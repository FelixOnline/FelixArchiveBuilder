    "content": "Page 2 FELIX February 13th,1973 Letter\nSice one,\nCyril!\nSir,\nThere now follows the text\nof a Very Exclusive Interview Indeed with Myself.\nYou state that 'Felix will\ncontinue to attempt to show\nall sides of the argument'\n(note to letter, page 2, col 1,\nFelix No. 327). I beg to\ndiffer. Felix has not yet\nshown all sides of the a rgu ment.\nLetters explaining some\nsocialist viewpoints have\nbeen forthcoming, even if\nthey appeared with the usual\nsectarian signatures [ see the\nCommunist Party of Britain\n(Marxist - Leninist) v. the\nCommunist Party of Great\nBritain (Stalinist*) in \"Exter-nal Affairs' 'at the Neasden\nHippodrome}. Where are the\nexplanations of dynamic Conservatism (almost as much of\nan oxymoron as \"Young Conservative\")? I find a neutered\nCatnip column, and letters\ndisagreeing with the CPBM-L militant here in earth. Where\nare the articles which suggest that banks should build\nhalls of residence and point\nout that they might well be\nfinanced in part by the massive repayments on private\nloans \u2014 loans such as young\ncouples must take out to start\na home at the price levels of\na free, competitive market?\nFelix shows both sides of the\nargument?\nI suspect, Mr. Dowson,\nthat you could write an excellent article extolling the\nvirtues of Conservatism /cap-it al is m and free enterprise,\nincluding the usual references\nto late delivery which seem\nto be a plague of the British\nPrint Industry (and don't say\nthat strikes are the cause!).\nWhen will it appear? Why\nmust we be content with\nludicrous editorials telling us\nwe are middle class and\nshould therefore choose\nto remain politically im pot ent? Why is a member of an\nopposing faction ridiculed,\nand then his suggestion that\nFelix should be partisan\ncalled \"sheer hypocrisy\"?\nSome may say it already is.\nI believe, Mr. Dowson, that\nalthough Felix has improved\nin some ways, you are still\ntrying it on. \"Don't take a letter to the DES\" indeed.\nYou know very well it is too\nlate to unseat you from your\nsabbatical without conclusively writing off Felix for this\nyear at least. I say no more.\nYours,\nROB ARMITAGE and\nSIMON ALLNUTT\n* Apologies to John and7 comrades. Keep recruiting. More on\nFelix's Politics\nSir,\nMr. Gillett's letter last week\nwas not, as you claimed, advocating the suppression of\nfree speech. Surely quite the\nopposite, in that Felix, as a student newspaper, should\ndiscuss all the issues involved which affect stud-ents; in particular the grants\ncampaign and the defence of\nstudent rights. You, like so\nmany other great advocates\nof free speech, felt the need\nto bend over backwards to\ngive extra coverage to a non-student (Mr. Mooney) in an\narticle attacking our grants\ncampaign. You gave that\narticle front page coverage\nand did not even bother to\nobtain any comments from\nthe NUPE shop stewards who\nare in a better position to\nknow what their membership\nfeels than their \"boss\" Mr.\nMooney.\nThose people who cry\nloudest about free speech are\namongst the first to justify\nthe need for censorship. Over\nthe suppression of Granada's 'World in Action' programme\non the Poulson Affair, not one\nnewspaper's editorial (those\ngreat bastions of free speech)\nspoke out against this blatant censorship.\nJ. VEALL\nAPOLOGY\nThe Editor would like to\napologise for any ill feeling caused by his notes to Mr. Gillett' s letter last week. IS3S JJ\nFrench\nLetter to\nEditor\nSir,\nIn replying to Adolf von\nWeaselgrope, could I quote\nfrom F. Temple Kingson's book \"French Existentialism\n\u2014 a Christian critique'.\n'The non-Christian existentialists make a distinction between the cogito pre-reflexive\nand the cogito reflective. It is\nupon the ambiguity based on\nthis distinction that their two\nmethods of communication\nare founded. For the non-Christian existentialists, the\npre-reflective cogito concerns\nan immediate awareness in\nsense, experience, emotion\nand action that precedes any\nobject if ying by the mind'.\nI remain yours essentially,\nJEAN-PAUL SARTRE\n(Name and address supplied)\nED.: Thanks for suggesting the\" Fascist Contraception s\" headline \u2014 hope you approve of the adaptation. Encore\nSonia\nSir,\nReferring to Chris Stevens'\nletter, he seems to think that\npure research is totally use-less, i.e. is unprofitable.\nSurely he must realise that\nresearch is a long term in-vestment. Some of the research may turn out to be\nuseless, other research produces results which are very\nprofitable. Unfortunately for\nthe bourgeoisie they cannot\npredict the results in ad-vance. There does take place\nsome research \"for the sake\nof it\" but somebody has to\npay for this \u2014 either the government or industry \u2014 neither of whom are prone to\npaying out money without\nseeing a return. It is very\ndifficult to get government\ngrants for research without\ngi iv ng good justification for\nit. So regrettably the profit\nmotive extends even here. It\nis only when the profit motive\nhas been totally abolished\nthat research too will serve\nthe people.\nAs for the bourgeoisie not\ntaking action to make the\nmost from education \u2014 that\nis exactly what they are\ndoing\u2014by providing e duca tion.\nYours sincerely,\nSONIA HO CHFELDER\nA Plea\nSir,\nWe feel there is a certain\nlack of clarity in some of the\nideas put forward in the\ngrants campaign. Therefore\nto help build an effective\ncampaign we issued the enclosed leaflet on the grants\ndemo, where it was favourably received \u2014 so far as\nwe could assess. Will you\nplease therefore print it in\nFelix.\nYours in Springtime hope,\nPIERS CORBYN\n(1st letter for 1 year)\nADRIAN SMITH\nI 'll seriously consider it \u2014\nbut sorry, it came too late\nfor this week's issue. \u2014\u2022 ED. Solidarity\nChallenge\nSir.\nA student-worker relationship to fight the freeze gain\nhigher grants for students:\nthese slogans begin to look\nsick when letters attacking\ndefenceless workers are allowed to be printed in FELIX.\nI am not in fact saying that\nFelix should censor all let-ter s, but that the students\nand Lane in particular should\ncome to the defence of these\nworkers. CEFE is the only\npublication which does this\nin fact, and I firmly believe\nthat the article proving that\nthe Hall cleaners' wages\nwere not the reason why the\nHall fees were so high compelled the management to issue a denial of possible cutbacks in hall cleaning staff.\nCome on, John, stop sitting\non the fence; if you really\nwant a good student-worker\nrelationship in IC then prove\nit in next week's FELIX.\nRON PARKER\n(Nupe)\nEven\nmore\nboring\nSir,\nI was most distressed to\nsee that your correspondent\nMr. Ulyanov ('Letters', February 6th,1973) suffers from\nthat extremely discomforting\ndisease ' tau to phony'. It\ncaused me such sorrow to\nsee a brother in this piteous\nstate that I would humbly,\nthrough the accommodating\nmedium of your esteemed\ncolumns, proffer treatment\nfor his relief.\nDear, dear Comrade\nCamp-balls, there is an ancient proverb (formulated\nwhen all our ancestors were\nrevelling in the delights of\ntotal social freedom) stating\nthat \"empty vessels make the\nmost sound\". Perhaps, as a dialectic ally thinking scientist (or have you recanted?)\nyou would agree with the\nadvice that, if you stopped\nspouting, in a short while\nenough spunk would have\naccumulated for you to perform the actions and not just\nthe motions.\nIf this fails \u2014 God forbid\n\u2014 then may I suggest that\nyou adopt the prescription of\nAaetius, of a firm cucumber\napplied internally.\nYours in Hippocrates,\nH. el EBORE\nAdolf's Answer\nSir,\nMy letter two weeks ago\nstimulated a response which\nI thoroughly anticipated, and\nwhich I have no intention of\nignoring.\nIt was rather fun to see\nMr. R. \"Gosh, haven'tI got\na lovely beard, lads,\" Appleby continuously contradicting\nhimself in a whole column\nof \"pointless derogatory\nand back-biting remarks\",\nwritten apparently against\nhis will. Poor chap \u2014 one\ncould almost detect the walrus tear-stains on the paper.\nOne would hope (though in\nvain, I fear), that any future\narticles from Broadsheet,\nwhose only correspondent\nappears to be its editor, will\ndiscuss subjects of greater\ninterest.\nIncidentally, as a reader of\nof Guildsheet, Mr. Appleby\nshould be well acquainted\nwith my nom-de-plume.\nWhile being factually more\ncorrect than his article, my\nletter was not, as he pointed\nout, written in the most\nserious of veins, and I saw\nno reason to make an exception with the signature.\nSuffice it to say that I am\nfamiliar enough with Mr.\nAppleby to put my views to\nhim personally if I so wished\n(or to put cyanide in his\nbeer).

    "content": ":\nFebruary 13th,1973 FELIX Page 7\nAN INTELLECTUAL WEEKEND\nFour times a year, the weekend solitude of Silwood\nPark field station is upset by the arrival of a coach load of pseudo-intellectuals under the TOUCHSTONE ban-ner. Occasionally FELIX manages to infiltrate a pseudo-reporter into this exclusive group. Our chance\nthis year came with Lawrence Burton who spoke on \"Democracy versus the Expert\".\nHISTORY( frequently) self-appointed\nTouchstone first saw exPerts' From the days light of day when Sir Rod when Newton first stifled eric Hill( rector of the\n50's) made the initial\nmoves in IC towards General Studies. Its format,\nlike college attitudes to\nGeneral Studies, has\nchanged very little since.\nThis is not intended as criticism (of Touchstone)\nthough which has acquired a character and tradition belying its comparatively short existence.\nFORM For the multitudes who have never enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of a Touchstone weekend( would you believe even\nmore people go through\ncollege without a Touchstone than all those who never go to Union meet-in gs?) a quick review of\nform shouldn't go amiss.\nThe weekend starts outside\nthe Union Arch at 1415\nhrs Saturday when the\ncoach arrives to take us\naway (ha, ha). Upon arrival at Silwood we start\neating, and eating, and eat-ing, and . . . (more resemblance to a Gourmet's Gobble than an intellectual weekend). Interspersed\nbetween meals come a talk\nby the speaker, discussion\ngroups, a walk in the park\n(or read of Sunday newspapers depending on wea-ther) and a review of the\ndiscussion topic by the\nspeaker. At1600 hrs Sunday the coach returns to\nthe hallowed precincts of\nIC proper. Since, owing to\ncollege subsidies, you get\nall this for only \u00a31.00,\neverybody (even you, my boy) can afford to go \u2014\nyour esteemed reporter\nwholeheartedly recommends it.\nTECHNOLOGY v. THE INDIVIDUAL So to the subject of last\nweekend's discussion,\nDemocracy versus the Ex pert\". General consensus\nwas quick to agree that the\ntopic had the makings of\na\" good\" Touchstone\n(don't forget, they know\n. . . they've practically all been before!) being almost\ninfectious in its appeal.\nAs technology advances\nwe become increasingly\nunable to counter the\nviews and agreements\nplaced before us by our general discussion of the\nconcepts of mechanics (by\nhis new, mathematical, ap-p roach) experts have been\nendeavour ing to elevate\ntheir status above the\ncoffee-room proletariat.\nDo you know more about\nConcorde than the brains\nof BAC? A CHANCE? Fortunately there has\nbeen a concurrent increase\nin media-coverage which\nattempts to provide basic\nfacts (e.g. Piccadilly). This\nis a necessary prerequisite\nfor general consumer par-tic ip ation, which should\nundoubtedly follow. There\nare exceptions to be noted\nhere though when (e.g. shoes, cars) it is questionable whether the consumer\nactually gets what he\nwants; or what advertisements tell him he wants\u2014\nremembering that experts\nhave ideals (special shoes,\nsafety cars) which far from\nbeing attained, aren't even\nbeing moved towards.\nKIDS Touchstone discussion\ngroups follow general\nquestion time guides. The speaker questioned \" Who decides how to bring up children\u2014parents or child-psychologists?\" similarly\n\" Who runs schools and colleges?\" It was agreed\nthat within limits democracy may be intended\nwithin a university but\nwithin the wider const ratings of society pressures\nare brought to bear overruling the wishes of those\nmost immediately con-cern ed. PADS? Term-planning was considered too. In the question of the \"Englishman's Castle\" how can conflicting opinions all be taken\ninto account. How many\nnew towns are aesthetically appealing to the passing visitor and yet unsuited\nto the permanent inhab i tant?\nSo to the question of\ntransfer r able expertise. It\nis incredible how many\nexperts in one field (one of\nyour department's profs?)\nare consulted, in an expert\ncapacity, in totally unrelated fields. Perhaps, bluff\nand deception play a large\npart with such people.\nPonder for a while, when\nyou hear an \"expert\" \u2014\nare you the right kind of\nexpert to be quoted on this\nsubject?\nYOU This article is NOT in tended to review personal\nopinions expressed during\none weekend at Silwood\nPark. I have endeavour ed to prompt YOU the reader\nto think, so try these guidelines :\nThink about the Touchstone questions noted above\nand think about coming to\na Touchstone weekend in the future\nand Go along to listen to\nLawrence Burton when\nyou next have the opportunity. Finally I, the FELIX reporter, would like to\nthank Mr. Mc Do wall, General Studies, for having me along, and MC B for giving me a lift (with\nseven other passengers) in the Jowitt - christened\nKosher Kit-e Kat Carrier\nExpress.\nTHE MARXIST REF RIG ERAT Q8 OF IC In a Welsh farm setup by BRAD \u2014 Bio technic Research and Development \u2014 a heat pump is being built which will warm the house by extracting heat from a nearby stream. Yes. It sounded a bit silly tome. It works as a sort of inverted refrigerator with Freon being pumped between the house and the stream. The Freon is heated by the water and, after being pumped back to the house, cools and thus heats the house by an evaporation/ condensation cycle. I had never thought of that sort of possibility from my knowledge of refrigeration gleaned a tI.C.( which may say little for my imagination). But surely, with the probable impending ex i guity of energy \u2014 and energy is inherent in the teaching of Science and Technology \u2014 the social implications of present energy consumption and ideas, developments and research into new energy forms and ways of harnessing existing sources \u2014 wind, solar energy, etc. \u2014 ought to be basic to any syllabus a tI.C. Why this is not so is because the curriculum mortis a tI.C. is establishment orientated particularly towards the needs of industry. Now, since it seems to be the thing to do in Felix to interpret every single facet of modern society in terms of what Marx wrote nearly a century a go,I thought I'd have ago. One thing Marx believed was that the culture \u2014 art forms, literature etc. \u2014\nof a society should interpret that society rather than implant ideas from outside it. This tome is one of the worst of Marx' s concepts, stifling free expression which, in its many forms, is essential to the development of a better society. Technology is inherent to any modern Western culture and that practised a tI.C., being mainly orientated within the framework of the society, is therefore taught in the best traditions of Marxism. Logic of this sort is of value as a bit of a giggle and little else. Logic and objectivity area necessary tool of modern Technology, but it cam be wrongly used where critical subjectivity and compassion area better alternative. The idea of setting0.001% population affected, say, as a\" safe\" JOHN B. STARES\" permissible\" level of pollution or radiation is surely a wrong approach, particularly if you are one of the0.001%( one of about30,000 in the World). It is certainly true that the problems created as side effects of Technology cannot be solved by further Technology alone and it is essential, therefore, that the teaching of Technology propounds the sort of approach that BRAD has under consideration. This God industry, this great energy consumer and GNP worshipper, is still producing masses of its products with little consideration towards the byproducts they liberate. In my department( Public Health Engineering) each student is making a survey of the effluent treatment and disposal methods of a particular industry. Many companies have refused to sanction students visiting them. Many have had the crass rudeness to not even reply.( Presumably there is little financial return in students hang n ground your factory.) And those who have given a positive response are mainly the larger, international Corporations who, being susceptible to public opinion, are doing quite aPR job on their pollution abatement successes. The teaching orientation a tI.C. will probably change only very slowly. The momentum of institutions such as this is sluggish, principally because the teachers are primarily researchers and most research is heavily committed towards industry. Hence a natural conservatism results in the curriculum and its proponents. Many, too many, technologists efficaciously carry on their research and development work into some detail without ever considering the implications of the whole. Peter Laurie, in a recent Sunday Times article discussing the PostOffice defence system sited around the country, said of the engineers who had designed them:\" Few of them have any idea what they' redoing or why they' redoing it . . . if you speak, as I have often done, with the engineers... and ask them why their tower is on this hill and not that one, they don't know. It\nis not part of their job to ask that kind of question....\" Perhaps it ought to be. MARTIN DOUGHTY. CEFE on the grants campaign\nWe demand a living grant\n\u2014 end the means test now\nWe want more money \u2014\nstarving isn't funny\n\u00a3100 now\nThese were some of the\nslogans of the demonstration last Wednesday; the\nfirst action of the grants\ncampaign mIC. For the\nfirst time IC students\nturned words into deeds\nand came out on the street\ndemanding higher grants.\nBut demonstrations alone\nachieve little. They certainly don't force the government to do anything\nand the publicity value is\nminimal. We have already\nshown by voting in favour\nof refectory boycotts that\nwe know it is only by putting pressure on the college authorities and thus\nthe government that we\ncan win our demands.\nThe refectory boycotts\nare a start to effective\naction. The college authorities are already very\nworried about the consequences and Mooney is\nattempting to get a25 per\ncent increase in prices. We must be aware of this and\nbe prepared to take action\nagainst any such price\nrises. By boycotting the\nrefectories we are hitting\nthe college authorities at\ntheir weakest point, since\nthe refectories have to be\nself financing; our actions\nthus have the greatest\neffect. This is therefore a tactically correct way to\nbegin our campaign. Those\nwho came on the demonstration must now work to\nexplain to the rest of the\nstudents why we are boycotting the refectories, and\nget them to see the need\nfor such action, thus building up support and getting\nmore students involved.\nFor we can only continue\nour campaign if we have\ngreater awareness among\nthe rest of the students.\nFrom refectory boycotts\nwe can go on to lecture\nboycotts, occupations,\nshort-duration strikes, etc.,\nwhich disrupt the running\nof college and thus also put\npressure on the authorities.\nThese actions would involve all the students;\ntherefore those students\nwho were not on the demonstration and never go\nto union meetings must\nalso become convinced of\nthe need for action. The grants campaign must be\nextended. The harder we\nfight the greater will be our\nsuccess.\nAs regards students as\na whole the present action\nin which we are engaged\nis a very significant step\nforward. Students are now\ninvolved with issues which\ndirectly affect us and, having been forced into action\nby necessity, are learning!\nthat we have the strength!\nto win our demands pro-!\nvi ded we take effective\naction. In this we are in the same situation as the\nrest of the working class;\nhowever, we are only now\nbeginning to realise what\nother workers have realized all along: that it is\nonly through struggle that\nwe can defend out inter-est s. The fight for a decent\nstandard of living will not\nend with the present cam-pa ign. Even \u00a3100 hardly\nbrings us back to the 1962\nlevel let alone gives us any\nreal increase. As long as\nprices continue to rise\nthere will always be the\nneed to fight for higher\ngrants. The strength and\nexperience gained in this\ncampaign will serve us in the future.\nICU Elections\nNominations are now open for the main posts\nof the union including the\nsabbatical posts. The strength of the union of course depends on the\nawareness and involvement of the members but\ngood strong leadership is\nessential. The grants campaign throughout the country has shown that\nwe need a union prepared\nto take action to defend\nthe interests of its mem-be rs. The President of the\nunion must be actively involved in leading the\nunion to fight against all attacks on students and\nget all students involved\nin action. We call on all students to vote for the\ncandidate who has demonstrated these qualities.\nSONIA HOCH F ELDER ISRAEL% Be there for the 25th Anniversary\ncelebrations ISHflttS ZSth f tNN I WEBS ft rlY TOURS TICKETS\nTRAVEL KIBBUTZ\nComplete programme of ISTC flights, trains, ships from\nHOSTS STUDENT\nTRAVEL SERVICE LTD.\n161 GREAT PORTLAND ST, W1N 6NN Telephone 01-580 7733\n\n"

G. \u2014 or how to understand the nut behind you Superficially, the \" political scene\" in Imperial\nCollege Union seems to\ncomprise 3 groups.\n1. \"The A pathis t\" who\nnever turns up to\nanything.\n2. \"The wish y was hy liberal \u2014 cum \u2014 2 0 per\ncent reactionary \u2014\ncum \u2014let's keep-the lefties out.\n3. \"The Left\" who may\nbe regarded as the\nprime mover of the\npolitical scene.\nHowever, the classification above does not by\nany means define the\nstate of the problems.\n\" The A pathis t\" subdivision is not solely comprised of the people we\nlike to think of who are\nnot aware, cannot be informed and whose only\noccupation is the pursuit\nof a degree. Included in\nthe group are the \"defeat-is ts\"( as John Lane would call them) who are\nthe people who think the\nUnion can achieve nothing and deliberately opt\nout of UG Ms. The Union\ncannot affect them, they\nhave no wish to affect the\npolitical activities of the\nUnion, often their views\nare not reflected by the\na poem The Archbishop of Canterbury came\nTo IC the other day.\nHe talked for an hour\nTo Mech Eng 220\nFull of members of\nGodsoc and\nJesus freaks and\nMonks and\nNuns and\nCameramen ahd\nMe,\nAnd my mate Keith.\nSomeone asked\nWhat is the devil?\nAnd he replied in a Posh and\nPortly voice\nThat the devil was\nMany devils\nSome of which may be\nAliens.\nFrom other planets.\nHe once experienced an\nEvil\nSo terrifying\nThat it must have been\nSupernatural or\nExtraterrestial.\nBut he quickly added that\nMost evil is caused by\nUs humans.\nMy mate Keith thinks that\nAll evil\nIs caused by fat people\nWho live in\nPalaces and\nMansions and\nWho preach at others so that\nThey do\nWhat the fat people want\nThem to do.\nHe says God is a Crutch\nFor people who can't Come to terms with\nObjective reality.\nHe is very c! ever but has\nNo soul.\nSo what ?\nWith apologies to\nTharg (17).\nE.

The Union is more\nof a social organisation,\na facility that helps them\nplay sport, and continue\nother pursuits.\nNo, the people who\ndon't turn up aren'tall a pathis ts in the true sense\nof the word; their decision\nis a conscious one.\nThe second group is\nperhaps the most difficult\nto define; sometimes it\ncould be said that they\nare the floating voters. The\n\" Left\" often label some\nof them the obstacles of\ndemocracy when they\nchallenge the quorum with only 150 people pre-sent. They are often the\nmost patient at UG Ms; they will wait through the\nusually low standard debate to vote with their\nconscience on matters\nsuch as Vietnam or Northern Ireland. On matters\nlike that, the wish y was hy Liberal's vote rarely floats.\nOne could say that they\nturn up out of duty. Whether or not they are the\nmain launchers of paper\ndarts is debatable!\nThat leaves \"the Left.\"\nThe tide of public opinion of the rest of political\nthought (or lack of it, say\nthe Left)! is that once\nyou've seen one Lefty,\nyou've seen 'em all. No th ing could be further from\nthe truth. The Left is\nsplit, not only by its\ndefinite subdivisions into\nvarious factions, but more\ndistinctly by the attitudes\ndisplayed by the factions\nthemselves IMG( Interna-t ional Marxist Group),\nYSSS ( Young Socialists\nStudents Society and the\nCP( Communist Party)\nare the three main contenders in the Left.\nThe rivalry between\nthe groups is perhaps best\ndemonstrated by a few of\nthe happenings at ICU GM s. The CP idea\n\" Take a Letter to the\nDES\" was shot to pieces\nat the last U GM by the\nMarxists who called for\nindividual letters and support for our actions.\nQuestions.\n1.

If you support nos\namis, support our\nactions \u2014 Black September Movement.\nThe CP line was to appeal to as many people as\npossible, the IMG opposed purely on principle,\nsubstituted altruistic nonsense in its place, confused the U GM and jeo-pardi sed the Take a Letter campaign.\nMeanwhile, the Y SSS is\nbattling away in favour of\nsupplementary grants,\nshunning publicity as next\nto useless, and basing its\naspirations on a mass\nmovement involving all\nthe working and lower\nclasses to force the Tories\netc.\nEven more depressing,\nthan this petty political\nmano eu ve ring is the current policy of both Y SSS and IMG and, to a lesser\nextent, the CP of no-negotiation. The methods of\nTio-Pepe Diplomacy have\nbeen rejected because of\nalleged sellouts, but perhaps they were unable to\nproduce any decent TP Diplomats. The latest\nweapon of the Left is that\nof just stating the demand\nand allowing no com pro mise.\nEffectively, they send\nround a memo to the offending person/body/in-st it uti on stating their de-m and s, and receive a polite reply telling them\nwhat do with them.\nThe whole procedure\nsmacks of lack of style\nand puerile adolescence.\nMeanwhile, under the\nleadership of the split left\nand a confused centre,\nICU must somehow push\nthe grants campaign\nalong. It is not likely to\ndo so until the wounds in the left heal, if only tem-por ari ly, and UG Ms become reasoned and co-operative. The campaign\nwill not be won by high-powered political dogma\nfrom the Left or by low-powered non-cooperation\nfrom all sections, but will be won if the Union can\nadvance on all fronts by\nusing tactics of truth and\nhonesty in stating the\nfacts.\nPAUL JO WITT IN' S on C oak room^ Neither the Union nor the College will accept responsibility\nfor things that have been lost or stolen.

Some of this sail has got to\ncome down.\" Complaining, the trio wriggled\ntheir way out into the open. The strength\nof the wind was increasing all the time, and\nthe leeward gunwale was under water. \"I want the main and the stay sail down, we'll\nbe fine on the mizzen and jib alone,\" shouted George over the rising howl of the wind.\nHe was already letting his sails flog to take\nsome of the pressure off his ancient craft.\nThe cracking and flapping of the huge\ncanvas shook the whole boat, and the rigging throbbed and vibrated in the wind. Gingerly the adventurers scrabbled their way\nalong the rolling deck, and attempted to\nlower the mainsail. The Twigworm was more\nhindrance than help, falling over ropes, and\nbeing struck repeatedly over the head\nwith the boom. But despite this living han-di cap, Ferocious and Phosphorous managed\nto lower the mainsail and the stay sail. George was able to pay off a little, the remaining sails filled, and the old boat felt\nmore at ease again. The now soaking wet\ncrew made their unsteady way back to the\nrelative shelter of the cockpit.\nFanny thrashed her way through the\nsteep e ning waves, bursting through the\ncrest of one, and dropping bodily into the\ntrough of the next. Great gallons of green\nwater exploded into the cockpit; streams of\nspray were flung back from the rigging, and\nsalt stung the faces of the crew, making\nthem duck behind the deck house.\" I think I'm going to be sick,\" said the\nTwigworm precipitately.\n\"To leeward, if you have to,\" said George\nquickly.\n\"Where?\" asked the Twigworm.\n\"That way,\" said George pointing down\nwind. With some jostling the Twigworm\npositioned himself, staring over the leeward\nrail in a sickly manner. Secretly Ferocious\nwas feeling a mite queasy himself, but he\nfelt bound to keep silent, seeing as the\nTwigworm had already mentioned the sub-j ect. \"Not something I want to bring up at\npresent,\" he thought and regretted it.\nBy this stage it was difficult to see much\nfurther than the end of the bowsprit, as\nthe spray blew across the boat in solid\nsheets, and the wind watered their eyes.\nThe Twigworm was violently sick.\n\"So that's what the poet meant by 'blown\nspume' \" thought Ferocious, thankful that\nthe Twig had taken George's advice about\nwhich side of the boat to stand. But all\nthoughts of poets were soon swept from\nFerocious mind as he joined the Twigworm\nat the rail.\nGeorge, however, was in fine fettle, his\nhair plastered to his head, salt encrusting\nhis eyebrows, he hummed a nautical ditty.\nPhosphorous'too felt pretty good, and was\nrather enjoying himself. He beamed at\nGeorge.\n\"I suppose that's what sailors call 'heav-ing together'\" he said pointing to the dishevelled forms of the Twigworm and Ferocious. The latter was not amused.\n\" 0 callous chum,\" he moaned, \"were I not on the verge of leaving this mortal\ncoil, I wouldn't half land you one.\" His head\nshot back over the side of the boat. Phosphorous' kind heart was stirred, and he\nwas just stepping forward to help his\nfriend, when George gave a shout.\n\"Look! The Twigwormery!\" Sure enough,\nthrough the torn seas they could see the\nfloating refuse tip outline of the Twigwormery \u2014 shooting down wind at the rate of\nseveral knots.\n\"After it!\" shouted Phosphorous, and\nGeorge lean t hard on the tiller. Round\nswung the old vessel, rolling as she lay\nmomentarily broadside on in the trough of\na wave, then steadying as she came off the\nwind, the sheets run out, and finally surging away down wind. Now that they were\nno longer fighting their way to windward,\nthere was less water in the cockpit, and\nthe Fanny was surfing along on the crests\nof the waves.\nThe Twigworm seemed to have recovered instantaneously,\n\"Ooh, ooh,\" he squeaked, \"quickly, oh\ndear, do stop it, catch it, oh faster\nplease.\"\n\"Doing my best\", said George. They seemed\nto be going at three hundred miles an hour,\nstreaking down the face of one wave, and\nshooting off the top of the next. But the\nTwigwormery was not hanging around. Its\nhuge surface area acted as a sail, carrying-it along at express train speed. However, it\nwas not exactly sleek of hull, and the Fanny\nslowly began to catch it up.\n\"Oh, oh, we're gaining on it,\" shouted the\nTwigworm, turning blue in the face with\nexcitement, \"Mummy, Daddy,\" he cried, \"it's me, Gosport.\"\n\"Gosport?\" said a green-gilled, incredulous Ferocious, \"is that your name?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the Twigworm, \"did I not\nmention it before? I am sorry. It just never\ncame into the conversation.\" Ferocious was\nflabbergasted.\n\" All this time,\" he said, \"and we've been\ncalling you the Tiny Twigworm, when you\nhave actually got a name all along. Well,\nwell. What kind of a name is 'Gosport' any-way?\" The Twigworm looked a little sheep-ish.\n\" Um,\" he said, \"you see the Twigwormery\nwas floating past Gosport at the time of my\nbirth, and my parents thought it would be\na good name for me.\" \"I 've heard worse,\"\nsaid Ferocious.\n\"I think it is a very nice name,\" said\nPhosphorous, encouragingly, \"but perhaps\nwe should go on calling you Twig, to avoid\nconfusion.\"\n\"Good thinking, Phosphorous,\" said Ferocious, \"Twig you were and Twig you remain \u2014 we can keep Gosport for formal\noccasions only.\"\n\"I don't mind at all,\" said the obliging\nTwigworm.\nThey were now only forty or fifty yards\nbehind the Twigwormery, and they could\nmake out a large Twigworm throwing a bucket full of potato peelings over the side.\n\" Look!\" squealed the Twigworm, \"It's my\nUncle Tubing throwing out the rubbish. He\nwaved his rubbery arms and squeaked but\nUncle Tubing did not seem to notice.\n\" Bit slow on the uptake is he? Your Uncle Whatnot?\" asked Ferocious. He\nnever received his answer for George suddenly gave a cry and fell spluttering to\nthe floor of the cockpit. Without her\nowner's hand on the helm. Fanny swung\ninto the wind, heeling frantically as she did\nso, and tipping the crew into a wriggling\nheap. It seemed that once again the Twigwormery was going to escape them.\nFelix No. 328, Tuesday, February 13, 1973 was edited by Oliver Dowson. Also implicated\nwere (in alphabetical order): Martin C.

A very mixed film\n\u2014 very heavy in places but generally\nvery exciting. Strong acting through-out.\nThe Ruling Class (X) Peter 0 Toole, Alastair Sim, Arthur Lowe. The best film I 've seen this year.\nPeter O Toole is the lunatic 14th Earl\nof Gurney with a Jesus fix at 'on\nforced to take over the family seat\nwhen his father accidentally hangs\nhimself while indulging in his private\nperversion. This film mainly takes a dig at Public Schools, the Upper Classes and the Monarchy but is very\nfunny as well. A trifle long, but well worth sitting through.\nFritz the Cat (X) Cartoon Hard to follow in places, unless\nyou'r ewell up in American Slang. Basically satirical, but generally\nfunny if you like ultra-obscene car-toons. Not to be missed, just for the\nexperience.\nThe Godfather (X) Marlon Brando and a cast of thousands. Not by any means as good as the\nbook \u2014 a highly compressed version. I didn't think much of the acting, except Marlon Brando, who is incoherent anyway. The violence is very well staged indeed, though. The Getaway (X)Al iMac G raw, Steve McQueen. Sheer escapism( pun). Cops and Robbers reversed (Steve McQueen' s the goodie crook). A nice wholesome happy ending plus StandardS am Peckinpah violence. Go and see it.\nThe House That Dripped Blood/Tales\nFrom the Crypt.\nBoth these films are a collection of short horror stories and some superb cameo roles, e.g. Jon Pertwee as\nDracula, and Sir Ralph Richardson as\na monk. But you must realise they\nare all tongue in cheek \u2014 very dry\ncomedy if you like. Highly recommended. 'Jergei'\nWIZZARD & SHARKS\nFor the first time this year the hall\nwas comparatively empty, and I didn't have to make a rather undignified\nrush to get a seat. Sharks opened the\nnight's entertainment and played a very competent set. I never thought\nI'd hear anyone who sounded remotely like Joe Cocker, but Snips has his\npower, and comparisons are in evi table. Chris Sped ding played his Les\nPaul like the good guitarist that he is,\nMarty Simon drummed crisply and Andy Fraser started on electric piano,\nbut later moved over to his more familiar role as bassist. The audience rec eiv ed them well, though it was still\nrather surprising when they came back for an encore after the house-lights were put on. When Wizard came on I thought\nI was seeing double, but on closer inspection this proved not to be the\ncase. There actually were two drum mers and two saxophonists, along with four, others. Their music was loud and raucous, and they played several tracks from their forthcoming album\" We're Off To See the W izzard\". This was obvious from the\nfirst number, which contained some stereophonic touches on double bass.\nThe next two, \" Buffalo Station\", and\" Get on Down to Memphis\", were rolled into one. Then came the long\none, with solos on sax, lead guitar\nand drums with Bill Hunt leaping\naround bashing and throwing about\ntambourines, and occasionally th um ping the keyboards to earn his keep.\nAnother of those unpleasant heckling incidents, after which they finished\nwith Ball Park Incident to a standing audience. G.J. K.A Century of Traction Engines\nW. J. Hughes \u2014 Pan Books \u00a3 1 . 2 5\nIn this book, with its 2 6 2 pages\npacked with facts and181 black and white illustrations, Mr. Hughes has\nresisted the temptation to produce a pretty pretty book, fit only for Habitat\ncoffee tables. He has written a most interesting and readable account of\nthe changing fortunes of steam traction engines.\nFrom Trevithick' s steam carriage\nof 1801 to Fowler's1917\" Excelsior\", the technical development is\ndescribed with the loving pride of a true enthusiast. A minimum of jargon\nis used so that the layman is able to\nfollow the progress made by the early\npioneers. The later chapters deal with the developed engines and the varied work that they successfully under-took. This, for me, was the most interesting section of the book.\nThe change in the style of ill u strat ing, over the years, is very marked and the most surprising feature being\nthe obvious superiority of the old eng ravings over the photograph for rec-or ding technical detail. For anyone who enjoys visiting traction engine rallies and would like\nto know more about the subject then\nthis is the book to buy.\nSilas Marner\nGeorge Eliot \u2014 Pan\nFor the benefit of all who suffer\nfrom insomnia, here is my latest cure.\nGo early to bed with a cup of hot\nchocolate, a packet of custard creams and a copy of Silas Marner. By chap ter three you will either be fast asleep\nor engrossed in the life story of Silas, the miser with a heart of gold. If, like me, you were once force\nfed English literature by a schoolmarm who bore a marked resemblance to Mary Whitehouse, then you\nmay surprise yourself by enjoying this\nlatest Pan Classic. I found the basic\nstory predictable, overpowering ly moralistic and sentimental, but the\nway in which the tale is presented,\nthe wry descriptions of the country\ncha act ers and their attitudes to each\nother, prevented me from throwing it\naway in favour of a modern blood and thunder.\nThis book is not suitable for child ren as they will quickly become bored\nby the sweet unreality of the life por-t rayed, but for anyone longing for a refuge from the television news I rec om mend this work by George Eliot.\nR.T.S MYTH FELIX\nTUESDAY,13 th FEBRUARY1235 Cath Soc Mass, Chem231.1300 STOIC presents a look behind the scenes\nduring the making of a programme from the current \" Morecambe and Wise\" series,\non TV in J CR and Southside.

There will be a GRANTS DE MOON FEB RLA R\\21st by all the colleges and universities in the southern\nregion. We have to give massive support to this demo\nas it is of crucial importance to all students.\nThe objectives of the NUS who have called it are\nthreefold:\u2014\n(i)An immediate payment to all students over and\nabove their present grant and to be tied to inflation\nthrough annual reviews of the cost of living for all\nstudents.\n(ii) The abolition of the means test and discretionary awards system so that all students be given the\nmaximum grant.\n(iii) The tallying of the notional element in grants\nfor accommodation to the actual cost of Hall fees (in-clu ding meals).\nBriefly sketched, their reasons are that this year we\nwere given an increase of 3 % p.a.. but the present\nindustrial rate of inflation is 8 % p.a. and the rate of\ninflation of those things that students spend most on \u2014\nfood, rent, clothes and books\u2014is now 1 5 % and in-creasing. Parents are finding it increasingly difficult to\npay the parental contribution owing to inflation striking at their standards of living, so it is important to\nensure that all students receive the same grant and\nthis can be done by abolishing the means test. Any woman student who wants to get married is having to\nseriously consider her post-marital financial situation,\nundoubtedly she would find a vast cut in her grant as\nthe maximum discretionary award she could get is\n\u00a3275 p.a. Moreover this amount is assess able on her\nhusband's income and could therefore be even less\nthan the present paltry maximum allowance she would\nbe given. In many areas hall fees greatly exceed the\nnotional element in the grant\u2014this is very true at I.C. if one were to eat all one's meals at Mooney, despite\nthe seemingly small hall fees.\nOur grants are decreasing in value, our standard of\nliving is falling\u2014this is a situation which demands\naction by all students now!\nWhat kind of action can we take? The NUS advocates nationwide rent strikes, refectory boycotts, petitions, demonstrations and any show of student solidarity\nover this issue.\nIn order to understand why this form of economic\nand political action is necessary rather than sending\nletters to MPs, or relying on the Committee for Vice\nChancellors and Principals ( CVC P) to simply show\nthe worthiness of our case to the government, we have\nto analyse why the present situation has occurred, and\nwhat has prompted the NUS to take such measures.\nAny such analysis must be incomplete unless it looks\nat all of the present worldwide political and economic\nspectrum.\nI he grants debate must be set in the context of the\npresent international crisis of capital. International\ncapitalism entered an inflationary boom cycle in 1^45\nwith the intention of pacifying the dangerously militant\nworking class of Europe. In so doing it evaded one\ncrisis but paved the way for a yet more extensive and\ndamaging one in the future, and this is the situation in\nwhich we find ourselves now.\nThe present crisis is a crisis of value, in which the\nvalue of currency is in continuous decline, while the\nvalue of labour, reflected in an until recently increased\nstandard of living of the working class, is higher than\never before. It is essential for capitalism in each\ncountry to inject greater value into its currency at the\nexpense of foreign capitalism. To do this it must first\ncut the value of labour on its home free market.\nThe value of labour is determined in the same way as\nthe value of any other commodity, in terms of the\nlabour required for its production. The cost of labour\nis defined explicitly in \" Wage Labour and Capital\" as\n\"the cost required for maintaining the worker as a worker and of developing him into a worker.\" to which\nMarx later adds the cost of replacing old labour power\nwith new, i.e. the cost of maintenance of dependents.\nThe cost of maintaining a worker is a minimum if\nthe worker is living at subsistence level, and any increase in standard of living above this level implies an\nincrease in the value, and hence cost, of that worker's labour (strictly, labour power). Thus any attempt to\nlower the cost of labour must involve an attack on\nthe standard of living of workers. It is in this light\nthat we must approach issues such as the increasing\nof indirect taxation relative to direct taxation and the\ngeneral shift from taxing luxuries to taxing essentials;\nthe \" Fair\" Rents Act, the introduction of VAT and the\n\"wage freeze\" and other aspects of Phase II. This last,\nalong with entry to the EEC which will facilitate movement of capital from Britain to low-cost labour areas\nof the community and associate nations, and the Industrial Relations Act, constitute an attempt to emasculate the working class and prevent defence against\nattacks on standards of living.\nThese arguments cannot be appreciated however if\nuniversities are still viewed as training grounds for the\nruling class. In fact, this viewpoint has been shown to\nbe untenable by the upsurge in the last twenty years\nin vocation-based courses, the increase in involve men on the part of industry in academic courses and the\nRothschild report on research and the role of the Polytechnic. Perhaps nowhere can this be seen more clearly\nthan at IC where the courses are obviously simply\ntraining grounds for industry. Students at IC can have\nno false notions about being fledgling bourgeois\u2014their\nfuture is to be the highly skilled proletarians that are\nrequired by our extremely advanced technological\nsociety.\nThus students are as much proletarians as any manual worker. However the training required is such that\ntheir development into workers is a far more protracted\nprocess. Furthermore, the value of their labour power\nwhen it is finally produced is very high due to the high\ncost of developing such workers. So it comes as no\nsurprise that grant levels have fallen steadily since\n1962: that the Retail Price Index went up 6 % in the\nfirst half of last year while grants increased only 3 ^ % :\nthat \"rational is ation\" is the word of the day throughout further education, and there is talk of reducing\nsome three year courses to two years. All this is simply\na direct result of the international recession in cap\nit al is m. Seen in this way it is clear that letters to MPs arc\nutterly without effect. There is a lot to be gained however by working with the CVC P as long as their m.it ives are clearly understood. Each Vice Chancellor and\nPrincipal is solely concerned with keeping the peace\non their individual campus ses, because it is only in\nsuch an atmosphere that the colleges and universiti c can fulfil their tasks of training and research. Refectory and lecture boycotts are a method of disrupting\nthe quiet of college life as well as demonstrating student\nsolidarity, and on a wide scale can thus spur the CVC P to take action. But they will try any method short of\nsupporting our case in order to achieve peace, for\nexample Sir John Hackett, Principal of King's( Lon-don), has stated that any rent strike action occurring\nat King's will mean higher rents next year\u2014a move\nequivalent to blackmail.\nUnlike workers whose main economic weapon is to\nwithhold their labour, the only economic action that\nstudents can take is to not pa\\ their hall fees. Unfortunately, owing to the suicidal short-sightedness of\nthe large right-wing contingent (who will doggedly refuse to admit they are members of the working class\nuntil they are in their first jobs and fighting for their\nfirst pa j rise) at the union meeting where a motion\nconcerning this was raised, IC has voted away its sole\neconomic weapon in the grants fight.\nMiners, gas men, engineers and civil servants are\narranging to go on strike for the same reasons as are\ncausing us to fight for a grant increase, and so there\nwill be every opportunity for an alliance in the future\nwith those and other sections of the working class as\nthey begin to feel the attacks of Phase II.\nSo massive support for the demo on February 21st is absolutely essential as a way of displaying national\nstudent solidarity over this issue. We mean business,\nso let's show it!\nALAS D HAIR CAMPBELL& DAVID BEES ON OR you can tell Edward Heath that Queen of yours\nto tell Thatcher to lay off\nStudents.\nThe University authorities are at the moment still\ntaking action against students who allegedly took\npart in demonstrations and\nmeetings during the\nQueen's visit. The court\nproceedings are being held\nin secret, against the\nwishes of the accused.\nMinutes are, of course,\ntaken, but the independent stenographers were\ndismissed after two days,\nand the subsequent proceedings were recorded by\na college employee. When\n(after a delay of two\nweeks) the minutes were\nsupplied to the accused,\nthey discovered that these\nminutes were not an accurate record of the pro-cee dings. There are several other facts which\nhighlight the incompetence\nand the unfairness of the\ndisciplinary system.\n1. The defence has been\ncontinuously frustrated in\nthe over-ruling of quite\nproper objections.\n2. The disciplinary committee have continuously\ntried to rush through the\nproceedings, despite the\nfact that this has prejudiced the defence case.\n3. The prosecutors\n(members of the college\nauthority) are actually\nbeing called as witnesses.\n4. Witnesses cited by the\nprosecution cannot be\ncalled by the defence, in\nsome cases witnesses have\nbeen cited for prosecution\nand not been called to\ngive evidence.\n6. The prosecutors refuse\n.o comment on or give\nreasons for its decisions.\n7. The prosecution have\ntwice had to either radically change or amend\ncharges. The Disciplinary\nCommittee deemed that\nall the charges were in-competent, \"this in competency related purely to\nquestions of procedure'. In\na court of law this would\ninvalidate all charges.\n8. At one point a prosecution witness indicated\nthe defence lawyer as\nbeing present at the dem-on st ration, he mistook him\nfor the student he was\nsupposed to implicate.\n9. The court has laid the\nburden of proof onto the\naccused, to show their\ninnocence, rather than the\nway a court of law supposedly operates.\nThe prosecuting counsel\nadmitted in court that\nnone of the charges would\neven be considered relevant in a court of law.\nThe Charges\nFourteen members of\nthe student council were\naccused with having taken\npart in a meeting which\ndecided to demonstrate on\nthe day of the Queen's visit and that they failed\nto keep order at the meeting that occurred. The president was accused of\nplaying a prominent part\nin the demonstration and\noccupation of the library.\nMost of the other charges related to 'drunk\nand disorderly' behaviour.\nThe Cases So Far Five students were charged with gaining unauthorised entry to a reception held for the Queen.\nFour were found guilty.\nOne female student,\ncharged with drunk and\ndisorderly was found guilty on the evidence of\na photograph showing her\nin a large crowd.\nThe famous student\nphotographed drinking from a bottle, was charged\nwith drinking from a bottle . . . in the presence\nof the Queen. He was\nfound not guilty, because\nthe Queen sent a letter saying she did not find his\naction discourteous.\nThe prejudiced nature\nof the courts, and the type\nof charges, especially the\none which the president of\nthe students association\nwas faced with, clearly indicate an attack on the\nautonomy of student affairs, and an attack particularly on sabbatical officers; in that the charge\ncould not be made to stick\non any other students.\nIC union policy is to\nsupport any students-faced with victim is ation of\nstudent at Stirling and has\nalready sent some money\nto their defence fund.\nFelix will keep you informed of events.\nALF PERRY\nDEB ISH UP fi/ts icI will admit that I had\nalways thought of Dr.\nMichael Ramsey( the\n' Archbishop of Canterbury' to his friends) as\na kind of spiritual heavy-artillery. But when I went along to hear him in General Studies on\nThursday last there was\na vigour and cheerfulness in his manner that\nwere as refreshing as\nthey were enlightening.\nThe questions asked covered a wide area,\nfrom ' Do you believe in\nthe Pope's Infallibility?\" to \" What are your views on Allegro's 'The Sacred Mushroom'?\" and most\nimportant, the direct\nquestions of faith \" Why should I be a Christian?\" \u2014 No, the Pope is not in-fallible, well, I haven't studied 'The Sacred Mushroom', but most\nscholars who have agree\nthat it is bogus, and you should be a Christian because you want to be, let\nme tell you why Iam. These were the genuine\nsort of answers that the\nArchbishop gave \u2014 and, even if you disagreed with their content, their\nhonesty was utterly admirable. To summarise the\nquestions is impossible( my short-hand's a bit\nlimited) but the man's views on abstracts like\n'The Day of Judgment',' Evil' and 'The Devil' were closely - thought\nand remarkably acceptable to the packed audience. The applause was long and loud, and well deserved.\nDAVID GURNEY "

No. 328\nUNION MEETING\nThursday\n\u2022 r \u2014\n200 march to DES\nLast week, I.C.s very own demo finally got under\nway. About200 people assembled on the steps in\nfront of Me chEng on Wednesday and, just after half\npast one, they formed up behind the I.C. banner to set\noff. The in arch started with a tour of the college along\nImperial Institute road and up Queensgate where Bo took over the lead, it stopped off at the Un on to pick\nup further recruits, and then proceeded to Souih Kensington station to catch the tube to the Temple.\nby exactly why the demonstration was taking place. There was a complete ab The column reformed outside the station and was joined by a contingent from Thames Polytechnic. After as light delay, the march again set off. The police, whose numbers had risen considerably since the start of the march, were now very much in evidence. There was a control van heading the march and completely usurping Bo's position. As well as the foot patrols containing the marchers, two motorcyclists to clear the road ahead and two bus loads of Police behind( almost more Police than demonstrators, in fact). Interestingly, there was another march just after the EC. one and the Police made sure that there was no chance of the two marches joining together. The route taken went along the South of The Aldwych, over Waterloo Bridge, round the roundabout and along the York Road to the Department of Education and Science building, just beside Waterloo station. The march was accompanied by continuous chanting of slogans such as ' Higher grants today, the DES must pay' and' Higher grants in, wage freeze out' and, all along the route, leaflets were handed out and attempts were made to explain to passers-sence of ugly incidents and, on the whole, the members of the public who were approached seemed sym pa the tic. In particular, Trevor Phillips was very well received when he handed leaflets to motorists going northwards across the bridge as we were going south; ex-ce pt in one case where a gentleman in a Rolls Royce refused to accept the offer-in g.At the DES, the marchers formed into a crowd on the pavement opposite the building while the sack of letters was taken from Bo and a deputation was assembled to\npresent them. They were then taken into the DES and handed by Paul Jo witt, leader of the deputation, to\nMichael Smith, Private Secr et ary, who accepted them on behalf of the UnderSecretary of State.\nAfter the presentation, John Lane explained to the crowd what would be done with the letters and then introduced further speakers, Malcolm Madden from Mar jons, Judy Cotter President of U LIES A and Ray Dawson a chemistry PG, who' all spoke on various aspects of the grants campaign.

    "content": "February 13th,1973 FELIX Page 3\nFEEIX FINANCIA\u00a3\u00a3Y What was that about\nfour new halls\nof Residence?\nby Derek E. Cummings\nYes, it was a long time ago.\nIt was last year, just before Christmas, when I wrote\nan article suggesting how Imperial College could get\nitself four new Halls of Residence and thereby ease\nits accommodation problem.\nI suggested, you may remember, that there was land\navailable held by the Greater London Council, and\nthat there was money available held by the banks. And that what was needed was a concerted effort by all concerned to bring the two together. I make no excuses\nfor bringing the subject up again. As a matter of fact,\nIam delivering a General Studies lecture on precisely\nthat, next Tuesday, February 20. I would like you to\ncome and hear me, because Iam interested in the\nreactions of everyone involved.\nAnd, surely, you are involved?\nBEEHIVES?\nOne student who thought he was involved was John\nPorter. He wrote a letter to the editor of Felix and it\nwas published in the January 8 issue.\nI'd like to commend John Porter for his interest. He wasn't entirely in agreement with what I had written\nbut his letter did raise a number of points which I would like to take up.\nIn the first place, he questioned whether students\nreally need to be housed in little cubes stacked on top\nof one another and suggested that what they really\nneed is a home instead of a unit of accommodation.\nWell, that's a humanitarian view, I agree. By implication it makes a hall of residence sound like a latter-day workhouse. But apart from the fact that almost\nany living space can be defined in terms of cubes\u2014\nsimply because we live in a three-dimensional world \u2014\nI simply do not agree that a hall of residence has to\nbe no more than a series of cells. What I do say is that\nvertical building is economic and that if there is not\nthe cash about to provide every student with a country\ncottage, the idea of a well designed apartment block is\nthe best compromise.\nAnd in any case, isn'ta hall of residence, properly\ndesigned with facilities the student needs \u2014 such as\nshops, a hank, a launder et te, and, of course, a good bar\n\u2014isn't that preferable to some of the over-priced, undersized private flats that many students live in now?\nJohn Porter also draws the parallel with Surrey University at Guildford, and the kind of village community\nthey have built there.\nIt so happens that I live near Guildford and I have\nvisited the campus at Surrey many times, and I have\ntalked to just as many students there who dislike the\ndesign of their accommodation as do like it.\nI suppose it goes to prove that you can't please all the people all the time and that perhaps there is no\nperfect answer to the problem. I don't for a moment\nhold my project to be the perfect solution. What I do\nsay about it is that it is the most obvious one.\nAnd there is really very little point in engaging in that kind of polemic just now. There are four thousand\nstudents at I.C. and I have no doubt that every one\nof them could put forward a blueprint for the ideal\ntype of accommodation and every one would be\ndifferent.\nDerek E. Curnmsngs' lecture next\nTuesday will be of importance to us\nall \u2014 and certainly should be of inter-est. Whether or not you agree with\nhis solution to the accommodation\nproblem, he's prepared to stand up\nand say it again. It's YOUR opportunity\nto get into the argument and perhaps\nto make a point. After alt, this is our\nconcern. Even if you are among those\nwho think that halls of residence can\nbe built by willpower alone, or believe\nthat the accommodation problem can\nbe solved by waving a wand, come to\nthe General Studies lecture and say so.\nWhat is really important is the need for some kind\nof accommodation and the will to find an answer to\nthat need.\nFIND IN iI f11All right, it is going to cost money. There simply are\nnot enough Wolfsons and Gulbenkians around to grant\nall the cash necessary, even if there is the inclination.\nAnd if we all sat back and waited for some government to answer all the problems, 1 should think we'll\nbe sitting in the cold for a long time to come. And this\nis where wc come to the crux of John Porter's letter. He is fairly scathing about the plan I put forward to borrow the money from the banks and couples his argument with some mathematics to demonstrate how expensive it is all going to be.\nWell now, there are a couple of points I'd like to\nmake in reply. First, the bank is where the money is.\nIf there is going to be any accommodation at all, the\nplan will have to be submitted to whoever has the\nmoney to translate it into bricks and mortar. And at\nthe moment, that looks like the bank. Of course, if\nthe majority of you feel that borrowing money from\nthe bank is contrary to your principles, I 'll forget the\nwhole thing. Assuming, of course, that no-one has a bank overdraft or is buying anything on hire purchase\n. . . Second, it was a bit tough of John Porter to hit me\nwith figures. After all, we are really talking about\npossibilities \u2014 practical ones, nonetheless \u2014 and Iam not prepared to argue pounds and pence until.we have\nsomething more concrete to discuss.\nIT CAN BE DONE!\nYou see, what Iam driving at is this. The project\n1 have in mind is a likely answer to the student accommodation dilemma. Iam quite willing to stick my neck\nout and go and ask for the land and the money and\nall the rest, but what I have to know is that you are\nbehind the idea, as an idea. I could fill the whole of\nFelix and talk all next Tuesday about it, but it isn't worth a damn unless you give it your support.\nBut before I have the last word, I'd like to take up\nthe final point in John Porter's letter. He mentions a successful rent strike at Sussex, which resulted in the\nauthorities there scrapping a project to build halls of\nresidence and in their place, agreeing to some other\nform of housing.\nSurely the point here is that the university was ready\nto start building\u2014something. Whether it was a tower\nblock or amine shaft makes little difference to our\ntheme. The money was there: the argument was about\nhow it should be spent.\nWe are in a wholly different ball game. The problem\nwith I.C. is to find the money and to find the land. I only suggest that we all put our minds to that problem\nfirst and argue about exactly what to make of them\nafterwards.\nI pointed out in my original article that 1 v/o ul d be\nperfectly prepared to assist any group which feels\nstrongly enough about this thing to try for a solution.\nThat offer still stands and I shall repeat it at my General Studies lecture next week.\nI also said that nothing at all would happen unless\nyou, the students, wanted it to happen and got up off\nyour seats and made it happen.\nThat remains true, and I shall repeat that at my lec-ture, too. Which is why I commend John Porter. He didn't go along with the views I'd expressed, and he\nsaid so and he said why.\nAnd if John Porter represents the majority feeling\namong you all, well, there's nothing much for me to\ndo but drop the whole idea. But before I did that, I'd want to make quite sure that you all knew what I have\nbeen talking about.\nI have been \u2014 Iam \u2014 talking about an opportunity\nto create four new halls of residence for Imperial College. I'm talking about getting the land and getting\nthe money. I'm talking about a chance you have to\ncreate something for yourselves and for future students.\nFin talking about you.\nAnd \u2014 forgive me if I'm wrong \u2014 I don't think I 've\nheard too much of that kind of talk recently.\nCOMMUNITY ACTION NEWS\nAPPEALS GROUP Anyone interested in\nforming an 'appeals\ngroup' to represent\nclaimants on tribunals,\nthat is, to fight supplementary pensions claims, especially discretionary heating allow-ances, for elderly people?

    "content": "Page 8 FELIX February 13th,1973 the sports pag^5\nLast Saturday the 1st XI got back to serious business with a league match against the league leaders,\nSilver Wing. It turned out to be a hard match which\nSilver Wing just managed to win 1\u20140 with a disputed\ngoal.\nThe game got off in a good fashion when straight from\nthe bully Silver Wing broke through and hit the post\nwithout an I.C. player touching the ball. Most of the\naction then seemed to be centred in I.C.'s circle, but\nSilver Wing were unable to score as Sid Boulton was\nhaving one of his better games in goal.\nDuring one of I.C.'s bursts of pressure in the first\nhalf the ball did actually find the Silver Wing net but\nMick Downs was, rather harshly, blown up for sticks.\nThe second half continued in much the same way with plenty of action in both circles. However, tempers\nbecame a bit frayed and a few people squared up to\neach other after silly little fouls.\nWith only ten minutes of the match remaining Silver\nWing were awarded their goal. Following a break on the right, their centre-forward broke free into the circle\n\u2014 helped by what seemed to be a foot \u2014 and, on the\nchallenge of the goalkeeper, pushed the ball into the\nnet with his back-stick.\nOverall it was a fair performance only marred by\nsome of the decisions that Ron Palmer gave in the\nsecond half, when \u2014 in his own words \u2014 it became\nto dark to follow a dirty ball.\nTeam: S. Boulton; R. Cameron, D. Browne; B. Evans, T. Hanson, G. Popple; A. Tatchell, M. Downs,\nD. Richman, J. Astley, C. Dyer.\nOn another pitch a few yards away a full-strength\n2nd XI entertained a weakened U. C.M.2 nd XI to a5 \u20140 thrashing. After much argument I.C. gave U. C.M.a player \u2014 the Old Age Pensioner \u2014 to strengthen\ntheir left wing.\nI.C. scored three goals in the first half through Alan Brown, Dave Neal and Tim Feline. Dave Neal then\nadded two more in the second half, but \"forgot\" to buy\nhis jug. There would have been many more goals but\nfor I.C.'s inability to hit the ball accurately towards the\ngoal.\nThe O. A.P. playing for U.C. M.on the L.W. had an enjoyable time watching the first team game and in the\nbar afterwards, missed an open goal in the first half\nand, to everyone's amusement, missed a penalty flick in\nthe second.\nTeam: P. Brooks; I. Boyd, P. Foxton; D. Agnes,\nA. Brown, S. Bottom; D. West, I. Read, D. Neal( 'Scrooge'), T. Feline.\nOn Wednesday the first eleven visited a much-changed\nSilver Wing and gained revenge by coming away with\na4 \u20142 win. The goals came from Mick Downs, and\nthree from Mark Tatchell, one helped in by a defender.\nAfter last week's report, it seems that some people\ndo not know the special relationship that Mick Downs\nhas with his favourite drink, Heineken. Well, towards\nthe end of last season a few of the P.A.'s gather for a celebration piss-up. After the bars had closed, this\nadjourned with a couple of crates of Newky and Heineken, to 326 Falmouth. As there were a few party\ngames going on, the Newky quickly disappeared; so the\nparticipants were then required to drink Heineken. Now Mick Downs, whose timing was slightly out on this\nevening, took one sip of Heineken and immediately left\nto have a liquid laugh on the landing outside. For those\nwho are interested that famous bottle is still on show\nin 326 Falmouth.\nMIXED HOCKEY Last Sunday the I.C. mixed XI continued on their\nvictorious path when they defeated Q.E. C.2 \u20141. Unfortunately both teams had difficulty in raising full sides.\nThe I.C. centre-half failed to turn up (pissed again,\nAlan), so they unleashed their secret weapon\u2014Godfrey\nEverett (who's he?). Q.E. C. were two girls short (\"They\nhaven't recovered from last night!\"), so Ann Purvis was\nvolunteered (a sick joke) to play for Q.E. C., and turned\nout to be their star player, until clobbered by the I.C. captain \u2014 their only playing O. A.P. After an initial burst of Q.E. C. pressure, I.C. began\nto play their normal devastating brand of hockey, i.e. Wonder Boy brilliantly creating open goals but then\nmaking a right cock-up of it. I.C. scored in each half\n\u2014 the first from aW.B. short corner, the second from\nPoacher Everett. Q.E. C.'s goal came later in the match\nfollowing an individual run by their right-half.\nThe memorable points were: Poacher Everett's mystifying display of hockey skills, once he had stopped\nplaying with the female full back; W.B.' s shooting; and\nJohn Astley's outstanding performance at centre-half.\nTeam: R. Cameron; Julie Andrews (O. A.P:),G. Popple; Jacqui Buzzard, J. Astley, Chris Brown; Blossom,\nW.B., Janet Manfield, Poacher Everett.\nmotor cyclists unite!\nThe motor cycle section is alive and well and living\nin a hole under Exhibition Road pavement. Our H.Q.( hindquarters?) is under the aforesaid pavement in front\nof Me ch. Eng. building, access via the steps to the\nlawn. We had a very interesting and enjoyable motorcycle film show earlier this term as all of you who\nwere there (12)! will know. Our next meeting is in the\nhole this Wednesday, i.e. the 14th( which is St. Valentine's Day). So come along and show how much you\nlove your bike any time after 2 p.m. Future activities include a\" Burn to Brighton\" on Saturday, March10 th( leave Mech. Eng. concourse 10\na.m.).

Eng. letter rack or Weeks 36.\nBRUCE CROSS Motor sport\nSunday, the 28th January, saw a large entry of 29\ndrivers for C&G Motor Club's first big event, a \"Pro-duct ion Car Trial\". The thirteen tests which made up\nthe trial consisted of a variety of mud or gravel hills\nand four speed tests. The speed tests were also fairly\nvaried, containing an \"auto test\" type test, a hill climb\nthrough a wood and a spectacular water splash.\nDespite the complete lack of experience of our dr i vers, some of them put in some very respectable per-form ances, even when compared with the four \"experts\"\nfrom the Cem'ian Motor Club. Tony Raine (Mech.\nEng. 1), put in a sparkling performance in the Range\nRover and succeeded in collecting no penalty points\nwhatsoever. Needless to say Tony took the prize for\nthe Specials Class. Mike Mason (Mining), put in an incredible performance in his first competitive event and\ndespite the handicap of driving a strange car (Malcolm\nNewman's1100), took first place overall. Mike collected\na total of only twelve penalty points and so becomes\nthe first winner of the \" Turn ball Trophy\".\nHot on Mike's heels came the four Cemian, entries.\nRon Whalley (Ford 100E) taking second place overall,\na mere one per cent behind Mike. Taking sixth place\noverall and the second best club member was Malcolm Newman (1100), whose performance was only spoilt by\na poor time through the water. Rob Armitage (Renault)\ncame in seventh overall and class winner (his car was\nthe only one in its class). Mention should also be made\nof Perry (mind that tree!) Newton in 8th place (dented\nEscort GT), and a surprising 10th place for Pete Cram b driving a vast ten foot wide Cortina Mk3 Estate, which\nsomehow avoided trees which the large cars such as\nEscorts hit.\nDespite the lack of time to complete all the tests\neveryone had a great deal of fun (except the trees). By next year the organisers hope to have developed inflatable plastic trees for the benefit of Escorts and also\nthey hope to discover a hill too steep for a Range Rover.\nMany thanks to everyone who marshalled.\nJIM BRIGGS cross country\nWHERE HAVE ALL THE RUNNERS GONE? First the good news: Rob Parker's legs really are the\nsame length ! And now the bad news: The results \u2014\nBereft of our beloved captain and many others through\nvarious injuries and excuses (such as pins and needles\nbrought on by hard training), our team has been somewhat under-strength throughout the term.\nWe didn't mind running or rather squelching the\nQ.M. C.1\\ but cramp on s would have been appreciated\nto get out of the odd drainage ditch! Fine performances\nby P. Clarke, D. Payne and S. Webb helped the team to\nfinish in 11th position (out of 12).\nA very injury depleted team performed well in the\n3rd league race at Surrey Univ. \" Granny\" Clarke and\nRob Allinson did well in coming 24th and 36th respectively. Perhaps we were spurred on by having to pass no\nfewer than three injured club officials six times during\nthe race (Rod Parker, captain, Hugh Culverhouse, sec,\nJim Bathrust, tre as.). The less said about the U.C.5 the better, so I won't say anything. The next bit comes courtesy of an anonymous U. C.P.A. and was found on the X Country\nNotice Board: UC vs. I.C.31/1/73.U. C. \"Superstars\" had yet another totally boring race\nv the I.C. Magical Mystery team.\nU.C., fielding a very weakened team in sympathy\nwith I.C.'s total lack of athletic talent, displayed once\nagain (boring!!) the qualities that make them worthy\nLondon champions.\nHowever, I.C. put up a very spirited show in the face\nof inevitable defeat, managing to clock in the last five\ncounters in personal best times. Rob Parker was heard\nto say, \" I knew our lads had it in them\".\nI conclude this objective, unbiased report of \" The Richmond Massacre\" (oops! what a give-away), by\nsending our deepest sympathies to Peg-leg Parker, the\nMaster Marker and his Flower People.\nSigned AN ON The bit about the personal bests was not quite cor-rect, P. Clarke took his down to 29 : 56, D. Payne\nknocked his down (yet again!) to 31 : 41, and Pete Johnson is now down to ?????\nA team supplemented by guests in the form of B. Dabrowski and R. Palmer (U.C. reject would you be-li eve) came, a close second in a three cornered match\nat Coulsden against a strong South London Harriers\nand a pathetic, even by our standards, London Postal\nRegion team. The guests did well, Barry Dabrowski\n.was 2nd in31:02, the U.C. person was 8th, Paul Clarke\nwas 4th in 32:25, followed by Rob Allinson 10th, Dave\nPa\ny ne11 th, Dave Jones 17th, and bringing up the rear\nin 42 : 23, the star of the team, Pad Donnelly. Pad says\nthis performance was due not to his getting lost (for a change) but to an excess of Cold Germs and Guinness.\nAlso seen running this term were : R. Maddison,\nKaliray, S. Littlewood, I. Isherwood and Neil Whatsisname. D.J. P.,A.P.A. JOHN LANE\nSHOWDOWN AT BRIAN T'S! Last term the Union passed a resolution of support for the work in at Brian t Colour Printing in SE London. Brian t's was closed seven months ago. Since then the workers have been keeping the plant running with a view to getting a buyer to takeover the whole company as a going concern. They are at present negotiating with a potential buyer. The liquidator, however, prefers assets tripping. If he has his way the workforce will be broken up, the machinery sold and the sites old in a nice, profitable property deal. To this effect he has issued writs through the High Courts to evict the work in,to gain possession of documents and for costs and damages. The work in committee face imprisonment. This they are prepared to do rather than sellout the workers whose jobs they are fighting for. We must put our resolution into action by responding to their call for support. Firstly, they are organizing a mass picket outside Brian t's from12.00 today... when the writ expires. Any I.C. student who can go should meet at11.00 in the Union Office.\nSecondly, a rota of college supporting the work-i'n has been organised to man the picket line for the rest\nof the week. ICh as been asked by the Brian t's committee to turnout for Wednesday from12.00 onwards. The Brian t's workers are fighting for\" The Right to Work\", a fundamental right which the law is now threatening to deny them. Their fight has been far from selfish \u2014 their printing facilities have constan ly been made available for other working class struggles \u2014 the five jailed docker s, the UC S work in, etc. It is now time for their supporters to rally to their defence. INFLATION \u2014 DEPRESSION I hope there isn't anyone left who does not know that NUS submitted a claim for a \u00a3 6 5 increase last September. This was in fact the decline in purchasing power of the\" outside London\" grant since the last review in1971. The claim for London was for \u00a3 8 0 .\nSince the Government is unlikely to pay up until the beginning of next session the claim has had to be revised to allow for inflation this year. The new\" outside London\" demand will be about \u00a3 1 0 5\nand hence IC students will need a staggering \u00a3 1 3 0\njust to catchup with the standard of living that some of us old timers had back in the golden age,1971. Just in case anyone thinks there is a price price freeze on, the Refectory Manager, Victor J. Mooney, Esq., has told the Refectories Committee that increase in food costs between September and February were enough to justify a25 percent increase in prices. We're getting squeezed \u2014 it's about time we fought back! REFECTORY BOYCOTTS This week the campaign of refectory boycotts gets off the ground. Firstly it highlights the fact that the grant is too low for many students to afford to eat three meals a day. Secondly, it should lead to much stronger pressure for a grants increase from the College.
