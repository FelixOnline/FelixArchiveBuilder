    "content": "Ramadan Reflections\nA series of reflections from Imperial students on experiencing this Ramadan\nLIBERATION\nAmbreen\nB\nelow are some\npersonal reflections submitted\non Ramadan,\nthe holy month in which\nMuslims fast from dawn\nto sunset in order to gain\nconsciousness of God\nin all their actions. We\nhope this article can show\nthat, whilst Ramadan is a\nprescribed month, we all\nexperience it in our own\npersonal ways!\nAmbreen\nmarathon comes to an end,\nwe try to maintain what\nwe practised in Ramadhan\nfor the rest of the year.\nThe aim being that each\nRamadhan is better than\nthe last as we strive to\nwork on ourselves as\nMuslims and as students\nat university.\nMost importantly,\nRamadhan is a month to\nreflect on my relationship\nwithAllah(God).Religion\nis ever fluctuating; there\nwill be times when you\nfeel invincible in your\nreligion and others when\nit can waver. This month\nis often a time of spiritual\nhigh for many, as communities come together\nfor late night prayers and\niftaar (breaking the fast\nat sunset). This spiritual\nhigh encourages me to\nincrease in the number of\ngood deeds I do, whether\nit be helping the homeless\nor giving charity. The aim\nis for these good deeds to\nbe continued throughout\nthe rest of the year to help\nme improve my character,\nnot just to deprive myself\nof food and drink for a\nmonth.\nHind M Arekat\nMercy is attributed\nGod in many ways. This\nacts as a reminder for\nMuslims: no matter how\nmuch we mess up, neglect\nour religion or get caught\nup in our daily life, God is\nalways waiting to forgive\nus and bestow His mercy\nupon us. Ramadan is a\nspecial time of year for\nus. It\u2019s the time of year\nwhen one is encouraged to\nstart over and turn a new\npage. It\u2019s an opportunity\nto engage in the worship\nof God, not only to follow\nthe rules of the religion,\nbut to understand its very\nessence.\nIt\u2019s the time of year\nto re-charge one\u2019s body,\nmind, heart and soul. The\nbody is re-charged by\nteaching it self-control.\nWhen fasting from food\nand water, they are no\nlonger priorities, and so\nour bodies become more\ndisciplined. The mind\nis re-charged when we\nread the Qur\u2019an, attempt\nto learn it and apply its\nwisdom to our daily life.\nAs Muslim students,\nwe are taught to value\nknowledge. During this\nholy month, studying\nand keeping up with\nthe workload can prove\nchallenging, but nevertheless striving to gain that\nknowledge at this valuable\ntime would make the difficulties worth it. The heart\nis re-charged by becoming\nmore compassionate; we\nare taught to be grateful\nfor the blessings we have,\nconsequently motivating\nus to do and spread good\nthrough the simplest acts\nof charity. At this blessed\ntime our community of\nbrothers and sisters come\ntogether, flourishing with\nlove and hope. The soul\nis re-charged when we\nengage in prayers with\nthe most genuine of inten-tions, knowing that The\nAll-Hearer, All-Seeing,\nAll-Knowing, is waiting\nto grant us peace, patience\nand guidance.\nRamadan is the perfect\ntime to strive to be the\nbest person you could be,\nbuild up good habits and\nkeep them up after the\nholy month has passed.\nIt\u2019s the perfect time\nNightly prayers and free food for Imperial staff and students every night on campus // A\u2019yunie Anwar\nLIBERATION\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nMAY, 2019 FELIX\n12\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nfor soul searching, doing\ngood and seeking spiritual\nfulfilment.\nIt\u2019s the perfect time to\nfind purpose in everything\nyou do.\nTo me, Ramadan is a\nmonth of giving back.\nKhadija Mahmoud\nFor eleven months of\nthe year we live in Allah\u2019s\nblessing; our health, our\nfamily, our success and\neven our failures, whereby\nwe are given the ability to\nmove past them and, in\ndoing so, only strengthen\nour resolve. For another\nmonth we\u2019re given so\nmany chances to give\nback as we seek to purify\nour bodies and souls and\nacquire piety. Ramadan.\nThe month where rewards\nare multiplied; a perfect\ntime to give back, not\njust through serving\nAllah as we spend nights\nstanding in prayer but in\nserving His creation and,\nin doing so, Him. Those\nnights where His doors\nof mercy are wide open,\ncalling to His believers to\napproach with their good\ndeeds. Those nights serve\nas an opportunity to thank\nHim for what we have.\nAs He says in the Quran:\n\u201cIf you are grateful, I will\nsurely increase you in\nfavour.\u201d For me, this is an\nincredibly special verse as\nit reminds me of His gen-erosity. If we just spend\nsome time thanking Him\nfor what He has blessed us\nwith, then He is so pleased\nwith our efforts that He\nnot only maintains but\nincreases our blessings.\nHowever, our chance\nto give back doesn\u2019t\njust stop there. As the\nProphet Muhammad\nsaid: \u201cWhoever relieves\na believer\u2019s distress of the\ndistressful aspects of this\nworld, Allah will rescue\nhim from a difficulty\nof the difficulties of the\nHereafter.\u201d Relieving the\ndistress of others isn\u2019t\njust limited to paying\nfor a family\u2019s iftaar in\na developing country,\ngiving back can start\nmuch closer to home. We\ncan be rewarded in every\npart of our day; the simple\nacts of kindness that can\nmake other people\u2019s day.\nMuhammed\nHind M Arekat\nKhadijah Mahmoud\nAminah Ali\nSharmin Akbar\nIslamic Society\nMuhammed\nRamadhan is often well\nknown as the Islamic holy\nmonth when Muslims\naround the world give up\nfood and drink. For me,\nRamadhan is more than\njust having a growling\nstomach and parched\nmouth, it\u2019s a time of reflection on the year just gone\nand planning for the year\nahead. The way in which\nwe control our hunger and\nthirst is similar to the way\nin which we are advised to\ncontrol our thoughts, what\nwe say and how we act.\nFor me, Ramadhan\nis like training for a\nmarathon; it is the month\nof improvement in your\ncharacter, in how you\ntreat people, the amount\nof charity that you give\nand your own relationship\nwith God. As Ramadhan\ncomes to an end, just\nas your training for a\n\u201cIt is the\nmonth of\nimprovement\nin your\ncharacter, in\nhow you treat\npeople, the\namount of\ncharity that\nyou give and\nyour own\nrelationship\nwith God\u201d\nLIBERATION\nFRIDAY, 29TH\nSEPTEMBER, 2017 FELIX\n13\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nEven a smile, which the\nProphet teaches us is itself\na charity.\nThus, by serving\nAllah\u2019s creation, we are\nnot only serving and\npleasing Him but also\nserving ourselves as Allah\npromises us reward. I\nguess my point here is\nthat giving back is really\na chance to help yourself\ntoo in showing gratitude.\nThis Ramadan, I find\nmyself eager to go that\nextra step to help those\naround me, knowing that,\nwith every good deed,\nAllah will only increase\nwhat I am already blessed\nwith in this holy month\nand the eleven others.\nAminah Ali\nRamadan completely\nchanges my life for one\nmonth every year, but I\nlove it! It\u2019s a chance to\nincrease my faith, fix my\nbad habits and remind\nmyself of my duty to help\nthe poor and needy whose\neveryday reality consists\nof feeling hungry and\nthirsty.\nAs part of my dissertation this year, I explored\nintermittent fasting and\nits beneficial effects on\nageing and disease. I was\namazed by what I read.\nAlthough I was aware that\nfasting was good for my\nsoul, I was not so knowledgeable about how good\nit was for my body!\nI\u2019ve been fasting since\nI was 11 and always knew\nit was a good thing to do\nspiritually. However, after\ndiscovering the many\nhealth benefits, I felt like\nI could now completely\nappreciate why it is one of\nthe five pillars of Islam.\nFasting has been practised for both religious\nand medical purposes for\nthousands of years and I\nthink it\u2019s amazing that researchers are discovering\nthe effects of fasting on\nageing and ageing-associ-ated disorders.\nSharmin Akbar\nYour mum coming in\nand waking you up before\ndawn, sleepily walking to\nthe dining table to gobble\ndown whatever food is put\nin front of you, while your\nmother is walking around\nmaking sure that everyone\nis eating and drinking\nenough.\nFor many young people\nthis is how mornings in\nRamadan, the 9th\nmonth of\nthe Islamic calendar, and\nthe month of fasting, look.\nRamadan is a spiritual\ntime for Muslims. It is\na time for prayers and\nself-reflection. But it is\nalso a time for family. A\ntime of togetherness.\nIn most families,\nwhether you eat together\nthe rest of the year or not,\nduring Ramadan you are\nsure to eat every meal\ntogether. Even when that\nmeal is eaten at 3.00 am.\nPraying and going to the\nmosque together, visiting\nrelatives, having a lot\nof guests over, are just\nsome of the examples\nhow families spend their\nRamadan together.\nThis experience\nlooks different for the\nmany students who live\naway from home during\nRamadan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to increase my faith, fix my bad habits and remind myself of my duty to\nhelp the poor and needy\u201d // A\u2019yunie Anwar\n\u201cReligion is ever fluctuating; there will be times when you feel invincible in your religion and others when it can waver\u201d // A\u2019yunie Anwar\nrelatives or your family\ncan easily make you\nfeel isolated and lonely.\nEspecially when the only\nthing you seem to be\ndoing beside eating and\npraying is studying for\nyour exams.\nNot living with your\nfamily does not mean\nthat you have to miss\nout on the whole family\nexperience. You can still\ndo things that remind you\nof home.\nFor example, since I\nam lucky enough for my\nmother to live relatively\nclose to come around for\na week, she flew over in\nApril to prepare some\nsamosas and other snacks\nfor me so I would not miss\nout. And whenever I am\neating alone I try to video\ncall home.\nIf you are missing\nthe hectic and joy filled\nIftaars with your whole\nfamily: Iftaar at Imperial\nis an amazing alterna-tive. For the past three\nyears, Imperial College\u2019s\nIslamic Society has organised Iftaar for every\nday of Ramadan. It might\nnot be your \u201creal\u201d family,\nbut with all the hugs and\nlaughs, eating and praying\ntogether, you are sure to\nfind a second family.\nThen there is Eid, the\ncelebration at the end\nof Ramadan. For many\n\u201cRamadan is\nthe perfect\ntime to strive\nto be the best\nperson you\ncould be, build\nup good habits\nand keep them\nup after the\nholy month\nhas passed\u201d\n\u201cRamadan is a\nspiritual time\nfor Muslims.\nIt is a time for\nprayers and\nself-reflection.\nBut it is also a\ntime for family.\nA time of\ntogetherness.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are\nmissing the\nhectic and\njoy filled\nIftaars with\nyour whole\nfamily: Iftaar\nat Imperial is\nan amazing\nalternative\u201d\nMuslims it is the highlight of the year. That is\nprobably the day on which\nthe reality of being away\nfrom family strikes the\nmost. The best remedies\nfor the loneliness on Eid is\norganising to go to the Eid\nprayer together with some\nfriends and then treating\nyourself to some amazing\nfood!\nWhether away from\nfamily or at home, I\nwish everyone a blessed\nRamadan!\nBesides missing out\non delicious home-made\nIftaar cooked by mum,\neating alone in your\nroom and not seeing any\n\u201cFor the past\nthree years,\nImperial\nCollege\u2019s\nIslamic Society\nhas organised\nIftaar for\nevery day of\nRamadan\u201d\n\n"

Tomorrow\n(25th\nMay) is Lauren's\nbirthday; she would be\nturning 24 so I wanted\nto take this oppotunity\nto dedicate this Editorial\nto her:\nYoo Lauren, wys?\nAs per, I wanted to start\nthis how I started every\nconversation with you. I\ncan't lie man, I still struggle to talk about you but I\nfelt slightly better after the\nlast letter I wrote to you so\nhere goes. I miss you. It's\nbeen pretty difficult since\nyou passed and I think\nabout you everyday.\nI've been agonising for\nthe last month or so about\nwhat I even wanted to\nsay to be honest. Having\nsaid that, my procrastination is still peak. A\nmonth's planning and\nI'm still here, hours after\nthe print deadline. Let's\nhope the printers allow\nme. Anyway, like your\nmum always tells me, you\nwanted to be remembered,\nnot mourned, so I thought:\nwhat better way to remember you than to reminisce\nabout one of my favourite\nmemories with you?\nTaking it back to 24th\nMarch 2018. I'd just\nfinished my disastrous\nFinal Year Design Project,\na project that can only be\ndescribed as a harrowing\nordeal, the deadline of\nwhich was on 19th\nMarch,\nmy 22nd\nbirthday. After\na five day cycle of sleep,\n2\ndrink, sleep, repeat, Shiji,\nIsaac and I made our way\nover to yours for the carrot\ncake you'd made me to\ncelebrate. After raiding\nyour fridge as per, we\nheaded to the studio, you\njumped on the podcast\nand we spent the afternoon catching jokes about\nKanye West memes. Fast\nforward a couple hours\nand I was getting ready\nto head to my cousin's\nbirthday party. My sister\nhad already flaked, as\nhad Isaac and Shiji, but I\nknew I could count on you\nto back me. You jumped\nin the car, we headed to\nKing's Cross and danced\nthe night away to 90s\nR&B tunes.\nIt's funny because it\nreally doesn't sound like\nthe most eventful of days\nbut, looking back, it's\nmoments like that - you\nfeeding me McDonald's\nchips while I tried not\nto crash, with Bryson\nTiller blaring in the background - which I'll forever\ncherish.\nMuch love my G!\nPHOENIX,\nImperial\u2019s magazine, formerly known as\nIf you are interested in Grime\n& Black British music, we want\nto hear from you!\nWhat does Grime mean to\nyou?\nIf you\u2019re interested, please email Felix@imperial.ac.uk\nreturns...with a twist!\n3\nISSUE 1722\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCould this year's Summer Ball be the last held on campus? // Imperial College Union\nIstheSummerBall\"unsustainable\"?\nNEWS\n(cont.)\nProject Team - Kristie\nKnapp, Helen Bhandari,\nJess Harrison & Claudia\nCaravello - and a suitable\ncompromise seems to\nhave been reached in the\nmajority of cases.\nOne such issue that\nhas been resolved is the\nafterparty, which was\ndescribed by some as\npreviously having a \"very\nbare schedule\", with\nSpotify playlists playing\nin many of the rooms, to\nthe chagrin of many of\nthe student societies per-forming. There will now\nbe DJs performing at the\nafterparty.\nAlthough the dispute\nseems to have been\nresolved in most cases,\nit raises the question of\nwhether the Summer\nBall is sustainable in its\ncurrent format. When\nthis question was put to\nJess, she told Felix: \"No.\nIt's not fair that there are\nparts of that student ticket\nthat go toward paying\nfor the fencing, paying\nfor carpet... instead of\nthat going on an artist\nor more fireworks, more\nfairground rides, which is\nhonestly what we'd rather\nput the money on.\"\nJess described the\nprospect of the Summer\nBall moving from Imperial's South Kensington\ncampus to an external\nvenue as a \"wonderful\nidea\" and revealed that\nserious discussions are\nbeing had about the\npossibility of making this\nchange for future years.\nJess added: \"If it were\nmy decision, I would have\nmoved us already but it's\nall linked in with finance\nand risk... it's slightly\nhigher than me.\"\nAfter making a loss in\nprevious years, this year's\nSummer Ball has seen\nmore pressure to ensure\nthe event breaks even.\nThe additional budget\ncontraints led to many of\nthe changes which caused\ndissatisfaction amongst\nthe CSPs. Explaining this\nto Felix, Jess added: \"The\nticket prices have stayed\nthe same this year but\nsuppliers, who do a lot\nfor us and this event, their\ncosts go up every single\nyear. Carpets, security,\nbar staff, stewards, the\nfireworks, the fairground\nrides, everything goes up\na percentage each year\".\nThe changes to the\nannual Imperial Festivalas reported by Felix, this\nyear sees the introduction\nof the larger \"Great\nExhibition Road Festival\n2019\" - has also posed\na logistical challenge to\nthe Summer Ball Project\nTeam. The festival, which\nis to be held the weekend\nafter Summer Ball, means\nthat the team had to\nreschedule many aspects\nregarding the set-up and\nclearing up of campus\nfollowing the ball.\nLauren Dennis\n\n"

That\u2019s right,\ntoday we\u2019ll be talking\nabout swords, swords and\neven more swords with\nthe fighter that started\nit all, #21 in the roster:\nMarth\nMarth is the central\nprotagonist of the\noriginal Fire Emblem\ngame, Shadow Dragon\nand Blade of Light, first\nreleased in 1990. Now\nconsidered as the mascot\nof his franchise, he made\nhis first appearance in\nthe Smash Bros series\nin Melee, alongside the\nlesser known Roy. Whilst\nhis friend may not have\nalways made the cut,\nMarth appeared in every\nfollowing Smash game\nand is now viewed as the\nsignature swordfighter of\nthe brawl. With a standard\nweight and decent speed,\nhe uses his long blade to\nhack, slash and react to his\nopponent\u2019s moves from a\nreasonably safe distance.\nEven if he is still a\nclose-combat character,\nMarth\u2019s sword gives him\nan incredible range which\nallows him to have an edge\non other melee fighters.\nFurthermore, his sword\nhas a unique property: the\ntip of the blade deals more\ndamage than the hilt. This\nmeans that with every\nnormal, tilt, smash or\naerial attack, you ideally\nwant to hit your opponent\nfrom as far as possible.\nThis allows you to inflict\na large amount of damage\nwhilst at a safe distance.\nMarth\u2019s neutral-air is\nnotably effective and\npowerful if you manage to\nhit this sweet spot.\nMarth\u2019s special moves\ncomplement his kit very\nwell. His neutral-B is\nhis Shield Breaker, a\ncharged shield busting\nstab with great range. His\nup-special is the Dolphin\nSlash, a simple vertical\nrecovery which cuts\nthrough anyone above\nhim. Marth\u2019s down-B is\na crucial part of his kit,\nhis Counter. If you get the\ntiming on point, it blocks\nany incoming attack and\ncounter-strikes with a\nmatching force. Last but\nnot least, the side-special\nDancing Blade is a 4 hit\ncombo with very useful\nversatility, as tilting the\njoystick changes the\nfinishing move. Up will\nmake Marth perform an\nupward slash, throwing\nthe opponent in the air to\nfollow up with an aerial.\nDown, mixes it up with\nmultiple low jabs to have\nan unusual number of\nhits. And holding to the\nside is a great kill move,\nknocking back opponents\nwith a powerful last blow.\nThe key to playing\nMarth is observing,\npositioning and reacting\nto your opponents. His\nunique sword rewards\nyou for keeping your\ndistance and hitting your\nenemies with just the tip\nof the blade. It is hence\ncrucial not to get too close\nand to know the reach of\neach of your attacks to\nmake the best of them.\nTo do so effectively, you\nmust keep a sharp eye on\nyour opponent\u2019s moves\nto punish them with a\nquick slash or Counter\nby swiftly moving in the\ncorrect position once\nthey\u2019ve missed or ideally,\nby predicting them. In\ngeneral, this must be done\nfor every fighter but it is\nparticularly important for\nMarth\u2019s quick and precise\ngame style.\nTo conclude, Marth is\nan extremely powerful\nswordfighter thanks to his\ngreat reach but requires a\nskilled and precise player\nto lead him to victory.\nThis makes Marth one of\nthe hardest characters to\nmaster but brings him to\nhigh tier once you do. So\nif the difficulty doesn\u2019t\nscare you then I suggest\nyou take a stab at him\nand in no time, you\u2019ll\nbe spamming: \u201cI won\u2019t\nlose!\u201d\nGAMES\nMichael Cognet\nGames Writer\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a phase Mom\u201d // Nintendo\n\n"

Based to\na great extent on the letters\nthat the two acclaimed\nnovelists wrote each other\nover twenty years, director\nChanya Button\u2019s film, Vita\nand Virginia, explores the\ncomplex relationship the\ntwo women shared, and\nthe conception of Woolf\u2019s\nseminal novel.\nOstensibly a period\npiece, beginning with\nthe meeting between\nSackville-West (Gemma\nArterton) and Woolf (Eliz-abeth Debicki) in 1922,\nthe Vita and Virginia\nattempts to take a page out\nof Sofia Coppola\u2019s 2006\nbiopic, Marie Antoinette.\nIt is to the beat of synth\nheavy electronica that\nVita and Virginia\u2019s eyes\nmeet across a smoke filled\ndancefloor. Whilst Isobel\nWaller-Bridge\u2019s musical\ninterjections bring\nurgency to the narrative\nand serve to highlight the\nmodernism of thought and\nsensibility amongst the\nthe Bloomsbury Group\nto which both SackvilleWest and Woolf belonged.\nThis is not mirrored by\nthe rest of the film which\nremains resolutely staid.\nIn antithesis to Button\u2019s\n2015 debut, Burn Burn\nBurn, Vita and Virginia\nhas a curiously stilted\nquality, particularly as the\nfirst meeting gives way\nto exposition. This is no\nsmall part to its heavy\nreliance on lifting words\ndirectly from the letters\nthat the two novelists\nwrote each other. \u201cI am\nreduced to a thing that\nwants Virginia\u201d wrote\nSackville-West to Woolf\nin one such exchange. On\nthe page these letters are\nelectrifyingly passionate;\nas dialogue, they become\nheavy, and overwrought,\nlosing something of their\nbrilliance. Eileen Atkins\noriginally developed Vita\nand Virginia as a play, and\nhere, the script adapted by\nAtkins and Button for film\nstill clings to the vestiges\nof the stage.\nDebicki and Arterton\ntake turns to perform the\n\u201cIt is to\nthe beat of\nsynth heavy\nelectronica\nthat Vita and\nVirginia\u2019s eyes\nmeet across a\nsmoke filled\ndancefloor.\u201d\n\u201cThe film\noccupies the\ngrey middle\nground\nbetween a\ncharacter\nstudy, and\na period\nromance\nwithout quite\ncommitting to\nbeing either.\u201d\ntext directly to us, the\nviewer, their faces partially obscured by gauzy,\nsoft-focus camerawork.\nDelivered in this way, the\nletters come across not\nas lovelorn confessionals\nbut as performative mon-ologues. It is easy to see\nhow this would\u2019ve been\nsuccessful in a theatre,\nbut on film, the lack of\nnaturalism serves only to\ncreate distance with the\naudience.\nVita and Virginia hits\nits stride in its latter third\nwhen the two protagonists\ncome together as lovers,\nspending their nights in\nVita\u2019s ancestral home,\nSissinghurst Castle,\nwhich will later form\nthe setting of Orlando.\nTheir brief romance is\ntender, propelled by the\nchemistry between the\nlead actresses who lend\nenormous charisma to\ntheir roles. Arterton is\nwinsomely flirtatious, yet\nretains a chink of coldness\nthat manifests itself later\nin the film. Debicki is\nluminous in a vulnerable\nportrayal of Virginia; rail\nthin, holding her body\nwith awkward tension,\nshe looms over Arterton,\ncapturing a sense of being\nentirely otherworldly.\nWhen the two are apart,\nthe movie flags. The\nsupporting cast includes\na roster of stars including\nthey are given precious\nlittle to do other than push\nVita and Virginia together,\nor endeavour to keep them\napart. We are often told of\nthe scandalous free spirit-edness of the Bloomsbury\nGroup, yet seldom see this\nfor ourselves beyond catty\nexchanges over painting\nsessions and raunchy\ndancing at parties.\nThe undercurrents\nof tension between\nSackville-West\u2019s aristocratic upbringing and\nWoolf\u2019s middle class\nsocialist background\nare left relatively un-explored. Any mention\nof the former\u2019s own,\nwildly successful writing\ncareer quickly falls by\nthe wayside. Perhaps\nmost crucially, the movie\ndoesn\u2019t know quite what\nto do with Woolf\u2019s ailing\nmental health; in lieu\nof nuanced dialogue,\nButton opts for fantastical\nallegory. Long strands of\nivy threaten to overwhelm\nher whenever Virginia\nfeels anxious; during\na panic attack a vast\ncloud of crows plummet\ntowards Virginia\u2019s head as\nshe cowers in the garden.\nThese superficial renderings do not do justice to\nWoolf whose life\u2019s work\nwas an articulation of\nthings hidden beneath the\nsurface.\nVita and Virginia is a\nvisually beautiful film,\nfilled with wide, sweeping\nlandscapes and moodily\nlit interiors shot by\nCarlos De Carvalho, but\nwe are left uncertain of\nButton\u2019s intentions. The\nfilm occupies the grey\nmiddle ground between\na character study, and a\nperiod romance without\nquite committing to\nbeing either. A little more\nirreverence from Button\nwould\u2019ve elevated this\nfrom a run of the mill\nWoolf and Sackville-West\nbiopic to a truly perceptive portrayal of the lives\nof these two remarkable\nwomen.\nVita & Virginia // Thunderbird Releasing\nFILM\nIndria Mallik\nFilm Writer\nDir: Chanya Button.

    "content": "ISSUE 1722\nFELIX\n7\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nA Policy View of Abortion\nThe ethics behind abortion have been debated over and over. Think about it policy-wise\ninstead.\nPOLITICS\nIsabelle Zhang\nComment Writer\nL\nast week, the\nAlabama State\nlegislature approved a bill that\nwould limit a woman\u2019s\naccess to abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy and\nmake it a criminal offence\nfor doctors who provide\nthe service. This measure\nhas been the most drastic move by American\npro-lifers to challenge a\nwoman\u2019s right to choose\nto end her own pregnan-cy; whereas recent bills\npassed by other states to\nrestrict abortion access\nhave included exceptions\nfor pregnancies caused by\nrape and incest,Alabama\u2019s\nhas no such concessions.\nThe Republican lawmakers who authored\nthis bill are well-aware\nof its extremity. Indeed,\nthey are hoping that the\nunconstitutional nature of\ntheir proposal can bring\nthe ethos of abortion back\ninto the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndeliberations.\nThe abortion debate is\nmulti-faceted. Whether\nor not one views abortion\nas morally acceptable\ndoes not always dictate\nwhether they think it\nshould be always legal.\nAnd of course, religious\nbelief, the weighing of a\nmother\u2019s right to bodily\nautonomy against the\nfetus\u2019 right to life, the\nscientific determination\nof when life begins,\nfetal viability are all\nfactors lumped into the\ndiscussion. In America,\nhowever, the public\ndiscourse only revolves\naround and agonises\nover a 1973 landmark\ndecision by the U.S.\nSupreme Court, Roe\nv. Wade, which establishes that a woman\u2019s\ndecision of abortion is\nprotected by her right to\nprivacy. And since this\nruling, there has been\nan unrelenting effort\nby conservatives to try\nand overthrow the legal\nprecedent established\nby Roe. It seems, like\nmost issues in America,\nthis is a little too deeply\nembedded in cultural\nand partisan divides for\nactual policy discussions\naround it to surface and\nbe taken seriously.\nThe anti-abortion\nargument is simple and\nuncomplicated, as its\nbasis is mostly in the\nreligious belief that\nlife begins at conception when God creates\nus in the womb, and\nbecause abortion in\neven the earliest stages\nof pregnancy would\nbe to end that life,\nabortion is effectively\nmurder. The case for\nallowing abortion is\nunderstandably less easy\nto argue for, there isn\u2019t\na straightforward way\nto capture the implied\nbeliefs of what pro-choice is in a similarly\ncohesive manner. My\nperspective, at least, is\nthat pro-choice policies\nimplicitly demand social\ntrust in pregnant women\nto be well-informed of\ntheir options and their\nrespective outcomes,\nand that they do not\nabuse the freedom of\nchoice through irresponsible and reckless\nbehavior.\nNonetheless, believing in pro-choice comes\nhand-in-hand with\ndemanding increased\navailability of sexual ed-ucation, contraceptives,\nand family planning,\nwhich would decrease\nthe rate of unwanted\npregnancies that contribute to a significant\npercentage of abortions.\nBecause fundamen-tally, nobody actually\nbelieves that abortion is\ngood if it is unnecessary.\nAdvocating for women\nto be given this choice\nis not synonymous with\nthe casual disregard\nfor a fetus, nor does it\nrepresent an encouragement for women to\ndisregard contraceptives\nand be careless about\npregnancy, nor a disrespect for one\u2019s religion;\ninstead, it is simply an\nunderstanding that, for\nthe greater good of a\nwoman\u2019s freedom to\nchoose abortion should\nbe an available choice,\nand that other policies\ncan be made to tackle\nthe reasons why one\nmight require abortion\nas an option.\nI\u2019ve mentioned some\nof those policies \u2013 family\nplanning and contraceptives \u2013 and to further\nthis argument let\u2019s say\nwe\u2019ve perfected those\npolicies but, because\naccidents happen, the\nwoman gets pregnant\nanyway. Since women\ncan\u2019t just magically\nun-pregnant themselves\n(which would definitely be preferable over\nabortion), it then makes\nsense that the option of\nabortion is an option\nwomen should have. No\nwoman sees abortion as\nan inherently pleasing,\ndiseased children, so\nthat they don\u2019t see the\ndisability/disease as a\nburden heavy enough to\ndeter them from having\nthe child at all.\nAs for Alabama and\nRoe v. Wade, it currently\nseems unlikely that their\nbill will be brought to\nthe Supreme Court. If\nthey do decide to take on\nthis issue next year (the\nCourt operates on a sort\nof cycle where judicial\norders and opinions are\nreleased around June\nevery year), the outcome\nwill have significant influence over the looming\n2020 elections. Regardless, the most effective\nsolution for either side\nof the American public\nis also the simplest:\nvote.\nThe March for Life protest outside the Supreme Court, January 2019 // The New York Times\nattractive process to\nput themselves through;\nwomen who choose\nabortion do so because\nthey believe it is what\u2019s\nbest when compared\nto the alternatives they\nface: being financially\nunable to support the\nchild, having to raise the\nchild alone, knowledge\nthat the child will be\nborn with physical or\nmental health complica-tions. Restricted access\nto abortion is not at all\na policy that addresses\nthe root of their problem\nthat led them to choose\nabortion. Instead, solutions should improve\nthe ability of the welfare\nstate to support low-in-come or single-parent\nhouseholds in raising\na child, and even more\nsupport for parents\nraising disabled or\n\n"

    "content": "In response to Big Daddy Oil\nAn analysis of Saudi Aramco for decision makers of the 21st century\nSUSTAINABILITY\nArtur Donaldson\nSustainability Editor\n\u201cAccording to\nthe Carbon\nAccountability\nInstitute Saudi\nAramco is\nresponsible\nfor 3.4% of\ncumulative\nglobal\nman-made\ngreenhouse\ngas emissions\nsince 1885 \u201d\nA\nrecent article\nin Felix, \u201cBig\nDaddy Oil\noutearns Apple\nand Google, wants more\u201d,\nreported on records\nseen by the Financial\nTimes which assert that\nthe state-owned oil\ncompany Saudi Aramco\nhas a greater net income\nthan any other company\nworldwide. Since many\nof the graduates of this\nuniversity, and readers of\nFelix, will in the future\nbecome decision makers\nin consultancies and international organizations,\nI urge you to take a perspective appropriate for\nthe 21st\ncentury. Reports\non companies must\ninclude a consideration\nof the reliance on natural\ncapital and environmental\naccountability. Because\nuntil recently, natural\ncapital could be treated\nas infinite, and environmental feedbacks on the\neconomy negligible,\neconomic analyses traditionally ignore these\nfactors. However, in light\nof scientific consensus that\nman-made climate change\nis having ramifications\non both the natural and\nthe man-made worlds\nalready, only by correctly\nquantifying natural capital and environmental\nfeedbacks will financial\nreports be of value in the\n21st century. According to\nthe Carbon Accountability\nInstitute Saudi Aramco is\nresponsible for 3.4% of\ncumulative global manmade greenhouse gas\nemissions since 1885.\nIt is disappointing to\nfind an article in a student\npublication presenting\na favourable analysis of\nan oil corporation while\nneglecting any consideration of environmental and\nsocial values, or the fact\nthat its primary product\nis a finite natural resource\nwith detrimental environmental impacts. These\nfactors will strongly affect\nthe prospects of the oil\nindustry. Rather than\ntalking of diversifying\ntheir portfolio to petrochemicals and renew-ables, investors should\ninstead consider whether\ncompanies plan to cease\noil extraction altogether in\nline with scientific reason.\nIn response to questions\nabout peak oil, the CEO\nof Aramco, Amin Nasser,\nsaid that \u201cfewer and\nfewer of our stakeholders\naccept logic and facts\u201d\nat a meeting of Davos in\nFebruary this year arguing\nthat \u201coil and gas is responsible for much of today\u2019s\neconomic growth, and\nindeed future growth\u201d.\nHowever, the premise\neconomic growth being\nof value to society is put\nrather to question when\nthis economic growth is in\nfact causing loss of human\nlife and the eradication\nhighly populated areas of\nAs is shown in a chart of\nthe top 500 companies\nreproduced below, leaving\naside recent speculation\nabout Saudi Aramco, the\nthree top tech companies:\nApple, Samsung and\nAlphabet all have larger\nnet incomes than Royal\nDutch Shell, BP, Total or\nindeed any oil company.\nSecondly, traditional\nfinancial analysts are\ntoo short-sighted to try\nquantify ecological capital\n(such as oil) and accountability for the environment (such as coral reef\nbleaching and disruption\nof climate systems) as a\nresult of companies\u2019 oper-ations. It will take a great\ndeal of labour in order\nto accurately account\nfor these factors, but it\nthis would be of value to\nsociety, certainly more so\nthan creating short-sight-ed reports. Saudi Aramco\nis the largest extractor of\noil and gas and despite\nputting up a smoke screen\nof small projects such as\ncarbon capture, it has in\nfact increased its emissions and its oil output.\nEven comparing with the\noil industry, the emissions\nof Saudi Aramco are the\nworst of any oil company.\nWhile other oil corporations have ceased to\nincrease their emissions,\nas shown in a figure from\nthe Climate Accountability Institute, year-on-year\nAramco churns out even\nmore into the atmosphere.\nDo we value this? When\na company burns limited\ncapital and produces gross\nincreases in emissions\nto sustain its financial\nincome, it is clearly not\na healthy sign for invest-ment.

The\nexpansion of this exploitative organization is a call\nto arms for students and\nfuture decision makers,\nrather an opportunity to\npractice the same financial reporting that has led\nto loss of natural capital\nand degradation of the\nenvironment. Students\nat world-leading universities such as Imperial\nCollege have the potential\nto create a responsible\neconomic system. This\ncan only occur if we learn\nas students to consider the\nenvironmental perspective every time we make\nan analysis and every\ntime we take a decision.\nWithout understanding\nnatural capital and the\nenvironmental impacts\nof organizations, we will\nvalue the exploitation\nof natural resources for\nshort-term growth and\nwonder what happened\nto our belief in a better\nfuture.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 24TH\nMAY, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nCO2\n& methane emissions \\\\ Climate Accountability Institute\nAlphabet, Apple and Samsung all have larger net incomes than Royal Dutch Sell, BP, Total or indeed any oil\ncompany aside from Aramco // Financial Times\nCumulative emissions of\ntop four oil companies\n1885-2014 // J.

    "content": "AI: More than Worth It\nI\nt has almost been\nseventy years since\nAlan Turing published the hugely\ninfluential paper\n\u2018Computing Machinery\nand Intelligence\u2019 where\nhe first posits the basis of\nwhat we now know as the\nTuring test. In a mere life-time,computershavegone\nfrom purely machines\nof calculation to pock-et-sized marvels capable\nof mirroring sentience\nto an uncanny degree of\nsuccess. Barbican\u2019s new\nexhibition, AI: More\nthan Human, hopes to\ntell the story of humanity\nand computer\u2019s shared\nevolution, setting its bar\nhigh as an \u201cunprecedented\nsurvey of creative and\nscientific developments in\nartificial intelligence\u201d. It\u2019s\nan ambitious pitch given\nthe collective obsession\nwith this subject \u2013 it\nseems that you can\u2019t go\nmore than two weeks\nwithout a new AI-centric\nevent popping up at a\nmuseum, art gallery, or\neven the theatre (usually\nproclaiming in a rather\ntemporally-challenged\nfashion that \u201cthe future\nis here\u201d). Fortunately,\ngiven the Barbican\u2019s past\nsuccesses and its record\nof great exhibitions, I was\nexcited to see if the new\nexhibition would prove\nto be not just \u201cmore than\nhuman\u201d but \u2018more than\nclich\u00e9\u2019.\nThe moment I stepped\ninto the exhibition gallery,\nI realised I was right to\nbe excited. What AI:\nMore than Human gets\nright more than any other\nexhibition I recall going to\nis the sense of scope. The\nemphasis is not bound by\nmodern interpretations\nof computers or artificial\nintelligence but rather\nour attempts at creating a\nthinking being. With that\nangle,theexhibitionopens\nby exploring our curious\nhistory with golems and\nother creatures brought to\nlife. Kode9\u2019s newly commissioned sound installation spits out snippets\nand samples of stories\nabout artificial entities in\nan eerie fashion. In fact,\nthe whole first section,\nThe Dream of AI, has\na slightly chilling buzz\nabout it. Sound permeates\nthe gallery, accentuating\nthe often-grotesque\ndepictions of artificial\nlife forms imagined in\nfilm and projected as a\nsupercut of sci-fi horrors.\nEven Doraemon makes a\nguest appearance in the\nexhibition, reminding us\nthat the dream of AI is\nnot just in the past and\nthat we have a long way\nto go before realising said\ndreams. I was slightly\ndisappointed they went\nwith clips from the more\nrecent 3D-rendered Stand\nby Me Doraemon but it\nsuits its purpose in linking\npast, present, and future\njust fine.\nThe second section,\nMind Machines, is a\nslightly more conventional exploration of\nmodern computing with\nan interactive timeline as\nits backbone. However,\neven in the relatively\nstraightforward set-up,\nthere was great care taken\nto show the new and shed\nlight on the lesser-known.\nGone is the gentlemen\u2019s\nclub narrative of computing history, replaced by\na markedly more diverse\ncast of characters. Even\nchess, the Western thinking-man\u2019s game oddly\nprominent in computer\nlore, was deemphasised in\nfavour of go, chess\u2019s wild\nChinese cousin. Another\nhighlight in this section\nincludes Google PAIR\u2019s\nproject, Waterfall of\nMeaning, where you can\nsubmit words to trickle\ndown the screen, veering\nleft and right depending on\nits association with binary\nconcepts such as good/\nbad and male/female.\nAnna Ridler\u2019s tulip-cen-tred pieces take another\napproach, combining\nhistory, economics, com-puting, and even politics\n(see overleaf). Both these\nprojects remind us of how\nmuch influence humans\nstill have over AI and\nhow far away we are from\ncreating an independently\nthinking machine.\nData Worlds, the third\nas I laid waste to a rural\nEnglish village), or record\nsnippets of sound for AI to\nrender as music. Among\nthese pieces designed\nto inspire a giddying,\nchildish glee, are more\nserious works exploring\nethical issues such as bias,\nconfidentiality, and truth.\nThe final section is\nandroids (to be explored\nfurther in a future issue).\nUnfortunately, with its\nbare, robotic body and\ngenderless, ageless face,\nI could only see the cast\nof the next generation of\nuncanny valley horror\nmovies. Not only do\nsynthetic humans feature\nbut also synthetic insects,\nsuch as Yoichi Ochiai\u2019s\nartificial butterfly and\nThe Synthetic Apiary,\na possible solution for\nthe honeybee population\nproblem.\nThere\u2019s very little to\nfault about AI: More\nthan Human. It\u2019s a rare\ninstance where there\nreally is something for\nevery demographic regardless of age, gender,\nrace, and understanding\nof computer sciences. It\u2019s\na masterclass in retelling a\nworn-out story and giving\na fresh perspective on\nsomething that is already\nso familiar to us. What\u2019s\nmore, I didn\u2019t once see\nthe buzzword \u2018big data\u2019\nthrown around callously\nas the question and\nanswer to everything, and\nthat is perhaps the greatest\ntriumph of all.\nThe Barbican\u2019s new exhibition, AI: More than Human, is a colourful sandbox of AI-related treats with plenty of\nsurprises and none of them unwelcome.\nMyriad (Tulips) by Anna Ridler // Anna Dabrowski\nISSUE 1722\nFELIX\n16\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nSyon Lee\nArts Writer\nWhere?

I like to\nwork with technology,\nbut not just because it is\nthere. I think about what\nit can do and how it can\nadd to what I\u2019m making,\nabout its associations\nand the connotations of\nusing it: how can all of\nthese different things go\nin and help amplify or\nconstruct the message I\u2019m\ninterested in and make it\nconceptually stronger.\nWas technology\nsomething that you\nalways wanted to\nincorporate in your\nartwork?\nI\u2019ve always been\ninterested in using data\nand technology, and\nas machine learning\nbecome more prevalent\nand barriers to using it\ndropped, it became a\nnatural way of exploring\nthis existing interest. My\nbackground is in literature\nand linguistics as well so\nthe other quite nice thing\nis if you look at how\nmachine learning systems\nwork in labelling things, \u2013\ndeciding when a thing is\na thing \u2013 it all just came\ntogether, which is why I\nthink I find it so enjoyable\nto work with. It just naturally all fell together and\nI feel that it has become a\nreally natural way to draw\ntogether lots of different\naspects of my practice.\nAlotofyourresearchis\nfocused on how art is\nperceived or validated\nthrough a scientific\nlens. Could you briefly\ndescribe what \u2018art\u2019\nmeans to yourself?\nThis is a hard question!\nI suppose in short art is\nsomething that has intent\n\u2013 you\u2019re trying to question\nthe world through a\nmedium and a process.\nWhat are your major\ninfluences for your\nwork?\nI think my background\nin literature \u2013 I\u2019m constantly reading fiction\n\u2013 has given me a really\ngood grasp on narrative\nand trying to tell a story.\nAlso the type of books\nthat I like to read tend\nto be about quite minor\nthings that still reflect\nmajor issues and I think\nthis reflects back in my\nwork. I also read a lot of\nrandom science facts as I\nfind these to be really inspiring to give new ideas\nand directions.\nI\u2019m really excited to\nsee Mosaic Virus\nand Myriad (Tulips)\nat the Barbican in\nperson. What is the\nsignificance of tulips\nfor you?\nMosaic Virus draws historical parallels from the\n\u2018tulip-mania\u2019 that swept\nacross the Netherlands in\nthe 1630s and the speculation currently ongoing\naround crypto-currencies.\n\u201cMosaic\u201d is the name of\nthe virus that causes the\nstripes in a petal which\nincreased their desirability and helped cause the\nspeculative prices during\nthe time. In this piece,\nthe stripes depend on the\nvalue of bitcoin, changing\nover time to show how the\nmarket fluctuates.\nI want to draw together\nideas around capitalism,\nvalue, and the tangible\nand intangible nature of\nspeculation and collapse\nfrom two very different\nyet surprisingly similar\nmoments in history and\nI found tulips a way to\ndo this. It also updates\nanother tradition \u2013 one of\nthe very first dataset used\nfor computer vision was\nmade from irises.\nFurthermore, there is\na tradition of tulips in art\nhistory. Tulips featured\nprominently in Dutch\nstill life at the time, the\nso-called \u2018vanitas\u2019 paintings that illustrated that\nbeauty and treasure are\nonly fleeting. This piece\nwill update this tradition\nbut with a twist. The GAN\n[generative adversarial\nnetwork] constructs an\nimage not of a real tulip,\nbut what it thinks a tulip\nshould be, much like how\nseventeenth-century still\nlife pictures do not show\nactual displays of flowers\nbut imagined bouquets (it\nwould be impossible for\nsome of the bouquets in\nstill-lifes to exist in reality\nas the flowers shown\nbloom at different times\nof the year).\nIt must\u2019ve been\nexhausting work,\ntaking 10,000\nphotographs of tulips.\nWhat was the process\nlike and how did you\nmake it through?\nIt was a very time\nconsuming process! But\nwhat was quite nice is\nthe even though this is a\nvery digital piece, there is\nwas a very natural rhythm\nto it \u2013 I stopped making\nmy dataset because the\ntulip season ended. I\nwent to the flower market\none weekend and there\nwere no more tulips,\nonly peonies, so I had\nto stop. So even though\nit\u2019s a very digital piece,\nit was very much driven\nby the rhythms of nature.\nAlso \u2013 and this shouldn\u2019t\nhave surprised me given\nthe context \u2013 but it was\nactually extremely difficult to find striped tulips\nand I ended up going\nall over the Netherlands\ntrying to find stripey ones!\nMaking this dataset\nwas so important to this\nproject. I worked testing\nthe dataset in order to\nget the type of output I\nwanted \u2013 and that changed\nwhat type of flowers I\nwas buying, what shape,\nwhat colour. The other\nthing that I had to do for\nthis was categorise every\nsingle photograph by\nhand. What colour, what\ntype of tulip, how striped\nit was, whether it was in\nbud or dying. This was\nan insane amount of work\nand it is usually work\nthat is hidden. The whole\nprocess of creating the\ndataset took around four\nmonths. By choosing\nto make it a separate\nwork that is displayed in\nrelation to the video work,\nI draw attention to this act\nof categorisation \u2013 and\nalso the human element\nof it, by handwriting\neach of the labels. I can\nuse it to start to have\ndiscussions \u2013 particularly\nin non-technical communities \u2013 about the fact that\nthere is always a human\ndecision somewhere\nalong the chain of using\nAI and that it is not this\nabsolute correct thing...\neven something as simple\nas a tulip is difficult to put\ninto discrete categories \u2013\nis it white or pale pink, is\nit orange or yellow \u2013 and\nhow if it\u2019s difficult for\nsomething as simple as\na flower, imagine how\ndifficult it will be for\nsomething as complex as\ngender or identity! It has\nbecome parallel work,\nunpicking ideas to do\nwith labour, technology\nand categorisation and\nalso the humanness that\nis behind every algorithm,\nevery decision made by an\nAI.\nBut despite all of this\ncategorisation it is a\nmistake to think that I\nhave control. It is impossible to predict what will\ncome out in each of the\nstills \u2013 I can guess, but I\ncannot know. And this to\nme is really exciting. It\nis these \u2018mistakes\u2019 that\ndrive me to use this as\na material \u2013 it becomes\nweird and eerie in a way\nthat I wouldn\u2019t be able to\ndo myself, and draws on\nthe history of time-lapse\nphotography but through\na lens.\nDo you ever feel\nwary of technology\nand automation\nencroaching on\nhuman expression as\nsome people believe?\nNo, for me it is very\nmuch a tool and a process.\nI don\u2019t find it encroaching\non human expression, I\nfind it a way of expressing\nmyself more fully, in\nways that I was never able\nto before.\nWhat thoughts or\nimpressions do you\nhope your audience\nwill leave with after\nseeing your works at\nthe Barbican?\nI hope that they can see\nthe poetic potential of this\nas a medium!\nFinally, do you have\nany ideas for future\nprojects and is there\nany technology that\nyou\u2019re hoping to use in\nlater works?\nI\u2019ve making a new\nproject with Opera\nNorth that will debut in\nthe autumn. It\u2019s really\nexciting to push the work\nI\u2019m doing but using sound\nand performance.\n\n"

Together, Sam\nand Ryan showcased\nThe Times' air pollution\ncampaign, \"Clean Air for\nAll\", which launched in\nearly May. During the\npresentation, Sam and\nRyan walked those in\nattendance through three\ninteractive resources\nwhich they created for the\ncampaign:\nThe National Picture:\nAn air pollution postcode\nchecker enabling people\nto see how polluted the\nair they breathe is. The\ndashboard offers powerful\nmetrics, including the\nequivalent number of\nfor a panel discussion\nand Q&A session, which\nfollowed the presenta-tion. Amongst the areas\nof discussion were: the\nimportance of including\ncommunities in decisions about tackling air\npollution, the challenge\nof changing engrained\nbehaviours and attitudes\nsuch as overreliance on\nusing cars and the vital\nrole the media plays in\ncommunicating the seriousness of air pollution to\nthe public and policymakers alike. Chief amongst\nthese discussion topics\nwas the significance of\nwidescale public realisation and aknowledgement\nof the tangible and detrimental health impacts that\nair pollution can have.\nDr. de Nazelle left the\naudience contemplating a\nsobering message:\n\"Death is just the tip of\nthe iceberg. Air pollution\nalso affects birth weight,\nasthma, cancer, cognitive\ndevelopment, diabetes,\nand there are even links to\nobesity. We can't put 'air\npollution' on a death certificate but we know that it\nis a significant contributor\nto many serious illnesses.\"\n(Left to Right): Sam Joiner, Ryan Watts and Dr. Audrey de Nazelle sat on the panel at the event // Fergus Burnett\n\u201cTogether,\nSam and Ryan\nshowcased\nThe Times'\nair pollution\ncampaign,\n'Clean Air for\nAll'\u201d\ncigarettes per month.\nSchool league table:\nA searchable dashboard\nfor checking air quality in\nschools within the Greater\nLondon area.\nDigital essay: An interactive story looking at the\nsteps which could be taken\nto improve air quality in\nthe UK. The digital essay,\ninspired by the click-through storytelling of Instagram Stories, features\ncase studies of how cities\nelsewhere in Europe are\ntackling the air pollution\nproblem.\nForget Brexit: What is being\nignored?\nThe Times has launched a competition to give\none Imperial student the chance to write for Red\nBox, The Times\u2019award-winning political newslet-ter, once a month for a three month period. The\nwinner will also meet Matt Chorley, the editor\nof Red Box, to find out what it\u2019s like working in\nWestminster.\nIf you\u2019re interested, start thinking about what\nare the issues which are important to you that\nare being overlooked while politicians are distracted by Brexit? What is the one law you would\npass if you were prime minister for the day?\nWhat is happening in health, education, hous-ing, employment, welfare, the environment,\ntransport, the arts, sport and family life? And\nwhat will be the long-term impact on Britain if\nthe problems are not tackled soon?\n\"The long-running dispute that saw countrywide strikes last year\" // Flickr\nThis is to ensure that the\nrecovery of the USS\u2019\ndeficit (\u00a33.6 billion as\nof March 2018) is not\nhampered. However, this\napproach would require\nfurther negotiations,\nwhich would not be completed until summer 2020.\nThis means the planned\nincreases in October 2019\nand April 2020 would still\ngo ahead.\nThe \u201clower bookend\u201d\napproach would set contributions at 20.4% from\nemployers and 9.3%\nfrom staff for a total of\n29.7%. However, this\napproach is dependent on\nbeing able to guarantee\nthat extra \u201ccontingent\ncontributions\u201d would be\navailable in the event of\nan economic downturn.\nThe USS has now\nput forward a third way.\nThis would see increased\ncontributions of 30.7%\n(21.1% from employers\nand 9.6% from staff) come\ninto effect in October\n2019. This would increase\nto 34.7% in October 2021\nunless a new arrangement\nis agreed following\nanother valuation in 2020.\n\u201cThe planned\nincreases in\nOctober 2019\nand April 2020\nwould still go\nahead\u201d\nIt is not clear how this\ncontribution would be\nsplit between employers\nand staff.\nResponses from staff\nwere collected by the\nCollege last week. Imperial\u2019s formal response to\nthe consultation will be\npublished ahead of next\nweek\u2019s deadline of 30\nMay.\n\"The main challenge\nwith these interactives\nwas translating the topic\nto our readers in a way\nthat was relatable and\neasily understandable\",\nexplained Ryan whilst\nhighlighting The Times\nand Sunday Times interactive team's aim to create\ncontent which enhances\nthe reader's comprehension of a story in visually\ncompelling ways. Sam\nconcurred and echoed this\nsentiment, adding:\n\"Scientific language\nalone doesn't always\nwork well, that's why\nwe thought about using\ncigarettes as an equiva-lent, for example. It was\nsomething we can all get\nour head around.\"\nSam and Ryan were\nlater joined by Dr. Audrey\nde Nazelle, Senior lecturer in the Faculty of\nNatural Sciences, Centre\nfor Environmental Policy,\n\u201cDeath is\nthe tip of the\niceberg\u201d\nA special opportunity\nfor an Imperial student to\nwrite for The Times' Red\nBox newsletter was also\nannounced at the event.\nTo enter the competition,\nwhich closes on Monday\n3rd\nJune, students must\nsend a 500 word submission via e-mail or the\ncompetition webpage. The\nwinner will be announced\non 24th\nJune.\nThe year-long partnership between Imperial and\nThe Times, which has seen\na programme of activities\nwith the aim to \"stimulate\ndebate, provoke curiosity\nand explore the future of\nscience, technology and\nculture\", will continue\nwith The Times confirmed\nto feature in the Great\nExhibition Road Festival\n2019 from 28th\nto 30th\nJune.

The lyric(s) of\nthe album opener and title\ntrack of Mac DeMarco\u2019s\nfifth full-length studio\nrecord \u2014 and his first\nunder his own label rather\nthan long-term partners\nCaptured Tracks \u2014 leave\none thinking that this\nmight be one of his\nmost minimal yet. And\nindeed it is, as DeMarco\npushes the successful but\nstraightforward formula\nthat has come to define\nhis style (the self-labelled\n\u201cjizz-jazz\u201d consisting\nof unprocessed vocals,\na couple of guitars,\nsimple drums, bass, and\na sprinkling of synths) in\na further stripped-back\ndirection, picking up\nfrom the acoustic-guitar-and-dreamy-synth-based\ntracks that formed a key\npart of 2017\u2019s This Old\nDog.\nHere Comes the\nCowboy was recorded in a\ncouple of weeks this past\nJanuary, out of DeMarco\u2019s\ngarage in a rainy LA (you\ncan even hear the rain\npetering in and out of a\nfew tracks on the album).\nSuch a scene goes hand-in-hand with the sound\nand songwriting on this\nrecord, which is perhaps\nalso best enjoyed as the\nsoundtrack to chilling\nindoors on a rainy day\nor soothing a post-New\nYears-scale hangover \u2014\nthis cowboy ain\u2019t riding\nthrough the Wild West.\nDon\u2019t let the simple\nproduction fool you,\nhowever: while the album\nmight be a reduced version\nof the Mac we know, and\ndoes drag in a place or\ntwo, the highlights on\nthis record showcase the\nessence of what earned\nDeMarco his status as\na modern poster-boy of\nindie \u2014 Here Comes the\nCowboy features some\nof Mac DeMarco\u2019s finest\nwork to date.\nplaints of a privileged\ncelebrity, DeMarco\u2019s\nsongwriting feels particularly authentic, thanks to\nthe restrained production\nand instrumentation,\nwhich often foregrounds\nhis voice (his crooning\non \u2018Skyless Moon\u2019 is\na personal highlight)\n-- and the fact that we as\nlisteners have directly\nwitnessed the growing\nfame underpinning many\nof the lyrics on this\nalbum. Further, moments\non this record feel like an\nadmission of regret from\nthe ever-cool-cowboy\nover actions taken in the\npublic eye.\nDeMarco might not be\nasking for our sympathy,\nbut it\u2019s hard not to feel\nsome when a figure who\nhas become somewhat of\na reference point in contemporary meme culture\n(admittedly at the result\nof their own actions),\nlaments not being able to\nbe \u201cnobody\u201d for once.\nOn the flip side,\nDeMarco hasn\u2019t missed\nthe opportunity of his\nlabel-freedom to give us\na few wild and outrageous\nmoments on this album\n(I won\u2019t spoil them all),\nfrom his bold decision to\nstart the record with the\nsame phrase repeated over\nand over for a perfect three\nminutes, to his mimicking\na steam engine on \u2018Choo\nChoo\u2019. It might be out\nof place, ridiculous, and\nmusically non-ground-breaking, but one can\u2019t\nhelp enjoy seeing Mac\nlet go and enjoy himself\non this record, be that in\nthese bizarre moments or\nthe album\u2019s bare-bones,\ngarage-DIY production\nthat leaves each track at\nthe mercy of its songwriting only: since there\u2019s\nno turning back, might\nas well continue making\nthe most of it, right?\nIn addition, there are a\nfew tracks, \u2018All of Our\nYesterdays\u2019 in particular,\nthat really feel like classic\nMac, even with their fairly\nhands-off production. All\nof this makes for an album\nthat, in its totality, might\nseem like a watered-down\nversion of the same-old to\nsome fans, and too-laid\nback to others, but nonetheless contains material\nto appeal to both. This\nisn\u2019t Mac DeMarco\u2019s\nbest album, but it does\nmerit a few listens, which\nwill hopefully reveal to\nthe listener that some\ntracks really do marry\ncomposition, production,\nand lyrics well enough to\nmake them highlights of\nhis career thus far.\nI really don\u2019t see what this cover has to do with cowboys. // Mac\u2019s Record Label\nMUSIC\nNeel Le Penru\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Mac DeMarco.\nLabel: Mac\u2019s Record Label.\nTop Tracks: Nobody,\nFinally Alone, All of our\nYesterdays, Skyless Moon.\nFor Fans Of: Ariel Pink,\nHomeshake, Kurt Vile, King\nKrule. 47 minutes\nHERE COMES THE COWBOY\nThe Cowboy himself, Mac DeMarco, tuning up to lay\ndown some janky rhythms. // Tree Music Festival\n\u201cThis might be\none of his most\nminimal yet.\u201c\nPart of that has to do\nwith the lyrical content of\nthis album: the semi-in-trospective, casual rumination on love and life\non this album might not\nseem much different from\nany on Mac\u2019s past work,\nbut look closer and you\u2019ll\nsee that this cowboy is\nalso singing about being\nfed-up with the complexities of modern life\n(perhaps explaining some\nof the basic writing and\nproduction choices on the\nalbum) and burden of his\nown fame.
