    "content": "2 News 2 November 1998\nKing's Lose Their Roar In brief... By Brett Donovan\nIn a highly contentious series of events,\nROAR, the King's College Student Newspaper, has recently received a mention\nin the House Of Lords. It transpires that\nBaroness Rawlings was, as usual, mailed\na copy of the publication and was\nenraged by the nature of its front page.\nThe 7 October release featured an article on the problems of 'c ott aging' within\ncollege premises. The expose resulted\nin a month's suspension for the editor,\nThe controversial cover\nRupert Matthews. The punishment was\ndecided upon at a disciplinary committee on grounds of contravening King's equal opportunity policy.\nThe cover story tells of a problem\nBy Brett Donovan\nThe Conservative society played host to\nthe Rt. Honourable Michael Howard MP\nthis past Wednesday. Howard, the\nshadow foreign secretary started by giving an anecdotal story about the disappearance of Humphrey 'the downing\nstreet cat' and went on to give a refined\nsummary of the fallibility of New Labour.\nHe spoke of the current financial situation facing us, including rising unemployment and high interest rates. He\ndevoted time to talk on single currency\nissues and Europe with sound reasons\nand plenty of examples illustrating why\nnot to opt for the single currency whilst\ndefending the party's stance on 'no entry'\nas opposed to the wait and see\napproach. Much of his visit was spent\nanswering questions on wildly varying\nsubjects, with interesting and amusing\nbanter between the students and\nwith students and others using the faculty bathrooms to perform sexual acts. It\nreports of \"eye witnesses seeing cubicles\nwobble\". The issue was regarded by\nmany King's students as \"the best issue\nyet, with all 5,000 copies being snapped\nup in record time\". Equally astonishing\nwas the low number of complaints;\napparently \"five out of a total student\npopulation of 18,000 and no complaints\nfrom the homosexual community\". All\nfive complaints were made by medics,\nsome objecting to the additional graphic\nin the female section depicting the cli-tor is. Many just can't see any problem\nwith the publication with a number of\npeople congratulating the ROAR team.\nHowever this suspension has left the\nstudents without the next two issues of\nthe fortnightly publication. The fate of\nMatthews lies in the hands of King's student parliament and a potential vote of\nno confidence, and hence a sacking.\nInside sources suggest that at the very\nleast Matthews will have to compromise\nROAR's content, this may involve the\npresident of the union having to oversee\nthe publication before it is finalised for\nprinting. Matthews explained to Felix\nthat he was \"simply trying to entertain\nthe students\". These events may instigate further repercussions for other student newspapers.\nMichael Howard makes his point\nHoward. Anyone can attend a speaker\nmeeting, the next one is the 4 November (1pm2 pm) with Dr Liam Fox MP.\nDetails nearer time.\nMedical Correction\nA number of inaccuracies in last week's story headed 'Medics Blow Cash' have\ncome to light since the article went to\npress.\nFirstly, the aborted graduation ball\nwas not organised by the Imperial College School of Medicine Rugby squad,\nand indeed did not have any connection\nwith the team. The Rugby squad arc in\nthe process of organising their own winter ball, which has been organised\naccording to the correct procedures and\nhas been planned since last July.\nSecondly, after negotiations\nbetween ICU and the hotel in question,\nthe amount lost as a result of cancellation fell from \u00a37500 to \u00a33000.\nThirdly, the Medical Freshers Ball,\nover which concern was expressed in the\nlast issue, proved to be a great achieve-ment. Over five hundred people\nattended, with many declaring the ball\none of the best they'd ever been to. Consequently, despite the last minute organ-is ation, the event was both a financial\nand social success.\nMore Suspect Speakers\nDodgy white vans were out in force\nonce again this week. Operating from a different van to last week, a white 5ft6\" male with an Irish accent, black jeans and\nquilted jacket was selling video recorders\nand TVs. Speakers seem to have been\nremoved from this week's menu. One\nstudent was approached and offered\nthese suspect goods, being threatened\nafter sensibly proclaiming \"our student\nnewspaper has run a story about you, I'm off to phone the police\". As before,\nfelix's advice is; don't hand over any\nmoney or get into the vehicle, and\nreport any encounter to us as soon as\npossible or, if violence is threatened, to\nthe authorities.\nBMS Sounds Bad\nICSM second years from Charing Cross\nwere left decidedly unimpressed with\nthe new BMS building on Wednesday.\nThe building, which has so far been\ndogged with problems, certainly lived\nup to its reputation. Uncomfortable seat-ing, dod gy sound systems and unpredictable alarms marred the first lecture\non the new site. The morning was interrupted by whistling and le sling messages from an unknown source,\nfollowed by a constant hissing and whining from the microphone and speakers.\nIssue 1124\n2 November 1998\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nPhotographic Editor: William Lorenz\nMusic Editors: Jason Ramanathan and\nDenis Patrickson\nNews Editors: Andy Ofori\nHim Lditor: David Roberts\nGames Editor: Gary Smith\nArts Editor: Helena Cocheme\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nAssault Charge\nReports have been coming in of a scuffle at the well known medics' night spot Hombres' last week. A rather merry\nfresher was knocked to the ground and\nresponded with a swift punch, unfortunately selecting the wrong individual as\nhis assailant, resulting in a charge of\nABH.\nCycling Crackdown\nLocal Police are warning IC students to\navoid being caught out by Kensington &\nChelsea Council's latest crackdown. The\nCouncil have decided that the greatest\nsocial problem facing the local citizenry\nis that of cycling on pavements. Eschewing the traditional targets of drugs, mug-g ing, murder and rape, the Council have\ninstructed our local Met to charge all\nthose caught indulging in this heinous\nact, with stiff fines awaiting the guilty.\nSilly as this may sound, it has already\nresulted in the prosecution of at least\none IC student, who was fined \u00a375. So,\nunless you too want to end up seriously\nout of pocket, cycling should be confined\nto roads and dedicated cycle paths for\nthe foreseeable future.\nHustings\nQuestion and Answer sessions for the\ncandidates for the Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) election will take place\non the three main campuses this week.\nToday, hustings will take place in\nSouth Ken, at 6pm in dB's. On Tuesday\nthose involved move to Charing Cross,\nwhere hustings will take place at 6pm in\nthe Reynolds Building.

The phat selection comes\nwith only three tunes this week, two from the Bad Boy\nfamily who are looking to storm the charts with album\nreleases from Total, 112 and Faith.\nLast week was dominated by news from the Bad\nBoy camp. We start of with the MOBO awards from just\nup the road at the Royal Albert Il all where Puffy picked\nup the Outstanding Achievement award; thing is he's still only in his twenties, so what they gonna give him\nnext time he comes over? At the MOBO's Puffy performed a little medley of tracks, but the real story\ncomes from the sound check before. Puff spent over\nan hour doing his sound check and Mel B came on asking to do hers, Puffy told her to fuck off before storming off himself. Mel apparently didn't take it to heart and\neven called him incredible before he came on stage for\nhis performance. Me thinks she's trying to keep on his\ngood side, so she can ask him for help with her solo\ncareer. Puff must know that helping Mel would be as\nbad as doing a collaboration with Jimmy Page O shit,\nhe's already done that. As well as Puff, Faith Evans and\nTotal also showed up from the Bad Boy stable, both performed live on stage. Faith kicked it with Love Like This\nand Total rocked with their brand of street soul. The very\nnext day the Bad Boy Family cruised down to Sound\nRepublic in Leicester Square and performed in front of\na select, invitation only, group and anyone with MTV.\nThis was the first time Puffy has ever done a proper set\nanywhere in Europe and he chose the just finished\nSound Republic, word from the curb is that Puff has\ninvested a bit of money in the restaurant, club complex.\nThe gentlemen of Bad Boy, 112, started things off with\nOnly You and then ran through some new stuff showing off their vocal range and plugging their new album\nRoom 112 due to drop on November 9th. The first track\noff it should be Love Me featuring Mase, its doing the\nrounds on promo at the minute and if you heard it you\nknow its quite simply the bomb. The album also features\ncollaborations with the likes of Faith Evans and Lil Kim.\nTotal were next up, they performed the classic Can't You\nSee before dropping a coup ie of tracks from their new-album Kima, Keisha & Pam. Ihe first single to be lifted\nfrom it is gonna be Trippin with Missy on production,\nthe track's not really worthy of Total and I hope the\nalbum has more to offer, cos this is poor. Album to hit\nthe streets on November 2nd. Then came the woman\nwho is trying to lay claim to MaryJ's crown - Faith Evans.\n~if t KI\\ in cd.1 LI IE Vall o tarry an\nnext week vu tal e ah><>k at the album that\nl all s. This was the i its l album from Ihe Bad\n:&B tip and It set a high standard. At the time\nilks were claiming that Faith hadn't the ski IIz\nim herself and that she was getting special\ntreatment: because she was the u iF of mega-star Biggie,\nler experience as a backing singer and writing partner\nfor Maryj Blige (queen of street soul) didn't mean a thing fin certain people. But her a de bul set Faith\nreal K on; pi >>ele to sit up and pav attention \"ill\ngot the skill? and a little bit more, the album opened\nup brilliantly with the classy No Other Love, then\ncame the Maty J penned mid tempo number Fallln\nIn Love and followed by the chunk v You Remind Me:\nFaith slowed\n; Rose Royce i vith a duet, with Maryj, cover of\nwe Don'tI ive Ile re No Mote. The\n'To Love Me was up next, still one\nlove keeps on going with the stun-the way to the wicke'd slow jam\nFaith performed the monster tunes You Used To Love\nMe and Soon As I Get Home with faultless vocals\nbefore doing the stunning Love Like This. I ler new\nalbum Keep the Faith is due out next month and you\nknow you gotta have it. After Faith's performance Puffy\nseemed like a bit of an anti-climax, Lil Caesar helped him\nout with the rapping (where's Mase?) as he raced\nthrough the tunes Come With Me, Can't Nobody Il old Us Down and many others including some Biggie cl as sics. The night was closed out with a full rendition of\nMissing You, Faith and 112 were both there as well as\na full gospel choir.\nJust a quick word on the soul boys of Britain,\nAnother Level. Ila ving just picked up a MOBO for best\nsingle for their massive hit Freak Me and just missing\nout on the award for best newcomers (losing out to\nDavid Lyden Il all). Now they're back with their latest single Guess I was A Fool, this is a really classy tune with\nexcellent, tight production from the Blacksmith crew.\nGuess I Was.... should cement their position as the best\nBritish R&B group out there at the minute.\nMilen\nStop The Presses\nWhere was Mase when Puffy was over here? Whenever you see Puffy you normally see Mase, where Is\nMase? Well sources (Gbenga) say that he's parted company with the Bad Boy camp and has hooked up with\nthe pint sized Jermaine Dupri at So So Def Records. At\nthe minute It's all just rumours, but does explain why\nIII Caesar was helping Puffy at Sound Republic rather\nthan Mase. Another reason for the rumours Is that Mase\nsigned his new group Harlem World to the So So Def\nlabel rather than to Bad Boy. Gets ya think ln don't it,\nanyway I 'll keep you Informed.\nPhat Selection\nLove Like This - Faith Evans\nPuffy samples Chic's Chic Cher to\ncreate the tune of the year, where's the album?\nLove Me -112 featuring Mase\nThe hugely talented 112 return\nwith this wicked tune sampling an\nold Luther Vandross track and Mase\nfeaturing with the rap.\nLittle Bit of LovIn Kelly Le Roc\nClassy British soul, beautifully\nsmooth vocals over a lovely keyboard\nriff.\n\n"

However, if you\nbypass the foyer of reassembled\ndinosaur skeletons and cross the corridor\nof prehistoric fossils, you reach a darkened gallery from which obscure bird\nsquawks and animal howls emanate. Let\nme reassure you - these recorded bursts\nof commotion are purely atmospheric,\nsetting the scene for a collection that glorifies the natural world.\nThe museum recently unveiled the\nresults of the fifteenth annual wildlife\nphotographer competition, organised by\nBBC Wildlife Magazine. Enthusiasts from\nsome 60 countries battled for this prestigious title, coveted by amateurs and\nprofessionals alike. In excess of 20,000\nentries were received and narrowed\ndown to the 1 SO images on display. Presented either as enlarged, illuminated\ntransparencies or included in a slide pro-j ect ion, the collection maintains the traditional standards of quality associated\nwith the award. Granted, the general\nformat of the exhibition hardly changes\nfrom one year to the next. But then\nagain, why change a winning for-mula?

You might\nthink that your expensive-to-rent\nabode is a gro tty, draught y, pestilent\nhole, and that the stair carpet bears a foul, clashing pattern; a criminally distorted product of the opiate d1970s mindset.

The article in Felix may, if seen by\nlocal Councillors, have sunk once again,\nthe sports centre development in Princes\nCadens, where maintaining a quality\nenvironment is of the highest priority.\nWe in Estates Division are battling to\nachieve the best facilities for IC student e.

However, as trees do feature\nin the plan for the general beautification\nof the South Kensington Campus, perhaps College will consider taking advantage of the offer. Judging by the cost of\nthe flower beds, it could amount to quite\na saving.\nMartin O 'Reilly\nChange the Music II\nDear Ed,\nIn replying to Tim Wright's letter In Felix\nabout the \"indie shite\" played in dBs on\na Wednesday night, I think Mark Home\nhas missed the point. The fact is that\nevery Wednesday, the same old records\nare played. It wouldn't be so bad if they\nweren't always in the same order, or if\nthe playlist had changed a bit since last\nyear (OK, there are one or two new\nrecords).

Not only do we have halloween,\nbut Guy Fawkes night probably is older\nthan Guy Fawkes himself, and even the\nmodern Armistice day appropriately falls\naround this time.

    "content": "26 Clubs & Diversions 2 November 1998\nCome rain, come snow, come sleet, come hail - Nothing can stop IC's intrepid explorers.\nMountaineering\nWe woke up fairly early on the morning\nof Saturday the 17th, crawled out of our\ntents and paid the nice but insistent\nman for the privilege of using his camp-site. Since this was the Peak District, the\nweather wasn't too bad: there was definitely a small patch of blue sky over\ntowards the horizon. We went for breakfast at a cafe between the campsite and\nthe crags, and then stopped in the village\nof Heathersage to pick up food for lunch.\nThis turned into a fairly long delay as several members were gripped by con-sumer is t frenzy and disappeared into\nthe \"Outdoors\" shop, emerging with\nlighter wallets and shiny new gear.\nThe crag at Stannage was fairly quiet,\nand we were soon climbing - for many\nFreshers this was their first experience of\noutdoor rock. The wind at the top of the\ncrag was incredibly cold, so after one\nroute most people took a break for\nlunch. It started raining shortly after two,\nand after about half an hour of downpour we gave up on the chance of any\nmore climbing that day and retired to the\npub. We headed back to the campsite at\nabout half past five and established ourselves in the Robin Hood Inn just down\nthe road.\nIt soon became obvious that the\nwhole pub was full of university climbing\nclubs: Bristol, De Montfort, Oxford and\nBrunell were here. Once everyone had\nsettled down to the serious business of\ngetting very drunk, with our VP, Gareth,\norganising a boat race between the different universities. Unfortunately, the IC\nteam only finished third (Bristol won), but\nmuch fun was had by all. After closing\ntime we returned to the campsite to\nfind a hard frost, but we ignored this in\nthe cause of inter-club relations and\nstayed up drinking and watching the\nstars for an hour or so.\nSunday morning was bright and\nclear, but still very cold. Stannagc was\nmuch busier than Saturday so we went\nto the next crag along. We had an excellent afternoon's climbing, with all the\nnew members getting several routes\ndone. As the day ended, everyone gathered round the base of the crag to watch\nRob attempt to lead a fairly hard over-hang. He backed off eventually, after\nspending a long time sat on a small\nledge trying to figure out how to pro-cee d, encouraged by several hecklers\nand the occasional paper missile. We\nreturned to London refreshed after a good weekend.\nFellwanderers\nOn Friday, after the minibus was finally\nliberated from Linstead, 14 intrepid Fellwanderers set off on the first trip of the\nyear. The majority of these were suckers\nfrom last year who should have known\nbetter, the others innocent fresher s who\nnow do know better. After fighting\nthrough London and up the Ml, we\nfinally arrived at the hostel in Crowden.\nAfter a cup of tea, we retired before\nthe conversation degenerated too far. As\nthe dawn broke, so did a wave of\nlethargy over the hostel, as the curtains\nwere pulled back by bleary eyed fell-wanderers to see water - everywhere.\nMost of it coming at a sharp angle\nthrough the air due to the gale force\nwinds accompanying it. The curtains\nwere drawn again, and bodies returned\nunder the duvets.\nEventually, everyone was up, and\nthe decision made to venture into the\nwetlands. This was partly due to the lack\nof alternatives - the hostel was public is ing an exhibition of allotments past, present and future. So we went for a level\ntrek around nearby reservoirs on a disused railway line. A short section along\nthe main road was necessary, with the\nshorts wearers providing great entertainment for the drivers, especially the\ntwo girls in the mini, who gave Tim a nice\nflash. Of their lights, of course. By this\ntime, everyone was somewhat damp, so\nthe unanimous decision was taken to\nventure into Glossop, where some time\nand money were killed at a tea shop.\nSunday was more promising, so we\nwalked up Black Hill. The rain mostly\nheld off, and there were even sunny\nspells, although one group discovered\nhail blown by gale force winds is not very\npleasant. The quality of the path varied\nfrom knee deep peat to motorway quality path, although this was regularly intercepted by the river, causing a few wet\nfeet. A walk further south in the district\nwas the last walking of the trip, through\nand over a valley that looked a little wetter than it should. The river lapping at the\nfarmhouse was the giveaway for that.\nMore cups of tea all round, then ploughing down the M1 in search of dinner.\nA few adventures later (let's just say\nwe won't be going to Toddington again),\nwe finally settled for the good old Chequers pub. So, the trip drew to a close.\nVery wet, but it takes a lot more than a bit of rain to keep the Fellwanderers\ndown.

    "content": "2 November 1998 Music 19\nELECTRIC CAFE\ndBs\nGo to the Union on a Saturday\nnight? You must be joking, or\nat least very bored. Surely\nLondon's nightlife, or the crowded\natmosphere of Southside Bar, provide a far better environment in which to\nspend the evening...\nLast year I would have agreed with\nthis view, encouraged it even. Apart\nfrom the bars the Union did not have\nmuch going for it at the weekend, and\nwas no match for the pubs and clubs of\nfond on. Things are changing, however.\nThe new dBs, coupled with some determined students, has allowed the creation of two new monthly Saturday night\ndance nights. Electric Cafe is one of\nthem, and it's not at all bad.\nPlaying a spectrum of underground\ndance, from house through techno and\ndrum 'n' bass to ambient, the dance\nfloor atmosphere is definitely different\nfrom the regular Ents nights. It has more\nof a club feel to it, the music is harder\nand faster, the lights lower, the dancing\nmore free form. The DJing, although all\ndone by students, has a professional\nedge to it - but then Electric Cafe has\nbeen a regular show on IC Radio for the\nlast three years. They know their music,\nand they know how to mix it.\nOkay, so it is only open until midnight and is less crowded than weekday\nevenings; on the opening night there\nwere about two hundred people in dBs\nfor the final hour. You may feel as\nthough you've wandered into a club in\nthat empty hour after the doors open. In\na way, however, this is what makes it a good pre-clubbing night. You can take\nadvantage of the Union's cheap alcohol,\nwarm up your dancing shoes, and be on\nthe tube into the West End by half past\nmidnight. At the same time it caters for\nthose who just want a few drinks before\nthey go home - now you can have a quick dance as well.\nThe music will not be to everyone's taste but, If you like your dance, trance\nand magic plants, you could do a lot\nworse for no money. Congratulations\nmust go out to all those involved in\norganising the night - now it's up to us,\nthe students, to make it a success. See\nyou on the dance floor, d Ed\nNext Electric Cafe, Saturday 7\nNovember, 8pm12 am, Free.\nTINDERSTICKS\nDonkeys '92-97'\nModern day R and B infused\nwith soulful dynamics, a gospel-tinged voice of angelic\nbeauty. I lang on, that's not\nTindersticks! Tindersticks? Yeah,\nTindersticks. Oh sorry, I thought you\nsaid ll in daI licks. Let's start again.\nDionysian abandonment and joy has\nconsistently spawned kick-ass, feelgood music. Yet downbeat songs of\nsobriety entertain an equal place in the\nParthenon of pop/rock music, the cold\nmelancholic undertow adds an insight\nto the sea of life, a current of understanding that isn't clouded by rose-tint-ed glasses, a consequential recognition\nof a kindred spirit leading to relief and\ncontentment; sad songs that can make\nyou happy.\nIt is through such waters Tindersticks\nhave trawled since their inception in 92,\nStuart Staple's Cohenesque-vocals coupling with subtle orchestration that does-n't engulf and nullify the beauty of the\nsongs. Il ello Embrace, are YOU taking\nnotes?\nThis collection presents the listener\nwith a broad overview of the story so far,\nranging from the well known (relatively\nwell known, that is, we are talking about\nTindersticks) to the obscure, f he album\nstarts with their first singles Patchwork,\nMarbles and City Slickness and the scene\nis set. The glorious shuffle of Travelling\nLight soon follows with Stuart and The\nWalkabouts' Carla Thorgesson mournfully reminiscing about what could of\nbeen. A cover of Otis Redding'sI 've\nBeen Loving You Too Long is next, gently sliding through the mind with a patter of drums before reaching a heart-wrenching crescendo of strings\nand trumpet; you see Embrace subtlety\nreally can work. A cover of Pavements'\nHere leads to Tiny Tears whet e we find\nTindersticks at their most fragile, a song\nof minimalist beauty.\nAs the album glides towards its\nfinale, A Marriage Made In Heaven\nemerges through the elegant misery, a farcical number featuring the woefully\ninept Isabella Rossellini, and being all the\nbetter for it. For Those... closes the compilation with its quirky Casio-keyboard\nrefrain and as the Manics said so succinctly we're 'I lapp y being sad'. CI\nChris\nSingles\nCalexlco - Stray\nVery mellow with a nice use of samples. The first track,\nStray, sounds particularly good; there is latin influence\nin the sound. Sadly this isn't followed through into the\nb sides, which aren't as good.\nEssen - Supernatural\nDreamy and relaxing, although it never really invades\nyour concentration. This is pretty much sonic wallpaper;\nput it on, then do something else instead. It's pretty\ngood and the title track has nice beats that fit in well.\nThe Paradise Motel - Hollywood Landmines\nThis tries to be too much. The song starts with a moody\nbass and guitar, some subdued drumming and vocals\nthat really fit in. Then things are ruined by someone\ndeciding that a string section in the chorus would be\na good idea. A good song ruined by a bad idea.\nLukan - See You Dying\nThis is emotive arena rock. It's that simple. Actually it is\nvery well done, although the songs stray close to Live\n(the band) in sound at times. With the right promotion\nthis band could be big, especially in America.\nBis - Eurodlsco\nBis will always be a band that are much better live than\non record. However, this song is actually one of their\nbetter studio efforts, although it does sound a bit too\nnew romantic at times. The b side Like Robots, however,\nis a really bad song. It's a clich ed idea that has been\ndone really badly here.\nPortlshead - PNYC\nI'm not sure what Is going to happen with this. It features four tracks recorded live in the USA, which means\nthat it doesn't count as a single. It's definitely worth buy-ing, as there is a nice balance between quite relaxed\nbits and louder angst y bits. The live aspect of this single Is a bit dubious, though, as the crowd is only heard\nat the end of songs. H Jamie\nJames - Sit Down '98\nThe remixing and re-releasing of such 'feel-good' and\nchirp y toons are usually either storming hits or very big\nmistakes. This '98 release contains two remixes as well\nas the original version. Both of the remixes keep all the\nlyrics with the second mix keeping the upbeat guitar bits\nfrom the original in as well.\nReally all that has been done is to replace the drums\nwith a few Dr Who theme tune effects. Very likeable\nactually.\nFleece - 7\n7\n?\n/\ns Is What You Get For Love.\nCheesy quirky upbeat pop tune along the lines of The\nCardigans. Features the refrain 'what would you do with\na brain if you had one?' and closes with another refrain\n'For Love', this time sung in a female Monty Python\nvoice. The b side A Better Way of Living is quite 70's influenced - the opening is reminiscent of T Rex and the\nvocalist sounds like David Bowie. Also included is a remix of the title track. Certain to be an MTV favourite,\neven if it doesn't make the charts.\n22 Pisteplrkko - Onion Soup\nAnyone who writes a song based around the question\n'Are we gonna have some Onion Soup?' deserves\nsome credit, even if it leads to the boy band style\nrepetitive chorus of 'She said Yeah' over and over and\nover etc. This should appeal to all under eleven who prefer a rockier edge to their prefabricated boy/girl band drivel.\nKomputer - Terminus\nAn instantly catchy dance tune with the occasional\nupbeat keyboard refrain. Five different versions of the\nsame track on one CD mean that it can be a building\nup, a winding down or a happening club action tune\ndepending on the remix chosen and the time of day\nor night.\nPurity - Interference\nRepublica-like lyrics spoken in a Saffron-like voice accompanied by fast pulsating beats, best describes InterFerence. The other tracks Baby Universe and Dark Water\naren't as aggressive as the main track but make for mellow listening.\nWilt - No Worries\nNo wilting here - instantly likeable but grows even\nmore likeable each time you listen. Its a promo CD featuring three upbeat rocky/indie tunes - No Worries,\nWorking For the Man and / Want it All'feature versatile\nvocals and chunky guitars. Definitely one to look out for.\nSwell - Make Up Your Mind\nI did, rather quickly. It's dire. A title like this just asks for\na direct response, don't you think? Four tracks with\ninaudible monotonic vocals accompanied by an annoyingly buzz y guitar and drums. The last track is a cover\nof the Stones' Street Fighting Man. Not even this saves\nit. El\nKatherine.\n\n"

    "content": "24 Film 2 November 1998\nReviews\nHalloween H20 * *\nAdam Arkin, Josh Harknett, Michelle Williams\nOoooooh- Spooky\nStarring : Jamie Lee Curtis,\nDirector: Steve Miner\nHorror movies are clearly back in\nvogue, thanks to the massive\nhits Scream and Scream 2.\nConsequently all the big Hollywood studios have leapt upon the opportunity to\nresurrect that jaded old format - the horror franchise. Witness December's rushed appearance of / Still Know What\nYou Did Last Summer, hot on the heels\nof last year's minor hit. Worst of all,\nhowever, greedy execs have seized\nupon the opportunity to resuscitate\nthose franchises that we all hoped were\ndead and buried.\nConsequently, we now see the biz-za rely mon ice red Halloween 1120 thrust\nupon us - the seventh installment in the\nseemingly immortal Halloween franchise.\nMichael Myers first started Jamie Lee\nCurtis around with a \"very big knife\"IM in\nJohn Carpenter's original twenty years\nago (hence the title), and since then the\nbody count has steadily continued to rise,\nwhilst production values have slowly\nevaporated.\nAll this was supposed to end with the\nrelease of Halloween 1120 - a genuine\nhorror movie for the post-Scream gen-e ration. Indeed for the first three-quarters\nof an hour you can't help feeling that the\nwriters have seen Scream once too often.\nYoung innocent girls are brutally stabbed\n(preferably whilst wearing tight tops);\nJamie Lee Curtis gives a start every time\nsomeone walks up behind her; and\neverybody behaves as if they're really,\nreally stupid.\nYet where Scream was so successful,\nHalloween 1120 falls flat. For starters, it\nlacks the humour and self-knowing irony\nof Wes Craven's recent work - so rather\nthan looking amusing and ironic, it just\nlooks stupid. Secondly, the direction isn't in the same class. There's no sense of\ntension or genuine fear. Above all, director Steve Miner and writer Robert Zappia\ncommit the cardinal sin of predictability,\nnever leaving you in any doubt over\nwho's going to live and who's going to\ndie.\nAs far as the plot is concerned, the\npremise is a simple one. Jamie Lee Curtis has faked her death, moved to California and changed her name from\nLaurie Strode to Keri Tate. Now a successful headmistress and mother, she is\nstill haunted by the dark deeds of her\nbrother, the infamous Michael Myers,\ntwenty years ago. Now those of you who\nhave hacked through the entire franchise will recall that when Michael supposedly died, they never found his body.\nObviously, in horror franchise terms that's as good as saying he's still alive. Well,\nnow he's back....\nUltimately, however, it's the ending\nthat really spoils Halloween 1120. At less\nthan ninety minutes in length, there's not\nenough time to develop any believable\ncharacters or atmosphere, and consequently the denouement just seems out\nof place when it arrives. It's surprising, but\nthat doesn't stop it being bad.D Dave\nRecord of Lodoss war * \u2022 *\nIria - Zieram: The Animation * * * *\nPioneer, the company responsible\nfor distributing Lodoss War and\nIria has a good history of releasing\nquality anime. Kishin Corps and The\nlla kke nden, despite their strange titles,\nhave offered a great deal of enjoyment\nin terms of animation and storyline, so\nwere these two videos up to that high\nstandard?\nRecord of Lodoss War\nRecord of Lodoss War is based on a Japanese role playing game of\nthe same name. As with most\nPioneer titles the series spans over several volumes (in this case six video\ntapes) and so buying the whole series\nmay be prohibitive. The videos are a mixture of Dungeons & Dragons and\nthe crusades, with King Marmo wishing\nto seize control of the island of Lodoss,\nwhile the main story centres on a young\nknight (Parn), an elf (Deedlit) and a dwarf warrior (Ghim). Within all conflicts\nthere are wars and bloodshed, and\nRecord of Lodoss War shows them vivid-ly. The animation is detailed and\nsmooth and can't be faltered. I low ever the dubbing tends to be a bit corny and\nwith the numerous characters with their\nown stories to tell, it is easy to loose\ntrack of the sub plots.\nIria Zieram: The Animation\nDespite only being given\nEpisodes 5 and 6 of this anime\nto review, the basic plot is\nextremely easy to grasp. Zeiram is a being that simply melds and consumes\nits enemies. With the ability to clone\nhimself and its prey, Zeiram is running\namok on the Iria's home planet Myce.\nLooking past our heroine's attractive\narmour and big gun Iria is a character\nthat has been tormented by the loss of\nher brother to this monstrosity. The\nvideo is a very original piece of anime,\nattempting to reinvent the wheel in\nterms of the overall design. The strange\nvehicle and build in designs and the\nbewildering a ray of gadgets are simply\nenlightening and beautiful. IriaZieram is a superb example of good\nanime and with only three volumes it's not that expensive.D Magpie\n\n"

    "content": "14 Arts 2 November 1998\nMIRROR IMAGE: JONATHAN MILLER ON MIRRORS\nNational Gallery, Sainsbury Wing\nJonathan Miller's latest foray into\nthe arts is an exhibition on the\ndepiction of mirrors and reflections\nin painting. Cynics might think that this\nis Just one in a long line of post-mod-er nist books/plays/exhibitions; taking\nsome inanimate object and then spinning out a single trivial insight into reams\nof pseudo-drivel. In the case of this exhibition, the cynics would be\nwrong. In fact, mirrors have\nalways fascinated artists, not\njust for their entertaining\noptical effects, but also their\nability to give subtle meaning\nand dimension to a painting.\nCritics have suggested\nthat Miller is out of his depth\nin the visual arts and should\nstay on his more familiar territory of opera, intellectual\nmusing and corduroy jackets (sorry about that last\none). I disagree and think\nMiller's treatment of mirrors\nin art makes the subject\naccessible and exciting.\nMiller's talc covers various themes, tied\nin together with an audio commentary\nand a short documentary film. The exhibition uses both well-known and less\nfamous paintings as examples, reintroducing you to all those works you've\nseen somewhere but just can't name.\nArtists often paint mirrors to create\nsome quirky optical illusion. Ask yourself this question: when you see a mirror in a painting (or even a photo), how\ndo you know that you are looking at a mirror? Of course the answer is because\nyou see a reflection. This may appear\nobvious but the exhibition explains that\nif you blot everything out except the mir-r or, you can no longer tell whether you're\nlooking at a real object or a reflected\nimage. What this means is that the brain\nrequires a context to understand it is\nactually looking at a reflection. The classic example is Jan van by ck' s Arnolflnl Portrait (this contains the most famous\nmirror in art history in case you didn't know).\nSo on some level, the exhibition\ntakes the form of an illusionist's show.\nBut for me, the key message was that\nmirrors also add emotional depth to a painting. Miller comments that \"reflective\nsurfaces give us the opportunity of looking in one direction and seeing in\nanother\". He means this both in the literal and figurative sense. Imagine an\nempty Parisian cafe with its walls covered\nby gilt mirrors; the painting In a Cafe by\nGustave Caillebotte depicts just such a scene with a man standing with his back\nto one of the mirrors. By some magical\nprocess, his reflections imply that the\nperson is isolated and lonely.\nI could bore you with this stuff for\nhours, so the best thing is to go to sec\nthe exhibition for yourself. Aside from\nadmiring the beauty of the paintings\nand gaining insight into the minds of the\nartists, you won't ever be able to sit\nthrough a nine o 'clock lecture on chirality without a knowing smile. And in the\nmornings the simple act of staring bleary-eyed at your reflection in the bathroom\nmirror will assume a whole new metaphysical significance.\nWilliam\nUntil 13th December\nNearest tube: Charing Cross/Leicester\nSquare\nAdmission: \u00a35.50, concessions \u00a33.50\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm( Sun-days from 12pm, Wednesdays until 8pm) SPEED: VISIONS OF AN ACCELERATED AGE\nWhitechapel Gallery\nF rom the moment you step\nthrough the doors of the gallery\nand hear the continuous, disjointed ticking emitted by a row of\nmetronomes, each set at slightly different rhythms, it is clear that Speed is\ngoing to challenge the spectator's senses.\nThe curator of the gallery uses a wide variety of media, ranging from\nsculpture to photography, to demonstrate how the idea and measurement of\nspeed permeate our everyday life - and\neven how speed itself Is getting faster!\nMy favourite piece from this varied\ncollection was Rachel Lowe's video installation entitled A Letter to an Unknown\nPerson. At first, all that can be seen is the\ncountryside zooming past a camera in\nthe passenger seat of a car. Her hand\nreaches up into shot and she then\nattempts to sketch the scenery with a record all that is happening to each individual comes across very clearly.\nAnother work which caught my\nattention was Lime Works: Blasting by\n\\ago vall a take yama( pictured centre).\nThe artist has created a series of arrest-marker pen as it flashes by. Initially, the\nartist snatches small parts of the landscape onto the windscreen, but the\nexperiment quickly degenerates into a meaningless scribble of disjointed lines\nand meaningless shapes. The comment\non the fleeting ness of modern life and\nthe insanity of the current attempts to\ning images depicting a limestone quarry\nin various states of destruction. By using\nenlarged prints and high-speed photography, minute details can be made out.\nThis dizzying intricacy is the feature that\nenthrals the viewer - the very thing which\nthe average individual cannot attain in\nday-to-day life has been presented here\nin glaring colour and at a huge scale.\nWith many other interesting exhibits\non show (including wooden and hairy\ncars), Speed is well worth an afternoon's attention - just don't rush it!\nJoel\nUntil 22th November\nNearest tube: Aldgate Last\nOpening hours: daily (except Mondays)\n11am5 pm( Wednesdays until 8pm) Admission: \u00a34, concessions \u00a32.50 (FRLE\non Tuesdays)\n\n"

In the past\nthe JCR has been used, but the Director\nof Catering and Conferences, John fo s ter, has stated that in view of the recent\nrefurbishment it is no longer suitable;\nconsequently an alternative venue\nshould be found. One candidate is the\nUnion Concert Hall. Unfortunately, the\nspace and time needed for the festival -fifty different beers, ciders and per ries which take five days to set up and settle\n- mean that neither this nor various other\ncollege areas are suitable. RCSU VP Bob\nWalker, who is organising the festival,\nadmits that Mr foster has a point; the\nevent will cause a lot of disruption and\nmess. However, the JCR is the only\nlicensed venue large enough for it.\nUnfortunately, Mr Foster was unavailable to comment on the situation.\nThe problems with the Beer Festival\nwill probably set RAG week back until\nnext term, the Ie sti val usually raises two\nor three thousand pounds, a significant\nportion of RAGs total income. ICU Pres:\n... i.

He said, \"The JCR is a Union\nroom under the Memorandum of Understanding. Therefore it should be available\nfor use by the Union for an event which\nhas kept RAG afloat in recent years.\" The\nsuggestion lh at Catering should donate\nan equivalent sum of money to that\nraised by the Beer festival to RAG was\npolitely declined.\nBy Sunil Rao\nThe collapse of the 'tiger' Malaysian\neconomy has left many students fearing\nrecall to their home country, the number of Malaysian students arriving in\nBritain in January and February 1998 was\nalready down 50% compared with the\nprevious year. It is estimated that a similar drop will be noticed again next year.\nWith funding for students quickly evap-orating, reports have emerged of students being forced to return home or\nlook for alternative sources of funding\nsuch as scholarships. Moreover, it was\nreported in April that nearly 300 students\nhad applied to the td u cation Ministry of\nMalaysia to return home to complete\nIheir education there.\nBritain remains the most popular\ndestination for students from Malaysia.\nNearly all are sponsored. However, fees\nfor overseas students run at over \u00a310,000\nper annum - not including other costs\nsuch as accommodation, travel and\nbooks. This imposes an additional financial burden on a country already in the\ngrip of a major economic crisis. The\nMalaysian Embassy admits that a number\nof students have been sent back home\nbut maintains that this only applies to\n\"under-performing\" A level students. Earlier reports had indicated that a large proportion of students reading Arts-related\nsubjects or at less prestigious Universities\nwould face recall.\nSome Universities, heavily dependent on the large sums paid by overseas\nstudents, are anxiously looking to provide less expensive distance-learning\nschemes in franchise with local colleges\nwithin Malaysia. This has led to worries\nin some circles that the end result might\nbe a fall in the standard of the 'British\ndegree'. On the other hand, if rigorous\nstandards are maintained, this endeavour might give many students the otherwise unavailable opportunity to obtain\na world-class degree.\nA comprehensive website featuring\nlinks to the Asian Economic crisis can be\nfound at http://headlines.yahoo.com/\nFull_Coverage/World/Aslan_Economic_\nWoes/.

    "content": "Classic Commemoration\nBy Ed Sexton\nPhoto: William Students perfect their image for the official photographer\nRacism Rife in Medical Schools\nLast Wednesday brought out the gowns\nand relatives for Imperial's annual Commemoration Day, when the year's graduates arc processed in front of their\nconstituent college's dean in the Royal\nAlbert Hall. It was also the occasion for\nthe presentation of three new fellows to\nthe college,- Professor John Archer, Professor Nay Htun and Professor J Trevor\nStuart.\nthe day commemorates the visit of\nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth\n(now the Queen Mother) to the college\nin 1945. to celebrate the centenary of the\nfoundation of the Royal College of Chemistry. The afternoon began shortly after\n2pm with a procession of the Deans,\nPro Rectors and other dignitaries. David\nHellard, ICU President, opened the ceremony with a short speech, before the\nRector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, gave the\naddress. Commenting on the vast num-By Andrew Ofori\nThe name of London's medical schools\nhas been muddied this week, as allegations of institutional is ed racism circulate.\nThe medical fraternity has been stunned\nby the results of a new report complied\nby UCL's Prof McManus, formerly an IC\naffiliate, as recently reported in The\nGuardian. It claims two-thirds of the 27\nmedical schools admitting students displayed discrimination against ethnic\nminority applicants.\nThe report was commissioned by\nthe Council of Heads of Medical Schools\nas a response to rumours of racism,\nwhich have been pervading medical\nschools for over a decade. It compared\nthe proportion of ethnic 17 and 18 year\nolds who applied to the proportion that\nreceived offers; the result was a league\ntable highlighting the schools which\nwere deemed to show bias against ethnic minorities. Imperial College has been\n'black-marked' along with UCL, King's London, St. George's Hospital, Leeds,\nLeicester and Manchester, in contrast to\nschools like Bristol and Newcastle that\nhave emerged as completely impartial.\nThe table is to be placed on the Internet,\narousing fears that the selection of non-while students will be affected. One\nICSM student told Felix that a number of\nhis contemporaries refused to apply lo St\nMary's \"because of its reputation\". The\nMcManus report also revealed that male\napplicants were at a disadvantage when\napplying for medicine.\nProf McManus is somewhat concerned with his findings stating \"Ihe disadvantage of non-white applicants and\nof males would be construed as prima\nfa cie evidence under the Race Relations\nAct 1976 and the Sex Discrimination Act\n1975.\"\nVarious parties from medical academia have called the report's legitimacy\nin lo question, faulting the omission of\nfactors such as GCSt results, A1\nLevel predictions and the social aspect of applicants when drawing its conclusions.\nImperial College claims to have\ntaken the findings into consideration,\nbut states that the medical admissions\nprocedure is in a state of reform as a result of the recent merger. The college\nmaintains \"ICSM is committed to ensuring that its selection process is unbiased\nand appropriate for its educational role.\"\nWadeGayed, ICSM Union President,\ncondemned the blacklisting of the college as \"absolute horses hit.\" Adopting\nthe line taken by many of the named and\nshamed medical schools, Gaycd was\ninsistent that the admissions statistics\nwere a more than adequate contradiction to the McManus report.

    "content": "2 November 1998\nGames 13\nCarmageddon II - Carpocalypse Now (PC)\nThe name of the game really says\nit all, it's the sequel of the infamous Carmagedon. The objectives of the games hasn't really\nchanged; race against other drivers but for additional points you\nneed to do the unthinkable. Yup\nrun over people.\nAlthough in the version which\nI saw you don't run over \"living\"\npeople as such (well zombies in\nfact!). The graphics shows no real\ninnovation although using the\n3 Dfx card docs make the game\nrun at an amazing speed. At the\nend of the day; the rendering is\nflat, game play lacks any imagination and most of all the music drives you round the bend. Maybe\nit enhances the games by making\nyou want to run over more people\nso that you can complete the circuit as\nquickly as possible!?!\nWho knows!\nIn conclusion...\nWould I buy the came?\nProbably not... the\ngame tries to hard to\nappeal to the dark side of the players and fails\nmiserably... and as a driving game it's pretty much bog stan-dard. I rate it a poor 1 star. I would give\nit a0 star but because it uses 3dfx I thought it redeemed itself by at least\nmaking an effort on the graphics. Well\nalmost.\nBill Tung\nSin (PC)\nActivision\nHaving stopped playing PC first\nperson shooting games at\nquake I feel a little bit like a footballer that has taken a year\noff after breaking their leg to\nfind that the team has been\nreplaced by weird green\naliens, sure they look different but they still play pretty\nmuch in the same way. Perhaps nothing was able to dis- if tract me from Goldeneye on 1\nthe N64. Goldcneyc with its\nstrategy, sniper rifle and head h shot instant kills. Perhaps the\nboredom of the single player I quake without the eye candy \\\nsupplied by a decent 3D card\nbored me too much. Either /\nway was sin to reawaken my ^\nblood lust? So onto the story. You play\na cop. The bad guys are commanded by\na sort of anti-Lara. A big, bondage out-fitted, anatomically unfeasible, incredibly\nwell armed, anti-Lara. You go after the\nanti-Lara with an assortment of bullet\nspitting, death dealing weapons. It must\nhave taken them all of minutes for someone to think that one up, and highly\nlikely the chief designer has having a nice\ndream all about it at the time.\nSo off the story and into the game\nlike a mad vole chased by an escaped\nmink. Problem number one was the\nancient PC at home. So it runs on a Pentium 120 MHz , with a monster2 video\ncard at 640x480 and it only complains\nabout it at the beginning but for a slicker\nframe rate don't consider anything less\nthan a166 MHz Pentium ( I guess most of PC people at IC\nwill have this, but just don't even try your old overclock cd486 with this.) The game starts\nwith a nice helicopter level,\nwhere you can forget about\nammo levels and just waste\nanything that moves on the\nroof of the bank. The level also\nsorts out that the humour is\ngoing to be very Duke Nukem,\nwith baddies taking potshots\nat the local winged life and\ndiscussing their last killing as\nyour gun ship creeps up\nbehind them, the first level\nalso introduces the non-linear\naspect of the game. Blow one\nof the ad boards on the roof\nand you can watch it hurtle\nthrough a glass skylight. Wanton destruction is good you might well\nthink. Well yes and no, after the initial satisfaction has passed you might well discover that the ad board has broken one of the\nsecurity computers that\ncould help you out later.\nFinish the first stage\nand you get into a more\nrecognizable game. It is\nback to limited ammo\nand complete freedom\nof movement in the\nlevel, run around and\nshoot things that move\ngame. Except this time\nthe enemies can either\nbe pounded in their\narmour jacketed stomach for a few seconds or sent to Valhalla quickly with a bullet between the eyes. As the instructions\nsay if they're not bleeding they're not\nhurting.\nThere is also a small, with an emphasis on small, amount of puzzle solving\nand strategy to work out.\nSo does it take me from my beloved\nGoldencyc. Unfortunately with problem\none to contend against it's a very strong\nno. Getting round problem on meant giving it a go on a network using a P2 400\nMHz machine running exotic addons\ncourtesy of Activision and with this setup\npossibly yes. It does look impressive, has\nsome pretty good touches and network\nwise means you don't have to play\nagainst your friends using the same TV\nscreen (not so funny on a14 inch portable). Its definitely my PC shooter\nnow (though I 'll be looking at Quake2\nwith the expansion pack and Klingon\nHonour Guard next week).\nGS\nNews\nColony WarsVengeance\nI liked Colony wars despite what the\nothers said. The missions were a little\nsame after the while but the hype\nmachine is back with Vengeance (heh\nheh a pun). I ol lowing on from the six\nendings of the original, things have\ngot bad for the league and civil unrest\nand general disorder have become\nthe order of the day, bit like a house\nparty at 3am. This time you play\nMortens fighting on the side of a navy\nattempting to reunite the people and\nmaking sure they get the N52 home\nbefore they set off another fire extinguisher. It looks like its going to be a guess who your enemy really is game,\nas you battle through a new graphics\nengine using your 22 new weapons,\nwith 75 different ships and other bits\nand bobs. It should be out on the 13th November for the Playstation, and\nhopefully Psygnosis will lend us a copy\nto give it a proper go.\nCarmageddon 2 -Carpocalypse Now\nI'm not going to comment on the review\nabove, mainly because I 've not played\nthe game yet. PC not really up to it.\nOne thing you can almost guarantee is\nthe press are going to throw their 'Are\ncomputer games violent and the cause\nof all of modern life's woes'. Since\nSpace Invaders this story has been\nbrought up mainly to give free publicity\nand sell a few more games for the software makers and publishers and to fill a few more inches in games pages and I for one am not going to panda to the\nstainless/Sci publicity band wag gon and\nmention anything about it - doh.\nGS\n\n"

    "content": "16 Arts 2 November 1998\nANTONY AND CLEOPATRA National Theatre, Olivier\nShakespeare' s plays have always\nformed Ihe best British actors or\nso we are made to believe. And\neven if they didn't start with the Bard,\nactors always seem to return to him. This\nis indeed the case for Helen Mirren\n(Prime Suspect) and Alan Rickman (Truly,\nMadly, Deeply). They are the main attractions in this new version of Antony and\nCleopatra. Director Sean Mathias (famous\nfor A Little Night Musical the National a couple of years ago) has opted for a very contemporary ensemble. The modern design is well done; an amazing\nwooden set with panels going up and\ndown allows actors on and off the stage.\nThe fresh feel is slightly misjudged however and the directing lacks vital energy\nand pace.\nThe story is well known, centering on\nthe love affair between Cleopatra, Queen\nof Egypt, and Mark-Antony, a Roman\ncommander. They lead a life of pleasure\nand lust, surrounded by their court and\nslaves (a very lush evocation of that\nperiod!). Back in Rome, Caesar orders\nAntony to return and marry his sister,\nOctavia. Cleopatra is desperate, but\nAntony eventually comes back to Alexandria to find her. Caesar declares war on\nthem and Antony's men simply desert\nhim. feeling betrayed by Cleopatra, who\nfalsely sends a messenger to tell him she\nhas died, Antony commits suicide and\ndies in her arms. Cleopatra then also\nends her life.\nThe actors are slightly out of place:\nAlan Rickman just doesn't fit in with the\nimage of the passionate Antony - he\nlacks total drama and fugue. Helen Mirren just about gets away with her interpretation of Cleopatra. Even though she\nis not amazing, she does manage to\nconvey her character's self-centred and\nwitty personality. The rest of the cast\ntries its hardest to keep the interest going\nfor the three and a half hour duration of\nthe play and proves mildly entertaining.\nThe good points of this production\nremain the lovely sets and costumes, as\nwell as the final ten minutes that I found\nparticularly exciting and daring. A few\nsparks do fly here and there in a production that is overall quite boring and\ndifficult to sit through. If you have never\nseen a Shakespeare play on stage, this\nmay not be the best choice for starting\nout. If however you are a big fan of Mirrcn's, then you won't be too di sap pointed.\nIt's a pity that Sean Mathias, who has\nso often charmed and shocked spectators with his innovative work, has come\nup with such a quiet and slow pro duc tion.\nD. Until 3rd December\nNearest tube: Waterloo\ntickets: standby places available for students (check beforehand) \u00a37.50\nVIA DOLOROSA Royal Court Theatre\nAnother fantastic play presented at\nthe Royal Court a few weeks ago\nwas David Hare's latest, highly\npersonal creation, Via Dolorosa. It centres\non a visit he made to Israel and his experiences over there.\nDavid Hare is one of Britain's most\ntalented playwrights; his more recent\nworks include Amy's View, The Judas Kiss\nand the adaptation of The Blue Room\n(starring Nicole Kidman). This play was\nlike nothing else he has done in his\ncareer; a sort of \"one man show\" where\nhe stood alone on stage for ninety min-ute s, reciting his own story. He described\nan issue that he now holds close to his\nheart - the situation in the Middle East,\nand more precisely in Israel. As he himself says, \"no other problem of our time\nis rooted so deeply in the past\".\nHare travelled to Jerusalem to put on\na play, which he explained was a collaboration between an Israeli, a Palestinian\nand a Brit. He then proceeded to tell various anecdotes and funny stories, caused\nby such a partnership. Hare was often\nhilarious and managed to introduce\nhumour to what is, in fact, a very dramatic crisis. Having met many intellectuals in Israel, as well as a few politicians,\nhe visited the territories of Palestine.\nThese scenes were extremely amusing,\nwith people debating different political\nquestions over lunch.\nThe actor managed to explain more\nabout the Middle Easl - its history, its\naspirations and its difficulties - than any\nHistory book or journalist around, since\nhe had no preconceived ideas. He did-n't suggest any solutions to the problem,\ninstead leaving it to the politicians (who\nseem to have finally found some form of\nagreement considering the peace deal\nsigned last week). His interests lay with\nthe individual; the everyday struggle for\none's identity and culture. It was fascinating that he should select such a particular theme for his play, yet succeed in\nmaking it so universal. He showed off an\nimpressive gift for story telling. In short,\nthese special real-life experiences were\ntremendously uplifting. If this transfers to\nthe West End, as I have been told it may\ndo, I urge you to go and watch the per-form ance, as it is compelling and ultimately so rewarding!\nD. PHEDRE Albery Theatre\nI remember frequently studying\nRacine's work at school, sometimes\nvery fondly. His plays evoke the history\nand myths of Ancient Greece, which\nform such a fundamental basis of our cul-ture. Ted Hughes has just completed a new translation for the to nd on stage\nand I'm sorry to say that it's far from successful. Some passages sound horrendously out of place and the quality of the\nlanguage is very poor compared to\nRacine's original trench. Hughes has\ntried too hard to modernise the characters and too often completely misses\nthe point. It's a bit of a waste really.\nPhedre is married lo the King of\nAthens, Theseus. She is also deeply\nattracted to Hippolytus, his son from a previous marriage. As this love is forbidden by society, she lives in a continual\nnightmare of suppressed emotions. In\norder to rid herself of this burden, she\nforces herself to be dismissive and harsh\ntowards Hippolytus, which naturally\ncauses her even more pain. She finally\ndecides to confess, leading to the play's tragic end.\nAlive in the 17th century, Racine nevertheless raises issues that are relevant\ntoday. The pressures of society in general\noften restrict individuals by not allowing\nthem to express their deep feelings. The\ninfluence of people around us, advisers\nespecially, which can bring about disastrous situations. However the playwright\ntalks about incest without expressing his\npoint of view; he just portrays a woman\ndesperately in love with her stepson - no\njudgement is made, no solution given.\nThe original play is fascinating and\nbrilliantly written - only the company\nhas messed everything up. Hughes has\ncome up with a terrible translation and\nthe acting is mediocre. This is particularly\nsurprising since the cast is full of talented people: Diana Rigg, for instance,\nwho has enlightened the London stage\nfor quite a few years now, turns out to\nbe a particularly un sub tlc Phedre. She\nhardly shows any of the pain the character experiences and most of the time\nmakes Phedre look ridiculous. The rest of\nthe cast is no better. Only Toby Stephens'\nHippolytus manages to keep the right\ntone. Many people actually found the\nplay quite funny. Now, if the audience is\nlaughing so much during a tragedy, then\nthere must be something drastically\nwrong with the production. Old tragic\nplays haven't had a decent West End\nrun for a while and it's a real shame to\nwitness such a failure. The same company is also preparing Britannicus... Wc\ncan only hope for better quality from\nsuch potentially good talent.\nD. Until 28th November\nNearest tube: Leicester Square\nTickets: student standby \u00a310 subject to\navailability\n\n"

If\nyou're still in the period known as \"Fresher's Blues\" then\nwe've got two great events lined up this week. So forget about work and projects and other depressing topics and come down!\nfirst up is the Electric Cafe club night at DB's in IC\nUnion this Saturday (7/11/98). This runs from 8pm till\nmidnight and is absolutely free! The first one turned out\nto be a great evening. We'll be playing all sorts of electronic dance music, from techno to big beat; house to\ndrum'n 'bass. Perfect on its own or as a warm up for\nsomething later!\nTwo days before, on the 5th November we'll be\nhosting another Electric Cafe chill-out bar at Southside\n(the back room). It starts at 7pm and runs until closing\ntime! This is turning out to be a very popular event. You\ncan come and sit around and drink and listen to music.\nThe music policy is eclectic and more on a relaxing tip\nthan anything else. We played house, hip-hop, chilled\ndrum'n 'bass and big-beats two weeks ago. Special\nguest on the night will be DJ Darren Nesbeth with a great selection of breakbeat s! If you would like to DJ at an Electric Cafe event at\nSouthside then drop me an email (a. seth i@ ic.ac.uk). All\nyou need is an interesting record or CD collection. An\nability to mix is not at all essential. So if you'd like people to hear your favourite tunes, then get involved!\nFocus On Tag Records\n\"sound\" of the shop. The only styles that\nTag doesn't sell, according to Steve, are\nthe three G's Ooa, Gabba and Garage.\nTag attracts some the top DJs from\naround the world to make visits when\nthey stop off in fond on. Ritchie I law tin, Luke Slater, Mr C Kevin Saunderson, Billy\nNasty, Jim Masters and Darren Emerson\nare just a few. But overall, Tag is a home\nfor lovers of quality club music. As well\nas selling new releases from the most\nwell-loved and progressive record labels\nfrom around the world, Tag also works\nhard to unearth more obscure and often\nquality music into the house or techno\nsectors of the market. The first release\nwas In Da Jungle by Playboy (now called\nBoy due to threatened court action by a famous magazine of the same name!).\nThis EP proved to be a hit with many Djs\nand c lubbers alike and was featured on\nthe Kevin Saunderson mix album, Transmissions from Deep Space Radio on Studio !K7 records. Since then Tag haven't looked back and each release has done\nwell, helping to build the strength of the\nlabel. Regular artists include Ian O 'Brian,\nDaz Saund and Ben Tisdall. Laidback Luke\nFor those of you who want to buy\nquality electronic music in the capital\n(whether a DJ or just a music-lover), a common problem is where to start look-ing. Although some of the major stores\nhave picked up on the el c tronic revolution and now sell a good range of underground records, the best places have\nalways been the specialist independant\nstores. As well as the artists and DJs who\ncontribute to the continuation of the\nscene, I also want to write about the\nshops that sell the music featured in\nthese columns, starting with Tag Records.\nTag Records is hidden away in a back street in the heart of Chinatown, in\nsouth Soho. The shop is the baby of\nSteve Hanson and has been around\nsince 1991. This is good for an independant store. Many have fallen by the wayside in recent times.\nAlthough Tag has fast gained a reputation as one of the UK's leading hard\nhouse/techno specialist stores, the\nchoice doesn't end there. The range of\nmusic Is as broad minded as the people\nwho work there. Being a specialist store\nputs Steve and his team in the privileged\nposition of being able to pick the records\nthey want to sell and thus represent the\nTag Records Chan\nSkymaster - Murge EP (Offshoot)\nHollis P. Monroe - I'm Lonely (Wai\n(Stickman)\nPrimitive Urges - Translations (Primit\nChump - Vega EP (Tag Records)\nThe Delinquents - Breaking the Law\nMark Ambrose - Syline (Mmifunk)\nDoug E. Fresh - The Show (Big Hair Re\nd) Housey Doingz - Chess with Dwarves\nJoel Mull - Archipelago EP (Inside)\nDoodlebug - Loose in my Mind (Abni\noverlooked labels. Tag also carries a well-stocked back-catalogue with approximately 5000 titles listed.\nYou can search Tag's back catalogue\nvia the internet\n(http://www.tag records. co.uk). The website allows you to carry out intelligent\nsearches for records and even execute\ndirect sales. It is well worth checking out\nthis facility as it is regularly updated and\norganised into fully sera ch able databases\nconveniently labelled by style of music.\nNow Tag has its own record label.\nLaunched in late 1996, it is called Tag\nRecordings (!). The aim was to release\nhas also provided remixes for the label.\nSo if you're into music from around\nthe world that is defining hard house and\ntechno club culture then do check out\nTag Records!\nMark Callings from Tag Records has\nvery kindly provided us with a chart from\nthe shop for this week.

It's important for me; the two biggest kicks being making a pop\nrecord everyone likes, but also getting the respect of\nmy peers.\"\nYou've\nCome A Long\nWay, Baby is\nnumbing musical catch-phrase where no with their feet\n'He's a master of finding an\ninescapably alluring chorus or a brain-one would think to search for one/\nNorman Is very Intelligent, Mrs. Cook, but his\nattention does seem to wander at times....\nF or fifteen years now, he's been making music\nto serve all listening pleasures. From his career\nstarting 80's brit-pop band. The I louse martins, to the dub heavy band Beats International, to becoming one of the world's most sought after DJs and the\nforerunner of a movement called Big-Beat, a mainly\nEnglish groove that mixes hip-hop and techno for a dance-floor-friendly sound that often adds a human\nelement through cleverly employed, repetitive vocal\nhooks. Brighton-born DJ, Norman Cook, has indeed\ncome a long way, baby. Being the same person was\nnever going to satisfy Norman Cook, resulting in many\naliases, some\nbetter known\nFootball fans will\nget so much\nmore for their\nmoney when it\nis released at the end of November.\nFatboy Slim knows how to find a pop hook where\nnone exists. I le's a master of finding an inescapably\nalluring chorus or a brain-numbing musical catch-phrase\nwhere no one would think to search for one.\nThe Rockafeller Skank's vocal hook, altogether\nnow, 'Right about now, the funk soul-brother / Check\nit out now, the funk soul-brother,' was lifted from a record featuring American rapper Lord Finesse. Fatboy\ncould have easily gotten someone to sing or rap for it,\nbut the idea is to make a lead vocal out of something\nthat wasn't and make it so you can't recognize it... so\nhe don't have to pay for it! Well done!\nI lis current outing, Cangsta Trlppin', an old-school-funk-meets-new-school-rap/ska jam, is built on a narcotic\nhook no other DJ would have thought to use. The song\nsamples bits from DJ Shadow's Entropy and the song\nBeatbox Wash by the Dust Junkies.\nThe mesmerizing Build It Up, Tear It Down, like\n...Skank, manages to\nmeld a surf y, English\nthan others,'....in terms of musical talent, he's an rock sensibility to a releasing sin- techno arrangement,\ng les under obese piece of genius.' while In.Heaven is\nthe names of\nPizzaman [Pizzamania), Freak Power (who can forget\nTune In, Turn On, Cop Out?), Mighty Dub Katz (the\ndub anthem Magic Carpet Ride) and many more.\nFatboy Slim is, in fact, the latest guise of Norman\nCook. I le's not fat at all, but in terms of musical talent,\nhe's an obese piece of genius.\nI le's not a newcomer to chart success, having already had Top 40 singles in the UK under six different names including two number one singles. It was\nalmost three, but Tune In, Turn On, Cop Out peaked\nout at number two. Now, under the alias of Fatboy Slim\ncomes a new album, You've Come A Long Way, Baby.\nThis is Fatboy's second offering (well, third if you count\nthe club session Live From The Floor OF The Boutique)\nafter his hugely successful Better Living Through Chemistry, a tribute to his friends The Chemical Brothers.\nWay back in March, Fatboy premiered The Rockperhaps the most\ninnocuously dirty song Fatboy has recorded to date.\nConsisting only of the phrase 'Fatboy Slim is fucking In\nheaven' supplied by rapper Freddy Fresh looped over\nand over again, over a spare organ-lick and Fatboy's signature fat-beats - another example of fatboy finding an\nunlikely hook and milking it for all it's worth.\nThe album also manages to mix in samples of\nchurch choirs, obscure rappers and even childrens'\nauthor/former pop-singer Camille Yarborough on the\ngospel-funk tune Praise You.\nNorman Cook's production was never in doubt -producing every one of his own tracks and many more\nfor the likes of Bootsy Collins, Urban Allstars and feelgood Factor. I lis remixing skills are not to be challenged either, having already done remixes for Digital\nUnderground, INXS, Jungle Brothers and many many\nmore. It's no wonder that Muzik Magazine awarded him\nfirmly on the\ndancefloor\nbut with\nenough\ndepth, width and mirth to make things a lot more\ninteresting. From the momentous backward strings of\nRight Here, Right Now and the funny radio intro to The\nRockafeller Skank (no joke - this is a live radio recording from WBCN in Boston!) this is Fatboy Slim at his peak.\nIt features many more pop-vocal hooks than his previous album while still maintaining the DJ's lightheaded,\n....he's also prone to screaming for no apparent\nreason. This disturbs the other children and\nshould not be encouraged\nparty attitude and his facility at creating innovative\nbeats - Norman Cook in the I louse of Love (his little studio at his Brighton home) producing the tracks that have\nhelped put Big Beat on the global musical map.\nUniike the first album sledge-hammering on your\nhead, saying 'Dance, have fun!', this one is more\nthoughtful; you can listen to it all the way through and\nnot feel violated by it.

Clearly, this\nraises questions over the real motives\nbehind the referendum.\nI he entire process has also been\ndogged by accusations of deliberate\nwithholding of information by LSE Union\nsabbaticals. Concern has been voiced\nby many over the ignorance of average\nLSE students - only 28 people turned up\nat a debate on the issue held last lu es day night, and some spoke of \"only two\nor three posters advertising the referendum anywhere in LSE\". Indeed many of\nthose present at the debate had been\ninformed that it was taking place by ULU,\nnot LSLU. Furthermore, Beaver [the LSL\nstudents' newspaper) has been criticised\nfor its alleged bias in coverage of the\nissue - which included a clear recommendation to vote \"Yes\" in the editorial.\nLSEU figurehead Narius Aga blamed the\nabsence of an effective \"No\" campaign\non the simple fact that no LSE student\nwanted to run the campaign.\nWhatever the outcome, the process\nitself will have important knock-on effects\nfor all ULU Colleges. Whilst LSE may ultimately be forced to stay in ULU simply to\nretain access to their gym and swimming pool, those Colleges with their own\nfacilities - Imperial included - could soon\nbe looking toward life outside ULU with\nmore than just a passing interest.\nBy David Roberts\nIn a shock move first announced less\nthan two weeks ago, students at the\nLondon School of Economics went to\nthe poles last Wednesday and Thursday\nto vote on a referendum proposing dis-affiliation from University of London\nUnion. Although the result was not\nrevealed until after Felix went to press,\na 'Yes' outcome was strongly suspected.\nThe referendum itself has been\ndrafted by the LSEU sabbaticals and\nExecutive, and asks for backing to leave\nULU, provided that three conditions are\nmet.

The flowerbed, while looking\nundoubtedly resplendent, cannot be\njudged in the same category; it is not a student facility, though I suspect the Biology Department could conceivably find\na use for it. It perfectly demonstrates\nthe misguided strategy of Estates and\ntheir total mis comprehension of priori-ties. This morning, I stood in the cold outside the Chemistry building twice, the\nresult of an alarm system that does not\nwork, staring at an arrangement of Chinese granite\nand bedding\nplants, the\ncost of which\nwould have remedied the problems\nthat I and others\nhave endured for\nyears. Ah, but the\nflowerbed and\nother environmental improvements\ncreate a good\nimpression for\nthose wishing to\ninvest in the College, I hear you cry\n(from Suite Five).\nAbsolute rubbish.\nWhat might well\nhave an impact on\nCollege funding Is\nthe constant\ninterruption of\nimportant\nmeetings with\npotential benefactors caused by false\nalarms, which has already happened.\nPerhaps the Pro Rector (Research Contracts) would care to pose the following\nquestion to recent industrial donors: Did\nyou choose to support Imperial College\nbecause a) it has a first-rate track record;\nb) the calibre of the people is out stand ing; c) the research facilities are excellent;\nd) the herbaceous borders are a sight to\nSimon Baker\nVoice of Reason\nbehold? Gentlemen, I didn't come down\nin the last shower, and nor did the rest\nof Imperial.\nlan goes on to talk about the\n'appalling reputation with the local planning committees' that the College has.\nAgain, I am in complete agreement. I am\nno expert in local government, but I would suspect that the College's destruction of some of the finest Victorian architecture in London over the last thirty\nyears may, in some way, have contributed to the\nproblem.\nThankfully,\nthings arc\nimproving. The\nBMS is a superb\nbuilding, and has\nmade a very positive impact on the\nappearance of the\nCollege. Quite\nhow the flowerbed\ncan make any significant difference\nto the indescribably ugly Sherfield,\nBiochemistry and\nChemistry buildings is beyond me.\nThe College only\nhas itself to blame\nfor the poor standing with plan-ner s. This will\nonly improve\nas the quality\nof building design takes a turn for the\nbetter. The BMS marks the start of this,\nso I feel lan is being overly pessimistic on\nthis front. As for the implication that Felix\nis 'shooting us in the foot,1\n[from correspondence between Messrs Caldwell\nand Baker - Ed] I am, as a chief trouble-maker, terribly flattered. I had no idea\nthat I and my fellow word smiths had\nmore sway with our local councillors than\nMedicine Matters\nNick Newton\nT hose of you with good memories\nfor bad television will have the saga\nof Fallon from The Colbys and the\naliens etched on your minds. Well, a similar thing happened to me recently. There\nI was, writing the first column of the\nyear, when suddenly I was blinded by a bright light outlining the body of a strange creature. My memory went\nblank, but when I regained my senses\nthe first paragraph had been changed,\nsuch that it very closely resembled the\nequivalent piece from 1997. Very bizarre.\nNot to worry, because I have since got\nthe local priest to give my laptop the\nonce-over with a cloth doused in holy\nwater. The things I go through for this\nplace.\nThis article is taking a lot longer to\nwrite than usual, not for reasons of\nwriter's block, but more prosaically\nbecause my fingers are bloody frozen. As\nI am aware, dear reader, of your concern\nfor my wellbeing, let me explain. Two fire\nalarms within the space of less than an\nhour. TWO. Even someone as tolerant as\nyours truly is bound to lose his rag over\nthis fiasco. Admittedly, the ineffectiveness of the fire alarms in my department\nis about as novel as the news that Germany came second in 1966, but it bears\nrepeating as it links in nicely with the letter from my good friend, lan Caldwell. Mr\nC does not believe 'environmental\nimprovements are a waste of money.' I agree. All these years, he has fended off\nmy criticism, but that agreement should\nhave given the old boy a heart attack. I can think of many projects that have\nimproved the environment of Imperial.\nFor example, the JCR refurbishment has\ntransformed one of the most shabby,\ninadequate parts of the College. The\nSCR, which looks and smells like a substandard school canteen would benefit\nfrom similar investment, as would the\nMDH, though any change there should\nbe accompanied by a change of mant is time to have a rant against the\npowers of IC concerning their attitude towards student behaviour. I recently came across an interesting document that describes itself as the IC\ndrinks policy. A fine and worthy item to\nhave in Sherfield's already engorged\npaper-pushing bureaucracy you might\nsay, or if you are going to be rude you\ncould say that is it not worth the paper\nit is printed on. This document uses\nphrases such as \"moral duty\" in relation\nto student alcohol consumption and\nfrankly I am confused as to how an\nadministration that barely tolerates its\nundergraduate population would even\ndream of ant agonising them even more\nby treating them like twelve year olds.\nEither the students at IC are clever, in\nwhich case they arc capable of keeping\na lifestyle that they can tolerate or they\nare not clever, or they cannot run their\nown lives and really should not be at IC\nin the first place.\nThe situation of IC trying to control\nstudents' lifestyle was highlighted to me\nin anecdotal form:\nTwo hard working members of the\nmedics' fresher s' fair were told, when\nattempting to buy some medicinal vodka\nto stay their flagging spirits, that a bottle\nwould cost in excess of sixty pounds.\nThey then attempted to purchase a round of drinks for their stand only to be\ntold that they would not be served more\nthan one double per person per day. This\nlaughable evidence of censure by bar\nstaff could be dismissed, if it were not for\nthe discovery next day of the aforementioned document in green - the IC drinking policy: I decided, lor the good of the\nmedical school, to investigate.\nA recent former president of ICU, for\nwhom medicine was not a career option,\nwrote this document. It contains phrases\nsuch as 'moral duty' and 'welfare of the\nstudents'. Frankly, I am stunned, firstly\nbecause the College thinks that it has the\nright to censure anyone's right to a drink\nand secondly to put the finances of the\nstudent union in jeopardy by reducing\nprofits at the bar. The only answer is to\ndrink at sensible medics bars where they\ncertainly would not let the sobriety of\nthe Estates Division. I suspect that this\nwas a slightly hasty comment, for if it contains even a scintilla of truth, something\nis very, very badly wrong with Sherfield.\nWe have dozens of well-paid people\ncharged with project design and plan-ning, whereas Felix is a bunch of journalistic waifs and strays. Honestly, I ask\nyou.\nThe BBC is, in my humble opinion,\nthe finest broadcaster on the face of the\nplanet. In terms of quality, most of Auntie's competitors pose the sort of threat\nthat Vanessa Leltz represents intellectually to Stephen Hawking. However,\nrecent times have been less than happy.\nFirst, the defection of Barry Norman,\nthen Jimmy Hill and now the loss of the\ncricket; frankly, if Richie 'God' Benaud\ndoesn't follow the test matches to Channel 4, I fear for the stability of this co un try. Even Blue Peter has not remained\nimmune to the problems ensnaring the\nCorporation. The problem is that the BBC\nis trying to be all things to all people,\nrather than sticking to what it does best,\nsetting the standards for the medium of\ntelevision. I suspect if we scrapped daytime television- no longer needed since\nthe advent of Welfare to Work- replacing\nit with quality repeats, the money saved\nwould have met the cricket shortfall; the\ndaily oil slick on Kilroy exuded from the\npresenter must alone costs millions each\nyear to deal with safely. I understand\nthat Blue Peter's problems are already\nbeing addressed. Cost is not the issue\nhere, but rather the maturity of the pre-s enters, and the unfortunate consequences that have entailed from lines of\ncoke that Richard Bacon made earlier.\nThe Beeb feels that a return to older fig-ure s, cast in the mould of Valerie Singleton and John Noakes, should do the\ntrick. Apparently, their first choice for\nsuch an avuncular figure was Frank\nBough, but sadly his agent said that he\nwas tied up.\ntheir customers get in the way of profit,\nwhich is after all, the only way to run a business. Given IC's attitude towards\nhanding out money to students for activities that make them look good (i.e. they\ndon't), it seems strange that they further penal is e the students by trying to\nstop them from drowning their sorrows.\nEnough random ranting; I will finish\nby offering big congratulations to all the\nsports teams, especially the medics, who\nseem to have been doing quite well\nrecently. If you carry on like this you\nmight get in the national newspapers\nand the denizens of Sherfield might get\nto hear of triumphs.\n\n"

Then go to the cinema some time\nsoon. Just when you thought you had\ngot away from the Stargate sex scandal\nhere comes Primary Colours. It's slightly\nmore interesting than watching four\nhours of Clinton talking about BJ's but\nnot much.\nYou have a story based loosely on\nthe rise of Bill Clinton to the American\npresidency. John Travolta plays Jack Stanton, an American governor from 'down\nsouth' who wants to become president.\nIt is a film about sex scandals but it does\ntry to touch on some sentimental issues\nregarding relationships towards the end.\nThere was a promising mix of talent\nin this flick but the best was Kathy Bates\nas Libby, Stanton's lesbian political pro-te ctor. But then again, has she ever given\na bad performance? Emma Thompson\nwas adequate as the president's wife\nbut the accent wasn't up to scratch. Travolta eased into this role if not a little too\ncomfortably. He also looked remarkably\nlike the current Ametican president.\nThis film is classified as a comedy but\nYou're reading ic Radio\nit is more of a drama with one-liners\ndropped in here and there. When these\none-liners app eat they are witty. Don't go\nand see this and expect to get action or\na well thought out plot because it isn't there. This is more the sort of film\nrequired on a Sunday afternoon when\nRemind you of anyone.....?\nthere is nothing better to do.\nIf you want to know how 'they' get\naway with things but don't want to resort\nto the conspiracy theory then watch this\nfilm.rj\nHelen\nCOMPETITION\nWINNERS\nF rom the mountain of correct\nentries received for last week's Exorcist competition, only five\ncould be victorious.

OK, saying\nlb we're broadcasting is a bit of an exaggeration, considering if\nyou want to actually pick up IC Radio\nyou have to have a satellite dish the size\nof Wales and be sitting next to the Dj in\nour studio (if you want to try to perform\na miracle, try picking us up on 999a m).Ilo wever, our clever technical manager\nhas wired us up to all the kitchens in\nSouthside halls, as well as to the JCR\n(although it's not actually working yet).\nConsequently, listening figures peak\nwhen the station manager decides to\ntune in.\nI low ever, this is all set to change. IC\nRadio is currently experimenting with\nInternet Broadcasting, whereby we will\nable to broadcast to the whole wide\nworld, all from our studio next to Southside Shop (how exciting!). IC Radio was\none of the first radio stations to start\nbroadcasting over the Internet back in\n1990, but its potential was never realised\nand the project failed. I low ever, due to\nthe explosion of the Internet we are giving it another go, and are now broadcasting in Real Audio every lunchtime\nbetween 12 and 2pm. This will be\nextended to 24 hours a day when we\nwork out how to\ndo it. Although\nwe are initially\nlimited to an\nInternet audience of 25, if the\nproject proves\nsuccessful we\nwill extend our\nmaximum audience ad in fin i tum.\nIf all these\ngrand plans do materialise, then we are\ngoing to hold the mother of all parties to\nlaunch the venture- and you're ali invited\n(along with some of the big cheese\nmusic industry bod s, local and national\npress, and that blok e that got sacked\nfrom Blue Peter to provide refreshments).\nSo, if I were you I'd start thinking about\nwhat to wear.\nI was walking through halls the other\nday and it dawned on me that a lot of\npeople don't actually know what IC Radio\nis about, so as I have some space left I 'll\ntry to set the record straight. We are run\nentirely by students, for students (we\ncan't afford sab-bat ical s). Anyone can take\npart in the radio\n- you can get\ntrained up and\nhave done your\nfirst solo show\nwithin a week of\npopping your\nface in the door.\nIf your enthusiasm is more\ntowards the club DJing side of things, you\ncan get involved in discos. Despite its\nname, DJ's from all musical backgrounds\nare involved. As well as doing external\nfunctions (for which you get paid), you\ncan DJ in 'Ihe Backroom' in Southside Bar\n(free beer and pizza), and if you're into\nelectronic music you may be able to join\nAlick at the Union with the Electric Cafe.\nYou can contribute to IC Radio in\nanother way even if you don't want to be\ndirectly involved. By phoning 58085 or\n58100 you get a line directly to the radio\nwhere you can make requests for your\nfavourite tunes, or enter one of our fabulous competitions.\nAnother way that you can get\ninvolved is to join our music team. This\nis a group of people that get together\nonce a week to fill In the reaction sheets\nthat let record labels know what we think\nof their music. No matter what your taste\nin music you can take part - from jazz to\njungle, reggae to rock. People who work\non the music team get to go to free\ngigs, and get free CDs.
