His dedication\nto any task he undertakes never ceases to amaze me. Mark has\nsome radical plans for the Union-plans he has drawn up after\nwatching the Union very closely this year. Realistic plans that\nput the Union back in the hands of its students-not its hacks.\nVote for a students union next year-Vote Mark Reeves on\nMarch 6th and 7th. Andrew Jeanes\nMy election pledges are as follows:\nDrastic lowering of Bar and Snack Bar prices next year. More\nvalue for money in all Union outlets such as increasing the portion\nsizes in the Union Snack Bar. Putting Soft drinks at realistic\nprices. Southside and other college outlets should be radically\nundercut.\nVoucher scheme for clubs membership. The first five clubs\nthat a student join are free-thereafter a nominal sum is paid.\nProper action on student loans-not pussyfooting as has been\ndone this year. Co-operation with other SU's to organise sit-ins,\ndemos, parliament lobbies-whatever is necessary.\nUnion service for finding part-time jobs for students. Creation\nof Jobfinder scheme to succeed where the College Carreers\nservice fails.\nSponsorship deals with outside companies to fund better clubs\nfacilities, complete renovation of Union Building, more minibuses\netc.\nNegotiate strongly with College over accommodation costs.\nEither they bring down their prices or, we organise a rent strike.\nAsk St Mary's to join us on their terms.

I will monitor the current Dep./Ac. Rep. system\nclosely to see if it represents and protects students' interests\nsufficiently.\nUnion Finance\nClubs should be allowed to hold their own bank accounts (With\nsuitable safeguards), furthermore wherever possible I will\nencourage and help clubs to find outside financing through\nsponsorship or donations. This will lead to better and simpler\nfunding of Clubs and more money for the Union.\nMergers\nUGMs and St Mary's are here to stay and ICU should\naccomodate both, possibly by providing free transport between\nsites for UGMs.\nBefore a merger with RHBNC is considered further I will ensure\nthat the Union is informed of all the facts and that subsequent\npolicy is presented at all stages of the negotiations as it's vital\nthat ICU's interests are protected throughout.\nA Student's Union\nThe Deputy President exists to report to the President and be\nresponsible to UGMs for a number of issues and so it is you who\nshould decide the full policy of next year's sabbaticals.\nThis manifesto has stated part of what I would achieve as DP\nbut the rest needs writing next year when you decide what areas\nneed attention and what should be changed.

    "content": "Letters\nLoans anger\nDear Bill,\nFollowing last Saturday's mass march through\nLondon I feel it is time to assess the effectiveness\nof the current campaign against loans. So far, the\nmain form of protest has been polite lobbying and\nencouraging students and parents to write letters\nto their MPs. It is a great shame that the anger and depth of\nfeeling that existed following the disturbances on\nWestminster Bridge was not chanelle d into\nfurther mass demonstrations. This form of action\nis the most important weapon we have and with\nit lies our only chance of defeating the\ngovernment.\nSaturday's demonstration gave an indication\nof the number of students prepared to march, but\nunfortunately their action was wasted upon\ntourists and policemen. What is needed now are\ndemonstrations on a similar scale, but during the\nweek. By doing this our existence will be brought\nhome to those large numbers of people who are\nat present ignorant of the problem.\nUntil this happens students' demands will\nnever be taken seriously and the chorus of\ndisapproval will once again be ignored.\nYours sincerely,\nMartin Dixon, Life Sci 3.\nDistressed\nDear Bill,\nOn behalf of Imperial College Conservative\nSociety I should like to respond to your leading\nstory and editorial regarding one of our members,\nMr Dylan James.\nOn13/12/89 practically all of the publicity we\nhad produced for our Angela Rumbold speaker\nmeeting disappeared. Since many of them were\nreplaced by SWSS posters it seemed fairly\nobvious what had happened.\nTherefore it does not surprise me that a rather\nover-zealous first year was on the look out for\nany illegal left-wing posters. Mr James made a mistake and regrets tearing down a legitimate\nUnion poster.\nThat said, there are some far more serious\naspects to this rather childish fiasco. Firstly,\nConsoc does not have, and never has had, a policy of ripping down our opponents publicity.\nTo engage in tit-for-tat activity would lower us\nto the level of SWSS which is not very high in\nmost people's opinion. We are a well oiled and\nefficient society with many events for our\nmembers.\nWe are very distressed at how apathetic most\nstudents at IC are. We would love to come and\nlisten to a top Labour MP putting a case against\ngovernment policy. But the left wing at IC is so\nbadly organised, this never happens. We have\nno incentive for trying to stop a suitable\nopposition being built up.\nNext I should like to say how appalled I was\nthat Mr James has been both verbally and physically threatened. On the evening of 23/2/89\na note appeared on Mr James' bedroom door\nsaying 'Red or Dead\u2014SWP'. This is frankly\nunacceptable. It is the job of ICU Disciplinary\nCommittee to decide Mr James' fate. It is typical\nof SWSS/SWP to resort to violence and abuse.\nOne only has to recall the Battle of Westminster\nBridge, the Nurses Strike and many other recent\nsituations when the SWP has hijacked a perfectly\nlegitimate dispute.\nYour suggestion that Mr James tore down\nninety SAL posters is outrageous unless you can\nproduce some evidence to back this up. Furthermore your implication that every member\nof Consoc engages in such activity is equally out\nof order.\nYours sincerely,\nAl Roberts (DoC 3), Chairman Consoc.\nThe grapes of\nwrath\nDear Bill,\nA decision has been made by the UFC to no\nlonger sub sid is e the buying of wine for the Wine\nTasting Society. This decision is based on a ruling\nmade several years ago not to sub sid is e clubs for\nthe purchase of food and drink. At that time the\nReal Ale Society's grant was cut, however the\nWine Tasting Society's was not. The reason for\nthis was the fundamental difference in the\naspirations of the two Societies. Wine tasting is\nnot a Society for piss-heads\u2014not with one bottle\nshared between 16 to 20 people. We exist to\neducate our members and develop their palates\nwhilst giving them a chance to experience wine\nwhich many students (and indeed many salaried\npeople) could never afford. The price of a quality\nbottle of wine varies from \u00a35 to over \u00a3100, so\nwithout a subsidy the Society would have no\noption but to fold.\nOne of the major activities through the year is\nto train a team for the inter-university blind\ntasting competition. To date Imperial College\nhave won this so often we actually retained the\ntrophy two years ago for four consecutive wins.\nThe team is trained by having experts and\nmasters of wine from the trade coming along to\nlecture on wines from all over the'world. We also\nhave blind tasting competitions throughout the\nyear to practice for the competition. Another area\nof success is in the McCallan malt whiskey blind\ntasting. We therefore enjoy a high reputation with\npeople in the trade.\nWe seem to be left with no solution but to put\nour case to Council in the hope that this\nseemingly uninformed decision will be\noverturned. We are not asking for special\nattention, Wine Society has a large membership\nand should survive to provide an outlet for the\ninterest many students have for the subject.\nEmma Simpson,\nFiona Erne\nClaire Rulkin\nNick Battesby\nSam O 'Loughlin\nCompromise\nvaunted\nDear Bill,\nI was appalled at Neil Motterams opinion article\nin issue 829, entitled 'St Mary's No Thanks'. In\nthe article, he showed incredible selfishness: his\nattitude is 'We're alright, so why should we\ncompromise to merge with Mary's?'. True, St Mary's have their own identity and\nindependence. They would keep it as aCC U of\nIC Union. Our three current CC Us have their\nown Rag, clubs, UG Ms, policies, sports teams,\nsocial events and mascot rv, and the St Mary's CCL would have the same.\n1 dispute the claim that St Mary's would have\na disproportionate weighting in (their) favour'\non Council. As aCC U they would have five\nrepresentatives on a Council of 55\u2014one e' even th. By coincidence, their 500 students are one\neleventh of the 5,500 at IC. This is hardly\ndisproportionate.\nHaving read the minutes and proposals of the\nICU/SMHMSSU merger working party, I 've seen\nno demands to restrict FELIX, to hold half of the\nICU UG Ms in Paddington, or to give St Mary's one third of the seats on Council. Perhaps Neil\nshould state his sources here.\nMavbe we could force Mary's to merge by\ntaking control of their finances. I doubt it: if we\ndon't merge within four years, College will\nsimply force merger upon us, which is sure to\nbe damaging to both Unions. Anyway, does the\nfact that we could do this mean that we should?\n1 don't think so.\nName lo it held by request\nHolbein house\nof horror\nDear Bill,\nAs I was browsing through FELIX last week I noticed a few references to a so-called society\nRIP(?)Soc. It mentioned something about the new\nbreed of Holbein deviants and as a resident in\nHolbein I have noticed a few unnatural\noccur en ces. Large lumpy black plastic bags see rn to be strewn over a few staircases; can someone\ninvestigate? I haven't seen my roommate for quite\nsome time, although I have my suspicions that\nhe is the third lumpy black plastic bag on the\nstaircase of House B l.I am terrified that I may\nbe next. I no longer leave my room door unlocked\nas several times during the flight you can hear\ngroaning and sick banter which I cannot bring\nmyself to repeat as I am a Christian. I may be\nparanoid or naive but I think that something is\ndefinitely amiss.\nYours in-hiding,\nResident Holbein House,\nFG fay.\nPage 2 FELIX March 3 1989\n\n"

    "content": "News\ncontinued from front page\nRH B NC met last week to discuss the\nmerger proposals and, both groups\nwere against the idea 'on principle'.\nMr John Smith, the College\nSecretary, told FELIX last week, that\nthe merger could not be forced\nthrough against the wishes of the\nstaff at either College.\nThe working party found that the\nproposed expansion at the Egham\ncampus would prove difficult,\nbecause of the deeds of the\nownership of the land. Much of the\nland at RH NB NC is Green Belt and\nis maintained in the form of a trust,\nthe terms of which would prove\ndifficult to change. The main\nbuilding at RH B NC is listed, so\nexpansion in its vic in itv is serve rely curtailed.\nIn a joint statement the Rector,\nEric As h,and the Principal of\nRH B NC, Dorothy Wedderburn,\nregretted the loss of opportunity for\nacademic benefit but claimed that\ndiscussions had revealed 'areas of\ncollaboration which would be of\nsubstantial mutual advantage'.\nAUT join last NUS loans march\nOver 35000 students formed a two\nmile long po cession through London last Saturday in a final\nprotest against student loans. The\nmarch, organised by the NUS, was\nattended by students from colleges\nacross the country and included a large contingent from the\nAssociation of University Teachers\n(AUT). The event was controlled by\n500 stewards and 1000 police, but\nonly five arrests were made.\nThe march progressed form the\nVictoria Embankment to\nKennington Park via the Houses of\nParliament and Downing Street.\nBetween 60 and 100 students held\na 'sit-down' protest on Lambeth\nBridge but were easily moved on,\nand the traffic in Central London\nwas serve rely disrupted until late\nevening.\nA rally held at the end of the\nmarch saw speeches from the\nGeneral Secretary of the AUT, Young supporters caught by the atmosphere of the march\nDiane Warwick, and the NUS president Maeve Sherlock followed\nby musical contributions from a number of bands. Miss Warwick\ntold the crowd she was 'immensely\nimpressed' with the student support\nfor the AUT action.\nImperial College had between 60\nand 100 delegates on the march\nincluding all the Union Executive.\nSatanic motion dropped\nA motion on Salman Rushdie,\nauthor of 'The Satanic Verses' was\ndropped from the agenda of\nTuesday's Union General Meeting\n(UGM) following strong opposition\nfrom the Islamic Society.\nThe motion instructed the society\nto submit a written statement to\nFELIX condemning the death\nthreats against Mr Rushdie.\nThe motion was deferred when\nmembers of the society pointed out\nthat under the Union constitution aUG M agenda should be posted on\nall Union noticeboards 14 days in advance and that the Union had\nfailed to do this. They added that\nthey needed more time to prepare\ntheir arguments.\nIan Morris, Hon Sec (Events),\npointed out that the Union does not\nknow all the motions 'even up to\ntwo minutes before the U GM', and\nperhaps something ought to be\ndone to iron out this anomaly. He\nalso said it would be unfair and\nunnecessary for the Islamic Society\nto use this constitutional quibble to\ntake attention from the issue.\nMr Morris added that the motion\nhad not been proposed by him on the Union and said that he would\n'be pleased if no more indignant\nrhetoric about the motion was\nspouted in the Union's direction.'\nHere we go, here we go\nHustings for the ICU Sabbatical\nelections were held at St Mary's on\nTuesday and IC on Thursday this\nweek.\nAt the St Mary's hustings,\nspeeches were made by Neil McCluskey, Clare McErlane and Andrew Meredith for the post of\nPresident, Alistair Goodall, Gavin\nSpittlehouse and David Williams for\nDeputy President, Fiona Nicholas\nfor Hon Sec (Events) and Robin\nDavison and David Smedley for\nFELIX Editor and Print Unit Manager.\nThe same candidates made\nspeeches at the hustings at IC. In\naddition speeches were made by\nDoug King who is standing for Hon Sec (Events) and Andy Bannister\nwho spoke on behalf of Sez\nWilkinson who is standing for\nPresident\nMr Bannister claimed that Miss\nWilkinson was unable to be present\nas she had been abducted by\nDaleks.\nVoting will take place in all\ndepartments on Monday 6th and\nTuesday 7th March, but Geology\nstudents attending a field course\nnext week will be permitted to vote\ntoday.\nGuilds nick Reggie\nKings College is now minus a3 foot\nlong red and gold concrete lion. The\nlion, which answers to the name of\n'Reggie', is the Students' Union\nmascot and was last seen being\nescorted out of the college's Strand\nsite by members of the City and\nGuilds Mascotry squad.\nThe hectic five minute raid took\nplace at around quarter-to-five\nyesterday when fifteen crack Guilds\nmascotte ers, acting on 'inside\nknowledge' descended on the site\nand wheeled the soon-to-be missing\nlion into a waiting van.\nIC bomb threats\nFollowing last weeks bombing of\nBristol University by ' Animal Rights' activists a number of suspect\ntelephone calls, have been received\nin the Sherfield Building at Imperial.\nThe College has.received two calls\nin the last week which have taken\nthe form of enquiries from alleged\nstudents asking what type of\nresearch is carried out in various\ndepartments. Staff have been asked\nnot to divulge information over the\nphone, but have been sending\nprospectuses to enquire rs. The staff in the Biochemistry\nDepartment have been given identity cards and the possibility of\nincreasing security further will be\ndiscussed at a staff meeting next\nWednesday.\nCollege Secretary, John Smith,\ntold FELIX that the increased\nsecurity in the Biochemistry and\nChemistry building was mainly a result of an explosion last term. He stressed that the Animal House in\nBiochemistry per men ant ly 'poses a large security risk' and that the\nadditional security is therefore a long-term measure.\nWoman in strip shock\nA woman stripped naked in the\nsports centre on Tuesday evening\nwhen staff tried to evict her for\nstealing a purse.

    "content": "Manifestos\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT Gavin Spittlehouse proposed by Tom Yates\nPersonally and professionally I have known Gavin for some 18\nmonths, during which time his contribution to the Union has\nsteadily increased. From a very capable start within individual\nsocieties, his involvement grew to the point where he was\nelected Chairman of the newly-created Industrial Relations\nCommittee, a job which he performed with admirable skill. From\nthis background, Gavin now has a grasp of Union affairs\nunsurpassed outside the current Executive.\nHe will make an excellent Deputy President.\nProposer: Tom Yates, Physics PG.\nWould our bookshop, bar and snack bar serve us better by making\nprofits for the Union, or by providing better/cheaper services and\nlower profits? I will look into this.\nThe proposed IC/RHBNC merger would destroy student clubs\nand social life. I am completely against it.\nHall rent levels have increased dramatically over the last few\nyears, to pay for Fisher Hall. The agreement which lead to these\nincreases is coming to an end. We must consider whether we\nwant low rent increases, or would accept higher increases if it\nmeans more places in hall.\nOur Union building is a vital facility. It is unclean, untidy and\nin a bad state of repair. I will ensure it is repaired and improved,\nand looked after properly.\nCountless past sabbatical candidates have promised to\nproduce \"Exec News\". I make no such promise. FELIX is an\nexcellent medium for communication, which I will use to keep\nin touch with students. I want to see UGM motions publicised\nin advance.\nThe lecturer questionnaire is an excellent idea. The first\npublished results are due soon. We must ensure that\ndepartments use them to improve teaching standards.\nLittle has been done towards the SMHMSSU merger. It is to\neveryones advantage that it takes place smoothly and quickly.\nI will work towards this.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT Dave Williams proposed by Dave Osborne\nProposer\nMost people associate Dave Williams with Rag, since as Vice\nPresident this year he has led RCS Rag to their highest ever total.\nHe also edited this year's IC Rag Mag, which has proved to be\npopular both here and across the country. He has achieved this\nthrough enthusiasm and hard work-qualities which he has\ncontinually shown in his posts in RCSU.\nAs RCS Treasurer last year, Dave and his President saved their\nUnion's Finances from death. In this capacity, Dave also attended\nICU Finance meetings, and will have no difficulty looking after\nIC Union's money. Dave has also sat on ICU Council this year,\nand has considerable knowledge in how the Union runs. In all\nmy experience with him, he has been easy going, whilst still\ntaking the job seriously. I have no doubt he will do an excellent\njob as ICU DP, and urge you all to vote for him.\nDave Osborne, Chem Eng 111\nCandidate\nRecently we have seen the Union expand its services\nconsiderably, however this has brought us sabbaticals with\nminds set firmly on profit. People have forgotten that the job\nof DP is about services to students, whilst still keeping a close\neye on the balance sheet.\nI want to improve the image of the Unions facilities by\norganising a survey of students to find were things are going\nwrong. We must reconsider our bonds with the Southside Bar\npricing policy which artificially inflate our own.\nWe must renovate and maintain the Union building so it is a place we can all enjoy using and are not ashamed to show\nvisitors.\nThese are only the start of my plans, bring these and more\nto fruition by voting for me, the man who knows what it is all\nabout!\nHON SEC Doug King proposed by Andrew Garside\nIf I am elected to the post ot Hon Sec next year I shall do my\nvery best to drag the Union down to my level. I was brought\nup in the gutter and have sunk lower since.\nExperience\nI have no experience whatsoever that would benefit me as Hon\nSec. I especially haven't had anything to do with ents. However\nbetween me and a few friends I can muster quite a large tape\ncollection. I also know how to produce publicity on the cheap.\nThe Hon Sec is also responsible for organising the contact\nbetween the Exec and the students through the UGM. In my time\nat IC I have been to at least 2 UGMs so I have seen what they're\nlike. I have also watched council on one occasion so I know how\nlittle there is to do.\nTo sum up: If elected I will do as little as possible for a year and\nwill be useless as Hon Sec. But I'm the only candidate who has\ntold you the truth and not made any false claims.\nSo vote for me and I 'll do Fuck All for you.\nMarch 3 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

However, the game quickly degenerated into a violent scrap,\nlargely due to the referee's inability\nto spot, control or punish the\nexcesses of some players. The IC\ndefence, expertly marshalled by\nDave Harper, contained the\nopposition for most of the game, but\non the several occasions that the\ndefence was breached, Paul Bradley\nproduced some breath-taking saves\nto keep the goal intact. IC should\nhave had a penalty when Lee Davis\nwas quite clearly illegally brought\ndown in the penalty area, but the\nreferee remained true to form,\nunable to distinguish the difference\nbetween a football and rugby tackle,\nand waved 'play-on'.\nHOCKEY\nDomination\nIC 2nd XI\u20143\nIC 3rd XI0 The 2nds continue to dominate the\nUL Division Two, a point ahead of\nnearest rivals, St Georges. The\nscore line was clear-cut but hard-earned against firm resistance. The\nfirst goal came quickly, with Paul\nTurner stepping up to slot a penalty\nflick high and to the right of the\nkeeper after only five minutes play.\nAlso in the first half, our short\ncorner routine yielded a goal. The\nshot was stopped by the keeper but\nJon Beedsmore ghosted in to touch\nthe ball home.\nDuring the second half, the 3rds had one clear-cut chance when\nSteve Burton broke free at the top\nof the circle, but keeper Hari\nVamadevan saved well to keep a clean sheet. Max Michaelis then\nmade sure of the result scoring the\nthird with a shot from the edge of\nthe opposition circle passing\nthrough a crowd of players into the\nnet. Full credit to the 3rd XI for\nputting up a determined fight, but\nafter the first five minutes, the 2nds never looked back.\nSKI RACING\nWe like pain\nLast Saturday night, the Ski Club\n(soon to be renamed Masochist Soc)\ncompeted in the last league race of\nthe year at Hemel Hempstead. Once\nagain we entered three full teams,\nwhich perhaps reflects the success\nof the Club this year. Before the\nrace, the first team were in a strong\nposition ten points clear at the top\nof the table, but the second team\nneeded a good result to earn a place\nin the National finals.\nThe appalling conditions\nthroughout the evening made the\nslope more slippery than usual, and\nthis caused the first team to lose\ntheir first race. The second team also\nwon one race and lost the other in\nthe first round, so the teams were\nin the same group for round 2.\nUnfortunately the third team were\ndrawn against two very\" good teams,\nso they qualified for spending the\nsecond round in the bar.\nThe second round proved to be\ndisastrous\u2014only the first team won\na race, and that was against the\nsecond team! The final placings\nwere: Firsts 7th, seconds 8th and the\nthirds 13th equal.\nBADMINTON\nAll round\neffort\nImperial College\u20145\nManchester\u20144\nImperial College continues to show\nthat its Badminton Club has players\nto rival those of any other\nuniversity.

Our 2nd pair, Bharat and\nRichard, having lost to their 2nd pair\nmanaged to pull the game round by\nbeating their 1st pair 17-16 in the\nthird. Heros of the day were Trevor\nand S vein who, against all expectations, won two games,\nbringing the match to four all.\nBharat and Richard then went on to\ncomplete what should have been a routine win over Manchester's3 rd pair.

That was the question\nI heard voiced in the ladies' during\nthe interval of the British premiere\nof this new opera\u2014a reworking of\nShakespeare's Tempest. It was certainly hard to tell whether the\ntangibly enthusiastic atmosphere in\nthe Royal Opera House was out of\na genuine enjoyment of the\nperformance or a desire to appear as\nmusically sophisticated as the next\nperson. At the end of the initially\npolite applause swelled as the\naudience recognised the individual\ncontributions of the soloists,\ndesigner, production team and finally the composer\u2014Luciano\nBerio, who had also conducted. This\nwas quite right and proper as the\nperformances were well crafted and\nGraham Vick's, apparently 'wholly\nfaithful', production creates what\nthe stage directions describe as a 'Kaleidoscope of action'. Berio's music is modern, rich and intriguing\nbut is the opera a success.?\nWhen we hear do we listen?\nWhen we listen what do we hear?\nThere are arguably no more\nimportant questions for a musician\nto ask in an age when the act of\nconscious listening and understanding is ever more forcibly\nsubmerged by the tumult of passive\nhearing. Berio has made them the\ncentre of this, his theatrical\nextravaganza and in place of what\ncould have been merely a didactic\n'Walker'\nCert 18, opens late March at the\nGate, Notting Hill.\nHere's a new film from the makers\nof Sid and Nancy and Repo Man/\nThe story is true. Walker strides into\nNicaragua from the US and becomes\ndemocratic dictator for two years.\nAlex Cox has chosen to tell this tale\nin and odd mixture of parody,\ncomedy and cynicism.\nThere is a lot of blood in this film.\nIt is strangely beautiful; a surreal\nspurting blood and slow-flying\nbodies create a kind of ballet set to\nMexican bass-lines. The music is\nwell chosen: too hard for sentiment,\ntoo subtle to glorify the horror in\nany way. There are many of these\n'blood ballets' and they are all\nentrancing.\nSadly this talent is floundering in\nthe rest of the film. Cox succeeds so\nwell in avoiding any established\nstyles and attitudes that he loses\nsight of his own. There is no\ndishonest, cheap emotion, no\nglorification of battle, nor even easy\ncondemnation of America. It is not\nclich ed. But it is not interesting\neither.\nEven the character of Walker\nremains unexplored, rendered\nimpotent, for the most part, by\ncomedy. There is only one scene of\nscary craziness, when Walker cuts\noff his lifeline shipping supply from\nthe US almost to spite himself.\nHovering on the thin edge of sanity\nand genius, from whence the\npower-craze springs, this is a breath-holding, tant a lising glimpse\nof what could have been.\nCox sticks to his guns throughout,\nand edits out any more emotion.\nWhat a shame, all we have left is the\nvisual stimulation and a few laughs\nwith a cynical after-taste. Go home\nand make a music video boys.\nSusan Appleby.\nand philo soph ising drama based on\nCalvino's libretto he has created an\nenthralling, dream-like musical\nspectacle which circles around the\nquestions without ever an we ring them. So writes Nicholas Kenyon of\nthe Sunday Observer.\nAgreed, the evening was entertaining, the story is irrelevant,\nand no answers are provided. There\nis a constant background 'noise' of\nsingers, scene shifter s, ballroom\ndancers, acrobatics, a trapeze artist,\na woman sawn in half etc. (I was\nmes meri sed by a prolonged lovers'\ntiff between two mimes) and when the chorus took off (literally) it was\nsomething of a theatrical coup. But\nin the final analysis I am reminded\nof Rossini's comment on Wagner.\nThere were some beautiful moments\nbut bad quarters of an hour!'.\nVIDEO\nWall Street\nOliver Stone's expedition into the\nfast world of high finance and high\nsociety was one of last year's best\nfilm releases. The leading role is\ntaken by Michael Douglas, playing\nthe corporate raider Gordon Gekko,\nrich beyond belief and ruthless\nbeyond imagination.\nBroker Charlie Sheen aspires to be\nhis understudy, and gets a shot\nthrough sheer persistence.\nCatapulted into this crazy world,\nunready and incapable, he is always\ndestined for a mighty fall and his\nonly compensation is that he just\nmight be able to bring Gekko down with himself.\nThe supporting cast of Daryl\nHannah, Martin Sheen and Terrence Stamp help the movie\nalong, and the insular setting of the\nNew York business world gives a solid and bele ive able element to an\nexcellent movie. This film is\nrecommended to everyone,\nespecially if you missed it last time\naround.\nAndreiv Clarke.\nPREVIEW\nWorking\nGirl\nWall Street meets Secret of my Success\nin this comedy drama set in the\nexecutive shark pools of Manhattan.\nTess McGill( Melanie Griffith) is\nsmart, gorgeous and struggling.

But she is determined\nto use her brain and talent to pull\nherself out of the secretarial pool\nand into the-upper echelons of New York's brokerage industry. With the\nhelp of a white collar Prince\nCharming (Harrison Ford), she\ntakes a trip up the treacherous\ncorporate ladder, but all the while\ntrying to avoid her high-powered\nboss (Sigourney Weaver), a seductive piranha.\nA powerhouse trio of stars add\nzest to an already impressive script.\nMalanie Griffith (Body Double,\nStormy Monday) at last gets a chance\nto shine after years of mediocre\nroles; Harrison Ford tries his hand\nat comedy, and is rather good at it.\nWe'll see him in Indiana Jones and the\nLast Crusade in June; and Sigourney\nWeaver is delightfully evil in a Oscar\nnominated role.\nThe film has picked up a wealth\nof Oscar nominations including best\npicture.

    "content": "Science\n(f^ \u00a3 lj It is almost three years since the Chernobyl disaster and what has now been forgotten amid all the cries of\nOn the 26th April 1986 one of the\nnuclear reactors at the Chernobyl\nnuclear power plant near Kiev in\nthe Soviet Union exploded. The\nblast, however, was not nuclear: the\nreactor was literally blown apart by\nthe pressure of an enormous and\nrapid build-up of steam, showering\nthe area with radioactive Uranium\nfuel. The fire that followed spewed\nclouds of smoke and radioactive\nparticles into the atmosphere to\nspread and contaminate much of\nEurope. Even today, meat from\nsome areas, including Cumbria and\nNorth Wales, is too radioactive to\neat.\nThe Chernobyl reactors are of a type known as the R BMK, found\nonly in the Soviet Union and unique\nin being the only type of reactor to\ncombine the use of a graphite\nmoderated core with fuel held in water carrying pressure pipes (See\nbox). The fuel is allowed to boil the\nwater and the steam produced is fed\nto electricity producing turbines.\nThis is not a naturally safe design.\nA large number of safety systems\nhave to be built in to enable the\nreactor to shut down if there is a fault. If these systems are shut off\nas they were at the time of the\nexplosion, the reactor becomes\nunstable.\nThe fission chain reaction itself\ntakes place'in the reactor core, a cylinder of moderating graphite\nsome 12m across by 7m high\nthrough which pass almost 2000\nchannels running from top to\nbottom. The majority of these\nchannels hold the fuel and coolant;\nthe rest hold moveable rods of\nabsorber known as 'control rods'.\nEach fuel channel contains a thin\npressure resistant pipe or 'pressure\ntube', just under 9cm in diameter,\nwhich holds the fuel and through\nwhich the coolant flows. Inside this\nare suspended 18 long thin fuel\npins.\nEach pin consists of a central\ncylinder of Uranium Dioxide fuel,\nspecially enriched so that it contains\nmore of the usable isotope\nUranium-235, clad in a Zirconium\nmetal coat. The water coolant passes\nthrough the tube, from bottom to\ntop, to be heated by the reacting\nfuel.\n'it couldn't happen here' is that the accident was very much the result of human error and human error, like\nradioactive fall out, is no respect er of national boundaries. Jason Lander asks what went wrong.\nAver v human error\nThe control channels hold rods of\nthe absorber Boron Carbide attached\nat the top to motors which allow\nthem to be raised and lowered. By\naltering the position of these rods it\nis possible to remove neutrons and\nalter the reactivity of the core.\nIn emergencies the reactor can be\n'tripped', in which all the control\nrods are simultaneously and rapidly\ninserted into the core. This mops up\nall available neutrons and halts the\nchain reaction. In the R BMK it is\npossible to partially trip the reactor:\nthat is, to let the rods drop but to\nstop them before they reach the\nbottom if, for example, the fault\nclears. An operator can manually\ntrip the reactor in what is known as\na SCRAM. The R BMK reactor is not a naturally safe design. A boiling\nwater coolant is inherently unstable.\nTo use the jargon, the R BMK has a highly positive 'void coefficient of\nreactivity'.\nWater and steam have very\ndifferent properties: water is a good\nabsorber of neutrons whereas steam\nis not. As the power in the reactor\ncore increase, more water will boil\nand less will be available to absorb\nfree neutrons. With more neutrons\navailable, the chain reaction will\naccelerate and the power will\nincrease, boiling more water.\nWithout the absorbing control rods,\nthe reactor power and temperature,\nwould rapidly increase until the\nreactor blew itself apart. At very low\npower, near shut down even a fully,\ncontrolled R BMK reactor is\ndangerously unstable.\nEven with these inherent faults\nthe reactor could still have been\nmade safe. This the designers failed\nto do. The core of the reactor is\nenclosed in a leak proof concrete\nand steel vault filled with a Nitrogen-Helium mixture. Even at\nthe high temperatures involved in nuclear fission, these gases will not\nreact with the graphite of the core:\ngraphite which is required by the\ndesign to absorb large amounts of\nenergy. However if the vault is\nbreached, highly reactive Oxygen\ncan enter from the atmosphere and\nthe Graphite will catch fire.\nThe vault itself is not designed to\nwithstand exceptionally large\nThe RBMK reactor\npressures: it could burst under the\npressure produced by the breakage\nof a few pressure pipes.\nFurthermore, there is no effective\nouter containment surrounding the\nvault so the radioactive particles\nfrom the burning core will be\nreleased straight into the\natmosphere.\nThe core itself is made up of\ngraphite blocks. The pressure pipes\nare held within these blocks, nearly\ntouching the sides. If one of these\npipes is moved or vibrated, the\nbricks could move and cause\ndamage that can spread throughout\nthe core dislocating other pipes and\neven blocking vital fuel channels.\nThat is not to say that the reactor\ncould have exploded at any time, its\nmany layered safety system would\nhave been able to cope. The reactor\nwas designed to reduce power or\neven to shut itself down in an\nemergency.\nIf the primary cooling circuit is\ndamaged, the 'emergency core\ncooling system' (ECCS) comes into\nplay. This consists of three subsystems activated in two stages. It\nis assumed that if there is a failure,\nonly one half of the circuit will be\naffected and the first task of the\nE CCS is to provide coolant for this\nsection. Fast acting, electrically\ndriven pumps can spring into action\nwith 4 seconds of a fault occurring.\nThese will carry water from reserve\ntanks straight into the damaged loop\nand keep the water flowing until the\nsecond stage can be started.\nDuring the second stage the other\ntwo E CCS sub-systems are started.\nThese are designed to keep the\nreactor cool in the longer term: each\ncools half the core, like the primary\ncooling system, working with a large store of water and using\npumps powered by diesel\ngenerators.\nIt is critical that a high voltage\nsource is available to power the first\nstage E CCS. If an external source,\nsuch as electricity from another\npower station, is available, the\nreactor can call on this. If not, it has\nto find the power to cool itself from\nwithin itself.\nPage 6 FELIX March 3 1989\n\n"

It kills more people than all\nthe different types of cancer put\ntogether. Every year in England\nabout 150,000 people die of a heart\nattack or related condition. The\ndeath from Coronary Heart Disease\n(CHD) in England and Wales is one\nof the highest in the world.\nThere are several different causes\nof CH D and scientific studies over\nthe last thirty years have shown that\ncertain factors can increase the\nlikelihood of developing the disease.\nSome of these; such as gender, age,\nand family history are\nunavoidable\u2014others are not.\nCigarette smoking is now the\nmost important preventable cause of\npremature death and chronic illness.\nAbout one out of every four\nsmokers dies from diseases directly\ncaused by smoking. Lung cancer,\nand other lung diseases like\nem phase ma can be caused by\nsmoking and the risk of getting\nheart disease is double for a smoker.\nA sur ve v of 'the Heights and\nWeights of Adults in Great Britain'\ncarried out by OPC S in 1984 showed\nthat more than 30% of adults in England are overweight. Most\nobesity is not just due to overeating\nbut eating too much of the wrong\nkind of food. A diet high in fat, and\nparticularly saturated fats raises the\nconcentration of cholesterol in the\nblood which over a time causes\nnarrowing of the arteries\nconsequently leading to heart\ndisease. A low fat, high fibre diet\ncan keep weight under control and\nlessen the risk of CH D. Lack of exercise, high alcohol\nintake, high blood pressure and\nstress are also contributing factors\nin the incidence of heart disease.\nRegular exercise increases the\nefficiency of both the heart and\ncirculation, releases tension and helps control weight. Hypertension\n(high blood pressure) sufferers can\nalleviate their condition and reduce\nthe risk of CH D by cutting down\ntheir alcohol and fat intake, giving\nup smoking and increasing exercise.\nHaving looked at the causes of\nCH D many of us will realise that we\nare already at risk of developing the\ndisease in later life. So what can we\ndo about it? The answer is to try to\nchange to a healthier lifestyle which\nmight mean giving up smoking,\nchanging our diet or getting some\nexercise.

    "content": "Travel\ntl ^INDEPENDENT\nLAGER LOUT LAGER LOUT LAGER LOUT LAGER LOUT LAGER LOUT LAGER LOUT LAGER LOUT L AGE Club Lager\nMany myths have grown up about\nClub Lager holidays in recent years.\nFELIX sent a team of five reporters\n- Kev, Gazzer, Darren, Wayne and\nsomeone who could read and write\n- to the Costa Del Thug. Our intrepid quintet spill the beans on\nthe steamy image of Club Lager.\nHere is the diary of the person who\nwas foolish enough to remain sober\nthroughout the adventure.\nJuly 1st A journey of a thousand miles\nmust start with the first step and our\nfirst step was to board the coach at\nBasildon. Opposite the coach station\nwas the Boar's Head and this\nproved to be too much of a temptation for 'the lads'. After all,\nthey had to practice their singing. In\nthe pub it was 'We're all going to\nsunny Spain' and on the coach\n'Viva Espana'.\nGazzer decided to pass time by\nflashing his bottom at the drivers on\nthe motorway. Our spirits were\ndampened a little when we found\nthe airport to be packed and our\nflight to be delayed by five hours.\n'Right lads,' shouted Wayne, 'let's find some LAGER.' Everyone\nagreed that this was a good idea,\nand soon we were in a Heathrow\nbar surrounded by plastic foliage\nand cigarette ends. There were two\ngirls at the bar.\n'Flop your tits out darlin',' suggested Kev.\n'Whoooooaaaaaaahhhhh,' agreed\nWayne.\nBy a remarkable coincidence the\ntwo birds, Sharona and Tracetta,\nwere also going to the Costa del\nThug as genuine Flamenco dancers\n(from Barnsley). Ten pints later\nDarren grew a little bored - it was\ntime for trolley wars,\n'Here Sharona sit on this.'\nIt was really surprising how\nquickly a packed crowd can move\nwhen confronted with ten stone of\nspeeding Barnsley skirt. The Police\nwere kind enough to give us an escort to Gate 23, and soon we were\nairborne. Poor old Darren spent\nmost of his time handcuffed to the\ncoffee machine after making an improper suggestion to the air\nhostess.\nHaving passed through customs\nwith only a short confrontation, we\nclimbed into a cab and asked for the\nHotel del Clapp, described in the\nbrochure as having a romantic view.\nThe drive was surprisingly short as\nthe Hotel was twenty feet from the\nend of the runway. We were greeted\nby Senor Castrato the manager,\nknown by his friends as Fidel.\n'We are most aroused to welcome\nyou to our humble Hotel. Manuel\nwill be pl eee sing to take your bags\nto your room.'\nThere was no mistake about it, we\nwere all going to share one room.\nWe all started to create strategies for\ngetting laid.\nJuly 2nd Sharona and Tracetta were very\ngood sports, swapping beds at each\ncM rus of 'Viva Espana!' There was\no...y one shower between 250\nguests, so we decided to purge\nourselves of our dirty prod games\nin the swimming pool. We were\nfeeling a little thirsty, so we asked\nManuel to bring our drinks to the\nside of the pool and invited him to\njoin us. Manuel was a very shy man,\nand it tool a lot of persuading to get\nhim into the water. Wayne and\nGazzer put their point across very\nforcefully; they threw him in. For\nthe entertainment of the guests\nManuel then pretended to drown by\nflailing his arms about wildly,\ngurgling, submerging for very long\nperiods of time and finally going\nblue. What a good sport! Tracetta\nwas so impressed that she insisted\non thanking him in her own special\nway. That soon brought him around.\nAfter lunch, Fidel offered to take\nus on a guided tour to see the best\nof Tossermolinos. Our first stop was\nat the Tossermolinos bullfight. The\nlads thought that the bull didn't stand much of a chance, so they\ndecided to shift the odds in his\nfavour by throwing cans of\nTennents at the matador. This was\nan unpopular decision as far as the\nlocals were concerned - the Spanish\nadore their matador.\nNever let it be said that British\nhooligans are stupid. We never pick\na fight when we're outnumbered, so\nwe made a quick exit to the coach\nwhich rushed us away to the local\nvineyard. Here we were introduced\nto the fine art of wine- tasting. The\nguide demonstrated the proper way\nto taste. First he looked at the colour\nof the wine, then by swilling the\nwine around his glass he sav our ed the fine bouquet, took a sip and\nswilled it around his mouth and\nfinally spat out. Then he invited us\nto do the same. Kev found that the\nwine disagreed with his delicate\npalette.\n'This lager's flat,\" he cried as he\nskillfully spat a glass into the guide's face.\nWe grabbed a few bottles of the\nflat lager and made our way back to\nthe coach.\nSharona noticed that the coach-driver was Manuel, the mild-mannered waiter. He was such a good sport, even when we poured\nwine down his trousers and moon i ed at the locals, as is our\ncustom. By the time we arrived back\nat the hotel the sun was setting. This\nwas our chance to experience the\nextravagant Tossermolinos night-life. Fidel had some tickets to a local\nnight-club called the Bucking Bronco. The bouncer was our old\nfriend Manuel. He was SUCH a good sport, even when we made\nhim hop down the street with his\ntrousers around his ankles singing\n'Tossermolinos, Tossermolinos'.\nThe Bronco had made the mistake\nof selling Tennents draught at the\nbar. As the evening progressed we\ngrew very hot and had to strip down\nto our Union Jack boxer-shorts and\nWicked Willie T shirts. Sharona\nwas Miss Basildon Bust 1988 so she\nwas bound to win the wet T shirt\ncompetition.\nThe club was named after its\nrodeo machine. Late in the evening\nthe ladies, dressed only in bikinis\nwere invited to mount the beast and\nride. Timid Tracetta would only ride\nside-saddle but Sharona straddled\nvery capably. She had a pelvis like\na four-stroke diesel engine and could take the bucking longer than\nany other girl. Kev was still sober\nenough to find the speed control\nand use it to bring Sharona down to earth. The rest of the evening is\na little blurred in my mind as I succumbed to the Tennents. The\nnext thing I remember is a bewildered Spanish policeman who\ndidn't want to do the conga and his\nangry policemen friends who took\nus to the police station.\nJuly 3rd The prison had nicer rooms than\nthe Hotel del Clapp, but the gaol er had no sense of humour. He got\nterribly angry when Darren tried to\nde bag him. He ran out of our cell\nshouting 'Bastardas, bastard as'. Then he sulked and wouldn't even\nanswer to the name of Manuel. We\nwere very impressed when we were\ntaken out of the cell and driven\nstraight to the airport where we bought lots of duty-free whiskey.\nThe policemen seemed very\ncheerful when they saw us board\nthe aircraft.\nThe Costa del Thug is a lousy\nplace. Take my advice, and stay in\nEngland for your holidays. The lager\nmay be more expensive but the\npolice are more friendly.\nRamin Nakisa\nPaul Barton\nPage 4 FELIX March 3 1989\n\n"

According to the\nCommission Leicester have grounds\nfor private prosecution under the\nRace Relations Act.\nSimilar complaints have been\nvoiced by Keele University' s Students Union who have written\nto the National Union of Students\n(NUS), NUS London and the\nUniversity of London Union( ULU)\nasking for action to be taken.\nThe Staffordshire Area NUS Convenor, John Rushton has since\nwritten to Imperial's Rag Mag Editor\nexpressing his disgust at the\ncontents of the Rag Mag and at the\nEditor's 'Naiive and immature\napproach' to 'fellow human beings'. .\nKeele University have also written\nto the Editor pointing out that\nImperial College Rag would not be\nwelcome to sell mags at Keele\nUniversity again.\nThe letter complained that the\npublication was of a 'sick' nature\nand 'b latent ly offensive'. It claims\nthat the ICU Rag Mag Sellers started\nat a 'Ridiculously early hour', and\ndid not ask K USU permission to sell\nthe mag in the Union building. It\nhighlights as offensive, 19 sexist, 12\nhe tros exist,9 racist, 3 able is t,3 anti\naids jokes, and 3 jokes against\nvictims of child abuse.\nThe Rag Mag Editor told FELIX\nthat the mag was egalitarian in its\noffensiveness. He also pointed out\nthat rag had made \u00a382 from its sale\nat Keele and had sold a copy to the\nK USU President, who did not try to\nstop them from selling further\ncopies. '\nThe Editor maintains he started\nselling at 9.30am and said that he\nexpected some negative reaction. He pointed out that a similar reaction\nhad followed the publication of the\n1984/85 mag which contained jokes\nabout dead babies and the Bradford\nfire disaster.\n'We are not in the NUS and they\nhave no jurisdiction over us\nsaid.\nWhen interviewed by FELIX\nyesterday, Imperial's Rag Chairman\ncommented 'I don't think our rag\nmag is any more offensive than any\nother rag mag.

He concluded that it was\nboth the logistic problems and the\nlack of staff support which had\nprevented the merger's completion.\nThe working party which had\nbeen set up to consider the\nISSUE 830\nfeasibility, initially concluded in favour of a merger set for 1993, first\nreported in FELIX on February 3rd, but after further study announced\n' itself to be no longer in favour of a merger . The Universities Funding\nCouncil had pushed for the completion of the merger, but\naccording to Professor Ash, it was\nunwilling to provide the finance that\nwas required.\nThe initial report stressed that the\nlonger term advantages of a merger\nwould outweigh the short-term\ndisadvantages, but the difficulty of\nexpansion on Royal Holloway and Bedford New College's Egham site\nwould seem the main reason that\nthe proposal to merge has been\ndropped.\nHeads of Departments, at IC and\ncontinued on back page\n3 MAR 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Features\nAlternative accommodation: squatting\nThe alternative guide to finding\nsomewhere to live in London.\nSquatting\nShort-life housing originally grew\nout of the squatting movement of\nthe 1970's. Groups of squatters\nformed housing cooperatives and\nsucceeded in getting licences from\nthe local authorities. According to\nlatest estimates there are still about\n35,000 people living in squats in London alone (April 1987). There\nare now eight local squat groups left\nin London coordinated by the\nAdvisory Service for Squatters (the\nASS), which also publishes the\n'Squatters Handbook', an excellent\nsource of information and advice on\nall aspects of squatting.\nSquatting is unlawful not illegal.\nThis means that it is a civil dispute\ndealt with by civil courts. The police\nare only involved in criminal matters\nwhere something illegal has\nhappened. It is essential to\nunderstand the laws involved. If\nvo u follow some commonsense\nguidelines when setting up a squat\nyou will avoid many problems later.\nThe main laws covering squatting\nare contained in the criminal law act,\n1977 (sections 6 to 10). Squatting an\nempty premise which nobody else\nis using, nor intending to use, with\na few exceptions, is still legal.\nIndeed, the same laws protect you\nfrom being thrown out by force.\nAnvone doing so without first\ngetting a proper eviction order, may\nthese rights have to be worked for\nand are never really secure. The\ninsecurity is the main drawback to\nsquatting.\nThe first rule about squatting is\ncareful planning and organisation.\nBy doing the initial research\nthoroughly one can avoid many of\nthe possible pitfalls and you may be\nable to find good accommodation\nwith the potential to last a long time.\nWhen looking for a place to squat,\nbe realistic. As a general rule\nboarded-up accommodation awaiting development, previously\nempty for at least a month and\nowned by the council or by a housing association is ideal. A trip\nto the local planning consents office\nis extremely useful. Often this can\ntell you how long you will be able\nto live in a property. Planning\nconsent takes ages and, as often as\nnot, is refused. Hopefully nobody\nwill bother evicting you until they\nare ready to go ahead with development.\nToo many squatters go for smart\naccommodation only left empty for\na short period. Not surprisingly they\nare evicted quite quickly and are\nback on the streets. This shortsighted opportunism gives\nsquatting a bad name.\nIt is essential to ensure that the\nproperty is not occupied nor is there\nanyone intending to occupy the\nproperty in the near future.\nBoth situations are covered by the\nthemselves be committing a criminal\noffence under section six. In this\nrespect and for other basic rights,\nsquatters have the same\nentitlements as any other house-holder. They have the right to\nprivacy, rubbish collection, postal\ndelivery, social security and essential services like water and\nelectricity. In practice almost all of\nCriminal Law Act, sections 7 and 12.\nA 'displaced residential occ u pier'( DRO) or a 'protected intended\nocc u pier( PIO), as defined by these\nsections, has the power to evict\nsquatters without applying for a court order. Consequently, it is\nessential to make sure that the\nproperty is really unused or you will\nprobably be evicted very quickly.\nWhen you are sure that the place\nis vacant, the next thing to check is\nthe condition inside. Many landlords, and even councils,\nsimply vandalise empty properties\nby disconnecting the electrical mains\nand tearing out piping. They may\ndo this simply to enhance their\nchances of gaining planning permission. Local authorities are\noften reluctant to grant permission\nthat destroys living accommodation,\nso by vandalising the property\n, landlords can claim that it is\nuninhabitable anyway. For every\nproperty that landlords actually\nhandover for temporary short-life\nhousing, while awaiting planning\npermission consent, there are\ndozens vandalised in this way and\nleft vacant. Such properties are a shear waste. The cost of repairing\nthem to make squatting possible is\nnot worth the risks involved.\nORGANISE\nUsually for a successful squat a large\ngroup of at least six people is\nneeded. Move in quickly, change\nand fit all the locks, and then start\nfurnishing and decorating. For the\nfirst few weeks at least there must\nbe someone in the squat at all times.\nThis prevents anyone using section\n6 in the Criminal Law Act; simply\nbreaking in and throwing your stuff\nout. In effect, if you leave the place\nempty someone could squat you! If\nsomeone is going to evict you legally, they will have to go to the\ncivil courts which can take up to two\nmonths and even then it might be\nanother month before the overworked court bailiffs can get round\nto evicting you. Hopefully though,\nyou have found somewhere where\nnobody will bother you. Often\nf qi.Mters can come to a narr,e ment with the owners which\ncur. benefit both sides and avoid the\ncourts.\nMany people object to squatting\nas immoral and say that it is\nbasically a crime, that squatters are\njumping the house waiting lists and\nthat they are trying to get something\nfor nothing. Accussations that all\nsquatters are of dubious and undesirable character are common.\nSquatters are normal people who\noften, due to desperation, have\nchosen to act rather than be pushed\naround. The present system of\nrented accommodation sees many\npoor people having to pay most of\ntheir earnings to rich landlords who\njust sit back and let it roll in.\nIt is a greater crime that there are\nmore than 850,000 empty homes in\nthe UK which could be used to\nhouse the homeless. A vast majority\nLibyan Embassy squatted\nof these are in London and by\nsquatting they are regained and made inhabitable again.\nImperial College students have\nbeen involved in squatting before.\nIn particular, the mass squat of the\nLibyan consulate from mid-April\n1986 until late June. During this\ntime, around 40 people occupied the\nabandoned consulate until finally\nbeing evicted. It is quite possible\nthat if they had caused less nuisance\nto local residents they could have\nbeen there much longer.\nIn conclusion, both short-life\nhousing and squatting offer viable\nand cheap alternative sources of\naccommodation. Both require work\nand effort to furnish, decorate and\nbe successful. Whilst short-life\nhousing is a cheap alternative to\nnormal rented accommodation it is\ndifficult to get a place without\npersistence.\nSquatting requires good organisation. There are many\npitfalls involved and the insecurity\nis a major drawback. Many people\nwill remain convinced that it is\nmorally wrong. However, if the\ndrastic financial changes threatened\nby the present Government on students come to force then\nsquatting will become very attractive\nfinancially. Maybe large student\nsquats with a high public profile,\nlike the Libyan consulate squat,\nwould be one of the most effective\nforms of student protest. That is for\nthe future, but for the present, good\nluck in your search for accommodation, there is still hope-but it takes work! Think about the\nalternatives.\nMarch 3 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nRainman\nEvery Easter we have the Oscars, a time when movies are sold on nominations rather than cast. Every\nyear there are a couple of films\nhoping to grab more than a handful,\nprominent for a while, forgotten a few months later. Remember The\nLast Emperor, Ghandi and Amadeus?\nThis year is no different.\nRainman boasts eight\nnominations, including best actor,\ndirector and film. It opens today, in\na swarm of publicity, and while it\nmay well clean up at the Academy,\nit will be far from your mind by the\ntime you're lazing on a beach, just\nas its illustrious predecessors were\nin summers past.\nThis is the story of Charlie Babbitt\n(Tom Cruise), a smooth, slick Italian\ncar salesman, struggling between\nbig bucks and big debts. His character has all the substance of\nCruise's previous roles in Top Gun,\nCocktail and The Colour of Money,\nespecially his arrogance and insecurity. Here though is a guy that\nwomen would kill to have, and men\nwould have to kill.\nCharlie learns of his father's death, but does not inherit the three\nmillion dollar estate. There are\nevents past which have severed\ntheir relationship. He remembers\nlittle except that he was unhappy.\n'When I was a kid and got scared,\nthe Rain Man used to sing to me.'\nRaymond Babbitt ( Dustin Hoffman) is Charlie's elder brother,\nformerly undiscovered, and now\nsole beneficiary of the will. He is an\nautistic savant, a man of great talent,\nlocked within his own mind, his\nin comprehension of feeling and\nemotion, a barrier to the outside\nworld.\nCharlie needs Raymond to get his\nhalf of the estate. He also needs to\nbe in LA to rescue his business, but\nRaymond will only travel on back roads. It is destined to be a long\nand tiresome journey for Charlie, as\nhe attempts to cope with the present\nwhilst rendezvousing with a forgotten past.\nIt is hard to explain the appeal of\nRainman. Hoffman is superb and\nthere can be few complaints when\nhe walks away with his Oscar next\nmonth. Tom Cruise too is\nuncharacteristically proficient,\ngiving depth and feeling to a difficult role, and all the time\nemphasising the frustration of\nCharlie Babbitt: 'I think this autism\nis a bunch of shit because you can't tell me you' re not in there\nsomewhere.'\nThe music and photography give\nthe film a warm feel, and there is\nalmost a touch of Miami Vice about\nit. A good deal of close camera work, keeps the story intense despite an\nabsence of action and there are one\nor two laughs to relieve this tension.\nAcademy Award for best film?\nPerhaps. It deserves something, a few hours of your time if nothing\nelse. But it would be nice to see the\nAcademy mark Cruise's first proper\nfilm role, and Hoffman's best, in some way.\nRainman is showing at The Plaza,\nLower Regent Street.\nAndrew Clarke.\nEXHIBITION\nLeonardo\nArtist, Scientist, Inventor,\n(Hayward Gallery)\nAnybody who calls themselves a scientist or an engineer owes it to\nthemselves to visit this unique\nexhibition of Leonardo da Vinci's work. The range of exhibits on show\ndemonstrate the incredible breadth\nof da Vinci's interests, opening with\nan outline of his career through\ndrawings which relate to his artistic\nprojects, running through 'The\nAges of Man', \"The Natural World',\n'Body of Earth and Body of Man', 'The Vortex',' The Forces of\nDestruction', 'Art and Imagination',\n'The Measuring Eye' and 'Structure\nand Mechanism'. The draughtsmanship and beauty of his\ndrawings is quite breathtaking, and\ntheir surprisingly small size serves\nto emphasize the incredible\nintricacy\u2014the anatomical drawings\nare particularly remarkable.\nThe exhibition moves onto da\nVinci's scientific and engineering\nwork, but the comment theme is the\nmagnificent coherence of his vision\nof man in nature, and his observation of the forms which\noccur in nature, and the way in which these forms could be utilised.\nThe sketches of the inventions are\nrealised in well-made models, most\nnotably the lovingly made\ncentralised symmetrical church, and\nthe flying machine, which was\ncreated especially for this exhibition.\nThe exhibition also includes\ncomputer graphics on the\ntransformation of geometrical\nbodies, the effects of shadow and\nlight, symmetrical churches, the\nbranching system of trees and\nlungs, and the perspective of the\n'Last Supper', all supplied by IBM, the sponsor. These give a fascinating insight into da Vinci's thoughts.\nThis incredible assemblage of\nwork will probably never be\ngathered together again, and so\nyour \u00a32 (with a student card) will be\nmoney well spent. By the way, wrap\nup well; the exhibition is very\npopular, and a long queue is almost\ninevitable.\nMichael Kirsch.\nThe Big Blue\n' An existential comic strip' is how\nTime Out described Luc Besson's The\nBig Blue. The film is about two men's passion for the sea. Jacques\n(Jean-Marc Barr) is a quiet,\nmonosyllabic Frenchman and his\nchildhood friend Enzo (Jean Reno)/;\na bois trou s Italian. They are\ncompeting against each other in the\nWorld Diving Championships.\nPouting blond Johana (Rosanna\nArquette) provides the romantic\ninterest.\nThe scene is set in Sicily, Greece\nand the French Riviera and boasts\nsome of the most m esme rising photography to be seen on the silver\nscreen in recent years.\nA strong cast of happy dolphins\ncharms the audience with their\ngymnastics. The two men themselves perform superhuman\nfeats of staying under water for\nincredible lengths of time.\nThrobbing music, 70mm scope\nand slow motion sequences give the\nimpression of another world.\nThis film is powerful, melancholic\nand different\u2014a healthy antithesis\nof Jaws.\nLong after I had left the theatre,\nimages of The Big Blue still\nre verb rated through my head.\nA minor classic.\nAzher Abidi.\nPage 16 FELIX March 3 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nPaddington\nDear Sir,\nI agree totally with Mr Motteram that a free:\nmedia, a democratically elected, accountable and1 dismiss able leadership should be preserved at all'\ncost. Also individual members of the Unionj\nshould be able to voice their opinion at regular\nopen meetings. Why therefore was 1 effectively\nbarred from speaking (and for that matter anyone |\nfrom St Mary's)? That does not seem to follow*\nthe excellent principles enshrined in the ICU constitution. !\nIt is now impossible for all members of the\nUnion to attend an ICU U GM out of course\ncommitments. Therefore one has a problem. How do you ensure the accessibility of the Union on\nan equal basis? The present system cannot deliver\nthe goods, that is a fact. The crux of the matter\nis, how to alter the regulations retaining the noble\nobjectives?\nThe average Mary's student is unhappy with\nthe lack of thought or knowledge of the situation\nso clearly manifested at 'the' U GM by IC students. There was no discussion of the\nproposal, no chance to defer decisions until\nadequate debate had taken place. Surely these\nare democratic principles as precious as the Union\nrules themselves. I would like to see informed\ndebate within Imperial College with regards to\na merger as a whole.\nWith regards to 'all those concessions' that the\nworking party proposed, if you read the original\nstatement, how many advocate changes at\nImperial? Most refer to preserving life at St\nMary's as much as is practically possible within\nthe framework of Imperial, with reference to St\nMary's itself, the students here, our sports\nground and the Hall of Residence (Wilson\nHouse). All these alter nothing at Imperial. With\nreference to the section regarding the U GM, this\nis where changes of some sort will have to take\nplace, in some form or another.\nThe discussion regarding the merger of RH B NC and IC provides even greater problems with\nregards to the unions. How is the split site ICU now going to cope with the added dimensions\nof RH B NC students at their separate place of\nstudy, ensuring equal representation for all? It\ncannot, exactly the same as it cannot deliver\nequality of access to the students of St Mary's.' Thus something has to be done, ideally within [\nthe next year preventing similar problems with 1\nthe RH B NC merger.\nA Federal system of government works for ;\nmany democratic countries in the world. \u2022\nHistorical analysis will reveal that the federal\nsystem was adopted with the merger of\nindividual state governments in countries too\nlarge to be run from a central point. Imperial has\nnow reached that point, and will certainly get\nmuch bigger with future mergers. Transferral of '\npowers to the individual college unions is one J solution, if not the best. This is what the original \u2022\nproposal was all about. Medical students are i passionate believers in democracy, and are only i seeking access to ICU on an equal basis,\nindividually, not wanting disproportionate\nrepresentation.\nIf Mr Motteram believes in the U GM, why does\nhe describe 80% of the meeting as 'tedious1 debate' when this is what the U GM is all about, j Use of adjectives such as tedious suggests to me I a distinct disillusionment with the system as a whole. Yet he also states his defence of the U GM in the same paragraph. This rally to the cause so\neloquently and romantically portrayed seems to\nme to have a hidden message, such that St\nMary's within ICU as it stands would not receive\nthese much vaunted equal rights.\nAs an IC student I do not like IC UG Ms. Yours faithfully,\nWilliam Lumb, St Mary's Hospital Medical School.\nUnfair?\nDear Bill,\nI wish to complain about last week's FELIX\nwhich contained many inaccuracies:\n1. I was not 'unwilling' but unavailable to\ncomment. You only ak sed to speak to me once.\nI had already spoken to FELIX.\n2. Your article said I took down more than one\nposter, this is false.\n3. It said the poster had ' IC Union S CC Students Against Loans Month' printed on it, it\ndid not. It only had a very faint Union stamp on\nit which I did not notice.\n4. Your quote that I said 'Student Loans would\nbenefit everyone' is totally fictitious. I have a history of being anti-loans and I have printed an\narticle in the Conservative Society newsletter\ncondemning them.\nAs a member of the Students Against Loans\n(SAL) Campaign I was responsible for distributing a number of posters. I realised after\nI put them up that I had not seen an official Union\nstamp on one of them, and thus removed the first\none I saw.\nMy letter in FELIX last week is totally unrelated\nsince I took the poster down to stop the Union\nattacking SAL, not to oppose S AL.I asked to\nhave the letter removed since it only confused\nthe event.\nI feel FELIX owes me an apology.\nYours sincerely,\nDylan James, Maths 2.\nSelfish brats?\nDear Bill,\nI'm glad to see that Stephen McKeever can state\nwith such certainty that 'everyone has the right\nto free Higher Education'. However, may I inform Mr McKeeer that his Higher Education is\nmost certainly not free, it is paid for out of the\npocket of the taxpayer.\nNow I'm sure that Mr McKeever and friends\nwould say that this is a good thing because\n'society' will receive some benefit from his\neducation and anyway in a few years he will be\npaying more taxes than most because he will be\nearning more than most people. However, I'm also sure that Mr McKeever did not come to\nImperial out of some great wish to benefit\n'society', he came here for his own benefit, and\nmay I also point out that the vast majority of tax\nis collected from taxpayers who have never\nreceived the benefits of Higher Education and\nwho will never earn as much as Mr McKeever.\nI would therefore like to take this opportunity\nto challenge anyone, particularly those fine and\nupstanding group of individuals SAL and SWSS,\nto defend this redistribution of wealth from low\nincome earners to the middle and upper class\nfamilies who are the primary benefactors of\nHigher Education.\nYours sincerely,\nAshley Unitt,' DoC 3.\nGod's wrong!\nDear FELIX,\nDave Thomas (FELIX 827) is clearly unaware\nof the concept of metaphor. This is somewhat\nstrange, since he claims to be a Christian, and\nJesus generally used metaphors to put across his\nmessage. When one looks at the parables, fables\nand riddles which delighted the ancient world,\none sees that the use of allegory came naturally\nto our predecessors. In fact, Biblical scholars from\nearliest times have had no difficulty in seeing the\nCreation story as an allegory; to insist on its literal\ntruth is either to show a great perversity, or to\ndemonstrate a profound lack of imagination\n(perhaps this is why 'fundamentalist' Christianity\nappeals so much to science students and\nAmericans...).\nHow else would God have created the world,\nexcept by directing its gradual evolution? To me,\nthe Creationists demean God by their crudeness.\nIf Dave Thomas cannot see the hand of God at\nwork in evolution, then I suspect he is really some\nsort of atheist who has erected his literal\ninterpretation of the Bible as an idol in God's place.\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Huntbach, DoC.\nFornication\nDear Bill,\nOnce again I believe that we are witnessing a misuse of the ICU machinery. What on earth are\nS CC up to campaigning on behalf of the anti-loans group? Where is the mandate for an\nadministrative body of ICU to adopt political\ncauses? Did they have a Peace-thru-NATO month\nor an anti-NUS month or aproN US month?\nI am not denying the right of students to\ncampaign politically (in fact I would encourage\nmore political awareness at College) but only\nthrough the appropriate means. The acting\nchairman of the anti-loans group has complained\nabout the time taken to establish an S CC society.\nThe solution to this is surely to streamline the\nbureaucracy of S CC, not for them to undertake\nthe work of a society as they see fit.\nTo cover myself from getting irrelevant replies\nto this letter I wish to state that Iam not\nquestioning the competence of the S CC exec. Nor\nam I denying anyone free speech or the\nopportunity to campaign effectively as long as they\noperate under their o ivn banner, not the Water Polo\nClub, not ICU and not S CC.

    "content": "Elections\nAn idiot's guide to STV\nSTV is the favoured form of PR for the SLD and the SDP and is used by the recently merged\nICU/SMHMSSU in their elections. Confused? Read on.\nYou will no doubt be aware by now\nthat on the 6th and 7th March,\nvoting will take place to decide who\nwill represent Imperial College\nUnion as sabbatical officers next\nyear.\nICU uses a system of voting much\nsought after by a certain political\nparty; that of the Single Transferable\nvote (STV). This year, the forces of\nevil have conspired to land me with\nfive candidates for President which,\nas vo u will see as I explain the\ncounting procedure, will be an\nabsolute bummer. There are two\ncandidates each for Honorary\nSecretary and FELIX Editor and\nthree for Deputy President.\nHow to vote\nBallot boxes will be situated around\nthe College and all you need to vote\nis your Union card. Your name will\nbe checked against the College\nregister and your Union Card will\nbe punched (not by a fist). There will\nbe a slip of paper for each candidacy\nand your first preference should be\nindicated with a'V in the first box.\nThis year, a new addition is the\nprovision of a space on the voting\nslip for New Election. A preference\nfor New Election should be\nindicated if you feel that none of the\ncandidates is suitable and wish that\nnominations should be re-opened.\nExamples of first preference:\nCANDIDATE A CANDIDATE B CANDIDATE C1 CANDIDATE D CANDIDATE E NEW ELECTION CANDIDATE A CANDIDATE B NEW ELECTION1 Further preferences can be indicated\nup to the number of candidates\nstanding plus one. Preferences must\nbe consecutive, ie if you wish to\nexpress a third preference, you must\nhave expressed a second and first\npreference. It is not necessary to\nexpress a preference for each and\nevery candidate.\nExamples of further preferences:\nCANDIDATE A2 CANDIDATE B3 CANDIDATE CI CANDIDATE D lr\nCANDIDATE Eb NEW ELECTION5 CANDIDATE A3 CANDIDATE B CANDIDATE Ci CANDIDATE D CANDIDATE E2 NEW ELECTION CANDIDATE A CANDIDATE Bi NEW ELECTION1 How does STV work?\nSTV revolves around the\npreferences indicated after the first\none. For example, if you felt that\nonly two candidates could do the\njob well out of those standing then\nyou might express them as 1st and\n2nd preference then choose New Election as third preference.\nWhen the votes are counted the\ntotal number of valid papers (see\nlater) is divided by two and\nincreased b v one (ignoring\nfractions). This number is called\n'quota'. If any candidate passes\nquota after counting the first\npreferences, he/she is deemed\nelected. If no candidate reaches\nquota, the candidate with the lowest\nnumber of votes is excluded. Their\nvotes are then transferred in accordance with any second\npreferences expressed to the\nremaining candidate as relevant.\nPapers expressing only first\npreference votes for the excluded\ncandidate are not transferred and\nthe total number of votes to be\nconsidered is decreased by the\nnumber of such votes, thus\nlowering quota. The total votes (first\npreference and transferred votes)\nare then considered and if any\nexceed the ' new' quota, that\ncandidate is elected. If quota is not\nthen reached by any candidate, the\ncandidate with the lowest in the\nround is excluded and their votes\ntransferred as above with respect to\nthird preferences cast.\nThis procedure is repeated as\nnecessary until a candidate reaches\nthe value of quota for a particular\nround.\nValid Papers\nIn previous years, abstention has\nbeen available and registered by\nwriting Abstain across the ballot\npaper. This has been replaced by\nNew Election and any papers\nmarked for Abstain will be counted\nas 'Invalid'.

After the\nsteam supply is shut off and they\nstart to run down, the turbines will\nspin fast enough to supply power to\nthe first stage E CCS for 45 to 50\nseconds.\nThe generators at Chernobyl\nreactor number 4 had just been\nmodified to try and increase this\ntime and it is because of mistakes\nmade in tests on the modification\nthat the reactor exploded.\nThe accident at Chernobyl was the\nculmination of a series of mistakes\nand miscalculations which has\nbegun some 24 hours earlier with a test on the E CCS. The reactor was\ndue to be shut-down temporarily for\nmaintenance, and it was decided to\ntake this opportunity to see how the\nrecently redesigned turbine-generators could work the first stage\nE CCS. The test instructions are said\nto have been poor.\nOver the next twelve hours, the\noperators reduced the core thermal\npower output, initially 32 000 MW by half and reset the reactor to work\njust one generator. Then, as\napparently instructed by the test\nprocedure, they turned off the\nE CCS and several other safety\nsystems. There followed a nine hour\ndelay as the plant was brought in to\ncope with a sudden surge in electricity demand. During this\ntime, a different operator shift,\npossibly less aware of the test\nconditions, clocked in.\nWhen the reactor came off stream,\nthe new operators resumed the test.\nThey set up an automatic control\nsystem to halve the power again.\nHowever, whoever set up the\nsystem badly miscalculated, and the\ncore power output dropped to a mere 30 MW, under 1% of the\noriginal power and well below the\nlevel at which the power coefficient\nbecomes highly positive. The reactor\nwould have become unstable.\nSuch a rapid reduction of power\nnaturally led to a build up of\nabsorbing Xenon which had not had\nthe time to be removed or to\ndecay.This reduced the react iv itv but also made the reactor much less\neasy to control.\nThe operators started to withdraw\ncontrol rods and succeeded in\nincreasing the power to the safer\nlevel of 200 MW. But because of the\nextra Xenon, the rods had to be\nwithdrawn further than usual.\nNobody knows wh v the operators\ndid what they did next: they turned\non all the working and reserve\ncoolant pumps and greatly\nincreased the water flow to almost\na ton a minute, fast enough to\nvibrate the pipes and damage the\ncore. They also disabled safety\nsystems designed to force a shut\ndown in the event of a major\npressure drop.\nThe final two minutes\nThe pressure did drop and with\nit the reactivity as the enormous\nvolume of water flowing started to\ntake effect. As the pressure\ndropped, the water level in the\nsteam drums dropped. Cooling\nwater was diverted to top them up\nand this worked its wav to the core\nfurther reducing the reactivity. By\nnow all the control rods were out of\nthe core.\nTo increase the volume of steam\nand increase the react iv itv and\npower, the operators slowed the\ncoolant flow and shut off steam\nrelease valves. Half a minute later\nsteam started to build up and\nautomatic control rods began to\nIt has been observed experimentally\nthat the mass of a nucleus is less-than the sum of the masses of its\nparts. For example, and atom of\nCarbon-12 (six protons, six neutrons) is less massive than six\nsingle protons and six single\nneutrons. The difference is due to\nthe 'binding energy'. This is the\nenergy needed to force the\nconstituent 'nucleons' in an atomic\nnucleus apart. It is a measure of how\nmuch unused or potential energy is\navailable within the nucleus: the\nmore 'spare' energy there is, the less\nneeds to be added to separate the\nnucleons.\nVery light and very heavy nuclei\ntend to be more weakly bound: they\nhold more spare energy than\nnucleus into two some of this\nenergy can be released The former\nprocess is nuclear fusion, the latter,\nnuclear fission - the basis for all\nviable n ns.\n\u2022\ndrop. Much ot the Xenon had been\nwashed out of the sv stem and the\npower started to rise.\nIt did not stop rising, although the\ncontrol room seemed unaware of\nthis, and the decision was taken to\nfinish the test and cut off steam to\nthe turbine. This caused an increase\nin pressure, some of the steam\ncondensed and the reactivity\ndropped. Again automated control\nrods withdrew to co nter act this and\nthen dropped almost immediately\nas steam again stated to build up.\nIt continued to build up and the core\nstarted to rapidly warm.\nThe SCRAM button was pressed\nbut it was too late: too man v control\nrods were too far from the core and\nsome of those that were not jammed\nin distorted channels. The pressure\nbuild up was so great that it shut\none-way valves in the cooling\nsystem. No more cooling water\ncould reach the core. What was\nalready there eve po rated and the\ncore reached 100 times its safe\nmaximum power. The pressure\nbuild up blew pressure tubes and\nthe inadequate vault apart and left\nthe World with its worst ever\nnuclear disaster.\nJason Lander\nSplitting the atom\nand the available, fission able fuel\natoms, for example Uranium-235,\nallowed to release energy naturally\nby decaying into smaller particles:\nthe process would be too slow to be\nusable. Atomic fission has to be\nartificially speeded up.\nFission reactors take advantage of\nthe fact that while Uranium-235 is\ncomparatively stable, the heavier\nand much rarer isotope\nUranium-236 is not, and will decay\nrapidly releasing its energy in the\nform of fast neutrons. To produce\nuseful power, the lighter isotope\nmust be converted into a heavier\nme by bombardment with slow\nmoving neutrons.\nA chain reaction can be set up. Uranium-236 can be produced by bombarding atoms of Uranium-235\nwith the neutrons produced in\nUranium-236 decays. What is\nneeded is some means of slowing\nthe neutrons from the decay\nsufficiently for them to be absorbed.\nThis is achieved with a material\nknown as a moderator which is-dense enough to interact with the\nneutrons but stable enough not to\nabsorb a significant number. Graphite, used in the R BMK, is by\nfar the most common example.\nIt must be possible to control the\nreaction. Here, some form of\nabsorber is used. This is a material,\nsuch as Boron, that can readily\naccept excess neutrons. By changing\nthe amount of absorber, it is possible\nto vary the number of neutrons ' in circulation' and increase of decrease\nthe reactors ability to sustain a reaction, or 'reactivity'. A higher\nreactivity means a greater power\noutput. Xenon,- one of the byproducts of Uranium fission also has\nabsorbing properties and, if allowed\nto build up can slow or even halt a reaction.\nThe heat generated by the fission\nhas to be, removed. \u2022 Not surprisingly, this is done by a coolant In the R BMK, the coolant\nis light water ( ' H,0) which also has\nthe properties of a moderator and an\nabsorber.\nMarch 3 I WI 'll 1\\\n\n"
