JUNE 10th,1963 On Monday last, Joint Council elected Dave' Watson as President of the College and Dave Loftus as Secretary.\nFour candidates were up for the election.

A letter had been\nsent by the Tizard Hall Committee to the SCC and the RCC\nconcerning the use of their gallery levels. The RCC and SCC\nwere invited to hold meetings in\nSouth Side in the gallery levels of\nTizard Hall. In a letter addressed to Council, the Tizard\nCommittee apologised for writing\ndirect to the RCC-SCC instead of\nto Council, and claimed that their\nintentions had been misinterpreted. The Executive and Council, with the notable exceptions of\nthe Chairmen of the ACC and\nSCC were unanimous in their\nreply. Halls should concern\nthemselves with their own res i dents, and should work with the\nUnion to the best advantage of\nall the students of the College.\nTheir activities should at all\ntimes be complementary to those\nof the Union, rather than com-petit ive. Two other important points\ncropped up. The President and\nMr. Watson were both concerned\nabout the Debating Society.

After the\nannouncement of Union General\nAwards, Mr. Knight showed\nCouncil why he had been one of\nthe recipients. In an eloquent\n\u2022earnest speech, he put forward\nample reason for caution as regards Union finances. The union\nreceives some \u00a3700 p.a. from investments made by past Councils.\nAs a rule, ten per cent, of our\nannual income is invested, with\nthe result that finances are\nboosted by the interest. Estimates for the next session exceed\nincome, and these do not even include the usual ten per cent, to\nbe invested. Mr. Knight pointed\nout the folly of this : if investment decreases, so will income in\nthe long run, due to lower in\nte rest. He did not disagree with\nthe formation of new clubs, but\nCouncil must consider the wisdom of their present actions\nwh if ch could jeo pardi se future\nfinances.\nApart from Mr. Knight, the\nfollowing members of the College received Union General\nAwards ;\nAndrew Pawlowicz\u2014\nEditor of Felix\nJohn Maddison\u2014\nCarnival Organiser\nDave Dean\u2014Boat Club Captain\nJohn Shepherd\u2014Judo Club\nThese awards were made to\nthe above for their outstanding\ncontributions to the College in\ntheir respective fields.\nB. HOOPER.\nUnion meeting (cont.)\nAfter the warm up by the .\nACC, the best turn came, direct\nfrom the Ham. Soc, Laughing\nDon Pearson. After his customary \" Mr. President, Sir,\"\ncame the slow build up to various\nhackneyed gags. Politics are\nalways good for a laugh, so the\none about the Conservative Party\nmembership being up by 30 per\ncent, was a big hit. More was\nto come\u2014the Reds have decided\n: to liquidate the old Marxist\nForum and to form a Communist\nj Society. The joke wore a bit thin\n! with the rehash of NUS. Most\npeople had already heard it all\nto drop that one and look for\nanother gem in his depleted bag.\nI Then Don read out the aims and\nobjects of the newly-formed Flat\nEarth Society, starting with visits\nto the four corners of the Earth,\ntrips in flying saucers, finally reducing the already helpless audience to laughing chaos with the\npunch line, \" Safety precautions\nfor ships sailing off the edge of\nthe world.\" Laughing Don had\nscored a big hit, and this was acknowledged by \" com per e\" Chandmal.\nThe next turn was the Haclin\nproduction of a take-off of the\nKenneth Home show \" Beyond\nthe Understanding.\" \"The Square\nDancing Society is finding its\nfeet\" started the groaning, but\nwas soon topped by the one\nabout the Riding Club ha v ing more horses than mem-be rs. Not an outstanding\nscript, but it had its moments.\nObviously he had worked hard,\nand again the com per e reminded\nus of this.\nWhile all this was going on, the\nelections for Council Reps were\nalso being held ; the results were\nsuch that Dave Loftus could vote\ntwice for himself at Joint Council, while Norman Price will be\nable to play ball on next year's Council. Then on with the next\nact, presumably a gap-stopper\nbefore the big moment when the\ncom per e could get in the act him\nself. The Carnival produced a great deal of money and odd\nreferences to Bristol by John\nMadison. A good straight act,\nperformed quite smoothly. The\nbest job was the one behind the\nscenes\u2014Mrs. Rob had counted\nthe money.\nNow came the delicate, subtle\noriental Chandmal. Comedy\nlaced with serious rubbish\u2014and\nhe got away with it. The man is\nmystery. Where did he get that\none about the Phoenix rising\nfrom the Ashes ? \" Soho Print\ning \" was perhaps a little crude\nbut he made up for this with a monetary joke. \u00a314,000 are\nneeded to pay for the increased\ncosts of the new refectories.\nThis was accompanied by\nsuperb aphorism, splendidly ac\nclaimed : \" Drinkers should not\nsub sid is e eaters.\" The President\nthanked his front-man, PRO\nexpert J.B., and moved on with\nthe humour. \" Prominent\nfigures are always good for a laugh, and compare Chandmal\nproduced a superb character,\ncalled the Domestic Bursar. It\nappears that this man has a tendency to spend his time at a place\ncalled \" the Catering Sub-Committee,\" waiting for something to\nturn down, occasionally providing comic relief when caught out\nwallowing in the puddles of an\nafterthought.\nOne of the backstage men took\nthe stand now, to thank the com-per e for the good job that he\nhad managed through the year,\nno doubt with the aid of many\ntimely speeches. Heads nodded\nin agreement, and Mr. Liddle\nsat down. Mr. Chandmal\nhad not quite finished yet,\nthough\u2014he still had to announce\nthe names of those elected to the\nEntertainments Committee. This\none misfired, because he read out\nthe list of people with least votes\nto start with, but was soon corrected by one of the gentlemen\nwho had counted the votes. The\ncorrect names were read out to\napplause from the crowd. That\nwas great staging and a fitting\nclimax to the show. You must\nsee it again next year\u2014its a wow.\nB. LEVINN.\nED.'s Note\u2014to be taken in\nsmall quantities, preferably with\na pinch of salt.\nCommunist Society\nAt last the old Marxist Forum\nhas been scrapped and a Communist Society formed. The\nSociety has a long pedigree, from\nthe early days when after the\nproposed Society was turned\ndown in 1952, the Marxist subgroup was formed as an offshoot\nof the Lit. and Deb. Soc. After\nthe old RCCcumSCC was split\nUP and the SCC took on a liberal\" image, the sub-group\nwas allowed to become the independent Marxist Forum.\nThe latest change is in a nut-shell, out of the armchairs and\ninto the streets, from a purely\ntheoretical Society into a thor-ough-going political Society. This\nis necessary as it is recognised\nthat mere preaching will not\nchange society, but through political activity it is possible to\nchange the world from capitalism\nand war to peace and socialism.\nAt the same time political activity needs to be concentrated on\nshort term objectives, e.g., for a real change in student housing,\nfrom poor digs and few hostels to\nmore student controlled hostels\nand student flats, and for student\ncontrolled lodgings lists to ensure\ngood conditions and to have more\npower over landladies who refuse\nto take in coloured students.\nThe Society is interested in\nspreading Marxist ideas and in\nbringing to an end exploitation\nand the rat race. All those of\nyou who agree with these objectives are urged to join the Society\nand make your protest more\neffective, your ideals more tan-gi ble. "

    "content": "4 FELIX Sailim\nClul\nA YEAR OF FORTUNE AND MISFORTUNE FOR THE SAILING CLUB\nThe year began quite normally for the Sailing Club, with A and B points races, and instruction of novices proceeding well\nthroughout the Autumn Term. The first team, whose members comprise half of the U.L. first team, had several matches, home and\naway, during this term, and the second team met several other\ncollege teams, unfortunately without marked success.\nIt was also hoped at the beginning of the year to organise an\nI.C. ladies team, but this did not come about because of a lack of\nthe most essential items for this enterprise.\nThe term ended with I.C. boats\nlying 2nd and 4th in \" A\" points\nand 1st and 2nd in \" B\" points,\nand with about 175 hours of instruction completed.\nThe Christmas vacation\nbrought sub-Arctic temperatures,\nas all will undoubtedly re mem ber, and by the beginning of the\nSpring Term, ice on the Harp\nwas about five inches deep. Ice\nis apt to make Firefly sailing\nrather difficult, but no one was\nunduly worried, as this sort of\nthing has happened several times\nbefore at the beginning of\nJanuary.\nWe were not to know, how-ever, that the coldest weather\nthis century was about to descend\nupon our unsuspecting little\nisland from the unfriendly wastes\nof Siberia. This is what trans-pi red, nevertheless, and the ice\nremained on the Harp for two\nmore months, attaining a thickness of nine or ten inches at the\nheight of the cold season. Skaters\nand ice-yacht ers had much exercise during that period, but for\nus the Spring Term was virtually\na write-off. This was very unfortunate, because for both racing\nand instruction, the Spring Term\nis usually our most active period.\nHowever, about ten days before\nthe end of term, when we were\nall contemplating taking up skiing or snow-waste walking or\"\nsome other Arctic sport, the snow\nand ice finally vanished from the\nHarp. The greatest scenes of\nchaos since the sacking of Rome\nimmediately ensued, as chair-bound Sailing Club officers received word that the Castaway's Cup series of team races would\nbe held in about a week's time.\nThe Castaway's Cup is an annual competition organised by\nCastaways S.C.( which consists of\nex-members of U.L. S.C.), and\nthere is keen rivalry between the\nconstituent colleges of U.L. S.C. over the cup. Normally, most of\nthe Spring term is devoted to\ntraining and preparation for\nCastaway's, so it is a tribute to\nthe organisers that the event took\nplace at all. But all went well,\nand the competition was sailed\nover a week-end in strong winds.\nI.C., who already held the cup\nfrom last year (the first time we\nhave won it), retained it in fine\nstyle with a finals battle against\nChelsea.\nIt was decided, towards the end\nof the Spring Term, to award\n\" A\" and \" B\" points trophies\non the strength of the Autumn\nTerm's results alone. I.C. therefore came 1st and 2nd in \" B\" points, owing to the efforts of\nHugh Tothill and Andrew Thomson, and 2nd and 4th in \" A\" points through the efforts of Dave\nPertz and Eric Twiname.\nIt is interesting to note that\nthis is the first year for many\nyears that I.C. has not won \" A\" points. It was won this year by\nGraham Taylor, who used to win\nit for us when he was at I.C., but\nnow lectures at Battersea. Thus\nwe were in good spirits after\nCastaway's, until we lost one of\nour boats. Two days after Castaway's weekend F2168 was\nplaced on a trailer prior to removal from the Harp for main-ten ance. The following day an\nindividual with felonious tendencies removed her to another\ntrailer and departed, and neither\nhe nor the boat have been seen\nsince. This was a great blow, as\nF2168 was one of our better\nboats, and with her went two\nsuits of sails and other sundry\ngear. However, the vessel is in-sure d, so we will have a new boat\nif she is not found.\nDuring the Easter vacation\nseveral cruises were organised.\nThree boats went for a week on\nthe Norfolk Broads, and two East\nCoast cruises took place from\nMaldon. One of these, occupying a fortnight, extended to Holland, the other, for one week\nonly, got no further than Margate, owing to rather boisterous\nseas and gale force winds,\nalthough an enjoyable time was\nstill had by all the crew.\nThe Summer Term, in which\nwe now find ourselves, is never a very active one for the Sailing\nClub, as many people are struck\nby an entirely unreasonable urge\n(usually produced by not so unreasonable fears) to concentrate\non academic work to the detriment of their sailing. In spite of\nthis attitude, however, we managed to hold our Annual Championships on Wednesday, May\n15th, where some quite keen\ncompetition was encountered.\nThe Novices Trophy was won by\nRobin Gray, who entered the\nclub as a fresher at the beginning\nof the year, the Single-Handed\nTrophy by Dave Pentz, the Commodore (who is an old hand at\none-man sailing as he owns his\nown Finn), and the DoubleHanded trophy by Eric Twiname,\nnext year's Commodore.\nThe year's events have almost\nfinished now, and in all we have\nhad quite a successful time. We\nnow need to ensure that next year\nwill not be a mediocre one. We\nhope to have six boats in full\norder next year, and three of\nthem will be almost new (under\nsix months old) so there will be\nample opportunity for people to\nrace or to learn to sail. Anyone\ntoying with the idea of ceasing tc\nbe a landlubber will be very welcome in the club next year, when\nthe officers will try to uphold, or\nimprove on, the successes of this\nyear, while trying to eliminate the\nmisfortunes.\nPublished by FELIX BOARD.

The result came as\na surprise to many people, in\nview of the fact that Dave Wats\non was not known very well\ngenerally, unlike the three other\ncandidates. After the initial chit\nchat of the Council Meeting, the\nElection of Presiden* was reached\non the agenda, and in a tense at-mo sphere, votes were collected\nand counted.

Apparently the voting was fairly close,\nbut in the end it was Watson who\nwas declared elected, congratulated and invited to sit in on the\nrest of the Council Meeting:\n\" You're a member of Council as\nfrom just now.\"\nH.D.D. Watson was born in\nDecember 1939, was educated at\nBelfast Roval Academy.

    "content": "FELIX3 RCS REVIEW\nThe A.G.M. of the R.C.S. Union was held on May 23rd, in\nthe main Chemistry Lecture\nTheatre. The election of departmental reps., trophy officers, etc.,\nwas conducted efficiently by the\nPresident. As a test of strength,\nthe candidates for the two posts\nof trophy officer were required to\nlift the large bulk of the vicepresident into the air. These\ncandidates were also questioned\nabout their moral suitability for\nthe post. One ' gentleman,' who\nwas proposed and seconded by 5\nwomen, when asked what he\nwore in bed, replied that it depended upon whom he was sleeping with. He was elected. The\nother trophy officer elected was\napparently under the influence of\ndrink at the time. Enemies of\nR.C.S. should have an interesting\ntime trying to steal Theta next\nyear.\nThe only sporting success of\nthe year was. the winning of\nSports Day by^ the Mhletics\nTeam. This was fortunate for it\nprovided several cups and members of the Union used these filled\nwith beer to drink the health of\nthe Union. The Annual Reports\nwere presented. During the President's Report, four individuals,\none dressed as a priest and one\nas a hangman, descended from\nthe back of the lecture theatre\ncarrying some wooden beams.\nThese were quickly converted\ninto a set of gallows. The meet-ling waited expectantly. Mr.\nCHRIS TY E Harris concluded his report and\nhanded over the chair to the new\nPresident. Having done this he\nwas simultaneously arrested, tried\nand sentenced to death by hang-ing. The priest\" read the last\nrites ; Mr. Harris refused con-fess ion. Just as he was being\nstrung up, he was saved by a\" giggle of nymphs \" who transported him bodily (with head\nattached) to safety, much to the\nannoyance of the assembled mob.\nOfficers for the next year :\nPresident Chris Tye\nVice-President ... Simon Adlam\nSecretary Mike McMahon\nAssistant Secretary ... Andrea\nSutherland\nSILWOOD HOUSE BALL\nI An extremely warm evening\nand the pleasant grounds of Silwood Park combined well to give\na romantic setting to the Silwood\nBall. Initially the number of\ncouples strolling in the grounds\n(and halting a while behind the\nbushes) was greater than the\nnumber dancing inside to Les\nLeyton's band. The buffet\nsupper (prepared by V. Mooney\nland Co., S.W.7) was generally\nenjoyed, even allowing for the\nomission of coffee and the discrepancy between the printed\nj menu and the meal served.\nI The dancers and the strollers\n1 (about 80 couples in all) were\nlimited by the cabaret provided at\nIshort notice by Mick Emery\n\u2022(vocalist in Alan Elsdon's Jazz,\nBand) who sang beautifully to his\nj own guitar accompaniment. The\ndecoration of the main hall of\nline house in which the dancing\ntakes place is always difficult.\nJThis year it was attempted by the\n1use of clever lighting, but unfortunately the early failure of some\nj colour filters spoilt this.\n1 The front exterior of the house\nj was flood-lit, providing a hom-ling beacon for couples wandering\n\u2022in the countryside. One mis-Ichievous twit obtained great\namusement from directing a flood-light into the surrounding\ncountryside, thereby disturbing\nseveral couples.\nAfter a repeat cabaret performance the dancing continued\nuntil 5.30 a.m. Dawn came at\nabout 4 o 'clock reminding everyone that they had been up all\nnight and so feeling tired they\nbegan to drift home. To those\nwho knew nothing of the\ndrama behind the scenes it\nwas a great success; to those\nwho knew of the organisers' difficulties and watched the R.C.S. Entertainments Committee greying at the temples, it was a miracle. The main trouble, as\nMr. K. Sadhvani explained many\ntimes at great length during the\nevening, was the sudden cancellation of the arranged cabaret on\nthe day before. Fortunately,\nthanks to Ken Crobson, Mick\nEmery was contacted and he was\nan excellent substitute.\nThe R.C.S. Ents. Committee\nare to be congratulated on their\nachievement, which has crowned\na very successful year of enter-tai ning. They worked continuously from 10.0 a.m. Friday until\n8.0 a.m. Saturday. Many thanks\nLet us hope that their efforts reto them for a fine, enjoyable ball,\nsuit in a higher attendance at\nnext year's ball.\nSPANNERAMA\n23rd of May saw the. last\nGuilds Union Meeting of this ses-sion. Despite the close proximity\nof the exams, the meeting\nwas well supported. First\nitem on the agenda was\n\"elections,\" and Bob Schroter\nwas elected (unopposed) President, Rod Jones, Vice-President\nand Mike Cox, Secretary. As a result of a last minute no mina tion, Jim Carter defeated Robin\nClaridge, to receive the most\ncoveted award in Guilds, the\nNorris Muck Stirring Trophy.\nWith the serious business of\nthe day over, the President rose\namidst tumultuous cheers, and\ncries of \" strip, strip,\" to give his\nannual report. Various clubs in\nGuilds have had a most active\nand successful year, judging by\nthe appearance of various items\nof silverware at Union Meetings. The finances have been put\non a rational basis, and judging\nfrom the preliminary figures is-sued, net results have been most\nbeneficial. Summing up, the\nPresident said that no more than\nan average ly successful year\ncould be claimed, this being\npartly due to the un suitability of\nRoom 542 in Mech.Eng. for\nUnion Meetings, and the shifting\nnature of the College brought\nabout by the appearance of new\nbuildings. The full effect of the\nnew buildings is still to be fully\nfelt, and will no doubt prove a great challenge to next year's President and Executive. Chris\nLiddle concluded by saying what\ngood blok es all Guildsmen are\n(which we know, anyway) and by\nwishing the next Exec, all the\nbest.\nNext item on the agenda was\nthe Field Cup, which, for the un-initiated, is a sort of glorified\ntreasure hunt, the clues leading to\nsome \"thing \" which must be re-covered, and brought back.\nSpurred on by the beer y prize,\nvarious departmental groups sped\noff in diverse directions.\nThe proceedings, however, degenerated into complete chaos,\ndue to laying of false clues by\nElectricals, a most ungentlemanly\nactivity. (Editors' note\u2014After all,\nwhat else can you expect from\nGuildsmen ?) The member of\none group even ended up swimming under the Serpentine Bridge\nin order to retrieve a thing (?)\nthat was floating about. On the\nway back to College and their\nshining goal, the possessors of\nthe thing were foully waylaid on the steps of Mech.Eng.,\nthe bloody melee stopping after\nsome 15 minutes when the participants were informed that the\n' thing' in their possession had\nnothing to do with the Field Cup.\nBOB SCHROTER\nThe beer was eventually won\nby Electricals who kindly shared\nit with the old lags of the other\ndepartments.\nIn conclusion, we would just\nlike to say that we wish all our\nfellow Guildsmen all the best for\nthe coming year.\nCan Bob do this ?\nDRAMATIC SOCIETY\nThe Drama Soc. Old Lags (the\nComus Club) are presenting\n\"The Importance of Being\nEarnest\" for the London International Students Club on August 14th,15 th and 16th, at 7.30\neach night in the Concert Hall.\nIt is hoped that members of the\nCollege who will be in London at\nthat time will come and see it.\n\n"
