    "content": "PEL! X PROFILE THE RETIRING EDITOR There will tea new Editor in the chair next\nOctober , and he will have the task of gathering up the scattered talents of the FELIX Board, and\nfilling in the gaps. At the moment it looks as though he will find things easier than any editor before him; end much of the credit for this must\nlie given to0. II. Starmer.\nGeoff Starmer was born in1929, and went to Ecliool in Northampton where lie developed a strong a version towards compulsory sport. This grew in top.man ln wh i oh reached its climax one day a tH arlington, when he wielded a starting gun with such effect that seven runners had to retire with shot off to ec.( This technique has since been\nneed with great success byE. Waugh). As he\nlodged far from college Geoff also joined the Qroer Country Club, in order to improve the efficiency of his early bus catching. Oeoff first became known to the FELIX public by a number of elaborate drawings in which men\nand machines were inextricably mixed in indescribably in gene o us attitudes. Extremely proletarian in nature, this unu Bu al art form probably springs from Geoff' s four and a half years at Armstrong\nWhltworth's, when he rose at5.30 each morning to catch a train to Coventry. His close contact with work and industry has had en effect on his style of writing which is workmanlike n nd devoid of ornament, on his organisation of FELIX which is wor'-man like and to the point, and on his taste in drink which is workmanlike.\nHis later work in the Efficiency Department of TIMKENS resulted in his giving a paper to the C&G Eng. Soc., on \"Motion and Time Study;' a subject which he has not applied with conspicuous\nsuccess to his peregrinations round Hyde Park.\n( Incidentally, he is309 th best runner in England;\nor so the1953 National C.C., Championships would\nhave us believe). All biographers find a kele to nain the cupboard,\nand our's is too well known to be concealed. Geoff Stermer is an enthusiastic supporter of the I.O. j Railway Soo. ,and i a even helping in res each for a book on the ironstone railway of the Midlands. Enough of this painful subject. In vindication of his ohara o ter it should be recorded that he has\nbeen active in many other clubs; including Sailing( \"too in a otl ve\"), Rovers(\" too draught y\"), and\nPhotography (\"of railway engines, of course\"). In his first year he had outside interests.( When she\nleft he went carefully for a while, but is now\nwell known for his many outside interests). As a force on the FELIX Board he has been very successful. Founded on a system of regular and\npunctual Board meetings; his organisation has\nbecome so democratic that even this Profile was\napproved by p. majority vote after the Editor had\nrefused permission for it. His well disciplined meetings with red herrings ruthlessly suppressed,\nhave resulted in record crowds at Sunday make-up\nmeetings, Geoff has been imaginative and resourceful, as\nwitnessed by the Rag Supplement produced in February at two days notice; a fine comprehensive\npiece of reporting turned out in the face of many production and editorial difficulties. Above\nall his other qualities, he has been enthusiastic( even to the extent of Indiscreet, applause at rather wild student activities); an enthusiastic undergraduate with a zest for social matters; an enthusiastic Editor, ready to grumble or praise with great spirit, never with lack of interest; and his cheerful face, peering behind his enormous\nspectacles, will be greatly missed when we meet\nagain next term.\nPERSONAL ADVERTISEMENTS\nRoom for three or four passengers and lug, gage in a car going to Penzance at the end of term.\nContactS evi er,R.S.

The items of most interest for those of us returning next year were, of course, the elections. There was even more of These were even more of a formality than in previous years, there being no voting necessary for I.C. Council, and only six candidates for the Entertainments Committee of five..S. M..C.S. Results for I.C. Council( uncontested): W.S. Robinson, H. Huck in..... A. V.S. de Re uck, J. Anderson.\nC.& G.:B.

The President dealt con a is ely with tha\nyear's doings and made a very important point inclosing his Report; that next year, with reconstruction in progress, would be a very important and critical one, but he felt that the Union was in very good spirit and things would\nwork out smoothly.\nThe Chairman of the A.C.C., in collaboration with the Chairman of the S. C.C., emphasised his drive for brighter academic areas (ex-pounded by him in last issue of FELIX) by\nceremoniously donning a crimson silk dressing gown; Mark Abbott donned a blue one, not, as he said, as a necessary indication of his and\n' di j' Power's political persuasions. The irrespective reports were exo ellen t,Di j's being hilarious, Mark's laced with more intellectual witticisms. An important point made in matters arising from the previous meeting was that Council is making an exhaustive enquiry into voting pre ee dure, and would make recommendations to the Union next Session.

However, the mere fact that they were\nonly2 lengths behind U.C.&H.2 nd7111 gives an indication of the corresponding standard of I.C. compared with the other London Colleges. Meanwhile the I.C.2 nd Vl ll were rowing in the Thames Ditton Regatta. After rowing extreme-ly well in their first two heats to heat C his w l ck diS. and Berway, they were very unlucky in the Final to lose a dead-heat by 2 feet against the home or ew.A Maiden four rowing at Thames Ditton met\nan R.A.F. crew in their first heat and gave them\nthe fastest race of 'he day.\nThe following Saturday, the first IT( e ox swain less) went for the Wyfold Cup a+ Richmond\nRegatta, but unfortunately they were intercepted by an island, and lost mu oh val u abl at time in freeing themselves from birds' nests ano. ot ner scenery.

However it was a very tired crew that met Lensbury in the final, due\nto the firs' ry having had two extra races that day. After a very good row they lost to Lensb ury by2 lengths in the fastest time of the, day, the I.C. crew's time being the seo on dx as test. In the Wal'on fo wr s,I.C. beat Kingston and\nMidland Bank oom for taw ly in the first two heats but again in the Final the previous five rao es( with the Till) made I heir mark, and the victory went to Thames Rowing Club. The day's racing on the whole was very encouraging, much useful experience being gained. A word of praise must go to the IT, who had\nraced a total of six miles and had rowed no\nless than f if ten miles with the paddling up\nto the start.

    "content": "FELIX5 LUNCHTIME CONCERT\nThe I.C. Choir wound up a nexo ellen t year of Bu o ioa alcl ng by presenting alun oh time Cono ert in the Gym on Thuraday May 2 7 th. The numbers of both audie no e, and performers, were in ore a aed over previous summers; and if thi eo ono ert was any ix. dio ation the state of the Choir iso ert a in ly very healthy. This is due in no small measure to the efforts of the Conductor, Dr. K.H. Browi, who, having to follow Dr. Jacques, tuna not let the standard slip in any way, and haso ert a in ly made the Choir a very happy group. The programme consisted entirely of English mu Bio and opened with \"Ode for St. Cecilia' s Day\" by Pu roe ll. This is a well known work, and a fine our tain raise r. Dr. Brown's control was firm throughout and the Choir responded well in the brisker passages. The various sections of the Choir were not so happy in their quieter solo passages, and a few fluffed leads were noticeable. The second item was \" This is the Record of John\", verses from the first chapter of St. John's Gospel set to music by Orlando Gibbons. The\nsetting is for tenor solo and chorus, and is comp let ely delightful. Both soloist and choir obviously enjoyed themselves to th a full, and since the complexities of the work are not great, this performance was the best, item on the programme.\nThe final item was \"Serenade to Music\" by Taughan Williams, composed for the Jubilee, of Sir Henry Wood. In its original form the work was\nperformed by Sixteen of the country' s best, soloists. On this occasion, four soloists and th s choir were\nsufficient,. The music lis typical Taughan Williams, peaceful and lyrical, with tender flowing melodies and interlinking harmonies. The Choir did very well in this quieter work, and the soloist s,alt hough at rifle unsteady at times, were responsible for the overall effect by their sensitive singing. As is usual with these oca marts the soloists were\n, young musicians, aided this time by ana home-grown\nI.C. product, and th a freshness of their singing was a real delight. Finally a tribute must be paid to Christopher Shaw and Elizabeth Parker playing the two\npianos. For the music performed\u00bb they were the idea lac comp a nie ment, and to them, together with Dr. Brown* must be accorded the thanks of the Choir and the audie no e.J. S. S. ART EXHIBITION IN 'QUEENIES'\nThirty water o ol ours by Sir Alfred were exhibited last week in Ayrton Hall.

HOP\nTo t ne casual observer,% \u201e\u2022: aver't. \u00ab I.J. hop\nbears a marked resemblance to market lay in Bangkok, just after the slave trader i. ar pulled in. Atypical evening falls into tAo phases -the selection of a suitable young lady from the available resources sitting around the-gym, and later, the carrying off of one's prize to the dark room.\nShould we wish to have a preview of t ne joys in store, before committing ourselves to the extent of1/, this may be had by sitting in the lounge for the first half hour of the dance. Those\nexperienced gamblers amongst us, who are wise enough to hide behind a hedge on Newmarket Heath\nsoon after dawn for several mornings, before maki ng any rash racing decisions, will realise that this is time well spent. Having transferred ourselves to the gym we are at once confronted by a I solid phalanx of gentlemen,' at this point in the1 evening some ten days around the door. A little resolute effort will, however, bring us to the comparative void beyond, where a few couples may\nbe dancing, while the. rest of the ladies will be\nsitting around the walls. These latter do not, as a rule, seem over im Dressed with the joy's of life,. particularly those connected with I.e. hops, and are possibly reflecting that they were stark raving mad too ome in the first place. This may\nbe because nobody has asked them to dance, or the one particular gentleman with whom they wished to dance is otherwise engaged; or perhaps there is not one single gentleman round the door with whom they would have the slightest inclination tb. nee even if given the oh ance.( The author re... ses the unlikelihood of this possibility but mentions it for the,/ sake of completeness.) An interval comes'about 9.30 and it is as well to make this the deadline for obtaining a partner. We must remember that it is so easy to relinquish one passable young lady, in the hope that something better will turn up. It doesn't and by the time we have come to this regrettable conclusion, the above young lady i a sitting in the oo rner with somebody we had previously thought our friend, looking as if she had known him a lifetime. Comes the interval and it is generally considered well worth the outlay of six penny worth of orange juice at this stage, to have someone upon whom to lavish wit and sparkling conversation. Soon, if unattached we will have \"to chose'between a continuation of the hunt among at those ladies who had to buy their own orange juice, and the bar where we may moral is e with other e in a similar position, on the barbarity of it all, and our unwillingness to be a party tosu oh things. Assuming we have been fortunate, however, the next stage is the transfer to the dark room.\nHaving observed to one's partner( this approach is more suited to a new o omer to I.e.), that the gym\nis far too crowded to dance in properly, or that it is hot, one might suggest no noha lant ly that there is plenty of room in the Upper Dining Hall, where the sweet so en ted air brings a new breath of life to anyone (\n,\na ruffled young lady, who may\nhave been unfortunate enough to speak with aF reno h accent, scampering from the above room at this point, can wreck a whole evening's work -adieu paniers, vend an ges sent fait es!). Now,\nfirst impressions of the dark room are against it. Eyes u naco us to med to the dark do not appreciate a to no e that there is plenty of light oo ming through the windows from the lamp post\noutside. Add to this the seeming reluctance of many people to take advantage of the vast tract of dancing spa oe, and there may be some; initial doubt in a lady' s mind that the dark .\n- i;n is quite nio e. Fortunately, it is as: \u2022 le matter to explain that the dark room is quite respectable, really, which aS suran oe should satis i yan v other ideas she might possibly entertain.

    "content": "LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. Ei ITOR'S ROTE: In our last Issue, we published a letter from Ur. J. M. Hathaway, In wh i oh he\nor lt lola ed our re ort of the visit of six mem-ber:' of I.C. Union to Western Germnny. The re port was certainly not l nao our ate, but we accept the t It was biased. Limitations of apace\nin FELIX prevented us f nom printing the whole\nof their activities, and it was felt that an\na ooo un taf the more serious as pe ots of th tir visit oo ule be given in PHOENIX, and that FELIX should o one ant rats oh the lighter side of\nthe tour. This arrangement is particularly des ir able when it is realised that the opinions of eon ditions and eo on or aio recovery in Western Germany are likely to be very controversial and considerable space is neo ess ary to give an\nunderstanding of both sides of the question. The Editor, Felix. Jan Lui ken stra at,10, Eindhoven, Netherlands.* wear sir,I was in London recently and picked up a copy of FELIX whilst I waa in the Union. I regret to Bay that I was disappointed with it.3 e low an indio ip her able headline I counted a number of spelling mistakes, many more typing errors and numerous splodge s and marks that really ahould n't be there at all. My impression was that the standard of production has declined appreciably from the standards set some years ago. I know only too well the difficulties of\nproducing Felix at all every fortnight but I do\nthink you must Insist on a slightly better standard from your assistants. As to the cont ent of the issue( I bought it on the 1 4 th of May - I'm not sure of the date of issue) I will say nothing except to ask if you really think i to on tai ned the most important and representative news of the College? please do not let FULIX become too flippant. Remember its prime\nfu notion is a newspaper.\nYours sincerely, Cliff. Hargreaves Dear Sir, Have you any hope of a bear, a girl, and night out?\nDo you hope to pass all your exams., get a good job, high\npay, house, family, and oar? Have you any hope for the\nthings you really want?\nBut are these the things we really want? Do we not\nseek happiness and a worthwhile life; the others are\nsecondary. What then doe3 make su on a life? Not money\nnor pleasures. Psychology has no simple answer and nor\nhas Christianity but i to an and does often make great\nchanges in peoples lives and hopes.\nIn America this summer many Christians will be discussing \"The hope of the world\" at the great Yforld Counoil\nof Churches' Assembly. Early next term many of these men\nand women will be in England speaking to students up and\ndow rr the country. KXAtf THAN (cho tarn) who will speak\nat this College on Oot. 12 and 15 worked at Rangoon University and is much concerned with racial and international\nproblems.

The\nfollowing motion was then put :- \" That the A.G.M. of\nJuilds be held in Hyde Park\". The more serious elea ent of\nthose present at the meeting foresaw the possibility of\nthe general public voting in the elections and the motion\nwas f&m mended. \u201e \"Kxcept for the elections, the A.G.M. of\nGuilds be held in Hyde Park\".

'he President is to be on rr a tula t\"d on a fine account of the years Im^p^ nin^s. Dear Sir, In your last issue you published a letter advocating that ao a dem lo gowns should\" be\nwo in at I.C. One of the reasons adv an oed in favour of this suggestion was that gowns are \"the\ncenturies old trade-mark of soho lars and students\". Surely this is the very reason why\ngowns should NOT be worn. What is the use ef\"\nintroducing a false impression of soho lar ll nea a amongst those attending a technological cramming shop?\nIt is widely believed by students that large sums of money are to be spent, and are being spent already, on enlarging the fao ill tle a for training soo all ed\" technologists\"( witness the activity on the roofs of the R.3.M. and\nGuilds; and around Chem. Tech; and the new Admin, building in Queens Gate) but how mu oh i a to be spent in rectifying the deplorable lack of residential ac como dati on for students?\nWe are told that two or three year a spent at college gives one a broader view of\nlife. A broader view of lab. reports, and tea*\ntubes, and suburban trains perhaps, but there should be more to life than this. It seen a to me that, the present poll oy of I.C. is to train< suitable youth technically while ignoring th a fundamental needs, for mere existance, of a place to eat and sleep; let alone the requirements, for life, of opportunities to exchange\nrl ews with others. I believe that there is more to life than squinting down some super-microscope or\nsitting at the control panel afa high-speed\nturbine. Moreover, I believe that a\"lo to an be learnt about life by discussion with others. Men who will be of most use to the community\ntomorrow are those who know how to live, net those who know only how to twiddle the centre! knob of some mao h in e. It is said of a en whe ga\nto the Uni vera it y that\" it doesn't matter what\nyou read at college, so long as you ga tae el*le ge\". What a pity that cannot be said of\nI.C. Expansion is certainly going ahead an\nthe teo hnl o al side of the college, but no pre-gres s appears to be made towards making I.C. residential. I am for oed to the conclusion that the aim is to turn out automatons for the industrial mao hi ne,to pra duce slaves who will operate the factories and the mines of this country without ever being troublesome about\nthe reason why.\nIn the oi rou mst a noes, sir,I submit\nthat gowns would be a mockery here. Yours sino ere iy,. T.K. Almond,\nR.C.S. UNION MEETING At the A.G.M. of the R.C.S. Union held on Friday,\nMay 21 at a vote of chinks waa passed to the Ministry of\nWorks for the work they had put in hand for the convenience of the students and also for at last piping in a supply of drinking water - at present confined to the\nPhysics dept.

However, the Police and t ne Dean decided that with November 5 th and the spanner episode sI.C. has had its ration of destructive and obstructive rags for this year. Tony Gill was warned that all the' Regul at ions concerning behaviour in Hyde Park would\nbe rigidly enforced on Friday afternoon. The\nmood of the Union General Meeting was to dispense with the advice of the Aut nori ties, and dark\nquestions were asked: \"What is the centre of buoyancy of a Police man? \"\nHowever, discretion triumphed, and the\nsecond half of the Annual General Meeting was\nheld peaceably under the Chestnut trees in Hyde\nPark.\n'Bo' was t ne focal point of the meeting, being present in the capacity of \"a platform on wheels\"( no cars allowed on the grass, PLEASi)).\nDoubts had been expressed about the general public voting in the Guilds elections, but the\nfew enquire rs showed no further interest when\nthey were told' it was not_ a strike. A solitary mounted policeman showed some\ninterest in the meeting, but his horse indicated disapproval by presenting his back continually. The Race itself took Its original form of\nboat race for u ox 'ed pairs up the Serpentine to the3 ridge, between t ne various departments of\nGuilds. A rule of the Race was that none of the Crews\nshould be members of the Boat Club, but un fortune ly one of the Departments neglected this( they shall be nameless;, but atleast they didn' twin. Tne el eot rica ls went into the lead from the\nstart but due to the enthusiasm of 2 non-competitors, were rammed. Prom this point, the\naeros. were in front until they were intercepted by several swimmers from the lido side of the\nSerpentine.... The civil s then forged ahead and\nwere t ne first to reach the Bridge.. By this time tn era in was lashing across the water and\nit was rather difficult to see who came second,\nbut it is bet ie ved the mechanical s filled this place. The electrical s were third. Ariotner non competing boat intercepted the\none mic als and in the ensuing fight, the chemicals went under. Tne spectators had become 3oak ed by\nt ne deluge and some, realising that the Serpentine was not much wetter, dived into help or hinder t ne chemicals re float their boat, whilst this was\ngoing on, the aeros. crept up into4 th place. All the boats were returned so that no\nboats, crews, spectators or deposits were lost..

    "content": "FELIX3 THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nEditor t G.H. Starmsw. Circulation t1X50 The academic year is fast drawing to a close;\ntake first place in our mind and there is little tl\u00bbe for other activities. FELIX appreciates this state\nof affairs and, so that our readers are not detracted from\ntheir studies, this will be the last issue of the present\nsession. We wish all of our readers success in their\ncaning encounters with the examiners and hope that they\nwill be here again to support FELIX next year.\nFKLIX needs your support. It is independent of the\nUnion's finance, being about the only thing in I.C. that\nis not a drag on the union funds.' The fact that it has\nto pay its way is a spur to the efforts of the board to\nmake it as interesting to its readers as possible - if wo don't always succeed it is not forwent of the attempt.\nIf there was any thought of a subsidy these efforts would\nbe lessened and that is why FELIX wishes to be independent.\nWhy all this talk of finance and independence? This\ntons has seen the introduction of SENNET - tho university\nnewspaper. Its standard of production is far superior\nto that of FELIX and since SENNET is also sola for 3d, wo agree that it gives you better value for your money.\nThis is partly due to a subsidy, which is neo ess ary if it is to be a good representative of L.U., and also\nbecause of a such bigger circulation. But because of this\nbeg ger circulation it cannot report activities at I.C. so\nwell as a college newspaper. In its last issue it stated\nthat Mr. D. Kale, its next editor, was at Guilds, but\nFELIX is able to report, more accurately, that Dinesh is a member of the Eoyal School of Mines - and proud of it.'\nSince. FELIX is a college paper it should serve I.C. well but, for the same reason, it can never give satisfactory coverage to University news which is the purpose\nof SENNET. Thus we feel that FELIX and SENNIT are com-ple ment ary, and that -there is no need for competition between us. Unlike the newspapers of other London colleges,\nFELIX made no disguised attacks on the university paper,\nbut even co-operated in using its own sales organisation\nto sell SENNET. And next term, a member of the FELIX\nboard will be editor of SENNET.\nBut it is no use FELIX regarding SENNET as complementary, if members of .this college buy SENHET in preference to FELIX. We have already said that we consider\nSennet as far as the amount of reading in it, is a better\nthreepenny worth. Nevertheless, for members of 1,0.,\nnews of activities in the college are of more immediate\ninterest and it would be a pity if FELIX had~to apply for\nfinancial assistance from the Union because of a reduced\ncirculation.\nDuring the time that SENNET has been on sale, the\nsales of FELIX have been about one hundred above those for\nthe equivalent issues of last year. This may seem to\nindicate that there is no fear of FELIX's circulation\ndeclining but it must be remembered that our readers have\nthe FELIX-buying habit which they have a qui red during the\ntwo terms previous to the appearance of SENNET. Next\nyear's fresher s will not have this habit but will be faced\nby two publications. We ask our present readers to educate the fresher s regarding SENNET as the complement of\nFELIX so that I.C. will continue to have a lively journal for the dissemination of news of particular interest\nto itself. That FELIX is a college newspaper is emphasized by\nthe member of people who help it in some way or other.\nOur thanks go to the President and Sec. of I.C. Union,\nwho have nearly always been willing to 3up ply us with news\nand at the same time respect our independence - even if if does moan that the facts are not always represented to\ntheir li kin.' We would also thank those secretaries of\nclubs and societies who have continuously fed us with news\nof their activities and especially for the facilities to\nFELIX reporters given by the Social Clubs Comsdttee,\nDramatic Socy., Cross Country Club, Eng. Soc, Padio Soc.\nand Motor Club. We hope that all of these have been duly\nrewarded through the reports in FELIX and if some clubs etc.\nfeel that FELIX neglects them, we would like to say that\nif we are informed of their activities, it is almost\ncertain that one of our staff rd.ll be along.\nMention should be made of the debt we owe to the\nGuilds registry who were a great help in co-operating in the production of the rag supplement in the Spring Term.\nAlso helping in the production of FELIX are the y c ing ladies from the London College of Secretaries who do some\nof our typing (the part without the mistakes) in each\nmake-up Sunday. Then there are the salesmen without whom\nthe circulation of FELIX would be nowhere. There are too\nmany of thorn to mention by name but their work is very\nmuch appreciated by FELIX - if not by the Guildsmen who\ncan't get by the gang of aggressive vendors mustered by\nJohn Hanson, without buying a copy. We are very grateful to John DaviBS who has contributed to the pro duo tion ft f FELIX by lending us his typewriter eae h make-up Sunday, sometimes at great in con veh ien. ee to himself. Lastly, as edi xor,1 would like to thank those members\nit tho board who, though getting no benefits such as sub-sidi sed travel etc. as with I.C. Clubs etc., give up\n\u2022tush of -Uieir time to FELIX. They receive little of the\nlimelight and so some space can be devoted to their act-iv i ties: Elizabeth Hamilton, the secretary, who keeps our\nrecords straight and attends to the complimentary copies\n- 18 are sent out to various London colleges alone;\nJohn Pownall, treasurer, who vainly tries to relate the\nmoney taken each week with the number of copies printed;\nA.B, Blake, advertising manager, who acts as an intermedia tar y between our treasurer, after the money and the\nadvertisers who don't want to part with it; Bill Hudson,\ncirculation manager, often to be seen late on Thursday\nevening trying to keep FELIX, and his beard, out of the\nwheels of his bicycle; Don Grasham, publicity manager,\nwho is responsible for the wonderful posters seen around\nthe college; John Seeley, the production Manager, who\nhas been the stalwart in the negotiations with the printer\nin trying to improve the appearance of FELIX; Mary\nMcKenzie assistant to the productions manager.\nBesides these there is the editorial staff - Mac\nFraser, News editor, who seems to think that most of\nt'.;e things happening at I.C. go on in the bar; Buster\nDeacon, Features editor, who gives a true Journalistic\nflavour to the board by never giving any indication of\nhis cooling s or goings; Paul Harding, Sports Editor,\nwho is renowned for never having attended a single board\nmeeting but no one can deny the success of the sports\npage; Geoff Grimshaw,' coming events editor, the instigator of the improved layout of the Coming Events col un wi; Roger Sykes, Art Editor, who with Peter Southgate (\nPASS) produces the amusing drawings which enliven our pages;\nJulius Kosky, Photographi.j Editor.\nMy thanks also go to our contributors - Ray Bonet\nour critic at Drarasoc productions; Ian Kerr, our. critic, but not forecaster, of the Choir concerts; Trevor mt then who has been of great help in trying to improve the photographs in FELIX, even though the printer has usually\nmanaged to foil his attempts; together with Bob Fillmore\nM. Per rl s and Paul Teun*Lastly, but by no means least, I am very grateful\nto Robin Bray, who has prevented me from making too many\nmistakes, and Dinesh Kale, Editor Emerities, who has\nalways been willing to do whatever was needed.\nNEWS FROM THE REFECTORY COMMITTEE\nREFECTORY PROGRESSES.\nThe Refectory is at last showing signs of recovery.\nLosses in the past two terms have slowly diminished, and\nthere is reason to hope that they will eventually vanish\ncompletely. The only meal which consistently runs at a loss is breakfast, and it seems in eve it able that it will continue to do so until more custom is found.\nThe progress is due mainly to the efforts of the new\nmanager li r lio one y,in close co-operation with the Catering sub-committee. Readers must have noticed that quite\napart from food, small things like more lights, more water jugs, racks for trays on the sides of the tables and\nso on have made the Refectory a far better place than of\nold. It is to be hoped that the improvement continues.\nWine - list. The Wine Committee had been set up by the i.i fec tory Committee to investigate and make recommendations on the\nwine situation in the college. It has pro du noda most\nstimulating report.\nIt recommends, among other things, that a wine-list\nbe printed and given suitable circulation. It also roo om mends the pu e chase of a snail loo m slr lng plant or refrigerator, to be selected with a view to Its later re-in ebf tall ation in ths new bar (which will replace Committee\nRooms A3 The committee are of tho opinion, that the\n\"cultivation of an educated taste in wines should be encouraged by pricing wine as cheaply as possible. * The) report also contains rex com end at ions regarding wines and\nspirits to be laid down for future e am sump tle B sad 0 1\ncession rates for functions.\n\n"
