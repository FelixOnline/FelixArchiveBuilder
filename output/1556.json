    "content": "10 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNintendo\u2019s Ethical Legacy\nC\nomputing power is\nevolving at a relentless\npace. The gaming industry\nmoves in tandem with\nthis tempo. Unfortunately\n(and for some, regrettably) its viability\nhas waned in recent years having come\nunder pressure from a burgeoning\nsmartphone market and a reversion\nto the PC as the preferred platform of\nchoice. Playstation serves as a suitable\nallegory, experiencing a 15% like-for-like drop in revenue of US $1.19 bn\nfor the April-June quarter. Likewise\nNintendo, despite a market valuation\nof US $85 bn, faces \ufb02agrant criticism\nfor failing to su\ufb03ciently \u2018move with\nthe times\u2019. Avid enthusiasts can expect\na turbulent future. I \ufb01nd it all slightly\ndepressing.\nIn spite of this all hope is far from\nlost for Nintendo as a perennial\nJapanese multinational. The recent\nrelease of P\u00f3kemon X & Y has served\nto brighten the horizon. A notable\n1.26 million units were pre-ordered in\nJapan, with a similar reception to the\nfranchise emulated around the globe.\nThe event served to spark memories\nof my childhood. I recall in\ufb01nitely\nmany afternoons spent in euphoric\nbliss levelling up my Pikachu, seeking\ncounsel with The Great Deku Tree in\nThe Legend of Zelda or tripping out\non Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 64.\nI \ufb01nd that the modern games\nconsole is recurrently misconstrued as\nan instrument of detriment. National\nsurveys in England estimate that\nthree in ten two-to-15-year-olds are\noverweight . It has been suggested that\nthe reversion of children to sedentary\npastimes (including television and\ngames) is the core reason for the\nphenomenon. I categorically believe\nthat the blame lies elsewhere.\nIn an attempt to vindicate the games\nconsole I want to analyse Nintendo\nproducts. For decades they have\ninvigorated innumerable dynamic\nand lofty thoughts in children,\npromoted logic and injected moral\nallegories into the plots of their\ngames. One might even stretch to say\nthat Nintendo introduced children\nto the philosophical concept of self-determination and utopian aspiration.\nTo begin with, let us consider\nthe Mario video game franchise.\nElements of its world and adventures\nare simultaneously dynamic and yet\n\ufb01xed. Children are introduced to\nthe con\ufb01nes of Euclidean geometry\nthrough the recurrent appearance\nof recognisable shapes (mushrooms,\nman-eating \ufb02owers and gold coins to\nname but a few). A child familiarises\nthemselves with this concept with\nrelative ease. Upon achieving this,\nthe child is now free to explore the\nopportunities presented by the\n\ufb01ctional \u2018world\u2019 with its given set of\nparameters. A reader might be able\nto relate to the awe instilled in the\ncatacombs of the mind when playing\nSuper Mario 64, Paper Mario or Super\nMario Galaxy. The crux of Nintendo\u2019s\nfranchise is its predictability. Despite\nthis, by interchanging the parameters\nto 2D graphics or by giving Mario the\nability to \ufb02y, a child is introduced to\nEoghan J. Totten\n@eoghantotten\nComment Editor\nthe concept of innovation and rebirth\nwithin a rational and predictable\nworld. It might be argued that this\ncan encourage resolve, enthusiasm\nand optimism in a child. It may even\nevolve to become a transferable and\nindispensable skill in later life.\nThe Legend of Zelda saga is\nsaturated with material from which\none can draw inference. Taking\ninspiration from a blend of (to my\nmind) Celtic, Scandinavian and\nOriental lore, children are introduced\nto the fundamental challenges and\nquestions relentlessly pondered by\ncivilisation for millennia. Enclosed\nwithin the framework of quests\nand interspersed with \u2018temples\u2019 and\n\u2018bosses\u2019 to thwart, children can \ufb01nd\nthemselves engulfed in mimesis.\nTheir eagerness and anticipation to\ndiscover further twists to the plot\nmorph with the unfolding tragedy\nrecounted by the game. It might be\ndebated that children are introduced\nto the concept of catharsis, a form of\ncleansing or emotional renewal. The\nwider relevance of this is to stimulate a\nchild\u2019s awareness of the essential place\nof culture, art and identity in society,\nunveiling a new dimension to human\nexistence. While the world may be\nfull of physical wonder there is also,\nhowever, a world buried deep within\nthe catacombs of our minds. In this\nrealm reasons for our identity and our\nactions, that universally preoccupy\neach and every one of us, dominate\nthe everyday machinations of the\nworld.\nFrom this we can identify the\npresence of ethics within the thread of\ngames produced by Nintendo. Bearing\nthis in mind we might choose to\naddress P\u00f3kemon. It is a world where\nsociety is centred on pre-meditated\nparochialism. Walking is the preferred\nmode of transport. Vehicles are only\nused when necessary. The economies\nappear to be planned and seem to\nbene\ufb01t all citizens. With a mart and\nhealth centre as the principal business\nestablishments, consumerism has no\nplace in the towns. The larger cities\nare sparsely populated and exhibit\nluminous, clandestine walkways.\nCharacters encountered during the\ncourse of the plot all exude a sense\nof well-being; the man in the street\nexpresses analogous content to that of\nthe most successful P\u00f3kemon masters.\nMan\u2019s relationship with nature\n(P\u00f3kemon) is inherent, and rooted as\na central tenet of society. Academic\nresearch appears to wholly revolve\naround P\u00f3kemon. One could list many\nmore desirable facets however reality\ntells us that such a utopian existence\nis unattainable. The restlessness of the\nhuman id fails to surface.\nThe trainers don\u2019t get mugged in\nthe dark. The P\u00f3kemon battle on a\nregular basis and yet blood is never\ndrawn. Emotions of anger, lust and\njealousy are rarely, if ever, presented\nin the plot. For me this is of signi\ufb01cant\nimportance; children may notice that\nthe incongruities of the real world\nare excluded from the adventure.\nThey may well extend this inference\nto a collection of other Nintendo\ngames. They are presented with the\nopportunity to compare and contrast\nand ultimately, build an informed\nopinion.\nDespite the mediation of the\nP\u00f3kemon world, each successive\ngenerationhasre\ufb02ectedcontemporary\ntechnology. Professor Oak\u2019s chunky\ncomputer has gradually been replaced\nwith a sleek model over time (and\nyet teleportation has always been\npossible\u0001). One might draw from this\nthat the game, despite its enclosed\nambiance of insulation, further\nencourages a player to compare and\ncontrast. P\u00f3kemon is more relevant\nthan ever. In our world of vigorous\nexpansionism, the game brings\nattention to a need to live within\nour means. Sustainable trimming,\nrather than development, may\nindeed be the way forward. Man\u2019s\nenmeshed relationship with animals,\nas illustrated in P\u00f3kemon, promotes\nconnotations of the current\nEuropean policy of \u2018Rewilding\u2019.\nTo close, Nintendo provides\nmore than a desirable legacy but a\nfully-\ufb02edged set of blueprints for\na bene\ufb01cial gaming industry. In a\nworld where many fail to raise their\neyes from their phone or tablet to\nlook at the stars in the night sky, a\nrevitalised approach to technology\nwould be desirable. In the past it has\ntaught children to look treat their\ntechnology as a mere catalyst for the\nawnings of the mind. I simply hope\nthat it has a place in future markets\nto do the same in the future.\notten\nNINTENDO NINTENDO\n\n"

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 18 OCT\nCOMMENT\nRalph Miliband: A Benefactor of Slander\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nT\nhe recent Daily Mail \u2018essay\u2019\n(to use Daily Mail sketch\nwriter Quentin Letts\u2019\nwonderful euphemism) on\nProfessor Ralph Miliband\nhas demonstrated once more, in no\nuncertain terms, the vicious and\nquite frankly lunatic nature of some\nelements of the British Press. They\nhave, quite rightly, come under the\nstrictest censure and condemnation\nfor what can only be described as\na hateful and fear-\ufb01lled piece. On\nthe other hand (this is not to defend\n\u2018The Mail\u2019 in any way) I could hardly\ndescribe the article as a \u2018smear\u2019.\nThat the article was written to vilify\nis in no doubt. The actual result has\nbeen, on the other hand, positive.\nAfter all the Mail has introduced\nus all (be honest, how many of you\nknew of Marxist academic Ralph\nMiliband last month?) to an erudite\nand redoubtable intellect. Some of the\nMail\u2019s statements sound like praise,\nat least to my ears, be it \u201cMiliband\nwas taught politics by Harold Laski,\na giant of Labour\u2019s Left\u201d or \u201cHe was\nalready on his way to becoming a\nheavyweight thinker\u201d, and I positively\nenvy both the position of his grave\n(just twelve yards from that of Karl\nMarx!) and the subdued eloquence of\nhis epitaph \u2018Writer Teacher Socialist\u2019.\nThe Mail\u2019s argument does not make\nsense; \ufb01rst they attack Professor\nMiliband as a dangerous socialist\nespousing a \u2018poisonous ideology\u2019,\nthen they criticise some dubious\ntax a\ufb00airs (an issue that is genuinely\nconcerning) as \u201chardly the behaviour\nof a tax-loving socialist.\u201d This reminds\nme a little of Freud\u2019s old broken kettle\njoke: I \ufb01nd that a kettle I had lent to\na neighbour is now broken. They\nexplain that: 1) they had returned the\nkettle undamaged; 2) the kettle was\nbroken when they received it; and 3)\nthey never borrowed the kettle o\ufb00 me\nanyway. The Mail\u2019s argument lacks the\nsophistication for three excuses: You\nget the point.\nMore important than internal\ninconsistencies in the Mail, however,\n(or indeed the negative attitude\nbehind the article itself, which is, let\nus be honest, simply business as usual\nfor a rag) is the manner in which the\nMail has been criticised. The \ufb01rst is\nthe remarkable inanity of the very\ncriticism that \u201cit\u2019s unfair to attack\na dead man\u201d. This may be so, but I\nwould suggest dead people do need\nvilifying, not least Lord Northcli\ufb00e,\nfounder of the Daily Mail. \u201cSeventeen\nyear olds write stupid things\u201d. Yes,\nthey do, but the excerpt quoted by\nthe Mail seems reasonable \u2013 we must\nnot forget that Britain still has the\nmost disgraceful colonial record in\nhistory, despite the attempts of the\nJapanese, the Belgians, the Americans\netc. Finally, who really cares whether\nsomeone hates \u2018their\u2019 country or not?\nThe second would be the remarkable\nconsensus across political parties\nabout the incorrectness of the Mail.\nThere is evidence that The\nConservative Party (despite Vince\nCable\u2019s warnings) are still human,\nperhaps a sign, even, that the entire\npolitical class is able to transcend the\npetty rivalries of partisan politics and\nachieve a \u2018third way\u2019 perspective on\nboth matters of \u2018national importance\u2019\nand basic human \u2018decency\u2019. It is when\nwe arrive at this conclusion that alarm\nbells ring.\nThe \ufb01rst point of concern was made\nin an otherwise deeply stupid article\nby Tim Stanley in the Telegraph\n(an article that, relying only on ad\nhominem and tu quoque, compared\nthe journalistic integrity of the Mail\nand the Guardian), noting that the\nMail has given ample reason for the\nGovernment to push forward moves\nfor press regulation. The point was\nbrought home to me by Tory MP\nGrant Shapps, whose approach on\nquestion time left me musing that \u2018\u2018the\nMP doth protest too much, methinks.\u2019\u2019\nThe second point was already being\nmade by none other than Ralph\nMiliband in his 1977 book, Marxism\nand Politics: \u201cIn the liberal view of\npolitics, con\ufb02ict exists in terms of\nConfessions of a GTA: Part Two\nS\nadly, this is true. In fact it\nis an acronym for \u2018graduate\nteaching assistant\u2019. You\nknow, the ones standing\nat the front chatting to\nthe professors instead of helping you\nout. Yep, I\u2019m one of those and as far\nas I\u2019m aware we do not steal cars,\nonly solutions to questions when\nthe lecturers truly overestimate\nour abilities. We do not get chased\ndown by cops but by students in the\nlast minute of a two hour tutorial,\ndeciding that they don\u2019t understand\nthe entire subject so far. And we don\u2019t\ngo to glamorous parties. Well okay,\nmaybe we do...\nOn the other hand, this week we\nfound out in our training that we do\nsomething pretty cool. GTA training is\ncompulsory for all students wanting to\nhelp out. If you don\u2019t go, you don\u2019t get\npaid, which of course means we all go\nbut our interest is obviously driven by\nwanting to assist the future Imperial\ngraduates. We are just those kind of\npeople. It is three hours; what could\nthey have to say that could possibly\ntake that long?\nWell, there is a lot of jargon, like\nlearning styles: after a questionnaire,\nI turned out to be a re\ufb02ective, visual,\nsequential, sensor learner. These are\nwords meaning that I like to learn with\npictures, not words, in an organised\nmanner by learning step by step, not\nas part of a group. How I got through\nImperial I have no idea! Apparently\nthey cater for the completely opposite\nperson. This strange species are\nactive and intuitive. They like dealing\nwith lots of theory in text and enjoy\nworking with other people. The test\nbasically said that I was, in e\ufb00ect a\ngenius, as I managed to do a course\ntaught entirely wrong for me. This\nclearly did not surprise me.\nWhat did surprise me is the\nuniversity\u2019s opinion of us. They see us\nthe front line of student interaction.\nWe are the shield that stops students\ntotally embarrassing themselves by\nasking a stupid question of a slightly\ncrotchety lecture, who has had all\ntheir solutions stolen by some post-grad. We stand doggedly in the cold\nand wet preventing students walking\ninto large machinery on \ufb01eld trips. We\nguide them through the \ufb01rst few days\nof hellish programming where nothing\nmake sense and 1+1 no longer seems\nto work according to the computer.\nWe are on the front line of feedback\nto tell students what isn\u2019t and what is\nde\ufb01nitely a stupid question.\nThus, we may not be manic gamers\nconvinced that what Felix really needs\nis a low down on what we do in a\nvirtual reality each week, but we do\nhave our uses. So next time you see\nus chatting away at the front, ask us a\nquestion, because if there is one thing\nGTAs are good at is answers; we stole\nthe solutions. The GTA\n\u201cGTA does not stand for Grand Theft Auto!\u201d\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\n\u2018problems\u2019 to be \u2018solved\u2019. The hidden\nassumption is that con\ufb02ict does not,\nor need not, run very deep.\u2019\u2019 This\nis always the assertion on a ruling,\ncomplacent class and it is with only a\nlittle exaggeration that I claim every\nground-breaking political advance\nin history has been based on the\nnotion of antagonism and committed\nstruggle.\nThis is why I see the recent\n\u2018polarization\u2019 of politics as a good\nthing; for all his faults (and they are\nmany) Ed Miliband has \ufb01nally started\na movement away from that \ufb01ctional\n\u2018centre\u2019. \u2018Fictional\u2019, I say because of\nTariq Ali\u2019s point about an \u2018extreme\ncentre\u2019, extreme because this \u2018centre\u2019\nunquestioningly accepts principles\nthat good \u2018centrists\u2019 like Margaret\nThatcher had to \ufb01ght tooth and nail\nfor. The recent anti-Blairite \u2018witchhunt\u2019 is also a good thing by my\nbook (if that is really what it is) and if\naccompanied by a change in face is an\nequivalent change in policy.\nI mentioned earlier that it was\nto the credit of the Mail that they\nhad revived Professor Miliband for\nanother generation. He is perhaps\nthe one subject whose actuality has\nbeen somewhat e\ufb00aced in the whole\ndiscussion, appropriated as it has\nbeen for political purposes (not least\nby myself). It is therefore with great\nadmiration that I close with the \ufb01nal\nlines Professor Miliband\u2019s own short\nencomium to the aforementioned\nHarold Laski in New Left Review:\n\u2018\u2018Philip Rie\ufb00 has a nice phrase about\nFreud having \u2018disturbed the sleep of\nmankind\u2019. No such large claim can\nbe made for Harold Laski. But he\ndid greatly disturb the sleep of many\npeople in Britain and the United States\nin the thirties and forties. He was an\nexemplary public intellectual. There is\ngreat need for more such intellectuals\non the Left today\u201d.\n\u201cThat the article\nwas written to\nvilify is in no\ndoubt. The actual\nresult has been,\non the other hand,\npositive.\u201d\n\n"

The opponent in\nquestion was UCL\u2019s 2nd XI. Extra\nemphasis was placed on this \ufb01xture,\nas the 1st XI would be playing UCL at\nleast 3 times this season. A message\nneeded to be sent out, loud and clear.\nHowever, not even Mystic Meg could\npredict what happened next.\nThe pitch was in good condition,\ndespite being as damp as Omar\nAmjad\u2019s back after a brisk walk, due to\nheavy rain the night before. Imperial\nkicked o\ufb00, and initially UCL were\nstrong, battled well, and held their\nground admirably. However their\nresistance was ended as early as three\nminutes into the game. Good work\nfrom Pete \u2018iNuge\u2019 Nugent released\nwinger James Murphy down the left\nwing, who ate his opposition right\nback for breakfast, before putting in\na delightful left-footed cross to an\nunmarked Dale at the back post, who\ncalmly nodded it in without even\nnodding. The pace had been set.\nThe \ufb02oodgates immediately opened,\nand before the UCL keeper could\neven wipe the sweat o\ufb00 his brow,\nMurphy had put 4 past him. One\nin particular was an exquisite \ufb01rst\ntime curler into the bottom right-hand corner, reminding spectators of\nSouthampton forward Ricky Lambert.\nFresher Alexis Bellot switched up\nfrom his handy hold-up play up front\nto latch on to a through ball, reaching\nit just before the chasing keeper and\ndinking it through his legs and into\nthe net. The game had been set up as\nthree 30 minute thirds, and when the\nwhistle blew to signal the end of the\n\ufb01rst period, the score stood at 6-0.\nTalk could be heard amongst the UCL\nplayers \u2013 they may as well have been\ndebating whether or not to abandon\nthe usual 11-man set up so that one of\nthem could be situated in their goal as\na dedicated ball boy to fetch it out of\nthe net.\nThe next third wasn\u2019t quite as\nriveting, as Captain Robinson took\nthe opportunity to try out an untested 3-5-2 formation. Only two\ngoals were plundered. The \ufb01rst came\nfrom Murphy once again skinning the\nright back alive, before going down\nin the box in a way that would bring\na solitary tear to Gareth Bale\u2019s eye.\nSome say Mick the grounds man had\npicked him out with a ri\ufb02e all the\nway from the Pavilion, others say he\nhad a sudden ridiculous urge to take\na closer look at the diverse range of\nwildlife in the grass, which he had\nso informatively told us about many\na time last season. Will Wilson was\nhanded the ball and stepped up to do\nthe job. After checking his hair was in\norder,hecalmlyslotteditinthebottom\nleft hand corner to \ufb01nally open his\naccount for ICUAFC. Unfortunately\nhe immediately closed said account,\nstating on the form that he couldn\u2019t\naccept the goal due to the fact that\nit was a friendly. Whether he will\nregret his decision later in the season\nremains to be seen. Later in the third,\nmid\ufb01elder Ahmed Cherif received a\nswift but brutal knee to the buttocks\nfrom an understandably aggravated\nUCL player, ending his afternoon, and\nforcing two squads of players to watch\nhim hobble o\ufb00 the pitch, whilst trying\nto hide his identity. Another goal soon\ncame as a result of an absolute blunder\nfrom their keeper, spilling a simple\npick up, allowing Bellot to pounce and\nsend him back into his net to pick the\nball up for an eighth time.\nDue to the fact that only two goals\nhad been put past them in the second\nthird, UCL went into the break\nreasonably happy, with something\napproaching a smile appearing on\nsome of their faces. Captain Robinson\nnoted this and told his team that\nhe wasn\u2019t having any of it, before\nsubbing himself on to score four goals\nin the last thirty minutes. Amongst\nRobinson\u2019s run of goal-scoring form,\nfresher Maximilian Vieweg scored\na lovely goal on the turn, beginning\nwith his back to goal, swiftly pivoting\n180 degrees before burying it in the\nbottom corner.\nThe match ended 13-0, with UCL\nsent packing with their tails \ufb01rmly\nbetween their legs. Some say it was\ncomparable to the mating of ducks.\nThere may have even been a few\nretirements from association football\nthat day.\nAs for Imperial, it was job done, and\nthey head into their \ufb01rst competitive\nmatch of the season in the best form\npossible.\nICUAFC\n\n"

You see there\u2019s\nno real theme, no rhyme or reason to\nwhat I do. Both of the maths books I\u2019ve\nwritten I would like to revisit and have\nanother run at some of the chapters.\nFor students at Imperial they may be\n\ufb01ne, but my audience is the general\nreader. This book was pretty easy, but\nthe big challenge was working out the\nmake-up of this one. The \ufb01rst draft had\nsix big chapters covering topics like\nLisa and her more rational approach\nin the show, and another chapter on\nthe role of pi \u2013 which turns up now\nand then in various episodes. However,\nwhen I was on the plane to the USA to\nmeet the writing sta\ufb00 of the show I decided to reconstruct the entire book it\ninto eighteen shorter chapters to make\nit more pacey and digestible. I had to\nmake sure it had the write balance of\nthe writers stories, the history of the\nmaths involved and why maths minded\nwriters may be funny.\nCG: As someone with a PhD in particle physics, and having written several popular science and maths bestsellers how much did you yourself\nlearn about maths purely through\nresearching all the Simpsons Maths\nEaster eggs?\nSS: I had never really thought deeply\nabout what fractals were before. When\nexplaining how, in an episode of Futurama, Leela and Prof. Farnsworth go\nfrom being in three dimensions to two\ndimensions after a scienti\ufb01c mishap.\nThis meant they went through a fractal\nlandscape on the way, and so it took me\nsome time to fully understand it so I\ncould explain it in the book.\nCG: Were there any maths references\nyou were taken back by, at the sheer\nincredibility of them being smuggled\nin?\nSS: I just \ufb01nd all of them astonishing -because there\u2019s no reason any of them\nshould be there!\nCG: Did you make any suggestions\nfor Maths jokes or ideas they could\nexplore in any future episodes?\nSS: No. I did ask if they have a mountain of ideas they are trying to get in,\nbut most of these ideas just come from\nnowhere during the writing process.\nJe\ufb00 Westbrook said he had wanted to\nget undecidability into an episode of\nThe Simpsons, but hadn\u2019t worked out\nhow to.\nCG: You talk in the book about the\nwriters and producers having regrets\nabout walking away from a life in\nacademia and research, and most\npeople would be flabbergasted that\ngiven the careers they would feel this\nwas about not following up on sci-ence. Did you find that surprising?\nSS: No, I didn\u2019t actually. I left Physics\nand went to join the BBC where I\u2019d be\nvisiting great laboratories, meeting Stephen Hawking, going to volcanoes with\ngeologists and just seeing so many scientists doing real science, something I\u2019d\nalways wanted to do. And I still think\nthere can\u2019t be anything more wonderful\nthan making a new discovery, of coming up with a breakthrough of making a\nnew invention. But for me I clearly did\nthe right thing; if I had stayed in science I wouldn\u2019t have been a very good\nscientist. My skill set is pretty perfectly\nmatched for what I\u2019ve ended up doing,\nand I think it\u2019s the same for them. What\nelse could they have done but be the\ngreatest comedy writing team in the\nworld? But I can see why there is a little\nbit of them that is sad they that never\ngot to solve any great theorems.\nCG: Did you ever set out to become a\nscience writer?\nSS: No. I took a gap year before my\nundergraduate degree and went and\nworked in industry. That year at the\nresearch centre I worked on semi-con-ductors and integrated circuits. Then\nwhen I was at Imperial I did a summer\nplacement in Delaware at an electrical engineering lab, a position I got\nmostly due to my gap year job. Then I\ngot a PhD working on semi-conductor\ndetectors at Cern, helped enormously\nby my previous placements. I got the\njob at the BBC because I had the PhD,\nand I wouldn\u2019t have got into writing if I\nhadn\u2019t been at the BBC. Looking back\nyou can see a path, but there was no\ngrand plan.\nCG: Do you have any rules or your\nown approach to conveying sometimes heavy-going scientific ideas to\nthe greater public?\nSS: I write the books that I would\nwant to read. I\u2019m interested in history,\nstories, people and heroes; things that\nmake me smile and laugh. I only write\nabout things I \ufb01nd interesting, and I\nreally maintain my sense of interest\nand wonder of things long after their\nnovelty has passed. I assume my readers are bright and curious, but don\u2019t\nassume they are in any way experts.\nCG: Are there any writers who you\ngrew up with, who got you into science and who you aspire to be?\nSS: I think Richard Dawkins is the most\nbeautiful writer, and I really admire\nthat. If anyone asks me to read I always\nrefuse because \ufb01rstly I\u2019m not good at\nreading, but mostly my prose...its just\ndoesn\u2019t sound very good. I admire that,\nbut I don\u2019t aspire to it. Reviews of my\nwork often say \u2018clearly written\u2019\n, they\nnever say \u2018beautifully written\u2019\n.\nCG: You courted a lot of controversy\ngoing after alternative medicine.\nWere you intimidated or nervous to\nbe writing and releasing that book?\nSS: No. My co-writer Edzard Ernst\ndid warn me, as he\u2019d been a professor in that \ufb01eld for ten years. He got\nhate mail, people called him very\nnasty things. He wouldn\u2019t get invited to\nconferences, or get his work accepted\nat them. It never really bothered me\nthough because I don\u2019t have a job. I\nreally appreciate the fact that I can say\nand do what I want; I can stand up at a\nscience communication conference and\nsay \u2018that was an appalling example of\nscience communication, it was waste-ful, pointless and society X should be\nashamed of itself \u2018 because I\u2019m not\nsomeone who has to work with such\na society or apply to them for grant\nmoney in the future.\nCG: Did you consider writing a book\nabout your libel case and subsequent\nlegal reform?\nSS: Yes, I thought about it. It\u2019s a great\nstory of grass roots activism, and a\ngreat story of how you can change the\nlaws within a political system. In a way\nI wish somebody had written it, but I\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s the right book for me.\nFor this kind of adventurous story you\u2019d\nneed someone who could bring out\nthe emotion, and the personal angels\ninvolved.\nCG: Why don\u2019t Maths jokes work in\nbase 8? Because 7 10 11.\nSS: Very good.\nAn interview with Simon Singh\nCalum Grant\nWriter\nDemetri Martin\u2019s first book of drawings is an utterly beguiling read from\nstart to finish. Perhaps it isn\u2019t accurate to say \u2018read\u2019 as there are few\nwords in it- each page is taken up by\na new simple black-and-white line\ndrawing of charming hilarity, ranging from a graph of melted cheese\ntemperature against time (with a\ndiscontinuity at perfect tempera-ture) to a man walking a fish.\nIt is a book that is easily dipped\ninto and out of, with the sheer number and diversity of the sketches\nmeaning that it can be read from\ncover to cover over and over again,\neach time finding something new.\nMost of its comedy is light-hearted\nand observational, so appeals to a\nwide audience, though some of it\nleans towards the slightly more ma-cabre, like the double page spread of\nskulls ending in your own.\nAnyone who is familiar with Demetri Martin as a comedian from his\nmany television broadcasts and\nstand-up shows, will recognise his\ncharming trademark mix of cheer-ful, somewhat silly one liners and\nslightly more satirical and thoughtful sketches. For anyone who isn\u2019t,\nhe can be described succinctly by\nhis list on influences on Wikipedia,\nwhich includes Eddie Izzard and Socrates.\nWith its Venn Diagrams, entertaining questions such as: \u2018why do\nthe lions have to be tamed?\u2019 and off-the-wall equations like \u2018spray tan=\n(vanity + stupidity)aerosol\u2019, this\nbook comes across as the doodles\nof someone trying to make sense of\nlife, albeit someone who doesn\u2019t take\nit too seriously.\nI found myself laughing aloud\nmany times at this book and insistently passing it around to share my\nfavourites. Point Your Face At This is\nsure to make you smile, laugh, and\nthink a little, and would make a perfect gift for almost anyone, especially for yourself!\nPoint your face at this\nEmma Wills\nWriter\n\n"

One point to director\nRichard Eyre for immediate audience\ncaptivation.\nIt turns out that this is early 20th\ncentury Sicily, and the assumedsacri\ufb01ce, Mita, is in fact the young\nwife of rich \u2018Uncle Simone\u2019, forced to\ndance because she is blamed for his\nlack of children.\nIn a nutshell, without giving away\ntoo much of the very little story that\nthere is, Uncle Simone\u2019s niece, Tuzza,\nis jealous that she was not chosen as his\nwife and mother of his children. After\ngetting pregnant by the charming but\nslimey Liol\u00e0, who already has three\nsons by three di\ufb00erent women, Tuzza\npersuades Uncle Simone to declare\nthe child as his own in order to stake a\nclaim in the inheritance that the child\nwould one day gain. Liol\u00e0, being Mita\u2019s\nchildhood friend and star-crossed\nlover, helps her to prevent Tuzza\ngetting away with the devilish plan.\nAs demonstrated by the plot, this\nis not a very profound piece of work.\nAlthough I am unfamiliar with the\noriginal by Luigi Pirandelli, who an\nItalian source informs me was a classic\nauthor that many studied at school,\nthere is not really any need to be\nable to compare it to Tanya Ronder\u2019s\nadaptation for the National. The play\nreally is what it is.\nWhich is, a bunch of Irish actors\nrunning on and o\ufb00 the stage in song,\nlaughter, tears \u2013 but mostly song\n\u2013 with Sicilian hair (mainly dark\ncurls), old-style Italian dress, and a\nMediterranean backdrop. The fact\nthat it obviously was not an Irish\nproduction that was so well-acclaimed\nthat it had to be shipped over to us\nLondoners, but actually Irish culture\nas a centre-point to the adaptation,\nmakes it slightly bizarre.\nI have tried to work this one out.\nObviously, British actors squabbling\nin thick Italian accents and cries of\n\u201cMamma Mia!\u201d or whatever we expect\nItalians to do based on our viewing of\nDolmio adverts probably would not\nhave been very PC.\nIs the Irish element supposed to\nallow us to relate to the social values\nconsidered by the piece yet emphasise\nthe foreign and anachronistic context\nWhat: Die Fledermaus with the\nEnglish National Opera\nWhere: London Coliseum\nWhen: Until 6th Nov 2013\nPrice: Various\nD\nie Fledermaus, the Bat, is\nan operetta by the king of\nthe Viennese waltz, Johann\nStrauss Jr. Operetta, the\nancestor of today\u2019s musicals,\nis an entirely di\ufb00erent a\ufb00air from\nopera. The plots are frivolous and\nfunny and mostly carried through\ndialogue with punctuating musical\nnumbers. Through its development in\nthe 19th century it became extremely\npopular for its crude humour, which\nbordered on the pornographic.\nEventually even professional and\n\u2018serious\u2019 opera houses began to stage\noperetta, albeit in a toned-down style.\nWhen Strauss entered the scene and\nmade the operetta famous in Vienna,\nthe plots were less crude; they were\nfunny for their parodying of social\nvalues. The music he wrote was more\nre\ufb01ned and typically Viennese with\nwaltzes, polkas and other dances in\nthe style that brought him fame in the\ncasinos and ballrooms.\nDie Fledermaus is his masterpiece\nof operetta and the plot is suitably\nabsurd; in revenge for a past practical\njoke, Dr Falke invites Eisenstein, who\nis wanted by the police, to a ball where\nhe must be disguised. Dr Falke also\ninvites Eisenstein\u2019s wife, his maid and\nthe prison governor, all in disguise.\nAt the ball there are some awkwardly\nfunny encounters, but overall the\nmood is celebratory and the company\nsings a tribute to the \u201cking of wines\u201d,\nchampagne. By the \ufb01nal act, everyone\n\ufb01nds themselves in prison where the\njailor too is drunk, but the prank is\nrevealed and everyone lives happily\never after.\nUsually this is a hugely funny and\ncheerful event, but not so at the\nEnglish National Opera. Director\nChristopher Alden has tried to elevate\nthis operetta into the ranks of the\nmost profound of German opera, with\ndisastrous results. This is a production\nin complete con\ufb02ict with itself; the\ntension between the light-hearted\nplot with its sparkling waltzes and\nthe dark and serious aesthetic of the\nproduction are stark and irresolvable.\nThe ever-present bed and the\nimmobile hands of the clock suggest\nthat the action is taking place in\nsomeone\u2019s dream. From this pours\nforth a series of bizarre sequences,\nalways surreal, occasionally funny, but\nsometimes actually horrifying. Large\nsections are confusing, the dialogue\nbarely making sense given the onstage action. Larger stretches still are\nbleak and depressing. The entire \ufb01nal\nact is a black abyss through which\nany trace of humour is sucked as we\nwatch police o\ufb03cers (suspiciously\nresembling the Gestapo) beat people\nand point guns threateningly.\nGiven the staging, the music hardly\nseems worth mentioning; though\nplayed well enough it could hardly\nbe called a waltz at such fast speeds.\nThe cast performed admirably, and I\nam sure the fault for the rather cold\ninterpretations lies with the director.\nAlden has tried to \ufb01nd and present a\npsychological subtext where perhaps\nthere isn\u2019t one, and in the process has\nassassinated operetta. It may have\nbeen possible to \ufb01nd interesting truths\nhere if I\u2019d taken my psychoanalysis\ntextbook and a pen, but the ENO has\npublished the greatest possible of\nuntruths in their own description of\nthe production: \u201cLight-hearted and\ncolourful\u201d. That is everything it was\nsupposed to be, but also everything it\nwasn\u2019t. My advice would be to avoid\nthis.\nthey occur in?\nIt is probably best not to think about\nit too much. In fact, there is little need\nto think about much at all during the\nplay \u2013 but this is no bad thing.\nAlthough it is easy to imagine it\ncould have been controversial in its\nday, there is little else that invokes\nmuch pondering. There seem to be\nno hidden meanings or metaphors,\nand even the songs are so literal\nthat I was slightly taken aback when\none character started singing about\npeeling potatoes for her dinner\nAside from the very few and very\nslight GCSE Drama cringe moments,\nit is a very well directed play. Its\nlight-heartedness is humourous and\ncharming, and although it borders on\nthe cheesiness of what many musicals\nare known for it never falls directly in,\nand even I with an aversion to them\nmanaged enjoyed it.\nCATHERINE ASHMORE\nSong, dance, laughter, tears...\nand Sicilian facial hair. A recipe\nfor musical success!\n\n"

    "content": "9\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 18 OCT\nSCIENCE\n...and releasing a vaccination for malaria\nResults released on the 8th of October revealed that scientists are making\npromising progress in the development of an e\ufb00ective malaria vaccine\ncalled RTS,S. The vaccine could potentially save millions of lives as it\naims to combat one of the world\u2019s\ndeadliest diseases.\nThis mosquito-borne disease kills approximately 660,000 people a year,\nmostly children, and almost all in Africa. The nature of malaria makes it\nextremely hard to vaccinate against\nsince it is caused by protozoal para-sites, which are considerably larger\nand more complex than bacteria and\nviruses.\nThese unwieldy organisms are capable\nof wearing a number of di\ufb00erent protein coats to disguise themselves from\nthe immune system, making them exceptionally di\ufb03cult to detect. It is thus\nessential for the vaccine to protect\nagainst something permanent on the\nsurface of the parasite.\nThe imminent vaccine aims to defend\nagainst Plasmodium falciparum, currently the deadliest strain of malarial\nparasite. P. falciparum, like many other protozoal parasites, follows a speci\ufb01c lifestyle once inside the body.\nInjected through the bite of a female\nanopheles mosquito, the parasite enters the bloodstream and is carried\nstraight to the liver to infect liver cells.\nAt this stage of its lifecycle it is called\na sporozoite and expresses a surface\nprotein called a circumsporozoite.\nResearchers are using this circum-sporozoite molecule to act as part of\nthe immunization. It will be this molecule that the immune cells become\nsensitive to and seek to destroy when\nnext detected within the body.\nUnfortunately for researchers, cir-cumsporozoites alone are not enough\nto provoke a su\ufb03cient immune re-sponse. They must be combined with\nanother antigen to do so.\nThe vaccine in question creates a hybrid of circumsporozoite antigens\nwith Hepatitis B surface antigens and\nan additional immune booster. It is\nthis combination that prompts the\nnecessary immune reaction.\nTrials so far have been promising. The\nrecently released results indicated that\nyoung children (aged 5-17 months at\nthe beginning of the trial) experienced\n46% fewer cases of malaria than those\nimmunized with a control vaccine.\nInfants (aged 6-12 weeks at the beginning of the trial) were reported to experience 27% fewer cases of malaria.\nInitially designed in 1987, it has been\na long time in the making. It is hoped\nthat it will be available for use by\n2016. Whilst not providing complete\nprotection, the sheer number of people su\ufb00ering and dying from malaria\nworldwide, estimated at over 300 million cases, means this is a huge step\nforward.\nLauren Hoskin\nsciencesays.co.uk\nThey don\u02bct suffer like you after a long \ufb02ight, Fiona Hartley explains\nJet lag resistance in mice\nlight-dark cycle at least twice as\nquickly. When the V1a and V1b\nreceptors in wild-type mice were\ntemporarily blocked with chemicals\nthey too recovered from their induced\njet lag quickly (though not quite\nas quickly), confvwirming that the\nmissing receptors are responsible for\nthe accelerated rate of recovery.\nIn addition, the mutant mice did\nnot su\ufb00er any obvious ill-e\ufb00ects to\nCaptiveBredReptileForums\nJet lag is one of those annoyances\nthat stems from living in the modern\nera. Anyone who has \ufb02own to Asia\nor come home to the UK after an\nAmerican holiday recognises its\nunpleasantness. You just have to wait\nfor your body to adjust to the new time\nzone. When evolution was working on\nhumans, it had no foresight regarding\nthe development of the aeroplane, or\nthat it would play havoc with our body\nclock by enabling us to travel across\nthe planet in one or two journeys.\nThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)\nacts as the \u2018master clock\u2019 of the human\nbody. In the SCN there are thousands\nof neurons that regulate the numerous\nbodily functions that run in a 24-hour cycle, which are called circadian\nrhythms. These include your core\nbody temperature, urine output, and\nexpression of genes that a\ufb00ect the\ncircadian clock (unsurprisingly called\nclock genes).\nThe SCN also synchronises these\nrhythms with the outside world. When\nwe pass through several time zones on\na jet plane, our internal clocks become\nmisaligned with external time. Shiftworkers have a similar problem.\nSince some studies suggest that\nshift work increases the risk of heart\ndisease and certain cancers, a way to\ncombat the physiological e\ufb00ects of\nmisaligned circadian rhythms would\nbe signi\ufb01cant to many.\nJet lag was \ufb01rst studied in 1965,\nover a decade after the advent of\npassenger jet services. Since then\nthe condition has eluded a cure. But\nHitoshi Okamura and his colleagues\nat Kyoto University have made a\nbreakthrough in understanding how\nthe neurons in the SCN communicate.\nThis gives scientists greater hope that\nthere could one day be a treatment for\nthe symptoms of jet lag. The group\npublished their study in Science last\nweek.\nArginine vasopressin (AVP) is a\nhormone released by around half of\nthe neurons in the mouse SCN and\ndetected by several receptor proteins.\nThere are also AVP receptors in the\nhuman SCN. In a population of mice,\nthe researchers deleted two AVP\nreceptor genes: V1a and V1b. This\nmade the mice unable to respond\nto AVP. The group then placed this\ngenetically-modi\ufb01ed population and a\nwild-type population of mice on a 12-hour day, 12-hour night light cycle for\ntwo weeks.\nWhen the light cycle was changed to\nmimic an eight hour time di\ufb00erence,\nas occurs when humans su\ufb00er from\njet lag, the \u2018normal\u2019 mice took many\ndays to readjust to the new rhythm.\nHowever, the mice lacking in AVP\nreceptors re-entrained to the new\ntheir internal clocks. Their circadian\nrhythms maintained a normal 24-hour\ncycle. As with a mechanical clock, the\nSCN was able to uphold good timekeeping internally whilst being easily\nresettable in response to external solar\ntime.\nIt will still be very di\ufb03cult to create\na magic pill capable of treating jet\nlag thanks to the presence of AVP\nreceptors throughout the body.

Despite brave\ndefensive work the pressure did not\nlet up and Imperial went into half time\nfour tries down.\nPutting the result out of their minds,\nImperial\u2019s players refocused in\nthe second half and, with the help\nof senior players coming o\ufb00 the\nbench, produced a much-improved\nperformance. Organisation and\ndiscipline paid o\ufb00 as Imperial scored\ntwice late in the game and at the \ufb01nal\nwhistle left the \ufb01eld in positive spirits.\nFollowing this summer\u2019s BUCS ruling\nthat forced the merger in name of\nImperial and the Medics, Imperial\nCollege 3rd XV arrived at Shenley\nSports ground in their new guise as\nImperial 6th XV shortly before the\nmonstrous convoy of UCL coaches.\nThe Imperial line-up featured many\nfresh faces, all of whom were keen\nto prove their credentials. After a\nwarm up led by new captain Luke\n\u2018The Angel of the North\u2019 Armitage\nand part time rugby coach/full time\nTechtonic crooner James Hayward,\nthe game started. Imperial kicked o\ufb00\nImperial rally in defeat to UCL\nLuke Armitage reports as Imperial\u02bcs 6th XV rugby team lose 42-12.\nbut were pegged back by their main\nrivals almost instantly. UCL made\naround 40 yards and, after some savvy\no\ufb04oads, scored their \ufb01rst try. The\nImperial back line was overwhelmed\nby the strong running of the huge\ncentres who looked as though they\nwere capable of playing higher level\nrugby. The \ufb01rst half was a generally\ndisheartening encounter for Imperial,\nwith UCL running in 3 more tries to\nleave the score 26-0.\nAt half time some impact substitutions\nwere made, with the chemical\n(engineering) brothers themselves\n- \u2018\ufb02air pair\u2019 Colin Matthews and\nAlex Ru\ufb00man - coming on as the\ntwo centres to give some much-needed experience and attacking\nprowess. Imperial showed signs of\nimprovement, but despite this UCL\nmanaged to score again.\nWith heads going down, singer/\nsongwriter Hayward stepped in with\nsome rousing words and stirred the\nboys up for a \ufb01nal push. Prop Hugh\nMacKinnon had to come o\ufb00 injured,\nforcing disgruntled Italian bus driver\nEdoardo \u2018Bunga Bunga\u2019 Cavallazzi to\ncome on as a replacement Loosehead\nProp. This was despite his pre-game\ndeclaration to his captain that if he\nwere forced to play in the front row he\nwould resign.\nThe forwards pulled together and\nstarted to play the famous \u2018Imperial\nPattern\u2019 making full use of the pitch.\nAfter some clever kicks from Flyhalf Alex Leonard, Imperial found\nthemselves inside the UCL 22m\nline. After many strong phases of\ntraditional attacking rugby later, a\nruck formed close to the UCL try\nline. A crash ball from Jasper popped\nby the \u2018short controller\u2019 Armitage\nwas enough to send UCL defenders\n\ufb02ying and Jasper touched down to\ngive Imperial a consolation try. With\nspirits visibly lifted Imperial gave\neverything in their power to not\nconcede any more points and pushed\nhard again. Some minutes later IC\nconstructed a rolling maul very near\nto the UCL try line, with Jonno \u2018top\nscorer\u2019 Stancombe holding onto the\nball like a bear to honey at the back.\nAs he has done so often for Imperial,\nStancombe spotted the big white line,\nand made a dive for it, putting the ball\nsafely on the \ufb02oor. Leonard slotted the\nconversion, leaving the \ufb01nal score 42-12, a better-looking score than what\nlooked likely at half time.\nAn unfortunate result to open the\nseason but with plenty to build\non, Geordie Captain Armitage\ncongratulated the team on a \u2018canny\ndecent\u2019 performance.\nCongratulations on an encouraging\nperformance to all the freshers,\nincluding debut \ufb02anker and man of\nthe match Yix Lin.\nICURFC\nBUCS Home Fixtures\n23rd October 2013\nBADMINTON\nMEN\u02bcS 2ND VS SUSSEX\n13:00\nETHOS\nMEN\u02bcS 3RD (MEDICS) VS CHICHESTER\n17:00\nHARROW CLUB\nBASKETBALL\nMEN\u02bcS 3RD VS WEST LONDON\n15:00\nETHOS\nFENCING\nWOMENS 2ND VS QUEEN MARY\n14:00\nETHOS\nFOOTBALL\nMENS 1ST VS ESSEX\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 4TH VS BUCKINGHAMSHIRE\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 6TH VS CARDIFF MET\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nGOLF\nMIXED 1ST VS MERRIST WOOD COLLEGE\n11:30\nEALING GOLF CLUB\nHOCKEY\nWOMENS 2ND (MEDICS) VS UCL\nTIME TBA\nINDIAN GYMKHANA\nWOMENS 5TH (MEDICS) VS BRUNEL\nTIME TBA\nINDIAN GYMKHANA\nMENS 1ST VS CANTERBURY\n13:30\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 5TH VS READING\n15:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 6TH (MEDICS) VS SURREY\n16:30\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 7TH VS LSE\n18:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nLACROSSE\nMENS 1ST VS ESSEX\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nWOMENS 2ND VS ESSEX\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nNETBALL\nWOMENS 4TH VS HERTFORDSHIRE\n17:00\nETHOS\nWOMENS 5TH (MEDICS) VS\nQUEEN MARY\nTIME TBA\nVENUE TBA\nWOMENS 6TH VS BRUNEL\nTIME TBA\nVENUE TBA\nRUGBY UNION\nWOMENS 1ST VS CHICHESTER\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 1ST VS BRIGHTON\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMENS 5TH (MEDICS) VS\nST GEORGE\u02bcS\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nMEN\u02bcS 6TH VS\nBPP UNIVERSITY COLLEGE\n14:00\nHARLINGTON SPORTS GROUND\nSQUASH\nMENS 2ND VS SURREY\n14:00\nETHOS\nMENS 3RD VS QUEEN MARY\n16:30\nETHOS\nTENNIS\nWOMENS 2ND VS LSE\n13:00\nBISHOPS PARK\nMENS 3RD VS UCL\n13:00\nBROCKWELL PARK\nWATER POLO\nWOMENS 1ST VS SOUTHAMPTON\nTIME TBA\nVENUE TBA\nMENS 1ST VS SOUTHAMPTON\nTIME TBA\nVENUE TBA\nINSIDE\nImperial slot 13 past hapless UCL\n\n"

We Will Rock You\n(based on the songs of \u2018Queen\u2019 and\nwritten by Ben Elton) and Jersey Boys\n(based on the songs of \u2018The Four Seasons\u2019) have since followed to enduring\nsuccess. Sunshine on Leith, originally\na 2007 Dundee Repertory Theatre\nproduction, takes on the more modest body of work of 80s Scottish band\n\u2018The Proclaimers\u2019.\nThe film starts in a grim land torn\napart by religious sectarianism. No,\nnot Scotland; Afghanistan. David\n(MacKay) and Ally (Guthrie) are soldiers sitting inside an armoured vehicle that takes a hit from a roadside\nbomb. It then cuts to David and Ally\nreturning to families and friends in\ntheir hometown of Leith in north Edinburgh. The film focuses on the tribulations of Ally\u2019s resumed relationship\nwith David\u2019s sister Liz (Mavor), David\u2019s new one with Yvonne (Thomas),\nand David\u2019s parents Rab (Mullen) and\nJean (Horrocks) 25 year old one.\nIt\u2019s an interesting second effort from\nnorth London actor-turned-director\nDexter Fletcher; a Scottish musical isn\u2019t a natural stepping stone for\nsomeone best known for his role in\ncockney crime film Lock, Stock and\nTwo Smoking Barrels. As far as musicals go, it\u2019s a competent attempt.\nHe gets the characters broadly right,\nthough the only one who stands out\n-Art museum manager Harry (Lock,\nStock co-star Jason Flemyng)- gets\nfar too little screen time. On the other\nhand, a friend of David and Ally\u2019s who\nlost both legs in the roadside bomb\n(Brannigan) is a misguided attempt at\nhamfisting an extra dose of drama into\nthe film.\nThe film does succeed where far too\nmany jukebox musicals fail: the transition into song feels natural, as opposed to going to ridiculous lengths to\nfit in as many of the band\u2019s songs (We\nWill Rock You has characters named\nGalileo Figaro and Scaramouche).\nIt presents itself as a tongue-in-cheek take on Scottish culture; with\njokes on Scottish nationalism, Leithbased football club Hibernian, AngloScottish relations and a liberal use of\n\u201cAye\u201d. But beneath this charismatic\nCaledonian veneer; at the film core\u2019s\nis a standard musical with all of its\nquirks, tropes and style, a bombastic\nBroadway style that The Proclaimers\u2019\nfolksy songs do not lend themselves\nwell to.\nIf you dislike musicals you might\ntake solace in the snappy dialogue and\nchemistry between the characters, but\nultimately it\u2019s an fulfilling outing. For\nmusical fans it\u2019s an enjoyable, albeit\nforgettable musical. Unfortunately for\nme, I am in the former.\nWe\u2019ve got a busy week planned for\nyou! First up as a special postgrad\nscreening night-including a free\nbag of popcorn/ice cream may I just\nadd-we\u2019ll be showing the newest adaptation of The Great Gatsby with\nan all-star cast featuring Leonardo\nDiCaprio as Jay Gatsby and Carey\nMulligan as Daisy Buchanan. Baz\nLuhrmann brings plenty of glitz and\nglam to this classic tale about the\ndark trappings of a life of luxury.\nNext up is the visually awe-in-spiring Pacific Rim for your viewing pleasure. Guillermo Del Toro\n(creator of the extraordinary gothic\nfairytale Pan\u2019s Labyrinth) brings his\nunique blend of visceral imagery\nand technical brilliance to life in a\nhuge blockbuster with spectacular\nresults. And as for the plot, in brief:\ncities across the globe are coming\nunder attack by mythical beasts so\nmankind creates colossal robots\nto fight back. If this all seems a little similar to a certain Michael Bay\nfranchise, think again; Pacific Rim\nis devoid of the cynicism of recent\nblockbusters: it\u2019s irresistibly fun as\nan overt ode to Del Toro\u2019s love of\nanime as well as having a heart of\ngold.\nAnd now for something a bit\ndifferent: we\u2019ll be screening a\ndocumentary of the documentary\nProject Wild Thing by local\nfilmmaker David Bond. We follow\nBond as he explores the growing\ndisconnection of British Children\nfrom nature. As he witnesses the\ndetrimental impact that marketing\nand endless hours of TV have on\nhis own children he decides to\ntake action with simultaneously\nhumorous and shocking results.\nWe\u2019re showing a free screening\nof The Gamers: Hands of Fate,\nfor anyone not familiar with The\nGamers series, they\u2019re a series of\ncomedies set in the role-playing\ngaming universe with plenty of in\njokes about the gaming world.

It is about the effect new technologies will have on the centuries-old\nmovie industry; it is about the nature\nof copyright, and the ownership of an\nactor\u2019s image; but most of all it is about\nhow older actresses are treated in a\nworld where youth is king, and you\u2019re\nonly as good as your last facelift. \u2018How\nold are you now? 45? 48?\u2019, asks Jeff, a\nslightly sleazy executive at \u2018Miramax\u2019\nStudios, played beautifully by Danny\nHuston. \u201844.\u2019, replies a defensive Robin Wright, who plays an alternative\nversion of herself. In this film, Robin\nWright, rather than continuing her\nascent to stardom following her portrayal of Jenny in the 1994 film Forrest\nGump, has stagnated; let down by her\nquick temper and neurosis, she has\nmade a series of poor decisions and\neven poorer films, that eventually lead\nher to the door of Miramax Studios.\nIt is here that she is offered a deal\nshe cannot refuse: the studio will scan\nevery part of her, completely owning her image, and freezing her at the\ngolden age of 34, but in return she will\nbe banned from acting for the next\n20 years. Fearing for the financial security of her children, one of whom\nis going slowly blind and deaf, Robin\nagrees, allowing her essence to be condensed into a computer chip. For the\nnext 20 years the studio make films using this \u2018virtual Robin\u2019, catapulting her\ninto the \u2018highest-earning computer\nstar\u2019 in the world, until she is invited\nback to the studios for the \u2018Futurological Congress\u2019 alluded to in the film\u2019s\ntitle. This congress is a chance for Miramax (who have since made a move\ninto pharmaceuticals and changed\ntheir name to MIramax-Nagasaki) to\nshow off their latest creation - a hallucinogenic drug that sends users into\nthe \u2018animated zone\u2019, where everyone is\nfree to live out their wildest desires.\nIt is at this point, around the halfway\nmark, that the film takes a sudden left\nturn, plunging us into an animated\nworld of rainbow seas, robot butlers,\nand famous personalities; as Robin\nenters her hotel, she sees Frida Kahlo\ntaking a bite of Magritte\u2019s apple, while\nZiggy Stardust chats to John Wayne,\nand the receptionist informs her that\nshe is the sixth Robin Wright today.\nSuch mediations on who owns a person\u2019s image may seem abstract, but\nraises important issues about whether\nthe actor is a person or a brand. This\nidea is taken further when the head\nof Miramax - who I suspect is somewhat based upon Steve Jobs - reveals\nthat the next step in their development is to distill \u2018Robin Wright\u2019 down\ninto a single molecule, which can then\nbe ingested, allowing the consumer\nto place the character in any situation they can think of. Although this\nis clearly extreme, it draws a parallel\nwith how much free choice the actors\nactually have, and how much is dictated by the studio.\nWhen all these philosophical quandaries have been stripped away, what\nwe have left is a breathtakingly gorgeous film; the animation style is\nsomewhere between 1930 Disney,\nGeorge Dunning\u2019s Yellow Submarine,\nand Satoshi Kon\u2019s Paprika - a beguiling mixture of whimsy, humour, and\nriotous colour, that stands as a marked\ncontrast to director Ari Folman previous film Waltz With Bashir, a gritty,\nstark feature about the Lebanon War.\nThe Congress is a feast for the senses,\nwith an incredible attention to detail\nthat merits it a second viewing.\nHowever, in making a film with\nsuch a complex and meta plot Folman\nseems to have stretched himself a little thin; towards the end of the film\nthings are left unexplained, and major plot points seem to pass us by too\nquickly. Despite being over two hours\nlong, The Congress leaves us with\nmore questions than answers, but perhaps this is to be expected in a work\nso wide in scope. It still remains that\nThe Congress is a film that isn\u2019t afraid\nto bite the hand that feeds, working as\na vicious satire of the movie industry,\nwhile boasting some of the most trip-py visual feats this side of the 80s, and\na powerhouse performance by Robin\nWright - A definite must-see.\nFred Fyles\nWriter\nThe Congress\nDirector: Ari Folman\nWriter: Ari Folman\nStarring: Robin Wright, Harvey\nKeitel, Jon Hamm, Paul Giamatti,\nDanny Huston\nRuntime: 120 minutes\nImperial Cinema\n\n"

    "content": "6 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nPhilippa Skett gives us an exciting history lesson about the Hig\nHigg\u2019s-tory through the ages:\nCERN\nL\nast week saw the Nobel Prize\nin Physics go to Peter Higgs\nand Francois Englert for their\ntheorisation of the Higg\u2019s\nBoson, only months after its\ncon\ufb01rmed detection at CERN. The\ncontroversially named \u201cGod Particle\u201d\nhas delivered excitement (and mass)\nto both the scienti\ufb01c community\nand the general public, with the\ntale behind this unassuming boson\nfeaturing the twists and turns of a race\nin science never seen before. It is also\na story with many leading roles, but\nwho deserved the prize at the end is\nstill a matter of debate.\nIt all began in 1964 when Peter\nHiggs, a physicist from the University\nof Edinburgh, suggested particles take\nmass from an invisible energy \ufb01eld,\nand, as this \ufb01eld needed an associated\nparticle, he suggested that a boson\nmust also exist. Detection of the boson\nwould in turn provide a\ufb03rmation of\nthe Standard Model, a theory of the\nfundamental interactions between\nsubatomic particles. The boson was\nessentially a missing piece of a large\nparticle puzzle, that without it could\nnot con\ufb01rm some of the key ideas that\nunderlie theoretical physics.\nPeter Higgs was the \ufb01rst of several\nresearchers to publish a paper\ntheorising the boson\u2019s existence,\nincluding our very own Professor Tom\nKibble from the Blackett laboratory.\nUnfortunately, the paper Tom Kibble\nwrote, alongside other researchers\nGerald Guralnik and Carl Richard\nHagen, was the last to be published\nin the Physics journal Physical Review\nLetters about the topic, costing him\nthe Nobel Prize. Although he stated\nthat he regards \u201c[his] treatment as\nthe most thorough and complete,\u201d he\nsadly was a few months too late.\nAfter the theorisation of the boson,\nmore scientists stepped forward to\ncontribute to the function of this\nmysterious particle. Steven Weinberg,\nan American professor of physics\nat Harvard University, suggested\nthe idea that the boson will provide\nthe uni\ufb01cation of electromagnetic\nand weak forces, two of the four\nfundamental interactions within\nnature. Not only that, but Gerard \u2018t\nHooft, a Dutch physicist and professor\nat Utrecht University, based in the\nNetherlands, built on this by proving\nit mathematically.\nHooft went on to win the Nobel\nPrize for this in 1999; the boson, even\nthough still theoretical at this point,\nwas already demanding international\ninterest and delivering awards unlike\nany other.\nIt was in this time that the term\n\u201cGod Particle\u201d was coined by Leon\nLederman, an American experimental\nphysicist. He coined the term \u201cGod\nParticle\u201d in the title of a popular\nscience book he wrote because that,\n\u201cOne, the publisher wouldn\u2019t let us\ncall it the Goddamn Particle, though\nthat might be a more appropriate title,\ngiven its villainous nature and the\nexpense it is causing. And two, there\nis a connection, of sorts, to another\nbook, a much older one...\u201d\nThe media loved it, much to\nthe dismay of Higgs himself; not\nbecause his name itself became\nsomewhat neglected, but because\nof the sensationalist connotations\nthis presented. Humbly, he himself\nwould rarely refer to the particle in\nquestion as either the God Particle\nor the Higg\u2019s Boson \u2013 displaying\nmore than a modicum of modesty\noften undetected in today\u2019s scienti\ufb01c\nresearchers.\nAs speculation and controversy\nsurrounding the so-called \u201cGod\nParticle\u201d ebbed and \ufb02owed through\nthe media, scientists were now\nburrowed away from prying eyes\nand had began to design and build\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nThis was to become the largest, most\npowerful particle collider, and, with\na price tag of $8 billion, was the most\nexpensive too. Its overall function was\nto test and predict various theories\nwithin particle physics, but excitement\naround the LHC was centred on the\nidea that one day it could allow for the\ncreation of a Higgs Boson.\nThe LHC was constructed between\n1983 and 1988, and crossed between\nSwitzerland and France at four\npoints throughout its 27km long\ncircumference. It o\ufb03cially went\nlive on the 19th of September 2008,\nsending protons whizzing through the\ntunnels at speeds of only 3 metres per\nsecond slower than the speed of light\nand them making 11,000 complete\nrevolutions of the main ring per\nsecond.\nIt seemed that the \ufb01nal hurdle to\novercome in this theoretical physics\nrace was to actually detect the boson,\nalthough this was categorically easier\nsaid than done. To do this, two\nseparate, opposing teams of scientists\nhuddled away at CERN in Geneva,\nSwitzerland, to independently\ndiscover this elusive particle. The two\nteams, Atlas and CMS, were named\nafter the two gigantic detectors built\ninto the Large Hadron Collider that\ncould measure the outputs of proton\nparticles being smashed together at\nhigh speeds.\nThe collisions were predicted to\nproduce the boson that would then\nimmediately decay into a multitude\nof di\ufb00erent subatomic particle\ncombinations, including lots of excess\nenergy in the form of gamma rays. A\nboson is an elementary particle that\ncan mediate forces between other\nbodies, such as the electromagnetic\n\ufb01eld, or the strong force that binds\nFran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter W. Higgs at Cern before a conference about the search for the Higg\u02bcs boson\n\n"

The huge\ncosts and overheads in fundraising, as well as\nthe need to give up an entire summer are o\ufb00putting factors, and it seems to have taken a while\nfor charities to get their heads around this.\nProject Nepal was set up in 2011 with the aim\nof o\ufb00ering an alternative \u2013exciting, low-cost\nvolunteering opportunities to help out with\nschool building in Nepal. Situated in the Tanahun\ndistrict of Nepal, their chosen school, the Maya\nUniverse, o\ufb00ers education for children up to age\nof 12 from local villages.\nThe Maya Universe group of schools operate in\nrural areas where access to education is limited\nand the incidence of poverty is highest. Their\nphilosophy is that parents should not have to\npay for their children\u2019s\u2019 education, but rather\ncan contribute to the cost of running the school\nby doing maintenance, cooking, gardening and\ncleaning. Whilst this maximises educational\nopportunity, it does mean that there is very little\nmoney available for expansion.\nThis is where Imperial\u2019s volunteers come in.\nThroughout the year, they fundraised through a\nnumber of events, from Mulled Wine evenings\nto charity collections and Krispy Kreme sales.\nThe \u00a38,000 that they raised went toward the cost\nof construction materials and supplies for the\nthree classrooms that they built over the summer\nwhilst in Nepal. Project Nepal is di\ufb00erent from\nmost overseas projects in that the volunteers pay\nfor their own \ufb02ights, and all the money raised\ngoes straight to the people who need it. This\ntransparency and e\ufb03ciency is sadly lacking in\nother, similar trips.\nOver the course of three weeks, the volunteers\nstayed with local families, who they say were\nincredibly friendly. During the day they worked\non the classroom building, and the evenings were\nleft for socialising. Paul Zhu mentions that one\nof the highlights of the trip was playing a sort of\nversion of \u2018capture the \ufb02ag\u2019 on the mountainside,\nin the middle of the jungle covered Himalayan\nfoothills. Weekends were left free for travelling,\nincluding a trip to the amazing town of Pokhara\nin the Annapurna Range.\nThis year 17 volunteers went out with Project\nNepal and the team hope that even more will be\nable to go out next year. Flights were around \u00a3600,\nso the cost to each person was minimal compared\nto similar trips that Imperial students go on. If\nyou are interested in going, or just looking for a\nsmall and friendly group to volunteer with, why\nnot contact them?\npnepal@imperial.ac.uk\nRAG Treasurer\np\np\nI\nn April 2013, a study trip was\norganized jointly by the Imperial\nCollege Entrepreneurs Society\nand the Kings College Business\nClub to allow a delegation of\nstudents of which the author was\npart of to visit startup companies\nand educational institutions based\nin Silicon Valley in California, the\nworld\u2019s foremost IT cluster. The\npurpose was to allow the students\nto educate themselves about the way\ninnovation is managed in large and\nsmall technology based companies\nas well as in the design of university\ncurricula in the hope of bringing\nback the knowledge to enhance our\nremaining time at university as well\nas to explore potential future career\npaths.\nAfter descending upon San\nFrancisco after a long \ufb02ight from\nLondon during a weekend, many were\nkeen to visit the Haight-Ashbury area\nof downtown San Francisco, famed\nfor the summer of love in 1967 as\ndescribed in the song \u201cwhen you\nare going to San Francisco, be sure\nto wear some \ufb02owers in your head\u201d\nby Scott McKenzie in the hope of\nimmersing ourselves in the pioneering\nspirit and get in the right mood before\nthe long week of activities began.\nIt was disappointing to see that the\nfamed hippie district of decades past\nwas only a reminiscent of its former\nself, with tourist shops dominating\nthe street front. If the city still had its\npioneering and liberal spirit intact, it\nwas not to be found here.\nThe week started with a visit to\nMicrosoft in Silicon Valley. Retaining\nthe spirit of innovation as a small\ncompany expands into a big one is a\nchallenge facing many fast growing\nstartups and corporate divisions.\nMicrosoft has attempted to solve\nthis problem by keeping product\ndivisions separate from each other\nand housed in small and open o\ufb03ce\nbuildings around its campus as Barry\nCastle; the product manager for Skype\nexplained on our tour of their Silicon\nValley facilities where Skype and Xbox\ntechnologies are developed.\nThis technique is also used by other\ncompanies we visited such as Google\nand Facebook, housed on large\ncorporate campuses in Mountain\nView. As these two companies are\nbarely older than a decade, great\ne\ufb00orts have been invested to retain\nthe feel of a small company. Both\ncompanies o\ufb00er a great wealth of\nemployee bene\ufb01ts including vehicular\nmaintenance, free food and computer\ngadgets as well as laundry services\nin order to incentivize and motivate\nemployees to stay late and to work\nhard, just like back in university.\nGoogle have their unique o\ufb03ce\ndesign with colorful plastic slides\nreplacing stairs between building\n\ufb02oors and colourful bikes used as\ncampus transportation in Googleplex;\nand tFacebook have their fortnightly\nhackatons for sparking new ideas and\nto keep the creativity \ufb02owing.\nWe also had the opportunity\nto visit some small but up and\ncoming companies to witness the\ninner workings of a company in the\ntransition stages between being a\nventure capital funded small \ufb01rm\nthat is just taking o\ufb00 and a pro\ufb01table\nlarge corporation. Dropbox Inc. that\nis based in the downtown harbour\narea of San Francisco is the typical\nexample where the interiors are\nfull of gadgets, game consoles and\nmusical instruments lifted straight\nout of your average boys childhood\nroom. The company has expanded\nso fast after its recent breakthrough\nthat the helium balloons hovering\nover a new employee\u2019s desk, which\nwere the majority of desks; were still\n\ufb02oating in the air during our visit. It\nwas also especially inspiring to visit\nthe o\ufb03ces of Inkling, a producer of\ndigital interactive science textbooks\nfor university students; of which the\nfounder is a recent Imperial College\ngraduate that moved west to the valley\nwhere VC funding and IT expertise\nwere more plentiful than in the UK.\nThe backbone of Silicon Valley are\nthe people working in the various\ncompanies, and the valley would\nnot be the IT supercluster it is today\nwithout the educational institutions\npresent in the local area such as\nStanford University and the University\nof California Berkeley that produces a\nsigni\ufb01cant part of the human talent\nand spino\ufb00 companies present in the\nvalley today. We had the opportunity\nto participate in a joint discussion\nsession with the Business Association\nof Stanford Entrepreneurial Students\nand were impressed by the way\nthe university has managed to\nintegrate entrepreneurial skills\ntraining and projects into its core\nengineering curriculum in a close-knit collaboration between students,\nfaculty and local companies;\nsomething that British universities\nhave a lot to learn from.\nThe \ufb02ow of people into and out of\nuniversities and between companies\nalso helps to foster a relatively stable\nworking environment by American\nstandards, as well as ensuring that\nskills, ideas and know-how are\nchannelled to the right location in the\ntechnological ecosystem where it has\nthe most potential to succeed.\nThe great journey west to Silicon\nValley has been very inspiring and\ntaught me to dream big and to think\nand approach general problem solving\nin a hands-on and entrepreneurial\nminded way. It will greatly enhance the\nway I do things in my future student\nand engineering career. As I return\nback to Imperial College to \ufb01nish\nmy education, the experiences and\nlessons I bring back will have a real\nimpact in aiding me to think and work\nin a more innovative and free minded\nway in my involvement with projects\nin the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment. As I write these lines\nand re\ufb02ect upon the trip in a corner of\nthe Vesuvio Caf\u00e9 where Jack Kerouac\nand the beat generation movement\nmet and on my last day in the city, it\nseems after all that the revolutionary\nand pioneering spirit that could not\nbe found in Haight-Ashbury has\nmoved across town to SOMA (South\nof Market Street) and Mountain View,\nliving on alive and well in the many\ninnovative startup companies and\neducational institutions based there\nthat are driven by the desire to make\na pro\ufb01t and the aspiration to have an\nimpact on the world.\n*The author would like to extend\nhis gratitude to the sponsors of the\nImperial College Entrepreneurship\nSociety and Kings College Business\nClub, as well as the International\nO\ufb03ce at Imperial College London for\nproviding \ufb01nancial support to realize\nthe study trip.\nGo west, young student\nPatrik Lei\nWriter\nIC ENTREPRENEURS\n\n"

To\ncontinue to bene\ufb01t from the support\nthat the Careers Service can o\ufb00er you\nsimply need to register as an alumnus\nvia the Careers Homepage (www3.\nimperial.ac.uk/careers).\nImperial has an excellent record in\ngraduate employment and the annual\nDestination of Leavers from Higher\nEducation that the Careers Service\nmanages consistently shows Imperial\nGraduates outperforming the rest\nof the UK both in terms of graduate\nemployment statistics and graduate\nstarting salary.\nWe know many of you will have\nsecured yourself graduate level\nemployment and are excitedly waiting\nto take up your new roles wherever\nthat may be.

Moving into\nthe unknown can be daunting but you\nshould look ahead positively. To help\nyou prepare for your new challenge if\nyou are going into the workplace The\nCareers Service has produced a few\ntips for you to consider:\n1/ The basics. Reread your joining\ninstructions from your employer.\nMake sure you know your starting\ntime, work location and any special\ninstructions they have given. Often\non your \ufb01rst day you will need to\nbring in various forms and documents\nto enable to you become a formal\nmember of sta\ufb00. Usually this will\ninvolve a trip to the Human Resource\nDepartment to drop of forms and\ncollect your identity card (and you\nthought you had left that all behind\nyou when you took your College card\no\ufb00 for the last time!)\n2/ Be yourself, but be your positive\nself. Your \ufb01rst few days in your new\nworkplace will involve meeting people.\nLots of people. Be friendly and polite.\nIt will be tiring but the impression you\ngive to your new colleagues during\nyour \ufb01rst few days will last.\n3/ Show a positive attitude toward\nthe tasks that you are given. It is likely\nthat your \ufb01rst few weeks will involve an\ninduction and this will vary according\nto the size of the organisation you have\njoined. It could be a full programme\nlasting weeks where you will undergo\nspeci\ufb01c training on the systems in use\nand the various di\ufb00erent procedures\nthat you will have to become familiar\nwith. Some of it may involve days, half\ndays or a few hours out of your normal\nplace of work. Smaller organisations\nmay not have such a formal structure\nbut you should expect an introduction\nto colleagues, systems and all the\nrelevant health and safety information\nthat are required to keep you safe in\nthe workplace.\n4/ Be realistic. You will have only\njust started and you cannot expect\nto know it all. Show a willingness to\nundertake tasks but don\u2019t be afraid to\nask for help and clari\ufb01cation if you are\nunsure. Your new colleagues will be\nwilling to explain more and help you\ngain con\ufb01dence in your new role.\n5/ Enjoy. You will be exposed to a\nlot of new experiences, people and\nsystems. Take some time to re\ufb02ect\non your \ufb01rst few months in your new\nrole and look forward to building\na successful and rewarding career.\nBefore long you will be meeting up\nwith your fellow alumni for a 1 year get\ntogether!

    "content": "19\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 18 OCT\nMUSIC\nChillin\u2019 in fanboy heaven\nStuart Masson reviews Mountain Goats at the Union Chapel\nhe Mountain Goats are\nprobably my favourite\nmusical artist. From the\nearly years of just John\nDarnielle with a guitar and\na tape recorder right through to the\ncurrent three piece iteration I am an\nembarrassingly large fanboy. So, a few\nmonths back, when they announced\nthey were playing at the Union Chapel,\none of my favourite venues, I snapped\nup tickets the moment they came\non sale. So last Tuesday I descended\nupon Islington with a heavy sense\nof excitement. After an excellent\nopening set by singer-songwriter\nAlessi\u2019s Ark, I was expecting the show\nto end all shows.\nFor this show they had been\nreduced to just John Darnielle and\nbassist Peter Hughes. This limited\nthe set somewhat, since several\ntracks (including most of the choice\ncuts from the new album) don\u2019t\nreally work without drums, as John\nhimself admitted to one particularly\nadamant heckler. It did mean we were\ntreated to a few more old numbers\nthough, which is always a good thing.\nConsidering the total repertoire\nnumbers around 600 songs, I was\noverjoyed when I realised that an intro\ndescribing at length the role of the\nrunning back in an American football\nT\nAMS album of the week\nWhilst we were all fussing\nover the hottest and driest\nsummer since 2006, something\nradiant happened on the infinitely more weather-blessed\nWest Coast of the US. I\u2019m not\ntalking about the small yet progressive steps our darling cousins are taking for gay rights,\nbut I am in fact referring to the\nrelease of Capital Cities\u2019 true\ngem of a debut album, Iwn a\nTidal Wave of Mystery.\nThe lyrical duo of Capital Cities, Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian (a fabulous name only rivalled by his cracking beard), have produced an album in which you will be taken on a veritable journey of\nupbeat and feel-good electro inspired creations paired with languid\nand well-written indie tunes. Their success in producing a diverse album makes for an interesting and refreshing listen with great promise for their future. [Inb4 jack of all trades]\nOur opinion of music is often affected by the everyday, non-sonic\nstimuli. For example, if we are experiencing the joys of love there\nare certain songs that appeal to us and if the artist has fallen on\nhard times then that can very much be apparent in the music. In this\ncase, I believe my opinion of the vocals is buoyed somewhat by the\npalpable bond between Ryan and Sebu. In fact, this album is chock\nfull of jaunty, get up and go tunes which make you just want to grab\nyour bff (Safe and Sound, Origami). If you end up liking this album\u2019s\nvibe, check out their really funky covers of the classics Stayin\u2019 Alive,\nHoliday and Nothing Compares 2 U.\nFor those interested in music videos, Safe and Sound is certainly\nworth its weight in gold. [On a charming aside, if anyone is a fan\nof vsauce you will be familiar with how one might weigh a music\nvideo] Ok I digress. Anyway, at first you think, \u201cAh! Dance styles\nfrom throughout the ages and two chaps dancing ecstatically celebrating their successful foray into the music scene; that\u2019s cool.\u201d But\nupon further investigation (and I owe this insight to a particularly\nobservant and savvy West Coast gal) you realise that there was real\ntalent behind the elegant and seamless combination of the footage\nfor the music video which produces a simply incredible visual feast.\nI will bring this review to a close with a tip of my top hat to the\npromising Ryan and Sebu for this joy, thank you.\nCapital Cities \u2013 In a Tidal Wave of Mystery\nGeorge Spence-Jones\ngame meant that they were about to\nplay my favourite Mountain Goats\ntrack: Fall of the Star High School\nRunning Back. An incredibly rare\nperformance of early cassette-only\nEP track Going to Monaco (I did say\nI was a huge fanboy\u2026) was also pretty\nspectacular. There were also stunning\nperformances of Up the Wolves, Woke\nUp New and See America Right. I was\nalso blown away by some tracks I\u2019m\nnot obsessed with. Both Maybe Sprout\nWings and Wild Sage were far more\nbeautiful in the live setting whilst\nnew album track The Diaz Brothers\n\ufb01nally clicked for me. There was also\na \ufb01rm reminder that John is yet to\nput out the best song he\u2019s written in a\nfew years in his ode to a bullied kid at\nschool, You Were Cool.\nSadly, this wasn\u2019t the show to end\nall shows. Peter Hughes\u2019 bass guitar\nrefused to make sound during the\n\ufb01rst track, which proved distracting\nto John as well as the audience. It did\nlead to an impromptu solo performance of Jenny though, so I suppose\nI can\u2019t be too annoyed about it. What\nI maintain my right to be annoyed\nabout is the piano portion of the show.\nI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because John\nisn\u2019t as good at writing for piano, or as\ngood at playing piano, or if I just don\u2019t\nlike the three songs he played on piano (it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely the last one) but the\ncomplete lack of energy during these\nsongs really killed o\ufb00 the momentum\nfor me. The fact that I felt bored at\nany point of a Mountain Goats show\nwould be a shock to most of my closest friends, but that\u2019s how it was. I left\nthe show feeling a bit disappointed,\nbut looking back on the setlist, I real-Music Newsround\nise that I absolutely loved every single\nsecond that John was holding a guitar.\nIt was just this tepid rendition of a few\nsongs o\ufb00 the extremely boring The\nLife of the World to Come that didn\u2019t\nhit the spot with me.\nAll in all, it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m never going to enjoy the perfect Mountain Goats gig unless they let me pick\nthe setlist. In terms of \u201cbig hits\u201d we\ngot Dance Music but there was no\nThis Year or No Children, which was a\nbit of a shame. Of course, once you\u2019ve\nwritten 600 songs, you\u2019re always going to have to cut some of them, so it\u2019s\na bit stupid of me to complain about\ntracks that weren\u2019t played. The setlist\nthat was played was great, and the\nperformance was top of the range. I\nsuppose when you love something\nthis much, it\u2019s hard not to be upset\nwith the smallest \ufb02aw.\nSnoop Dogg/Lion has re-branded himself as Snoopzilla for a funk project with Stones Throw maestro, Dam\nFunk. The duo are calling themselves 7 Days of Funk and will\nrelease a self-titled album on 10th December.\nCoolio dropped in on a student \ufb02at in Preston to cook a three-course meal and perform an extra special rendition of \u201cGangster\u2019s\nParadise\u201d, accompanied by some bloke on a guitar.\nThe \ufb01rst band performing at Glastonbury 2014 has been an-nounced. Stanton Warriors, the Bristol-based DJ duo will be\nplaying their 10th Glastonbury festival.\nDeath Grips cancelled a tour and festival appearance this Autumn. No reason was given.\nDeath-Row a\ufb03liated rapper and producer Daz Dillinger has issued Rockstar Games with a cease and desist order over alleged\ncopyright theft on the sound track to the new GTA game.\nMetalcore titans Trivium and Killswitch Engage have announced\na double-headline tour in February next year.\n\n"

We support\nthat, but the \ufb01lm doesn\u2019t ask anything\nof you other than to enjoy it and watch\nit.\nImperial is a Science and\nTechnology University, so we love\nour screens. What would you say to\nImperial students?\nI think all the Imperial students I\u2019ve\nmet are very well balanced. They\ninteract with technology at their\nwork and their study because it\u2019s a\nfundamental part of what they do. But\nmaybe the ones we\u2019ve spent time with\nare the ones who are interested in the\nissue and therefore more connected\nwith the outdoors? I\u2019d say, just\nwatch the \ufb01lm. If you come and see\nit \u2013 obviously it\u2019s playing at Imperial\n\u2013 what we\u2019ve found is that people\ndon\u2019t necessarily make some massive\nchange, but it\u2019s just the awareness of\nthe overwhelming scienti\ufb01c evidence\nthat\u2019s out there now to say how good\nit is for you to spend some time\nconnected to the outdoors. I mean,\nthe science is really compelling, it\u2019s\ngood for your blood pressure, your\nstress hormones, patients with a view\nof nature recover faster than patients\nwith an urban view, exam students\nwho study with a view of nature\nperform better in exams than those\nwho study without. There\u2019s a huge\nand growing body of peer-reviewed\nscienti\ufb01c evidence that you should\nget yourself a dose of nature, so I\u2019d\nsay to Imperial students, if you life\nhas become balanced away from that\nand into a very serene heavy existence,\ndon\u2019t stress about it, but at least \ufb01nd\nout about it, \ufb01nd out what you are\nmissing out on.\nI don\u2019t think screens are bad for you,\nbut they displace something that\u2019s\nreally, really good for you.\nYou are a film maker, so I can\u2019t resist\nasking, 35mm or digital?\nWe shot this on the C300, which is\ndigital. But I\u2019ve shot on \ufb01lm before\nand I love it. The trouble with \ufb01lm is\nthat when you press the record button\non the camera you can just hear the\nmoney burning. It\u2019s so expensive\nshooting on \ufb01lm, and the joy of digital\nis that you can do lots of takes. We\nshot 180 hours to make this 90 minute\ndocumentary. If you did that on \ufb01lm,\nyou\u2019d have to have a very, very, very big\nbudget. So I think, as a documentary\nmaker, my answer is digital.\nFinally, how did the frog taste?\nIt actually tastes pretty good. Once\nyou get over the texture it has quite a\nnice earthy, maybe even mushroomy\nkind of \ufb02avour. It wasn\u2019t bad... it was a\nlittle bit wet and cold, which is always\na bit of downer when you are licking\nsomething , but it was pretty good.\nWe hired it from an out\ufb01t called\nCelebrity Amphibians, and that frog\nhad been on Casualty.\nan Imperial Cinema near you...\nProject Wild Thing opens\nin Cinemas nationwide\non Friday 25th October.\nIt will be screening at\nImperial Cinema on\nFriday 25th October at\n5pm.

    "content": "12 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nKensington Palace \ufb01nally revealed last week that the\nmysterious VVIP guest who\u2019s attending the grand\nopening of the \u201cnew\u201d Centre for Blast Injury Studies\nis none other than my favourite eligible bachelor,\nPrince Harry. As part of the opening, they\u2019re holding\na Network Event, a day full of talks from scientists\nand soldiers alike. And the best part is, anyone can go.\nAnyone that is, except for me.\nI spent six months this year (ab)using the CBIS\nequipment, and as a favour to one of the postdocs\n\ufb01elding our red headed royal\u2019s visit, I spent the \ufb01rst few\ndays of my PhD avoiding any relevant work, and making\na poster of my old project, to be handily displayed in\nthe lab throughout the visit. I even resisted the urge to\nput my phone number on it (just in case, you know, he\nhas any questions). Hours of my time in the lab were\ndisrupted by hordes of people in suits coming and\ngoing, being briefed on the itinerary, and scribbling\nin their notebooks, without so much as an apologetic\nglance in my direction. Certainly an inconvenience, but\nanything for Harry!\nDespite my begging, I\u2019d been told \ufb01rmly that I\nwouldn\u2019t be able to cadge a spot in the lab during the\ndemonstrations, but I was very much looking forward\nto \ufb01nding any and every excuse to walk the halls of RSM\nand Bessemer while he just so happened to be around.\nI\u2019ve always had this \ufb01rmly held belief that if we were to\never meet, he would fall immediately in love with me,\nand that would be that: my happy ever after. I know that\nI\u2019m in South Ken. every day, and I could just frequent\nBoujis if I really wanted to meet him, but as far as I\nwas concerned, this was it. I was \ufb01nally (and literally)\ngoing to meet my prince. This Cressida wouldn\u2019t be a\nproblem. After all, who\u2019s he going to prefer: a socialite,\nor a scientist? And her last boyfriend was also called\nHarry - who does that?\nBut then I got an email. Suddenly I had to attend an\nall day meeting on the 17th! And as if they knew\nthat I would try to sneak out, just for a little bit, I\nwas scheduled to present at exactly the same time as\nmy beloved HRH\u2019s address. Despite all my e\ufb00orts, it\nbecame completely impossible for me to be on campus\nat all during the delightful Captain Wales\u2019s visit. A bit\ntoo convenient, I think.\nAnd this is why I think it\u2019s a conspiracy. See, I might\nhave mentioned my plan to someone who might have\nbeen a little bit in charge, and I may have inadvertently\ncome across as a bit \u201cfanatic\u201d or \u201cobsessive\u201d. That seems\nlike a subjective observation to me, and I certainly\nwasn\u2019t \u201csinister\u201d, but there we have it. Out of the blue,\nmy plans were scuppered, and I lost out on the chance\nto brush shoulders with His Highness.\nDoesn\u2019t that seem like a bit of a coincidence to you?\nMy Royal Conspiracy\nTessa Davey\nComment Editor\ny\nYou know you want it.\nYou\u2019re a good girl.\nT\nhese are lines taken from\nProject Unbreakable, where\nsurvivors of sexual assault\nare photographed holding\na poster with a quote from\ntheir attacker. These two lines come\nup again and again. They are also oft-repeated lyrics in Robin Thicke\u2019s song,\nBlurred Lines.\nI could tell you about the seven\nstudent unions across the country\n(from Edinburgh to Kingston), who\nhave decided that listening to the\n\u201clanguage of rapists\u201d is not appropriate\nfor their student unions. I could say\nthat we should do the same. I won\u2019t\nbecause there\u2019s little merit in banning\none song, when commercial music is\nfull of highly objectionable lyrics \u2013\nviolence against women, homophobia,\nracism.\nBanning one song (however bad) is\nnot the solution if those who want to\nplay it do not understand why others\ndo not want to hear it.\nWe need to ask our union bars, and\nthose using the Union to think about\nwhat they are playing. Do you want to\nbe the person responsible for playing a\nsong that makes a number of people in\nyour bar uncomfortable? Do you want\nto play a song with lyrics veering into\nsexual assault or homophobia?\nYou could argue that listening to\nsongswitho\ufb00ensivelyricsormeanings\nis not a problem in our student union\nsince we are all adults and can think\nfor ourselves and not be in\ufb02uenced\nby it, which for most of us, I am sure\nis the case. On the other hand, is that\nreally the point? If someone were to\nuse that kind of language to me in\nperson, I would justi\ufb01ably complain.\nIs it then okay for that same language\nto be playing for everyone to hear?\nYou could say that if I don\u2019t want to\nhear these songs, then I should just\nstay at home with a cup of tea. I do love\na good cup of tea, so this is tempting,\nbut the Union is not a central London\nbar running for pro\ufb01t. The Union is the\nhub of student activity at Imperial and\nhas to be a welcoming environment\nfor all students.\nYou could highlight that the intended meaning of songs like Blurred\nLines is more complex than just being\na bit \u201crapey\u201d. Robin Thicke has said\nthat his song is designed to challenge\nthe negative treatment of women by\nmaking fun of it. He has also said that\nit was a pleasure to degrade women in\nthe video, so you can believe whichever version you choose.\nWhatever the meaning of the song\n(intended or not), the language is\nstill problematic, and makes a large\nnumber of people uncomfortable. I\ndo not want to sit and listen to a song\ntelling me that when I say no, I might\nmean yes, while having a quiet drink\nin our student union.\nI don\u2019t want to listen to the language\nof rapists.\nI am not calling for a ban of the song\nin the Union, but I am asking you to\nthink about what you are listening\nto, and if you do like the song but not\nthe lyrics, perhaps you could always\nplay one of the parody versions, or\nan instrumental version instead. The\nproblem is much wider than Blurred\nLines. Be aware of what you are\nlistening to, particularly in a public\nplace.\nRobin Thicke: Trivialising Rape?\nKirstin Hay\nWriter\nTELEGRAPH\n\u201cBreak a motherfucker\u2019s\ntable over the back of a\ncouple faggots and crack\nit in half.\u201d \u2013 Eminem,\nRap God, 2013\n\u201cbanning\none song...\nis not the\nsolution\u201d\nLETTERS\nDear Felix Editor,\nI am writing to you, to inform of\nyou of a tremendous crime against\nhumanity.

    "content": "41\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 18 OCT\nCAREERS\nI\n\u2019m currently a Finance graduate\non the Unilever Future Leaders\nProgram (UFLP). At Imperial I\nstudied Physics (MSci) which\nisn\u2019t necessarily the most\nintuitive career \ufb01t. Not really having\nany \ufb01nancial background hasn\u2019t\nbeen a hindrance though, where the\nview is you can learn \ufb01nance, but\nyour attitude and way of approach\nis something you as an individual\nbring to the table. As I\u2019m sure a lot of\nstudentsatImperial\ufb01ndwhenitcomes\nto making your \ufb01rst career choice, it\u2019s\nincredibly tempting to go and work for\na big city bank or continue into further\nstudy. I personally wanted to work in\nan interesting sector that made a real\ntangible impact on peoples everyday\nlives. Not many companies can say\nover 2 billion people use one of their\nproducts on any given day. Unilever\ncould, and that\u2019s something I wanted\nto be a part of.\nMy \ufb01rst role on the UFLP is business\npartnering for Brand Building in Ice\nCream. I\u2019m going to say right now\nthat this is literally the most fun thing\nI\u2019ve ever done. I work with brand\nmanagers every day to make sure that\nUnilever\nRavi Pall\nImperial College\nPhysics MSci\n(2007-12)\ne\nthe decisions we make together have\nthe greatest impact they can, as if we\nwere spending our own money. When\nyou consider we own brands such as\nBen & Jerry\u2019s, Walls, Magnum etc you\nbegin to realise that the responsibility\nyou\u2019re given from day one e\ufb00ects how\nwell we do in such a competitive and\nlarge category. I cannot stress enough\nhow much this job is basically the\nwin-win scenario of corporate \ufb01nance\nwithout \u201cselling your soul.\u201d\nWhen applying for the job, like any\njob, it\u2019s important to highlight your\nstrengths as a rounded individual. It\u2019s\nhard to come across arrogant when\nyou simply talk through a experience\nor story which you know like the back\nof your hand. It\u2019s also important to\nrelate these narratives to the core\ncompetencies of the company you\u2019re\napplying for. Unilever has 5 and in\nevery answer to a question I thought\nabout not only how to answer the\ncompetency they\u2019re asking for, but\nthe other 4 as well. Many people are\nwell rounded, especially if you\u2019ve\nbeen active outside of academia, and\nit\u2019s just as important to demonstrate\nthis as it is to align with a company\u2019s\ncore competencies. As always it\u2019s\nalso a wise idea to read as much\nabout the company as possible. I\nhad Google alerts set up just on the\nword \u201cUnilever\u201d for example. What\u2019s\nalso important is how you highlight\nthat as a student from Imperial\n(predominantly STEM) you have\nstrong analytical reasoning and logical\napproach. In fact I\u2019d say that this is\nthe strongest thing my degree gave\nme, so be sure to draw from it.\nIn the future I look forward to\nworking in di\ufb00erent parts of the\norganisation, working on both a\nglobal and national level. There\u2019s\nalso potential to work abroad, which\nin itself bring a new challenge and\nbreadth of experience. I\u2019d highly\nrecommend applying now if you\u2019re\ninterested in working on something\ndi\ufb00erent yet career building.\nUnilever invest a lot in you (for\nexample paying for you to qualify in\nCIMA) and this in turn really helps\nplace you in a great position by the\nend of the scheme, where you\u2019re\nplaced in a management position.\nAlumnus Profile\n\n"

Over the\nlast 3/4/6 years you\u2019ve struggled and stressed over\ncoursework, problem sheet, labs, and exams and look at\nwhat you\u2019ve achieved! And while you\u2019ve spent your time\nstudying here you;ve also taken part in non-academic\nacivities and joined clubs and societies, which hopefully\nhelped to enrich your university experience.\nNow you\u2019re through the University gauntlet it\u2019s time to look ahead to\nthe future and look forward to what the future will bring. Some of you\nwill stay in your \ufb01eld of study, while others will take the skills they\u2019ve\ndeveloped and apply them to a new area of study or commerce, one of the\ngreat bene\ufb01ts an Imperial College London degree provides.\nAs you all spread out into the world, I for one hope that you can look back\non your years at Imperial with some warmth, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much easier to\nbe happy about it if you earn a generous salary! Even so, Imperial leaves\nit\u2019s mark on every graduate, akin to a blacksmith creating a new blade.\nAnd thus you become ambassadors of the Imperial brand as you progress\nthroughout your career.\nWe at Felix hope that you\u2019ve enjoyed reading the paper during the years\nyou\u2019ve studied here, and don\u2019t forget even though you\u2019ve graduated you\ncan still read Felix online, so if you ever have a burning itch to see the\nRector being pied, or want to see how Imperial has progressed since your\ndeparture I openly invite you to read each issue online.\nWe hope that we\u2019ve enriched your student experience while you\u2019ve been\nstudying at Imperial, from last year\u2019s coverage of #AgainstActon and\nthe potential closure of Garden Hall to the protest against Life Sciences\ncuts several years ago, as well as weekly content (including the ever so\ngentle Hangman and the facinating debates in the Comment section each\nweek). I think the centrefold might deserve a separate mention, a unique\nsection that brings greater exposure to di\ufb00erent student groups. If you\never get around to looking at this week\u2019s centrefold you\u2019ll be treated to\nthe rather unique sight of the longest surviving incarnation of the RCSU\nmascot (Theta the thermometer) being joyfully displayed by members of\nthe CGCU Executive committee.\nLooking around you on Commemoration day you\u2019ll see so many happy\nfaces of friends and stragers alike sharing excitment (and free drinks) with\ntheir families and course mates. Graduation is an exciting time and it\u2019s\nirreversible, after you\u2019ve graduated you can never go back, so make the\nmost of it while you can!\nThe Felix team and I would like to extend our congratulations to you one\nlast time and wish you all the best for the future. We\u2019re sure you\u2019ll have\nsome great triumphs in the years ahead, even if you might have to hand\nyour gown back after at the end of Commemoration day.\nBest of luck for the years ahead!\nFelix\n\n"

Tor is a piece\nof software, ironically funded by the\nUS government, which enables the\nanonymity of its users sur\ufb01ng the\nweb, posting on forums and general\ninternet communication; a great way\nto aid journalists or even the average\nperson in countries that prohibit\ncertain sites and topics of discussion.\nThe methods the NSA has indulged\nitself in, in order to circumvent a\nvariety of NET encryptions, are\narguably controversial. Hacking\ninto private companies in order\nto steal their server\u2019s encryptions\nis one example. Another as stated\nby the New York Times involves\ncollaborating with tech companies\nto build in backdoors in computing\nsystems and covertly introducing\nweaknesses in encryption standards.\nGet rich quick, Youtube style!\nLayer by layer, the controversy surrounding the NSA increases!\nAll of you spend a signi\ufb01cant amount\nof your life on YouTube, be it watching\nhandy tutorial videos, lets-plays,\nmusic videos and/or videos of cute-ass kittens (the last being the most\ntime intensive). However have you\never wondered why some of these\nYoutubers, more often than not just\naverage Joe\u2019s, actually do it? Yes of\ncourse they are all kind, considerate\npeople who really just want to\nentertain you, but apart from that\nhave you ever thought, what\u2019s in it for\nthem? Cash. Cold, hard cash. YouTube\nmakes money from ads, and so that\nthey encourage more clicks/views,\nthey need to share some of the loot.\nNow I know exactly what you are\nthinking. You are sitting there reading\nthis, munching on your sandwhich/\nhomemade pasta, wanting some of\nthat glorious dough. Well in fact that\nis not hard as long as you follow this\nabsolutely patented fail safe acme\ncashtube plan!\nFirstly, make yourself an account.\nWithout an account you will not be\nable to upload any videos, get on to\nthat. Now think of a creative name\nthat will stick in peoples minds as\nwell as perhaps describing what\nyou do. Therefore don\u2019t call yourself\nRamalama-dingdong unless you plan\nto talk about bells or report on the\nDalai Lama.\nNext you will need to come up with\noriginal content. Trust me the people\nwho repost other peoples content\nwill never get to the upper echelons\nof youtube aristocracy. Think of\nsomething that no one has done\nbefore. It can be funny (usually the\nbest), serious or something\ntotally weird. It doesn\u2019t really matter,\nas long as its new and you are good\nat it! However if you do not have any\nideas, usually putting up videos of\nyour kittens or puppies doing cute\nstu\ufb00 is a good start. If you do not own\nany pet, you can always try remixing\nnyan cat!\nOnce you have a certain amount of\nsubscribers (500) is a good number,\nand are churning out good content\non a weekly basis, you should start\nthinking about becoming a youtube\npartner. With this program the money\ncan start rolling in. Depending on your\npopularity and/or viewing numbers\n(which are usually very closely related)\nit. The NSA justi\ufb01ed its actions by\nclaiming that it only targets criminals\nsuch as terrorists and human\ntra\ufb03ckers. It is without a doubt that\ncertain shady individuals may use\nTor or other such online utilities, but\nclaiming that the NSA \u2018\u2026.collects\nonly those communications that it\nis authorized by law to collect for\nvalid foreign intelligence,\u2019 as they\nsaid in a statement to the Guardian,\nhas been proven to be untrue.\nIt\u2019s common knowledge now that\nthe NSA spies on individuals and\norganizations that have nothing to do\nwith crime. Take Brazilian Oil Giant\nPetrobras as an example; they\u2019ve\nyou can get anywhere between $2.5 to\n$7 per 1,000 views. While this does\nnot sound like much, it can certainly\nadd up.\nSo wow, now you are a up and\ncoming youtube celebrity. The cash\nain\u2019t the only bene\ufb01t that will come\nyour way. If you are a gamer, you may\nget free games etc., if you do comedy,\nyou may get o\ufb00ered a movie role (niga\nhiga) or if you sing....oh wait, thats\nJustin Bieber. Actually please don\u2019t\nsing.\nHowever on a serious note, more\nthan being interested in making\nThis all may seem like a far-fetched\nconspiracy theory but as more and\nmore revelations on the NSA\u2019s privacy\nbreaching activities comes to surface,\nit seems they would do anything to\nget their hands on sensitive material.\nTor, formally known as \u2018The Onion\nRouter\u2019, works by layering signals\nsent online with encryption, these\n\u2018coated\u2019 signals are then sent through\na random path through a network\nof routers which in turn, each peel\no\ufb00 a layer of encryption until the\nsignal has reached its destination.\nThis method prevents any one of the\nrouters from having access to all the\nencryptions at once hence the signal\ncan\u2019t be tracked back to its original\nsender. Unfortunately for the NSA\nthis method of \u2018anonymisation\u2019 has\nfoxed their hackers as they stated\nthemselves through documents\nleaked by Edward Snowden, \u2018\u2026deanonymize a very small fraction of\nusers.\u2019 In a way this is great for a Tor\ndeveloper, personally if I was one of\nthem I\u2019d have a big grin on my face.\nWhen it comes to tackling Tor, the\nNSA has no reservations, from\nutilizing \ufb02aws in one of the Mozilla\nFirefox versions to directing user\ntra\ufb03c to their NSA operated servers\nin order to degrade the service to\nreduce the number of people using\nThe News Bubble\nMaximilian Eggl\nYong Wen Chua\nOsama Awara\nTechnology Editors\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to\ndatewith thenewest,wierdestandmostfuturisticthingsaround\nMaybe color ain\u02bct so good after all\nSnaphack, saving one pic at a time\nIf you are a fan of the photo messaging app you should be slightly\nconcerned. The advantage of using snapchat is that your innocent photos\nand videos (or maybe not so innocent ;-)) are deleted within a set time\nafter being viewed. However with the release of Snaphack this deletion\nprocess can be stopped without the knowledge of the sender. This app,\ncurrently available in the apple App store.

The\ngame starts o\ufb00 with a\nmontage of you (as Jason\nBrody), your brothers and your\nfriends having the time of their\nlife on a large island in the south\npaci\ufb01c. The nightmare quickly\nbegins when Jason wakes up to \ufb01nd\nhimself imprisoned in a bamboo\ncage by indigenous pirates, and it\u2019s\nnot long before you meet the \ufb01end\nhimself, the psycho pirate lord Vaas.\nYou are now tasked with missions\nin service of the Rakyat leading to\nrescuing your friends, taking over\nthe Island, and assassinating Vaas.\nThere is a lot of fun in watching\nJason progress through the game\nas he self-teaches himself ways to\nsurvive through the jungle including\nhis extraordinary methods of healing\nhimself! A shot to the arm while\ndriving will prompt Brody to \u2018bite\nthe bullet\u2019 as he clenches the bullet\nout of his \ufb02esh with his teeth and\nspit it out all with one hand on the\nwheel. There are plenty of other\nre\ufb02exes and scenes spread through\nthe game that give the player a\nfeeling that they are adapting better\ninto the environment with Brody.\nThe overall plot of Far Cry 3 is\nengaging and the characterisation\nand development of the cast are\nimpressive. Vaas\u2019 famous question\non insanity rings in the players ears\nwhen we start to see suspicious\nand creepy stu\ufb00 around the Island.\nInsanity permeates through this\nIsland. Those who learn to embrace\nand adapt to the Island turn more\nvicious, tribal, angry, dehumanised\nand animalistic. We follow the once\nscared twenty-something frightened,\nJason Brody turn into a ruthless\nskilled killer. It is a theme that\nculminates to an epic conclusion\nwhere the player is granted a choice\nthat decides the ending of the game.\nFar Cry 3 really beautifully couples\nthe story parts of the game with the\nnon-story parts. Here\u2019s why: When\nyou are roaming the Island, you can\nhunt di\ufb00erent animals, forage rare\nplants that you can use to upgrade\nyourpouchesandweaponsrucksacks,\nhealth potions and other recipes.\nYou can also hijack radio towers to\nuncover more places in the map,\ntake control of pirate coves, trials\nof the Rakyat. The skills, equipment\nand knowledge of the island you\ngain from these extra missions\nundergird the story line missions\nwhich become increasingly di\ufb03cult.\nUnfortunately, the weapons and\ncollectibles inventory was di\ufb03cult\nto use and this did take a toll on the\ngameplay as the game progressed\ninto more challenging zones -perhaps most annoying was my\nmini-expedition to hunt dangerous\nand rare animals for special leather\nfor a promised upgraded pouch\nto store four weapons but I could\nstill only hold a maximum of two.\nThe accessibility and simplicity\nof the rucksack inventory is\nde\ufb01nitely a room for improvement\nfor the rumoured sequel to this\ngame set to come out in 2014.\nJason has a good range of weapons\nat his disposal that he can purchase\nat a Rakyat shop or he can unlock\nfor free by claiming radio towers.\nThere is a huge scope to be clever\nand creative with how you use\nweapons to conquer pirate coves\nor complete missions in general.\nTake your short-range \ufb02amethrower\nto set nearby enemies on \ufb01re or be\nmore strategic and beset pirates\nby setting a whole cove on \ufb01re. The\nsniper ri\ufb02e is man\u2019s best friend in\nthis game; it really makes me feel\nin control when Jason can take out\npirates one by one at a distance.\nThere are plenty of other good\nweapons to purchase and unlock too.\nVehicles can be used in and outside\nof missions from buggies to cargo\ntrucks to jet skis to handgliders\n(pretty fun). Your vehicles can take\ndamage from enemy attacks and\nbashing into trees and falling of\nmountain sides - a fun experience.\nVehicle control is not too demanding\nto frustrate the game play and not\ntoo simple to use to break away\nfrom the realism of the game.\nThe music and sound e\ufb00ects\ndeserve merit too. The realistic\nand frightening sound tracks truly\ncapture the suspense of the moment\nand I still \ufb01nd myself listening to\nsome of the legendary soundtracks\no\ufb00 YouTube. All this combined\nwith stunning graphics will\ncaptivate you for hours of pure joy.\nFar Cry 3 was released in November\n2012. It can currently be bought\nfor around \u00a316.99 on PS3, \u00a317.99\non XBOX 360, and \u00a312.99 on PC.\nT\nhere are few new games that\nhold my attention for very\nlong anymore. I\u2019m bored of\ngames like Assassins Creed\nand Halo with their endless\nsequels that seem to o\ufb00er nothing\nnew except better graphics (even\nthough I still buy them). However\nthere is something about Nintendo\nthat makes me forgive them for\ndoing just that. Every new Mario,\nZelda and Donkey Kong game that\ncomes out always get me excited,\nand Windwaker HD is no exception.\nAs a massive fan of the original\nGamecube version I was pretty sure\nI would like this one too, but I didn\u2019t\nexpect to like it as much as I do.\nWindwaker, for those who didn\u2019t\nplay the original, is a game in the\nLegend of Zelda series. You play\nas Link, the hero of time, and must\ncomplete dungeons and solve\nproblems in order to rescue princess\nZelda. Windwaker is the only game\n(discounting the DS ones) that uses\na cartoon art style, which looks\nbeautiful remastered in HD. Although\nthe game looks di\ufb00erent it is still the\ngame many of you will remember\nand will provide many moments of\nnostalgia. Everything that originally\nmade this game mothertrucking\namazing is still here. There is so much\nthat this game does well; the plot is\nengaging and often full of humour, the\nworld is open and big and apart from\na short \u201ctutorial\u201d at the beginning is\nopen for you to explore right from\nthe start. All the items you get in this\ngame are used again and again and\ndon\u2019t feel like gimmicks, with the best\nobviously being the Deku Leaf! The\ncombat system is arguably the best of\nany Zelda game and your character\nalways responds how you would like.\nThe Wii U version does add more\nthan HD graphics. Link controls\neven better than before on the\ngamepad or pro controller. Pausing\nthe game to look at maps or switch\nitems has been made unnecessary\nas you can do all that seamlessly on\nthe gamepad screen in the middle\nof a \ufb01ght, or sailing on your boat.\nSailing around is even more of a joy\nwith the addition of a fast sail that\nenables you to sail faster, and always\nhave the wind behind you. Fans of\nthe original may be glad to hear that\nthe Triforce collecting at the end\nhas been shortened, causing less\nfrustrating encounters with Tingle\n(the Jar Jar Binks of Zelda). For the\ncompletionests out there, the game\no\ufb00ers a gallery where you can turn\nphotos into \ufb01gurines. When I was\nyoung, playing the original, my goal\nin life was the complete this gallery,\nbut it was frustrating as many of\nthe pictures are missable causing\na complete gallery to take many\nplaythroughs (there is a second quest\nafter you \ufb01nish the game). However,\nthe remake, as well as o\ufb00ering an\nexpanded memory to your camera\n(12 pictures), has Tingle Bottles:\nbottles you can throw in the sea with\nmessages and pictures. As well as\nbeing a nice and often funny addition\nto the game, it now means you can\nget the pictures from other people\nmaking the Nintendo Gallery a more\nachievable and enjoyable experience.\nI may achieve my lifelong goals at last!\nDespite being amazing in nearly\nevery way I do have some very minor\ncomplaints. You can now move while\naiming items, which can be great in\ncertain situations but often it can be\nawkward. Try aiming and shooting an\nitem while moving and the item is not\nbound to a trigger for example. Also\nthe game is too easy. I completed my\n\ufb01rst playthough (around 18 hours)\nwithout dying a single time, and I even\nhad my fairy I collected just before\nthe \ufb01rst boss still in its bottle. These\nproblems however are so minor and\nyou could argue aren\u2019t problems. The\naiming can be made good by binding\naimable items to a trigger, and I\nactually found it extremely useful to\nmove and aim at times. There is also\na Hero Mode which makes the game\nharder and I will de\ufb01nitely be using\nthis during my second playthough.\nOverall I believe Windwaker HD\nis still the amazing game it was and\nthis version just improves it to near\nperfection. It is de\ufb01nitely my most\nplayed Wii U game already in just\na week, and I see myself putting\nmany more hours into it before I\nget tired. There\u2019s just so much to do.\nFar Cry 3: Pirate Infested Tropical Dystopia\nWindwaker turns over a new Deku Leaf\nCalum Skene\nGames Editor\nThe Windwaker HD is a welcome addition to the Wii U\nLink realises he\u02bcs been here before in a previous life.\n\u201cDid I ever tell you the definition of insanity?\u201d \u2013 Vaas\n\n"

What\nHarold and his ex-CIA buddy John\nReese (Jim \u201cJesus Christ\u201d Caviezel)\nreceive every week is a social security number...and when the writers\nare feeling extra bold and ambitious,\nmore than one...and with no idea\nwhether this \u201cperson of interest\u201d is\nthe victim or perpetrator, it\u2019s up to\nFinch and Reese to track the person\ndown and solve the mystery. The\nmachine is never wrong, and not\nevery case turns out to be as simple\nas it seems in the beginning, which is\nwhy each stand-alone episode takes\nup 40+ minutes to come to a close.\nPutting a nice, original twist to the\nwell-worn genre, Person of Interest\nwas off to a flying start on the CBS\nnetwork up against the long-running\nABC\u2019s sappy medical drama Grey\u2019s\nAnatomy. Throughout season 1\nthere were plenty of hints and teasing alluding to the characters\u2019 origins\nstory: both Finch and Reese had fascinating stories to tell, and season 2\ngave the writers a chance to expand\non this more.\nWith Finch, his relationship with\nan equally brilliant colleague of his,\nNathan Ingram (Brett Cullen), who\nis now dead, and the many unanswered questions regarding the\ncreation of the machine are fully ad-dressed, with intermittent flashback\nsequences embedded within appropriate episodes to shine some light\non the complicated past. Government secrecy and conspiracy, as well\nas the powerful people who fear for\nthe legality issues that arise with this\nall-knowing machine all contribute\nto create a fascinating season-long\nstory arc that puts both Finch and\nReese in danger. Carrie Preston,\nan underused and under-awarded\nactress who constantly features in\nsmall supporting guest roles, who\nalso happens to be Emerson\u2019s real-life wife, features as Finch\u2019s rather\nsweet love-interest, the development\nof which serves as a nice distraction\nfrom the otherwise more serious\ncrime drama.\nReese and his darker, morally ambiguous days are further explored\nhere, more specifically relating to the\ntwo ladies who had quite the impact\non his life; Agent Kara Stanton (An-nie Parisse) and Jessica Arndt (Susan\nMisner). Softly-spoken yet intense in\nall the right moments with dry, sarcastic humour thrown into the mix,\nCaviezel is perfectly suited for the\nrole of a skilled agent back in action.\nMore help is available to them\nwithin the NYPD who now know a\nthing or two about how these two\nmen go about their crime-solving\nbusiness. Detectives Joss Carter\n(Taraji P. Henson) and Lionel Fusco\n(Kevin Chapman) are both valuable\nadditions to the cast providing solid\nsupport in terms of back-up during\naction sequences as well as when\nit comes to information-gathering.\nThere is playful banter between all\nfour in the group, although it\u2019s the\ngrowing bromance between the lead\npair that is the most entertaining.\nThe initially mismatched duo of a\nsocially awkward billionaire comput-er-nerd with an ex-military, ex-CIA\nagent is a pairing that gets off to an\nentertainingly rocky start in season 1\nbutnowtheyoperatelikeawell-oiled\nmachine, having excellent dynamic\nand chemistry that evolve as each\nseason moves forward.\nRecurring guest stars make welcome returns: starting from Zoe\nMorgan (the excellent Paige Turcoit\u2019s always a pleasure to see her back),\na helpful, resourceful ally who has\nmany rich and famous friends, Carl\nElias (Enrico Colantoni) a crime boss\nwith useful knowledge on many of\nNew York\u2019s underground operations\nwho is currently in jail, amongst\nothers.\nThe complexity and intriguing\npremise related to every weekly case\nis variable with some hitting the\nspot, whilst a couple seem a little too\nrushed and serve as merely filling in\nanother weekly slot in their 22-epi-sode season. But with its second series Person of Interest has certainly\ngained confidence in its footing\nand with a helpful introduction of a\nsnarky, psychotic villainess (the wonderful Amy Acker), the climax does\nstart building until a satisfying finale\nthat sets things up nicely for season 3\nwhich is well underway in the States.\n\n"

    "content": "32 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBFI London Film Festival\nIn the opening scenes of Borgman,\nthe latest film by Dutch director Alex\nvan Warmerdam, a priest and his two\naccomplices hunt down a mysterious\nbearded man living in a subterranean hideaway; after they crash down\nthrough his ceiling, the forest-dweller\nonly just escapes, throwing gas canisters behind him, emerging through a\ntrapdoor, and running away through\nthe trees clutching a briefcase. The\nfilm just gets stranger from hereon in.\nBorgman is a surreal, darkly humorous home-invasion style film, in\nwhich the titular character, after es-Fred Fyles\nWriter\nBorgman\nDirector: Alex van Warmerdam\nWriter: Alex van Warmerdam\nStarring: Jan Bijvoet, Hadewych\nMinis, Jeroen Perceval\nRuntime: 113 minutes\ncaping the priest, insidiously inserts\nhimself into an upper-middle class\nhousehold. Playing with themes of\npower and powerlessness, Borgman\nmanages to be both the victim and\nthe controller, being savagely beaten\nby the householder in one scene, and\nhaving dinner served to him whilst\nin a bathtub in the next. Cutting a\nCharles Manson-esque figure, Borgman, played by Jan Bijvoet, manages\nto gain the sympathies of Marina, the\nartist wife of a TV executive, who lives\nin a luxurious modernist villa with her\nthree children and their nanny; seemingly imbued with shamanistic powers he - along with a gang of equally\nodd accomplices - manages to turn the\nhousehold against each other, creating\nan atmosphere of tension and fear.\nOf course, when talking about home\ninvasion it is near impossible not to\nthink of Michael Haneke\u2019s 1997 work\nFunny Games, and Borgman shares\nthis film\u2019s lashings of black humour;\nhowever, van Warmerdam also seems\nindebted to Haneke\u2019s 2005 film Cach\u00e9, and both films explore how the\nsecurity of the middle-classes can be\nundermined by a single outsider. Unfortunately Borgman, despite much\npromise at the beginning of the film,\ndoesn\u2019t manage to reach the dizzying heights of Haneke\u2019s work. The\ntension never quite reaches breaking\npoint; the humours elements of the\nfilm, while amusing, don\u2019t quite feel\nbleak or sardonic enough to count as\ngallows humour; and while the ma-lignant, underlying darkness that lies\nat the centre of many seemingly-cosy\nfamilies is an interesting theme to ex-plore, van Warmerdam showcases this\nidea with very little subtlety or nuance\n- in one scene the husband tells his\nchildren \u2018we shouldn\u2019t have to apologise for being better off than others\u2019.\nThese shortcomings make the film\nultimately disappointing, and mean\nthat the sense of menace that pervades the film throughout the first\nhalf doesn\u2019t continue into the finale,\nmaking it seem bloated and dragging.\nBorgman is visually brilliant, and appears to be utterly realistic in capturing the trappings of the bourgeoisie,\nbut a failure to maintain pacing means\nthat it feels a bit like an amuse-bouche\nstretched out into a full three-course\nmeal.\nComputer Chess\nDirector: Andrew Bujalski\nWriter: Andrew Bujalski\nStarring: Patrick Riester, Wiley\nWiggins, Myles Paige, Robin\nSchwartz\nRuntime: 92 minutes\nAndrewBujalski\u2019sfilmComputerChess\nis a humorous, experimental look at\nthe early days of chess programming.\nFirst screened at Sundance, where it\nwon an acclaim and accolades, it then\nbounced around festivals, and finally\nit has touched down on these shores\nwith a reputation that precedes it. It\nis therefore perhaps no surprise that I\nfind myself, despite the fact that it is a\ngloomy Friday afternoon, in a sold out\nauditorium, filled with people excited\nto see this strange little film.\nWhile the concept of the plot - programmers in the early 80s coming\ntogether in a hotel to pit computers\nagainst each other in games of chess\n- may not sound like the most enthralling of films, Bujalski\u2019s frequent\ntangents give this film an incredibly\nexperimental edge. The most striking\nthing about the film is how authentic\nit is; Bujalski filmed the entire thing\non video recorders made in the 1970\u2019s,\nand the majority of the computers used\nin the film are authentic artifacts from\nthe time period. Non-professional ac-tors, who make up around 90% of the\ncast, remain uncompromisingly awkward on film; every \u2018umm\u2019 and \u2018ahh\u2019 is\naccentuated, creating an atmosphere\nof nerdish anxiety. In fact, the realism\nis so convincing that producer Alex\nLipschultz has stated that most people believe it to be a documentary for\nthe first 15 minutes - something I can\ncompletely understand.\nIt would be easy to describe the\nfilm as a mockumentary, but that\ndescription would be too simplistic,\nas it doesn\u2019t take long for the film to\nexplore bizarre tangents, essentially\nmaking Computer Chess seem like a\nseries of miniature shorts, strung together by circumstance. We have Michael Papageorge, a surly, confrontational programmer whose hotel room\nhas been booked out to someone else;\nwe follow his surreal nocturnal wanderings trying to find a room, roaming\nthe corridors and knocking on everyone\u2019s doors; when he finally does get\na room he finds that it is inhabited by\ncats. And then we have the coming-of-age tale of Patrick Reister, a cripplingly\nawkward young programmer for the\nCal-Tech team, whose failure to comprehend social interactions is tested\nwhen he runs into a couple who are at\nthe hotel for a \u2018self-help\u2019 retreat, and\nis invited into a menage-a-trois with\nthem. It is stories like these that mark\nComputer Chess apart from other\nfilms; while Bujalski could have easily\nused the ready-made narrative of the\nchess tournament to drive the film, he\nseems to have resist this temptation,\ninstead creating a winding, non-linear\nfilm that delights and astounds.\nA film that consists of a mainly nonprofessional cast, that was mainly\nimprovised (Bujalski only wrote 8\npages of script), and spans such a wide\nrange of genres - from documentary\nto comedy, arthouse to sci-fi - could\neasily descend into a complete mess,\ncrushed under the weight of its own\nambition, but Computer Chess doesn\u2019t\nhave this problem. The multitude of\nplotlines have been edited down into\na streamlined 90 minutes, creating\na product that is well-paced, snappy,\nand incredibly amusing.\nIt is fascinating, in a world that\nseems in thrall to the fetishisation of\nanalogue technology, to have a film\nthat explores a world that has been\nforever lost. Bujalski has called the\nprogrammers who inspired the work\n\u2018a different breed...who saw this mountain and insisted on climbing it\u2019; while\ntoday the world of technology revolves around Apple and Silicon Valley, the origins of computer programming could not be further removed\nfrom this idea of \u2018geek-chic\u2019. Bujalski\nreminds us that the vanguards of the\nprogramming movement were - much\nlike this film - odd, awkward, endear-ing, and utterly brilliant.\nIn some ways, film festivals like the one\ncurrently being held in London, are a\ngodsend to films like Miele; where\nelse, other than the festival circuit, will\nwe be able to watch a French-Italian\nfilm, made on a miniature budget, that\ntells the story of a young woman who\nassists in the suicide of terminally ill\npatients? And yet, despite a description that makes it sound like any number of European arthouse films, Miele\nmanages to retain a sense of warmth\nand pathos, thanks to confident performances on and off the screen.\nThe first directorial effort from veteran Italian actress Valeria Golino,\nMiele revolves around the double life\nof 20-something year old Irene (Jas-mine Trinca), a young woman with\nan active social life, who swims every\nmorning and has athletic sex with\nher lover. But every week she takes a\nplane into LA, where she then travels to Mexico in order to buy banned\nbarbiturates; after taking them back\nto Italy, she becomes \u2018Miele\u2019, and uses\nthem to help terminally ill people end\ntheir lives. An angel of death, dressed\nin skinny jeans and with a multitude\nof piercings, Irene/Miele resembles a\nsort of Italian Lisbeth Salander. Slightly distant to those around her, and\nharbouring dark secrets, Irene carries on living this double life, until she\nmeets Carlo Grimaldi (Carlo Cecchi),\nan aging engineer who asks for help\nin ending his life. When she finds out\nhe is not terminally ill, her carefully\nordered world comes crashing down\naround her.\nMiele\nDirector: Valeria Golino\nWriters: Valeria Golino, Francesca\nMarciano, Valia Santella\nStarring: Jasmine Trinca, Carlo\nCecchi, Libero de Rienzo, Vinicio\nMarchioni, Iaia Forte\nRuntime: 100 minutes\nMiele exists in the grey areas of mo-rality, and makes a show of breaking\ndown the walls of absolute morality;\nIrene is upset that Carlo is not ill, because that means she has broken one\nof the multitude of \u2018rules\u2019 she must\nfollow when doing her job: she must\nnot use the word \u2018wish\u2019, she must stay\nuntil the end, she cannot use any future tense verbs. Irene\u2019s views on the\ntopic of euthanasia are clear cut, but\nas she gets to know Carlo, she begins\nto question what she is doing.\nWhile such a topic is controversial,\nnot least of all in Italy, the film manages to avoid becoming a polemic,\nsubtly navigating the issues surrounding euthanasia. However, in doing so\nthey rob the film of some of its energy,\nmeaning that - after a promising start\n- the plot stagnates in the middle. Furthermore, Golino has a habit of avoiding the heart of the action; whenever\nIrene \u2018helps\u2019 a patient, we never actually see the patient dying. We never\nsee the aftermath. Instead, the cam-era, almost without exception, will follow Irene, and music will fade in over\nthe sound of crying. While such action may seem logical, if we compare\nit to Haneke\u2019s Amour, another film\nthat revolves around assisted suicide\n(and does so in a much more visceral\nand horrifying manner), Miele seems\nquite laconic, almost trite. This is a\ndifficult topic we are dealing with, and\nby directing it in such a way Golino\ndoes not show us the full picture.\nThat being said, the film does pick\nup again towards the end, and is driven along by Trinca\u2019s stunning turn in\nthe role of Irene/Miele. Beginning as\ncold and aloof, the character slowly\nopens up to the viewer. We discover\nwhy she chose the career she did, and\nhow - despite her tough, tomboyish\nexterior - inside she is just as scared\nand alone as those she helps kill. This\nskill in front of the camera, combined\nwith Golino\u2019s developing skill behind\nit, make Miele a film to see - if it ever\nbreaks out of the festival circuit.\n\n"

It felt\nmore like a series of lectures rather\nthan a cohesive piece of storytelling.\nThe scatterings of humour throughout\nhowever did have the audience\nlaughing and kept it light-hearted and\nfun.\nMarcus du Sautoy\u2019s acting\nnevertheless was powerful and very\nconvincing, troubled and confused\nby the sudden realization that all he\nknows may not be true. It truly was a\ngreat performance from him. Victoria\nGould showed some opening night\nnerves, occasionally forgetting her\nlines, but also did well. The problem\nhere was not the acting but rather the\nconstruction of the dialogue.\nIf your maths knowledge is limited\nthen perhaps this could serve as an\nstimulating night out to test your mind\n\u2013 but it came across a bit patronising\nto an audience of mostly adults. The\nconcepts were interesting but they\nneeded to be woven together better,\nand overall it was disappointing.\nIt would work perfectly for a teacher\nto take their class to on school trip and\nhave their minds blown by some cool\nmaths tricks, getting them interested\nand talking about maths and science\nin the process.

When\none of its most recent sales came\nup on \u201cTravel, Science and Natural\nHistory\u201d, it seemed to be too good an\nopportunity to miss.\nChristie\u2019s was founded by James\nChristie in the late 18th century, and\nhas grown into a household name\nacross the world. However, they are\nnot what you would expect from\nmany hours of watching daytime\nTV such as Treasure Hunt (yes, I\nknow, but I couldn\u2019t be bothered to\nchange the channel). Everything is\nconducted with precision and a hint\nof ruthlessness.\nI simply love their catalogue, which\nis beautifully printed in a glossy\nmagazine which can be picked up by\nthe counter in the foyer, continuous\nwith the main auction area. On one\nside it is lined by high tables where\nChristie\u2019s trained telephone sta\ufb00\nsit, whilst the other side had framed\npaintings hung at eye level for you\nto peruse at leisure, of which many\nwould be sold during the day.\nI was tempted to register for a\npaddle (the numbered plate you make\na bid with), but seeing a 28cm wide\nmeteorite go for an astounding \u00a33500,\nI decided window-shopping is not\nsuch a bad idea!\nFive minutes into the bidding, I\nwas already ba\ufb04ed. The auctioneer\nfrequently addressed the online\nbidders, somehow knowing exactly\nwhere they were from (\u201c\u00a33000 from\nonline bid in Japan\u201d) whilst taking their\nbid to the telephone bidders and those\nin the room. He spoke at lightening\npace and \ufb01red questions at those in\nthe room as well as the sta\ufb00 who were\non with bidders over the phone, whilst\nsimultaneously acknowledging the\npresence of these online bidders. I\nwas perplexed. Where was he getting\nthe information from? Unless they\nwere speaking in tongues, I hadn\u2019t the\nfoggiest idea.\nThe sta\ufb00 at Christie\u2019s kindly pointed\nit out to me: there is a small screen\nfacing the auctioneer with online bids\nfrom buyers across the globe who has\nregistered prior to the auction online,\ndisplaying their country of origin and\nbidding amount as the auction was\nbeing streamed live on their website.\nIf you happen to have saved money\nsince the start of term, you might have\nbeen interested in a 1719 early Italian\nbinocular telescope, a bohemian\ntellurian, or even an early English\nterrestrial globe. The problem is in\norder to see the actual collections, you\nhave to come before the auction day\nto the galleries at the back of the o\ufb03ce\nwhere they are displayed. I happened\nto see the Japan-themed collection\nand they have some amazing stu\ufb00!\nTo the scientists amongst you (yes,\nyou), the name Ivan Petrovich Pavlov\nwill not be unfamiliar to you. I was\nmesmerised, with bated breath, as the\nbidding started for the \ufb01rst edition\nmanuscript of Pavlov\u2019s celebrated\nlectures on physiology of digestion,\nfor which he won the Nobel Prize\nin 1904. With just a \ufb02ick of a wrist,\na click of a mouse, the buyers faced\nsti\ufb00 competition from all sides as they\nclamoured to obtain ownership of this\nrare collection. With each exchange,\nthe price increased: \u00a32500, \u00a33000,\n\u00a33500.... And with a \ufb01nal shake of\nthe head in the room, the manuscript\nwent for a whopping \u00a37000, more than\ntriple the estimate!\nYou could feel the tension in the\nair when bidding started, and watch\nopen-mouthed as people battled to\nget what they wanted. The added\nbonus of seeing the collections before\nthey are sold o\ufb00 to private collectors\nwas worth the time, and if you happen\nto be around the area, go to Christie\u2019s\nand step into another world. You\nnever know what you will \ufb01nd in the\ntreasure trove.\nChristie\u2019s South Kensington is located\non 85 Old Brompton Rd, SW7 3LD.\nAuctions are free to attend, with no\nneed to register.\nGETTY IMAGES\n\u201c\u00a33000 from Japan! \u00a34000 from Moscow! \u00a35000 from the little old\nman in the front!\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "30 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Old Men and the Sea\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nCaptain Phillips\nDirector: Paul Greengrass\nWriters: Billy Ray, Richard Phillips\n(novel), Stephan Talty (novel)\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi,\nCatherine Keener\nRuntime: 134 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nLeave it to Paul Greengrass, the man\nbehind United 93, to direct another\ntaut, claustrophobic thriller, but this\ntime set on the choppy sea waters\ninstead of inside a plane. Based on\nthe real-life Captain Richard Phillips\n(Tom Hanks) whose cargo ship was\nboarded by Somali pirates wielding\nmachine guns, Captain Phillips, is a\nsurvival drama in which Phillips needs\nto muster up the courage, strength\nand intelligence required to make it\nthrough this tough ordeal. Suddenly\nthrust into the role of having to protect his crew as well as look out for\nhis own life, this ordinary family man\nwith no particular skills when it comes\nto dealing with terrorists faces the\nmost challenging task of his life.\nShot in authentic locations (the\nships, the ocean, the whole lot), the\nfilm\u2019s heightened realism is what gives\nthis the extra kick, as once the pirates\nstart chasing their target with no sign\nof slowing down despite the unkind\nwaves, it certainly marks one of the\nbest things Greengrass has done in\nhis already admirable directorial ca-reer. The shoddily defended cargo\nship does what it can to protect itself\nand repel outside invaders, under the\ncalm, level-headed command of the\nCaptain (he even proves to be an excellent shot, attempting to derail their\nplan by firing flare-guns), but after an\nextended scene of unbearable tension\nthat sees the pirates play around with\ntheir access ladder, they eventually\nboard, which is where the stand-off\nbegins.\nKeeping his cool and trying to come\nup with a plan is Captain Phillips, using his ship knowledge to cleverly navigate his way around the pirates with\nhis words. None of the crew on board\nare trained in fighting, most certainly\nnot against heavily armed Somalis\nwho will stop at nothing to grab as\nmuch as they can. The strategy for the\ncrew is to remain hidden at all cost, as\nPhillips doesn\u2019t want a hostage situa-tion. There are many tense moments\nwhere the cast plays the most deadly\nversion of hide-and-seek, one that\nescalates to something of a far higher\nstake that won\u2019t be spoiled here.\nWhat\u2019s intelligent about Greengrass\u2019\napproach to what may have been a\nsimple, straightforward idea is that his\n\u201cvillains\u201d are never as black and white\nas you would initially have expected\nthem to be. The pirates live in a village\nwhere residents are constantly pushed\nand harassed to hijack profitable ships\nto pass on to their elders and leaders.\nIt\u2019s evident that this is the only kind of\nlife they have ever known, and it\u2019s refreshing to see a portrayal of the non-American antagonist in a blockbuster\nproduction to be given much more\ndepth and screen-time than what is\ntypically shown.\nThe cast of the Somali pirates, all of\nthem non-professional actors in their\nmotion picture debuts, are simply\nstunning. Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the\none spear-heading the operation is in\nparticular excellent \u2013 he is as menacing as he comes across in the trailers\n(\u201clook at me\u2026look at me\u2026I\u2019m the\ncaptain now\u201d he says. And we\u2019re all\ninclined to believe him), and his hostile one-on-one face-off with Hanks\nworks exceptionally in the film\u2019s fa-vour. There is a certain level of humanity each pirate shows throughout\nthe film, and it\u2019s in these character\ninteractions the film becomes unique\nin showing us a balanced look at both\nsides of the story.\nHanks is of course as effortlessly\nconvincing as ever from the begin-ning, but his performance hits a real\nhigh point in the film\u2019s final moments,\nas everything crescendos in scale and\nintensity along with his portrayal of\nthe real-life character on screen.\nThere is an issue with pacing towards the end as the film tries to sustain its tension for as long as it possibly can, for around two hours. The\nUnited States government takes absolutely forever to get a plan in place,\nwhich is both worrying (good) and\nfrustrating (bad) for the audience, the\nlatter feeling taking over as the rescue mission starts rolling out a touch\ntoo slowly. The sun rises and falls at\nwarped speed, making the timeline\ndifficult to fully get your head around,\nbut given the note-perfect ways in\nwhich the film opens and closes, this\nshows you can count on anything Paul\nGreengrass and Tom Hanks get their\nhands on.\nAll is Lost\nDirector: J. C. Chandor\nWriter: J. C. Chandor\nStarring: Robert Redford\nRuntime: 106 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nThat Robert Redford is 75+ and actually walked away from this film set\nalive is unbelievable in itself. The ordeal he\u2019s put through for J. C. Chandor\u2019s survival thriller looks positively\ninsane, and although the credit mentions the use of a stunt double, there is\nno doubt this must have been a daring,\nphysical shoot for the veteran actor.\nA couple of things to be aware of\nbefore going to see the film: there is\nonly one person in the cast. Only Redford stars in the film and really, that\u2019s\nmore than enough. He has plenty of\nthat old-man star power and charisma\nto power through the film. Something\nelse to bear in mind: there is virtually no dialogue. Aside from the opening narration and a couple of scenes\nwhere Redford quite understandably\nuses curse words, Our Man (that\u2019s\nthe credited character name) says not\nmuch else. And yet All Is Lost is one\ncompelling thriller of man vs. nature\nwhere it\u2019s the man\u2019s resourceful resilience that shines through.\nSlight damage to the side of his ship\nturns out to be the least of Our Man\u2019s\nproblems. Yes, there\u2019s a hole through\nwhich sea water is entering, but after\nsome precise, methodical repair work,\nhe\u2019s back on track out in the open sea.\nThis is of course until a massive storm\ndecides to strike. With sinister sound\nof the wind and heavy rain, things get\nworse and worse for Our Man as he\u2019s\nhit with one back luck after the other.\nThe poor old man is tossed and\nturned around time after time as\nmother nature proves to be a force too\npowerful for any skilled man at the sea\ncan realistically handle. The alarmingly high waves and hail-like rain is a terrifying sight to behold, and the scale\nof every disaster is simply astonishing,\nwhich makes it easy for the audience\nto be genuinely concerned and frightened for Our Man\u2019s safety. The camera\nfollows him around in whatever situation and this strangely documentary-like style is a compelling one, closely\nobserving each and every step of his\nfight.\nIt\u2019s an uplifting, triumphant tale of\nthe human survival spirit, overcoming whatever seemingly impossible\nobstacle that comes your way, with a\nmuted yet powerhouse performance\nfrom Redford. Essentially this can be\nsummed up as 2012\u2019s Life of Pi except\nwithout the animals, and with more\ndisaster ship-wreck scenarios.\nThe scope may be a narrow one for\nsure, but you won\u2019t find yourself wishing for more faces to make up the\ncast - because Redford on his own can\nmore than hold his own, in this thrilling new adventure from a very young\nand promising director.\n\n"

When he was a\nchild, he spent his time\noutdoors in the natural\nworld, but now all his\nchildren do is stare at screens and\nobsess with big brands. He sets out\nto change things, appointing himself\nMarketing Director for Nature. This\nwitty and irreverent documentary\nfollows his antics as he attempts to\nlaunch a national marketing campaign\nto get children back enjoying the\ngreat outdoors. Described as \u201cLike\nDavid Attenborough and Morgan\nSpurlock got drunk and had a baby\u201d\nby one watcher at the She\ufb03eld Doc\nFest where the \ufb01lm premiered this\nsummer, it\u2019s sure to be an interesting\nwatch.\nFelix caught up with the man himself,\nfresh out of the BBC newsroom where\nhe\u2019d been preparing an edit of the \ufb01lm\nfor Newsnight.\nThe \ufb01lm release is quite soon now,\nso how are the preparations going?\nIt\u2019s going really well. We\u2019ve got over\n50 cinema screenings, which for a\ndocumentary is really an amazing\nrelease, and we\u2019re going out all over\nthe country, which is really amazing.\nWe\u2019re really pleased to be playing\nat Imperial. We\u2019ve had a couple of\ninterns working on the \ufb01lm who\nwere at Imperial, so we feel quite\nconnected. Noah Baker and Andrew\nMehigan were both interns with us.\nSo that\u2019s one of the reasons we rang\nImperial Cinema \u2013 \u201cyou should screen\nit as your guys have been working on\nit\u201d.\nThe preparations are good, we\u2019ve\ngot loads of events going on at the\ndi\ufb00erent screenings. It\u2019s been a hell of\na ride. It\u2019s been 3 years in the making,\nso it\u2019s been pretty terri\ufb01c.\nI love the style of the trailer, the idea\nof socking it to the big brands in a\nlanguage they understand. Since\nyou are setting yourself up as the\nMarketing Director for Nature,\nwhat\u2019s your elevator pitch?\nIt\u2019s the ultimate product. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s\nfree and it\u2019s good for you. And there\u2019s\nalmost nothing in the world you can\nsay that about... except maybe sex,\nalthough that\u2019s not always true for sex\neven.\nWhy did you take the approach of a\nbig brand to the idea?\nactually not true, in fact it\u2019s slightly the\nother way round according to a study\npublished on Wednesday by the RSPB.\nAlso, the discovery how universally\nloved it is as a product, how weirdly\nwe don\u2019t choose it as it has been\ndisplaced by these other better\nmarketed products.\nThose were the two big things that\nstruck me \u2013 that nature is a product,\na thing to go and consume, (there\u2019s\nsomething weird about describing it\nas a product because it\u2019s free and we\u2019re\npart of it in a sense), but at the same\ntime, being able to set it up and talk\nabout it as an option for enjoyment.\nA kid would have a pie chart for what\nthey do, and nature, the outdoors,\nwould be one chunk of that. And I\nguess what I saw my job as doing was\nto try and grow that segment of the pie\nchart. And I just loved discovering just\nhow much children love it, and adults\nof course. Everybody loves being\noutdoors, but people don\u2019t choose\nit, and I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s a kind of\nmarketing and branding problem.\nThis \ufb01lm has got quite a wide release\nfor a documentary? How did you\nmanage it?\nWe came up with the idea, and\nraised money from various sources,\nincluding BritDoc and Channel 4,\nand some private places, including\nthe National Trust, the RSPB. We\nwere tremendously lucky in raising\nthe money to release it. In terms of\ngetting the release, it\u2019s just got to go\ndown well. We played it at the big\nI\u2019ve got two young kids, so I noticed\nthat they are much more into the\ntelly and computer games and toys\nthan going outdoors. When I get\nthem outdoors, they really love it.\nAs a product, they love consuming\nit and they really enjoy it, but they\ndon\u2019t choose it, and that struck me\nas probably a branding problem. I\nwanted to compete with the brands\nthat they do choose, even though they\ndon\u2019t enjoy them as much as going\noutdoors. They do choose Disney and\nNintendo and Apple and CBeebies.\nPartly that\u2019s because the stu\ufb00 that\nthose guys have got to o\ufb00er is not\nnecessarily good for them but quite\naddictive, but its partly because there\u2019s\na lot of advertising and branding that\ngoes on, around, well in the case of\nDisney they own Marvel now, so\neverything my son\u2019s got is Spider Man\nnow \u2013 he\u2019s kind of saturated with the\nMarvel Brand, so I guess I wanted to\nsee what it would look like if I tried to\nsaturate his life with the nature brand,\nwhether it would have an e\ufb00ect.\nWhen you were doing all this, did\nyou \ufb01nd anything very surprising\nwith your experience?\nThere\u2019s some things that people think\nabout nature that really aren\u2019t true.\nPeople think that it\u2019s the preserve of\nthe wealthy, the middle classes, to\ngo frolicking in nature. Actually we\ndiscovered that the disconnection of\nchildren from nature cuts across class,\nwealth and geography. You\u2019d like to\nthink that people in rural places are\nreally well connected with nature and\nthat people in cities aren\u2019t, but that\u2019s\nEuropean documentary \ufb01lm festival\nin She\ufb03eld (She\ufb03eld Doc Fest). Lots\nof buyers came and saw it there,\nit was a packed house, and people\nreacted really well. It\u2019s funny because\npeople laugh when they watch it. I\ndon\u2019t think people were expecting\nit to be funny. I think we were quite\nlucky that we managed to pull that\no\ufb00, because it\u2019s a really serious issue\nabout how we are going to connect\nwith the environment in the future,\nand whether our kids are going to give\na toss whether species die out or not.\nSo it\u2019s a heavy subject and it\u2019s also got\nan element of heaviness in it because\nit\u2019s about what we ought to do, it\u2019s got\na bit of a government information feel\nto it \u2013 that you ought to eat 5 a day,\nyou ought not to smoke, you ought to\ngo outdoors, but I think we managed\nto avoid it feeling like a \ufb01lm that does\neither of those two things, either that\nis really heavy about the issue, or feels\nreally preachy, by just having a lot of\nfun making it. And also cooking up\nthis slightly crazy caper where I tried\nwith no money and not very much\ntime, to do a nationwide marketing\ncampaign for a nonexistent product\nwhich we cooked up. Well, it\u2019s out\nthere, but we employed ourselves as\nit\u2019s marketing directors.\nApart from you, who\u2019s the team\nbehind it?\nIt\u2019s me and my longtime producer who\nI worked with on a number of \ufb01lms,\nAshley Jones. Then the core team is\nLorraineO\u2019Donovanandsomecamera\npeople and editors who come and go,\nbut really the core team is just three of\nus. We have some researchers, which\nis why we worked with people from\nImperial, although Andrew was also\nassistant producing. And then now,\nobviously, we\u2019ve got publicists. So it\u2019s\na really long and di\ufb03cult process, but\nthe core team is really quite small.\nWhat would you say inspired your\ndocumentary style?\nI really love documentaries that are\nirreverent, and fell like an adventure.\nI really like what Morgan Spurlock\nand Michael Moore do, and I\u2019m\nreally in\ufb02uenced by that kind of\ncampaigning, active \ufb01lm making. I\u2019m a\nbig fan of the Yes Men. On TV I really\nlove Louis Theroux. In terms of the\nlook, we\u2019re just so lucky with cameras.\nWe shot it all on a C300 camera, which\nis around \u00a310,000. Ten years ago it\nwould have been a \u00a3200,000 camera.\nAnd then of course we chose the visual\nstyle of the animations \u2013 there are\nanimated sequences which are very\nlively and quite humorous and light,\nso rather than going through a series\nof documentary scenes to explain the\nscienti\ufb01c bene\ufb01ts of nature, we just go\ninto a 90 second animation about it.\nWhat is the big goal of what you\nwant this to achieve with this \ufb01lm?\nThe creation of this \ufb01lm has brought\ninto existence this out\ufb01t called the\nWild Network. It\u2019s a network of\norganisations and individuals who\nall want to campaign to get children\nmore connected with the outdoors. It\nincludes the National Trust, the RSPB,\nthe NHS some big brands like Arla\nGeorge Goldberg\nReporter\nProject Wild Thing - Coming to a\nGREEN LIONS\n\n"

    "content": "34 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nTELEVISION\nEditors: John Park,\nEmily Fulham\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJohn Park Television Editor\nScandal: Season 2\n2012-13 Television\nT\nhere is absolutely nothing\nOlivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her team of\nfast-talking crisis management consultants can\u2019t han-dle. Pope rocks her flawless outfits,\nspeed-walks everywhere, goes in and\nout of The White House as if it was\nher holiday pad, always with a clear\nstrategy in mind, and ultimately she\ngetsthingsdone.Handlingthepress?\nDone. Getting ahead of your op-ponents? Check. Helping the next\nPresident-hopeful secure his votes?\nOf course. She sure must charge big\nbucks for her services and she\u2019s certainly worth every penny of it.\nAs with any Shonda Rhimes dra-ma, Scandal too, has a flair for the\ndramatics, and loves to take absurd\nideas and turn them into feverishly\nentertaining guilty-pleasure. Pope\u2019s\naffair with President Fitzgerald\nGrant III (Tony Goldwyn) was established early on in season 1, in the\nshow\u2019s pilot no less, but the followup season takes on a whole new level\nof scandalous (pardon the pun), as\nPope\u2019s past involvement in a deep-level political conspiracy comes back\nto haunt her.\nWhereas the first season was\nmostly episodic in nature, the series\nrenewal must have given the writers\nconfidence to build in a large season-long story-arc into the show, thus\nforever ending episodes in cliffhang-ers, making its ever-growing audience figure beg for even a minute\nmore of the next episode. Olivia\u2019s big\nsecret involving several powerful figures in the government is the main\nfocus, and the more ridiculous everything gets, the more irresistible the\nshow becomes. Almost everyone is\nsomehow connected in this vast de-ception, and remember the season 1\nfinale in which Quinn Perkins\u2019 (Katie\nLowes - increasingly more useful as\nthe series progresses) identity was\nleft up in the air? This is also a part of\nwhat Olivia is trying to keep buried.\nIt\u2019s no secret the show wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to survive without Washington\u2019s non-stop confidence and\ncharisma, which explains her Emmy\nnomination for her work on the series (although her deserving win was\nsnatched up by Claire Danes). No\nmatter how ludicrous the dialogue,\nno matter how uncomfortably invasive the close-up, Washington truly\nis a force to be reckoned with, and\nnot many actors would be able to\nhandle the dizzying amount of ma-chine-gun-like script constantly firing off words in endless arguments.\nPope\u2019s team of self-proclaimed\n\u201cgladiators\u201d consist of Harrison\nWright (Columbus Short), Abby\nWhelan (Darby Stanchfield), Huck\n(Guillermo D\u00edaz) and Quinn - all of\nthem doing their bit to chime into\nthe rapid game of who can say the\nmost words as dramatically as possible in the least amount of time,\nand it\u2019s not only her employees who\ncan speak like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\nWithin The White House itself is an\ninternal power struggle that is happening that involves the President,\nhis Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene (Jeff\nPerry), the First Lady Mellie Grant\n(Bellamy Young), and the VicePresident, the bible-bashing, rigorous Christian Sally Langston (Kate\nBurton) who is constantly plotting to\novertake the Presidency. All of them\ntruly excellent in their roles, making their endless juicy drama all the\nmore watchable.\nThe constant plot twists and reveals make it difficult at times to\nfully keep up with everything that is\ngoing. Someone you believed to be\na traitor one week is quickly exonerated the next, and the entire plot\nmoves at warp-speed. Those who\ndon\u2019t appreciate the pathetic President of the United States never coming to grips and always aiming his\ntired puppy eyes to Olivia will not\nfind their little high-school romance\ndrama in the least bit entertaining to\nwatch, but \u201cScandal\u201d has a whole lot\nmore to offer that more than makes\nup for the little strands that it could\ndo without. It\u2019s no wonder the second season finished with a record-breaking high in terms of ratings and\naudience number. Pope & Associates\nare here to stay, and they\u2019ll keep fixing problems, half of which will no\ndoubt be their own doing through\nreckless lifestyle choices.\n\n"

Fish are friends, not food? You have unfinished business? With great power comes\ngreat responsibility? You want to play a game? Tell us all about it: film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNo one can hear you scream\nGravity\nDirector: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\nWriters: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Jon\u00e1s\nCuar\u00f3n\nStarring: Sandra Bullock, George\nClooney\nRuntime: 91 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nGet ready for the cinematic experience of the year. Hopefully you\u2019ll be\nseated in the biggest 3D screen you\ncan find with the best speakers surrounding you (hint, hint: go to the BFI\nIMAX). There is loud music, with captions reading \u201clife in space is impossible\u201d. The music grows louder...and\nlouder...then suddenly, nothing. And\nwith a beautiful yet equally terrifying\nshot of the Earth from outer space,\nbegins Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s much-hyped,\nbox-office-record-breaking sci-fi\nthriller, Gravity, easily one of the best\nfilms of this year.\nDr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and\nMatt Kowalski (George Clooney) are\non a mission in space. The details surrounding this aren\u2019t so important, as\nsoon they are bombarded with debris\nfrom a Russian satellite that jeopard-ises not only their mission (screw that)\nbut also their lives. With zero gravity\nDr Stone finds herself spiralling wildly\nout of control, and with her oxygen\nlevels falling drastically with every\npanicked breath she takes, she and the\nmore experienced astronaut Kowalski\nneed to work together to even dream\nof landing back down on Earth.\nFrom the get-go Cuaron\u2019s film is an\nadrenaline machine that churns out\nscene after scene of nail-biting ten-sion. Even when very little is happen-ing, the extremely tight atmosphere\nin which the characters communicate\nvia message transmissions, this alone,\ncombined with that view of Earth\nis enough to send shivers down the\nspine.\nWith every crash and bang the suspense builds to epic proportions, and\nwhen the helpless humans are flung\nabout, the desperation for survival is\nfelt through the two effective perfor-mances; particularly that of Bullock\u2019sand hers is one the film\u2019s finale hinges\non to make a real emotional impact,\nwhich it most definitely does.\nCuaron always finds the perfect vantage point for the audience to witness\nthe events unfold, going so far as to\ntake the camera inside Bullock\u2019s astronaut helmet, seeing the narrow view\nof everything she sees, truly adding on\nthe fear factor. The flawless special ef-fects, the fantastic music notched up\nto maximum volume are all technical\naccomplishments worth mentioning,\nand it\u2019s no wonder James Cameron\nwas floored by this film.\nYes there may be scientific inac-curacies. And yes, the rousing finale\nbacked by a loud vocal chorus is without doubt corny and 100% what Hollywood is all about. But so what? All that\nis completely overshadowed by the\nimpeccable filmmaking at work here.\nThe Fifth Estate\nDirector: Bill Condon\nWriters: Daniel Domscheit-Berg\n(novel), David Leigh (novel),\nLuke Harding (novel), Josh Singer\n(adaptation)\nStarring: Benedict Cumberbatch,\nDaniel Br\u00fchl, Laura Linney, Stanely\nTucci\nRuntime: 128 minutes\nCertification: 12A\nJohn Park\nFilm Editor\nWho knew a fictional retelling of the\nbiggest leak of classified information\nin history could be this boring and\ntedious? According to Bill Condon\u2019s\nnew WikiLeaks movie, Julian Assange\n(England\u2019s favourite new bachelor, the\nrising Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch) and his partner Daniel Berg\n(Daniel Br\u00fchl) make their website an\ninternational sensation by standing\naround and arguing with ego troubles sometimes getting in the way of\nthings.\nDespite the incredibly sensitive nature of the information the protagonists are dealing with, there is no real\nsense of tension, not even when the\nUnited States government (comprised\nof Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci in\nwhat must be the most thankless roles\nof their careers) gets involved; the\nonly highlight that comes out of this is\nwhen all the embarrassing transcripts\nfrom within The White House are\nreleased.\nIt\u2019s a light, but a surprisingly long\nrecap of what sort of happened: and\nAssange\u2019s image remains relatively\nintact, thanks to Cumberbatch who\nrocks the bleach blonde hair and a\ncompetent Aussie accent.\n\n"

    "content": "16 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nBOOKS\nEditor: Maciej\nMatuszewski, Eva\nRosenthal\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSimon Singh has returned with a lovely new\nbook all about the role that mathematics has\nto played in the longest running and arguably\nmost successful animated television show\never. What that means exactly is far from ob-vious, but in reading the book it appears as\nthough the whole show may have actually\nbeen \ufb01ller whilst high level mathematics has\nbeen subtlety broadcast for years with few\npeople noticing.\nIndeed,whenlookingattheacademicbackgrounds of the people who came together\nmake The Simpsons the credentials read more\nlike those on the roster of some start up tech\ncompany: maths majors, computer science\nMasters, PhDs in applied mathematics and\nresearch scientists. All these brains walked\naway from their dreams careers in cutting\nedge research and instead took the cowards\nway, out opting for an easy life writing for a\ncultural phenomenon. But the appreciation\nand itch to continue playing with their intellectual roots lead to the whole Simpsons back\ncatalogue being littered with some advanced\nequations and numeric concepts.\nAfter chronicling how all these geeks found\nthemselves in The Simpsons writing team Singh goes on to explore some of the interesting\nand out-there topics that found their way in\nto episode and passed the non-maths-mind-ed by. A great many of the maths motives demand a much greater explanation, and Singh\nis all too willing to provide it in insightful and\noften humorous ways.\nOne splendid example is the episode \u2018Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\u2019\n, in which Homer becomes partly obsessed by Thomas Edison and\ndecides to take up invention. Between working on the electric hammer and the make-up\napplication device (which is essentially a shotgun loaded with make-up) we see his blackboard littered with equations. One predicts a\nmass for the Higgs Boson, another the curvature of the universe and a third scrawling\nis a solution to Fermat\u2019s last theorem. This is\nthe same theorem that plagued mathematics\nfor hundreds of years and was only demonstrated to be unsolvable as recently as 1995.\nHowever, this episode was broadcast in 1998\nand seems to contradict Andrew Wiles proof.\nTesting Homer\u2019s solution on a pocket calculator reveals it to work, which is very troubling.\nIt turns out that David S. Cohen wrote a program to sweep for solutions to Fermat\u2019s last\ntheorem to within 0.000000002% accuracy,\njust enough not to show up on the ten digit\nreadout of most calculators. Sneaky, and funny on a entirely di\ufb00erent level\nTogether with a raft of mathematical jokes\nrequiring varying levels of maths ability, the\nbook was a real pleasure to read from start to\n\ufb01nish. Sometimes informative, sometimes hilarious and often startling to learn what concept and ideas made it into the show.\nHaving read Singh\u2019s previous publication\nTrick or Treatment: Alternative Medicine\nStudent Picks\non Trial I honestly can\u2019t say I was expecting\nanything like this. With the knowledge Singh\nmust have racked up campaigning for libel\nlaw reform and appealing his libel case I was\nrather hoping he\u2019d present us with a whimsical history of just that, packed with hilarious anecdotes, which would both inform and\nentertain. One can empathize with his not\ndoing so however, as it clearly wasn\u2019t a battle he sought, but rather was dragged into\nfor doing little more than calling a spade a\nspade. Though in his case it was actually calling chiropractor\u2019s treatments bogus. Despite\nhaving all the scienti\ufb01c evidence on his side\nBritish law came down on the side of business\ninterests rather than empirical demonstrabil-ity. Going back to his own roots of popular\nmathematical writing, using The Simpsons as\na jumping o\ufb00 point to talk about things like\nnarcissistic numbers, the use of statistics in\nbaseball and topology would seem like a far\nmore appealing thing to be getting on with.\nHe wastes little time in reasserting his newly found rights that he was instrumental in\nbringing about though. The Defamation Act\nbecame law in April of this year, though only\ntime will tell the extent to which its powers\nwill be asserted in the courts. Nevertheless,\nSingh references one episode in which Homer is forced to abandon a spinal manipulation device he invents by the chiropractors of\nSpring\ufb02ield so they can, in Singh\u2019s words, get\nback to \u2018happily promoting their own bogus\ntreatments\u2019\n. The particular reference doesn\u2019t\nactually serve as a set-up to any larger mathematical point, but is something that Singh\nmust be happy seeing hitting the shelves up\nand down the country right now.\nBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula is one of the most famous works\nin the English literary canon and it has served as inspiration for countless other works, yet surprisingly few\npeople that I\u2019ve met have the book itself. This is a great\nshame since this is a truly fantastic novel.\nGiven how deeply the story has penetrated into the\npublic consciousness I think there is no need to give\nan outline of the plot. Dracula, however, is a far deeper\nand more profound novel than most of its adaptations\nconvey. The \ufb01gure of the Count himself is a constant\nshadow over the proceedings of the novel, appearing\nboth suave and charming but also appealing to our\ndeepest, primal fears. It is no secret that it is this character \u2013 a complex creation who has generated countless\nanalyses from the literary establishment \u2013 is the main\nreason for the lasting appeal of the novel.\nThe book is also helped by its style \u2013 which, even\ntoday, many would consider at least somewhat avant-garde. The story is told entirely in the form of diary en-tries, newspaper clippings, letters and even transcripts\nof phonograph recordings. This presents the goings on\nfrom many di\ufb00erent viewpoints \u2013 not only maintaining the reader\u2019s interest but adding to the depth of the\ncharacters and setting \u2013 allowing Stoker to build up a\nvery dense mythology and backstory for his tale in a\nway which seems very natural.\nThis is a rare treat \u2013 a book combining tension and\nintrigue with genuine literary merit.

But you would be grossly\nmistaken. This summer, despite my\ninitial reservations (an admission\nto appease my persuaders, just in\ncase they\u2019re reading), we travelled to\nIceland.\nI initially complained about the lack of\nsun, summer, and activities on o\ufb00er,\nbut from the moment I stepped foot\non Icelandic soil, I fell completely in\nlove. Contrary to my complaints, the\nsun stays up in Iceland for around\ntwenty hours per day, and in the\nsummer it never really gets dark at all.\nThe people played a massive part in\nchanging my attitude. Everyone I met\nwas helpful, calm and easy-going. One Icelandic attribute I came\nto admire is patience, something\nthat is severely lacking in our hectic\nLondon lifestyle.\nTo say that the scenery left\nme speechless would be an\nunderstatement. It\u2019s surprising how\nmuch green a country called ICEland can have, and the variety seen\nacross the country is astounding.\nOne can admire the magnitude of the\nicebergs, which change formations\neveryday due to extreme weather\nconditions and global warming. There\nare also many mountain formations\nwhere waterfalls suddenly make their\nappearance. Iceland is a country\nsusceptible to volcanic eruptions,\nand volcanoes have contributed to\nthe formation of the ground: rather\nthan sand or rocks, the coastline is a\nplethora of rich, volcanic ash.\nAside from the beautiful countryside I\ntruly adored the capital city, Reykjavik.\nIt\u2019s a fairly small city with around\n120,000 residents, and everything is\nwithin walking distance. The city is\ncomprised of a well-presented centre\nwith many shops and restaurants.\nThere are also two huge shopping\nmalls just outside of the city, ideal\nfor the colder and wetter days and\neasily reached by public transport or\nfree minibus. The National Museum\none of the most organised and well-presented museums I have visited to\ndate, and it is well worth a visit.\nOf course, it would be impossible to\ntalk about Reykjavik and not mention\nits countless swimming pools. I\u2019m not\nentirely sure what crazy, adventurous\nspirit possessed me, but I decided to\nvisit two of them. The water itself is\nlovely and warm, but it\u2019s the transition\nin and out that really makes you shiver.\nStill, it\u2019s an unforgettable experience,\nand one you ought to try at least once.\nThe element of the city that made\nme fall in love the most with was\nthe seaside. One can walk by the sea\nfor endless hours and admire the\nmountains that surround the area.\nThere are also boat tours that take you\nfrom the city into the more remote\nareas of the ocean, to encounter\nwhales and Iceland\u2019s answer to the\npenguin: the pu\ufb03n.\nOverall, it\u2019s an experience that will\nstay with me for the years to come.\nIceland is a truly breath-taking\ndestination, and so di\ufb00erent to many\nother places you might encounter. I\nsuggest planning a visit during the\nsummer season, as the cold is more\nmanageable, and the chances of sun\nare much higher. It might not be your\nstereotypical summer, but the endless\nadventure is not to be missed.\n\u201cYo listen up here\u02bcs a story about a little guy that lives in a blue world. And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue\u201d - Bj\u00f6rk, 1999\nLOUKAS PETROU\nRumour has it that Bj\u00f6rk runs naked across these rooftops, but only when you\u02bcre not looking And this waterfall: beautiful, right? Think again. It\u02bcs actually connected to Bj\u00f6rk\u02bcs toilet\nLOUKAS PETROU LOUKAS PETROU\n\n"

    "content": "39\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 18 OCT\nFOOD\nMichael Chung made a classic with organic vegetables from London\nA few weeks back we mentioned the\nFarmers\u2019 Market, but that is not the\nonly place to get fresh vegetables on\ncampus! The ICU Co-op has a new\npartnership with Sutton Community\nFarm, which is about 13 miles from\nSouth Kensington. Fresh, seasonal\nvegetables are harvested every week\nand distributed around London via its\nVegBag scheme. All the vegetables are\nfarmed organically and it is quite environmentally friendly because of the\nlow carbon footprint. The content of\nthe bag is also kind of a mystery - since\nall the goods is seasonal, but typically\nit will contain potatoes, onions and\ncarrots at the very least!\nHere at Felix Food, we ordered a\nmedium VegBag to try. For \u00a311.50, we\nalso got some kale, half a pumpkin,\nsome pea pods, courgettes, garlic and\nsoome lovely tomatoes.\nAnd what exactly can you cook with\nthe VegBag? Let\u2019s be honest, winter\nhas arrived. After a long day of lec-tures, problem sheets and tutorial, all\nwe want to do is to have some hearty\nwarm food and watch the One Show.\n(Okey, none of us at Imperial will be\nback at home at 7pm, perhaps just in\ntime for EastEnders repeat at 10...)\nOne of the traditional winter dishes\nare pies. The English have been enjoying meat pies since the Middle Ages\nand there was even a poem written\nabout it in the 14th century. With the\nlovely vegetables from the Veg Bag, it\nwas easy to make a healthy shepherd\u2019s\npie - which in fact dates back to 1870s!\nIngredients: (Serves 4-5)\n- Olive oil\n- 3 garlic gloves, peeled and \ufb01nely\nchopped\n- 3 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce\n- 500g lamb mince\n- 2 large potatoes\n- 3 carrots, chopped\n- 2 sticks of celery, chopped\n- 400g chopped tomatoes\n- 1 red onion, peeled and chopped\n- 110g butter\n- 200ml milk\n- 250g grated cheese\nPreheat the oven to 200o\nC. Heat the\nolive oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and add garlic, chilli, onion,\ncelery and carrots. Cook on the medium heat for about 5 mins until soft.\nUp the heat and add the mince when\nthe vegetables are soft. Cook for another minute.\nAdd Worcestershire sauce and\ntomotoes, season well.\nCook for up to an hour - the longer\nyou cook it, the more meaty and\ndelicious it will taste!\nWhile the meat is bubbling away,\nbring a large pan of water to the boil\nand add the potatoes. Cook until soft,\naround 15-20 mins, depending on the\nsize.\nDrain and mash well, add the butter\nand milk, season with salt and pepper.\nPour the meat sauce into a large ov-enproof dish. It should \ufb01ll about half\nthe dish.\nCarefully spoon the mashed potatoes\nover the top.\nSeason, then sprinkle with grated\nCheddar cheese.\nPlace on a baking ray in the oven for\n30-40 mins until golden and bubbling.\nTo go with my shepherd\u2019s pie, I also\nstir fried some of the kale with oil and\ngarlic - couldn\u2019t be simpler!\nAnd there you have it! And if you\ndon\u2019t like lamb, you can also use mince\nbeef to make a cottage pie. You can\nalso add di\ufb00erent vegetables into the\npie, such as mushrooms and peas. The\nopportunities really are endless!\nWinter: Prime Time For Pies\nSeven More Years of chocolate eating\nSoaring demand in emerging markets meets lower production\nIt is the London Chocolate Week\nthis week and many chocolate-related\nevents took place across the capital.\nWhile the public is enjoying the new\nvariety of chocolate, the industry experts who met at the British Library\nhave some bad news for the chocolate\nlovers. They predicted the world will\no\ufb03cially run out of cocoa beans on\nOctober 2, 2020 - that is in 7 years\u2019\ntime.\nChocolate taster and expert Angus\nKennedy reportedly said there will be\na chocolate shortage in the near future since experts have projected that\n2.3 globes worth of land is required\nto accommodate the world\u2019s needs of\nchocolate. Kennedy also mentioned\nthat much of the space used for cocoa\nproduction are replaced by rubber\nplantation as farmers get a better\nyield.\nOn top of that, major cocoa production countries has experienced\nbad weather, along with growing\ndemand has led to a 17% increase\nin cocoa over the past 12 months\n- which contributes to the rise of\nchocolate bar production cost by 25%\nin the same period.\nIn fact, the demand for cocoa beans\nis so high that it is now the second\nbest prfomer in the Standard & Poor\u2019s\nGSCI gauge of 24 raw materials, after\noil. Euromonitor International has\nestimated that global sales volume\nof chocolate confectionery will gain\n2% this year and 2014. BRIC contries\ntakes a major role in this growth, demand in China is projected to expand\n11% annually in the next 5 years, 13%\nin Brazil, 22% in India and also 8% in\nEastern Europe.\nSo next time when you want a\nMars Bar with your cup of co\ufb00ee,\nyou might have to pay more than you\nthink!\nWant to try\na VegBag?\nsuttoncommunityfarm.org.uk\nOrder the bag you want and select\nICU Co-op as the pick up point.\nYou will have to order by\nSunday midnight for a Thursday\npickup at the Co-op in Sher\ufb01eld\nBuilding foyer from 4:30pm.\nAny questions please email\ncoop@imperial.ac.uk\nWhat\u02bcs in the bag I hear you ask?

    "content": "FRIDAY 18 OCT 27\nTHE GRADUATE\nTessa\u2019s Top Ten Tips for Graduation\nC\nommemoration Day at\nImperial is pretty well\nlabelled, signposted and\nexplained, and it\u2019s pretty\ndi\ufb03cult to fail to do any\nof the essential parts. But as with\nanything else, it\u2019s good to be aware of\nany potential stumbling blocks so that\nyou can streamline your day. And so\nas a voice of potentially embarrassing\nexperience, here are some tips that I\nwish someone had given me.\n1. Get your gown as early as you\ncan. It might seem like overkill to\nget there the full three hours before\nthe start of your ceremony, but with\nyour parents and younger sibling in\ntow, all good intentions can go out\nthe window, and you\u2019ll end up leaving\nlate. They\u2019re grown adults, and can\n(probably) make their way to Imperial\nby themselves, so why not run ahead\nand pick up the gown by yourself? It\ngives you more time to run around\npretending to be a bat/wizard before\ntheir judgemental eyes arrive, and\nyou can make them super proud by\nmeeting them at the tube in your full\nregalia. The key thing that you want to\navoid is going the cross-London sprint\nin your graduation clothes. I had to\nmake this run in heels, and the race\ninduced sweating made my hair go\nfrizzy. Your proud parents are going\nto whip out the photos from your\ngraduation for the rest of your life, so\nit\u2019s important to make sure that you\nlook your best.\n2. If you do manage to wrangle your\nwhole family to College nice and early,\nleave the \u2018rents outside the Great\nHall while you pick up your gown.\nEde and Ravenscroft dress you in it,\nso you don\u2019t need your parents to do\nanything, and they\u2019ll really just clog\nup the system. While Mother Hen\nmight still love to help, the faster\neveryone can get through the Great\nHall, the more time you have to take\njumping pictures in front of the Albert\nMemorial.\n3. It can\u2019t be emphasised too much\nthat girls need to bring safety pins to\nsecure their gowns. Bring lots, bring\nspares for your friends! Unless you\ncan pin your gown, it\u2019s going to be a\npain in the arse all day. The sta\ufb00 giving\nyou the gown can\u2019t pin them for you,\nso get a friend to help you (unless\nyou\u2019re exceptionally skilled and can\ndo it yourself, of course), or head out\nof the hall to get your parents to do\nit. It gets pretty frantic in the Great\nHall, so the last thing you want to do\nis add to anyone\u2019s stress by getting in\nthe way. You should also remember\nthat you\u2019re going to be wearing an\nextra layer of heavy material all day, so\nditching your jacket with your parents\nis a good option. It gets pretty warm\nin those gowns, so don\u2019t forget to put\non deodorant!\n4. In the Royal Albert Hall, you\u2019ll be\nseated alphabetically by degree type.\nAs you\u2019ve been studying with these\npeople for years, you\u2019ll probably know\nthe people you\u2019re sitting on either side\nof you, who you can nudge and giggle\nwith throughout the ceremony. But if\nyou don\u2019t, it\u2019s never too late to meet\nnew people. If the person you\u2019re sitting\nnext to looks a bit sad and lonely, or if\nyou need to talk to someone new out\nof necessity, you can still have a great\ntime. Can\u2019t think of anything that\nwould necessitate overcoming your\nsocial awkwardness to talk to someone\nnew at this point? I happened to be\nsat next to my recent ex-boyfriend,\nwho didn\u2019t seem to be overly keen\non chatting with me. (If you\u2019re not\ngraduating yet, I recommend avoiding\nthis at all costs. If you must date\nsomeone in your class, try and stay\naway from your end of the alphabet)\nI\u2019ve never been more grateful for the\nsort-of-acquaintance on my other\nside, who kept me entertained the\nwhole way through. Just because you\u2019ll\nnever speak to them again, it doesn\u2019t\nmean that you can\u2019t be graduation\nBFFs.\n5. You might be worried about falling\nover on stage. You\u2019ll be trying to juggle\na lot of things: keeping your gown\nstraight, the handshake-walk (at all\ncosts, do not pause!), and possibly\ninconvenient clothing like heels, or a\nsari. It\u2019s a big ceremony, and a lot of\npressure. But what I \ufb01nd reassuring, is\nthat if you trip, it will be with all eyes\non you, in the Royal Albert Hall, one of\nthe most well known buildings in the\nworld. That doesn\u2019t sound like a good\nthing, and while most Imperialites will\n\ufb01nd that kind of attention terrifying,\nafter a few years (or a few pints) it\nwill be a fantastic anecdote. If you do\nstumble, and someone will, remember\nto style it out. A full-on fall requires\na bow, and if you pull it o\ufb00, you\u2019ll\nbe a hero. Almost worth doing it on\npurpose, isn\u2019t it?\n6. After the ceremony, there is the\nhighlight of the day: the champagne\nand canap\u00e9 reception. I can\u2019t\nremember the canap\u00e9s, but I can\nremember the champagne. My key\nadvice here is to remember that while\nit is free alcohol (woo) and you\u2019re with\nall your friends who you might not\nhave seen since exams \ufb01nished (double\nwoo), your parents are also there,\nand it is not appropriate to attack\nthe champagne with your usual zeal.\nYou will be very overexcited, and may\nnot have managed to \ufb01t in breakfast,\nso it will go to your head. A bit of\ngood spirited tipsiness is perfectly\nacceptable, but getting full on wasted\nis not. I managed to drink enough to\ndo my usual 2 or 3am drunk texting\u2026\nat around midday. Classy.\n7. There are photographers in Beit\nQuad all day, but as anyone who\u2019s ever\nbraved the Union on Commemoration\nDay will know, the queues for\ngraduation photos are insane. There is\nplenty of time to get one taken either\nbefore or after your ceremony, but if\nyou\u2019d rather not stand around for ages,\nregressing to a sulky child who wants\nto go o\ufb00 and play with their friends,\nthere are also photographers in the\nQueen\u2019s Tower Rooms the day before,\nwhere they lend you a gown for the\nphoto. For less traditional photos by\ncamera wielding parents, classic spots\nare the steps in front of the Albert\nHall, the lions by Queen\u2019s Tower, and\nin front of RSM.\n8. It\u2019s tempting to keep wearing the\ngown as long as you possibly can, just\nto make the most of it. As long as you\nreturn it by 8.30pm, there don\u2019t seem\nto be any restrictions with running\no\ufb00 with it. Whether you want to take\na whistlestop tour of London in your\nbat-cape, or just go out for dinner with\nyour parents, you have to make the all-important decision of whether or not\nto return it before you leave. Especially\nif you\u2019re coming back in the evening, it\nmight be tempting to keep it on, just\nto let your parents eke out the pride\na bit longer. Remember that you will\nattract a lot of attention outside of\nSouth Kensington, and you might get\na bit fed up of it after a while.\n9.Alotofpeoplewillgooutwithameal\nwith their family on Commemoration\nDay, which is a mine\ufb01eld of things\nto watch out for. As there are several\nceremonies, this could be lunch or\ndinner, and either before or after the\nchampagne reception. Although you\nmight just want to go and hang out\nwith your friends, your graduation is\nalso for your parents, and so you\u2019re\nfairly honour-bound to spend a bit\nof time with them. After all, they\u2019ve\nprobably paid for the tickets, right?\nDeciding not to brave the Eastside\n\u201ccelebratory menu\u201d, I had to \ufb01nd\nsomewhere to eat that wouldn\u2019t cause\nmy father to grumpily mutter, \u201cit\u2019s all\nthe same anyway, foreign food, isn\u2019t\nit?\u201d, which is surprisingly challenging\nin London. With that decided in\nadvance, I just had to navigate the\nnon-perpendicular streets of Covent\nGarden to the restaurant in Covent\nGarden while su\ufb00ering the aftere\ufb00ects\nof the vast quantities of champagne,\nwhich was enough of an achievement\nfor the day.\n10. Going to the Union in the evening\ncan be a fun way to get all your friends\ntogether when you might not have\nseen them in a while. Most people\nwill still be in fancy clothes from\ngraduation, and anyone who can drink\nfrom a tankard will be drinking from a\ntankard. It\u2019s really nice to see everyone,\nbut expect the Union to be like a\nsports night, but worse. The queues\nat the bar will be horrendous, and as\nwell as the recent graduates, there will\nbe a lot of too drunk athletic types in\nties. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the Union\nif you just want to chill out with your\nclose friends, but if you want to bump\ninto every acquaintance you\u2019ve made\nduring your time at Imperial, and\nmake vehement promises (that you\nwon\u2019t keep) to add them on Facebook\nand stay in touch, then it\u2019s the best\nplace to be.\nCommemoration Day marks the end\nof your stint as an Imperial student (or\nat least an undergraduate one) and you\nshould absolutely make the most of it.\nIt\u2019s a di\ufb03cult combination of friends\nand family, but with a bit of care\nyou can easily appease your parental\nresponsibilities and catch up with all\nyour friends. Massive congratulations\nto everyone who\u2019s graduating this\nyear, and good luck in whatever you\u2019re\ndoing with yourself next!\nTessa Davey\nComment Editor\navey\nEditor\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON\n\n"

    "content": "8 FRIDAY 18 OCT\nEditors: Philippa Skett,\nKeir Little, Fiona Hartley\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSCIENCE\nUtsav Radia on a new step to neurodegenerative disease treatment\nThe MRC Toxicology Unit research\nteam, led by Professor Giovanna\nMallucci at the University of Leicester,\nhas managed to successfully control\nthe progression of Prion disease, a\nneurodegenerative disorder, in mice.\nThe study, published in Science\nTranslational Medicine, shows great\npromise for human neurodegenerative\ndisorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s, which\na\ufb00ects around half a million people in\nthe UK.\nIn Prion disease, the build up\nof abnormally folded proteins\nover-stimulates cellular control\nmechanisms within the brain that\nswitch o\ufb00 the production of all\nnew proteins. Without certain vital\nproteins, the nerve cells within the\nbrain struggle to send and receive\nmessages and eventually become\nstarved.\nThis control mechanism is supposed\nto be self-regulated, so that protein\nproduction \u2018turns on\u2019 again when\nthe misfolded proteins have been\nremoved. However, in mice with\nPrion disease, the abnormal protein\nlevels continually increased, resulting\nin protein production being kept\n\u2018switched o\ufb00\u2019. This would eventually\ntrigger the death of the brain nerve\ncells.\nThe team had previously trialled a\nmethod using proteins that blocked\nthe pathway for the \u2018o\ufb00 switch\u2019\nso that new protein production\ncould continue in presence of other\nabnormal proteins. This time, the team\nwas able to use an orally administered\ndrug-like compound which, once in\nthe bloodstream, was able to cross\nthe blood-brain barrier and block\nthe same pathway that switched o\ufb00\nall new protein production within\nthe brain. The compound worked by\ninhibiting an enzyme, PERK, which\nin the presence of high levels of\nmisfolded protein, would trigger cell\napoptosis (controlled cellular death).\nThis enabled the nerve cells within\nthe brain to survive in the presence of\nabnormal proteins, thereby restoring\nsome brain function and preventing\nfurther memory loss.\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, parts of the\nbrain start to atrophy causing the\nformation of beta amyloid protein\nplaques and neuro\ufb01brillary tangles,\nknown as tau tangles. Amyloid\nproteins are abnormally folded and\nhence the build up of these can\ndisrupt and damage the cholinergic\nneuronal cells within the brain that\ncarry messages to and from the CNS,\ngradually destroying them. Slowly,\nthis disease can spread to other areas\nwithin the brain, further damaging\nour ability to process thought, speech\nand memory.\nProfessor Mallucci con\ufb01rms that\nthe \u201ccompound has completely\nprevented neurodegeneration\u201d in the\nmice studied. However, there were\ncertain prominent side e\ufb00ects on\nthe mice, including damaging e\ufb00ects\non the pancreas which caused mild\ndiabetes and weight loss. The next big\nchallenge is to transform this method\nof treatment into human patients with\nminimal side e\ufb00ects.\nProfessor Morris, of King\u2019s College\nLondon,saysthat,\u201cThis\ufb01nding[...]will\nbe judged by history as a turning point\nin the search for medicines to control\nand prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d So\nfar, we have only been able to control\nthe symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s through\nAChE inhibitors such as donepezil\nand NMDA receptor antagonists like\nmemantin.\nWhether this new research will\nenable us to revolutionise the way\nAlzheimer\u2019s can be treated, only the\ncoming years will tell.\nBreakthrough towards curing Alzheimer\u2019s...\nALZHEIMER\u02bcS DISEASE EDUCATION AND REFERRAL\nallows vesicles to merge with target bodies to transfer their\ncontents, Randy Schekman discovered a set of genes that are\ninstrumental in directing vesicle tra\ufb03c, and Thomas S\u00fcdhof\nunearthed how electrochemical signals are processed by\nvesicles to release their contents accurately and precisely.\nThe signi\ufb01cance of their work, though apparently simple\nand fundamental in nature, is crucial in understanding this\ndelicate system within the human body. Any disturbances or\ninconsistencies in the vesicle tra\ufb03c system can lead to long-term adverse e\ufb00ects upon general health, and are known\nto contribute to many major medical conditions such as\ndiabetes, immunological problems and neurological disorders.\nPeace\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition and Control of\nChemical Weapons (OPCW) received this prize not for one\nparticular campaign but a cumulative e\ufb00ort over decades in\ntrying to eliminate and outlaw the use of chemical weapons\ninternationally. Such weapons were infamously deployed in\nboth World Wars, and have also been more recently used\nby terrorist organisations, with current media focus on the\nalleged use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people.\nSince their formation, the OPCW has led e\ufb00orts to prevent\nmanufacture, ensure destruction and eradication of chemical\nweaponry, receiving the support of over 180 countries to\ndate. Although heavyweights such as the USA and Russia\nhave not acceded to the OPCW\u2019s strong recommendations,\nthere is growing international pressure for this to change, all\nthanks to their e\ufb00orts for a peaceful and more secure world.\nPhysics\nResearchers and experimenters of CERN, working at the\nLHC in Geneva, Switzerland, capped nearly 40 years of\ntheoretical study and experimentation to \ufb01nd certain physical\nevidence for the existence of the Higgs boson, a particle\nincluded in the Standard Model. It was hypothesised by\nmodern particle physics to be crucial in giving all elementary\nparticles the property of mass. Its discovery proved the\nexistence of the Higgs \ufb01eld, which bestows this property,\nachieved by attempting to produce the boson by accelerating\ntwo streams of particles to extremely high energies (in the\nregion of Teravolts) and causing them to collide head-on.\nTheawardingoftheprizehasbeencontroversialasamultitude\nof people had been involved in establishing the Higgs boson in\ntheoretical physics, and more involved in the experimentation\nto obtain physical evidence. The Nobel Prize\u2019s policy is to\nonly allow up to three people to share an award, which this\nyear went to Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. Besides\nthem another colleague, Robert Brout, was also considered\nto be a frontrunner to share it, but he passed away in 2011.\nMedicine\nVesicle tra\ufb03c is the transportation system of molecules\nwithin our bodies at the cellular level, in packages called\nvesicles. Three researchers shared this prize, although\nthey did not directly collaborate on a speci\ufb01c study: James\nRothman unscrambled the protein machinery which\nNobel prizes announced\nChemistry\nThe Nobel Prize for Chemistry this year was awarded to three\nscientists for their work in multiscale modelling of complex\nchemical systems. Martin Karplus of the University of\nStrasbourg and Harvard University, Michael Levitt of Stanford\nUniversity and Arieh Warshel of the University of Southern\nCalifornia, began their work in the 1970s, using computational\nmodels to simulate and study chemical reactions. Over the\nyears, the methods became more sophisticated, and their\napplications expanded to include well-known biomedical\nproblems such as protein folding and drug design.\nWhen applied to large biological systems such as\nproteins, however, most computational methods encounter\na problem of scale: the di\ufb03culty in simultaneously\nmodelling both the atom-level chemical properties and\nthe large-scale behaviour of the overall system. The work\nof the Nobel winners provided a way to bridge this gap,\ncombining quantum mechanics with classical physics.\nComputational methods and their advocates, unfortunately,\noften meet with scepticism from experimental scientists.\nIn Imperial\u2019s own Life Sciences department, there are\nreports of early-career academics having had to play\ndown their interest in theoretical research when applying\nfor jobs, with one senior lecturer dismissing the entire\n\ufb01eld as \u2018nonsense\u2019. This historic award should \ufb01rmly\nestablish the importance of theory in modern science.\n\n"

They often break down into\nlighter particles in an attempt to\nattain stability; the Higg\u2019s Boson was\npredicted to break down into a W\nboson, which could then break down\nfurther into a lepton, among other\ncombinations.\nThese breakdown products were\nwhat the LHC was trying to detect,\nand would be measured by Atlas or\nCMS- they manifested as anomalies in\ndata output, represented as \u201cbumps\u201d\non an otherwise consistent line on\na graph. These bumps represented\nan unexpected excess of gamma rays\nor other decay residuals; possibly\nfrom the aftermath of a Higg\u2019s Boson\ndisintegration.\nBumps in the data were common,\nbut through repeated collisions were\nsmoothed out as they disappeared\nthrough the realms of statistical\naveraging. It was only when the bumps\nremained, and became less anomalous\nand more predictable, that the two\nteams started to sweat.\nTruthinscienceisallaboutstatistical\nsigni\ufb01cance. If the odds of something\noccurring are above a certain\nquantitative threshold, it is considered\nto be a truth, and the highest threshold\nfor this determination is considered to\nbe a \u201c5-sigma level.\u201d This means that if\nthe odds of something taking place by\nchance are less than 1 in 3.5 million,\nthen you can con\ufb01dently state that\nwhat is occurring the other 3,499,999\ntimes is the norm, and can be heralded\nas the truth.\nA persisting bump on the graphs of\none team corresponded to a gamma\nray of mass of around 128 billion\nelectron volts. The gamma rays\nproduced by the Higg\u2019s Boson decay\nwere theorised to lie between 115\nbillion to 200 billion electron volts\nof energy, so as the bump persisted\nin the datasets produced by particle\ncollisions, excitement, coupled with\nthe characteristic skeptism all good\nresearchers harbour, started to grow.\nIt was team Atlas that was fortunate\nto nurture this bump throughout\nrepeated tests until its occurrence had\nreached a 3-sigma level: the chances of\nit being a systematic \ufb02uke were only 1\nin 740.\nCMS were also seeing important\n\ufb02uctuations of energy, this time in\nthe form of a \u201cfour-lepton\u201d signal. The\nresults were almost at a 3-sigma level,\nand it seemed that both Atlas and CMS\nhad simultaneously and independently\ncracked the code. Neither could boast\na 5-sigma signi\ufb01cance however, so the\nrace was still on.\nDr Heuer, the Director General\nof CERN, revelled in these \ufb01rst\nhints of particle discovery, so set up\na symposium in CERN. Dr Heuer\nreasoned that a sigma signi\ufb01cance\nof 4.9 would not be enough to call\nsomething a discovery, but two\nexperiments boasting such a value\nwould combine to make a sigma value\nthat would be enough to tilt the scale\nin favour of statistical signi\ufb01cance.\nIt was now a matter of combining\ndata in the right way to produce that\nstatistically sound support for the\nboson\u2019s existence.\nItwasasolitarygraduatestudentthat\n\ufb01nally produced results that breached\nthe 5-sigma level, but the discovery\nwas not ultimately con\ufb01rmed until\nanother pair of graduate students had\nbrought all the datasets together and\ncombined them to produce a result\nof a signi\ufb01cance level of 5.08-sigma.\nThey had \ufb01nally found the boson.\nThis result was the combination\nof datasets spanning 1,000 trillion\nproton-proton collisions, resulting\nin the formation of 240,000 possible\nHigg\u2019s Bosons, 350 pairs of gamma\nrays and 8 sets of lightweight\nparticles from the lepton channels.\nThe two teams presented their\nwork simultaneously at the CERN\nsymposium on July the 4th , 2012, with\nthe whole world watching. CMS went\n\ufb01rst, followed by Atlas, and then Dr\nHeuer declared that they had indeed\nfound a previously unknown particle.\nDrHiggswaspresentintheaudience,\nwas seen to be crying as the ripples of\nthe news began to spread from the\nCERN epicentre to right around the\nworld. Follow up data analysis was\ndone, and on the 14th of March, 2013,\nit was tentatively con\ufb01rmed to be the\nHigg\u2019s Boson.\nSo who really did deserve the Nobel\nPrize? Some people suggest that in\nreality, those at CERN who made the\ndiscovery should be heralded with the\ngreatest accolade that mankind has to\no\ufb00er, whilst others are still squabbling\nabout the theoretical history of the\nparticle and who exactly should be\nrecognised for theorising the boson in\nthe \ufb01rst place.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of\nSciences announced last week that\nPeter Higgs and Francois Englert had\nwon the prize \u201cfor the theoretical\ndiscovery of a mechanism that\ncontributes to our understanding\nof the origin of mass of subatomic\nparticles, and which recently was\ncon\ufb01rmed through the discovery of\nthe predicted fundamental particle, by\nthe ATLAS and CMS experiments at\nCERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider.\u201d\nCERN was not attributed with\nthe Nobel Prize for its role in this\nmarathon, and it could be humoured\nwhether or not Higgs would have even\ngot the prize if the particle\u2019s existence\nhad not been proven. Needless to say,\nthe unfolding of the discovery of the\nboson is a great story to tell, and no\ndoubt will become one of scienti\ufb01c\nlegend as the years pass.\n\n"
