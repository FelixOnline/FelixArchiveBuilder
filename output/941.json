    "content": "Opinion\n18th September 1992 Felix 941\nBeit\nBack\nWinter is over in the People's Republic of Imperial College Union\nand spring is about to burst into full\nbloom as the new year starts. For\nthe sabbaticals the lazy period of\ntheir one year tour of duty is over\nand the new year is about to start.\nSo have the 'new' sabbaticals been\nbroken-in and house trained by their\nrespective members of staff?\nMr Beavan hasn't done any\nwhoops ies on the carpet since the\nlast issue of Felix 6 weeks ago, but\nmy, that was a biggie. One potential\nlaw suit that was thankfully cleared\nup, and an irate UL U President\ncomplaining about blatant breaches\nof their staff protocol. Naturally,\nwe apologised and explained that\nwe had never received a copy of it.\nFelix attempted to obtain a copy\nearlier this week, only to be\ninformed that said article was\n'under negotiation'.\nThe whole issue of staff protocol\nis bound to crop up every Friday.\nAlthough there are reasons behind\nstaff protocols, it would seem from\nlast year's evidence that they are\ninvoked to cover up any and many\npotentially embarrassing situations.\nRecent press reports concerning the\nDianagate tapes and the Mellor\nfootball fantasies have not been\nreceived with a mass call for a 'Royal Protocol' or a 'Minister for\nFun Protocol'. National media\npersonalities must regrettably\naccept that their personal lives could\nappear in the popular press in the\npublic interest. Most people agree*\nwith this principle, the question is\nwhat is in 'the public interest'.\nStudent Unions are a microcosm\nof the real world. We have our own\ngovernment, our own elected\nrepresentatives, our own civil\nservice, our own laws, discipline\nsystem, and our own shops. It is\ntherefore up to the main media in\nthis union and college to conduct\nthemselves responsibly.\nNo one has published which\nmembers of college management\nhave been sleeping with each other\n(or discussing which football strip\nthey wear in bed), though we would\nhave no hesitation in doing so if\nthere was a whiff of financial\nirregularity. Similarly, what\nsabbaticals get' up to in their own\nprivate rooms is up to their own\nconscience and the Metropolitan\nPolice, if they get caught. However,\ntheir activities when they are\nrepresenting the Union, or in the\nUnion building, is well within the\nstudent's right to know.\nDetails of the staff/sabbatical\nworking relationship may be\ncommon knowledge amongst the\nregular users of Union facilities,\nthough the rest of the students\nremain in ignorance. Under a staff\nprotocol they would have no right\nto know how the sabbaticals and\nstaff are working, and working\ntogether, but yet is there not a right\nfor the students to know how their\nelected representatives are\nbehaving?\nViews expressed in this\narticle are not necessarily\nshared or supported by the\neditorial staff of Felix or\nImperial College Union.\nBreak of Cons u etude Dear Editor,\nThank you for sending me the\nJuly issue of FELIX. Unfortunately\nthere are two comments I must\nmake about the article 'Sabbaticals\nasked to leave'.\nThe first is that the article\ninsinuated that the Sabbaticals were\nasked to leave by the University of\nLondon (ULU). The officers were,\nin fact, requested to leave by the\nmember of Wye College staff\nresponsible for the course's accommodation.\nMy second disapprobation is that\nthe article referred to members of\nstaff by name. This is a serious\nbreach of the cons u etude which\nstaff consider requisite to working\nin a Students' Union.\nI hope FELIX will publish an\napology for acting un professionally. Yours faithfully,\nMark Samuels, President.\nRector Response Dear Mr Beavan,\nThere is no need for a student\nnewspaper to be benign; ruffling the\nfeathers of those presumed to be in\nauthority is part of an ancient\ntradition. I do think however that\nyou should have commitment to\nfactual accuracy. You owe this to\nyour readers\u2014students, staff,\ngovernors. Your front page article\nin the 31 July issue contained\nnumerous errors of fact\u2014facts\nwhich were readily available had\nyou preferred them to fiction.

    "content": "Reviews\n1 8 th September1992 Felix941 Film\nThe New Queer Cinema\nThis season celebrates all aspects of\ncontemporary gay and lesbian film-making, without being judgemental.\nThe aim of this project seems to be\nmerely to present Queer Cinema to\nthe audience so that they form their\nown opinions rather than choosing\nthe pieces for their artistic merits in\nthe first place. It presents pieces\nfrom the brilliant, to the obscure,\nto the frankly dire. The epitome of\nthe spirit of this venture is 'Flesh\nHistories', a series of 'shorts'\nshown together in two, hour-long,\nprogrammes. All that binds these\nblips of brazen film together is the\nsexuality of the director/writer\nand/or actors. They range from the\nsuperb and shocking, T Object' and\n'Yes Means Yes, No Means No',\nthrough the enlightening and\neducational 'Safer Sex is Hot Sex'\nand 'Kissing Doesn't Kill', to the\nclich ed symbolism of entering\nvarious doors, (the entirety of the\nfilm 'Getting In').\nThe effect of the whole\nprogramme is to leave you stunned,\nas it is rare to see such a collection\nof starkly sexual and bizarre images\nin such close succession. It is worth\nseeing this programme because the\ngood outweighs the poor and\nclich ed( and you get to see some\nerect penes).\nThe season also includes 'the\nHours and the Times', a film which\nfantasizes what may have happened\nbetween Brian Epstein and John\nLennon whilst they were on holiday\ntogether in Barcelona. I loved the\nuse of the beautiful Gaudi\narchitecture as a backdrop for the\nclose but awkward relationship\nbetween the two men. The fact that\nwe are still left uncertain as to how\nfar their relationship went, does not\ndiminish the impact of the film,\nMusic\nBone Machine, Tom Waits\n'Originally I was going to take\nsounds of machines I'd recorded\nand add a really strong rhythmic\nsense; I was going to try to build\nsongs out of the rhythms. But then\nit didn't really develop that way.\nThe stories kind of took over. So\nit's more bone than machine. Bone\nMachine...we're all like bone\nmachines, I guess. We break down\neventually and we're replaced by\nother models. Newer models.\nYounger models. Bone\nMachine...sounds like a superhero,\ndoesn't it?' Thus Waits describes\nWilliam Dafoe in White Sands\nwhich transcends all the technical\ndifficulties they encountered to\nbecome a rather touching vision of\nhuman relationships. The fact that\nit is about two famous people in a real situation, which was the topic\nof much contemporary debate, was\nnot as important to me as the way\nthat the film dealt with the effects\nof having a close friend who is gay.\nHaving said this, Ian Hart is quite\na convincing Lennon and the whole\nfilm is an interesting piece of\nspeculation.\nThe New Queer Cinema Season\nalso includes a conference on the\n19-20th September debating and\nlooking critically at contemporary\ngay cinema, a Bruce La Bruce film\ncalled 'No Skin off my Ass' and a sneak preview of 'Swoon' by Tom\nKalin.\nMad Granny.\n\u2022 Showing at the ICA until 27th September for more details phone\nthe Box Office.\nWhite Sands\nThis film is a hell of a lot better than\nthe blurb suggests. Superficially, it\nis about a small town cop\nhis first, entirely new, album since\n1987's 'Frank's Wild Years', apart\nfrom the live 'Big Time' album and\nrecently the soundtrack to Jim\nJarmusch's 'Night on Earth'.\nHe's developed a new\npercussive ly led grainy style which\nhas a homegrown, backyard feel\n(Waits has used various old tape\nrecorders, and recorded the thing in\nhis own shed using various metal\nobjects and crowbars instead of\nchains'. His subjects are more\nexperimental, going from 'issue-oriented' tracks like 'Earth Died\nScreaming' and the political 'In the\ninvestigating a suspicious death and\nthe half a million dollars found with\nthe corpse. The sheriff's attempts\nto solve this mystery lead him into\nthe seedy world of undercover FBI\nagents, sultry heiresses and\ninternational gunrunning.\nThe weak-sounding plot is saved\nby the stunning backdrop of the\nNew Mexico desert and\ncommendable performances by\nWillem Dafoe (as Deputy Sheriff,\nRay Dolezal), Mary Elizabeth\nMastrantonio (the horn interest) and\nSam Jackson (the 'ethnic minority\nsenior FBI officer without... a bug-stain on his record'). The script has\nenough pace and twists to maintain\ninterest and keep you guessing.\nApart from an excruciating Rodeo\nscene, an even more cringe-worthy\nrendition of the Star Spangled\nBanner, and an over enthusiasm for\nkilling minor characters, this film\nis surprisingly well done.\nMad Granny and\nFluffy Bunny Feet.\n\u2022 'White Sands' is on general\nrelease.\nColliseum' ('They're especially\ngood for an election year' jokes\nWaits) to the dark storytelling songs\nlike 'Murder in the Red Barn' and\nthe demonic 'Black Wings'.

Christopher Columbus:\nThe Discovery\nLand ho, or something like that.\nJohn Glen's \"Christopher\nColumbus: The Discovery\" has\nsome nice scenery and a few choice\nbits of acting here and there but is\nmostly a dreary retelling of the\nColumbus legend.

Is Columbus (a handsome\nbut lightweight George Corraface)\nthe good-natured family man who\nsucceeds against all odds in\n'discovering' America or the half-mad zealot who terrorizes and\nplunders the natives he finds there?\nThe movie never makes clear and\nby the end, you really don't care.\nRachel Ward makes a grating\nQueen Isabella but Tom Selleck\nI doesn't embarrass himself too badly\nas King Ferdinand.

    "content": "'eat ure18 th September1992 Felix 941\nScientists under Scrutiny\nFelix 941\n'eat ure18 th September1992 Samin Ishtiaq examines the ethics of the education of scientists. While David Spooner replies, making\ngratuitous use of Oscar Wilde.\nPerhaps Stephen Hawking's book,\nA Brief History of Time, re-started\nthe whole debate. The last part of\nthe book, with its 'ominous'\nprediction about cosmologists\ndiscovering the mind of god,\nbrought out orthodoxy and radical\nalike. We are now showered with\nmore books, articles, even TV series (BBC2's Pandora's Box)\nabout the place of science in\nsociety. Is science evil? Has science\ncorrupted our souls?\nThis is an old debate, of course,\nprobably unlikely to be resolved.\nMainly, I think, because the whole\ndebate about the 'goodness' and\n'badness' of science and technology\nis on the wrong plane. We may as\nwell be arguing about the weight of\nyellow. Science, like Oscar Wilde's Robert Pursig\ndescribes it best\n'science is a pile of amoral\nobjective\nmatter.'\nArt, is not moral or immoral.\nRobert Pirsig (whose latest book\nLi7a was opinion ed at recently in\nthis column) describes it best:\n'science is a pile of amoral objective\nmatter'. In other words, science just\nis. Pirsig, in fact, links the current\nmoral confusion to the fact that\nscientific analysis, having led the\nintellectual revolution in the 60s, is\nnot able to deal with morality.\nBut this does not mean that\nscience should not be criticised\n(Although Joe Schwarz describes\nthe lack of critics of Science in his\narticle 'Defiance of Science'\n(Guardian 13th June 1992). Just\nbecause no moral analysis of\nscience can take place does not\nmean that it should be left to get on\nwith itself. One of the main reasons\nfor this is that science is powerful.\nThis cannot be overstated enough.\nThe ability of science to alter the\nstructure of society within the\nmedium term (say 50-100 years) is\nawesome; the Pill has given woman\nphysical freedom, the machine gun\nhas given a soldier massive fire-power; robots have replaced entire\ncommunities of work-forces; the\ncar has altered the way Western\nsociety thinks and functions. There\nis little in anyone's life that is not\nconnected with what scientists and\nengineers did some years ago.\nNot that these examples are of a sociological nature. They affect the\nfundamentals of society. Whether\nNewtonian physics is overturned\nhere is of no concern. Whether\ncomputers use silicon chips or\ngallium arsenide ones doesn't matter. It's the long-term effect on\nsociety that is important.\nFor this reason alone scientists\nneed to be\u2014must be\u2014taught an\nalternative view of science. They\nneed to be aware of what science\ndoes to society. It is not enough to\nteach them the history and\nphilo so py of science; they must be\ntaught a sociological analysis of the\nimpact of science. This is not just\nto silence critics of the scientific\nestablishment by arming the\nscientists (that would be a very\ndestructive reason) but to make the\nscientist think about what he/she is\nabout to do.\nAnd this is the key point of this\narticle: scientific establishments like\nImperial College produce 'well-behaved' scientists. Scientists who\nare not aware\u2014not taught? not\nwilling?\u2014of what studying science\ndoes to the community. Scientists\nwho are unaware of the history of\nscience from a 'small man's' point\nof view.\nPerhaps there is some kind of\nvicious circle here: industry wants\nwell-behaved engineers and\ninstitutions want industry's funds\nand goodwill. I am not suggesting\na conspiracy; I am neither a fanatic\nMarxist nor of the new breed of\nGreen terrorists. I am just\nmentioning the possible instance of\na destructive relationship between\nthose who demand scientists\n(industry, government, education)\nand those who supply them\n(institutions like Imperial). The fact\nthat some spaced-out theory like a capitalist-technocrat conspiracy\nshould even be mentioned is even\nmore reason to support the\nImperial College Ltd.\nfor well behaved engineers\neducation of a reasoned,\nsympathetic scientist.\nOf course, institutions will say\nthat they already run 'humanities'\ncourses for their scientists. But\ngiving a third-year undergraduate a human it ites option is not enough.\nThere are several reasons for this.\nFor one, what will stop the student\nfrom studying Friedman on\neconomics rather than Karl Popper\non scientific discovery? Our student\nwill think: which of these\nhumanities courses will look good\non my CV? Which course will give\nme 'useful' background to the 'real'\nworld? Is a business studies course\neasier than a philo so py one?\nFor another, and this reason is\nmore pertinent, by the third year\nour student has already become a trained (brain-washed even?)\nscientist. He/she works with 'nice'\ntheories, which always have\nreasons, answers, connections,\nmeasurements. Is it now possible\nfor him/her to go back and question\nthe very need for his/her\nknowledge?\nThe point about inadequate\nscientists has been made. I think a solution lies in scientists learning\nabout relevant humanities subjects.\nAnd learning about them when it\nmatters. For instance, for a Computing Sciences student,\n'relevant subjects' would mean\ncourses with topics like 'The ethics\nof programming', 'Public and\nPrivate: the ethics of i privacy', 'Automation and Alienation'.\nHe/she could even be taught general\ncourses in philo so py and sociology.\nBut it is definitely not enough just\nto tell him/her to be mindful of the\nData Protection and Computer\nMisuse Acts; the underlying\nphilosophic ideas of privacy and\nhacking should be understood. And\nby 'when it matters' I mean early\non\u2014quite definitely in the first\nyear\u2014before a scientific mode has\nbeen fitted-on the student's brain.\n'Sure, good idea', people will\nsay. 'But aren't our courses already\noverloaded?' But what can you say\nabout a university year that is based\non some archaic Church calender (I refer to Michaelmas, Easter, etc\nterms)? And how come Norwegian\nuniversities manage to run\ncompulsory philosophy courses for\nall undergraduates? And what is\nmore important: a better\nunderstanding of and more\nintegration with Nature? Or alien is ation of and purpose-less\nscience?\nWe can forgive a man for making\na useful thing as long as he does\nnot admire it. The only excuse for\nmaking a useless thing is that one\nadmires it intensely.\nHerein is a value statement. It\nis from the preface to 'The\nPicture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar\nWilde, where Wilde outlines the\nprinciples of aesthetic ism.A value is a property of that which\nbelongs to a system of ethics, or\nwhat we call 'good'. With this in\nmind, what, then, is perception\nworth?\nScience is a human-devised\nsystem of discerning and limiting\nuniversal laws of which we\nperceive little, it is part of the\nprogression of humanity and its\nsocieties, and is as valuable to\nsome societies as it is worthless to\nothers. That some would consider\nit worthless is not in doubt, and\nthen we have something which is\nof a similar value structure to art.\nTherefore, I will not patron is e my\naudience, by telling them they\nneed to study philosophy to\nparallel their science-based\nintellectual development, as\nphilosophy is not adequately\nproficient at dealing with ethics.\nNo more so, at least, than our\nsystems of law which are already\nevident to the senses and require\nonly our adherence.\nThough I can offer no alternative,\ngreater awareness predicates a clouding of the issue within the\nphilosophy of ethics. The\nstructure of this article is my\npoint; I have demonstrated here\nexactly how useful philosophy is.\nA business studies course\nprobably is easier, and will no\ndoubt be far more useful in a free\nmarket arena. The price of\neverything, and the value of\nnothing; more fool him that\nstudies something of value.\nThe article opposite suggests\nthat scientists need to observe\nscience from another viewpoint,\ni.e., the layman's, in order to\nfully comprehend the effects of\ntheir work, and that a course of\nsomething like philosophy or\nsociology would cover up the\nperceived deficiency. That there\nis a deficiency at all is the biggest\nquestion; who, for instance is not\nastute enough to recognise that\nthe telephone made a significant\ndifference to personal\ncommunication, but is also a limited medium that cannot\ntransmit interactive and nonverbal signals, that the television\nis a 'window on the world', and\nbrings comedy and drama into\none's own home, but is a mass\nmedia tool despised by cultural\nelitists and has been condemned\nfor distorting reality, that\nreplacement limbs are of\ninestimable value to disabled\npeople, yet were the basic ideas\nbehind cybermen and other\nstories of humanity de human ising itself. A trite example, maybe,\nbut one that makes a salient point\nconcerning human intuition, i.e. that it is capable of interpreting\ndanger in the future from its\n/ have\ndemonstrated\nhere exactly\nhow useful\nphilosophy\nis\nscientific pursuits. Granted, some\neffects are recognised in\nhindsight, such as acid rain\ncorrelated to industry, but\ndebated material like the social\neffects of virtual reality\ndemonstrates how society is\nattempting to question all\neventualities regarding its\ntechnology.\nI may be wrong. There could\nbe a yawning chasm between a scientist's knowledge, and his\nperception. But how many of\nyou, as children, learned of\nmustard gas, zyklon-B, anthrax\nor the atom bomb, and imagined\nthat another, non-human species\nhad devised them? These are\nhuman names, given to\ndevelopments within the\ndisciplines of chemistry, biology,\nand physics. This is obvious; is it\ntherefore necessary that this\narticle, such as it is, alongside\nSamin's, should exist at all? Or\nis it enough that they do?\nPage 4 Page5 "

It was later revealed\nthat Mr Corfield had personally\nphoned Miss Dodd to express his\ndismay at her outspokenness.\nA spokesperson for the NUS said\nthat they had wanted to keep the\noption of voluntary membership for\nwhen the Government made\n'specific threats' towards the NUS\nand this is why they have reacted\nagainst the Sheffield University\ndocument with such vigour. The\nSpokesperson continued that this\nmatter was one that should be dealt\nwith through internal reform and\nnot through submitting proposals to\nthe government. The NUS spokesperson felt that Miss Dodd\nmust have had no other motive than\nself-publicity and that the proposal\nfrom Sheffield in no way reflected\nthe opinions of the NUS or student\nunions in general.\nAccording to the Sheffield\nStudent Newspaper, Darts, of the\nsabbaticals who have phoned Miss\nDodd from other universities, only\nBirmingham's have expressed any\nsupport.

The Women's Officer,\nSara Whittiker, stood by the\nproposal, saying 'it was very much\na joint decision'. Ms Whittiker\ndenied that anyone from Sheffield\nhad sent the proposal to Mr Patten,\nasserting instead that the proposal\nwas merely a discussion document,\nmeant for, and solely circulated to,\nNUS student unions.

After that, they plan to\nmove on to Budapest to repeat\nperform en ce.

In 1989, at the\nInternational Eisteddfod in Wales,\nthe choir won the title 'Choir of the\nYear'.

    "content": "o Felix941 pinion\n1 8 th September1992 editorial\nAs more observant readers of the\nfront page will notice, Felix\nnarrowly avoided a libel action in\nissue 940. Although our behaviour\nin printing an untrue allegation\nabout a member of the board of\nGovernors is reprehensible, the\nreaction of Senior members of the\nCollege raised some questions in\nmy mind.\nDuring the course of my\nsomewhat justifiable 'ticking off,\nI was told several things. Firstly, I should discourage any negative\ninformation about people 'who\ngenerously give up there time and\nenergies to help the College'. While\nI accept that printing lies is wrong,\nI cannot, under any circumstances,\nwithhold criticism from those who\ndeserve it, whoever they may be.\nMembers of Governing Body are\namong the most experienced and\nprofessional people in the country.\nDoes this make them above\ncriticism? I think not, even if it is\nonly the editor of a student\nnewspaper who passes this\njudgement.\nThe other implication from this\naffair is that Student Newspapers\nare in some way 'out to get' people\nin authority. How can this be true?\nWhat purpose does it serve to\nantagonize individuals simply for\nthe job they do? It is even more\npresumptuous to accuse all those\npeople across the United Kingdom\nwho produce Student Newspapers\nof such bigotry. Is it possible that\na special breed of humans exist to\nupset Senior Management? If so\nwho are they? Should they be\nrooted out and destroyed? How do\nthey breed? And more importantly\nwhat motivates this strange group?\n' Clearly such a creation is a product\nof an imagination so paranoid that,\nthe only reason they find to get out\nof bed, is because the duvet is\nplotting against them.\nMost worrying ly,a member of\nthe Felix office told me that\nGovernments grant freedom of\nspeech' and thus we should not\nabuse those in authority too much.\nFreedom of Speech is an essential\nhuman right enshrined in an United\nNations declaration and the\nAmerican constitution. If those who\npresume to run any organisation, be\nit a country or a university, try and\ncontrol that expression, they are at\nfault, not the media.\nAt the risk of accusations of\nnegativity' I have another\ncomplaint. This week I became\ninvolved in a futile and childish\nargument with a Union Office\nSabbatical. After having apologised\nfor my behaviour, a rumour\nreached me that this sabbatical had\nthreatened to get me thrown out of\nHalls because I share a room with\nmy girlfriend and I should not 'piss\noff important people' because I could get into trouble. Not exactly\na crime of the greatest proportions,\nbut certainly worth frowning on.\nWhat I object to, is the double\nstandards of someone who knows\nsomething is happening but, only\nmentions if for personal gain. So,\nhere I am, I have confessed, my\nguilt is plain for all to see. But, at\nleast I do not have to worry about\nintemperate threats, from those who\npresume themselves to be in\nauthority.\nDeadline for\ncontributions to the\nFreshers' Issue is\nMonday 28th September.\nWho's Popped off with my Wednesday\nWe have noted, with mounting\nunease, the widespread increase in\ncertain time anomalies over recent\nweeks. I will try to be as gentle as\npossible as I do not wish to cause\nundue alarm, but bizarre\noccurrences around the office are\nresulting in paranoia and mass\nhysteria, frenzied itching and hair\nbehavioural problems. I would also\nlike to apologise for the panicky and\nun reasoned passage lam writing,\nbut I'm frightened, and must leave\na document behind in case no-one\nA Time Lord: keeping s tum or killing time?\nhere gets out alive.\nIt began quietly enough; a hot\nbalmy day in the youth of August,\na Thursday, if I recall, was passing\nnormally, even, Id are say, joyfully,\nuntil one of the handbook editors\nand a man of most excellent\njudgement, declared that the day\nwas, in fact, Wednesday. We, of\ncourse, paid close attention to his\nassertion, with one eye wryly cast\nover his 72-hour wakened state,\nbefore informing him that the day\nin which we were ha biting was\nknown to one and all as Thursday.\nThis was vociferously challenged\nby said handbook editor, who\neventually conceded that the weight\nof numbers were against him, but\nswore vengeance on some cruel and\nsneaky pup for having it away with\nhis Wednesday while his back was\nturned. It was cause for some mirth,\nI can tell you, because days don't get stolen, do they...?\nThen it happened to me. A mere\nweek later, I became aware of a misplaced Wednesday of my own.\nThe Lard Clock remained resolute\nand lumpy, and would not yield the\ntruth. I searched and searched, but\ncouldn't find it anywhere. I remembered, with a pang of dread,\nthe recent loss of that other\nWednesday, and sought advice\nfrom the aforementioned\ndispossessed individual. Alas, his\nheart lay in twain, broken by the\nloss of a very personal and private\nday. Even the Metropolitan Police,\nstalwart chaps though they are,\nwere unable to help. To this day,\nthe disappearance remains a mystery.\nFor a few weeks, time passed\nquietly and remained in its proper\nplace; we thought we were safe.\nThen, suddenly and without\nwarning, while the office was busy\ncollating the handbook last week,\nnot just a Wednesday, but a Thursday also, snatched from\nexistence, and from under my very\nnose. Probably while I was putting\na slab of delicious squashy brie onto\na hunk of french stick, with maybe\na slice of cer vel at, a tomato or two,\nperhaps some freshly ground black\npepper, or maybe when I had that\nTwix, or was sitting on the toilet,\nsome wolfish chron av ore happened\nacross a substantial chunk of my\nweek, thought 'Ah! I could do with\nsome of this!' and vanished before\nyou could say 'Oh no and fucking\nred hot apfelstrudel s, some wolfish\nchron av ore has nicked a substantial\nchunk of my week!'. Since then, it\nhas spread like a nasty contagion,\nbringing people out in festering\nsores and very noses. I cut myself\nshaving this morning, too.\nWe know little of our vamp i ric assailant; perhaps it is acutely\nsensitive to peak handbook activity,\nperhaps we'll never know. I'i: 'save\nyou with a warning. Watch >o.r days carefully...\nPage3 "
