    "content": "News\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM Imperial College has settled in\nfull with its insurers concerning\nthe St Mary's fraud scandal. The\ncollege has been recompensed\nfrom the insurance company\nunder its Employee Fidelity Policy.\nThe embezzlement of funds\nis alleged to have been carried\nout by cashier, Cyril D 'Souza,\nwho has reportedly gambled all\nof the money away ( FELIX1006). Criminal and civil actions\nare at present being undertaken\nthough it is unlikely that the\ninsurers will regain the money.\nDespite college receiving\n'one hundred per cent payment'\nit remains acutely embarrassed\nby the affair, and still refuses to\ndisclose the sum that was taken.\nIt was originally reported that\nthe amount was \u00a3652,840.58\nthough college authorities have\nrefused to confirm this. Michael\nHansen, Director of Finance,\nsaid: \"It doesn't matter, college\nreceived all the money back, and\nit is not important to disclose a sum.\" Mr Hansen added that the\namount will not be published in\nthe next audited accounts. He\nwas only willing to admit was\nthat it was a 'serious fraud'\nwhich occurred over the past five\nyears.\nQuestions have been asked\nthroughout college as to why the\nembezzlement took so long to\nuncover, and why college has\nbeen so secretive over the affair.\nAn external audit is carried out\nevery year, but it failed to\nuncover the fraud. St Mary's accountants, Price Waterhouse,\nnow also audit Imperial College\naccounts. When asked if he\nthought the firm was negligent,\nDavid Thomson, Head Internal\nAuditor for College said, \"I couldn't possibly comment on\nthat\" but added that \"things may\nwell arise from the independent\nreview.\"\nTouche Ross, is due to\nsubmit this review to the Audit\nCommittee on the 24th February.\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, was guest of honour at the annual City & Guilds College Association d in ne writes Andrew Tseng. Chris Enderby was presented with the Holbein Awardfor sporting achievement.\nEntry Changes\nBY KIMBERLY WENTZ LA FF Prospective students may find a radically different university\nadmissions system as early as the\n1997/98 academic year, based on\nA level results rather than\npredicted grades.\nThe change is possible after\nan unanimous vote by the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors\nand Principals ( CVC P) on 12\nJanuary to move towards a post\nA level system. When asked why\nthe CVC P has now begun\ninvestigating options, Ted Nield,\nCVC P spokesman, said: \"There\nwas a general feeling that the\nsystem of predicting grades was\ncoming under strain because of\nexpansion, and that it\nunnecessarily put students\nthrough the mill.\"\nConsequently, the CVCP has\nformed two subgroups to look at\nways to reform the system. The\nfirst which is expected to make a proposal by this summer, will\nlook at the timetable of the new\nsystem and how it will effect the\nnext academic year.\nThe second CVCP subgroup\nwill investigate ways to use\ninformation technology to\nalleviate dead time in the system\nand speed the exam grading\nprocess. This emphasis on\ntechnology and speed, however,\nhas been met with opposition by\nthe Standing Conference of\nPrincipals (SCOP). In a statement, it argues that a 'computer-driven post-results\nsystem would be impersonal,\nassigning applicants to\ninstitutions without interview\nand without regard to students'\npersonal characteristics and\naptitudes, which are still given\nhigh priority in SCOP colleges'.\nConcern has also been\nexpressed as to whether it was\nappropriate for the working groups to look only at a post-qualifications system. The\ncommittee was reassured,\nhowever, that the subgroups are\ninvestigating all options to\nimprove the current system.\nOn the other hand, Professor\nPeter Richards, Dean of St\nMary's, supports the move to a post-qualifications system. Prof\nRichards has announced the\npublishing, in two weeks time, of\nresearch on student selection\nwhich indicates that a post-results system would be fairer to\nstudents. He also said that a reformed system would be easier\nfor universities too.\nPeter Mee, College Registrar,\ndid not know how this would\neffect Imperial, but did say that\nthe college would be watching\nthe proposals closely.\n(King's continued from page one)\nCouncillor for the London Borough of Havering, chose to\nhide behind the previous\ndecision to mislead Imperial. He\nrepeatedly denied that he, as an\nindividual, had lied.\nWhen questioned whether\nthe incident will have any effect\non his campaign to become\nUniversity of London Union( UL U) President, Ghassan\nforcefully replied: \"Why should\nit? Why should it?\" With his\nonly opposition for the\nsabbatical post being New\nElection, Karian admitted that\nhe \"should get a good result\".\nThe controversy over the\ntaking last term of the King's mascot, a stone lion called\nReggie, continues with the Royal\nCollege of Science Union still in\npossession of the sought after\narticle.\nMr Karian has insisted that\nhis Union will not regain Reggie\nthrough any form of payment,\nthe usual result of mascot ry activities. Ghassan dismissed\nmascot ry donations saying: \"It\nisn't going to involve us handing\nover 100 pints of blood, or\n\u00a310,000 for charity or anything\nstupid like that.\" In what will\nundoubtedly prove to be a controversial statement in King's College, Mr Karian said\nthat if the mascot could not be\nretrieved through discussions,\nthen the stone lion would remain\nin Imperial, 'in perpetuity'.\nEH FELIX I1PGB9S\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nTony Grew on the recoil from Natural Born Killers.\nHere's a good post-Valentines\nidea: why not take your\nloved one to see Natural\nBorn Killers? It is, after\nall, the story of two\npeople so in love they\nwant to do everything\ntogether. Both abused\nas children, Mickey and\nMallory Knox represent\nall that is pleasing about\nthe human spirit, overcoming early trauma to\nform a loving and\nrespectful relationship.\nThe fact that they take\nrevenge on the world\nthat has not been good\nto them through a murderous spree that leaves\nscores dead is a side issue, but\nwith the hype that surrounds Oliver StoVie's latest effort you may be forgiven for not knowing\nthat Mickey and Mallory have their good sides\ntoo.\nWhen we started to put this article\ntogether there was a suggestion that we should\ntry to sound out various people about the issues\nof violence and representation that NBK has\nonce again raised. But everybody was strangely\nreticent. I am sure you are all aware that four\nmonths ago the normally spineless British Board\nof Film Classification plucked up the courage to\nannounce that they would not be granting the\nfilm a certificate in this country; too violent, they\nsqueaked. Unfortunately for them their almost\nunprecedented actions did not have the film\nworld shaking in its boots: the London Film\nFestival announced that they would still show\nNBK, it sold out in less than half an hour, and\nthere were even rumours that the National Film\nTheatre were planning to show it, with or\nwithout the BBFC's permission. As well as this,\nthere were the usual accusations of censorship,\nand a cynic might\nsuggest, intense pressure from Warner Brosaware no doubt of the\namount of free publicity\ntheir movie was getting\nand anxious to cash in.\nSo the BBFC gave in. But\nwhen FELIX phoned\nthem last week they\nrefused to comment on the whole incident, or\nindeed on their policies about violence, which\nconfusingly bleats Pulp Fiction good but Natural\nBorn Killers bad, with little justification. Gracious\nin their trouncing of the censors, Warner Bros\nalso had little to say except that they are \"very\nhappy\" with the decision and hope to \"make as\nmuch money as this fine movie deserves\".\nPersonally, I have never understood what\nall the fuss was about. Having seen NBK both in\nthe US and on pirate video in London, it seemed\nno more or less violent than a dozen other\nmovies I could mention. It is shocking and at\ntimes uncomfortable, but in terms of the\nmessage and the sheer artistic merit of the film\nOliver Stone makes\nTarantino look like a kid with a cheap\nvideo camera. For\nNatural Born Killers\nmarks the apex of an\nalready remarkable\ncareer. All of the\ntechniques, visionary\ndesign and photo-his government to\nassassinate President\nKennedy, is often\npainful to watch. But\nit is real, and the\nattacks on NBK show\na basic ignorance of\nwhat Oliver Stone is\ntrying to achieve an\ninability to come to\nterms with his\nmessage. It could be\nargued that Natural\nBorn Killers is not a movie about serial\nkillers but about the\nmedia. For Stone is\nnot attempting to\ns at i rise the murders\nthat Mickey and Mallory\ncommit, but rather the way\nin which the American tabloid TV shows trivial is e the violence they are obsessed by. The movie is\nnot an exploration of the murderers, but rather\nof their media image, and once again Stone\nperfectly mimics modern America\nand its con-tra diction s. Crime is\na major issue\nof 'concern' in\nthe States. Yet\nthe public are\nStone's movies are about\nreal people dissatisfied\nwith the American\nsystem: used by it or\nvictims of it\ngraph y that have titillated by it\nmade Stone one of America's most respected\nfilm makers reach their finest achievement here.\nIt is, without doubt, the masterpiece of one of\ncinema's most under-rated talents. This is quite\nsome achievement for a man who has already\nmade movies such as JFK, The Doors, Platoon\nand Born On The Fourth Of July, all of them\nburned into the consciousness of their viewers.\nWhat Stone does\nOliver Stone makes\nTarantino look like\na kid with a cheap\nvideo camera...\nbest, and what he\nundoubtedly does here,\nis to take a step back\nfrom the issues that are\nfundamental to the\nAmerican way of life,\nthe fibre of their\nsociety. In the past he\nhas dealt with Vietnam,\nboth in the field and returning home as a veteran no-one wants to cheer: America's greed\nand the primacy of the market: the death of a President and the cover-up. But at their heart\nStone's movies are about people, real people\ndissatisfied with the American system, used by it\nor victims of it. The reality of the story he\npresents, of Ron Kovic coming to terms with his\ndisabling war wounds, of Jim Morrison sliding\ninto an early grave, or of the patriotic Jim\nGarrison slowly uncovering a conspiracy within\nand their TV responds. One only has to look at\nthe OJ Simpson trial, televised daily and in full\non CNN, to know that Stone is not\nexaggerating. In a period of three months in the\nUS last year there were 45 do cu dramas, as they\nare called, about murders, all with very high\nratings. The whole tone of Oliver Stone's movie,\nwhich we in Britain may find slightly\nuncomfortable, is painfully representative of the\napproach of American TV to the topic of serial\nkilling.\nThe criticism that NBK will cause violence,\nthat it is dangerous, is preposterous. As Stone\nsaid:\n\"During a performance of Schindler's List\nin a movie theatre in California a man got up\nand shot the person in front of him through the\nhead, but I don't see anyone calling for it to be\nbanned. If someone is capable of that sort of\nviolence then anything could trigger him. The\nmovies don't make people into killers.\"\nI recommend that you see Natural Born\nKillers, if only to find out whether you end the\nmovie as I did, feeling sorry for the American\npublic. They have been told crime is evil, yet\nthey are taught to be obsessed with it, in love\nwith it. And they wonder, with mass-murderers\nthe best known people in the country, why they\nhave such a crime rate. Makes you think. Q I1P GB95 FELIX "

Crank it up!\nget\nof\ndiaboli sm in situ\nAs the director of the deed makes\nclear in the programme, there is\nlittle fear for modern man in\nChristopher Marlowe's original 'Dr\nFaustus'. The Sixteenth Century's terror of Hell and everlasting\ndamnation can't be sustained in\nour secular age. Instead the source\nof fear has shifted from the\ndestination of our souls to the\nmanner of our death. The demons\nthat haunt us now are flesh and\nbone and wield knives. This is the\nrationale which has been applied to\n'Dr Faustus' in order to produce\n'the Deed'. Yet the tale is not so\nobvious as to be a straight transfer\nof roles from spiritual to temporal\nrealms. It's far more interesting\nthan that.\nThe play opens with an actor\npractising his lines in an empty\ntheatre; he is playing the part of Dr\nFaustus. Such is his dedication to\nthe part, he stays too long and so\nmeets the caretaker who is\npreparing to lock up the building\nfor the night. A common regard for\nMarlowe's play results in a solo\nperformance which hangs over the\nedge of normality and falls into the\noccult. Or does it? The relationship\nbetween the two men and the roles\nthat seem to envelope them is\nnever formalised, which gives the\nplay much of its ambience and chill.\nIn the original text, Dr Faustus,\noverburdened with pride in his skill\nas physician and theologian, turns\nto the dark arts of sorcery. Through\nthese he summons up\nMephastophilis, servant of Lucifer.\nTogether they strike a bargain,\nsealed with blood, that\nMephastophilis will be Faustus'\nwilling servant for all his earthly\nlife, and in return Faustus signs\naway his soul.\nAlthough 'the Deed' does not\nfollow this line exactly, the\nfundamental force of the bargain\nremains. Slipping in between reality\nand the words of Marlowe's play,\n'the Deed' weaves together a confusing but ultimately scary\nstoryline in a dramatic fashion.\nWhilst both the actors carry the\nplay with conviction, Jonathon\nPalmer (Mephastophilis) is\nexcellent. He switches between\ntragic and terrifying moods with\neasy bursts of malice, stealing all\nthe best tunes. It's not surprising\nthat he won the Drama Studio\nLondon's best actor award a couple\nof years ago.\nPart metaphysical discussion,\npart post-modern discourse, 'the\nDeed' is an intelligent and thought\nprovoking play.

Dazzling animation and alternative plot lead to most enjoyable romp.\nTrips This Term\nKeys: Chimney, Flood, Ice, Mud\nWhile \"Mountaineering\" clubs hide indoors\nduring the winter, S+G the Outdoor Club\nhas been visiting Wales and the Lake District; areas famed for their low rainfall fig-ure s. A minibus-ful (including a few renegades\nfrom the Mountaineering Club) visited\nTremadoc in South Snowdonia at the beginning of term. Some headed into the hills in\nsearch of ice climbing while others went\nwalking. The most sensible stayed at the hut\nand tried to unblock the chimney.\nUnfortunately, chimneys do not seem to be\nmade for people to hang on. A thud on the\nroof and muffled cursing told those inside the\nhut that a piece of chimney had fallen off\n(along with the Mountaineer hanging onto\nit). We tied it back together with string and\nhoped no-one would notice.\nThe fire, however, worked perfectly after\nthat and helped to dry off those who had gone\nin search of ice. The following day gave\neveryone a chance to go rock climbing on the\ncrags behind the hut. It didn't even rain\nmuch.\nThe Lake District weekend saw plenty of\nhill walking and dramatic views across the\nhills and lakes. A few determined n utters tried climbing but gave up when their fingers\nwent numb. As if in revenge for breaking the\nlast hut, we found that this one had been\nrecently flooded. The living room had 1/2\ninch of mud on the floor but a bit of shovelling meant the place was soon habitable.\nFortunately the bedroom was upstairs and\nthe river low enough for us to be able to cross\nto the pub.\nComing up is another trip to the Lake\nDistrict and one to Yorkshire. The Annual\nDinner in Derbyshire starts off the summer\nterm and the end of exams (for most) is celebrated by the Cornwall trip in June.\n(Thoughts of surfing, climbing, canoeing,\ncream teas and barbecues on the beach are\ndistinctly unhelpful on a January weekend in\nWales). The year culminates in the 3-week\nf FELIX HFEB9B\n\n"

    "content": "BackChat\nLife on the Rocks\nA Londoner born and bred, Mike Price has twice graduated from\nMSc in Th a! Physics in 1 /ith\nblok e\", he has a talks to\nDavid Cohen\nice Imperial College is - or should be - known for\nits collection of odd-ball, obsessive alumni. So\nI was not entirely surprised when I drew the\nlot to interview Mike Price, an \"ordinary\nblok e\" who wants to live forever.\nAlthough Mike left Imperial eight years\nago, after receiving his MSc in Theoretical\nPhysics, he has frequently returned to visit.\nThis occasion conveniently coincided with\none of the IEEE society's lectures, entitled\nNeural Starships. We met after the lecture\n(which turned out to be a disappointingly\ntechnical story) and headed for the SCR's comforts, away from the hubbub of College\nlife - he prefers somewhere unobtrusive and\nquiet. Mike tells me he is very interested in\nthings to do with modern technology and the\nfuture. Neural networks especially excite him\nas they are directly relevant to his rather\nirregular hobby: cryonics.\nCryonics is the science of freezing the\nbody (or parts of it) after death, so that it can\nbe revived in the future and regenerated into\nits former glorious self. Mike believes that\ntechnology will eventually be available to\nrevive and reconstruct humans from their\nfrozen matter and, although he hadn't heard\nof the eminent A I believers such as Marvin\nMinsky, is a firm believer in the philosophy of\nstrong artificial intelligence. This theory says\nthat humans are machines running very\ncomplex programs, which, theoretically\nspeaking, could be switched on and off at will\n- if only we knew how...\nIn 1981 Mike got his BSc in Physics\nfrom Imperial and, not being able to think of\nanything better to do, found a job in the\ncomputing industry. He started off as a systems programmer for a French multi-national, and later became a freelance software\nengineer, returning to Imperial in the late\neighties as an MSc student to study\nTheoretical Physics.\nHis intense fascination with cryonics\nand immortality, however, began way before\nImperial, as a result of his childhood obsession with science fiction. The fantasy\ngained in momentum and took shape when he\ncame to College in 1978 to start his degree.\nHere he met a number of like-minded souls\nthrough a small ad in FELIX. Later students\nand other professionals joined the group from\naround the country. They were to become the\ncore founders of Alcor (UK), a subsidiary of\nthe American organisation, established in\n1986, whose sole purpose is to arrange and\nprovide its members with cry onic preservation services.\nAs one of the organisation's directors, Mike is eager to explain\nwhat is offered to its members.\nFor a one-off payment of\n\u00a380,000 you are entitled to a full-body preservation;\nonce you are certified\nclinically dead Alcor will\ntake charge of the\nproceedings. The process\nis as follows: first\nanticoagulant s are\ninjected into the blood,\nwhile the heart beat and\nrespiration are kept\ngoing. Next the body is\npacked in ice and the\nblood is replaced by\ncry o protect ants to decrease\nthe damage from freezing.\nThe body's temperature is\nreduced to -77\u00b0C dry ice\ntemperature (by which time it is\nsolid) and sent to the US in an\norange freezer box, to be stored in\nArizona at -179\u00b0C in liquid nitrogen.\nMike himself is signed up for neuro-preservation (where only the brain is\npreserved). This option is not only half the\nprice but, according to him, is also safer, since\nthe box is smaller and thus easier to evacuate\nfrom the stores in case of an emergency.\nBeing a scientist by training I wondered\nif research was progressing in the field?\nApparently, although some Japanese research\nin the 1980s detected signs of life in mice\nwhich had been frozen for seven years,\ncryonics is currently not an active research\narea. However, Mike is not disheartened. He\nis confident that its development is inevitable.\nHis obsession with the future seems to\nbe his motivation in life. He sees a Utopia\nwhere people won't have to work and social\nstructures will be entirely changed. He isn't concerned about the difficulties of adaptation,\nand sees them as part of the decision to sign. I ask whether he would miss his family and\nfriends, if and when he is revived, should they\nchoose not to be frozen. He frowns, \"sure I 'll\nmiss them, yes. But ultimately my life is of\ngreater concern.\" Price is not married, nor\ndoes he have any plans to be.\nWhen I suggest that ethical or moral\nissues are involved he chuckles and dismisses\nthe\nquestion.\n\"There are no\nsuch issues once you have chosen\". Mike may\nnot be religious (in case you hadn't already\nguessed) but he is a firm believer in an\nemerging faith: technology.\nMy final question must have been run\npast him a thousand times. \"Why have you\nsigned up?\" I ask. He laughs. \"When people\ncome to me with inquiries I can tell that those\nwho ask 'why are you doing it?' will not sign\nup.\"\n\"For me,\" he says, \"it's axiomatic.\" Q For the cold-hearted the contact address is:\nMike Price\nAlcor UK\n18 Potts Marsh Industrial Estate,\nEastbome Road\nWestham\nEast Sussex\nBN24 SNH\nTel: (0181) 845 0203\nIIFEBSS FELIX BM "

'Teller' and 'Bright Yellow\nGun' are quickly dealt with and it\nbecomes obvious that this is not\ngoing to be \u2022 night for delicate\nthings. But it's not so much the\nnoise or volume that is surprising,\nrather it's both these linked to the\nspeed of delivery. Kristin skewers\nthrough the lyrics, compacting them\ntogether and spitting them out.\nLive, the Muses are a glittering\nsharp edge.\nThen strangely for a band\nwhose current album is easily their\nbestseller, they head into back\ncanon country. The crowd get a bit\nconfused; you can tell because they\nstart clapping during the pause in\n'Counting Backwards'. When the\nband finally get to finish it,\napplause in the right place, Kristin\njust says \"thank you very much\"\nbefore muttering something about\n'playing some current ones'. And\nso they go on to devastate 'Start',\n'Hazing' and 'Shimmer' before\nfalling back in time to albums past.\nAnd you just realise how far\nthey've come as a band. Greatness\nisn't just now, it's then and taking\nyour audience with you to now,\nwhich is exactly what the Throwing\nMuses have done. Every song they\nplayed belonged to them and you\njust instinctively knew it. They didn't play any songs from Kristin's solo\nalbum either.\nBy the time we get to 'Hook in\nher Head' Kristin has worked\neveryone into a state where the\nquieter tracks from 'University', for\nall their beauty, are not going to\nplayed. \"Making babies in the\nfield\" she screams and it's something primeval and intense.\nJust as the lyrics are s creed down\njagged paths so the drums and\nbass become mant ric in aspect.\nThey play one new song, unnamed,\nbut it turns like serpent swallowing\nthe still breathing form of rock 'n' roll and regurgitating something\nnew. It heralds the start of the\nMuses' escape into psychobilly\nterritory. During the time of their\n'Hunkpapa' album and before,\npeople thought the Muses were an\nart house, shout about band but\nFELIX DFEB9S\ntonight it all makes sense. As Kristin\ngrowls like an banshee from on\nhigh so the crowd only want more.\nWe've not heard most of this before\nbut we're true believers now.\nThey brings us down slowly.\n'Two steps' - the gorgeous end of\nthe 'Real Ramona' album shivers\nwhatever remains of our fears\nbefore Kristin says \"that's all, good\nnight, god bless\" and walks off. It's only ten thirty and we're broken for\nall the right reasons.\nI'm no carter us m fan, in fact\nI haven't ever really got into them,\nso I approached their latest album\n\u2022worry bomb with slight hesitation\nand didn't really expect much.\nI started listening and was\npleasantly surprised at the first\nsong, 'Cheap'n 'Cheesy'. It's one of\nthose sad, depressive type songs\nthat everyone seems to enjoy, with\nnothing but a piano ringing out a note or two while the lyrics go on\nabout being lost.\nThere are a lot of different\nstyles here. Typically distorted\nguitar sounds of alternative pop\ninterlink with some brilliant lyrics,\nespecially in 'The Life and Soul Of\nThe Party' - \"...the funeral director\ngeezer comes not to bury Caesar...\"\nThis is one of the best songs of the\nalbum, along with the calm\nmelodies of 'Ceasefire' and 'Going\nStraight' and the almost grungy\n'Senile Delinquent'.\nOverall this album is\nrecommended for anyone who has\neven a slight interest in Carter. And\neven if you don't, get it anyway -you may just become interested. (7)\nThis is one cd which can be\njudged by its cover. The\nflamingoes' new album, plastic\njewels, has a daft photo of a kid in\na superman suit on the outside,\nthree pictures of short-haired\n'moody' blok es on the inside. \"I bet\nthis sounds like Blur\", I said, and I was right. The twelve songs which\ncomprise 'plastic jewels' are all\nmelodic pop jaunts in the far too\ntrendy style of Blur, Supergrass and\nRadiohead. Some of the lyrics are\nfairly depressing but it's the sort of\nalbum you can put on as\nbackground music without anyone\nobjecting.\nTo be honest, the songs aren't anything special because there are\njust so many bands around who\nsound like this, but if you can't wait\nfor the next Blur album, this would\nprobably keep you sane. The\nFlamingoes have a lot of potential -let's see if they can develop their\nown style for the next album (6). 0\nSTOIC Schedule week ending 17/2/95\nWhat's the big idea then?

I am shit scared of that\nmember of college being me.\nHowever it is being scared that\nmakes me a cautious climber.\nWhile agreeing wholeheartedly\nwith the main thrust of Ian Parish's article; (that anyone participating in\na 'dangerous' activity should be\naware of the risks involved and\nshout if they are concerned) ; I would like to add to his point that\nmountaineering has an ethos of\n\"individual initiative and self\nreliance.\"\nTo some extent this is true, but\nwhen climbing as a pair or trio (as\nopposed to walking) individuals are\ntransformed into a team, a single\nunit, each part dependant on the\nothers. When I go climbing with\nsomeone I put my life in their\nhands and theirs is in mine; the\nobject above all is that the team\ncomes off the hill together, safely.\nPart of the reason for an\n\"unapproachable Club\natmosphere\" is surely an\nexpectation from people outside of\nthe club that a certain level of\nexperience and knowledge is\nrequired, whereas all that is\nrequired is a keenness to learn and\npush the everyday realm of\nexperience a little. A questioning\nattitude is therefore certainly\nwelcomed.\nJulian Rickard\nMountaineering Club President\nFor those who didn't read lan's article last week about the safety of\ncertain Clubs and Societies he\nadvised those who were worried\nabout activities to ask questions,\nmake a fuss, go see him, and not\nstay quiet. I think it was good for the\nMountaineering club to write in.\nSomebody obviously cares about\nsafety. However it is a shame that\nwe have to be told to ask questions,\nand to challenge judgements rather\nthan always knowing that we must\nnot accept what we are told or hear,\nand that we can change things, on\nour own or as a pair, a trio...\nPolitics Dear FELIX,\nIn response to Tim St. Clair's criticism of my letter last week as\n\"uncalled-for-one-man ship\", my\nmain aim was to counteract what\nmy members saw as biased and\nun factual reporting at the clashing\nvisits of Tony Benn and David Hunt.\nFor his information many LabSoc\nmembers have turned up to our\nspeaker events and I have asked\nmy committee members to\naccompany me to any future\nLabSoc events that do not clash\nwith ours.\nThe members of both societies\nare quite ready to listen to\nalternative views. Indeed, we are\nnowhere near as narrow-minded\nas people such as Tim.

By always picking on little\ndifferences we are not solving the\nproblems that gape between us.\nHow about a joint LabSoc, ConSoc\npub crawl with politics off the\nagenda?\nPhilosophy Dear Felix,\nHow can Mr Theocharis feel\njustified in making such rash claims\nin last week's Gatecrash column?\nHe boldly states when referring to\nRussell and Popper, 'They never cut\nacross the path of speeding trucks;\nthey never jumped unprotected\nfrom great heights.\"\nWhere, one wonders, does Mr\nTheocharis find the evidence for\nthis? Could it not in fact be the\ncase that Russell regularly cut in\nfront of speeding trucks, and yet\nsurvived unharmed? Has he not\nread accounts of Karl Popper's infamous \"Cliff Leaping\"\nexperiments? Only the other day\nan associate recounted his\nwitnessing of such an event: \"We\nwatched, as Karl stood at the tenth\nstorey window. He leapt into space,\nseeming to remain there for an\nimmeasurable time, before hitting\nthe pavement with the sound of a gunshot.

If you were to park all 13 million of\nthese cars end to end, they would form a queue\n49,000 miles long. This is the equivalent of a new\nLondon to Edinburgh motorway 130 lanes wide. Just\nto park them. When you start driving them, things\nbecome really problematic.\ntraffic, the Government has frozen all spending on\nroad building. This was partly due to the attitudes of\nthe general public in the form of protests and\n\u2022 f raron mental concerns. So we can't have more\n\u2022 p is to drive our 13 million cars on for the time\nbeing.\n\"JT\\ ut what if that policy is reversed? More of the\nIrC country will be paved for roads and parking,\nJ L# and more of the countryside will be quarried\nfor the necessary building materials. And the more\nroads there are, the more people will use them, so the\nproblem of congestion won't be reduced, it will\nsimply occur elsewhere.\nCurrently, about 36 in every 100 people own a car.

Over\nhere, that figure\nis cons? i to\nbe saturation\npoint.\nSince these 13 million people have bought a car, one can assume that they are going to drive\nthem-and drive $\nMW* S S money'sw;r \u2022 . -is huge: tl s;< \u00bb,;-. \u2022 : '\u2022\u2022 \u2022 - -he tax on\nthe cost, t' These lt\\cd costs are very high.

But the reality is the v were never on it in the first place. Owning .\n1 car\nmakes possible all sorts of new journeys.\nWith more cars, we will-need more roads.\nFollowing the admission by the Department oi\nTransport that building more roads' creates more\npoint: when everyone who can drive a car, owns a car. This is fine if you are fit enough and old enough\nto drive, and can afford one. This leaves 20 million\npeople without i ars, who lu\\ e to rely on the goodwill\noi those who have one, or what's left of public\ntransport. In an increasingly car-dominated society,\nthe amount ol money invested into improving public\ntransport is minimal, allowing its demise into a third-rate service.\nnth ony Crosland, the Secretary ol State lor the\nEnvironment in 1976, said, 'Car ownership\ni should increase, for personal mobility is what\npeople want, and those who already have it should\nnot try to pull the ladder up behind them'. In 1990,\nthe Government says that it 'welcomes the\ncontinuing widening of car ownership as an\nimportant aspect of personal freedom and choice'.\nPeople without a car have no freedom and no choice.\nIn the future, as more and more people own cars, the\nland use patterns will respond to their needs. For\ninstance, shops and businesses often relocate to out-ol town sites which can be reached by car and have\nspace for parking. As the number of cars grows, so\ndoes the incentive to own one\nWhen buying a house, car owners put a high\npriority tm the importance of parking space.\nFeature Suburban housing estates are built with this in mind.\nOlder inner-city buildings cannot accommodate\nmass car ownership, and so the more wealthy, who\ncan afford cars, live out of town, i the suburbs. This leaves those who are;}\ninner cities. The resulting\npollution, urban decay and cri| no incentive to live in the\ndownward spiral.\nV moves to\nwell-off in\n, such as\nc wealthy\ng another\nT he Government's statement about increased\npersonal choice and freedom is based cm the\ntheory that increased mobility allows people to\nmeet others with similar interests that don't live in\ntheir locality. Neighbourhoods used to consist of a disparate group of people who had nothing in common other than the fact that they shared the\nsame street. The car allowed then to meet up with\npeople from different areas with similar interests.\nWith car ownership the way it is today, this has led\nto many people not even knowing their neighbours,\nlet alone taking part in their local community. Street\nlife retreats and communities are weakened. Society\nat a local level becomes more anonymous.\nBefore the situation got this bad, people knew\neveryone in their town, however dissimilar their\nlives. If a crime as committed, the local bobby knew\nwhere to start looking, as it had to be someone local.\nNow that anyone can drive anywhere in the country,\nmany crimes don't have a hope of being solved, and\nso the problem escalates. As our world become more\nanonymous, the productivity of criminals increases.\nhe car growth rate m the UK is astounding\nenough. But in developing countries, the rate is\nfour times higher. At present, they hive a lot\nfewer cars - the whole of China has 1.4 million,\nwhich is half as many as there are in London alone.\nChina currently has one car for every 1000 people.\nThe total number of cars in China, India, Pakistan\nand Bangladesh is still less than a qua'tor oi the\nnumber in Britain. But the car population 01 China is\ndoubling every four years. China and otl -developing countries use us as an example, and aspire\nto what we now have. They see the productivity of\ntheir motor industries as a measure of economic\nstrength.\nThe US now widely admits that the staggering\nlevels of car ownership and use are causing huge\nenvironmental damage. The city of Los Angeles\nacknowledges that the transport system was a contributing factor in the recent riots.\nThe price paid by the environment is\nescalating. Western governments are relying on\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022 produce cleaner, more\nefficient engines and catalytic converters. They are\nlooking to pie-in-the-sky technologies of the future\nto cope wu h the environmental consequences ol\ngrowing car dependence.\nWith the Western World unable to slow the\nout-ol'-control demand for more cars; and the\naspirations of the Third World to compete\neconomic..:'- : - .u' act ii sn\ncatastrophic.\no what can be done to reverse the trend? How\nan we stop the potential damage? The obvious\nu solution would be to slow down production,\natul stop Third World countries from taking the\nsame path we did. But that's neither fair nor realistic.\nWe can't suddenly stop using our cars and go back to\npublic transport, because 11 wold compromise our\nstandard of living and freedom.

Overall you raised\nabout \u00a3450, the top team being from Beit Hall\nand the top collector, Chae Martyn. Scope\nhave apologised for any confusion concerning\nthe party and prizes. Unfortunately our Rag\ndid not win the free beer, but the top collectors will get prizes and all those that took part\nwill get aT shirt from Scope.\nThe City collection for today has been\npostponed until March so the competition for\nthe Inter-rail tickets won't be held until then.\nHowever, we have decided to run the competition as a raffle, rather than give the prize to\nthe person who collects the most. Each participant will be given a ticket for collecting\nplus one extra for each \u00a35-\u00a310 they collect.\nWe have now booked the minibuses for\nRag Tour so it is most definitely going ahead.\nThe details of when we are leaving, the exact\nroute and the time we are coming back will\nbe given out at our meeting so if you have\nsigned up then you should come to today's meeting at 1.10pm in the Union Lounge. If\nthis is impossible then please see one of the\ncommittee in the Rag Office as soon as p ossi ble.\nOther events going on include a collection at QPR vs. Blackburn for the Save the\nChildren fund tomorrow so sign up at our\nmeeting if you want to watch some live football for free. Also on Wednesday we have\nsome station collections for SENSE.

We will be electing\nnext year's executive committee (Chair,\nTreasurer and Secretary) before the end of\nterm so if you would like to stand come along\nto our meetings and talk to this years committee to find out what is involved.\nOtherwise just come along to vote.\nFinally, watch this space for any revelations about goings on on Rag Tour, and also\ndetails of the many events coming up in^ G33Q9lTD\nAchieving an Appetite?\nKeys: Fast, Ramadhan, Taqwa\nBy the time you read this, over a thousand\nmillion Muslims world-wide will have completed eighteen days of fasting, from dawn to\ndusk each day. Every year, the lunar month\nof Ramadhan is observed by the Muslim communities in every corner of the globe and\nalthough others may know of it, few have any\nreal ideas as to what it involves. The Muslims' fast entails complete abstention\nfrom food and drink. Some ideas are circulated along the lines of fasting being a yearly\nbout of self-denial. In fact, fasting as ordained\nin the Qur'an, has more outcomes than mere\nhunger and thirst.\n\"O you who believe! fasting is prescribed\nfor you, as it was prescribed for those before\nyou, so that you may attain Taqwa.\"\n[Translation of the Meaning of the Qur'an,\n2:183]\nRamadhan is a month of training - both\nindividual and collective. So what does it\ntrain the Muslims for? As described in the\nQur'an, the first aim is to attain \"Taqwa\",\nand \"Taqwa\" translates as \"God-conscious-ness.\" In practice, God-consciousness is\nresponsibility and accountability in actions.\nThus attaining Taqwa is vital for individual\nand collective development.\nMore precisely, an individual reaps a number of benefits of which discipline and\nself-control is top of the list. Being able to\nresist the tempting aromas of food and drink\nthroughout the day is no mean feat! To observe the fast till sunset requires patience\nand perseverance. So: we get a little hungry\nand thirsty; our tummies rumble. Where's the gain in that? In fact, rumbling tummies\nserve as an excellent reminder to the fasting\npersons of the Ever-Present God, i.e. Godconsciousness is attained. Such are the spiritual proceeds of fasting.\nWhat of the physical proceeds? Recent\nresearch has confirmed that fasting promotes\nactive cleansing of the body. Many potentially toxic substances that accumulate within\nthe various organs of the body are degraded\nand removed from the system. As with any\nsystem, thorough cleaning of the working\nparts is essential for good maintenance.\nRamadhan also sees a persistent increase\nin the community spirit among Muslims.\nThe bonds of Brotherhood are further\nstrengthened and will, hopefully, last for the\nrest of the year. As a result of acquiring\nTaqwa, Muslims adopt a more caring attitude\ntowards those around them; consideration for\nother members of society grows in the hearts\nand minds of the fasting Muslims.\nThe real meaning of Ramadhan does not\nlie in it being a \"season of good will\" as\nChristmas has come to be, but the resulting\nmanifestations of Taqwa in daily actions are\nintended to last throughout the year too.\nThose who are not trained to do so this year,\nthose who forget the lessons of fasting (and\nmy, don't we all forget so easily!) and those\nwho need to reinforce it all again, will have a chance to fulfil these requirements through\nfasting during Ramadhan next year.\nSo, Ramadhan is a month in which daily\nachievable goals are set and met while, in essence, the aims in life of global Muslims\nremain the same. What better way to direct\nthe energies of the people to become law-abiding, disciplined and compassionate citizens than through God-consciousness and its\nrigorous practice!\nIftar (meal for breaking the fast) is provided in the Islamic Society prayer room (9\nPrinces Gardens, Basement) free of charge\nduring Ramadhan; Ramadhan timetables are\nalso available. The Islamic Society welcomes\nanyone who wishes to discuss Islam.\nSummer Courses\nKeys: Ski, Exchanges, Europe\nHow did you hear about this?

    "content": "Opinion\nt use\nVisiting Jerusalem was the\nexperience of a lifetime,\nespecially for someone who has\nnever been given the honour of\nvisiting his homeland before - a place every Palestinian considers\nas a home for pride, prosperity\nand identity.\nMy dream of visiting Palestine had grown up with me.\nI felt that, by visiting Palestine, I would not only be fulfilling the\ndream of my childhood, but, in doing so, I would, feel that it was\nmy turn in life to step on the soil\non which my grandfathers lived\nand died, seeking the smell of\nliberty. I always wanted to see the\nhouse where my father was\nbrought up, the tombs of\nrelatives who long hoped of\nseeing us make this visit, the\npeople of steadfastness, friends\nwho I knew over the telephone,\nthe streets called after my cousins\nwho fell, martyrs, in the Intifada,\nand the camps of honour and\ndignity in which inhabitants live\nunder sub-human conditions.\nBut, most important of all, I wanted to visit my village, which\nI had long heard about.\nMy dream was overshadowed by tasting the agony of\nthose repelling peace and those\ndreaming of its success. Their\nproblems have cured the pains of\nothers. However, their wounds\ncan no longer be the cures for the\naching peace; their message is\n\"let us make it together... or let\nus bury it and kiss it goodbye!\"\nBut the wave of their\nmessage does not seem to\npropagate to the ears of those\nlinking their days with their\nnights building 'enclosures' or, as\nthe world wishes to call them,\nsettlements.\nMy dream was reduced to\nashes when I saw the Israeli\nauthorities still trying their best\nto bring the dignified Palestinians down to their knees in everyday life. I was shocked to\nsee the Israelis dig deep down\ninto the Arab land, trying to\nextend the dreams of many,\noffering the best of life for\nIsraelis while adding more\nbloody pages to the chapters of\nPalestinian misery; offering a first-class life to a 'first-class\nnation' at the expense of the\nfifth-class humans, as they wish\nthem to be.\nThe extension of such\n'enclosures' has done nothing but\nincreased my doubts about the\nenemy of the past. An enemy\ncoated with a 'live for peace'\nslogan. I become more doubtful\nwhen the enemy is keen to\nextend settlements on lands it\nshould be withdrawing from.\nHowever, the most disturbing experience of my visit was\nwhen I was looking anxiously for\nruins of my grandfather's houses\nin my village Aqer (Al-Ramla).\nThere were no ruins, and no\nPalestinians, and not even a trace\nof willingness by the 'imported'\ninhabitants of my village to\nwelcome under the will of peace.\nInstead I was asked to leave the\nvillage by an 'Ethiopian' Jew,\nwhose agony and the Jewish will\nimproved his knowledge of\ngeography and encouraged him to move to Palestine. He and\nothers could not accept my visit,\nwhich reminded them that this\nland is not theirs. Nevertheless,\nmy great-great-grandchild will\none day make the same journey.\nDespite these bitter experiences, I was honoured to see\nsome bright figures in Jerusalem,\nGaza, the West Bank and Bir Zeit. Such figures are ready to\ntell the whole world that an\nimposed peace is a rejected one,\nand a peace dictated and tailored\nby the Israelis is not and will not\nbe just.\nThis should always be\nre me be red by the nation which\nsuffered Hitler's Holocaust, but\nnow shamelessly reflects (thr-ough some of its figures) horrifying acts of hypocrisy and\narrogance on the helpless\nPalestinians.\nViolence is always the\nresult of violence and supp-res sion. And any peace formula\nimposed at the expense of the\nPalestinians will leave the Israelis\nwith harder questions to solve.\nS. Said am, Elec. Eng.

    "content": "ELIX\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College Nol021 17FEB95 King's President U Turns on Minibus\nBY ANDREW SMITH Ghassan Karian, the prospective\nUniversity of London Union President, has this week\nconfessed that he knowingly misled both the Imperial College\nUnion President ( ICU) and\nFELIX. In a dramatic adm is sion, he acknowledged that his\ncategorical denial that the King's College Union minibus had been\ninvolved in the violent and\ndestructive attack on Imperial\nCollege was untrue. Ghassan has\nnow confirmed that he himself\nhanded over the keys of the\nminibus used in the raid.\nThe remarks concern events\non Saturday February 4th when a group of 14 students from King's College entered the ICU building\nand caused an estimated \u00a32000\nworth of damage. When interviewed by FELIX after the\nattack, Mr Karian, the President\nof King's College Student Union,\ninsisted that he had been in possession of the minibus' keys\nduring the incident. In a letter to\nLucy Chothia, ICU President,\nlast Friday, Ghassan apologised\nfor the \"collective decision to\ncover the fact that our minibus\nwas used\".\nSpeaking to FELIX following the publication of this letter,\nGhassan confessed that he had\nknowingly and deliberately given\nfalse information to both ICU and FELIX concerning the\nincident. He conceded that he\nhad personally handed over the\nkeys to the group, knowing that\nthey were planning to travel en\nmasse to Imperial College.\nAfter admitting that the he\nhad knowingly misled FELIX about the minibus, Ghassan\ndenied that he had lied\npersonally, suggesting that he\nwas 'following a line'. Possibly\nwith a view to the UL U election\nearly next month, the King's President stressed that each of\nthe four members of the King's Sabbatical team had agreed with\nthe 'collective decision' to cover\nup this detail of the incident.\nUnder pressure the budding\nLabour politician and current\n(continues on page two)\nNUS Motion Fails - No Referendum\nBY ANDREW TSENG, NEWS EDITOR Imperial students were this week\ndenied the opportunity to vote on\njoining the National Union of\nStudents (NUS).\nA motion calling for a college wide referendum on\naffiliation to the NUS was\nnarrowly defeated on technicalities at Monday's meeting of\nImperial College Union's( ICU)\nCouncil.\nProposed by Lucy Chothia,\nICU President, and seconded by\nIan Parish, ICU Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies), the\nmotion would have given ICU its\nfirst college wide ballot on\naffiliation to the NUS in almost\ntwenty years. In 1977, the anti-NUS campaign won by five votes\nafter 1584 were cast, taking ICU out of the national student body.\nAt Monday's Council meeting, although those present\nagreed with the calling of a referendum, there was concern\nthat referendum campaigns\nwould clash with the sabbatical\nelection campaigns. Members\nsuggested that this might result\nin sabbaticals being elected simply on whether they\nwere pro- or anti-NUS.\nThe recently passed constitution lays down strict rules on\nreferendum procedures. Once\nCouncil or a petition of 200 ICU members has decided to hold a referendum, notice of the\nreferendum must be given within\ntwo college days and the campus\nwide ballot held twenty to\ntwenty-five days later. With voting usually taking place on a Monday or Tuesday, the ballot\nwould have taken place the week\nafter the sabbatical elections or\nduring the last week of term.\nThough MsC hot hi a was\nobviously disappointed that the\nmotion was not passed, Council\nis understood to favour a college\nwide referendum.\nThe motion is expected to be\nre-proposed at the next meeting\nof Council which takes place in a month.\n\u2022 news one&two&three \u2022 editorial&credits three \u2022 cat&mouse four \u2022 incoming five \u2022 s files:\nthe science of coffee seven \u2022 clued up eight \u2022 back chat: freezer geezer nine \u2022 feature:\nnatural born film aker eleven \u2022 feature: car wars in the twenty first century twelve&thirteen\n\u2022 xtra curricular fourteen&fifteen&sixteen&seventeen \u2022 standby: shaw shank redemption\neighteen&nineteen&twenty \u2022 eight day guide: life guide twenty two& twenty three \u2022 sport twenty four H "

    "content": "Xtra Curricular Feature\nChaos: Is this the mind-mess that could end your happy days?\nWhat is stress?\nIt is practically impossible to live a life without any stress in a world where stress thrives.\nA certain amount is good for us, since without it we would not have any motivation to\ndo anything. We would just want to lie down\nand enjoy being alive. Stress consists of the\nvarious pressures in our everyday existence.\nIn our pursuit of needs, such as food,\nsecurity, comfort, love, friendship and success we encounter various stresses.\nFrustration of our basic needs gives us stress.\nThe death of people close to us, moving to a new place to live, relationship difficulties,\nexam pressure and unemployment are high\nrisk factors. The times when we are most in\ndanger of stress is when we have several different stressful aspects in our life at one time.\nIt will be a struggle to cope with everything at\nonce, e.g. exam pressures and relationship\nproblems at the same time.\nThe trouble is that often we do not\nrealise that we are under stress and just try to\ncarry on surviving as usual. We might find\nthat we are doing more of the things which\nwe feel help us to relax, such as eating choco-late, smoking, drinking alcohol or coffee. We\nmight even find that we worry a lot and do\nnot feel able to cope with the littlest of things.\nThe pressures of being a student?\nThere are many stresses which students face.\nStudent life, for most people, involves being\naway from home for the first time which can\nbe traumatic, especially if it involves adjusting to a new culture and system. Managing\neveryday responsibilities, such as living on af FELIX I1FEB95\nlow income, dealing with the landlord or\nlandlady, boring lectures, know-it-all col-leagues, travel, bad weather and making decisions can be stressful. Student life offers\nmany opportunities for experimentation\nwhich can create anxieties. Additionally, students are expected to do a lot of work and\nmay leave it to the last minute which can\nresult in the crisis of having to stay up all\nnight working to meet deadlines. All in all, it\nis likely that if you are a student you are\nunder stress.\nThe effects of stress\nHealth experts have identified the effect of\nstress in illnesses such as cancer, heart trouble and blood pressure problems. Stress can\nlead to physical symptoms such as headaches\nand stomach pains. In many cases, it leads to\nfeelings of sadness, fatigue and insomnia\nwhich in the extreme can amount to de pre s sion.\nStress can cause people to make mistakes\nand to develop addictions in the search for\ncomfort and relaxation. Smoking, taking\ndrugs and alcohol abuse are often related to\nstress.\nWhat can you do?\nBefore you rush for a cigarette or drink, try\nthe following:\n1 Recognise stress symptoms e.g. feelings of\nnot being able to cope. Acceptance of stress is\nimportant. If you admit to yourself that you\nare stressed, it will help as you can then look\nat ways of dealing with it. Remember, if you\nCould you be under stress?\nKeys: Pillow, Aromatherapy, Exams\nget stuck or don't know what to do, speak to\nsomeone ('a problem shared...').\n2 Relaxation may help. There are a number\nof ways of relaxing. Techniques, include creative visualisation, The Alexander\nTechnique, meditation and aromatherapy.\nThere are also herbal medicines which can\nhelp you to relax, although it is worth trying\nto find out about any possible side-effects\nfirst.\n3 Talking to friends can help but sometimes\nprofessional counselling is required. See the\nlist of useful organisations. There is nothing\nto be ashamed about having counselling.\n4 If you get stressed because there are too\nmany demands on you, learn to prior it is e. If\nyou are taking exams you may need to plan\nyour time so that you can get all the important things done first (and this does not mean\nthat you cannot have any time for enjoy-ment). Consider what needs to be done first,\norganise your work to meet deadlines. Speak\nto your department if you need help with\nyour work.\n5 Laugh at things, as laughter produces a good biochemical reaction and so does smil-ing. Crying is also a good way of releasing\ntension and stress.\n6 Shout (but not in a crowded lecture room).\n7 Hit your pillow.\n8 Sport is good as it releases frustration and\nin addition is good for general well being.\n9 Listen to music. Certain types of music is\nrelaxing. Dancing can also release tensions\nthat have built up.\n10 Be assertive, tell people what you think\n(but be careful!). Don't let things build up. If\nsomeone or something is making you un hap py, challenge it head on.\n11 A healthy diet can help.\n12 Write down how you feel. Emphasise\nyour good points and recognise your weak\npoints.

    "content": "Standby\n^ worthy\nFor all the gaping faults of the\nHollywood system there's one thing\nit tends to do well - feelgood by ]\nnumber films. It's a category that\nfits the shaw shank redemption\nlike a granny knitted mitten.\nThe cliques are present right\nfrom the start onwards. Andy\nDufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongly\nconvicted of killing his wife and her\nlover and sent to Shawshank prison\nto serve two life terms. Inside he\nmeets Red (Morgan Freeman) and\nthere the plot remains for ninety\nminutes of the film's two hours. We\nget to learn (once again) about the\nquirks of prison life - how fixers can\nget whatever you want, how screws\nare sadists who beat people up,\nhow the warden is a power crazed\nmaniac who says \"there'll be no\nblasphemy in my prison\", whilst\ntaking oily back-handers ... It's nothing new and if the plot was the\nonly focus of our gaze, most of\nShawshank would be boring.\nHowever it's only supposed to\nbe a backdrop to the \"unlikely\nfriendship\" that strikes up between\nthe two inmates. It certainly is\nunlikely. Red is one of the few\ncoloured men inside (surely a statistical mistake even in the\n1950s) whilst Andy is a banker who\nlikes collecting rocks. In fact the\nonly reason the film works is\nbecause both Robbins and Freeman\nare good enough to carry the\nconcept. The audience can just\nbelieve in them and let pass all the\nhomilies about prison being some\nsort of benign holiday camp,\ndespite its percentage of\nmurderers.\nThe director's uncertainty in\ntrying to depict a realistic prison\nenvironment is perhaps best seen\nwith its depiction of the inmate's sexual activity. Under the co sh of\npolitical correctness these lines\ngrace the screen: \"I guess it\nwouldn't do any good to tell them\nI'm not homosexual\" says Andy.\n\"They're not homosexual\" says Red,\n\"you have to be human for that\" -pass the sick bag or was that an\nOscar?\nAs his sentence slowly passes,\nyou can tell by the nominal flecks\nof grey in Andy's hair, the\nunderlying thrust of the film\nbecomes clear. Red is the\npragmatist who lives day to day,\nwhilst slowly becoming\ninstitutional is ed whilst Andy, the\neducated and innocent liberal\nalways retains his hope in\nhumanity, his innocence and the\nthe shaw shank redemption\na men can way.\nAs should be clear, the\nShawshank Redemption is a worthy\nfilm, which perhaps for that reason\nsits rather uncomfortably within the\nmodern cynical world of cinema.\nIt's not a bad film and I suppose\nthat many will enjoy its slow grace\nbut to paraphrase a modern\nphilosopher, 'it's like a milky way -light and you can eat it between\nmeals without ruining your\nappetite\".\nIn far from home: the\nadventures of yellow dog, we\nsee a world that only exists in the\nminds of Twentieth Century Fox\nexecutives. It is a dreamy, Wonder\nYears place, where fourteen year\nold boys aren't interested in\nNintendos, drugs and oral sex, but\nrather get kicks out of owning a dog and going off for slightly\ndangerous boat rides with their\ndads. Our dad, incidentally, is that\nguy who plays the father in the TV\nshow Harry and the Hendersons,\nand mom is Mimi Rogers, first wife\nof Tom Cruise and twice winner of\nmost wooden actress in a sub-Meryl Streep role.\nSet in Canada, presumably in\nthe present (though if it wasn't for a couple of helicopters it could have\nbeen anytime after about 1950)\nour hero, Angus McCormick is a happy and healthy 14 year old boy,\nwho loves his family very much.\nUnlike 57% of 14 year olds, he has\nnever indulged in oral sex, though\nhe does get to kiss a girl towards\nthe final half of the film, but that is\nafter his dog is missing, presumed\ndead. For the dog, a stray labrador\nhe creatively names Yellow, is the\nlove of young Angus' life.\nAt its heart, this is a survival\nstory, and there are some\nacceptably engaging moments,\nthough one can't get over the\nfeeling that was enthusiastically\npitched to the studio as 'Alive\nmeets Lassie'. The kid is just as cute\nand American and vomit o us as one\nwould expect, but at least we are\nready for that. What one cannot\nprepare oneself for is how long\nthey manage to make an eighty\nminute film seem ... I felt like I had\nbeen stuck in the wilderness for 18\ndays by the end of it all. Only when\nhe had to start eating insects and\ncute little bunny rabbits was my\ninterest engaged, but alas even\nthat became tedious. What more is\nthere to say except that the movie\nwas spoiled by the number of\nscreaming incontinent kids in the\naudience. Q^ aces in holes\nSo did you find your true love on Tuesday? If you did\nand want to celebrate, or if you failed miserably and\nare still looking, the local style and beauty will be in\nFulham on Saturday for a love lick. Another\nproduction from the capable minds of IQ,\nexpectations of excellence are rife. Having sampled\ntheir quality before, this is one of those evenings you\ncan turn up at secure in the fact that the dressed up\ncrowd will be relaxed, the door policy friendly and\nthe music among the best. Picking an unusual spot,\nin my opinion they've scored highly ... from the\ngeneral decor to the aquarium under the bar,\nBon/our Vietnam simply oozes style. The Venus room\nwill be Swinging with HipHop, funk and rag ga licks,\nwhile the Cupid room drops passionate garage and\nsoulful house. This is a one-off special you'd be mad\nto miss.\nA new night has come to bring relief to funk-lovers around the capital. If, like me, you're fed up\nof the flyers saying 'Funk' that when you get there\ntranslates into 'Swingandhiphop' get yourself to\nBrown Sugar as fast as possible and rejoice in the\nsmoothest groove to move you into Mondays that\nhas ever been. This is set to become my local, and\nthe hours in between will seem hard. The jazzy notes\nare amplified and added to by the resident\nsaxophonist, while the talent on the bongos sets the\ntempo for the dancing. Food is available 'til 10pm( \u00a35 for a main) and shortly afterwards the vibe\nmoves up and the party begins. The first night\nattracted some of the cream of the area's stylish\ncrowd - and you can be certain that they'll all be\ngoing back. On the whole it looks like the quality is\nmoving West\na love lick@ Bon/our Vietnam, 593-595 Fulham\nRoad, will be doing it from 10 until 6 for \u00a37.\nbrown sugar is at the Canal Brasserie, 222\nKensal Road, W10.

    "content": "News and Editorial\nNews In\nBrief\nBY RACHEL WALTERS, JOHN SINNER AND ANDREW TSENG Pratchett Illustrator Visits IC\nJosh Kirby, science fiction and\nfantasy illustrator, presented a number of slides on his work at\nthe Haldane library on\nWednesday.\nJosh Kirby is probably best\nknown for his illustrations of\nTerry Pratchett's hugely\nsuccessful humourous novels.\nThe work presented consisted\nmostly of his covers for the\nfantasy author. He said that he\nliked working with Terry Pratchett and that they have\ndeveloped an 'exceptional'\nrelationship through their work.\nHe has also illustrated a number\nof books that have imitated\nPratchett's style in the wake of\nthe Discworld novels, but\nadmitted that, although they\nwere 'good fun to illustrate',\nsome are 'appa ling to read'.\nBesides his more recent\nwork, he presented a selection of\nhis older works, including other\nnovel illustrations. Josh Kirby has been illustrating professionally for more than 20 years.\nHe chronicled the striking development of the paintings as\nthey have developed into the\nunmistakable, helter-skelter style\nthat we recognise today.\nTory Blunder\nImperial College Conservatives\nhave snubbed yet another\nprominent Tory MP. Teresa\nGorman, a prominent euro-sce pti c, was left to wander\naround Imperial College last\nWednesday after no one turned\nup to greet her.\nShe was expecting to address\na meeting of the Conservative\nSociety, who had asked her to\nspeak on the subject of Europe.\nHowever, in what has been seen\nas an act of sheer ineptitude, the\nConservative Society was\nunaware of her visit. Speaking to\nFELIX shortly after Mrs Gorman left, Ian Bayley,\nChairman of the Conservative\nSociety was horrified at the\nblunder. \"There has been a dreadful misunderstanding,\" he\nannounced.\nJill Brown, Secretary to Mrs\nGorman, was angered by the\nincompetence of the Conservative Society. She also\nannounced that Mrs Gorman was\nfurious and would not be\nreturning to Imperial College.\n\"We will be billing the\nConservative Society, for Mrs Gorman's Taxi fare to Imperial\",\nshe added.\nIn an attempt to limit the\ndamage, Mr Bayley, issued a statement on behalf of the\nConservative Society. He defended the society declaring\nthat 'we would like to apologise\nto ICU for any embarrassment\ncaused. The incident was caused\nby a breakdown in communication with Mrs Gorman's Private Office'.\nOn Yer Bike\nThe Royal Borough of\nKensington and Chelsea have\nlaunched a scheme to increase\nthe number of local cycle routes.\nThey have produced a consultation leaflet suggesting a range of possible paths for\ncyclists throughout the borough.\nNew routes could be enforced\nalong Old Brompton and Fulham\nRoads, and up Exhibition Road\nfrom South Kensington Station\nto Hyde Park.\nAlex Reed, Director of\nHighways and traffic, has said\nthat they are anxious to get\nfeedback from Imperial students.\nThe leaflet is designed as part of\nan ongoing consultation process,\nbut he explained that they are\ncompiling their initial report in\nMarch, and would like responses\nas soon as possible. A number of\noptions are available, but he\nindicated that the most favoured\nsolution was to introduce\n'advisory' cycle lanes. Mandatory\nbike-only routes seem to be a less\nlikely option. Leaflets are\navailable from the union office.\nElection\nWatch\nBY ANDREW TSENG Jrjggg||ifr With only a few\nfM% \u2022 \u00ab hours left until^ \u2022 D^o* papers come down, a plethora of candidates have declared themselves.\nOnly Rachel Walters, standing\nfor the post of FELIX Editor\nand Print Unit Manager, is\nuncontested as FELIX went to\npress.\nLast week's Presidential\nspeculation has been proved\naccurate, with both Miles\nAmbler and Sarah White battling Kevin Ward for the post.\nAn uncontested battle has\nalso turned into a three horse\nrace in the contest for Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies).\nJoining Maryam Yahyani is\nLuke Gietzen and Tim Townend.\nHowever, there has been no\nchange in the Deputy President\n(Finance & Services) contest,\nonly Matthew Crompton and\nAnnie Matthewman are\npresently standing, although\nSimon Govier, is still believed to\nbe eyeing up the post.\nPapers come down at 5pm today.

The spurious\nquoting of random artists is no\ndifferent to somebody claiming\nknowledge of science via a coffee\ntable book on Hawking or\nEinstein. Just because you have\nheard of Dali and seen some\npostcards, doesn't mean that you\nunderstand his work, his\nmotivation, his context in the\nhistory of art etc. Scientists see\nthese as irrelevancies. Looking\nfor formulas and rules and\nfinding none they assume -not\nthat they have a lack of\nunderstanding of the artist - but\nthat they know all there is to\nknow about him.\nAs scientists, we are all aware\nthat there is more to the science\nof robotics than Robocop or to\nblack holes than 'wormholes in\ntime'. But that is just the attitude\nwe take towards art. We judge\nharshly science as portrayed in\npopular culture and yet we apply\nthe same wayward thinking to\nfields other than our own.\nOf course there is a basic\naesthetic beauty to a painting that\ncan be comprehended regardless\nof knowledge of art or the artist.\nBut one should realise that this\nexperience is ultimately no more\nrepresentative of an understanding of art then, say, taking a bus to college is to mechanical\nengineering.\nGet Into Gear\nFor the last ten years I 've argued\nwith people about cars. I think\nthat the scheme proposed in Lisa\nRajan's article is the first that can\ncounteract both the 'what about\nbringing a lot of shopping home?'\nand the 'but driving is so much\nfun' arguments. It doesn't combat\nthe 'I wanna big bad Jag to piss\nall over the neighbour's Volvo'\nline of reasoning but people have\nto realise that things are\nchanging. The law of the road is\nunder review - why not adopt\nthese schemes and go find a new\nphallic symbol to thrust about in.\nMay I suggest an enormous\nbanana hat?\nElections Special\nSabbatical manifestoes in full\nnext week, together with gossip\nand a1994 campaign diary!\nCredits\nEditor\nPrinter\nBusiness Manager\nAdvertising Manager\nEditorial Team\nOwain Bennallack\nAndy Thompson\nTim Bovister\nHelen Randall\nArt & Literature\nCinema\nClubs, Societies & Union\nColumns\nFeatures\nLayout and Design\nMusic\nNews Andrew\nPhotography Ivan\nPuzzles\nS Flles\nEight Day Guide\nSport Juliette\nStandby\nTheatre\nEditorial Assistance\nJon Jordan\nWei Lee\nPiers Daniell\nMarcus Alexander\nKate Cox\nMr Paul Dias\nVik Bansal\nTseng & Rachel Walters\nChan & Diana Harrison\nTim St Clare\nThe Team\nJeremy Thomson\nDecock and Mark Baker\nJon Jordan\nJoseph Barr\nCollating Last Week\nTyping\nHelpfulness\nAndrew Tseng,Jon\nJordan & Helen Randall\nSteven Se\nMichael Chamberlain\nI1P GB95 FELIX "

People\npolarised very quickly into\nthose who loved ^coffee, who frequented\nthe many ^coffee houses of\nLondon, and the traders and\npublicans who hated it, describing the smell of roasting\n^ coffee in terms of \"syrup\nand soot\" and \"essence of old\nshoes\".\nThe habit of chewing\n^ coffee beans and fermenting the red ^coffee fruits\n- which are known as\n^coffee cherries - into wine,\nhad begun in Ethiopia ten\ncenturies earlier. The word\n^ coffee is thought to\noriginate either from an\nEthiopian town called Kaffa,\nor from an Arabic word\nqa hwa h, meaning wine.\nSince then, ^coffee has\ndone more than enter the\nEnglish language.
