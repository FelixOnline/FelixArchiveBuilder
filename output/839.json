    "content": "Annual Reports\nRCC Chairman\nThis year has been a typical one for the RCC. Essentially the clubs have been doing their own thing\nas usual, whilst the Committee has been giving out the money. Here are a few highlights.\nThe year started with the formation of the Remote-Controlled Model Club. Aided by a generous\nstart-up grant from the RCC this club appears to be doing very well, and I have a lot of respect\nfor Guy Myer for setting up a club having been at College less than a term. The RCC is in the\nprocess of accepting the start up of Splot Soc, to cater for the growing band of people who want\nto shoot each other in the woods. Funny, but it seems to be those in the TA who have most to\nsay against other people playing soldiers. On the debit side we appear to have lost the Chess, Chinese\nChess and Waterski Clubs, but I hope that this is only temporary.\nIt seems unfair to mention the successes of individual clubs, as there will always be those which\nI don't know about. This being the case I won't criticise either. Suffice to say that the only complaint\nI have about clubs are that they can be a little too self-contained. It is obvious that in many cases\nclubs are running themselves quite happily, and don't want to be bothered with any Union business,\nsuch as insurance, reports, grants...\nThe subject of the Union brings me on to the hack bit. I bacame involved with the Union only\nin my capacity as RCC Chairman, having had very little contact with the administrative side of\nthings previously. At first I was appalled by the lack of standardisation in the way that things are\ndone. I can see why each year the sabbaticals spend so much time trying to sort things out. However,\nover the course of the year I have come to be a lot less worried about this. I sincerely believe that\nthe Union's job is to look after the Vel fare of students by, as the Union Finance Committee put\nit, 'laundering Government money'. The issue of club bank accounts is a good illustration of this\nprinciple. The only people in the Union vy ho want bank accounts are the Major Sub-Committee\nChairs, because they know that the a counts would make life a lot easier for their clubs. Everyone\nelse sees it as an administrative nightmare, with reduced control over what clubs can spend their\nmoney on. But this is not what the Union is here for. If we can get away with handing clubs a cheque at the beginning of the year and saj i ing, 'be good with it,' then we should. I know we\ncan't, but we should be aiming for as much autonomy as we can manage. The CCUs get away\nwith it. I am very pleased that Tom Yates has persuaded a UGM to make Council see sense, as\ntheir baha vi our on this topic I regard as dishonour able. Ah well, rant over. It's been a good year for me, as doing this job has brought me into contact\nwith many interesting people. I'd like to thank those people in the RCC and the Union who made\nit all possible, my parents, girlfriend...Good luck to my successor, Tim King, and to everyone for\nnext year.\nDuncan McGregor,\nRCC Chairman 1988/89.\nPGAO\nIntroduction\nThe PGAO's job is to represent to the Union and College the views of almost half the membership\nof this college, the PhD, MSc and other postgraduate students. Since this group is notoriously silent,\nthe job is rendered more difficult, and trying to elicit views from the PG community is next to\nimpossible. Just trying to get the PG Group to meet has proved very difficult as well! Over the\nsummer of '88, several PG Group meetings were called, and the attendance at these was 4 (including\nmyself and the Union President). As a result of this, I decided that the PGAO's job for this year\nshould be two-fold: firstly to represent the views and interests of PGs, as I saw them, and secondly\nto advertise the Union and College facilities to postgraduates. These will be the two underlying\nthemes in the rest of this report.\nCollege Committees\nThe two College committees that the PGAO sits on are the Board of Studies (BoS) and the Graduate\nStudies Committee (GSC). BoS is essentially a rubber stamping body for other committees, though\nin theory is the supreme academic body. As such little of interest to PGs goes on here which doesn't happen first in GSC. GSC oversees all the PG teaching offered by the College. Regular work includes\nvetting new MSc course and changes in existing ones; there has been no trouble in this area, though\nI would draw your attention to the number of Europe-related MSc's starting up as/we draw closer\nto 1992. However, the issue of qualifications for European students who study rare for a year at\nMSc level has caused a lot of discussion. The argument of whether they should be awarded MSc's, DIC's, or nothing has been resolved by the intro duct in of a new qualification, the International\nDiploma of Imperial College (IDIC). Divising this award took many meetings of a working party\nof which I was a member.\nAnother continuing issue this year was that of quality of supervision of foreign PhD students,\nthey pay considerably greater fees than home students, and seem not to benefit a great deal from\nthem. Indeed IC's reputation in two countries, Brazil and Turkey, has been severely damaged by\ncomments sent back to their home governments about poor supervision. They have the impression\nthat IC only wants them for their money, and is not prepared to do much for it! Indeed, the Rector\ngives this very impression at the Overseas Students Reception each year. From the problems reported\nand this impression it is small wonder that we will be getting far fewer students from these two\ncountries in future. However, it is my belief that the supervision problems faced by these overseas\nstudents are not isolated, or indeed confined to foreign students. My own experience in my research\ngroup would tend to confirm this, but the College-wide picture is very unclear, partly due to the\ntotal lack of communication between PGs and either College or the Union about supervisory\nproblems. Tutors, advisers and PG reps exist in every department, but these facilities are not widely\nknown or advertised beyond the initial introductions and leaflets that are probably lost by the time\nproblems arise. The end result of this is reduced submission rates, and a poorer rep u ation for the\nwhole College. Some statistics MUST be gathered about this, and I would suggest that my successor\nlooks into possible schemes.\nPG Committees\nOne of the initiatives I took this year was to liaise with the Physics PG rep to try to set up a PG\nstaff-student committee. However, it was never clear what the terms of reference of this group\nwould be, or how it would function. In principle it would be a good way of getting information\non the overall level of PG lecturing and supervision, but would be unable to do anything about\nit. As such, it did not seem reasonable to create a toothless monster, and the plans have died away.\nI now believe that schemes like this are not the best way of proceeding with PG representation,\nbut am at a loss as to what is.\nDemonstrators Pay Rates\nA major success of the year has been spotting that College did not increase the PG demonstrators\npay rates in line with UGC recommendations at the start of the academic session, and getting them\nto implement the increase in the s uw mer term. Since the pay rates are examined before October,\nCollege has effectively missed paying two terms worth of the increase. They MUST NOT be allowed\nto get away with this again! My successor should watch College like a hawk on this at the start\nof the session, and compare demonstrators pay rates at IC with those elsewhere. My heartfelt thanks\nto Isobel Fairclough for running this one to earth.\nPGs and the Union\nPostgraduates have been the silent voice in Union affairs for many years. In some ways this is not\nsurprising, as they need to work long hours, have no formal timetables, and do not communicate\nmuch with UGs. Indeed individual research groups seldom communicate much! The Union is seen\nby most as a purely UG preserve, with little or nothing, aside from the clubs, to offer a PG. To\nactually make the PGs aware of what the Union does, 1CU must get them into the building and\nadvertise its facilities. To this end, and on limited funds, a PG reception was arranged for all\npostgraduates in the Christmas term. An invitation was also sent to all PGs which also outlined\nwhat the Union does for its postgraduate students. The response from the PGs was overwhelming,\nwith a vast turnout. Theresponsefrom IC Union was pitiful. Only one non-PG Union Officer decided\nhe should help (and many thanks for that assistance Chas). With this degree of enthusiasm for\nadvertising ICU to the Postgraduates, is it surprising that hardly any of them are interested? It\nis time that the Union realised that if it wants postgraduates to be interested in it, THEN ICU MUST\nBE INTERESTED IN POSTGRADUATES! This is the single most important lesson I would impart\nto my successor\u2014that the Union must not be just as apathetic about PGs as they are about the Union.\nConclusion\nIn many ways this year has been a starting point. One of the tasks 1 set myself when I took the\njob was to get more PGs interested in the Union. Over the year I have made some faltering steps\nin this direction, but have also seen the true magnitude of this problem, and that it exists both\nsides of the fence. What little has been done this year to make a start MUST be continued next\nyear, and I wish Martin Cans, next year's PGAO, the best of luck. I'd also like to thank Tom, Yishu\nand Isobel for their help over the year, and Gareth Fish for getting me interested in the job.\n'It was a tough job, but somebody had to do it'\nSuperChicken\nEnts Chairman\nDear FELIX,\nWeather is great and the water's lovely,\nDue to Ent's success this year with Freshers' Week, smaller events (such as Jesus /ones, Brilliant\nCorners) and two sell out Carnivals, I have been able to buy this luxury yacht in the Mediterranean,\nand enough beer to drown the entire Ents crew. Thanks to everybody whose worked hard this\nyear to put everything on, and good luck to BJ for next year.\nWotty.\nPub Board Chairman\nOverview\nAs I have only been Chairman of the board since late January, I am only able to comment on its\nactivities since then. When I started the job, I was faced with a large amount of administrative\nwork that needed sorting, however, I managed to sort everything out, and I think that on the whole,\nnothing has gone wrong. 1 am extremely grateful for the help given by Robert Gimeno (Junior\nTreasurer) and the Union Finance Officer, in keeping our accounts up to date.\nImperial College Radio\nImperial College Radio has, this year, succeeded well in its campaign to broadcast on FM, thanks\nto the hard work of Nigel Whitfield, the Station Manager. A trial transmitting system has been\nin use until May this year, when the test and development licence expired. I hope that their\nsubsequent application for an operating licence is successful, and that the Union will be prepared\nto fund this new venture. The other major improvement that has been made, is to their studio\nunder Garden Hall.'This has been re-plastered by College\u2014the old walls were very damp\u2014and\nIC Radio were able to purchase a new sound mixer from money donated by the Queen's Gate\nTrust. A lot of extra money has also been spent on this room, and it now serves the purpose as\nIC Radio's main office.\nSTOIC\nSTOIC, despite its problems with break-ins and insurance, they have provided an excellent service\nduring the spring term, with five programmes a week\u2014the largest number ever! The time and money\nspent on the studio over the last few years would at last appear to have paid off, and I hope that\nthe quantity and quality of programmes can be maintained for next year.\nFELIX\nThis year's FELIX has occassionally disappointed me, with its lack of size, although, what has been\nproduced has been of excellent quality. FELIX, unlike most other clubs and societies, does not have\na Five Year Plan, but has an equipment replacement fund. This year its terms have been altered\nto allow purchase of equipment other than just the Litho and Typesetter. A new folding machine\nis being purchased from the fund, to replace the worn out one currently in use. This should mean\nthat future copies of FELIX will always be correctly folded. FELIX have managed to cope with\nequipment breaking down regularly, especially the Litho, which has been repaired at least twice\nthis year.\nOther Publications\nThis year's Alternative Prospectus had just arrived from the printers when I wrote this, and my\nfirst impression of it was excellent. Ramin Nakisa has done a great job editting it, and the cover\nis one of the best I have seen. The Handbook for new students, is currently being edited by Steve\nMeyfroidt, and will be ready during the summer, for distribution.\nI would like to wish all of the publications well in their activities next year, and hope that my\nsuccessor has an enjoyable time.\nJonathan Denham,\nPublications Board Chairman 1988-89\n\n"

    "content": "News Feature\nAnother branch of Imperial\nImperial college acquired Silwood\nPark in 1947 to replace the original\nmuch smaller field station in Slough. Other than the Reactor\nCentre which was purpose built, the\nBiology Department at Silwood was\noperated on a 'split site' basis in Silwood House, Ashurst Lodge and\nodd outbuildings including the Shell\nBuilding built in 1988.\nAbout five years ago, following\nmajor UGC grant cuts, the College\ndecided that if operations at Silwood\nwere to continue then the site would\nhave to pay for itself insofar as was\npossible. Therefore the Science Park\nwas built with the Technology\nTransfer Centre where small\ncompanies develop new products\noften in collaboration with College\ndepartments.\nAlso on site is the UK headquarters of the Commonwealth\nAgricultural Bureaux Institute of\nBiological Control which has a joint\nlibrary facility with the Biology\nDepartment. This library is situated\nin the CAB building and is a major\nasset to students and staff at\nSilwood housing the old Silwood,\nand Ashurst libraries and the\nCommonwealth Entomological\nLibrary that was previously located\nin Queensgate London. CAB has\nfacilities on-site for the importation,\nscreening and breeding of\npathogens and parasitoids under\nquarantine conditions for use as\nbiological control agents. The new\nbiology blocks were built with the\nproceeds from the sale of Ashurst\nLodge and four associated acres of\nland.\nSilwood has about thirty academic\nstaff, eighty\\rton-academic staff and\nabout ninety postgraduate students.\nIt is used for field courses by the\nbiology and engineering\ndepartments and also by other\ncolleges, eg the intercollegiate\nLondon University Field Course in\nParasitology.\nThe last open day at Silwood was\nin 1972. The aim of this open day\nwas to show local inhabitants, local\nsh cools, people from industry and\nthe research council's academics\nfrom other universities and academic and administrative staff at\nImperial the new buildings at\nSilwood and the work currently\nbeing conducted here.\nMike Hassell FRS Director of\nSilwood Park believes that the\nfuture for operations at Silwood is\nextremely good. Work should start\nthis autumn on the building of the\nInterdisciplinary Centre in Population Biology and this with\ncurrent work already conducted at\nSilwood will make it the world's premier centre for ecological\nresearch.\nMany thanks to Mike Hassell FRS\nfor his help\nHOCKEY\nImperial spirit\nlives on\nThis Easter members of the Imperial\nCollege Hockey Club Men's XI\ncompeted in the Folkstone\nInternational Hockey Festival.\nWearing T shirts kindly donated by\nVladivar Vodka bearing the motto\n\"The Imperial Spirit Lives' the team\nhad a difficult start losing to\nEdinburgh University Old Boys.\nCentreforward Paul Skipworth\nslid out of the tournament, breaking\nhis leg in a particularly fierce tackle\nand before IC played the traditional\ngrudge match against the 'Windy.\nMillers', IC Old Boys side, losing 1-0\nin a tight match.

The requirements of the fleet nave beer, analysed to find out whether the purchase\nof a car, a van with a tow bar( ie exit door on the side) and a minibus (with comfy seats as opposed\nto the crew buses we have at present).\nWe do not have the money in the transport account to purchase a new van as two were purchased\nlast year. It may be possible, however, to buy a second-hand or reconditioned van to replace our\noldest seventeen seater.\nPublicity\nThe recent appearance of the Moonies on campus highlights the importance of enforcing the Union's publicity rules which cover the Union Building, Southside Lounge and the Sherfield Walkway.\nThe publicity rules were changed this year to facilitate easier enforcement and Rag have done\nposter raids collecting those which contravened the rules. The first one gave rise to fines totalling\n\u00a385 (which, at between 5p and 20p average a fine, is significant).\nA new rule was introduced later on in the year as a result of the Socialist Worker Student Society\ntrying to make an external poster valid by writing ICUSWSS in bir o at the top.\nAll in all the Union's clubs and societies have begun to follow the rules and the greatest problem\nlies with external bodies and College publicity.\nReturning Officer\nApart from the sabbatical elections, the job of Returning Officer has been reasonably uneventful\nwith many posts still remaining unfilled.\nDuring the sabbatical elections, hustings were held at St Mary's, Fisher Hall and Montpellier\nHalls as well as in the Great Hall.\nI would recommend that no hustings take place at St Mary's until the merger is settled and the\nstudents there realise the importance of the sabbatical elections. As it was, it was a disgrace. During\nthe vote it became apparent that the St Mary's exec were 'encouraging' people to vote in a certain\nway and Elections Committee decided that the votes cast at St Mary's should not be considered.\nAn appeal was then made to the Executive Committee by one of the candidates but the decision\nwas upheld. The situation then went to appear at UGM (by now, the count had been delayed by\ntwo days) which voted to uphold the decision by 131 votes to 97.\nThe said votes were destroyed and the count took place returning Neil McClusky as President,\nDave Williams as Deputy President, Fiona Nicholas as Honorary Secretary, and Dave Smedley\nas FELIX Editor.\nAround nine hundred people voted and the single trans f enable vote system was used.\nPhotocopying\nThis year I have issued enough photocopy cards for over fifty thousand A4 copies to be done on\nthe Union Office photocopier.\nThe mah cine has been frequently out of order but this is probably due to the excessive use rather\nthan a faulty machine. In any case, my predecessor organised the contract which only allows us\nto change the model in two years time.\nAt present, clubs and societies are given a plastic copy card for which they are invoiced during\nthe summer term. A better system would be for cards similar to those used in the departments\nto be sold through the bookstore and the money to be claimed back by the buyer from the club.\nThis would prevent people getting unnecessarily large numbers of units and would help the\ntreasurers to have a better idea of the club's creditors.\nThe Executive were criticised for their slow uptake on the issue before the White Paper had been\npublished. The argument was that we should have known what was happening from the\nnewspapers. Ask the same people about the march on November 25 and they say that the\nnewspapers were biased in their reporting.\nUponreadingthe White Paper, it was obvious that no consideration had been given to London\nas an exception to national averages.\n1 obtained a copy of the survey of undergraduates' income and expenditure which was the basis\nfor the White Paper and analysed the figures for London. The result was that students in London\nwill be \u00a31,500 overdrawn at the end of the course over and above the student loan they will still owe.\nThe paper from which that figure was derived was sent to every MP and replies are being received\ndaily.\nConclusions\nI have enjoyed the year on the whole and unlike the old clich e;,I would happily undertake to do\nthe job again because it is a pity that all the knowledge and contacts gained by a sabbatical walk\nout of the Union at the end of then1 term. There is of course the point that if you j \u00a3y peanuts you\nget monkeys.\nThis Union is run on goodwill and I thank everyone who has shown some this year.\nBy the way, I 've just set up this company\nIan Morris.\nDeputy President\nIt has been a year of much change within ICU. Not least with the radical change in the job which\nthe Deputy President has had to do. However, I have found myself spending much more time\non areas which I previously thought would not take up much time at all.\nChief among these areas is that of the general administration of the Union. I was surprised when\nI took up the job just how much work is required just to keep the Union \"ticking over\". For this\nreason I will have disappointed many people who voted for me in the hope that I could achieve\na great deal in some areas. Nevertheless, progress has been made in various fields which I will\ndeal with in more detail below.\n1. Academic Affairs\nThis is the single most important area that the Union deals with as I believe that the Union's interaction with the College's academic machinery can have the most wide-ranging implications\nfor the students. As Academic Affairs Officer last year, it made sense for me to continue representing\nstudents in this field.\n1. Committees: A horrible word, but it's the stuff that Academic Affairs thrives on. Whether at\nthe level of a1 st year Ac Rep or the DP himself, we all have a vital part t q play in making sure\nthat our courses run smoothly. This is not always easy, but by applying pressure in the appropriate\nCommittees it is possible to get the College to do something about academic problems.\n2. Undergraduate Studies Committee: This has been my second year on the Committee. The\nworkload which it has undertaken has been tremendous, and my thanks must go to Professor David\nBlow who has been Chairman for three years and has come to the end of his term of office. Through\nthe Committee he has done a hell of a fot for the students of this College. Professor David Ewins,\nwho has been responsible for the Lecturer Evaluation Questionnaire which was run throughout\nthe College, takes over as Chairman and I wish him well. Vernon McClure, the Deputy Registrar,\nhas put in a lot of work on the questionnaire and behind-the-scenes, and 1 hope he will continue\nhis work as Secretary of the Committee.\n3. Among the subjects which the Committee deals with are the evaluation of new and existing\ncourses, the lecturer questionnaire and has also had a working group on student needs. This has\nmeant lots of meeting for everybody (not least the student members) and a lot of hard work has\nbeen done this year in these areas. If there is a single Committee which has shown dedication to\nstudent's academic needs, then this is it.\n4. Lecturer Questionnaire: I was responsible for assisting the College with the pilot run last year\nand so I was part icu al rly pleased see it fully in operation this year. However, it has not been without\nproblems. Low returns and general apathy from Joe Student has provoked an angry backlash from\nmany staff, who are concerned that statistically dubious results will affect their promotion prospects.\nI can only counter this by saying that the questionnaire is but one of the areas which the USC\nhas identified as being suitable for assessing staff. It is up to YOU students to fill in the questionnaire\nand provide the College with YOUR assessment of your lecturers. If you do not do this, the more\nconservative elements among the staff may well try to have the questionnaire scrapped. Four years\nof hard work could go down the drain and the students will be back to square one.\nI urge all of you not to let this happen.\n5. Board of Studies: The top academic body in the College, chaired by the Rector, it is basically\na rubber-stamping Committee, nearly always in quo rate( because everything has already been\ndecided). The disadvantage of this is that it is very difficult to get them to change their ways. The\nadvantage is that a report from a Sub-Committee (nearly all of which have student reps on them)\nwill be accepted with virtually no dissent. This often means that the students' views, incorporated\ninto a policy document, will be accepted by the College and recommendations put into practice.\n6. Careers Advisers Committee: The Committee is virtually ineffective, the Departmental Careers\nAdvisors giving little input. The staff in the Careers Service are dedicated to their jobs and having\nworked with them at both College and University level 1 am very impressed with the work that\nthey do. But funding pressures mean that externally generated income is becoming a larger than\never proportion of the CAS budget (20% for next year in the University CAS). The IC CAS has\nhad its budget cut because of the College's expectation that they should raise funds from employers.\n7. At the University Level I have been a member of the University Careers Advisory Board which\nmeets twice a year. I think that I have been able to enhance the reputation of IC students with\nthe Board, being the only student rep out of all the others who has attended every meeting of the\nBoard and its Student Liason sub-committee. (Total: 4 meetings.) The Board is useful for gaining\na London-wide perspective on the work of the Careers Service and I would strongly recommend\nit to any of the GUC delegates next year to sta'nd for.\n8. Admissions Policy Committee: I have attended 2 meetings of the Committee this session. The\nmain problems identified with recruitment of students are the image which the College has with\nstudents, i.e. the perceived poor standard of teaching, the emphasis on research rather than teaching\nand perhaps most importantly, the high cost of living and studying in London. With the\nac como dati on crisis as it is, and loans and the poll tax just round the corner, the College is going\nto find it harder than ever to recruit students.\n9. ICU Academic Affairs Committee: Richard Spencer, ICU AAO, has done a superb job this year\nand I'm proud to have had such a good successor to my post of last year. He has my best wishes\nfor his final year. He has effectively co-ordinated Ac Aff representation throughout the four CCUs\nand through the CCU Ac Aff sub-committees he has increased the involvement of the Dep Reps.\nThe Committee itself has not had to meet so often as the workload has largely been shifted to the\nsub-committees. I have been generally happy with the reps we've had this year with one or two\nexceptions.\n10. AUT action: This is still a major problem. You will recall that the AUT had a policy of non-setting of examinations in pursuit of their pay-claim. This caused some examinations to be postponed.\nThe AUT subsequently changed their policy to one of non-marking which has meant that the majority\nof students are able to take their exams normally. But in some departments this has meant that\nexams are squeezed together in a short space of time. Biochemists have had the worst time, with\nthe third years' having to sit their finals after doing their projects and second years' having 6 three-hour exams in five days at the end of term. Having studied Biochemistry myself I can sym pathis e with the students' plight. However the Department has refused to budge.\n11. Central Libraries Committee: This Committee was streamlined about a year ago, and although\nwe lost one student representative's place (from three to two) the Committee works much better\nand has made some progress. Chief among these is the introduction of the new Libertas computerised\nlibrary system. There is also the possibility of intro ducting a combined Union/Library card in the\n1990/91 session, which will be more secure than the present arrangements.\n12. Alternative Prospectus: This has finally been published, and thanks are due to Ramin Nakisa\nfor doing what is an unenviable task. I wanted to have an editorial board which would vet the\npublication and deflect criticism from the College away from the author, but I now think that this\nbody should have merely an advisory role. No-one, College nor Union, should have the power\nto tell the democratically elected editor what to put in his/her publication, if the editor has been\nresponsible with his freedom to edit and criticise where necessary.\n2. Overseas Students\n1. Many of you will rightly say that I have not achieved very much for Overseas students. However\na lot of the problems cannot be solved at the College level. The fees for Overseas Students are\nvery high compared to those for Home students. Many of them are unaccustomed to British way\nof life and consequently find it hard to adjust. The College's Committee on Overseas Students\nhas recently produced a policy statement wi ch details the Committee's aims on Recruitment and\nTreatment of Overseas Students. Hopefully this will pass through the College Board of Studies\nand become College policy.\n2. The problems some overseas students face in finding suitable ac como dati on is depressing. Many\nstudents who are sponsored by their Governments don't receive enough money to survive on.\nSome cannot even afford the rents charged in College ac como dati on. These problems will continue\nto get worse as the cost of living increases, in London in particular.\n3. The Union's Overseas Student's Committee has not been as effective in these sorts of matters\nas I would have liked. While the overseas societies continue to organise social events for their\nmembers, there is no effective co-ordination of their activities and I feel that there is no identification\nwith the rest of the Union. It is almost as if there is a complete division between the \"home\" and\n\"overseas\" students in the activities that they pursue, I hope that I'm wrong. International Nite\nwas well attended but the number of problems encountered could have resulted in a serious financial\nloss. I have prepared a paper on the subject and I hope that my recommendations will be put into\npractice by next year's committee. Tieniu Tan has done a reasonable job in the circumstances, having\ntaken over as OSC Chairman in November 1988.\n4. On the subject of OSC finances, there has been a change of Senior Treasurer, and I would hope\nthat a proper system of regular treasurer's meetings will be set up rather than the ad hoc\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\nSCC Chairman\nThis has been a pretty good year. SO'''\"e seen an unprecedented amount of activity on\nthe New societies front, eight new societ u ave set up this year. To compensate for this, nine\nsocieties which had been flagging or had die c completely have been shut down to make way\u2014and\nfunds\u2014for the newcomers.\nIndividual SCC societies have enjoyed many successes throughout the year, too numerous to\nmention, and SCC itself has had a good relationship with the Union, moving generally closer\nthroughout the year. Our total membership has been slightly in excess of 2000 students.\nFor the first time, SCC has awarded its own social colours. The recipients were listed in FELIX\n836, and I congratulate them all. The ties have been ordered, being an IC crest with narrow, di agnon al stripes of gold, purple, white, maroon and gold below. They should start to be visible around College\nlater this year. Some form of colours for ladies is also under investigation.\nAlso for the first time this year societies have been allowed carry over between years. The level\nof carry over( the percentage of a society's closing balance transferred to the following year) depends\non how overspent generally SCC is, and will not become known until after the audit. My personal\nguess is about 85% but don't quote me! In future years this figure will be more instantly accessible,\ndue to improved auditing procedures.\nFollowing the UGM of May 30, the Union is required to liaise with College to find mutually\nagreeable ground to set external band accounts upon. My successor, Stephen Parkus (best of luck\nSteve), is going to have to watch the Union pretty closely to ensure they get on with this and don't allow it to die quietly before a College committee somewhere. No thanks are due to the Union\u2014\nesp. Council\u2014for blocking this one for months when it was obvious from the beginning that the\nstudents wanted it. I can see no greater justification for Council ever to legislate than that it is the\nwish of the electorate but some members found that their own personal feeling superseded any\ndesire to represent students. I probably wouldn't have got so annoyed about this except it wasn't the only time this year I saw it happening.\nHopefully more explanations about these weird accounts will follow in due course. Watch this\npublication!\nWhat else can I say? Heartfelt thanks to all the SCC delegates for sitting through a year of reports\nlike this, to Spenser, Roger, Nicky and Stephen for sitting through Exec, meetings as well, but\nabove all to Simon for doing the tough bit all year through, and ever quitting.\n\"Council? Don't talk to me about Council!\"\nMarvin, the paranoid SCC Chairman.\nRag Chairman\nRag began the year as it usually does, with Tiddlywinks down Oxford Street. It was a little different\nthis yea: as it was partly televised on 'That's Life' star Gavin Campbell fiddled the first wink. The\nterm rapidly shot towards Rag Week and this contained its usual mix of events with a couple of\nnew ones thrown in for good measure: the Rag Week Bar Quiz could only have been described\nas storming and some members of the ICU hockey team did very well for prizes! Other notable\nevents during the Week in l cude da slight contra temps with the local constabulary who couldn't understand how the Raft Race raised money for charity. But as usual in that type of situation, I flitted my eyelids and assured them that 'it won't happen again, officer'. Little do they know...On\nthe subject of the Raft Race, I have never seen such awful cheats as Guilds and RCS were the winners.\nThey also had enough common sense to make a rapid retreat from the Serpentine when a flashing\nblue light arrived at the scene.\nRCS nave excelled at street collecting under Dave Williams and the Great Ormond Street charity\nespecially is several thousand pounds better off due to their combined efforts. Guilds have not\nraised as much money but have carried out a wide variety of events ranging from one individual\n(who shall remain nameless\u2014Cathy) who shut up for a day, to a very successful (and very loud)\ncarnival. As to Mines, who could forget the Dirty Disco, which was wonderful.\nRag Fete, although it was held on the gloomiest day in May, was enjoyed by all who attended\nincluding Gordon Honeycombe, ex-newsreader extra ordinaire, who was our celebrity for the day.\nBut I think the real star of the day was Poppy, the obliging goat, who did her business for Links,\nMud-wrestling was certainly fun hut was a little marred when most of the competitors had to visit\nthe Health Centre the following Monday for tetanus jabs.\nBeing Rag Chairman has certainly been an experience and I wouldn't have missed i* for the world.\n(Yes, I know that'sana ffc liche but it's true).\nI would especially like to thank the following people who have given up vast amounts of their\nvaluable time for Rag even though they're not on Rag Committee: Dramsoc, (how could we have\ndone without you?), Jelly and Beef and the Snack Bar people, (yes, those people from Leicester\nwere born out of wedlock), Dr Hardwick from Civ Eng for all his hard work as treasurer, Roger\nfrom Southside for lots of free drinks for prizes and Chns Browne's Dad for advice on the legal i ties of dubious publications.)\nDeputy President\nContinued\nthe Union Manager and I have set up a very good working relationship with the State University\nof New York, based in Kensington Church St., and quite apart from the social benefits (there were\n39 girls and 7 guys on the course) it has brought in much needed room hire, bar and catering income.\nWe have started to sell \"temporary membership\" of IC Union to these students and they are quite\nprepared to pay. Nigel Baker, Union President, has also been working on the scheme and is\nextending it to many other Colleges.\n10. Staffing.\nIt is worth mentioning a few words about staffing. As the Union is small, changes to the staff can\nhave a profound effect on the amount of work that the sabbaticals have to do (and vice versa).\nFor example, when the Union receptionist left in December it was nearly a term before she was\nreplaced. This created a lot of extra work for the sabbaticals and other members of permanent staff\nin the Office in covering the relevant duties. I have had to sit in on interviews for the new catering\nstaff and receptionist. There have also been one or two disciplinary matters to deal with. Generally\n1 am impressed with the perseverance and dedication with the Union staff approach their jobs,\nespecially as they are working for students who are much less experienced and knowle ge able than\nthey are. In particular 1 have been impressed with the professionalism of the two staff directly under\nme and 1 must say it has been a pleasure to work with the Union Finance Officer and Union Manager.\nI 've learned more about staff management this year than I ever dreamed! would!\n11. Mascotry.\nA quiet year for the Wooden Horse Organisation for ICU, but the CCUs were active as usual. I was particularly pleased to hear of the large donation to charity on the occasion of the return of\nSpanner and Bolt to C+ GU; after all, that's what it's all about. On the ICU side, Mike has appeared\nat most UGMs this year and I would like to express my appreciation to those members of RCS/Guilds,\nwho have consistently turned up to carry Mike and afford him safe passage to and from the UGM.\n1 am grateful to you all.\n12. Conclusions.\nIt's been a hell of a year - but unlike my year as Academic Affairs Officer last year I would not\ndo the job again and I was left in the unenviable position of having no handover from the previous\nincumbent which put me at a disadvantage of having to learn everything by myself. But I 've survived.\nThere have been ups and downs and I will be the first to admit that I have not always seen eye\nto eye with my fellow sabbaticals. However, 1 have mellowed with time and learned to settle into\nthe job. The best part of the job? Attending the leaving dinner for Sir Henry Fisher, former Chairman\nof the Governing Body and imbibing suitable liquids with present/past sabbaticals and senior\nmembers of the College until the early hours. The worst part? Cleaning up where someone had\nvomited outside the Union Office during the Guilds Carnival...\n1 have enjoyed my 5 years at IC, but the time has come for me to move on. To Dave Williams I wish the best of luck for next year; for my part I will reflect on what has been the most momentous\nyear of my life for many years to come.\nCharles Brerelon.\nFELIX\nChampagne Buffet\nFree to members of FELIX Staff\nWednesday 21 June, 7.30pm in the Union Lounge\nFELIX STAFF PHOTO\nMeet 12.30pm in the\nFELIX Office\non Friday 16th June\nEveryone who has contributed to this year's FELIX should attend\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\narrangements that operate at the present.\n5. The Overseas' Reception was held on the Sunday just before the term started in the Union Building\nand was well attended and went reasonably well, even if the Rector didn't think so. 1 had little\nsupport from the Union Officers who were around. The event is going to be organised in the College\nthis Autumn but I doubt if they will get many students to help.\n3. Major Sub-Committees.\n1. ACC: They have been fortunate in having a competent executive, but occasionally the finer points\nof their constitution get overlooked! Good luck to Benji and his team next year.\n2. RCC: I have attended most RCC meetings this year. The finances of RCC have been particularly\nwell kept; the pilot system for the club accounts has run with them this year. Tim King has done\na good job as Vice Chairman this year and 1 am sure that RCC will continue to flourish under his\nChairmanship next year.\n3. Pub Board: The Board lost its Chairman, Syd Harbour-Bridge, early in the year and Jon Denham\nhas been Chairman since. Equipment failure and breakdown has eaten into the contingency fund\nthis year. The FELIX re-equipment fund should increase in size with the carry over s, but it is\nincreasing at a lesser rate than I would have expected.\n4. SCAB: Another good year for the SCAB societies. However Jazz Club suffered a major un he a val at the start of the year. This problem has largely been resolved. 1 am still concerned about the running\nof the Choir and Orchestra, who receive some monies from the College. Their accounts have been\nfrequently overdrawn and financial penalties imposed by SCAB and UFC have little effect. There\nis no effective method of ensuring the accountability of the SCAB Music Committee reps, nor of\nthe Music Committee itself. These issues must be addressed because I believe that they are a serious\ninfringement on the autonomy of the Board to control the activities and funding of its constituent\nsocieties.\n5. SCC: Tom \"Master\" Yates has been an effective SCC Chairman this year. The societies fulfil\na useful role within ICU. However, SCC have raised the ugly spectre of external bank accounts\nand pushed this through an in quo rate UGM. However, the College will not allow them and I regret\nSCC cannot see the error of its ways. I hope the new financial procedures to be introduced next\nyear will eliminate the need for them.\n4. Minor Sub-Committees.\n1. Ents: Paul has done an excellent job in organising events and thanks are due to the hard work\nput in by the Ents Committee. Nevertheless I still feel that more detailed financial information should\nbe available on the state of the Ents account than at present. I would say that this is essential for\nplanning events so that they are good value for money and provide a service for the students.\n2. ICCAG: As far as I am aware, no formal meetings of this Minor Sub-Committee have been held.\nThis is against their constitution, yet the Chairman is a Union Officer and has a seat on Council.\nI fail to see why this should not be an SCC Club with a zero subscription level.\n3. Welfare: The major initiatives have been the survey and campaigns which are described elsewhere.\n4. Accomodation: The Committee has met regularly this session but 1 have not been able to attend\nmany meetings.\n5. Industrial Relations Committee: This Committee has got off to a good start. A student was\nemployed over Easter to set up an advertising database. My only regret and surprise is that hardly\nanyone has gone for the posts available since they would look very impressive on one's CV!\n5. The Union Building.\n1. Security: When I took over the job of DP the security in the building was virtually useless. The\nkey system, designed by none other than Barney McCabe in 1981, was antiquated and the number\nof R37 master keys which could open nearly everything in the building is a standing joke. The\ndecision to buy a new key system was therefore a good one. I designed the new system with help\nof various people and at the time of writing it is 90% installed. There are still some areas on the\nold system but I hope to have them converted by the end of term.\nI consider it essential that the DP has a good working relationship with the security guards in\nBeit and Sherfield and I have built this up throughout the year. Occasionally there have been\nproblems but we have managed to iron these out. Thanks to Terry, Ron, Vic, Mustafa, Pete, Brian,\nLawrence and the other guards. The Union now has its own messenger service from 7am to 6pm and very soon we will have a security guard from 6pm to midnight. My own view is that everyone\nwho enters the quad must have to report to security to show some sort of indent if i cation.2. Room Bookings: Income from these has started to pick up. As the Government cracks down\non student Unions we must address the question of our ex-sub vent ion income and room bookings\nforms a major part of this. Nevertheless I believe that we will be hard pressed to reach our budget\ntarget. I took on most of the administration of the system in January as we had no receptionist\nthen. There is a definite trade off between accepting lots of outside bookings which bring in money\nto offset the expenditure incurred by our clubs and societies and then not having any rooms to\ngive to clubs who want them! For example we have just turned down a booking worth \u00a318K for\nprecisely this reason.\n3. Safety: I recently re-con situ ted the safety sub-committee (which we are re quir? d to have) and\nhave had extensive discussions with the College Fire Officer about fire safety and other related\nsafety matters. The introduction of electronic bolts on various strategic doors will certainly help.\nThe fire alarm system is to be modernised and encompass the whole quad at a cost of \u00a3100K.4. Maintenance: A constant source of aggravation and grief. I seem to spend hours chasing up\nbroken windows, faulty sockets, blown light bulbs, etc. I feel sony for the clubs and societies who\nhave to put up with a building that has been allowed to become shabby and delap i dated. Consequently the number of things that are going wrong on an almost daily basis is depressing.\nA lot of maintenance work is required for the building to be brought up to scratch. The fact that\nthe Estates section cannot be relied on to carry out works on time doesn't help, but things have\nimproved recently, albeit slightly.\n5. Refurbishment: I have embarked on an ambitious refurbishment programme for the Union\nbuilding, mainly because very little was done last year. The areas which have been refurbished\nthis year are: the lounge, the bar, snack bar, senior common room, Union offices, central staircase\ntoilets, Committee rooms (painting only) construct on of messengers' lodge, Union dining Hall,\nrefectory flat, all staircases (painting). Proposed refurbishment works for the summer (at time of\nwriting) to be confirmed are: Removal of dumb waiter on west staircase, construction of third floor\ntoilets (west), varnishing of gym floor, possible construction of second mezzanine level above the\ncrush bar. I hope that I have been able to make amends this year for the lack of works last year.\nThe responsibility for the refurbishment and maintenance budgets for the Union currently rests\nwith the College and we are having the building brought up to scratch before taking these budgets\non. This will not happen before 1992, at the current rate of progress. A refurbishment and\nmaintenance plan is being devised and it is hoped that we will be able to realistically plan our\nrefurbishments around this.\n6. House Committee: This has been a turbulent year for the Committee whose brief is the\nmanagement of the Union building and other Union areas. The first Chairman left College before\ntaking up the post. A new chairman was elected and he, too, resigned after pressure from the society\nof which he was the president. I have been acting Chairman since December and although I have\nbeen gratified by the gradual change in the appearance of the building itself I have found House\nCommittee the worst Committee to chair. Very often the entire minutes would read \"Action: Chas\"\nafter each paragraph, which leaves me wondering if House Committee expects me to do anything\nelse. After threatening to no- confidence me after I had unfulfilled certain mandates I am wary\nof failing them again, perhaps' to the detriment of my other work. It is not surprising that no-one\nelse has wanted to do the job this year. I only wish Murray has better.luck next year than I 've\nhad this year. >\n6. Trading.\nAfter the acrimony and bitterness of last year, I knew that this year would see a slow revival of\nour outlets, but this turnaround will take several years. Part of the process of revival was the\nrefurbishment of the ground floor areas. In particular the snack bar and bar were refurbished to\nthe tune of some \u00a340,000. Whether this re fur b has been 'successful' remains to be seen but my\nopinion is that we have seen a greater number of people using the building and the outlets.\n1. Union Bar: The main bar had the oak panne l ling refurbished and I am pleased that so many\npeople have complimented the new look. The main bar remains as traditional as ever and is very\npopular but the most important benefit has been the increased use of the Lounge bar, especially\nin the early evenings. Sales are healthy and the bar should return a good profit at the end of the\nyear, thanks to Jelly and his staff. This is good news, but there are an awful lot of students who\nnever drink in the Union bar but in Southside and I am aware of the need to persuade them to\ncome back to their bar - the only bar in the College which puts its profits back into the students\nUnion and not into College's coffers.\n2. Catering: After the previous manager was sacked, we appointed a new manager and assistant\nmanager in September. However despite in it ally good figures the Caterpillar Cafe (as it is now\nknown) has slackened off a bit and we are working hard to improve those areas which need most\nattention, chiefly stock control and analysis of sales and I am confident that the Caterpillar Cafe\nshould break even at the end of the year. Ian and Annette have worked hard this year to increase\nsales, especially the dinners which are a good source of income. But those of you who expect a large surplus from the catering account will be disappointed. Very few University catering outlets\nmake a profit, if any.\n3. Bookshop/Sportshop: The Bookshop came under the Union's control at the end of July 1988\nwith a radical change in constitution. However the Bookshop has had many ups and downs and\nthe Sportshop had to be closed because it was losing too much money, through having lots of defunct\nstock (e.g. ties!) The Sportshop stock was sold off in two big sales in November and December\nand I have done the occasional sale of a tie from my office. It is hoped to re-open the Sportshop\nin October.\nThe next big bombshell was the revelation of the large loss sustained by the Bookshop in the previous\nyear (to 31st July 1988). A financial investigation was carried out into the shop bythe auditors and\ntheir recommendations are being put into practice. The manager has since taken early retirement\nand the Union Manager has been appointed acting manager. A shop-fit is planned for the summer\nand Electronic Point of Sale is to be introduced to help stock control. The year-end figures will\nbe bad again this year because there is a lot of stock which has been overvalued.\nAll three of the above outlets are controlled by management Committees of which I am the Chairman.\nMonthly management accounts have been a regular feature of the meetings and this has helped\nus keep a much tighter control over our outlets'than last year. At the same time I try to make contact\nwith the outlet managers on at least a daily basis, to see how they are getting on. I believe that\nthis is part of my responsibility in over viewing these outlets.\n4. STA Travel: Our only franchised outlet on campus, it continues to provide a good service to\nstudents, not t q mention the generous sponsorship and advertising revenue to the Union. A new\ndeal with STA was signed in October allowing them to expand their outlet to the old sports hop site. The revenue forms an in port ant proportion of our non-sub vent ion income. STA also sponsored\nthe \"Summer Savers\" discount leaflet. .\n7. Major Union Committees.\n1. UGM: As sectarian as ever, the problem of in quo rate UGMs has raised its head again and again\nthis session. Having UGMs in the JCR is a mixed blessing as a lot of the people present don't participate in the meeting. The St. Mary's issue produced the most quo rate UGM that I have ever\nseen at IC in my five years here (more than 600 present).\n2. Council: A much more representative body, able to make informed decisions. Council has been\nfairly effective but I believe that it is still too big to discuss fully the implications of its decisions\n(it has 55 members). It is also.prone to change its' mind after three hours of discussion and several\nbeers, which has lead to it being ridiculed by many students.\n3. Executive: The regular meetings at 8.30am every Tuesday are the only time I ever have breakfast!\nExec has dealt with various domestic matters which are very boring, but occasionally it has had\nto make emergency decisions. It is at these times that I have really felt in a position of responsibility.\n4. Union Finance Committee: The ultimate ego-maniacs committee, it makes all the important\nfinancial decisions, on policy and on expenditure. For example it recently decided to spend a substantial sum on the refurbishment of the Bookshop. It deals with setting the budget for the\nUnion. I have tried to make UFC meetings as interesting as possible and have submitted a written\nreport to each one. The financial administration of the Union is split between myself and the Union\nFinance Officer and consultation with him and working on financial matters takes up a large\nproportion of my time. For example, I have recently completed a review of the financial procedures\nfor club treasurers and I am currently working on a policy document which will be the definitive\nguide to the Union's finances. I have had much dealings with the College's Finance Section and\nhave had to represent the Union to the College's Audit Committee which looks critically at the\nUnion's accounts. Despite the image of \"accountants\", I have found the work interesting and\nenjoyable.\nDr. K.E. Weale: I should make special mention at this point of the Union's Honorary Senior\nTreasurer, Dr. K.E. Weale. Ken has been HST for as long as anyone can remember and probably\nbefore that, too! I regret to have to say that he is retiring this year after innumerable years' service\nto the Union. I have worked closely with Dr. Weale this year and I greatly respect his advice and\nguidance on financial matters which has been invaluable. He has my best wishes for his retirement.\nAt the time of writing we are still investigating a successor to Dr. Weale.\n8. Major College Committees.\n1. Governing Body and F&E: The Governing Body is the highest body in the College and the\nFinance & Executive Committees the most powerful sub-committees. Although I am one of the\nthree Union observers, I have been content to allow the President to speak on behalf of the Union,\nproviding backup with my knowledge of specialist areas such as finance and academic affairs, when\nnecessary. Cynics will regard the luncheon provided after the meeting for members merely as a sabbatical freebie, but it is an invaluable period to converse with the most senior members of the\nCollege and often an informal 5-minute chat can achieve more than letters and committees ever could!\n2. House Committee: Another sub-Committee of the Governing Body, |\nt deals with major space\nand resource allocations and has met twice this year. Among the items dealt with include transfers\nfrom the conference to residence accounts, bar licences for halls, and the Silwood park bars and\nrefectories. A fairly important committee, most issues raised will have been brought up at subcommittees at which there are student reps so these will already have been discussed at length.\n3. CCSMC (Catering and Conference Services Management Committee): As the title suggests,\nCCSMC controls the refectory and conference services. It co-ordinates policy from its three sub-1\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nHamlet\nNational Theatre (Olivier)\nHamlet is Shakespeare's masterpiece. The most emotionally\nand intellectually engrossing of\nplays, it deals with the individual's search for a purpose and an identity,\nthe angst associated with youth, the\nuncertainties of the mind, the\nexploration of morality and the\nyearning for motivation and resolve.\nAll this is expressed through the\ncentral character Hamlet, the Black\nPrince.\nRichard Eyre's production at the\nNational is everything the play\nshould be\u2014spectacular, sinister,\nintelligent and mysterious. We look\nupon a majestic sprawling set. Large\nwalls, representing the castle\ncorridors, fold away revealing the\nvoluminous recesses of the threat re, a courtyard with a massive statue of\nthe late King of Denmark, behind\nwhich his ghost walks amidst\nbillowing clouds of smoke.\nThe costumes of the court are\ncolourful and ostentatious, but at\nthe same time the mood is sombre\nenough to give a credible\natmosphere in which Hamlet can\ndeliver his five so lilo ques. The play is foremost about\nrevenge. Hamlet is a young prince\nsummoned by the ghost of his\nfather, the late King, to avenge his\nmurder by his brother Claudius,\nwho now reigns with the Prince's mother Gertrude as Queen. The\ngreat part of the play deals with\nHamlet's efforts to do this. He swings between indecision and resolve, fiercely rebukes his mother,\nClara s Heart\nCert. 12\nClara's Heart marks Who opie Goldberg's return to serious films.\nAfter her last dramatic role as Celie\nin Spielberg's The Colour Purple, she\nmade a series of third rate 'nothing'\nmovies that only served as vehicles\nto propel her into obscurity.\nClara's Heart focuses on the\nrelationship that develops between\nClara Mayfield (Whoopie Goldberg)\nand David, a precocious, angst-ridden kid (Neil Patrick Hams).\nClara is a know-it-all, seen-it-all\nJamaican woman hiding a deep dark\nsecret, which the film withholds\nfrom us until we've lost interest and\ndon't really want to know anymore.\nDavid is just a bullied teenager who\ncan't pick up girls. At first he resents\nthe intrusion of the new housekeeper Clara, but when his\nparents begin to break up after the\ndeath of a baby daughter, it is only\nClara that gives him the attention\nand guidance that he needs.\nThe film starts well enough will\nimpressive shots of a Caribbean\nisland, but then the music becomes\nmore and more monotonous, the\nplot becomes more and more\ntedious and the kid becomes more\nand more unbearable.\nEach scene is swamped in sentimentality that would make any\nsane person nauseous. It is\nobviously supposed to be a tear\njerk er, but by the end one is just fed\nup of the barrage of over sentimental cods wallop and dire piano musa k. It's like sitting through two hours of\nelevator music.\nYou would have thought that\nHollywood would have grown out\nof making such schmaltzy crap like\nthis, but someone somewhere\nthinks that to make a tear jerk er, one\nhas to patron is e the audience in a very conceivable way. Avoid.\nSumit Guha.\nand stabs to death the father of\nOphelia, the girl he loves, who then\ngoes mad and drowns.\nIn the end, Claudius plots for\nHamlet to be killed in a duel\nbetween him and Ophelia's brother,\nLaertes. In the thrilling sword-fighting finale the fate of all the\ncharacters is determined.\nDaniel Day-Lewis takes on the\nlead role and proves himself to be\nThe\nDouble-Bass\nThe Man in the Moon Theatre, 392\nKing's Road.\nThis two act monologue by Patrick\nSuskin explores a day in the life of\na professional double-bass player.\nHe paces around his apartment\napparently too bored to practice his\ninstrument and, in the good\ncompany of a bottle of wine,\nproceeds to reveal his thoughts on\nall matters musical.\nThe double-bass not only\ndominates the rather spartan set\nbut, as the title implies, occupies our\nmusicians mind for much of the\nplay. The two have a curious\nrelationship. He first passionately\nargues his case that the instrument\nis the most important of those in the\norchestra. Suddenly1\nhis position\nchanges and he launches into a frenzied denigration of the bass's attributes by exposing the 'buzzing\ntone' that even he, third bassist in\nthe National Orchestra, can never\na very impressive actor indeed. My initial uncertain t ly about him in the\nrole dissolved as the many layers of\nHamlet's character emerged. His deep brooding brow gives him a powerful presence and the way he\nfeigns insanity for sanity's sake is\ndeftly handled.\nOne always identifies with Hamlet. He is the focus of all our\nuncertainties. His anguished and\npainstaking deliberations seat at the\nsoul. The most famous soliloquy\never, 'To be or not to be...' spoken\nwhen he considers taking his own\nlife, expresses the agonising\nindecision that is a part of his\nnature, and it is performed with\nsuch passion by Day-Lewis that it\nalmost brings a tear to the eye.\nHe is given excellent support by\nMichael Bryant as Polonius, the\nfather of Ophelia, and John Castle\nas Claudius, but Judi Dench makes\na diffident Gertrude.\nAt 3% hours, the play is extremely\nlong (the first half alone is nearly 2%\nhours). However, I found myself\nenthralled by the set, the acting and\nthe power of the play. As CS Lewis\nsaid of Hamlet\u2014he is a 'man whose\nwords make US' at once think of\nloneliness and doubt and dread, of\nwaste and dust and emptiness, and\nfrom whose hands as from our own,\nwe feel the richness of heaven and\nearth and the comfort of human\naffection slipping away.' It's a great\nplay\u2014don't miss it.\nHamlet continues at the National\nTheatre through to August.\nSumit Guha.\nimprove upon.\nThe other main focus of his\nattention is Sarah, a young soprano\nin the National Opera. During much\nof the second half he relates tales of\nhis attempts to be noticed by her.\nHowever, he is also actively\nplanning a final outrageous act\nwhich will surely imprint his image\non her brain forever! The seeming\nimpossibility of their meeting is\nmatched by the gulf between the\nhighest pitched voice and the lowest\nsounding instrument.\nRon Berglas gives a fully\nconvincing performance . of the\nneurotic musician alternating\nbetween dark disp air and intense\npassion. He is supported by a wonderful script of extremely funny\nanecdotes and vitriolic observations.\nIf your preconceived notion of a monologue is that of an actor\ndroning on about some boring topic\nthen take a trip to the Man in the\nMoon Theatre. Be prepared for a surprise.\n]on Wood.\n(351 2876 for booking)\nJune 9 1989 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\n\"So long. \u00ab\nand thanks for all the beer\nOnce upon a time, there was a fresher who sat in the Rector's reception for the 1986/87 session of\nImperial College. He was bored stiff.\nThe Rector told him to go out once\nor twice to the theatre, get involved\nin a club (singular), and not to get\nstuck in some ' God for esa ken factory in the North'. The fresher\nwent to sleep after that.\nThree years later, and I am about\nto graduate from this hallowed\nshrine of academia. I have seen\nenormous changes in three years at\nIC, changes which I find depressing\nand have prompted me to outline\nwhat I see as the writing on the wall\nfor Imperial College, as something\nspecial in the world of higher\neducation.\nSydney Harbour Bridge has\nalready written at length in the\npages of FELIX on the academic\nclimate at Imperial and I agree with\nnearly all of what he has said.\nImperial College's role is to produce\nscientists and engineers for\nindustry. It is arguable as to whether\nor not it is doing this as, although\nI can see so many going into the\nworld of finance after their degrees,\nI would not consider my own experience to be wide enough to\nextend this to all those leaving\nImperial. However, it would be fau-to say that a disproportionate\nnumber of graduates are entering\nfields other-than those covered by\ntheir degrees, or remaining in the\nivory towers of academia.\nThis is not what concerns me the\nmost though. As well as producing\nhighly educated scientists and\nthe places on courses are filled by\nsomebody, anybody. Say what you\nlike about Oxbridge, at least their\nelitist attitude towards entry\nrequirements means that there is\nactually competition to get into the\nplace. It implies that Oxbridge is\nsomething special. If you attend an\ninterview with a group of people,\nand the only selection process is\nbeing sat down in a group, chatted\nto for 15 minutes, told that you're\nall being offered two C's, the\nimpression is hardly one of an\nestablishment which is taking an\ninterest as you as a person. Anyone\nwho thinks that they can determine\nwhether or not a candidate will\nmake a contribution to college in all\nareas purely on the basis of their\nUCC A form is entirely deluded. Yet\nthis is what Imperial seems to\nbelieve is the best way of selecting\nthe people who are effectively going\nto represent the College after their\ndegrees, and in theory keep the\ncandidates coming in when they\nhave left.\nIf, as I believe, Imperial is a unique\ninstitution, worthy of its reputation\nfor excellence, should this not be\nreflected in the care with which it\nchooses its students? You wouldn't believe it from the lackadaisical\nattitude they currently have on\nadmissions. Surely there should be\nsome effort to filter a balance into\nthe system. We need the best\nacademics, but we also need the\nsportsmen, the soci af is ers, the\ndoers, the people who are going to\nmake the place a community which\nwill attract the best, and turn out the\nsort of people industry needs. When\na student is admitted to Imperial\nthere should be a symbiotic\nrelationship. Imperial should give a full and relevant education for\nwhich they get a student who will\nbe a credit to the academic\nreputation of the College, and the\nstudent should be able to enjoy all\nthe aspects of life which will make\nthem a full and mature individual.\nWere Imperial to admit only those\nguaranteed to disappear for three or\nfour years, emerge after this period\nto sail off with a first, and be none\nthe better for it as a person, then we\nwould very rapidly have bugger-all\nreputation.\nStudent life, College's attitude\ntowards their students and the\nStudents' Union itself, have all\nchanged markedly during my time\nut College, following trends which\nhave their roots firmly embedded in\nthe current political climate and\nthose in charge of Imperial.\nThe first person people meet at\nImperial, and the person ultimately\nresponsible for all that is Imperial,\nis the Rector. I find Eric Ash's attitude towards the student\npopulace sadly lacking. His reception speech, which must be\nlodged in some sort of un erasable mental ROM, is hardly guaranteed\nto set the neurone s of new student\nfiring with enthusiasm and\nanticipation. It seems that he\nbelieves students should be the\nguardians of the odd Victorian\nvalues of scientist as artist, spending\ntime expending their minds onto\nhigher artistic plains, visiting\nmuseums, the theatre, art galleries\nand the like. If, in addition they are\ngood at rowing, all the better. Work\nhard, and occasionally get out there\nand enjoy a few of the delights of\nLondon, this is the message.\nHe sadly passes by the traditions\nof Imperial which make is so\nunique. Imperial is a strange\nassortment of genius in all spheres,\noddly planted in one of the\nwealthiest areas of London. It\nshould be a community just as a campus university is. Why doesn't he emphasise student activity\naround College? Why no plug for\nthe Union? Maybe he just doesn't have a feel for the place. There are\nso many people with talents outside\ntheir academic courses who seem to\nreceive little encouragement from\nthe top. The Rector has declined to\nwrite items for FELIX this year, he\nis rarely seen down with the\n'troops', he seems reluctant to make\ncontact with the very people who he\nis relying on to make the reputation\nof Imperial. This is not some sort of\nglorified Grammar School, it is a place where people come to achieve\ntheir full academic and social\npotential. Treat the students like\nsixth former s, and you will get sixth\nformer s. Behave as a headmaster,\nand that is how people will perceive\nyou.\nFew people who come here\nnowadays seem at all interested in\nthe history of Imperial. Most are\nwhat I would consider inverted\nLuddites. All that has come before\nmust be destroyed, everything must\nbe set up a new, in their own image.\nStudents seem less and less\ninterested in fitting in, more and\nmore with changing things to their\nown preferences. I may seem\nreactionary, but it has to be\nacknowledged that it is the past\nwhich gives an institution a reputation. When a student leaves\nfor the great wide world, they will\nrapidly find that much fh the world\nis already laid down and they are\nnot going to burst onto the scene\nand change it all. They are going to\nengineers, Imperial should be\nfulfilling its status as a university by\nturning out fully rounded, mature\nyoung people at the end of their\ntime at College, not dull, pre-pubescent teenagers, devoid of even\na spark of imagination or social\nacumen.\nThe trend in Imperial seems to be\ntowards admitting people to college\nwith regard only to their ' A' level\ngrades. This is reflected in the\nreduction on the number of\ninterviews held with candidates,\nand the trend towards ' A' level\nentry requirements regardless of the\ncandidate. It is not the sort of system\nwhich gives a good social balance to\nan institution, it merely ensures all\nEric As h:At the hub, or left on the sidelines?\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\ndata were returned from Audience Selection. A summary report has now been written and can\nbe viewed in the President's Office.\n6.1.2. Campaigns\nFour campaigns were planned and each was to last a week. The first was held at the end of the\nfirst term and the last three were in the second term. Each of the campaigns was run in a very\nsimilar way, with display boards and leaflets in departmental foyers, and other activities specific\nto the campaign. It is without a doubt that the first campaign was the most successful. The Alcohol\nAwareness week received a lot of internal publicity and attention and I don't think there was anyone\nin the College who was not aware of it. It also received a write-up in the Times Higher Education\nSupplement. The ADS and sexuality awareness week received, perhaps, not surprisingly, a mixed\nreception. Views seemed to range from those who actively supported the campaign and tried to\nstress the facts about AIDS to those who condemned the Union and myself for wasting their money\non something they saw as irrelevant to the majority of IC students. For a few months there was\nquite a good debate about the pros and cons of the campaign on the letters page of FELIX. This\nin itself brought more attention to the subject. In retrospect it is clear that the DSS awareness week\nwas badly timed. By the time it was run most students already had any benefits they were entitled\nto sorted out and it was too far ahead of the summer holiday to look at vacation payments. Next\nyear this campaign will be run at the beginning of the year when it can be of real benefit to the\nstudents. When the fourth campaign was decided upon it was going to be aimed at healthy eating\nbut after discussions with the Riverside Health Authority it was decided to expand this to a 'Look\nAfter Your Heart' week. The leaflets were quite slow to go but the display in the JCR on the Thursday\nwas a great success, mainly due to the 'hands on' nature of the stands.\n6.1.3. Follow-Up Survey\nThe follow-up survey was aimed at assessing the success, or lack of it, of the Welfare '89 campaign.\nSmall questionnaires were sent to the students in the departments of Chemistry, Electrical\nEngineering and Mineral Resources Engineering because they mirrored the College as a whole and\nwere a representative sample. The results of this survey will be available at the end of the term.\n6.2. Welfare Adviser\nThe Union is now fortunate to have its own Welfare Adviser. Yve Posner has taken over the position\nafter Linday Symonds left in March 1988. She is now situated in the old jazz room and the proximity\nto the Union Office is proving to be a definite advantage. Yve's background is in housing and welfare\nrights and this is where most of the advice is give to the students.\n6.3. Childcare\nThe Imperial College Day Nursery currently has forty-four full-time care place for children of students\nand staff at Imperial College. Of the forty-four places, twelve or thirteen are, on average, occupied\nby the children of students.\nThe current fees are set at \u00a352 per week or \u00a3220 per month if paid by standing order. For the\nstudents who are at the upper end of the income band these fees are not too bad, but for those\nin the middle these can only be afforded if the parent released from the role of child care can find\nwork. This finding of work becomes a prerequisite for acceptance of a place in the nursery and\nso a vicious circle is set up, with the second parent unable to look for work until the child is in\nthe nursery. The only subsidy scheme currently available for the less well off parents is that offered\nby Don Adlington, the Student Counsellor. This year this subsidy pot had the sum of \u00a310,000 in\nit but this was a one-off abnormally high payment to offset some of the immediate effects of some\nsharp price rises. The previous year the subsidy from the College was \u00a36,500. Students who apply\nto Don Adlington for a subsidy receive up to \u00a350 depending on their own disposable income, a sliding scale is used to determine the exact level of each student's subsidy.\nApproximately five years ago the local council became concerned about the care for some of the\nchildren of students from Imperial College. This resulted in discussions between the College, the\nlocal health authority and care workers. No progress looked like being made until a fund was Tound'\nby the local council. This fund was used to give subsidies to the poorest of the parents and these\nenabled some of them to afford the nursery places, especially when the level of subsidy was up\nto \u00a3100 per month. When coupled with the College subsidy this left some parents only \u00a370 per\nmonth to find. At the end of 1988 the 'found' fund ran out and the local council had no option\nbut to stop the subsidy to the parents. This resulted in a number of parents having to withdraw\ntheir children from the nursery. These places were then offered to some student parents on the\nwaiting list. Unfortunately many of them had heard about the Kensington and Chelsea Council\nsubsidy and so were relying on this to be able to pay the fees once a place had been offered to\ntheir child. It has since taken four months to fill the places in the nursery as time and time again\nthis problem has occurred.\nVarious sources of funding have been sought to replace the withdrawn council subsidy but nothing\nhas been forthcoming and it seems more and more likely with each day that nothing will be found.\nIt therefore comes down to the grim reality of the situation that unless more money can be found\nto sub sid is e place in an expanded nursery there will be many children of students at I.l peri al College\nwho cannot benefit from the nursery's facilities and teaching. The students themselves will also\nbe unable to study without worry about their children and, in some cases, the children may be\nin danger of being neglected.\nA working party was set up in Novemebr to look into the possibility of using the Union Building\nto set up a play group. The legal and financial side of the play group were investigated however\nsuch a group would rely on quite a large parental input which was not forthcoming and it was\nfor this reason that the working party had to report that such a group is not feasible at present.\n7. Other Responsibilities\n7.1. Staff\nIn addition to the new Welfare Adviser we have a new Assistant Administrator and Snack Bar,\nnow the Caterpillar Cafe, Management. All are fitting in we l and working really hard for the Union.\nWe were sad to see Kathy go after many years of loyal service and she will be missed. Within the\nBookstore, Roy Hicks, the Manager, also decided to leave taking early retirement.\n7.2. St Mary's The merger of the St Mary's Hospital Medical School with Imperial College took place on August\n1 1988. This was celebrated by a gala ceremony in the Great Hall. Unfortunately the same cannot\nbe said of the two Unions. Despite the formation of a working party and what has been described\nas an 'imaginative' solution to the split site problem the two unions are as far apart as ever and,\nwere the truth to be told I believe that it will be a very long time before they merge. It will probably\nresult in the College Governors 'giving' the Union a new set of by-laws which will incorporate\nthe St Mary's Student Union as a CCU.\n7.3. Transport\nThis year myself and Ian Morris had to take over the running of the Union's seven van fleet from\nthe Deputy President because he was unable to cope. I have been responsible for the administration\nof the fleet with Ian covering the servicing and repairs. This has worked well. The vast majority\nof weekends have seen all seven vans used and on only one occasion has someone asked for a van before the deadline and not received one. One apology 1 must make is th t as far as psychic\npowers are concerned it's been a poor year. 1 have not been able to 'see.' which van a particular\nclub would like, I have not been able to for et w ll which roads a society is (o use and for this 1 humbly\napologise.\n7.4. Insurance\nThis has been a real eye opener this year. A few c liam s have had to be made and the water ski boat has given me hours of fun. I am in the process of giving the Union's Insurance manifest a complete overhaul so that we cah be insured to the right value. Accurate insurance lists of equipment\nhave been obtained and in future club captains will have to sign to take financial responsibility\nfor their club's equipment. MSC chairmen are to be the only people with the power to 'write-off\nequipment and this should reduce the number of incidences where equipment gets 'lost'.\n7.5. Executive Committee\nThis is the only committee I am chairman of (thankfully). It has met weekly without fail throughout\nthe year and has been a useful information swapping forum. The ability to call meetings al such\nshort notice has been very useful in dealing with emergency matters. It wa nothing new for the\nExec to meet twice in one day and on March 7 it actually met three times.\n8. Conclusion\nThis year has been enjoyable on the whole although I wouldn't do such a job again. I wish Neil\nluck next year and his thirteen month term should be a definite advantage. The last word must\nbe reserved for the two people to whom I will be forever grateful. Jen has been invaluable to me\nthis year and I feel sorry for the first President who will not have here to bounce ideas off and\nto use as a mine of information. It's not without reason that I call her 'Boss'. Secondly, I must\nthank Fiona for putting up with the job, and me!\nNigel x. Hon Sec (Events)\nEntertainments/Events\nIn previous years there has been no sabbatical directly connected with the Entertainments Committee.\nThis year, one of my main areas of responsibility has been the coordination of entertainments and\nassisting the Ents Committee. Due to my past involvements in Ents and the fact that the Ents Hon\nSec and Treasurer had work commitments during the summer, I found myself working very closely\nwith the Ents Officer in the preparations for Freshers' Week. This link was strengthened due t \u00bb\nthe resignation of the Ents Hon Sec at the time who had not worked as he should have.\nWith a turnover of over \u00a320,000 it is essential that the committee have office space to work in\nand I hope that future Hon Sees will allow them to share their office.\nThe biggest problem in staging Union events has been the small contingent of idiots who seem\nto take great pleasure in trying to avoid paying the entrance fee. Considering that the regular gigs\nhave cost about \u00a31.50 to \u00a32.00 a time, it is pathetic that these people refuse to realise the value\nfor money the events offer.\nApart form assisting Ents, it was my job to organise certain other events.\nThe first of these was the Freshers' Fair which consisted of over a hundred stalls spread throughout\nthe campus on the second day of term.\nThe running costs of the fair were covered by charging external organisations an attendance fee.\nThe level of this fee has not really been kept in line with inflation and, considering the growing\ncompetition between banks for student accounts, could be significantly increased in the future.\nThe next major event was the Commemoration Ball on October 27. Until this year, the Ball had\nbeen held within College and it was felt that interest in the event was low. It was therefore arranged\nin the Dinosaur Room of the Natural History Museum where a three course dinner was served\naccompanied by a guitar/flute duo.\nAfter the dinner a jazz band then played before everyone returned to the Union Building to dance,\ndrink and gamble until 4am. The only problem with the night was that there was too much drink available in the Museum\nand everybody was inebriated too early.\nThe turnover for the event was approximately \u00a317,000 and was run on a break-even basis.\nOn January 26 I ran a risk by staging a wrestling tournament in the Great Hall. Despite very\n. extensive publicity the event was not overwhelmingly attended perhaps due to people being unsure\nof what to expect.\nI believe that everyone who went enjoyed themselves and I would recommend a repeat tournament\nwhich should be successful based on the reputation of this year's. As well as these specific events I have also organised, in conjunction with Ents, fifteen Wednesday\nnight discos, five bar quiz es, the Rag/Hyde Park Relay Party. The purchase of the 50\" TV screen\nalso allowed me to show the Superbowl, the Bruno fight, the Five Nations Rugby Matches, the\nFA Cup Final and the Arsenal/Liverpool league game. All of these were successful and were linked\nin with bar promotions for which I am indebted to the Bar Manager.\nThe Stuff the Poll Tax Carnival was attended by about five hundred people, less than usual because\nterm finished on a Wednesday. A Carnival should be held this time of year in future (just prior\nto the Easter vacation) but with a proportionally smaller expenditure compared to the other carnivals.\nRag\nNot having any experience of Rag I have tried to help the committee wherever possible and attended\nthe Rag Conference at Leicester in January.\nI have been able to do most things like the Guilds Carnival and I see the Hon See's role in the\nfuture as helping Rag with areas in which they require experience of running events.\nI have worked with Rag on some Union events during which they sold cocktails or red noses\nand ran a cloakroom.\nI was put in charge of sorting out the Rag Fete and I believe that as long as comprehensive\ninformation is passed down, this would be a good arrangement for the future.\nTransport\nOriginally, the van fleet was, the responsibility of the Deputy President but it was decided that\nthis would be more easily handled by splitting the job between the President and the Honorary\nSecretary.\nI was therefore faced with the job of maintaining the fleet. The difficulty has been, on-the whole,\nwhen minor repairs have been necessary. I haven't had the time or education to 'nip' down and\nfiddle with a van, and to put it into a garage would not have been economic. Instead, I waited\nuntil there were a number of small defects and then got the van serviced or checked over.\nThe 'Repairs to be done' book in the Union Office has got a number of entries which is far smaller\n\n"

    "content": "Heroes hi Beijing\nAn opinion by Shen Ning\nChina\nThe last weekend has seen\nunprovoked indiscriminate\nmurdering of students, workers and\nother innocents on the streets of\nBeijing, the full horror of which has\nonly just been touched upon by the\nnewspapers and television. The\narmy is still firing at people on the\nstreets and Beijing is now a killing\nfield. The behaviour of the Chinese\ngovernment and army is not only an\noffense to our beliefs in democracy\nbut also totally inhumane.\nAs a group of British and overseas\nresearch students we feel that we\nalong with all students at IC need\nto act now in support of our fellow\nChinese students and the Chinese\npeople. We understand that we\nshould not interfere with the\npolitical struggle within the Chinese\ngovernment. But we must express\nour strongest condemnation to the\nChinese government for the killings\nof the peaceful student\ndemonstrators and innocent people\npassing the street.\nIn order to know more about the\nevents happening in China we\ninterviewed S henNing, the\nspokesman for the Chinese\nStudents and Scholars Association\nin the UK, who is one of the\norganizers of the recent protesting\nmarches and demonstrations in the\ncity of London.\nQ:I know that you come from Beijing\nyourself but who are the people that\nCSSA represents?\nSN: CSSA is the organisation for\nstudents from the People's Republic of China, which stands\nfor Chinese Students and Scholars\nAssociation. It has branches in\nuniversities throughout the world.\nThe majority of members of CSSA\n(UK) are sponsored by the Chinese\ngovernment or the British Council.\nThere are about 150 Chinese\nstudents and academic visitors in\nImperial College at the moment.\nQ: What are the feelings among the\nChinese students in UK about the\nkillings in Beijing?\nSN: Everybody is greatly shocked\nand deeply mourning. Many of us\ncouldn't believe the blood-bath we\nsaw in TAM Square on TV. This\nfascist activity is the greatest crime\nin China's modern history. We\ndenounce the Li Peng government\nand strongly condemn the\ngovernment's slaughter of innocent\nstudents and people.\nQ: Have you been able to contact your\nfamily in China? What is their response?\nSN: Yes. I called my family in\nBeijing several times in the past few\nweeks but in recent days I could not\nget through. Some friends of mine,\nhowever, did manage to call their\nfamily in Beijing as well as in other\ncities. The people in Beijing were\nin shock and in great fear for the\nmassacre. But people in other cities\ndo not fully realise what's happened in Beijing since the state\ncontrolled media tell lies. The truth\nis gradually spreading over the\nwhole country and demonstrations\nand workers' strikes are seen in\nmany cities.\nQ: Under the current circumstances,\nwhat action can you take here?\nSN: The most important thing at\nthe moment is to stop the army\nkilling the people. We have\nprotested against the Chinese\ngovernment's repression of its\npeople by organising\ndemonstration marches and rallies.\nMore than five thousand people\njoined the march on 21 May when\nmartial law was declared and many\nthousands marched to the Chinese\nembassy last Sunday to protest\nagainst the killing. We have\nappealed to the British government\nand the general public to show their\nsupport to the students in China\nand to condemn more strongly the\npresent Chinese government's barbarism. We are calling the\nwhole world to take every possible\naction against the Chinese\ngovernment. We also realise that it\nis critically important to let all\npeople in China know the truth. We\nhave been sending material that\ndescribes what's happening in\nBeijing to many people in China by\nFAX and letters. We believe if the\npeople in other parts of China\nknow the truth of Beijing's massacre, they will unite and fight\nagainst the government. We ask for\ngenerous donations for those died\nand injured .\nQ: As students in a western country,\nwe are deeply inspired by the courage of\nthe Chinese students that they are\nrisking their lives for demands of\ndemocracy. From your point of view,\nShen Ning, the leader of CSSA in IC and the spokesman of CSSA\nUK, is doing postdoc to rial research in the Physics Department.\nwhat is the best way that we can help\nChinese people? ,\nSN: I appreciate the concern and\nthe moral support of students here.\nI think it would be most helpful if\nBritish students and the public\ncould press the British government\nto take tougher measures against\nthe Chinese government. I was glad\nto see that many IC students and\nstaff have signed the petition\ndemanding further government\naction on Wednesday. Also writing\nto MP's or other cabinet ministers\nwill help.\nQ: There are reports about the possible\nsplit in the Chinese army. Is there any\npossibility of a civil war in China?\nSN: It would be encouraging if\nthese reports have been confirmed.\nHowever, it is certain that army\nleaders are divided on the way the\ndemonstrators should be dealt\nwith. It is too early to suggest that\na civil war could happen; I would\nbe inclined to see a military coup\nagainst the hard liners.\nQ: Suppose Li Peng and the hard-liners\nhold their power with the help of troops\n\\this time, Do you think it will lead to\nmassive arrests and execution of\ndemonstrators?\nSN: That would definitely be the\nconsequence and China would\nenter its darkest era. Student\nleaders and intellectuals are the first\nto be purged. But even if it\nhappened I am sure that they would\nnot last long and a bigger and more\npowerful revolution would soon\noverthrow a fascist government\nsuch as the one now in China.\nDeath on the streets.\nJune 9 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

The College\nhopes to install the new PA over the\nSummer. There are also plans to\nimprove the lighting and acoustics\nof the Hall in the future, although\nthese are not firm.\nThe Rector told FELIX that there\nhave been complaints about the\npoor standard of the Great Hall for\n20 years, which he felt were\nhighlighted by the poor sound\nquality at this year's 'Ways out of\nthe Arms Race' conference. He added that he would like to see an\nimprovement in the Hall's soundproofing to prevent\ndisturbances to students in Reid and\nPippard Lecture Theatres.\nObituary\nLOU A I FOUAD SAYE GH The sudden and tragic death on\nMay 13th of Mr Louai Sayegh, aged\n24, is a great loss for his many\nfriends at Imperial College.

Next Year's Welfare\nOfficer will be elected at the Union's Annual General Meeting on June\n20. Jackie Scott and Alastair Goodall\nare currently standing for the\nposition.\nTop-up\nloans\nknocked\ndown\nA report in The Guardian this week\nclaimed that the Government's plans for top up loans for students\nhave been opposed by more than\n100 of the organisations consulted.\nMinisters have refused to publish\nthe 142 formal responses to the\nWhite Paper. The article claims that\n64% of universities support a grants\nsystem whilst the remainder\nsupport a graduate tax.

Felix Says\nThe Unions decision not to award\nSocial Colours to members of the\nMajor Sub-committees (MSCs) is\nexactly the sort of decision that I have come to expect from the\nnarrow minded w* n kers who inhabit the Union Office. It would\nbe asking too much to expect the\nUnion Officers to appreciate the fact\nthat the MSC' s contribute more in\none day to the life of the average\nstudent at Imperial than the Union\nOfficers do in one year.\nPractically every student is a member of one or more clubs or societies. Surely, the hard work put\nin by members of the MSC, which\nbenefits so many students should be\nrecognised by the Union in the form\nof Union Social Colours?\nIt comes down, of course to the!\nmisapprehension by Union Officers\n(who so incestuous ly award themselves and their cronies colours\nat the drop of a hat) that they are the\nUnion.\nB*U*cks! As I have said before, the\nUnion is made up of every student\nat Imperial College and it is about\ntime the Union office recognised this\nfact and gave those people who have put so much contribution to\nlife at Imperial the recognition they\ndeserve.\nJelly Jelly he's our mate, we all\nthink he's really\ngreat.\nHappy 23rd Birthdayjor today\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7\n2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

    "content": "Annual Reports\npracticalities of installing such a pitch showed that it would not be a good idea to lay the pitch\non land where the gravel had been extracted. This was because if there was any subsidence or\nproblems with the pitch it would be very difficult to assert a in exactly whose fault it was and we\ncould find ourselves with an astroturf pitch that couldn't be used and a legal battle to show where\nresponsibility lay. At the Finance and Executive Committees meeting in November a paper was\npresented by the Chairman of the College Athletics Committee asking for the release of up to \u00a3350k from the monies already received but also asking for the committees to sanction the forgoing of\nincome of between \u00a390k and \u00a3100k from gravel that would have'been extracted have the pitch not\nbeen built. This was passed and the committees also reaffirmed its commitment to the building\nof a sports hall in South Kensington. This money was released so that the pitch could be installed\nover the summer of 1989 so that it would be ready for use from October 1989. However, these\npitches require a very good clerk of works to supervise their installation and the person we require\nwill not be available until the summer of 1990 and so the pitch will be put in for use at the start\nof the 1990/91 session. Towards the end of the first term of the present session the Athletics Clubs\nCommittee had second thoughts as to whether the money should be spent on an Astroturf pitch\nat all. The problem was finally resolved in favour of installing a pitch. The upshot of this is that\nthe Union now has policy on how matters regarding the use of the gravel fund shall be taken before\nthe Trustees. In future the Union Council will be the only body that has powers to refer matters\nto the Trustees and the Council itself will expect proposals to come via the Union Athletic Clubs\nCommittee. Although this sounds very bureaucratic it is necessary to avoid the mess that we got\ninto over the Astroturf pitch.\n3.3. Athletics Committee Constitution\nThe College Athletics Committee is in the process of having its terms of reference updated. The\nmain change is that the membership is to be increased by two. The Past President Trustee of the\nHarlington Gravel money is to be included along with a representative from St Mary's. The Union\nhas been pushing for clarification as to the control and ownership of the sporting facilities of Imperial\nCollege.\n3.4. Harlington and Teddington Rationalisation\nThere have been discussions at the College Athletics Committee which are aiming at rational ising the sports grounds of Imperial College and St Mary's. An analysis of the usage ofthe the facilities\nshows that if student sport is to be maintained at its current level both grounds will be required.\nIf a ground was to be sold it would have to be Teddington because it is far and away the smaller\nof the two. Teddington has certain trust provisions which means that it is highly desirable, though\nnot essential, that it remains as it is until at least 1994. This means that at present the grounds\nare safe but it is im per it ive that future Presidents and Athletics Club Committee Chairmen keep\na watching eye.\n3.5. Health Club\nAt present the Union is investigating the feasibility of utilising the space under the Southside Hall\nof Residence as a Health Club. The proposal is that there will be weights machines, free weights,\nsauna or steam rooms, sun lamps and a shop. The plans are currently in the very earliest stages\nand nothing is expected to happen for a while yet.\n.4. External Affairs\nThe Government have caused me more than a little work this year.\n4.1. Top-Up Loans for Students\nThis year the Government announced their proposals for the introduction of top-up loans for\nstudents in conjunction with the freezing of the grant and the removal of students' entitlement\nto DSS payments. An EGM was held to discuss the proposals and the result was that the Union\nhad policy to oppose the introduction of loans per se but that we should also face up to the reality\nthat the proposals may go through and to fight for a better deal for London students who stand\nto lose most from the Government's proposals. On January 19 Peter Brooke, the local MP and\nChairman of the Conservative Party, came to the College to speak on the loans issue. 1 was\ndisappointed that only 300 students turned up but a good question and answer session resulted\nin a lot of people realising the ignorance of a lot of MPs with respect to the problems faced by\nstudents as a whole and by those in London in particular. This talk was followed by a green card\nlobby of the Houses of Parliament and thanks are owed to all the academic who rescheduled classes,\ntutorials and labs to enable students to attend. One of the original mandates from the EGM was\nthat we should liaise with the NUS over the loans issue. The NUS were only prepared to link with\nus if we were to have are affiliation ballot before Easter 1990. This was accepted by a UGM but\nthe NUS have been absolutely no use since they have constantly failed to pov ide us with information\nas agreed. The,NUS want the ballot in the second term next session because there are a couple\nof colleges having d is affiliation votes in the first term. The NUS obviously see:u$, as an important\ncollege and so would wish to concentrate a large affiliation campaign in the College, would therefore\nrecommend that the ballot is held in the first term.\nA national demonstration planned for Feburary 1, the deadline for submissions on the white paper,\nwas d roped by the NUS and ULU when the plans were hijacked by the extreme left. Imperial College\nUnion joined the national demonstration on February 25 and, although on a Saturday, was\nsuccessful. We have continued our dialogue with a number of MPs and at the end of last term\na paper outlining the effect of loans on London students was sent to all MPs. It looks as though\nthe Government is going to have to rethink its loans plans but it is still committed to putting them\nthrough the next session of Parliament.\n4.2. AUT Strike Action\nOn January 9 the Association of University Teachers (AUT) started limited industrial action over\ntheir pay claim. This action, in the form of refusal to set examinations, hung over the heads of\nthe students until the action was modified to the non-marking of exams at the beginning of this\nterm. At the onset of the action Imperial College Union condemned the actions of the AUT for\njeo pardi sing the futures of the people who rely so heavily upon them. As the dispute continued\nit became apparent that the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principles (CVCP) were becoming\nincreasingly more responsible for the lack of a settlement and so pressure was then applied to the\nCVCP in an effort to get the dispute settled. It now looks as though the final result will be that\nthe students will get their exams and d egress after all. The Union took legal advice from a barrister\nas to what the contractual position with the College was and we were informed that if the students\nincurred any extra costs in completing their degree then the College would have to meet these\ncosts. \u2022Thankfully it never came to this.\n4.3. Royal Holloway and Bedford New College Merger\nDuring last session a working party was set up to see if there were any go und s for formal talks\nbetween IC and RH&BNC on the subject of merging the two colleges. The working party finally\nreported in February of this year. A recommendation was made that a 'Joint Planning Committee\nwith wider representation and with the resources to explore the implications of the proposed merger\nin greater detail'. I have spoken to the Rector and he has agreed that if this Joint Planning Committee\nwere to be set up then it would be essential to have Union representation. The merger is not going\nto happen in the short term but it may well happen in the future.\n4.4. University of London Union\nThe links this year between the University of London Union and ourselves have been the strongest\nfor a number of years. This has been due to informal discussions but also through the two main\nULU bodies as far as ICU is concerned.\n4.4.1. ULU General Union Council\nULU GUC has been as left-wing as ever this year but it was interesting to note that next year's President, although pro-NUS, is a student activist and not a party politician. This bodes well for\nnext year with a moderate ULU executive. As far as policy is concerned motions proposed by ICU\nconcerning loans and the AUT dispute were both defeated and policy very different to our own\nwas passed. One problem there has always been is with getting GUC delegates once elected to\nattend. ICU gets nine delegates to each meeting and so the only hope we have of bringing some\ncommon sense to the proceedings is to ensure all our delegates turn up. In future if are pre se native fails to attend two consecutive GUC meetings, for any reason whatsoever, they will be deemed\nto have resigned and a new delegate will be elected to replace them. This should ensure the voice\nof ICU continues to be heard at ULU.\nULU President's Council\nThe President's Council is a new ULU body which was set up this year. It meets once a month\nand each constituent college is in iv ted to send a representative. The Council has no formal powers\nbut is a very useful forum for exchanging ideas and keeping informed as to what is happening\nwithin the federal union and also at the other colleges of the university. Attendance of the Council\nhas now been added to the President's job description as a measure of the importance of the\nmeetings.\n5. Postgraduate Affairs\nAt the beginning of the year I thought that this would be the area in which I would have most\nproblems since I have never been a postgraduate student. In retrospect I don't think that this has\nbeen too much of a problem.\n5.1. Postgraduate Departmental Representatives\nWhen I took office I had hoped to introduce a postgraduate network of departmental representatives\nthroughout the College with these backed up by a departmental committee with representatives\nfrom each section. In order to achieve this an open meeting was called so that a contact in each\ndepartment could be found. The meeting fell foul of post a graduate apathy\u2014only four people turned\nup, and that included myself and the Postgraduate Affairs Officer. An attempt was then made\nto pursue this aim through the individual departments but again this proved fruitless. It really gets\nto me when people slag off the Union, saying it does nothing for them, when they cannot even\nbe bothered to do s dem thing for themselves. This particularly applies to the Postgraduate population\nof this College.\n5.2. Silwood Park\nOver the summer I visited Silwood Park on a number of occasions to see if I could help with some\nof the problems they were encountering. Everything seemed to centre around the College's plans\nto turn the main house at Silwood into an up-market conference facility. This, linked with some\nproblems due to the Technology Transfer Centre, meant that a lot of student facilities were in danger\nof being lost or having their control taken over by College. The major problem faced by students\nat Silwood is the isolation and for this reason it is essential that sufficient accommodation is provided\non-campus because they cannot simply jump on a tube and get to College. Coupled with this the\nrents and facilities must be affordable since students cannot 'vote with their feet' and go off-campus.\nLast summer there were proposals to increase the rents quite considerably, up to 20% in some\ncases. The Postgraduate students just could not afford such increases, especially the overseas students\nwith families. After a lot of discussion with College a compromise was eventually reached but it\nwas thought that the alarm bells had been rung loud enough for the College to hear. Unfortunately,\nthis does not seem to have been the case. At the Finance and Executive Committees meeting of\nMay 12 the final proposals for the Conference Centre were tabled. On the whole they did not look\ntoo bad except that the students were expected to foot the total bill for a new hall of residence\nto replace the rooms lost in the main house, even though these rooms were lost solely to\naccommodate the conference centre. Although the general feeling of the committees was that this\nwould be an asset to the College a decision on the future of the conference centre has been delayed\npending an investigation of the internal requirements and possible usage of such a facility. The\nmajority of the committee were also in agreement that the conference centre should pay for the\nbuilding of new rooms to replace those it is to displace. A new proposal is to go to the full Governing\nBody on June 23 where a final decision will be made. I feel that a word of congratulations is due\nto Ian Lowles, the Silwood Park Chairman, for the work he has done this year. His efforts have\nnot gone unnoticed in South Kensington and the students at Silwood owe him a great debt of\ngratitude.\n6. Welfare\nThis is the second of the ares which I prior it is ed at the beginning of the year. It is something which\nI have been known to get on my 'high horse' about a few times but I feel very strongly that this\nCollege and Union do not do enough for the welfare of our students. It is worth remembering\nthat one of the objects of the Union, as stated in the by-laws, is 'to represent and to safeguard\nand advance the interests and welfare of the students of the Imperial College'.\n6.1. Welfare '89\nWhen I took office on August 11 soon realised that the Welfare advice and information we gave\nour students was not very comprehensive and the information we did give was of a very general\nnature. In order to address this problem 1 cam up with a six stage welfare project for the year which\nwent under the title of 'Welfare '89'. The stages are ed pended upon further in the next few sections.\n6.1.1. Initial Survey\nIt was decided well in advance which areas of welfare should be covered but where to place the\nemphasis in each campaign was still unknown and it was for this reason that a survey was\nundertaken. The areas covered were; accommodation, finance, eating habits, drinking habits, drags\nand sexual behaviour and attitudes. The results of the survey was to be used to tailor the campaigns\nto meet the needs of our students as closely as possible. We had the help of a professional market\nresearch company, Audience Selection, and they helped me formulate the exact working for each\nquestion. This was made all the more difficult by the fact that we wished to examine attitudes as\nwell as obtain purely factual information. For this they received no payment and thanks are definitely\nowed to Sue MacEwan for all her efforts. The result of this work was a16 page survey which went\nto every registered student in the College. This even included those students at St Mary's. We\nreceived 1108 returns, which is the norm for this style of exercise, and from these 144 pages of\n\n"

'We urge our country to respect\nthe deep concern of the many\nChinese students in Britain who fear\nfor the future if they are obliged to\nreturn to China in the next few\nweeks after completion of their\nstudies.'\nThe vigil was moving and emotional, but many Chinese\nstudents were angered by the\npresence of socialist groups who\nwere using the occ as sion to\ndistribute leaflets and sell copies of\nLabour News and Socialist Worker.\nUniversity of London Vice\nPresident Louise Van Stratten told\nFELIX later 'Killing is not political.\nThis was a memorial not a rally.'\nEarlier in the day 1000 people\nattended a demonstration by the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\n. in front of the Chinese embassy\nwhen petitions calling for an end to\nthe violence in China were\npresented to embassy officials.\nThe Imperial delegation placed a wreath on the 'martyrs for ire edom' memorial and passed a petition ot\n756 sign it ure s( including the Rector\nProfessor Eric Ash) to the police\nwho handed it to an embassy\n.official.\nSpeakers at the demonstration\nurged British students to press u rise the Government to take economic\nand political sanctions against China\nand to give assurances of protection\nfor those Chinese students who are\nabout to complete their degree\ncourses and for students from Hong\nKong.\nLaurence Wong, of the the\nChinese Solidarity Campaign told\nFELIX that the British Governments\nsilence on China amounted to the\n'most cal loir s inhumanity.' He condemned British politicians for\nnot taking any measures to protect\nBritain's2,600 Chinese students\nwhen President Bush has already\noffered sanctuary to America's40,000. The Solidarity Campaign was\nestablished in April this year when\nthe problems in China first came to\nthe fore. The organisation, based in\nShaftesbury Avenue has been\nsending money to the campaigners\nin China via Hong Kong although\nlines of communication have now\nbeen severed.\nSupport by London's student\nunions for the students in China has\nbeen growing. Yesterday, as\nanxious students tried\nunsuccessfully to fax messages to\nrelatives in China, the University of\nLondon Union (ULU) has pledged\nto provide publicity and administrative help to Chinese\nstudents campaigning against the\natrocities in China and UL U President, Ruth Benzimera will\npresent a paper to Monday's Collegiate Council, calling for the\nUniversity of London to make a stance in support of Chinese\nstudents.\nThe paper will ask the University\nto waive fees for Chinese students\nin England should the Chinese\nGovernment suspend their grants\nand asks London Colleges to take\nthe events in China into account\nwhen marking the Chinese\nstudent's examination papers. It\nalso calls for the University to exert\npressure on the Govenrment to\nextend the visas of Chinese students\ncurrently in Britain.\nStudents at Imperial College have\nsigned 432 letters, which will be\ndelivered to Sir Geoffrey Howe,\ncalling for the British Government\nto openly condemn the actions\ntaken by the Chinese Government\nand to take sanctions against China.\nAn account has been set up in the\nNational Westminster Bank as a hardship fund for Chinese students\nat Imperial College, should their\ngrants from China be cut off. The\nStudents Union will be placing\ncollection boxes in the refectories\n\u2022today and next week whilst members of staff will be making\ntheir own collections.\nA meeting for Chinese students\nand academic visitors has been\ncalled by the Rector next Thursday.\nFELIX has received unconfirmed\nreports that one of the fifteen British\nstudents on exchange in China for\nLondon's School of African and\nOriental studies has refused to leave\nthe country in order to join student\nleaders in their campaign against the\ngovernment.\nISSUE 839 9 JUNE 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\nPresident\n1. Introduction\nThe year promised to be quite an event with each of the executive sabbatical officers working to\na new job description. The net tre us lt of the previous year's shuffle was that although two areas\nof representation there was an increase in the administration I was required to do. All in all the\nnew job descriptions are working quite well although I question whether the Deputy President\nhas time to look after two areas of representation in addition to the Union's finances and the Union\nBuilding itself. I fear that this may become an even more ac cute problem in a few years time when\nwe take a greater responsibility for the building. One point that should be made is that we are\none of the few student unions in the country that occupy a listed building and so this should not\nbe neglected.\nThis Union is set apart from the majority of others in that it does not have a full-time welfare\nsabbatical. This is something that I believe should be addressed next year. Having been responsible\nfor the welfare of the students this year I have found that when the associated areas of\nAccommodation and Overseas Students are included the result is a full-time job which I have not\nbeen able to give the attention that it war rents this year.\n2. Accommodation\n\u2022\n1 see the main purpose of a students union as assisting students to obtain their degree. This is\nthe reason they come to college and so the activities of the students' own Representational and\nOrganisational body should reflect this. To this end the areas of welfare, which I consider to include\nAccommodation and Academic Affairs are the most important. Since 1 have been responsible for\nWelfare and Accommodation this year it is in these areas that I have concentrated my work.\n2.1. This Year's Rents\nAt the beginning of the year there was some unrest from the students at the level of the rents they\nwere expected to pay. This started in Fisher Hall where, under the direction of thier re-applicants,\nthe students paid what they considered to be the correct amount. Not surprisingly, this was less\nthan the amount that had been set by the Student Residence Committee. The level of rent had\nbeen agreed during Christine Taig's year as President and so there was very little, if any, room\nfor manoeuvre.\n2.1.1. Rent Strike\nAt the Union General Meeting of 25 October 1988 a motion was passed which instructed the Union\nOfficers to take the threat of a rent strike to the College with a view to forcing College to put some\nof its 'surcharge' on Overseas Students fees into the residence account. This round about way of\ngetting College to put money into the residence system was necessary because of the University\nGrants Committee, the then grant awarding body for the university system, rules stated that no\npublic funds could be used for accommodation of students. This was then taken to the Wardens'\nSub-Committee of the Students Residence Committee (SRC) and the full SRC itself. Both bodies\nwere sympathetic to the views expressed but expressed doubts as to the practicalities of such a scheme. Due to the lack of positive response I tabled a paper outlining the position to the College's Finance and Executive Committees which met in November.\n2.1.2. College Finance and Executive Committees\nIn what I see as a direct response to my paper the College Secretary, John Smith, tabled a paper\nat the same meeting which proposed we tackle the problem of student accommodation head on\nrather than in any round about way. These committees, the most important in the College, agreed\nthat the residence account was under-funded to the tune of about \u00a3100k each year. It was decided\nthat \u00a350k should be transferred to the account to cover insurance and notional wardens rents as\nthis did not contravene UGC rules. The Union's response was seen as far too complex to work\nin practice but an alternative was proposed which was adopted by the committees. The College\nwrote to see if the Overseas Students' 'excess' fee could be used at the discretion of the College.\nAn initial reaction was received from the UGC but this did not answer the question and so a reply\nis still awaited from the University Funding Council (UFC) which has super cee ded the UGC. At\nthe Finance and Executive committees meeting this term the committees were reminded by the\nCollege Finance Officer that a sum of \u00a350k to \u00a3100k is still to be provided for residences and a decision\non this is to be made at the committees meeting in November. The threatened rent strike was called\noff at this point and it ought to be pointed out that the only objections raised by the Governors\nwere to the threat we issued. College were not prepared to be dictated to by the students and so\n1 would urge all members of the Union to think hard about the possible consequences before any\nsuch action is proposed in the future.\n2.2. Next Year's Rents and Beyond\nNext year is the final year of Christine Taig's agreement with College over the level of rents to\nbe charged to cover the costs of buying and refurbishing Fisher Hall. Next year's rents have been\nset at \u00a344 per week for Southside singles ranging down to \u00a328 per week for the Evelyn Gardens\ndoubles. The extra \u00a350k earmarked for the residence account and the probable extra money now\nmean that the account should break even in the 1990/91 session. With interest rates at 14% I cannot\nsee them rising any further and so any future drop should be used to sub sid is e the students' rents.\nA1% fall in the interest rates would save the residences \u00a370ka year. College seem to have resigned\nthemselves to the fact that rents will not rise between the 1989/90 and 1990/91 sessions. It is up\nto the students to ensure that Niel McCluskey, next year's President, makes sure that this is the\ncase and rents fall in real terms from what can only be described as their current ceiling.\nAnother issue that came up this year was the problem of College charging students for an extra\nweek to cover the Christmas vacation which entitled students to use their room throughout that\nperiod. This caused a mixed reaction with those wanting to stay in residence of the vacation\nsupporting it, and the other students complaining, but it would have been interesting to see what\nthe reaction would be to all the students not wishing to stay having to clear their room. It looks\nas if next year students will only be charged for the time they are in the residence but this will\nmean that all others will have to clear their room.\n2.3. Payment of Rents by Installments\nMany students, not the least of which are overseas postgraduates, receive their maintenance grant\nor scholarship monthly and so have great problems when it comes to paying bills termly. This is\ncurrently being addressed but the College's answer is that the system would cost \u00a325k per year\nin lost interest. This is true but this interest does not go into the residence account, it goes into\nthe capital investment account. It was amazed to hear that the Warden's Sub-Committee have\ndecided not to back my proposals and so it looks as though in future students are going to have\nto pay for the 'privilege' of paying their hall bill by installments, at least in the short term. 1 wish\nnext year's SRC representatives luck in the longer term.\n2.4. Fresher Applications\nAs from this year the system of fresher s applying to the intercollegiate hall of residence has been\nchanged. Whereas, in the past, they could apply to the University accommodation with the\nknowledge that they would still get a year in an IC hall or house. In future this will not be the\ncase, a year in an intercollegiate hall will count as the year in a hall of-residence and students will\nnot be able to come back to an IC hall. Given the choice between having their year in hall five\nmiles away and being on campus or half a mile away 1 didn't think that the College would fill\nits quota of places in the intercollegiate halls. This have proved to be the case. Brian Levitt, SRC\nChairman, said that if there were insufficient applications then students would just be shared in\n. those halls that seems to be what has happened.\n12.5. Married Flats\nj At present the residence stock includes some married flats in which only one of the residents is\nan IC student. It has been decided that, although being a family of a student is no fun in central\nLondon, these should be converted into student flats and be made ready for renting out at the\nbeginning of next session. In this way the number of students in these flats, which must be the\n! first priority, can be increased from ten at present to almost forty.\ni2.6. Size of Rooms\nIn the present halls and houses owned and leased by the College there are a number of double\ni and triple rooms. With a number of alterations planned for the summer the question was raised\n| as to whether the double and triple rooms should be kept or should the College policy be that\ni we head toward single rooms in all residences. This question was put to a UGM with no response\n| and so the Union Accommodation Committee decided that in future single rooms should be aimed\n' for if possible. This has the advantage that the income from an area of hall will be increased and\nso this will help in keeping rents down.\n2.7. Deposit Repayments\n. Last year's warden of Mining House, Catie Brown, seemed to go a little crazy when she went through\nthe process of considering the damage done to the house by last year's residents. The majority\nof them found that they had been charged practically the whole of their damage deposit, which\nseemed a little excessive! After correspondence with the chairman of SRC, the Finance Department\nand the College Tutor the matter was solved with full refunds for all. This led onto the question\nof how Ic.ng it took to refund the deposits to those students who hadn't wrecked their room. After\nheated debate in committee meetings again the College's intransigence won the day. I find it\nincredible that College expects students to pay their hall bill within ten days but cannot refund\n\u2022room deposits until three or even four months after the students have vacated their accommodation.\n2.8. Head Tenancy Delapidations\nA similar 'deposit' problem was encountered with Hamlet Gardens at the beginning of the year.\nWhen last year's residents from Lexham Gardens received their deposit reports they found that\n:\nmost of them actually owed College money! College, very magn amino us ly, agreed not to pass this\nextra charge onto the students. It was then pointed out that most of the damage had in fact been\ncaused by previous residents and this was confirmed by the student managers of the residence.\nThe students all received a full refund but the College residence account was out of pocket from\nthe hand back to the owners of the property. From next v ear an additional 5% will be added to\nhead tenancy rents to cover this hand back cost and this will make the head tenancies totally\nself-financing.\n1\n2.9. Vacation Arrangements\nThe control of the halls over the vacation period has now been transferred to the accommodation\n; office after the death of the conference office. This should result in a greater level of income to\nthe residences which will help to keep rents down. Part of the transfer has resulted in differential\nrents for students over the long vacation. Those who are undertaking academic study will only\npay the normal term time rent but those students remaining in London to work or to have a holiday\nwill have to pay a rate2 h of the way between the term time rents and the outside summer rate.\n2.10. Subwardens Working Party\nOne of my major accommodation commitments this year has been to a working party set up to\ninvestigate the sub warden ships of the residence system. This working party met on a number of\noccasions and came up with the recommendations that sub wardens accommodation should be a double room with washing and cooking facilities but not a toilet, a nominal job description was\nalso decided upon and it was generally felt that for the work that they did for the life of the hall\nand the students they were very good value. The full report of the working party is available for\nconsultation in the President's Office.\n3. Athletics\nAs the sabbatical responsible for athletics I'm primarily responsible for the a the let ic facilities and\nnot the individual teams.\n3.1. Harlington Gravel Trust Fund\nAt the beginning of the year the College Investments Committee was responsible for the money\naccruing from Harlington Gravel but there was no formal mechanism for releasing this money when\nit was desired by the students for sporting facilities. At the College Finance and Executive Committees\nmeeting of 12 May 1989 a resolution was passed which, after five years of pressing, finally established\nthe proceed ure s for the release of the gravel funds. The resolution stated that the Governing Body\nconfirms its commitment to administer all existing and future sporting and athletic facilities for\nthe benefit of the students and that arty income arising from the use or disposal of such facilities\nwill be applied for the benefit of students. The income from such facilities is to be placed in a Trust\nof whom the Trustees will be the chairman of the College Athletics Committee, a past President\nof Imperial College Union and the President of Imperial College Union. It was also decided that\nthe President of the Union will be an observer at meetings of the Investments Committee which\nis to retain responsibility for the investment of monies derived from the sale of gravel from\nHarlington. In reality, the President will only be present at those meetings which will consider\nthe Harlington Gravel funds. The gravel proceeds now stand at \u00a3l,265k and are estimated to rise\nto \u00a32,500k.3.2. Harlington Astroturf Pitch\nUpon taking office at the beginning of August it became apparent that various members of the\nAthletics Clubs Committee had been pushing for an Astroturf hockey pitch to be put in at Harlington.\nSome of these plans were quite g radios e and contained ideas for employing staff to run the facility\nfor outside bookings and it was in these peripheral problems that the delays were occur ing. On\nOctober 3 Mark Rayfield, ACC Chairman, Paul Skipworth, ACC Vice-Chairman and myself met\nPeter Mee and Dr David Hardwick. At the meeting we decided that, initially at least, we should\njust concentrate on producing a facility for student usage. If later we decided that we should allow\noutside usage then that would need to be considered at that time. Further investigation of the\n\n"

It has been interesting to see\nhow the College dealt with the large trading deficit on the catering side last year.\n4. Refectory Users Committee: A pretty uneventful sub-committee of CCSMC, it deals with\nsuggestions and complaints about the refectories and routine administrative matters.\n5. Bar Committee: Another Sub-Committee of CCSMC. This is the only College Committee of which\nthere is a student Chairman (except Bookshop Committee, at the moment) and as the sabbatical\nresponsible for the Union bar, I am the Chairman of the Committee. We have had one meeting\nthis session but another is planned for June 8th to review bar prices for the next session. As there\nis a polarisation between the Union and Southside on the one hand and the Holland Club on the\nother, the Committee is not very effective.

The American Perspective.\nI feel 1 should report on my activities in this area even though they have been largely taken over\nby the President.\nI was first introduced to the numbers of American students living and studying in the South Ken\narea by Syd, last year's President. The possibility for social interaction was good as they are generally\ndoing arts courses and have a more balanced male/female ratio. Reciprocal membership arrangements\nwere set up with some of the Colleges with whom I had contact and I went to their introductory\nsessions to extol the virtues of IC Union and its facilities. I am pleased to say that many of the\nstudents have come over to IC and some have got involved with our clubs and societies. In particular\nContinued on supplementary sheet\nSCAB\n1. Societies\nChamber Music have been very active enjoying their largest ever membership. The new Imperial\nCollege Chamber Orchestra, formed in January, performed for the first time. Apart from its numerous\nconcerts the society continues to arrange useful coaching sessions for its members.\nChoir have had another successful year. To large and receptive audiences they preformed Haydn's Creation, Bach's St Matthew Passion and Poulenc's Glorie. Their social calendar is as busy as ever.\nIn performance they have been a credit to both the Union and the College as a whole.\nDebsoc have now joined RCC I was sad to seem them leave SCAB but hopefully, under new\nmanagement, debating will grow to take the place it rightfully deserves at Imperial College.\nDramsoc continue to be hyperactive. Their main shows were 'The Nerd' by Larry Shue and \"The\nPossibilities' by Howard Barker. Once again the touring company is running a venue at the\nEdinburgh Fringe Festival under the guise of Theatre West End. Technical services to the Union\nhave improved with the provision of improved lighting facilities.\nFilmsoc go from strength to strength. After initial problems with their projectors they obtained\npermission from UFC to plan the purchase of improved equipment which will enable them to extend\nwhat is a very popular service in College. In the meantime they continue to screen films regularly.\nFolk Club have had a disappointing year after last year's renaissance. There is certainly room\nfor a vital Folk Club but the committee have not managed to generate any enthusiasm for the so de ty. This is an area on which my successor will have to expend some effort if Folk Club is not to die.\nJazz and Rock lost their rehearsal room to the new welfare officer before the start of the year.\nA new room was found for them but the delay in equipping it caused the club much inconvenience.\nI am pleased to say that this has been settled largely through the hard work of the committee and\nChas Brereton. Chas deserves special praise for persuading College to pay for the fitting out of\nthe new room! On a happier front it has been a successful year for Jazz and Rock. Their 'Hops'\nhave been well attended and lots of fun.\nOrchestra, under the guidance of Richard Dickins, acquitted themselves admirably against some\nvery difficult pieces. Their main concerts included Elgar's First Symphony, Sibelius' Violin Concerto\nana the gargantuan Mahler Three. Their ambition was match ecf both by their ability and their large\naudiences. I found it particularly pleasing to see members of the Orchestra undertaking solo parts.\nWith an exec ellen t hard working committee under Sue Foister Opsoc have had a most successful\nyear. Lots of new faces, acquired at Freshers' Fair, have invigorated the so de ty and I hope the\nnew committee have learnt the lesson\u2014members are everything! Their main show was \"The Pirates\nof Penzance' by you know who. The traditional summer visit to Budleigh Salterton carries on with\nTolanthe'.\n2. Music Committee\nThere is not a lot to say about this committee this year. After losing the Music ,Room last year,\narrangements have stabilised somewhat. The Reid Theatre has been equipped for/tyus ic Making'\nand seems to be acceptable to its users as a temporary home. Prof Isham's committee are currently\ntrying to get the Rector's agreement to, and help in, seeking funding for an extension to the Sherfield\nBuilding to serve as a dedicated music complex. The Union should actively support this venture.\nIt would be a worthwhile addition to the College Campus.\n3. SCAB Nite\nThis year SCAB raised just over one hundred pounds for Rag. Members of all the SCAB societies\ntook part. My thanks go to all who helped make the evening a success. The standard of the\nperformances was extremely high and the small crowd was, thus, a great disappointment. My\nimpression is that few SCAB societies even try to encourage their own members to come along!\nI would suggest to my successor that tickets are produced beforehand and are distributed to club\nchairpersons to sell (through their committees) at least a week before the event.\n4. Finance\nSCAB was sad to lose Prof Bill Wakeham as HST. He has served us well over many years but felt\nthat he could not combine the job with that of Head of Department of Chemical Engineering. I would like to record our thanks to Bill and wish him all the best in his new post. We are, however,\nfortunate to welcome the services of Dr Chris Champion in his stead.\nNext year promises to see major changes in all MSC finances with the introduction of 'carry over s'. SCAB which generates most of its own income stands to benefit from this change in UFC policy.\nSome careful thought on policy regarding 'club carry over s' will be required early next session.\nReggie has begun the long process of harmon ising all the various accounting procedures which\nhas seen SCAB de computerised. Room Booking\nRoom bookings have been a continual source of anguish all year. Both Dramsoc and Opsoc have\nexperienced problems with both rehearsal space and, more seriously, Concert Hall bookings for\nperformances. After much grief House Committee have come to an eminently sensible arrangement\nwhereby Opsoc, Dramsoc, Ents and Rag will in future meet to organise dates before room booking\nRna lW^ \u00b0 U'de', m\":ate*? pr0 ble m which have** \u2022aU \u00ab\u00b0\u00b0 <\u00ab8\"Ur the past year\nFinally, ,t has been a successful year for SCAB.

The Sports\nGround at Harlington has all but disappeared on the north side of the road with earth moving\nequipment where the cricket square used to be. The money from the gravel extraction continues\nto accumulate, as yet none of it has been spent. The majority of it has been allocated for a Sports\nCentre in the Kensington site. The plans for this were drawn up last year, but there is a problem\nobtaining planning permission.\nAt present the recreational facilities which this College can offer its nearly 5,500 full-time students,\nare amongst the worst at any educational institution of comparable size in England.\nIf the Old Chemistry building is demolished then we will lose our only indoor training facility\nlarge enough for badminton and other comparable sports. The Union already spends nearly \u00a32,000\npa on subsidies to hire indoor facilities for clubs which have reached a standard where they cannot\ncompete in a College facility. This figure will rise in future years as other clubs either increase in\nsize or standard and require a larger indoor sports area than we can provide in College.\nAt Harlington itself the number of teams wanting to use our sports facilities is increasing, whilst\nthe number of pitches available is decreasing because of the extraction plans. This is despite the\nexcellent efforts of Mick and the other ground staff who are making the best of a difficult situation.\nThe first area of reinstated land was due to have been handed back by the contractors last September,\nit was not ready and it must be expected that further reinstatement s will take longer than originally\nplanned. Part of the remainder of the gravel extraction monies have been allocated to build an artificial\nsurface which will ease some of the demand for space as it can be used more than once on any\ngiven day, and may allow training at night if floodlights can be installed as part of the development.\nThe news is not all gloomy and the number of people actively involved in ACC clubs in College\nis approximately the same as last year at 1,700, the number of active clubs has reduced slightly\nbut the remainder have almost all increased their membership and their general standards.\nThe ACC hasn't finished yet this year, the athletic colours are yet to be awarded and at present\nwe may have a problem with the elections. Please keep an eye on the pigeonholes if this concerns\nyou.\nMark Rayfield.\nInternal Services Officer\nThe year started off with the Internal Services Committee trying to act as a users forum for comments,\ncomplaints and suggestions on all of the Union services. After ads in FELIX there was very little\nresponse with the odd person preferring to publicise their one complaint in FELIX rather than\napproaching the committee. This led to the committee doing little in its first term other than\noverseeing the Haldane Library Record and Book Buyers, part of the committees constitutional duties.\nIn the spring term the feeling within the Union was that all of the services could do with a little\npublicity and promotion. In order to do this as one campaign meant co-ordination of information\nand ideas from all of the services. Apart from Council there was only one body set up to do this.\nThe Internal Services Committee thus took on the role of advertising the services. The committee\nworked hard and the end result was the distribution of around 2000 leaflets advertising the services\nand giving discounts to you the students. Our thanks go to STA for covering the finances of that\nproject.\nIt has been suggested that more of these kind of projects could be co-ordinated by the Internal\nServices Committee in the future. This would mean a slight reorganisation of the Union committee\nstructure but I think this would benefit both the services and the students. I would not like to see\nthe provision of a complaints forum to be scrapped, even if the students in general don't care to\nuse it that often. I see the role of Internal Services in future as a co-ordination committee, directing\nthe views of the students to the individual services committees and organising the publicity and\npromotions of the services so that the students are aware of what's going on.\nNeil McClusky.\nTransport Officer\nThings have gone quite well with transport this year, mainly due to having the largest ever fleet.\nThis has enabled most requests for vans to be satisfied, although there have been very few v ns free at weekends, the peak time. The oldest two vans are still running, despite having suffered\nfour years each at the hands of large numbers of sometimes less than considerate drivers, whilst\nthe newer five are all in pretty good condition, even WLE.\nIdeally, OLE would be replaced soon, but having already bought PFB out of this year's money,\nwe can't afford another new one at the moment.\nThe harmon is ation of UK driving licence rules with those of other EC countries in a few years\ntime could make the running of the fleet much harder, possibly every Union driver may have to\ntake an official test of some sort, which might be prohibitively expensive.\nDue to the uncertainty about the new rules, even the purchase of a pre-owned van is unlikely,\nat least until we see which way the wind is blowing.\nA couple of small accidents led to the culprits being charged most of the insurance excess for\nthe repairs, whilst some hassle has been caused by people returning vans late, or hanging on to\nkeys for a long time. Transport Committee is taking a more severe line in dealing with in f ringers of the rules than they have in the past, and penalties could well increase in the future.\nDave Wilson.\n\n"

    "content": "Annual Reports\nOverseas Students Committee\nThe OSC has been traditionally one of the less popular MSCs (Major Sub-Committees), and\nsomewhat remote from the rest of the ICU. This year I have attempted to bring the OSC closer\nto the mainstream of ICU activities, and I hope this policy will be appreciated and continued in\nthe future.\n1. Representation\nThe OSC represents not only the various national societies at the College but every individual\noverseas student at Imperial. It is this which leads me to voice my concern at the way the College\nadministration treats overseas students as a direct commodity. The College has realised that the\noverseas students paying overseas fees provide a valuable source of income especially at the moment\nof the slash of educational expenditure by the government, and has initiated a series of intensive\nrecruitment programmes worldwide. This has seen the number of overseas students at IC increase\nfrom some 1,150 last year to 1,500 this year, giving an increase rate of 30.4%. My concern is based\non the fact that the College does not deem it necessary to provide the additional support services\nin terms of welfare and accommodation that the increase in the number of students will require.\nIt may prove possible to increase the number of overseas students on the short term by keeping\nthe current policies. Nevertheless, if the students returning to their home countries are not satisfied\nwith the facilities at IC, they will surely not recommend it to others, and the College may\nsubsequently lose the international reputation it has enjoyed as a high standard educational\nestablishment, and the recruitment will become much harder in the long term.\n2. Constituent Societies\nThe organisation of OSC is very much UN-like. At present, the OSC is composed of 23 constituent\nsocieties. They are, in alphabetical order, Afro-Caribben, Brazilian, Chinese, Chinese Students and\nScholars Association, Cypriot, Egyptian, Friends of Palestine, Hellenic, Indian, Iranian, Italian,\nKorean, Latin American, Lebanese, Malaysian, Mauritainia, Middle East, Nigerian, Pakistan,\nScandinavian, Singapore, Sri Lankan and Turkish. The societies new to this year are Brazilian,\nItalian, Mauritainia and Scandinavian. In addition, the formation of another two societies, namely\nAsian and Indonesian, is currently under consideration.\nThe running of these societies has been in general about satisfactory, and some societies have\nshown a substantial increase in their activities and events.\n3. OSC Executive\nThe OSC Executive is the body which keeps the diary running of the OSC. Most of its members\nhave been responsible and efficient.\n4. Major Events\nSports: The appointment of an OSC sports officer in the second half of the year has been very\neffective. He has been able to coordinate the weekly activities of the various societies in the very\nlimited time allocated for the use of College sports facilities, as well as organise the OSC volleyball\ntournament which took place in April 1989.\nSeminar by Prof A Salaam: A new attempt made this year to publicise the OSC is to organise\nseminars of general interest. This year the OSC has invited Prof A Salaam to give a seminar in\nthe College. The professor, who won the Nobel prize in physics in 1979, spoke to an unexpectedly\nlarge crowd of students about his university life in this country.\nInternational Week/Night: The highlight of the OSC calendar was the International Week/Night\nin February. This has grown into a major event in recent years, attracting more than 1000 people\nthis year, and has gained a reputation as being one of the best international events amongst the\nLondon colleges. The programme of this year's International Night was very comprehensive,\nincluding a national culture display and exhibition, a national culture and fashion show, a traditional\nBrazilian carnival, an Afro-Caribbean disco party, a national food tasting party, and a Chinese variety\nshow. The national food tasting party has been highly appreciated by the participants.\nImperial College Summer Fair 1989: The annual Summer Fair is the traditional major social event\nin the Colege organised by the HUB. This year's Summer Fair will be held on June 18,1989. Again\nto publicise itself, the OSC has actively coordinated with the HUB in the planning of the event.\nIn particular, an International Pavement Cafe will be presented at the Fair by some OSC constituent\nsocieties.\n5. Conclusion\nMay I say this year has been successful for the OSC and its constituent societies. I trust there is\na greater awareness of the international community at IC, giving one the opportunity to find out\nthe various cultures present at IC, as well as giving the overseas students the chance to bring to\nthe attention of all IC students matter of international significance. I am s vre the spirit of\ninternationalism which exists at IC and overrides all else within the OSC will continue.\nIt is my great pleasure to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the members of my committee\nand all those who have contributed in some way towards the OSC this year. May I also wish our\nsuccessor every success in the coming session.\nAccommodation Officer\nAfter kicking off to a somewhat shaky start, the committee got underway discussing a number\nof issues affecting the lives of IC students in their respective halls and houses, the main bones\nof contention being rent levels (what else?), security, sub wardens( not again!) and the overall running\nof the halls and houses.\n1. Rents\nA hotly debated subject in all student spheres, and obviously the bain of the President's life. It\nis no secret that rent levels at IC have escalated to a level which is now at the threshold of the\nstudent market. A survey conducted by the committee of other colleges in London and their rents,\npainted a very black picture of IC indeed. It was felt that not enough information regarding the\n'hidden extras' included in the termly bills, such as key deposit, amenities etc was given to\nprospective students, and that figures quoted in the prospectus didn't give a good enough indication\nof the costs of living in London. Apart from using the AP as a means of getting this message across\nto new students, it was also suggested that at the time of interview and departmental tours the\nissue should be brought up and clearly emphasised.\n2. Houses and Halts\nGenerally, the reports provided by the various reps on the committee gave a clear insight into the\neveryday life of an IC hall/house, thus enabling prospective inmates to make up their own minds\nabout the 'goodies and the baddies'.\nOn the subject of halls/houses the merger this year of Southwell/Mining prompted much discussion\n(and the subject is still being raised), the pros and cons of merging various halls being hotly debated.\nA few major points were brought up to be raised at SRC, the advantage being that the Chairman\n(sorry Chairwoman) of the Committee has had the pleasure of living in both Mining and Southwell\nfor the past two years and is therefore in a strong position to give an opinion as to the advantages\nand disadvantages of a merger and what improvements can be made.\n3. Subwardens\nThe survey conducted by the committee members as to the value of sub wardens unfortunately\nwas misinterpreted by some as bing a kind of 'witch hunt', which it was never meant to be. However,\nthe overall feeling is that they are definitely worth it for the amount of time that they have put\nin, and that any reduction in numbers would be detrimental to the day-to-day running of IC\nresidences.\n4. Security\nTime and time again this issue has raised its ugly head, both by Prince's Gardens and Evelyn Gardens\nreps. Obviously security is down to the students in some respects, but it still doesn't save the overall\nproblems encountered late at night and during the day time, when residences are most vulnerable.\nSecurity is a long term problem, the matter of which needs to be discussed by next year's committee.\nVicky Phillips.\nWomen's Officer\nApologies for what's going to be a very short report but I'm busy trying to finish my project. Anyway,\nthere's nothing much to report.\nIn many ways it's been a disheartening year. I took the post because no one else was going to\nand I believed that someone should. That meant that I didn't have any burning theories on what\nshould be done, I intended to react rather than pro-act. However, no one seemed to want anything\ndone or have any ideas.\nIn other respects the year has gone well. I have sat on Council and on a welfare committee that\nhas helped Nigel run welfare campaigns. I was also part of the Playgroup Working Party which\ninvestigated the feasibility of a play group in the Union. Unfortunately the idea was abandoned\ndue to lack of interest. One of the most successful activities was the free transport home for women.\nThis was laid on after every major event, and thanks to Paul and Ian etc there were quite a few!\nThe service was well used. Many thanks to all the drivers.\nTo finish, I'd like to thank everyone who has helped and wish Nicky Fox, next year's Women's Officer, luck. ,\nGUI Knowles.\nIndustrial Relations Officer\nA new post\nThe post of Industrial Relations Officer, Chairman of the Industrial Relations Committee (a minor\nsub-committee on Council), was created in May 1988.1 was elected as the first IRO in October 1988.\nThe aim of the IRC is to promote favourable links between all parts of ICU and industry. 'Favourable'\nmay be in financial terms or otherwise.\nThis year\nA great deal of time this year has been spent establishing the scope and organisation of the IRC.\nWe've come up with lots of ideas, and put a number ot them into practice. Brief details of this\nyear's major projects are as follows:\nCareers Fair: This is a major service to students and, with a potential five figure profit, also very\nlucrative. The loose ends from last year's fair have only just been tied up, and preparations for\nnext year's fair are already underway. My thanks must go to IndSoc, who did the bulk of the work\nfor last year's fair.\nAdvertising: A student was employed over the Easter vacation in a major initiative to increase\nadvertising revenue for the Union's many publications. We can expect to see results from his work\nvery soon.\nCareers Service: We have worked with the College Careers Service to try to improve their facilities.\nA major refurbishment of the Careers Office is due to take place over the summer.\nSponsorship: With new Union sponsorship rules in place, we are just beginning to start work on\nincreasing industrial sponsorship income for ICU and its clubs.\nMailing List: A number of departments pass lists of final year students on to recruiting companies,\nwho use them for mass mail shots through the internal mail. With lists of clubs committees, we\ncan go one better by providing a mailing service to students involved in organising extra-curricular\nactivities. Mailing lists sell for a great deal of money, and this project could prove very financially\nworthwhile. It should come into action over the summer, as soon as a directory of next year's club\ncommittees has been compiled.\nThe future\nThere is a lot more that can be done to gain sponsorship, both for clubs and for ICU. With numbers\nof graduates expected to fall over the next few years, and demand for graduates steadily increasing,\nrecruiting companies will become more and more willing to spend money in order to get involved\nwith universities.\nNext term's Careers Fair promises to be the biggest and the best yet. Our aim is to provide a better service to students, >and at the same time to make a greater profit for ICU.\nThe potential for Industrial Relations is vast. With universities funding constantly being cut, we\nmust eventually expect to see these cuts being passed on to ICU. Industrial Relations is one way\nin which we can generate our income to supplement our diminishing finances,\nt Finally\nAs yet, nobody has come forward to take up the post of Industrial Relations Officer next year.\nThe job carries a fair amount of responsibility, as you will be representing ICU to the outside world\nof business and commerce, but in return it can be very rewarding. You certainly don't have to\nbe a 'Union hack' to do it, so if you are interested in the job, please contact me {via the Union\nOffice) or sign up on the election papers.\nGavin Spittkhouse,\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nChild's Play Pilobolus\nCert. 15\nI have always found the sight of\ndolls unsettling; the sickening smile,\nthat fixed plastic ky expression, and\nthose flicking eyelids. It was only a matter of time, then, that the horror\ngenre would latch on to their\npotential scare.\nUnfortunately, in Child's Play this\nchance has been missed due to a ludicrous plot, and a misplaced\nemphasis on trying to make the doll\nact as human as possible through a swamp of special effects.\nChucky is the doll in question, aka\nCharles Lee Ray, a mass murderer\nand, get this, a master of the\nmetaphysical art of so ii l transference. Just before being\npinned down by the police in a toy\nshop he calls on the forces of\ndarkness to plant his soul into a nearby doll. A mother (Catherine\nHicks) buys the doll for her six year-old kid and then the fun starts. The\ndoll decides to start killing people\nwhen it's so inclined and, of course,\nthe dum-dum authorities believe\nthey have a psychopathic kid on\ntheir hands, so they lock him up.\nChucky then decides that he wants\nto be human and to do this he has\nto kill the boy. So it is left to the\nmother and a token good guy cop\n(Chris Sarandon) to try and save the\nday.\nThe film lacks any psychological\nsubtlety which in the hands of a good director may have made it into\na masterful example of suspense\nand horror. Instead, as is the\nten dancy these days with the genre,\nSadler's Wells\nI was informed that Pilobolus is the\nname of a hardy, hermaphroditic\nfungus that thrives on horse\nmanure, with that in mind I didn't quite know what to expect from this\ninternationally established dance\ntheatre company. 1 knew it would\nbe strange; modern dance always is.\nBut I was quite unprepared for the\nsurreal dream-logic imagery, and\ncontortion of the body into a wonderland of striking and comedic\nmotion.\nThe six member team performed\nfive pieces. The first, Bonsai, was a short exercise in sexual ambiguity,\nmetamorphosis and illusion, to the\nrhythm of mixed African tribal and\nOriental tones. The fusion of bodies\ninto the strange shapes was fascinating to look at.\nfilm-makers play on the silliness and\nabsurdity of the plot, making the\nexcuse that it's really a comic send\nup. I found myself laughing\nthroughout, but for the wrong\nreasons. You know something is\nwrong when the acting of the 6 year-old kid is far superior to that of the\nadult cast.\nI guess this is the type of film to\nsee when you've had a few pints\nand the inside of your skull feels like\ngravel pulp.\nSumit Guha.\nAs You Like It\nRose Tavern, 86 Fulham Road\nIt may not be the Old Vic, but it is\nwithin walking distance and it is\nover a Fuller's pub. If you can't make it to the real thing, then this\nmakes a good substitute, mercifully\nThe second piece Moonblind was\na solo performance by the incredibly\ntalented Carol Parker. It was a dreamy, sensual dance played to a whining solo clarinet. The first half\nis then rounded off with a jazzy\nnumber to which clownish runners\nfall about each other, emphasising\nthe rapid pace and impersonal\nnature of today's society.\nThe second half consisted of two\nlonger, more involved, and very\nenjoyable pieces. Land's Edge was a surreal reworking of the good\nSamaritan tale, or at least that's my\ninterpretation of it; and I'm Left,\nYou're Right, She's Gone was just\nRock ' n' Roll fun with guys and gals\nand the sound of Elvis. These two\nwere more theatrical pieces and\nwere a joy to watch.\nI'm sure this form of ex peres sion will not meet everyone's liking. Still,\nI found it an enjoyable evening of\nfractured beauty and confusion. The\ndancing is remarkable\u2014part\nacrobatic, part mime\u2014and the\nphysical control displayed is almost\npainful to watch.\nThe company will only be around\nuntil June 17 so why not go and\nexperience their warped, provocative, free-wheeling\nimagination?\nStandby tickets are available at \u00a34.\nSumit Guha.\nfor the fringe, sticking closely to\nShakespeare's script. The cast\nperform capably enough, with\nDavid Solomon outstanding as\nTouchstone. It's a shame about the\nset, though. The modern dress is\npassable, but the dreadful matt\nblack and grey scenery makes one\nfeel that the enemies might not just\nbe winter and rough weather, but\nthe police coming to move\neverybody on.\nBA Costello.\n(225 2501 for booking)\nDirty Rotten\nScoundrels\nRemember Bedtime Story with David\nNiven and Marlon Brando? No, nor\ndo I. Well, here is the remake of that\n1964 flop, now starring Michael\nCaine and Steve Martin, and it will\nalmost definitely be a hit.\nCaine plays a suave, aristocratic\nEuropean con-man, swindling rich\ncorruptible American women out of\ntheir unearned cash on the French\nRiviera. Martin is a crude, small-time American hustler who joins\nCaine, masquerading as his retarded\nrelative Prince Ruprecht (a role that\nallows Martin to go totally over the\ntop in a way we haven't seen since\nThe Jerk). Subsequently, the two fall\nout and then begins a battle of wits\nto determine who gets to stay on to\nscavenge the rich coastal town.\nThis is a charming comedy, with\nthe two stars in excellent form. They\nare joined by Glenne Headley as\n'the bet'\u2014the first one who extracts\n$50,000 from her wins...the other\nleaves town. There are twists and\nturns all over the place and it's all\ngreat fun.\nFrank (Yoda) Oz directs with an\nassured hand emphasising the\ngorgeous splendour of the settings.\nIn all, a delight.\nRelease date 27th June\nSumit Guha.\nPage 8 FELIX June 9 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nhave to fit in.\nThis attitude is seen in the College\nhierarchy. At a time when alumni\nare being tapped for money and\ninterest in Imperial, up comes a proposal for merger with RH B NC and a complete change in the nature\nof IC. All this is promoted by\nperceived harsh economic realities,\nbut is considered sacrilege by those\nwho have gone before, prompting\npetitions in College, and a large\nquantity of mail from irate alumni.\nI consider it insensitive at the very\nleast.\nWhat of Imperial College Union?\nFaced with a College that is less and\nless willing or able to consider the\nneeds of students, from funding of\nthe Union to the simple provision of\ndecent cheap roofs over their heads,\nwhat have they done?\nWhen I arrived at College, IC\nUnion had probably the last of the\n'student' executives. The Union\nstructure was rapidly heading\ntowards the professional money\nmaking attitude it has now, where\nall seems devoted to running profit\nmaking outlets, and little towards\npersonal contact with students.\nChristine Taig still ran a Union\nwhich was controlled by the\nsabbaticals and aided by the\npermanent staff who did most of the\ndonkey work and provided continuity from year to year. Now we have handed our birthright over\nto paid Union managers and\naccountants. Although I realise that\nthe fact that the Union has taken\nover the running of these outlets\nmeans that these people are needed\nto keep things going, I wonder\nwhether we have lost much of the\nfeeling of a 'students' Union in the\nprocess. The sabbaticals are more\nand more concerned with running\nthis side of things, and ensuring the\nmoney rolls in, and less with getting\ndown and meeting students and\nactually listening to them. Students\nshould be getting a good deal out of\nthe Union. If they were, the Snack\nBar and Union Bar would be packed\nevery night. They are not.\nMuch of this is due to the\nsabbaticals we elect. In my three\nyears at College, the only President\nI have seen with the force of\npersonality to achieve what he set\nout to do is Sydney Harbour-Bridge.\nI dislike many of the changes he\nbrought about last year, but at least\nhe had the strength of character and\nthe guts to get what he wanted\ndone, and stand up to College.\nChristine Taig did not set out to\nchange the world, so the world was\nnot changed. She was honest and\naccountable and the Union was seen\nto act for students. Sydney HarbourBridge went all out to kick arse and\nchange things. They changed\ndramatically. He always asked the\nopinion of the students, and he\nIs Imperial dying by degrees?.\nDave Burns takes a look.\nNigel D. Baker: Sod the rest of the world? represented those opinions well.\nNigel Baker set out to do what Nigel\nBaker wanted done, and sod the rest\nof the world. Fair's fair, he's worked\nhard, but he has schemed and\nintrigued his way through the year.\nThe atmosphere in the Union seems\nto me strained and un welcoming. Students are not informed of what\nis going on through the pages of\nFELIX because sabbaticals have\nbecome locked in petty personality\nclashes. The depressing catalogue\ncontinues.\nBy now you're probably thinking,\n'Yeah, why aren't they doing\nenough for me?' The sad fact is that\nthe student body is as apathetic as\nthe politics in the Union Office is\nMachiavellian. Clubs are healthy,\ntrue enough, but few seem\ninterested in putting in the hard\nwork required to run ICU and the\nCCUs on a day-to-day basis. As long\nas the sub vent ion from ICU turns\nup, then people are happy. They\nseem happy to play sport once a week and get on with their courses.\nThere is a lot more to a student\nunion than just participating in your\nlittle but and forgetting that your\nhelp might be appreciated in other\nareas. Rag, Ents, Academic Affairs,\nthe numerous committees all need\na high level of student input. At the\nmoment most of these activities are\nsupported by a dedicated few. (For\nexample: RCS Rag's \u00a318,000 Rag\ntotal has been raised by a group of\nabout twenty 'hacks'.) Students\nappear massively introverted and\nunconcerned with anything outside\ntheir sphere of friends. College\nencourages Hall entertainments\nwith amenities sub vent ions, so\npeople become wrapped up in a limited area and never need emerge\nfrom their place of residence. It is\neminently possible to arrive at\nImperial and never emerge from\nyour dwelling for anything other\nthan lectures. What a marvellous\ntime they must have at College. For\nthree years you can experience the\ncompany of a limited number* of\npeople and really get to know about\nlife! A friend of mine recently gazed\naround the Physics leaving party\nand commented, ' God, what a group of social spastics.' An extreme\nview, but one with a good basis in\nfact. If, after three years in College,\npeople are leaving untouched in\nanything other than their ability to\nabsorb dry facts, then Imperial is\nfailing miserably as a university.\nMy worst nightmare is that\nImperial should become just another\nuniversity. It has a brilliant history,\na brilliant academic tradition, some\nof the most talented minds in the\ncountry, and in the past a wonderfully committed student\npopulation who made it a pleasure\nto go to IC. With increasing apathy,\nthe rising cost of actually living here,\nand College's lack of appreciation of\nthe needs of students, and the\ncontribution which students can\nmake, the slide into mediocrity can\nonly continue. IC needs the best. It\nshould actively seek out and select\nthe best.\nAs for my own feelings on leaving\nImperial, I can only conclude by\nsaying I have fallen in love with the\nplace, warts and all. I have probably\ngot a reasonable degree out of my\ntime here, and made scores of\nfriends. I have had the opportunity\nto meet people from over 65 years\nof IC's history, and actively\nparticipated in many aspects of the\nStudents' Union. My course is one\nof the easier at Imperial, so maybe\nI have had more time than many,\nbut I doubt it. As a sponsored\nstudent all my vacations have been\nspent away from the UK, with little\nopportunity to cram in work I had\nnot done in term time. I have\nthoroughly enjoyed every minute of\nit. I only hope that in the future the\npowers that be will get their heads\nbanged together, and people will\nbegin to appreciate that Imperial is\na very special place. However, you\ncan't just sit on your backside and\nhope that IC will continue to remain\nvital. This is something which\nrequires as much work as it takes to\nget a degree.\nIt will only happen if you make it\nhappen!\nDavid Burns\nRCSU Asst. Hon. Sec. 1987-89\nJune 9 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
