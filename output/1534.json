    "content": "FASHION\nFashion Editors: Alex Ramadan,\nSaskia Verhagen, Alice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA luxurious death\nAlice Yang discusses whether fast fashion is killing luxury brands\nommon knowledge to\nanyone who actually\nwants to embark upon\na career in the near fu-ture, the world economy\nis dragging its feet along the ground\nand practically all global growth has\nbeen brought to a grinding halt. The\nunfortunate result from all of this, besides the lack of money each and every\none of us is painfully aware of, is the\nnegative commotion surrounding the\nluxury sector.\nInvestors around the globe have\nbeen worrying themselves to split-ends as to how much the slow down\nin emerging markets, especially China\nwill e\ufb00ect the likes of Burberry and\nHugo Boss, as well as PPR and LVMH\n\u2013 the corporate conglomerates that\nown high fashion favourites such as\nLouis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc\nJacobs, Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent,\nAlexander McQueen, Balenciaga etc.\nAnd strangely enough, it seems that\nthe answer the boards of directors\nhave found themselves striving for\nis design more, make more and sell\nmore FASTER. In other words, luxury\nseems to be taking a dive towards the\nworld of fast fashion long trumpeted\nby the high street.\nTake for example Hugo Boss: since\nappointing Claus-Dietrich Lahrs as\nCEO of the company in 2008, the\nbrand has doubled the number of\nyearly collections it produces to four,\nreduced their overall development\ntimes and poured \u20ac100m into an automated factory. From the\n\ufb01gures, this s e e m s\nto have worked\nwell for t h e\ncompany, with a\nyear-on-year growth of 6% in its nine-month report this October, leading\nto a comfortable 12% share price rise\nthis year. However, call me cynical,\nbut does this not defeat the point of\nHugo Boss being \u2018luxury\u2019? Surely, the\npremium paid on an item of Hugo\nBoss clothing as opposed to say, Zara,\nshould be mainly due to the exceptional quality of the garment, its prestige and regrettably, in part, its name\nlabel. But once rattled down to the\nbasics, of a t-shirt for example, I hate\nto admit it but the improved quality of\nthe fabric itself no longer justi\ufb01es the\nprice hike given that both Boss and\nZara items are factory made.\nMoving onto an even stranger com-plaint, Nina Ricci\u2019s recent additional\ncollections also seem like a bad move\naway from their luxury high fashion\nroots. The design house now have not\njust the two standard spring/summer\nand autumn/winter collections, as\nwell as the well popularised two pre-spring and pre-fall collections, but\nare now also hosting pre-pre-spring\nand pre-pre-fall collections. All in all,\ngiven that you trust my basic maths\nskills, that adds up to 6 collections of\nwomenswear a year.\nMore explicitly put, in their attempt\nto attract more buyers with their diminishing price points per \u2018pre\u2019 added\nbefore the season, Nina Ricci seem to\nbe heading down the road towards\nthe fash- ion faux-pas land of A\nLittle Bit Of\nSomething For\nEveryone,\notherwise\nknown as Marks & Spencer. You see,\nthe beloved British brand M&S fell\nupon its own arrow towards success when it stopped de\ufb01ning its\ncustomer base, and attempted to\ntarget everyone \u2013 in short, the\ncompany moved too quickly\ninto unknown market terri-tory, and is now sitting on\na share price of just \u00a33.79,\ndown from \u00a37.49 at its\npeak in 2007. And unfortunately Nina Ricci seems\nto be heading towards the\nsame fate. Of course dedicated Ricci fans will still\nbuy their girly dresses,\nbut for those wanting\nsomething \u2018special\u2019,\na bit of something\nthat makes them\nfeel above everyone else, which\nlet\u2019s not even TRY and\ndeny is why many splash\nout on high fashion, Nina Ricci will\nno longer be the design house of\nchoice.\nOnce again, I state my case: the\nde\ufb01nition and success of luxury\nrests on prestige and unobtain-ability. Once this is dissipated, it\nwill not be long before we see an\nerosion in sales, and consequently\npro\ufb01ts.\nWhilst of course there is a\nchance that I may be proven horrendously wrong, but, the way I see\nit, the trend towards fast fashion may\nbe spelling out the \ufb01nal demise of\ncertain brands. These brands\nare such that they are inaccessible enough at the moment\nto be termed \u2018luxury\u2019, yet are\nnot quite topping the stable\nmountains of high fashion.\nOn top of this, there is also\nthe issue of designers\nthemselves. Peter\nCopping, in taking\non 6 lines a year\nfor Nina Ricci,\nmay not be adding too much to\nhis work load,\nbut what about\nA l e x a n d e r\nWang who at\nthe young age\nof 28 will now\nbe designing\n32 collections a\nyear?\nI kid you not,\nfashion\u2019s favourite\nnewbie, on being\nawarded the job of\ncreative designer at\nBalenciaga, is now\nfaced with designing\nmore lines per annum than years\nhe\u2019s lived \u2013 four womenswear and\ntwo menswear for BOTH Alexander\nWang and T by Alexander Wang; four\nwomens and two mens lines for the\nbulk of his new job at Balenciaga; and\n14 other lines (seven collections twice\na year) making up the rest of the PPRowned house. On top of that, there are\nalso swim lines, lingerie, shoes, bags\nand jewellery to consider.\nHe may be young, and full of creative energy, but surely even Wang\ncan\u2019t pump out 32 new full sets of\ndesigns a year for long. And who can\nblame him if he fails, after all none of\nthe old fashion guard have ever successfully taken on so much. In fact\nsome designers, on reaching such a\nlevel of success, decided to go their\nown way: Jean-Paul Gaultier famously\nchose his own brand over Herm\u00e9s,\nand Alexander McQueen too decided\nthat his own label was to win attention\nover Givenchy. Even the multi-tasking\nmasters of creation seem to be \ufb01nally\nreaching the\nend of their creative ideas;\nKarl Lagerfeld\u2019s designs for\nChanel, Fendi and\neven his own eponymous label have\nbeen getting somewhat boring despite\nhis outlandish attempts to spice things\nup (see Chanel\u2019s SS13 hula-hoop bag),\nand even Marc Jacobs seems to be\nrunning out of ideas with polka-dots\nstill not quite escaping his grasp (from\nMarc Jacobs AW11, to Marc Jacobs\nDot Eau to Parfum and now alongside\nLouis Vuitton\u2019s collaboration with\nYayoi Kusama).\nIt seems that the recent onset of\npanic from investors and CIOs pushing for pro\ufb01ts and margins seem to\nhave completely demolished the lessons learnt from John Galliano\u2019s fall\nfrom grace. But perhaps Wang and\nhis fellow new generation designers\nwill prove us wrong, and maybe, just\nmaybe, this new world of fast fashion\nthe high streets have been pioneering\nfor so long might just turn out to be a\nsuccess for luxury too. Whatever way\nthe tides turn, the onset of the New\nYear looks like one to bring exciting\nnew times a-plenty.\nC\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n22\nOut with the old and in with the new? Marc Jacobs, Alexander Wang, Karl Lagerfeld\nMarc\nJacobs,\nAW2011\nYayoi\nKusama\nLouis\nVuitton\nThe\nHula\nHoop\nBag,\nChanel\nSS2013.\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n10\nReporting back on an extraordin\nerelj is located 60km\naway from Ulan Bator,\nthe capital of Mongolia.\nThe national park has\nsmooth sloping valleys\nthat climb up to become rocky peaks.\nThis past July, the rains were plentiful.\nGrass carpeted the landscape, though\nnot the soft type you\u2019d \ufb01nd in your\nlawn. Rather the blades grew in little\nclumps with wiry roots that ran deep\ninto the dry earth. The hardy vegetation provided an abundance of food\nfor the horses, cows, sheep and camels\nthat seemed to have free roam of the\npark. In sharp contrast to the green\nunderfoot, a deep blue sky spread\noverhead with clouds so high they\nhardly seemed to move.\nA narrow strip of pothole riddled\nasphalt carved through the park and\nabout 10km from the entrance the\nroad passed alongside our campsite.\nWe volunteers arrived \ufb01rst. Twelve\nSingaporeans, a Mongol cook, a social\nworker, two translators, and myself.\nWe had a day\u2019s head start to prepare\nfor the kids. When they came, the\ntwenty-\ufb01ve little Mongolians shu\ufb04ed\nout of their bus and made for the gers\n(tents). It took several minutes to get\nthem settled down. Some \ufb01fteen minutes later, they were running amok exploring the camp. One boy hit another.\nSome tried to run o\ufb00. The smaller children were crying. Our attempts to restore order amounted to nothing and\nthe situation became more and more\nchaotic.\nThe children in the camp were not\nordinary. They had been abandoned\nby their families, struck by misfor-tune, left to the vices of the street. The\npolice had rounded the kids up and\nheld them a shelter. That was where\nwe picked them up for the camp. In\ntheir world, authority and rules were\nlacking. We tried to keep them under\ncontrol. We had to. How else could we\nmanage the camp? The \ufb01rst day even-Phillip Rodriguez, an English teacher, writes about his summer spent i\ntually drew to a close and we volunteers returned to our gers exhausted.\nIt is an understatement to say we were\nshocked by the children\u2019s behaviour.\nDay two: the situation got worse.\nThe morning began with \ufb01ve of the\nboys disappearing from the camp. The\ngroup had hitched a passing car and\nreturned to Ulan Bator. The police\nwere brought in and they came down\nhard on the coordinators of the camp.\nIt was several days until we heard from\nthe police that they had made it back\nto the city, and in the time between, we\nwere worried over their whereabouts.\nThere was also concern that others\nmight try to abandon camp. We took\nnight shifts in the freezing Mongolian\nweather to ensure that children did\nnot run away at night.\nFor classes, we broke the kids into\ntwo groups. I was in charge of teaching English. The twelve or so kids sat\nat a table while I scrawled letters and\nnumbers on a white board. They repeated words and made use of their\nworkbooks. To reward them I gave out\nstickers that Stephanie had brought.\nThe ones they loved were those of\nWinnie the Pooh and his friends, but\nthe prospect of getting a sticker was\nnot enough to keep them focused.\nSome refused to do anything, others\nwandered o\ufb00, and those that did try\nwere easily distracted. I mixed in a\nfew games to maintain their attention.\nExplaining the rules and giving a demonstration on itself should not have\nbeen much work, but with these kids\nit took a great deal of e\ufb00ort. That was\nhow it went with everything. The simplest of tasks demanded our utmost\nenergy. For example, when we took a\ngroup photo, all we needed was for the\nchildren to sit down and remain still\nfor ten seconds. However, as soon as\none boy took his place another would\njump up, scratch his head and pick his\nnose. Even with fourteen volunteers,\nwe had to shout, point and pull to get\nthem to do what we wanted.\nHorseback riding was the highlight\nof the camp. One of our translators,\nthe young and a\ufb00able Bilguun, had\nthe local nomads bring their horses\nto our camp. We rented \ufb01fteen of the\nanimals for two hours. They were the\nsmall stocky variety known more for\ntheir stamina than their speed. I went\nwith \ufb01rst group. Many of the children were natural-born horse riders.\nThey smiled, they cheered, and they\nlaughed as they rode round the Mongolian countryside for the \ufb01rst time in\nT\ntheir lives.\nThe great Genghis Khan has now\nbeen dead for over eight hundred\nyears, but his legacy lives on in this\ncountry. Many of the boys bore his\nname, Chinggis, as pronounced in\nMongolian. There was also a Temujin,\nthe name the great Khan had before\nhe became ruler. The other children in\nour camp had names that were harder\nto remember. There was Yataashk, Nemun, Babilguun, Sahnder, and so on.\nSince we failed to learn them right\naway we resorted to using nicknames.\nIn the case of Sahnder, we called him\n\u2018Carry Me\u2019, because the boy went up\nto all of the volunteers and said those\nexact words while reaching up with\nhis arms. And then there was \u2018Horny\nBoy\u2019 who had an a\ufb03nity for the female\nvolunteers and their womanly parts.\nLooking back, I might think it humorous that we called him that had I\nnot known he had spent time on the\nstreets hanging around prostitutes\nand pimps. It was that past that shaped\nhim.\nSadly, the other children\u2019s pasts were\nno better. The boy Temujin had lost his\nfather in a car accident. As a result, Temujin\u2019s family fell apart and his mother being unable to care for him, abandoned the boy. The siblings Pagma and\nKhan-tseg-rik, only four year olds, had\nbeen sent out by their aunt to beg for\nmoney. When the police caught them,\nthe aunt refused to take them back.\nThe authorities did what they could to\nplace street children with relatives or\nin foster homes. I guess you could say\nthe kids were broken, but if they were,\nthey had grown resilient and strong\nwith time. I\u2019d seen it a hundred times\nover. As much as they fought with\neach other, scraped up their legs and\ncried, they always bounced back with\na smile.\nIn time, some of their good qualities\nsurfaced. The 14 yr old boy Temujin\nwas special in that he had a strong\nsense of propriety. Though he was a\nlittle fat and geeky, the other children\ndid as he said. It was a respect that\ncame from the care he openly gave. It\ncould be something as simple as helping the others going to bed. The little\nones needed that. They had no mother\nto tuck them in. No brother to lean on.\nThe older children took on the roles of\nbrothers, sisters, mothers and fathers.\nThis was the world they came from.\nThe real darling of the camp was\nTengis. He was a small boy with sandy\nbrown hair, cherub cheeks and curious eyes. He certainly had cuteness\nin his favour, but it was his carefree,\nhappy attitude that won us over. He\nwas mostly smiles and giggles, even\nfor no apparent reason. Incidentally,\nhis birthday coincided with the camp.\nWe celebrated in the kid\u2019s tent. Rather\nthan a cake, Tengis received a chocolate pie with a single candle sticking\nout from the center. Sitting at the head\nof the table, he looked down and his\nbrown eyes sparkled bright as the moment took hold in his heart. The tears\ncame and we realized then it had likely\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS Business Editor: Deepka Rana\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n20\nGetting in with the Crowd\ntart-ups have to raise money,\nwhatever the business there\nwill be a need at some point.\nThe biggest issue for most is\nhow.\nTraditional options are Business Angels \u2013 wealthy individuals who provide\ncapital and advice in return for equity,\nand venture capitalists who generally\nprovide higher sums of seed but with\nharsher conditions. But, obtaining investment is very hard for \ufb02edgling businesses as these sources rarely part with\nmoney without seeing a proof of con-cept. For many businesses it is extremely\ndi\ufb03cult to get to this stage without any\n\ufb01nancial backing in the \ufb01rst place. Bit\nof a vicious circle you might have no-ticed. Secondly, because the options\nare so limited, such groups hold a lot of\ncontrol over small businesses; an early\nstage start up never holds much bargaining power and the more desperate\nfor money it is the worse the terms of investment are. It is in this way entrepreneurs quickly lose ownership and hence\nmorale in their businesses. Clearly, this\ntype of funding is massively in favour of\nthe already rich and successful. On the\nother side of the coin, this also means\nonly wealthy people have the opportunities to invest money in start-ups. In\nboth cases the regular people seem to\nbe losing out (what a shocker).\nSo, already I have highlighted two\nproblems for entrepreneurship: one,\nstart-ups face a huge uphill struggle to\nget that initial investment, and two, the\nmasses have no platform from which\nthey can invest in new projects. Not a\nvery optimistic view if you fancy your\nfoot on the business ladder. Cue the so-lution: crowd-funding.\nIt\u2019s a pretty simple concept: lots of\npeople each invest a small amount in\na start-up, contributing to a big pot of\noverall capital. This means a company\ncan obtain \ufb01nancing more easily and\ndoes not have to give a majority of equity to one person, the obvious appeal\nbeing that owners can retain more control over their business. Investors also\ndo not need to commit huge amounts\ninto one project therefore opening up\ninvestment opportunities to the general\npublic i.e. the Crowd; hence the concept\nis aptly known as crowd-funding.\nIn fact people can tactfully \u201chedge\ntheir bets\u201d by investing smaller amounts\nin many start-ups in the hope that even\nif some do not follow through there will\nstill be an overall return. This is analogous to the way a venture capital \ufb01rm\nworks, essentially avoiding putting all\nits eggs in one basket by investing in\nseveral companies, knowing that just a\ncouple need to boom to ensure an overall pro\ufb01t; except where Mr V.C invests\n\u00a3100,000 a time, John Smith is able to\ninvest \u00a3100. This is a very attractive option for individuals who do not want\ntheir savings to stagnate in a bank ac-count.\nThe model of crowd-funding has propelled the formation of \u201cmiddle-man\u201d\ncompanies who have seized the potential to design platforms from which this\ninitiative is easily accessible for both\nstart-ups and potential investors. Examples include Crowdcube, a UK lead-er, and AngelList and Prosper.com in\nAmerica. A crowd-funding portal will\ntypically allow start-ups to pitch their\nideas and personalise their pages, which\ncan then be searched for and viewed by\nindividuals. An interesting new take on\nthe world of social networking. Crowdfunding portals are innovating business\n\ufb01nancing even more by allowing companies to o\ufb00er incentives other than\nequity, for example a new bar may o\ufb00er\nfree drinks to the investor if they put in a\ncertain amount of capital. Rewards like\nthis can also promote the start-up to a\nbigger audience and draw in supporters.\nThere are even more obscure crowd-funding platforms such as those for\npublic sector organisations like schools,\nor for artists, perhaps to raise money for\na \ufb01lm production.\nAnother implication for crowd-fund-ingisitsabilitytoweedoutstart-upsthat\nare likely to fail. If a start-up reaches its\ndesired target is it more likely to succeed\nas a business concept? You could argue\nit is. In the case of traditional \ufb01nancing\ninvolving a small number of parties it is\nde\ufb01nitely plausible that those few investors have made a silly mistake, but when\nhundreds or even thousands of people\nhave invested into a business it gives a\nsense of reassurance \u2013 surely that many\npeople can\u2019t be really stupid?\nCrowd-funding: bringing a host of\nstrangers together in one innovative\nmeeting place somewhere in the depths\nof \u201cthe web\u201d where they can join forces\nto drive the success of the newest business generation, and potentially reap\nthe rewards. Is this the ground-breaking\nfuture of business \ufb01nancing? In 2011\nalone $1.5bn was raised via online\ncrowd-funding and I say why not put\nfaith in the masses? We can\u2019t all get it\nwrong.\nJoanna Taylor underlines the benefits of crowd-sourced funding\nS\nJust a short while ago, I was a Fine Art\ngraduate slowly coming to realisation that conceptual art & me is not\na good match. Back then, looking for\na \u2018real\u2019 job, I accidentally stumbled\nacross Songkick and got to be one of\nthe lucky ones to become their intern.\nStarting out as a Data Warrior (don\u2019t\nask), after just a few months I progressed to full-time project assistant\nrole working with the hiring team. The\no\ufb03ce was smack dab in the middle of\nSilicon Roundabout, where the startup scene is buzzing (and before Songkick, I didn\u2019t even know it existed).\nI left Songkick to study full-time\nfor my MSc at the Imperial College\nBusiness School last September \u2013 and\nwhat an intense year that was (anyone\nstudying at Imperial is familiar with\nthe pace)! Not wanting to lose touch\nwith the incredible start-up roots I\nhad planted, I led ICBS Innovation &\nDesign club and sat on a committee of\nEntrepreneurs Interactive. Together,\nwe arranged for loads of famous as\nwell as up-and-coming start-ups to\ncome and speak at Imperial.\nThen, nearly as serendipitous as the\nYPlan app itself, I became an alpha\ntester for what looked to be the best\nlast minute ticketing app on the hori-zon. As I met one of the co-founders,\nRytis Vitkauskas, for the \ufb01rst time\nduring an early UX walk-through, I\nwas enthralled not only by what they\nwere trying to do \u2013 provide tickets for\nsame night entertainment \u2013 but also\nby a really slick app design and awesome user journey (I\u2019ve seen a few alpha versions of other apps before and\ncould only wish that any of them were\nas \ufb01nished as YPlan\u2019s one was). Even\nthough I didn\u2019t pursue the artist path\neventually, I do have an eye for beautiful design. Alpha \ufb01nished in about\na month and I found myself crushed\nthat I couldn\u2019t access the app every\nmorning as per my new ritual.\nThe other co-founder, Viktoras Jucikas, re-contacted me mid-summer announcing that they were taking o\ufb00 and\non the hunt for interns. I found myself\nmore than just interested and started\nas a part-timer (as I was still working\non my \ufb01nal paper at this point), and\nfollowing my last exam, got a full-time\njob o\ufb00er (and couldn\u2019t be more excit-ed). I\u2019ve been with YPlan from the very\n\ufb01rst day (I mean the very \ufb01rst \u2013 where\nwe actually got keys to our brand new\no\ufb03ce \u2013 at that time, a shared o\ufb03ce\nspace at TechHub). As the concept\nbegan to pick up steam, we quickly\noutgrew our o\ufb03ces moving to a much\nmore suitable space in King\u2019s Cross.\nFrom 6 people on the very \ufb01rst day\nto 15-full time and 2 freelancers in\njust a few months, not to mention a\nphenomenal launch with impressive\npress mentions (Wall Street Journal,\nWired, Guardian, Gigaom, The Mail,\nShortlist, and #1 New And Noteworthy as chosen by Apple, just to name\na few), I\u2019d say it\u2019s been some pretty\nawesome growth for a brand new\nstart-up! We\u2019ve just announced seed\nround investment of $1.7m, our user\nbase is growing, the events are being\nbooked, and YPlan is standing next\nto other mobile commerce apps such\nas Hailo, Uber, Hotel Tonight, Airbnb\nand the likes. As smartphone users are\ngrowing (currently making up 50% of\ntotal mobile subscribers in the UK and\nnearing that in West Europe and the\nUS), the time couldn\u2019t be better for the\nmobile commerce apps to start taking\nover the world.\nTo give you a bit of a background of\nYPlan \u2013 it\u2019s the world\u2019s \ufb01rst mobile-only ticket booking app that makes\ngoing out tonight easier than it ever\nwas. Londoners can get inspired,\npay in two taps, and go on the same\nnight. UK ticketed entertainment is\na $5bn industry, utilised only at 50%,\nand currently only 2% of events are\ncompletely sold out, so YPlan solves\na problem for venues and promoters.\nIt also allows Londoners to be more\nspontaneous and book awesome stu\ufb00\nfrom a carefully curated list of events\n(think chess boxing, rickshaw racing,\nrooftop cinemas, art exhibition open-ings, ping-pong tournaments, cabaret,\ncomedy, brewery tours, etc.) in some\nof the best venues you never knew\nabout. The simplistic design makes\nthe experience a breeze and no need\nto print out tickets, just show the\nin-app-ticket on the door (oh, and it\nworks with Apple\u2019s Passbook, too).\nOur team is awesome & has unrivalled\nexperience from places like Time Out,\nToptable, GetTaxi, Airbnb, lasminute.\ncom, Goldman Sachs, and more\u2026 and\nI think I\u2019m really lucky to be among\nthem.\nNow, if you\u2019re interested in start-ups and follow their game, you\u2019d say\n\u2013 what do you need all those people\nfor (and how can you a\ufb00ord that)?\nWhere\u2019s all that lean start-up approach everyone\u2019s talking about? Well,\nYPlan\u2019s founders Rytis Vitkauskas (28,\nHBS graduate and former VC) and\nViktoras Jucikas (31, former Executive Director at Goldman Sachs) were\ntaking up a very lean approach while\nthey were in ideation phase. In fact,\nyou might have met Rytis already, and\nheard him talking about\nhis journey into YPlan \u2013 in\nthe past few months, well\nbefore the launch, he was\ninvited to speak at Imperial\nCollege a number of times\n\u2013 as a keynote speaker of\nICBS Entrepreneurs Club,\nleading the very \ufb01rst workshop (topic: ideation, how\nyou can structure it, and\nhow YPlan was the idea\n51) at ICStartup (you can\nread the full article here: http://www.\nicstartup.com/news/what-did-weget-\ufb01rst-workshop/), and also participating at Silicon Valley comes to Imperial, where he was on a panel to \u2018An\nInsider\u2019s Insight: Day 1 to Scale.\u2019 Quite\na few Imperial students were among a\nsmall community of early YPlan users\nwho got access well before the launch\nand were trialling out the app while\nthe YPlan team was \ufb01ne-tuning.\nThing is, after graduating from my\ncourse, not many people got to start\ntheir own businesses or were able to\nstart working at such an early stage\nstart-up getting to see how things really happen. I remember sitting in IP\n(Intellectual Property) class thinking\nit was the most boring thing in the\nworld \u2013 guess what one of my \ufb01rst\ntasks was at YPlan? Filing a trademark!\nAnd I got pretty excited about it, too.\nThe moral of the story is, a few years\nago I was a Fine Arts graduate plagued\nwith worry on how I was actually going to make it as an artist. A\nchain of very odd and fortuitous\nevents led me to work at Songkick, then study at Imperial, and\n\ufb01nally be one of the early members of YPlan team, and so I got\nfully immersed in the exciting\nstart-up experience. I\u2019ve learned\nthat as long as you\u2019re not afraid\nto delve into the unknown and\ntake challenges head on, startup life is really the place to be.\nFrom Fine Art to the App Store\nAusrine Kersanskaite Writer\n\n"

I could write on\nand on about each of them. Like how\nwe mistook the boy Chingu for a girl\nand did not realize our folly until one\nof us noticed he was peeing standing\nup. We simply assumed he was a girl\nbecause he had long hair, but young\nboys in Mongolia are like that. They\nget their \ufb01rst haircut at the age of four.\nChingu got his a little earlier because\nwe discovered he had head lice. As\nwe cut o\ufb00 his locks with a pair of dull\nscissors, he beamed proudly, having\nentered the next symbolic stage of his\nyoung life. The other children who had\nlice reacted di\ufb00erently during their\nhaircuts. They cried and pouted, and\nno amount of candy or comfort could\nappease them.\nFor a week, we spent roughly twelve\nhours a day with these children. The\nvolunteers were sun burnt and sick\nfrom the weather, and our energy was\nexhausted. I admit I too was getting\nburnt out. I wanted to get back to the\ncapital, have a hot shower, wash my\nclothes and drink myself in to a stupor.\nIt would have to wait.\nOur last full day at the camp was\nparticularly rough. We had exhausted\nmost of our ideas for activities and\nthere was far too much free time for\nthe children to run around. Dinner\nwas poor as we were \ufb01nishing the last\nof our food.\nAfter dinner, we had a \ufb01nal meeting\nwith the kids. Stephanie had originally lied to the children that the camp\nwould continue for several more days.\nShe did it so they would not try running away, because the consensus was\nthat none of them wanted to return\nto the shelter where they were often\nbullied by others and occasionally\nmistreated. When Stephanie admitted\nthe truth the children seemed a little\ndisappointed. She quickly shifted topic\nand handed out postcards to write on.\nThese were meant as thank you letters to the many people who had given\ndonations to make the camp possible.\nNext, the children wrote comments on\na di\ufb00erent slip of paper thanking the\nvolunteers.\nThe \ufb01rst child to cry was Sahnder.\nHe dropped his head, his shoulders\nshook, and he drew in short breaths.\nA volunteer walked up and held him\nfrom behind. Others soon shed their\ntears, and the whole tent became\ndrowned in sni\ufb04es and sobs. Some\nchildren would sit in a corner and\nsob, while others would wail openly.\nThrough their choked up voices, the\nchildren said things to us. We had to\nget one of our two interpreters to repeat their words in English. Temujin\ntold me he did not want me to leave\nhim. He said he thought of me as a\nfather. I looked at him and shook my\nhead. I had my own life to get back to\nand told him as much. The words rang\ntrue for each volunteer. We could only\ngive the children so much.\nThe following morning the bus came\nto take us back to the capital. We shuf\ufb02ed in, took our seats and the engine\nstarted up. The drive back took a little\nover an hour. Green, treeless swaths of\nland gave way to muddy earth studded\nwith gers and shanty houses. Concrete\nsoon \ufb01lled in the edges of the road, and\nwe came to a stop next to the welfare\no\ufb03ce near the city center. The children\nwent in to another shuttle bus bound\nfor their shelter while we were free to\n\ufb01nd our hostel. It was a short goodbye.\nWe had given a group of street kids\nthe opportunity to enjoy things they\nwould never have had the chance to\nenjoy. It was an experience, and how\nthey choose to learn and identify with\nit will in\ufb02uence their young and impressionable lives. Perhaps that is only\nwishful thinking, but looking back I\nfeel a strong fondness for the children\nand the times we shared. For both volunteers and children, it was a crazy,\nwild and unique series of events that\nunfolded in the hills of Mongolia. And\nbeneath it all, there was the laughter,\nthe smiles and the desire to do something good and meaningful.\nFor that much I am grateful.\nInterested in volunteering for Mongolia\nSummer Camp 2013?\nContact David at weiyu.tan10@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Even\naside from speci\ufb01c conditions such as\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, poor short term\nmemory and impaired reasoning abilities can be among the problems that\ncome with older age, and for many\npeople they can be severe enough to\ninterfere with daily activities and the\nability to live independently. But there\nis mounting evidence that the risk of\ndeveloping such problems is strongly\ncorrelated with common health and\nlifestyle issues.\nAge and Aging journal recently\npublished a large cohort study by researchers at Kings College London,\nlooking speci\ufb01cally at the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive decline. Such risk\nfactors \u2013 including obesity, smoking,\nblood pressure and cholesterol levels\n\u2013 have often before been proposed as\nsigni\ufb01cant. It matters, because these\nfactors are usually modi\ufb01able: if detected early enough, we may be able\nto do something about them and prevent the damage. However, until now,\nthere were no large-scale, long-term\npopulation-based studies to con\ufb01rm\nor disprove the hypotheses. It was this\ngap that the current study aimed to\naddress.\nThe study analysed data mostly collected between 2004 and 2005, and\nmany participants also took part in\nfollow-up studies several years later.\nThis allowed researchers to track the\nprogress of physical health and cognitive variables over time. Health professionals use a standard set of tests\nto measure memory and \u2018executive\nSarah Byrne Writer\nfunction\u2019, which involves verbal \ufb02uency, attention span and mental speed.\nThese tests strangely resemble children\u2019s games: how many animals can\nyou name in one minute? How many\nof these ten words can you recall?\nNonetheless they are widely accepted\nas reliable measures of cognitive func-tioning. In this study, the researchers\nused the results to calculate a cognitive index for each participant, based\non a composite of their scores in each\nstudy, and how those scores deviate\nfrom the average.\nThe results con\ufb01rmed the suspicion\nthat the same risk factors that predispose a person to have cardiovascular\nhealth problems \u2013 stroke and coronary heart disease \u2013 also put them at\nrisk of impaired cognitive function.\nntelligence has been a hot\ntopic in robotics for decades \u2013\never since we started creating\ncomputers and machines, we\nhave wanted to imbue them\nwith a similar level of learning and intelligence to our own. So we turned to\nthe most intelligent machine we had\n\u2013 our brains. Researchers in this \ufb01eld\nhave been simulating neuron maps in\nhopes of replicating the human abili-ties. Over time, they have been getting\never-more e\ufb03cient at it; the Blue Brain\nProject was able to simulate 1 million\nneurons. The more recently created\nCognitive Computation Project was\nable to simulate 1 billion neurons, the\nsame amount as the average cat. However, an ambitious new project has\nbeen reported to simulate near the human scale of 100 billion neurons.\nWhile previous experiments only\nsought to increase computational\npower by including more neurons, the\nteam, including Chris Eliasmith, Terrence Stewart, Xuan Choo, et al., also\ntried to answer the question of how\na complex brain produces behaviour.\nThe project included many anatomical\nand physical constraints to be as close\nto the real life neural data as possible.\nA research paper, published on sci-encemag.org, shows how the team\u2019s\nmodel responds to eight di\ufb00erent\ntasks; nicknamed Spaun, the model\nis shown performing actions such as\nreading and writing a list, counting\nfrom a given number, and reading the\nposition of a given number. The input\nis given through a 28x28 image of a\ncharacter and the output is the movement of an arm \u2013 essentially, Spaun\nwrites the answer to whichever task he\nis trying to perform.\nThe \ufb01gure above shows the functional architecture used to create Spaun.\nThe bold lines are indications where\nthe brain passes information between\ndi\ufb00erent elements of the cortex, whilst\nthe thinner lines represent communication between the action selection\nBuilding a virtual brain\nSmoking emerged as a particular\nrisk, being strongly and consistently\nassociated with loss of memory and\nexecutive processing abilities at both\nthe four year and eight year follow-up\nstudies.\nInterestingly, even borderline-high\nblood pressure appeared to be correlated with loss of memory function.\nIn fact, this appeared to be a bigger\nrisk factor than very high blood pres-sure: possibly because the borderline\ncases were less likely to have been\nconsidered worth treating with pres-sure-reducing antihypertensive drugs.\nThis new \ufb01nding points to a possible\nbene\ufb01t of treating even the borderline\ncases. The good news is that the damage appears to take place slowly over\nseveral years, giving hope that early\nintervention may be able to successfully prevent it.\nThe researchers recommend using\nthese \ufb01ndings in the design of future\nclinical trials to study attempts at preventative measures, eventually leading\nto population-based interventions. It\nis becoming increasingly clear, how-ever, that there are many factors contributing to cognitive decline, and any\nsuccessful intervention will have to\ntake this into account and address the\nmultiple causes.\nDOI: 10.1093/ageing/afs166\n(equivalent to the basal ganglia) and\nthe cortex.

    "content": "SPORT\n53\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe bigger they are; Kings get smashed\nOn the very cold afternoon on\nWednesday the 5th December we\nwent out to face a team that had not\nonly beaten but really thrashed us at\nthe beginning of the season 7-0. It was\nnot an exciting prospect with a captain\nGigi having now become captain hook\nand only able to watch from the sidelines after breaking her hand a few\nweeks ago. We have also been struggling though a few injuries and were\ndepleted due to the usual end of term\ndeadlines. But we set out with nothing\nto lose; at least we looked better than\nthe mottled purple of Portsmouth!\nThe game started tentatively from\nboth teams with the possession fairly\neven and staying around the centre of\nthe pitch. With some screaming from\nthe side-line we push on running hard\nat Portsmouth and forcing them to\nmake some bad tackles giving us some\npossession in our attacking third, but\nto no avail. We had some good passes\naround the back from Celia, Kirsty,\nEmma and Maria who were able to get\nthe ball down the side-lines allowing Jules, Kirsten and Anna some close break-aways in our attack. We earned an early\nshort-cornerbutitseemsthatthenaked\nboys running around the pitch were a\ndistraction to our usual scoring duo and\nwe narrowly missed the goal. Finally we\nbroke their defence with 5 minutes to\ngo of the \ufb01rst half giving Sorcha a one-on-one opportunity against the keeper.\nTheir keeper appeared stunned and\ndidn\u2019t move as Sorcha carefully slotted\nthe ball past her giving the team a miraculous boast as we were unexpectedly\nahead! Unfortunately we hadn\u2019t been\nable to impress the crowd of Men\u2019s 3s\nwho had decided moments earlier to\nhead for showers.\nAt half-time we knew that Portsmouth would come out attacking, but\nwith our pirate spirits we took to the\npitch ready to defend all \ufb02anks. Almost\nimmediately they were on the attack\nbut one of their players literally \u2018hit-thedeck\u2019 and we had to wait for the injury\nto be sorted. The second half was a very\ntough a\ufb00air but some tight marking\nof their central mid\ufb01eld by Hazman\nand fresher Bryony and fresher Hayley took their main strengths out of\nthe game. Some insane interceptions\nfrom Celia led to a give-and-go run all\nthe way down the pitch with Sorcha\nsupporting and our resident peg-leg\n(Celia) almost scoring a fantastic goal\nfrom her sweeper position! Needless to\nsay we needed her in defence and she\nreally battled though pain to hold of\ndefending unit together for the rest of\nthe game. We were undoubtedly on the\nback foot with a relentless attack from\nthe Portsmouth girls. The voices on the\nside-lines were getting higher and higher as 3 successive goal lines saves were\nmade by Emma and Bryony. Thanks to\nour very own Will Turner-goalkeeper\nPurcy was saving us all with her continuous clearances, preventing our ship\nfrom sinking!\nOur defence managed to hold out\nuntil the \ufb01nal whistle when we realised that we had won! The entire team\nplayed amazingly and all the girls\nshould be so proud of the achievement.\nThis was one of the best team performances we\u2019ve had this year and just\nshows the distance we have come over\nthe past few months! There were some\nvery merry pirates celebrating in the\nunion later. Hopefully we can carry this\nspirit into next term with the return of\nour captain.\nICHC Womens 1s win against all odds\nSorcha Cotter Sports Editor\nJonnie Clowes\nHockey HonarySecretary\nMany of you may have read the article\nwritten by the Hockey Club Captain\nlast week referencing the email written to the Imperial 2s captain by the\nKCL 1s captain. The email undoubtedly\nshowed unsportsmanlike behaviour on\nthe part of the KCL captain but also\ngave the 2s even more motivation to go\nout there and show KCL exactly what\nthey are made of.\nThe task ahead of the 2s was undoubtedly a daunting one. KCL 1s are 3 BUCs\nleagues above them, pushing for the\nLUSL Premier Division title and were\ncoming o\ufb00 the back of a 4-0 victory\nover IC 1s, but therein lies the beauty of\nthe cup. The chance for the underdogs\nto shine, pull o\ufb00 that great upset, win\nagainst all the odds and, above all else,\nenjoy playing the sport they love on a\ngrand stage. Each and every player in\nthe 2s team knew what the game meant.\nWin, and they had pulled o\ufb00 the biggest\ncup upset of the year so far, lose, and\nthey could hold their heads up high and\nsay they gave it their all.\nThe pre-match warm up was unfortunately non-existent due to a frozen\npitch and late location change but the\nrousing pre-match speech delivered\nby injured captain Jimmy S was all the\nwarm up the boys needed. With keeper\nSifter still putting on his helmet and\ngloves, the umpires started the game.\nInstantly KCL 1s were on the attack\nand looking to put the game to bed\nearly. Barely having adjusted his helmet,\nSifter was called into action after some\nslack defending with a smart save at his\nnear post. If the 2s didn\u2019t know they\nwere in for a tough match beforehand,\nthey did now.\nUndaunted by their slow start, the\n2s got to work at what they do best.\nSimple yet e\ufb00ective passing moves began to unlock the KCL defence. Every\nplayer on the pitch was happy to receive the ball under pressure knowing\nthat a teammate was there to receive\nthe next pass. The 2s \ufb02uid style of play\nsoon gave them their \ufb01rst opportunity.\nA quick free hit taken by B. Tablet at the\nback gave Fresher Alex space to run at\nthe KCL defence. After skinning two\nplayers he pulled the ball back for the\non rushing Tinkerbell, again playing\nin his unique position of creative centre back. A square ball found the ever\nreliable Strap-On on the left \ufb02ank who\ndelivered a peach of a ball into the KCL\ncircle met by Fresher Tim, running at\nfull pace, for a \ufb01rst time shot that was\ntipped over the cross bar.\nWith the KCL defence looking rat-tled, IC pushed on. Strikers Brickney\nand Fresher Jay-Zed were full of running upfront giving the KCL defenders\na torrid time tracking them. Cummy B\nwas creative as the attacking mid\ufb01elder\nknowing that Old Man Mikey was behind him to mop up any loose ball that\nshould come his way. However the KCL\nteam still looked dangerous going forward and the IC defence had to be on\ntheir toes. What happened next was\nde\ufb01nitely not in the KCL script.\nIC centre back, Soggy, decided he\nhad had enough of marking his man\n(which he doesn\u2019t like doing at the best\nof times) and stepped in front to cut out\na dangerous through ball. He played a\npeach of a pass out wide to Meat Spin\nwho played a deft one-two with Y.Bag\nbefore winning a penalty corner. Cummy B received the ball at the top of the\ncircle, drew two defenders before playing an under arm pass to Fresher Tim\nwho smashed the ball home into the far\ncorner of the goal. The IC players went\nmad celebrating and, still buzzing from\ntheir moment of glory, nearly allowed\nKCL to hit straight back.\nPoor defending allowed the KCL\nstriker a free shot from less than 6\nyards. Goalie, Sifter, rushed out to\nsmother the initial shot before jumping\nback to his feet and diving right to keep\nout the rebound. Two further rebounds\nfollowed with the \ufb01rst being blocked by\nthe keepers out stretched stick and the\nlatter beaten away by his outstretched\nhand. The ball eventually found its\nway to a KCL player no more than 3\nyards from an open goal only for him\nto inexplicably play the ball millimetres\nwide of the post. This was the shock\nto the system that IC needed and they\nstepped up their game to see o\ufb00 the rest\nof the half with no major scares.\nAt the start of the second half, KCL\ncame out with a renewed vigour. They\npushed forwards looking for the equal-iser and no more than 5 minutes into\nthe second half they nearly had it. Slick\nplay down the right hand side say a\ncross whipped in leaving an unmarked\nplayer to slot the ball home. However,\nIC protested that the ball had come o\ufb00\nthe player\u2019s foot but with the umpire\nunsighted he was unable to make a\ncall. Then followed a display of sportsmanship not previously shown by\nKCL; when questioned by the umpire,\nthe KCL striker admitted that he had\nkicked the ball in. That was the second\nlet o\ufb00 for IC and they were determined\nthat they wouldn\u2019t need a third.\nHitting KCL on the counter attack\nfrom a short corner that was magni\ufb01cently blocked by Soggy, IC won a short\ncorner of their own. The corner routine broke down but the ball eventually\nfound its way to Y.Bag who played a\ndangerous ball in that was de\ufb02ected in\nby a KCL defender. Not wanting to sit\non their two goal lead, IC grew in con\ufb01dence and began to push KCl deeper\nand deeper into their own half. Several\nchances fell to IC players with Strap-On\none of many players guilty of poor \ufb01nishing.\nKCL had put 3 past the IC 1s in the\nlast 10 minutes of the game the previous week and so IC knew the threat that\nthey still posed. KCL decided to have\none last roll of the dice and pushed men\nforwards. A rocket of a ball was played\nstraight through the heart of the IC\ndefence only for the IC keeper to once\nagain be on hand to make a double save.\nKCL\u2019s frustration began to tell and, after\nnumerous o\ufb00ences, they went down to\nten men after a player was sent o\ufb00 for\nrepeated stick tackles. This spelt the\nend of any threat they still posed to the\nIC clean sheet.\nAt the \ufb01nal whistle the IC players\nwere elated at avenging the IC 1s loss;\nthe KCL team were shell shocked by\ntheir 2-0 defeat. The biggest cup upset\nof the year so far had just occurred, I\nsay so far as IC 2s face UCL 1s in the\nquarter \ufb01nals next term. So to echo\nthe words of the ICHC Club Captain,\nwhether it be in the league or the cup,\njust remember, the bigger they are, the\nharder they fall.\nHockey man love. Standard\nPirate Hockey. Wtf.\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nLooking Beyond Binary\nFiona Hartley explores a refreshingly different anthology\npeculative \ufb01ction, that\nhard-to-de\ufb01ne genre that\nencompasses everything\nfrom science \ufb01ction to\nalternate histories, is all\nabout the fantastical, the what-ifs. It is\nall about imagination. It\u2019s a genre that\nchallenges the reality that we live in,\ndreaming of and exploring new ideas\nabout society. Stories exploring gen-der-identity, therefore, are perfect for\nsuch a genre.\nBeyond Binary is an anthology of\nseventeen stories, edited by Brit Mandelo, that have little in common aside\nfrom them all exploring how their\ncharacters de\ufb01ne their gender identi-ty. It\u2019s 256 pages of enjoyable thought-provoking \ufb01ction and wonderfully designed to boot.\nWhen I \ufb01rst read a review of Beyond Binary, I did so as someone who\nknows very little about challenging\ngender identity. I am still that now,\nfeeling that I\u2019m somehow unquali\ufb01ed\nto tell you about genderqueer \ufb01ction\nwhen I am a cissexual woman and at\nease being that way. I didn\u2019t know that\nI wanted to read something like this.\nBut perusing that review, I suddenly\ndiscovered in myself the desire to read\nthis thing beyond my realm of experi-ence.\nI\u2019d never read a book like this one.\nI enjoyed the sci-\ufb01, the fantasy, the\nstories in between, and I loved the fact\nthat it was queer. Yes, I am biased, and\nperhaps that might make my opinion\nless valid. But Beyond Binary is just\nrefreshingly di\ufb00erent. Even now every\nstory makes me think about the world\nwe live in, and those stories that I\u2019m\nnot as keen on still leave me with some\ninteresting imagery or an absorbing\nconcept.\nThis is a fascinating anthology, and\nimportant because it succeeds in\nbreaking the heteronormative mould\nthat permeates \ufb01ction. But it is in no\nway perfect, and that\u2019s not just because it\u2019s an anthology \u2013 meaning that\nthe likelihood of one loving every single story is low. For a book that promises to go beyond the gender binary,\nthere are very few genderqueer char-acters; not every story is as fantastical\nas I would have liked, although given\nthe broad nature of the speculative\ngenre I\u2019ve come to the conclusion they\nall \ufb01t in somehow.\nTake one of my favourites, \u2018Another\nComing\u2019 by Sonya Taa\ufb00e. It\u2019s a fabulous little bisexual story about the parentage of an unwanted child conceived\nin a poly relationship. But that doesn\u2019t\nmake it genderqueer. Richard Larson\u2019s\n\u2018The Ghost Party\u2019 is a menacing piece\nabout a ghostly rave, but aside from\nthe party its main character Charlee is\nbasically dealing with her attraction to\nanother girl \u2013 again, not particularly\nchallenging to the gender binary, in\nmy opinion anyway.\nSince this is an anthology there\u2019s\nsomething for everyone. My favourites include Kelley Eskridge\u2019s novelette \u2018Eye of the Storm\u2019, which is so\ngood that I will simply recommend\nyou read it, regardless of whether you\ndo that by buying this book or one of\nthe author\u2019s other collections. Keyan\nBowes explores the concept of parents being able to choose the gender\nof their child and what might happen\nif their child disagrees with that choice\nin the story \u2018Spoiling Veena\u2019. \u2018Sex with\nGhosts\u2019 features an asexual narrator\ncoming face-to-face with her doppel-ganger, who is a customised sexbot\nmade by her sleazy boss for the pleasure of brothel clients.\nEqually the nature of an anthology\nmeans you probably won\u2019t be a fan\nof every single story you read. For in-stance, I struggle with the Caribbean\ndialect in Nalo Hopkinson\u2019s \u2018Fisherman\u2019 and usually skip it, but most reviewers call it one of the best stories\nin the collection. I originally disliked\n\u2018Pirate Solutions\u2019 by Katherine Sparrow, which is about a group of computer hackers who drink special rum\nthat turns them into pirates, or they\nre-inhabit their past lives as pirates\nbecause of the rum, or something.\nSomehow the tale has grown on me\nprecisely because I don\u2019t understand\nit, so I read it fairly often, unable to get\nthe imagery out of my head.\nOn re\ufb02ection, this collection doesn\u2019t\nalways live up to its title. But I think\nI could have done worse for an introduction to queer \ufb01ction. The stories\nare solid and enthralling. You might\nnot know that you want to read this,\njust as I didn\u2019t. But I hope that I\u2019ve\nencouraged you to think about stepping beyond the boundaries of what\nyou normally read by telling you that\nthis anthology exists. Try it. You might\n\ufb01nd Beyond Binary to be one of the\nmost interesting things you\u2019ve ever\nread.\nS\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\nwas \ufb01rst published in 1813. It hardly\nbelongs on the latest bestsellers chart\nso why have I landed on this book,\nnow? A few reasons. One, it\u2019s one of\nthose classic books that you always\npromise yourself that you\u2019ll read (but\nnever do). Indeed, I\u2019ve put o\ufb00 reading this book for nearly two hundred\nyears. Two, my girlfriend adores Austen and I wanted to know what all the\nfuss with this chick-lit is. So, in total,\na milieu of self-improving and self-motivated reasons.\n\u201cIt is a truth universally acknowl-edged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune must be in want of\na wife.\u201d Yes, yes, we all know how it\ngoes. The book details the fortunes of\nthe Bennet family of Longbourne, focusing on Elizabeth, the second eldest\ndaughter. Through a burgeoning mutual attraction between her elder sis-ter, Jane, and Mr Bingley, an eligible\nbachelor new to the neighbourhood,\nshe is introduced to the aloof and\nproud Mr Darcy.\nFinding him intolerable (and him\n\ufb01nding her wilful and uncivil), she\ndeclares an immediate dislike of him.\nHowever, over time, as their social\ncircles intersect and interact, they\n\ufb01nd that they\u2019re feelings and impressions begin to change.\nBut we all knew that already, right?\nAdmittedly, I was ignorant on a few\nof the details.\nThe writing is complex and irritating in places. If I submitted this as an\nEnglish assignment, there would be\nred pen all across the page. Austen\nis guilty of double negatives, overly\nlong sentences and speech unchained\nto characters. However, I can\u2019t tell if\nthat is how people used to talk back\nthen, how people of their class used\nto speak or a peccadillo of Austen\nherself. I sense the di\ufb00erence of two\nhundred years at work here.\nHowever, despite my frustration\nat the over-complicated address, the\nbook is still highly engaging. I don\u2019t\nknow if I could call it pacy, as, for the\nmajority, the characters rotate between a series of balls, dinners and\ntravel. Life was hard back then, cer-tainly!\nIf the previous few chapters have\nbeen spent on reactions to the last\nevent or revelations, it\u2019s a fair bet that\nthe next chapter will include a letter\nto further the plot.\nThis is chick-lit but it is exquisite chick-lit. In fact, it is archetypal\nchick-lit. The strong-willed female\nprotagonist? Check. The handsome\nyet broody love interest? Check. The\n\u201cWill they? Won\u2019t they?\u201d question\nthat hovers around for the best part\nof 300 pages? Check. Everything else\nis detail. If you\u2019re in any doubt, check\nout Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary.\nBut could someone please explain\nthe point of Mary Bennet?\nAfter this, I feel more tolerant of\nchick-lit but this could still have been\nhelped a little more plain English. It\u2019s\na classic and part of the English canon\nfor good reason. More than that, it\u2019s\npart of our popular culture and it is\nalways so much more satisfying when\nyou know why. It also helps to be a little bit more interesting at dinner par-ties.\nAs a \ufb01tting tribute to the 200th anniversary of the book, ICSM Drama\nwill be performing a stage adaptation\nof Pride and Prejudice next March.\nAuditions will be held next week. 12-5pm, Sunday 9th, 2-5pm, Wednesday 12th, 6-9pm, Tuesday 11th and\nThursday 13th in the Glenister build-ing, Charing Cross campus. Auditions\non Monday 10th will be in the Sir Alexander Fleming building, room 121,\n6-9pm. For more details, please contact as2708@ic.ac.uk.\nLooking back at Pride and Prejudice\nRhys Davies Writer\n\n"

With the strong\nsupport of the best bowlers in London, Matt Miller and Mike Quarry,\nthe Imperial team is getting well-pre-pared as we make our way to our \ufb01rst\never tournament \ufb01nals, which will be\nagainst She\ufb03eld, Loughborough and\nthe winner from the group stage.\n\u2018It has been a historical moment for\nthe Imperial team to enter the \ufb01nals\nfor the very \ufb01rst time.\u2019 Team Captain\nKelvin Wong said, \u2018Every member of\nmy team has put their full e\ufb00ort into\nbowling. I have a lot of faith in them\nto once again be outstanding in the\n\ufb01nals.\u2019\nIn the same month, Imperial Trios\nhosted the \ufb01rst Order of Merit tournament organised by Imperial, Romford,\nNorth-East London.

The bright sunshine was\ndeceptive: it did nothing but produce\nglare on the pitch. Layering and sunglasses were key in equal measure.\nThe match kicked o\ufb00 with fresher\nLexi Wisentaner in centre. Her \ufb01rst\ndraw went straight to teammate Oli\nMorley, who ran it down the pitch\ntowards the Reading goal. In rapid\nsuccession, the \ufb01rst three goals were\nscored by Liv Sinclair, Captain Lizzie\nAllen and Oli Morley, with shots on\ngoal by Cat Hedley and Lexi. Very\nsoon though it was the turn of Imperial\u2019s defensive side to be put to\nthe test and by the end of the quarter Reading had equalised: the score\nstanding at 3-3.\nFor the 2nd quarter, Imperial tightened up its defence. Players Abi\nMurugesh-Warren and Bex Singh\ndouble-teamed their Reading player\nto regain possession of the ball. Lexi\ntransported the ball down the pitch,\nbarging past many a defender, and\nafter some settle play around the fan,\nImo Simmonds scored goal number\nfour. Hannah Brooks and Lydia Uden\ndoubled dangerous number 10, releasing the ball for Rachel Castola\nto recover and pass to goalie Gaby\nPrager for the clear. Bex took the\nball up the wing and by half-time, a\nfurther two goals by Oli Morley had\nbrought the score up to 6-3.\nHuddling close in half-time the\nImperial side reviewed their situa-tion. Defence had not conceded a\ngoal in the previous quarter, and the\ndouble-team technique was deemed\ne\ufb00ective. On the attacking side, in\naddition to six successful goals, several failed shots on goal had been\nmade. Captain Lizzie Allen stressed\nthe importance of making decisive\ncuts through the fan, and that the \ufb01nal pass before shooting be safe and\neasily converted.\nSeconds after the whistle had been\nblown in the third quarter, Imo Simmonds scored her second goal of\nthe match. Shortly after however,\nReading gained and held possession,\nworking the fan around goalkeeper\nGaby Prager. Our goalkeeper and defenders withstood the pressure, and\nwhen the ball \ufb01nally turned back over\nto Imperial, Abi Murugesh-Warren\nrapidly took the 8th goal. Moments\nSavvy Stickwork Spells Victory for Lacrosse\nHannah Tullett 2nd Team VC\nlater, some impressive team-play\ngave Imperial the edge: Imo took the\nball behind the Reading goal, Lydia\nUden made a cut in front, and scored\no\ufb00 a quick-sticks pass. Clearly under\npressure, the Reading side made a\nfoul stick swipe to Imo\u2019s head. Knees\nbent and eyes focused on the goal,\nImo took the free ball at the head of\nthe fan. The ball hit its mark in the\nback of the net and a whistle promptly signalled the quarter.\nFourth and \ufb01nal quarter and Imperial acknowledged that Reading were\nfeeling the pressure. Stick checks\nwere becoming dodgy, but our policy\nwas to keep our play clean. Defender\nShosh Krasner-Macleod in regaining\nball possession took a swipe to the\nface, but undeterred, she played on,\nleading to Abi scoring goals 14 and\n15. Playing up from the Imperial lacrosse 2\u2019s, Hannah Tullett stuck close\nto her Reading player and again, no\ngoals were conceded during this \ufb01nal\nquarter. Imo scored three goals and\nOli one in the last quarter, producing\nan impressive \ufb01nal score of 16-4.\nWednesday was not the \ufb01rst time\nImperial had met Reading, and it\nwas admitted that their side had improved immensely. It took an equal-ised \ufb01rst quarter to prompt the Imperial side to really up their game and\nmake use of some stunning tactics.\nThis result in the \ufb01nal match of term\nwas a testament to the hard work of\nCaptain Lizzie Allen and Vice Imo\nSimmonds, and the invaluable team\nwork the Imperial ladies have used to\ntake them up to second place in the\nleague. The team look ahead to next\nterm, to continue and expand upon\ntheir e\ufb00orts, and where a hoped-for\nvictory against Royal Holloway will\ntake them to the top.\nMan-of-the-match, awarded both\nby Reading and Imperial, went to\nImo Simmonds. Dick-of-the-day was\nalso awarded to the Vice Captain,\nwhen it was noted in a moment of\nheated match play that she had managed to hit herself in the head with\nher own stick. Three shots later, it\nis needless to say that she was a fair\nbit woozy on that long minibus ride\nhome\u2026\nPinheads\nSee the pervert behind\nthem?\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nsis as they vote the \ufb01rst chamber, there\nwould be an element of redundancy in\nthe process. So it\u2019s a case of strengthening what it currently does. Some\nof that can be achieved by the House\nitself without legislation, and we\u2019ve already strengthened our resources over\nthe years and we continue to do it. We\nare looking at a lot of our procedures;\n[to] see how those could be strength-ened. We\u2019ve made some changes [and]\nwe\u2019re discussing more. Also, enhancing our use of specialist committees,\nI want to see more evidence taking in\ndealing with legislation. But a number\nof changes require legislation \u2013 putting the Appointments Commission\non a statutory basis, getting rid of\nthe by-election of hereditary peers\nmaking them de facto Life Peers. We\nwant to have provision for expulsion\nof some members, particularly if they\nhave committed serious criminal of-fences, so to bring us into line with\nthe procedures and rules of the Commons, but also, if necessary, to be able\nto expel members. I\u2019d like to see a cap\non the numbers as well (we\u2019re quite a\nlarge chamber), and make provision\nfor those who don\u2019t attend, or have\nmore direct methods to reduce the\nnumber of members. Those changes, I\nthink, would enhance what the House\ndoes. I think what it does, it does well;\nparticularly, legislative scrutiny, the\ndi\ufb00erence it makes there to legislation,\nbut you must never be complacent in\nwhat we do well, we could do even\nbetter. So I think we need changes,\nand that\u2019s what we\u2019re exploring at the\nmoment.\nAM: Frequently, over the last decade\nor so, there has been considerable\nappetite for constitutional reform,\nrecently the Fixed Term Parliament\nAct, and with the last Government,\nthe abolition of the Law Lords and\nexpulsion of the majority of the hereditary peers. Does this illustrate\nthe dominance of the executive, and\nas such, were proposals properly\nscrutinised? If not how would you\nprevent that from occurring again?\nLN: Well, to some extent they were,\nit depends on political will, but part\nof the problem is the government\nitself not fully appreciating the nature of constitutional change and\nthat it should be subject to a somewhat di\ufb00erent procedure than that\nfor ordinary legislation. Getting the\ngovernment to accept this is proving\ndi\ufb03cult, but what they\u2019ve got to accept is that the constitution is bigger\nthan the government. That is [to say\nthat] government is the creature of\nthe constitution and not the other way\nround. So they need to accept more\nthat the Lords ful\ufb01l quite a good role,\nultimately it\u2019s up to the Commons, but\nthe Lords have been able to make a\ndi\ufb00erence because of the scrutiny that\nis a\ufb00orded, both when the legislation\nis going through, and through its committee work. The Constitution Committee in the House of Lords has been\nvery in\ufb02uential in terms of the reports\nit has been producing on some of the\nchanges going through, and achieving some change and in\ufb02uencing the\nHouse on the stance it takes on them.\nFixed Term Parliaments, a particular success in the last session on the\nPublic Bodies Bill, which was changed\nquite dramatically in light of the work\nwe did. So the Lords does quite a good\njob in that respect, but we are working hard to get the government to en-hance, to look at the way it deals with\nconstitutional measures and accept\nthey are qualitatively distinctive and\nneeds to be treated as such.\nAM: I have a couple of questions\nfrom our readers. The \ufb01rst one I\nhave is aside from how one would\nget your job, if you could draw up a\nconstitution based on three princi-ples, what would they be?\nLN: I\u2019m a bit wary of having a codi\ufb01ed constitution and therefore \u2026 it\ndepends on principles. I can tell you\nabout the basic tenets, in terms of\nform, but that would be to keep what\nwe\u2019ve got. Given the nature of our\nconstitution, where we tend to go for\nwhat is known as positive constitu-tionalism, rather than like the States,\nwhich goes for negative constitution-alism. That is where there are certain\nprinciples, which take precedence,\npolitical principles that transcend all\nof the majority. We go somewhat towards the other end where the will of\nthe majority will prevail, but tempered\nby Parliament and that\u2019s important.\nSo, the three principles. One would\nretain the principle of Parliamentary\nGovernment, of government being\nchosen through the House of Commons and being answerable. That\ncomes onto the second principle,\nwhich is accountability. To add to the\ncore principle, accountability, which\nthe present system delivers because\nwe have core accountability through\nelections to the House of Commons.\nGovernments are chosen through\nelections to the House of Commons,\nand are answerable through elections\nto the House of Commons. That is\nfundamental. In this country, we know\nwho is responsible for public policy,\nin a way that American citizens can\u2019t\nalways identify who\u2019s responsible for\nAmerican public policy. What if Congress overturns what the President\nwants? There\u2019s the question of ac-countability. So, Parliamentary Government, or if you like, Parliamentary\nAccountability. Now\u2026 choice as to\nwhat would come next in our\u2026 ar-rangement. Because one could go with\nthe principle of maintaining a Union\nstate, that\u2019d possibly be one, where it is\nstrengths from each part of the Union\ncoming together, thus within a unitary\nstate. So, I suppose those are the main\nones, and an ancillary to core accountability of course, is maintaining the\nprimacy of one legislature, having an\nelected chamber, which is necessary in\ndemocracy and su\ufb03cient.\nAM: Another question was whether\nthe omnipotence of the \ufb01fty per\ncent plus one majority is a weakness\nof British Democracy?\nLN: No. There are all sorts of problems with supermajorities under our\nsystem, because they can be amended\nby legislation anyway, which would\nneed an ordinary majority. No, I don\u2019t\nthink there is a problem in our system,\nbecause there is core accountabil-ity, as I say, the government\u2019s elected\nthrough an elected House of Commons, and is answerable to the elected\nCommons. In other words, the government knows it can be turned out\nat the next election, so even if it did\njust win with \ufb01fty per cent plus one,\nit knows it won\u2019t be normally able to\nengage in political musical chairs after\nthe next election, as some systems can.\nIt\u2019s that aspect which makes Government therefore responsive in between\nelections, which is another value to\nthe system. So it\u2019s not, it tempers the\narrogance of governments: if it ignores what the public think between\nelections, it\u2019s going to lose the next\nelection. So it is tempered by that.\nSo I think the way it comes together\nis, when you think about it, you have\ncore accountability, you have e\ufb00ectiveness because the government can\ngovern. It can deliver on the coherent\nprogramme of public policy, but it is\nalso responsive between elections. It\nknows it wants to win the next elec-tion. And members of both Houses\nare more independent than they used\nto be \u2013 certainly the Commons \u2013 MPs\n[are] more willing to vote against their\nown side. So it tends to come together.\nYou have accountability, e\ufb00ectiveness,\nresponsiveness, in a way that few other systems have.\nAM: Thank you for your time, Lord\nNorton.\nLN: Thank you.\nGuest talk:\nLord Norton\n11th December at 7pm\nRoom G.01, RSM\nFree for Imperial students\nBrought to you by Conservative, Debating, and History\nsocieties.\nI want it\n[Lords] to be\neffective but\nnot elective\nWouldn\u2019t mind the people that did this\nto redo my room in halls actually.

    "content": "ately, the horror genre\nhas experienced a surge\nof interest with TV-series such as The Walking\nDead and my personal\nfavourite American Horror Story. The\nlatter is truly a breath of fresh air in\nyour weekly TV-schedule and the end\nof its second season is approaching\nfast! This show has received high appraisal by many TV \u2013 critics thanks to\nits high originality and accredited cast.\nPersonally, I am mostly impressed by\nhow it manages to transform gory,\nsuspenseful and physiological horror\ninto rather cheerful entertainment.\nBut considering this show is brought\nto you by the co-creators of Glee, the\ngleeful twist is perhaps not too surprising after all. Don\u2019t worry though,\nthis TV-series is completely free from\nhappy tunes and annoying teenagers\nplayed by 28+ year old actors.\nThe \ufb01rst season sets o\ufb00 as a family of\nthree moves into a wonderful chateau\nin sunny California. They were at least\nnoti\ufb01ed that the house has a murderous past but little did they know that it\nalso has dozens of otherworldly dwell-ers... or that occupiers rarely make it\nout alive or out of this world. One episode at a time, the history of the house\nunravels and you begin to understand\nwhy this haunted building has become\nthe major attraction of a murder bus\nL\nTELEVISION\nTelevision Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nA Glee-ful Screamfest\nAstrid Armgarth gives American Horror Story: Asylum a raving review\ntour that passes by on a daily basis to\nrevel in the unfortunate fates of past\nresidents. The halls are crawling with\nboth murder victims (a gay couple,\nnurses and creepy children) and murderers (a high-school shooter, a doctor\nand a dentist). Meanwhile, the family\nis on the brink of destruction, with\nserious neglect of their suicidal teenage daughter and a marriage cracking\nat the seams by adultery. As puzzle\npieces slowly fall into place the viewers become increasingly attached to\nthe living as well as the dead.\nThe second season brings on a new\ntheme of horror that takes place in an\ninsane asylum (Briarcli\ufb00) in the 1960s.\nThis institution is run by iron \ufb01sts of\na nun (Sister Jude) that carries a past\nof alcoholism and tragedy. And as they\nsay: bad habits die hard, and people\nfrom the ward seem to be dropping\nlike \ufb02ies. Many of these deaths are\nattributed to the asylum\u2019s experimental medic Dr. Arden who transforms\nthese poor souls into deformed crea-tures. I should probably mention that\nhe also used to serve as an SS o\ufb03cer\nback in the day. By his side is the gullible and loyal Sister Mary Eunice who\nbecomes possessed by the devil halfway through the season. In addition,\none of the inmates has been committed on the basis of false murder ac-cusations, while the real \u2018bloody face\u2019\nkiller is still on the loose. This nickname was picked up from his passion\nfor carving o\ufb00 the faces of his victims\nto wear them as masks (or make pretty\nlamp-shades).\nYes, the second season does sound\ndrastically wackier than the \ufb01rst (and\nI did not even mention the aliens). But\nregardless of its extreme oddities the\namazing cast makes it virtually impossible to stop watching this show.\nSome actors are re-occurring in both\nseasons due to their phenomenal per-formances. The fact that they are portraying completely di\ufb00erent roles in\nthe two seasons strengthens the proof\nof their theatrical aptitude.\nThe top three cast members to\nkeep an eye on include: Jessica Lange,\nZachary Quinto aka Heroes\u2019 Sylar and\nEvan \u2018Kickass\u2019 Peters. Jessica Lange\nwon an Emmy award for her outstanding supporting role as the nosy next-door neighbour Constance in season\none. Her portrayal of the drunkard\nSister Jude this season is on par with\nher previous performance, so who\nknows what prizes await her? Zachary Quinto is constantly associated\nwith psychopathic tendencies ever\nsince his brilliant enactment of mass\nmurderer Sylar on Heroes. But, im-pressively, he shows no signs of inclination towards evil in the \ufb01rst season,\nwhere he plays the role of the kind and\nslightly depressed, gay ghost Chad. In\nthis season he portrays a psychologist,\nDr. Threadson, who happens to have\nsevere deep-rooted mummy issues.\nEvan Peters\u2019 performance in the \ufb01rst\nseason is excellent as a high-school\nshooter (Tate) who falls in love with\nthe suicidal daughter. He continues\nto do a good job in this season as the\nwrongly accused asylum inmate Kit.\nThere are no other horror shows that\ncan match the acting performances,\ndepth of characters and intricate plots\nin American Horror Story. I cannot\nwait to unravel the remaining mysteries of season two. I heard rumours that\nBriarcli\ufb00 gets an especially festive visit\nby a Santa dressed killer, so see the\nshow to get in the Christmas spirit!\nInterested in writing for\nSend your reviews to :\ntvfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nSo much drama in the workplace...\n\n"

This\ncomes after meeting the required\nstandard from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business\n(AACSB).\nThe Business school is now in\nthe top 1% of business schools in\nthe world to have triple accreditation from the largest and in\ufb02uential\nbusiness school accreditation asso-ciations. These associations are the\nAMBA (Association of MBAs), EQUIS (European Quality Improvement\nSystem) and now the AACSB.\nProfessor Dorothy Gri\ufb03ths, Acting Principal for the Business School,\nsaid: \u201cWe are delighted with today\u2019s\nannouncement that con\ufb01rms our\nposition as a world-leading Business\nSchool. Our programmes combine\nthe highest academic standards with\nthe very latest business practices. By\nvirtue of our unique position in Imperial College London, we are able to\ncollaborate with world-class experts\nin science, engineering, technology\nand healthcare, to ensure that our research has real impact and in\ufb02uence\nin business and government, as well as\nengaging the wider public.\u201d\nThe AACSB international accreditation is achieved after the AACSB sta\ufb00\nundertakes a meticulous review of\nthe business courses, which can take\nyears to complete. There are 21 quality standards that must be met. The\ncriteria relates to faculty, resources,\nthe communication between sta\ufb00 and\nstudents, and the demonstration of a\ncommitment of continuous improvement of the programmes.\nFactors mentioned in the business\nschool review report include: the high\nquality faculty and sta\ufb00, the commitment to excellence, the strong research environment and the supportive culture. The review also states that\nthe applied, practical nature of the\nprogrammes is valued by students.\nThe President and CEO of AACSB\nInternational commented as follows:\n\u201cWe warmly congratulate Imperial\nCollege Business School and welcome\nit into the AACSB family of internationally accredited business schools.\nAACSB accreditation represents the\nhighest achievement for an educational institution and its college of\nbusiness. The Principal, faculty, directors and administrative sta\ufb00 of the\nBusiness School are to be commended\nfor their dedication and commitment\nto continuous improvement, and for\ntheir role in earning initial accreditation.\u201d\nAn international response\nMaciej Matuszewski Reporter\nConcerns have been raised about\nthe high fees that Imperial charges\ninternational students. The average\n(excluding medicine) yearly undergraduate international fee is over\n\u00a324000. This is greater than most UK\nother UK universities \u2013 UCL charges\n\u00a318500 a year for laboratory based\nsubjects while Kings charges \u00a317800.\nThe fees, however, are one par with\nOxbridge, once their additional College fees are taken into account, and\nthe most prestigious US universities \u2013\nMIT asks students for $40732, equivalent to about \u00a325580.\nFen Wong, a Chemical Engineering\nstudent whose course costs \u00a324500\na year, told Felix that she \u201cde\ufb01nitely\nthink we\u2019re being overcharged\u201d. She\nsaid that while she has \u201caccess to the\npilot plant, which is supposed to be a\nhuge deal and a great learning experience\u201d and while she maintains that\n\u201cImperial is a good university, if not\nin terms of student satisfaction, then\nin terms of education\u201d she thinks that\nthe College \u201cwould need gold-plated\nfurniture and a butler to carry my\nbags around in order for the fees to\nbe worth it\u201d. Another Chemical Engineer, \ufb01rst year David Leng, added\nthat Imperial was \u201cthe most expensive\nUniversity in the UK\u201d that he\u2019s seen\nand that while he believes that it \u201cis\nof good quality\u201d its \u201cstill a bit too expensive\u201d.\nSecond year Aeronautical Engineering student Quraisyia Talib-Merican\nwent further, questioning whether\nthe College provides good enough facilities for the amount that it charges:\n\u201cMy course costs \u00a324000 in Imperial. It costs \u00a313000 in City [Univer-sity Lond]. Compared both courses;\npretty much the same [and] City has\nbetter facilities.\u201d\nWinston Barry Lee concurred, say-ing: \u201cI think we are overcharged. It is\na shame that Imperial treats overseas\nstudents as some sort of \ufb01xed source\nof income because they know that\noverseas students value the Imperial\nbrand. Imperial is very inaccessible to\nthose who have academic merits, but\nnot the means.\u201c\nNot all international students, how-ever, believe that the College charges\nan excessive amount. Emmilyn Yeoh,\na \ufb01rst year Materials student told Felix\nthat she didn\u2019t \u201cmind if we pay slightly\nmore than other people (like maybe\n18-19k or something) for the facilities,\nlocation and stu\ufb00.\u201d Another student,\nwho wished to remain anonymous\nurged those who think the fees are too\nhigh to consider the many additional\nresources provided in and around\nCollege, saying: \u201cGo hog library, bother tutors, careers fairs come to your\ndoorstep, take advantage of all of this!\nLondon is so central, such a fantastic\nenvironment to work and play and\nlive in. For those who want to learn\nmore there are ample libraries, muse-ums, landmarks and all of it is steeped\nin history.\u201d\nWhile opinion about the fees remains divided it seems unlikely that\nthe College is set to cut down on such\na lucrative income source any time\nsoon.\nGrantham says\nscientists should be\nmore vocal\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nImperial College London\nJeremy Grantham, who, through the\nGrantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, funds\nthe Grantham Reasearch Institute on\nClimate Change (of which there is one\nin Imperial) has written for Nature\nsaying that scientists should \u201cBe per-suasive. Be brave. Be arrested (if necessary)\u201d. He wanted scientists to speak\nout forcefully over issues that concern\nglobal warming. He argued that there\nwas a resource crisis coming and that\nmore scientists need to speak out\nabout climate change. In the opinion\npiece for Nature he said: \u201cIt is crucial\nthat scientists sound a more realistic,\nmore desperate, note on global warning\u201d. In the article he also discusses\neconomic issues such as food prices.\nHe ended with: \u201cThis is not only the\ncrisis of your lives \u2013 it is also the crisis\nof our species\u2019 existence.

    "content": "Wii wish U a merry Zmas\nMax Eggl details his discoveries at the Gadget Show Live!\nhe Wii U was released\nabout a week ago, with\na lot of curiosity surrounding its release,\nand I had the chance,\nlast Friday, to actually play it! A trip\nto the Gadget Show Live, with very\nplain press passes, allowed me to not\nonly jump all the cues, but actually\nget a look and feel of the Wii U and\nits weird controller. I only managed to\nplay a relatively short time, as well as\nonly two games, but that was enough\nto get a good impression of what was\ngoing on.\nSo here\u2019s a quick overview of what\nthe Wii U entails. The controller is\nquite a complex piece of equipment\nand is a step removed from the remotes and nunchuks of the Wii. It\u2019s a\nscreen surrounded by various buttons,\nkinda like the bottom half of a DS, but\nlarger. What Nintendo is trying to do\nis integrate a tablet into your gaming\nexperience, so that the second screen\nenhances your playing capabilities, i.e.\nby being the platform for mini-games.\nAlso if your brother, sister, girlfriend,\nboyfriend etc. want to interrupt your\ngame time by using the TV screen for\nanother purpose, the Wii U controller\u2019s screen can serve as your game\nscreen. While, in theory, this concept\nsounds relatively simple, in real life it\u2019s\na bit more di\ufb03cult to understand.\nBack to my\nexperience of the\nWii U. So, I stumbled into the Nintendo\narea, and was surrounded\nby various stations portraying a multitude of games. At this point, I was\novercome with choice so I just picked\nthe \ufb01rst station which was free. The\ngame I had chosen was Skylanders.\nSkylanders was released quite re-cently, and has beaten all expectations\nto become one of the most popular\ngames for young teens in 2012. It incorporates the use of actual physical\ntoys, which are placed into the game\nusing a portal and then are playable\nin-game. The Nintendo employee who\nhad been playing the game solo at that\npoint, invited me to play with him,\nplacing a \ufb01gure onto the portal. Sadly\nI can\u2019t remember at all what this \ufb01gure looked like, as, at that moment, I\nwas still in a daze due to the copious\namounts of people and games, and\nas such, unaware of all the little de-tails. Then the controller was pushed\ninto my hand and I commenced play-ing. The controller itself was a tad bit\nheavy, and unwieldy but it wasn\u2019t as\nbad as I thought it would be. However when I started playing, the actual\ncomplexity of the controller struck\nme. I had no clue what to do. That was\nthe \ufb01rst time ever that I had picked up\na game, and had no clue how to play.\nNot even the Nintendo guy seemed to\nknow what was going on. The game\nseemed to be a rail shooter, which are\nnotoriously simple to use, and yet neither me nor the actual employee had\nan inkling of how to play. The graphics of the game seemed quite nice, but\nI could not really enjoy the game as I\nwas trying to \ufb01gure out how to actually play. Perhaps a tutorial would have\nhelped, but the fact that you need to\nhave a tutorial for the console, which\nis supposed to speak to the casual\ngamer, it worries me how many actual casual gamers will pick this up.\nAlso the game itself didn\u2019t actually\nseem to use the touch screen that the\ncontroller had to o\ufb00er, or maybe I\njust hadn\u2019t \ufb01gured it out. After dying\nabout 6 times, I decided I would go to\nthe game I had actually wanted\nto see, and allow some other\nperson to \ufb01gure out how to\nactually play. The game\nI am talking about is\nZombiU.\nZombiU has been\nin the works as long\nas the Wii U has,\nand it\u2019s Nintendo\u2019s\nattempt to reach\nthe hardcore audience of gam-ers. Ever since I\nsaw some trail-e r s and explanatory\nvideos of it on YouTube, I had\nbeen excited to have a go at it. I was\nquite sure that since Nintendo was\nmaking this game just for the Wii U,\nthat the full promise of its controller\nwould be on full display. I am quite\nthe zombie fan, having played DayZ,\nResident Evil and many other games\nconcerning this subject. Thus when\nI \ufb01nally got to play, after seeing the\nprevious player brutally mauled, I was\nraring to go! The guy in charge of this\nstation actually seemed to know what\nto do, and explained the mechanics of\nthe game quite well. So when I picked\nup the controller I felt ready to kick\nsome rotting zombie\u2019s butt. Quite ee-rily, the game started with me waking\nup in a kindergarten (wonder how I\ngot there...). I had a bloody cricket bat\nand a handgun with a few bullets to\nspare. The setting and the feel of the\ngame reminded me a lot of DayZ, and\nto be honest I actually was quite tense\nduring the game. My objective was to\n\ufb01nd a way out of the kindergarten and\nsurvive. The screen of the controller\nhad a kind of map on it, which slightly\nconfused me, as I wasn\u2019t sure at which\nscreen I should be looking, in the end\ndeciding to glance down at the map\nevery so often. This did irritate me\nsomewhat, as I prefer all my game info\nto be within one concentrated area.\nSo I made my way through the kindergarten with the occasional bloody\nhandprint on the walls. When the\n\ufb01rst zombie lunged out from behind a\ncorner, not only I jumped, but the little audience that had formed around\nme did as well. I did manage to kill\nthe annoying bugger by smashing his\nhead in (very graphic and bloody), but\nI must say that the tablet-controller\ndid not seem anything special at that\npoint, and I would have perhaps preferred something smaller in my hand.\nAlso the looting of items was very\nconfusing, because you had to look\ndown onto the screen of the tablet,\nand swipe from the loot to your bag,\nconfusing and, I thought, unnecessarily complicated. Even though ZombiU\nwas turning out to be a great game,\nthe messiness and di\ufb03culty of using\nthe controller was starting to grate\nat my nerves. Then came a locked\ndoor. Apparently my character was\nan expert lock-picker, and thus a little\nmini-game came about where I had\nto pick the lock of the door using the\ncontroller. The mini-game was quite\nsimple, however I did take a peak at\nthe big screen, and was pleasantly\nsurprised to see my character in 3rd\nperson perspective actually trying to\npick the lock. This is a very nice touch\nI think, because once you have zombies coming up to you and you see\nthem out of the corner of your eye,\nthe tension mounts and opening that\ndoor may not be that easy. Although\nthis involves you dividing your attention between two di\ufb00erent screens, it\njust makes the game experience much\nmore realistic. In real life you would\nbe freaking out! When I did \ufb01nally\ndie (killed by an annoying, special,\ndisappearing zombie) accompanied\nby groans by the multitude of people\nnow ogling my game, I was sad and relieved at the same time. Sad, because\nmy character, who I had grown to like\nin my 15 minutes of playing, was dead,\nand relieved because the game was so\ngoddam scary that I was glad it was\nover.\nThe Wii U has a LOT of potential.\nZombiU is a class game that really did\nmanage to make me \ufb02inch (and every-onearoundme)atsomepoints.Itsreal-ism\nis great\n(as much as you\ncan be realistic in a zombie game), and I enjoyed mutilating\nany zombie I came across. ZombiU\nwas perfectly optimised for the Wii U,\nusing all the features that the unique\ncontroller had to o\ufb00er. Skylanders, on\nthe other hand, and probably the majority of games, are created by game\nstudios that do not understand all you\ncan do with the Wii U. This is one of\nthe biggest problems that Nintendo\nfaces, for if they do not get the right\nsupport from the game makers i.e.\ngames made with the Wii U in mind,\nnobody will buy this console, which\nwould be a big shame.\nAnother big stumbling block that\nfaces the Wii U is the complicated nature of the tablet-controller. The casual\ngamer,\nt h e\noriginal\naudience\nof the Wii,\nw i l l face great dif\ufb01culties to really get the most out of\ntheir games without using the tutorial\nor manual. Even me, a relatively experienced gamer had a few problems,\nwhich sometimes caused frustration\nmore than enjoyment. All in all, I really hope that the Wii U persists and\nactually achieves success. Nintendo\nis trying to push a whole new way of\nplaying games, which I think could be\nthe next big thing. I thoroughly enjoyed ZombiU, however with a price\nof \u00a3350 for game and console, I am\na bit worried that not enough people\nwill buy it, since for that amount of\nmoney, I know I wouldn\u2019t.\nT\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n42\nZombiU - turning this:\ninto this....\n\n"

In fact, they\u2019re a rather welcome indication\nthat holidays and the festive season are nigh, despite the fact\nmost of us will have a bit to slog through in the last week before\nlessons are over. Which can only mean one thing \u2013 yummy Christmas dinners\nahead!\nHere we\u2019ve provided a bumper guide to planning your own Christmas dinner \u2013\nthis is chie\ufb02y aimed at those who might not have made a full Christmas meal but\nwould like to try their hand at it (international freshers who will be stuck in halls\nthis holiday, I\u2019m looking at you!). That said, however, we do hope that this guide\nwill have some new tips and ideas for old hands to consider trying. All in all we\nat Food believe that preparing a hearty, impressive Christmas meal needn\u2019t be\novertly taxing or pricey \u2013 you just need a tiny bit of forethought and prep. So go\non \u2013 \ufb01re up your ovens, pour yourself a glass of mead, and cook away!\nN\nFOOD\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n26\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTradition dictates that the usual meat for\nChristmas roasts is a nice plump turkey,\ncomplete with all the trimmings. Tradition can also be damned, though; it\ndoesn\u2019tHAVEtobethatway\u2013we\u2019rerisking the wrath of some purists by making\nthis statement! The options you have at\nyour disposal for roast meats are actually aplenty; if you include \ufb02avour combinations e.g. lemon and thyme vs citrus\nspice,youcouldcookoneroastmeatdish\nevery night and have a meat marathon\nlonger than the 1001 Arabian Nights.\nBeef, chicken, lamb, pork \u2013 they\u2019re all\nequally valid choices for roasts. Besides,\nsome of us with smaller ovens and less\ntime can\u2019t con\ufb01dently \ufb01t a plump turkey\ninto them as opposed to a chicken.\nVegetarian or (heavens!) vegan? No\nMain Attraction\nYou don\u2019t necessarily *need* to have a\nstarter in your menu \u2013 but if you do,\nplease. PLEASE K.I.S.S. (keep it sim-ple, sexy) so you\u2019re not doing more\nwork than you have to in the kitchen.\nAfter all, you\u2019ll be spending quite a bit\nof time in there prepping your other\ncourses anyway! You should also keep\nit light enough (but still scrumptious)\nso that your guests won\u2019t be too stu\ufb00ed.\nThe point of a starter is just to get your\nguests\u2019 appetites (for the main) going\nanyway, not to feed them for the whole\n12 days of Christmas.\nWhat to serve, though? Popular and\nnot-too-taxing options include a small\nhelping of soup (feel free to look back\nat Issue 1531 for our guide to soups)\n\u2013 plus points to you if it\u2019s made with\npumpkin; keeps the festive theme go-ing! Canap\u00e9s are just as acceptable\nThe Start-Up\nand classy \u2013 think cocktail sausages,\nsalmon and cream cheese blinis, (mini)\nbruschetta, prawn cocktail shots or\nvegetable crudit\u00e9s (just a fancy way\nof saying raw veggie sticks like carrot\nand celery) with dipping sauces. In all\nessence they\u2019re not tricky to make, ei-ther; having it presented in such a...\nerm, \u201cfun-size\u201d manner just takes it to\na whole new level.\nIf you really want to cheat and go\nthe store-bought route for sauces and\nsome of the cooked canap\u00e9s, that\u2019s \ufb01ne\nby us. Some supermarket options have\nbeen pretty fabby in terms of quality\nover the past few years \u2013 justbe sure to\ncheck the ingredients label for any nas-ties that you\u2019re not particularly keen on,\nand follow instructions. We won\u2019t tell if\nyou don\u2019t \u2013 well, unless you present us\nwith a particularly limp set of crudit\u00e9s...\nCarol\u2019s Banging Tomato and Basil Bruschetta\nA simple healthy starter (we do need something to counteract the sinful other\ncourses!) that doesn\u2019t skimp on the flavour. I\u2019ve suggested plum tomatoes as their\nthicker skins make for easier peeling, plus they\u2019re less juicy and seedy (groan!) -but normal toms work just as well too. (Vegan Friendly)\n6-7 ripe plum tomatoes\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 tsp balsamic vinegar\n6-8 fresh basil leaves, chopped (don\u2019t\nsub in dried \u2013 doesn\u2019t work the same!)\nSalt and pepper to taste\n1 baguette French bread, or similar\ncrusty Italian bread\n1/4 cup olive oil for brushing\nMakes 24 small slices\nPrep: 15 mins // Cook: 10 mins (max)\nPreheat oven to 230\u00b0C, or as high as it\nwill go. Lightly score a cross in the bottom of the tomatoes with a knife, and\nblanch for a minute in some freshly-boiled water right from the kettle/\nstove. Drain, dunk in cold water to\nstop them cooking, and remove the\nskins. Dice up finely, removing the\nseeds and juice as you go. Put in bowl\nwith minced garlic, extra virgin olive\noil and vinegar. Mix well, add chopped\nbasil plus salt and pepper to taste.\nSlice baguette on a diagonal into\nroughly 1/2 inch thick slices. Brush one\nside of each slice with olive oil, and\nlay out on a baking tray oil side down.\nToast on the top rack for 5-6 minutes\nuntil the bread starts turning golden\nbrown. Remove and arrange olve oil\nside up. Top each slice with the tomato\nmixure just before serving \u2013 or let your\nguests DIY if you\u2019re that way inclined!\nTRADITIONAL PROTIP \u2013 Purists\nwho make bruschetta tend to toast the\nbread without oiling first, then rubbing a cut garlic clove on the top and\ndrizzling with oil. Feel free to try!\nSimply Recipes\nCarol\u2019s \u201cNot Yo Momma\u2019s\u201d Lemon and Herb Crimbo Chicken\nLemon, rosemary and thyme may be an oft-rehashed flavour combination, but stuffing a boiled and pierced lemon into the\ncavity may not be something good ol\u2019 mum may have thought of. The hot steam from the lemon will permeate the bird, slightly\ncooking and flavouring its juices from within. Experiment with other herbs and seasonings!\n1largechicken(>2kg-noteitsweight!)\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n1 large lemon, preferably unwaxed\n1 whole garlic bulb, broken into cloves\nHandful of fresh thyme\nOlive oil/butter\nHandful of fresh rosemary sprigs,\nEXTRA: 8 rashers streaky bacon\nServes 4\nPrep: 30 mins max // Cook: See chicken\nRub chicken all over and inside cavity\nwith a decent amount of salt and black\npepper (freshly ground please, no\nsneeze dust!) If possible do this ahead\nof time and leave in the fridge \u2013 maybe\nin the morning \u2013 so the seasoning has\ntime to seep in prior to roasting.\nPreheat oven to 190\u00b0C. Boil up your\nlemon and garlic \u2013 either do this when\nyou\u2019re boiling water up to blanch tomatoes for bruschetta (recipe below\nleft), or together with your potatoes if\nyou tend to parboil them before roast-ing/mashing. Once this is nice and hot,\nremove lemon and garlic \u2013 they\u2019ll be\nslightly soft.\nTake the chicken out of the fridge\nand pat down with kitchen paper. Rub\nBudgens\nneed to despair \u2013 Yiango, one of our\nown Editors, is vegan herself; and there\u2019s\nnothing wrong to preferring your farmyard animals celebrating Christmas together around the table (as opposed to\nbeingservedup).Youoryourveganmate\ndon\u2019t have to resort to purely picking at\nthe sides, or the oft-served option of your\nmother\u2019s nut roast \u2013 good news for those\nwith nut allergies!\nThink lentil and mushroom shepherd\u2019s\npie, baked risottos, or hearty vegetable\npot pies. If you\u2019re preparing a separate\noption for a vegan mate, it\u2019s not that\nmuch extra work and the meal can stay\njust as social as long as you keep your\nsides vegan friendly (sub butter for olive\nspread, etc) \u2013 all you\u2019re just preparing is a\nseparatemain,asopposedtoafull-blown\nvegan meal.\nAs for omnivores, once you\u2019ve picked\nyour meat and seasoning of choice, it\u2019s\njust a matter of doing the prep along\nwith working out how long to pop it in\nthe oven for. We\u2019ve prepared a handy-dandy time/temperature guide down\nthere, though some people do like to\nkick-start the roast at a higher temperature for about 30 minutes so they get a\ncrispy crust/skin on their meat. Whatever you do, though; make sure after you\u2019ve\ncooked your meat that you let it rest for\nat least half an hour prior to carving \u2013\nthis gives it a chance to reabsorb its juices\nso it stays moist. Neglect that rule and\nyou may just \ufb01nd Sophia or Carol charging at you with the turkey baster or a hot\npair of tongs.\nall over with olive oil, or softened butter\nif you\u2019re feeling cheeky. Stab hot lemon\ncarefully with a knife about 10 times \u2013\nthis will steam and sizzle. Put this in the\ncavity with the garlic cloves and thyme,\nthen pop on your prepared roasting tray.\nWork out how long your total cooking\ntime will be based on the weight of your\nbird (see below), making sure to baste a\nfew times during roasting.\nIf you\u2019re using bacon, roast until 45\nminutes of your total roasting time re-mains. Take out chicken pour off some\nexcess fat (save for gravy or to roast\npotatoes with), lay the bacon rashers\nover the breast and sprinkle rosemary.\nRoast until time is up and chicken is\ncooked. Otherwise, roast for full duration of the cooking time, draining excess fat halfway through if you need it.\nRemove from oven, letting meat rest\n15-30 minutes. Crumble bacon up if\nyou used it, and remove garlic and lemon from cavity. Mash up garlic, spreading it all over the chicken. Carve at the\ntable, and dig in!\nRoasting times and temperatures\nCommon sense dictates that the heavier/bigger your joint (or bird), the longer you\u2019ll have to cook it for. Below you\u2019ll find a\nguide to how hot your oven needs to be depending on your choice of meat, and how long it needs to be in there for. Remember\nthat ovens can vary, though; what the dial says may not be the true temperature \u2013 so do conduct visual testing too!\nBEEF: 180C, 25 mins per 450g + extra\n25mins for medium rare. Common\nroasting cuts these times apply to include rib, sirloin, and eye of the rump.\nPORK: 180C, 35 mins per 450g-500g\n+ extra 35 minutes. Generally pork\nshould be fully cooked, but if you want\nit medium, drop the times here to 30\nmins per 450-500g + extra 30 minutes.\nOr just get a food probe and check\nthat the internal temperature of the joint\nis 75-80C (as opposed to 80-85 for well\ndone pork.) To get crackling, score skin\nuntil the fat and rub in salt an hour prior\nto roasting. Roast initially at high heat\n(as high as your oven will allow) for 25\nminutes, then follow times for pork done\nmedium.\nLAMB: Depends if you\u2019re rushed (quick\nroasting) or have time (slow roasting).\nQuick roasting is done at 200C, 20-30mins per 450g + extra 20 mins. Slow\nroasting is done at 180C, 35 mins per\n450g + extra 35 mins.\nCHICKEN: 180C, 20 mins per 450g +\nextra 10-20 minutes. If you stuffed the\ncavity, expect to wait longer \u2013 NEVER\nOVERSTUFF. Juices run clear and thigh\nmeat pulls away easily from the bone\nwhen cooked.\n\n"

However, you have\nsuch severe morning sickness that you throw it up pre-maturely. Giving birth out of\nyour mouth knocks all your\nteeth out, so you are stuck\nwith dentures for the rest of\nyour life. Congratulations!\nThis week you run into your\ncrush underneath some mis-tletoe. This is the opportunity\nyou\u2019ve been waiting for! You\ngo for it and enjoy a passionate embrace, and god it\nfeels good! You tenderly step\nback to check this is real, but\nit\u2019s actually your supervisor\nstanding disgusted in front\nof you.\nThis week you have a delicious Christmas dinner with\nyour housemates, and even\nmanage not to burn anything.\nHowever, you eat so much\nthat you fall into a food coma.\nWhen you wake up 3 days\nlater, you have grown sprouts\nfrom your ears and can\nonly communicate through\nstrange clucking noises.\nThis week you receive an\nearly Christmas present from\nyour significant other half. You\nopen it, trembling in anticipa-tion. The gift is some expensive underwear, but it\u2019s five\nsizes too big\u2026 They mumble something about it being\nmeant for \u2018the other one\u2019; I\nthink there\u2019s something they\nmight not be telling you\u2026\nThis week you buy a festive\nthemed wank sock, also\nknown as a stocking. You\ndiligently add \u2018presents\u2019 to\nit daily until Christmas day\nand give it to your chosen\nrecipient. They ask for a\nclue as to what could be in-side; you respond that it\u2019s a\nlucky dip...

As\nyour insides slowly dissolve\nand you burn from inside out,\nyou reflect that at least it is\nthe faster and warmer way to\ndie. In hindsight though, you\nprobably should have just\nturned the heating on.\nThis week you have 100\ncoursework deadlines tomorrow and have only completed\none of them so far.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n45\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nLetters\nSir,\nI was deeply moved by Philippa Skett\u2019s\narticle the other week. Having occasionally perused the Feminist Society\nFacebook page, I cannot help but be impressed by the quality of the writing\nand the depth of the critical analysis.\nHowever, I worry that some great scienti\ufb01c brains are not so much honing their\ncritical thinking on the subject of feminism as becoming completely immersed\nby it. I for one have now been drawn in,\nand have wasted an entire evening having opinions! This is not a bad thing in\nand of itself, but I feel that feminism is\nnow becoming too dominant in Imperial\u2019s society. Becky Lane\u2019s admirable\ne\ufb00orts to get people talking about sexist\ndiscrimination are just one example of\nthis. We are all intelligent people who\nwish to share our opinions. But chasing\nafter every misunderstanding and misconception means that again and again\nwe must reiterate these arguments. Perhaps we should all vote on a feminism\npolicy and then leave it and get back to\nthe library. And if the (male-dominat-ed) vote concludes that sexism is a good\nthing, then at least we\u2019ll know for sure\nthat we have a problem!\nAnonymous, via email\n---Sir,\nWith all these articles on the topic of sexism being published recently, I can\u2019t help\nbut think that it\u2019s the Feminist society that\nis causing most of the problem. For start-ers, why is it even called the Feminist Society? Even though they claim that the term\nis gender-neutral, surely they must realise\nthat the vast majority of people do not perceive it to be so? Why not, for the avoidance of doubt, call it the Gender Equality\nSociety?\nLast year\u2019s Felix Sexism Survey\nshowed that 10.14% of the sample of\n631 students answered \u2018yes\u2019 to the question \u2018Is Imperial Sexist?\u2019. To put that in\nperspective, that\u2019s a smaller percentage\nof people than those who would currently vote for the Liberal Democrats,\naccording to a recent YouGov poll.\nTo me, it feels like this so-called\n\u201cFeminist Society\u201d are using the premise of gender equality to front a moral\ncrusade against the rest of us, presumably because they bear some kind of\nperfunctory, puerile grudge against\nsociety.\nMaybe if their members wasted less time\non Facebook and Twitter searching for examples of sex discrimination and taking\nturns to see who can denounce it using the\ngreatest number of nebulous bien-pensant\nneologisms like \u201ccis-privelege\u201d (so that any\ncasual reader must resort to Wikipedia before they can fully fathom the profundity of\nthe critique), they may fare better in their\ndegree studies, personal relationships, and\nlife in general.\nThanks to FemSoc, Imperial now has a\nreputation for sexism which, according to\na Felix survey, it does not deserve. They\nhave become the crux of the problem\nwhich they sought to resolve. It\u2019s time for\nthem to stop.\nAnonymous, via website\n---Sir,\nUpon recently reading a London-wide\nstudent paper I realised that, when it\ncomes to student politics and activ-ism, Imperial displays the epitome of\napathy. I can\u2019t think of anyone I know\nwho has attended any of the student\nprotests of late and no one really seems\nto care about what the sabbaticals do.\nI propose a small change that should\nmake Union politics at Imperial instantly more divisive and interesting. I believe\nthat o\ufb03cers and candidates should be\n\ufb01ltered into two di\ufb00erent political parties in order to help students identify\nwith them and make the election process\nall the more embittered.\nThese parties don\u2019t necessarily have to\nfollow the traditional parliamentarian\nleft/right ideologies. There could instead\nbe the anti-sexism and pro-sexism par-ties, or even the for and against Chris\nKaye parties. I hope that this subtle\nchange in how we elect sabbaticals will\nengage Imperial students more with the\nrunning of our union.\nA cradle-to-grave Tory\nor many, life has been normal so far; most have attended school, the lucky\nprogressing onto universi-ty, the majority then grad-uating. However, I realised the next 10\nyears of my (professional) life could\ncreep up on me as quickly as the last\n16 years, during which time I was being unwittingly conveyor-belted along\nan education system and churned out\ninto real life. I felt like doing something di\ufb00erent, just for a while.\n\u2018Normal\u2019 life in the UK is considered\nto be one of privilege and opportunity.\nBut this isn\u2019t how the global picture\nlooks. How often do stop to wonder\nwhy, let alone do anything about it?\nWhile deciding my next step after\nuniversity, I chose to defer my job and\nvolunteer. In reading this I hope you\nconsider doing the same.\nOn 22 January 2013 I will begin a\n3-month volunteering placement in\nBangladesh. I will be living as the locals do, collaborating with other overseas volunteers, local communities\nand organisations to address problems\nfaced by severely impoverished communities in Bangladesh. The focus is\non groups who are otherwise excluded\nfrom social and economic growth and\nwho are less resilient to economic and\nenvironmental shocks. (See end for\nmore details.)\nStatistics surrounding poverty are\ninaccessible and emotions can easily\nbe rationalised with our busy schedules and daily commitments. But poverty should never have become an acceptable thing to live with.\nWhile I\u2019m aware many of us already\nvolunteer in this country and donate\nto charity when we can, many of us\nthink we\u2019re unable to reach those in\ndistant countries, because we lack the\ncapital and the time. However, with\nthe help of donations and government\ngrants, VSO empowers 18-25 year\nolds, such as us fresh graduate meat,\nto lend our hands and brains for good\nin some of the most impoverished\ndestinations on Earth.\nBangladesh, for example, su\ufb00ers\nfrom widespread childhood malnutri-tion, and has one of the highest rates\nof maternal mortality in the world.\nThere is also a high incidence of pre-Jonathan\nKingsley\nF\nPutting the \u2018Bang\u2019 in Bangladesh: an\nalternative way to spend Spring\nJonathan Kingsley is on a mission to help Bangladesh\u2019s rural poor\nventable diseases, due to the lack of\naccess to and information about sani-tation, hygiene, nutrition and sexual\nhealth.\nThe opportunity to address these issues \ufb01rst hand requires a bit of commitment on my own soil before I leave;\nI am required to fundraise a minimum\nof \u00a3800. This not only raises awareness for the scheme so that others are\nencouraged to get involved in \ufb01ghting\nagainst poverty, but it facilitates young\npeople like us to take part.\nSo for those looking to do something memorable before knuckling\ndown to a job for the rest of your life,\nconsider volunteering your young,\nimaginative minds to VSO. And when\nthat time comes, you\u2019ll be in my shoes\nrecruiting the attention and generosity of your peers to act against poverty.\nBut for now, you can make a di\ufb00erence from the comfort of your Library\ndesk, your lecture theatre or your bed-room. Lend your support by visiting\nthe page below to donate. Otherwise,\nkeep your nostrils dilated for the scent\nof a bake sale next week on campus\nand buy some delicious cakes. To keep\ntrack of the various fundraising events\nI\u2019ll be doing.\nTo \ufb01nd out more about VSO and to\ndonate, visit:\nwww.justgiving.com/kingsley-does-vso\nInvolving local\nwomen is a cornerstone of Bangladesh\u2019s\ndevelopment policy\n\u201c\u201d\nsee my entire body\n(and head)\ntransformed\ninto something smooth\nand bare\n\n"

A website called\nSponsorAScholar.co.uk proclaimed\nthat they have set 1,400 women between the ages of 17-24 with wealthy\nbusinessmen that funded their stud-ies.\nThe website advertises women with\nglowing testimonials from satis\ufb01ed\ncustomers and claims that most of\nthe sponsors are \u201cmen between the\nages of 28 and 50 who run their own\nsuccessful business and want to have\ndiscreet adventures with a student\nwhilst helping them fund their studies\nthrough a scholarship\u201d.\nThe website states: \u201cBecause of\nthe considerable sums of money our\nsponsors are o\ufb00ering in scholarship,\nthey tell us that they have expectations of a high level of sexual intimacy\nwith their chosen student.\u201d\nSponsorAScholar.co.uk o\ufb00ers young\nwomen \u201cup to 100% of your Tuition\nFees\u201d in return for two-hour sessions\nwith men in hotel rooms or private\n\ufb02ats up to four times per term.\nThe website takes advantage of the\n\u2018grey area\u2019 of Britain\u2019s sex laws that\nallow escort agencies to function legitimately by o\ufb00ering introductions\nbetween clients and sex workers. It\nis illegal to run a website where sex\nis o\ufb00ered for money but as a bypass\nservices can o\ufb00er models and escorts\ninstead. People can only be arrested\nfor controlling prostitution if there is\ndirect evidence that sex is being exchanged form money.\nOn the SponsorAScholar.co.uk\nwebsite the extensive terms and conditions describe an agreement which\ncovers time and companionship to-gether. It says the \u201clevel of sexual intimacy\u201d is privately agreed between\nstudent and sponsor whilst the owners of the website are not responsible\nfor what occurs between consenting\nadults in a hotel room.\nAn under-cover female reporter for\nThe Independent secretly \ufb01lmed an interview she had with a male \u2018assessor\u2019\nfrom SponsorAScholar.co.uk who told\nher that: \u201cThe more you\u2019re prepared to\ndo, the more interest you\u2019re going to\nget, obviously the more sponsorship\namount you\u2019re going to get for that.\u201d\nHe went on to say that she would\nhave to undergo a \u2018practical assessment\u2019 with him for \u2018quality control\u2019\npurposes and explained that \u201cWe have\nto do that, to make sure when we put\nyou in front of your sponsor you\u2019re\ncon\ufb01dent in doing the things you said\nyou would do.\u201d\nThe man added: \u201cYou see what\nyou\u2019re trying to do is attract a certain\nlevel of sponsorship, you don\u2019t want\nto go up there saying you know you\u2019re\nnot even going to hold hands type of\nthing\u2026 cause you\u2019re not going to attract any interest at all.\u201d\nThe male \u2018assessor\u2019 was later identi\ufb01ed as Mark Lancaster. He refused\nto speak about the Sponsor a Scholar\nscheme when asked by a television\nprogramme. The website was taken\ndown soon after the Independent published the story and secretly \ufb01lmed\nvideo. The website has been altered\nand now say: \u201cSorry website unavailable for maintenance\u201d.\nDespite the website closing, a female escort claimed that she was approached by a man claiming to be\nfrom the website and are still trying to\n\ufb01nd new \u201cscholars\u201d.\nKelley Temple, NUS Women\u2019s Of\ufb01cer, said: \u201cIt appears to be\u2026 exploiting the fact that women students are\nin dire \ufb01nancial situations in pursuit\nof an education.\u201d\nAn anonymous student told Channel 4 News that when she went to a\nrented \ufb02at with the man for an inter-view, she was made to dress up in a\nschoolgirl out\ufb01t and pressured into\nhaving sex with her \u2018assessor\u2019.\nWhen it came to the \u2018practical\u2019 part\nof the interview, the student found\nherself unable to \ufb01ght o\ufb00 his ad-vances. She said, \u201cthen he just kissed\nme before I really had time to think\nabout it or ask any questions\u2026 and I\njust froze because I really didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do. Then he started undressing me.\n\u201cI was in a di\ufb00erent city, and he\u2019d\npicked me up from outside the place\nand walked me in so in my mind I was,\nlike \u2018I can\u2019t leave right now because\nI don\u2019t know where I am and if I do\nleave and he chases me, I don\u2019t know\nwhat to do\u2019. So I just froze and went\nalong with what he was doing.\u201d\nEven after having sex with the stranger she was sent an email rejecting her\nfrom the scholarship programme but\ntold her to reapply later. She said she\nhad contacted the website as she was\nstruggling to pay her university fees.\nConcerns have been raised that\ndue to the rise in tuition fees, some\nstudents will end up graduating with\ndebts of up to \u00a353,000. It has been\nthought that due to these huge debts\nstudents are turning to ulterior forms\nof employment such as pole dancing,\nescort work or prostitution in order to\npay back these debts.\nIt has been said that university\nwelfare o\ufb03cers are largely unaware\nof these situations and are poorly\nequipped to deal with these issues and\nthe increase in young student\u2019s involvement which such activities.\nResearch by Dr Ron Roberts, of the\nUniversity of Kingston, published in\n2010 suggested that one in four students know someone who had worked\nin the sex industry to fund their studies \u2013 up from three per cent in 1990.\nDr Roberts found 16 per cent would\nconsider working in the industry\nwhile more than one in 10 were open\nto the idea of being an escort.\nDr Dan Boucher, Director of Parliamentary A\ufb00airs for the International\nChristian Charity Care, said young\npeople should not have to subject\nthemselves to exploitation in order\nto complete their studies. \u201cThe Independent\u2019s investigation has revealed\none particular and disturbing manifestation of sexual exploitation.\n\u201cWith a background of an 8 per cent\nfall in applications to university this\nyear and mounting concerns about\ndebts, it is clear that sexual predators\nhave seen an opportunity to exploit\nthe \ufb01nancial vulnerability of struggling students,\u201d he said.\nThe police are currently examining\nthe evidence collected during The Independent\u2019s investigation and will try\nto establish whether the people behind the website can be prosecuted\nfor the accused o\ufb00ences of incitement\ninto prostitution and sexual exploita-tion.\nFollowing the success of last week\u2019s\nImperial Fringe event focused on\nbone research taking place across the\nCollege, which was estimated to have\ngathered around 400 people throughout the evening with 120 people participating in the panel discussion, a\nnew event called \u2018A Feast of the Sciences\u2019 is about to take place.\nThis month\u2019s event includes a wide\nrange of disciplines such as thermo-dynamics, biotechnology, agriculture,\nmedicine and many others. Nevertheless, all of them are there to celebrate\nthe festive spirit to create a true \u2018Feast\nfor the Sciences\u2019.\nThe evening will start with the\npresentation of Miss Cakehead, a renowned confectioner who\u2019s famous\nfor a variety of her works, including\n\u2018Eat your heart out\u2019 series of anatomically decorated edible arts. This time\nthe audience will be delighted with a\nvariety of Christmas dainties made of\nsponge and sugar. This will be followed\nby a great number of other yummy\ntreats including ice cream out of a \ufb01re\nextinguisher presented by Professor in\nthermodynamics Erich Muller, honey\nfrom Imperial\u2019s own hives located in\nthe garden just behind Ethos and Alchemists Dreams o\ufb00ering to create\nand taste your own seasonal drinks.\nOn a more serious note, the speakers will touch upon the issues of food\nproduction including Imperial\u2019s own\nfertilizing machine, its sustainability\nand security as well as health related\nfood concerns such as obesity.\nEvent organiser Harriet Martin\nsaid: \u201cA food and drink-themed Imperial Fringe at Christmas is the perfect\nseasonal way of introducing people\nto some of the College\u2019s research. We\nhope that members of the Imperial\ncommunity as well as external audiences will enjoy the exciting activi-ties, as well as sampling some festive\ndelights.\u201d\nThe event is open to general public\nincluding, of course, Imperial stu-dents, and will take place on Thursday\nthe 13 December 2012 at the Main\nEntrance of the South Kensington\ncampus between 5 and 8 pm, how-ever, everyone is free to come and go\nas please.\nFeasting on sciences at Imperial Fringe\nYulia Negreskul Reporter\nAemun Reza News Editor\nAn ex-Imperial\nstudent, who\njust refused\nto leave the\nLibrary\nThe SponsorAScholar\nwebsite at the moment\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

With the added challenge of trying to decipher the mind of Joss Whedon at 6am.\nJust before finishing for the holidays, Imperial Cinema gives you one last chance to prove your All-Nighter chops. After all, that\u2019s what all those sleepless nights at the Library were for, not for your degree that\u2019s for\nsure.

Joseph\nGordon-Levitt is a \u201clooper\u201d, a hitman hired to kill those sent\nback from his future. It\u2019s best not to ask questions about the\nphysics and just enjoy this rare smart sci-fi action film.\nRotten Tomatoes \u2013 94%\nSkyfall\nAs the memories of Bruce Willis crawling through the vents\nin Die Hard come flooding back, you feel like you need another hit of action to take the edge off. Imperial Cinema\ngladly hands you what you need. Daniel Craig reprises his\nrole as Mr Bond, which sees the franchise firmly ground\nBond in the 21st century while also questioning whether\nespionage and exploding pens really fit in with the age of\ncyber terrorism.\nRotten Tomatoes - 92%\nThe Perks of Being a\nWallflower\nTime for a coffee and some food for your action come\ndown. The shakes slowly fade as you ask for a coffee, shaken\nnot stirred, and get called a twat. Time for some childhood\nreflection.

Not your standard horror fair, this\ngenre bending film twists and turns like no other and only\ntries to unravel horror movie clich\u00e9s.\nRotten Tomatoes - 91%\nAfter updating your Amazon wish list with all the Madagascar beanie babies, glad you brought your sleeping bag\nand PJs, it\u2019s time to grit your teeth for the 5th or \u201cnap time\u201d\nfilm.\nTom Hardy proves he doesn\u2019t sound like David Attenborough on steroids in this prohibition era movie. Based on the\ntrue story of the Bondurant Brothers, who get in too deep\nonce the mob and the law come down on their bootlegging\nbusiness.\nRotten Tomatoes \u2013 68%\nThe End\nIf you made it this far: congrats, you can now wear the title Trusted Idol Rector of Extended Days, or\nTIRED for short.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n41\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nTop Fifteen Films of 2012\n15) Brave\nPixar seems to strike gold with\nevery \ufb01lm they produce and their\n2012 effort is no exception to this\nrule. The tale of a young, red-head\nprincess (voiced by the feisty Kelly\nMacdonald) is a charming, sweet\ntreat full of action, comedy and heart.\n14) Looper\nAn emotionally charged, intelligent\nsci-\ufb01 full of slick action and clever\nstrands of narrative that all weave\ntogether, it uses the complex theme\nof time travel to its advantage. Joseph\nGordon-Levitt also shows he can take\ncharge as a competent leading man.\n13) Killing Them Softly\nGangster \ufb01lms don\u2019t always require\nbullets and bodies to be compelling,\nas director Andrew Dominik proves\nhere. With obvious parallels made to\nthe world economy and politics, the\ncleverly written script is also given\nproper treatment by its superb cast.\n12) Silver Linings Playbook\nA romantic-comedy with an off-beat\ntwist of mental illness, here is a bold\nbut sensitive probe into characters\nwho are far from perfect. With\noutstanding performances all-round,\nit builds up to a rousing, resounding\nfeel-good \ufb01nale.\n11) Life of Pi\nChances are, this is the most beautiful\n\ufb01lmyou\u2019llseethisyear,asAngLeehas\ncaptured the un\ufb01lmable, adapting\nthe best-selling novel of the same\nname. That the \ufb01lm doesn\u2019t have a lot\nto say doesn\u2019t matter; you\u2019ll be blown\naway regardless.\n10) Moonrise Kingdom\nWes Anderson is at his best in which\nhe explores the trials and tribulations\nof a couple of 10-year-olds who are\non a quirky romantic adventure of\na lifetime. It\u2019s a delightful journey\nlooking at innocence, hope, love and\nperhaps giving life another shot.\n9) Avengers Assemble\nWithout a doubt the biggest movie\nof 2012, it\u2019s not at all surprising that\nJoss Whedon\u2019s superhero ensemble\nsmashedallsortsofboxofficerecords.\nWell constructed, \ufb01nely detailed and\nabove all, hugely entertaining, this is\nexactly what the summer needed.\n8) Pitch Perfect\nGlee without all the cheese and\nthe repetitive \u201cbe yourself\u201d vomit-inducing, corny messages, this is\nfunnier and smarter than that show\nwil ever be. Also featuring Rebel\nWilson in a star-making turn. Best\nSupporting Actress Oscar? Why not?\n7) Chronicle\nWith darker spins, less budget, and\nmore honest perception into the\ncorrupt side to power, here is the\nsuperhero \ufb01lm to beat in the future.\nFeaturing three very different but\nrelatable characters, it\u2019s an exciting\naddition to a predictable genre.\n6) End of Watch\nHandheld \ufb01lming methods seem to\nbeoverdonethesedays,butunderthe\nright hands, it can turn even the more\ntiresome genre into one of the most\nexhilarating cinematic experiences.\nwith utmost realism, fresh banter,\nand plenty of hardcore action.\n5) Amour\nMichael Haneke is an arthouse\nfavourite, as his patient but invasive\nmethods are hard to ignore. His latest\nis by no means a cheery affair, dealing\nwith a slow death of a woman, but in\nits quiet, understated direction, there\nis plenty of beauty to be found.\n4) The Hunt\nA consistently haunting, morally\nreprehensible tale that couldn\u2019t have\ncome out at a more appropriate time.\nIt features a powerful performance\nfrom its lead, Mads Mikkelsen, as an\ninnocent kindergarten teacher falsely\naccused of paedophilia.\n3) Seven Psycopaths\nThe weirder, wackier and wilder it\ngets, the better. Martin McDonaugh\u2019s\nfollow-up to his highly acclaimed\nIn Bruges, is more hysterical, more\nbizarre, and even more watchable.\nPlus you get plenty of pure gold\nChristopher Walken moments.\n2) Argo\nBen Affleck cleverly sustains nail-biting tension juggling a hostage\nsituation, a secret CIA operation,\nHollywood involvement, politics,\nintermittent yet effective comedy, all\nput together perfectly to produce his\nbest directorial feature yet.\n1) Beasts of the Southern Wild\nYes, it\u2019s probably a \ufb01lm not many people have seen yet, but trust us when we say that this truly is the most spectacular piece\nof \ufb01lmmaking of this year, which may come as a shock, as no big names are involved, and it\u2019s a feature \ufb01lm debut for a \ufb01rsttime director. And yet what Benh Zeitlin (director) manages here is to create a whole new different world for the audience to\nbecome a part of, a world so powerful, colourful, rich and touching that you would want to immerse yourself fully into and\nexplore the unknown. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, only a \ufb01ve-year-old girl at the time of \ufb01lming, gives a performance so tender and\nbeautiful (I\u2019M THE MAN!!! I\u2019M THE MAN!!!) that she can stand alone at the \ufb01lm\u2019s centre and completely grab our attention.\nHeart-breaking at times but undeniably stirring even at an incredibly short length, you owe it to yourself to go see this movie.\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n44\nChristopher Kaye\nDemocracy and the law\nomen are safer\ndrivers. That is\na fact backed up\nby overwhelming statistical\nevidence. By being male I pay more\nfor my car insurance.\nSurely, then, I should welcome the\nfact that, as of 21st December, \u2018gender\ndiscrimination\u2019 in the insurance industry is to be banned?\nNo, I don\u2019t welcome it at all. In part\nbecause it would be very hypocritical for me to criticise the self-styled\n\u2018equality\u2019 movement when it tries to\ncensor Felix, only to then keep quiet\non the rare occasions it bene\ufb01ts me.\nBut there\u2019s a greater principle at stake\nhere: democratic legitimacy.\nOn a concept as controversial as\nthis, you would think that Parliament\nwould\u2019ve spent months debating such\na bill; ping-ponging its way between\nCommons and Lords until \ufb01nally, after many late evenings, the enacting\nscrawl \u2018Elizabeth R\u2019 turns the bill into\nan Act. But no. On this issue, none of\nthat has happened.\nYou see, this ban on \u2018discrimination\u2019\nis not something our elected MPs have\ndecided to introduce. In fact, the UK\nGovernment is \ufb01rmly against it. It\nW\nThe EU\u2019s implementation of \u201cequality\u201d legislation is undermining\nnational democracy, argues, Christopher Kaye\nwasn\u2019t even the European Parliament\n(who, in theory at least, is vaguely ac-countable) who nodded it through.\nInstead it was the European Court of\nJustice who in March 2011 decided to\namend European Directive 2004/113/\nEC because its provisions speci\ufb01cally\nallowing gender-sensitive pricing was\n\u201cincompatible with the principle of\nequal treatment in EU law\u201d. That is\ndespite the fact such a derogation was\nexplicitly included in the original Directive!\nNow, last time I checked, the ECJ\nwas not elected by anyone. Call me\nold-fashioned, but I always assumed\nthat it was a judiciary\u2019s job to uphold\nlaw; what the law actually says. Not\nwhat they think the law should say.\nBecause the UK is a member of the\nEU, we are obliged to implement EU\nDirectives whether we like them or\nnot. Our Government didn\u2019t like this\namended Directive. Among other\nthings, HM Treasury pointed out that\nfemale drivers would be e\ufb00ectively\nsubsidising male drivers, also incenti-vising the purchase of higher risk cars\nby men.\nIn addition to motoring, life insurance will also become more expensive\nas fewer women (who have longer life\nexpectancies) can a\ufb00ord to buy it, thus\nincreasing the risk-pool for the insurance company.\nDespite their sensible opposition,\nthe UK Government still ultimately\nbent over and took it. We will soon\n\ufb01nd out whether Parliament will also\nbend over and accept Votes for Prisoners too. Whatever your view on\nthese issues, you have to ask: Where\nis the scrutiny?\nPersonally I would be against such\nmeddling regardless of who introduced it. But at least if it was our\nGovernment, I could use my vote to\nshow them the error of their ways at\nthe next election. Sadly, as long as EU\nlaw is supreme over national law, with\nEuro-judges making up laws on the\nspot, there\u2019s bugger all we can do.\nOnline\nIn response to \u201cPick-up artistry & arseholery\u201d, 30th November:\nI believe this article is clear sexism against men, there is so much\nhate into it. I believe that when there is a problem it is always more\nthan one\u2019s fault. So girls that fall from this \u2018\u2019tricks\u2019\u2019 (as you suppose)\nshould actually wake up as well. Maybe guys should create a Guys\nSociety (there is a Feminist society) so that they \ufb01ght against sexist\narticles like these one. (Feminist Society=Sexism Source). My point:\nThe answer to sexism is not sexism!\n- Anonymous\nAnonymous, I\u2019m sorry, but no: it\u2019s really not, and I agree with you\nentirely that sexism shouldn\u2019t be fought with further sexism. Despite what you may think, feminism \ufb01ghts against sexism towards\nmen too, and we don\u2019t condone articles like this. That said, I don\u2019t\nthink this is anywhere near as problematic as PUAs themselves\nwho literally believe in manipulating women into sex.\n- Keir Little\nI got stalked by a fat girl back at school and she didn\u2019t leave me\nalone till I stomped on a Frube and it went all over her. If you can\u2019t\nunderstand that the guy at the union wearing a stupid hat who\nclaims to be in IBD at Goldman and a adult \ufb01lm star is lying you\ndeserve what\u2019s coming your way. Seriously who cares?. With all the\narticles about female right recently in Felix I think it\u2019d be better\nmanaged by Rupert Murdoch.\n- Annoyed Penguin\nThis article is awesome. Some nerdy loser tried this on me in the\nunion once. He was so con\ufb01dent, until he asked to read my palm\nand I realised what was going on. The second I said \u201cOMG you\nare NOT just trying the game on me?!\u201d His face dropped and his\nentire con\ufb01dence-act vanished completely. I\u2019m not even angry at\nthe guys whose self-esteem is so low that they feel their only way of\ngetting women to sleep with them is by insulting them and lying. I\njust have one piece of advice for guys who think tehre is any value\nin this: The ultimate path to being alone forever is building all\nyour social interaction \u201cskills\u201d with women on lies an manipula-tions, so I suggest you think about what\u2019s more important to you\nin the long run.\nI also personally think that this kind of behaviour completely\nobjectifies women, and that is an insult to every single girl, especially within Imperial. We all have brains, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here...\n- Anonymous II\nAnnoyed Penguin, well, you\u2019re clearly a charmer. Here\u2019s why it mat-ters: Imperial has a terrible reputation for sexism. This is so well\nknown now that it\u2019s now known by other universities around London. This is not to say that other universities don\u2019t have their own\nproblems with sexism (they do), but at IC it is blatant. It prevents\nwomen from doing what they want or need. It\u2019s embarrassing and\nlimits the university\u2019s outlook. You are also a\ufb00ected by it and it\nsways opinions about whether people should go there for undergraduate and postgraduate study.\n- Old Boy IC Graduate\nImperial only has a terrible reputation for sexism because no-one\nwill shut the fuck up about it. I seriously can\u2019t be the only one who\nopens comment, sees the sexism article of the week (because there\nis -always- one) and goes \u201cOh for FUCK\u2019S sake...\n\u201d\n- Park Jae-sang\n---In response to \u201cClubs with Wordpress sites need to upgrade or\nbe hacked... intense\u201d, 30th November:\nIt\u2019s too easy to hide behind the whole \u2018OMG USE SSL\u2019 thing, just\nbecause one of the Ss stands for \u201csecure\u201d. Most browsers won\u2019t\nwarn about iframes or cross-domain AJAX requests, particularly if the user has ticked the \u201cdon\u2019t warn me again\u201d box. It\u2019s\nno substitute for writing secure code, and I would have thought\nthat Wordpress, as an open source community-reviewed pro-ject, would be far more resilient to attack than some contributed\ncode by Imperial students. I have seen code written by the current Union President and ex-Sysadmin that has made me feel\nphysically sick. I say you force everyone to use PDO prepared\nstatements.\n- Careful\nI\u2019m not using SSL as some form of silver bullet that will magically\nsolve all these issues, it\u2019s part of a number of things I am doing.\nDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019m not going to sit in my chair and relax now! An\nadded bene\ufb01t of mandating SSL will hopefully be realised once\nI get the necessary approval from the powers that be, but you\u2019ll\nhopefully \ufb01nd out about that one soon.\n- Philip Kent\n---In response to \u201cSexism and science\u201d, 23rd November:\nWarning: word \u201csexism\u201d detected! Brace for impact of 9000-mega-ton rage bomb\n- Anonymous\nevi\nfor\nS\nfact\ndisc\nWell, she\u2019s not\ngetting insurance\ndriving like that\n\n"

Set against the\nbackdrop of WW2, this charming\nfamily oriented film always gets\nme in the mood for the holidays.\n3\nBridget Jones & Bridget\nJones: The Edge of Reason: Christmas just isn't\nChristmaswithoutdearold\nBridget. Renee Zellweger plays the\nhapless chain-smoking diarist per-fectly; becoming the instant poster\nchild for singletons everywhere.\nHugh Grant, Colin Firth and\nSpanx make this a holiday must.\n5\nHook: This reworking of the classic Peter\nPan story is great family\nviewing, Robin Williams\nplays the grown up Pan bril-liantly, and Dustin Hoffman is\nhilarious as the title villain. The\nthemes of family and the importance of being young at heart are\nexplored,andtheendingislovely.\n6\nSanta Claus: I was trying to keep overtly\nChristmassy films for\nlater in December, but\ntoday is St Nicholas', a day for\nthe Germans and Dutch to get\ninto the festive spirit. Regardless of your nationality, enjoy\nthis straightforward film full\nof reindeer, mischievous elves\nand plenty of Christmas cheer.\n7\nMoulin Rouge: Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece is one\nof my favourite films ever,\nand whilst not festive (ex-cept for its colour palette), has\nsome amazing medleys and reworkings of classic songs. The direction is great: stylish, fantastical\nand theatrical \u2013 and Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor shine in\nthe leading roles.\n8\nFantasia: for those who\nhave been paying at-tention, I hate this film,\nbut the decision about\nwhether or not to include it was\nvetoed by my co-Editors. These\nearly Disney animations set to\nvarious works of classical music are widely thought to be\ncharming and kitschy, and are\na favourite for this time of year.\n9\nEdward Scissorhands:\nSet at Christmas-time,\nJohnny Depp plays an\nartificIal man with\nscissors for hands. Uncommonly gentle, he has pity taken\non him by a family, and falls in\nlove with their eldest daughter\nKim (Winona Ryder). Tragedy\nensues, but the film remains\nheartwarming and magical.\n10\nThe Holiday:\nStuffed fuller\nthan a turkey\nwith national ste-reotypes, this rom-com set over\nChristmas and New Year is essential viewing. When Winslet\nand Diaz get bored of their LA\n/Cotswolds lives respectively,\nthey house-swap for the holiday\nseason. Funny and feel-good.\n11\nPolar Express: the\nhugely successful\ncomputer animation tells the story\nof a young boy aboard a powerful\nmagical train on a journey to the\nNorth Pole to see Santa. This is a\nfilmaboutselfdiscoveryandfaith.\nThis is a visually stunning film,\nwith voiceovers by Tom Hanks.\n12\nElf: Will Ferell stars\nas Buddy, a human\nbrought up with the\nElves at the North\nPole travels to New York to meet\nhis heartless birth father Walter.\nThis is a goofy comedy with some\ntouching themes. It is inevitably\nclich\u00e9d, but that's probably what\nyou want in a light holiday film.\n13\nLady and the\nTramp: the list\nwas looking a little Disney light,\nand this is about as Christmassy as Disney gets without being terrible. Adorable Lady falls\nin love with stray dog Tramp\nover a plate of spaghetti and\nmeatballs. Ridiculously cute.\n14\nThe Muppets Christmas Carol: the retelling of the classic\nDickens tale, with the\nbeloved Muppets cast. I was actually\nquitescaredofthisasachild.Scrooge,\nthe ultimate grumpy old man, is taken on a trip in time by the ghosts of\nChristmas Past, Present and Future\nin a bid to change his mean ways.\n15\nMiracle on 34th\nStreet: An old\nman claiming to\nbe Santa is institu-tionalised as insane, but a young\nlawyer decides to prove in court\nthat he is the real deal. This is a\nwarmhearted classic about the\nreal meaning of Christmas, and\na step away from commercialism.\n2\nHarry Potter and the\nPhilosopher's Stone:\nThe first in the fran-chise, revisit a time\nwhen the wizarding trio were\nyoung and cute.

I\u2019d get rid of the secret track, but that\u2019s because secret tracks are stupid\nand should all be permanently removed from existence. An Awesome Wave is not\nmindblowing. It won\u2019t change your life. It\u2019s just the best new album I\u2019ve listened to\nthisyear,andisn\u2019tthatjustalittlesad.\nStuart Masson\nPurity Ring: Shrines\nThis decade brought internet \u201cmicrogenres\u201d of songs shared by friends on tumblr, covered\nin gaudy aesthetics as important as the sound itself, never meant for public consumption.\nSome were picked up by critics, given names that the artists rejected, gained some legitimacy.\nWitch-house, with its cult imagery and haunted, pitch-shifted vocals was the most prominent\nof these, coming into the public eye over 2011.\nDoomed to fail almost as soon as it arose, most artists had unsearchable names made of\ncross, dagger and triangle symbols, releasing a single EP then disappearing into obscurity. The\nbuzz died, an aborted aesthetic experiment which became a ghost like the sheets of so many\nwitch-house album covers.\nOf the few notable acts to rise from the scene, it\u2019s perhaps telling that the one furthest removed from the genre, Purity Ring, became the most successful. Releasing a few choice singles over the course of a year, they\nshowcased witch-house production without the pretension: a typical male/female synth-pop duo in the vein of The Knife or\nCrystal Castles, but with throbbing bass synth swells, muted 808 kicks and eerie distorted backing vocals.\nThey brought this into a coherent work with their release of their debut, Shrines, in July: a continuation of their already-trademark sound, with the tracks all just variant enough, and the album just short enough, to keep things from getting boring.\nThe lyrics play on the sound - a jarring mix of romance and sheer body horror, from \u201ccut open my sternum and pull / my little\nribsaroundyou\u201dor\u201cdrilllittleholesintomyeyelids/thatImightseeyouwhenIsleep\u201dalltrilledinapoppy,almostcutseyvoice.\nIt\u2019s here that the witch-house image is most apparent, but the lead vocals cut above the mix with surprising clarity - Shrines is\npop, of a sort, and signals the end of a dying subgenre while rising from its ashes.\nKeir Little\nPortico Quartet: PorticoQuartet\nWhenmanygenresarethrownagainstoneanother,gettingtherightbalancesuchthatthebeast\nwill actually get off the ground is difficult enough, but to create an entirely new space, where\neachconstituentideaisrepresentedinjusttherightamount,vergesonaccidental\u2013ormagical.\nPortico Quartet manage exactly this with a humble palette of instruments. On their debut\nalbum released in 2007, they played straight forward, cheerful jazz as a four piece (saxophone,\ndouble bass, drums and hang). Two albums later, their self-titled album released this January\nhas its sound completely changed by adding synthesisers, electronic percussion, violin, and an\nassortment of loops and drones. The basic ideas of jazz are re-appropriated for creating dark\ninstrumentals with progressive structures, experimental soundscapes starring Art Blakey style\ndrumsolos,andsparseambientinterludesconstructingsoftdelicatemoods.\nThefirstsingle,\u2018Ruins\u2019,opensontoadoublebassleadandsimpleelectronicgroove.Whatsetsthetoneisthehang,providing\nan ominous, bassy swell as the beat becomes more complex. The energy of the band rides up and down led by emotive saxophone lines, which, whilst jazzy in style, feel accurate and meaningful.

The overall result is an album that should entertain those up for a smooth,\nintelligentride,ortojusttakethemsomewheretheyfeelthey\u2019veneverreallybeenbefore.\nRobin Thomas\nGrimes: Visions\nWhen talking about Claire Boucher, a.k.a. Grimes, it is difficult to make her not seem like some\nkind of hipster parody created by VICE magazine; a 24 year-old Canadian native who sports a\nvariety of hair colours, released her first album Geidi Primes on cassette tape, and went without\nfoodorsleepforthreeweekswhilecreatingherlatestalbumVisions\u2013abeguilingmixofdreamy\nsynth-popmixedwithinfectiousbeatsandanincrediblyhighvocalrange.Sofar,sokooky.\nHowever, if you look past the ever so slightly hipper-than-thou image Grimes projects, you\u2019ll\nfindthatVisionsisanabsolutelyincrediblealbum,andcompletelydeservesthetopspotthisyear.\nUsingahugerangeofsamplesalongsidelayeredandloopingvocals,Grimescreatessongswhich\nmanage to be both complex, and somehow also sparse. Standout tracks include \u2018Genesis\u2019, an incrediblycatchytuneinwhichairyvocalsfloataboveabouncybackingtrack,and\u2018Skin\u2019,inwhich\nBoucher\u2019s shrill, somewhat unnerving voice delivers intimate, confessional lyrics such as \u201cYou\ntouch me once again and somehow it stings/because I know it is the end\u201d. Beautiful stuff. The video for \u2018Oblivion\u2019, another quality\ntrack which conjures up a hazy, dream-like atmosphere, manages to perfectly encapsulate the essence of Visions; Grimes sings in\nthe audience of a packed stadium, moshes with a group of frat boys, and dances outside with skater kids. The pastel-hued video is\nwonderfullyeccentric,andGrimescomesacrossasacompletelyjoyfuloddball\u2013watchitandseeforyourself.\nOne of the many unique facets of Grimes\u2019 personality is how much control she has over her artistic vision. In a recent interview\nwith Dazed and Confused she described herself not as a musician, but as a \u201ccurator of stuff\u201d, something which comes across in her\nwork;aswellasprovidingvocalsforthetracks,sheproducedtheentirealbum,directedthemusicvideos,anddesignedallthecover\nart.ThelastyearhasbeenunbelievableforGrimes,whoseascentfromobscuritytohipsterstardomdoesn\u2019tseemtoshowanysigns\nofslowingdown;Ilookforwardtowhatshedoesnextwithbatedbreath,andsoshouldyou.\nFred Fyles\nKiller Mike: R.A.PMusic\n\u201cHardcore G shit, homie, I don\u2019t play\naround\u201d are the words that mark the beginning of R.A.P. Music and there isn\u2019t a\nmoment in the next 45 minutes that don\u2019t\nlive up to this intensity. The greatest\nstrength of this album is this energy that\nruns through it. The record was created\nalmost entirely by Mike and producer ElP, with only a few guest appearances, and\nthis is exactly how it feels. It oozes this\npassion of two guys making music they\nlove for people who love music, a huge\nlove letter to the last three decades of hip hop, while simultaneously providing\nthe genre with another great, forward looking album. Music that celebrates\nthe past like this would usually run dangerously close to being cheesy but it\u2019s\nhow genuine Mike is that makes this work. \u201cI\u2019ve never really had a religious\nexperience, in a religious place / Closest I\u2019ve ever come to seeing or feeling God\nis listening to rap music\u201d claims Mike on the title track. And when records are\nbeing made like this, it\u2019s not hard to see why.

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n35\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nOui Love\nAs part of the UK tour, the promotional platform for popular French music\nstopped o\ufb00 in a tiny room of a Dalston\npub for their London date.\nFirst up was Yan Wagner, a handsome young Frenchie with a recently\nreleased debut album; slightly reminiscent of acts such as Jimmy Edgar. Being solo, it was di\ufb03cult to be animated\nwhile trying to press buttons, sing,\nand charm the crowd which probably\naccounted for some of the awkward\nand unsure dancing. Being the \ufb01rst\nup is never so easy. However, it probably can\u2019t be refuted that his whispers\nof \u201clooovesick\u2026all week\u201d produced a\ntingly warm feeling deep, deep, deep\ndown which may have also accounted\nfor the awkward and unsure dancing.\nAlthough not an overly-impressive act,\nWagner\u2019s set was nonetheless enjoy-able.\nFollowing were groove and funk-saturated Jupiter. Their joking around\nand crowd banter managed to get\neveryone excited and up for, again,\nawkward and unsure dancing \u2013 there\nseems to be a pattern re-emerging here.\nThe highlight of the set was French\nbeauty Am\u00e9lie who pranced around\nin a pretty pink skirt and demonstrated\nhow to dance without showing signs of\nawkwardness. Her vocals, accented by\nParisian tones when crooning \u201cI need\na boogieman\u201d, were equally as charm-ing. However, there is only so much\nof French disco that one can take, and\nsadly their set had to come to an end.\nJuveniles \ufb01nished o\ufb00 the evening\nwith their electro-oriented indie-pop.\nClassi\ufb01able more along the lines of\nHousse de Racket and Is Tropical,\nthese Kitsun\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were more for\nwatching and less for dancing. Their set\nwas slightly disappointing compared to\nthe eagerness that Jupiter managed to\nrile up in the crowd, and they stuck out\na little on the line up compared to their\nmore electro-heavy predecessors of\nthe night. Unless you are 15 or able to\nmaintain love for all things indie-pop\nfor more than \ufb01ve years, Juveniles may\nnot be the band for everyone. However,\ntheir ending on most accessible track\n\u2018We Are Young\u2019 in which deep vocals\nare contrasted against synth (yes, we\u2019ve\nall heard those Joy division comparisons thank you) was the highlight of\nthe set.\nLily Le Writer\nElectro-Swing at KOKO\nNovember 21st, was an important day\nfor British fans of the electro-swing\nband Caravan Palace. They held their\n\ufb01rst ever concert in the UK \u2013 which\ntook place not too far from Imperial\nCollege, in the Camden KOKO venue.\nCaravan Palace started o\ufb00 in France\nwith three members \u2013 Vial, Payen, and\nDelaporte \u2013 who were originally hired\nto produce a soundtrack for silent porn\n\ufb01lms. They formed a group and a year\nlater met a music producer who booked\nthem for a series of gigs. At this point,\nthey decided that they needed more\nband members, and found the rest with\nMySpace.\nCaravan Palace de\ufb01ne themselves as\nan electro-swing band. The most common type of electro-swing band is a\nsmall group of two to four members;\none of which is a singer and one laptop\nmusician who deals with loops and prerecorded sounds. Caravan Palace are\ndi\ufb00erent in that most of what they play\nis live \u2013 aside from the base two mem-bers, they have an additional \ufb01ve playing\nlive instruments (violin, clarinet, guitar,\nbass, trombone and even a vibraphone),\nand feature a stronger jazz in\ufb02uence\nthan some bands \u2013 certainly as compared to Swingrowers or Bastardos\nBrothers (who played at last years summer ball).\nThey toured France for about a year\nbefore recording for their \ufb01rst album,\ncalled Caravan Palace too, which was\nreleased near the end of 2008. They\nreached #11 in the French album charts,\nand the success kept on coming. Their\nlatest album, Panic, was released in the\nUK just two days before the concert \u2013\non the 19th November 2012. Whilst\nmany people prefer the \ufb01rst album, this\nis still de\ufb01nitely worth listening to.\nUpon my arrival at the concert there\nwere few others there, although many\npeople trying to buy spare tickets outside as it had been sold out for months.\nBy the time the support band (Swing-rowers) were on stage, the place was\npacked \u2013 there was barely space to move\non the dance \ufb02oor.\nAnd after an enjoyable set by Swingrowers that did a good job of getting the\ncrowd in the mood, we had to endure\n15 minutes of waiting before Caravan\nPalace (bear in mind that at this point,\nmyself and some others had been here\nfor over 2 \u00bd hours) themselves came\non \u2013 but when they did the excitement\ncoming from the crowd was amazing.\nWe were treated to some great scat\nfrom Hugues Payen, the violinist, in addition to the amazing voice of Zo\u00e9 Colotis and of course, I must mention the vibraphone solo that Paul-Marie Barbier\ntreated us to early on. As it turned out,\nthere wasn\u2019t nearly enough space on the\nSanchit Sharma Writer\n\ufb02oor to dance properly, so a lot of people ended up moshing. That was quite\nunexpected, and at \ufb01rst I thought this\nwasn\u2019t justi\ufb01ed for a swing concert. But\nwhen listening to swing as good as that\nfrom Caravan Palace, you really can\u2019t\nhelp but move to the beat in some way,\nand this was the simplest method available to most.\nUnfortunately, there were problems\nwith one song in particular, \u2018Je M\u2019amuse\u2019\n,\nwhich has backing vocals but no lead\nsinger. The band decided not to sing\nthe backing vocals and instead had the\naudience sing it, but as this was played\nquite early on people were not so happy\nto join in. As a result, the song felt quite\nincomplete.\nOne other thing that caused some\npeople problems, including the friend\nthat I went with, was the overuse of\nstrobe lighting, though it did make the\ndances look more impressive.\nOverall, I have to say that the concert\nwent by much too quickly. There was a\nmix of songs from both albums and the\natmosphere was powerful indeed. By\nthe end I was left wondering where the\ntime had gone, but very glad I\u2019d spent it\nthere.\nGet Katatonic with Dead End Kings\nWhenever I am asked which my\nfavourite Katatonia album is, my\nstandard response is to stare pensively into the distance for a moment and\nthen simply reply \u2018every Katatonia\nalbum\u2019. And now their ninth studio\nalbum Dead End Kings has entered\nthe equation... my answer remains\nthe same.\nSince their humble beginnings in\n1991, Katatonia\u2019s music has constantly evolved, whilst maintaining a con-sistent, uncompromising quality and\nabiding faithful to their melancholy\nconcept. This latest masterpiece of\nsumptuous, searching songs is certainly a far cry from their early doom/\ndeath days as a Swedish duo, taking\nthe underground by storm. Yet, their\ndarkness persists.\nI was totally captivated by this album within the \ufb01rst couple of seconds\nof the opening track, \u2018The Parting\u2019.\nThe cellos add an air of vulnerability\nand solemnity, which perfectly complements Jonas Renkse\u2019s heartfelt\nand powerful, clean vocal style. Their\nsound has developed into a distinct\nmixture of prog and melody, with\na sophisticated hint of gothic keyboards and orchestration. The songs\nare de\ufb01nitely catchy and the overall\nexecution is \ufb02awless, making this album very accessible, especially (I im-agine) for new Katatonia listeners.\nA constant feeling of emptiness\nand longing is exposed throughout\nthe album. This desolation is gravitated by the eloquence of the lyrics;\nmost notably in the exquisitely bleak\nsong, \u2018The One You Are Looking For\nIs Not Here ft. Silje Wergeland\u2019. The\nincreased abstraction and surrealism\nof the lyrics is an obvious change in\nthis album, focusing more on pure\nemotion and less on storytelling.\nEvery song appears to simply linger,\nuntil it fades into its successor. By far\nthe most sobering song on this album\nis \u2018Undo You\u2019; written by the only\nother original band member, lead\nguitarist Anders Nystr\u00f6m. It harks\nback to their 1995 EP For Funerals To\nCome. This track portrays the popular theme, amongst Katatonia songs,\nof our inescapable doom; whether\nJemma Pilcher Writer\nor not we positively turn our lives\naround, and achieve all that we want\nto, and become happy\u2026our death is\nstill inevitable. (Cheerful stu\ufb00!)\n\u201cOne of these days\nHours pass yet the night stays\nWhen your spirit won\u2019t turn anew\nThe world shuts down with no\ngoodbye to undo you.\u201d\nThe album artwork is as beautiful\nand bleak as the music itself. Again,\nharking back to earlier days of Brave\nMurder Day, the image of the dead\nbird is used. This bad omen reiterates the foreboding sense presented\nin the songs. This surreal, rural meets\nurban, landscape perhaps depicts\ntheir Dead End as a physical place;\nan icy white scene that has become\nblackened with pollution and a backdrop that is reminiscent of the Alfred\nHitchcock \ufb01lm.\nThis Monday, 10th December, Katatonia return to London as part of their\nhighly anticipated European Tour.\nThey will be performing alongside\nthe French shoegazing, concept band\nAlcest, o\ufb00 the back of their exquisite\nthird album Les Voyages de L\u2019\u00c2me,\nreleased earlier on this year, and Junius, an art rock band from Boston.\nI de\ufb01nitely urge anyone who is partial\nto doom and gloom to attend, as this\nis a line up not to be missed!\nAnders Nystr\u00f6m comments \u2013\n\u201cWe are very much looking forward\nto a tour that de\ufb01nitely stands out\nfrom the rest. Stare into November\u2019s\ndarkness with us! Be with us at the\nside of December\u2019s deathbed! Come\nmeet us at the chosen dead ends of\nEurope...\u201d\nSo, what should we expect next\nfrom the doom quintet? Will they\never return to the death days of old\nor continue to diverge down the prog\nroute? Or perhaps they really have\nbecome stuck in a Dead End... I sincerely doubt it.\nStereotypically metal cover\nFrench stereotype\n\n"

I really liked Julien as\nwell; he always put a smile on my\nface.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY Technology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nast Friday three young\nwhippersnappers (i.e. the\nFelix Tech team) made\ntheir way to the Gadget\nShow Live, in the ExCeL,\nhoping to see the newest tech on the\nmarket, as well as have some well-earned time o\ufb00. Once we arrived there\nand got our shiny press passes sorted\nout, we decided to split up so that each\nof us would have a di\ufb00erent view of\nwhat actually was going on in the tech\nworld.\nThe two biggest areas of the exhibition were given over to Microsoft and\nNintendo. This does \ufb01t with the conclusion that the companies who really need media attention to sell their\nproduct are going to try as hard as they\ncan, at every opportunity that is avail-able. Since I am not the Windows guy\nof the Tech team, and we had enough\ncoverage of Windows 8 anyway, I decided to skip out on the Microsoft\narea. On the other hand I was quite\nintrigued by the Nintendo stand, due\nto the recent release of the Wii U. As\nI made my way over to the large almost playground like area, it seems\nothers also had similar ideas. A larger\nthan life Mario and Luigi were walking\naround the area, uttering the occasional \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d, and in general\neverything was packed. The attention\nto detail was great, and I did have a go\non the Wii U for two games and managed to avoid the queue by waving my\nshiny press pass! (see page 42)\nAfter I had my \ufb01ll in Nintendo, I\ndecided that other parts of the Gadget Show also needed my attention.\nI walked over to EA (which was a\ncube thing) and looked into that, but\nI quickly decided that this would not\nbe worth my time, as several teen boys\nhad staked their territory in front of\nthe large FIFA 13 station, and were\nhogging it like their was no tomor-row. Anyway I thought that I had seen\ntoo much gaming already and needed\nto \ufb01nd some real cutting-edge tech to\nwrite about.\nSo I wandered around in search of\nsomething absolutely stunning, but\nthe majority of stands that I saw were\nbelow par to be honest. There were\nsome interesting things that caught\nmy eye and I kept their locations in\nmind, however at that given moment\nI was more into browsing the whole\narea than looking at speci\ufb01c things.\nOne of these was a portable projector,\na little beamer thing that you attached\nto your phone and it would project\nwhat was on your screen onto the wall.\nThe projection was a little faint, but\nit had to be kept in mind that it was\nquite bright in the hall. While I was\nplaying with the beamer with my iPhone (apparently it is compatible with\nany OS), I had some interesting things\nin mind. This technology if marketed\ncorrectly could replace the need for\ntelevisions. The majority of users who\nhave a smartphone have some kind of\nTV app on their device, be it Sky Go\nor BBC iPlayer. The only problem with\nwatching any program on their phone\nis the relative small size of their screen.\nYet with the mini projector, the area\nyou are watching becomes roughly the\nsame as the size of a medium sized TV.\nAfter my rendezvous with the projector I continued my stroll among\nthe stands. To my disappointment\nonly the minority of things were truly\nrevolutionary. The rest were either\ntoys for teens or for older men, who\nwill always remain children at heart.\nExamples of these were lego (lego at a\ntech show!?!), RC cars, RC helicopters\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n24\nL\nor battle robots (like the ones on Robot\nWars). I actually had a try and totally\ndominated my opposition (well....not\nreally). Anything that was not a toy or\nfor wellness was an accessory for your\nsmartphone. I would estimate about\n60% of the stands at the Gadget Show\nwere smartphone accessory related.\nThus when I met up again with the\ntech team to relay what I had seen, I\nwas actually quite disappointed. Luckily I had not payed the \u00a330 entry price\nfor the show, but I still felt somewhat\nripped o\ufb00. This exposition did not\nseem to want to display the newest\ntech, but rather advertise and sell the\nstu\ufb00 it already had. These thoughts\nwere echoed by the Tech writers, and\nwe all felt rather cheated. However we\ndecided to give it another try for you,\ndear reader, but this time, together so\nthat we could brave the disappointment as one.\nOn my previous meandering I had\nencountered some rare interesting\nthings, and therefore when neither\nJason (Tech Editor, who should actually have been in charge) nor Yong\nWen (the other Tech writer) put a viable point of interest forward, I took\ncharge (sigh) and guided them to what\nI thought was interesting. First port of\ncall was LG, and boy it did not disap-point. Not only did we get to see the\nworld\u2019s \ufb01rst 84\u201d Ultra HD TV, but then\nsaw something that was the absolute\nhighlight of the show. A TV that could\nshow two di\ufb00erent things at the same\ntime. Like with a 3D TV, when part of\nthe screen is polarised one way and an-other, the other way, it did this but with\ntwo totally di\ufb00erent screens. Jason and\nI both had a go, playing a racing game\n(I naturally won) where we saw di\ufb00erent things, like a split screen superim-posed.\nAfter this wonder, things were looking up, and the next place I lead to did\nnot disappoint either, i.e. Stone pa-per. Yes, you read correctly, stone pa-per. Made from Limestone instead of\ntrees, it has some bene\ufb01cial properties\ncompared to normal paper, and is environmentally friendly to boot! Writing on it was a bit strange, especially\nunder water, but its tear resistance and\nall round originality was very cool.\nWithout further ado the tech team\nhad bough a few booklets to test at\nhome! Next we had a look at a bunch\nof wiggly ears that move according to\nyour brainwaves. Although the actual\nuse of these things eluded us, we still\ndecided to have a look at these weird\ncontraptions. As we were listening to\nthe \u201csales person\u201d giving us his pitch,\nJason was wearing a pair of these pink\ncat ear things on his head. I watched\nwith fascination when the ears gave a\ntwitch every so often. After that rather\nfunny episode we made our way to the\n3D printer, where we watched a little\nstick man being created right in front\nof our eyes. Although 3D printers have\nbeen around for a while, this was the\n\ufb01rst time I had seen one and I thought\nit was quite amazing. The various\nmodels littering the table around the\nprinter were very di\ufb00erent, including\nmodel castles, balls and even a plastic chain that apparently could carry\na grown man (although I wouldn\u2019t imagine for very long). Shortly after we\nvisited a stand full of toilets, Yong Wen\nand me wanted to move on, but Jason\nwas quite intrigued by these porcelain\nthrones. The special thing about these\ntoilets is that they wipe your butt for\nyou (actually as Yong Wen put it: \u201cthey\nwash it gently with warm water, and\nthen dry it with hot air\u201d).\nAfter we had seen the most interesting things, it was not the turn of\nthe somewhat pointless contraptions\non which most people spend their\nhard earned money. We ridiculed the\nChristmas tree that sprayed styrofoam\nsnow, and wondered at its use.

Yet when\nwe actually took the e\ufb00ort to look\namong the little stands that the crowd\noverlooked we were pleasantly surprised at all the original stu\ufb00 that we\ngot to see. The big companies just want\nto get rid of what they have, instead of\nintroducing something new, as tried\nand tested is always better than going\nout on a limb. The little guys however\nhave nothing to lose. They don\u2019t have\nany old tech to rely on, instead trying\nto create their own market and show it\no\ufb00 to anybody who wants to see. All in\nall, I would have felt cheated if I would\nhave had to pay \u00a330 for the tickets,\neven though there was some nice stu\ufb00,\nhowever there wasn\u2019t enough to warrant such a relatively high price.\nFrom left to right: The best way to watch X-Factor; two men who take Movember way too seriously; A visual metaphor for most men\u2019s internet history; and a 3D printer model, Library computers won\u2019t connect\nWe went to the Gadget Show\nMax Eggl and the Felix Tech team play around on some of the latest tech\n... attached to\nyour phone\nand it projects\nwhat is on\nyour screen\nonto the wall\n\u201d\n\u201c\nabout 60%\nof the stands\nat the Gadget\nShow were\nsmartphone\naccessory related\n\n"

This evil ocotopus doodle is the brainchild of Umar\nHossain.\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n30\nThis autumn, a new theatre company has joined the ranks of the prestigious London scene: the Michael\nGrandage Company (MGC). Born\nfrom the union of two notorieties\nof the UK repertoire, artistic director Michael Grandage and executive producer James Bierman, this\nnew troop has only just revealed its\nfirst 15-month season of five plays\nthat will be nestled in the heart of\nthe West End at the Noel Coward\ntheatre.\nThere are a few things here that\nare worth saying about this new\ncompany and why this is an exciting\ndevelopment.\nFirst, Michael Grandage has an\naward-winning track record from\nhis previous position as artistic director at the Donmar Warehouse.\nTo translate this into a comparable figure, Grandage is the theatre\nequivalent of, say, Christopher Nolan: he turns almost every production into an acclaimed, fresh, yet\ntasteful gem. Second, the season\nwill feature a sensational mix of\nwell-established celebrities including Judi Dench, Daniel Radcliffe and\nJude Law, as much as new up-and-coming actors like Sam Swainsbury.\nThird, in order to appeal to a wide\nmass of cosmopolites, MGC is offering no less than 100,000 tickets for \u00a310 only across its season.\nThat\u2019s 200 out of the 950 seats of\nthe venue for a tenner for each per-formance. With such a renowned\ntrack record, why would MGC be\ntaking such a cut? Primarily to send\na clear message about what it wants\nto be known for: the new kid on the\nblock whose every play will make\nit on your must-see list. Aiming to\ncomplement the seasons of the likes\nof the National Theatre, the Almeida and the Old Vic, MGC\u2019s policy\nopens the door to younger theatre-goers and students while still promising high quality productions.\nFourth, MGC will be performing\nfor free across London schools and\ncolleges, launching an education\nprogramme tagged \u2018MGC Future\u2019 to\nintroduce young people to theatre.\nIn the same spirit, for each play the\ncompany will seek to hire starting\ndirectors and designers as part of\na training scheme, giving new stars\nthe chance to shine. If the price tag\nalone did nothing to convince you,\nit must surely be good to support a\ncompany that does not perpetuate\nthe uptight standards that theatres\noften seem to uphold.\nOh, and I almost forgot: the set\nfive plays, starting this December,\nall promise to be captivating! I suggest jumping on one \u2013 if not all \u2013 of\nthese opportunities within the next\nyear:\nPrivates on Parade, on first, features Simon Russell Beale as drag-queen army Captain Dennis in Peter Nichols\u2019 comedy, which is set\nagainst the murderous backdrop of\nthe Malaysian campaign at the end\nof the Second World War.\nPeter and Alice, starting in March,\nand starring Judi Dench and Ben\nWhishaw, hypothesizes on the\nmeeting between Alice Liddell Hargreaves and Peter Llewelyn Davies\n\u2013 the two children who inspired\nCaroll and Barrie to respectively\nwrite Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan.\nThe final play of the (school) year,\nThe Cripple Of Inishmaan begins in\nJune. Have you ever wondered how\nDaniel Radcliffe would fare without\na wand and a sizzling scar? Look\nno further. He will be taking on the\nlead role for this play: a young disabled man living on a remote island\non the West Coast of Ireland set to\nbecome a movie star when a Hollywood production comes to shoot on\nan island nearby.\nFor more information on how to obtain one of those \u00a310 tickets go to\nhttp://www.michaelgrandagecom-pany.com\nEmilie Beauchamp Writer\nIf you are a fan of extraordinary theatrical experiences and still have room\non your Christmas gift list, have a\nlook at the world acclaimed show\nFuerzabruta passing by London next\nJanuary.

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nPodcasting arrives,\nwell, sort of...\nThe implementation of video lecture recordings across the College has been a\nhot topic for discussion of late. Although\nvideo lectures have been piloted in Imperial for certain years in certain depart-ments, the scheme is not yet available to\nall students.\nThe Panopto lecture recording suite\nis being implemented over a three year\nplan across the College. However, the\nenthusiasm exhibited by departments\nvaries drastically. Although College need\nto allay sta\ufb00 fears to ensure students in\ncertain departments are not disadvantaged by lecturers not participating in\nthis scheme. Members of the Union have\npraised the College for the introduction\nof online lectures as they believe it will\nenable students to revise better and be\nan attractive plus point for prospective\nstudents.\nVideo podcasts can help students consolidate their learning, particularly students whose \ufb01rst language is not English\nor those who \ufb01nd note taking di\ufb03cult.\nThe scheme should ideally be available\nto all students, both undergraduates as\nwell as taught postgraduates; especially\nas this academic year the number of incoming postgraduates exceeded under-graduates.\nThe College is behind international\ncompetitors such as MIT in the delivery\nof video lectures. Other UK institutions\nsuch as Cambridge, UCL, Manchester\nand Oxford have podcasts and video\nlectures to aid in learning. Manchester\nis one of the Universities that was shortlisted for the Times Higher Education\nAwards 2012 for the Outstanding ICT\nInitiative of the Year award. Furthermore, Manchester is also running workshops to educate participants about the\nbest practice in the use of lecture capture\nin teaching and learning.\nFelix caught up with the Chemistry\nDepartment to learn about the use of\ntechnology in lectures. Alan Spivey, Director of Undergraduate Studies, commented on the fact several sta\ufb00 have\nproduced podcasts of their undergraduate lectures. As well as this, a series of\none-o\ufb00 \u201cresearch highlights\u201d lectures\nhave been recorded as podcasts. \u201cThere\nare several factors limiting further ex-pansion. The process for getting these\nrecordings approved by Comms and\nNida Mahmud News Editor uploaded to the College i-TunesU site is\nnot as straightforward as would be ideal\nand their uploader does not support enhanced podcasts. The slow emergence of\ntoolstoallowlecturerstoassessthelikely\nbene\ufb01t and IP/copyright position of prospective recordings is another factor.\nWith the introduction of Panopto recording facilities into many College lec-turetheatres,theopportunityformaking\npodcasts has increased and the energy\nbarrier to do this has also decreased. The\nmain advantage of the iTunes-U format\nover Panopto is the compatibility with\nmobile devises as I see it\u201d\nDoug Hunt, Deputy President (Edu-cation) said: \u201cOther Russell Group Universities are o\ufb00ering audiovisual lecture\npodcasts to their students and to stop\nImperial students being dissatis\ufb01ed, we\nshould be installing it across our lecture\ntheatres as quick as possible, while putting enough resources behind training\nacademics to use it.\nIt needs to be rapidly rolled out to\nprevent some students in certain departments and years who are not receiving it,\nbecoming disgruntled and the College\nneeds to handle its implementation, the\nbest it can by e\ufb00ectively communicating\nwith all students on this issue.\u201d\nThe Business School currently has\nvideo lectures. Other departments such\nas Chemistry and Maths are piloting it.\nThe Chemistry pilot is focused on \ufb01rst\nand second years. The issues that have\nbeen raised by sta\ufb00 include: intellectual\nproperty, decline in student attendance\nto lectures, illegal distribution, rights of\nstudents asking questions, the time taken to upload the videos and the cost incurred due to installation. Other department speci\ufb01c issues, such as for physics,\ninclude the cost of \ufb01lming equipment for\nthe di\ufb00erent boards; but a student has\nsuggested the lecture can be \ufb01lmed by a\nstudent moving with the board.\nA screenshot of Panopto \u2013 where all podcasts can be found\nUCL piloted a programme of lecture\nrecordings in 2008/09 to determine if\nthere was a requirement for a podcasting\nservice.Thesuccessofthepilothasledto\nUCL investing in recording equipment\nfor lecture theaters. They found:\n\u2022 \u201cThe sta\ufb00 felt that podcasting had\nadded value to their teaching and\nwould recommend it to others.\n\u2022 85% of student respondents\nagreed or strongly agreed that\npodcasts aided understanding of\nthe module.\n\u2022 91% agreed or strongly agreed\nAll too small scale rollout\nVideo podcasting is undoubtably\nbeneficial for students here at Imperial College, as well as potentially\nbeneficial to the Imperial College\nbrand.\nThe reason I campaigned for podcasting is because I believe it can\nsignificantly improve the student\nlearning experience and further enhance students understanding of key\nconcepts taught at university.\nStudents can\u2019t always grasp concepts or all content during a lecture,\neither they have momentary lapses\nin concentration or can\u2019t quite pick\nthings up as fast as some. Through\nre-watching, these students can pick\nup what they missed out on, as well\nas reinforce previous understanding,\nthis aiding their understanding on\nthe whole.\nThere were really just two main\nqualms I\u2019ve come across that have\nhindered a significantly large scale\nrollout of podcasting, although we\nsuccessfully achieved a small scale\nrollout that I believe has gone suc-cessfully. The first was attendance\nand the second, a more significant\nreason, was cost.\nThe first problem I came across\nwere claims, or worries, that attendance would fall. However, I saw no\nevidence what-so-ever for this being\ntrue, to the contrary, I was actually\ntold of evidence that it had no effect\nat all by lecturers who had piloted\nit and also from the business school\nwho have had lecture captures for\nseveral years now.\nInterestingly, the statistics from the\nBusiness School showed large spikes\nin re-watches of lectures during re-vision, as students re-watched specific parts of lectures to refine their\nunderstanding or lectures they had\nin fact attended. Some students also\ndo use the system to re-watch missed\nlectures, often as they are unable to\nmake it due to other commitments\n(e.g. job interviews), not because\nthey\u2019re lazy. All-in-all if students are\ngoing to miss lectures, they are going\nto miss lectures, regardless of whether the lectures are recorded or not.\nThe more significant of the two\nproblems is cost.\nThis is what I believe is the real reason there hasn\u2019t been a significantly\nlarge scale podcasting initiative introduced (although, again, I want\nreiterate there has been a small-scale\nrollout this year).\nThe cost, depending on how large\nthe project, could be very large for\nthe College to bear.\nWith the large expansion of the\nCollege to Imperial West and not to\nmention gigantic government cuts,\nit\u2019s understandable that the College\nhas had to tighten its belt.\nAlthough we are told that the Collegeisfocusingonthestudentexperi-ence, it would appear that the budget\nfor this focus is minimal, which, although annoying, is understandable.\nFor us to live up to what we are often referred to ,\u201cthe MIT of the UK\u201d,\nwe would need a big injection of cash\nto rollout the system for all lectures,\nin all lecture theatres at the College\nand also expand our ICT resources &\nstaffing as well as departmental staff\nto manage the large system.\nOverall, at the moment, I feel\nthat podcasting is underway on the\nsmall scale and has the potential for\na large full scale rollout in the next 5\nyears. However, until there\u2019s a bigger\nbudget to be spend on the student\nexperience we\u2019ll have to be happy\nwith smaller scale podcasting projects within some departments that\nchoose to adopt it.\nJason Parmar \u201c\n\u201d\n... until there\u2019s a bigger\nbudget to be spend on\nthe student experience\nwe\u2019ll have to be happy\nwith smaller scale podcasting projects within\nsome departments\nthat podcasts would be useful for\nrevision \u2013 one student noted that\nthe podcasts were \u2018probably the\nbest form of revision material I\nhave come across\u2019\n.\n\u2022 Some students noted they helped\nsupport di\ufb00erent learning styles.\n\u2022 Students valued the opportunity to clarify topics and concepts\nwhich had been missed during\nthe class, and to improve their\nnotes.\n\u2022 A number of students asked for\n\u2018podcasting in every lecture.\u201d\nDeputy President (Education) 2011-12\nTim Arbabzadah\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

As an intrigued listener, I\ntried to get into them but found I really\ncouldn\u2019t stand them whatsoever. After\nlistening to Arc, I\u2019m not quite sure where\nI stand.\nLeading single \u2018Cough Cough\u2019 is a\npowerhouse of percussion and jittery\nsynthesiser; the perfect song to reappear with after a two year hiatus. After\nlistening to this album opener, I was beginning to doubt my initial cynicism. Next up is \u2018Kemosabe\u2019, which I found\neven more impressive in melody and structure. The song constantly changes\nits direction, getting better at each turn \u2013 so much so that I was even close\nto \u201cliking\u201d Everything Everything\u2019s Facebook page. And then something hap-pens. Arc stops being as brilliant as the first two songs would suggest.\nNext song \u2018Torso of the Week\u2019 is bizarre in a way that I feel Everything Everything does best, but not in a good way. Named after a column in Heat mag-azine, the song is uninteresting musically and tries too hard with its quirky\nlyrical content. \u2018Choice Mountain\u2019 starts off very promising with some lovely\nstaccato guitars, all going to waste as the song ends up dragging on.\nThe back end of the album features the only other songs to tickle my fancy\non Arc, with everything in between boring the shit out of me. \u2018Radiant\u2019 is a\ntriumph of glittery guitars, while \u2018Don\u2019t Try\u2019 is as nice and catchy as you\u2019d\nexpect, without Everything Everything\u2019s trademark silliness.\nOut of all the indie bands with an electronic leaning, I feel Friendly Fires\nand Dutch Uncles do a better job than Everything Everything- the former\nalso with an album out in January. Judging by the success of the first single, I\ndon\u2019t doubt that Arc will do very well in the charts. If you enjoyed their 2010\ndebut Man Alive, chances are you\u2019re not already irritated by Everything Everything so you\u2019ll probably enjoy Arc too.\nYasmin Malik\nNeurosis in conversation\nRiaz Agahi talks to Scott Kelly about Neurosis and his solo work\nOne of the most in\ufb02uential bands out\nthere, progressive sludge out\ufb01t Neurosis have left their mark on the metal\nscene and anyone who\u2019s seen their live\nperformance. After seeing an impressive show of theirs at ATP, I was able to\nspeak to Scott Kelly of Neurosis about\nNeurosis\u2019 decision to remove visuals\nfrom their live set, his solo project and\nthe post metal scene.\nRA: The most striking question I\nthink is about the changes to your live\nset. What led you to think it was time\nfor a change?\nSK: It was a mutual thing and we just\nreached a point where we didn\u2019t feel\ninspired to have visuals anymore, and\nJosh really didn\u2019t feel like doing them\nanymore, he didn\u2019t want to be a pro-jectionist. I think he wants to focus on\nhis band.\nWe wanted to do something di\ufb00erent, we wanted to take it back to where\nwe were 20 years ago and just revisit\nthe whole idea. I\u2019m not sure whether\nwe\u2019re gonna go back to doing visuals or\nnot, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re just kind of starting at zero and seeing what it brings\nus and it actually was good to get out\nand do it.\nRA: Do you feel that your solo project is a way of catharsis for another\naspect of your personality?\nSK: It is for sure. It\u2019s something that\u2019s\nkind of developed over the years as I\u2019ve\nbeen working on it. For me, music or\nany kind of creative process is an act\nof submitting to whatever will become\nof the songs and you don\u2019t really try to\nguide them as much as you let them\nguide you. So I don\u2019t really question\nthe lyrical content. I question more the\nmelody and the sound of things. The\nacoustic music just tends to bring this\nwhole other aspect of who I am and\nmy experience to light.\nRA: Was there any change of approach with Honor Found In Decay?\nSK: Not really, we always look to let\nthe music write itself. I think that we\nwere focusing on our dynamics quite\na lot on this record and trying to create more extreme dynamics within our\nsound, just basically get better at what\nwe do. The recording process itself was\nthe same as we\u2019ve had for the past 5 records with Steve Albini in his studio.\nSame time frame, same place, same\nengineer. That\u2019s remained the same\nand probably will for a while. That\u2019s\nsomething that really works for us.\nRA: With Neurosis, you write lyrics\nthat are primal yet inward looking and\ndeep, what process do you go through\nwriting them?\nSK: It\u2019s pretty much open to your\ninterpretation. We\u2019re de\ufb01nitely not\nsitting down with a message or a vision for what the lyrics should contain or what we should be imparting\nto people. We just trust the spirit of\nthe whole thing, we just believe that\nthe words that should be there will be\nthere.\nTypically, it starts o\ufb00 with a tone\nor melody of sorts where I\u2019ll hear the\nwords or what they should sound like\nand then just decipher it and then I\njust go through that process a number of times until I feel it\u2019s at the point\nwhere they should be.

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n54\nNetball girls on a roll\nOn Monday IC 2nds took on RHUL\n3rds away, and it truly was away. A\ntube, two trains and a 12 minute walk\nlater we arrived. Funny that this was\na LUSL game for London Universities\nand we were playing in Kent some-where, needless to say we were very un-impressed. With freezing cold temperatures and only 7 players, we weren\u2019t\nexactly excited about the next hour.\nThe \ufb01rst quarter started out slowly\nwith the cold clearly taking its toll on\neveryone\u2019s brain function, neither\nIC nor RHUL had anything much to\nshout about. We started to pull away\ncapitalising on RHUL mistakes, thanks\nto some fantastic interceptions from,\nsmallest player on the team, Emily\nRolfe. It was clear that our new \u201c\ufb02ing a\nlimb\u201d tactic was working, with IC arms\n\ufb02ailing everywhere we were making it\ndi\ufb03cult for RHUL to string together\nany signi\ufb01cant number of passes.\nThe second quarter started o\ufb00 well\nwith about 5 goals in a row from IC,\nimpressive cross-court dives from Rebecca Tyne ensured that no loose ball\nwent to waste. RHUL 3rds were slow\nto pick up on our pattern of play and\ncentres repeatedly went from Abi, to\nBeverley, to Emily, to Harriet to goal.\nAt this point the umpires decided to\nbecome extra strict on our team and\nwe were called up for some very dubious \u201cball control.\u201d However, a lack\nof keeping up with the new rules also\nworked in our favour with RHUL\u2019s GD\nbeing blown up for marking o\ufb00 court.\nThe end of the second quarter and we\nwere pulling further away.\nIC 2s vs RHUL 3s\nThe day started o\ufb00 eventfully, with\nsnow delaying all trains to Egham.\nWhen we arrived with 7 players, already at a disadvantage, crossing our\n\ufb01ngers there would be no other in-cidents, two of our players were told\nthey couldn\u2019t play because of piercings that needed to be taken out. According to said players these piercings\nwere \u2018impossible\u2019 to take out. \u2018You\nneed pliers\u2019 \u2018you can push it through\nmy ear\u2019 \u2018someone just pull it out\u2019\n\u2018there\u2019s blood\u2019. After multiple attempts\nwe managed, as a team, to remove all\nearrings and play commenced as the\nclock struck 3, with the Sun blinding\nplayers eyes even in the freezing con-ditions.\nThe \ufb01rst quarter started o\ufb00 eventfully with some strong interceptions\nfrom new player Kirstin and some\ngood shooting from Izzie. The score at\nthe end of the quarter didn\u2019t re\ufb02ect the\nlevel of competition with them leading\n13-8. In the second quarter, the slippy\ncourt and an over zealous shooter got\nthe best of Laura, and she went tumbling slamming her knee into the ce-ment, which could be heard from the\nother side of the court. Play stopped\nand she was carried by 6 people, including both umpires, o\ufb00 the court.\nShe managed to bandage herself up\n(what do medics need 6 years for?)\nand play continued with only 6 players.\nTwo goals were scored in quick suc-cession, showing RHUL that we were a\nforce to be reckoned with. That quarter\nended with RHUL 21-14.\nLaura had managed to create a bandage strong enough to hold what was\nleft of her knee together and hobbled\non court. Despite her injuries she managed some fantastic interceptions,\ncausing players and umpires to applaud\nher courage and determination. The\nfourth quarter opened with a swift interception from Kate, leading to a goal\nfor IC. The game ended as the last of\nthe sun disappeared behind the trees,\nwith a disappointing loss for IC, but\nready and full of fury to take on Brunel\n6s next Wednesday.\nIC 3s vs KCL 3s\nLast Monday IC 1sts played in their\nsecond LUSL cup match of the season against LSE 3rds in Ethos. With a\nfew key players missing Nancy Edge\nand Amelia Al-Qazzaz stepped up\nto the plate having their first team\ndebuts. With the centre court being completely re-modelled no one\nwas quite sure how the team would\nperform and this showed in a shaky\nfirst quarter. The passing was slow\nand inaccurate with many mistakes\nbeing made by both teams but IC\nmanaged to gain a small advantage.\nIn the second quarter with some\namazing interceptions by Verity\nRoberts and Sophie Andrew in defence the game flowed a little more\nand IC started to pull ahead. Tereze\nGaile and Amelia Al-Qazzaz were\nsteadily bringing the ball from defence to attack and IC was on a roll\nfinishing the quarter well ahead.\nIn the third quarter the team really did start to shine. Nancy Edge\nprovided some perfect passes into\nthe circle and Tamar Loach was on\nfire (as usual) never missing a shot!\nIC 1s vs LSE 3s\nFelix Sport gets the lowdown on netball\u2019s continued success\nThe final quarter was almost a for-mality; the play dipped in quality as\nthe win became inevitable and some\nvery silly mistakes were made. The\ntarget of 80 wasn\u2019t quite reached but\neveryone was pleased with a final\nscore of IC 70, LSE 23. The 1sts next\nLUSL cup match is against Royal\nHolloway 1sts in January, which\npromises to be a slightly more challenging game. The IC 1sts are flying\nthe flag for imperial as they are the\nlast IC (non-medic) netball team in\na cup this season so make sure you\ncome and support them if you get a\nchance.\nThe 3rd quarter came and we all\nstarted to relax a bit, the game wasn\u2019t\nvery intense and we were ahead by\nenough. Catherine Burrows employed\na new \u201cpencil jumping\u201d technique that\nwas hugely e\ufb00ective against their goal\nshooter, and she was almost cut out of\nthe game. Great shooting from both\nBeverly Tsang and Harriet Rumgay ensured that every opportunity was tak-en, although we did have some fancy\nfootwork from Harriet who seemed to\nthink we were doing some dancing.\nIt was the \ufb01nal quarter and RHUL\nhad just been promised Nando\u2019s by\ntheir coach if they managed to get it\nback and win, unfortunately no one\nwas o\ufb00ering to take IC out for dinner for being consistently awesome.\nSloppy play and agitation from RHUL\nmeant that goal attack was blown up\nfor contacting Toni Semmence a lot,\nbut no amount of bruises were going to make IC back down now. If we\nweren\u2019t getting Nando\u2019s no one would\nbe.v Domineering play in the centre\ncourt from Abigail Johnston Hume ensured that our lead only increased. Unfortunately the \ufb01nal score is currently\nunknown because as soon as the \ufb01nal\nwhistle blew IC were o\ufb00 court, grabbing our stu\ufb00 and sprinting to the train\nstation so we didn\u2019t have to wait half an\nhour for the next train. A rash shout\nby Toni stating she\u201d knew which carriage to get on so we have to walk less\nat Wimbledon\u201d ended up being a 100%\nwrong and IC 2nds were forced to walk\nthe entire length of the platform.\nReach! Climb every mountain!\nReach! Reach for the moon!\nICUNC have had a fantastic start to\nthe season especially in the BUCS\nleagues, with the 1sts currently 2nd in\ntheir league and with promotion still\nvery much in their grasps.\nThe 2nds are still joint top and promotion could easily come down to\nthe last game of the season against\nQM 2nds. IC 3rds are currently holding a strong mid-table position and\nwith some strong play in the return\n\ufb01xtures, promotion is still on the\ncards. In the new LUSL league IC\nhave 5 teams competing for the \ufb01rst\ntime.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER 31\nAt what point does someone become a national treasure? This is\nthe question Alan Bennett must\nhave been asking himself when writing People, his latest play, which\npremiered at the National Theatre\nlast month. Bennett, who has been\nworking in the world of theatre for\nmore than 50 years, is Britain\u2019s most\nwell known playwright, and arguably\none of the best. Responsible for The\nHistory Boys and The Habit of Art,\nBennett has come to represent modern British drama; People continues\nin this tradition, centring around the\nidea of national institutions, class\ndivides, and the death of the English\ncountry house.\nPeople\u2019s plot centres around a\nlarge mansion, located near where\nBennett grew up, in South Yorkshire. The house is unmanageable,\nexpensive to run, and inhabited by a\npair of old women, Dorothy and Iris\n(played by Frances de la Tour and\nLinda Bassett respectively), who are\nslowly atrophying in the large drawing room. Dorothy does not want\nto get rid of the house, but realises\nthat it is inevitable if she is to sur-vive. She has a number of options;\na cinema company want to use it to\nshoot a pornographic film, there has\nbeen interest from a group of Japanese businessmen, and others wish\nto turn it into a golf course, but at\nthe centre of the struggle there are\ntwo major players. There is a group\nof investors, dubbed \u2018The Concern\u2019,\nwho want to move the building to\nDevon, and the National Trust, who\nwant to open it to the public. Both\nof these options would allow Dorothy to carry on living in the house,\nbut she does not want the house to\nchange. All she really wants is running water and privacy.\nFrances de la Tour shines as Dorothy, portraying a woman who is trying to hold on to her dignity, but is\ncompletely powerless. Put under\npressure by \u2018The Concern\u2019, \u2018The\nTrust\u2019, and her nagging sister, a deacon in the Church of England, Dorothy tries to hang on to her slowly\ncrumbing house with all her might.\nWhen asked by Mr Lumsden, a representative of the Trust, whether\nshe wants the house to progress or\nnot, she simply replies that \u2018decay\nis a form of progress\u2019. Much of the\nplay is focussed on the idea of trying\nto hang on to the past, warning of a\nnear-future where the stately home\nhas simply become a pastiche of a\nbygone age.\nIn the work, Bennett delivers an\nacerbic attack upon UK institutions;\nthe Church, and the middle classes\nget hit pretty heavily, but it is the\nNational Trust that received the\nbrunt of the criticism. It is portrayed\nas a multi-armed monster, grabbing\nat any buildings which may be in\nthe public interest, and delivering\na tacky, artificial representation of\nhistory. In one memorable scene Mr\nLumsden talks about how the trust\nis planning on acquiring the Maze\nPrison in Northern Ireland and recreating the \u2018dirty protest\u2019 staged by\nIRA prisoners during the Troubles.\nThis treatment of the past clearly\nmisery to Dorothy.\nWhile Bennett\u2019s witty attacks\nagainst institutions are convincing,\none must take them with a pinch of\nsalt; after all, Bennett himself is an\ninstitution of British theatre, and\nhaving lived in North London for\nthe last few decades, he may have\nmore in common with the middle\nclass than he cares to admit. But\nPeople should not be taken too se-riously; it is after all a comedy, and\na damn good one too. The set and\nlighting are excellent, as is to be\nexpected from the National Theatre, and Nicholas Hynter\u2019s sublime\ndirection helps elevate what would\nbe a light comedy into a real work\nof art. While Bennett may be trying\nto escape becoming a national treas-ure, this work does not do him any\nfavours; if anything it simply further\nentrenches his role as king of British\ntheatre.\nhorrifies Bennett, who closes the\nplay with the line \u2018let what is gone be\ngone, and not fetched back\u2019. Bennett\nis describing a world where \u2018Britain\nis at a standstill\u2019, obsessed with the\npast, and unable to move forward.\nThe Trust, for Bennett at least, also\nrepresents its target market: the\nmiddle classes, who are described\nas \u2018the shockable ones\u2019. The idea\nof swathes of middle class parents\nwandering through the house brings\nDealing with Trust issues\nMeredith Thomas Arts Editor\nFred Fyles Writer\nMinotaurs and major excursions\nThe Architect is Shunt\u2019s \ufb01rst production in three years and it was well\nworth the wait. Shunt is an unusual\ncollective centred round an experimental theatre company. The group\nhave had a presence around East London for years. Some readers might\njust remember the astonishing club\nthey ran in the tunnels under London Bridge station of the same name.\nIt was amazing folks; the only dance\n\ufb02oor I have ever graced where one of\nthe major dangers was drunk rickshaw\ndrivers. The core work of Shunt however has always been theatre and so,\nas I traipsed my way into the wilds of\nBermondsey to their new hideout in\nan abandoned biscuit factory, I was\nmore than a little excited.\nI am nervous about revealing too\nmuch about the show. So much of its\ne\ufb00ectiveness relied on surprise, misdirection and disorientation, done\nwith such \ufb01nesse that the audience are\nhardly aware. There is a fear that whatever I tell you would subtract from\nyour enjoyment should you choose,\nand I recommend that you do, to get\ntickets. Nevertheless, I have a job to\ndo so here goes.\nThe Architect was wilfully and consistently bizarre. The entire performance incorporated live music, in-stallation, aerial performers, acting,\ncomedy and a good amount of drink-ing, all from a cast of barely ten. I was\nshocked, terri\ufb01ed, bewildered and\namused in turn due to an atmosphere\nand sense of spectacle that were perfectly engineered on an astonishing\nscale.\nAudience participation normally\n\ufb01lls me with dread. Too often it can\nseem contrived and actually serves as\na barrier to an immersive experience.\nThe the cast managed it perfectly.\nThis was probably because, despite\nthe scale of the venture, the set being\nseveral times the size of their last show\nMoney, the entire enterprise retains a\nplayful, amateurish feel.\nI have mentioned the scale, and it is\nastounding. One of the inspirations\nfor the show was Jorge Luis Borges\u2019\nshort story The House of Asterion,\nwhich is itself based upon the legend of the Minotaur. To re\ufb02ect this,\nyou enter the venue through a claustrophobic plywood labyrinth. The\nspace is genuinely hard to navigate,\n\ufb01lled with bizarre items. After some\nstruggle you reach as door and passing through, \ufb01nd yourself, quite suddenly in the dining hall of a cruise ship\n(complete with bar) where much of\nthe action takes place.\nThe true genius of the show is caught\nin glimpses amongst the madness and\nby picking apart the allegory in the\nnarrative. Odd thematic motifs recur\nand interact with varying degrees of\nsymbolic opacity. In addition to the\na Minotaur myth, there are clear references to the credit crunch and the\nEuropean debt crisis as well as other\nclassical sources. The show may be\nsilly and occasionally obscene, but it is\nmost certainly not unintelligent.\nA large part of my brain will be dedicated to going over my own interpretations of the performance for some\ntime to come. Do not go if you are\nafraid of the dark, or cows.\nThe pain of\nGothic piles...\nCatherine Ashmore\n\n"

Then why not take a trip to the\nHunterian Museum? Hidden away inside the Royal College of Surgeons in\nHolborn, it is the ultimate destination\nto explore all the gory details of animal\nbiology, and satisfy any morbid curiosities about surgery, disease and the\nhuman body.\nThe Hunterian Museum has existed\nin some form since way back in 1799,\nand was originally made up of the\nenormous and creepy collection of\nthe pioneering (that is, not medically\ntrained) surgeon John Hunter. Now\nthe exhibition comprises more than\n3,500 di\ufb00erent anatomical and pathological artefacts, from over 500 di\ufb00erent species, from a 6 inch skeleton of\na human foetus to an exceedingly long\npig epididymis. Highlights include the 7ft 7 skeleton of \u2018Irish\nGiant\u2019 Charles\nByrne (who\nrather upset-tingly asked in his\nwill to be buried at\nsea, speci\ufb01cally so\nthat he wouldn\u2019t end\nup in a museum), and\nthe bound foot bones\nof a Chinese concubine\n\u2014 gruesome enough to\nmake any modern woman feel bad complaining\nabout high heels.

A pilot event for the\nsociety and run in collaboration with\nImperial Hub & The Student Led\nProjects symposium, the conference\nbrought together senior business\nleaders from investment banks, start\nup social entrepreneurs and student\nprojects \u2013 with a series of speeches,\nworkshops and a sponsorship pitching session with \u00a3750 up for grabs.\nSponsorship isn\u2019t as simple as writing a document, emailing a \ufb01rm and\ngetting money for projects and soci-eties. Students nationwide learned\nabout the unique approaches and\nstrategies used by ICFS in developing and maintaining extraordinarily\nclose partnerships with over 33 \ufb01rms\n\u2013 the key themes being professionalism without elitism, a small exec committee with tight sponsorship control,\naccountability and of course informality \u2013 when in doubt, make a cool YouTube video! Projects had the chance\nto hear from ICFS sponsors such as\nNomura on why they support the society and the key takeaway message: If\nyou want funding for a student-pro-ject \u2013 don\u2019t act like a student but act\nlike a corporate!\nWith keynote presentations from\nNomura and Ernst & Young, students witnessed \ufb01rst-hand the kind of\nCSR projects such \ufb01rms fund \u2013 from\nthe Rainbow Trust to EY\u2019s extensive\nportfolio of social enterprises. The\nRainbow Trust mentioned how they\nwere successful in becoming the charity partner for Nomura and raising\n\u00a3500,000 in just a year \u2013 just through\nemployee engagement and matched\ngiving (where the \ufb01rm matches any\ndonation made by an employee to a\ncharity). Following this, students had\nthe exclusive chance to listen to the\nUK Head of Corporate Citizenship\nat Ernst & Young \u2013 who highlighted\nkey projects in entrepreneurship, education & environment totalling \u00a35.1\nmillion of UK sponsorship in the past\nyear.\nThe highlight of the speeches was\nundoubtedly John Grisby, a social\nentrepreneur who co-founded DNA\nPerformance \u2013 an organisation aimed\nat \ufb01nding and educating the next generation of business leaders for CSR\nstyle projects. In John\u2019s landmark\nspeech \u2013 he touched on the issue of\n\u201cself-awareness\u201d \u2013 you might think\nyou\u2019re a pro \u2013 but your sponsors may\nnot! Reviewing, re\ufb02ecting and adapting your team to drive sustained performance is key to securing long-term\ninvestment and sponsorship. It\u2019s as\nmuch about emotional intelligence\nas it is about having competitive and\nunique technical skills.\nSound words of advice indeed. Following the presentations, projects\nhad the chance to network and prepare for their sponsorship pitches\nin workshops run by Stuart Arnott\n(Mindings) and Rhiannon Horsley\n(from our very own Imperial Hub) on\nwriting business plans in a 9-fold concept as well as the critical attributes\nof emotion, conveying a story, succinctness and passion in pitches for\nsponsorship. With over 10 projects\nvying for \u00a3750 worth of sponsorship\n\u2013 these workshops gave them valuable\nfeedback on their business plans and\nexisting proposals \u2013 preparing them\nfor the main event: The Sponsorship\nPitching competition.\nWith \u00a3750 of ICFS Sponsorship up\nfor grabs in a competition with 10\nstrong student-led projects from Imperial College, Loughborough University, UCL & Liverpool University\n\u2013 the high stakes pitching challenge\nwas the highlight of the day. Judged by\nbusiness representatives from Inside\nBuzz, John Grisby, Stuart Arnott and\nRhiannon Horsley, projects had just\nthree minutes to covey their ideas,\nhopes, dreams and ambitions to our\npanel \u2013 with immediate feedback.\nFrom societies to social enterprises,\neach pitch was unique and it was up to\nthe judges to answer the critical ques-tion: Who should we invest in Who\nhas what it takes to stand up and do\na pitch?\nThe Imperial College El Salvador\nproject (working on critical construction projects overseas) left the judges\nimpressed with their quick-\ufb01re ability\nto turn an engineering project into a\nviable social enterprise proposition\n\u2013 walking away with the top prize of\n\u00a3500. The Kenyan Orphan project \u2013\nsupporting health, welfare and education in Kenya \u2013 similarly impressed\nwith their personal and passionate\npitch; winning \u00a3250 of sponsorship.\nMany congratulations not only to the\nwinning projects but to all 10 who\npitched on the day \u2013 they all received\nvaluable feedback from sponsorship\npitching veterans and no doubt this\nwill help in the future!\nStudent Hubs\u2019 CEO Adam O\u2019Boyle\nclosed the conference with an eye-opening speech into the foundation\nand impact of Student Hubs \u2013 the\numbrella organisation behind Imperial Hub this year.

No doubt\nyou are reading this already\nsnuggled up warm in your\nknitted jumper complete with\nreindeer design, sipping mulled wine\nand getting positively drunk on the\nfestive cheer. Of course you aren\u2019t; you\nare like any other Imperial student-walled up in the Library, slowly chewing your arm o\ufb00. However, who said\nscience can\u2019t be joyous? Spice up your\nChristmas dinner banter with some of\nthese festive facts, or use them to tell\nthat particularly annoying younger\nrelative once and for all why there is\n(probably) no Santa.\nFirst o\ufb00, you need to go out and buy\nthat perfect Christmas tree. It is environmentally better in the long term to\nbuy a real tree, as fake ones are made\nprimarily out of polyvinyl chloride,\nnon-renewable and a producer of carcinogens when synthesised. They may\nalso contain lead and other additives\nthat could lead to health impediments.\nReal trees can look worn and lose their\nneedles very quickly, but studies show\nthat if you maintain your living room\nat around a 90% humidity level, there is\na \ufb01vefold increase in needle retention,\nas this reduces water loss and any xylem tension that causes the needles to\ndrop o\ufb00. You might want to give your\nChristmas party a tropical theme this\nyear\u2026\nStill not a tree fan? Mistletoe may be\nthe hemi-parasitic evergreen for you.\nViscum fraxini, an aqueous extract\nfrom mistletoe species Viscum album\nL., may have medical potential.

With the average number\nof children per household being 1.8,\nand assuming in this waste-conscious\ntime we only leave one mince pie per\nhousehold, that is still 5,689,148 mince\npies Santa needs to get through.

Reindeer instead have\nfour limbs developed into large circular hooves used to scrape snow from\nlichen and to spread out their weight,\nwhich are hardly aerodynamic. Also,\non average, they weigh around 350kg\nand do not feature hollow bones, or a\nrespiratory system based around four\nair sacs (as seen in birds) that acts a lot\nlike bellows. Reindeer are destined to\nstay on the ground.\nOn a cheerier note, there is always\nthe potential for theoretical physicists\nto \ufb01ll in the gaps, with wormholes or\nspace-time warping having the potential for Santa to deliver all the presents\nin the allotted amount of time. Something some of you could consider for\nPh.D research?

It was most apparent to me when\nI attended a wedding recently in which\nthe groom was unable to lead his wife\nin a slow waltz. We seem to be approaching a situation in which the tra-ditional, re\ufb01ned and tasteful style of\nimpressing the punters with a quirky\nQuickstep, winning their hearts with\nan impassioned Argentine Tango, or\nsetting the \ufb02oor on \ufb01re with an energis-ing Jive, have long been forgotten in the\nrealm of the younger generations. Instead, many such functions these days\nare more oriented towards entertaining\na rowdy bunch of party-seekers after a\nrave and a whiskey rather than a whisk\nand chass\u00e9. Have we just become lazy?\nIn times past, ballroom dancing was\nsocial dancing for the privileged; the\nlower classes were left with folk danc-ing. The modern waltz is derived from\nthe Renaissance dance the Volta; it arrived in England in around 1812, and\nwas met with great opposition due\nto the impropriety of the closed hold.\nIn the early 20th Century there was a\nmovement towards dances where couples moved independently, and many\nnewly invented dances arose with the\ngrowing popularity of Jazz. Many of the\nwell-known Latin dances originated in\nAfrican and Central American regions\nbut in 1910, a diverse assemblage of\nprofessional ballet teachers and musicians came together and standardised\nthe curriculum used today. In modern\ncompetitions dancers are assessed on\npoise, frame and posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, \ufb02oor craft, foot and\nleg action, and presentation. It is the\nproduct of dedication and a great deal\nof sometimes \u2013 in fact, often \u2013 painful training and conditioning. But it is\nsurely worthwhile for the impression,\nthe glamour, excitement and unpre-dictability. Ballroom, Latin and social\ndancing are a beautiful spectacle, but in\nmodern times they seem not to enjoy\nthe same popularity and appreciation\nthey used to be met with in the younger\ngenerations. Despite this, in the UK\nthere are currently around 30,000 people regularly competing at local, national or international level, from amateur to professional, of which around\n14,000 of these are in the university\ncircle. Of course, these \ufb01gures have\ngreatly proliferated since around 2004\nwith the advent of Strictly Come Dancing. Competition between universities\nhas been manifest in the UK for over\n40 years. In the 1960\u2019s, a dance teacher\nfrom the society at the University of\nManchester thought it would be better if his students were able to compete\nagainst those from other universities, in\nthe knowledge that many other universities in the UK also had teams. In this\nway, the modern inter-university competition was formed as it exists today,\nand is still gaining momentum, as one\nof the most successful and recognised\ncompetition series in any discipline undertaken by university students.\nThe ICU Dance Society is historically\nthe largest and one of the most prestigious and well-endowed societies at\nImperial, currently with over 200 members competing regularly or just dancing for leisure. It is also one of the most\nactive. Those new to Ballroom and\nLatin dancing can join the beginners\u2019\nteam, which enters \ufb01ve competitions\nthroughout the year, including three\nregional events, and the Southern University and Inter-Varsity Dance Competitions (SUDA and IVDA), the latter taking place at the magni\ufb01cent and\nprestigious Blackpool Winter Gardens\nBallroom, an internationally renowned\nvenue which has held everything from\npolitical conferences to pop concerts.\nICU Dance has a reputation for producing top quality dancers, many of\nwhom go on to dance professionally,\nand coach new, up-coming talent. One\nsuch example is Arman Sahovic, who\nwith his partner Maria Naumchenko\nwon the national championships in\nballroom twice and in Latin once, and\nranked in the top 100 according to the\nBlackpool rankings (the most famous\nin the world). The outstanding level of\ntalent, performance and activity within\nICU Dance also attracts the very best in\nexternal professional coaching, with internationally reputed teachers such as\nElena Plescenco, who was eight times\nPortuguese National champion, and is\ncurrently ranked in the top 48 in Latin,\nand Snow Draper, who reached the\nsemi-\ufb01nal of the Blackpool championships in ballroom and was ranked in\nthe top 10 in the world. With this level\nof instruction and coaching, it is unsurprising that this year\u2019s team captain\nwon every competition she entered at\nintermediate level in the 2011-12 sea-son, and this year is competing in the\nEx-Student advanced level category;\nor that a former Imperial beginners\u2019\ncouple, Natasha and Stefano reached\nthe top 24 in the Blackpool ballroom\nrankings; or indeed that historically\nthe Imperial beginners team has been\nthe most successful at the competitions since the 1990\u2019s, with three couples qualifying for the Latin \ufb01nal and\ntwo for the ballroom \ufb01nal at this year\u2019s\nNottingham Varsity Ball competition\non 24th November. On average a beginners\u2019 team couple from Imperial\nwill win at least three of the \ufb01ve competitions entered every three years.\nContinued success is promoted beyond university as well, with the Imperial College Dance Alumni Association\n(ICDAA).\nDance Society is not only about Ballroom and Latin however. Dancers are\ncoached in social dancers such as Salsa,\nSwing and Argentine Tango, regularly\nperform in major showcases including Mega Maalai and East Meets West,\nand even participate in classic external\nevents such as C\u00e9ilidh at Burns Night.\nLaith,theSalsainstructor,wastwicethe\nBritish National Salsa champion in the\nperiod 2004-06. There are also enchanting socials including the Winter Ball\nand Spring Ball in which there are live\nbands and top professional performer\ndemonstrations. The annual \u201cImperial\nCome Dancing\u201d competition is hosted\n\u2013 in which professors and senior Union\nsta\ufb00 from across Imperial team up with\ncouples from the ICU Dance team, and\nare taught how to dance, and a host of\nother mind-blowingly glamorous black\ntie events all accompanied by dedicated\nsemi-professional photographers to\ncapture those key moments, take place\nthroughout the calendar.\nAs a university team, overall Imperial\naverages around third in the national\ncompetitions, only to Oxford and\nCambridge. No other institution comes\nclose; but is it not time to prove to Oxbridge that we are better than they?\nSo, instead of just watching a bunch of\nblundering inelegant thrill-seekers on\nStrictly and pretending to be impressed\nbecause your parents are watching,\nisn\u2019t it time to dust of the shiny black\nshoes, fasten the cu\ufb04inks and blitz that\ndance \ufb02oor?\nAlex Mason Sports Writer\nWatch out goatee man!

Of course, Felix was\ninvited. Set along Stokes Croft - which\ncould be deemed a mini \u2018Hoxditch\u2019 of\nBristol - bars, caf\u00e9s, and cinemas showcased exciting up-and-coming artists.\nDZ Deathrays,\nMotorcycle Showrooms\nNo, I don\u2019t know what DZ stands for,\nand frankly I don\u2019t really care. Watching the music video to The Mess Up\nin which the two members consume a\nbottle of Jeigermeister in three minutes,\nwas enough to persuade me to go and\ncatch them. Although not the biggest\nfan of any kind of remotely guitar-heavy\nmusic, the Deathrays\u2019 set was surprisingly very enjoyable. Full of energy,\nnoise, sweat and crowdsur\ufb01ng, it was a\nfuncontrasttothepreviousbands\u2019more\nconserved playlists. What was really enjoyable was that their aural tantrum was\nre\ufb01ned by a melodious, charming angle;\nand the singer stood in the middle of the\ndance\ufb02oor for a whole track (plenty of\ntime for unavoidable touching).\nOliver Wilde,\nthe Cube Cinema\nHidden amongst a housing es-tate, the Cube Cinema was a cute\nlittle venue well-suited to the cute\nlittle sounds of Oliver Wilde. A\ngroovy (hate to use that word, but\nit was actually groovy) bass accompanied a drummer with a Darwin\nDeez-like Movember, violin player,\nand soft distorted vocals to recreate what music would sound like if\nit had been channelled through an\naural Instagram app before being channelled through your ears. Their softened\nDIIV in The Garage\nZachary Cole Smith is the guitarist for\nlo-\ufb01 surf rock out\ufb01t Beach Fossils,\nwhose band-members are currently o\ufb00\npursuing their own side-projects. For\nSmith, his e\ufb00orts have coalesced into\nDIIV (said \u2018Dive\u2019), with the debut album Oshin coming out earlier this year.\nFrom these names, you get no points\nfor guessing that DIIV\u2019s music is still\nvery much awash with that seaside\nsound, but the album also includes\nsome more sophisticated guitar playing and elements of shoegaze and\npsychedelia. Described as \u201cone part\nTHC, two parts MDMA\u201d, Oshin was a\ngorgeous, dreamy debut record, a de\ufb01nite soundtrack to my summer.\nConversely, they decided to bring the\ntour to the UK as winter began to sink\nin around us, playing a smattering of\nheadline dates and providing support\nto the (vastly inferior) Vaccines. This\nquick dash around the country included one brief stop in London, a sell-out\nheadline date at the Relentless Garage\nin Islington.\nSupport came in the form of Aldous R.H, in fact another side-project\nfronted by Manchester native Alex\nHewitt of Egyptian Hip Hop fame.\nA heady mix of psychedelic guitars\nand delay-soaked vocals, their sound\nswung from sounding like Tame Impala slowed down to getting lost in\na droney cover of an Arthur Russell\nsong that left the crowd somewhat\ndisorientated. Though I\u2019d been tipped\nabout them before, their set was pleasantly surprising; it says a lot that they\nmanaged to pull quite a crowd away\nfrom the bars. Sadly, the same couldn\u2019t\nbe said about the other support band\nPadraic Calpin Writer\nDZ Deathrays\nBritpop sound was a sweet\nway to start o\ufb00 the festival,\nbut the repeated camera roll\nof a girl prancing up and\ndown a green hill behind\nthem got annoyingly laborious after a few songs.\nLabyrinth Ear,\nLakota\nLabyrinth Ear was the\nmain attraction that drew us to the\nfestival. Although they played in one\nof those annoying venues where it\u2019s so\ncold that you have to keep your coat on\nand it\u2019s too uncomfortable to drink anything except hot chocolate, this didn\u2019t at\nall ruin the experience of watching this\ninteresting new two-piece. Kicking o\ufb00\nwith their most, understatedly, erotic\nLabyrinth Ear\ntrack and personal favourite \u2018Amber\u2019\nwas enough to turn a \ufb01ve person audience into a three-quarters full dance\n\ufb02oor. Not even the extreme shyness\nof the endearing el\ufb01n-like singer who\nseemed to refuse to look at anything except the \ufb02oor or her fellow band member could disturb the crowd\u2019s level of\nengagement. It is a shame that they have\ncome onto the scene amongst a burst of\nmale/female electronic acts of the mo-ment, being overshadowed by artists\nsuch as Crystal Castles, the XX, and\nPurity Ring; it is understandable why\nthey may be dismissed and tossed onto\nParakeet, who\n\ufb01t with the\nslow-burning\ngrunge/garage-rock revival\nthat I can\u2019t really get into.\nBut if Aldous seemed\nto have drawn\na good crowd,\nit was nothing compared\nto the turn-out\nfor DIIV them-selves; the venue was packed\nthe pile. However, even if the aesthetics\nof their sound are not obviously unique,\nthe e\ufb00ect of their music is underrated\nand yet unparalleled by such acts as the\nabove; demonstrated by their closing\npiece \u2018Humble Bones\u2019\n, which somehow\nmanages to recreate that excited but\nintimidating feeling which drowns you\naround the people you fancy in a non-cheesy dance \ufb02oor track.\nTOY,\nMotorcycle Showrooms\nTOY was de\ufb01nitely the least impressive band of all the ones we\nmanaged to catch at the festival. In\nthis case their aural tantrum was not re\ufb01ned by\nanything except a very\nwhiney and painful keyboard which seemed to\nbe played by bashing the keys\nand then holding the chords\nfor minutes on end. Whatever the singer was trying to\nget out of his mouth was not\naudible, and their lack of audience engagement was not\nat all endearing as was the\ncase for Labyrinth Ear. Their\njust-yanked-out of the seventies look\nwas not going for them. The whole thing\nwas a shambles. Nevertheless, there was\nsomething charming about their set:\nprobably the knowledge that their studio recordings are decent but were just\nplayed in a very poor way. Many bands\nare the same, and many artists need to\nlearn that playing unenthusiastically\ndoes not equate to being cool. They are\na band that have potential, and whom\nI would see again in the hope that they\nwould get their act together and actually\nplay well.\nFear of Fiction festival is a new festival held in Bristol highlighting the best\nin new, undiscovered music. Organised\nby the labels, magazines and shops that\nmake the Bristol music scene tick, there\u2019s\nno better way into the local scene.\nalmost wall to wall and quickly became\nuncomfortably hot, and this wasn\u2019t\nhelped by what happened once the\nband got on stage. After beginning with\nthe soothing melodies of album opener \u2018Druun\u2019, Smith and his bandmates\nsuddenly launched into the next track\n\u2018Past Lives\u2019 in double time, thrashing\nout the ri\ufb00s in a way that was impressive but utterly unexpected. The front\nof the crowd went mad, but I was left\nbemused.\nAnd they continued in this way for\nthe rest of the show, playing every\nsong at twice the tempo and throwing in solos and jams that warped the\naesthetic completely. The tracks were\nfamiliar, and every now and then an\noasis of calm seemed to form as a familiar melody took hold, only to be\ninterrupted but an inexplicable \ufb02urry\nof notes. It was all frantic, more dude\nrock than shoegaze. Escaping to the\nback of the room for fear of melting\nand looking around at the crowd, it\nseemed I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d\nbe caught o\ufb00-guard; DIIV were technically brilliant, no doubt, but this\nwasn\u2019t what I\u2019d expected to see.\nNothing says \u2018culture\u2019 like graffiti and decay\nStereotype indie\n\n"

As the tourists arrived and the \ufb01rst beers of the\nweekend were consumed there was\none notable absentee: an extremely\nlate drop out by Dale, citing commitments to his biological studies, left the\ncongregation delighted. The pengest\nof tour shirts were distributed and the\nmost entertaining of journeys began.\nIt is rare that the two worlds of public transport and ICUAFC\u2019s \ufb01rst sport\ncollide but when they do carnage is\ncertain to ensue: Train Box was met\nwith bewilderment by commuters,\nawkward smiles by young mothers and\ndelight by the present airborne rang-ers. A bout of silent box and a lullaby\nof Bohemian Rhapsody, led by Watkin\u2019s soothing tones, sent the baby to\nsleep whilst an origami swan was presented meaning public relations were\nmaintained and Rochester will never\nagain pass a CRB check. By our arrival\nin Brighton whistles had been whetted and mini tour had well and truly\nbegan. The bus to the hostel involved\na rousing rendition of airborne ranger\nwhilst a failed Klinsmann attempt by\nStillwell left onlookers wincing.\nOur \ufb01rst night in the beautiful city\nbegan with matchbox pairs leading to\nwidespread animosity between fresh-ers and old boys. An exception to this\nwas the pairing of Murphy and Watkin\nwho struck up a certain romance (in\nthe library). Pints of the dirtiest variety were consumed. Murphy, thinking this punishment was not enough,\ndecided to provide his own natural\npunishment (in the Library). The disappearance of this pint remains one of\nthe many weekend\u2019s mysteries. Then,\ndancing shoes were donned and the\ngroup headed out to one of Brighton\u2019s\npremier venues where highlights included knee slides and Wright\u2019s frank\nconfessions to a member of the opposite sex. Bennett and Dabbagh decided\nit was their lucky night and headed out\ninto the night to win big. The casino\u2019s\nsecurity guards had other ideas. After a civilised exchange of views, one\nparticularly frustrated bouncer took it\nupon himself to violently throw Dabbagh from the roof of the tallest building in Brighton (although on further\ninspection of the sight of the crime\nit became clear that the fall had been\nwildly exaggerated). The absence of\nSchon at the hostel set minds racing about the potential for providing\nshoulders to cry on leading to his reappearance being greeted with mixed\nemotions.\nThe Saturday of the weekend saw\nICUAFC\u2019s big game against Brighton\nand Hove Medical School. Peacock\ngave room 15 a treat and they were\nscarred by the view. From the afternoon\u2019s forced pints the group headed\nto the game. Thanks to Bennett\u2019s exceptional knowledge of his hometown\nand ability to fend o\ufb00 multiple questions with ease we arrived at the venue\npromptly and with Bennett\u2019s house\nstill unfound. 36 man headers and Volleys, a patented Smithy warm-up and\nshouts of \u201cTK Maxx\u201d left the squad\nraring to go. The game started as a cagey a\ufb00air with Beasley\u2019s work rate being\nquestioned and Bizzell failing to hit\nany barn doors with his trusty banjo.\nThe game changed with the introduction of Cann. Refusing to rest on past\ntour successes Cann brought a breath\nof fresh air to proceedings and he undoubtedly had some involvement in\nICs \ufb01rst goal which Maizonnier \ufb01nished with aplomb after a swift breakaway and through ball from Murphy (from the Library). Cue delight\namongst the 25 subs/backroom sta\ufb00/\nfans. Stillwell\u2019s introduction only tightened Cann\u2019s grip on the game and IC\nreached half time with a comfortable\n1-0 lead. Wholesale changes at halftime led to IC losing their \ufb02ow slightly\ndespite Stillwell\u2019s tireless e\ufb00orts and\nwell-timed challenges in mid\ufb01eld. As\nthe pressure on the IC goal mounted\nthe medics made it count as their\nstriker evaded the attentions of Wright\nand \ufb01red his shot through the legs of\nthe otherwise outstanding Mason in\ngoal. The disgust of Bennett as he left\nthe pitch epitomised the frustration of\nthe team. Cue another round of substitutions from Milo \u201cthe tinker man\u201d\nMcGrath. The second coming of Murphy (to the Library) swung the game\nback into ICs favour and, with a relatively small amount of time remaining,\nIC made the decisive breakthrough.\nButt played a trademark outside of the\nfoot pass wide to Maizonnier whose\ndeep cross from the right was met at\nthe back post by a marauding Jarvis\nwho volleyed home impeccably. Celebrations resembling a game of FIFA\n(other football simulators are available (but are shit)) left no doubt over\nwhich team had put the most preparation into the game. The \ufb01nal whistle\nsounded and IC were victorious. Man\nof the match was awarded to Mason\nfor his tireless standing and saving\nwhilst McGrath\u2019s insightful tactics,\nmost notably the pioneering 3-3-1-3\nformation, were deservedly praised.\nHowever, as we headed out Mason\u2019s mind must still have been on his\n\ufb01ne performance as his box play was\natrocious much to Bennett\u2019s disgust.\nMeanwhile, Murphy and Watkin exchanged wedding vows over Jaeger\nbombs (in the Library), the captain\nplayer relationship between Stillwell\nand Lawson completely broke down\nwith a moist outcome and Wright\nreacted violently to all the fun (fortu-nately medical professionals were on\nhand). ICUAFC showed their creative\nside by producing a work of art. Notable contributors included Maizonnier, Murphy and Butt who eloquently\nnamed their creation \u201ccubicle three\u201d.\nSearle was determined to make the\nmost of the night, after some crafty\nwatch work allowed him free entry,\nand set about repelling the female\npopulation of Brighton with a manoeuvre that become known as \u201cThe\ncrab\u201d. Tensions between two of the\nparty\u2019s ethnic minorities rose leading\nto an exchange of bodily \ufb02uids whilst\nAdelowo had a night to forget ending up being assaulted by his own bed\nafter making some bold and slightly\ndisturbing claims. As eyes became\nbleary and thoughts turned to bed a\nlate night breakfast wade was clearly\nin order. Whilst Dabbagh marvelled\nat the burger and chips sneaked onto\nhis plate, Ogunbiyi\u2019s love of Chicken\ndrew the attentions of the door sta\ufb00.\nFortunately, before the riot van was\ncalled, the bouncer settled the argument by sharing Ogunbiyi\u2019s love of the\nmeat and silencing Cann. Meanwhile,\nMurphy had decided the hostel was\ntoo far away and sought alternative accommodation with a sea view (in the\nLibrary) and Stillwell and McGrath attempted to fake the death of Watkin.\nFriends and family of Watkin were said\nto be convinced by a text stating \u201cI am\ndead\u201d much to Watkin\u2019s amusement. A\nlate night episode of George Bizzell\u2019s\nstory time was the perfect end to an\neventful evening.\nOn Sunday morning the airborne\nrangers were woken by shouts of\n\u201ccome in, it\u2019s open!\u201d and the Sun\nstreaming in through the windows\nof the hostel whilst a heated debate\nover the age old question of sitting or\nstanding erupted in room 105. There\nwas just time for a stroll along the seafront and a trip to Brighton\u2019s famous\npier where plastic horses amused for\nhours, Dabbagh was successful on the\nteddy picker and Lambe and Bennett\nduelled on an air hockey table: it was\na cagey a\ufb00air with neither player really\ndominating the early stages with the\nturning point being an extraordinary\ntriple wall bounce goal to which Bennett had no reply. Before we knew it\nwe had left the sea air behind us and\nreturned to London with new Facebook friends, relationships in tatters\nand some sights we may never be able\nto forget.\nIC Football get hot and sweaty in Brighton\nSpencer Bennett Tour Secretary\nIf football had given us a higher res pic we\ncould\u2019ve zoomed in.

His\nextremely volatile nature is a\ntour-de-force of a performance,\none that grabs your attention\nfrom the get-go and holds on\ndespite the difficult turns and\ndevelopments Anderson often\npresents.\nBest Actress:\nMarion Cotillard\nRust and Bone\nAs a killer-whale trainer who\ngoes through a horri\ufb01c accident,\nCotillard\u2019s nuanced, carefully\nmeasured performance is a thing\nof wonder as she \ufb01ercely dives\ninto the complex persona of a\ndouble leg amputee faced with\nthe many challenges of everyday\nlife.

With his thick Southern\naccent, sly slinky moves, cheeky\ncon\ufb01dence and sly grin to top it\nall off, he is the comic highlight of\nthe \ufb01lm, whilst also wisely never\nunderplaying the \u201cantagonist\u201d\naspect of his outstanding role that\nsimply outclasses his many other\nco-stars.\nBest Supporting Actress:\nHelena Bonham Carter\nGreat Expectations\nIn a role that seems to have\nbeen written speci\ufb01cally for\nthis English actress even before\nshe was born, Carter excels in\noccupying the role of one of\nliterature\u2019s most famous jilted\nbrides, Miss Havisham. Adding\nenough kooky craziness in her\ncreepy wedding dress whilst also\nrevealing a subtle touch of stirring\nhumanity, she is the most fun, but\nalso tragic part of an otherwise\ndull and dry \ufb01lm.\nBest Director:\nGary Ross\nThe Hunger Games\nTurning a popular franchise of\nnovelsaimedatteenagers,making\nit as potent and meaningful to the\nadults is a difficult task, but Ross\nwascertainlyupforthechallenge.\nWith his intimate, up-close, shaky\ncamerawork injecting plenty of\nrealism and suspense into the\nfuturistic thriller, it\u2019s no wonder\nthis became such an unexpected\nhit with a wide demographic.\nShame he\u2019s not involved in the\nmany sequels to come.\nRising Star of the Year:\nJeremy Irvine\nHe was hand-picked by Steven\nSpielberg to take part in his\nWorld War I epic War Horse\nand his success didn\u2019t end there:\nwith lead starring roles in Now\nis Good, and Great Expectations,\nthis young English talent appears\nto stand a good chance in making\nit big in this tough business, with\nSpielberg calling him the new\nChristian Bale. Up next is The\nRailway Children, where he will\nstand alongside Oscar winners\nColin Firth and Nicole Kidman.\nEnsemble of the Year:\nThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\nJudi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup (and Dev\nPatel... sure, he can get in on this list) \u2013 a cast list doesn\u2019t read better than this. And despite the choppy direction\nand unsure narrative that prevented this from becoming a mediocre crowd-pleaser, the English legends help sell\nthe story.

What started this off\nwas her unforgettable debut\nperformance in the brilliantly\nambiguous Martha Marcy\nMay Marlene and she has since\nfollowed that up with equally\nmemorable supporting turns\nin Silent House, Red Lights, and\nLiberal Arts.

The nominations; particularly for \u2018Most Improved Student\nExperience\u2019 ought to be good news\nfor Imperial that has lagged behind\nother universities in student satisfaction ratings which has contributed to\ndisappointing Guardian Rankings in\nrecent years. (It came in 13th in the\n2013 rankings behind the University\nof Bath, The University of Essex and\nperhaps most disturbingly, UCL).\nThe awards that aim to \u201crecognize\nexcellence and reward extraordinary\ninnovation, talent and imagination of\nUK higher education\u201d were initiated\nin 2007. Judging was carried out \u201cby\na distinguished panel of experts\u201d that\nincluded Sir Deian Hopkin, President\nof the National Library of Wales and\nLiam Burns, President of the National Union of Students. UniversiKanchanca Niruttan Reporter\nLast month Imperial saw the return\nof Charity Week, an annual campaign\norganised by the Islamic Society with\nthe aim of raising as much money as\npossible for orphans and needy children worldwide. This year the Week\nwas held between 29 November and\n4 December, however some events\nwere held outside of this week due to\nroom booking constraints. Months\nof preparation and behind the scenes\nwork culminated in a series of exciting and innovative events, including\nthe now much renowned \u2018Battle of\nthe Societies\u2019 quiz night, which saw\nover 20 societies \ufb01ght it out to win\nthe coveted trophy and all the glory\nthat comes along with it (won by\nthe Tamil Society), as well as street\nand tube collections all over West\nLondon which over 100 students\ntook part in. The Week reached its\nclimax with the prestigious Charity\nWeek Annual Dinner, this year held\nin Hammersmith Town Hall, which\nwas attended by over 250 Imperial\nstudents and sta\ufb00, including Paul\nBeaumont, Union President, and\nDeputy President Henry Whittaker,\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies). A massive \u00a318,000 was raised\non the night, partly down to the exciting auction (which saw a chocolate cake go for \u00a31,250), but also due\nto the generosity of 21 individuals\nwho each sponsored an orphan for a\nyear\u2019s duration.\nCharity Week is a national campaign facilitated by one of the UK\u2019s\nleading charities \u2013 Islamic Relief \u2013\none of 14 charities that make up the\nUK\u2019s Disaster Emergency Committee. For this speci\ufb01c campaign, they\noperate under a 100% donation poli-cy, meaning that every penny raised\nby students will go towards helping\norphans and needy children worldwide (the exact destinations will\nbe voted on shortly), without there\nbeing any admin costs. As stated\nin their mission statement, they allocate resources regardless of race,\npolitical a\ufb03liation, gender or belief,\nand without expecting anything in\nreturn.\nAll in all, Imperial College students\nmanaged to raise \u00a346,939, coming third after UCL and Kings (who\nraised \u00a350,748 and \u00a350,369 respec-tively), but considering that Imperial has nearly half the number of\nstudents that either institution has,\nthis was a tremendous e\ufb00ort by all\nthose who participated and donated,\nand the Islamic Society said that they\nwould like to thank everyone who\ntook part.\nties that do not traditionally top the\nLeague Tables have dominated the\nAwards; it indicates perhaps a degree\nof complacency among the \u2018more\nprestigious\u2019 institutions.

Keep stirring so it doesn\u2019t\nburn at the bottom, though.\n* Why not make this recipe your own\nby adding a little extra something?\nYou could dice a red chilli or 2 slices of\nbacon, fry until crispy and add on top.\n10 mins if you cut your spuds up into\ngolfball-sized pieces.\nWhen you\u2019re done, drain, cover the\npan, and shake them around a bit to\n\ufb02u\ufb00 up the exterior. Then coat in oil/\nfat of your choice; some toss them together in the roasting tin that contains\nthe meat halfway through the roasting\ntime, coating it in the oil that\u2019s drained\no\ufb00 during the process. Cooking them\nboth in the same tin does save you on\nthe washing up!\nSpuds may be well and all, but how\nabout other veggies? Mother certainly\nwould balk at the thought of you not\ngetting your 5 a day, even if it is the festive season! Parsnips, carrots, squash,\nleek and the like roast beautifully (es-sentially, most root veg) \u2013 just make\nsure you lightly oil and season before\nyou pop them into the oven.\nRoasting isn\u2019t the only way to do\nthem, though; boiling/steaming some\nbroccoli, peas, corn etc. is perfectly acceptable if the rest of the meal is very\nrich and dense. Just be sure to not keep\n1 1\u20444 cups flour\n3\u20444 teaspoon baking powder\n1\u20442 teaspoon baking soda\nPinch of salt\n1/3 cup oil\n3\u20444 cup sugar\n1/4 teaspoon almond extract\n1\u20442 teaspoon strong vanilla extract\n1 cup milk (preferably almond)\n1 teaspoon white wine vinegar\nFlaked almonds\n1\u20444 cup chopped walnuts or\nhazelnuts\nFor the ganache:\n1\u20444 cup milk (soy for vegans)\n120 grams dark chocolate\nMakes 12\nPreheat the oven at 180\u00b0C.

(Vegan friendly)\nand set aside for a few minutes. Then\nadd the oil, sugar and extracts and stir.\nIn a bowl mix all the dry ingredients\nand then add the wet ingredients. Stir\nuntil the flour is just dissolved but be\ncareful not to overmix. Fold in the al-monds. Place the batter in the cupcake\ncases so that 2/3 of each case is full.\nBake in the oven for about 20 minutes or until they are golden brown.\nTo make the ganache boil the milk\nand then add the chocolate. Stir until\nall the chocolate has melted. Using a\nspatula cover the cupcakes with the\nganache and then add some chopped\nwalnuts on top for decoration.\nWahey, you\u2019re at the home stretch\nnow! Our good ol\u2019 mate (read: British tradition) advocates fruity treats\nlike dense Christmas fruitcake,\nmince pies, and the misleadingly-named Christmas plum pudding \u2013\nyes, misleading because the Victorians thought it would be clever to\nuse plums to refer to raisins back in\nJust Desserts\nCarol\u2019s Cheerful Mulled Wine\nFeel free to serve any tipple or beverage of choice during your meal \u2013 but if you\u2019re\nafter Christmas in a glass, mulled wine comes up tops along with eggnog.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Lordable conversation\nAlex Morton interviews constitutional expert Lord Norton\nabout constitutional reform\nAlex Morton: Thank you very much\nfor giving up your time this afternoon Lord Norton. Could you briefly explain the principal functions of\nthe House of Lords, and why it mat-ters?\nLord Norton: It matters because it is\nthe second chamber, and because it is\nnot elected it is complimentary to the\n\ufb01rst chamber, and that is what gives it\nits value as it\u2019s neither duplicating nor\nchallenging the elected \ufb01rst chamber.\nIt adds value by pursuing tasks that the\n\ufb01rst chamber doesn\u2019t have the time,\nthe political will, or it may not have\nthe resources. Its principal tasks are\nlegislative scrutiny, di\ufb00erent from the\nCommons, which focuses particularly\non the principle \u2013 so if you like, the\nends of legislation \u2013 we don\u2019t seek to\nchallenge that as the unelected cham-ber. So we focus on the means and\ntherefore devote our time to looking\nat the detail, trying to improve legisla-tion. This can be time consuming and\ncan be very demanding and the sort of\nthing we can do because of the nature\nof our membership and because we\ndon\u2019t need to do things, which if you\nlike, are high pro\ufb01le \u2013 [we don\u2019t] get\npolitical attention the way that MPs\ndo. That is why we compliment the\nCommons and the nature of our membership allows us to do it, because we\nare a House of experience and exper-tise, which can therefore examine legislation in a way the elected politicians\nmay not have the time or the will so\nto do.\nLegislative scrutiny is our main ac-tivity, it takes \ufb01fty to sixty per cent\nof our time in the chamber, and then\nexecutive scrutiny, or scrutiny of public policy. Not just [UK] Government\npolicy, but European policy as well,\nthat is one of our strengths. And again,\nwe seek to compliment the work of the\nCommons, we don\u2019t duplicate, we\u2019re\nincreasingly specialised through the\nuse of committees, but whereas the\nCommons has got departmental select\ncommittees, Home A\ufb00airs, Foreign\nA\ufb00airs, and so on, we go for cross cutting committees that transcend di\ufb00erent departments. So we add value by\nlooking at areas that are not covered\nusually by the Commons, and again\ncomplementarity, for example, in\nscrutiny of European Union propos-als. The Commons has the European\nUnion scrutiny committee, but that\nchecks every document, if you like it\ngoes for breadth, against particular\nchanges. We go for depth with our EU\ncommittee, just selecting those proposals which are politically or legally\nsigni\ufb01cant, adopt to one of the subcommittees and therefore examined it\nin detail. So there is great liaison between the two committees, we complement one another, and it makes us\none of the more e\ufb00ective Parliaments\nwithin the EU with scrutiny of the EU\nproposals.\nOur third function is essentially\ndebate, not just debating legislation,\nbut debating issues, many of which\ncome outside the context of the normal party debate and issues that can\na\ufb00ect people or sections or particular\ngroups in society, which may not be\nthat popular, but nonetheless have a\ncase that deserves at least to be heard.\nAnd we\u2019ve got as a subset of that debate function, an agenda setting role.\nSo sometimes we will be able to bring\non to the agenda a subject that\u2019s not\nbeen considered before or hasn\u2019t been\nconsidered for quite a considerable\nperiod of time \u2013 make sure it\u2019s heard,\nbut not for resolution or legislation,\nbut to get the ball rolling on the agen-da. Good recent example: assisted dy-ing. Controversial, deserves to have an\nairing, some MPs a bit wary, contro-versial, keep an eye on their constitu-ents. We raise it, get the ball rolling.\nAM: Considering your unelected\nnature, how can the public actively\nengage with you if are not accountable at the ballot box?\nLN: They can engage with us quite easily in the same way they can with MPs,\nin a sense, insofar as we\u2019re account-able, it\u2019s more collectively through\nthe Commons because ultimately the\nCommons can get its way. If you like,\nmore generally, more basically, we are\nfairly transparent and people can see\nwhat we are doing, and we do welcome input. So we try to exploit all\nthe opportunities we can to encourage\npeople to make clear their views when\ncommittees are considering matters,\nor indeed when legislation is going\nthrough. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a bill, which has\nbeen sent to a Joint Committee, the\nLords members will be e\ufb00ective as\nthe Commons members in soliciting\nviews of interested parties. We do get\nlots of representation from individuals\nand from groups on an ever increasing scale. People are aware of what\nwe are doing, and we welcome it, and\nwe can engage with it because we\u2019ve\ngot members who can understand the\nsubject and therefore can engage with\npeople outside who are also informed\nabout it. We can have a proper dialogue as a prelude to our scrutiny of\nlegislation, and indeed of raising other\nissues.\nAlso, we try to be fairly proactive.\nFor example through the \u201cPeers in\nSchools\u201d programme, we are going\ninto schools to explain what we\u2019re do-ing, and so far we\u2019ve reached about\n\ufb01fty thousand. And of course we are\nreaching teachers who can then continue disseminating the information.\nSo we are trying to engage with peo-ple. We are now trying to reach out\nmore generally at the University level,\nso that people who weren\u2019t aware of\nwhat we\u2019re doing are now more aware\n[of both what we are doing] and the\nfact that they can have some engage-ment. We\u2019re as keen to hear from\nthem as anyone else, in terms of making their views known to all.\nAM: Earlier this year you were a\nmember of the Joint Committee\nappointed to conduct pre-legisla-tive scrutiny on the Draft House of\nLords Reform Bill. As well as sitting\non the committee, you were a signatory to the Alternative Report that\nwas published. What prompted you\nand eleven other members to produce this report?\nLN: A number of reasons, mainly the\nde\ufb01ciencies with what the Government had brought forward in terms of\ntheir Draft Bill. We were limited, we\nhad to deal with the bill before us, so\nit wasn\u2019t a case of looking at the issue\nfrom \ufb01rst principles, reform [by] electing the second chamber was taken as\na given, and that\u2019s never really been\naddressed in terms of \u201cWhy?\u201d. We had\nto deal with the detail of the bill. The\ndetail of the bill itself was fairly\u2026 de\ufb01cient\u2026 for all sorts of reasons. It\u2019s a bad\nbill, lots of problems with it, including\nthe attempt to try and ensure the primacy of the House of Commons, in\nrelation to the Lords. The way they try\nto do that through Clause 2 was inad-equate, and that wasn\u2019t just the view\nof those who signed the Alternative\nReport, it was the view of the whole\ncommittee. It was fairly unanimous.\nThat was a particularly serious prob-lem. There are others as well. So the\nreport was \ufb02awed, our Joint Committee report drew attention to that, but\nthe alternative report went further because we actually questioned the need\nfor electing the second chamber and\nfelt the need to stand back and look at\nthe role of the House of Lords as part\nof Parliament and what they expect\nof Parliament in our political system.\nMy argument is that the bill looks at it\nfrom the wrong end of the telescope.\nIt\u2019s dealing with composition without\naddressing form, and you need to start\nwith what we expect the institution to\ndo, then you create the people to carry\nout the speci\ufb01c tasks you expect of it.\nNot the other way round.\nAM: How would you respond to\ncomments, such as those from Lord\nAshdown, that there are only a very\nfew other chambers in the world\nwhich are non-elected? Do we want\nto be, as he puts it, in such company\nas Belarus, Bahrain and Yemen?\nLN: Well, we\u2019re not. As I\u2019ve pointed\nout to him, he\u2019s wrong. In many re-spects, he\u2019s blatantly got his \ufb01gures\nwrong, both in terms of elected second chambers and indeed where they\nare elected, the relationship between\nthem and the \ufb01rst chamber. So, bit\n\ufb02awed. There\u2019s only a minority of second chambers that are wholly elected,\na minority are appointed, and the others are a mixture of them in form of\ncomposition. It varies, so you can\u2019t\ngeneralise particularly, but we can say\nwe are not the only appointed second\nchamber. And even if we were the only\nappointed second chamber, that\u2019s not\nan argument against having an appointed second chamber if you can\ndemonstrate the bene\ufb01ts that derive\nfrom it. To say that there are elected\nsecond chambers elsewhere and they\nwork is not to suggest in any way that\nthey are better than the second chamber we have and the job that it does.\nAM: Given that you are against the\nabolition of the House in its current\nform, what sort of reforms would\nyou like to see introduced to the\nchamber?\nLN: There are quite a lot of changes\nthat can be made, because I\u2019m in favour of reform but against election.\nI want it to be e\ufb00ective but not elec-tive. It\u2019s really strengthening the existing House in what it does, because it\ndoes add value to the political process.\nHowever, an elected chamber arguably\nis value detracting as there is no obvious bene\ufb01t that would derive from it\nin terms of what it would do, because,\nas electors would be voting for the second chamber on exactly the same ba-FRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\n8\nLord Norton, not reading Felix.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMake your 3D TV more useful\nYong Wen Chua checks out LG\u2019s amazing new dual vision 3D TV\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nNokia & Deadmau5\nLast week Nokia teamed up with Deadmau5, yet again, to put on an amazing\nlight-themed event in London to launch their latest flagship phones. On event\nday it had been exactly 365 days since Nokia originally teamed up with the artist for the launch of the Nokia Lumia 800 at Millbank. This Editor went along to\nthe unbelievable display of the world\u2019s most advanced LASER technology and\nbanged on about, mostly, how great the phone was!\nThis time round, for the launch of the Nokia Lumia 820 and 920, Nokia\nclosed off an entire street by London Bridge and the Shard, rigging everything\nfrom rubbish bins to window frames with lights. The result, another incredible\nlight display while Deadmau5 played first on the roof, then cycling past the\ncrowd and playing on a moving stage. This Editor, having his contacts, secured\ntwo of the 50 free public tickets and I can say with full certainty, the event did\nnot disappoint.\nYou can watch the 4 minute highlights here: http://goo.gl/OvlNM\n25\nonsumer electronics\nmanufacturers often like\nto proclaim that their\nproducts boast the highest numbers in a certain\narbitrary unit that often make no\nsense to the consumers, or are simply\nimmaterial. Cameras like to boast that\nthey have the highest amount of pixels\nwhile computers used to tout their \u201cgigahertz\u201d as their selling point. It seems\nthat this phenomena is almost absent\nin the realm of televisions.\nWhen the rush to 1080p HD-TV\nended, television manufacturers\nrushed to implement 3D imaging in\ntheir products, to the chagrin of some\nand the delight of others. It seems like\nyou cannot sell a TV without having\n3D in it nowadays. Whether consumers like 3D on their TV or not is irrelevant \u2013 3D is here to stay. LG has,\nhowever, managed to make the 3D\ncapabilities of their TV more useful\nby leveraging the technology behind\nthe 3D TV itself to allow two images\nto be displayed simultaneously on the\nscreen. Firstly, let\u2019s take a brief look at\nhow 3D works on some of the TVs.\nThe human eye perceives depth in\nour vision through the slightly di\ufb00erent images that our left and right eyes\nreceive. 3D TVs takes advantage of this\nby making use of a technique known\nas stereoscopy to create an illusion of\ndepth. This is why you can \u201csee\u201d images \ufb02oating out or into the screens\nwhen you don those 3D glasses.\nOne of the ways to deliver di\ufb00erent\nimages to each eye is to polarise the\nlight coming out of the screen. A light\nsource will usually emit light in all the\ndirections. A polarised light source\nwill only emit light in a certain plane.\nSome 3D TVs will display two di\ufb00erent images in two di\ufb00erent polarisa-tions, usually at 45 and 135 degrees.\nThe lens on each side of a pair of 3D\nglasses are polarised to only allow\nlight polarised to a certain plane to\ngo through. In this case, each side of\nthe glasses will be able to deliver different images to the right and left eyes\nof the view, allowing the user\u2019s brain\nto be tricked into having a perception\nof depth.\n\u201c\n... a very innovative and\nseemingly\nvery simple\napplication of\nthe 3D... TV\nLG makes use of this same technique to deliver two simultaneous\nimages over one screen. Two di\ufb00erent\npairs of glasses are each attuned to different polarisation. Two users wearing\nthe di\ufb00erent pairs of glasses will thus\nsee di\ufb00erent images. This was demonstrated during the Live Gadget Show\nwhen two players could simultaneously play a racing game that would\nusually be in the form of a split screen.\nIn this case, the image for each player\nwas blown up to take advantage of\nthe whole screen. The LG representative said that this works for all game\nconsoles without needing any special\nform of processing. The user would\njust have to hit a few buttons on the\nTV remote control to tell the TV how\nthe game consoles splits the screen, either vertically or horizontally, and the\nTV will do the rest of the work.\nThis is a very innovative and seemingly very simple application of the\n3D capabilities of the TV. There are,\nhowever, some kinks to be worked out\n\ufb01rst. While I was playing as one of the\nplayers, I could see the silhouette of\nthe images for the other player. It was\nlike there was a \u201cghost\u201d image behind\nthe one I\u2019m seeing. My conjecture is\nthat this was because my head was\nnot properly aligned with the plane of\npolarisation of the image intended for\nme, resulting in this e\ufb00ect. As the image I saw was upsized from an original\nsplit screen image, the graphics appear\nstretched and look lower in quality.\nStill, there is potential in making\nfuller use of the 3D capabilities of the\nTVs beyond just simply displaying 3D\nimages. There could be the possibility\nof working with game console makers\nin the future to deliver higher \ufb01delity\nimages to two di\ufb00erent players rather than using the current \u201chackish\u201d\nmethod of expanding the split screen\nimages. There could even be the possibility of screening two \ufb01lms at once\non the same TV screen.\nIt is exciting to see companies like\nLG \u201cthink out of the box\u201d by making use of technology meant for one\nthing (in this case 3D) in a di\ufb00erent\nfashion (to deliver two images simul-taneously). With the ever competitive\nconsumer electronics market, such inC\nnovative approaches can only be good\nfor the consumers, until the patent\nlawyers start knocking on the doors of\ncourse.\nJason Parmar Technology Editor\nThe dual screen\nModelling\nsome designer\nglasses at the\nGadget Show\n(see page on\nthe left)\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\n7\nFRIDAY 07 DECEMBER\nThe AMP has many aims that are all\nhoped to work together to refurbish\nand refresh the buildings, improve\nthe thermal performance, and (sub-jectively, of course) make them more\naesthetically pleasing. The thermal ef\ufb01ciency increase should cause savings\nthat mean that the building work will\npay for itself\nMore speci\ufb01cally, the aims of the pro-ject, as told to Felix by Steve Howe, are:\n\u2022 Revitalising the services within the\nMechanical Engineering building.\n\u2022 Extensively refurbish the southern\ncolumn and south-eastern annexe\nof the Mechanical Engineering\nbuilding; this is so that Aeronautics can move in there.\n\u2022 Using the above, release the\nRoderic Hill (Aeronautics build-ing) and Bone buildings (Chemi-cal Engineering currently inhabit\nit).\n\u2022 Refurbishment of the northern\nand central columns of the Mechanical Engineering building to\naccommodate Mechanical Engineering.\n\u2022 Connecting the Mechanical Engineering and Skempton buildings\nto allow teaching facilities to be\nshared between multiple departments (Mechanical, Civil and\nAeronautical Engineering and the\nBusiness School).\n\u2022 Improve the aestethics of the ImNot just a superficial\nchange for South Ken\nperial buildings with more modern facades to complete Exhibition Road and Unwin Road.\nThe Mechanical Engineering building was the \ufb01rst to be noticeably chang-ing. The services within it have reached\nthe end of their working life and are increasing the risk associated with operations inside the building. Mr Howe said\nthat \u201cnumerous elements and services\nare approaching the end of their life\nexpectancy\u201d and mentioned the \u201cpressing need to renew the areas to meet the\ncurrent requirement for a world leading engineering research and teaching\nfacility\u201d\n. The AMP gives the opportunity to meet current health and safety\nstandards as well as energy standards.\nDuring the project there will be an\nalmost musical chairs required to complete it. The optimum phasing has been\nfound by representatives from the departments involved agreeing them. The\nphasing of the project, which is to say\nthe practicality of where and how it is\ndone, has been agreed on a \u201croom by\nroom\u201d basis. Mr Howe also said that\n\u201cparticular requirements for teaching,\nresearch or support functions\u201d have\nbeen recognised, hence the room by\nroom analysis.\nDiscussing the project, Mr Howe\nsaid that \u201cthe AMP projects provides\nfor the collocation of the Department of Aeronautics into the existing\nMechanical Engineering Annexe and\nSkempton Buildings and, at the same\ntime, refurbish the remainder of the\nMechanical Engineering Building\u201d. He\nwent on to say that the project \u201caims\nto refurbish the buildings in a way that\nensures their long-term sustainability\nbut which avoids the cost of radical\nrestructuring.\u201d At the same time, the\nproject will address the fact that some\nbuildings are over 40 years old. How\nsaid that it will address \u201cthe backlog of\nmaintenance issues, the external fabric\nof the building and the services, plant\nand infrastructure\u201d. The project will\nalso free up space, which is currently\noccupied by the Roderick Hill and\nACEX buildings.\nWith respect to the new facade of\nthe Mechanical Engineering building,\nconstruction of which was completed\nin early summer of this year, there\nhas been some response from those\ninvolved. Plans for the works on the\nbuilding, situated in the South East\ncorner of the South Kensington Campus, were proposed in 2010, when the\nCollege was informed by local authorities of the full extent of their plans for\nimprovements to Exhibition Road.\nPlans for the \u00a31.19 million project were\napproved in 2011, with the initial plans\nbeing produced by regular College architects Sheppard Robson and further\ndesign, as well as the \ufb01nal construc-tion, carried out by D&B Facades.\nFacilities Management Director\nNicholas Roalfe told Felix: \u201cMy view is\nthat the Recladded Annex provides the\n\ufb01rst visual impression of Imperial College London especially with the London 2012 Olympic and World Wide\naudience. The location is very prominent with the Exhibition Road Campus\nbuildings, including the setting with\nthe other neighbouring buildings and\nthe Local Authorities improvements to\nExhibition Road.\nIn terms of quality, the impression\nis of a new building albeit the original\nAnnex Building structure remains. In\nmy opinion, it is a vast improvement\non the original 50+ year old building,\nwhose window and fabric had gone\npast its economic life . To date, we have\nreceived many compliments from College Sta\ufb00, Students and Local Neighbours\u201d\nAs well as improving the building\u2019s\nouter image the new facade was also\ndesigned to improve its energy e\ufb03ciency. Nicholas Roalfe added: \u201c the\ncladding is also having a signi\ufb01cant\nimpact on the building thermal perfor-mance, it isn\u2019t just a redecoration of the\nbuilding\u201d.\nThe new facade is just the \ufb01rst phase\nAeronautical Mechanical Engineering Project, which aims to refurbish\nnot only the Mechanical Engineering\nbuilding but also parts of Skempton,\nwith a \ufb01nal goal of creating space to\nallow the Department of Aeronautical\nEngineering to move into the buildings and join the other departments\nalready housed there.
