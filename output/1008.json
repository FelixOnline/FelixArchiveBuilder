However UCL began to pull\naway, taking advantage of our\nlack of experience in playing\ntogether, and soon established a good lead.\nDespite IC winning the last\nquarter and keeping a positive\nattitude right to the end, UCL\nwent on to win the match.\nWith many first and second\nteam fixtures coming up, we look\nforward to seeing any keen\nplayers at practices, Thursday 12\n- 2pm on the netball court next to\nLinstead Hall.\nFootball LU\nICWAFC vs ua\nAs per usual, the Dribblers were\nshort of players, by two this time,\nhaving been let down by four\nladies. Never the less, we went out\non the pitch hungry for goals.\nNeither team scored for\nabout 30 minutes, until a deflection off our right, back's knee went passed our keeper,\nwho was new to the job.\nWe held up very well in the.\nsecond half, putting the pressure\non them, but unfortunately\nmissed several chances. Despite\nso in e excellent defending, they\nscored 4 more goals. Late, in the,\nsecond half, Erica ran up the left\nwing, beat their keeper and put.\nthe ball in the back of the net. We\nmanaged to gain a few free kicks\nand corners, but, they didn't pay\noff.\nThanks to all who played,\n100% effort!\nFootball 0\nICMenlstvsUCL\nIt. was with high expectations di at IC made the long trip to play\nUCL on Saturday and we were\nnot to be disappointed. After 10\nminutes, IC's superior skill and\ndetermination led to our first, goal\nof die match. Decoy runs by the\nfull-backs Ben Willis and Rich\nCraig left the opportunity for Wai\nKwok to send an inch-perfect\ncross to Tim Lewis who headed\nthe ball Shearer-like past the\nhelpless keeper. Some strange\nrefereeing led to Mike Jarvis\nstripping on the touch line, however the last, laugh was with\nMike as the Ref felt, distinctly\nunder-endowed. After 10 minutes\nof more possession football, we\nfelt it. was time to extend our lead\nand after a Giggs-like s line y(?! Ed.) by Ike Ombala, he found\nhimself in space 25 yards out, and\nsent a spectacular curling shot\ninto the top right corner: two -nil. A third goal came soon after\nwhen Tim Lewis again headed\nthe ball home after a delightful\ncross from Bill \"Kebab\".\nThe second half consisted of\nthe IC back four soaking up\npressure and die midfield and\nattack breaking regularly to try to\nincrease the lead. Some dreadful\nfinishing by Wai and Bill only\nstopped them. Hopes are now\nhigh for IC in both the UAU and\nthe League.\nRugby HI\nOn d XV ff i UCl For the second week running we\ncouldn't, quite put. a performance\ngood enough to win a UAU group\nmatch. Conceding two tries in\neach half, IC could only manage\ntwo scores of their own in the last,\nquarter of an hour.\nChristophe Sugden powered\nhis way over from a metre out,\nafter some good work by the\npack. The second IC try came\ncourtesy of Mark Wishart after a scintillating run by Aled Bowen.\nUnfortunately this was not\nenough and IC succumbed by the\nmargin of 22-12.\nI'm the brand new Sports Editor\nfor FELIX. The idea, for this\nyear, is to have one page in every\nissue dedicated to die sport results\nfor the week. Because results\nwhich are one week out, of date\nare of less interest, the sport teams\nwill be operating to a different,\ndeadline than for those submitting\narticles. The sport page will be\ndone on the Wednesday evening\nto go into the issue 2 days later.\nThis means that current results\ncan be reported. It also means\nthat I need to be certain that I will\nbe given enough material to fill a page as by then most, of FELIX is already printed and there is no\nmargin for change.\nAs you can see, there are 2\nparts in the page:\nOne part is presented as a table with the results. Hopefully,\nwe will get all the results, for all\nteams in all sports played\nduring the week. This hasn't, been\nthe case this week, but, thanks to\nall those who have given us their\nresults. I hope that more teams\nwill do so next week. All that I need is a phone call on\nWednesday evening (before 8pm, so that 1 can finish the page before\n3am!) telling us your sport:, team,\nopponent's team and the score.\nFor those wondering about the\norder the teams appear in the\ntable, this is how they are\narranged: The winning IC teams\nalphabetical approach is used.\nThe other part contains the\nreports of the matches. These\nrefer to the results in the table.\nThis means that, the reports for\nthose who play on Wednesdays\nhave to be given in the same day!\nThose playing earlier in the week\nhave a bit more time but I still\nneed the articles by Wednesday\nevening (before 8pm). The length\nof the reports will have to depend\non how many I receive.\nI know that I'm not giving\nmuch time for people to write up,\nbut, I'm afraid this is the price to\npay in order to get up to date\nresults printed. I also need to be\n100% confident that I will have\nenough materials to get a full page\ndone by the end of Wednesday (I won't be writing such a big\neditorial every week, so I need\nmore articles!). If it is not. the\ncase, then that will be the end of\nthe Sports Page. It, is not easy to\nget a page done at. the last minute\nand it requires a lot of\norganisation.\nIf you've got any comment, or\nwant to ask anything, come and\nsee me in FELIX or just leave a message if I'm not, in.\nJuliette Decock\nSports Editor\n024 FELIX2 I0CT94 "

    "content": "News\nThieves Sweep\nImperial College\nI! Id\nPlaytime: Arag ster and friend during Monopoly\nBY RACHEL WALTERS AND LYNN BRAVEY\nA two student crime wave was\nstopped in its tracks when a hapless duo found themselves locked\ninside the Department of\nElectrical and Electronic\nEngineering department last\nSaturday.\nThe youths, from Warwick\nUniversity and the University of\nWestminster had to call security\nwhen locks supposed to keep\nthem out kept them in instead.\nThe two were so hopelessly lost\nthat they had to describe their\nsurroundings to college staff\nbefore they could get out.\nWhen security searched their\nbags, the department's signing-in\nbook, and an assortment of mail\ntaken from the post-graduate\npigeon holes were recovered. The\nstudents arc being dealt with by\ntheir own University disciplinary\nproceed ure s. Terry Brilcy, Deputy\nHead of Security, commenting on\nthe event, stressed the need for\nidentification before holding open\nswipe-card doors for strangers.\nIn another incident last\nSaturday, brass plates outside the\nUnion Building were stolen.\nMissing ije ms|n clude the ICU\nplaque, tl at wals screwed to the\nwall adj a pent lo Beit. Arch, and\nthe FELIX-.sign..-, .........\nRag Collectors have been\nblamed for the disappearances\nwhich occurred during a Rag\nparty. The party had been organised by Mencap to thank the Rag\nCollectors that had travelled from\nall around the country to London\nto participate in the IC Rag\nMonopoly.\nThe ICU sign was removed\nfrom the front wall of the union\nsecurity lodge. The lodge is\nmanned 24 hours a day.\nOne theft was foiled by a Union Steward. At approximately\n11.40pm the steward noticed that\nthe ICU doormat, which is usually\nsited in the entrance doorway of\nthe Union Building, had been\ntaken. Following a patrol the mat\nwas located and locked away in\nthe Union Office for safekeeping.\nIt. is estimated that around 1200\npeople attended the party. The\nUnion has discussed the thefts\nwith Mencap. Lucy Chotia, ICU\nPresident emphasised that they\nwere not taking the idea of charging the charity 'lightly' but, added\nthat, the sign 'obviously had to be\nreplaced.'\nSouvenir stealing by\n'Raggies' is fairly common on\nthese excursions and IC Rag\nChairman Ian Robertson admit-ted, \"We've not been totally innocent of it in the past!.\"\nMedics Give RCS Problems\nBY ANDY SINIIARAY\nThe Royal College of Science's vintage fire engine, affectionately\nknown as Jcz, may be evicted\nfrom her present garage if plans\nto replace the old Chemistry\nbuilding go ahead.\nAlthough plans lor the\nreplacement of the building with\na new Biomedical Centre have\nnot yet, been officially approved,\nthe RCS Union and its Motor\nClub have expressed concern\nabout, the demise of the building,\nin which the RCS Union office is\nalso based. In interviews with\nFELIX, Mr Jon Turner of the\nRCS Motor Club and the MrCharlie Bell, President of the\nRCSU both said that nothing definite had been heard. They added\nthat, any movement of the fire\nengine away from the College site\nwould deny many students the\nopportunity to work on Jez in\ntheir spare time.\nJez was donated to the students of the RCS in 1955 for\nwhat was described as her 'edu-cation al value'. Mr Turner said,\n\"She's been kept going since - by\nstudents and ex-students, most of\nwhom work for engineering firms.\nShe commands that, much loyal-ty...she really is a labour of love,\nand she's very pretty. She's not\ncalled Jezebel for nothing. People\nget involved with the motor club\nand end up devoting half their\nlives to her.\"\nHe added that Jez could not\nbe simply put 'anywhere', as tool\nspace and maintenance facilities\nare required. The present garage\nis located directly beneath the\nRCSU office, and was specially\nextended to accomodate the vintage vehicle. The official presidential transport of the RCSU, Jez\nhas already been present, at the\nFresher's Fair, the RAG\nTiddlywinks and was even used\nas the jail van in the RAG\nMonopoly last. Saturday. Jez will\nalso be going to Brighton in\nNovember with Bo', City &\nGuilds' veteran car.\nThere is concern too over the\npotential fate of the RCSU office.\nHowever, the Imperial College\nDirector of Estates, Mr Ian\nCaldwell, assured FELIX that\nhe is \"sensitive to the needs of the\nUnion\". He added that though\nthe current priority was to obtain\nofficial approval from the Higher\nEducation Funding Council and\nthe Department of Health for the\nnew building, the RCS would be\nconsulted in January. No work\nwould begin until next summer at.\nthe earliest. \"But. we've got. a responsibility to house them\nsomewhere,\" he said.\nliT M FELIX2 I0CT94 "

    "content": "Standby\nff i chills\nFor people with too much taste for\nHammersmith Palais, here are the\nfirst of my recommendations for\nIC's late night dancing crowd. On\nFridays, Barely Breaking Even at\nClub 9, is a must. By far the best\nlocal club, at \u00a34 for NUS/UB40\nthis is truly a bargain. Surprisingly\nunpretentious for Kensington, it\nalso gets my top award for\nfriendliest door woman\ncongratulations Bijal! - and the\nwelcome extends thru'out this\nexcellently decorated venue. The\nground floor chill out room plays\njazzy tunes to chat to; move\ndownstairs for the action. Drinks\nare standard club prices: \u00a32 a shot\nor \u00a32.50 for beers, so you may\nwell want to fill up at the Union\nbefore grabbing a few friends and\npiling over for some excellent\ndance able funk and boogie tunes\nspun by DJs Ben, sweet Pete and\nLeslie O.I defy anyone to keep off\nthe dancefloor here, and\nexhibitionists wear white as it's lit\nwith UV. Superb wall hangings\nand a wandering saxophonist add\nthe perfect finish to this packed\nout, fashionable club.\nClub 9 is situated at 9 Young\nStreet (just off High St Ken).\nHometime munchies are available\nall night just round the corner at\nCrispins.\nMidweek, Starsky and Hutch upstairs at Ronnie Scotts,\nSoho, is a personal favourite. A complete lack of pretentiousness\ncoupled with everybody's best\nloved 70's Funk make this the\nideal venue for its young sociable\nparty crowd. DJ's Andy G and Kris\nspin what are, in my opinion, the\nbest funk tunes in town. A roomy\nseating area makes conversation\neasy, and you'll find plenty of it,\nwhile the dancefloor is rarely\nempty. The staffs' student friendly\nattitude is indicated by the free\njugs of cold water available along\nthe bar and the generous drinks\nprices (\u00a31.60 for Becks to \u00a32 for\nstronger beers). Lap up the free\nwhistles and lollies, while those\nbest dressed in 70's gear win free\ncopies of Telstar's new Acid Jazz\nCD. Mention my name and\nentrance is JUST \u00a33. Night buses\nare 10 minutes walk away at\nPiccadilly, and there are a plethora of late night eating\nplaces nearby, with Bar Italia\nopposite and Compton's wonderful sandwiches round the\ncorner. Grab a crowd and have a great night out. Q affirming\nsituations\n^ teutonic upgrading\nThe first half of the Royal Opera's new Ring cycle is a failure. But that's certainly not the whole story. Richard Jones' new productions of Das\nRheingold and Die Walkure are more courageous and interesting than\nthe last two Wagner offerings from this house. Prettified and empty\nstagings of Der fliegende Hollander and Die Meistersinger won critical\nraves in other quarters, and Jones too could have played safe. Instead he\nhas rejected the winged helmets and all the Tolkienesque paraphernalia\nusually associated with these works. He'll have known the risks he was\nrunning and sure enough a river of vilification poured down from the\ngallery when he took his curtain call.\nThere are some good ideas. Alberich wears his ring on a huge\ndetachable fist. When he turns into a dragon, he is hoisted into the air\nlike an enormous jack-in-the-box, with his trousers uncoiling below him.\nThe giants Fasolt and Fafner are Siamese twins, their torsos joined.\nIn Walkure, Fricka makes an effective departure in a lead-coloured\nlimousine that looks like a life-size Monopoly token. There is certainly\nroom for humour and even mockery (Wotan's spear is a one-way street\nroad sign), but Jones seems to have been unwilling or unable to trust in\nthe potency of Wagner's own ideas. It's as if he's decided that these days\nwe're all too sophisticated for this dungeons and dragons stuff, and he\nsimply fails to think of anything exciting to do at great moments such as\nthe descent to Nibelheim or the deaths of Siegmund and Hunding.\nBernard Haitink and his orchestra seem unconvinced and the playing only\nintermittently rises above the perfectly acceptable. The net result is that\nwhat are potentially some of the greatest passages in opera fall\nun for giv ably flat. The good news is that the singing is excellent,\nparticularly that of John Tomlinson's Wotan and Ekkehard Wlaschiha's Alberich. \u00a9\nWhile 'the Firm' and 'the Pelican\nBrief failed to capture John\nGrisham's writing, the Client is\nprobably the best of the adaptions\nso far onto the silver screen.\nIts plot revolves around Mark\nSway, an eleven year old boy who\nknows too much. When Mark and\nhis younger brother, Ricky, sneek\ninto the woods for a smoke, they\nsee a man attaching a hose to the\nexhaust pipe of his car with the\nobvious intent of committing\nsuicide. The man turns out to be a Mafia lawyer who, during his last\nminutes, tells Mark about a killer\nand the whereabouts of the body\nof a prominent Senator.\nA federal prosecutor named\n'Reverend' Roy Foltrigg (Tommy\nLee Jones) wants Mark to tell him\nwhere the body is hidden, while\nthe Mafia want him to keep quiet.\nIn desperation Mark goes to a lawyer, Reggie Love played by\nSusan Sarandon, for help. She\ntakes on the FBI and manages to\ndeal with their subversive\ntechniques to persuade Mark to\ntell them everything.\nAs a screen play the Client is\nextremely close to the book, and\nhas more suspense than other\nJohn Grisham adaptions. If you\nhave read the book you will be\nsurprised about the film. It has an\nexcellent plot that is little changed.\nIf you wanted to know where\nMonty Python got the idea for their\nclassic film, the Holy Grail, from\nthe film to endure is Lancelot du\nLac. Although it strangely\nmanaged to win the Cannes\nfestival in 1974, (interesting the\nHoly Grail was released in 1975),\nits 35mm reissue can only be\nassumed to be a horrible faux pas.\nThe opening scene cuts to a broadsword fight. One knight\nmanages to chop the other's head\nclean off, which results in a veritable fountain of gushing red\nwater. Next the victorious knight\nswings at someone else's helmet -cue for more fountains of red\nwater spouting everywhere. By this\npoint the assembled critics in the\npress showing were howling with\nlaughter and I was waiting for\nsome smart alec k to start on the\nBlack Knight sketch; \"well it's only\na scratch\", \"only a scratch I 've just\ncut your arm off\" etc.\nBasically it's the worst french\nfilm I have ever seen.\u00a9\nfurther details can be found in the seven day diary\n2I0CT94 FELIX MM\n\n"

    "content": "Interview\nA MECHANICAL ALTAR I'm sitting in Fiction Records. I know that's the case because all around the walls are\nslacks of gold and silver discs which record the\nsales of various Cure albums. I'm sitting in a large leather sofa, holding a cup of tea and\nfeeling ill. Upstairs are the remaining members\nof the God Machine whom I'm waiting to\ninterview. The whole scenario is equivalent to\na dentist's waiting room, except that instead of\nthe Mail on Sunday magazine MTV shrieks\nfrom a nearby TV. A receptionist asks for my\nname, and tells me to wait as things are\nrunning late. A prematurely balding man sits\ndown opposite. We smile pale ly at each other.\nSo why am I nervous? I try to persuade\nmyself that this interview won't be\nproblematic. I ignore the fact that the God\nMachine have been described as \"one of the\nmost difficult bands I 've ever interviewed\" by\none of the most egotistical national press\nm usos and forget that I spent all morning\ntrying to make sense of a thirty page press\npack full of every superlative in the dictionary.\nI try to ignore the gaping fact that after\nlistening to their new album at least, three\ntimes a day for over a week I'm still unsure\nwhether I like it. But most importantly I attempt to expel the big one. The God\nMachine used to be a trio, but in May, Jimmy\nthe bassist died suddenly of a brain tumour.\nHow am 1 supposed to deal with that in a music interview? Once again my head starts to\nspin and I wonder what they've put in my lea\nFinally my time comes and I'm escorted\nupstairs to meet. Robin Proper-Sheppard and I Ronald Austin. They're never really what you\nexpect from looking at the press pictures\nRobin is slightly more eager: Ronald just looks I big and dark. |\nThe first part of an interview is always\nthe most vulnerable bit. I set up my equipment I while we make polite talk to try and work out 1\nhow the next thirty minutes will go. I start off I on a standard question; how would they\ndescribe their music? It's not rock or heavy\nmetal but it has a classical feel to it in terms of f construction and use of instruments. Ronald I starts off but Robin quickly cuts in. \"We've\nnever been about being in a rock band\" he, |\nsays, except, that it comes out like\n\"www wwe 're never...\" The man has a stutter. I After reading at least a dozen interviews not 1\none person mentioned it. I mean it's not\nimportant for their music but as a human 1\nattribute you can't really ignore it. Suddenly I and stupidly I feel better and we can get on I with the interview.\nI ask another standard question about I Robin's lyrics. They're pretty sparse and I simple but the way he repeats them gives die\nsongs a sort of polemic impact. You end up I The God Machine's second\nand final album 'One Last\nLaugh In A Place Of Laying...' was released after the\ndeath of their bassist.\nTintin tried to tread\ncarefully.\ngetting ground down by their sheer strength.\nRobin agrees, \"I can define how I'm feeling in\na relatively short space of time and even\nthough people might hot understand what I'm expressing, if it only takes me four lines...why\nnot?\" Except the strange thing is that in the\nflesh Robin talks non-stop. In contrast to his\nsongs now he's neither sparse or simple and he\ndoesn't repeat himself, he just creates closely\nintertwined arguments which back track to\ncover all flanks. Ronald the drummer mainly\njust sits in silence.\nI ask whether they think an intensity\ncomparison between them and Henry Rollins\nis valid. Robin starts up again. \"I think that,\nthis last album we couldn't have created a more pure album, just the whole approach, the\nwhole execution of it, how we decided to\napproach it after Jimmy's passing away, we\ncouldn't have done it any differently...\" There\nit was, just slipped in. It took me a second to\nregister but that was it, Jimmy had passed\naway. Obviously they had come to terms with\nhis death or else they wouldn't have been\ndoing interviews with student newspapers but\nnevertheless that, in some morbid way, was\nwhat I had come to hear. Later on it became\napparent that the God Machine as a group\nwere finished. The band that three Americans\nwho had known each other from childhood\nand flown over to London to start up had\nfinished. Without Jimmy the band is dead.\nWe cover some other topics; can music\nchange the world? - \"I know it changes me\",\nCobain and Vedder as the tortured messiahs of\nmusic - \"they're expressing what they're\nfeeling\", Winnie the Pooh \u2014 \"we have a song\nwhich is influenced by Winnie the Pooh,\nWinnie the Pooh is cool\" and other stuff and I think that I 've done ok. We end up talking\nabout Nick Cave, who everyone thinks is\nbrilliant, before I get to say \"well thanks for\nyour time I'm out of questions\". I start to pack\nup and we small talk until Robin says, \"what\ndid you think of the album?\" I sit there slightly\nstunned for a bit before I begin to squirm.\n\"Wei! I 've not had it for more than a week, and\nI don't really like heavy metal stuff.\" It's a bad\nmistake and one which 1 immediate realise.\nRobin fires back \"we're not heavy metal\",\nsharply because it's an accusation. Yeah I know that but what else do you call it - heavy\ninstrumental driven rock with classical\nundertones and lyrical raw power? I keep\nsquirming out of a direct answer and manage\nto escape to some degree but I still felt kinda\nannoyed. Wh\u00b0 was being interviewed after all?\nIn hindsight I realised that the interview\nhad become a conversation and Robin actually\nwanted to know what I thought. Now I can tell\nyou that the album's very good. I can't say\nwhether you'll like it though. 13\n2I0CT94 FELIX "

    "content": "Incoming\n\"Concerned\" of Tunbridge Wells, on the demise of Beit\nQuad... Vote of thanks from Rag... A Failure writes...\nDoorgirl's answer...\nEdited this week\nby Tim St. Clair\nThe Beit\nSquad?\nDear Sir,\nDespite only being an Imperial\nstudent for one fortnight so far, I read with considerable outrage the\nplans currently under discussion for\nthe Beit Quad (\"Confidential Drift\",\nFelix 1007).\nWhilst not particularly caring\nwhere the Union is situated, I nevertheless feel that the Beit Quad\nshould remain for student/student-related use. The article suggested\nthat the use of Beit Quad for conferences would boost their at ten dance, owing to its picturesque\naspect. Are the students deemed\nunable to appreciate the Beit Quad\nand worthy only of the architectural\nfinesse of Sherfield? It cannot be\njustified, students having to hand\nover their quad to conference delegates who would appreciate for all\nof three days. Moreover, to re-it er ate the article the largest room in\nthe quad holds three hundred,\nsurely inappropriate for conference\nneeds. Since conference attendance needs \"revitalising\" that is,\nthey are not a pressing issue, will\nnot Southside suffice?\nWe read of an \"expected influx\"\nof students in forthcoming years\nand of the associated acute lack of\nspace to house them.

Just ask them!\nBaggie Thanks\nDear Felix,\nRag would like to thank everyone who took part in Monopoly\nand Tiddlywinks. Special thanks to\nthose on Jez and Clem, Ian, Dan,\nDave, Richard and Steve for driving\nminibuses, and everybody who\nhelped count money and Sam\nScotcher for keeping Monopoly\nrunning smoothly.\nWe would also like to thank the\nAZ map company and Waddington's Games for donating prizes.\nIan Robertson, Tim Atkinson\n(Rag Chair, Rag Treasurer)\nGeez guys, I'm outta breath -haven't either of you heard of full\nstops?\nDramSocked\nDear Owain,\nIt is sadly not unusual or even\nundesirable for papers to print\nprovocative stories that are only\ntenuously rooted in truth. Reality is\nso much more mundane than\n\"imaginative\" reporters would have\nus believe. We should not therefore be surprised at Rebecca\nMileham's report (FELIX:\n7/10/94) on the incipient dangers\nof Dramsoc to the academic health\nof the fragile Imperial student.\nHowever, what sits rather more\nuncomfortably is the masquerading\nof what seems a rather distasteful\nand virulent personal offensive as a piece of objective journalism.\nSurely we are presented with\nsomething more suited to the\ncolourful regions of an opinions\npage. Opinions are often proposed with maximum zeal and\nminimum qualification; they're nurtured on half-truths, as it is only\ntheir half that interests them. And\nthe intrepid Miss Mileham certainly\nwastes little of her precious time\nburrowing for a balance, that\nwould be sweaty, arduous work\nand one might arrive at rather different conclusions from those that\nmade this noble endeavour p ossi ble. For instance, I would be\ngreat fully enlightened (and not a little surprised!) if she could identify\nthis whispering chorus of disapproval that \"cite\" and \"raise\ndoubts\" about the commitment that\nDramsoc \"demands (!)\" of it's members.\nWe should recognise that the\nproblems of motivation in academic are not Society specific, but\nspecific to the individual.\nMercifully, priorities cannot be prescribed and each one of us may\nmake of our time at university what\nwe choose; Miss Mileham would\nprobably call this dissipation, I rather like to think of it as an\nessential freedom.\nThe activities of the Dramatic\nSociety are moulded by the enthusiasms of it's members. One cannot be dictated to in amateur the-at re, PERSAUSION is the ruling\nprinciple of any successful project!\nIt is a miscalculation, damaging\nto the integrity of your publication,\nto represent malicious rumour as\ntruth...or was this just Feline mis-chi e vous ness?! Yours sincerely,\nIqbal Khan\nDramsoc President\nIqbal, Iqbal, Iqbal - what precise\nmalicious rumours did this article\npropagate? Did you not fail your\nsecond year? Did the article not\nhave quotes from an ex-president to\nthe effect that DramSoc commitments caused him no academic\nproblems? Face it - you're repeating 'cos you didn't put the work in.\nI should know, 'cos I'm doing the\nsame thing - but I'm not blaming\nFELIX for it.\nGet a Life...\nDear Poon,\nIt strikes me that your ignorant\nattitudes need educating. Rather\nthan randomly abusing your\nPresident, perhaps you should\ndirect yo iur comments at the person that actually kicked you out.\nHaving suffered approximately\ntwenty minutes of your pathetic\nand offensively unoriginal w hinge ing, I personally felt that your presence in Beit Quad lowered the\nstandard of the whole event. As\nyou would know, if you had a life,\nany other venue in London would\nhave charged you more and kicked\nyou further.\nFor future reference, your\nremoval was instigated by the\nmanager of the week's events,\nNOT the President. Also, if you\nexpect to be welcomed at any late\nnight bar, attitudes that take the\npiss are not to be recommended.\nThe Double-Six Club is a great\nnight out for anyone with a sense\nof humour and bar extensions have\nto be paid for. Personally, I thought the action we took was\ntotally reasonable. Blaggers never\nget very far.\nI look forward to further abuse,\nFiona\nBiology 3\nWay to go, Fiona!

It\ndidn't say much at all, it just kicked\nyou in the stomach and stole your\nwallet. But that was punk and this is\nnow. And now we're post-modern.\nIt's something that the John\nspencer blues explosion appear\nto have understood. Their new\nalbum, 'orange' comes in lower\ncase characters on a shiny silver\ncover of marketing purity. Inside is\na coiled stream of immediacy. Put\nit on and you're prepared for action\nas jon shrieks out and cuts in to\naction.\nSo is it Blues? Not the\ntraditional sort 'cos history's dead.\nNo, this is post-modern blues in the\nsame way that Come are; intense\nwith all the right riffing but\nseemingly little content. But if you\nwant some self-referential\ntreatment, get a load of the 'blues X man' complete with Tom Waites\nbackgrounds vocals and slashing\nchord structures. A fashion\nstatement? Swing out with\n'bell bottoms'. Of course this isn't really a problem, 'orange' is a young album,\nwhich is as full of swaggering rock as\ninstrumental wit as nervous energy.\nThe first time you let it go, Whammm,\nit's a(9). Equally significant is when\nthis sort of classic album is reduced to\nan (8) by any play thereafter. (8)\nStart listening to Motocaster's second album, 'Stay Loaded', and\nyou'd be forgiven for thinking that\nthis was merely a good excuse to\nplay songs influenced by cult guitar\nbands.\n'The Buddha' sounds like The\nFall with balls, while 'The Habit'\nbuilds on a riff taken from the Jesus\nLizard school book. That's something Motocaster should\ndefinitely kick since as the album\nprogresses too many of the songs\nsuffer from the, 'Oh, they're going\nto ram a single, filthy riff down my\nthroat' prediction. Still it's quite\ninteresting listening, what with the\nNirvana-style harmonies on\n'Uranus' and the metallic jam of\n'Motorolla Blues'.

Unfortunately the\nguitars and drums are mixed way\ntoo low to allow for any real bite,\nbut they have a sense of humour\nand this should see them going\ndown a storm when they tour with\nthose j a pesters, Terrorvision. (6)\nSo it goes. Freshers' Balls must\nbe mass-produced to ensure the\nmaximum amount of tedium,\nguaranteed every time. It doesn't matter where they are, they all\nhave the same ident ik it stink of\ncheap bear, cheaper thrills and the\nobligatory bargain-basement lust.\nFun-da-mental's onslaught of\nright-on rap did its best to keep us\ninterested, but they were always on\nto a loser.

They sweated\nand screamed; threw in musical\ninfluences with wild abandon and\ngenerally rapped their PC little\nI hearts out.\nThe problem, you see, is that\nlive Fun-da-mental are distinctly\naverage.

The\nwindows are all sealed and there's security on\nthe door so should the worst happen I 'll have to\ncall in the cavalry to get me out. Having left my\nportable satellite kit at home I head instead for\nthe phones. There are two booths situated on\nfloor one, just up the steps from reception. The\nfirst (07715875200) stinks really badly. It's a card phone so maybe its just the smell of the\nevil workings of plastic I scuttle to the next\nbooth, just on the left as you enter the Haldane\nsection. This one (07775895336) is much nicer,\nis a coin phone and probably a good place to\nfind a companion as the walls are covered with\nmessages from lonely hearts and there are\nquotes too. \"The mind is a terrible thing to\nwaste\" - Martin Luther King. And I thought he'd been shot, he must come in to read NME in the\ncool music bit. And if the Guardian Media\nSupplement is occasionally stolen that's life.\nSneaking through the columns of fiction I notice how good they are for pretending to be\na private detective spying on young girls\nreading Betjeman poems. That was my excuse\nanyway. In the north west through the stairwell\nI find steps to a secret door. Staff Only.\nHmmmm. There is a surreal lift sign asking you\nto note that if the lift has stopped someone may\nbe trapped in it and just outside we discover the\nAudio-Visual room. This has laser discs, video\nplayers etc. and could be excellent; a great\nhang-out for the colleges' Beavis and Buttheads\nbut alas its for 'college purposes only'. The\nagenda. Time to climb the stairs to level two.\nLEVEL2\nFirst stop for my erstwhile companion is the\ngents on the right. He considered them\n'excessively pungent' but then he is a purist.\nThe general periodical room on the west has an\nexcellent wide corridor between desks and\nshelves for holding sports events overnight\nshould you become trapped. The east side has\nsecret doors to the north and the skeleton of\nthe old Haldane to Sherfield bridge, now bolted\nup. The fortress-like windows here are great for\nspying on summer crowds on the Queen's Lawn\nand firing arrows through.\nWithin the quietness of the library the\nonly place of action and sound is the\nphotocopying room. A possible idea here\ncould be to synchronise the copies for excellent\nst robing disco effects. Passing through into the\nold Science Museum library, there is a conference centre on the left full of STS\nstudents who seem curious when we appear at\ntheir door and scribble down notes whilst\npointing. Keen minds. Just down and on the left\nin the Oasis. More toilets, a little degenerate on\nour visit, but the superlative water fountain is\nhere! This has the prime revision tables are on\nthe left. I saved my degree here.\nFurther down the wall live the amusingly\ntitled 'abstract tables'. Good joke there but they\nlook pretty normal to me. There is also a localised outbreak of electronic wizardry with\nthe soon to be installed 8 machine worldwide\nweb cluster. There's also stacks of microfiche\nreaders, CD-ROM machines and other equally\nnameless yet 'democratic' systems.\nItS HAfw IIIMWAI\" ^BBLm coot \u2022\u00ab* Xce.tr * t mn JS; ALA** ft *\nt Sw u?Sc \u00ab\n*\n'\n\" 1 A*s T*AcT TA6L \u00a3 s WT To a eT to At is wAT el MtflAirf \u00a9 JoML COB d. LEVEL3\nThe further up you get in the library, the\nsparser and stranger are the students you get to\nmeet. Entering the Computing and Control\nCollection we come across the closest thing to\norganised religion at IC. Kneel and worship at\nthe heart of the scientific ideal. Yep it's the\nDennis Gabor Shrine. Busts, medals, Noble\nprizes, bits of flat screen tel lies, it's all there\nbehind glass cabinets which have signs saying\n'do not touch the glass'. Noble prize medals\nare remarkably similar to fish in this respect.\nAn interesting man, Dennis was quoted\nin one newspaper cutting as saying that the two\nproblems for humanity are boredom and\nimpotence. He was obviously an IC professor\nthrough and through.\nLEVEL 4\nAt the end of our brief tour we climb the stairs\nto Life Science and Management. It's secluded\nand very quiet and that probably accounts for\nall the dark and sordid rumours that encircle\nthe photocopy room. Well at least it could be\ncalled the Biology reproduction room. There's not much else of interest up here. The access\npassage between Life Science and\nManagement has no lights and the walls\nvibrate too. We don't stay long in Management.\nThe final bell is tolling as nine o 'clock is\napproaching. There's just enough time to\nread the cartoons stuck onto the librarian's door. If you have any more on the theme of\ndesigning tree swings I'm sure that they\nwould find a good home there.\ndatabases and keyword anarchy\nBooks have always had an element of power\nassociated with them. Censorship trials such\nas 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' meant that some\nbooks at least, had the kudos of hidden\nknowledge associated with them, things that\nthe common man should not know about.\nThanks to its computerised referencing systems\nthe IC library provides an anonymous and fast\nservice to find those useful handbooks for\nanarchy, ill ict satisfaction and addiction.\nI used the on line keyword facility to try\nand build up an inter-reference of particularly\ninteresting ideas. I played around for a bit\nbefore trying the sensual keywords\ncombinations of SEX-RUBBER and SEX-OIL\nbut to no avail. SEX-TECHNOLOGY had three\nclose matches but un surprisingly these were\nall along the lines of genetic engineering or\nwomen in science. The first useful answer\nappeared when two vital underlying concepts\nwere put together. SEX-DRUGS resulted in\n'Drugs and Sexual Function' by M. Davies. Alas\nthe only copy was held at St. Mary's. After that\nthere was obviously only one way to go.\nhowever SEX-DRUGS-ROCK and ROLL only\nmanaged to track down E. Stanford's 'the rock\nand roll years...the Riddles designed War\nDepartment'. Staying with substance abuse\nthe next sequence was simpler\nADDICTION-DRUGS combined to give three\ngood leads; the journal of 'Addiction', the\n'British Journal of Addiction' and\nSonnedecker's 'Emergence of the concept of\nopiate addiction'. Finally in nihilist gloom I tried ANARCHY-DEATH which surprisingly came\nback with the hopeful answer of 'Anarchy and\nCulture; the problems of contemporary\nuniversity' (Hal 375). They'd obviously never\nbeen to IC.\nA Humanities library at IC? A Music library?\nYes, for decades Imperial has \u2014 like comparably\nspecialised institutions, LSE and MIT - given its\nmembers the opportunity to read widely beyond\ntheir subject, and to develop their recreational\ninterests. The Haldane Collection provides all\nthis, and supports the taught courses and\nbroader cultural activities of the Humanities\nProgramme.\nThe Haldane Collection is on the first level\nof the Central Library, with a comfortable\nreading area overlooking the Queen's lawn. All\nmembers of College may borrow from its stock\nof 40,000 books, maps, music scores, and sound\nrecordings, using the Central Library card.\nOpening hours are the same as for the rest of the\nCentral Library.\nThe collection began as a student, union\nfiction library (spurred on by H.G. Wells'\nexhortation to students to show that they were\n\"not barbarians\"), and the Union still has a role\nin providing fiction, as well as popular music\nrecordings. With the formation of what is now\nthe Humanities programme, the library\nbegan to provide course material, and\nassumed the name of Haldane Library,\nafter R.B. Haldane (Viscount Haldane),\nwho had helped bring about the merger of\nImperial's constituent colleges. For several years\nthe formerly separate Haldane Library has been\npart of the Central Library, and its present\nfunction is to support Humanities courses,\nprovide other academic support material such as\nEnglish usage, and to offer a wide range of\nextra-curricular reading matter on subjects of\ncurrent interest, as well as music and other\nlistening matter.\nSubjects covered in die greatest dep di are\nmostly those in which courses are taught, such as\nhistory, politics, philosophy and literature, as\nwell as art and music. Travel and biography are\nwell represented, and other subjects covered\ninclude sport, humour, popular medicine,\npsychology, feminism, crime, law, languages,\nand consumer issues. A mere list of subjects,\nhowever, does not do justice to the interest of the\nThe Haldane Collection and You\ncollection, which embraces the wide-ranging,\nsuch as intellectual and cultural history, and the\nmore peculiar. Recent additions to the new\nbooks display-shelf include, for example, Peter\nGay's The Cultivation of Hatred and a comprehensively illustrated history of Tula\nsamovars. 1 hasten to add that there is also a Vauxhall Nova manual and a guide to the West\nYorkshire Way! We are always glad to have your\nsuggestions for additions to the collection.\nDaily newspapers and more than 60\nmagazines and periodicals are available for\nreading in the library. The latter include Autocar\nand Motor, Radio Times, Newsweek, and Which.\nThere are also periodicals that, support, taught\ncourses, notably history journals, and the foreign\nlanguage magazines Stern and L 'Express. \"Non-book\" holdings include maps (mostly Ordnance\nSurvey, but also some town maps and a new\ncounty street atlas series), and language courses\non cassette, which may be borrowed. The AudioVisual collection, including academic videos and\nvideo player, and the Patent. Office Training\nPackage (an easy-to-use introduction to patents)\non video laser disc, is also situated in the\nHaldane Collection.\nThe Music Library of books, scores and\nsound recordings complements the energetic\nmds ical activity of Imperial. There is a good\nselection of books (shelved in the main loan\nbooks sequence and reference collection) and\nprinted music, including chamber music parts,\ninstrumental solos, vocal scores, and miniature\nscores. The most popular section of the music\nlibrary is undoubtedly recorded music. Classical\nrecordings of interest, to both the new and the\nmore experienced listener are available\non compact disc, cassette and LP, while\njazz, folk and popular music (selected by\na student union buyer) is mostly on\ncassette, with a CD collection beginning.\nBooks and all the materials mentioned\nabove are listed in the Libertas computer\ncatalogue, which is available over the network as\nwell as in the library. There are additional\nhandouts on materials that are difficult to trace,\nand the library staff will always be pleased to\nhelp.\nThe Haldane Collection is not merely a repository, but a venue for live events too. Watch\nout for Anne Harvey and Gabriel Woolf reading\n\"This Excellent Machine\", a programme of\nscience-based poetry and prose on November 9,\nJoy Melville, introducing her biography \"Mother\nof Oscar\" [Wilde], with actress Gerardinc\nMcDcrmottroe on November 28, and Josh Kirby,\nillustrator of Terry Pratchett's novels, talking\nabout his work in the spring.\nAnd finally the library staff. They are here\nto enable you to make the most of resources\n(including databases) and to answer your\nqueries, so please, ask them! They can help you\nuse the library systematically, assist in tracking\ndown particular topics, and if necessary refer\nyou to sources elsewhere. Like anyone else who\nhas invested in education and professional\ntraining, they gain satisfaction from using their\nexperience and building on it, and in turn\nprovide a better service. So, if by your sixth visit,\nyou're still asking for the time or a pencil\nsharpener, and they appear a trifle glazed, try\nasking them to pursue quotations, illustrations,\nor the topic that eludes the keyword index.\nThose, who ultimately get the most out of\nlibraries are the ones who learn to use them\nsystematically, engage the help of the staff, and,\nof course, browse.

    "content": "Clued Up\nCrossword by Catfish\nNEW WORLD\nORDER\nLast year China, the largest\nremaining communist country, had\nthe highest economic growth in the\nworld. This seemed quite surprising\nespecially since the Soviet Union\nand its satellite states proved that\ncommunism did not work. The\nboom in China should be attributed to its reformist leader and\nelder statesman Deng Xiaoping,\nwho turned 90 this summer. In\nrecent years Mr. Deng has retired\nfrom his official posts and Chinawatchers have maintained a death\nwatch, expecting his imminent\ndemise to set in motion political\ntransition and perhaps disorder.\nSome expect the sort of vicious\nfractional conflict over succession\nthat is typical of communist states,\nleading to the fall of the\nCommunist Party. In its place some\nsee the emergence of democracy,\nothers forecast a military takeover.\nFor yet others, a breakup of China\nseems imminent.\nThey are all mistaken. China\nis different from the Soviet Union\nin many respects. There are many\nreasons to suspect that China's present party leadership, headed\nby party chief Jiang Zemin, will\nprevail in a post-Deng era. First, it\nhas pursued an aggressive policy\nof economic reform. These include\nkey institutional changes such as\nbanking and fiscal reform and\nrevamping China's foreign trade\nsystem. Secondly, the resurgence\nof economic reforms since the\nbeginning of the decade suggest\nan unusual degree of agreement\namongst the leadership. A close\nanalysis of the seven member\nPolitburo Standing Committee\n(China's main ruling body) can\nclearly demonstrate this: six of the\nseven members are reformers.\nThird, with the exception of Deng\nXiaoping, the party elders whose\nquarrels seemed to dominate politics in the 1980s are a declining\nforce. Death has already taken a toll on their ranks. Four of the\neight key leaders died in the last\ntwo years, all of them conservative.\nIn short, China's leaders\ncomprise an activist leadership that\nis not weak, fragmented and waiting for Mr. Deng's passing or its\nown demise. The communist\nregime indeed faces daunting\nproblems of transforming China's economic system and governing a rapidly changing society. China will\nnot see a decline such as the Soviet\nUnion has experienced, but is\nmore likely to thrive and prosper\nbecoming one of the world's leading economic powers. The\nCommunist Party is going to\nbecome the sole party in a one-party state, where economic freedom will be universal and political\nfreedom non-existent.\nAITA\nAcross\n7.

    "content": "The Great and Silent Debate\nDiscussion\nOwain Bennallack explores UGM's and Unions.\nLast. Friday saw the first UGM of term and the\nnew constitution receive its first reading. It was\npassed. UGM stands for 'Union General\nMeeting': it is the forum which aims to bring\ntogether all the Union's members to determine\npolicy and to vote on both mundane and\ncontentious issues. At present every student in\ncollege is a Union member so the total number\nin attendance could theoretically have\nnumbered several thousand.\nAround thirty people were present.\nThere are many ways in which to\ncontinue with this article. The first would be to\nscream 'apathetic herds' at. Imperial students\nin general. The second would be to blame the\nsabbaticals for mismanagement and the low\nattendance. Another would be to simply shrug\nwearily and say \"well, that is the way of things\nnowadays\". (After all, are students really\napathetic, or would it not be truer to say they\nare simply not interested in UGM's?) All these\napproaches have been taken in the past by the\nUnion, this newspaper and a host of taxi\ndrivers \u2014 all have an element of validity. But to\nblame any particular body seems facile, given\nthe long history of this saga.\nInstead, I'd like to consider some of the\nroot factors involved in the debate. Given the\nlow attendance, it can no longer be assumed\nthat people know, or even care, what the\nUnion stands for and what exactly their\nrelationship is with it.\nWhat is the Union?\nThe word 'Union' is an umbrella term\ndenoting the student run organisation\nof Imperial College. Although funded\nby college it is the students who\ndecide how the funds are spent.\nBroadly, the Union is responsible for\nWelfare, Representation and\npromoting and encouraging the\ninterests of students in extra-curricular\nactivities (ie. All the clubs and\nsocieties at Imperial). Further to these\naims ICU also runs refectories (e.g. 'Da Vinci's bar'), the Union bookstore\nand employs permanent members of\nstaff to manage some of the day-to-day running of this large operation.\nSo what does that mean? It means, in\neffect, that if your buy anything from the\nbookstore, if you belong to any club, if you\nhave any academic problems that need\naddressing or any welfare issues, if you\nattended a Freshers' Week event, whatever,\nyou have interacted with the Union. There are\npeople who drink every night in the traditional\nl if FELIX2 I0CT94 bar, perhaps play rugby or football for three\nyears and abscond with first years annually at\nthe first Ents night of the term but confidently\nleave college secure in the knowledge that they\nhave had nothing to do with the Union.\n\"Union? Bunch of hacks, never did anything\nfor me...\" they will confidently say at the\n(Union organised) commemoration ball.\nAll this is not meant as a piece of Union\npropaganda but, to highlight that, you are likely\nto be affected by the Union in some way whilst\nat 1C, aldi ough obviously to varying degrees.\nIt is not. true, then, to say that people\nhave 'no interest, in the Union'. In fact, it is\nrather that die y have no interest in its running\n(the 'politics' for want of a misleading word)-.\nWhy should you care about the\nrunning of the Union?\nBy taking an interest, in even a small\nway, students at least make the Union\nfeel accountable for its actions. This\nensures that students basic needs are\nalways kept as a priority.\nIn addition, by being involved you can\nmake a positive contribution to\nstudent life. Your involvement could\nlead to anything from better\nentertainments to better staff-student\nrelations. Everywhere the Union has a hand you can stick your own finger.\nMoney is being drawn in your name\ntoo. You should know how it's spent.\nBut there are still many students in\ncollege who know all this, who are involved in\nclubs at a senior level and have even sat on\nUnion committees but who consist end y do not\nattend UGM's. Given that they are so\nnumerous, and that the sheer number of those\nwho do not attend is so large, perhaps it could\nbe that the majority is right. Mob rule.\nWhy should you NOT care about\nthe running of the Union?\nFirstly you could say that your\ninterests are being met and so why\nchange things? Your club has its\nmoney, your bar its beer. You may\nfeel that there are other, more\ncommitted people able to represent\nyour point of view already. Or that\nyou have time to play hockey or watch\nbands, but you haven't time to take\npart in the finer points of 'hack y' policy wrangling. Fair enough.\nWhich brings us back to the beginning.\nCouncil votes to make itself supreme body\nFarewell to democracy? ISSUE 82*5\" \" I27 \"JMTI989\nWhat the poor turnout at. the UGM on Friday\nco tdd mean is that the new constitution is\ncompletely well-founded. After all, if no-one is\nattending UGM's then democracy isn't functioning and the semi-democratic council\nproposed in the new constitution (see FELIX1006 for a brief explanation together with\narguments for and against.) could be the only\nway forward. Last Friday the attendance at\ndie UGM was to degree made up of the would\nbe members of the new council (A bewildered\nfirst year was even asked to stand as first year\nrepresentative!)\nMaybe it. is too much to expect the\nstudent body to turn up to form a quo rate UGM and vote itself out of existence. If the\nbattle lines were more clearly drawn and there\nwas a real body of opinion against the new\nconstitution then maybe attendance would be\nhigher. For instance, the old FELIX front\npage above is taken from January 1989 (only\nfive years ago) and it reports on a motion quite\nsimilar to the new constitution: to remove\nUGM's as the supreme decision-making body.\nThe result? 214 in favour and 364 against.\nOver six hundred people attended.\nIn an interview Lucy Chothia, Union\nPresident, admitted that last, Friday's turnout\nwas 'very disappointing' and said that there\nwas a plan to get publicity out earlier next\ntime. But she believes low attendance reflects\nmore generally on student disinterest in the\nUGM system. Asked whether she should be\nactively going out into public forums such as\nthe JCR and talking to students she said:\n\"We'd love to go out into the JCR but if we did\nthe Union would not run. I believe the most\nimportant thing is for the, Union to function\nrather than for people to know that we are\nhere and that we are great.\"\nThe next UGM, in two weeks time, will\nseek lo ratify the new constitution. Copies are\nstill available,fi vm the Union office.\n\n"

Via\nthe internet, an international network of computers, the invader\nwas able to disrupt, Finland's main University computer net-work. It was only once Finnish\nauthorities rang Imperial that the\nproblem was chased and solved.\nThe computer, located in the\nDepartment of Biochemistry, was\nbroken into permitting the hacker\nto become a 'superuser'. As 'superuser' the hacker could bypass all\nsecurity mechanisms on the\nmachine. \"They could tell it to\nblow it's own mind away,\" said\nSean Bennett of the Department\nof Computing. \"This fault is one\nthat is used time and time again\nby hackers to mess with the inter-net.\" (Continues on page 3)\nANDREW DORMAN-SMITH\nSenior academics at. the.\nDepartment, of Mineral Resources\nEngineering (MRE) have called\nfor further discussions over a plan\nto rename the department. Earth\nResources Engineering has\nemerged as the favourite choice\nfor a new name, after discussions\nbetween college officials.\nThe change has been mooted\nfollowing a letter from the\nProfessor John Archer, ProRector, which asks for comments\non the new title. Professor Archer,\nsaid that he has received only one\nnegative response to his letter,\nand claimed that most of the\ndepartment's staff agree with the\nproposal. But Professor Archer\nsaid discussions are continuing -despite the publication of an official college note which says the\nchange will take place \"shortly\".\nProfessor Archer defended\nthe plans to change the name of\nMRE, insisting that the change\nwould improve the image of the\ndepartment, and 'incorporate a philosophical redefinition' to\nreflect the 'flagship courses' the\ndepartment has been running for\ntwo years.\nOne of the Department's staff, Professor Shaw, Dean of the\nRSM, pointed out that the proposal has not. been adequately\ndiscussed with students. He suggested that the issue should be\ndebated by the Staff-Student\ncommittee. It was emphasised\nthat most of the staff were away\nwhen Professor Archer's letter\nwas issued, and that although a change had been discussed the\nbenefits of the proposal had not.\nbeen adequately debated.\nProfessor Shaw said the name of\nthe Department itself does not\noverly matter, and said he was,\n\"a believer in tradition\". Professor\nShaw would not say if he supported the name change proposal.\nHowever, the new head of\nMRE, and Dean of the newly\nestablished Graduate School of\nthe Environment, Professor\nWoods, is believed to think the\nproposal is a 'great idea'. His role\nas Dean will be to coordinate the\ndepartments of Imperial, and to\npresent the benefits for research\nof the college in line with a review\ncompleted in May by Sir John\nMason.\nThe other two RSM departments may also change names.\nThe college's chief decision making body, the Management\nPlanning Group (MPG), has suggested a change in name for the\nGeology department. The MPG\nhas not. specified a name but\nEarth Sciences seems to be the\nmost likely name, though\nGeological Sciences has also been\nsuggested.\nA decision on this has not yet\nbeen made, and the proposal\nwould officially be discussed at\nthe next. Staff meeting. Professor\nWorthington, Head of the\nDepartment, of Geology, said\nthere was a general feeling that\nthe Department's name is a bit\noutdated, but insisted that if there\nis disagreement he has no intention of forcing the proposal. If\napproved, any change would be\nmade on the same time scale as\nthat for MRE, taking effect from\n(Continues on page 3)\nQ news one&two&three \u2022 editorial&credits three \u2022 discuss iom constitution four \u2022 the\ns files ric women special seven \u2022 incoming nine \u2022 GodMachineinterview eleven \u2022\nfeature:ic library special twelve&thirteen \u2022 clued up fifteen \u2022 club&societies seventeen \u2022\nstandby twenty&twenty one \u2022 seven day guide twenty two& twenty three \u2022 sports twenty four B "

    "content": "News and Editorial\n(Ubercackcrfrom page 1)\nThe hacker managed to shutdown part of the Finnish equivalent of Britain's JANct system by\nstopping all e mail reaching it. It\ncaused the Finnish network to\ndisappear off of the computer\nmap and is known by computer\nexperts as, 'a major denial of service attack'. The problem was\ntraced by a Finnish user who\nreported this breach of security. A high level Finnish authority then\ncontacted Imperial College to ask\nwhat, was going on. It is claimed\nby Professor Hynds, Mead of the\nCCS, that the CCS have, \"man-aged to make sure that nothing\nlike that, will happen again.\"\nHowever, when asked about\nwhether improvements had been\nmade, Mr Bennet replied: \"None\nwhat so ever as far as I am con-cern ed, no actions have been\ntaken.\" Currently the present, system is vulnerable to anyone who\nhas a workstation on the internet\nand knows the name of the local\nnetwork.\nThe experienced hacker,\nknown in computer circles as an\n'Ubercracker', 'nuked' the system\nwhich means that they sent packets of information to a machine\non the network. The machine at\nthe receiving end in Finland, acting as a nucleus for the university\nnetwork, contained a bug that\ncan be manipulated to make the\nmachine stop 'talking' to die net-work.\nCurrently all of the college's Unix based computers, except,\nthose maintained by the\nDepartment of Computing are\nrunning a system that, is extremely easy to break into. The\nDepartment of Computing uses a system called Kerberos di at is far\nmore difficult to break into. It is\nnot completely safe but. anyone\nwishing to break into a 'Kerberosed' system would need a long time to do it. and know\nexactly what they were doing. It\nimproves security by providing\nextra protection on passwords\nthat move around the various systems. \"Basically, it makes things\nmany times more secure than it\ncurrently is, and the College\nought, to be using Kerberos now,\"\nsaid Bill Sharp, computing sup-port, at St, Mary's.( RSM Namesfrom page 1)\nOctober 1995, it would show that\nthe department wants to be\ninvolved in the new Graduate\nSchool.\nProfessor Worthington said\nthe change would only be of\n'marginal help' in the Research\nAssessment Exercise which the\ndepartment will undergo next\nyear in its bid to get a Grade 5\nrating, this would give the department more research money. The\nrating is seen as being vital to the\nfinancial well being of the depart-ment. Prof Worthington admitted\nthat they were still not balancing\ntheir accounts, but with new lec-CciitoriaL\nAt (he Mind's Edge\nMy brother recently bad a motor\ncycle accident, which left, him with\npins in his shoulder, left leg and\nright foot and, in addition, some\nvery strange dreams. We were discussing general anaesthetics and I, a veteran of two operations, mentioned that the last, time I had one\nI was looking into the assistant's beautiful blue eyes as she counted\ndown (1 giddy with gas and a mild\ninfatuation) and I wondered why\nshe stopped at 'seven'. \"The operation is over,\" she replied and I spent a lazy narcotic afternoon\npuncturing the hours with brief\nislands of consciousness. My\nbrother, however, seems to have\nsuffered rather badly. He speaks\nof hallucinations and tortured\nnights.\n\"I was in this woods, talking\nto a strange monk in an iron\nmask. I lay there for hours and it\nwas only the hospital bed that\ngave it away: that I was dream-ing.\" Aid: \"there was this spaceman next to my bed all night. I kept screaming at him to go away\nbut he just sat there. All night...\"\nAnd, slightly comically I confess,\nhe spent the Friday after the third\noperation fervent in the belief that,\nhe was an 'aircraft door'. He told\nme, quite genuinely, that, he was\nsurprised to be in hospital with all\nthese other doors \u2014 since when did\ndoors go to hospital? And why\nwould a nurse call a door by its\nNews In Brief\nBY PETER LANIGAN, IAN DAVEY AND RACHEL WALTERS\nUnion Disciplinary\nTwo students have been banned\nfrom the Union Building after a disturbance during Fresher's Week.\nThe incident occurred inside\nthe Union Building on the night, of\nthe casino and the hypnotism\nshow. It resulted in the involve-ment, of security and Union\nStewards.\nThe students, undergraduates\nin the Departments of\nMathematics and Mineral\nResources Engineering, appeared\nbefore a disciplinary committee\nshortly after the incident.\nDan Look, Deputy Union\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nsaid that the matter was being\ntreated as personal and would not\nreveal any names. He declined to\ncomment further. It is believed\nthat the students had been drinking heavily, and that the incident\nhappened towards the end of the\nevening.\nWomen's Problems\nIn a new initiative for the female\npopulation of Imperial College,\nsecurity's women staff have\nundergone training by the\nMetropolitan Police in dealing\nwith victims of sexual harassment,\nand assault. Women make up\n10% of the staff, which will enable\nat least two to be on duty at each\nshift.\nture ships and the additional\n\u00a3200,000 per year that a Grade 5\nrating automatically generates, it\nwould make a balanced budget\npossible.\nIn the case of Materials, the\nthird department of the RSM,\ndiscussions are taking place for a name which would better reflect\nits activities. Professor Maclean,\nthe head of Materials, has insisted\nthat a change is not imminent,\nand would be for 'marketing's sake' rather than to reflect any\nphilosophical change. He\nemphasised that undergraduate\ncourses would continue, and\npointed out that his is the biggest\nMaterials department in the\ncountry. \"Rumours of our death\nare greatly exaggerated,\" he\njoked, insisting that Materials will\ncontinue to exist, as a separate\ndepartment.\nCredits\nEditor\nPrinter\nBusiness Manager\nAdvertising Manager\nEditorial Team\nOwain Bennallack\nAndy Thompson\nTim Bavister\nHelen Randall\nMusic\nNews\nPhotography\nS Flles\nVik Bansal\nDeclan Curry & Andrew Tseng\nIvan Chan & Diana Harrison\nTim Parsons\nArt & Literature\nCinema\nClubs, Societies & Union\nColumns\nFeatures\nJon Jordan\nWei Lee\nPiers Doniell\nMarcus Alexander\nKate Cox\nSeven Day Guide Wei Lee & Ivan Chan\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week\nJon Jordan, Andrew Tseng & Helen Randall\nHelpfulness Steven Newhouse\nfirst name?\nWhat, lies behind the brain,\nbeneath those neurone s and deep\nin the heart of nothingness or\nsoul?

Six women from across the undergraduate spectrum gave tes-timon y: Michelle Cole and Barbara Wensing from Biology II, Sam Nagaitis from Chemistry I, Cathy Harris from Computing I, Heather Turner from Civ.Eng.Ill, and Sarah White, Geology\nwith Engineering Geology III. How do undergrad female techs feel about Imperial? Is it stale and\nsexist or switched on and sexy? Decide for yourself.

It, was the only thing\nI really ever wanted to do. My\noutlook on science in general is\nthat there are a lot of boring people in it. I think they can't show\ntheir real selves for some reason.\n\u2022 SH Barbara: I think science is\niHI really interesting. If someone\ncame up to me and said science is\ndull and uninteresting, I would\nbeat them up! Some people think\nscience, is ...really really difficult,\nbut I don't think so.\nISam: I just do what I find\neasy...I think, yea, I'd like to\nbe a scientist, wearing a white coat,\nin a lab, finding cures and things.\nCathy: I wanted to be doing\nsomething hi-tech. Industry\nseemed unexciting and u nap/ WL\npealing, whereas computers M are the future...\ni Heather: I did some\n' that in Biology, everything's okay, but occasionally...the male\nlecturers will look on you as complete and utter bimbos, some-times, especially in practicals,\nwhere its easy, not to make a mis-take, but for things to go wrong.\nS Cathy: They seem to be\nmaking a conscious effort,\nalthough sometimes they take\nthings too far. 10 for effort.\nBHeather: On the whole,\nthey ve treated us exactly\nthe same as the boys. I'd give\nthem 8 or 9 for trying.\nSarah: Its not. that the RSM\nWMm is anti-female, as much as its\npro-male. There's almost, a macho\nCivil Engineering work\nexperience at school. People\nseemed to enjoy what they\nwere doing, and it seemed\ninteresting.\nEm Sarah: I always knew\nSi would be doing Science\nMy dad's an engineer. I'm not sure\nif I'm going to stay in science,\nthough. I have to decide whether\nI'm going to stick with it. or pursue\na musical career instead...\nAre male students sexist?\nMichelle: When I first start-ed, I thought the boys were\nlooking at me, but now I think I was just being over-sensitive.\n\u2022 SB! Barbara: Biology seems\nmi okay, but I think its different in engineering. I think you'd be more in the spotlight. I 've never\nexperienced sexism in the college,\nbut I think there must be some. I think its not so much that people\nare sexist, as that people want to\nshow others how smart they are.\nSam: I'm used to being one\ngirl in a crowd of boys. I guess guys are sexist. They do try\nto wind me up, but I don't let it\neffect me, really.\nBH Cathy: They give us a lot. of\nattention because obviously\nthere are so few of us - maybe too\nmuch attention sometimes. They\ndon't have any real respect, for us,\n.e.g. my swipe card didn't work\ninitially. These guys had to grab it\nand try it for themselves before\nthey would believe me. Most of\nthe girls I meet are feeling the\nsame way and feel we should\nyou know put out a united\nfront and face the sexist guys.\n[rm Sarah: When I first came\nEH to the RSM, I was very\nintimidated by all the guys in\nthe class, most, of whom were\nrugby, beer-drinking types. I guess we've learnt not to take\nmuch rubbish from anyone any-more.
