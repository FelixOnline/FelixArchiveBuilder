In reality, Prof Nutt ar-gues, much of the time harms are\nlittle considered and moral reasons\nare provided for the classi\ufb01cation of\ndrugs instead. His book does not attempt to convince people that taking\ndrugs is a fun thing to do (something\nthat was misunderstood by a lot of\nthe critics of Channel 4\u2019s live ecstasy\ntrial). Instead, Prof Nutt argues for a\ndrugs policy that is based on evidence\nand that indicates the harm posed by\neach drug. He also argues that the current \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d, while being set\nup in good intentions, has had many\nnegative e\ufb00ects: the criminalisation of\nyoung people; the lack of proper care\nfor drug addicts; and the lack of fund-Sex, drugs and Professor David Nutt\nAndy Roast Writer\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n22\nIt turned out that 52% of the audience\nat a recent event at the Dana Centre\nwould prefer to be executed by lethal\ninjection than hanging, electrocution\nor being shot. This was before they\nwere given information about what\nexactly occurs when a lethal injection\nis carried out.\nA member of the audience was selected to lie on a death bed with a plastic arm to demonstrate venous can-nulation. Tim Crocker-Buque, Junior\nDoctor and Public health researcher\nchaired the evening and then showed\nhow the lethal cocktail is adminis-tered.\nFelicity Plaat, consultant anaesthetist with the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust described the drugs\nused in the procedure. She then explained the huge problems when injections are being administered by\nprison wardens, who are not medically trained, causing undue su\ufb00ering\nto dying prisoners.\nIt is di\ufb03cult to judge the speci\ufb01c\namount of anaesthetic which is need-ed, and sometimes prisoners wake up\nduring their execution. As they are\ninjected with enough drug to paralyse their striated muscles for a week,\nthey have no way of indicating their\nconsciousness. Finally, a high dose of\npotassium decelerates heart palpitations until it completely stops and the\nprisoner dies. However if the cannu-lation is not completely in a vein, potassium leak-out can induce death of\nsurrounding tissue which is terribly\npainful.\nDespite the fact that these drugs\ncome from medical application, it was\nsurprising to \ufb01nd out from Vivienne\nNathanson, Director of Professional\nActivities at the British Medical Association, that doctors must not take\npart in administering lethal injections\nbecause it is an abuse of their medical\nknowledge. However, they are able to\ncon\ufb01rm death and can even prescribe\nthe deadly drugs to prisons.\nMany US prisons are having dif\ufb01culty in carrying out executions as\nthey have depleted their drug supply\nand cannot source new supplies, as\ntcetoday.com\nAn intelligent discussion on the\nharms of legal and illegal drugs\nUntil the recent \u201cEcstasy Live\u201d TV\nshow, Professor David Nutt was\nbest known as \u201cthe scientist who got\nsacked\u201d. After giving a lecture that\ndiscussed the harms of cannabis, Prof\nNutt was asked (by the then Home\nSecretary, Alan Johnson) to resign as\nChair of the Advisory Council on the\nMisuse of Drugs (ACMD). The irony,\nas discussed in Drugs Without The Hot\nAir was that Prof Nutt was sacked for\nadvising the government on policy,\nwhich as he understood was the purpose of the ACMD.\nProf Nutt\u2019s book explores new\nmethods for reducing the harm of legal and illegal drugs. This starts with\na critique of the current classi\ufb01cation system for drugs. This system\ning into therapies for people living\nwith mental-health disorders, such a\ndepression and schizophrenia.\nHis book contains a broad, varied\nand detailed discussion of the e\ufb00ects,\nhistories and harms of legal and illegal\ndrugs. I found the chapters on the histories of cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine\nparticularly interesting as they show\nthat, all too often, the legal status of\na drug is decided not by using scienti\ufb01c evidence, but also through moral,\npolitical and corporate ideologies. I\nhave recommended this book to a lot\nof my friends as it\u2019s an intelligent discussion of drugs policy is rarely found\nwithin other media. Equally, the hopeful way Prof Nutt writes leads me to\nbelieve that our politicians will, quite\nsoon, invoke a truly evidence-based\napproach to drug policy.\nkalwnews.org\nwas presented by Maya Fao, head of\nthe Stop the Lethal Injection Project\nat Reprieve UK. Each time the prisons\ntry to buy drugs, the non-pro\ufb01t organisation tries to block this by writing to\nthe suppliers and governments a\ufb00ected. So far they have been successful.\nEuropean countries ban these exports\nand many pharmaceutical companies\nare unwilling to tarnish their reputation for money from executioners. Recently, the US government tried concocting the lethal cocktail themselves,\nbut this did not produce a successful\nexecution.\nAs a result, only 24% of the Dana\nCentre audience decided that they\nwould prefer to be executed by lethal\ninjection.\nExecuting Justice at the Dana Centre\nLily Le Writer\n\u201c\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nde\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\nea\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\nat\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt\nth\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\nh\u201d\nAccidental\npotassium\nleak-out can\ninduce an\nagonizingly\npainful\nA new, cheap method of detecting\nultralow concentrations of HIV and\nsome cancers through a colour changing solution, visible to the human eye,\nhas been developed by biomedical engineers at Imperial College.\nThe test relies on a solution that\nchanges colour depending on whether\nor not the biomarker, an indicator of\nthe disease, is present \u2014 red for nega-tive, blue for positive. The solution\nwas able to detect concentrations of\nboth HIV biomarker p24 and prostate-speci\ufb01c antigen, a biomarker for\nprostate cancer, at ultralow concentration of 1 \u00d7 10-18\ng ml-1\n, far lower\nthan the concentrations detectable via\ncurrent gold-standard tests.\nThe solution uses gold nanoparticles\nas a method of detection. If the bio-marker is present the gold nanoparticles aggregate into irregular clumps,\nproducing a blue-tone, i.e. a positive\nresult. If the biomarker isn\u2019t present\nthe nanoparticles form spherical, non-aggregated structures that produce a\nred tone, i.e. a negative result.

As a result many countries cannot a\ufb00ord to have a reliable\nsystem of testing; the colour change\nsolution test is predicted to be around\nten times cheaper than current meth-ods. As quoted by Dr Roberto de la\nRica, one of the principal research-ers: \u201cThis test could be signi\ufb01cantly\ncheaper to administer, which could\npave the way for more widespread use\nof HIV testing in poorer parts of the\nworld.\u201d\nThe research team are now looking\ntowards not-for-pro\ufb01t global health\norganizations for additional funding,\nand help to bring the test from the lab\nand into the nations that need it the\nmost.\nDOI: doi:10.1038/nnano.2012.186v\n\n"

Okay, I\u2019ll\nget off at Westminster and\nchange, that will\nbe quick right?\u201d. That was what was\ngoing through my head as I frantically scrambled to make it to my interview with Brett Wigdortz. Turns\nout I was wrong by the way (about\nthe trains being delayed, not having\nthe interview: this would be a very\nshort Feature if that were to have\nbeen the case).\nHaving chosen probably the\nweirdest way possible to get to London Bridge, thinking that it would\nbe \u201cfaster\u201d, I sat on the tube. I was\ndoing that thing where you nervously play music (to no avail, as\nwhen you\u2019re in a rush you can never\nactually hear or enjoy any songs)\nand fidget in the chair, willing the\ntube driver to choose today to attempt to break some kind of World\nRecord for \u201cspeediest delivery of\nlate man to interview\u201d. The driver\nwasn\u2019t in any way trying to become\na World Record Holder. I guess\nsome just don\u2019t have the hero genes\nin them. Arsehole.\nHaving run out of London Bridge,\nwith a James Bond theme on my iPhone (name dropping both, terri-ble, I know, but this is 100% true), I\npromptly grabbed what all students\nrefer to as their one and only sav-iour, i.e. Google Maps (thank God I\nhaven\u2019t upgraded phones and don\u2019t\nhave Apple Maps, I would have never arrived). I then managed to get\nturned around and walked in the\ncomplete and utter wrong direction.\nA fact that didn\u2019t register with me\nuntil I\u2019d walked a little bit too far.\nLuckily, sort of, my phone was\nringing, so I had to look at my\nscreen and realise what I had done.\nUnluckily, it was TeachFirst calling\nto see where I was and note that I\nwas late for the interview. A quick\nbit of apologising, and some less\nthan dignified walk/jogging later\n\u2013 you know what I mean; it\u2019s that\nthing you do where you jog a few\nmetres, walk a few, jog a few, walk\na few, and so on \u2013 I was on track.\nFinally, I arrived at TeachFirst\u2019s\nshiny, swish office in London. Well,\nthere was an incident involving me\nand not being able to find the en-trance, but that was uneventful/em-barrassing so I won\u2019t go into it.\nVery graciously, Brett has decided\nto give me his time. I feel terrible\nfor being late and hoped it wasn\u2019t\ntoo much of a bother. I walking into\nthe office and sat down in a modern\nconference room (I even got free\nwater).\nBrett casually walks in and greets\nme, with a coffee in a Thermos flask\nin his hand. He seems laid back and\nthat puts me at ease.\nThis first thing that strikes me is\nthat he is American. I don\u2019t know\nwhy this was a surprise, given his\nname, but for some reason I expected him to be English because of\nTeachFirst being UK. Well, that was\ngoing to be mistake two. \u201cOne of\nour alumni is opening up a TeachFirst in Australia\u201d Brett tells me. It\nturns out it\u2019s going global in only\nten years since it\u2019s founding.\nBrett\u2019s mother was a teacher, so\nperhaps teaching has always been\nin his blood. He tells me of how he\nstill \u201cvisits the schools that we are\nworking with\u201d.\nBrett tells me about how inspiring it is to see the children doing\nso well, and how statistics show\nthat great teachers do make a dif-ference. That seems to be his vision,\nthat students want to go into teach-ing. He doesn\u2019t want it to stop just\nthere though. Brett explains how\nhe wants \u201cthe graduates to become\nambassadors\u201d. TeachFirst, in his\nmind, leads students to being interested in education for life, and not\njust for however long they are at the\ncompany and on the scheme. Brett\nwants the TeachFirst graduates to\nbe governors of schools, or even tutors in their spare time. He says he\ndoesn\u2019t mind if someone does the\nTeachFirst plan and then goes off to\nwork for a consultancy, as long as\nthey keep being involved in educating young people.\nHe believes firmly that \u201cyou can\nnot give up on people and forget\nabout those who are older\u201d. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to just target those at a\nyounger age and leave a generation\nof children behind, he wants to be\nable to get everyone from disadvantaged backgrounds into having better prospects for the future. He also\ntalks about how there is a shortage\nof highly qualified teachers in the\nSTEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine) subjects in\nschools, particularly lower achieving schools with pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nI move the interview on to more of\nthe entrepreneurship side of TeachFirst to get what \u201cbuzzwords\u201d he\nwould say are the most important.\nA charity that has grown so quickly\nis definitely, without a shadow of a\ndoubt, an impressive feat. Now being the third highest recruiter in the\nUK, I wondered what he thought\nyou needed. Perseverance and hard\nwork are big points that he flags up\nas being important for any budding\nentrepreneurs.\nThe interview wraps up and I\nrealise that I\u2019ve also slightly overrun the allotted time. Brett doesn\u2019t\nseem to mind too much. I\u2019m then\ntaken around the plush offices. It\u2019s\nall new, but still manages to retain\nsome character: sometimes brand\nnew offices can really be soulless,\nbut they\u2019ve managed to bring a human touch to it. There\u2019s even an assessment centre going on, and the\nman on the door was on the TeachFirst scheme and now works there.\nAll of the staff there genuinely\nseemed very engaged and enthusiastic about the general ethos of the\ncompany.\nBrett Wigdortz\u2019s book \u2018Success\nAgainst The Odds\u2019 packed with\nstart-up tips and business advice is\navailable to buy now.\nIf you would like to find out more\nabout Teach First, sign up to the\nTeach First Employer Presentation on Wednesday 14th November\nat 6pm in Read Theatre, Sherfield\nBuilding via JobsLive.\nU\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n10\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nFee\u2019ding well?\nAnother week and another late night.\nAlso, of course, another hasty and\nfrantic sprint to the finish.\nThis week, we looked into all of the\nfees charged to international students\nby the Russell Group. What we found\nwas that Imperial was significantly\nhigher than the average, and that in\nmost cases we were the highest. Only\nOxford tipped us off the top spot for\nsome categories (however, if you take\nthe cost of living into account it is\nonce again Imperial that is on top).\nWhy are the fees so high? There are\nthe understandable points about the\nfact that we are in London and that we\nare a purely science university, which\nmeans each student takes more money to train. Although the London point\nis lessened by UCL, Kings, et al (I feel\nlike I\u2019m referencing again) being much\nlower than us. Even taking into account those points, some of the fees\nseem just way too high.\nMedicine is the highest, at \u00a340,000\na year. A year! Ouch, that hurts. Here\nis the question though: for what?\nThey get exactly the same lecturers,\nfirms, and so forth, as the home stu-dents, so why are they charged so\nmuch more? Possibly it\u2019s to subsidise\nthe home students, but is it okay that\nthat\u2019s happening? Or is there a cheeky\nlittle extra bonus of Imperial chucked\nin there?\nWhy are people willing to pay the\nfees? Well, one word: prestige. It\u2019s a\ngood degree, so therefore is a good\n\u201cinvestment\u201d, but degrees shouldn\u2019t\nbe purely an investment, and fees\nshouldn\u2019t be charged based purely on\nthat.\nI\u2019m worried that they are essentially\npricing out a lot of people from applying to Imperial. Yes, as an international\nstudent, you would have to pay higher\nfees anyway. So you could argue\nthat some international students are\npriced out from the off, but you should\naim to let as many people as possible\nbe able to apply (ideally all, but that\u2019s\nnot going to happen). Then you can\npick the best, not the richest.\nAnother point is that it really isn\u2019t\nfair to international students to use\nthe fact that they are willing to pay\nsuch high fees as an excuse to just\npick a high figure and charge away.\nUnfortunately, systems are systems:\nnow, everything is set in place, and so\nmoney is going to be allocated with\nan expected income. This means it\u2019s\nlikely that fees will only rise. That\u2019s a\ndepressing thought.\nAre international students willing to\npay that much for the Imperial degree?\nWell, yes, they are if they are here.\nHowever, just because you can do\nsomething doesn\u2019t mean you should.\nAllow me to make a rushed analogy:\nI could, perhaps, if I were more co-or-dinated and had bigger pockets in my\ncoat, steal a chocolate bar from the Library. I choose not to (JCR has a wider\nselection... I really hope no-one looks\nat the CCTV images \u2013 joking, obvi-ously) because I deem it to be wrong.\nPOLITICS SCIENCE GAMES\nLetter from USA Professor Nutt Halo 4 and more\nWe\u2019ve gone hard on the US\nElection.

So it was perhaps unsurprising that I was met with\nquizzical looks when I announced\nthat I was o\ufb00 to The Netherlands to\ngo Wadlopen. Wadlopen, the art of\nwalking on mud\ufb02ats exposed at low\ntide by the Wadden Sea, was something that until recently I had never\neven heard of, let alone considered\ndoing. When I read about it in my\nguide book, however, I was very keen\nto try this unusual activity.\nWebsites and locals warn against\nattempting this niche sport without\na guide. Not only is it important to\nminimise ecological disturbance, but\nthe tide can turn quickly, leaving you\nstranded out at sea. However, since\nthe local guided tour costs a hefty\nforty Euros and included the dubious\npleasure of spending three hours in a\n\ufb01shing boat, the \ufb01ve of us decided to\ngo it alone. How hard could it be?\nStaying in the vibrant university\ncity of Groningen (which, incidental-ly, boasts a truly excellent children\u2019s\nplay ground), we found that our nearest entrance to the Wadden Sea was\ndue north, near Usquert. On arrival,\nhowever, although we could see the\nsea (indeed tantalisingly close), there\nwere many muddy \ufb01elds between it\nand us, hampering our advance. Not\nto be deterred, we took o\ufb00 our shoes\nand started our Wadlopen there and\nthen. But within two hours we had\nmoved a total displacement of 20\nmetres; the tar-like mud was deep\nand treacherous, and getting stuck\nin it was an all-too-likely possibility.\nWhen we happened upon a single\nshoe abandoned in the mud, we realised that our e\ufb00orts were futile and\nthat we would never even reach the\nsea. Exhausted and humbled by na-ture, we turned back to \ufb01rm land.\nFor those defeated by, or uninterested in, mud, the North thankfully\nhas lots more to o\ufb00er, primarily beautiful windmills, castles, and a rare\nstar-shaped fort at Bourtange: our\ntrip was by no means a disappoint-ment.\nWould I advise you to try Wadlopen\nyourself? De\ufb01nitely. It is an opportunity to try an extraordinary sport\nin some beautiful scenery far away\nfrom the tourist trail. Pack warm old\nclothes which you don\u2019t mind getting muddy. And above all, be sure to\nbring a good book for the three hours\u2019\nride in the \ufb01shing boat.\nI\nTRAVEL\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n20\nTravel Editors: Simon\nCarnochan, Veronika\nMcQuade\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHey there horses, how you doin\u2019?\nYeah, mud party!\nEverybody dance real slow...\nI know it looks like mud but I\npromise it tastes just like chocolate.\n\n"

The view of\nLondon from such a height is incred-ible, and on a clear sunny day there is\nmore than just a pang of jealousy as\nAmanda Brumpton welcomes me into\nher glass o\ufb03ce.\nHaving \ufb01nished University in the\n80s, Amanda began her career at\nGuardian Royal Exchange following a\nsummer internship with the insurance\ncompany in the actuarial department,\nbefore leaving for the Social Services.\n\u201cBig organisations are never boring,\nbecause there\u2019s always something different you could be doing,\u201d Amanda\nstates.\nAmanda\u2019s career history also includes an impressive 10 years running\nlarge outsourcing accounts for IBM,\nand a brief stint at Japanese ICT company Fujitsu.\nToday, Amanda is at the world leading IT company CSC where manages\nthe operations of the company\u2019s sales\ndepartment based on a model she created from scratch.\n\u201cI\u2019m good at realigning businesses\nthat are not performing, and transforming business from one state to\nanother. A lot people can strategize\nand create a plan, but it\u2019s a di\ufb00erent\nskill set to be able to take that plan and\nexecute it. I\u2019m all about execution.\u201d\n\u201cI probably work at least 10-12 hours\na day, 5 days a week, full on. Everyday\nis di\ufb00erent, there\u2019s some common\nthemes: choosing which business opportunities to go after, helping my\nteam shape the conversations they\nhave with clients and meeting clients\nthemselves to talk about their businesses.\u201d\nYet despite such success, Amanda\nadmits that she didn\u2019t even know what\nsales was at university. \u201cSelling is just a\nconversation with purpose. If you appear to be a brash shiny sales person,\npeople back o\ufb00. So actually, the art of\nselling is for people to not think it\u2019s a\nsales conversation, but rather a business conversation about them and\ntheir issues.\u201d\nChanges in Technology\nOn the topic of issues, I question\nAmanda on how recent developments\nin the global markets both in terms of\n\ufb01nancial turmoil and improvements\nin technology are a\ufb00ecting her role.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of changes over\nthe last 15 to 20 years, but the pace of\nchange is speeding up exponentially.\nWhat\u2019s happening is that the way\nyou get IT services at home is tripping\nover into what we call the \u201centerprise\nspace\u201d of big companies, something\nwe call \u201cconsumerisation\u201d. The challenge now is keeping things secure\nand complying with regulations in order to protect people\u2019s data and client\ninformation.\nThis has caused a big change in the\nway companies operate their services,\nbut it also o\ufb00ers a huge opportunity\nfor them to become more \ufb02exible in\nhow they deliver front line services\nand internal operations to their cus-tomers.\nOur job is to help our customers understand how they can get maximum\nvalue out of these opportunities whilst\nstill delivering all of their obligations\nfrom a regulatory perspective.\u201d\nBeing \u201csuperwoman\u201d\nHaving covered how the company\ndeals with its challenges, we turn to\ntalk about how Amanda deals with the\nchallenges in her personal life.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is how to balance being a working mum and wife\nwith the demands of the job, and try\nand be successful at it all.\nAs women, we have the natural tendency to want to be the best at eve-rything; we want to be the best mum,\nbest wife, and the best in our jobs, so\nwe push ourselves really hard to be\n\u201csuperwoman\u201d and it just isn\u2019t possible\nto do everything.\u201d\n\u201cThere are some stereotypes that\nmake the bar really high about what\nis perceived as the right thing. I think\nthe biggest challenge is learning to be\ncontent with the choices you\u2019ve made,\nto forgive yourself for the fact that\nyou\u2019ve got to make compromises, and\nnot carry this burden of guilt around\ntrying to be superwoman, because\nfrankly, you\u2019ll burn out.\u201d\nIn regards to the compromises she\u2019s\nhad to make, Amanda refers to when\nshe chose to return to work just 4\nmonths after having twins.\n\u201cAt times I\u2019ve thought \u201cI\u2019m not doing\nthis anymore, I want to stay at home\nwith my sons\u201d. But for me, I was the\nmain breadwinner so I needed to work\nand I also wanted my career \u2013 I\u2019ve\nlearnt to accept that the choice I made\ndoesn\u2019t make me a bad mother, but it\nisn\u2019t always easy.\u201d\nManaging Success\n\u201cI think today, men and women expect both parties to work. There\u2019s\nfewer and fewer stay-at-home-mums,\nbut we still get hit with all these stereotypes \u2013 everything in the media\nand on TV, even fairy tales you read\nyour children \u2013 working women don\u2019t\nmatch the model.\u201d\n\u201cI learnt the hard way that whilst\nsome men like the lifestyle that comes\nwith success, they are very competitive and sometimes can\u2019t cope with\nthe feeling of having a lesser role. But\nhas this stopped me in my career? No,\nbecause I enjoy what I do, I\u2019m com-petitive, and I push myself to succeed.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to learn how to manage\nsuccess, but fundamentally, what I get\nenthralled by are the roles and their\nchallenges. Work doesn\u2019t de\ufb01ne me,\nbut it\u2019s a big part of who I am.\u201d\nGiven that work plays such an obviously large part in her life, I question\nwhether Amanda feels that a glass\nceiling exists. After a good laugh at the\nirony of such a question being posed\nfrom inside the Gherkin, she replies \u201cI\ncan\u2019t see it and I\u2019ve never hit it \u2013 but\nI think in other companies it\u2019s possi-ble, and the lack of senior female executives across business demonstrates\nthat there are issues.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be careful that you\nstay true to yourself and your values,\nthat you don\u2019t try and be a bloke \u2013\nwomen are di\ufb00erent and that\u2019s important for business and for ourselves.\u201d\n\u201cFor example, I always wear col-ours, I have blonde hair, and I wear my\njewellery \u2013 I subconsciously emphasise all the time that I am a female. I\nused to live in dark trouser suits and I\ndon\u2019t now; I live in a business world of\nmen in dark suits, but I don\u2019t need to\nemulate that to be successful. Women\nbring di\ufb00erent skills and styles, and its\nvery valuable in business, particularly\nwomen in male dominated environments because we\u2019ve a di\ufb00erent kit\nbag of skills and interact with people\ndi\ufb00erently.\u201d\n80:20\nContinuing, Amanda says, \u201cpsychologically if there\u2019s an opportunity for\nprogression, women naturally think of\nall the reasons as to why they can\u2019t do\nthat. They may have 80% of the skills\nnailed down, but they\u2019ll think of the\n20% they can\u2019t do. When a man looks\nat the same thing, he naturally looks\nat all the things he can do, and even if\nhe\u2019s only got 20% of the skills required,\nhe will probably apply for the role if he\nwants it and really go for it.\nWomen don\u2019t push as hard, we don\u2019t\nhave conversations with our bosses\nabout our next role and our career\ndevelopment plan. But, if you sit and\nwait, you get passed by. It\u2019s our psyche\nwe have to manage in order to progress rather then the company holding\nus down. If you\u2019ve got the skills for the\njob, you should go for it.\u201d\nRead more at:\nwww.title-mag.com\nAlice Yang interivews Amanda Brumpton, CSC UK&IR, VP Sales\nInspiring Interviews with Successful Women.\nWritten by students, for students\nRead, Aspire, Write. @EditorTITLE titlemagonline\n[TITLE]\nwww.title-mag.com\n\n"

The\nopposition were the old enemy and\nsecond best university in London,\nUCL. A \ufb01xture steeped in history,\nthis was always going to be a di\ufb03cult\n\ufb01xture. It wasn\u2019t. With new recruits\nJames Murphy, Luke Butler, Marius Wedemeyer, Amine Cherif (aka\nCherif Snr) and the returning Peter\nBjorkstrand, on top of 13 goals without reply in 270 minutes, ICUAFC 1s\nwere full of con\ufb01dence. We arrived\nat Shenley with no sign of the oppo-sition; rumours were banded about\nthat Imperial\u2019s multicultural line up\nhad scared the UCL army into sub-mission. However, just when it looked\nlike there would be a no show, they appeared over the hill, armed for battle\n(a football match).\nOur con\ufb01dence was high, and\nrightfully so, as we dicked on them\nfor 90 minutes winning 3-0. Garner\nwas majestic in goals (at each end),\nprotected by To\ufb01s, Woodhead, Amjad and Cherif Snr. The mid\ufb01eld was\nbossed by housemate combo Tim\n\u2018Smithy\u2019 Beasley and Hill, who continues to roll back the years. Width\nwas provided by Murphy and Butler\nspearheaded by Bjorkstrand and Robinson. Unfortunately, Butler\u2019s fancy\nfootwork put him on the receiving\nend of a rash challenge forcing him\no\ufb00 early only to be replaced by Cherif\nJnr. The early exchanges were dominated by Imperial although an early\nshot from UCL talisman James \u2018Just\na shit\u2019 Greatorex produced a smart\nsave by Garner. The \ufb01rst goal came\nfrom a vicious shot by Bjorkstrand\nand, following immense pressure,\nthe UCL defender had no choice but\nto thrash the rebound home from 3\nyards. Imperial continued to dominate with multiple chances much to\nthe dismay of the UCL wags present.\nThe second half brought no respite to\neither the weather, which was appropriately North-sideways sleet, nor the\nUCL goal. A whipped freekick from\nTo\ufb01s resulted in another outstanding\n\ufb01nish from their right mid\ufb01elder this\ntime as he placed his clearance e\ufb00ortlessly into their top corner. The dubious goals panel (controversially) gave\nit as an own goal despite To\ufb01s\u2019 pleas.\nWedemeyer and Nielsen were introduced to kill o\ufb00 the game with one\nhaving more impact than the other.\nWithin 2 touches the former was on\nthe scoresheet. Hill played a simple\n5 yard pass to the ruthless German\nwho, with one touch, turned and got\nit out his feet before placing a \ufb01nesse\nshot over the keeper from what at \ufb01rst\nappeared to be at least 100 yards, but\nwas later con\ufb01rmed as 40. The calls of,\n\u201cKeep the ball!\u201d from the IC mid\ufb01elders, prior to the shot, were a textbook\nexample of how mindgames are still of\nparamount importance in the modern game. Pandemonium ensued, as\nWedemeyer opted for a Henry-esque\nsilencing celebration whilst cheers of\n\u201cGerman e\ufb03ciency!\u201d echoed around\nthe stadium/pitch. The game wound\ndown with a few more chances for\nImperial but none taken. We left taking our \u201cOne way\u201d sign with us. The\nchants of \u2018Get back in your biscuit tin,\nGinger\u2019 and \u2018Oi number 11, number\n11, mate, number 11, you\u2019re shit\u2019 were\nabsent but even without our 12th man,\nvictory was comfortable. Smithy\u2019s industry won him man of the match but\neveryone was impressive; however,\njustice will not truly be served until\nfurther destruction of UCL in the cup.\nNext up were St George\u2019s on the\n31st of October. The reverse \ufb01xture\nthe season before brought back bad\nmemories of a 10 O\u2019clock kick o\ufb00 and\na Cypriot \ufb01nishing the \ufb01nal 5 minutes\nin goal. The squad were buoyed by the\nfalse news that they now played on 3G.\nHowever, upon arrival we were dismayed to hear we would in fact be on\ngrass in the overwhelming stadium of\nhigh \ufb02ying Tooting and Mitcham FC.\nSolace was only found in the pitchside\nchicken van and proper seating for\nour ever growing fan club. Again Imperial dominated despite inappropriate footwear and whining from To\ufb01s\nthat he needed insoles for his boots.\nA wunderstrike from To\ufb01s opened\nthe scoring from a corner delivered by\nthe consistently dangerous Dale. After the ball was weakly cleared, To\ufb01s\nheaded it over an opposition defender\nbefore unleashing an unstoppable\ndrive through the keepers\u2019 butter \ufb01ngers into the net to deafening chants\nof Golaccio from no one. Wedemeyer continued his impressive scoring\nstreak with a clever right-footed \ufb01nish\nfrom a To\ufb01s cross.\nHalf time provided relief for a visibly shaking St George\u2019s against an\nImperial team smelling blood. Imperial pressed to extend their lead with\nmore slick play drawing \u2018Ol\u00e9\u2019s from\nthe crowd. Such was their dominance\nthat Amjad found himself in approximately an acre of space all of 2 yards\nfrom their goal, dead centre, with the\nball before him. No one was quite prepared for what followed: with the goal\nat his mercy the pressure got to him.\nLuke Varney\u2019s midweek miss against\nSouthampton in the Capital One Cup\nwas forgotten in an instant. There was\nscreaming silence from the travelling\nsupporters which was shattered by\na high pitched moan from Amjad\u2019s\nmouth \u2013 a cry of despair, anguish,\npain, remorse, guilt and pure regret.\nThe sadness seen on his face was comparable to that of Achilles mourning\nthe death of Patroclus. He received a\nMan of the Match vote from Garner\nafter the match, but this was widely\nassumed to be a sympathetic gesture.\nBjorkstrand took a leaf out of Amjad\u2019s\nbook by promptly spurning a host of\nchances that Fernando Torres himself\nwould have struggled to miss. Unfortunately, overcommitment from the\nImperial team and a few missed challenges from an otherwise untested defence allowed St Georges to pull back\na sloppy goal, the \ufb01rst goal they had\nconceded in approximately a decade\nof football. This served as a wake up\ncall, lifting Imperial with Wedemeyer\nwinning a penalty after a disgusting\nchallenge from a St Georges defender,\nprompting the 2 travelling supporters\n(Smithy\u2019s parents) to brandish imaginary cards which were unheeded by\nthe immoveable referee.\nThe resulting penalty was comfortably converted by Robinson, sending\nthe keeper to his right whilst nestling\nthe ball in the opposite corner. Smithy\nwon man of the match for the second\nweek running earning himself another embroidered star on his kit bag\n(@SmithysBag). The result was more\nimportant than the scoreline but it\nwas frustrating to have conceded. The\nsquad agreed that we were not good\nenough compared to the new standards set by a team which very possibly\ncould win everything this year.\nWhole Team EffortFootball Team\nDisappointing start for the Falcons\nImperial\u2019s baseball team, the Falcons,\nbegan their season yesterday with\na double header of friendly games\nagainst the University of London Japanese Society.\nThe \ufb01rst game of the day began\namidst some animosity as the opposition catcher was an Imperial College\nstudent, and last year\u2019s hapless vicepresident of the baseball club, who\nthis summer ditched us for ULJS, despite not actually being Japanese. This\nanimosity was apparent as Imperial\u2019s\nstarting pitcher, Hajime Urata, hit him\nwith his second pitch, allegedly by ac-cident.\nIn the \ufb01rst few innings, ULJS\u2019s score\ncrept up, but Imperial\u2019s hitters struggled against a ridiculously good ULJS\npitcher, who, incidentally, had been\nshipped in from Manchester for the\nmatch. Imperial thus failed to score\nin the \ufb01rst four innings, and ULJS \ufb01nished with a four-run \ufb01fth inning, leaving us 8-0 down with our \ufb01nal inning\nleft to play.\nAfter a \ufb02urry of new ULJS pitchers\n(one of which thought he could throw\nknuckleballs), Imperial showed faint\nhints of a comeback, loading the bases with only one out. Unfortunately,\nULJS threw on their last good pitcher\n(this one imported from Edinburgh)\nwho struck out our last two batters.\nThree of our players scored hits in the\n\ufb01nal inning, although I don\u2019t know\nwho they were as the score-sheet dissolved in the horizontal rain that followed the conclusion of the match.\nAfter much huddling under a tree,\nthe rain eased o\ufb00 enough for the second game to start. Both teams were\n\ufb01elding less experienced teams in order to give the fresher\u2019s some experi-ence, including ULJS\u2019s token European\nguy who\u2019d joined them to watch anime.\nImperial started brightly against a\nmuch less experienced pitcher, going\n7-3 up after two innings, thanks to a\nlot of walks and a sacri\ufb01ce \ufb02y by Matt\nBidwell, while the ULJS o\ufb00ence struggled against the pace and power of\nFalcons pitcher Julian Chiu. Imperial\u2019s\nscoring dried up, however, as ULJS\nbrought on another, better pitcher.\nThe opposition then chipped away at\nour lead, going into the \ufb01nal inning\nonly one run behind.\nUnfortunately, ULJS achieved the\ntwo runs needed to secure the walko\ufb00 win, ending a fairly disappointing\nday for the Falcons. The games were,\nhowever, a good experience for our\nnew players, and a crash course in\nBritish weather for the bene\ufb01t of the\nAmericans who joined us. Hopefully,\nthe Falcons will learn from this game\nand improve as we move into the season proper.\nFalcons 0\nULJS 8\nFalcons 7\nULJS 8\nBenjamin Sandy Basketball Team\n\n"

    "content": "According to the World Health Organisation, one in four of us will have\na mental illness at some point in our\nlife, and that by 2030 depression will\nbe the largest cause of disease around\nthe world. That\u2019s a scary statistic.\nMental health issues, be them our\nown or someone else\u2019s, a\ufb00ect us all,\nand yet we don\u2019t talk about them. This\nis the problem cited by Ed Miliband in\nhis speech to the Royal College of Psychiatrists last week.\nMiliband highlights that we are\nignoring a problem that a\ufb00ects all\nof us from every walk of life, and\nproposes to challenge the lack of\nfocus the government has on the issue\nof mental health. He cites personal\nexperience of counselling after the\ndeath of his father, Ralph Miliband,\nand talks about the brave decision of\nLabour MP Kevan Jones to talk openly\nabout his depression.\nThe government have cut \u00a3150m\nfrom services for people su\ufb00ering with\nmental health problems, and outreach\nprogrammes. Imagine, he asked, if\nthis was from funding for strokes, or\nheart disease.\nHe emphasises that mental health\nproblems will not go away if we\nignore them, so we have to tackle the\nprejudice and the taboo. Mental health\nprovisions need to be properly funded,\nand health and social care providers\nneed to be better educated to deal with\nthe demands that increased rates of\nmental health conditions are putting\non the NHS and especially the prison\nservice, where 70% of inmates have\na mental health condition. Miliband\nrecognises that not all conditions can\nbe cured, but we can and should o\ufb00er\nmore support for those su\ufb00ering.\nPerhaps the most coverage of this\nspeech was in the reaction it received\nfrom Jeremy Clarkson, who was\nattacked by Ed for his insensitive\ncomments \u2013 \u201cJeremy Clarkson, who\nmay have at least acknowledged the\ntragedy of people who end their own\nlives, goes on to call them \u2018Johnny\nSuicides\u2019 whose bodies should be\nleft on train tracks rather than delay\njourneys.\u201d Clarkson responded by\nasking if Ed Miliband was \u201cright in the\nhead.\u201d\nDespite the taboo around talking\nabout mental health, the speech could\nbe considered an easy way to gain\nmedia coverage over the Coalition\nby the government, but things are\nchanging across the political spectrum\nin the way that mental health is talked\nabout. In September, the Conservative\nand Labour front benches supported\nConservative MP, Gavin Barwell\u2019s\nMental Health Discrimination Bill,\nwhich would prevent discrimination\nbased on mental health. Currently any\nperson who has ever su\ufb00ered from a\n\u2018mental disorder\u2019 is banned from jury\nservice, and any person who has been\nsectioned for more than 6 months\nis barred from serving as an MP,\nschool governor or company director,\nirrespective of their current state of\nmental health.\nThe tide is not just changing in\npolitical circles, but the celebrity\nworld is opening up about mental\nhealth too, trying to emphasise that\nmental health a\ufb00ects us all. Actor,\nRebecca Front started a twitter\nhashtag, #whatstigma, in February\nlast year \u2013 it trended for days as users\nshared their experiences of mental\nhealth. There is still a long way to go\nto tackle the stigma, but as more and\nmore people feel able to talk openly\nabout mental health issues, we are\nslowly seeing change and a big speech\nfrom a UK party leader is a sight that\nshould be encouraged.\nhttp://www.mind.org.uk/\nMiliband opens debate on mental health\nKirstin Hay Politics Writer\nPOLITICS\n17\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTime To Change\nA Letter From America\nArthur Turrell Politics Writer\nt 6am on Monday\nmorning, groggy from\njetlag and the 15mg of\nvalium I took on the\nplane, I sat in a taxi in\ndowntown San Francisco waiting to\nbe driven to a car rental company.\nThe driver asked if it was my \ufb01rst time\nin San Francisco and I told him that\nit was. In the blunt light of dawn, we\ncrashed up and down San Francisco\u2019s\ninclined streets, and I noticed steam\nrising from the man-hole covers. It\nwas America as I had imagined it.\nLurching down another main road,\nhe pointed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lone\nmidget hooker\u201d. When I looked I saw\na dwarf in an uncompromising red\ndress checking her long, blonde hair\nin a shop window. There was no hint\nof judgement by the taxi driver. This\nwas not America as I had imagined it.\nNor was the needlessly large but hybrid rental car I was given; I\u2019d wanted a\nbeat up \u201949 Hudson \u00e0 la Jack Kerouac\u2019s\nOn The Road. However, it struck me\nas I drove over the Golden Gate bridge\nand stopped at a vantage point on the\nnorth side of the bay that what I had\nreceived was more re\ufb02ective of modern America, with its inherent contradictions and con\ufb02icts. Presidential\nelections are reminders that such a\nvast country has to accommodate the\ndi\ufb00erent views of 300 million people.\nCalifornia has voted Democrat for\nthe last \ufb01ve elections, and it is no surprise that this liberal state has gone\nObama\u2019s way again. Perhaps that\u2019s why\nA\nthe Americans at my hotel didn\u2019t seem\noverly concerned by the election, even\nthough television channels pumped\nout endless predictions, analysis and\nsound bites. Barely a soul looked up as\nthe American football game showing\nat the bar was interrupted by short interviews with each of the candidates,\nObama looking weary but con\ufb01dent,\nRomney with a background of carefully placed football paraphernalia.\nI am not a US citizen but I did manage to vote on election day, in a ballot\nrun by the organisers of my confer-ence. Our vote was a landslide 90%\nvictory for Obama. Later, at the conference dinner, whispers of an Obama\nvictory in the real election were whirling around the room by the time we\nwere onto the second course. I called\nover an American colleague whose\nface was lit up by their smart phone\nand asked what was happening. \u201cIt\u2019s\nFox news,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve called\nit for Obama.\u201d We knew then that a\nDemocrat victory was certain. Back in\nthe bar, as Obama spoke, the feeling in\nthe room was one of relief rather than\nexcitement. \u2018Four more years\u2019 does not\nhold the same promise that \u2018yes we\ncan\u2019 did. A group of Republicans halfheartedly booed as everyone else was\nglued to the victory speech.\nThe day before the election, I had\nbeen chatting to an American couple\nwho were sharing a beer outside the\nbar. She and her husband joked that\nit didn\u2019t much matter who got elected.\n\u2018It\u2019s the Supreme Court I\u2019m worried\nabout,\u2019 she said, \u2018there\u2019s a good chance\ntwo of the members will die in the next\nfour years and whoever wins the election appoints new ones\u2019. The Supreme\nCourt has nine members, in the simplest terms four are liberal, four are\nconservative and one is a conservative who occasionally sides with the\nliberals. This last member often calls\nwhich way the 5-4 split will fall. My\nAmerican friends felt that the constitutional right to abortion, established\nby the famous Roe v. Wade case, could\nbe threatened by a Romney victory,\nas a pro-choice member is likely to\nbe replaced. This would mean states\nsetting their own abortion laws, with\nsome undoubtedly opting to enact a\ncomplete ban.\nObama\u2019s victory means that this\nwon\u2019t now happen, but the extent to\nwhich this election was in\ufb02uenced by\nmoral issues is surprising. In Britain,\nMPs are increasingly given a free vote\non moral issues. It feels like America\nis heading in the other direction, with\nincreasing politicisation them since\nRoe v. Wade. Opinions on abortion\nand gay marriage are held strongly,\nand defended vigorously, and the battles fought over them have inevitably\na\ufb00ected the outcome of the election.\nTwo Republicans aiming for seats\nin the Senate were brought down by\ntheir comments on abortion. Todd\nAkin fundamentally misunderstood\nbiology when he talked about the body\nshutting down in cases of \u2018legitimate\nrape\u2019, and Richard Mourdock implied\nthat abortion was unacceptable be-cause, horrible as rape might be, God\nmust have intended the victim to be\npregnant. This is not the mainstream\nRepublican view, but it has cost seats\nin the Senate and damaged the image\nof the party.\nBut it is not just moral issues that are\nthe cause of the bitter divisions in contemporary American politics. Republicans and Democrats at the national\nlevel seem incapable of understanding\none another\u2019s point of view, let alone\nforging the kind of compromises that\nare required for e\ufb00ective government.\nIn Britain, we are still getting used to\nlife under a coalition, but, so far, it has\nfunctioned. In the United States, a\nuniting of parties is unthinkable.\nAnd yet the elephant and the donkey have much to gain from working together, even though consensus\nseems to be so di\ufb03cult to achieve. The\nRepublicans face a demographic collapse over the next decade as many of\ntheir supporters are subject to what\ncan only be politely called natural\nwastage. They need to broaden their\nappeal if they are to win back moder-ates, women, ethnic minorities and\nthe young. A rejection of the aggressively partisan politics represented\nby the Tea Party movement would be\na good start. Those on the right are\nunlikely to abandon a more moderate Republican presidential candidate\nbecause there would not be a more attractive alternative.\nObama needs to build bridges with\nthe Republicans; the Democrat Senate\nmajority is not big enough to stop \ufb01libusters, and the house remains under\nGOP control. More importantly, the\nnational vote only gave Obama a paper thin mandate. To really represent\nthe interests of the US people, he has\nto factor in that half of the voting population did not want to see his policies\nenacted.\nIn the few tired and exciting days\nthat I have spent here, America has\nproven itself to be split in two. Now\nthat the battle for the presidency has\nabated for \u2018four more years\u2019, this vast\ncountry, so variable in geography,\nwealth and mentality, needs its politicians to forge the compromises that\nwill cater for all of its people, from\nthe hard-line Republicans to the hardworking hookers of San Francisco.\n\n"

Ever\ndebated the pros and cons\nof starting a business over\na career? Ever wondered if you can\nstart your own business? Ever thought\nabout starting your own business\nbut don\u2019t know how? Silicon Valley\nComes to Imperial (SVC2Imperial)\nis your chance to get answers to all of\nthese questions.\nSVC2Imperial is run in conjunction with Global Entrepreneurship\nWeek (GEW), which will take place\nthis coming week. GEW is an adaptation of Enterprise Week in the UK.\nCo-founded by The Ewing Marion\nKau\ufb00man Foundation, which was established in the mid-1960s by the late\nentrepreneur and philanthropist Ewing Marion Kau\ufb00man, their vision is\nto foster \u201ca society of economically\nindependent individuals who are engaged citizens, contributing to the\nimprovement of their communities\u201d.\nGEW UK is now hosted by Youth\nBusiness International, a global network of independent, non-pro\ufb01t initiatives helping young people start and\ngrow their own business and create\nemployment.\nNow GEW has become the world\u2019s\nlargest campaign to promote en-trepreneurship, taking place in 115\ncountries. The theme this year is to\n\u2018Pass it On!\u2019 \u2013 to provide the practical\nhelp & support needed by early start-ups and individuals who are considering taking the plunge.\nIn the spirit of GEW, another organ-isation, \u2018Silicon Valley Comes to the\nUK\u2019 (SVC2UK) has a similar purpose.\nSVC2UK is a not-for-pro\ufb01t series of\nindustry supported events organised by Sherry Coutu, the UK\u2019s most\nprominent angel investor, and Reid\nHo\ufb00man, early Facebook investor and\nfounder of LinkedIn. SVC2UK brings\nleading Silicon Valley Entrepreneurs,\ninvestors, and thought leaders to the\nUK to explore ideas and to inspire\nlocal entrepreneurship. Entering its\nsixth year, over the same week as\nGEW, Silicon Valley and UK leaders\nin entrepreneurship will lead work-shops, masterclasses and lectures\nacross the UK, with the aim to debate,\ndiscuss, create and fund today\u2019s most\ninnovative technologies to change\nour world in the years to come. It\u2019s\ndesigned to improve the ecosystem\nfor entrepreneurship in the UK and\nEurope.\nIn partnership with SVC2UK,\nImperial Entrepreneurs is running\nSVC2Imperial. SVC2Imperial encompasses three free events over two\ndays, held on Thursday 15th and Saturday 17th of November 2012.\nOn the Thursday there will be a\nlive stream of the opening SVC2UK\nconference held in Cambridge from\n5.30PM till 7pm. The opening conference will consist of a panel of Silicon Valley and UK speakers, talking\nabout scaling up and the challenges\nfaced. Speakers will include Venture\nCapitalists (eg. Raj Kapoor, May\ufb01eld\nFund), Founders and Chief O\ufb03cers\n(e.g. Renaud Visage, Eventbrite) and\nEducators (Bobbi Kurshan, Executive\nDirector of Academic Innovation &\nSenior Fellow in Education).\nOn that same day at SVC2Imperial\nthere will also be a CEO & Investor\nWorkshop and Networking Dinner.\nCEOs from some of the most promising start-ups in our ecosystem,\nwhich are in the process of scaling\nup, are invited to attend a workshop\nwith successful local entrepreneurs\nand Silicon Valley CEOs and execu-tives, where facilitators will share\ntheir experiences and participants\ncan troubleshoot any current issues.\nIt provides a unique opportunity for\nstart-up CEOs to learn from the best\nin the business. The purpose is to\nbring together like-minded people\nin hope of increasing the interaction\namongst the entrepreneurship community not only in Imperial College\nLondon but in the whole of London.\nThe Saturday will mainly consist of\na conference running from 10am till\n5pm. The day will be split into three\nparts: Masterclass, Company Showcase and Keynote Lectures. In the\nMasterclass, there will be workshops\nand panel discussions run by successful entrepreneurs, industrialists,\nauthors and businesses. Students will\nget the chance to hear from leaders\nfrom the local ecosystems on a range\nof entrepreneurship topics; from lean\nstart-up methodologies to why you\nshould join/start start-ups and how it\ndi\ufb00ers from a corporate career.\nThe Company Showcase is an opportunity for companies to showcase\ntheir ideas, businesses and technologies to the Imperial community giving them exposure and a chance to inspire students who would like to join\nor found start-ups. It provides a way\nfor Imperial Students to interact with\nlocal entrepreneur companies.\nThe Keynote Lectures will have successful entrepreneurs give speeches\nand run multiple discussions for an\nentire afternoon. The aim is to motivate and inspire students by sharing\nthe success stories of established entrepreneurs as well as providing ad-vice. Some topics of lectures are how\nan idea can grow to become a great\nstart-up and how you can create a\ngreat team. If you have started, how to\novercome adversity and fear.\nThe main purpose of SVC2Imperial is to bring the \u2018start-up mentality\u2019\nfound in abundance in Silicon Valley\n(San Francisco) to Imperial.\nImperial Entrepreneurs\u2019 motivations for running these events are to\nconnect Imperial College London\nstudents with Imperial College London start-ups, and introduce these\nstart-ups to well established London\nstart-ups and investors. We also aim\nto create an environment where various entrepreneurship related topics\ncould be discussed.\nThe conference is suited to everyone\nat Imperial; we have di\ufb00erent workshops tailored to your needs whether\nyou have your own business or have\nnever thought about entrepreneur-ship. To register your interest and\nkeep up to date with the latest news\nyou can become a member of Imperial Entrepreneurs (for free!), we will\nkeep you informed through our Facebook page.\nE\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor: Deepka Rana\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n\n"

    "content": "I was recently challenged to rate every\n\ufb01lm I have ever seen. Apart from being\na shockingly huge task, it also threw\nup a massive problem. Because there\nare incredible \ufb01lms for every emotion.\nAnd of course there are some Godawful \ufb01lms too \u2013 less said about these\nthe better. The problem I have is,that\nthere are some terrible \ufb01lms that I\nadore. Films that I will watch over and\nover in secret; \ufb01lms that I suspect everyone loves but is ashamed to admit.\nWell, since nobody ever thought I was\ncool, and since my taste in \ufb01lm is already universally known to be dodgy;\nconsider this my o\ufb03cial confession.\nShit films I love (or why I sh\nThe Fog (1980)\nThe original, not the waste-of-oxygen\nWainwright remake. Inhabitants of a\ncoastal town fall victim to their troubled history. 100 years earlier, six of\nthe town\u2019s founders deliberately sank a\nboat, using its cargo to build the town,\nand killing all the sailors aboard. On\nthe towns centennial, a glowing fog\nrolls into town, containing the zombie sailors, who kill six of the town\u2019s\nresidents to settle the score. For 80s\nhorror this isn\u2019t bad, and was John\nCarpenter\u2019s \ufb01rst \ufb01lm after Halloween,\nwhich was released a couple of years\nearlier (also starring Jamie Lee Curtis).\nIt is undeniably low budget: the glowing fog looks more school disco than\nsupernatural, the gore is unrealistic,\nand close-up shots of the zombies\nreveal less than perfect prosthetics;\nhowever, I still \ufb01nd the \ufb01lm utterly\nterrifying. The zombie threat is under-stated, playing more on the fear of the\nunknown than explicit threat, and the\nscore is fantastic (unusual for cheap\nhorror) contributing to an absorbing\nand intense experience. This is classic independent horror \u2013 Carpenter\nshould never have agreed to the 2005\nremake, which featured the incompetent acting \u2018talents\u2019 of Tom Welling\nand Maggie Grace, and while had superior e\ufb00ects, could not compete with\nTop Gun (1986)\nI was recently asked to explain the plot\nto a backwards friend who hasn\u2019t seen\nthe \ufb01lm. He couldn\u2019t understand why\nI\u2019d included it in the list, as it scores\nin all the right areas \u2013 Tom Cruise,\n\ufb01ghter jets, fatal accidents and plenty\nof faux-macho behaviour. In fact, it\nwas the highest grossing \ufb01lm of 1986,\nand caused an in\ufb02ux of Navy recruits\nafter its release. When Pete \u2018Maverick\u2019 Mitchell (Cruise) and his wing-man Goose are sent to the Navy\u2019s\nFighter Weapons School, Maverick\nfalls for his female teacher, and overcomes crippling doubts after Goose is\ntragically killed in a training accident.\nThis \ufb01lm is completely and unashamedly inaccurate \u2013 the main source of\ncriticism is its lack of realism, but that\nsimply doesn\u2019t matter to me. Top Gun\nis about bromance, being as camp as\nhumanly possible, and \ufb02ying awesome\nplanes. And again, the nine times platinum soundtrack is one of the most\npopular OSTs ever, featuring the Oscar winning \u201cTake My Breath Away\u201d.\nBut none of that can save it from its\nrelentlessly awful lines, continuous\nshower scenes, and the distinct impression that if the Village People\nrocked up at naval base, it would look\na little something like Top Gun.\nCrocodile Dundee (1986)\nMick Dundee, a less shit version of\nBear Grylls, falls in love with a New\nYork journalist when he shows her\naround the Australian outback for an\narticle she is writing about him. He\nrescues her from the jaws of a croco-dile, and she brings him back to New\nYork, where Dundee struggles to \ufb01t\nin with cosmopolitan life. This \ufb01lm is\nhilariously terrible; full of cliches and\ncheesy moments, and so inauthen-tic I\u2019m sure no Australian has ever\nwatched it. Nonetheless, Crocodile\nDundee is a \ufb01rm favourite of mine\nbecause it is charming, adventure\npacked and has some spectacular sobad-they\u2019re-good lines.\nDead Calm (1989)\nDespite a great cast (Nicole Kidman,\nSam Neill and Billy Zane), this thriller\nis, objectively, middle of the road at\nbest. Kidman and Neill embark on a\njourney on their yacht in a bid to get\nover the death of their son in a car ac-cident. They encounter Zane after they\ncross paths with a sinking schooner,\nbut soon \ufb01nd out that he isn\u2019t just a\nstranded survivor, but in fact a mur-derous, Botulinum infected psycho.\nBad times. Zane is unpredictable in\nthe role \u2013 a living scrapbook of all the\nmentally defected villains in cinematic\nhistory: one minute he\u2019s calm and cal-culated, and the next he\u2019s o\ufb00 his rocks.\nThe script isn\u2019t great, but suspense is\nkept throughout. And there are some\nproper scare moments \u2013 I still require\ncushions to hide behind whilst watch-ing.\nThe Bodyguard (1992)\nThe soundtrack to this \ufb01lm is the business \u2013 an homage to Whitney Houston, featuring it\u2019s title track and epic\n\u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d, \u201cRun To You\u201d\nplus dud \u201cQueen of the Night\u201d (what\nwas Houston thinking?). Houston\nplays Rachel, (essentially playing her-self), a famous singer and actress who\ncomes into desperate need of a bodyguard (Kevin Costner) after it emerges\nshe has a stalker with motivation to\nkill her. In the \ufb01lm\u2019s closing scenes,\nCostner takes a bullet for Houston\nas she collects her Oscar (she wishes)\nin slow motion \u2013 the original VHS I\nowned of this \ufb01lm eventually wore\nout at this part because I replayed it\nso often. Shockingly bad acting from\nnearly all involved aside, no amount\nof shunning can take away from this\n\ufb01lm\u2019s appeal. This said, I\u2019m in no rush\nto see it on stage (it\u2019s musical version\ncomes to the West End this month), as\nwithout the chemistry between Costner and Houston, not to mention the\nunrivalled vocals of the female lead,\nthe story would be dead in the water.\nSpeed (1994)\nKeanu Reeves can\u2019t act. He tries his\nbest, but he has no discernible tal-ent. He is expressionless, monotonous\nand delivers his lines like a priest giving a eulogy. His only saving grace in\nthis \ufb01lm is, and it\u2019s quite a considerable saving grace, his beautiful face\nand hot body. If only his role as Jack,\nNYPD cop with a penchant for throwing himself o\ufb00 fast moving objects,\nwas a silent one. When a madman\nrigs a bus with a bomb that will explode when the bus\u2019s speed dips below\n50mph, Jack, with the help of Gracie\n(Sandra Bullock again) at the wheel,\n\ufb01ght to save the lives of the passengers\naboard. The \ufb01lm does have some good\naction sequences, but peaks too early\n\u2013the lift scenes at the start are probably the best, and should have been\nbetter developed.\nJumanji (1995)\nEvery 90s kid should know what this\nis \u2013 if you don\u2019t, what were you do-ing? Not watching the most awesome\n\ufb01lm probably ever made, that\u2019s for\nsure. For the deprived, Robin William\u2019s younger self is sucked into a supernatural game, Jumanji, and transported to a distant jungle. Years later,\na couple of orphans \ufb01nd the game,\nbring Williams, who by now resembles Tarzan, back into the present\nday, along with a host of CGI jungle\nanimals that at the time, I was convinced were real (watching now, the\ne\ufb00ects are pretty poor, but it doesn\u2019t\nmatter.) The orphans, Williams, and\nhis original game opponent, play the\ngame against the odds to send the jungle creatures back to the jungle. I love\nthis \ufb01lm because it packs in endless\nadventure and imagination. Escapism\nin a \ufb01lm, original, and my childhood\nall wrapped into 100 minutes of pure\ncomedy gold. Even now, when rolling\na dice, I privately recite the immortal\nwarning: \u201cIn the jungle, you must wait,\nuntil you roll a \ufb01ve or eight\u201d.\nSpace Jam (1996)\nAgain, if you were born in the 90s you\nshould know this \ufb01lm like the back of\nyour hands. Starring NBA star Michael Jordan and the cast of the Looney Tunes, this part sports comedy part\nanimation extravaganza is a \ufb01lm I\u2019m\nnot ashamed to admit I love. A band of\nanimated alien terrorists, The Nerdlucks, try to kidnap the Looney Tunes,\nin a desperate plot to save their tanking theme-park, Moron Mountain. A\nbargain is struck for their release \u2013 the\naliens, being tiny, are challenged to a\ngame of basketball \u2013 but they have a\ntrick up their sleeves. The Nerdlucks\nsteal the sporting talents of the 1996\nNBA championship team, and transform into giant basketball playing ma-chines. To help them win, the Tunes\nrecruit a recently retired Jordan, and\ntogether they eventually defeat the\nteam of evil aliens, propelling Jordan\nback into the NBA (in real life too).\nThe animation is classic Warner Bros,\nthe script is hilariously cheesy, and the\nsoundtrack is brilliant, going six times\nplatinum and featuring R. Kelly\u2019s best\nsong \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d. Space Jam\nwas pretty much panned by the crit-ics, but was a massive success despite\nthe poor reviews.\nParent Trap (1998)\nBack in the days of video-stores, I requested this remake so many times\nmy parents could have paid for its\nproduction (probably). Lindsay Lohan\nplays identical twins Hallie and Annie, separated when their parents divorced and moved to separate sides of\nthe world. The twins meet for the \ufb01rst\ntime at holiday camp, and cunningly\nswitch places without their parents\nknowledge in a secret plot to reunite\nthe family. This \ufb01lm has some great\ncharacters, funny script and a really\ngreat soundtrack. Lohan is super cute\n(what happened?), although nowadays\nI \ufb01nd the mirroring and doubles used\nto create the twins annoying. There\nis a lot of blatant stereotyping going\non, and the plot is predictable; but it\ntransports me straight back to childhood with its wholesome light-heart-ed goodness.\nKaty Bettany \u201cFilm Editor\u201d\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n34 FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n\n"

Representing 20 of the world\u2019s\ntop universities, The Open Academy\nhas lecture material including videos,\nslides, exercises and practice exams,\nfrom introductory to advanced level.\nThey are not the \ufb01rst to do this. In\n2002 MIT announced that it would\nbe \u201copening\u201d its classrooms, o\ufb00ering\nits courses online for free. Since then,\nothers have followed suit including\nHarvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford\nand Columbia. The movement has\nnow reached over 200 universities\nacross continents. MIT and Harvard\nhave recently joined forces to create the online resource EdX \u2013 setting aside $60million and aiming to\n\u201ceducate 1 billion people around the\nworld\u201d.\nIndividuals have also started to\nteach online for all subjects, from\nmusic to maths. Salman Khan, an\nMIT alumnus, quit his job at a hedge\nfund to teach on YouTube, eventually\nfounding the Khan Academy.\nThe Open Academy was founded on similar ideals. They say that\neducational background de\ufb01nes \u201cso\nmuch of us\u201d. The team say they were\nkeen to o\ufb00er people the opportunity\nto educate themselves at their own\npace. They said: \u201cHaving all the available educational resources under our\nhands made sense as this was the way\nwe learned. Making a website out of it\njust came as a natural outcome. This\nwas something that we wanted to exist.\u201d\nThe students came up with the idea\nin 2011, and gathered people that\nthey thought could help them. They\nthen worked on building the website\nduring the summer. \u201cBy December we\nhad the \ufb01rst version of the site ready\nwith enough material to take it live,\nbut not enough to bring it to the level\nthat we wanted it to be\u201d.\nAt present 7 people are working on\nthe project, handling programming,\nlegal issues and PR, as well as continuing research and development. With\none of the creators of the site saying \u201cI\nspend about 20 hours a week on the\nproject\u201d.\nAll of the material is arranged on\nthe website by subject. The team hope\nto expand the website as much as pos-sible, building up an extensive library\nof PDF notes and exercises. Open\nAcademy hope to pursue partnerships with the universities themselves\n(it already o\ufb00ers some courses run by\nOxford) and help them expand their\nonline presence.\nThe hope is to for the amount of\ncontent on the website to increase,\nand say that they have \u201ca bunch of\nideas that we think will enhance user\ninteractiveness and at the same time\ncreate new content\u201d.\nThey say they are \u201creally excited\u201d\nabout all of the future plans that they\nhave, but don\u2019t want to \u201cspoil the surprise\u201d.\nThe Open Academy team ended by\nsaying: \u201cThe Open Academy a truly\ndiverse and unique academic centre in\nthe Web. We realized the sheer number of things that can be done to enrich it and have never been as excited\nabout it as we are now. \u201c\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER 27\nIn a way they are complementary,\nnot competing. Part of what I am\ntrying to do is open doors and help\npeople to understand how science\ncan help complement how they understand the world alongside other\nthings.\nM: Where do you think these di\ufb00erences arise?\nG: Maybe our education system silos\npeople too much, separating them out\ninto art and science and having very\ndi\ufb00erent ways of thinking. I\u2019m not\nsure it has to be like that. I meet young\npeople all the time who feel this way\nand are trying to bridge the gap and\ntalk about the world in all its beautiful\ncomplexity by whatever means they\ncan.\nI do think that people like black and\nwhite and I think everybody could do\nbetter if they were more curious about\nthings. More open to uncertainty,\nwhich is everywhere.\nM: How do you explain your work to\nscientist and engineers who may be\nmore sceptical?\nG: I don\u2019t really come across any overt\nscepticism, not after the \ufb01rst few min-utes. People are very generous with\ntheir ideas and time. I always try to\nlisten and learn as openly and attentively as possible and give something\nback. It is always a dialogue.\nM: Can you give me some examples of projects you have worked on\nwhile you have been here?\nG: I have made so many things and\nthink of each one like a short poem \u2013\nsome hitting the mark or \ufb01nding resonance better than others\nOne of the \ufb01lms is called Chalkboard and is something I made with a\ntheoretical physicist. It was images of\na chalkboard, which sounds mundane\nand uninteresting. They were close-ups, using a special lens and the backing track is of his singing. He does this\nthroat singing \u2013 producing di\ufb00erent\nvoices from one head, I don\u2019t know if\nyou have ever come across that sort of\nsinging. It is probably from Mongolian regions.\nIt is about a three minute \ufb01lm. Fascinatingly, if you look closely at the\nchalkboard it takes you to another\nworld, another cosmos opens. The\n\ufb01lm is really successful at expressing\nwhat if feels like to be on the edge of\nknowledge, to be working in that way.\nI\u2019m gauging it by peoples\u2019 reactions to\nit.\nThe yurt on the roof a little natural\nlight cinema so the yurt has a hole in\nthe roof, so the light \ufb02ushes through\nthe hole. Our project will work by\npassing light through an LCD screen\nso it\u2019s like your \ufb01lm transparency,\ndown onto a table. So the \ufb01lms are\nbeing projected on the table just using the light outside. And when clouds\ngo over the image will go darker. I love\nthat idea. You are beholden to nature.\nWhat limited electronics you need to\nrun the LCD screen and the speakers.\nA few watts will come of these \ufb02exible\nplastic photovoltaic cells, so it will just\ngenerate it\u2019s own electricity.\nIt\u2019s a pop up so it can just pop up\nanywhere. It can go onto the street or\ninto schools, exhibitions or festivals\nand be this atmospheric, welcom-ing, non-threatening environment to\nwatch some of these \ufb01lms.\nThere will be all sorts of di\ufb00erent\nthings we could show like Chalkboard\nfor example to give people a sense of\nsome of the work that goes on here in\na more sensory way I suppose. It\u2019s the\npoetics of discovery.\nM: Is there something unique about\nphysics because it is so fundamental\nto our very existence. Do you think\nyou would ever see yourself working\nother departments?\nG: I think I am really attracted to\nphysics. What is it with physics? I\nthink what personally I love the investigation into the inanimate. It is just\npurely a question of \ufb01nding out more\nabout the world, no matter how many\nbusiness cases physicist write to say\n\u2018that this is to make that, or this will\nhelp us make that\u2019. Fundamentally it is\ncuriosity based. and I love the purity\nof that.\nThere is lots of good work going on\nother \ufb01elds. But I think that pure curiosity is probably the essence of my\nproject. And there is a great beauty in\nthe creation of abstract models and\ntesting and applying them around the\nuniverse. Like a casting of the human\nmind. It is a powerful thing to do, but\nalso comes with great limitations inherent in the human mind. This story\nof power and humility is also a part of\nmy project.\nM: Do you ever feel yourself drawn\nto go into research yourself?\nG: I think I don\u2019t have what it takes.\nI like exploring di\ufb00erent ways of expressing ideas and as a friend of mine\nsaid the other day: we absolutely do\nnot want self expression in the labora-tory. On the theory side, I haven\u2019t got\nthe head for the maths and probably\nand on the experimental side, maybe I\nhaven\u2019t got the patience.\nThere is possibly useful work that I\nam doing. There is something strange\nabout having someone in the physics\ndepartment who has studied physics\nand art, who is always asking ques-tions, but never going to ask you\nwhether something is examinable, and\nwho wanders around all the \ufb01elds of\nphysics.\nI\u2019m walking around all the time and\nasking questions and playing things\nback to people. Telling it in a di\ufb00erent\nway. People say that it actually helps\nthem think about physics. So there is\nsome role I can play that\u2019s of bene\ufb01t as\nan artist. Although it is not helping in\nany direct way a person\u2019s research. It\nseems to me that scientists can enjoy\nthe work I produce for the guy on the\nstreet as much as the guy in the street.\nM - Do you think every department\nshould have a... someone in your\nrole?\nG: You know, I really don\u2019t know. It all\ndepends on the people \u2013 it\u2019s not something that can necessarily be organised\nby shipping artists into organisations.\nThere can certainly be great bene\ufb01ts.\nThis is a very personal project for\nme, it\u2019s very philosophical and personally driven, so I behave in a certain\nway. The reason I am not looking at\nworking in other departments, is also\nthat I am overwhelmed here. It is a\nreally big department, I\u2019ve changed\ntrack so many times in my life, I just\ncan\u2019t go and do it again. This is really\nenough. This is a big pie to eat.\nFind out more about Geraldine\u2019s work at\nwww.findingpatterns.info\nciting than a lot of art. The ideas come\nso thick and fast here and it colours in\nyour mental image of the world. So for\nme \u2013 this is the most stimulating place\nto hang out. M - Wow! Newsflash!\nYou can de\ufb01nitely have too many\nphysicists in one room. De\ufb01nitely...\nmore than two [laughs].\nMy own experience of life is richer\nbecause anything I look at has layers\nof meaning. I can look at the poem I\nread yesterday that makes me look at\nthe world in a di\ufb00erent way, or I can\nlook at what is happening to the light\nbouncing o\ufb00 the tree down there. It\njust makes every moment richer.\nOne of the things I am really interested in is how physics identi\ufb01es pat-terns. My project is called \ufb01nding pat-terns. So that was a notion, and idea I\nhad at the start. I see it really strongly\nnow, the name is really the right name.\nM: Do you feel that there is a big\nvoid between the art world as you\nexperienced it and academia and\nthe sciences?\nG: I have to be so careful with this.\nYou can be so in\ufb02ammatory. This feels\nlike home to me. I can really talk to\npeople here. I feel like I understand\nthe way they think. I am less at home\nin the art world and I\u2019m not sure why\nthat is.\nThere is something about the scientist and the engineer, maybe because\nthey are looking outwards and because they are completely beholden\nto nature somehow. There is a check\non them. Whereas artists, they are in\na more boy band world and there is\na machine operating that selects you\nand promotes you. It\u2019s a rather mysterious machine based on all sorts of\nforces. And I couldn\u2019t tell you what\nthey are.\nSome people sense that: that artists\nhave an agenda to put out there and\nthey will do that at any cost rather\nthan being open to learning.\nMaybe it\u2019s down to education. Maybe it\u2019s just that people don\u2019t have a way\nin. A friend always says that science is\na channel, or a way of looking at the\nworld, as is poetry or painting. The\nmost wonderful thing is to include\nvarious aspects of those in your life as\nways of talking about your experience\nof being there and understanding it.\nAll matter is the same, Oil on linen\nThe Physicist, Oil on japanese window paper\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n46\nWinning is easy for Women\u2019s Rugby\nImperial Women\u2019s Rugby has seen\na fantastic start to their 2012-2013\nseason, winning their first three\ngames with impressive margins.\nThe success began even before the\nmatches started, with a strong turnout for Fresher\u2019s Fair and our taster\nsession, which says a lot about the effectiveness of certain team members\nenticing freshers to the stall through\nthe medium of dance! Our large intake this year sees a range of talent,\nfrom those who have played competitively before to those who had never\neven picked up a rugby ball before\nthis year but all show great potential\nand enthusiasm for the game. With a\nnew team assembled, it wasn\u2019t long\nbefore our first game of the year \u2013 a\nfriendly away at Oxford University.\nThis game set the tone for the season to follow with a great turnout of\nthe new members, with Carolanne\nVouriot scoring our first try of the\nyear! Oxford put forward a largely\nFresher opposition but this provided\na great opportunity for those who\nhadn\u2019t played before to experience\nthe often chaotic world of rugby\nagainst a more evenly-matched side.\nOur new girls took to the challenge\nwith admirable panache and enthusiasm whilst our senior members\nled by example. 80 minutes later and\nImperial stood slightly muddy and\nprobably fairly bruised, but victorious with a full-time score of 31-10.\nKudos to our men of the match \u2013\nnewcomer Juliet Lennon and last\nyear\u2019s captain Kath Fok!\nNot content with this single suc-cess, Imperial took to the field a\nweek later to begin their London\nUniversities Sports Leagues (LUSL)\ncampaign against Royal Holloway\nat Harlington. This match required\nmuch more serious game faces due\nto the presence of several very experienced players on Holloway\u2019s side,\nbut Imperial were not deterred. A\nstrong message was sent out by Imperial\u2019s solid defence which managed to hold off the opposition for\nthe entire first half whilst simultaneously racking up tries aplenty from\nold and new members alike. This\ntry bonanza continued on into the\nsecond half, though it was met with\ngreater resistance from a reinvigor-ated Royal Holloway who managed\nto break through to set up a try\nand conversion which we allowed\nout of respect and extreme polite-ness. By the final whistle Imperial\nhad clocked a massive 58-7 win and\nwere celebrating in the appropriate\nfashion (i.e. a cheeky pint down the\npub). Congratulations go to our men\nof the match: Ran Xiong, for her notable double try and all round gusto,\nand Carolanne Vouriot for making\nconsistently awesome tackles and\nsome really solid runs!\nWith a desire to keep the winning\nstreak live, Imperial approached\nKingston University with caution on\nthe 4th November as the opponents\nwere a relatively new team of unknown skill. Despite this, the teams\nfaced off with Imperial leading from\nthe front despite freezing conditions\nand uncontested scrums from the\nfirst five minutes, which provided a\ndisadvantage as our scrum usually\ndelivers knock out performances.\nHowever, we made up for this in our\nline-outs which were consistently\neffective for our own throw-ins and\noften during our opponents as well!\nWith a season\u2019s best score of 67-0 to\nImperial, Lucy Olliff and Juliet Lennon were richly rewarded as men of\nthe match \u2013 Lucy for her all-round\nsolid commitment on the pitch and\nJuliet for her amazing line-out prowess despite never having been lifted\nbefore. Special honours should go\nto Caitlin Jackson who pulled off a\nhat trick of tries within the space of\na single half and Lana Lee who successfully converted the majority of\ntries and who also scored a try on\nswitching from hooker to fly-half\ndue to injuries in the team.\nImperial have certainly started the\nseason on the best possible terms\nand though there are potentially\nsome tough matches yet to come,\nwe\u2019re confident we can build on the\nsuccess we had last year (winning the\nBUCS SE conference cup and finishing second in our division) and more\nrecently in order to achieve our best\nseason yet. If all of this sounds right\nup your street and you love rolling in\nthe mud, it\u2019s never too late to join us!\nHayley Rigby Sports Writer\n\n"

Band 1 is class-room based\nsubjects and include humanities and\nsocial sciences. Band 2 is laboratory\nbased subjects and applies to most of\nthe courses at Imperial, for example\nChemistry or Engineering.\nMedicine is broken up into pre-clini-cal and clinical medicine and for some\nuniversities there is a di\ufb00erence between the fees. Clinical medicine usually costs a great deal more than pre-clinical medicine and is consistently\nthe highest of the international fees.\nFor Band 2 subjects, Imperial charges their international students \u00a325,000\nwhich is followed by the University of\nCambridge which costs \u00a319,800. The\nlowest is \u00a310,600 from Queen Mary\u2019s\nUniversity.\nInternational fees are known to be\nsubstantially higher than Home students but this is due to the fact that\nthe government subsidises the fees for\nHome students.\nEuropean Union (EU) students also\ncount as Home students and pay the\nsame fees. Non-EU students count as\nInternational students, even if their\ncountry is in Europe but not a part of\nthe EU.\nAn anonymous biomedical student\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019d much rather pay less but then\ntaking into account the prestige, the\nenvironment and such things, I felt a\nlot more at home here than compared\nto Oxbridge. It\u2019s silly, I don\u2019t get why\nthey charge so much to be honest.\u201d\nCompared to Oxbridge, the raw\nfees for Imperial are still higher than\nboth Oxford andCambridge. However, Oxbridge have additional college fees(\u00a36157 for Cambridge and\n\u00a34500-5500 for Oxford) which means\nthat the overall costs of Oxbridge are\nhigher than Imperial. When the living\nexpenses of London are taken into ac-count, Imperial still comes out on top.\nA third year medical student, Minaal\nKhan said \u201cInternational fees are ridiculously high as everyone knows, but\nwhen applying I don\u2019t think I realised\nhow high they really were and I know\nit will take me over 10 years to make\nthe amount of money I have spent on\ncoming to university! But I don\u2019t regret\nchoosing this \ufb01eld because you can\u2019t\nput a price on the bene\ufb01ts that are\ngiven to me by having this education\u201d.\nAnother student, who wished to remain anonymous, replied: \u201cThere is\nno doubt that international students\nshould pay more as their places are not\nsubsidized by the government in any-way. However, I do not really see how\nthis comes to \u00a323,500 a year even in\ncomparison to new \u00a39, 000 home fees.\nIn addition, tuition fees keep going up\nevery year by a considerable amount as\nfor me this year ended up being over\na \u00a31000 more expensive than the last\none. We\u2019ll see what is there to come\nnext year.\u201d\nImperial College London were asked\nabout the fees and the reason for the\ndisparity, and replied with: \u201cWhen the\nInternational Recruitment team visits\noverseas schools, we are often asked\nwhy there is such a di\ufb00erence between\nHome and Overseas fees. Firstly, it is\nimportant to note that UK government\nstill partially funds Home and EU students at universities in England. Although with the new \u00a39000 fees Home\nand EU students are shouldering more\nof the \ufb01nancial burden of paying for\ntheir teaching than they were previ-ously, they are still not paying the full\ncosts of running the courses.\nThe reasons behind the disparities\nAverage Band 2 fees\nLondon Universities\n\u00a315,633\nAverage Clinical Medical fees\nLondon Universities\n\u00a329,566\nbetween Imperial\u2019s overseas fees and\nthose of our direct competitors are a\nbit more complex. Although London\nis a very expensive city, we are aware\nthat London is also home to some of\nour Russell Group colleagues whose\nfees di\ufb00er from ours. The bottom line\nis that the vast majority of Imperial\u2019s\ncourses are quite expensive to teach\ngiven our focus on STEM subjects,\nwhereas other multi-Faculty institutions o\ufb00er a variety of arts courses\nwhich can in e\ufb00ect subsidise the other\nFaculties. Being at a specialist university has many bene\ufb01ts however including excellent job prospects after grad-uation. We would hope that students\nsee the value in being part of such an\nelite technical institution and make\nthe most of their time with us by taking advantage of all the academic and\nnon-academic opportunities Imperial\nhas to o\ufb00er.\u201d\nAs has been previously reported in\nFelix, the job prospects for Imperial\ngraduates are very high compared to\ncompeting universities.\nAbove is a graph (just to remind you all of the wonders of Excel!) that was\nproduced by UniversitiesUK from a 2012-13 year survey of universities\u2019\nfees.

    "content": "\u201c\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n12\nou\u2019d think that \u2018antiwar\u2019 would be a pretty\neasy position to present,\nwouldn\u2019t you? When\nyou think of things that\nwe name Horsemen of the Apocalypse\nafter, it\u2019s not exactly a list of things that\nsplit opinion. There is no pro-Pestilence\nlobby. There is no Society for the Advancement of Famine. Famine especial-ly, Famine\u2019s a right dick. Keeps enough\nfood around to keep an undead horse\nrunning for all eternity, and then goes\naround taking away everyone else\u2019s din-ner? That\u2019s the sort of thing that makes\nit hard to run Horseman PR e\ufb00ectively.\nI digress. Of all the Horsemen that\nthe Bible mentions, War doesn\u2019t stand\nout as one that is particularly defensi-ble. When you look at his discography,\nit\u2019s a greatest hits list littered with more\ngenuine war crimes than the average\nEighties mix that used to pass for music\nin the Felix o\ufb03ce. Scientists being paid\nto research gases that shut down human\nrespiratory systems; mass acceptance\nof genocide and the killing of civilians;\nshady deals that prolong bloodshed and\nsu\ufb00ering in order to bene\ufb01t the few.\nWar is shit. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m\narguing this like it\u2019s a contentious posi-tion. Everyone knows that war is shit.\nOne of the things I respected over\nthe years was wearing poppies in November. For those of you who might\nbe spending their \ufb01rst November in\nthe UK, every year around this time we\nmake donations to a charity in exchange\nfor a bright red paper poppy, which we\npin onto our clothes in the days leading\nup to the 11th November \u2013 a special day\nmarking the end of World War One.\nPoppies became iconic largely thanks to\na poem describing the \ufb02owers that grew\nin the battle\ufb01elds of the \ufb01rst World\nWar, fertilised with the blood and gore\nof man\u2019s inhumanity to man. We wear\npaper versions of the blood-red \ufb02owers\nto remember the huge sacri\ufb01ces that\nwere made to \ufb01ght relatively morally-straightforward \ufb01ghts in defence of\npeople.\nThat was how it used to be. I\u2019d happily wear a \ufb02ower each and every year,\nbecause the two World Wars fought at\nthe start of the last century were really\nY\nRemembrance and regret\nRemembrance day is increasingly going against its original\nmeaning, argues Angry Geek\nshit ideas. Only a mounted dickbag like\nWar could come up with a concept so\nutterly stupid as the \ufb01rst one, and then\nfollow up with the worst second album\nanyone has ever seen. Why am I even\narguing this with you. There is no way\nanyone on this planet thinks those wars\nwere good ideas. That\u2019s why we wore\npoppies. That\u2019s why we fell silent every\nyear on the 11th November. That\u2019s why\nwe donate money to charity, to help out\nthe few soldiers that remain that fought\nin those wars, that o\ufb00ered themselves\nup to defend the world at large.\nBut things have changed. Understandably so in some ways \u2013 the charity behind the Poppy Appeal, the British Legion, have had to change tack as\nthe last few soldiers from World War\nOne pass away, and the veterans of\nWorld War Two begin to follow suit.\nNow they have a di\ufb00erent duty - to\nlook after the soldiers who fought in\nthe wars that came after, right up to\nthe ones we \ufb01nd ourselves in today.\nThat poses a problem, however. Where\nwe once fought wars against unspeakable evil, in genuine defence not just\nof our country but of all countries,\nwe now \ufb01nd ourselves being asked to\nremember and help out people who\nfought in far murkier wars. Wars further a\ufb01eld. Wars fought in pursuit of\nless noble goals. Wars we are told are\nbeing fought for our bene\ufb01t.\nThe shift in the advertising tone of\nthe Poppy Appeal, from one of remembrance and regret that war happens, to\none of optimism and support for the\n\u2018heroes\u2019 \ufb01ghting in modern arenas, is\none that will leave me behind. I won\u2019t\nbe wearing or buying a poppy this year,\nand nor should you. While the charity still does good work, the attitude it\nadopts and wishes us to adopt is not one\nthat is healthy. It is a sloppy mix of dark\npatriotism and an implied support of\nanything done by a soldier allied to the\nBritish army.\nThe reason we wore poppies, so I\nthought, was to remember that war is\nugly, unnecessary, and a last resort. Poppies were supposed to be a begrudging\nnod to the fact that War is a arsehole,\nnot a suggestion that his horse needs\na good stroke and a fresh saddlebag\nof mangled corpses to munch on. The\ncloser we get to associating Remembrance Day with condoning or supporting the actions of those who serve today,\nthe further we get from what I feel the\nceremony should really be about, and\nthe closer we come to being a country\nlike America, a nation of people who\nerupt in tear-\ufb01lled elation at the news\nof people being murdered by their nations\u2019s armed forces.\nWar is hell. Don\u2019t let anyone trick you\ninto thinking otherwise.\nThe reason\nwe wore\npoppies\n... was to\nremember\nthat war\nis ugly,\nunnecessary,\nand a last\nresort.\nCare about any of this?\nWrite for us!

    "content": "BOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\nThe Lathe of Heaven\nMaciej Matuszewski talks about Ursula Le Guin\u2019s masterpiece\nhere are few SF and fantasy authors who have\nwon as many awards as\nUrsula Le Guin. For over\n40 years she has been well\nknown for writing thought provoking,\nintelligent stories and she is fast becoming one of my favourite authors.\nHaving thoroughly enjoyed reading\nher Earthsea series of novels last year\nI decided to \ufb01nally try one of her science \ufb01ction o\ufb00erings and so turned to\nThe Lathe of Heaven.\nThe novel focuses on the life of\nGeorge Orr, a seemingly ordinary man\nwho has the ability to have so called\n\u201ce\ufb00ective dreams\u201d which can alter reality itself. Terri\ufb01ed of his abilities he\nplunges into depression and attempts\nto stop himself dreaming at all using\ndrugs, eventually being forced to see\npsychiatrist William Haber. While initially sceptical of Orr\u2019s abilities Haber\nslowly begins to believe that they can\nthey can be used to improve the dystopian world they live in, as well as to\nadvance his own position. A person\u2019s\ndreams, however, prove di\ufb03cult to\ncontrol and attempting to bend reality to one\u2019s will never has exactly the\nintended consequences.\nThis is a masterfully written novel.\nExploring complex issues of philoso-phy, ethics and the potentially destructive e\ufb00ects of an excess of ambition it\nremains readable and accessible, in no\nsmall part due to its short length. To\n\ufb01t all of these themes, as well as an\ninteresting plot and engaging charac-ters, in less than 200 pages without\nmaking the story feel rushed or forced\nis an amazing achievement.\nThe exploration of di\ufb00erent levels\nof consciousness and reality is somewhat reminiscent of the work of Philip\nK. Dick. Indeed, Dick himself greatly\npraised the book, saying: \u201cOne of the\nbest novels, and most important to\nunderstanding of the nature of our\nworld, is Ursula Le Guin\u2019s The Lathe\nof Heaven, in which the dream universe is articulated in such a striking\nand compelling way that I hesitate to\nadd any further explanation to it; it requires none.\u201d\nI personally believe that The Lathe\nof Heaven is far superior to much of\nDick\u2019s work. Le Guin never succumbs\nto the self-indulgence present in so\nmany of Dick\u2019s novels. Her work remains far more grounded \u2013 its meaning never obscured by impenetrable\npsychobabble or weirdness just for\nweirdness sake. As such, it remains so\nmuch more powerful a read.\nThis is a wonderful book that I can\nhonestly recommend to everybody,\neven those who don\u2019t usually like science \ufb01ction. A standalone master-piece, this is the perfect way to get\ninto Le Guin\u2019s work if you don\u2019t want\nto start with one of her longer series.\nT\nPenguin and Random House \u2013 the\nconsumer publishing divisions of\nPearson and Bertelsmann respectively \u2013 have recently announced\ntheir intention to merge, creating the world\u2019s biggest publishing\nhouse, duly named \u2018Penguin Random\nHouse\u2019.\nThe logistics of this union are sim-ple: Bertelsmann will own 53% of the\nnew publishing house to Penguins\n47%, this division being represented\nin the board room \u2013 Bertelsmann\nhaving \ufb01ve directors of the board to\nPenguins four with the contract lasting for at least three years. The merger makes Penguin Random House the\nlargest publisher in the world, publishing at least 25% of all books sold.\nWhat brought about the merger\nbetween two previously distinct en-tities? The threat of Amazon and\nApple, the purveyors of the e-book\n\u2018revolution\u2019, explains the decision\nto merge to an extent. Overall book\nsales in 2011 were down 11% and the\nreports for 2012 suggest a worsening\nof this downward trend. Of course,\nit is the e-book that has lead to the\nill health of the publishing industry.\nWith the threat from the digital sector only set to grow as more e-read-ers and tablets become available, the\nmerger between the two publishing\nhouses seems to only gain \ufb01nancial\ncredibility \u2013 though the e\ufb00ect it shall\nhave upon the rest of the industry\nremains debatable and largely un-predictable. Will the remaining publishers be squeezed into publishing\neven safer literature than is currently\navailable, or will they abandon the\ncentre ground that Penguin Random\nHouse shall straddle and instead\npublish new, innovative literature?\nWhen I say the word\nAntwerp, you are going to\nhave an effective dream...\nThe coming of the Random Penguin\nJoseph Spiking Writer\nThe situation may not be as bad as\nit seems. When Faber, an established\npublisher, enabled the independent\npublisher And Other Stories to produce a mass market edition of the\nMan Booker Prize nominated Swimming Home, they hit a gold mine:\nSwimming Home is one of the bestselling novels of this year.\nThis kind of co-operation between\nestablished and independent publishing houses may only increase, as\nestablished publishers will be driven\nto seek a niche that is not covered\nby Penguin Random House. This is\nnot only of great bene\ufb01t for those\nseeking original novels to consume,\nbut it may also provide fresh impetus for a \ufb02agging industry. Maybe the\nprinted novel shall have a happy ending after all.\n\n"

    "content": "First impressions: Halo 4\nLet me point this out before I start\n\u2013 I love the Halo universe and the\nprogression and impact the game\nseries has made within the indus-try. I remember picking up Halo: CE\nmany years ago and not having a PC\nthat could play it, faster than I could\ndraw the frames with a novelty pencil\nthe size of the Ei\ufb00el Tower. But I still\nplayed the hell out of it. The idea of an\narti\ufb01cial world, in the shape of a ring,\ncreated by an ancient and long-dead\nrace, worshipped by your mortal enemy and explored by a super-soldier\njust pushes all the right buttons in my\nbook. That being said, I never \ufb01nished\nit \u2013 the damn \ufb02ood can keep the li-brary. I never liked books anyway.\nSo, a quick future-history lesson for\nthose who\u2019ve continued past the \ufb01rst\nparagraph. In the 26th century, humanity is a space-faring race, having a\nstroll around the galaxy and creating\nsettlements all over the place, when it\nbumps into the Covenant. The Covenant declares war against humanity,\nciting that their gods don\u2019t like us. No\nmatch for the fervent and aggressive\nnature of the Covenant, humanity was\non a losing streak. On the frontlines\nof these battles were the Spartans \u2013\ngenetically engineered super-human\nsuper-soldiers, who wear kick-ass\narmour. You\u2019re one of them. Despite\nyour awesomeness, humanity was on\nit\u2019s last legs and the main bastion is\nEarth. You\u2019ve the original three Halo\ngames, covering the journey of Master Chief (a.k.a. John//Spartan-117)\nand his \ufb01ght to save Earth from the\nCovenant and the ancient parasitic\nlife-form known as the Flood. Charming name. Halo 3: ODST covers the\nexploits of an Orbital Drop Shock\nTrooper (ODST) squad that\u2019s been\nsent to clear up the covenant remnants\nafter their quick invasion of Earth (as\nseen in Halo 2) \u2013 no superpowers in\nsight \u2013 you\u2019re just regular squishy hu-mans. 2010 saw the release of Halo:\nReach, a prequel game, set before the\nevents of Halo: CE. As the original\nHalo series mentions the fall of Reach\noften, as you can guess, it doesn\u2019t end\nwell for anyone vaguely human. Let\u2019s\nnot talk about Halo Wars.\nPractically spoiler-free history lesson over, we\u2019re onto the main exhibit -Halo 4. As the numbering convention\nwould suggest, we\u2019re back with Master Chief, who was last seen sticking\nhimself in cryogenic suspension, after\nthe cruiser he was escaping on, was\ncut in half by a closing intra-dimen-sional portal, leaving him stranded. I\nwould\u2019ve been happy with leaving it\nthere \u2013 it allows for speculation, mov-ies, fan-work, you get the jist. Bungie,\nthe original creators of Halo up until\nnow, was disbanded and a new Microsoft studio took up the helm, with the\nname 343 Studios (343 Guilty Spark is\nthe name of the A.I. in charge of the\noriginal halo). There was quite a lot of\ndiscussion over why this studio-swap\nhappened and lots of people weren\u2019t\nhappy, claiming that they wouldn\u2019t be\nable to get the feel of Halo right. Well,\nI\u2019m glad to say, they were wrong.\nI\u2019ve only gotten about a quarter of\nthe way through the storyline (2/8\nchapters completed, according to the\ninfo boxes that pop up), so I can\u2019t give\na complete review of the game, yet.\nMore annoyingly, I can\u2019t spoil the\nwhole thing for you guys, as I don\u2019t\nknow the storyline myself. Even this\nfar in however, I\u2019m loving it. The engine has been heavily modi\ufb01ed since\nBungie\u2019s departure, and the whole\nlook and feel of Halo 4 is great. It\u2019s\nnot the dark and lonesome world\nof ODST, nor the bright and happy\nworld of Reach: the atmosphere of\nHalo 4 is a mixture of gloominess, but\nthere are also some wondrous moments as you come across large pieces\nof forerunner (the guys who made\nthe Halo system) technology and ar-chitecture, that make me want to sit\nthere and watch for hours. I have to\nkeep on reminding myself that I\u2019m\nstill playing on a 5 year old console \u2013\nit doesn\u2019t feel, or look like it.\nWeapons, armour and upgrades\nhave altered within the campaign. I\u2019m\nnot completely sure how your armour\nupgraded whilst you were in stasis\n(maybe I just missed that part), but\nthe new weapons I\u2019ve seen so far seem\na little... dull. The Covenant\u2019s storm ri\ufb02e seems to have replaced the trusty\nplasma ri\ufb02e, and the UNSC\u2019s SAM is\nsimply a weaker, less accurate, higher\nclip-size assault ri\ufb02e \u2013\u00ba not really my\nthing as I actually prefer to kill my\nenemies than tickle them. There will\nbe much jubilant crying and weeping\nwhen people realise that armour lock\nhas now vanished. The ha-ha-I\u2019mso-indestructible-that-even-a-nukecan\u2019t-touch-me-armour-lock has\nbeen replaced by a hard-light shield\nthat faces whatever way you\u2019re look-ing, and is able to block most small\narms \ufb01re.\nReach did something new for multiplayer \u2013 it gave you a recurring perso-na. You were a Spartan and you could\ncustomise your armour with hundreds of di\ufb00erent pieces. These pieces\nwere bought with XP and unlocked\naccording to your level, and I\u2019m very\nglad to see that it hasn\u2019t changed...\nmuch. Weekly and daily challenges\nare still around to give you more XP\nthan you can shake a gravity hammer\nat. I\u2019ve yet to play any proper amount\nof multiplayer, but it feels like Reach+\n\u2013 there are more options, more maps\nand just as many opportunities to assassinate people.\nSo for those of you still on the fence,\nI\u2019d say to get it. For those of you who\ndon\u2019t want to get it, I\u2019d say to get it. To\neveryone who has already bought it \u2013\nsee you on the battle\ufb01eld.\nRoss Webster That editor\u2019s a spy!\nGAMES\nTime, Dr. Freeman?\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have been in the test\nchamber half an hour ago?\u201d asks the\nscientist standing next to me. Quite\npossibly \u2013 I\u2019ve been running around\nthis lobby for the past 20 minutes\njust trying to see if I recognise any\nof the equations on the whiteboards.\nBetween the unresolvable scribbles,\nI think I might just have seen the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation!\nFor those clueless as to the context\nof my equation hunting, I\u2019m playing\nBlack Mesa: Source. It\u2019s a fan recreation of Valve\u2019s PC hit, Half-Life, which\nwas released in 1998. You are \u2018mute\u2019\nphysicist Gordon Freeman, whom\nwhilst at work at the Black Mesa\nResearch Facility, almost inadvertently creates the infamous Resonance\nCascade scenario. Since the entirety\nof the game was played from a \ufb01rst\nperson perspective (there were no\ncutscenes), the game was praised by\nmany for its immersion.\nBut anyway, perhaps it would be\nmore appropriate to label Black Mesa\nas a second attempt at Half-Life:\nSource; a direct port of the original\ngame released on Valve\u2019s then new\nSource engine in 2004. With few\nnew features and seemingly little improvement over the original game, it\nwas thought by some to be a lackluster e\ufb00ort by Valve. A group of fans of\nthe original took it upon themselves\nto develop a new remake using freely\navailable tools from the Valve\u2019s Steam\nplatform. True to Valve\u2019s normal development time frames, the game was\nreleased in a mostly complete form\neight years later, save for the \ufb01nal\nchapter.\nI\u2019m trying not to be accused of bias;\nhowever as a fan of the Half-Life series and other Valve games, it seems\nmy patience has paid o\ufb00. There is an\nattention to detail which will please\nfans of the original game, from the\nvarious control panels all the way\ndown to the weapons. There are a\nhandful of nice touches, with the on\nscreen HUD showing weapon ammo\nmuch like the original and new e\ufb00ects\ntoo. Anyone with fond memories of\nbackpedalling from hound-eyes\nwhilst frantically trying to reload will\nnot be disappointed. The soundtrack\nis also nice and refreshing; not a direct copy of the original, but a \ufb01tting\ninspiration.\nI do have a few criticisms though.\nDespite the fresh graphics, the mechanics of the game haven\u2019t really\nchanged much. I\u2019m not expecting\nthe latest cover-based shooter tactics\nsimilar to the Call of Duty series, but\nJosh Price Tomato-in-exile\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER 39\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nit\u2019s likely you will \ufb01nd yourself relying on quick-save quite often. The\nfamiliarity also makes it di\ufb03cult to\nplay sometimes, a few sections have\nbeen reworked, which hardcore fans\nmay \ufb01nd jarring. It should be noted\nthough, that it is technically based\nof the original game and not a direct\ncopy, so it is to be expected.\nPerhaps the most surprising thing\nof all is that the game exists at all, and\nis free to play. You might expect, that\ngiven complaints about heavy-handed\nattempts by publishers at enforcing\ncopyright, that such a project would\nbe squashed early on. However, Valve\nhave not only allowed the game, but\ninsist that it be distributed for free.\nThe original requirement of owning at\nleast one source engine game has also\nbeen dropped, and combined with the\nrecent approval on Steam Greenlight,\nmeans that it will appear in the Steam\nStore right next to the original game.\nSo, if you\u2019re at a loss for something\nto do on a Sunday afternoon, or you\nenjoyed the original game and its se-quels, it\u2019s worth a try. You can \ufb01nd it\navailable at http://release.blackme-sasource.com/. As the other scientist\nkindly reminded me; \u201cWe\u2019re waiting\nfor you Gordon, in the test chamber.\u201d\nSpartans never die. They play\nlegendary, rage-quit and throw\nthe controller at the screen.\n\n"

    "content": "Arealistictakeonroguelikes\nRobin Thomas reminisces back to when times were hard\npopular mod on the PC\ngaming scene, as many\nof us will know, is DayZ,\nwhere you get one shot\nat survival on an island\ncovered with zombies. It\u2019s hailed for\n\ufb01nally getting \u201csurvival\u201d right, with at-mosphere, realism and di\ufb03culty \u2013 and\nit\u2019s the di\ufb03culty that interests me.\nGames have been getting easier for\nyears. DayZ doesn\u2019t let you save and\nforces you to restart every time you\ndie, however, if your character somehow survives long enough for you\nto quit the server, you pick up where\nyou left o\ufb00. The \ufb01rst games to do per-madeath in a big way were \u2018roguelikes\u2019.\nWe have to look very far back to \ufb01nd\ntheir beginnings, as the \ufb01rst crop appeared in the 1970s with games such\nas Adventure, Dungeon and, in 1980,\nRogue, which the genre is named after.\nIn simple, relatable terms, imagine\nDiablo, but really, really hard. The average Roguelike has you make or randomly generate a character (with more\nchoices than you could shake a wand\nof wishing at) and dumps it in a walled\nvillage with a staircase down to a dun-geon. Levels are randomly generated,\nusually simply a series of pitch black\nrooms and corridors riddled with secret passages, traps, creatures and loot,\ndepending on how deep you\u2019ve delved.\nYour character must gain experience\nfrom monsters, travel down as far as\npossible, and kill some impossible boss\nat the deepest limit. Combat is roughly\nlike Dungeons & Dragons, so it is turn\nbased and requires a rulebook to properly understand. Oh, and most rogue-likes use ASCII graphics and don\u2019t take\nmouse input, in case you thought the\nabove sounded remotely accessible.\nThere is much variance between different versions, but the core game\nstays the same. Nethack, easily available on smartphones, is a straight-into-the-dungeon job, and generously\nprovides small sprite graphics. Larn\nfeatures a time limit and if you win ,\nyour subsequent characters get taxed.\nBrogue puts a lot of e\ufb00ort into making ASCII dungeons more colourful.\nMoria spawned many child-variants\nbased on Lord of the Rings lore. All of\nthem are completely unforgiving.\nSo what\u2019s actually good about them?\nVariety and randomness. My half orc\nbarbarian could take a sip from a water\nfountain on level one and be unlucky\nenough to get one-hit by the water demon that had a 1% chance of spawning from it. My elven ranger, however,\nmight make it down to the gnome and\ndwarf catacombs on level 5 thanks\nto his bow and come unstuck against\nsome tricky spellcasters. You could\nstart o\ufb00 as a wizard with a ring of in-visibility, only to die of hunger when\nparalyzed by a trap on level 19. You\nhave to take some amount of enjoyment from the inevitable death of your\ncharacter.\nOkay, \ufb01ne, you get what I\u2019m saying,\nbut games have moved on. We\u2019re used\nto hammering quick save and quick\nload to get the perfect hit for maximum experience, regular checkpoints,\nand having a player character that isn\u2019t\nan ampersand or \u201c@\u201d symbol. Why\ndon\u2019t you just play Diablo and actually\nhave fun rather than live in the past?\nI propose an alternate solution \u2013\nchoose the right variant, and cheat.\nYeah, I\u2019ve now been completely rejected by any hardcore roguelike players\n(who are still out there), but hear me\nout. Wizard mode is for \u201cdebugging\u201d,\nbut it allows you to simply respawn at\nthe start of any area you die. Combine\nthis with the variant ZangbandTK,\nbased on Angband, full of LotR characters and items as well as other hilarious easter eggs that become an\nintegral part of the game, plus dizzying character creation options. Most\nimportantly, it\u2019s got good sprite based\ngraphics, so you won\u2019t be squinting\nto see the di\ufb00erence between a wall\n(#) and a demonic quylthulg (%). The\ngame now becomes an exercise to create the best possible character from a\nrandom system, mostly done through\ngrinding quests with high level loot.\nBoy, that sounds familiar, doesn\u2019t it?\nZangbandTK is still brilliant fun if\nyou don\u2019t cheat, if not more. It\u2019s simply di\ufb03cult to bring this type of game\nto this generation. If you enjoy RPG\ngames, or simply like to think you\nknow a thing or two about the history\nof gaming, you owe it to yourself to\nexperience this genre as it is meant to\nbe. Even if you roll a gnome priest who\ndies at the hands of a lichen (yes, a li-chen) on the \ufb01rst level of the dungeon,\nyou\u2019ll catch a glimpse at what some of\ntoday\u2019s games are missing \u2013 a learning\ncurve with balls.\nA When I level up, I want to be\nChaos Bacon too! Sounds tasty.\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n38\nStrike team sent to upset UCL. Mission successful.\nMy Little Zergling DVD box set\nIt\u2019s been a question that has \ufb02oated\naround Imperial College Union\u2019s\nGaming Club for years now \u2013 why\ndon\u2019t we play anyone else? This year,\ngears actually started moving.\nOn Thursday evening, in a quiet area\nof UCL, pizza was delivered and the\nparty started. The LAN party. League\nof Legends (LoL), Team Fortress 2\n(TF2) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (CoD/MW3) were downstars,\nwhilst the revellers upstairs Brawl-ed\nand kicked a ball around in FIFA 13.\nThe event was well attended, even after the free food had vanished (about\n5 minutes in) and then the games\nbegan. Kinda. One of the UCL Tech\nSoc\u2019s new (I hesitate to say \u2018shiny\u2019 as\nit looked like it had been used to bu\ufb00\na pavement) Xbox 360s had broken,\nresulting in some slightly awkward\n2v2s., rather than the planned 4v4s.\nDespite that, Imperial beat UCL in all\nCoD games played, bar one (as their\nbest player had to leave after the \ufb01rst\ngame). LoL in the corner was dominated by the Imperial cohort, with\nthe UCL team conceding (read: rage-quitting) in the middle of the second\ngame, giving the Imperial team a 2-0\nmatch win. One stalwart Imperial\nstudent spent all day playing FIFA,\nwinning 5 out of the 6 games played\n(and only losing when it came to pen-alties) bringing great success to the\nmotherland.\nThere wasn\u2019t much success however,\nin the land of Super Smash Bros., with\nUCL wiping the \ufb02oor with us. Finally,\nTF2 \ufb01nished and the scores rolled in.\nHowever, all was not well in the land\nof in\ufb02atable unicorns and hats. The\nUCL view is that they slaughtered us,\nfair and square. The Imperial view is\nthat they slaughtered us, but cheated\nby bringing in someone with banned\nweapons and so UCL should be disquali\ufb01ed.\nRegardless of the rivalry, everyone\nwas still in high spirits at the end of\nthe day and wonderfully, not a single\nshout of \u2018n00b\u2019 rang throughout the\nbuilding.\nFor the \ufb01rst (of hopefully, many)\ntournament, things went surprisingly\nsmoothly and when it\u2019s time to host\nthe next evening, on the home turf,\nwe should have the food shortages,\nconsole shortages, UCL rage-quitting\nshortages and \u201cImperial won\u201d shortages \ufb01xed.\nWhen the date and time are known,\nit\u2019ll be posted up on the Imperial College Union Gaming Club\u2019s Facebook\ngroup and you can put your name in\nfor the Imperial team, for the games\nof your choice.\nTl;dr: Imperial possibly beat UCL at\na bunch of video games, with a score\nof 2-1 or 3-2. Or maybe we drew with\n2-2 - I don\u2019t know. Just read the arti-cle.\nUCL players in a variety\nof stages of loser\u2019s grief...\n.... and this is why. (No it wasn\u2019t\njust him. We\u2019re not that good.)\n\n"

    "content": "The best films from the 1960s\nJohn Park Film Editor\n10. The Lion in Winter (1968)\nA sharp, bitter, long-term family feud\nsets the screen ablaze as the historical drama focusing on Richard II, his\nimprisoned wife Eleanor, and his sons\nbring up all sorts of dirt, back-stab-bing, shifting allegiances, and neverending plotting. It\u2019s wonderfully writ-ten, with each insult to one another\nperfectly devised and packing in lots\nof punch. And of course, there\u2019s the\nfantastic cast. Headed by the loud,\nlarger-than-life Peter O\u2019Toole and\nacid-tongued Katharine Hepburn,\nthis also is a superb \ufb01lm debut for the\ngreat Sir Anthony Hopkins.\n9. What Ever Happened to\nBaby Jane? (1962)\nYes, what DID happen to Baby Jane\nHudson (Bette Davis)? Once a popular\nchild star, she is now an ageing \ufb02op of\nan \u201cactress\u201d living in the worn-down\nfamily home paid for by her more successful but now wheelchair-bound\nsister, Blanche (Joan Crawford). The\ntwo biggest divas of Hollywood command your attention in their power-ful, and in Davis\u2019 case, hysterically\nover-the-top performances. It\u2019s dis-turbing, but also deliciously fun as it\nembraces its campy, gothic vibe.\nRecently, the British Film Institute\n(BFI) released the results of their\ncelebrated poll, \u201cTHE GREATEST\nFILMS OF ALL TIME\u201d, in which they\nsurveyed \ufb01lm critics and directors to\nlist their ten favourite \ufb01lms. Now the\nFelix Film team, as much as we\u2019d love\nto, doesn\u2019t have that kind of time or\nresources. And so we decided to split\nthe \ufb01lms up according to the decades\nin which they were released. So every\nweek, we will present you with our\ntop \ufb01lms of each decade.\n8. Cool Hand Luke (1967)\nIt\u2019s a true showcase for Paul Newman\u2019s\ntalent playing the cheeky, rebellious\nprisoner who becomes the hero and\ninspiration to his fellow inmates. It\u2019s\nfull of unforgettable moments (New-man gobbles down 50 hard-boiled\neggs in an hour for a bet), resonant dialogue (\u201cwhat we\u2019ve got here is failure\nto communicate\u201d spoken by the sickeningly snarky Strother Martin) and\na \ufb01tting but tragic end. The rest of the\ncast is faultless to say the least, and so\nis the genuine plausibility of the often\nruthless nature of corrupt hierarchy\nand forced injustice.\n7.2001:ASpaceOdyssey(1968)\nA genre-de\ufb01ning \ufb01lm, many consider Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-\ufb01 space\nadventure \ufb01lm, which is quite the\nunderstatement when it comes to describing the scope and scale of what\u2019s\non o\ufb00er here, as one of the greatest\n\ufb01lms of all time. From its powerful\nopening it shows no signs of playing\ndown its bold ideas. Featuring one of\ncinema\u2019s most terrifying villains, the\nmother of all things evil and robotic,\nthe special e\ufb00ects are electrifying,\nand the score, astounding. A \ufb01lm of\nunimaginable scale and ambition, it\u2019s\ncertainly one of the most iconic.\n6. La Dolce Vita (1960)\nFederico Fellini is by no means everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but there is no denying the Italian director\u2019s extraordinary vision when it comes to the\nmuch-mentioned neo-realism. Running at almost 3 hours, it\u2019s a draining\nwatch, as we follow a week in a journalist\u2019s (Marcello Mastroianni) life as\nhe tries to \ufb01nd love and happiness often to very little avail. The sad decline\nof his surroundings (i.e. Rome) and its\nmoral decay are captured beautifully,\nand Swedish actress Anita Ekberg\u2019s\nwalk in the Trevi Fountain is the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s most stylish scene.\n5. Bonnie and Clyde(1967)\nNo-one thought this would be a suc-cess. Many were repulsed by the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nfrank attitude towards sex and violence.\nBut this was a cinematic sensation\nworldwide which let actor/producer\nWarren Beatty walk away with a hefty\nsum of cash. Based on the true story of\nthe two titular lovers and bank robbers\nmaking a name for their antics during\nthe Great Depression, it has romance,\nviolence, and heart. The sultry and\ncharismatic Faye Dunaway makes her\nwinning debut here, a high-pro\ufb01le role\nthat sky-rocketed her career in the \ufb01lm\nindustry.\n4. Dr. Strangelove (1964)\nYet another Stanley Kubrick entry\nhere and this time it\u2019s a political sat-ire, and possibly the funniest you\u2019ll\never see in your lifetime, which is a\nreal surprise from someone who is\nnot generally considered a top director of the comedy genre. Taking humourous passes at the Cold War and\nits nuclear missile crises, it bene\ufb01ts\nenormously from having the great\nPeter Sellers take on three principal\nroles in the \ufb01lm, as characters who\ntry so hard to be serious in the delicate times of war fail miserably in\ntheir attempts to remain credible.\n3. The Apartment (1960)\nThis has the rare distinction of being\none of the very few comedy \ufb01lms to\nhave walked away with the Best Picture award at the Oscars, and it\u2019s an\nhonour that is completely well-de-served. As it delicately probes around\nthe sensitive subject matter of sex and\nin\ufb01delity, movie legend Billy Wilder\n\ufb01nds the space and time to centre it\nall around the developing romance\nbetween a lowly o\ufb03ce drone (Jack\nLemmon) and an elevator operator\n(Shirley MacLaine). It\u2019s darker than\nyou might think, but ultimately delightful nonetheless.\n2. Psycho (1960)\nSome would argue vehemently\nagainst this but to me here is the best\n\ufb01lm Hitchcock has ever directed.\nSlowly mounting tension from the\nget-go, we get the chilling shower\nscene to set the creepy tone, and\nevery time Norman Bates (the excellent Anthony Perkins) shows his face\naccompanied by that high-pitched\nsoundtrack, it\u2019s enough to send shivers down the spine. And who can forget the demented conclusion? Daring\nfor its time of release with none of\nthe haunting factor lost even to this\nday, Hitchcock\u2019s legacy will live on.\n1. Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\nThis is the epic of epics, a true grand\nmasterpiece in \ufb01lmmaking. Director\nSteven Spielberg loves it so much he\nwatches it every time he\u2019s about to direct another \ufb01lm. It\u2019s just that good.\nAnd endlessly watchable. This is Peter\nO\u2019Toole at his \ufb01nest, his eyes at their\nbluest, Omar Shari\ufb00 at his most char-ismatic, and director David Lean at\nhis most ambitious. Like most grand\nspectacles to come out of Hollywood,\nit has a sizable length (running time),\nas well as a star-studded cast who\nare tossed into incredible scenes of\nbreathtaking action sequences.\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36 FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n\n"

    "content": "The Science in the Series\nAstrid Armgarth has a nerdy fascination with Bones\necently, I read an interesting article about outraged nerds demanding\na change of the outdated\nde\ufb01nition of the term\nnerd. As it stands, the o\ufb03cial translation according to the Oxford English\nDictionary is \u201ca foolish or contemptible person who lacks social skills or\nis boringly studious\u201d. At a university\nsuch as this there is no shortage of\nnerds or people that may be considered boringly studious. Most Imperial students would probably join in\nthis uproar against old-fashioned terminology that fails to convey the full\nmeaning of what it means to be a nerd!\nBut the couch is simply too comfort-able. Another, easier way of showing\nyour support to this cause is to simply\nwatch the right shows. As the number of viewers of nerd-approved TVseries rise, our in\ufb02uence expands until\n\ufb01nally nerds overthrow the market\n(and inherit the earth). By then someone with \u201cmore social skills\u201d is bound\nto have presented our case for us.\nBut be aware, the untrained nerd\nmight be drawn to watch fake-nerd\nshows. These are in actuality merely\nhipster-approved. A good example of\nsuch false advertisement is the show\nNew Girl, starring Zooey Deschanel.\nThis series \ufb01ts under the outdated\ntranslation of nerd, as the main character in fact is a foolish and contemptible person. This proves just how hip it\nis to be a nerd, since even hipsters try\nto mimic our lifestyle but alas fail.\nThe beginning of true nerd-series\nstarted early on and focused mainly\non science \ufb01ction, with Star Trek being the most obvious example. But\nthere has been a second coming of the\nnerds on TV in which the spot light is\non science and not science \ufb01ction. For\nthe award of the best original series\nof the second nerd-era I would like\nto nominate Bones. This show started\nin 2005, which was notably two years\nprior to the big bang of The Big Bang\nTheory.\nBones is still going strong as its 8th\nseason brings on new murder crimes\nthat can only be solved by the forensic\nanthropologist Dr. Temperance Brennan, aka Bones, and her invaluable\nteam. The role of the highly intelligent\nand socially awkward main character\nis well played by Emily Deschanel,\nwho coincidentally is the older sister of the previously trashed actress.\nFor those of you who are new to this\nshow, Bones is simply put a female\nversion of Sheldon Cooper in The\nBig Bang Theory, as she constantly\nand brutally reminds her co-workers\nabout their intellectual inferiority.\nEquipped with empirical reasoning\nand intimate knowledge of bones,\nshe studies the remains of victims\nand deducts the cause of death. Her\ncounterpart is the emotional and temperamental FBI Special Agent Seeley\nBooth, starring David Boreanaz. The\ncentral theme in the early seasons\nrevolves around the sexual tension\nbetween Bones and Booth, which\nreaches its pinnacle in season 5. After\nthat point the viewers can be expected\nto be slightly disappointed if they were\nonly interested in this couple.\nLuckily, viewers need not fret as\nBones has a full nerd squad by her\nside, known as squints. These supporting actors impressively demonstrate the wonders of interdisciplinary\nscience, but more importantly brings\nhumor and additional relationship\nintrigues to the show. There is the\n\u201cbug and slime\u201d guy, Hodgins, who is\nfanatical about the insects that infest\nvictim remains. He is partnered with\nAngela, the group\u2019s self-trained computer wiz and reconstruction artist.\nTheir boss, Cam, deals with matters of\nthe \ufb02esh, whereas the FBI psychologist Dr. Sweets deals with matters of\nthe mind, or \u201csoft sciences\u201d as Bones\ncalls it. In addition there are plenty of\nfunny intern squints that are replaced\non a seasonal basis, which makes every episode unique.\nAs with most nerd-shows, the depiction of science is not always cor-rect. The cleanliness of the Smithsonian laboratory clearly shows ignorance\nof the chaos most scientists are used\nto. But they do get some things right \u2013\nHodgins likes to blow things up in the\nname of science as we all do at Imperial. This quirky show shines a light on\nscience and the vast variety of nerds\nwithout coming across as boring or\nstudious.\nR\nAs you may have noticed, the TV page\nhas a new addition in the form of a feature called \u2018My Top Five Episodes of the\nWeek.\u2019Thetitleisprettyself-explanatory, I think, but just so there is no confusion this list will contain an individual\u2019s\n\ufb01ve favourite episodes from that week.

    "content": "Return of the Rebels\nMUSIC\nJeni Pillai gives Peace a chance\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n33\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\nAMS album of the week\nNeil Young: AftertheGoldRush\nSo last Thursday i had the good fortune to visit the Electric Brixton for\nthe \u2018Return of the Rebels\u2019 tour. The\nset included Harlem based rappers\nSwave Sevah, Mazzi, Poison Pen and\nDj Static, one of UK\u2019s \ufb01nest namely\nLowkey, and the main event himself\nwas Immortal Technique. Those\nwho know who he is and have heard\nhis music will probably realise that it\nmust have been an incredible gig. And\nboy it was.\nI should say a little bit about the ven-ue. Not familiar with the Brixton area,\nI thought it was the O2 Brixton just\nunder new management, but it wasn\u2019t.\nFormerly The Fridge, Electric has undergone a major \u00a31,000,000 facelift\nand is set to become the latest state of\nthe art music venue to open in London, hosting both DJs and live acts.\nIt really was an intricate and intimate\narena, which wasn\u2019t overcrowded and\nyet felt full of energy. A quick visit to\nthe website will provide pictures, videos and a list of interesting upcoming\nevents, including Sub Focus in December.\nSome probably saw the word \u2018rapper\u2019\nand turned the page, but for those still\nreading everyone knows the rap/hip-hop genre is not universally approved\nof. And some of the mainstream crap\nwith no musical ability coming out\nthese days (yes you, Drake) doesn\u2019t\nhelp. As a lover of lyricism and word-play, quality has gone down in my\nopinion over the years, along with the\nconcept of \u201csocially conscious hiphop\u201d, which even prompted Nas to\nrelease an album called \u201cHip-Hop is\nDead\u201d.\nSo when I heard some of Immortal Technique\u2019s stu\ufb00 back in 2005, I\nwas amazed. In his \ufb01rst two albums\nRevolutionary Vol. 1 and Revolutionary Vol.2, he attacks capitalism and\nthe power of corporations, the \ufb02awed\npower structure in America, life on the\nstreets, drug trade, slave labour, media\nbias, going to jail and even philosophic\nideas. If you don\u2019t like the angry/pas-sionate tone associated with hip-hop\nand rap, I strongly advise at least reading the lyrics if not listening to the\nmusic. His standing as a revolutionary is increasing rapidly worldwide,\nand rightly so. And he doesn\u2019t just\ntalk the talk; in June 2008, Immortal\nTechnique partnered with Omeid International, a non-pro\ufb01t human rights\norganization, to lend his support. He\ndubbed the work as \u201cThe Green Light\nProject\u201d. With the pro\ufb01ts of The 3rd\nWorld album, Immortal Technique\ntraveled to Kabul, Afghanistan to help\nOmeid build an orphanage without\nany corporate or external funding.\nThe orphanage, having been successfully established, currently houses\nover twenty orphaned children from\nKabul. (A lot of ass-kissing I know..)\nThe other stand-out was Lowkey.\nHe is described as a poet, playwright,\npolitical activist and award winning\nHip-Hop Artist of mixed British and\nArab descent who has received airplay on numerous major radio stations including BBC Radio 1, Capital\nFM, Kiss 100, Choice FM, BBC 1Xtra\nand BBC Asian Network, and toured\ninternationally, performing to crowds\neverywhere from Glastonbury to\nTrafalgar Square, Germany to Amsterdam. Lowkey also records duets\nwith another rapper called Logic as\npart of their non-pro\ufb01t organisation\nThe People\u2019s Army, aimed at raising\nawareness of infant \ufb01ghting in Israel\nand Palestine. His album Soundtrack\nto the Struggle in 2011 was met with\nwidespread acclaim, a key track being\n\u2018Voices of the Voiceless\u2019 featuring Immortal Technique. The two combined\non stage to perform the song, which\nreceived the biggest cheer of the night.\nThe other three were pretty me-diocre, mainly because it was nigh on\nimpossible to hear anything they were\nsaying, which is sometimes a problem\nin live hip-hop concerts. The biggest\ncheer they got was when one shouted\nout, \u201cWhere my weed smokers at?\u201d\nAll in all, it was \u00a320 well spent, and\nas Technique said to \ufb01nish o\ufb00 with,\n\u201cSomeone once said that Hip Hop is\ndead. Well today you just saw a living\nghost. Vive la r\u00e9volution!\u201d\nPriyank Shah Writer\nYou might be wondering why the AMS are talking about Neil Young. You might be thinking,\nNeil Young\u2019s not cool, he\u2019s not relevant, he\u2019s just\nsome shit old country singer that nobody cares\nabout anymore. I used to be like you. I always\nhad this preconception of him as bland and un-inspiring.TheStatus Quoofsinger-songwriters.\nThe Ben Howard of the 60s (yeah, I went there).\nThen, a few months ago, whilst going through a list of \u2018the greatest albums of all\ntime\u2019, I decided to actually listen to After the Goldrush. It turns out he\u2019s amazing.\nHe\u2019s not even particularly country. His career is ridiculously varied, I mean, the\nman (kind of) invented grunge. Some of his albums are, very rightly, considered\namongst the greatest ever written. Honestly, he\u2019s really worth a listen. Give him a\ngo. I\u2019d personally suggest On the Beach as the ideal starting place, but After the\nGoldrush is also fantastic.\nI should probably talk about the album a bit. It\u2019s another collaboration with his\nintermittent backing band Crazy Horse. It\u2019s 90 minutes of noise drenched psychedelic hard rock. It\u2019s great. From the first track to the last it\u2019s a really interesting\nlisten. It is a double album, so of course there are bits which feel a little extrane-ous, but the vast majority is really good. The album is full of brave decisions, such\nasmakingthefirstsonga28minuteswirlingpsychedelicjam.Normally,ifaband\nopened an album with such a long song, I\u2019d be highly abusive. It shouldn\u2019t work,\n28 minute songs should be put at the end an album, or ideally, the bonus disc\nthat I will never ever listen to. However, here, it completely works. It fits into the\nethos of the whole thing. Neil Young doesn\u2019t care about what music should be.\nHe has a voice you could shave boulders with. Neil Young does whatever the hell\nhe wants, and he\u2019s a good enough songwriter that it (usually) works.\nIt\u2019s obviously not his best album, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend starting\nwith it. However, it is the best new album I\u2019ve heard in a good few months and\nfor those of you who are already Neil Young fans, I\u2019d definitely recommend it.\nStuart Masson\nAt \ufb01rst glance, Peace appear to be\nyet another so-cool-it-hurts, indier-than-thou, guitar band. Just have a\nlook at their haircuts and you\u2019ll see\nwhere I\u2019m going with this. But after\nseeing them play at the Lexington on\nTuesday night, I can con\ufb01rm there\u2019s\nde\ufb01nitely more to them than that.\nThey stormed straight out of Birmingham this year, along with bands\nlike Swim Deep and Troumaca, to\nintroduce the London music scene to\na sound that it hasn\u2019t heard in a while.\nI\u2019d even go so far as to say that it\u2019s\ncomparable to the Grunge movement\nin the mid-80s, of which Peace are the\nequivalent to Nirvana. Big statement,\nI know, but listen to the EP and you\u2019ll\nget it. No but seriously, LISTEN TO\nTHE EP. It\u2019s one of the most exciting\n(and delicious) things to come out this\nyear and if the debut album (expected\nto be released in the Spring of next\nyear) is anywhere near as good as the\nEP we\u2019re in for a treat.\nBefore the band took to the stage, a\n5-piece from Cambridge called Carousels played their set. The combination of their lo-\ufb01 sound and soothing\nmale-female dual vocals produced\nsomething that wasn\u2019t easily forgetta-ble, as so many support acts are. However, there were some issues with the\nsound that meant it was a real struggle to hear the vocals over the guitar.\nI have no idea what they were singing\nabout. They certainly made an impression though, judging by the rush\nof people clambering over each other\nto grab the EPs they were selling at the\nback of the room.\nPeace started their set with \u2018Ocean\u2019s\nEye\u2019, a song with all the roguish charm\nand twanging guitars you could want\nfrom a good old indie record. It\u2019s when\nthey played \u2018Follow Baby\u2019, one of their\nmost popular tracks, that we got more\nof an idea about what sets Peace apart\nfrom the rest. The slurring, scratchy\nvocals coupled with the screeching\nguitar injected the room with a massive shot of adrenaline. There was\nsomething about being in the midst of\na crowd of hipsters chanting the line\n\u201cwe gonna live forever baby\u201d that did\nfeel slightly surreal. \u2018Li\u2019l Echo\u2019, the Bside to \u2018Follow Baby\u2019, has a haunting\ntone to it that rings in your ears long\nafter it\u2019s \ufb01nished and suddenly made\nthe gig feel even more intimate. Then\n\u2018California Daze\u2019 provided a change in\nmood; calm descended and I genuinely thought we\u2019d have to get our lighters\nout and wave them in the air at some\npoints.\nThe highlight of the night for me\nwas when they launched into \u20181998\u2019,\na cover of the Binary Finary track of\nthe same title. It \ufb01zzled into a massive\nPink Floyd-esque jam at the end and,\nat the risk of sounding clich\u00e9 (which\nin itself is a clich\u00e9, ha), I have to admit it was quite magical. Everyone just\nseemed completely mesmerised by\nwhat was going on on-stage, and that\u2019s\npretty rare because jams like this can\nfeel so indulgent the crowd loses inter-est. Not this jam. This was a good jam.\nTo \ufb01nish the set, they played \u2018Bloodshake\u2019, a song reminiscent of an early\nFoals improv\u2019 with Harry (Harrison\nKoisser, singer) drawling \u201cwe spit\nblood in the sun, we spit blood in the\nocean\u201d over it. There\u2019s a bit near the\nend that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place\nin an xx song as well, so they\u2019ve covered all bases there. It\u2019s a \ufb01rm favourite with the band\u2019s fast-growing fanbase and, along with the white confetti\nthat exploded over our heads, created\nthe perfect \ufb01nale to the show.\nPeace are a band that seem to be\ngrowing exponentially (had to drop\nthat in, we\u2019re at Imperial guys, embrace it). They\u2019ve certainly come a\nlong way since I saw them supporting the Mystery Jets earlier this year.\nThe grungy yet elegant atmosphere of\nthe Lexington provided the perfect\nenvironment for Peace\u2019s grungy yet\nelegant sound. They say they make\nmusic to \u201cfuck you in the heart\u201d. After\nTuesday night, I kind of agree.\nJeni Pillai Writer\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14 FRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\nnybody who has ever\nseen The History Boys,\nwhether on stage or on\nscreen, will remember the moment when\nIrwin, that world-wise and world-weary teacher, turns round to his pupils observing a monument to fallen\nsoldiers and says: \u201cAll this mourning\nhas veiled the truth. Because you\nshould realise... there\u2019s no better way\nof forgetting something than by commemorating it.\u201d But whilst I\u2019m a huge\nfan of Alan Bennett\u2019s play otherwise,\nI couldn\u2019t disagree more with this\nstatement. Moreover, it saddens me\nthat so many people choose neither to\nmourn, nor commemorate, on what\nI see as one of the most important\ndates in our calendar: Remembrance\nDay.\nAnd it\u2019s almost funny, how whilst\nI\u2019m certain my 10 year old brother\n(who has only thoughts of FIFA 12 on\nhis mind) will be standing at 11 o\u2019clock\nin the middle of some school yard,\nsurrounded by three or four hundred\nother boys and girls (who for sure do\nnot have anything more profound than\nFIFA 12 on their minds), all sni\ufb04ing\nand knocking their knees together in\nthe bitter cold whilst some pompous\nred-nosed headmaster calls them to\nattention, sounds the bugle and bullies them into a minute\u2019s worth of si-lence, my 11am on 11/11/12 will be as\nunremarkable as the 11am of the day\nbefore, or the day before that. No one\nshall force me to pause my day for 60\nseconds. No one will take to a brass\ninstrument to squawk out some pitiful notes. No one will recite \u2018They shall\ngrow not old, as we that are left...\u2019 and\nplace a wreath.\nNo. My lecturer will do none of\nthose things. \u201cAnd WHY NOT?!\u201d I\nwant to ask. Let\u2019s be honest here, if I\ndon\u2019t do as well as I\u2019d hoped in my end\nof year exams (or God forbid, fail them\noutright), it won\u2019t be because 8 months\nbefore that a Professor stopped what\nhe was saying, lowered his glasses and\nlooked up at the room to say: \u201cBoys\nand girls, I want us to take a minute\nto think, to REALLY think about the\nincredible sacri\ufb01ce some people not\nso unlike you or me gave some tens of\nyears ago so that you can be here now,\nA\nA call to remembrance\nrecovering from last night\u2019s hangover\nin this stu\ufb00y lecture theatre, safe in the\nknowledge that outside of it is a free\ncountry. That your lives are free from\nfear. That you won\u2019t be persecuted for\nbeing the \u2018wrong\u2019 race or religion, nor\ncome home to \ufb01nd a relative missing\nbecause they said the \u2018wrong\u2019 thing out\nloud. That you won\u2019t, in your majority,\never experience the horrors of war.\u201d\nGranted, Remembrance Day this\nyear falls on a Sunday, so if I\u2019m sitting\nin a lecture theatre then, I really will\nquestion whether I live in a free coun-try. But last year and the year before\nthat it didn\u2019t, and no one interrupted a\nsnoozing room then to announce that\nit was in fact, the 11th hour of the 11th\nday, etc etc.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m one of the\nmost politically obtuse people I know.\nI don\u2019t religiously watch Question\nTime every Thursday evening (or in\nfact, at all), and whilst I was distressed\nby the proposed rise in tuition fees,\nmine was not a face that you could\nhave found at the street protests. But I\ndo \ufb01ercely \u2018mind\u2019 that with each passing year, it seems that fewer and fewer\npeople care about paying homage and\nrespect to (or even just re\ufb02ecting on)\nthe vast number of men and women\nwho su\ufb00ered unspeakable brutalities,\nultimately for our sakes. We can argue\nfor hours over whether commemorating with all those wreaths and all those\npoppies actually does anything, but it\u2019s\nunquestionable that in making no effort whatsoever to commemorate the\ndeaths of those who gave up their lives\nfor our freedoms, we are in e\ufb00ect trivi-alising their sacri\ufb01ce.\nWhich is why I want to appeal to you.\nTo you, the reader of this piece who\nhas made it this far down the page. To\nyou who also thinks that the signi\ufb01cance of Remembrance Day shouldn\u2019t\ndissolve in our minds. To you who realises that just because you may never\nhave met somebody, it doesn\u2019t mean\nthat their actions and their bravery are\nworth forgetting about.\nPlease, buy a poppy to show that you\ncare. Wear it with pride and tell someone else about why you\u2019re doing it. Or\njust take a minute out of your busy day\nto think and to Remember: it\u2019s the very\nleast you can do.\nMargot Pikovsky despairs at the College\u2019s apathy\nUnited States of Eurasia\nThe college\u2019s Europe-centric approach to overseas study is something we should change.\nDoug Hunt\nne of my manifesto\npoints was that there\nneeds to be more non-European study abroad\nopportunities as part\nof our undergraduate degrees. I believe this because when you benchmark some Imperial departments\nagainst others you will see some have\nthe University of California and the\nUniversity of Melbourne as partners,\nwhile others only have partners inside\nEurope.\nFurthermore, when you compare\ncertain departments to others at rival\ninstitutions that we compete with for\nUCAS applications, we are far behind\nthem with respect to our partners\noutside Europe. One example is that\nthe Biochemistry, Physics, Chemistry\nand Mathematics courses at UCL offer a chance to study at Caltech (the\nuniversity the Big Bang Theory show\nis set), while chemistry at Imperial is\nthe only department within the Faculty of Natural Sciences with study\nabroad partners outside Europe \u2013\nEmory University (Atlanta, Georgia,\nUSA) and Nanyang Technological\nUniversity (Singapore).\nSo if Imperial is supposed to be one\nof the top 10 institutions in the world\n(according to both the QS and Times\nHigher Education world rankings),\nthen why do not all departments offer these study abroad placements\naround the globe at other world class\ninstitutions? And why are Imperial\u2019s\ncompetitors o\ufb00ering these opportuni-ties, while we seem content with the\nones we currently o\ufb00er?\nAs you can see this is something I\nfeel passionately about, but I need to\nmake sure I am not being delusional\nand I am doing my job by representing\nyour views. To make sure I am being\na good DPE, I have set up the one-o\ufb00\nInternational Mobility Survey that\nwill start next Monday and you can \ufb01ll\nit in via www.imperialcollegeunion.\nimsurvey. You also have the chance of\nwinning a Kindle Fire - not bad for less\nthan \ufb01ve minutes work!\nThis will not just focus on study\nabroad options but also whether Imperial should be o\ufb00ering more funded\nsummer research placements around\nthe world. Something MIT has been\ndoing since 2009, branded under the\nname of MISTI and has proven popular with their undergraduate cohort.\nI am not going to spend forever giving reasons to why I think more international opportunities outside Europe\nshould be given to our students, but\nhere are a few I want to leave you with:\n- Some current and potential prospective students aren\u2019t willing to\nlearn a language in order to carry out\nan exchange programme. This can\nlead to potentially disgruntled students and Imperial missing out on\ntalented undergraduates to our com-petitors.\n- A competitive year abroad scheme\nacts as an incentive for undergraduates to work harder within their \ufb01rst\n2 or 3 years of their degree, which I\nbelieve will lead to a better quality of\nImperial graduates.\n- To help Imperial\u2019s international\nreputation grow, graduates now need\nto be internationally mobile.\n- According to a recent British\nCouncil Survey: 54% of 18 -24 year-olds feel their career prospects would\nhave been better if they had studied or\nworked abroad.\nO\nDeputy President\n(Education)\nMargot Pikovsky\n\n"

The capital\u2019s largest\npan-city festival, this two week a\ufb00air\ncomprises hundreds of events spanning dozens of venues.\nGlancing at the range of the bands\nplaying this year reveals that the days\nof \u2018jazz tradition\u2019 are long gone. One\nwould be hard-pressed to distil many\ncommon themes from the characteristics of the groups performing over\nthe next two weeks, given the breadth\nof their in\ufb02uences, the seemingly unlikely genre fusions, and the widespread propensity to push boundaries in every conceivable direction.\nWith some of the more well known\nperformers long since sold out, here\nare my \u201calternative picks\u201d of the festival - just a few those groups who I\nfeel are leading jazz in exciting new\ndirections.\nTonight (9th) sees a triple bill of\nup-and-coming Norwegian artists at\nVortex. Bushman\u2019s Revenge whose\ngenre bending sound has been described as \u201cmoving between jazz\nand classic heavy rock \u2026 with traces\nof blues, prog and acid rock\u201d will be\njoined by Rune Grammofon labelmates Albatrosh, a dynamic piano/\nsaxophone duo who e\ufb00ortlessly blend\nstrong compositional and melodic\nnous with elements of near-telepathic\nfree-improvisation. Rounding out the\nMatt Earnshaw looks ahead to this year\u2019s London Jazz Festival\nline up are Synkoke, self described as\n\u201cpunked prog-jazz\u201d, their no-holds-barred approach is a modern take on\nthe style pioneered by groups such as\nPeter Br\u00f6tzmann\u2019s Last Exit. Not\nfor the faint of heart!\nAward-winning Finnish experi-mentalists Oddarang (Southbank\nCentre, 10th, free) blend their unique\nstrain of jazz with in\ufb02uences from\nworld music, classical, and post-rock\nto create moving, minimalist soundscapes set against a gently propulsive\nrhythm section and ethereal melo-dies, whose overarching aesthetic has\nbeen likened to the works of Icelandic group Sigur R\u00f3s.\nOne-man band Hyperpotamus\n(11th, Artsdepot, free) produces music using only his voice and a loop\npedal, both singing and using wordless vocalisation to provide rhythmic and melodic lines, and creating\ntechnically impressive multi-layered\ncompositions.\nThe talented, young, London \ufb01vepiece Psylus (13th, Southbank Centre, free) melds contemporary bop-ish themes and free improvisation\nwith elements of hip-hop and elec-tronica, to create a refreshingly creative sound that is poised to become\na success on the international jazz\nscene.\nLondon\u2019s World Service Project\n(16th, Vortex) use their tight, groovy\nrhythm section as a basis for trumpet\nand sax to lock horns in lively conversation over liquid time-changes and a\ndanceable funk-laden beat. Supporting them are Norwegian indie-jazz\nensemble Pixel, who combine the\nenergy of indie rock with the structural and harmonic freedoms of jazz.\nLeeds\u2019 Roller Trio, complete the\nnight\u2019s line up, a group combining\nelements of funk, noise, electronic,\nand rock music with schizophrenic\nthemes but whose identity ultimately\neludes pigeonholing given the immense variety in their compositions.\nUnderground legends of Poland\u2019s\nnew jazz scene, Jazzpospolita (16th,\nPOSK) mix jazz with elements of psychedelic rock and electronic music to\ncreate delightfully modern yet accessible sound.\nOn the back of this year\u2019s stunning\ndebut on Tzadik\u2019s Spotlight Series,\nFrench jazzers Guillaume Perret &\nThe Electric Epic are set to storm\nthe Bishopsgate Institute on the 17th\nwith their breed of highly energetic\nfusion of electric jazz and progressive\nrock. The triple bill also includes the\nLeeds based trioVD, fearlessly shattering conventions with a metallic,\nabrasive mixture of distorted guitars,\nthrashing drums, and wailing sax, all\nwhilst retaining a strong sense of direction and melodic sensibility.

When it\u2019s\nover, he gets up, bows and leaves.\nPerhapsthemostcontroversialpieceof\nmusic ever written, John Cage\u2019s 4\u201933\u2019\u2019 is\nnot a comedy routine, but a call to listen-ing. Invariantly, the longer the piece goes\non, the more the audience gets frustrated\nand begins to make noise, disrupting the\nsilence. The environment becomes the\ninstrument.\nHe wasn\u2019t looking for silence. He found\nit did not exist. In 1951, he stood in an\nanechoic chamber (a room with absolute\nacoustic isolation) to experience silence.\nInstead he heard two sounds, one high\nand one low \u2013 his nervous system and\nhis blood circulation. \u201cUntil I die there\nwill be sounds. And they will continue\nfollowing my death. One need not fear\nabout the future of music.\u201d\nCage listened to the world. Chance operations were one of his favourite methods of composition. Whether throwing dice to determine what was played\nwhen, or using the I Ching (an ancient\nChinese text used for divination), his\nmusical ventures were often informed\nby Zen teachings. In more deterministic\nworks, he employed a variety of objects\nand techniques to make sound. Child of\nTree is played on ampli\ufb01ed cactus, using\nthe plant as a resonating body. He also\ninvented the prepared piano, by placing various objects between the strings,\ncreating a curious medley of percussive\nsounds when the keys were struck.\nWhat\u2019s wonderful about his music is\nthat it is timeless. His scores are open to\ninterpretation, yet governed by chance.\nThe principles translate to just about any\nfacet of life.\nIt is his centenary this year and as a result there are innumerable performances\nof his work taking place everywhere (the\nnext one is on Monday at Kings Place).\nLast month, the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich held a one-day festival called Out\nof the Cage. Numerous performances\nwere happening at once around the campus and the audience was encouraged\nto move between them. One man was\ncooking mushrooms (picking them was\na passion of Cage\u2019s) and serving them to\npassersby while he mic\u2019ed up the pot and\ncutting board, running it through ran-domised e\ufb00ects. In another room, dance\nstudents interpreted random words chosen by the audience to the sound of prepared pianos. The night culminated in\nthe courtyard, where four loudspeakers\nplayed four symphonic orchestras simul-taneously. The quadruple-climax was the\nmost immense musical moment I have\never experienced.\nBefore leaving, a song of Happy Birthday. The rules were: sing every syllable\nuntil you are out of breath.

Furthermore,\nHEAR will allow employers to get a\nbetter picture of who their applicants\nare as well as to be more certain about\nthe claims made on applicants\u2019 CVs.\nSince then, The Burgess Implementation Steering Group (BISG) created\nby Universities UK and GuildHE have\ntested the new scheme in 30 di\ufb00erent\ninstitutions across the country and the\n\ufb01nal report was published in October\nthis year where universities were recommended to include the new report\nfor the students who enrolled this\nyear.\nThere is some con\ufb02ict evidence of\nwhat the general position of the universities regarding the scheme is. So\nfar 109 have signed up for it and this\nis more than a half of all the higher\neducation institutions, however, this\nonly includes 14 out of 24 members of\nthe Russell Group. Furthermore, Oxbridge has already completely rejected\nthe idea with Oxford being concerned\nwith \u201ca lack of interest from employers\u201d and Cambridge giving no reason at all. Nevertheless, it\u2019s too early\nto give up \u2013 Peter Williams, one of\nthe members of BISG, is certain that\nOxbridge will eventually adopt the\nscheme \u201cbut only if the HEAR catches\nup generally\u201d, stating that \u201cOxbrige\n[is] not generally \u2018leading\u2019 universities\nwhen it comes to innovations of this\nsort.\u201d\nHaving previously recognized that a\ndegree on its own is no longer good\nenough to get a job, at the beginning\nof this year Imperial introduced Imperial Horizons which is a program\no\ufb00ering the undergraduates to enhance their university experience\nwith a short course in a wide variety\nof humanities\u2019 subjects. According\nto The Head of Co-Curricular Studies, Eryl Price-Davies, their team are\n\u201ccommitted to representing, on a student\u2019s transcript, that they have taken\nand achieved in Imperial Horizons\ncourses\u201d which essentially follows the\nidea of HEAR. But the \ufb01nal decision\nis still to come and is partially up to\nstudents: \u201cWe are consulting with students on the best form of wording. We\nwouldn\u2019t want to do it without consulting students\u201d\nDoug Hunt, Deputy President (Edu-cation) was asked for comment on the\nmatter and said: \u201cMy personal opinion\nis that the HEAR or a similar recording system would be good for Imperial\nundergraduates, since a large propor-The election results for the outstanding\nCouncil positions have been announced.\nIn the incredibly catchily named Faculty\nof Engineering Undergraduate Council Ordinary Member Election, Joseph\nGibbs, Oladipupo and Thomas Lim were\nall elected with 64, 30, and 21 votes in\nthe \ufb01rst round respectively. Joseph Gibbs\nwas elected in Round 1, with the other\ntwo being elected in Round 2.

If you are\ninterested, then please do come along\nand read the related paper that Paul\nBeaumont wrote via www.imperial-collegeunion.org/your-union/how-were-run/committee\nAlong with the \ufb01nal decision on Imperial Horizons, the decision regarding the HEAR is also to be made as the\nposition of Imperial on the matter is\nstill not clear. However, Imperial College London produces a degree sup-plement, which is similar to this and\nincludes much of the extra-curricular\nmaterial that the report focuses on.\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\n\u00a35000 challenge launched\nThe Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) has announced that it\nis holding its student challenges com-petition, with an increased prize of\n\u00a35000 to develop the winning project\nfurther.\nThis is the second year that the\ncompetition will be running, and the\naward is aimed at supporting research\nat Imperial that has a focus on tackling health problems and challenges\nthroughout the world.

A group of scientists decide that\nwhat giant sharks, as if they weren\u2019t\nscary enough, are really lacking is\nbrains. A few freaky experiments later,\nand the sharks get clever and team up\nto sink the rig housing the group of\nmoron scientists and one token black\nchef (LL Cool J). Spoiler: basically\neveryone gets eaten. Some really awful special e\ufb00ects, overdramatic lines,\nand physical impossibilities make this\n\ufb01lm simultaneously shit as well as bril-liant. Because who doesn\u2019t enjoy the\nsight of absolute idiots being mauled\nby super-cunning creatures with three\nrows of razor sharp teeth?\nNotting Hill (1999)\nI would never have put this in the \u2018terrible\u2019 category until I recently discovered nobody outside my immediate\nfamily rates this \ufb01lm. I actually think\nit\u2019s pretty special \u2013 and the scene that\nsees Hugh Grant walking through\nNotting Hill as the seasons change, set\nto Bill Withers\u2019 \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine\u201d is\none of my favourite ever scenes. With\nscreenplay by Richard Curtis, who also\nwrote Four Weddings and a Funeral\n(another excellent and probably widely loathed \ufb01lm), a kick-ass soundtrack,\nmy secret fantasy cast (Julia Roberts,\nHugh Grant, Rhys Ifans, Gina Mckee\nand Hugh Bonneville); I\u2019m still perplexed as to why this \ufb01lm is bad. Simple plot: bumbling, foppish (who else\nwould Grant play?) English bookshop\nowner meets the most famous woman\nin the world, American actress Anna\nScott (Julia Roberts, playing herself,\nprobably); and they fall in and out of\nlove. But the really special parts are\nplayed by Grant\u2019s posse of eccentric\nfriends; not least by Ifans, whose inappropriate costumes throughout are\nworth watching alone. And the Costello cover of \u201cShe\u201d recorded for the\nopening credits? Whenever I hear it I\nknow that I will continue to watch and\nre-watch this gem of a \ufb01lm.\nMiss Congeniality (2000)\nI\u2019m a sucker for transformation \ufb01lms,\nand not in an Optimus Prime way.\nAn uncouth Sandra Bullock plays\nFBI agent Gracie Hart, who goes undercover in order to stop a domestic\nterrorist plot to attack the 75th Miss\nUnited States beauty pageant. Bullock\nis transformed from disgusting slob\nto poised beauty who still manages\nto kick some terrorist arse even while\nwearing massive heels and a tiara.\nBullock should never have been in this\n\ufb01lm, because frankly she\u2019s too good an\nactress: the story was pretty awful and\na lot of the acting dire. Nonetheless,\nMiss Congeniality is funny despite its\npredictability; and saw Bullock nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress.\nSave the Last Dance (2001)\nDance movies are universally cliche.\nThis one is no exception \u2013 ballerina\nSara (Julia Stiles) encounters a personal tragedy and vows never to dance\nagain. She moves to the black part of\ntown, and falls in love with hip-hop\ndancer Derek (Sean Patrick Thomas), as well as with dance again. Rife\nwith racial stereotypes, this \ufb01lm tries\nto hard to be something it isn\u2019t. That\naside, it features some inventive dance\nroutines; and as far as dance movies\ngo, a fairly involving storyline.\nSnakes on a Plane (2006)\nMore Samuel L Jackson comedy gold.\nPretty self explanatory \u2013 hundreds of\ndeadly snakes get released into an airborne plane with the intent of crashing\nit. The graphics were poor, the acting\nwas poor, the struggles with obviously\nrubber snakes ridiculous, but none of\nthat mattered. Just stupid, gory fun.\n27 Dresses (2008)\nThis sounds like a trashy rom-com\nnightmare \u2013 and to be fair it has all\nthe components. Katherine Heigl,\nvacuous storyline, the inappropriate\ncrush, the obvious husband material,\nand more weddings than a Moonie\nceremony. It is horrendously predict-able; and some of the characters are\nso underdeveloped they could just\nbe made of cardboard and nobody\nwould notice, but despite all that, I still\nlove it and watch it. Heigl plays a serial bridesmaid in love with her boss,\nGeorge, who falls in love with her slut-ty sister Tess, (never before has a character ignited such burning hatred in\nme). Heartbroken, Heigl falls into the\narms of the true man of her dreams\n(James Marsden, so hot) but not before sabotaging her sister\u2019s wedding.\nMy love of Heigl knows no bounds: if\nshe\u2019s in it, I will give it a go; and the\nsteady stream of hideous bridesmaid\ndresses and wedding plannage satis\ufb01es the occasional cravings I have for\nlow brow, thoughtless entertainment.\nPlus, a drunken, appallingly-sung rendition of one of my all time favourite\nsongs \u201cBennie and the Jets\u201d secures its\nplace in my secret-love list.\nJurassic Park IV (2014)\nOK, so this hasn\u2019t actually been made\nyet, but when it does it will almost certainly go into this category. Dinosaur\nDNA gets mixed with human, creating\nfantastic dino-man hybrids with guns.\nThis sounds TOTALLY AWESOME.\nAnd let\u2019s face it, the franchise lost all\ncredibility after the third \ufb01lm anyway.\nFILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n\n"

All this proves to me is\nthat the singles charts are fucked beyond saving but apparently it was a\nreason for celebration, and what better way to celebrate then playing a\nknock out show in East London.\nThe support band Post War Years\nat \ufb01rst reminded me of a sub-par\nDelphic, who themselves are a diet\nversion of New Order so I was not\nexpecting anything to blow me away.\nI was left pleasantly surprised by their\nelectro-schtick and soaring tunes but I\ncannot decide whether my low expectations were the decisive factor.\nOpening with \u2018Su\ufb00ragette Su\ufb00ragette\u2019 Everything Everything showed\ntheir intent straight from the start\nto brighten up the bitterly cold night\nfor everyone in the majestically cool\nvenue. Half of the set consisted of\nnew tracks interspersed between old\nfavourites and it was clear to see that\nthe band enjoyed the chance to play\nfresh songs. The exhaustive touring of\ntheir last album had certainly taken its\ntoll but this was a band revitalised and\nrefocused. Some of the most notable\nnew tracks which are going to make\npeople lose their shit are \u2018Kemosabe\u2019\nand \u2018Torso of the Week\u2019.\nEverything Everything are the sort\nof band that your stereotypical Imperial student should love. Their indie\nhits creep towards the angular math-rock side of the spectrum, they used to\ndo all their shows in orange jumpsuits\nto continue some sort of in-joke, and\ntheir songs include some hilariously\nnerdy lyrics. Highlights include \u201cIsambard, I am all steel\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m as giddy as a\nbaby in a centrifuge\u201d and my personal\nfavourite \u201cYou said \u2018Boy Lets Fuck the\nOzone\u2019 but boy that hole is too wide\u201d.\nGenius!\nThe set came to a frenetic ending\nwith \u2018Cough Cough\u2019, \u2019Two for Nero\u2019\nand \u2018Photoshop Handsome\u2019 frothing\nup the crowd into a fanciful lather.\nEverything Everything have de\ufb01nitely\nmatured and their upcoming album,\nset to be released in January of next\nyear, is looking like it won\u2019t disappoint.\nTheir new sound is slightly more expansive but keeps the lyrical edge and\nthe rush you experience when you\nhear the saccharine choruses. Will\n2013 belong to Everything Everything\njust as this year has belonged to the\nVaccines? They managed to charm\nthe pants o\ufb00 of East London tonight\nwithout breaking into a canter so I\nwouldn\u2019t bet against them.\nMark England Music Editor\nApparently bright\ncolours are not in this\nseason. Or smiles...\nSoul hero Terry Callier passes on\nTwo weeks ago Terry Callier\u2019s name\nwas added to the ever increasing list\nof great soul artists who are no longer\nwith us. Callier, born in 1940\u2019s Chicago released his \ufb01rst record in 1968\nto little commercial success. This was\nfollowed up in the \ufb01rst half of the 70\u2019s\nwith two more albums, including the\nbrilliant What Colour is Love. Again,\ndespite being critically acclaimed,\nlittle commercial success followed.\nWhile Callier toured with the likes\nof Gil Scott-Heron and Jerry Butler\nhe struggled to join them at the top of\nbillboards. Two releases later and into\nthe early 1980\u2019s Callier retired from\nmusic to concentrate on bringing up\nhis daughter.\nSo far, so unremarkable. Yet in the\nlate 1980\u2019s a little-known release from\nTerry Callier started lighting up dance\n\ufb02oors over this side of the pond. Eddie Piller, owner of Acid Jazz Records\n(alongside Gilles Peterson), contacted Callier asking to put out this\nparticular record; it was agreed and\nwithin two years Callier was using\nvacations from his job as an administrator at the University of Chicago to\nplay gigs and festivals here in England.\nCallier started recording again, all be\nit reluctantly, and touring more.\nIn 1998 his album Timepeace received an award from the United\nNations; instead of this bringing him\nfame it meant his employers at the\nUniversity found out about his double life, and promptly \ufb01red him. That\nTerry Callier never received the wide\nacclaim during his recording career\nthat he deserved is a travesty, yet he\nwas always relaxed about what came\nhis way. Music was just one of his in-Simon Hunter Music Editor\nterests, family being his \ufb01rst. On being\nasked about hitting the big time he responded \u201cIf I broke as big as the Beatles tomorrow, it still wouldn\u2019t mean\nmuch because my mom\u2019s not here\u201d.\nGet on Spotify and search:\n\u2018You\u2019re Goin\u2019 Miss Your Candyman\u2019\n\u2018Dancing Girl\u2019\n\u2018Ordinary Joe\u2019\n\n"

We should call them\nout when they abuse it.\nAdam Clancy\nParliamentary privilege my arse\nhen the expenses scandal originally\nbroke in 2009,\nmy opinion was\nsuccinctly summarised by a Guardian feature wherein an MP of the time\ndescribed the story as a \u201cwonderful\nmoment of British \ufb01ddling, but more\non a Dad\u2019s Army scale than the real\ncorruption of politics.\u201d Yes, the MPs\nhad decided against buying their own\nhobnobs/tampons/moats but MP pay\nis poor for a thankless, gruelling job\nand I envisioned the majority of expenses as a deserved bonus. Not to\nmention the whole thing was worth\nit to o\ufb03cially see that toilet seats\nwere not designed to support John\nPrescott.\nThe exception was of course second\nhomes, with four MPs and two Lords\njailed for false accounting (although\nnotably David Laws escaped criminal action despite renting his second\nhome out to his partner). Here, people had stepped beyond taking liberties with reclaiming work-related\nmoats and had willingly and criminally abused their position for \ufb01nancial gain to the cost of the taxpayer. In\nR v Chaytor it was argued that these\nMPs could hide behind Parliamentary\nprivilege which says that MPs cannot\nbe charged for what they say in Parliament and parliamentary paperwork\ncannot be used as evidence in court.\nThey were told to MTFU [sic] by the\nSupreme Court, sent to jail and the\nwhole debacle was put to bed.\nAnd now it has been reawakened\nby a Mr MacShane: the very man who\nonce eloquently described expenses as\na Dad\u2019s Army scale issue. It is alleged\nthat he willingly deceived with 19 of\nhis invoices, a markedly more serious\nallegation than telling the truth about\ntaking advantage of expenses. He too\nlooks like he will be employing Parliamentary privilege as his \ufb01rst line of\ndefence against any potential criminal\ncharge, which seems ridiculous given\nthe precedent set down earlier in the\nsame scandal. The unfortunate thing\nhowever, isn\u2019t just that he could be\nsuccessful in his defence, but that he\nis employing it at all.\nImmunity from prosecution is important for political heavyweights,\nas lawmakers must be able to throw\nanything up for debate with unlimited free speech and ambassadors\nmust know that they can continue\ntheir mission without the possibility of false accusations tarring their\nrole. The problem is that some of the\nelite few fail to recognise this is a two\nway street. These rules are there to\nprotect the integrity of the o\ufb03ce, not\nthe freedom of its occupier. Anyone\no\ufb00ered such a shield can and should\nuse it when they have held themselves\nto a higher moral standard but should\nnot cower behind it when they have\nsullied the position itself.\nIn an ideal world, people granted\nsuch a position would agree to forgo\ntheir get-out-of-jail-free card when\nthey know themselves to be guilty,\nbut expecting such self-sacri\ufb01ce\nwould be na\u00efve. Realistically how-W\never, we can at least expect the state\nto hold its representatives account-able. In 1997 a Georgian ambassador killed a girl through drink driving and Georgia waived immunity as\nthey knew he was in the wrong \u2013 it is\nthis behaviour that lends diplomatic\nimmunity a great deal of credibility.\nSimilarly, should MacShane be tried,\nI believe the state has every right to\nwaive a law as he is abusing his privilege as much as he allegedly abused\nhis \ufb01nancial power. If he did nothing\ncriminal, let him prove it himself. If\nhe is guilty, I don\u2019t want him to walk\nfree by sacri\ufb01cing the integrity of our\nlaws.\nLaughing all the\nway to court\nSirs,\nI know not whether any of your avid\nreaders venture past Big Sainsbury\u2019s\non Cromwell Road, but I simply must\ntake the opportunity to thoroughly\nwhinge about the Big Tesco near\nEarls Court. Imagine my dismay\nupon venturing inside those walls of\ncapitalism when it emerged that the\nlayout has been changed \u2013 yet again!\nAllegedly it is for our own benefit. A\nnew pharmacy has been promised,\nalongside the intriguingly named\n\u2018Euphorium Bakery\u2019, or something to\nthat effect at least. I simply cannot\ncarry out my shopping in peace when\nfaced with so much constant change\nat every opportunity. Perhaps I will\nhave to take my business to the self-service tills of Big Sainsbury\u2019s, or even\n(gasp!) Tesco Express on Gloucester\nRoad.\nYours in triumphant worry,\nA consumer\nSir,\nI would like to express my annoyance with those members of college\nwho seem unable to grasp the way\nin which transport around campus\noperates. I am speaking, of course,\nabout those who insist on travelling\nto pivotal high-traffic areas, before\npausing there to engage in a jovial\nchat, while on either side of them\nsomething akin to a freeway pile-up\ndevelops.\nA particularly egregious example of this is the Sherfield atrium,\nin which dozens of people can have\ntheir journey abruptly halted, so\nthat Michael can tell Paul how many\nyards of ale he downed the night be-fore.\nSuch flagrant obstruction of\na major transportation conduit\nwould certainly not be tolerated on\nthe road, and neither should it be\naround campus. Therefore I propose\nthe launching of a public-informa-tion campaign, in order to inform\nstudents and staff of the many harms\nof inconsiderate walking.\nFor instance, at the top and bottom\nof the Sherfield stairway, we could\nposition some signs reading: \u201cPlease\ndo not enter this staircase unless you\nare committed to traversing its entire\nlength without stopping.\u201d This would\ncertainly give those who might otherwise have not considered the consequences of their actions some pause\nfor thought.\nYours,\nA concerned citizen\n\u201c\u201d\nI don\u2019t want\nhim to walk\nfree by\nsacrificing\nthe integrity\nof our laws\n\n"

    "content": "Obama Claims Second Term\nEmilie Beauchamp has the results from America.\nast Tuesday, 6 November\n2012, Americans re-elect-ed Barack Obama as the\nPresident of the United\nStates, for a second and\nlast four year mandate. It was a slim\nvictory after a harrowing campaign,\nnothing as glamorous as his \ufb01rst \u2018Yes\nwe can\u2019 pinnacle, but still a win. Shall\nwe \ufb01nally see Obama power through\nwith his close-hearted healthcare and\ntax reforms? Does this mean new beginnings of hope for peace on Earth?\nFar from it. For those who have slept\nthrough the most important political event of the year, here is a blitz on\nwhat needs to be known about what\nhappened, what to expect in the US\nover the next four years and what it\nmeans for the rest of the world.\nAnd the exhausted winner is\u2026\nThe 2012 race to Presidency was one\nof the most competitive in ages, with\npolls swaying left and right for a new\nfavourite candidate every hour. Both\nhopefuls spent relentless weeks and\naltogether more than $1.5 billion on\naggressive campaigns. Last Wednesday 7 November, at approximately 6\nGMT, President Obama was declared\nre-elected with a total of 302 votes\nhence securing the 270 votes required\nto get elected. On his side, Romney\nwon 206 votes, while 29 remained un-allocated \u2013 meaning the voters simply\ndidn\u2019t turn up. In parallel, the Democrats retained a majority in the Senate,\nbut the House of Representative is still\ndominated by the Republicans.\nWhat does this all mean? As an ap-parte, in the US, it is good to remember that individuals vote through the\nelectoral college, who are pledged\nto presidential and vice-presidential\ncandidates based on the popular vote.\nEach state and the District of Columbia have di\ufb00erent quantities of votes\nallocated pro rata to their population.\nTo be elected President one has to gain\n270 of the 538 votes dispersed across\nthe country. This explains why while\nthe map of the US can seem overwhelmingly crimson at \ufb01rst glance\nwith a large band of sworn Republican\nstates in the middle of the country; the\ndedicated Democratic coastal states\nprove to be more populous. This last\nelection was considered particularly\ncompetitive, as eight \u2018swing\u2019 states\n(representing 18% of the US popula-tion) were oscillating between camps\nlong into Election Day: Colorado,\nFlorida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\nIn the wee hours of the morning, Iowa\nswayed for Obama, making him clear\nthe magic 270 mark to get re-elected.\nDark clouds will linger\nWhile Obama won a second term, he\nwill still be dragging relics of his past.\nFirst, the President will be facing a\ngridlocked Congress, which will keep\non making it hard for him to press on\nhis agenda. As a brief recap, the President can only sign a law once the Congress has passed it as a bill. But this in\nturn requires that the two Houses of\nthe Congress, or the Senate and the\nHouse of Representatives, agree to-gether. The intended purpose of this\nintricate political system is to prevent\nanything less than a wildly popular\nPresident passing unilateral laws without checks. In other words, it usually\nmakes legislating very slow to avoid\npoliticians infringing on individual\nrights and liberties of the American\npopulace.\nAgainst that background, Obama\nfaces the enormous task of tackling the national economy. Amongst\nothers, this means addressing the\nstagnant 7.9% unemployment rate,\ndealing with a $1 trillion in annual\nde\ufb01cits, trimming the $16 trillion national debt and facing a \ufb01scal policy\nreform legally planned for the beginning of 2013. One might wonder why\nObama still wishes to be Head of the\nUS in such ominous circumstances.\nBut Democrats heading the country\nmeans more in terms of state liberties.\nTake for example Maine and Maryland\u2019s population, who have already\nrushed to put in place same-sex marriage legislations. Similarly, Colorado\nand Washington became the \ufb01rst U.S.\nstates to legalize the possession and\nsale of marijuana for recreational use\njust last Tuesday.\nBetter news for us than the US\nWith regards to foreign policy, not\nmuch change is expected either but\nthis is rather good news for the world.\nIn fact, the continuation of the Obama\nadministration is an immense sigh of\nrelief for most countries. Embroiled in\nits economic crisis, the last thing the\nEU needs is a distraction from internal a\ufb00airs in lieu of new Republican\nforeign policy, having built joint positions with the Democrats over the\npast four years. While there are no\ngrand strategies over international aid\nand development in Africa and Asia,\nwe can expect a closing of trade relationships in Central and South America \u2013 yet nothing out of the bloom.\nAmerica\u2019s current focus on the Middle East is likely to remain too. Troops\nwill continue to withdraw from Afghanistan, but new con\ufb02icts have\ntaken the spotlight: the war in Syria\nonly ever expanding to neighbouring\nstates, and Iran\u2019s nuclear a\ufb00ront will\nhave to be addressed soon. One of the\ntrickiest tasks will probably be taming\nthe new generation of Arab leaders\nthat emerged from the Arab Spring,\nmost of which do not count the US as\ntheir favourite pal. Add on top of that\na mounting rivalry with China and\nhead-butts with Russia, and the President has his hands full!\nOverall, the grey clouds hanging\nover Obama\u2019s head seem like they are\nhere to stay, forecasting nothing more\nthan a lingering status quo in domestic and foreign policy. Yet instead of\nlosing patience or accusing Obama\nto have failed his original leftist pro-gramme, one should always consider\nwhat our world would look like in four\nyears\u2019 time if Americans would have\nchosen to elect their \ufb01rst Mormon\nPresident rather than give Obama a\nsecond chance.\nL\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n16\nPolitics Editors: Padraic Calpin\nMarie-Laure Hicks\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Invisible Candidates\ns stated by the Federal Election Commission, 413 people have\nfiled a Statement of Candidacy, meaning that they are effectively\nrunning for President of the United States of America. Two of these\ncandidates have access to 270 or more electoral council votes, so it is\npossible for them to get the job if they win enough states.\nGary Johnson, former Governor of New Mexico, is running for the Libertarian Party, following his initial unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomi-nation, centred on balancing the budget by reducing government spending by\n43%.\nThe Green Party has nominated Jill Stein, a physician from Massachusetts.\nOne of her main proposals is a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, aiming to create public sector jobs in the clean energy sector to reduce unemployment and boost the\neconomy. She has been endorsed, amongst others, by the infamous political\ncritic and linguist Noam Chomsky.\nA\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nWhat can you do with $6bn?\nhe total cost of the US election this year is not yet known precisely,\nbut it\u2019s been estimated that the figure will run in at close to $6bn.\nAdvertising alone in this election cycle ran over $2bn.\nBut this is an astounding amount of money; in 2010, the total election spend from all UK parties was a mere $49m, less than 1% of the American\ntotal. This week, Felix Poltics asks: what exactly can you do with $6bn?\n\u2022 Build the LHC \u2013 TheestimatedconstructioncostsoftheLargeHandron\nCollider were $4.7bn and it\u2019s annual running cost is about $1.2bn. So this\nelection could cover construction and one year of experimentation at\nthe LHC.\n\u2022 Bail Out US Towns (and then some) \u2013 In the past 4 years, 10 US municipalities have had to file for bankruptcy, but outstanding debts are\na drop in the ocean compared to this expenditure: most recently, San\nBernardino in California filed with debts of $45m, again less than 1%.\n\u2022 Boost Federal Budgets \u2013 The Federal Budgets for both NASA and the\nDepartment of Education this year run at about $18bn apiece. So, with\nthe US Election spend, the nation could increase either of these by 33%.\n\u2022 Make a Downpayment on Sandy \u2013 Hurricane Sandy, which struck the\nUS last week, is estimated to cause anywhere from $20-60bn in dam-ages, of which $6bn is no small fraction. Indeed, $6bn is roughly the\nannual budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nT\nPadraic Calpin\nTrollbama Strikes Again\nPolitics Editor\nAWW MAN. I lost, but at\nAWW MAN.

    "content": "Preserving your judgement\nAlex Savell avoids sticking a knife in his eye at the Jam Cupboard\nt\u2019s a hard thing, striking a balance between hotel dining\nroom and proper restaurant.\nThe prospect instantly calls\nto mind several possibilities:\nthe over cushioned, shag-pile of a\nseaside resort; or the soulless, whitewashed canteen \u2013 scrubbed so hard\nit removed all personality in its quest\nto achieve the Scandinavian, \ufb02at-pack\n\ufb01nish. Though it perhaps strays a little into the undertow of this second\nswirling maelstrom, the Jam Cupboard on Gloucester Road does seem\nto manage to navigate the dangerous\nstraits between Scylla and Charybdis\nwithout capsizing horribly along the\nway.\nUpon \ufb01rst impressions, the restau-rant, associated with the Rydges Hotel complex, does appear to be a fairly\nseaworthy vessel in the same way that\na P&O ferry is \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s\nabout to spring a leak or unleash a colony of rats from the galley, but you\u2019re\nnot necessarily overwhelmed by the\nluxury of the surroundings. However,\nas you settle, your attention starts to\nbe drawn to details that belie this early\njudgement. Much like a good suit, it\u2019s\nthis eye for detail that marks it out.\nFrom the gently unique wine glasses\nand the crisp, leather-bound menus;\nthrough to the \u2018unobtrusive but out\nthere\u2019 lightshade and the subtly minimalist feature wall, the restaurant isn\u2019t\njust cut to highlight its broad shoulders and slim waist \u2013 it\u2019s also been\npaired with a carefully selected shirt,\ntie and cu\ufb04ink combination.\nThere\u2019s one more important thing\nto comment on before the food in\nany dining experience, and that\u2019s the\nwine. I have no pretentions to the title of wine connoisseur, nor any real\nknowledge on the matter. However, I\nlike a glass of red and feel I ought to be\nable to get something pretty palatable\nwithout the pain in my back pocket\nreaching excruciating levels. With\nits satisfying length and breadth, the\nJam Cupboard\u2019s wine list does cater\nfor this \u2013 it includes everything from\na few a\ufb00ordable wines by the glass or\nbottle, up to something to splash out\non. That said, however, we ended up\ngambling on the \u00a317.50 Wine of The\nMonth. With a wager like this, even a\ngood restaurant can choose to stitch\nyou up worse than a Mexican surgeon who\u2019s just watched that episode\nof Top Gear. But we were pleasantly\nsurprised by the Primitivo that ar-rived, which The Blonde (possessing\na better palate than mine) decreed to\nhave a pleasantly nutty bouquet. Even\nI could appreciate its fairly light and\nmellow \ufb02avour lacking the acidy kick\nof a cheaper wine.\nIt\u2019s di\ufb03cult to come up with an accurate metaphor for the menu. The\nbest I can do is to say that it\u2019s like Delia\nSmith: everything there makes your\nmouth water \u2013 quintessentially British and guaranteed to be satisfying.\nBut if you\u2019re anything like me (or as it\nturns out The Blonde, which was a little bit of a surprise), chances are you\u2019re\ngoing to get more excited by Nigella.\nPut plainly, though we were enjoying the exquisite frustration of paring\ndown our eventual meal from a number of appetising options, we realised\nthat this was partially due to how safe\nthe selection was. Personally, I don\u2019t\nthink you need your entire menu to be\nstrange and innovative combinations\nof \ufb02avours to be appealing, but I think\nthe menu here slightly missed the balance between dishes that jump out as\n\u2018interesting\u2019 and things that lean a little bit towards good, rural pub grub.\nStill, in the grand scheme of things,\nthis is clearly a minor sin and complaining about having too many\nperfectly adequate choices seems\nrather ungrateful. So we quickly shut\nup and plumped for our respective\nmeals \u2013 Pea and Asparagus Tart followed by Onglet Steak done bleu for\nThe Blonde, and Ham Hock Terrine\nwith Piccalilli plus Slow-Cooked Beef\nCheek for me. On arrival, the presentation stands up to that of the restau-rant, with my only slight gripe being\nits predictability compared with the\neclectic choices of the room.\nThe food itself did just edge, ten-tatively, into that bracket of cuisine\nwhere you feel the urge to consume\nslightly slower and savour it slightly\nmore. For me, the terrine was a little\ntoo chilled; partially losing the \ufb02avour\nI was hoping for \u2013 though I couldn\u2019t\ncomplain about the Piccalilli which\nsatis\ufb01ed my love for all things pickled.\nThe Blonde was perfectly happy with\nher tart, having to ful\ufb01l her \u201cgrumbling quota\u201d with some choice remarks about the validity of slinging an\nassault of Eastern \ufb02avour (in this case,\ncoriander leaf) like a kamikaze plane\ninto an otherwise perfectly good sal-ad. This is the problem with food in a\nplace somewhat nicer than my normal\nboozer of choice; you are \ufb01guratively\npoking your head above the comfortable trench of adequate mediocrity\nand into the \ufb01ring line of real culinary prowess from a wealth of good\nLondon restaurants. However, there\nis a niche for places that bridge the\ngap between pub grub and the upper\nechelons of the culinary world, and it\nprobably speaks in the Jam Cupboard\u2019s\nfavour that I started to think of it in\nthis category. Clearly, its pretentions\nto sneak quietly out of the hotel-din-ing-room clich\u00e9 have been successful.\nI\u2019ve managed all this before commenting on the mains. The slow-cooked beef cheek fell apart in my\nmouth like a male fresher chatting up\na girl in FiveSixEight. The bleu onglet\narrived looking moist but worryingly\ncooked, however with the \ufb01rst cut the\nenjoyably red centre was revealed. My\nmash was given just the barest hint of\nwholegrain mustard whispering sweet\nnothings of \ufb02avour to my tongue \u2013 the\nentire a\ufb00air was extremely tasty. For\nboth my and The Blonde\u2019s taste it was\nslightly under-seasoned, but knowing\nmy predilection to add black pepper to\npractically anything, I\u2019d give the bene\ufb01t of the doubt on this. In any case,\nthey certainly raised their game.\nOverall, it\u2019s not a place I\u2019d tell people\nto walk across hot lava (or Central London) to go to, but it works extremely\nwell as a convenient and friendly spot\nfor a quick, intimate meal.

But let\u2019s face it, by the\ntime the third \ufb01lm in a franchise turns\nup, nobody is expecting very much.\nBut Madagascar 3 is surprisingly\ngood \u2013 so good in fact that it currently\nholds the number two spot in the UK\nBox O\ufb03ce.\nThe dynamic quartet of Alex the lion\n(Stiller), Gloria the hippo (Pinkett-Smith), Melman the gira\ufb00e (Schwim-mer) and Marty the zebra (Rock) are\nback for this third installment, and\nare still trying to get home to America from Africa, via\u2026Monte Carlo.\nWhich doesn\u2019t seem hugely logical\nbut, hey \u2013 the animals can talk, so\nwe\u2019re not nit-picking here. The new\nadventure begins when the gang lie\nlow in a travelling circus, ruled over by\nan eastern European tiger called Vitaly (Bryan Cranston), who once had\na rather strange act involving jumping through an impossibly small hoop\nwhile slicked with olive oil. Make of\nthat what you will. The ever amusing\nSacha Baron Cohen makes a returning appearance as the eccentric King\nJulien the ring-tailed lemur, and the\nwhole cast working together make it\na happy, cheery \ufb01lm for all the family\n(with a couple of little innuendos that\nare likely to \ufb02y over children\u2019s heads,\nbut make mum and dad snigger).\nMadagascar 3 is modest and down-to-earth, and clearly wasn\u2019t expecting much from the box o\ufb03ce, but has\nfortunately become a big success. The\ngreat script from Eric Darnell and\nNoah Baumbach proves itself, with\nlots of laughs and a few tender mo-ments, and the energy of the whole\n\ufb01lm is endearing. A bright, colourful,\nenthusiastic \ufb01lm \u2013 and certainly one\nto catch.\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\nTaken 2\nDirector: Olivier Megaton\nScreenwriters: Luc Besson, Robert\nMark Karmen\nStarring: Liam Neeson, Famke\nJanssen, Maggie Grace\nProducer Luc Besson and director\nOlivier Megaton had a smash hit on\ntheir hands with 2008\u2019s Taken, starring Liam Neeson as the ex-CIA guy\nwhose daughter was kidnapped by\ntra\ufb03ckers in Europe. Needless to say,\nLiam went after the bad guys, found\nthem and killed them. Sorted. It was\nsuch a success that a sequel was inevitable \u2013 and it\u2019s got a strange twist, this\none. This time around, it\u2019s Liam who\u2019s\ngot himself kidnapped, and his daughter who is trying to save him.\nChained up in a dark, damp basement in Istanbul (while his Turkish\nabductors casually watch football\nin the next room), Liam whips out a\ntiny hidden mobile phone, calls his\ndaughter and tells her to get hold of\nhis guns and grenades \u2013 and come\nand \ufb01nd him. Which is odd when you\nconsider that, in the \ufb01rst \ufb01lm, Liam\nbarely wanted his daughter to leave\nthe house incase of danger \u2013 but now\nhe\u2019s inviting her into a practical suicide mission.\nNeeson, being the ever professional\nactor, puts just as much e\ufb00ort into this\nperformance as his much more serious\nroles (such as Oskar Schindler), but\neven he can\u2019t save this one. The \ufb01rst\nmovie, box o\ufb03ce hit though it may\nhave been, was a bit pants. This one\nis ridiculous, and the premise is a little tired. Not only that, but the saving\ngrace of the \ufb01rst \ufb01lm was Liam\u2019s casual\nattitude to a bit of torture \u2013 electrocu-tion, a few beatings etc \u2013 which made\nthe \ufb01lm a 15, but Taken 2 is a 12A, and\nnowhere near as fun and gory. It\u2019s safe\nto say that this tamer, sillier version of\nTaken is a bit of a disappointment.\nTop 10 Box\nOffice Films\n1. Skyfall\n2. Madagascar 3\n3. Taken 2\n4. Paranormal\nActivity 4\n5.

Kathleen Kennedy, the current Co-Chairman of Lucas\ufb01lm, will\nbecome President of the company\nwhen it becomes part of Disney after the takeover, and as such will be\nreporting to the Walt Disney Studios\nChairman, Alan Horn. The deal also\nincludes the much smaller Industrial\nLight & Magic, the pioneering special e\ufb00ects group that has been at\nthe forefront of \ufb01lm-making since its\nwork on Star Wars in the 1970s.\nThe Star Wars \ufb01lms in the long-running franchise and their subsequent re-releases have created nearly\n$5bn in global ticket sales, according\nto data analysed by Bloomberg. Mr\nIger said Disney intended to keep\nthe operation, as well as LucasArts,\nwhich produces computer games\nsuch as Lego Star Wars, Star Wars:\nThe Force Unleashed and Star Wars\nBattlefront. Shares in The Walt Disney Company closed on Friday at\n$50.08, valuing the entertainment\ngroup at $89.9bn.\nIf Mickey Mouse comes anywhere near me...kill him I will\n\n"

Michael earned himself \ufb01rst of many \ufb01nes by closely losing\nout to Fraser by .04 seconds. Similarly\nin this event Niki \ufb01nished in 27s with\ncompliments from Brad \u201cNiki, your\ntechnique was held perfectly throughout the race, well done mate!\u201d. (In an\nAustralian accent...)\nThe girls got o\ufb00 to a good start with\nCatherine breaking the IC 50m free record to then beat her own time again\nin the \ufb01rst leg of the girls relay \ufb01nal in\na time of 27.71, giving her a \ufb01ne to give\nout (unfortunately to myself\u2026). More\nsuccess on Friday evening was brought\nby Caterina qualifying for the 50 backstroke semi \ufb01nal, to then swim even\nfaster in a time of 30.91 to get our \ufb01rst\nBUCS point (and IC record) by qualifying for the \ufb01nal \ufb01nishing in 8th place.\nAfter an unwelcome 7am wake up\nFraser managed to smash out a 55.06\nin 100 free with Niki and Michael\nclosely following in low 57\u2019s! Catherine\nalso closely followed the boys with a\n60 second 100 free making a new IC\nrecord, followed again very closely by\nZelie in 1.03. Also, for this event, Hayley earned herself her \ufb01rst \ufb01ne with a\nwrong entry time for Meric (sorry!)\nMatt Jackson, though feeling unwell\nmanaged to pull a 1.07 out of the bag\nfor the 100m backstroke. Also in this\nevent, Fraser reveals himself as not\nonly a freestyle swimmer by \ufb01nishing\nin a 1.04 for 100m backstroke.\nCaterina narrowly missed out on a\n200m \ufb01nal quali\ufb01cation. Great e\ufb00ort\nwas put in by Meri\u00e7 and Hayley for\nthis event however, setting some good\ntimes to start this year o\ufb00. Morris Po\nset a new IC record in a time of 2.15\nfor the 200 IM.\nTo quote Morris Po before his 200\nbreastroke swim: \u2018I don\u2019t want to swim\nthis event because I don\u2019t want to upset\nFlorian by beating his record\u2019, which\nBrad didn\u2019t think was a viable excuse\nto drop out. Bad news for Florian then,\nas his record was swiftly broken by\nMorris in a time of 2.31s. Morris and\nCaterina continued to shine with their\nperformances in the 200 backstroke\nevent \u2013 Caterina qualifying for the \ufb01nal and Morris setting a new IC record\nin a time of 2.13.\nScott, whilst modelling the tight blue\nspeedos, put out a great performance\nin both breastroke events, only narrowly missing out on breaking (his\nown) IC records.\nMichael Ingram swam the dreaded\n100 \ufb02y on Sunday morning whilst the\nmajority of the team stayed in bed/\nhad a cooked breakfast and Catherine\nsimilarly battled out in the 200m free\nsetting a new IC record of 2.17.\nThe relays were all swam at times\nvery close to IC records with all 4\nboys (Fraser, Scott, Niki and Michael)\nswimming 25\u2019s in the 4*50m free relay\nand the girls (Catherine, Hayley, Zelie\nand Caterina) qualifying for the \ufb01nal\non Sunday evening. Morris Po set a\nnew 50m backstroke record in the \ufb01rst\nleg of the boys medley relay in a time\nof 29.64. The girls ended the competition by \ufb01nishing in 5th place in the\nfreestyle relay after qualifying in 10th\nplace.\nThere was not one disappointing\nswim all weekend, with everyone performing better than expected after\nonly 5 weeks into training.\nThe Freshers (and Scott) were all rewarded (they might say punished\u2026)\non Sunday evening with a large number of shots and pennied pints con-sumed. Special mention goes to Fraser\nfor \ufb01nishing all his \ufb01nes after chunder-ing only 12 hours earlier from the night\nbefore at She\ufb03eld Union. Additionally,\nScott (after a struggle) managed to \ufb01nish his larger number of \ufb01nes (not sure\nhow he managed to get so many...) and\njust managed to save the queen before\nheading home.\nOverall, a successful and fun weekend to hopefully be topped by the long\ncourse meet in February. Well done\nguys!\nHockey Ladies 1s haunt UCL\nHarriet Stevenson Ladies 1s\nOn All Hallows Eve the Ladies 1\u2019s set\nout to play some old rivals UCL. UCL\nde\ufb01nitely had a point to prove as we\nhad put them out of 2 cups last year.\nWe went out hard in the \ufb01rst 10mins\nwith a new line-up having fresher\nBryony in central-mid\ufb01eld controlling the game. With some good play\ndown the right, from Gigi and Hazman we scored our \ufb01rst goal from a\nshort corner, from banana slit (Har-riet).\nOur con\ufb01dence grew and great\nplay up to the forwards from fresher\nHayley ensured we had the majority\nof possession. We had lots of shots\nnarrowly missing or being saved from\nJules and Sorcha. Unfortunately UCL\nwere relentless in their determination\nand managed to aggressively score a\ngoal just before half time, making the\nscore 1-1.\nWe set out for the second half determined to get a goal back in the\n\ufb01rst 5 minutes. Our second goal took\nsome time but came from a reverse\nstick shot again from the one and\nonly Hazman! We were however also\nfaced by the fearsome attack from\nUCL keeping our keeper Percy busy,\nluckily UCL were unsuccessful in getting past her ninja-like skills. She was\naided by a miraculous save o\ufb00 the line\nfrom Emma, resulting in a breakaway\nfrom us and Hazman tucking away\nher hatrick. Defenders Kirsty, Maria\nand Anna Tommy kept strong and\nprevented further chances from the\nUCL forwards with some textbook\ndefending, low \ufb02at tackles. The distribution from the back was beautiful\nfrom Celia helping to keep the ball\ndown out end of the pitch and giving\nthe forwards more and more chances.\nThe accuracy from her passes was\nultimately too much for the UCL defender to cope with and a ball through\nto Sorcha giving her a one-on-one\nchance at the goalie brought us our\n4th goal of the game. Skilful tackling\nfrom Kathryn in the last few minutes\nof the game in our attacking D, resulted in some close chances but the \ufb01nal\nscore was 4-1.\nThis has been a tricky season for the\nLadies 1s getting promoted from last\nyear and now facing tough teams. The\nteam is growing in con\ufb01dence and\nwith this \ufb01rst Win hopefully they can\nbuild on their successes, to try and remain in this league next season. Good\nLuck girls!\nSuper speedy superheroes\nSophie Kirk Club Captain\nOn a cold Wednesday afternoon Imperial\u2019s \ufb01nest runners headed o\ufb00 to Richmond Park for the second of our London\nCollege League races of the year. Since\nthe race coincided with Halloween, club\nmembers stepped up to the mark with\nsome spooky costumes to scare o\ufb00 the\ncompetition. We de\ufb01nitely deserved the\nprize for best dressed team.\nDespite some transport issues causing\ntheracetobedelayedbyhalfanhour,Im-perial were ready to take on the 2.5 mile\nor 5 mile course.

Dr\nSean Barrett, a Royal Society University Research Fellow and a member\nof the Controlled Quantum Dynamics Group, had been in the country\nfor less than an hour when the taxi\nhe was in was hit by a speeding 4x4\nthat had previously ran a red light. Dr\nBarrett, 36, and his driver, Kuldeep\nSingh, are believed to have died in-stantly.\nThe larger car had been reported\nstolen on 16 October 2012 and police\nbelieve it had been used in a number\nof crimes prior to the crash. The car\nhad been involved in a high-speed\nchase with the authorities, but the\npolice withdrew when continuing\nwas deemed to dangerous. The driver,\nwho was taken to a local hospital with\nbroken legs, has been charged with\nmanslaughter.\nIn a statement, Assistant Police\nCommissioner Gary Budge said that\nthe police chase ended \u201ca long, long\nway from where the crash occurred\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cIt is di\ufb03cult to imagine\nthe trauma that two families must be\nfeeling out there today. I want to pass\non my condolences to both of those\nfamilies and tell them we will provide\nall the support that is possible to both\nof them.\u201d\nDr Barrett had studied at Cambridge University for his undergraduate and postgraduate degree. His\ndoctoral work was on quantum information processing in a condensed\nmatter system. He moved on to a\njunior position at HP Labs in Bristol,\nand after an initial spell at Imperial,\neventually returned to Imperial College London where he held the Royal\nSociety University Research Fellowship. At the time of the accident, he\nhad only been lecturing for one year.\nDr Barret had been due to speak\nat a quantum physics conference the\nfollowing week. In light of his death\nthe conference was rededicated in\nhis memory. The Universities of\nWestern Australia and Queensland,\nwho organised the event, released a\nstatement praising \u201cSean\u2019s strength\nof character and insight\u201d. It went on\nto say: \u201cHe was at the height of his\ncareer and leaves an outstanding research record.

Our\nthoughts and condolences are with\nDr Barrett\u2019s family, friends and colleagues at this tragic time.\u201d\nProfessor Myungshik Kin and Dr\nTerry Rudolph wrote a tribute to\ntheir friend and colleague on the Imperial College website.

Shockingly,\nat Imperial there must have been\nplenty of men out there willing to\nhelp her achieve this aim.\nSarah told Felix via email that she\nis \u201creally happy\u201d about the feat, and\nthat she \u201cwould like to thank everyone who helped, especially those who\nagreed to come along at the last moment!\u201d\nSarah had previously broken three\nGuinness World Records. The three\nrecords were all broken last year.\nThese were for most sticky notes on\nthe body simultaneously, most CDs\n\ufb02ipped and caught in one minute,\nand most champagne bottles opened\nin one minute. She had previously attempted the most kisses received in\none minute record, however the record was discounted due to techni-calities.

I\nseemed to blunder through the years\nof my undergraduate course in blissful ignorance of this undercurrent of\nsexism, which I feel is often part of the\nImperial culture. In my little bubble of\nfriends I remained on the whole obliv-ious, until I stepped into the spotlight\ncast by Union politics and elections. I\nwas generally an outsider to the Union fold before I ran for my Sabbatical\nposition. I won\u2019t dredge up the past,\nbut during campaigning I was subjected to derogatory comments based\nupon my gender. I was incredibly an-gry, taking the point of view that I am\nhappy for people to criticise me based\nupon my views, but not my looks.\nThis year, the Physics society has\nalready been mentioned in the Independent regarding an email sent out\nwhich caused o\ufb00ence to some female\n\ufb01rst year students and rightly so. The\nSexism call for evidence\nlaunched at Imperial\nattitudes towards this email that I have\ncome across have been at times quite\nfrankly horrifying. Such as \u2018the person\nwho sent this email was a female so\ntherefore it can\u2019t be sexist\u2019. Comments\nof this nature are not down to the gender of the person that made them or\nindeed the intent of how they were\nmade; the only concern should be that\nindividuals found them o\ufb00ensive. I\nam proud to say that this year things\nare being highlighted to me passed on\nfrom the Gender Equality o\ufb03cer; it\nworries me that in the past incidents\nmay have gone unreported.\nSo, what are we going to do? I can\u2019t\nhelp but feel that there might be a cultural issue here at Imperial. Is it because we are an institution with the\npercentage of females \ufb02uctuating between 34-36%? Honestly I don\u2019t know\nbut I want to \ufb01nd out. The answer I\nfeel is not to hold a Sexism survey,\nbut to adopt the approach that the\ngovernment takes when gathering\ninformation about Higher Education.\nSo this article is here to introduce my\ncall for evidence. The email account\nsexism@imperial.ac.uk is now active.\nI am happy to receive anonymous or\nnamed responses from any student or\nsta\ufb00 member who would like to get\ndown their attitudes towards sexism\nand experiences of gender discrimina-Becky Lane, Deputy President (Welfare) launches a call for every-one, lecturers and students, to share their experiences of sexism\ntion and Imperial College.\nI might be completely o\ufb00 the mark\nhere but I hope to gain answers to\nsome of these questions. Is Imperial College a sexist environment? At\ntimes do both male and female students fell discriminated against because of their gender? Have you ever\nfelt during your studies you have been\ntreated di\ufb00erently because of your\ngender? These are just some of the\nquestions that I hope to get the answers to.\nMaking a call for evidence is all very\nwell and good, but what am I going\nto do with this information? Well I\nplan to display the submissions in a\npublic place in College in an artistic\nMillions of pounds of extra\nfunding for Imperial\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nImperial are to be one of twelve\nuniversities that are going to bene\ufb01t from \u00a36m of funding from the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE).\nIn a speech at the UUK conference,\nDavid Willetts, Mnister for Universities and Science, announced that\nHEFCE will give the highest performing universities in knowledge\nexchange an additional \u00a36m. Imperial was amongst the twelve universities that will be allocated the fund-ing. The aim of the extra funding, as\nstated on the HEFCE website, is to\n\u201cstimulate economic growth through\nresearch commercialisation activities\u201d.\nImperial was one of the highest performing universities in the area of\nknowledge exchange.\nL\nBecky Lane\nDeputy President\n(Welfare) way; I also plan to produce the Sexism\n@ Imperial report to present to College. An institutional problem needs\nan institutional shift in attitude to\nmake a change. This is also creating\nan anonymous way for students to report issues of sexism even after the report is made. To make an anonymous\nsubmission you can just create a hotmail account merely for the purpose\nof making the submission, or if you\nsend it from your personal account\nyour name will never be mentioned.\nThe only people with access will be\nthe Deputy President (Welfare) and\nthe Gender Equality o\ufb03cer. Help us\nanswer some of these questions and\nmake a di\ufb00erence.\nReport suggests 15% cap on year abroad fees\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nA government report by Professor\nColin Riordan, Chair of the UK HE\nInternational Unit, suggested that the\ncap on fees for year abroads should be\n15% of the fee charged for a normal\nyear, which is \u00a39000 for most Imperial\nundergraduate courses. This means\nthat the fee would be \u00a31350, which\ncould be seen as an incentive for students to save money by going on a year\nabroad.\nThe new limit would be a decrease in\nthe current \ufb01gure charged by Imperial,\nwhich is 50%.\nThe aim of the reduced cap is to\nboost the number of students gaining\ninternational experience from overseas study.\nThe cap would apply to all students\ndoing a year abroad inside or outside\nof the EU.\nProfessor Riordan commented:\n\u201cStudying, working or volunteering\nabroad increases the employability and\n\ufb01nancial rewards for students in the international labour market. Despite this\nthe UK ranks just 25th in the world for\nthe number of students studying overseas.\u201d David Willetts, Universities and\nScience Minister, praised year abroad\nschemes as o\ufb00ering a \u201chuge range of\nbene\ufb01ts for students taking part\u201d and\nthat they also help \u201cour universities\nand the wider UK economy\u201d.\nAt the minute, it is only a suggestion\nand not a law. Therefore universities\nare not obliged to charge the suggested\n15% cap.\nComment on year abroad scheme by\nDoug Hunt, Deputy President (Educa-tion) p14.\n\n"

Obama looks very triumphant!\nArts Editor\nFRIDAY 09 NOVEMBER\n26\nmet Geraldine Cox in a windy\ngaret on the roof of the physics building. The abandoned\nweather station is an octagonal room half-open to the elements and \ufb01lled with drying clothes,\nbits of mouldering, esoteric looking\nequipment and empty beer bottles.\nIt was an appropriately idiosyncratic\nsetting for an interview with a unusual\nperson. Geraldine is the Department\nof Physics\u2019 artist in residence.\nOver the sound of the howling wind\nwe begun to talk about here experiences and her work. As we chatted a\nrainbow formed over Hyde Park.\nMeredith: When did you start this\nresidency?\nGeraldine: Well, it\u2019s hazy. I started\nthinking about connecting physics\nwith art about three years ago.\nI originally did a degree in Physics\nthen I worked for Accenture for a few\nyears. You don\u2019t need to mention that\n[laughs]. Then I went to art school for\nfour years. After you\u2019ve learned to be\nan artist and you\u2019ve learned to paint,\nyou ask yourself \u2013 \u201cwhat shall I make\nwork about? What do I want to say?\u201d\nThat was why I came here. I had a\nhunch that there would be something\nhere to talk about, and I had the background to do it.\nTo me it was personal in the sense\nthat it was like pulling strands together in my mind that are important to\nme. I really used to love physics and\nthis was an opportunity to combine it\nwith art.\nI was incredibly lucky, I went to a\ntalk one night and met the speaker \u2013\nhe put me in touch with Terry Rudolf\nwho works in quantum information.\nI\u2019d had forgotten all my physics so I\nstarted reading books. It was formally,\nApril the 1st, 2011 when the Leverhume Trust paid for an award to do\nthat \ufb01rst year of work. That\u2019s when\npeople started calling me the artist in\nresidence, which is a title that I never\nhave aspired to.\nM: How would you describe yourself and your work?\nG: I really try to avoid any labels.\nSometimes my work is educational\nor documentary and sometimes it is\nexpressive or poetic. Sometimes it\nis about the science, sometimes it is\nabout the people. I don\u2019t really worry\nabout it. I call myself an artist, but that\nis because I am interested in expressing di\ufb00erent ideas. But the artist in\nresidence thing is a bit too formal for\nme.\nM: So what did you feel that you\ncould gain from this relationship\nyou have with the physics depart-ment... whatever it is?\nG: Well, I didn\u2019t have a clear idea when\nI started. I felt that there were things\nthere that were really worth exploring and expressing as an artist. Other\nthan that I had really no idea what I\nexpected.\nI decided that, this is going to sound\na bit \ufb02aky, a bit arty-farty, but I decided that I wanted to make work that\nwas really optimistic, about the best\nthat humans can be. It is a really interesting aspect of humanity. I wanted\nto talk about humans and discovery\nand how they see the world. I think,\nphilosophically there is a lot that can\nbe learned from science for life in gen-eral. There is a sense of the power that\nit gives you, but also the humility. You\nunderstand the limits of your knowl-edge.\nM: How much of a di\ufb00erence did\nyour science background make?\nG: Massive. It makes all the di\ufb00erence.\nEven though when I started I was incredibly rusty. I read over 30 books\nin the \ufb01rst year. I couldn\u2019t even think\nabout an electron when I \ufb01rst met\nTerry.\nWhen I got here I did nothing for\nthree months apart from speak to\npeople, just to \ufb01nd out what was going on in the building, who these people are, how they work. No one has to\nstart from scratch with you, which can\nbe tedious and you can make connections yourself.\nIt is the idea that you see something\nhere and extrapolate it somewhere\nelse and you get a deeper understanding of physics. It is incredibly exciting.\nYou get these things that just pop up\nagain and again on all these di\ufb00erent\nscales around the world and the uni-verse. That we can even see that and\nmap that is amazing. Yes the physics I\nthink is just a massive help.\nM: Has the experience lived up to\nyour expectations?\nG: The thing about being here is\nthat your mind is constantly being\nstretched because you are always experiencing and thinking of the world\nin di\ufb00erent ways \u2013 developing di\ufb00erent abstract models all the time. It\u2019s\njust incredibly exciting. It\u2019s more ex-I\nGeraldine Cox the artist\nin residence at Huxely\n\n"

However,\nImperial\u2019s Business school rankings for\nthe MBA programme are slipping, with\nImperial\u2019s MBA currently being ranked\n46th place in the Financial Times. These\nrankings are a signi\ufb01cant decrease\nfrom previous years, when the business\nschool took 37th place last year and was\nranked 32nd in 2010, which was the\nhighest ranking achieved by Imperial\u2019s\nMBA programme. Imperial\u2019s business\nschool entered the top 90 in 2002, it \ufb01rst\nbroke into the Financial Times world\u2019s\ntop 50 MBA rankings in 2006. This\nequated to an impressive rise of 30 places within 3 years. Yet the 14 place slip\nover the last 3 years may suggest that the\nrapid boom was short lived.\nFT rankings overview\nThis year, Imperial\u2019s MBA ranking positions it lower than LSB (4th), Oxford\n(20th), Cambridge (26th), Warwrick\n(27th ), Manchester (31st), Cran\ufb01eld\n(36th) and Cass (38th). Within the sub\ncategories, Imperial\u2019s highest was for\ncareer progress, where it came in at 19.\nImperial\u2019s value for money was ranked\nin 38th position.\nThe tuition fees for the full time MBA\nare \u00a336,000; this is a fairly competitive\nvalue in terms of cost if compare to\nLondon Business School (LBS), where\nthe MBA tuition fees were almost 60%\nmore than Imperial\u2019s at a tremendous\n\u00a357,500. The FT ranks LBS 4th and this\nwas the highest ranking achieved by any\nUK business school. Stanford ranked 1st\nplace, it has a tuition fees of $106,236,\nwhich equates to \u00a366,496. It may seem\nlike the tuition fees of an MBA programme increases with its ranking,\nhowever, the cost not always correlated\nto its position in the league table. The\nMBA o\ufb00ered by India\u2019s Institue of Management Ahmedabad was ranked 11th\nby the FT; the tuition fees were Rs. 15\nLakhs, which equates to \u00a317,280.\nHow are the FT rankings compiled?\nTo be considered for the FT ranking, the\nbusiness school must be internationally\naccredited as well as have run the course\nfor at least four consecutive years. In\n2012, 150 business schools participated\nin the rankings. The data is compiled\nfrom online surveys completed by the\nschool as well as former students. 20 different criteria are used to determine the\n\ufb01nal ranking. Data from alumni contributes to 8 of the 20 categories, which\ncarries 59% of the rankings weight. Data\ncollected in 2012 carries 50% of the \ufb01nal\nweight, the remaining data is from the\n2010 and 2011 rankings that contribute\n25% each. The \ufb01rst two categories investigate the di\ufb00erence in the alumni salary\nfrom the start of their MBA to 2012, this\ngives the current and weighted salary\nfor the business school. 11 other criteria contribute to 31% of the \ufb01nal rank,\nthey are determined by a questionnaire\ncompleted by the business school. This\nNida Mahmud probes the latest ranking of the Business School\nquestionnaire investigates factors such\nas diversity of teaching sta\ufb00 and MBA\nstudents as well as the international\nreach of the MBA. The \ufb01nal criteria\nis the research rank, it calculates the\nnumber of articles published by sta\ufb00\nmembers in 45 di\ufb00erent journals. Consequently, a \ufb01nal score is calculated for\neach school that can be used to rank the\nMBA.\nThe QS rankings\nThe QS Global 200 Business Schools\nReport ranks business schools with respect to geographic location or MBA\nspecialisation. Imperial was ranked 12th\nwithin the Europe business school cat-egory. For the specialised MBA catego-ry, Imperial makes the global top 50 for\ntwo categories: Entrepreneurship and\nFinance, at positions 24 and 22 respectively for 2012. QS also o\ufb00er a personalised score card service, which is an interactive tool that personalises the MBA\nrankings depending on the criteria most\nimportant to the student.\nAnd Finally\u2026.\nNevertheless, university rankings\nshould also be\ntaken with caution as di\ufb00erent\nmethodologies\nare used to compile the rankings.\nIt is sometimes\ndi\ufb03cult to know\nhow the rankings\nare compiled and\nwhat sources have\nbeen considered.\nFurthermore, taking a global view of\nthe MBA rankings\nmay be mislead-ing. For example, a\nlot of emphasis on MBA league tables\nis placed on the average salary received\nafter graduation, yet this \ufb01gure varies\ndrastically depending on the geographic\nlocation. Additionally, the MBA league\ntable produced by the Economist has\nnot considered Imperial within its top\n100 rank, the reason behind this is un-clear.\nImperial 9 places from\nlast year in Global MBA\nRankings\naces from\nlobal MBA\nQS Rankings place Imperial\nMBA 12th in Europe\nin Europe\n93% of graduates\nare in employment\none year after\nTaken from the FT\nBusiness School\nLondon School of Business\nOxford (Sa\u00efd)\nCambridge (Judge)\nWarwick\nManchester\nCranfield\nCass\nImperial\n2012 Ranking\n4\n20\n26\n27\n31\n36\n38\n46\n2011 Ranking\n1\n27\n26\n58\n29\n34\n32\n37\n2010 Ranking\n1\n16\n21\n42\n40\n260\n41\n32\n3 year average rank\n2\n20\n24\n42\n33\n32\n37\n38\nI\n\n"
