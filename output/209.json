    "content": "10 FELIX Yourcareer\nHere are 5 questions you ought to ask before\nyou decide on your career; and 5 answers, as\nthey apply to the Royal Air Force.\n1 WILL IT USE YOUR DEGREE? WILL YOU BE WORKING' AT FULL STRETCH'? The R.A.F. is not only one of the most efficient and most complex\norganisations in the country, it is also one of the largest and most\nup-to-date. The R.A.F. offers great scope to graduates of all\nfaculties: the command, direction, long-term planning and\noverall administration of the Service demands trained minds,\nimagination, and outstanding^ability. This is why the R.A.F. goes to such pains to attract Graduates, to offer them specially\nfavourable terms of entry, back-dated seniority, and so on.\n2 WHAT ARE YOUR PROSPECTS? Excellent. All the top jobs in the R.A.F. are filled from within the\norganisation. Make no mistake, it is men like you who will be the\nAir Marshals of the 1990's.3 IS THE WORK INTERESTING? RETROSPECT l PROSPECTS4 Three of the attractions of an R.A.F. career are variety, responsibility and a real sense of purpose. You don't go on year after year\ndoing the same job. You assume considerable responsibility at an\nearly age. You play a part in international as well as national\naffairs, and contribute to peace and security throughout the world.\nCAN YOU TRAVEL AND SEE THE WORLD? Yes indeed. Travel is part and parcel of R.A.F. life. You can\nexpect to live abroad some of the time, and get to know foreign\ncountries as no tourist ever could.\n5 AND TH EV\nUL GAR MATTER OF \u00a3\\s.d. Right from the moment you join, the pay is good and your standard of living is high. As an air crew officer of 25, married and\nwith full allowances, you could be earning about \u00a31,900 ave ar. NOW which of these careers attracts you most? FLYING AND EXECUTIVE? If this is for you, you should find out more about the Flying Branch.\nENGINEERING? In the Technical Branch, the R.A.F. has vacancies\nfor electrical, electronic .Jid mechanical engineers,\nTEACHING? In the R.A.F. you could teach (according to your\nqualifications) at any level through G.C.E. to post-graduate.\nMANAGEMENT? Much of the day-to-day management of the\nR.A.F. on the ground falls to the Equipment and Secretarial Branches.\nEquipment officers are the logistics experts, and deal with the plan-ning, supply and movement of all mate riel. The Secretarial Branch is\nresponsible for general administration, personnel management and\nintelligence.\nFOR MORE INFORMATION\u2014please contact the Secretary ofthe\nAppointments Board, or write giving your qualifications and your age,\nsaying which Branch most appeals to you, to:\u2014 Group Captain J.

    "content": "2 FELI X POST WAR EUROPE\nThe sight of the Main Physics Lecture Theatre\nfilled to capacity every Tuesday this term with\nmembers of I.C. listening to lectures on modern\nhistory has been a remarkable testimony to the\nabilities of Michael Howard, Professor of War\nStudies at King's College London. His magnetic\npersonality, his excellent speaking and his perfectly logical presentation of what could easily\nhave been merely a confusing array of facts have\nmade his series of talks on \" The Shaping of Post\nWar Europe \" an un forget able experience for all\nwho attended them.\nThis is a period of history through which we\nhave all lived, even though we may not have been\nconscious of the dramatic events happening around\nus. Professor Howard has led us expertly through\nthe jumble of political controversy and international\ncrises which is modern history to present us with\na very clear picture of the origins of the present\nworld situation.\nWith speakers as good as this, General Studies\ncould become a very useful and important part of\nlife at I.C., and would be attended by a far greater\nproportion of the college than supports the normal\nrun of often rather mediocre talks organised at\npresent C.A.L EGG. GENERAL\nSTUDIES\n<\ns> OBSERVERBRIEFINGS!\n\"She may have had something other women\nhaven't, but nothing in this wet film suggests it\"*\n\"A witty demonstration that what you lose on the\nmarriage roundabout is easily picked up on the\nadultery swings\"**\nEvery Sunday, The Observer in its two briefing\npages gives a lively consumer guide to entertainment and the arts\u2014the when and where\nof what's good, what's new and what's coming.\nYou can read short, sharp reviews of re-cords, paperbacks, television, art, theatre,\npop, pubs, films, night-spots, music, opera\u2014\neverything that is part of modern culture.\nAnd Observerbriefing backs up the reviews\nwith comment and background information.\nTry it this Sunday.\nIn THE OBSERVER every Sunday\n* The film 'A House Is Not A Home'\n** The play 'A Severed Head'\nAN ATHEIST'S NEEDS\nThe irreligious can be just as much in need of\nspiritual solace as those who believe, according\nto Miss Marghanita Laski, who addressed a crowded General Studies meeting last week.\nMis. Laski, a guest of the Huxley Society, said\nthat there are two kinds of people: those with\nemotional needs which have traditionally been\nsatisfied by religion and those who are not oppressed by the loneliness, guilt and imminence of death\nwhich are the human condition. These needs have\nuniversally found expression in the \" rites of\npassage,\" celebrating birth, maturation, marriage,\nand death; even atheists appoint godparents i or their children and cremations are accompanied by\n\" services.\"\nMiss Laski's answer to the atheist's need is to\naccept the actual content of religious, specially\nChristian, ritual; the technique of prayer, the\nbeautiful music, the poetry of the Bible, and even\n\"religious experience,\" while rejecting their \"over-beliefs,\" which are denied to him.\nIn question time, Miss Laski wisely refused to\ncounter ontological proofs of the existence of God,\nand broadly concurred with the easy-going attitude\nof a humanist who confessed that he disbelieved in\nGod, not on the evidence, but because he found\nit more satisfying. That should strike a chord\nin the heart of every Huxleyan.\nCHRIS COOPER\nJAZZ\nAND POETRY\n\" Man, we only had one practice\u2014I'm worried,\" said Fred\nWheeler. Fifteen minutes later\nhe was reciting poetry to the accompaniment of the Jazz Congress, a sextet of talented musicians who play in a modern vein.\nThe occasion was the IC. Jazz\nClub \"Jazz and Poetry Concert\"\nof Nov. 11th. This ambitious\nprogramme did not attract a very\nlarge audience, which is a pity\nbecause the evening provided\nboth entertainment and food for\nthought, not to mention some\nvery good jazz.\nThe entertainment was mainly\nprovided by Robin Riddihough,\nwhose expressive and humorous\npoems were a great hit with the\naudience. Fred Wheeler's recitations were mostly in a more\nserious vein and occasionally\nsuffered from in audibility thanks\nto I.C's superb amplification s ys Robin Riddihough\ntern. Never mind, I for one look\nforward to more of this: my\ninitial scepticism is gone: I am\nconverted.\nB.J. B. HUXLEY AND MARX\nThat Britain is not a good example of a \"free\" country was\nopined at a joint meeting of the\nHuxley and Communist Societies\nheld in Tizard Hall two weeks\nago.\nProceedings began with an\nunexpected episode, whose significance is still in dispute. Keith\nCavanagh, chairing for Comsoc, moved that 'the meeting send a telegram to South\nAfrica House expressing its disgust at the imminent execution of\nthree trade unionists for sabotage. The meeting assented by a narrow majority and though it\nappeared later that the charge involved murder, they were in the\nexcellent company of U Thant.\nThe discussion on \" The needs of\nthe individual and th fe requirements of the State \" was attended\nby about 30 people. The humanists charged their Marxist friends\nwith ad her ance to a rigid, opp res sive, and out-dated system of\nideas and referred to repression\nin Eastern Europe.\nThe Comsoc members defended\ntheir principles vigorously and referred to the undemocratic power\nof the English press and the semi-censorship of D notices, which\nprevented publication of news of\npersecution, of Roman Catholics\nin Northern Ireland and the Civil\nDefence Regional Government\nplans.\nThe role of the State as educator and creator of opinion was\ndiscussed; and the Guardian and\nWorker intellectuals present\nagreed that the Sketch and Mirror\nmasses should be released from\ntheir intellectual chains.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX II\nFOCUS The trouble is that we students\nlive in a world of \" Christian\nsocieties run by Christians for\nChristians \"; and I mean that as\na generalised criticism not of the\nsocieties themselves but of the\nway that we make use of them.\nYou probably belong to two or\nthree societies in which you really\nfeel at home (if you don't then\nyou're a brown-b agger extraordinary !) But it's equally probable that you've never gone to the\ntrouble of taking a look at the\nother societies, the ones that don't have any \" instant appeal.\" You\nwill have grown used to being in\na majority, and no doubt you enjoy evenings of mutual back-slapping. But admit it, you don't really gain anything from this\nsort of gathering except maybe a larger size in hats- So what I'm suggesting is that you try sticking your neck out, try broadening your horizons and being in\nthe minority for a change.\n\" But you haven't even mentioned the Buddhist Culture\nSociety yet.\"\nWell I will now\u2014because\nhere s one society where you cer-'\ntain ly would find yourself in a minority. And I believe that\nhere you'd learn a lot too, peron the Buddhist\nCulture Society\nhap s more than you imagine.\nYou've been brought up in the\nWestern way of life and you are\nused to Western religions. You\nknow what prayer is, and you\nwill have made up your own\nmind as to its worth. But how\nabout meditation ? Have you\never considered its purpose or\nreckoned its value ? And what\nabout reincarnation ? Have you\nexamined its feasibility or its implications ? The chances are the\nanswers are no, because you've\nnever had the opportunity to\nlearn about Eastern religions\nfirst hand. Or, to be more acc u rate, you've never taken the opportunities presented to you.\nThe Buddhist Culture offers\nyou those very opportunities. So\nwhy not stop being a self-satisfied\nChristian, agnostic or whatever\njust for one evening, and give\nyour stable world a jolt. It can't do you anything but good !\nSocieties like the Buddhist Culture Society are essential to the\nwelfare of I.C. as a college of university status. They need outside\nsupport, all of them ; and the\nBuddhist Culture Society deserves support too\u2014yours per-hap s?M. EDWARDS.\nIRE DREAMER AWAKES\nThe average engineer is a moronic, anti-social character,\nnot interested in subjects outside\nhis speciality In this, he is worse\nthan most other scientists.\nThis was one of Professor\nBuchanan's conclusions in his\naddress, \"The Dreamer Awakes,'\nto Wellsoc about a range of sub-j ect s, mostly unconnected with\nroad transport.

Bishop examining\nvarious aspects of student life at Imperial College.\nMy previous article showed how the staff could help students\nby improving the tutorial system- This continuation is to show how\nstudents could help themselves . . . the other side of the coin. How\nmany students neglect to attend tutorials . . . and why ? How many\nignore the various discussions and external lectures organised by\ntheir departments ?\nMany people, both staff and students, have given up organising\nspecial activities, merely due to continued lack of support. This can\narise due to either an unwanted activity, or an unwanted, unsuitable\norganiser. For many, the change from school to college lies in a change from taking all from the plate offered to selecting from the\nplate offered. So few will work to put goodies back on the plate.\nzone is the age-old age-barrier\nthe more senior members of staff\nmust cross in order to make con-tact, and be \" accepted.\" Many\nyounger members of staff find no\ndifficulty getting through, and\nthese people are the obvious\nchoice for tutors for the tutorial\nclasses outlined in the previous\narticle. Many of the staff are\nwilling to accept this, and some\ndepartments are already implementing the system (not because\nof my article, but in spite of it!).\nNow all remains with the stu-dent. He must make the vital\nfirst step. Do something. Call\nthe tutor a liar, and explain why.\nArgue back. Develop ideals.\nJump up and down- Swear\nvividly. Only in this way can\nyou help yourself develop.\nNOW, YOU In the Union, do something.\nGet with people. Join a Society.\nExplain your ideas. Help others\nto help yourself. Write to Felix\nand be constructive. Complain\nto Mooney, suggesting improve-ment s. Do you get good value from\nyour \u00a36 Union fees ? Offer your\nsupport, your time, your experience, your interest, your en-courage ment, yourself. Make\nyour name mean something to\nyou. Now YOU play the next\nmovement.\nSTUDENT ORGANISATIONS\nSmoothly run operations such\nas Morphy Day this year do not\ncome by chance. Many hours of\nthinking, planning, and physical\nwork by the three Vice-Presidents\nof the constituent colleges,\neagerly aided by a band of willing helpers led to a Morphy Day\nthat was enjoyed by all.who par-tic ipa ted. The Police were most\nhelpful, having been informed\nearlier in the week of the coming\nfestivities. In fact the resident\npoliceman, who accompanied the\nparty home, was \" impressed \" by\nthe \"Zebra Crossing,\" which inconvenienced the public far less\nthan if Royalty had crossed the\nPutney Bridge. (Contrary to the\nobjection of A.N. Other.)\nAnd the organizers of all student functions are just ordinary\nstudents, no different from the\nother 2,900 students . . . except\nthat they are keen to do things,\nwillingly, for the benefit of others,\nsometimes at their own inconvenience. THE BUSY BODIES\nJust as some sincere students\norganise activities that are\nfailures, so do staff organise\nevents that fail from lack of sup-port. It is important to note that\nthere is no sudden step between\nstaff and students, because, for\nexample, Bob Schrotcr, last year's President of Guilds, is now a member of Staff, and there is a continuous line joining the\nyoungest fresher to the most\nsenior member of staff.\nAs always, problems arise because of the oddities in the system . . \u2022 the man who pushes;\nthe member of staff who \" advises \" students how they should\nbehave within a fresher s' dinner,\nwithin the Union building; the\nstudent who forces issues at\nCouncil, or in a Union meeting,\nor in Felix, and it is people like\nthis who thwart what both staff\nand Union are trying to do.\nBoth bra an che s are aiming at\nmaking life more enjoyable for\nthe students. Work and play are\neach enjoyable in their respective\nways. It is reasonable to expect\nthe staff to make the academic\nprocess as interesting as possible ;\nthe Union must aim at the best\nsocially for the students.\nTHE BOUNDARY ZONE\nThe boundary zone is, as\nalways, the problem area.

The opponents are Northern Polytechnic\nwho are rather an unknown\nquantity as a rugby team, although in the past seasons their\nrecord hasn't been impressive.\nThey have no outstanding players\nthis year and have been finding it\nimpossible to field a team on\nWednesdays owing to the college\nlecture timetable. Of the five\nmatches played, four have been\nlost to unimpressive opponents\nand Regent St. Polytechnic were\nbeaten 16-3. However I.C.'s defeat at the hands of an underestimated C.E.M. two years ago,\nis ensuring caution in the home\ncamp.\nThe I.C. side has settled down\nvery well and is slowly being\nwelded into a powerful comb in a tion. The main feature of the\nplay so far has been the ability\nof the backs to link up with the\nforwards-This has been achieved by one of the best back\nrows seen at I.C. for several years. With this\nability to run the ball, coupled with a defence that\nhas only conceded 4 tries in 8 matches, I.C. should\ndefeat Northern Polytechnic today by quite a large margin, with the prospect of getting very\nnear to Motspur Park to retrieve the Gutteridge\nCupOn the right, H.D.

However, it\nseems to be a rule that the team does badly when\n\" guest stars \" are playing. Last Sunday the team\nincluded D. Thomas (D.T. s \u2014Saracen's2 nd row\nfot ward) and P. Johnson (ex-U.L. centre) and lost\n8-40 to a very strong Beckenham team.\nAlthough the team is improving the backs are\nprone to patches of bad handling. Marriage has\nnot slowed down Barber, who is still shoving well\nin the tight. Hall is playing extremely well and has\nmade several determined runs scoring three or four\ntries.

Sandhurst\nwon both relays quite comfort-ably. I.C.'s trouble is due to a noticeable lack of good class\ncompetition swimming this year;\nstarts and turns were bad and\nswimmers seemed to lack the stamina required to sprint the last\nlength.\nThe 'polo was a different story\nand here the Army duly met its\nWaterloo. Sandhurst opened the\nbattle with some long range\nartillery which caught the I.C. defence and goalkeeper Banyard\nunawares, so that the Academy\nwere two goals up in the first\nquarter. Hereafter, I.C. closed\nits ranks and started to attack.\nDavis and Ong brought I.C. level\nat half time, but Sandhurst were\nbeginning to tire.

Bean,\nBarry Pichler\nBrian Bull,\nChris Wright\nJohn Cawson\nMASCOTS\n\"The amorphous mass of I.C.\" said H.G. Wells many years\nago. Times have changed, but from the motion passed at the Union\nmeeting on 5th November, it appears that the attitude of I.C. students\nhasn't. Perhaps it was because no one had enough courage to stand up\nand speak against Des Kearns that Phoenix was given away to\nChurchill College, Cambridge, and the Queen's tower substituted as\nmascot. A mascot is meant to be the focus of Union Spirit. Do we\nnow have to hold the Union meetings on the central site, or have\nI.C. at last withdrawn from \" mascot pinching.\"\nLast year, the first for many years, I.C. pinched mascots from\nother London colleges, and, as a result, the general London student's opinion of l.C rose. We had begun, at last, to take an interest in\nthe many other colleges in London.\nDuring the Autumn Term all students who wish to partake in\nsport can do so in IX1\n.. with Freshers' dinners, Morphy Day, the\nswimming gala, but what of the rest of the year ? Not everyone is\na sober individual who does nothing but work! Surely indulging in\nvisits to other colleges is not to be banned because the LC. student\nknows what he wants but won't go out of his way to get it.\nUNION CLERK\nThe Union Clerk has arrived, on Wednesday of each week. If\nany club or society wishes to utilise her, please band in all letters,\nstencils, reports or whatever you want, typed by the Tuesday night,\nand we will endeavour to get them typed on Wednesday.\nFelix hopes to have most of its copy typed on the Wednesday\nprior to publication, so will all contributors please note new copy\ndeadlines:\n7.00 p.m. Tuesday All letters, general articles, small ads.\n12.00 noon Wednesday All.club and society news excluding sport-7.00 p.m. Wednesday All news. All Sport.\nPlease try and keep to these times\u2014if articles are subscribed\nlate we will try to publish them but we CANNOT GUARANTEE. FELIX\nOnce again Felix is 18 pages (including the Late News). This\nmakes us the largest London Student Newspaper and twice as large\nas most.\nFelix depends on you. If you are to continue to get full value\nfor your money then we must hear from you about any news you hear\n(including any society meetings you attend).\nULU REVITALISED\n\" This is the sort of thing UL U should do and can do well,\" said Tony\nBerry, IC's President 8fUL U, following the success of the first London\nstudent journalists' seminar on Saturday, 31st October. He intends that this\nevent and others like it will take place each year.\nIt aimed to improve university and college publications. Fifty representatives came from London colleges and the universities of Essex and Sussex\nto exchange ideas and benefit from the experience of three past Editors of\nSennet, now professional, and Mrs. Jill Platford, of Educational Publicity,\nFelix's advertising agency. There was also an opportunity to harangue\nSennet's Managing Director on the running of the UL U newspaper.\nPURPOSE\nA college newspaper has three main\ntasks :\n1. Be a forum for views.\n2. Present an information service.\n3. Communicate between Union\nand students.\nTwo speakers opined that it should\nbe controversial, should not resort to\nsensationalism, and must avoid any\nsuppression of news stories. Thus,\ncreating a good image, it will attract\nboth staff and readers.\nIf readers are to believe in the\nnewspaper then they expect professional standards. So the staff cannot\nplead amateurism for either mistakes\nor lack of information. But no student newspaper apart from LSE's Beaver can claim sufficient staff.\n\" Some sacrifice of Union funds is\nnecessary to create professionalism in\nthe newspaper.\" Further, the Editor\nshould not be tied down by the Union\nhierarchy in determining his policy.\nFelix has shown remarkable growth\nin advertising in the last two years.\nDue largely to Mike Combe's controversial Editorship, it has risen by\nover 30 per cent, on last year's figure\n(national average 10 per cent.).\nOUT OF PLACE\nReviews and feature articles do not\ncoL cuT T THE LITTLE DEBATE\nThe Debating Society, we are told, is making its\nn 'th attempt to get back on its feet again, but attendances remain disheartening ly low. One long\nterm remedy, that of giving people public speaking\nlessons, is, 1 am glad to say, materializing. However, in the meantime, I think that more well-known outsiders should be brought in to speak, in\nthe hope that more people will come to hear them,\nand perhaps even be moved so far as to make a speech from the floor. Certainly it needs more\naction than we've seen so far to counteract the\nvicious circle of decline that set in three years ago.\nOne has a sneaking suspicion, however, that the\ncrux of the matter is that most people have very\nfew ideas on subjects outside their work, and are\ncertainly not prepared to submit them to public\ncriticism. In which case, tomorrow's technocrats\nare going to be a very dull race of people.\n5 . 1 - 1\nTO PUTNEY\u2014BY TUBE\nMorphy day was one of the best examples of\nan enjoyable, non-alcoholic, student rag, that I have seen in London. The Law was co-operative,\nthere were very few cases of strop pines s amongst\nthe students, and the vice-presidents had the organization fairly well worked out. Consequently,\na good time was had by all, with very little inconvenience to the general public. Can this performance be repeated for the Swimming Gala? If so,\nit should be worth going to.\nLATE \" NEWS \"\nI would suggest to the Late News staff that\ntheir job is simply, to present news. The publication was never intended as a competition to the\nfeatures and discussion in Felix, and is completely\nunsuited for this job for several reasons. Incidentally, I have no doubt either that some of the\nblame for the content of ,the last issue should be\nshouldered by people who make no attempt to\nmake newsworthy stories available to the Editor.\nSome humour, yes, but no more py jama stories\nplease! ! !\nbelong unless they have a specific\nconnection with the college. While\nthe \" Presidents Column \" was out, a diary on Union personalities could be\ninteresting and informative. The\nnewspaper should not tackle any subject for which it is not equipped\u2014like\na women's column written by men.\nArticles must have a firm basis\u2014\nSennet's feature on IC's telephone\nswindle was quoted as a bad example,\nbased on false figures\u2014and should\nnot exceed the boundaries of the college unless there is some overlap (as\nwith Blackett). The Editorial should\nalso reflect this\u2014\" Who wants to\nknow the Sennet Editor's opinion on\nbirth pills ?\"\n\"There must be a consistency of\napproach in presentation.\" Complete\nrewriting is therefore advantageous.\nThis makes two jobs\u2014the reporter to\ndig up facts ; and the sub editor to\nknock the copy into shape.\nThe real stories come through the\nreporter and his personal contacts, especially the \" in-between^.\" men. The\nnews writer must be better informed\nthan his readers, must not show any\nbias and must omit his personality.\nAn article should be set out so :\n1. Punch line\u2014get out the story\nangle immediately \u2014 one quote\nmay suffice.\n2. Background.\n3. Details.\n4. Quotes by relevant people, fully\ntitled, and other sides to the pic-ture.\n\" You can count the dots in II columns,\" said a speaker on photo-graphs. Ideas are generally lacking\nin this field, but any picture worth\nprinting is worth printing big.\nWhat impressed us most about our\nevening visit to the Sunday Times\nwas the vast number of people stand-:\nng around doing nothing as nine\nbatteries of machines roared, printing\non \" paper made at our mills in\nCanada\" three sections of the mor-row's news\u2014all 56 pages of it ! On\nthe other six days of the week eight\nare idle. One prints The Guardian.\nAs our guide said, \"Mr. Thomson\nhas plans for the others.\"\u2014The Sun\nperhaps ?\nD.I. W. "

He is yet another of\nthose sicken ers who try to run\neveryone else's lives for them. It\nis well known that toddlers\nbrought up on the \" Look at the\nchu ffc huff\" type of training have\nall this guff to unlearn before\ngrowing up. SIMILARLY, students who have to suffer a\" cul-ture-monger \" tutor constantly\ngrilling them to ensure that their\n\" ideological standpoints \" conform to the norm, are handicapped when dealing with real\npeople.\nI always thought that the main\npurpose of a dinner was to fill the\nstomach, anything else being in-ci dental. Even Granny said that\nReligion and Politics must not be\ndiscussed at the tea-table as they\nmay play havoc with the digestion.\nWhat does D. G. Bishop think\nFreshers' dinners are for? Surely\nsitting at a dining table with a stranger while inviting polite chat\nis friend-destroying rather , than\nfriend making. And what \"friend\"\nprocesses his chum's mind? I OBJECT TO BEING TREA TED\nLIKE SO MANY OUNCES OF\nCHEESE.\nYours etc.,\nD.D. WILLIAMS\nA reply Dear Ounce of Cheese,\nHaving struggled through your\nDanish blue, which seems to offer\nlittle constructive criticism, I feel\nobliged to reply. I was amazed\nthat you assume that tutors are\ninclined to crush students into\npreconceived moulds. I advocate\nthat tutorials be a place where\nstudents make their own moulds\n\u2014create their own \" ideological\nstandpoints \"\u2014and develop them-selves.\nMost dinners are intended to fill\nthe stomach. Club dinners are\nsocial gatherings, and certainly\nnot occasions for \"inventing polite\nchat.\" Guilds Freshers dinners are\nnot meant merely to fill the\nStomach\u2014and even Granny would\nagree that Religion and Politics\nare rarely mentioned at these functions, and if-you are so lacking\nin social skills that you can't talk intelligently for a few hours\nat dinner, then by all means just\nfill your stomach . . . but then\nbread and cheese will fill the\nstomach.\nD.G.B. Well done Dear Sir,\n1 would like to congratulate\nyou and the Felix staff responsible\nfor the article on the Rover Crew\nDerbyshire weekend.\nYou certainly improved the\narticle from the rather un gramma tic state it was originally in.\nIf you continue this approach\nto articles in FeliR as outlined in\nyour editorial we shall be only too\npleased to write several more\narticles during the course of the\nyear. We will certainly have no\nmore complaints.\nThanking you for your endeavours, I am yours sincerely,\nW. N. WHALEY\n(Chairman, Rover Crew)\nDear Sir,\nAs you reported in your last edition of Felix, the President of\nGuilds Union has a small replica of Spanner. This is not usually seen,\nbecause it's main function is to accompany the President, or his\nrepresentative to Old Centralian Dinners, Spanner being far too unwieldy to travel on British Railways.\nMicrospanner is not a mascot, and is on a par with a photograph\nof Theta. He was taken down to Brighton on Bo, to be present at the\nMotor Club Luncheon. He came back in a small suit-case along with\nthe President's coat. This case was in the back of Bo on Morphy\nDay, and Microspanner was stolen by a gentleman of R.C.S. from the\ncar. Thus we were unable to take him up to last Friday's Old\nCentralian Dinner in Middlesborough.\nInstead, a gro tty piece of paper was pushed under my door,\ncontaining a series of numbers, this presumably being a\" clue.\" As\nthis has no official R.C.S. Union backing, I suggest that he, who has\nMicrospanner, return it either to Kish Sadhvani or Chris Evans, or\ndirectly to me.\nYours faithfully,\nD. G. BISHOP\n(President, C&G Union)\nMisogyny\nDear Sir,\nI wish to express my disgust\nwith the beer y\" men\" of the\nUnion Bar, who, on Saturday\n(1th) night, repeatedly hurled obscenities at the women who inadvertently entered that hallowed\nplace. Although I frequent the\nBar, I rarely do so on a Saturday\nevening, so I do not know whether\nthis kind of thing happens often\n\u2014/ suspect that it does. I find\nthe whole idea of a\" males only \"\nbar a little pathetic, but if this\nmust be so I am sure the rudeness\nthat I observed is unnecessary. I suggest that the people concerned\neither grow up or shut- up,\nYours sincerely,\nB.J. BULL (Bot. 3)\nMascots\nDear Sir,\nWe are writing to complain\nabout the incredibly juvenile\nnature of I.C. Union, in that a motion such as that proposed by\nMr. Kearns can be passed, as it\nwas, on a wave of emotion.\nSurely the average I.C. student\nis not so stupid as to just throw\naway the mascot when another\ncollege has taken it. If not, it is\nregrettable that he can be persuaded to vote it away on an\nimpulse. If he will vote like this\non a relatively unimportant mo-tion, the situation seems to have\ndeveloped whereby all that is necessary to get a motion passed is a couple of jokes and a quick vote\nduring the ensuing laughter. This\nseems to us to be a dangerous\nprecedent for future, more vital\nmotions.\nYours faithfully,-R.W. SAXTON,\nJ.C. STOCKBR1DGE, E.E.2. Folk Club\nDear Sir,\nWe read with dismay your Late News article on the Hootenanny\nof 29 October. While we appreciate the writer's concern at the\ncramped conditions of the Television Room, we must add that such\nan atmosphere is, in fact, beneficial to both audience and performers.\nThe former will be more inclined to come again when, perhaps, it is\nless crowded and artistes sing better in an intimate atmosphere than in\na huge bare room where acknowledgement comes through as merely\na whisper. Also, when Bill Clifton last came the ICWA lounge was\nonly half-full.\nThe club committee felt that the bar was in the most advantageous\nposition. It must have been\u2014it went dry\\ It had to be awkward for\nsomeone, particularly* if he happened to be in the far corner of the\nroom. But the other corners constituted exits, at one tickets were\nsold, the other two were adjacent to the stage. Surely, those stalwarts\nwho need multitudinous lubrication to join in the choruses with gusto\nshould place themselves nearer the bar.\nFinally, whose opinion was this? If, as we suspect, it was the\nLN Editor's, then we appreciate his plight. There he was, positioned\nequally well for our bar or the Union's(\" banned \" to him by the\nhordes of Guildsmen) and dying to let his voice soar above all the\nothers. But, next time you express an opinion, please sign it.\nYours faithfully,\nIAN WILLIAMS (Sec. 1CF SQ ROGER FROST (Vice-Pres. ICFSC)\n\n"

    "content": "14 FELIX Hockey : U.L. Cup\nl.C. ROMP THROUGH\nI.C.8 \u20140 Westminster Hospital\nOn November 4th, the I.C. Hockey team gained a convincing\nwin in the first round of the U.L. Cup, beating Westminster Hospital by 8 goals to nil on their home\nground at Cobham. Although for\nthe past two years, the first round\ncup matches have been lost, the\nteam showed no sign of nerves,\nand were soon on the attack; for\nafter only two minutes play, I.C. were one up through an individual\ngoal by right winger Stenning,\nwho put in a fine shot from a very\nnarrow angle.\nFrom that moment on, the\nteam attacked continually. Goals\nfollowed at frequent intervals,\nand half time came with I.C. four\nup from Anketell, Koerner, and\nleft back K. Peters.\nAfter the interval the relentless\npressure on. the Hospital's defence\nwas continued, and two excellent\nshort corner goals by Phillips\nmade the I.C. position impregnable. In the last quarter of an hour,\noutside left Koerner scored his\nsecond goal of the day, which was\nfollowed just before full time by\na goal from E. Castell, who\nscored from one of the many\nshort corners.\nThroughout the match the I.C. defence was scarcely troubled:\nindeed when the final whistle\nblew, goalkeeper E. Needham\nwas still awaiting a chance to\ndemonstrate his full capabilities.\nLuckily he was never tested. I.C. therefore enter the second round\nfull of confidence, for it is the\nfirst time since 1960 (when I.C. last won the cup), that this college really stands a good chance\nof winning this competition.\nTeam : ~E.A. Needham, R.V. Heading, M.K. Peters, G.M. Goddard, R.F. Phillips, E.A. Castell\n(capt.), M.R. Stenning, N.R. Mackenzie, E. Hough, J. Anketell, J. Koerner.\nR.E. Grundy, Hon. Sec. of the\nSoccer Club, who although in-jure d, travels around with the\nteam and provides entertainment\nafter the match.\nIN TOUCH\nCentre' 6\n5 ?\nAT LAST. The Sports Centre of Prim.es Gardens is no longer a nebulous collection of matter (highly charged at that) hovering very\nun stably over the corridors of Westminster, or wherever the University\nGrants Committee sits. The cloud has now congealed but unfortunately drifted, still further up the exponential time curve.\nGeneral plans were accepted in September of this year and more\ndetailed plans have been submitted for approval. After some lightning\nwork by the U.G.C., building could possibly start in the Autumn of\n1965.\nFor those who don't know, the Sports Centre (an idea first mooted\nin 1957) is to be built on the North-West corner of Princes Gardens\nand will consist of a swimming pool, rifle range, four squash courts and\nvarious offices and changing rooms.\nSince early in 1961, when plans were formally submitted by the\nCollege, progress has been painstakingly slow, being a subject of\namusement to all and sundry, (and a useful standby for Council with\nnothing else to talk about).\nNaturally, most people blame the U.G.C. for the delay but the\nCollege and the Union must accept some of the guilt.\nContact between the Development Section of the College and the\nUnion has not been of a very high standard; for instance, the dimensions of the pool were changed six times from 1961-1963, last year\nthe Union had to make extensive enquiries to find out where the\nproject itself had gone.\nA basic difficulty is that Union Officers are elected yearly, whereas\nAdmin, staff are more permanent. Union Officers don't start thinking\nabout problems until they are faced with them, and consequently are\nalways one or more steps behind.\nWe must attempt to make the Union a more professional-like\nbody with officers suitably briefed and knowing in advance what they\nare going to do about specific problems.\nBut now meet\n\" giant-killers,\"\nCE.M in next round.\nSoccer\nForwards must THINK I.C.1 \u20142 L.S.E. From a Roving Reporter\nL.S.E. started the game going\nstraight into attack, and coming\nclose to scoring with a header\nfrom close range. I.C. quickly\nhit back when first Crisp and then\nBentham shot narrowly wide. It\nwas against the run of the play\nwhen L.S.E. scored; a cross from\nthe right was half cleared and\nthen slack marking from the I.C. defence, resulted in the inside\nforward shooting into the corner\nof the net.\nI.C. then began to produce\nsome really excellent football,\nand particularly pleasing at this\nstage was the fluent work of\nEastell and Crisp, whose quick\nchanging of position gave the\nL.S.E. defence much to worry\nabout.\nI.C. equalise d when a move,\ndeveloped by Hunt and Batcup,\nculminated in Kemp's centering\nfor Bentham to shoot into the\nroof of the net.\nAfter the interval I.C. gained\ncomplete control but were often\nat a loss in dealing with a retreating defence which L.S.E. were\noperating extremely efficiently.\nL.S.E.' s second goal was a complete surprise to the I.C. de-fence, a long ball down the middle\nfound L.S.E.' s centre forward\nwho headed a splendid goal.\nWith Eastell going off with an\nankle injury I.C. lost their grip\non the game, although Price\nshowed great enthusiasm in an\neffort to equalise. The I.C. rear-guard seemed shaky in the closing\nstages, when L.S.E. were pressing\nfor a further goal.\nTeam Ratings. Max. 10\nWojtowicz 6, Fairholme 8, Price 3,\nHunt 9i, Johnson 7, Moreland 6, Batcup 6, Bentham 7, Kemp 5, Eastell J, Crisp 12.\nSailing\nThe second team scored a convincing win over Northampton\nCollege first team on November\n7th, winning both races. The\nracing provided interest and\namusement to spectators, who\nwitnessed only three out of six\nboats managing to finish in each\nrace. J. Birchall did well to capsize and still finish first in one of\nthe races.\nThe following Sunday morning,\nthe College took first place in\nboth the London University\npoints races, J. Birchall winning\n\" B\" points and S. Vines, \" A,\" finishing ahead of D. Pentz who\nhad to be content with a second.\nJudo\nSUCCESS TO SUCCESS By J.K. Dugdale\nThe Judo Club, I.C.'s most\nsuccessful sporting organisation\nlast year, seem to be in an even\nstronger position this year. Although rather overcrowded in the\ngymnasium, membership of the\nclub is still increasing. Victories\nwere recorded earlier this term\nover Oxford University (5^-2^),\nand Ealing Technical College\n(2^-i), and amongst the newcomers to the team, Krikor and Sunderland are the most improved.\nMore Wins\nWednesday November 14th saw\nthe start of inter-college Judo in\nLondon. I.C. made an impressive start and are now heading\nthe 1st,2 nd,3 rd and 5th leagues,\na notable victory being that of the\n6th team, which is composed entirely of new members.\nSouthampton Thrashed\nOn Saturday, November 7th a team went to Southampton and\nrecorded a61 win. This was\nachieved in spite of the fact that\ntwo of I.C.'s foremost players did\nnot participate. Nevertheless I.C. produced some good Judo with\nPrescott, Cohen, and Drury out-standing.\n\u2022After the match, I.C.'s superiority was demonstrated when\ntheir two brown belts each beat\na line-up which consisted of the\nwhole Southampton Club.\nOTHER RESULTS\nHockey :\n1st0 \u20142 Guys Hosp.\n1st0 \u20141 U.C.

Once Mines were inside the Prospect\nbeer sales rose considerably, and, by 8.30 p.m., when the Hawaiian\nband arrived, our vocal cords were suitably moistened. The smooth\nmusic soon induced us to vent forth with full bass volume \" Cats \"\nClementine, etc. At first the band was perplexed, they even tried\nto compete, an impossible and foolhardy task, as they soon realised.\nIn the end both band and Minesmen were in unison rendering versions of popular songs not often heard in public.\nClementine II\nRunning beautifully, reports the Motor Club. This was proved\non her run down to Brighton escorting the veteran cars and Bo. On\nthe South Downs a really proud moment came as Clementine II\nswept past J. Surtees and B. Maclaren, who were driving a Sunbeam.\nClem, has had several runs since then, on Morphy Day she\ncarried the tyres and Mines armaments to the battlefield ; more\nrecently Clem, went to Silwood to carry flats for the Mines-Guilds\nCarnival.\nMines-Guilds Carnival\nMines-Guilds Carnival, 20th November, one of the greatest\nnights of the year. Fancy dress : this year's theme is \" The Roaring\n20th or Black Your Bottom\" There is also dancing and cabaret\nand in the later hours of the morning the film \" Some Like It Hot\"\nis being shown. Tickets 25/-.\nGuildfinger\nThe column born of our age,\nreplacing the old Spannerama.\nThe column that gives you the\nnews and views of Guildsmen.\nFreshers' Dinners\nGentlemen, in fact two old\ngentlemen, have been to six din-ner s, and noshed well over 700\nof Mooney's best fare. The\nElectricals lived up to their name,\nand blew all the fuses at their\ndinner. The ladies of Guilds were\nalso entertained by the Executive,\nbut it is one of the biggest problems in Guilds and I.C. that there\nare so few girls.\nMorphy Day\nFirst\u2014Guilds; first\u2014Guilds;\nfirst\u2014Guilds. That was how we\nfinished in the Morphy and Lowry\nRaces, and in the \" Tussle of the\nTyres on the Towpath.\" All three\nvictories were only gained after a hard fight, and to finish with a triple first means that this was one\nof our finest hours. Well done\neverybody, especially the gent\nwith the grey hair who organised\nthe Zebra Crossing crossings.\n(Thousands were not killed as reported in \" Sennet\").\nCarnival\nThe Union Building will once\nmore ring to the happy tune of\nbullets flying as the \" Valentine\nMassacre II \" roars away on 20th November. In other words,\nGuilds have once more organised\nthe Guilds-Mines Carnival for the\n20th, theme \" The Roaring 20's,\" Tickets only 5 dollars from Joe\n\" Lefty \" Collins and his he nch men. Like Hot Some It!\nFilm\nThere are not so many \"social\"\nfunctions in the second term, so it\nhas been decided to invent one.\nOn a certain Saturday in the\nsecond term Guilds and Guildsmen will be making their very\nown film in Hyde Park. Everybody will be featured, so start\nthinking of good stunts that can\nbe recorded for posterity.\nmr\nMorphy Day\nCongratulations, R.C.S., on our victory on Morphy Day (on the\ntowpath not the boat races). Guilds will indubitably claim victory\nbut we had to get our tyres whereas Guilds only had to sit on theirs.\nAlso the surplus trousers ratio was five to one in our favour.\nOne thing most people agree on, it was the best Morphy Day\nfor years. I wonder what the police think ?\nThe last word I think should come from Dave Royle (the\ncasualty) who on being asked if he was going to Morphy Day next\nyear replied, \" Of course.\"\nSmoking Concert\nTo-morrow week. One free pint of beer, and sub sidi sed rates\nafter that. With tickets at only 3/- you can't lose.

Des Kearns, President of Mines,\nthereupon proposed that it be presented to the Cantabrians, in whose\npossession it already was, describing it as \" a gro tty mascot totally\nunworthy of Imperial College.\" Continued on p.16 CONCUSSION HITS FRESHER\nWednesday, 4th November\nA first-year Physics student,\nDavid Royle, brought a sudden\nhalt to the traditional festivities\non the towpath at Putney to-day,\nwhen he hit his head on a stone\nand remained unconscious for ten\nminutes. With blood streaming\ndown the left side of his face he\nwas carried to an ambulance and\nrushed to hospital believed to be\nsuffering from concussion.\nA grim end to what was generally considered one of the best\nMorphy Day punch-ups. Attendance was poor\u2014120 RCS, 120\nGuilds, 30 Mines. The wind was\nstrong and cold off the river at\nhigh tide. These two facts were,\nperhaps, main contributors to the\nbest towpath revelries for at least\nthree years.\nPUBLIC RELATIONS GOOD\nThe police did not intervene\nuntil asked for, and then only to\ndeal with the injury. Throughout\nthe fight three constables stood a hundred yards away with a crowd\nof onlookers.\nPublic relations showed an im-prove ment. Many, in particular\nLondon Transport staff, showed\nindignation, but the majority appreciated the rag as something\nof a joke.\nBIAS AGAINST MINES ?\nGuilds won not only the fight\nfor the tyres (they collected 4\nagainst RCS's3 and Mines' 1) but\nalso both the Lowry and Morphy\nboat races. In the former they\nbeat Mines by two lengths (RCS\ntrailed far behind).\nThe start of the Morphy was\ndelayed half-an-hour while the\nriver was cleared ot snipping.\nSoon after the start, however, the\nMines crew lost their rhythm\nsaving their boat from dissection\nby an oil tanker. In failing light\nGuilds again narrowly clinched\nthe cup from Mines, who maintained that the race should have\nbeen restarted.\nAll'swell.., A hospital examination on Dave\nRoyle confirmed concussion.\nHis parents were informed and\ncame to London, but he was back\nin college the next day.\nD.I. W,. Dr. Eleanor Mears' summing-up that \" The Church, of necessity, has to lag behind public opinion,\" was well exemplified at Thursday's disappointing Union Debate. For Father Corbishly, SJ., could\noffer only conscience as an alternative solution for the motion that\n\" Artificial contraception is not the answer to the world population\nsolution.\" The house defeated the motion by 113 votes to 42 against,\nwith 35 abstentions.\nWhile' Dr. Mears exhibited the dignity expected of her sex and\nFather Corbishly of his profession, their second ers snarled like starving dogs over the scraps and loose ends of the other side's case. Only\nDr. Mears could offer any concrete answers, being, as a member of\nthe Family Planning Association, intimately involved in research on\noral contraceptive pills and their most recent success, plastic intrauterine devices. The F.P. A. have been alone in surveying the population problem; in the words of Lady Gaitskell, \" It doesn't wait\nfor politicians and prelates\"\nNATURAL AND MAN-MADE SOLUTIONS\nThe \" natural\" alternatives appeared to be to let \" All these\ntiresome people . . . keep on multiplying \" and then feed their hungry\nmouths with divine providence.\nContinued on p.16 MASCOTS IN DISPUTE\nFriday, midday\nAn extraordinary Union General Meeting has been proposed\nto contest the decision of 5th November to adopt the Queen's Tower as IC mascot. Dick Conn\nand John Baker suggest that a Victorian gas lam post, mounted\nin concrete and painted in IC\ncolours, be placed in the middle\nof Beit Quadrangle!\nSupport will no doubt be obtained in their petition for the\nmeetings and later with the Union\nmembers accepting the change\nof mascots. But it is highly unlikely that the Governing Body\nwill give official sanction to the\nmove. So IC, it appears, will be\nmascot less, as Des Kearns originally moved in the last Union\nMeeting.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX13 Burmese Evening\nDear Sir,\nThe account of the Burmese Evening by your reporter in the\nLate News sheet was most misguided. Did he seriously think the\nshow was to be a Broadway production! Was he not aware that:\n(1) All twenty-six performers who took part were amateurs, performing free.\n(2) Rehearsals could not be carried out as most of the performers live\na considerable distance away from London, so were unfamiliar with\nstage layout.\n(3) Only one quarter of the available space on the stage could be used,\nas the rest of it was filled with the Dram. Soc's stage props for their\nforthcoming show, piano, chairs etc. etc.\nYour reporter seems to have a very knowle ge able idea of stage\nmanagement\u2014so if we have another show of this sort, maybe he will be\nwilling to stage manage it for us\\\nRegarding the food, all I can say is that although we provided\nit, it was not prepared by us.\nYours faithfully,\nNAY HTUN\n(Chem. Eng. P.G.) Another\nViewpoint\nDear Mr. Walker,\nOn behalf of the Britain-Burma\nSociety Is lio ul d like to thank you\nfor the interest shown by \"Felix\"\nin the recent Burmese Evening at\nthe college. I consider the writeup in the Felix Late News to be\nvery fair\u2014even the reference to\nthe \" bumbling stage management \" which we regretfully admit\nto be true.\nYours sincerely,\nH.E. GOTO (Zoology)\n(Joint Hon. Sec, Britain-Burma\nSociety)\nAdvertising\nDear Sir,\nWe were dismayed to learn of a proposal by the Union hierarchy\nto restrict advertising in the\nUnion (and later, in Southside)\nto the extent of permitting only\n10\" by 8\" posters, probably rolled\nup and secreted in pigeonholes.\nTrue, the Union is cluttered with\na large number of bad posters,\nbut surely most of these are concerned with external affairs?\nIf they were removed the space\navailable for college advertising\nwould be doubled, and a system\nof censorship could be set up to\nweed out the scrappier internal\nposters.\nOur particular interest in this\naffair arises from the problem of\nadvertising for the Folk Song\nClub, which relies on catching the\nattention of non-members (regular\nattendance 120, members only 50\nat beginning of term). How can\nwe advertise people like Bill\nClifton and Ian Campbell on\ntoilet-paper?\nWe suggest that there is ample\nroom for well-designed 15\" by 12\"\ndisplays, provided they are allowed to be put up for a limited\nperiod, say, 7 days. There are\nmany posters that have remained\non t lie board since the beginning\nof term.\nYours, in anger,\nC.C. WRIGHT (Civ. Eng. 3)\nBRIAN BULL (Botany 3)\nAPOLOGY\nWe regret certain errors in the\nreporting of the Burmese Evening in the last issue. In part icu lar, a caption on page 9 indicating a gentleman to be Sir Hubert\nRanee, the last Governor of\nBurma. He was, in fact, Mr.\nJohn Pringle, a member of the\nBritain-Burma Society. Sir\nHubert was at the last moment\nunable to attend.\nMisleading Dear Sir,\nThe comment in your last Late\nNews sheet about bad attendance\nin the debate with Kings was mis-leading. At least half of the\npeople present left around 2.30\nwit li out voting (presumably to get\nto the lectures). The attendance\nwas about 100. Whoever reported\nthe debate to you presumably did\nnot point this out; hence your unfortunate comment. Arrangements are being made to allow\npeople to vote as they leave if\nthey wish to leave a debate before\nit has finished.\nYours faithfully,\nR.J. KIRK (Physics)\nMorphy Day Dear Editor,\nI went to my first Morphy Day\nas a photographer, and thus had\nample opportunity to see what\nwas going on. It is traditionally\na day for a punch-up, and nobody\nwill complain at students letting\noff their high spirits provided that\nit does not affect anybody else.\nBut can there be any excuse for\nthe li old up of traffic produced\nafterwards ? I think not. This is\nno more nor less than gaining\none's pleasure at seeing others'\ninconvenience\u2014an utterly selfish\nthing to do. Done once a year\nor otherwise, there can be no\njustification for this\u2014Morphy\nDay celebrations ought to be confined to inter-student activities,\nand not be at the expense of the\ngeneral public.\nYours sincerely,\nN.W. STATON-BEVAN\n(Phy. 1)\nTO TEACH IS TO CREATE\nFrom the time of Socrates, teachers have made\nat least as important a contribution to society's progress as the statesmen, i he inventors and\nthe artists. Their influence is now wider, their\nresponsibilities greater than ever before. Today\neducation offers a creative career of increasing\nscope, in which people of ie'e as and initiative\ncan use their talents and attainments to the full.\nMany exciting new things are happening in the\neducation service . . . things in which you might\ntake part.

ANAND'S TROUSERS\nThere was little opposition-Uppi Anand, Chairman of SCC,\nsuggested that Mr. Kearns should\nat the same time give away the\nMines' mascot. The Deputy\nPresident, Barry Mair, retorted,\n\"If Mr. Anand is to be so\ngenerous . . . he should also give\na wav his trousers.\"\nWhen the uproar had lulled,\nMr. Price gave his considered\nopinion\u2014\" A very fair amendment but it interferes with personal freedom.\"\nA number of problems will\nhave to be ironed out before the\nTower fully adopts its new status.\nOne, as Kish Sadhvani, President\nof RCS, mentioned, is the matter\nof mascot bearers. Perhaps that\negghead of-Victoriana, Mr. John\nBetjeman, can help.\nSCHOLARSHIPS TO\nHONG KONG\nA more important item on the\nagenda was Mr. Mair's proposal\nthat collections be made to provide two \u00a350 scholarships sponsored by the World University\nService for Chinese students to go\nto Hong Kong University.\nFrank Fuchs, well-known\nCommunist, and John Tutelman,\nwell-known Jew, wished that our\ngift have the official recognition\nof the British High Commissioner\nin Hong Kong- Their amendment was defeated\u2014there is no\nHigh Commissioner!\nConcern was also expressed regarding any political aspects of\nWUS and on the methods of raising the \u00a3100. Mr. Mair assured\nthe audience of WUS's non-affiliation and Mr. Price had made\ncertain that the money would not\nbe used to cover administrative\ncosts, adding, \" If the cause is\nworth supporting then you will\nsupport it personally.\" He declared the motion \" carried absolutely overwhelmingly.\"\nHUNT TO COUNCIL\nDave Hunt, Felix Sports Editor, defeated Keith Cavanagh, the\nnotable left-winger, to become\nan RCS representative on Council\nby 185 votes to 151. Pete Jones,\nof Physics 2, was unopposed for\nthe vacancy on the Entertainments Committee.\nNo nominations had been put\nforward for Carnival Organiser,\nso possible charities were not dis-cussed. Council's decision to\nextend Union bar licensing hours\nwas welcomed ; but criticism was\nlevelled at Council for the lack of\nadvertising for the Meeting.\nLITTLE BOXES\nDr. Weale, the Treasurer, bewildered the congregation with\nhis summary of the Union's financial situation. Showing a profit for last year, his report was\naccepted, and his work appreciated. The Secretary, Barry Utting,\nannounced that a team had been\nformed by Bill MacAuley, last\nyear's editor of Phoenix, to compete in ITV's University Challenge in Manchester on 12th November. But even his monotone was forced to break in face\nof tittering s to his explanation of\nhow a lot of little Oxfam boxes\nhad disintegrated in transit.\nD. IW.\nFrom page 1\nCONTRACEPTION\nThe audience, however, were more convinced by Dr. Mears'\ncontention that the present population explosion has been caused by\nman as a result of medical advance. In the Western world this has\nbeen a slow process over a century and the new pattern of life, with\nsmaller families and longer life has been gradually introduced.\nIn the underdeveloped countries, Adrian Fletcher, then created a where until very recently the\ndeath rate has been high, medicine has been thrust upon the\npopulace. Their death rate has\nLondon smog, out of which the\nlatter emerged with a three-point\nplan. This called for improved\nfood production, contraception,\nbeen dramatically reduced, but and space research\nthe birth rate has not been\naffected. The meeting affirmed\nthat this man-made problem must\nbe treated in another man-made\nmanner.\nA LONDON SMOG\nAfter Clerald Mulholland,\nPresident of UL U Debates, and\nMaurice English, Chairman of\nNorman Price's level-headed\ncomment that \" For a thing to be\na solution, it doesn't have to be\nthe only solution\u2014it has to be the\nbest one\" was a welcome relief\nafter such rubbish thrown from\nthe Concert Hall stage as Mr.\nMulholland's statement that he\ndid not believe in predictions\nthe National Schools Debating (when they were offered by the\nCompetition, had succeeded in other side) and later using one to\ncasting a haze over the whole further his own case,\nmotion, it was left to the floor to D.I.

Tuesday was not much\nbetter\u2014the students do not seem\nto be so enthusiastic after all.\nThe sad side of the affair is the\ntreatment the barmen have re-ce i ved. The first Howard, the\nUnion Barman, heard of the\nchanges was from the students\nafter the Union meeting. When\nhe went to Mr. Seaford to enquire\nabout this, he was handed a letter\nwhich simply restated that the\nbarmen had always been expected\nto work until 11 every night at\nthe discretion of the duty officer.\n\u2014now the bar would be kept open\nregardless.\nAlthough, in this letter, sympathy was registered at the hardship involved and they were\nawarded an increase in pay, this\nis disgraceful treatment of men\nwho have the interests of the\nstudents at heart. The only reason\nHoward has not left (which he has\nthreatened to do many times) is\nbecause he knows that the college\nwill not be able to find another\nbarman, and because he genuinely\nenjoys working for us. However,\nhe is an old man, and this might\nbe pushing things too far.\nBy law, barmen are supposed\nto have 1J days off each week; but\nours only get one day o if a fort-night. In the light of this, there-fore, it is unfortunate that the\nchanges have been implemented\nso heavy-handedly, for they are\npeople we simply cannot afford\nto lose.\nAs a postscript, it is sad that we\nhave lost Jim from Southside; nobody ever seems to stay there very\nlong.\nLORD MAYOR'S SHOW\nGuilds in prominence\nLf i,i \u2022t MM j \u00bb\n*-4 -,s.

    "content": "FELIX3 COUNCIL CARRIES\nI.C. Union Council began sitting at 5.45, Tuesday, 3rd November. Six hours and many cigarettes later it was still sitting\u2014and\ntalking, but by that time all but the stalwart orators had fallen into\na somnolent silence. Much of the time in between was spent in\narguing about trivialities, occasionally checked by the Chairman,\nMr. Price, and complaints from Mrs. Robb, whose exceptional\npatience was stretched to its limits towards midnight.\nOf the subjects of importance discussed, two were Council regulars\u2014College Bar hours and car parking facilities.\nANAND UNDER FIRE\nThe financial estimates of the\nACC and RCC were passed without much quibbling but the SCC\nhad more trouble.\nThe methods by which the Debating Society obtained \u00a350 for\ndebating lessons (badly needed !)\ncame under fire. Mr. Price objected to their seeking money\nfrom General Studies, behind\nCouncil's back. Mr. Anand replied that, rather than risking\nCouncil refusing his request, he\nwas forced to find the money\nelsewhere. Much discussion ensued in which it was pointed out\nthat it was preferable to obtain\nmoney from Council, rather than\nany other body, as only in the\nformer case was the money student controlled.\nAfter a muddle with motions\nand amendments, the following\nwas passed : that Societies should\nnot accept money from sources,\nother than Council, unless under\nspecial circumstances, to be decided by the executive of the\nSCC\nSCHROTER DISAPPOINTS\nA report by Mr. Schroter on\nthe Car Parking and Traffic Committee was thoroughly di sap pointing. At the Council meeting in February he had reported\nthat the Committee was looking\ninto the problem carefully. Eight\nmonths and five committee meetings later, all he could say was\nthat they were still looking into\nit (still carefully, I suppose), but\nthat no positive action had been\ntaken. He then emphasised the\nimportance and urgency of parking facilities being included, while\nthere were still building plans\nbeing drawn up. The inactivity\nwas blamed on the Chairman of\nthe Committee, Mr. Stevenson,\nand it was generally decided to\nmake him \" pull his finger out\"\nwith a representation by Mr.\nPriceCHEERS AND MOANS\nThe ever-increasing topic of\nbar hours then arose and without\nany trouble, a motion was\npassed, allowing the College bars\nto remain open until 11 p.m. on\nweek-days and 10.30 p.m. on\nSundays.\nThe proposition by the Executive that ordinary Council members should take their turn in the\nUnion Offices at lunchtime, was\nmet with groans (not of fatigue\n\u2014yet) from those concerned, but\nsomehow the motion was passed.\nREPORT BY\nPETER COMBES\nPASSING ON BLAME Then followed a very welcome\ninterval when everybody repaired\nto the bar. The pints consumed\nwere not enough, unfortunately,\nto liven the second half which became decidedly tedious.\nThere was present the I.C. Sennet agent, to whom a complaint was made concerning the\ninaccuracy of the reporting on\nI.C. He smartly passed the\nblame on the two I.C. men (one\na Fresher) who report for Sennet,\nand no satisfactory conclusion\nwas reached.\nINNOVATIONS\nCouncil expressed concern over\nmidweek entertainments- Last\nyear's South Side Stomps had\nshown that organised midweek\nevents were welcome. The evening of October 29th had demanded expert rearrangement to fit in\nso many activities into the Union.\nA committee will be set up to investigate planned midweek enter-tain ment. This year's Union \" blue book\"\nhas turned up six weeks late. A printer has offered to produce\nthis annually on the lines of the\nUL U Handbook free of charge\u2014\nhe would arrange the advertising\nhimself. Chris Tye is to invest i gate.\nAt seven mi nut qs to twelve the\nmeeting drew wearily to a close,\nrather from lack of stamina than\nfrom any lack of trivialities to\ndiscuss.\nCentral Electricity Generating Board\nhas a great future to offer...\nThe Board's ENGINEERING\nTRAINING\nSCHEME\nOpens up exceptional\ncareer opportunities for\nELECTRICAL\nENGINEERS\nMECHANICAL\nENGINEERS\nPHYSICISTS\nTWO YEARS TRAINING. For those with good\nhonours degrees, this will be a general engineering training, including one year with a manufacturer, basic workshop training and experience in\nall aspects of the Board's engineering operations.\nThose with other degrees can be trained in Generation, Transmission or Design and Construction,\nwith 6 months spent at a manufacturers.\nPay during training: 1st and 2nd Class honours\ndegrees \u00a3875 in the first year, and \u00a3925 in the\nsecond year.

The main causes of\nthe loss being \u00a3148 for a natty\nU.L. U. badge on the cover and\n\u00a330 for the inclusion of the Union\nconstitution. What of the Editor\nresponsible?-!^ left for Sweden!\nUNIVERSITY COLLEGE\nTHEFTS\nIt is estimated that \u00a34 10s. Od.\nis stolen daily from students at\nUniversity College. Furthermore\n\u00a3240 worth of cutlery and \u00a3100\nworth of glasses are stolen from\nthe refectory per term.\nKEELE MEAL SCANDAL\nStudents at Keele have to produce identity cards, bearing their\nphotographs, in order to be\nserved in their refectories.\u2014Why?\n\u2014Because the Senate have decided to enforce this measure to\nprevent students committing the\nheinous offence of eating in a hall\nof residence other than their own.\nCHELSEA FLOPS\nChelsea college has an average\npass rate of less than 50 per cent.\nThe rates for individual degrees\narc as follows: \u2014\nB.

(Physics)\u201455 rer cent.\nTHE VANISHING C JLLEGE\nAccording to the N.U.S. handbook for London Students there\nis no such place as I.C. It gives\na full and comprehensive list of\nUniversity Colleges, C.A.T's, medical schools and other colleges but nowhere is there a mention of I.C. It's like the U.S.A. refusing, in theory, to admit the\nexistence of 600 million Chinese\nbecause they aren't in the United\nNations.\nPARAGUAYAN PROTEST\nParaguayan students are protesting against entrance exams to\nuniversities !\nWATCH YOUR LANDLADY !\nTwo third-year students at\nManchester University^gave their\nlandlady an \u00a318 retainer for the\nsummer vac- They returned this\nterm to find the home sold and\nthe new owner knowing nothing\nof any agreement or money.\nA MATTER OF MORALS\nKing's College have a\" Moral\nGuidance Officer,\" elected by\ntheir Union Council.
