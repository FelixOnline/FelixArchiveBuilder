    "content": "FELIX11 RUGBY Gup Hopes Crushed by Kings\nI. C3 KINGS 5\n\u2014 By a Felix Staff Reporter \u2014\nI.C. went out of the Gutteridge\nCup Wednesday before last when\nthey lost to a more balanced\nKings side which took advantage\nof its brief domination of the game\nin the first half and then closed the\ndoor on I.C. until the very last\nminute of time. The King's try\ncame in the 25th minute from a copy book three quarter movement\nstarting at the halfway Tine and\nending almost under the posts. It\nwas easily converted.\nFrom the restart, however,\nI.C. moved the game into the\nKing's half and there it remained,\nmore or less, for the rest of the\nmatch. The I.C. pack were getting possession from nearly every\nline out and set scrum, and completely overwhelming Kings in\nthe loose, but the services rendered ,by their backs appeared\nordinary at the best of times and\nwas the real cause of I.C.'s inability to turn this territorial advantage into goals. Their passing\nwas generally \u2022 sloppy, especially\nin the half backs, and the pass was\ntoo often made before the opposing man had been drawn.\nUNLUCKY To be fair, the I.C. three quarters produced some exciting\nmovements from which they were\njn lucky not to score. Two of\n:he se, in the 35th and 64th, min-ute s, resulted in Churchill going\nover the line only to hear the\nwhistle blow for some previous\ninfringement. But they came all\ntoo rarely in proportion to the\nnumber of openings created by\nthe forwards.\nI.C. SCORE\nIn the third minute of the\nsecond half, Ravno hit the post\nwith a penalty kick, and it was not\nuntil the 80th minute of play that\nI.C. finally managed to score\nwhen the forwards took command\nof a five yard scrum, and surged\nover the King's goal line to touch\ndown and narrow their opponents\nlead to two points.\nLAST DITCH\nThe conversion attempt, by\nRavno from a very difficult angle,\nwent wide and short, but in the\nseemingly unending period of\ninjury time which followed, I.C. threw everything they had into\nattack. No sooner did one movement end than another started and\nonly a last ditch covering by\nKings prevented the final result\nfrom going to I.C. One cannot help wondering if,\nhad I.C. used the forward rush\ntactics of these dying minutes\nmore earlier in the game, they\nwould not have won the match\nhandsomely.\nAbove: Speedy winger Churchill\nkicks ahead. Below: The I.C. forwards about\nto take possession from a line-oat\nSOCCER\nFIRST LEAGUE WIN I.C.2L. S.E.1 The first team played L.S.E. at home knowing that they must\nwin all four remaining matches to\nhave a chance of avoiding re lega tion. The addition of three University players (as London were\nwithout a game) boosted hopes of\na victory.\nI.C. attacked fluently from the\nstart and after only ten minutes\nwere one up as Kemp held off two\ntackles to score from a through\nball., Chances abounded on the\nslippery surface but the home\nteam, after crossing the ball well,\nlacked finish, and the Beavers\nwere held by an I.C. defence of\nunusual solidarity. Cox came\nclose to scoring when his first time\nshot was stopped by an L.S.E. full\nback on the line, but half time was\nreached without addition to the\nscore.\nThe second half found I.C. still\nin command and after continually\npressing White volleyed a goal\nafter crisp inter passing. After\nFisher had hit the back of the net\nagain L.S.E. started to have more\nof the ball and 10 minutes from\nthe end pulled back to 2:1. I.C. defence became a little panicky\nand the final whistle was a welcome sound.\nOf the Lower Teams\nThe Illrd are in to the semifinal of the reserves cup after a good win over King's II, 2 : 0\nand play Q.M.

    "content": "FELIX9 SOUTH SIDE\nI am fed up with the trash and\nill-informed gossip printed in your\ncolumns on this subject. The final\nstraw was the Colcutt comment in\nyour last edition.\nThe possibility of an Oxbridge\nsystem arising in Southside is so\nremote that it is purely of academic interest to defeat this pro-pos al. Suffice it to say that if such\na system seemed imminent, 98\nper cent of the residents, including\nmyself, would leave the halls im-mediate ly. With no residents the\nhalls could not operate.\nColcutt raises the issues of the\nWarden's powers. Within limits\nthe wardens are free to run the\nHalls as they like. However, if\nthey overstep the mark, they are\nsubject to: open rebellion by the\nstudents, i( e.g. the famous \"12\no 'clock \" rule), the halls commit-tee, and finally they are responsible to the Rector.\nColcutt has fought shy since the\nFuch's episode of warning people,\nplaces, etc. I think, in general,\nhe has one warden in mind, Dr.\nCameron; let him give his reasons,\nand perhaps he will make his\npoint. If he is against the system\nof wardens to control halls, then\nhe must consider the only alternative\u2014a student committee. After\nseeing the confusion, red herrings,\nand personal animosity which\naccompanied the N.U.S. business\nlast year, I have my doubts about\nstudent committees. I approve of\nhaving the union building and its\nfacilities run by students, but I do not want my home run by stu-dents.\nIt is inevitable that some social\nactivity should be centred in the\nhalls themselves\u2014after all, they\nare the communities in which we\nlive. The student who lives in digs\nis not censored if he goes to his\nlocal cinema or pub. Why should\nnot the residents of the halls be\ngiven the same freedom? There\nare groups of people in Southside\nwith common interests, who meet\nat (ir)regular intervals. Whether\nor not they are \" Clubs \" within\nthe Union definition I do not\nknow, but they all represent\nminority interests. Is the Union\ninterested in groups of people who\nmake brass-rubbing s or push\nping-pong balls around with their\nnoses? If it is, it should adopt\nthese societies into its own organisation and have done with it. It\nis interesting that the Physics department started the Wooden\nHorse Club)\u2014an admirable group\nand received the full blessing of\nthe Union, whereas any Southside\nclub is immediately condemned.\nGentlemen of IC, please remember that that strange animal,\nthe Southside dweller, is not a warden's minion but a member of\nour Union. We want to act as\nUnion members, not only individually, but also corporate ly. The friction between the Union\nand Southside is not that great,\nand could be removed, if muck\nstirrers take the trouble to get the\nfacts straight before venturing\nforth into long spiels. You are\nthe Union; you decide.\nP.H. COLLINS\nSouthside\nTwo Views\nThe Imperial College system is\nchanging ; we are ceasing to be\na day-college and are gradually\nbecoming a residential University. It is time that the Union\nbecame aware of this and stopped\nbleating \" Beware of Oxbridge\nand Cameron.' That the future\nof I.C. lies with the Halls and not\nin the Constituent Colleges'\nUnions is a view held more\nwidely than is generally supposed ;; the question is, how can\nthe Union adapt itself to this inevitable change ? The great\nfear is that the Wardens will grab\nfinancial control and could assume dictatorial powers. If the\nUnion is all that it claims to be\n(and it has already shown itself\nmore than capable in this dire c tion) then this could not possibly\nhappen.\nThe best way in which to\nrealise the potential of these\nHalls will be to automatically\nattach every member of College\nto a particular Hall; all should\nbe encouraged to spend at least\none year in it, but this is not es-sent i al. Each Hall could then\nselect teams, or have its own\nclubs and functions\u2014not all that\nradical, it happens at present.\nThe major clubs would remain\nI.C.U. clubs, and all would receive financial support and control from this source. The possibilities are endless, and they\nwould all induce far greater\ncorporate participation than we\nhave at the moment. Only the\nshortest-sighted will fail to see\nthat this is where our future lies.\nEven if it does smell vaguely of\nOxbridge, it is the best of that\nsystem, and does not include the\nmore unpleasant trimmings;\nthere is no reason why it should.\nFootnote: In a long term financial view of the Union drawn\nup by the Executive last term,\nprovision has been made for\ninter-hall sport.\nJ.

    "content": "6 FELIX EDITORIAL\" IT IS HARD TO KICK AGAINST THE PRICKS \"\nIf you don't change your editorial policy pretty soon we w Sl have no alternative but to find another editor. These were in effect,\nthe last words of the President, Dave Watson, at a Felix board meeting last week. This was the climax to over an hour of heated argument during which Massey, Union Secretary, said at one point,\n\" print what you like, but you must report Council.\" The point the\nboard were making (though in all fairness, not all of them) was that\nin some mysterious way we are responsible for a failing Union. By\nnot publishing an account of last year's Council meeting now, we\nhave seriously affected Union participation. Only eighteen months\nago we were not allowed to report Council at all; now it seems we\nhave to.\nTo the President Felix has been disappointing, disillusioning,\nand in short, something of a failure. This is sad. His remedy it\nappears would be to publish all Union news regardless of content or\ntopical it y and in this way create a thriving Union ; this might well be\nso, but for a readership of net much more than three hundred. To\nbe successful Felix must be lively, controversial and informative. We\nare fortunate indeed that Union news is not all that is available.\nAt the beginning of the meeting a request was made to allow\ntwo Felix staff members to attend for the reasons put forward here\nlast issue. Some felt that this was quite unnecessary and that the\neditor could comfortably deal with the eight others. When a vote\nwas taken one abstained through self-confessed ignorance. How is\nit that someone can sit on this board who admits complete ignorance,\nwhile attempts are made to exclude better informed members of the\nnewspaper staff.\nThe talk of resignation comes after what Watson calls repeated,\nunpardonable omissions, and lapses jn taste. Last term we were\ntorn apart for being destructively critical; now the President and\nSecretary don't care what we say as long as we say something. Even\n\" rotten Council\" is better than nothing. This sort of inconsistency\ni \u2022 hard to follow, as is Watson's repeated cry that the paper should\nbe wholly independent, but of course must fit in with Union wishes.\nENOUGH INTERFERENCE\nA further suggestion at the meeting was that a Council report\nshould occupy at least half a page, and that last term's Union meeting was covered inadequately\u2014even though it did make the front\npage This, of course, would mean excluding other things. The people\nwho are really interested would in both cases be there anyway, and\nfor those who aren't,a\" sparse account\" would be more than\nenough.\n\"6w tl x wov tbs i CYtltU tft lf Rvi ot) the s evey th* \u2014\"\nThe first of the Fashion House's Collections have been on view in\nthe last few weeks. Although the\nclothes shown are for the most\npart extravagant and unrealistically expensive, it is worth every\ngirl's while looking at the new\nlines and ideas conceived by the\nFashion Barons, for these are the\nclothes that will influence the\nchain stores when they come to\nproduce their budget clothes for\nthe summer.\nFemininity\nThe first clear cut result to\nemerge from the various Collections is that the Cathy Gale black\nleather look will melt away as\nquickly\u00ab. s next month's snow, and\nits place will be taken by the\npretty, yet elegant, feminine\nclothes that the Englishwoman\nwears so well; clear bright col-ours, and a revival of the Empire\nline will make themselves felt in\nhigh-waist ed seams, braiding or\ntrimming on otherwise loosely\nfitting dresses and coats.\nPleas (e)! Why do so many Icwardians\ncome td College looking as though\nthey choose their selection of\nclothes for the day with their\neyes shut\u2014fancy sweaters with\npatterned skirts, tartan skirts etc.?\nI am in favour of wearing com-ft\nfor table and even moderately old\nclothes to College, but at least\nwear clothes that match.\nAnd please, please, girls, find\nthe two minutes in the morning\nthat is all you need to apply a little makeup. Thanks to Rimmel\nand Outdoor Girl, cosmetics are\nwithin the reach of even the most\nstringent /budget, and that you\nare outnumbered by men is no\nreason to loose your fem in it y \u2014all\nthe more reason to preserve it.\nYou spend most of your time in\nCollege so you may as well make\nthe most of it and not keep makeup and smart clothes for extra-collegiate hours. Female students\nhave long had a reputation for\nbeing scruffy, sloppy and untidy.\nIsn't it time we repudiated it?\nMore than 80 people came to\nthe second Hootenanny organised\nby the newly-recognised IC Folk\nClub on Tuesday, 21st January.\nThis evening of folk-song, even\nmore successful than last term's, was again comp ered by Folk\nClub president Brian Bull.\nIn the subdued light of the\nICWA lounge, established acts\nlike the Wayfarers and the Chris\nWright Blues Group made small\ncontributions being only too\npleased to give leeway to new\ntalent of great diversity. On the\ninternational scene, Sam Apeji\ndelighted with songs from his\nnative Nigeria, Mr. Dragon gave\nus some Jugoslav love ballads,\nDai Evans sang unaccompanied\nin his native tongue about Welsh\ngoatherds, and Jim Bloomer used\nhis authentic accent to render a number of American folk songs.\nAmong the gathering there were\nguests from other colleges : Chelsea provided Elvina, Judy, Colin\nand Ricky whose programme\nvaried from humour to protest;\nKate and Ros made a return visit\nfrom Westfield to do several English and foreign songs ; singing\nand playing Czechoslovakian and\nRussian numbers was Ivana, a music student; and organ-builder\nRoy Grubb introduced the audience to the lute and also showed\n1 is worth on the guitar.\nTalent in IC\nThe show was, however, dominated both by local talent and by\ntunes sung in English. Trev contributed blues numbers, Pat and\nMike harmon is ed in their own\nunique way, and Zoology technicians Rod and Alex proved their\nsuperiority over Robin H. and\nJimmie MacG. Members of the\nChris. Wright Group demonstrated their virtuosity on banjo,\nbanja lin, harmonica, and a homemade mouthpiece as well as on\nguitars.\nAltogether, an action-packed\nevening of over three hours\nmusic performed live, broken\nonly for 15 minutes at half-time,\nand with all performers only too\neager to give more songs than\ntime would allow. Audience\nparticipation in the better-known\nsongs, especially the final num-be rs, was vociferous and must\nsurely have climaxed everyone's enjoyment on the Hootenanny.\nAn evening spent in any Folk\nClub is a rare and wonderful ex-peri en ce. At I.C. you are fortunate to have such a flourishing\nclub, and you would be well advised to make the effort to come\nto the next Hootenanny planned\nfor mid-February \u2014watch for\nnotices. D.I.

The Tory party wants \" to be\njudged both by the coherence of\nits plans for the Future and er\n. . . past achievements,\" according to Mr. Maudling who spoke\nat Imperial College last Tuesday.\nIn a somewhat disappointing\nspeech to a packed audience in the\nPhysics building, Mr. Maudling\ngathered from the newspapers,\n(\" whom we ought to believe \")\nthat an election was imminent, so,\nas part of his pre-election cam-pa ign, he decided to speak on\nInternal and Home affairs.\n\"Essential programmes must be\nconsistent with economic reality.\"\nThe sort of ambitious rate of\ngrowth which can be achieved is a4 per cent long term increase in\nthe national income. At present\nwe are rising at 5\\ per cent, so\nwatch out, the squeeze will be\ncoming. Disregarding this dark\ncloud on the horizon for the mo-ment, the economic situation today is one of progress. Education\ntakes up 3 - 4 per cent of the\nbudget and will soon rise to 5 per\ncent as it is increasing all the time.\nExpenditure on roads is going up\nby 12 per cent on last year, but\nwhat it was last year we were not\ntold . . . I wonder why?\nThe ten year hospital programme is under way and then of\ncourse, there is housing, while the\nsocial benefits have gone up more\nthan incomes. Old people continue to share the Wealth of\nBritain. We spend exactly ten\ntimes as much on defence as we\ndo on education, but a defence\ncut is not feasible in the light of\nBritish prestige, depreciation\nabroad and other factors. We\nmust also look toward the poorer\ncountries as already the Common\nMarket countries are giving them\nmore aid per capita than we are.\nThe Labour party must be\npressed to give a financial account\nof its plans, they are probably a bit over ambitious. Britain's limiting factor is the availability of\nskilled manpower, which must in-dictate that all our unemployed are\nunskilled. During question time,\nMr. Maudling, who is due for a4,000 per cent, increase in pay\njudging by national income sta-tis tics, refused to comment on the\npresent editor of the Spectator!\nMICHAEL SOMMER\nWRITES\nHAROLD WILSON... PHOTOS BY CHRIS HUSSELL\nMr. Jo Grimond, the head of\nthe Liberal party, spoke to another packed main physics lecture\ntheatre on Thursday on the Political Scene.\nIn a much more lively strain\nthan Mr. Maudling on Tuesday,\nhe went straight to the roots of\npolitics by saying, \" Unless you\nreform politics in this country, it\nis very unlikely that the politicians\ncan reform anything else.\" At the\nelection the main issues in\npolitics should be discussed, but\nthere is danger that all the main\nissues will be avoided.\nUsually the argument is how to\nspend someone else's money. The\nquestion should not be \" how\nmuch Nuclear Power we want to have \" but, \" how much conventional power are you willing to\npay for.\" Also, \" whether you\nwant expansion by simple debasement of currency.\" Politics must\nbecome scientific, scientists are becoming respectable, while engineers have some way to go.\nThe Houses of Parliament\nsimply have to be modernised. \"It\nis wholly illogical to concentrate\nso much power into such an ine--ff ici ent organization as the House\nof Commons, who refuse even to\nbe televised.\nDON'T YOU!\nWHILE GOD HAS HIS\nPROPHETS . . .\nWhile God has his prophets the\nTory Party has its Royal Commissions. It takes a G.C.E. Olevel school boy to look at the\npresent figures and calculate the\nnumber of college-capable people\nwe will have on our hands in ten\nyears' time, but when Lord Robbins announces it, it comes \" like\na lightning blast from Mount\nSinai.\"\nScientists should become politicians and leave the politicians to\nhandle debates. Mr. Grimond\nsaid \" I am a politician, I love\npolitics, and I'm quite happy to go\nback this afternoon and make life\nhell for such ministers that I can\nfind there \"\nM. SOMMER\n\n"

    "content": "12 FELIX COUNCIL Watson talks, and folks\nCOUNCIL\nQUOTES\n\" We have a dynamic President\nand Secretary this year.\"\n\"Highly ridiculous.\"\n** As a matter of interest what\nwere ive voting against ?\"\nNICK WALKER WRITES\nThere was no sign of \" apathy \" in the council meeting on Monday, 27th, if the volume of words was anything to judge by. Unfortunately most of what was said was to no purpose whatever. Two\nand a half hours were spent discussing the working party report; in\nthat time the President must have spoken for at least 1| hours. When\nother members were allowed to talk they almost invariably strayed\nfrom the point, yet the President did nothing to restore order.\nOther than the President, five members almost mono polis ed the\nconversation, speaking o yer150 times. Of the rest of the twenty-one present (out of a complete council of twenty-four) three spoke\nmore than five times, nine spoke four times, two once and one member not at all; perhaps he was too bored by the official waffle.\nThis should have been an important meeting yet six members\nleft before it was finished, three did not even arrive. Those R.C.S. members who left to go to a sherry party ought to be ashamed\u2014\nI.C. Union is much more important now than R.C.S. ever will be.\nOf the actual meeting not \u2014\nmuch can be said. The recommendations it eventually passed\nare :\u20141. A deputy President of I.C.U. to be elected, to be in charge\nof Union buildings, etc.\n2. Another full time permanent\nClerk for I.C.U.( when money\nis available).\n3. A Halls of Residence Rep. on\nCouncil.\nA great deal of discussion took\nplace trying to decide on the title\nof the new member of the executive, and whether instead of a Deputy President there should be\na Srcretary for South Side and\none for Beit. This was rejected\nowing to misunderstandings that\nmight arise over external affairs.\nEverybody agreed that the\nUnion needed another Clerk\u2014\nmainly for Felix, Phoenix and\nother similar bodies. I wonder\nhow long it will be before this\nnew clerk appears. If the Union\nis as hard up as it makes out, it\nwill not be able to afford any\nnew employee. The one recommendation passed which could\nwell affect most people in the\nUnion was to have a Halls of\nResidence representative sitting\non Council. Council fully saw\nthe danger of letting the Halls\nbecome too independent, and this\nmove may halt the present trend.\nAlso mentioned were whether\nto reduce the number of General\nUnion members on Council and\nthe process of election of Union\nofficers. \u2022 The election of President was again put forward.\nAfter much pointless discussion\nenlightening no one, everyone,\nwith the notable exception of Mr.\nPrice, was so fed up that these\nmatters were left undecided.\nUnion Council is a waste of\ntir i it; for those who sit on it, for\nMrs. Robb who has to take the\nminutes, and for the Felix reporter who HAS TO report it Parish Paper Yet another competitor for\nFelix! Hot footed, and short\nwinded, behind Goodlad, Babb\nand the Second year /Electrical\nEngineers, comes the United\nChristian Societies' News Letter.\nIt is expected to be out next week,\nprice Id.\nChairman /of the S. C.C. and\nnon-bearded father figure of the\nReligious Societies, Roy Ellis told\nme, that it will contain general\nand religious news.\"\n\" We expect it to circulate\namongst Christians and interested\nparties,\" he said,\nThis is an historic step by the\nI.C. Church Socs., who like their\nmother Church have been disunited for years. The efforts of\nPope Paul are having far reaching\neffects.\nFelix wishes the venture success. CRANE CRASH\nOne man died when the jib section of a tower crane operating on the\nR.C.S. site crashed 60 feet to the ground.\nUNDERSEXED\nThe average I.C. student is\nmost definitely sexually apathetic.\nThis interesting conclusion has\nbeen reached by Your Special\nCorrespondent after nearly three\nyears research. Surveys at both\nOxford and Cambridge have\nshown that about forty per cent of\nthe female and about sixty per\ncent of the male students experience sexual intercourse before\nthey graduate. Various estimates\nat I.C. have put the figures at\nbetween five and fifteen per cent\nfor the women and between ten\nand thirty per cent for the men.\nWhat are the possible reasons\nfor this situation? At Oxford the\nstudent lives in an archaic society\nof rules and regulations, with\nsevere punishments for the sexual\noffenders. In London there are\nfew rules, and there is also far\nmore contact with the non-student\npopulation. Surely one would\nexpect more promiscuity in Ixmdon, yet at I.C. this is not the\ncase. Are Oxford students livelier,\nmore ready to experiment? Or\ndoes the I.C. student come from a different religious, social, and\nmoral stock? Or is it that regulations cause the very situation\nthey are apparently trying to pre-vent? There is probably a grain\nof truth in all these suggestions,\nbut they cannot completely explain the figures quoted.\nWhat conclusion can we arrive\nat? A likely one must be that life\nat. I.C. produces sexually timid\nand apathetic citizens who don't have the time or the ability to mix\noften and easily with the opposite\nsex.\nSCIENTISTS\n&\nENGINEERS\nWe will visit\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nLONDON\non February 134b and we would be happy to meet you\nand tell you about employment opportunities in our Company and arrange\nfor you to visit our laboratories and\nfactories during the Easter vacation.\nPlease ask your University Appointments Board for further details of our\nvisit\nIf you miss us, please drop me a line and I will send you our brochure\nand an application form and arrange\nio meet you at a convenient place.\nS.

    "content": "FELIX THE STATUS OF THE\nENGINEER Nearly half the undergraduates\nat I.C. are engineers ; many of\nthem believe engineering is a worth-while profession\u2014'but what\ndoes the rest of the world think ?\nMore important, what do school\nsixth-former s think ?\nMany engineers will agree that\ntechnology is often overshadowed\nby pure science. We have all\nheard of \" Scientists's efforts to\nreach the moon\"\u2014essentially a technological problem. Engineering lacks status\u2014and this is\nreflected in the quantity and\nquality of undergraduate en-tr ants. Mr. G. Jones, of Birkbeck College, gave a lecture last term on\nhis survey of attitudes of sixth-former s to engineering, unfortunately to Electrical post-grad-u at es only. This lecture was\nbased on an article by him in\n\" Engineering.\" A conference of\nteachers and industrials was held\nin Oxford to discuss this very\nproblem last Spring. Two main\nfacts emerge. In spite of overwhelming pressure for University\nplaces, which meant that 5,000\npeople failed to gain admission\nlast year, many College's engineering faculties were unfilled.\nThen, the sixth-former s who gain\nthe highest A level marks definitely prefer pure science to en-g in ee ring, and the less able prefer engineering.\nTwo reasons seem to cause this\nindifference to engineering in\nsixth-former s \u2014 one educational,\nthe other social.\nSOCIAL STANDING\nAt 17 or thereabouts, sixth-former s, living in a very restricted\nenvironment mentally and soc-i ally, must choose their careers.\nObviously, they will prefer pure\nscience, of which they have some\nexperience, to technology, of\nwhich they have not. The masters who advise them on careers\n(their parents are rarely con-sul ted)) are usually pure scientists\nor arts masters with little knowledge of technology.\nPerhaps just as important is\nthe social standing of engineers.\nHere ignorance is shocking. One\nsixth-former said \" mechanical\nengineering was very much a good job and worthwhile taking\nup in the early part of the century. The scope for knowledge\nof this subject is however so\nlimited that there can be little\nstimulus for discovery and overcoming new problems to-day.\"\nThis is an age when technology\nprogress has never been greater.\nAnother said of Civil engineering,\n\"To my mind, it is an employment for a local or county council. I myself would never work\nfor a council.\"\nMr. W.D. Hutchings of the\nOxford department of Education\ninstigated a survey among ten per\ncent of all sixth-forms, public and\nstate, in England and Wales. A most revealing part of his survey\noccurred when boys listed professions according to\u2014\n(a) which they thought were\nhighest paid,\n(b) which they thought had\ngreatest prestige in the public eye,\n(c) which they thought required\nthe highest intelligence.\nOf the 19 given occupations,\ndoctors, solicitors and nuclear\nphysicists came high in the \" top\nsix\" of each category, architects\nand school and university\nteachers came high in two cate-go ries. Engineers came nowhere.\nMechanical engineers are\nthought by many to be in the\nsame category as factory\nworkers : \" Blokes in boiler suits\ncarrying oil cans.\" One boy said\n\" I think mechanical engineering\n. . . is one of the lower types of\nscientific employment.\"\nSW Mu wc en \u00ab oJ tUD N'T EVEN S fCI LW w>AH t ONE 1\nTECHNOLOGICAL HERO Outside school, these boys are\nbombarded by film and T.V. programmes glorifying doctors,\nlawyers, scientists, policemen . . .\nnever engineers or technologists!\nWhat can be done ? Obviously\nat schools, careers in technology\nshould be much better publicised.\nPerhaps even technological\ncourses, to supplement pure\nscience courses, could be given\nin schools. And the social prestige of engineers increased\u2014-just\none good T.V. series or a great\nnovelist concentrating on a technological hero would go al png way to improve the sad social\nstanding of engineers.\nAnyone who wishes to pursue\nthe story of these two surveys\nfurther will find articles in the\n1st March and 13th September,\n1963, issue of \"Engineering\"\nvery informative.\nPETER CARTWRIGHT.\nFACE TO FACE WITH THE Islamic Week\nOne hears about Islam, about\nMuslim countries, and about\nMuslims. Many people know\nMuslims make a pilgrimage to\nthe holy city of Mecca, and that\nMuslim countries (Middle East,\nNorth Africa, Pakistan, Malaysia,\nIndonesia) are very much in the\nnews. But is this all that you\nknow about Islam? Would you\nlike to know more about Muslims,\nto meet them and to discuss\nvarious topics with them? Then\nyou should join in the Islamic\nWeek.\nThe aim of the Islamic Week is\nto present various facets of Islam\nand Muslims to the members of\nthe College, and others, and in\ncoffee sessions in the evenings to\nmeet each other and form friend-ships. To this end various cul-t ural, religious, social, and historical programmes have been\narranged. On Monday 10th Feb.\n\u2014Social Evening with the Pakistani Society in South Side lounge\nat 7.30 p.m. Mr. Majeed will\nspeak on \" Islam in Pakistan \"\nand there will be films and coffee.\nOn Wednesday, 12th Feb.\u2014Cultural Evening. Talk and films\nabout Islamic Culture at 7.30\np.m. in the S. C.R. Union.\nOn Thursday, 13th February,\nMeeting with the Arab Society.\nTalk on \" Palestine \u2014 Mancroft\nAffair \u2014 Jordan River\" by Edward Attayh at 130 p.m. in the\nConcert Hall. Also, at 7.30 p.m. in the Union S. C.R. there will be\na discussion with the Student\nChristian Movement on \" Honest\nto God: Christianity and Islam.\"\nOn Friday, 14th Feb. \u2014 Friday\nPrayers at 1.30 p.m. in Room 18AR.C.S. At6.30 p.m. the Idd\nReunion Dinner with the Arab\nand Pakistani Societies will take\nplace. All are welcome to these\nfunctions and we hope you will\nbring along your friends.\nALLY ESMAIL\nENGINEERS BOOZE-UP\nIn the setting of a decor designed by that brilliant interior\ndecorator Howard Wise, the\nEngineers held their Annual\nDinner Dance. The guest speaker\nwas Mr. E.S. Sellors, who needs\nno introduction to our Chemical\nEngineers.\nSome outstanding features of\nthe evening were the inaugural\nN. Other (followed by much\npresentation of the new spanner\n(after much labour) and the cabaret by an old Centralian and A. laughter). The ladies were impressive and generally well-dressed and altogether the atmosphere belied the common fable\nthat all 'Engineers are .spanner\nwaving morons, (greeted with\nmuch sce pt is m).M. SOMMER\nPHOENIX CRIT\nPhoenix is often regarded as\nI.C. Union's white elephant. Despite this, the last issue sold\nsurprisingly well. Congratulations\nthen, to the Editor for the way in\nwhich he instilled some life into a magazine which was feared by\nmany to be moribund. He has had\na difficult task on his hands, and\nhis enthusiastic and effective\norganisation has been very evi-dent, especially regarding the publicity arrangements. However,\ndisappointingly little of this vigour\nstems from the pages of the magazine itself. The poetry is not only\n\" pseudo\" and weak, but is\nunreadable, and merits no more\nthan a cursory glance. The\nessays and short stories are better\nwritten but are not outstanding.\nThis leads one to win der if this\nis really the best that IC can pro-duce. Obviously, it is not, and it\nis regrettable that so little support\nif forthcoming for a cause which\ndeserves as much as it can get.\nPerhaps the Editor's almost obvious shortage of copy partly justifies his reliance on contributors\nwho are unconnected (with \"the\nCollege.\nThe Editorial itself says very\nlittle. It was really no more than\nthe airing, in a vague sort of way,\nof the Editor's grouse with the\nRector for censoring his original\nefforts. In the circumstances we\ncertainly sym pathis e with him for\nbeing denied the Freedom of his\n\" Facile pen.\" We are therefore\nleft to infer what is, in fact, the\n\"Fertile Fodder\" to which the\nEditor refers.\nThe layout is less startling than\nit has been in the past, However,\nthe profusion of blank spaces was\nannoying. These, surely, would\nhave been avoided by using\nquotes etc. The use of small type\nwas also irritating, and further,\nwe consider the use of small letters\nin the author's names a most\npeculiar habit, to say the least.\nThe overall impression we\ngained of \" Phoenix \" was that,\nalthough it showed much promise,\nthere was a distinct lack of any\nstrong editorial policy character-ising it. Bill McAuley, the Editor\nis, we know, trying to remedy this,\nand we wish him every success i or the next issue.\nG.S. "

We joined four other English\nStudents, two from Cambridge\nand two from Birmingham, and\ndelegations from Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and\nItaly. The well arranged programme combined visits, recep-t ions, and lectures and provided\nadequate stimulus and scope for\ndiscussion.\nSeveral Industrial^ visits were\narranged for us including the\nNuclear Centre at Saclay and\nthe Basse-Seine Shell Refineries.\nLater in the week we visited Orly\nAirport, the Bridge at Tankerville (complete with gale-force\nwinds )and the \" S. S. France\"\ndocked at Le Havre. We were\npresented to the Lord Mayor of\nParis at a\" Champagne and\nCaviar\" reception in the City\nHall.\nA Dinner-Debate at the end of\nthe week proved interesting,\namusing and not without its confusions due to the added difficulty of expressing one's point of\nview in French!\nPoints discussed included the\nImportance of Vac. Training;\nthe Responsibilities of the Student towards his Studies ; Lectures and Study Methods and\nLiaisons between Industry and\nUniversity. We discovered that\nseveral of the other European\nScientific Universities have compulsory courses in subjects such\nas Philosophy, Classics and Languages. On the other hand, the\nMidday General Studies Programme is unique to I.C. From discussions we learnt\nthat Science and Technology in\nother European Countries is\nmore advanced than one might\nbe tempted to believe.\nWe feel that the useful experience gained could be greatly\nextended if I.C. were hosts to a similar gathering of European\nStudents in London.\nJENNY CHAPMAN.

It was pleasing to be\nable to distinguish between the\ngood parts and the rubbish, of\nwhich there was noticeably little.\nMr. Rogers spoilt a reasonable\narticle by his bitter little comment1 on the union in the year 2000. He\nmust be a non-athletic type. The\nmost ill con cie ved article was Mr.\nBerry's effort. Whilst we all realise\nthat Mr. Berry was the biggest\nnoise in the Bristol Union we also\nrealise that his efforts to become\neven a small noise at IC have been\nconspicuously rejected by his fellow students. Mr. Berry is very\nmuch out of touch with what is\ngoing on in IC union and he has\nonly been to one council meeting\nas an observer, yet he tells us\nwhat to do with our union. He\ndid make one pertinent suggestion\namongst all the impertinent ones,\nnamely the way in which the\nUnion elects its president. It is\nnow three years since the student\nbody decided to allow council to\nelect the president, but three years\nis time enough for the composition of the student body to change\nappreciably, so what about giving\nthe present students a chance to\nshow what they want in the way\nof election of the top union men.\nHalls of Residence\nImperial College is fast becoming a residential college, and\nwhere life once centred around\nthe constituent unions entirely,\nthe halls are now becoming increasingly important in student\naffairs, despite what certain of\nthe old diehards may think. Now\nat last council has been informed\nof this important fact and has\ntaken action and created a Halls\nof Residence representative. It\nwas a wise decision to allow the\nhalls to choose their own method\nof election and for council merely\nto invite them to send a representative. In this way, council has\nassured that a healthy relation\nwill exist between the halls and\nthe union and the students wil i be able to fully enjoy the facilities\navailable in their hall, while still\nretaining control over their social\nand sporting activities.\nFAMILY PLANNING A TI.C.7 In 50 years Brazil has reduced\nher illiteracy rate from 65.3 to\n50.6 per cent\u2014but because of\npopulation growth the number of\nilliterates has actually risen two\nand a half times.
