    "content": "FELIX HEATED DISCUSSION AT UNION MEETING\nAn ordinary I.C. Union meeting\nwas held an Thursday December 5 th. The accounts far the previous financial year were presented and ap-proved; Mr. Garnett managed to ax-plain how \u00a3142 were inadvertently\n\"lost\" at the 1956 Commemoration\nBall.\nMr. Chadwiok informed members\nthat in the future spot checks of\nOnion Cards would be made.\nGUILDS DO THEIR NUTS OVER SPANNER. \"If the Spanner goes up in this\nbracket it will disappear within throe\ndays\".\nThis prophecy by Dave Stevens at\nthe last C. and 8. Union Meeting was\nfulfilled. Mounted on the last\nTuesday of term, It had gone by Thursday evening.\nThere were two attempts to ' lift' It that day, one in the afternoon -when a band of R.C.S. boys and girls\nassembled below the bracket.\nWatched by at least three guilds-men, one of the maidens climbed up the\nwall, but went round the bend on the\nappearance of the Guilds porter.\nLate that evening (at 9.15 PPO\nR.C.S. returned to Guilds and, while\none of the girls led the porter into\nthe basement (.'), took It and bracket.\nThe booty was taken for coffee, whence\nIt reached R.C.S., and was hidden in\nan open locker.\nNext morning It had gone from the\nlocker, leaving the \"Spanner-lifter s\", going around in ever-decreasing\ncircles, finally vanishing in their\nown confusion.\nApart from a rumour that\"some\nnasty little fellow has threatened to\nchop It up and float the pieces down\nthe Thames,\" and a statement from\nChad1\nin the bar \"I know where It is\",\nthere seems to be no clue as to the\nspanner* s whereabouts at the time of\ngoing to press.\nGuilds had a Union Meeting yesterday!\nThe distribution of political\npamphlets by societies and individuals was d is oui sed at length and Mr.\nChillow proposed a motion that Union\nCouncil be instructed to take action\nagainst the person or persons res-pons i ble. Action against societies\noo ul d, as at present, take the form\nof suspension of funds, and against\nindividuals of suspension from the\nUnion.\nMr. Blok introduced the sub j eot of petty thefts and needless damage\nto Union property. Mr. Chadwick commented that, \"We are getting to the\nstage where we need to police the\nbuilding.\" Someone cited an example\nat the R.C.S. Smoking Concert when,\nalthough there were only two free\npints per person, over fifty glasses\nwore broken. \"The drinking of al it tle beer is no licence for hooliganism?\nA motion proposed by Mr. Blok instructing Union Council to take stronger\naction against the vandals was carried.\nMr. Emerson expressed disquiet\nat the present cloakroom system having himself lost a duff le coat on\nthe night of Guilds' Carnival; he\nthought that a small charge might be\ninstituted. In reply, Mr. Stevens\ninformed him that the matter had\nbeen discussed and if necessary the\nregulations would be tightened until\nthey became a matter of habit.\nCommenting on Union lighting\nMr. Chadwick said that all Union\nrooms should be lighted (this, however did not apply to the hostel -\"Par be it from the Union to restrict social activities\").\nThe meeting closed with questions on the Refectory situation.\nPRESIDENT SETS PRECEDENT On January 3rd a select company\nassembled in the Bar to celebrate the\nfirst anniversary of its re-opening in\nthe Union. As on the October Commemoration Day, the Student Orator\nwas Richard Garnett, who delivered the\nopening proclamation with the dignity\nand zest we have come to expect of him.\nFrom his hot seat in front of the\nroaring fire our August President,\nMr. Chadwick himself, announced that,\nas befitted the occasion, he would\nstand a drink for all those present.\nVfhen the gathering had regained its composure he expressed the hope that\nfuture Presidents would see fit to\nfollow suit - this was received with\nacclamation and the fetching out of\ndiaries. A toast was drunk to The\nBar, and to Ted Smith, who has served\nbehind it so faithfully, and whose\nlast year with us this is. Later in the evening, by courtesy\nof the Union, hot sausages with rolls\nand mustard were served to the Assembly Some diversion was caused by a tremendous conflagration. All the\nlogs having been consumed, a certain\nMr. Oggi picked up the carton in\nwhich they had reposed and thrust it upon the flames. Not quite, however.\nA portion jutting out of the fireplace\ncaught alight, and smoke rose billowing\nto the ceiling. Ted Smith, however,\nrose equally to the occasion. Sounding the Alarm on the Cricket Club Bell,\nhe snatched up a soda syphon and poured\nin a broadside. The inferno, thus\nthreatened, cowered and then 3u b3ided. The soot remains on the ceiling - a moment of heat i3 recorded for ever.\nTOUCHSTONE SIN. CRIME 8. MORALS\nDr. Bailey took the Wolfenden\nReport as a point from which he plunged\nhis audience into Sin, Crime and Morals.\nAfter reviewing the history of the Wolfenden Committee and Report Dr. Bailey\nexplained why it was decided to deal\nwith homosexuals and prostitution tog-ether, there being no visible link on\nthe surface. However they 3hould not\nbe isolated from antisocial behaviour.\nThe effect of the part of the\nReport relating to Criminal Law is to\ndeclare a kind of no-man's land in sex\nbehaviour where actions can be sinful\nand immoral but not criminal. On this\nbasis prostitution is not a crime.\nThe criminal element arises in solicitation and the problem of street order.\nThe Committee felt the need of action\nby driving the prostitute off the\nroads, and therefore treating it as a female problem and not as the male problem it is. Men are at both ends, as\nexploiters and clients. If prostitutes\nare driven underground rackets would\nstart endangering the women. A prostitute is not a depraved and a licentious woman but an inadequate person\nwho drifts through without finding a niche for herself and who cannot be re-formed.\nDr. Bailey carefully differentiated\nbetween homosexual condition and homosexual behaviour. A homosexual is a mentally and psychologically handicapped\nperson and a3 such i3 a problem for\nsociety. It is wrong to assume th.it\na heterosexual fornicates, likewise it is wrong to assume that a homosexual\nnecessarily practises. The Law3 on\nhomosexuality need drastic revision;\nin their present form, they are un-just, and discriminating to handicapped\npersons.\nIt is significant that each of the\nthree discussion groups considered that\nsex e duct ioni3a psychological, as well\nas a biological problem. A more comprehensive sexual education before and\nduring adolescence would in time prove\na useful weapon in the battle against\nprostitution and homosexuality. The\nbalanced and non-sensational elucidation of the problems of sexual behaviour\nin society enlightened the minds of\neveryone who attended this Weekend.\nThere was a handsome majority\nof R.C.S. man and wanes present,\nGuilds had 5, Mines 3, and the Royal\nCollege of Art 2 representatives.\nWhether because of the interesting\ndiscussion, or the lack of billiard\nplayers, one discussion groan lasted\nuntil 2 sum. - an all time Touchstone\nrecord.\n\n"

Here we have the postwar \"shot-in-the-arm\" of English\ntheatre exonerating himself from any\naccusation of shallowness that might\nfollow such whimsical pieces as\n\"The Phoenix Too Frequent\" or \"The\nLady's not for Burning*, both previously seen at the College.\nA tirade, based on the eldest\nand most impressive \"birth of a nation\" story of Moses in Egypt\nand clothed in the effervescent\nCwse of Fry, calls for virtuous!ty\nin the oas t \u2014 and, most important,\nin their voices. The advent of a \"type-oas t\" handful of senior members and a very promising group of\nfresher s apparently launched the\nventure, and the production seen at\nthe end of last term should have left\npast members of the Society satisfied\nwith decision to go on where others\nhad feared to tread.\nDirection was in the hands of\nColin Dixon for the first time - his\nexperience of stage matters showed\no lear i,i' in well-conceived sets\nmaJ C js full use of the new theatre's height and facilities. Especially\nstriking was an opening scene on\nthe palace balcony where the much-vaunted cy clo rama lent the final\ntouch to an Egyptian summer. His\nstage crew backed him well with\nstructures of plausible solidarity\nand excellent colour - but the timing of 3con a changes needed reducing to more professional limits.\nMore rehearsal seemed a remedy and\nIt is in this that I found the weak\nlink of the play.\nSpence and Allen were formidable\nand obvious corner-stones of the cast\n- Hoses, the sincere and idea ll st ii c orator got all the oratory needed\nfrom' the now-familiar, rich Allen\nvoice. Joining him in author at ive use of voice and movement, Mike\nSpence's 'Ramases' gave conviction\nto the whole Royal household. The\nnewcomer, Sheila Burbidge, next\nclaimed attention - a very successful sketch of the young Pharaoh's daughter and one that bodes well for\nthe future strength of the company.\nPeter Morgan played Shendi - one of\nthe moat difficult parts in a diff i cult play - as perhaps no-one else\ncould have done. Iris Dickinson\njoined the ranks of the \"known\"\nactresses and grappled in an assured\nmanner with the discrepancy in years\nbetween herself and her part.\nAngela Lance had a similar problem\nand I warmly applaud this fresher\nfor her attempt.\nIf I have left Desmond Turner\nto the last it is to make a general\npoint rather than a particular\ncriticism. As with other activities\nin the College, the experienced \"old\nhand\" is becoming rarer and here was\na case of enthusiasm and potentiality\nlargely lost by gross short-comings\nIn technique. The vo ioe was strong -at times - but confidence will not\nclear a throat. And, oh those\ngestures An hour's firm\ncorrection would have doubled the\nvalue of his performance - this year\nwe see an unusually talented \"crop\"\nof new arrivals, it is to be hoped\nTWICE A KNIGHT\nSOCIAL PREVIEW Socially speaking, last term was\none of the best for some time- \u2014 the\nsuccess seems likely to continue. As\nfar as major functions are concerned,\nThe Ball is set rolling by the Engineers on January 31st. The dance will be preceded by dinner in the Upper\nDining Hall, where the tables will be\narranged as for Hall Dinner, and in the Upper Refectory, where there will be separate tables for parties.\nOn February 14th( St Talentlne's Day) the Miners present a Carnivalperhaps the Queen ef Hearts will\nbring some of her tarts along for\nbreakfast.\nOne month later, on march 14th, the B.C.3. gives birth to another\nCarnival.

    "content": "FELIX5 EXPLORATION\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR QfUffCH SOCIETY\nPMlLIAfieti/T Dear sir, To should like to draw the attention of your readers to the Mock\nParliaments to he held in Ayrton Hall\non Thursday evenings at 7-00 pm.\nConservative Government\nLabour Government\nLiberal Government\nCommunist Government\nJan. 23rd Jan. 30th Feb. 27th March, 6th Deer Sir,\nWhilst agreeing generally with\nXenophon's views on Exploration, I should like to make the following\ncomments.\nAlthough it is desirable that\nexpeditions be of the most general\nkind, so that members with the widest\nrange of interest may participate,\nno attempt will be made by the New\nExploration Society to discourage\nexpeditions which are largely\nspecialist in nature, since these may\ngo to a region quite unsuited to a general expedition. In addition\nit is the specialist typo of expedition which yields the greatest amount\nof scientific information.\nThe impression of the Exploration\nBoard which is given is also mis-leading, for despite their \"bureau-crat ic trammelling s\", they have succeeded in giving the leaders of past\nCollege Expeditions admirable support.\nTours sincerely,\nPeter Smith\nDear Sir,\nThe viewpoint of one \"Xenophon\"\non Exploration contained an inaccurate\nstatement with regard to the financing\nof the 1958 Ghana Expedition. Al though the Exploration Board has given\niac/\\ey to the extent of one third of the\noriginal estimated cost, the remainder\nhas to be made up of individual contributions t* om the student members and\ndonations i rom industrial and commercial\norganisations?\nIi'i jct he arg i&f JbX future expeditions should be fa research\nnature. By definition, expeditions\ninvolve investigation of unknown\n\"territory\" - whether it be geological,\ngeographical, meteorological, geo-physical, biological or any other\" -io al\" is immaterial. Exploration\nis therefore either synonymous with\nresearch, or at least an integral part\nof it. To suggest the divorce ment of the two is meaningless.\nIn a badly punctuated and obscurely\nworded sentence he inferred that special is t expeditions were undesirable, and\nalso that their members jealously opposed other groups planning expeditions.\nThis firstly shows his ignorance of\nthe problems en vo i ved. Sponsors do\nnot give money out of charity. They\nask and deserve reasonable results.\nAs shown above, there is a wide range\nof top ios to explore. With such limited numbers, only a few can be dealt\nwith adequately if the reasonable results are to be obtained. Hence\nspecial is ation is inevitable, if only\nfrom the financial angle. As to his\nsecond point about opposition from\nso-called \"vested interest, I know of\nnone and would be interested to learn\nprecisely what he means.\nHe next took upon himself to\na peak for the proposed Exploration\nSociety, a Society which dUn\u00bb*t even\nexist when he wrote the article.\nFurther, the Initiators of the Society\ndisowned the article when it appeared.\nI.C.? Dear Sir,\nWhen is a society an I.C. Society?\nAs I understand it, not until their\nprovisional constitution has been road\nand passed by two successive S. C.C. or\nA.C.C. meetings. On this pretext . ire-fore the Church Society is not entitled\nto call itself an I.C. Society, as\ntheir constitution has so far only been\nread once.\nThey should thus bo severely\nreprimanded for wrongly describing\nthemselves in the General Studies pro-gram me. Yours faithfully,\nJ.K. Taylor.\nI cor rat u late the writer of the\narticle on getting a few points correct,\nespecially the aims of the Exploration\nSociety - perhaps it was because these\nlatter were up on a notice board in the\nUnion &r the time.\nFinally he complained of the \"mere\nbureaucratic trammelling s of the\n(Exploration) Board\". This is my second year of dealing with the Board and\nI have yet to experience these trammelling s\". On the contrary, where an expedition has been jeo pardi sed by delays,\nthey have mercilessly by-passed any red\ntape to give all possible aid.\nI believe FELIX aims at producing\ncontroversial articles to promote\ndiscussion among readers. It is however, the duty of the writers to\no heck their facts and thus avoid in accurate Or half true statements.\nThese can only mislead readers who\nare not in a position to o heck the\nfacts for themselves.\nTours sincerely,\nRobert F. Sturrock.\nEditor's note:\nTo quote the first paragraph of\nthe \"Viewpoint\" to which Mr. Sturrock\nrefers: \"Several highly successful\nexpeditions have been run by students\nfrom this college during the last few\nyears. But what of future plan a? To judge from the Exploration Board's in-tray only a follow-up expedition of\na research nature, which might well\nhave been backed from other sources,\nis forthcoming.\" No mention at all was made of the financial outlay involved. Mr. Sturrock refers to bad\npunctuation and obscure wording. We\nhave printed his letter in its original\nEnglish, apart from correcting the more\nelementary mistakes, of which nine were\nspelling errors and ten grammatical.\nWe wish he would confine himself to the\nsubject under discussion.\nIn each case the speaker of the House\nwill be provided by the Literary and\nDebating Society.\nWe would like as many as possible\nmembers of the Union to attend, either\nas Independent M.P.s when they will\nhn ve an opportunity to speak, or as\nobservers.\nYours faithfully,\nLaurie Pretty Conservative Society\nFrank Thilo Socialist Society\nDavid Thompson Liberal Society\nDavid Leigh Marxist Sub-group\nPUT UP JOB\nSir,\nIn the Prince's Gardens' column\nof your issue dated December 6th, you\nrefer to \"put-you-up type\" beds as\nbeing wholly unsuitable for your\nhostel project. Your advisers suggest\nthat, in other hostels, such beds \"were\nvirtually worn out\" after four years of\ncontact with the student body.\nWe are relieved that you write of\n\"put-you-up type beds\" since, as manufacturers of the original PUT-U UP\nsettee-bed, we have many imitators.\nAnd although we are a little long in\nthe tooth to remember pre ois ely the\nstrains which student furniture must\nbear, we are confident that a genuine\nPDT-U UP would stand the test of many\nmore years than four.

Already many of our\nscientists and engineers emigrate to\nthe United States and Canada whore\nsei ent if ie development is fostered by\nevery conceivable means. If a concession to Victorian sentimentalism\nat the e ost of aq quarter of a million pounds is thought to bo realist-ic, It is hardly likely to encourage\nfewer to do so.\nPHOENIX GETS\nTHE BIRD\nFollowing so soon after the report prepared by its sub-editors, the\nlatest PHOENIX came as a great disappointment. Rudimentary principles\nwhich should have been taken for granted seem to have been completely dispensed with. First, THE PHOENIX is\nthe magazine of Imperial College and\nas sue h should reflect the activities\nand interests of the College, Second,\nit should provide scope for original\nthought. Third, articles should be\nclear and concise (as oie nti fie principle), interesting and readable.\nAt on* extreme wo have Maurice\nSavidov's incomparable \"Light Metallurgy\". This is a beautiful example\nof what I mean by reflecting the activities of the College (The Guinness\nadvertisement alone attained success\nIn this direction). The idea was original and expounded with simplicity.\nAt the other extreme stands, or\nrather falls, the profile of Albert\nCamus. There is no connection between M. Camus and Imperial College.\nThis article, something under a page\nin length, contained no fewer than\nfive quotations, five pickings from\nother people's brains. Readable? At\nlsa st it was short.\nUnfortunately IC.Camus's profile\nIs by no means alone in its extremity.\nThere is no need for me to give a catalogue hare.\nSo review of this PHOENIX could\npossibly no gl set \"Clotty\". Sething to\nla with I.C.t anything but concise,\nit nevertheless contained a spark of\noriginality \u2014 the use of words for\npurposes other than that for which\nthey wore originally intended is\nsomething achieved only accidentally\nby most people. PJt.l. We were very sorry to hear of the\ndeath of John Perkins a second year\nChemioal- Engineer. Be was a regular!\nmember of the 1st XT and his loss will\nbe keenly felt.\nAny member of the College who\nthinks for a moment about the offerings of Touchstone and General Studies,\nwill realize that a not inconsiderable\namount of money is involved in keeping\nup the high standard of speakers\ninvited.\nThis money is in the main\nprovided by the Governing Body and is believed to total about \u00a32,000 per\nannum. About half of this is spent\non the general studies lectures, and\nthe remainder on grants for various\nactivities around the college. We\nthus have the position that less than\n\u00a31 is spent for each member of the\nstudent body throughout the whole year,\nbut far worse than this is the fact\nthat non-scientific culture is thought\nto be less than the worth of one\nprofessor, and any look at the Calendar will show how many of these high\ngentlemen are apparently floating\naround.\nSATURDAY NIGHT Last Saturday's hop was the first\none to be held under the Entertainments Committee's improvement plan.\nIt was unfortunate that many of the\nwomen's training colleges had not yet\nrestarted, as a result of which there\nwere about 50 more men than women\nf resent. All the single men's100) and double Tickets (75) were\nsold, but only 50 of the 100 women's tickets. About 50 men were turned1 away; some of the more venturesome\nstood by the door and introduced\nthemselves to the first girl who o a me along, returning In triumph to buy a double ticket.\nThere was no inspection of Union\ncards, and men who o a me along wearing\nL.S.E and King's scarves were not\nrefused tickets while they lasted.\nThis seems unfortunate since many I.C. men were among those turned away\nlater.\nThere was room to dance in oom-fort in the Concert Ball, for a change, but there were few people\nupstairs, where the Jass Band was\nplaying. With a full complement of\nwomen things might have been quite\ndifferent. Certainly one cannot Judge\nthe E.C.' s plan on this one hop i the\npopularity of their innovations remains to be seen.\nHALOS FOR ROVER CREW\nEight members of I.C. Rover Crew\nsaw in the New Tear in rigorous fashion\nin the Borrowdale region of the Lake\nDistrict. Four of them camped at\nSprinkling Tarn (2,000 ft.) on the\nnights of January 1st and 2nd. It\nwaa very cold in camp - a tent, damp\nwhen pitched, froze solid and two pairs\nof boots were frozen overnight and H \u00abd to be thawed out over a Primus. On\nNew Tear's Day, the party climbed Jo\nthe top of Soafell Pike, from whl o>> they saw the spectre of the Brooke*,\na kind of misty mirage effect that\nbestows a halo on one's shadow.\nIs this an equitable expenditure,\nor should our facilities for broader\neducation be expanded? The question\nof shortage of money may be raised,\nbut surely this cannot be a valid\nargument in view of the insignificant\namount already spent as compared with\nthe general expenditure on teaching\nstaff as a whole: would it not be of\nmuch greater benefit to all concerned\nif some of the relatively useless\nmembers of the present Academic Staff\nwere disposed of and the money diverted\nto the furtherance of the Arts and the\nHumanities? I fear that this is\nanother case of a dictatorial civil service deciding that a scientific\ninstitution shall teach nothing else\nbut science. It is just as necessary\nfor us to have a good nan-technical\nlibrary as it is for the wide provision\nof scientific books and journals.\nThe union library, good though it is, is half-strangled through lack of\nfinance.\nThe Record Library supplies\na much needed service to the whole\ncollege, and indeed seems very well-patronised, but once again finance is\nits stumbling block. Purchases of\nnew discs can only be made infrequently\nand the smallness Of its grant precludes\nthe widening of its catalogue much beyond\nthe popular repertoire. What support do\nthe Art Club and the Photographic Society\nget for their furthering of the Arts?\nNone,so far as I know. One could work\nthrough any cultural activities of the\nCollege and the Union, all along the line\none finds this same paucity of support.\nWhat can be done? The answer is\nsimple, make available more money which\nsurely cannot be 30 difficult for our\nwell-financed Governing Body. Any\nsuggestions that these Touchstone grants\nmay be cut must be strangled at birth,\nar.d every possible means adopted for\nthe Governor'3 equitable support must\nbe furthered.\nJ.K. Taylor\nWALLET THIEF\nGETS FIVE YEARS\nAt the December Sessions of the\nOld Bailey, a man was sentenced to\n5 years imprisonment for the theft of\na wallet from the gymnasium changing\nroom in the Union. He had previously\nbeen convicted, in 1947, for stealing\nfrom the same place, and altogether\n30 oases were taken into consideration.\nThe thief gave himself away by\nusing a driving licence taken from a wallet belonging to an R.C.S. man as\nan identification when passing worthless cheque a. He was arrested by the\nPolice and questioned, but would at\nfirst only admit to passing the\ncheques. Eventually, however, ho did\nconfess to the thefts. None of the\nstolen property waa recovered.\nSOBER\nDear Shir,\nWs wash net sh loa ho a. fourth,\nQuildah Cabaret.\nMi tor's mote: Sherry.\n\n"

Speculation an the fate of the Coleutt tower, or owning glory of the a hort ly to-be-lamented Imperial Ioatltute, has recently teen revived as a remit of the publication of the estimated cost of keeping it. It will be recalled that two years ago the proposal to completely demolish the\nInstitute aroused much antagonism among the natives of Kensington, whereupon the\nGovernment decided that the tower should he left standing. The College was requested\nto plan the development of the site accordingly and to investigate the oost of the\nretention, both ef wh i oh have been done. The estimated price of this compromise will\nhe \u00a3250,000, to which must ef course he added the detrimental effect on the development scheme as originally put forward. One is reminded of the o a pti on to a cartoon\nIn the EVENIHG STAHDAHD of March 15,1956: \"If they'd get as worked up about the Empire as they do about its monuments, we might still have an Empire to get worked up\n\u2022bout.\"\nON OTHER PAGES\nBar Anniversary .2\nCouncil Meeting 3\nLetters 5\nSin, Crime and morals , .2\nSport 8\n\"The Firstborn\" Reviewed 6\nThe Spanner 2\nUnion lite ting2 Viewpoint *\nWhile the Government has stated that it wishes the tower to be kept, it has not\n\u2022aid whether *he money required will he forthcoming. It is not altogether Inconceivable that another compromise he suggested.\nNot un surprisingly then, the\nposition with regard to the island\nsite is somewhat unsettled.However,\nconsiderable progress has been made\nin the last two years with the plans\nfor the site, and latterly with the\nbuildings for the new Physios and\nEngineering blocks,,\nThe building for the Physios\ndepartment is under way and is on\ntime, so far. There appears to be\nnothing at the moment that could\naTf eot the completion dates, although\nthere are still some points under\ndiscussion between the Department\nand the Architects. The block facing\n(Jueen1\ns Gate should be finished by\nthe start of the Spring Term in 1959,\nand the block facing Prinoe Consort\nRoad by the beginning of the session\n1959-60.\nThere has been some delay in the\nprogress of the new Engineering block,\nas the design of the steel work is\nbeing modified following upon comments by the University Grants Committee. However the original completion date, i.e. the start of the\nSession 1959-60, is still envisaged.\nRUGBY CLUB INVINCIBLE IN FRANCE On the evening of Boring Day, 2if good men and true met in the Queen's before delivering a challenge to the\nformidable rugby playing talent of\nthe Bordeaux region of France. The\nchannel crossing was uneventful except\nthat Otto Gilbert studied his limiting\nTicket carefully for some minutes\nbefore realising that it was not a telegram, as he had originally sup-posed. The first evening was spent\nin Paris where the party joined in\nthe gay and varied night-life with\nuninhibited enthusiasm and considerable\nversatility (details censored).\nAfter the long coach journey to\nSaintes, during w hio hit was hoped the\nafter-effects of Paris would wear off,\nproceedings began with the first of\ntwo vigorous training sessions.\nIn a12 a side trial the \"Drunks*\n(without Hoaksma) beat the \"Sobers*\n(plus Hoaksma) 13-12. Reassured\nthat they could still play rug ger, the\nparty went on to Sariat, a town in the\nwooded hills of the Dordogne, where\nenthusiasm for rugby runs very high.\nGreeted by large banners bearing the\nword \"WBL'COME\", I.e. were plunged\ninto a New Tear's Ball, where those\nselected to play on the following day\nrevealed commendable restraint.\nAt this function, and on many\nother occasions, I.e. made brave\nefforts to converse with the French\nin their own language, and made many\nfriends. The Entente Cordiale has\nnever been stronger. Barry Lans\nastonished his men by his fluency at\nFrench, although some others seemed\nmiraculously to acquire similar\npowers after a few vite Dubonnets.\nHowever the vocabulary of D. Phillips\nappeared to extend little beyond\n\"oui\", \"oom bien\", and *ou est la toilette?\", while Milward was in\nfrequent trouble.

It lasted from 6 p.m. until 11,\nwith a break for dinner. Most ef the\ntime was taken up by the presentation\nand'dl s cus sion of the reports ef representatives on committees \u2014 there\nwere thirteen of these.\nOn the subject of Exploration,\nCouncil felt that there was insufficient scope for student disc is sion and\nplanning. The Board was sot able to\nmake suggestions, and disclaimed all responsibility, although a leaflet\nwas being produced for the benefit of\nstudents and firms. However, the advice and contacts of individual members of the Board were valuable and\nthe j \u2022 -loosed Society ought to co-op-e rate fully with them. Feeling was\nthat the Secretary of the Board was\nthe best person to handle the urgently needed n \u00bbVi1 publicity.\nPresenting the -report of the Entertainments Committee, its chairman,\nKr Streets, said that they felt that\nthe term's hops had left something to\nbe desired. They had been overcrowded\nand low In tone, and the women's colleges were complaining. Accordingly\nthe number admitted would be reduced\nfrom 460 to about SSO, of which 150\nwould be en double tickets, and an\neffort made to keep out non-I.C. men.\nCouncil were not unanimous in their\napproval. Bid the opinion of Council\nre pre seat that of the Union at large;\nObviousxy many people liked the hops\nas they were. Replying, Mr Streets\n\u2022aid that his committee had no dogmatic ideas and, while they were resolved te Improve matters, would experiment to find the best ways of\ndoing so.\nMr Hodgson, oha lr man of the Sooi al Clubs Committee, reported that\nfour mew societies had received preliminary approval) they were the\nBilliards, Exploration, Chinese and\nChurch of England. This brought up\nthe question of the organ!s at i, of\n8.C.C. The general opinion seemed to\nbe that S.

    "content": "8 FELIX SHORTS NEUS\nCOUNTRY University Champions Again\nThe flag flew again above the Union\nwhen the Club won the University Championships on See. 7th., for the second\nyear in succession. The expected\nclose struggle with L.S.E. did not\nmaterialise due to the unfortunate\nillness of some L.S.E. men, and\nI. C.C.C.C. walked away with the Cup,\nunchallenged. No praise is too high\nfor the magnificent performances of\nthe I.C. first team. John Evans was\nthe Individual winner for the third\nyear in succession, and the whole\nteam had the incredibly low score of\nM points. Their positions were:\nJ.S. Evans 1st., J.E. Collins 3rd., J. Conway 6th.,R. Landbeck 10th., A. Brown 16 th.\nThe second team also did well to\nfinish sixth, being beaten only by the\nfive major College first teams.\nThe annual Club handicap race was\nheld on V/ ed. ll th. Dec. and, for the\nfirst time in many years, the handicaps were determined on a fair basis\ngiving all an equal chance of winning.\nThis caused a very close finish, and\nM. Clare is to be congratulated on his\nvictory.\nIn the vacation a team of eight\ntravelled to Dover, in one car and\na reluctant vehicle which absorbed all its passengers' energy in getting it there, so that the team were defeated\nby Dover A.C. in the match that follow-ed.\nThe first match this term was on the\nhome course against Lloyds Bank and\nPearl Insurance. The latter defeated\nour second *ea a, whilst the result\nagainst Lloyds was declared void due\nto several runners going off course,\nSAILING I.C. Sailing Club narrowly beat\nHampton Sailing Club at the Welsh\nHarp on Sunday, Bee. 12th., after two\nof the closest races seen for a long\ntime.\nIn the first race I.C. had the first two boats home - the whole fleet of\nsix finishing within 50 yards. The\nsecond race looked like giving Hampton\na runaway win, until on the last leg\nof the course Graham Taylor, by\nclever tactics, reversed the race pos-it ions, giving I.C.a win by one\npoint.\nI.C.37& pts.

Farrow.\nc n1M tH\nR fR With the Club started on the second\nhalf of the season, it is an opportune\nmoment to look back and review the Club's progress during the Autumn Term. Very\nfew matches were lost and there was an\nabundance of goals.All four teams were\nwell placed in the Intercollegiate\nleague. Indeed, it was easy to visualise at least a hat-trick of divisional championships by the end of the\nseason. However, it is unwise to count\none's chickens, etc. and last term's excellent record must be maintained\nbefore the championships become\nreality.\nThe Club spirit has never been higher,\nand there is little difficulty in fielding 10 teams per week. The fifth XI,\nnewly created this season, have performed very creditably, fully justifying\nthe Hon. Seo's. efforts in arranging\nmany fixtures at short notice.\nThe 1st XI ended last term with\nmatches against Heidelberg University\nand Finchley 'A'. The German side\nbrought Continental football to Harlington, the first for a long time. The\nGermans, with the wind and rain behind\nthem, played fast, attractive football\ngiving the I.0. defence much to contend\nwith, Heidelberg took an early lead\nwhen the wind our led an apparently\nharmless centre into the I.C. net.\nAfter this rather fortunate goal,\nHeidelberg asserted their superiority\nand soo red two more excellent goals,\nboth from \u00a30 yards range. In the second\nhalf, the conditions favoured I.C. and\nit was the Germans' turn to come under\nconstant pressure. I.C.'s many efforts\nat goal were foiled by a pecked defence\nI.C. did score what appeared to be two\nperfectly good goals, but the referee\nwas not impressed. Tne final score of\n3-0 to.Heidelberg was I.C.'s biggest\ndefeat of the season. After the match\nand the lunch the German side was taken\nto Wembley to see the Varsity match and\nthereafter back to I.C. for dinner and\nbeer. Heidelberg were most impressed\nand expressed their desire to return\nthis hospitality in the future.\nThe final game of the term against\nFinchley was played in the impressive\nsurroundings of Finchley Stadium, and,\nI.C. felt indeed honoured. The College\nprovided football worthy of the ooo as ion in the first half and three good goals\nwere scored to the opponents' one.\nDuring the second half, which was goal-less, the game deteriorated somewhat,\nand I.C, appeared content with a31 win.\nThe Spring Term began with a22 draw\nagainst Q.M. C. and so another league\npoint has been lost. Perhaps I.C.'s performance can be put down to the\nChristmas break from regular football\nas in the next match, against the powerful St. Mary's College side, I.C. played\nmuch better football and finished winners by 2-0. The first goal o ams from\nan in or edible move involving only Jeff\nMoss, Dave Young and Keith Codling who\nput the finishing touch to the movement.\nThe Ist XI have a very strong programme ahead, but the present combination should be equal to the task.\nThe Fourth XI, who have attracted\nattention by their 100% record of last\nterm, have since added another resounding victory to their tally.\nRecord to date:-P. W.D.L. F.A.1st XI 18 11 3 4 58 33\n2nd XI 15 11 1 3 58 40\n3rd XI 17 14 1 2 63 23\n4th XI 16 16 0 0 81 20\n5th XI 15 9 0 6 62 55\nOSS HOCKEY The 1st. XI have continued their\nmost successful season by beating\nboth Royal Naval College, Greenwich,\nand Guy's Hospital. The Greenwich\nmatch was played in exceptionally\nmuddy conditions and a score of 4\ngoals to 1 (King 1, Miller 1, Bhatnagar 2)was an apt reward. Guy's were\nalso beaten decisively by 4 goals to\n1, the scorers being Holmes (1),\nLee (2), and Hlller(l). In a recent U.l. Cup match, I.C. drew 2 - 2 with U.C., after being 2 -1 up only twenty seconds before the\nfinal whistle. In the subsequent\nextra time Macrae saved a penalty bully\nThe 2nd. and 3rd. teams are maintaining a high standard of hookey and\nare, on ooo as ions, able to win their\nmatches.

Telephone Piece. London. W. I4\nIC WSC NETBALL\nIt was with great trepidation that .\nI. C.W. A. approached their first Netball\nmatch of the season. Not only were they\nnine months out of practice, but their\ncaptain was down with 'flu, and Chelsea\nPolytechnic had a reputation for\nexcellence. When, therefore, they\nsuddenly discovered that they were playing quite a good game they were very\nencouraged.\nAlthough relying mors on accurate\nshooting than on organised teamwork,\nthey kept level with Chelsea throughout\nthe first half, first one then the other\nteam drawing ahead, but never with\nmore than on* goal load. In the second.\nhalf, however, Chelsea adopted some\nof I.C.'s own tr loka and I.C. W.S.C. wore not able to improve their speed\nor accuracy of throwing, so that the\nfinal score was 13 - 9 to Chelse\nObviously a little more practice as\na team could bring I.C. some Botball\nvio tories.

Dai Phillips, a tower of strength to the backs in all three games, kicked a magnificent\npenalty goal, loudly acclaimed by the\n1,200 crowd, and Sarlat equalise d with\na much easier kick just before half-time.\nThe I.C. forwards, with Gibbons,\nCrosier and Gilbert much to the fore,\nobtained a large share of the ball.\nAn injury to Brougham forced a reorganisation of the backs, but they\nthrew the ball about well and Gibson\nhad some good runs down the left wing.\nSeveral times I.C.o a me very near to\nscoring a try, but the Sarlat defence\nwas keen, so a draw was a fair result.\nAfter the match Sarlat threw a magnificent banquet. They had made\nno secret of the fact that their intention was to eat and drink I.C. under\nthe table. Sarlat is described in some guide-books as \"renowned for its gastronomy\", and when I.C. were called\nupon to drink soup-plates full of red\nwine in one swig, it looked as though\nextremely hardy constitutions would\nbe required to withstand the onslaught.\nAt the end many I.C. men looked groggy\nand some suffered fearful repercussions\nlater. One was even found snatching\nforty winks in a side-street. However\nseven or eight were left upstanding and\nwilling to o on tin ue when the last remnants of Sarlat had clearly had enough.\nThis gas trono mio al triumph was also\nnotable for the first of three diplomatic speeches in French by Lanz during\nthe exchange of presentations, and some\nentertaining singing by persons of both\nnationalities.\nI.C.C, SAIBTSS 9\nSaintes were not described on the\nadvertisements as \"ren for oe\" for\nnothing, as they included seven borrowed players, including 4 from Cognac,\na first-class club. The local paper\nhad proclaimed I.C. as among *1'elite\nda lab alle ovale\". It was gratifying\nto find that the rugby correspondent of\n\"La Republique\" appeared to think this\ntitle well justified, as, heading his\ndescription of the match \"L 'IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE A FAIT UNE BELLE EXHIBITION DE\nJEU ODVERT\", he praised I.C. for keeping the game open despite \"l 'etat du\nterrain qui rend a it la ball eg lisa an to et le jeu a la main par fo is diff i cile* FELIX After an even first half Saintes\nled by a try to nil. However, the\nI.C. forwards, playing uphill, then\nstaged a magnificent rally, thanks in\nno small measure to the sterling front\nrow of Martin, Gibbons and Topping.\nAfter a complicated series of events,\nGibson scored in the left corner, and\nshortly afterwards Lain pounced on a defensive mistake by Saintes to put\nI.C. ahead. Phillips just missed\nwith a dropped goal and was once pulled\ndown a yard short of the line. The\nSaintes team, now jabbering heatedly\namong themselves, had one chance to\nequalise with a fairly simple penalty,\nbut the ball sailed wide and we had\nwon!\nI.C.3, ROTAN S Despite pouring rain about 2,000\nwatched \"le grand match international\",\nand in very slimy o on ditions the Royan\nbacks gave occasional glimpses of high-class handling and running which might\nhave spelt disaster in dry conditions.\nAs it was, the pitch 3O0n became a morass, with both set3 of forwards\ncovered with mud (so much so that at\none stage two Frenchmen had a fight\ntogether for some seconds before realising they were playing for the same\nteam). The I.C. forwards and halfbacks all played with great vigour and\na sensible appreciation of the con-ditions, and one forward dribble in the\nsecond half provided the equal ising try, scored by Hoeksma (to the delight\nof all Ex A members present). Royan\nhad scored a fine dropped-goal in the\nfirst half.\nSo ended a memorable tour, highly\nsuccessful on and off the field. On\nthe field our players rose to the occ a sion. Particular praise is due to\nDai Phillips, Ray Gibbons, Barry Lanz\nand George Martin who played in all three games and were always in the\nthick of the fray.\nOff the field many and diverse\nwere our activities, and they will be\ndiscussed for many years in the Bar.\nBut the vital factor was that, whether\nwe were swilling Dubonnet or merely\nsipping black coffee, whether we were\nresting inertly on our beds or rushing\nmadly about in dodge ms, whether scrambling up hills in the Dordogne or inadvertently alerting the fire-brigade\nin Paris, fun and good humour abounded,\nand it was the grand team spirit which\nset the seal on a great tour and made\nit unforgettable.\nTHE RUGBY CLUB HAD..\nm so vs mm Recent marriages:-Roger Sykes (ex-Editor of Phoenix).\nWho are rich people?\nPoor people with money.\nThe Press Secretary of the U.S.A. E.C. was reported on the B.B.C. as\nhaving said \"You can't take a sci-ent is t's baby away from him without his getting disheartened.\"\nSurely this applies to all of us.\nProf. Jones talking on practical\njoking remarked that the C in-C Eastern Mediterranean said to the\n\u2022 C in-C Gibraltar (who was already\na K.B.E.) after the latter had been\nmade a K.C.B. \"What, twice a Knight,\nat your time of life?\"\nDuring some filming by M.G.M. in\nPrince's Gardens Nelson overheard\nthe following \"0, here come some\nactresses\" only to find they were\nICWArians. We don't know what\nwe're missing, do we?\nMr. A. V.S.( Tony) de Reuck, seven\nyears on I.C. council, now a 'sub-editor of Nature, has been appointed a governor of an L.C.C. school\nby the London University Convocation. Our congratulations go to\nhim in this his latest appointment.\nA cro s3 country runner remarked that\n\"You run behind a taxi and look at\nthe fares you save\". Presumably\nthis accounts for their recent\nsuccesses.\nOnce again Oggi hits the headlines,\nhe now sports a growth of beard.\nWHILE I.C. WATCHED The annual concert of carols and\nChristmas music wa3 given shortly before\nChristmas by the Musical Society's Choir,\naccompanied by the Jacques Orchestra,\nunder their conductor -)r.3 ric Brown,\nIt was very satisfying to note the\nmarked improvement in their rendition\nover the past year, which is in no small\nmeasure due to Dr. Brown's leadership\nand his understanding of student idi o3y ncr a cie s. Along with the traditional carols, in their usual gui3 e, was the\noriginal setting of \"While shepherds\nwatched ...\" which came as a pleasant\nrelief from the rather hackneyed version usually sung, and an arrangement\nof a. Americal carol.\nThey also performed Parry's \"Blest pair of sirens\", previously\nheard in the Albert Hall on Commemoration Day; the improvement in this\nwork was such that one wondered if it were the same choir that was being\nheard.\nIn conclusion, it is to be hoped\nthat their improvement will continue,\nand that a performance worthy of their\ncapabilities will be given of Bach'sB Minor Mass later this term. It is unfortunate that the Musical Society\nis so dependent on the financial support\nof the Union and the College Authorities that it cannot have an Orchestra\nwhose size is in keeping with the work\nperformed, rather than the small string\norchestra and piano with which they\nhave to make do.\n.A SUCCESSFUL TOUR\n\n"
