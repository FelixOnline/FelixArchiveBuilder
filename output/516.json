    "content": "Dear Mr Harris - In the light of\ncertain remarks that have\nappeared in FELIX I feel some\ncomments must be made, some of\nwhich should have been brought\nto the attention of students long\nago.\nPersonally, when I read Stella\nEarnshaws letter I did not really\ncare that you had closed\ncorrespondence on it. I would\nhave liked to say something about\nthe backstreet abortion lie but\notherwise the letter consisted ol\ntwisting remarks I made to\ndifferent meanings and personal\nattacks on me and Sean. None of\nthe pro- abortionists had actually\nanswered any of my points and if\nthis is the best they can do it shows\nthey have no concrete arguments\nanyway.\nI would be interested to see you\nactually name the vast number of\nalleged people who could not\nstand another mention of abortion in FELIX who came to\nyou and asked you to stop it.\nWhilst I accept that after six\nletters on the topic it could have\nbecome stale to many people I do\nnot see how you can justify saying\nthe 'same few' who were\ndiscussing it as I was the only\ncorrespondent who wrote more\nthan one letter on it (ie 2). Each\nweek someone different made a contribution (and Iam sure you\ntold me 2 women had replied to\nMiss Pratts letter but then you\ndenied it when the next FELIX came out).\nYou are also unjustified by\ncomparing the issue with the\nstand on homosexuality based on\na belief that only a tiny minority\nof students have. I have no\nparticular religious or political\nbeliefs, and assess the issue as I assess torture or blackmail,\nwithout reference to any dogma.\nMy arguments would apply to\nanyone, not just those who believe\nthe Bible or Das Kapital or\nwhatever.\nI submitted a letter last week\nwhich you refused to print on the\ngrounds that you had closed\ncorrespondence on the topic. The letter consisted of a number of\nhumorous extracts from the Bible\nabout God. How you can say you\nhad closed such correspondence I fail to understand because -(i) The topic was the Bibles\nattitude to homosexuality.\n(ii) You had closed correspondence on this topic (ie abortion)\nnot 'these' topics.\nI was very annoyed about this\nbecause I had spent many hours\ncompiling them, and I thought\nmany non-religious people would\nfind them amusing.\nWhich brings me to the\nimportant part of this letter.\nPaid sabbaticals, and any other\nunion officers for that matter,\nshould be servants of the union,\nnot masters. You said in your\neditorial ( FELIX512) there is no\ndanger of the union taking over\n'the newspaper of IC Union', there will still be 'editorial\nfreedom' (the editor will still\ndictate how the paper is run?). In\nthe last FELIX, you say you were\n'elected to edit'. I believe these\nconcepts are correct for an editor\nof a commercial newspaper with a large full-time staff, but for a paper like FELIX the editor's job should be co-ordinating and\nmaking the biggest contribution\nto the work involved in producing\nthe paper. Disputes about what\ncan be included in the paper\nshould be settled by a democratic\nbody such as the new FELIX committee, although aUG M should always be able to overrule\nsuch decisions if necessary. The Union finances it, reads it,\nmembers of the union produce it,\nand if it is the newspaper of IC Union the union should have\nultimate control over it. It should\nNOT be controlled by any one\nperson.\nTrue, what you have said is\nwhat the bye-laws say, but I have\nthought the bye-laws were wrong\nfor a long time. I feel aUG M should always be able to overrule\na decision ofthe Editor of FELIX the same way as it can overrule a decision of the President or the\nExecutive. Being able merely to\ndo the ultimate and sack him is\nnot sufficient. I welcome any\nother views on this matter.\nI have never tried to do\nanything about this because I was\nnaive enough to think such\ndisagreements never arose, but\nfrom last week's letter it appears\nthey can and do. I, personally, feel\nyou have been reasonably fair on\nmatters where you may have\nsome bias eg. you have printed\nheavy criticisms of yourself, you\nprinted in full my very long first\nletter on abortion (as I hope you\nwill this letter). Nevertheless,\ndictatorship is always wrong,\neven if it is responsible dictatorship.\nFinally, whilst I can see some\nsympathy for your need to close\ncorrespondence on abortion, in\nview of your refusal to print the\nabove mentioned letter and other\nreports ofthe dictatorial way you\nhave been running FELIX recently I am resigning from my\npost of t fic FELIX committee as\nmedia rep as a small mark of\nprotest.\nBarry Austin\nDear Sir, - Your editorial self-defence in last week's FELIX seemed to me to be mis-judged\nand ill-researched, not to mention\nunfair.\nFirstly, the correspondence on\nabortion was not between the\n'some few' at all. You published\nsix letters on the subject from five\ndifferent contributors; these\nfigures speak for themselves.\nSecondly, if you felt compelled\nto close correspondence, Miss\nEarnshaws letter was not the one\nsuitable in view of its factual\nerrors, unanswered questions,\nserious misrepresentation of the\naims of PATA and its attacks on\nBarry Austin and myself. A brief\nperusal of the contents ofthe letter\nis sufficient to reveal this fact.\nLastly, pla se refrain in future\nfrom needlessly linking abortion\nand homosexuality. The letter to\nwhich you replied dealt only with\nthe former.\nYours,\nSean D Kelly\nPS - I will discuss the contents of\nthe aforementioned letter with\nMiss Earnshaw or anybody else. I would hate to start a chain of\ncorrespondence on editorial freedom and judgement which\nwould, no doubt, be just as\nunimportant and boring as the\none in question.\nDear Sir, - Last week we\nattended, along with thousands of\nothers, the Festival of Mind, Body\nand Spirit at Olympia. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, but\nwere appalled by the large\nwastage. Many stalls handed out\nleaflets to most passers by, even if\nthey showed no apparent interest\nin the subject.\nThe case that shocked us the\nmost being Friends of the Earth,\nwho at the same time were selling\nrecycled paper etc and advising us\nto slow down on our consumption\nof the world's resources.\nTaking the educational aspect\ninto account, we feel that the\ndistribution of a certain number of\nleaflets was needed, but that the\nstalls concerned could have been\nmore s lect ive and given the\nleaflets only to people who were\ndoing more than just glancing at\nthe stall as they wandered past.\nJan and Kirsten Smith\nWHAT' SON FRIDAY 4th MAY DISCO\nIC CHINESE Society farewell party - film, buffet and disco.

He told Union Secretary Mike Elk in that he did\nnot (eel his academic standing was\ngood enough to hold this post.\nMr Jenkins was elected by a mass turnout of Miners at the last\nUnion meeting of the spring term.\nA fresh election will take place at\nthe annual general meeting on\n22nd May. Most of next year's main Union posts are now filled. The same-Union meeting elected John Passmore as External Affairs\nOfficer, Rachel Snee as Rag Chairman and Mick Berry as\nU GM Chairman. The meeting ratified the\nelection of Dave Haddon as\nWelfare Officer and Chris Webb as University of London Union Representative, both of whose\nnominations were opposed.\nAn election in Life Sciences\nresulted in Katy Tatchell becoming next year's Departmental Representative. The post\nof Management Sciences Dep.\nRep. remains unfilled.\nThe new President of Mines\nUnion is Chris Sleap and its\nAcademic Affairs Officer is Pete\nBamford, both of whom sit on\nICU Council. The Community Action Group Chairman is John Whitehouse.\nSeveral elections are scheduled\nto take place at Tuesdays Union meeting. The six members of the\nPermanent Working Party sit on\nCouncil. FELIX Business Manager, Union Publicity Officer and members of the\nExternal Affairs Committee,\nHouse Committee and Union Finance Committee will also be\nelected. Papers for these posts are\nin the Union Lower Lounge until\n5.00pm today.\nPHONE FIENDS Telephone vandals have been\nat work again in the Union Building. An attempt was made\nto remove money from one of the\nnew telephones using a crowbar.\n\u2022Deputy President Malcolm Brain has asked the Post Office to\nprovide a more vandal-proof coin\nbox.\nAP ARRIVES7,800 copies of the Alternative\nProspectus have now arrived from\nthe printers. Its 64 pages contain\nJots of useful information about\neducation in general, courses at\nIC and life in College and\nLondon.\nIts editor Roger Stotesbury can\nfeel proud of this publication. Its\ncontent is presented in an\nentertaining and very readable\nmanner.\nMany students, especially\nmembers of the Academic Affairs\nCommittee, have contributed\narticles and ideas. The Prospectus\nis sent to schools and aims to give\nschool students a 'consumers\nview' of the College.\nSMOKE FILLS CHEMISTRY Smoke instead of fresh air was\npumped through ventilators in\nthe old chemistry block when lire\nbroke out in the ventilation plant\nroom adjoining the building.\nThe fire, which occurred\nshortly after 2.00pm last Friday,\ncaused about \u00a3400 of damage to\nelectrical equipment and cables,\nwhen it spread from cardboard\nboxes containing air filters stored\nin the room.\nA member of staff who spotted\nthe fire called the lire brigade who\nquickly extinguished the (lames.\nThe building was not evacuated.\nNEW FIRST FOR WOMEN For the first time in history a woman is Head of anIC Department, the Rector told an\naudience this week.\nShe is Professor Dorothy\nWedderburn who became the\nfirst Head of the new Department\nof Social and Economic Studies\nlast October.\nOn Tuesday she gave her\ninaugural lecture under the title\n'Great expectations? - engineering and society'. The Rector\nchaired the meeting.\nIn her lecture she outlined the\nrole of the new department. The\nemphasis in undergraduate teaching was on interdisciplinary\nstudies as the department has no\nundergraduates of its own.\nResearch by the department's academic staff and postgraduates\nwas concerned with the structure\nand processes of decision making\nin industrial organisations. They\nwould also be looking at the\nimpact of health and safety\nprogrammes in industry, and\nstudying the Post Office's industrial democracy ex peri ment. She hoped the department\ncould make a useful contribution\nto the \"understanding of the\ninterplay between engineering\nand society.\nShe continued with an analysis\nof the British crisis outlining the\nvarious explanations put forward.\nAll these boiled down to two main\nproblems, she said. These are the\nlack of technological innovation\nand bad industrial relations. She\nwent on to discuss the causes.\nLIVE RECORD SHOW IC Radio made a novel attempt\nto enter the Guinness Book of\nRecords - and transmitted it live\non Sunday night.\nHarvey Nad in was broadcasting the stations regular live\nprogramme from Stans Bar when\nhe came up with a new idea in\naudience participation. How many people could get into a Waitrose trolley over a5m ride?\nThirteen students managed to\npile in but the problem came\nwhen they tried to move forward.\nWith four people holding the\ntrolley steady they crawled 2m whereupon they collapsed in a heap. On a second attempt they\nfound that the trolley was bent\nresulting in Harvey broadcasting\nan appeal for another trolley.\nThere is no current record for\nthis feat. The nearest thing to it is\na record for the number of people\nwho can stand on a pillar box, set\nup by students (who else?) of the\nCity of London College. It stands\nat 29.\nUNIVERSITY\nUNCHALLENGED Imperial College students will\nnot be appearing on University\nChallenge, the popular television\nquiz, this term as the current\nseries has been cut back. The\nteam will take part some time\nnext year.\nThe four students making up\nICUs team are Andrew Gray\n(Biochem PG), Nick Griffin\n(Chem Eng2), Damian Hassan\n(Maths 1), and Frank James\n( HOST PG). Bob Hart, who was\noriginally in the team, has been\ndropped because he will not be a student next year.\nIC RADIO TAKEOVER? Many of the senior members of\nIC Radio will be helping to\nproduce BBC Radio London's Marathon programme, due to be\nbroadcast from 6am on Sunday\nuntil 6.30am on Tuesday. The\nprogramme is an attempt on the\nBritish record for the longest radio\nprogramme and is also intended\nto raise money for children's charities. Radio London broadcasts on 206 metres medium\nwave, 94.9 MHz VHF. I CR a do station manager, John Allen, told\nFELIX that he thought it 'a great\nopportunity for members to get directly-involved in the activities of a professional radio station' and he\nhoped that it would lead to\nfurther co-operation between the\ntwo stations.\nPARKING PERMIT SIC Union will be running\nanother parking permit competition in June for students\nwho want to bring their cars to\nCollege in July.\nIn the past any student could\npark in College grounds during\nthe three summer months without\na permit. This has resulted in\ncongestion especially in July when there are several conferences in College. The new\nscheme will attempt to limit the\nnumber of student cars in that\nmonth. No permits will be\nrequired for August and September.\nStudents who already have\npermits will be able to keep them\nin July. The Union will reallocate\npermits held by students leaving\nat the end of term. Union Secretary Mike Elkin will write to\npermit holders informing them of\nthe arrangements. Students requiring permits are asked not to\napply to the Union until Mike Elkin starts the scheme later this\nterm.\nNEW IC RADIO COMMITTEE Monday's IC Radio AGM elected Harvey Nad in, Station\nManager; Roger Edwards, Technical Manager; Dave Fuller,\nNews Editor; Andy Cannon, Secretary; Alan Burton, Treasurer; Promotions Officer,\nAnthony Ferguson; Record Librarian, Gary Howard; with\nAssistant Station Managers: Jon Firth, Simon Milner, Jamie Bell,\nChris Dalton and Karen Hardy.\nThe new Station Manager,\nHarvey Nad in, made a speech\nsaying that he was pleased to see\nthe co-operation between the\nmedia at IC. He thanked John Allen for all his work as this year's Station Manager and said that IC\nRadio was one of the best student\nradio stations.\nco nld. from front page\n21 year old Boris Kalendarev has been trying to emigrate from the\nSoviet Union since 1973 and- was adopted by IC Union and other\nstudent organisations last year as part of a national campaign to\nsupport the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel.\nIn 1977 he was expelled from College for applying to emigrate and\nsince then the Soviet authorities have tried to force him into the army.\nHe now faces a probable charge of evading conscription which could\nlead to a sentence of three years in a labour camp.\nThe Foreign Secretarys belief that Western protests are effective in\npersuading the Soviet Government to act has received reinforcement\nwith the release last week of 13 year old Misr ha Voikhanski who has\nbeen trying to join his mother in England for the past four years.\nBoris Kalendarevs fate now depends on how much pressure is exerted\non his behalf. Mary Attenborough urges IC students to write a protest\nletter to the Soviet State Procurator and suggests the following text.\n7 am writing to ask you why Boris Kalendarev, a student m your country, has\nbeen charged with evasion of conscription when he applied for an ex il visa in 1973,\nthree years before he became eligible for military service.\n7 urge you most strongly to release him as the action of the Soviet authorities in\narresting him is in flagrant defiance of the Helsinki Agreement and breaches every\nacceptable standard of human rights'.\nThe letter should be addressed to Mr R Rudenko, Procurator\nGeneral, Puskinskava UI.15a, Moscow, USSR.

New Horizon\n(NH) is a day centre for young people drifting in the West End. They\noffer advice and a specialist refer al service to these young people and\nfor their more regular visitors they have a workshop where they offer\nsome practical experience. They also offer some assistance in literacy\nand numeracy. The meeting was chaired by Lord Longford and\nattended by about 60 council members, workers and volunteers. After\nrushing through the preliminaries with great speed we arrived at items 6\nand 7 on the agenda, the 'presentation of the annual report' and the 'Co-or dina tors report'. Both of these were presented by the Co-or d in at or John Rodgers, and what followed was a very graphic talk on the\nproblems and attempted solutions to the problem of drifting youth in\nLondon.\nNo one can deny that there is a problem with youth homelessness in\nthe West End. Its per sistance can be seen in the fact that last year was\nthe tenth since the establishment of NH. The numbers involved fell to a minimum in 1975/6, possibly as a response to the television program,\n'Johnny go Home\", July 1975, but have since crept back up, reaching a new peak in 1978. The drug abuse problem still exists although its\npattern has changed from predominantly narcotic and intravenous to\nthe oral mixing of p harm ace uti cles, illicit drugs and alcohol.\nThe majority of these youths still come from the North, Scotland and\nIreland, driven by unemployment to try their luck in London, but as the\nrecession begins to hit the traditionally more prosperous SE the\nnumbers from this area begin to increase, reaching 21% of the total in\n1978.\nThere have also been considerable changes in the housing scene in\nrecent years, mainly due to the governments ill-conceived legislation.\nThere has been increased provision > for short term accommodation,\nmainly government reception centres but this has been more than offset\nby the fall in private sector accommodation, exacerbated by the\nincreasing costs, tourism and the use ofthe 'holiday Let'. The 'Housing\nHomeless Persons Act (1977)' made no provision for young single\npeople except in the special cases of pregnant women and the\nhandicapped. At the same time, the 'Criminal Law Amendment' made\nsquatting, previously an important source of housing to NH's clients, far\nless attractive. The prospect of fines of up to \u00a31000 or 6 months in jail for\ndisplacing a residential occ u pier serve to put most, but not everyone,\noff. Most local authorities won't place single people on their housing\nlists until they have passed a certain age, Barking - 25 years, Newham45 and Reading, not until they have reached retirement. All in all,\nhomeless young people with ho secure job face little prospect of\nsettling down in society. The near impossibility of progressing into the\nprivate sector has 'bottle-necked' the short-stay and emergency\naccommodation provisions. The newly-arrived youth therefore has nowhere to go and quite often ends up sleeping rough.\nTHE PARENTS OF THE IC DAY NURSERY\nARE ORGANISING A Jumble Sale, Stamp Sale\nand Home Made Sale on\n18th May.\nPlease can you collect jumble\nand give it to:\nAngela Bag u enaR m81,Old Bl d g. Chem. SueT hornet t Day Nursery Janice Yeadon... Lyon Playfair( Level4) Sandra Dawson Rm.431,53 Princes Gate CONTRIBUTIONS of Home Made crafts, jams,\ncakes etc. will be very gratefully received. Please\ndeliver to the people named above before 18th May.\nFor someone in this situation, with no permanent base, it is very\ndifficult to remain presentable, sleeping in one's only set of clothes does\nnot endear one to a prospective employer, and in fact NH provides a store where people can leave a few posses ions. There are also facilities\nwhere they can have a wash and a shave to make themselves more\npresentable. Some may even use the video equipment to practise their\ninterview technique. For the more regular visitors they offer training in\nliteracy and numeracy as well as workshop facilities. Here people can\ngain experience in working with wood or making pottery and the\nexperience of creating something, like a chair, which they will be able to\nsee in use around the centre, can give them a much needed sense of\nachievement. Another problem of being unemployed for so long is that\none begins to lose confidence in ones ability to hold a job when\nobtained, something that also worries prospective employers. This can\nquite often be overcome by placing people on a TOPs scheme, sticking\nthe months out is an achievement in itself and the skills acquired are\nuseful. NHs aim can b.e summed up quite simply in the desire to give\ntheir visitors a sense of purpose in their lives and to stop them from\ndrifting into the more permanent homelessness sub-culture that is also\npresent in London.\nIn the future NH faces many financial difficulties and the prospect of a reduction in staff. The means of financing, in that most of their money\ncomes from statutory grants which are usually made on a year by year\nbasis makes long-term predictions uncertain. The most important goal\nis for an improvement in housing provisions as once people have\nsomewhere permanent to live many of the attendant problems\ndisappear and progress can then be made on those that remain.\nUnfortunately, until we see some dramatic upturn in the economy, or\neven less likely, a radical change in peoples ideas on unemployment\nand poverty, I can't see any significant improvements taking place.\nJust to close, if anyone is interested in finding out more about these\nproblems or the history of NH, I have a few copies of the Annual Report\nwhich you can look at. Also, NH can use volunteers on Sunday\nafternoons just to be friendly with the visitors, maybe help them with a little art work. The number of the centre is (01) 242 0010.\nThank-you.

He had\nbeen staying at a hotel in the town of Bahia\nBlanca. One morning he left to visit some\nbusiness clients. He got into his car in the car\npark and started the engine, and was just\nabout to drive away when a cloud appeared to\nenvelop him, shielding him and obscuring his\nvision of everything.\nHis next recollection was the image of a deserted country road and then he found\nhimself standing alone on the road. He was\nfrightened and confused but he succeeded in\nflagging down a passing lorry and asked to be\ndriven to Bahia Blanca. The driver replied that\nit was a600 mile journey. Instead he arranged\nto be driven to the nearest police station\nwhere a quizzical station officer decided to\ncheck the story and phoned the Bahia Blanca\npolice. They rang back confirming that not\nonly had an officer found the man's car still in\nthe parking lot with the engine ticking over\nbut a crowd of curious onlookers were\ndebating what had happened to the\ndisappearing driver.\nPilot dies to save village\nAn American pilot was ki led after\nstruggling to prevent his blazing Phantom jet\nplane from hitting the village school of\nLealholm in North Yorkshire, where 55\nchildren were having lessons.

The patient's head was covered by a towel and\nthen rocked gently up and down, and from\nside to side stopping abruptly. Dr Barot\ngripped the tooth with the forceps and pulled\nit out. This was repeated with two other teeth -the patient apparently felt no pain. He said\nthat he felt fine, and that \"it didn't hurt a bit. It\nwas as if my jaw wasn't there.\"\nSunday 29th Shirley Williams and the school unions\nThe second biggest teaching union took\nsteps to serve a High Court injunction against\nMrs Shirley Williams, Education Secretary.\nThe Government is accused of having forced\nlocal authorities into breaking the law by\ninterfering with teacher pay ne got at ions and\npreventing them going to arbitration.\nMob stops Euro Times\n500 extremists prevented publication of the\nproposed new European edition of the Times\nwhen they be sei ged the Frankfurt works\nwhere it was to be printed.

The predictions have\nbeen further complicated by the teacher's dispute which could give the Conservative s a last minute bonus.\nWhichever party wins the election Ladbrokes, the bookmakers, are sure to make a large profit on the record number of bets on\nthis election.

David\nRosen then took over and ran the fastest second leg of the course in 42\nminutes 46 seconds putting London in the lead. He was followed by\nRichard Gardner who ran the third leg in 41 minutes 35seconds putting\nLondon well ahead.\nThe forest of Burnham Beeches was the venue for the event which was\norganised by the University of London Orienteering Club. The London\nWomens team, consisting of Frances Lumb (Royal Holloway), Sonia\nHochfelder (IC), and Helen Pyle (QEC), did well to finish fifth in the\nwomens relay although this is a drop from last years second place.\nThe London University men won more prizes last Sunday when they\ncame third at the British Relay Championships (which includes non-university teams) at Swynnerton Old Park in Staffordhsire.\nSteve Kirk was the second to finish on the first leg, finishing the 6.8km course in a fast 38 minutes 11 seconds. David Rosen running second\nhad a good run but dropped two places to fourth. Richard Gardnertook\nover to bring the team up to third place.\nThe team was frustrated to learn that the race had been won by\nOxford University whom they had beaten a month previously. A team\nfrom Bristol came second.\nSteve Kirk is to be Captain of IC Orienteering Club next year. His\nnomination which was unopposed was accepted at the clubs Annual\nGeneral Meeting last Friday. Steve is a very experienced oriente er who\ncame to IC last October as a physics postgraduate after studying at and\nrunning for Reading University. Ken Warren will be the Clubs treasurer\nand Nigel Ward is to be publicity officer.\nOrienteering continues throughout this term, despite exams, with a full programme of Sunday events and several Wednesday afternoon\nevents. Particularly recommended is the event at Burnham Beeches on\nMay 13th. The forest is very fast and pleasant orienteering terrain and\nclose to London. Further details can be found on the club noticeboard in\nthe Union building entrance lobby or at the clubs Friday lunchtime\nmeetings. Beginners are always welcome and the Wednesday\nafternoon events are especially suitable for anyone wishing to take up\norienteering for the first time. Sonia Hochfelder\nIC Vths 11-1 Kings IVths\nOn the final Wednesday of last term IC Vths played what\nshould have been their last league game of the season. This\nproduced a truly emphatic eleven goal rout of an obviously\noutclassed Kings IV team\nThe match was also significant in that it marked the final\nappearance of one of IC's finest footballers; a skilful ball-playing and 'fair' tackling defender who has often ed been\ncompared to Franz Beckenbauer, Iam, of course, referring to\nPeter Twigg.\nIt was only fitting that in his final game Peter Twig g should score\nprobably the best goal ofthe game when he ghosted past two defenders,\nand sent an unstoppable shot into the top corner ofthe net out ofthe\nkeepers reach (Twigg 2-0). This followed a fine goal by Mo Misra, to\nopen the scoring, when he latched onto a through ball by Steve Kaye round the keeper and cool y slotted the ball home. With John Healy\nadding a third goal when the keeper dropped the ball, Kings were\nlooking fairly disorganised and though they did pull back a goal just\nbefore half-time, their only chance of avoiding defeat seemed to be the\nweather which was rapidly deteriorating. Their prayers seemed to be\nanswered when with three minutes of the half remaining the players\nwere called off due to a heavy hailstorm.\nUnfortunately for Kings not as possible,\nonly was the game restarted after\na twenty minute delay but by\nthen they only had seven men\n(four others having already\nshowered and changed). The\nfifths facing only seven men soon\ntook control of the game and the\nKings goal mouth was under\nconstant siege for the whole ofthe\nsecond half. This resulted in a further seven goals for IC,\namongst these was a fine penalty\nby Cyril Knowles, his first goal for\nIC, and Al Cable mis kicking the\nball between the goalkeepers legs\nfor his goal, after a brilliant run by\nDam ion Kelly. In the final\nminutes it was pleasing to see that\none member of the fourths.Steve\nVeats, came across to cheer the\nfifths on, the others obviously\nprefer ing to get to the bar as soon\nBefore the final whistle was\nblown there was time for both Mo Misra and John Healy to\ncomplete their hattrick s for\nDennis Cook to score two and\nsomeone whose name escapes me\nto miss a penalty.\nTeam: Russ Gilbert, Steve have, Cyril\nKnowles, Giles Brerelon, Pete Twigg,\nDamion Kelly, Al Cable, Dennis Cook,\nMo Misra, Lewis Roberts, John\nHealy.\nPS. This was to have been the last\nfifths game but due to weather\ninterference only sixteen games\nwere played by the fifths and they\nwill be relegated unless they play\nanother two games, and lor this\nreason a double banker has been\narranged against Charing Cross\nHospital on Wedensday May9 th. REVIEWS I instrumental side, boasting an excellent\ndrummer, an imaginative use of keyboards,\nand the woodwind skill of John Anthony\nHelliwell on assorted saxes, whistles, and\nother oral devices.\nAll these qualities are present on 'Breakfast\nin America', although perhaps in a sub t ely different form than previously. In the past,\npeople may have been scared away from the\nband by the apparent magnitude of their\ncompositions. As far as I know, they have not\nyet written a rock opera, but there are plenty\nof 6/7 - minute tracks knocking around. On the new album the songs have become more\ncondensed, giving a tighter blend of vocals\nand instrumentals that brings down the\nlength of the songs whilst keeping the\nproduct typically Supertramp. 'The Logical\nSong' is a good example of this, as is\n'Goodbye Stranger'.\nIn general terms, this album has a great\ndeal to recommend it - it is a progression for\nthe band and a rewarding earful for the punter\n- catchy tunes, interesting arrangements and\nan overall gloss of good production make it\nimpressive the first time round, and it stands\nthe test of time very well; my copy is only six\nweeks old and wearing out fast, but the music\ndoes not bore me yet. Supertramp will be\ntouring Britain later in the Summer, and I fancy that this album will attract a new\naudience on top of the diehards. It certainly\ndeserves it.\nSimon Milner\n\"Go and Review a bad concert\", they said, \"It\nwill be good practice tor you.\" So one\nSaturday evening six thousand fans\nconverged on the Wembley airship hanger\nand one sce pti c went along for the ride not\nexpecting much in return for his \u00a33.50.\nNine million people had bought one of his\nrecords, so what better example could you\nfind of an overrated boring old hippy\npreaching to the converted. Surely this would\ngive full scope to the nasty reviewer.\nIt started off at the entrance, \"come and\nbuy the programme of the tour of the album\nas com meme rated on the badge, T shirt or\nposter'. Anyone would think they were after\nyour money. But no, a free gift is distributed\nto the hoards; your very own Mike Oldfield\neuropean tour commemorative dart. Greatthe highlight of the night perhaps?\nEventually everyone was sitting comfortably so they began; a22 piece rock\nand string orchestra with an 11 piece choir,\nhardly a small affair. Then a man in a white\nsuit came on and started to play a guitar. The\npeople at the front applauded so I suppose it\nwas the man himself but unfortunately I'd forgotten my binoculars.\nHis friends then joined in and they started\nplaying Incantations, the sound was perfect,\nthe production exquisite, the musicianship\nflawless. The music was not bad either. In fact\nit was nice, very nice. So nice that one\nmember of the audience fell asleep. Twenty\nminutes later slumber was in t erupted by a lady singing. Maddy Prior was singing the\npoem Hiawatha; her voice was crystal clear\nand worse still the music had suddenly\nchanged and become enjoyable and interesting. Incantations then ended and\nbeing considerate souls the musicians left so\nwe could go and spend our money. A few\npeople queued for the priv i ledge the rest\nplayed with their paper planes.\nMike and his mates returned, played three\nnotes and the crowd went wild. Yes this was it\n'Tubular Bells', the ultimate in mankind's many achievements; the one and only rock\nsymphony, at least according to my\nneighbour. Almost everyone clapped, stamped, bopped, or jigged along with the\nbeat. One member even managed the odd\ntwitch and didn't fall asleep at all. The shapes\non stage began to move and even looked like\nhumans.\nI suppose I 'll have to be honest, it was\nenjoyable, even the new b latent ly trendy\ndisco single and the silly traditional sailors'\nhornpipe.\nThe high standard of musicianship and\nsense of occasion was just too much and they\ndeserved all the praise they got. Maybe next\nweek will I find that illusive bad concert when\nPublic Image appear in secret gig fiasco\nreport.\nP.S. "

    "content": "MEET IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nPoor Turnout by Local Residents\nJez on show at the Meet IC Day\nOWEN SYMPATHY FOR SOVIET JEWS Foreign Secretary David Owen has expressed support for the\nwork of individuals and private organisations who campaign\non behalf of human rights for Soviet Jews.\nIn a letter to Mary Attenborough Dr Owens Political Adviser says\nthat' the Government have considered carefully whether to intervene with the Soviet\nGovernment on behalf of Boris Kalendarev, the Soviet Jewish student\nadopted by IC Union and recently arrested by Soviet police.\nHe goes on to say that'/Ac Government have concluded that they can best help\nby doing all they can to bring about a more enlightened and humane attitude on the\npart of the Soviet authorities to human rights in general rather than by making\nrepresentations on behalf of individuals\n\u2022 'Private organisations and others, of course, do extremely valuable work in\ndrawing attention to individual cases; and I am convinced thai evidence of\nwidespread public concern does have an effect on the Soviet authorities ...\"\n'The predicament of Mr Kalendarev is only likely to reinforce public concern\nabout the Soviet Government's implementation of the Act, and will reinforce the\nGovernment's determination to do everything they can to bring pressure on the\nSoviet Government to improve its performance in these areas'the right of peoples\nto cultural and religious freedom and freedom of movement , the letter\nconcludes.\nco nld. on back page\nAbout 130 local residents saw Imperial College in action on\nWednesday this week when they were invited to 'Meet Imperial College'.\nNo effort had been spared to impress the visitors and in the event the\norganisers were rewarded by success.\nThe aim of this public relations exercise was to enhance goodwill\namong College's nearest neighbours for IC by showing them something\nof what the College was doing. Residents from all walks of life received\ninvitations including members of the Knightsbridge Residents\nAssociation, some of whom had been vocal in their opposition to the\nproposed Linstead Hall extension.\nThe chief organiser Captain Lindley had miscalculated somewhat on\nthe numbers. He had expected around 300 people and numbers were\ndisappointingly low. But those who came thought the effort was well\nworth while.\nThe visitors arrived at 4.30 and were first of all treated to tea and\nbiscuits in the Sherfield lower refectory to the accompaniment of music\nprovided by members of IC's orchestra.\nAt 5.00 precisely they all filed into the Great Hall where they listened\nto The Rector telling them about the College, its history and activities.\nVisitors were duly impressed with the scope of ICs facilities both\nacademic and recreational, and the Rector ranged over the various\nresearch subjects of the department and the activities of student\nsocieties.\nAfter listening to the Rector the\nvisitors had an hour to look at the\ndisplays set up in the J CR and the\nheavy electrical and hydraulics\nlaboratories. Professor Laithwaite\nwas on hand to demonstrate his\nlinear motor which proved a source of amazement to all.\nMost departments had set up\ndisplays of their work in the J CR. A number of student societies\nalso participated including Photographic Society, Audio Soc,\nSTOIC, Radio Society, Art Club\nand the Red Cross detachment.\nOutside, Jez, specially polished\nfor the occasion, was popular\namong the few children present.\nAt 6.30 the visitors moved into\nthe Senior Common Room for\nwine and snacks. Mooney truly\nexcelled himself giving parti ci pants a totally false impress sion of IC catering.\nEvery detail had been worked\nout. Even a drawing pins subcommittee had been set up to\nsolve the problem of obtaining\nlarge numbers of drawing pins all\nof the same colour. In the event\nthey failed as I observed both\nwhite and gold drawing pins\nsecuring the displays.\nThe Union also participated,\nboth in the guise of its societies\nand as a provider of 20 guides to\nhelp visitors find their way\naround. These were equipped\nwith specially designed slop shirts\nwith the rather unimaginative\nmotif 'meet Imperial College'. A lengthy argument had taken\nplace over whether the guides\nshould be allowed to keep the\nshirts, but following indications\nthat the College was unlikely to\nget them back anyway, the\norganisers finally decided to let\nthe students keep them. But on the whole 'Meet IC, the\nfirst event of its kind in College\nwas a success and the visitors,\nwho ranged from the Director of\nStudies of the French Institute to\nan Irish Civil Servant who had\nonly come for the wine, left with\na good impression of the College:\n\n"

You are about to experience an article\nwritten in the novel (and enormously\nexpensive) process of shake-er-round. To\nachieve this unique and stimulating effect\nmerely rock violently from side to side whilst\njumping up and down, at the same time\nclutching your half open FELIX in one hand,\nwhilst also Which leads me to\nBATTLESTAR GALACTICA (U, Glen A. Larson)\nA successful science fiction/ fantasy/adventure movie (delete those you\nthink inapplicable) shook the Film industry in\n1977. Immediately the cogs engaged on a production line geared to exploit. First off the\nline is a mammoth television series called\n'Battlestar Galactica'. A3 hour pilot show has\nbeen cut to 118 mins (what's missing?) and\nadapted for the cinema, incorporating\nsen surround( a rip off I swear!) I would\napprove wholeheartedly if the plot were new\nand innovative but\nAnother galaxy, another time. Sounds\nfamiliar. The 12 planets of humanity have\ndecided to end 1000 years of war with the evil\nCylons and walk directly into the inevitable\nambush. All but one of the mighty Battlestars\nare destroyed and the defenceless home\nplanets are simultaneously attacked.\nCommander Adama (Lome Greene) collects\nthe survivors into a ramshackle convoy and\nheads for a mysterious 13th sister planet,\nsteeped in half-legend etc, etc. It is, of course,\nEarth. The subsequent trek (my spelling) is\nthe excuse for 21 hours of TV serial, like it or\nnot.\nCommander Adama (Lome Green)\nThe resident baddies are adorable robot-like creatures who speak with the dulcet\ntones of an electric razor, brandish plastic\nswords, and have this annoying urge to kill off\nhumanity. Their most endearing characteristics also include being almost\neverywhere at once and being lousy shots,\nproviding endless target practice for our\nheroes. These are Lt Apollo, son of Adama,\nand Lt. Starbuck, a cigar smoking, woman ising, gambling, happy-go-lucky\nmaverick. To quote Larry Grayson, \" Such a nice boy!' The love factor is introduced by\nSerina, a widowed mother, whose son, Boxer,\nhas lost his pet 'dag git'(a dog in gene ou sly disguised as a dog). A robot replacement\ncalled Muffit naturally becomes a sort of\nintergalactic lassie. It still looks like a monkey\nin a fur coat.\nAt last, the cavalry. The film's saving grace\nis the work of special effects-wizard John\nDykstra. Even his superb optical s are marred\nby the fact that they were really designed for\nTV and do not necessarily translate well to the\nbig screen. Well there is not much else to\nrelate except that even though I was\ndisappointed, the film was still enjoyable. I just can not seem to reconcile this dribble\nwith my belief that science fiction must not\njust be perverted into simple 'cowboys and\nindians', however much fun that may be.\nDespite this, for a film which has achieved\nabout as much critical acclaim as 'Watch with\nMother', it is doing amazingly well at the box\noffice - \u00a359,000 in its first week alone. Many\nthanks to Chris Harris for the cartoon.\nWHAT Vt> YOU \u00bb*eH N \u00bb0W \u00bbOWT L.. KE VT? BEA-JH WO Vo^ <,AY l x* \u2014\nThe next bit\nFollowing the success of Star Wars a whole\nhost of films of that genre are soon to hit us. In\nmy mind one of the most promising is a movie\nversion of Star Trek, due for release at\nChristmas. It stars the original cast plus a new captain for the Enterprise and a bald\nheaded woman as 'number one'. Kirk is now\nan Admiral, but when a huge tapioca cloud\nthreatens earth he is recalled from a desk job\nto save all. Great stuff. Another promising\npicture is Alien, which has the look of\nKubrick's\"2001: A Space Odyssey\", from the\npictures I have seen. Disney are also in the\nhunt with an epic called The Black Hole.\nApparently a record number of mattes have\nbeen used to create the 150 special optical\neffects used. Frank Herbert's Dune, trilogy is\nbeing adapted in some form and also\nAsimov'sI Robot. Sir Lew Grade follows up\n'Capricorn One' with Saturn 3. Oh no!!!!\nFrom the rest I would point out two major\nfollow ups. Firstly The Empire Strikes Back\n(Star Wars 2 is way too simple for George\nLucas) which could be brilliant now that even\nmore funds are available. Also we have the\npromised Superman 2, which could be fun.\nThese will not be ready until the new year, but\nin-between we have the new Bond epic\nMoonraker. Roger Stotesbury's tip would\neasily be Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, after\nhaving raved about the novel by Stephen\nKing. When I discovered Jack Nicholson is\nstarring I could only agree. An interesting\nremake called Nosferatu will shortly be\nreleased. This is Werner Herzog's adaptation\nof the dracula legend and could make one of\nEurope's most promising directors an\ninternational figure.\nKeep a special eye open for two very fun ny\nfilms. From America we will soon see The\nKentucky Fried Movie, from the director of\n'Animal House'. Although dull in places this\nhad me in st it iche s. Also there is Monty\nPython's The Life Of Brian. This should be\nreleased in the Summer and is guaranteed to\nraise more than a smile.\nMark Smith\nOne of the Cylons\nFINAL SCORE\nCylons 12\nPeople 1\nRECORDS SUPERTRAMP - BREAKFAST IN AMERICA\nSupertramp are a band with an enigmatic\nquality. What is it? Well, if I knew, it would not\nbe an enigma. Initially shot to fame and\nfortune and the dubious influences that\nsuccess brings with the 'Crime of the\nCentury' album in 1974, they have since kept\na distinctive, melodic, slightly orchestral\nsound that falls short of elaborate sy mph o rock, but stands a cut (or ten) above Pop.\nEverybody knows the name, and most\npeople, when up against the wall, will\nprobably admit to liking their songs. Yet can\nanyone who is not an ardent fan name one of\nthe band? When did they last tour? Are they\nBritish or American? Do they in fact exist?\nThey're hardly obscure - the new album shot\ninto the charts in the top 10 in the first week of\nrelease.\nWhich reminds me - what about this new\nalbum. This is the second that Supertramp\nhave produced since 'relocating' in America\n(from England), and seems in some ways to\nreflect in the lyrics some of the emotions,\nanxieties and so on of moving lock stock and\nbarrel to another country. This is not to say\nthat Supertramp's lyrics are particularly\nprofound or affecting - in fact they really do\nnot stand much examination. As with their\nprevious albums, it is the distinctive style of\nthe two vocalists and the use of strong\nrefrains that keeps the songs from being\nmore than instrumentals with singing. The\nband have always been pretty strong on the\n\n"

But How????\nThe Society of West End\nTheatre (SWET) held a press conference on\nApril the 24th to launch\nthe new scheme which\nshould introduce more\nyoung people to live\ntheatre.\nThis Student Standby\nTicket scheme will operate\nat 34 West End shows\nunfortunately excluding Evita and\none or two others. The idea is for unsold\nseats to be made available to students\nshortly before the show starts at a reduced price. This will be flat for all the\nrange of seats with the reduction\ncounted in pounds rather than pence.\nTrevor Phillips.\nThe actual arrangements for any\nshow are left for the management of\nthat particular concern to set their\nown price etc. This has a big\ndisadvantage from the students'\npoint of view since while they'll know\nthat the scheme is operating, the time\nprior to curtain up, when the tickets\nbecome available and the actual\ncharge is not likely to be published\nand could well change from one night\nto the next.\nThe scheme is receiving the\nsupport of the National Union\nof Students and Trevor Phillips\nwho has recently been reelected President and was at\nthe conference, remarked that\nit was particularly relevant to I.C.\"... if\nthere is any culture at Imperial\nCollege that is!\"\nAlso present, to my sup rise and\ndelight was a star or two including the\ndelicious Susan Hampshire, Richard\nBriers, Bogdan Kominowski, Allan\nLove and Denis Quilley who\nexplained why so many\nknee weakening' personalities were interest-, ed in student tickets.\nFirstly they hate\nplaying before any\nempty seats and\nsecondly they are\nconcerned about the\nfuture of theatre and\nhope that the scheme\nwill encourage a younger\naudience who will laugh at the\njokes that the older patrons seem to\nmiss.\nThe management feel that this idea\nwill do more for them than just bring in\nmore revenue because they believe the\nStandby audience of today will become\nthe full paying middle-aged audience of tomorrow .\nQuestions from the student journalists seemed to indicate that\nthe majority were of the opinion that\nthe scheme did not go far enough. I agree that there is much room for\nimprovement but I would remind\neveryone that you've got to start\nsomewhere.\nCould the scheme extend to school\nchildren? Should it be nationwide?\nThese questions seem so far off.\nMore important,\" What is a recognised Student Card?\" I was\nshocked ... and stunned that the\norganisation hadn't done their\nhomework here. They seemed BY\nJohn Shuttleworth\nunsure but Mr. Phillips leapt to their\nrescue, \" NUS cards, College Student\nUnion cards, NUS discount cards, ISI\nRichard Briers and Susan Hampshire.\ncards;...they are the main ones.\" Of\ncourse that list includes our very own\ngreen, plastic colander so we're OK folks! But just before you all rush off to\nthe West End check in the evening\nnewspapers or in Time Out. That fancy\n'S' symbol is what to look for.\nHappy hunting.\n\n"
