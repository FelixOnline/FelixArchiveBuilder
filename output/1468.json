    "content": "10\nTECHNOLOGY\nfelix\nFRIDAY 8 october 2010\n4chan leaks smut pirate data\nBattles between mainstream film\nand recording industries and the\npublic over piracy issues have always been well documented. But\nthe conflict between porn studios\nand your average pervert have remained largely under wraps.\nThat situation changed last\nweek when 4chan decided to target one of the major legal players ACS:Law. While carrying\nout their plan initially meant intimidating its CEO, they stumbled\nupon an unencrypted text file containing the names of 5000 people\nwho had been accused of pirating\nporn. In typical 4chan style the file\nwas released to the public, causing massive embarrassment for\nACS:Law, Plusnet and BT (not\nto mention the 5000 accused of\ndownloading titles such as \u2018MILF\nMagic 3\u2019).\nThe leak kicked up a cloud of\ndirt for everyone involved and\nonly the porn companies and\n4chan getting any satisfaction\nfrom the matter. It\u2019s also thrown\ninto focus an issue previously un-reported in technology circles - piracy of pornography.\nIt\u2019s well known that of all media\nindustries, pornography has suffered the most at the hand of pira-cy. \u2018Free\u2019 streaming sites lure the\nvast majority of porn consumers\nwho are unwilling to risk dodgy\npayments appearing on their bank\nstatements. Yet one card that the\nporn industry can play is shame;\nmost customers would rather admit to downloading Phil Collins\nthan \u2018Skin City\u2019. ACS:Law is the\nonly remaining British company\nthat extorts money through this\nlegal form of blackmail, with most\nmainstream media labels ditching this practice due to the bad\npublicity it generates. Their strategy is trivial. Upon reciept of an\ninfringing IP address, ACS:Law\ncontacts your ISP and demands\nthe personal details of the person\nfingered by said IP address. Your\nISP is legally required to disclose\nthis information thanks to recently\npassed privacy bills, and before\nyou know it there\u2019s a letter in your\nmail asking you to pay up for your\nillegal download, failing which\nyour name will be released to the\npublic.\nThe scam in itself is legal, and\nit\u2019s easy to see why it might be\nfairly successful. ACS:Law\u2019s\nfailing was in its handling of\nthe confidential user data it was\nhanded by ISPs. The standard\nprocedure that any responsible\ncompany should follow when\nhanded such data is to securely\nencrypt it so that in case any part\nof its infrastructure is compro-mised, the hackers only come\naway with gibberish.\nWhat hackers found on\nACS:Law\u2019s servers wasn\u2019t gibber-ish, but a backup of the entire website including records of emails\nsent by and within the company.\nACS:Law (and the ISPs that handed the firm the information) are\nobliged to encrypt any communication that contains data that could\nbe in breach of the Digital Privacy\nAct. In failing to do so they have\nundergone investigation by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.\nThe ICO\u2019s probing has launched\na tit-for-tat blame game across\nthe board, with the government,\nISPs and ACS:Law all blaming\neach other. ACS:Law looks likely\nto take most of the heat for this -their eagerness to profit off someone else\u2019s misfortune makes them\neasy villains - but it\u2019s worth noting\nthat none of the ISPs seem to have\nhad any qualms about handing\nover the unencrypted information\neither.\nThe legal ramifications of this\nscandal won\u2019t be obvious until\nthe ICO finishes its investiga-tions, but it does raise some serious questions about the quality of\ncurrent legislation. If the government wants to convince us that\nthis is for our benefit, they have\ntheir work cut out for them - in\nthe meantime, you might want to\ntake precautions before grabbing\n\u201cCatch Her In The Eye\u201d off Pirate\nBay.\nFeroz Salam\nZuckerberg: The Man\nThe year 2010 may just be Mark\nZuckerberg\u2019s finest. Having his\nnet worth more than triple to $6.9\nbillion, he has climbed the ranks\nof the Forbes 400 list from #158\nto #35. He even knocked Steve\nJobs off the throne of Geekdom as\nVanity Fair proclaimed him \u201cour\nnew Caesar\u201d by placing him at #1\nin its 100 most influential people\nof the New Establishment. And\nthis month, a biopic based on his\ndramatic founding of Facebook is\ncoming out. Thing is, he\u2019s only 26\nyears old.\nThe Facebook CEO is portrayed\nas a punkish antihero in The Accidental Billionaires, Ben Mezrich\u2019s\ndramatic retelling of the genesis of\nFacebook, which The Social Network is based on. David Kirkpatrick\u2019s The Facebook Effect hails\nhim as a genius of our generation\nwho revolutionized the way we\ninteract with each other. Love him\nor loathe him, one thing\u2019s for sure,\nZuckerberg exudes a peculiar sort\nof charisma.\nThe youngest self-made billionaire ever, he still lives in a rented\nhouse shared with his girlfriend,\nand has stuck to his trademark\nhoodie in every public appear-ance. In the movie, he is portrayed\nas borderline autistic. It may be an\nover-dramatization, but Zuckerberg is well known to be socially\nawkward. He speaks really fast,\noften coming across as nervous,\nbut his words carry solid weight\nand a dead-sure conviction. That\nis the essence of Zuckerberg\u2019s\ncharisma.\nMark\u2019s steadfast and uncompromising vision for Facebook was\nkey to its success today and also\na source of much frustration to his\ncolleagues. The Facebook Effect\nreports that Mark has always been\nadamant about maintaining an enjoyable user experience over rev-enue. He holds the majority of the\ncompany\u2019s board of director seats\nin order to grow Facebook in accordance with his vision. His dic-tatorship-like authority over the\ndirection of the company kept it\nfrom being sold to Yahoo! in 2006\nand being bogged down by ads.\nBut it may also have been behind\nthe reason for the departure of co-founders Dustin Moskowitz and\nChris Hughes as Facebook grew.\nAptly timed before the release of\nThe Social Network, the Facebook\nCEO went on Oprah announcing\na donation of $100 million worth\nof Facebook shares to the Newark\nschool system. Critics think it\u2019s a\npre-emptive move to protect his\nimage. Having read The Accidental Billionaires, I doubt the film\nwill do Mark\u2019s reputation much\nharm. Depicted as a gifted hacker\nwith a disregard for the norms of\nsocial institutions, Zuckerberg\ncomes across as a modern-day\nByronic hero, albeit without the\nwomanizing. It might actually\npropel him to rock-star status (at\nleast in Geekdom). However\nZuckerberg does have reasons to\nbe afraid for his reputation. Earlier this year, Silicon Alley Insider\ngot hold of an old instant message\nlog detailing an exchange between\nZuckerberg and a friend when he\nwas still in Harvard. In the con-versation, Mark called Facebook\nusers \u2018dumb fucks\u2019 for \u2018trusting\u2019\nhim. Zuckerberg later apologized\nin an interview with The New\nYorker, citing his immaturity at that time.\nUser trust is the\ncornerstone of Facebook\u2019s stellar success.\nThe willingness of users to share\ntheir personal information on Facebook has made it the world\u2019s\nmost comprehensive database.\nCheck back next week to find\nout how every bit of info you give\nFacebook makes it the most lucrative Internet start-up ever known\nto mankind.\nGuo Heng Chin\nmodern-day\nwithout the\nt actually\nr status (at\nHowever\nreasons to\nation.

    "content": "ARTS\nFELIX\nFriday 08 October 2010\n20\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nAs the current Joint President of Imperial College\u2019s fine arts society \u2018Leonardo\u2019, I am frequently in touch with some\nof those more creative individuals who\nwash up from the proverbial sea of scientists that form the basis of this univer-sity. These are the people who tire from\ntime to time of the constant prodding,\npoking and general abuse given to the\nfabric of reality. Some of these people,\nhowever, see it as a full-time job to give\nthe fabric of reality a bit of a miss and\nlive in a world without boundaries or\nrules, sticking with just the imagination.\nOne of these people is artist, curator\nand general go-getter Mindy Lee, who\nworks as the curator of Imperial\u2019s only\nart gallery \u2018The Blyth Gallery\u2019. I decided to corner her for a bit of a chat and\nsee what\u2019s swinging at the moment in\nthe world of Imperial art.\nHow long have you held the role of curator of the Blyth Gallery?\n6 years in December.\nLongest I\u2019ve ever worked is seven\nweeks\u2026 So in all that time have you\never held an exhibition that really\nstood out from the rest? If so what\nwas it?\nI think the most unusual show was\n\u2018Where the wild Things Are\u2019 by Tessa\nFarmer and Laura Youngson Coll in\n2006. It was an exhibition of very delicate and miniature sculptures. When you\nfirst entered the gallery, it looked almost\nempty and then an intriguing miniature\nworld of strange and beautiful monstrosities revealed themselves. If the viewer\ndid not have a curious investigative\nnature, you could almost walk through\nthe gallery and think it was completely\nempty.\nAny disaster stories?\nI think one of the most worrying moments was installing a sculptural piece\nof work made by Jodie Carey, which\nwas largely made out of icing. As soon\nas it was installed in the gallery, the\npiece started to sweat under the heat of\nthe lights. Luckily we relit the space,\nand the sculpture survived.\nMmm sounds tasty! As an artist, do\nyou have a favoured medium (other\nthan icing)?\nI am essentially a painter, who also\nworks with collage and drawing.\nBeing in the art field for so long have\nyou ever crossed paths with any famous artists?\nCornelia Parker and Banksy are probably the two most well known artists I\nhave met.\nNice! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of very\njealous people out there, me included!\nHow about your work though, do you\nfrequently get to exhibit your own\nstuff?\nI exhibit reasonably frequently. I am\nabout to show a painting and collage\npiece as a part of the Double Trouble\nexhibition. I have also just exhibited a\nsolo collage and painting installation in\nthe Jerwood Project Space titled: Spatter Platter. Installation was a new area\nfor me to work in and it took me over six\nmonths to make something that would\nbe seen site-specifically and read as one\npiece. It is good to test your artistic practice by making new and ambitious work\nyou are unfamiliar or uncomfortable\nwith. This is how your creative practice\ndevelops.\nOk, so if I happened to have a big bag\nof money would I be able to buy of\nsome of your work from the upcoming \u2018Double Trouble\u2019 exhibition?\nMost pieces of work in the Double Trouble exhibition are for sale.\nWell I don\u2019t have a big bag of money,\nbut it\u2019s good to know.\nMoving on a bit, do you think there\nshould be more art work around Imperial?\nYes more art work around Imperial\nwould be beneficial, as well as more exposure into reading art. This would help\nviewers of the work move beyond thinking about art in terms of an aesthetic\neye candy and move towards a deeper\nunderstanding of visual communication.\nI do give regular talks on reading art in\nan exhibition, so if anyone is interested,\nplease keep your eyes peeled on the following web-link: http://www3.imperial.\nac.uk/arts/visualart/artworkshops.\nBit of subtle advertising there, I commend that. Most importantly though,\nwhat\u2019s your favourite colour?\nRed.\nSo there you have it: Mindy Lee, successful artist, dynamite curator and with\na good solid favourite colour at that.\nIf you\u2019d like to know more about the\nBlyth Gallery and what goes on there,\nyou can check it out online at http://\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/arts/visualart or\nsubscribe to the gallery mailing list by\nemailing gallery@imperial.ac.uk from\nyour Imperial email.\nMindy Lee, Blyth gallery curator with Double Trouble which opened on Tuesday\nChris Clarke\nGilead Amit, Deputy Editor, kicks off\nour new feature with his favourite\nwork of literature.\nWe quiz Mindy Lee,\nCurator of Imperial\u2019s\nBlyth Gallery\nDouble Trouble\nin the Blyth Gallery on 5th floor\nof the Sherfield\nbuilding runs\nuntil 5th Nov.\nTell us about your favourite book in 300-400 words\nand send it to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOur own Artist\nGosh. Cripes. Blimey. What a responsibility. I have\njust been asked by the delightful new Arts editor\nto inaugurate this column by writing a short, pithy\npiece on my favourite book. Publicity whore that I\nam, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to refuse.\nBut, though gratified to have been offered this\nprivileged position, I cannot suppress a twinge of\nguilt. Should I really be the one writing this column?\nThat would imply that I have a favourite book I would\nlike to talk about. But rack my brains as I might, the\nfortune cookie of my mind sadly reveals itself to be\nempty. Or rather, it appears to be embarrassingly\nfull of questions.\nWhat is a favourite book, anyway? What does it\nfeel like when you read it? When you turn the last\npage and read the final paragraph, knowing you will\nnever again have the delight of reading it for the\nfirst time? What does it feel like to be so assured\nabout your emotional bond with a work of art that\nyou can say, without a hint of pretension, that it is\nyour \u2018favourite\u2019?\nI\u2019m afraid that once the spigot opens, the torrent\nof questions can\u2019t be stopped. What criteria do we\nuse to classify a favourite book? Are we talking form\nor content? The unread first edition hardback that\ngives you a secret thrill of pleasure each time you\nsee it on your shelf, or the masterpiece you\u2019d still\nhappily read in evanescent e-book form?\nSo far, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree, there have been\ntoo many questions and too few answers. So let\u2019s\nstop flagellating around the shrubbery and get to\nthe point: What is my favourite book?\nThe simple answer? I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m not being\ncoy or intentionally contrarian, I just genuinely don\u2019t\nknow. What I can tell you, though, is which book I\nwill round this piece off by recommending: the staggering De Profundis by Oscar Fingal O\u2019Flahertie\nWills Wilde. It\u2019s an odd choice, but that\u2019s only to be\nexpected from an odd individual.\nIn all of its impeccably chosen 50,000 or so\nwords, it is as far removed as it is possible to imagine from the world of the adventure novel or the action thriller. That\u2019s probably owing to its nature as a\nletter written behind bars by the imprisoned Oscar\nWilde to his former lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, better known as \u2018Bosie\u2019. Hardly the sort of stuff that\nRobert Downey Jr. blockbusters are made of.\nDespite the rather kitschy description I seem to\nhave given it, the simple truth is that nothing I have\never read has even come close to moving me in a\nsimilar manner.\nI could try to set down more of my thoughts here\non paper, but you\u2019ll notice that I have craftily not\ngiven myself enough space. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t\nwant you to waste your time reading what I have to\nsay about the book. I want you to read it. I want you\nto read others. And then I want you to write in to\nFelix and explain why I should be reading them too.\nby\nOscar Wilde\nDe Profundis\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 08 October 2010 17\nWhat\u2019s wrong with camping? Everything...\nI\ndon\u2019t know what you got up to\nwith your summer. Maybe you\nwent home, met up with some old\nfriends and took it easy. Maybe\nyou took off around the world in\na glamorous jet-set holiday. Maybe you\nengaged in a whirlwind fling of summer\nromance (like a forest-fire, it was short-lived but passionate and not the least bit\nlegal). I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m just guessing.\nAs for me, I went camping.\nThis might not sound exciting but a\nweek spent in a field can be entertaining,\nenlightening and occasionally death-de-fying \u2013 everything you could want from\na holiday at home.\nNow admittedly, the week can start on\na pretty grim note as you realise exactly\nwhy the wilderness is so-called. More\nexperienced adventurers will laugh at\nyour vain attempts to get a wi-fi signal\nhalfway up a tree and the number of\nplants you try and plug a phone-charger\ninto. If the end of the world happened\nwhile you were camping, you can be\nsure you wouldn\u2019t hear about it until you\nrejoin the M5.\nThings don\u2019t improve drastically\nwhen, on an exploratory walk-about,\nyou get your first glimpse of the bathroom facilities \u2013 that is, if there are any.\nOne look at those anachronistic monstrosities of iron and porcelain and your\nbuttocks will seal shut for no less than a\nweek. I\u2019ve heard that on longer sojourns,\nthey\u2019ve actually healed over completely.\nThe only exception to this being the one\nnight you have curry. When this hap-pens, make sure you have a clear plan of\nall available exits; you will need them.\nThe British weather being what it is, if\nyou go camping during the summer, you\nwill certainly need a good set of waterproof clothing. All waterproofs are wa-terproof. The million-dollar question is\nfor how long? The nemesis of all campers is a sky so black even emos forego\nthe colour in wallpaper swatches on the\ngrounds that it is too depressing. However, remain ever vigilant for the oppo-site. Without a doubt, the most glorious\nsight on a camp-site is the first ray of\nsunlight and blue sky after a\nstorm. Many have sought\nthis vision; few have witnessed it.\nIf you decide to\ninvite your friends\nalong on a camping holiday, the\nopportunities\nfor pranks\nare limitless. Remember, sleeping in\nthe same tent as someone is as intimate as having sex with them, with\nthe same capacity for betrayal. Pranks\ncan range from the simple, the stan-dard, like drawing on their face with a\nsharpie or toothpaste on the eyebrows,\nto the daring, like dragging their sleeping bag out into the middle of the field\nat night (bonus points if it\u2019s raining), to\nthe borderline-psychopathic, like leaving a sheep\u2019s head in their sleeping bag.\nHowever, be aware that you are vulnerable to retribution and retaliation. If you\nprank someone on the first night, don\u2019t\nexpect to get much sleep for the rest of\nthe week \u2013 sleeping with one eye open\nis tiring work.\nAnd that\u2019s just the fun you can have\nin the field. Just wait until you get out\nand ex- plore the local attractions.\nOf course, you won\u2019t be\nstaying near anywhere\nbig \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s\nthe countryside \u2013\nand because of the\nlack of any serious\ntourism, any attractions nearby\nwon\u2019t rate\nmuch above\nDear Jane Neary,\nI started my PhD in February, and have\noften frequented the SCR for lunch despite only terrible experiences. As you\nare Head of Catering, I wish to express\nmy grievances concerning the quality\nof the food and propose some urgent\nchanges. I am a reasonable person, yet\nthis has gone too far, and I cannot go on\nwithout raising my frustrations.\nYou must be aware us students work\nhard, and encounter difficult steps in our\nstudies. Nothing helps someone through\nthe day like a hearty lunch (call it brain\nfuel). Yet the SCR food is best described as horrendous - if a brain is like\nan engine, would you put super leaded\ninto it or sewage? The vegetables are\novercooked, and flavourless. The sole\nsaviour is a dollop of tartar sauce from\nthe cutlery counter - simply desperate\ntimes screaming for desperate measures.\nSince when did lasagne get served with\npotatoes or sweetcorn?? Who thought\nof that?? I mean REALLY?!? Would\nyou send my Gran on a bus holiday to\nIbiza?!? I would have hoped your chefs\nunderstood food combinations. What\nnext? Fried chicken with a side portion\nof plums?\nI am amazed people eat at the SCR; it\nmust be due to the convenience of the\nlocation. I have stopped going and now\nwalk to Bute Street where there are fresh\nsandwiches with the best ingredients at\na cost comparable to the sludge that is\nthe SCR Roast and Yorkshire pudding,\nwhich resembles some sort of genital\nwart. It\u2019s an example any economics\nprofessor would love to use to demonstrate the benefits of vibrant competition\nin the market place.\nI appreciate the food needs to be\ncheap, but there\u2019s no need to compromise with quality. As the saying goes,\nyou are what you eat and eating is one of\nlife\u2019s great pleasures. The key to a good,\ncheap meal is keep it simple. Don\u2019t do a\nroast, or lamb - these are things which\nonly work when the best produce is cho-sen, which would cost too much. If you\ncouldn\u2019t afford a Ferrari, you wouldn\u2019t\njust take a Fiat Panda, paint it red, and\nchuck a horse in the back seat. You need\nfresh ingredients and people who enjoy\ncooking. Pasta can be the most wonderful dish in the world, but only if cooked\nfor the right amount of time! Overcook\nit, and it\u2019ll be as disastrous as the SCR\nbroccoli.\nYour website further aggravates my\nconcerns. To quote, \u201cthe menu includes\n\u2018bistro style\u2019 hot meals, gourmet salad\nbar, and a delicious selection of desserts.\u201d Never in my life have I read such\nan exaggeration of the word GOURMET! Gourmet is a cultural ideal associated with fine food and drink - you are\nmad if you think the SCR gets close to\nthis ideal\u2026 if the ideal is Kiera Knightley, the SCR is John Prescott. I won\u2019t\neven get started on the liberal use of the\nword delicious\u2026 and BISTRO? A word\nassociated with the hustle and bustle of\nrestaurants that lie on picturesque Parisian street corners\u2026 imagine your partner saying, \u2018darling, fancy some delightful bistro food?\u2019 and then being taken to\nthe SCR! I only hope the website uses\nthe words in jest.\nJemma, do not mistake my tone; I\nam deadly serious. I genuinely cannot\nurge you enough to start radicalising\nthe SCR. I had enough of liquidised\nRhys Davies\n\u201cAll waterproofs\nare waterproof.\nThe million-dollar\nquestion is for how\nlong?\u201d\ntwo stars. On the plus side, by the time\nyou\u2019ve seen the Agatha Christie Museum, your waterlogged camp-site will\nlook positively inviting!\nLet me summarise all this. You can\nalmost guarantee that the weather and\nthe facilities will be crap, the only thing\nstanding between you and a watery\ngrave is a thin sheet of canvas, you will\ndiscover that all your friends are closet\nsociopaths and by definition, there will\nbe nothing within a reasonable radius\nto see or do. And yet I still maintain\nthat there is something nice, something\nquintessentially pure, about getting out\nof the city, leaving Facebook and Twitter behind. It\u2019s not provincial and it\u2019s not\nnostalgia for a lost age but it just feels\ngood to be...unattached.\nWhen you go camping, you don\u2019t have\nto worry about bills and rent, news and\ncelebrities, friends and family even (de-pending on who you\u2019ve brought along).\nNone of that matters since you\u2019re not in\na position to do anything about them. In\na world the size of a field, your concerns\ndwindle to food, dry (not necessarily\nclean) clothing and a few vagaries about\nrope and canvas.\nAnd if this still doesn\u2019t sound like your\ncup of tea, there\u2019s always Lanzarote.\npeas and lumpy mashed potato weeks\nago, and I won\u2019t be the last. I have the\nsupport of numerous students and staff\n- some do say the food has recently im-proved, though you can\u2019t polish a turd.\nYour website states \u201cSCR meals are produced by award winning chefs from the\n2009 TUCO University Chef of the Year\ncontest.\u201d You must be joking?!? I have\nnever heard of that contest, but put your\nchefs on Professional Masterchef and\nlet\u2019s see how they do - I\u2019ll eat my hat\nLetters\nAn open letter\nto Jane Neary,\nthe Head of\nCatering\nif they even get an audition. Why don\u2019t\nthey make fresh pesto from scratch?\nWhy do they always overcook the meat?\nPerhaps the award was merely a case of\nthe mediocre beating the horrific?\nI don\u2019t have much hope - change never\ncomes easily. I had to express my grum-blings and I hope you listen and take ac-tion.\nBest regards,\nCharles Betts\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 08 October 2010 15\nBUSINESS\nImperial students storm the City\nThe College was well represented, with students interning at every major corporation and business area. Students share their views on the summer internships below\nwork other people do. Sit with them, ask\nthem questions. Obviously be intelligent\nin the way that you approach anyone and\nalways use common sense, but people\nusually like talking about their job, provided you pick the right moment. It is\nthe only you way you can find out if you\nwill be happy in any job or in any in-dustry. Be aware that there is no shame\nin realising you do not actually like the\nindustry, the culture or the work. Not everyone wants to work 80+ hour weeks in\nan extremely competitive environment.\nYou are better off coming to this realisation during the internship when there\nis time left to figure out alternatives for\nwhen you graduate, than starting a full-time job you really hate.\nSomething many internship applicants also fail to conceptualise is that\ncultural and personal fit is extremely\nimportant, and the reason there are so\nmany interviews. Whoever employs\nyou will be spending more time around\nyou than their own family, so building a personal rapport is of utmost\nimportance. It is imperative that you\nlike the firm and the firm likes you.\nIf this doesn\u2019t happen, things can turn\nsour very easily. When recruiters mention culture, we tend to think it is just\na buzzword, but after spending a long\nsummer interning, you will see that this\nis rarely the case.\nIt is only the first issue of the year, but\nalready time is wearing thin. For most\nfirms, it absolutely pays off to apply\nearlier rather than later, as a lot of firms\noffer places on a rolling basis. With this\nin mind, make sure you attend the Careers Fair happening 27th October on\nthe Queen\u2019s Lawn Marquee - there will\nbe dozens of employers from whom you\nwill be able to get a really fantastic insight into companies, provided you ask\nthe right questions. It\u2019s also a great place\nto start selling yourself to companies that\nyou know you are already interested in.\nJust make sure you leave hubris at home.\nGet applying now and most impo-rantly remember the following winning\ncocktail of characteristics in anything\nyou do: be personable, be hungry, be intelligent and be humble.\nMarc Kerstein\nMathematics\nCredit Suisse\nI admit I was slightly apprehensive before joining Credit\nSuisse as a Summer Analyst. Despite having a strong\nbackground in technology,\nthe financial industry can first\nseem intimidating to many.\nFortunately, my team in Credit\nSuisse instantly made me\nfeel comfortable and showed\nme around the firm, introducing me to the many different\nteams. I began to realise that\nlearning about the role was\nsomewhat less important\nthan general exposure to the\nbank, and I managed to learn\na wide variety of skills. After\nwhat were 10 thoroughly enjoyable weeks. I was finally sad to\nleave, but will keep in touch\nwith my colleagues until I return to the team in July next\nyear.\nAfonso Campos\nPhysics\nBarclays Capital\nI joined Barclays Capital in\ncommodities and was extremely happy with the asset\nclass. There is no doubt that\nthis internship has solidified\nmy desire to work in the in-dustry. Barcap operates an extremely well thought out objectives programme throughout\nthe summer. One of the objec-tives, and perhaps one of the\nbest things about the entire\ninternship, was to meet with a\nminimum of 3 managing directors and 7 directors. It goes\nto show how approachable everyone at the firm is and how\nwilling they are to share the\nexperience that has led them\nto where they are today. I am\nfortunate to be able to return\nto Barcap next summer and I\nam really looking forward to it.\nNikhil Howai\nBiomedical Engineering\nErnst & Young\nI interned at Ernst & Young in\ntheir advisory division. Its client base is quite impressive\nand it\u2019s common for graduates\nto gain experience with companies like BP, Barclays and\nApple in their first year. The internship program holds an induction week during which we\nwere even given free accommo-dation. I then was introduced\nto my division and assigned to\nmy first client. To ensure I got\nthe most out of the experience\nE&Y rotated me through a new\nclient each week, allowing me\nto gain experience with different companies. The internship\nwas amazing; everyone was\nsuper laid back and seemed\nto genuinely enjoy their job. I\u2019d\nrecommend applying to E&Y if\nyou have the opportunity.\nBe sure to attend the Careers Fair on the 27th of October on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn. And try not to stare at the company representative\u2019s lips either...\n\u201cMany internship\napplicants fail to\nunderstand that\npersonal fit is\nextremely important\u201d\nSaleem Butt\nChemistry\nResearch Lab, Germany\nLast summer instead of going\nto a bank like most my friends\nI interned at a research lab in\nGermany. The program was\nfunded by the German Exchange body, DAAD, and was\na summer I will never forget.\nIt was great to get first hand\nexperience of working in a research lab and actually use\nthe skills I have learnt in the\nchemistry lab while at Imperial.\nOn top of that I got the opportunity to live in another country\nin probably the coolest city in\nEurope and immerse myself in\na completely new culture and\nenvironment.\nThe experience definitely\nadds something to my CV,\nwhich is something that will\nmake me stand out to my future employers.\nChristopher Walmsley\nPhysics\nDeutsche Bank\nI interned at Deutsche Bank\nin the technology division,\naligned with the distressed\ncredit desk. The wake of the\nrecession made this area\nparticularly interesting to be\nworking in. The role was a non\ntechnical business analyst\nrole giving me plenty of exposure to the business unit and\ncommunicating with offshore\ndevelopment teams. The 9\nweek summer internship gave\ninvaluable experiance working\nin working on real projects and\nhaving to present my reports\nto senior stakeholders within\nthe business. I found the internship as a whole incredibly\nwell structured with excellent\nsupport framework, and after\nwork there was also a good social life with the other intens.\n\n"

Jovan Nedic\nCryptic Crossword 1,435\nA\nnother year, another season and for some bizarre\nreason, I am still here!\nOn top of that, I\u2019m back\ndoing the same section I\nstarted doing four years ago \u2013 well, the\nlast time I did this section we won paper\nof the year, so you never know...\nI\u2019ve been at Imperial for so long that\nI\u2019ve gone full circle with the calendar\ndates. Yes, on this date six years ago I\nwas hitting daVinci\u2019s and dB\u2019s, what you\nguys now call FiveSixEight and Metric\n(not that they were open during Freshers\u2019 Week Welcome Week), for the last\nnight of Freshers\u2019 Week - which, thanks\nto the geniuses in the Union building is\nnow called Welcome Week. And what\nreason do they give for this \u2013 \u2018oh the\npostgraduates feel left out and don\u2019t get\ninvolved as much as the first year students\u2019. Of course I fucking don\u2019t, I\u2019ve\nalready done one freshers\u2019 week and it\nwas a killer to the liver, why the fuck\nwould I want to do it again? And on top\nof that, I\u2019ve got work to do! But at least\nyou have got the post-grad Mingle to-morrow...\nAnyway, so by now you have had your\nintroductory lecture, some of you would\nhave had a surprise test that you probably weren\u2019t expecting, but more importantly you went to Freshers\u2019 Fair and\nfound some clubs and societies to get\ninvolved with. Some of you even had\nthe excitement of trials on Wednesday\nbefore hitting the Union for your first\nSports Night (again, another thing that\nno longer exists!) So what\u2019s next?\nExpect a few events to get yourself\nbetter acquainted with the rest of your\nteam-mates; a Club Captains\u2019 Welcome\nDrinks or a Freshers\u2019 Tour somewhere\nshould do the trick. If all else fails, there\nis the ever-dependable ACC bar night\nthat will definitely ease you in. Soon\nenough, you will have learnt about your\nteam-mates, learnt a few songs to sing in\nthe bar, and most importantly, you will\nhave learnt who the old foe is!\nSeeing as I am getting on a bit, I hope\nyou will allow me to impart some wisdom and advice to you all. It is through\ncompetition and rivalry that you find\nloyalty and a sense of belonging. The\nextreme of this is obviously war, with\nloyal soldiers fighting to protect their\nway of life. Sports offer the same sense\nof loyalty and camaraderie, but obviously without the killing - just look at\nthe thousands of fans that go to watch\ntheir club or country play every week.\nThe same happens at university.\nEvery week you run out onto the pitch,\ncourt or pool (probably shouldn\u2019t run to\nthe pool, wet floors and all that...) ready\nto represent your team, your club and\nyour university against an opposition\nwho are ready to do the same. When we\nhave a common enemy, that is when we\nall come together and rally behind the\nImperial banner, or the Medicals ban-ner, as the teams do battle against the\nold enemy! This sense of loyalty and the\naccompanied rivalry is why the students\nwho play sports (there are a few other\nnon-sporting examples) become one\nof the most involved alumni, regularly\nkeeping in touch with the club. Some\neven have alumni teams that play on\nSaturdays. But this rivalry is capable of\nbringing so many alumni together, not\njust the sporty types. Just look at the\nOxford-Camridge Boat Race, the RSMCSM Bottle Match or any College Football game in the USA. Alumni come in\ntheir hundreds and thousands to watch\ntheir alma matter play against the old en-emy, some giving generous donations to\nmake sure that they keep on beating the\nold enemy. Imperial\u2019s rivalry between\nthe College and the Medicals is slowly\nbuilding up and every year, more and\nmore people are turning up to the JPR\nWilliams Cup in particular. Who knows,\nwe might eventually get enough people\ncoming back to support that the game\nwould have to move to bigger venues,\nlike that stadium in Twickenham...\nIf you are reading this and you are\nnot part of some team (and this does not\nnecessarily mean a sports team), I urge\nyou to join some club or society because\neven though they will take up some of\nyour time now, they will introduce you\nto some of your closest friends for years\nto come! Plus it will give you something\nto talk about in interviews.\nLike I said, I\u2019ve been here for a while\nand won\u2019t be around for ever, so I would\nlove it if I could get someone else to\nget involved with the sports section. If\nyou\u2019re interested, send me an email at\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk!\nSo what\u2019s new this year? Well as you\nmay have noticed, we\u2019ve managed to get\na sponsor for the sports section, which\ncan only mean good things for you!\nWinners of the sports league, which has\ngrown from strength to strength, will\nreceive polo shirts sponsored by Ernst\n& Young and we are also thinking of\ngetting a shield to go in the Union Bar\nso that everyone can know who the best\nteam at Imperial really are! We\u2019re also\nplanning on having a Sports in Brief sec-tion, where we would like all the captains to send a quick e-mail after their\ngame on Wednesday, letting us know\nhow they went on.\nSo, here we go again, good luck ev-eryone, and keep us informed.\nTexas State get this many people to their football games...

    "content": "FELIX Friday 08 October 2010 9\nFEATURE\nSCIENTISTS RALLY TO\nFIGHT FUNDING CUTS\nO\nn Saturday the 9th of\nOctober, over 2,000 scientists and science supporters will rally at Westminster to protect the\nfuture of British science. Their aim is\nto make the government reconsider any\nspending cuts to be made in the fields\nof research and development, cuts that\nscientists fear could cause the country\nlong-term damage.\nThey are rapidly running out of time\nto make their voices heard, however,\nif they hope to influence Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s Governmental\nSpending Review, which will be publically announced on the 20th. The cuts\ndetailed on that day will certainly be\ndraconian and decisive - but nobody as\nyet knows where they will fall.\nIt is in this tense atmosphere that on\nthe 8th of September Lib Dem cabinet\nmember Vince Cable delivered a speech\nat Queen Mary, University of London.\nIn it, the newly-appointed Secretary of\nState for Business, Innovation and Skills\n(BIS) made it clear that deep cuts in his\ndepartment were unavoidable.\nSince the Chancellor\u2019s emergency\nbudget was revealed in June of this year,\ngovernment departments have been agonising over how best to apportion the\nenormous spending cuts that need to be\nmade. In what Whitehall sources have\nreferred to as \u2018a do-able nightmare\u2019, the\nTreasury hopes to cut public spending\nby \u00a36.2 billion over the coming year.\nIf the load were to be divided equally\namong all 16 governmental depart-ments, then each minister would need to\nreduce their budget by around 15%. The\nCoalition\u2019s priorities, however, mean\nthat some departments are more heavily hit than others. The NHS budget, for\ninstance, will be protected in full, and\nsome defence spending is also exempt.\nThis means that the reduction in\nspending expected from departments\nsuch as Vince Cable\u2019s will rise to nearly\n25% over a four-year period. And as Cable\u2019s department bears responsibility for\nscience as well as for business, scientists\nhave been anxiously scrutinising his priorities in an attempt to predict what lies\nin store for them.\nThey got a glimpse of the answer when\nhe stepped up to speak at the Queen\nMary BioEnterprises Innovation Centre. In a speech more memorable for the\nquestions it left unanswered than for any\ndefinite proposals it contained, Vince\nCable succeeded in sending shockwaves\nthrough the scientific establishment.\nPerhaps the most memorable phrase\n(one of several leaked to the BBC and\nthe Guardian on the previous night)\ncame with his assertion that he supports\n\u201ctop class \u2018blue skies\u2019research, but there\nis no justification for taxpayers\u2019 money\nbeing used to support research which is\nneither commercially useful nor theoretically outstanding.\u201d\nScience supporters across the board\nhave come out against this comment,\nwhich they feel is indicative of a wor-ryingly \u2018short-termist\u2019 view of the benefits of scientific research. According\nto a 2008 report by the Campaign for\nScience and Engineering (CaSE), every\npound invested into medical research\nyields an annual return of 30p in perpe-tuity. This is a message echoed by the\n2010 OECD report on innovation in\ntimes of austerity, which stressed that\n\u201ccutting innovation provides short-term\nrelief but damages long-term growth.\u201d\nOthers have criticised Vince Cable\u2019s\ndescription of 45% of publicly-funded\nresearch as \u2018mediocre\u2019. Robert May,\nformerly Chief Scientific Adviser to the\nUK Government as well as President of\nthe Royal Society, points out that for a\ncountry with barely 1% of the global\npopulation to produce 8% of the scientific publications and receive 12% of the\nassociated citations is no mean feat. In\nrelation to net wealth, the UK comes top\nout of the G8 countries in terms of the\nnumber of papers published annually.\nThe worry among scientists today is\nthat this privileged position at the forefront of international research may well\nbe slipping away. The Royal Society\nmade it clear in their submission to the\nTreasury that any cut in funding made\ntoday would ripple out and have a significantly larger impact in the long term.\nIn their words, a cut of over 20% would\nrepresent a \u2018game over\u2019 scenario.\nThe nightmare situation would see\nBritain undergoing a \u2018brain drain\u2019, in\nwhich all the leading researchers and\nacademics leave the country in search of\ngreener pastures abroad. As can be seen\nfrom reports published by the UK\u2019s top\nsix universities, this scenario is danger-The Government\u2019s Spending Review looms ever closer,\nand UK science research is in peril. By Gilead Amit\nously close to materialising.\nIf the \u00a33.5 billion science budget were\nto drop by nearly a billion pounds, then\nthe UK would also need to reconsider its\ncommitments to expensive, large-scale\nresearch projects. The Diamond Light\nSource and Isis, two Oxfordshire-based\nprojects that respectively cost \u00a328m\nand \u00a335m a year to run, would almost\ncertainly need to be put on hold. Professor Brian Cox, one of the UK\u2019s better-known science broadcasters, has compared the mothballing of either of these\nprojects to acts of \u2018vandalism\u2019, which\n\u201cwould irreparably damage physics in\nthe UK at all levels\u201d.\nIn an attempt to protest against any\nsuch drastic measures, a group of concerned scientists and science supporters\nhave spent the last month setting up the\n\u2018Science is Vital\u2019 campaign. Led and\nsupported by a range of individuals from\nformer Imperial rector Sir Roy Anderson to renowned astronomer Sir Patrick\nMoore, the group hopes to open the government\u2019s eyes to the benefits associated\nwith investment in the sciences.\nThey cite the unprecedented funding\nbeing awarded to research and development by the governments of India,\nChina, France and Germany, many of\nwhom are doing so at times of national\nstringency in other fields. France, for in-stance, will be investing \u20ac35 billion in\nresearch while at the same time cutting\ndefence spending by nearly \u20ac5 billion.\nAll this raises the legitimate question\nas to whether or not the government\nhas set the country on the right course\nto emerge from these difficult economic\ntimes. To take an example from recent\nhistory, both Finland and South Korea\nused science investment as a powerful\nengine to take them out of the perilous\nwaters of recession they had sailed into\nin the 1990s.\nOn the 9th of October, the Science\nis Vital campaigners will be meeting\nin Westminster to protest outside the\nTreasury building.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 08 October 2010 33\nTRAVEL\nSeven Imperial medical students travelled to\nKenya with the Kenyan Orphan Project this\nsummer, and improved the lives of vulnerable\nchildren and orphans. By Colleen McGregor\nMy Kenyan holiday with a difference\nO\nur first three days were\nspent in Kochogo, a rural\nsettlement near Kisumu,\nthe third largest city in\nKenya. Our first port-of-call was the Kochogo Feeding Centre\nwhich provides lunch and dinner to over\n150 orphans, many of whom would have\notherwise suffered malnutrition and\neventual death. The feeding centre also\nreaches out to the wider community by\nsupporting elderly widows, who are unable to cook for themselves. During our\ntime there, we helped prepare food (one\nof the Imperial girls skinned a chicken!)\nand washed dishes but the real joy of\nworking at the feeding centre were\nthe children. We served children their\nmeals, comprising staples such as rice\nand beans and also ate with them, which\ngave us our first taste of Kenyan food;\nugali in particular being very foreign to\nus all \u2013 a dish made of just maize flour\nand water with an \u2018unusual\u2019 consistency.\nAfter lunch we would play with the\nchildren, teaching them new games\nwhilst they would teach us their favourite songs and entertain us with their\ndancing. The children went crazy for\nour cameras. They never tired of taking\nphotos of themselves with shouts of \u201cme\nago, me ago (my go, my go).\u201d\nThe walls of the feeding centre were\nnoticeably bland and boring; we were\ntasked with designing and paint murals\nthat were educational and fun. Imperial\u2019s design (by Zainab) taught the children what to eat as part of a balanced\ndiet. Other students continued with\nmurals teaching the alphabet and hand\nhygiene; all of which made the feeding\ncentre brighter and more stimulating.\nLater we went to the local health\ncentre, which consisted of a small\nclinic that housed a two-bed observation ward, pharmacy and consultation\nrooms run by a doctor-led team. While\nwe were there we had the opportunity\nto clerk patients and conduct our own\nconsultations \u2013 diagnosing and planning treatment. It was inspiring to see\nthe doctors and nurses there delivering\nfantastic care in such difficult circum-stances, for example the centre had no\nelectricity and the fridge (which contained vital vaccines) was run by gas\ncylinders, at great cost to the centre.\nOur final day in Kochogo was at the\nlocal primary schools. We took it in\nturns to teach a health related topic, such\nas schistosomiasis or malaria. Many pupils spoke fluent English as their mother\ntongue was discouraged in school, so\nlanguage was hardly a barrier. Although\nresources were lacking and classrooms\nwere frequently overcrowded, every pupil was diligent and keen to learn \u2013 we\ncould barely keep up with all the questions they were asking!\nFrom Kochogo we went to Alendu\nwhere we were throughly outclassed\nby the girls from the Alendu Secondary\nSchool. They challenged us to a netball\nmatch and though our team ranged in\nability, we were determined to win. With\nonly one goal post at either side but no\ndiscernable lines to mark out the court \u2013\nthe larger area of play tested our fitness.\nWhile we had trainers, the barefooted\nAlendu girls had the advantage of youth\nand acclimatisation to the weather. By\nhalf time it felt like we\u2019d been playing\nforever (15 minutes!). We were tired and\nthe Alendu girls were strong. Despite a\nstrong attack and defence, the bell rang\nand the final score read Alendu 4: KOP\n3.\nWe were in Alendu to help build a\nschool. For many of us building was a\nnew experience but despite the midday\nheat and our mainly female team, we did\nremarkably well. Whilst some us mixed\ncement on the ground or fetched water\nand bricks, a few braver team members\nwere up on the roof (via a wooden ladder and no scaffolding) laying bricks.\nThe final third module was based in\nthe large town Kismusu, where we visited local hospitals and more KOP project\npartners. Our experiences in the two public hospitals were certainly challenging.\nStaff and resource shortages were major\nissues, as was availability of beds. It was\nnot uncommon to see three men sharing\none hospital bed and up to 80% of patients were HIV positive, so HIV-related\nconditions were common, as were ma-laria, tuberculosis and other tropical dis-eases. More emphasis was put on history\nand examination of the patient, and the\nstaff were amazingly resourceful with\nthe little resources they had.\nFinally we visited project partners\nVijana Maarufu Development Group\n(VIMA) and Hope for Victoria Children (HOVIC). VIMA supports underprivileged children by sponsoring their\neducation, ensuring an adequate home\nenvironment and providing for their\nhealthcare needs. Each university group\nsupports a project and this year Imperial\nis backing VIMA. We visited the school\nof one of the VIMA-supported children,\nwhere we lead a Q&A session hosted by\nthe school\u2019s health club. Whilst it was an\nenjoyable experience, some of the questions were harrowing as they touched on\nabuse and sexual exploitation. Thankfully we were able to answer the questions with sensitivity and point the students in the direction of support groups\nsuch as VIMA.\nHOVIC is a centre for street children;\nmainly home to boys from 10-18 years\nold. The centre includes a dining hall,\nclassrooms, workshops, mini library\nand a nurses\u2019 room \u2013 keeping the boys\noccupied throughout the day. The boys\nare subject to a routine very much like\nschool and we were able to join them\nduring their sports session, debating\nsociety and arts workshop where they\ntaught us to make sculptures out of soap-stone.\nOne of the highlights of our trip was\nthe project party hosted by HOVIC. We\nenjoyed food and entertainment put on\nby the youth, from skits to dancing. At\none point all of the staff, students and\nchildren were dancing together to traditional music under the night sky \u2013 a\nwonderful experience I will never for-get.\n\u201cOur experiences in the two public hospitals\nwere certainly challenging\u201d\nSpare time enjoyed by the waterfront... not much of a beach is it? \u201cGreen stripes... must remember to get green stripes...\u201d\nGrooving with the kids at HOVIC\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 08 October 2010\n6\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial College is set to open its first teaching institution abroad - a medical school in\nSingapore. The project is run alongside Nanyang Technological University (NTU), with the\nCollege having been commissioned to develop\nthe curriculum. It is scheduled to admit its inaugural intake of 50 students in 2013, eventually rising to 150 per year, and will be the third\nmedical school in the country.\nProfessor Martyn Partridge, Chair in Respiratory Medicine at Imperial, will be senior vice\ndean of the new school. Speaking about the rationale behind the collaboration, he told Felix:\n\u201cThe Singapore Government came to us for\nhelp with this project because they recognised\nthe quality of our medical course and because\nthey understood that Imperial 15 years ago had\nremarkable similarities with NTU now, being a\ncollege with fine Engineering and Technology\nexpertise but no Faculty of Medicine\u201d.\nThe new partnership will allow more overseas students to be taught by Imperial College, as there is a 7.5% cap on the proportion\nof international students attending UK medical schools, and students at the new institution\nwill be awarded a joint Imperial-NTU degree.\nAdditionally, it is hoped that Imperial students\nwill benefit from the project, via exchange programmes with the new medical school and the\npossibility of spending elective periods in its\nassociated hospitals. There will also be opportunities for staff at Imperial, by means of new\njobs and academic collaborations in Singapore.\nHowever, a Singaporean medical student at\nImperial, who wished to remain anonymous, is\nwary of the partnership.\n\u201cI would still have gone to Imperial College\nLondon [...] because the standard of teaching\nin London (as a whole and within the College itself) is more established and recognised\nworldwide. Imperial College has an international reputation to protect, and I hope that the\nCollege will make every effort to preserve the\nhigh standard of teaching which it has become\nsynonymous with\u201d\nImperial seems to be the ideal candidate for\nthe task of creating a new medical school, given its enviable rankings on both UK and world\nleague tables.\nMedicine at Imperial was ranked 3rd in the\n2011 Good University Guide, and it was ranked\n5th in the world for clinical, pre-clinical and\nhealth in the Times Higher Education World\nUniversity Rankings 2010-11. Furthermore,\nalthough its School of Medicine has only been\naround since 1997, Imperial has had a relatively\nlongstanding involvement in medical training,\ndating back to 1988 when it acquired St Mary\u2019s\nHospital Medical School, itself established in\n1854. However, the results of the most recent\nNational Student Survey suggest that improvement is due - although 91% of students were\noverall satisfied with the Medicine course, only\n58% agreed that they receive sufficient advice\nand support with their studies. Similarly, the\nGeneral Medical Council\u2019s latest Quality Assurance report on the course found that both careers advice and feedback on student progress\nwere \u2018variable\u2019. However, Professor Partridge\nfeels that there have been \u201ctremendous efforts\nmade in the last 18 months to improve students\u2019 perception of how much feedback they\nreceive\u201d, and insists that NTU have chosen the\nright partner.\n\u201cThe Singaporean Government considered\nall of the best Universities when selecting a\nnew partner for Nanyang Technological University and after due diligence they chose Imperial as offering the best course\u201d.\nThe news of Imperial\u2019s expansion brings it up\nto speed with numerous other UK universities,\nincluding Nottingham and UCL, who have already opened campuses abroad.\nHowever, it should be noted that this will\nnot be the first overseas institution with College branding: in 2006, the Imperial College\nLondon Diabetes Centre opened in Abu Dhabi,\nUAE, which was last month awarded JCI (Joint\nCommission International) accreditation in\nclinical care.\nThe Queen\u2019s Tower would be a fine addition to the Singapore skyline, don\u2019t you agree? You don\u2019t? Oh....\nImperial opens Medical\ncampus in Singapore\nReynolds Bar given new lease of\nlife with summer refurbishment\nFriends of Medicin Sans\nFrontieres Freshers\u2019 Social\nFREE FOOD\n10th October. 6:30pm\nReynolds Bar. CX R2/3\nEVENTS\nWhile a lot of attention has been focussed on the\nrefurbishment of Metric and FiveSixEight \u2013 as they\nwill soon be called \u2013 renovations have also been taking place in the Reynolds Bar, the spiritual home of\nICSM in Charing Cross Hospital.\nRedecorating has been much gentler than at the\nUnion, with work consisting mostly of a fresh colour\nscheme, as well as repairing or replacing damaged\nfurniture.\nIn recent years, the Reynolds has been roaring on\nBops and Sports Nights but has been mostly deserted during the day and on quieter evenings. In\norder to remain financially viable, it was felt that this\nworn, gloomy look should be replaced by a more inviting atmosphere where staff and students would\nwant to socialise.\nICSMSU President, David Smith, stated that his\nhope was that the Reynolds feel, \u201cmore inviting,\nmodern, and suitable for relaxing post-lecture or at\nlunchtime, yet still functioning well as a nightclub.\u201d\nThe Reynolds officially reopened last Friday, ahead\nof term, with the \u201cSummer of Love\u201d Bop, hosted by\nthe ICSM Summer Ball Committee.\nRhys Davies\nAli Hosin\nIn brief\nEthos Gym access restricted to\nallow staff some alone-time\nThe Ethos Gym will be closed to students on Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes in a move designed\nto allow staff, who pay for gym membership, easier\naccess to the busy facilities.\nThe gym will be closed to students from 12:00 \u2013 13:30\non Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes and also from\n17:00 \u2013 18:30 on Thursday evenings. To compensate for\nthe restricted availability students will be given free access to Circuit Training from 12:00 to 13:00 on Tuesdays\nand Kondi from 17:15 to 18:00 on Tuedsdays and 12:15\n\u2013 13:00 during Thursday lunchtimes.\nThis is due to staff, who pay a monthly membership\nfee, being frustrated by having to wait to use machines in\na gym that is crowded with spotty-faced youths trying to\nbench-press one another.\nThis situation, which arises from a sports centre that\nis arguably too small to cater for the entire university\n(undergraduates and postgraduates included), will be reviewed in December by Neil Mosley, head of Sports Imperial. Could Alton Towers style Fastrack tickets follow?\nCharles Betts\n\n"

    "content": "26\nFILM\nfelix\nFRIDAY 8 october 2010\nDirector of the much-acclaimed Ian Curtis\nbiopic Control, is back with a bang. Anton\nCorbijn discards the guitar and picks up\nthe rifle in The American, a thriller about\na killer who discovers his soul. Adapted\nfrom British novelist Martin Booth\u2019s A\nVery Private Gentleman (1990), the film\nstars George Clooney as Jack, an assassin-cum-weapons expert hiding in an ancient\nItalian town after a botched attempt on his\nlife. There, he takes on one last job to produce a custom-made rifle for a client of his\nboss and strikes up a few relationships that\nmay ultimately change him, or doom him.\nThe art of suspense is not showing too\nmuch; think of the Coen brothers\u2019 Oscarwinning No Country for Old Men. For a\nfirst endeavor in the thriller genre, Corbijn\ndoes surprisingly well. With sparse music\nthrough the movie and prolonged scenes of\nanticipation, a paranoid atmosphere crackling with tension is created, suitably fitting the story of a hunter being hunted. At\ntimes, the film even felt like a horror flick.\nThe action is quick and concise which, in\nmy opinion, makes the violence more un-settling. Fight scenes are a battle of wits\nrather than a series of extended Mexican\nstandoffs. The American excels due to\nits elegant minimalism which allows the\nweight of the acting and suspense to surface and embed itself in the audience\u2019s\nmind. The backdrop of the scenic Italian\ntown of Castel Del Monte is aptly exploit-ed, and imbues the movie with a hint of\nnoir.\nGeorge Clooney pulls off the character\nof Jack with relative ease. Not surprisingly of course \u2013 his Oscar applauds were\nfrom roles similar to this in Michael Clayton and Syriana. Forgoing his trademark\ncharisma, he transforms into a craggy\nlone wolf struggling for his survival. It\nmarks a departure from the charming or\ncomic characters he played last year. In\nThe American, he is morbid and tense,\neven in the presence of beautiful women;\na stoic demeanor replacing suave wit. Jack\nkills cold-heartedly, without hesitation as\nthe wonderfully-executed opening scene\nshocker proves. Like all movies of this\nkind, the protagonist has a deep-seated\nlonging for the company of another human\nbeing. Bouts of longing sneak out of Jack\nsubtly. Fortunately, this movie does not\ntread down the clich\u00e9d path of redemption.\nIt is more selfish and base, which makes it\nslightly fresh.\nThe plot, though it does not suffer from\nbeing too predictable, is somewhat too\nsimplistic. Perhaps the focal point is intended to be on the character and his de-velopment. A repressed undercurrent of\ninsecurity permeates the film with Jack\u2019s\ndeepening anxiety and relentless vigilance\nand scores the film points for bringing to\nlife an assassin on the run. Corbijn also\ndoes not shy away from gory violence and\nexplicit sexuality, but uses it to intensify\nthe emotional impact of the drama.\nFor a character-centric film, however,\nClooney\u2019s character fails to carry sufficient gravitas to warrant it a must-watch\nfilm. The fault lies not with the acting\nbut in the dramatic arc of the protagonist\nGeorge Clooney:A\nbrooding Bond\nwhich is not refined or complex enough to\ndraw the audience into it. Though it starts\noff well-paced, it becomes rushed towards\nthe end. The antagonist felt a little two-di-mensional, and peppering the relationship\nbetween the antagonist and Jack with a little complexity could be that pinch of spice\nthat makes all the difference between that\ngourmet bolognaise and the off-the-shelf\nmicrowave pasta.\nNevertheless, Corbijn deserves praise for\nthe meticulous attention invested in Jack\nas an arms expert \u2013 weapon aficionados\nwould adore this film. Many scenes depict in fine details the production of that\ncustom-made gun with \u201cthe firing capacity of a sub-machine gun and the range of\na rifle\u201d as demanded by his femme fatale\nclient. You get to marvel at the way Jack\nimprovises parts of the gun with tools\nfound in a car workshop. The movie is part\na study into the intricate art of gun-making\nas we tag along with Maestro Jack.\nThe American is a brooding James Bond.\nIt chooses harsh reality over glamour, drama over grandeur. It is not a tour-de-force\nof Anton Corbijn or George Clooney but\nis, even so, worth watching during one of\nthose Friday nights when you\u2019ve got nothing else substantial to do.\n\u201c\nflick.\nch, in\nin\nre un-un-f wits\nf wits\nxican\nxican\nue to\nue to\nws the\ns the\n\u201d\nthe end.

As well as this, the festival is showcasing several more films before they go on general\nrelease in the UK such as Danny Boyle\u2019s claustrophobic survival story 127 Hours, Mike Leigh\u2019s\nlatest film Another Year, and - fans of Let The\nRight One In should approach with caution - its\nAmerican remake, Let Me In, (it\u2019s actually supposed to be quite good).\nSupporting the BFI\u2019s festival this year is important now more than ever in light of their huge cut\nin funding following the abolishment of the UK\nFilm Council. British film hardly ever gets the international attention that it deserves and money\nis often scarce for small, independent filmmak-ers. As well as supporting British cinema, the\nBFI also shows a wide range of celebrated films\nworld cinema, classic films and shorts.\nClooney takes extreme measures to regain his title of Sexiest Man Alive\nWhat\u2019s On\nDirector Anton Corbijn\nScreenwriter Rowan Joffe\nCast George Clooney, Irina\nBj\u00f6rklund\nThe American\nGuo Heng Chin\nFilms at Imperial\nWhilst the BFI does consistently do decent dis-counts, the prices for tickets to the big events and\npremieres will be pretty expensive for the average\nstudent. Cheaper alternatives, therefore, can be\nfound right here at Imperial (making it ideal for the\npoor and the lazy). For starters there is FilmSocwho are showing a film from a different continent\neach week of this term (starting this Thursday with\nThe Bird People In China), and CinemaSoc - who are\nlaunching a new era of cinema at Imperial (did you\nknow there\u2019s a cinema in the Union) on Tuesday\n26th October with Inception, all for less than a fiver.\nPlug, plug, plug.\nFor a first endeavour\ninto the thriller\ngenre, Corbijn does\nsurprisingy well\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

I\u2019ll\nagree we don\u2019t know exactly what individuals will be doing, but I think we\ncan be confident that we will be able to\ndeliver the full range of teaching. This is\nthe other area of the statement from the\nUnion that worries me the most, the idea\nthat we are closing down Plant Science\u2019s\nWhole Organism teaching. I\u2019ve never\ncontemplated the department carrying\non as before but minus the 28 people i.e.\nno group\u201d\nPlant and Microbial Sciences and Cell\nBiology and Functional Genomics have\nbeen targeted in the restructure due to\ntheir poor research quality and input of\nresearch funding in comparison to other\nunits within the department according to\nthe consultation document issued by the\ndepartment. However their use of data\nhas provoked an outcry from academics\nin the PMS section and the Union. The\nhave vigorously disputed these claims\naccusing the department of distorting\nand misusing the data on research. They\nclaim that the PMS and CBFG sections\nproduce as good research as the other\nunits and that any difference in averages is due to \u201chigh-flying\u201d academics\npulling the average of the group up. The\nHead of the Life Sciences Department\nIan Owens responded by saying that he\ndid not want the restructure to be centred\non a statistical argument and \u201cas Head\nof my department, I would not be presenting the data if I did not believe that\nit was statistically significant.\u201d When\nchallenged by the Union to provide further data he said that he did not want to\n\u201cinsult my academics by telling them\nthat their jobs were dependant on a statistical line in the sand.\u201d\nTo further complicate the issue, the\nsection of Plant and Microbial Sciences\nhas only recently settled at the South\nKensington campus after a highly disruptive 6-year move from the former\ncampus at Wye (and Ian Owens admits\nthat there are still some niggling prob-lems). This has been held up by the opposition to the restructure as evidence\nthat the academics would bring in as\nmuch funding as the other units if they\nhad more time to settle in. But the department contests this saying that there\nhave not been signs of a return to the\n5* Research rating given in 2001 and\nthat some academics also left during the\nWye disruption (possibly hampering the\ngroups research potential).\nIn the name of fairness the Union has\nurged the Department to consider a full\nreview of all units, saying that if difficult decisions have to be made then\nthey should be made in as fair a way\nas possible. The suggestion is unlikely\nto gain much traction with the Department. The Head Ian Owens has spoken\nof his fear of the negative impact on morale of restructures. \u201cThe other units are\nperforming pretty well, and you need a\nwide range of individuals to form a good\nteam and so I don\u2019t want to destroy relationships all the way across the depart-ment. We\u2019ve identified key parameters\nthat you can measure unambiguously,\nresearch citations, and from that we can\nidentify certain trends\u201d\nThe question of whether teaching of\nPlant Sciences will continue in the long\nterm is of course in the air as the Department of Life Sciences are planning a\nreview of teaching.\nIan Owens reiterated his confidence\nin the breadth of teaching options to be\nmade available to students next year.\n\u201cPlant sciences is no different from\nany course next year. They\u2019ll all get\nthrown into the mix as it were, lots of\nstuff will change, lots of stuff will stay\nthe same but there is absolutely no plan\nat all to get rid of plant sciences.\u201d\nUnion President Alex Kendall remains\nsceptical and has been sure to condemn\nthese decisions made by College early\non in the new academic year. He suggested the Department\u2019s priorities may\nbe still misaligned.\n\u201cWhen College improve research,\nthey\u2019ll get more money. But no mat-Head of Department Ian Owens will not \u201cinsult [his] academics by telling them their\njobs [are] dependent on a statistical line in\nthe sand.\u201d\nter how much you improve teaching,\nthere\u2019s no financial correlation.\u201d\nWrite Felix a letter\nabout this issue\nThis story is about a debate\nthat is going on at your university right now. It either affects\nyou directly or it will affect one\nyour friends directly. Be part of\nthis debate, join it and shape\nit.\nWrite a letter (well an email)\nto felix@imperial.ac.uk and\ntell us your thoughts. Is the restructure necessary?

You won\u2019t find\nany undergraduates studying full degrees in\nEnglish Literature, Languages, Law, History or\nany other excuse to spend three years writing\nessays.\nWe\u2019re all here at this \u201ctechnical\u201d university\nto study our very technical subjects. But you\u2019ll\nfind many with an avid interest in non-techni-cal subjects like politics, history or philosophy,\nwho love talking about it, sharing their ideas\nand following recent developments. Around\nSouth Kensington there is still plenty to feed\nyour appetite for intellectual discussion on\nthese issues.\nThere is the PPS (Political Philosophy Society), the newly formed Philosophy Soc, not to\nmention MUN (Model United Nations), History and Debating. Students active in the Conservative and Labour parties have even set up\ntheir own societies, and the numerous religious\nsocieties may delve into some politics in their\nevents at times. Whether it\u2019s weekly discussion\ncircles or just one-off events, these societies are\nat the core of political discussion and debate\nhappening in South Kensington campus.\nFor a more academic route there is a Politics\ncourse offered by the Humanities Department\nfor credit or non-credit, as well as history and\nphilosophy related courses too. And lastly there\nis this, the Politics pages of Felix.\nRead alongside the Business, Arts & Culture\nand other sections, it\u2019s your weekly dose of\nstuff beyond just numbers, equations, chemical reactions, charts and all other features of\nknowledge in the realms of science, engineering and medicine. Because frankly, life is not\nalways about these things, although it may\nseem like it come exam time.\nBeyond Imperial, it is certainly possible to\npursue a career in politics after graduating. In\nBritain, Margaret Thatcher graduated with a\nBSc in Chemistry of all subjects, before becoming known as the Iron Lady for her government\u2019s hard-line conservative policies in the\nCold War era.\nThere is a host of other current government\nleaders who have risen to the top after an initial education in a science or engineering dis-cipline. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of\nIran, studied civil engineering and has a PhD\nfrom Iran University of Science & Technology. Before the Berlin Wall came down Angela Merkel, current German Chancellor, was\nHassan Joudi\nAngela Merkel with ESA astronauts, making use of her degree in Physics\na Physicist. Hu Jintao, President of China, was\ntrained as an engineer at Tsinghua University,\nBeijing - often referred to as China\u2019s MIT \u2013 as\nare many leading individuals in the Chinese\nCommunist Party.\nAsian or \u2018Eastern\u2019 countries tend to have\nmore technocrats, politicians who have come\nfrom a technical background or education, as\nopposed to \u2018Western\u2019 nations whose politicians\ntend to be filled from the ranks of law, business and history graduates. It naturally begs the\nquestion, is there a different style to the way\nthey govern?\nThe stereotype is that people from a technical background may be more rigid in their\nthinking, relying on quantitative data to justify\ntheir arguments or splitting everything into a\nproblem-analysis-solution, but of course none\nof this can completely generalised.\nWhilst holding office, technocrats may place\nmore importance on engineering and industry\nwhen deciding policy. China is an oft-cited\nexample of a nation focussed on science &\ntechnology development, devoting significant\nportions of government spending on R&D\n(Research & Development), and likewise are\nSouth Korea and Japan, for example.\nOr, they are perhaps more reasonable or\ntrusting towards expert advice from scientific\nbodies about their policies. In the UK there is\nsometimes controversy when the government\n\u2018ignores\u2019 advice, such as the case of illegal\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad\nstudied civil engineering\nand has a PhD\ndrugs and Professor David Nutt from Imperial\nCollege in October 2009.\nOn the other hand, technocrats may not necessarily draw heavily on their training as scientists or engineers, and perhaps other factors\ninfluence them more such as the culture of the\norganisations and people around them. After\nall, only a true hardcore reductionist would\nview society as nothing more than one big system with input and output variables to control.\nWe hope the Politics section of Felix can be a\ngreat forum for discussion and debate on political issues of all kinds. To use a cliche, Felix is\nby students for students, so your contributions\ncan be sent anytime to politics.felix@imperial.\nac.uk. From there, the editorial team will lay it\nout and get it published for you.\nOnly with contributions from students like\nyou, who are interested enough to read to the\nend of this article, can this section be successful.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Kenneth Lee\nNepal has failed for the 10th time to\nelect a Prime Minister, rivalling Belgium and Iraq in\nits inability to form a government.\nNepal has been leaderless since former Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal resigned on 30 June\n2010. Ram Chandra Poudel from the Nepali Congress party was the only candidate to run for the\npost in the most recent attempt to elect a new\nPrime Minister.

The state\nof emergency was initially declared last Thursday,\nafter a police revolt which saw President Correa\nphysically attacked by the police and left several\nothers dead in clashes between the police and the\nmilitary. The revolt was prompted by a new law which\ncuts public sector benefits.\nThe emergency decree allows the military to be in\ncharge of securing the country instead of the police\nand has been denounced by opposition members\nwho claim that the revolt was planned by President\nCorrea in order to hide extreme corruption and pov-erty.

At times, it was definitely Hugh who was leading this wandering group of foreigners, or gaijin as\nwe were referred to in the streets!\nOur first two games in Tokyo were\nboth at the Tokyo University Komaba\ncampus; the first fixture was against Yokohama Country and Athletic Club - an\nex-pat team - for the 2nd XV, whilst the\n1st XV played Tokyo University, who\nit turns out had spoken to Kyoto and\nbrought in some alumni players from\nthe last decade to bolster their side. This\nwas not going to be a good day\nfor Ninja\u2019s, as ill-discipline and lack\nof composure set in, with three yellow\ncards being brandished for the game\nagainst Tokyo, the first of which was for\nthe Tokyo flanker straight after the kick-off. The Barbarians had a rare luxury\nfor their game, an English referee who\nplayed Northern Hemisphere rugby.\nThis meant that scrums were straight\nand rapid for a change! After a shaky\nstart, which saw Richard \u2018Chumble\u2019 Simons summersault after jumping into a\ntackle, the Barbarians found their feet\nand put together some good phases,\nhowever, their fitness gave way and Yokohama went on to win the game.\nThree days later, the 2nd XV had their\nlast game of tour against Kokushikan\nUniversity, however, despite their best\nefforts, were unable to win the game, but\nwere able to come away with some\nexcellent presents.\nWhilst in Tokyo, the Club made a trip\nto Mount Fuji, determined to reach the\nsummit and make it back to the hostel\nall in one day. After several warnings\nfrom locals about the cold and altitude\nsickness, the touring party set off on\nthe eight hour climb, but as the hours\nwent on, the numbers climbing began\nto dwindle and in the end, only a few\nmade it to the summit. One of the touring party members even managed to\nreach the summit and make it back to\nthe bus station in five hours, a remarkable achievement!\nAfter spending a week in Tokyo, the\ntouring party made its way to the final\ndestination of Osaka, where the 1st XV\nwould play Osaka Uni- versity\no f\nHealth and Sports Science. The game\nwas very tough and demanding on the\nplayers, and at half time, Imperial were\nnarrowly losing 14-5, however, their\nsuperior fitness showed and Osaka\nwent on to win the game 61-5. After the\ngame, we were yet again blown away\nwith the Japanese hospitality, not only\nwere we given a commemorative t-shirt\neach, but they also presented the Club\nwith a Samurai helmet, a present that\nwill definitely have to reside behind a\nglass cabinet! If that was not enough,\nthey also organised a mesmerizing Japanese Drum performance, where we were\neven allowed a go to create our\nown beat, how- ever, it\ndefinitely lacked\nany sort of tune!\nThe tour was exciting, it was exhilarating and it was exhausting, but it was\nan experience that the players will never\nforget, and it would not have been possible without the generous support from\nSport Imperial and the Old Centralians\u2019\nTrust.\nA big\nthank you\nto you all.\nOh, and one\nmore thing,\nI motherfucking\nheart the JPan!*\n\n"

Your favourite\nsports night style staple and go-to firms-wear has found itself on the hottest catwalks of London, Paris, Milan and New\nYork: yes, chinos are actually in vogue.\nAdmittedly, the modest chino is\nsomewhat underrated; it is the male\nequivalent of the trusty black pencil\nskirt: smart, easy to wear and to co-ordinate. Only their very beige-ness\n(both in colour and level of sartorial\ncaptivation) makes them blur into obscurity \u2013 you, in your chinos and blue\nshirt, look exactly the same as your\nfirm buddy who is wearing ostensibly\nthe same thing. So how to make them\nlook new and interesting, whilst still\nkeeping them smart enough not to earn\na sneer from your cantankerous old\nMary\u2019s consultant? Take a leaf out of\nJames Dean\u2019s book, who immortalised\nthe classic cool of the chino in East of\nEden (right).\nFirst, step out of the comfort zone of the\ncrisp blue shirt, and pull on a (gasp!)\nsmall-collared shirt, in a wide navy\ngingham perhaps. Then, take a crew\nneck jumper, wonderfully cosy for win-ter, in either a chunkier cable or a finer\ngauge knit depending on your build, in\na warm maroon or grey. For the pi\u00e8ce\nde r\u00e9sistance, a pair of brown brogues:\nclassic, timeless \u2013 a man\u2019s staple. The\nlook is preppy American cool \u2013 Don\nDraper on a casual Friday at the office:\na little outdoorsy yet traditional.

An independent boutique-slash-gallery showcasing the very best handpicked new\ntalent of the fashion world, Machine-A is a veritable\ntreasure trove for unique pieces to revitalise the\nmost dreary of wardrobes. The price point is mid-to-high range, but definitely not up there with your\ntop-end designers - the idea here is to pick up something you didn\u2019t know was missing from your closet,\nsomething beautifully made which injects a little joy,\nsome avant-garde whimsy into your everyday style.\nFor example, if you lusted after the S&M studded\nAlice Palmer leggings that strutted the runway at\nVauxhall Fashion Scout last season, but had no idea\nwhere to find a stockist of such a young and fresh\ntalent \u2013 this is that spot, a hotpot of one-offs and\nuncompromisingly innovative designs.

Kate\nMoss by Mario Testino, printed in\nextremely limited edition and retailing at about \u00a3600, has become\nan object of lust for fashionistas\neverywhere. Not only does it contain\nsome of the most iconic work of a creative genius, but it also gives a glimpse\ninto the world of the inimitable Kate\nMoss, from her early days backstage\nat her first runway shows to her revolutionary editorials, plus intimate private\nshots between the two extraordinarily\nclose friends.\nSays Testino of Moss: \u201cI met Kate\nvery early on. Shortly after her first\nGalliano show I went backstage to congratulate her, only to find her crying:\nshe was disappointed that she had only\nbeen given one outfit to model in the\nshow. My answer to her was this: \u2018In\nlife there are perfumes and colognes.\nYou need to use lots of cologne as the\nscent fades away; with a perfume you\njust use a drop and it lasts all night.\nYou are a perfume, you will go on and\non.\u2019 Little did I know just how true that\nwould become! And that I had made a\nfriend for life.\u201d\nThis book is an tribute by one icon of\nthe fashion world to another: if only my\nstudent loan would allow, a copy would\ntake pride of place on my coffee table!\nGabriella Yongue\nJames Dean likes his chinos like he likes his women: leaning against a post, looking pretty\n\n"

Fencing\nepee for Wales, former Imperial Club President,\nEmily Bottle, came in a respectable 23rd despite\nhaving spent most of the year battling injuries,\nmaking her the best Welsh epeeist. She did well\nenough in her poule that she didn\u2019t have to fence\nthe first round of direct elimination, but was\nknocked out in the next round, with a 15/7 score\nline, by English fencer Mary Cohen who ended\nplaced 7th.\nThere have been some impressive sabre victories for Imperial fencers. Henry Gann and\nMaiyuran Ratneswaran were both selected for\nthe English side, and have been putting in some\nexcellent results. Henry was overall placed 27th\nhaving, as Emily, done well enough in his pool\nthat he missed the first direct elimination round,\nonly to be knocked out in the next round, with a\n15/13 score line, by fellow English team member\nGildas Braine, who finished in 7th place.\nMaiyuran had an excellent competition, leaving a trail of impressive fencers in his wake, winning every match in his pool, and then setting\nimpressively one-sided scores in all of the direct\nelimination matches, 15/6, 15/7, 15/10, 15/7. In\nthe final he faced off against team mate Anthony\nCrutchett, losing by only one hit, 15/14, to gain\na silver medal.\nIn the team sabre event, the English team faced\noff against India first, having not had to fight the\nfirst round by having the highest seeding. The\nteam smashed India 45/27, meaning that all they\nhad to do was beat Australia, who had been putting up almost as impressive scores, to be Commonwealth champions.\nIn the end it wasn\u2019t even close, with the English\nteam winning 45/36, securing a gold medal for\nboth of Imperial\u2019s fencers. Congratulations to all\nour fencers, who have done spectacularly at this\nevent!\n\n"

And of all the people\nwriting for Felix, I should definitely not be\nthe one trying to sell it as the esteemed and\ncherished student newspaper it so wants to\nbe. But I\u2019m still going to do it.\nFirstly let\u2019s give a brief overview of our new\nEditor-in-chief, Kadhim Shubber. Well, that\u2019s\nenough about our Editor-in-Chief, so onto the\nfront page. This is here to remind you that Imperial\nCollege has a union and that it fucks everything\nup, whilst remaining agonisingly boring. Not to\nworry though, if the uninspired headline fails to\ndraw your attention, there\u2019s a column of mundane,\nand frankly desperate, pull-quotes sitting next to a\nphoto of a sabbatical holding a small wad of cash\nand looking anxious \u2013 because they\u2019ve presumably\nfucked everything up and it\u2019s something to do with\nmoney.\nIf you\u2019re stupid enough to have opened up the\nnewspaper, you will probably see a picture of the\nEditor-in-chief, Kadhim Shubber. I really don\u2019t\nthink I need to say anything more about him, so\nlet\u2019s just move on. Oh bloody hell, there\u2019s a whole\ndouble-page spread dedicated solely to the aforementioned headline story. Small font, long words,\nsomething about the rector \u2013 turn the page. Make\nsure you do it fast and loud, whilst shaking your\nhead and tutting. It\u2019s not a real newspaper, but you\ncan at least read it like one.\nWith a good deal of histrionic page-turning, you\nshould swiftly reach the comment section having\nonly read one word \u2013 Kadhim. The comment section is now an established religion. You have the\nvenerated Gilead Amit, God of knowledge and\nlanguage; the misanthropic acrimonious prince of\ndarkness, Angry Geek; and then that crazy bearded\nnaked guy in the street screaming at passers-by\nto repent their sins, whilst pissing on them; Rhys\nDavies. Unfortunately the religion also comes with\nits fair share of irritating preachers, or born-again\ncommentians, who are under the delusion that people actually read their pieces. Comment is Free,\nbut your opinions are shit, so don\u2019t bother.\nNow you have the arduous task of sifting\nthrough pages of more inflated opinion, but in specific fields of interest. World news - as long as it\ndoesn\u2019t affect me, I don\u2019t care; Science \u2013 I got my\nplace at Imperial so I don\u2019t need to pretend to have\nan extra-curricular interest in science anymore;\nPolitics \u2013 We have a deficit. This annoys people.\nOh, you can apparently write that with a lot more\nwords; Music \u2013 gig reviews of bands I\u2019ve never\nheard of and certainly won\u2019t listen to \u2013 skip; Film\n\u2013 out with the old pretentious critic and in with the\nnew \u2013 oh, a pretentious film critic - skip; CENTREFOLD \u2013 THAT is our netball team!? Are you\nserious? I thought pseudo-sports were invented for\nthe sole purpose of endorsing slutty attire and a\npurely aesthetic-based recruiting system. Oh this is\njust a shocking reminder that the human body can\ntruly be a hideous thing, skip, skip, skip \u2013 finally!\nThe puzzles!\nNothing makes me more uncomfortable than\nwatching Imperial students doing puzzles. It\u2019s\ntheir eyes, the intensity; the intimacy. It\u2019s like they\nsee numbers on a grid, and want to fuck it. Harmless puzzles quickly evolve into sordid sex games.\n\u2018What if I put my number eight there? Do you like\nthat baby? You want a three here? Well if you like\nit filthy then why don\u2019t I stick my number four in\n\u2013 oh shit! I\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realise there was already a four in this column. Yeah, I know where to\nput it ok!? This isn\u2019t my first time! I\u2019ve just never\ndone this with such a sexy Sudoku before.\u2019\nYeah I tend to stay away from the puzzles, and the\npeople that do the puzzles. And pretty much everyone does the puzzles, so what does that say about\nme?

By Dylan Lowe\nL\naura pretty much determined,\npackaged and set me up with the\nSaturday\u2019s itinerary. She takes\ncredit for being among the first\nto publicise the Jermyn Street\nGarden Party, which led to queues of palatal\ndelights and musing as to whether I can pull\noff tweeds. She also penned a blog post about\nthe Morris dancing festival in Southbank \u2013 we\nended up making an impromptu attendance at\nthe premiere of Way of the Morris.\nSo much for I being the one who sent out the\ninvitation for an interview for Felix.\nIn the SMS, the description of her attire:\n\u201cwearing a dress and boots, look like a wartime\nland lady\u201d; how befitting that was when I found\nher outside of Waterstone\u2019s, intent on a reading\nof Matilda. But there were those beyond plain\nclothing that helped me identify Laura: the way\nher fearlessness shone through her chuckle as\nshe chatted up a couple of strangers, the way\nshe emanated her aura-like exuberance.\nNo exaggeration, that: at least it was how my\nexpectations portrayed one of the most prominent bloggers in London travel.\nLaura Porter runs the About.com London\ntravel guide, delivering news of London\u2019s latest and finest entertainment options to visitors\nand locals alike since 2006. The website also\noffers an extensive databank of information,\nrecommendations and free-things-to-do lists \u2013\nno doubt the result of her continued dedication\n\u2013 which are instrumental in inspiring many of\nmy excursions around the city I\u2019m still so ignorant of, yet undeniably infatuated with.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of London \u2013 it has something\nfor everyone\u201d\nWhile many people have not much love lost\nfor their jobs, or the subjects of their occupational concerns, Laura\u2019s affection for London\nand travel is unquestionable.\nAnd it all began during her band-chasing\ndays, which took her across the United States\nas a youngster. A regular visitor of London herself \u2013 having lived in Essex through her teenage\nyears \u2013 with a brother residing in the capital,\nher familiarity with the city didn\u2019t necessarily\ntranslate to passion. Upon returning from the\nStates, however, and newly reformed by experiences as a seasoned traveller, her perception\nof London changed.\nLaura sipped her tea, shot me with an evocative grin, before summing up the turning point\nof her life.\n\u201cBasically I landed in London, got myself a\nflat, did my laundry, all within 24 hours!\u201d\nHer streak of serendipity didn\u2019t end there.\nWhen maternity leave brought her teaching job\n\u2013 tutoring foreign students English \u2013 to a hiatus she found herself left with too much time\nto spare. Introduced to About.com by a friend,\nwho runs the painting guide, she became aware\nof the vacant position of London travel editor\nand, encouraged by her experience as a freelance writer, bid for the job. A harsh selection\nprocess later she came out on top.\nAccording to Laura, running the blog at its\nearly stages wasn\u2019t all money and glamour \u2013\nafter all, it took over a year before the build-up\nof content and internet traffic was sufficient to\nearn her a sizeable income and the opportunity\nto go full-time. And a huge part of her resilience has to be attributed to her continued fascination for her subject of choice.\nWhat I could relate to her excited tone, glimmer in her eyes whenever London is men-tioned, is a sense of adventure. Indeed, living\nin London can be an adventure in itself \u2013 depending on your attitude.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in London more than half my life,\nand I was only a short distance outside before,\nand I can still find a new street in London that\nI\u2019ve never walked down, every day of my life.\nHow cool is that?\u201d\nHow do you keep yourself up to date with\nwhat\u2019s happening in London, I asked. As a true\nblogger she stressed the importance of social\nmedia \u2013 after all, it was through twitter that\nthe pair of us met and arranged to meet up in\nreal life. She also suggested reading online\nresources such as the Londonist, which is free\nand regularly updated.\nFor a substantial number of Imperial students\narriving to live in London for the first time in\ntheir lives \u2013 many of whom foreign students\nwho have never stepped foot on English soil \u2013\nunfamiliarity of the capital city is often what\ndaunted those fresh faces that traverse the cam-pus. In fact, I was one of them. I asked Laura\nfor any advice on how to make the most out of\nLondon.\n\u201cShe imparted her wisdom in two memorable\nwords: be spontaneous\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of London \u2013 it has something for everyone. I love the fact I can visit a\nscience museum in the morning, watch opera\nin the afternoon, and comedy in the evening.\nWhile sampling food from every country in the\nworld.\n\u201cAnd London has so much going on for free\nthat no one seems to hear about. Have you been\nto the Cigar Museum or the Twining\u2019s Tea Museum, or seen the over-stuffed walrus at Horniman Museum? Have you seen the pelicans\nbeing fed in St James\u2019s Park, or admired the\ndeer in Richmond Park? A walk on Hampstead\nHeath makes you feel you are no longer in London until you come down the hill and find a\ngreat cafe or pub.\u201d\nNeeding to escape from academic studies and student hall life? Want to explore\nLondon and find its hidden gems but don\u2019t\nknow where to start? Log on to Laura\u2019s blog\n(golondon.about.com) or follow her on twitter @AboutLondon.\nWho: Art of Backpacking is run by the dynamic duo\nof avid travellers Michael Tieso and Teresa Gotay.\nAbout: Backpacking, they say, is not only a way\nto travel \u2013 it\u2019s also a lifestyle. They hope to show\ntheir readers the wonders of travel \u2013 culture, food,\nnature, kindness \u2013 and encourage people to take\nthe leap of faith of quitting their daily routines and\ngo travelling.\nWhy: These guys offer solid advice not only on\nbudget travelling, but also dealing with different\nissues of travel.

Experimentally manipulating the\nabilities of one man and a guitar to form wonderfully edgy riffs that weave their way, dissonantly,\naround the powerful lyrics, Young comes across as\nthe emotionally dedicated activist he is. The album\nis very much a quiet affair despite the anger-fuelled,\nfeedback-drenched guitaring that takes you by sur-prise. Young keeps it solitary, like listening to a man\nletting go of his inner torment. There is no feeling\nof forced production and the stripped back manner\nkeeps the music fresh every time I listen to it. It is\nproduced by mastermind Daniel Lanois, who brings\nout the addictive effects but toys with repetition.\nOverall, this is a wonderfully intimate piece of work\nthat brings you one-on-one with Neil Young.\n- Luke Turner\nMost listened to\nthis week by\nFelix Music\nmembers on\nlast.fm\n1.

Only joking\nwe weren\u2019t. We got to a stage where we had\nwritten god knows how many songs, and we\nthought we ought to get a name.

We have a song\ncalled \u2018Tell Suburbia\u2019, which is about 9-10\nminutes long, it\u2019s epic, and we\u2019ve always\nthought Maxi Jazz would just be perfect.\nI\u2019d love to see Noel Gallagher up on stage\nplaying guitar with us, which would be pretty mental, just because we have that mix of\nstyles within what we do and we both have\nKey info\nTop song: \u2018Dead Famous\u2019.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\nFriday 08 October 2010\n14\nBusiness Editors: Sina Atherian\nAfonso Campos\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBeing at one of the world\u2019s top universities has its perks when it comes to getting employed. You are lucky enough\nthat companies actively want to give\nyou the chance to shine through a summer internship which could hopefully\nlead to the holy grail; the offer of a full-time job after your graduation. The opportunity to do well is yours to throw\naway. The internship does not need to\nbe the seven-headed monster that it is\nsometimes made out to be.\nIf you take the time to understand\nwhat a summer internship is, the chances are that you will be able navigate the\nmaze of applications and interviews\nmuch better than someone who thinks it\nis just something you do at the end of\nyour penultimate year of university because of the zeitgeist.\nThis article chiefly aims to get you\nthinking along the right tracks, and is\nnot necessarily heavy on practical advice as the information you are able to\nfind online will be far superior to anything we could condense into this paper.\nBeing in the right frame of mind to\nthink about internships in the right manner means that what you really need to\ndo is become familiar with what an internship is at its very core, what it means\nfor the company and what it means for\nyou. This is absolutely paramount and\nsomething most students tend to over-look.\nLet\u2019s begin by thinking about what the\ninternship means for a company. Some\nfirms take on hundreds of interns every summer, paying each of them up to\n\u00a31,000 a week for a period of roughly\ntwo months. It does not take much arithmetic genius to figure out that this can\neasily add up to millions of pounds over\nthe summer, not even taking into account\nthe the salaries paid to the usually very\nefficient campus recruitment teams that\nspend literally thousands of man-hours\ntrying to find you. First and foremost\nthen, the internship is a talent seeking\nexercise on the company\u2019s part and an\ninvestment to find the best people they\ncan. It also gives firms a very long time\nto make a decision of whether or not to\nemploy a candidate full-time without\nhaving to rely exclusively on rushed in-terviews. If you understand this and the\ncompany\u2019s motivation, you are halfway\ntowards being a fantastic applicant.\nFor yourself the internship is an unmissable chance to find out for real what\nit\u2019s like to, a) work at the firm from\nwhich you have received and accepted\nan offer, and b) work in the industry you\nhave chosen.\nIf you think you will find out about\nthe work itself by adding an immense\namount of value in the work you do,\nor creating revolutionary solutions to\nthe firm\u2019s problems, you may be in for\nsomewhat of a disappointment. While\nthe work you will be doing can often be\ninteresting, it is likely that it will not be\nas challenging or important as the tasks\nbeing carried out by full-time employ-ees. This can be for regulatory and legal\nreasons, or simply because you do not\nyet have the knowledge required. The\nmain idea for you therefore, is to find\nout as much as possible about the real\nBagging the elephant internship is not all about ticking the right boxes; the right way of thinking goes a long way\n\u201cRemember: be personable, be\nhungry, be intelligent and be\nhumble\u201d\nThe summer\nbegins right now\nIf you are looking for an internship for next summer, it\npays to start thinking about it as early as possible\nAfonso Campos\nRead this article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nSummer internship tips\nPsychometric tests\nThese tests are many times the gatekeepers of\nthe recruitment system. If you do not perform well\nin them, you are out. The numerical test seems to\nput even the most mathematically able students in a\nsomewhat uncomfortable position.\nThe mathematics is basic, usually at GCSE level or\nbelow, but the time constraints throw many people\noff. With usually less than 1 minute per question, the\ntrick is not to spend very long on any one problem.\nApplications\nCompanies sometimes get over two hundred applications per place. With this kind of competition they\nare almost looking for reasons to put your CV in the\nbin. Do not give them any excuse to do that.\nYou do this by ensuring that your spelling and grammar are perfect and that you tailor your application\nto the individual company. Make sure that you reference company specifics whenever possible and\navoid generic answers and cover letters.\nAnother oftentimes overlooked tactic is timing. Unless a company specifies that they do not look at\napplications until after the deadline, chances are\nthat they are looked at on a rolling basis, so apply\nas soon as you are able to have a solid application.\nDO NOT apply close to the deadline if you can at all\navoid it.\nInterviews\nThere are two different kinds of questions you will be\nasked at interview; competency and technical.\nCompetency questions, as the word suggests, look\nfor evidence that you have the skills the job requires\nyou to have. These include teamwork, leadership, or-ganisation, confidence, etc...\nMake sure that you support all your answers with\nanecdotal evidence.\nThe technical questions are more job specific and\nreally require you to brush up on some of the details\nof the job you are applying for. For internships, these\ndo not tend to be too in depth and the focus is on\ncultural fit and competencies.\nOnline resources\nwww.efinancialcareers.co.uk \u2013 Lots of advice from\nvarious professional sources as well as practice numerical tests.\nwww.milkround.com \u2013 One of the most comprehensive lists of internships and graduate jobs online.\nwww.wikijob.co.uk \u2013 Forums full of first hand information from job seekers and more practice numerical tests.\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX\nFriday 08 October 2010\n30\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFor the first of our \u2018sequels to recently released\ngames\u2019 theme, Fallout: New Vegas was on\nshow this year at Eurogamer just weeks before\nit comes out in the shops. Although not a direct\nsequel to last year\u2019s smash hit Fallout 3, as the\ngame takes place in an entirely new location\nand with new characters, fans will recognise\nthe familiar Bethesda engine and game inter-face.\nThe plot begins in the \u2018Mojave Wasteland\u2019,\nsimilar in size to the \u2018Capitol Wasteland\u2019 only\nnow located in Nevada, with a courier for the\nMojave Express. Whilst delivering a package\nthe faceless, nameless protagonist is shot in the\nhead and left to die in a hole, only to be rescued\nby a robot and taken to a doctor to be patched\nup. From here we arrive at the usual character\ncreation screen and are shortly booted out into\nthe world to unravel the mystery of the attempted assassination.\nFirst impressions of the game come with a\nbig wash of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as the core gameplay and\nstyle remain very similar to Fallout 3. V.A.T.S.\nis still very much present, karma is still a part\nof gameplay and the inventory, perks and stats\nsystem all still work the same way. The similarities don\u2019t stop there either, because although\nthe Wasteland has been given a bit more brightness and colour and a bit of visual makeup, the\nstyle is pretty much the same stuff we\u2019ve seen\nbefore. Same blasted concrete and same murky\nskies, and in fact it\u2019s all running on the same\nengine. Fundamentally, in the time we spent\nwalking around the wasteland shooting bandits and raiders, Fallout: New Vegas did little\nto convince us that it was anything more than\na new story for a game we\u2019ve played before.\nThere have been some changes and improvements in the form of a new \u201cinfamy\u201d system,\nthat tracks the players notoriety with different\nfactions. In a similar way to karma, this factor\naffects how different factions within the world\nwill respond to you. Players also have the opportunity to permanently modify weapons\nwith scopes, silencers and other nice things. A\nnew \u2018companion wheel\u2019 also features, making\nit much easier to control companions without\nhaving to go through endless dialog, and all\nweapons can now be aimed with a physical\ncrosshair.\n\u2018Hardcore mode\u2019 is also the title of a new\ngameplay mode that aims to bring a fresh challenge to players. Although we didn\u2019t get to play\nit ourselves, a Bethesda minion filled us in on\nthe details: hardcore mode does exactly what it\nsays on the tin, making the game harder by giving stimpaks a time lag, adding sleep and water\ndeprivation effects and causing ammo to have\nweight. It certainly does sound like it provides\na new way of thinking for experienced gamers,\nbut although the Bethesda minion insisted that\n\u201cit\u2019s an entirely new way of playing the game,\u201d\nwe remain unconvinced that the core Fallout\ngameplay will be changed drastically.\nIf you played through Fallout 3 and still can\u2019t\nget enough, or have never played anything\nlike it at all, you should get New Vegas. It\u2019s\nthe standard Fallout gameplay we saw last year\nwith a few tweaks and improvements, and if\nthat\u2019s what you like then that\u2019s fine. If, like us,\nyou were a little bit bored by the end of the last\ngame and were hoping for something new and\ndifferent, then New Vegas might not be the best\nchoice.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed:\nBrotherhood\nFallout: New Vegas\nSequels aplenty at\nEurogamer Expo\nSimon\nWorthington\nblagged entry to\nthis year\u2019s event\nat Earls Court and\ngot a chance to\npreview some of\nthe titles that are\ncoming our way\nthis year and next\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless specifically mentioned\nto the contary you\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash\nPlayer plug-in which can be installed from http://get.\nadobe.com/flashplayer/.\nNanaca Crash\ntinyurl.com/nanaca\nThe first thing you should know about this game is\nthat it\u2019s Japanese, which therefore means it\u2019s been\nliberally sprinkled with craziness. In this anime-style\ngame you control a girl on a bike whose main objective is to crash into a man, sending him flying,\nand then to keep him in the air as long as possible\nthrough a series of further carefully-timed aerial col-lisions. Quite what the story is here is a mystery, as\nall the instructions are also in Japanese.\nSo far, so easy, but the skill is really required when\nyou notice the passers-by on the ground below, on\nwhich the flying man will occasionally bounce. Some\nwill slow you down and some will speed you up, so\nit\u2019s a constant battle to use crashes in the right place\nto get boosts and avoid the girl that ends the game\nearly. There\u2019s also immense satisfaction to be had\nfrom landing \u2018specials\u2019, where an ordinary boost will\nturn into a super crazy anime explosion. Addiction\nis not a word to be used lightly but once you\u2019ve got\ninto the game all that matters is beating the previous\ndistance record. Ours was over 10km by the way so if\nyou beat that then let us know!\nAlthough they were authored at the turn of the mille-nium, relatively few people seem to have encounted\nthis ever-growing series of games. All involve the titular yeti using clubs, snowballs or even flamingos to\nhit penguins as fast as he can along beaches and up\nicebergs. Our personal favourite is Yetisports 4: Albatross Overload, although make sure to try the original\npenguin-hitting classic. Penguin fans can also sleep\neasy as all of the fluffy critters seem to be fine upon\nlanding. Experts should try the Ylympics Tournament!\nYou could be forgiven for feeling a peculiar\ntwitch of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu upon hearing that the next\ntitle to come at us from Ubisoft Montreal is\nyet another Assassin\u2019s Creed title, Assassin\u2019s\nCreed: Brotherhood. It hasn\u2019t even been a full\nyear since its predecessor Assassin\u2019s Creed\nYeti Sports\nyetisports.org\n\n"

The rest of the top ten was populated\nby American institutions. When calculating the rank-ings, QS placed a lot of weight on the strength of\na university\u2019s reputation, as well as other factors\nsuch as staff/student ratio, employability and inter-nationality.\nHowever, the rankings released by Times Higher\nEducation make for less favourable reading. While\nCambridge and Oxford still score higher, in joint 6th\nplace, the top ten are dominated by American universities such as Harvard and MIT. Imperial sneaks\nin at 9th place. UCL is the next highest ranked UK\nuniversity at 22nd. THE has a different focus to QS,\nplacing more weight on a university\u2019s research influence and the quality of its teaching.\nThis is the first year that QS and THE have produced different league tables; previously, they had\ncompiled their rankings together. In 2009, they put\nImperial at 5th in the world, joint with Oxford.\nWhile we must be careful not to read too much into\nthese statistics, some thoughts can be drawn from\nthem. According to QS, we go to a university that\nis still worth bragging about but the lower ranking\nby THE reflects the fact that we shouldn\u2019t trade on\nreputation alone.\nEven though both league tables put Imperial lower\nthan in previous years, it is still a world-class in-stitution. However, it will be interesting to see how\nit performs in future rankings, especially at a time\nwhen higher education funding and budgets are in\njeopardy of being cut.\nRhys Davies\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nan online statement, which also accused\nthe panel reviewing the restructure of a\nconflict of interest \u2013 a claim the department rigorously denies.\nHead of the Life Sciences Department\nIan Owens rebutted the accusations.\n\u201cWe are absolutely not closing down\nPlant Sciences, we\u2019re restructuring that\ngroup because that group has some difficulties and instead we\u2019re putting something else in its place.\u201d He sought to reassure undergraduates in his department\nin a recent email that said \u201cImperial\u2019s\ncommitment to key fields of academic\nactivity remains as strong as before\u201d. He\nalso pointed to plans to create a cross-departmental unit of Plant Sciences\nthat would work across disciplines to\nencourage research in Plant Sciences, a\nplan that the Union called \u2018vacuous\u2019. He\nadmitted that no concrete plans for the\ncross-departmental unit could be made\nuntil the restructure had been completed.\nFurther concerns have been raised\nabout the impact that the loss of academics from the PMS and CBFG sections\nwould have on undergraduate teaching.\nWhile at this stage of the restructure it\nis unknown how many staff will keep or\nlose their positions, the loss of staff, that\naccording to the Union takes on the majority of the teaching and administrative\nwork in the department, would be detrimental to teaching.\nThe Union President Alex Kendall argued that it was clear from teaching data\nthat the Plant Science and Cell Biology\nacademics do the bulk of the teaching in\nthe Life Sciences Department, in some\ncases 50% more than academics from\nother sections. Ian Owens disputed this\nanalysis pointing out that it did not include post-graduate teaching hours\nwhich reduced the discrepancy and further said that \u201cthe teaching and administrative activities of the two centres did\nnot satisfactorily counterbalance their\nrelatively low research competitiveness.\u201d\nThe trigger of the restructure is the department\u2019s precarious financial position.\nIt has been chipping away at a \u00a312 million operating deficit since 2006/2007\nand had reduced the gap to around\n\u00a3750,000 as of last year. However the\nremoval of parts of College funding (the\nso-called flexibility margin) has undone\nsome of the department\u2019s hard work. The\nCollege said this about the removal of\nthe flexibility margin: \u201cThe \u2018Flexibility\nContinued from front page\nMargin\u2019 is designed to act as a buffer,\nprotecting faculties from fluctuations in\nresource. It is not intended to provide\nongoing support; if it were so then this\nwould be at the expense of other academic areas of the College.\u201d\nThe jobs of 28 academics are at risk\nin the restructure, which is designed to\nplug \u00a31 million of the \u00a31.5 million gap\n(the other \u00a30.5 million coming from\nfurther cost-saving measures). The department has already taken significant\nsteps to address their financial issues,\nwhich originate from the re-structure\nof the then Faculty of Life Sciences in\n2004/2005. These steps include increasing the number of undergraduates to the\nmaximum allowed, increasing fees for\npost-graduates and overseas students\nand down-sizing the amount of space\nused by the Department.\nThe Union President has taken a controversial position on the department\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties, saying that the\nrestructure is an \u201ceasy way out\u201d of the\ndepartment\u2019s financial situation and further declaring on his Union blog that\nthe College \u201chas money to burn\u201d. He\nquestioned the Department\u2019s motives\nsaying that the re-structure sent the\nmessage to academics that \u201cif you are\nan excellent teacher but not an \u2018internationally competitive\u2019 researcher you\nhave no reason to be here.\u201d However\nIan Owens brushed away the notion that\nhe was rejecting individuals \u201cI\u2019m look-\n"

Hello and welcome! I think this is\nthe special time of the year when I can safely\nassume that alcohol replaces food entirely in\nterms of calorie intake.\nAs Welcome Week comes to an end though,\nthe test for survival for many begins. Students\nare stereotyped into this savage animal unable\nto boil an egg, buying 50p Sainsbury\u2019s Basics\npizzas and spending all their loans on drink.\nIt\u2019s not a stereotype. It\u2019s probably true. A lot of\nstudents in their first year, including me, were\nfaced with the reality of being left alone to our\n(lack of) culinary skills and a decision to either\nembrace our inner Delia or rot with starvation.\nActually, there was also the option of heading\ndown to any restaurant within a 2 mile radius\nand pay to be fed in swanky South Kensington. Nice for a while, until the student loan runs\npainfully dry. The fact is though, you\u2019ll learn to\ncook. These tips will help make it a smoother\nprocess:\n1. Don\u2019t buy your groceries from Whole\nFoods. Okay maybe just once or twice, but definitely not all the time. Boasting to be the biggest retailer of natural and organic foods, you\ncan find freshly ground peanut butter, a cheese\ncellar and a grocery section that stocks over a\ndozen types of tomatoes. Did you even know\nthat that many existed? Hell no. There\u2019s even a\ndedicated trolley escalator. Definitely warrants\na visit to ogle at the marvelous selection of\nfoods you didn\u2019t even know existed, however\nI would not recommend a shopping spree here\nunless you\u2019re cooking for the Queen.\n2. Learn from the experts. Delia Smith, Nigella Lawson, Jamie Oliver. We all love them for\na reason. Delia even teaches you how to boil\nan egg! Patronizing, I know. All at the click of\na mouse too! I mean touch pad - considering\nwe\u2019re all students and decked out with shiny\nnew laptops. Just make sure the laptop doesn\u2019t\nget food spilled onto it. Before you know it,\nthe laptop you anticipated on using for the next\nfour years has lasted you a grand four days.\n3. Cook dinner with friends. It\u2019s great if you\ncan find a budding chef in your midst, maybe\nyou can sponge a meal or two from them.

When the can explodes\nMalaysia Kitchen\u2019s unexpected hellish\nnightmare on Trafalgar Square\nLast month, Trafalgar Square became home\nto the biggest crowd of Malaysians I have ever\nseen in London. \u2018Malaysia Kitchen\u2019 had been\nadvertised for a couple of weeks with posters\nplastered over Underground walls and food\nbloggers spreading the word like wildfire. I\ncouldn\u2019t decide whether this was an event for\nthe tourists or a more authentic experience\nfor the locals. So on Friday 24th September,\nI dropped by to see the square turn into quite\nan impressive pasar malam (Malay for \u201cnight\nmarket\u201d) with Londoners gathering en masse.\nIt wasn\u2019t quite Jalan Alor (a place famed for\nDana Li old-fashioned food stalls in Kuala Lumpur), but\ncounters representing the many Malaysian restaurants in London were selling the traditional\ndishes such as Nasi Lemak and Roti Canai.\nThe event began with a stunning start when\nI waited thirty minutes to be served five satay\nskewers at Puji Puji. Why? Because they were\nthe only stall that night to have a resident grill,\ndue to Health and Safety being a spoilsport\nand not allowing grills inside the tents. The\ncrowd looked more like a mosh pit than an innocent queue for satay. Was it worth it? Sort of.\nPersonally I was expecting better food on the\nnight, considering these were restaurants that\nnormally charged over twenty quid per person.\nI guess it\u2019s unfair to judge the event because\nthe food was mass produced and the use of paper bowls and plates whilst jostling around the\nhordes of people made it hell on earth. At least\npeople dodged out the way for fear of Laksa\nspilt on their Burberry bags. But street food,\ntypical of a pasar malam, was severely lacking.\nWhat\u2019s more? Food ran out at 7pm and led\nto the hungry turning to nearby Chinatown for\nan antidote.\nThere\u2019s a silver lining however: Malaysia\nKitchen have a Dining Card that offers 20% off\nat restaurants including Awana in South Kensington and Kiasu in Bayswater so check it out\nat www.malaysiakitchen.co.uk for details!\nYour review\nYuki says:\n\u201cTasty, Cheap, Genuine\u201d Japanese food is relatively\nhard to come by.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 08 October 2010 31\nGAMES\nIf there\u2019s one thing people know id Software for, it\u2019s shooters. With such huge titles\nas Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake under their\nbelts some might argue that id Software practically invented the first-person shooter genre\nand it would be hard to argue against them.\nWhy then, with such big names with such established fan bases, would they opt to create a\nwhole new game with a whole new feel?\nWe attended a developer session at Eurogamer for an exclusive working preview of their\nupcoming title, RAGE. \u201cWe wanted to blow\nup the experience,\u201d says creative director Tim\nWillits, who explained that the studio wanted to\nbuild a game with \u201cmore vehicles, more characters and more story,\u201d \u2013 three elements not\nparticularly prevalent in previous games. Tim\nassured us, however, that \u201cthere are no fears for\nfans of id Software,\u201d meaning that players can\nlook forward to RAGE being just as violent as\never.\nThe story is certainly no revolution: following an asteroid apocalypse a secret government\nprogram called the \u2018Eden Project\u2019 is initiated,\nplacing citizens into secret underground bunkers called \u201carks\u201d while those left on the surface become mutants and bandits. With the\nmajority of the arks going wrong for some rea-son, the unnamed player is booted out into the\nwilderness to face a mysterious new government known only as \u201cThe Authority\u201d. Sound\nfamiliar? It should, as it\u2019s pretty much the exact\nsame story from the Fallout series of games.\nAny similarities come to a pretty quick end\nthough once the game has started. With executive producer Jason Kim on the controller, he\nslowly picks his way through some wreckage\nin a way the Fallout engine would simply not\nallow. Soon we are out in the wasteland but\nhere it\u2019s bright and characterful and not bland\nor monotonous. Very quickly we jump into a\nvehicle and are zooming our way through canyons and across plains, stopping to show off the\nvehicle mounted rocket launcher and machine\nguns in an energetic skirmish with some scav-engers.\nWhen we enter one of the main settlements,\nWellspring, the visuals change style yet again\nand we are met with a colourful, vibrant and\ndetailed town that brims over with character.\nIt\u2019s also obvious that id Software is putting\nquite a focus on vehicular gameplay with races,\nshops and even special side quests for upgrading your vehicles. Being in a town also highlights another interesting design choice in the\nfact that your weapons are simply not usable\nwhilst inside. \u201cIt\u2019s not an RPG,\u201d explains Tim.\nThere\u2019s no morality system, no encumbrance\nand hardly any focus on keeping the game open\nplan. Although there\u2019s less options and less\nspace for playing your own game than in Fallout, some of the more boring elements such as\nendless wasteland trudging have been stripped\naway to leave a much quicker-paced game un-derneath, and there still seems to be enough going on to take a break from story missions if\nyou get bored.\nThere\u2019s also clearly been a lot of thought put\ninto combat. Different enemies inhabit each\narea you visit and will move around from time\nto time, and each has their own strengths and\nweaknesses \u2013 we saw both acrobatic enemies\nthat were particularly good at dodging bullets\nand more classic thugs who charged at you\nwith pipes and bricks (who, interestingly, were\ndressed in Union Flags and spoke with cockney\naccents). The weapons are also classic id Software, with the standard shotguns and rocket\nlaunchers making an appearance along with\nelectric crossbows and robot spiders. However, in our preview the enemies did seem to\nbe dispatched with rather quickly which makes\nus worry that they would be slightly underpowered and easy to defeat in the final game. Tension also takes a hit in this instance, as without\nfear driving the experience there\u2019s not much\nadrenaline to keep the game going.\nObviously there will always be some that\nmiss the classic RPG experience that is somewhat missing from RAGE, but we think that by\nremoving some of the more tedious elements\nand forcing the player into first-person shooting RAGE brings a fresh experience to the\ntable that many will enjoy and it comes with\npretty and colourful visuals to boot. Certainly,\nRAGE is going to be one of the big hits of 2011\nand proof that even a company with such a familiar formula as id Software can still innovate\nand produce a truly new gaming experience.\nRAGE\nLittleBigPlanet 2\n\u201cBy removing some of the more\ntedious elements and forcing the\nplayer into first-person shooting,\nRAGE brings a fresh experience to\nthe table\u201d\n\u201cBy removing\n\u201cBy removing\ntedious elem\ntedious elem g\ng\nson shooting,\nson shooting,\nh experience to\nexperience to\nWith such critical acclaim for it\u2019s predeces-sor, it\u2019s hard to think what Media Molecule\ncould do with LittleBigPlanet 2. Whatever it\nwas, it was going to need to big and it was going to need to be innovative. We got the chance\nto play a late build of the game at Eurogamer\nand see what had changed for ourselves.\nThe short answer: not much. Not to say that\u2019s\na bad thing, as the gameplay remains largely\nunchanged from the winning LittleBigPlanet\nformula and is as good as ever. During our\nshort demo we encountered some new gameplay elements in the form of \u2018Sackbots\u2019; cute\nlittle robots that follow you around when you\nrescue them. These little guys do provide a new\nedge as the player is encouraged to rescue as\nmany of them as possible. It\u2019s unclear though\nyet whether there will be any score bonus\nor prizes up for grabs for getting them all to\nsafety. We also spotted some new \u2018launchpads\u2019\nthat can fire players in certain directions and\nbetween layers.\nThe real innovation comes in improvements\nto the level creation mode, which we unfortunately did not get to preview. As well as standard 2.5D platforming levels, creators can now\ncreate races, puzzles and role-playing style lev-els, essentially opening the experience up and\nallowing whole new games to be created. There\nare also options for creating entire linked series\nof levels, where players follow sequentially\nfrom one level to the next. Sackbots will also\nbe available in creator levels with customisable\nAI and appearance, and the creator now also\nincludes a music sequencer and sound effect re-corder. Owners of the old game will be pleased\nto know that any levels made for the original\nwill also work in LittleBigPlanet 2.\nIn addition to all that, the visuals and the\ngraphics engine have had a significant polish and are much improved over the original.\nSmoke effects and much more vibrant lighting\npopulate the new levels, and the backgrounds\nthat were previously relatively simple have\nhad a touch-up as well. With the game looking\nas pretty as ever and the same winning gameplay formula, it looks like LittleBigPlanet 2 is\nshaping up to be another smash hit from Media\nMolecule.\n2 was released to the masses but already this\nnext installment will be gracing our supermarket shelves in just under a month. \u201cIt\u2019s been in\nproduction for a while, in parallel with AC2,\u201d\nsays the Ubisoft minion we cornered, which\nexplains how the next installment is ready so\nquickly.\nThe game is a direct sequel with the single\nplayer campaign featuring the familiar face of\nEzio Auditore as the primary protagonist. Several years have passed since the events of the\nlast game and Ezio is now in Rome recruiting\ncitizens for places in his assassin brotherhood.\nThis is an element that players have direct control over with the recruiting happening during\nthe story and on side quests. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able\nto spend points on them, upgrading them and\ntheir abilities,\u201d chirps an employee manning\nthe stall.\nThere have been some minor changes to\ngameplay, such as the ability to ride horses\nthrough the city and the option to upgrade the\ncity in a similar way to Monteriggioni in the\nprevious game, but the main focus for gamers\nis the new, long-awaited multiplayer mode,\none feature famously missing from AC2. Only\ntwo game-types have been announced so far:\n\u2018Wanted\u2019, an every-man-for-himself game\nwhere players pursue a target whilst being\nchased themselves, and \u2018Alliance\u2019, a similar\ngame with three teams of two where players\nmust work co-operatively. We were told this\nwould be the closest thing Brotherhood would\nhave to co-op gameplay, which seems a shame\nconsidering the obvious fun to be had in the\ncampaign with friends replacing AI brotherhood members. Multiplayer will support system link as well as the usual online capability.\nAt Eurogamer we got the opportunity to play\na few rounds of a \u2018Wanted\u2019match, which lasted\nabout five minutes each. With the familiar Assassin\u2019s Creed control scheme it was easy to get\nstraight into a game and it wasn\u2019t long before\nwe were running across rooftops and leaping\ninto haystacks just like in single player. The\nprimary challenge is finding your target in the\ncity, as every player blends in and looks just\nlike the ordinary civilians around them. The\ngame gives you a few hints in the form of a\ngeneral direction and whether they\u2019re in sight\nor not, but after that it\u2019s up to you, and trying\nto work out who your target is was both fun\nand a real challenge. Psychology comes into\nplay here as your target is notified whenever\nthey come into your view and it\u2019s their choice\n(and, indeed, yours) whether or not they choose\nto run and expose themselves or to hide in the\ncrowd. All too often an enemy gave themselves\naway by bolting as soon as they came into view.\nAs we killed more and more players and (nat-urally) moved our way up the scoreboard, the\ngame compensated by setting more players on\nus to make it harder to pursue our own targets.\nAt certain points both assassin and victim are\npresented with a countdown timer of about ten\nseconds. If the target is in view it remains full\nand red, but as soon as we escaped the timer\nwent yellow (like in single player) and started\nto countdown to zero. During this time hiding\nin hay carts or rooftop shacks sent the bar blue\nand if the countdown reached zero the pursuer\nhad \u2018lost the contract\u2019 and we were safe. This\nwas a great way to bring the hiding mechanic\ninto multiplayer and use hiding skills that are\nwasted on the single player guards, and it was\na real adrenaline-filled moment of tension as\nwe lay wondering whether our pursuer had\nseen us. All in all the multiplayer was an in-tense, enjoyable experience and there\u2019s plenty\nof room for some serious strategy and tactics in\namongst the running and knifing. The tension is\nkept high by the knowledge that you could be\nstruck down at any moment by a pursuer. Our\nonly concern is whether or not the multiplayer\nwill remain popular once the novelty wears off,\nso the challenge for Ubisoft will be to keep the\ngame fresh. Otherwise though, the multiplayer\nseems to be the perfect extension for those who\nhave mastered single player and need a new\nchallenge.\nJazz and Rock\u2019s Rocksplosion\n6 Awesome Imperial Rock Bands\nFREE\n11th October. 19:00 - 23:00\nUnion Concert Hall\n(Union - Floor 2)\nEVENTS\nAlternative Music Society Trip to\nJohn Peel Concert\nBuy Tickets From WeGotTickets\n9th October 1pm\nMeet in Union Bar then heading off\nto Bloomsbury\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX Friday 08 October 2010 13\nThe recommendations made by\nthis man will change universities\nin this country forever.\nBut who is he? And what is the\nBROWNE\nREVIEW?\nT\nhe Browne Review is an assessment of Higher Education Funding launched last\nyear in order to revamp the\ncurrent systems used in University tuition fees. Lord Browne, former\nCEO of BP chairs, instigated the independent review to explore various available options by taking submissions from\nthe Russell Group and other representative bodies into account.\nIn May 2010 the review had proposed\nthat fees should rise by \u00a31000 every year\nfrom 2013 in order to sustain the continually increasing proportions of students\nwho go to University. This would result\nin increases to fees of science degrees in\nparticular would increase to \u00a314,000.\nThere are two realistic options the\ngovernment can take. One is to introduce a Graduate Tax, where University\ngraduates would pay back a sum in proportion to their earnings. The other is\nto lift the cap on tuition fees and allow\nUniversities to charge what they want.\nDavid Willetts, of the Conservatives,\nsaid that \u201cstudents were a burden on\nthe taxpayer that had to be tackled\u2019\u2019,\nand have confirmed they will consider\nthe outcome of the review \u201ccarefully\u2019\u2019,\nwhile Liberal Democrats in government\nhave agreed as part of the coalition to\nabstain on a vote to increase fees, despite many of their MPs signing a pledge\nto vote against such an increase. Vince\nCable has, however, been \u201cseriously\nconsidering\u2019\u2019 a graduate tax, although\nthe Conservatives are reportedly sceptical this would be likely to happen.\nThe Liberal Democrats have traditionally supported free higher education and\nhave promised to abolish tuition fees\nover the next six years.\nLord Browne is considering raising\nfees to \u00a37000 per year, with an option\nof a further \u00a33000. The National Union\nof Students has called this increase\n\u201cunviable\u2019\u2019. Since the political background has changed since the start of the\nBrowne Review, Labour\u2019s new leader\nEd Miliband has aligned against the rise\nin tuition fees and has backed a graduate\ntax to replace them.\nThe Russell Group commented that\n\u201can increase in graduate contributions is\nthe fairest and only viable option for addressing the funding shortfall\u2019\u2019, setting\nout how tuition fees could rise to over\n\u00a39000, a move which students have described as a \u201cnightmare scenario\u2019\u2019. The\nNational Union of Students (NUS) has\nslammed proposals to lift the cap on tuition fees, forecasting \u201cmortgage-style\ndebts\u2019\u2019 of more than \u00a340,000.\nScience, Technology and Medicine\ncourses (STEM) are considered \u201cstrategically important\u2019\u2019, and it has also been\nproposed that \u201cthe level of public funding\nfor a student should be a factor of the cost\nof providing the course, the private return\nand public return, so that no student is\ndeterred from taking courses like STEM\nwhich are expensive to provide.\u2019\u2019 The\nproposal to increase the teaching grant\nfor STEM subjects is considered by the\nImperial College Union a \u201csensible suggestion\u2019\u2019, since Imperial is unable to sub-sidise lab based teaching with the profits\nfrom cheaper classroom based subjects.\nThe graduate tax would be implemented in the way that high cost subjects considered of strategic importance\nto the country would receive more in\nstate funds and cost students less. The\nRussell Group justified the increases by\nexplaining that \u201cif graduates were asked\nto pay steeper fees, they would value\ntheir degrees more highly and be careful\nabout and committed to the choices they\nmade.\u2019\u2019 The group denied that the move\nwould deter students from poor and unprivileged backgrounds from applying\nto University.\nResearch figures uncovered by the Review showed that graduates earn an estimated \u00a3160,000 more than non-grad-uates over their lifetimes, \u00a33000 more\nper year with greater job satisfaction if\nthey were from a Russell Group University. \u2018\u2019The taxpayer continues to foot the\nmajority of the costs of undergraduate\ndegrees and this is unfair\u2019\u2019 it reported.\nSally Hunt, general secretary of the\nUniversity and College Union, said\n\u201cwe desperately need to overhaul how\nUniversities are funded and move away\nfrom the idea that the current review of\nstudent funding is merely a question of\nhow much student fees go up by.\u2019\u2019\nAaron Porter, the president-elect of\nthe NUS has opposed removal of the cap\non fees and has said that this would \u201cexpose students and their families to the\nhuge risks and potential calamities of\nthe market, abandoning them to sink or\nswim\u2019\u2019. The Browne review will report\nits findings next week.\nBy Alex Karapetian\nWhat are the options?\nGraduate Tax\nLifting the cap on fees entirely\nAlthough the outcome of the Browne Review could be a fudged compromise,\nthe debate about higher education funding comes down to these proposals:\nWho backs it?\nHow much will you pay?\nWho backs it?\nHow much will you pay?\nThe Graduate Tax system requires a\nportion of the graduate\u2019s salary to\nbe paid back after their degree. This\nallows the degree to be taught free\nand may raise more money for Universities over long term than capped\ntuition fees. This tax is only levied\non graduates, so students will not\nneed to pay fees while studying. This\nmay, however, incentivise movement\naway from the UK or not graduating.\nTuition fees are currently capped at\n\u00a33,290, but lifting this could result\nin them rising to \u00a37000 or higher.\nOne benefit is that students will\nplace more value in their education\nand their degrees, but also allows\nUniversities to charge how much\nthey need. This may, however, create a price market for degrees, decreasing the amount of applicants to\nUniversities who choose to ask for\nhigher amounts.\nNUS, UCU, Aldwych Group,\nLabour, Liberal Democrats\nImperial College London,\nRussell Group,\nThe Conservatives\nVarying - 0.3 - 0.5% of income\n\u00a37,000 - \u00a314,000 per year\n\n"

As long as\nneither of the two paths lead to my supply of New Forest fudge being cut off, I\ncould care less.\nThe Student Union, as I\u2019ve mentioned,\nis also on the list of things I couldn\u2019t\ngive a bishop\u2019s nipple about. Their recent campaign, fuelled by the news that\nPlant Science is being cut from Imperial\u2019s official remit, is just a wonderful\nexample of everything that is wrong\nwith letting students have an opinion.\n\u201cEducation suffers as Plant Science is\nabandoned\u201d reads the headline, presumably describing two separate, unconnected events.

This is probably\ntrue, and protesting is always a good\nidea. But we\u2019re missing something.\nI found myself in Birmingham a few\nweekends back, having a discussion\nwith my lady about the nature of sci-ence, whilst expertly smearing a pizza\nall over a new shirt. I argued that as\nscientists we have one role \u2013 to work\nshit out. Sometimes that shit requires\npeer review. Sometimes the shit has\nfar-reaching consequences, affecting\nother metaphorically-related faecal mat-ter. But our primary concern is the shit\nitself. We function as a public good to\nsociety, discovering and developing\nthings that are offered up to everyone\nin the world, for their benefit. That\u2019s it.\nOur worth can\u2019t be measured in annual\noutputs, as both the government and the\nprotesters are trying to do. Our effect\non the world is seen over the course of\ndecades, centuries even. It\u2019s glacial in\nprogress terms.\nAnd so budgets get cut, and students,\nresearchers and so on suffer. We protest\nbecause, firstly, we have the right to and\nsecondly, where else can we use those\nwitty anti-government jokes and puns\nwe think up on the commute. But it\u2019s\nimportant not to lose sight of the fact\nthat our job is not to convince the world\nof our worth. That\u2019s a Herculean task.\nOur job is simply our job. Work shit out.\nMy point then, is this - you\u2019re back at\nImperial again/for the first time. Maybe\nyou\u2019ve got the Captain Chuckles thing\ngoing on and you find anyone with an\nounce of genuine interest in their field\nhilarious. That\u2019s fine. I can actually handle that. But if you\u2019re on the other side,\nand you\u2019re interested, and intrigued, and\nwant to spend time in science long after your graduation, remind yourself of\nthis \u2013 no-one wants you here. You\u2019re a\nservice. So if you plan on staying, stay\nfor one reason and one reason only - because you really love this stuff.\nComment on\nthis article\nonline at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nKeep searching, mate, you\u2019ll sooner find proof of God than gratitude for your efforts\nFELIX\nHow will the cuts in the\nLife Sciences Department\nbe affecting you?\nThere is no question that the proposed restructure will adversely affect the students in the short-term. Academics will have to adapt themselves to\nnew areas of research or be let go, researchers in\nthe plant sciences will be less able to follow programmes here, and the breadth of an undergraduate biology degree will be under threat.\nIn such circumstances it is the Union\u2019s duty to\nspeak up for its members, and we applaud its\nstrong stance in their defence. Nevertheless, the\nUnion\u2019s refusal to accept the College\u2019s financial position leaves it open to accusations of shortsight-edness.\nThe department in question has been running\na deficit of almost \u00a3750,000 for the past three\nyears. Of the five sections under its jurisdiction,\nit considers two to be underperforming from the\npoint of view of research quality and profitability.\nThe debate over whether the department is right\nto pinpoint these two sections has been long and\nultimately uninspiring. The figures in question have\nbeen interpreted in two radically different ways,\nwith the correspondence between the Union and\nthe Life Sciences department abounding in discussions of means, medians, box plots and statistical\noutliers.\nHowever the figures are interpreted, we believe\nDr. Ian Owens is justified in refusing to \u2018insult\u2019 his\n\u201cacademics by telling them that their jobs were dependent on a statistical line in the sand.\u201d\nBy far the more interesting question is not whether these two sections are underperforming, but\nwhy. The Union\u2019s stance on this issue is very clear.\nThese are the sections which devote the most time\nto teaching \u2013 an activity which they feel the department views as an unnecessary luxury permitted\nonly to profitable research groups.\nThe response given by the department is unquestionably more financially hard-nosed than we at Felix would have liked, but there is no reason for the\nUnion to level accusations of malice or deception.\nThe department has set commitment to teaching\nas one of its essential criteria for staff retention,\ntakes great pride in excellent tuition, and constantly emphasises the equivalent teaching burden\nspread across its staff.\nWhile the perennial debate over the relative importance of research and teaching is essential to\nthe ensured safety of both, it must be conducted\nin its proper context.\nAs will be made painfully clear to all who read\nthrough the news pages of this issue, science\nfunding in this country will not be spared the austerity measures meted out to all areas of public\nspending. Cuts will have to be made. And if the\nCollege is to preserve its reputation as a centre of\nscientific excellence in a country where science is\nset to take a plunge in the national priority list, it\nneeds to prioritise those activities which allow it to\nkeep its head above the water.\n\u201cIf you plan on staying, stay for\none reason and one reason only\n\u2013 stay because you really love\nthis stuff\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 08 October 2010 21\nARTS\nThe Turner Prize disappoints again\nThe 2010 Turner prize opened on Monday amidst the usual publicity circus,\nhighlights of which this year included\nTate Britain attempting to ban any photographers whose work may \u201cresult in\nany adverse publicity\u201d for the prize, and\nStuckist Charles Thompson leading his\ntraditional anti-prize protest colourfully\n\u2018engaging\u2019with director Nicholas Serota\non the steps of the gallery.\nThis year\u2019s selection spans a wide variety of practices, ranging across paint-ing, sculpture, sound, text and video.\nArguably the best work is also the most\n\u2018traditional\u2019 that of painter Dexter Dalwood. Dalwood\u2019s large paintings are\nnarrative snapshots, single scenes from\nJack Jelfs a larger story. Noticeably devoid of peo-ple, the tale is told by the objects that remain and by their suggestive titles. The\nmost successful is \u2018Death of David Kelly\u2019, in which the moon sags mournfully\nin a deep blue night sky behind a single\ntree. At its roots lies a vague form suggestive of \u2013 what? A mound? A body?\nIt\u2019s unclear, and the quiet lyricism of this\npicture leaves a lasting impression. Although not the greatest technical paint-er, at best Dalwood\u2019s work achieves a\ndreamlike sense of poignancy and loss.\nThe work of The Otolith Group blurs\nthe distinction between curation and\ncreation. Both of their works on display here force the viewer to slow down\nand enter a different mode of attention.\nThe former consists of thirteen television monitors, each showing an episode\nfrom Chris Marker\u2019s 1989 documentary\nseries on Ancient Greece, \u2018The Owl\u2019s\nLegacy\u2019. The work is itself more a piece\nof cultural archaeology - as the Group\nthemselves acknowledge - and harks\nback to a \u2018golden age\u2019 of pre-digital\ntelevision broadcasting, in which genuine scholarship and \u2018high\u2019 culture were\nstill occasionally to be found.\n\u2018Otolith III\u2019 is a 49-minute meditation\nInteresting reflections in Hyde Park\nRox Middleton\nHyde Park is being turned upside down by Anish Kapoor\u2019s latest exi-bition. Four new sculptures have been put up in Kensington Gardens\nin Hyde Park for the next six months, with round-the-clock security\nguards to protect them against people and their grubby fingerprints.\nThe exibition is being put on by the Serpentine Gallery and Royal\nParks together and is entirely free; in short it\u2019s the perfect way to\nspend that spare hour between lectures.\nMarcus du Sautoy (Simonyi professor for the public understanding\nof science at Oxford) described Kapoor as \u201ca modern-day Newton\u201d.\nNot because he, in common with arguably the greatest scientist ever,\nreally likes mirrors, but because he \u201c[uses] art to give the viewer a\nglimpse into the depths of the universe\u201d. On that bombshell, which\nprobably says more about du Sautoy than Kapoor, I\u2019d like to point\nout that this exhibition in Hyde Park is actually just four nice shiny\nmirrors. What is so nice, in fact, is the lack of need for bullshit \u2018interpretations\u2019 of these impressive objects.\nTo see all four at once with minimal effort I suggest going to the\npermanent Statue of Physical Energy \u2013 the one of the man on a horse.\nThe smaller red circle can then be seen peeping over the slope from\nRound Pond, and opposite it is the enormous, satellite-dish-like concave mirror. The symmetry is very pleasing, and then to the right and\nleft of the view of the red disc you can see between the trees the shiny\nbits of sky reflected in the \u2018C-curve\u2019 and \u2018non-object (spire)\u2019.\nAll four sculptures are made of highly polished stainless steel. They\nreflect the park, sky and the people but, being concave (from one side\nat least...) everything is generally upside down. It\u2019s fun to watch the\nway the images warp as you move but it\u2019s also actually lovely to see\nbecause the open vistas of park and sky are condensed into the beautiful shiny \u2018hole\u2019.\nThe reflections of the sky remind you just how much sky there is\nvisible already in Hyde Park and the sheer shininess of it is very sat-isfying. Kapoor himself, who says he walks in Hyde Park frequently,\nwas keen to point out how much the sculptures will change with\nweather and viewer. I went back on a different day and all four really\nwere transformed by the afternoon light and shifting clouds. They are\npieces to admire again and again.\nTurning the World Upside Down runs until 13 March 2011\non themes of creativity and authorship.\nDespite several moments of striking visual poetry, the film starts to drag fairly\nquickly and, for this reviewer at least,\nbecame boring after the first twenty\nminutes or so.\nThe third shortlisted artist isAngela de\nla Cruz, whose sawn-up and deformed\nmonochrome canvasses lie midway between painting and sculpture. Although\nthe games she plays with form are initially amusing, her work does not feel\nrealised enough to be truly interesting,\nand at worst is reminiscent of the juve-nilia one might find on any art foundation course.\nThe final nominee is sound-artist\nSusan Phillipsz. Her piece \u2018Lowlands\nAway\u2019 originally consisted of loudspeakers positioned under each of the\nthree bridges spanning the River Clyde\nin her native Glasgow. Each speaker\nplayed a version of a 16th Century Scottish ballad, sung unaccompanied by\nPhillipsz herself. Relocated to the white\nemptiness of a gallery space, the effect\nis delicately poetic, although one is left\nwishing to experience the piece in its\noriginal context.\nSo there you have it \u2013 four artists, a\ncollection of work ranging from \u2018mediocre\u2019 to \u2018okay\u2019, and one big load of hype.\nAlthough this year\u2019s exhibition contains\na few moments of genuine depth, it\u2019s\nhard to avoid the feeling that it\u2019s all a\nbit... underwhelming.\nThe Red Sky Mirror is at the centre of the Round Pond, so you can\u2019t touch it. Looks like a glorified duck-house when local residents settle in. \u00a9 2010 Dave Morgan\nDisplayed until 3rd January at Tate\nBritain. Tickets \u00a38 (\u00a36)\n\u201c...reminiscent of the\njuvenilia one might\nfind on any art foundation course\u201d\n\n"

This summer, 41 members\nof ICURFC went on a gruelling 18-day\ntour to the land of the rising sun, visiting\nthe ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto,\nas well as the more modern cities of Tokyo and Osaka.\nAs we arrived at Kansai Airport in\nOsaka, we were pleased to see that one\nof our tourists had arrived safely and\nwas waiting for us with a sign - as if\nit would have been difficult to miss 40\nrugby lads, all wearing matching suits!\nAlso waiting for us at the airport were\nrepresentatives from Kyoto University\nRugby Club, who had arranged for a\ncoach to take us to our hostel in central\nKyoto. A couple of hours later, we were\nat our hostel and were settling in to the\ntwo floors that had been assigned to us.\nOur first set of games were the following morning against Kyoto University,\nthe alma mater of South Kensington Kai\nPresident Shunichi Nakamura, however,\nthis did not deter some of the lads to go\nout in search of bars and were feeling\nthe effects of both jet lag and a hangover\nas they got on the bus. As we pulled into\nthe grounds in Kobe, we quickly noticed\nthere was quite a large crowd - this we\nwere definitely not expecting.\nFirst up on the schedule were the Imperial 1st XV, more commonly known\nas the Imperial Ninjas, well at least on\nthis tour they were... Despite the heat\nand humidity, the Ninjas put in a great\nperformance with Centre Joseph Brown\nscoring a hat-trick and Full Back Kieran\nBurge slotting 90% of his kicks that\ngave the Ninjas a 61-19 win. Not a bad\nway to start the tour! The Imperial 2nd\nXV a.k.a the Imperial Barbarians put in\na brave performance against a Kyoto\nside that saw many of their Old Boys\u2019,\nhowever, the jet-lag, humidity and, ul-timately, their hangovers, caused them\nto make small mistakes. In the end, the\nKyoto 2nd XV came away victorious,\nwinning the game 34-19.\nAfter the game, we received our first\ntaste of Japanese hospitality, and it definitely took us by surprise! Waiting for us\nin the function room were tables of beer,\nsushi and fried chicken (!); not only\nthat, but Kyoto players, both past and\npresent had arrived in great numbers to\ngreet the touring side. After some chitchat over some sushi and Asahi beer, the\nformal presentation and speeches com-menced. In an effort to sound clever,\nTour Manager Jovan Nedic, decided\nthat his speech would be in Japanese and\nquickly scribbled down some phrases on\nthe back of a plastic plate. Luckily the\nhosts seemed to understand, but just in\ncase they didn\u2019t, Club Captain Tim Burr\nrepeated the speech in English and also\npresented the Club with an IC shield,\nplaying jersey and a silver tankard. That\nevening was definitely a memorable experience with the two clubs exchanging\nrugby culture - them, singing their club\nsong to us, whilst we presented them\nwith an Imperial College London tan-kard, full of beer and a rousing round of\n\u201cGet it down, you Zulu warrior!\u201d\nThere was a whole week until the next\ngame and that time was spent sightseeing the temples and shrines of Kyoto and\nNara during the day, whilst socialising\nwith our Kyoto hosts in the evening.

The Union said \u201cThe\ndelay in removing this has largely been\ndue to the nature of the water main and\nthe necessity for Thames Water to action this removal which has taken an\nunprecedented length of time.\u201d\nThe Union has stated that the delays are regrettable and disappointing,\nthough they have had no financial impact on the Union over and above the\n\u201cThe Union\ncommented that\nthe delays are\nregrettable and\ndisappointing\u201d\nFELIX Friday 08 October 2010 3\nFreshers make do with\nmarquee as bar and\nclub remain closed\nThe opening of the new Imperial College Union venues FiveSixEight (can\u2019t\nthey count?) and Metric has been delayed by 3 weeks and 1 month respec-tively. Disappointed students will have\nto wait until the 18th of October to experience the new bar FiveSixEight and\nthe 29th of October for the new club\nMetric.\nConstruction on the club Metric was\nhampered by a number of complications\nincluding uncovering unknown basements and voids during the removal of\nthe pillar that used to stand in the centre\nof the club. Ravi Pall, Deputy President\n(Finance & Services), stated that there is\nno one reason why the Metric opening\ndate has shifted. Rather, the age of the\nbuilding has resulted in a combination\nof delays including the removal of old\npipe work but the Union acknowledged\nthat Metric would almost certainly have\nopened on time had it not been for the\nremoval of the pillar. However they did\nadd that \u201cnot removing it would have\nheavily compromised the quality of the\nvenue and the user experience as well as\nCharles Betts\nTerror assault police officers to join\nBabar Ahmed in jail?\nA group of police officers accused of\nattacking former employee of Imperial College and terrorist suspect Babar\nAhmad appeared in court last month.\nPolice Constables Mark Jones, 43, Roderick James-Bowen, 40, Nigel Cowley,\n33, and Detective Constable John Donohue, 36, appeared at City of Westminster\nMagistrates\u2019 Court, intending to plead\nnot guilty. The case has been committed\nto Southwark Crown Court for October\n29th.\nMr. Ahmad, 35, worked full-time as\nan ICT Support Analyst supporting both\nundergraduates and postgraduates until\nhe was arrested on December 2nd 2003.\nMatt Colvin\noriginal project costs.\nThe delayed opening of the two venues has not affected Welcome Week,\nthough major changes were forced to be\nmade including the erection of a transparent marquee in Beit Quad, allowing\nall to see the debauchery from within.\nThe Union bar is open as usual.\nOpinion amongst Freshers has been\ngenerally positive, with the acknowledgment that construction projects typically face inevitable set-backs and that\nthe Union appears to have done enough\nto address the situation, most importantly with plenty of cheap booze still\navailable.\nThough perhaps Tarquin, a Science\nCommunication student, summed it up\nbest when saying \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter when the club is ready- Crazy Larry\u2019s\nis still open and there\u2019s nowhere better\nto get sloshed, have a bloody good time,\nand see oodles of skirts.\u201d\nHe was accused of using websites and\ne-mail in order to raise money to support terrorism in both Chechnya and Afghanistan amongst other allegations relating to handling US naval documents.\nFollowing a pre-dawn raid in Tooting by\nanti-terrorist officers, he was left with\nover 70 physical injuries.\nHe was subsequently released six days\nlater but in August 2004 was re-arrested\nunder the controversial 2003 US-UK\nExtradition Treaty. He has been held in\ncustody ever since without charge.De-spite vehement pleas from Mr. Ahmad\nto either charge or release him, alongside those who claim that some of the\nevidence that forms the basis of the case\nis unsatisfactory, the US government\nremains determined to see Mr. Ahmad\nstand trial in their own country.\nIn March 2009, Mr. Ahmad was\nawarded \u00a360,000 compensation following the admission of the anti-terrorist\npolice that, in the process of his arrest\nin 2003, they subjected him to \u201cgrave\nabuse, tantamount to torture\u201d.\nThe latest news of the ongoing court\ncase is unlikely to come as any consolation to Mr. Ahmad. While his extradition to the US has been halted by the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, he remains in custody at Long Lartin Prison in\nWorcestershire.

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 8 october 2010\nFILM\nIn case you didn\u2019t know, Edgar Wright likes comic books...\nDirector Edgar Wright\nScreenwriter Michael Bacall,\nEdgar Wright\nCast Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth\nWinstead, Kieran Culkin, Anna\nKendrick\nScott Pilgrim vs.\nThe World\nGrosse Pointe Blank. Back to the Future. The Dark Knight. Three films that I\ncould watch on repeat \u2013 again and again.\nI left Scott Pilgrim vs the World wanting\nto go straight back in for another round.\nThe titular character, played by Michael\nCera, is a 23-year-old with no job, who\nsplits his time between playing bass in\nthe raw, energetic indie band Sex Bobomb (the music played by the actors\nthemselves), maintaining a U-rated relationship with a Canadian-Chinese high\nschool girl (the adorable Ellen Wong)\nand mooching off his flatmate (Kieran\nCulkin), with outrageously apt comic\ntiming and delivery.\nIt isn\u2019t long before his quirky existence is disturbed by the arrival of the exotic American Ramona Flowers who is\nquite literally the girl of Scott\u2019s dreams.\nTheir burgeoning relationship precipitates in Scott having to battle in turn\nwith each one of her seven (yes, seven!)\nevil exes who have banded together to\ncontrol Ramona\u2019s romantic life.\nIf you have ever wondered what a\ncomputer game version of real life\nwould look like then this movie smashes the answer through your brain with\nan invigorating mix of the subtle and\nslapstick. Those familiar with Edgar\nWright\u2019s work will see the hallmark cultural references and character interplay\nthat stood out in Shaun of the Dead and\nHot Fuzz. Whether you are a hardcore\ngamer or not, many of the stylised battles will be immediately familiar as resembling those of the popular games of\nour youth.\nMichael Cera has often been criticised\nfor allowing himself to be typecast as a\nbit of a wet blanket, but he brings inner\nAditya Narayanan\nsteel to this role as Scott \u2013 an inoffen-sive, amiable everyman who conceals a\ncunning mind that skilfully manipulates\nthose who underestimate him. His love\ninterest, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, balances being effortlessly cool\nwith maintaining a girl-next-door-with-oversized-sledgehammer-in-her-purse\nimage. The rest of the cast include several \u2018promising young things\u2019 in steady\nroles such as Anna Kendrick and a\nscene-stealing Kieran Culkin as Scott\u2019s\nwry, gay, playboy flatmate \u2013 both are\nterribly underused.\nHowever, this film isn\u2019t really about\nthe acting, which takes a backseat to\nthe outrageous, videogame action and\nmachine-gun dialogue. This is, in part,\nsupposedly due to the faithful adherence\nto Bryan Lee O\u2019Malley\u2019s script \u2013 at least\naccording to friends who have read the\nseries. If, like me, you haven\u2019t (damn\nWaterstone\u2019s and their slack delivery\nservice), fear not \u2013 though some of the\nstory does not transfer to the big screen\nquite as well as one would hope, the film\ndoes not suffer too much. The set pieces\nand combat sequences are superbly cho-reographed, such that the viewer feels\nevery hit or note within the movie, aided\nby the excellent special effects on show.\nAnd it goes without saying that watching this anywhere but the cinema is to\nmiss out.\nAnother area where the film really\nstands out is in the soundtrack, which\nis a perfect selection for the film, allowing you to be immersed in the emotional themes the film plays on. This is\nin no way a backhanded compliment as\nthe music augments the quality of the\nfilm. The only shame is that another\n10-20 minutes to develop the story and\ncharacters would have eased the transition between the two different media.\nNevertheless, this is a difficult feat for\nanyone to perform and the film certainly lives up to the stellar reputation of\nthe graphic novels. Scott Pilgrim vs the\nWorld is an exhilarating rush of positiv-ity \u2013 the perfect start to the new college\nyear.\nHow comic book geeks get girls: Exhibit A\n\u00a9 Ernst &Young 2010.

Recent accounts filed to\nthe Charity Commission in July, however, show that\nthe Royal Institution is facing serious debt of more\nthan \u00a32m. As new chairman, Sir Richard will now\nbe responsible for the administration of fundraising\nof the organisation and its development. Sir Paul\nNurse, incoming president of the Royal Society,\nbelieves Sir Richard will be able to relieve the long\nstanding financial stresses incurred, \u201cThis appointment will give strong leadership and much needed\nstability to the Royal Institution.

Not that we gather solely for the\npurpose of sharing body heat but rather\nin order to pay homage the returning\nprodigal son that is Willy Mason, playing his first UK headlining show since\nthe good old days of 2007.\nA distinct smell of damp greets us\nas we enter; this evening\u2019s headliner\nfalls firmly under the folk troubadour\ntitle and so it is no head scratcher that\na whole spectrum of check shirts are on\nparade amongst this selection of eclectically aged demographic.

This seems appropriate as thematically it deals with home, something\nthat appears frequently throughout Mason\u2019s songs. Mason also channels a tradition of American song writing much\nin the same way that Dylan pre-Blonde\non Blonde channelled Woodie Guthrie.\nHowever whereas Dylan would fall\nback on more abstract images in his\nhumanitarian sentiment, Mason is ex-plicit, with his notions of community\nand togetherness very much evident.\nThe openness and naivety of Mason\nmakes him one of the most endearing songwriters of our generation, his\nheartfelt desire for justice and equality\nbeautifully demonstrated in \u2018Oxygen\u2019,\nMason\u2019s eternal cry for a better world\nin one the purest pieces of song writing\never penned.\nThe set is perfectly judged; the first\nhalf consists of a mixture of new songs\nand tracks from his charming debut LP\n\u2018Where the Humans Eat with Hard Hand\nto Hold\u2019 being particularly enjoyed by\nthe crowd. Halfway through, Mason\u2019s\nbacking band head backstage for a well\ndeserved break with Mason wryly remarking that he had failed to join the\nworkers\u2019 union. As an isolated figure,\nMason shines delivering a newly penned\ntender ballad by the name of \u2018the Need\nof Love\u2019: perhaps one of his strongest\nsongs to date as he recounts the tale of\nyoung woman from a small mid-west\ntown, not searching but desperately\nin need of affection. Mason\u2019s voice is\nparticularly striking and with his band\nabsent it comes to the fore; he seems to\nput no physical effort into his projec-tion, yet creates a rich reverb of blissful\nAmericana. He brings tremendous depth\nto riptide as he reminiscences about\ncarving his name into a cedar tree whilst\nthe \u2018water in his soul, it is going to the\nocean\u2019.\nThe band returns to close the set with\na rousing rendition of \u2018Save Myself\u2019\nwith the enthusiastic crowd providing\ndelicately pitched backing vocals and an\ninteresting re-working of a 17th century\nlove song, provided by one of Mason\u2019s\nfemale on stage accomplices. Mason is\nin good spirits throughout and seems\nto be genuinely moved by the warmth\nof the crowd; such good feeling paves\nEasy now. I know all this talk of \u2018Willy\u2019 and \u2018Bush\u2019 is exciting, but I assure you Mr.\nMason was the only Willy getting big love in the Bush... Well, in public at least\nthe way for an uplifting encore which\nof course contains the aforementioned\n\u2018Oxygen\u2019. After a personal 5 year wait\nfor this event, I am deeply moved to be\nhearing these songs in the flesh, I exit\nonto a wet and windy Uxbridge Road\nwith Mason firmly cemented in head\nand heart.\nSerj Tankian\nImperfect Harmonies\nReprise/Serjical Strike\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nDeerhunter\nHalycon Digest\n4AD\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nNo Age\nEverything In Between\nSub Pop\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAbe Vigoda\nCrush\nPPM\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nLinkin Park\nA Thousand Suns\nWarner Bros.\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nTankian has been particularly active during SOAD\u2019s hiatus, releasing one critically praised solo album\n\u2018Elect The Dead\u2019 and performing its\nentirety on tour with a full symphonic\norchestra. This experience confirmed\nTankian\u2019s talents as a composer, and\nhis second solo outing is further proof\nof this man\u2019s musical genius. Brilliantly blending electronic beats with\norganic symphonic instruments along\nwith his inimitable voice, \u2018Imperfect\nHarmonies\u2019 is a forward-thinking and\nexcellently executed collection of\nsongs which are guaranteed to have\nyou singing along. - Greg Power\nBradford Cox and company return\nwith an album that is definitely a\nprogression from previous releases.\nSprawls of noise have been refined,\nleaning towards the band\u2019s poppier\nside that was exhibited on their last\nalbum \u2018Microcastle\u2019. Their trademark\nurgency has also been relaxed and the\ngeneral feel is more laid back. Deerhunter have never had a definitive\nsound which means that every new album can carve its own ground, instead\nof trying to recapture or rework an old\nfeeling. \u2018Halycon Digest\u2019 is a grower,\nand will feel more rewarding with a\nfew listens. - Chris Walmsley\n2007\u2019s critically acclaimed \u2018Nouns\u2019\nwas an aggressive sonic attack, but\nthis new release from LA based No\nAge benefits from more production\nand melody throughout. The raw punk\nrock energy has not been sacrificed,\nbut songs like \u2018Depletion\u2019 are now\nmixed with subdued anthemic pop\nclassics like \u2018Glitter\u2019. No Age will\nbe winning no awards for vocal vir-tuosity, but Dean Spunt\u2019s voice has\nbeen raised in the mix for most songs.\nDespite the praise for their previous\nrecord, this new album feels more\ncomplete and as a result far more ac-cessible. - Chris Walmsley\nAbe Vigoda, a \u201ctropical punk\u201d\n4-piece from the same scene as No\nAge, have reconfigured their sound\nwith one eye firmly on The Cure\u2019s\ndiscography. What could be a hollow\nexercise in Eighties revivalism is ably\ndodged by the band\u2019s excellent song-writing. The frenetic guitars and galloping rhythms, a trademark of their\nearlier work, have been toned down in\nfavour of synth lines and histrionic vo-cals. While the stormy atmosphere of\nthe album can sometimes get oppres-sive, it is exciting to hear a band finding a different framework to channel\ntheir unique sound. - Jamie Fraser\nAfter the aberration that was 2006\u2019s\n\u2018Minutes To Midnight\u2019 there is a\nstrong chance most fans of LP\u2019s first\ntwo albums have dismissed the band\nentirely by now. In a surprising turn\nof events the rap-rockers have decided to ditch the obvious formulaic\narena-pleasers and instead opt for a\nmore experimental approach this time\naround. Half the album is composed\nof short electronic experiments and\nthe other half contains some genuinely good songs, especially the amazing\n\u2018Blackout\u2019. There is much work to be\ndone but this new direction is definitely an improvement. - Greg Power\nOne man, two benches... Willy\nrocks the picnic table.\n\n"

Professor\nJulia Buckingham, Pro-Rector (Educa-tion and Academic Services) agrees,\nobserving that \u201cthere has been a move\nin some departments to actually reduce\nthe amount of coursework, and I think\nthat will help.\u201d\nBut there is certainly an issue of motivating academics to take teaching\nseriously. Dr. Tony Field, Director of\nUndergraduate Studies for Computing,\nexplains why he believes that his department is instead nationally competi-tive, \u201cI think it\u2019s possibly the mindset.\nThe academics take their work seriously\nand if we tell them coursework has to\nbe marked properly and within 2 weeks\nthen by and large they do it. I get the impression other departments find it harder\nto get their academics to do that.\u201d\nIndeed, some departments have highlighted a certain culture that exists of\nacademics focussing on their research\nrather than their teaching duties, often to\nbring more money into the department.\nProfessor Matar believes that \u201c(academics) have got a lot of research and some\nadministration to do as well as teaching.\nIt\u2019s a fine balancing act.\u201d But Professor\nMacKinnon, Director of Undergraduate\nStudies for Physics, went further, saying that \u201cEvery university says teaching\nand research have equal weighting. Few\nacademics actually believe that.\u201d\nDr. Lorraine Craig, a senior member\nof staff for Earth Science and Engineering is adamant that this reluctance on the\npart of academics does not exist in her\ndepartment, firmly believing that \u201cstaff\nwant to see their students learn, progress and get very good jobs at the end\nof their time here. They look after their\ntutees and students that they\u2019re supervising and there is that bond - that link.\u201d\nShe also admits that the department is\nrelatively small in comparison to oth-ers, acknowledging that, \u201cwhat works\nwithin this department might not work\nin others.\u201d\nDespite the urgency of the Rector\u2019s\nletter and the aim of departments to im-prove, many of those questioned claim\nto already meet the target for a two week\nfeedback turnaround. Professor Berkshire outlines that, \u201cwe aim to have essentially 12 days turn around. By and\nlarge we achieve it\u201d while Professor\nMacKinnon reveals that \u201cthere are one\nor two exercises we could probably do\nfaster than (two weeks).\u201d Dr. Craig aims\nto reduce the department\u2019s turnaround\nto one week instead, explaining that \u201cif\nwe\u2019ve got a deadline, we work to that\ndeadline. We just change the mindset.\u201d\nFurther suggestions towards addressing the problems include a formal contract between staff and students, cementing the expectations that a student would\nhave of their department and equally\nstaff of their students. Mentioned last\nyear by the former Deputy President for\nEducation, Jonathan Silver, it has met\nwith some positive comments. Professor Matar suggests that \u201cthere needs to\nbe a contract between us and them\u201d and\nProfessor MacKinnon is \u201cnot overly opposed\u201d to the idea, but points out that\nsuch a system may \u201clead to unnecessary\nlitigation\u201d.\nAdd into this mix the impending government cuts and changes to Higher Education Funding and it\u2019s quickly obvious\nthat improving teaching isn\u2019t going to be\nstraight forward or quick. Julia Buckingham was keen to emphasise that there\nneeds to be a cultural change at Imperial\nwhich will take some time.\nStudents give damning\nverdict on teaching standards\nThe College makes coursework feedback and marking a priority as Rector tells staff\nhe is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the National Student Survey results\ndents about both pastoral and academic\nissues, leading to more detailed feedback on student satisfaction rather than\nother league tables that place emphasis\non academic success.\nThe College has generally fared well\nin the results, released in August, which\ngive Imperial an overall satisfaction rating of 85%, placing the university 43rd\nnationally and 13th amongst Russell\nGroup universities. One of the more impressive results is the rating of 90% for\nsatisfaction with the College\u2019s learning\nresources, well above the national average of 80%.\nHowever, one particular area of concern that the survey highlights is student satisfaction with assessment and\nfeedback. Disquiet about this is not restricted to final year students alone. Last\nyear, feedback from the College\u2019s TOLE\n(Tutorial Online Evaluation) undergraduate survey highlighted concern in the\ndepartments of Chemical Engineering\nand Chemistry, while Civil Engineering\nrefused to cooperate and send feedback\nto personal tutors.\nCurrent Rector, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions,\nhas made the issue a top priority, as evidenced by a strongly worded letter sent\nto departments to highlight the problem.\nHe has advised that departments take\n\u201cstrong and concerted action\u201d and set a\ntimetable for when students can expect\nto submit coursework and receive feed-back. He has suggested that in certain\ncases, departments should \u201cconsider\nreducing the amount of coursework the\nstudents are required to do\u201d should they\n\u201cget maximum benefit from the feedback.\u201d The question is whether the current situation can be improved upon by\nthe next College surveys at the end of\nterm.\nCan we solve a problem like teaching?\n\u201cEvery university\nsays teaching and\nresearch have equal\nweighting.
