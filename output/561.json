Dear Steve Your editorial on anti apartheid could have been ignored had it\nonly concentrated on personal attacks as a substitute lor any argument. However, your few points are wrong as well, so I hope you will print this correction. Firstly, while all major banks are involved in South Africa, Barclays is virtually the South African bank, so large is its investment. If you consider attacks on Barclays' unfair', what do you think of the torturing and oppression of many South African people, aided and abetted by Barclays. For your information, the anti apartheid movement draws its\nsupport from all sections of political thought, and from many people uninvolved in party politics who simply share an abhorrence of the inhumanity of apartheid, among them church and community leaders. Hardly an' extreme' organisation. Finally, the campaign against investment with apartheid pays dividends. Many firms are now wary of investing in South Africa. Midland Bank is considering d is investing, and Brent Borough Council is poised to do so, to the\ntune of X JOO. OOO plus. Jours sincerely\nPhil Cole\nChem Eng 2\n( The subject of my editorial was not anti apartheid, but simply the\nsmear campaign on Barclays Bank by the Anti apartheid Group. Your letter is not printed as a correction to my editorial, but as\na collection of unconnected thoughts and silly argument un worth v of any serious comment \u2014 Ed.)\nWhereas it is fair practise to\nedit contributions to newspapers in order to aid clarity of presentation, to remove grammatical errors, to meet constraints imposed by space limitations, or things such like, it borders on censorship to delete a whole paragraph in\nsuch a manner as you recently did.I refer to your expurgated version of the write upon African Caribbean Society on page eleven of FELIX issue number560. Not only did you cut out the\nsection pertaining to South Africa from our contribution, you proceeded to unleashing a diatribe in\nyour' editorial' on some students in College who happen to hold conscientious and well informed opinions \u2014 as is their right to do in a democracy \u2014 on the vexatious issue of apartheid. However, because those students are capable of defending themselves, I shall\nnot digress from my main point. Since Iam unable to trace the\nrelevant section in the Union' Blue Book' where the FELIX Editor is constitutionally permitted to censor contributions, and since,\nas I write this, I'm made to believe that freedom of expression exists here at IC no less than your cherished 'press freedom', may I resubmit the section that fell under your axe for inclusion in the next issue of FELIX?\" It may come as a shock to\nyou, but there's a strong South African connection here. If you' re not alert, you may end up sub sidi sing trips to apartheid land. If, as\nit must be the case if you area registered student here, you pay some \u00a3 4 0 to the student union, then some part of that money could easily end up being used to\nentertain the fascists from Pretoria. Just keep close eye on motions coming up at the Union General Meetings.\" From\nDave Afolabi\nAfrican-Caribbean Society\nPS: Could you refrain from mutilating this letter?\n( Your article was not censored but merely edited( how boring!) to meet the constraints of space limitations. I considered that as\nyour article was intended to bean introduction to Afro CaribS oc, and that as it was too long, a paragraph on anti apartheid could easily be reserved for a future issue \u2014 Ed.)\nTo Whom It May Concern\nThe Guilds VicePresident' s Jacket was removed unlawfully on Monday from the Concert Hall. As a result, since it is not a mascot the College security and police have been informed. If anyone knows who took it, or wher? it is.\nI would be grateful if they would let me or anyone else in Guilds know via our post rack. And if the\njacket is returned intact during the coming week no further action will betaken. Ruth\nVP Guilds\nSir,\nI was surprised to read in you rPG FELIX that the writer of the\narticle on the Cambridge Beer Festival trip considered that the\nnumber of beers on sale (a mere two dozen) was beyond the capacity of\" any normal person in\na single day\". I myself, together with several companions, each managed to\ndrink of all the beers on sale on that day. What sort of weak live red teetotaller wrote such an article, sir, that would consider this above normal capacity?

    "content": "Reviews\n'Torrance confronts the barman.\nFilms THE\nSHiMiHQ\nWHEN Jack Torrance is offered the job\nof caretaker at an isolated hotel which will\nbe left empty through the harsh Colorado winter, he does not realise that many dangers await him there.\nThus the scene is set for the return to\nthe screen of two great artists, director\nStanley Kubrick and the brilliant Jack Nicholson, who stars as Torrance.\nThe Overlook Hotel is a vast building\nperched high in the Colorado mountains\nwhich is only inhabited by a caretaker and\nhis family during the winter months. Some\nyears previous to Torrance's arrival a horrific\nmurder was committed there by a caretaker\ncalled Grady, who brutally slaughtered his\nwife and daughters with an axe. Torrance\nsmiles broadly when informed of this \u2014 no\nneed to worry about anything like that with\nhim, he says.\nJack is accompanied by his wife Wendy\n(Shelley Duvall) and son Danny, who is\napparently possessed of a power dubbed 'shining' (hence the title), which is some form\nof psychic ability allowing him to briefly\nglimpse the future and past. He for sees evil\nat Overlook and on arrival starts to\nencounter various, spirits from the hotel's sordid past.\nNicholson gives an excellent performance\nin the leading role. Torrance is affected by\nthe isolation and strange forces present at\nthe hotel. Indeed, the most impressive parts\nof the film are not so much the scenery or\neffects, but the gradual contortion of\nNicholson's features as he is transformed\nfrom a loving husband to murderer. His eyes\nseem to harbour a deep-seeded malevolence\nand the intensity of his insanity becomes\nmore and more apparent from his evil grin.\nHe begins to encounter the embodiment s of\nthe spirits present; he drinks with a ghostly\nbarman and confronts a beautiful girl who\nbecomes transformed in his arms (into . . .\nArrrgh!). Eventually he picks up his axe and\nstarts to pursue his family through the\ndeserted hotel.\nStanley Kubrick, too, has done some\nexcellent work. His blend of music is in itself\nvery impressive and some of the photography\nis breathtaking. Despite all this, however,\nsomething seems to fall a little short. I found\nthat the whole story would probably have\nbeen extremely boring and straightforward if\nnot for Nicholson's brilliant performance \u2014\nhe seemed to hold the whole thing together.\nThe blame for this must lie at Kubrick' s door, who wrote the screenplay with Diane\nJohnson from a novel by Stephen King. I think that we could have been treated to\nmany more ingenious twists in the plot.\nNevertheless, as it stands the film is\nbeautiful, horrific at times and certainly the\nbest horror feature of recent years. Unfortunately it is not a classic of the genre as\nsome writers seem to suggest. Perhaps they\nare referring to Nicholson's classic per for The Special Edition of\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\nThis film is well worth a second viewing, if\nonly to reinforce its position as a classic of\nthe genre. The re-editing and re-shooting of\nsome scenes has much enhanced the whole.\nSome inclusions are obvious, the discovery\nof a ship in the Gobi Dessert for one.\nHowever, the much less obvious changes in\nthe home life of the character played by\nRichard Dreyfuss are the key. In the original\nthe post-Watergate difficulty in coming to\nterms with authority caused these scenes to\nlack a certain credibility. Instead Dreyfuss is\nseen as a man who has retained a sense of\nwondering innocence (his championing of\nthe film Pinnochio) and finds himself looking\nfor more in life \u2014 open to suggestion from\nabove, when he sees the UFOs, which he\nunquestionably accepts as real. His family\nwith whom he is unable to communicate\nsuggest the 'Grown Ups' in Peter Pan in\ntheir mentality. But he rises above self-doubt\nthrough a. period of suffering, his family\nbecoming superfluous after he finds that his\nmountain exists.\nThe other visible change is the inclusion\nof Dreyfuss ascending into the alien starship, here Spielberg uses the song Wish\nUpon A Star to reflect almost a magical\natmosphere. It can be argued that this, is\nbest left to one's imagination; it is certainly\nimagination that makes the initial scene of\nthe toys becoming alive so horrifying. The\nfinal message of some greater power first\nsc rut in ising and then redeeming Earth, has a ready following, as Chariot of the Gods has\nshown. Indeed the basic idea of the plot: of\na man being chosen; the why-me feeling of\ninadequacy; the final movement to some\nspiritual serenity could easily become ridiculous on the screen, except that hope is\nin demand when the spectre of war and\nuncertainty rises. Thus one is left with a film\nthat owes as much to Walt Disney' s animated classics of the '30s and '40s as it\ndoes to the precocious talents of its\ndirector, Stephen Spielberg. Its stars probably ought to reflect that, along with\nthose banes of the acting world: animals and\nchildren, they ought not to act with spaceships.\nStephen Goulder\nConcerts class ix nouveau xI must congratulate ENTS on producing a great fresher s' gig.\nThe support, Time Flies, started slowly but\ngrew on me. Quite enjoyable, but still pretty\naverage.\nA large audience were blinded as Classix\nNouveaux turned the white lights on them\nfor their intro. The lights faded and they\nbegan their set. I had never seen Classix\nbefore and I was impressed; especially by Sal\nSolo, the vocalist. He had an amazing voice\nrange put to good use with his 'controlled'\nvi brat to scream, much to the enjoyment of\nthe audience. They finished with The Robots\nDance ( their single).S alSo lo gave a magnificent performance clad in a tight white\nsuit \u2014 accompanied by strobe effects, the\ntrue robot image came over very well.\nNot surprisingly, an encore was demanded.\nThe Tin Teapot\nFELIX, October 3, 1980 Page 5\n\n"

I talked to them\nagain this morning and they said\nthey'd come over after tea, so, I hope they're fixed by the time\nyou're reading this'.\nMoral: if there's a defect,\nreport it immediately, and then\nplease, try and be patient.\nAnd Finally\nThis doesn't seem much to\nreport after a busy week, but I'm sure I 'll have much more to say\nnext week.\nRae\nElectric Jazz\nStan's Real Ale Bar\n8:30pm, Wednesday\n8th October\nMy Wee Little Bit\nOn Insurance\nThe insurance policy arranged on behalf of student residents in Halls and Houses is\nsummarised below.

Over a hundred clubs were reported at the Fair and most reported a good turnout. The Union Bar was well used as it stayed open till 4 : 3 0 pm. Cup Sails Away\nAT Fresher s' Fair, a small silver plated cup belonging to the Sailing Club was stolen. The cup was one of two on exhibit on the Sailing Club stand on the Queen's Lawn. Student Seriously\nInjured\nAF'TER the Life Sciences party on Tue s dav night. Ian Johnson( Life Sci2) fell off the' balcony outside the J CR where the party was held. He sustained injuries to\nhis head and was rushed to St Stephens Hospital. Esoteric Ineptitude\nON MONDAY night, a call was put out over the Union t annoy asking for the return of the three handled pot. RCS Union officers\ncould be seen looking extremely worried as they' questioned' various Union Bar customers. Paul Johnson( RC SUV P) summed up the situation later by tapping his nose and saying:\" It's OK,I 've got it all under control\". It is understood by FELIX that the pot was taken by persons known only to the inner sanctum of RCS. It is suspected that they were inept Guilds men who believed the pot to be a violate mascot, but who knows, or indeed cares?\nExec News Short\nONLY500 copies of Exec .\\ett s were printed for the U GM yesterday. The usual number is between a1,000 and1,500. Of this 5 0 0 ,\n450 were distributed in a frenzy of excitement at the Rector's Reception, leaving just50 lor the UG M.Asa result, Liz Lindsay decided to reprint the motions before the U GM, leaving officers\nreports to be read. The first U GM of term is usually well attended; to the astonishment of all present, this year's initial U GM was in quo rate, the quorum being called by Mr Stephen Gould er on completion of the officers' reports. This lead to heated discussion, the fact that it\nhad been in quo rate was obvious from the beginning. At12:52 pm the number present numbered15 or20, the number increased but the spaces made the seats both conspicuous and numerous. However, the meeting was opened, only those with the luck to have a copy of Exec .News knowing the agenda beforehand. Visibly annoyed, Mr John Passmore delivered his report which was received in almost muted silence. The sense of anticlimax was palpable. The Hon Sec, Liz Lindsay, followed. Continued on back page.\nRector's Speech Boring\nAs Ever\nAT THE Fresher s' Reception on Monday, the Rector, the IC Union President and several other officers of the Union delivered speeches to the incoming undergraduates; a similar PG Reception was held a little later. The main theme of the speeches was participation and involvement in the Union. The Rector delivered practically the same speech as last\nyear which left the fresher s with a great sense of a we and the Union officers on the stage with a great sense of tedium. The reception ended with general C CU tomfoolery. However, during the proceedings the Guilds VP' s coat was stolen. The coat contained Ruth Hildebrand' s wallet and cheque book. The coat is still missing at the time of going to press but the cheque book and wallet were found on Tuesday. Security Move\nSINCE Monday's edition of FELIX, two gentlemen from the Estates Dept of College have visited Rae S nee to inspect the trophy cabinet and to look at the Union Office Security in general. They have promised faithfully to get something done in the very near future. The cost of closing the stable door is not yet known as\nthe degree of Union security desired has not been decided. Deputy Registrar\nRetires\nBILL ROBERTSON, the Deputy Registrar, retired on Tuesday after 13 years at the College. At a celebration party, he was awarded Honorary Life Membership of IC Union. Last year, he was awarded a Union General Award by Chris Fox. We at FELIX all wish him along and haj a py retirement. Bo And Derrick\nGUILDS finally got around to naming Ner a car at the Fresher s'U GM on Tuesday. It was decided that the name chosen had to compliment' Bo'. Suggestions ranged from the pur ile,(' peep' and' geste') to the brilliant(' L LOCKS'). In the end it came down to ach oise of two, the already mention' L LOCKS' and' Derrick'. After a show of hands and a count' Derrick' was declared the winner and the name is now official.\nBishop Takes Queen\nAT the R CSU GM in the Great Hall on Monday, Sarah Bishop( Life Sei1)wa selected Queen of J ez. Later in the afternoon she was shown the fire engine by an assortment of RC Shacks. Sarah' s major duty during the coming year will be to adorn J ez on the Rag Procession in November.

    "content": ";:;::Wf>i:^::li ill ll l FElIX Feature/ kr tic li> Tim Hillyer investigates the likely outcome of mining Harlington, the College sports ground\n\u00a31m BOOST FOR STUDENT RESIDENCE\nThe sand and gravel deposits under the College Sports\nGround at Harlington are now certain to be exploited\nduring the eighties. When first discussed in FELIX No\n547 (Friday 7th March), the question of extracting the\nminerals from the college land was treated coolly by\nSherfield administration; but negotiations have now\nreached an advanced stage and planning permission\nseems to be a formality.\nOf course, the College is to\nhandle this as a serious commercial undertaking, and will no doubt ensure the highest possible\nfinancial return and the most favourable terms. However several important decisions have been made already about' how the profit is to be spent. Instead of allowing the estimated \u00a3 1 million royalties to go into the general College finances, and in some way' sub sid is e' services, academic and ancillary, the money will be used on student housing. Although the exact form these improvements will take is\nnot yet definite, capital spending on new halls and houses is most likely. At present, this would seem to mean a further extension to\nL instead Hall or even a newhall to be built on the site of the tennis courts. Another possibility is the completion of the long delayed hall above the Sports Centre or the lease of more student houses\nin Evelyn Gardens. Planning permission granted\nMost other College Sports Grounds are not owned by their colleges, but belong instead to the Universities Grants Com mm it tee. However H arlington is unusual in being owned by Imperial College. The land was bought in1936 and is held in Trust by Governing Body for the Union to\nhold its various sporting activities. However, the present playing area covers only a half of the total land owned. The area to the north of Sips on Lane containing most of the pitches, the pavilion, tennis courts and carpark covers33 acres from a total of85 acres.\nSouth of the road is 18 acres of playing area and about35 acres,\nleased to a local farmer, as a market garden. Despite this, the land at present used for agricultural purposes can be claimed back at fairly short notice. The present College proposal is\nthat work should begin in1982. Planning permission has recently been granted to Henry Street er Ltd to extract gravel from50 acres adjoining the College land. The main reason for the permission was this company' s work in restoring land to full use, even for\nfood production. The outline scheme would hopefully require this land to be restored to playing field standard before any work took place on the College land. The market garden will be the first to be excavated. With an estimated three year minimum period between extraction and full restoration to sports field use, it is expected that the operation could last at least\nsix years with little disruption to College sporting life; the programme will ensure that as land is\ntaken up by the excavation, restored land becomes available for sport. Aside benefit lies in the restoration of the site. One of the most valuable commodities in London is a big hole in the ground. Building and civil engineering firms spend a great deal of money to dump inert waste close to London, and the College land at\nH arlington is conveniently near to theM4 motorway. The area is\nalso idea ll or councils to tip household refuse.\nDisruption of sports\nEven allowing for unworkable areas, the space occupied by the pavilion and other buildings and for the mineral yield being less\nthan predicted, it is forecast that the College will receive an income of atleast \u00a3 l.l million at1980 prices. Fortunately, in College we have able civil engineers and mineral resources engineers, willing to advise professionally on technical matters, such as restoration, and also on the financial matters, so it will not be necessary for College to engage a mining consultant. Although at this stage, every effort is being made to ensure minimum disruption of sports at\nH arlington, some inconvenience is\ninevitable. The present pitches are of a high standard, particularly the hockey pitches \u2014 one of which is generally considered to be among the best in the country. Even the promises of good rest oration, including the rest oral of\nexisting top soil, does not makeup for the loss of such facilities.\nHowever the sportsmen are also\nstudents and will, on the whole, welcome better provision of student residence. However it is\nimportant that a proportion of the royalties \u2014 2 0 % does not seem excessive \u2014 be specifically used for improving sports facilities at\nCollege. Such compensation seems\nfair when one looks at the state of the facilities today. Of course, it is\nvital that such monies not be squandered on day today expenditure, but is used on capital and building projects. Some of the ideas currently under consideration are closely linked with the basic gravel extraction/ student residence plan. For instance, a newhall cOuld incorporate squash court s,table tennis rooms or snooker rooms. The Sports Council has already advised that a sailing lake of10 \u2014 1 2 acres is sufficient for\ncompetitive sailing and such an area of water could be artificially created by leaving part of the site\nunfilled. Hardest hit by the proposals will be the Lawn Tennis Club. The courts at H arlington will be lost to the excavations and it is\nlikely that a newhall would be built on the present hard courts in Princes Gardens. There are also\nnumerous projects being considered at present \u2014 mainly improvements to shower and changing fac il ties. However, priorities for such projects will changeover the years; a modest guaranteed income for capital purposes will mean that the Athletics Committee will be able to plan a financial programme to bring the sports\nfacilities backup to a high standard. To conclude\nIn the present financial climate, the exploitation of the mineral assets at H arlington seems like a windfall. Imperial College has a unique opportunity to improve the housing situation of its students while maintaining, and even improving, the position of the only group likely to lose by the deal \u2014 the College sportsmen. It\nremains to be seen whether this\nopportunity is taken. Phone Nightline on 581 2468\nor Int 2468\nFELIX, October 3, 1980 Page 3\n\n"
