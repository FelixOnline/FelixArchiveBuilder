Really!? What it comes down to is which\ncandidate can get themselves known to the most\npeople in the two weeks of campaigning. They\nwill work their way round the halls and the JCR\nand turn up to as many Union events as possible,\nanything to show that they care, or is it anything\nthat will get them those extra few votes.

This means the\nelection for that post will be re-run with the\npossibility that new candidates will stand.

This\nmarks the comeback of STOIC after an\nextensive studio rebuild and extension that\ncommenced in July last year.\nThe studio now has a professional layout,\nallowing the production of informative, quality\nprogrammes on a regular basis. Delays in the relaunch have been caused by an unreliable\nnetwork system. The STOIC engineering team\nhas spent the recent months replacing 1.6\nkilometres of cable and distribution boxes in\nElectrical Engineering and Southside. STOIC\nnow sees itself free to expand its coverage to the\nparts of the campus as yet un reached. STOIC has also been active on the\nproduction side during the year. Programmes to\nbe broadcast over the next few weeks include\nSimon Says (featuring an exclusive interview\nwith Frank Bruno) next Wednesday evening,\nAbbey Road, a tour round the famous music\nstudios by their resident engineers and Carlo's Half Hour, a look at different genres of\ntelevision through the eyes of TV presenters\nsuch as Alistair Stewart, Bob Holness, William\nG Stewart, Mr Blobby and Julia Sawalha. For\nthe first time in STOIC history, network\ntelevision (Channel Four) has shown an interest\nin broadcasting some of our programmes.\nSTOIC also intends to produce a new weekly\nprogramme, STOIC LIVE, that will incorporate\nCollege and national news, film reviews and a look at what is happening around London and\nIC. Each week, the show will highlight one or\nmore clubs and societies. The Wall, another new\nshow, will be a platform for any IC student, past\nor present, to give their views on anything.\nEverything will be screened, with no deadlines,\nno censorship and no holds barred. Anyone with\na message should visit the STOIC studio one\nlunchtime to arrange a recording.\nAdditionally, STOIC has found a system\ncapable of broadcasting to the Evelyn Garden\nhalls, St Mary's Medical School and Wilson\nHouse. It works by transmitting aTV picture\nand sound on an infra-red beam over a range- of\n1.5 miles. STOIC hopes to raise the money to\ninstall this over the summer vacation.\nSTOIC can currently be seen in Da Vinci's bar and Beit Hall. Southside halls and the JCR\nwill be connected soon. The STOIC studio is\nsituated on the top floor of the Union Building.\nAnyone keen to stand for one of the Social, Cultural and Amusements Board (SCAB) positions\nshould sign up on the papers opposite the Union Office.\nSCAB is the organisation that represents the likes of FilmSoc, DramSoc, Choir and Jazz & Rock\nin the happy family that is the Union.

Imperial's A team\nfinished the weekend strongly by winning the\n'Doily Trophy' by 13 frames to 12 in a very\ncompetitive end-of-tournament match.\nThe weekend started with Imperial's Paul\nKellett grabbing the centre of attention in\nscoring breaks of 72, 59, 51 and 38 in very\nHendry-esque snooker. Both Imperial's A and B teams won their first matches, the A team going\non to win their group over Southampton and\nUEA. The B team were edged out of the first\nround group by Cardiff B by just one frame,\ndespite a good performance against Bradford.\nThe A team then went on to destroy their\nnext two opponents, Warwick and Ulster to\nreach the quarter-final stage against Cardiff A, the eventual winners. But in a petty application\nof the rules, enough to make any ice dancing\njudges envious, Imperial were penal is ed one\nframe for arriving unavoidably late. The\nquarter-final was lost on the black ball of the\nfinal frame, leaving Imperial to concentrate on a curry in Coventry and the Doily Trophy.\nRevenge is 'on the table' for next year as the\ntournament is due to be hosted by Cardiff\nUniversity.\nA team: P Kellett, V Ly, S Baugh, J Fulcher, P Wooders\nB team: B Drinkwater, A Robinson, M Sinha,\nR Godbole, N Samsatli\nStudent\nAccommodation Office\nVacancies in College Residences\nas at 7.3.94\nRef Hall Type Sex UG/PG From Licence\n1.

The tyranny, oppression and dictatorship in other parts of the\nworld, especially in the muslim world, will apparently be solved by establishing democracy in those\ncountries. Or so we are led to believe.\nDemocracy, {demos cratos - people power) since its first inception by the Greeks , has never worked\nfrom its first trial in Athens to the present day twentieth century. Then women, slaves and the poor were not\nallowed to participate in the process of decision making. In fact the system was always at loggerheads with\nitself with so many conflicting requirements, all of them impossible to meet. Today the problems are different\nbut of the same nature. In Britain we have the rule of the minority, where we have a government whom 60%\nof the electorate do not want. 80% of the people did not want the poll tax. If this is what you call democracy,\nit has failed.\nIn Islam the situation is completely different. The system it offers functioned perfectly for 1400 years\nfor everyone, regardless of race colour religion or regional location. The system is based upon giving\ncomplete sovereignty to the Creator while allowing the people the authority to elect their ruler. This is in\ncomplete contrast to democracy which gives sovereignty to the human mind, something which is weak,\nlimited, needy and dependant on its environment. For muslims this unacceptable. Democracy has and never\nwill work. None of the present governments in the muslim world rule by Islam and, as was seen in Algeria,\ndemocracy is not the way to establish the Islamic system.\nCome and hear about why Islam has an alternative system to offer over democracy, and if you truly\nbelieve in democracy then come along and present your case.\nDate : 16 MARCH 1994\nTime : 2.00 p.m. Place : MECH.

    "content": "News\nPatten's Moral\nSpeech\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nAND MARC ELLIS\nControversy is surrounding the sabbatical elections. Following the\nHustings which mark the run up to\nvoting, there is rising concern that\nstudents, especially first years, are\nstill very much in the dark about the\nelections.\nOne area that has sparked debate\nis the apparent lack of publicity for\nNew Election. The purpose of New\nElection is to allow an election to\nbe re-run if voters feel that none of\nthe proposed candidates are suitable\nfor a post. Responsibility for New\nElection publicity rests with the\nElections Committee, chaired by\nthe Returning Officer Union\nPresident, Andy Wensley. In an\ninterview with Felix he explained\nwhy the Elections Committee had\nfailed to publicise New Election: he\nadmitted deliberately underplaying\nNew Election because in his view it\nhad been used \"to rubbish can di dates\" in previous years. He added\nthat the role of New Election would\nbe made clear on flyers being\nmailed to every person eligible to\nvote. These will also include complete details on how and where to\nvote.\nDespite the promises of clear\nposters and leaflets stating the locations of voting stations, students\nhave expressed distrust in the s ys tem. Many feel that the seven voting stations set up on the South\nKensington site (reduced from a total of ten last year), will be inadequate and that this will deter people\nfrom voting. Mr Wensley attributed\nthe low number of voting stations\non the new swipe card voting s ys tem. College Security can only provide seven of the machines needed\nfor its operation. According to Mr Wensley, this number was decided\nby Rick Bilby, last year's Deputy\nPresident, but he has since suggested that at least three more machines\nare required.\nSome candidates have aired\ngrievances regarding the lack of\nproxy voting. Mr Wensley confirmed that one candidate has been\nto see him over the matter. He has\nnow stated that anyone wishing to\nvote by proxy should contact him as\nsoon as possible in the Union Office\nor on extension 3501.\nStudents need to realise the true\nvalue of a university education,\naccording to Education Secretary\nJohn Patten.\nIn what has been seen by some\nas a change of direction, Mr Patten\nsaid people should examine the\nvalue of an education rather than\nthe cost of funding it. In a lecture\non university values at King's College, London on Tuesday, he\nsaid that undergraduates have to\nrealise that university life is not a \"one way affair.\"\nHe suggested a list of morals\nwhich institutions might like to pro-mote. Those mentioned included\nregard for proper authority, sensitivity towards others' needs, fair-ness, honesty, courtesy, loyalty and\nself-respect.\nMr Patten was adamant that students need to pay attention to the\nresponsibility they have to their\nuniversities to conduct themselves\nproperly. He claimed \"It is right to\nexpect students not only to be present but to participate actively in\nseminars, attend lectures and practicals on time and hand in promptly\nwork undertaken to the best of their\nabilities.\"\nHe also stated that students had\nan obligation to the society which\nhelps to fund their courses. He\nurged all universities to introduce\nstudent 'contracts', setting out the\nstandards that learners and tutors\nexpected from each other.\nNew Constitution Delayed\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nAND LYNN BRAVEY\nThe new constitution of Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) has suffered\nfurther delays. An Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting (EGM) was held\nat 1pm on Monday to discuss and\npass the constitution document.\nHowever, the meeting was cut short\nafter just over an hour by someone\ncalling 'quorum', apparently having\ndecided that too many people had\nleft the meeting to make further discussions valid. Despite the meet-ing's poor turnout of about 70 people (clearly below the quo rate level\nof 100), Andy Wensley, ICU President has said student interest in\nthe Union is rising, due to the Union\nbeing \"a lot more professional... [and\nso] maintaining a higher profile.\"\nThe majority of points raised at\nthe EG M were on clarification of\nwording and typographical errors.\nHowever, much debate took place\non sections covering the organisation of the Union, particularly the\nre-in statement of a House Committee\nresponsible for the management of\nUnion areas in College.\nThe idea of a House Committee\nis strongly supported by Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies),\nCharlie Leary. Dismissing rumours\nthat he had threatened resigning\nover the matter, Mr Leary told\nFelix: that there was a time last term\nwhen he felt that people were\nbeginning to misinterpret exactly\nwhat his job was. Societies were\ncoming into his office with matters\nthat he felt should have been dealt\nwith by a House Committee. He\nbelieves sabbaticals should not have\nto make policy making decisions.\nHe continued by questioning the\nExecutive Committee making decisions that may seem of little or no\nimportance to them, but nevertheless are decisions that need to be\nmade. Mr Leary suggested that this\nwas where House Committee would\nstep in, with the advantage of being\nable to \"forward plan\" for certain\nsituations.\nYou can vote on Monday and Tuesday in departments\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion 21\nAerial Views\nDear Beccy,\nI read with some interest the letter from\nJames Harrow and Anthony Waite, both of\nElectrical Engineering II, in particular the\nsection with reference to a sabbatical post being\ncreated for STOIC.\nI entirely agree that a sabbatical for STOIC\nwould no doubt do wonders, and it certainly has\nenormous potential. After all, STOIC is, in their\nwords, \"...the best technically equipped studio in\nthe country.\" (presumably with the exception of\nnon- student studios?). I must also agree with\nthe ongoing anti-apathy whines, since it is\nturning into a real effort to try to get schedules\nfilled for 15 hours broadcasting every day.\nHowever, I didn't agree with the way the\namount of time and effort the entire IC Radio\ncommittee put into the station was just brushed\naside by the offhand comment \"...although IC\nRadio doesn't[ have a sabbatical], setting\nlights...for shots requires a great deal more\neffort\". I note with interest that neither Mr Waite\nnor Mr Harrow are ICR members, and hence\nhave presumably never presented a radio show,\nlet alone been involved in the station in other\ncapacities.\nI can only think they imagine that shows and\npresenters magically create themselves, and\nplaylists pop into existence at the wave of a wand; interviews with bands, liaising with\nrecord companies, ensuring that none of the\n(extensive) Radio Authority Code of\nProgramming regulations are ever contravened,\nand that playlists are adhered to for 105 out of\n168 hours every week is an easy task to do,\nsince we don't have to concern ourselves with\nthe visual medium?? (The other 63 hours being\nbetween 11pm and 8am every night.)\nIt's probably pure coincidence that most of\nthe previous station managers either failed their\ndegrees, or had them suffer to the extreme (not\nto mention the sacrifices made by some other\nDear Felix,\nThe International Tamil Society recently\npresented an exhibition of photographs to\nportray their world-wide culture and I went\nalong to this being keen to find out about\ndifferent ethnic cultures. However on going,\nalthough there were some pictures showing\nTamil dance and entertainment, importance was\nobviously being placed on a set of photographs\ndepicting suffering in Sri Lanka. Emphasis was\nplaced on two things:\n1. The tiny island of Sri Lanka and not on the\nTamil culture throughout other countries in the\nworld.\n2. Violence, rather than displaying their rich\nand varied culture.\nThis exhibition had clearly been used as a vehicle for further propaganda. Before I left a members of the committee, which are extensive\nby anyone's standards).\nIt may come as a bit of a shock to them that\ntrying to run a full time broadcasting radio\nstation is not a trivial task, and although it could\nbe debated at great length which media most\ndeserves a sabbatical post, it is not possible to\nsay outright that any one deserves such a post\nmore than another. Why not abolish the\nFe/ix/Print Unit sabbatical post in favour of a STOIC sabbatical, since (s) he only has to make\nsure Felix comes out once a week, whereas\nfilming a program is much more time\nconsuming, wouldn't you say Bee?\nNothing has been more disheartening this\nyear than to have to abandon projects, such as\nbroadcasting on FM across London for a month,\nbecause neither I nor the station committee have\nbeen able to find the amount of time for these\nprojects, since the 'mundane' day to day running\nof a radio station takes up more than a few hours\na week! I would love to see all the student media\nhave sabbatical posts, because then IC could be\na truly awesome force in the media world, and\nbe the flagship of student media. However, the\nfacts are that they don't, and money is money,\nwhich never just appears, and so we have to do\nthe best we can, with the amazing equipment we\nhave.\nWhy bicker about who's best, or who could\nbe best, when the combined efforts (like the\nhustings) always provide a high quality\nentertainment, with a greater appeal than any of\nthe media on their own could hope to achieve?\nIn the meantime, I will not sit aside and\nwatch the efforts of myself and the ICR\ncommittee be swept aside by sweeping\nstatements that, at accuracy's expense, could\ncharitably be described as misinformed.\nYours faithfully,\nJames Handley,\nI.C.

What was\nstrategically omitted from this leaflet was the\nfact that a lot of their suffering is caused by the\nTamil terrorist organisation who force young\nboys to join them and kill them if they refuse;\nwho do not allow people to leave them and also\nuse innocent civilians as human shields.\nI was disturbed by the undercurrent of\nvenomous feeling running through this\nexhibition and think that the Social Clubs\nCommittee should think very carefully before\nauthor ising such displays of negative images in\nthe future.\nThese are the view of the Sri Lankan Society\nof Imperial College.\nRefreshing\nDear Felix,\nCongratulations on the article printed on 4th March '94 titled ' An Independent Thinker'.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 11\nThe IC Festival of Drama\nLight is tentatively breaking over a not too\ndistant horizon and let me be the first to herald\nits re-emergence. A leaner, keener Dramatic\nSociety, d is burdened of ranc our, welcomes one\nand all to participate in The Imperial College\nFestival of Drama. This unique celebration is a spontaneous response to overwhelming enthusiasm on the part of IC Dramatic Society\nmembers and a blossoming, burgeoning group of\nstudents, for realising an participating in drama,\nwithin or without the theatre.\nThere are four faces to the festival. Already\nrecorded is a radio play by Tom Stoppard.\nDirected by Ed Mulligan, The Dog It Was That\nDied is an ingenious satire on the precious and\nperplexing game of international espionage. The\nbroadcast on IC Radio, 20th March, promises to\nbe an hilarious event.\nIn the final week of term (22nd to 24th March) we present a daring re-examination of\nT.S. Eliot's intriguing verse-drama Murder In\nThe Cathedral, directed by Asghar Khan.\nDispense with any pre-conceptions and be\nprepared to be shocked...\nForming the bulk of the programme and\nbeing performed on alternate nights in the week\nbeginning 14th March are plays by two of this\ncenturies most enigmatic writers. Dylan Thomas\nemploys the sensuous irony and subtle insight\nfamiliar from his poetry, in this adaptation of\nThe Doctor and the Devils. The exhaustive\nefforts of director Phill Henry and his committed\ncast should ensure a rivetting evening.\nLast, and perhaps most peculiar of all, is a masterpiece of theatre created in the compelling\nmind of Eugene Ionesco. Exit The King portrays\nthe final, desperate struggle of Man confronted\nwith his mortality. Reason rebels and the\nplaywright constructs a hugely elaborate and\ninsanely humourous response to a tragedy that\nbegins the moment we scream our way into the\nlight. The work has provided cast, crew and\ndirector, Phil Ramsden, with a tremendous\nchallenge and opportunity to communicate a shattering ly powerful statement. There are plans\nto tour with this production to Paris, Edinburgh\nand Geneva - so spare yourself the expense and\nsee it while it's on near you!\nIn addition to the naked attraction of the\nabove purely as a banquet of high art, we are\nalso providing concessions on the prices of\nseeing the two shows in the Concert Hall when\npurchasing a dual ticket, while the Eliot, being\nplayed in the Lounge Bar (opposite Da Vinci's Bar), is absolutely and unashamedly free\\\nI hope you can support this event, which\npromises to be a very special occasion indeed.\nTo miss it would be to disregard a significant\nepisode in the history of student theatre; I urge\nyou not to make that mistake!\nP.S. Anyone still interested in performing in\nour shows in Edinburgh, there are still a few\nspaces left. Get in touch with Jim Kingston\n(Physics 2) as soon as possible.\nHorrifically Weird Scissors\nHorror and weirdness. Monday's ICSF video\nprojected double bill begins in Chem Eng LT1 at\n6pm with Dario Argento's overblown gothic\nclassic Suspiria. Set in a German ballet school\nwith maggots in the attic and witches in the\ncommon room, Argento goes way over the top\nwith his relish for disposing of beautiful women\nin grotesquely inventive manners. Excess piles\non excess, making other gore films pale by\ncomparison. Not for the squeamish.\nThe strangeness begins at 8pm with David\nLynch's second short, The Grandmother. This is\nthe tale of a young bed wetter who grows a grandmother to comfort him from a seed. Not\nquite as odd as his first short, The Alphabet, but\nit still out weird s everything else. If you liked\nEraserhead, come along to this one. Both f dms are free to ICSF members, details given below.\nAfter these two gems, at 8.30pm we're\nholding our Annual General Meeting. If you\nwant to stand for an ICSF committee post for\nnext year, come along and tell us why we should\nvote for you.\nThis coming Tuesday night, in the STOIC\nstudio, ICSF is proud to present a heartwarming\nfantasy double-bill which I should've scheduled\nfor Valentine's Day but didn't. At 6pm, we have\nflavour-of-the-year Steven Spielberg's rather\nsweet and unfortunately overlooked romance,\nAlways. Starring Spielberg-regular Richard\nDreyfuss, Oscar-favourite Holly Hunter and\neveryone's best friend John Goodman, the\nmovie tells a similar story to Ghost. When\nDreyfuss dies while saving his best mate\nGoodman's life, he realises how much his\ngirlfriend, to whom he's unable to talk directly,\nmeans to him. When he gets sent back to Earth\nas a ghost to inspire the thoughts of a young\nrookie, he is horrified to discover that the\nyoungster has designs on his ex-girl and is\nforced to give up his own feelings for her. It's really good, so turn up and see it (details below).\nAt 8pm, we have Tim Burton's bittersweet\nfairy-tale Edward Scissorhands. You all know\nthe story - a retelling of Frankenstein with\nJohnny Depp as the sympathetic leather clad\nmonster and Winona Ryder unfortunately not\nleather clad as the object of his affections.\nAnyway, Winona Ryder's fab (and her acting\nisn't bad either) and so's Johnny Depp. The\nmusic's terrific, as are the sets, which are a perfect pastel mickey-take of 50s American\nsuburbia. With an ending that can make all but\nthe most hardened, cold, frigid, emotion-less\nbastards (yes, I know there are a lot of you out\nthere) cry, Edward Scissorhands would be a perfect 'date' movie.\nAdmission to both is free if you're a member\nof STOIC, JapanSoc or ICSF. ICSF membership\ncosts just \u00a33 and gets you in free to all our video\nscreenings along with reduced entry to our\n35mm presentations in the cinema including\nyour first film free. You also get to borrow\n3,000 books, videos and graphic novels (from\nour library in the corner of Beit Quad).\nAdventure\nHoliday Prize!\nWould you like to go on an adventure holiday or\neven travel to Egypt for/ree? If so, take part in\nthe WWF Juggleathon on Saturday 12th March.\nOther Rags will be taking part as well and the\nRag raising the most money for WWF this year\nwins ten places on an adventure holiday.\nCurrently we are in second place, \u00a328 behind\nKeele so we stand a good chance of winning.\nAlso, all collectors have a chance to win a trip\nto Egypt, as their names will be entered into the\nGrand Draw with this as the first prize. The draw\nwill take place at the party for all collectors.\nFor those of you seeking more adventurous\nactivities we are planning a sponsored parachute\njump for next term. If leaping out of a plane\nappeals to you, come and see Jane, Helen or\nMike in the Rag Office or attend one of our\nFriday lunchtime meetings.\nOn a more serious note - the Rag Executive\nelections are upon us and we need people to\nstand for Rag Chair, Secretary and Treasurer.\nThe elections will take place at our meeting\ntoday (l pm, Ents Lounge). The Chair will be\nratified at the U GM on the 18th March as it is a Union post. If you want to stand for any of these\nposts or any of the other positions on the\ncommittee then see Jane, Helen or any of the\ncommittee before the meeting and we'll give\nyou more information about what the posts\ninvolve.\nRegular society meetings are listed on the centre pages\n\n"

    "content": "18 Elections\nIC Radio\nInterviews\nFor those of you unable to hear IC Radio last\nMonday, what follows is edited highlights of the\ninterviews of the election candidates. They took\nthe form of questions from an interviewer, so the\nlack of a mention of a particular topic by any\ncandidate is not necessarily an indication of a lack of interest.\nPresident\nInterviewer: Paul Dias (ICR News Editor)\nKamran Bashir came across confidently,\nthough often a little slow and perhaps boring. He\nindicated that he saw part of the role of\nrepresentatives on Union committees as being to\ninform the students of Union activities.\nHe said that he doesn't believe apathy actually\nexists and getting people involved is simply a matter of providing the students with what they\nwant, which he assumes is top-of-the-range club\nevents.\nKamran believes the President should go out\nand talk to fresher s and \"give them a push in the\nright direction\", telling them there's more to life\nthan IC and to find out what UL U was like. He\nthought that this would have a knock-on effect\nwith most of the people from other colleges\ncoming to the suggested events at IC.\nThe next candidate was Lucy Chothia who came\nacross very confidently, albeit with occasional\nhesitation. She reasoned that apathetic students\ncan't be expected to become interested in\nanything about the Union if they're not told\nwhat's happening.\nLucy said she wanted to clarify and improve\nthe situation between ICU and the CCUs,\nincluding St Mary's to this extent she has\nalready talked to the C CU Presidents who she said\nwere \"very keen\" on the idea. She said that she\nsought clarification of the Union hierarchy and not\nsimplification as stated in her manifesto. She said\nthat \"people after the last two years are tired of not\nbeing able to work in a defined [constitutional]\nstructure\" and that she \"would take whatever was\ndecided this year and make it work\".\nThe interview concluded with Lucy discussing\nhow she would raise the President's profile and\nget people to know who she is and what she does.\nHow To Vote( A Photo Story) The final candidate was Paul Thomas who\ncame across as very together and comfortable, if\nalmost too casual. He commented that, while the\nStudent Representative Council will be good for\nthe Union, the real way forward in improving\ncommunication lies in getting the idea over to\neveryone that they are involved in the Union\nalready through their clubs and societies.\nOn a similar vein, he said that he would try to\nmake himself more accessible in places where\nthe students were, such as Southside Halls and\nthe JCR. He said that the President should have a wide ranging view of what's happening in the\nUnion and would be able to either give\ncomments to people on the spot, or get back to\nthem on any other point.\nHis interview concluded with his adamant\ndenial that just because he'd been involved with\nthe Union for so long it meant he didn't have\nfresh and new ideas.\nNew Election is also standing.\nDeputy President (Finance\n& Services)\nInterviewer: Declan Curry\nFirst was Tim Brown, who stumbled his way\nthrough the hard-hitting questioning. He admitted\nthat the job is \"terribly boring and not intrinsically\ninteresting\", saying: \"You chair the Union Finance\nCommittee...the meetings are just very long...\nsometimes...the argument is very repetitive...you\nnod in agreement.\" He professed to being wary\nof change as it wastes a lot of time and effort.\nThe tack then changed to his policy on bank\ncharges which he felt were far too high at\npresent, saying that he would first approach\nNatWest (the Union's current bank) and, if the\nresult was unsatisfactory, try some alternatives\nused by other universities.\nDan Look, the next candidate, came to the\nmicrophone like a horserace commentator, often\ntoo fast to keep up with, but confident in his own\nviews. He started by rebuffing Tim on the bank\ncharge issue saying that he thought \"people were\nbeing too hasty\".\nHe admitted that he found the prospect of the\n\u00a3ViM Union sub vent ion \"frightening\" but also\ncommented that \"EViM is a lot of money and it is\nbound to scare people...for your average student\nwho is getting \u00a33,000 a year, \u00a3ViM you can\nhardly comprehend\".\nHe said he also looked upon it \"as a personal\n1 . Find your nearest voting station challenge... as the money has to be spent wisely\".\nSecurity, he felt, was in no need of change at\npresent and his personal touch was that he\nwanted more openness with the money, not\nrealising that it was part of his job anyway.\nNew Election is also standing.\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties)\nInterviewer: Andrew Tseng\nMark Baylis instantly defended the short length\nof his manifesto by taking great lengths (of very\nlong stammered sentences) to make his points.\nAs in his manifesto he said that having run\none club meant he understood the way that clubs\nwere run. After some pushing, he then admitted\nthat he still had to learn \"to a degree\" what he\ncould and couldn't do in the job.\nThe interview then centred on apparent\nproposals according to Mark to \"replace the\nsports facilities\". He did point out that he had a \"distinct insight\" into the present problems due to\nbeing a captain in the badminton club, one of the\nfew clubs involved in this specific problem.\nNext was Maria Moratis who came across as\nbeing full of opinions, but she had some trouble\nexpressing. She said that people don't know\nenough about the positive achievements of\nsocieties and that \"they should be publicised in a more active way\", the suggestion being \"maybe\nhuge posters around College\".\nShe pointed out that ICU has huge overseas\nsocieties and \"there should be more integrated\nevents so that you expose all this immense\namount of different culture to everybody else\".\nIan Parish came across as the clearly, speaking\nconfidently though diplomatically. He said that,\nin general, sponsorship should be for specific\nclubs, though he would also seek sponsorship for\nICU in general to benefit all societies.\nThe interviewer finished by trying to draw Ian\non his supposed knowledge of the proposed\nsports hall, without realising that it was already a point in his manifesto.\nNew Election is also standing.\nDue to space restrictions, the Felix Editor &\nPrint Unit Manager candidate interviews could\nnot be included. Fuller transcripts of all these\ninterviews are available from the Felix Office.\n2 . Handover your swipe card "

    "content": "16 Interview\nBlossoms from the Full Moon\nIf Woody Allen painted his Manhattan in the grime of grey and Warhol's Underground were pillars of black, New Yorkers Madder Rose have their\nown tint. Tintin saw flashes of Koda chrome... Madder Rose have been up since eight o 'clock\nby the time I get to see them. Enduring ten hours\nof press adulation, photo shoots, dissected\nhistories, drug ridden memories. The reason?\nWell, they're presently on tour with a second\nalbum out at the end of the month, their first,\n'Bring It Down', being one of the critics' top ten\nof 1993.\nStrange to tell, but as I sit down in the void of\nthe interview's first few minutes and look\naround, we've been put into the cruddiest room\nin the Astoria: cracked primrose walls and an en\nsuite bathroom which Mary is just coming out\nof. That the wash basin is above where I'm sitting causes more embarrassment as polite\n'excuse mes' need to be made. She dries her\nhands and sits down. Why do I tell you this?\nBecause interviews are not what you often read,\nthey can be messy, to start with at least. Four\npeople in an enclosed space, trying to work out\nif they will get on with each other.\nBilly sits sprawled in a chair, relaxed or just\nbored? Johnny Kick is still wearing his hat. Does\nhe ever take it off? I never ask the question.\nMary goes to sit on a battered sofa and looks\npretty nervous, or is that just pretty? She has the\nsort of face that brings both qualities together.\nI'm supposed to be in control of this\ninterview, the band are there on my behalf at\nleast. So I start off with some easy banter for\nthem. Press acclaim, comparisons with Mazzy\nStar - Billy loves them, Mary not so much, \"it's a very surf a cy comparison\" - and the preview\ntracks I 've heard from their new album. In the\nmeantime, Johnny's been reading an old copy of\nFELiX which reviewed one of their gigs. He\npasses it to Billy who explodes: \"Who wrote this\nf*** ing thing?\" It's are not looking good as the\n'writer' is only a fist's throw away. I try not to\nlook too worried and mutter about student\nreviewers, not mentioning myself or anything.\nMary wants it all read out, \"Wow\" she shouts,\n\"let me see that\". Billy eventually says, \"It's kinda funny though\" and I take the opportunity\nto escape and talk to Johnny about the band\ndynamics with Billy and Mary doing all the\nupfront stuff. He talks in a slow, strong drawl.\n\" Billy will bring a song and play it on\nacoustic. We'll arrange it together; we get\ninput...\" Billy interrupts with his own input.\n\"Once a song is done we've found it's really\ncool just to play it on acoustic guitar and let\neveryone kinda create their own part and that's been working out really well for us and the\nband's really a democracy; no-one's more\npowerful than the other. I mean, if someone\ndoesn't want to do something or play something\nthen we don't do it, so it's equal, it's cool.\"\nBy this stage Mary has finally got to the end\nof my review and reads out, \"...two drummers,\nMary, Johnny Kick, Billy and Matt stand in a rubbish tip and try not to say cheese.\nwho did they think they were, Pavement?\" She\nlaughs and I can feel like laughing too.\nWe head into more conventional territory. I ask Billy whether his songs come from real\nexperiences or are 'made up'? \"Well they're all\nbased on things I 've lived through or things I feel, but some of the lines or situations maybe\nmade up to fit the thought behind it, you know,\nbut they're fairly personal.\"\n...that whole summer I sat on the edge ofthe\nstage and just wanted\nso bad to be in a band\nlike I could taste it.\nDespite some intensive listening before the\ninterview, I confess that I don't really\nunderstand what most of the songs are about.\nFor example, was 'Beautiful John' about Andy\nWarhol, someone Billy knew from days at the\nFactory?\n\"No, no. It's about someone, you remember\nthe period when he was making movies like\n'Trash' and 'Flesh'?\" I nod unconvincingly. \"I think the real guy I was thinking about was Joe\nDallesandro, the star of those movies, with long\nblond hair, or someone like him, someone who\nwas popular mainly because he was this\nbeautiful man and sh*t and I was wondering\nwhat it would be like years later when he was\nolder and no-one gave a sh*t about him.\"\nClicking back into mu so mode I ask whether\nthey had written any songs too personal to be\nreleased, a point particularly brought out of an\nexcellent Kristin Hersh interview in Melody\nMaker, something Mary had also read. \"I have a couple like that you do too actually,\" she says to\nBilly. He's not sure what songs are too personal\nand Mary has to tell him. \"I was thinking of the\none that goes...\" and then she start singing in her\nquiet, comfortable voice. \"Hush little baby,\ndon't say a word...you know that one...we got\nthings to do, gonna do things tonight.\" Billy\nremembers. \"Oh yes, the only reason I don't want us to play that is the first line is 'the first\nthing I wake up I think of Mary' - this is before\nI met Mary but it seems kinda silly coming out\nof Mary's mouth.\" \"But it's true\", butts in Mary,\nwith a big smile. \"If I were singing it, it would\nbe true.\" At this point the room breaks into\ngeneral laughter as they consider what other\nnames could be used instead of Mary. Larry and\nHarry are thrown around for a bit.\nWe end talking about how weird it is to have\nhad musical heroes like Sonic Youth and the\nVelvet Underground now that they have become\nheroes themselves. Mary says: \"It's an\nincredible thing and to have that happen in such\na short space of time...I mean I remember just\nwhen I was a sorta roadie for Yo La Tengo one\nsummer, and that whole summer I sat on the\nedge of the stage and just wanted so bad to be in\na band like I could taste it. And that was only\nthree and a half years ago.\" I comment how\ngood Yo LA Tengo's last album, 'Painless', was.\nThere's agreement of greatness.\nMary tells me to get their first album and\n'Faith Book'. \"Any record by them actually is\ngreat. They were a big influence on us,\" Billy\ncontinues. \"Big, big influence, they were great.\nPut on a great live show, they're great\nsongwriters, everything about them.\" The Roses\nwax lyrical. \"Yes, there's nothing wrong with\nthem.\" Mary finishes laughing, \"they're perfect!\"\nSo they finish arguing the majesty of another\nband. They're still enthusiasts themselves. In the\npast music has made their guts swoon and in\nturn, they are producing songs which we can cry\nand dance to. Later that evening on stage\nMadder Rose kick the crowd out of shape. I look\non and think how good it can be.\nThe single 'Panic On' is released on March\n14th, and an album of the same title on the 28th. They also play the Astoria on April the 9th.I think of you all today long so try and get some sleep\n\n"

What could this mean?\nThe inclusion of a question mark in a clue\nmight be significant. I used to think it was an\nadmission that the clue was crap but I'll acknowledge there are times when it has its\nuses. Firstly, it could just be a red herring put in\nto make the clue read better:\n1. Was Edward killed? (6)\nAnother use of the question mark is when the\nstraightforward definition of the clue is not so\nstraightforward after all. Specifically if the\nanswer to a clue was BIRD the straightforward\ndefinition might be 'swallow' (adequately\ndeceptive). However, you could justly argue\nthat 'swallow' is not a definition of a bird,\nrather it is an example. Therefore the clue\nshould reflect this and a question mark comes\nin very handy here:\nFind the heads of Brazilian iguanas really\ndifficult to swallow? (4)\n[See lesson 11]\nSo here the question mark reflects that a swallow is an example of a bird and not another\nname for the bird genus. In this type of example\nthe question mark could be replaced by words\nsuch as 'maybe' or 'perhaps'.\nAnother use of the question mark is to\naccompany a quirky definition. These clues\nmay not contain two wholly independent\nmethods for getting the answer unlike all those\ndiscussed previously. They will often be written\nfor phrases:\n2. Hereditary diarrhoea? (4,2,3,6)\n3. Will you find a camper here? (6)\n4. Grumpy tells how he made a more\nmalleable steel? (5-8)\n5. Tricked by one's chauffeur? (5,3,1,4)\n6. Have second thoughts about the by-pass\noperation? (6,2,5)\n7. Popeye the com pere?(63)8.A substitute for shoes? (5-2)\n9. How fashions change annually, perhaps\n(4,2,4,3)\n10. Umpire's decision? Come off it! (4,4)\nYou can probably see how the question mark\ncleans up any unconventional aspects of the\nclue.\nLesson 14. Oh yeah!\nWhat of the exclamation mark? This, too, I used to think was a cop-out for a poor clue. I still think this. Well it's usually used to mark a clue which the compiler considers to work\nrather well, rah-rah.\nThis lesson, however, is not about the\nexclamation mark. It is about a type of clue\nunlike any other - some call it the 'click!' or the\n'oh yeah!' clue. This genre only has one part to\nthe clue i.e. not a straightforward and a cryptic\ncomponent. They might be accompanied by an\nexclamation mark to indicate that they are a little unconventional (as with the question\nmark).\nIf you try these examples you could be put\noff for they might seem a little unfair. Not so,\nbecause, in a crossword, you can always leave\nthem until you have got some cross-referenced\nletters and that, after all, is what makes\ncrosswords so inherently easy.\n11. Study-form (10)\n12. Huge surfer! (5,4)\n13. The main debris (7)\n14. A good read? (5)\n15. Light relief? (8)\n16. Senseless velocity! (5)\n17. Speaker is on course here, maybe (8)\n18.

    "content": "Feature\nsixties, he went hungry in order to be able to\nafford an orchestral score of Lulu. \"I think Berg\nis one of the greatest masters of the twentieth\ncentury...I mean ever, really. And his style has\nalways appealed to me tremendously. It's a very\nlyrical style, but it's very complex emotionally,\nwhich is what I like about it. There's a lot of\nirony in the music, there's a lot of humour\u2014\nvery black of course\u2014and there's a deep sort of\nmelancholy...It's interesting, there's a sense in\nwhich Berg's music and Elgar's music, for\ninstance the Second Symphony, are not so far\napart. They both look at the world with rather a sense of catastrophe I think; a lot of compassion,\nbut with a lot of disillusionment. And, of course,\nLulu is absolutely that, because by the end of the\npiece one is disillusioned with Lulu and all the\nmen around her and the whole awful business of\nsexual attraction. But at the same time, in spite\nof all the degradation she goes through, at the\nend the sense that one has is of an awful loss and\nan awful waste of something beautiful and pure\nand vibrant.\"\nAfter the success of Davis's Berg weekend at\nthe Barbican two years ago and with the\n'Towards The Millenium' series having reached\nthe Thirties, the time seemed right for the\nfulfilment of a long-held ambition. \"I 've been\ndying to do Lulu for\nyears and years. The\nBerg weekend..., you\nknow, I had more fun\nthan should be legal\ndoing that!\" Despite\ntheir well-received\nWozzeck, the English\nNational Opera have\nyet to commit\nthemselves to a production of the\ncomplete Lulu and so it is not since the Covent\nGarden revival of 1983 that London has heard\nthe finished opera. \"Wozzeck is easier to put on.\nIt's a much easier opera to cast. If you've got a good baritone to do Wozzeck then you can cast\nthe rest fairly easily, whereas Lulu...The title\nrole of course, almost no-one in the world can\nsing it at any given time. And some of the other\nroles are hard\u2014Alwa's a very hard role. But it's mainly finding a Lulu, that's the biggest\nproblem.\"\nFor these two concert performances, Lulu is\nsung by Patricia Wise, today's pre-eminent\ninterpreter of the part. \"It's probably the longest\nrole that I sing,\" she says, \"except for Susanna in\nMozart's Marriage of Figaro, which certainly\ncan't be compared, because the do dec a ph on al music is much harder to learn. Also the many,\nmany scene changes and the character\ndevelopment of Lulu demand a lot of\nconcentration just to remember which door\nyou're going out of and which costume you're\ncoming back on wearing!\" This will be less of a problem in a concert performance, although\nthere are plans to do a minimal staging,\nincluding entrances and exits for the singers.\nThere will also be super titles, but unfortunately\nthere will not be the film scene specified by\nBerg to depict Lulu's imprisonment and escape\nafter she has murdered her third husband, Dr\nSchon. This pivotal event, the mid-point of the\n..the lament sung by the\ndying Countess over\nLulu's body makes one\nof the most moving\nendings in all opera.\nopera, marks the beginning of Lulu's decline.\n\"One should almost think that Lulu has, in a way, staged her whole rise and fall and that she\nis practically going back to that great beyond\nfrom which she came. So this makes her a very\ninteresting character in that she's almost not\nhuman,\" says Wise,\nrecalling the title of\nWedekind's first Lulu\nplay, Earth Spirit.\nThe complexities of\nthe plot are matched by\nthe intricacies of the\nmusic's construction.\nAndrew Davis believes\nthat any interpreter of\nLulu has to be aware of\nthe many important musical interrelationships in\norder to bring them out as clearly as possible.\nHowever complicated the technical means,\nthough, the end results are very clear in what\nthey reveal about the characters. \"You always\nfeel there's some sort of magic with Berg,\" he\nsays. \" You know, he decided to take every\nseventh note of the Lulu series and came up with\nthis theme for Aiwa, which is so lyrical and\nself-indulgent and morbid. Of course, it's what\nhe does with the basic intervals...But for Dr\nSchon you have this\nseries starting with a major triad, second\ninversion, and it speaks\nof such a strong\npersonality before you do\nanything with it.\"\nThe other principal\ncharacter is Countess\nGeschwitz, whose love\nfor Lulu goes completely\nunrequited. Wedekind\nwas one of the first playwrights to create a major\ncharacter with lesbian tendencies, and his\nsympathetic portrayal of the Countess will surely\nhave appealed to Berg, whose sister was a lesbian. \"Geschwitz is a very sensitive character,\nand a sad character, but a very beautiful person,\"\nexplains Davis. \"The whole opening of the\nsecond act is such a wonderful new world, and\nthe music is completely dominated by\nGeschwitz and you can\nalmost smell it, like the\nmusic is a reflection of\nthe orchids that she's brought Lulu.\"\nBerg's ingenious\nuse of his leitmotiv ic material is a source of\ncontinued fascination\nfor Davis: \"You're\nalways finding new subtleties, new cross-references.\" Some of these cross-references\nserve to make powerful dramatic points. \"There\nare a lot of correspondences where music comes\nback, sometimes at radically different tempos; a lot of Act II scene ii is exactly twice as slow as\nthe same music in Act II scene (', which is\ndeliberate. Lulu comes in from hospital, she's sick, so everything is moving in this strange\ndream world.\" There follows the rapturous\nconsummation of Alwa's love for Lulu (but with\nalchemy, transformed\nWedekind's trite ditty\nfirst into gold and then\ninto lead.\na ghoulish twist at the end, as Lulu remarks,\n\"isn't this the couch where your father [Dr\nSchon] bled to death?\") This wonderful and very\napproachable section is one of many memorable\npassages. \"There are lyric moments which are\nactually very, very beautiful,\" says Wise. \"The\nduets with Schon are\nBerg haS, by SOme aCt Ofvery gratifying, and t two duets with A iwa are also very lyric.\"\n\"It's the piece that\nadheres most closely to\nSchoenbergian principles of twelve-note\ncomposition,\" says\nDavis, \"and yet it's his\nmost tonal in some\nways, it and the Violin Concerto. There's all this\nwonderful dance music\u2014the English waltz,\nwhich is quite like some of the music in the\nViolin Concerto; it's the same slightly\nover-civilised world of the dance hall.\" There\nare jazz influences too, with a prominent part,\nboth blowsy and yearning, for alto saxophone.\n\"And he uses Wedekind's lau ten lied in a very\nimportant way and integrates it so cleverly with\nhis own style.\" In particular, after the\nextraordinarily powerful transition between\nscenes i and ii of Act III, the curtain rises on a run-down garret and an off-stage wind band\nperfectly captures the drab, washed-out\natmosphere of a grey, rainy evening. Incredibly,\nthe tune is the same as in the preceding\ninterlude; Berg has, by some act of alchemy,\ntransformed Wedekind's trite ditty first into\ngold, and then into lead.\nIn black and white on the page of the libretto,\nthe closing scene is grim and sordid. Lulu's third\nclient is Jack the Ripper, played by the same\nperformer who has sung the role of Schon. He\nstabs both Lulu and the Countess to death. Yet\nBerg avoids lurid melodrama through the depth\nand feeling of his music; the lament sung by the\ndying Countess over Lulu's body makes one of\nthe most moving endings in all opera. Davis\nfeels that both of Berg's operas transcend their\noriginals. \"With Lulu, at the end of the opera\nyou do have this incredible love for this\nextraordinary woman, I think. You can't help\nloving what she\nrepresents and cherishing\nwhat she represents and\nmourning in a very\nprofound way that it's gone. And yet analysing\nit, you look at the libretto\nand you think, well, isn't this a little whore? But it\nisn't, and that's the\nessence...And that's where a lot of productions\nof Lulu, several that I 've seen, fail completely, I think, because they don't understand Lulu's inherent purity.\"\nAndrew Davis conducts and Patricia Wise sings\nthe title role, in concert performances o/ Lulu at\nthe Royal Festival Hall on 11th March and at\nSymphony Hall, Birmingham on 13th March,\nstarting at 6.30 pm.\n.an off-stage wind band\nperfectly captures the\ndrab, washed-out\natmosphere of a grey,\nrainy evening.\nSee page 4 for a vision of the future of Europe\n\n"

Come, let us fly across the world in a blur of pictures... Global Buzz: Owain Bennallack Postcardsfrom Paradise: Ivan Chan\nWow the world has come to us and many of us\ndon't seem to care. At once Ifelt very lonely, the\nworld seemed very big. Everyone should be in a minority sometimes.'\nSo I ended a column on International Nite\nlast year, lambasting the absence of home\nstudents from the proceedings. This year there\nwere, perhaps, a few more. But regardless, in\nthe interim an obvious truth has dawned. There\nare x tickets and y countries on that stage. That\nmeans roughly x/y tickets per affiliated and\nhomesick student. So there isn't that much room\nfor the rest of us! A shame, because this really is\nthe high-night of the College event calender.\nI feel a buzz when I arrive at six o 'clock. It's the buzz of a College partying, letting its hair\ndown. We are here to smile, laugh and butcher\nanyone who stands between us and the last\nportion of Kway Teow Goreng. I try that\nmyself, also hitting the Japanese stall and, with\na ticket plundered from an absent friend, circle\nthe Iranian buffet. It was truly gorgeous. That\nleft a spare food coupon but unfortunately I'd misplaced that spare ticket! Contented gluttony\nturned to stomach-turning panic when I considered the absent friend's arrival for the\ncultural show where, meeting me ticket less, she\nwould undoubtedly put on a show of her own in\nthe Sherfield Building foyer (castrato anyone?).\nLuckily, a wonderful Singaporean stall helper\nfound it in a sorry brown state at the bottom of\nhis box. Relieved, I almost knocked over the\nGoreng in my efforts to culturally bond with him!\nEveryone I spoke to described the food as\n'brilliant' except a chap called Tai who only got\na chance to use one coupon. He admits that the\nfood he tried was 'brilliant' - friend, the Food\nFair is like an exam, you have to learn to cram!\nPick your country, cheer your flag...\nSitting pretty.\n\"You have to be here really quickly because\nwhen everybody arrived - v oom everyone\nhits the best stalls straight away...when I got to\nthe Japanese stall there was just tumbleweed\nflying by...\" Tim Parsons, Aeronautics PG\nDo you get an opportunity to try out food\nfrom the other stalls?\n\"Yes of course! We get a chance before the\nmain fair opens...\" The Lebanese Stall Helpers\nWhat about cultural promotion? \"It's merely for having fun...it might\ndepend on the individuals themselves, rather\nthan general ising to say that everyone will\nthink of it as something greater.\"\nKavah Jhayour, Aero\n\"The Food Fair has gone extremely well - it\nexceeded all our expectations.\" Mark Sin, OSC\nThe Dance Club provide us with that perfect Kodak moment.

    "content": "Feature 5\nA Stranger in our Midst\nMarcus Alexander looks back in time from the heights of the Queen's Tower\nThe Imperial Institute. Who is that cheeky time traveller in the top left':\nEverybody's seen it, some have even been to the\ntop of it, but nobody seems to know why it's there. The Queen's Tower is famous within\nImperial College for being the only remotely\nattractive building in College (apart from the\nRCM), it's emblazoned across the cover of every\nprospectus and yet for years it has stood empty.\nSo why is it there at all? It turns out that the\nTower was originally part of something far\ngreater. It was the central feature of the Imperial\nInstitute, a vast building commissioned to mark\nQueen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887.\nThe Institute was to be the spiritual heart of\nthat long dead institution, the British Empire.\nContaining libraries, laboratories and museum\nrooms, it was a gross celebration of Imperial\npower. The building itself was over 210 metres\nlong, a fantastic neo-Rennaisance construction\nwith the Tower rising from the centre, flanked at\neither end by smaller, supplementary towers.\nWith the Tower making it one of the tallest\nbuildings in London, it stood proudly at the heart\nof the city and the heart of the Empire, watching\nover its progeny with an omniscient eye.\nThe Imperial Institute was just part of the\nimmense vision of Prince Albert. Using the\nmoney raised by the Great Exhibition of 1851,\nhe created the South Kensington of today by\ncommissioning the Science and Natural History\nMuseums, the Victoria & Albert and the\nforerunners of Imperial College. His dream was\nto 'improve the progress of Human Development' by creating a centre of aesthetic and\ncultural learning in London. (It is a sad irony\nthat students at the modern Imperial College\nhave so little interest in the aesthetic learning).\nSo the Tower stood at the centre of this\nmonument to British rule. From its 87 metre\nhigh peak the whole of London could be seen,\neven landmarks up to twenty miles away.\nHowever, its glory was short lived. The Empire\nbegan to crumble and the Institute was not\nprofitable. Much of the building was taken over\nby the University of London in 1902 and other\ninstitutions used it later on. Meanwhile, Imperial\nCollege was born and it was hungry for space.\nIn 1957, the Government committed architectural sacrilege by ordering that the fantastic\nInstitute building should be destroyed. The site\nwas needed for the monolithic steel frames of\nthe new Imperial College buildings. The ensuing\nuproar was so great that they eventually decided\nto keep the Tower. Over a space of two years, the\nCivil Engineering department worked to make\nthe Tower stand on its own, by rebuilding the\nlower half and installing massive foundations.\nThe dying embers of the Imperial Institute\nbecame the Commonwealth Institute and moved\nto Holland Park, along with two of the stone lions.\nThe Tower now stands somewhat in cong rou sly in the indifferent heart of College, a symbol of the academic achievements around it.\nIt is empty and locked to prevent over stressed students from temptation. It seems irrelevant\nnow, its past forgotten along with the remains of\nthe Empire it represented. A few renegades from\nthe Mountaineering Club have suggested turning\nit into a climbing wall but, apart from that, the\ntower remains largely ignored.\nHowever, for a few weeks at least, the\nQueen's Tower is experiencing rebirth. Once an\nemblem of power, more recently one of science,\nthe Tower has become a work of art. Various\nartists have been asked to draw their inspiration\nfrom the architecture and history of South\nKensington in an exhibition designed to bring art\nout of the gallery and onto the street. Organised\nby the Royal College of Art, it will exist in the\narea around Imperial College throughout March,\ngiving us a once in a lifetime chance to receive\nthat much needed dose of aesthetic learning\nwithout having to walk for more than five minutes.\nIn creating the exhibition, the Albert\nMemorial (or rather its scaffolding) has been\nutilised, a Saracen personnel carrier is now\nsitting outside the RCA and a 'diplomatic car' is\nroving the streets. This mutating machine will be\nboth seen and heard as it cruises past the 24\nembassies in the area, playing each nations'\nmusic in turn. For those who dare to venture\ninside the RCA itself, they will be able to\nexpress their opinions on a giant video system,\nor just write them on the wall. The artists have\nbeen using up-to-the-minute technology to\nexpress the modern paranoia about surveillance,\nterrorism and Big-Brother. Video, sound and\nmilitary hardware have all become valid media\nfor this most modern of modern art.\nFor the highlight of the show, I braved the\nfreezing sleet to pay a visit to the Tower itself.\nAt the very top protrude four video cameras.\nTheir appearance had been so subtle that they\ncould have been placed there by College\nSecurity to keep a beady eye on us. I found the\ndoor open. Inside were four screens, suspended\nfrom the distant roof of the tower, showing the\nview from each camera. The effect is disconcerting and vertiginous, the feeling of staring\nup and at once looking down from an impossible\nheight. Huddled behind a radiator was Anne\nEggebert herself, the artist...\nHer path of discovery seemed analogous to\nmy own. The might of the old Institute and its\nshocking aims, which included 'the furtherance\nof systematic colonisation', inspired the idea of\nusing the Tower as a symbol of power and\nsurveillance, where one could both observe and\nbe observed at the same time. The sense of\nalienation she felt within the Tower and within\nthe concrete arena of the College itself inspired\nthe title, 'The Visit of a Stranger', a quote from\nMarcus Aurelius written on one of the Tower's stained glass windows.\nAmidst the discussion, I asked if there had\nbeen any student interest? Well, apparently she\nhad found the Tower plastered with posters\nclaiming that \"Art is dead. Long live The\nBohemians\". So, those fabled revolutionaries\nhad struck again! What had amused her most\nwas the fact that they had used blu-tak, so the\nposters could be removed! So much for radicalism.\nSo, after years of emptiness the Imperial\nPowerPhallus has a new lease of life. It has\nsurvived rebuilding and abandonment to be\nrejuvenated as a new, more cynical symbol of\ndomination. Venture inside the Queen's Tower\nwhile you can while you can (the lower half is\nopen) and experience its unknown past.\nSee page 16 for an interview with Madder Rose\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\nShadowlands\nStarring: Anthony Hopkins, Debra Winger\nDirector: Richard Attenborough\nThe first book I ever bought was 'The Lion, the\nWitch and the Wardrobe'. It cost me 65p, more\nthan a week's pocket money (I was seven at the\ntime) and I read it from cover to cover in two\ndays. 'The Chronicles of Narnia' are loved by\nchildren everywhere for their special magic.\nWriter CS Lewis, known as Jack to his friends,\nwas a deeply re li go us man and led a cloistered,\ncarefully ordered life in the all-male fellowship\nof Magdalene College, Oxford. His mother died\nwhen he was nine and after that Jack lived in a world of his own making, where no one could\nchallenge him emotionally or intellectually.\nShadowlands is the tragic and moving love\nstory of CS Lewis (Hopkins) and Joy Gresham\n(Debra Winger), an American poet inspired by\nLewis' writings to start a correspond ance with\nthe best-selling author. She sails to England and\nbefriends Lewis. The pair fall in love, but it's only when Joy is diagnosed with cancer that\nJack realises how much she means to him.\nAnthony Hopkins excels as Jack, portraying\nhim as everything that is Oxford: the tradition,\nthe stiff upper lip, the smugness. The character\nseems emotionally wooden at first, but Hopkins\nmanages to make his face appear to melt as he\nrealises his love for Joy Gresham. Debra\nWinger's great performance adds a much\nneeded touch of humour in places. As Joy, she\nhelps Lewis to show his true feelings. Joseph\nMazzello is note-worthy as Joy's young son\nDouglas who at first holds Lewis in awe.\nA scene that sticks in my mind is when he is\nexploring the attic of Jack's home and discovers\nan old wardrobe. He opens the door to find it\nfull of coats and pushes through, obviously in\nsearch of the magical world of Lewis' books.\nMazzello clearly shows the disappointment\nDouglas feels when he finds nothing inside. It is\na feeling we all know, like the first time you're\ntold Father Christmas isn't real.\nThe idyllic setting of Oxford is a perfect\nbackground with its towers and oak-panelled\nrooms. Attenborough uses locations to their\nfullest with opening shots panning a choir\nsinging in chapel and further scenes of mist-enshrouded towers and student celebrations.\nShadowlands has a message everyone can\nidentify with: if you love someone, tell them\nbefore it's too late. Call me sentimental if you\nlike, but I was sobbing from the last half hour of\nthe film onwards (as was the rest of the\naudience). The messages are so clear, the\nfeelings so intense. This is a film that everyone\nshould see.\nLynn B! Out in London now. Odeon Kensington,\nKensington High St., cones \u00a33.50 before 6pm. UCI Whiteleys, Queensway, \u00a35.75, cones before\n3pm \u00a33.50\nOn Deadly\nGround\nStarring: Steven Segal, Michael Caine\nDirector: Steven Segal\nAn impressive work. The screen rips open with\na( surround sound) blast of reed pipes to reveal a gigantic empty vista of virgin white snow. The\ncamera dives down, sweeping between mountain\npeaks struggling to be seen beneath their white\nblankets and soars into the heavens again.\nThis is a big film. The first five minutes\nestablish Segal's cavalier/cowboy status as he\nextinguishes an oil well fire as well as his\ncompassionate-but-hard status (beats up guy in\nbar but doesn't enjoy it). At first it seems fairly\nstandard fare, with some unforgivable dialogue.\nBut, as with Under Siege, it grows into an\ninvolving and well-paced drama. Segal is forced\nto take arms against his employer - Michael\nCaine in devilishly good form - who is cutting\ndangerous corners to rush through a refinery\nbefore rights revert to the eskimos. They adopt\nSegal as their champion on a weird vision-thing\nwhich is surprisingly gently handled.\nBy now the hostile press are mute and\nenthralled. Spectacular explosions and scenery,\nwell choreographed fights, a stunningly good\nsoundtrack and a reasonably tight plot all make\nMy Life\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Nicole Kidman\nDirector: Bruce Joel Rubin\nBob and Gail Jones (Keaton and Kidman), a wealthy couple living in California, are\nexpecting their first child. Bob has terminal\ncancer and naturally wishes to live long enough\nto see his child. He decides to make a video of\n'his life' for the child to learn about its father as\nit grows up.\nMeanwhile, as a last resort in tackling the\ncancer, Bob visits a Chinese healer (Haing S. Ngor). Treatment, he is told, is not possible\nwhile his heart harbours this much anguish.\n'What anguish?' he asks. Forced into self-analysis (most American's idea of heaven, I think) Bob Jones realises that he has little\nunderstanding of the methods and maxims ruling\nhis own life and sets out to fathom them with the\nsupport of his wife Gail.\nThe acting in My Life seems stagnant and the\nsense of urgency is not consistently carried\nthrough. I was never convinced that the lead\ncharacters were really married to each other -Eco-friendly? Sure, I recycled the plot.\na highly satisfying package. Under Siege had\nslightly more tension, but this is a commendable\nride, and even Segal's eco-speech at the close is\naccepted by a dazzled audience.\nExpect this one to run and run and for\nheaven's sake see it in a decent cinema for the\nsound.\nThe Pear.\nOpens today across London. MGM Fulham Rd,\ncones \u00a33.50 before 6pm.

    "content": "M4f Feature\nLooking at Europe with 2020 Vision\nHow can Europe live up to its hopes and avoid the pitfalls by the year 2020?\nRegional economic fluctuations within our\ncontinent are one of the major European\nheadaches of today. Economic and financial\nindicators vary from country to country and even\nfrom region to region. Each administration is\nstriving to improve their own region by deciding\non and implementing measures that suit a particular situation and point to a particular aim,\nwhether it be to decrease the rate of inflation, to\nraise industrial production or to make a better\nbalance of payments. A single pan-european\nmacro-economic policy cannot and will not cope\nwith regional problems and affairs simply\nbecause they refer to the economic environment\nof a particular European area.\nAt the moment we can distinguish between\ngroups of countries in Europe that either form a particular organisation and/or share common\nrecent, past and future aims. These are the\nEuropean Union (EU), the European Free Trade\nAssociation (EFTA), the former Eastern bloc\ncountries and other countries which are members\nof the Council of Europe but do not fall into any\nof the categories above like Cyprus, Malta and\nTurkey. There are extensive differences in\ncurrent economic and political situation as well\nas in aims and strategies among these groups of\ncountries; there is also notable fluctuations\nwithin a group, or among regions in a particular\ncountry\nMy vision of Europe in the year 2020\nencompasses the following points that refer to\na Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals:\n1. Homogeneity in living standards, quality of\nsocial network and other related services.\n2. Well-established economic development and\nprogress ensured by optimum macroeconomic\npolicies ardently followed and reasonably\nadapted only when needed.\n3. Reinforcement of efficiency in all fields and\nlevels of production by the application of\nscientific and technological endeavours.\n4. Use of clean, 'green' sources of energy,\nsuch as Wind Energy, for the operation of\nplants, industries and the European Grid.\nFor many Euro-pessimists the above set of points would probably seem to be of the\nnai'vest Utopia ever! Nobody would blame\nthem since Europe seems to have been\nlosing confidence in itself over the past two\nyears. Nevertheless, despite the recent\ncrisis on European optimism, there\nis an established certainty in the\nEuropean political spectrum that\n\"the power lies with the union\".\nToday, the European economy\nis picking up again and there is\nsubstantial hope that the economic\ndivergence, caused by instabilities such as the\nEuropean Monetary System crisis, the Danish\nand French referendums over the Maastricht\nTreaty and the Swiss referendum over the\nEuropean Economic Area, will be reverted.\nFirstly, the GATT accord last December was\na major relief as trade will now be much more of\na fair play than before. Secondly, re negotiations on the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) will\nestablish certainty among investors and currency\nmarkets. Thirdly, the European Economic Unity\nand the faithfulness in its timetable will provide\na reference to all countries aspiring\nto join the EU. Also, progress on the\nEEA will establish further forms of\ncooperation in all fields between\nthe EU and the EFTA countries.\nMoreover, further st a bilis ation of\nthe Central and Eastern European\nstates' economies and politics by\nmeans of interactive exchange\nof opinion and know-how in all\nlevels will bring them closer to\nwestern standards. Finally, a successful integration of\nSweden, Finland, Austria and\n(perhaps) Norway and\nretrospection of the\napplications of EU integration of Cyprus,\nMalta and Turkey will\nredefine the current and\nfuture relations between\nthe EU as it stands and\neach of these countries\nWe also have to\nrealise that this current\nphase of the European\nhistory is critical. At\nthis difficult time\nthere are quite a number of factors\nthat can lead the\n'European\nDream' to failure. First, and within the EU, there\nis the danger of some countries forming an\neconomic union of their own, leaving the other\nnations in ignorance and with a very uncertain\nfuture. Similarly the so-called 'poor' countries\nmay not be able to continue their economic\ndevelopment due to inner deficiencies as well as\nlack of the Union's solidarity. There is also still\nthe possibility (quite remote now, though) of the\nERM collapsing under the pressure of currency\nmarkets. Prospective members of the EU( EFTA\nplus Cyprus, Malta) will have second thoughts\nabout joining the Union once the crisis sharpens\nand will think that they are still better off on\ntheir own. Lastly, if the former Eastern\nbloc countries are not given further\naid in order to continue and finish\noff with reforms they may well\nface a continuous recession along\nwith social and political unrest. All\nof the above will lead to severe\neconomic discontinuities and\nincoherence throughout the continent\nTop priorities are\ntherefore the following:\n1. Enhancement of\ncohesion between the 12\nmember states of the EU by\nmeans of coordination and\nfurther funding of all the\nrelative programs for regional\ndevelopment.\n2. Further cooperation between\nthe EU and EFTA countries as\nwell as structural changes within\nthe EU leading to the successful\nintegration of the four\naforementioned countries.\n3. Increase of opinion exchange and\naid at all levels with the central-eastern European countries.\n4. Mostly important: to present a new\npan-European perspective for the future\nwhich will cater for all countries\naspiring to share interest, opinion and\nbeliefs over the crucial problems of the\ncontinent; i.e.a blueprint for the United\nEurope.\nKyriakos Hatzaras\n(Greek Delegation for the 'Europe 2020'\nConference.)\nPart 7 of Cracking Cryptic Crosswords is on the back page\n\n"

Yes, an absolute must for both\nfeminists and the M(7*'r an r \u2122-touting men in\nanoraks who hang around the Union Building.\nSurprisingly, however, I would actually\nrecommend this production to thinking people of\nall political persuasions.\nA monologue lasting an hour and a half nonstop by the authoress seems pretty heavy and her\nperformance is very powerful, but there is no\nAngels in America\nPart Two: Perestroika\nEavesdropping, I learnt that a fair few of this\nevening's audience had seen Millennium\nApproaches at today's matinee, and were in\ndesperate need of the final fix of Tony\nKushner's Angels in America double-bill. But\nfor those of limited time and finances, a knowledge of Millennium Approaches is by no\nmeans essential, although a quick glance at\nPerestroika's programme might be advisable.\nI'm going to run through the plot so that you\ncan appreciate easily the more important aspects\nof the play. So in a single breath if-you-please:\nformer McCarthy-ite stooge - has relationship\nwith Mormon, married Republican clerk - who\nloves Leftie, reactionary type - who has just\njilted the sensitive yet sardonic Prior Dillane.\nNow if I tell you that all of the above are male\nand that the first and last have AIDS, then you\nmight think you'd died and gone to Soap-Opera\nHell. Forget it because although you're going to\nget a glimpse at Heaven, feet are planted on terra\nfirma, circa 1985-90. A healthy dose of fantasy\nhas allowed Kushner to chronicle our decade\nbetter than fact alone could manage.\nAllegory between the personal nitty-gritti es of life and Universal Truths often seems clever-yet-contrived. Not tonight. The AIDS patient,\ntoo scared to consider a future, and the obstinate\nBolshevik, clinging on to tried-and-failed\nideologies of yesteryear, show movingly that\nchange and progress, although vital, ain't half\nhard for us mere mortals. Divine assistance isn't the solution because Heaven is a place where the\nsole pastime is playing cards. In a stagnant\nafterlife, it provides \"the only pleasure of\nParadise: indeterminacy\".\nWho could disagree? Today we see a rudder less Britain, with Cap'n Major at the helm\ntelling the nation to get back to basics that\nprobably never were.\nFrom slow beginnings where the distinction\nbetween fact and fantasy is sometimes\nconfusing, alliterative ly blessed director Declan\nDonnellan manages to make Kushner's personal\nvision accessible. I don't doubt that there will be\nfuture productions of Perestroika that just don't click.

Lenin\nand others were idealists, genuinely interested in\nbettering the lot of their countrymen. Stalin on\nthe other hand is seen as a villain, executing all\npolitical opponents.\nThere is no moral ising here; none of the\nOrwellian cynicism about pigs becoming men.\nJust a genuine attempt to understand a less\nknown, but still central figure in the happenings\nof October 1917 that changed the world.\nThe body of Karl Marx, who died in 1883,\nwas brought to the New End Mortuary, which is\nnow the New End Theatre, before being interred\nin the Mausoleum that marks the grave of one\nmore equal than others.

    "content": "Reviews 17\nMore cartoon capers from the\nlad with plus fours. Although\nit's a sparse bag this week, here\ngoes. Blur's 'Girls and Boys'\nis a fully rounded record. The\nPear squirts. \"The essence of\nwhat pop music should be; refreshing, light and\nwith the minimum of lyrics...I love it. It's marvellous...Blur for ever.\" Freddy has to grit\nhis ears for Tool and 'Prison Sex'. \"Enormous\npounding bass, limitless energy and Maynard's incomparable vocals. This ought to be a good\ndeal more impressive, but is merely good.\"\nDownstream, Guy has the\nbroken bargain bin to himself,\nMaxine and 'Hovering'. \"If\nonly I could really enjoy\nrecords like this. It sounds\ngorgeous; chiming guitars echo\nout over pulsing, sometimes almost dub rhythms\nand short fragments of vocals are used as an\nextra instrument rather than as a voice.\nEventually it ceases to be music and becomes\njust sound.\" He was also going to review Shed\n7 but his vinyl got warped. \"Best thing for it\", he\nmuttered, disappearing into Rough Trade Records.\nRose Chronicles\nShiver\nThe easy mind sees things clearly, but only\nbecause it can't see shadows. On the subject of\nthe Rose Chronicles some such minds would\ncall out 'Canadian All About Eve' and\nsometimes it's true. 'Glide' does mention the\nword 'harbour', and 'Deirdre' gets close in\ntempo but 'Shiver' is more exciting than Regan.\nThe core for the lyrics is vaguely religious;\nlots of angels, the odd demon, souls galore and a final track called 'Awaiting Eternity', even God\ngets a credit in the liner notes. Yet for all this,\nthe album is ethereal in the sense of being\notherworldly rather than supernatural.\nFinally when the mists have settled, there are\njust four glorious tracks and only one of those is\ntranscendent. 'Nothing's Real' flies high from\nthe stakes of failed love, the vocal inversion\nhinting of the breaking on offer. But how much\nis a single beautiful song worth? (5) Tintin\nBuckpets\nTo The Quick\nThis Dallas four piece have been around since\n1988, recording two albums for Island Records\nbefore this one for the US label Restless. They\nenjoyed credibility boosting support slots with\nNeil Young, and Jane's Addition, who\neventually kicked them off their tour for\n'showing a little attitude'. But despite their\nsuccess on the American circuit, the band are\nstill relatively unknown over here.\nThe music mostly recalls the gentle melody\nof the Smashing Pumpkins with the occasional\nnod towards Sonic Youth, but there's enough\nvariety here to avoid becoming just another\ngrunge wannabe e. Their fondness for writing\neverything joined up makes for interesting, if\nslightly confusing, lyric sheets. Altogether this\nis a well packaged, well recorded album that can\ndo nothing but good for their chances over here.\n(9) Ridley Dash\n1\n1\n1r fl ll111111111111 Soundgarden\nSuperunknown\nOpener 'Let Me Drown' hints at upbeat grunge\nstomp, carelessly shrugging off the miserable\ndirtiness all too often associated with the ' G' word. But then 'My Wave' funks out to prove\nthat no hole's gonna be big enough for this\npigeon. Diversity is the key word here. With 16\nsongs in 73 minutes, I couldn't begin to describe\nthe breadth of this work. Tracks range from the\ndoo my, Sabbathy fuzz-bass of '4th of July' and\nthe glee less 'Mailman', \"I know I'm heading for\nthe bottom but I'm riding you all the way\", to\nthe flip py, Beatle-ish 'Black Hole Sun'; from the\nbizarre Turkish folk-Zeppelin hybrid 'Half to\nthe punk rock 'Kickstand'.\nAt the same time, it's recognisably the same\nband which recorded 'Badmotorfinger' and\nwhilst each song has its own distinct identity,\nthey combine to form a coherent album with that\nirresistible Soundgarden groove running\nthread like throughout.\nAll four 'gardeners' put in sparkling\nperformances but it's Chris Cornell who stands\nout. He is simply the greatest singer in rock\nmusic today, capably switching from bluesy\ncroon to stratospheric howl and encompassing\nthe ranges of Layre Staley and David Coverdale\nwith ease.\nEvery time I play this, I hear something new.\nIt's an outstanding work of breathtaking\nmagnificence and I feel a tad mean knocking a point off it for slightly over polished production.\n(9) Freddy Cheeseworth\nBeing generous we'll allow Glyph to talk long.\n\"I have always regarded Morrissey as\nsomething of a literary acrobat. He appears to be\nout to impress, purely on his verbal somersaults\nand lyrical tumbles rather than by the\ncommunication of anything relevant. His\nprovision of vignettes depicting elements of all\nour little insecurities and worries tend to make\nus sit up and ponder, thankfully, that someone\nelse has those little setbacks in their life as well\nas us and that we have a friend somewhere.\nHowever, it would be far too easy to assume\nthat to be true and it often leaves something of a bad taste in the mouth when it suddenly dawns\non you that he is actually mocking your\nweakness as opposed to em pathi sing with you.\nThis song, 'The More You Ignore, The Closer I Get', being a case in point...Pass me the Daffs\nSteven.\"\nOh Adonis, Adonis. Morrissey a figure of fun\nIIIIII\nCombustible\nEdison\n18 Winger\nDifferent. It's different. In similar vein to Angelo\nBadalamenti's Twin Peaks Theme this is an\nexploration into chime bars and xylophones, an\nalbum of seedy glamour, casinos and low dives.\nIt's cocktail parties in the '50s with white pianos\nand tuxedos; instrumental p links and wails\ngently conveying you from mood to mode and a clean relaxed feel broken only by singing.\nIn what it is, it's good, but far too\ninaccessible. Describing it as quirky would be\nmisleading but maybe it' ll find it's niche\nsomewhere. (4) The Pear\nI might break someone because of you\n\n"

I too like nothing\nmore than to accompany 'Stairway to Heaven'\nwith the sonorous drones of my didgeridoo. But\nmore importantly, I too have been assaulted by\nthe London Church of Christ. It was within two\nweeks of arriving in London, when I could have\nbeen classed as vulnerable cult fodder; \"Excuse\nme. Would you like to come to a meeting\"...\"It's a religious meeting, at King's Cross.\" Oh yes,\nthankyou, goodbye. I am not the only one -virtually everybody I know has been attacked by\none of these evangelists. These people are\ndangerous; they are not out to save your souls,\nbut rape them. They are out to erase your minds.\nThe London Church of Christ must be\nstopped. Sadly I doubt that the Union has\npowers to prevent them infesting our campus, so\nthat leaves the students as the only ones who can\nremove them. If you are approached by one of\ntheir 'friendly' preachers don't walk away, but\nat the very least insult them, abuse them, politely\noffer to remove their testicles if they don't leave\nimmediately. These people prey on the weak and\nturn them into zombies. They are criminal, so\ndeserve nothing more.\nA more effective solution, however, would\nbe to crush the 'Church' at its root. Being in a cult, these people can no longer think for\nthemselves, their minds are worse than\nvegetable - they are positively mineral. It is\nsurprisingly easy to destroy such a cycle of non-thought (I will always remember with glee the\ntime I broke down a Krishna's entire belief\nsystem with just five minutes of post-Crowleyan\nNew Age pseudo-rhetoric. I left him\ngob smacked, and walked away). To destroy this\ncult we need counter activity( the London AntiChurch perhaps?), we need vigilantes willing to\ngo to the meetings and subvert them from\nwithin. So if they approach you take up their\noffer. Go and talk with them, win their\nconfidence, and then strike them down. Break\nthrough their parrot-spoken tales of love and\nmake them see how mistaken they are. By\nturning these people round, by forcing them to\nuse their minds again, maybe the London\nChurch of Christ can be destroyed.\nYours,\nMarcus Alexander\nMech Eng UG2\nBitter Sweet Words\nDear Felix / Jon Jordan\nI was aggrieved to learn of the tenuous hold a certain Mr Jordan appears to have with some of\nthe finer points of English grammar as shown in\nhis letter 'Politics, Engineering & Peace',\nappearing in the last issue of FELiX. Take for\nexample the well-known \"either...or\"\nconstruction, \"Either learning is the best thing to\nemerge from our mind's eye AND it's also a terrible thing...\".\nI was also concerned with the soundness of\nhis logic: \"What's wrong with being career-obsessed? Despite the regular mention of such,\nI 've still yet to meet such\". I am sure that if Mr\nJordan ever were to meet 'such', he would\nrealise exactly what is so wrong about it, but\nsince he claims not to have as yet, then his\nignorance is understandable and forgivable;\nbesides, 'obsessed' is not the same as 'oriented'.\nAside from these minor obstacles to thought,\nhowever, I was actually very concerned about\nthe second half of his onslaught against the\nideologists, in which he makes the alarming\nclaim that nationalism is one of the strongest\nsocial forces available. Perhaps next week we\nshall see Mr Jordan extolling the virtues of\nHitler, Stalin, Karadzic and the like.\nBefore he goes about attaching labels such as\n'naive' to ideologies and people he does not\nknow, I suggest Mr Jordan think about the labels\nhe might possibly be attracting, such as\n'xen oph obe', 'bigot' or (shock, horror!)\n'narrow-minded fascist'.\nInternational Nite last Friday was a prime\nexample of the broader educational experience\nwhich we could hope to acquire by studying in\nsuch a cosmopolitan environment as Imperial.\nThose present witnessed a joyful celebration in\nverse, dance and music, of the cultural splendour\nof each nation's heritage, which unlike political\nnationalism, is a great unifying force. If you\nwere unable to attend, I can heartily recommend\nyou listen to 'Deep Forest' to capture some of\nthe spirit of the evening.\nIdeally I'd like to think of your letter as a cunning ploy inciting me to reply and as such\nyou've succeeded. No doubt you will feel\nabashed by my less than complimentary remarks\nand feel it necessary to retaliate, but don't expect me to be similarly bruised, for, of course,\nI have far more important things to do, such as\nlearning, perhaps picking up some marks on the\nway.\nIn summary, prejudice arises due to a lack of\neducation, which clearly Mr Jordan is suffering\nfrom if he is still in two minds as to which end\none normally begins to read a letter, so to make\nthings simple, Jon, here's a hint: start at the\nother end.\nYours sincerely,\nSagar Das,\nChem Eng 3\nShadowlands is reviewed on page 15\n\n"

Cross campus voting\nwill decide the sabbaticals for next year.\nAndy Wensley now takes you through highs\nand lows of the Single Transferable Vote (STV)\nsystem used by Imperial College Union.\nTo be a 'winner' under STV, you need to get\nmore than 50% of the vote. If no candidate has\nachieved this, the candidate with the least\nnumber of votes is eliminated. Their votes are\nthen distributed amongst the other candidates\naccording to how the voters placed their second\nvotes on the ballot paper.\nYep, you can vote for more than one\ncandidate because you place them in order of\npreference on the ballot paper. So, for the one\nyou want to win, place a'1' beside their name.\nFor your next favourite, place a'2' and so on.\nYou don't have to place a preference against\nall of the candidates. If you want to select only\none, then that's OK. Putting a'2' against your\nnext favourite candidate does not affect the\nchances of your first choice winning. The '2'\nonly comes into play if your first choice is\neliminated as being the candidate with the least\nnumber of votes (as described above).\nHere's An Example:\nYou are given a ballot paper for President. There\nare four candidates: Tom, Dick, Harry and New\nElection. (Remember that if New Election wins\nthen a whole new election is called)\nYou like Tom the best, Dick and Harry seem\nto be pl on kers so you decide to vote like this...\nDick 4\nHarry 3\nNew Election 2\nTom 1\nWhen all the votes are counted, on the first\npreferences, they poll,\nDick 230\nHarry 270\nNew Election 290\nTom 410.\nA total of 1,200 people voted. But the winning\nline is 601 and nobody got that far. Time to go\nto the second preferences, so Dick is eliminated\nas the candidate with the least votes and all his\n'2's are counted. Of those 230 votes, 175 voters\nput Tom as number '2', 25 go to new election,\n15 go to Harry and 15 had no second preference.\nSo now the votes stand at...\nDick 285\nNew Election 315\nTom 585\nNon Transferable 15.\nThis still adds up to 1,200, but now the winning\nline is 593, half of 1,200-15+1.\nStill no-one has a winning quota, so Dick's votes are shared out as before but if any of\nDick's'2' s went to Harry, these are shared out\naccording to the third preferences. Looking at\nDick's votes, 200 go to Tom, 35 go to New\nElection and 50 are non transferable (there were\nno further preferences). A quick totting up gives...\nNew Election 350\nTom 785\nNon Transferable 65.\nWe have a winner!

Although all candidates were\nasked if they had job offers to accept if not\nelected, the audience did not seem to attach\nmuch weight to the answers.\nThe first candidates to be questioned were\nthose for Felix Editor & Print Unit Manager:\nOwain Bennallack and Joe McFadden. They\nwere asked how they intended to get more\npeople involved with Felix (as required by their\nmanifesto promises): Owain promised unceasing\nscouting for new contrib-u tors, while Joe\nconcentrated on the targeting of specialist groups\nfor their expertise in certain areas.\nNext was Deputy President (Finance &\n3. Your swipe card will be\nelectronically checked\nand you'll be given Sour\nvoting forms.\nServices): Tim Brown and Dan Look. Apart\nfrom being asked to restate their names more\nclearly (as the questioner apparently could not\ntell them apart), they did not say much that\ndiffered from interviews and manifestoes.\nThe next candidates were those standing for\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies): Mark\nBaylis, Maria Moratis and Ian Parish. Mark\nfaced extended individual questioning over his\nconcentration on sporting clubs and Ian made\nlabour ed the point of his intention to look for\nexternal sponsorship for societies. Only Maria\nshowed she knew the effect of the Government's student union reforms on societies' funding.\nFinally came the candidates standing for\nPresident: Kamran Bashir, Lucy Chothia and\nPaul Thomas. Bypassing the microphone,\nKamran emphasised his experience of other\nLondon colleges, gained from having lived in an\nintercollegiate hall and organising several club\nnights. He promised to attract first years and\nexternal students by organising more club events,\nleading to the suggestion from a questioner that\n4* Put a J next to your ist\nchoice, 2 next to your\n2nd choice etc.\nhe stand for Ents Chair instead.\nIndividual questions were also directed at\nLucy Chothia, who promised to regularly give\nextra time to talking to students without requiring\nappointments to be made. She rebuffed a suggestion that her manifesto pledge to ease\norganisation of non-Ents events was not\nnecessary, citing her experience with the Third\nWorld First society as evidence.\nPaul Thomas promised in his speech to\nimprove communication between the Union and\nstudents, primarily by resurrecting the 'Reaching\nOut' information stalls employed at the end of\nlast year. He also emphasised his involvement\nwith the Union (as U GM Chairperson) and his\nconsequent experience of its running. All three\ncandidates were asked how many UGMs they\nhad attended: Paul said all of them, Lucy said\nthree and Kamran said none.\nThe only unquestioned candidate was New\nElection, who is standing for all posts.

However, Government restrictions on access to supercomputers will be applied. This\nmeans that researchers from such\ncountries as Communist China may\nbe barred from using the facilities.\nResearch projects planned for\nthe Centre include multi-media and\nvirtual reality applications. Other\ndepartments intend to run complex\nprograms ranging from a new\nmethod of analysing the Earth's core to modelling semiconductor\nmaterials.\nThe new Centre will be headed\nby Professor John Darlington, who\nsaid \"we look forward to a successful partnership [with Fujitsu]\".\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe current state of British science\nwill come under scrutiny at a public\ndebate on Wednesday 23rd March.\nThe meeting is organised by the\nInstitution of Professionals,\nManagers and Specialists as part of\nSET7, the Government's initiative to\nraise awareness of science and technology among the public. The\ndebate aims to question the effectiveness of British science and\nexplore its future. Questions that will\nbe covered include: 'What is science\nfor?'; 'Is science getting its fair\nshare of school leave rs?'; 'Can science create more jobs?' and 'How\ncan science recruit more women?'\nThe debate will be hosted by a panel of science experts, journalists\nand MPs, consisting of David\nBellamy, Professor Jocelyn BellBurnell (Open University),\nProfessor Alec Boksenberg (RGO),\nWill Hutton (science writer for The\nGuardian), Anne Campbell MP, Don Foster MP and Robert Jackson\nMP.\nEntrance to the meeting is free\nand all are welcome to join in the\ndebate.

    "content": "Feature\nPurity, Beauty and Musical Alchemy\nPatrick Wood talks to conductor Andrew Davis and soprano Patricia Wise\nabout Alban Berg's Lulu, one of the greatest operas of the twentieth century.\nAndrew Davis, Chief Conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. (Photo: Alex von Koettlitz)\nThe name of Schoenberg spells commercial\nsuicide for concert promoters. Of those\ncomposers who have adopted the methods of\nserial composition, it is only Schoenberg's pupil\nAlban Berg whose works have gained anything\nlike widespread public acceptance. The\naccessibility of Berg's two most popular\ncompositions has been enhanced by their\nextra-musical associations. In the grim realism\nof the opera Wozzeck, it is not difficult to see a powerful reflection of the misery the composer\nhimself experienced as a soldier in the Austrian\narmy. And the rich and beautiful Violin Concerto is a requiem for the 18 year-old Manon\nGropius, stepdaughter of Alma Mahler, which in\nthe last movement magically merges its\ntwelve-note row into the opening theme of a Bach chorale.\nOnly recently, however, has it been possible\nto understand the personal motivation behind\nBerg's greatest work. Now, with hindsight, it\ndoes seem odd that someone in a lasting and\nblissful marriage, as Berg ostensibly was, should\nbe drawn to Wedekind's two Lulu plays, with\ntheir pessimistic and ultimately tragic\nexploration of sexual attraction. \"Berg was, I believe, rather obsessed by sex,\" says conductor\nAndrew Davis. \"We've discovered more and\nmore in the last few years about his affairs,\nparticularly of course with Hanna\nFuchs-Robettin, who was the inspiration for\nprobably both the Lyric Suite and Lulu. At the\nsame time, I don't think he just stayed in his\nmarriage to Helene because it was convenient. I think there was something about their\nrelationship that he needed.\"\nBut he also needed a different type of\ninvolvement, which he found in his idealistic\nadoration of Hanna Fuchs-Robettin. Berg's wife\nseems to have understood the nature of the\naffair. \"He didn't want too close an association\nwith this woman, as he imagined her in the\nunheard of flores c en ce of his artist's fantasy, for\nfear of disappointment,\" she wrote in a letter to\nAlma Mahler in 1936, a few months after Berg's death. Helene was to survive her husband by\nmore than forty years and throughout this time\nshe forbade the completion of the opera's third\nact, which Berg had left un orchestrated. Lulu\nwas performed only as a two-act torso.\nAndrew Davis recalls meeting Helene Berg\nin the early seventies, on a chance visit to the\nBergs' summer residence in southern Austria.\n\"We had tea and chocolate cake and I asked her\nabout Lulu. She quoted the line that she'd been\ndelivering for years: 'I showed it to Schoenberg,\nWebern and Zemlinsky and none of them\nwanted to finish it and said it should be left and I think it should be left,' and the great mystery is\nwhether she really believed that, or whether, I don't know, was this her way of getting back at\nAlban for all his infidelity? I don't think so, but\nit is very strange because everyone knew and she\nknew, I suppose, that the piece was so almost\ncomplete that it was really untenable to say that\nyou couldn't perform it.\"\nWhatever the reason, it was not until 1979,\nthree years after Helene's death, that the\npremiere of the complete three-act Lulu was\ngiven and the apotheosis of Berg's love for\nanother woman reached the stage. In the final\nscene, Lulu has fallen from the heights of\nfashionable society to the degradation of\nprostitution in late Victorian London. Aiwa, a composer and one of Lulu's past lovers, a character with whom Berg closely identified,\nstands enraptured before a portrait of Lulu in the\nfullness of her beauty, and challenges anyone to\nremain a respectable, conformist member of\nsociety in the face of such allure. It is as if Berg\nwere trying to define the nature of his idealistic\nrelationship with Hanna and at the same time to\njustify it.\nAndrew Davis has been \"completely\ninfatuated\", as he puts it, with the music of Berg\nsince he first heard the Violin Concerto in his\nearly teens.
