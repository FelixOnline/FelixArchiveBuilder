About 60 people turned\nout on a wet Saturday morning to do battle and \u00a375 was\ncollected, which amazed everyone who took part and even\nM....( whose presence was\ndebatable).\nLord Mayor's Show\nSince the beginning of term,\na lot of effort was put into\nthe Guilds float, and its mere\npresence in the show was\nenough to promote a mammoth\n\u00a3150, with an estimated \u00a320\nfrom the Metropolitan police.\nThis was an even more amazing result than the Winks,\nsince street collecting during\nthe show was \"strictly for-bidden\".\nSpurred on by this, Guilds\nturned out in force for the\nnon-event of the year, the 3\nlegged pub crawl with the invisible women from the Royal\nCollege of Music on November 14th. However what could\nhave been a nasty situation\n(judging by the menacing faces\naround the lower lounge that\nnight) was turned into an excellent stag evening by the\nagile brain of Stu Simpson, who\nsuggested going to Hyde Park\nCorner \u2014 so we all went down\nto the West End. The beer\nand money flowed freely, adding a further \u00a3130 to the piggy\nbank.\nBed-ridden\nThe day after brought the\nfamous London - Southampton\nbed race. This was badly\norganised by the College of\nEstate Management, and only 3\nbeds turned up at Marble Arch\nat the appointed hour, including Guilds and Mines/RCS\nentries. The bed was pushed as\nfar as Kingston, when the other\nbed scorched past at about 50\nmph, surrounded by a van.\nThe Guilds hot-bed was then\nduly loaded into a Transit van\nand taken to Guildford, where\nseveral trips were made up and\ndown the main street (the race\nhad now become the Lands End\n\u2014John o 'Groates bed race). \u00a350,\ntwo Southampton University\nsigns, and numerous other odds\nana sous were\nto college.\nduly returned\nMore . . .\nAs if this isn't enough, Elec\nEng 1 went out busking 3\nweeks ago, collecting \u00a330 in a half hour, whilst a week later\nChem Eng made \u00a360 with the\ngorilla (now in Chem Eng 1.)\nA simple addition yields\napproximately \u00a3500, the best\nstart we've made since the\nBoer War; and it doesn't need\na President to work out that\ntwice as many people could\nhave doubled that amount.\nSo come along. Let's have\nmore support \u2014 we need you,\nCarnival needs you. Start with\ncarol singing tonight (7.00 pm\nMech Eng Concourse). You're\nsure to enjoy yourself.

    "content": "i mm\n1 m' The FELIX Late News Supplement\nCORBY N REPLIES WITH';\nTony Kirkhr.ni,\nMiko Y\". tc-s,I en Williams. EDITOR i John Bowman\nDear Editor,\nThank you for giving me the right of reply about my appearance at the ULU\nPresidents Ball of Nov 15th. It is important and useful.for Presidents to attend it, and I would be\nneglecting my duties if I did no\u00a3 go. Many students do not possess DJ\u00bb3 and do not like\nwearing then. It is therefore ridiculous to impose formal dress onto \"open\" student\nfunctions, and wrong that so much money is spent on this, which only interests a minority\nof students.\nAccordingly I went along, expecting to be chucked out. I was held up, but\nallowed to remain, the people in cha.ge feeling that dress wasn't too important.\nDid my indifference to convention affect the uses of the. function? I was .just as\nable, if not more so, to meet other people, including Presidents, and had some useful\ndiscussions.\nI was not seen by the Queen kb the r, who only came for a short time to meet a few\npeople. ,\n, Further, as far as the name of IG Union goes, most other College Presidents don't mind at all I talk to then just the same, if not better! Official bodies are only\nconcerned with what ICU wants, not what I wear! The great mass of students, on whose behalf,\nmoney is spent on this formal function, either don't come or agree with ml\nIt seems the only people who are bothered are those who are bothered about other\npeople being bothered,.,.etc!!\nl ours in Winter-time hope, Piers Corbyn.\nTo check on the reaction of other Presidents to Corbyn's dress, FELICITY rang up Eater\nGeldard (Kings) and the Vice-President of Bedford,\ng The former remembered Corbyn's dress well, but he thought it in character; Corbyn kept\ndisc i$e and caused no embarrassment. However he ag read that an outsider, who didn t know\nPiers as a person, night get a very poor image of ICU, but repeated that most other\nPresidents present knew Piers and were not unduly offended.\nOn the other hand, the V.p, of Bedford, speaking for himself and President 1-^on ty Grigg,\nthought that Corbyn's dress was not at all in place - ho said that ^-'residents who disagreed\nwith the function should not turn up at all rather than turn up looking disrespectful, Ke\npersonally got a very poor imp a bess ion of ICU, as represented by Corbyn,\nFurther, the President of has rung up the Union Office to check up that Corbyn will be properly attired when he attends the Ball at QM D this week,\nAND SO DOES THE QUEEN Piers Corbyn has now received a reply to the letter which was handed to the Queen\nlast Thursday, The reply, written by command of Her majesty, states that after consulting\nwith the Hector the .'iu een has decided to refer the Potter to the secretary of State for\nEducation (Edward Short). Presumably the Union can now await a further reply from him,\nCARNIVAL SUCCESSES last weekend saw a heroic attempt on the world 24hr. Darts Record. A team of six i': CS\nstudents commenced playing at 12 noon Saturday in the Union snack bar. On their most,\noptimistic estimate*they reckoned on scoring a quarter of million points, but by 7 p.m. they\nthey had achieved their goal and set off to break the record. Unfortunately in the early\nhours the scoring rate dropped and the World record was narrowly missed. At sponsorship of\nalmost \u00a33 per 10,000 points this event should rake in \u00a3150 for Carnival,\nStill on the subject of Carnival, over k Q streamer throwing, beer drinking collectors\nthrew a party on the tube on lio ii& QJ night. This event raised a further \"100 for ^ami val. Carnival now stands at over ,'-\"1500 with a target of \u00a35000 by the end of term.\nDON'T FORGET THE CARNIVAL YialiC ON FRIDAY NIGHT, li dJ OX OiTSCR3 STILL\np,r,o. v v. nY\\.rfp nm "

    "content": "Page ti FELIX 4th December, 1969\nJAZZ EXPO '69\nJazz Expo '69 took place\nin the last week of October.\nIt's the third Jazz Expo\nconcert \u2014 the other two\nwere called Jazz Exo '67\nand Jazz Expo '68. They last\na week, and always have at\nleast one concert of 'Jazz\nfrom a Swinging Era' starring the George Wein All Stars among others (they\nhad two of these this year),\na blues package, one avant\ngarde band and other innumerable people \u2014 some\nquite good, some excellent,\nand some bad.\nI only went to two of the\nconcerts \u2014 both small group\ncontemporary jazz. The first,\non the Friday night featured\nAlan Skidmore, Cecil Taylor and Thelonious Monk \u2014\nthe Saturday concert starred\nJon Hendricks, Mary Lou\nWilliams and Miles Davis.\nThe Friday night concert\nstarted with the Alan Skidmore Quintet. They played\ncontinuously. Next on were\nthe Cecil Taylor Quartet. They were excellent.\nAgain 45 minutes continuous\nmusic. This was free from\njazz \u2014 i.e. it was complex\nimprovisation based on an\nordered structure.\nThe top of the bill act\nwere the Thelonious Monk\nQuartet. Monk was one of\nthe people who started bebop (i.e. modern jazz as we\nknow it). He was noted\npartly for the excellent\ntunes he wrote, but above\nall, for his unpredictability.\nThat night the tunes were\nthere in force, not the un-predictability. They came out\nwith some standard theme\nthat the audience applauded.\nThe tenor is t played a couple\nof choruses, then Monk did\nthe same, then the bassist\nplayed a walk, if you were\nlucky you got a short drum\nsolo and they finished off\nwith the theme again. They\ndid this for every number.\nIt was a great let down.\nSaturday's concert started\n45 minutes late because the\nfirst house overran due to\none of the musicians turning\nup late, so there was a big\ncrowd of a thousand people\nin the foyer pushing to gelt\nto their seats.\nThe show started at ten\no 'clock with Jon Hendricks\nand the Reg Powell Quartet.\nHendrix is famed as the\nleader of the now nonexistent vocal ease group,\nLambert, Hendrix and Ross\n(that's Annie Ross) which\nwas very good, but on his\nown he did a poor set.\nAnd then came Miles.\nThis part is terribly difficult\nto review. What can you say\nabout a genius? Miles Davis\nhad a regular quintet for a few years, a really outstanding group. Unfortunately\nthey broke up last year, and\na new group was formed.\nOne could be forgiven for\nthinking that this group,\nhaving played together for\nsuch a short time might be\na trifle disappointing in comparison with the other one.\nI don't think that anyone\nanticipated that they would\nbe better.\nOnce again the performance was continuous. This\nwas very important because\nthe excitement just built and\nbuilt in the 75 minutes that\nthey played. Wayne Shorter\nplayed soprano sax as well\nas tenor. I have no idea how\nlong he has been playing\nsoprano for \u2014 I know of no\nrecording of him playing,\nbut his use of the instrument\nranked him with past masters\nlike Sidney Becket and John\nColtrane. The marvellous\nthing about him is that when\nfollowing a Miles Davies\nsolo he just continues with\nMiles' idea \u2014 there is a sort\nof telepathy between them.\nAnyone else would be shown\nup beside someone of the\nbrilliance of Miles, but\nWayne Shorter fits perfectly.\nTheir partnership could be\ncompared to that of Charlie\nParker and Dizzy Gillespie\nin the early fifties.\nThere's not much left to\nsay about Miles himself. I confess I had never realised\njust how good he really is.\nThe sound of the trumpet\nsoaring above everything\nelse simply tears through\nyou. It is probably true to\nsay that Miles Davis is at\nhis peak now, which is why\nit is very important that\neveryone who likes any form\nof jazz or pop music \u2014 in\nfact anything in rhythm \u2014\ntakes every opportunity to\nsee him now. If he doesn't come over here, then go to\nthe States to see him\u2014it's worth it, so you can tell your\ngrandchildren that you saw\nthe legendary Miles Davies\nperform.\nHarry Marshbaum\nUNDERGROUND WITH XRIS\nBo Widerberg has brought\nus once again a compassionate heart rending\nstory almost too unreal to\nbelieve. He portrays a situation that brought down a government and changed the\nwhole pattern of industrial\nrelations in Sweden. Like\nElvira Madigan, Adalen 31\nis visually beautiful and has\nmany fine touches, like the\nsweet little child blowing\nbubbles and the adolescent\nyouth trying to undress his\ngirl friend under hypnosis.\nAt times the action seems\nindecisive until the climax\nis reached with the final\nmarch to Linden. What lives\nwith one is the horror of the\nslaying of five innocent law\nabiding people, one of whom\nwas a pretty little girl, a passerby caught between a hail of bullets.\nWho would believe that a peaceful demonstration by\nmen, women and children\nwould evoke such area c tion? Who would have expected a squad of soldiers\nto open fire on such a slender pretext \u2014 maybe\nthere's a moral there . . . All\nthrough the film we are\nshown young people growing up oblivious or possibly\nbewildered by all the turmoil\ngoing on around. The\nstruggles of a family striving\njust for survival, the hardships of a mother\u2014poignant\nlittle details, which make one\nfeel deeply for the father\nand sympathetic with his\ncause \u2014 and then he is\ngunned down \u2014 the strike\nforgotten, life goes on except\nfor the martyrs. Does it\nalways need a death to bring\na change and lessen hard-ship?\nTrue Theatre\nPHOENIX magazine out\non January 12th,1970 has\nbeen covering the theme\n\"Underground\" for this\nissue and one of the subjects\nthat inevitably came up was\n\"Underground Cinema\". In\nthe commercial movie houses\nthe product offered for\nviewing has usually been\nedited to perfection and enshrined in shrouds of well-defined mores and taboos.\nTo counter this the in d pendants arrived and gave vent\nto the freedom of the Underground movement and produced material which requires almost infinite\npatience for its enjoyment.\nBoredom is the media\nthrough which they work.\nThe ideal of a set theme\ndisappears completely and\nis replaced to a certain extent by spontaneous actions\n\u2014 sometimes called true\ntheatre. For people who\nwish to be bored or experimented with, the following pla es may prove of in-te rest. London New Arts Lab. 1\nRobert Street, London\nN.W. I. This is now the\nshowcase for the filmmakers Co-op, which distributes most of the underground films in this country.\nIt also screens rushes from\ncurrent productions and the\noccasional home movie!!!\nElectric Cinema Club at\nthe Imperial Cinema Portobello Rd. formerly handled\nCo-op screenings.

Shaws \"Explosions\" lecture,\na procession of flashes,\nbangs and collapsing shields\nwhich he has been performing since time immemorial.\nThe Chemistry main lecture\ntheatre was packed full of\neager students who were not\ndisappointed in waiting.\nHe started with simple\nphysical explosions, at least\nthey seem small in comparison to what was to\nfollow. No atom bombs, but\na little opera singing, a few\nslides, and a funny anecdote\nevery other minute. He\ndemonstrated the fire-power\nof an antique pistol and\nrifle, using the latter to fire\na tallow candle through three\nthicknesses of plywood, and\nfinished the display with a speech from Shakespeare\nand the simultaneous firing\nof two Very pistols.\nThose left alive and in\nfull possession of all their\nnerve and both ears left the\nlecture theatre having seen\none of the most professional\ndisplays of showmanship to\nbe put on by Wellsoc this\nterm.\nINFORMATION\nLiving in London has its own drawbacks, but lack of\nanything to do, or anywhere to go, is not one of them (pro-vi ded you've got some grant left.) The streets are littered\nwith shops selling unusual items; Kensington Market you\nalready know about, but if you cross High Street Ken.\nfrom there and wander westwards to Kensington Church\nStreet, up there you will find The Bodkin.\nThere is a large selection of posters on show, costing the\nusual high prices, but the advantage is that the shop is within\nwalking distance. Anyone who has lived in the usual prison\ncell known as a Hall of Residence room will appreciate the\nneed for decoration, and posters are one way; magazine\nphotographs are another, but you have to get hold of the\nmagazines.\nColoured posters are usually best, although they cost more,\nand these are in plentiful supply at The Bodkin and several\nother shops: Indica, 102 Southampton Row, sells the cheapest\nposters at 5/- and 10/-, and sells the widest stock of underground magazines and Arts mags/newspapers I know of.\nThey don't sell Ambit, but you can buy that at Karnaks,\nGloucester Road. Indica posters are cheap but not a very\nwide range. Athena Reproductions, Oxford Street is for\nthe artistically minded people with well-lined pockets. It's a good shop, east of Oxford Circus, on the southside. To\nreach it you'll pass Harlequin Record Stores, which has a very wide range at puzzling ly varied prices. Some of the\nposters are three times the price they are at Indica, others\nare cheaper than anywhere else.\nFinally, the poster shop in Campden Passage is way out in\nIslington and also has a very wide range, probably the widest\nto be found, but it costs 2/- there and back on the tube. Still\nworth a visit on a wet afternoon.\nBest advice is to look around before spending any money,\nthat way you won't waste too much hard-unearned cash.\nLong-haired lefties please note, IC barber shop is open\nTuesday 9 a.m. \u20145 p.m., it costs 3/-, on the second floor of\nthe Union building. A gentle hint, Piers?\nRECORD\nREVIEWS\nJody Grind\n\"One Step On\"\nTRA 210\nThis three man group is\none prominent in the Transatlantic rock revival. However, \"Rock & Roll Man\",\none of the tracks, seems to\nbe a carbon copy of \"Johnny\nB Goode\" and this tarnishes any originality the\nrecord has. The first side is\ndevoted to a combination of\nfour tracks, including \"Paint\nIt Black\", collectively entitled \"One Step On\". Tim\nHinkley is a good organist,\nbut tends to sink into the\nbackground on the second\nside, containing mostly hard\nrock numbers, to give way\nto Ivan Zagni on guitar. The\ngroup gives a good live performance but the record is\nsomewhat disappointing.\nMott The Hoople\nILPS 9108\nThe first striking point\nabout this record is the\nsimilarity between lead\nvocalist Ian Hunter and Bob\nDylan. This comes out especially on tracks penned by\nHunter, namely \"Backslid-ing Fearlessly\" and \"Half\nMoon Bay\". This similarity\nis no mean feat and is to\nbe complimented as it is just\none facet of the group. The\nwild treatment of \"You\nReally Got Me\" and the rock\ncompositions by Mick\nRalphs, lead guitarist, of\n\"Rock & Roll Queen\" and\n\"Rabbit Foot and Toby\nTime\" are even more creditable and then a really good\nseven minute version of\nSonny Bono's \"Laugh at\nMe\" brings their skill to the\nfore. The track penned by\nproducer Guy Stevens, entitled \"Wrath and Wroll\" is\novershadowed by the rest\nand is not to be taken as\nstandard for the group.\nRoy Harper\n\"Flat Baroque and\nBerserk\" SHVL 766\nPictured on the sleeve as\nbeing at the mercy of a tiger,\nRoy seems to have chosen a good cross section of his\nmusic for this record. I am\nglad that he included \"I Hate\nThe White Man\", as it sums\nup all his feelings about to-day's society. Some of the\nwords run smoothly, particularly \"Another Day\",\n\"Song of the Ages\" and\n\"Goodbye\", which demonstrates what a good poet he\nis. He plays electric guitar\non \"Hells Angels\" and\nproves how well he can\nhandle the instrument, while\na harp on \"Songs of the\nAges\" and recorder on \"Tom\nTiddler's Ground\" provide\nappropriate backing. Part of\nthe record was recorded live\nat Cousins and is his best\nto date.\nPhil Taylor\n\n"

The objects of\nO.S. C. parties, amongst other functions, are to provide\na special opportunity for overseas students to mix and\nsocial is e, particularly with women, with a maximum of\nease and minimum expense (free admission, free food,\ncheap beer). A large number of overseas students who come\nto O.S. C. parties are never to be seen at other parties around\ncollege.\nHas George X imagined the consequences of advertising\nsuch a party around College \u2014 PARTY, FREE\nADMISSION, FREE FOOD, CHEAP BEER \u2014 without\nstipulating overseas students only? Does George X know\nthat O.S. C. makes a loss per head on students coming to\nthese parties? Does he therefore think that O.S. C. can afford\nto have a party swamped by British students after a free\nparty, food and cheap beer? Does he think that O.S. C. can\naccommodate such large numbers? Does he think it fair that\nBritish 'Casanovas' should scoop the women from, perhaps,\nslightly more inhibited overseas students, who are, perhaps,\nconscious of their language difficulties, and their presence\nin a foreign country.\nAnd just to put himself further into disrepute, George\nX has maliciously used this issue as the foundation for a scathing attack on overseas students in general. Does he\nrealise that NOT ONE OVERSEAS STUDENT had a part\nin the decision of the inclusion of the 'overseas students\nonly' insert on the posters?\nNow maybe George X will ask, 'Well, what's the point\nof holding a party to help overseas students social is e, if\nthere aren't any British students there?\" Well, to an overseas student there are other foreigners apart from the\nBritish! In fact, they're meeting British (male) students every\nday. Who they're not meeting are British (female) students,\nwho they will meet at an O.S. C. party. In fact, I would\nalso like to point out that there are British members of\nthe Overseas Students Committee, including myself, AND\nthat all Council members and members of the Welfare\nCommittee \u2014 majority British groups, who would turn out\nto be the most useful acquaintances for overseas students\n\u2014 were invited.\nI must apologise to overseas students in the College if I sound paternal. I do not mean to be.\nYours faithfully, Clive Robinson\nChairman, Union Overseas\nStudents Committee\nGAC Assimakis\nPast Chairman, O.S. C. Overseas Student's Reservations\nDear Sir,\nA close examination of all that has been happening\nin writing and in action in the college campus involving\noverseas students has compelled me as an overseas student\nto make this humble contribution.\nRecently, I have noticed a great deal of affection shown\nby the union towards the overseas students. While I admire\ntheir intention, I do not support their over-enthusiasm on\nthese matters.\nThe directive to the local landladies on matters of\naccommodation was not a wise decision. Many local students\nare as much new to London as many overseas students and\ncan hardly be expected to appreciate this drastic measure\nat the cost of their own difficulties in finding suitable\naccommodation. So, I suggest that accommodation problems\nof all students, irrespective of whether local or overseas\nstudents should be handled by an ' Accommodation Committee whose efforts should be based on persuasion.\nSimilarly, I feel embarrassed by the special party given\nfor the overseas students only (??). I would support any\neffort to encourage the overseas students to take part in\ngeneral union activities, but I would not support the idea\nof giving a special status to overseas students because this\ncauses misunderstanding amongst many local students.\nAt the end, I specially request George X to come and\ndiscuss with me on the topics which have infuriated him\nrecently.\nYours sincerely, Ashok Chakrabarty\nSouth Africa\n1: Opposition\nDear Sir,\nReferring to the Union\nMeeting of 25 November\nwhen Mr. Muller's motion\nconcerning links with South\nAfrica and racialist countries was mutilated and\nslung out.\nI receive a scholarship\nfrom a South African Company and am Anti-Apartheid. Am I hypocritical?\nI would gladly sacrifice\nmy scholarship if I thought\nI would achieve anything\nby doing so.\nOpposition to the South\nAfrican regime must not\nonly be verbal purely to\nease one's own conscience.\nAction must be taken within the country to set up an\nopposition that will OPPOSE\nthe fascist Nationalists.\nBy accepting their money\nI put myself in a position\nto go back to that evil\ncountry to do something\npositive. By refusing their\nmoney, I could ease my\nconscience, achieve nothing,\nand know damn well that\n\u00a3400 was going to some\ncapitalist sucker, prepared\nto vegetate in the sunshine\nand further the ends of\nVorster's Gang.\nBarry N. Black\nMining 1\n2: Ignorance\nDear Sir,\nI have been moved to\nwrite about what I consider\nto be an unwelcome and disturbing development. At the\nlast Union meeting (Tues.\n25th) there was present a group who proceeded to\nobstruct and disrupt, their\npersonal antagonism to the\nchair was apparent and\novershadowed all else.\nWith regard to the motion\non South Africa a case\ncould have been put forward\nagainst this motion, and for\nthose against this was the\nobvious and sensible thing\nto do. But instead, the\nmotion was amended to distort it completely and render\nit almost meaningless.\nThe confusion and ignorance apparent at the meet-ing, regarding links and connections with South Africa\nmakes the desirability of\nclarification and information\nobvious and perfectly\nreasonable.\nI welcome attendance of\nmore and more people at\nUnion meetings, i and also\nrecognise the organisation\nof groups of similar viewpoint as being legitimate\nand not undesirable, but I sincerely plead for a more\nreasonable and constructive\nattitude in future Union\nmeetings.\nYours,\nD. G.l ones Physics 2.\nCommunity Action\nDear Sir,\nImperial College largely stands in the City of Westminster,\na city of contrasts, and one of a tremendous diversity of\nhuman situations and human needs. It is not difficult to\nimagine in what areas the needs are greatest and most\nneglected, but contentment is not necessarily determined\nby affluence.\nWithin college we already have natural groups of people.\nThese are in halls, student houses, departments and societies.\nGroups of people from different staircases, halls or departments have the immediate opportunity to show their concern\nin the local communities. A swimming club for handicapped\nchildren requires people to help dress and undress the\nchildren and in instructing them to swim. After being accepted at the union meeting the Motorway Scheme requires\npeople to determine the needs local to the motorway in\nNorth Paddington and then to bring pressure to bear upon\nthe authorities. Further many clubs and societies in colleges\nare able to share their interests to advantage among youth\nclubs, schools or among old people.\nLast Tuesday 'Community Action' was initiated in the\nformation of a steering group of 6. Their function is four-fold. Firstly to stimulate action within halls and societies,\nsecond to liaise with the relevant social agencies, thirdly\nto liaise with the relevant committees in college and lastly\nto liaise with other local colleges. They have already decided\nto concentrate their interests, but not exclusively, on North\nPaddington, where there is a particular lack of social agen-cie s. Through tackling specific social needs we may become\nas a college aware of much larger but hidden needs and\nproblems in society. It is hoped that before Christmas 2 or\n3 groups will see some action. What can you and your\nfriends, in hall or your society, do, maybe with our help,\nin the new year?\nYours sincerely,\nKeith Lindsey, John Butterworth, Brian Hains,\nDoug Irish, Jonathan Moont, Mike Muller.\nIt has been necessary to cut a number of letters on this\npage because of space reasons. The Editor reserves the right\nto cut any letter sent for publication and is under no obligation to publish all or part of any letters sent for publication\nin Felix.\nCorrespondents are asked to restrict the length of any letter to 300 words if this is at all possible.\nPolicies,\nNot\nPersonalities\nDear Sir,\nThere is a certain negative\nattitude prevailing among\nsome sections of the Union.\nTheir method is to attack\npersonalities rather than pol-ici es. At the last count there\nwere three censure motions\non Mr. Corbyn for the next\nUnion meeting today, Thursday.\nThese motions do not concern themselves with major\npolicies of the Union. Noone is criticising Mr. Corbyn for pursuing the policies of non-technical diversification, representation, or\nsupport for the Architectural\nAssociation. His major critics won't even explain\ncoherently why they have\nbecome so bitter.\nOur President was elected\non a mandate of progressive\nand positive policies. These\ninclude broadening of cour-ses, representation on the\nBoard of Studies, and greater involvement of Union\nmembers. No-one can suggest that he has gone back\non any of these policies. Noone can suggest that he has\nlost Union support on them.\nThose people who support\nthe Union's major policies\nmust support him at the\nUnion meeting today.\nYours faithfully,\nDave Wield.\nhave opportunities in1970 for graduates in\nCHEMISTRY ENGI\nMATHEMATICS \u00b0 1\nINEERINI1 (\nChemical, Electrical, Mechanical) IKY PHYSICS\nfor\nRESEARCH\nDEVELOPMENT\nPRODUCTION\nTECHNICAL MANAGEMENT\nA wide range of careers for men and women\ntaking RESEARCH or HONOURS DEGREES in\n1970 is available in the Establishments of the\nUnited Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.\nThere are also posts for Graduates with\nPASS and ORDINARY DEGREES.\nOur representatives will be visiting the\nUniversity on 14.1.1970, and can\nbe contacted through your\nAppointments Board.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX 4th December, 1969\nScience and Politics I Is War a Biological Necessity\nIn recent years there has been an increasing use (misuse)\nof biological data to support political doctrines. The object\nof this series of articles is to present a scientifically accurate\naccount of some of these arguments. Of necessity they will\nbe highly condensed and many of the pieces of evidence\nmay at first sight seem doubtful. They can only be supported\nby reference to original papers, which will be cited at the\nend of each article.\nThe first topic is 'Is war a biological necessity?' Politicians have\nused two sets of arguments here, both of which have some\nbiological foundation. The first is a corruption of Darwin's 'Survival\nof the Fittest' and led people (eg Germany prior to the 1914 war)\nto believe that competition between animals for food, shelter, space\netc. naturally led to aggression. Thus war is inevitable in man,\nwhere 'population levels are so high and food resources so low.\nThe second argument is based on the observation that most animals\nnever kill their own kind (eg lions rarely attack other lions). Thus\nthere is no fundamental biological reason why man should kill\nfellow mien. Both are incorrect.\n. Biologically, there are two types of aggression (a) inter specific aggression (ie: fighting between different species) (b) intraspecific\naggression (fighting between members of the same species).\nThe first argument is thus based on inter specific aggression.\nIn these days of escalation, man has intensified his war against his\ncompetitors (eg crop pests) in order to secure a larger proportion\nof world resources for himself. When Darwin talked about 'Survival\nof the Fittest' he was trying to show the struggle between the\nenvironment and a species, not the competition within a species\n(though some biologists disagree!). Thus only those best suited to\nwithstand the rig ours of the en vr on ment will survive. Although the\nfirst arg ume 'nt is basically correct, it does not explain aggression\nwithin homo sapiens, only between man and other animals.\nThe second argument is an over simplification of the facts. There\nis intense competition within a species for food, mates, shelter, etc.\nbecause members of the same species are all competing for the\nsame commodities. Only rarely do two different species compete\nfor the same essentials of life (eg out of one million species of\ninsects, less than 0.1% are considered 'pests' ie compete with man\nfor food). However, in most cases, nature has chanelle d aggression\nwithin a species along certain lines so that it rarely leads to\ndeath. For example, in the competition for mates, combat has\nbecome 'ritual is ed' in the courtship ceremonies (eg peacocks tail\ndisplay and the ritual combats \u2014 which rarely result even in\ninjury\u2014of deer). In the intraspecific competition for space, many\nbirds evolved \"song\" to act as territory markers, warning other\nmembers of the species that this area has already been claimed.\nIn carnivorous animals, where the weapons they possess are quite\ncapable of killing other members of the species, special inhibitions\nagainst killing have been evolved, often by the loser of a contest\nadopting a 'submissive' posture which elicits the 'compassion' of\nthe victor (this is well documented in Lorenz). However, Man\nis a special case. Originally he was a puny animal almost incapable\nof killing his own kind, and thus few killing inhibitions were\ndeveloped. Those that were developed depend on close physical\ncontact (eg bowing the head and presenting the neck to an\naggressor elicits an inhibitory response in Man). Today, long\ndistance warfare means that there is no biological inhibition\nagainst killing.\nThus we can conclude that with a rapidly increasing world\npopulation and the loss of killing inhibitions in modern warfare,\nthat war is inevitable. I hope not.\nDerek Waghorne\nReferences:\nK.Z. Lorenz 'On Aggression'\nD. Morris 'The Naked Ape'\nD. Morris 'The Human Zoo'\nEng Soc Goes to Coventry\nAt 5.30 a.m. on Wednesday 12th November 12 members of the Engineering\nSociety set off towards\nCoventry in heavy rain. We\nwere going to visit Coventry\nColliery, a highly me chan is ed mine and one of the nearest\nto London.\nDespite the Chairman's attempts at map-reading we\narrived at the Colliery without\ngetting lost too many times.\nWe had been warned to take\nold clothes with us, and after\nwe had changed into these we\nwere issued with protective\nhelmets, lamps and emergency\nrespirators (which we did not\nhave occasion to use).\nWhile we were waiting to\ngo to the shaft, we saw cages\ntaking empty skips down descending with an initial acceleration almost equal to that of\nfree fall! Fortunately when our\nturn came we were treated a little more gently!\nWe were given a guided tour\nof the workings leading up to\none of the faces currently being\nworked. Because of the long\ndistances involved, part of the\njourney was made by \"man-rider\" (a truly underground\ntrain: 725 yards below the sur-face). When we finally reached\nthe coal-face we saw the\ncutting machines that have so\ngreatly reduced the labour involved in mining.\nOur return journey included\nyet another form of underground transport: a conveyor\nbelt. When the time came for\nus to go up in the cage, and\nafter two and a half hours\nunderground, we were again\nrelieved not to be treated\nas violently as the coal! When\nwe reached the surface we\nwere shown the winding equip-ment. It uses two of the most\nenormous steam engines I have\never seen. The equipment has\nto be very accurate; the controller must position the cage\nto within an inch in half a mile.\nAfter we had taken a shower\nand changed, the visit finished\nwith an excellent lunch laid\non by the NCB.\nAs we had a few hours to\nspare before coming back to\nLondon we went into the City\nof Coventry itself. A tour of\nthe Cathedral concluded what\nhad been a most instructive\nand enjoyable Engineering\nSociety visit.\nRichard Cole\nStand Up\nand be ordered\nAs the standing orders for Union General Meetings seem\nto be permanently unavailable, Union members must deduce\nthem as best they can, on the basis of observed conduct at\nmeetings. One such empirical set, derived after the continued\nUGM of 25th November, is as follows.\n1. Motions for debate must\ninvariably be read by the Secretary, unless the proposer of\nthe motion can read.\n2. The proposer then makes\na speech of sorts, which is\nfollowed by the speech of the\noppose r, if any. If no oppose r appears within 3 seconds of\nthe Chairman asking for one,\nthe motion is declared passed.\n3. Thereafter speeches for\nand against the motion alter-nate, though not alternately.\n4. Points of Order: These are\nused for disrupting the order\nof the meeting, and take\nprecedence over other business\nif the Chairman can find no\nreason to ignore them. They\nrelate specifically to the conduct of the meeting, or to anything else. The. decision of the\nChairman on these is final unless overruled by the Will of\nthe Meeting, measured in\ndecibels.\n5. Points of Information are\nfor the purpose of insulting\nthe speaker. As he may wish\nnot to be insulted, he may\nignore them.\n6. Procedural motions are\nfor lengthening the proceed-in gs, and are a more formal\nway of expressing the Will of\nthe Meeting. The most accepted\nis the move to a vote, used\nby opponents of the motion\nwhen amendments make it\nridiculous; this immediately ensures defeat for the motion, as\na move to a vote automatically\ncarried.\n7. Amendments are am alternative way of opposing a motion.\n8. Voting is by a show of\nhands, uncounted, followed by\na show of hands, counted, if\nthe losing side has more than\n10 votes. A recount is optional\nif the majority is less than 30,\nbut the Will of the Meeting is\nusually against this.\n9. Challenges to the Chair\nwill be assumed carried if the\nChairman shows any signs of\nknowledge of Standing Orders.\nIt is very rarely made.\n10. No-one shall in any circumstances show any sign of\nmaturity and/or intelligence.\nDisorder shall be maximise d, if\nnecessary by the intervention\nof the Chairman. The outcome\nof any debate shall be extreme\nleft or extreme right, depending on whether the Mines'\nPresident is conducting his\norchestra of trained 'vigilantes'.\n11. Any person or persons\nunwilling to come to UGM's to\nplay his part according to the\nabove rules shall be deemed\n\"apathetic\" and despised by the\nUnion.\n12.

The recent elections in Portugal under the surveillance of an international commission only served to highlight the fac is t nature of the new, supposedly liberal, government of Caetano, a disciple of Salazar.\nThe opposition was subject to continued harassment and threats\nuntil finally the commission was thrown out after presenting a critical report and fascism remained in control.\nSuppression at home, exploitation abroad, for Portugal still\nrules an Empire. Since 1961 the country has been fighting on three\nfronts the last colonial wars in Africa, despite the condemnation\nof these actions by the UN Security Council and General Assembly.\nIn order to support these wars, 40% of the budget is spent on the\nmilitary and all youths are subject to 2-4 years military service.\nYet the people do not want to fight, and in 1967 over 14,000 young\nPortuguese did not present themselves to 'the draft board.\nA campaign is being waged in London at the moment, centred\non the fate of two Portuguese; one, Eduardoi Cruzeiro, is a soldier\nwho deserted for political reasons while serving in Guinea-Bissau.\nAfter further militant action while in Spain toe was arrested\nby the Spanish authorities. A request from Portugal for his\ndeportation, on the grounds that he was a military deserter, was\ngranted. This decision of the Madrid High Court sets a dangerous\nprecedent, for many young Portuguese, in exile would toe in danger\nif other governments took similar decisions. The maximum sentence\nfaced by Cruzeiro is death or life imprisonment.\nThe second case to be highlighted is that of Inacio Palma, a leader of the LUAR (League for Unity of Revolutionary Action)\ndedicated to the overthrow of the present regime, who is at\npresent in Spanish custody awaiting the decision of the Madrid\nGovernment on an extradition request from Portugal. Palma in\n1967 led a daring raid on the state bank, escaping with \u00a3415,000\nto finance the armed struggle. He was shortly afterwards arrested\nin Paris by Interpol, but the French Government recognised the\npolitical nature of his crime and refused a Portuguese extradition\nrequest.\nLater, Palma was captured in his home country and sentenced\nby a political court to (in effect) 15 years in jail plus denial of\nliberty for life. He escaped to Spain, but, as mentioned above,\nwas captured. Collaboration between the Spanish and Portuguese\nregimes has always been close, and the sympathetic Spaniards\nmay well accept the claim that Palma's bank robbery is purely a criminal matter.\nThe Portuguese students committee in Great Britain feels that\nonly an energetic international campaign can save these two men.\nThey ask for letters of protest to be sent to the Spanish author i ties, and a demons;ration was arranged outside the Portuguese\nand Spanish embassies on November 30th, last Sunday.

Philip, when he dined with\nsome of your number last year\nreceived some amusing notes\nfrom this same fellow; he felt\nthe taste of the notes was on\npar with the taste of the meal.\nFollowing the event, we were\nnot amused when Philip arrived\nhome chanting a Kangela.\nWe were pleased at being\ninvited to open your new build-ing, and we hope you did not\nobject to our bringing along\nour husband, but we felt that\nthe tea provided might give a respite from the economy\ndiet of Polo pony steaks au\ngratin with Corgi livers.

    "content": "20th BIRTHDAY EDITION\nSpecial Christmas Gift Inside\n6D IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION NO. 285 4th DECEMBER, 1969\nQueen agrees to reply to Union's letter After two months of full\nuse, the college block was\nfinally and officially opened\nlast Thursday by Her Majesty the Queen, accompanied\nby Prince Philip.\nThe opening ceremony together with the unveiling of\nthe plaque, took place in\nthe Great Hall which was\ncrowded out for the occ a sion.\nThe Queen was due to\narrive at 3.30, and whilst\nthe platform party was being\npresented outside, those inside the hall were being\ntreated to some fine organ\nplaying from the organist\nfrom Salisbury Cathedral.\nThis gave an ideal chance\nto judge the quality of acoustics in the Hall; and according to reports from various\nposition in the hall it is indeed very high.\nThe Student Bedell (Keith\nGuy), complete with mortar\nboard and staff, then heralded the approaching platform party, numbered amongst whom were Her\nMajesty, Prince Philip, Lords\nSherfield and Penney, Edward Short, Sir Dennis\nLogan (Principal of U.L.) and Piers Corbyn. The party\nhaving reached the platform,\nthe National Anthem was\nsung (at least by some of the\naudience), and Lord Sherfield proceeded to welcome\nthe Queen to the college.\nIn his speech, which was\nincredibly badly delivered,\nLord Sherfield brought attention to the relations between\nthe Queen's ancestors and\nImperial College. He went\non to give details of the development of I.C. and mentioned the growth in the last\n17 years from 1650 full-time\nstudents and an annual\nbudget of \u00a3834,000 to 4000\nstudents and a budget of\n\u00a37,500,000. He stressed that\ndespite the magnitude of the\nexpansion, the college had\nnot only maintained but had\nimproved its academic per-form ance. After a short mention of\nthe people who made this\npossible, Lord Sherfield\nasked the Queen to unveil\nthe plaque. In her speech\nbefore the unveiling, the\nQueen made references to\nher trips to the Science\nMuseum as a child. She then\nproceeded to unveil the\nplaque by remote control, at\nwhich point there were murmurs of laughter throughout\nthe audience, followed by a silence in anticipation of it\nfailing to work.\nIn his speech of thanks to\nthe Queen, Lord Penney\ntraced the earlier history of\nthe college. He mentioned\nthat the foundation stone of\nthe Royal College of Chemistry (the oldest constituency\npart) was laid in 1845 by the\nPrince Consort. The College,\nLord Penney said, was\nfounded to train students\nand to undertake research in\nscience and technology. This\npurpose was still the same,\nbut he felt that the students\n\"mainly by their own efforts\nbut with assistance from us\"\nhave managed to extend\ntheir horizons beyond their\ndisciplines.\nThe Queen's procession\nthen left the hall, and Her\nMajesty was shown around\nthe libraries contained in the\ncollege block. On returning\nto the Students' Common\nRoom to join the assembled\nthrong in tea, the Queen was\nhanded a letter (the copy of\nwhich appears on this page)\nand a pamphlet comprising\nthe Union's feelings on Representation and Diversification. This was immediately\nhanded to her private secretary but in Her conversation\nover tea she promised to reply to the President after\ncogitation and consultation.\nThe Queen stayed for an\nextra 20 minutes engaged in\nconversation on Union poli-cie s,3 rd world and the U.S. moon project.\n^\nv v.:y.v. v: \u2122\n:\n-:\n-:\n-\u2122\n^\n^\n^ I III IIII III Mli IHM l Mill l|l||||| l||||||M H||||||||||| ll l||l) l||)l)[|| ll ll ll| Piers Corbyn handing over the Union's letter on Diversification and Representation at Imperial College to\nthe Queen during her visit. A full text of the letter appears below.\nThe Letter\nMay it please Your Majesty,\nOn behalf of the Students'\nUnion of Imperial College I write to outline the students'\naspirations and situation in\nImperial College and humbly request that you use your\ninfluence to promote the expressed wishes of that student body.\nThe Student Union has a number of policies consistent with the idea of creating a socially relevant co-adult academic community.\nThe creation of such a community necessitates student\nparticipation and representation at all levels in the College, and the changing of the\nspecialised courses in the\nCollege.\nThe main fields which the\npolicies of the Student Union\ncover are: Diversification of\nthe narrow and highly specialised education of Imperial College; Representation on academic policy\nmaking bodies and on the\nGoverning Body; and the\nimpending visit of the Architectural Association.\nIt is explained in the Students' Union document recently published \"Diversifi-cation and Representation in\nImperial College\" \u2014 a copy\nof which accompanies this\nletter \u2014 that very slow progress has been made in fulfilling these policies.\nOn Diversification some\nsmall success is coupled with\na backward looking attitude\nby many professors.\nOn Representation on the\nBoard of Studies \u2014 which is\nthe academic policy making\nbody\u2014Students' Union policies have been largely ig-no red. On Representation on the\nGoverning Body and its Finance and Executive Committee, we have been offered\nsome observer status but\nonly in a restricted field of\ndiscussion.\nAs far as the Architectural Association is con-cern ed, we know that the\nnegotiations have reached a crucial stage but are not represented on them. Further we\nfear that many of the good\nprocesses in the Architectural Association Community may be lost when they\njoin Imperial College.\nThe Students' Union hopes\nvery much that you will consider its proposals and do\nwhat you can to help promote its aspirations.\nOn the question of Diversification some professors\nignore the overwhelming\nfeelings of the students and\n(Turn to Back Page, col <\n5\n)\nN.U.S. Conference\nBy our Education Martin For the first time in many\nyears I.C. was able to send\na delegation to an NUS con-ference. At very short notice\nthe External Affairs Committee decided to send atrium v rate of Piers Corbyn,\nDave Wield and Alan Lafferty to observe two days of\nthe four day conference. Predictably these three worthies\narrived half a day before a party at which careful negotiations achieved voting\nrights for I.C., despite our\nnon-payment of fees.\nThe delegation attended\na number of debates on the\ntwo days for which they\nwere at the conference. One\nof the most important and\ninformative of these concerned student grants. It was\npointed out that over the\npast seven years the value\nof an undergraduate grant\nhad decreased in real terms\nby 16 per cent. The Government had repeatedly said\nthat the economic situation\nmade this necessary and that\nthe grant would be reviewed.\nConference felt that now\nthe economic situation was\nimproving, it was time for\nthe Government to think our\nstandard of living back to\nits previous level. The feelings of delegates were\nsummed up by the new NUS\nCorrespondent, Bland President, Jack Straw, who\nsaid, \"Now I am simple man.\nI have always believed\nMr. Wilson as an honest\nman. (Laughter). I believed\nhim when he told us \u2014 in\n1965 and 1968 \u2014 that the\neconomic situation was so\nbad as to restrict our in-crease. I believe him now,\nand Mr. Jenkins, when they\ntell us that the economic\nsituation is improving.\" It\nwas decided that the executive should draw up fresh\nevidence to submit to the\nminister concerning the financial straits of students.\nThis motion was supported\nby the I.C. delegation, in\naccordance with Union\npolicy.\nAnother subject of concern to conference was tea-cher s' pay. It was decided\nthat the whole structure of\nteachers' pay should be investigated by the exec, and\nas much information as possible be brought to a future\nconference. This was also\nsupported by I.C., since the\nUnion had passed a motion\non this subject a week\nearlier. This is, of course, a matter of importance to I.C. in view of the number of I.C. students who go on to teach.\nIt was also decided that\n(Turn to Back Page, col. 4)\n\n"

Since the report in question\nalso quoted from Felix, it is perhaps as well that the facts of\nthe matter be ascertained.\nThe Evening Standard article appeared two weeks ago,\nand mentioned that the Union was having difficulty in obtaining enough students to fill the places reserved for the\nUnion at the Queen's visit because people were turning down\ninvitations. The report originated from Colcutt's column in\nthe last issue but one, and a representative of the newspaper\nthen contacted Piers Corbyn to obtain more information.\nAccording to Mr. Corbyn the report misquoted him, but this\nis irrelevant since the facts contained in the article are\ncorrect.\nWhen the question of selecting students to attend the\nQueen's tea came up at the beginning of term, it was decided\n(at a Union meeting) that the allocation should be split into\ntwo; half to go to year reps and In ion officials, and the rest\nto be distributed to randomly selected students. To deal with\nthe random selection, a female market researcher was called\nin to draw up a list of 75 students. In her exploits around\nthe Union to obtain this list, 50% of the male students declined the offer, many because they felt they would rather\ntake the afternoon off.\nIn the light of these facts, the report is completely true\nas far as the facts presented in the article. There is therefore\nno question whatsoever of the President misrepresenting the\nUnion, and the only case that can be made against him is\nthat he was naive in expecting a representative from the\nPress to agree not to publish opinions which he expressed on\na controversial issue. There is certainly no case for demanding his resignation if he does not write to the Evening\nStandard explaining the facts of the issue for these are readily\nobserved in the paper itself.\nThe visit of the Queen last Thursday cost the College\n\u00a31,500. The equivalent sum would provide many thousands\nof meals for those living on the verge of starvation, would\nbe welcomed by Carnival as a donation to help the mentally\nhandicapped, would provide valuable agricultural machinery\nfor those in the under-developed Third World.\nIt did provide sustenance for us, the fortunate few who\ncan afford to live in comfort.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nEDITOR: MALCOLM WILLIAMSON\nAsst Ed (Production):\nTony Kirkham\nNews Editor: David Chant\nNews and production\nassistants: Ian Williams,\nJohn Bowman, Tony Sims,\nMike Yates, Malcolm\nBailey, John Ackers\nTyping: Susan Parry\nBusiness Manager:\nIan Quarrinton\nCirculation \u2014 Sennet and\nFelix: Roger Lindsay\nAsst Ed (Features):\nIan Carr\nWith Steve Giles\nPhotographic Editor:\nSimon Hoyle\nWith: Andy Thomas,\nArthur Stoller.\nSports Editor: John Darley\nThanks also to: EIIX, Paul\nMellor, Xris, Piers Corbyn, Dave Victor Wield,\nMartin Bland, old Uncle\nTom Cobley and all.\nNational Advertising: J.

Publications Board,\nImperial College Union, London, S.W.7. As agreed by the Union the letter and pamphlet 'Diversifica-tion and Representation in I.C.' were produced and given to\nthe Queen and other special guests, including Edward Short\n(Minister of Education) and Douglas Logan (Principal of\nU.L.). The Queen was interested in what we had to say and\nstayed talking for 20 minutes longer than expected. She\npromised to reply to the letter after due consultation. The\nDuke said that he was all for diversification.\nPress response was: \u2014 a photo and long caption in The\nTimes, and good reports in the Guardian and The Morning\nStar. The pamphlet and letter has now directed public attention onto our policies and has caused a great deal of discussion within the departments.\nPresumably because of expected publicity, the Rector,\non 26th November, kindly offered the Union one place on\nthe AA/ICST negotiations. As was agreed by the ICU\nAcademic Affairs committee on 27th November we must\nmake sure that this place includes participation in the\nnegotiation working parties' discussions and that the Academic Affairs Officer and others are involved where appropriate. The pamphlet and letter are undoubtedly a success. The\nopportunity created is now being grasped, department reps\nare taking copies of them to all professors and initiating\ndiscussion. The 'quiet middle staff' are waking up at last\nand beginning to say some quite strong things. It is important at this point that interested staff and students get\nhold of, or see, copies. All year reps have copies. If you\nknow any member of staff who wants a copy, fetch him one\nfrom the I.C. Union Office.\nHow Fast ?\nSome people feet the Union is doing things too fast and\nthat our speed is annoying certain members of staff and admin.\nSome of these people are opposed to our ideas anyhow, but apart\nfrom that we must realise that some professors will never agree\nhowever fast or slow we go. On Representation there is not much\nexcuse for slowness. Diversification is a more complicated issue\nand so concrete results wiM not be immediate, but nevertheless we\ncan reasonably ask for an urgent plan and make u lse of the\nDiversification co-ordination organisation.\nI.C.R.C. The exploratory meeting concerning the Imperial College\nRepresentative Council which I was instructed by the Union to\narrange was held on Monday, 17th Nov. Following its success we\nmust elect not moire than fifteen students for it at the Union\nmeeting today.\nFollowing discussion on the Student Residence committee and\nhall committees we must make a decision about Freshers in HaU\nat today'sU.

I did not\nmisrepresent anything to the Evening Standard (or any newspaper for that matter), neither did I, on Nov. 25th( or any other\ntime) continuously use the word \"demand\" als opposed to the word\n\"request\".\nYear reps are now being sent things by I.C.U more often than\nIthey used to be; if you have any ideas on finding out things please\ntell your year reps and/or take them to the I.C.

The rugby 1st XV had a convincing win over UC in the Gutteridge Cup 1st round,\nand Mike Adams is to be congratulated on producing a consistent team this season. The football club 1st XI are\njoint leaders of the Premier Division of the UL League,\nand should beat QEC in the UL Cup 1st round proper (see\nFelicity for result).\nSo far this season the badminton club have won all four\nleague games under the guidance of Phil Poyser, but some\nof its members have had even greater success individually.\nAt the British Universities Badminton Championship the\nmens doubles title was won by G. Georgian and S. Donald\nboth from the Maths Dept. at IC. Lynne Beynon of Chemistry II took the women's singles title, was runner-up in the\nmixed doubles and won a bronze medal as semi-finalist in\nthe Women's doubles. Many congratulations are conveyed\nby Felix to all three.\nJ. C.D.

KEN STATION\nThe last 3 matches played\nby the 1st XI have resulted\nin good victories for IC, and\nthe team is now beginning\nto realise its potential. From\nthe start of the season the\ndefence has been sound and\nhas not conceded more than\na single goal in most of the\nmatches. However, until recently the forwards have not\nbeen able to score goals, although they have made\nnumerous chances. Now,\nhowever, that the whole\nteam is working well there\nseems to be no reason why\nthe results for the rest of the\nseason should not be extremely satisfactory.\nIC 1 Kemble College,\nOxford 0\nIC were on top for the\nwhole of this match and the\nscore line does not do justice\nto the margin of superiority\nwe were able to establish.\nThe only goal was scored by\nBates late in the second half\nafter a melee in the goal-mouth.\nSkating\nI.C. Skating Club meets\nevery Thursday evening at\nQueen's Ice Rink along with\nthe girls of the French Institute. At the moment they\noutnumber us heavily so\ncome along and help us out.\nIf you haven't skated before,\ndon't worry, as our club\nmembers range from the expert to the absolute begin-ner, with a high percentage\nof women.\nWe also skate on Wednesday afternoons with UL U Ice Skating Club. Membership cards and cheap tickets\nmay be obtained from Pete\nGoddard, EE PG (Room\n1107, Irit 3154) or by the\nUnion Cloakroom on Wednesday between 1.15 and\n1.40.\nWe do have a very real\nproblem created by the large\nnumber of F.I. girls on\nThursday evenings, as a high\nproportion of them only\ncome along to meet men,\nanyway! You were asking\nfor suggestions on how IC\nmen could meet F.I. women\nin the last Felix, and here is\na good way !\nChris Pickford, Chem PG.\nIC 4 Ashford 1\nThis was an extremely\ngood victory since the team\nincluded 3 members of the\n2nd XI due to injuries of\nnormal 1st team players, and\nalso since Ashford are one\nof our stronger opponents.\nAfter about ten minutes\nPratt scored a very good\ngoal, and the score remained\n1-0 to IC until half-time. In\nthe first 5 minutes of the\nsecond half IC scored twice,\none by Pratt and one by\nBates. Pratt completed his\nhat-trick midway through\nthe second half when the\nAshford goalkeeper allowed\na rather weak shot to trickle\nbetween his legs. The Ashford goal was scored in the\nlast 10 minutes of the match\nwhen the marking in the IC\ndefence had become rather\nslack.\nIC 1 Bart's Hospital a This match was marred by\nthe fact that the opposition\nfailed to bring an umpire\nwith them and it is not practicable for one man to see all\nthe fouls which occur. In\nthe first half, IC pressed hard\nand we were very unlucky\nnot to score on several oc-cas ions. Early in the second\nhalf IC were awarded a short\ncorner and the shot resulting from this was kicked off\nthe line by one of the Bart's fullbacks. The only goal of\nthe match came from the\npenalty stroke awarded for\nthis offence. This goal\nseemed to bring the Bait's team to life and they stretched the IC team to its\nlimits, in fact almost beyond\nits limits on two or three\noccasions. However, IC managed to hold out till the end\nto gain a very good win.\nBoth the 2nd and 3rd XFs\nhad matches with their\ncounterparts from Ashford;\nThe 2nd XI were beaten 1-0\nand the 3rd XI achieved a creditable 1-1 draw. Both\nthese teams have now become much more regular\nand this can only result in\nan upward trend in their\nresults.\nMike Burtt.\nOn Saturday, I.C. entertained Woolwich, who seemed\nto have strengthened their team since the first match of\nthe season when I.C. beat them 4-2. In the first quarter\nof an hour Woolwich put the pressure on I.C. but the\ndefence played well and survived this attack. During a breakaway, Wilcock tried a long shot which went over\nthe goalie for a good goal. This was just reward for Wilcock\nwho seemed to be the only I.C. player willing to have a shot\nin this and in previous games. I.C. were still, however,\nplaying badly. They are unfortunate in that several key\nplayers seem to have lost their recent form at the same time.\nWoolwich equalise d in the first half with a penalty for\nhandball. I.C., starving for the lead, continued to play the\ncompletely wrong game. They persisted in playing a long\nball down the middle, which Woolwich's6 ft6 in centre half\ncounteracted with no difficulty.\nThe game continued in mediocrity, Woolwich collecting\na goal in the second half to clinch the result.\nI.C. made changes for Wednesday's game against West\nHam. These were made to try and find a goal scoring blend.\nThe goals came, although it may be said West Ham were\nnot really spirited opponents. I.C. played a wide game with\nplayers taking the ball to the line and pulling the ball back.\nWilcock once again opened the scoring after some intelligent\nrunning on to a Dixon pass. Wiley scored soon after from a pass from T.M. who beat two men in taking the ball to the\nline and pulling the ball back. McArdle, struggling to find\nform, followed a lone attack by Dixon to slot the ball home,\nto finish a good move started by a long pass out of defence\nby Widelski. In the second half, I.C. cooled down con-sidera bly, playing a less effective game, but still managed\nto score again through Widelski, Dixon and McArdle\n(penalty). We hope this game sees the come-back of I.C. although West Ham may not be a true test.\nThe 5th s, at home to West Ham's seconds, also gained a convincing 13-0 win, with captain Andy Jackson scoring\nsix goals. He was ably supported by M. Hameson who\nnetted four times. Other scorers were D. Coulson, 2, C. Potter, 1. On the defensive side, the two full backs played\nably when pressure was applied. This was 5th s second\ngood game having drawn with league leaders Woolwich\n2nds who had previously not had a goal against them in\nthree games.\nAfter hearing of Mines' recent good form, the 2nd XI expected a good game. The 2nds, however, brushed aside\nMines to pulver is e them 7-0. But it must be said that I.C.2 nd fielded a very strong side, five of whom have had 1st team experience.\nRoger Dixon (Vice Captain).\nChrtsstmajf i mr pris ie THE FELIXPILL\nThe new concept in controlled con cup is c en ce.
