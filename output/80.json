    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE: THE1, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF GUILDS'.\nRecently married Keith Miller is perhaps the most\nenergetic and earnest of this years Union Officers.\nLast year his drive and enthusiasm re vitali sed the\nOverseas Students Sub-Committee; sent the Mountaineering Club rushing up the Alps, and initiated the conception of an I.C. Exploration Board to\ncontrol and encourage expeditions of I.C. students\nto remote corners of the Globe for scientific and\nsurvey purposes,\n2, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SOCIAL CLUBS COMMITTEE\nReally a power pilot of the U.L. Air Sqadron, Andy\nLevine joined the I.C, Gliding Club in time to crew in the British National Gliding Championships\nat Lasham, and participate in the I.C. Club's Tour\nLN T OFFICERS of Yugoslavia this summer. He is now able to shoot\na big line as the only U.L. A.S. pilot to have flown\na Russian-built P.0.2. through the Communist skies\nof Serbia. Aa President of Guilds' last year his\nfire and dash were summarily quenched in the N.E.C, horse trough after an abortive attempt to recapture\nHerbert. He had great difficulty in preventing the\nenraged Guildsmen from racing N.E.C. to the ground.\n3. THE PRESIDENT OF R.C.S. The face smiling cheerfully over the full colours\ntie is that of \"Bugs\" Guthrie, whose main interest\nhitherto has been rowing for the first VIII. As a prominent botanist, he has been suspected of connections with that now defunct subversive organ is ation, the 29 Club.(No more red feet, please).\n4. THE PRESIDENT OF MINES.\u2014\u2014\nGazing dreamily into the distance is another much\nmarried man, Hugh Huckin. His interests have been\ncars, women and rug ger probably not in that order.\n5. THE PRESIDENT OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE'S WOMENS Asso cia tion \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nThe girl on the left is none other than Maureen\nHawes, the president of I. C.W. A. She is actually\na chemist but it is rumoured that her interest in chemistry has migrated to Cambridge.\n6. THE PRESIDENT OF I.C.U. The happy nan in the middle is Jim Anderson, sometime President of R.C.S. and Captain of I.C. Soccer\nClub. For further scurrilous details see the Red\nIssue of FELIX.\n7. THE SECRETARY OF I.C.U. AND CHAIRMAN OF THE\nATHLETIC CLUBS COMMITTEE. \u2022\nStaring uneasily from the right of the picture is S. A. Kitchener, a man of immense versatility as\nindicated by his dual role. last year, then Captain\nof the I.C. Cricket Club, he scored a great personal\ntriumph with two magnificent centuries in the Club's unbeaten tour of Devon. While his activities are\nlargely sporting, we will never forget his appearance in a recent stage production of \"Orgia Romana\".\n\u00a3!je Sector's inaugural 8bb rest f,1955 The Inaugural Address of Dr. Linstead, Rector\nof Imperial College, was delivered in the crowded\nlecture theatre of the Royal Geographical Society\non Tuesday last under the Chairmanship of Viscount\nFalmouth. It was not less remarkable for its wit\nand elegance than for its plain commonsense, and its lucid exposition of the problems which confront us.\nOne left the meeting astounded by the breadth of the\nundertaking with which Dr. Linstead has to deal ;\nand one marvelled at the understanding he showed\nof it. At the moment the College produces one in thir teen science graduates, and one in nine technologists in the country; and is responsible for a greater\nproportion of higher degrees than any other establishment. The problem of finding students so that\nwe might expand without milking other Colleges would\nseem to be a big one. But Dr. Linstead has few dorf bts about this for two reasons: firstly the great public\ninterest shown recently in the teaching of science\n(which has led to an offer of military service deferment for science teachers); a nek secondly, the bulge\nin the school-age population wh icl r was brought about\nby the war (when the American Servicemen were stationed in Britain). In 1946 there were 1600,000 children in British schools-, by 1961 there should be\n2700,000 . Our present annual intake of undergraduates is500; but in1962, when we have 3000 Students (1600 undergraduates), only 600 per annum will have to be recruited: an increase of 17%. Dr Linstead\nalso hopes to reduce the wastage by failure. At the\nmoment 100 out of 500 annually fail their first year.\nA course will be established for \"sixth Arts\"\ntype people, so that in a single year, beginning\nwith a knowledge of mathematics, they may reach ordinary entrance level in Physics and Chemistry.\nLast year, our 631 P.G. s were 34% of the student body. In 1962 they will constitute 45% of the\nCollege. Of these, one third will be overseas stud-ents. Most of the rest will be I.C. men, but there\nwill be an increasing number of men from industry\ndoing short courses. There is still a great deal of\nmoney for the maintenance of P. Gs. The Rector hinted to the appropriate people in the audience that,\nwhile he would not ask for money today, \"there will be another day\".\nOn the broadening of our Education, the Rector\nregretted that the present three-year undergraduates\ncourse would not allow any non-scientific studies to be included in the formal curriculum. But extra-cur-ric u lar activities, of the type instituted by the\nlate Rector, Sir Roderic Hill, would be encouraged.\nAmid cheers, Dr. Linstead, reminding the student that\nhe is in London, asked him to\"expose himself to the\nbenign Influence of this most kindly of capital cities\" Dr. Linstead hopes that 300 students will be in residence by 1962 - and this will constitute 16% of\nthe College. At the moment the comparable figures are:\nout of London 28%, London 18%, I.C.8%. For the other\n84% Improved amenities, including a better Union\nLibrary, were promised. The Union building will be\nfinished in a year's time. While these developments\nare under way, the key is \"OPERATION SARDINE\". Those\ninstitutions which suffer inconvenience by our expansion may remember, as a solace, that we are having a very inconvenient time too.\nWhen the Rector finished his speech, Sir Grahame\nCunningham moved a vote of thanks, which was seconded\nby Jim Anderson.\nWe are given to understand that PHOENIX hopes\nto publish the complete text of the Hector's Address\nin the Autumn number. It will certainly provide food\nfor a great deal of thought, apart from being most\nwelcome.\nDINNER IN HALL\nDinner-in-Hall will be held on Tuesdays throughout this term, with the exception of October 25th., which is Commemoration Day. Bookings for Dinner\nshould be made in the Union Office, in Prince Consort Road not later than mid-day on Mondays.\nAn evening-dress Dinner-in-Hall will be held\non Wednesday, October 26th., before the Commemoration\nBall, and bookings for this Dinner commence on October 19th. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022For the Freshers: These Dinners are very good\nvalue, served with elegance, and what is more, the\nstudents at the College have an o port unity to talk on an equal footing with members of staff. As Jim\nAnderson said: \"Attend Hall Dinner as frequently as\npossible\".\nLAXB NEWS: THE MUST TWO FRESHERS DINNERS, WHICH WERE HELD\nOK MONDAY AHD WEDNESDAY, WERE THE SUCCESS OF THE YEAR SO\nFAR. IBT 03 HOPE THIS SPIRIT CtHTCNOES.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SPORTS NEW CROSSCOUNTRY Consteration in the changing rooms! Inman\nand Ansell are going out of training. This is but\none example of the magnificent keenness exhibited\nin the Club to date, We can only attribute it to an altruistic desire to encourage the Freshers.\nOr is there a rumour that the old -nen can't take\nit any more?\nWhatever the cause, the Club is certainly\npotentially better this year than for some year3 past. Our standard iri th out the fresher s is about the same as last year, and ive have some very\ngood fresher s. The Club trials at Petersham has certainly\nshown this, and there is more to come. More than\nthirty new names were added to the Club's potential\non Freshers' Day. At this rate we should be unbeatable in the University. Why not come along and\njoin us? You can have a race any Saturday or\nI' ed nes day, and we train in Hyde Park on Tuesday\nand Thursday lunch-hours.\nGOLFING ASSOCIATION\nThe average person's conception of a golfer\nas being a middle-aged business-man with more\n^i one y than sense, is rapidly becoming out of\nd>. te. Golfiug Associations, like the one at\nImperial College, are responsible for this\nchange. They cater for beginners, as well as\nexperienced players. Facilities are plentiful due\nto the cooperation of Highgate Club. Interested\npeople should contact D,F. Butters through the\nUnion letter rack.\ni.C. W.S.C. Has IOTA any good j apo spec ts for this session?\nCertainly anybody who vva.lt lo Harlington last Saturday\nwouldn't have said so- Seven ICWArians arrived for\nHockey \"trials\", among them only two fresher s. We may\nlose one of these to the University team. Where are the\nother five players.?\nThere is keen interest in Squash and at least two\nfresher s have shorn* promise.\nSeveral fresher s vent to take part in Netball,\nSv/j mr nj ri \u00a3\n, Table Tennis and Rowing, \"but as yet their ability\nis unknown.\nSOCCER With the influx of about sixty fresher s, the Soccer Club\nwould appear to have a very bright season ahead.\nA great deal of enthusiasm was exhibited at the\ntrials held on Wednesday and Saturday, the results of which\nproved most encouraging. Many of the Freshers showed considerable talent, and it is now obvious that competition\nfor a place in one of the four elevens will be very keen\nthis year.\nWe would like to paint out to the Freshers that it is\nextremely difficult for the Club Officials to select the\nbest talent from two afternoons of trials. Every year there\nare many players who start with the lower teams and finish\nup playing regularly for the first eleven.\nWe therefore ask you not to be disappointed if you feel\nthat you are playing for a team below your customary standard in your initial games shortly^ everyone will have his\nchance and the important thing is to get a lot of enjoyment\nfrom your football and contribute to the team spirit which\nhas always been associated with I.C, Soccer.\nWe wish all our members a happy and successful year.\nCANOE CLUB?\nThere ha* been a certain amount of unofficial discussion in the College concerning the formation of an I.e.. Canoe Club. It appears that many people are willing - nay\neager - to canoe, and are prevented only by lack of capital.\nWere a Canoe Club formed at I.C., we hope that there would\nbe no financial worries.\nBesides functioning throughout the session, canoeing\nholidays could, be arranged during the vacations. This, of\ncourse, depends largely on the initial success of the Club.\nSea-canoeing, river-canoeing, weekend Youth Hostel\ntrips- the soo pe is unlimited.\nIf anyone is interested, would they please contact the\nSports Editor,l?e lIx. If there is sufficient response,\napplication will be made to the A.C.C. for permission to\nform the Club.\nRUGBY The Rugby Football Club, invited by Vickers\nArmstrong, took part in a seven-a side tournament\nat Weybridge on Sunday October 2nd.A somewhat un-fit seven were spurred on b v itch and Tom, and\nplayed good Rugger to reach the final. By this time\nthey were on their knees, and they s uc combed to the\nvigour of a sustained Staines attack.\nImperial's star was Tony Palmer, scoring five out of the six tries by I.C. After two successful, trials, this year's Offi cia ls are faced with the usual difficult task of\nselecting teams for the opening matches on October\n15th. Judging by the number of keen fresher s on view\nthe Club can face its strong fixture list with con-fide n ce, and another good season's Rugger should be\nenjoyed by all.

As far as I know, there has been no group of philosophers in the College for years. I can not believe that\nthere is no interest.\nPhilosophy is the art of thinking about\nthe in demonstrable. What is consciousness, free\nwill, right and wrong, and God, if these exist ?\nWhat is the world we think we observe; does that\nexist ? These are not entirely ir rel event ques-t ions; the answers to some of them have formed\ni he basis of Communism, Capitalism, and Christ ian it y. If we are interested in these, we should\nbe interested in their roots too.\nAs a start, I am trying to run an inform-al open group meeting on Tuesday evenings; financially it will be under the S.C.H.. Gordon Phil lios, win has studied philosophy, has agreed to\ncome and talk about the thinking of some of the\ngreat philosophers, past and present.

Union Library.\nDcsir Sir 'The Union Library Committee wishes to\ndraw the attention of students to changes in the\norganisation of the Library. Many books have been\nstolen in recent years; last year over eighty,\nand it has been decided that the Library can now\nremain open only when a librarian is present.\nA member of the Committee is on duty\ndaily from 1 - 2 p.m., and Miss Bamford of the\nCity and Guilds Library from 2 - 5 p.m.. At\nother times it will be locked, although books may\nbe returned to Mr. James, the Ct0 Librarian.\nFreshers may care to note that the Union Library, which costs them nothing to join, is in an annexe of the Guilds Library, which is directly above Ayrton Hall Refectory. The library is well stocked with readable books, which we\nwill be very pleased to lend them.\nYours faithfully, A.R. BRAY.\nChairman, Union Library\nCommittee 1954-55.\n4th. October 1955.\nTo the Editor,\nDear Sir, Owing to the paucity of your present liter ary talent we feel bound to make a first contribution immediately:\nFirst, we would tender our heartfelt,\nthanks for the profuse words of welcome by Maoavity\n(FELIX p.4). Already we feel much less like \"out-casts\" and would be more than pleased to direct any\nperson to the nearest \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 . We feel that the\ninitial expenditure on FELIX was well justified and\nare each now the proud owners, of two copies.\nFour Resident FRESH WOMEN.\nDear Sir,\nOn reading the excellent \"Scrapbook for 1954\" in\nlast week's FELIX, I was struck by the absence of any reference to music in Imperial College. Mr. Macavity 3hould have\nknown better (however did you think up that name John?).\nMusic in I.C. really is a going concern, and this year we\nhave got off to a fine start with both Choir and Orchestra,\neach under their new conductors.\nAt the first Choir practice this term close on 90\npeople were pr\u00ab\u00ab\u00abnt, and we were able to give Broken Hoist\ngreat encouragement at the outset of her ne\u00bb. , m as Choir\nconductor. She will have to work us hard so that suitable\nmusic o an be given in the Albert Hall on Conmeau Day.\nAt present we have more female singers than male\nso we require more male members from I.C.,es pe oi ally tenors. Gentlemen, in case you still--hang back, think of the\nexcellent opportunity thus provided for social o on tao t amongst the fifty young ladies who Make up our sopranos\nand altos.\nChoir practices are held at 5-30 p.m. on Tuesdays\nin the Council Room, C.&G.

The Ball is put on by our own Onion Entertainments Committee, and apart from the fao t that numbers must\nObviously be limited to suit the spa oe available, it should\nbe within the financial reach of the average I.C. undergraduate (if such a person can be envisaged). But is it1 Aeon serva ti ve estimate of tee total cost cannot be less\nthan five pounds.\nThis estimate does not in o lude the cost of hiring\nevening dress if one has not got it. Ten shillings\nestimated for transport is not generous. Most evening\ngowns cannot be dragged around through the filth of the\nLondon Boaas and lubes and a taxi is required.\nOn the slender grants and heavily-taxed father's poo-ket, how many of us can really afford this extravagance ?\nAt the moment the numbers are limited by the price, and the\nsame type of parson goes every year. Would, it not be\nbetter if our Entertainments Committee stepped down from\ntheir pedestal of the Dorohester and held the dance in a less expensive, but never-the-less suitable place, say\nKensington Town Hall ? Also, sino e the event is of value\nto the Union, the Committee.=might purposely run it at a loss. Alternatively, if the Dorohester is prefer ed as\na pla oe more suitable for the occasion, the pr ioe of the\ntio ket a might be sub sidi sed by the Union so that they\nwould oost a guinea, and the numbers might then be limited by toe tio ket distribution.\nObviously, the arrangements for this year's Ball will\nhave to be accepted as they stand and the extra in con veni eno e of holding the fu notion on a Wednesday will have to\nbe endured. It is to be hoped that those who go will enjoy\nthemselves very much. Next year perhaps some of t those who would have liked to have gone this year will be able\nto afford ao he a per, but not an uno he ape ned. Commemoration.\n* SPORT! SPORT!

Should the Sooiety deo ide to discontinue\ntheir plays, the cultural fab rio of the Collage would\nroo e ive a severe blow, and I would appeal to you to give\nthe Society a greater measure of support when they return\nto their new theatre in the Unicn.\nWith the formation. of the Conservative and Socialist\nsocieties,this session has witnessed a resurgence of\nPolitics in the College. Six members of Parliament have\ntrudged up Exhibition Head this year, the highlight of the\nyear being a Forum organised by the two ao oie tie a in-conjunction with the Student Christian Movement and General.\nStudies.\nAH the religious societies report increased attendance at their meetings. The I.C. Christian Union publication \"Starting from Zero\" sold out by midday on the first\n3?- r>f publication, 600 copies being sold.\nThe S. C.M. Prayer Meetings are better attended and the\nJewish Sooiety report an increased interest in Judaism. The\nCatholic Society's outing to the Southern Cathedrals was\nenjoyed by many member- of the Union, as was tha lecture\n-.hey organised on Preemascairy.\nIn spite of the lack of a ooo mmo dati on, and the\ndisturbing influences of Carnivals the \"A\" team of the\nBridge Club won all its matches and gained the U.L. First\nDivision Championship, the \"B2\" team finished third in the\nSecond Division, and reached the Semi-Finals in the\nHospitals and Colleges Cup. At the British Universities\nBridge Congress, three out of the six events were won by\nmembers of Imperial College, no mean achievement for aol ub of 60 members.\nThe Chess Club have, on the whole, maintained last\nyear's high standard, and. hope to retain the Second\nDivision Cup. The Gliding Club have a new Slingsby\nSkvlark II together with a trailer, which should be flying\nby the end of this term. The Hostel is now the only pla oe of\nreside no e to have a Cro3s-Channel Dean, and Prank Irving' s flight will now go down in the epics of Gliding. This session\nha3 seen the commencement of tour grants to the Social Clubs\nCommittee, and the larger part will be put towards the cost\nof a visit by the Gliding Club to Yugoslavia.\nOur second tourists - the Mountaineering Club - are to\ngo on an Alpine Expedition.

In the Autumn Term we studied the\nfirst chapters of St. John's Gospel, the Spring\nterm was devoted to some of the claims of Christ\nrecorded in the same Gospel, and in the Summer\nTerra we read the Epistle to the Romans.\nIn November Mr. Martin .Burch was the host\nat a week end house party in Essex. This weekend\nof Christian fellowship was appreciated so much\nthat another house party was arranged in February,\nthis time Mr. Metcalfe Collier was our host.\nMany students came to the Botany Lecture\nTheatre at lunchtime on Mondays to hear the\nChristian Gospel from speakers including Rev.\nJohn Stott, Miss Murial Crouch, Mr, Montague\nGoodman and Mr. Metcalfe Collier.

These\nGentlemen were promptly given a bum's rush to the\ndoor, in which the Rector's wife net r row ly missed\nbeing knocked flat. The intruders having been dealt\nwith satisfactorily, the speeches were begun in relative quiet. Miss Mary Clarke, first and only female\nVice-President, proposed the toast of \"THE College\"\nin a speech that unfortunately did not carry to the\nback of the Hall. However, it had a most enthusiastic\nreception when declaimed later that night to a more\nselect group who drank whisky from china cups in the\nHarrington.\n\"The Freshers\" was proposed by \"Bugs* Quthrie, who observed\nthat his audie no eo ou ld be divided into the invited Ereahjsra,\nthe invited Club off io ers and the uninvited.

Gregory, replying for the guests, emphasised\nhow pleased they were with their reo ep tion, particularly Mr.\nMiler and Mr. Huokin. The beer having run out prematurely, because R.C.S. are very thirsty this year, all adjourned to the\nbar.

Accordingly,\n. he flew over the water, dived on a particularly fat frs h, an&, resisting the impulse to swallow it, deposited it at\nthe feet of one of the gulls* leaders. This'so surprised the \u2022\ngull that he quite forgot to peck at the little tern and no\nother gull dared to infringe on their leader's right to peck\nat an enemy first.
