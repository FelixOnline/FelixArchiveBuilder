He is a world famous\nkarate expert and the Chief\nInstructor of our affiliated\nJapanese organisation. As\nour special guest, he taught\nfor three hours, and everyone\nfrom beginners to black belts\nlearned a lot from his wisdom\nand authority and also had a\ngreat time.\nSensei Abe started learning karate in Japan when he\nwas 15 years old. He studied under the most respected instructors and went on\nto win many of the biggest\nnational and international\ncompetition titles. By the\n1990s, he had been appointed\nthe Technical Director of the\nJapan Karate Association\n(JKA), the original and most\nimportant Shotokan karate\norganisation.\nHe is now 66 years old and\nholds 8th dan, one of the\nhighest possible ranks in\nShotokan karate. This visit to\nEngland was planned around\nteaching just two classes, one\nof those at our club. We were\ntherefore obviously keen to\nmake the best impression we\ncould.\nWhile everyone was waiting to start, we were all very\nanxious to see what the class\nwould be like. The club\u2019s\nnew beginners in particular\ndidn\u2019t know what to expect\nand maybe started wondering\nwhat they had let themselves\nin for!\nSensei Abe started the lesson after he was welcomed\nand introduced to us by our\ninstructor Sensei Jim Lewis.\nHe ran the lesson in a traditional Japanese style, even\nteaching solely in Japanese,\nwith one of our black belts\nproviding translation. Huge\nthanks to Sanae for doing a\nbrilliant job!\nAt the start, some of the\nclub\u2019s beginners seemed to\nbe hiding at the back of the\nclass, but they bravely moved\nto the front once they were\nspotted. Some people may\nhave been slightly scared, but\nthey needn\u2019t have worried.\nSensei Abe is a great teacher\nfor all levels and helped each\nof the beginners individually,\nand gradually revealed that\nhis English is much better\nthan he first let on.\nThe lesson focused on\njust the basic techniques of\nkarate, yet Sensei Abe\u2019s very\nclear explanations gave a\nnew insight into how the various blocks, strikes and kicks\nwork, and why.\nSome new members had\nonly been to a couple of lessons before, but they kept up\nwith the rest of the club bril-liantly. Some even learnt up\nto five completely new techniques all in one session!\nThroughout the lesson,\nwe were all in awe of Sensei\nAbe\u2019s technique. His style\nwas not as flashy as some\ndemonstrations, but you could\nsee the skill in his speed and\nstrength, and his technique\nappeared perfect. He inspired\neveryone in the room to try\ntheir hardest throughout the\nwhole lesson.\nAfter the main lesson was\nan extra hour-long advanced\nclass for brown and black\nbelts. Sensei Abe focused on\nadvanced techniques and\nsome interesting new applications of the basics. We practised delivering each move in\nthe fastest, most natural and\npractical ways possible. This\ntraining has to be my personal highlight of the course.\nThis extra session also\nincluded studying two high\nlevel kata: set sequences of\nblocks, strikes and turns that\nare the traditional method of\nlearning karate. A lot of the\nbrown belts had never had\nthe chance to even try these\nkata before, so it was difficult to keep up with the black\nbelts. Even so, it was a lot of\nfun to try the more spectacular moves!\nAlsoatthecoursewasSensei\nSidoli 7th dan, the President\nof our British organisation.\nWhen the advanced lesson\nstarted, he volunteered to\nstay and teach the beginners\nthe first kata in what became\na much more informal ses-sion. Sensei Sidoli was very\nencouraging and the beginners loved the opportunity to\nask all their questions without\nfeeling self-conscious.\nOver the whole course, everyone enjoyed themselves\nimmensely and learned even\nmore about karate, thanks to\nexcellent teaching that shone\nthrough the translation.\nSensei Abe\u2019s unique style and\ngentlenaturewonhimaround\nof applause and a lot of praise\nat the end of the lesson. He\npassed on some of his karate\nsecrets to our club members,\nand we benefited from a truly\nenlightening experience.\nOf course, after three hours\nof training, we then took some\nbadly needed refreshments in\nthe bar!\nIf you might be interested\nin karate, it\u2019s certainly not\ntoo late to try. Beginners\nare always welcome, and\nwe still have new members\nstarting each lesson. If you\u2019d\nlike to know more, check out\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/acc/\nshotokankarate.\nAll lessons at our club\nare taught by Sensei Lewis\n7th dan, one of the highest\nranked karate instructors in\nthe country, with a highly distinguished karate career and\na lot of experience. We are\nvery lucky to have such a high\nranked instructor, not just\nbecause of his teaching, but\nalso because his reputation\nbrings the best in the world to\nvisit our club. Later this year\nthere will be the chance to\ntrain with another Japanese\nmaster, Sensei Mikio Yahara\n8th dan.\nICUSKC has three training sessions each week in\nthe Union gym: Monday 6-8pm, Thursday 8.30-10pm and\nSaturday 10am-12noon.\nTo get started, simply come\nalong to one of our sessions\nand start learning the art of\nShotokan karate. If you have\nany questions, you can email\nSimon at shotokan@ic.ac.uk.\nJapanese karate master at Imperial\nSHOTOKAN KARATE\nSensei Lewis 7th dan and Sensei Abe 8th dan (front row, from left) with a few Imperial\nCollege Union Shotokan Karate Club members\nBy Chris Mark\nBoots, rucksacks, manic\nexpressions and Sainsbury\u2019s\nwine cartons \u2013 yes, it must be\nthe Fellwanderers again.\nIt was Friday 29 October and\nour 12 heroes crammed themselves into a gleaming yellow minibus for a seven hour\njourney to the Lake District\n(that\u2019s the sticky-out bit just\nsouth of Scotland, before\nanyone asks). After a brief\ndetour across what felt like\nhalf of Lancashire, we finally\narrived at two in the morning,\nunloaded a mountain of kit\ninto a barn, mastered the gas-powered space heater wos-sname and crawled into our\nsleeping bags... just in time to\nbe up again to climb Scafell\nPike, the highest mountain\nin England at 987m (which\nmight not sound like much,\nbut when you\u2019re standing at\nthe bottom looking up it\u2019s an\nawful long way to the top!)\nAnyway, up we went, to\nbe rewarded with fabulous\nviews of the surrounding\nnational park and not-quite-so-fabulous views of Sellafield\nnuclear power station as a\nmalevolent white blob on the\nhorizon (remind me again\nwhy they had to build it in one\nof the most beautiful parts of\nBritain? Still, that explains\nwhy the local sheep glow in\nthe dark I guess).\nAfter a quick chocolate stop\non the summit and a quick\nlesson from El Presidente\n(Sarah) on the etiquette of\ndislodging rocks onto people\u2019s heads (it\u2019s quite alright\nas long as you shout some-thing, apparently), we were\noff again, scrambling onto a\nridge to the north and bagging several smaller peaks\nbefore looping back to\nWastwater where the minibus\nhad been strategically positioned by Andy next to the\npub. Surprising how drinking\nreal ale against a backdrop of\na flawless sunset can remind\nyou that London isn\u2019t the beall and end-all!\nThen it was back to the\nbarn for the aforementioned\nvegetarian curry, featuring\nthe intriguing combination of\ncashew nuts and cheese. After\nthe washing up had been sub-dued, it was time to break\nout the vino and play a few\nrounds of Werewolf, a bizarre\nand challenging game which\n(eventually) involved Cupid, a\nwooden spoon, an evil village\nmayor, and... er...werewolves.\nEnough said, I think.\nSunday morning was a bit\nmurkier than the previous,\nso we decided to catch the\nRavenglass-Eskdale steam\nrailway into the hills and then\nwalk back to the coast and\nthe minibus along Muncaster\nFell, a gentle unchallenging\nwalk which allowed some\ngood navigation practice\nalong with a brief debate on\nwhether sheep should be\nmarked on maps or not.\nThen finally there was the\nten hour return journey, skilfully planned to allow the\noverseas Wanderers a good\nview of spaghetti junction.\nAll in all, a fantastic weekend\n\u2013 roll on the next one!\nFELLWANDERERS\nBig hills and vegetarian curry\nThe Fellwanderers in the Lake District: \u201c987m might not sound like much, but it\u2019s an\nawful long way to the top!\u201d\n\n"

Now it is an era... he\nwill be no footnote to history;\ninstead he is making it\u201d said\nthe paper, who admitted that\nthey \u201cdon\u2019t like it one bit\u201d,\nand in that they were not on\ntheir own.\nThe Daily Mirror devoted the entire front page\nto one headline asking,\n\u201cHow can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?\u201d and The\nIndependent had the same\nsentiment, if a bit more tactfully put, in their montage\nof photos from Abu Ghraib,\nGuantanamo Bay and Iraq.\nMany commentators were\nsurprised and shocked by the\nemergence of \u2018moral values\u2019\nas the most important issue\nin the election; it seemed\nthat voters ignored their\nmisgivings about Iraq and\nthe economy to vote for the\ncandidate who felt the same\nway that they did about guns,\ngays and God. Nearly all the\npapers also ran some sort of\narticle on the \u2018Divided States\nof America\u2019 \u2013 the electoral\nmap showing Democrat coast\nlines and solidly Republican\ninland states, where it seems\nthat \u201capart from the fact that\nthey speak English and have\ntwo legs apiece, it is hard to\nthink of anything American\nconservatives have in common with European liberals\u201d\naccording to the Guardian,\nwhich claimed that the election was a moment for Tony\nBlair to step away from\nAmerica and towards Europe,\nwith whom we have far more\nin common than an electorate\nwho believe their country has\nbeen \u2018chosen by God\u2019.\nSome papers were pleased\nwith the result, however. The\nTelegraph thought that the\nresult would \u201cstrike fear into\nall enemies of America and\nthe West\u201d now it is clear that\nMr Bush has support from the\nAmerican public to continue\nhis task in the war on terror.\nThe paper urges Europeans\nto attempt to understand the\nAmerican people and therefore the President, and not\nto become complacent: \u201cThe\ncountry he leads is diverging\nfrom Europe: it is younger,\nmore self-confident, more\nprosperous, more devout,\nmore diligent, more democratic and, in short, more\nconservative. Europe must\ncome to terms not only with\nMr Bush, but with the nation\nthat has elected him. This is\na president who really can\nspeak for America\u201d.\nThe Sun took a similar\nline, put in the inimitable\nwords of Richard Littlejohn,\nwho ranted: \u201cMichael\nMoore, Osama bin Laden,\nSaddam Hussein, Jacques\nChirac, Gerhard Schroeder,\nKofi Annan, Yasser Arafat,\nthe BBC, Guardianistas,\nChannel 4 News, Robin Cook,\nClare Short, most of the\nparliamentary Labour party,\nhalf the Tory party, Charlie\nKennedy, your boy took one\nhell of a beating\u201d.\nThe Times took a more\ngrown-up line on the election than most of the other\nnewspapers, with the leader\nurging Mr Bush to use his triumph to push for peace in the\nMiddle East, which most pundits agree is the most urgent\nissue currently facing the\nPresident. Tony Blair joined\nin that chorus, stating in his\nfirst speech after the election\nresult that peace in Palestine\nwas \u201cthe single most pressing political challenge in our\nworld; we must be relentless in our war against terrorism and in resolving the\nconditions and causes on\nwhich the terrorists prey\u201d.\nGeorge Bush, however, did\nnot mention the Middle East\nin his acceptance speech.\nThe Independent picked up\non this, suggesting that Mr\nBlair must be praying that\nthe President does not decide\nto attack Iran, a situation that\nwould be nearly impossible\nfor Mr Blair to respond to\nwithout outraging either the\nAmericans or his own parliamentary party.\nFour more years\nReading the newspapers so you don\u2019t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at\nhow the national press responded to George W Bush\u2019s victory\n\u201cHow can\n59,054,087 people\nbe so DUMB?\u201d\nTriumphant: George W Bush, who will serve another four\nyears as President of the United States\nAgainst the war: protesters in London, including a contingent of Imperial College\nstudents, voice their feelings against one of Mr Bush\u2019s most controversial decisions\n\n"

It was a smallbore\nrifle match, shot indoors, at\n25 yards with teams of five\nshooting two cards totalling\n100 points each.\nWe met and set off from\nKings Cross, and all managed to get on the right train\ndespite someone not meeting\nus at the station! After about\n45 minutes of misty countryside and much talking, we\narrived in Cambridge.\nThe Cambridge range is in\na really weird place, under\na bridge, so weird that even\nthe taxi driver didn\u2019t know it\nwas there! When we arrived,\nwe were treated to a small\ntour of their really large\nrange. They have a huge\nclub room with a pool table,\na large 11 point rifle range,\nand a separate air weapons\nrange capable of holding\naround 15 people. It is no\nwonder with these facilities\nthat this is the Rifle Club\nthat not only won the BUSA\nRifle Championship but also\nproduced the last Queens\nPrize winner. To win the\nQueens Prize is considered\nto be the highest achievement in the rifle shooting\nworld.\nAdmittedly we were the\nunderdogs in this competi-tion. Some of our best team\nmembers could not make\nit (Tim decided that Clay\nPigeon shooting was more\nappealing) and that meant\nthat we had to use someone\nwho had not shot a rifle in six\nmonths.\nWe also had two beginners\nwith us. One of them, Fan,\nhad shot only once before,\nbut was willing to give it a\ntry and did really well. We\nwere also not using our own\nrifles, due to difficulties with\ntransporting weapons. This\nmeant that no-one was used\nto the rifles they shot with.\nThis gave the Cambridge\nshooters a great advantage,\nbut they were all impressed\nby how well we did. Despite\nour disadvantages, we had\na great shoot, and everyone\nreally enjoyed it\nIt is worth pointing out\nthat the highest scorer from\nCambridge achieved 195\nand the rest of their team\ngot scores above 189. The\nImperial College team would\nusually get above this on a\nnormal day, if not more. You\nwill be pleased to know that\nwe are intending to arrange\na return match, for them to\ncome and shoot in London,\nand then we will be able\nto beat them on our home\nground.\nAfter the match Isao,\nGary and Shan went back to\nLondon, while the rest of us\nenjoyed a formal dinner at\nEmmanuel College with the\nCambridge team. After lots\nof wine, a few table football\nmatches at the college bar\nand a random Greek party at\nDarwin College, we headed\nto bed. A fine day and evening\nwas had by all.\nImperial shoot at Cambridge\nSHOOTING\nNot a weapon in sight: shooters from Imperial College and Cambridge University together on matchday\n\n"

    "content": "Freshers trip 2004\nBy Jim Pullen\nThe Canoe Club\u2019s fresh-ers trip to Wales found a set\nof well-organised newbies\npacked and ready to go by\n6.45am \u2013 a new club record\nperhaps? Two minibuses\npositively overflowing with\nslightly worried looking fresh-ers set off from the Union in\na formula one style starting\nformation.\nThe journey up went with\nlittle incident and we were\nsoon past Birmingham and\nheading into the land of\nsheep. Rain was pouring\ndown at this point and the\nprospects of a great paddling\nweekend were high. Loads of\ncars laden with boats were\nspotted, including an irritating little one containing four\nblondes driving at 30mph and\ncausing a four-mile tailback.\nThe hut was reached a little\nafter midnight and drinking\nensued. Theo\u2019s job as chief\nfire-starter was usurped by\nLars and his scouting skills.\nIn no time, we had a roaring\nfire, which Lars blocked up\nwith drying wood (oh well).\nMost of the John Smiths was\nconsumed and then we headed to bed at around 3am.\nSaturday started with the\nfry-up sandwich at the ridiculously early time of 7am. We\nleft at 8.30 and arrived at the\nlake above the Glaslyn. Some\ninteresting warm-up procedures ensued, instigated by\nAlice and Paula, much to\nthe amusement of the passing road-sweeper. We got on\nthe lake and got people used\nto paddling on open water.\nApparently Nina had somehow missed the opportunity\nof a capsize drill in the pool,\nbut she soon made up for it\nby quickly jumping out of her\nboat and testing the water\ntemperature.\nAfter a small amount of\nfaffing around, we split into\nfour groups and proceeded off\ndown the river. Water levels\nwere very high, with the possibility of paddling in fields if\none chose to take it. Normal\ngrade 1-2 became 2-3 and carnage soon ensued with multiple swims from a few of the\npaddling newbies. The rapid\nnext to Beddgelert seemed to\ncause the most swims.\nEventually we got the swimmers out of the water and the\nboats were rescued further\ndownstream, much to the\namusement of the watching\ngrannies on the bridge.\nFurther swim-tastic fun\nwas had with much multi-col-oured plastic floating through\nBeddgelert. Once the first\nthree groups were down, we\ngot the minibus round and\nstarted sorting things out.\nNick\u2019s missing paddle was\nlocated (he\u2019d kindly lent it\nout and was paddling with a\nleftie), but there was no sign\nof Rob\u2019s group. After about an\nhour, three fifths of them paddled up, the other two having\nwalked out. Some discussion\nwas had as to what to do next\n(it still being only 1.00) and we\neventually left for the Llugwy\nwith much minibus manoeu-vring.\nBoth Plas-Y-Brenin and the\nget-out were rammed with\npaddlers, but we squeezed\nthe minibuses in somehow.\nUnfortunately, Lars decided\nto stand on the roof and help\nunload the boats, apparently\nnot caring that the rear of his\nclub wetsuit had now failed\ncompletely and exposed himself to passing traffic \u2013 the\nmental scars are still healing.\nWe got on the water in similar\ngroups and did a short paddle\ndown a 1km stretch, practising ferry-gliding and break-ing-in/out on the way down.\nThe section\u2019s best rapid\noccurred at the end, where a\nfriendly Aussie helped to fish\nCaroline out.\nAfter a little wait, the more\nexperienced paddlers went\non down to Cobden\u2019s falls.\nRob set up safety with Ralph\nand Theo bombing through\nit to fish people out at the\nbottom. I followed Mark and\nLars (this guy has no fear).\nLars swam on the chute\nabove the falls and I was\nforced to take evasive action,\nleaving Mark to fish him out.\nI ran the falls OK, much to\nmy relief after my only other\nattempt had gone so badly\nwrong. I then got out to watch\nthe swim-madness occurring.\nLars and Mark had somehow got themselves out on a\nrock above the falls and were\ngetting back on (Lars after\nhis second swim, Mark after\nscrambling out of his boat to\ntry and help). At this point\nClaire\u2019s inazone appeared\nupside-down and found a nice\nline down, with no sign of\nClaire (who had swam to the\nside further upstream).\nA couple of drinks in the\npub were very much needed\nat this point and some interesting debates were had by\nall. We got back to the hut and\nate large quantities of chilli\nthanks to the dedication of the\nchefs forsaking the pub. The\nancient tradition of climbing\nthe hut ladder was performed,\nwith yours truly being nominated to demonstrate by the\ndreadlocked wussy one. All\nthe freshers completed the\nchallenge successfully, with\nsome interesting (and somewhat dodgy-looking) new\ntechniques invented by Rob.\nAt this point I must confess\nto not being fully aware of\nwhat was going on, but for\nsome reason most of the girls\nremoved their bras (I seem\nto remember Rob putting one\non, but no surprise there).\nSunday morning started\nwith a few hardcore members getting up to watch Theo\nand Rob run the gorge. The\nrest of us arose somewhat\nlater and got breakfast and\nthe hut sorted out. We left at\n11 with some confusion as to\nwhat river had been decided\non, how the name was spelt\nand where it was. Eventually,\nwe gave up and went to the\nlower Mawwdach. We divided\ninto similar groups to the day\nbefore \u2013 without Peter (dodgy\nshoulder), Nina (dodgy knee)\nand Kai (dodgy cold) \u2013 and\ngot on the water.\nThe first rapid was a little difficult for the newbies\nand several swims resulted.\nWhilst rescuing a boat and\nswimmer, Ralph managed\nto lose his rather expensive\npaddles, resulting in a very\ngrumpy tree-hugging hippy.\nHe went back to the bus, got\nsome lefties and caught us\nup. Several nice grade three\nrapids were discovered (to\nthe complete surprise of Lars\nin at least one case) and a\nfew more swims occurred.\nFortunately for Ralph, I spotted his watersticks sitting in\nan eddy about halfway down\nthe run. People were definitely improving at this point as\nthey figured out that leaning\nupstream = cold + wet.\nSome confusion was had\nas to where the get-out was,\nwith myself and Ralph going\nfor a quick jog to find the\nminibus. Eventually, all four\ngroups ended up at the get-out together. It was a seriously steep mud and leaf\nbank, and some interesting\nrope techniques were used\nwhich involved Rob and Chad\nrunning headlong down the\nbank (securely harnessed to\nthrow-lines obviously), whilst\na boat went bumping up it.\nFinally the teamwork resulted in all the kit finding its way\nsuccessfully back in/on the\nbuses.\nGetting changed by the\nroad proved amusing with a\nlot of drivers taking a keen\ninterest in Claire (or possibly\nLars, we weren\u2019t really sure\nwhich was being hooted at).\nWe stopped for a quick fish\nand chip break in Welshpool,\nand some lead-footed action\nfrom the drivers meant that\nboth buses made it back for\nthe last tube.\nIf you\u2019re interested in trying\ncanoeing, join us at St Mary\u2019s\nPool on Tuesday nights from\n7pm.

Buying one of\nthese balloons will cost you\na comparatively cheap \u00a31.\nThe balloon that is found furthest away and returned to\nus will win a fantastic prize,\nwith further prizes for those\nin second and third places,\nand a prize for the location\nwith the strangest name (at\nmy discretion).\nRAG raid\nSaturday 27 November sees\nan invasion of London from\nseveral other university\nRAGs. Not wanting to miss\nout, we will be there and we\nhope you will be too.\nFor all of you who want\nto bring chaos to Central\nLondon, this is your chance!\nBoating in fountains, forming a giant conga in Trafalgar\nSquare, tiddlywinking down\nOxford Street, streaking\nthrough the Bank of England,\nblagging free items whilst\ndoing market research in a\nsex shop or anything else that\ncomes to mind \u2013 this is the\nday to do it!\nRAG Week 2005\nRAG Week has been confirmed as 7-13 February next\nyear. All the usual fun and\ngames is planned: a raid\nmidweek, the Monopoly pub\ncrawl to end the week, plus\nmany more events yet to be\ndecided! If you have an event\nin mind, then join us and\nmake it happen \u2013 just email\nrag@ic.ac.uk.\nNumber time\nThings have only just got\nstarted, but we have some\ncash coming in!\nFreshers Week made\n\u00a398.42, and tins in the Union\nshop have made a nice \u00a354.45\nfrom all your two pence coins.\nThe tins have been replaced\nwith empty ones, so keep giving us your coppers \u2013 it all\nadds up! The cloakroom at\nCommemoration Day made\n\u00a3300 through the hard work\nof a few volunteers, so many\nthanks to all of them. Finally,\nI would like to thank everyone who contributed to RAG\nvia my tankard last week in\nthe Union Bar, even if I was\ntrying to drink from it at the\ntime. \u00a33.13 does not improve\nthe taste of Abbot Ale but\nmight just improve the life\nof someone with cancer or\nAIDS.\nRAG\nRAG rundown (and some numbers)\nJust one of the ways you can help RAG bring chaos to central London (and raise money at\nthe same time): a volunteer conducts some \u2018market research\u2019\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 11 November 2004\nFILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\n15\nSpine-chilling horror, teeth-grinding\nsuspense and a dash of gore. This\nand plenty more is what you\u2019ll get\nfrom watching The Grudge, the new\nthriller brought to you by Sam Raimi,\nwhich had me cowering in my seat\nfor the whole of its duration.\nJust so that you get an idea, this\nfilm is very much in line with the\nother displays of modern Japanese\nhorror, as seen in Dark Water or\nRingu and the series of American\nremakes of foreign cult classics such\nas The Ring or Vanilla Sky. It seems\nlike Hollywood has seen potential\nin the foreign film markets and is\ninterested in getting a good slice\nof the benefits by remaking films\nthat have proved popular in their\ncountry of origin. The basic formula\nseems to be to select a good film,\nthrow some money at it, cast a hot\nHollywood lead (in this case read\nSarah Michelle Gellar) and shove it\nright back on the market. The result\nis usually a good film and significant\nrevenue.\nThe Grudge tells the story of Karen\nDavis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an\nAmerican student working at a care\ncentre in Tokyo. She seems happy,\nhas a job in a care centre, a nice boyfriend and speaks great Japanese.\nOf course this isn\u2019t going to scare\nanyone, so the writer decides to\nspice things up and sends her off to\ncare for a mysterious old lady that\nspends all day in a daze. Unluckily\nfor Karen, the lady\u2019s house turns out\nto harbour a terrible curse.\nYou see, legend has it that when\nsomeone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born that gathers\nin the place of death and those who\nencounter it will be consumed by its\nfury. Bad news for Karen, but good\nnews for horror movie buffs and\nanyone who fancies a fright.\nSeriously, mark my words, this\nfilm is scary. I consider myself to\nbe a pretty brave kinda guy, but this\nmovie actually made people scream\nin the theatre on several occasions.\nMay I also add: never has the sound\nof a burp been so terrifying.\nThis won\u2019t be winning any awards\nin a hurry, though. Even though\nthe original idea is solid, the story\ndevelopment is a bit poor. The main\nproblem is the lack of character\ndevelopment. The story unfolds as\na mixture of scenes and flashbacks\ncorresponding to different points\nwithin the timeline, resulting in a\nseries of characters that get introduced and killed off within minutes.\nThis, added to some unconvincing\nacting, renders it quite difficult for\nthe audience to establish a solid\nbond with any of the characters.\nThe Grudge is also slightly repetitive and you\u2019ll find yourself guessing\nwhat is coming next. However, this\nis probably what makes the atmosphere so terrifying throughout the\nfilm: the fear of what\u2019s coming. The\nmovie is all about psychological horror and you\u2019ll find yourself completely absorbed each time someone\ngoes up the winding staircase or\nwalks down the claustrophobic hall-way. The director has elevated the\nart of \u2018scaring the hell out of you\u2019 to\na whole new level.\nThen again, he has made the film\nenough times to get the balance\nright. The Grudge is not just an\nAmerican remake of a Japanese hit\nfilm. Shimizu had previously written and directed Ju-on: The Grudge\nin Japan as a remake of a couple\nof straight-to-video releases based\non the same concept. The videos\nwere, in turn, inspired by a short\noriginal film, released back in 1998.\nA total of five films all based on the\nsame original idea have granted the\ndirector complete control over your\nbowels. Each noise, each camera\nangle, each sudden volume rise is\nperfectly timed and will have you\nlooking over your shoulder on the\nlonely walk home.\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a scary\nmovie that will get your new girlfriend to cling on to you for protec-tion, beware: you may find you\u2019re\nnot that brave either.\nIgnacio Quinones\nCan you hold a Grudge against this?\nIt never forgives. It never forgets\nThe Grudge\nDirector: Takashi Shimizu\nStarring: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jason\nBehr, Bill Pullman\nLength: 92 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHI\n\u201cTastes like chicken...\u201d\n\u201cLegend has it that\nwhen someone dies\nin the grip of rage, a\ncurse is born...\u201d\n\u201cRight. Who farted?!\u201d\nThe ultimate sacrifice\nTo coincide with Armistice Day 2004, Oliver Finn tells us about the war novel that you must read\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThursday 11 November is Armistice\nDay 2004. On this day in 1918, the\n\u2018war to end all wars\u2019 finally came\nto an end; the guns which for over\nfour years had pounded the soldiers of both sides finally fell silent.\nAssociated with this date in is\nthe Royal British Legion\u2019s poppy\nappeal, inspired by the vast fields\nof poppies that grow on the battlefields of Europe. Armistice Day\nis not just about giving to charity;\nit is a memorial to those who have\nlost their lives in service of their\ncountry.\nWar is a terrible thing. Today\u2019s\nmedia goes to great length to display the dozens or hundreds of\ncasualties occurring in current conflicts around the world. In the First\nWorld War, the casualties were not\ndozens, hundreds or even thou-sands, but millions of men, some\nonly boys, of various nationalities lying across the battle lines\nthrough France, Belgium and the\nNetherlands. The sheer scale of\nslaughter occurring at battles such\nas Paschendale, The Somme and\nYpres is hard to comprehend. What\nthose few living veterans parading\npast the Cenotaph in London this\nweekend went through just cannot be fully understood by someone\nwho was not there.\nIn All Quiet on the Western Front,\nthe author endeavours to give readers some idea of what these men\nwent through. It is not a book of\naction, adventure and heroics. It\nis not a Hollywood tale of drama\nand flag waving. The book tells the\nstory of a group of friends who\nleave their school after a patriotic\nspeech by their teacher to sign on\nin the German army. It follows one\nof the boys from his initial training\nthrough to his experiences in the\ntrenches; and in disturbing detail\ndescribes the carnage and the\ndeath of the front lines in World War\nOne. The book is quite simply the\nmost moving that I have ever read\n\u2013 at several points it brought tears\nto my eyes.\nIn one scene, the soldier is pinned\ndown in a shell crater in no man\u2019s\nland with an enemy soldier whom\nhe has just bayoneted. Unable to\nmove on, the main character can\nonly watch the man in front of him\ndie slowly.\nThe power of the story lies in the\nway you can easily see why the character feels how he does. Because of\nthe way the story is told, it makes\nyou put yourself in the place of the\nunknown soldier and causes you to\nthink how you would react and feel\nin the same situation.\nAll Quiet on the Western Front\nwas first published in 1929 and\nseen as one of the most compelling anti-war arguments ever writ-ten. Shortly after its publication,\nthe book was made into a film.\nAfter reading it, you can see some\nsmall measure of what happened on\nthose bloody fields so long ago.\nThe haunting notes of the last post\nplayed at memorials around the\nworld will for me, and probably any\nreader of this book, never be the\nsame again.\nEveryone should read this book.\nIt promotes respect for those who\nhave fallen, understanding for\nother servicemen and women, and\nprovides a wakeup call to those of\nus who still think that war is \u2018fun\u2019\nand whose perceptions come from\nglorified Hollywood propaganda.\nThe book is like Saving Private\nRyan, but with ten times the\nrealism.\nAll Quiet on the\nWestern Front\nErich Maria Remarque\nHHHHH\n\u201c... like Saving\nPrivate Ryan, but\nwith ten times the\nrealism\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "The joy of... STV\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 11 November 2004\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nTV is rubbish these days\nAs a student, your finances are\nprobably tight. You have to budget\nfor everything, so you would probably be forgiven for missing out on\ncertain things. One thing that nearly\nalways gets left by the wayside is\nyour TV Licence (and I don\u2019t blame\nyou, given the rubbish they put on\ntelly these days).\nHowever, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware,\nyou could be fined up to \u00a31000 if\ncaught without a licence. Just to\nmake things easier, you might face a\ncourt appearance as well!\nThere are some myths that float\naround about TV licences. I am not\nwriting this to tell you to get one, but\nthis article is intended to tell you the\nfacts and your rights if the men or\nwomen in the detector vans come\nknocking at your door.\nIf you look at the TV Licensing\nAgency (TVLA) website, you might\nthink they are trying to explain\nthings to six-year-old kids, not grown\nadults. Anyway, here are some facts\nthat may help you:\nWhen do you have to buy a TV\nlicense?\n\u25cf If you use a TV that is currently receiving programmes, you will\nhave to get a licence. You\u2019ll also\nneed one if you are using anything\nelse to receive programmes, such as\nPCs or video recorders.\n\u25cf If you are living in halls and\nhave a TV in your own room then\nyou need your own separate TV\nlicence.\n\u25cf If you live in a house which has a\njoint tenancy then only one licence\nis required for the whole house.\nHowever, if there is a separate tenancy for each room then each room\nthat has a TV will need a separate\nlicence.\nThere is some good news though.\nAs a student, you are entitled to\nsome money back for the summer\nmonths if you can prove that you are\nno longer residing in the house that\nthe licence was bought for.\nThose nice people at TV Licensing\nalso target heavy student-populated\nareas, which is nice of them considering that some students can\u2019t even\nafford to put food on their plate let\nalone pay a \u00a31000 fine.\nWhat are your rights?\n\u25cf You are under no obligation to\nallow a TV Licensing enquiry officer\nto enter your home unless he/she\ncan show a search warrant.\n\u25cf If you open a door and the enquiry\nofficer does not have a warrant and\nstarts questioning you, you do not\nhave to answer. Basically just say\nnothing and shut the door.\n\u25cf If an enquiry officer tries to enter\nyour home without a warrant, this\nis unlawful.\n\u25cf The TVLA have to apply to the\nmagistrates\u2019 court to get a warrant\nto search your property. This can\ntake a bit of time, although it will\ncertainly be given.\n\u25cf If it gets to the point where they\nwant to search your home, you have\nthe right to see the warrant and\nask for a copy. They are allowed\nto search your property without a\npolice officer present, however in\nmost cases the search is conducted\nin the presence of a police officer.\nYou are allowed to ask for a copy of\nthe police officer\u2019s search warrant\nas well.\n\u25cf If you do get fined, there are payment plans available to you. Contact\nthe Union Advice Service for advocacy and more information.\nIf you have any further questions,\nor you are just interested in the\nissue of students and TV licens-ing, please contact the Union\nAdvice Service on 020 7594 8067 or\nadvice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nInnumerable people have stopped\nmeinthestreetsofSouthKensington\nrecently to ask, \u201cSam, what\u2019s all this\nabout Single Transferable Voting?\nWhat\u2019s wrong with just putting an\n\u2018X\u2019 next to the candidate I prefer?\u201d A\nvery good question indeed, and one\nthat I shall attempt to answer here.\nThe Single Transferable Vote\n(STV) is a system that has been\ndeveloped to give the voter more\npower than in the traditional \u2018first\npast the post\u2019 system favoured in\nUK General Elections. STV is a form\nof preferential voting, which means\nthat instead of casting a single vote\nfor a single candidate, a voter can\nexpress a list of preferences. Votes\nare cast by putting a \u20181\u2019 next to the\nvoter\u2019s preferred candidate, a \u20182\u2019\nbeside their second favourite candidate and so on, until they no longer\nwish to express a preference.\nWhen it comes to counting the\nvotes, a quota is calculated which\nsets the number of votes a candidate must attain to be elected. This\nis simply the total number of votes\ncast, divided by one more than the\nnumber of candidates to be elected,\nplus one vote. By following this for-mula, no more than the required\nnumber of candidates can reach the\nquota. Votes are counted according\nto the first preferences, and any\ncandidates who have achieved the\nquota are elected.\nTo decide which of the remaining\ncandidates are elected, the votes\nare transferred from candidates\nwho have more than the necessary\nnumber to achieve the quota and\nfrom the candidate with the least\nnumber of votes. This means that\nwhere the first preference of a voter\nwas not able to be used to elect a\ncandidate (or not necessary, in the\ncase of a candidate who has reached\nquota), their subsequent preferences come into play. This process of\ntransferring votes continues until\nthe required number of candidates\nhave attained enough votes to be\nelected.\n\u201cIt sounds like an awful lot of\neffort! So, what\u2019s the point of STV?\u201d\nthey may retort. Well, it\u2019s not that\narduous to think about who your\nsecond or third choice candidates\nare, and remember, you can stop\nwhen you have no further prefer-ence. The main benefit of STV is\nthat it avoids wasting votes in socalled \u2018safe seats\u2019, where one candidate might be streets ahead of\nthe others \u2013 in this case, the second\nchoice candidates will make a real\ndifference. Or, similarly, you may\nwant to back a candidate who ends\nup getting eliminated \u2013 your vote\nwould not be wasted, as your next\npreference will be reallocated to a\ncandidate who\u2019s still in the race. All\nin all, it empowers the voter.\nThe second question I\u2019ve been\nasked is \u201cwho\u2019s RON?\u201d Re-Open\nNominations, or \u2018New Election\u2019 is a\nway of expressing your displeasure\nwith the remaining candidates, and\nrequesting that nominations are\nreopened for a new election. The\nreason we are holding these by-elec-tions is because RON did well last\ntime, knocking out many \u201chuman\u201d\ncandidates.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that\nvoting for New Election is not the\nsame as abstaining. Various people\nhave said to us that they didn\u2019t know\nany of the candidates, but wanted to\nensure that the 25p donation went\nto their club, so just voted RON. In\nresponse to feedback from various\nquarters, we have decided to modify\nthe voting system to introduce the\n\u2018Abstain\u2019 option this time. The analogy for a paper ballot election is\ngoing into the voting booth and writing \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d on your paper,\nor spoiling the ballot slip in some\nother way. If you do this, your vote\nwill not count towards the election,\nbut you will be able to make your\ndonation.\nWhat am I trying to say? Voting\nmatters (more than doughnuts do),\nand you should get involved in the\nrunning of your Union. Nominations\nclose at noon tomorrow (Friday), so\nit\u2019s not too late to stand. Hustings\nare being held in the JCR at noon\nnext Thursday, 18 November, so\ncome along and quiz the candidates!\nFor more information, please see\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nUNCLE SAM\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nRadio to the power of Four\nWhilst writing this column I happen to be listening to the Today\nprogramme in my office. What is\nToday, some of you might ask?\nToday is BBC Radio 4\u2019s flagship\nnews programme. It is the most\nwidely heard breakfast news radio\nshow in the UK. There\u2019s a good reason for that.\nMany of you might stare aghast at\nthe mention of Radio 4 in a students\u2019\nnewspaper. Many seem to consider\nit the radio station for old fuddy-duddies. The fact is, however, that\nRadio 4 represents the crown jewels of the BBC\u2019s license fee funded\nprovision.\nFirstly, Test Match Special is the\nonly practical way to keep up with\nthe cricket (it\u2019s far too tedious a\ngame to actually watch most of the\ntime). More importantly, we are the\ngeneration least likely to watch tel-evision. How are we to keep up to\ndate with current affairs without\ntelevision news?\nSeveral people have suggested newspapers to me \u2013 and they\ncertainly have their place. But in\ntoday\u2019s internet age, newspapers are no longer really about\nbreaking news. The strength of a\ngood newspaper (such as Felix)\nis actually providing comment on\nthe major matters of the day. The\nhallmark of a bad newspaper\n(such as London Student) is\nto simply recycle what more\nup to date forms of media published hours, days (or in LS\u2019s case\nmonths) ago.\nSome people point to the internet and say that\u2019s the way to keep\nup to date. But that\u2019s really too\nmuch effort. One can\u2019t spend all\nday reading BBC News Online.\nPersonally I find the internet\nmore convenient for reading newspaper articles that I\u2019m interested\nin (again comment, not news). The\nonly news I get off the web is inter-net/technology related news. But\nthen Slashdot.org isn\u2019t really for\neveryone.\nNo, in this day and age, radio has a\nserious purpose. It\u2019s so much easier\nto listen to radio and absorb it whilst\neating/sleeping/working, etc. That\u2019s\nwhy Radio 4 is so important. For\nthe post-TV generation, a pervasive\nintelligent speech radio station is\nessential for an information society\nto work.\nWhy am I talking about this?\nSeveral reasons. Firstly, it\u2019s my job\nto keep abreast of issues that affect\nstudents, and listening to Today\nis basically how I keep abreast of\npolitical matters (whether they\nbe tuition fees or something more\nobscure like immigration rules that\ncould affect overseas students).\nSecondly, I like Radio 4 and wanted\nto tell everyone. Thirdly, I wanted to\nplug intelligent speech on your radio\nstation. Tune into IC Radio (www.\nicradio.com) and listen to Fireside\nfor my (almost weekly) phone-in\nwith the Felix editor on Thursdays\nat 6pm.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

To be honest, it\nwas about time we beat the\njailbirds after letting them\nleave with three points on\ntoo many occasions in the\npast. And beat them we did,\nin convincing fashion.\nWe hit them hard from the\npush back and were camped\nin their 25 for the whole first\nhalf of the game. The score in\nfact could have been 10-0, but\nwe thought it best to spare\nRoyal Holloway any embarrassment and just pop in a\ncheeky two.\nThe first goal came from\nChardonnay, as she followed\nup a great cross from DJ\nFlush. This was Chardonnay\u2019s\ndebut goal for the firsts, and\nthe whole team could not help\nbut join in her elation. There\nwas a definite few minutes\nof very girly jumping up and\ndown and screaming before\nwe decided to resume play.\nNot long after, Moonie (man\nof the match) scored a second\ngoal for Imperial. The pass\ncame from Anticlimax, who\nused some nifty stick skills\nto flick the ball past the oppo-sition. These skills clearly\nwowed the keeper who then\ncalculated that the only way\nto stop the impending goal\nwould be to run into Moonie\nat full speed... but it didn\u2019t\nwork, she still scored!\nAlthough it is not reflected\nin the scoreline, Imperial continued to dominate in the second half. In fact, so much time\nwas spent in the opposition\u2019s\nhalf of the pitch that Tyson\nhad to work hard to keep our\ngoalkeeper Spanner awake.\nRoyal Holloway tried their\nbest to taste a slice of the\ngoal pie, but their efforts were\nto little avail. One player even\nattempted to take her frustration out on poor Womble.\nFortunately, she\u2019s a hard nut\nand can take it.\nAs the final whistle declared\nwe had achieved our first win\nof the season, the excitement could not be contained.\nPeople were crying and hugging each other all over the\nplace... well, not quite, but we\nwere very pleased!\nBig thanks go to Spellcheck\nfor taking on the big yellow\nfun bus and especially for\nstopping at McDonalds on the\nway home.

My reward for getting\nthrough the application and\ninterview (it helped that I\nhad done UROP the previous\nsummer) was a nine week\nplacement in the Sharp physics laboratory, which gave me\nthe opportunity to experience\nthe black art of theoretical\natomic physics.\nGiddy with the feeling of\npost-exam exhilaration, and\nexcited at the prospect of\ndoing some real world sci-ence, I arrived with four other\nImperial students (Darwin,\nHudaa, Pan and Chris) in\nNewark, Delaware with some\nsense of expectation. We were\nnot to be disappointed.\nDelaware is a greenish state\nwith many highways between\nsmall cities, but with the\nfriendliest people \u2013 and this\nwas epitomised by the staff\nof Delaware\u2019s Undergraduate\nResearch Program. An example of this endemic friendliness is that if we were ever\nin need, they would fix it for\nus, so when I mentioned offhand that there was no kettle,\nwhat did I find the very next\nmorning outside my door,\nbut a brand new kettle! The\ncampus had a similarly nice\nfeeling to it \u2013 there were long\ngreen lawns, without signs\nsaying that you can\u2019t walk on\nthem, a bell tower that played\nparochial melodies, and all\nthe campus buildings were\nbuilt in the same grand style.\nFor the first seven weeks\nwe lived in dorms \u2013 each\nwith an American roommate\n\u2013 alongside other like-mind-ed souls trying to embellish\ntheir CVs. It was easy to make\nfriends and we had a lot of fun\ntogether in various bars and\nrestaurants. We also enjoyed\nthe activities organised by\nthe UROP representative in\nour hall. Due to Delaware\u2019s\nlocation, day trips followed\nto New York, Washington,\nPhiladelphia and also the\nbeach at Rehoboth (my personal favourite).\nWe were also there for the\nIndependence Day celebrations and the mourning of\nRonald Reagan, so we got a\nnice big dollop of American\nculture. Speaking of dollops,\ntheAmericansenjoytheirfood\n\u2013 especially their fast food!\nHowever, I have to pay tribute to the great Philly chees-esteak, which is now possibly my favourite pick-me-up.\nAmericans also like to keep fit\n(honestly), so take note of the\nfree gym and indoor/outdoor\npools on campus.\nI also managed to accomplish a lot of work! My supervisor understood my relatively novice position so with the\ntasks assigned to me within\nmy limits, I found myself in\na very stress-free position. I\nlearnt practical skills on the\nprogramming side and how\nto research topics, and a lot\nabout a researcher\u2019s life in\nthe US. I also made a lot of\nmates out there who I keep\nin contact with, bringing me\nto possibly the most exciting\npart of the exchange program\n\u2013 the home stay.\nFor the final two weeks, I\nstayed with Susan (a sweet\nmiddle-aged woman who\ndid her utmost to keep me\nentertained) and her family\nin Newark who had been kind\nenough to open their arms\nto me. Initially petrified by\nthe prospect, this part of the\nexchange really gave me an\nopportunity to learn more\nabout American culture, and I\nsuppose that is the thing that\nI miss most \u2013 the friendliness\nof everyone wanting to show\nme their part of the country.\nI would thoroughly recommend it to everyone!

Listen to some music, read notes\n7pm Have dinner, usually a plate of rice with a couple of fried chicken drumsticks and a salad\n9pm Go down the pub and have a couple of pints with some friends. Come back and watch an episode of Columbo from the newly released DVD\nRosie Taylor, Felix Science dietician says...\nStudent total calorific intake: 2500 calories Recommended (male) calorific intake: 2500 calories\nDarius eats on the run, grabbing fast food as a means of filling a gap. He does well to eat regular meals and snacks, not missing meals or eating huge\namounts in one go. This means that he is getting a regular supply of energy throughout the day.\nOne slice of white toast and jam for breakfast isn\u2019t enough. He would be better off having some low glycaemic index carbohydrates such as porridge or\ngranary bread. His lunch is lacking in vegetables. As we should all be consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, lunch is a good time to incorporate a portion. He does better with his evening meal, including a salad.\nHis diet is also lacking in fruit. Fruit would provide an ideal mid-afternoon and 5pm snack.

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nThe first time I went to Turnmills, I\nwasn\u2019t that impressed. The people\nseemed rude, it felt overcrowded,\nthe main dance floor felt too much\nlike a corridor and the cloakroom\nwas more expensive than the only\nother big club I\u2019d been to at the time,\nHeaven. Since that fateful night how-ever, the \u2018Mills has grown on me, and\nI now count it as one of my favourite\nvenues, easily amongst the best in\nLondon.\nIt\u2019s a joy to wander around, with a\nseemingly endless supply of nooks\nand crannies to squeeze yourself\ninto, absolutely loads of space to sit\ndown, chat and people-watch, millions of bars, great d\u00e9cor and at least\nthree separate rooms to check out.\nAnd that\u2019s before you even get to the\nawesome main room.\nAt the peak of the night, when\nall the drinkers have gone home to\nleave more space for the dancing\nhardcore, it is a joy to behold and be\npart of. Lowish ceilings, excellent\nsound filling the intimate space and\nsurrounding you, dark with the faint\nsmell of the smoke machine hanging\nin the air and the mythical Turnmills\nlight show (I have never thought it\nto be overly impressive in terms of\ncontent, but it\u2019s always has an outstanding effect) including London\u2019s\nfirst ever multicolour laser (sadly,\nnot in use tonight) in full swing, you\ncan\u2019t help but dance, and neither can\nthe 999 people next to you. Throw in\na shedload of quality music played\nby the world\u2019s most respected DJs\nand you have the perfect recipe for\nthe perfect night.\nWhich is why, in days when a promotion is lucky if it gets to its first\nbirthday, the Gallery has been entertaining London\u2019s sophisticated club-bers on a weekly basis for ten years.\nThis fact alone should give you some\nindication of the quality on offer. That\nnight, I was going to be introducing\none of my new classmates to the joys\nof London clubbing and so I couldn\u2019t\nthink of anywhere more appropriate\nor reliable than the Gallery in which\nhe should take his first steps into a\nwhole new world.\nWe arrived early and paid the\nexceptionally student-friendly price\nof \u00a310, and we didn\u2019t even have to\nask. The bouncers asked if we were\nstudents, we flashed our swipe cards\nand got tickets with 33% off the usual\nentrance fee. No fuss and friendly bouncers \u2013 brownie points for\nTurnmills already.\nWalking down the steps and into\nthe bar we realised we were pretty\nmuch the first people there, apart\nfrom the DJ and his guests, and\nso took the opportunity to have a\nproper nosey around. Everywhere\nwas empty and the rooms looked\ntiny with no-one in them. Still, this\nwas a good chance to get served\nquickly at the bar and then sit down\nfor lots of chatting to randoms and\npeople-watching. Did I mention\nthat the people at Turnmills are\nexceptionally friendly?\nThe only gripe I have ever had\nwith the place is that they insist on\nnever displaying set lists, so you\nhave no idea who is playing or when\nto expect them. It seems like a minor\npoint, but in an age of faceless DJs\nit\u2019s hard to know who you are listening to and so who to look out for in\nthe future. If you are reading this Mr\nStix, can you do something about it?\nJust a sheet on the door to the DJ\nbooth would be fine. Thanks!\nSo, I don\u2019t know who was playing for\nthe first couple of hours I was there,\nbut they were good. Chunky, techy\nhouse with a sprinkling of (deep\nbreath) prog, it was great for winding up to, and they played Sabotage\nby the Beastie Boys \u2013 more brownie\npoints to Turnmills.\nAfter that, I think Corvin Dalek\nplayed, followed by Tall Paul and\nJohn \u201800\u2019 Fleming, and then I assume\nGavyn Mitchell, mainly because\nthe last few times I\u2019ve been to the\nGallery, Gavyn has played the final\nset of the night. Corvin and Paul may\nhave been the other way around, I\ndon\u2019t know for sure. Whatever happened though, it was all good.\nThere were quite a few hours of\nuplifting house music to start with.\nI don\u2019t really know my tunes or subgenres so I can\u2019t expand further,\nbut I did hear a wicked remix of\nDelerium\u2019s Silence, and Cohen vs\nDeluxe\u2019s Just Kick! The rest was\nfun, but a complete mystery to me.\nAt around 4am, John Fleming\ncame on. I\u2019m pretty sure it was him\nbecause all of sudden things were\ntrancey \u2013 I do know trance, and John\nplays trance. It wasn\u2019t your usual\nuplifting\u201c\u2019CrasherTrance\u201d\u00a9though,\nit had a much darker, underground,\ntribal feel to it. I would use the word\nprogressive if I wasn\u2019t so scared of\nit and its connotations. Despite this,\nhis set went down extremely well, as\nin fact did all the others, and since\nby now there was much more space\non the dance floor, everybody spent a\ngood two hours jumping around with\ntheir arms in the air.\nI should also mention at this point\nthat while all this was going on in\nthe main room, things got utterly funked up in the second room.\nTonight, Sarah Main (Pacha\u2019s star in\nIbiza) was the big cheese in charge\nof the floor, and the back room of the\nGallery is now just as big a pull as\nthe main room acts themselves. Nic\nFanciulli has seen his popularity skyrocket in recent times thanks to his\nback room residency with Fandango\nand, in fact, the incredible sound system in the back room is there thanks\nto him. There is also the room at the\nfar end of the club which serves as\na chillout area with live acts, DJ\u2019s,\nambient techno and plenty of ran-doms to talk to.\nAnd so to the final set of the night,\nwhich in my experience is usually\none of the best. Much, much room\nto dance thanks to the lightweights\ngoing home, and a nice big chunk\nof driving hard trance to give you\nthat final rush of energy, before\nyou have to stumble onto the tube.\nUnfortunately, and to my eternal\nshame, I didn\u2019t make it past 6.30am\nthis time (I\u2019m out of practise), but\nthe first half hour of the last guy\u2019s\nset was promising. Heavy and beat\ndriven, large techno undercurrents with sprinklings of euphoria,\nquiet bits, loud bits, fast bits, slow\nbits (mostly fast bits) and plenty of\nopportunities to enliven those dancing shoes that you thought would be\nleaden by now.\nAll in all, another fantastic night\nout at Turnmills \u2013 friendly faces,\ngreat music, hilarious chats. Totally\nreliable without being predictable,\nand all for a bargain \u00a310 before\n11.30pm.\nDom Farrell\nTurnmills for a tenner\nVOLUNTEERS NEEDED!\nWhy not get active in the community whilst you\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege London?

    "content": "You thought the last movie was happily ever after? You thought wrong!\nAs with the first film, The Edge\nof Reason is based on the novel by\nHelen Fielding organised as a diary\nby Bridget, a London-based \u2018singleton\u2019 and (high-flying) journalist with\nan often disastrous social life and\nan unfortunate capacity for alcohol,\ncigarettes and calories.\nThe story picks up four weeks\nafter the first film ended, and we find\nBridget (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) where\nwe left her, blissful and besotted in\nthe arms of her gorgeous lawyer\nMark Darcy (Colin Firth).\nHowever, after six weeks the\ncracks are starting to show and she\nfinds his habit of folding underpants\nsimply too hard to bear. Are his\nupper-class background and schooling at Eton, which she describes\nas \u201ca fascist institution where they\nstick a poker up your arse and\nyou\u2019re not allowed to remove it for\nthe rest of your life\u201d going to drive\nthem apart?\nBridget\u2019s petty jealousies are also\nstarting to get the better of her, and\ntheir relationship. Among these is\nher suspicion about Mark\u2019s long-legged intern, who, on top of being\nsuper-slim, has a knack for doing\neverything right. Cue Bridget\u2019s\nformer boss, womanizing heartthrob Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant),\nundergoing sex therapy, but has he\nreally changed?\nSo Bridget is back to that same\nquestion: Mark Darcy or Daniel\nCleaver? And what could be better\nthan having those two fighting over\nyou?\nWe also see the return of chain-smoking, ever caring, crazy singleton friends who are always on hand\nto offer relationship advice, but\nshould she listen to them?\nThis is a story that travels from\nthe streets of London to the slopes of\nthe Alps and the shores of Thailand\n\u2013 and finds Bridget skydiving (or\nfalling), skiing (sort of) and finding\nherself in a few unfortunate cir-cumstances. Ms Jones flies from\nembarrassing situation to romantic\nmisunderstanding, still managing to\nmuddle through in this continuation\nof the trials and tribulations of the\nsingle working woman.\nIf you liked Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary,\nthree years was well worth the\nwait to see this next installment\nof Bridget\u2019s disaster-strewn adven-tures. Unlike many sequels, this ultimate chick flick managed to exceed\nour expectations and keep us captivated throughout.\nDespite using some of the same\ngags as the first film, we see Bridget\nand company extend the boundaries\nof their London base to explore places further afield, with new delights\nof Thai girls, boys and magic mush-rooms. The soundtrack is impressive and if Hugh Grant and Colin\nFirth are not enough, we also see\nan appearance of the lovely Paul\nNicholls!\nAgain, we see the cast work well\ntogether. Zellweger, having inflicted\nher body with an alarming weight\ngain for a second time, remasters\nboth a British accent and the skilful physical comedy that sees her\nnegotiate the Annual Law Dinner in\na skintight gold dress \u2013 not her most\nflattering moment!\nThose of you with the Y chromosome may have been dreading the\nrelease of this film, but if you are\ndragged along, you will be pleasantly surprised and we guarantee\nit will put a smile on your face!\nFor us fairer sex, this is the ultimate feel-good film and perfect for a\ngreat girls\u2019 night out. It is a comfort\nto all women, single and attached,\nthat even dating Mark Darcy has its\ndownfalls.\nThe light-hearted storyline had us\nin stitches from the opening scene\nof Bridget\u2019s sky-dive into pig excrement to the second round of Darcy\nvs Cleaver, which takes place in our\nvery own Hyde Park (if only we\u2019d\nbeen there).\nSarah Mayles and\nRakhi Sehmi\nGo Bridget go!\nSame Bridget, new diary\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 11 November 2004\n14\nBridget Jones: The Edge of\nReason\nDirector: Beeban Kidron\nStarring: Ren\u00e9e Zwellweger, Colin\nFirth, Hugh Grant\nLength: 108 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nReleased: Friday 12 November\nHHHHI\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe blind leading the blind\nBad Santa, good movie\nWillie (Billy Bob Thornton) has to\nbe the worst Santa Claus ever. He\nvomits on alley walls, swears at the\nchildren, pisses himself and comes\ninto work drunk.\nThe odd thing about this Santa\nClaus is his lack of Christmas spirit,\nand the fact that he\u2019s also a con-man, robbing each department\nstore on each Christmas Eve, with\na small dwarf (Tony Stark) as an\naccomplice. This strategy becomes\ncomplicated, however, when Willie\nmeets a bizarre eight-year-old child\n(Brett Kelly) who he exploits when\nhe needs a place to stay. As the days\ngo by, Willie seems to care more\nand more for The Kid, and The Kid\nteaches Willie the real meaning of\nChristmas.\nEvery character in this blackest\nof black comedies was funny, quirky\nand strange: three words that also\ndescribe the film. Bad Santa does\nits own thing and is one of a kind.\nEach performer took hold of their\nrole naturally and comfortably, with\nexception of The Kid, whose awkwardness was purposeful.\nWillie exudes bad behaviour and\nfoul language. He\u2019s a sad pathetic\nloser, and Billy Bob Thornton is\nexcellent in this role. He looks malnourished \u2013 the smallest, dirtiest\nSanta Claus ever seen. His hound\ndog looks emanate how unhappy\nhe is with life. Thornton shows yet\nanother example of his versatility\nin this film, along with his previous roles as Jacob Mitchell in A\nSimple Plan or Hank Grotowski in\nMonster\u2019s Ball.\nThe Kid is an oddball. Willie and\nThe Kid make the mildest connection at first, which grows slightly\nthroughout the film. It is unlike any\nother predictable \u201cbad man turns\ngood\u201d film in this way, because even\nthough Willie learns to care for The\nKid, he is still a rude, crude drunk\nand a bad man.\nNot one character in this film is an\naverage Joe or normal in any way,\nincluding the Jewish barmaid with a\nSanta fetish. This film has the most\nunusual and out of the ordinary plot,\nwhich gives it originality and is one\nreason above all to like the movie.\nThe Kid\u2019s incongruity is the key\nto producing comic value here.\nThat is why this movie will offend.\nMost of the jokes are targeted at the\nstrange, overly large child. In a way,\nit just doesn\u2019t seem right to laugh at\nit, or at Willie\u2019s pathetic existence.\nTony Cox steals the show though\nas the devilish vulgar midget, with\ncomical white elf ears.\nThe film is full of swearing, a small\namount of nudity, lots of suggestive\nsexual acts and violence. Beating up\na young boy is one of Willie\u2019s wildest\nmoments.\nThat said, I couldn\u2019t help but\nlaugh. This film was harsh but hilar-ious, the script was comedy.

    "content": "\u201cThey had a principle where\nMRSA patients were put on\nspecial wards, but they were\nall full. After she was readmit-ted, she deteriorated over the\nnext three days, and died of\nsepticemia.\u201d\nThe lamentation of a man\nwho lost his wife to the hospital superbug. Bereavements\nsuch as these have become\nunfortunately commonplace\nin the modern hospital envi-ronment. As the NHS is faced\nwith a crisis over this apparent epidemic, are hospitals\nand the government doing\nenough to help prevent the\nspread of the pathogen?\nThis week, about 15 people\nwill die as a direct result of\ninfection by MRSA, a deadly\nbacterium that has developed\nsubstantial resistance to\nmany of the different antibiotics used on hospital wards. In\ntotal, 800 people a year die of\nMRSA, and this only forms a\nfraction of the total number\nof deaths related to bacterial\ninfections contracted in hos-pitals. The title MRSA stands\nfor \u201cMythically Resistant\nStaphylococcus Aurous\u201d, and\nis a term used to describe\na variety of bacteria of the\nStaphylococcus Aurous family that have developed this\nform of resistance.\nThe bacteria are found\nin as much as 30% of the\npopulation, usually within the\nnasal passage or on the skin\nof carriers. They are usually\nharmless when carried in this\nway; infection occurs usually\nwhen the bacteria penetrate\nbeneath the skin, for example\nvia a wound. That explains\nwhy many of those who develop the symptoms of the infection are those who have had\nsome form of surgery. Once\ninside the body, the bacteria\ncan reproduce at a staggering\nrate, rapidly releasing toxins\nwhich can lead to devastating\nconditions such as blood poisoning and pneumonia.\nIn the past, the bacteria\nhave evolved their resistance\nto many of the antibiotics used\nin hospitals due to the high\nmutation rate of their genes\nand the misuse of said antibi-otics. Suppose that there are\n1000 Staphylococcus Aureas\nin a tissue. The antibiotic\nmethicillin may be used and\nit would kill 999 of them. Yet if\nthe course of antibiotics was\nabandoned early \u2013 as is often\nthe case due to the laziness of\nthe patient who fails to take\nhis prescription \u2013 the one\nthat survives may have developed resistance to the drug.\nThis development would be\ndue to the mutation of one\nor more of its genes, which\nwould, as if by accident, convey the necessary resistance.\nBacteria have evolved, how-ever, to have genes with high\nmutation frequencies in order\nto give them a competitive\nadvantage against immune\nsystems and, more recently,\nantibiotics. The one that is\nleft would reproduce rapidly,\nleading to a population of the\nbacteria that would carry\nresistance to the antibiotic.\nTherefore, and perhaps\nironically, it is due to the\ndevelopment of our own extra\ndefence mechanisms against\nthese bacteria that we have\nselectively cultured a family of pathogenic organisms\nwhich we are almost powerless to inhibit. Furthermore, it\nis in our hospitals that these\norganisms are at their most\nrampant. In an environment\nwhere there is a multitude\nof already weak and ill host\norganisms, ie patients, the\nbacteria can easily reproduce\nwith relative ease.\nIn addition to this, it appears\nthat many of our hospitals are\nmaking it even easier for this\norganism to exist, through\nsimple incompetence and the\nfailure to recognize the fullness of the threat posed by\nthese superbugs.\nIn a recent survey of five\nof London\u2019s most prominent\nhospitals, undertaken by an\nindependent scientist called\nDr Malyszewicz, appallingly\nunhygienic conditions have\nallowed the MRSA bacteria\nto propagate to dangerously\nhigh levels.\nThe levels of the bacteria\nwere measured using culture\ntechniques. Samples were\ntaken from various different\nareasofthehospital,forexam-ple work surfaces and hand-rails. These samples were\nthen incubated, allowing any\nbacteria present to grow into\ncolonies. The density of these\ncolonies was then measured.\nThe \u2018maximum safe level\u2019 of\nthe bacteria is 0.5 colonies\nper square centimetre. This\nlevel is considered as being\nthe threshold between safe\nand dangerously high levels\nof the bacteria.\nThe results were alarming.\nIn North Middlesex Hospital,\nEdmonton, and St Mary\u2019s\nHospital, Paddington, the\nlevel of the colonies was, at\nworst, 20 colonies per square\ncentimetre, 40 times higher\nthan the maximum safe level.\nDr Malyszewicz was scathing of all the hospitals he\nsurveyed, complaining about\nbasic hygiene and work surfaces that had not been properly washed in over 48 hours\nand, if they had been washed,\nthey had been washed with\ndetergents that had no effect\non the bacteria.\nAllthisaftertheGovernment\nhas poured \u00a31bn into the NHS\nspecifically to combat the\nspread of these killer bugs\nthrough our hospitals. Some\nsay that the Government\nis not doing enough, and,\nalthough I am inclined to\nagree with them, I would also\nsay that the Government cannot necessarily account for\nthe failure of its staff to wash\ntheir hands properly. That is\na problem which, I believe,\nmust be addressed at ward\nlevel. Better and safer policies must be introduced to\nmake sure that simple measures are undertaken with\ngreater enthusiasm.\nThere can be no complaint\nwith the levels of funding; it\nis up to hospital and ward\nmanagers to implement\nthese funds to better effect.\nThe hiring of more cleaners\nis one approach which I feel\nis fairly obvious. Furthermore\nI would argue that campaigns to staff that promote\nthe idea that extreme care\nmust be taken with respect\nto hygiene should be intro-duced. The simple things\n\u2013 washing hands and work-tops diligently and repeatedly\nevery day \u2013 could constitute a\nmajor weapon against these\norganisms.\nMany experts believe that\nMRSA and related bacteria\ncannot be wiped out. There\nwill always be a residual\npopulation in a hospital ward.\nIndeed, how can bacteria\nthat reside in the nasal passage of 30% of the population be completely overcome?\nYet this level can be a level\nwhereby the risk of infection\nis minimised. At the moment,\nit would appear that not\nenough is being done to limit\nthe levels of these bacteria in\nhospitals.\nAre we placing patients at\nfurther risk unnecessarily? I\nwonder if the families of the\n800 people killed each year by\nMRSA believe their bereavement was avoidable.\nNevertheless, it is still the\nultimate responsibility of the\nGovernment to initiate the\nmeasures that will reduce\nthe incidence of MRSA related deaths. The rise in the\nnumber of deaths from 51 in\n1993 to 800 in 2002 indicates\nthat, still, not enough is being\ndone. This number could\neven be substantially greater\nthan admitted, as it is not a\ndemand of doctors to fill in\nMRSA as a cause of death on\ndeath certificates.\nThe development of a vaccine is already well underway,\nand it is rapidly becoming a\ntangible prospect.

Bear that in mind\nnext time you fly.\nOf course, it would be an\nexaggeration to say that this\nincreases the cost of flying\nby a massive margin. In fact,\nit probably doesn\u2019t affect the\ncost of flying around Europe\nby much, at all. Which begs\nthe question, what am I talking about?\nIn truth, these stories are\ncompletely trivial compared\nto the coalition\u2019s (what a\nmisnomer that is) attack on\nFallujah, or, for instance, the\nongoing MRSA epidemic.\nReading Will Gates\u2019 article this week will leave you\nwith a sense of complete\ndisbelief. It is amazing how\noften the Government has\nnot done anything until it is\nfaced with crisis. This same\nthing happened with the BSE\nand foot-and-mouth crises.\nThe reason for this is that\nscientific advice is simply not\nbeing heeded. Governmental\npolicy is being moulded by\nthe fleeting force of public perception, so that the\nunderlying problems are\nallowed to develop until it is\ntoo late.\nThis week you can also\nread about a student who\nspent the summer studying\nabroad. As an Alumnus of the\nERASMUS scheme I would\nrecommend studying abroad\nto anyone. Ben King\u2019s article\nwill give you a good idea of\nwhat it\u2019s like.\n\n"

    "content": "Being confronted in a theatre by\nthree eccentric Americans may not\nbe your very British cup of tea, especially when they will presume to\ncram all 37 of William Shakespeare\u2019s\nworks into a mere 97 minutes. For\nthese three eccentric Americans, I\nsuggest you make an exception.\nThe Complete Works of William\nShakespeare \u2013 Abridged may sound\ndaunting, even if you have read,\nstudied or seen a fair proportion of\nhis works. One of the major achievements of the performance is to\npresent Shakespeare in an accessible manner. Provided, of course, you\ncan keep up.\nTo manage to fit all 37 of\nShakespeare\u2019s plays into such a\nshort production would appear dif-ficult, yet the performers are able\nto do it with some extensive editing,\nas well as expansive imaginations.\nFitting all 16 of the comedies into\none two minute sketch is a remarkable feat indeed. The idea promoted\nis that Shakespeare basically only\nhad four storylines \u2013 all of which\nhe plagiarised \u2013 allows this to be\nachieved.\nThe aim is, as ever, to make\nShakespeare understandable for a\nmodern audience. The decision to\nrap Othello, in spite of the fact that\nthe actors were, by their own admis-sion, \u201cracially challenged\u201d, is one\nattempt at this. Furthermore, the\nopening sketch, Romeo and Juliet,\nis one of the highlights of the pro-duction. A very masculine Juliet and\nvery camp Romeo frolic in a way that\nwould have made Shakespeare himself turn in his grave. Similarly, the\nMacbeth sketch is worth the ticket\nprice alone. 30 seconds (and that\u2019s\nit) of appalling Scottish accents and\neven worse costumes will have you\ncrying with laughter.\nYet, within the mirth and the laugh-ter, undertones emanate whereby\nthe true genius of Shakespeare is\nportrayed. The last 45 of the 97 minutes are devoted entirely to Hamlet,\ndescribed as probably \u201cthe greatest\nplay ever written in the English language\u201d; performed four times, once\nat some length, twice quicker and\nquicker and once backwards. The\naudience becomes involved in a way\nthat is simultaneously educational\nand amusing. To demonstrate the\ninner conflict being felt by Ophelia,\nthe audience is split into three, each\npart representing one of the id, the\nego and the alter-ego that make\nup her psyche. Beware not to sit in\nthe imaginatively titled Group C. I\nfound myself shouting \u201cCut the crap\nHamlet: my biological clock is ticking and I want babies now!\u201d when\ninstructed to do so.\nThe most incredible part of the\nperformance, though (with the\npossible exception of the Macbeth\nscene), came when one of the three\nrecited one of the famous lamentation speeches of Hamlet. Beginning\nquickly, the speaker gradually\nslowed down and dropped the volume of his voice as the power of the\nwords he was speaking began to\nbecome apparent, both to him and\nthe audience. When the recitation\nwas over, there was a silent awe.\nI cannot even remember how that\nsilence was broken.\nIt was unsurprising that US election opinions were incorporated into\nthe play, and these may well have\ndetracted slightly from the overall\nmomentum of the performance, otherwise it may be said that the fact\nthat there were only two references made them ease better into the\nShakespearean context. However,\nthe initial aim of the production, to\nperform all Shakespeare\u2019s plays in\n97 minutes, was achieved with such\nhilarity and subtle mysticism that\nlittle else that is derogatory can be\nsaid about it. A production that has\nintelligence beneath the mirth, The\nReduced Shakespeare Company is\none that really should be enjoyed\nby all.\nArts\nThe Criterion Theatre on Piccadilly \u2013 it\u2019s next to Lillywhites\n\u201cCut the crap Hamlet:\nmy biological clock\nis ticking and I want\nbabies now!\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 11 November 2004 13\nReduced Shakespeare\nCompany\nCriterion Theatre, W1\nLots of Shakespeare really fast\nTickets: \u00a310\u2013\u00a332\nThe bluffer\u2019s guide: Shakespeare\nCan Hamlet truly be done backwards?

The firsts saw this as a\nwake-up call, and Oli Wright\nslotted home the winner to\ntake three points and second\nspot in the table.\nThe first half was a physical affair, with Wright and\nBenji Marcos-Walker having\nto work hard against some\nstrong Kent defenders. At the\nother end, Kent were finding\nit difficult to penetrate the\nback line of Woodcock, Farr,\nMills and Gray, and when\nthey did, \u2018keeper Vasquez was\non top form in between the\nsticks. Imperial battled well\nand earned the right to play\nwith McMahon and Berks\nlooking tenacious in the centre of midfield.\nMidway through the half,\nKent\u2019s \u2018keeper pushed a low\nshot from Marcos-Walker\naround the post. Woodcock\ndelivered the resulting corner and McMahon rose highest in a crowded box to head\nthe firsts in front.\nMinutes later, MarcosWalker found Wright with a\nsuperb pass, but the captain\nfired wide. The pressure was\nbuilding and Kent were glad\nto hear the half time whistle\nblow.\nImperial started the second half brightly; a couple\nof attacks nearly conjured\nup goals straight after the\nrestart. They were playing\nentertaining football and got\nthe ball out wide much more\nthan in previous weeks. Gray\nand Ward were combining\ndown the right with Sugito\nand Woodcock looking dangerous on the left.\nIt could have been 2-0 when\na far post cross from the\nleft was headed back across\ngoal by McMahon, but Kent\u2019s\n\u2018keeper managed to get to it\nfirst.\nAlthough Imperial came\nclose, it was Kent who found\nthe back of the net. After a\nrare spell of Kent possession,\na cross came in from the left\nand the striker got to it first to\nhead home the equaliser.\nKent noticeably grew in\nconfidence after equalising,\nbut Imperial worked hard\nto get back on top. Vasquez\nwas playing brilliantly in\nthe Imperial goal, fighting\nbravely to claim a dangerous\nlooking Kent corner from the\nleft. Imperial thought their\nchance to regain the lead\nhad come when Wright was\nscythed down in the box, but\nappeals for a penalty were\ndenied for the third time this\nseason.\nWright, perhaps looking to\njustify his massive fantasy\nfootball price tag, took advantage of a poor Kent throw-in\ndeep in their half. He dispossessed the defender and slotted the ball past the \u2018keeper\nfrom a tight angle. An exuberant celebration followed, but\nthe game was not yet won.\nSubstitutes Greedy and\nTorossian were then brought\nin and worked hard during\nthe final moments of the\ngame, but neither side could\ncreate a clear cut chance.\nThe final whistle blew and\nImperial took all three points,\nlifting them to second in the\ntable.\nThis solid, convincing\nperformance showed that\nImperial are real title contenders in the tough BUSA\nleague.\nImperial firsts too strong for Kent\nFOOTBALL\nSponsored by\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 10\nBuckinghamshire\nChilterns Men\u2019s 1st 18\nBy Mike Hicks\nHaving not lost so far this\nseason, the ICURFC First XV\nwere confident of another vic-tory. Sadly, Bucks Chilterns\nwere in the same position!\nThe game started with\nsome strong pressure from\nthe Bucks pack in our 22, and\nwe knew we were in for a\nhard fought forwards battle.\nTo add to this, whenever we\ncleared the ball up field, a\ngood opposition back three\nsent it straight back!\nThis lead to Bucks spending most of the first half\ninside our half, but the strong\nImperial defence conceded\njust six points via penalties.\nAt half time we knew we\nhad to raise our game and\nplay to our strengths, not\ntheirs. Some good pressure\nlead to Bucks conceding a\npenalty on their 22, making\nit 6-3. Unfortunately, as we\nstarted to gain momentum, a\nclearance kick on our 5m line\nwas charged down and Bucks\nscored under the posts, giving them a 13-3 lead.\nThe Bucks captain was sent\nfor ten minutes off the field for\ninterfering with the ball in the\nruck, which had been happening all game. Unfortunately,\nwe couldn\u2019t capitalise on\nthis advantage. The frustration began to boil over in the\nImperial ranks, culminating\nin Higgins being shown a\nstraight red for stamping and\nfacing a lengthy ban.\nDown to 14 men, we battled on with the game still\nwithin our grasp. Good pressure lead to Bucks conceding\na penalty, and a good kick put\nus on the opposition 5m line.\nFrom the lineout, a classic\ndrive on the second jumper\nlead to captain Hicks going\nover for a try. This was converted by Spencer, and suddenly at 13-10 we were right\nback in it.\nHowever, some mis-com-munication at a maul near\nour line lead to several opposition forwards breaking off.\nWhile the entire Imperial\npack defended against the\nplayers without the ball, the\nones with it ran over for a try,\nmaking it 18-10.\nWith the game now all but\nover, another yellow card was\nshown and Aung was sent to\nthe sin bin for some unnecessary footwork in a ruck.\nNext week we face Reading,\nknowing that victory is a must\nto stay in contention for pro-motion.\nRugby boys\u2019\nfirst loss\nRUGBY\nA \u2018Herty\u2019 victory\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nHertfordshire Men\u2019s 3rd 2\nBy John Scott\nMany years ago, in a land far\naway, a wise man said: \u201ca win\nis a win, a draw is a draw, just\ndon\u2019t lose\u201d. This man subsequently died \u2013 people got pissed off with him stating the\nobvious and killed him.\nIt was with this tragic death\nimprinted on our young minds\nthat we rode the \u2018Venga Bus\u2019\nout to Hatfield, to do battle\nwith the evil Hertfordshire\nThirds. Our fellowship was\nslightly weakened by the loss\nof key players, such as Dom\n\u2018The Idiotic\u2019, a hardy dwarf\nfrom the land of the North,\nJan \u2018The Fullback\u2019 and Adam\n\u2018The Facial Hair\u2019.\nHowever, our intrepid\nleader Shatters filled the gaping chasm by calling up Ben\nfrom the fifths and tinkering\nwith the formation.\nThe match began with a\nminute\u2019s half-silence for the\naforementioned murdered\nman.\nThe game started in a blustering fashion. Each side\ntraded insults until suddenly\nImperial Thirds took a dramatic lead. Matty Orford\nunleashed a trademark \u2018big\nkick\u2019 from the back. Leon,\nwho all game was at his twinkling best, allowed the ball\nto drop over his head and\nthen nonchalantly volleyed it\nin to \u2018the Scott\u2019 who turned\non a sixpence and released\nLeon down the right. Leon\nhit the byline and cut back\nthe cheekiest of cheeky cut-backs, which was dummied\nby the effervescent Perry\nbefore being dispatched into\nthe far corner by a jubilant\nScott.\nThe lead was short-lived\n\u2013 our normally rock solid\nrear was unceremoniously\nbreached by an insertion\nagainst the run of play. In\nshort, the little lad who liked\nto ping it from the edge of the\nbox caught one well and it\neluded Matty and went in.\nThe defence were riled\n\u2013 unused to being scored\nagainst, they proceeded to\nplay the games of their young\nlives. Shat-Ruso in the centre\nsolidly repelled wave after\nwave of attack. Displaying a\nsymbiosis that would make\ncommensal bacteria blush\nwith envy, Timmy and Tom\nat fullback were like angry\nbeasts, letting nothing past\nand providing a good platform for forays forward.\nPerry, ever the architect\nof mayhem, led his marker\na merry dance on a looping\ndummy run. The ball broke\nkindly to Scott on the edge\nof the box, who turned like\na roundabout and sent an\nunstoppable pea-roller past\nthe floundering keeper. Twoone, game on.\nAfter the restart, service\nresumed as normal, and John\nand Has picked up where\nthey had left off, harrying and\nplaying peachy killer balls.\nAnother \u2018big kick\u2019 by Matty\nwas charged on by Has, unafraid of competing with the\nkeeper and the two lumbering centre halves. Scott hung\nback slightly, then stuck a\ntoe into the m\u00e9l\u00e9e, connected\nwith the ball and crisply finished it.\nAt three-one up against the\nleaders of our BUSA group,\nI don\u2019t think that we could\nbe reproached for becoming\na little complacent. So much\nso, in fact, that Shatters\ndecided to ring the changes.\nHe thought that we should\nall go to the bar and leave\nrudimentary scarecrows in\nour places to see whether\nthey could hold on to the lead.\nWe said that this was mad-ness, so he decided to swap\nBen with Perry and leave him\nwith ten scarecrow team-mates.\nThe plan was a bold one and\nit nearly worked perfectly.\nHertfordshire couldn\u2019t work\nout how to get past Ben and\nthe scarecrows. They scored\nonce in the dying minutes,\na goal which I\u2019m told Matty\nscarecrow could have done\nbetter with, however Ben did\na good job. So it ended a very\nrespectable three-two to the\nImperial. Well done chaps,\nlet\u2019s keep it going.\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nGoldsmiths Men\u2019s 1st 2\nBy Michael Nicholson\nTheoretically this was the\ntoughest game of the season so far for the Fourths.\nGoldsmiths are always a\nstrong unit, and approached\nthis game with added confidence after triumphing in the\nCup last season.\nIt was, however, Imperial\nwho started the match with\ngreater vigour, with excellent\npassing, movement and overall effort. Opportunities were\nbeing carved out from all\nareas of the pitch, but special\ncredit goes to Demetris and\nTony who caused all sorts of\nproblems down the right. An\nImperial goal seemed immi-nent, but Goldsmiths\u2019 experienced \u2018keeper had an excellent game, controlling his box\nwell and making saves when\nneeded.\nGoldsmiths began to take\nhold of the midfield, and\nclawed themselves back\ninto the match. A sustained\nperiod of pressure saw them\nwin a corner on the right,\nand despite clearing the initial cross, some neat passing\nfrom Goldsmiths saw their\nstriker break clear and tuck\na neat finish past Vanni.\nImperial refused to buckle\nand pressed on, but the\nGoldsmiths\u2019 \u2018keeper\u2019s ominous good form kept the half\ntime score one-nil.\nThe second half was still\nyoung when Imperial forced a\ncorner on the right. Demetris\nproduced a perfect cross,\nwhich was headed home like\na bullet by Shwin continuing\nhis excellent goal-scoring\nform. It got worse for shell-shocked Goldsmiths when\nDave \u2018the Hippy\u2019 looped a\n\u2018flower powered\u2019 shot from 25\nyards out. The \u2018keeper was\nfooled, thinking it would go\nwell over the bar, but it looped\nneatly over his head into the\nnet, giving \u2018the Hippy\u2019 his first\never strike in an Imperial jersey and giving the Fourths\nthe lead.\nHowever, the game ended\nin a typical Fourth team\nfashion, with the opposition\nbeing gifted a scrappy goal.\nA cross from the right wasn\u2019t\ndealt with properly and their\nspeedy midfielder, somehow\nfree in the middle of the box,\nkneed the ball past Vanni.\nUnlike previous games,\nImperial were spurred on\nand really should have taken\nall three points. But Jai and\nShwin both spurned decent\nchances and the Goldsmiths\n\u2018keeper made two absolutely\nblinding saves from Chris\nParrot, excelling yet again on\nthe left.\nThe final whistle denied\nthe Fourths the win they\ndeserved. It was, however, a\nperformance they could be\nproud of.\nThe Imperial Thirds, before being replaced by scarecrows\nat the end of the match\n\n"

The next four\nyears of Bush\u2019s presidency\nwill effectively determine the\nstate of the world\u2019s economy,\nbut whether that is a good\nthing or not is anybody\u2019s\nguess.\nThe delighted\nUS citizens wait in anticipation for the first of Bush\u2019s new\ninitiatives in his second term.\nHis much-publicised plan to\noverhaul the Social Security\nsystem started on Monday,\nstarting with the drawing of\nnew proposals brought about\nby conclusions from the\nbipartisan commission. Also,\nBush has suggested that he\nwill stay personally involved\nto ensure completion of\nthis legislative package.\nUnder his payroll-to-stock\nplan, a certain percentage of\npayroll tax, currently 12.4%,\nwill be devoted to private\naccounts, from which employees can invest in stocks and\nbonds.\nInvestors in major indices worldwide grew a smirk\nas the S&P 500, an overall\nmeasure of the stock market,\ngained over 1% after Bush\u2019s\nvictory, along with increases\nof the Dow Jones to 10,314\nand the FTSE 100 to a two\nyear high of 4,718. Also, the\nmetal industry rose across\nthe board despite China\u2019s\nrecent increase in interest\nrates, in an attempt to curb\ninflation rates, of which metal\nexports were a major con-tributor.\nJohn Kerry\u2019s concession\ndefinitely helped the market\nmove decisively, and the equity markets were no excep-tion. A Kerry victory would\nbe deemed negative because\nof his desire to reverse tax\ncuts and introduce policies\nthat are viewed as unfavourable for pharmaceutical and\nenvironmentally sensitive\nsectors.\nGeorge W Bush must\nbe absolutely chuffed. He\nendured, very remarkably,\nthe 11 September attacks,\nmajor accounting scandals\nand a global recession. His\nadministration actually did\nreally well to keep the US\neconomy afloat. In addition\nit has to be admitted that,\nrelative to the attacks of 11\nSeptember, no significant terrorist activities have taken\nplace; rather it is Bush\u2019s\nattacks that have come under\nscrutiny.\nThe pharmaceutical industry breathed a sigh of relief\nas they lay beyond the reach\nof Kerry, the failed presidential candidate seen as more\nhostile towards this industry\nbecause of his intention to cut\nmedicine prices.\nThe dismayed\nFamilies of dead soldiers in\nIraq have expressed their\ndisgust at Bush\u2019s re-elec-tion, calling it \u201cunworthy\u201d\nand \u201cstunning\u201d. From the\ntime Bush\u2019s \u2018war on terror\u2019\nbegan after the attacks of\nSeptember 11 and before the\nofficial handover in June this\nyear, almost 9000 troops have\ndied or been fatally wounded\n(from both enemy and coalition fire).\nThe series of blunders at the\nbeginning of the war, including the shooting down of a\ncoalition apache helicopter\nand ground troops, clearly\njustifies Bush\u2019s re-election as\ntruly stunning.\nThe financial cost, however,\nis mind boggling. Despite the\nUS\u2019s $10 trillion economy,\nthe $150bn spent is beyond\ncomprehension and another\nfactor that seems to have\npassed beyond the American\npeople in their voting strategy last Friday, although it\u2019s\ncomforting to hear that Bush\nwas spending conservatively\nwhen he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use\nof sending a $2 million missile\ninto a $10 tent to hit a camel\nin the butt?\u201d\nAlthough the equity markets and world indices\nrejoiced at Bush\u2019s victory,\nthe dollar made a record fall\nagainst the euro despite the\nUS economy showing healthy\nsigns: among them, a 37,000\nincrease in employment in\nOctober and an alleviated\nUS deficit accumulation.\nBush persisted in conveying\nhis plans to truncate the US\ntrade and industry deficit of\n$410bn by instigating budget\ncuts and relying heavily on\neconomy growth. He claimed\nthat tax reform or any other\nconsumer-affecting means\nwould not be undertaken, to\na significant amount at least,\nto bring the nation out from\nthe red. Also, the increase in\nemployment is only a temporary hike that Bush no doubt\ncreated to add to his positive contribution to the US\neconomy. The fact is that over\n821,000 jobs have been lost\nsince Bush took the reins four\nyears ago.\nWhen nine Nobel prize winners in economics concur that\nthe Bush administration went\n\u201con a reckless and extreme\ncourse that endangers the\nlong-term economic health\nof our nation\u201d, some serious\nthinking needs to be done on\nthe outcome of this election.\nThe nine campaigners for\nKerry cited \u201cpoorly designed\u201d\ntax cuts that instead of creating jobs had transformed the\nbudget surpluses left by Bill\nClinton into enormous defi-cits, adding that this \u201cfiscal\nirresponsibility threatens the\nlong-term economic security\nand prosperity of our nation\u201d.\nAmong those involved in this\nstatement were Kenneth\nArrow and William Sharpe\nof Stanford University, Paul\nSamuelson of MIT and Daniel\nKahneman of Princeton.\nAnd the furious\nI\u2019m confident that millions will\njoin me as I show my disgust\nat the outcome of the elec-tions. How could the majority\nof US citizens vote for someone who clearly can\u2019t make\nhis own decisions, stumbles\nat everything unexpected,\nbe it rocks on the ground or\nquestions from the press, and\nis absolutely out of touch with\nthe world economy. As Bush\nheads for the presidential\nretreat this weekend at Camp\nDavid, I might just make my\nown retreat into the US Yahoo\ngroups to delve into the typical American mind.

    "content": "By Nichola Hawkins\nWye Correspondent\nLast week saw Wye\u2019s annual\nCharity Week, a week of madness all in the name of Charity,\nin a similar spirit to Imperial\u2019s\nRAG Week but with our own\ndistinctive traditions.\nSunday night was the\nHalloween Launch Party,\nand also saw the release of\nthe RAG Mag, featuring silly\nquotes, pathetic chat-up lines\nand such coveted awards as\n\u2018Most Alcoholic Fresher\u2019.\nThe drinking clubs\u2019 costumes\nfor the week were revealed\ntoo, with Robin Hood Beaus,\nCheerleader Garters and\nThunderbirds JSF.\nMonday night was an\nInternational Culture Night,\nhosted by the Overseas\nStudents Organisation, and\nsaw the Union packed out\nwith home and overseas students alike.\nHowever, Tuesday morning\nsaw a most definite return\nto Wye\u2019s traditional RAG cal-endar, with the Champagne\nBreakfast. This year, when\nstudents gathered in full black\ntie dress, it turned out that the\ncoaches were taking them to\nPlanet Laser in Canterbury,\nwhere they found out the hard\nway what two laser games,\ninterspersed with two bottles\nof fizzy wine each, and fry-up sandwiches thrown in, can\ndo to the digestion. However,\nthis did not deter them from\nsupporting at least two of the\nvillage pubs in between their\nreturn and the opening of the\nUnion bar that evening for DJ\nBenjy\u2019s \u2018Shake Down\u2019 urban\nmusic night.\nWednesday was scheduled\nas the Druids\u2019 Disco, but a\nproblem with their intended venue meant this had to\nbe cancelled at less than a\nday\u2019s notice. However, their\nrival clubs were keen to step\nin, and by 7.30 that evening\nthe JSF had organised a\nScavenger Hunt, which somehow (miraculously) seems to\nhave stayed on the right side\nof the law, with such categories as \u2018a barmaid\u2019s phone\nnumber\u2019, \u2018a receipt for Baileys\nand Lime\u2019, \u201csomething green\nand gold\u2019 and \u2018another team\u2019s\nunderwear\u2019.\nEmbarrassingly, the JSF\nteam themselves came joint\nlast with the Garters (amidst\nmany accusations of score-fixing), and even more embarrassingly (but also more pre-dictably) lost the tie-breaker\nyard-downing race. However,\ntheir careful planning did\nresult in many items being\n\u2018borrowed\u2019 ready for the next\nday\u2019s auction.\nThursday night was the customary Slave Auction. In fact,\nthe slaves only constituted\nthe last four lots (four pairs\nof freshers, two male and\ntwo female); the rest of the\nlots were items of students\u2019\nproperty \u2018borrowed\u2019 at various points, including favourite clothing, computer disks,\ncar keys, number plates... in\nshort, anything that had not\nbeen nailed down that week,\nand a few things that had\nbeen.\nFriday was the Charity\nWeek Ball, with a James Bond\ntheme. The Union bar and\ndancefloor were draped in\nblack and white and decorated with a multitude of sparkly\nthings; the Agents wore their\ntuxes, the Bond Girls wore\ntheir cocktail dresses, the Old\nBoys were back in force and\nthe drinks were flowing.\nThis would usually mark the\nend of the week. However, due\nto the way the dates worked\nout this year, the Bonfire Party\nthat usually opens the week\non the first Saturday was held\non the final Saturday instead.\nThe traditional torchlight procession up to the crown was\nas large as any recent year,\nwith torches, food and glow\nsticks all selling out more rapidly than anyone could have\npredicted.\nFollowing an impressive\nfireworks display, the students (old and new) returned\nto the Union bar for one last\nchance to drink in the name\nof Charity, and to count up\ntheir takings for the week.\nThe final count has yet to be\ncompleted, but the figure so\nfar stands at just over \u00a31050\nand so, considering our student body numbers just a few\nhundred, the gauntlet has\nmost definitely been thrown\ndown for the rest of Imperial\u2019s\nRAG efforts.\nWye Charity Week raises \u00a31000\nWho\u2019s behind the mask? A Wye student enjoying the Charity Week Ball\nAround Campus felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Andy Brown\nSilwood Park correspondent\nOne of the advantages of living in the middle of nowhere\nis the ability to have parties\nlike this with (relative to the\nother city campuses) few\nhealth and safety concerns.\nThe carefully chosen site\nfor the bonfire, Silwood bot-tom, has very little to set fire\nto, with the exception of our\nhumungous bonfire and of\ncourse the traditional guy.\nAn annual event out here,\nthere is nothing quite like it\n(except maybe Lewes). No\nfireworks unfortunately, but\nwith open grounds in true\nstudent style we are able\nto watch the big explosions\naround us. The groundsmen\nhere collect fuel for the fire all\nweek, and traditionally first\nyear PhD students spend\nFriday building it.\nThen, with a pint in hand,\nmales are drawn from all over\nthe site to the prospect of fire\nlike wasps to beer. Like the\nprimitive Neanderthal man,\nthey then stand around grunt-ing, wondering how to get\nthis extravaganza underway.\nUnwilling to siphon petrol off\na nearby unclaimed car, they\nresort to toilet roll and blow-ing. It is rather amusing to\nwatch a group of eight male\nHomo habilis trying to start\na twelve foot high bonfire by\nblowing on it.\nDue to the wet summer and\nrecent weather experienced,\nit didn\u2019t go up as quickly as\nexpected, prolonging the\nenjoyment that is watching\nfire, an unexplainable phe-nomenon. Maybe it\u2019s the element of danger or the respect\nwe have for it. Like the primate cave people, it means a\nhuge advancement in civilisation \u2013 no more raw Silwood\ndeer, we can spit roast them\nnow!\nThree hours after starting,\nthe feast began with roasting chestnuts. It was made\nclear that they were collected\nlocally and the Union held\nno responsibility for illness\nincurred or bugs found with-in. Groups of hunter gatherer\nHomo erectus spread out in\nsearch of some way of cooking them on the now burning\ninferno, returning later with\na borrowed shovel (resource\nreallocation is a transferable\nskill that my PhD has taught\nme well). A little hard to start\nwith, they got better as the\nnight proceeded... or was it\nthe increase in blood alcohol\nlevel? Kindly provided black\npeas (a northern delicacy,\napparently) with salt and vinegar as well as treacle toffee\nconcluded the balanced diet\nof the night.\nFrustrated at not having\nour own fireworks, a cunning\nidea was forged to throw piles\nof leaves on the fire sending\nred hot ashes high into the\ncloudless country sky. Who\nneeds roman candles when\nyou have these for free?\nThe evolution of man was\ncompleted with a survivors\u2019\nbreakfast and the promise of\nbacon and eggs. Arguably one\nof Homo sapiens\u2019 greatest\nadvancements is agriculture,\nthe concentrated growing and\nbreeding of food. This was put\nto good use with the break-fast, and with it, the evolution\nof mankind was completed in\none night.\nBurn baby burn, Silwood inferno\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 11 November 2004 7\n\n"
