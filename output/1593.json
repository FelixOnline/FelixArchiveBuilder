    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 22\nFELIX 16.01.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA Tale of Two Halves from the RSC\nFred Fyles & Kamil McClelland take turns reviewing the\nBarbican Centre\u2019s production of Henry IV\nThe Royal Shakespeare\nCompany has shown once\nagain that it defines how\nShakespeare should be performed.\nUnusually at the Barbican as\nopposed to the Globe, the restraints\nof performing in the round were\nremoved, opening up more options\nfor staging and props. This allowed\na realistic scene to be set, engrossing\nyou more fully in this world of\ndebauchery and rebellion.\nI don\u2019t usually find Shakespeare\nhistory plays all that exciting.\nAlthough just as excellent as his other\npieces, they sometimes feel bound in\ntheir creativity by the need for at least\nsome historical accuracy. And despite\nthis somewhat being the case here\nlater on, the performance showed that\nit needn\u2019t be so; not for a second did I\nfeel bored in this gripping portrayal\nof the king\u2019s troubled life.\nThe play tells the story of newly\ncrowned Henry IV and the many\nissues he faces, both personal and\npolitical. From the north comes\nopposition from the previous king\u2019s\nelected heir, Edmund Mortimer,\nas well as from impulsive Harry\n\u2018Hotspur\u2019 Percy. On top of this, the\nking must deal with his depraved son\nPrince Hal and his band of miscreant\nfriends from the taverns of Eastcheap.\nAs opposition bubbles over into open\nrebellion, the king must try to reunite\nhis fractured country as well as his\nfractured lineage.\nWhat makes Shakespeare plays so\ngenius is of course the playwright\u2019s\nphenomenal command of the\nEnglish language. This was perfectly\naccentuated here by stellar acting\nperformances, especially from\nlovingly and poetically inebriated Sir\nJohn Falstaff (Antony Sher). However,\nduring battle scenes towards the\nend of the play, it unfortunately\nfelt as if the dialogue took more of\na back seat in place of too great an\nemphasis on dramatic stage fighting.\nAdmittedly not entirely the fault\nof the production, the beauty of the\nlanguage felt overpowered by clich\u00e9d\nsound effects of clashing swords\nand roaring armies. Scenes like this\nmay have been better at the Globe,\nstripped back with a greater purity,\nwhere you cannot hide behind cheap\nsound effects and the lyrical mastery\nhas space to soar.\nThus, I felt the production was\ngenerally extremely good, as one\ncan always ensure with the Royal\nShakespeare Company and their\nexcellent troupe of actors. However,\nwhilst the new setting had its\nupsides, some of the simple beauty\nof the Globe was muddled amongst\ndistracting additions.\nSadly, the exciting first half gives\nway to a much less nuanced\nproduction of Henry IV Part\nII. The set-up is largely where we\nleft off from Part I; after crushing\none rebellion, King Henry IV must\nfend off a second one, led by the\nArchbishop of York, whilst also\nfighting illness. Prince Hal has\n\u2013 much to his father\u2019s chagrin \u2013\nresumed his philandering with the\naging Falstaff. Beyond this there are a\ncouple of subplots, although they take\nup far more time than is necessary,\nmeaning that the political intrigue of\nthe first half is more or less removed.\nInstead, we have an increase in bawdy\nhumour, painted in much broader\nstrokes by Antony Sher, and while I\nunderstand that Shakespeare can be\ndifficult to understand at the best of\ntimes, gurning to the audience and\nbreaking the fourth wall does not a\nwitty comedy make.\nWe do have a number of standout performances in this half, none\nmore compelling than that of Paola\nDionisotti, who plays the Eastcheap\ntavern owner Mistress Quickly with\nverve and aplomb; stalking the stage\nlike a sinewy version of Eastenders\u2019\nPeggy Mitchell, her impressive\nperformance has all of us completely\ncaptivated.\nUltimately, this move towards\na more mainstream comedy does\nthe play a disservice in two ways:\nfirst of all, the scenes are simply\nless interesting. Rather than being a\npolitical drama, in which Falstaff is\nincluded as light relief for those who\ncan\u2019t tell their earls from their dukes,\nthe second half quite simply becomes\n\u2018The Falstaff Show\u2019, which \u2013 although\ngiving Sher a chance to show off his\nobviously considerable acting talent \u2013\ndoes very little to drive the plot along;\nwe lurch from one Falstaff scene to\nanother, as the drama is consigned to\nthe background.\nIt also means that when drama\ndoes occur it simply feels out of place.\nIt\u2019s all fun and games with Falstaff,\nand then suddenly we are reminded\nthat there is a bloody war going on,\ndragging us into the action abruptly.\nThe ending of the play is particularly\ndisappointing; Prince Hal, taking\nadvice from his father and the Chief\nJustice, spurns Falstaff\u2019s advances,\nbarking at him \u2018I know thee not, old\nman\u2019. This is supposed to be a crucial\nmoment of the play, a spine-chilling\nreminder of the death of innocence,\nand the fickle nature of human\nkindness. The preceding action means\nthat the line has very little impact; it\nis tossed aside, like a piece of garbage;\nit deserved better.\nHenry IV is certainly a difficult\nplay to put on. The balance between\ncomedy and drama is a fine line, that\nis \u2013 as we saw tonight \u2013 easy to cross.\nWhile most of the performances were\nwonderful, the experience had a weird\ndisjointed feel, when it should have\nflowed like sack from Falstaff\u2019s cup\n(but then again, maybe after 5 hours\nof theatre anyone would begin to\nfeel the strain). It is also unfortunate\nthat Barbican are putting on the\nplay so shortly after Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s\ncritically-acclaimed, radically\nreinterpreted version of Henry IV\nwas on at the Donmar Warehouse\nand inevitably comparisons will be\nmade. If you\u2019re a bit of a perfectionist,\nwho insists on seeing things in\ntheir entirety, then go along to both\nparts; just bear in mind that \u2013 like\nthe warring factions of Middle Age\nEngland \u2013 the road to unity can be a\nbloody one.\nHenry IV Part I, 2014, Antony Sher and Alex Hassell Photo: Kwame\nLestrade\nJoshua Richards, Antony Sher and Youssef Kerkour in Henry lV Parts l\nand ll Photo: Tristram Kenton\nHenry IV, Part I\nreviewed by Kamil McClelland\nHenry IV, Part II\nreviewed by Fred Fyles\nEditorial: Looking\nForward, Looking\nBack\nThe new year brings with it an\nopportunity for new beginnings:\na chance to plan for the future,to\nmake new goals,to set out on a path\ninto a brighter tomorrow.But it\u2019s\nalso a chance to reflect,to look back\non what has happened over the last\nyear.This process,of looking back\nand looking forward,is central to\nthe world of art,and the progression\nof creativity.\nGeorge Santayana said that\u201cthose\nwhocan\u2019trememberthepastare\ncondemnedtorepeatit\u201d.This may be\ntrue for the vast majority of cases,\nbut in art those who know the past\nare able to learn,be inspired by,and\nindeed repeat it.\nWith that in mind,we spend our\nfirst issue of the year looking\nforward to the coming months,and\ntaking a trip back through artistic\nhistory.We start with a review of\none of Shakespeare\u2019s histories,Henry\nIV,which reinterpreted,and was\nbased on the story of the 15th\ncentury\nking of England.Given that there\nare two parts,and two arts editors,\nwe decided to tackle a section each,\ngiving our differing opinions on\neach.\nThis year sees a very special\nanniversary,which seems to have\nbeen overlooked by all but the\nWhitechapel Gallery; they celebrate\nthe centenary of Malevich\u2019s Black\nSquare,a work that ushered in an\nera of abstract modernism,and\nchanged the artistic world forever.\nWe let them take us on a journey\nthrough the past century,seeing\nhow the square has touched all our\nlives in a myriad of ways.\nA large part of the world of theatre\nis looking forward,trying to predict\nwhat is going to be the next big\nproduction,or the next Meryl Streep.\nWith that in mind,we\u2019ve sent Max\nFalkenberg around London to try\nand discover the best and brightest\nin small theatres.These are plays\nthat may have slipped through the\nnet,not having the same publicity\nas other,larger productions.As we\nsee from his reviews,there may be a\nreason that this is the case...\nWe then finish this week\u2019s section\nwith a term preview of arts,letting\nyou know what the hot tickets\nare going to be in the world of art,\ntheatre,dance,and opera.With such\na large range of options on offer in\nthe capital,it can be confusing to\nknow exactly what to go for; luckily\nwe can give you a little nudge,\nletting you know what is coming\nup over the next couple of months.\nOnwards and upwards.\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\n\n"

    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n16.01.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFreedom of speech in a civilised society\nLast week\u2019s heinous attacks\non Charlie Hebdo caused\nan outpouring of grief and\nsupport from around the world\nfor the innocents who lost their\nlives that day, and in the days that\nfollowed. The brazen assault was led\nby two masked gunmen claiming\nthat they were avenging the name\nof the Prophet Muhammad, whose\ngross caricatures Charlie Hebdo had\npublished in years gone by. And yet,\n2 of the 12 murder victims that day\nwere Muslim \u2013 one named Ahmed,\nthe other Mustapha \u2013 both names of\nthe Prophet Muhammad, a telling\nsymbol of the character assassination\nthat took place that day. In the\ncoverage that followed, it became\nclear that the terrorists did more to\ndefame the name of Islam than any\ncartoon ever could.\nIt should be absolutely clear that\nthese attacks were the antithesis\nof Islam\u2019s peaceful teachings. The\nQur\u2019an does not allow any act of\nterrorism, likening the murder of\na single innocent to the murder of\nthe whole of mankind (5:32). One\nwonders then, how many Earths these\nterrorists would fill with blood. At\nthis point, critics often join hands\nwith extremists in misquoting verses\nregulating rules of warfare, whilst\nhiding the proviso that such warfare\nis explicitly only permitted in defence\nof innocents who have been attacked\nfirst (22:39), who have undergone\nsevere persecution and whose\nlegitimate rights have been ransacked\n(2:191-193). Freedom of conscience\ntoo is enshrined as a fundamental\nhuman right in Islam: \u201cThere is no\ncompulsion in matters of religion,\u201d it\nsays, effectively rebutting the totality\nof extremist ideology in just a few\nwords (2:256).\nWith this said, the attacks have\nreignited the debate over how\ncivilised society should practice\nfreedom of speech. From the vile\nfilm released a few years ago, to\nthe cartoons published by several\nEuropean outlets, caricatures made\nof the Prophet Muhammad have\nrepeatedly hurt the sentiments of\n1.6 billion Muslims the world over.\nIn the wake of last week\u2019s attacks,\nwestern media has wisely refrained\nfrom re-publishing any of the\nconcerned cartoons, but there is a\nstrong sense that this was more out\nof self-protection than responsible\nediting. \u201cPublish and be damned\u201d\nwas the Independent editor\u2019s initial\nreaction, only tempered, he said, by\na duty towards his staff. Worryingly\nfor Muslims, two thirds of the\nBritish public would also support\ntheir publication, as a YouGov poll\nrevealed last weekend.\nThis kind of reactionary abandon\nis understandable, but misplaced.\nFree speech itself is a means by which\nsociety can exchange productive\nideas and become better informed\nas a whole. However, when such an\nexchange threatens social peace and\nunnecessarily vilifies parts of the\npopulation, it is always curtailed. For\ninstance, the French Catholic Church\nsuccessfully blocked an \u2018offensive\u2019\nadvert depicting the Last Supper in\n2005. Charlie Hebdo themselves fired\none of their cartoonists in 2008 for an\nanti-Semitic article and cartoon. In\ngeneral, western society acknowledges\nthat gratuitous insulting, which\nserves no other purpose but to\nincite hatred and divide society,\nshould be censored. The art of satire\nlies in the weak highlighting the\ninconsistencies of the powerful.\nCaricaturing the beloved hero of\nthe already beleaguered French\nMuslim population, whose women\ncannot even wear headscarves whilst\nemployed in public service, is a gross\ncaricature of satire itself.\nThis does not mean to say that\nMuslims hold Islam to be somehow\nabove criticism and debate. Muslims\ndo not seek preferential treatment,\nbut equal treatment to other\npopulations whose sentiments are\nroutinely safeguarded. Horrendous\nthough the attacks were, the British\npublic mustn\u2019t let them knock askew\ntheir usual poise on issues like these.\nFor the time being, as a Muslim, I\ntake the Prophet Muhammad as my\nrole model in dealing with attacks\non his character. Not only was he\nslandered repeatedly in his own\nlifetime, but several attacks were\nmade on his life. Through it all, he\nstuck to the teachings of the Qur\u2019an,\nto \u2018bear patiently with what they\nsay\u2019 and turn to prayer for success\n(20:130); to \u2018turn away\u2019 from the\nslanderers, and \u2018keep on preaching\u2019 to\nthose who would listen (51:54-55). Not\nonly this, but he was deeply sensitive\nto the sentiments of others. On one\ninstance, he rebuked a Muslim for\nhaving said to a Jew that the Prophet\nMuhammad held a station higher\nthan the Prophet Moses. Though this\nwas consistent with Islam\u2019s teachings,\nhe disliked the idea that religious\nbeliefs were being expressed in a way\nthat would unnecessarily hurt the\nsentiments of others. With rights\ncome responsibilities, he taught, and\nthe commitment to social peace is one\nwe must all fulfil.\nThis teaching is not just a thing of\nthe past. A contemporary Muslim\nspiritual leader whom I follow\nexhorts the very same in this day\nMany Muslims condemn the caricaturing of the Prophet Muhammad. Photo: Huffington Post\nUMAR NASSER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nShould freedom of speech be given when it threatens social peace?\n\u201cLet it not be\nin the name\nof freedom of\nspeech that\nthe peace of\nthe entire\nworld is\ndestroyed.\u201d\nand age. After the infamous 2012\nfilm caricature of the Prophet\nMuhammad, Mirza Masroor Ahmad,\nCaliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim\nCommunity, counselled all Muslims\nto respond productively. He said\nthey should defend Islam not with\nviolent demonstrations, but through\nreforming their characters and by\neducating people about the true\ncharacter of the Prophet Muhammad.\nBut he also advised the public at large\nto use their freedoms responsibly,\nsaying, \u201cLet it not be in the name of\nfreedom of speech that the peace of\nthe entire world is destroyed.\u201d\nThe tragic attacks last week have\ngiven all sections of society much\nto think about. Condemnation has\nresounded from all quarters, but\nwe cannot follow up injury with\ninsult. We must defeat the terrorists\nby showing them that we will not\nlet extremist thinking of any kind\ndominate our mindset, and that we\nwill continue to safeguard the rights\nand sentiments of all sections of our\nsociety \u2013 an idea that is anathema to\ntheir twisted ideals. In defiance of\nthem, we would all do well to take the\nfollowing as a motto in these trying\ntimes: \u201cLet not a people\u2019s enmity\nincite you to act otherwise than with\njustice. Be always just \u2013 that is nearer\nto righteousness.\u201d (Qur\u2019an: 5:8).\n\n"

Despite\nthe fact that Charlie Hebdo has now\nbravely managed to put out their next\nissue in an act that proves they can\u2019t\nbe stopped by such savagery, there\nare still many questions that remain\nunanswered.\nThese include the debate over what\nconstitutes an expression of free\nspeech and what is crossing the line,\nand yet another debate if there is even\na line to tread.\nThe debate over printing the\ncartoons is also ongoing, with papers\nfacing a daily battle over defending\ntheir choice to replicate the images\nor not. Felix has decided not to\nreprint the images of the Prophet\nMuhammad as a show of respect\nto our diverse readership and their\nbeliefs, but we have printed the front\ncover we would have run with last\nweek if we had gone to print.\nUnlike all the national papers that\nweek in the UK, we made a cover\ncomprised of a select few previous\nCharlie Hebdo covers, to represent\nthat nous sommes Charlie too. We\nmay not agree with how tasteless\nsome of their images may have been,\nand though we would not print\neverything that the magazine have\ndone in the past, we agree they have\nthe right to print them and not face\nthe risk of death in doing so.\nIf we shy away from standing\nwith the magazine because of\nhow potentially sexist, racist or\nIslamophobic they are interpreted\nas, then we are also abandoning our\nsupport of their right to express\nviews no matter how they are\ninterpreted. The right to offend is\nnot a comfortable right to defend,\nbut it falls under the umbrella of\nfree speech, which, to succeed in its\npurpose in full, must be absolute.\nWe, as an audience then have every\nright to challenge the media if we are\noffended, and this too is an absolute\nright.\nJust like we print our centrefold, or\nour horoscopes, or even some of my\nmore frightful late night articles, we\ndo so because we\u2019ve reasoned that we\nthink they are appropriate to print\nsuch material for whatever purpose\nwe align with as a publication. We\ncan therefore exercise that right\nwithout fear for our lives. The same\nunfortunately could not be said for\nthose working for Charlie Hebdo.\nThese people weren\u2019t fighting for\nanything when they put pen to paper,\nand didn\u2019t have any real cause to\ndefend when they went to print each\nweek. They simply enjoyed pushing\nthe boundaries of humour, critical\nthought and, if nothing else, print\npure, sometimes illogical crassness\nthat most people would pick up,\nmaybe chuckle over (or simply\ngrimace at), then move on with their\nday.\nAs a publication, pushing those\nboundaries was part of their niche,\nand they occupied it in the way\nthey seemed fit. Part of our niche\nas a student paper is to inform our\ndiverse body of students about what\nis going on at University and in our\nlocal area, so printing these cartoons\nin particular does not help us in\nsucceeding as a publication.\nHowever, our niche as an editorially\nindependent newspaper is also to\nprint what we do feel is appropriate,\nwhich aligns with the principles that\nCharlie Hebdo stood for, and what\nany true free press should stand\nfor too. That is why we are Charlie\nHebdo, and we are truly saddened by\nwhat happened.\n\n"

Not just because Islam\nforbids portraying the prophet in\nimage, but because of the stereotyping\nof the image itself. A dark-skinned\nman with a skinny face, long thin\nnose and hagged beard \u2013 it\u2019s a clich\u00e9.\nA stereotype. It\u2019s reminiscent of\ndrawings of Jewish people with big\nnoses hoarding money drawn in\n1930s Germany. It\u2019s not subtle, just\ndeliberately offensive, and very\nFrench.\nIn an open and free society you\ncan say and draw what you want.\nIn practice we all live with a certain\ndegree of censorship, whether self-inflicted, culturally instilled, or\nby a government\u2019s laws. In the UK\nit\u2019s illegal to incite hatred against\nsomeone because of his or her\nreligion. It\u2019s illegal to defame or\nslander people. We self-censor \u2013 when\nFelix ran a Hangman article a few\nyears ago about Chemistry students\nusing Rohypnol to get a date, it was\nquite rightly slammed. As a student\nnewspaper, is it our role to offend our\nreadership? No \u2013 we\u2019re supposed to\nrepresent the student community of\nImperial; produced for the students,\nby the students.\nThis is why, along with mainstream\nmedia outlets, we\u2019re not reprinting\nthe images of the prophet. It\u2019s\nneedlessly offensive and if you want\nto see them a quick Google search\nthrows them up.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ever wrong\nfor anyone to publish them. A design\nblog I follow reproduced it. It\u2019s not\npossible for a design blog to ignore\nwhat is to become one of the most\niconic magazine covers of the year\nand discuss why it is so, without also\nshowing it; you can\u2019t review offensive\nliterature without reading it, or a film\nwithout watching it.\nShould Charlie Hebdo be printing\nthese images in the first place? If they\nwant to, it\u2019s their right. But as they\nare fully aware, they open themselves\nup to being justifiably criticised,\noften offensively. Interestingly, few\nseem to be doing so. Ironically, being\nviolently attacked seems to protect\nthem from insults themselves: no one\nwants to satirise murders.\nMost of us aren\u2019t Charlie Hebdo.\nWe go through life thinking about\nwhat we say, being tolerant of others\u2019\nviews, and doing our best to get on.\nIf we truly were all Charlie Hebdo,\nthen the world would be a worse\nplace. In our global society it\u2019s more\nimportant than ever to get on with\neach other. The internet, cheap travel,\nand growing economies are throwing\ncultures together and many of us are\nstill learning. We\u2019re a long way from\nthe anti-Semitism of the 1930s, but\nwe still have much to do. Recent polls\nof Jewish people living in Paris and\nthe UK shows significant numbers of\npeople fearing they have no future.\nWe all need to embrace the\nglobal culture we\u2019re faced with. It\u2019s\nPhoto: inquirer.net\nGEORGE BUTCHER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nWhilst I\u2019m writing this to\nhelp provide a Muslim\nperspective on the recent\nCharlie Hedbo attacks, I do wonder\nhow necessary that is. After all, is the\nMuslim perspective on the murder of\nover a dozen civilians really going to\nbe different to the universal human\nperspective? Do you, Imperial College\nstudents, really need reassurance that\nyour Muslim colleagues in no way\ncondone such actions? Thankfully,\nI don\u2019t think you do. When you\nthink of \u2018Islam\u2019, your personal\nexperiences and interactions with\n\u2018normal Muslims\u2019 at university can\nhelp you overcome the imagery of\nAK-47 laden, freedom-hating bigotry\nthat Fox News or the Daily Mail\nwould have others believe defines\nthis religion. But not everybody\nhas this counterbalance of personal\nexperience to fight off the recent\nignorance-fuelled hatred and fear.\nIt\u2019s only natural, therefore, that us\nUK-based Muslims feel a sense of\napprehension when we see the media\nframe such incidents as a \u2018clash of\ncivilizations\u2019 \u2013 the liberty loving\nWest vs. the barbarism of Islam.\nOne more step in what seems to be\nthe inexorable path towards making\nMuslims \u2018the other\u2019.\nLet\u2019s not let that happen. Let\u2019s\nmake the effort to identify and\ncommunicate our overwhelming\nsimilarities to others whose only\nexposure to Muslims is through the\nfear-mongering cover pages of The\nSun, and pave the way for a more\nharmonious future society.\nAs for the matter of \u2018freedom of\nspeech\u2019 \u2013 this is a topic beyond the\nmyopic snapshot of the current\ncontroversy. The decision on how far\nthe legal right to offend others with\nyour speech extends is not something\nI am interested in, as I would hope\nthis wouldn\u2019t act as the determining\nfactor in most people\u2019s behavior. (Am\nI legally entitled to make fun of you\nfor being fat?

Events progress rapidly from\nthe point where Chris is shown as\na child, to how he sails through the\ntraining to become a SEAL.\nThe training montage conveys\nnothing spectacular, aside from\nhammering home the point that\nKyle would do anything to serve his\ncountry, which he regards as the best\ncountry in the world, and that it is\nthis unshakeable mindset that drives\nhim to persevere.\nThe various deadly missions in\nIraq are the film\u2019s highlight; the\ntautly shot action sequences easily\nbuild tension. The dilemmas Kyle\nfaces alone in silence as the rooftop\nguardian for all the soldiers on the\nground, mostly involving child and\nfemale Iraqi individuals who attack\nthe troops, are effective in creating a\nconfusing moral debate with tough\nchoices to be made in a short time\nspan for Kyle. The safety of his\nbrothers in arms depends on whether\nhe decides to take the shot or not, but\nthe repetitive killing does eventually\ntake its toll on Kyle.\nIt is from this point on that the film\nunravels, never giving its leading man\nCooper enough material to portray\na man going through some form of\npost-traumatic stress, merely sticking\nhim in clich\u00e9-ridden scenarios.\nValuable supporting characters are\nnowhere to be found: Kyle\u2019s father\nis only seen in the first few minutes.\nHe is referenced once, never to be\nmentioned again. His brother too is\nseen only briefly, and doesn\u2019t return.\nMiller has a thankless, meatless\nrole as Kyle\u2019s wife, which is surprising\ngiven how her character was set\nup when the two of them first\nmeet. We are also never allowed to\nconnect with anyone besides Kyle\nhimself, which is why the on-screen\ndeaths of American soldiers whose\ncharacter names you will not be\nable to remember remain just as\nunmemorable as the deaths of the\nIraqi enemies.\nAs a viewer it is only natural to\nwonder who Kyle really is, how the\nwar affected his mental state, to what\nextent he enjoyed the killing of those\nwho threatened his beloved homeland\nand the how he coped with the process\nof adjusting to life back in America.\nBut the film is only interested in\npainting Kyle as the reluctant hero,\nand it is that much more difficult\nto relate to this one-dimensional\nindividual without a coherent story.\nTESTAMENT OF\nYOUTH\nDirector: James Kent\nScreenplay: Juliette Towhidi\nCast: Alicia Vikander Kit\nHarington, Dominic West\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nVera Brittain\u2019s First World War\nmemoir is given the big screen\ntreatment in this sweeping war\nepic, which tries to be as grand and\nspectacular as the superior classics.\nIt is a film that puts its heroine into\nunimaginable ordeals, made all the\nmore heart-breaking by its \u201cbased on\na true story\u201d nature.\nHowever the tragic aspect of its\nthemes is never quite as impactful\nas it should be, with a lack of crucial\ncharacter development standing in\nthe way of creating a truly convincing\nspark between the leads. The film tells\nan incredible, unforgettable story,\nbut it surely could have had a better\ntransition from page to screen.\nThat being said, rapidly rising star\nAlicia Vikander is excellent in the\nlead role. The narrative encompasses\nyears of Brittain\u2019s life, starting with\nher as a young rebellious female\nwanting to study at Oxford University\nin the 1910s. She even finds time\nfor love, locking eyes with Roland\nLeighton (Kit Harington), who\nimpresses her by writing poetry and\ntaking long walks in the woods.\nEverything seems to be going\nswimmingly for Vera until war breaks\nout, turning her world upside down.\nVikander embodies the many changes\nof her character fully, whilst always\nholding on to her fighting spirit\nno matter what situation she finds\nherself in.\nRoland signs up to fight for his\ncountry willingly, as a part of his\npatriotic duty, as does her brother\nEdward (Taron Egerton), and her\nclose friend, Victor Richardson\n(Colin Morgan). Little do they know\nthat this war would drag on for four\nyears, taking countless lives with it.\nVera also does her part in the war,\npostponing her university studies\nto serve as a nurse. \u201cOur youth has\nbeen stolen from us\u201d she says in her\nnarration.\nThe horrors of war are captured\nin a predictable but solid manner,\nseen through the eyes of Vera during\nher days as a nurse. There is a scene,\nechoing Gone with the Wind, in which\nlines and lines of the wounded and\ndead are slowly revealed in an aerial\nshot. The profound effect this visual\nhad in a 1939 film still works today\nin 2015.\nLess well-established are the\nsupposedly close bonds shared by the\ncharacters that ultimately matter\nin the end for that all-important\nemotional resonance. Vera and\nRoland look longingly at each other,\nbut the close of their relationship is\nheld back by unexpected restraint.\nEven the portrayal of the most tragic\nevent that hits our heroine does not\ncome across as a worthy tribute.\nThe film also neglects the other two\nimportant men in Vera\u2019s life, her\nbrother and her friend-zoned secret\nadmirer, significantly reducing their\nrelevance in the telling of her story.\nCommendable are the technical\nachievements: the warm, comfortable\npre-War period setting, followed by\nthe more frantic, harsh atmosphere\nof a deadly war; the lush costumes;\nand the effortless editing together\nof scenes that span quite a timeline.\nAnchored by a strong lead\nperformance this is by no means an\ninsult to Vera Brittain\u2019s literary work,\nbut also a film in which more should\nhave been felt in its closing moments.\nBradley snipes\nPhoto: Clint Eastwood, Village Roadshow Pictures\nLove and loss\nPhoto: James Kent, BBC Films\n\n"

Photo: Finborough\nTheatre\nMax Falkenberg explores Finborough Theatre\u2019s gruesome new production\nOffice Politics - A Car Crash of a Play\nTwo days before I went to see Office Politics, I\nwas hit by a car cycling home. Unfortunately\u2026\nit would not be the only time I came close to\ndeath that week.\nIn my time writing for Felix I\u2019ve seen shows which\nwere great, and some which were mediocre, but nothing\nhas come close to the complete travesty of Ben Worth\u2019s\nOffice Politics at the Theatre 503 in Battersea. Maybe\nI\u2019m boring \u2013 after all a hefty chunk of the audience\nlaughed throughout, but crass, poorly stereotyped,\nimmature rubbish just doesn\u2019t cut it for me.\nOffice Politics is a play about\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Office\nPolitics. Mindblowing, I know. Now, think of all the\nstandard, boring office stereotypes you can think of;\nthe whiny jealous woman; the coke fuelled banker; the\nslightly less attractive, less coke fuelled, less successful\nbanker; the posh private school boy whose \u2018daddy\u2019 got\nhim an internship; the \u2018chav\u2019 who\u2019s gotten the same\ninternship; and the slightly ditsy bimbo who\u2019s sleeping\nwith her boss. Now put them all together with dialogue\nwritten by a hyperactive fourteen year old, and the\nresult? You guessed it, Ben Worth\u2019s Office Politics.\nOk, I admit, it hasn\u2019t exactly been a glowing start to\nthis review, but there really were very few redeeming\nfeatures. The show is made up of three twenty minute\nplays which stand-alone and link with the office theme.\nAlthough the theme is clear, the three plays display\nlittle story. Rather, the plays form stories about the\ncharacters interaction with colleagues. In principle,\nthis is not a bad thing, giving the play an opportunity\nto play with straight and comedic characters. But\ninstead, everyone seemed to linger in the middle. None\nwere really funny enough to justify the abysmal story\nline, and equally, none were serious without seeming\ncompletely farcical.\nI could go on but very little remains to be said. While\nthe show was generally let down by its writing, none\nof the ensemble cast really stood out, and the staging,\nwhile suiting the venue, was an almost blank stage\nthroughout. It is a shame considering the theme has\ngreat potential for situational comedy (Ricky Gervais\u2019\nThe Office etc.), but on this occasion it simply wasn\u2019t\nworth it.\nMAX FALKENBERG\n\"None\nwere really\nfunny\nenough to\njustify the\nabysmal\nstory line.\"\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t disappear into thin air. Not\nin this country. Not in Canada.\u201d\nPig Girl is a gruesome story we\u2019ve\nheard all too often. Although\na work of fiction, the play\nis inspired by the disappearance\nand murders of predominantly\nindigenous women over a number\nof years in Canada. Plagued by poor\ncommunication and the indifference\nof police forces, the carnage led to\nthe deaths of thirty three women at\na single pig farm on the outskirts of\nVancouver.\nThe play depicts the interactions\nbetween a dying woman and her\nkiller, the pain and devastation of the\nwoman\u2019s sister and a police officer\u2019s\nrole in the investigation. Staged at the\nintimate Finborough Theatre, the\naudience watches as the killer slowly\nunfolds his desire to hang the woman\nby a pig hook, as he has done with\ncountless women before her.\nThe desperation of the dying\nwoman is beautifully played by\nKirsten Forster whose mentality\ntowards her captor is fascinating from\nstart to finish. Perfectly balanced\nbetween anger and a necessity to\nplead with the killer, the comforting\nstories she tells from her childhood\nonly seems to deepen the pain her\nsister feels recounting the same\nstories to the police.\nIn contrast to his victim, the\nkiller, played by Damien Lyne, has\nan incredibly harrowing, obsessive\nconsistency in what almost feels\nlike an out of control fetishistic\ngame. Lyne\u2019s physicality perfectly\nmatches the nervousness and mental\ninstability of the killer, but also\nhighlights how he is emotionally\ndamaged in a very similar manner\nto his victim. While the killer and\nhis victim\u2019s story develops over a\nnumber of days, the sister and police\nofficer\u2019s story unravels continuously,\nspread over a number of years. What\nstarts a plea for attention from the\nsister, played by Olivia Dornley, turns\ninto an officer seeking her help after\nyears of uncertainty. Placed either\nside of the victim and her killer,\ntheir conversation accompanies the\nviolence from a perspective even\nmore painful for an audience since it\nfeels so much closer to what could be\nour own experiences.\nGenerally, the delivery of the story\nand the commitment of the actors\ngive the story a powerful and effective\nnarrative. However, the script does\nlittle to show real development in\nthe characters. Except for the police\nofficer, played superbly by Joseph\nRye, the characters feel like they\nare emotionally at the same place\nthroughout the performance. While\nfor Dornley, this seems to be a result\nof the writing, the more graphic\nmoments between the woman and\nher killer are at times stunted from\nthe difficulty of portraying violence\nin such a small, intimate space.\nLikewise, the use of the pig hook feels\nunconvincing. Although I appreciate\nhanging an actress upside down is\nnot easy, I feel the director Helen\nDonnelly could have taken a few\nmore risks throughout the staging.\nThis said, the limitations of the space\nmake it understandable that some\nimages could not have been achieved\nfrom a practical standpoint.\nThe overall result is a dark,\npowerful production which has\nall the hallmarks of an excellent\npsychological play. Colleen Murphy\u2019s\nscript does a good job of balancing the\nemotional stance of all the characters\nOffice Politics was performed at Theatre503 in\nBattersea\nwithout at any point feeling\noverbearing.\nAlthough not a production which\nshould be seen for enjoyment, the\nshow is definitely worth seeing for its\nrealistic depiction of such a horrible\nstory.\nPig Girl is showing at the Finborough\nTheatre until 16th\nFebruary. Tickets are\n\u00a318, \u00a316 for concessions\n\"The overall\nresult is\na dark,\npowerful\nproduction\"\n\"The script\ndoes little\nto show real\ndevelopment\nin the\ncharacters\"\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 9\nFELIX 16.01.2015\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy all the fuss about Charlie Hebdo?\nThe news over the past week\nhas been dominated by stories\nabout the terrorist attacks\nin Paris, killing 17 people, with the\nsatirical magazine Charlie Hebdo\namong the targets. Also reported,\nbut to a far lesser extent, are attacks\nby Boko Haram extremists in Baga,\nNigeria, resulting in thousands of\ndeaths. With all the media interest\nfocused on Charlie Hebdo and France,\nthe horrifying events in Nigeria have\nsomewhat fallen by the wayside. Why\nis it the case that these attacks have\nreceived far less media attention, not\njust globally, but also in Nigeria itself?\nIs it the case that we in the Western\nworld consider the lives of those lost\nin France more valuable and worthy\nof attention?\nOne reason is of course, practicality.\nThere are thousands of journalists in\nFrance and Paris, within quick and\neasy reach of the action. In contrast,\nBaga is difficult to access, with very\nfew international journalists nearby.\nWhile the news story is certainly\nmore significant in terms of lives lost,\nreporting on it is far more perilous.\nThe attacks in Paris were motivated\nby vengeance for satire of the Prophet\nMuhammad in the press, and many\npublications have been fearful of\nrepercussions upon reporting on, and\nreproducing the original material.\nDespite this, the overwhelming\nattitude of the media has been of\ncautious support for Charlie Hebdo.\nWhile this attack has shown that\nthe danger is real, the peril of being\non the ground, reporting on the\ndevastating attacks in Nigeria is on\nanother scale entirely. With hordes\nof extremists roving through villages,\nrazing them to the ground, and\nkilling hundreds, even thousands of\ninnocent people that they encounter,\nthe risk is far greater.\nThe attacks in France are more\nunique than the latest Boko Haram\nattacks. While these carry the\nhorrifying new aspect of enslaving\nlittle girls to use as suicide bombers,\nthese acts by Boko Haram have\nalmost become commonplace,\nflooding our newsfeeds every week.\nWhile incidents such as those in\nFrance are not entirely unheard of\n\u2013 the threat was real enough for the\nCharlie Hebdo offices to have police\nprotection \u2013 they are certainly more\nunusual, and far more relatable. It\nis the complete shock that an office\nin a European city could become the\nsetting for such a tragedy that makes\nthis story so compelling. We live and\nwork in places like this and we rarely\ndoubt our safety. The ease of empathy\nleads to a morbid fascination, and the\nmedia reflects this.\nThe journalists themselves, who\nreport the news that we read, will\nbe feeling these attacks personally.\nWhile every journalist is aware of\nthe risks, the reality is jarring. The\npassion of the media itself on this\nstory will drive the reporting further,\nraising it higher.\nPolitical leaders from around\nthe world have spoken out in\ncondemnation of the actions of\nthese terrorists, and in many cases,\ntravelled to France to participate\nin rallies of support. All over the\nworld, people have been shocked\nby these events. The Nigerian\nmassacres have been treated with\nsimilar revulsion, with many western\nworld leaders issuing statements of\nhorror, but the President of Nigeria\nhimself, Goodluck Jonathan, has\ndenounced the attacks in Paris but\nhasn\u2019t even acknowledged the attacks\nin his own country. The Nigerian\ngovernment has done little to\ncontain Boko Haram, and without\nthis, the seriousness of these attacks\nis diminished. The striking sight of\nworld leaders standing together in\nParis, uniting against a common\ncause, is such dramatic imagery; it is\neasy to report. In the case of Nigeria,\nthere are no sweeping statements of\npurpose; there is nothing as visually\neffective. To put it bluntly, it doesn\u2019t\nmake such good entertainment,\nand that is, ultimately, the main\nprerogative of the media.\nThe Western world isn\u2019t indifferent\nto the suffering and slaughter of\nAfricans. Other similar stories, such\nas the kidnapping by Boko Haram of\n276 schoolchildren in Nigeria, have\nbeen as high-profile as any Western\ntragedy has ever been, and have\nstruck a chord with people all over\nthe world. But with the numerous\nbombings, shootings, kidnappings,\nand enslavements happening at the\nhands of Boko Haram in West Africa,\nthey lack novelty, and people lose\ninterest. This is natural, of course,\nbut let us not forget the ongoing\natrocities that are masked by the\nlatest news. They remain worthy of\nour respect and attention, and these\nlives lost deserve not to be forgotten.\nWhile we may be morbidly enthralled\nwith watching events unfold, we\nshould remember that many people\ndo not have this luxury, and are being\nsubjected to other horrors.\nBaga village in Nigeria was razed to the ground last week in attacks by Boko Haram. Photo: abc7chicago.com / AP Photo / Haruna Umar\nJe suis TESSA DAVEY\nCOMMENT EDITOR\nParis attacks have recieved widespread global attention, but why?\n\u201cIs it the case\nthat we in the\nWestern world\nconsider the\nlives of those\nlost in France\nmore valuable\nand worthy of\nattention?\u201d\n\"... hordes of\nextremists\nroving through\nvillages, razing\nthem to the\nground\"\n\"In the case\nof Nigeria... it\ndoesn\u2019t make\nsuch good\nentertainment\"\n\n"

He committed\nsuicide just eight years later.\nEquality in sport has come a long\nway since Justin Fashanu\u2019s death.\nFrom 23 openly lesbian, gay and\nbisexual Olympians competing at the\nOlympics in London, to role models\nsuch as Jason Collins in basketball,\nRobbie Rogers in football, and Tom\nDaley in diving. Add in Casey Stoney\nwho has captained both Arsenal and\nEngland\u2019s women\u2019s football team, and\nyou can see that there definitely has\nbeen a change.\nHowever, there is still a long\nway to go to challenge perceptions\nand problems facing lesbian, gay,\nbisexual and transgender sports\npeople. Thankfully, there are groups\nand campaigns such as \u201cFootball vs\nHomophobia\u201d and \u201cPride Sports\u201d\nwhich are working to challenge these\nissues.\nYet it is still not uncommon to hear\nhomophobic slurs on the side-lines of\nsome large sports matches or sporting\nprofessionals using homophobic\nremarks behind the scenes.\nOften transgender people who want\nto be involved in sports face huge\nbarriers too, and it is often unclear\non how they can be involved with\neach National Governing Body of\neach sport having a different stance\nor policy.\nWhat about University sport and\nstudents?\nA recent survey carried out by\nthe National Union of Students\ncalled \u2018Out in Sport\u2019 found that\nnearly 50% of LGBT students who\ndo not participate in sport find the\nculture around sport alienating or\nunwelcoming.\nFurthermore, almost 20% of\nLGBT students who participate in\nteam sport are not open about their\nsexuality to anyone, and of those a\nfurther 20% are worried it might\nresult in verbal or physical abuse on\naccount of homophobia, transphobia\nor biphobia.\nSport is such an integral part of\nmany students\u2019 life at university.\nWhether one competes in the elite of\ntheir field, joins a club or a team to\ndevelop their skills or make friends,\nor just gets together with students\nfrom their class, research group or\nhalls to play a game in Hyde Park, the\nfact is that sport does an excellent job\nat bringing people together.\nEvery student at Imperial,\nwho wants to, should feel able to\nparticipate in all the sport offered\nthrough our huge number and\nwide variety of teams and clubs at\nImperial.\nAs part of this, we\u2019ve decided to\nresearch the experiences of students\nwho take part in sport at Imperial. We\nwant to find barriers to engagement\nor if there are positive experiences of\nLGBT students feeling accepted and\nwelcomed as part of a team. (We want\nto celebrate those!)\nFeeling accepted regardless of\nsexuality means that students will\nfeel more comfortable and able to\nfocus on their sport, and will be able\nto play better.\nOnce we have the results of the\nsurvey, we will look to identify\nchanges we can make to ensure that\nteams feel supported in tackling\nhomophobia in their sport, or\ncreating an easier method of\nreporting incidents of homophobia,\nor running a campaign where we ask\nsports teams to come out for equality.\nYou can take part in the survey\nvia the recent \u2018Inclusive Sport at\nImperial: Survey\u2019 post on the Union\nwebsite.\nAll responses are confidential and\nmost questions are optional should\nyou uncomfortable with disclosing\ncertain types of information.\nFurthermore, we will be holding\nin-depth interview sessions to further\nour research, so please do your note\ndown your email if you are interested.\nAlternatively, you can contact me at\nicu-lgbt@imperial.ac.uk, along with any\nquestions you might have regarding\nthis survey.\nEnjoyment of sport shouldn't be barred by sexual orientation and the survey will take a shot to address homophobia on the sports field.\nPhoto: Wikipedia\nKyle Hellemans wants to know your experience in sport\n\u201cFeeling\naccepted\nregardless\nof sexuality\nmeans that\nstudents will\nfeel more\ncomfortable\nand able to\nfocus on\ntheir sport.\u201d\n\u201cNearly 50%\nof LGBT\nstudents\nwho do not\nparticipate\nin sport find\nthe culture\naround sport\nalienating.\u201d\nIf you are distressed and\nneed someone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr\nhelpline):\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.samaritans.\norg.uk\nAnxiety Help\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.anxietyuk.\norg.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite:www.nopanic.org.\nuk\nEating Disorders\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAddiction\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite: www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling\nService\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.\nuk\nImperial College Health\nCentre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail:healthcentre@ic.ac.\nuk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nHelplines\nand\nresources\n\n"

    "content": "6 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n16.01.2015\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAn increase of the Amenities\nfund from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32.00\nper person per week has\nbeen recommended by Imperial\nCollege Union. The recommendation\nwas made as part of the Student\nAmenities Fund Review, and was\npresented to Union Council on\nTuesday by the Union President, Tom\nWheeler.\nThe recommendations came from a\nsurvey taken by current hall seniors,\nhall committees and the Wardening\nTeams. The majority of the responses\nsuggested that a budget of \u00a32 per\nperson per week would be preferable\nto the current allocation of \u00a31.50 set\nat the beginning of this year.\nThe Amenities fund, used by halls\nto run events and socials for students,\nwas slashed at the beginning of the\nacademic year to a flat rate of \u00a31.50\nper student per week, sparking\noutrage from wardens and hall\nseniors.\n\u00a31 of this was paid for directly\nby this year\u2019s freshers cohort rent,\nwhilst the College paid for the\nremaining 50p, making \u00a3152,190 in\ntotal available for all students for all\nactivities in the coming year.\nHowever, next year the College will\nwithdraw their contribution, meaning\nstudents will be paying double into\nthe amenities fund compared to what\nstudents are paying this year.\nThe slash in funds amounted to a\ndecrease of approximately \u00a3150,000\nwhen compared to last year\u2019s figures.\nCollege were unable to explain where\nthis \u00a3150,000 has disappeared to\nwhen Felix investigated the changes\nto the fund last term (Issue 1584),\nalthough it may have not been\nexplicitly documented in the first\nplace.\nWheeler told Council that due to\nthe incredibly large sum of money\ntaken each year through rent alone,\nthis \u00a3150,000 difference may not\nhave been specifically documented.\nHe also told Council that although\naround \u00a315.5 million is collected each\nyear from rent, the Union does not\nknow how exactly the rent prices were\npreviously calculated.\nHowever Wheeler was keen to stress\nthe importance of transparency, and\nsaid he wants students to understand\nexactly what they are paying for in\nthe future. If the recommendations\nare put into practice, students will\nreceive an invoice for their student\naccommodation at the start of the\nyear that will show the costs of\ntheir rent, and also the separate\ncompulsory payment to the amenities\nfund.\nThe funds are now managed\nthrough eActivities, with hall\ncommittees functioning similar to\na club or society and the amenities\nfunds paid directly to the Union at\nthe beginning of the year. Wheeler\ncountered the argument that halls\ncould potentially underspend one\nyear and have funds carried over\nfor use by the next intake by setting\nspending timelines and ensuring that\nhalls are on target. This will hopefully\nensure that the money paid for by\none cohort will not be rolled over and\nspent the next year.\nOne current hall senior explained\nto Felix that the cut in the funds this\nyear have had the opposite effect the\ncollege may have hoped it would have\nin the first place. He told us: \u201cI think\nthat College has this idea that events\nthat cater to students who drink\nexclude those that don\u2019t.\n\u201cHowever, with the reduction in\namenities fund this year, events that\nare the easiest and cheapest to run\nare those that involve alcohol and we\nhave actually seen that the events that\ndon\u2019t are the first to go because of the\nhigher cost.\n\u201cIt is so much easier to order a load\nof alcohol for a social in the common\nroom over trips to the theatre or\nabroad that cost more money; money\nthanks to the slashes in the fund we\ndon\u2019t really have now.\u201d\nHall seniors however remained\nUnion review recommends an increase\nin amenity funds for hall activities\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF\nsceptical of the recommendations\nto improve transparency. \u201cThe\nargument that they are increasing\ntransparency by separating the fund\nfrom rent is just another way for\ncollege to pretend they are trying\nto reduce costs whilst really looking\nafter their own profit margin.\u201d\nThe review also recommended a\nreview of the eActivities system to\nimprove the \u201cspeed and usability of\nthe interface,\u201d something that will no\ndoubt be well-received by any student\ninvolved in the administration of\nclubs and societies.\nThe Union is paid approximately\n\u00a310,000 by the college to review the\nAmenities fund for the Amenities\nFund Review Group, a panel\nconsisting of Imperial College Union\nStaff, Sabbaticals, and College staff\nincluding Debra Humphris, the\nVice Provost of Education. The\nreview will then be considered by\nthe Vice Provost Advisory Group for\nEducation, a board within college that\noversees the running of halls amongst\nother things.\nTom Wheeler spoke to Felix after\ncouncil about the recommendations.\n\u201cWe are really pleased that the future\nFirst Council of the year fails to meet quorum\nUnion Council met on Tuesday\nfor the first time this year,\nalthough with attendance\nbeing so low was unable to meet\nquorum. This means that there\nweren\u2019t enough students present\nto allow any papers to pass and any\ndecisions to be made. Email votes are\ntaking place instead on the papers\ndiscussed.\nStudents present at Council casted\nvotes on the papers out of interest,\nalthough the votes were more so to\ngauge opinion and were not officially\nrecorded.\nPapers presented included the\nrecommendations for changes to\nthe Amenities funds, a proposal for\nannual general meetings, suggestions\nto reallocate the functions of the\nnow defunct executive committee,\nand also whether or not the votes of\nindividual council members should\nbe recorded and then published.\nThe idea of publishing the votes of\nnamed individuals has proven to be\na contentious issue; although those\npresent rhetorically voted in favour\nof publishing the choices made by\nelected representatives, it has not\nbeen a popular opinion in the past.\nWith the Union having invested\n\u00a32,000 for electronic voting pads,\nthey are already able to record which\nmember voted in favour of or against\nany paper. However, some people\nhave previously voiced displeasure of\nthe idea of their being a permanent\nrecord of voting decisions. Said one\nCouncil member, \u201cIf that motion\npasses, I\u2019m just going to abstain from\neverything.\u201d\nSome students suggested that it\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF\nwould make council members think\nmore about their vote before they\ncast it, but also that some topics could\nstill be voted on anonymously on an\nad hoc basis.\nEmail votes have to be cast by\nthe 16th of January by all council\nmembers on these papers, not just\nthose who were not present.\nPaul Beaumont, Council Chair,\nspoke to Felix about the importance\nof attending Council. Said Paul: \u201cI\ncan completely understand that at\nbusy times of the year for students, it\nwill be difficult for Council to reach\nquorum (January exams being a\ndetails of the Amenities Fund, now\nnamed Hall Activities Fund, will be\ndecided yearly by feedback from the\nstudents that have administered it\nthat year.\nWe had a really great discussion\nabout the recommendations in\nUnion Council and we look forward\nto seeing those changes put in place\nnext year.\u201d\nDebra Humphris also spoke to\nFelix about the recommendations.\nSaid Debra: \u201cIt\u2019s been really helpful\nto receive feedback on the Student\nAmenities Fund from Imperial\nCollege Union following their\nconsultation with students on the\nchanges put in place last term.\n\u201cThese changes increased the\ntransparency and accountability of\nthe Fund by putting it in the hands\nof the students who benefit from it.\nIt is now fully administered through\nthe Union\u2019s eActivities system, and\nhas received additional funding from\nthe Education Office to support this\nprocess during the transition.\n\u201cPutting these decisions into the\nhands of students is a really positive\nstep and I\u2019ll be advising the Provost\nboard of these changes in March.\u201d\nprime example).\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally understandable that\nelected students might have to\nmiss a meeting or two due to other\ncommitments. It is a pity that some\nmembers of Council do not attend at\nall though.\n\u201cCouncil is the place where\nstudents elect their most senior\nrepresentatives to, and for them to\nthen not use their vote is frankly\nconfusing to me.\n\u201cIt seems both a waste of time for\nthe students who bothered to vote,\nand for the people who run for the\npositions.\u201d\nSource: Selkirk Hall website\n\n"

Caroline was prepared to\nenter corporate life, having accepted\na position in a consultancy firm.\nWe caught up one afternoon in the\nlate summer sunshine, and started\nto daydream together again. We\nused to toy with the idea of starting\na business, and were convinced that\nmaking cosmetics was the field for\nus. Caroline even bought a hundred\nempty lip balm containers at one\npoint, and we set up a rudimentary\nkitchen laboratory. However, we\nrealised that for two penniless\ngraduates, it was just not feasible to\nstart a cosmetics business without\nany capital. Thus it was back to the\ndrawing board.\nThe seed for Clotho London had\nbeen planted during our post-uni\ngirls trip to Marrakech earlier in the\nsummer. We were preparing to go\nout one evening and I was making a\nfuss, deliberating over what to wear.\nCaroline kindly asked me if I would\nlike to take one of her dresses. She\nhad brought it along for the trip but\nhad never worn it, despite owning\nit for years. I felt guilty for taking\nher clothes, but she insisted, saying\nthat otherwise it would be a waste.\nI tried it on and loved it so much\nthat I basically never took it off all\nsummer! Remembering this moment,\nwe thought that many girls must have\nitems that they never wear any more.\nThe textile industry is a beast that\nconsumes huge amounts of resources\nlike water and fuel. Almost 150\nmillion tons of shoes and clothing are\nsold worldwide every year, yet only\na very small part finds its way back\ninto the production cycle \u2013 especially\ndisappointing since textiles are in\nthe top five landfill materials that\ncan be either recycled or repurposed\nfor other uses. The textiles industry\nis also often associated with poor\nworking conditions in order to supply\ncheap fashion. We can\u2019t ask people to\nstop buying new clothes \u2013 that would\nbe like asking people to give up food\nin favour of soylent. No one would do\nit. So we came up with Clotho London,\nwhich allows people to satisfy their\nmaterialistic wants and needs with\nminimal impact on the environment,\nlowering the demand for cheaper\nitems that may be produced by\nworkers in unacceptable conditions.\nRecent graduate Vivien Tang introduces you to Clotho and the u\nClotho essentially encourages women\nto exchange their clothing \u2013 we\ncollect items from their homes to\nmake it as convenient as possible. The\nitems are then sorted, photographed\nand listed on our online shop. For the\nitems that they submit, our customers\nreceive credit, which they can redeem\nfor new outfits in our shop. We charge\njust a transaction fee for each new\nitem that the customer purchases.\nOnce we had properly fleshed out\nour ideas for Clotho, we decided\nthat the next step would be to test\nout our clothes exchange idea. So\nwe organised a \u2018Bitch \u2018n\u2019 Switch\u2019\nevent \u2013 an evening chez Caroline\nwith all of our favourite girlfriends,\nwhere we brought along our old\nclothes. We then swapped items with\neach other over nibbles, drinks and\ngossip. The evening was a success; our\nfriends went home that night with\ncompletely new wardrobes, and were\nsupportive about us taking the plunge\nto set up Clotho. With nothing to lose,\nwe threw caution to the wind and got\nto work.\nCaroline had a meeting with\nAlice Bentinck, the co-founder\nof Entrepreneur First (a start up\naccelerator programme), to ask if\nwe could join this year\u2019s cohort late\nwith our business idea. Alice must\nbe inundated with requests like this\non a daily basis, so told us that she\nwould consider it if we could prove\nthat we had hundreds of transacting\ncustomers in a month\u2019s time. We\ninterpreted her words quite literally,\nand set ourselves a one-month\nchallenge. Whilst that seemed\ninitially to be ample time for us to\nachieve the goal, a quick breakdown\nof the month ahead revealed that we\nhad essentially a week to persuade as\nmany girls as possible to sign up for a\ntrial run. We hastily cobbled together\na rudimentary landing page with\na signup form. Armed with iPads,\nwe started to roam around London,\npouncing on stylish girls to persuade\nthem to sign up. We covered most of\nthe London universities, Westfields,\nHigh Street Kensington, and the\npubs around Fulham. Persuading\nstrangers to signup to something\nthat essentially didn\u2019t exist yet was\nmore difficult than we imagined, but\nwe gritted our teeth through all the\nrejections and managed to acquire a\nlist of just over 400 girls at the end of\nthe week. After calling everyone on\nour list, we assembled 50 girls who\nwere available to take part in our\npilot, and began collecting their items.\nWe spent that week mostly on the\nUnderground, annoying commuters\nby taking up too much space with our\nhuge bags of clothes.\nMy bedroom was converted into our\nphotography studio by taping white\npaper to the floor. With absolutely\nno idea as to what we were doing, we\nbegan pointing a camera at clothes\nand snapping photos. We thought\n\"Our\nroutine\nconsisted\nof us\nmaking\na cameo\nappearance\nin the lab\nand then\nsneaking\noff to the\ncomputer\nroom to\nwatch\nGossip\nGirl.\"\n\"We\nthought\nthat many\ngirls must\nhave items\nthat they\nnever wear\nany more.\"\nExchange your unwanted clothes for\n\n"

    "content": "28 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n16.01.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTaking up a position round the\ncorner from Angel station in\nNorth London, this theatre\nforms one of the centres of London\u2019s\ndance scene. Their plans for this\nseason are set to combine stalwarts of\nclassical dance with the very freshest\nof new talents.\nThey start off with Plexus (22nd\nand 23rd\nJanuary; tickets from \u00a312),\na new commission conceived for the\nJapanese dancer Kaori Ito, who will -over the course of an hour - explore\na forest of shimmering strings that\nseem to float over the stage.\nThey then move on to a celebration\nof Richard Alston Dance Company\n(26th\nand 27th\nJanuary; tickets\nfrom \u00a312), whose energetic, vivid\nchoreography has made them one\nof the most respected institutions of\ncontemporary British dance. Taking\non four pieces, this promises to be an\nexplosion of high-impact dance.\nFebruary sees the celebration of\nsome of Sadler\u2019s Wells\u2019 freshest\ntalents, when three of their\nAssociates \u2013 Hofesh Shechter, Crystal\nPite, and Kate Prince \u2013 take to the\nstage to present their latest works (5th\n-8th\nFebruary; tickets from \u00a312).\nLater in the month sees Wayne\nMcGregor return to the stage with his\nDance\nJennifer Hayes, Nathan Goodman,\nand full Richard Alston Company\nPhoto: Chris Nash\nWNO Walther (Raymond Very) &\nHans Sachs (Bryn Terfel). Photo:\nCatherine Ashmore\nSadler\u2019s Wells Theatre\nThe other big daddy of London\ndance, the ROH generally\ncommissions more traditional\nwork, focussing on ballet and opera.\nThis season is set to be no exception,\nstarting off with their production of\nDon Quixote (Until 22nd\nJanuary; day\ntickets available), created by Cubanborn dancer Carlos Acosta - perhaps\nthe closest thing the dance world has\nto a superstar. This promises to be an\nevening of Spanish flair and pasion,\nplayed out across the stage.\nWe then have something more\nclassical: John Cranko\u2019s 1965\nadaptation of Pushkin\u2019s novel Eugene\nOnegin. Onegin (24th\nJanuary - 27th\nFebruary; tickets from \u00a35) features\na range of different dancing styles,\nranging from sensuous ballet duets to\nmodern and folk, all set to music by\nTchaikovsky.\nThe love for Tchaikovsky is\ncontinued into their next centrepiece:\na revival of Swan Lake (10th\nFebruary\n- 9th\nApril; tickets from \u00a36). Surely\none of the greatest of classical\nballets, this production uses the\n1895 choreography, and features a\nwealth of lush costumes reflecting\nthe opulence of the Imperial Russian\ncourt.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just classical\nRoyal Opera House\nproduction of Atomos (13th & 14th\nFebruary; tickets from \u00a312), which\nreceived a rapturous reception on its\npremier in 2013.\nFinally, they take a step back\nfrom cutting-edge dance, instead\ninviting the English National\nBallet to perform Modern Masters\n(10th\n- 15th\nMarch; tickets from\n\u00a312), a celebration of three of the\n20th century\u2019s most influential\nchoreographers: Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n, John\nNeumeier and William Forsythe.\nThis caps off what is set to be a very\nexciting season.\nAlthough on after the end of\nterm, it is worth noting that Sadler\u2019s\nWells will again be welcoming the\nTanztheatre Wuppertal Pina\nBausch, the brainchild of the famed\nlate German choreographer. After\na decade\u2019s absence their production\nof Ahnen (23rd\n- 26th\nApril) is being\nrevived, along with a piece never\nbefore seen in the UK, Auf dem\nGebirge hat man ein Geschrei geh\u00f6rt\n(15th\n- 18th\nApril). While Bausch\u2019s work\nhas always been hugely popular, the\nlast couple of years have seen a surge\nin interest, and therefore it is highly\nlikely that these tickets will sell out.\nBook early to avoid being let down!\nOpera\nfare on offer here; February sees\na welcome return of Ballet Black\n(10th\n- 14th\nFebruary; tickets from \u00a38),\nwho present a dynamic programme\nof mixed dances from some of the\nworld\u2019s leading choreographers.\nThe company, which is made up of\nclassically trained black and Asian\ndancers, forms a refreshing change\nfrom the stereotypical image of most\nballet companies.\nThis contemporary theme is\ncontinued in their production of\nDraft Works (24th\n& 26th\nFebruary;\nday tickets available), in which the\nRoyal Ballet perofrm choreography\nstill in the making. Eschewing the\ntraditional lighting and costumes,\nthis should be a stripped back\nappraisal of the power of modern\ndance.\nFinally, we have something much\nmore provocative from the ensemble\nBallet de Lorraine, who perform\nCover (11th\n- 14th\nMarch; tickets\nfrom \u00a35), a new ballet from Israeli\nchoreographer Itamar Serussi. Set to\nmusic from Berlioz, this production\nwill tell the tale of a young artist\nwhose passion for a woman drives\nhim to euphoria, and eventually to\nthe edge of madness.\nAs its name would suggest,\nthe Royal Opera House is\nthe place to go for opera in\nLondon. They start this season with\na passionate tale of love, rebellion,\nand the French Revolution. Andrea\nCh\u00e9nier (20th\nJanuary - 6th\nFebruary;\nday tickets available) was written by\nUmberto Giordant in 1896, and tells\nthe tale of a young poet\u2019s quest for\nlove across the barricades.\nWe then have an opportunity to see\none of the earliest operas by that great\nmaster, Richard Wagner; Der fliegende\nHoll\u00e4nder (5th\n- 24th\nFebruary; day\ntickets available) is a dark exploration\nof trust and posession. It centres\naround The Flying Dutchman, a\ncursed man who can only come\nashore every seven years. His only\nhope for redemption is in the love of\nthe beautiful Senta.\nThis classical theme continues,\nwith a production of one of the most\nwell-loved operas of all time: Mozarts\nDie Zauberfl\u00f6te (23rd\nFebruary - 11th\nMarch; day tickets available). A firm\nfavourite amongst opera-goers since\nits premier, this mystical story has\nfound a home in the ROH; don\u2019t\nexpect many radical reinterpretations\nfrom this version by David McVicar,\nRoyal Opera House\nThis season is looking to be an\nexceptional one for opera.\nThe ENO is once again\nexperimenting with reinventions\nof classics with their take on\nWagner\u2019s comedy The Mastersingers\nof Nuremburg (7th\nFebruary - 10th\nMarch; tickets from \u00a316). It is always\na pleasure to see how truthfully\nthe ENO manages to conserve\nthe character of the original work\nthrough translation but in the hands\nof critically acclaimed director\nRichard Jones, I am sure it will\nmaintain all the epicness of Wagner\u2019s\nscore.\nENO follow on with La Traviata\n(9th\nFebruary - 13th\nMarch; tickets\nfrom \u00a312), Verdi\u2019s epic, in which the\nbeautifully brittle Violetta is placed\nEnglish National Opera\nbut then again, maybe some things\nare better left alone. You are pretty\nmuch guarenteed to have outstanding\nsinger, incredible costumes, and killer\narias from the Queen of the Night.\nIf modern opera is more your thing,\nyou are going to love Bertolt Brecht\nand Kurt Weil\u2019s eerily poignant work\nRise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\n(10th\nMarch - 4th\nApril) at the Royal\nOpera House. A satire on the fickle\nnature of consumerism, this opera is\nas relevant as ever ninety years after\nit was originally produced. Telling\nthe story of the founding of a city\nof consumption and excess and its\neventual decay, you can easily draw\nparallels with many of the new cities\nemerging in the East.\nFinally, we finish the term with\nanother pillar of the opera world:\nPuccini\u2019s Madama Butterfly (20th\nMarch - 11th\nApril; tickets on sale 27th\nJanuary), which spins a wicked tale\nof East against West, modern against\nclassical, tradition against industry.\nCentring around the abortive\nrelationship between an American\nsoldier and his Japanese bride, we\npromise that this will leave you in\ntears.\nin an untenable position, forced to\ndefend her lover\u2019s reputation. A tragic\ntale of the moral demands society\nplaces on women, it is an opera that\nstill resonates today.\nTheir next production also has\na woman at the centre, a rarity in\nopera, and one thing that makes The\nIndian Queen (26th\nFebruary - 14th\nMarch; tickets from \u00a312), on show\nat the ENO, so special. A personal\nperspective on Europe\u2019s first\nencounter with the Mayans in the\nNew World, director Peter Sellars\nhas combined Purcell\u2019s score with\nnew text inspired by Nicaraguan\nauthor Rosario Aguilar, all on a set\ndesigned by LA graffiti artist Gronk\n\u2013 a blending of art forms that will\nguarantee a unique experience.\nFrom the Barbican Centre, we\nhave the London premiere of\nNicola LeFanu\u2019s opera Tokaido\nRoad: A Journey after Hiroshige (25th\nFebruary; tickets \u00a310, \u00a35 for conces-sions) performed for one night only.\nIt\u2019s quite rare for the Barbican Centre\nto put on an opera - they are perhaps\nbetter known for their theatre and\ndance - but this should be a hot ticket\nBarbican Centre\nfor this season. The work tells the\nstory of the artist Hiroshige and his\njourney along Japan\u2019s ancient Eastern\nsea road from Edo to Kyoto. In an\namalgamation of art, music, mime\nand poetry, LeFanu has created a\nfusion of East and West in what\npromises to be possibly the most\ninteresting opera production on show\nthis term.\n\n"

Like, I don\u2019t need a\nlamp desk or another dressing gown but she might start crying again about me\nleaving. So ready to go back to uni though, I have missed my hallmates so much\nSunday 11th January\nIt was kind of odd being back in halls, with a roommate and a single bed. The\nfridge is a state in the kitchen and not full of free food and I forgot how cold it\nis without heating. I forgot that weird musty smell all the corridors seem to have\nWhatsapping home friends straight away about being back in London and how\ncrap it is. They are taking the piss as apparently all I spoke about at home was\nhow good London was but I dunno I thought I was pretty modest and humble about\nliving in the city.\nI unpacked then went straight to the library (fourth floor). Am still here.\nMonday 12th of January\nHave been in the library for 23 hours and no longer can focus on the page.\nExam is tomorrow and I only managed to do 80 out of the 600 hours I needed to\ncover each lecture twice then do outside reading. Have literally only revised about\n10 lectures out of 50 but have spent all of today working out what is most likely to\ncome up then reading a load of random wiki pages surrounding the topic.\nThat should pull me through, right? I ran into my lab partner in the library and\nhe said he had only really looked at his notes a bit, and hadn\u2019t really revised at all.\nHe reckons he will scrape a 2.1 he said, which he said he is cool with because its\nliterally only 60% which is basically a low B and he got three A* at a-level anyway\nHANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk\nDiary Of A Fresher aged 18 3/4\nSaw Dorothy getting a jacket potato during a revision break, she\u2019s on crutches now and has\nan eye patch, but she looks good.\nIf I sleep for two hours I should be able to get up at 5am then revise another four\nlectures. I have a plan, it should be fine.\nTuesday 13th of January\nOverslept and was nearly late to my exam. It was a disaster. I ran to campus and got there\nsweaty and out of breath, then spent the first twenty minutes trying to calm down before\nasking for some water.\nSo embarrassing. I also could only answer like one question but I waited long enough so it\nwould appear I had just bossed it by leaving early, although now I am like what if I fail and\ndon\u2019t get back in. Maybe the next one will go well?\nMight google UCAS final deadlines just in case\nWednesday 14th of January\nJust missed UCAS final deadline\nBeen in library for about eight hours and literally did nothing. I think I was staring at some\npoint on the wall for around 2 hours before snapping out of my daydream and realising that\nmaybe I am fucking thick and university was way too ambitious. maybe I could do a BTEC or\nsomething?\nThursday 15th of January\nSecond exam. Went just as bad. Want to cry. Now very drunk at the union and saw Kris\nCaye on the screen and just bawled and bawled and bawled. Am now crawled up in a ball\nscrolling through our old whatsapp messages.\nHall mates are knocking on the door asking if I want more sambuka but I think I will literally\nbe this sad forever.

Biased because\nI love Charlie Brooker, biased\nbecause I want to be Charlie Brooker,\nbiased because I enjoyed the first two\nseasons of Black Mirror so much that\nit would physically pain me to have to\ncriticise it.\nLuckily, there is no need to lie.\nWe\u2019ve seen what Christmas is\nlike in the head of this great \u2013 if\nquite abrasive \u2013 man, and it is evil\nand wonderful. Not only was the\nChristmas Special as brilliant and\nsubtle as the rest of the show, it\nalso starred a very special main\ncharacter: Jon Hamm, of Mad Men\nfame. Since whenever Don Draper\nenters the scene one can\u2019t avoid being\ntransfixed, it is no surprise that the\ncombination worked.\nBrooker decides to take a stab at\nsocial media (shocking) by creating a\nsociety where people can be blocked\nin real life and prevented from\ninteracting with others; a simple idea,\nwith harrowing consequences.\nHis is a world where a person\u2019s\nbrain can be exploited to discover\ntheir habits and secrets. A world\nwhere eyes that show everyone what\nwe are looking at exist and where\nmini-copies of our identities act as\nslaves for their larger owners.\nEven so, it is not a futuristic world.\nTechnology doesn\u2019t look foreign\nand alien. It is a reality like today\u2019s,\nwith products surprisingly similar to\nApple iPhones, and where something\nhas gone terribly wrong.\nNormal people are put through\nmental torture by a society that has\nsimply grown too big for its boots.\nJoe (Rafe Spall), who \u2013 if you hadn\u2019t\nguessed from his name \u2013 is an\neveryday guy, has few worries in life.\nHappy enough in a stable, if boring,\nrelationship, he drinks too much and\nenjoys karaoke and taking stupid\nselfies. Sounds familiar? However\nJoe\u2019s life becomes a nightmare when\nhis girlfriend harshly blocks him,\ndragging him through an emotional\nspiral of rage and desperation which\neventually comes to a climax in a\nterrible event.\nHis story is narrated through a\nconversation with a dark, and frankly\ndodgy, companion (Jon Hamm) while\nthe two share a lonely Christmas\nmeal in a far away hut. Since there\nis nothing more introspective than\na desolate hut, Joe reveals way too\nmuch, while we learn few, disturbing\nelements of the other character\u2019s life.\nThis adds a great veil of mystery to\nHamm, who obviously wasn\u2019t sexy\nenough to start with.\nWhether it was meant to provoke\nor entertain, I must say that Black\nMirror: White Christmas definitely\nstruck a chord. Maybe I spend too\nmuch time Facebook stalking? Maybe\nI read too many \u201cTop 10 Celebrity\u201d\nBuzzfeed articles? Maybe I form too\nmany of my opinions from trending\nhashtags? I guess once again, Charlie\nBrooker has served his purpose. His\nlatest work is a masterpiece, or at least\na thoroughly entertaining choice.\nRafe Spall, an admirable performance, despite not being Jon Hamm. Photo: Channel 4\n\n"

Photo: Eli Fosl\n\u201cI began to\nrealise that\nenduring\nhomesickness\nwas not\nas good as\nadjusting and\ncoping with\nit.\u201d\nAs this is the second term for\nthe Welfare section, let\u2019s start\nthings in a different direction!\nAs an International student myself,\nI\u2019m going to talk about what it\u2019s like\nto come study abroad and how I\nlearned to cope with it. England is a\nstrange place to live in and while the\nexperience can be exhilarating, it can\nalso result in major homesickness.\nFor those of you who\u2019d never\nbeen away from your home country\nbefore coming to University, the\nsecond term might start with pangs\nof homesickness, especially if you\u2019ve\ngone home for Christmas and New\nYear surrounded by old friends and\nfamily.\nThis is completely understandable.\nI\u2019ve been studying in England for\nnine years now and I still find myself\nmissing my warm home and the local\ncuisine in the first week of coming\nback here.\nBut let me tell you from experience\nthat it does get better and easier.\nThough sometimes a certain shift in\nperspective will help you get there\nfaster. I\u2019ll share my experience so\nyou\u2019ll see what I mean.\nI came to study in a boarding school\nhere when I was thirteen years old\nand that was probably the biggest\nchange in my life at that point. I\nwas pretty attached to my home in\nPhuket, Thailand then, never leaving\nhome for more than a few weeks at a\ntime. So when I have to move to an\nall-boys boarding school where the\nmajority of students are British, I call\nthat a bit of a culture shock.\nI was immediately homesick. I\nwanted to go back to somewhere I\ncan speak without an accent and\nnot be constantly greeted by \u201cSo\nwhere are you from again?\u201d or\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Thailand on the map?\u201d.\nNot to mention how I was always the\nsmallest boy in every class when I was\naverage height back at home.\nHaving moved from tropical\nThailand, British weather is another\nkind of shock. At first enjoyed the\nway steam came out of my mouth\nwhen I spoke, but I soon missed the\nboiling sun and rains that didn\u2019t last\nfor days. I even missed the very air\nin Thailand since the dry British air\nreally irritated my skin.\nI did not cope well at all in my first\nyear abroad. I actually shut myself\nin instead of trying to adapt to my\nnew environment, burying myself\nbeneath books, games and piles of\ninternational call bills.\nLuckily there was another Thai boy\nwho was having a first year abroad\nlike me, so I ended up socialising only\nwith him. It did not take long for my\nBritish classmates to dismiss me as\n\u201cthat quiet Asian nerd\u201d and forget\nabout me.\nInitially, I preferred that to the\nconstant attention I got from being\ndifferent. But in my second year, I\nbegan to ask about what I was even\ndoing in England.\nOf course, I still think a lot about\nwhen I\u2019m next going home, but\nI began to realize that enduring\nhomesickness was not as good as\nadjusting and coping with it.\nI knew I would be in England until\nthe end of high school at least, so I\nshould do something about being\nhomesick every moment I spend here.\nThat was when I began to do\nstuff outside of regular classes.\nUnfortunately, there were only a few\nThai students in my high school so I\ndidn\u2019t get to join up with them, but I\ndid talk to British students and tried\nto make friends (albeit much later\nthan everyone else).\nAt first, it was awkward as hell, but\nI was slowly overtaken by curiosity\nand the interactions became more\ngenuine. Before I knew it, I began\nto have friends and a sense that I\nbelonged there.\nThen, after every holiday, on my\nflights back to England, I found that\nthe best cure to homesickness is to\nhave something to look forward to\nin the place far away from home. In\na sense, I feel that it\u2019s about making\nthat place your new home with a new\ngroup of friends and activities or\nsocieties you can do there to make\nyou feel that you belong there.\nThe most difficult part that led me\nto snap out of homesickness was the\nshift in attitude from \u201cOh please let\nme go home because this place will\nnever be home\u201d to \u201cThis is not home,\nbut I\u2019m stuck here so might as well try\nmake it one.\u201d\nThis is not a conscious switch and\nit\u2019s not easy (took me a whole year)\nbut I think it\u2019s an essential first step\nto deal with homesickness.\nI should add that there are many\nways to go about it: becoming sociable\nor pushing yourself out of your\ncomfort zone doesn\u2019t have to be a\nscary prospect. Find a community\nor club where you fit in comfortably\nand join that. This can be a hobby\nor a group of people from your own\ncountry. It would go miles towards\nmaking you feel that you belong here.\nGranted, it would be good to try\nsomething new and go out of your\ncomfort zone, but for most people\nthat\u2019s the second step. The first is to\nactually settle in somewhere they\u2019ve\nnever been before and make it\npossible to live there.\nDealing with homesickness is a\npart of that first step. And once that\u2019s\ndone and you\u2019re feeling ready, the\njoy of trying out new things in a new\ncountry will begin in full force.\nIf you\u2019re homesick now, don\u2019t\nworry. The fun will start as soon as\nyou\u2019ve made this new place home!\n\u201cThe most\ndifficult\npart that\nled me to\ncoping with\nhomesickness\nwas the shift\nin attitude.\u201d\nChanon Wongsatayanont shares his first experience living away from home\n\n"

    "content": "24 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n16.01.2015\nArts Editors Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFred Fyles heads down to\nthe Whitechapel Gallery\nas they take an abstract\nadventure through the ages.\nBlack\nSquares: A\nCentury of\nCelebration,\nTriumph,\nand Tears\nIt\u2019s not really a square. That\u2019s\nmy first impression when faced\nwith Black Square, the Kazimir\nMalevich work from 1915 that starts\noff the Whitechapel Gallery\u2019s\nretrospective of abstract art. It\u2019s more\nlike a slightly squished rectangle, and\nafter all the hype, it\u2019s actually pretty\nsmall. However, its size belies the\nhuge impact that this little artistic\ngesture has had on modern society;\nover the last hundred years the\nblack square has gambolled through\nEurope, zipped along the highways\nof America, and spread its influence\nacross the entire globe. The title of\nthe exhibition \u2013 The Adventures of the\nBlack Square \u2013 is therefore fitting; we\nare invited to join this unassuming\ncanvas as it charts a novel path into a\nbright, uncertain future.\nWe begin with four key artists,\nwho were producing work in the\n1910s and 20s, introducing us to\nthe main themes running through\nthis retrospective; Lyubov Popova,\nthe Soviet constructivist whose\nwork represents the intersection\nbetween abstract art and the built\nenvironment, catchily termed\nArchitectonics; Gustav Klutsis\u2019\nabstracted illustrations of\nloudspeakers, influenced by the\nincreasingly complex world of\ncommunication; Sophie TaeuberArp, whose textile work reveals\nthe innumerable ways abstract art\ninfiltrated everyday life; and finally\nKazimir Malevich, whose black\nsquare became a null void, sweeping\naway the conventions of art history,\nmaking way for a new vision of a\nmodern utopia.\nEven within these four works,\na myriad of themes emerge, all of\nwhich are explored throughout\nthe exhibition. The curators have\nmade sure not to place one type of\nwork above the other, and there is\nno hierarchy of medium; thus Anni\nAlbers\u2019 geometric textile work,\nrepresenting the pinnacle of Bauhaus\narts, sit happily alongside Lebanese\nmodernist Saloua Raouda Choucair\u2019s\nrarely seen sculptures, which face\na wall of Alexander Rodchenko\u2019s\ndramatic photography. The works\nmay seem disparate when seen apart,\nbut the Whitechapel manages to show\nthat all have been touched by the\nmagic of Malevich\u2019s utopian ideals.\nThis huge range of material is best\nshown by the work of the American\nabstract artists working in New York\nin the 1960s: Dan Flavin\u2019s neon\npiece \u2018Monument\u2019 for V Tatlin can be\nviewed whilst walking over the giant\nlead blocks of Carl Andre\u2019s 10 x 10\nAltstadt Lead Square. Steel and neon.\nLead and glass. This celebration of\nmodernity is a direct descendent of\nearly abstract photographers like\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy and Alexander\nRodchenko, whose dynamic images\nof pylons, typewriters, and machinery\ntransform mechanisation into an\naesthetic virtue. It also forms a\ncounterpoint to those who feel that\nabstraction is all about objectivity\nand coldness; Flavin and Andre are\nfollowing in the footsteps of early\nconstructivists like Vladimir Tatlin,\nfor whom materiality and non-objectivity were the focal points of\nmodernism.\nThe key historical marker from\nwhich Whitechapel take their cue is\nPetrograd\u2019s 0.10 exhibition of 1915,\nin which ten key artists displayed\ntheir vision of the future, among\nthem Malevich, Popova, and Tatlin.\nThis started a boom of abstract\nart that would spread around\nthe world like wildfire. With the\nmovement\u2019s emphasis on objectivity\nand abstraction, a new means of\ncommunication was formed through\nthe use of manifestos and artistic\npublications, a huge number of which\nare on display here.\nUnlike some other exhibitions,\nthese are not useful for mere\nhistorical reference, but are works\nof art in themselves, exemplifying\nthe modernist emphasis on graphic\ndesign and typography that came to\na head with Moholy-Nagy\u2019s work on\n\u2018typophotos\u2019. The space left behind\nby cutting out all unnecessary detail,\nleaving behind only line and colour,\nhas been filled with ideas, texts, and\ndebate, creating a new visual lexicon\nof artistic theory.\nThese ideas were not only spread\nthrough texts, but also through\nteaching, a process which is captured\nbeautifully by the gallery; the first\narea of teaching we encounter is the\nBauhaus, that veritable behemoth of\nearly modernism. As fascism became\nmore and more powerful, artists such\nas Anni and Josef Albers moved to\nNew York, where they taught students\nfrom all over the world. Thus we have\nexposure to a whole globe of artists,\nshattering the myth that abstraction\nwas solely a Western phenomenon;\nfrom Argentina we have Tom\u00e1s\nMaldonado\u2019s bright minimalism;\nfrom Israel come Zvi Goldstein\u2019s\ntableaus inspired by the iconography\nof communication; and from Iran we\n\"Over\nthe last\n100 years\nthe black\nsquare has\ngambolled\nthrough\nEurope.\"\nBlack and White.

Photo: imgkid.com\nJames Bezer on Imperial research that could improve diagnosis and save lives\nShark gives birth on camera\nJAMES BEZER\nSCIENCE EDITOR\n\"This will be\nextremely\nvaluable\nfor correct\nfuture\ndiagnosis\nand\ntreatment.\"\nGenetic mutations that lie\nbehind a common type of\nheart disease have been\nidentified by researchers at Imperial,\nlaying the foundations for better\ntreatments and more accurate\ndiagnosis of a serious and often fatal\ncondition.\nDilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is\na degenerative disorder that causes\nthe heart to become enlarged and\nunable to beat properly, often leading\nto heart failure and sudden death. It\nis believed to affect about 1 in 250\npeople, and causes over 10,000 deaths\nevery year in the US.\nUnlike the most common form\nof heart disease, which is caused by\nnarrowing of the coronary arteries\ndue to a build-up of cholesterol, DCM\nis often hereditary and typically\naffects younger people, with most\nsufferers aged between 20 and 60.\nIt has historically had a very poor\nprognosis, although new drugs and\nother treatments have improved\npatient outcomes in the last 10 years.\nIn many people with DCM, a key\nprotein in heart muscle called titin is\nshorter than it should be. Mutations\nin the gene that codes for titin are\nvery common, causing shortening\nof the protein in about 2% of the\npopulation. The vast majority of\npeople with shortened titin have no\nsymptoms of DCM. The reason for\nthis difference is unknown.\nTitin is also an extremely large\nprotein, more than a micrometre in\nlength, made up of almost 35,000\namino acids. These factors have\nmade it difficult to identify harmful\nmutations and establish a genetic test\nfor the condition.\nScientists at Imperial and the Royal\nBrompton hospital sequenced the\ngene in 5000 people, and determined\nthe location of mutations in the\ngenes of healthy patients and those\nwith DCM. This data enabled them\nto identify exactly which types of\nmutation are harmful and which are\nnot.\nThe study, published in the journal\nScience Translational Medicine, could\nallow relatives of sufferers to find\nout if they too will develop DCM,\nassisting earlier diagnosis and\nimproving treatment outcomes.\nAccording to Professor Jeremy\nPearson, Associate Medical Director\nat the British Heart Foundation,\n\u201cThis study defines, for the first\ntime, a comprehensive list of\nmutations in the titin gene, which\nof these are associated with dilated\ncardiomyopathy, and which are\nharmless. This information will be\nextremely valuable for correct future\ndiagnosis and treatment as we enter\nan era when many people\u2019s genes will\nbe sequenced\u201d.\nDOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3010134\nAthresher shark has been\nrecorded giving birth in\nthe wild for the first time.\nThe photograph was taken in\n2013 by marine biologists from\nthe University of Chester on an\nexpedition to Monad Shoal in the\nPhilippines.\nThe researchers were observing the\nshark at cleaning station, where small\ncreatures such as shrimp remove\nparasites from the bodies of larger\nanimals. They noticed that she was\nbecoming agitated but didn\u2019t realise\nwhy until they analysed the data.\nThe remarkable photo shows\na pup emerging from the shark\u2019s\ncloaca.

New Years\u2019\nResolution? Who has time for that!\nHowever, whether you had time to jot\na list that you vow to adhere to for the\nrestoftheyear;ormerelyre-wrotethe\none from last year,here\u2019s some reason\nas to why traveling should be on your\nlist!\n1) Student/Youth discount\nThat\u2019s something every student\nshould be familiar with. Your student\ncard is actually worth more than you\nthink. You get discounted tickets or\neven free entries to major sites and\nmuseums. I saved thirty euros alone\nwhen I was in Athens.\n2) It is an experience like no other\nThismightsoundcheesy,buttraveling\nis one of the few things you can buy\nthat would make you richer. It will\nopenyoureyestoawholenewculture,\nwidening your horizon. It also gives\nDespite the chills and long nights,\nthere\u2019s something amazing about\nEurope during December, when\nthe festive spirit of Christmas is at\nits highest. One such destination\nis Prague, who, with its medieval\ncobbles stone streets and squares\nflocked with wooden stalls, will get\nyou into the joyful holiday mood in\nno time. The Czechs have spared no\nexpense, putting up lavish Christmas\nlightings virtually everywhere, and\nalmost every square spots a Christmas\ntree. Unless you live under a rock, it\u2019s\nnear impossible not to notice that\nChristmas is near.\nThe main Christmas market is\nat the Old Town Square, with an\nimpressive backdrop of churches,\npalace and historical houses. Every\neffort was made to bring Christmas\nto the Old Square; with a towering\nChristmas tree beaming like a beacon,\nbrimming with all manners of lights\nand baubles. A stepped stand allowing\ntourists and locals alike to climb up\nand admire the views on a vantage\npoint, there is even a petting zoo for\nchildren on one side of the square.\nThe surrounding trees and green\nspace is filled with lights of all kind;\nangels blowing trumpets to sheep and\nthree wise men. If you want a better\nview of the whole square, you can\nclimb up the astronomical clocktower\nadjacent to the square and tour the\nheritage site.\nA mere five minutes\u2019 walk away\nis the Wenceslas Square. Spanning\nacross several blocks, it hosts two\nmarkets on either end. Though stands\nare fewer in number, and decorations\nless extravagant, a smaller Christmas\ntree and a novelty stand were present\nin area.\nHere\u2019s where I introduce you to\nthe two best buds that will keep your\nenergy and temperature up: Svarak\nand Trdelnik. Whilst they might\nsound exotic, Svarak is actually just\ntraditional Czech mulled wine, and\nTrdelnik is a Transylvanian snack\nconsisting of a roll roasted on a bit\nand dredged through cinnamon and\nnuts. Traditional hams, sausages and\nfried potatoes are amongst the other\nfood stuff you will find dotted across\nthe markets. In terms of shopping,\nstalls usually sell souvenir, winter\naccessories or Christmas decoration.\nWooden figurines, baubles, lace\ncutwork or the typical magnets,\nmost stalls sell very similar, tourist\ntargeted items. If you are looking\nfor more than just the usual tourist\nhideouts, try the Christmas Markets\nat Namesti Miru (Namesti means\nsquare) in district two.\nAside from the Christmas markets\nand decorations, the cold, wintery\ntimes brings out a different side to\nthe sights, too. Head to Charles Bridge\nafter dark (which shouldn\u2019t be that\nhard at all), where the fog will descend\ngiving the medieval bridge a sinister\nvibe. You might argue that you can\nsee the bridge in the summer during\nnight time, too. However it would\nnever feel the same as when you see\nit in the cold, dark night of winter.\nLegend has it that the statues of the\nbridge come alive during the night\nand roam the city, and it\u2019s not hard at\nall to imagine the weathered figures\nstepping down from their centuries-old place and stretching their stone\nlimbs like a scene out of Night at the\nMuseum.\nThe gloomy Charles Bridge at night Photo: Yung Wing Cheah\nFrom top left clockwise: a view of Prague from Castle district; Santorini donkey riding; famous shipwreck\nbay on the island of Zakynthos Photo: Yung Wing Cheah and Yung Nam Cheah\nyou a break from the gloomy weather\nof London.\n3) Time\nBelieve it or not, you are never going\nto be more free, or more free of\nresponsibility in your life. You can\ngo wherever you want to whenever\nyou want to (providing you don\u2019t run\nout of cash or miss too many classes)\nwithouthavingtoexplaintoyourboss\nwhy you suddenly need an extra week\noff.\n4) You can endure the hardship\nThis might sound a bit dodgy, but\ntrust me, as you grow older you get\nmore picky and fussy. You don\u2019t want\nto stay at a cheap hostel, you want\nyour own room so you can have some\nprivacy, or you can\u2019t walk as much, or\nstand cramping on a tiny seat for ten\nhours.\n5) Because the world is beautiful\nYUNG NAM CHEAH\n\n"

Within\nhalf an hour, twelve people had been\nshot dead, including the editor of\nthe magazine, two policemen and\nseveral cartoonists that had drawn the\n\u201cblasphemous\u201d and controversial front\ncovers.\nThe gunmen, identified as brothers\nSaid and Cherif Kouachi, remained\non the run for a further two days,\neventually holing themselves up\nin an industrial warehouse, before\nbeing shot dead by policemen\nstorming the site. Another gunman,\noperating in the South of France, was\nalso shot dead the same day, after\nholding shoppers hostage at a kosher\nsupermarket.\nFour of the hostages were also\nkilled, marking the end of three days\nof terror that has been said to be\nthe worst France has experienced in\ndecades.\nAs it all unfolded live through social\nmedia and the news, people wanted\nto discuss little else. #JeSuisCharlie,\na hashtag used to express solidarity\nwith the publication was tweeted\nover five million times. It remained\ntrending on twitter in London for\nthe next two days as people discussed\nthe attack, shared the cartoons that\nwere found so offensive and talked\nabout what this said about the right\n(or privilege, as some would argue) of\nfree speech.\nThat evening people flocked to\nTrafalgar Square in their hundreds,\nsinging La Marseillaise, France\u2019s\nnational anthem and holding up pens,\npencils and in the case of one person,\nan apple keyboard. The elevation of a\npen became a symbol of support for\nthe publication, a trend that swept\nEurope and was seen at the many\nother rallies that gathered throughout\nthe evening.\nThe Guardian put together an\nimpromptu #GuardianLive panel\ndiscussion for the following evening,\nwith journalists and cartoonists\nalike coming together to discuss\nthe events. They also discussed the\nimplications the attack could have\non writers, small magazines right up\nthe national press across the country.\nFelix went along to follow the\ndebate, and listened as people spoke\nof free speech, the role of comics in\nnewspapers and just what the point of\na cartoon is.\nThey also discussed at length just\nwhat people could do to support\nthe magazine. With many online\nposting the incriminating cartoons,\nnewspapers were loath to follow suit.\nMany preferred to illustrate their\nfront covers with an image of one of\nthe policemen being shot, over the\nline drawings depicting the Prophet\nMohammad.\nEditors present cited that they were\nadhering to editorial policies that\nprohibit portrayals of the Prophet.\nOthers suggested that those who are\nresponsible for smaller publications\nshould not make a decision that\ncould also put their editorial team\nin danger. This was eerily prophetic:\nlast Sunday, Hamberger Morgenpost,\na German newspaper, suffered from\nan Arson attack after reprinting the\ncartoon. No-one was injured but\ntwo people have been arrested on\nsuspicion of carrying out the attack.\nSome said sharing the \u201cinsulting\u201d\ncartoons doesn\u2019t do any favours,\nbut instead people should take out\nsubscriptions to the magazine, or\ndonate money. Alan Rusbridger,\nEditor in Chief of the Guardian,\nannounced that the Guardian\nMedia Group has pledged \u00a3100,000\nto support Charlie Hebdo, an\ndeclaration that was greeted with a\nround of applause.\nSunny Hundal, one of the\njournalists on the panel, summed up\nthat free speech is a two way street:\n\u201c Why is it so difficult for liberals to\npersuade Muslims that free speech\nis also for them? Free speech is\nimportant for both those who wish to\ncriticise religion and those who wish\nto practise religion too.\u201d\nHowever, others were quick to\npoint out there is a thin line between\nsatire and blasphemy, although who\ndetermines where this line is drawn\nis also a contentious issue. The debate\nwas impassioned, eye opening and\ninformative: a silver lining of the\notherwise dark cloud that had settled\nover journalism in the previous 24\nhours.\nThat\u2019s not to say everyone has\nbeen supporting of the magazine. A\ncoffee shop owner in Brick Lane has\nfaced death threats over their \u201cJe suis\nCharlie\u201d sign outside their caf\u00e9. Adel\nDefilaux, a French-born Muslim,\nwas confronted by an intruder\ndemanding he remove the sign,\nstating that the cartoonists \u201cdeserved\nto die for what they did.\u201d\nPolice are now investigating the\nmatter, but Defilaux has not let this\ndeter him from showing his support\nfor the magazine. \u201cI feel weak by\nmyself with my little caf\u00e9 trying to\nfight against him but I won\u2019t let him\ndo what he wants. I\u2019m a Muslim like\nhim and if I want to support Charlie\nHebdo I will do it. I don\u2019t want to let\nhim win.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Trafalgar Square played\nhost to a Unity Rally attended by\nthe French Ambassador for the UK,\nSylvie Bermann. Trafalgar Square,\nThe National Gallery the London\nEye and the Tower Bridge were also\nilluminated by the colours of the\nFrench flag.\nCraig Buchanan, an Imperial\nTrafalgar square played host to the vigils in the city, with the National Gallery being draped in red, white and blue. Photo:\nPostgraduate, went along and told\nFelix what it was like to be part of\nthe rally: \u201cThere was quite a sombre\natmosphere with some people holding\ncandles and others signs with \u201cJe suis\nCharlie\u201d on.\n\u201cOne corner of Trafalgar Square\nwas closed off for the media satellite\nvans, with the reporters going around\ninterviewing people. In front of the\nNational Gallery was a quite moving\ncollection of flowers, posters and\npens.\n\u201cThere was quite a crowd of\npeople surrounding the display, and\noccasionally someone would step\nforward and light a candle or drop\noff a pen or pencil. It was also quite\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 31\nFELIX 16.01.2015\nTravel Editor Yung Nam Cheah\nTravel\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nChris Richardson shares his how-to guide for living and volunteering in the \u2018Big Durian\u2019\nVolunteer experience: my month with\nYBS in Jakarta\nIspent a few weeks working with\nthe Foundation for Mother and\nChild Health \u2013 Yayasan Balita\nSehat (YBS) \u2013 in Jakarta, and thought\nI\u2019d share my experience with any\nwould-be volunteers out there. Jakarta\nis a destination that most avoid\nlike the plague, but I think that for\nseasoned Londoners the downsides\n(traffic and crime risk) are tame at\nbest and offset by the benefits: I met\nsome brilliant people, did some cool\nstuff, and in general had a great time.\nIt was a solid experience, being in an\ninteresting place and working for a\nuseful cause.\nWorking at YBS\nYBS is an NGO focusing on mother\nand child health. They\u2019re based\nin a small office in Cipete, South\nJakarta. As it\u2019s a relatively small\nteam, you\u2019ll quickly get to know\nnames and faces, and everyone is\nextremely accommodating. Based\non your experience and interests, the\nteam will make sure your project is\ninteresting, enjoyable, and useful.\nAnd they\u2019ll be sure to put your nerdy\nImperial skills to good use.\nThe main focus of my time was\nto run a project on social impact\nmeasurement, looking at the three\nmain programmes at YBS in order\nto assess their effectiveness. This\nwill be useful for YBS to work as\nsuccessfully as possible, and also\nallow them to better showcase their\nwork to sponsors. I developed this\nproject from the initial research and\ndesigning the study, through to data\ncollection and analysis, responsibility\nI doubt I\u2019d have been given at a\nlarger organisation. The team were\nincredibly helpful throughout the\nprocess, especially when translating\nfrom English to Indonesian, and\ninterviewing the mothers invited to\nparticipate in the study.\nThere are also plenty of\nopportunities to get involved with\nas much as you\u2019d like alongside your\nmain project. Whilst there I went out\non site to visit beneficiaries in their\nhomes, as well as visiting a factory\noutside of Jakarta to see a health\neducation session in action. I also ran\na couple of smaller projects on the\nside but, most importantly, had fun\nspending time with the children who\ncome to the pre-school every morning\n\u2013 a much more fulfilling break than\nthe trivial water cooler chat I\u2019ve\nencountered at other offices.\nGiven that work fills so much of\nyour day, it\u2019s important that you\nenjoy what you do. I loved working\non my project, and have no doubts\nthat subsequent volunteers will have\nsimilar positive experiences.\nLiving in Jakarta\nI tend to be an open-minded guy\nwhen it comes to travel destinations.\nBut everyone I spoke to on the road\ntold me some variation of \u201cdon\u2019t\nbother with Jakarta\u201d. Twin that\nwith the city\u2019s nickname \u2013 the Big\nDurian \u2013 and you\u2019re left with some\npretty low expectations. But, perhaps\nunsurprisingly, I was pleasantly\nsurprised. As a tourist, sure, there\u2019s\nvery little for you here, unless you\u2019re\na big fan of sightseeing. But once\nyou\u2019re rooted here for more than a\nfew days, Jakarta starts to get well and\ntruly into your veins. Let\u2019s quickly\ncover the basics:\nAccommodation: YBS were\nextremely helpful in helping me to\nsecure a spare room just two minutes\u2019\nwalk from the office, at $125 (US)\nfor the month (yes, month). For\nthat I got a spacious room with a\ndouble bed, en-suite bathroom, and\nair conditioning. Mr Halimah and\nhis family were lovely and ensured\nmy stay was comfortable. There\nare countless host families in the\nneighbourhood \u2013 just a stone\u2019s\nthrow from popular expat hangout\nKemang \u2013 and all the other amenities\n(supermarkets, laundry services,\nmalls) you could need within a fifteen\nminute walk or two minute cab. If\nyou\u2019d rather opt for something else,\nthere\u2019s always CouchSurfing, which\nwe\u2019ll come to now.\nSocial scene: As soon as you arrive,\nget onto CouchSurfing and have a look\nfor events in Jakarta. At the time\nof writing, there\u2019s a hugely popular\nWednesday pub quiz held at de Hooi\nin Pondok Indah, with a perfect\nblend of locals and expats to keep you\nentertained. I went in my first week\nand never looked back. From that\ninitial evening out I made some great\nfriends and had invitations to more\nsocial events than I could attend: a\nweekly indie movie night, a weekly\nSunday fun run, and various one-offs.\nMy top 3 times are probably catching\na decent DJ from the top floor of a\nskyscraper overlooking the city, a\nweekend snorkelling trip away to the\nThousand Islands, and a tour of the\nGoogle offices. I cannot stress enough\njust how easy CouchSurfing will make\nyour social life in Jakarta.\nTransportation: I\u2019ll admit that I\nnever got around to taking a local bus.\nBut that\u2019s because the taxis and ojek\n(motorcycle taxis) are so cheap. For\ntaxis, you\u2019ll want to aim for either\na Blue Bird or Express (2 reliable\ncompanies), and expect to pay $1 (5\nminute) to $5 (1 hour) \u2013 just wait on\nthe street and flag one down. Ojek\nshould be easily spotted by their\nsignposts, but if you\u2019re stuck just ask\nthe nearest local and they\u2019ll point you\nin the right direction \u2013 remember to\nask a friend roughly what to pay, and\nnegotiate the price with the driver\nChildren gathering for story time. Photo: Chris Richardson\n\"YBS is\na cause\nworth\nbeing a\npart of.\"\n\"Jakarta\nis a\nhappening\ncity....\"\nbefore you hop on. In general, taxis\nare nicer for longer journeys or if\nthere\u2019s rain brewing. Ojek, on the\nother hand, are perfect during rush\nhour, as they can weave through the\ncars and get you to your destination\nin a fraction of the time.\nFood: Jakarta caters for all price\nbrackets \u2013 from $0.50 street snacks\nthrough to decent restaurants that\u2019ll\nstill set you back less than $10\nfor a main. I got into the habit of\nstocking up on breakfast from the\nsupermarket, grabbing lunch from\na nearby local restaurant ($1), and\nthen heading out with friends for\ndinner in the evening. There are so\nmany dishes to try: nasi goreng (fried\nrice), rendang padang (beef curry),\nand sate (grilled meat skewers) will\nbecome your staples, always served\nalongside a hearty dollop of fiery\nsambal (chilli sauce). But there\u2019s also\nthe multinational names you see\neverywhere, but at a fraction of the\ncost you\u2019re probably used to \u2013 a large\nDomino\u2019s pizza will set you back\nabout $3.50.\nSo I think that just about covers\nit. Overall I loved my project at YBS\nand made some brilliant friends in\nJakarta who I hope to keep in contact\nwith for a long time. The experience\nwas a fantastic one that I would\nrecommend to anybody: Jakarta is\na happening city and YBS is a cause\nworth being a part of. Use the above\nas a guideline, but I\u2019m sure if you\nstitch together various sources with\nsome information on the ground,\nyou\u2019ll find the perfect blend of things\nto keep you entertained.\nTo find out more about YBS, visit\nfmch-indonesia.org or contact the\nEditor.\nNothing makes your day more than making someone\nhappy.

Her raw, uncompromising,\nuninhibited performance is without\ndoubt the best thing she has done in\nyears, and her production company\nsecuring the rights to produce Cheryl\nStrayed\u2019s autobiography was a smart\nmove, as evidenced by the accolades\nshe has been receiving lately. It is\nWitherspoon\u2019s very own Eat Pray\nLove, but unlike Julia Roberts\u2019\ncringeworthy, self-indulgent vom-fest\nof a film, this one feels truly personal.\nAfter several personal setbacks,\nStrayed (Witherspoon) spirals\nviolently out of control, ending up in\na drug-fuelled, sex-filled mess. Hitting\nrock bottom kick-starts her decision\nto do something about and with her\nlife, and that leads to her embarking\non a solo trek across the Pacific Crest\nTrail. She is not trying to set a record\nfor herself, nor is she doing this for\nany other incentive than to find\nherself, to heal, and to go back to what\nonce was a peaceful, grounded life.\nFrom the get-go the trek poses\ngreat challenges. Seeing the petite\nWitherspoon struggle with her\nweighty travelling backpack\noffers some laughs, as do her self-deprecating narrative remarks that\nremind her that this may not have\nbeen such a good idea. She has the\nwrong gas canister so ends up not\nbeing able to cook, pitching a tent\nturns out to be harder than it looks,\nand walking for miles and miles\nunder the sun takes a toll on her\nfeet, her toenails (a rather graphic\nbut necessary scene focuses on this\naspect), and her stamina overall.\nBeautifully edited together to show\nher present time at the Trail, as well\nas weaving together relevant scenes\nfrom her past that led up to this point,\nyou quickly get the overall picture\nas to where it all went wrong in the\nfirst place. Strayed\u2019s mother Bobbi\n(Laura Dern) plays a big part in the\nflashbacks, and yes, it does appear to\nbe a slightly odd casting decision to\nhave someone who is only nine years\nolder than Witherspoon to play her\nmother. But Dern is so wonderfully\nwarm and maternal that the age gap\nhardly seems to matter in the end,\nand the two actresses work so well\ntogether to create a touching mother-daughter connection.\nThey share particularly a tender\nmoment in which Dern\u2019s character\nwisely guides her daughter to be\nappreciative of all the positive\nthings left in her life, even in the\nmost challenging situations. Cheryl\nnaturally rolls her eyes and dismisses\nher corny mother, but it is a small,\nstandout moment in a film that is full\nof these little gems.\nThis is Witherspoon like you have\nnever seen her before. She has two\ntimelines to juggle essentially and is\nwonderful in every minute and frame\nof the film. Her struggles along the\nTrail, the wilderness she encounters as\nwell as some particularly unsavoury\ncharacters she comes across, make\nthe end result all the more inspiring,\nwhilst also sporadically throwing\nin the eventual near breakdown\nin her past heightens the sense of\nachievement. Just how far she has\ncome as a person when the film closes,\nshould serve as an inspiration for\nus all, to always live your life to the\nfullest.\nInto the wild without delay\nPhoto: Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, Fox Searchlight Pictures\nWHIPLASH\nDirector: Damien Chazelle\nScreenplay: Damien Chazelle\nCast: Miles Teller, J. K.\nSimmons\nJOSHUA RENKEN\nSECTION WRITER\nAre you a rusher, or are you a dragger?\nPhoto: Damien Chazelle, Bold Films\nWritten and shot by the\nyoung American director\nDamien Chazelle, Whiplash\nis an ambitious piece of storytelling\nthat chronicles the development\nand suffering of a young musician\nwith dreams of becoming one\nof the greatest drummers of his\ngeneration. The film follows Shaffer\nConservatory of Music freshman\nAndrew Nieman (Miles Teller), who\nis handpicked by the demanding\nand much-feared teacher, Terence\nFletcher (J.K. Simmons), to be a\ndrummer in a jazz orchestra created\nfor the competition circuit.\nBald, muscly and always wearing\nblack clothes, Terence Fletcher is\nvolatile and predatory from the\noutset. In his position of power\nFletcher uses intimidation and\nfear tactics to push his jazz band\nto perfection. He uses his students\nas though they themselves are\ninstruments that need to be\nmanipulated to get the sound he\nwants. At times Fletcher\u2019s actions\npush past the point of credibility and\nthe plot in general gradually becomes\nless believable as it builds to a climax.\nUnforgiving barks such as\n\u201calternates, will you clean the blood\noff my drum set?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not going\nto have you cost us a competition\nbecause your mind\u2019s on a fucking\nHappy Meal instead of on pitch\u201d are\ndirected at anyone who isn\u2019t up to\nscratch. His enraged monologues feel\nsimultaneously horrific and darkly\nhumorous.\nFletcher makes no apologies for his\ntough love and is confident that the\nnext great drummer will rise to the\noccasion. He puts a face to the cutthroat world of the performing arts\nand this savage character brings out\na truly unforgettable performance by\nJ.K. Simmons.\nAndrew deals with Fletcher\u2019s\nmental and physical abuse by\nsubjecting himself to days of\nintensive practice in a frantic\nobsession to gain a stronger beat.\nThis makes for one of the most\nemotionally charged montages I\u2019ve\never seen on the big screen. The film\ndetails Andrew\u2019s suffering with an\nalmost pornographic sensibility.\nLingering close-ups of the blood,\nsweat and tears shed during the film\nare used to highlight the pervading\natmosphere of sadomasochism that\nthe central characters inhabit. Few\nfilms maintain such a strong feeling\nof suspense throughout, and Whiplash\nis one of them.\nWith a total running time of just\n106 minutes, the tight editing keeps\nthe audience engaged throughout and\nadds to the impact of the storytelling.\nIn a time where many films are too\nlong and too dumb, Whiplash makes\nfor a refreshingly raw and enigmatic\nwatch.\nHowever, Andrew is too much of a\nblank slate away from his drum kit\nand the film would have benefitted\nby fleshing out his character. The\nrelationship Andrew initiates with\nNicole (Melissa Benoist) near the\nbeginning of the film feels too much\nlike a throwaway subplot. Nicole\nis simply there to provide contrast\nbetween her indecisive outlook on life\nas a mediocre student, and Andrew - a\nrapacious tunnel-visionary.\nTheir brief relationship comes\nacross as a weak attempt to\ndemonstrate the sacrifices Andrew\nfeels he must make under the\ndistressing conclusion that he cannot\nlove and drum at the same time. The\nblunt break-up explanation shows the\nfirst signs that Andrew is beginning to\nsee the method in Fletcher\u2019s madness.\nWhiplash has little to say about the\npractices of the characters it follows,\nexcept for making you wonder, in this\nstruggle for the beau ideal, whether\nthe sacrifice is worth the reward.\nThe title of the film refers to the\nHank Levy song of the same name,\nwhich is played during Andrew\u2019s\naudition. But the title also alludes\nto the break-neck speeds with which\nAndrew\u2019s situation changes, usually\ncoming as a result of his teacher\u2019s\ncalculated exploits. Fletcher\u2019s\nseemingly instantaneous transitions\nbetween periods of neglect and bursts\nof savagery is what makes this film\nso exhilarating and Damian Chazelle\ndoes a fantastic job of captivating\nthe emotional whiplash that Andrew\nexperiences.\nDespite the amount of drumming\nin the film, Whiplash is more of a\nsuspense thriller than a musical\ndrama. Music merely provides a\nbackdrop in this whirlwind exposition\nof an intense mentor prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nrelationship, during which we observe\nAndrew\u2019s metamorphosis from a shy,\nlonely first-year to a musician every\nbit as stubborn as his teacher.\nWhiplash has its faults, but you\ncannot criticise the execution, with\nthrillingly fetishistic cinematography\nthanks to Sharone Meir and a great\nsoundtrack from Justin Hurwitz to\nboot. Critics have gone as far to say\nthat Whiplash is to drumming what\nRaging Bull is to boxing. For a 29-year-old to create such a visceral piece of\ncinema in only his second feature\nlength film on a shoestring budget of\n$3.3 million is simply astounding.\n\n"

Damon Albarn at the Royal\nAlbert Hall (16th\nNovember)\nIn April Damon Albarn, of Blur\nand Gorillaz fame, released his first\nsolo album Everyday Robots. While\nI enjoyed this record, it was not the\neasiest album to just listen to. This\nwas a worry that I had going to this\nconcert; would it just be a lot of solo\nstuff and very few fan-pleasing Blur\nand Gorillaz hits? Luckily, Albarn did\nneither of these. His set contained 25\nsongs in total and only 8 of these were\nfrom the solo album but he included\nall of the best songs from the album\nincluding \u2018Everyday Robots\u2019, \u2018Mr\nTembo\u2019 and \u2018Heavy Seas of Love\u2019.\nHe also played some rarely heard\nand even previously never performed\nBlur and Gorillaz songs such as\nthe B-sides \u2018The Man Who Left\nHimself\u2019 (Blur) and \u2018Spitting Out\nThe Demons\u2019 (Gorillaz), which was\na surprise. Furthermore, there was a\nnice representation of all of Albarn\u2019s\ncareer with his The Good, The Bad and\nThe Queen and Mali Music projects\nrepresented in this set.\nHowever while all of these things\nwere good, it was the guests which\nmade this concert very special and\nwhy it was included in my top five.\nGraham Coxon joined Albarn in\nthe first encore to play some Blur\nsongs, including \u2018Tender\u2019 which\ngot the whole of the Royal Albert\nHall singing. Then in the second\nencore, Kano was the guest for \u2018Clint\nEastwood\u2019 and De La Soul were the\nguests for \u2018Feel Good Inc.\u2019 which lead\nto a massive burst of energy right\nnear the end of the concert. The final\nguest however was definitely the\nmost surprising; Brian Eno. Joining\nAlbarn for \u2018Heavy Seas of Love\u2019, it was\nan extremely special moment and\neven Albarn seemed shocked that it\nwas happening.\n4. Metronomy at Alexandra\nPalace (5th\nDecember)\nMetronomy have fine-tuned their\nshow to be a masterclass in how to\nperform live. Despite not being a\nsell-out show \u2013 likely due to them\nheadlining Field Day and playing a\nhost of other festivals \u2013 Metronomy\nperformed at perhaps their best ever.\nThey played a longer set than\nexpected which featured 23 songs and\ncontained a good mix of their whole\nhistory as a band \u2013 unless you love Pip\nPaine (Pay The \u00a35000 You Owe) which\nonly had one song featured. The band\nhad plenty of charisma (that thing\nLouis Walsh tells everyone on the X\nFactor they have; just to let you know\nnone of them really do).\nThey took hits from The English\nRiviera such as \u2018The Bay\u2019 and \u2018The\nLook\u2019 and took them to the next\nlevel with slightly weird but amazing\ndancing by the band and a light show\nto rival much bigger artists\u2019. They\neven took on the huge Beatles song\n\u2018Here Comes the Sun\u2019 and didn\u2019t just\ngive it justice but made it their own.\nAlso, whilst Love Letters was not\nas strong an album as The English\nRiviera, they made those songs full\nof life which did not occur as well on\nrecord. But the highlight for me was\n\u2018You Could Easily Have Me\u2019 from Pip\nPaine, which turned Alexandra Palace\ninto a massive dance arena. This was\nthe year that Metronomy became\ntruly huge and they are worthy to\nheadline bigger places.\n3. Foals at Alexandra Palace\n(14th\nFebruary)\nFoals, at this point, had headlined\ntheir first major UK festival at\nLatitude the previous summer and\nwere fully ready for challenge of\nAlexandra Palace, which was jam-packed ready to see this Oxford indie\nrock band. They took their extremely\npopular songs and perfected them\nlive; they were extended to just the\nright point with the band in perfect\nunison with each other.\nFoals took songs from their whole\ncareer from \u2018Hummer\u2019, one of their\nfirst singles, to \u2018Providence\u2019 from\nHoly Fire. Their set only contained\n13 songs in total but when the songs\nare played so well it made little\ndifference.\nThe crowd was simply mental;\nmosh pits opened throughout and\ntook the width of Alexandra Palace,\nthey hit the floor like a tribal dance\nand generally sung and danced like\nthere was no tomorrow. The band\nhad a very impressive light show\nparticularly during \u2018Spanish Sahara\u2019\nwith a show more akin to dance music\nconcerts than an indie rock concert.\nHowever, the main highlight was\n\u2018Two Steps Twice\u2019 which is one of the\nbest songs to end a gig; it builds up\nslowly for about eight minutes until\nthe drums really kick in and everyone\nscreams the lyrics and runs into each\nother. I left with a bruise over my face\nbut it was incredible and that lone\nsong cemented them on this list.\n2. Kasabian at Brixton\nAcademy (1st\nDecember)\nKasabian had a huge year in 2014,\nin which they had another number\none album with 48:13, played a\nhuge homecoming show in Victoria\nPark in Leicester and headlined\nthe Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury\nFestival. Finishing the year they went\nto a much smaller venue, Brixton\nAcademy, for a five day residency.\nThere was a huge hype right\nbefore them due to a bright pink\ntimer which counted down until the\nfirst song, \u2018Bumblebeee\u2019 which was\nperformed initially acoustically.\nThe crowd still went for it with all\nof their might singing every word\nas loud as the band could play; this\ngig was definitely the loudest I had\nexperienced at Brixton Academy.\nRandom words such as \u2018two-er\u2019 and\n\u2018flannel\u2019 would appear on the back\nscreen which were likely an in-joke\nby the band. As the gig went on, the\nenergy of the crowd did not wane and\nmosh pits remained a permanent\nfeature of the concert.\nTheir songs featured some snippets\nof other famous songs such as\n\u2018Black Skinhead\u2019 featuring as the\nintroduction for \u2018Shoot the Runner\u2019\nwhich increased the energy of the\ncrowd even more. The best of these\nsnippets was \u2018Word Up\u2019 by Cameo\nduring \u2018Re-Wired\u2019. They did not\nskimp on the new songs either, with\n7 out of 21 songs being from 48:13,\nwhich in my opinion is the best album\nsince their self-titled as a whole.\nThey did not have just the hits in\nthe show either, with rarely played\nsongs such as \u2018Cutt Off\u2019 which made\nThis gig was\ndefinitely\nthe loudest\nI had\nexperienced\nat Brixton\nAcademy!\nThis was the\nyear that\nMetronomy\nbecame truly\nhuge and\nare worthy\nto headline\nbigger places\n\n"

What drives\nthis incandescent prodigy to be the\nbest? Nothing, apparently: \u201cTo be fair,\nI don\u2019t even need to revise. You know\nthose horrifically irritating people\nwho do next to no work, but end up\ntop of the class? They\u2019re entirely\nbelow me.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not all about thoroughly\nundeserved top grades; Sergey has a\nlife too!\nKeen to emphasise his \u201cpatrician\u201d\ntaste in film, he praises recent\nBenedict Cumberbatch hit The\nImitation Game as \u201cthe funniest\ncomedy of the year.\u201d\n\u201cWhat made the humour so on\npoint was the way in which this guy\nkept on struggling and struggling to\nbreak this big code. Clearly, if it was\nreal life, all you\u2019d need is a couple of\nhours with a pencil, some paper, a\nbottle of Cava and some Beethoven\non the radio. God knows I\u2019ve cracked\nharder \u2013 and easier! Like these\nexams.\u201d\nNext up for Sergey? \u201cA\ndepartmental award, obviously. I\u2019m\na modest guy, but my limitless talent\ndeserves the sincerest adoration.\u201c\nIt\u2019s not all fun and games for the\nsavant, conceding that envious rivals\nare always around the corner.\n\u201cThis ingrate who doesn\u2019t even\nhave the vaguest understanding of\nN-terminal myristoylation sites in\nplant proteins said that he wanted to\nbreak my nose last week.\nSo I turned around and told him\nthat I hoped he got hit by a bus \u2013 a\nbus of knowledge and intelligence,\nthat is.\u201d\nAn anonymous student has\nbravely decided to sacrifice\nhis revision time over the\nChristmas holidays to run a Facebook\npage for Imperial students, despite\nhaving three final year exams to\ntackle later on this week.\nThe page, Imperial Humans Tell\nSomeone in the Central Library their\nSecrets about the Fourth Floor, has\nover twenty posts detailing various\nanecdotes, worries and shameful\nsecrets from Imperial students, all\nsubmitted via an anonymous Google\ndoc set up by our hero.\nNot only that, this valiant figure\nhas decided to remain anonymous\ntoo, despite numerous people\ncalling for his identity to be\nrevealed. However, Hangman can\nexclusively announce that this elusive\nengineering student has granted us\nan interview, to really find out what\nmakes this admin tick.\nWe met up with him in the Central\nLibrary caf\u00e9, where he was slunk low\ndown at one of the desks, his black\nNumber of Imperial\nstudents who take the bus\nincreases by 4600%\nThis Tuesday, industrial action\nby the trade union Unite saw a\nhuge upswing in the proportion\nof university students who take the\nbus.\nExam officers in every department\ncurrently holding mid-year tests\nhave been inundated with emails\nfrom bus commuters who were\notherwise completely cut off from\ncampus.\nOne first year aero student from\nPembridge Gardens found herself\nunable to reach college, with the\nindustrial action rendering the 52\nand 452 busses out of action.\n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she told Hangman\nin a coffee shop on Notting Hill Gate,\nwith Queen\u2019s Tower visible in the\nmiddle-distance over Hyde Park.\n\u201cTry as I might there was no possible\nway to get to the department in time\nfor my exams.\u201d\nMeanwhile, undergrads in other\nyears were left to attempt a day\u2019s\nexperimenting alone across several\nfaculties. \u201cMy lab partner just texted\nto say he can\u2019t make it because of the\nbus strike,\u201d a third year was quoted\nas saying, \u201cwhich I guess would be\nokay, but we live in the same flat. On\nFulham Road.\u201d\nfringe obscuring his face. He had a\nMacBook open in front of him, and\nhad already started sorting through\nthe messages he had received that\nday.\n\u201cI mean, I just really feel like I am\nmaking a difference,\u201d he told us,\nwhilst trawling through the Google\ndocument submissions. \u201cPeople come\nto this page to really discuss how they\nfeel, and I think people appreciate\nthat.\u201d\nHe highlighted a post calling out\nsomeone in Beit Hall \u201ca fucking\nuseless wanker,\u201d and published it to\nthe page, before taking a bite from\nhis jacket potato. \u201cPeople at Imperial\nneed an outlet where we can be\nourselves, connect as a community,\nand maybe share a bit of banter too.\u201d\nHe shrugged, before dragging\nanother post into the status bar,\nwhich names and shames some girl in\nWilson who had apparently slept with\nnumerous people on her corridor.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit distant, elusive,\nand separate from Imperial before\nnow. I\u2019ve never really lived out of\nhalls before, and in second year I was\nfailing my degree.\u201d\nHe toys with removing her name,\nwhilst continuing with his train\nof thought. \u201cI decided to sort my\nacademic record out, so basically\nmoved into the library on the fourth\nfloor. It was then I got the idea for the\npage, and it seems to have taken off\nsince then.\u201d\nHe pauses, then decides to delete\nher name, before adding, \u201cI feel like\npeople almost trust me, you know?\u201d\nHe opens the page, and shows us a\nprevious post, which features a link to\na picture of someone\u2019s faecal matter\nin a sink. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to hide\nwho they are anymore.\u201d\nHe picks a thread from his beige\ntrench coat absentmindedly as he\ntells us how he plans to return home\nto Singapore soon, once he graduates.\nWe ask him what will happen to his\npage after, and he tells us of his plans\nto continue to run it remotely.\nA sly smile crosses his face, and he\nleans in. \u201cCollege tutors can\u2019t get me if\nI\u2019m out of the country, you know?\u201d\nHe re-adds the girl\u2019s name to the\ndrafted post, pauses, then adds, \u201cFuck\nyou, you skank!\u201d before pressing\nsubmit.\nHe leans back in his chair, and then\nmuses, \u201cEveryone loves free speech,\neh? People appreciate that we tell the\ntruth, even if it hurts.\u201d\nHe collects his notebook, oversized\nheadphones and camera, and we\nshake hands before he leaves to\nreturn to the library. \u201cI would just say,\ndon\u2019t hate, appreciate, yeah?

After the Tottenham\ndefeat Chelsea and Manchester\nCity could in fact only be separated\nby alphabetical order. Since then,\nthough, Chelsea has opened a two-point gap.\nJust behind them in the table\nis Southampton, who won at Old\nTrafford for the first time in 27 years\nto overtake Louis van Gaal\u2019s side\nand go third. Manchester United are\nnow in fourth, two points behind\nSouthampton, and one ahead of\nArsenal.\nThe bottom of the table is also\nvery close, with just three points\nseparating twelfth placed Everton\nand nineteenth placed Queens Park\nRangers. The other two teams in the\nrelegation zone are Hull City and\nLeicester City.\nThe manager merry-go-round as\nalready started. Neil Warnock and\nAlan Irvine have been sacked and\nreplaced by Alan Pardew and Tony\nPulis respectively. Newcastle are\ncurrently looking for a manager.\nWilfried Bony has completed a move\nto Manchester City from Swansea for\n\u00a328m.\nChed Evans is still searching for a\nnew club to play at after a proposed\ndeal with Oldham Athletic fell\nthrough. Oldham had contacted\nsponsors to inform them that a deal\nhad been agreed, but reversed their\ndecision in light of sponsors backing\nout and a 40,000 strong petition.\nEvans, while still maintaining his\ninnocence, would later apologise.\nThe previous day he had released a\nstatement saying that he blamed \u2018mob\nrule\u2019 as the talks were terminated.\nIn cricket, Indian captain\nMahendra Singh Dhoni retired from\nTest Match cricket after the third\ntest against Australia in Melbourne.\nDhoni had played 90 tests in his\ncareer. His replacement as captain,\nVirat Kohli, became the first person\nto score three centuries in his first\nthree innings as captain, when he\nscored 147 in the fourth test in\nSydney. Australian captain Steve\nSmith scored a century in each test\nas Australia won the series 2-0 to\nreclaim the Border-Gavaskar trophy.\nSacked England batsman Kevin\nPietersen caused a stir during a\ncommentary stint in the Big Bash\nin Australia. Pietersen said \u201cI know\nthat the current [one-day] captain\nwould love to have me in the England\nteam.\u201d He later added: \u201cI want to play\nfor England. I honestly believe I am\nbatting as well as I have ever batted at\nthe moment.\u201d\nIn tennis, Andy Murray has been\nseeded sixth for the Australian Open.\nHe beat a top-four player for the first\ntime since the Wimbledon final in\n2013 when he thrashed Rafael Nadal\nin the semi-final of an exhibition\ntournament in Abu Dhabi. He\nwould go on to win the tournament,\nas Novak Djokovic pulled out of\nthe tournament having fallen ill.\nDjokovic then suffered a shock\ndefeat at the hands of 35-year-old Ivo\nKarlovic in the quarter-finals of the\nQatar Open in Doha.\nRoger Federer created history when\nhe secured his 1000th career win on\nthe ATP tour. The milestone victory\ncame for Federer in the final of the\nBrisbane International. He beat\nMilos Raonic in a hard fought match\nthat went the distance, with Federer\neventually prevailing 6-4 6-7 (2-7) 6-4.\nFederer is the third person to reach\nthe landmark. Jimmy Connors was\nthe first, while the most recent player\n(Ivan Lendl) reached the milestone\nin 1992. Federer demonstrated the\nimmense form he is currently in with\na 39-minute victory over Australian\nhopeful James Duckworth in the\nquarter-finals. Federer said of the\n1000th win: \u201cI\u2019ve played a lot of\ntennis over the years so to get to 1,000\nwins means a lot to me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special moment, no doubt\nabout that. I will never forget this\nmatch.\u201d\nJo-Wilfried Tsonga and US Open\nChampion Marin Cilic have pulled\nout of the Australian Open due to\ninjuries.\nIn a light-hearted moment, Serena\nWilliams, having lost the first set to\nFlavia Penneta 6-0 at the Hopman\nCup in Perth, asked the chair umpire\nif it was against the rules to have\na coffee. She would later order an\nespresso from a ball girl (citing jet lag\nas the issue), before going on to win\nthe match convincingly.\nIn rugby, Ben Morgan has been\nruled out of the Six Nations with a\nbroken leg. Saracens lock George\nKruis was cited for a tip tackle and\nsubsequently banned for three\nweeks. He will be available for the Six\nNations.\nAnd finally, Paula Radcliffe has\nannounced that she will run the\nLondon Marathon in April, but that\nit will be her last ever race.\nChelsea have seen their lead in the Premier League cut significantly since Christmas.

The\npostgraduate paper allegedly covered\nmore theoretical derivations than the\nundergraduate equivalent, although\nthe department stated that the exams\nwere apparently of similar difficulty.\nPostgraduates and undergraduates\nare taught the same modules\nindependently throughout the year.\nThe department told us that this is\nbecause of space constraints and also\nto limit class sizes.\nWhen contacted, the Aeronautics\nadmin team told Felix that the mix-up was \u201ca simple human error,\u201d and\nthat the students would be offered\nthe marks of the paper they sat,\nbut could re-sit the module if they\nwere unhappy with the results. \u201cBe\nreassured we are doing everything\nto assist them so that they are not\ndisadvantaged in any way.\u201d\nFelix spoke to one of the students\ninvolved, and said that he thought\nthe department had handled the\nmix-up satisfactorily but that he\nwould probably be re-sitting the exam\nafter all. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was hard\nbecause it was a different paper or\njust because I hadn\u2019t revised!

Under the changes,\nclubs that hit the criteria would have\nto hold their committee elections as\npart of the Big Elections. Despite this,\nvoting would still only be available\nfor members of that society.\nThe move has been hit with\ncriticism from some societies\nthat would be affected under the\nnew scheme. One society said\nthat they would be meeting with\nrepresentatives from the Union on\nFriday to discuss the changes. Cinema\nand Squash have also voiced concern,\nand their comments can be found\nbelow.\nSome clubs have claimed that they\nweren\u2019t consulted about the proposed\nchanges and were instead just told\nthat they were being implemented.\nWhen asked about this, Abi de\nBruin, Deputy President (Clubs\nand Societies), said, \u201cLast year we\nran a trial of inclusion of some\nof the Clubs, Societies & Projects\u2019\nelections in The Big Elections process.\nSeveral of the larger student groups\nwere approached and some clubs\nspecifically asked to be included as\npart of The Big Elections.\n\u201cThe general feedback we had was\nthat it was a positive change that\nincreased turnout and also reduced\nadministrative work. The Union\nGovernance Committee discussed\nboth of these outcomes from the test\nlast year and made the decision to\nmove all elections for Clubs, Societies\nor Projects with more than 150\nmembers online.\u201d\nDe Bruin also said, \u201cIt did also\nhighlight to us that some of the\ngroups weren\u2019t actually holding\ndemocratic elections in line with the\nrules set out in our bye-laws\u201d. Last\nyear Felix reported that two student\nsocieties \u2013 the Christian Union\nDo you want to pursue a career in European and international affairs,\ninternational business or national administration?

The CU have fewer than\n150 members and aren\u2019t affected by\nthe changes, but the CSSA will have\nto have their elections in the Big\nElections.\nWhen asked why the number 150\nspecifically was chosen, de Bruin\nsaid, \u201cThis number was chosen to\nreflect the reality of the size of lecture\ntheatres available to hold offline\nelections in.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cWe communicated\nthis change to those affected at the\nbeginning of the month and have\nreceived some feedback from groups\nwho would prefer not to be involved\nin the online election. In each case\nwe\u2019ve asked for the reasons for\nthis and will, in cases where a clear\ndemonstration of how their current\nor planned election process will be\nfully democratic, make appropriate\nexemptions from the rule.\u201d\nMedics laughing all the\nway to the food bank\nImperial medical students made a\nlast-minute but sizable donation\nto the local food bank earlier this\nmonth, after collecting dried goods\nbefore the Christmas bop at the end of\nlast year.\nStudents brought non-perishable\nfoods to the Reynolds building on the\nlast day of the autumn term, which\nwere crated up and collected by the\nlocal food bank after Christmas.\nThree crates were filled all in all:\namassing to a total of just under 44kg\nof food that included tinned goods,\npasta and cartons of juice and long\nlife milk.\nThe amount of food collected\nwill be able to feed between 8 to 10\npeople for up to three days. The food\nbank, which serves Hammersmith\nand Fulham residents, donates the\ncollections to those in the local area\nwho are referred to the centre by\nsocial services, their local GP, their\nschool or any other frontline care\nprofessionals.\nDaphine Aikens, a member of\nstaff who works at the bank, spoke to\nFelix. Daphine thanked the students\nof Imperial for the kind donation,\nand told us what a difference it can\nmake to those who are in difficult\ncircumstances.\n\u201cPeople who come to the food bank\nmay not have eaten for days on end\nand may not even know where there\nnext meal will come from.\n\u201cIt is great that we can say the\ndonations came from someone in the\nlocal community, including a medical\nstudent from Charing cross hospital,\nor a mum who lives down the street or\na local business. That is very powerful\nand meaningful to these people\nreceiving the food.\u201d\nThe collection was organised by the\nImperial College School of Medicine\nStudent\u2019s Union (ICSMSU), and\nMala Mawkin, the current social\nsecretary, told us how inspiring it was\nto see classmates and other students\ndonating to the cause. Mala said\n\u201cWhat was really nice was that even\nthough we were all poor students by\nthe end of last term, everyone still\nwas giving what they could to the\npeople that needed it most.\u201d\nICSMSU President, Dariush\nHassanzadeh-Baboli concluded: \u201cWe\nare very proud of our students.

Photo: Stephen Flavin/Artists Rights Society (ARS),\nhave Nazgol Ansarinia, whose cut and\npaste versions of Tehran\u2019s newspapers\ndraw a direct line from the dadaists\nto today.\nAnother interesting aspect of\nthe exhibition is the focus it places\non women artists. The majority of\nthe art world is largely focussed on\nmale artists, mostly dead, nearly\nuniversally white \u2013 the abstract\nmodernist movement is no exception.\nFor many art historians, the story\nbegins with Malevich, and ends with\nrugged American minimalists like\nFlavin and Richard Serra. Slipping\nthrough the cracks are innumerable\nwomen artists, particularly those of a\nminority. Luckily, the curators of this\nexhibition have clearly undertaken\nmeticulous research, and can offer us\na wealth of little-known artists.\nA personal favourite of mine is\nDora Maurer, a Hungarian artist\nwho defied the official censors of the\n1970s by refusing to conform to the\nSocialist Realist movement; instead\nshe pursued her interest in abstract\nphotography in her Rotations series.\nInitially holding up a blank square,\nshe repeatedly photographs herself,\ntwisting the camera around until her\nform dissolves into a kaleidoscopic\nmirage of shape and form. Another\nEastern European artist, B\u011bla\nKol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, explores the role that\nfeminine articles can play within\nart, creating abstract compositions\nwith cosmetic samples and clothes\nfastening; by using such material,\ntraditionally dismissed as frivolous\nand immaterial, Kol\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 makes us\nreinterpret what we mean when we\nmake such judgements. After all,\nwhat could be a better representation\nof Soviet industry than the miniscule\npoppers, meticulous in their detail,\nthat make up her work?\nIt is easy to overlook the political\nand social connotations of abstract\nart. From our vantage point, it is\ndifficult to see Malevich\u2019s Black\nSquare as anything other than a\nplayful jibe at traditional art, let\nalone a severe political threat, but\nthis is not always the case. Malevich\ncould feel the rising tension in the\nUSSR, and fled the country in 1927,\nleaving his work to be destroyed by\nthe censors. Klutsis never got out; he\nwas murdered by officials under the\norder of Stalin. This atmosphere of\ntragedy is one that never quite leaves\nthe exhibition, but there is youthful\noptimism in there too. These artists\nbelieved, and still believe, in a better\nfuture through abstraction.\nModern political links are explored\nthrough the work of American artist\nJenny Holzer; in TOP SECRET 24\nthe black square becomes areas\nof censored documents, the text\nredacted by the US government as\npart of their war on terror. What\nwas in 1915 a symbol of hope and\noptimism now has become a tool used\nby an oppressive regime, a powerful\nreminder that art is a tool for both\nliberalism and totalitarianism. The\nvery spirit of abstract modernism has\nits roots in revolution, with many of\nthe original Russian constructivists\nseeing their art as a means of\nfurthering the dictatorship of the\nproletariat, and therefore it should\nbe no surprise that the political is\nintertwined with the aesthetic. Even\nwith this expectation, however,\nthe dearth of art coming out of\nAltin America during the years of\nnumerous military juntas is still\nharrowing, leaving a noticeable gap in\nthe time-frame of the exhibition.\nWe end on a brighter note, with\nan exploration of the legacy of\nthe black square by Scottish artist\nDavid Batchelor; he attempts to\noppose the overwhelming tendency\nfor chromophobia among the arts\ncommunity by filling the blank space\nwith expanses of colour. He takes the\nsquare apart, filling it with coloured\nbaubles; a black triangle becomes a\nComposition with Yellow, Blue, and Red, Piet Mondrian, 1937-1942, Oil paint\non canvas Photo: DACS, London/VAGA, New York 2014\npyramid, spouting beams of bright\nlight in rainbow colours. He turns the\nblack void on its head, and by doing\nso reveals the bright new future that\nit promises. Abstraction has always\nhad a sense of humour and fun at its\ncore, as well as a never-ending hope\nfor a brighter, better tomorrow; the\nWhitechapel Gallery has recognised\nthis, and avoided the po-faced\nseriousness that often accompanies\ndiscussion of the abstract art\nmovement. We are invited along for\nan adventure that charts a century of\ncreativity, chaos, and celebration; I\nsuggest that you go along for the ride.\nAdventures of the Black Square:\nAbstract Art and Society, 1915 - 2015\nis running from 15th January until 6th\nApril.

Philippa Skett reports\nImperial Professor David Nutt has\nbegun research on a legal high\nthat mimics ecstasy but may also\nstop binge drinking. The drug, known\nas Chaperon, is still being developed\nbut could one day be available as a\ncocktail in bars across the country.\nThe idea of Chaperon occurred\naround a year ago to the anonymous\nDr. Z, a mathematician who\npreviously created mephedrone.\nChaperon is the trade name for\nMEAI, or 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane.\nMEAI simultaneously invokes a\nchemical pleasure in those that\ntake it and also makes alcohol seem\nrepulsive, inhibiting consumption.\nDr. Z and Nutt hope that the drug\ncould be taken to mitigate binge\ndrinking but also deliver a relaxing\nhigh, described by some as an \u201cintense\neuphoria.\u201d\nDr. Z initially planned for MEAI to\nbe sold as yet another legal high, but\nhas now gifted the provisional patent\nof MEAI and a number of other\nchemically similar compounds to\nProfessor Nutt\u2019s charitable research\ngroup, DrugScience.org.uk.\nThis family of compounds is\nnot particularly novel: they were\ndiscovered around 20 years ago as a\nmeans to treat depression. Although\nthey are proven to have neurological\neffects, the idea to use these\ncompounds to combat binge drinking\nis new however and something Nutt\nand his team are keen to develop.\nMEAI has shown the most promise\nso far, so research is now underway to\ndetermine optimum doses, discover\nany potential side effects and look at\nthe safest way for people to consume\nthe drug and benefit from its\ninfluence.\nFelix spoke to Nutt, who told us\nhow the idea to address and reduce\nthe harmful effects of alcohol is\nnothing new, but the direction in\nwhich to approach this is constantly\nevolving.\nNutt told us: \u201cWe could develop\nan alternative or look to produce a\nsubstance that moderates the effect\nof alcohol. I found that it is difficult\nto find alternatives to alcohol, so we\nneed something that moderates it\ninstead.\nChaperon can be taken with\nalcohol as opposed to substituting\nit completely. It will hopefully\nminimise the harm, maximise\nthe pleasure and limit the alcohol\nconsumption.\u201d\nSo how long will it be before this\nwonder drug hits bars and pubs?\nNutt plans to ensure that the social\nculture surrounding sensible alcohol\nconsumption is maintained, telling\nFelix that still wants to keep people\nin bars, and would prefer the drug\nto be served as a cocktail in an more\nup-market bar. \u201cI want it to appeal to\npeople who care about their health\nand pleasure, but want to reduce the\nharm of drinking too.\n\u201cI want to put drinking back into\nclubs; too much drinking goes on\noutside this drinking environment.\nI would really only want Chaperon\navailable in licensed premises, not\nsomething that people sit in front of\nthe television swigging!\u201d\nAlthough the patent is provisional,\nwith enough research and funding\nthe drug could be issued a complete\npatent that will then last a further\nten years and allow for the drug to be\ndeveloped for commercial sales.\nClinical and human trials of the\ndrug have yet to be conducted under\ncontrolled conditions, all of which\nare dependant on more investors\nsitting up and taking notice. With\nthe different stages of development\nneeded for drugs being expensive\nand lengthy, the cost will no doubt\nbe high but there is no total figure on\nhow much it will take to get MEAI\nout of labs into bars as of yet.\nFinally, we asked Nutt if he had\ntried MEAI himself. \u201cOf course I\nhave!\u201d he chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like\nalcohol; it\u2019s relaxing and pleasant but\nit doesn\u2019t make you want to drink\nmore. I haven\u2019t tried it with alcohol,\nbut will do so once we\u2019ve pinpointed a\ndosage that works.\u201d\nSo how long could it be before\nwe order Chaperon instead of\nChardonnay? Concluded Nutt: \u201cThe\nbottom line is whoever puts money\non the table determines whether\nor not this happens, but I\u2019m very\noptimistic and excited to see how our\nresearch develops.\u201d\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n"
