    "content": "TRE EftRQR\nOF\nCHEAPSKATE One morning, as the clouds began to break\nand sun shone down over Cheapskate's symbolic tower, Baron Weed stepped out\nonto the veranda and stared across the lawns\nthat confronted him. Taking a deep breath,\ntrying desperately to clear his head after a most enjoyable evening with his\ncontemporaries, the Baron noticed with\npleasure all those signs of the approaching\nSpring which he knew so well: flowers,\npoking their heads through the soil, Lady\nMarigold's announcement of plans for\nforthcoming holidays\u2014on her own\u2014and the\nconcerned expressions of the citizens, as the\nmurmur of 'examinations' spread like an\nunstoppable cancer through o 'ut their\nnumber.\n'And no committee meetings for a whole\nfortnight,' thought the Baron. 'And with any\nluck the newspapers will stop criticising me.\nThe cuts are too bad\u2014and I am preserving\nthe status quo. What more do they want?'\nReminded of his failed attempts to control\nFALIX the Baron concluded that the media\nwould always be a, thorn in his side and\nreturned to his study to sulk.\nThe thoughts of spring were concerning\nothers that day. Gormless Layon, President\nof the Citizens Association, was sitting in the\nCitizen's Office talking to Mrs Jolly HockeyStocks about the behaviour of her suitor, Ian\nBalls. Her agonising was to little avail since\nMrs Hockey-Sticks was in the usual drunken\nstupor she was to be found in at that time of\nthe morning.\n'Spring\u2014when a young man's thoughts\nturn to love!' Gormless announced forlornly,\nrecalling how her suitor Ian Balls had spent\nthe previous evening drinking and playing\ncards with his new-found friends Eric Sloth\nand Dave Paralytic.\nPage 10\\\nFor Gormless had begun to worry. Ever\nsince his election, Balls had never been quite\nthe same to her. No longer did she find twelve\nred roses outside her door in the morning.\nGone was the time when Balls would appear at\nher window, having shinned up the drainpipe\nwaving a box of her favourite chocolates.\nNow Gormless had to ask him to get out of\nher chair, enquire if they could possibly have\na 'nice, quiet night in-to^-i her' only to be told\nthat he was off drinking again. He was even\nmaking all the decisions without telling\nGormless what he had done. Gormless was\ndepressed. 'Thesonly one think ferret (hie!)'\nexclaimed Mrs Hockey-sticks. She took the\nlarge rusty key hung per ment ly around her\nneck and weaved her way sinusoidal ly toward the sherry cabinet.\nGormless glanced out of the window and\nspotted Pristine, the wicked bitch\u2014whoops,\nWitch of Southside, gliding across the sunlit,\ngleaming tower, astride her broomstick.\nPristine threw back her hands in joy. Her\nlong, black hair blowing in the wind and her\nteeth glinting in the sunlight, warning all of\nher presence, she was joyous at the prospect\nof what was to come. For she had obtained a rare herb, that only appeared briefly at the\nstart of spring, which was to be the basis of\none of her most powerful spells yet.\nSwooping down low Pristine flew through an\nopen window and landing softly on Jo\nHenawhatshername. Beckoning Gormless,\nPristine put her broomstick in the corner and\nwent into her office. There, above a smouldering log fire, hung a huge steaming\nUnable to contain his excitement,\nHuge jumped for joy\ncauldron. At its side, Huge Pigeon\u2014the\ncitizens' representative in charge of pleading\nf qr better gruel\u2014was jumping up and down\nincessantly, unable to contain his\nexcitement.\n'Ooo, Pristine are we actually going to do\nsomething? What do you want me to do?\nShall I call a committee meeting? Oh, just\nthink I 'll be able to put my face all over the\nfront cover of FALIX again! Oh goodie.' His\nboy-scout eagerness and endless willingness\nto oblige those in power merely irritated his\nidol and mentor Pristine who found him an\nunnecessary interference in her plans.\nIan had spent the previous drinking and playing cards with his new found\nfriends Eric Sloth and Dave Paralytic.\nI Wednesday,\njumping around and cm\nshe cackled, adding the final ingredients.\nSuch remarks merely washed over the\nirrepressible Huge who, obliging as ever,\nhopped up to the door, nearly slamming it in\nthe face of the recently elected Dave\nParalytic.\nParalytic was a man born long after his\ntime. Bearded, of almost tramp-like\nappearance, he shuffled from one pos l to the\nnext, merely trying to find somewhere to sit\ndown and have an easy time. And like so\nmany other people with that ambition, the\ncitizens' office was his final port of call.\n'Have you seen Eric?' he enquired of Jo\nHenherwhatshername who had barely\nrecovered from Pristine's unexpected\narrival.\n'I think he's in Sawnoff's office,' she replied,\nrubbing herself where the sharp end of the\nbroom had found itself.\nParalytic peeped round the door and\nfound his colleague and playmate Eric Sloth,\ncurled up by the printing match in e fast\nasleep. 'Practising for next year I suppose,'\nParalytic shrugged.\nLater that morning the door to Pristine's office flew open and Huge leapt out shouting\n'I 've got it, I 've got it. All the other citizens\nrepresentatives have failed but I 've achieved\nthe impossible.' Unable to contain his\nexcitement, Huge jumped around for joy and\npromptly knocked a couple of glasses and\nkicked the already suffering Jo in the shins.\nPristine, however, emerged and having told\nHuge to shut up, proceeded to explain her\nachievement.\n'I put all the figures I had into the pot and\nwith a little encouragement and a touch of the\nmagic formula I discovered when I was doing\nsomeone else's job a few years ago I produced these results.\nQuite literally by magic Pristine had\nproduced out of thin air a most important set\nof figures\u2014numbers which revealed\nthat the Citizens could run one\nof Victor Munch ey' s gruel outlets\nat a profit.\n'I 'll go down as the most important\nPresident, er, Vice-President for years'\nannounced Pristine proudly.\n'And I'm bound to get President's job,' said\nHuge, who had by this time managed to hop\nhis way into Pristine's cauldron.\n'All we now need to do is get Simon\nPerrier's approval and we're home and dry,'\nsaid Huge. But his complacency was\nunjustified for Pristine had foolishly left one of\nthe windows of her office open out of which\nhad blown a sheet of paper containing details\nof the plans. And later the same day, that\nvery piece of paper was upon the desk of\nDong Lark, the Baron's Secretary of Estates.\n'We're going to have something proper to\ndo again!' said Dong, most pleased at the\nprospect. 'Do you remember all the fun we\nhad when we refurbished the Citizens'\nRefectory last time?'\nAs ever, Dong was addressing his twin and\ndeputy Headbang Cameroon Lark.\n'Oh. yes,' replied Headbang looking up\nfrom his crossword puzzle. 'All that kno c king\nthings down and ripping things up\u2014and we\ndidn't have to take any notice of anyone else.\nHeadbang spread the tablecloth across\nDong's desk and started putting out all of the\nchina. Tea time was a great tradition for the\nMarch 21, 1984\nhome with his conscience satisfied.\nLate that same evening, long after\nSouthside Tavern had closed and the citizens\nhad departed to their rooms, two shadowy\nfigures appeared from nowe here and merged\nin the darkness of the adjacent gardens. After\nwhispering one word they contorted their\narms and shook each others hands in a most\nunusual fashion. The larger of the two\nhanded over a small document containing\nthe most delicate of secrets. As the recipient\nwalked away, disappearing quickly into the\nnight, the other stood a short while watching\nthe other depart. Drawing items from his\npocket he lit a cigarette, the brief burst of\nlight revealed the grotesque features of\nVictor Munchey, the chieftan of all the\nBaron's kitchens. For he knew how to stop\nPristine's plans. J q be continued Headbang spread the tablecloth accross Dong's desk and started putting\nout all of the china.\ntwo of them, taking up the majority of the\nafternoon. Together, they began to discuss\nwhat they were going to do to the refectory.\n'Well,' said Dong having tasted the tea\nwhich had been so dutifully prepared for him\nand found it satisfactory 'I think that we need\na new door in the place\u2014and some more\nlights.'\n'Oh yes, replied Headbang nibbling at his\ntoast 'and let's get rid of all those awful chairs\nand tables\u2014they do get in the way. Perhaps\nwe ought to put a partition down the middle,\nto separate off the bar?\\\n'Now that's a very good idea\u2014HI get\nsomeone to draw up the plans. And we can\nuse up some of that scaffolding l hafs lying\naround the place\u2014perhaps u ui lda climbing\nframe....\"\n'Oh, don't be silly,' replied Headbang\ndistressed at the thought of citizens crawling\nall over the scaffolding of which he was so\nproud.\n'Although we could get rid of a few tiles\nhere and there. Why don'tI get someone to\nstand at the bottom and catch them from the\nElectrical building. It'll be rather like a game\nof cricket.'\n'Oh, now you're just being silly. If you're\ngoing to be like that I 'll walk out. Don't you\nknow it's your turn to pour the tea, I'm always\ndoing it '\nWhile Headbang and Dong sat arguing, the\nnews reached John Secretary of Pristine's plans through his network of spies and\ninformers. He had been out-manoeuvre d and\nwas not amused.\n'Gormless really ought to know her place.\nThe only possible solution to these matters is\nto close the refectory\u2014it's always worked in\nthe past,' he announced. The only thing\nlistening was a small rat which had been\nscratching around John Secretary's dungeon desperately trying in vain to find a few crumbs. The rat departed, leaving John\nalone. But solitude was a most agreeable\nstate for him\u2014especially when scheming. He\nconcluded that he did not wish to bloody his\nhands further and decided to arrange for\nothers to stop the plans before they even got\noff the ground. One telephone call was\nenough for John Secretary to depart for]\nthe grotesque features of Victor\nMunchey, the chieftan of all the\nBaron's kitchens. ' _ _ \u2022 MM HH HM B MH Mi Page "

As\nRSC U President he has coped\nwith the resignation of our\nHon Sec (Sue Humphrey) at\nthe beginning of the Christmas\nTerm, both persuading her to\ncarry on with the organisation\nof Fresher's Dinners and\ngetting the rest of her duties\ndone while a new Hon Sec was\nelected.\nHe has run the RSC U elections this year properly and\nfairly with the highest number\nof votes in living memory. This\nis indicative that people both\nknow and care about RSC U and should be ascribed not\nonly to the candidates but also\nto his leadership over the past\nyear. Eric has also recovered\n\u00a3600 from ICU to support two\nsocieties which were to be\nkilled off, but have made a strong comeback.\nAll in all, we do not believe,\nas do you, that he will be a sloth in the office, merely\nadhering to his job description\nand doing bugger all else.\nWe think he will make a good\nHon Sec with his other interests such as Rag and finance\noccupying him usefully.

From colleges all ove i the\ncountry, students arrived by\nthe coach-load to demonstrate\nagainst the planned cuts to\nfurther education spending by\nthe government. Some students\neven arrived from Ireland to\ntake part. The only blot on the\nproceedings was that fewer\nthan 30 IC students managed\nPage 2M\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ WMUM\n!Letter5-to-f he Eyi?orr\nto drag themselves all the way\nfrom South Kensington to take\na stand. More to the point,\nwhere were our elected rep-resent at ives? Not s uprising ly, not one sabbatical turned up;\nnor did any of the recently\nelected people (so much for\ntheir promises to 'fight' for this\nand that...) with the exception,\nI am told, of Ann Collins of\nRCS. The only union official\npresent was Peter Burt, our\nExternal Affairs Officer who,\nthankfully, is really committed\nto his job.\nSo maybe this event was\norganised by the NUS, to\nwhom we refuse to re affiliate. The issue, however, affects us\nall. How would you manage\nwithout a real grant? It's about\ntime students and their supposed representatives at IC\nrealised that apathy is not\nenough. Our rift with the NUS is particularly hypocritical seen\nin this light - we s jar vive in their\nwake; if it was left to IC.\nstudents to fight for their own\nliving and working conditions, this college would fade\naway altogether.\nHigher education in this\ncountry is in real danger. Here\nwas a chance for us to say\nsomething about it; here was a chance for those who are paid\nto represent us - yet are so\nremote from us - to show they\nare actually concerned; and\nwhat happens? Nothing. Such\noverwhelming apathy is both\nsickening and saddening.\nChristine Toing\nMech Eng 1\nCut the\nFascist Jibes\nDear Pallab\nI was disgusted to see that the\nfairly sensible and objective\nnews item in FELIX two weeks'\nago about UGC cuts was given\nsuch an irresponsible and\nextremely offensive heading. By\nprinting that item under the\nheading 'More Fascist Tory\nCuts' you insult the democratic\nsystem of British Government,\nI Wednesday,\nyou deny the rights of people to\nhave a different view from\nyours without being given an\nunpleasant label, and you\ndecrease the likelihood of\nFELIX being taken seriously by\nanyone.\nGiving you the benefit of the\ndoubt, you are merely guilty of\nunethical journalism because of\nyour gross inaccuracy. The\nShorter O^i or d Dictionary\ndefines a Fascist as 'one of a body of Italian nationalists\norganised in 1919 under Benito\n\u2022\"Mussolini to oppose Bolshevism'. Anyone with the\nslightest knowledge of politics\nwill know that (as well as there\nbeing a distinct lack of Italian\nnationalists in the Conservative\nparty), there is no similarity\nbetween modern Tory philosophy (based on freedom\nof the individual) and Fascism\n(based on state regulation of the\neconomy and people's lives).\nIf one were to be slightly less\nkind, one might extrapolate\nfrom the usual frivolous style of\nFELIX, and assume that\n'Fascist' was meant to be taken\nin the colloquial sense, ie Nazi.\nIn that case you would be\ncomparing (in a subtle and\nin si duo us way) the cutting of a particular aspect of public\nexpenditure with genocide,\nmass torture and the complete\nextermination of all possible\nopposition. Such an implication would be immoral journalism, and would cast\ngrave doubts on your editorial\ncompetence and s cr up u less ness..\nTo add insult to injury, you\nincluded a caricature of me in\nlast week's 'Sucker' cartoon\nabout education cuts. I am not\nashamed of taking a broader\nview of the situation than\npeople like you and Peter Burt\ndo. There are many interest\ngroups, all crying for a larger\nhandout from the 'bottomless\npit of government financial\nresources,' and students are\nonly one of them. Students at\nIC are the same people who in a few years time will be\ncomplaining that personal\ntaxation is too high. I consider\nyour actions in printing that\ncartoon a form of intimidation,\nMarch 21, 19849LW S BL Vm MIM ie 'If you dare to dissent from\nthe left-wing views of FELIX hacks and Union hacks, we\nshall use the Union publication\nto portray you in a ridiculous\nmanner'. I hope that this\neditorial thug ger y will cease,\nand FELIX will at least attempt\nto take an objective stance on\npolitical issues.\nYours sincerely\nJonathan Gerson\nMines\nPorn Night\nDear Pallab,\nLast Friday, another pornographic event was organised\nby the Royal School of Mines\nUnion. We do not question the\nlegality of such an event, as the\nresults of several UG Ms show\nsympathy to such happenings,\nbut now set out some of our\nobjections to pornography,\nwhich stem from our commitment to God as Christians,\nleaving aside many of the\nmoral, humanistic arguments\nwhich have already been\npresented.\nThere are many forms of\nidolatry, and pornographic\nobsession is one, because a gift\nof God our human sexuality -which is intended to be a joyful\nself-giving act within the\nsanctity of marriage, is removed from that environment\nand placed above its proper\nposition.\nIn attempting to fill one's sexual desires, whether in\nfornication or being stimulated\nby any pornographic medium,\nthe motive is rooted selfish\nambition or greed, which is in\nexact opposition to the attitude\nGod wishes us to have in all\nthings, not least in our personal sexuality. Our sexuality\nis given to us for affirmation,\nsustain ance and healing, one\npartner to another; pornography removes the life and\nreal humanity from this, am nd instead leads into a cul-de-sac\nof fet led fantasies. St Paul\nwrites \"there are no forbidden\nthings; maybe, but not everything does good.\"\nPornography is also a destroyer of our sexual growth:\nwhile one's physical maturity\nmay be fully developed, engagement in pornography leaves one's mind in an extended adolescence, which\nlimits sexual fulfilment to\ngenital stimulation and mast-ur bator y experiences.

    "content": "Feature\nTHE FUTURE OF LONDON'S EDUCATION\nThreats to ILEA\nGovernment plans will be of\ndirect relevance to many of\nLondon's students through their\neffect on the Inner London\nEducation Authority (ILEA).\nILEA is responsible for public\neducated in the twelve inner\nLondon boroughs and the City of\nLondon. It is constitutionally a special committee of the GLC, but is financially, politically, and\nadministratively independent of\nthe GLC. Changes to ILEA planned by the Government\nwould quite simply wreck\nLondon's education service and\nhave been opposed by all parties\non ILEA.\nILEA is threatened by two\nWhite Papers currently before\nParliament.\nRates\nThe' Rates' bill under consideration will, if passed,\nallow Central Government to\nsingle out a handful of 'over-spending' local authorities and\ndetermine the maximum rate\nthey can legally raise. Informed\nsources do not doubt that ILEA would appear on the Governments 'hit list'. The consequence\nof this would be a reduction of\n\u00a3 120m \u2014almost 13%\u2014in ILEA spending, resulting in a catalogue\nof disasters; redundancies, cuts in\nequipment spending in schools,\nclosure of courses and colleges,\nbigger classes and, of course, a general drop in standards.\ndraconian\npowers\nFew IC students would suffer\nas a result of this. However,\nILEA administers five polytechnics and 29 other colleges.\nThese could face, for instance, a doubling of hostel and catering\ncharges and early closure in\nwinter to save fuel. Cuts in ILEA discretionary awards could mean\nno grant for 1,500 students.\nThe 'Rates' Bill has received\nparticularly harsh criticism.\nEdward Heath, a former Prime\nMinister, described it as\nconferring 'draconian powers'.\nMr Heath has said that central\ngovernment has not needed these\npowers previously\u2014even during\ntwo world wars.\nHowever, the scheme is set to be\nimplemented this summer.\nThe Government intends to abolish the Greater London\nCouncil (GLC) and the six Metropolitan Country Councils\n(MCCs). They also plan to introduce 'rate capping' legislation this summer. These plans are a serious threat to the\nautonomy of Local Authorities and to democracy itself.\nWhat will they mean for London's education?\n'Streamlining the Cities'\nThe 'Streamlining the Cities'\nWhite Paper which deals with the\nabolition of the GLC and M CCs plans to retain a unified\neducation service in Inner\nLondon. However, a new\nauthority would be set up to\nad minster this service, thus\nreplacing ILEA. This would be a joint board, consisting of about\nfifty councillors nominated by\nthe Inner London boroughs and\nthe City of London. Londoners\nwould therefore no longer\ndirectly elect an education\nauthority, and borough councillors would take on an\nadditional heavy workload to\nwhich they were not particularly\nsuited.\nAll political parties on ILEA have expressed their reservations\nto the plans. The White Paper\ngives only a mere outline of proposed changes and has clearly\nbeen rushed and poorly pre-pared.\nUnfortunately this reorganisation and the transitional\narrangements will lead to a costly\nbureaucratic turmoil which will\nin no way help tackle Inner\nLondon's pressing problems\nwith education.\nWhy is this legislation\nneeded?\nTwo principal reasons are given\nfor these reforms. The GLC and\nM CCs are seen as an unnecessary\ntier of government, but this\nclearly cannot apply to ILEA since, as we have seen, an overall\njoint board for the whole of Inner\nurban\ndeprivation\nLondon is to be set up. The major\nreason is the Government's desire to limit local authority\nspending, despite the fact that\nover the last five years ILEA'S budgeted gross expenditure\noverall has dropped by about\n3'/2% in real terms.\nThere are good reasons why\nservices should not be cut to\nprovide greater savings. Education in Inner London costs i more than elsewhere due to the\nhigh prices found in London and\nthe particular social conditions\nexisting. These include a changing population, over-crowding, and a high proportion\nof single pa.wi it families, which\nall contribute to a high level of\nurban deprivation. Schools in\nLondon are particularly old and\ntherefore require more maintenance.\ndangerous\ncentralisation\nFurthermore, claims that\nabolition of the G* LC and M CC's would lead to a significant annual\nsaving have been dismissed by\nCoopers and Lybrand, a highly\nrespected private firm of management consultants.\nWhy this legislation is\nNOT needed\nThe two sets of proposals raise\nfundamental issues of principle.'\nThey limit the right of the local\ncommunity, through its elected\nauthority, to determine rates and\nlevels of services. They remove\ndirect accountability from the\nelectorate and bring about\ndangerous centralisation. They\nare also unpopular, and should\nso serve as a warning to those\nopportunists who wish to tamper\nwith the nature of our democratic\nsystem\n'Conservative ministers who\nduring the Government's first term\nof office were preaching enhanced\naccountability and stronger links\nin local government between the\npayers and providers are now\nproposing to create a string of\nbodies whose decisions, financial\nand political, cannot be\nadjudicated through the ballot\nbox. Instead, they will be subject to\nyet more control and interference\nfrom the centre.'\n\u2014The Financial Times (leading\narticle) 11 October 1983\nPage 121 Wednesday, March 21, 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Refectories\nLast Thursday a3% increase in the price of refectory meals was\nannounced. This is to be on top of a2'/ \u00bb% rise implemented at the\nstart of the season. The increase is based on the rise in price of an\naverage person's groceries and cannot be directly compared to the\nrequirements of a refectory system which purchases in bulk.\nUntil recently the refectories used to lose vast amounts of money\neach year, now due to increased efficiency it now makes a modest\nprofit. These savings have not been taken into account when\ncalculating the price increase.\nThe 3% price increase seems to have been conjured out of thin air\nand has no logical basis. It would have been sensible to base any price\nrise on the current performance of the refectory system. This\nunfortunately is not possible because it takes several months to get\nany useful information out of the refectory accounts. The problem is\nthat the refectory pricing policy is based on guesswork and archaic\naccounting procedures.\n- The Union has been pressing College for years for a proper\nbreakdown of the performance of individual refectories to little avail.\nInstead of brushing aside comments from the Union when College\nare losing the argument they should perhaps take the Union a little\nmore seriously.

Probably because of a long minibus\njourney, IC took a while to get into the game\nand lost the first set. However after a very\nclosely fought second set IC went on to win\nthe match 2-1.\nAfter this, the team were looking forward\nto an early night in readiness for the next\nday's matches. However this was not to be.\nChristos had forgotten his Unioncard and\nhad to return to London to get it, while\neveryone worried if he would make it back in\ntime for the first match on Saturdays.\nOn Saturday morning IC beat York fairly\neasily 2-0, but had a much tougher game in\nthe afternoon against Manchester, eventually\nwinning 2-1. Thus IC came top of their pool\nand were through to the semi-finals.\nThe tournament was organised on a pool\nsystem; there were two pools of four teams\n(winners of their regions), winners and\nrunners-up of each pool go into the semi-finals. Matches were played best of three sets.\nIn Pool 1: IC won and Birmingham were,\nrunners-up, beating Manchester and York.\nIn Pool B: Nottingham, East Anglia,\nLoughborough and Southampton. Southampton (last year's winners) were very\nconfident; Loughborough had a very well\ndrilled and impressive team which included a Polish ex-international. As expected\nLoughborough easily won their pool,\nSouthampton coming second. Thus, IC were\nto meet Southampton in the first semi-final\non Sunday morning.\nSaturday evening was 'quietly' spent in a local public house.\nIn the semi-final, Southampton as last\nyear's champions, were under considerable\npressure to win and thus did not.\nIC's attach ers were especially in good form\nand the match was won 2-0.\nIn the other semi-final Birmingham\nstunned everyone by beating a not in form\nLoughborough team 2-0!\nSo IC were to play Birmingham again; in\nthe final scheduled for 3:00pm in a differ et j sports hall. Birmingham had a lot of vocal\nsupport, especially from their girls team, but\nthey lost the first set 15-3! Dominit Song\nespecially was in devastating form for IC\ndespite injured fingers.\nHowever, IC lost concentration and the\nsecond set. The third set was much more\nclosely fought and went to IC. Birmingham\nwon the fourth after an amazing comeback.\nIn the deciding set, IC got off to a good\nstart\u2014possibly inspired by the enthusiastic\nsupport offered by Speedy Stevie and Mini\nMike from the bench; superior blocking and a more varied attack eventually gave IC the\nfinal set and match.\nThus IC won the title in an amazing first\nentry to the U AU competition, in an exciting\nfive set final.\nHang-gliding champs: Team( L to R back) Dave Evans,\nDave Thomas (front) Mel Burton, Dave Rusby, Karl Briers.\nOn March 3 and 4, the first inter-university\nhang-gliding competition was hosted by\nSwansea University.\nOur Captain, Dave Rushy, went first for\nIC and was only the second person to land in\nthe circle. Our hero, Dave Evans (The Black\nBaron) on his inflatable, went next and\nlanded slap-bang in the centre of the target\nto get maximum points. Closely following\ncame Dave Thomas, Mel Barton and the\nsolid base to our team, Pete 'get on a diet'\nEdwards, who, after relieving themselves of\nlunchtime ballast, all performed incredibly\nwell to boost our points total. Commiserations to Karl, who was about to\ncompete when flying was called off.\nThe IC Team consisted of Dave Rusby,\nDave Evans, Dave Thomas, Mel Barton,\nPete Edwards and Karl Briers. The final-scores of the top three teams were: Imperial\n180 points, Plymouth Poly168 and Manchester Poly .138.\nPage 16J, On Friday 9 March, IC Judo Club went to\nthe UL U building to fight in the annual\ninter-colleges competition.\nThe IC Ladies, Sarah Parker, Caroline\nScott, Kathryn Markham and Gabby Shields set the evening off to a good start.\nThey took the bronze medal in their event.\nThe contests produced some interesting\nJudo, Including a Ju-Jitsu leg-breaking\ntechnique from Caroline.\nIn the men's event, the IC B team Ray\nKowe, Jim Dawson, Paul Mellor and Chris\nDunn drew the hardest teams, including our\nown A team. In spite of the far more\nexperienced opposition, the B team put up a good fight. Ray and Jim did very well\nagainst much higher grades. Despite this,\nthey failed to gain promotion from their\npool.\nThe men's A team, Ian Nevitt, Tim Stockings, Graham West, Andy Binding and\nTerry Corbitt moved into position. The\ncrowd hushed. After some teething trouble\nwith Brunei, the teams from QM C and an\nimpressive \" All stars\" team were suitably\ndispatched. The semi-finals saw LSE dealt\nWMWednesday, March 21, 1984W J M with in a similar fashion. The finals brought\nus up against QMC again, who didn't seem\nto have learnt their lesson from the earlier\nrounds. A quick past-midnight demonstration of Judo reminded them soon enough\nand IC collected gold for the third year\nrunning. Ian and Tim did especially well,\noften'winning against, heavier players. Terry\nalso won all his contests in his own\ninimitable style.\nUL U Athletics Championships Univ of London Union will be staging their\nathletics championships on Tues and Wed 1 and\n2 May (6:30pm start) at Motspur Park. Cost is\n50p per person per event.\nUniversities Athletic Union will be staging\ntheir athletics championships on Sun and Mon\n6 and 7 May (11:00am start) at Crystal Palace.\nAnyone interested in taking part may inspect\nthe timetable of events in the Union Office, and\nshould do so as soon as possible since the entries\nmust be in by 20 April.\nPlease see Ian Bull in the Union Office at\nlunch times for further details.\nI FELIX\n\n"

This form will however\nbe stamped by the DHS S and\nhave an 'excess income' figure\nmarked on it. This figure\ndetermines how much Housing\nBenefit Supplement you will\nreceive above your normal\nStandard Housing Benefit\nentitlement. Your claim will be\ndealt with as a Standard Housing\nBenefit claim (see below), but you\nshould be given priority over\nother Standard Housing Benefit\nclaims and your total rebate will\nbe higher than if you had gone\ndirect to the Housing Authority.\n3. Standard Housing Benefits\nMany of you will hopefully\nalready have submitted claims\nfor rent and rate rebates during\nterm time although many of you\nare probably still awaiting the\nresult of your claim. During the\nshort vacations your official\nweekly income from your grant\nfalls to \u00a324.55, you are also not\nsubject to the term time student\ndeductions from your rent and\nthus the rent and rate rebate\ncalculation should leave you with\na large rebate on your rent and\nrates over the vacation, (less any\namounts for gas and electricity).\nMoreover, this benefit doesn't involve any 'signing on' and can\nbe paid even if you are not staying\nin your term time residence.\nTo Claim (if you have already\nsubmitted a claim): Many of the\nlocal Housing Authorities around the College will automatically reassess students'\nHousing Benefit claims for the\nshort vacations if term dates were\nsubmitted with the original\nclaim. However, the Housing\nBenefit regulations do place a clear responsibility on the\nclaimant to inform the Housing\nAuthority of any changes in\ncircumstances, and there are\nsome authorities (notably\nKensington and Chelsea) who\nwill refuse to reassess your claim\nunless you specifically request a reassessment for the vacation.\nTherefore I would suggest that,\nwhichever your authority, you\nwrite to them now, informing\nthem of your vacation dates,\nreminding them that your\nvacation income from your grant\nis only \u00a324.55 per week,\ninforming them that you will not\nbe working over the vacation (if\nthat is the case) and asking them\nto reassess your claim for those\nweeks.\nTo Claim (for those who haven't yet submitted claims): DO SO\"\nNOW! Forms for Westminster,\nKensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham, Ealing and\nHounslow are available from\nStudent Services, for other\nboroughs visit your local Town\nHall. When you submit your\nform you will need to include\nproof of your grant from your\nLocal Education Authority,\nproof of your rent, ie rent\nbook/rent receipts/letter from\nyour landlord (Student Services if\nyou are in College ac com moda tion) and a note of your term-dates. Remember these claims\ncannot be backdated\u2014if you\nhave not applied by the beginning\nof the vacation you will lose your\nmoney. However, if you do apply\nnow enclosing the term dates and\nmaking it clear you wish to apply\nfor term time and vacation then\nyou should be assessed for both\nperiods.\ni The main disadvantage with\nthis type of benefit is the time it\ncan take for your money to arrive\n\u2022(anything from 1 to 9 months! It\n| is worth keeping in touch with\nyour Housing Authority since\nsome of them have a disconcerting habit of temporarily\n'losing' claims if it can save them\nthe trouble of processing them. If\nyou do have particular difficulties with your claim, call into\nStudent Services and we should\nbe able to help coax authorities\ninto action.\nAlthough all the details in this '\narticle are to the best of my\nknowledge, correct at the time of\ngoing to press, confusion still\nreigns amongst the Housing\nAuthorities and it is quite likely\nthat individual officers at the\nTown Halls may give contradictory advice to students. The\nsafest way to avoid confusion is\nto follow the basic rules outlined\nbelow:\n1. If you are remaining in\nLondon over the vacation 'sign\non' through the DHSS.\n2. If you are leaving London\nfor the vacation use the Standard\nHousing Benefit system.\n3. Return all forms and reply\nto all letters from the Housing\nAuthority promptly and clearly.\n4.

A total of 320 people\nwatched one of the most professional pieces of drama to be seen in\nCollege for some years. There were strong performances from all of\nthe large cast, especially Michael Bridgeland as the lead who was\nrarely off stage. The probe ms caused by the large number of scenes of\nshort length, and also the large number of characters, were\nconvincingly overcome. This allowed the humour and irony of the\nexcellent script to be portrayed to the full by the clear delivery of all\nmembers of the cast, even those in small roles.\nThe quality of the acting was complemented by the specially\nconstructed set. The monolithic concert hall was transformed with\nthe stage being extended by a series of distinct levels, to the floor. By\nenclosing the theatre with black curtains, the atmosphere created by\nthe play was perfectly enhanced. ,\nConsiderable credit must go to all involved in such a complex\nproduction, especially director Matthew Chevassut and the producer\nMark Priestley.

There is no other\nchoice for man.'\nHG Wells(t866 \u20141946).novelist\nand social reformer.gained a free\nstudentship to the Nornal School\nof Sciencejater to become the\nRoyal School of Science.He\nstudied biology under Thomas\nHenry Huxley.who had a great\ninfluence on much of his work\nand ideas.He attended Imperial\nfor four years.During this time\nhis work,originally brilliant,\nbecame steadily worse, until,\ndisillusioned with his Professor,\nhe failed his geology finals. He\nbecame a strong critic of Imperial\nCollege.\nWells believed in social and\nscientific interests being catered\nfor inside the College system, he\nwrote:\n'There is an in era dic able tendency in sound technology to\ngo on to purely scientific interest\nand breadth of social thought,\nthe higher centres will keep on\nbreaking through, and South\nKensington, in spite of itself, does\na great deal of read University\nwork and makes men of many of\nits technicians. But so far the\nrecognition of this tendency in\nany organised form has been \u00ab\nsuccessfully resisted.'\nIn the Beginning\nIn January 1963 the first move\nto form a society based on this\nMany students at Imperial College have no idea of what\nWellsoc is, and why it exists. The HG Wells Society of Imperial\nCollege was founded twenty years ago this session, to conquer\nignorance, broaden people's horizons and release them from\nthe narrow confines of academic life.\nidea, was made; Sinclair Goodlad\nMA wrote to the president of the\nNational HG Wells Society\nasking their permission to use\nWells' name for the new society.\nHG Wells was chosen as the\n'patron saint' of the society\nbecause of all Imperial College\nalumni, his interests most nearly\ncoincided with those of the\nsociety but '...he is our excuse\nrather than our motive.'\nAims\nBroadly speaking the HG Wells\nSociety\u2014Wellsoc for short\u2014has\nthree main aims. Firstly, it aims\nto give students in the various\ndepartments an opportunity to\nhear about interesting work\nbeing undertaken in the fields of\nscience and technology other\nthan their own.\nSecondly, it explores the\ninteraction between the\ndiscoveries of science and the life\nof the community, and hence the'\n'shape of things to come'.\nThirdly, it will examine\nsubjects which are on the\nborderline between science\nfiction and science fact.\nAfter the Beginning\nMembership of the society grew\nfrom 1963 onwards under the\npresidency of first Sinclair\nGoodlad MA( now Dr Goodlad\nEE), then Lord Jackson of\nFeature\nattendances of 950 and membership reaching 1,150,\nmaking it the largest society in\nthe University of London.\nFor four years membership\nremained high (900 in 1974),\nhowever in 1979 membership\nhad fallen into single figures and\nunder the unenthusiastic chairmanship of Frank James,\nthe society collapsed.\nIn 1981 the society was\nrelaunched, with Prof Eric\nLaithwaite (EE) as president, by a hard core, including Pallab\nGhosh (Chairman). The first\nissue of the 'Wellsian'\u2014paper of\nWellsoc\u2014appeared soon after.\nMembership increased to\napproximately 550.\nLecutres have always been\nheld on Monday evenings at\n7:30pm hence the society slogan\n'Monday Night is Wellsoc Night'.\nLectures were varied, ranging\nAn extract from a letter received\nfrom Arthur C Clarke.\nBurnley. Sir Barnes Wallis CBE FRS gave the opening lecture of\nthe session 1968-69 on 'The\nStrength of England' which\npacked out the Great Hall. He\nwas invited to become president\nin 1970, after the death of Lord\nJackson; he accepted and\nreturned in October to lecture\non 'The General Trend in\nTransport'.\nThis lecture was the peak in\nthe society's history with\nHYPNOTISM\n1\n\" YOU WILL BE THERE!'\nMARTIN S.

The event was expected to\nhave a large attendance and was held in Mech Eng 220 to cope.\nfrom 'Relativity', 'Science for\nCrime' to 'Gambling' and ' An Anatomy of Laughter', many by\nwell known people. Dr Magnus\nPyke, Yuhudi Menuhin, Michael\nBentine and Prof Sir Herman\nBondi. The lectures were-supplemented by film showings\nincluding 'Freaks' a film banned\nfrom England for thirty years,\nand Village of the Damned a film\nbased on John Windham's 'Midwich Cuckoos'.\nStudy Groups\nMany specialised groups were\nset up in the society, such as\nUFOs, ghosts, and the electronic\nmusic group, to study in detail\ntheir own subjects. Some of\nthese groups formed into\nsocieties when Wellsoc collapsed\nin 1979\u2014Graffitti, and Science\nFiction Society which are still in\nexistance today.\nThe Future\nNext year the society has once\nagain an enthusiastic committee,\nif a little inexperienced, and\nlectures have started on Monday\nevenings, on a regular basis.\nPerhaps the society will again\nbecome 'THE' society in Imperial\nCollege.\nFELIXl {Wednesday, March 21, 1984 I Page 13\n\n"

The decision was announced by Dr Simon Perry,\nrefectory committee chairman, during last Thursday's refectory\ncommittee meeting.\nIn recent yea Vs, rete c tory prices have been linked to the Financial\nTimes shopping basket index, an indication of the amount of money\nan average housewife spends on food each week. Over the last twelve\nmonths the index has risen by about 7%. Since food costs account for\nabout 45% of the price of a refectory meal, College officials have\ndecided that a3% price rise is required.\nEarlier this year the Union agreed to a price rise of 2%%\nand a formal dinner price rise of 53\n/4% as a result of wage rises. The aim\nof this was that prices for students should not go up by more than 4%,\nthe student grant increase. College now say that a further 3% rise for\none term wi'1\nmean that students will have payed less in total than had\nthey been faced with a4% rise at the start of the year.\nThe Union feel, though, that the current system for assessing when\nprice rises are needed is irrelevant and illogical. In their view the price\nof food purchased for a university catering operation cannot be linked\ndirectly to the price an average housewife pays for her shopping.\nThe Union believe that a better system, based on the new\ncomputerised accounting system that Mr Mooney is trying to install,\ncould be used.\nThe index used to gauge inflation is not the only thing that the Union\nobjects to, though. In their view the price rise is not necessary because\nof improvements in efficiency that have taken place. The Union\nbelieves that the savings made over the last few years have not been\npassed on to consumers.\nOne example of such savings is a large purchase of pre-cooked meals ,\nmade recently. These meals were sold to College cheaply, to dispose of\na discontinued range. However the only price cut that has been\npromised by Mr Mooney, so far, is 15p off the price of chicken curry in\nthe Union Bar.\nThe most recent argument about refectory prices is part of a broader\nargument about the financing of refectories. The Refectory\nSubcommittee chairmen, including Union sabbatical officers and a member of the academic staff have been continually pressing the\nCollege refectory system to produce more useful financial\ninformation. In past years no information relevant to individual bar\nand refectory outlets has been available. Without such information it\nis difficult to imagine how College have been able to make informed\nmanagement decisions with the refectory system. In the most recent\nargumentative discussion, ICU Deputy President, Christine Teller\nasked what the objectives of the refectory system were. At present,\nCollege appear to be uncertain as to whether each refectory and bar\noutlet should function on a break even basis, whether the overall\ncollege catering should break even or whether the bars should\n>\nAnti-porn demonstrators outside the JCR.\nWednesday.

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nDIAL M FOR\nPRESIDENT\nCollege Secretary Mr John Smith has given his support, in\nprinciple, for the Union to run the Union Lower Refectory next\nyear. The refectory will be run by a newly appointed Catering\nManager who will be answerable to the Deputy President and a catering committee consisting of student representatives and a staff treasurer. meeting it will then be referred\nFor the past two years the to the Rector's Policy\nUnion Refectory has been\ngenerally acknowledged to be\nthe worst of all the College's refectories. More complaints\nabout the quality of food have\nbeen received from the Union\nRefectory than any other, and\nit has been making a loss for\nsome time. Until the Union's proposal had been put\nforward, it had been\nsuggested that the Union\nRefectory should be closed\nand the Lounge Bar would be\nextended to cope with the\nextra demand for food.\nThe plans were revealed to\nMr Smith yesterday morning\nby IC Union President\nGaynor Lewis and Deputy\nPresident Christine Teller. In\nan interview with FELIX, Mr Smith described the Union's proposal as 'well thought out\nand well documented'. He also said that the success\nof the bookshop and re fec' tories in other Student Unions\nshowed that there was no\nreason why IC Union should\nnot run a refectory success-fully. However, he said that he\nhad reservations about the\nfact that sabbaticals would\nchange each year and that this\nwould be a weakness.\nThe plans will now be\nconsidered at the next\nrefectory committee meeting.\nIf the idea is approved at the\nNO 671 MkwmmakWBaww\nCommittee for final approval.\nPlans to take over had been\ndrawn up as early as August\nlast year by Miss Teller and\nMiss Lewis. Lack of adequate\nfinancial data about the\nindividual refectory outlets\nprevented a proper case being\nprepared and the plan was\nshelved. However there was\nlittle improvement in the\nquality of food and it was\ndecided to press ahead with\nthe takeover early this term.\nChristine Teller, Gaynor\nLewis and Hugh Southey,\nInternal Services Chairman\ndrafted a. revised document\nfor a takeover. This was then\napproved at a recent ISC\nmeeting by all the sabbaticals.\nIf the refectory is to be\nunder Union control next year\nit will be run as a fast food\nsnack bar, serving pies,\npasties, beef burgers and a wide range of sandwiches.\nHowever plans have not been\nfinalised. If College gives\npermission, a wide sample of\nstudent views will be sought\nabout type of food that should\nbe served.\nThe proposed date for the\nhandover is 31st July. This is\ndesigned to coincide with the\nend of the college's trading\nyear. The Union will aim to\nstart serving at the start of\nSeptember.\n\" \u2022 HH H FELIX.

Miss\nAnderson, who is pictured above, says her main policy\nfor Guilds is to involve more people in the union's activities. Last nigH she showed that she was not just a pretty face by finishing off a yard of beer in the Union\nBar.\nThe election result was somewhat of a surprise as it\nhad been widely believed that Steve Nixon would be\nelected. Ian Joesbury was the other candidate for\nPresident.\nGuilds Union had 28 people standing for seven posts\non their executive. As a result, the elections went on late\ninto the afternoon.\nIn the other elections, Ian Joesbury was elected VicePresident and Simon Chamberlain was elected Hon Sec.\n21 1984 H liH H****H H H*i^^ Free!\n\n"

With the\nprice of a pint down 12pa pint\nand free paper cups(3p each), at\nleast 15p was being thrown\naway for every pint served. It\nhas been calculated that over\n7,000 pints were sold giving a loss in takings of around\n\u00a31,200. The paper cups used\ncontain about 1.0501 pints\ncompared to that put in glasses\nof around 0.95 pint (including\nhead). This increases the loss\nmade to around about \u00a31,500.\nMost of which went to the\nhundreds of outsiders present\nwith little benefit to IC stu-dents. The paper cups are a severe problem, I know glasses\ncannot be used but a better\nsystem or different containers\nshould be employed. I know it is\nimpossible to fill the cups to a pint as I have some experience\nin this matter. At a time when\nrefectories make losses to be\nsub sidi sed by the bars Mr Mooney is throwing away vast\nsums of money.

    "content": "YI HEaVY II QI EE ORT LINE THEATRE Set in those halcyon days of the late 1920s where for the upper-crust, life was a heady\nmixture of tennis, and bright young things,\n'Mr Cinders is a light-hearted musical\ncomedy. The Cinders of the piece is Jim, the\ndespised 'poor relative' of the Lancasters,\nwho drudges for them in return for his keep.\nHis luck changes when he falls in love with a millionaire's daughter, disguised as a housemaid in the establishment. Meanwhile he has\nto contend with the Lancasters: Aunt\nAgatha, stout snobbish termagant who'\nhenpecks her pleasant, but ineffectual,\nhusband, and Jim's cousins\u2014the odiously\nsmug Lumley, and the twit tish Guy. There\nare several twists and turns in the plot,\nincluding a fancy-dress ball, a jewel robbery\nand various thwarted romances; but in the\ntime-honoured manner, all ends happily.\nThe period atmosphere is one of this\nmusical's more engaging features. It was\nrevived last year at the Kings Head Theatre\nand is now enjoying a successful run at the\nFortune. The play was first performed in\n1929, however some of the humour has not\naged well, but otherwise its setting is\nwelcome escapism. Touches of the 20s include the ensemble number ' On With\nDance' where the cast perform a brisk\nCharleston, with nice precision. The songs\nare generally good with the snappy rhythms\nof the period, though are sometimes\ninadequately supported by weak singing.\nPerhaps the best, if certainly the best-known,\nis 'Spread a Little Happiness' which has been\npopularised by the rock artist Sting in recent\nyears.\nLonnie Donegan makes a a splendid Mr Cinders, if somewhat over-mature at first\nsight (is love this blind?), bringing a finely-judged warmth and humour to the part.\nChristina Mathews as his partner, has a pert\ncharm and a clear true voice.\nIn conclusion Mr Cinders is worth seeing if\nyou like this type of show, and can bear the\nodd old joke and occasionally uneven pace.\nPoint to note: Don't go to matinee s, unless\neither you like children or are prepared to put\nup with the sound of little mouths munching\npeanuts and singing along with Lonnie\nDonegan, during the performance.\n\"Loving Couples?-It takes all sorts.\nChristina Mathews and Dennis\nLawson in 'Mr Cinders' (right) Tom Bell\nand Lynn Farleigh in 'The Man Who Fell\nin Love with his Wife' (far right).\nFELIX\nRents by Michael Wilcox at the Lyric\nTheatre, Hammersmith.\nA play of raw wit and humour, Rents\nprovides a sympathetic insight into the lives\nand loves of a homosexual couple in\nEdinburgh. Phil, the elder of the pair and the\ndominant partner is a drama student; while\nRobert, a support-seeking 18 year old who\nworks as an assistant in a local boutique. To\nsupplement their meagre income, they resort\nto pilfering goods and acting as part-time\n'rent-boys' or male prostitutes.\nDespite their infidelities and open\npromiscuity, theirs is a relationship of mutual\ndependence if not of trust. They share their\ncheap bed sitter contentedly, until Phi! casts\nhis attentions on to Richard, a visit, ig college\nlecturer from Newcastle. When he is invited\nback to the flat, his influence, and the\ninsecurity and suspicions of the pair, start to\nsplit the couple up.\nMichael Wilcox's play never judges, but\nonly reveals, the sometimes sordid reality of\nthis Edinburgh sub-culture. Realism is added\nby a street-plan in the program, detailing the\nvarious locations, and a backdrop silhouette\nof Edinburgh itself.\nSimply and effectively staged, the lighting\nis cleverly used to highlight characters, or\ncentres of action. A few chairs make a cafe,\nthen with the addition of a bed, the flat itself.\nSome people might feel the subject matter, or\nits physical and verbal explicitness in\npresentation, inherently distasteful; but it\nwould be a shame to avoid this multi-faceted\nplay for these reasons.\nThe Lyric Theatre Hammersmith offers\nexcellent value for students, with tickets\ncost ingly only \u00a31.50 for Saturday matinee s and book able in advance. Highly convenient\nfor all Hamlet Gdns dwellers too, being only a ten minute walk away.\nClaire Moss\nWednesday, March 21, 1984\nThe Man Who Fell In Love With His Wife\nby Ted Whitehead at the Lyric Studio.\nThis new version of Ted Whitehead's television drama 'Sweet Nothings' stems\ntrom an original idea from about three years\nago. Since then it has been 'extensively\nrewritten' for the small studio below the\nLyric's main theatre.\nThe production centres around Tom\nFearnon's relationship with his wife, Mary.\nAn under loved and thereby intensely jealous\nman, Fearnon hounds his wife in an attempt\nto uncover an affair between her and a male\nwork colleague, which he is convinced is\ntaking place. The inevitable separation which\nfollows drives Fearnon towards a nervous\nbreakdown. Coupled with financial\ndifficulties due to his inability to hold his job,\nhe is impelled to seek psychiatric help, which\nin turn, leads to a reunion with his wife.\nAs a play adapted from the small screen to\nthe stage it is surprisingly un dynamic. Separation and divorce are two well hacked\nthemes in television drama and it is difficult to\ncreate an impact on a screen-dulled audience\nunless the two parties actually come to\nblows. Although it has been reworked\nspecially for the stage, the production still has\nits former air about it, but its intensity is lost.\nThis is unfortunate because the well designed\nset and the physical size of the Lyric Studio\nallows a high level of intimacy between\naudience and actors. All the cast have much\nexperience in TV work, and all are fairly\nfamiliar faces, although Anna Lindup's performance of the couple's daughter is\nperhaps a little too well acted in the light of\nher objective role in Whitehead's play.\nThe show runs until 24 March. Those who\nsaw the original version for television three\nyears ago are unlikely to find any differences\nin the reworked stage play other than\ncosmetic changes. But if you have not yet\nseen the production, then I can recommend\nit as an involved if perhaps uninspired look at\nthe problems of middle aged marriage.\nJohn Burgess\nB^ HMM HH^ Ha^H H nR Page 8\n\n"

Certified Housing Benefit is available only to those receiving\nSupplementary Benefit whilst\nHousing Benefit Supplement is\navailable to those who narrowly\nmiss qualifying for Supplementary Benefit.\nThe vacation element in the\nundergraduate grant (currently\n\u00a324.55) is designed to be roughly\nequivalent to the single persons\n'non-householder' rate of\nSupplementary Benefit thereby\npreventing the majority of students from being eligible for\nSupplementary Benefit in the\nshort vacations.

There is also a classification known as 'joint\nhouseholder' which applies to\nthose who share their household\n; expenses with others eg, a group\nsharing a flat. In practical terms,\nfor the short vacations, those\nwho share their 'household' with\nno more than one o the F person\nmay be entitled to a small weekly\nsum from the DHSS.\nTo claim: Go down to your\nlocal Unemployment Benefit\nOffice on the first weekday of the\nvacation and 'sign on' as unemployed and available for work. If\nyou are not eligible for\nUnemployment Benefit (see\nabove) then your papers will\nautomatically be passed on to the\nlocal Supplementary Benefit\nOffice (DHSS).
