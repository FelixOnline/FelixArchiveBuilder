    "content": "KARATE\nHi ho silver\nDawn last Saturday saw twenty of our\nenthusiastic if weary-eyed squad\nmembers and supporters boarding a coach together with Caesar Andrews\n(3rd dan) bound for the National\nStudent Championships at Keele.\nGuest celebrities at the event included\nBritain's top instructor Andy Sherry\n(6th dan) and Frank Brennan British\nand European Grand Champion (4th dan).\nAlthough it was cold and frosty at\nsix in the morning spirits were still\nhigh after last week's successes at the\nPortsmouth Invitation Tournament.\nBy ten o 'clock most of the\nparticipating universities and\npolytechnics, nine in all, had\nassembled and the seventeen teams\nwere, desperately trying to warm up\nin the sub-zero temperatures.\nThe competition kicked off in more\nways than one with the men's team\nkumi te. Both of our teams fought well\ndisplaying strong technique and good\nspirit. The A team (P Urbana, K Sayers, A Kerley, 0 Kawaji, R Newton, S Taylor and O Abbosh)\nsucceeded in fighting through to win\nthe bronze trophy only being stopped\nby the eventual National Champions,\nWolverhampton.\nThe squad's next successes were\ngained in the ladies' individual\nkum it e:J Spicer easily taking the\nsilver and S Lindberg battling through\nto collect the bronze. The men's individual kumi te turned out to be\nquite a challenge. S Kawaji reached\nthe quarter finals with very creditable\nperformances also coming from K Sayers, P Urbana and J Rogers.\nAs the remainder of the competition\nprogressed it became clear that\ndespite 'extraordinary efforts' in the\nkata sections last week's splendid total\nof ten trophies was not be be beaten.\nCambridge University, the highest\nfunded of all the squads, once again\ndisplayed how much they have\nbenefitted from recent trips abroad\nincluding Japan, by retaining the\nNational Team Kata Championships.\nTomorrow sees the start of the\nBritish Universities Karate\nChampionship held at the National\nSports Centre, Crystal Palace. A predominantly IC team (13 out of 20)\ncoached by Imperial's instructor\nCaesar Andrews will be representing\nthe whole of London University.\nThe squad would like to thank\nCaesar for his dedication to Shotakan\nkarate at Imperial.\nBADMINTON\nSean wins a rubber\nSport:\nCROSSCOUNTRY Tearing down\nThe usual collection of IC Badminton\nmega stars arrived at Nottingham\nUniversity on Friday evening to do\nbattle once more in this annual event.\nThere was a little more at stake this\nyear since everyone would have liked\nto repeat the triumph our first ladies\npair had last year\u2014they became\nladies' doubles champions!\nThe first events were the men's and\nladies' singles where a few surprises\nwere in store, and no one was more\nsurprised than Sean who won a rubber\nto reach the second round. That was\nhis lot though! Trevor did remarkably\nwell to win 2 and reach the third\nround where he was narrowly beaten\nby a county player from Leicester\nUniversity. The best performances in\nthe singles however came from Uta.\nShe reached the last 16 where she\nunfortunately came up against the\nnumber 2 seed from Birmingham.\nIn the ladies' doubles Julie (half of\nthe championship pair from last year)\nand Uta strode through to the quarter\nfinals where they met the top seeds,\nand eventual winners, from\nLoughborough. In the men's doubles\ntwo pairs played through two rounds\neach before being defeated. Sean and\nSimon had a tremendously narrow\nvictory over a pair from Liverpool\nbefore being out-manoeuvre d by the\ntop pair from UCI( boasting the\nrunner-up in the men's singles).\nBhavot and Trevor, on the other hand\nhad more convincing victories and\nmanaged to reach the last 16 by virtue\nof having a bye through to the second\nround.\nIn the mixed doubles everyone lost.\nEnough said!!\nThe weekend was the usual mix of\ngood badminton, good company,\nplenty of nervous tension, and great\nfun, and I'm sure everyone enjoyed\nthemselves. The finals were some of\nthe best I have ever seen at U AU( especially the ladies' singles) and it\nwas particularly nice to see a Brunei\npair win the mixed, rather than the\nLoughborough's and Nottingham's of\nthis world.\nMORE RUGBY\nBrums Drum RCS\nRCS l st XV12 Birmingham University 4th XV \u2014 2 8\nOn Wednesday (18th) morning the\nRCS Rugby Squad and a set of shirts\ngathered in Beit Quad for their annual\nfixture in Birmingham.\nThe coach left late and arrived even\nlater with just 15 mins before kick off.\nCaptain Pert and Spock had problems\nwith their navigational equipment.\nThe first team started one man\nshort. Despite dropping the ball on the\nline, the captain's boot put us into an\nearly lead which we retained until\nearly in the second half. The second\nhalf we played into the wind and lost\nHOCKEY\nConvincing loss\nIC l sts1 Southgate Adelaide 5\nOn Saturday, IC l sts played unbeaten\nSouthgate Adelaide in the Middlesex\nleague. Adelaide, the home side, were\nevidently well prepared for the top-of-the-league clash and quickly took\nthe lead from a brilliant short corner\nroutine. Due to IC's slack hockey and\nlack of discipline, the club side scored\na further four goals before the inter-touch with the 'hackers'. Then out of\nthe blue midway through the half\nDave Wilson barged his way through\nfor a well deserved try. This recovery\nsaw the back row linking with the\nbacks well in the loose. Notable\nperformers C Owen, Tubby Wilson,\nS Fairhead, Bryn, Boyce and Spock'Bardiver'-Dobson. It was in this\nperiod of RCS domination that Spike\nBoyce was brought down brutally and\nhad to leave the field. The game then\njust seemed to slip away and before\nwe knew it they had scored two in the\ncorner to seal the game.\nval. Having lost the game in the first\n35 minutes, IC started afresh in the\nsecond. Despite coming out 1-0 winners in that period, IC lost the match\nconvincingly on goal difference. If IC\nare to win the honours that they are\ncapable of this year, they will have\nto approach their matches with a much more professional attitude.\nWe've had two more outings and both\nwith good turnouts I'm pleased to say.\nAt the London Colleges League in\nBattersea Park we had 16 runners\nmaking three full teams (and Jane).\nThe course was over a flat 10km course consisting 3 laps of a2 mile\ncircuit. The course has previously\nbeen used for the AAA Championship. Performances of note\ncame from Bubertus Schulte-Huxel\n(22nd) and Mark Ashby (26th). Our next race was at the\nWhitenights Relays in Reading. We again had three teams entered and\nwith good selection the teams were\nfielded according to anticipated\nperformances. In a very strong field\nof 80 teams, and over a fast 2 lh mile\ncourse around the campus of Reading\nUniversity, our first team did well to\nshow in the top 25 teams with the\nsecond and third teams following\nclosely behind. Many thanks to our\npresident Professor Inman for his\nsupport at this and other races this\nterm. Thanks also to those in the team\nwho suggested we should have a tour\nof Reading after the race. Most\nenjoyable!\nFinally, I have to mention the\nUniversity of London Championships, tomorrow Saturday\nDecember 5. As a result of some\nmindless individuals tearing notices\nfrom our board the list of people for\nthis race was missing for some time\nbefore a new one was made up.

He\nhas inspired close\ninspection of codes\nof etiquette which\nevery Imperial\nstudent should\nknow and observe\nat formal dinners.\nCollege for Etiquette\nIn the outside world, whether rightly\nor wrongly, it may be necessary to\nknow how to behave properly at\nformal occasions in order to get on\nin life, commented Mr Howgate. He\nsees this as being part of all round\neducation of College students.\nSo here are a few guidelines for the\nnext formal dinner:\nDress\nGentlemen \u2014The ticket for the dinner\nwill usually indicate the type of dress\nwhich is acceptable. 'Black tie' will\nrequire a dinner jacket, black tie,\ntrousers and shoes. A dark lounge suit\nmay be also worn at such occasions\nalthough this would usually be\nindicated on the ticket. 'Tails' self-evidently means tails are necessary.\nOccasionally at a formal dinner\ncoloured bow ties may be worn but\nthey must be dark (sorry Ian, no pink\nwith yellow dots).\nLadies\u2014A short dress is acceptable\nfor a 'black tie dinner' although a long\ndress will be needed for a 'tails'\ndinner. Ladies should never go to a dinner almost topless, at a dinner\ndance a strapless dress may be worn,\nbut at the meal a stole or shawl must\nalso be worn.\nBefore the meal one should stand\nbehind the chair until grace has been\nsaid (this is more likely to occur in\nthe outside world than at a College\ndinner). If taking a lady, then pull her\nchair out and push it back before\nsitting down yourself.\nAt the end of the meal and generally\nafter the speeches there will be a toast\nto the Queen. Between the start of the\nmeal and the loyal toast you should\nnot get out of your chair unless\nabsolutely necessary. Also do not take\noff articles of clothing (eg jackets,\nties) or undo top buttons.\nPassing the Port\nThe loyal toast is made with the port\nso don't drink it before the toast. The\nport is passed clockwise (ie to the left)\naround the table. Operate the decanter\nwith the left hand. If serving the lady\nto your left (there is some d is uc s sion as to whether it is necessary to pour\nout a lady's port for her, so this may\nnot be needed) then serve her first and\npass the port around her back. Ideally\nthe port should never touch the table,\na glass, or the right hand.\nAt the end of the meal leave\nwhenever everyone else starts to\nleave, and if taking a lady pull her\nchair out for her. If members of the\nacademic staff are still sitting then\nexcuse yourself.\nA Major\nSoftware\nHouse\nWhatever your degree if you would\nlike to know more about\nInformation Systems\nopportunities with BP,\nyou are invited to come and\ntalk with us at\n6 p.m. on Thursday,\n10th December 1987\nin\nThe Chemical Engineering SCR\n(behind the College Bookshop)\nImperial College.\nRefreshments, careers literature\nand advice will be available.\n10 Friday 4th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

It must have been really\nterrible being stuck down in\nGuildford for nearly four days. I wouldn't like to be stuck in Guildford\nfor even one hour.\nFor all of you who did witness\nTuesday'sU GM, it is easy to see that\ndecisions are made not on the validity\nof an argument but because of sheer\nnumbers of people who wouldn't normally attend aUG M but come\nbecause they have an interest in a motion.

He agreed. Our reasons\nwere purely that we believed that\nrather than criticising the lack of\npublicity for UG Ms we would do\nsomething about it. So we spent our\nweekend designing and printing 200\nday-g lo posters which were duly\ndelivered to the Hon Sec at 10am on\nMonday morning. By Tuesday\nlunchtime there was one poster up in\nthe Union Office and one which I put\nup in the F ELK Office, I suggest mat\nMr Jackson should pay the \u00a330 they\ncost the Union to produce.\nSecondly, he rang up on Monday\nasking if we could save him a space\non the Union page for a report. I'm \"still waiting for the report and the\nUnion page was printed on\nWednesday.

    "content": "Wish You Were Here\nTwo notable debuts are made in one\nof the hits of this year's Cannes Film\nFestival, Wish You Were Here. One\ncan quite understand why Emily\nLloyd, the sixteen year old star of the\nfilm (and only just sixteen when it was\nmade), has aroused so much media\ninterest, and since become something\nof a celebrity. Quite apart from her\nslightly unusual tomboyish good\nlooks, she gives a performance of\nastounding maturity for one so\ninexperienced. Credit must also go to\nactor/writer David Leland, here\ndirecting for the first time, who has\ncreated the realistic a if d interesting\ncharacter played by Lloyd and,\naround her, a closely observed picture\nof postwar provincial Britain.\nLynda is growing up in a small\nconservative and close-knit seaside\ntown, which she finds unrelentingly\nboring, and where she cannot hold\ndown a job due to her rather tactless\nlack of self control. She lives with her\nstiff-lipped, petty-minded father and\nyounger sister. Her mother, the only\nreal symbol of love in her life, having\ndied when she was young. The\nrelationship with her father is\nimportant for he is totally incapable\nof handling or understanding his\nheadstrong and sharp-mouthed\nteenage daughter, and the resulting\nlack of affection is clearly one of the\nmajor aspects affecting Lynda's personality. Confusing sex with\naffection she drifts through a series\nof encounters until she meets Eric,\nconvincingly played by Tom Bell, a friend of her fathers and local cinema\nprojectionist, who sees that he can\nabuse Lynda's innocence. Her life is\nthrown into further disarray when she\nbecomes pregnant by Eric, and the\nrest of the film is devoted to the\ndilemma she feels about the child.\nWish You Were Here is simply an\nex erp t from Lynda's life and certainly\ndoesn't attempt to answer any\nquestions, which I thought made the\nending rather weak. However, what\nmakes the film special is undoubtedly\nthe character of Lynda. She has a heartwarming combination of innocence with cheeky rebel io us ness, exemplified by her constant use of\nsemi-rude insults like \"cock off and\n\"up yer bum\", that could only occur\nin an adolescent girl. But she also has\nare s ili ance and intelligence that gives\nthe film a note of optimism.\nBoth Leland and Lloyd are to be\ncongratulated, Wish You Were Here\ncertainly deserves the amount of\nacclaim it has recently received and,\nif it is a true reflection of their talents,\nI look forward to their next projects.\nK.A. MUSIC^\nHowlin'Wilf and the Veejays\nNot much to be said really. If you\nwere there you will have enjoyed two\nhours of sweaty excitement. If you\nweren't, you missed the best way to\nspend a pound on Thursday night.\nThe band appeared late\u2014as is\nusual\u2014but with a better excuse than\nsome others (they had to be torn away\nfrom the quiz in the Snack Bar). All the members played with talent and\nenthusiasm to create a compulsive\nrhythm. They are not the sort of band\nto have any major recording success,\nbut then again who wants to listen to\nthis sort of music being played by\nyour local medallion man DJ or even\nin the comfort of your own squat? It's hard to have any desire to trek halfway across London and pay\nsomething around \u00a34 when bands of\nthe same calibre appear in the Lounge\non an almost weekly basis for a fraction of the cost.\nIf you weren't there, give yourself\na hefty kick and turn up for Real\nSounds of Africa on Thursday.\nR.C. Kotcheff, Aaron\nRupert Clayton\nThomas Greig\nAidan Kershaw\nB00K$=\nGoing Solo\nby Roald Dahl\nRoald Dahl is undisputed ly an\nexcellent storyteller but he should\nnever be judged by television\nproductions of his work. Television\nonly shows the content of his writing,\nand misses his masterful control of the\nEnglish language.\nHowever, having said that, Going\nSolo certainly does not rely solely on\ngood writing as Mr Dahl has squeezed\nmore of interest into the three years\nthis book recounts than others fit into\na life time. One starts off with an\ninsight into colonial types as the\nauthor travels to pre-war Tanzania,\nbut we are not permitted long to dwell\non that before the war breaks out and\nhe is seconded into the army. Before\njoining the. RAF he almost dies in a crash before even seeing the enemy,\nthen with no air combat experience\nhe is thrown in at the deep end. Of course we know he survived and this\nmeans we can look forward to another\nvolume of his full and varied life\nbeing published.\nUnlike other autobiographies which\nseem to be merely blowing the\nauthors' own trumpets, Roald Dahl,\nwho does have every right to show\noff the life he has led, tells his story\nwith absolute modesty that is a delight\nto read, and should be read by\neveryone.\nPublished by Penguin at \u00a33.50.\nT.G. THEAWE\nKiss Me Kate\n(RSC at the Old Vic)\nThey say that Kiss Me Kate is Cole\nPorter's best musical, and has been\nseen almost non-stop by audiences\nsince its first performance in late\nDecember 1984. After sitting through\nthe RSC's production, it is easy to see\nwhy.\nIt opened in January 1987 and\ncontains not only all the standard\n'musical' offerings: lavish sets,\nchorus numbers, solos and duets, but\nalso ref e shing attempts at innovation\nin the direction, design and\nchoreography. This is amply\nexhibited in the first number Another\nOp 'nin, Another Show, where chorus\nmembers provide their own illumination, with small hand-held\nlights, creating a delightful spectacle\nand proving that the RSC's wealth of\ntalent extends to dancing and singing\nas well as acting.\nThe story concerns a production of\nThe Taming of the Shrew starring\nFred Graham (James Smillie) and the\nlegendary Lilli Vanessi (ex-wife of\nMr Graham). Their bickering onstage (helped by the Bard) is mild\ncompared to the exchanges off-stage,\nwhere no help is needed. The 'play-within-a play' seemed the weak point\nof the evening. The costumes and\nacting were (we take it) purposefully\nover the top, but unfortunately the\nactors let it become a little too much.\nThe story started to fade and one\nbecame slightly more aware of the\nsets and lights. But help was at hand\nin the guise of songs including the\nbrilliantly delivered / Hate Men by\nKate (alias Lilli Vanessi, portrayed by\nNichola McAuliffe) although they\ndidn't quite blot out the memory.\nAs with so many musicals, the\nsecond half heralded the beginning of\nthe end, the sub-plots started to\nconclude and the main plot was\nslowing down. But just as this was\nbecoming noticeable on came the\nga nster s( their relevance to the plot\nbeing a little too complex to mention\nhere) and we were treated to\nundoubtedly the best number of the\nevening in Brush Up Your\nShakespeare. Fitting Corialanus,\nRomeo and Juliet et al into rhyming\ncouplets is not easy, but Mr Porter\ngave us both pace and humour with\nthe most delightful of subjects.\nHe's been described as the best\nsongwriter this century, and a trip to\nsee this very enjoyable musical, will\nmake you see why.\nA.K.

    "content": "The Marathon Man\nWhy did Chas Brereton miss the Hypnosis lecture last year? Why does he want to become\na merchant banker this year? Is this article just more blatant self-publicity? Read on to\nfind out just what it's like to play lift music for 40 hours!\nIntroduction*\nIf you were in the J CR on Tuesday\n17th or Wednesday 18th November\nthen you would have heard music\u2014\nbut not of the usual IC Radio variety!\nInstead, you would have heard what\nhas been described as 'Interesting\nCocktail Music' . For the third year\nrunning, I played the piano for 40\nhours during Rag Week. This article\nis intended to give an insight into how\nthis event has run for the past 3 years.\nWhere did it all\nstart?\nI first had the idea of doing a piano\nmarathon in 1984, when I came to IC.\nI had heard about Rag Week and the\nvarious events taking place including the 1,000,001 down darts\nmarathon. I considered that a sponsored piano-marathon would be\nan ideal way for me to get involved\nwith Rag at IC. Unfortunately, I did\nnot know enough about Rag or the\nway the Union worked to organise the\nevent that year. The next year,\nhowever, I was able to ask John\nIngham (Rag Chairman 85/86) to help\nme organise it.\nI started collecting sponsorships\namongst friends in my department and\namongst members of the various clubs\nand societies to which I belonged. I also approached Dep Reps and asked\nthem to take sponsorship forms to the\nstudents in their respective\ndepartments. The event itself took\nplace in a notable absence of publicity\nin the most unlikely of venues: the\nBrown Committee room at the top of\nthe Union Building. In fact, it nearly\ndidn't happen at all; at 5.55am the\nBeit Quad Security guard. was\nsearching frantically for the keys to\nthe OpSoc room so I could get in and\nuse their piano!\nIn spite of the lack of publicity and\nthe teething problems encountered\nwith any event that takes place for the\nfirst time, I raised \u00a3401.50 that year.\n1986\u2014things get a bit better...\nLast year I was determined to get\nmyself organised well before the\nmarathon. I needed a better venue, for\na start. The Sherfield foyer was\nsuggested as the place which has the\nmost people passing through it daily,\nbut Security would have none of that.\nSo Is et ded on the J CR.I was able\nto borrow Rob Northey's piano (used\nfor refectory functions). The other\nmain consideration was getting\nsponsorships. I had been booked to\nplay the piano at some of the Guilds\nFresher's Buffets early in the term,\nso I took advantage of this to get\nsponsorships from those present. This\naccounted for the bulk of the\nsponsorships obtained. During the\nmarathon itself I was able to rely on\nMan Tai Tseung (Rag Chairman\n86-87) to provide me with helpers\nwho would make numerous cups of\ncoffee and go round collecting\nsponsorships from people in the JCR.\nThe morning hours weren't too bad;\npeople were always popping in\n(Drink-a Pub-Dry survivors were still\ncrawling back to IC at 3am!) including a delegation from QT Soc!\nI finished on time at 10pm just as\nMartin Taylor's Hypnosis lecture was\nending.\nCollecting the money was not so\neasy this time. I had 500 names from\nevery department on the forms and\nthere was no way I could go and see\nall of them. I tried sending notes to\nall concerned but the response rate\nwas abysmal. In the end I raised\n\u00a3805.37 out of the \u00a31,700 on the\nforms. The fact that I was working\nin the Centre Tor Biotechnology\nduring last year didn't help!\nThird year blues\nI was in two minds as to whether\nto do this event this year. On one hand\nit seemed natural to continue and try\nto raise as much money for Rag as\npossible. On the other, this being my\nfinal year was not going to make\ncollecting easier than before.\nI decided that if I was going to\ncollect more money than in previous\nyears I would have to iron out all the\nproblems faced in past years. Lack of\npublicity was a major problem in the\npast, but this year the marathon was\nan official Rag Week event and as\nsuch appeared on all the posters. I also designed and photocopied my\nown posters.\nOn the sponsorship front I played\nat all the RCS and Guilds fresher's dinners and was able to collect money\nfrom people as they sponsored me;\nthis has meant that relatively fewer\npeople need to be chased up from\neach dinner as opposed to the amount\nof money which has been collected\nalready. In fact, I 've been to 25\nfresher's dinners since I came to ICbut bought a ticket for only one of\nthem (highly dubious, Chas!)\nAt the time of writing (1.06 am,\nTuesday l st December) the total\namount ple ged on the forms is\n\u00a32,300ish of which about \u00a31,200 has\nbeen collected already.\nCriticisms\nOn the face of it, it looks like a lot\nof money is going to be raised for\nRag. Nevertheless, my piano-marathon has come in for criticism\nfrom various people. I feel it is only\nfair that answer some of these\ncriticisms.\nFirst, several people have\ncomplained at the methods I use to get\npeople to sponsor me. Some have\nasked me whether I want to become\na Timeshare/double glazing salesman\n(no, I want to become a stock bro king yuppie!). I make no apologies\nwhatsoever for adopting a \"hard-sell\" approach. In many cases I had\nto \" cold call\"; i.e. approach total\nstrangers from scratch. I learned\nquickly that you do not raise\nthousands for Rag by taking no for\nan answer. Briefly, there are 3 sorts\nof people, (i) those who will readily\nsponsor me, sometimes without me\nhaving to ask them, (ii) those who will\nsponsor me but need to be \"sold on\nthe idea\" (by far the majority), and\n(iii) the mean b* st*rds who don't give\na sh*t about the good work done by\ncharities and the help given to them\n\u2022 by IC students. I won't name names\nbut these people know who they are\nand why I have little time for them.\nOthers have questioned my motives\nfor doing the marathon. The best\n\"excuse\" that I heard was that last\nyear I did the marathon to restore my\nUnion credibility after screwing up\nmy second year exams! I can only say\nthat in view of the time and effort\ninvolved in organising the marathon\nthis is pretty feeble. I certainly wasn't thinking of my \"credibility\" after\nbeing without proper sleep for a day\nand a half. I should point out that I actually lose money on this event\u2014I don't claim back any of my expenses\n(this year has cost me about \u00a325).\nFinally, some people have asked\nwhat happens if they don't pay. Last\nyear a Physics fresher asked me if I would be \"sending the boys round\"\nif she didn't pay up! (Yes I can still\nremember you asking!) I can do\nwithout such cynicism; I have no\nmeans of enforcing people to pay\nother than appealing to their\nconsciences.\nNext year\nL.I won't be here. I would be\ndisappointed if this event died because\nno-one could play the piano for 40\nhours (believe me it's not all that\ndifficult). Most of the time I churned\nout improvised 'elevator/rest aur ant/background music'; I don't mean\nto boast but it requires very little\neffort to produce this sort of music for\nhours on end! If there are any pianists\nout there would might be interested\nin doing this marathon next year I would be more than glad to give them\nthe benefit of 3 years experience.\nThis article would be incomplete\nwithout thanks to everyone who has\never helped me with the marathon in\nwhatever way.\nCharles Brereton\nFELIX Friday 4th December 1987 11\n\n"

Please\nmark what you think is most important before handing in articles.\nAERO Plane trivia\nWho was the first Arab in space?\nWhat is the national airline of\nMalawi? These and even more obtuse\nquestions were asked at the Royal\nAeronautical Society's Aero Challenge (a sort of aviation Trivial\nPursuit), held on November 27. Two\nteams from IC faced competition from\n18 other university and polytechnic\nteams. Both teams survived the initial\nround-robin, but unfortunately IC 2\nbowed out in the quarter-finals. After\nmuch nail-biting, IC 1, consisting of\nSteve McParlin (capt), Phil Chandy\nand Nick Lay ('The Muttley Crew'),\nmanaged to reach the final, where\nthey faced the defending champions,\nthe dreaded Glasgow Engineers. IC\nstarted shakily, but gradually drew\nahead to finish with a clear winning\nmargin of 185-95. The victors were\npresented with the Aero Challenge\nshield by the quiz master, Raymond\nBaxter, and were invited to the RAeS\nannual dinner to be re-awarded the\nshield by the president.\nMany thanks to Dave JohnsonNewell for turning up in response to\na panic request for team members and\nstaying to score (mug!).\nWEIGHTS Total\nbeginners\nThe Weights Club has, up until now,\nbeen unsuitable for total beginners.\nHowever next term instruction will be\nprovided for anybody who is\ninterested in weight-training. The\ninitial training will give participants\na general introduction, upon which\nmore specialised training, for\nwhatever goal, may be built.\nAnybody at any level, who is\ninterested in weight training for\nwhatever reason, is welcome. This is\njust a notification of plans for next\nterm. Details will be given in the next\nissue of FELIX and at the beginning\nof next term, though training sessions\nwill be at lunchtimes next term.\nMOTOR Race circuit\nMembers of Guilds Motor (and\nsporting motorcycle) Club hired the\nGoodwood race circuit last Saturday\nfor a day of general testing. Each\ndriver had three twenty-minute\nsessions of track time with\nexperienced instructors for\nnewcomers.\nAs always, safety was of utmost\nimportance with a full complement of\nflag marshals, fire extinguishers and\nan ambulance.\nSNOOKER Handicapped\nThirty-two people entered this year's open competition which was held in\nthe Snooker Club during last week.\nWith over 200 club members, this\nwas a pretty disappointing\ntournament.\nPlay proceeded on Monday evening\nand by semi-final stage there were,\nrather predictably, only committee\nmembers left, although Chairman\nRichard Wiles had a close scrape in\nthe quarter finals against Graham\nGreenaway of Civ Eng. Graham was\nrobbed of a20 lead by a desperately\nunlucky foul in the second frame. It\nproved to be the turning point of the\nmatch and he eventually lost 3-1.\nThe final stages were a gruelling\ntest since much pride was at stake.\nThe final result was as follows: Open\nChampion 1987: Martin Hall, Runner\nup Richard Wiles, third place Andy\nPoon and fourth was Clive Roberts.\nThe highest break was 31, scored by\nWiles.\nLooking ahead, Snooker Club\nhopes to run a handicap competition\nbefore Easter, but what handicap do\nwe give? We presently have a big\nbreak chart and soon we are starting\na ladder. These are two very\nimportant ways of assessing a player's ability. By giving players a handicap\neverybody has an equal chance of\nwinning\u2014or so the theory goes. So\nmy advice to all members is to join\nthe ladder! It's worth it because the\nEaster handicap is the tournament of\nthe year.\nDIGGERS\nPub gold\nThis Tuesday (December 8) Diggers\nClub is organising a sponsored charity\npub crawl run along the lines of a game of golf. Teams of four are\nrequired to take, on average, four\n'shots' per 'hole' on an eighteen hole\ncourse. Points are acquired per shot\ntaken with sponsorship being paid on\na per point basis. Money raised will\ngo to IC Rag (50%) and Imperial\nCancer Research.\nA shot is taken by drinking one half\nof beer/lager, a short or a pint of soft\ndrink. Bunkers and differently parred\nholes are included on the course. The\ncourse itself consists of a number of\nholes around College.\nAs golf is a civilised game played\nby civilised people, anyone behaving\nin an ungentlemanly or\nunsportsmanlike manner, for example\nthrowing up, will be considered to\nhave lost his/her ball, their team will\nconsequently be fined one or more\nshots at the marshals' discretion.\nPrizes will be awarded to the team\nscoring the most points and the team\nraising the most money. These will\nbe engraved tankards kept behind the\nUnion Bar for use by team members\nuntil the following year's tournament.\nIf there are any more interested\npeople could you contact the\nfollowing asap:\nNigel Baker (Chem Eng 4),\nMike Oxley ( MRE2), Greg Wright (Physics 3).\n\u00a32 per team green fees is payable, all\nof which will go to charity.\nSRI LANKA Cup of tea\nThe Sri Lankan Society's 'drink a cup\nof tea for Rag' proved to be a success.\nThe stall held in the first half of Rag\nWeek may well have broken new\nground by the involvement of an\nOverseas Students Committee society\nin Rag.\nOnly the best, pure Sri Lankan tea,\nconsidered by connoisseurs to be the\nbest in the world, was served. The tea\nwas supplied free by the Ceylon Tea\nCentre.\nTea and Rag Mags were sold\ngenerating a total of \u00a3124. My thanks\nto everyone who helped. I was\npleasantly surprised at the number of\npeople who helped despite being non-members, simply because it was for\nRag.\nPHOTO Dark hole\nPhotosoc has suffered the past few\nyears by having a membership solely\nof shadows who disappear at\nunearthly hours down a hole in Beit\nQuad. After weeks of scratching and\nscraping at the old paintwork, the\nsame dark hole has now been\nredecorated and a new high-profile\nclub is emerging.\nPhotosoc offers everything you\nwould want to develop and print black\nand white or colour films and Club\nmembers can get cheap films, paper\nand chemicals through bulk purchases\nwith the Club. If you don't know an\nf stop from a bus stop you will be\ngiven your first black and white film\nand even shown how to develop it and\nprint up the results\u2014so don't be afraid\nto show your ignorance. There will\nbe a special meeting for new members\nin the upper part of Southside near the\nside entrance on Tuesday at 5.30pm where you can lounge around and ask\nany questions. If you're already keen\nto join then bring the usual passport\nsized photo along so that you can be\nissued with a glossy membership\ncard.\nFor regular members, or if\nTuesdays aren't your scene the Club\nmeets Thursdays at 5.30pm in the\nBrown Committee Room at the top of\nthe Union Building near STOIC.\nIf any previous members of\nPhotosoc have anything stored in the\ndarkrooms contact Sophie Jackson\n(int 4541), Phil Turner (int 7488) or\ncome along on Tuesdays 5.30pm, Southside.\n24 Friday 4th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "ure s THE FIFTH COLUMN\nAesthetic Design\nDesign is more\nthan the creation of\na functional device;\nit is as equally\nconcerned with the\naesthetic appeal of\nthe final product.\nThis is the belief of\nMr Paul Ewing,\ncoordinator of the\nIndustrial Design\nEngineering course\nrun jointly by the\nMechanical\nEngineering\nDepartment at\nImperial College\nand the Department\nof Industrial Design\nat the Royal\nCollege of Art. The\ntwo-year course\n(for engineering\ngraduates) was set\nup in 1980, with\nthe aim of\n'combining the\nfunction and logic\nof engineering with\nthe imagination and\nbeauty of design'.\n\u2014Looking good?\nMuch of the original funding was\nprovided by the Royal Commission\nfor the 1851 Exhibition, and most of\nthe students are themselves supported\nby the Science and Engineering\nResearch Council.\nIn their first year, the students are\nencouraged to develop their\nappreciation of such things as colour,\nform and texture and also their ability\nto communicate through sketches and\nmodels. After the cultural desert of\ntraditional engineering course, as Mr Ewing put it, 'It brings out the\ncreativity that was there from primary\nschool\u2014like taking the lid off the\nbox'. But everything is kept in\nperspective with courses on\nproduction, materials and business\nstudies.\nThe second year is spent on a major\ndesign project, the results of last\nyear's work being exhibited recently\nin the Mechanical Engineering Foyer.\nEach student chooses his own project,\nthe emphasis being on a balance of\nengineering and industrial design.\nThe student is then responsible for the\nwhole spectrum of design from\noriginal concept, to testing and\nthrough to manufacture.\nProjects on display included:\n\u2022Stairlift for disabled people\u2014with\nfold down arms for easy access.\n\u2022 Saucemaker\u2014with ' innovative\nvibrator y mixing system'.\n\u2022 Enclosed motor c yle \u2014perhaps a little noisy for the rider.\n\u2022 Portable wind energy\nconverter\u2014at 23kg and a fold-down\nsize of 1.5m,a little cumbersome.\nBut to find fault with those projects\nis to miss the point, Mr Ewing\nbelieves, as even one of the more\nsuccessful designs; the folding bicycle\nby Mark Sanders (an IC graduate),\ntook two years of further development\nand funding before reaching\nproduction.\nJudging the success of the course\nis not easy. Past projects have gone\non to win national and international\ndesign awards, such as the coveted\nBraun Design Prize for a sewing\nmachine in 1983. Past students have\ngone on equally to design\nconsultancies and industry, with firms\nsuch as Jaguar and GEC actually\nsponsoring students on the course.\nNotably, one graduate is currently\ndesign manager at Lewmar Marine,\na company whose wares grace both\nthe Americas Cup and Howard's Way!\nInterest in the course is steadily\ngrowing; this year there were 65\napplications for the 15 or so places\nand next year Mr Ewing expects\naround 100. But, while companies\nlike the concept, they are less\nforthcoming with actual participation.\nIn the future Mr Ewing would like\nto see aspects of the course integrated\ninto the standard engineering degree.\nBut whether or not this will actually\nhappen remains to be seen.\nLetter\nfrom\nSt. Mary'sI suppose this piece is written for all\nthose people who toil ceaselessly\nbehind the scenes to ensure the\nsuccess of any large theatrical or\nmusical event. This weekend I have\nbeen the object of irritation for 60\n'artistes'. I know that people who\nwork behind the scenes have on many\noccasions suffered the same, perhaps\nworse fate.\nHere at St Mary's we are in the\nproduction week of the musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way\nto the Forum. Since the run is for a full five days, finishing tonight, the\nsmall amount of equipment hired for\nthe week arrived that Friday and had\nto be fully functional for the dress\nrehearsal at 9.30am on Saturday.\nAfter arguing with the assembled\ncast for one and a half hours last\nFriday to vacate the small area so the\nlighting people could gain access to\npoint and focus the lights, we worked\nuntil 5.30am on Saturday morning.\nUp again at 8.30am, we ran into\nproblems delaying the final run-through. After being pushed around\nfor the past two weeks because 'the\ncast needed to rehearse on stage' one\nexpected a little tolerance as the fault\nwas not ours, but a piece of desk\ncontrol cable multicore was found to\nbe wired incorrectly when returned to\nthe company.\nThe impression I received last\nweekend was that the stage and\nlighting were evil messages in the way\nof true artistic development, and that\nwhatever one strives to perform,\nmiracles are not quite attainable. So\nfor all those people who toil all hours\nthat God sends and who barely, if\never, gain the true rewards they\ndeserve, these are the people that\nmake it all possible and without them\nthere would be no performance.\nNext week at our Recreation Centre\nfollowing the musical, from Monday\nto Wednesday DramSoc perform\nStags & Hens (???) by Willy Russell\n(which I recommend after seeing\nrehearsals). Performances start at\n7.30pm and tickets are \u00a32. The\naddress for those interested is 38 to\n36 Sussex Gardens (Paddington tube\nfor Edgware Road). All are welcome\nso come and see how medical students\nreally behave\u2014nothing like the\nrumours, but much worse.\nFELIX Friday 4th December 1987 9\n\n"

    "content": "Ignorance and\nUnconsciousness\nUNDER BH THE MICROSCOPE\nSPECIAL\nBefore the\ndiscovery of\nanaesthetics in 1846\nsurgical operations\nwere very\ndangerous, very\npainful and very\nmuch a last resort.\nDeaths on the\noperating table\nwere frighten ly common. Lucky\npatients could\nexpect to be\nknocked out by a blow to the head or\nwith large doses of\nhashish or alcohol.\nThe more\nunfortunate were\nsimply held down\nwhile the surgeon\nwent about his\nbloody business.\nMedical science has come a long way\nsince the nineteenth century; in this\ncountry alone more than three million\noperations a year are performed with\nrelative comfort to the patient.\nHowever this impressive fact tends to\nobscure the reality of anaesthesia\nresearch; nobody knows how\nanaesthetics work.\nThat is not to say that many people\nhave not tried to elucidate how\nanaesthetics induce unconsciousness\nbut leave respiration and blood\ncirculation relatively unimpaired. The\nheart of the mystery is that, as a class\nof drugs, anaesthetics are completely\nbizarre; xenon gas is an anaesthetic;\nso is alfa x alone, a steroid compound;\nso is de canol,a long chain alcohol.\nWhat is it about these diverse\nchemicals that makes them\nanaesthetics? Do they all act at the\nsame site in the brain or at a number\nof different sites?\nMany drugs one\naction\nOne unifying feature is that\nanaesthetics are all relatively inert and\na polar( or hydrophobic). This latter\nfact was demonstrated at the turn of\nthe century by Hans Meyer and E Overton in 1900. They found that the\npotency of an anaesthetic correlated\nclosely with its solubility in olive oil!\nNow olive oil is simply a mixture of\nlipid molecules (these are just long\nchains of water-hating hydrocarbons\nwith a water-liking group on the end)\nand since the membrane (or skin)\ncovering nerve cells in the brain is\nalso partially composed of lipids it\nseemed an obvious target site. Many\npeople suggested that anaesthetics\nexerted their effect by dissolving in\nthe lipid portion of the membrane and\nsomehow shutting off the cell.\nIt was a very attractive hypothesis.\nNerve membranes are responsible for\nboth the transmission of electrical\nsignals along nerve fibres (which are\nsimply extensions from the cell body)\nand for the communication of these\nsignals between two cells. To be\nprecise these functions are performed\nby a variety of protein molecules\nwhich 'float' in the lipid bilayer of the\nmembrane (see Fig 1). Proteins are\nelegant molecular machines and it was\nwidely assumed that by dissolving in\nthe lipid portion of the membrane,\nanaesthetics disrupted the lipid\nenvironment of these proteins causing\nthem to malfunction.\nThe Meyer-Overton correlation\nseemed to provide the answer to the\nbasic riddle of anaesthetic action.\nLipid bilayer s in nerve membranes\nexist in age ll or jelly-like state; as\nsuch they provide just the sort of\nhydrophobic and flexible site which\ncould accommodate the different\nshapes and sizes of anaesthetic\nmolecules.\nHowever further support for the\nlipid theory was hard to come by. It\nwas variously proposed that\nanaesthetic expanded the membrane,\n'fluid is ed' it or reduced its gel to\nliquid-crystalline transition\ntemperature. These were attempts to\nexplain how anaesthetics in the\nmembrane might ultimately inhibit the\nprotein activity essential to the cell's proper functioning. In the 1960s, when artificial membranes were\nstudied extensively, all these effects\nwere indeed found. But at\nconcentrations of anaesthetic which\ninduced unconsciousness they were\ntiny, if not ne glib le. Putting the lights\nout\nThis was a big problem. Nevertheless\nthe persuasive power of the MeyerOverton correlation was sufficient to\nmaintain interest in lipid theories of\nanaesthetic action\u2014particularly in the\nabsence of a plausible alternative. In\nOUTSIDE CELL FLUID HYDROCARBON REGION LIPID BILAYER INSIDE CELL Figure 1\nLipid molecules form symmetric, double layer in membranes called the\nbilayer. Protein molecules in this jelly-like bilayer are free to float\nsideways.\n6 Friday 4th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

Luckily for us they didn't mention Rag.\nWhat they did mention was that, among other things, IC\nstudents stripped the walls of signs, let off a fire\nextinguisher and were found urinating in corridors.\nAccording to TLS, IC caused over \u00a31000 worth of\ndamage.\nOf course, their report was exaggerated, but even so,\nwhat good does this do IC? When I enquired as to why\nthe UL U Bar was chosen for this event I was informed\nthat it was because ' UL U are a bunch of com mie lefties\nand we hate them'. I was also told that Tan wanted us\nto trash UL U', although I find this hard to believe.\nI admit that when UL U was first chosen I put up no\nfight. But when another pub offered Rag 50% of their\nprofits if we chose to drink them dry and UL U was still\ninsisted upon I began to wonder about the point of having\nsuch an event for Rag. The argument is that any pub that\nknew we were coming would 'stock up' and we wouldn't have a chance of drinking it dry. But how much chance\ndid we have of draining Mergers?\nIt's not just the fact that Rag gave up the chance of\nraising a considerable amount of money, nor the fact that\nImperial students are once again condemned as 'louts' that\nreally saddens and depresses me, but the fact that no one\nseems to care about IC's reputation.\nPerhaps it is something to be proud of that more and\nmore colleges want to ban us. Perhaps we should go on\nuntil we are totally isolated\u2014that would really show them\nwouldn't it? Then we could all have a jolly good laugh\nwhen no one wants to apply here anymore and Mines\ncloses due to lack of students. Perhaps we could celebrate\nby going to Mergers.\nYours sincerely,\nEmma Barrett, Rag Secretary (April\u2014December 1987).\nSerious and sorry\nDear Judith\nAt last\u2014a serious letter from me (how boring!).\nFirstly, I am not pleased with whoever pulls down my\nposters. If you are heterosexual then it should not effect\nyou. Don't flatter yourself that a homosexual is likely to\n'make a pass at you'\u2014I for sure do not fancy anyone just\nbecause they are male, any more than you fancy anyone\nwho is female\u2014well except maybe in C&G, where there\nare only four or five females so you can't be choosy (I should know\u2014I'm in Mech Eng!). If you are bisexual/gay,\nthen I feel sorry for you if you are so insecure and scared\nto be yourself that you feel the need to destroy anything\nthat reminds you of your own sexuality.\nSecondly, WOW!!! Some people have actually contacted me and I have met\nthem and talked to them. They said they were gay, but\nwere terrified that their friends would find out. To me\nthat says something about their friends. Do you realise\ntna i your bad attitude may be making one of your friends\nvery, very unhappy?\nPS. Sorry if this letter is directed mainly at men\u2014there\nare more of th pm amd they are generally more intolerant\nthan women. Please write and tell me if you disagree/agree\nwith what I have written.\nJames Papa (Mech Eng 2),\nLesbian & Gay Welfare Officer\nNUS radicals\nDear Judith,\nI am writing this letter with a view to public ising the\nrebirth of IC's more radical societies. Pro-NUS. I have\nno wish to provoke major debate at this stage as plans\nto relaunch the society are still in a state of flux, but I would ask any undergraduates or postgraduates who have\nany interest in this area, regardless of political persuasion,\nto contact me via the Physics pigeonholes in the Blackett\nBuilding. Views from people who may have had held\nprevious NUS positions prior to coming to IC would be\nespecially welcome.\nYours sincerely,\nPhilip Gribbon, Physics 1.\nSpace trap\nDear Madam,\nThanks for a great SciTech column on 20.11.87 but\nSteve seems to have fallen into the same trap that has been\ncarefully, I must say, prepared for our so-called liberal\npress, by the Military Industrial Complex (MIC) of the\nUSA. The MIC are pleased with attacks on SDI as being\ndangerous and unrealistic; at least they give the programme\nspace and legitimacy that it certainly does not deserve.\nThe main issue is simply whether the largest debt-ridden\nnation in the world today, can afford such a massive\nmismanagement of resources in the face of its present\nfinancial un healthiness. Yours sincerely,\nDC Azubike, PG3.\nHard times\nDear Judith,\nTimes must be hard in the Physics Department when\none of its students considers himself unusual in having\nspoken to members of the opposite sex (Steve Mercer,\nFELIX785). Maybe Mr Mercer should consider joining\nPATA. However, he was not asked to explain why he is\nuniquely qualified to talk about abortion. What he was\nasked to explain is why 'a woman can choose to end the\nlife of her child simply because it is still in the womb'\n(Hugh McKenzie, FELIX784). He tried to do this on the\ngrounds of the 'unwanted complications' caused by the\nunborn. He didn't seem to notice that the born can bring\nabout 'unwanted complications' too. Does he support\ninfanticide as well? Bu: for some theory about 'hypnotic\nregression' he says lit Je else.\nSurely he has a better argument than this.\nYours faithfully,\nMatthew Soane (Maths 2), PATA Chairman.\nFELIX Friday 4th December 1987 27\n\n"

'I demand to be taken back to Cheapskate immediately. The\ncitizens can't manage without me.'\n'Silence!', thundered six huge Sorryland rug ger buggers in unison. 'You're not\ngoing anywhere until Cheapskate has paid the ransom.'\nWhygate was in a bit of a fix. At the weekend he had been captured by a mob\nof citizens from nearby Sorryland. All the Sorryland citizens were still very cross\nthat the rug ger buggers from Cheapskate had caused so much damage in their\ncitizens' bar, and so had decided to exact revenge on Cheapskate. They had\ncrept up on Whygate, thrown a blanket over his head, and bundled him into their\ngetaway van.\nWhygate had had a very rough journey to Sorryland. By the time he was let\nout of the van he was in a very bad mood indeed. The head citizen of Sorryland\nhad greeted him in a very slimy manner.\n'Mr Whygate, I presume', said the Sorryland head citizen.\n'The scum of the earth, I presume', said Whygate, not wanting to be drawn\ninto small talk with his captors.\n'I see', said the Sorryland head citizen. 'Take him away and throw him into\nthe deepest dungeon in the Sorryland castle', he commanded his rug ger buggers.\nWhygate had been confident that all the Cheapskate citizens would be arriving\nsoon in large numbers to rescue him. Unfortunately, nobody had noticed that\nhe had diss appeared. In fact, it was not until the following day, when the\nSorryland head citizen sent his ransom demand to the Cheapskate citizens' office,\nthat the rest of the Cheapskate citizens realised he had gone. When the head\ncitizen of Sorryland telephoned Cheapskate it was Chas Takeiteasy who answered\nthe call, so it took quite some time for the message to get across.\n'Hello, citizen of Cheapskate', said the Sorryland citizen. 'I am calling to let\nyou know that we have Whygate'.\n'I'm sorry, he's not in at the moment', said Takeiteasy. As usual he had only\njust got out of bed, and so was not quite with it.\n'No, he's here', broke in the Sorryland citizen. 'And you're not getting him\nback until you give us one hundred pounds for our Rug collection'.\n'Perhaps you could phone back after lunch', said Takeiteasy. 'I'm sure he'll\nbe back then'.\nTakeiteasy put the phone down, confident that he had dealt with another\npersistent caller in an effective manner. He was just about to crawl back under\nhis pile of insurance claim forms when the phone rang again. It was the head\ncitizen of Sorryland once more, and this time he sounded very cross.\n'Now listen, meat head', said the Sorryland citizen. 'Either you get collecting\nor he stays in our dungeon. What are you going to do about it?'\nTakeiteasy was still not quite sure what the caller was getting so upset about,\nbut he was certain that he had heard the word 'meat head' so decided the call\nmust be for Ego, the deputy head citizen.\n'I think this is for you, Ego' called Takeiteasy. With that, he went back to his\nnest of papers and went to sleep.\n'Hello, Alan Ego speaking, can I help you?' said Ego, picking up the phone.\n'For the last time', shouted the Sorryland citizen, audibly foaming at the mouth,\n'We've got Whygate here in Sorryland and you're not getting him back until we\nget one hundred pounds for our Rug collection'.\n'You're just saying that to please me', chuckled Ego, always ready to play\nalong with a practical joke.\n'You don't believe me?', screamed the Sorryland citizen. 'Okay, have it your\nway. We'll send you some proof within the hour'.\nEgo was still not too concerned. In fact he thought it was quite pleasant not\nto have to put up with Whygate's usual frenzied antics. Only an hour later,\nhowever, Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks got the fright of her life when she discover da ransom note wrapped around half of Whygate's moustache in an envelope\nfrom Sorryland.\n'It's disgusting', she shuddered.\n'Yes, but at least he'll have to shave the whole thing off now', quipped Ego.\n'But how are we going to raise the money. I don't think the citizens will give\na hundred pounds just to have Wygate back.'\n'I know', said Mrs Jolly Hockey Sticks. 'Tell everyone that they'll keep him\nif we raise the money. That's bound to work....\nWill anyone see Whygate again?\nWhat does he look like with only half a moustache?\nWhich bit of him will be sent back next?\nFind out in the next episode of 'The Baron of Cheapskate'.\nFriday 4th December 1987\n\n"

Be\nthere!\njs iii if i ill Jit*\nAdmission\nDear Judith,\nI was interested to read Nigel Whitfield's views on my\nopinion article Is FELIX Biased?, and particularly his\ncomments on the news story Irresponsible Ian. lam forced\nto concede that on this occasion I did not have time to\nlisten to the tapes personally, mainly because printing\nproblems in FELLX demanded the completion of two fairly\nhefty features by Wednesday. However in this case the\nfacts were confirmed by two separate sources, one of\nwhom is a prominent member of IC Radio. I regard their\naccount as totally reliable and I have no reason to believe\nthat the two sources had collaborated in some way to tell\nme a porky pie.\nI do not think that Mr Whitfield actually disagrees with\nmy interpretation of the interview, but the issue can easily\nbe resolved if Mr Whitfield feels strongly about it. All Mr Whitfield has to do is rebroadcast the interview on\nIC Radio, or to print an accurate transcript in FELIX. I acknowledge, however, that in an ideal world I should\nhave listened to the tapes myself, and in fact I had made\narrangements with Mr Whitfield to do so. Having worked\nin FELIX himself, Mr Whitfield must realise that when\nthings go wrong one has to do the best one can in the time\navailable. Nevertheless I would not have included the\nsection in question had I not been entirely convinced of\nits authenticity.\nI do not think that any of Mr Whitfield's comments are\nrelevant to the point of the article, namely that there is\na lack of communication between FELIX and Ian\nHowgate, that this is a bad thing, and that it is in\neveryone's interest to see the situation resolved.\nYours,\nBill Goodwin.\nIt seems that poor old Bill is still under the\nmisapprehension that we don't communicate. We try\nto communicate but communication is a two-way thing\ndear!\nDreadful\nDear Judith,\nRegarding your letter (issue no ?) from Bryan Adams,\nthe dreadful Canadian folk singer, I'd like to mention that\nwhile I was sitting in the Holland Club recently, someone\ncame up to me and asked if I was Roger Serpell. Roger\nSerpell is, of course, the well-known chairman of the\nHolland Club, and also possibly better known as a great\nadmirer of 'Stagefright', the greatest band in the whole\nhistory of the whole world, the only band capable of\nmaking their audience chant in unison: 'Don't Bogart the\nsick bag my friend, pass it over to me'. I suggest you start\na competition for your readers to see if anyone can point\nto someone in the College bar and catering world whom\nI do actually resemble.

This is the\n'tongue-in-cheek view of student life'\nbut, the trouble is, it's reached that\nstage in the term when there's f**k all happening, so I 've got so little to\ntalk about. Either way there is\nsomething happening which I don't know, stuff it in the Maths\npigeonhole. By the way my tongue is\nin my cheek and not between anybody\nelse s, so don't go thinking I 'll be\ninoffensive.\nFirsdy, I just tried a new Norman's omelette, now I admire the cooking\nand diversification this place is\nundergoing, but, gentle readers,\nunless you've got twenty-five minutes\nspare don't bother with the wait, my\nadvice to you if you want a quick one\nis to invest in a pack of Norman's condoms instead.\nNow I have just started noticing\nhow halls are developing aC CUo udo ok on life. They have developed\nchants ranging from the boring\n'everywhere we go...' from Linstead\nto the esoteric 'Bugabahstud,\nBugabahstud, wh angle' from\nHolbein. The spirit and rationality of\nmascot ry has been captured in\nstealing one another's fridges. All the\nhouses need to do now is develop the\nvaguely useful bits of C CU life.\nI hear that at Tuesday'sU GMa motion almost made it that each of the\nCC Us should adopt one of George,\nZippy and Bungle from Rainbow as\na mascot and Ian Howgate should\ninvite Geoffrey over to give a talk.\nPersonally I'm in favour of this\nbecause it will give added character\nto the CC Us for instance I'd like\nGeorge for RCS because I like pink,\nZippy (the py jama case) and the RS M have a lot in common (they're all\nstuffed with materials). This leaves\nBungle for C&G... Rag Week is over, but who won the\nKiller game? It was real fun adding\nparanoia to College life, squirting the\nCollege security when they break into\nyour house. Still the halls were\nannoyed. One house has even charged\nan \u00a38 fine to one player for 'wilful\ndamage to property'. The College\nauthorities were so worried about\ndamp in the Hamlet Gardens.\nThat's all I gotta say for now\nTT FN. PS.

A letter\nfrom Surrey University Union to the\nU GM described their terms: \u00a3100 to\ncut Ian's hair; \u00a3200 to shave his legs\nand arms; \u00a3300 to shave the rest of\nhis head; and \u00a3500 to remove all the\nh? ir from his body. The first \u00a3100\nwas guaranteed by ICU and any\nPresident Alan Rose and Honorary\nSecretary Chas Jackson drove down\nto Surrey to investigate the position.\nThey discovered that Ian had been\ncontinuing his Presidential work using\nSurrey Union's telephones. They\nreported that he seemed quite happy,\nhaving been plied with drink and 'kept\nin a luxurious manner to which he\nwas totally unaccustomed'.\nWhilst in the area, the two\nsabbaticals decided to kidnap Surrey\nVice President Dave Watson. The\nreasons for this action are, however,\nunclear. Alan Rose first said that they\ndid it to secure Ian's release and then\nhe said it was to make sure that they\nkept him.\nAt 3 o 'clock on Wednesday Mr Howgate was taken to a student\nhouse, tied to a chair and given a severe haircut by a photographer from\ntheir Union newspaper Bare Facts,\nwho described Mr Howgate's appearance as 'rather remarkable'.\nHe was later swapped for Dave\nWatson at the Three Kings pub in\nWest Kensington but will return to\nSurrey if enough money is raised to\ngive him a further haircut.\nIan told FELIX that Surrey was 'a really nice place' and that nobody had\ntortured him. A representative from\nSurrey said that they had captured Ian\nbecause 'it seemed like a good idea\nat the time'. Chas Jackson said later\n.that the whole point of the stunt was\nto improve relations between Surrey\nand IC after members of several IC\nsports clubs behaved badly in the\nSurrey Union Bar. He felt that the\nstent had been incredibly successful.\nDonations to the Ian Howgate fund\nshould be made in the Union Office\nbefore Sunday.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

    "content": "Gentleman\nGeoff\nGeoff Parsons is\nmaking quite an\nimpact as President\nof RSMU. Dave\nBurns reviews\nMines and talks to\nGeoff about the\nUnion.\nThe 'Time Out' Student Guide this\nyear gave special mention to the\nRoyal School of Mines in its write up\nof Imperial College. It put forward the\nfamous image of Hon Porn Night,\ndrunken mindlessness and all the\nother popular misrepresentations of\nburly, sexist, racist bigots working\ntheir way through university in an\nalcoholic haze.\nAnyone who cares to take a look\nat the Royal School of Mines in this\nnew year, would see that this view,\nwhich has been waning in recent\ntimes, is crumbling under the\nleadership of Geoff Parsons as the\nPresident of R SMU. The beginning of this term saw a revamped Mines union office and a new pride in the identity and image\nof Mines. The change has been a long\ntime in the offing. For much of the\nseventies mining students tended to be\nthe more mature students, who prided\nthemselves on a work hard, play hard,\ndrink hard life style. As the nature of\ncourses in Mines changed, and the\nage of entrant to the College dropped,\nless experienced students were trying\nto uphold a tradition which they did\nnot have the ability to carry off.\nThe Royal School of Mines Union\nhad always been fiercely independent,\na closed social group which could not\nbe swallowed up by the rest of\nCollege. The change in nature of\nMining students, meant that R SMU was slowly being overwhelmed. With\nless organisation and commit t ment among students the 'Mines' identity\nwas being lost.\nWhen Ian Howgate became\nGeology Department Representative,\nhe began to highlight the fact the\nMines image should be changing.\nWhile Ian moved on to ICU, Geoff\nParsons has exploded onto the scene\nin Mines and taken a completely new\napproach to the problem.\nUpon meeting Geoff Parsons you\nare immediately struck by his strong\ncharacter. He is calm, business like\nand very organised. You are greeted\nwith courtesy, invited to chat with\nhim in the office and politely helped\nwith any questions. In short Geoff is\na real gentleman. I caught up with him\nafter a Mines U GM and talked about\nthe new direction R SMU is taking.\nGeoff stands out from the crowd..\nThe majority of the credit for the\ncomplete renewal of the Mines Office\ngoes to Geoff. His years on the\nathletics circuit\u2014he is the British high\njump record holder\u2014have given him\nmany contacts within business, and\nthe confidence to deal with them.\nHe's reluctant to discuss precisely\nwhere all the finance for the office\ncomes from. It is likely that the\ncompanies concerned were loathe to\nreveal their involvement to\ncompetitors,' or, it has been\nspeculated, they may have\ninvolvement in South Africa which\nthe Union could find embarrassing.\nGeoff is rig hd y proud of the office.\nT like to think I could bring the\nChairman of ICI in here without\nworrying he is coming into a beer-drenched hole which smells of puke.'\nThe office itself could easily be any\nexecutive office, plush carpeted, large\nchairs, and all the paraphernalia of\nwealth. It is immaculately clean and\nwell organised. Much of the\npaperwork from years past has been\nthrown out, and only relevant material\nremains. As we sat and chatted, the\nplace was busy with Union activity.\nIt is firmly established as a place\nwhere the business of R SMU goes on.\nSocialising is left to the bar and the\ncoffee room. Geoff feels the office has\npromoted 'self-pride in Mines' and in\ntime the students will reap the full\nbenefits. While jobs in the mining\nindustry in this country become\nincreasingly hard to come by,\ncontacts with industry can only help\nin the long term.\nThe Mines UG MI attended was the\nbest behaved and organised C CU meeting I have seen. Geoff seems to\ncommand attention and respect from\nwithin the Union, as do all the\nexecutive . The Union structure has\nbeen reinforced and appa rend y all the\nreps who are supposed to attend do\nso. Events are well publicised and\nattended.\nGeoff is clearly not accomplishing\neverything himself, but he is\ndemonstrating the sort of leadership\nand guiding influence which the other\nCC Us could do with.\nThe new image of the Union has\nalso promoted a good staff-student\nrelationship. The Dean and Heads of\nDepartments were all present at an\nevening to open the new office, and\nstaff members were much in evidence\nat the fresher s' dinner.\nR SMU may still be the smallest\nC CU in the College, but right now it\nis presenting the best face of any, and\nits President is head and shoulders\nabove the rest. The new approach\nwithin Mines is one which Geoff\nthinks ICU could well do with. It\ncertainly appears to be doing wonders\nfor R SMU. FELIX Friday 4th December 1987 13\n\n"

He has\nbecome depressed\nat the thought of\nhaving to deliver\nbillions of presents\nin just 24 hours.\nHe is getting old\nand feels the cold\nmore nowadays.\nThat is why he has\ndecided to go\nAWOL-but for a good cause. He has\njoined forces with\nthe Elimination of\nLeukaemia Fund\n(ELF) in order to\nraise money to fund\nnursing staff and\nequipment at Kings\nCollege Hospital.\nFour Londoners are diagnosed with\nLeukaemia or a related cancer every\nday. If they are lucky they face\ninjections, medication and blood\ntransfusions while doctors work to kill\noff the cancerous cells in their body.\nBut there is a real shortage of beds,\nnurses and equipment to treat\nLeukaemia. ELF aims to build a new\ntreatment unit at Kings College\nHospital. Santa and ELF are raising\nthis money by holding a giant Santa\nHunt around London on Sunday 13th December. All IC students can join\nin the hunt, starting from the Time\nOut offices in Southampton Street at\n4pm. It is a ten-point trail to Santa and\nshould take 1-2 hours. Once you've\nfound where he is, you can join the\nparty! Money is raised by sponsorship\nfor every checkpoint you successfully\ndiscover. There are some very good\nprizes as well. There will be a draw\nfrom everyone who finds Santa for a Wintersun week for two in Luxor,\nEgypt, and the best fundraiser wins\na \u00a3500 day at Way In at Harrods plus\na Psion Organiser II.\nA limited number of sponsorship\nforms are available from the FELIX Office.\nWhilst in Soho last Sunday, having\njust gorged myself on a selection of\ndelicious Chinese cakes and gallons\nof fresh tea from the Kowloon in\nGerrard Street and although feeling\na little worse for wear for eating too\nmuch, it struck me that I should try\nmy hand at a little Chinese cuisine.\nWith a budget of only a fiver I scrapped the idea of treating myself\nto a wok and seeing as it is necessary\nto be in a position of professional\nupward mobility to have such a utensil\nin one's kitchen I decided that I didn't exactly qualify and considered my\nposition, as typesetter operator for\nFELIX, as being, in contrast,\nabsolutely stationary.\nAnyway putting all these thoughts\nout of my head I set about gathering\ntogether the ingredients for 'Duck\nNoodle Soup'. The meat for this\nrecipe was bought in what I can only\ndescribe as a Chinese duck shop, also\nin Gerrard Street, where I managed\nto overcome a slight language\nproblem and ordered half a duck\nwhich was magnificently jointed by\na man with a big cleaver and very\nnimble fingers who doesn't drink at\nlunchtime if he's got any sense. After\npurchasing my duck (which comes\nready-cooked) I headed for the nearest\nsupermarket where I was confronted\nby lots of tea varieties, types of\nnoodles, and Chinese people all of\nwhich made life a little more difficult.\nBack in the sanctuary of my kitchen\nin Mitcham I set about preparing the\nsoup and the recipe is as follows:\nIngredients for 3 people:\nChicken stock\nVi a cooked duck\nVi lb dried noodles\nlA lb Chinese leaves (or similar\nvegetable)\nSalt and pepper to taste\nMethod:\nCook the noodles in a large pan of\nboiling water until they break apart\nand soften slightly, wash in cold water\nand drain for a minute or two, transfer\nthe noodles and the duck into the\nstock (which should be boiling as\nwell) cook all this for about five\nmi nites and at the very last point add\nthe Chinese leaves. This recipe is so\neasy and getting the ingredients can\nbe great fun\u2014so have a go!\nFELIX Friday 4th December 1987 17\n\n"

    "content": "BASKETBALL Flying low\nU AU First Round\nIC's basketball team found themselves\nwandering through low flying clouds\nin NW10 very early last Sunday\nmorning in search of the first rounds\nof the U AU. It proved to be an eventful day with\nthe team virtually running the whole\nshow, such is the poor level of\norganising by the U AU. Consequently it was after clearing the\ngym of the previous evening's effluent (it might be added, with no\nhelp from the arrogant Brunei\nUniversity squad) that play could\nactually commence.\nIC's first two games, against Brunei\nand LSE, were very tough but proved\nuseful training. The bench should be\ncongratulated for their sportsmanship\nfor giving L SEa standing ovation\nwhen they reached 100 points!\nThe final game against Kent was a real nail-biter, the score fluctuating\nup to plus or minus 10 points. At half\ntime the IC squad got fired up for a blistering second half. Steve Ancell\ncovered more court in ten minutes\nthan in the previous game and with\nsupport from Adam Galambos,\nSpencer Sherwin, Mark Ridgill,\nStuart Martin and the rest of the team,\nsuccessfully clawed back a9 point\ndeficit in the last minute of play. The\nIC substitutes, on the bench at that\ntime, were in full cry with lashing s of advice on how to bury Kent. The\nlast seconds saw the team go ahead\nby 2 points and successfully fend off\nKent's frenzied last stand.\nThe day ended with an excellent\ndisplay of control from LSE who\nslaughtered a, now less arrogant,\nBrunei. IC now has the prospect of\nthe second round to look forward to.\nRIFLE& PISTOL CLUB Friendly shooting\nOn Saturday November 21 IC Rifle\nand Pistol Club's pistol team went to\nCobham RPC to shoot in a friendly\nPolice Pistol, PP1, match.\nPP1 is a thirty round course of fire\nwhich is usually shot with a0.38\" calibre revolver. It consists of three\ntimed stages at distances of 25m,15m and 10m with the final stage being\ntwo shots in two seconds.\nThe match was shot outdoors in far\nfrom ideal conditions, which\nhandicapped the IC team because we\nare used to the comforts of indoor \\\nshooting.\nWe were totally outclassed by a far\nmore experienced club whose team\nincluded the current British champion\nof three years standing. Our best\nscore being 284 out of 300 compared\nto their 300 followed by two 297s. However, we are un deter ed by this\nexperience and have arranged a return\nmatch on St Valentine's Day (this\ntime we'll do the massacring!).\nWe are still open for membership.\nIf anyone is interested in joining then\nplease come and see us, on any\nweekday lunchtime, at the range in\nthe Sports Centre.\nRUGBY7 in a row\nIC l st XV30 Guys9 IC stretched their unbeaten run to\nseven games after a good\nperformance against Guys in the\nsecond round of the Gutteridge Cup\ndespite missing four regular first team\nplayers.\nFrom the start Guys came out\nstrongly winning a good ruc k and\nmaul ball and pinning IC in their own\n'22'. After absorbing the initial attack\nIC hit back with a double switch move\nleaving Jez Quirk only three players\nto beat and scoring under the posts.\nA few minutes later from a good\nru cke d ball A Watson fed T Paul who\nput Jez away for his second try. Guys\nhit back with a penalty to make the\nscore 10-3 and from the restart S Blamo coming into the line gave\nSimon Hall space on the left wing to\nrun in from four ty yards beating three\nmen on the way. IC stepped up the\npressure and with mint u es to go to\nhalf time A Watson ripped round the\nblindside to score the last try of the\nfirst half.\nIn the second half, Guys with the\nwind came back but good tackling by\nthe back row kept Guys out. Then\ncame the run of the match. Inside his\nown half Andy Watson broke blind\nfrom a maul, shrugged off the hooker,\ndum mie d the winger and fly half,\nside-stepped the centre, before\npassing to the hooker in the corner.\nFrom the resulting scrum M Tilbury\ndrove down the blindside for the first\nof his two debut ante tries. Guys then\nscored a consolation try before M Tilbury crossed again to make the\nfinal score 30-9.\nORIENTEERING Going schizophrenic\nLast Sunday, the Club attempted to\ngo schizophrenic and attend two\nevents in the same day, half the Club\ngoing to an event in Nottingham and\nhalf to Berkhamstead.\nThe area at Nottingham, in\nSherwood Forest, was flat and\nrun able and due to the icy conditions,\nsome oriente ers skated across part of\ntheir course.\nHowever, the group going to\nBerkhamstead failed to reach the\nevent and even failed to set off from\nCollege due to the fact that the\nminibus that had been booked had\nbeen given to another club, without\nprior notice.\nOne success of the weekend was\nTom Foster coming fifth in the British\nNight Championships on Saturday\nevening.\nThe results have now come through\nfrom the Karr im or Mountain\nMarathon held in late October.\nOrienteers Matthew Lynas and Dave\nClarke came 120th out of a field of\nover 300 on the score event, a very\ncreditable position for their first go.\nSAILING Amazing manoeuvres\nAfter a few delays, the team made an\nearly start for Bristol. It was another\ncold Saturday morning.\nOn arrival at the Chens Valley\nReservoir, the ice was removed from\nthe boats in preparation for the big\nrace. Despite favourable forecasts\nfrom the captain (Richard Jarman)\nthere was only a patchy light breeze,\nand it was still cold. Roll tacks were\nto be the order of the day, this made\nJenny Burton very nervous.\nApostolos Leouidhopoulos did not\ncapsize however, and went on to do\nsome amazing tactical manoeuvres,\nonly a few involved collisions.\nAlthough Bristol's second team put\nup a good fight the final score was\n4-1. Our infamous ladies' team\nfancied their chances but\nunfortunately time ran out. Luck was\non our side.\nMany thanks to Bristol, especially\nfor the overnight accommodation and\nspecial transport.\n22 Friday 4th December 1987 FELIX\n\n"

It's true. In one hour they devote maybe\nfive minutes to students outside of the\nlecture theatres and of those five about\nin an annual series of pop concerts\nleading to the Games set in Ibiza. The\nBBC, in their great wisdom, have\ndecided to screen highlights of this\nevent on Saturday (BBC2, 7.35pm) including Marillion and Freddie\nMercury with Montserrat Caballe. I just can't wait until 1992!\nIf you're kind of kinky, The Film\nClub (BBC2, Saturday, 10pm) is\nshowing two films about male\nobsession. One is French and sounds\nunmissable: 'two women exercise a form of sexual terrorism' on the\nhapless hero! The second is Man of\nRowers which is 'profoundly erotic'?\nMmm, sounds interesting.\nFor those of you following the\nhideous Dancing Days (Channel 4 ,\n11.30am, Saturday), it's just getting\nso exciting! Carlos has finally found\nout Julia's true identity and is still\nmadly in love with her! Watch\ntomorrow's episode to find out what\nwill happen next.\nThere are some really crass\nprogrammes on Saturday night. I really pity the masses who look\nforward to their TV dinner with Blind\nDate (ITV, 7.15pm) and Copy Cats\n(ITV, 6.45pm). Don't do it! There is\na programme you must watch on\nChannel 4 instead. At6.32 pm tomorrow they will be screening Not\nthree minutes are devoted to FELIX, an interview with last year's Editor\n;\nDavid Jones plus lots of shots of the\nFELIX mega stars. Talking of crass programmes\nthere's Laughs from the Palladium\n(LTV, Sunday, 7.15pm). Don't you\njust hate Jimmy Tarbuck? This\nprogramme is meant to be highlights\nof the comedy they've featured but I don't thing it's even worth turning on\nthe set.\nWhat is worth watching is the\nglorious Spitting Image ( ITV, Sunday, 10.05pm). This is the last in\nthe current series; shame! Worth ten\ntimes what Laughs from the\nPalladium is worth! Spitting Image is\nfollowed by a South Bank Show (TTV,\n10.35pm) devoted to Eric Clapton. It\ntraces his life from his childhood in\nSurrey, through to his success with\nthe sixties pop group the Yardbirds\nand supergroup Cream. It features his\nyears of drug and alcohol addition.\nTorrid tales!\nNight Network features Jethro Tull\n(ITV, Monday, lam) and if you can\nbear to stay up all night there's TV\nCensored Bloopers (ITV, Monday,\n4am) which claims to be hilarious outtakes from American TV based on\nIt'll Be Alright on the Night.\nFELIX Friday 4th December 1987 19\n\n"

On this occasion he was\ndriving a Fiat Uno.\nA large audience witnessed possibly\nthe most exciting U GM of this week\non Tuesday in the J CR with lively\ndebate on several issues by Chairman\nAlastair Seymour. The meeting was\nopened with the reading of a letter\nfrom Surrey University Students'\nUnion about the kidnapping of Ian\nHowgate (see front page). The papers\nstill not having arrived the meeting\nmoved onto an emergency motion on\nsmoking in the Union Snack Bar\nwhich was passed with an amendment\nto allow smoking to continue at the\nLounge Bar.

This was\npassed and quorum was successfully\nchallenged.\nOpen day\nThe Royal School of Mines held its\nopen day on Thursday. Between 200\nand 250 people took advantage of this\nchance of seeing around the\ndepartments of Geology, Materials\nand Mineral Resources Engineering,\nand several companies put up displays\nshowing the sorts of jobs graduates\nin these fields might expect.\nDr Flower from the Department of\nMaterials, one of the organisers, said\nthat although the number of people\nattending was lower than expected, he\nconsidered the event a success in\nterms of the interest shown. He was\nalso pleased with the number of firms\nj who took part in the exhibition. The\nindustrialists themselves, despite the\nfreezing cold in the exhibition\nmarquee, were impressed by the\neffort put in by RS M students to make\nthe event run well. It was also a good\nopportunity for students to meet\npotential employers.\nMost of the people taking tours\nround the departments, guided by\nstudents, were sixth former s, a reassuringly large proportion of these\nwere girls. Representatives of a couple of trade magazines also turned\nup. The De La Beche (Geology)\nSociety provided coffee, while Chaps\nsold burgers.

He suggested that 'toilet\ntraining' could be arranged for some\nof the offenders.\nMr Howgate has replied by\na polo gi sing for the damage caused\nand indicated that he is tracking down\nthose students concerned.

There is the\nadditional burden of a \u00a3500 loss made\non the Freshers' dinners this year.\nR CSU Honorary Junior Treasurer\nDavid Williams said yesterday that\nthe main debts arose during the period\nof office of the former R CSU Senior\nTreasurer. They have only come to\nlight in the last year when Dr Ken\nBignal took over the job of Senior\nTreasurer. He discovered that no\nCollege bills had been paid and that\ndinner monies had not been collected.\nLast year when the debts were\nunearthed it was decided that all the\nUnion's assets would be realised. The\nUnion still owes College over \u00a35000\nwhich will have to be paid back as\nsoon as possible.\nMr Williams believes that the debts\narose due to 'bad attitude in the Union\nabout spending'. Most sections of the\nUnion have overspent. He said that\nas soon as this year's allocation runs\nout clubs, activities and publications\nwill have to stop.\nGas alert\nA spray can containing a tear gas\nderivative was let off at the end of a gig at the University of London Union\n(ULU) last week.\nFollowing an argument between\ntwo women after the band, one of\nthem let off a 'mace spray',\ncontaining the gas, in the other's face.\nThe sprays are intended to be used by\nwomen in case of attack, and although\nthey are illegal in the UK they are\nfreely available on the continent.\nThe spray was completely emptied\nwhich, in the packed hall, caused a very unpleasant effect and the room\nemptied '.cry quickly.

    "content": "ers Pro flan s... Dear Judith,\nAs a member of Mech Eng 1 and Guilds Hitsquad I found Mr Dyson's letter fascinating. The whole idea of\nfl anning is that a friend can demonstrate friendship or an\nenemy despite (I decline to classify Mr Dyson's case) by\npaying \u00a31 to charity. One assumes that all students wish\nto contribute, whether actively hitting or passively being\nhit, to the Rag effort. If they do not wish to be hit for\nwhatever reason (whether it is on grounds of health, ability\nto cope with the experience, being a humour less bastard\netc) they can purchase immunity. For those sporting\ncharacters who wish to join in the game but fear for their\ncontact lenses, badges were also available which would\nprevent the Hitsquadders from going for the face. The\nsame holds true for glasses. So, when the time comes for\nthe hit to be executed wearers of glasses and contacts are\nsafe as are people with immunity. If the victim hasn't bought immunity then it is both superfluous and fun-destroying to have to ask him beforehand whether he is\ngetting flan ned. 'But I didn't know', cries Mr Dyson to which my reply\nis that there were posters all over College, announcements\nin FELIX and Guildsheet and little people in masks,\nscarves and white coats trotting around College fl anning nine people in Mech Eng 1 before Mr Dyson's turn came\nround. The other 4,500 students in College knew that it\nwas going on, why not Mr Dyson? Is he totally oblivious\nof what goes on around him? ('Yes' scream those who\nknow him!) I do sym pathis e with his anxiety about his\neyesight and it would indeed be tragic if anything should\nhappen to him. But that's what immunity is for and with\nthe best will in the world one can only do so much in the\nway of enlightening and warning the general populace\nwithout sending every student a personal message\nannouncing the fact. (Our Dep Rep did in fact make an\nannouncement before one of our lectures so, in effect,\neverybody did get a personal message!) I regret any\ninconvenience caused to Mr Dyson and hope that next year\nhe'll be better informed. This letter should help him\nremember if he bothers to read it.\nYours sincerely,\nManthos 'Max' Kallios, Mech Eng 1.\n...Anti Igor...\nDear Judith,\nI wish to clarify a few points raised by Mr Dyson in\nlast week's issue, regarding the fl anning of poor\ndefenceless students such as himself.\nFirst of all, it seems ludicrous to me that he did not know\nanything about the Hitsquad, since it had been advertised\ngreatly during the previous weeks. I am a member of Mr Dyson's Mech Eng class, and I know of ten people in this\ngroup who were members of the Hitsquad and who freely\nlet people know what was going on. There was also a clear\nposter on the noticeboard outside ME220, where most of\nhis lectures are held. If Mr Dyson wanted to partake in\nany university life then it was his responsibility to read\nthe noticeboard\u2014no one else s. This, allied with previous\npublicity in UG Ms, the Freshers' video, Guildsheet and\nFELIX show that Mr Dyson has a blinkered and totally\nnaive life.\nSecondly, I would like to point out that I was a member\nof the Hitsquad, taking out many hits during the week,\nbut unfortunately not Mr Dyson's. He writes of medical\nproblems, and I do sym pathis e with him. I would like you\nto know, however, that three years ago I had 'major'\nsurgery to my nose which means that I quite often have\nnosebleeds if it is knocked, as could quite easily happen\nwhen carrying out a hit. This can be a 'traumatic\nexperience'. Due to the fact that the operation also\ninvolved plastic surgery, the skin around my nose is\nallergic to shaving foam. This proved to be quite\nuncomfortable when wearing a shaving foam covered scarf\nacross my face. So, Mr Dyson, why are you so uptight?\nI can only assume you have an inferiority complex. I can't imagine what you would be like if your doctor told you\nthat you wouldn't breathe through your nose again if it\nwas broken. That's what my doctor told me.\nIf Mr Dyson had come out of hibernation to notice all\nthe Hitsquad publicity, then he could have obtained a warning badge from the Guilds Office and we would take\ncare when hitting you not to get the foam in your eyes,\nas I'm sure the many victims with contact lenses will\nconfirm. Neither do we hit anyone hard intentionally. It\nmay only happen by accident if the student retaliates.\nLastly, I am one of your fellow residents at International\nHall, and I do not mind going back every day, smelling\nof shaving foam and sweat after hits. After all, it is for\ncharity, and a lot of people have some good laughs about\nit, especially the people who paid for the hit (usually\nfriends), and usually the victims themselves. It is not just\nthe people in the Hitsquad who have the fun.\nSo come on Mr Dyson, how about joining in with life\nfor a change. University life is not all work and no play.\nThese are my own opinions and nothing to do with the\nUnion.\nWhat a pity you don't know who paid for the hit. Not\nmentioning any names, if you had any common sense you\nmay work out that your laboratory group had something\nto do with it.\nYours,\nAn Official Guilds Hitsquadder.\nIn a good cause?\nDear Igor,\nI was deeply hurt and almost fear-stricken by your cold\nand cutting letter in last week's FELIX. Its content was\nboth factually inaccurate and heartbreaking.\nI, for one, should know exactly what occurred as I actually carried out the hit. Firstly, you were obviously\naware that the Hitsquad were 'on manoeuvres' since you\nshouted, T can see you down there waiting for me' when\nyou first sighted me. The fact that I replied, 'Don't worry\nwe're not waiting for you', is irrelevant!\nOn your arrival at the ambush point, my partner and\nI approached you and flan ned you on the top and back\nof your head. You had actually be^t over and covered your\nface before we made the hit so 1 can honestly say that the\nonly time you had foam on your face was when you last\nhad a shave\u2014you do shave, don't you?\nOn a less technical note, it sounds like you can't take\na joke, you've got one hell of an imagination and you're\nincredibly square. It's no wonder that someone took out\na contract on you.\nFinally, if you were the slightest bit interested in Guilds\nyou would know about the hard work that we and the other\nCC U's put into Rag to raise money for some very worthy\ncharities.\nYours,\nKMcC.\nSmall Ads ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022 Restringing of squash and tennis rackets.\nContact P Skipworth via Chem Eng 2 letter\nracks.\n\u2022 Party?

Nick\nFranks and Bill Lieb of Imperial\nCollege found a protein that was\ninhibited directly by a wide range of\nanaesthetics. This was a striking\nresult. It overturned previous notions\nabout the nature of proteins.\nCompared to the lipid bilayer protein\nmolecules are rigid constructions; it\ncame as a great surprise to see a protein pocket, which was designed\nto fit one particular compound,\nbinding a whole variety of\ncompounds, namely anaesthetics.\nThis remarkable protein is firefly\nluciferase, an enzyme which cat aly ses the light emitting reaction of luciferin,\nATP and oxygen (fireflies use the\nlight to recognise each other in the\ndark). It showed a sensitivity to the\npresence of anaesthetics not seen with\nlipid bilayer s: at concentrations of\nanaesthetic which normally induce\nunconsciousness the light output of\nthe reaction is reduced by fifty\npercent. Franks and Lieb showed that\nanaesthetics block the reaction by\nbinding to the hydrophobic pocket on\nthe protein normally reserved for\nluciferin.\nOf course firefly luciferase is not\nthe site of anaesthetic action since it\nis not found in the brain. However it\ndoes not seem unlikely that a protein\npocket like the one on luciferase could\nbe found one or several of the\nthousands of proteins known to be\noperational in the brain.\nCut-off\nThe concept of the protein pocket of\nfinite size as the site of anaesthetic\naction is proving useful. It can be used\nto account for the phenomenon 'cut-off. This is observed, for example,\nwith long chain alcohols: do decano l is a very potent anaesthetic (only a tiny concentration is needed to\nanaesthetize) but tetra decano l, which\nis actually more hydrophobic, is not\nan anaesthetic at all. The anaesthetic\npotency of long chain alcohols\ntherefore 'cuts off for molecules\ngreater than 12 carbon atoms in\nlength.\nAn anaesthetic is driven into a protein pocket mainly in order to\nremove its hydrophobic surface from\ncontact with water (or the aqueous\nenvironment of blood). The strength\nor tightness of this binding is\ndetermined largely by the surface area\nwhich is removed. This interaction is\na reversible, dynamic one; molecules\nconst andy enter and exit the pocket\nbut at any given moment a certain,\nfixed proportion of the available\nanaesthetic molecules is bound. The\ntighter the binding, the greater the\nproportion bound.\nIf one assumes that do decano l fills\nthe pocket then tetra decano l will not\nbind any tighter since it can only\nremove the same surface from water;\nthe rest sticks out of the pocket (see\nFig 2). Therefore the same proportion\nof molecules is bound to the protein.\nHowever the total number of\ntetra decano l molecules available is\nless because it is sixteen times less\nsoluble in water than do decano l. Consequently a much smaller fraction\nof the protein molecules is\nin activated \u2014not enough to shut down\nthe cell. Lipid theories have yet to\nsuccessfully account for 'cut-off\nbecause tetra decano l is actually more\nsoluble in lipid than do decano l. Nonetheless the debate goes on.\nFor example, anaesthetized laboratory\nanimals wake up if they are subjected\nto high pressures: will protein\ntheories be able to account for this socalled pressure reversal? Luciferase\nmay provide the answer. One thing\nis certain though: protein theories\nhave dramatically altered the\nlandscape of anaesthesia research and\nalthough the true mechanism of\nanaesthesia has not yet been sighted,\nwe are probably much closer to it.\nStephen Curry, Physics PG.\nUNDER MICRO\nTHE by Steve Black\nI would like to thank Stephen Curry, who is a postgraduate in Biophysics,\nfor the article on anaesthetics. He works in the group that has done the work\non Luciferase and is currently pursuing other useful ways to explore how\nanaesthetics work. I am willing to bet, though, that no theory of anaesthetic\naction explains how some Imperial College lectures can induce selective\nunconsciousness in the higher reaches of the brains of their students.\nAnyone else out there who is doing interesting work, is welcome to write\nabout it; I am always happy to receive contributions. I can be contacted on\nint 4642, via the FELIX Office or the Chemistry postgraduate letter racks.\nBritish science and CERN\nLast week's New Scientist contained an editorial opposing any moves to pull\nout of CERN, the European Particle Physics laboratory. There were very few\ngood arguments in it. Personally I'm against it, and here are my reasons.\nThe reason why some people are considering pulling out is simple: SER C, which has to pay the subscription, no longer has the money. Last year, exchange\nrate fluctuations increased the sterling cost of the CERN subscription by rather\nmore than SER C had left in the bank. The government only stepped in at\nthe last minute to make up the difference: if they had not, then SER C would\nhave been unable to fund any other new science in the UK this year. Even\napart from such crises, many people think that there is simply so little money\navailable for science that something big has to go; the quality of all our science\nwill suffer if it does not.\nSo what excuses are there for giving CERN priority over the rest of British\nscience? First there is the political argument: international cooperation is good\nfor us; prestigious international collaborative projects promote world peace\nand harmony etc... If this is true then the Foreign Office ought to be paying\nfor it, after all, that is where the money from other countries often comes from.\nThe other main argument is based on the popular appeal of Particle Physics.\nThe fascination with fundamental things is supposed to be one of those primal\nurges driving people into science in the first place. Good Horizon programmes\nare made about Particle Physics, and lots of people watch them. Supposedly,\nif we abandon a popular area of science, then fewer people will want to do\nscience. To me, \u00a365 million seems rather a lot for the scientific equivalent\nof the sex symbol.\nA less and less frequent iy used argument is the one that says: Particle Physics\nis bound to discover something useful someday. Nobody believes this any more.\nHistorically, high energy Physics gets the money because it is an offshoot\nof the nuclear weapons programme, and because so many of the people in\na position to make decisions were involved with the programme. But it now\nconsumes far too much and is giving nothing back in return. There are plenty\nof other areas of science where the same amount of money would yield very\nconsiderable returns. Chemistry, Electronics and Geology, for example, are\nall critically short of money now. All these put together probably don't spend\nas much as CERN; all would show large returns of useful science for small\nincreases in money spent.\nIt will be bad if Britain has to pull out of CERN: Particle Physics may be\nuseless, but it is fun and it is good for scientists to work in multi-national\ngroups. It is also a lot better than spending the money on Star Wars. It would\nbe embarrassing to the country, and to the Government if SER C decide to\npull out. But if the Government refuses to give SER C enough money they\nwill have no choice: banging particles together may be fun, but it's not worth\ndestroying the rest of British science for.\nFELIX Friday 4th December 1987 7\n\n"
