    "content": "Eating In\nEAT IT!\nRefectory Guide\nThere are many food outlets in\nCollege, and they all cater for\ndifferent tastes. The outlets also vary\ngreatly in price, food quality, and\nquantity. It is therefore advisable to\nshop around, and pay careful\nattention to the price lists, as it is\npossible to eat on less than a pound,\nbut also easy to spend up to three\npounds on food which has little\ndifference in nutrition, or quantity.\nBelow is a summary of the major\nfood outlets, along with indications\nof their cost, quality, healthiness,\nand portion sizes. The star system\nis from one to five, with five\nshowing the highest merit.\nGardens\nThis is the main refectory under\nSouthside, and serves meals of the\n'school dinner' type. Food served is\nof the meat and two ve g type during\nweekends, but during weekdays\noverpriced salads can be obtained.\nThe food quality is generally poor,\nbut the quantity is good, and the\nprices although high, are not\nextortionate.\nCost\nQuality\nHealthiness\nPortion size\n***\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\nRecommended meal\nPotatoes beans and ve g(91p) QT (McNortheys)\nSituated in the JCR, this is the worst\nfood outlet in the whole of college,\ncombining high cost, small portions,\nand low quality. This is a take-off of\nthe large fast food chains, and sells\nburgers, bap s, fries and a selection\nof cakes. Unfortunately water is not\nprovided at this outlet so you will\nalso have to buy a drink.\nCost\nQuality\nHealthiness\nPortion size\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nRecommended meal\nGo somewhere else (zero pence)\nMain Dining Hall\nThis is on the ground floor of the\nSherfield building, and is split into\ntwo main areas:\n1) Main Food Bar\nThis serves food of similar form to\nGardens, and has roughly the same\ncost and portion size. The food does\ntend to be fresher than in Gardens,\ndue to a faster through flow of\npeople.\nCost\nQuality\nHealthiness\nPortion size\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\nRecommended meal:\nPotatoes beans and ve g(91p)2) Pasta Bar\nNext to the main food bar, this\nserves a large range (usually four or\nfive) of different pastas. This outlet\nis notably cheap, and the food is\nfilling. On the other hand eating a full plate of pasta can prove to be\nmonotonous. The pasta is generally\nboth hot and fresh.\nCost * * * *\nQuality \u2022 \u2022 *\nFlealthiness \u2022 * +\nPortion size\nRecommended meal\nPlate of any pasta plus 1 slice melon.\n(\u00a31.40)\nSorry! There's some food on your fly!\nCome on over to my place?\nBelushi's Situated in Southside Bar, this\noutlet serves pizzas, salads, and\npotatoes. The outlet is open during\nbar opening times, seven days a week, and proves very popular with\nboth drinkers and non- drinkers\nalike. The pizzas and salads are\nfairly expensive, but the potatoes\nare notably good value.\nCost\nQuality variable\nHealthiness * * +\nPortion size variable\nRecommended meal\nSpud with anything.\nCaterpillar Cafe (Union Snack Bar)\nThe only union food outlet, situated\non the ground floor of the union\nbuilding. The food presentation is\npoor, and portion size is small, but\nthe quality can be quite reasonable.\nThis outlet doesn't provide water,\nalthough this fault could easily be\nrectified, but drinks are reasonably\npriced. Unfortunately the vegetarian\nfood is overpriced, and sometimes\nis more expensive than meat based\nmeals. This outlet is run in a similar\nway to Belushi's, and has a fairly\nvariable menu. Unfortunately it fails\nto attract as much custom as it\nshould in the evenings, probably\npartly due to the unpopularity of the\nBar.\nCost\nQuality\nHealthiness\nPortion size\n***\nvariable\nvariable\nRecommended meal\nOne of the set meals (80-90p) For the future\nUnion Outlets\nHopefully the Union will keep\nlearning from it's mistakes, and\nexpand the caterpillar cafe, maybe\nenlarging the custom of the newly\nformed MTV lounge. Also portion\nsize could be increased without\nlarge increases in cost. Although the\nBar has been refurbished it is still\nvery synthetic, has no corners to\nhide in, and no con for table seating.\nThe lighting is too strong, and either\ndimmed lighting or spots would\nimprove the atmosphere. Also I would say the lowering of the\nceiling was badly done as it is still\nvery high. Hopefully these will be\nchanged in the future, so as to\nimprove both trade, and viability of\nthe Union outlets. The way to turn\ntosses into profits, is to have a decrease in cost per meal, increasing\ncustom and therefore maintaining\n'current expenditure.\nCollege Outlets\nThe College outlets could probably\ndecrease their prices further, and\nthey have regular custom, so\nwastage should be low, and they\nhave bulk buying power. Gardens\nrefectory needs to take a look at the\nfood it is providing, as it is no longer\npopular during evenings and weekends. Perhaps more food of\nthe 'b angers and mash' type could\nbe provided so as to use the obvious\nmarket for cheap food that exists in\nthe halls. It is important that the\noutlets cater for the people they\ncould potentially s eve, otherwise\nthe massive advantages of bulk will\nsoon be lost.\n\" FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nMore Saridakis\nSirs,,\nThe apology to Dominic O 'Kane has been made\nthrough FELIX and therefore I feel that there is\nno more grounds for me to take legal action in\ndefence of his (and PATA's) interests.\nI could take legal action on similar grounds for\nmy letter being obviously falsified (my English\nis bad but understandable nevertheless) and my\nX ray photograph being disadvantageously\naltered, to hide the fact that I am a homo sapiens\nsapiens (twice) of height lm60. As for your operator's allergy, I wish to defend\nmv self: my ambition was to create a regular\ncolumn ('Saridakis' Letter') within you letters\nsection, to promote a common sense (a nonsensical, depending on a scientist's definition\nof 'sense') approach to College life.\nYou are complaining about the apathy of IC\nstudents whilst you thank your writers for their\narticles every week. You also encourage new\nstudents to join FELIX: what is wrong therefore\nwith my glorious name? If you want to give me\nanother column instead of 'Letters', or even print\nonly my initials, I don't mind.\nIf you knew me personally, you would know\nthat I am a rather shy, non-violent person, with\na slight dismay towards dogs: Your ' Woof feature instead of my letter, though pleasing for\nALF( 'dogs enter higher scientific education'),\nwas therefore doubly insulting to me.\nIn doggy faith yours,\nSaridakis Emmanuel, Physics I( Biophysics group-dogs' behaviour).\nGrant Askant\nDear Sir,\nI'd like to take this op port unu ty to answer some\nof the points raised in last week's letters page.\nFirstly I'd like to correct Paul Tubman's presumption that I believe that no one from a low\nincome family goes to University. I am from a low\nincome family, indeed my father generally works\nover 50 hours a week, takes one week's holiday\na year and still earns less than I can easily pick\nup on graduation.\nI believe that the problem facing Higher\nEducation is how to increase student numbers\nand especially- how to increase the numbers of\n'lower class' students. I believe that the best way\nto do this is to introduce students loans. Now I realise that this is not a popular view in College,\nafter all it is hard to argue against someone's self\ninterest.\nPerhaps we should look at the rest of the world\nto support my view. As Stephen points out,\nBritish Higher Education is better funded than\nin the rest of Europe, yet produces less students.\nIt is the grant system which artificially limits\nstudent numbers and produces the much derided\n'elitism' of the present Higher Education system.\nThe evidence from abroad would also seem to\ndestroy the argument that loans discourage\nstudents from poor backgrounds, the rest of\nEurope has many more 'lower class' students\nthan we do.\nTo answer Stephen, I don't want to see a world\nfull of 'engineers, a count ants and lager louts'\n(although a few more engineers would not be a bad thing). Loans need not discourage students\nfrom studying the arts because loan repayments\nare deferred if you earn less than 85% of the\nnational average income.\nFinally I'd like to point out to Mark that no one\nhas lost out from tax cuts for the rich. Since tax\nrates have been lower tax revenues have\nincreased substantially, allowing more to be spent\non such things as the NHS and Higher\nEducation.\nTo finish I'd like to say that I agree that the\nletters page is probably not the best place to\ncontinue this discussion so I'd be happy to take\nup Mark's offer of a chat over a pint.\nYours,\nAhsley Unitt, DoC 3.\nTantrum\nEditor,\nOn behalf of the sincere students at IC I apologise to the students of St Mary's.I accept that your Union secretary behaved\nbadly, but he did nothing in comparison to the\nactions of ICU. We have suffered from an election committee\nwho have shown all the love of democracy that\nPresident Marcos showed to the people of the.\nPhillipines.\nWe have suffered from a FELIX Editor, who\nactively biased the outcome of aUG M by\n'advising' students how to vote.\nAnd we have suffered from a majority of\nstudent at IC who have the same mean-minded\nself-interest that Mary's students are accused of.\nICU democracy is dead.\nI have burned my Union card.\nSimon Cholerton,\nPhysics 3.\nElections blah\nDear Bill,\nFurther to the UG M's upholding of Elections\nCommittee's ruling not to consider the St Mary's votes, I feel I must write to explain the reasons\nfor this in the hope that the issue is considered\nwith respect to the election only.\nMany people feel that the decision simply\nrepresented the UG M'sn on cha lent and destructive attitude towards merger with St\nMary's, yet it only upheld a decision which had\nbeen passed through Executive and Elections\nCommittees and more importantly arose due to\na recommendation by myself as Chair of the latter\nsubsequent to a complaint from a candidate.\nApart from the poster indicating certain\ncandidates as preferable which was put up by\nGraham Price, the SM HMS U Secretary. I heard\nvarious reports that people at St Mary's had been\ntold which way to vote.\nThis situation is not necessarily one which I blame on the Mary's Exec. Certainly, I feel that\npeople elected to such positions should have\nmore sense, yet it is ironic that the problems that\nhave arisen and will probably affect merger\nnegotiations might not have occurred had the\nmerger already place.\nIn the light of the situation and without blaming\nanyone, I felt that there was no alternative but\nto discount the votes, drawing the analogy that\nhad C&G Union put up a similar notice, the\ncandidate who referred the Mary's matter to the\nU GM would have been the first to storm into my\nOffice had his name not appeared on it.\nIf it is any consolation, counting the St Mary's votes could not have resulted in their preferred\ncandidate for President being elected.\nI am very sorry that these problems occurred\nand hope that next year'sHon Sec will have an\neasier time.\nYours sincerely,\nIan Morris, ICU Hon Sec.\nSt Mary'sv IC\nDear Mr Goodwin,\nAfter many months of trying to avoid writing\nto FELIX in order that no 'slang ing match'\nbetween our institutions could be started in a forum that allows no discussion, I have finally\ndecided to write. (Bill\u2014I respect your Editorial\npower and will not complain if you do not choose\nto publish).\n1 have only one thing to say about the 'rigging'\nallegations and that is there was definitely no\nUnion meeting to discuss who to vote for. I could\nargue more but at the end of the day the election\nis over, and, rightly or wrongly, a decision was\nmade in as near a democratic fashion as is\npossible at IC.\nThe Merger? Well in my opinion it is not going\nto happen. When I ask 'the people' that Mr Motteram seems incessantly to talk about, they\nsay they don't want to merge and that appears\nto be true of IC students as well. I am afraid that\nI have been guilty(?) of listening to the ICU Exec\nand as u ming that they represented student\nopinion at IC and very helpful (and skillful)\nnegotiators they are. However, it seems that IC\nstudents want us as much as we want them\u2014\nquite understandably really as logically I see no\nreason for us to merge in fact I can see many\nreasons why we should not:\n1. Each Union has a long history. This means\nwe have our own procedures and rules. At Mary's we run more efficiently as we have no\nsabbaticals and do not come under the blanket\npurchasing rules of IC\u2014per capita we have less\nmoney and achieve more in the way of sporting\na citi vi ties and political campaigns. That is not\nmeant to knock ICU who, with a larger institution\nto look after, have many more committees etc to\nattend.\n2. The Institutions are on separate sites.\nRegardless of what the more senior\nadministrators say about cycling at Eddie Merx\nspeed across the park we will not integrate to any\ngreat extent as we each have our own social\ninfrastructure and one is no better than the other\nin providing for what their students want. Also\nthe merging of clubs is a non-starter, our clubs\nare successful and an integral part of Mary's with\na proud tradition. Would the RS M Rugby Club\nmerge with ICRFC, I think not and they are on\nsite! We each have our own superb sporting and\nother clubs to merge them for the sake of saving\nmoney would be nothing short of criminal.\n3. We have separate Concerns.

    "content": "Focus on women\nLaying myths to rest\nHow do the current female students at Imperial College (IC) see\nthemselves? What do they think of the men at IC and what do they believe\nthe men think about them? Liz Warren interviewed some of them to find\nout.\nHow do you see yourself?\nA choice of several adjectives was\noffered. Almost everyone saw\nthemselves as intelligent, which is\nprobably not surprising as they are\nstudying at Imperial. Most of them\nfelt they were quite self-confident\nand strong willed: obviously un confident women do not come\nhere.\nMore than half saw themselves as\ntalkative, which at least goes to\nshow that when men accuse women\nof this fault women are aware of it!\nPerhaps most surprisingly, in a place where women are supposed\nto have problems, all of them felt\nthat they were on the whole happy.\nAlthough all the women interviewed believed in equal\nopportunities, less than half would\ndescribe themselves as a feminist\n('one who advocates equal rights for\nwomen' Collins English\nDictionary). This is undoubtedly\ndue to the connotations of\nextremism and in disc ri mate man-hating that the word has acquired\nover the years.\nFinally, one myth should be laid\nto rest: women do not come to IC\nbecause there are five men to every\nwoman. All the replies to the\nquestion, 'What were your reasons\nfor coming to IC?' mentioned the\nacademic reputation of the College,\ntogether with some women who\nsaid they wanted to study in\nLondon, but nobody gave 'the ratio'\nas a reason.\nWomen in the Union Bar-in their traditional role?\nSocial Life\nEverybody seemed to have more\nmale friends than female friends,\nand most of them seemed to think\nthey had more male friends than\nthey would have done outside IC.\nGiven the imbalance in numbers\nthis does not seem strange. Most\nwomen didn't seem to notice 'the\nratio', certainly not academically.\nSome of them felt it could make\nUnion parties unpleasant, whilst\nothers felt that as the women tended\nto be more sociable it was less of a problem than the basic numbers\nmight suggest. It was also suggested\nthat 'it would be less of a problem\nif it wasn't discussed so much' and\n'there are more men than women\nhere. So what!' Life scientists said\nthey certainly didn't notice it.\nMost women felt the social life\nwas on the whole good, but that it\nwasn't really provided by the\nUnion, and that one had to either\nbe in a good hall or make one's own.\nMost women felt their was little\nstrain in social ising, but some of\nthem felt that some men could\nbecome 'desperate' and very\n'predatory'.\nAlmost everyone felt that\ncontraception was the responsibility\nof both partners, while most felt that\nabortion was the resp on sibi l ty of the\nwoman only, although a large\nminority felt that both men and\nwomen should be involved in the\ndecision.\nDo women still see IC like this?\nWork and Career\nMost people felt that men and\nwomen treated each other equally\nacademically, although there were\na few who thought that perhaps\nboth sexes had an over inflated view\nof the other's ability. Certainly\nnobody thought that men looked\ndown on the women at College.\nThere was a feeling that women in\ngeneral performed better than men,\nbut only because they were more\nhighly motivated when they applied\nto IC and also perhaps because 'they\nhave more to prove'.\nMany felt that some women\nexploited their fem in it y in an\nacademic environment, but that\n'fortunately, they are in a minority'.\nEverybody wanted to get a job\nafter leaving College, with a number\nwanting to do research. They were\nsplit evenly on whether they\nwanted to get married, although\nnobody would give up work simply\nbecause they had got married.\nOn the question of whether or not\nthey would have children, a third\nsaid yes, a third said no and a third\nsaid they weren't sure. Those who\ndid want children still wanted a career and most of them would only\ntake a career break of about five\nyears. Nobody expected their\nhusband to give up his career for the\nsake of the family.\nIt was pleasant to discover that\nalmost no-one had been\ndiscouraged in wanting to study\nscience, though those that were\nseemed quite angry about it. A large\nproportion of women had\nattend ended some sort of sixth form\ncourse to encourage girls into\nscience, and most said that that had\nbeen very encouraging.\nWomen at IC are self-confident and strong willed\nShould women come to IC?\nQuite a number said that it would\ndepend on what sort of personality\nshe had and that if she was 'arty'\nshe should go elsewhere. There\nwere a few emphatic no's, but the\nreasons given were mostly to do\nwith the high cost of living in\nLondon and the academic pressure\nat College, which they felt was\nresponsible for turning out rather\nodd people anyway. Half the\nwomen questioned said yes:\nLondon was a good place to be, and\nthat the degree was well respected.\nThere's hope that one day 'the ratio'\nwon't be discussed because it'll be\none to one.\nPage 20 FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Focus on women\nWomen at IC\nWhere girls become men?\nby Liz Warren\nThere are roughly five times as many men at IC as women. How does\nthis imbalance of the sexes - 'the ratio' - affect life at IC? Can things be\nsaid to be improving and what are the opinions of the women currently\nstudying here? Liz Warren investigates.\nWomen have attended courses at\nthe various colleges and institutes\nwhich were the forerunners of\nImperial College almost since their\nfoundation.\nAnnabella Home ria Pollock,\naccompanied by her father, and a Miss Woolston attended classes in\nNatural History in 1851.\nThere were one or two women\nstudents in subsequent years,\nincluding Elizabeth Garret\nAnderson, who went on to become\nthe first woman doctor to practice in\nBritain.\nThe first woman to actually obtain\na qualification was Elizabeth Healey,\nwho became an Associate of the\nRoyal College of Science (ARCS) in\n1884. By 1907, when Imperial\nCollege was founded, about\neighteen women had taken the\nARCS and there were about nine\nwomen still studying at the college,\nall in the RCS.\nIC has thus never been an entirely\nmale preserve, but it has certainly\nbeen a male-dominated one. The\nfirst woman to gain a degree in Mining was Julie Ann Wilson in1963; first class honours in Electrical\nEngineering were only awarded to\na woman, Susan Crease, as late as\n1975. Yet in other ways Imperial has\nbeen very advanced in encouraging\nwomen scientists throughout its\nentire history. Dr Annie Whitely\nworked for 36 years in the\nChemistry Department, having\nreached the position of Assistant\nProfessor upon her retirement in1934. She was instrumental in the\ninvention of new methods of drug\nsynthesis during the First World\nWar, and was also a founding\nmember of the Imperial College\nWomen's Association (ICWA).\nI CW A existed to promote social\ncontact between women at Imperial.\nIt had its own room in. the Union\nBuilding (which is now part of the\nUnion Office) and its President sat\non Council to represent women's views to the Union. It was disbanded in 1981, its functions\nbeing taken over by Women in Science and Technology (WIST), a Social Clubs Committee Club. WIST\nhas never really replaced the\nfunctions of ICWA, being viewed as\na much more radical feminist\norganisation and not appealing to\nsuch a wide range of women\nstudents. The loss of representation\nof women in the Union was felt and\nresulted in the post of Women's Officer being created in1985. An interview with its current holder,\nGill Knowles, is included in this\nfeature.\nDespite these efforts by the\nUnion, it will perhaps surprise\nmany students to learn that women\nwere not allowed into the Union bar\nuntil as late as 1972, when a group\nof women students discovered that\nthere was no actual bye-law\npreventing them drinking there and\nproceeded to 'invade' the bar every\nnight for a week, much to the\nSome boys and girls\ndisgust, it seems, of the men drinking there.\nThe number of women students\ncontinued to increase slowly, from\nabout 25 in the thirties to about 70\nin the fifties, with the number of\nfull-time women students (under-graduates and postgraduates)\nexceeding 100 in 1959 and passing\n500 in 1977. There has been a rapid\nincrease over the past ten years and\nthis year saw the number of women\nstudents top 1000, an increase of\nabout 10% on the previous year.\nThis rapid increase is almost\ncertainly due to the College's strong\nattempts to recruit more women\nthrough efforts such as the IC\nWomen into Science and Engineering (ICWISE) courses for\nsixth form girls. ICWISE is described\nby its current organiser, Margaret\nCunningham, in an interview\nelsewhere in this feature.\nOne of the great steps taken by\nCollege in acknowledging the need\nfor more women at IC and in\nrecognition of the special problems\nthey will encounter as a minority\ngroup was establishing the College\nTutor for Women. Sandra Dawson,\nwho has held the post since it was\ncreated, was interviewed b v FELIX\nand describes how she sees her role\nin College.\nSo much for history. How do the\nwomen of IC see themselves to dav? What do they think of the social life?\nMore importantly, would they\nencourage other women to come\nhere? Perhaps one day there will be\nequal numbers of men and women\nhere and the issue of women at IC\nwill no longer be an issue.\nEditorial\nWhen I first thought up the idea for\nthis feature, I had an initial\nhypothesis that IC somehow made\nwomen more 'masculine' through\nbeing in such a male-dominated\nenvironment - hence the main title\nof this feature. I had been brought\nup on the diet of 'oh, with the ratio,\nwomen must have problems; they\nall become either honorary men or\ntoken women'.\nWhat I have discovered is that IC\nattracts women who seem more\nassertive than most, almost certainly\nas a consequence of the science-based nature of the College, but it\nis also something that is true of them\nbefore they arrive. College does not\nseem to have any effect on them\nbeyond what might be expected\nfrom attending any other university.\nI do worry that College, in its\ndesperation to attract women students to IC may paint too rosy a picture of life here. Women may not\nhave problems because they are\nwomen, but they are still likely to\nhave problems because the v are\nstudents.\nA friend of mine who was helping\non the ICWISE course last year said\nthat when he talked to the girls\nduring mealtimes and explained the\nproblems of high rents in London\nand high academic pressure at IC,\nhe was taken aside b v some of the\nlecturers and told, 'Don't tell the\ngirls that, we don't want to put\nthem off.' Do we really want to lure\nwomen, or indeed any student, to\nIC under the pretence that\neverything in the garden is rosy only\nto disillusion them with the realities\nof student life in London when they\nget here?\nHaving said that, I don't want to\ndiscourage anyone from coming\nhere if they're fully aware of what\nit's like. I 've certainly enjoyed my\ntime here.\nElizabeth Warren\nCredits: I'd particularly like to thank\nRichard Williams for all his kind\nhelp in the College Archives, all the\npeople who gladly gave me their\ntime to be interviewed and Bill, who\nhelped and supported me while I wrote this feature.\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

A lack of time had meant\nintensive practise over the last few\nweeks for the team and this seems\nto have paid off with Chris Edwards\ngaining the-highest individual score\nof 51 points.\nThe rest of the team (Claire\nRulten, Nick Battersby, Steve\nCiargeft and Kevin McKoen) all\npicked up good scores. This was in\nthe face of difficult and unusual\nwines, especially in the whites\nwhere a tricky Alsace was thrown\nin. The reds, although easier didn't include the usual Gamay, which\nproved upsetting, especially for the\nCambridge team.\nOverall, IC got 170 points with\nCambridge trailing behind on 110\npoints, and not a bit pleased with\nsecond place.\nThjis win comes as a welcome\nboost to the Society, currently under\nthreat of having its grant withdrawn\nby IC Union for the purchase of\nwine, proving to those who doubt\nthe Society's integrity that they are\na worthwile and educational\norganisation.\nWinning competitions such as this\nincrease the Society's already high\nstandard in the trade. The aim of the\nSociety is to give all its members a chance to taste a wide variety of\nwine, reflecting the many difficult\nstyles of wine available. Only by\npurchasing quality wine can the true\ncharacteristics of a region or grape\nvariety be shown, so the Society is\nheavily dependent on its grant. (It\nshould be noted that the practise\ntasting s were funded independently\nby the small number of'members\nwho attended.)\nIf the Society loses its grant, it\ncould mean the end of a prestigious\nSociety whose reputation in university wine tasting is second to\nnone.\nKevin Barker of Peter Dominic Wine\nMerchants interviewed by Jens\nPeterson.\nThe Imperial Wine Tasting Society\nhas bought wine from Kevin Barker\nat Peter Dominic on several\noccasions. 1 would like to stress that\nI'm totally independent of the\nSociety and have not participated in\ntasting sessions.\nDo you believe that this quantity is\na large amount for a Society like\nthis?\nFor thirty students who only taste\na small amount of each wine? Well\nyes, that should be about right.\nOut of interest. What quality wine\ndoes the Society buy?\nIt's rare that they buy cheap wine.\nThey tend to go for slightly more\nexpensive wine which, by most\npeople's standards, is in the upper\nend of the market.\nDo you bele ive that Imperial\nCollege Wine Tasting Society is an\nexcuse for a party?\nDefinitely not. It's costing them\nsomething. It's not exactly as if\nthey're guzzling wine down.\nDo you recognise the importance\nfor students to sample wines?\nOf course.\nIf students want an alcoholic drink\nthey could go to the pub. Why should College give them the\nchance to drink wine?\nThey're not drinking wine, they're\ntasting it. It's useful to discuss the\nproperties of wine. I could open a bottle now and taste it myself, but\nI'd be far wiser to share it and find\nout other opinions. That's what\nmakes it interesting. The wine\nmarket constitutes a massive trade.\nIt also has become a hobby for many\npeople. It really is a recognised\n\u2022 trade.\nDo you find that trie present\ncommittee are incompetent?\nThe three girls that come in, you\nmean? They have asked me for a discount and I 've given them one,\n7% I think. However, I don't think\nthey know the power that the ii Society holds. They could probably\nget an even larger discount if they\ncame forward and put forward their\ncase.\nAre you surprised that Imperial\nCollege Union finance have plans\nto withdraw some or all of its grant\nto the Wine Tasting Society?\nI hadn't heard about that. But yes,\nI am surprised. There are probably\nother areas within your university\nwhich are not so important as the\nWine Tasting Society.\nThank you very much for your\ntime.\nSez Wilkinson\nThis week FELIX presents gorgeous pouting Sez Wilkinson.

    "content": "Science\nS CIE NCE AS WC approach Easter\n'that most be_e88 ed time of ye ar' the FELIX Science Page investigates\n1 TI Revenge of the\n\\MZ killer eggs\n'Much of the egg production in this\ncountry,' said the minister, 'is,\nsad lv, infected with Salmonella'.\nThese words, broadcast country-wide, led to an unprecedented\nnationwide panic attack, the\ndestruction of thousands of hens\nand the paying of hundreds of\nthousands of pounds in compensation to disgruntled farmers.\nThe incident will go down in political folklore as a classic example\nof starting the mouth before\nengaging the brain. But the ill-starred Edwina may have done us\nall a favour: most of Britain now\nknows that Salmonella is highly\nvirulent, can quickly evolve\nresistance to treatment, and has\nbeen found in 80% of poultry flocks.\nIn the UK during 1987 there were\nabout 18000 recorded cases of\nSalmonella poisoning, an increase of\nover 20% on the year before. People\nhave been known to fall ill after\ndigesting as few as ten bacteria.\nThe bacteria is a mutation of the\n'useful' Escherichia Coli (E. Coli)\nbacteria, part of the digestive\nsystem, and like E. Coli it lives in the\nguts of many species of animal. The\nbacteria finds the gut the ideal place\nfrom which to attack the host and\nfrom which to spread back into the\nenvironment and into other food.\nOne Salmonella carrying chicken\ncan easily and rapidly infect a whole\nflock.\nCorpses of slaughtered animals,\nand even the milk from infected\nherds of cattle can contain living\nInput Picture this: the scene, a dingy\nlaboratory full of large machines and\nflashing lights. In one corner stands\nthe mad scientist, giggling manic ally, about to perform some\nhideous experiment on the helpless\nheroine. He reaches for a large lever\non the wall and pulls it down.\nMachines buzz and sparks fly. In\nthirty seconds, she will be beyond\nhelp.\nSuddenly, in rushes the hero, his\nbacteria, bacteria which can eventually find their way to\nhumans.\nThe key to the bacteria's survival\nis adaptability. There are many\ndifferent species each of which\ninfects food in a slightly different\nway. Salmonella enter it id is, the one\nheld responsible for Currie's eggs,\nis the most common iti this country.\nThere have also been recent\noutbreaks of the rarer Salmonella\npara ty phi and Salmonella saint-paul, the latter affecting one\nhundred people who had eaten\ncontaminated bean sprouts. There\nare few foods which cannot contain\nsalmonella.\nThis may explain how people\nbecome infected, but in recent years\nthe number of cases had dramatically increased. There must\nbe some change in the nation's eating habits which makes us all\nmore vulnerable. Many researchers\nnow believe that it is the fault of the\nfridge.\nIn recent years the number of\npeople buying and then cold-storing food has increased\ndramatically. This, like all other\nfood, is susceptible to Salmonella\ninfection. The difference is that such\nmeals are often kept for long periods\nof time, all too frequently where it\nis warm enough for the bacteria to\ngrow. Edwina's eggs are as prone\nto infection as anything: the inside\nof the shell is an ideal breeding\nground.\nIf the food is thoroughly cooked,\nas per the governments post-panic\nsmile glinting. There is a fight: the\nhero gets the upper hand, the mad\nscientist fights back. There are just\nseconds to spare. In a last desperate\nto save his true love, the hero strikes\nthe scientist who staggers back, trips\nover a chair and falls into a vat of\nsulphuric acid. The hero rushes\nacross the room, pulls the lever just\nin time. The heroine is saved and\nthe world is again at peace.\nOK, so it wouldn't win an award\nfor originality. In fact, the above\ncould be a scene from any one of\nhundreds of films, books, plays and\nthe like, and is typical of the bad\npress scientists seem to receive.\nHow many celluloid scientists have\nadvice, most Salmonella should be\nkilled. However if, as normally\nhappens, the meal is stuck in the\noven or on the cooker, left for half-an-hour and eaten, enough may\nsurvive to make someone ill.\nThere are no guaranteed ways of\nstopping animals becoming infected\nwith Salmonella. Researchers are\nworking on 'cocktails' of organisms\nwhich colonise the gut to the extent\nthat no other bacteria can gain a foothold. This is not without its\nflaws, Salmonella are rapid adapters\nbeen mad, bad or misguided? How many have planned to take over the\nworld? The list is endless.\nFv\u00b0n when the scientist gets to be\nthe g./ od guy, he, and it is almost\ninvariably a he, either spends the\nwhole film working on the antidote\nto a mysterious alien disease or\nhaving his mind drained by invading green blobs while some\nhunk with the brain of an amoeba\nfights off the menace. The worst of\nthe lot are the happily-married-with-son brigade from 50s American\nScience Fiction: 'Gee Pa, did you\nhave a good day at the u tomic rocket\ntesting ground?', 'Sure did son,\nhow was your day?', 'Gee, it was\nand can quickly become resistant to\na particular cocktail. Despite this,\nthe Germans have enough faith in\nthe technique to make it compulsory\nfor all cattle to be vaccinated. The\nBritish Government, true to form,\nis doing nothing and this time, there\nmay be no political gaffes to make\nthen sit up and take notice.\nDuane Wircire\nswell, I saw this spaceship land in\nthe back garden.', 'Sure son, just\nyou get off to bed.'\nWe have been typecast. How can\nthe general public trust anyone who\nseems simultaneously to want to\nrule and save the world. Scientists\nmust learn to communicate and,\nhere's the plug, one way to do this\nis by writing. The FELIX science\npage will accept articles from\nanyone on anything vaguely\nscientific. Old lab. reports or tutorial\nessays, if they are interesting, will\nbe lapped up.

Devoid of any\ncommendable morals, he still seeks\nhis princess, unable to see how bankrupt his soul has become\nduring the pursuit.\nThroughout the film Duruddere\nmanages to-bring Bukowski's text to\nlife, injecting wit, pain, anguish and\nan overall sense of the impossibility\nof innocence.\nThe film examines and exposes as\nfalse, the ideas we have about how\nsex should be embarked upon and\nalso that classic of modern cinema\nnarrative 'The male friendship'.\nDespite being involved in three\nclose m le friendships, Vos is rarely\ncomforted or helped by their\nintervention. He is only made more\naware of his shortcomings.\nUnfortunately, the advertisers\nhave sought to increase this\nexcellent film's success by\nproclaiming that it is 'sexually\nexplicit' and 'strictly for adults only'.\nThe explicitness of the film is\nemotional, not sexual, and the\ncapability to endure this is not\ngoverned by age.\nNoel Curry.\nThe Adventures\nof Baron Munchausen\nBaron Munchausen told stories. So\nincredible were these stories that a play was written about them.\nMunchausen lived in the 18th century and fought for Prussia\nagainst the Ottoman Empire; for\nMunchausen fighting the Turks\ninvolved flying to the moon, talking\nto the gods in Mount Etna and\nsurviving being swallowed by a giant fish.\nThe film starts in a besieged town\nruled by an elected civil servant. In\nthe middle of the town is a theatre\nwhere a performance of\nMunchausen's stories is taking\nplace. The public love the play,\nexcept for the one Baron\nMunchausen. The Baron stops the\nplay and tells it how it is. Munchausen insists that he started\nthe war by enraging the Sultan and\nthat only he can stop it. In order to\nbeat the Turks, Munch a use n escapes the town in a balloon made\nof knickers and sets out to find his\nold servants. The Baron has a stowaway\u2014the ten year old daughter of the theatre boss.\nMunchausen and the girl, Sally,\nbring together a gang of four nearly\nsuper-human men who are now all\nold and weary. All is not lost though\nand their adventures give the Baron\nyouth so he and sally can inspire the\nlittle band of men. The Turks are\ndefeated and the town is saved.\nEx-Python, Terry Gilliam, directs\nthis lavish, comic and theatrical film.\nThe expense (\u00a343 million) is always\nevident in the sets, costumes and\neffects. The style of the film is\nreminiscent of the theatre where the\nfilm starts. Similarities to both Brazil\nand Time Bandits are clear; Gilliam\nsees these two and Munchausen as\na trilogy. It is all good to look at,\nespecially Venus.\nThis film ponders a little on the\nlink between fantasy and reality,\nbeing the story of an old man who\nlives forever though his fantasies.\nEssentially-it is a comic adventure\nwhich, although not a laugh a minute, is sometimes hilarious and\nalways sumptuous.\nPatrick Smith.\nPREVIEW\nThe Dead\nPool\nInspector Harry Callahan (Clint\nEastwood) is back on the streets of\nSan Francisco, dispensing his usual\nmix of justice and violence, as ever\non the edge of trouble with his\nsuperiors and City Hall.\nHarry is now a media celebrity\nand if something should happen to\nhis well-being the ratings are liable\nto soar. Bored movie director Peter\nSwan (Liam Neeson of Prayer for the\nDying and Suspect fame) draws up\na list of the ten people least like lv to\nsurvive the year, and Callahan is at\nthe bottom.\nAs you might guess, there follows\na series of violent murders as the\nmembers of the list are eliminated\nin sequence. Swan is prime suspect.\nHarry sets out to find the real\nculprit, but it is only a matter of\ntime, before he will become the\ntarget.\n'\u2022The Dea4 Pool is the fifth of the\nDirty Harry films, and the first since\nSudden Impact five years ago. Once\nagain it is set and filmed entirely on\n'location in and around San Francisco.\nAfter his political ex cus ions to\n. secure the local ice-cream parlour,\nClint Eastwood has returned to\nmake just what you'd expect. The\nstor v includes the clich ed foil of the\nnervous young partner and a romantic interest in the form of TV reporter Samantha Walker (for once\nplayed b v Patricia Clarkson and not\nSondra Locke). And of course, there\nis a large measure of death and\ndestruction.\nThe Dead Pool was received poorly\nin America, but for all its\noverworked and stereo tv ped substance it can still claim Mr Eastwood, and he remains one of\ncinemas biggest crowd pullers.\nRelease date April 14.\nAndrew Clarke.\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 33\n\n"

Secretary\nof State for Education, Kenneth\nBaker announced the plans at the\nConservative Central Council in Scarborough last weekend, after a group of MPs tabled a resolution\ndeploring the automatic NUS registration of students' at NUS affiliated student unions.\nThe last Union General Meeting\n(UGM) saw the election of next\nyear's Union Officers, with a large\nnumber of posts remaining vacant.\nSez Wilkinson was elected as\nExternal Affairs Officer, Hal Calamvokis as Rag Chair, Adrian\nPagan as Accommodation Officer,\nNocola Fox as Women's Officer and\nStephen McCabe as Ents Chair.\nAlthough there were candidates\nstanding for the posts of House\nCommittee Chair and U GM Chair,\nNew Election won more votes in A recent cut in the funding of IC's Geology department by the\nUniversity Grants Committee( UGC) has caused severe staff\ncutbacks. The cuts have resulted in\na reduction in the number of subject\noptions Imperial can offer Geology\nstudents.\nIn an interview with FELIX, the\nHead of the Geology department,\nDr Richard Selley, said that the\ndepartment will lose 10 academic\nand 13 non-academic support staff\nbetween June 1988 and October\n1989. The loss may reduce the\n.number of options available to\nsecond year Geologists from 7 to 3.\nThe 4 courses due to be axed have\na low number of students. The\noption cuts are due, in part, to staff\ncuts and the need for the\ndepartment to improve its strength\nin the field of research geology for\nfuture UGC assessments.\nIf an option cannot be offered by\nImperial's Geology department, it\nis hoped that students will be able\nmoves\nSpeaking at the meeting, Mr Baker said the action would be\nguided by the basic principle that it\nis wrong for State money to be used\nfor political campaigns when it has\nbeen provided for students' welfare\nand support.\nDismissing reports that his top-up\nloans scheme had been rejected by\nthe banks, Mr Baker also insisted\nthat legislation for the loans will go\nahead in the Autumn.\nboth cases. These posts will be open\nto re-elections, as will a number of\nother posts for which no candidates\nstood. These include Academic\nAffairs Officer, Internal Services\nOfficer, Post-Graduate Affairs\nOfficer, Industrial Relations Officer,\nICCA G Chair and Welfare Officer.\nAnyone wishing to stand must sign\nthe papers on the board in the\nUnion Building and must have five\nsecond ers who are current members\nof IC Union.\nto attend courses in other University\nof London colleges, primarily\nUniversity College, Birkbeck College\nand Royal Holoway and Bedford\nNew College. The students' tutors\nare to organise the restructuring of\nthe courses.\nWhen interviewed by FELIX,\nsecond year Geology students said\nthat they were only recently\ninformed of the reduction in the\nnumber of options. Of the 40 or so\nmembers in the second year, 10 are\ntaking the Mining Geology course,\nwith a fixed set of options. The\nremaining 30 were asked to fill in a form expressing their respective\nchoices. With the forms processed,\nthe second years have been\ninformed that only three of the\noriginal seven options are to be run.\nThe decision has upset a number\nof the Geology staff as well as the\nstudents. A petition has been\norganised to express the students'\nopposition to the line of action.

A full investigation\nis likely but a spokesman for the\ncentre told FELIX that the\nprobability of accidents is 'minimal'\nand stressed that it is the first\naccident to happen at Headcorn in\nthe 10 years it has been open.\nmajority of the Geology department's staff said that they\nwould run lecture courses in all\noptions if there was any demand.\nThe feeling in the Geology\ndepartment is that the UGC grading\nand subsequent cuts in funding, are\nunfair since the review of the\ndepartment was primarily carried\nout on the basis of pure research\nGeology, as opposed to applied\nGeology, where Imperial has its\ngreatest strengths.\nImperial's Geology department is\none of the largest and best equipped\nin the country and is one of the few\nwith facilities for carrying out\nstrength testing on rocks.

    "content": "Opinion\nSatanic verses There is an uproar in the media and\nthe public alike, about the novel\ncalled Satanic Verses, although very\nfew people seem to understand the\nfact that we have been addressing\nthe wrong issue so far i.e., the\nfreedom of speech. The fact of the\nmatter is that it is not the right of the\nfreedom of speech per'se that has\nbeen contested by those who\ncondemn Satanic Verses; in fact it's just the opposite ie, the abuse of this\nso-called freedom, which has met\nwith the most severe confrontation,\nand understandably so. The\nquestion we have to address is; does\nanybody have the right to speak\nwithout due regard to the\nconsequences?\nDo we have anything like\ncomplete freedom? Why do we have\nlaws of blasphemy and a race\nrelations Act in this country, all of\nwhich curb the freedom of\nexpression? Is there any prc eden t in\nthis country where books have been\nremoved from the shelves in the\npublic libraries?\nOf course, without laws there\nwould be complete anarchy. All speakers, actors, writers etc must\nhave a responsibility in what they\nare doing. It's disheartening to\nknow that the law of blasphemy in\nthis country is based on\ndiscrimination without due regard\nto faiths other than the Christian\nfaith. This needs immediate\nattention, and the right of everyone\nto be free from abuse and insult\nmust be respected, irrespective of\ntheir faith. Clearly the government\nhave shown double standards in\ndealing with the issue of Satanic\nVerses. Does the establishment who\nsacked her minister because she said\n'the eggs are contaminated' and\nwho spent millions to silence Peter\nWright have the right to lecture\nabout freedom of speech?\nAs for Rushdie's book, it is not\nabout satanic verses. It is an attack\non Islam in the guise of a novel in\nwhich he insults the muslims and\ntries his utmost to give a distorted\nview of history and Islam. He\nridicules the religious consciousness\nof muslims and is guilty of\nblasphemy. Based on his book and\nhis comments, both on television\nand the newspaper, he is guilty of\napo stacy. This is an extreme form of\n'treason' and carries the retribution\nof Capital Offence according to\nIslamic Jurisprudence. There are\nother books critical of religion but\nthey are objective. This one is\nabusive, racist and slanderous. For\nexample he refers to one of the\nProphet's black companions as a 'black monster'.\nSo disgusting is the style that an\nEnglish speaker, while commenting\non the book, said T would like to kill\nhim for his appalling use of\nEnglish!'.\nMr Rushdie and his associates\nwere invited to the Central Mosque,\nin London, in October to discuss the\ncontents of his book. He completely\ndeclined to accept. A Sikh leader\nhad also advised him not to go\nahead with the publication but he\npaid no heed. It was clear to the\npublishers that the material will be\nhighly offensive. So clearly, the\nstake was financial. This is therefore\na case where the writer has not only\nignored but deliberately slandered\nand insulted the faith of 1.30 billion\npeople.\nLet me take this opportunity to\noffer the respected reader a quote\nfrom the letter of the Provost of\nBirmingham Cathedral, Mr Peter\nBerry, who wrote in The Times,\n'The West has become used to\nreligious feelings being 'optional',\n'extra', 'marginal'. May God's peace and blessings be with Mr Peter Berry, as he has spoken the\ntruth in a world of widespread\nmoral laxity. After all, the real\ncommon ground that the people of\nEast and West may have is in the\nrecognition of one God. About the Author; MB Khan\ntravelled from Afghanistan to\nPakistan before the Russian\ninvasion. He completed his first\ndegree at the University of Punjab\nin Chemical Engineering before\ntravelling to US where he completed\nan MS and where he also worked\non a US Dept of Energy research\nproject on Synthetic Fuels. Mr Kahn\nis currently per suing his PhD in\nPolymer Engineering at the Dept of\nChemical Engineering at IC. He is\nalso a consultant with the Pakistan\nSpace and Upper Atmosphere\nResearch Commission.\nIs the Oath on the Bible inherently\nblasphemous?\n'Will you take an oath on the Bible?'\nthey say, though even the most\nardent blasphemer, long since\ngrown out of being ticked off with\nsupernatural cautions from his\nelders and betters lest he tell a porky, feels himself shunted into a corner and thinks he does his\nhonour a disservice by allowing\nhimself to bow down to taking an\noath which they proffer to him. He\nrightly sees no ease in refusing for\nthe extra nuisance it will cause is\nsomething he can well do without\nand there is no dignity to be gained\nby contravening himself by\nprotesting he is an atheist simply\nbecause his view of God is not a view they share. So what is he to do\nif he is not to be reduced to the\ntaking of empty oaths?\nHere is my considered opinion.\nIf his demean our is nothing which\nwill work to his disadvantage or the\ndisadvantage of anyone close to his\nheart he should vy el come the\nopportunity to take the Oath, he\nshould grin broadly and say 'Sure!\nPass that Bible over. I 'll most\ncertainly take an oath on it! Why I 'll\neven spit on it if you would like me\nto.'\nAnd if his demean our is\nsomething vital then let him request\nthat the Court be adjourned for at\nleast three weeks to give him time\nto read the damn thing, small print\nan' all, before he signs his Pact with\nthe Almighty. Is there a Court in the\nLand which could afford to refuse\nsuch a simple request?\nMy point is, of course, that the\nCourt itself treats an Oath on the\nBible with the most contemptuous\ntriviality. And this is proven by the\nlaw of Perjury, which, I contend, is\na blasphemous law by all noble\ndefinitions of the word 'blasphemy'.\nAnd there is little point in any\ndefinition which is not noble. The\nLaw of Perjury assumes that the fear\nof God is sufficient to enforce the\ntelling of the truth but God is not\nsufficiently mighty to chastise those\nwho lie. And so I say that the Oath\non the Bible is a wicked extorting of\nthe truth by a legal press gang which\ncruelly manipulates the honest faith\nof simple folk and wishes upon\nthem all manner of neuroses unless\nthey allow the State to stick its nose\ninto their business.\nAnd to cap it all, this truth the\nCourt perfidious ly expects will not\nbe freely given unless a threat of\ndivine wrath is brought o bear, a threat which the Court itself\nbelieves to be empty or it would see\nno need for a Law of Perjury.\nAnd even if the truth be freely\ngiven and under Oath still the\nCourt undermines the position of\nthe individual with regard to the\nposition of the State by retaining for\nitself the right to disbelieve what is\nsaid, whether under Oath or\nwhether on your Mother's Grave,\nb latent ly flying in the face of the\nfaith they expect us to put in its\nauthority in the first place. They\ndemand we place our trust in them\nbut do not extend the same trust to\nus and yet at the same time they\nhave the gall to claim to be the\nup holders of Justice. There is more\nhonesty of intention in a straightforward Kangeroo Court.\nEven so, if I am to be hauled up\nin front of one or the other then\nevery time give me a kanger oo court\nwhich does not see itself as such and\nI will hurl my contempt for it in like\nmanner so they cannot ever afford\nto see it as contempt as such.\nPage 26 FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Focus on women\nSandra Dawson\u2014College Tutor for Women\nSandra Dawson is one of two College Tutors who has special responsibility\nfor women, she is a lecturer in the School of Management and has held\nher post as College Tutor for the past two and a half years.\nWhat do you see as the central\naspects of your job?\nWhen I was first appointed two\nyears ago I felt that my main\nresponsibility was to ensure that the\nneeds and concerns of women\nstudents were acknowledged and\nmet.\nA lot of my work is seeing\nindividuals with particular causes of\nconcern and I 've also tried to set up\nnetworks of women students, so\nthat some of the isolation\nexperienced in some departments\ncan be overcome by introducing\nwomen students to women in other\ndepartments and other years. I think\nthere is a great tendency, with the\nexception of some of the more active\nsocieties, to become locked in a group such as one's year in the\ndepartment or one's hall.\nI 've also been concerned to try\nand attract more women to come to\nCollege through working with\nschools and also through the IC\nWomen into Science and Engineering Courses, which I think\nare excellent.\nDo you feel you have had any\nsuccess?\nAt the individual level, as I 've\nbecome more experienced in the\njob, I 've been able to provide help\nfor the minority who have problems\nof particular concern, which have\nvaried from personal relationships\nand h arras s ment in the broadest\nsense.\nAt the group level, it's been much\nmore difficult. The meetings I 've\norganised have only attracted\nminority support, but I think that's true of anything at IC.\nIn previous years there has been\nan informal postgraduate women's group and we're now trying to\nestablish one on a more settled\nbasis. This should allow more\ninvolvement of women post grads and they will be holding their first\nmeeting, which will be advertised to\nall women post grads, next term.\nIn the area of working with\nschools and trying to attract women\nto IC, we've found that the schools\nare very pleased to receive both the\nstudents and myself. I think the\nmajor problem is the educational\nsystem in this country where\nchildren have to make choices at 13\nor 14, but we're usually invited to\ntalk to the sixth form.\nI think it's very important to\nencourage women students to go\nback to their old schools (we can pay\ntheir travelling expenses and\nprovide them with literature and\nvideos). I think that women just two\nor three years out of school talking\nabout their experiences is\nimmensely valuable. Making students into ambassadors is far\nmore effective than me, Margaret\nCunningham, or anyone else talking\nto them.\nWhat specific events have you\norganised for women at IC?\nWell, basically the work I 've\ndescribed above. I 've also invited\nnew women students to meet me\nand other first year students and\nI 've tried to bring the activities of the\nstudent group Women into science\nand technology to the attention of\nwomen students.\nWhat do you see as the main\nproblems facing women at\nImperial?\nI think that in some departments it's still very much a man's world,\nparticularly because there are so few\nwomen members of staff. The issues\nof career choices and life after\ngraduation are very important and\nI don't think there is a big enough\nvariety of role models. The work of\nHUB (run by the Rector's wife,\nClare Ash) is vital in contacting\nfemale ex-members of the\ncommunity (both staff and students)\nand organising lunches with discussion of women's careers.\nThere is also the possibility of setting\nup a Women's Alumnae Group,\nwhich could help in introducing\nwomen students to the range of\nopportunities facing them after they\ngraduate.\nI think that some women students\nare isolated to a degree, whereas\nmen are less isolated. Statistically\nthere is more chance of men\nencountering staff and students\nwith whom they can discuss their\nconcerns. I think there's now quite\na sharp split between departments\nsuch as Life Sciences in the Royal\nCollege of Science and the\nEngineering Departments.\nI don't want to stress the negative\nside. I think Imperial College can be\nan exciting and interesting place for\nwomen to be. We take intelligent\nand interesting women students\nwho want to make a go of it and I don't want to be an agent of doom\nand gloom about it.\nDo you think IC needs a Tutor for\nMen?\nMost of my work as a College\nTutor is not actually concerned with\nwomen, as I sit on committees such\nas Admissions Policy, Students'\nResidence Committee and\nUndergraduate Studies, although I do chair the Day Nursery Committee and I sit on the Rector's Working Party on the Recruitment\nof Women Students. I see myself as\na College Tutor, just with a special\nresponsibility for women.\n1 am persuaded that it's important\nto have the special designation of\n'College Tutor for Women' because\nof issues like sexual h arras s ment which may make many women\nworried about who they actually go\nand see, so it's a bonus for\nindividual work.\nWhat do you feel the attitudes of IC\ntowards its women students are?\nMany are positive, a few are\nnegative. I hope that by taking up\nspecific issues and by trying to stop\nisolation we can make it an even\nbetter place.\nSome departments have a Women's Tutor, but in most cases\nthe departments with women members of staff try to make them\ntake responsibility for the women\nstudents. The basic problem is that\nwe need more women staff, so that\nwe don't have to set up these special\narrangements. After all, if there is\none female member of staff there is\nno guarantee that she will be\nconcerned with pastoral or welfare\nissues.\nDo you feel it is a disadvantage that\nyou didn't study a science-based\nsubject?\nNo, I don't.I 've worked in the area\nof industrial studies for so long I feel\nI'm a member of IC, I don't think\nit's a matter for concern or\ncomment.\nDo you class yourself as a 'feminist'?\nI'm someone who shuns labels. I think they lead to more difficulties\nthan solutions. Personally, I think\nthat domestic life and professional\nlife are both important and I'd like\nto encourage women to see that\nthey can have a strong positive\ncombination of both. The critical\nthing is both individuals and\norganisations response to issues\nsuch as childcare: IC are extremely\ngood in that respect.\nI do bele ive passionately in\nequality of opportunity, and I believe that with the contribution\nwomen have to give to science,\nindustry or politics and the number\nof women who figure in significant\npositions in those areas, that a lot\nof talent is being wasted.\nSandra Dawson, College Tutor for Women\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 19\n\n"

    "content": "Planted 'shoplifters' show up poor security\nUnion loses \u00a37k+ over\nbookshop deficit\nLosses in Imperial College\nBookshop have left the Union out of\npocket by over \u00a37000. The losses\nwere announced at a meeting of the\nBookshop Committee last Thursday\nwhen it was revealed that the shop\nhad made a deficit of \u00a316,771 last\nyear.\nAn auditors report on the\nbookshop alleges theft of goods by\nstaff and customers; collusion\nbetween staff and customers leading\nto goods being undercharged, theft\nof cash by staff or customers and\nover payment of suppliers by\nmistake or ' in consequence of\ncollusion between staff and supplier.'\nSecurity has been highlighted as\none of the shop's weak areas and\nsecurity cameras in the store are\nreported to have been in operational for the past 5 weeks. The extent of\nthe problem was demonstrated at\nThursdays Bookshop Committee\nwhen Union Manager, Dave\nPeacock produced a collection of\ngoods which had been stolen by\nstudents on the Union's behalf.The\ncameras are now in the process of\nbeing repaired.\nBookshop Assistant Manager,\nAnn Toudup told FELIX that she felt\na great deal of the loss was due to\n'carelessness on the tills.' She added\nthat the Bookshop Manager, Roy\nHicks, had attempted to implement\nall of the orders sent to him by\nUnion Manager, Dave Peacock after\nthe auditors report.\nCashiers are now required to 'sign\non' and 'sign off their till rolls and\ntills are 'cashed up' every day.\nDespite the more stringent controls\nMonday's tills were short by \u00a350.\nIn answer to criticisms by the\nauditors that the Bookshopp carries\nan excessive amount of stock, Mrs '\nToudup told FELIX that the store\norders lecturers' recommended texts\nand tries to judge its ordering on\npast years. Tt isn't easy to judge'\nshe added. The auditors claim that\nthe shop's bank overdraft of \u00a318000\ncould have been reduced by better\nstock control.\nSpeaking on the Bookshop's loss,\nUnion President, Nigel Baker said\nTt is a problem m and we've got to\nget in there and sort it out. With the\nexpertise we now have in this office,\nwe believe we have the ability to do\njust that.'\nThe Union now intends to change\nthe Bookshop layout to incorporate\ntills at the exit and a better view\nacross the shop. An Electronic Point\nOf Sale till system has also been\nagreed to. Cashiers will be able to\nenter sales with a light pen, allowing\nfor more accurate till operation and\nbetter stock control. The system is\nexpected to cost in the region of\n\u00a35000.\nNews\nMines\nelect new\nexec\nRob Lowe, a Mining Geology\nsecond year has been returned as\nnext year's Mines President after a close election last Tuesday. Mr Rowe was standing against Matt\nJupe a Geology second year; both\ncandidates gained 78 votes leaving\nMines Hon Sec Eddy God with the\ncasting vote. Mr God voted for Mr Rowe on the grounds that he gained\nmore second votes than the\nopposing candidate.\nAnne Rothwell was returned as\nVice President with 73 votes to Eddy\nKiernons 35 votes and Dave\nMcMillan was returned as Honorary\nSecretary with 74 votes to Dave\nMcMillan's28. Also elected were Kate Knudson\nfor the post of Foreign Students\nOfficer, Warren Turner as Sports\nOfficer and JP Hansen as\nNewsletter Editor.\ning boring boring boring bor ir Monday Night saw Imperial College\nUnion Council head off to Silwood\nPark for its annual token gesture to\nPostgraduates. After much um-ing\nand er-ing and delegation of proxies\nthere were enough Council members to make the meeting\nquo rate. Sensibly, the\nPostgraduates at Silwood stayed\nwell clear of the proceedings.\nThe meeting kicked off with the\nPresident who reported that, in the\nwake of moves by Imperial College\nUnion, the NUS were considering\ntaking legal action against the\nAssociation.\n'Perhaps we should invite the\nNUS to join us' suggested a drunk\nDave Williams.\nThe meeting proceeded with\nCouncil mandating Nigel Baker to\nseek legal advice on wether it was\npossible to take out an in j uc ti oh on\nlecturers to force them to set\nexaminations.\nThe Unions decision to charge tie\nclubs for the use of the Union as a mailing address was vigour ou sly opposed by 22 club chairman David\nBurns. The motion was put forward\nby Math's Dep Rep Athos Ritsperis\nwho suggested that it was hypocritical for the Union to charge\nthe Christian Union (CU) for this\nservice when they did not charge\nother non Union Clubs. After a great deal of debate, during which\nthe FELIX Editor cast aside his\ntraditional neutrality to defend the\nCU, it was decided that clubs would\nbe allowed to use this facility free\nprovided they brought in more than\n\u00a3300 revenue to the Union.\nTwo new clubs were ratified by\ncouncil with little debate; University\nChristian Outreach and AISEC, a student business organisation.\nIt was then that SCAB chairman\nRoger Davies decided to play his ace\ncard by censuring the FELIX Editor\nfor forgetting to print his article in\ntwo consecutive issues.\nUnfortunately Council was totally\ndisinterested and the move was\ndefeated by abstentions after five\npeople u o ted in favour and five\nagainst.\nA motion to re-establish the Wine\nTasting Society grant which had\nbeen cut by the Union Finance\nCommittee on the grounds that the\nUnion should not fund 'a bunch of\npiss heads' caused a stir amongst the\nnow sloshed members of Council.\nUnion President Nigel Baker\nargued that Real Ale Society was not\nfunded and said that Wine Tasting\nshould therefore not be funded. It\nwas the Council Chairman, Neil\nMcClusky who came to the rescue\nby pointing out that Wine Tasting\nSociety could claim for entering\nstudents in competitions if they\nwanted to and that this would\nprobably cost the Union more than\ntheir subsidy. The motion was\nunanimously carried.\n'You've written a blank cheque'\nsaid Nigel Baker shaking his hands\nin disbelief before heading back off\nto the bar.\n'Fine, I 'll have a double' retorted\n22 president Dave Burns.\nAs the meeting consumed more\nand more alcohol the debate became\nmost protracted and less coherent.\nA motion calling for Social Colours\nto become the responsibility of\nindividual Major Sub Committees\n(MSC) was however passed despite\nNigel Baker's assurances that the\nMSC' s would receive no money to\nbuy Social Colours Ties.\n'That's just tough shit,' he said,\nbut by now Council had had too\nmany to care.\nBy far the low point of the evening\narrived when Hon Sec Ian Morris\npresented his report, which consisted of 65 policies which were\ndue for renewal or binning. By now\nit was 11.30pm and to expect\nCouncil to wade through all 65\npolicies was perhaps a little\noptimistic. A number of Council\nmembers made their feelings known\nas they stormed out of the session\nand into the bar to play pool.\nShouts of quorum were\nfast ideo us ly ignored by Council\nChairman Neil McCluskey who pointed out that as there was no\nway for Council to get back from\nSilwood without the Mini-busses\nthey might as well finish the\nbusiness.\nThirty six policies later, amidst\nmuch shouting from all and sundry,\nthe meeting degenerated\ncompletely. By now most of Council\nwas in a complete state of\ninebriation which prompted Deputy\nPresident Elect, Dave Williams to\npull himself from under the table\nand present a final motion.' I think we should limit the\nnumbers h of drinks h that Council\nmem be sh drink because its h just\nridiculous h.' Thank heavens its only three\ntimes a term.\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

As many\nof you will know, Dog biscuits are\nimportant for strong teeth and a shiny coat. They contain valuable\nminerals such as iron, calcium and\npreservatives such as sodium\nbenzoate which increases the\nnatural lifespan of our four legged\nfriends.\nThere are many different types of\ndog biscuit, for example bo nio which takes its name from Borneo,\nwhich is a country. Spillers produce\ntwo types of biscuit; ovals and\nshapes. The shapes are particular y valuable because they improve a dog's spatial awareness. They come\nin several colours and the following\nshapes; diamonds, bones, ellipses,\nand squares. But if you want to keep\nv our dog's coat very shiny there are\nno substitutes for charcoal biscuits.\nIt is a little known fact that King\nAlfred invented the dog biscuit in\n870 AD. The story is very long and\nboring which is why I must tell it\nhere. The King, under threat from\nthe Vikings was in hiding in a hut\nin a forest. Now, the lady who\nowned the hut, Mrs Spiller,\nhappened to be baking some cakes\nand she asked the king to look after\nthe oven for her.

    "content": "Reviews\nTwins\nHands up everybody who has been\non the underground recently but\nhasn't seen a poster for Twins. What\nwere you both doing? This movie\nhas more hype attached to it than\nArnie has muscles. There is a good\nreason: films this bad don't sell\nthemselves.\nJulius Benedict ( Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the perfect\nspecimen, and man of learning,\nstrength, vitality and inexperience.\nA product of genetic\nexperimentation, with all the good\nbits stuck together. He even walks\nlike Frankenstein.\nVincent (Danny DeVito) is his\nyounger twin, composed, it seems\nof the genetic garbage. Taken away\nfrom his brother at birth, Vincent\nhas lived a lonely life, through an\norphanage, and now steals cars to\npay off the loan sharks who are after\nhim.\nJulius arrives, looking for his\nfamily, and while his innocence and\nnaivety allow a couple of jokes\nbased on American culture, in the\nvain of Crocodile Dundee, they also\ngive Vincent an opportunity to\nexploit his new found sibling.\nAccompanied by girlfriends\nMarnie and Linday Mason (Kelly\nPreston and Chloe Webb), they\nembark on a journey to Texas. Julius\nis looking for his mother, Vincent is\nlooking for money, the women are\nlooking for love, the mob are\nlooking for Vincent, the hitman is\nlooking for Vincent, money and\nprobably a little love too\u2014he\nprobably never had a mother \u2014and\nthe audience are looking fruitlessly\nfor a halfway decent plot with some\nhumour.\nTwins was written especially for\nDeVito and Schwarzenegger. The\nidea came from director Ivan\nReitman, who also made\nGhostbusters and is now working on\na sequel. The pairing of the two\nstrikes an instant feeling of comedy,\nthe prospect of such opposites\nstarring together as brothers is too\nattractive for the public not to flock\ninto cinemas everywhere. The\ncharacters are even modelled on the\nactors to such a degree that the film\nproves to be exactly what you'd expect, except funny.\nThe message which the movie\ngives is the importance of family ties\nto a full and happy life, and the film\nis at least successful on that count.\nYou can't fail to notice Arnie's hefty\narm shoving that down your throat.\nEveryone concerned has achieved\nmuch better in the past, and\nconsequently this film is a disappointment. If vo u really need\na lesson in brotherhood then\nRainman is on around town, and far\nsuperior. Those of you who succumb to the hype, I hope vo u enjoy it more than I did.\nAndrew Clarke.\nCrazy Love\nNow showing exclusively at the\nMetro, is the startling debut of\nBelgian director Dominique Deruddere. Crazy lave consists of\nthree episodes, based on the short\nstories and writings of Charles\nBukowski, known to most as the\ncharacter who inspired (and wrote)\nBarfly. The narrative concerns itself\nwith the sexual escapades and\nfailings of Harrv Vos, during\nvarying stages of his life.\nVos is initially seen in a cutting ly accurate, but highly amusing, tale\nof a young naive teenager who\nbelieves ever v maria ge is like in 'the\nmovies', with princes fighting\nvalient lv for their princesses. The\nmood is pac v and light, as the film\nfollows the attempts of Vos' older\nand more experienced friend to\neducate Vos about the 'other sex'.\nA moment of sheer gripping terror\nas Vos makes his initial tumbling s towards the first kiss, is brilliantly\ncaptured. The tone becomes more\ndespondent though as his dreams\nare slowly shattered.\nVos next appears as a sensitive\nadolescent, who is suffering from\nthe most horrendous case of boils.\nIt follows his progress during the\nevening of his school prom. He is\nalmost total lv withdrawn and rejected, bar one friend who manages to instil hope in Vos,\ndespite his desperate situation. In a scene where Vos manages to finally\nFrom my point\nof view\nBy Stephen Berkoff, Man in the\nMoon Theatre Club, 392 Kings\nRoad, till March 25.\nSomebody give these people a decent script! The Volcano Theatre\nCompany erupt with guts and\npower. Thus its is a surprise to find\nthem squandering red hot larva into\nBerkoff's shallow and murky waters. Why such storm troopers\nshould be mounting a mercy\nmission to rescue this mortally\nwounded piece was a puzzle I couldn't solve. The vigour with\nwhich Fern Smith and Stephen\nFisher expand this play beyond its\nfalse promise leaves the impression\nof two doberman pinchers\nravenously devouring a slice of wet\nquiche. This is kiss ogram delivered\nby the S AS. Billed as a piece which presents 'a strong uncompromising and assertive image of women', what we\nget are the bitter recollections of a sadly exploited tart. Her's is the\nvoice of the major role and the voice\nof the narrative, (The two being\ncontrasted as colloquial slang\nagainst a weakly scripted\nheightened author i al comment.) In\nthe first half of the play Fisher acts\na caricature of a wide boy and Smith\nplays the abrasive young woman.\nShe takes us through the contrasts\nof love's aspirations and the sordid\nand disappointing realities of her\nown experiences: waiting hopefully\nby the phone for 'someone nice' to\nring; screwing surreptitiously\nstanding up in the hallway.\nIn the second half of the action\nSmith plays a woman's eye view of\na wide boy and Fisher acts a caricature of a shy wall flower.\nSmith swaggering menacingly as\nFisher loiters hopefully in the stale\nand boozy twilight of a Mecca disco\nnight. All of which is carved out\nbrilliantly in a stark choreography of\ncarnal lust and gender conflict.\nBut the rumble of the verbal\nassaults is robbed of all capacity to\nshock since this is an unintentional\nportrayal of the woman-as-victim. A habitual victim with the backlash'\nbitterness to match. She is the girl\nwith a reputation. She is Mary from\nEastenders. She is the girl who\nwants only love and who gets only\nsex. An unhappy 'adolescent' who\nhas failed to get a grip on her life,\nwho has failed to grow up.\nThe thing about a play concerning\na woman who has failed to grow up\nis that it has no audience. An adult\nwill only vaguely recall such\npubescent traumas and at best will\nrespond with backstage offers of\n' problem line' counselling\ntelephone numbers. A youngster,\nunless a victim of equally disastrous\nsexual first experiences, is unlikely\nto sym pathis e with the woman's point of view unless out of some\nmelodramatic sense of adolescent\ncomradeship The show is also billed\nas 'unsuitable for children', in a deluded over estimate of its ability\nto shock, thus excluding the final\nage group. (Although a few blasts\nof dinosaurs Gary Glitter and T Rex\nwhich punctuate the action should\nperform that task quite adequately.)\nThis is not the feminist play it\nmight seek to be. Women with more\ncharacter, resourcefulness and independence have lived in the\nmost patriarchal of times and civilisations. It is a terrible thing that\nsome women find themselves\nwithin a life which fits with\nBerkoff's pessimistic 'Point of\nView'. An unintended conclusion\nmight be drawn that the kinds of\nprogressive thinking typified by\nwomen's liberation are painfully\nslow to take on a reality amongst the\nworking classes whose intellectuals\nwere their original champions. For\nwomen in such a situation a note of\noptimism is the least that Berkoff\nmight have offered in his ill-advised\nblunder into difficult cross-gender\nterritory.\nDon't cancel any pressing\nappointments for this one but if you\nfind yourself near the Kings Road\nthen both the venue and the\ncompany deserve your support. The\nplay is only an hour long and gives\nyou the measure of this enthusiastic\nand energetic company.

    "content": "Satire\nFEU X22 MARCH 2019\nAs we near the end of this second decade of the twenty-first century, it\nis a fitting time to look back. What has happened to all those people who\ncontrolled our lives thirty years ago? The obvious answer, and the correct\none, is that they are all dead. So, instead, we will concentrate on those\nordinary people, the complete non-entities of 1989 as Tempus Futura\ncontinues his series:\nThirty years on\nNigel Baker\nNigel D. Baker was in what he\nbelieved to be the important job of\n'Union' President back in 1989. To\nus, living in these enlightened days,\nthis may seem strange. Many of us\nstill remember the banishment of\nScargill, the last of the Union\nPresidents, by the Great Maggie in\n1993. But the Union Nigel ran was,\nof a different sort, it could be\nLabour Party the night before the\nvote and the subsequent, valiant\ndecision by the government to\nstruggle on with the debate without\nthem. The vote in favour was\nunanimous, and Parliament, the\nbane of generations of Britons, was\nnever to be seen again.\nBut Nigel's political triumph was\nalso to be his downfall. With no\nParliament, he was without a job\ndescribed as the 'students's social\nclub of what is now 'Imperial\nCollege of Science, Technology,\nMedicine, Arts and Star Wars\nResearch pic'.\nHistorians are unsure of exactly\nwhat the 'Union' did: many of its\nrecords were destroyed when it was\nforced to close by Sir Kenneth Baker\nafter a later president, Red Nicola\nFox, was found guilty of communist\nsubversion.\nAt the close of his presidency,\nNigel took a highly paid job with\nMogul oil, but his true destiny lay\nelsewhere and within a year he was\nstanding for parliament.\nNigel was selected as\nConservative candidate for the Safe\nTory seat of Ridley on the Oouse\n\u2022 and was so successful that he was\neventually elected after the\nboundaries had been moved twice .1\nHe soon became a 'favourite of the\nPrime Minister and indeed it was\nNigel who was chosen to pilot the\nbill to abolish Parliament through\nthe Commons. The rest is history.\nChildren today are taught of the\naccidental mass arrest of the entire\nand after Lord Norman Fowler\nfinally removed the last of the\nscroungers and abolished the Dole,\nhe had no means of support. Nigel\nnow lives in a cardboard box on the\nroof of what was, before the Thames\nflooded, the Royal Festival Hall.\nWe at FELIX sent our ace reporter,\nSez Wilkinson Jr., to find Mr. Baker\nand ask him how he feels after all\nthese years. She found him in his\nfavourite spot on the far side of the\nbuilding and offered him a bottle of\nmeth s as an incentive but with no\navail. Nigel would only mutter\nvaguely about 'Bloody Goodwin'.\nA doctor, Dr. Philip Drew, was\nasked to examine Mr. Baker on behalf of FELIX. His diagnosis was\nnot hopeful, before our money ran\nout, we were told that Mr. Baker\nhad a severe mental problem\nmaking him an 'undesirable\nvagrant'. We had no choice but to\ncall in the Police and we are sorry\nto announce that Nigel D. Baker,\nformer president of Imperial College\nUnion was officially put down last\nTuesday.\nBill Goodwin William Robin Goodwin was one\nof the last of the so-called\n' independent' FELIX editors.\nIndeed, it was just two years after\nhis term that Rupert Murdoch\nbought up the newspaper and\nreplaced the editor with a computer.\nBills career had a less auspicious\nstart than Nigel. His first jobs with\nAlpen and the Pregnancy Advisory\nService were both terminated\nsuddenly and he was forced to\nreturn to the one job he was really\ncapable of.\nAs tea-boy on the ChippingSodbury Gazette, Bill met many\ninteresting people all of whom were\ngoing to later be better paid than\nhimself. He was, however, dogged\nand persistent and within a few\nyears he was making the coffee.\nBill's big break came when, on a fact-finding visit to Johnson's Breweries, the papers entire news\nstaff fell into a vat of lager and\ndissolved. The paper's owners, in\ndesperation, asked Bill to stand in.\nIt was a stroke of luck that Bill\nhappened to be in the 'Tebbit Arms'\nthat day, the very day1 that it\ncollapsed into the Channel Tunnel.\nHe was just leaving the pub when\nhe heard what he later described as\na' col los hal crash' and turned to see\nthe building and half the village\ndisappear down a hole.\nHe was thus, the first reporter in\nthe country on the scene and the\nonly one to file his report before the\nmilitary sealed off the area. His fame\nwas thus assured and he was soon\noffered jobs with the Guardian,\nIndependent, Times and, the one he\nfinally chose, with the Sun.\nAs the Sun's Arts and Culture\ncorrespondent he travelled the\ncountry writing, in his own unique\nstyle, of great events such as the Bob\nDylan' Walking Frame and Harmonica Tour' of 2001. It was\nafter this piece that Rupert Murdoch\nsacked him.\nBill returned to the ChippingSodbury Gazette to the post of tea-boy cum features editor where he\nremains to this day. Our reporter,\nSez Wilkinson Jr. tracked him down.\nSez Wilkinson adds:\nI found Bill Goodwin in the\nChipping-Sodbury Gazette offices\njust off Saachi Street. It was a pleasant change to get out of the\ntown: to see the great rolling\nexpanses of concrete that make up\nthe beautiful British countryside, the\nvast mock-georgian housing estates\nand even the occasional tree.\nChipping-Sodbury is a typical\nKentish village: a small community\nof stockbrokers and accountants\nliving traditional country lives in traditional country ways, their only\nmeans of communication the\ntraditional Fax machine.\nThe Gazettes offices are on the\nfifteen floor of Lawson Towers and\nBill's desk takes pride of place in the\nfar corner, just behind a row a filing\ncabinets and next to the loo. When\nI met him, he was asleep in his\nchair, silly hat covering his eyes.\n' Mr. Goodwin,' I said. He woke\nwith a start. ' My name's Sez\nWilkinson Jr. of FELIX'.\nFor a second he seemed engrossed\nin thought.\n'Wilkinshon, you shay. Didn'tI know your mother.'\nWith that, he offered to buy me a drink and I'm afraid that was his last\nintelligible statement.\nIan Morris\nIan Morris was Imperial College\nUnion's 'Honorary Secretary' at the\ntime of Nigel Baker's presidency. As\nfar as the historians can gather was\nsome kind of entertainments\norganizer and it was into the\nentertainments business that Ian\nwent at the end of his year in office.\nHis film company 'Wicked Wendy\nProductions' achieved both fame\nand notoriety with its original\ninterpretations many great works.\nFELIX obtained copies of many of\nIan's early works. However, the\noffice was recently raided by the\nWhitehouse-Rees-Mogg Thought\nPolice and the material has,\nunfortunately, been confiscated.\nIronically, it was a raid by the\nsame police squad that finally closed\ndown Wicked Wendy's for good,\nfive years ago. Ian now works as a doorman at the ' La Maison' in\nSoho.\nChas Brereton\nChas Brereton was Nigel's deputy\nin the late 1980s. His progress since\nthat time is shrouded in mystery.\nHe was reported to have first\nobtained a 'job in the City' but from\nthen on, no trace of him can be\nfound.\nSome historians were beginning\nto doubt that he had ever existed at\nall and one went as far as claiming\nthat he was a fictitious character\ninvented by FELIX as an object of\nridicule.\nHowever FELIX have traced him\nto a small company called 'Cosa\nNostra Properties' which appear to\nspecialise in import and export. The\nreporter we sent to interview him\ndisappeared and was later found as\npart of a bridge on the M1276\nmotorway. Since then three\ntypesetter operators have lost their\nhands in mysterious accidents and\ntwo printers have been found\nentangled in the press.\nFELIX regrets any inconvenience\nwe may have caused Mr. Brereton\nand wishes to announce that it is\nabandoning this line of research.\nPage 24 FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nHeart Attack and chips\nTake-away foods have a bad reputation\u2014but is it really deserved?\nThe short answer is YES!\nToday we spend almost as much\nmoney on fast-foods and takeaways as on cooking at home. After\nall, they are quick, convenient and\ncost little in time and effort. And there's so much choice! There are\nnear lv7,500 fast-food outlets in the\nUK, not counting fish and chip\nshops. Fast-food often gets a bad\npress\u2014but is it really all that bad for\nyou? Can you still eat the occasional\nhamburger if you're trying to live a healthier life?\nTHE LOWDOWN The reason most fast foods have a bad reputation is because they're\nhigh in fat. And eating a lot of fat\ncan increase your risk of heart\ndisease. Government guidelines\nrecommend that fat should make up\nno more than 35% of your total daily\nintake of calories. For example, if\nyou eat about 2,150 calories a day,\nthat shouldn't include more than\n84g of fat. If you eat a portion of\nchicken and chips (which contains\nbetween 45-56g of fat) or fish and\nchips (42-52g) you're getting\ndangerously close to your full day's allowance. You might think pizza is\na better bet. Not so. It's high in calories and because of all the\ncheese, the fat level can creep up to\n40ga portion.\nWhat about fibre? Will you get\nenough if you eat a lot of fast food?\nSadly not. You only get 3g in your\nfish and chips, lg in chicken and\nchips and about 5g in hamburger\nand chips\u2014not very good when you\nshould be aiming for 30ga day of\nfibre. Fast food often contains large\namounts of salt.

Wimpy and Casey Jones\nnow produce a bean burger with\nmore fibre and less fat than normal\nhamburgers.

Indian food can\nbe high in fat, so choose dishes like\nlamb tikka and tando ori chicken\nwhich are grilled in spices and\nyoghurt rather than cooked in oil.\nYou might also think Greek.

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nWomen This week FELIX presents an in-depth feature examining the the opinions\nand problems of women at Imperial College. As everyone knows, the 'ratio'\nis is the perennial talking point at IC, but surprisingly, most women do\nnot find the atmosphere at IC overly daunting.\nWhen it comes down to it, the problems that women face at Imperial\nare very much those faced by all students in heavily work orientated\nCollege in the most expensive part of the country. The 'ratio' can and\ndoes create problems for IC's male population and some men do leave\nthe College without any real idea of how to deal with women. A night\nspent in the Union Bar will confirm the sentiment expressed by some of,\nthe women FELIX interviewed that some men become 'desperate' and\n'predatory'.\nAnd yes, there are women who exploit the fact that they are female\nin a College full of males.\nThe College has done well in recent years to attract more women to\nImperial through courses for sixth former s such as ICWISE. Let's hope\nthe trend continues. Unfortunately\", the nature of society, which still pushes\nthe girls into arts and the boys into science, will mean it will be a very\nlong time before we can see males and females here in equal numbers.\nDrink\nI have been challenged by Fiona Nicholas, Hon Sec elect who would like\nto prove that she can drink more than me in order to raise money for rag.\nThe event will take place in the Union bar at the end of the year and rag\nwill be running a sweep stake on the outcome. In the meantime I will need\nto put some training in, so if you see me in the bar an alcoholic beverage\nor two would not go amiss.\nBlub Blu bB lub Scab Chairman Roger Davies is one of the most unpleasant, obnoxious\npeople I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.\nMr Davies is sulking because I forgot to print an article he wrote. So\nupset was he that he proposed a vote of censure in the FELIX Editor at\nlast night's council. The move was thrown out on abstentions by the\nmajority of Council, who quite frankly didn't give a shit about Roger or\nhis article.\nI have lost count of the number of times that I have pointed out in\nEditorials that I cannot r jar aunt ee to include articles in a given issue. Nor\nwill I promise not to cut or edit them.\nOddly enough, when putting together a twenty page FELIX there are\na far more important things to worry about than one shitty clubs article,\nas anyone who has worked on FELIX will testify. Ironically if Roger had\nput his article in the clubs or reviews pigeon holes like every other club\ndoes, instead of expecting it to be given some sort of preferential treatment\nit would have automatically gone through the system.\nIt seems that Roger has a chip on his shoulder and is intent on ruining\nthe good working relationship that FELIX has with Dramsoc. Thank\nheavens the rest of Dramsoc are not like him. I wonder what shit Mr Davies\nwill try and stir at the next Council; as far as I am concerned he can piss off.\nParty\nToday at 3.00pm in the FELIX Office followed by trip to TEXAS Lone Star\nant the Ferret and Firkin.

    "content": "Reviews\nINTERVIEW\nRain Man\nThey made for an unlikely-looking\ntrio\u2014the grey-haired, bright eyed\ndirector and the two actors, one\nyouthful and sporting a crew-cut\nhairstyle and permanent smile; and\nthe other middle-aged, lacking\nsomething in inches and hiding\n(rather unsuccessfully) behind what\nmay very well grow to be a beard.\nAnd yet the common sense of\ncontentment and relief shared by\nBarry Levinson, Tom Cruise and\nDustin Hoffman was there for all to\nsee, and the reason for this might\njust have something to do with the\nsomewhat surprising but\nundoubtedly emphatic and\ncommer ical success enjoyed to date\nby their new film Rain Man.\nComfortably seated in a plush\nsuite in London's Mayfair Hotel,\nDirector Levinson, sunglasses and\nall, betrayed none of the fatigue that\nhe must now be feeling after a rigorous promotional tour prior to\nthe film's British opening this\nmonth. He spoke in a relaxed\nmanner about the problems and\nanxieties which plagued the making\nof the film\u2014he was the fourth\ndirector to join the project, and he\nconfessed that 'If it had been one\nweek later, I would have had to say\nno'; such was the pressure of time.\nHe acknowledged that there were\nalways going to be inherent\nproblems involved in making a film\nabout autistic behaviour, but\nstressed that 'the movie does not\npretend to make a clinical study of\nautistic savants', and it was with\nobvious delight that he described as\n'one of the most pleasing things\nabout the movie' the very many\ncomplimentary letters he had\nreceived from parents of autistic\nchildren.\nHowever, Levinson reckoned that\nthe hardest aspect of making the\nfilm was 'trying to see if an audience\nwould be involved in two characters\nin a kind of evolution without any\nsort of plot-stuff, and he was\nunreserved in his praise of his two\nstars. When 1 asked whether he had\nbeen wary of working with an actor\nof Hoffman's 'reputation' he smiled\nand admitted 'I'd heard all the\nstories', but nevertheless remarked\nthat 'It was never a difficult\nsituation.. . in terms of a collaboration it was great.' More\ninterestingly, while acknowledging\nHoffman's greatness in the role of\nRaymond Babbitt, he refused to play\ndown in any way the contribution\nof Tom Cruise; 'The two of them\nmake the great performance\u2014it\ncouldn't have worked without Tom\njust as it couldn't have worked\nwithout Dustin.'\nThis view was echoed by Dustin\nHoffman himself; 'It wasn't just me\nplaying the part. Tom was playing\nthe part, the director and the crew,\ntoo.'. When asked how he had\n' found' the part of Raymond\nBabbitt, Hoffman replied simply,\n'Just with a lot of help!', I had a year\nof research\u2014not because I wanted\nit, but producers kept turning it\ndown!'. It was clear nevertheless\nthat his preparation had been\nmeticulous\u2014he spoke with feeling\nand knowledge about the problems\nexperienced by autistic individuals\nand about his many discussions\nwith leading medical experts'on this\nsubject; he emphasised that\neverything in the film (for instance,\nRaymond' s astounding mathematical powers and ability to\ninstantaneously count a pile of\ntoothpicks) was based on fact, and\nlamented the fact that T know that\nmost of those who see the film don't believe it!'.\nThe rapport between Hoffman\nand Cruise is crucial to the film, and\nit seems to extend to the actors' off-screen relationship as well. When I tried to suggest that they might have\nexperienced difficulties in regarding\neach other as brothers (at 51,\niii iii ft' Hoffman is twice Cruise's age),\nCruise (also wearing a pair of dark\nglasses\u2014do all Americans share the\nsame misconceptions about British\nFebruaries?) merely laughed at the\nsuggestion; T told him I didn't think\nhe looked that old!', while Hoffman\ndenied that it had posed any\nproblems, although he did admit\nthat T first thought ' How the hell\ncan we be brothers?\". Certainly, the\nresults are most convincing.\nNeither actor (both had been\ninvolved in Rain Man from very\nearly on and had to suffer the\nfrustration of constant set-backs and\nseveral changes of director)\ndisguised the fact that they had been\nfar from optimistic about the film's chances of success\u2014as they both\ndeclare in unison 'We thought we\nwere going to get the shit kicked out\nof us!' Of course, such panic is now\nonly a distant memory, and over\n$110 million and 8 Oscar\nnominations on, they can afford to\nlaugh about their previous\nnightmares. As Hoffman remembered, ' Who the hell\nexpected a blockbuster? Three\ndirectors walked out, and we kept\nsaying 'Well, we've got two guys,\n\u2022one is physically autistic, the other\nis spiritually autistic...!'.\nOn the question of Oscar\nnominations, I tried to provoke a response from Barry Levinson, but\nhe refused to deviate from the\nstandard, guardedly-modest line;\n'I'm so pleased I got nominated, but\nI can't feel myself getting\ncompetitive...you do not sit and\nthink while you're making the film\n'Gee, I'm going to win some\nawards!'. Hoffman was rather more\noriginal in his response; obviously\nannoyed that Tom Cruise was not\non the Academy short list, he put\nthis down to his good looks!\u2014'Tom\nshould have been nominated; he\nknows why he wasn't,I know why\nhe wasn't... If he had had this nose\n(indicating his own rather\nprominent proboscis) he would\nhave been nominated!'.\nHowever many golden statuettes\nRain Man collects on March 29 (and\nI would guess that it will pick up a handful at least), the future looks\ndistinctly bright for Messrs.\nLevinson, Cruise and Hoffman.\nAfter Tin Men and Diner, Rain Man\nshould have the effect of finally\nestablishing Barry Levinson as one\nof the top filmmakers in Hollywood\ntoday, whilst also serving as proof\nthat yes, Tom Cruise can actually\nact. As for Dustin Hoffman, whose\nstatus as a silver screen legend is\nalready assured, he is looking\nforward to his forthcoming West\nEnd appearance as Shylock (hence\nthe blossoming bristles). I asked him\nabout the comparisons between the\ntwo mediums of stage and screen;\nhe said that he relished performing\nin front of a live audience, while at\nthe same time he preferred the\npermanence of the cinema as\nopposed to the immediacy of the\ntheatre\u2014he concludes, however,\nthat overall 'It's just nice to work!'\nSo much is true, but then again if\nyou are Dustin Hoffman (or Barry\nLevinson or Tom Cruise for that\nmatter), it's also nice to know you\ndon't have to.\nBill Dale.\nPage 34 FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Football\nThe doubles tournament has been\nwon, in a gruelling and hard fought\nfinal, by Saif Ghouse (Chem Eng 2)\nand Clive Roberts (Physics PG).\nTheir opponents took a25 point\nlead in the first frame but a timely\nbreak defeated them on the pink\nball.\nThe next two frames were lost\nconvincingly by the eventual\nwinners, with the balls being badly\nplaced for break-building.\nAfter composing themselves, SG and CR came back determined to\nwin their \u00a324 (wow!) prize money.\nThev played no frills, sensible\nsnooker and kept their noses in\nfront. In the end, both frames were\nwon comfortably.\nSailing Club\nLast weekend IC Sailing Club sent\na team to one of the premier\nUniversity team racing events of the\nyear: The Bradford Barrel. After a warm reception in Bardford on\nFridaV night, the teams arrived to\nstart racing on Saturday at a time\nconsidered by most teams to be far\ntoo early.\nThe IC team sailed consistently\nthroughout the weekend. Highlights included a win over the\nstrong horn team Bradford, a confrontation with Edinburgh when\nwe came out with big guns blazing\nand a victory over the University of\nLondon team in one of the most\nexciting races of the series. We did,\nhowever, narrowly lose to the\neventual winners, Southampton,\nwhose team included two Olympic\ntrialist s. After the prize giving and celebrations, including the sharing\nout of the prize (the 'Bradford\nBarrel') and a dip in the lake for\nseveral people, the team set off for\nhome after a very enjoyable\nweekend.\nBoat Club\nLadies Head of the River\nOn Saturday March 3, the Imperial\nCollege ladies eight competed in the\nWomen's Head of the River. Almost\n200 crews were timed as they raced\nthe 4\nV2 miles from Chiswick to\nPutney Pier (the Oxford-Cambridge\nboat race course in reverse). In a closely fought competition, the\nladies came tenth out of 47 crews in\ntheir category.\nKingston Head of the River\nImperial crews from all squads\nentered the Kingston Head race last\nSaturday, the punishing course\nstretches along the Thames from\nHampton Court to Teddington\nLock.\nThe men's first eight, despite\nbeing given a start position low\ndown in the running order, put in\nan impressive performance, coming\nsecond overall in the event.\nTwo days before the race, the\nsecond eight's boat, known affectionately as the 'Eric Bash', had\nundergone drastic remodelling with\nthe help of some iron railings and\na freak gust of wind. Bandaged up,\nhe carried the crew to second place\nin their category. A trail of steam\nwas left hanging over the course as\nthe novice men's eight raced to\nvictory in their category. The\nphenomenon was later put down to\nthe animated conversation between\nnumbers five and six, rather than\nthe speed of the boat.\nThe ladies eight finished third in\ntheir category.\nUniversity of London Head\nLast Sunday, boat crews from all the\nLondon colleges competed in their\nown head race; from Hammersmith\nBridge to the UL clubhouse near\nKew.\nThe men's first eight did not race\nafter their ex ers ions of the previous\nday. However, their stroke man and\nclub captain, Steve Pearson, defying\nthose who thought the stroke seat\nwas the most powerful position that\nhe could occupy, turned his hand to\nco xing the 2nd eight, they did not\ndisappoint, coming first overall. The\nmen's novice eight came in close\nbehind in third place overall,\nwinning their category by over two\nminutes. This takes their total to ten\nconsecutive wins this year. The\nladies had an unlucky race and only\nmanaged fourth place in their\ncategory.\nIC l sts \u20143\nUC0 Skipper Nigel Collier was once\nagain the hero of the day, bagging\nhis second hat-trick in consecutive\ngames, as IC swept aside a spirited\nUC side to clinch their first ever\nUniversity of London Division title.\nPlaying into the fierce wind and\ndriving rain in the first half IC found\nit hard to establish themselves and\nit was UC who made the early\nrunning, playing the ball about with\nsome confidence and forcing several\nbrave saves from S Holden. However, Franz and the boys at the\nback held firm and IC began to grow\nin confidence. Inspired in midfield\nby the return of Si Cole and by the\nblistering pace of Mick Plummer\ndown the right flank (aided, to his\nown surprise, by Ivan Parkin), IC\nbegan to impose themselves and\ntook the lead on the half hour when\nNigel slid the ball home from a narrow angle.

Soon after\nWendal Charles scored with an\nexcellent 30 yard shot, and by halftime IC were 4-1 up.\nIn the second half IC tore\nGoldsmiths apart with some\ndevastating midfield play from\nChrist Hargreaves, Toni De Leon\nand Neil Bond who scored with a brilliant solo run through the\ndefence.\nAlthough hard pressed\nGoldsmiths occasionally managed\nto penetrate the IC half, but were\neasily contained by IC defenders\nIvan Parkin, Sean Cary and Paul\nNeville.

Despite effectively losing the\nservices of Phil Evans after a headbutt from Pip Peel, Guy Hattersley\ncovered superbly at the back and\nindeed IC nearly added a fourth\nwhen Byron Wood's late effort was\nruled offside.\nThis win over the third placed\nteam leaves IC three points clear\nwith one game remaining and thus\nguarantees them the\nChampionship.\nMore Football\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 31\n\n"

    "content": "Easter\nFor Christians, the Easter stories are\nthe stories of how Jesus Christ rose\nfrom the dead and showed himself\nto his followers. But the word\n'Easter' comes from the name of a germanic pagan goddess Eostre or\nEastre. Her name means 'the dawn'\nand her festival, that took place\nevery spring, was about light and\nwaking up to new life.\nIt was probably Saint Bede ( AD673735) from Jarrow in the northeast of England who first joined the\ntwo festivals together. It was one\nway of converting the pagans to\nChristianity. This was the beginning\nof Easter as we know it.\nThe Easter Egg\n\\ ow a days chocolate eggs are\nprobably favorites for Easter, but\nthis is a relatively recent addition.\nFor thousands of years people have\ngiven hard-boiled or 'blown' eggs to\none another as gifts in spring.\nEspecially in Eastern European\ncountries, a lot of time and care goes\ninto decorating these gifts. They can\nlast for many generations, some\nbecoming family heirlooms.\nFor Christians they quickly came\nto have a special meaning. They are\na sign of new life which is just about\nto break out. On Easter morning the\nrolling away of the stone was like\nthe breaking of an egg.\nIn the Middle Ages it was the\ncustom not to eat eggs during Lent.\nThe custom of boiled eggs for\nbreakfast on Easter morning still\ngoes on. For a long time it was\nliterally a breaking of the fast.\nThe Easter Bunny\nIn many countries the Easter Bunny\nis said to bring the Easter eggs.\nThese are hidden in various\nlocations in the home and children\ngo on an 'Easter Egg Hunt'. This\nmight be the most enjoyable Easter\npast-time, however the use of\nyoung rabbits as a symbol for Easter\nis probably based on a mistake.\nTraditionally it was the hare, not the\nrabbit, which was associated with\nEaster.\nSome may have come across the\nEaster hare in the Hare Pie\nScramble. The story of this custom\nis about a lady who, many centuries\nago, was chased by a bull whilst\ncrossing a field. She was only saved\nfrom being gored to death when a hare ran across the path of the bull\ncausing it to hesitate. In gratitude\nthe woman gave some land to the\nchurch on condition that the rector\nof the parish should distribute two\nhare pies to the parishioners every\n\\ ear;\n\u2022 J Making hare pie seems a strange\nway of showing gratitude to hares,\nbut does not stray far from the\noriginal reason for their presence in\nEaster. The hare was almost\ncertainly used as the festival sacrifice\nto Eostre.\nThe Empty Tomb\nBy far the largest part of the Easter\nweek centres around an empty\ntomb. Why is such colossal\nimportance attached to this tomb?\nBecause the body of a man called\nJesus Christ was meant to be in it,\nand because this event causes\nChristianity to stand or fall.\nSo what is said to have taken place\non that first Easter Day? Jesus had\ndied, executed on a Roman cross\ntwo days before. He had been taken\ndown from the cross shortly before\nthe Jewish day of rest (the Sabbath)\nby Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, who had hurriedly\nplaced his body in a tomb.\nOnce the Sabbath was over, a group of women made their way\ndown to the tomb to complete the\nlast funeral rites. They found the\nstone sealing it rolled away and the\nbody gone. Not wanting their\nexpensive funeral spices to go to\nwaste they tried to find out where\nthe body was.\nJesus later appeared to two of his\nfriends as they were walking down\nthe Emmaus road. No one believed\nthem. Then Jesus appeared to all the\ndisciples apart from Thomas.\nThomas didn't believe them. (Here\nis the original 'doubting Thomas'.)\nThen Jesus appeared to Thomas.\nAmongst appa rations and resurrections most of us just get lost\nor consider it non-scientific\nnonsense, but many have spent\nmuch time and effort, trying to\nprove or disprove the Easter Tomb\nStory. In the end they almost all\ncome up with four main alternatives\nthat have to be considered. They are\nas follows:\n1) A Swoon by Jesus\nAfter being whipped, nailed to a cross, speared in the side, Jesus was\nregistered as dead by the Romans,\nalthough he only lapsed into\nunconsciousness. Then after three\ndays in the tomb, he got out of his\ngrave wrappings, pushed away the\nstone blocking the tomb entrance,\ngave the Roman guard the slip and\nsought out his depressed disciples\nto successfully persuade them he\nhad risen from the dead.\n2) A Fraud by Others\n(Well if the Pharisees had taken the\nbody, they would have doubtlessly\nproduced it at the claims made by\nthe disciples of the risen Christ. So\nmost consider if a fraud, then the\ndisciples did it.)\nAfter beating back the Roman\nguard, the disciples rolled away the\nstone, took Jesus' grave clothes off\nto leave them behind, and then\nwent and dumped the body\nsomewhere. Later they were to be\nseen beaming with joy and saying\nJesus Christ was alive.\n3) Hallucinations by Bereaved\nFollowers\nThe depression of Jesus' friends\ncaused them to start hallucinating.\nNone of them ever got to the right\ntomb, they just thought it was his\nin their mental confusion. Others\nthen had hallucinations of Jesus\nappearing to them. These were so\ni 'real' that even the un believing Thomas got caught up in them. And i then suddenly all their\nhallucinations stopped.\n|4) A Miracle by God The story is as told in the four\nGospel accounts, and God raised\nJesus from the dead.\nChuck Colson was an associate of\nformer US president Richard Nixon.\nHe was involved with Nixon in the\nWatergate scandal of the seventies,\nand along with other con spirit or s, he was sent to prison. After prison\nhe spoke about Christianity and the\ni forty years in which Christ's disciples never backed down on\ntheir witness to the resurrection.\nColson knew from Watergate, that\nthe truth has a way of slipping out.\n;'We couldn't hold our stories\n^together for three weeks under the\n.pressure.' he said,' I was around the\n\"most powerful men in the world,\n.but we couldn't hold the lie. If the\nresurrection wasn't true, those\ni disciples could never have held out.\nSomeone would have dug out the\ntape or something!' But why spend any time on Easter\ni bothering about an empty tomb?\n!Surely there are more interesting\n(things to do centred around Easter\n:?gg s and bunnies.\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Food\n^lt ta Bread and\nCircuses\nOnce again FELIX is proud to present exotic\nrecipes from our erotic culinary expert Yishu.\nBelow is a complete meal as an example of Arabic\ncookery. We cannot promise the same effects on\nyou as happened to Yishu (see dedication at the\nend of this article) or perhaps there is a secret\ningredient in Egyptian food.\nIt is always a joy to invite someone\nto demonstrate a few interesting\ndishes from their national culinary\ndiet or dishes which are their\nparticular favourites. I have\ncaptured the magic of a meal with\nArabic and especially Egyptian\nflavour in this article so that it may\ninspire you to arrange a meal like\nthis yourself.\nThe guest chef, Reem Bahgat, had\ndecided that she wanted to grace my\ntable with 'Fattet Makdous' (a fried\naubergine dish served on a bed of\ncrisp pitta bread pieces) and 'Foul'\n(pronounced fool; an Egyptian bean\ndish). A little coaxing soon\nconvinced her to use the green\npumpkin that I had brought to make\nher childhood favourite of 'kara-as sal' as a dessert.\nThe Fattet Mak dous is a Palestinian dish which makes good\nuse of contrast to give it character.\nThe soft aubergine flesh sits under\na layer of hot mince meat sauce but\nabove a layer of cool but nutty\nyogurt and above a bed of crunchy\npitta bread. A masterpiece\nproviding contrast of both\ntemperatures and textures. The Foul\nis a heavy bean dish that would be\nseen served on Sunday afternoons\nwhen one has nothing more to do\nthan have a siesta and digest the\nlunch. Unfortunately the foul did\nnot excite me after the beauty of the\nFattet Makdous. I have provided\nrecipes which are based on the\nobservations that I made in the\nkitchen while the food was being\ncooked, they were not provided by\nthe guest chef.\nThe three dishes below provide a good meal for six people:\nFattet Makdous\nIngredients:\n4-5 medium size aubergine s1 pint whole milk set yogurt\n8-10 cloves of garlic\n1 Ms tah in a( sesame seed paste)\nlib minced beef\n1 this tomato paste\n3 Ms pine nuts\n5 medium pitta bread segments\n2 medium size onions\nMethod:\n1. Crush 5 cloves of garlic and\ncombine with the yogurt and tah in a paste. Set aside.\n2. Cook the mince beef in the\nnormal way by frying the onions\nand then adding the beef and\ntomato paste. Add some stock,\nblack pepper, ground coriander, salt\nand cook to completion. The mince\nbeef should not be too dry when\ncooked.\n3. Fry the pine nuts until lightly\nbrowned. Set aside.\n4. Place the 5 leaves of pitta bread\nin the oven at gas mark 5. Heat them\nuntil they are dry and crisp enough\nto be cracked into pieces. Set aside.\n5. Stir a half tablespoon of tomato\npuree into half a cup of water. Heat\na little bit of oil and the tomato\npreparation. Cook for a few\nminutes. Set aside.\n6.

    "content": "Focus on women\nMargaret Cunningham-running ICWISE\nMargaret Cunningham is the organiser of the Imperial College Women\ninto Science and Engineering (ICWISE) courses which aim to allow sixth\nform girls to find out about studying science and engineering, and also\nto find out more about Imperial College itself. She is currently the Senior\nTutor in the Department of Computing, has previously been College\nSenior Tutor for Women and has successfully combined both a career and\na family. She studied at IC both an undergraduate and as a postgraduate\nand after spending some time in industry returned to IC as a lecturer.\nHow many women were at IC when\nyou arrived?\nThere were just over 100 full time\nundergraduates. Everyone was very\nexcited about that. There were about\n40 fresher females.\nWere you yourself encouraged into\nScience?\nI was neither encouraged nor\ndiscouraged. I was just allowed to\nfollow my own mind.\nWhere did the idea for the ICWISE\ncourses come from?\nThey were an idea dreamed up by\nthe Rector's Working Party on the\nRecruitment of Women Students,\nwhich discusses a lot of general\nissues but has mostly concentrated\non running these courses.\nThey were inspired by the Insight\ninto Engineering courses which we\nran here every year they were held\nexcept the first. In 86 we ran both\nInsight and ICWISE, and we've run\nICWISE for 87 and 88 as well. I 've\ndone the planning for this year and\nthe preliminary booking for next\nyear. The course may or may not\nhappen after that, and I will\nprobably step down as organiser\nanyway.\nThe 'thing about the ICWISE\ncourses are that they're shorter than\nInsight. We've aimed to opt i mise the length of the course with the\nnumber of women on each course,\nas it is all additional work above\ntheir ordinary duties for the\nlecturers who take part. The courses\nlast two days and there are 45 to 50\nwomen on each course. We ran four\ncourses in the first year, eight in the\nsecond year and four residential and\none non-residential course last year.\nThat gave the opportunity for more\ngirls to be involved as we didn't have to accommodate them and a lot\nof them were women who either\nwouldn't want to live in hall or\nwould be mature students. This\nyear all the courses are residential.\nThe courses, including the\naccommodation are free, to\nencourage as many women along as\npossible.\nDuring the course there are talks\nand discussion on careers in Science\nand Engineering, Laboratory\nSessions in the Departments and\ntours of College and London, as\nwell as the chance to talk to students\nand members of staff.\nHow many subsequently study for\nscience-based degrees?\nI think that the number who come\nto IC each year is several dozen. It's. certainly not all of them, as I think\nthe courses have a far wider appeal\nand are more general than simply\nrecruiting into science. I do think it\nhas been instrumental in recruiting\nto IC, though. We've seen the\nbiggest single increase, 10%, in the\nnumber of women students at IC\nthis year. I think the course helps in\nas much as many girls are reassured\nabout what this part of London is\nlike. There's a small proportion who\nare put off simply because they\ndon't like London.\nDo you think it is a good idea to\nencourage women to come to IC?\nI think it is, partly for the parochial\nreason that it makes it nicer for the\ngirls who are already here, but also\nin the long term because industry\nneeds more qualified people.\nI think that girls are still\nsometimes put down when they get\ninterested in science and the\nreassurance of an all girl course\nhelps - they're meeting girls with\nthe same interests, possibly for the\nfirst time.\nWhat do you see as the problems\nfor women entering on science\nbased courses and science based\ncareers?\nIf you ask the careers people, I think\nthey'll tell you they're the same for\nwomen entering any career in which\nthey are outnumbered, for example\nthe City.\nI think individual prejudice is\nprobably still a problem, but\ncertainly the corporate view of\nwomen is improving, simply\nbecause of the need to employ\nwomen because of the labour\nshortage. Companies are realising\nthat they need to provide things like\nday nurseries in order to keep their\nfemale staff. There still seems to be\na lot of prejudice about bringing the\ntwo halves of women's lives, career\nand motherhood, together.\nWhat do you think are the attitudes\nof IC towards its women students?\nI think there are lots of different\nattitudes. There is still the big social\ndisincentive of the 'beer y, tribal\nsocial life'. The line from College,\nfrom the Senior Tutors and Admissions Tutors, is that they are\nvery keen that women here should\nfulfil their potential and they\ndefinitely want more women students.\nWhat is more disturbing is the lack\nof female staff. There is still a greater\ndrop-out rate among women than\nmen because a career break can be\ncritical for women. There are only\nabout 35 to 40 women staff herr\nThere are quite a lot of contract\nresearch staff but they don't have\nsecurity of tenure.\nHow do you think attitudes\ntowards women at IC have changed\nwhilst you've been at IC?\nI think there has been a realisation\nthat we need more female staff. I don't think this was even\nconsidered when I first came here.\nI think it's sad that when the\nImperial College Women's Association went it wasn't really\nreplaced, as it filled a need for social\ncontact. Women students have\nalways held more visible positions\nproportionately than men. That's probably because they're more\nmotivated and more individual than\nthe men who come here. They've\nhad to answer the question ' Why are you doing engineering when\nyou're a girl?'\nFrom whom have you received\nmost support in your work?\nBecause of this scheme there has\nbeen collaboration between all the\ndepartments for the first time. Each\ndepartment has had one member of\nstaff who has co-ordinated that\ndepartment's action, so I'm grateful\nto them and also to the Research\nAssistants who've helped with the\npractical work. We have female staff\nstaying during the courses and as\nthere aren't many of them that\nmeans there's been very good\nsupport from them.\nTerry Whodcoat, the Assistant\nAdmissions Registrar, has helped\nwith the administration, particularly\nwhile the courses have been\nrunning, and there have been\nseveral students who have acted as\nreceptionists and helped with the\nday-to-day running of the courses.\nThere are also all the staff and\nstuden st who've helped by coming\nalong to meals and talking to the\nwomen on the course.\nDo you class yourself as a 'feminist'?\nYes, I do, recognising that that\ncovers quite a wide range of views.\nI believe in equal rights and equal\nopportunities, but the word has\nconnotations and overtones put on\nit by its critics and it can imply\nextremism without pragmatism.\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 21\n\n"

    "content": "Focus on women\nFELIX interviews three women who deal with issues directly concerning women at IC\nGill Knowles-ICU Women's Officer\nGill Knowles is a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student and has\nbeen ICU Women's Officer this year.\nWhat do you see as the central\naspects of your job?\nI sit on Council and represent\nwomen's points of view. This\nbasically means ensuring that\nnothing sexist or derogatory to\nwomen is made into Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) policy. Also\nI'm responsible for providing such\nthings as rape alarms and transport,\nhome for women after Union\nevents. In addition I'm here if\nanyone has any problems and fee?s that they can't approach a member\nof staff or Sandra Dawson (the\nCollege Senior Tutor for Women).\nMy job is essentially to do\nwhatever the women at IC want me\nto do, which unfortunately doesn't seem to be very much. I have tried\nholding 'surgeries' and would be\nhappy to hold one once a week, but\nI don't get much response.\nWhat were your aims for the year\nwhen you took up the job?\nI actually took up the job at the last\nminute because nobody else had\nstood and I felt it was important that\nsomeone did the job.\nWhat do you feel you have achieved\nso far?\nThe organisation of transport and\nrape alarms has been going well.\nI 've also had some success in\nensuring that reports to Council are\nnot worded in a sexist manner,\nbecause I believe language can\nunderline sexual stereotyping.\nWhat other things would you like\nto see happening?\n\u2022 I 've been trying to organise self-defence classes but again I 've not\nhad enough response to make it\npossible to run a course.\nWhat do you see as the main\nproblems facing women at IC?\nFirstly let me state that my remarks\nare generalisations: they certainly\ndon't apply to everyone and\neverything. I feel that the attitude of\nCollege and the Union is very 'male-dominated' and that the C CU activities are 'male-orientated': the\n'ten pints of beer in the Union bar'\nsort of social event.\nCollege as a whole, but women in\nparticular suffer from the lack of an\nArts faculty, which is why the\nmerger with RH B NC might have\nbeen a good thing, although I don't believe it was good from the point\nof logistics. I 've also heard\ncomments like ' Oh, they won't fail\nyou because you're a girl', although\nI don't think that attitude is so\nprevalent any more.\nI think women have difficulty\nfinding other women who think the\nsame way, as there are not so many\nwomen to choose from, and so they\ndon't get the support they need.\nThe basic problem is 'the ratio' and\nwhat it does to the social life.\nA lot of women are obviously\nhappy, since they haven't come to\nsee me.\nDo you think men at IC have\nsimilar problems?\nI think that because of the ratio,\nsome men do. IC has a reputation\nfor high flyers which attracts people\nwho work all the time, and it does\nnothing for the social life. Women\nare put off at school because they\nsee IC as either hard work or hard\ndrinking. When men graduate they\ncan have difficulty relating to\nwomen because they've hardly\ndealt with them for three years.\nDo you think ICU needs a 'Men's Officer' to cope with these\nproblems?\nNo, I don't think it does. Men already have support because there\nare so many of them, so at least they\ndon't need help in finding each\nother.\nWhat do you feel the attitudes of\nthe Union as a policy making body\nand administrative structure are\ntowards women and their\nproblems?\nI think they're pretty good. I 've had\na lot of support and help over things\nlike organising transport home and\nrape alarms, particularly from Nigel\nBaker, Ian Morris and Jen HardyS mi th. Nigel was also very\nsupportive when I suggested that\nthere should be at least one female\nsub warden in each hall of residence\nwhen the future of sub wardens was\nbeing discussed.\nI do feel very wary of bringing up\n'women's' motions at Council\nbecause I have the impression that\nGill Knowles, ICU Women's Officer\nCouncil would regard them as\ntrivial.\nI feel that the CC U's do have a bad attitude, that they are Tittle boys\nplaying at games', but as I haven't been to any C CU events since my\nfirst year, I don't really know what\ntheir attitude is. I also don't approve\nof tie clubs, but as they're not really\nunder Union control and as block\nvotes have prevented their abolition\nin the past, I don't feel there is a lot\nI can do.\nWhat do you feel the attitudes of\nCollege towards its women\nstudents are?\nI think that College are aware that\nwomen students can have special\nproblems and that they are trying to\nattract more women under-graduates. They have a College\nSenior Tutor for Women and there\nis a Women's Tutor in Mech Eng.\nThey are certainly aware of the\nthings they could and should be\ndoing. I think there is still a latent\nsexism because College is male\ndominated and things change\nslowly.\nI don't feel there is any reverse\nsexism i.e. positive disc r imation, although perhaps when they have\na number of candidates who are\nequally able they will take a higher\nproportion of women. I think that\ncan only be good.\nFrom which people or organisations\nhave you received most support?\nI have had a lot of support from\nSandra Dawson, Linzi Wishart (last\nyear's Women's Officer), Jen HardySmith and Kathy Tait in the Union\nOffice, Nigel Baker, who has had a very thoughtful and positive\nattitude and Dave, the ICU Transport Officer, who has helped\nenormously with the transport after\nevents.\nDo you class yourself as a 'feminist'?\nDo you mean in the dictionary sense\nor in the 'popular' sense? Actually,\nI'd say probably both. It really\nirritates me when people say they're\nnot a feminist. The definition is,\nafter all, 'one who believes that men\nand women are equal' and\neverybody should believe that.\nPage 18 FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

The\naction was not only a notable\nsuccess in the area of external affairs\nbut was supported by the College's Governing Body, the Rector and\nmost Heads of Departments, who\nrescheduled lectures for the\nafternoon. A lobby of the DES,\nsome weeks later, saw the three\nUnion Office sabbaticals holding a seven hour vigil, and leafleting\neminent members of the education\nhierarchy including Mr Kenneth\nBaker MP. Three Union Office\nsabbaticals held a seven-hour vigil\nWith tedious repetition we have\nread about the NUS march in\nNovember, the 'non-organised'\nmarch on February 1st: a notable\nsuccess despite the withdrawal of\nthe National Union of Students\n(NUS), the University of London\nUnion (ULU) and our own Union,\nthe educational shutdown on March\n16th and finally the two-mile long\nNUS demonstration which included\na large contingent from the\nAssociation of University Teachers\n(AUT).\nThe AUT themselves have\nstimulated the pens on the FELIX\nnews desk on numerous occasions\nthis term. Exam disruption was\nthreatened in the first issue of the\nyear, followed by threats of not\nmarking work and not grading\nmarked work. The Rector said little\non the matter to FELIX but\nexpressed his disapproval of the\naction in a letter to The Times. The\nUnion investigated the possibility of\nstudents sue ing the AUT, and barristers felt there was a worthwhile case on the students'\npart.\nFrom external politics to internal\npolitics and the biggest 'stir' of the\nterm came in the form of a seemingly innocent motion at\nCouncil which suggested the\nabolition of Union General Meetings\n(UGMs), thus leaving Council the\ntop decision-making body in the\nUnion. Council voted to take the\nmotion to aUG M and all hell was\nlet loose. The aim of the plan was\nto produce a body of people with a Council voted to take\nthe motion to a UGM\nand all hell broke\nloose\nfair representation from St Mary's, who claimed they were unable to\nattend IC UG Ms. The U GM which\nensued saw the highest attendance\nof the year, and the 'abolition'\nmotion was crushed by 150 votes.\nAs soon as one drama is over,\nanother one begins. After months of\nspeculation and rumours, the\nsabbatical candidates finally\nrevealed themselves, and the\nelection battle began. With twelve\ncandidates standing for the four\nposts, the battle proved to be a tough one. St Mary's votes were\ndisqualified on the grounds that\ntheir Executive had 'deliberately\nbiased the elections'. After IC votes\nwere counted it became evident that\nthe St Mary's vote would not have\nbeen capable of changing the\nelection results, and members of the\nUnion expressed fears that the\ndecision would have a detrimental\neffect on the already fraught\ndiscussions between the two Unions. In one term St Mary's had\nlost their fight to abolish UG Ms and\ntheir voting rights. Discussions on\na merger between the two Unions\nwere dropped.\nThe internal relationship between\nFELIX and Union President Nigel\nThe appointment of a new Welfare Adviser\nhas been unanimously\napplauded\nBaker remained equally fraught.\nAfter several heated arguments an\nagreement was reached, which was\npassed at aUG M. Next term the\nFELIX Editor and the President are\nto 'swap' jobs for a week, in an\nattempt to enable each to\nunderstand better the pressures of\nthe other's job.\nThe Union have received credit for\na number of achievements this term.\nThe appointment of a new Welfare\nAdviser has been unanimously\napplauded. The Union Building has\nreceived a large upgrade in security,\nwith the installation of a new lock\nsystem, and the opening of a new\nsecurity lodge at the door of the\nbuilding. The issue of the new keys\nwas so limited that the FELIX Editor\nhad to fight hard to receive a key to\nthe FELIX Office.\nThe term's most unproductive\nupset involved heated talks and\nendless reams of writing about the\npossible merger of Imperial College,\nwhich has recently merged with St\nMarys, and Royal Holloway and\nBedford New College, which itself\nhas just merged. A working party\nset up to discuss the advantages a merged institute would enjoy\ndecided in favour of the plans, but,\nin the light of the difficult financial\nsituation of the two colleges which\nface a joint deficit of \u00a36.5M by 1992,\nthe entire discussions merged into\nBristol University had\nits main administration block bombed\nby animal liberation\nactivists\nnothing when a meeting of Heads\nof Departments rejected the plans.\nExternal forces have provided\nmore dramatic upsets in the latter\nhalf of term. Bristol University had\nits main administration block\nbombed by Animal Liberation\nActivists, and shortly afterwards\nsecurity at IC reported that they had\nreceived a number of 'suspect'\nphone calls. Biochemistry rapidly\nincreased their security but Applied\nBiology felt there was no need.\nThe threat of bombs was overshadowed when FELIX reported an outbreak of\nLegionnaires Disease in College.\nCollege Secretary, John Smith, who\nFELIX reported on an\noutbreak of Legionnaires Disease\nis rumoured to be leaving at the end\nof the year, wrote to all students\ninforming them of the dangers and\nsymptoms, and ventilation cooling\ntowers were closed down throughout College and the Science\nMuseum as possible sources of\ninfection.\nThe Union has witnessed more\nfinancial upset, this time from the\nCollege bookshop which is \u00a316,000\nin debt, with little explanation for\nthe lost money. The College has lost\nvast quantities of money in the form\nof computer thefts, though whether\nthis is now news is dubious.

And Ian, the super\nchap, had so much Moet he could barely\nremember the name of his girlfriend , let alone\nthe design on his y fronts. Most embarrassing for\nthe poor darling but he did have a splendid time.\nAnyway, this little fling is to celebrate Jeremy's new baby\u2014a biscuit-beige Rolls Royce\nCorniche\u2014not my taste but there we are Jeremy's still the 'nouveau-rich e'c liche really\u2014\nnot quite there yet. He's booked some jazz pianist\nfor the evening\u2014couldn't afford the Chas chap\nI really wanted. Most disappointing.\nMust pop off now. The food hall's shut soon.\nDo join us, Billy, we've made a special exception\nfor you\u2014it was only supposed to be open to\nsabbaticals you know, but since you were such\na jol lv wheeze at the last one I decided to make\nvo u my very own guest.\nSplendid kisses and fondest regards,\nFifi Trixibclle.\nElection\nsection\nDear Sir,\nI find it incredible that the Hon Sec (Events)\nshould think that at every ballot box each\ncandidate receives roughly the same proportion\nof votes. I wonder how many candidates and\nagents would have liked to have seen the odd\nballot box from the 'wrong' part of the\nconstituency suddenly spontaneously combust.\nSurely the votes from St Mary's are bound to vary\nthe most. Still, being a returning officer is fraught\nwith interesting surprises.\nYours,\nAndrew Robinson, Physics 2.\nMarch 22 1989 FELIX Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Music\nMcCarthyism This interview was conducted at the\nFulham Greyhound in late February\n1989, and first broadcast on IC Radio\non Monday March 13. I spoke to\nMalcolm (singer) and Tim (guitarist)\nfrom the band.\nHow do you see yourself these\ndays?\nMcC...I think we're trying to change\npop music in some way, trying to\nmake it a bit more relevant to\npeople's lives, trying to relate it to\nthe world and not cut it off like it is\nat the moment\u2014most pop music is\npure escapism and has no relevance\nlo anybody's life, so we feel we're\nquite a campaigning group now,\nwe're trying to say something a bit\nmore intelligent in a pop song.\nMost of your song titles have some\nkind of obvious\nmessage...presumably the lyrics are\ndeveloping these ideas?\nTim. Every record we've released\nhas had overtly political lvr ics, but\nwe think that everything is political\naround us\u2014we don't consider\nourselves similar to other 'political\nbands'. There's a policy running\nthroughout everything we do, and\nthe music is just a framework for\nwhat we have to say.\n(To Malcolm.) Are the whole band\nbehind your lyrics...it's not just you\n'crusading'?\nTim. It's Mai's specific ideas\u2014none\nof the rest of us contribute to them,\nbut we all agree to protest about\nwhat we don't like in the world and\nwhat needs to be changed. None of\nus is un political, though we have\ndifferences of opinion in solutions.\nWould you classify yourself as an\nindie band?\nMcC. Well we are on an\nindependent l able, but as a form of\nmusic...we don't think about being\nany particular category of\nmusic...we avoid overtly rock\nclich es and so on, and we have our\nown idiosyncratic brand of music,\nwhich can't easily be put in any\nother category, which leaves the\nhorrible 'indie' tag.\nI don't think we have any more\nin common with any group on an\nindie l able than we have with\nanyone on a major label.\nMai. Our influences are not\ngenerally musical influences\u2014\nthey're from art, or literature\nparticularly from the 1920s: Berthold\nBrecht, John Hartfield, George\nCross, people like that. We think\nthey have a similar way of going\nabout things to us. A much higher\nvision.\nSomeone was telling me that you're\nmaking a video next week\u2014is that\ntrue?\nMai. Dreadfully true, yes. It's not\nsomething that I find particularly\nnatural to do..We feel reasonably\nconfident about making records\nnow, but it was a long process of\nlearning.\nThe video is for our new record\n(Keep an Open Mind or Else). It\ninvolves a liberal, arguing with\nsomebody. At first he's very\ntolerant, saying yes, you're entitled\nto these opinions, but gradually as\nthe song goes on he's getting more\nand more wound up by what this\nother person's saying, so by the end\nhe's threatening him with violence.\nWe wanted to illustrate this in some\nway in the video. 1 though the most\nobvious way to signify tolerance was\nto give someone a kiss, so I'm afraid\nsomeone's going to have to kiss Tim\non the cheek in the first verse\u2014and\nin the third verse they're going to\nhave to spit at him, Tim's not\nlooking forward to being spat at.\nIt must be quite exciting\u2014do you\nthink you're about to launch off\ninto major things?\nMai. Into space? Probably into\nspace. Once people find out what\nwe're saying, perhaps they will\ncome to our houses and stone the\nwindows. I hope so! That would be\nthe ideal reaction.\nWell you'd certainly get an\nexclusive with the Sun then...You\nstill seem quite idealistic\u2014so you\nhaven't been embittered by the\n'pop world' yet.\nMcC. No,I dunno why that is. It's a very embittering thing, obviously\nall just for money. But we're very\nsure of what we want to do in the\ngroup, and what we want to see\nhappening in the world, so we've\ngot a lot of res ili ance. You're all Londoners\u2014have you\ntoured much outside London?\nTim. Oh yeah, In fact, we don't play\nmuch in London. We play round\nEurope quite a bit.\nWhere's your favourite place in\nEngland to play?\nMcC. Edinburgh's always good\nTim. Well I like London\u2014I have to\nhave a big city, I can't stand\nanything rural.\nMai. All the countryside should be\nbuilt over immediately and be made\nuseful\u2014I mean it's completely\nuseless just sitting there doing\nnothin in particular\u2014I think it's got\nfar too good a press up to now, in\nthe history of mankind! I think you've just lost a lot of\nGreen fans.\nMai. Good, good! Goodbye! Actually... you do Math's don't you?\nYes.\nMai. Because it occurred to me that\na lot of my songs are meant to be\nlike mathematical propositions...\n(?*@*)\nMai trying to get all the feeling\nand vague-mindedness out, they're\nmeant to be very cold, logical and\nprecise, very accurate. 1 say a proposition in the first verse, and\nsomeone will have to go along with\nthat, another in the second and so\non, and then 1 hit them with the\nconclusions, and they're usually\nhorrified by the conclusions, but\nbecause they've agreed with the\npropositions earlier, they're in\ntrouble.\nI can't fault that. 1 hope you don't lose the poetry though.\nMai. Well....I'm not that bothered\nabout poetry. Mathematical is what\nI want really...The music Tim writes\nis very emotional most of the time,\nand the lyrics are always playing off\nagainst the music in some way.\nYou have a new album coming out.\nMai. Yes. 'The Enraged Shall Inherit\nthe Earth', due out in March.\nOh. That'll be good!\nMai. It's from the Bible\u2014I'm always\nreading my Bible.\nSmashing\nMcCarthy s new album is out\nnow\u2014and the gig was dead good!\nLove from Susan xx.\nIC Radio have been scuttling about\ninterviewing pop groups these last\nfew weeks. Two Mondays ago saw\nthe broadcasting of a conversation\nwith McCarthy and also with Jesus\nJones, re cored at their recent gig at\nour very own gorgeous Imperial\nCollege. We have taped interviews\nwith Birdland and also the legendary\nGaye Bikers on Acid\u2014both to be\nbroadcast early next term\u2014and in\nthe pipeline are the Rose of Avalanche\nand Spaceman 3.\nFor further transmission times,\nwrite to Tom Cunnington or Susan\nAppleby, c/ or IC Radio, and keep an\neye out in the 'What'sOn' column.\nKeep listening\u2014999KHz Medium\nWave, 97.7FM test transmissions.\nWe're all having a mega-happy\ntime.\nBig Bov Tom at oULU Big Bov Tomato have dimples. Punk\npackaged in cute cladding. Fronted\nby a dizzy gal who peers\nendearingly through a frizzy fringe,\nt as s les, odd socks, oversized t shirt\nand baseball boots. She grins and\nadore-me dimples appear in her\ncheeks. Surely this is not the face of\npost punk nostalgic music. It is!\nAs with most modern fast pop\nperformers they shoot through a funn v set paying more attention to\nenergy than technical mastery. The\ndrummer (I'm convinced he was\none of the great train robbers) beats\nand bashes baldly. The 78rpm rendition of Summer Loving gets the\ncrowd smiling.\nThey certainly have the right idea.\nThe only way to revive punk is\ntongue-in-cheek. In this way> there\nis no prospect of artistically\n'spoiling' any piece because there is\nno p retention involved and no one\ntakes it seriously.\nThey were a guitarist short tonight\nbut it didn't matter, with or without\nthey were worth \u00a30 of anybody's money.

The\ncountry is small and rectangular-shaped. Squashed between the\nhulks of India and China it wisely\nadopts its foreign policies to\ncompromise between the two\ncountries.\nWhen I first arrived in Kathmandu\nI reeled with culture shock. The\nairport steps were covered with spit\nand the crowds of people who had\ncome to greet the plane filled the air\nwith violent and drawn-out\nhawking.\nKathmandu is not i cable for its\nwide ranging ethnic background;\nthere were the slightly Mongoloid\nNewars, the original inhabitants of\nthe Kathmandu Valley, the dark,\nCaucasian peoples from the-Ganges, and the strongly\nMongoloid Tibetans, but do not be\nsurprised to see roughly clad aging\nhippies walking the streets - the\nhangers on from the 1960's Tibetan\nday dreams.\nLurching about in the back of the\nLandrover feeling queasy from jet-lag, I discovered that the roads were\nprimitive and that most drivers had\nnot heard of a traffic code. Cyclists\nand sacred cows were everywhere\nand whenever a cow felt the urge to\ncross a road, all traffic stopped.\nThe streets of Khatmandu were\nfilthy, narrow, splattered with spit,\nanimal and human excrement and\nrotting garbage; they were always\npacked with people.\nHere pagoda-shaped temples,\nwith the ever-present pair of blue\neyes painted on their golden towers,\na Nepali-type number one painted\nunder them to remind the people of\ntheir faith, shocked me with their\nerotic wooden carvings on the roof\nsupports. I learnt more from them\nthan I ever did in school.\nThe pre domine nt religion of the,\npeople is Hindu; the other main\nreligion being Buddhism. Some of\nus could learn something from the\nway people of such divergent value\nsystems live in harmony; there are\nspecific Hindu and Buddhist temples in Nepal but most temples\ncontain images or statues sacred to\nboth religions.\nThe architecture retains much of\nthe old Newar influence with small\nSitting astride an elephant is as\nuncomfortable as it looks, I discovered the next day as we went\ntiger-spotting in the jungle.\nUnfortunately, elephants being\nlarge, they tend to crash through the\ndense undergrowth, and all we did\nsucceed in sporting was a rhinoceros\nwith her baby.\nIn Pokhara (about 200km west of\nKathmandu), we had just about\nenough time for a row on the largest\nlake in Nepal and a cup of tea at the\nHotel New Crystal, with a magnificent view of the Annapurna\nrange of mountains behind it, before\nwe hit the runs again. This time we\ncould identify the culprit. At an\nhotel, shortly after ordering our\ndinner, there was a power cut. The\nresultant dim lighting meant that we\nfailed to notice that the food was\nhalf cooked.\nMany people travel to Pokhara to\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n/;..,^ ... ; .............. '\nAn example of Wendy's driving\nA river\nshops on the street level, living\nquarters on the upper overhanging\nfloors\u2014not unlike the Rows at\nChester\u2014with highly skilled wood\ncarvings surrounding the narrow\ndoors and windows.\nAfter a miserable Christmas when\nwe all spent the day in bed,\nshouting encouragement or voicing\ndespair to each other as we took it\nin turns to crawl to the loo (I have\nnever heard of a visitor to Nepal not\ngetting the runs) we set off for the\nChitwan National Park. This is\nabout 110km south-west of\nKathmandu.\nThe steep terraced hillsides\noutside Kathmandu are a joy to\nbehold, but rounding sudden bends\nto be confronted by a fast moving\nbus can be un-nerving.\ntrek up to the Himalayas, to\nJomosam or the Annapurna Sanctuary. Along most paths are\nchau tana( stone benches in a square\naround api pul tree) to rest at, and\ntea houses selling, if you're lucky\ntea from a pot boiling away with\nmilk and excessive quantities of\nsugar for about 2p. You can stay at\ntea houses for about lOp; a twin\nfoam mattress, blanket and wooden\nshelf all inclusive.\nI did return to Nepal, and no\ndoubt I will again, for despite Nepal\nbeing one of the least developed\nnations of the world, it has a lot to\noffer. Although people are intensely\ncurious, they are generally friendly\nto the same degree and the old\nOriental mysticism pervades the\natmosphere everywhere.\nPage 8 FELIX March 22 1989\n\n"

The AUT now\nintends to ballot its members on the\npav offer and the result wil be\nreleased in mid April. ViceChancellors have insisted that there\nis no more money available for a higher offer.\nThreats of legal action by parents\nand students whose examinations\nmay be disrupted by the dispute\nhave spurred Vice Chancellors\nthroughout the country to consider\nany action they may take against the\nAUT. One Vice Chancellor pointed\nout that if Universities did not take\naction against staff boycotting\nex ani nations, they would have little\ndefence in court against any student\nsuing them. Vice Chancellors have\npreviously considered lock-outs,\nsuspension of pay and dismissals for\nstaff taking part in the action.\nRHBNC\nmakes new\nplans\nRoval Hollowav and Bedford New\nCollege (RHBNC) has published a report outlining its plans for\nacademic development's in the\n1990's. The report assumes that\nRH B NC will \"stand alone\" within\nthe University of London and not\nmerge with IC and that any increase\nin resources will be generated by\nRH B NC itself.\nCourses at RH B NC will be\nchanged to reflect the more diverse\nqualifications brought about by the\nnew A/S level examinations. This\nwill entail more joint and multidisciplinary courses which\nmay involve increased co-operation\nwith IC in the areas of Science and\nEngineering. Greater European\nintegration by both colleges will be\nfurther stimulus for combinations\ninvolving European languages,\nespecially with science subjects. ,\nMascotry Madness\nmm\nCity and Guilds Union have\nkidnapped the seven foot high bear\n'Roger Davies' from Royal\nHolloway and Bedford New College. The bear, which is the\nmascot of the RH B NC students\nUnion was kidnapped on Saturday\nafternoon by a team of mascot e ers 'acting on inside information.'\nA spokesman from City and\nGuilds Union told FELIX that the\nmascot e ershad broken into a cupboard at the top of RH B NC' s North Tower to retrieve the mascot,\nwhich was chained to the wall with\na15ft chain. The Mascoteers\nremoved the chain and carried the\nbear away unchallenged.\nRH B NC Union are reported to be\nvery keen to regain po session of\n' Roger'. RCS get big brass lamp\n1 Students from the Royal School of\nMines attempted to batter down the\ndoor to the Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) Office on Friday\nnight after the R CSU mascot ry team\nsucceeded in stealing the Royal\nSchool of Mines (RSM) mascot,\nDavy.\nThe three feet high outsize Davy\nlamp was stolen from a room in the\nRoyal School of Mines on Tuesday\n14 March after what RCS Vice\nPresident, Dave Williams described\nas several months of\nrecon na:.s ance. Mr Williams told FELIX that the\nRS M Union General Meeting at\nwhich RCS students had previously\nbeen caught with forged Union\ncards had been part of the planning.\nHe added that RS M will now have\nto raise \u00a31000 before they recover\ntheir mascot.\n'There has been a much better\nspirit within the RCS than there has\nbeen for a few years. Who knows\nwhat the future holds? ' he said.\nFire!\nSouth Kensington underground\nstation was evacuated last Tuesday\n(14th), when a small fire was\ndiscovered on the escalator\nconnecting the.Picadilly and District\nlines. The fire was extinguished by\nstation staff as trains passed through\nthe station without stopping for\ntwenty minutes.\nComputheft\nThe College's spate of computer\nthefts has continued with the theft\nof four computers from the\nAeronautics department last week.\nThe the ives 'had all the keys and an\nintimate local knowledge,' said\nChief Security Officer, Geoff\nReeves.
