A soccer player with a dislocated knee had to\nbe ousted from his str it cher so lh at an injured player\ncould be accommodated In all, five people went to hospital with concussion; a broken rib; ft cracked wrist; the\ndislocated knee, and a broken collar bone- One trusts that\nthis is not to bq the weekly average!\nThe R.C. C. minibus can now be booked hy all I.C. \u2022clubs; booking terra s are available in the Union Office.\nBADMINTON\nImperial College has one of the strongest badminton\nclubs in the London University League, and accordingly\nhas bad many successful seasons in the past. The club runs\n5 teams\u20143 mens, 1 mixed and 1 ladies. Matches against\nother London Colleges are played on Wednesday afternoons and Saturdays; Liendlies are also arranged with\nOftbrd, Cambridge and Brighton.\nIC AFC Trials\nThe club plays at nine\nElms Baths, Battersea,\nwhere two courts are hired\nregularly. Play also takes\nplace in the Union Gymnasium on Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and\nSunday mornings. This\nyear's trials will be starting\nthis week and any players\nwho are interested in playing are asked to contact the\nCaptain Or Secretary c/o the\n'Union rack.\nTowards the end of the\nseason a singles championship is held and the winner\nhas his name suitably inscribed on a tankard in the\nUnion Bar! Prospects for\nthe club this season seem\nvery good as a large number of fresher s have shown\ninterest; their support is\nmost important to the continued success of the club.\nWOMEN ONLY Imperial College Women'*\nSports Club, known as\nICW(I) SC fun s athletics\nbadminton, hockey, netball,\nsquash, swimming, table\ntennis and tennis teams. Although all the captains have\nnot yet had their trials we\nseem to be heading for another promising year.\nThe netball team is in the\nUniversity of London Union\n1st league and with a little\nmore support may avoid relegation this season. The\nhockey team has much to\nlive up to having won the\nU.L. U. Gifford Cup and the\nU.L. U. American to urna ment. We also joined with\nthe men's club, to win the\nmixed hockey tournament.\nMixed hockey; a very social\ngame, is played on Sundays\nand people wishing to play\nshould sign the notice placed\nconveniently near the Union\nBar.\nThis year with the new\npool we hope to get a swimming team off the ground\nand despite the squash\ncourts not yet being ready\nwe hope the team will again\nhave a measure of success\nas the only ladies team in\nthe league.\nI.C.

The\ninflux of fresher enthusiasm\nhas encouraged even some\nof the \" old lags\" to train,\noften at ungodly hours and\nplaces.\nThe 1s tU.L. Trial was\nour initial competition and\nwe fared well. Many of us\nwere delighted to see (etc.)\nthe Hampstead mud in excellent condition so early\non in the season.\nOn the following day\n(Sunday) we trained at Border A.C. near Haslemere,\nSurrey, under the expert\nguidance of Bill Sykes, who\nallowed some of us to discover that orienteering is a subject I.C. doesn't ade-qu at ely cater for. The session\nclosed with a shattering re-lay. Plans regarding orienteering are germinating in\nfertile minds.\nBy publication, we will\nhave run in the U.

Team !\nIf you are interested in\ntraining with us, come to\nthe Gym at 12.30 on Tuesdays or Thursdays.\nBOB JENSEN.\n1st. XV FALTER\n, The Eton Fives Club is\none of the newest of the\nI.C. athletic clubs, and is in\nfact the only E.F. club in\nLondon University. The\nclub has a useful nucleus\nof keen players and with a few fresher s the team could\nimprove considerably. We\nare hoping that the coming\nyear will prove our most\nsuccessful yet. The club\nplays about a dozen\nmatches spread out Over\nthe first two terms. We\npractise most Friday evenings usually at Westminster\nSchool courts. In addition\nother evenings can probably\nbe arranged, if there is sufficient demand. In previous\nyears pairs have been entered in the Kinniard Cup\u00ab\nat Eton and the Midland\nTournament in Birmingham, and we hope to do the\nsame this year.\nWe try to make the club\nas much a social as an\nathletic club, most evenings\nending at the local. Players\nof all standards are welcome to come along.\nFREAK OUT TO THE\nKFLOY!\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE OCT.26 Tickets10/ or17/6 Double. I.C.6 pts.\nReading U.11 pts.\nAfter a good opening\nburst, I.C. put in an inept\nperformance at Harlington\nOR Saturday. Half-time\nsaw the score 6-0 to I.C,. Pine having kicked two\npenalties. From then on.\nfighting into the wind and\nand with the sun in their\neyes, I.C.'s play deteriorated\nleaving large gaps in a strained defence. Reading\ndeservedly scored a goal, a try and a penalty during\nthis half and only a very\nsound display by Wilde at\nfullback, and devastating ly display tackling by Chappell kept the score down.\nI.C. jump high for the ba ft GOLF SCENE\nLast year the \" Tigers \"\nin the Golf Club succeeded\nin pulling off some notable\nvictories, the most important of which was the winning of the ULU Golf Championships with a winning fj-round total of 462 shots.\nThe team's performance in\nInter-Collegiate matches was\nnot so good, last year's results being the poorest for\nseveral years, but with a good influx of Freshmen we\nhope to do considerably\nbetter this year.\nThis year sees the formation of a new Golf League\nto which all the top golfing\nColleges in the South East\nare affiliated; this league\noffers a good opportunity\nfor IC since our best team\nwould consist of six men\nwith single figure handicaps The ULU Golf Trials were\nheld at Sandy Lodge G.C. on Wednesday 9th October.\nIC was strongly represented\nand at least three members\nwere selected for one of the\nUniversity's two teams.\nI.

Details from\nthe Registrar.\nSTUDENT DEMAND SET As recently reported in the National Press, the\nNational Union of Students has held discussions with the\nCommittee of Vice-ChancellOrs and Principals on the\ngeneral subject of student participation in University life.\nNo Simple Solution\nThe statement confirmed,\n\" we have no doubt that the\nmachinery of student participation should be extended\nand improved we\nwould welcome the development of joint staff/student\nCommittees in new and\nmore effective forms.\" Student participation would depend on the willingness of a sufficient number of students to take part.\nAnother field the discussions covered was course\ncontent and teaching me-t hods. The statement stressed the the right of the\nteacher to decide on the way\nin which he presented his\nsubject. However there\nshould be opportunities for\nthe students to have discussions on the courses and\nteaching methods.\nThey issued a joint statement last week on the discussions which covered a wide range of different issues. In\nopening they said there was a\" widespread commitment\namong all members of universities to a concept of the \"aca-demi c community,\" but with changes jn the social situation Fx amina fm \u00ab \u00ab\nthe role of students within this community should be\n\"modified and modernised.\"\nThe problems of students making their views felt\neffectively was not simple, the statement said, as the de-c is ion making structures were generally complex.\nThe NUS \" seeks effective\nstudent presence on all relevant committees.\" Three\nbroad areas of operation\nwere outlined.\n(a) student welfare e.g. health services, catering and\naccommodation, where students should have some part\nin the decision\u2014making;\n(b) curriculum and cour-ses, teaching methods, major organisational matters,\nand the planning and development of the University,\nwhere student views should\nbe taken into accounts\n(c) decisions affecting-the\nposition of staff, admission\nto the University and academic assessment where student presence would be in-appropriate.\"\nExaminations were the\nnext subject discussed. -It\nwas noted that the NUS had\nalready cast doubt on the\nfairness of many examinations. While the universities\ndid their utmost to maintain\nthe standards of examinations some new methods\nhad been introduced, such\nas dissertations, projects,\n\" open-book \" examinations\nand continuous assessment.\nResearch was in hand \"with\nthe object of testing the\nvalidity of these devices.\" It\nwas \"common ground in our\ndiscussions that more re-1\nsearch and experiment on\nthe subject of examinations\nare required.\"\nDiscipline\nOn discipline the states-men., said there \" should be\nprovision for specific student participation in disciplinary procedures, especially in instances where a student's future might be at\nstake.\" Also universities\nshould \" examine the areas\nwithin which it would be appropriate for disciplinary responsibility to be delegated\nto the student body.\"\nWhofathis cripple anyway?\nGUILDS FRESHER MEETING\nThe Guilds Union meeting for Freshers a week last\nThursday was as usual a sketch of life at the College\nas it is not. The impression\nCertainly was that it is a melee of fun and frolic\nmixed with painting policemen white at Morphy Day,\nFancy Dress Balls with un-s peil able titles and just a little academic work for fla-v our ing. The lecture theatre was\ncrammed full with students\nsoaking up this half hour of\nconfusion. For a confusion\nit was and as such it broke\nthe ice of apprehension.\nThrough all this came a regular stream of advice.\nThe fresher s were told who\nto see if anything was disturbing Jhem and were\nurged to attend various\nfunctions that were useful\nor which guaranteed a smashing time.\nAfter a boisterous description of mascot ry at Imperial tie fresher s were informed a bot it the Old Centralians and what they were\nand invited them to attend\nthe dinners.\nNext, several union worthies were introduced including the Year RepresenVoting\ntat ives. They were told\nthat until 4th November,\nthey were to be represented\nby the 2nd year Reps, when\nthey would be helped to\nchoose two of their own;\none academic rep and one\nsports rep.\nThis was followed by a short chat about the two\nGuilds' affairs. One was the\nall-night fancy dress ball\nand the other an equally expensive dinner party.\nThe meeting broke up\nwith the traditional \"Boom-a laka\" chanted to the\nGuilds' Spanner held aloft\nin the president's right hand.\nThe Vice - Chancellors\nCommittee joined with the\nNational Union of Students\nin \" welcoming the Government's decision to accept the\nrecommendation of the\nLatey Committee that the\nlegal age of majority be\nlowered to 18.\" They also\nrecognised that this would\nalter some of the responsibilities of the University\nwith regard to student we l fare.\nThe last point the statement dealt with was freedom\nof speech. All members of\na University should be prepared to tolerate and protect \" the expression of unpopular opinions.\" However\nfreedom of speech must not\nbe exercised in ways which\ninfringe the rights and freedom of others.\"\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 16 October 1968 9\nTHE WW tor\nBARROW POETS\nThe incredible Bass Cato-fiddle\nIn recent years the Barrow Poets have made a large\ncontribution to the changed image of poetry. The name\nBarrow Poets was first used by a group of London University students who having been refused a licence to sell\npoems from a barrow (hence the name), decided instead\nto recite the same poems in London pubs. This was back\nin 1951, and for the next nine years the group continued\nas a loose association of people, no attempt being made\nto organise a professional grouping. In 1960 Susan\nBaker was elected chairman of the Barrow Poets of that\ntime, and it was from this point that things began to\nmove.\nThroughout the years from 1960 to the present, the\ngroup has been increasingly in demand at Festivals, in\ncolleges and schools, and has also made appearances on\ntelevision. The present group of six (Gerard Benson did\nnot appear at I.C.) have been together for five years,\nreciting having become a full-time occupation for all but\nGerard Benson, who retains a teaching post at the Central\nSchool of Speech and Drama. 4\nDespite their increasing demand in more cultured\nplaces, the Barrow Poets still like to continue their performances in pubs, and are at present doing a season of\nThursday night recitals at the \"Sir Christopher Wren.\"\nwhich finishes just prior to their December tour of\nAmerica. Since they have been resident at this one pub,\nthey have detected a change in the audience, which has\nchanged from being predominantly student and aesthetic,\nto one containing in the words of Susan Baker, \" people with\nmoney to spend.\"\nThe group get a grant from the Arts Council to allow\nthem to commission poems from such well known writers\nas Robert Graves, A.P. Herbert, George MacBeth-and\nRoger McGough. They are also supported by Guinness,\nwho .are at present running the Barrow Poets advertisement in the\" Piccadilly Circus news ree j. What then is the secret of their success ? How have-they been able to create a completely new atmosphere in\nwhich poetry can be enjoyed as another form of enter-tain ment, rather than being left for centuries to gather\ndust on shelves. Part of the answer is their choice of\nmaterial; their poems tend to be predominantly contemporary, and the current trend is one of poems on personal\nrelationships and problems, their recitals have something\nOf relevance to the everyday likes of their audiences.\nThere is also something in the way that they arrange their\nprogrammes, intermingling short groups of poems with\npieces of music (after played on such weird sounding\ninstruments as the muscle-in or the bass cato fiddle). The\ncomplete answer is not found however until one includes\nt the actual recitation of the poems. It is the intensity\nwith which they speak each line, the real meaning they\ngive each word which finally makes poetry come alive,\nRECENT\nFILM\nREVIEW\nThis is the first of what is to become a regular series\nOf film reviews by JOHN SPENCE. Our aim in these\narticles is to bring your to attention films that are comparatively little publicised, or those of particular interest\nto us as t tu dents or as scientists. We are not setting up\nas rivals to the daily press! John Speoce is President\nof the H.G, Wells Society.\nIt looks like it's going to be a great season for films !\nNew ones are being premiered weekly and there's a lot\nOf interesting stuff on the way. Before work started in\nearnest (and before my bank account turns red) I took\nthe opportunity to see some films which I thought some\nFelix readers might be considering, so, if you haven't been\nlooking too closely at the critics' columns, recently, or if\nyou have but possess a short memory\u2014this is for you !\nThe best of the three films I saw was \"Rachel.\nRachel\" (Curzon, Z). In the celluloid jungle which is\nthe film industry it can be of no comfort to those less\nsuccessful to see a big name make it twice over. But\nPaul Newman\u2014director and producer of the film\u2014makes\nno- apologies for doing just that. We all know about\nNewman's screen image of late\u2014laconic, almost reticent,\nin action and work but displaying an eloquence of facial\nexpression and nuance without which \" Hombre\" and\n\" Luke \" would't have come off, either as characters or\nfilms. To those who have seen his directing hand, how-ever, it is apparent that these are features of the man\nhimself, not just the image. Without restrained direction\nand many concessions to visual Tffect as the substitute\nfor dialogue, \" Rachel, Rachel\" would have flopped. It\ndoesn't and Mr. Newman can thank his wife's, Joanne\nWoodward, beautifully sensitive acting as much as he can\ncongratulate himself,\nRachel is a school-teacher, a spinster\u2014and a virgin.\nShe's all these and 35 years besides and, having reached\nthe zenith of her intellectual and sexual powers with no\nstimulation for the former or dissipation for the latter,\nshe Sees her descent to the nadir as frighteningly close.\nHer situation is made more desperate by her environment\n\u2014a stupid and pious old mother and lesbian (great performance from Estelle Parsons\u2014the hysterical Mrs.\nBarrow from \" Bonnie and Clyde\") for a best friend\ncombine in the sultry small town where she lives to make\nlife a misery and a breakthrough inevitable.\nIt happens when Nick, an old schoolmate, who is\nbasically a lecherous farmer masquerading as a highSchool teacher (which impresses Rachel )arrives on the\nscene showing something more than nostalgia in his at ti tude. Undaunted by Rachel's apparent un interest in\nhim\u2014Nick persists and the seduction occurs in a field,\nhe crude and she clumsy. The affair continues. For Rachel\nit's paradise\u2014she spends whole nights, even a week, away\nfrom mother and, with an affection born from desire, falls\nmadly in love with her man. To him, it's rather amusing\nuntil he realises what Rachel's need is leading to and lets\nhimself out by way of a subterfuge.\nIn the last, and most moving part of the film, Rachel\nis sustained only by the thought, the hope, the prayer\n.that she is pregnant. The woman's maternal instinct in\nher has always been as painful as the sexual one\u2014an\nimportant fact conveyed in the film by her occasional\nflights of fancy where what she wants to do and what she\nultimately does are in \"tragic contrast. An examination\nreveals her \" baby \" to be but a harmless cyst and for the\nfirs jt and only time in the film she cannot quell the tears.\nShe has to go away and at the end of the film there is\nnothing to say\u2014just a wondering if anything will improve.\nA film which only perceptive and sensitive men could\nmake, and in cameraman Gayne Rescher and screen playwright Stewert Stern Newman found two more to complete the trio. I 'll never know why he picked Margaret\nLaurence's obscure little story but, having done so, it's to his credit and our benefit that he made of it a very\nsignificant film.\nIn somewhat lighter vein is Dudley Moore's new film :\n\" 30 is a dangerous age, Cynthia.\" Rupert Street (Dud.)\n1- a night club pianist who is quite distraught at the fact\nthat, approaching 30, he is neither married nor in any\nposition to call his career a success. He resolves to make\namends on both scores in the space of six weeks so sets\nout to write a musical and get off with the girl in the next\nflat (Suzy Kendall).\nDud himself scripted, though, and, with the able help\nof director Joe McGrath, the film is at times very funny.\nIndeed Dudley Moore as a funny little man with some\nfunny voices is not a completely hopeless quest because\nthat is pr pec is ely what Dudley Moore is\u2014with a lot of\nmusical talent thrown in of course. But in the straight\nscenes its no go and, sad to say, Suzy Kendall doesn't quite make it either\u2014a disappointing fact when you recall\nwhat .she rose tp in \" Penthouse \" and \" Up the Junction.\"\nIt's a Chance to see Dudley Moore in colour, though,\nso if you can't wait for it to reach the suburbs go along\nto the Prince Charles cinema and have a giggle!\nJOHN SPENCE.\ni.e. FOLK CLUB\nMEETING\nThe I.C. Folk Club held\nits first meeting of the year\nlast Wednesday night, in the\nUnion Upper Refectory.\nThe club meets every fortnight and guests for the\nterm will include Johnny\nSilvo, Louis Killen and Diz\nDisley. They also hope to\nget John Renbourne early in\nthe Spring Term.\nThe club has flourished in\nrecent years because of the\nhigh quality of both guest\nand resident artists. The\nfirst meeting suggests that\nthis high level should be\nmaintained this year. The\n\" old residents,\" with some\npromising newcomers, provided ample support for the\nguests, Martin Carthy and\nDave Swarbrick, whose repertoire includes both in\ns tru mental s and traditional\nsongs.\nDuring their first set they\nplayed a variety of dances,\njigs, reels, hornpipes, etc. In\nthese Swarbrick took the\nlead, and his skill and control with both violin and\nmandolin were very imp res sive. Of the songs sung by\nCarthy \" John Barleycorn \"\nand \" Jack Orion \" were\nt well received. Here the accompaniment of Swarbrick\nsupplemented the singing of\nCarthy to good effect.\nThe second set was less\nimpressive, too many of the\nsongs tended to be of the\n\" ethnic gargle\" variety.\nTowards the end, however,\nthings improved and after a solo version of \" Davey\nLouston \" from Carthy, the\nduet finished the evening\nwith a rousing round of\nreels.\nVOLVO DAG BL AT concert\nFans will knOw, and\neveryone should know, that\nCream's farewell concert is\non November 26. Tickets,\nwhich will disappear rapidly,\ngo on sale at the Albert\nHall on October 31.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 16 October 1968\nWHO FOR R. C.S.U.? Pete Dol win or Gwyn Hughes Pete Dolwin is a third year Physics undergraduate who\nhas been extremely active around the college in his two\nyears here, some of the more responsible posts that he has\nheld being Union Projectionist, Physics department rep to\nRCSU, assistant librarian at the Haldane and secretary of\nthe external affairs committee of ICU.\nRecently he has been negotiating as ICU representative to Maria Assumpta over the affiliation of some of the\nIC clubs with those at M.A. As Physics department rep. last year he threw himself enthusiastically into Union affairs, and got to know\nexactly what the task of being President means. He has\nseen many faults arise in RCSU during that time\u2014the split\nthat emerged between the president and vice-president, the\nbreakdown of communications between the union and its\nmembers and the rise in presidential power. He intends to\nrectify all these faults.\n(i) Adolf, RCS vice-president, is proposing him\u2014\nsymbolic er f his feelings about team co-operation.\n(ii) He advocates the formation of an RCS broadsheet published alternately with FELLX, coupled with the\ncontinuation of the informal meetings with year reps and\n\" at home \" evenings when the officers will hold an informal\nsession with coffee when any member can easily make\ndirect suggestions for discussion.\n(iii) Pete believes team spirit to be the basis of RCS\nand is against personality cults. The attitude of the President should be to appreciate the trust placed in him by\nthe union not \" I am the President.\" Also any president at\nthe end of his office should stand trial as to how well he had\ncarried out his electoral promises.\nPete says that his other policies are : \u2014\n(1) Continued concentration on academic affairs and\nstaff-student relations, where IC Is probably the most\nadvanced college in the country.\n(2) Meet-the-Committee parties to be held this year\nfor the first time similar to that held in maths last year.\n(3) To visit each department regularly to get grass-roofs opinions for policies and comment. Also to hold\nregular hours in the President's room where the president\ncan definitely be found willing to meet any member of\nRCSU.\n(4) To improve communications between the various\ncommittees of RCSU, particularly to attend Ents meetings\nand assure a wider distribution of minutes.\n(5) To streamline the union meetings and to have\nmore interesting debates.\n(6) To run elections for next years officers in March\nto escape the \" exam twilight.\"\nHis main interest is in staff-student relations, and here\nle feels very qualified for he is on a first, and is sure that\na e cause of this the academic staff talk to him and listen\nto what he has to say. He appreciates that much work\nhas been done in this direction, but thinks that there is\nstill much room for improvement in certain de pts. In other fields Gwyn has many ideas. He wants to\nstreamline the year rep system by having more personal\ncontact between year reps and union officers. Carnival too\nshould be better organised by having greater co-ordination\nbetween Department reps so that, for instance, when out\ncollecting, one department does not depend on an area\nonly to find that another department has been there two\nminutes previously. Another of his ideas is that RXT.S. should not concentrate so many of their act irv it ics in the\nsummer term as at present.\nGwyn is ordinary\nWhen the nominations for R. C.S.U. President were\nfirst put up there was great consternation among the establishment that there was no willing and obvious candidate.\nThen in the Maths Department appeared Gwyn Hughes\non the nomination sheets, and people began.to ask \" Who's Hughes ?\"\nWell Gwyn is an ordinary member of the union. For\nthe past two years he has been a member of several I.C. Clubs and has helped when asked by Dept Reps. . . .\nThis is not a very great claim to fame, but it is necessary for a good President to have been active in union\npolitics ? \" No,\" says Gwyn, \" Because the majority of\nunion members are not up with union politics, which are\nall to often rather involved with procedure and get a little\ndull. A President who has not been too involved with\nunion politics would be more representative of R.C.S. opinion.\" Obviously a so-called \" grass roots\" candidate is going to produce fresher ideas than someone who\nhas been submerged in union politics all his college life.\nDuplication between \\C and RCS\nOne of the problems in such a large college as I.C. is that there is duplication of effort between I.C. and the\nconstituent colleges. Gwyn would like to see much\nSharper distinctions drawn between these organisations.\nGwyn Hughes is a friendly person and promises that\nif elected he will not forget that he used to be an average\nunion member and that they have just as much to say, and\nare just as important as anyone else.\nFLOOR REPS FOR SALE\nCommunication between\nthe college and \"Them,\"\nthe Union council, failed\nlast year. This year's floor\nreps are determined to\nchange this\u2014they are elected to change this\u2014they\nare elected specifically to\nhear your complaints, cries\nfor help and questions on\nall matters and to pass\nthem on to Council.\nSurgeries\nflopped\nLast year \"Surgeries\"\nwere held which flopped utterly for two reasons :\n(1) They were not publicised.(2) They were \" surgeries \"\nrather than discussions.\nThe floor reps want to\nlisten to you and will be\navailable twice weekly for\ncommunication with any\nunion member. They will\nbe waiting to meet you or\nlisten to you :\u2014\u2022\nEvery Friday lunchtime:\n2 Floor reps in Upper\nLounge, Southside\u2014just\nabove the TV. Every Monday lunchtime:\n2 Floor reps in Lower\nLounge Union \u2014\u2022 beside\nICWA bar.\nYour Floor Reps\nThe floor reps at present\nare:\u2014\nGeorge Assimakis, Physics 3, Selkirk 666.\nLilas Campion, Mines 3,\nBeit 103.\nPiers COrbyn, Physics\nPG, Tizard 621.\nDave Foster, Civil 3, Linstead 622.\nVinod Garga, Civil PG, Linstead 526.\nAnd one other to be elected\nat the Union meeting on\nThursday.\nPiers (Crowface) Corbyn\nsays he is ready to do anything (!!??) on your behalf.\nWhy not take him up on\nit?\nA Swinging Coffee Bar?\nThe Coffee Bar has been\noperating since the beginning of this term during\nthe week from 7.30 p.m. to\n10.30 p.m. and will continue until the end of October. This was the trial\nperiod set to estimate the\nneed for such a place. To\ncontinue Mr. Mooney requires a daily income of\n\u00a310, so far the income has\nonly averaged about \u00a38-\u00a310\nper day.\nThe possibilities of opening a Coffee Bar in a more\nSuitable location with an\nappropriate atmosphere,\nbackground music and\nsubtle lighting are very real\nif the need for such a place\ncan be proved. The cellars\nbeneath Garden Hall were\nput forward as the ideal\nlocation but have been disallowed by the authorities.\nThe present Coffee Bar is\nunattractive, too brightly\nlit, and conversation is\ndrowned by noise from the\nbar. In spite- of these de-traction s it is up to you to\nfrequent it for the next two\nweek so Mr. Mooney can\nbe persuaded, against has\napparent prejudices, to\nopen a swinging Coffee Bar\nmore in keeping with student traditions.

If I understand\nthis doctrine properly all three are God, each in his own\nright, none more powerful than the other, each separate\nand distinct and yet together they form a God who is\nmore powerful than the others.\nLC.U. as we all know, consists of three constituent\ncolleges. AH these have a union, each in their own right,\nrj one really more powerful than the other, each separate\nand distinct and yet together they form I.C.U. Here lies\nthe difference, I.C.U. is not as powerful as each of them.\nThis is not God we are talking about and I.C.U. is no\nspiritual power. In fact I.C.U. has little power of any\nkind. No matter what the constituent college pundits say\nthe strength that could be I. GU.'s suffers badly due to the\nexistence er f these three bodies.\nWhat are the arguments put forward for their re ten tion? In the past they have been emotional and fierce but basically they are weak and unconvincing when viewed\nimpartially. The problems of the scientist, miner and\nengineer are different we are told. What a lot of crap that\nis! Intercollegiate rivalry promotes a feeling of belonging\nin the fresher we are told, why not rivalry between I.C. and the other London colleges to replace that? There are\nmany colleges and universities larger than I.C. which\nn mage to survive and give the students a sense of belonging without this ridiculous system. The fresher is brainwashed into the constituent college\nSystem right from the first day but for many that is the\nrst time they have heard of the constituent colleges. They\ncame to Imperial College not the Royal College of Science\nor whatever and it is time that people realised that when\nthey have left all that will matter is that they have been\nto I.C.. and not that they have been to C.&G.

It is time that the strangle-hold they have on\n\u00a3C.U. was broken.

    "content": "FELIX16 October 1968\nHEATHEN THOUGHTS \u2014 editorial\nAfter RCSU's failures to elect a president in a seemly manner on two out of three occasions in the last\ntwo years, one hopes they will have more success this\ntime. In particular, let's hope we see no more of the\nirregularities in the ballot which marred last summer's election causing one of the stormiest RCSU meetings for\nsome time, the eventual withdrawal of the two candidates and the appointment of an acting president to steer\nthe anion through the summer.\nHowever, despite the recent controversy surrounding\ntheir elections, RCSU has, in principle, by far a more\ndemocratic election procedure than has Imperial College\nUnion. At least the former do hold a ballot of the whole\nunion with ample opportunity for everyone to cast a vote.\nThe election of the ICU president and secretary at a joint\nmeeting of Council (a conglomeration of the retiring and\nincoming council members) is merely a convenient means\nof disenfranchising the bulk of union members. It is said\nthat those who are on Council (and one must admit that\ncouncil members are elected in the main from the student\nbody) knew better than anyone else who will or will not\nmake the best available president, but, to my mind, the\nsystem effectively restricts the choice of president and\nsecretary to those who have served on council in the past.\nThis may ensure that all the candidates are experienced in\nUnion affairs but it can cut out people with fresh ideas\nand those in touch with the \" grass roots.\" However,\nmuch more important, now that the ideal of communication between council and the union floor is being freely\nbandied about, why not let .everybody have a say in electing the two most important officers of the Union as well\nas having a say in the policies and activities of it. Last\nyear, a motion to elect the ICU president from the whole\nunion narrowly failed to achieve the required majority\nfor it to become law. I hope that this very desirable\nchange will soon come about.\nNow, having said that everyone should have a vote\nin the presidential ballot. I hope as many as possible\npack the concert hall tomorrow to exercise votes they do\nhave at the ICU meeting. Important questions such as\nwhich charity we should support this year have to be\nanswered. .Register your opinion tomorrow.\nCHARITIES\nIan Williams writes short\nprofiles of the 4 charities\nwhich are to be nominated\nat tomorrow's Union meeting\nfor selection as I.C's Carnival\ncharity this year.\nUnmarried Mothers\nIf the National Council is\nallowed to collapse, the situation for unmarried mothers\nwill become even worse.\nThey will have lost an active\nwelfare organisation to turn\nto in need and a militant\npressure group that fights\nfor their rights. Until we\nlive in a society in which\neveryone is so educated\nand responsible that there\nare no unwanted children, it\nis essential that the work of\nthe fifty-year-old National\nCouncil should continue.\nOne in thirteen of all\nchildren born in England\nand Wales is illegitimate,\nand one out of six unmarried mothers goes into a Mother and Baby home to\nhave her child, afraid of the\nhostility and intolerance she\nis likely to meet in the outside world. The National\nCouncil for the Unmarried\nMother and her Child\nmakes these facts known to\nthe public by its work, and\nrecently announced that unless \u00a312,000 is produced\nimmediately it will have to\nclose down.\nMultiple Sclerosis\nMultiple (Disseminated)\nSclerosis is a progress m, degenerative disease, causing paralysis and pain\ngenerally throughout the\nbody, by damaging the\ncentral nervous system, in\nUnpredictable stages. Either\nalone, or in combination\nwith various inter current in-fec tion, the results are ultimately fatal.\nAbout 1 in 1100 persons\nin this country will, by present statistical evidence, become victims of this dis-ease. The number of\ndeaths, each year in Great\nBritain, caused by Multiple\nSclerosis and its complications is more than 1500.\nMainly, the disease affects\nyounger people between\nmid-teens and 45 years of\nage, tragically interfering\nwith a person's ability to\ncarry on working, to provide for hf s or herself or\ndependants. Owing to the\nlack of knowledge relating\nto its mysterious path o lo logical mechanisms, there\nis nO specific alleviation\nwith means to halt, or to re*\ntard the advance of the\ndisease.\nThe work of the Multiple\nSclerosis Research Fund\nLtd. is in the financing and\nextension of Medical Research on the disease.\nThe editor reserves the right\nto withdraw all or part of any\nletter from publication.Letters\nprinted contain the opinions\nof the correspondents and not\nnecessarily those of FELIX.\nR. C.S.U. Freshers Tea\nWe would like to express\nour concern at the parts we\nplayed in the fiasco which,\nwent under the name of\nRCS Freshers' Tea. We\nalso condemn the organisers\nfor their lack of foresight in\nallowing it to proceed as it\ndid.\nThe organisation was totally uncoordinated : many\nfresher s were unaware of\nthe time and place; and\nWhen they arrived there was\nnothing prepared for them,\nfew chairs, no teas and no\nunion officials.\nThe accepted purpose of\nthe Freshers' Tea is to introduce the Union. It would\ntherefore be infinitely preferable if all committee\nmembers attended and adequate guidelines for the tone\nof the affair were laid down,\nso that a balanced and coherent picture of the union's functions could be gained.\nA second year girl not only\nfound it extremely em baras sing, but also said, \" . . .\nMost fresher girls who have\nseen that fiasco will never\nwant to have anything to do\nwith R.C.S. again!\"\nPerhaps in the future the\nfollowing ideas could be\nconsidered; the appointment\nof a capable organiser; the\nconsideration of likely female reactions; and sensible\ntiming to avoid clashing with\nrefectory hours.\nWe sincerely hope that\nduring the rest of the year\nthe union will make a definite effort to reverse this\ninitial disastrous impression.\nA.D. MORRIS,M.G. LAMBERT.\nMiss J. HARRISIN,J. CRILEY\nG. WALTON, P. LEE, Miss L.D. STEAR, A. BROOKS\nFor space reasons, this letter\nhas been edited.\nDear Sir,\nThe letter of complaint\nconcerning the R. C.S.U. Freshers' Tea, states that\nsome of the people present\nwere embarrassed by the\nsketches presented. If this\nwas so, then I apologise to\nthem.\nSince the tea, the Union\nGeneral Committee discussed the format of the\nevent, and proposals by\nthat Committee have been\npresented for discussion before a Union Meeting.\nI would point out to the\nsignatories of the letter that\na Union Meeting is in fact\nthe best place to air their\nviews. Debate via this column is technically difficult\nto pursue to any conclusion\nand Felix reporters are capable of supplying any critical assessment of college\nevents that is necessary.\nJ.J. WARREN,\nActing President, R. C.S.U. Wellsoc\nDear Sir,\nThe first meeting of the\nH.G. Wells Society on\nOctober 7th, was, I feel, an\nunqualified success both for\nSir Barnes Wallis and the\nSociety.\nThe evening was only\nmarred by our inability to\naccommodate everyone\u2014a fact which I personally and\nthe Committee deeply re-pre t. It is on their behalf,\ntherefore, that I want to extend our sincere apologies\n\u2014 particularly to those\npaid-up members who were\nturned away. In the past\nwe have used closed-circuit\nT.V. to extend the first lecture to just a few more, but\nthis year none was available and we were limited by\nthe capacity of the lecture\ntheatre.\nWe hope this will not recur but in case it does, I would urge members and\nnon-members alike to arrive before 7.15 p.m., this\nbeing the only way to ensure a seat.\nWith thanks to all those\nwho comprised a most responsive audience.\n.Yours sincerely,\nJOHN C. SPENCE.\nChairman Wellsoc.\nShelter\nShelter is a rescue operation for Britain's homeless\nfamilies. It is a movement\nof people all over the country who are facing up to the\nreality of an emergency situation and the reality is that\nour housing problem will\nnot be overcome for at least\nten years. Protests will not\nalter that, but involvement\ncan.\nA representative committee distributes the money\nraised by Shelter to highly\nefficient voluntary housing\nassociations working in our\nworst hit housing areas.\nThese non-profit making\ngroups buy houses, improve\nthem, convert them into\ngood, simple homes and let\nthem at rents that those in\nmost urgent need can afford.\nHousing associations can\nborrow between five and\neight times the gift money\nthat shelter raises and save\na large, and precious, part\nof the existing housing\nstock. Gift money is essen-ti al, for the borrowed capital is re payed from rents:\nthe more1 you borrow, the\nhigher the rents and, if you\nborrow 100 per cent, then\nthe rents you need to charge\ncannot be paid by the most\ndesperate families.\nShelter can bring homes\nand happiness to thousands\nof families at present struggling against disintegration\nand breakup, in appalling\nslums.\nWorld Wildlife Fund\nThe World Wildlife Fund\nis an international charitable foundation devoted to\nthe concept that conservation is for the benefit of\nman. At one end of its\nscale of activities it is trying to save certain animal\nand plant species from extinction ; at the other end\nit extends over the whole intricate relationship between\nwater, soil, plants, animals\nand man himself\u2014the ecological web.\nThe object of the WWF\nis to keep alive as many as\npossible of the different\nkinds of birds, beasts and\nplants which have hitherto\nshared this planet with us.\nIn this context \"wildlife\"\nincludes anything which is\nalive and wild and the aim\nof the WWF is to perpetuate, for the enjoyment of\npeople, as much as possible\nof the natural world, which\nis an essential part of our\nhuman in v ironmen t. If\nthis object fails, many\nspecies will become extinct\nks a direct result of man's activities; many unique\nwild places will disappear\nfor ever.\nIf the WWF is selected\nfor I.C. Carnival Charity\nthis year, the money collected will go to help purchase an island in the Seychelles. This island would\nbe used as a research station investigating various\nphenomena affecting man\nand his environment It is\nhoped that the Biological\nDepartments of I.C. could\nparticipate in this Research\nStation.\nMealy Hypocrite?\nSir,\nJust what does RCS VicePresident Javad \"Adolf\"\nHashteroudian reckon he\ngot for his \u00a335 10s.0d.? What does he think he has\nachieved? What does Felix\nintend by making the whole\npointless affair front page\nnews?\nThere has recently been\na disaster in Persia, perhaps\nwe could hear about Mr.\nHashteroudian's work to alleviate the resulting suffering\nthere.\nYou say in your editorial\nthat you can't help thinking\nthat the social service OSS\nundertakes does more immediate good than a score\nof demonstrations on Vietnam. Why then headlines\nfor Hashteroudian and page\n8 for OSS in the first( Fresh-man) issue of Felix this\nyear?\nWon't the freshmen think\nthat you are a mealy\nmouthed hypocrite editing\nan irresponsible rag?\nBILL THORNLEY\n\n"

This\npost was left vacant by the\nmarriage of Anita Furniss\n(now Mrs. Long) this sum-mer.\nIan Jarvis was Mech\nEng. 1 \" sports\" rep last\nyear and organised collections for Carnival totalling\nmore than \u00a3600. For this\nwork he was awarded a C&G Union General award.\nLast year, too, he was the\nunsuccessful Vice-Presidential candidate in Guilds.\nHe regards Carnival\nmainly as a means of people enjoying themselves and\nnot as an organisation for\nextorting money out of the\npublic. He is quite prepared to collect less money\nthan last year if people get\nmore enjoyment out of it.\nHe does not want however\nto be associated with stunts\nthat offer little financial w turn. Incentives #hi ch are\nUsed to create* interdepartmental rivalry should come\nfrom firms, like-the prizes\nfor the raffle, and not from\nthe collections as this is the\nsame as embezzlement.\nHe is i still forming ideas\nabout Carnival activities,\nbut it is quite definite that\nthere will be no football\npools this year as it Only\nmade \u00a3200 last year. Carnival week is going to be a big thing this year and as a concession to commercialism there will be an Albert\nHall concert. Rumour has\nit that he may soon be making enquiries about a certain American duo.\nIAESTE\nThe International Association for the Exchange of\nStudents for Technical Experience (I. A. E.S.T.E.) last year\nprovided jobs abroad for 84 people from this College\nis 21 different countries ranging from Ireland to Japan.\nHowever the number that applied for such work was 271.\nThe difference in these odds of 3 to 1 against him\nfees to\nJ go up two numbers has increased\nover previous years due to\nfewer places being available\nin Britain for Foreign students to carry out vacation\ntraining work \u2014 although\nthe scheme is not a direct\nexchange, it is highly influenced by the number of\nplaces mutually available.\nthe I. A.E.S. T.E^n ances/ have suffered a loss since\nonly those placed paid a pli C fiSt tien t fee of 30/-, and\nthis number has dropped\nalarmingly. Consequently\nI. A. E.S.T.E. propose to\ncharge every applicant a registration fee of \u00a31 as\n<#ell as a placement fee.\nThis hardly seems fair,\nsince at present only about\n30 per cent, of students actually obtain any help from\nthis Association.\nI.

It is also hoped to\ncreate a weigh^training\ncentre there sometime this\nterm.\nGwyn HughICS Pete Dolwin\nUNION\nFEE INCREASE\nThe Union fees this year\nhave been increased by two\npounds to six pounds, the\nfirst increase for several\nyears. Because the Union\nfees are part of the College\nfee, the increase is levied, in\nmost cases, direct from the\nLocal Education Authorities.\nReserve\nThe increase should bring\nin nearly \u00a38000 a year extra\nto the Union, which will\nhelp to build Up the. Union's depleted reserve fund.\nHowever, since the Governing Body has sub sidi sed the\nUnion to the tune of \u00a31,100\nin 1966-67 and \u00a33.200 in\n1967-68 while negotiations\nfor an increase were in pro-gres s, the full benefit of this\nextra \u00a38,000 will not immediately be felt.

    "content": "FELIX16 October 1968 3\nBARNES WALLIS:\nTHE STRENGTH OF ENGLAND\nWells Soc.'s first Meeting was packed, and one of the\nauthors of this art i cie, arriving at the last minute, only just\nmanaged to get in. At least a hundred and fifty were\nturned away when the lecture theatre became full.\nLively and Witty\nLord Jackson of Burnley, Wells Soc.'s new President,\nintroduced the Speaker, Sir Barnes Wallis CBE, as having\na\" fire in his belly and a furnace in his head \" and Sir\nBarnes proceeded to demonstrate this with a lively and\namusing lecture. Looking a sprightly 60, which belied his\ntally of 81 years, he made his lecture technically straightforward but always s pie ed with inventiveness and wit, the\nformer consolidating his reputation and the latter to the\ndelight of his audience. His subject was \" The Strength\nof Eneland.\"\nHie Colts transform Ke and Chips\nFRESHERS' HOP\nSea Power\nSir Barnes started by demonstrating that most ancient civilisations owed their\nrise to the development of\nsea transported their prosperity to their possessing a shoreline. He made the\npoint that wealth was dependent on trade which in\nturn was dependent on\ntea transport, the cheapest\nr and most convenient form\nboth now and in the past.\nHe then showed that Britain,\nwith her 2,500 miles of well-developed coast, was effectively in the centre of modern civilisation and even\nsurpassed the Soviet Union\n<n trading convenience.\nNautilus\nTo Sir Barnes, therefore,\nthe obvious way for Britain to once more rule the\nwaves is to travel beneath\nthem. He has in mind\nthe legendary North West\npassage which, he believes,\nwas found by the atomic\nsub. \" Nautilus\" when it\nwent through the Bering\nStraights and under the\nNorth Pole. He proposes\nan enormous cargo submarine which can travel\nhalf way round the world at\na depth of over 5,000 feet.\nY6u can forget about nuclear power too\u2014his vessel\ncarries liquid oxygen, liquid\ncarbon dioxide and a me thy lene-based fuel which leaves\nyou with a tank full of CO, at the end of your voyage\nwhich you \" sell to Mr. Walls at 4s. a pound thereby\nrecovering the cost of your\nentire trip!\"\nAir Power\nThe second half of the\nlecture was concerned with\nthe problem of restoring\nBritain's air supremacy.\nAnswer: build a craft\ncapable of reaching speeds\nof Mach 7 or 8 which would\nenable it to fly half-way\nround the w rid without re-fuelling. With the aid of a film and some lucid dia-grams, Sir Barnes showed\nthat the approach to this\nproblem is through the development of his famous\n\" Swing-Wing \" concept.\nSwing Wing\nThe sad story of the Government's short-sight and\nthe Americans' subsequent\ncornering of his idea is- well\nknown, but Sir Barnes\noffered some consolation by\nmarvelling at the Americans' ineptitude in trying to\nmake swing-Wing work \"for\nlack of a single steel strut.\"!\nFable\nHe finished his lecture\nwith a poetic quotation\nabout a knight who, wounded by the sword, lay and\n\" bled awhile \" only to rise\nre vitali sed' and con q er\nanew. One wasn't sure\nwhether he referred to England or himself \u2014 either\nwould have been appr opr i ate. One has a sneaking\nsuspicion, however, that\nwhile England may ascend\nwithout Barnes Wallis\u2014\nBarnes Wallis will never ascend without England!\nI.C. CARR I.N. QU ARR INTO N The Freshers' Hop turned\nout to be for most people a peaceful and enjoyable\nevent. The attendance was\nput at o yer900, of which\nonly a minute proportion, or\nso it seemed, were of the\nfairer sex. The noise to\nwhich the Union building\nwalls and some of the people\nshook was provided by three\ngroups: the Sweet from\nEdmonton, the Bananas\nfrom Coventry and the Colts\nfrom Barking. There was\nno general agreement as to\nwhich group was the best.\nPerhaps of interest, though,\nwas the fact that this was\nthe first professional engagement of the Sweet, who\nin the near future are to\nrecord an L.P. and single\nfor release in the USA and\nGermany.\nFor the fresher s, the hop\ncame at the end of their hectic first week. Most of the\nmales arrived hoping to get\ntheir hands on one of the\nrare birds. As the available\ntalent was quickly booked\nmost turned their energy\nfrom stalking the prey to\npushing through the crush\nto the bar. Over the odd\npint many decided to seek\nmore lucrative pastures the\nfollowing week; who can\nblame them? As for the female fresher s, all I can say\nis : You lucky lot.\n\" How doI turn my grant cheque into money? We'll help you\nThe best thing any Freshman can do with\nhis first grant cheque is take it into the\nnearest branch of Westminster Bank and\nopen a current account.\nFor one thing, other people are going to want\nto pay you money in the future. Most of them\nwill pay by cheque\u2014and this will go on being an\nembarrassment until the day when you finally\nopen an account.\nMuch more important, a cheque-book is still\nthe easiest way of paying out money. You no\nlonger have to carry a lot of loose cash in your\npocket which can get lost or squandered away\non trifles. Instead, your cash stays where it\nbelongs, safe in the Bank\u2014and the cheque-book\nin your pocket still lets you buy what you want,\nwhen you want. Afterwards your Bank statement tells you where the money went; and this\ntoo helps you to save.\nIt makes you feel taller\nLater, your Westminster Manager will be able\nto give you advice on how to make those savings\ngrow. He will become a trusted friend (this is not\nflannel; he will) who can give you practical help\nat the times when you need it most-during your\nyears at University, and throughout your life.\nBesides these (and other) practical advantages\na Westminster cheque-book gives you something just as important: status. It proves that\nyou are an established adult in your own right.\nThis can be a very considerable asset.\nIfyou are interested, then we suggest you call on\nyour nearest Westminster Manager\u2014or fill in the\ncoupon on the right.\n| 1\nWe'll help you... in all sorts of ways.

His message was\nyou've never had it so\ngood \" or rather \" you've\nnever had the Union so\ngood.\"\nThe freshmen then took\nover. Opinions on the future of fresher s differed\ngreatly. Mr. Eden (Maths\nI.) was so absorbed with the\npresent (he had joined 12\nsocieties on Freshers Day)\nthat he saw no future and\ndid not wish to.\nMr. Asi Sing Bama, on\nthe other hand described the\nfuture as \" loving, charming\nand pleasing.\" He saw vast\nopportunities for scientist-fresher s to improve the\nWorld. So far, he said,\nScience had produced\nbombs and starvation.\nfresher s are out\nAn extremely witty speech\nfor the motion was given by\nPenny Clark. She began by\nstating that this year, fresh-ers were definitely out and\nshe pointed out that Hornsey had given them up. She\nwent on to predict the fates\nof this year's fresher s. These\nranged from falling off\nmountains to getting thrown\nout of hall or digs and having to walk the em bank ment. To the relief of the\nparticipants Miss Clark did\nnot qualify for the tankard,\nas she was not a fresher.\nA speech which, although\nnot polished enough to win\nthe Tankard, was much appreciated by the audience,\nwas that given by N. de\nKlerk (Physics I). He arrested the attention of the\nhouse by beginning \" Cripes\nif this debate doesn't remind\nme of an abo's Loin Cloth \"\nHe produced an impressive\nlist of statistics on the mental health of students, in reply to a point brought up by\na previous speaker.

    "content": "FELIX16 October 1968\nINT HAPPENINGS\nIN ENTS\nThe Entertainments Committee must be congratulated\nfor the way they managed last year to provide groups and\nideas which were widely appreciated within the College.\nAlso they made a large profit for th z first time in years.\nAt the end of the-first, term last year the committee were\n$500 in debt; within four months this became a \u00a31,000\nprofit. This was entirely due to the highly imaginative hard\nwork and enthusiasm of Pete Nicolls, who, sadly at the\ncost of bis college place, revolutionised the ideas behind\nf colle ee entertainments.\nGood\nAttractions\nHe managed to overcome\nthe usual committee red\ntape and acting as booking\nmanager was able to book\nbigger and more attractive\ngroups than had ever been\ndone before. He showed\nthat with good publicity and\nhard work, despite the risks\ninvolved, large profits can\nbe made even with the\nlimited facilities at College.\nWith amazing foresight he\nbooked Joe Cocker and\nSpooky Tooth, who only\nweeks afterwards became\nmuch sought after per-former s. His Traffic concert was a huge success.\nAmong the many new ideas\nhe injected into Ents was\nthat of holding Friday night\nconcerts. The main reason\nwhy Pete Nicholls was so\nsuccessful was that he had\ncontacts within the pop industry (he is now road manager for Joe Cocker) and\nalso he was not afraid to\nfollow his ideas through to\ntheir conclusion.\nThis Years\nChairman\nNot surprisingly, Pete\nNicholls was to be this\nyear's Chairman, replacing\nKeith Guy who held the\npost last year. It is sur pris ing, however, that ideas\nformulated and agreed on\nlast year are being dis-banded, especially the idea\nof Friday night concerts\nwhich I understand the acting Chairman (the post is\nstill officially vacant) Keith\nGuy is not in favour of this\nyear. Surely Ents should\ncontinue in the same way as\nlast year, providing originality as well as the Usual\n\u00a315 groups that grace the\nUnion on most Saturday\nnights.\nI think that new blood\nshould be infused as much\nas possible into an organisation such as Ents which\nthrives only on new ideas\nand different approaches. It\nwould be beneficial to Ento\nif tk fy elected a new Chairman and let Keith Guy\neither rise to join his friends\nin the Union hierarchy or\ntake the job of Ents tre a surer. I understand he\nwould get a lot of support\nif he chose the latter.\nSerious\nOutcome\nThere are few things as\nboring as college politics\nbut, whatever the outcome\nof the pending elections for\nthe post of chairman, Ents\nwho have always been\nplagued by friction within\n(there was a strong move\nlast year to oust Keith Guy\nfrom his post) and harsh\ncriticism from all sections\nof the college community,\nshould settle down and produce Entertainments which\nare appreciated. They\nmanaged to do it last year.\nMARTIN FAIR CLOUGH THEY TELL ME...\nSTUDENT\nHOUSES\nDave Harris tells me that\nthe complex business of\nmoving into Student Houses\nis being mastered. When\nI spoke to him, furniture\nwas still arriving and something was about to be done\ntowards removing the dirt\nleft in the rooms by the\nbuilders\u2014and the previous\noccupants.\nLack of\nAmenities\nHowever, the complaints\nstill roll in about lack of\ncooking and other amenities,\nfurniture and inadequate\ntoilet fac ii l ties. There are about five bogs\nand baths for 60 and a third\nof the rooms have wash-basins. The real problem,\nICU secretary Harris and\nhis lads agree, is the ground-floor and basement, where\none wash-basin is meant to\nserve them all.\nRise in\nHall rents?\nIt's clear that something\nmust be done about selling\nStudent Houses to next\nyear's potential applicants.\nHarris agrees that a major\ndifficulty in attracting students of the right calibre\nfrom the lure of the well-appointed and convenient\nHalls is the unfavourable\ncomparison of Hall and\nStudent House rents. As the\nCollege refuses to sub sid is e the latter, it could be that\nHall rents will have to rise.\nSecond\nHouse\nScandal\nBut the biggest scandal\nconcerns the unfortunate\nwould-be residents of the\nsecond Student House. The\nstudent-warden, Ian Wells,\nwrote on 21st August to tell\nhis prospective residents\nthat they couldn't move in\nat the beginning of term and\nthey would have to find\nalternative accommodation\nthrough U.L. U. lodgings\nbureau. Naturally, the accommodation they did find\nat such short notice left\nmuch to be desired. Dave\nHarris has fitted as many as\npossible into his house and if\nhe'd known earlier, space\nmight have been found for\nmore.\nPrevious\nWarning\nHowever, the real surprise,\nis that Ray Phillips, last\nyear's President, realised\nlast June that the second\nhouse wouldn't be ready until Christmas. Harris knew\ntoo, and placed the bottom\n16 successful applicants on\nthe waiting list\u2014so the people nominated by the Halls\nfor the second house\nwouldn't lose both a Hall\nand a House place. Miss\nBurns in the Halls of Residence Office says that everyone who went to Union\nGeneral Meetings knew.\nBuilding\nTricks\nFormer Mines' President,\nWells, told me that the\nplaces in his house should\nnever have been allocated,\nbut also blamed the college\nauthorities and especially the\nbuilders. Apparently it's a favourite trick in the building business never to give a date when the work will be\nfinished, and Wells had to\nbadger the Clerk of Works\non the site, for his in form a tion.\nWhich leaves our poor\nputative residents wondering\nwhere to go next knowing\nthat somewhere \"someone\"\nhas blundered.\"\nDROP\nOUTS\nFailure rate is something\nthat concerns us all and it's good to see the College tak-ing-an interest. A sub-com-mitte e of the Medical Services Committee started by\nstudying the medical aspects\nof certain cases of failure,\nand the registry now informs\nRob Collinge's ICU welfare Committee that they\nare broadening their scope.\nThis summer the University\nGrants Committee reported\nthat only 9 per cent of Arts\nstudents failed, but the figures for scientists and engineers were much higher\u2014\n14 and 22 per cent respectively. The well known\ni higher failure rate of Women at I.C. is apparently\npeculiar to science and\ntechnology, although more\nwomen leave without de\ng rees for what the report\nterms \" other reasons.\" The\nfailure rate for overseas\nstudents is also higher than\nfor home students.\nNo figures are yet avail\nable, despite promises from\nthe College that they would\nbe, to compare this year'sI.C. failure rate with last\nPhysics 2, however, regards\nlosing about 20 members\nover the summer as \"usual.\"\nChris Parker\nThey tell me that Chris\nParker (known to his enemies as Cf) fears an anti-candidate will be found to\nkeep him off council. To\nmany, the spectacle would\nbe rather ironic; after all an\nanti-candidate against the\nright would leave them rather hoist with their own\npetard.\nSpike Bant in\nAll Southside seems certain that popular Spike Bantin is the favourite for the\nHalls rep. vacancy on council. If Spike has his way, it\ncould be the last time the\nrep. is elected by the Halls'\nin-crowd and he plans too\na big shake-up in Halls selection procedures. There\nis a touch of irony here, too,\nbecause Spike could well\nfind his way onto Council\nthrough the failure to return of Dick James, his proposer for floor rep. in his unsuccessful bid to get onto\nCouncil 1st June, Which all\nseems only fair to those who\nfelt the well-known antipathy between James and\nICU cost Bantin that ele c tion.\nLES EBDON\nThe first subject I would like to deal with in Biis issue\nis money or, to be more exact, Union finance. Last year,\nout of our total Income of about \u00a321,000 nearly \u00a315,000\nwas in the form of Union fees. These fees are included in\nthe College fee, which means that for most of you they\nare paid by the body that pays your grant. The fee has\nbeen four pounds for many years and is one of the lowest of\nany college or university in the country. For as long as I can remember, people have been talking about our fees\ngoing up and now at long last it has happened.\nCollege fees have gone up by two pounds a head, as\nyou will nave seen in a letter the Registrar sent to all\nstudents. Of this, the Union is to get 30s. Because the\nGovernors had been unable to negotiate a fee increase for\nus until now, they have provided the money to meet our\nlosses for the past few years. This extra finance was\nabout \u00a33.000 ya st year and a total-of \u00a34,300; the other\n10s. of the fee increase will be used to pay this total back to\nthe governors and then the Union will receive the extra 10s. as well.\nThis means that we shall now be able to start to put\nmoney back into the Union reserves, which will be needed\nfor the eventual refurnishing of the Union areas in Southside and for the furnishing of College Block.\nEven so, we should have some money left over and\nthe expansion of Union activities, which of necessity has\nbeen slowed down of recent years, may now have more\nchance to go ahead.\nEVENING COFFEE\nLast year a scheme was concocted by the Overseas\nStudents Committee and by the Welfare Committee for a Coffee Bar, run in the evenings. Everyone seemed to have\na different idea about where it should be, ranging from\ncellars on North Side, Princes Gardens, to the old Snack\nBar in Beit, which will close when the new facilities open\nin College Block. Eventually Southside Snack bar and\nUpper Lounge was agreed on, as at least the temporary\nhome, and it has been opened for a trial period of one\nmonth. If it is a success, then it will carry on and perhaps\neven move to a better home. So if you don't drink or\ndon't feel like drinking, or just fancy a snack in the evening,\nthen try Southside Coffee Bar, open from 7 p.m. to 10.30\np.m. LODGINGS BUREAU\nSome people prefer being in London, some don't, bu4 almost all agree that finding somewhere to live is \"still the\nbiggest problem. In the past, the London University\nLodgings Bureau has been unable to provide yer y much\naccommodation in the area of IC or very much in the\nIprm of flats or bed sitters. This has cut down their use to\na lot of IC students. Now a West London Branch is being\nstarted up and it is hoped to install it on the ground floor\nof 8 Princes Gardens around the end of November or the\nbeginning of December. I hope that this new service will\nbe able to spread its wings and deal with local accommodation as well as digs in the outer areas like Putney or\nWimbledon.\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification ?\nExercise your ow a discrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nLAM LEY'S AM for your\u2014\ni BOOKS\nmF ART MATERIALS\n\u2022\n>\nY PAPER BACKS\n\u2022\nSTATIONERY\nS \u2022\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, 8.W.7 "
