    "content": "Siya Kulkarni\nInvestment Society Writer\nAcase in point is that of pension funds,\nwith long-term investment horizons,\nintegrating ESG into their portfolios in order to drive\nimpact and consider financial returns for clients in\nlight of climate risks.\nCalls for ESG, and environmental considerations\nin particular, are getting increasingly louder among\nthe younger generation, making another long-term\ninvestor \u2014 college endowments \u2014 subject to similar\ntransition risks.\nEmerging trends\nIn a 2018 report by S&P Global, Kate Murtagh,\nMD of sustainable investing at Harvard Management\nCo. Inc., defines an endowment as a \u201cperpetual asset\u201d,\nenabling long-term investment strategies. While\ncollege campuses have seen student protests calling for\nan end to fossil fuel investments, the report also noted\nthat colleges did not respond immediately \u2014 citing the\nexample of University of Pennsylvania, which in 2016\nruled against stopping fossil fuel investment.\nA 2020 report by the Intentional Endowments\nNetwork took into consideration the case of 11\ncollege endowments in the United States, concluding\nthat an ESG approach to investing could help these\nendowments \u201creduce risk, avoid losses, uncover\nopportunities for strong performance, and improve\noverall financial returns\u201d, looking into endowments\nof all sizes. The report was interesting in its approach\nto a college endowment\u2019s role as a financial institution\nand fiduciary, including the endowment within its\ndescription as a \u201csocial purpose institution\u201d.\nESG adoption as a strategy to enhance returns has\nseen mixed responses from endowments, according\nto a 2021 Captrust survey. While 91% of adopters of\nESG strategies surveyed reported that ESG integration\neitherenhancesordoesnotimpactreturns,67%ofnon-adopters reported the same views on ESG strategies.\nWhen it comes to ESG strategy incorporation,\nclimate change and carbon has emerged as the top\ncriterion for college endowments in the US, followed\nby conflict risk (which includes terrorist or repressive\nregimes), according to the US SIF Foundation.\nInterestingly, the same data also reveals \u201cfossil fuel\ndivestment\u201d further down into ESG investment\ncriteria, and \u201cenvironmental considerations \u00ad\n\u2014 other\u201d\nas even further down!)\nIn more recent wins for campaigners, an increasing\nnumber of college endowments have announced\ndivestment from fossil fuels, including Harvard\nUniversity, University of Cambridge, and University\nof Oxford, reports Investment Monitor. The article\ncites a report by Callan, which shows that fiduciary\nresponsibility and improved risk profile are key drivers\nfor endowments to incorporate ESG factors into their\ninvestment strategy.\nImperial College Endowment: The story\nso far\nPrevious Felix articles have held to question Imperial\nCollege London\u2019s own sustainability efforts, including\nits engagement with oil & gas giants. Meanwhile,\nthe College\u2019s Socially Responsible Investment (SRI)\nPolicy, launched in March 2020, lists some of its key\nfocus areas online, which are supposed to align with\nImperial\u2019s mission \u201cto achieve enduring excellence\nin research and education in science, engineering,\nmedicine and business for the benefit of society\u201d.\nThe College is firm against investment in tobacco\nand illegal arms; however, it continues engagement\nwith Big Oil, according to online documentation\nthat discusses considerations between divestment and\nengagement approaches. In the statement, the college\nopts to engage with companies that show an alignment\nwith the Paris Agreement. The statement read:\n\u201cThe group discussed ways to amplify impact of\nthe Endowment given its modest size, for example by\nmeans of stewardship services to combine resources\nand collaborate with like-minded investors. It was also\nclear that the Endowment\u2019s impact was boosted when\ncombined with Imperial\u2019s other means of influence.\nMajor fossil fuel companies like BP and Shell value\ntheir relationships with Imperial, not least because\nof our world-class research collaborations and the\nfact that they employ many of our graduates, and we\neducate many of their current employees.\u201d\nTheextenttowhichthesecompaniesshowalignment\nwith the Paris Agreement, however, is unclear. A recent\nstudy by thinktank InfluenceMap showed that climate-focused communications and advertising by fossil fuel\nand oil incumbents is on the rise, with 60% of the\ncommunications having \u201cgreen\u201d claims. On the other\nhand, the study also showed that on average, green\ninvestments made up about 12% of capex budgets,\nand many of their climate solutions are more emissive\nsolutions (including natural gas, a methane emitter).\nUniversity endowments as drivers of\nchange\nAccording to the American Council on Education,\nan endowment is a pool of assets invested by an\neducational institution, comprising donations or gifts\nthat enable colleges to make long-term commitments\nto support future generations. They serve institutions\nand the public by providing stability, leveraging sources\nof revenue encouraging innovation and stability, and\nallowing for long term investment horizons.\nThe council notes the vital role college endowments\nhave played in pre-empting future problems and\nsupporting students, noting how endowment spending\nincreased as a response to COVID-19 to ensure safer\nand productive educational environments for students.\nThe burgeoning climate crisis and the increasing\nrisks it poses to our quality of life imply that students\ntoday and in future generations will likely be impacted\nbysimilardisruptionstotheirstudies,withincreasingly\nsevere ecological disasters. Acting on these problems\ntoday, in light of the fiduciary duty that colleges have\ntowards their stakeholders, will serve as a means to\nmanage and mitigate similar problems while driving a\nhigh-quality dialogue on sustainable transition, at the\nrequisite pace of change the world so desperately needs.\nThe case for cleaner, greener university endowments\nAs environment, social and governance (ESG)\nconcerns percolate into the financial sector, long-term\ninvestors in particular are becoming wary of physical\nand transition risks that climate change might pose to\ntheir portfolios.\n__\n__ Investment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Harry Schlote\nBusiness\nic.investmentsociety ic.investmentsociety\nic\u2013investment\nADD OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES FOR THE LATEST EVENTS, NEWS & OPPORTUNITIES\n\u2014\nFRIDAY. 4TH NOVEMBER 2022\n\u2014\n21\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"

Unfortunately, this means parts of my brain that\nshould be full of stress-strain calculations and material properties are instead spilling over with an excessive number of song lyrics. The Arctic Monkeys are\nwell known for unique lyrical and musical arrangements and vast range of styles; in honour of their recent album release, here are 20 of my favourites from\ntheir other albums.\n\u2018Old Yellow Bricks\u2019\n\u2018You are the fugitive/But you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re\nrunnin\u2019from\u2019Apersonalfavourite:thewhimsyofthe\nWizard of Oz seeps into what sounds like a \u2018regular\u2019\nrock song. There\u2019s an undertone of uncertainty in it\nthat keeps you slightly on edge, and the yellow brick\nroad references are used as a metaphor for leaving\nhome to go to a big city and realising it\u2019s not what\nyou really wanted.\n\u2018One Point Perspective\u2019\n\u2018Dancing in my underpants/I\u2019m gonna run for\ngovernment\u2019 There\u2019s no better example of the\nArctic Monkeys\u2019 genius \u2013 a combination of quirky\nsounds and all-over-the-place lyrics. Alex Turner\u2019s\nheavy enunciation highlights his Yorkshire accent\ndistinctively as he talks about losing track of your\nchildhood dreams and goals as you get older.\n\u2018I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\u2019\n\u2018Your name isn\u2019t Rio/But I don\u2019t care for sand\u2019 Hands\ndown the best song for going crazy in the club \u2013 an\ninstant and relentless adrenaline boost. It\u2019s arguably\ntheir highest energy song and shows off Turner\u2019s\npenchant for referencing pop culture.\n\u2018Piledriver Waltz\u2019\n\u2018Sat in the back booth/Near the pamphlets and the\nliterature on how to lose\u2019 A more acoustic version\nof this was featured in the film Submarine, and it\u2019s\na huge contrast from the track above. Piledriver\nWaltz is mellow and could lull you into a sense of\nmelancholy with its lyrics that don\u2019t entirely agree\nwith its backing music.\n\u2018Fluorescent Adolescent\u2019\n\u2018You took a left off Last Laugh Lane\u2019 Contains a\nbrilliantly funky riff and is almost a rap in the way it\u2019s\nsung. You know it\u2019s lyrically going to be a good one\nwith a name like \u2018Fluorescent Adolescent\u2019, and it\u2019s a little\ncomedic in a precise way.\n\u2018Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts\u2019\n\u2018He\u2019s pinched your bird and he\u2019d probably kick my\nhead in\u2019 Turner sounds a bit old-fashioned here,\nlamenting the loss of a girl \u2018stolen\u2019 by another guy,\neven though he didn\u2019t miss her when they first broke\nup.

Jamie Cook\u2019s punchy guitar\npunctuates Turner\u2019s sentences, and there\u2019s a huge\nrange of different-sounding sections that keeps things\ninteresting.\n\u2018Four Out of Five\u2019\n\u2018The information-action ratio/Is the place to go\u2019 One\nof their slower ones, as are many on this album, and\nfull of fun wordplay.

    "content": "While it\u2019s too late to write a review\non Blues for an Alabama Sky,\nwhich I watched last Friday night at the\nNational Theatre, it was so good I felt\ncompelled to write an article about the\ntheatre all the same, to share even just\nsome of its brilliance and magic, and to\nlet others in on the secret finding cheap\nseats (or standing space).\nI couldn\u2019t believe my luck when I\nfound out that the National Theatre\ndoes \u00a35 tickets if you\u2019re aged 16-18 (\u00a310\ntickets if you\u2019re aged 19-25 \u2013 but they\ndidn\u2019t even ask for any ID, just waved\nme in after seeing the date and QR\ncode on the ticket). There\u2019s a fantastic\nselection of plays to choose from, and\nif they are a similar quality to Blues\nthen you are in for something special.\nAs I mentioned before, Blues was\nfantastic. Some might say parallels could\nbe drawn with A View from the Bridge,\nbut Pearl Cleage\u2019s writing combined\nwith the rotating set and Samira\nWiley\u2019s stunning voice created a vision\nof burning emotion, hungry dreams\nand startling tragedy. Five stars and a\nstanding ovation from me all the way.\nHowever, if you want to go to The\nCrucible (whose run is nearing its\nend), you\u2019ll have to try your luck with\nFriday Rush tickets, which is where\nyou click on a link at 1pm on Friday\nand get put in a randomly assigned\nqueue for cheaper tickets for shows\nfor the next week. There\u2019s a comment\non the page saying if you\u2019ve got a\nnumber bigger than 150 you\u2019re going\nto be waiting for a while - I was 718th.\nThis got me wondering: what else is\noutthere?Itturnsoutthereisquitealot.\nI found that at The Old Vic they do\nsomething called \u201cPWC \u00a310 Preview\u201d\ntickets for the first five performances\nof every show. Then I went looking for\nstudent concessions and couldn\u2019t find\nany, so I\u2019ll have to wait until I\u2019m over\n60 to get a discount there! The Young\nVic does a similar thing: \u00a310 tickets for\nfull-time students and people under 25.\nUnfortunately, I couldn\u2019t find much\nfor the Royal Albert Hall apart from\na discount of 7% on a dodgy website\npage called \u201cStudent Discount\u201d. If\nyou find anything better, let me know.\nAt BFI Southbank, for cinema\nenthusiasts under 25, they offer \u00a33\ncinema tickets (for any screening)\nand \u00a35 festival tickets. They do older\nfilms, foreign films, the latest releases:\nsomethingforanyon(Imustalsomention\nthe Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re does \u00a35 tickets for\nunder 25s. About a 5-minute walk from\nSouth Kensington campus, as well).\nContinuing with my investigations,\nthings got better and better\u2026\nIf you\u2019re a classical music fan, the\nOrchestra of the Age of Enlightenment\noffers a great bargain of \u00a35 for any seat\nif you\u2019re a student. There isn\u2019t a huge\nchoice, but after the next performance\n(Sounds for the End of a Century,\nfeaturing works by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\non the 26th of January), the choice\ngoes Handel Bach Mozart Mozart,\nwhich isn\u2019t half bad for half a tenner.\nMeanwhile, The Royal Opera House\ndoes\u00a311standing/restrictedviewtickets\nso you can file in alongside people who\nhave paid \u00a3235 to see the same thing.\nAndthenthenthereisthewell-known\none at The Globe and its sister theatre,\nthe Sam Wanamaker Playhouse of \u00a35\nstanding tickets. Henry V is the only\nplay showing throughout November,\nand Hawkawatis: Women of the Arabian\nNights begins on the 1st of December.\nI haven\u2019t even begun to look at the big\ntheatres and see if they do last-minute\ndiscounted tickets for the big names like\nPhantom of the Opera, The Mousetrap or\nHamilton.Nextmonth\u2019sproject,anyone?\nLastly, a call to any theatre lovers out\nthere who would like to come to any of\nthese!

That is a\ntrue fact. And with the Union\u2019s finances\ngutted by pandemic closures and rife\nembezzlement, a bushel of golden retriever\npuppies was well beyond its price range.\nLuckily for the Union\u2019s politburo, so-called\n\u201cSpiny Dennis\u201d, the wandering salesman\nwho can often be seen sleeping in the\ncrevices around Beit Quadrangle, was able\nto offer a cost efficient solution. Whilst\nthe cost of a golden lab is stratospheric\nand still rising, the cost of an hour with\nbetween six and eight underfed porcupines\nremains at its historic rock-bottom price\npoint.\nHow the health and safety managers wept,\nthen, when therapy sessions booked by\nBlindSoc got off to a thorny start. Through\nmeans that elude even the most hawkish\nevent coordinators, attendees kept\nending up with wounds across the hands\nand shins, despite a stringent register\nensuring that only BlindSoc members\nwere allowed in the room, and a recently\ndecommissioned metal detector from\nHeathrow at the door to check members\nfor weaponry. When the third session\nturned out just as bloody as the first two,\ncoordinators decided that foul play had to\nbe afoot in what might have been written\noff as incidents of spontaneous bleeding.\nInvestigations are limited mostly by\ngeopolitics. Due to the nocturnal habits\nof the porcupine, and the fact that\nBlindSoc members are, well, blind,\nstandard operating procedure dictates\nthat unnecessary lighting must be kept\noff at all times during the event to save\non energy bills which have exploded since\nPutin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Of course, this\nmeans observers cannot see what\u2019s going\non.\nThings reached a new nadir when Max\nOculus, a prospective BlindSoc member\nwho wasn\u2019t actually blind and was\ntherefore ineligible for membership, but\n\u201cwanted to see what all the tapping was\nabout\u201d, turned up to a session with a\nmocked up stick and black out glasses and\nactually left fully blind. As he was still\nwearing his shades when it happened, his\ntestimony of what went down was total\ngarbage.\nThis is your weekly reminder that the Catnip section of Felix is satire.

    "content": "The Exorcist, The Conjuring, The Omen, Rosemary\u2019s\nBaby, The Conjuring 2, The Nun. The horror genre\nis rife with Christian imagery and folklore. It\u2019s not surprising that a genre of films that aim to scare or unsettle us would draw largely on the stories and ideas that\nhavebeenusedtoscareusintopietyandrepentancefor\nhundredsofyears,orsubverttheassociatedmoralsthat\nform the foundation of our modern society. From the\nstart, horror drew directly on religious themes; Mary\nShelley\u2019s Frankenstein, a cautionary tale about man\u2019s\nhubris in attempting to create life, and the dangers of\nrationalism being divorced from a codified morality.\nBut there\u2019s an incredibly deep folklore that is rarely\ndepicted in modern film, which is that of Judaism, or\nmore specifically Kabbalism, which refers to old traditions of Jewish mysticism. Attachment takes the classic\nhorror staple of demonic possession and rehomes it in\nthis rich mythology.\nAttachment, or Natten Har \u00d8jne (The Night Has\nEyes), is an irreverent Danish horror rom-com directed by Gabriel Bier Gislason, his feature debut. The film\ndraws us in with a classic example of international girl\nmeets girl, as struggling Danish actor Maja (Josephine\nPark) bumps into British exchange student Leah (El-lie Kendrick) at a local library, who promptly drops\nan armful of books. A couple of days and drinks later,\nand Leah has effectively moved in. Not long after that,\na lovestruck Maja is accompanying Leah back to her\ntownhouse in Stamford Hill, an area of London home\nto Europe\u2019s largest Hasidic Jewish community, that she\nshares with her Danish - and quite orthodox - mother\n(Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l). Speaking at the London Film Festival,\nKendrick herself, who identifies as lesbian, emphasised this use of the now common cultural joke\nof the \u2018U-Haul lesbian\u2019. Altogether though,\nAttachment does a great job of not making a big deal out of its same-sex relationship \u2013 at least, as much as it can\nbe avoided in the Orthodox Jewish\nsetting.\nGislason (who is Jewish himself) admits\nthat he took\nsome creative license\nwith the depiction of the Hasidic community, focusing\non evoking a shared cultural experience that playfully\nleans on stereotypes rather than a fully accurate account of life in Stamford Hill. Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l is excellent\nin the role of the overbearing Jewish mother, for whom\n\u201ceverything is always a matter of life and death\u201d \u2013 al-though, in this film, it really is. As unique as the premise is, it\u2019s the cast that really brings this film to life. The\nchemistry \u2013 and tension \u2013 between the three women,\ncooped up in a small London town house, brilliantly\ncaptures the stark cultural contrasts. Themes\nlike that seem to come naturally to Gislason, who has spent time living in both\nCopenhagen and London. You can tell;\nwe experience life in Maja\u2019s shoes as she\nleaves her bright, modern Scandinavian apartment and finds herself in front\nof the kind of grey, Victorian terraced\nhouse that I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all very familiar with. The culture\nshock expertly\nembodied by the bewildered authenticity and Danish\nreticence that Josephine Park brings to a role that was,\nliterally, written for her.\nLove is the other central theme in Attachment. Both\nthe passionate and confusing love of a whirlwind rela-tionship, and the powerful and sometimes stifling love\nbetweenamotherandherdaughter.Intranslatingthose\nemotions to horror, and ideas of uncertainty and dis-trust, Attachment foregoes loud jump scares and harsh\ncuts in favour of a slow tension and a patient spooki-ness, and it does it very well. One of the few critiques\nthat I could offer of this film was that it could perhaps\nthrow itself a little deeper into the horror, especially\ntowards the third act, although that certainly isn\u2019t to\nsay that Attachment isn\u2019t plenty creepy. It\u00b4s equal-parts\nincredibly touching and nerve-wracking, and expertly\nbalances it\u2019s fusion of genres to generate a refreshing\nand memorable experience that is well worth a watch,\nif you can find somewhere to watch it.\nAttachment | Natten har \u00f8jne\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEdited by: Mike Buzadji\nJonah Hewett\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n18\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nFilm Editor Jonah Hewett presents a review of a Danish horror film from the BFI London Film Festival\nFilm Review\nCredit: NORDISK FILM\nWhat\u2019s on\nthis month\nThe French Film Festival comes to cinemas across the\nUK from 2 Nov to 15 Dec, featuring a stellar line-up of\npremieres at the Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re in South Kensington from\n2 to 13 November.

    "content": "FRIDAY 4TH NOVEMBER 2022\n5\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nLetter to the Editor\nDear Editor,\nI would like to share the story of how my partner and I escaped Russia.\nI was in line for passport control in February when I received a call. A panicked friend wondered whether I\u2019d seen Western news - the Russians are at the Ukrainian\nborder. This had been censored on Russian news, so I had no idea what he was on about. I told him I was leaving on holiday to the Maldives, and he begged me to\nflee Russia immediately.\nWe fell in love on the island of Ukulas. Though we needed separate beds, this American and his Russian exchanged hushed pillowtalk in the dark stillness of this\nsmall island in the middle of the sea after tranquil walks along the shore under the moonlight, while all America and Russia exchanged were harsh threats. These were\nour last normal days for a while.\nWe returned to Moscow on Valentine\u2019s Day. There was no time for the bittersweetness of returning from holiday - there was only a frenzy. The U.N. SecretaryGeneral spoke with the Security Council; America had evacuated her embassy staff from Ukraine. If Russia attacked Ukraine, the West would enact sanctions.\nCounter-sanctions from the Kremlin would make Americans like me persona non grata.\nIn five days I gathered five years of belongings, discarding a majority. My partner still had to work to sustain himself, and he was unable to relocate to a tolerant\ncountry. Due to the regime he opposes, of which he is a victim, he needs a visa to go to any gay-friendly country. We had to say goodbye.\nThe night before I left, we discussed touring places to figure out what we like. Next morning, we kissed farewell; he went to work; I rushed to the airport. Twelve\nhours after I landed in London, Russia invaded Ukraine. The ruble imploded. Flights sold out. Dystopian queues filled banks. A refugee crisis flooded across Europe.\nBaltic states closed their Russian borders. He could have been trapped at any moment. We decided that he should move out of Russia. He took a week off work and\nput in a tourist visa application to visit London to see if he liked it.\nNormally applications take three weeks, but to be safe he paid \u00a3250 for the priority service, which reduces the waiting time to five working days, or so the UKVI\nadvertises. We ended up waiting much longer.\nWhile he waited, he could do nothing. Friends were arrested for walking near protests. Russian news filled with stories of arrests made for social media posts. The\nday before the application was due to be decided, a rumour circulated that Russia would institute martial law, begin drafting, and prohibit young Russian men from\nexiting the country. He was only 26. The risk was real that he could be forced to choose between dying in somebody else\u2019s war and rotting in prison for draft dodging.\nHecouldn\u2019tgethispassportbackwithoutcancellinghisvisaapplication.Hehadan\u201cinternal\u201dpassportthatlethimtraveltoArmenia,Kazakhstan,andKyrgyzstan.\nIn London, my friends and I sat together frantically searching for tickets. The last flights to Armenia had already sold out. Finally, I spent nearly \u00a32000 to buy him the\nlast ticket to Kyrgyzstan. He exchanged everything he had at the airport. He flew a few minutes before midnight on the day the draft was rumoured to start.\nLifetherewasbleakasKyrgyzstanislessdeveloped.Thedayafterhelanded,MasterCardpulledoutofRussia,sohecouldn\u2019treceivemoney.Withouthisinternational\npassport he couldn\u2019t open accounts, and as a Russian he was banned from most fintech apps. Even with his cash it was hard to find a place. Accommodation was\nfilling up \u2014 with Russians. He wandered every few days to a new hotel. This continued for 20 days. Finally, the sixth bank he visited allowed him to get a card. Great\ntiming, as his cash had just finished.\nAfter 30 days foreigners must register, but he couldn\u2019t register without his international passport. Luckily, Kazakhstan had started accepting internal Russian\npassports again. However, due to COVID-19 the land border was closed, so he was forced to take a 30-minute flight into Kazakhstan. He found out only at the\nairport that he was required to have a PCR test, and I rushed to get him money onto his new card. He got his PCR 30 seconds before they closed the doors of his\nflight. He made it.\nIt had now been over 5 weeks since he applied for a visa. UKVI refused to indicate when it might be done. I decided to fly out of London into Kazakhstan: being\napart during such times was too difficult. We struggled to find accommodation as prices skyrocketed due to the influx of Russian escapees.\nWe waited a further 7 weeks, 13 weeks in total, for the visa. We waited two more for his mother to ship us his passport. After applying in February, we finally\nflew into London in July. While here, his mother told him that someone official, possibly military recruiters, came looking for him. When our friends heard, they\nproposed letting us stay here longer while we figure things out.\nWhile we were in London, Putin announced the mobilisation. This was the final straw. I took him to the Royal Albert Hall. I explained how my life really started\nwhen I graduated here. I proposed that this is a fitting location to set off \u2014 this time together. If he\u2019d like? He said yes!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Bradly Scott Kneisel, Imperial Alum\n\n"

Often,\nthis is out of a pure distraction caused\nby their own research that is responsible\nfor bringing funding to the college.\nSometimes, however, there might\nbe a handful of lecturers who really\nput their ideas to paper and try to\nmake the experience more enjoyable.\nOne of the newcomers in this field is\nnot actually a lecturer but actually a\nsociety, namely the college\u2019s Investment\nSociety. Given the STEM-dominated\nnature of the college, students like you\nand I often find it perversely difficult\nto understand anything that is going\non in the economy or in finance. What\ndoes it mean for the dollar to strengthen\nagainst the pound? Why is a tax cut\nnot going to be good for the economy\nin the light of inflation making our\nlives more challenging every day?\nThe Investment Society has spent\nthe last two years working on adapting\nits own lecture course, the Securities\nEducation Certificate (jokingly\nabbreviated to the American stock\npolice, the SEC) in a bid to level the\nplaying field against the Oxbridge, LSE,\nand UCL economists so that Imperial\nSTEM students, regardless of their\nfield of study, can develop an interest in\ninvestmentandfinancewiththepotential\nto develop a career in the industry.\nDeveloped by an ambitious group\nof lecturers led by one former Felix\ncolumn editor, Ahmad Danesh, they\nhave cracked not only a solution to the\nfinancial illiteracy that all students face\nacrosstheworld,buttheyhavealsofound\na way to engage the audience and make\nthe content so simple to understand, you\nwouldstruggletorememberatimewhen\na lecture was so easy to enjoy. When the\ncontent was so easy to grasp the first\ntime round that you would not need\nto Google a single concept because the\nlecturer made sure that they knew what\nyou would think and what you were\ngoing to ask in the back of your mind.\nI went to the lecture last week on\nmacroeconomics and foreign exchange\njusttoseewhatthehypereallywasabout.I\nhadheardthat650+studentshadsigned\nup (making it the biggest lecture course\non campus) but what was different was\nthe clarity and the entertaining nature\nof the lecturers themselves. Ahmad was\ndiscussing the idea of a basket of goods\nbeing used as a benchmark to calculate\nthe rate of inflation through something\ncalled the Consumer Price Index (the\nCPI). To illustrate the point, he brought\nan entire basket from Tesco\u2019s with bread,\ncereal, and milk inside it to showcase\nwhat the basket really meant\u2026 a basket!\nHe talked about the different currencies\nthat you could use to pay for the basket\nand even light-heartedly made a joke\nabout the Turkish Lira losing its value\nby more than half every day thanks to\nthe current rate of inflation exceeding\nwell above 100%, according to experts.\nAs with all lectures, it was not all\nperfect. Technical issues in Clore\nmeant there were delays thanks to the\nmicrophone and the speaker was rooted\nto the computer desk without being able\nto walk to the screen and point at graphs\nthat were visible on the screen. The\nmarket update delivered by an analyst\nin the Investment Society\u2019s capital fund,\nQT Capital, could have benefited from\nactual slides that I could take home and\nread in my own time. Although that\nis a very small point to make, since the\nupdates were so good that in the time\nthat Ahmad lectured about foreign\nexchange,theJapaneseCentralBankhad\nannounced an intervention, so I could\nimmediately apply what I had learned\nto an event that had not even happened\nbefore the start of the lecture. Clore was\nalso a stuffy lecture theatre and I did not\nappreciate the lack of air conditioning\n,butthelectureitselfwasquitefunoverall.\nI spoke to Ahmad at the end of the\nlecture since the other lecturer was away\nat another event entirely. He said that\nhis time as a Chemistry student really\nhelpedhimunderstandthingsbetterand\ndevelop an appreciation for how to learn\na difficult concept, which were ideas he\nbrought to this eight-year-old lecture\ncourse.Hedoessaythatwhileregistration\nto the SEC is now closed, he will be back\nwith the Imperial Blockchain Group to\nteach quantitative trading to all STEM\nstudentsfor12weeksfromJanuary2023.\nIf the SEC is anything to go by, it will\nbe exciting to see what Ahmad and the\nBlockchain Group do to revolutionise\nteaching even more next year!\nFRIDAY, 4TH NOVEMBER 2022\n7\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCan you teach STEM students\nabout finance in an interesting way?\nAnonymous\nCredit: Imperial College Investment Society\n\n"

She spoke\nalongside Dhara Vyas of Energy UK\nand Dean Russell MP, junior Minister\nat the Department for Business, Energy\nand Industrial Strategy, a role he began\nserving in days before the conference\nand ended on the 27th of October. The\ndiscussion focused on the importance of\napublic-privatepartnershipinachieving\na \u2018low-carbon future\u2019, consistent\ngovernment regulation, and consumer\nforces driving markets towards\nsustainability.\nMeanwhile, Dr Laure de Preux,\nfrom Imperial\u2019s Grantham Institute,\nspoke at the Labour Party conference\nin Liverpool. Dr de Preux was joined\nby Kerry McCarthy MP, the Shadow\nMinister for Climate Change, Darren\nJones MP, the Chair of the Business,\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy Select\nCommittee, and Professor Lorraine\nWhitmarshfromtheUniversityofBath.\nMost notably, all panellists seemed to\nagree that market forces would not be\nenough to reach a net-zero target by\n2050.

On the one\nhand, the Transition to Zero Pollution\nInitiative is relatively new. Launched\nin 2020, its goal is to bring together\nresearchers from across the college to\nfind solutions to all types of pollution,\nnot just carbon emissions. The\nTransition to Zero Pollution initiative is\npart of the College\u2019s Academic Strategy,\npublished in 2020. Among other\nthings, their research focuses on climate\nresilience, sustainable resources, and\nurban ecosystems.\nThe Grantham Institute, formed in\n2007, has the clearly stated goal of a\n\u2018zero-carbon society.\u2019 Considering the\nsmall, but important difference between\nthe Conservative\u2019s goal of \u2018low-carbon\u2019\nandLabour\u2019s\u2018zero-carbon\u2019goal,itmakes\nsense that the Grantham Institute,\nexplicitly seeking a zero-carbon future,\nworks with Labour. Beyond that\ngoal, the Institute aims to promote\ninterdisciplinary solutions to climate\nissues in the UK and internationally.\nTheir focus is much wider, going beyond\nclimate change mitigation to the\neconomic and health effects of climate\nchange and its mitigation.\nIn sending different researchers from\ndifferent research groups to different\npartyconferences,Imperialmakesitclear\ntheir focus is on providing policymakers\nwith research and advice to mitigate\nthe effects of climate change, regardless\nof party affiliation.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nHow to live without red blood cells\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nAll vertebrates need red blood cells\nto live - except the icefish, which\nlacks these cells as well as haemoglobin.\nLiving on the floor of the cold oceans\nsurrounding Antarctica, the icefish accounts for 90% of the fish biomass of\nits habitat. Though the water\u2019s freezing\npointislowerduetothepresenceofsalts\nwithin, the water temperature still has a\nharsh range of 1.5\u00baC in the summer to\n-1.8\u00baC during the winter. Surprisingly,\nhowever, the icefish\u2019s lack of red blood\ncells and the harsh conditions of its environment are a perfect match.\nThe absence of red blood cells\ngreatly reduces the icefish\u2019s capability\nto transport oxygen throughout its\nbody, causing it to carry around 47%\nless oxygen in its blood than other fish.\nThis would be a massive disadvantage\nif we did not take into account the type\nof environments the icefish lives in. In\nsuch low temperatures, blood tends\nto solidify and become thicker and\nharder for the heart to pump, thus being\ncounterproductive for survival. Though\ndeleterious at first glance, the loss of red\nblood cells turns out to be advantageous\nfor the icefish in its environment.\nOxygen also dissolves better in colder\nwaterbecausethekineticenergyofwater\nmolecules is lower, causing them to bind\nmore tightly and trap\noxygen better. This\nleads to oxygen\nconcentration being\nhigher in oceans\naround Antarctica\nthan in temperate\noceans, allowing the\nicefish to partially\ncompensate for its\nlack of red blood\ncells. In addition,\nthe icefish has bigger\ngills as well as thick\nscalelessskinthatcan\nfacilitate the direct\nexchange of gases between its body and\nthe surrounding environment.\nThe icefish can also compensate for\ndecreased oxygen delivery with a more\npowerfulandefficientcirculatorysystem.\nThe icefish has larger hearts and blood\nvessels than fish from temperate waters,\nso it can transport more blood and thus\nmore oxygen. Additionally, a significant\nportion of the icefish\u2019s energy is spent\npowering its circulatory system\u201422%\nto be exact. In comparison, fish from\ntemperate waters and\nhumans spend only\naround 5%.\nNormally, if a\nvertebrate animal\nis frozen, it can\nhardly return to\nlife because the ice\ncrystals formed\nduring frostbite are\nsharp and will break\ncellular structures.\nHowever, the icefish\nhas antifreeze\nproteins that prevent\nthe formation of ice\ncrystals in their bodies. These special\nproteins bind to forming ice crystals,\ninhibiting the further binding of water\nmolecules to these crystals and stopping\ntheir growth. Antifreeze proteins\ndecreasethefreezingpointoftheicefish\u2019s\nbody fluids to\n-2.5\u00baC.Thisis0.5\u00baC\nbelow the freezing\npoint of seawater, a\nsmall temperature\ndifference which\nin harsh situations\nseparates life and\ndeath. Though the\nantifreeze system\nof the icefish is not\nperfect and the\nicefish still has some\ntinyicecrystalsinits\nbody, it surprisingly\ncan continue\nliving despite\nthat. Scientists\nare researching\nthis incredible\np h e n o m e n o n\nas it breaks the\nassumption that\nvertebrates cannot survive with ice\ncrystals in their bodies. Finding out\nthe mechanisms behind this occurence\nmight also have huge implications\nfor the development of better cryo-preservation techniques.\nWhy would the icefish like to live in\nsuch extreme environments where most\nother fish would simply perish? Due to\nthe absence of competition, the waters\nare richer in plankton and krill, which\nthe icefish feed on. In addition, the\nicefish lacks many predators simply by\nliving in such environments where their\npotential predators cannot. This allows\nthe icefish to focus most of its energy\ntowards adapting to the environment\nrather than competing with other living\nbeings.\nAs red blood cells increase the\namount of oxygen transported, they are\nevolutionarily advantageous in almost\nall vertebrates, except the icefish because\nadaptations are context dependent.\nThe icefish is a marvellous example of\nthe idea that there is no such thing as a\nuniversal statement in nature.\nStaff Writer Wang Guo on the curious physiology of icefish\nThe mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus\ngunnari) on a 1978 Soviet postage stamp\nCredit: Ministry of Communications of the USSR\nEdited by: Jamie John\nangie lo\nScience\nIcefish larva\nCredit: Uwe kils, Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0\nTHE ICEFISH'S\nLACK OF RED\nBLOOD CELLS\nAND ITS HARSH\nENVIRONMENT\nARE A PERFECT\nMATCH\n\u201c\n\n"

What sets Frankie\nStew and Harvey Gunn apart from other artists is\ntheir openness to contemplate the questions and fears\npeople tend to keep for themselves. It is rare to secure\na connection of such a level but the artists feel secure\nenough to uncover their deepest secrets. With every\ntrack detailing its own struggle, you can\u2019t help but feel\nhow delicate this album really is.\nThe third song on the album, \u2018Let the Light In\u2019, is a\ndeep-cutting, vulnerable track where Frankie bravely\nunravels and lets listeners into his mind. Frankie has\nbeen praised in the past for his brutally honest and raw\nintrospective lyricism and he delivers again, creating\ntheir most profound song to date. You can feel the\npain in his voice as Frankie raps about the feeling of\ndealing with mental health whilst suffering in silence,\nsomething that may well be more familiar than ever\nbefore for most of us. However, in articulating these\ncommon anxieties with his signature nonchalant vocal\ndelivery,Frankiemanagestorestoreasenseofcalmand\nhope, letting a tiny bit of light glimmer throughout the\nsong.\nIn \u2018Fatboy\u2019s Cafe\u2019, a tribute to the boys\u2019 hometown,\nFrankie\u2019s lyrics give us a masterclass on how to hit\nstraight to the heart and make us think and feel. His\nlyrics touch on childhood nostalgia and an ever-changing sense of home, but overall he translates a\nsense of immense gratitude for his roots.
