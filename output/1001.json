    "content": "22 Opinion\nEditorial\nFirstly, I guess I ought to explain what happened\nlast week. We had planned to bring out a Felix\nsimilar to this one with all the regular articles to\naccompany the special 1000th edition.\nUnfortunately, the litho (the machine which\nprints Felix) broke down. We'd printed about a third of the magazine, but there was no way that\nthe litho could have been repaired in time to\nfinish it. We decided that the best option was to\ncarry all the articles forward and include them in\nthis issue. Apologies to anyone inconvenienced\nby this.\nSimon Baker really does seem to have a bee in\nhis bonnet about the state of Felix at the\nmoment. To be honest, I really don't have the\ninclination to reply. I 'll just be saying the same\nthings over and over again. One thing I will say\nis in defence of the comments about the features.\nEvery single feature isn't supposed to be\ninteresting to every single person. I don't think\nyou have to be an avid crossword er to read an\narticle about a crossword competition. Would\nyou need to have been on holiday to Malaysia to\nread the article about it in this issue? I don't think so. The articles are written to inform\npeople about something they maybe don't already know. If you aren't interested, then you\ndon't have to read them.\nAnyway, why has it taken Mr Baker so long\nto put pen to paper and complain. He's put up\nwith Felix for two terms (over 20 issues) without\nbothering to say anything. Now, all of a sudden,\nhe is demanding changes. This is the hardest\ntime to change things with everyone in the\nmiddle of exams.\nAs for the letter he supposedly submitted for\nissue 998, I have no recollection of it. It\ncertainly would not have been withheld just\nbecause it wasn't on a disk. What I want to\nknow is where are the 5,000 copies of the letter\nand the box of pr it t sticks which Mr Baker\npromised would accompany his next letter?\nWhy is it that the College can see fit to invest\n\u00a360,000 in refurbishing the Huxley foyer for a royal visit, when the money could easily have\nbeen used to do something towards upgrading\nstudent accommodation. I'm sure the money\ncould have been invested in making improve-ment s. Ask anyone who lives in a hall of\nresidence and they'll be able to rattle off a great\nlong list of things that need changing. I know\nthat a common complaint is a lack of space in\nfridges and freezers. How many fridges could\nyou buy with \u00a360,000? What about the lack of\ncommon room facilities in the Evelyn Gardens\nhalls? Couldn't the money could have been put\ntowards doing something about that? Maybe\nsomeone should invite someone from the Royal\nFamily to look round the halls of residence. It\nseems to be the only way to get any\nimprovements done.\nWith this new-style Huxley foyer it seems\nthat the table which used to sit in front of the\npillar is deemed too unsightly to be put back.\nThe leaves us with a bit of a problem with where\nto leave the copies of Felix on a Friday morning.\nLast week we were told that we couldn't leave\nthem anywhere in the nice new foyer. It seems\nto be the most sensible place as a lot of people\nuse that entrance for maths, physics and\ncomputing. It's not as if the copies stay there\nvery long anyway; most of them are gone by\nabout 11 o 'clock. If anyone's got any suggestions of a suitable place to leave them, I'd love\nto know.\nAnswers to the last\nElimination\na Food, Smoker 11,33\nb Spanish Fly 35,1\nc Jet, Death 2,24\nd Past Tense 14, 30\ne Navy, Whale 13,31\nf High Five 12,9\ng Fingers, Village 34, 37\nh Short Term 28, 16\ni Plate, Cardinal 26, 39\nj Flag Down 10,7\nk Break, Intermission 19,41\n1 Drop Dead 8,6\nm Wear, Where 17, 32\nn Work Out 18,3\n0 Cares, Races 20,27\nP Piggy-Bank 25,5\nq Tit, Peep 4,15\nr Suicide, Creed 36,22\ns Cross Check 23, 21\nt Synod, Assembly 29, 38\nThe word left over was Messages\nFree Speech\nDear Beccy,\nIt has been implied by several\ncorrespondents in the last two issues of Felix\n(998/999) that I am a bigot who is incapable of\naccepting a multi-cultural society.

    "content": "10 Feature / Clubs & Societies\nDeclaration of the Bab STOIC\nOn Monday 23rd May 1994 over 6 million\nBaha'is across the world celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of the Bab. The\nBab was a young Persian man from the city of\nShiraz in Iran and He declared to be the\nforerunner of One who was expected by all\nmajor world religions. His progressive teachings\ncaused a lot of uprisings in Persia which\neventually lead to His martyrdom in 1850 along\nwith many of His growing band of followers.\nIn 1863, Baha'u 'llah publicly declared that\nHe was the Promised One of all Ages, foretold\nby the Bab. This was a title in Arabic which\nmeans The Glory of God'. He indicated that\nHis Teachings were but the latest chapter of\nGod's unfolding message for mankind and that\nit complemented that of previous prophets of\nGod such as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha\nand Krishna. He stressed that the time had come\nto pursue the common goal of unifying mankind.\nHis adherents are called Baha'is and are\nmembers of the Baha'i Faith. The government\nand clergy in Persia opposed Baha'u 'llah's rising influence and fame. Consequently, He\nwas banished throughout the Turkish Empire\nover the following 40 years until He passed\naway, near the city of Akka, in 1892. It is\nrecounted in many historical documents that\nover 20,000 of the Bab's followers were\nmartyred and later many of Baha'u 'llah's followers suffered the same fate.\nDespite the fact that the Baha'i Faith is only\n150 years old, according to the Encyclopedia\nBritannica it is the second most widespread\nreligion in the world after Christianity. Baha'is\nexist in 220 countries and territories of the world\nand come from all ethnic, religious and cultural\nbackgrounds.\nThe Baha'i faith teaches the existence of one\nGod, unknowable in His essence. In\nBaha'u 'llah's writings, He explains that religion\nis revealed to mankind progressively, in\nproportion to society's maturity and capacity\nand that today the most pressing need is the\nprinciple of the oneness of mankind. All people,\nregardless of their race, colour, or religion\nbelong to the same human family. He said: \"The\nearth is but one country and mankind its\ncitizens.\"\nIn addition, there are many social teachings\nassociated with His Revelation. Some Baha'i principles include the equality of men and\nwomen, the abolition of all forms of prejudice,\nthe independent investigation of the truth and\nthe harmony between science and religion.\nCurrently, there is no single Baha'i leader. In\nfact the Baha'i Faith has no clergy. However, it\ndoes have governing bodies on local, national\nand international levels elected through secret\nballot. The international governing body of the\nBaha'i Faith, the Universal House of Justice, is\nbased in Haifa, Israel at a short distance from the\nresting place of the Bab.\nVarqaKhadem\nLast weekend, the STOIC network was\nextended to near its former glory days. A test\ncard was transmitted to Linstead Hall along with\nthe sound from MTV. This means that STOIC will soon be on air to\nall the Southside halls. Due to numerous cable,\nvideo and satellite channels in the halls, STOIC\nis tuning the system to avoid interference.\nA generous gift from London Weekend\nTelevision means that STOIC now has suitable\ntest and measuring equipment to work with.\nIf you are interested in helping, please ring\nus on our new numbers: 48104 or 071 594 8104.\nVictory\nImperial College claimed a double victory at the\nChiswick Regatta last weekend, the latest in a long line of Boat Club successes.\nThis time it was the turn of the women's crews for glory, beating the University College\nHospital crew by seven lengths in the final of\nthe Novice Coxed Four category. The same\ncrew, with one substitution, claimed another win\nover Thames Tradesmen Rowing Club by one\nlength in the Senior Three Coxed Fours.\nThese are the first wins of the summer for IC\nBoat Club and undoubtedly the first of many.\n2 Exhibition Doad\nLondon SW7\nTelephone 071589 8947\nHappy Hour\n6 - 7pm, Mon - Fri\nEnjoy a free glass of wine or beer on\nyour first visit to your nearest and nicest local restaurant!

    "content": "2 News\nRoyal Visits to Imperial College\nComputing student Rafal Lukawiecki discusses his work with Princess Anne\nBY PATRICK WOOD\nThe Princess Royal, Chancellor of\nthe University of London, opened\nthe Imperial College/Fujitsu\nParallel Computing Research\nCentre in the Huxley Building on\nTuesday 24th May.\nThe Japanese electronics giant\nFujitsu, in its first such collaboration with an academic institution,\nhas donated an AP1000 parallel\nmachine to the College. The\nAPI 000, located in the Department\nof Computing, is available to\nresearch groups throughout Europe\nvia the SuperJANET network.\nAccess will be free to registered\nusers, who will share all software\ndeveloped on the machine. Areas of\nresearch in which the API000 is\nalready being used include chaos,\nvirtual reality and artificial life\nsimulation. The new machine is\nalso available for use in relevant\nundergraduate projects.\nThe Princess Royal was shown\nthe API000 in operation and then\nunveiled a commemorative plaque\nin the newly refurbished foyer of\nthe Huxley Building. Some have\ncriticised the \u00a360,000 refurbishment\nas a cosmetic exercise. Professor\nJohn Darlington, Director of the\nCentre, defended the decision. \"It\nwas pretty dowdy...a depressing\nplace to enter,\" he said. \"You've\ngot to refurbish the infrastructure\nsooner or later and it does lift the\nmorale of people working here.\"\nA second royal visit took place\ntwo days later. Prince Andrew\nattended one of the talks given in\nthe Huxley Building as part of the\nseminar 'Is Life Becoming Hard?'.\nThe lectures dealt with topics\ncommon to both the physical and\nbiological sciences, such as neural\nnetworks. The seminar, jointly\nsponsored by Imperial College and\nSEM A Group pic, was one of the\nevents taking place to celebrate the\n200th anniversary of the Ecole\nPolytechnique in Paris.\nDrop In University Funding\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nUniversity funding has been slashed\nby 25% per student over the past\nfour years, according to a report\nfrom the Committee of ViceChancellors and Principals (CVCP).\nThe report, published on 20th May, warned that standards of\nteaching were bound to be affected\nby this reduction in funding per\nstudent. They also forecast that\nfunding will fall by a further 14%\nover the next three years. The\nauthors feel that the resultant short-fall, estimated at around \u00a32 billion,\n\"has already impaired the quality of\nthe student experience because of\nlarger teaching groups...[and] less\nspent on library books\".\nThe CVC P want to enter into\ndiscussions with the Government\nabout a new funding system able to\ndeliver both expansion and quality\nin higher education. CVC P Chairman, Dr Kenneth Edwards,\nsaid: \"To invest in universities is to\ninvest in the future...demand for\nuniversity education and research is\nrising fast and will not abate. The\nGovernment should recognise that\nthe universities are one of the UK' s success stories. How long will the\nGovernment continue to risk the\nquality which underlies that\nsuccess?\"\nIn the past ten years, the proportion of school-leave rs going to\nuniversity has risen from one in\nfive to almost one in three, but\nGovernment funding has not kept\nup pace with this growth.\nFirst Year\nStudent\nExpelled\nBY SIMON SHAW\nA Physics student has been\nexpelled from Imperial College\nafter breaching the conditions\nunder which he was temporarily\nsuspended.\nRonnie Wong, a first year\nPhysics undergraduate, was suspended from College for harassing\na female student {Felix 996). He\nhad anonymously sent the woman\nmessages by handwritten notes and\nelectronic mail for more than two\nmonths before he was identified. A College disciplinary hearing on\n29th March suspended Mr Wong\nuntil the next academic year and\nbanned him from his victim's hall\nof residence.\nJust over a month later, Mr Wong was spotted in the woman's hall of residence by three students\nwho alerted College Security. A second College disciplinary hearing\nwas held on 16th May at which it\nwas decided to expel him. Mr Wong appealed to the Rector, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, but the decision\nof the hearing was upheld.\nCollege Security have put up\nwarning posters around College\nbearing a photograph of Mr Wong.\nIf he is sighted in College,\nSherfield Security should be\nnotified directly on extension 3372.\nRecord\nBreaker\nThe world record for the furthest\ndistance flown by a paper aeroplane\nwas broken at the International\nPaper Plane Tournament on\nSaturday 19th May.\nFlight Refuelling Ltd broke the\nrecord with a flight of 203ft4 in. Imperial College's team came 9th in the competition, with a flight\ndistance of 86ft4 in. The team from the Aeronautics\ndepartment were: Martin Ng, Anand Mantri and Manish Sinha.\nThe team also had lecturer Dr\nMorrison advising.\nWhat's it like to spend a holiday in Malaysia?

    "content": "20\n1 -mm j Sheep\nby Simon Maginn\nReviews\nStrip Tease\nby Carl Hiaasen\nThis is Simon Maginn's first novel and it shows\ngreat promise. Sheep is a graphically horrific\ntale story about an enterprising builder, James, a promising artist, Adele, and their seven year old\nson, Sam. Soon after a tragic holiday accident in\nwhich their daughter drowns, James is\ncommissioned to repair an ancient, farmhouse\nwhich lies near the cliffs in west Wales. They\nmove into it, in the hope that a change of\nscenery will help them come to terms with the\nloss of their child.\nShortly after they move into the farmhouse,\nAdele's paintings become more macabre and\nJames uncovers some strange bones whilst\ndigging in the garden during the course of the\nrenovations. The neighbours slowly tell them\nwhat they know about the previous occupants of\nthe house; of drug-crazed parties, murder and\nincarceration. Then Sam has a fit and sees\nsomething that links the past and present in a shocking way.\nI liked it. The story is written in a lazy style\nwhich fools the reader into becoming\ncomplacent and is entwined with descriptive and\ngraphic accounts of slaughter and decay. It\nworks well, drawing you to the characters and\nmaking you experience the horror, pain and fear\nthat they go through when the chilling truth is\nrevealed. The climax is startling and yet\nmagnificently glorified. If Sheep is an example\nof the books to follow, Simon Maginn should\nsoon be a best-seller.\nIanT\nPublished by: Corgi\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nPeople who think feminism is redundant should\nopen their eyes and then read Strip Tease. It\nfollows Erin, who is 'stripping to fight a child\ncustody case', through a series of death defying ly stereotypical encounters which ultimately leave\na sour, acidic taste in the mouth.\nThe whole feel is similar to those old sex\npulp novels: 'She looked at the eyes of her\nfathers old and ugly friends, their lust full glances and her own lush beauty. She would do\nanything to get out, anything.' Get dressed and\nget a job perhaps?.\nI'd love to give away the plot to 'wreck' the\nbook but, alas, Hiaasen has neglected to provide\none. Basically, Erin and her friends discuss the\nproblems of bouncing cleavage when dancing,\ndecide that they have no choice but to wrestle in\nvegetable oil for twenty quid and are lusted after\nby every male in the book. This kind of rubbish\ndoes neither men nor women any good. If you\nwant to read about sex read Henry Miller's once\nbanned Tropic of Cancer which is blunt, brutal,\nmisogynist and honest. Hiaasen can't get away\nwith Ice Cream Girl, so he makes Erin a noble,\nv irt u osu new-woman struggling to cope with\nnaughty, lustful men by becoming a sex object.\nThe final insult is when Erin decides that\nenough is enough and so lures her enemy (and\nthe FBI) into the middle of a field to falsely 'cry\nrape'; the old male fear and the most dangerous\nmyth to stick into this trash. I notice I have\nfailed to make clear that Strip Tease is marketed\nas a light hearted comedy thriller. Some people\nneed to be shown why feminism is still a verb.\nOwain\nPublished by: Macmillan\nPrice: \u00a314.99 (Hardback)\nThe City\nJames Herbert\nIllustrated by Ian Miller\nFirst things first. This is not a book that is going\nto tax you or make you think. In fact, it would\nbe possible to read this book whilst attempting\nto write a Gaussian elimination program in\nPascal, talking to a few friends and playing\ncomputer games simultaneously. If you wanted\nto sit down and read it from start to finish then it\nwould take you approximately fifteen minutes,\ngenerously allowing time to make a cup of tea\nin there somewhere. However, it is not possible\nto 'read' it as there are roughly three phrases for\nevery eight pictures, of which one might be a spoken word.\nMost people have heard of the adage: 'A picture tells a thousand words'. In this book, the\npictures need to. Luckily, the pictures are of a reasonable quality and give the book some\ncredibility. Unfortunately, when the pictures are\nweighed against B movie speech such as,\n\"Roast in Hell, you sick obscenity\" there is no\nmatch.\nNow, onto the story line. A warrior-type hero\nfigure goes into a city which rats now dominate\nwith lots of big guns and weapons to find his\nprevious girlfriend/wife/mistress (the book\ndidn't say much about anything). That was the\nstoryline. The ending is as startling as accidently\nbrushing against a weak, battery powered\nelectric fence and the plot is not original. For\n\u00a38.99, you have to really like the pictures to buy\nit - but why buy it when you can read it in the\nshop anyway.\nIanT\nPublished by: Pan Books\nPrice: \u00a38.99\nWouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now\nby Maya Angelou\nI knew Maya Angelou as a poet who wrote\n'Come. And Be My Baby', one of the poems on\nthe underground. Of course she's far more than a poet, not least being an important figure in black\nwomen's literature and even having the dubious\npleasure of writing President Clinton's inaugural\npoem.\nHer new book is a small collection of short\nessays - autobiographical, honest, proud in the\nface of mounting odds and occasionally cloying\nin moralistic tone. Sometimes this can be quite\ninfuriating, even though you think she may be\nright. Yet Maya does bare her teeth, too. The\npublic crudeness of entertainers is linked to the\ncorporate indulgence of the Romans at the\nColosseum in the chapter headed 'Brutality Is\nDefinitely Not Acceptable'. Here, she is harsh in\nher condemnation, but the whole is so strict.\nMost of the figures who live between her\npages play out little pieces of life, the classic one\nbeing 'New Directions' where a single mother\nmakes a future for herself and her children with\ndetermination and acumen. So we all travel the\nroad of life, taking what directions seem best.\nThe least travelled path is not valid in itself, but\nonly if we choose to follow it. I guess that\ncontentment is to be happy with what you've got.\nIf Maya Angelou gently reminds us that we\nare not all we should be, maybe she is telling us\nwe need to lose some baggage so that our\njourney will be smoother and the final\ndestination sweeter.\nTintin\nPublished by: Virago\nPrice: \u00a39.99 (Hardback)\nLook Who's Talking Now! is reviewed on page 19\n\n"

(This\noffer is not available for tickets bought from the\nUnion Office.)\nLook out for the posters, adverts in Felix or\ntelephone ext 3527 for further details.\nOver the weekend, 7th and 8th May, the Boat\nClub competed at Ghent International Regatta in\nBelgium. Many top British and European clubs\nwere in attendance, including the University of\nLondon, the Great Britain lu nior Squad, the\nBelgian National Squad, and several Dutch and\nFrench top clubs. In addition to these were the\nSouth African, Argentinian, and Chilean\nnational teams. This ensured that the racing was\nof the highest standard; frequently the open titles\nwinner's were of Olympic final class, indeed the\nBelgian cox less pair came fourth at last year's World Championships.\nIC Boat Club, arriving in the midst of finals,\nquickly found their feet and acquitted\nthemselves admirably with four titles from the\nweekend, significantly out-performing all other\ndomestic clubs.\nOn the Saturday, the 1st VII, racing in small\nboats, showed their ability to stay with the top-class crews when they narrowly failed to have\ntwo pairs, from three, in the five boat final,\ndespite recording the second and third fastest\ntimes in their tough heats. However, the hastily-thrown together combination of Ben Poulton and\nLuka Grubor showed true grit and overcame\nexam-induced fatigue to finish second, very\nclose behind a Dutch national pair.\nIn another tough heat, the top men's cox less four were nudged out of the final by the Belgian\nand South African fours, whilst the second four\nwere slightly further down. Dan Forster, in a single scull, failed to make the final in a very\nhigh-class event.\nIn the eights, IC women, troubled with\ninjury, continued their run of success with a comfortable win over their school-girl\nopponents in a two-boat final. In contrast, the\nyoung and inexperienced men's second eight\nhad a 'baptism of fire' final, pitched against the\nSouth Africans, Belgians, and a strong Dutch\nstudent crew from Amsterdam. In a close battle\nbetween all four crews, the IC boys missed the\nbronze by a whisker, whilst still overlapping the\nwinner.\nSunday saw a bit more luck on IC's side with\nthe second men's cox less four recovering from a poor race the previous day to dominate the final\nof under-23 fours and to walk off with an\nimpressive trophy. Again the top men's four\nencountered their bogey-crews in the form of the\nSouth Africans and the Belgians in their heat\nand yet again failed to qualify for the final.\nIn the under-23 pairs, Martin Kettle and Ace\nGreen made up for missing Saturday's final by\ncruising home well ahead of the cosmopolitan\nfield in a very quick time. The women's eight, in\ntheir straight final, could not match the crisp\nblade work of a Thames Tradesmen crew, who\ndominated the race from the outset, leaving the\ngirls in their wash. The men's eight enjoyed the\nfeel of controlling their final race from start to\nfinish, boosting their morale.\nAfter an exhausting weekend, IC showed\ngreat promise for the summer regatta season.\nVarious crews will be competing at these top\ndomestic events as well as major international\nones such as Duisberg and Paris in the near\nfuture, before descending on Henley in lu ly. Zimbabwe\nTour For\nIC Rugby\nFor the first time in the history of Imperial\nCollege sport a tour is being organised to\nZimbabwe. IC Rugby Football Club 1st XV will\nleave on the 26th June to spend two weeks\nplaying various clubs and regional sides around\nHarare, including Zimbabwe University 1st XV, returning on 10th July.\nAs well as playing rugby and strengthening\nlinks with the University of Zimbabwe, we hope\nto meet up with 75 IC alumni who now live out\nthere, with the aim of organising a reception or\ndinner which would take place during our stay\nin Zimbabwe.\nThe squad will consist of about 18 players,\nwho have all played for Imperial College this\nyear. The responsibility for the selection of this\nsquad will rest with next season's Captain, Tim\nTownend (Mech Eng 1) and Andrew\nMontgomery, ICRFC Honorary Secretary and\nACC Chairman.\nFor most of the players in the squad, this will\nbe their first trip to Africa and so they will be\nlooking forward to seeing and experiencing a very different country and culture at first hand.\nIf anyone has any reliable contacts in or\naround Harare, who would be able to provide\ntwo or three players with accommodation or\ncould possibly help with any other aspect of the\ntour please contact Matt Anstead (Mech Eng 1),\ntel 071 727 6031 (late or early).\nThe ENO's Peter Grimes is reviewed on page 14\n\n"

God draw on a true\nvariety of influences: the rigidly structured\nclang of industrial music, the mindless scream\nof thrash metal, the sprawling repetition of\nambient house and, most notably, the melodic\ninstrumental freedom of jazz. Indeed, the lineup of the group is impressively varied with\nsaxophones, double bass and even a viola\naugmenting the usual two guitars, bass and\ndrums. They slip easily from crunchy metal\nriffing through complex percussive rhythms to\nsquiggling free jazz saxophones/feedback\nexcursions and back again, but never do the\nseams become intrusive. This music is at once\nbrutal and atonal yet subtle, complex,\naccessible and melodic. The best moments are\nbreathtaking in their spiky beauty, while the\nworst occur when the guitars outweigh\neverything else, resulting in a new, improved\nform of death-metal drudgery.\nIn a world of retro-rock, God are very special.\nPost-modernism was never this fresh. (9) Guy\niMf ow m Nova Mob\nNova Mob\nFirst, I admit that I know Grant Hart as not Bob\nMould from Hiisker Dti; but, after all, it's only\npost Sugar that they weren't both simply\nHiiskerites. Grant's released a solo album and\nthis is the Mob's second, but I'm going to\ncompare him to Minneapolis' Heroes. It's Frank Black\nTeenager Of The Year\n\"Now virtually everyone's singing a popular\nsong, but I still believe in the excellent joys of\npunk\" was what I heard, first minute, first track.\nFunny how you get things wrong. But attention\nto detail is a Frank Black trademark. Sadly for\nthe retro jaded greasers of the NME 'revival', Mr\nBlack is still playing his own game and I just\nmis heard. Yeah well, anyone could mistake\n'punk' for 'pong'. Frank remains on another\nlevel from the mortals below the majestic sweep\nof his fever ing imagination.\nI bore you with my mistakes because this\nalbum is choked full of all the musical double\nentendres from a career is t who has matured into\nan art form. He spends our time trying to\npersuade us that he can really tell one end of a joke from a serious idea, whilst remaining\nperilously close to them both. Teenager of the\nyear or a more elderly, rather rotund figure\ncurrently modelling a white boiler suit? And\nthat's just the album's title. One step back and\none step forward, getting nowhere, still in motion.\n'Whatever Happened to Pong?' takes the\nintro-page from 'Bossonova' before skidding\nfirmly away with a burst of shiny harmonica into\nsolo territory. It's a harbinger of what's to come\non the remaining 21 shots which make up this\ndouble album. Whereas most people crumple\nunder the freedom offered by that format,\nespecially outside the confines of a live or\ngreatest hits cobble-together, Frank just strides\naround in all directions (at once). Yet for all his\nbustle, these are well worn tracks.\nThe technocrat ic shimmer emitted by\n'Abstract Plain', the hinting of 'Fazer Eyes' and\nthe fully wired up circuit boards of 'White Noise\nMaker' have always been obvious in his work.\nClever word plays like 'Calistan' and\n'Thalassocracy' are evidence of intelligence\nrattling round inside a corny synthetic fur-lined\nskull. (The latter incidentally being invented\nfrom the root 'thal as sic' of seas, esp. small or\ninland.) And the sheer straight down the\nhighway laughing grace of 'Speedy Marie' and\n'Pure Denizens of the Citizens Band' show that\neven rock clich es can swing in Frank's pants.\nsummer and the tatty charade is falling down...\nWe start with the vibrant 'Old Empire'.\nSurging Sugar style joy gives way to the\ndubiously titled 'Shoot Your Way To Freedom'.\nDrugs, guns, metaphysical seizing of the day,\nwho knows? The second excellent song is 'Little\nMiss Information' which has Grant at his\npunning best. He un shockingly now plays guitar,\nbassist Tom plays melodic lines, the lead plays\nguitar solos and the drummer loves his cymbals\nas someone in a band with a grunge-drum-A boy worried about his growing acne problem\nand failure to get a girlfriend ?\nPost-angst spread never sounded so young.\nThat he fetches and doppelg a ngs unintentionally between the weirdest collection\nof groups is another turn-up from a man who has\nlaunched more than his share of youthful guitar\nbased ambition. 'Abstract Plain' follows\nNirvana, 'Thalassocracy' is more than a bit of\nthe Dead Kennedys, 'Superabound' comes with\nstreaks of Dylan and if 'The Vanishing Spires'\ndoesn't bring back the late night creepy groove\nof Serge Gainsbourgh's 'Je t 'aime moi non plus'\nthen Charlotte G had a stable childhood.\nStill like Andy Warhol's repetition of\nmultifarious screen prints which made art out of\nthe ordinary, the way Frank Black makes off fast\nwith our commonsense is all his own. Before too\nlong it's hard to believe I ever had any. The little\npeople at the bottom of the garden agree. (8)\nTintin\ngodfather should. He slows down for 'Puzzles',\na lyrical lament, it is the first track to fall to the\nalbum's wayward charm.\nThis album just isn't remarkable. The songs\nturn irritating as quickly as they hook you in. At\nleast, the best live band of the year needs you to\nturn the volume up. It sounds like a transistor\nradio and reminds me of Bon Jovi. It's late May\nand I want Don and 'The Boys of Summer'. Just\nbecause you're a legend doesn't let you get away\nwith music any less special. (6) Owain\nYou won't be frightened of the real thing after the show\n\n"

    "content": "College Concerts 15\nSpirit Of The Psalms\nIC Choir's line-up for last term's Verdi Requiem (Photo: Neville Miles)\nAround 250 people gathered in the Great Hall\nlast Friday evening to hear this term's performance by the College Choir. The summer\nterm's concerts seem to have a habit of being\nunder attended as compared with the other terms'\n(last term the hall was full to its 600 capacity) -and I don't believe everybody was hard at work\nrevising all evening! On the other hand the Choir\nwas also somewhat smaller than usual (even for\na summer term), with only 65 singers on the\nplatform. Their orchestra was also smaller than\nnormal, which at least gave the choir some\nchance of being heard!\nThe first item on the menu was Blow's Awake, awake my lyre. Almost everything from\nthis period seems to work well only with the\ncomparatively small forces that are now the\nnorm for their performance, and although the\nChoir was smaller than its usual size, it still felt\ntoo much for this particular piece. In addition,\nthey seemed to have only just learned the notes\nin time and hence not concentrated sufficiently\non feeling the music and understanding what had\nto be communicated to the audience. Eric\nBrown, the Choir's musical director, had elected\nto use a tenor soloist (the score leaves the voice\npart of the soloist to the performers' discretion),\nbut Philip Dennis's sound, with its\noverenthusiastic vibrato, really didn't fit in with\nthe very pure, young sound of the Choir.\nIn addition to his famous B minor setting of\nthe Mass, Bach wrote four 'short' settings\nconsisting of just a Kyrie and Gloria; the second\nitem of the concert was the G minor one of\nthese. Eric again succumbed to the temptation he\nalways has when conducting Bach, to take\nalmost everything at speeds approaching the\ncataleptic. This is a shame, because all these\nsettings benefit from the injection of a little life,\nwhich the singers and players just couldn't do\nwithin the bounds of the tempo set by the\nconductor. Among the three soloists, the\ncountertenor William Purefoy was a revelation.\nThe tendency of countertenors to 'hoot' just\nwasn't there and the purity of his tone had many\nfemale members of the Choir going weak at the\nknees!\nAfter the interval, we heard the second of\nBach's six motets, Der Geist hi lft. Over half of\nthis piece requires the choir to split into two,\nfour-part choirs, which is a brave thing to do\nwith a choir of this size and type (this is an\nentirely un auditioned choir). However, it kept\ntogether with only a few hints of nervousness\nand once they reached the single-choir section\nthat finishes the work they sounded much more\nassured.\nThe best had been very much saved until the\nlast, however. The members of the Choir really\nseemed to be enjoying themselves in Bernstein's Chichester Psalms and, although not every note\nwas perfect, the spirit really communicated itself\nto the audience. William Purefoy, the\ncountertenor soloist, was again superb and the\norchestra for the most part acquitted themselves\nwell (the most audible exception being the cello\nsolo in the middle movement...).\nOverall, this was not the best concert ever\ngiven by IC Choir, but the Bernstein made up for\na multitude of sins and among the soloists we\nwere certainly given a name to remember in\nWilliam Purefoy.\nChris Purvis\nStar Winds\nA fortnight ago in the Great Hall an audience of\nabout 350 people witnessed the musical offering\nfor this term from Imperial College Symphony\nOrchestra (ICSO) and their conductor, Richard\nDickins. In the second term they performed\nMahler's demanding Fifth Symphony; this term\nthey opted for a programme of more popular\nworks.\nThe concert began with the suite from\nTchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake. The performance certainly conjured up images of dancing\nswans but needed more enthusiasm - the final\nwaltz lacked 'oo mph' and the tempo of the first\nscene was a little slow. Nonetheless, the whole\norchestra played taut rhythms, bringing out the\nsyncopation in the score to great effect and\nproduced a coherent sound. However, the\nplaudits in this work go to the woodwind section\nwho consistently demonstrated very fine playing.\nIn particular, oboist Andrew Miller exhibited\ngreat feeling in the plaintive opening melody,\nskilfully accompanied by harpist Catrin MorrisJones.\nThe second work, Richard Strauss's Second\nHorn Concerto, turned the spotlight on one of\nthe orchestra's six horn players, Paul Gowling.\nHe shows a lot of potential as a soloist (he has\nalready performed at the South Bank and next\nterm begins a postgraduate course at the RCM)\nalthough he could have produced a more\nexpressive tone. A few of the virtuosic passages\nweren't always clearly articulated but there were\nremarkably few obviously wrong notes. The\norchestra's strings sometimes failed to get to\ngrips with the taxing score but not sufficiently to\nmarr the performance.\nAfter the interval we saw the welcome return\nof Butterworth to ICSO's repertoire. Two years\nago they played the rhapsody A Shropshire Lad\nand in Friday's concert they performed the\norchestral idyll The Banks Of Green Willow.\nFolksongs form the core of this work and the\nstrings managed to sustain a lyrical sound\nthroughout. Once again the woodwind added\ncolour to the performance with some fine solos.\nThe big finale to the concert was provided by\nmusic from John Williams' memorable score to\nthe film Star Wars. In this work it was the turn\nof the brass and percussion to show their mettle,\nnotably in the well-known fanfare at the\nbeginning of the first movement. The strings, in\ntheir big themes, produced a warm rounded tone;\nindeed, in this work the whole orchestra seemed\nto pull together much better. Richard Dickins\nalso showed great exuberance, bouncing on his\npodium during the climaxes.\nThe second movement, 'Princess Leia', consisted of a series of well-played solos on horn,\nflute and violins and the third movement, 'Little\nPeople', allowed us to hear the distinctive rustic\nsound of the cor anglais in Adam Poole's solos.\nThe players and audience enjoyed the concert\nand ICSO can be proud of another high-standard\nperformance.\nJames White\nWhat is it like to spend a year in Europe?

    "content": "6 Travel\nAn Education\nIn Itself\nSo, you have itchy feet but you\ncan't afford the time to work\nyour way around the world?\nWell, there is an alternative, as\nMartin Greenacre reports...\nI 've finally made it! What I read in the UCCA Handbook (as it\nwas then) all those years ago has now been realised. 'Civil\nEngineering with a Year in Continental Europe' has now\nbecome reality for me as I arrive at the 'Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule' in Aachen.\n560 students attended the introductory lecture for Civil\nEngineers. It was said straight away, not only by the academic\nbut also by the student from the departmental society, that over\nhalf of the assembled students would either fail or drop out\nbefore the end of the degree. 'Degree' is perhaps the wrong\nword, as what they call the 'Diplom' here is totally different to\nwhat we would understand as a degree.\nNo interviews take place. All you need is a good enough\naverage on leaving school. To study in Aachen you need quite a bit of luck as well. That is, there is a massive accommodation\nproblem here and finding somewhere to live has a lot to do with\ngood fortune. The table tennis room in one of the halls was used\nas emergency accommodation for the first month of term!\nThankfully, as exchange students, we get special treatment from\nthe accommodation office here, paying slightly over the odds\nfor the privilege. I'm not complaining, however, as the rent is\nstill under half of that in London.\nThe student year is structured as two semesters. This year,\nlectures ran from 11th October to 11th February and from 11th April to 8th July. The time between lecture periods is called\nholiday, which is code for 'exam time'. So, if you're lucky you\ncould get no holiday at all. That rarely happens as the German\nstudents choose which exams to do on the basis of the exam\ndates. They must eventually do all the exams but, at most, they\nsit two at a time and make sure that they have at least two\nweeks between them and usually a couple of weeks of actual\nholiday as well.\nThe word 'exam' takes on a whole new meaning in this\ncountry. They call them 'Klausers' and they are hard! In Civil\nEngineering each Klauscr examines material from at least two\nlecture courses and the associated coursework assignments. The\nassignments and exam questions are usually design-related\nwhich means taking the relevant Standards (DINs, as they are\ncalled here) into examinations and being able to work with\nthem...quickly. Just imagine - a five hour open-book exam,\nexamining one and a half years of lecture and coursework\nmaterial! Come back Imperial - all is forgiven!\nIn some respects the departments are similar to those in\nEngland. The academics arc all heavily involved in research\nwhich, in the end, largely contributes to the reputation of\nindividual departments. Teaching methods and standards vary\nfrom subject to subject. Some lectures are musts and some are\nright-offs. One thing I remembered from working in England\nlast summer was something a senior engineer once said to me:\n90% of what you learn at university you forget and never have\nto use again during your career. This ties in with a quote that I read recently: \"The soul and spirit of education is that habit of\nmind which remains when a student has completely forgotten\neverything he has been taught\" - Professor Sir Charles Inglis.\nThat situation is exactly the same in Germany.\nYou can't move for bars\nand night clubs . . . you\ncould easily spend the\nweek going to parties\nFrom this point of view, the English system has an\nadvantage: at least we only spend four years at most at\nUniversity, whereas the Germans take an average of six to\nseven years to complete their course before they finally start as\npractising engineers. They spend an extra year in school, too. If\nyou add that on to at least a year of compulsory military service\n(or it's equivalent), they don't usually finish until 27 or 28\nyears of age. That's why, when a student moves into a hall of\nresidence, he/she really makes it home; it gets painted, carpeted\nand furnished completely afresh. Understandable, I suppose, if\nyou're going to be there for seven years! I would estimate that,\nfor an average German student, the actual time they have free of\nlectures or exams during the year is about two and a half\nmonths.\nAachen itself is a great place to be as a student. There are\n230,000 people in this town and a quarter of them are students.\nYou can't move for bars, restaurants, night clubs and cinemas!\nYou could quite easily spend the whole week going to parties;\nthere are always several going on. At this time of the year, the\nbeginning of the semester, relatively little study is going on and\ncertainly nobody is breaking their back over books! If I'd been\nat Imperial College this year, I would already have done six\ncoursework assignments, with another ten to be in by\nChristmas! (OK, a slight exaggeration perhaps!) This does even\nitself out, as I will still be pen-pushing in August and\nSeptember next year. Trying to explain this to my Local\nEducation Authority in terms of extra grant for extra weeks is\npretty tricky.\nMoney is another difference between the two systems. We\nmay moan about the Government freezing the grant and\nTravel cheap y around Europe with Inter-Rail or Euroline tickets\n\n"

The plot is\nsuitably unbelievable: ten year old Henry\nRowengarter is a normal American kid with a normal mum and normal friends. I think we've\nall been here before. Then, surprise! Something\nweird happens. He falls while trying to catch a baseball at school and breaks his arm; it doesn't heal properly and he finds he has the amazing\nability to throw things very very fast. Cue all\nmanner of japes as the young lad goes to the\nmajor leagues, where he is inspired by has-been\nplayer Gary Busey and learns all about life.\nWhile not the most original debut in cinema\nhistory, Rookie Of The Year is nevertheless an\nimmensely enjoyable experience and Stern\nshows that he has learned much from the comic\ngeniuses he has worked with in his time. Some\nof the peripheral humour may be lost on British\nFirst class leg room isn 't what it used to be!\naudiences, I suspect. For example, many of the\nplayers were real and the game can at times be\nhard to follow; \"Come on guys, it's the bottom\nof the ninth and the bases are loaded!\" doesn't really mean that much to me. But, after Major\nLeague and A League Of Their Own, I knew\nenough to follow who was winning.\nAnyway, all sport movies are the same and\nthis one has more than enough going for it to\nretain your interest, not least the cameo role\nStern gives himself as an accident prone batting\ncoach. Once again all of the young leads are\nexcellent, proving that there are loads of good\nchild actors out there for less than $6ma movie.\nThe whole tone of the movie is amusing and\nthe implausible situation is handled with such\nskill and humour that you find yourself almost\nbelieving it. It is refreshing to see that\nHollywood can still produce such carefree pieces\nof fluff in such a professional manner; one is\nreminded immediately of the worst excesses of\nmovies such as Curly Sue and Can't Buy Me\nLove as examples of how it shouldn't be done.\nAnyway, well worth \u00a33.50 of anybody's money.\nIt's better than going to class isn't it?\nTony Grew\nOut already.

This leaves Mollie in a distressing situation: two big dogs, two kids and\na husband that is constantly away from home,\nflying around the world with another woman.\nJust when you thought things couldn't get\nany worse, Samantha demands that James flies\nher to the middle of nowhere on Christmas Eve,\nleaving Mollie to explain why Daddy can't be\nhome for Christmas. They do live happily ever\nafter, though, in typical Hollywood style.\nYou'd probably enjoy this film if you were a kid of about eight, but I'd suggest giving it a miss.\nToot & Magpie\nOut already.

    "content": "Travel 5\nArriving in Muar I was greeted by\nno-one. It's not a very big town and I was soon inviting strange looks.\nGrabbing the nearest telephone I phoned\nmy friend who apparently had decided\nto play football knowing full well that I was coming. His kind parents took pity\non me and picked me up instead.\nMuar is pretty unspectacular\ncompared to Kuala Lumpur but it was\ngood to get some peace and quiet.\nHence, most of the time was spent\neating, sleeping and watching TV. Time\nsoon passed by and it was time to move\non to Singapore which meant another of\nthose dreaded bus rides.\nThis time the stereo was not the\nproblem, there wasn't one. There also\nwas no suspension so sitting on the seat\nfor more than five seconds was a considerable problem. This went\non all the way to Johor Bahru, over the causeway and into\nSingapore and, after a while, I was so fed up that I just didn't care\nanymore.\nReaching Singapore I didn't really have a definite place to stay.\nAll I knew was that I was supposed to meet another in my long list\nof contacts at some place which was far from concrete. Fortunately,\nhe had arranged for me to stay at John's( yet another contact) house\nand very kindly drove me down there. Being the dope he was, he\ndropped me off at the wrong place. After an hour of waiting there, I decided that something was amiss. 1 then had to go through the long\nprocess of finding a phone. Sorting out the mess took another hour\nand this was all at around 11 o 'clock at night when I finally reached\na bed and slept.\nNext morning, 1 awoke to find John had prepared a full itinerary\nand was eager to get going. He is one of the best tour guides I have\never met and would be glad to write a reference to this effect any\nday. Off we set to Haw Par Villa which was a sort of Chinese\nMythology theme park - a good place to sit under a tree and watch\nit all happen. There were a lot more tourists here than in Malaysia,\nso I felt a little more at ease. After that, we checked out the town\nwhich is a shoppers' Utopia. Anything you want (well, just about)\nyou can find in the sprawl of malls and markets. The transport\nsystem was excellent, as well with their equivalent of the tube\n(called the MRT, Mass Rapid Transport) having a good range over\nthe island.\nAll too soon it was time to go. I had to get back up to Kuala\nLumpur to catch my flight out which meant yet another bus ride.\nThis time they showed a video, but it was in Cantonese which didn't help things at all, so I slept. After only seven hours I was back in\nExhaustion comes quickly to the 'public transport' in such a hot and humid climate\nKuala Lumpur and signalled a parting gesture to travelling on buses\nin general.\nFlying back, I reflected on my experiences. Both Malaysia and\nSingapore are diverse places to visit and you'll undoubtedly find\nyourself wishing you could stay longer. Travel and food arc cheap\nalong with just about anything else you want to buy. People are\nwarm and friendly but maybe that's just because they've been\nsitting in the sun too long.\nThere also was no suspension\nso sitting on the seat for\nmore than five seconds was a considerable problem.\nIf you do decide to go to either of these places, a visit to one of\nthe respective tourist boards would be a very wise move (even\nTrevor would approve). Don't forget those injections, otherwise you\nmight find yourself coming back with more than just that very loud\nT shirt and a lovely bunch of coconuts, so don't say I didn't warn\nyou. Finally, next year is visit Malaysia year so get up, get out and\ngo, go, go.\nP.S. If you want further information about visiting Malaysia or\nSingapore, don't ask me but go and find someone or something who\nknows what he's talking about.\nRiazul Islam\nIf you want to stick to Europe, read the other article on page 8\n\n"

    "content": "12 Clubs and Societies\nYacht Club - EDHEC 1994\nSaturday 16th April saw the start of the 26th EDHEC student regatta, a week long yacht\nfacing event. More than two hundred boats from\nUniversities all over the world participated and\nthe event was held in Les Sable D 'Olonne on the\nAtlantic coast of France. The Imperial College\nYacht Club was represented there by a team of\neight, led by skipper Thor Askeland and\nhelmsman Tim Parsons.\nThe previous day, the team members had\narrived in the small town after long hours of\ntravelling, only to find that the boat which had\nbeen hired for the race was missing its rig! Yes,\nit's that big tree trunk stuck in the middle of a sailing boat...basically it's what makes the boat\nmove. Morale was not at its best as we listened\nto our invaluable native guide and team mate\nAnthony Duyck skillfully negotiating the\nnecessary repairs with the boat charter ers. \"Oui,\noui, only a few hours,\" they assured us. Sunday\nmorning came and we were still watching\nhelplessly as the other boats sailed out to take\nadvantage of the last practice day.\nOn Monday morning the racing began and,\nwith our boat, repaired we set sail proudly flying\nthe College flag, the biggest in the fleet and the\nenvy of all the other teams. The next two days\nsaw us slowly but steadily gaining positions in\nour class division. The going was tough in the\nocean waves, especially for our bowman Matt\nCrossman taking the worst of the weather.\nWednesday evening and, after numerous\ndelays due to slackening winds, the fleet left port\nfor the toughest and most demanding race of the\nweek: the overnight regatta. The sun had already\nset as our boat neared the first mark while the\ntemperature dropped and the wind picked up.\nGood tactics and navigation put us in the leading\ngroup of our class halfway through the night but\nluck was not coming our way. At 2am, all the\nonboard instruments and lights shut down due to\na faulty battery. The problem was solved by\nrewiring the engine battery but not before we\nhad sailed for an hour with only a compass\nbearing to guide us. The race continued as the\nshifts took turns in the forbidding conditions,\nsustained only by the continuous supply of hot\nsoups and coffee from the galley. The boat was\npushed to the limit in the ten hour long up wind leg amidst cries of: \"She can't take much more\nof this cap'n!\" At the second mark the wind played some\nbad tricks on us and we lost some positions in\nthe leading pack. After more than twenty hours\nsailing we crossed the finish line in 14th place.\nSurprises were still on their way when, on\nFriday night, two of the crew, Anthony and\nCarlo, returned to the boat slightly intoxicated\nfrom a party and were heard remarking:\n\"Where's our flag gone?\"\n\"What flag?\"\n\"Oops!\"\nThe following morning we realised that our\nflag had become the trophy of an unknown sea\nscavenger. The same day, while rounding a mark, shouts and scraping sounds from the stern\nof our boat warned us that another boat was\nimpolitely trying to climb into our cockpit! Our\nprotest was discarded for a technical glitch but\nthe crew made it in one piece to an incredible\nfarewell party that evening; A+ for the\norganisers.\nOur final position was 20th out of the 37\nboats in our class and in the top 40 out of the\n245 teams overall. We are extremely grateful for\nthe help of the IC Trust, the Marketing\nDepartment, and Mr Vernon McCLure for\nmaking it all possible! The crew members who\nworked tirelessly include Natalie Chiang, Rick\nBilby, Carlo Contaldi, Anthony Duyck, Neil\nChamberlain, Matt Crossman, and Emmanuel\nOmont. Next year we hope to improve our\nposition even more!\nAnnual Dinner\nIF you would like to go sailing this Summer..\nIF you want to sail / race next year...\nIF you can tell great sailing stories (lies)...\nIF you will be in the UK in the next year...\nJoin Us!\nFriday 3rd June\nContact Maria Moratis, mm4@ doc,\nor Yacht Club Pigeonhole\nThe deadline for articles is Friday, 5pm "

Never has anything in an opera house\nso immediately disturbed me. We have a truly\nchilling assumption of the title role by Philip\nLangridge, returning to it in this revival of Tim\nAlbery's darkly stylistic 1991 production of\nBenjamin Britten's first operatic masterpiece.\nLangridge employs his hauntingly beautiful\nvoice to magnificent effect, with none of the\nmannerisms that can distort the character into a raging bear (a la Vickers) or whining academic\n(Pears on the composer's own recording). Every\nsyllable is projected with crystalline accuracy -The play, although the publicity would have you\nbelieve otherwise, is in no way a 'sexual\ntragedy'; it is more along the lines of a tragedy\nof love. In the manner of many age old plays it\nprovides an insight into a royal court; through\nthe trappings of an enforced marriage which\ndivides a loving couple. The Royal court in this\ncase is the ancient Greek court of Sparta.\nThere is little comedy in the play, although a clever performance by Simon Treves, as a Spartan lord lusting after the beautiful Penthea,\nprovides small doses of humour reminiscent of\nRowan Atkinson's Blackadder with the facial\nexpressions of John Cleese. Zoe Aldrich,\nalthough extremely good looking, gives a absolutely sensational!\nWorking to reinforce this achievement in the\npit was the dynamic David Atherton. Although\nthe score may have been stripped of some of its\nlyrical gloss, what was revealed was something\nmore elemental and disconcerting ly truthful.\nDespite a few reservations about the rest of\nthe cast (Janice Cairns' Ellen was surely a miscalculation) I cannot imagine many finer\nexamples of live theatre.\ni qq y In rep at the Coliseum, St Martin's Lane WC2N\n071 836 3161.

The plot\nfollows half a century of the Cowpers, a well-to-do family unable to escape from what, in the\nend, only seems inevitable. The ageing Harry\nCowper, competently played by James\nLaurenson, stands - and finally hobbles - like a metaphor for post-war England itself...declining.\nHarry's son, Matt (Daniel Betts), cannot stray\nfrom following in his father's footsteps which\nlead him to the very same English middle-class\nconservatism he once dreaded. James Laurenson\nagain plays the ageing Cowper as if to hammer\nhome this point.

    "content": "4 Travel\nMoneyless in\nMalaysia..\nHaving one day decided that I was going to do more with possibly\nmy last summer vacation, the next step was deciding what? So, after\nmuch searching for a bolt of lightning that was willing to hit me, the\nanswer came to me in simple mathematical terms:\nLittle money + a reluctance to rob\na bank to provide it\n: go stay with a friend\nAfter all, what are friends for? So, after much twisting of arms, I managed to find a few who were willing to accommodate me. As\nluck would have it, a sizeable number of them lived in lands of the\nthree s' s and instantly my mind was made up, Malaysia and\nSingapore. However, in the back of my mind was still a small\nproblem: money, or the lack of it to be more precise. Deliverance\ncame in the form of a travel bursar y from Shell; so X amounts of\ngratitude to Peter Ashford and the crew for their assistance.\nGetting to Malaysia is fairly easy, but 1 would recommend using\na plane. Just follow these basic procedures and you should be\nalright:\ni) You part with your money.\nii) For this, you gel some sheets of paper (nicety coloured if\nyou're lucky).\nHi) Go to the airport and give this to anybody you can find\nwearing a gratuitous amount of make-up and with a demented smile on their face.\niv) Exchange your pieces of paper for an altogether less\nspectacular one.\nv) Use this new piece of paper to get on the plane of your\nchoice.\nvi) If this seems complicated to you, stay at home.\nOn a more serious note, with a bit of hunting around the less\nglamourous travel agents, you should be able to find a decently\npriced ticket (around \u00a3400 return) but don't expect any luxuries like\na guaranteed seat. It didn't happen to me, but many friends have\nturned up to the airport on the day of their flight only to be told that\nthere wasn't one. But, in the words of Trevor the Wise (a used car\nsalesman): \"You only get what you pay for, mate.\"\nNow, with any luck you should arrive at Subang International in\nKuala Lumpur brimming with eagerness. A lot of time and money\nhas gone into the airport and it shows. Unfortunately, I didn't have\nmuch time to kill as there was a large number of suspicious\nindividuals on my plane who had that illegal immigrant look in their\neyes. I proceeded with haste to immigration before the siege set in.\nAs I waved a fond farewell to the nice customs men and walked\nout into Malaysia, it hit me. Although I had lived in other tropical\ncountries, that was quite a while ago and Mr Heat along with Mr\nHumidity take vindictive pleasure in making one suffer. This is one\nThe jewel of South East\n\u2022 Asia, a chaotic jungle of\ndreams, skyscrapers and,\nerr, jungles. But just how\neasy is it to 'go east' ?\nplace where deodorant sales are never down. Loose, thin, baggy\nclothes are highly advisable, but don't dress to shock otherwise\nyou'll soon get that 'I'm a tourist and look it' feeling. Whatever you\ndo don't go in with your size 12 Dr Martins, the Union Jack\ndisplayed from the majority of your surface area shouting \"Ere we\ngo, ere we go\". People will just think your mad, which is probably\nvery plausible.\nI spent the first week in and around Kuala Lumpur. My friend\nlived some distance from the city centre which meant a bus journey.\nNow, to be a bus driver in Kuala Lumpur you have to be two things.\nThe first is to have no immediate relatives and the second is to be\ncertified as being a few sandwiches short of a picnic. If you're into\nnear death experiences then this is the ultimate.\nSkyscrapers battle it out for supremacy while the traditional\nshops and stalls in between sit\nback and watch it all happen.\nDragging myself around on the first day was an effort; stops at\nthe nearest watering hole were a frequent occurrence. However, the\nsheer atmosphere of the place soon made up for it. The whole city is\na contrast of the old with the new. Skyscrapers battle it out for\nsupremacy while the traditional shops and stalls in between sit back\nand watch it all happen. If you've got money, this is as good a place\nas any to spend it. The good was cheap so, taking full advantage of\nthis, I tried to sample as much of it as possible.\nAfter seeing most of the tourist y things with embarrassing\ncamera in tow for validation of tourist status, it was time to move\non. I had to get to Muar on the east coast so so I made my way\ndown to the bus garage to see if they could solve my problem. Most\nfortunate was 1 as my translator informed me that the next bus was\nleaving in ten minutes and I had better get my butt down there now\nif I wanted to catch it. Proceeding without delay 1 boarded the bus\nwhile simultaneously thanking my friend. A few minutes later and\nwe were off into the wild blue yonder until we hit major traffic at\nwhich point 1 decided to fall asleep.\nI awoke when the bus driver decided to turn on his radio. That\nwasn't too bad but then someone decided he wanted to try out his\nnew UB40 album which he handed to the bus driver to play at full\nvolume. So, for the next hour my ears were tortured by such lyrics\nas \"Every hour of every day I'm yearning more\". Anyway, that's what it sounded like and I was damn relieved when the bus driver\nhad enough and turned it off.\nRead about travelling around the world on page 8\n\n"

In between are two classic\ntunes, jingling mellowness laced with sparkling,\nfluted high vocals. Worth the wait.

Despite\nthe drug-infatuated lyrics present in most songs,\nthe Sheep seem to deal more with the problems\nof drugs - as in 'Slap Happy' and 'Slim Jim'\nwith its call of \"speed kills, but I'm too young to\ndie\" - as well as those of life in the 1990s. Examples of such are 'Chasing Dreams' telling\nthe tale of mis-spent youth and \"killing time with\ncar crime\", the fairly self evident 'Slow Suicide'\nor the musical interludes such as 'Beefcake' or\n'Clucking' which contain everyday noises\nreflecting urban decay. The combination of such\nlyrics with a twisted hybrid techno brings a new\nview, as well as responsibility, to the e'd up\nr avers which has up until now been disregarded.\nNevertheless, the Sheep have not lost their\nview that life is a party as the first single 'Let The\nGood Times Roll' shows.

As to the replies themselves, the\n'significance of the comment' on submission is\nvalid. A letter for issue 998 was not printed and\nthe only conceivable reason was that it was not\non disk. The real point of the letter sadly appears\nto have been missed, namely the lack of news\nand dirge of features. The News Editor, a man\nwho must be kept about as busy as the Finland\nMountain Rescue Service, said quite rightly that\n'students have a right to know what is going on\nin the Union and the College and it is Felix\npolicy to try and keep them informed'. Either\nImperial is the dullest place in the universe or he\nis saying one thing and doing the complete\nopposite. How on earth do you expect to 'keep\n[the students] informed' with such scant news\ncoverage? This week we had seven news items\nand an apology that shows that what little filters\nthrough to the page is often badly researched.\nSurely it must be possible to assign a few\nmore of your contributors to reporting what goes\non here rather than resorting to the most blatant\nspace-fillers imaginable, like the dire, one and\nhalf page article on the Times Crossword\nChampionships. Not really the cutting edge of\nradical student journalism is it, Beccy? For\nGod's sake, what is happening? I though for a minute it was a brilliant spoof, but alas not. It\ncertainly deserves space, but nowhere near as\nmuch as it had. If a copy of this issue ever leaks\nout of College, IC will be the laughing stock of\nthe British University system.

Or perhaps I 've missed the\nhoards of professional crossword ers around\nhere.\nWe are constantly reminded that,rightly,you\nare the Editor. You decide what goes in. You\ndecide the format and the style, but not in\nsplendid isolation from the views of the\nstudents. You yourself have admitted that 'a common complaint is that there are too many\nreviews', but have done absolutely nothing\nabout it. The only reason for the lack of change\nmust be your own intransigence. There are\nplenty of contributors - start commissioning a more balanced range of material. How about\ntelling us what's going on at ULU and the other\ncolleges? If we had more than one College\nnewspaper here, such a view would be\nacceptable.

Troublesome\nprisoners are removed from their incarceration\nand sent to the hostile island, Absolom. Here the\nisland's convicts have grouped themselves into\ntwo factions, the Outsiders and the Insiders. The\nOutsiders have become total savages, while the\nInsiders have set up a self supporting community\nwith their own laws and rules.\nIn comes Marine Captain John Robbins\n(Liotta), a decorated soldier who at first seems to\nbe in the wrong place. However, after murdering\nhis commanding officer in cold blood and then\nupsetting the Warden (Lerner) of the Leviticus\nMaximum Security facility, he ends up on this\nisland. Here he gets captured by the ruthless\nOutsiders, led by Marek (Wilson), manages to\nescape and then winds up in the Insiders camp,\nled by a man just called Father (Henriksen).\nHowever, as the Outsiders have a tendency to\nraid the Insiders' camp, this story turns into the\nunderdogs beating the overwhelming number of\nOutsiders with the help of the reluctant Captain\nRobbins.\nA subplot revolves around Father trying to\ntell the world about this prison island which\nThis is a tragic love story set in St Petersburg\nabout how an introvert falls in love with the\nwoman of his dreams, Nastenka, played by\nAnna Barkan (alias Nadia from Eastenders).\nWhen they first meet, they tell their life-stories:\nthe one of the sheltered Nastenka and the one of\nthe introvert who feels saddened by his life\nbecause he is left to make friends with the city\nof St Petersburg. The poetic charm of this lonely\nman steals her heart for a slender moment until\nher lover from her past comes back to fulfil his\npromise to marry her.\nThere are only three members in the cast, but\nI felt that no holes were left unfilled. David\nAxel, who plays the introvert, has the sympathy\nof the audience despite the character's eccentric\nideas about life. Anna Barkan debuts with this\nplay and does well, although there were a few\nmoments of hesitation. Her naive and confused\ndoesn't exist to the outside world. In the attempt\nto expose the Warden's illegal activities, Father\nrelies on the skills of Dysart (Jack Shepherd), an\ninvaluable inventor, to build a boat that will\nsneak past the Warden's security measures.\nThere is an interesting performance from\nStuart Wilson: his character, Marek, sadistically\nfinds humour in outrageous acts of cruelty and\nviolence and often portrays himself as the\nisland's concierge. In the Insiders' camp there\nare some unusual characters: the junk man, who\nscavenges the objects washed up on the shore;\nthe Irish moonshine r, played by Don Henderson;\nand the colony's perfect host, who has a fastidious nature of cleanliness.\nNastenka worked but, unfortunately, her Russian\naccent did not help very much.\nThe play was funny in a few parts. However,\nthere were places where the play did not run as\nsmoothly as it should, which may be because of\nthe translation from the Russian original.\nThis is the first offering from Charika to\nattempt to adapt Dostoyevsky's White Nights. It\nasked questions about the way we love one\nanother and whether the briefest of moments\nwith the one you love is all you need. Don't get\nme wrong, it doesn't deal with these situations,\nbut it brings them out to be thought about once\nmore. The play isn't enlightening or flashy but it\ndoes well for a small production.\nJack\nNew End Theatre, 27 New End. 071 794 0022.\nTube: Hampstead.

    "content": "News 3\nJournalist's Rights Violated\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nA former Felix Editor is to have his\ncase heard in the European Court of\nHuman Rights after he was fined\n\u00a35,000 for refusing to reveal his\nsources.\nBill Goodwin (27) was Felix\nEditor in the academic year 1988-89. He went to work as a trainee\nreporter for The Engineer where he\nreceived confidential financial\ninformation about Tetra Ltd, a computer company. He was told\nover the phone by an informant that\nthe company was in financial\ntrouble and was urgently seeking a large loan.\nMr Goodwin contacted a senior\nexecutive of Tetra Ltd about the\ninformation. The company then\nobtained an injunction preventing\npublication of the story. It claimed\nthat the information had been stolen\nfrom its offices and might be passed\non to customers or competitors,\nthreatening the jobs of 400 employees and the company's survival.\nTetra Ltd wanted to take action\nagainst the informant but were\nunable to as Mr Goodwin refused to\nreveal the person's identity, even\nwhen the High Court ordered him to\nin November 1989. Mr Goodwin\nwas later fined \u00a35,000 for contempt\nof court, which he felt was a breach\nof his freedom of expression. At the\ntime, he told Felix that, although he\nhad faced a possible 12 year jail\nsentence, he had not been imprisoned \"because of the publicity\". His\ncase was later thrown out of the\ncourt of appeal and discarded by the\nHouse of Lords without a hearing.\nHowever, it was revealed last\nWednesday that The European\nCommission of Human Rights is to\nrefer the case to the European Court\nof Human Rights after ruling that\nthe British Government violated the\nreporter's rights. If the court agrees\nwith this ruling, Britain will be\nforced to provide stronger protection\nfor journalists under the 1981\nContempt of Court Act.\nIn a ruling that the Government\nhad violated article 10 of the\nConvention of Human Rights the\nCommission said: \"[We] consider\nthat the protection of the sources\nfrom which journalists derive information is an essential means of\nenabling the press to perform its\nimportant function of 'public\nwatchdog' in a democratic society.\"\nThe Commission felt that, as the\nmatter was not one affecting national\nsecurity, there was no justification\nin ordering Mr Goodwin to identify\nhis source. They also decided that\nthe company's claim that 400 jobs\nwould be lost as a result of the\ninformation being made public was\nunsubstantiated and that it had not\nsuffered any of the harm predicted.\nGeoffrey Robertson, QC for Mr\nGoodwin said: \"This decision is\nimportant because it is the first time...\n[the Commission] has accepted that\nthe right to freedom of expression\nmust extend to protect people who\ndisclose newsworthy information to\njournalists. Our contempt law fails to\ngive journalists the protection they\nneed to tell the public the truth.\"\nMr Goodwin told Felix that he is\nhoping for a favourable ruling,\nsaying: \"As part of a settlement, I would ask the Government to\nchange the law...Britain is very\nbackward [in contempt law] compared to other European countries.\"\nImperial Enters The Big League\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nImperial College is once more in\nthe top three in The Times\nUniversity League tables.\nThis is the second year that The\nTimes has published tables ranking\nall British Universities. It has also\nprinted the criteria on which the\nleague table was based.\nAlthough Imperial College has\ncome third in the overall league, it\nhas been placed at the top of four of\nthese criteria tables. Imperial\nCollege held the pole position in\nGovernment supported research,\nstaff with PhDs, contract research\nand the number of students attaining\nfirst class honours.\nIn an interview with Felix Dr\nRodney Eastwood, Deputy\nManaging Director of Imperial\nCollege, questioned the reliability\nof the tables saying that although\nthey are \"good publicity\", the\nCollege could not \"put a lot of credence on it\".\nThe league was not all good\nnews. The College came a poor\n37th in the student accommodation\nleague, with only 40% of students\nliving in accommodation provided\nby College. Institutions rating high\nin this category offer housing for\nover 70% of their students.\nImperial College also fared\nbadly on drop out rates (40th, with\n10% of students not completing\ntheir degrees) and graduate employment (59th, with 13% of graduates\nstill unemployed six months after\ngraduation).\nTeaching Awards\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nImperial College is to present new\nTeaching Awards to staff at the\nCommemoration Day in October.\nThe Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh, has initiated the setting up\nof a scheme to raise the profile of\nteaching within the College. A provisional plan for the awards has\nbeen developed by the Pro-Rector,\nJohn Archer, and discussed by the\nBoard of Undergraduate Studies.\nThe staff/student committees and\nheads of each department will\nchoose the recipient of their\n'Excellence in Teaching' award on\nthe grounds of who has made the\nmost outstanding contribution to\nundergraduate teaching in the\ndepartment.\nThe names of winners, along\nwith supporting citations, will be\nsubmitted to an adjudicating\ncommittee (including student representatives) who will choose the\nrecipients of the 'Teaching Fellow\nof 1994' awards in science, engineering and medicine. These\nawards, including cash prizes of\n\u00a31000, will be presented at the\nCommemoration Day ceremony in\nOctober.\nSoup Run\nIn Peril\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nThe future of the Soup Run is in\ndoubt due to a lack of minibus\ndrivers.\nThe Soup Run is organised by\nthe Imperial College Community\nAction Group (ICCAG) and offers\nfood to London's homeless.\nDespite placing adverts in Felix\nrequesting more volunteer drivers,\nnone have come forward.\nThe current minibus driver leaves\nat the end of this term, leaving the\nvolunteers without transport.

One of the best ways to spend this time is taking a trip around the world.\nThe first thing to do when you have decided to take that round-the-world trip is to plan where you want to go. Buy or borrow copies of\ngood travel books, such as the 'Lonely Planet' or 'Rough Guide'\npublications. You will find that there will be a book or section on\nmost major travel destinations in the world. These provide invaluable\ninformation about sights, customs, travel within countries,\naccommodation, places to eat and so on.\nHaving established the areas of the world you wish to visit, the\nnext step is to plan the actual route. The most important thing to\nremember here is that to make use of a round-the-world ticket, you\nmust always travel in the same direction; no back-tracking is allowed.\nTravel is one of life's great educators.

    "content": "Travel 7\nA French Eye On Imperial College\nAfter one year as an exchange student under the ERASMUS scheme, I would like to write a few remarks\nabout Imperial College and my experiences of this year.\nFirst, let me present myself. I am a physicist and I have followed a mixture of courses in second and third\nyear physics courses in the Physics department.\nThen, what? Well, about your courses. The physics courses are much less theoretical than In France,\nexcept for a few lecturers where they probably are the best I ever had. In general, you do what we call\n'Physics With Hands'. It Is an alternative which has Its good and bad points.\nOne thing I noticed about the exams Is that the mark you get seems to correspond to how well you have\nlearned by heart the lecture notes. But you get the same problem everywhere. It Is hard to take an exam\nwhich will show your understanding of physical phenomena. Fortunately, the comprehensive papers (I did not\ntake them but I had a look) are made to complete your degree In this way. It is missing In France.\nNow, I must admit, it is quite hard to make friends with you British. Is it my fault? Maybe, but I found\nlots of friends among European {except Eng\\\\sh) and asian people. You are said to have the personality of\npeople living on an Isolated island. I think it seems quite true, for geographical as well as 'behavioural'\nreasons. However, lots of effort Is made to open this university up to the wild world: all your clubs and\nsocieties, every exchange scheme, Felix itself that I have read for a year more or less regularly, tend to\nprove It.\nHow, some of you are going to say: \"If he didn't like It, he should have stayed at home!\" Well, first, 1 could\nnot have known before coming and second, I think that being there opens your mind and develops your own\npersonality.\nFinally, my last words will go to every person who is going to spend a year or more away from London\nand/or their home. Do It Ifyou can afford it! Nothing will replace this experience In your life! And try to enjoy\nyourself where you go (I did with the IC Dance Club).\nAxel Pleuchot\nintroducing the student loan system, but the latter is the norm in\nthe rest of Europe. In the last two months I 've met people from\nall over Europe and the vast majority of them have to repay all\nor part of the money they get from their respective\ngovernments.\nJust imagine - a five hour\nopen-book exam, examining\none and a half years of lecture and coursework material!\nThe starting salaries for engineers is significantly higher in\nGermany. You can reckon on an absolute minimum of \u00a320,000.\nI suppose this reflects the slightly higher cost of living and a longer time at university, with a qualification in the MSc/PhD\nclass on leaving. It's not really an issue at the moment anyway\nbecause it is getting so difficult to get a job full stop!\nUnemployment among graduates is on the up in Germany,\naccording to an article in 'Der Spiegel' recently. Luckily that\nproblem is still a few lectures and a couple of Klausers away for\nmc. You never know, it might all be different by then (ha ha!).\nOn the clubs and societies front there seems to be a predominance of sport. Everybody seems to keep fit regularly\nand you can certainly find a club for every sport under the sun\nhere. There are at least three student choirs and symphony\norchestras, as well as brass and jazz bands. There are also\nforeign student societies, although the percentage of foreign\nstudents is not as high as at Imperial College. Things like\ndebating societies is something there isn't so much of here,\nwhich is perhaps surprising as German students are certainly\nopinionated enough.\nThe male/female ratio is where RWTH Aachen really falls\ndown. I'm not sure of the overall figure but, in Mechanical\nEngineering for example, which is the biggest department here,\nit is about 3% female. That department alone has about as many\nstudents as the whole of Imperial College. Because the\nproportion of students here is relatively high, the imbalance\nbetween men and women is something you notice almost\nimmediately. It is still significantly harder for women to get\ninto engineering and sciences in Germany.\nThe Germans are certainly living up to their reputation of\nbeing thorough. This system of university education doesn't let\nyou skim over any subject area that is even remotely connected\nwith any particular discipline; they examine you on everything!\nIf anything, they are trying to shorten the Diplom at the\nmoment. RWTH Aachen has just tried to get approval for a new\nexamination system but it was turned down by local\ngovernment on the basis of the course being too long. We will\nsee. In the meantime wc carry on with what we've got.\nMartin Greenacre\nNovember 1993, Aachen.\nSee page 8 for more details. More info available from STA Travel\n\n"
