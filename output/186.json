January 17th.? No, no, its\nbeen changed again, this time to the 29th,u tiles, of course, this\n/appears inconvenient at last minute, in which case, the new date\nwill be the n th of February, where n is an integer between\n1 and 28 (or is it going to be the 29th?). Apparently, pressure has been exerted on the Executive by\nthe Union to change the date of the Union Meeting in view of\nthe fact that a large number of people are at the moment in\nthe throes of half-session al exams, and can ill afford the odd\nhour off one lunchtime to attend. As a result, the Meeting has\nonce again been postponed, this time to February 7.\nOn the fact fo it, all the postponements appear fully justified,\nthough an outside observer might be equally justified in describing them as a disguised filibuster, to kill the NUS issue dead\nbefore it' gets on its feet'., Meanwhile, the President has still\nnot stated whether he is going to speak or not. and if so, on\nwhat side. The suspense is killing.\nCOL CUT TI'm sick to death of this Common Market issue. Does it really\nmatter whether we go in or not ? Is it really worth all the hull a ballo o? Why can't we have another in quo rate Union Meeting and\nforget all about it ?

The NUS decision\nis difficult enough to make without having the debate confused\nby petty bickering about irrelevant personal suspicions. It is\nindeed a shame, that in this age\nof Telestar, we still cannot communicate from one side of our\nUnion to the other. I hope that\nwhen the day of judgment finally\ncomes the Union will still be interested enough to turn up and\ndecide the issue.\nI hear the Chairman of the\nACC was stranded in Cardiff\nboon to have him buried in a snow drift for the next Council\nMeeting\u2014it might finish in a reasonable time then.\nWhere was Sennet last week ?\nCould they have gone bankrupt ?\nIf they must pay the 'College\nagent Id. a copy for selling the\nrag, they must expect financial\ndisaster.

What is\nthis Overseas Service Week all\nabout ?\nThe idea was thought of last\nsession by David Prentis, a third\nyear mathematician, and he\npassed it on to me before leaving\nCollege in the Summer. I found\nthat the idea quickly gained support from many people, both staff\nand students, and so during last\nterm a group of students came together to get on with the job of\norganising O.S. W. It was only\nthen that we discovered that\nmany other Universities have\nalready held weeks very similar\nto the one we are planning.\nThe aim of O.S. W. is not to\ndrain this country of rts scientists\nand engineers, but to present all\nthe opportunities for working\nabroad. The developing countries\nneed qualified people ; they need\npeople who will work in government posts, go abroad with private companies, or spend a year\nafter graduating working overseas with voluntary organisations. This sort of work can develop your character and give you\nchances of experience and responsibility which cannot be\nfound in the security of Great\nBritain. During the O.S. M., experts will talk about conditions\nabroad and the channels through\nwhich jobs are filled.\nI hope that many I.C. students\nwill want to find out more about\nthis sort of work. During the\nweek there will be an information\ncentre in Committee Room B which will be open from 12.30\np.m. to 7.0 p.m. every day. There\nyou will be able to obtain details\nof every type of work available\nin the developing countries.

Born of\ntwo parents, one male and one\nfemale, and attended Wakefield\nGirls' School (but went to the\nboys' school for Physics lessons).\nAt I.C. she captains the ICWA\nrunning team, helps organise sales\nof Stynx and Felix, plays hockey\nand goes horse-riding.\nShe was last seen alone, wearing a short, green, lamb's wool\ncoat, with a man(?) in her room.\nStudy the photo of this Wanted\nICWArian carefully, she probably sold you your copy of Felix !\nIf you have any information of\nher whereabouts, contact the\nCarnival Queen Selection Committee, so that they may judge\nher for themselves.\nThere is no doubt in my mind\nthat she is the most eligible girl,\nand therefore I demand the maximum penalty.\nJOHN M. EVANS.\nI.C. Prosecutor.\nJENNIFER CHAPMAN\nThe election of Jenny Chapman as I.C. Carnival Queen 1963\nwould give us not only a gay and\nglamourous figure-head for our\nCarnival Week functions, but\nwould be a fitting recognition of\nthe tremendous otherwise selfless\neffort she will again be making\ntowards the Carnival preparation.\nJenny is an ICWArian who soon\nrealised that she could never do\nenough for the college whilst not\nliving here, and so now she has a room in Beit Hostel.\nThis 24hr.a day presence in the\nUnion precincts is put to good\nuse, and she seldom rests from\nher ard ours on behalf of one or\nother of the several societies of\nwhich she is an active member.\nA second year Zoology student,\nher years and wisdom are above\nthose of her fellows due to the\ntransitory period she spent earning her living as Veterinary Entomologist, handling parasitic flies\nand ticks. Her refined and feminine nature did not suffer by this\nhowever any more than it has\ndone since she left her Mother\nat home in Hertfordshire and\ncame to the Big City.\nShe has a talent for organising\nwhich is happily combined with\na generous nature so that she is\noften much over-burdened with\nwork apart from study. But\nnothing gives her more satisfaction than to do a thing herself,\nand from this point of view we\nshould feel lucky that she is\naround at a time when we need\njust such a person.\nJenny's willingness to help\nshould not be misconstrued, and\nT call u o on every Union member to show their approval that\nJennifer Chapman should help\nour 1963 by taking office as the\nmost competent ever Carnival\nOueen.\nGRAHAM B. WHITE.\n\n"

WEALE\nThis is not at all an easy essay to write, particularly when (a) its\nsubject is a friend, (b) he will see it before publication, and (c) he is\nmuch bigger than I am. Let's face it: Ken Weale is bigger than\nmost of us, not only in sheer physical size but in talents and breadth\nof interest as well. It is customary in these profiles to reveal the\nsubject's age. This I cannot do w tih any certainty, except to say\nthat he is probably even older than I am, and has achieved that\nvulgar business of throwing the ball about (and the other players)\ndegree of maturity at which rug ger playing gentlemen abandon the\nand take to refereeing. He continues to play cricket with considerable\nskill and vigour, but we are now\nunfortunately denied the equally\nspectacular but wildly contradictory accounts of their respective\nprowess es delivered after Sunday\nmatches by Ken and Kitch (ex-President Kitchen).\nAcademically, Ken is no mean\npundit on high-pressure chemical\nmanifestations of one sort and\nanother. Except on Lord's Days\nin summer and Wealemas Day\n(Birthday Dec. 26th) in winter, he\ninhabits an extraordinary room\nbuilt almost entirely of sheet\niron, standing in a gloomy lab\nin Chem. Eng. By applying an\neye to fortuitous bolt-holes, he\ncan observe the diligence of his\nstudents : no doubt they can indulge in the converse process.\nHis fame as an orator is wide-spread, partly due to a fe nile and rather improbable imagination and a majestic delivery.\nRolling phrases of ingenious construction and great complexity,\noften with a hint of an elder\nstatesman about them, have delighted many generations of stu-dents. If one is part of the same\nprogramme, one can expect to be\nutterly overshadowed by a performance which relies on considerable feats of memory. A favourite source of quotations is the\ngreat Dr. Johnson (\" There is\nnothing which has yet been contrived by man, by which so much\nhappiness is produced as by aO ood tavern or inn.\")\nEqually famous is his rendition\nof a speech (circa 1938) made by\na now-discredited national leader.\nPerformed in the I.C. bar, the\neffect is fairly spectacular ; in the\nQueen's, with suitable audience\nparticipation, it is nearly as startling as the original ; and it is related that the gala performance\nat Jack McCoubrey's( ex-Sub-Warden of Weeks Hall) bachelor\nparty woke up the Warden of an\nadjacent Hall.\nResidents of Falmouth Hall will\nbe singularly fortunate in their\nWarden. Not only is Ken steeped\nin the fine traditions of the original Hostel, but he is suspected of\nhaving started some of them. In\na reminiscent mood, he is inclined\nto produce lurid tales of the immediately post-war years, such as\nthe occasion of the explosion on\nthe Old Hostel roof, the consequences of which are with us still.\nMembers of the Union, particularly club treasurers, will know\nhim as custodian of the Union\ncoffers and are adv source of\nwisdom, often providing elegant\nsolutions to awkward administrative problems. From his shuttered concrete penthouse, Ken\nwill bring to bear on Falmouth\nHall these manifold talents and,\nmost important of all, a genuine\nliking for and understanding of\nhis students.\nFRANK.\n\n"

UNION MEETING\nPOSTPONED\nMeanwhile (See pages 2 and 6)\nN.U.S. the President sums up\nAn incredible number of rumours have been circulating around\nthe Uiion regarding NUS. Since it is vital that the arguments put\nto the Union Meeting should have a factual basis, I have checked\nup on a number of the relevant pros and cons. Having listened to\nboth sides, I feel sure that what you find in this article will be a fairly representative factual case for both sides.\nAccompanying this article is a line diagram of the structure\nof NUS. This I hope will give you some idea of the basic skeleton\nover which the fleshy parts of NUS have been built. It is these\naccumulations that gave rise to conflicting opinions.\nThe case for NUS can be put like this :\u2014\nNUS is simply a body which led to believe that it was the\nrepresents student opinion nation- Ministry's intention gradually to\nally. There is no question about\nthe fact that it is a representative body, in the sense that 97 per\ncent, of the students in Britain are\nmembers of it (approx. 175,000\nmembers). What has the Union\ndone for students ? It is vague\nto say that NUS campaign for\nadequate grants, good welfare\ncondition and facilities for stu-dents. What has it really\nachieved in these directions ?\nHere are some of the achievements :\u2014\nThe Ministry of Pensions required a post-graduate student\nto pay the heavy Class 2 contributions as a self-employed per-son. N.U.S. immediately took up\nthe matter with them and was\nGORDON LOWE S The ideal Sports Shop\nGOOD DISCOUNTS FOR\nALL IC MEMBERS\n21-23 Brorn?ton Arcade,\nKmightsbridge, S.W.3 KEN4494/5/6 levy such contributions from all\npost-graduates in the country, on\nthe grounds that they were engaged in original research, could\nnot therefore be receiving super-vision, and were consequently not\nin full-time education.\nAfter taking Legal advice, negotiating with the Ministry of\nPensions and National Insurance\nand other bodies concerned,\napproaching the University authorities and having questions\nasked in the House of Commons,\nN.U.S. finally arranged through\nMr. Fred Mulley, M.P. for an Adjournment Debate on the case.\nShortly afterwards the Ministry\nannounced a complete reversal of\npolicy and agreed to repay in\ncash any post-graduate student\nfrom whom contributions had\nbeen wrongly levied. The N.U.S. was the only body which raised\nthis question on behalf of\nstudents.\nAs N.U.S. regards the insurance position of students as basically . unsatisfactory, short-term\npolicy of the Union has laid\ndown from time to time interim\nmethods of alleviating difficulties;\nas an example, a resolution at\nCouncil recommended that students be allowed to repay their\nClass 3 contributions during the\nfirst six years of employment. The\npoint was taken up strongly with\nthe Minister and, after much ne-got i ation, was conceded towards\nthe end of 1956.\nSince nearly half the members\nof ICU are postgraduate, this\nUnion has benefited considerably\nin this respect\nPressure from NUS was the\nmain cause for the appointment\nof the Anderson Committee\nwhose recommendations were\nvery substantially in line with\nthe NUS policy on grants. At the\nmoment, NUS is campaigning for\nthe abolition of the parental\nmeans test, and is lobbying the\nStanding Advisory Committee on\nAwards constantly. They managed to convince the Committee\nin principle of the virtue of payment of a maintenance grant during vacations ; the Ministry has\nyet to accept this, but the pressure is not being relaxed.\nNUS publishes the standard\nbook on grants, the \" Grants\nYear Book \" which includes the\ndetails of grant arrangements of\nall local authorities, etc. It lists\nthe major trusts and charities\nwhich consider applications from\npoor students. For some time,\nNUS has been campaigning to\nconvince local authorities that\nloans are not a proper form of\nassistance to students. There\nwere 147 of these and the last one\nwas convinced in 1975. (Loans\nare still offered by L.E.A.S. in\nspecial circumstances).\nNUS has submitted detailed\nmemoranda to the Robbins Committee on Higher Education, to\nthe Hale Committee and on safety\nprovisions in Institutes of higher\nlearning. It goes to great lengths\nin doing research required to prepare these memoranda which\nhave been very well received.\nThe main purpose of the\nN.U.S. is to represent its members\nin matters affecting their welfare.\nIt has, of course, no coercive\npower as such but can achieve\nits aims by winning public support and by bringing pressure to\nbear on national, local and college authorities.\nMost important of these are the\nMinistry of Education and the\nDepartment of Scientific and Industrial Research. The Union's staff and officers are constantly\nin touch with them for discussions on grants problems and\nmaintain a regular correspondence direct with the Minister. In\nturn, their officers now always\nattend the N.U.S. Council Meetings and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry has twice addressed Council. Deputations are\nreceived by the education committees of the Parliamentary\nParties and Government Committees. Finally, a team of five\nM.P.'s, Mr. John Hall (Con.),\nMr. John Jennings (Con.), Dr. H. King (Lab.), Mr. Fred Mulley\n(Lab.), and Mr. Donald Wade\n(Lib.), and in the House of Lords,\nthe Rt. Hon. Lord Longford, all\nof whom are Honorary VicePresidents of the Union, assist it\nin countless ways, particularly by\ncontacting Ministers personally,\nasking questions in Parliament\nand occasionally initiating de-bates.\nNow it is argued by those\nagainst NUS that we have direct\ninfluence. The Rector, for in-stance, is on the Robbins Committee. In the past, in cases involving individual students. IC\nUnion brought pressure to bear\nand raised the matter successfully\nin Parliament. In the past, the\nUGC has visited the College, and\nmet the Union Executive to get its\nviews on grants, etc. In NUS we\nwould be lost in the enormous\nnumbers; our seven delegates are\nhardly likely to have any great\neffect in an NUS Council of\nseveral hundred other delegates.\nIn any case, in conferences\nwhere 242 motions are on the\nagenda, to be dealt within the\nspace of 23 hours, it is doubtful\nif anything useful can be\nachieved. Why not keep our\nidentity ; by not dissolving in the\nvast body of NUS. our voice will\nsurely be heard more distinctly.\nIC cannot possibly lobby the\nGovernment to the extent and\nwith the same intensity as NUS ;\nit is not the main function of\nICU, but it is the function of\nNUS. At best, we can help in\nindividual cases. And vet. our\nUnion members do benefit (as in\nthe case of Insurance payments)\ndue to the efforts of NUS, and\nwill continue to benefit.\nNUS has many international\nactivities. \" A considerable\namount of the Executive's time is\ntaken up by the question of world\nstudent unit v\" says the NUS\nhandbook. This provides a number of arguments against NUS.\nwhich last year sent delegations\nto Morocco, Norway, Turkev,\nCevlon. Peru, Nigeria, Denmark,\nSwitzerland. Italy, France.

This\nis to enable us to meet them and\nto introduce them to our friends.\nThey are quite normal and approachable\u2014in fact quite human!\nDo try to get a chance to meet\nthem. Apart from these informal opportunities of meeting,\ntwo of the friars will be speaking\nat the GENERAL STUDIES on\nthe subject of \" On Being a Christian To-day.\" Both these\nfriars\u2014Fr. Dennis Marsh, S. S.F., and Fr Hugh, S. S.F., are distinguished academics as well as able\ndirectors in the spiritual life. An opportunity to hear them should\nnot be missed. These General\nStudies are on Tuesday, February\nt5h, and Thursday, February\n7th, and will take place in Room\n254, Chem. Eng. Building. On\nMonday, February 4th, a talk on\nthe \" Franciscan Life,\" and on\nFriday, February 8th, a Forum\nwill be held in Aero Building,\nRoom 254.\nEvery morning at 8.30 a service of holy communion will be\nheld in the concert hall. On\nThursday, February 7th, a SUNG\nEUCHARIST will be celebrated\nby the Bishop of Kensington,\nduring which he will also ba pti sea student of the Royal College\nof Music and confirm her and live\nmen from Imperial. The service\nwill take place in St. Augustine's Church, Queen's Gate, S.W.7, which is the University church\nfor the area. A gala party will\nfollow the service and this will be\nheld in the Imperial College\nSnack Bar.\nThe Snack Bar will also be the\nsetting for the three evening talks\non \" The Faith \" which will be\ngiven on the Monday, Tuesday,'\nWednesday of the week. They\nwill begin at 8.0 p.m. and be over\nby 9.0 p.m. They will be given\nby the leader of the campaign,\nFr. Bernard, S. S.F. Fr. Bernard will also preach on\nboth Sundays of the week. On\nboth Sundays the services in St.\nAugustine's will be a SUNG EUCHARIST at 9.0 a.m. and\nEVENSONG and SERMON at\n7.30 p.m. I have tried to give an outline\nof the campaign and I know from\nall I have come to expect from\nyou that you will give our visitors\na great welcome and will work\nhard to make their stay among us\na worthwhile one.\nEvery good wish.\nFATHER IVOR.\nSpannerama\nNow that we are approaching\nHalf Session, this is an appropriate time to review the activities of the Union over the last\nfour months. The six Freshers\nDinners, that is including the one\ntaken over from Master Harris,\nset the scene for a term full of\nactivity and surprises.\nMitch, by permission of unknown Guildsmen, appeared at\nthe first; and at the second,\nTheta appeared too, having been\npresented to us a few days earlier\nby its negligent keepers. It is\nmany years since one college has\nbeen custodian of all three mascots\u2014yet another record ! The\n300 or so at the second meeting\nmust remember Harriss' feebly\nattempted song and dance required of him to secure the return of his Broom Handle and\nLavatory Ball Cock.\nIn the more classically sporting\nsphere, Guilds has further\nshown its prowess in rowing,\nswimming and cross country run-ning. Morphy Day was a clean\nsweep, both the Morphy and\nLowry pots have been won and\nthanks to the hard fought support of all those on the towpath\nChris Liddle kept his trousers.\nUnder his direction the Battle of\nthe Bags was also clinched.\nThe Swimming Gale too demonstrated the present supremacy\nof the college for the swimming\nand polo were yet again won out-right. One defeat we must record however is the Presidents'\nRace. A Chandmal Ind. Imp.\nclad only in a brief swimming\ncostume scored a tactical success\nover Chris who had brought\nalong Mae West, air bed, paddle\nand rope\u2014better luck next time,\nOld Man.\nAlmost at the end of term the\nCross Country Club chalked up\nsuccess against Mines and R.C.S. Term ended in the same way\nas it probably started for most\u2014\nwith a drink ! Some 30 or so\nrevellers set off by tube for the\nU.L. Bar armed perchance with\na Charity Carnival collecting box.\nThe tubes were an ideal location\nfor carol singing, to the involuntary audience a couple of bob\nwas a cheap silence. By near to\nclosing time the choir had returned to Knightsbridge with over\n\u00a36 crammed, a worthy effort.\nSuch a successful term cannot\nbe explained away by the saying\n\" Guilds is much the largest College.\" The reason is much more\nfundamental for as the Dean has\nsaid, Guilds is superior to the\nother colleges.\nThe present crest of the wave\nis not maintained by relying on\npast successes but by the very\npositive contribution being made\nby many keen Guildsmen led by\nthe President. Chris's enthusiasm\nand sincerity is felt by all those\nactive in his Union.\nAN\nOPEN\nINVITATION\nThe idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU \u2014 and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE\n\n"

The National Union in\nBritain is a member of the International Students' Conference\nwhich was formed in opposition\nto the Communist dominated IUS.\nNUS supports students in their\ncampaign against apartheid in\nSouth Africa, it supported the\nraising of funds for Hungarian\nstudent refugees, it has sent food\nand clothing to Algeria. A cy clo styled announcement was received recently in the Union, sent\nby the Coordinating Secretariat\nof National Unions. This was a four page diatribe against the\nconstitution of Southern Rhodesia\n(put out by the Zimbawe Students Union, 4, Inverness Terrace, London, W.2). NUS also\nsupport motions like that of solidarity with Puerto Rican stu-dents.\nShould our Union, as members\nof NUS, be implicated in the\nactions and resolutions of a conference we have hardly any\nchance of influencing ? The public image of IC will not be\naffected, in the opinion of the\npro-NUS faction, because the\npublic don't even know that at\nthe moment we are not members.\nAnother point to be raised is\nthe composition of NUS. Since\nthis has a heavy Tech. College\nmembership, it is not certain that\nall their actions would be of benefit to University students. Last\nyear, NUS tried to force the Universities to refuse a gift of\n\u00a310,000 from the Vice-Chan-,\ncell or for University sport, on the\ngrounds that a similar subsidy\nshould have been made to the\nTraining Colleges.

In the balance\nsheet of the Accounts dated 31st December, 1961, the figures are\n\u00a328,000 out of \u00a3354,000. A healthy surplus is being built up,\nand the financial side of NUS\nlooks good, with an annual income of \u00a3354,000 made up of\naffiliation fees (about 50 per\ncent.), donations, trusts, etc., NUS\naccounts, contrary to rumours,\nare published and are freely avail-able.\nIn spite of the g6od grace of\nthe Editor who gave me a carte\nblanche for this article (and a big\none at that), I could not possibly\ndiscuss all the salient arguments\nfor and against: debating tournaI\nMain\nAdministration\nFinance\nMembership\nI Secretariat\nVisits to\ncolleges\nInternational\naffairs\nExecutive\ncorrespondence\nEducation &\nWelfare\nGrants\nAccommodatior\nSafety\nExpansion of\nHigher\nEducation\nI Events &\nVacation Work\nDrama\nFestival\nDebates\nTournament\nVacation jobs\nConference\norganisation\nWork and\nFarm Camps\nConcessions\nSummer School\nTravel\nIndividual and\nparty travel\nSpecial tours\nCharter flights\nExchange\nprogramme\nI Publications\n'Student News\"\n\"Choosing a Career\"\n\"Student Guide\nto London\"\nOther\npublications\nPress relations\nI Hostel\nOvernight\naccommodation\nin London\nCARS, TRUCKS AND* TRACTORS occupy pride of place among Britain's exports.

Individual members of NUS get\ncertain concessions on some art i cles. Barring a few firms, any\nIC Union member could get the\nsame concessions (this fact should\nhave no bearing on which way\nyou vote\u2014you should decide as\na member of ICU not as John\nSmith). There is no doubt whatsoever that the NUS travel department is first rate and will\nsave you an appreciable amount\nshould you decide to travel\nabroad. It is possible to join as\nan individual member for the\nsum of 15/-.\nThe more relevant argument\nrevolves around the point that if\nwe join, the ICU will have to\nfind a\" spare \" \u00a3300. Where will\nthis money come from and at\nwhat cost ? \u00a3300 represent 2\\\nper cent, of our income. Since\nthe Union fees cannot be raised\nfor some years to corne, this\nmoney must either come out of\nreserves (\u00a38,000 not counting the\nBookstall reserves), or by cutting\nthe grants to the clubs, or by cutting out the Presidents' Ball. The\nUnion should appreciate just\nwhat joining means to us financially, and the proposer s should\nmake it quite clear from where\nthe money is coming.\nAs for the finances of the NUS\nment s, drama, Festival, summer\ncamps and jobs, all well known\nto us.\nI have given you some facts, all\nchecked and rechecked, which\nseem to me to be the most im-port ant. No doubt you will hear\nthese and others at the Union\nMeeting. The decision will be\nyours, gentlemen. 1 feel strongly\nthat, given the facts, the Union\nmeeting is the best judge of what\nis best for this Union. Collective\njudgment is the basis of demo-c racy, and I am in favour of it.\nI have been pressed to \"give a lead \" by committing myself but\nhave refused to do so because as\nPresident, one does not come\nacross enough evidence to decide\nthe issue clearly. This is borne\nout by the fact that I personally\nknow two men, ex-Presidents of\nICU who hold diametrically opposite views on this subject.\nYour decision will be based on\nyour attitude to things, material\nand moral, and this is after all a very personal thing.\nOne final word. We are very\ngrateful to the RGS for giving us\nthe use of their Hall.

It may be more ex-pensive, but the snow is more\nski-able, the weather more\namenable, the variety of ski runs\npractically endless, and the night\nlife is gorgeous.\nSeveral years ago in Wengen,\nSwitzerland, somebody founded a club nick-named \"D.H. O.\"i.e., the \"Down Hill Only\" Club.\nWe may not be members, but we\ndo ski the same way, ski-ing\ndownhill and using the efficient\nlifts back to the top again. This is\nwhere Hampstead Heath fails\nmiserably. There is little pleasure in ski-ing, if after two minutes gently shu s sing, you have to\nspend twenty minutes trudging\nback to the top of the slope.\nApart from anything else, it'sh austin g. The IC Winter Ski-ing party to\nLeysin in Switzerland returned\nfrom there on January 7th, having departed from London just\nafter Christmas. Although the\nweather was dull for mos\u00a3 of the\ntime, the snow conditions were\ngood for the duration of our\nstay. Our experts had a good selection of lifts and runs to choose\nfrom, and our novices progressed\nsteadily on the nursery slopes.\nOne of them even managed to\nbreak a ski while standing still!\nJust as well, perhaps, that he\ndidn't graduate to class 2, where\nthey teach you to move.\nAt one of the club meetings\nthis term, we shall be showing\nour photos and colour slides of\nthis trip to Switzerland.\nThe Club is at present organising a second party, to Zurs in\nthe Austrian Arlberg at Easter.\nMore details are available on the\nnotice boards outside the Concert Hall.

Satire at the Establishment is not designed primarily\nto poke fun at public figures, but\nrather tp dissect present-day\nsociety, and to ask \" why,\" when\nthe foundations of this are found\nto be non-existent. To any student who is not afraid of joining\nan audience of about sixty and\ncompanions are parodied before\nhim, the Establishment is re com mended. An excellent three-course dinner can be had for\nabout 20/- and drinks are at reasonable prices.

In stark\nbut comfortable surroundings\nthere is food, drink, dancing, to\nfirst class modern jazz, flowing,\nclear, well-nigh unequalled in\nLondon.\nDress at the Establishment is\nas varied as its membership. One\nof its many attractions is the opportunity to observe the sort of\npeople that we lack at IC, university students, young executives,\ntired businessmen, all merging\ninto the one Establishment type-cynical, yes, but at the same\ntime, warm and friendly.
