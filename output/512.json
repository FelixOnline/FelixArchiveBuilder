Home improvements and labour saving feature strongly with furniture, design and decor.\nThere are sections devoted to\ngardening, leisure, food and domestic\nequipment plus exhibition houses, one\nof which has rooms selected from those of\ni av our it eTV stars such as Ernie Wise and Bruce Forsyth. Probably most useful (if you have any money left) is a section devoted to\ninvestment etc. Its good to see all the big savers in a confined space and provides\nan excellent opportunity to 'shop\naround*. Labour saving inventions of special\nnote include a vacuum cleaner attachment to enable it to remove all the\nthings it removes anyway only more efficiently: a device to keep gas cookers\nclean and a rope that doesn t need knots.\nA view of 'Acorn Magna' with cricket on the common\nGo and visit Acorn Magna, The National Trust Model Village. It's truly amazing, and so realistic to anyone who has lived in a village. Each of the\nbuildings is modelled on somewhere in this country and yet they all blend together so that you' d never know.

    "content": "Page 2\nSir, - I would like to make a few\npoints on some of the ideas going\naround IC at the moment; most of\nthese viewpoints are not new to\nthe College, but they all seem to\nbe more and more prevalent at\npresent.\nIt seems that many IC students\nclaim that human existence is\nunrelated to any permanent,\nchange less standards; in fact, I think they mean that no such\nstandards exist at all, but rather\nthat everything is based on the\nchangeable beliefs and practices\nof society. However, I don't believe that these people have\nreally thought out what this\nmeans: one inevitable cons e que n ce, for example, is that the whole\nargument about Human Rights\nbecomes a nonsense. It means that\nwe can only argue that, since our\n'Western' governments think it's rather nice for people to have lots\nof freedoms, then we should all try\nto force this bright idea onto the\nnasty Russians, Chileans, etc!\nNow I don't believe this is what\npeople mean when they talk\nabout Human Rights: they are\nreferring to the intrinsic, inalienable rights of all human beings, rights which exist without\nreference to the conditions under\nwhich anyone might be living. It's worth adding here that these\nRights are challenged by all of us\nin some way of other, because it is\nvery costly to give everybody\nRights - but that doesn't mean it is\ngood to oppress the weak to\nreduce this cost to ourselves!\nAnother idea floating around is\nthat human beings are quite\nunrestricted to do whatever they\nwant, any moral code being more\na matter of personal convenience\nthan of lasting utility. But this\nview is quite unworkable in\npractice. For example, men and\nwomen can do many things that\nare positively harmful to others -e.g. stabbing passers-by to death\nfor the sake of it; or two near\nblood-relations can conceive a child by having intercourse,\nthereby storing up almost certain\ntrouble for themselves, the child\nand for society as a whole, just by\nexercising their ability to commit\nincest.\nIf anyone would like to live in a society where no rules outlawing\nsuch anti-social behaviour, then\nthey are unusual to say the least!\nWe need to have a certain amount\nof laws to protect individuals and\nsociety - though, of course, people\nwill generally disagree on how\nextensive such legislation should\nbe. Some laws will have to extend\ninto the privacy of individuals (it\nwould be quite impossible to\nprove many offences if courts\ncould not demand a witness to\nreveal the contents of a secret\nconversation, etc.) - but this need\nshould be assessed in terms of the\ncost to individuals and to society\nas a whole.\nJust because men and women\nare constructed( physically, mentally and spiritually) so that\nthey can utilise their resources in\ndifferent (i.e. conflicting) ways\ndoes not mean that one of those\nways is not better than all the rest.\nThe Welfare State can be used or\nabused, but it was clearly\nintended to be used properly and\nso bring great relief to all sections\nof the community. It is certain\nthat many people are out to grab\nwhat they can , more than their\nfair share, and so take away from\nthose in greater need. You could\nsay such an attitude is just as good\nas everyone accepting their fair\nshare, but such an attitude will\ndemolish the whole concept of the\nWelfare State anyway!\nMany people would say (in so\nmany words) that mankind is a \"cosmic accident\". This implies\nthat human existence, having\nbegun by accident, must continue\nin a like manner. Thus it would\nseem foolish to try to do anything\ndefinite (i.e. deliberately) since all\nyour actions must necessarily be\naccidental! However, I don't think many final-year students\nare willing to accept this - as if\nmeans that their attempts at\nrevision and their success or\nfailure in the exams are merely\naccidents! Well, I know I'm not\nthe world's ideal student, but\neven I hope to be able to answer\nquestions better if I bother to do\nmore revision - don't you!\nNow, all these comments are\nbased on a simple consideration of\nexperience of human life. It has\nnot been necessary to go into any\nobscure system of philosophy or\nbeliefs. As it happens, I have\npersonally applied these attitudes\nto a system that includes all of\nthem; I do not believe that it is\npossible to prove (scientifically or\nphilosophically) every aspect of\nmy faith from first principles\n(otherwise I wouldn't be believing\nin anything, I'd just be accepting\na set of facts) but I do believe that\nit's very easy to justify my faith, in\nterms of human experience and\nconditions and the need for a foolproof solution to our problems. Of course, I often have my doubts\nabout something or other; but I have yet to be dissatisfied with\nany of the reassurances I have\nfound in response to my doubts;\nand it would seem that there are\nalways answers to my questions\n( although I don't often understand much about these,\nbecause, like the rest of humanity\n- probably more so - I tend to be\nrather thick: if I hadn't said it, you\nwould have!).\nSo what is this system of faith\nthat I hold to be true? - it is\ncentred around one man, a carpenter by trade, whose life so\nfascinates me that I have stared\nfor a long time at it. There is\nnothing I have found to regret in\nthis man: there is everything I have found that is good, pure and\nattractive. The claims made by\nthis man make it very difficult to\nignore him even if you think he\nwas mad , then it's a good idea to\nthink out some reasons, just in\ncase you get attracted to the\nunusual things he claimed to be\nable to offer!\nSo, why not accept the\nchallenge to take another look at\nthe man I have mentioned, just in\ncase there might be something of\nvalue for your life? (His name is\nJesus of Nazareth, and he has\nquite a few followers, even in IC!)\nYours sincerely,\nTony Leech\nMaterials Science 111\nP.S. As I didn't mention a certain\nBook even once, this letter may\nprove of especial interest to y tur readers!\nDear Sir. - Please allow me to\nreply to the letter by Kirsten Pratt\nin last week's FELIX. The letter refers to menstrual\nextraction in terms which make it\nseem preferable to a 'normal'\nabortion. It is not. An abortion is\nthe killing of an unborn child,\nhowever it is executed and\nwhether the time interval from\nconception is one day, one week\nor one month. When a woman\nuses this method of abortion, she\nknows what she is doing: if she is\npregnant she is performing an\nabortion, killing her child. The\nmajor difference from a 'normal'\nabortion is that with \"heads being\nthrown in buckets of bits of bodies\" the\nend result is more obvious.\nKirsten Pratt says that \"80% of\nabortions take place before 12 weeks,\nwhen the baby is about 3\" long with its\nknees bent up\". As well as knees\nbent up the baby also has easily\ndistinguishable toes, fingers, ears\netc. Its appearance is little\ndifferent from that of a new-born\nbaby; in fact it resembles the newborn baby more than the newborn baby resembles an adult.\nThe fact that an unborn baby is\nless developed than an adult is no\nargument in favour of abortion, it\nmerely emphasises the fact that\nlife, from conception to death, is a continuous process of change.\nConcerning further points in\nthe letter, the issue is not one of\nforcing a woman to have a child\nor of denying a woman the right\nto decide whether or not she has a child. In all but a very small\nminority of instances the woman\nhas chosen to take the risk. By the\ntime she is pregnant, the woman\nhas exercised her choice; she and\nthe father are fully responsible for\nthe life in her womb, and abortion\nis simply an attempt at negating\nthat responsibility, the easy way\nout. The existence of such an\nescape route does not mean that it\nshould be used. Instead, assistance must be given the\nwoman in all ways possible to help\nher cope with pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood. The\nfather must be made to face his\nresponsibilities to mother and\nchild. If after its birth, the mother\ndecides that she cannot bring up\nthe baby then there are many\nchildless couples who would be\ndelighted to be able to adopt it.\nFor every child available for\nadoption there are about 20\nwould-be adoptive parents.\nOn the subject of rape, a terrible crime of violence has been\ncommitted against the woman\nwho may, as a result, be pregnant.\nUnfortunately, the act of rape\ncannot be undone; there is no use\npretending that it can, even to a slight degree. It is sometimes\nargued that an abortion can\nreduce the trauma by relieving\nthe woman of a constant reminder\nof the horrible event. However, to\ndo this involves the killing of one\nperson. From another point of\nview, abortion is known to be a traumatic experience in many\ncases, and it may add to the\nwoman's suffering. It also\nincreases the risk of any further\nchildren the woman may have of\nbeing born deformed. The major\npoint I would make, however, is\nthat noone has the right to deny\nthat child a continued existence.\nIt is the prevention of rape and the\ncare, consideration and acceptance which must be given a woman who has been raped that\nare important. Fortunately, rape\nis rare and conception from it\neven rarer.\nAbortion should be seen as the\nkilling of an innocent human being for the convenience of\nothers. The emphasis should be\non lessening the apparent inconvenience caused by the\nchild: on removing the prejudice\nagainst unmarried mothers, the\nhandicapped and the illegitimate;\non providing the assistance,\nfinancial or otherwise, that an\nunmarried (or unwilling) mother\n(or father) may need; on improving facilities and care for\nthe handicapped; on preventing\nrape; on bringing children into a society where they are all equally\naccepted, loved and educated and\nwhere none of them are made to\nfeel unwanted. Achieving such\nends will never be easy, but a question is not answered by\nrubbing it out. Abortion is the\neasy way out, for parents and\nsociety: it is not the right way.\nYours sincerely,\nSean Kelly\n(Chemistry 1)\nDear Sir, - I would like to make a comment on the editorial of the\n'mourning cloud'. May I point\nout that since Jan Czernuska is\nnon-existent, his 'threat to the\nfabric of our society' is probably\nalso non-existent.\nI therefore feel that the editor\ncould spend his and his readers'\ntime on more worthwhile topics.\nYours,\nJan Czernuszka\n\n"

A target of a further 11 goals was set and\nthe fourths started again in\nmean mood, searching for\nmore goals.\nGoals were flowing freely\nuntil O 'Kelly decided that he\nwanted a hat-trick and that he\nwasn't going to pass to\nanyone until he got it. There\nthen followed a long period of\nmissed chances until finally\nhe put his third goal away.\nGoalkeeper Barry Witts was\nswitched with two-goal hero\nSteve Veats and rose to the\noutfield challenge by scoring\na goal from a solo run starting\nin his own half of the field.\nSomewhere in between,\nJames Rowley had managed\nto amass 5 goals and Steve\nMarten an incredible 6! Neil\nCatford also finished off his\ndebut hat-trick and the score\nwas 22-0 when we realised\nthat all four defenders had\nfailed to score. Hard man Bill\nCaffyn (who before the match\nhad cast doubts on our ability\nto win - well done Bill!) made\nhis way to a spot 30 yards from\nthe QE C goal and waited for\nthe ball. The QE C defence,\nnot wishing to incur his wrath,\npassed the ball to him and he\nthundered the ball into the top corner of the net for the 23rd and best taken goal of the\ngame. Phil Lakin stole in for\nthe all-important 24th and\nsoon after, the ref blew the\nfinal whistle.\nIt should be pointed out that\nthe 2 non-scoring defenders-Giles Brereton and Neil Morris\n- had decided that it would be\ntoo embarrassing to score\nonly one goal so they decided\nnot to bother and were\ncontent to contemplate the\nmeaning of life for most of the\nmatch.\nThis is believed to be by far\nthe biggest league victory in\nUL U history so well done IC IV\nfor winning their own place in\nthe annals of UL U soccer.\nThe fourths would also like to\npoint out that in achieving this result they scored one goal\nevery four minutes which\ndisproves a theory by'the old\nman of football' John Healy\nand his right hand man poet-Laureate Al Cable that no IC\nIV player could run the length\nof the pitch in less than five\nminutes.\nScorers: Steve Marten (6),\nJames Rowley (5), Paddy\nO 'Kelly (3), Neil Catford (3),\nDave Higgs (2), Steve Veats\n(2), Phil Lakin (1), Bill Caffyn\n(1), Barry Witts (1).\nTeam: Witts, Morris, Caffyn,\nVeats, Lakin, Brereton, Higgs,\nCatford, O 'Kelly, Marten,\nRowley.\nIC 1st XI 2\nGOLDSMITHS 0\nIC went into this game\nneeding a win to keep up their\nchallenge for the premier division title and this was\nexpected to be a difficult\ngame. Goldsmith's are also\nwell placed in the league and on Saturday (10th March) contest the cup final with\nRH C. IC took some time to settle but\nmanaged to withstand Gold smith's early attacks. After about\nhalf an hour the game appeared\nto be stagnating with neither side\ngetting the upper hand. Then Graham Rick ard received the\nball on the left wing, j inked past a couple of Goldsmiths' defenders\nI.C. WIN IN FINAL\nI.C. Ist 23\nGUY'S HOSP. 1st9I.C. Rugby travelled to the U.L. U. ground at Mot spur Park to\ntake on Guy's in the Final of the Gutteridge Plate Competition\nand after a mediocre performance emerged clear winners by\nthe above score line. On inspecting the pitch we were amazed to find that the lines had\nbeen laid down over the lines of a football pitch. This left criss-crosses of\nwhite chalk everywhere and particularly-bad was the tr\\ line where two\nlines ran parallel one yard apart making it difficult to know whit h was\nthe correct line. This was to play quite a role in the match.\nI.C. began disastrously - being it looked as if I.C. were going to\n6 - 0 down within five minutes but\nmanaged to pull things together\nsomewhat after Dave Lilley had scored an opportunist try following their_ full back fumbling\na chip by Ronnie Howard. This\nwas quickly followed by a penalty\ngoal from the boot of Maurice Cotter.\nNow that I.C. were in the lead\nfor the first time they produced\nsome of the best play seen in the\nmatch. This culminated in a fine\nteam try finished off by Peter\nGoring after some excellent back\nup play. Before this Eddy Budgen\nhad put over a really 'monster'\ndrop goal.\nThe second half saw Guy's immediately increase their score\nwith a penalty kick and for a time\ncrack.\nThis was not to be because a further try and conversion by\nCotter elevated the score beyond\nGuy's reach. This was another\ngood try with a dummy scissors\nputting John Chanceller through\nand leaving Cotter to finish off.\nJust after this Maurice added\nanother penalty to notch up the\nabove total.\nHowever, the score would have\nbeen more if yours truly had not\ndowned the ball on the soccer line\nwhen seemingly through to an easy try.\nThanks very much to all those\nwho came along to support us, by\nthe way!\nS. Townsend before hammering a superb shot\ninto the roof of the net . IC defended this lead well throughout the second half,\noccasionally threatening to\nextend their lead with quick,\nincisive moves. Towards the end\nof the game the pressure on the IC goal began to mount with\nGoldsmiths' gaining a number of\nfree-kicks with the at ric s that\nreally warranted Oscar nomination s.IC defended bravely, Tsoukkas making two\nparticularly noteworthy saves,\nbut in the last five minutes they\nconceded a penalty when Rutty\nwas adjudged to have fouled an\nopposing forward. However Goldsmiths' were incapable of\nconverting even this opportunity\ninto a goal, and in the dying\nminutes of the game Richard added IC's second goal with\nanother terrific shot.\nTeam: Tsoukkas, Rutty, Reeve,\nhenri ck, Price, Clarke, Black,\nJohnson, K. McPhail, Kenrick,\nBrindle.\nIC 1st XI\nUCH 0\nIC overcame their recent\nloss of three points to RH C in a double-header (notice how\ndefeats are never reported),\nwith a good win over a rather\npoor hospital side. This result\nleaves them with an outside\nchance of winning the U.L. league, though it is now\nessential to win the remaining games. Having already defeated this team 5 -1 earlier this season IC were\nnot expecting too much difficulty and this over confidence showed in the early\npart of the game.\nSome good moves were put\ntogether from tbe start with Rutty\nattempting to score by booting\nboth ball and goalkeeper into the\nnet. UCH came back well and Tsoukkas had to make an\nextrovert diving save to push\naway a shot from the UCH centre\nforward. IC's early confidence\nbegan to wane as the game moved\non with no score in their favour.\nHowever after half-time the game\nchanged completely as the IC players realised they now had the\nwind at their backs (not a reference to Phil Brindle's turd\nfetish). It was not long before the\nfirst goal went in as Paver,\nremembering at last to keep his\nhead down when he shoots, rifled\nhome a low, hard shot to give the\nUCH keeper no chance. After this\nfirst goal the opposition folded up\nand IC began lo play with a lot\nmore confidence. Further goals\ncame from Brindle (2) and Johnson, though the final score\nshould certainly have been higher\nthan 4-0.\nTeam: Tsoukkas; Rutty, Reeve,\nPaver, Kenrick, Black, Johnson,\nDavies, Rickard, Brindle, Stevenson.\n\n"

It is also useful\nif he is a competent writer and is familiar with\nmany of the personalities of Union and\nCollege.\nI believe DAVID CRABBE fulfills these\ncriteria far better than any other candidate.\nIn his three years at Imperial, he has been\nFELIX News Editor (1976 - 77), last year's IC Union Handbook Editor (which made full\nuse of the new equipment, was the biggest\nyet. and had the most inventive designs of any\nrecent Union Handbook) and is1 currently\nFELIX Business Manager (which involves\nmaking sure FELIX doesn't overspend).\nDavid has also attended Council and UG M's and is a member of Publications Board. He has not only experience and proven ability,\nbut ideas, inventiveness arj d dedication. I am\nabsolutely certain that\nIT'S BETTER TO VOTE FOR CRABBE Duncan Suss\nFELIX Editor 1977-78.\nHon. Sec.\nCANDIDATE: Roger Stotesbury\nPROPOSER: Jo Armitage\nI'm keen to see next year a well organised,\neffective and widely supported Union. It is\nthe role of our Union to look after our\nwelfare, interests and to provide the\nopportunity lor an active social life.\nThis comes down to a concern lor each\nindividual and what each of us looks for in\nour years here. I sec the Hon. See's role as\none of two-way communication and\norganisation. Hence as well as coordinating\nUnion Affairs he should be approachable and\nsocially active. He must be on hand to carry\nout the daily work required in the office but\nalso anxious to continually widen the scope\nand outlook of the Union. The know ledge I have gained as this year's ICU Academic Affairs Officer will be\ninvaluable. Throughout I have shown the\nsense of purpose and personal involvement\nneeded to get results. As my work dealt with\nall areas of College I'm also aware of the\ndependence on communication. My two\nyears here have given me the belief that our\nExec, must be personally interested and\nconcerned in all aspects of college life. As\neditor of the Alternative Prospectus I 've\nshown I'm capable of that!\nTwo points! Publicity for UG M's must go\nhand in hand with encouraging everyone 10\nsubmit motions; UG M's must be maa e worth\nattending. Secondly I would take an interest\nin any problems facing Clubs and Societies\noffering assistance where ever possible.\nWhat I can oiler as Hon. Sec. is based on a clear insight of what the job entails. 1'hus, I know very well of the routine tasks and the\ndedication needed to carry them out\nefficiently with minimal fuss. I have the\nexperience, initiative and enthusiasm to do\nthe job well.\nRoger Stotesbury.\n\n"

    "content": "Page6 REVIEWS I \"The Deer hunter\" (X, director Michael\nCimino) is such a film that its theme is\nestablished in its opening shot. A massive\njuggernaut thunders past the camera out of\nshot; in the background are the blast furnaces\nof a Pennsylvanian steel mill. As surely as the\njuggernaut arrives so will the effects of\nVietnam, and not just on those who are\nenlisted.\nRobert de Niro plays Michael, who along\nwith close friends Nick and Stephen, is\nscheduled for a tour of duty of Vietnam.\nBefore they leave their loves and a community steeped in ethnic solidarity and\ncom rad ship, they go on one last deer hunt\ntogether. Michael emerges as the leader, hard\nstubborn and rational. \"One shot is what it's all about; the deer has to be taken with one\nshot\". The piano playing afterwards, as they\nrelax is slowly but surely drowned by the\nsound of helicopter blades. Then in a marvellous edit we cut to the horrors of war\nand the waste of human life.\nErnest Hemingway wrote in his\nintroduction to the anthology 'Men at War' the\nfollowing \"...when you have read this you will\nknow that there are no worse things to be\ngone through than men have not been,\nthrough before\". The three, now reunited,\nRobert de Nero as Michael\nswap the horrors of war for the horrors of a Viet Cong prisoner camp. With ry th mic editing of close-ups, a game of Russian\nRoulette is performed; The prisoners as\npawns and the captors as gamblers. The\nbarrel is spun and clasped. With one bullet in\nthe gun the prisoner holds it up to his temple.\nIf it goes off, you witness an explosion and the\nripping apart of the human head. Such is the\nfilm-powerful and direct.\nThis game is the underlying thread\nthroughout - culminating in Michael trying to\nsave Nick. In a chaotic Saigon, he faces Nick\nacross the other side of the table having\nbought his way into the game. 'Remember\nNick, is this what you really want? It only\ntakes one bullet, remember Deer Hunting'.\nIt is no coincidence: whilst we witness a gun firing into a temple, it is war that is\ndestroying the minds of the young men.\nThe Deer Hunter' is about the way war\naffects the individual and changes his life.\nBack home, Michael, in the second deer hunt\nand the splendour of the scenery, cannot\neven bring himself to kill the deer. Meryl\nStreep, already widely praised for her port r ali of Nick's girl friend Linda, sums everything up\nwhen she says 'Did you ever think it would\nturn out like this?'\nMichael in the horrors of Vietnam\nDirector Michael Cimino, this being only\nhis second venture as writer-director of a major motion picture, gives usa scope of time\nand place. Interlaced is a steel mill town, with\na stark skyline that juts up from the wooded\nhills, and the battlefield of Vietnam. Only\nMichael survives intact from the horrors,\npulling together the strands of his life.\nRobert de Niro, as the hard-living/hard-working steel worker achieves a brilliant\nperformance. No other actor goes into such\nmeticulous detail to capture a character. Also\noutstanding are Christopher Walkin, as Nick\nwho loses contact with his background,\nMeryl Streep who made her film debut in\n'Julia' , and John Savage who plays Steven:\n'It has nothing to do with whether we should\nor should not have been in Vietnam. It's just\nabout guys who are touched by War'.\nThe film is a sad indictment for the human\nrace but a tribute to the courage of the\nindividual. Nick tells Michael before they\nleave 'Don't leave me over there' and he\ndidn't: except that Nick was dead. A destroyed mind was blown away by one shot-that's what it's all about.\nRoger Stotesbury\nTENPIN BOWLING\nTHE AlTO SOUTHAMPTON After spending a couple of weeks\nstruggling to arrange a team of nine to\nbowl at Southampton last weekend,.\nhectic activity at the last minute (OK\nI'm exaggerating) meant that two\nteams travelled down on Saturday. Was\nit worth the journey and all the hassles?\nOverall, yes, with the first team coming\naway with a few trophies and some\ngood individual performances.\nThe Southampton Trios were based on\nteams of nine; six men and three ladies.\nEvery one bowled one series in either a men's or ladies' trio and then another series in a mixed trio (two men and one lady). Late\nentrants (ourselves) and late arrivals (not us\nfor a change) made lane allocations difficult\nfor the organizers, but on the whole they\ncoped well, despite numerous machine\nbreakdowns and stoppages.\nMost of the London teams found problems\nin adapting to the lanes at Bitterne. This is a common handicap for those who generally\nbowl at Tolworth, where the conditons on the\nlanes are different from just about every other\ncentre in Britain. In particular, Edgar Fung took a couple of games to control his hook and\nfind a good line, rolling a74 first game. It was\nnot until the sixth and final game that Tubby Woo, with a230, and Brian Mac Go wan, with a personal best 226, reached their best;\nwith Edmond Ng's tournament high-game of\n235, London had the best three individual\ngames of the tournament, an excellent\nachievement.\nThe team bowling was more disappointing, apart from the Al team\nwinning the men's trios section convincingly.\nThe team of Edmond Ng, with a588 series,\nAlbert Wong, and Tubby Woo, with 533,\nwell deserved their victory, emphasising the\nstrength of London's first team. Edmond Ng's588 series was the second best of the day,\nbut an inconsistent second series, including a99 game, took away any hopes of victory in\nthe men's tournament average competition.\nHowever Tubby Woo, with a fine 557, giving\na tournament average of 182 came second,\nthe winner averaging 189.\nThe uneven team bowling brought the\nLondon A team only third place, well behind\nSouthampton and Burnel. The B team came\nninth and last and will refuse to discuss this\nresult with anyone.\nlearns: London A: Edmond .\\~g, Albert Wong,\nTubby Woo, Roland Hsie, Joe ,\\'g, Danny Law,\nIda Eok, Louisa Lau, Ruby Wong.\nTotal pinfall: 8047\nLondon H: Brian MacGowan, Peter Churchyard,\nEdgar Fung, Tim Hillyer, Joe Wong, Jackie\nLadder, Su Tick, EuFu Salavalian, Dela Wong\nTotal pinfall: 6737\nMore good news: in the Excel Championship, the House Championship of\nthe Charrington Bowl, Tolworth, held\nrecently, Tubby Woo came third and Roland Hsie came sixth, two excellent performances.\nThe In t crC CU championship will be held\non Wednesday 21st March and will be run\non a trios basis. Each C CU will have two\nteams, one made up from bowlers in the\nClub, the other from C CU stars. The Club AGM will be held the same day at Tolworth,\nso the minibus will leave a little earlier. More details next week.\n\n"

If you\npay these it won't entitle you to\nunemployment benefit or sickness\nbenefit but they do count towards\nless immediate benefits such as\nMaternity Grant, Widows Benefit, Retirement Pension,\nChild's Special Allowance and\nDeath Grant. If you want to pay\nthem there is a special concession\nfor students (and people in prison)\nin that these contributions can be\npaid any time up to the end of the\nsixth tax year following the year\nyour course (or imprisonment)\nends.\nAnother point worth bearing in\nmind is that it is possible to get the\nbasic pension at the standard rate\ndespite a five year gap in your\ncontribution record and you are\ncredited with contributions for\nthe years in which your 16th,17 th and 18th birthdays fell. So even if\nyou have faith in the continuance\nof civilisation - as-we-know-it for\nlong enough to allow you to get a pension, so long as you don't have\nany more time off during your\nearning life, the fact that your\ncontribution record for your time\nat college isn't fully paid up\nshouldn't materially effect your\nposition.\nAs far as the maternity grant\nand the death grant are concerned, the cost making up\nyour record is likely to exceed the\namount you would get back even\nif you did become eligible for\nthose grants!\nIf you want to go any further\ninto this fascinating topic I 've got\nlots of relevant leaflets up in the\nWelfare Centre but if you decide\nto send the aforementioned letter\nto its rightful destination - the\nwastepaper basket, it is unlikely\nthat you will have to regret it.\nMichael Arthur Welfare Adviser\nUnrest at UL U The University of London Union is going through a stormy time at the\nmoment, with discussions and arguments continuing over a proposed\nnew Constitution.\nAt the moment there are three separate bodies responsible for\nrunning the Union - The Sports Council, The Societies Council and the'\nStudents' Representative Council.\nThe two sabbatical officers are elected by and responsible to the\nAnnual Assembly of all three Councils. Therefore they are accountable\nto a body which only meets once a year, which is rather undemocratic.\nFor several years now, attempts have been made to introduce\nchanges to the Constitution which would make the Union more like\nother Unions, with elected executive and sabbatical officers\nresponsible to one overriding Electoral Body which meets more than\nonce a year!\nTherefore it's been proposed, as a result of much long hard\nbargaining and discussion, that constituent colleges should send\ndelegates to a Union Council which would meet at least 8 times a year,\nand from which the Executive and Officers would be elected. Also, 2\nmembers of the Executive would be nominated from each of the Sports\nand Societies Councils.\nSo far, all progress on changing the constitution has been blocked by\nthe Sports Council who are paranoid that they might lose some of their\npower with the introduction of democracy. However, an emergency\nmeeting of the Assembly of Councils was recently called, and both sides\n(i.e. Sports Council versus the rest) were keyed up for a battle, but due\nto some very bureaucratic bungling and appalling Chairmanship, the\nmeeting had to be adjourned. It's now been called again for Wednesday\n21st March, and I hope that this time (it last coincided with the Rector\nspeaking at Council) we can send our full delegation. Our mandate is\nquite dear, because all that is being proposed is that University Union is\nrun along similar lines to our own Union here at Imperial.\nIt has become a matter of urgency because the new Statutes of the\nUR+vf i \u00abrsi ty allow for student senators for the first time, but we have no\nmeans of electing them at present.\nLooking for Work Next Year?\nThere's still time to stand for the post of External Affairs Officer for\nnext session, so if you're at all interested, then don't hesitate to contact\nme to find out about the (enormous!) amount of work involved.\nMeanwhile, don't forget about the Grants Demonstration today,\nespecially if you're one of the many affected by the means test.\nWe've just taken delivery of another 1000 copies of National Student.\nIf there's not any in your department, then they're outside the FELIX\nofficer\nSheyne Lucock\nExternal Affairs Officer\nMistaken Identity\nA chapter from the everyday life\nof a Union Hack....

Sees student and\nspeaks.\n\"Waiting for the doctor?\"\n\" Mmm\" \"Aren't you something in the\nUnion?\"\n\"Yes...Welfare Officer\"\n\"Don't be silly, you can't be - I 've\nmet Michael Arthur....\"\nThe above situation will\nbecome all too familiar for the\nperson who iS elected as next\nyear's Welfare Officer. For those\nof you who don't know, Michael\nArthur is the \"Welfare Adviser\"\nand as such is a full-time Union\nemployee; the Welfare Officer is\nan elected student post.\nThe Welfare Adviser concerns\nhimself with running the welfare\ncentre (3rd floor Union Building)\nwhere he gives advice and help on\nsuch matters as legal problems,\naccommodation, consumer advice, dentists etc.\nj The Welfare Officer represents\nI.C. students in welfare matters.\nHe checks that the Union and\nCollege Welfare services are\nbeing run correctly and also\nconsiders ways in which they may\nbe improved. The Welfare Officer\nworks closely with the Welfare\nAdviser and so provides him with\nuseful feedback as to the current\nproblems and feelings of the\nstudent body.\nThe job entails: -(1) Sitting on I.C.U. Council (3\nmeetings a term)\n(2) Chairmanship of the Union\nWelfare Cttee. (meets every 2-3\nweeks on a Tuesday lunchtime).\nThis body exists to discuss\ncurrent welfare issues and is a fruitful source of ideas.\n(3) Membership of the following\nCollege Cttees (one meeting of\neach Cttee per term)\nStudent Residence Cttee\nStudent Welfare Cttee\nMedical Services Cttee\nOverseas Students Cttee\nNursery Steering Cttee\nSo if you're thinking of standing\nyou have until 17.00 on Monday.\nThe paper is up in the Union\nLower Lounge for the election at\nthe U GM on Thursday 15th March.\nPersonally I have found the job\nto be fascinating - it's amazing the\nkind of things you find out!\nPaul Davey\nWelfare Officer 1978-1979\nElk Encounters of\nthe Election Kind\nWell folks, the time has almost come to put your mark against the name of the candidate you most prefer for the\nsabbatical officers - and I 'll explain exactly the sort of mark you will be making( At least I hope you'll be making there's no\nneed to vent your sexual frustration on the ballot paper). As I said last week, the voting system used at Imperial is called\nSTV( standing for single transferable vote). Instead of just\nnominating one candidate by an X as is done in general and\nlocal authority election you can place all the candidates in an\norder of preference by (believe it or not) numbers1,2,3 etc.\nThe good thing about this system is that it does not lead to two\ncandidates, who attract support broadly from the same quarters,\n'splitting' their votes and letting a3rd candidate not quite as popular or\nwell qualified get elected, it roughly works like this: The first count sorts\nout the papers into piles of first preferences for the candidates, and if the\nleading candidate has got less than half the votes cast (called the quota),\nthen the last person's votes are reallocated i.e. his second preferences are\nthen taken into account and redistributed among the remaining\ncandidates. This carries on until (a) the leading candidate has got more\nthan half the votes cast, counting second, third preferences etc. or (b) there is only one candidate left. - In both cases that person is elected.\nWell did you understand all that? You're a better person than me if\nyou did. All I can say is that I 've definitely made Hon. Sec. the most\nsexual post there is this year and I will continue to play erotic games\nwith next year's set of Union officers long alter I 've ceased being Hon. Sec.\nNow don't forget - vote Monday or Tuesday - bring your Union Card it's your Union. If you can't be here on Monday or Tuesday i or a good\nreason e.g. job interviews you may vote in advance, come up and see me\nin the Union Office, ravage my body lor a couple of minutes until I cry\n\" no more\" and I 'll see what I can do (even if you don't ravage me).\nCheers,\nMike Elk in P.S. Don't forget the results U GM Thursday15 th March,1 p.m., Great Hall, Election of other Union Officers and spice y sexual games\ninvolving all sorts of bizarre fantasies.\n\n"

His name was\nTiptoes, the laughing gnome.\nTiotoes led a lovely life. He\nmisspent his youth (well, his time\nat IC anyway) by playing snooker\nfrom dawn to dusk. Then, one day,\ntwo devils from the land of\nMaffstoo came into the snooker\nlounge, and made his life a misery.\nWithin moments, the fluky shots\nof one of these tormenters, Rastus\nOdinga Odinga Odinga (who\ncomes from Mauritius, not\n'Mauritious'), and the cheeky\ncomments of the other, UL U Champ, soon made Tiptoes into a festering cripple. No more was he\nthe laughing gnome. Instead, the\nsnooker table became a battle-ground, each pocket being just\nsmall enough to keep him for\namassing big breaks. His language deteriorated. He became short-tempered (though\nwhether he was ever long-tempered is to be queried!)...\nIf you would like to see this\nvicious little dwarf losing his\ntemper (probably at me for writing this article), and you are a member of the snooker club, why\nnot come up on Wed. 14th March\nto the Snooker club's Annual\nGeneral Meeting at 1.00 p.m. in\nthe Union TV Lounge.Nomination\npapers for next year's committee\nare now up in the snooker lounge,\nand will be taken down on Mon.\n12th March at 1 p.m. Rastus Odinga Odinga\nDEBSOC ELECTIONS\nA brief glance at the Union Lower Lounge NoticeBoard will reveal nothing.

The chairman of Debating Society also sits on the\nsocial, cultural and amusements board (SCAB) and gets involved as an 'impartial co-or d in at or' in such things as 'Welfare Day' and ICU events such as last years N.U.S. Debate.

WATER POLO CLUB\nOn Tuesday 20th two I.C. teams turned up\nto play in the ULU League at Malet Street.\nI.C.1 was to play Guys Hospital and I.C.2 was\nto play St. Thomases.\nI.C.1 was the first to play. We got off to a fast start with Philip Mills scoring a goal with a hard shot from the left wing. Guys however,\nwith tight marking and accurate passing,\nwere able to level the score almost\nimmediately. I.C. repeatedly pushed forward,\nbut were foiled by tight marking. In the\nsecond and third quarters, Guys scored\nanother couple of goals after rapidly breaking\nfrom their men. Dave Roberts played well in\ngoal, but had difficulty stopping the \"Cannon\nBall\" shots that were produced by Guys\ncentre forward. In the last quarter after a hard\npush forward by I.C., Dave Dunstone got\nfouled very hard and was awarded a penalty\nwhich he got. Guys scored the last goal to\nbring the final score to 2:4.\nTeam: D. Dunstone, P Mills, D. Roberts, B. Bradley, D. Papacostantinov, B. Davies, N. Buckland.\nI.C.2 now played their game against St.\nThomases.\nThe IC forwards pushed forward from the\nthrow in, and Pat Porter was able to score\nfrom a good pass completely taking the goal\nkeeper off his guard. I.C.'s next goal was also\nscored by Pat with a long shot from the right\nwing.\nSt. Thomases gained possession of the ball\nand scored a lucky goal. They were, however,\ncompletely out played and were not given\nanother opportunity to break. As if to stress\nthat I.C. were very much in control Pat scored\nhis third goal of the match by neatly placing\nthe ball through the goal keeper's hands.\nIn the second half of the game Dave\nRoberts scored after swimming up the left\nwing. IC's last goal was scored by Dimitri\nPapacostantinov with a flick shot from in\nfront of the goal. The final score to a well-deserved win by I.C. was 5-1.\nTeam: P. Porter, D. Roberts, D. Papacostantinov, B. Davies, M. Cherry, B. Bradley.\nOn Thursday 22n dI.C.1 played another\ngame in the UL U League against University\nCollege.\nThe goal scoring was opened by Dave\nDunstone with a strong swim up the pool and\na hard shot in goal. U.C. pushed back but\nwere prevented from scoring by good\nmarking by our backs. Dave scored I.C.'s second goal after an accurate pass from the\nback. In the second quarter U.C. put a lucky\nshot past Dave Roberts who was playing in\ngoal for the first two quarters. However\nalmost immediately Philip Mills scored after\nbreaking off his man. I.C. was playing well as\na team with tight marking and covering back,\nbecause of this play U.C. were given little\nopportunity to score.\nIn the third quarter U.C. pushed forward\nand scored with a very hard and accurate shot\nwhich left our goalie standing. I.C. pushed\nback immediately with another goal scored\nby Philip The score was pushed up to 5:3 by\nthe end of the third quarter, our other goal\nbeing scored by Dave. In the final quarter\nCROSS COUNTRY CLUB\nAs Sunday paper sports readers may have\nseen, Mike McLeod won the National Cross\nCountry Championships at Luton last\nSaturday and Gateshead won the team race.\nWhat the papers didn't tell, however, was of\nthe fortunes of the I.C. team. Now read on.\nIn an epic race in which Steve Ovett could\ncome no better than 6th and Brendan Foster\nonly 19th, the mighty Stu Littlewood\nastounded everyone to finish a magnificent\nfive hundred and fifty ninth. Steve Webb, of\nsomewhere in the Blackett Laboratory and\ncaptain of Hercules Wimbledon, was\nshunned by his own club and so chose to run\nfor us, contributing 617 points to the team\nscore. Bryan Acford failed abysmally in his\nattempt to beat Brendan Foster, but\nnevertheless just about finished in the first\nhalf of the field in 833rd place. Geoff\nSherwood, running in his first National,\nsuccessfully broke the four figure barrier to\nbe 987th. March Pickard, having competed in\na55( five five) mile charity race in Manchester\nearlier in the morning (!), arrived minutes\nbefore the start and pushed his day mileage\nto 64 whilst finishing 1034th. Meanwhile, Rich Harrington and Pete\nJohnson were having a private battle to see\nwho could finish closest to the number on\ntheir vest. Rich (1321) won by being 1317th, and thus completed the I.C. scoring team,\nand Pete (1323) was a close second in 1334th. Our team total of 5347 points (only 5149\nbehind Gateshead) was sufficient to leave us\nin our usual position of about 100th. Mark Thwaites, competing in the Junior\nrace against many people a year older and\nvastly more experienced, completed the\ntough 6 miles course in 443rd place.\nUnfortunately, since Mark was our only\ncompetitor we were unable to repeat last\nyear's performance when we finished the last\ncomplete team.\nOnce again the selectors have ignored the\npotential wealth of talent that we possess in\nthe club, and chosen the first 9 finishers to\nrepresent England in the International in\nIreland. We must obviously claim independence for I.C. and thus send our own\nteam.\nThis report was brought to you by your on-the-spot team of observers - Steve Kirk (Team\nManager), Maurice Wilson (Team Recorder)\nand Ian Morton (Photographer).\nTABLE TENNIS\nBy the time this report is printed, I shall undoubtedly have been beaten at\nthe R.C.S. Pressy Elections and be just\nthe T.T. Publicity nobody again ah,\nwell, on with the show and all that\nTwo weeks since the last report (lucky john Harris!) due to lack of matches, but the two\nresults from a fortnight ago are: -CUP MATCH( away)\nI.C. IV v DEPT. OF EMPLOY II 4-5\nThe fourths did extremely well against a team two divisions higher (having beaten D. of E in the previous round) but were just\nedged out of the cup this time. Rutherford\nwon three matches and Lambert one.\nI. C.v FULHAM V( Home) 3-6\nAnother defeat for the thirds means that\nthey will be the least successful I.C. side this\nseason - guess who plays for the thirds! Last\nweek, a disaster for the 2nds against\nG AIX S FORD IV. the top team in Div. V. Had the 2nds won. they would have gone top,\nbut they lost 5-4 away, with Tye and\nRutherford winning two games each. On the\nbright side however, second place (and hence\npromotion) is virtually assured now.\nI. C.1v THAMES WATER AU TH.81 Another rampaging win for the firsts keeps\ntheir hopes of promotion very healthy, with\nonly a handful of matches to play. (You can\ndp it Kumar!). Far less successful were I.C. IV v BARBICAN II (Home). This 5-4 defeat\nseriously impaired - nay, has almost certainly\ndestroyed, their promotion hopes unless a couple of minor miracles occur - like the\nthirds beating BARBICAN in two weeks\ntime.\nAlso last weekend saw a small I.C. contingent (plus several U.L. U. players from\nI.C.) in the Thames Polytechnic Open Championships.\nThe most successful player was Kartik La khani( Chem 2) who reached the quarterfinal of the men's singles, but Rutherford,\nStean and Singarajah were less fortunate,\nbeing eliminated in rounds two or three.\nHere's hoping I haven't drowned at the\nSwimming Gala,\nSuper Moron Dave scored yet another goal for I.C. to make\nthe final score 6:3. I.C. winning a well played\ngame, and hopefully starting a long string of\nwins yet again.\n7e am:S. Taylor, D. Dunstone, P. Mills, D. Roberts, N. Buckland, S. Hadden, B. Bradley,\nJ. Grove.\nOn Friday 2nd March I.C.2 played a Middlesex League match against Hounslow.\nThe match started with a couple of I.C.s players not present. In the first quarter\nHounslow seemed to have played all their\nown way, they scored three goals by breaking\nthrough I.C.'s slightly disorganized defence.\nHowever, in the second quarter IC pulled\ntogether as a team and stopped most of\nHounslow's breaks at goal. Hounslow,\nhowever, still managed to score one goal with\na good pass and flick in front of our goal.\nIn the third quarter after the arrival of Dave\nChadwick, I.C. played an attacking game.\nDave opened I.C.'s scoring after a swim up\nthe pool and a shot into the left of the goal. He\nscored another two goals in rapid succession\nwith fast and aggressive play. Hounslow were\nawarded a penalty halfway through the\nquarter due to a slight misunderstanding, and\nwith that, pushed the score up to 3:5.\nIn the final quarter Dave was awarded a penalty which he got and Hounslow managed\nto score one more goal to make the final score\n4:6.\nTeam: D. Chadwick, M. Cherry, P. Porter, C. Dale, E. Iverson, B. Bradley, B. Davies, D. Papacostantinov, S. Madden.\n\n"

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE ALL THE EDITOR'S MEN\nFELIX Financing- The Full Story\nThe Union has forced FELIX to drastically reduce printing\ncharges and completely revise its own estimates for next\nyear's expenditure following accusations of profiteering on\nprinting jobs.\nJohn Shuttleworth, one of the three candidates in next week's election for FELIX Editor, published a campaign broadsheet\n\" Fl LEX\" last Friday in which he accused successive FELIX Editors and Business Managers of making a500 per cent profit\non offset-litho printing instead of breaking even as people had\nbeen led to believe. He also claimed that FELIX was ruled by a\" FELIX Club Clique\".\nThe Liberal Club newspaper FORWARD! not unexpectedly\ntook up the story on Ttresday this week and published the\nresults of their own detailed investigation.\nThe Print Unit has always charged for paper, plates, extras and\nmachine time, the latter being the cost of paying the litho operator.\nHowever, FELIX itself has only had to pay for paper, the other costs\nbeing paid by College.\nThis has given rise to huge profits. For example the FELIX accounts\nfor the last six months of l978 show an income of\u00a3l,521 from offset-litho\nprinting and do not mention expenditure on plates or machine time.\nHowever, when FELIX Business Manager Dave Crabbe submitted\nhis estimates for next year he claimed an income of only \u00a3550 on\nprinting and typesetting jobs and asked for a Union grant of\u00a32,800. A further income of \u00a31,200 from advertising meant that the total\nexpenditure by FELIX was estimated at \u00a34,550.\nJohn Shuttleworth was not the down to the cost of paper plus a only person to suspect that\nsomething was wrong. IC Liberal\nClub had long suspected that\ncharges were too high and Union President Mary Attenborough\nhad also seen the discrepancy\nbetween the accounts and the\nestimates. She had ta meeting of\nqueried this at\nIC Union Publications Board, but Publications Board Chairman John Allen was unable to take up\nthe matter fully before the story\nbroke.\nJohn Allen said that he had\nbeen aware of the profit being\nmade. He showed me copies of\nestimates prepared by Dave\nCrabbe for both FELIX and the\nIC Union Handbook, in which a \u00a3450 sum for printing the\nHandbook did not appear as\nincome in the FELIX estimates.\nAfter the publication of FILE X a Union Finance Committee\nmeeting cut printing charges\n50p profit margin for the Union, clubs and societies. This will only\ntake effect next session so that\nFELIX does not face sudden\nfinancial difficulties now. Individuals, apart from election\ncandidates, will still face higher\ncharges.\nBecause the hidden income will\nno longer be available, FELIX is\nnow claiming a \u00a33,571 grant from\nthe Union, the true cost of\nproducing FELIX now being put\nat \u00a35,321.\nA meeting of Publications\nBoard on Monday decided to set\nup an equipment fund for the\nPrint Unit to pay for new\nmachinery formerly financed out\nof FELIX profits. Profit from\noutside printing and typesetting\njobs would enter this fund which\nwill be used firstly to replace the\nlitho unit.\nPublications Board also heard\nthat FELIX had agreed to pay\nback \u00a3400 into the Publications\nBoard reserve account to\ncompensate for overcharging on\nthis year's ICU Handbook.\nOne of the people at the centre\nof the row is of course the FELIX Editor John Harris. He told me\nthat he had cooperated with john Shuttleworth and the other\ninvestigations because the matter\nhad been weighing heavily on his\nconscience for some time. He had\nbeen bothered by it since last term\nbut had not done anything\n\"because it seemed easier to perpetuate\nthe system than to fight to change it\".\nTo the best of his knowledge John Shuttleworth's allegations were\ncompletely true.\nOne of the principal accused is\nDuncan Suss, last year's Editor\nand formerly Business Manager.\nHe denied having personally\nincreased the printing rates at the\nend of 1976 as he had at that time\nresigned as Business Manager.\nBut, he explained, the charges\nhad gone up because Clive\nDewey, then Editor, had overspent his budget and was\nheading for a \u00a31,000 deficit. The\nUnion had set the high charges to\novercome Clive Dewey' s overspending.\nHe went on to say that it did not\nmatter what FELIX charged\nclubs and societies because the\nprinting costs were reflected in the\ngrant they got from the Union and the money was all coming\nfrom the College anyway. Printing costs outside College\nwere at least twice as high.\nThe surplus cash had all been\nput to excellent use, he continued.\nFELIX had acquired a camera,\nplate maker and a ph to typesetter,ad vastly improved the\nquality of work produced and\nsaved the Union from having to\ngo to commercial concerns. He\nestimated that the new equipment was saving the LJnion\nup to \u00a32,000 per year.\nHe denied that F ELf X was\ncontrolled by a FELIX Club Clique pointing out that FELIX Club was only a social club. He hoped John Shuttleworth would\napologise for some of his\nstatements.\nThe main outcome of the row is\nthe reduction in printing charges.\nThe issue has overshadowed all\nothers in the election for FELIX Editor as both John Shuttleworth\nand David Crabbe are candidates\nfor the post - the third is Colin Palmer. John Shuttleworth's allegations of control by a FELIX Club Clique have been followed\nby accusations that the Union is\ntrying to take over FELIX. Nobody has been accused of\npersonal gain or corruption, only\nof obtaining money for FELIX by\ncovert means. It is' to be hoped\nthat FELIX has not suffered\nunduly and that everyone will\nbenefit from the matter being\ncleared tip.\nREGULATOR PROPOSALS A staggering 20 per cent\nrefectory price rise per year could\nresult from a new regulator\nproposed by Refectory Committee Chairman Professor Eilon.\nBut Union President Mary\nAttenborough has written a paper\nwhich argues that a much smaller\nprice rise could cover Increased\nwage costs. And the Rector has\nsaid that no new scheme will be\napplied until he is fully satisfied\nthat it is justified.\nRefectory Committee met on\nThursday last week to draw up a formula for a new regulator which\ncould up prices in line with\nincreases in both food and wage\ncosts, following protests by\nImperial College Union over the\nway the regulator is currently\napplied.\ncon td. on back page\n\n"

The\ndifference Of opinion arose over\nthe calculation of the wage\ninflation element.\nProfessor Ei lon's scheme involves a1 per cent rise each\nmonth to cover an alleged 20 per\ncent increase in labour costs.\nHowever, Mary Attenborough has\nsaid that his method does not\naccount for increased turnover in\nthe refectories reducing the\nincrease in labour cost per meal.\nShe has proposed a0.2 per cent\nmonthly price rise with a1.3 per\ncent increase at the beginning of\nthe financial year on 1st August.\nThis is based on an 8 per cent\nwage settlement.\nMary Attenborough told a FELIX reporter that she thought\nProfessor Eilon's scheme was\nabsurd. Prices could go up by 10\nper cent in 5 months, which was\nfar more than necessary. |\nShe was angry that the meeting\nwas not allowed to vote on the\nnew scheme as Professor Eilon\nsaid it was Executive action. But\nthe Committee did vote against\nany termly price rise for next term.\nThe Union is taking no further\naction until the Rector makes\nknown his views on the new\nregulator.\nFELIX CONSTITUTION FELIX is an IC Union Society as\nwell as a newspaper, following the\nUnion Publication Board's acceptance of a five-page FELIX\nConstitution last Monday.\nAccording to the Constitution\nproposed by FELIX Editor John\nHarris, the objects of the Society\nare:\na) to aid the Editor in the\nproduction of the paper\nb) to provide for social activity\namong those who help on the\npaper\nc) to make available to its\nmembers knowledge and use of\nthe facilities of the Union Print\nUnit.\nThe Editor and Business Manager, currently the only\nofficially existing FELIX posts, will\n*be ex-officio members of the i FELIX Committee which will\ninclude eight other members\nelected at the FELIX Annual\nGeneral Meeting early in the\nsummer term. The Editor and\nBusiness Manager will continue\nto be elected by the Union.\nThe Committee posts will be\nHonorary Secretary, Social Secretary, News Editor, Sports\nEditor, Reviews Editor, Photogra1\nphi c Rep., Media Rep. and one\nordinary member.\nThe Society is a separate entity\nfrom the \"FELIX Club\" to which\nmembers have to be elected by\nthe existing membership.\nSeveral people have welcomed\nthe introduction of the FELIX\nConstitution and expressed a hope that it will provide the\nframework for more students to\nbecome involved in FELIX.\nHON SEC IN HOSPITAL At 7.38, last Friday morning, Pete Hoddinot (RSM Hon. Sec.) fell 20 ft.\nthrough a wired cast glass skylight, above a storeroom in Mines, and\nlanded on a pile ot asbestos which helped to break his fall. A few years\nago a French boy died falling through the same skylight.\nPete was late for a trip to an open-cast coal field organised by the Min\nand Met Society. He had been told that a stuffed goat had been hidden\non the other side of the wall that runs alongside Prince Consort Road.\nHe vaulted over the wall and crashed through the wired glass.\nPeter Bamford 'phoned for an ambulance and was the first to reach\nPete. Mr. Hoddinot's face was covered in blood and there was a large\npiece of glas protruding from just under his eye. Pete was in a state of\nshock and was worried because he couldn't see. However Mr. Hoddinot,\nrenown for his strength on the rugby field, soon managed to recover\nfrom the shock.\nPete was sent to St. Stevens hospital and had an operation last\nTuesday. After a short spell in intensive care he is now high-spirited and\neager to come back to col leg e. He is expected to have left hospital by the\ntime FELIX is published and has had many visitors .... \"almost all of\nRSM\" and several staff.\nCollege Secretary Gives Lecture\nMickey Davies, the College Secretary, who has been at IC\nsince 1962 is to retire on 30th June this year.\nOn Tuesday he gave an entertaining retirement lecture\nentitled \"In the company of scientists\" in which he reminisced\nabout the years he has spent in the College.\nIn some respects things had changed little, he said. In 1962 IC Union was outside NUS, in 1979 likewise. Complaints about Mooney's chips\nwere the same then as now.\nIn 1962 the College budget was \u00a33 million while in 1979 it had arisen\nto \u00a327 million, he continued. The19789 income from tuition fees alone\nwas greater than the total College income in 1962.\nOver the years he had seen an increase in staff and student\ninvolvement in the College and more democracy. \"Indeed we are now\nliving in a time of more democracy and less money which some would say is not a very good combination\".\nTurning to the future he expressed concern over the College's income\nand a desire for more flexible administration.\nHe concluded his talk with a quotation from W.H. Auden: \"When in\nthe company of scientists I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into\na drawing room full of dukes.\"\nNEWS IN BRIEF\nMORE STRIPPERS The Women in Science and Technology group is to picket\nMines Revue on Thursday\nbecause there will be strippers on\nthe bill.\nAlthough both a male and female stripper will be featured\nthe women feel that the presence\nof a male stripper on this occasion\nwill make no difference to the way\nin which such events degrade\nwomen. Women are still being\ntreated as sex objects, whereas a single male stripper will not\nchange the attitude of men\ntowards each other. In any case\ntwo wrongs do not make a right,\nsay WiST. A WiST spokeswoman pointed\nout that the advertisments for the\nRevue depicted only a woman,\nwhich showed what the event\norganisers were really thinking\nabout.\nThe Revue will be in the Junior\nCommon Room and the women\nwill be picketing outside before\nthe 8.00 p.m. start. The group\nhave picketed RCS Smoking\nConcert for the last few years in\nprotest against the presence of\nstrippers there.\nCANNABIS ICU IN FORMS GOVERNMENT Union President Mary Attenborough has written to the\nHome Secretary Merlyn Rees\ninforming him of IC Union's decision to support the legal is ation of cannabis.\nIn her letter she pointed out\nthat there is no evidence that\nsmoking pot is harmful, and expressed a hope that \"the\nGovernment will take note of the\nfeelings of Ihe millions of people who\nhave tried cannabis and suffered no ill\neffects\".\nMary's letter follows a decision\nat a recent Union Meeting to\nsupport the legal is ation of cannabis and affiliate to the\n\"Legalise Cannabis\" campaign.\nICU CLAIMS MORE MONEY Imperial College Union is to\nask College for a \u00a3134,000 grant\nnext session to pay for running the\nUnion and all its clubs and societies.\nThis figure represents a16.5 per cent increase on this year's grant and was arrived at after\ndetailed consideration of estimates submitted by all Union bodies.\nNEW SCHOLARSHIP The World University Service\nhas proposed a new scholarship to\nenable a\" third world\" student to\nstudy at Imperial College.\nThe scholarship would be\ntenable for a one-year M.Sc. course. The College would waive\ntuition fees, and money to cover\nthe student's living costs would be\nraised from academics. The College Deans have suggested\nthat the Rector and Union President Mary Attenborough\nlaunch an appeal.\nIC Union raised \u00a3500 for the\nWorld University Service at the\nbeginning of the session when\nstudents were invited to donate\n50p when collecting their Union cards.\nMP TO HELP ICU Geoff Edge, Labour MP for\nAldridge Brownhills, has agreed\nto arrange a meeting between\nrepresentatives of Imperial College Union and personal\nadvisers to Education Secretary\nShirley Williams in response to\nICU's tuition fees campaign.\nUnion President Mary Attenborough's home is in Mr. Edge's constituency near Birmingham and she lobbied him\nlast Monday as part of the\nUnion's campaign.\nMr. Edge, a member of\nLabour's Tribune Group, used to\nwork for the Department of\nEducation and Science. He will\ntry to fix the meeting as soon as\npossible.\nApart from tuition fees, Mary Attenborough intends to raise the\nquestion of\" the Government's general attitude towards overseas\nstudents and the problem of the\nordinary residence definition.\nICU ON GRANTS MARCH IC Union is to participate in\nNUS's grants march today and provide a float despite NUS's decision not to allow ICU to take\npart as an organisation.\nAn External Affairs Committee\nmeeting on Wednesday decided\nto ignore the NUS ban, imposed\nbecause ICU is no longer a member. The float will depict the\ngrant problems of overseas\npostgraduate students and the\nmeans test. A coach will be\nleaving the Union Arch at 1.15\np.m. RCS ELECTIONS The election for the top posts in\nRCS Union held on Tuesday this\nweek has been declared in quo rate. An RCS Union Meeting today is to decide\nwhether to ratify the results.\n\n"

    "content": "Page 3\nWhen the cat's away....\nBy now the \"great FELIX scandal\" will be common knowledge, and by this time\nnext week it will probably all have been forgotten. Personally, I am very relieved\nthat the story concerning our Litho-charges has come to light and deeply grateful\nto those who helped me come to the decisions that played a part in its exposure.\nAlthough I was bothered about the rates when I was Business Manager it has taken\nsix months of my Editorship to get around to doing anything about it.\nHopefully the situation will improve from now on, but one or two things still need\nto be said.\nFirstly, there is no danger of the Union taking over FELIX. The Print Unit belongs\nto the Union anyway: the final say in what is or is not printed belongs to Pub.\nBoard. Production of FELIX has always been the responsibility of the Editor as, I'm sure, it will continue to be.\nSecondly, although FELIX, and hence the Union, has gained plenty of new and\nexpensive equipment as a result of the deception, such deceit cannot possibly be\njustified. It's this kind of \"ends justify the means\" argument that has perpetuated\nthe fraud for so long. Clubs and Societies have a right to know what they are being\ncharged for, and they should certainly not be used to sub sid is e this unit. The \"We\nknow what's best for you in the long run\" attitude is a very dangerous one indeed.\nOne man show to Democracy\nAnother complaint that is levelled at FELIX from time to time is that it is a clique.\nHopefully, the new FELIX constitution will smash that impression once and for all.\nWhilst retaining Editorial Freedom, the Editor is now part of a committee which\nregularly discusses the content and policy of FELIX. Also, this structure will make\nit easier to attract and retain student volunteers who want to help on the paper,\nespecially during Freshers' Week which is, in any case, a very busy time for the\nEditor. All in all it should create a more sociable and open FELIX.\nDoubtless this will come as a great blow to those who would rather retain power\nby restricting information or hide behind a host of technical terms. All I can say to\nthem is, tough!\nA subscription has yet to be fixed, but as soon as it is FELIX will be open for\ngeneral membership. Also, papers for next year's committee will be going up next\nterm so if you're thinking of standing....\nThe Future\nFinal details have yet to be worked out, but as of July f st there will be three new\nrates for Litho-printing as well as the new typesetting facility. But, increased load\non the print unit will inevitably cause delays, resulting in a much longer turnaround then at present.\nForthcoming Events\nAfter the meaty stuff there are a few events you should know about. There will be\na Lunchtime Prom in the Consort Gallery on Tuesday 13th March at 1:00 p.m. The\nprogramme includes Vaughan Williams, Bach and Vivaldi, played by the Consort\nChamber Orchestra.\nToday sees the Grants Demonstration march from DES to Hyde Park. The aims\nare to stop grants falling below the cost of living, ending of financial dependence\non parents and ending discretionary awards. The NUS didn't want us to go on this\nmarch, so there's an added incentive. Constact Tim Hillyer or Mary Attenborough\nin the Union Office for further details.\nNotification of Meeting\nThe Annual General Meeting of the Athletic Grounds Committee will take place\njust before the Results U. G.M. at 1:00 p.m. on Thursday 15th March in the Great\nHall. All members of the Union are invited to attend this meeting which ratifies next\nyear's committee.\nVandalism\nAs a result of mis-use of the College headliner machine during the scramble to\nproduce election publicity, the door to the headliner room will, in future, be\nlocked. Anyone wanting headliner for official Union work only will have to come\nand see me for the key.\nCredits\nMany thanks to everyone at IC Radio especially John Allen for so quickly\ninstalling a speaker in the FELIX Office. It really makes working at night a lot\neasier. To \"Harvey and the DJ\", who gave us lots of laughs on Wednesday night as\nwell as playing our requests, all I can say is, Paste-downs indeed! Cheers,\nJohn\nPS. Don't forget to vote!\nDear Sir, - Just because I think tHe\nSocialist Party of Great Britain is\na con travers i al organisation that\ncan provide an interesting and\nentertaining discussion does not\nmean I agree with it. I would have\npreferred it if you had kept my\nname off the end of the article.\nI would like to reply to Miss\nPratt's points (the editor has\nrequested me to be brief).\nAlthough it may not appear so\nsuperficially, men have more to\ngain from freely - available\nabortion than women. A man can\neasily evade all responsibility for\nlooking after a woman and his\nchild by telling her to go and have\nan abortion. To kill her own child\ngoes against all a woman's maternal instincts, however far\nremoved a woman may imagine\nthe foetus to be. How many\nwomen who do not wish to have\nan abortion are bullied and\npress uri sed by boyfriends, parents, husbands etc. into\nhaving one?\nYes, of course abortions is a traumatic experience. That is\nanother reason why organisations\nlike PATA try to help a woman\nwho wishes to avoid one in every\nway they can.\nTo justify killing a person\nbecause he isn't really human because he's3\" long is as\nridiculous as saying someone can\nbe killed because he is not really\nhuman because he's got black skin\n(or because she's a woman!)\nNo matter how good a person's reasons ma v be I would not like\nTHEM to decide to take MY life\nno matter how much they may\nthink it is for my benefit.\nThe presence of abortion\nprovides the powers - that - be\nwith a good excuse for not\nimproving the conditions in\nsociety for adequate care of the\n\" unwanted\" child.\nWith the shortage of children\nfor adoption in this country it is\nquite easy for a woman to give her\nchild to selected foster parents if\nshe cannot bring it up \"the way\nshe wants to\". Do you think\nhaving her child adopted is more\ntraumatic for a woman than\nkilling it?\nNeither I, nor PATA, are\nputting any pressure at all on Miss\nPratt to have (conceive) a child.\nIt's her choice, not ours. But once\nthe child is created it is the duty of\nMiss Pratt and everyone else in\nsociety to respect its right to live.\nConception from rape is\nextremely rare. And rape isn't too\ncommon either.\nMost of the other points Miss\nPratt raised were dealt with in my\nfirst letter. I suggest Miss Pratt\nreads my first letter again.\nBarry Austin\nDear Sir, - Iam writing to thank\nour College Administration and\nour Student Union for the actions\nthey have taken concerning the\nsudden change in the interpretation of the grant regulations, due\nto which my local authority has\nnow rectified its decision on my\neligibility.\nI emphasize my gratitude to\nour Rector for his genuine belie!\nand support for equality in\neducation, and his concern with\nstudents' welfare. I would also like\nto thank our Registrar, Mr. Mee and our Deputy Registrar, Mr. Ward, for their sympathy and\nunderstanding of our worries\nabout financial difficulties. Mr. Mee has written and telephoned\nmany times on my behalf. I believe this has had the strongest\ninfluence upon the education\ndepartment.\nPeople who deserve my special\nthanks are our welfare adviser\nv nd the President of our Union. Being a graduate in law, Michael Arthur has exerted tremendous\nefforts with his profound knowledge to elucidate explicitly\nthe meaning of ' ordinary residence' in his very well written\nessay, which has impressed the\neducation authority. Above all, it\nwas our President, Mary Attenborough, who first brought\nour grievance to the attention of\nthe Rector and the Governing\nBody of the College. Also I appreciate greatly the numerous\nletters sent and visits paid to the\nMP's concerned and the Department of Education by our\nPresident, to whom I sincerely\nexpress my gratitude.\nFinally, and most importantly,\nI must mention that there are\nseven students who are still\ndeprived of a grant, un reason ably. I have heard that the Union is planning to take legal action on\ntheir behalf. I hope this will be\nsuccessful.\nIn a word, Iam glad that our\nCollege cares a be ut the welfare of\nits students. I proclaim the\ninjustice of the difficulties\ninflicted upon the students\nconcerned and I request your\nsupport in their imminent legal\nbattle.\nF.Y. LiChe m. Eng. 1\nDear Sir, - Reports in FELIX are\nusually concise, I'd always\nthought due to lack of space.\nElection manifestos are cut at the\n300th word. Why then was a1,743 word (1,753 including title\nand credits) piece of propaganda\nfor The Socialist Party of Great\nBritain included in last week's issue?\nSurely this kind of material is\nbetter suited to fly-posting by the\nrelevant society, (- in the same\nway God Squad plague everyone\nwith St. John's Gospels) - at their\nown expense. Also I'd like to know\nif, to make it fair, you propose to\nprint similar length 'manifestos'\nfrom the Conservatives, Liberals,\nCommunists, Scottish Nationalists Party, National Front ....\nRachel Snee\n\n"

This would go a long way to solving\nour accommodation crisis.\nOn indoor sports, College should oiler\nland free for building a new University of\nLondon Indoor Sports Hall( either Northside\nor next to Chemistry). This would provide\nfacilities for sports such as badminton and\nbasketball.\nOn refectories, continued pressure\nshould be put on College to operate a better\nand cheaper service, and I believe the Union ought to consider running a snack bar itself\nOn tuition fees, the College should set up\na hardship fund to cover hardship arising\nfrom increases, which would also cover all\nareas of financial hardship.\nOn careers, far more people should be\nencouraged to make use of the Prestel careers\ndata service at College, and we should rectify\nthe fact that the University is presently\nunderstaffed with regard to full-time careers\nadvisors.\nOn entertainments, we should ensure\nthat we can use the Great Hall regularly for\nconcerts.\nOn. academic standards, some\ndepartments should look far more closely at\napplicants' individual aptitude for particular\ncourses, to try to cut down failure rates.\nI have sat on both the Academic and External Affairs Committees, and been\nChairman, IC Postgraduate Group\n(I'm a Botany PG). Among other things, I'm now Chairman, IC Union Council and on\nthe College Governing Body.\nVote for the person with most experience\nand ability to deal with a variety of union\nwork and with the enthusiasm to investigate\nthe widespread needs of IC students.

Social life IS\nimportant. But no single facet is ALL important.\nI am the only candidate capable of taking\nthis viewpoint with enough perspective. I can make ICU more representative of IC students.\nThe issues which I feel have particular\nimportance and relevance to students are;\nWelfare\nAccommodation\nRefectories\nIC Ents\nFees\nGrants\nEmployment\nAll these have different problems and implications and no one should be dealt with\nto the exclusion of any other.\nAs well as daily administration and representation I believe that the Union should enter more fully into the services-type\nrole. Possible areas lor this expansion are;\nForeign Exchange Week - A separate\nscheme, run on the same lines as Foreign\nStudents Week in RS M, but open to all IC students. This could not be set up in one year\nbut I would like to start this as a long term\nproject.\nJ CR Stalls - I would like to encourage more\nand different stall holders offering genuine\nreductions.\nDiscount Scheme - This has been suggested\nas a job for the DP whom Iw ill support and\nhelp in this difficult venture.\nI ask you to support my campaign.\nVOTE CHRIS FOX1 For a more Representative.

He calculated that if a trillion\n(1,000,000,000,000) monkeys were to type 10\nrandomly chosen characters at the rate of\none a second it would take, on average, more\nthan a trillion times as long as the Universe\nhas been in existence to arrive at: \"To be or\nnot to be, that is the question.\"\nDr. Bennet believes that with the use of\nrules based on the frequency with which\nletter combinations occur in a given language\na computer programmed to simulate the\nhypothetical monkeys could achieve in\nminutes some startlingly intelligible, if not\nquite Shakespearean, passages.\nDuring one all-night run he was presented\nwith the output, ' To dea now nat to be will and\nthen be does does or nsc a law rou trou ld. \"This\nis the nearest the computer reached to\nachieving the celebrated passage in Hamlet.\nThursday Ist\nSteam train marks Paddington anniversary\nThe 1929-built GWR460 class locomotive\nKing George V left Paddington Station for\nDidcot to mark the 125th anniversary of\nPaddington station.\nThousands turned out to watch it make a nostalgic day trip with 600 enthusiasts on\nboard. A brass band gave it a send-off as\ncrowds waved from bridges, footpaths and\nstations.\nThe King George made the 53 mile trip to\nDidcot but an overheated axle-box meant\nthat it could not make the return trip to\nPaddington.\nBeggar dies leaving over a quarter of a million\nA legless beggar known as \"Eddie the\nMonkey Man\" because of the monkey he\nused to help him panhandling on the streets\nof Washington for more than 30 years, died in\nFlorida leaving an estate of $691,000.\nIn 1972, another beggar accused him of\nusing the money he earned on the streets to\nbuy property in Florida. Eddie said at that\ntime, \"If I had money and property do you\nthink I'd be sitting out in the cold all day? If\nyou think begging is a good life ....just try it.\"\nFriday 2nd Devolution Referendums\nMinisters appeared ready to accept that\nthere now is no possibility of pressing ahead\nwith devolution even in Scotland where 32.9\nper cent voted Yes. As for Wales, which\nproduced a derisory 11.8 per cent Yes vote,\nthe issue is a dead duck.\nTraffic wardens back to normal working\nAfter five months of free parking, motorists\nwill have to begin feeding parking meters.\n1,300 traffic wardens employed by the\nMet. Police will return to full-time work.\nThey have been working to rule since last\nOctober over a9 and-a half per cent pay\nclaim. The wardens decided today to resume\nnormal work while their case was sent to\narbitration. During the dispute wardens have\nbanned overtime and refused to issue tickets\nand reset meters.\nEditor to be chosen for MAYFAIR\nIt is something of a record in Fleet Street\nthat for five years there have been no editorial\nvacancies in a certain magazine but\nMAYFAIR \"entertainment for men\" is\nperhaps an understandable exception.\nNo fewer than fifty applicants have applied\nfor the job of editor. Journalists, from\nveterans of what someone called the second\noldest profession to bright eyed young men\nclutching shorthand certificates have all\nshown interest in the job.\nThe present editor, Mr. Kenneth Bound,\nsaid that the particularly successful applicant\nwill \"be groomed to lead MAYFAIR into the\neighties \"'\n\"/ don't think there are many people who\ncan conceive of a job part of which is to sit in\nan editor's chair and decide whether a young\nlady has the right figure or not to model. It is\nan interesting diversion.\"\nSaturday 3rd Second referendum in Scotland?\nThe Prime Minister is being urged to\nconsider a daring plan to keep his\ngovernment alive. He has been asked by pro-devolution MPs to give voters a second\nreferendum in Scotland. Their grounds are\nthat the electors were not able to understand\nthe ins-and-outs of devolution.\nCoronation Street vote\nDisaster will strike at the Rover's Return\nand viewers were asked who they would like\nto see out of the programme. 362 said Albert\nTatlock should go because he was an old\nmisery. 24 said all of them should get the\nchop and 2 voted Jor the cat.\nSunday 4th Carter calls in 5ada A last effort to save the camp David\nagreements has been made by President\nCarter. He is urging President Sadat of Egypt\nto come to Washington for talks with him and\nMr. Begin before the Israeli Prime Minister\nleaves the USA.\nMr. Begin spoke today of President Carter\nas \"an honest man\" and \"my friend\" but he\nalso determined ly refused to describe him as\nan honest broker. He encouraged the view\nthat Mr. Carter is supporting the Egyptian\nside in negotiations which Mr. Begin\ncontinues to describe as \"in a deep crisis\".\nIndian and Pakistani medicine men to be\nstudied\nA three-year study into the activities of\nIndian and Pakistani medicine men among\nBritain's immigrant communities is to lead to\na recommendation to the DHS S that they\nshould be regulated but tolerated.\nThe man in charge of the project, Professor\nStanley Davis, believes that \" Hakim s\" and\n\"Vaids\" perform services that cannot be\ndirectly replaced by Western medicine.\nA herbal preparation called Reserpine\ntaken in India for centuries, is now being used\nby Western doctors as an effective treatment\nfor hypertension and migraine, while a medicine called Vinchristine, prepared from\nthe periwinkle, is now being used to alleviate\nleukaemia.\nMonday 5th Storm breaks over nurses pay\nBritain's nurses were offered a9% rise - a pay offer virtually identical to that made to\nworkers who did their best to disrupt the\nHealth Service.\nThe first reaction from the nurses, who last\nmonth refused to take any action that would\nharm patients, was disgust and anger.\nNo more Scotch Whiskey for Amin\nBritain banned, this evening, the 'whisky\nairlift' that has pumped supplies of Scotch to\nPresident Idi Amin.
