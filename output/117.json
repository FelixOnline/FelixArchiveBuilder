    "content": "2 FELIX GIL STREETS Gil Streets, alias Fred Nerk, alias\nHerr Obermeistor Fuhrer, alias \"short\nand curly\", is a third year metallurgist\nstanding 5ft6 inches in his Terylene\nsook s.( His height in hare feet is un-known: he admits to having never removed his sook s). He was born in the Lincolnshire hamlet of Toynton all Saints (believe it or not) some years ago, (Lincolnshire\nCounty Police are rather vague about\nhis correct age) on a Saturday morning\nat 8.30. In Gil's own words: \"I knew\nit was a Saturday because I had a half-day off.\"\nHe was educated in his father's garage, on rare occasions attending\nKing Edward VI school at Spilsby ,\n(where he was a corporal in the Lincolnshire Wing A.T.C.). At the age of seventeen a veil of mystery (the Official\nSecrets Act) was lowered on his career,\nwhen he became an apprentice metallurgist\nat Harwell.\nFew facts about the three years he\nspent there have come to public know-ledge. It is known that he played in the first team and the mixed eleven at\nhookey, and that he was evicted from\nhis digs for turning his room into a garage. (Gil says he left because he\nobjected to the landlord, a Welshman,\ncalling him a bloody foreigner.) His\npassion for lying on his back in a pool of grease gave use to his first oar (an H.M. Govt. Special with Singer\nLe Mans engine.) The phenomenal performance of this machine was obtained\nby reducing its weight; mudguards,\nlights, body panels, silencer and seats\nwere removed; eventually Gil was removed too, (to the polio e station)\ncharged with 20 offences, and let off\nwith a caution.\nSince coming to I.C. in1955, Gil's enthusiasm for oars, and for those necessities of life which seem to be associated with cars, has not waned. He\nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\nCLUB\nSPANISH EVENING THURSDAY FEBRUARY 20\nCONCERT HALL 7.30\nSPANISH DANCING TALKS FILMS\nSPANISH WINES ADMISSON FREE\nnow Osna half a Morris Eight (Dixie\nDean owns the other half) and two ladies\nin Tottenham.\nLast year Gil was the R.S. M. Entertainments Officer, and also dinner\n\"o har lie in-oh i ef and official re-builder of Clementine. During his first two years he was on the I.C. Entertainments Cocmittee and is now the Chairman.\nAccording to John Hobson (of Guilds\nEntertainments fame) the Saturday night\nhops here are so enjoyable as to be\nknown as \"Gil's Treats.\"\nThis flurry of activity has,\nhowever, left some time for Gil to\npursue his main interests which in clude making omelettes, running a marriage bureau in conjunction with\nthe social secretaries of several\nwomen's colleges, (frustrated I.C. males take note!) gooseberry pie, and\nhumanity in general.. He says the only\nthing he really dislikes are kippers\nfor breakfast and tall women who wear\nhigh-heeled shoes. His ambitions are\nto enter the Monte Carlo Rally, to\nbuild his own house which he has al ready designed, to marry at 30 and to\ntravel around the world.\nHis immediate ambition is to recover his old bowler hat which was:-Bought for two shillings,\nSwum across the Thames,\nCovered with flour on Morphy Day,\nShattered by fireworks on November\n5th, and which has:-Hobnobbed with Royalty*\nand Been pinched by a member of R.C.S. Gil has been forced to use his best\nSunday bowler as a temporary lampshade,\nso would the present owner of the old\none please return it as soon as possible.\nENGINEERS BALL The annual Dinner and Dance of\nC. and G. College achieved success on\na scale comparable to that of last\nterm's Carnival. The Dinner was held\nin the Upper Dining Hall and the Upper\nRefectory, speeches being relayed to\nthe latter. Mr. Mooney surpassed himself by providing no fewer than 2A9 dinners. The excellence of the speeches\nhighlighted a memorable evening in an\natmosphere considerably less formal than\nthe dress.\nAfter the Royal toast, Professor\nChristopherson, newly elected an honorary member of the Union, proposed\nthe health of the College. There .fas\nnothing much, he remarked, that he oo ul d say, in public, of the President, and\nqui ok ly passed on to the more sefic us matter of I.C.'s expansion, in which\nC.& LG. would play an ever-increasing\npart, as the need for technologists\nbecame more acute. Mr. Dave Stevens\nreplied to the toast and produced the\nsur-rise of the evening - The Spannerrecently reclaimed from R.C.S. A very lively speech followed\nfrom Mr. John Hobson, who embarrassed his guests with some very well\nchosen words. Mr. Chadwick was put\nin his place by an after-party tale.\nAfter enquiring if Mr. Butters had his\ntrousers on, Mr. Hobson: \"Travelled\nthrough the sublime to .... Mr. Gil Streets.\"\nHOP SURVEY\n... o on tin usd from page 1.\nThere seemed to be no preference\nfor either blonde or brunette, providing she is of a \"reasonable s is e and\nshape\" and possesses personality, with\naccent on the latter. One man looks\nfor big eyes but rarely finds them j another looks mainly for nice legs and\nankles j this, he said, is no reflection\non intelligence \"but is very rewarding.\"\nThe opinion of the level of intelligence varied; some thought the females\nwere dim-witted, some over intelligent,\nsome were of \"intelligence comparable\nwith that of I.C. men, which is not saying much.\"\nThere seemed to be a distinct lack of\ndress sense among the girls. Many *a budding flower is obscured by rampant\nfoliage. Men found that they had to\ncompromise between what they want and\nwhat they get, although most men came\nto the hop just for an evening's enter-tain ment, not with any preconceived\nnotion of picking up a girl. Every man questioned intended to\nbuy his partner refreshments. Most girls\nallowed themselves to be led down for a drink during the interval when they were\nvery considerate in the oho i. ce of drinks,\npreferring fruit joice s to spirits, but\nwere more reticent when invited for o of fee.\nWhat about the after-care? Most of\nthe men interviewed had only one girl friend usually at home or none at all; some had a half or three quarters (?)\nof a girl friend but would elaborate no\nfurther. Theoretically as many girl friends as possible were desirable, but\n\"one takes up most of the time and mon-ey.\" Another interviewee had mainly\nnurses as girl friends; his appearance\ncorroborated his statement that \"Nurses\nare the downfall of students.\"\nSuch is the opinion of I.C. men\nof women and allied subjects, representing the general social trend. But,\nof o our se,I. C. hops are only a begin-ning. What is to follow? Doubtless\nyou imagination will satisfy your\ncuriosity!\nIn reply, a past C.&G.

    "content": "6\nFELIX TOUCHSTONEIS MAN MEASURABLE? The topic for discussion at last\nweek's Touchstone, weekend had the rather\nunpromising title, \"Is Man Measurable?\"\nIn fact, although we didn't realise it, we were in for a remarkably interesting\ntalk from the visiting speaker - Mr. R.J. B. Silvey, Head of the B.B.C.'s Audience\nResearch.\nMr.Silvey's talk dealt with \"Social\nResearch\", in which he had been involved\nfor thirty years. He started by saying\nthat social scientists were more like\nordinary people than like \"unwashed art-is ts and tireless poets\", and after observing that the scientist, unlike the lay-man, draws his conclusions only after\nfinding out the facts, said the only\nquestion he could think of to which there\nwas a clear-out \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer was\n\"Is she pregnant?\". This uncertainty\ncomplicated social research, which must\naim to reduce the qualitative to quantitative terms as far as possible but\nnot to reduce human values to cold stat-is tics. The process used is that of\nsampling: a small \"sample\" of people\nis asked a number of questions, chosen\nwith considerable care and usually accompanied by \"decoy\" questions designed\nto keep the victims off their guard.\nThe victims must be representative of\nRAILWAY SOC IN THE EAST END Ten members of the Society, after\nan uneventful journey by District line\nreported to the M.P.D. soon after 2.15\non Wednesday, February 5\u00ab While a guide was being found a gentleman who\nsaid he was de put ising for the shed\nmaster took charge of the party and\ninvited us to inspect at close quarters one of the 1000 h.p. diesel\nlocomotives now being put into service on freight trains on the North\nLondon line. While we were so doing\nthe man we'd3e en first returned with\nour guide, who appeared to be several\nyears our junior, and was obviously\nnot interested but welcomed a chance to\nstop work, and announced that climbing\non the locomotives was forbidden. Our\nfriend told us \"I 've given you perm is sion\" and took charge of the party. He\nshowed us round the shed, which is being converted to deal exclusively with\ndiesel locomotives, while our official guide trailed behind. Then we were let loose in the shed yard and those who'd been put off from bringing their cameras\nby a little rain wondered if they hadn't been too pessimistic.\nOn arriving at Bow Works we waited\n20 minutes for a guide,passing the time\nin searching the walls and floor for\nrelics of pro-grouping railways. Apart\nfrom the Gatekeeper himself all we\nfound was an L.N.W.R. key. The works\nbelonged originally to the North London Railway and no locomotives have\nbeen built there since 1910. It is now used for light and heavy repairs\nand can accommodate up to 16 engines\nat a time.\nOn Sunday March 9th the Society\nis having an all-day visit by diesel\nrailcar to Swindon locomotive works\nand carriage and wagon works. Any\nmember in doubt about the attractions\nof this visit should as* anyone who\no a me on the Severn Tunnel trip last\nyear or read the account of it published in FELIX.\nR.D. W. the whole group being studied (e.g. all radio listeners) - in listener\nresearch, where questions on one day's listening have to be answered the fol lowing day; a questioner might by the.\nevening be looking for a rich old man,\nwhen all he oo ul d find was a poor young\nwoman, who of course just would not do.\n(However, as Mr. Silvey pointed out,the\ntwo are often found together).\nThe speaker went on to talk about\nmeasurement of attitudes, and revealed\nthat Anti-Semitism, abhorrence of sex-education and support for corporal punishment usually go together. He then\ngave reasons for the steady growth of\nsocial research and examples of how it had been used in the past.\nMr. Silvey finished with his own\njob - broadcast audience research -saying that it was very difficult to\nmeasure either the enjoyment of broadcasts or people's comprehension of them.\nThe B.B.C. invites selected members of\nthe public to Broadcasting House, plies\nthem with coffee and biscuits (\"You can\nget them so docile they'll do anything!)\nthen plays a recorded tal V to them, stopping every few minutes to ask questions\non the subject matter. The answers reveal how well the audience understood it. Questions followed, during which\nMr. Silvey mentioned that university\ngraduates tended to answer questions with\n\"What do you mean by ?\". Then the\nbar opened.\nAfter dinner three groups were\nformed and discussion continued until\nabout midnight on a number of questions\narising from the talk. After lunch on\nSunday the three groups reported the res\nu lts of the previous night's deliberations\nOne of the questions had involved suggesting suitable social research to help\n30l ve some social problem. One group\nchose \"Teddy Boys, Students and Debutantes\"\nas their problem: we wonder what the con\nnec tion is! Another, discussing capital\npunishment, decided with great solemnity\nthat it was impracticable to ask someone\nif they had been deterred by the threat\nof hanging from committing murder!\nOther points which emerged were\nthat freewill exists, that there is a case for vocational training for jour-na lists, that there is no cause for making pre-election public opinion polls\nillegal, and in addition such polls\nmight be useful before an important\npiece of legislation; and that M.P.S were a bad lot anyway.\nThe proceedings were wound up by\nMr. Silvey, who agreed with, and amp-li fie d, most of the conclusions.\nJ. W. NO, ITS THE SCIENCE MUSEUM\nMADEIRA MADE CLEARER On Tuesday, January 28th, the\nSociety had another first tasting \"of\nlittle known wines, this time of\nMadeira.\nThe tasting was preceded by a talk\nby Mr. C03sart, who introduced Madeira\naa an island of mild and honey and\nbreath-taking romance.\nThe island has a volcanic soil,\nenriched by the ashes of forests destroyed by fire oen tu ries ago, which\nimparts an u ii mista k able, burnt bitter\nsweetness to the wine.\nMadeira is a heavy fortified wine\nin the Port and Sherry class, w hio hit faintly resembles in taste, with perhaps\na hint of the nutmeg flavour of a Vermouth. It is more akin to a Sherry, for its method of production\nis based on a\" sol era\" system - a system of blending, ensuing a continuity of style. There is thus now\nno vintage Madeira 3ince the .island vines were destroyed by the dreaded\nph yl lox era plague in the late seven-ties. However, the pre-ph yl lox era vintage is still improving in quality,\nfor unlike port, Madeira does not\nsuffer from the usual decay, as it rarely throws any sediment in bottle.\nBeing insensitive to changes in\ntemperature, its chief markets are\nin India and Scandinavia. In England\nit has to compete with Port and Sherry\nand comes a poor third.\nThe four main types of Madeira are\nBual, Verdeiho, Sercial and Malmsay,\nnamed after the species of grape from\nwhich they are made. The latter is a shade too sweet to suit the English\npalate, to which the Bual or Verdeiho\nis more suited; the dark golden colour and pungent luscious bouquet of the\nVerdeiho cannot fail to give pleasure.\nMUSICAL EVENING Some readers may be surprised to\nlearn that there is an I.C. Orchestra.\nLike the Choir this is more than liberally sprinkled with musicians from\nother places.\nOn Thursday 30th January, our\nOrchestra gave a short concert. The\nfirst item, Bach's Brandenburg Concerto\nNo. 1, in F, required three oboe players;\nthere was only one. Undaunted, and with\none oboe, conductor Frank Kennard (music\nmaster, Dulwich College) started ten\nminutes late. A second oboe managed to\nget through the fog in time to arrive\nfor the start of the second movement.\n(Loud applause) During the third move-ment, the Orchestra began to find some\ncohesion, which was more or less maintained for the re3t of the o ono ert. The second item, Konzertstucke for Piano and Orchestra by Schumann, was\nwell performed. The soloist, Cordon\nStewart, R.C.M. was outstanding. The\nI.C. upright was less so; in fact one\nmember of the audience suggested that\nit be offered to Television's Movie\nMagazine.\nThe third item was three Russian\nSongs, sung in that language by Miss\nContinued on page 7 ...\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX5 INDIFFERENCE? LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Sir, The FELIX editorial on the significance of ZETA came as a surprise.\nFor a change, FELIX was concerned with\nthe oldest problem in the world, vis.\npreservation and improvement of humani-ty, in addition to the seo on d oldest\nproblem, viz. Sex. A step in evolution lI thought. After all, preservation\nmust precede propagation. Who wouldn't prefer to have Marilyn Monroe in one\ndelightful SA - active piece rather than\nhave her disintegrated into <\n*\n. - emitting\natoms. But calories must be consumed t before statistics (the vital ones J) are\ndeveloped. It is the fact that calories\nare just not being imbibed over vast\nareas of Asia and Africa that has been\npinpointed by the FELIX editorial in stressing the significance of Zeta. It\nappears that there is starvation at a stage in human history when science can\nprovide plenty. Why?\nWe in Asia are seeking the answer\nto this question. And when we come to\nadvanced countries like this, and to\npremier scientific i not it ut ions such\nas I.C., we hope to learn from the\nmen in these institutions not only\nabout telemeter ing and thermodynamics,\nbut also about the marriage between\nscience and human welfare, wh i oh has\napparently been banned.\nHow much do we learn from the\naverage I.C. students? Very little. Few can teach us what conditions are\nrequired for science to be harnessed\nto human welfare. To be civilized is to be concerned with civilization;\nfrom this standpoint few are civil i sed. We \"ignorant\" natives find\nan appalling ignorance about the\naffairs of large segments of humanity. We find \"free\" minds so\nbrainwashed that they believe they\nshou d n't be concerned with the use\nof science. These makers of to-morrow's world (of course you are,\notherwise money wouldn't be spent\non I.C.) have been indoctrinated in to steering clear of the problem\nof how tomorrow's world should be.\nWhile Jews were being gassed\nand their bodies burnt as fuel, Nazi\nscientists were \"disinterestedly\"\nstudying the efficiency of the conversion into power. Is the at ti tude commonly held by I.C. students\nvery different?\nI doubt it l Which is why we\nAsian and African students are\nimpressed by the editorial in FELIX.\nIn it is the unassuming answer to\nJarman's request far constructive\ncriticism. Camus was committed an\nAlgeria, and it appears that this\neditorial was inspired much more\nby the spirit of Camus than was\nthe \"valiant band of writers\" in\nthe Phoenix.\nYours sincerely,\nA.K. IJ. Ready.\nOUTSIDE VIEW\nDear Sir,\nAs a sporadic reader of FELIX and\nan occasional visitor to I.C.I was\nmost interested to read Viewpoint in the current issue.\nMy own past includes several years\nat one of the older provincial Universities of Mr. Bridgwater's article. I was fortunate in always living close\nto the major buildings of the University\nand, more particularly, that of the\nUnion. Consequently I was able to\ntake part in any activity I chose,\nwithout making a major effort in the\nway of travelling etc., and found out\nsomething of the other fellows' point\nof view.\nNot all of my year were in the same\nposition. Those co ning from neighbouring towns constituted the largest\npart of our 9 to 5 population. It may\nbe coincidence but when I now meet\nmembers of this group conversation is\nmainly United to sex, shop and ale.\nAa I see it the students at I.C. suffer in their University education\nbecause I.C. is both non-residential\nand also a technical College with the\n\u2022x a mining status of a University.\nThe answers to the present pre-domina no e of \"specialist\" University\neducations are, I think:-(a) Completely residential Universities.\n(b) The abolition of the system\nof advanced technical collages\n(I.C. included).\n(o) The removal of the interference\nof Grant Authorities in University affairs in the way of lecture\nattendance reports etc., wh i oh compel many students to become\n\u2022ew i ers of the 9 to 5 class,\nand (d) The removal of teachers from\nUniversity posts and their\nreplacement by lecturers.\nItem (o)is of course the result of local\nbodies misguidedly seeing that the rates\nand tax payer e money is well spent.\nNot all students will agree with\n(d). However if you want to be taught,\nas opposed to learning by the University\nsystem, then one should attend a technical college and leave your place in the\nUniversity Open for someone who wants\nto learn.\nIf our\"narrow minded friends in their rut of self-sufficiency\"lose\nfrom the introduction of the Arts into\nthe College Hostel, or better into the\nCollege itself, the loss will only be\ntemporary. The losers should realise\nthat advances in any one field general ly come by the application of ideas\nand techniques gained from other fields.\nThe sooner one realises that one's own\nfield is not the only worth while one\nthe better.\nYours eto.,\nPsi\nEx Leeds.\nSEX AND BEER\nDear Sir,\nIn his Viewpoint in the last issue\nof FELIX, Mr. Bridgwater dismisses with\nscorn \"sex and beer\" aa opportunities\nof broadening our interests, but I think that they are two of the most\nimportant channels open for possible\npromotion of our intellects.\nIs it not a fast that we meet\nmore outsiders with diverse opinions\nat hops than on most other occasions\nin college life? Can we not express\nourselves more freely with a Jug of\nalcohol in our hands than without?\nThere is more to be gained from these\npursuits than from inviting outsiders\nto join our social clubs and societies.\nYours eto.,\nGLOBETROTTER\nDear Sir, Last October, in FELIX 111, you\npresented the first of a series of\narticles called the \"FELIX GLOBETROTTES GUIDE\". This was both in formative and useful, and I eagerly\nawaited more. FELIX 112 informed us\nthat your correspondent \"had not\nfound his way back to I.C.\" from\nWestfield.\" After that: silence.\nThis, sir, shows FELIX in a very\npoor light. Is FELIX a stick-in-mud\nor has curiosity killed the cat? As\nit will shortly be spring, when a young man's fancy turns to love eto.,\nnow is an excellent time to continue\nthis series.\nMaybe I.C. men are \"tongue-tied,\nleaden-footed\" (FELIX 116) through\nworry about how to get home after\nescorting the girl friend to her\nhome. The novelty of walking back\nfrom Hampstead through the centre\nof London in the small hours of\nSunday morning soon wears off, as\nmost fresher s by now will have\nfound out.\nThis, sir, it is in your hands to\nremedy.\nYours faithfully,\nDave Briggs.\nEditor's note:-Unfortunately for the series our\nGlobetrotter went too far.\nComing shortly - \"Son of Globetrotter\"\nXWORD\nDear Sir,\nI suppose the opinion, recently\nvoiced in fairly prominent quarters,\nthat scientists etc. are uneducated\nis taken by most members of I.C. with\nthe proverbial pinch of NaCl. It is therefore doubly distressing when the\ntruth of it is demonstrated, as\nhappened yesterday in the Dining Hall\nat lunch. Sitting opposite me were\ntwo postgraduates (of which College\nis irrelevant), doing a crossword\nover their meal(X); they argued for\nnearly ten minutes over whether \"Con-se cut ive\" was spelt \"Consecative\"\nof \"Conseccative\". They were followed\nat the table by two gentlemen in\nscarves and macintoshes.\nIt is ea;y to feel superior about\nthis sort of thing, Sir, but surely\nit helps to demonstrate the need for\nintimate contact, in Imperial College,\nwith something more than just \"Science\nand Technology\", i.e. with Education.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. Wendon.\nTHE MOTE\nDear Sir, May I suggest that FELIX first cast out the beam in his own eye, and\nthen proceed to oa t out the mote wh i oh is in his brother's eye.\nI have recently heard FELIX referred\nto as a college \"Reveille\", by a student\nhere, and suggest that circulation might\nbe larger if FELIX more closely resembled\nthe college newspaper it is meant to be.\nAny students preferring \"Reveille\" may\nalways Obtain that mace.sine at any news-agent.\nThe standard of the Arts may net\nbe high at Imperial College, put surely\nwe can produce a newspaper worthy of\nthe greatest science college in the\ncountry.\n\n"

Tell us\nwhat improvements you would like to see.\nAll non-inimical suggestions that involve\nno law-breaking will be carefully con-side red. UNION LIBRARY In the last issue of FELIX, Mr. J.K. Taylor enquired what had happened to\nthe Union Library, he having read in the \"Rector's Bulletin\" that it had\nbeen incorporated into a College General\nLibrarr\n. The position is that the formation of the College General Library\nis subject to the approval by the University Grants Committee of a grant of\nabout \u00a32,000 yearly to pay for a full time librarian, books and upkeep.\nThe General Library Committee consists of several members of staff with\nthree representatives of the Union Library Committee to ensure that the interest of the students are represented.\nThe Union will make a grant of about\n\u00a3250 yearly towards the purchase of\nbooks, which will be chosen by the\nUnion Library Committee only.\nThe principal advantages of this\nscheme are that a full-time library will be available, and it will be on the is land site. However, it will be seven\nor eight years before it can be housed\non the site, and at the moment, with\nbooks being added at the rate of 600 a year, the see om mods tio a is quite in.. suf fAn i ent. It is hoped that Ho. IS,\nPrince's Gardens may be taken over,\nbut this too is subject to U.G.C. ap-pro val. If this is forthcoming, the\ndeo orating and installation of shelving\nshould be completed by next session.\nThe Union Library has recently\nbeen open only from 1 to 2 p, nu and\nhas been in somewhat oha o tie state.\nThis was due to the C departure early\nthis term of Miss Bamfard, the assistant to Mr. James of the C. and G. Library. However, a new assistant has\nnow been appointed and, starting this\nmonth, the Library will again be open\nin the afternoons.\nWhen the fresher comes to this col-leg e, anxious to make the best' of the\nwonderful college life he has heard so\nmuch about, he is immediately subjected\nto a barrage of propaganda from FELIX\nand from students conditioned to FELIX'S views. I am referring of course to the\npropaganda against the \"vice* of brown-bagging. What FELIX and others do not\nappear to realize is that brown hag g ing does not necessarily mean a narrow edu-cation, and even if it does it is in some oases justified.\nLast year about a third of the\nstudents at I.C. lived, for better or\nfor worse, at home. Why should these\nstudents make the Union the centre of\ntheir social life? Are they to stop\nassociating with their old friends just\nbecause they have gone to college?\nThere is little to be gained in per suing activities at college which can more\nconveniently be pursued at home.\nSecondly many students, especially\npost graduates ( who again make up about\na third of the I.C. student population),\nhave led a full life at college but have\nnow had enough of the hectic uncertainty\nand anxious competition which is inherent\nin student life, All students realize\nsooner or later that college isn't every-THE FUNCTION OF THE PHOENIX\nDear Sir, Criticism of the last issue of\nPhoenix has been flying fast and furious\nover the past fen weeks. A great deal\nof this has been \u2022useful and interesting.\nHowever it is getting to a stage where\nthe points used in arguments on both\nsides are becoming banal and on the\nverge of bad taste. The more constructive criticisms have given helpful\nguidance in the compiling of the next\nissue which is already well towards the\nproof reading stage. Being the only person left to maintain the continuity of\nthe magazine, when I was seriously indisposed it was difficult indeed, to even\nattempt to find anybody who could produce from scratch the autumn issue.\nThat Peter Jarman and his colleagues\nproduced an issue at all is commendable.\nThat they produced an issue with many\ngood articles is highly commendable. It was badly balanced; there was little with direct bearing on I.C, It must be\nremembered,though, that Imperial College\nis not all that interesting; students\nhere, whatever their intrinsic cap abi li ties, do not easily come by the art of\nconscious self expression; events here\ntend to centre round the triter things\nin life. This is not cultural snobbery;\nthis is rather an obvious state of\naffairs.\nAnother point is this. The symbolism of the scientist and engineer\ndiffers from that of an artist or writer.\nThis tends to create an artificial barr i er between the two modes of expression.\nThere is the cultural snobbery of art and\nliterature; there is the cultural snobbery of technology. Surely the function\nof a magazine such aa Phoenix is to attempt in its own way to break down the\nbarrier. Thus the arts must, as far as\nthis is possible without distortion, be\ninterpreted in terms the scientist can\neasily grasp. It is a difficult task\nbut worthy of the effort.\nTours sincerely,\nAnthony Hodgson.\nthing, and none more so than married stu-dents, of whom there must be two or\nthree hundred at I.C. Can brown bagging be justified if it is due to concentration on work to the\nexclusion of almost all else? Consider\nthe third year student who has made the\nbest of what college can offer, but then\nfinds that he is heading for an \"upper\nsecond.\" I am sure that FELIX is not\ngoing to try to stop him working all hours if it will bring him a\" first\" and\nwith it exemption from national service.\nIt is worthwhile devoting one year al most entirely to academic studies to\nsave those two relatively wasted years\nin the army.\nHowever if anyone reading this viewpoint has already fitted himself into\none of these categories I hope he is not\nmaking it an excuse. I do not believe\nthat there is anyone in this college who\ncannot reasonably take part in some student activity. Only a fool does not\nmake use of the opportunities, that college can offer. If those who are brown-bag gers only through sheer lack of initiative would take more interest in the\nUnion, then the burden of I.C.'s non-ao a de mio reputation would not fall so\nheavily on those to whom College is their whole life a state of affairs\naa much to be deplored as brown bagging. F. Peacock.\nFAIR HEARING\nDear Sir,\nAs a member of the Musical Society\nI am somewhat perturbed by the at ti tude of a large section towards the\nI.C. Choir.\nThe attitude of a friend of mine i is typical. On being \u00bb3k edif he w \u00abs coming to our performance of Bach's, Mass in B minor on March 12th, he\nreplied \"What, come and hear you lot, not likely J\" or words to that effect.\nHe nevertheless maintains that he\nis a music lover, and attempts to\njustify his attitude by saying that\nhe thinks we are b awful. YET HE\nHAS NEViR HEARD US SINGS Surely for\na( presumably) educated person this\nis a remarkable piece of judgment!\nThis state of mind is, I fear, all too common among fellow students. They\nbase their Opinion of the I.C. choir\non that of their (presumably) mediocre\nSchool Choir.\n' We are NOT mediocre. Wa are NOT\na school choir and we ARE worth hearing.\nWe are performing on March 12th a great work, perhaps the greatest\nchoral work of all, for which many of\nus have been rehearsing for over 12\nmonths. All we ask is that you give\nus one fair hearing, this once, and\nwe feel some of you will not go away\ndisappointed.\nYours faithfully,\nBryan J. Tilley.\nVacation Accomodation:\nFlat at Hotting Hill Gate vacant\nover Easter vacation. Moderate terms\nfor 1,2, or 3 persons. Apply J. L. Sellers via Union Rack.\n\n"

    "content": "4\nEVERY FORTNIGHT Ho 117 IMPERIAL COLLEGE FEBRUARY 14, 1958\nFRESH MODEL FOR NEW HOSTEL THE LATEST IN STUDY BEDROOMS This week the third of the model\nstudy-bedrooms e reo ted in No. 14 Prince's Gardens by Richard Sheppard and Partners\nwas finished. The room embodies several\ninteresting ideas, but comparison with\nthe previous two reveals some economies\nthat may not find favour with students.\nFIRST THINGS FIRST\nWorkmen were still in the room\nwhen it was inspected by FELIX reporters and the only piece of furniture in evidence was the bed, equipped with a polythene-wrapped mat-tress.\nThe room measures approximately\n14* 6\" hy 8' 6\". A sliding window\noccupies one end, with an imitation\nmarble slab over a heater forming a window seat, as in the original models\n(see photograph). At the other end\nare the (hollow) door and wash-basin.\nThe latter is set away from the wall\nto make for e ay cleaning, the only\nvertical support being the waste pipe,\nw hio his chromium plated. The taps\nare not sprung but are similar to\nthose in the Union.\nAbove the basin and the door, running the whole length of the wall, is a fairly deep cupboard, useful for storing suitcases etc. A bare pearl light\nbulb protrudes from its underside to\nprovide a shaving light.\nNO STRETCHING\nThe room has only one power point,\nsituated 6* above floor level about\nhalf-way along the side wall. The\nlighting switch is three feet above\nthis and thus limits the placing of\nfurniture. The idea is that if one's bed is nearby no stretching is required to reach it. The light itself\nis suspended from the ceiling by several feet of flex (looped up on itself). The intention is that it can be pulled over to any part of the room by\nstrategically placed pieces of string.\nNo table lamp is envisaged.\nThe furniture to be used in the\nhostel has not been finally decided\nupon. Divan beds with low headboards\nand interior sprung mattresses will be used; wardrobes on castors may be.\nAlternative forms of book shelving are\non view - a box arrangement that stands\non the floor and a narrow Dexion-like\nrack running from picture-rail to\nfloor to which four rather shoddily\nfinished shelves are affixed at desired heights, unfortunately both of\nthese occupy some floor space and\nstudents may prefer the better finished article shown in the photograph,\nwh i oh allows a desk to be placed be-neath.\nSUGGESTIONS\ntt is to be hoped that these rooms\nwill be opened for a few days to members of the Union, so that the predecessors of those who will use them\ncan pass criticism and make suggestions.\nHOTTER WOMEN WANTED TO MELT I.C. HEARTS\nThe 3e cond phase of the FELIX hop\nsurvey went into operation last Saturday. This time the women were under\nfire. What did the men want? Did\nthey get it? That is what we wanted\nto know. Some of the men were indeed\ntongue-tied(see last.issue), answering\nin monosyllables. Luckily others were\nmore vociferous; below are given some\ngeneral opinions:\nGenerally the women were quite\nsatisfactory, although \"warmth and home-lines s\" were lacking in most. Also\nthey needed to be more mature mentally,\ninferring that their physical maturity\nwas adequate. As one man put it, they\nwere \"often overexposed physically and\nunderdeveloped mentally\" However,\nsome of the men preferred them that way'\nLittle maternal instinct was evident in.\nthe majority of the females. Requests\nto \"come back to the digs to wash up\nand make me some coffee \" were severely\nrebuffed by such excuses as \"\nMummy would\nnot like it\", but, as we all know, Mummy would not get it l However, before a man asks a girl to his flat for coffee he has to find\nher. Although most men seek them at\nhops a few women appear in odd places\n\u2022On top of a bonfire\", \"In Lapland\",\nor even \"In bed.\" These rarities do\nnot detract from the problem of conversation at hops. Girls who answer\n\"Tes\" to \"Do you come hear often\" are\nto be avoided as there is obviously\nsomething wrong.\nSome men had original trends in\nconversation. \"Does Stravinsky bore\nyou?\" Or \"Are you pro-Osborne?\" \"Do\nyou like champagne and oysters?\" or\n\"If I tell you that you have a good\nfigure, will you hold it against meT\"\n\"Have you ever been to China? Tell, what a coincidence, neither have I.\" However, little suo o ess is reported\nwith the above open tags. One interviewee has had limited success with\na pas M rio q yn ln nl approach. It was\ngenerally felt that the girls should\nmake more attempts at conversation.\nCautioned en page t... "

    "content": "POINTS FROM COUNCIL The Union Counoil meeting on Monday,\nFebruary 3rd. was considerably shorter\nwan the previous one, ending at 7.30\nTh< sp roo ee ding a are summarised\noe low. The broken step on the central\nstaircase leading to the 3rd floor of\nthe Union was due to the dropping on\nit of the old piano during transit to\na children's Christmas party elsewhere\nin the College. Twelve other steps were\ndamaged. The broken one will be replaced at College expense.\nIn a further attempt to prevent\noverloading, the lift in the Union will shortly be fitted with a cunning gadget consisting of a siren that emits a high-pitched whine when the capacity is exceeded.\nOn the extra mural side, the cost of\nparticipating in Touchstone weekends is to go up from ten to fifteen shillings,\nand it is hoped that C. Day Lewis will give some General Studies lectures on\npoetry.\nThe Entertainments Committee reports\npoor organisation on the part of clubs\nrunning hops: some supervision seems to\nbe needed. Some of the doormen hired\nfor hops have been found rather unsatisfactory and it is hoped that 80Ile ge technicians may take their place.\nThe next Union meeting will be held\non the 6th of March.\nLIVELY DEBATING IN MOCK PARLIAMENT The seo on d Mock Parliament was\nheld in Ayrton Hall on Thursday,\nJanuary 30th. A Labour Government\nwas in office, and the Liberal Society\nprovided the official Opposition.\nBusiness opened with a statement of\npolicy by the Prime Minister, wh i oh was replied to by the leader of the\nOpposition.\nA Bill to repeal the Conservative\nGovernment's Rent Aot, and to introduce\nsome new measures on housing, provided\nacne interesting debating. The\nOpposition was somewhat divided, and\ndid not press for a division. The\nBill was therefore accepted unopposed.\nA debate on Education provoked\nsome violent debating on the subjects\nof the eleven plus exam, and the future\nof public schools, but general agreement was felt on the subject of students\ngrants* The Government promised to\ngive this matter sympathetic consider a tion. An Opposition motion of no confidence in the Government was defeated.\nThe final business on the order\npaper was a debate on nationalisation.\nThe Government proposed to national is e several industries, including the road\nhaulage and the coal distribution industries. A proposal by an independent\nM.P. to national is e wine, women, and\nsong was vociferously opposed by the\ntwo members of I. C.W. A. present.\nThe evening was enlivened by many\nInterjections of a varied and interesting nature. The Conservative Society\nunfortunately did not support this\nsitting of the Mock Parliament. The\nHouse hoped that they would attend\nthe final two sittings.\nFELIX S. C.C. APPROVES CONSTITUTION CHANGES The Social Clubs Committee held a Meting on Thursday February 6th. The\nmain items of business were two proposed\namendments to the constitution, both of\nwhich were approved. The first was that\nany proposed new so oie ty must gain the\nsupport of one half of the members present at a committee meeting while the\nsecond allows two alternative possibilities should the full formation of a Club or Sooiety be rejected:\n(a) The Society or Club shall be\nformed as a Minor Society of a suitable\nexisting Sooiety or Club. The Minor\nSociety shall be independent of the\nSenior Club, both financially and with\nregard to activities but shall be represented on the S. C.C. by the President or Chairman of the Senior Club.\n(b) The Society shall be formed as\nin (a) but shall be financially dependent on the Senior Club., and be named\na Sub-group.\nThe Committee wh s11, have the power\nto recommend to Imperial College Union\nCouncil that any club or sub-group be\ndisbanded if it considers that the interests of the Union demand it. The Photographic Society has been\nawarded a Pot in the Bar in recognition\nof their outstanding record - they are\nvery well known and have been asked to\nparticipate in international exhibitions,\nbesides carrying off many first places\nin U.L. exhibitions. Their own exhibitions have been Judged by prominent members of the photographic world, who\nhave complimented them on their work.\nThe Executive Committee of the S. C.C. has also revised the subscription rates\nof the Social, clubs, taking into account\ntheir membership and expenditure. Several changes were approved.\nCOL CUT T TOWER MORE BRIGHT IDEAS The request for ideas for dealing\nwith the Coloutt tower has brought to\nlight a wealth of originality; a selection\nfollows.\nDear Sir,I suggest that the Colcutt Tower\nbe exhibited in a \"thief-proof\"bracket\nin the entrance hall of R.C.S. Yours sincerely,\nAnthony L. Brookes.\nDear Sir,\nWhy not keep the Coloutt Tower\nin order that our President can\nhave a little room right at the\ntop in which to practice on his\neuphonium.\nYours faithfully,\nJudy Lemon.\nDear Sir,\nThe present outcry against the\nColcutt Tower amazes me. Has no\u2014one\nrealized what a tremendous asset we\nhave in our midst?\nThe entire skill of all three\nconstituent Colleges must immediately\nbe harnessed to the project of giving\nthe Tower a permanent tilt. This\nwould attract visitors from all over\nthe world and immeasurably increase\nthe prestige and revenue of the College.\nAfter all, who would have heard of\nPisa if its tower were straight?\nBut there would be a nobler scientific motive behind all this. It is quite possible that in the not-too-dis-tant future materials will be treated\nin such a way that they will resist\nthe force of gravity and be repelled\nby the earth. Research on these materials would inevitably include a study\nof the time they would take to rise\nvertically to a given height on being\nreleased at ground level. What better\nequipment could one want for this\nexperiment than the Leaning Tower of\nKensington?\nYours tilted ly, I.N. Guy.\nDear Sir,\nIt is generally acknowledged that\nthe Colcutt Tower must have additional\nsupports when the surrounding buildings\nare removed. One obvious way of doing\nthis is to build four flying buttresses\nat the corners of the tower to stabilize\nit. If the Reader will refer to the\ndiagram he will see that if the buttresses\nwere carefully designed they would give\nthe tower the appearance of a gigantic\nneolithic rocket.\nNothing could be a more worthy\nsymbol of the scientific work on the\nisland site. Further, it would evoke\ngreat astonishment and admiration from\noverseas tourists who never realized\nthat our entry into the field of ball is tic missiles had preceded the first automobile by half a century.\nPoignancy is added to the situation\nby the theory that the tower will gradually sink into the ground under\nits vast weight when the supporting\nbuildings are removed. As though\nwinding up for a huge leap into space\nthe tower (Colputnik I?) would disappear\nslowly from sight, with Mr. John\nBetjeman doing a smart salute on one of\nthe balconies as it went down.\nYours faithfully,\nNorman B. Greaves.\n- *\n\n"

VIII lost by a narrow margin after an intriguing race\nin which the crews kept stopping to\nwait for each other.\nThe races took place at Putney,\nbeing rowed on the rising tide. The\norder of racing was 3rd.,2 nd.,4 th.,1 st. VIII's. The first two races were\nrowed in pouring rain, and the last two\nin water which was rapidly becoming\nrougher as the tide rose.\nThe 3rd. VIII started well on Surrey\nStn. and were J length up on reaching\nthe Boathouse; going comfortably, they\nfinished the 1-mile course in 4m.46s. with a lead of 4 lengths. The End.VIII\ntook the Mddx. Stn. ,^nd had built up\na lead of \u00a3 - f length at Fulhara Football Ground where, no. 6 in the I.C. crew caught an enormous crab. By the\ntime he had recovered, the crew wa3 about 5 lengths down. The Reading\ncrew e as i ed and waited for the I.C. crew to recover, restarting about 2\u00a3\nlengths ahead of them. Despite a finishing burst of great ferocity, I.C. lost by the narrow margin of J length\nin a time of 8m,5s. for the Putney\nBridge to Hammersmith Bridge course.\nThe 4th. VIII were determined to retrieve the situation, and rowed a very\nworkmanlike race on the Surrey station\nto win by 4 lengths in 4m.47s. for the\n1-mile course - an excellent time for\na clinker boat.\nIfcanwhile the water had been getting\nsteadily rougher, and by the time the\nl st. VIII boated conditions were most\nunpleasant. Both crews got off to a good start, but the I.C. VIII had a lead of a canvas at the Boathouae.\nThey improved steadily on this and went\non to win by 3j lengths in a time of\n7m.40s. for the Bridge to Bridge\ncourse.\nOn the previous Sunday the four main\n\"fresher\" crews rowed up to Riohmond\nfor lunch, then paddled together back\nto Chiswick Bridge, from where they\nraced back to Putney. It was extremely\nencouraging to see the determination\nshown by these crews, only one of\nwhich had had previous rowing experience. Of necessity, rowing involves\nmainly weeks of training in preparation\nfor a few minutes racing; this often\ntends to discourage newcomers to the\nsport. But to those who persevere and\nachieve even a small degree ot success\ncomes the satisfying reward of overcoming the elements, which usually\nseem to conspire against one.\nFENCING CLUB I.C.

Published\n\u00a3 ~ . Printed by\nSOCCER: \u2022\nREPORT After the defeat by Southampton\nUniversity the l st. XI certainly needed to regain confidence in its ability.\nAlthough St.Hferk and St.John College\nare not among our strongest opponents,\nfor the first half they controlled the\ncourse of the game. Gradually the\nI.C. team overcame its lethargy and\nbecame more purposeful. Strong tackling by the defence and good combination among the attack converted a01 halftime deficit into a41 victory.\nThe next match, versus New College\nOxford, became a mere formality, as\nI.C. won easily by 7 goals to 2.\nKeith Codling and Harry Pidgeon obtained hat-tricks, which may prove\nexpensive for them at the annual\ndinner.\nRECTOR'S CUP BOXING CHAMPIONSHIPS\nFRIDAY21 ST FEB. CONCERT HALL\nIO'K ANNUAL HYDE PARK\nROAD RELAY MARCH !\u00ab 3p~. ATHLETICS The Club fixture-list for the coming\nseason is almost complete, and may be\nseen on the' notice-board. Attention\nis drawn to the first match - now only\n2^ weeks away - against U.C. on Wed.\n\".arch 5th.

April.\nThe official training period this\nterm is at Hurlingham Park Athletic\nGround on Sunday mornings at 11,00 am.\nCircuit training can still be carried\nout in the Snack Bar each afternoon\nafter College hours.\nSuch an easy victory was not a good\npreparation for the following League\nmatch against Westminster College.\nIn the first half, I.C. had more of\nthe play, but Westminster took advantage of two slips in the Harlington\nmud, and at halftime were leading\n2 - 0 . Although I.C. tried hard, even\nperhaps a little too hard, to even\nthe score, our efforts met with no\nsuccess. Late in the game Westminster\nscored one furthur goal, to make\nvictory absolutely certain. Our hopes\nof League honours are now considerably\ndimmed.\nHowever, the 3rd. XI, captained by\nGeorge Webster, now need only two\npoints from their remaining games to\nwin the division two championship.\nTheir promotion would mean that the\nI.C.2 nd. and 3rd, teams would compete\nin the same division next ses son, which would solve current speculation\nas to their relative merits.\nThe 4th. XI are in a precarious\nposition. After winning 12 League\ngames in a row, mostly by big margins,\nI.C. have lost twice to Institute of\nEducation, their chief rivals, and\npromotion is now doubtful. Having\nalready scored over a hundred goals\nthis season, the 4th, team deserve\nstronger fixtures for next season.\nSoccer Club record:\nP WDL FAl st. XI. 24 14 3 7 74 53\n2nd.

Conway waa 9th. after dropping a few places during\nthe last half mile of a very tough\nsix-mile course. The evening celebrations were more successful, and\nafter the last train had departed\nthree I.C. men, having abundant faith\nin the generosity of British motorists,\nstarted at 1.00 am. to hitch-hike to\nLondon, But lifts were scarce, and\nafter walking about 20 miles, and\nwaking the inhabitants of several\nWest Country villages with their sing-ing, they caught a train to London on\nthe Sunday morning.\nThe 2nd. team have at last succeeded\nin defeating Brentwood School, but\nonly by one point, and thanks to al st. team member who missed the train to\nBristol.\nOn 8th. Feb. a match with U.C. developed into a huge race with 10 strong\nteams competing, including Cxford II,\nSouthampton and Bristol. With heavy\n\u2022rain and thick mud the Parliament Hill\ncourse was at its worst. I.C. came\n4th. losing to Oxford, Southampton and\nL.S.E., but defeating our great rivals\nU.C. and Bristol.\nThe second team had a match against\nPearl Assurance and Lloyds Bank, over\na rather wet and muddy course at\nMaiden.
