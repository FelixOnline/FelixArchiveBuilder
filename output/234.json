    "content": "2 FELIX\nDanish success\nfor Dram soc\nDR/ VMS OC WENT on l our this\nyear for a fortnight to Denmark. We arrived by train in Naestved on the\nmorning of Sunday the 291'. August, having persuaded two girls on the\ntrain to accompany us to Denmark. We were met by two members of the\n\" Njestved Amato scene,\" whose members put us up for the first week. Organised to the \" n\"th degree our stay\ninvolved visits to a castle, the local newspaper and glass works and a civic reception. On Thursday and Friday nights we performed\" An Inspector\nCalls\" by J.B. Priestley, in the\nNaestved secondary school. The play\nwas well received by both press and audience. After the performance on Thursday the President of the Naestved Am at or scene presented the society with a really beautiful vase. Our stay culminated on Saturday with a splendid party, at which we were each\ngiven engraved glasses.\nOn Sunday we moved toNy ka ebing a town 4 0 miles South of Nx^t vcd, where we were entertained by the\nEnglish Club. Here again we were\nmet by an intelligent audience which gathered on Tuesday in the Ny ko bing grammar school.\nIncredible audience\nOn Wednesday the 8th ot Septem\nber we travelled by train to C open hagen. We played here before an in credible audience of over 600 people\nin the most modern theatre in Denmark. Although apprehensive the\ncast performed well and was favour ably received. Our three days were\nfully employed sightseeing inC open hagen including Tivoli Gardens and he Carls burg Brewery.\nWe left from Copenhagen on Sat\nar day,11 th September, happy but\nshattered.\nThey are in The Observer\nevery Sunday, yet\nAre these\nthe eyes of a madman?\nThese are the eyes of Michael Frayn. For seven\nyears now, week in, week out (apart from 4\nweeks' paid holiday a year), first in The\nGuardian, then in The Observer, Frayn has\nhad to write an article. 700 words 3 times a week for The Guardian; 900 words once a week in The Observer.\nHe has also written two novels, The Tin Men and The Russian Interpreter. Appeared\nregularly on Granada TV. Wrote for TW3.\nContributed to The Age of Austerity. He is\nalso married, with two daughters.\nYet there is still virtually no evidence that Frayn\nhas been affected by this. However a growing\nnumber of people read The Observer every\nSunday for this reason alone. To be actually\nthere, on hand, when he does finally \u2014 well\n\u2014 snap.\nRead The Observer every Sunday\nRumpus over \u00a3m.' Money lost' - reports\nTHERE WAS NO question of a treasury loan of \u00a31,000,000 being\nlost, said London University in\na statement during the vacation.\nThe statement followed suggestions in the national daily press\nthat the money was lost\u2014the\nnewspapers got their story from\nthe Second Report of the Committee for Public Accounts,\npublished last month.\nThe loan to the University was\ntowards the cost of buying property in Bloomsbury. The Committee said that the purchase of\nthe Bloomsbury Estate No. 2 was\nfinanced by an Exchequer loan\nof \u00a3lm. issued in 1950, a grant\nof \u00a3250,000 from the LCC and\n\u00a3336,000 from the University's capital resources. The loan was\nto be converted into grants as\nthe property was brought into\nuse for University purposes.\nThough this was basically a book\ntransaction, the intention was to\ngive the Treasury, the Department of Education and Science,\nand the UGC( University Grants\nCommittee) added control over\nthe development of the property.\nBELATED STEPS\nIn July 1965, the balance of\nthe fund, after repayment of the\nUniversity's original contribution,\nwas announced as \u00a3608,000. It\nwas subsequently shown that\n\u00a3499,000 of this was temporarily\nlent to OTHER University funds.\n\" We were informed that neither\nthe Treasury nor the Department of Education and Science had made use of the fund over the years; the matter had completely been lost sight\nof. The committee report states :\n\" The University Grants Commit tee had recommended grants for building developments on the estate\nin complete ignorance of the existence\nof the amount of money in it.\"\" Belated steps \" to see that money was used for the purpose intended\nINTERESTED IN: OWLS OCCULTISM ORATORY Then come to the HALDANE\nLIBRARY\n18 Princes Gardens for a book about it. Open l!7 pm. daily(115.30) Monday& Wednesday were welcomed by the Committee, which censored the departments concerned for disregarding their previous\nwarning in in1953. The University explained that the\nfund was still earmarked for its orig i nal purpose. Although the cash\nbalance had been temporarily diverted\nto finance other capital expenditure,\nit was\" covered\" by a bank loan arrangement, and was always avail able on demand. PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL? The University's statement does not deal with the P.A.C.' s chief complaint, that responsible Government departments \" entirely lost sight of the\nexistence and purpose of the fund.\" This resulted in grants being made from the Exchequer, which should have been financed from the fund. Nor does the statement deal with the\nPAC' s comment that the amount of grants might have been affected if the\nGrants Committee had known of the fund's existence.\nOne possible consequence is a fur ther step towards tightening Parliamentary control of the Universities \u2014\nlikely to be taken when the Vice Chancellor's committee presents evidence before the P.A.C. The Vice Chancellors were asked to appear in June after the U.G.C.' s discussion of the matter in, May. Furthermore, this\nmay affect UGC s future grant assignments to the University.

Among our most successful events in that\nmatch were the 1500m won by Howard Dickson and the relay where in spite of only having three regular\nsprinters we won the relay by a comfortable margin. Of course they did drop the baton.\nOn, then, the match against\nTubing en who, again some of us had met previously in London. Here too we were well entertained and only wished we were there for more than\ntwo days. The competition was one most eno jy able with a really friendly spirit and Dave at last overcoming his\nHoward Dickson breaks the tape\nin the 1500m at Mannheim.\nPhotos by Ian Winship\ntraining and winning a very tense\nhigh jump competition.

Starse of this meeting were Aberdeen University who in spite of two days\ntravelling wiped the floor with every-body. If we were outclassed on the sporting side we more than held our own on the 'sport' side at the reception that evening.\nAltogether it was a very enjoyable\ntour in which we made many friends\nand spread the image of I.C. abroad\n\u2014 but it should recover.\nF.D.

Activities include open\nwater meetings, an Easter camp in the\nSouth of France (which is open to\nfresher s) and at least one major ex-p edition. The Clubs Facilities include a van\nand a compressor as well as aqua-lungs, basic equipment (mask. fins,\netc) which can be bought at reduced\nprices.\nTraining starting at the beginning\nof term includes both baths sessions\nand lectures.

The crossing to Norway was short\nand calm, which was more than can\nbe said for our driving in Norway.\nThe vehicles made the 5000 ft. climb\ninto the heart of the Jotenhcim\nMountains without getting more than\na little steamed up. A base camp\nwas set up at Leirvassbu from which\nwe were able to climb at least a dozen\npeaks each within a day and a separate camp was set up at\nSpiterstuien from which the two\nhig est mountains in Northern Europe.\nGaldhoppigen and Glittertind (8.000\nft.), were climbed.\nAlthough the mountains were de-sert ed, we were in walking distance of\nLeivassbu and we met many Norwegians, mainly students, who taught\nus Norwegian songs and dances and\nin return we tried to teach them some\nof ours to our common amusement.\nOn the whole we were fortunate to\nbe \" lost \" in the mountains and yet\nstill make con act with the Norwegians.\nThe I.C. pair, Hobson and Dickson, keep in close contact\nwu h the opposition during the 1500 m at Mannheim.\nBANG!\nFACTS AND FOOTBALL\nGREETINGS TO ALL the new members of the club, and to\npresent members playing another season with us. The committee\nhopes the fresher s, especially, will settle down as soon as possible.\nTo begin with, the club is affiliated to the Middlesex F.A., from\nwhom we get two Cup Final tickets.\nThis year seven teams will be in the U.L. leagues, and also in the Cup competitions. To ensure an excellent\nchance of doing well, we want to establish settled teams as soon as pos-sib le, whilst preserving the opportunity for players of merit to 'move up'. Of course, this means that some play ers, who are 'off form' will have to forfeit their places\nIf all players are not lackadaisical\nin their approach to the game, the committee assures you that it will be doing its best to make you satisfied\nwith the club, and the two games per week you will get.\nApart from playing. soccer all season, there is the social aspect to lie considered and next Wednesday, after the matches, we have the' pie and mash supper' to beheld in the Union: details from the notice board.\nIn January and February, the Club Dance and the annual dinner are held with great success\nI hope your interest has been\ncaught and that you will endeavour\nto show keenness throughout the season.\nJ. Garratt\nFOR THE SECOND year running the college rifle club B' team won the University league.\nThe University full-bore and\np 'stol championship were also\nwon by club members. The ' A' team, however, slipped one\npotion further and ended up\nthird.\nThis year the club will be using the\nrange at Chelsea Barracks which should lead to an improved standard\nof shooting. It will also be possible\nfor more people to shoot more frequently and the club hopes to en courage more beginners to shoot. In the past few years the active membership of the club has been declining\nowing to the difficulty of allocating range time to others than team members.

She took up residence in the tiny office only last week,\nand so is unfamiliar with the routine.\nVivacious Pam adds a welcome\ntouch of glamour to the somewhat\nmonastic Union. She admits to a great interest in art and, according to\nVicePresident Dave McBain, is liable\nto be sketching on the walls.\nAlthough she was born in London, most of her life has been spent in Canada and she still retains a slight\nCanadian accent. While in Canada Pam worked mainly in Vancouver. Her return to England was made in1962 and she spent the year after\nher arrival\" travelling around.\" Since\nthen she has had various secretarial\nposts including on in an Eastern embassy. Pam was offered the post after answering an advertisement, though at\nthat time she did not know the exact\nnature of the job. We wish her the\nbest of luck in this often trying job.\nUNTIL 1964 ICU'S mascot wag\na brass eagle called Phoenix.\nThis was 'Lost' under very dubious circumstances, namely a drunken mascot officer, at the\nend of that year and there followed an unofficial adoption of\nQueen's Tower (c.f. University\nCollege). But this was generally\nfelt by the more active members\nof Wooden Horse to be a retrograde step, giving those whose\nmascots had been stolen by I.C. no chance to retaliate. So \"Mike\"\nwas born and it is solely due to\nthe organisation and practical\nability of Ralph Cornforth that\nthe ideas have become reality.\nHe found himself the sole person\ninterested after being let down\nby several people who had promised designs and assistance.\nBeginnings\nThe first term of last year was spent\npurely in organisation and in the collection of material. Mines evinced a willingness to cast the frame, if sufficient brass were supplied. The RS M rep. on the project, Jim McLeod, being a member of I.C. rifle club supplied the answer in the form of a hundred and fifty pounds of spent cartridges.\nHe then spent many happy hours melting these down into ingots ready\nfor the actual casting.\nMeanwhile overtures had been\nmade to various carpenters within the\ncollege to make a pattern for the casting of the frame. This was a tricky job, far beyond the capabilities of any of the students concerned, but a superb job was done by Stan Cook of\nthe Ci vEng workshop. In the meantime Ralph Corn forth had redesigned the micrometer! to\nenable it to be made more easily.\nFrom most of the major departments\n(Physics, Che mEn g,Ci vEng), but\nmainly Me chEng came steel bar and tube. This was melted and used to\ncast the frame in the RS M. foundry. It came out near perfect the first time and work was immediately begun\ncleaning it up. Ralph machined the\nframe and spindle himself, the finishing being done in the Civil andEl ecE ng workshops.\nThe org in al idea was to mount the\nmasterpiece on the window ledge in the concert hall, but this was eventually discarded and the lower lounge chosen. Here the college Main te nance Department was found to be\nmost helpful \u2014 they proceeded to cast\na ton of concrete in the lower lounge\nwhich was then formed into the\nplinth. The mounting and alarms required the construction of a safe door and frame \u2014 to be cast into the top part\nof the plinth. All these jobs were\ndone by the Wooden Horse club with much assistance from the Main te nance Dept. The engraving on the assembly was added by Ci vEng, being\ngraduated in division of .8in^( The\nUnion meeting decided Mike should be graduated in degrees.) Chromium plating was done by B.J. S. ElectroPlating Co. Under great secrecy du ring the long vacation the elaborate\nsafety measures were finished and it\nwill certainly take very considerable\nresources to crack or outwit Mike. Should it ever happen that human error allows Mike to be kidnapped the nI.C. should mourn the loss of London' s most sophisticated mascot.\nCROSSWORD This year the crossword puzzles are\nto be run on the lines of a com pet i tion. A cash prize of 10s. will be paid\nto the creator of the best crossword\npu x z le submitted each issue. The\nentries will be judged by our staff an''\ntheir decision is final.

Yet last year IC provided on a per capita basis, more of UL U's officers and executive than any other\ncollege, and more absolutely than all but one of them. The reason for this anomaly is that, unfortunately, many IC students do not\" manage \"\nto get t oULU on one of the three Freshers' evenings, know nothing about\nUL U except from hearsay, and thus become stubbornly anti Male t Street.\nOf those who do find their way there, despite the ignorance of taxi drivers,\nbus conductors and pedestrians, many like what they see, become addicted\nand stubbornly pr oULU. Certainly a balance between these two extremes\nexists.\nHowever, if you do manage to travel by London Transport from IC to UL U, at the reasonable cost of one shilling, you will find a thriving organisation. One which provides a magnificent swimming pool, squash,\nbadminton and gymnasium facilities, as well as a choice of over one hundred student societies\u2014complementary to those of ICU. How to get there\nGet t oULU: by bus : No.14 from the Victoria& Albert Museum, or : No.73 from the Albert Hall, by tube : Piccadilly to Leicester Sq. and then Northern Line to Good ge St. Station. From Good ge St. it is necessary to cross the road, walk down beside\nHeals and' along Torrington Place. The UL U building is on your right opposite Dillon' s University Bookshop. Note that the buses return to IC from a stop in Gower Street, outside RADA. A guide to the societies, and the location of their stalls in UL U during the Freshers' evenings is given below.

    "content": "FELIX5 THE LATE RECTOR SIR PATRICK LINSTEAD, CBE, FRS, who died suddenly on\nthe 24lh of September, had guided Imperial College through a crucial period of its history. A graduate of the College, he was a member of the Chemistry department staff until 1938, and gained\nan international reputation in organic Chemistry. He was then\nsuccessively Professor at Sheffield and at Harvard, Deputy Director\nof Research at the war-time Ministry of Supply, and Director of\nthe National Chemical Laboratory. He returned in 1949 becoming\nhead of the Chemistry department and Dean of the RCS; and was\nappointed Rector in 1955.\nHis scientific attainments and contributions to the development of\nUniversity education, (which included membership of the Robbins Committee), are well known. In South Kensington he will also be particularly\nremembered for his personal influences on the nature and quality of the\nmassive expansion of the College, which had been initiated under his pre-dec ess or, Air Chief Marshal Sir Roderick Hill. Steering through the complications caused by the retention of the Queen's Tower he sought to\nensure that the large new academic buildings were modern and functional\nbut would not \" astonish our neighbours and clash with the pleasant legacies\nof the past.\" Within them he successfully fostered the development of\nnew departments and fields of study, and of interdepartmental collaboration.\nOne of his earliest decisions was that residential expansion should have\nequal priority with academic building, and from this sprang the redevelopment of Prince's Gardens, which will eventually accommodate more than\none thousand students. His concern for the nurturing of a University\nenvironment was also shown by the opening of the Playfair and Haldane\nLibraries, in the expansion of the Harlington sports ground, by his active\nencouragement of the General Studies programme, and in the project to\nbuild a swimming pool and squash courts on the North side of Prince's Gardens, which is now under way.\nThe Rector was closely interested in the activities of the Union, (\" that\nbene fic i ent organisation\") and of its many clubs and societies. The addition of two storeys to the original Union building was carried out in\nthe first years of his rector ship. Subsequently he designated as \" Union Areas \" much space in South Side and in the College Block, (which is soon\nto be built); and he had prepared the ground for the necessary strengthening\nof the Union fi nanci es to accompany this growth. He gave strong support\nto such new enterprises as the Exploration Board and, with Lady Linstead,\nattended many social functions in the Union. His urbane after dinner\nspeeches on these occasions were enlivened by many adroit shafts of\nhumour, which were usually proceeded by a speculative glance at the\nceiling. He was always accessible for consultation with the President of\nthe Union, and maintained excellent relations with successive generations\nof student officers.\nSir Patrick was a humane man of wide sympathies and interests. His\nlong experience of the College enabled him to graft the new onto the\nhealthiest elements of the old, and it is sad that he has not lived to see the\ncomplete fulfillment of the design. Those who knew him feel his passing as\na personal loss.\nD r.K.E. WE ALE. THE WELLS CENTENARY THE CENTENARY of the\nbirth of HG. Wells is commemorated by a variety of public\nand college events. In December\nLord Snow is to give a special\nCentenary lecture in the Huxley\nBuilding when he will speak\nabout Wells die literary pioneer\nand scientific educator.\nEarlier this Autumn the BBC\nbroadcast a documentary television programme on Wells entitled\n'Whoosh'. In this three members of Wellsoc appeared briefly.\nThe biggest event in Wellsoc's autumn timetable is the Wells Week organised in honour of H.G. Wells\u2014\none of IC's most celebrated alumni.\nThe main feature of this week will be\n\" an Art of Science Exhibition,\" but\nthere will also be a dinner attended\nby Wells' son, G.P. Wells, and showings of four films based on H.G. Wells' books.\nThe Art of Science Exhibition is\nto be held from 7th to 11th November and is organised by Colin Phillips, room 637 Tizard Hall. All Union members may enter using the\nforms available around the college.\nEntries are invited for such categories as painting, sculpture, music,\nrobots, inventions, science fiction\u2014\nin fact almost anything will be con\nside red provided that the entry is a work of art inspired by science, incorporating scientific apparatus or\nproduced scientifically.\nA long list of distinguished scientists\nand artists has been invited to judge\nthe entries, each taking on an appropriate category. They will collaborate in judging any entries which do\nnot fall into a listed class. For a special predictions category, the entries will be buried, and twenty years\nhence the then Rector will be invited\nto judge which forecast has been most\nnearly fulfilled. The winner will then\nreceive his prize.\nWellsoc is again offering a full programme of weekly meetings. As usual the first meeting is a crowd-drawer, being a lecture with demonstrations on hypnotism., This is followed in later weeks by a discussion\nof the possibility of creating life, Hermann Bondi on cosmology, a lecture\non brain-washing and voodoo, and\nseveral other intriguing topics.\nThe Society's special study groups\nset up last year to investigate flying\nsaucers and ghosts will continue. The\nlatter group will become affiliated to\nthe society for Psychical Research.\nI know\na bank\nActually, as Shakespeare fans will recall, the bank\nthat Oberon was talking about was the sort\nwhereon the wild thyme blew. Just the thing for a midsummer night's dream no doubt but not nearly\nas much practical use to the student as the other kind of bank \u2014 the Midland, for example.\nThere's nothing difficult about opening an account with\nthe Midland, just a few simple formalities and the\nthing's done. Have a word with your local manager \u2014\nhe'll be very willing to help. And you don't have to\ngo to Athens for this bank, either. There's a branch\nof the Midland in every university city and town.\nMidland Bank\nTHE BANK THAT KEEPS AHEAD-ON YOUR ACCOUNT\nHEAD OFFICE: POULTRY, LONDON EC2\n\n"

    "content": "12 FELIX\nFELIX WEEKEND\nDEADLINE\nMascot\nReady\nMIKE, GIANT sized micrometer built in such secrecy last\nyear as mascot for ICU, is to be\ninaugurated (or should it be de-dic a ted) at the first IC Union\nGeneral Meeting of the year, on\nNovember 3rd. The secrecy has been maintained by the 'Wooden Horse'\norganisation (ICs movement for\nmascot ry of all kinds) under the\nleadership of Ralph Cornforth.\nThis task was all the more important because after IC's successful 'snatches' of mascots from\nKings, City University (then\nNorthampton College) and SOAS\nthey would have appeared highly\nridiculous if they had 'Lost' IC's own mascot before it was even\ncomplete. They also undertook\nthe entire design, manufacture\nand installation of 'Mike'.\nOld\nBuildings\nMike ranks undoubtedly as one of\nthe finest examples of student ingenuity in the country \u2014 not only is he\nfully operational, but he has a defence mechanism which according to\n\" Wooden Horse\" can never be penetrated. Its 170 lbs. of steel and brass\nwill lie on aH ton concrete plinth in the Union lower lounge, and is protected from any marauders by clamps\nand safes, and a highly complex electronic alarm grid. In fact, the Union asks us to make it clear that it can\naccept no responsibility for mi sad ven ture to any amateur mascot pirate.\nAlthough\" Mike\" will be permanently on show in the Union Build ing, he will be brought into Union General Meetings and other occasions\nas much as possible. Imperial College has a mascot to be proud of,\nand which should enliven the recently\nrather dull London mascot scene.\nFailures\nBy general assent last year was a good year in the Union, hence it was\nperhaps inevitable that there should be a large crop of failures. The exams have claimed victims from all parts of the Union; large sections of\nDram soc and Ents. Committee have\nfailed to return. The Carnival organisers, Jim Murray and Peter Jones,\nhave both failed, as has the chairman of Ents., Brian Compton. It seems\nprobable that Keith Guy, last year's Chairman of S CC and unsuccessful\ncandidate for the presidency will be\nnominated by Council as Chairman of Ents.\nFELIX has lost all of its most experienced staff and begins the year\nwith its youngest ever Editor. Note:D a i Howell set up a record last year. It was the first time he\npassed a year the first time! Sir Willis\nin the\nNews\nVery much in the news is Sir Will is Jackson, Head of the Electrical Engineering Department. Earlier this\nsummer he was appointed President\nof the British Association. As he is\nonly just taking on this post he has\nnot yet announced any intentions and will not deliver his Presidential ad dress until next summer. However it is\nreported that more time will be given\nat future meetings to symposia which will bring a number of disciplines\ntogether to discuss matters of common interest.\nOn October 31st Sir Will is is to\nchair one of the 1966 Granada Guildhall lectures. The speaker is Sebastian\nde Ferr anti, whose subject will be\n\" Technology and power.\" On November5 th, Sir Will is is to receive\nan honorary degree on the occasion of\nthe installation of the PrimeMinister, Mr. Wilson, as the first Chancellor of the University of Bradford.

New Hall WITHIN TWELVE hours of the announcement of the Selective Employ ment Tax, the college received requests\nfrom contractors whose tenders were\nunder consideration for review or\neven withdrawal of their tenders. These\nincluded the contract for the new hall development in Eastside.\nThe situation was critical because a stipulation of the anonymous benefactor was that work should begin before 21st May. Only by immediate negotiations was it possible to retain\nthe planned starting date of the 16th of May. Work is now continuing smoothly and the hall is due for completion for the Summer term of 1968. It is reported that during the Summer the\nwork compound has been broken into\nat night, possibly by students.\nFELIX This year FELIX finds itself\nwith a decimated staff.

When the members began to consider\nwhat he had accomplished in only eleven years, they found a proud\nrecord. In his preface to the current Union Handbook he wrote : \" this\nCollege is by general consent the leading College of Science and Technology\nin the country.\" It became so as a result of his brilliant administration\nand foresight. The College will long have cause to be grateful to him and\nto admire his achievements.\nChance of a lifetime\nOne idea which will be thrown at the Freshers in these first te w days\nis:\" You must strike a happy balance between work and play \u2014 both are important.\" By the time you have heard this from the President\n( Which one was he?) and your tutor ( Remember him well, he may never\nsee you again) you may well wonder( a) what the \u2014 does it mean and( b) what are they trying to sell?\nThe UL U handbook describes IC as having a highly independant\nunion \u2014 this is indeed true. Being such a large college it can offer many facilities in its own union for which smaller institutions must look back\nto UL U. It is also one of the few colleges not affiliated to the National Union of Students and has on occasions acted as an independent voice for students, e.g. the loans lobby of Parliament last May. IC Union has an advantage over most other Universities in that it is a medium-sized body comprised of three smaller bodies and itself part of a large body. The large body is UL U and the three smaller ones the\n\" constituent college unions \" \u2014 note that phrase, it is a local clich e. It\ncan thus provide opportunities for people of all abilities. The ambitious may find their niche in the corridors of. Male t Street ( UL U), those content\nwith a smaller sphere of influence will find ample opportunities to display\ntheir talents in the corridors, stair-cases and lift shafts of IC. For those\nwho prefer an even tighter knit company, the constituent college unions have many flourishing and influential organisations.\nAs for striking a happy balance this obviously means different things\nto different people. Some can be a President of a society and get a First, others can do nothing and still fail. In your first weeks experiment, find\nout what you can allow for work! Seriously though, it's no good hiding away and saying you will enjoy yourself after you graduate \u2014 now is the\ntime of opportunity.\nYou will no doubt have joined some of the seductive societies you saw on Freshers' Day. Possibly your attitude was\" I want to join the FolkSong Club because I like to listen to folk music.\" or \" If I join the Photo graphic Society 1 can use their darkrooms.\" While not un commendable, these are not the best reasons for joining. Any kind of society depends for its success on the activity and in vol v ment of its members\u2014please get\ninvolved! Don't imagine you can step into a society >as President ( Vice President possibly) but you can give your ideas, help and time right from the1 start. There is no need to be afraid of being turned away as a\" Fresher \" \u2014 you are only a Fresher as long as you act as one. There are\nno closed shops \u2014 all doors will open if you push hard enough \u2014 and it is time a few people did start pushing: the sweet drug of apathy may easily\novercome this fertile college.\nObviously you know best where your interests lie, but do not neglect\nto broaden your outlook \u2014 your real talents may still be latent. There are\nopportunities for everyone, boredom should be an impossibility. Top of the Union\nIN THE UNION we have the making s of a successful administration. Undoubtedly the power lies with President Tony Duke. He has already\nshown himself capable of employing his powers and directing it to useful\npurposes. At the time of writing (28th)I suspect he has some schemes for making large changes in the Union affairs.\nDavid McBain, VicePresident, is a hardworking diligent officer.\nAlready he has made efficient use of his limited time( he is a third year\nengineer) to implement the recommendations of the Council decision on notice boards.\nSecretary Brendan Parker is another hardworking member of Duke's staff. He worked hard under Fletcher last year to gain this post and no doubt learned much from this teacher.\nA Good\nBeginning.\nK \u00bbswi uia a e ep sense of loss\nthat we start the year after the\nsad death of the Rector, Sir\nPatrick Linstead. Although he\nwas an eminent scientist and administrator he will be remembered by the Union for the interest\nhe snowed in student affairs.\nAt this time it is vital for us to\nmaintain the high standards in\nthe life of the College of which\nwe are proud. We must show\nthat we are a strong and united\nUnion by our sense of loyal t; and responsibility. We must try\nto do this without dampening cor\nspirits. We are a rare example of\na self-governing Union, we must\nnot lose any of the advantages\nwhich this gives ns.\nAs an executive one of our\nmain difficulties is one of com-muni cation. In a college of this\nsize it is difficult for us to keep\nin touch with the ordinary mem-be rs. We do our best through\nFELIX and Union meetings, and!\nthe notice boards. The Union\ncaters for most interests but it is\nup to yon as the ordinary member\nto make the effort to get to know\nwhat is going on and where.\nIn conclusion, may I welcome\nyon all to the start of the new\nsession,.and from now on it's all\nyours!\nTony Duke\nPresident ICU\nMike\nSir,\nDuring the past year I have been\nresponsible for the construction of MIKE, I.C.'s new mascot.\nI would now like to express my personal thanks to the under mentioned members of the college staff,\nwithout whose help the construction\nof rf either the mascot or its plinth would have been possible : \u2014\nMaintenance: Mr. Lewis, Mr. Shurety, Mr. Dee ring and Mr. Fred Cox. Me ch.Eng.: Johnny Morgan, Gordon Stab in, Bob Garm on and Arthur Dowd en.C i v.Eng.: Mr. Bran an, Dept. Supt.\nStan Cook, carpenter ; Mr. Scott,\nworkshop. Elec. En g.:Mr. Green, workshop. Royal School of Mines: Mr. Harris, Dept. Supt.; Bert West, workshop; and, of course, Mac, in the foundry. My thanks also go to the few students involved: Roger Cross, Jim McLeod, Dick Conn, Paul Ward and Peter Mason. R.N. CORN FORTH. That Crowd\nAgain!\nSir,\nAt the end of last term, a private\nparty was held in the I CW A lounge.\nAt11.15 p.m.( closing time), the party\nwas invaded by over twenty people,\nmembers of what can be termed the\nbar crowd. The rowdiest and most\nobjectionable were asked without success to leave. After about an hour, some of the gatecrashers created a disturbance and a brawl broke out in which furniture was sent flying and glasses and bottles smashed. After wards,, one of the invited guests, who had tried to stop the fight amongst\nthe gate crashers, was taken to hos-pital. He had three stitches put above his eye and was found to have a broken nose.\nPerhaps the most appalling aspect\nthis affair is that it was not an isolated incident. Throughout the\nwhole of last year, a continuous series\nof complaints were made through these columns about similar inc idents involving the \" bar crowd\" \u2014\nthe breaking up of parties, destruction\nof Union and Hall property, and vandalism in general.\nAs yet, despite the frequency with which these incidents occur, no official action has been taken. Is the\nUnion completely powerless to act in these cases\u2014or merely unwilling? J. P.P OY SER. Obituary\nSir,\nI doubt if you will have heard of the death of Mike Neville Polly last\nmonth in Zambia. Having only left\ncollege last Christmas there will be\nmany of Mike's friends still in I.C. who will not have heard of this\ntragedy either.\nMike took a degree in Mechanical Engineering before coming to us in Mining for aDIC by research. He had a wide number of friends in both parts of the college, who, Iam sure,\nwill miss him greatly.\nHe went to Zambia as a Me chan ical Engineer at C hingol amine in the\nNew Year. Mike died in a road accident when returning from a rug ger match at\nChing ola one afternoon. Their small sports car hit a horse when doing more than 50 m.p.h. The animal was thrown over the bonnet and through the windscreen. Mike was severely\ncon cussed with internal bleeding around the brain. He died in hos pi tal after being unconscious for five\nweeks. His companion escaped virtually unharmed. Iam sure he will be missed by many in the college. You may rem ember him as a past captain of I.C. Boxing Club. J.

    "content": "FELIX\nWEDNESDAY'. 5 OTOBER 1966 Nr. 234\nFEATURE\nON MIKE p.7H ALL PRICES\nDOWN\nIN NOVEMBER ol 1965 it\nwas announced by the Halls of\nResidence committee that Hall\nfees would be raised by 5/- per\nweek i this rise to take effect\nfrom August of this year. The\naim was to eliminate a deficit in\nthe reserve funds of \u00a31200. It\nwould have brought the fees in\nSouthside up to \u00a381 p.a. The University of London has\ndecided, however, in view of the\nPrices and Incomes freeze, that\nsuch increases cannot be made.\n(The University being a Government financed body.) The fees\nthus remain at the level decided\nin 1962/63, e.g. Southside \u00a375,\nNew Beit \u00a368 p.a. The same freeze applies to all refectory charges which would pro b ably have risen to keep up within creased taxation and other charges.\nDr. Ken We ale said that the Selective Employment Tax would have to\nbe paid for all the cleaning and refectories staff but, since the Union is\na charity, the tax would later be re funded.\nNote: Because of the current credit\nsqueeze Hull, Exeter and some other\nUniversities have announced cut-backs\nin their building programmes. Its\neffect on1 C is as yet unknown. Pulteney\nFor all Hie\nbest in paperbacks\n22 Thur loe St SW7 CARNIVAL\n\u00a31001 4s7d was the sum handed\nover to the Notting Hill Housing Trust (last year's charity) by\nthe IC Carnival this month, despite the statement to Union\nCouncil by last year's president\nAdrian Fletcher that it had raised \u00a31,500.\nThis poor showing puts Carnival back to 1961, when the Charity was Oxfam, since when over \u00a31000 has\nbeen raised every year, culminating in \u00a32,417 in1965( also for the Notting Hill Housing Trust). Chris Hocking, last year's Carnival Chairman, when asked to comment on Fletcher's figure\nof \u00a31,500 said that the fall was due to shortage of staff, choosing the same\ncharity twice, and went on to suggest\n\" that the ambiguous comments I made at the beginning of the year probably did not help.\"( For the benefit\nof Freshers, last year's charity was chosen amidst a lot of ill-feeling. The Carnival Board and Union Executive effectively told the Union to choose the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, \u2014 the third candidate being the Family Planning International Campaign, proposed by the Huxley Society). With the failure of the appointed Chairman of Carnival Commit ee for this year, the outlet for Carnival is cloudy, but it is suggested\nthis week that Ralph Corn forth,( of\nWooden Horse Club fame) should take over the Chairmanship. This, together with the clarification of the\nconstitutional position of the Carnival Committee( formed eight years ago as\nan offshoot of the London Students'\nCarnival, which went into liquidation last year) may perhaps help IC's Carnival to regain its lost ground. BOOK SALE THE C&G UNION will be organ ising a text book sale on Tuesday the\n11th October at 1.00 in Me ch.Eng. People in Guilds who wish to, may leave them in the entrance of Me ch.Eng. during the lunch hour on Thur s day, Friday and Monday.

RECTOR\nDIES\nOn Wednesday, 21st September, Sir\nPatrick Linstead was suddenly taken\nill and was rushed to St. Georges\nHospital. His death occurred late\non Thursday night. It was thought\nthat he was in excellent health and his\ndeath came as a complete surprise to\nthe College. The pro-Rector, Sir\nOwen Saunders, will handle the essential affairs, such as Freshers' Day, for the college, A Memorial Service\nis to be held, and details will be announced later.
