    "content": "CLUBS& SOCIETIES Underwater Club\nEVER FANCIED finding sunken treasure? Raising the Titanic? Wresting giant squid? Yes? Well, we're the club for you! The most glamourous club in College, you can easily recognise a nICU C diver. The male of the\nspecies is a strikingly handsome brute usually wearing a black bobble hat( minus bobble of course!), well ies and has a magnificent French accent a la Cousteau. He can often be heard commenting about how wonderful it is to be so close to nature(' nature' being one of our women divers who has a love of rubber wear!). The female drives non diving mortals to distraction. Rising majestically from the surf,\nwet suit glistening in the sun, hair blown in the breeze she is immediately surrounded by cringing males begging to carry her lungs or other' equipment'! Yes indeed people, join ICU C and obtain charm, personality and charisma beyond your wildest dreams! With all the fantastic people to\nlook after, our safety record is\nstreets ahead of the other adventure clubs in College. It doesn't cost\nthe earth to be transformed from a normal student into a Godlike ICU C diver, we have the equipment, we also have our own dive boat lovingly known as the MV Cala pso. If on the other hand you find the idea of godlike status too\nheady you can at least be seen in the company of divers by playing Octopush. This is a form, pf underwater hockey played in the safety\nof a pool. It doesn't require too much training yet keeps you remarkably fit. Our team has reached the quarter finals of the\nnational championships for the past few years, but we aim to do better this year. Hopefully we will also find the few women still needed to have the making s of a good women' steam. If you want to hear more about ICU C listen for the French accents on the Queens Lawn during Fresher s' Fair. For gods, we're very approachable! Alternatively we are putting on a slide\nshow of underwater photography on Tuesday6 th October in Zoology. Simply come to Be it Quad and follow the signs.\nThe first pool session is on Thursday2 nd October at 7 : 0 0 pm in the College Sports Centre.

Mathematics - at all levels.\n-Electronics - mainly at C SE level. Travel Expenses\n\u2014 based on tube fares are paid to\ntutors.\nContact Alan Rogers, Ele c Eng3, or leave a message on9404466. ICCA G ICCA G is the Imperial College Community Action Group. The' Action' Group sounds a bit\ndumb but the idea is simple. A lot of people( especially old ones) don't actually go to discos\nevery five minutes, but do find\nthey can't manage easy things like\nshopping and gardening. They are sometimes just plain lonely. A lot of people who don't have homes which is something we are not even setting out to stop however, as they lie in the streets,\nas often as not at nights, they are still in need of help. A cup of soup, some bread and some biscuits at about midnight really can cheer them up.( Actually they aren't normally that dejected, but sometimes they are cold and wet.)\nI 'll spare the drivel( maybe I 've\ndrivelled already), so if you would like to help someone( i.e. get off\nyour butt) come to our 'office'\n( which is not' our' office) during a Monday lunchtime at about1:00 pm, that' s when we hold meetings. By the way, my proofreader has pointed out that I haven eg elected to disclose the whereabouts of the above office. It'son the top of the Union Building, follow the signs.\nDancing Club\n\" TO DANCE or not to dance?\" \u2014 that is the question. By the end of this article I hope you will have decided to join one of the largest\nand most active clubs at Imperial \u2014 namely the Dancing Club. General teaching classes start at\n7 : 3 0 pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for beginners and on Mondays for dancers who already know the\nbasics and want to learn more intricate steps. The lessons last until9:00 pm, and then there is a further period where people practice what they have learnt in the lesson during the general dancing. The beginners will learn about the movement and the steps\nin the following dances: social foxtrot, waltz, quickstep in the\nballroom section, and chach a, rumba and jive in the Latin section. A few ' party' dances are also taught, e.g. the gay gordon s, and the dashing white sergeant. The Monday night dancers will learn the above dances and also dances which are too difficult to\npickup easily, like the foxtrot, tango, samba and pas ci doble. The lessons are taken by qualified teachers. For those who would like to\nprogress faster than the general classes allow, there will be the opportunity to take dancing medals. The medal classes ( PDT, bronze and silver) will take place on the same nights as the general dancing and will start at 6 : 3 0 pm and goon until9:30 pm. The PDT( Popular Dance Test) is\nthe first grade and will beheld on Wednesday. The bronze medal will be held on Tuesday and the silver medal on Monday. The PDT is open to everybody, the bronze and silver classes will only be for those who have danced before. The classes will culminate in March with an examination by examiners from the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. Apart from the regular weekly events, the club organises an annual Christmas Dinner and Dance, trips to other college and public dances, and hopefully, this\nyear will visit the British Dancing Championships. Also, every year, there are two annual inter university dancing competitions. The club enters a team for these\nevents.\nAll in all, it's been one hell of a year and this one will be better.\nSo come along on the specified evenings to the J CR,S her field Building. If you want more information please do not hesitate\nto contact one of the following\npeople: Charlie Angus, Chem with Man Sci3( President); Steven Palmer, Che mEng2( Treasurer); Chris Watts, Aero3( Secretary); Simon Carter, Che mEng2( Publicity).

    "content": "Letters, and indeed all copy for\nFELIX, should be neatly written and double spaced. Names and dept. must\naccompany all letters otherwise they\nhave n't got a cat in hells chance of ending up in print. However, these\ndetails will be with eldora pen name substituted if required. Correspond ance is invited on all topics; there will be no censorship but the editor reserves the right to chop up letters to make them fit ( and still\nretaining the original meaning). Sir,\nHaving recently been a recipient of the so called\" RCS Handbook\" I was appalled to see to what depths this formerly illustrious publication has sunk. Are we really to believe that all the RCS Officers are imbeciles and sexual deviants who serve no better purpose than to continue an outmoded and decrepit tradition for another year? This is certainly the impression I get. Does this appalling Mark Smith person believe he can tamper with RCS and not get himself into considerable bother? Does he suppose he is above the unwritten law? A cursory glance through this\nrag left one with the distinct impression that all the articles were penned by the same person writing under different pseudonym sAmI far wide of the mark, when I suppose that Mr Smith himself is responsible for the horrible slurs\nin the characters of the people who have given up their sparetime to beR CSU Officers? Or perhaps one or some of his cronies\" created\" the insidious profiles under this\n\" Editor's\" direction. That the stalwarts of one of our college's student unions should be so stabbed in the back, fills me with hatred and loathing. I think a lifesize picture of Mr Smith should be pinned to the wall of\nthe RCS Office and everyone entering there in should be obliged to throw darts at it. Can he not be ostr aci sed by R CSU? If I were Richard Archer I would comedown extremely heavily on this abominable person. Is \" Motion of Censure\" too' strong a phrase to use? I can think of at least twenty two good reasons why the most heavy penalties should be brought to bear, but it would be too tedious to list them here. So Is hall refrain I hope my words do not go unheeded for this is indeed asad day for us all. Tours sincerely,\nD.P. Dear Steve\nThanks very much for the copy of FELIX, I love the masthead \u2014\nI only wish we could afford four colours.... A few points on your piece on London Student. Firstly, I doubt it\nSennet even in the halcyon days of1971 had a circulation of100,000. It's more likely that they were distributing20,000 and claiming a readership of five students to each paper. Secondly, Imperial has in fact\nsubscribed to London Student for\ntwo hundred copies a week, not three hundred. Thirdly, I would check a bit before claiming the largest circulation if( and I don't think it will) London Student folds. PCL' s McGarel\nCity Poly' s Pepys and University College's Pi all spring to mind as\nhaving about the same circulation as FELIX. Back to FELIX, I like the Fishy Tales column( are you going to describe the colour scheme of your office in it?), but have no idea what PG Tips is supposed to\nbe about.... Hope you have nice holiday. Best wishes\nPaul Segal\nEditor of London Student\nDear Paul,\nThanks for your letter.\nI don't like your masthead in the\nslightest and I wish I could afford four\ncolours too.\nA few points on your letter in FELIX. In my original article, I said\nthat Sen net had claimed a circulation of100,000 per week in 1974. They worked out that after printing40,000, each copy was read by2.5 people.\nThis caused the editors of other\nLondon student newspapers to attack\nSennet for diverting advertising revenue away from them by this\nludicrous circulation figure. In reply,\nSennet's advertising manager is on record as saying:\" You' re being too\nhonest\" and\" You are approaching advertising too fairly and squarely.\" I concede your second point but hope that you are not going to claim a readership of4,500 at I C,i.e.22.5 people per copy. Thirdly, I would have thought you were n't correct. For instance, Pi\nsprings to mind as not being a weekly\nnewspaper. Best wishes,\nSteve Marshall\nEditor of FELIX\nSir,\nIn your last issue(559) the article from John Whitehouse( PG Group Chairman) complained about the grant received by PG Group from the Union \u2014 supposedly.30 p from a \u00a3 3 9 capita tion fee. Mr Whitehouse seems to have overlooked the fact that the Postgraduate Group gets this grant over and above the other facilities that the Union provides. The \u00a3 3 9 capita tion fee paid to the Union goes to providing facilities\nfor sports, clubs and societies, for CC Us, for FELIX and for the many other wide and varied bits\nand pieces.\nAlso for the number of people who actually participate in the PG Group, enthusiastic as they may be, I would say that those\nfew get much more than the30 p suggested. I would therefore like to invite Mr Whitehouse and the many uninvolved PCs to set their own house in order before they start\ngriping about their grant. The alternatives are: i) to get rid of the PG Group altogether or ii) to set up an undergraduate group(?) \u2022\nJ Passmore\nWhile you were away Thief in Sherfield\nMr John Smith, the College Secretary, arrested a thief in his\noffice on21 st August. The thief was observed leaving with Mr Smith's wallet sticking out of his trousers.\nThe case has now been heard in court and the thief has been imprisoned for six months. Round at the Queens\nOn17 th July, such big knobs as\nChris Fox, Sea nO' Boyle, and Jo Armitage together with other assorted guests went off to a Buckingham Palace Garden Party in the motorised mascots J ez and Bo.A goodtime was had by all! Comings and Goings\nAt the beginning of August, Mr Geoffrey Reeves tookover the post of Chief Security Officer after\nthe death of Mr Dawson last term. Mr Reeves is a former Scotland Yard Chief Superintendent whose son studied at Guilds. Mr John Sam worth, the Bookshop Manager, has now retired. A new manager will not be appointed; the Bookshop will run itself with the aid of a small computer. Last Post\nFinally, when you go to post your letter by the RCM you will be surprised to see that the postbox has been removed. Over the road you will see one of the very first of the GPO' s revolutionary new' K type' pillar box. The PostOffice intends, over a period of years, to replace all existing pillar boxes with the K type. We at FELIX are not impressed.

The standard\nof the four teams regularly playing\non Saturday afternoons varies\nfrom the 1st XI playing league\ngames twice weekly with training\nevery Tuesday (indeed all Club members are encouraged to\nattend these sessions) through to\nthe 4 th XI whose games are\nplayed in a more social atmosphere.\nThis season for the first time\nthe 2nd XI will be playing in a league and this will increase the\nopportunity for players to play\nleague hockey.\nThe Club has the use of sporting\nfacilities at Hariington, to which\ncoaches are provided, leaving the\nUnion Archway. These facilities\nconsist of four excellent pitches,\ngood changing facilities and a bar\nfor POST match refreshment.\nThis season, numerous social\nevents have been arranged, such\nas Pies & Mash, Dinner, and Pizza-Night; it is hoped that with\nsuitable support these will become\nregular events.\nAnyone interested should come\nalong to our stall at Freshers' Fair\nor report with your kit on Wednesday or Saturday lunchtimes at\n1 : 0 0 pm in the Union Lower Lounge; ask for Pete Hughes.\nMixed Hockey\nDURING recent seasons the\nMixed Hockey side has had few\ngames due to inclement weather\nand a shortage of lady players.\nThis season however with some\nfine fixtures arranged we hope to\nbe playing more often.\nThese matches on Sundays are\nof a sociable nature against teams\nsuch as Guinness (with laid on\nsupplies of stock), Bank of England\n(without similar free gifts) and it\nis hoped two tournaments \u2014 the\nWorthing Penguin Weekend and\nanother still being arranged.\nIt is hoped this year to provide\ntransport to all venues by either\ncar or minibus.\nInterested?

It was a cold grey Saturday\nmorning as two vans and one\nmoped headed south-west. After\nalmost half of the journey had\nbeen completed we stopped at\nLymington to play our first match\nof the tour against Lymington Swimming Club. The match was\nto take place in an, open air seawater pool, however the opposition\nrefused to play, because: a) the\nwater was too cold; b) it started\nraining heavily; and c) there was\nnot enough water in the pool because the pump had failed.\nNevertheless the match took\nplace at New Milton Swimming\n. Pool. Phil Mills and Barry, scored two goals in the first\nquarter and Nick Buckland scored\nthe third goal as his farewell present\nto the club. However Lymington\nfought back and equalise d in the\nthird quarter and at the same time\nJim Williams was the first IC player\nto be sent off during the tour. Phil\nThwaites scored two more goals in\nthe final quarter, so we won our first\nmatch 5-3.\nWe stayed at the Sandy Holmes\nCaravan Site outside Weymouth.\nWe played our second match, the\nmost difficult, on Tuesday against\nBournemouth City. The score at\nthe end of the first quarter was 2-2, Steve Taylor and Phil Mills\nscoring two goals. In the second\nquarter Cliff Spooner scored two\ngoals (one from a penalty). Barry\nscored another one and our goalie\nDave saved a penalty. Therefore\nwe established a good lead over,\nour opposition and they never\nmanaged to catch up with us.\nPhill Mills and Cliff scored two\nmore goals and the final score was\n7-5 to us.\nThe third match was held at\nBovington Army Camp against\nthe Junior Leaders. Their team\nwas rather inexperienced and Dimitri, Pat, Nick Last, Phil Sinclair and John Hee fer son scored five goals in the first quarter. During the rest of the\ngame our scoring slowed down,\nhowever Jim Williams scored a goal after putting a great deal of\neffort. The final score was 9-4 to\nus.\nOn Thursday we had our final\ngame against Bridport SC at West\nBay. We played in the river, which was extremely cold. Phil\nMills and Phil Thwaites scored a hat-trick each and Barry scored\nthe seventh. Final score 7-2 to IC. The whole tour was a resounding\nsuccess, both in the pool and out.\nWe kept up the excellent reputation\nof the Club and the college by not\nlosing a match.\nThe team was: Jim Williams,\nCliff Spooner, Phil Mills, Nick Buckland, Phil Thwaites, Dimitri\nPapaconstantinou, Dave Roberts,\nPat Porter, Barry As win. Nick Last, John Heffer non, Steve Tayler, Phil Sinclair and Amir Abdul. Dimitri\nResults Service\nFELIX would dearly love to provide an efficient results service for its\nsports mad readers. This relies on all club captains (or equivalents)\nbringing in results of Saturday games by 5:30pm Monday and\nWednesday games by Wednesday( yes, the same day!). Your cooperation would be appreciated.\nIf there is insufficient response we shall brand you all as wan kers and drop the sports page which the Editor hates anyway.\n\u2022 A person emerging backwards on the tip of a polaris missile at Rabion, FRANCE.

These motley folk shuffle around the Union East Staircase tired and red eyed after an evening's work on the stage or late night carousing in' The Storeroom', their workshop two and a half floors up. Occasionally, however, vitality floods through them and the Society puts on two main productions a year, accompanied by a one night show during Rag Week, and a tour in the summer, extraneous activities often take place such as theatre trips, and come the spring, theatre workshop sessions.\nA spokesman speaks: \" We need actors and stage crew, especially people interested in sound. Come up to the Union Concert Hall during Fresher s' Fair( or whenever) and you can have a guided tour and a cup of tea, you' ll be very welcome.\" Brecht\nTHE CHRISTMAS production is The Threepenny Opera by Bert old Brecht.

I have not yet met anyone who has not tried this form of recreation. Yet for some reason \u2014 arguments seem a bit pointless \u2014 noone ever seems to get his/ her point across. So the idea of debating came up \u2014 an argument with a difference \u2014 other people decide who wins! Well, a tIC the Deb Soc is\nhoping to present some issues this\nyear that perhaps you have or you have n't discussed/ argued before.

Freshers' Fair\nThis is where the most of what we do offer you is on show, with about100 clubs and societies trying to grab your attention. Please have a good look around and feel free to put your name down for lots of things; after all, they' re not allowed to take any membership fees at Fresher s' Fair, so you' ve got nothing to lose. There will be stalls throughout the Union Building and S her field Refectory/ Queens Lawn area, and the bars on both sites will be open all afternoon for your refreshment. Please don't come before2:30 pm, however, as everyone will still besetting up. Stall holders should have received details( check your letter racks!) \u2014 if not please come and see me. Amap and alphabetical list of societies is inserted in this issue of FELIX. Crash Pad For those of you unfortunate enough to still have nowhere to live, you can get a camp bedin the Union Building for50 pa night, just turn up at Be it Archway at 1 1 : 0 0 pm, suitably armed with a sleeping bag. Security\nI don't want to be alarmist, but after the very unfortunate incident when a Southside occupant was raped last term, I would urge the women amongst you not to wander around alone, especially late at\nnight( there are plenty of people around to walk you home from the Bar!).I' d also advise checking who is in the lift before you step\nin it and don't if it's a suspicious stranger. Southside Bar\nIn the ICU Handbook it says\" The main bar is a passage with a bar down one side . . . there is\nno atmosphere whatsoever...\" This was certainly true, but by the time you' rereading this the extensive re decorations should be finished, and you will be able to relax in a nicely lit, pub type atmosphere and enjoy your real ale. So rush along to see the new look South sideBar( and don't forget to buy the Exec a pint while you' re there). That' s all for now, no doubt I'll have lots more to say in the next issue. If you' ve any queries or problems, don't hesitate to ask, or just come and say hell otome in the Bar. Cheers\nRae\nConstituent College Union sC&G Motor\nClub\nCome and visit the City and Guilds College Motor Clubs tall. We are next to Boon the Queens Lawn, and have got the privately built Le Mans racing car, of Mr Alain DeCade net, on display. This has been specially lent to us\nfor Fresher s' Fair by Mr deCade net.

MC Turner\nCAPTAIN C&G YET ANOTHER welcome to the wonderful world of Imperial College, this time extended mainly to those of you with a more practical leaning(?) i.e. engineers, hereafter referred to as\nGuilds men. Welcome Guilds men. City and Guilds Union has plenty to offer you, in fact almost everything except a President. Not content with leaving us minus the' man at the top', the powers that be also saw fit to sweep our able bodied treasurer from our midst.. Therefore, the diverse entertainments planned for you by Guilds now include the elections of President and Hon Junior Treasurer. You will find more details of the elections in Guild sheet. The first Guilds event is the Fresher s' Reception, held this afternoon in the Union Concert Hall. It is vital that you attend \u2014\nan excellent opportunity to rub shoulders with many illustrious Guilds men, and guaranteed to cater for all manner of tastes. Having received and welcomed you we then proceed to the next Guilds event... the Women's Reception on Wednesday night in the Union Office, all Guilds women fresher s are invited to come along. Having finally tired of welcoming you, we plunge straight into entertaining you. An Ents Concert on Thursday night is close jy followed by a bar night on Friday, to leave you breathless and staggering after a hectic first\nweek at college. Sara McGmness\nC&G Hon Sec\nOH FUCK! How do you start\nthese articles( Not with 'Oh fuck'\n- Ed). Should I be overwhelmingly effusive and welcome you so often that you' re sick to the back teeth of it all? Should I try to convey the impression that R CSU is the greatest thing since sliced bread? Or should I merely give the facts?\nWell, the facts are as follows:\nMonday 29th September is Fresher s'U GM in the Great Hall at 2 : 0 0 pm; Tuesday 30th September the RCS stall will be at the Fresher s' Fairall afternoon and in the evening there will be a Fresher s' Pub Crawl \u2014 meet in Stan's between6:00 pm and6:30 pm; Saturday 4th October there will be the annual Tiddlywinks down Oxford Street \u2014 meet in the R CSU Office between9:30 and10:00 am; Sunday\n5th October is the Bar Night in the Union Bar at 7 : 0 0 pm. Those are the events for the first week. Other forthcoming events will be published in FELIX, in Broadsheet and on posters around College. Finally, I will just mention the dates of the Fresher s' Dinners. These are: Chemistry: Tuesday7 th October Maths: Friday10 th October Physics: Tuesday14 th October Life Sci: Friday17 th October Tickets for these are available from social reps and dep reps and also from Union Officers. Oh, and by the way, welcome to IC. Paul Johnson\nRCSC VP\nProtecting Your Property Lost Property\nEvery year hundreds of items of personal property are found and handed in at the Security Office \u2014 many such items are never claimed by the losers and eventually are returned to the finders. Students and staff who lose property should promptly in form the security staff and in many cases the items will be speedily restored. Persons finding items of personal property should hand them into the Security Officer or to one of the messengers or security guards on any of the buildings. Thefts\nIt is an unfortunate fact of life that, on an open campus such as this where a very large number of people are allowed considerable freedom of access, periodical spates of stealing occur. A good deal of this is due to the incursions of' walkin' thieves who prey on institutions such as this and on museums, several of which are in close proximity to the College. Both students and staff are requested to cooperate with the security staff by promptly reporting to the Security Officer any suspicious persons seen loitering in' College buildings, or entering offices or laboratories with no apparent authority. Wallets, cash, cheque books, calculators, slide rules and watches are the things most commonly stolen and they should never be left in jackets or briefcases in unattended rooms, in particular, cheque books and cheque cards should always be carried separately on the person as instances have occurred where heavy withdrawals of cash from banks have been made through thieves having obtained po session of both card and cheque book. Cycles\nPedal cycles are currently very attractive to\nthieves and if broughton to campus they should be secured to the cycle rack with a heavy chain and stout padlock. Plastic covered cables of the kind purchased in cycle shops are of little deterrent to thieves and should not be used. If you value your cycle please in sure it. Car Parking\nUnless you have been authorised to park your caron the campus do not bring it into the College CarPark otherwise you will inconvenience some person who has an authorised parking place. Derelict vehicles are also from time to time an em baras s ment to the College and a vehicle which ceases to be roadworthy should be disposed of by the owner and not left on the carpark where it may quickly be cannibal is ed by persons who are quick to recognise that it has been abandoned. Motorcycles brought into the College must be registered with the Security Officer and students are requested to park only in the authorised parking spaces. Parking in between motor vehicles can result in damage to both cars and motorcycles. GRR Reeves\nCHIEF SECURITY OFFICER Page 6 FEUX, September 29, 1980\n\n"

The positions of Ele c Eng De pRep and ManS ciDe pRep have also to be filled. The papers for these\nposts will be placed on noticeboards in the respective departments for ten College days, and if necessary, a paper ballot will beheld in the departments.

Liz\nHaldane Library - factor fiction? Are you looking for a cook book to vary your flat dweller's standard menus? Or the car manual you need to help you get\nrid of that noise in the engine? Off to foreign parts, perhaps, and in need of amap or a travel guide? Do you want the\nlatest Stanley Gibbons catalogue? Or just a novel to relieve the tedium of commuting? Perhaps you have a small ad you want displayed( free of charge)? A concert\nfor which you want a cheap ticket? Or do you just want some background music to\nsoothe you through the latest\nessay or project?\nThen come to the Haldane Library \u2014 we can supply all these needs and very many more. It's next to the Great Hall and is\nopen from Monday to Friday from9:30 am to5:30 pm. It is\nreally three libraries in one: the library containing all the set texts\nlor courses in the Department of Humanities( including material on short loan periods, so that it\ncan be used by as many people as\npossible); a very good music library, with classical and pop records and tapes, scores and books; and it is also( and has been since1923) the Student Union Library, partly funded by the Union and with four Student Union representatives on its Library Committee. The Library is the College's general cultural library. We don't deal here in scientific books, except for the more popular type, but we do have books on history, politics, philosophy, English and foreign literature, music, travel, biography and other subjects. There is a good stock of fiction of all types, particularly science fiction. The Library has two special collections: the Corin Collection( a small collection of20 th Century private press books) and the H.G. Wells Collection. The Music Library can oblige with recordings of pop music, folk, jazz, and big bands, film music, shows, stage plays, opera, oratorio, choral music, symphonies, chamber music, instrumental music and solo song. It has a number of standard musical scores\nand a good collection of books on music and on hi fi. We can also arrange classical music concert bookings for students at advantageous rates through' Youth and Music\", the Music Librarian deals with bookings and has details of concert programmes. We have a good range of journals and periodicals, including The Times, The Guardian, and The\nFinancial Times. Regular subscriptions include Time Out, Radio\nTimes, The Listener, Times literary,\neducational and higher educational\nsupplements, Punch, Private Eye,\nAmateur Photographer, Motional\nGeographic, Gay News, Great Outdoors,\nPractical Electronics, Popular Hi-fi,\nand Which as well as academic journals such as Foreign Affairs\nand the Journal of Contempory\nHistory. We also provide shelf room and reading space for newspapers and other journals bought by various national groups in College \u2014 the College Hellenic Turkish and Chinese Societies are among a number of groups providing daily newspapers and other publications. The Library exists for the benefit of the whole College. Come and find out what we can oiler. If you need any help finding\nbooks, records, maps or any other information, then come and ask us. The Librarian, Richard Williams, and the Music Librarian, Miss V Cedric, will gladly help, as will any of the Library staff.\nTell us. too, of books and records which you think the Library should get. Remember too, that up to a third of our stock maybe out on loan \u2014 we can reserve books and records for you and let you know when they are available. The Library maybe small, but it'swell stocked: come and find\nout what we have to offer.\nRichard G Williams\nJCR chairs\nreupholstered!\nThe J CR furniture, which has been falling to pieces for the last\nthree years, is now on the road to recovery. The operation, which should be completed by mid October involves reupholstering the chairs and covering them in brown, cream and orange fabric, as opposed to vinyl. In addition, all of the coffee\ntables are being re topped. Rae S nee(D P) emphasises that although the J CR is in College, it is a UNION room and all damage has to be paid for by the Union. Cleaners Axed!\nDUE TO further cuts in College expenditure, the number of cleaners in student halls of residence has been reduced. The Southside cleaners will now clean sixteen rooms instead of twelve, and rooms will be cleaned thoroughly only once a fortnight. The bins will still be emptied and the hand basins washed everyday. Sheets will be provided once a week for the residents to change them selves. The cuts have been achieved without anyone being made redundant; no new permanent staff have been taken on since January, so that the number of cleaners has dropped through people leaving. The remaining extra cleaners have moved from Southside to the new L instead extension. FEUX, September 29, 1980 Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "By B.B. Wolffe\nHi, I'm BB Wolffe and I'm in charge of\nexposes, scandals, caustic comments\nand wry wit. Mr Marshall has allowed\nme to cast my evil eye over College and\nthe Union and to pick faults. I am very\ngrateful for the opportunity. I must\nemphasise that Fishy Tales is not\na gossip column - I don't like any of this\nbitchy rubbish about various Union\nofficers shagging in Chem Eng toilets.\nFishy Tales is simply a cynic's view of\neveryday College life. If YOU have any\nideas for future articles then by all\nmeans write to me - of course, you\nwon't be credited.\nIF THE person next to you in the lecture\ntheatre smells a little bad, it is a good bet\nthat he is a New Linstead resident. Students\nin this hall are unable to take showers\nbecause they have only one temperature\nsetting \u2014 extremely hot (although if you wait\nlong enough you may get 'blistering').\nAs if this wasn't bad enough, there are no\nshower curtains meaning that your clothes\nand/or towel on the hook on the back of the\ndoor are going to get pretty wet. And, wait\nfor it, the showers have been specifically\ndesigned to leak onto the hall carpet!\nOn my way out I espied a sign on the\nbathroom requesting that shower attachments\nbe not used in the bath (why not use the\nshower? Hee! Heel).\nLater on, I found out that the bathrooms\nhad not been under sealed and the overflow\npipes overflow onto the floor. As I write this\nvery word, I am reliably informed by the\nperson reading over my shoulder that new\nLinstead has had numerous floods over the\nsummer.\nIT SEEMS that Mr Roger Stotesbury (current\nR CSU Bookshop Rep and last year's ICU\nHon Sec) is a marked man in the IC Union\nOffice. Liz Ljndsay expressed her desire \"to\nstrangle the wee little bugger\" when she\ndiscovered that the hall accommodation for\nthe INCOST (5th International Conference\nfor Students Of Technology) had been\n'double booked' by Mr Stotesbury. Liz has\nspent a considerable amount of time\nattempting to find accommodation for the\nconference delegates that College were\nunable to offer rooms. As it turns out, places\nhad been booked by Mr Stotesbury for two\nconferences of similar sounding names but\nwhich were, in fact, the same conference.\nHence Liz wasted a lot of her time as there\nis plenty of College accommodation for the\ndelegates and College is faced with the\nproblem of filling the rooms now empty.\nA further Stotesbury atrocity has come to\nlight! During the occupation of the Senior\nDining Room last October a large number of\nletters (approximately 150) were written by\nthe occupants to their MPs and the press\nand radio in the hope of public ising the\noccupation. However, they seemed to have\nlittle effect; this is now easily understood as\nLiz Lindsay found the letters tucked away at\nthe back of the filing cabinet in the Union\nOffice.\nIs THIS what UGAs are awarded for?\nLADIES rugby is not dead. Following\nnumerous reports in the national press last\nterm, Weekend magazine has just got round\nto it (3\u20149 September). Under the title\n' SCRUMPTIOUS' we were treated to a picture of some of the girls 'relaxing with a pint' in the Union Bar and another of Mary\nHarrington's bum in the scrum.\n\\li imSA C buu dd THE SUMMER Accommodation Centre\ndoes it again! For the second year running,\nSAC have not charged a key deposit for\nGarden Hall keys issued to student cleaners.\nLast year, a number of keys went missing\nduring the summer (not to mention the\nSouthside, Linstead and Weeks MASTER\nkey which turned up after a little internal\nbickering when it was discovered an SAC employee had procured it for his/her own\nuse of the Hall launder et tes). This year, a similar number have gone miss ng. Mr Turk\n(Warden of Garden Hall) is very concerned\nthat most rooms have an average 27 people\naccess and is demanding that a deposit be\ncharged next year.\nVeem w tite dw ik WE AT FELIX are fed up with pissing on our\nshoes. The Union bog lights have now been\nout of action for over a month. Rachel Jane\nSnee (ICU Deputy President) should pull her\nfinger out pretty soon or that poor old tree\nin the Quad is going to die of alcoholic\npoisoning.\ntj elf ow puke\nSO MUCH for the new grey carpets\n('costing hundreds') in the Maths Building.\nWhen will College realise that carpets were\nnot designed for the average IC student?\nThe toilet in Maths seems to do good\ntrade as the carpet has been almost worn\ndown to the tiles in that area. And how\nfoolish to put the carpet near the coffee\nmachine (have you been able to remove a cup without spilling at least a third of its\ncontents on the floor?).\nBest of all was the tech nicol our yawn\ndeposited not so long ago \u2014 the cleaners\nwere talking about that one for weeks.\nA trip to the Union Lower Lounge will\nshow what IC students think of carpets. This\ncarpet was put down only last term and now\nit is in a disgusting state \u2014 I have heard\nrumours that human excreta has been\ntrodden into it!\nFinally, how silly to put carpets on the\nstairs of Bernard Sunley House; what was\nwrong with the good old lino that had coped\nremarkably well when one considers the\ndevi an cie s peculiar to BSH.\nAll hope is not lost, however; the\nchemistry department has recently come up\nwith what they believe is the answer to the\nstudents' mistreatment of carpets \u2014 they\nhave hung theirs on the wall!\nT ke>i ci5e toUt AUTHORITATIVE sources indicate that the\nmuch vaunted cook-freeze system is not\nworking in College as intended. It appears\nthat frozen food from the Sherfield kitchens\nis being kept in a normal ref re iger at or in\nSouthside for a number of weeks before\nbeing served up in the refectory there. After\nthis period of time it is long thawed out and\ngetting rotten (see 'Mouldy Chickens' story\nin the last issue).\nAccording to the cook-freeze system, the\nfood should be heated from frozen just\nbefore serving. The message is simple \u2014\ndon't eat in Southside unless you don't mind\nrisking food poisoning!\nVwhoM\nSAD NEWS for all Lower Lounge pinball\ndevotees: the pinball machines were removed\nafter one was completely wrecked by\nperson(s) unknown on 23rd August. There\nhas not been a pinball machine in the\nLounge since then and it is uncertain\nwhether we are going to see one in the near\nfuture (although Rachel Jane promises that\nnew machines will appear by the start of\nterm).\nTODAY The Oily Dowson Memorial Prize\nfor Misleading Headlines was awarded to\nMr SJ Marshall. Mr Marshall rose to fame\nlast month with Alf Coleman's Vasectomy.\nANNIE'S resonant, nay divinely graceful\nvoice has been heard booming out across\nthe Union premises over the t annoy lately\nrequesting that snooker players bring back\ntheir balls. Indeed, it is easy to forget time\nwhile engrossed in a game, but could it be\nthat people do not return their balls on time\nbecause the Union takes their watches as a deposit for them?\nLAST TERM, some 75 trolleys were returned\nto Waitrose in Gloucester Road after a visit\nto IC by the assistant manager.\nRecently, a friend of ours, went down to\nWaitrose to ask if he could borrow a trolley\nto move his luggage into his new room. The\nmanager ess told him that they had only 28\ntrolleys left and muttered something about all\nthose IC students taking them. Nevertheless,\nshe could see that our friend was a trustworthy sort, and after all, he die! have\nthe decency to ask; so she took him into the\nback room and gave him a Safeway trolley!\nPage 14 FELIX, September 29, 1980\n\n"

Welcome to the College- and the Union \u2014 I hope you have a goodtime. I have been in office since Ist\nJuly and look over a lew' ongoing situations' from my predecessor Chris Pox. Since then other items of great interest arose.\nSecurity\nThe security thing seems to be\nsolving itself. Rachel and myself met Mr Reeves( the new security boss) about the proposals on security and we were quite satisfied.\nCollege have agreed to retain two security guards on Be it, and. Southside will have a roving patrol system. Appeals\nI have been involved with several Appeals lor students who have been asked to withdraw. This situation normally arises due to exam failures but can also occur during term time. If anyone is asked to withdraw, the Union is more than willing to help.

Students should book through the Student Union. The latest time for booking is 12:00 noon on the\nFriday preceding the dinner. Charges\nThe cost of a Hall Dinner during the Autumn Term will be \u00a3 6 . 0 0 per head for stall and \u00a3 4 . 5 0 per head lor students, except lor the Christmas Hall Dinner \u2014 at which pie dinner sherry is included in the cost \u2014\nwhen the cost will be \u00a3 6 . 5 0 and \u00a3 5 . 0 0 per head respectively. Payment for dinners booked must be made at the time of booking but, as bookings are accepted subject to the availability of places, deposits\nwill be refunded if a dinner is over subscribed at the time of booking. It\nis regretted that no refunds can be made in respect of cancellations by individuals alter midday on the Monday preceding the dinner. General\nStall and students attending Hall Dinners should forgather in the Senior Common Room or the AnteRoom in the S her field Building \u2014\ndepending on whether the dinner is being held in the Staff or Main Dining Hall \u2014 at 7 : 0 0 pm tor dinner at 7 : 3 0 pm.( The location of each dinner \u2014 which will depend on the number of people attending \u2014 will be displayed on noticeboards on the Level1 and Level2 Lift Concourses of the .Sherfield Building). Sherry or other drinks will be available for purchase in the Senior Common Room or AnteRoom before dinner. The wine and port served during dinner will be included in the overall charge. Dress\nExcept lor the Christmas Hall Dinner, when evening dress ( black tie)\nshould be worn, the correct dress for men for Hall Dinners is a lounge suit.\nThis is the third year that we have run the scheme and it has been very successful in the past. With the\nmoney raised, WIS find a Third World student and send him to IC to\ndo an MSc. This year I would like to\nexpand the scheme to more than one student but only if you give the\nmoney* Nursery\nEarly in July I was approached by the RCA Students Union who said that their Nursery was in difficulties because they only had two applicants next year. They were quite willing to let us have the other eight to ten places for\none year. Alter much investigation and bureaucracy I got a ii st of stall and students who might be\ninterested but the response was negligible. I cannot really believe it since our nursery has awaiting list of about l br tv people( and that is in July not October!). So in the end the plan was shelved until a later date( sometime never?). Therefore if anyone is\ninterested i.e. has babies and no nursery please contact me. Accommodation\nAt the time of writing the situation seems rather sad. The Crash Pad has been open since 1st September and although the response is low at present I expect by term time that it will be much larger. As for\noffers of accommodation coming in, I wish there were some. To Finish\nWell, it'sv our Union, we get paid to work for you. If there is\nanything you want, please get in touch and with a bit of luck I'll escape a few times and actually sec you all.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nPolice\nignore IC\nafter trophies\nstolen\nON THE22 nd August, FELIX reported that \u00a3 5 0 0 0 worth of trophies had been stolen from\nthe IC Union Office. The trophies have not yet been recovered and the police seem\nto have made little progress.\nThe theft took place in the\nearly morning of Tuesday 29th July between two o 'clock, when\nBeit security made their patrol\nand the time the cleaners opened\nthe office. A window was broken\nin the Honorary Secretary's Office\nto gain entry and then the rather\ninadequate trophy cabinet lock\nwas snapped off.\nAn unfortunate aspect of the\nrobbery is that it should never\nhave occurred. Malcolm Brain,\nwhile he was Deputy President,\nwrote to the Estates section of\nCollege on 31st October and 3rd December,1979, asking for an estimate for an alarm system and\nbetter locks for the Union Office.\nRachel Snee (present DP) received\nthe reply on 9th July 1980, just\nthree weeks before the trophies\nwere stolen.\nEven though the trophies are\ninsured for \u00a3 5 , 0 0 0 , and are of\ndoubtless historical value, the\nworth of them when melted down\nis negligible, as most of the cups\nwere only silver-plated or pewter.\nThree solid silver cups were left\nbehind! These factors have led\nCollege Security to believe that\nthe robbery was the result of a 'grudge' against the Union, by,\nperhaps an ex-student who knew\nthe layout of the Union Office.\nThey have even gone so far as to\nput forward a suspect to the\npolice: an ex-student who has\nbeen convicted of theft and vandalism in the College several\ntimes in the past.\nContinued on p3 ENTS GIG VETOED\nTHE New Musik concert arranged by IC Entertainments Committee for November23 has had to be cancelled because\nCollege Block have withdrawn\nthe use of the Great Hall. New Musik, despite a successful\nalbum and several popular singles,\nagreed at the end of August to\nplay a gig at IC for half their\nnormal fee, provided the booking\nwas for a Sunday. ENTS agreed\nand arranged a provisional booking\nof the Great Hall. On attempting\nto confirm the booking, they were\ntold that Captain Lindley, the\nCollege Domestic Secretary, had vetoed the decision.\nCaptain Lindley, when asked,\nstated that the gig could not go\nahead as it was on a Sunday. This\nmeant, he said, that there would\nwould be problems over security,\ncomplaints from local residents\nabout drunken rowdies on a Sunday night, a lot of people\nwould have to give up free time\nto supervise the concert, and if\nthe Great Hall were to be required\non Monday morning the cleaners\nwouldn't come in to set up for it.\nMike Firms ton. the ENTS Chairman, brought up the following salient points:\ni) \"Security are prepared to\ndo Sunday concerts provided they\nare not punk bands\".\nii) \" Most people come to the\ngigs by tube to South Kensington,\nand then over the walkway, which effects few residents; furthermore no drunk will be\nallowed in the Great Hall and the\nUnion Bar is the nearest source of\nalcohol( a quarter of a mile away)\".\niii) \" There is no difference\nbetween giving up time to supervise\na concert on a Sunday, and giving up time to supervise a concert on a Saturday\".\nvi) \" ENTS ii as to clear up alter a concert, in fact, alter last\nyear's John Miles concert. Mi Thomas, the Domestic Manager\nwrote to ENTS to congratulate\nthem on their tidiness. In any case, no one had booked the\nGreat Hall lor Mon dav morning.\nApparently Captain Lindley was very worried about Great Hall concerts after all the correspondence about a Jack The Lad gig some years ago, though since\nthen several Sunday concerts have\ngone off without a hitch; further-more, ENTS booking for Caravan\non Sunday 16th November will\ntake place (College claim that this\nwas passed 'by mistake'). ENTS need Sunday concerts as this is a useful way of booking bands at\ncheaper rates, and also tends to\ndraw a larger audience.\nFortunately for ENTS, they\nhave not been asked to pay a cancellation fee, but it is another\nunfortunate set back for them. \" A similar situation occurred in 1977\nwhen ENTS had to cancel Great\nHall gigs due to the GLC enforcing\nextra safety arrangements. That\ndispute was best summed up by\nthe then ENTS Chairman, Tim Fowler's, comment: \" We seem to\nbe the only venue of under 2,000\ncapacity where the GLC is exerting\nits pressure. Travel to the Round house, the Marquee, the Nashville,\nor any similarly sized concert hall,\nand look to see if they have got a four foot barrier in front of the\nstage. And few of the other regulations come near to being\nsatisfied at these examples\".\nThis autumn's situation is best\nsummed up by Mike Firmston's opinion ol College block's attitude.\n\" There are no Sunday concerts,\nbecause there are no Sunday concerts\".\nBloody great holes\nin the skirting board!\nNo. 560 Monday.

    "content": "REVIEWS Records\nClues Robert Palmer Island ILPS 9595\nROBERT PALMER, whilst always producing\ngood and sometimes original material has\nnever really become very popular in this\ncountry. This album will do little to change\nthat. Palmer has found a new toy \u2014\nelectronics. He has also found a new friend.\nGary Num an wrote two of the tracks and\nappears on one.\nThe album starts with 'Looking For Clues',\nan upbeat tune that combines Palmer's voice\nwith some fairly funky electronic backing.\n' Sulky Girl' follows which drops the electronics to produce a run of the mill Robert Palmer rock and roll song. We are\nthen treated to the rose among the thorns:\n'Johnny and Mary'. An excellent track by\nanyone's standards, and also a good single.\nAfter that the album is basically not worth\nlistening to, apart from perhaps ' Woke Up Laughing' on side two. Not even Gary Num an can save it. The tracks he wrote are\nprobably the most boring.\nRobert Palmer with this album has tried to\nkeep up with the times, but apart from the\none track, 'Johnny and Mary', which is a classic, he has failed.\nDrama Yes Atlantic K50736\nIN THE past Yes have had the knack of\nproducing albums which sounded almost exactly like all of their predecessors, but still\nselling millions of them. That was the Yes\nwith Jon Anderson as lead vocalist, and for\nthe most part with Rick Wake manon keyboards. However, Yes have changed and\nperhaps the new group should really be\ncalled Yuggles. Geoff Downes and Trevor\nHorn, the masterminds behind Buggies, stepped in to replace Messrs Wake man and\nAnderson and most, including myself, were\nexpecting a new sounding Yes. To our surprise and perhaps disappointment, Yes\nsound the same today as they ever did.\nThe album Drama consists of a mere six\ntracks, and even then one of them is less\nthan three minutes long. The opening track,\n'Machine Messiah', reminds me a lot of some\nparts of Floyd's Wish You Were Here. 'Does\nIt Really Happen' is the other major track on\nside one. It's a typical fast moving Yes track,\nwhich has some nice touches on keyboards\nwhich possibly are the best Wake man impersonations I have heard.\nThe album has several good and several\nbad points. The production is excellent and\nthe music is generally quite accessible. However the lyrics are still very bland and\ndespite a considerable effort, Trevor Horn's vocals are not quite of the same calibre of\nAnderson. The album cover, itself a work of\nart, is taken yet again from a Roger Dean painting. All in all the package looks like\nanother Yes album. Mess rs Downes and Horn have been integrated totally and Yes\nhave produced an album that will please\nmany aYes fan.\nOne Trick Pony - Paul Simon\nWarner Bros \u2014 K56846\nIT HAS been five years since Paul Simon\nreleased his last original album, Still Crazy\nAfter All These Years, and it was with\ninterest I listened to this, his first album on\nWarner Bros. The songs were written in 1978/9\nfor a film ' One Trick Pony', which stars Paul\nSimon. In the five years since his last release,\nSimon's musical style has barely changed.\nFilms\nWhat the Swedish Butler Saw\n(Cineccnta)\nTHE PUBLICITY claims that this is the first\n3 - D porno film ever made, and to my knowledge, which, in these matters, is not\nextensive, it is.\nAt \u00a33.20 a go, including the disposable (not\nto be used twice, etc. . . ) 3-D glasses, the\nfilm is hardly recommend able. To be blunt, the film is not only un erotic, but the director, it seems, almost totally\nforgot he was filming in three dimensions. In\nfact, save sixty seconds of dreaming by 'our\nhero' when naked ladies were seen swimming\nout of the screen, with arms and legs flailing,\non a black background, my expectations of\nthe use of three dimensional photography to\ncomplement the standard 'sex' movie went\nsadly unfulfilled.\nSet in an Edwardian climate, the film\noutlines the progress to sexual competence\nand fulfilment of ' our hero'. The sexual competence bit is attained in Diana Dor s' brothel( yes I'm sorry!), though he finds\nthere is still something missing, 'a thing called\nlove'. The answer to this, apparently, is to\nforcibly rape, using all the electrical mod-cons at your disposal, the first demure and\nrespectable young lady you meet. In this case,\nthe demure and respectable young lady is\nsome girl he meets in the National Gallery,\nand all the electrical mod cons at his disposal, is a room, unfortunately named the\n'snugger y', with such devices as a Chinese\ntickle r(a hand-wound device with a feather\non the end which could be directed anywhere.....), the world's first, though I'm sure there\nare many now, electrically operated pulsating\nflour e scent dildo and a very devious examination couch. Needless to say, together with too much ill-conceived comedy,\nOne Trick Pony is a very mellow album, that\nwill probably go down best late at night.\nIf you like the Paul Simon laid back style,\nthen this is an album for you. These songs\nget better the more you hear them However, if you are a newcomer to Paul.\nSimon's solo work then I would not recommend\nit as it is too laid back and it lacks immediacy.\nDave Fuller\nRecords courtesy of IC Radio.\nhe has his wicked way with her only to find\nthat she's the sexual athlete, not him.\nThe Swedish Butler comes straight from\nthe Muppet Show and his main role, other\nthan keeping what's her-name's chaperone\nbusy in the kitchen( watch for the awful\nvegetable insinuations), is to add the word\nSwedish and all it's connotations to the title.\nOh yes, there's the ghost (?) of Jack the\nRipper who goes around almost stabbing everyone in the back.\nAnd now the glowing report\nFINALLY I made it, my ambition to mix my first\n3-D movie with my weekly porno film, and I was not disappointed.\nAt30p, the snug fitting glasses were a good bargain, and we were allowed to keep\nthem and though we were informed that\nthey were not sunglasses, 1 am sure I can put\nthem to good use.\nThe director not only used the three\ndimensional effects beautifully, but continued\nto use his delicious models in a way that was\nboth subtle and erotic.\nIt was good to see Diana Dor s, still looking as\nravishing as ever, playing the part of the\nbrothel 'madame' and treating 'our hero' and\nus to all sorts of exciting positions from the\nKama Sutra.\nThe main plot, however, revolved around\nthe stud trying to seduce a stunning beautiful\nvirginal maiden he met, quite by chance, in\nthe National Gallery.\nAfter considerable effort involving numerous electric devices, serving only to\nwhet our appetite, we were treated to her\nmarvellous body, as she stood strapped to\nthe wall!\nThough I could write on for hours, I think I should leave it to you to experience this\ndelightful adventure.\nSimon Middelboe\nThe Discreet Charm\nof the Bourgeoisie\nShowing at the Minema, Knightsbridge, until\nOctober 15th, this film is an excellent example\nof the work of the French director Luis Bunuel.\nBrilliantly funny, the film offers a satirical,\nslightly surrealistic view of the lives of a select\ngroup of rich friends, plotting their course from\ndinner party to dinner party through such\nincidents as their arrest for drug smuggling and\nthe invasion of their house by the army on\nmanoeuvres. The film is funny, intriguing, and\nsuperb entertainment, and is highly recommended by the editor and reviews staff.\nDave Jago\nFEUX, September 29, 1980 Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "\"Hello, good evening, and \"\nI suppose I'd better extend a warm welcome\nto all you fresher s or I 'll loose my street\ncredibility right from day one. (That was it,\nincidentally)\nYou're now reading FELIX, one of the best\nstudent newspapers in the country. I was\nelected last year, along with Liz, Rae, and\nJohn, to edit it for this session. Unlike some\ncollege papers, FELIX is not constitutionally\nbound to tow the party line. FELIX can\ncriticize as well as praise Union policy. The\nidea of press freedom is actively encouraged\nby both the College and the Union, although\nin individual cases, some people have wished\nthat they could restrain FELIX to some\nextent. The FELIX motto sums it all up:\n'Keep The Cat Free'.\nThis year's ICU Handbook\nI would like to congratulate Dave Crabbe on\nproducing undoubtedly the best Union Handbook that ICU has seen. His coverage\nof clubs and freshly written pub guide articles, etc, has taken away the usual task\nof the FELIX Editor of re-doing them for\nFreshers' FELIX.\nMost (but not all) of the clubs featured are\nthe ones who couldn't be bothered to submit\nan article for the Handbook. After spending\nmany, many hours pasting all this up I can\nonly express my admiration for Dave Crabbe\nfor sticking to it for 72 pages and my contempt for these clubs. In retrospect, I should have chucked all of their offerings in\nthe bin. I hope next year's FELIX Editor will\nheed my words and blacklist clubs not\nbothering to submit to the Handbook.\nThe Anti-Aparteid Bit\nIt is a pity that Dave should have marred\nhis Handbook by including the article entitled\n\"The Don't Bank with Barclays bit\" on p69. This is nothing but an unfair attack on\nBarclays Bank. While most people disagree\nwith apartheid, I feel that at a time when\nbanks are competing for customers by\nplacing advertisements which help, in turn,\nto fund the production of the Handbook, it is\ncertainly not right to attack one particular\nbank in such a way.\nBarclays has been attacked by extreme\nfactions in many colleges throughout the\ncountry, but it may interest you to know that\nthey still retain a higher proportion of\nstudent accounts than any other bank.\nIt is illogical to single out Barclays, for\nwhile it is certainly true that they do fund\nprojects in South Africa, ALL of the other\nmajor banks hold accounts with Barclays\nInternational.\nTo end my outburst on this topic, I would\nlike to stab a few IC Anti-apartheid Group\nfreaks in the back: You might be interested\nto learn that Mr Derryck Everett, a former\nDeputy President, and chief exponent of the\n'Let's stop the Boat Club going to South\nAfrica' bandwagon does indeed bank with\nBarclays. When I questioned him about his\nhypocritical view on life he confessed that he\nwas 'somewhat embarrassed' by it but had\nformed his strong anti-apart eid views after\nhe had got a bank account. It was too much\ntrouble for him to change now, yet standing\nup at UG M's and s lagging off the Boat Club\n(very eloquently, I might add) seems little\neffort.\nAnd what about Aftab Gujral? He figures\nprominently in the Anti-Aparteid Group and\nbanks with Barclays. However, he seems to\nhave his head screwed on the right way as\nwhile condemning apart eid, he realises that\nit doesn't matter which bank you have your\naccount with as they've all got South African\nconnections. If they can't even agree amongst themselves why should we be\nsubjected to their ramblings with the possible\nrisk of loosing valuable advertising revenue\nfor Union publications. I will not accept these\nsmear campaigns in FELIX.\nAnti-apartheid Group at IC has done more\nfor the cause of anti-anti-apartheid than its\nintended aim. A pity.\nPeople who got on my tits this week\nYou may see a copy of the Liberal Club\nnewspaper Forward around College today.\nIts headlines are constructed with let ra set stolen from the FELIX Office after these\nLiberal bum-boys were adamantly told that\nthey couldn't use it.\nI shall be sending them an extortionate bill\nfor materials and if they don't pay it, I shan't bother too much about including any of their\narticles in FELIX. People to whom I am indebted this week\nMany thanks to Dave Jago, Mark Smith, Eric\nJarvis, Pinball, Simon Mid del boe, Simon Turner, Dave Britt on, Colin Palmer, Tim Hillyer, Mark Kuse, Nigel Masters, Barney\nMcCabe,Barry Austin, and B. B.,D.G., Ian\nand Maz The Editor\nSecurity overtime ban\nCollege security guards and messengers have\nimplemented an overtime ban due to the\nbreakdown in talks with College over revised\nrates of pay.\nOver the past month, the number of\nmessengers and security guards have been\nreduced; the complaint is that College are\ntrying to impose new manning levels on them\nwithout settling pay first.\nThe last N UP E Union meeting was on\nWednesday, 24th April. This was a result of\nthe messengers and guards calling off a previous overtime ban due to start on 22nd September after College promised further\ntalks.\nHowever, Mr Davidson, the personnel\nsecretary, failed to turn up for this meeting\nand the Union executives were merely presented with a list of manning levels to be\nworked with the reduced staff. It was then\ndecided to impose the overtime ban.\nConfusion was caused in College departments as the N UP E circular read: \" A work\nto rule by all messengers will start at 7am on\nSaturday,27 th September,1980. Until further notice\". In actual fact, a work to rule\nwas voted down in favour of the overtime\nban. In the Beit/Union building this means\nthat there will be no messenger from 7am to\n9am, with erratic manning at weekends.\nJohn Retires\nJohn McHale, the much liked Beit Hall\nmessenger, has retired to his garden in\nK il burn. John, who was at IC for seven\nyears, was made a life member of IC Union\nand presented with a cheque by the Irish\nPresident, John Passmore. FELIX, with which John has always had close ties,\npresented him with an engraved FELIX plaque.\nWe all wish John along and happy retirement\nWhile you are reading this, another FELIX\nis being produced.\nWhy aren't you helping?\nContrary to popular belief, FELIX does not appear by magic. People are\nneeded to work on FELIX.\nWe can offer you:\nAll night orgies (collating)\nFun with glue and paper (paste-up)\n20 nude persons in your room(photos)\netc\netc\nFEUX can be fun!\nDesign a space filler to fill this space\nCASH PRIZES!!!!!\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB.(5895111 ext. 1048/int. 2881) Copyright FELIX 1980.

    "content": "Continued from front page\nMicromouse\nThe European Micro Mouse finals were held in Theatre A in Maths on Wednesday 17th September. This event, sponsored by Hawker Siddeley, is a competition to find the quickest maze-solving robot.\nThe competition consisted of two parts: fastest run; and virtuoso\nperformance (judged by the audience).\nThe mice were very ingenious;\none had sonar and another had\n'crab-like' diagonal and forward\nmotion. However, both of these\nfailed to complete the maze, the\nlatter contestant complaining that\nhis mouse needed a precisely built maze. The winner (Stirling\nMouse) and only one to complete\nthe maze was a kitchen sink\nvariety using brass levers to direct\nitself along the maze. The owner\nwill receive 81,000.\nFred( complete with flashing\nred eyes) and Midnight Sun, a mouse built by Finnish students,\ntied for the virtuoso performance.\nFred gave a song and dance routine while Midnight Sun wrote\nhis name. It is interesting to note\nthat when Fred failed to complete\nthe maze earlier, his owners complained that he had been overworked by Blue Peter. Yet the\nonly mouse featured on Blue Peter\non Thursday was Midnight Sun.\nMost of the mice did not have\nmouse like exteriors and it is\nperhaps a pity that this element\nwas not considered lor a special\nprize. We feel the Am comical would surely have won.\nHome Office\naid student refugees\nFOLLOWING many years of\ncampaigning by refugee agencies,\nthe Department of Education has\nruled that refugees living in Britain will be entitled to the\nsame student award benefits as\nhome students, rather than having\nto pay the full overseas students\nfees. Many points are left unclear\nby the decision, such as whether\nthe research councils will follow\nsuit with postgraduate grants; and\na number of refugees are not\neligible under the new rating( those, for example, who have\napplied for asylum and are waiting for a Home Office decision;\nthis can take up to two years).\nHowever, the decision is to be\nwelcomed as being a major breakthrough. Whether the LEAs will act quickly enough to enable\nrefugees to take up places this\nyear remains to be seen.\nInland Revenue\nscrew up Sabbaticals\nTHE UNION has been informed\nby the Inland Revenue that Union Sabbaticals should pay tax on\ntheir grants. They claim that\nsabbaticals are 'employed' and as\nsuch are taxable under Schedule\nE( section181, Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970).\nThe matter is to be raised by\nJohn Passmore at Council, which\nhas already agreed, in principle,\nto make up the Sabbaticals' grant\nto its former level in the event of\nsuch a situation occur ing. Phil the Greek\nslags off vets at IC\nTHE DUKE of Edinburgh visited\nthe College on 4th September to\nspeak to the British Equine Veterinary Association ( BEV A) which was holding its conference\nin the Sherfield Building.\nTwo days earlier, Princess Anne\nhad spoken to the vets, but the\nDuke's opposition to the proposed\nban on the use of painkillers on\nhorses during competition provoked controversy.\nThe International Equestrian\nFederation plans to ban all pain killing drugs this year as\ndosages have been abused in the\npast to keep the horse going right\nto the end of a three-day event\nwhen it should really have been\nwithdrawn due to exhaustion.\nThe Duke is against abuse of the\ndrugs, but is strongly in favour of\nthem being used under controlled\nconditions. The Duke said that if\nuse of drugs was outlawed, some\nriders might still stretch an exhausted horse out to three days,\nbut without what is presently regarded as 'a properly prescribed\ndose' of painkiller for fear of disqualification.\nContinued from front page\nPolice\nignore IC\nafter trophies\nstolen\nHowever, the police at Gerald\nRoad Police Station seem content\nto totally ignore IC and appear to\nhave disregarded College security's suggestion. The police officer who\nis in charge of the case said that\nhe would be back for 'further\ninvestigations' a little later, but\nhas not been seen by the Union since 29th July.\nJohn Passmore ( ICU President)\nhas just been given permission by\nthe police to appeal for information\nconcerning the whereabouts of the\ntrophies. College security believe it is\nfutile as the cups are so identifiable as\nbelonging to IC that no one would\nrisk attempting to sell them \u2014 and\nmolten pewter doesn't have a very\nhigh market price. They believe the\ncups are probably at the bottom of\nthe Thames by now.\nIf, however, you do have any\ninformation, you should contact Mr Burroughs in the College Security\nOffice (int 2741). If you wish to see\nthe complete list of trophies stolen\nyou should contact the FELIX or\nUnion Office.\nBill gets his gong\nMR BILL WEST, a College maintenance operative, was recently decorated by the Polish\nGovernment in Exile for his \"outstanding action\" during the\nlast war. Mr West who is the\nPearly King of Kensington and\nChelsea, was reluctant to tell us\nwhat action merits the 'Cross of\nFreedom and Independence, with\nswords' but did sav that his son is\nPearlv King of Milton Kevnes.\nWell' done Bill!\nSafety Council\nCAPTAIN Lindley has recently\nbeen appointed Chairman of the\nCollege Safety Council. He replaces\nDr DH Napier of Che mEng who has left to go to the University\nof Toronto.\nMiserable failures\nGLI I LDS is faced with an uneasy\nstart to the year as their President,\nMr Pat Leggett, has failed his\nmetallurgy exams.\nThe Guilds HJ T. Frank Rowsell,\nhas also failed.\nRCS and Mines survived the\nexaminers axe but ICU is without\nan External Affairs Officer as Mr Chris Webb failed his Che mEng course.\nWe at FELIX suffered the tragic loss of one our most enthusiastic photographers, Mr Mickie\nMarsh, who is currently making\nyogurt and preserving fruit back\nhome. Mickie, who spent his entire\nexam period photographing the\nIranian Embassy Siege, intends to\nretake his exams next year.\nAnnouncements\nMR MOONEY is pleased to\nannounce that his breakfasts will\nstill be available this term.\nHe wishes it to be known that\nthe set menu of: Cereal/Fruit\njuice; Egg, Bacon/ Sausage; Toast and Marmalade, and, wait\nfor it \u2014 UNLIMITED tea and\ncoffee (take your thermos flasks\n- Ed) will be available for as\nlittle as 98 hard-earned pennies.\nMr Mooney would further wish\nit to be known that you can buy\na book of ten tickets for \u00a38.50\n(tickets available from the Union\nOffice, Southside Shop or\nMooney's Office).\nNATIONAL Westminster Bank\nLtd are pleased to announce that\nafter a delay which was unfortunately out of their control a SERVICE TILL is now operative\non Level 2 in the S her field Building for the use of customers\nof all branches of Nat West.\nThey would be grateful if users\nwould note that should a card in\nany way be damaged or creased\nit could render the machine\ninoperative thereby causing\ninconvenience to others.\nAPPLICATIONS for the post of\nSub-Warden of Bernard Sunley\nHouse (40-44 Evelyn Gardens)\nare invited from single postgraduate students. The successful applicant will probably have\nat least two years to complete at\nIC. The post involves helping\nthe Warden with discipline and\ngeneral organisation in the\nHouse.\nThe House contains 108 male\nresidents.\nRent-free accommodation will\nbe provided.\nApplications should be made\nin writing to the Warden, Mr\nLuiz Terxeira via the Residence\nOffice by 6th October 1980.\nFEUX, September 29, 1980 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS& SOCIETIES Opsoc smash box office records in Budleigh Salterton\nThe invasion starts quietly; the first three car loads arrive in\nthe early evening. The advance party splits up into two\ngroups, one to prepare for the arrival of the others the next\nday, the rest ( the author's party ) to check that the banner is\ncorrectly positioned above the High Street. This being done\nthey quickly retire to The Feathers for a well earned pint.\nThe Operatic Society Tour of Budleigh Salterton begins.\nThe following things start in earnest with the arrival of the scenery in a furniture van. Those unfortunate to have arrived first,\nhelp unload \u2014 those with more Tour experience arrive just in time to see the empty van departing. By the evening the full complement has arrived; all the\ncast and orchestra are drinking in The Feathers; the stage crew begin work. Then follows three days of intensive rehearsing, the\ncast in the morning and the evening, the orchestra in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the locals are striking back; they are not buying the tickets. Perhaps The Mikado is\nnot popular around Exmouth; the\nTreasurer moves around in a constant fit of depression. But by the\nfirst night all is well. With a new blaze of publicity in the form of T shirts and little green posters,\nthe populace are flocking in their thousands to buy the tickets; rumours start of black market ticket\nprices. After the first night is over the\nTour social life really gets going. On the Thursday a select group are invited into the home of a local Colonel. The g in flows freely\nand some singing occurs; on the\nway home we get fifteen people in a Citroen2 CV. After the show on Friday night, a large scale visit to\nthe Exmouth Chinese and seafood\nrestaurants is organised. The middle weekend brings fresh reinforcements from London for the charity concert. Mysterious figures entombed in sleeping bags appear at night in space previously occupied by suitcases. The charity concert on the Sunday is successful\nin raising money for the church organ fund. Afterwards, half the\nSociety take their parents for a cream tea, the other half go with their friends; this causes traffic jams at A La Ronde and Newton Pop ple ford. The second week begins with a day of f,i.e. no show in the evening. Traditionally it is the wettest day of Tour; this year is\nno exception. Undaunted by the\nrain, the company splits up and goes out for the day. The largest\nparties go to Lynmouth and pony trekking on Dart moo or. The minibus returns from Dartmoor with wheel arches intact! The rest of the week passes quickly; the barn dance, the concert party, the py jama party, the tennis competition, the barbecue, the beautiful bums competition, and many other social events are suddenly over. On the last night, another Tour tradition strikes. Pitti Sing gets\nlaryngitis and can' tsing, but such is\nthe competence of the Op soc chorus that this causes no problems( well done, Liz). After ten Performances and one concert we realise that Tour is really over \u2014\nall that remains to do is to clean out the school and goto The Feathers for a last pasty before\nleaving for London. As the last\nOp soc car load leaves for London peace descends on Bud leigh Salter ton until next time. Alan Crewe\nWhile we\nhave your attention\nDO YOU enjoy listening to/ singing light opera? If so, Imperial College Operatic Society, alias OP SOCo rICOS is\na society you should join. We have three main productions, in February( this year it's Rudd i gore) in March( still to be decided) and in July we goon Tour to Devon. This year, as well as the annual carol singing trip, we intend to\ngive a Christmas concert. We perform mainly works by Gilbert and Sullivan although we have experimented with works by John Blow and Offenbach, and we always singin English. You don't have to be a singer to join us, as stage crew, front of house staff and volunteers to help with costumes are always welcome. If\nafter reading this article you are still interested, come and see us at\nthe Fresher s' Fair, at the Music Fair, or catch us at rehearsal in the\nMusic Room of53 Prince's Gate( opposite Me chEng) on Tuesday evenings, failing that contact me via the Union Office or the Mines letter racks.
