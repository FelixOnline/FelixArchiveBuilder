Unless you\u2019re a Millwall fan, in\nwhich case it\u2019s brick in hand. Whether we are building\nthem up, or tearing them down, the simple wall plays\na part in every significant moment of human history.\nThe first ever wall is a point of contention among the\nwall-istorian community: a sea wall somewhere? Well,\nit occurs to me that the A and B walls probably came\nfirst. The Great Wall of China? But surely the first-ever wall would\u2019ve been \u2018pretty good\u2019 at best. Most\nscholars have settled on the answer that the pearly\ngates must be embedded in some kind of wall, and to\navoid a twenty minute conversation with a member of\nChristian Soc, it\u2019s worth conceding that was the first.\nToo many people view walls as a way to keep people\nout. Let me tell you: they do just as good a job of keeping\npeople in. Was Hadrian\u2019s wall built to keep the Scottish\nout? Obviously it was, and that is a noble goal. But even\nmore importantly, it stopped good, god-fearing English\npeople from accidentally crossing from the land of milk\nand honey over to the land of youth unemployment and\nday-drinking.\nThe award for most misunderstood wall-o-phile of\nmodern times has to go to Donald Trump, a lifetime\nmember of the W.A.P. (Wall Appreciation Party), who\nwanted nothing more than a \u2018physical, tall, powerful,\nbeautiful\u2019 wall. I have it on good authority that the\nlocation was a secondary consideration. Another wall\nlover demonised by the pro-fence media is the late,\ngreat Mr. Gorbachev, who had absolutely no desire\nto tear down that wall. Once again the minds of our\nchildren are poisoned by anti-wall lobbyists working\nfrom their Whitehall offices. It\u2019s worth noting this\narea of London was originally called Hite-Wall before\nBig Fence became the political powerhouse it is today.\nBut this article is not a call to arms. Instead, it is\nsimply a celebration of an unsung hero of our time.\nA life without walls is no life at all, or certainly a\ndraughtier one. Let us hope that all our beautiful walls\nreally do get ten feet higher someday soon. And that\u2019s\nthe way it is. A celebration of Wall-purgis Night\n\n"

    "content": "Art is never finished, only abandoned. Words allegedly spoken by Leonardo Da Vinci; a man known\nfor, ironically, never finishing most of his paintings.\nHowever, unlike Leonardo, we here in the Arts section\nare once again taking up pen, brush, microphone, and\ncamera to bring art back to you after our brief absence.\nArt is one of the driving forces that keeps our souls\nalive; where would we be without it? Human existence\nhas forever taken delight in art, even before civilisation\nbegan: paintings were made detailing heroic exploits\nand honouring natural wonders, stories of legend were\ndramatised by wise men and women over hearths to\nadoring crowds, and music was played, conjuring up\nvivid images of the world around us.\nWhat art does is tell us all a story; it does not just\nrecount bare facts and detail, but instead embellishes\neach story with personal touches that can only come\nfrom the creative mind. An artist can look at a landscape with their eyes, but what they then paint will not\njust be a literal photographic interpretation but a mixture of reality, emotion, and thought. And this applies\nnot just to art but to music and literature as well.\nWe may know our favourite plays and operas word\nfor word and song for song, but we will always see them\nperformed in new lights, for each actor and singer\nbrings their own input and distinctive traits to the art,\nwhich brings it off the page and into our eyes and ears.\nSometimes this is done to great eff ct and truly moves\nus as human beings, but other times, these qualities\nobfuscate and drown out the original art rather than\nexpanding it. However, like the art itself, which has the\ntruly personal embedded in its essence, the recipient\n(that is you, dear reader) will also have personal appreciation for such things; what is good art to our eyes and\nears is not necessarily good art for everyone since we\nare \u2018oh so opinionated\u2019.\nWith this in mind, I have a task for each and every\none of you. Theworld has been blessed with art. However, not all of us know about it or care for it\u2026 yet. If\nyou see a piece of art, go to a play, or attend a concert,\nwhy not tell us about it? Tell us how it made you feel.\nArt has ways of moving us all, in both good and not\nso good ways. Tell us what you think the artist wants\nus to feel. Many artists are good at conveying their\nown emotions and experiences to you. However, some\nartists may fall short of this objective and won\u2019t portray their meanings to you eff ctively, and it\u2019s up to you\nto tell us how well this is done. Where can I find art?\nArt is found in the places you\u2019d expect: galleries, concert halls, theatres, etc., but oftentimes the best art is in\nthe hardest-to-find places and is left obscure. Why not\ntell us about them and inform others on how to access\nunderappreciated art forms more easily.\nThe job I have for you is simple: inform us, educate\nus, and give us reason to see things for ourselves. We are\nall opinionated about art; even those of you out there\nwho say you don\u2019t care for it, tell us, why!? Some of us\nare new to the art world, and that\u2019s a-okay; we aren\u2019t\nborn knowing art intrinsically \u2014 we have to learn at\nsome point \u2014 so if you ever find yourself with spare\ntime, why not pop into a gallery, see a play you know\nnothing about, listen to a musical you\u2019ve never heard\nof before, and tell us about it afterwards. Remember as\nwell, every opinion and nugget of information, no matter how concise and brief, is valuable to someone. Join\nthe Arts team at Felix! Inform, educate, and reason\u2026\nFRIDAY 10TH FEBRUARY 2023\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n24\nEdited by: Gilbert Jackson\nSophie Pointon\nArts EARTHQUAKES IN LONDON: AN INSIDER\u2019S REVIEW\nTHE ARTS SECTIONS IS BACK!\nARTS\nIT\u2019S TIME TO PLAY THE MUSIC, IT\u2019S TIME TO\nLIGHT THE LIGHTS!\nFelixArtsisbackagain!\nGilbert Jackson Arts Editor\nWhat\u2019s On...?\nDid you know...?\nThe Royal Opera House, The English\nNational Opera, and The Barbican let you\ncreate student accounts, which allows you to\nbuy heavily subsidised tickets!\nHowever, only certain performances for\neach opera will have student rates.

Already nominated for three Oscars in\nBest Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing, with a\nPalme d\u2019Or already in its trophy cabinet, I\u2019m a bit late\nto the party, but is the all this hype deserved? Triangle\nof Sadness is a three-part act that charts the journey of\ncouple Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean) and Carl (Harris\nDickinson), who are invited on an all-expenses paid-for luxury cruise, and its guests, before pretty much\neverything that could go wrong on a ship does, leaving\nthem stranded on an island.\nWe jump in,\nm o c kum enta r y\nstyle, examining\nthe absurdity of the\nmale-modelling industry and Carl\u2019s shaky\nposition within it. At an\naudition, the judges recommend he work on his \u2018triangle of\nsadness\u2019 (the area between the eyebrows and the forehead), mirroring\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s own exploration of the holy\ntrinity of power: money, class, and beau-ty. Dean plays Carl\u2019s supermodel girlfriend\nwith balance, adeptly toeing the line between\ninnocence and manipulation. Ther fraught relationship dynamic hinges on Carl\u2019s fragile mascu-linity, exacerbated by his inability to ful\ufb01l traditional\ngender roles. In a painful spat over money, he \ufb02ips out\nat having to pay the bill, whilst Yaya points out that her\njob as a model has landed them their hotel room. Her\ninvestment in the relationship is just a stepping stone\nto her ultimate goal of being a \u2018trophy wife\u2019, a role only\navailable in a patriarchal framework.\nIt becomes clear that everything that makes a luxury\ncruise so covetable \u2014 seclusion in the middle of the\nocean, limited resources, and being o\ufb00 the grid \u2014 is\nexactly their downfall when marooned on a beautiful\nisland. No one knows this as well as Abigail (Dolly de\nLeon), the head of toilet sta\ufb00. Self-important head of\nsta\ufb00, Paula, played by Vicki Berlin, continues pandering to her rich guests, never truly breaking free of the\nbehaviour which has rewarded her in the past, struggling against the incoming tide of a matriarchy. Carl\u2019s\nillusions of love for Yaya are swept aside as their roles\n\ufb02ip. Without money, beauty is an even stronger cur-rency, one that now only Carl can exploit, raising the\nquestion perhaps of whether any society can be free of\ncapitalism, in any particular shape or form. His charade of loyalty reveals him as a pathetic social climb-er, adapting to whatever hierarchy he faces. Dickinson\nbrilliantly captures the snivelling energy of Carl, whose\npretty face barely masks the insecurity fuelling his\nevery decision. Fans of Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s other darkly\ncomedic work will be pleased by his continued work\non the uncomfortable dialogues between pairs of\ncharacters. Theimmersive shots paired with a\nsoundtrack, drawing from classical to techno music, slot you right in with a heavy\ndose of second-hand embarrassment. In\nForce Majeure, the marriage between the\nmain characters is tested when the\nhusband decides to\nabandon both his wife and\nchildren when an avalanche\nhits.Atitscore,Tri- angle of Sadness is also\na story of (main- ly) a couple\u2019s trials\nand tribulations \u2014 exploring when\npersonal survival trumps commitment to a rela- tionship. Yaya implores Carl to \u201cnot do anything you\nwouldn\u2019t want me to do\u201d, a slippery slope\nonly made steeper by the stakes at play. Each\ncharacter is complex and well flesh d out \u2014\ntheir personalities evolving as they face fresh adversity.\nMost comical is perhaps Zlatko Buri\u0107\u2019s self-proclaimed\nRussian \u2018king of shit\u2019, Dimitry: a blubbering, sweating\ncaricature of capitalism. Most of his scenes have genuinely laugh-out-loud moments, notably his (slightly\ntoo pointed) argument with socialist captain, played\nby Woody Harrelson. Dolly De Leon\u2019s stellar performance has the audience in a chokehold, savouring\nh e r punishment of those who have belittled her, and demands a watch in\nitself.\nHowever fun it is to see\nthe elite make a fool of\nthemselves, it does feel a\nlittle hard to swallow given\nthat success in the \ufb01lm industry\nhas and will continue to\nentwine the personal lives\nof both director and cast\ndeeper and deeper into the\nupper class. Having done the\nrounds at various glitzy \ufb01lm festivals it\u2019s hard to understand exactly who this movie was made for; us to\nlaugh at the rich or the rich to laugh at\nthemselves? But then again, if for a pay-checkabunchofactorswillpretendtohave\nexplosive diarrhoea, I guess the movie\u2019s message and reality blur slightly.\nTh re are strong parallels with Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Galapagos, where an assortment of survivors of\na cruise shipwreck establish a new world order and of\ncourse, mirroring the descent into barbarism and rivalry in William Golding\u2019s Lord of the Flies. Triangle of\nSadness throws up its own questions, tailored to mod-ernsociety,wheretheattainmentofmoney,power,and\nstatus are no longer as linear; Instagram in\ufb02uencers\nand tech wunderkinds are just as likely to end up on\nthe same table as trust-fund millionaires. Although the\n\ufb01lm started production way back in 2019, the sharp\nrevelation of Priti Patel\u2019s so-called \u2018low-skilled employees\u2019 as key workers during the COVID pandemic adds\nyet another dimension to this tale of riches-to-rags.\nTheparting request for the audience is simple: examine\nyour own moral corruption.\nSorcha Owens discusses the morals of Ruben \u00d6stlund\u2019s newest comedy of excess.\nFilm Review\nSorcha Owens Film Writer\nFILM & TV\n\n"

    "content": "Political-romance novels don\u2019t exactly have a genre\nof their own, but it seems to me the two themes\nhave more in common than meets the eye. Nick\nHornby\u2019s newest title Just Like You, and Fran Cooper\u2019s\ndebut novel These Dividing Walls, both zoom in on\nromance in the context of political upheaval.\nJust Like You is the story of a regular meet-cute\nwhich blossoms into a full-blown romance. Joseph\nis a young, black man who works in a north London\nbutcher\u2019s shop frequented by Lucy, a middle-aged,\ndivorced, white mother of two. The pair strike up an\nunexpected friendship through Joseph\u2019s babysitting\nof Lucy\u2019s boys, but their obvious diff rences on the\nsurface make their relationship rocky. Place them in\nthe political landscape of 2016\u2019s Brexit referendum and\nanother layer of tension is added to the situation.\nIn this novel, Lucy is strongly against Brexit, whilst\nJoseph takes an agnostic stance, choosing to avoid\nantagonising his pro-Brexit parents, and feeling he\ndoesn\u2019t know enough about politics to comment.\nThis refl cts the views of many younger people, especially now that information is\nso often misleading and easily\nmisconstrued. But Joseph\u2019s\nuncertainty rubs off on Lucy,\nwho steps back and analyses\nher own opinions, and it is this\ndynamic, where each person\nchallenges the other\u2019s judgement,\nthat makes their relationship \u2014\nand relationships in general \u2014 so\ncompelling and meaningful.\nThese Dividing Walls follows\nthe lives of the residents of a\nParisian apartment complex\n\u2014 Number 37 \u2014 during a\nsweltering French summer.\nAmong these residents is\nvisitor Edward, who is staying in\nhis friend Emilie\u2019s attic fl t, and\ndealing with the recent death of\nhis sister. Edward takes a job in\nEmilie\u2019s aunt Frederique\u2019s bookshop, who also resides\nin No. 37 and has also previously suff red a loss. The\ntwo find comfort in each other\u2019s company, whiling\ntime away with sightseeing and thoughts spoken aloud.\nTher shared feelings lead to something more potent;\nan intimate companionship. This happens against a\nbackdrop of civil unrest, with some local Parisians\nacting on their heated opinions about immigrants\nmaking the city their home. This also divides the\nresidents of No. 37, especially fuelled by the arrival of a\nMuslim family.\nContrary to the characters in Just Like You, Edward\nand Frederique largely remain separated from the\npolitics in their building, but the contrast between\ntheir shared internal struggles and the fraught tension\nof their surroundings makes their own affair, and the\ncountry\u2019s, all the more poignant.\nFunnily enough, both novels explore a relationship\nbetweenayoungmanandanolderwoman,albeitinvery\ndiff rent ways. This may explain why political discus-sioncomesintoplay,asgenerationalgapscanemphasise\ndiff rences in political opinion. This could appear in\nthe form of how much a character actually cares about\npolitics, pressure or influences\nfrom family and friends, and as\nsimilarities or diff rences in point\nof view.\nPolitics can act as a\nmuch-needed grounding force\nin otherwise whimsical romance\nnovels and make the reader feel\nmore involved. Reading Just Like\nYou while living in post-Brexit\nLondon, and These Dividing Walls\nwhileonholidayinParis,Ifeltthis\nparticularly keenly.

A good example is Godspeed You!\nBlack Emperor and Lift Your Skinny Fists, which is\na mainstay in all alternative vinyl-hoarders\u2019 collec-tions, while other albums in their discography like\nF#A#\u221e don\u2019t receive quite as much attention. People like Spiderland by Slint, but even I haven\u2019t actually listened to Tweez all the way through.\nEven my beloved Mancunians Elbow have\nit rough: under 2% of their total listeners\nhave even listened to their newest album!\nThe same unfortunate thing has happened to Phil Elverum\u2019s band The Microphones, a precursor to his musical re-brand-ing as Mount Eerie (not to be confused with\nthe subject of this review, The icrophones\nalbum Mount Eerie). The album that gets\nthe most attention from Elverum\u2019s Microphones days is The Glow Pt. 2. According\nto last.fm, only 11% of listeners of the band\nhave even bothered to listen to Mount Eerie. The album followed The Glow by two\nyears, and was (at least until 2020) the last\nfrom Elverum under this moniker; this is\nthe work that led him to \u2018bury\u2019 TheMicrophones and transition to the new musical\nand artistic direction he wanted to follow.\nA meditation on the struggle to stay alive\nand confronting your eventual death, the\nalbum takes the sonic identity of The Microphones to its inevitable conclusion.\nThe album starts out with the same\n\u2018foghorn\u2019 sound that made many appearances on Th\nGlow, and almost indistinguishably \u2018I want wind to\nblow\u2019, the first track from the previous album, plays\nunder the noise and ominous foghorn. Things aren\u2019t\nas they seem though, as the lively, folksy guitar is soon\nswallowed up by nothingness as we\u2019re introduced to\na thumping rhythm formed by the sudden stops and\nstarts of various drum samples. Thefirst half of \u2018I. The\nSun\u2019 is a long, primal \u2018drum solo\u2019 to get lost in \u2014 representing the first years of life, living in the fast lane.\nIt comes to a crashing stop as Elverum waves goodbye to family, friends and loved ones as they sail away\nfrom him. \u201cSee me wave my handkerchief on the\nshore.\u201d Singing to the sun, the universal observer on\nthis planet, he\u2019s almost asking for a guardian as he faces his loneliness. After mourning the loss of all those\nhe knew, he\u2019s scared away by a \u201cblack ship\u201d on the ho-rizon, and frantically begins to climb Mount Eerie.\nThesong ends in a crescendo of cacophony and disso-nance, eventually just all-encompassing white noise.\nThe album continues as a narrative from Elverum\u2019s\nperspective in this hostile world, having clambered\nthe first bit of the mountain, watching the sun set. A\nmore palatable listening experience returns in \u2018II. Solar System\u2019 accompanying the narrator, Phil, waiting\nfor an inevitable end in peace. \u201cLet the fl sh-fl od\nbegin, wash me down the canyon, quicksand pull me\nin.\u201d Themantra Phil repeats, \u201cI know you\u2019re out there,\u201d\ncontinues as he walks through the trees. He\u2019s looking at death and the souls of the dead surrounding\nhim on the mountain, the symbol of the struggle to\nstay alive. \u201cYou\u2019re vultures in trees, you\u2019re lanterns on\nlakes.\u201d Phil eventually ascends the mountain further,\nin \u2018III. Universe\u2019, after the guitar of the previous song\nis again drowned out in noise and discomfort. As he\nclimbs, the universe asks him: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nAnd in response, he continues to climb and climb,\nfruitlessly trying to escape the end that approaches\nhim; in the end it\u2019s what\u2019s above him that will be his\ndeath. \u201cHow many times have I died up here before?\u201d\nHe asks to the void, as there\u2019s no sun for him to question anymore. A dissonant choir of voices, the universe\nor perhaps those who died here before, surround him.\nPhil finds himself on a boulder eventually as his\ndeath approaches. \u2018IV. Mount Eerie\u2019 describes his death,\nas a Big Black Cloud envelops his senses. It\u2019s tranquil\nand calm but solemn until the sudden moment Death\nhimself appears, and takes joy in breathing in Phil\u2019s\nlast breath, taking his life as a \u201cbloating bully\u201d. He\u2019s\nsurrounded by a gang, jeering and leering at the dying\nman, taunting him in his last moments, both vocally\nand in the instrumentation. A heavily distorted, droning guitar and clipping drums accompany Death\u2019s cruel\nsong, until this fades, the Big Black Cloud departs and\nobserves Phil\u2019s body being consumed by vul-tures, observing morbidly \u201cTheway they share\n/ Thememory you did wear / and now your\nsong / is inside of them.\u201d The way the band\nplays with the textures and timbres of the\nvoices and instruments on this album is one\nof the best things about it; not only do various diff rent characters show up vocally, but\ninstruments and distortion plays a large role\nin itself. Once again at the end of the track,\nthe universe lifts Phil\u2019s spirit up into the void\nof white noise, the earthly realm behind him,\nand in \u2018V. Universe\u2019 he sees himself refl cted\nin the universe itself. Silence shocks the listener before Phil is joined by the universe as\na choir behind him. It ends in this strange\nand unearthly kind of euphoria \u2014 a pessimistic listener might think that this might have\nbeen more of this blind hope (\u201cI know you\u2019re\nout there\u201d) hinted at in the second track.\nThough based heavily around various meta-phors, the album doesn\u2019t really try to hide its\nsubject matter. It\u2019s quite explicit and obvious\nwith a lyric sheet open in front of you, but\nthat doesn\u2019t take away from the experience\nand meditation on the nature of mortality and death.\nMount Eerie really a class act of musical storytelling,\nand I do wish more artists had the gall to come up with\nconcept albums like this. More than that, though, I\nwish more people would dig a little deeper into artists they think they\u2019ve listened to and find gems like\nthese. If you\u2019ve listened to The Glow Pt. 2 and not this\none, I recommend checking it out. I guess this ends my\nsemi-essayonthisalbum.Ishouldprobablywriteabout\nLaughing Stock by Talk Talk now just to complete my\nset of favourite narrative albums about death, shit.\nBen\u2019s warm grails: Mount Eerie\nSometimes the concept album can be taken too far in the best kind of way.\nBenjamin Bateman Music Writer\nAlbum Reviews\nMUSIC\n\n"

This year\u2019s Regionals\ntournament, hosted by Imperial on\nJanuary 28th, saw twelve teams from\na total of eight diff rent universities\ncompete in the City & Guilds building.\nThe winning Imperial team\nconsisted of undergraduates Adam\nJones (computing) and Justin Lee\n(chemistry), as well as PhD students\nMichael Mays (aeronautics) and Enoch\nYuen (molecular biosciences). Th y\nbested tournament favourites Oxford\nA in their sixth match, who finished\nthe day with eight wins and two losses,\nmeaning that a final was not needed to\ndetermine the winner. This is the first\ntime ever that a non-Oxbridge team\nhas come first at ACF Regionals in the\nUK, since it was first hosted in 2016.\nImperial is now looking likely to be\nrepresented in the notoriously diffi lt\nACF Nationals tournament for the\nsecond year running. Justin Lee, also\nChair of the Quiz Society, remarked on\ntheteam\u2019srecentsuccessintournaments:\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad we\u2019ve won a second\ntournament in 14 days - there were\na couple of close games, but we made\nit unbeaten without having to play\nan additional final.

At its latest\ncomplete actuarial valuation in March\n2020, the value of the scheme\u2019s assets\nwas found to fall \u00a314.1 billion short\nof the scheme\u2019s technical provisions.\nAs a result, a deficit recovery plan\nwas put into place which obligated\nemployers to pay a contribution of\n6.2% of salaries to the fund. This will\nincrease to 6.3% as of April 2024.\nDespite the gravity of the deficit on\npaper, acting Chief Financial Offi r Dr\nTony Lawrence assured the community\nthat in 2021-2022 \u201c\u2018Imperial delivered a\nsoundfinancialperformance\u201d\u2019.Lawrence\nowed his optimism to the fact that\nemployer contributions are to be repaid\noveranagreedrecoveryperiodof18years.\nHowever, he also warned that\n\u201c\u2018this is likely to remain a source\nof volatility in our results in the\ncoming years\u201d\u2019, especially as another\nvaluation of USS is due in March.\nThe USS deficit recovery plan is\na point of contention, as academics\nand academic-related staff continue\nto strike in protest against reforms\nto their pensions. Proposed reforms\nwould see many individual\u2019s pensions\ncut and employee contributions\nhiked, which strikers argue eff ctively\nequates to a drop in their salaries.\nPrior to February\u2019s industrial action,\na spokesperson for Universities UK,\non behalf of USS employers, said:\n\u201cThe reality is that for some\nconsiderable time, universities have\nhad to do more with less and make up\nthe shortfall on the cost of teaching\nand support from elsewhere in budgets\nbecause fees have not kept pace\nwith infl tion. This is the context in\nwhich we would ask members of the\nUCU to consider whether to join\nthe picket lines in the weeks ahead.\u201d\nLawrence agrees, writing in the report\n\u201cThe cost of delivering a high-quality\nlearning experience is increasing at a\ntime when home undergraduate tuition\nfees are capped until at least 2024\u201325.\u201d\nFigures from\nImperial\u2019s Annual\nReport show that\nincome from\ntuition fees and\nteaching contracts\ncontinue to provide\nan increasing\np r o p o r t i o n\nof Imperial\u2019s\ntotal income.\nT h i s\nunsurprisingly mirrors the increasing\nannual intake of students.

This is not\na sustainable situation going forwards,\nparticularlyasweareplanningforfurther\nmodest growth in student numbers.\u201d\nHowever, the increasing proportion\nof College income eaten up by pension\ncontributions may indicate why staff\nnumbers have fl tlined in recent years.\nOscar O\u2019Flanagan\nImperial College Quiz Society Treasurer\nIsabella Ward Co-Editor-in-Chief\nImperial A acheive a clean sheet of ten wins in quiz competition qualifiers.\nHeightened financial pressures make College\u2019s sustainable staff strategy unclear\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 10TH FEBRUARY 2023\nSCIENCE\n11\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\njourney of Michael Hedges\nAny reduction of air\npollution exposure on the Underground\nis a huge bonus as it contains the most\npolluted sites in London. In general, underground trains in deep tunnels have\nthe worst air quality in a city because\nair is trapped and the particulate matter is constantly disturbed and created\nby trains. \u201cMetallic particles from\nthe brakes, wheels,\nrails, and\ns p a r k s\nfrom electrical contacts make\nup around\n6 7 %\nof the airborne particles.\u201d\nsays Michael. Thedeeper\nthe platform, the more diffi lt it is\nto exchange the air, and the worse the air\nquality is. London\u2019s deepest line, Victoria line, has a median PM2.5 concentration of 361 \u00b5g/m3\n\u2014 over 25 times higher than the roadside level median and\naround 24 times higher than the WHO\nguideline for 24-hour exposure.\nBut although particle concentrations\nare high, Michael stresses that the eff cts\nthese particles have on health are not\nyet known and this is preventing decisive action on tackling what is potentially a toxic environment. One part of his\nPhD is to Underground dust\u2019s oxidation\npotential, a key indicator of infla ma-tion. \u201cThis infla mation response can\nlead to many systemic issues such as\nstrokes, dementia, asthma, cancers,\nheart disease, and diabetes,\u201d he says.\nIn London, 9,400 premature deaths\nare attributed to poor air quality,\nand worldwide it is estimated that\n1 in 5 deaths is caused by air pol-lution, mainly from burning\nfossil fuels. Although the\nUnderground dust may\nbe less harmful than ex-pected, it may conversely be more harmful than\nexpected as well. Michael\ncycles much more than he\ntubes. If he takes the Tube,\nhewearsamaskand,ifpos-sible, takes the lines that\nare nearest to the surface.\nAn interactive map of the\nTube pollution levels at\neach station can be found\nvia the QR code at the end\nof this article, which might\nhelp you plan your journeys to\navoid the worst air pollution.\nAnother interesting finding\nin Michael\u2019s study was that the\nlevels of PM2.5 are the same at\nthe front of a tube carriage as at the\nback. This is likely due to the trains\nconstantly kicking up the dust, never\nallowing it to settle. He also found that\nNO2\n, a pollutant from diesel engines,\nwas present in the Underground net-work, which will have likely been drawn\nin from the car traffi above ground, albeit at lower levels. Another question is\nto disentangle the health eff cts of NO2\nand ozone above ground from fossil fuels and from the metallic particles that\nfog the Underground.\nI ask how we can reduce levels of pollution in the Underground, and Michael\nsays \u201cmore ventilation and platform\nscreen doors like those on the newly\nopened Elizabeth Line would make a\nhuge diff rence\u201d. He says that underground stations in Seoul and Paris have\nlive air pollution monitoring that is displayed to passengers. \u201cWhat would happen if London\u2019s underground network\nlooked like this?\u201d he asks.\nMichael wants more people to cycle\nand use public transport. \u201cMy favourite\nway to travel around London is by cycling\u201d he says. But the challenging experiences of cycling in London has led him\nto support safer cycling infrastructure,\nand programmes to increase confid nce\nin cycling. Even as an ex-cabbie, Michael\nsupports LTNs, increasing the ULEZ\nzone, increasing TfL\u2019s funding, and reducing the number of cars that are on\nour roads. Perhaps route-finding apps\ncould include \u2018pollution exposure\u2019 as a\nmetric to find the best routes, but maybe\nthis is a PhD for someone else...\nnd research air pollution on the Tube.\nScan to see an\ninteractive\nmap of Tube\npollution\nlevels.\nCredit: Natalie Yu\n\n"

Although a rookie on\nthe societies scene, having been founded\nby Matthias Jammot in 2022, the society\nalready has a staggering 235 members.\nYou may think that bio-engineers\nwould dominate the Prosthetics Society; however, design, mechanical, elec-trical, chemical, civil, and aerospace\nengineers are also amongst its ranks.\nAnd this is only the engineers!\nTh re are also computing students,\nmaterials scientists, mathematicians,\nand medics involved in the group.\nAny team working in the field of prosthesis is truly a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019.\nMirayKirollos,amedicintercalatingin\nmedicalengineering,toldmehow,inher\nstatic-arms team, not only does each student bring diff rent skills from their re-spectivedegrees,buttheyalsoteachthese\nskills to each other. How collaborative!\nAs a leader, Miray loves how easily\ndiff rent roles can be delegated among\nthe diverse set of engineers. Meanwhile, her continuous learning in different fields of engineering incidentally\naids her throughout her own degree.\nIn between Miray and Matthias sits a man I had heard\nlots about; Digby Chappel.\nA PhD student with prosthetic\nhands, Digby is leading a team of undergraduates to design a Myoelectric\n(electrically-powered) Arm to compete\nat the 2024 Cybathlon at ETH Z\u00fcrich\n(taking place 25th\u201327thOctober). As a\nmentor to Jared and Camille Lemoine\n(also 2ndyear bio-engineering), he involves them in the development process\nof electric upper-body prostheses and\nteaches them hands-on skills that they\nwould not get in their lectures or labs.\n\u201cHegivesusinsightintowhatisstandard\u201d, Jared said, clearly in awe. \"We don't\nchase the game. We are focused on the\ntask. Our main task is the hybrid arm.\"\nThegroup also holds incentivising so-cials: Matthias, lead of the myoelectric\nprostheticleg,organisedapubquiznight\nand two inspiring talks for the group.\nThefirstwasbyNateMacabuag,founder\nof Koalaa (an arm-prostheses start up),\nwhostressedtothegrouptheimportance\nof comfort. In the second, Alex Lewis \u2014 a quadruple amputee, fund-raiser,\nand speaker \u2014 taught them \u2018what true\nprosthesis should be\u2019, which is very different from what we may think they are.\nThe talks were eye-opening, as both\nspeakers emphasised that people with\nlimb diff rences don\u2019t want prostheses for everyday tasks, as they learn to\nadapt in creative new ways. Most don\u2019t\nuse prostheses at all, because they are\ntoo heavy, uncomfortable, cause excessive sweating, are expensive, do not last\nforever, may only be worn for specific\ntasks,andcouldbehorriblydesigned.For\nexample, Alex Lewis showed the group a\nmountain-climbing attachment made of\nrubber which would not grip onto anything slightly tilted and was, at around\n\u00a3900, not the greatest investment. However, through Lewis\u2019 collaboration with\nthe University of Southampton, the\nfirst handcycle for a quadruple amputee\nwas built; a real feat in biomechanics.\nThe speeches from Lewis and Nate,\nand the stories of their interactions with\ntheir clients led Matthias, Digby and\nMiray, and the other 200 society members to design well thought-out prostheses which will allow people to revisit\ntheir old passions or try out new ones\n(sports, arts and crafts, cooking, etc.).\nThe ambition of the Prosthetics Society must be met with enough dedication from its members. Camille and\nJared invest three hours per week into\ntheir projects and sometimes even more\nwhen they attend the open Electrical Engineering and Computer-Aided\nDesign (CAD) workshops. The society truly prioritises skill development\nthrough practice and peer-sharing.\nThe Prosthetics Society is open to\neveryone, regardless of their back-ground. If you want to help people\nwith limb diff rences, want to learn\namazing hands-on skills, and want to\n\u2018get stuff done\u2019, instead of letting projects gather dust or staying in your\nown headspace, I strongly encourage\nyou to join the Prosthetics Society.\nUntil next time,\nCharlotte\nCharlotte Probstel Societies Writer\nProsthesis (n.) vs. Prosthetic (adj.)\nWE DON\u2019T CHASE\nTHE GAME.

    "content": "The ongoing cost-of-living\ncrisis and the war in Ukraine\nhave brought the importance of\nfuel security to the forefront of the\nnational debate. It is increasingly clear\nthat countries need to be more self-suffic nt, and the UK\u2019s reliance on\nfossil fuels is a huge contributor to\nmaking the country less secure. Right\nnow, it is also making us poorer.\nThe UK still imports billions of\ndollars of oil every year to meet our\nenergy demands. According to the\nHouse of Commons community report\nfrom January of this year, fossil fuels are\nused to meet around 75% of the UK\u2019s\nenergy needs, and the past year has\nshown what a precarious position this\nputs us in. It makes us dependent on\noil and gas countries and their leaders.\nAlthough the UK should try to remain\nglobally relevant, it should also be as\nself-suffic nt as possible so the threat\nof another country turning the gas off\ndoesn\u2019t dictate our national policy.\nCountries like France, which maintains\na large nuclear component in its energy\nmix, and Norway, where almost all\nenergy comes from renewable sources,\narefaringbetterunderthecurrentglobal\ncrises than the UK, which is set to be the\nonly major economy to shrink in 2023.\nTh re are countless environmental\nreasons to move away from fossil fuels,\nbut the central one is that burning\nthem is releasing more and more CO2\ninto the atmosphere, which is warming\nour planet and acidifying our oceans,\nfuelling both the climate and ecological\ncrises. This isn\u2019t some niche opinion:\nthe International Energy Agency, an\nintergovernmental agency that works\nwith countries around the world on\nenergy policy, has said that if we want to\nlimit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, no new\noil and gas fields should be explored.\nEven without these concerns,\nthe case to transition to clean\nand renewable energy has never\nbeen stronger than it is right now.\nGreat Britain is ideally positioned\nto take full advantage of clean energy\nsources: as an island with a huge\nproportion of coastline compared to\nits area, renewables are an easy option.\nCoastal areas tend to be windier, hence\nthere is a lot of space available for\noffshore wind farms. Indeed, in recent\nyears, the UK has been breaking records\nfor electricity generation \u2014 achieving\nlonger and longer solar generation\ntimes, going the longest period without\nrunning a coal generator since the\nindustrial revolution, and recording the\ngreenestmonthforelectricitygeneration\nby reaching new lows of CO2\noutputs.\nSo what do we need to do\n?\n1. One strand of the switch to clean\nand renewable energy is the need to\ntackledemandandconsumption.Energy\nconsumption, and therefore demand, is\nstill rising, and demand drives the way\nthat electricity is produced and how\nmuch it costs. The national grid turns\non power stations to meet demand as\ndynamicallyaspossible,startingwiththe\ncheapest options. In the UK that means\nnuclear, then wind, solar and other\nrenewables, and then gas and even coal\nwhen demand spikes and renewables\naren\u2019t able to meet the requirement.\nIf we can lower and smooth demand\non the grid, we can make the most\neffic nt use of the best energy sources.\n2. We need investment in energy\nsources lower down the chain that feed\nthenationalgridtoincreasecapacity.The\ngrid can\u2019t run full-time on intermittent\nsources like wind, so constant sources,\nlikenuclear,areneededifwearegoingto\nleavefossilfuelsbehind,andsoareenergy-storage options coupled to renewable\nresources like pumped hydropower.\n3. The government needs to legislate\nfurther to disincentivise fossil-fuel use.\nThe UK has a commitment to reach\nnet zero by 2050 and zero-carbon\ngeneration by 2035 (commitments\nthat exist because all the science says\nwe must stop emitting greenhouse\ngases). Carbon pricing \u2014 a UK carbon\ntax \u2014 has shown the eff ct that real\nlegislative intervention can have: the\nscheme made coal-fired power stations\nincredibly expensive to run, pushing\ncoal generation to the very fringes of\nthe UK energy mix in just a few years.\nAll of this makes decisions like\nthat taken by the UK government to\naward new licences to expand fossil-fuel extraction absolutely baffling.\nThe need to leave fossil fuels behind\nandswitchtoclean,green,andrenewable\nenergy now is clear and science-based.\nIt is also the most economically sound\noption for the long run. Although this\nwinter everyone has been suff ring from\nthe eff cts of the cost-of-living crisis,\nexisting renewables have lessened the\nstrain. Green energy has even overtaken\ngas as the main contributor to the UK\u2019s\nelectricity generation this winter, and\nit was only possible because of our preexisting green-energy infrastructure. We\nneed more of it, and far, far less fossil-fuel dependency. We could lead in the\ntechnology and energy sectors, pushing\nthe cutting edge forward and exporting\nour lessons learnt.

Without\nsuitable guidance however, even the\nmost well-intentioned approach is\nlikely to fall foul to misunderstandings,\nassumptions, idiomatic expressions, and\ndecontextualisation, as well as na\u00efvely\nsimplistic literalism anticipating the\nspectre of legalism. Compounding\nthese, the projection of egotistical biases\nandprejudicesleadsinevitablytocherry-picking, resulting in a message that is\nincondite, confusing, and antiquated\n\u2014 hideous darkness masquerading as\nenlightenment; the prize for the unwary.\nThe genius of the Qur\u2019an partly lies\nin its ability to address people in every\nage post-revelation. To its pre-modern\nrecipients, passages like (51:47) \u201cWe\nbuilt the universe with great might,\nand We are certainly expanding it,\u201d and\n(21:30)\u201c...theheavensandtheearthwere\none mass, and We tore them apart[...],\u201d\nwere clearly inexplicable, but to people\nfamiliarwithEdwinHubble\u2019sworkthese\nnow make perfect sense.

As\nmight be expected of a scholar, there\nis the requisite literature review \u2014\nextensively referencing the ~1,000-year-old tafsir genre \u2014 complemented\nwith novel research where applicable.\nThe result is transformational.\nTake, for example, the allusion to\njudgement day in the chapter \u2018The\nMoon\u2019 (54:1) \u201cThehour has drawn near,\nthe moon has split,\u201d which precludes a\nliteralist interpretation; exemplifying\nthe Qur\u2019an\u2019s use of the past tense to\nreference the future; diff rentiating\nDivinefromhumantime.Theabsenceof\nreliable eye-witness testimony discounts\nthis assertion in the narrative literature,\nindicating folkloric embellishment of\na prophetic miracle, or the common\nand pervasive mythology that stoning\nto death is an Islamic prescription\ndespite contradicting the Qur\u2019an.\nInstead, because of the infeasibility of\nproviding four eyewitnesses (24:4), the\nentirely notional penalty for adultery\nof 100 lashes, according to the chapter\n\u2018The Light\u2019 (24:2), emphasises the\negregiousness of the sin. As Abou el\nFadl points out, however, the real focus\nhere is on deterring slander (penalised\nwith 80 lashes), the Prophet\u2019s wife\nfamously suff ring this accusation.\nLiteralistic and legalistic prescriptions\naside, recourse to a fine would likely\nconstitute a just, modern Islamic\npunishment for defamation, mirroring\nthe remedy available under English law.\nAs for the adulterers themselves, societal\napprobation and civil-law-like rather\nthan criminal (hudud) proceedings\nwould presumably suffic today.\nWhat about the notorious wife-beating verse? Chapter \u2018The Women\u2019\nrelates the tradition of husbands\naccusing their wives of sexual\nimpropriety (nushuz) \u2014 based on the\nsuspicion (real or otherwise) of their\nspouse taking a lover while he was away\non extended travel \u2014 leading to her\nindefinite incarceration in the family\nhome (or worse), thereby facilitating\nhis remarriage.

To\nadd fuel to the fire, the Department for\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs\n(DEFRA) have approved the use of\nthiamethoxam, a harmful neonicotinoid\npesticide known to particularly aff ct\nhoneybee and bumblebee populations.\nThis announcement comes after a\npotential threat posed by yellow virus,\nwhich aff cts production of sugar beet\nand is spread by aphids. Thiamethoxam\nis taken up by the plant and spreads to\nall parts of it, including the nectar and\npollen. This makes it easily accessible to\nforaging insects like honeybees, moths,\nand butterflies. The n onicotinoid\nis known to cause serious damage to\nthe nervous system of these insects,\nmaking it diffi lt for them to navigate\nand forage for food. In 2018, the EU\nbanned the use of thiamethoxam\nbecause of the damaging eff cts it has\non pollinators. But following Brexit, the\nUK government approved emergency\nuse of the pesticide to combat crop\ndisease.\nHow are insect populations faring\nin the UK and why is this a signifi ant\nannouncement?\nThe \u201cState of Nature\u201d report is one\nof the most comprehensive reviews of\nthe UK\u2019s biodiversity, published by a\npartnership of over 70 conservation\norganisations. It provides an overview\nof population numbers, distributions\nand assessments of threats facing\nwildlife. The mo t recent fi ures from\n2019 state that since the 1970s, the UK\nhas lost over 40% of its bee, butterfl ,\nand hoverfly pecies, and that many\nspecies are in danger of extinction.\nThese ignifi ant declines are attributed\nto habitat loss, climate change,\npollution, and pesticide use. The d cline\nin insect\npopulations has far-reaching\nconsequences for the UK\u2019s ecosystem.\nAs we are all aware, insects play a\ncrucial role in pollinating plants and\nproviding food for other birds, bats and\nother animals. Ther loss would mean\na domino eff ct extinction of animals\nfurther up in the food chain. But this\ndecline also has implications for food\nsecurity \u2014 many crops, such as fruit\nand vegetables, rely on pollination\nby insects. In fact, bees alone are\nresponsible for one out of every three\nspoonfuls you eat!\nThiamethoxam usage does not\njust drive the decline of already low\ninsect populations. Studies show that\nneonicotinoids also have negative\neff cts on the overall health of the\nenvironment, including impacts on\naquatic organisms, birds and other\nwildlife that depend on insects as a food\nsource.\nWhat are conservation\norganisations saying?\nUnderstandably, the news has been\nmet with anger and disappointment\nby conservation organisations and\nactivists. The same a nouncement was\nmade by DEFRA last year, leading the\nWildlife Trusts to take legal action\nagainst the UK government over its\ndecision.\nTo try and put minds at ease,\nministers have announced that they\nwill incentivise farmers to use fewer\ninsecticides. This decision comes as\npart of new post-Brexit agricultural\nsubsidies as part of the Sustainable\nFarming Incentive (SFI) announced by\nenvironment secretary Th rese Coff y\nlast Thursday. Farmers will receive\npayments for limiting their use of\nharmful chemicals and for looking after\nwildlife. But even with this scheme in\nplace last year, it has been diffi lt to\nget farmers to sign up to the scheme\n\u2013 fewer than 2,000 have joined so far\ndespite a hope of 140,000 joining.\nIs adding subsidies really going to\nstop farmers using pesticide on top of\npesticide to keep their crops safe?\nGovernment approval of bee-killing\npesticide will further drive insect decline\nenvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nAndra Vladu Environment Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14\nEdited by: Simran Patel\nMarie Mori\nEnvironmentt\nCredit: Envato Elements\nENVIRONMENT\nA compelling case against the use of environmentally-unfriendly chemicals in agriculture.\n\n"

UCU members\nnationwide are participating in\nindustrial action relating to cuts to the\nUSS pensions scheme, which covers\nUK higher education. In addition\nto this, Imperial UCU members\nare engaging in industrial action in\nresponse to the College\u2019s 2022 local pay\naward, which they feel is insuffic nt\ngiven the current cost-of-living crisis.\nImperial College Union (ICU) has\nsupported the UCU\u2019s strike action\nin various forms since 2018. In the\nmost recent strikes in November\n2022, and in January and February\n2023, space was provided in the\nUnion building for striking staff to\nmeet, hold events, and store materials.\nHowever, the support of a marking\nand assessment boycott represents\na step further in its endorsement\nof the trade union\u2019s industrial\naction, and a change from ICU\u2019s\nposition earlier this academic year.\nIn November 2022, Union Council\nvoted on a separate UCU marking and\nassessment boycott planned for January\n2023 (which was later called off). In\nthat vote, Council was noticeably more\ndivided: 41% of present members voted\nnot to support a boycott, 28% voted\nagainst the resolve, and 31% abstained.\nTheUCU\u2019s newly proposed marking\nand assessment boycott will begin from\nApril 2023, pending the outcome of a\nballot of the trade union\u2019s members to\nrenewitsmandatetocallindustrialaction.\nIn the UK, industrial action is only legal\nif a majority of a trade union\u2019s members\nagree to it in a ballot. During a marking\nand assessment boycott, UCU members\nare asked to cease all summative marking\nand associated assessment duties.\nCouncil members heard from an\nImperial UCU representative, who\nexplained why he felt industrial action\nwas necessary. He told them that the\nCollege had off red a median 3.3% pay\nincrease for the 2022/23 academic year.\nStaffearningtheverylowestsalarieswere\nawardedan8.5%increase,whilst\nthe highest earners received\na 1.1% increase. He argued\nthat, in the face of double-digit infl tion, the average staff\nmember would be hit by a real-terms pay cut of around 8%.\nThe UCU representative\ncalled upon ICU to continue\nsupportingthestrikes.Heasked\nthat students be encouraged\nto join picket lines, and that\nUCU members continue to\nbe allowed to use parts of the\nUnion building on the days of strikes.\n\u201cI completely reject this idea that\nthe College raises all the time, that\nstudents are customers, and that\nsomehow staff or students should be\nblamed for fees\u201d, he said. \u201cThe manner\nin which the College behaves is frankly\none of survival. All they\u2019re trying to do\nis bring in money and put pressure on\nstaff, when our interest is supporting\nstudents and just trying to get by.\u201d\nCouncil members discussed the\npotential impact of further industrial\naction, including the proposed marking\nand assessment boycott. Th re was a\nsense among some present that the\nboycott would spur on the College\nto negotiate further. One member\nfrom the Royal College of Science\nUnion argued that a boycott was now\nnecessary, given that past strike action\nhad been ineff ctive, saying, \u201cI think\nit\u2019s really important that we vote in\nfavour of the marking boycott \u2014 it\u2019s\nthe only real way we can eff ct change.\u201d\nAn Undergraduate Engineering\nRepresentative to Council argued\nthat disruption to students would be\nminimal, especially compared to strikes,\nwhich result in lost teaching hours.\nICU President Hayley Wong\nreiterated that the Union puts the\ninterest of students first. She also\nreassured members that, should a\nmarking and assessment boycott\nhappen, the College promises to do\neverything in its power to prevent it\nfrom having an impact on students.\nThe motion itself, authored by\nJason Zheng, ICU Deputy President\n(Education), notes that \u2018all College\nemployees deserve a fair salary and fair\npensions.\u2019 On the topic of pensions it\nsays that while \u2018the USS pension scheme\nis one of the most generous in the UK\u2019,\nits value has been eroded over time. The\nmotion observes that \u2018the UCU claims\nthat the average union member will lose\n35% of their future retirement income.\u2019\n\u201c\nContinued from page 1...\nUnion Council...\nThis year\u2019s industrial action is more intense than\nanything we\u2019ve seen before. The number of\nstrike days has increased significantly from\nprevious years, and the threat of a marking and\nassessment boycott is now upon us. We are obviously\nvery concerned about the impact that this round of\nindustrial action will have on students\u2019 education and\nstudent experience, with the equivalent of nearly four\nteaching weeks being impacted. However, we are\nalso conscious that the working conditions of staff\nare the learning conditions for students, and believe\nthat when staff feel they are fairly compensated then\nstudents will have a better experience as well.

Michael was a union representative for taxi drivers and\nhad meetings with the mayor\u2019s offic to\ndevelop ways to clean up the taxi fl et.\nTher approach at the time was to fix\nup old taxis to bring them up to at least\nthe \u2018Euro 3 standard\u2019, which calls for\nlimited CO, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. It was agreed\nthat all taxis would charge their customers 20p extra over 3 years, which\nwould pay for the upgrades. \u201cBut this\nwasn\u2019t enough, and taxis were still producing vast amounts of NOx [nitrogen\noxide] pollution,\u201d he says. \u201cGreenpeace,\nFriends of the Earth and Global Action\nPlan were all campaigning for taxis to\nbecome less polluting.\u201d. Rather than\nfi hting against the campaign groups,\nMichael and the mayor\u2019s offic worked\nwith them to find a solution. Th y listened to each other and combined their\neff rtstoaddpressureonthegovernment.\nIn 2016, air pollution in taxi cabs\nwas measured and it was found that taxi\ndrivers breathe the most polluted air out\nof any professional driver. A 40-min-ute journey from Heathrow to Bethnal\nGreen showed the highest levels on\nCromwell Road, just south of Imperial\u2019s\nSouth Kensington campus (see image\nbelow). A series of videos made by GlobalActionPlanalsoshowedthattaxidriv-ers were concerned about the air pollution they were creating and breathing in.\nTaxis suck in pollution from vehicles\nin front of them, and then hold that\npollution in the cab. Electrifying taxis would therefore reduce the nitrogen\noxide pollution that can accumulate in\nthem. Michael started a Masters in 2018\nat King\u2019s College London, with Dr Ben\nBarratt, (then at King\u2019s College and now\nat Imperial) as his personal tutor. Michael\u2019s dissertation was on improving\nair quality in taxi cabs. \u201cThemain finding was to change the ventilation mode\nto \u2018recirculation\u2019, which cuts off the air\nfrom outside and blows just the air that\nis trapped in the cabin. But this traps the\nair and carbon dioxide builds up, which\naff cts the driver\u2019s concentration and\npotentially increases accidents. I found\nthat taxis should open their windows\nbriefly at least every 20 minutes when\nthey are in the least polluted areas to\nmaintain the best air quality in the cab.\u201d\nMichael also worked with the\nMajor of London and the Union of\ntaxi drivers to electrify taxis, which\nnow populate around 50% of the fl et.\nMichael started a PhD with Dr David\nGreen at King\u2018s College in 2019. The\ninvestigation of health eff cts on the\nLondon Underground was presented\nas a topic, and Michael took it on after\ngaining an MRC Centre for Environment and Health Studentship. \"I had to\ntake a substantial cut in earnings and,\nwith my partner\u2019s support and my own\nsavings, I also needed to change my lifestyle to make taking a PhD work.\u201d\nAs COVID-19 hit, and the\ndepartment moved to Imperial\nCollege, there was much disruption to the initial stages\nof Michael\u2019s research. His\nresearch involves working\nwith 120 participants (60\npeople with lung conditions\nthat cause breathing dif-fic lties, and 60 with\nhealthy lung function),\nmeasuring their exposure to muti-pollutants\non journeys e i -t h e r\nunderground\nor over-g r o u n d .\nThe parti c i p a nt\nhealth outcomes be-fore, during,\nand after exposure to multipollut-ants are assessed to\ndetermine if there are any\nadverse health eff cts from\nunderground travel. \u201cMandates\nto wear masks on public transport were enforced, which delayed the\nstudy, but I found that mask-wearing\nreduced the exposure to pollution that\nthe participants were subjected to.\u201d he\nsays.

The worst option by\nevery metric is to travel by car: it is the\nmost polluting, exposes you to the most\nair pollution, causes the highest carbon\nemissions, is the least space effic nt,\nmost expensive, causes the most con-gestion, and causes the most fatalities.\nLet\u2019s be clear: public transport is the way\nforward.

Yet, one picket argues that, faced with an 8%\npay cut which effectively equates to losing one month\u2019s\nworth of salary every year, to him losing 18 days of pay to\nstrikes this year is a no-brainer.\nThey told me how they have especially \u201cagonised\u201d over the\ncommitment to boycott marking and assessment. However,\nthey feel that this is the best chance they have at putting\nsufficient pressure on the College to resolve the disputes,\narguing that this is better for students and staff in the long-term.\nWith 16 more days of striking ahead of them, they realise\nthat they need to strategise to ensure there are moments of\nheightened pressure on the College.\nTrade unionist Roger took to the megaphone to reiterate\nthis. He called this set of strikes \u201cunique\u201d due to the length of\ntime they span, and offered support in strategy, logistics,\nand contacts.\nThose present have resolved to be \u201cless passive\u201d on the\npicket lines and increase attempts to explain their cause to\nnon-striking colleagues and try to win them over: \u201cWe\ncannot afford ourselves to be divided\u201d, one\nmember stressed. \u201cThe longer the picket line, the shorter the\nstrike\u201d, is the mantra.\nShortly after the regrouping they headed off to an organiser\nmeeting in the Union. The use of these facilities, as well as\nthe provision of tea and coffee to the picketers, are made\npossible by the student union\u2019s continued support.\nUCU members are grateful for this, but also referenced an\nincident on Wednesday night when University of\nManchester students occupied (and are still occupying, at\nthe time of writing) three campus buildings in support of\nUCU demands and amidst a rent strike. Picketers are\nhopeful that momentum will gather behind a student support\ninitiative here at Imperial. They maintain that a better deal\nfor staff will result in a better quality of education for\nstudents, telling me as we walked to the Union building:\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a greater case for unity between staff\nand students than there is now\u201d\n\n"

But\nthe reality is unfortunately much worse.\nIn the reported study by Kumar et\nal., it is unclear if the instruments were\ncalibrated to the underground\nenvironment before measuring.\nBut calibration of the instruments\nis crucial to get accurate data.\nKumar et al. found that levels of PM2.5 (denoting particles\nsmall enough to reach the alveoli\nin the lung) at the South Kensington Piccadilly line underground\nplatform were between 40-50 \u00b5g/\nm3\n; whereas a previous study by\nSmith et. al. from King\u2019s College\n(now absorbed into Imperial\u2019s\nEnvironmental Research Group)\nused calibrated apparatus and\nfound this value to be 178 \u00b5g/\nm3 \u2014 which is 4 times greater.\nLevels of PM2.5 can be remarkably high in the London\nUnderground. This is because\nair can get trapped in the tun-nels, and dust created by brakes,\nwheels, and sparking from electrical connections is always disturbed by regular trains kicking\nit up. Thehighest value recorded\nin the Smith study was 885 \u00b5g/\nm3\n, whereas the WHO guideline\nfor 24-hour exposure is 15 \u00b5g/\nm3\n, and annual exposure just 5\n\u00b5g/m3\n. Roadside levels in London average 14 \u00b5g/m3\nof PM2.5, but are\nmore likely to have much bigger problems with other pollutants such as NO2\nand ozone. All of these pollutants cause\ninfla mation, which in turn increases\nthe risk of asthma, dementia, strokes, di-abetes, cancers, and many other diseases.\nThe UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DE-FRA) has classifi d the Tube as an \u2018indoor environment\u2019 that currently has\nno guideline limit for any air pollut-ants. With two million people using\nthe Tube every day, and people spending roughly 90% of their time indoors,\nDEFRA should focus on setting indoor\nair pollution thresholds as a priority.\nThe Clean Air (Human Rights) Bill,\ninformally known as \u2018Ella\u2019s Law\u2019 after\nElla Kissi-Debrah, a 9-year-old girl who\ndied of air pollution, has passed through\nthe House of Lords with exceptionally\nstrong cross-party support. The bill addresses indoor air, therefore including\nthe London Underground, and establishes the human right to breathe clean\nair precisely and explicitly in UK law.\nIt would require the Secretary of State\nPeter Knapp Science Writer\nEdited by: Angie Lo\nTaylor Pomfret\nScience\nHow to avoid the worst air pollution\nwhen travelling around London\nThe air pollution problem on London's Underground is worse than we thought.

With proposed\nagreements on the rise such as the new\nCoal Elimination Treaty, which hopes\nto phase out coal use and mining,\nglobally, by the 2030s, it seemed that\nthis heavily-polluting source was finally\nbeing addressed for its environmental\ndamage \u2014 being responsible for\nover 30% of the 1\u00b0C increase in\nglobal temperatures according to the\nenvironmental charity ClientEarth. The\nfutilityofgraspingontothissourcewhile\na plethora of cleaner energy sources\nare available has never been clearer.\nHowever, a planned destruction of\nL\u00fctzerath, a dainty village in western\nGermany, seems to undo all this\nprogress. Plans for a lignite (\u2018brown\ncoal\u2019) mine are going ahead, aiming\nto extract 280-million tonnes of coal\n\u2014 a reality which would entirely\nimperil the 1.5\u00b0C global warming\nlimit promised at the Paris Agreement.\nThis goes directly against the words\nof the German government, who in\nNovember last year promised their\npeople and the world that coal-based\nenergy production would be phased out\nby 2030 due to the increasing concern\naboutGermany\u2019sroleinglobalwarming.\nThe foundations of this monstrous\nmine have been laid.

But\nwhen a piece keeps much\nof its volume tucked away\n(not all, we don\u2019t want it\nto be too cagey), it can be\ncalming, soothing, intro-specting. With that, here\nare some brief recommendations for albums where\nthe instrument count\nis low and the loudness\nwar is not fought: prime\nfodder for those lonely walks home (assum-ing you own noise-can-celling headphones).\nUndercurrent(1962)\nby Bill Evans & Jim\nHall\nIn the intimacy of just\na piano and guitar, Bill\nEvans and Jim Hall, in\noneoftwocollaborations,\nshow their quiet\nvirtuosity and chemistry\nover six jazz standards.\nThe two play their roles\nimmaculately, with one\ncomping, often in a\ndeceptively simple way,\nto compensate for the\nvanished rhythm section,\nleaving just enough space\nfor the other to produce\nan airy, searching, almost\nghostly solo. Hall\u2019s warm\nguitar tone works as a\nbrilliant counterpoint to\nEvans\u2019 clear yet slightly\nmellowed grand piano.\nDiscreet Music\n(1975) by Brian Eno\nAmbient music is the\nobvious poster child for\nthis \u2018quiet music\u2019 genre\nI\u2019ve invented. Brian Eno\nkick-started the genre\nwith the famous Music\nFor Airports, but I think\n1975\u2019s Discreet Music fi s\nbetter here. Two channels\nof simple synthesiser\nmelodies, phasing in and\nout at random intervals,\nthe 30-minute piece is\nan example of generative\ncomposition. The\nfragments wander around\naimlessly, rearranging\nthemselves, reappearing\nevery once in a while\nlike some hypnagogic\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. But it would be\nrude to mention Eno\u2019s\nambient adventures\nwithout mentioning its\ngrandfather.\nErik Satie, The\nComplete Solo\nPiano Music (2003)\nby Jean-Yves\nThibaudet\nSatie\u2019s \u2018furniture\nmusic\u2019 was designed\nto be background\nmusic. Throughout this\nrecording of his entire\npiano output, you will\nfind a range of hushed\nexpanded voicings under\ninconclusive melodies,\nbutwithcommondetours\ninto waltz, ragtime,\nand pantomime. Much\nof this era\u2019s solo piano\nmusic could fit into this\ncategory; Debussy\u2019s or\nRavel\u2019s impressionistic\nventures, or Philip Glass\u2019\naptly named Solo Piano\nrecording.\nAlmost Alone (1996)\nby Chet Atkins\nAs the name suggests,\nthis is a mostly solo\nelectric guitar recording\nfrom Chet Atkins, with\noccasional vocals, string\noverdubs, and even some\ncrowd ambience in one\ntrack. Tho gh hardly\nrubato\u2019d to hell and back,\nAtkins benefi s from\nbeing the sole driver\nof the music, with full\nreign over which notes\nto let ring out and which\nsilences to hold onto.\nEuropa Endlos\n(1977) by\nKraftwerk, Franz\nSchubert\nA little change here, as\nKraftwerk\u2019s Trans Europa\nExpress is for the most\npart klings and klangs,\nharsh strings, and robotic\nGerman voices talking\nabout D\u00fcsseldorf and\nDavid Bowie. But at the\nend of the album\u2019s arc,\nthere is \u2018Franz Schubert\u2019,\nand closing with \u2018Europa\nEndlos\u2019; two tracks based\non a repeating sequenced\nsynthesiser line with\nradio-like strings fading\nin and out. In contrast\nwith the harsher tones\nof the album\u2019s suite, the\nelectronic construction\non these tracks lend\nthemselves to a warm,\norganic, and almost\nethereal feeling, as the\nvocals end the tracks,\nquietly repeating, fading\ninto silence.\nQuiet music: a\nwhisperstop tour\nof the lush Magdalena Bay production on it, with\ntheir signature dream-pop-synths (running over a\nsmooth as hell baseline) really doing it for me. I\u2019m still\nprocessing the album so I will refrain from giving any\nfurther thoughts, but you may catch me discussing\nit more extensively in a full length review soon.\nAfter ruining the field of music for a while with\nthe sped up version of \u2018Miss You\u2019, Oliver Tree decided\nto continue torturing me with a KSI collaboration\n(why did this need to happen? ). Track sucks hard,\nso annoying. I really miss the \u2018Ugly is Beautiful\u2019 era\nwhen Oliver would actually dish out high quality\nindie rock, but it really seems like his creative\noutput has very much become shitty remixes, failed\ncountry attempts, and unnecessary cross-overs.\nFinally, a shout out to Dev Lemons, whose work\nI\u2019ve been following quite closely. She very rarely\ndisappoints, with every new single showcasing lots\nof personality and attitude. Albeit the new track\n\u2018Nightstand\u2019 is not the wildest on the production front,\nit\u2019s a gentle, soothing ballad that sees Dev exploring\nher vocal range a lot more, which I think is quite cool.\nI continue praying to the gods of hip hop for\nJPEGMAFIA to drop soon (he is dropping THREE\nALBUMS this year with DANNY FUCKING\nBROWN, holy shit, I\u2019m so hyped; please, please\ngive me something soon Peggy, I am begging you).\nHopefully more exciting stuff to come in February.\nShhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhut up and listen.\nAnna K\u00fcik Music Writer\n\n"

I hate to say it, but the algorithm was successful\nyet again, and I found the adventure-action film wildly entertaining. As in any blockbuster action film, the\nmain cast is fi led with familiar faces; Mark Wahlberg\n(Ted) and Tom Holland (Spiderman) play the main\nduo, Victor Sullivan and Nate Drake, with costars Sophia Taylor Ali (Grey\u2019s Anatomy), Tati Gabrielle (You),\nand Antonio Banderas (The Mask of Zorro).\nConsidering this is your run-of-the-mill explorer\nadventure \u2014 following mysterious journals, maps and\nciphers towards an ultimate goal of \u2018buried\u2019 treasure \u2014\nWahlberg, Holland, and Ali do a great job building up\nthe complexity of their characters\u2019 relationships. Th re\nis a fair amount of backstabbing, with the \u2018every man\n[/woman] for themselves\u2019 mentality between them,\ninterspersed with lots of humour and a few heartwarming moments. Unfortunately, Ali and Gabrielle\u2019s\nroles are a little lacking in depth and fulfilm nt, but as\naction fil s go, Uncharted does alright on the female\nrepresentation front. Although the plot moves slowly\nat times, the scattered action scenes more than make\nup for it, comprising multitudes of impressive, well-choreographed stunts and rooftop chases, in the same\nleague as the Mission Impossible fil s. Holland himself\nhas claimed they were the \u201cbiggest and toughest of his\ncareer\u201d, which is saying something, coming from the\nmost recent Spiderman to grace our screens.

How this expansion comes about has no definitive\nanswers, but scientists commonly refer\nto a mysterious \u2018dark energy\u2019 as the impetus for expansion, an entity crucial\nin our understanding of the end of our\nuniverse. Whilst it may be diffi lt to\naccess a force acting on cosmological\nscales, recent studies have suggested that\nour search for dark energy may actually be closer to home than first thought.\nThe notion that our universe is\nexpanding has been around since Edwin Hubble\u2019s observations of receding\ngalaxies, but only more recently have\nwe discovered that this expansion is\nnot constant; rather, the cosmos we\nsee is accelerating away from us. These\nresults were extremely signifi ant, and\ntheir discoverers, Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt, and Adam G. Reiss, were\nawardedthe2011NobelPrizeinPhysics.\nYetthedrivingforcebehindthisacceleration remains unclear. The term dark\nenergy is often used as a placeholder for\nthisobscureforce,anenergydensityper-meating spacetime with negative pres-sure. Given that dark energy makes up\napproximately 68% of the universe, de-velopingatheorywhichencapsulatesthe\ndynamicsweseeandaccuratelydescribes\nit is cruicial for our understanding.\nFinding a theory for dark energy\nwhich is consistent and compatible\nwith pre-existing theories of the universe has proven to be challenging thus\nfar. One of the foremost explanations\nis currently known as the cosmological constant, a term originally included by Einstein in his theory of general\nrelativity (GR) to ensure that the cosmos was not expanding. Contrary to\nEinstein\u2019s intentions, the cosmological\nconstant is currently used to model the\nexpansion of the universe, describing\nan energy intrinsic to the vacuum of\nspace that reproduces the observations\nwe have of surrounding galaxies being\ndriven away from us. What was once designed as a constant to keep spacetime\nstationary has now gained status as a\npart of the \u2018standard model of cosmology\u2019, namely the \u039bCDM (Lambda cold\ndark matter) model of the Universe, and\nis among the most successful theories\nwe have in accounting for dark energy.\nDespite these successes though, there\nremains a glaring issue for the \u039bCDM\nmodel specifi ally regarding vacuum en-ergy. Dark energy is a term that encapsulates the energy responsible for accelerating the expansion of universe, whilst\nvacuum energy is a kind of energy that\npermeates the whole universe and may\nbe taken into account as a contribution\nfor the dark energy. Vacuum energy can\nbe calculated using results from quan-tumfieldtheory,yetwhenthiscomputa-tion is done, the result is a value around\n10120 times too large, an enormous discrepancy which makes it hard to argue\nin favour of both quantum field theory\nand the \u039bCDM model simultaneously.\nIt is this discrepancy that has motivated\nresearch into a diverse range of alternative hypotheses, and to explore the\nvalidity of any of these approaches requires a wealth of observational data to\ncompare against. Precision data involving forces acting on the largest scales in\nthe universe can be tricky to obtain, but\nfor one set of theories, there is mounting\nevidence to suggest that the answers may\ninstead lie in objects such as the Sun.\nExtensions of GR are a set of theories\naimed at explaining expansion, not by\nintroducing some dark energy, but by\nmodifying how gravity itself operates.\nImproving on a theory as successful and\nrobustly tested as GR is no small feat,\nbut the idea of these models is that they\nwill be able\nto reproduce\nthe same results predicted by GR at\nlocal scales,\nwhilst simul-t a n e o u s l y\nm a t c h i n g\nthe expansion seen at\ncosmological\nscales. However, modifying gravity\nmay not only\naff ct dynamics at the largest of scales,\nbut also introduce small variations in celestial objects found within our own gal-axy. For instance, theories such as general scalar-tensor extensions of GR predict\nthatthegravitationalconstantGmaynot\nbe as constant as was once assumed, and\nspecifi ally in the case of the Sun, could\nvary depending on the object\u2019s radius.\nIn a study published in Astronomy\n& Astrophysics, researchers Saltas and\nChristensen-Dalsgaard demonstrated\nthatsincetheSunisasystembasedonthe\nbalance of gravity and pressure, changes\nto the gravity acting on it should manifest themselves as measurable features in\nthe star\u2019s structure. More specifi ally, the\nauthors predict that, among other vari-ables, the speed of sound inside the Sun\nshould be aff cted. Thespeed of sound\nis a quantity which determines how vibrations travel through the solar interior in an analogous way to the propagation of earthquakes through the earth,\nand this eff ct comes about due to its\ndependence on both pressure and tem-perature, both of which will be changed\nif the force of gravity is varied. Thesesolar measurements can in turn be used to\nquantify exactly how the theory should\ndescribe modifi d gravity, adding to a\ngrowing body of work aimed at pinning\ndown these all-important parameters\nthrough observations of other celestial\nbodies, and even gravitational waves.\nMeasurements of the Sun as a test for\ndarkenergyisanexcitingavenueinprob-ing fundamental physics, but despite the\ndevelopments made in these theories,\nthe \u039bCDM model remains the predominant description due to its simplicity\nand ability to pass the majority of tests\nwe have given it so far, something that\nmany theories in modifi d gravity have\nbeen unable to match. Yet the presence\nof a huge discrepancy in vacuum energy,\nalongside a number of competing ideas\nincluding expansions of GR, represent a\nsignifi ant challenge to our understanding of how the universe should be de-scribed. It is for these reasons that there\nis increasingly a need for empirical data\nin order to ascertain the correct way for-wards. Extensions of GR may well fade\nin support in the light of new evidence,\nbut it is the observations themselves that\nare crucial in making that judgement,\nagain demonstrating this process as a\ncore tenet of the scientific method and\nhighlighting the potential importance\nof our Sun in the search for dark energy.\nOliver Nash Science Writer\nDark energy is driving the accelerating expansion of the universe, yet its nature remains a\ncomplete mystery. Oliver Nash explores how measurements from the Sun can be leveraged to\ntest this mysterious form of energy \u2014 dark energy.\nGraphical representation of the exapansion of the universe from the Big Bang\nto the present day.\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\n\n"
