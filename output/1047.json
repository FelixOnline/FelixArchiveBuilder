    "content": "book: an anthropologist on mars oliver sad cs^, \u2122 * \u2122 *\n'Adaptation follows\na different path in\neach person\". So\nstates Oliver Sacks\nin the preface to this\nbook of neurology\ncase studies. Sacks is\na Professor of\nNeurology in New\nYork and has written numerous other\nworks including\n\"The Man Who\nMistook His Wife\nfor a Hat\".\nIn the studies of his\npersonal patients presented here , a sense of care\ndoes shine through, even when the subject\nseems at their most perplexing. Cases are presented in a digestible thirty-odd page format and\nit is quite possible to dip into this book from time\nto time - indeed a continuous read could prove\nheavy going. Amongst others there is the story of\nthe painter who went colour blind, painting an\nentirely new perspective of the world, and a Grateful Dead fan who lost much of his mind.\nAt the same time, the studies are darkly\nhumorous: the Grateful Dead fan referred to by\nSacks had effectively had a frontal lobotomy - a process misguidedly carried out on other unfortunates by a Nobel Award winner in the 1930s according to the following procedure:\n\"Knock them out with a shock... thrust an ice\npick up between the eyeball and the eyelid\nthrough the roof of the orbital actually into the\nfrontal lobe of the brain and making the lateral\ncut by swinging the thing from side to side... [the\nonly side effects have been] a very black eye in\none case[I] There may be trouble later on but it\nseemed fairly easy, although definitely a disagreeable thing to watch.\" Mr Sacks is quick to\ncomment on the horror of this operation but\ngoes on to say that is was used until the 50s, when drugs to 'shut the patient up' came into\nvogue.\nOliver Sack's writing has been described as\n\"wonderfully iU um in a ting\" by other newspapers,\nbut I found the book dry and technical; there are\nan awful lot of footnotes which often just distract from the case study. I thought this book\nwould be of interest to amateur psychologists,\nbut it seems more appropriate for the neurologists, or at least the biologists, among us.\nan anthropologist on mars b v pap'ib.K.k this week by\nPicador, price \u00a36.99\nsimon baker As some our finest sages and\nphilosophers have pointed out,\nit's a funny old world. The\nDuchess of York, facing die\nthreat of bankruptcy, starts cutting costs by flying to New York\non Concorde. The Maxwell\nBrothers, who everyone allegedly thought were\nas guilty as puppies sitting next to piles of poo,\nare acquitted. The ICU Rag Chair allegedly\nblames the poor Rag week total on 'the we a th er.' To raise a mere 20\u00b0/) of last year's total from\nbroadly the same range of events must surely\nimply that something more serious is to blame.\nHe goes on suggest the problems concerning the\nRag chair (sounds like a piece of MFI furniture)\nare responsible as well. Does he seriously believe\nthat half the beer was left un drunk because people were concerned by the actions of Richard\nWillis, a man who very generously dished out\nfree vodka? I thought that I had got this off my\nchest last term, and apologise for banging on\nabout it (doing a Trev Addenbrooke as we call it\nin the trade), but Rag has now made the transition from joke to embarrassment and is failing\nmiserably in its sole task.\nThose of you, God bless ya, who are regular\nreaders of this column will remember my rant\non College Catering early last term, in which I said 'the sandwiches in the JCR are fairly good,\nand I challenge anyone to find a better pint at\nsuch a price as Southside provides.' While the\nlatter is as true now as it was then, the comment\non sandwiches has haunted me ever since. I did\nnot realise at the time that the prices had been\njacked up enormously, as\nmuch as 30-40%, but the\nquality remained about the\nsame. This term I have\nnoticed that standards have\nclipped very noticeably. There\nis now no way that their price\ncan be justified at a time when\ninflation is low and wage claims are fairly mod-est. This appalling situation, where very successful ventures such as Southside Bar and QT are\nused to bail out the laughably unprofitable\nM DH is unacceptable. These separate businesses should be split and the main catering put out\nto tender. The current management are clearly\nnot up to the task, using their effective monopoly position to stick two fingers up at the long-suffering customers by raising prices, rather than\nfighting to keep costs down and quality up.\nEnough is enough.\nI'm sure that I was not alone in shedding a tear on hearing of the divorce of Michael Jackson\nand Lisa Marie Presley. A partnership hadn't seemed so perfect since Liz Taylor and... thingy.\nHopefully this marks the beginning of the end of\nWhacko, who seems capable of absolutely anything to suppress allegations of child abuse.\nMarriage contract has never been such an appropriate term. Most people make do with a couple\nof bridesmaids, but these two spent more on\nlawyers than OJ Simpson to stitch together a deal to keep him free and, judging from the pic-ture s, her miserable. The chances of those two\nfinding love were about as good as finding\namusement in a Rag mag. Oh bugger, I'm at it\nagain!\nn "

FELIX FRIDAY JANUARY 26TH1996 PHOTO: WILLIAM LORENZ Students' chocolate cravings had to be resisted for a few days when\nthe newly installed snack machine promptly broke down on its first\nday at ICU. It was repaired on Wednesday, but broke again later\nthat evening.\nMary' sHIV prisoner freed from chains BY DIPAK GHOSH\nA drug addict on remand at\nHolloway prison who was kept\nchained whilst receiving treatment at St Mary's Hospital has\nhad her chains removed. She had\nbeen kept handcuffed for nine\ndays while a patient at the specialist HIV unit.\nThe 34 year-old woman\npatient, known only as 'Jane', is\nseriously ill with HIV related\ncomplications. A massive public\noutcry, instigated by the national\npress, led to the chains being\nremoved. The campaign forced\nministers to soften the controversial 'cuffing and chaining' policy at Holloway, especially where\npregnant or sick women were\ninvolved.\nJane's case, which was highlighted by the Independent on\nSunday, has triggered condemnation from health workers and\nwomen's and human rights\ngroups. The 'cuffing and chain-ing' policy failed to discriminate\nbetween those who posed a security risk and those who did not.\nThe decision to remove the\nchains was reached after negotiations between St Mary's Hospital\nand Prison Service officials.\n'Jane' was said to delighted. She\nhad been chained even when she\nwent to the lavatory and when\nshe slept.\nHer lawyers are considering\nwhether to sue the Home Office\nfor damages. They are also considering a judicial review of the\npolicy, which they claim breaches the Government's obligations\nunder the Convention on Human\nRights.\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nBMS site in safety\nwaste fear\nIan Gillett, head of the College\nSafety Unit, has been quelling\nfears over the possible discovery\nof dangerous waste at the site of\nthe new BMS building, currently\nunder construction next to the\nChemistry Department. \"As far\nas the building's concerned,\nthere's been no toxic waste,\" he\nsaid. He added that other routine\nwaste, such as mercury and\nasbestos, was present at the site\nbut was being dealt with safely.\nIC's contractors, Schal, have\nbrought in analysts to locate\nthese substances so that they\ncould be removed successfully.\nHe stressed the importance\nof dealing with toxic substances\ncorrectly: \"If there is anything\nthere, I'd love to know about it.\"\nEarlier this week, STOIC,\nIC'sTV station, were asked to\nleave the site after attempting to\nfilm work on the project.\nKenneth Weir, the Deputy Head\nof Security, said this was likely to\nhave been due to the safety\naspects of their presence.\nPermission to photograph the\ndevelopment now has to be\nobtained from College's Estates\nDepartment.\nC&G's Hovercraft\nIn a separate development, the\nCity & Guilds Union (C& GU)\nHoverclub were able to reclaim\ntheir hovercraft after it had been\nleft in storage in a garage in the\nchemistry building due to be\ndemolished. According to a foreman at the site, Planning Officer\nBrian Dennis arranged for the\nvehicle to be moved to behind\nthe RCS1 building on\nWednesday.\nHowever, the students say\nthey are unhappy with the way\nthey have been treated. Austin\nJones, Honorary Secretary of the\nC& GU Motor Club, said that\nthey had been unable to move\nthe hovercraft earlier because\nthey had no alternative storage\nspace for it. He added that the\nEstates Department had been\napproached for help, as well as\nICU. \"Tim Townend was repeatedly asked and has done no th ing,\" he said.\nAustin said that they had\nlost the five parking spaces that\nthe club once used. He felt that\ncollege \"don't care about the\nMotor Club\" saying that they\nseemed to think \"it's not their\nproblem.\" Neither Tim Townend\nnor Estates were available for\ncomment as Felix was going to\npress.\nRug in RH picture\nICU's front doormat, pinched by\nRoyal Holloway students in a raid last term, was the subject of\nan article in Orbital, their college\nnewspaper. The piece, accompanied by a photo of the rug,\noffered some insight into the\nmotives for the attack. One student claimed that it could have\nbeen taken as a revenge attack\nafter IC students stole Royal\nHolloway \"union's cuddly toy\nmascot Collossus, burnt it and\nlater returned its ashes as a practical joke\".\nThe rug itself has been\nreturned, though it is unclear\nhow ICU responded to the stu-dent's suggestion that \"We\nshould chop it up and send it\nback a piece at a time.\"\nFinance Society\nPenniless\nFelix has learned that IC's Finance Society has become\n'financially embarrassed'. On account of the poor state of their\nbalance book, they are no longer\npermitted to incur any more\ndebts until the situation\nimproves.\nRag Chair Apology\nLast week's Felix (1046) inaccurately reported that Rag Chair\nJon Lambert had \"blamed the\nweather\" for the drop in Rag's takings from the beer festival this\nyear. In fact he had really blamed\nthe fact that the sports teams\nwere playing away that day. Felix\nwould like to apologise to Jon\nLambert for the misunderstand-ing.\n\n"

    "content": "zin*g ht \u00b0\nMagnets to Heal our Hearts and Minds\nMichael Faraday would almost certainly have liked it. It seems magnetic fields can now be used to treat\npatients with weak hearts, neurological diseases and even mental illness.\nActually, it has been known for a long\ntime that you can use magnets to\ninduce electric currents in living tis-sue. The principle is very simple.\nFaraday came up with it in the 1860s. The idea\nis this: you have a magnetic field and you make\nthe strength of this field vary with time. Then,\nwhen you put this 'wiggly' magnetic field near\nsomething that conducts electricity, you will generate a wiggly current (radios, motors, and\ndynamos all rely on this phenomenon).\nThe human body's has its own circuitry - the\nnervous system. Electrical signals in the nerves\ncause chemical changes and also make our muscles work. This means a magnetic field can be\nused to artificially stimulate muscles and nerves.\nLast May, a company from Wales called\nMagstim and a research team at the Department\nSdentopical\nr~n he Government has again refused to set up |\nJL a commission to oversee all areas of act iv i ty in the field of genetics. This \"complacence\nhas been slammed by MPs who are concerned\nthat lack of controls could lead to serious a bus< in areas such as gene patenting, genetic screen\ning and detection of genetic disorders.\nthe\n'the\no cut li is problem is being drafted\nfrom the Jupiter space probe Galileo\n3 by\nf ter Left: Silvanus P. Thompson tries to magnetically stimulate his brain, (london 1910.) Right:\nA patient receives treatment for depression with a clinical magnetic nerve sti mul at or. of Physiology at Liverpool University started\nclinical trials on sheep to test a prototype 'mag-ne tics tim ul at or' device.\nShoulder Transplant\nMagstim is looking at how their sti mul at or can\nhelp people who suffer from a particular heart\ncondition where the heart muscle is too weak to\nfunction properly. The obvious solution is a transplant but unfortunately new hearts aren't easy to come by. Instead surgeons use a technique called car dio my op last y.A muscle is\nstripped from the patient's shoulder and\nwrapped around their heart to strengthen it.\nThe problem with this procedure is the new\nmuscle gets very tired - shoulder muscles are\nA magic wand for healing the brain?\njust not designed to contract thousands of times\na day. But Magstim hope to solve this problem.\nDr Jalinous of Magstim says, \"The idea is to\nreduce the time taken for the patient to recover\nfrom the operation by stimulating the patient's shoulder muscle for a couple of hours each day\nbefore the operation.\" When the muscle is transferred to the heart it will be more effective. The\ntests on sheep will determine how much stimulation is needed.\nTherapy for Depression\nIt sounds unlikely, but by just placing a magnetic\nnerve sti mul at or near the head it is possible to\ncure depression. Mark George's research at the\nNational Institute of Mental Health in\nWashington had a lot of success with this treatment last year. And now Magstim are looking at\nusing their sti mul at or on the brain for some therapeutic effects. The tiny currents generated by\nthe sti mul at or cause the brain to produce\nenzymes and other chemicals. Psychiatrists think\nthat these play a key role in certain types of mental illness.\nAlthough this research is very promising, Dr\nJalinous remains aware that there are problems\nassociated with magnetic stimulation. \"During\nstimulation of the brain, if you are not careful\nwith the frequency, the patient can suffer a seizure. Currently doctors use the unpopular\nelectrical sti mul at or which can cause short term\nmemory loss... However, the low powered,\nmore focal magnetic sti mul at or may avoid this\nside effect. Of course, anyone with apace mak er, a metal corset or a metal implant wouldn't be\na suitable candidate for\nmagnetic stimulation.\" Katharine Lewis\n\n"

Like cover\nversions of old top ten songs, Sabrina has been\nrefurbished and rewritten to go with a90's social\nmelody. Sabrina Fairchild (Ormond) is the\ndaughter of the Larrabee's chauffeur, her girlhood spent watching a particular member of the\nLarrabee family, David (Greg Kinnear), who's charm and love of parties had captivated her\nheart. This voyeurism ends when the slightly\nawkward and shy Sabrina is shipped off to Paris\nto work for Vogue magazine. Two years later she\nreturns and the Parisian atmosphere has rubbed\noff on her; gone are the goofy glasses and in place\nis mature sophistication.\nSabrina's return causes a flutter with David\nwhich in turn rocks the rest of the Larrabee fam-i ly. David's impending marriage to Elizabeth\nTyson is put at risk, and this endangers a merger\nbetween Elizabeth's father's company and the\nLarrabee family business (confused yet?).\nDavid's older brother, Linus (Ford), who runs\nthe family business, then intervenes to prevent\nthe merger from going sour.\nSabrina is a love story but also a fairy tale, so\nany hope of a serious study of a love triangle,\nwhere money is a motivation for love, goes out\nof the window in the first few minutes. This film\nis nothing if not sickly sweet, its romance\nadapted well to today's attitudes. However it is\neasy to see the 1950's influence seeping round\nthe edges; in a formal dinner party and a scene in\nan arboretum.\nThis film is very easy to watch and requires\nno effort at all, and this is probably where the\nfilm falters as it is extremely easy to forget.\nHarrison Ford and Julia Ormond are a mismatched couple for this film, but I suppose this\nis why fairy tales exist. Sabrina's cast and reliable\nstory line prevents this film from being\nmediocre. Despite being a rehash of a golden\noldie this is undeniably romantically satisfying.\nn dals \"film: angels and insects\nThis film may not be what you would expect\nfrom your standard historical drama. Granted,\nit has the sumptuous costumes, the incidental\nchamber music and the somewhat formalised\nspeech. However, there is no glorification of this\npast, and it is into its own future that it is look-ing.\nThe story centres around a young explorer\nscientist, rec end y returned from a period in the\nAmazon and now residing in a stately home. His\nstay in the household rests on the charity of his\npatron for whom he is cataloguing a large biological collection. Although highly intelligent his low\nclass makes him wary of expounding his new\nf angled Darwinian views. To complicate matters,\nthe young man also falls for the physical charms\nof his patron's daughter, far above his realistic\nclass aspirations. Surprisingly she agrees to marry\nhim.\nHowever, this was not the crux of the film,\nand the story is far from closed. His new brother-in-law can barely hold at bay his antagonism for\nthis lower class usurper. His wife's love for him\nswings by great degrees, and this seems to be\nexpressed only physically. The only intellectual\ncompanionship he can find is that of the childrens' governess. Obviously this is not a stable\nstate of affairs.\nAs mentioned above, the raison d'e tre of the\nfilm is not to wallow sumptuous ly in a glorified\npast. Instead it contains two things. One is a wonder of nature. Together with the governess\nand her charges they observe and record the natural life of the grounds around the house, particularly the yearly cycle of a colony of ants. The\nsecond is a sense of relief that the depicted class\nstructures of the past are, if not extinct, very\nmuch marginal is ed. Instead, intelligence and\nhard work have their rewards, monetary and\notherwise, and it is the 'otherwise' part that\ncounts when it comes to happiness.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 26TH JANUARY 1 9 9 6 . FIVE\nIn a week when\nwe'll see the second\ndouble roll over in a row, we ask:\nAre we going lot to crazy? Welcome... This week, I have\nconsulted the runes of\nBottomley to make my predictions. The crystal ball is clear-ing, and Is eeee that if you have\nlots of money already, yoo ou will not be playing the lottery. A cleaning team will be lucky this\nwee eek. A generous maa an with a ginger hair and a virgin\ninterest will not be pleased.\nBlack cats and four leaf clovers\nwill also be lucky. The numbers\n5, 31 and 42,000,000 will be\nsignificant this we eek. If you\nlike cheese, yoo ou could be\nlucky toda a a ay. If you truly\nbelieve that you will ll win this\nwee eek, then you are crazier\nthan m eeeeee eeeeee eeee. Number Q So now to the most imp or C tant question: how to pick 3\nthose six numbers? The\nmajority of the population \u201e\nseem to go for birthdays, 3\n'lucky' numbers or numbers\nthat have come up in draw\nbefore. I myself favour drawing\nlittle matchstick men with the\nboxes, but I 've never won so I can't recommend that method.\nIf you're really stuck then you\ncan buy a lotto pen or even a mini version of Ihe machines.\nJust remember that whatever\nnumbers you choose you have\nthe same chance, and anyone\nwho says otherwise is wrong.\nThe queues stretching for miles from the kiosk\nat Sainsbury's can only mean one thing - it's Saturday afternoon, and the nation is once\nagain possessed by the maniacal desire to get\nrich quick. And with the second opportunity to\nwin \u00a340M coming up, the queues this week\nwill be even longer. It wes estimated that in\nthe last double-roll over week, 80% of the population succumbed to temptation and parted\nwith at least one ticket in the quest to become\na: multi-millionaire.\nVirginia Bottomley claimed that our Lottery\nis 'more successful' than most others in\nEurope. But how can you measure the success of something like a National Lottery? If\nit's measured by the amount of headline news-it makes, then ours is definitely the most successful. The \u00a342 million jackpot even made\nheadline news on, German television. The\nnear-miss of two planes at a German airport\n(the worst air-traffic control mistake in recent\nhistory) was the second news item that day. If?\nthis is a measure of success, then we are\ndoing very well indeed.\nBut who really stands to gain from this?\nOur government certainly receives substantial\namounts through it. Perhaps this is Virginia\nBottomley's definition of success. Or it could\nbe the profits made by Camelot Group, who\nrun the lottery. These would probably indicate\nsuccess for the lottery.\nThere are also the charities and so-called\ngood causes to which some of every pound\ngoes. After the fiasco at the beginning, the\ncharities are at last receiving their money. The\narts council and the sports council are continuing to receive very large grants for their pro-j ect s, but smaller charities seem to be somewhat less successful.\n:?\u00bb\u201e. Titen of course, there are the pri zn ers. j rely gain fr or prize-wir t lottery. So\nei ot arranges Tinancial adv irs for the winners! After all,\ni dual do with \u00a340M? Build\n>nal motorway, perhaps? Or\ns rha psa hospital for the\n:\nor the many victims of the\nten I come to think about it,\nwith \u00a340M. But I am also\nI walk straight past the queues at the kiosk\nin Sainsbury's every week. 1 walked past them\nin the last double roll-over jackpot, and I shall:\nbuy a copy of the Big Issue instead. It costs\n30p less than a lottery ticket, it's entertainment value lasts for longer, and it benefits the\npeople who really need it. And, perhaps best\nf if all - it doesn't involve watching Anthea\nTurner or Mystic Meg on T.V. Marcia Symonds & Mark Baker\nFlying the flag for charities: The National Lottery Charities Board The National Lottery Charities Board exists to\nmake grants to organisations which are established for charitable, benevolent or philanthropic purposes.\nEligible organisations include tenants' and\nresidents' associations, Housing associations\nand some self-help groups. Individuals, profit-making companies and health authorities are\nnot eligible for grants, and the Board has indicated that it will not fund activities that are the\nresponsibility of the Government. So far the\nboard has approved over 1200 grants totalling\n\u00a3160 million. An organisation can apply for\nany amount from \u00a3500 upwards, and does\nnot have to 'match' part of the grant with their\nown fundraising.\nThe Board has decided that the best way\nto deal with the huge amount of applications\nfor grants (over 14,000 totalling \u00a32 billion) is\nto allocate grants in themed blocks. The\nthemes are as follows;\nCommunities, families and individuals\ndisadvantaged by low income for the first\nround.\nHealth, Disability and Care this spring.\nNew Opportunities and Choices this sum-mer.\nImproving People's Living Environment\nthis winter.\nCommunity Involvement in spring 1997.\n\n"

'Bruise Pristine' and 'Come\nHome' shine out amongst a set full of teeth grind-ing, guitar noise churned out at a helter-skelter\npace.\nNext band on, Mansun, have a lead singer\nwho sports an attractive, Reni-style hat. They\nbegin with recent single, \"lake It Easy Chicken'.\nUnfortunately, it seems that they only have one\nsong, and this lack of originality offsets the stage\npresence that they do possess. Never mind.\nOn come Geordie rockers, China Drum,\nwhose fast and furious melody-shredding thrash\nsends the crowd into a frenzy. Between songs\nthere is some abuse shouted about Northerners\nwhich the band join in with until some unpleasant\ncomments are made about the lead singer's widening girth. As a result, die Dmrnrnies decide\nto culminate their fine set by leaving in style: they\nstage-dive on to the crowd.\nJohn Power and company have been busy\nover the last few months since the release of their\nfirst single, 'Finetime'. They have played numerous shows and their experience is beginning to\nshow. They look relaxed and confident on stage,\nbut they don't have the arrogant swagger of Oasis\n- more the look of a group who know that things\nare going their way. The bulk of their set comes\nfrom their debut album, All Change'. Highlights\ninclude 'Alright', which gets everyone pogo-ing,\nand the psychedelic jam, 'History'. Alas, all good\nthings come to an end, and we are left to despair\nas a powerful performance of near epic proportions comes to an end.\nIMiMXM\nCUS f album: spectre the missing two weeks i \u2122\nThere is no doubt about it - dub is undergoing\nsomething of a renaissance at the moment and\nthis work of art could well be a Da Vinci, even if\nhe has been on the ganj... and watching too much\nJames Bond. This rebirth has been helped by people like Spectre investing in some state of the art\nequipment and putting some interesting new\nsounds on top of the ageing dub framework. It has\nalso been helped by an increased interest in music\nfor chilling out to.\nSpectre have taken their name from bad guys\nin 007 films (g 'duh) and tried to instil the essence\nof Vincent Price or Telly Savalas. It sounds cheesy,\nespecially with the '70s wah-wah guitar and hammond organ sounds, but it's all very sub de. Consequentiy, this is an excellent post-club\nsoundtrack, and provides something to unwind to\nat 7 a.m. on Saturday mornings, or indeed at any\nother time that you're feeling mellow.\nThis is possibly the first post-modernist take\non dub, but far from being wallpaper music,\ninstead it contains walls which have eyes that follow you around the room. This is well worth\nchecking out by dub a ff ici on a dos and chill-out\nmerchants anywhere. (9)\nalbum: deep purple pur p end icu lari uc a For a moment, forget all the connotations associated with Deep Purple - perpetrators of the awful\n'Smoke on Water' - and their image as a real-life\nSpinal Tap wi di out even the merest hint of irony.\nThey had two (and only two, mind) good songs.\nRitchie Blackmore, riff meister horr i bilis, later to\nbe associated with the emetic 'Since You've Been\nGone' (with Rainbow) showed surprising sensitivity and emotive guitar art i ucla tion with the\ncathartic 'When A Blind Man Cries', while on the\nsomewhat funky 'Emeretta', strains of Hendrix\ncan be heard to good effect (without being obviously derivative).\nNow in their 27th year, Deep Purple are\nreleasing their 26th album. Cries of, \"Oh dear\"\nwere heard from my fellow reviewers when I volunteered to take this album. Sure enough, Deep\nPurple are not th e most credible band. But that\ndidn't bother me -1 was merely interested to hear\nhow they had evolved.\nWith the \"Classic Mark 2 line-up\" minus\nBlackmore and plus Steve Morse, they trawl\nthrough regions that lie between soft and hard\nrock, playing (just as I had expected) smug, self-congratulatory mu so rubbish. This isn't necessarily bad, but judging by their press release, they\nobviously take themselves really seriously, and\nthat is baa ad. For example, Roger Glover\ndescribes the recording sessions as 'magic\nmoments'. Any fool who listens to this album can\nsee that is about as magic as watching your washing machine do the laundry. And what kind of tide is 'Purpendicular? Oh, pur-lease (er, sorry -please), what a bad pun.\nThis is definitely best avoided. (1)\nAmbient dance music that I can't get enough of.

After 34 minutes when the score was 2-1, a through ball split IC's defence.\nShowing his alertness Stuart\nCook, the 'keeper, raced out of\nhis area only to be beaten to the\nball by the striker whose first\ntime shot into the 'keeper's body struck the keeper's hands.\nThe referee judged that it was\ndeliberate hand-ball and despite\nheated protests the Hitleresque\nreferee sent off the crest-fallen\n'keeper.

The second\nhalf produced a determined and\ngutsy performance by the ten\nmen of IC and it is to their credit that the team did not collapse\nas surely they would have done\nearlier in the season.\nSpeaking after the game\nStuart Cook said that he could\nhardly believe that he had been\nsent off for the first time in his\ncareer. He recollected various\nsimilar incidents where \"proper\"\nqualified referees, on telly, had\nused their common-sense and\ndistinguished between deliberate goal saving hand-ball and\naccidental hand-ball.\nThe IC Fencing club continued it's impressive winning\nstreak with a comfortable victory over Salle Michael Joseph last\nweek by 45-39.

    "content": "theatre: the glass menagerie\nclaire samuel\nSet in St Louis during the 1930's, just before the\nGreat Depression, this is the story of an overbearing mother, Amanda Wingfield (Zoe\nWanamaker), brought up on the affluent Deep\nSouth plantations, and her children, Tom and the\ncrippled Laura. Amanda awaits daily a stream of\n'gentlemen callers' to court her daughter but\nunlike in her own youth, they never arrive. The\nconstant reminder of the mother's hopes and\nplans for her children has made them 'different'.\nLaura escapes her deformity and pressure of\nmarriage by doting on her collection of delicate\nglass animals, her menagerie. Tom, however,\nfinds the excitement and romance he craves\naway form the mundane warehouse job he has\ntaken to support his family since his father left,\nand escapes the frequent family rows by writing\npoetry and going to the movies.\nZoe Wanamaker portrays excellently a domineering mother who is determined her children\nshould make something of their lives and not\nmake the mistakes that she made, but in her\npursuit is blinded to the situations and desires of\nher cli ld ren. Ben Walden as Tom Wingfield wonderfully expresses the frustration and repression\nof Iris circumstances dr at is contrasted with the\nsilent introspection of his sister (Claire Skinner).\nThe set, Simple and atmospheric with its\nblue/grey lighting, has the appearance of a well\nkept, affluent home but with the backdrop of\nthe American metal fire escape which encircles\nthe auditorium, is a constant reminder of the\nconflict of fading hopes and reality.

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY JANUARY 26TH1995 NEWS\nAUT resist pay freeze and seek rise\nLecturers express concern over their future BY DIPAK GHOSH\nThe President of Imperial\nCollege branch of the Association\nof University Teachers, Brian\nWilson, has pledged to resist the\n7% cuts in higher education funding which have been imposed on\nthe sector. The drop in funding is\nequivalent to \u00a3300m in real\nterms.\nSpeaking to Felix, he also\nsaid that the AUT will strive to\nprotect their members. The\nAUT's view is that there should\nnot be any cuts in staff and if\nneed be then cuts should be\nmade in other areas. Adequate\nand quality staff are essential in\norder for a university to run prop-e rly. With the cuts in funding,\nthere are fears over lecturer's pay\nand top-up fees. Brian Wilson\ncommented that approximately\n80% of the College's money is\nspent on staff salaries, so the\ntemp ation is there to limit this by\na pay freeze and staff cuts. He\nwent onto say \"the college should\nbe able to retain all staff and pay\nthem fair salaries from turnover...\nsuch as research contracts.\"\nNoting that academic staff\nare paid comparatively less than\nother professions, and that they\nrecieved smaller increases in pay,\nhe stressed that academic staff\ndeserve more for their work. \"We\nare expected to cope with\nincreasing student numbers with\nless and less staff\" he said.\n\"University lecturers are also\nexpected to spend at least 50% of\ntheir time on research. We also\nhave the duty of handling more\nand more students. Organizing\n[teaching] also takes a lot of time\nand effort and this... is increasingly getting heavy. We are very\nkeen to maintain the quality of\nteaching and research here... but\nat the same time the numbers of\nback up staff... are increasingly\nreduced.\"\nOn the matter of top-up\nfees, Mr Wilson said that \"the\nAUT is against any sort of student fees in whatever guise.\nBasically in present form, this\ntop-up fee is an ad hoc way of\nrecovering the funding cuts,\nwithout proper understanding\nespecially in big cities. The whole\nthing has to reviewed.\"\nMr Wilson also expressed\nconcerns relating to increasing\n'casual is atai on' of academic staff:\n\"Temporary staff are increasingly\nbeing employed in many universi-ties. IC have tried to avoid\nemploying short-term staff\nbecause it has realized that it is\ndeleterious to IC's reputation as a leading teaching and research\ninstitution.\n\"There is also an increasing\ntrend in universities to use temporary lecturers and researchers\nbecause universities are not as\nsecure as they used to be.\" When\nasked to expand on this, he said\nthat the government used to provide funding on a5 yearly basis\nand every university knew how\nmuch it had so it could plan\nahead, whereas now universities\nare less certain about how much\nfunding they will receive.\nThe AUT is now formulating\na document to submit to the\nCVC P, in which they demand a modest increase in salaries and a readjustment of the salary scale\non behalf of their members. This\nmotion will then be sent to the\ngovernment.\nPraise for students reaction to burglar\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nStudents of the Southside halls\nof residence came in for praise\nover their role in the apprehension of a suspected burglar last\nThursday. The alarm was raised\nby students when a computer\nand a stereo hi-fi were discovered\nin a bathroom (Stop Press, Felix\n1046).\nKenneth Weir, the new\nDeputy Head of Security, was\nparticular y impressed with those\nresidents who stopped and challenged the intruder, and subsequently reported him to the\nhousekeeper. A number of sightings of a man behaving suspiciously were reported, and after\nthe missing electrical equipment\nwas found, security were notified. The security response to the\nintruder was to monitor the exits\nto the building, and then to\nsearch the building for the man,\nsaid to be young, Asian and wearing a dark blue jersey and jeans.\nWithin thirty minutes, a man fitting that description had been\napprehended on the upper gallery\nby security officers. When he\nfailed to provide a satisfactory\nreason for his presence, he was\ntaken to the security lodge and\nheld there until the police\narrived. At the time of going to\npress, the suspect's name has not\nbeen released, and a link between\nthe misappropriated property\nand the intruder has not yet been\nfirmly established.\nSpeculating on how the burglar might have gained entry to\nthe hall, Mr Weir said that the\nmost likely way was for him to\nhave followed another student\nwhen they entered the hall. He\ndid concede, however, that there\nwas a security weak point where\ncontractors working in Southside\nhave access to the building,\nthough it was being covered in a current security review.\nPHOTO: WILLIAM LORENZ The new Deputy Head of Security, Kenneth Weir, and his secretary.\nWeeks Hall thief gets four months The burglar who was caught after plaguing Week's Hall last\nterm has been sentenced to four month's imprisonment by\nHorseferry Road Magistrate's court.\nThe thief, named as Mr Alex Jefferies, was arrested by the\npolice on the 22nd November last year for attempted burglary and\nwas remanded into custody until his court appearance on January\n5th. At the trial, 13 other convictions were taken into account.\n\n"

IC will now have to wait until\nnext month before their planning\napplication can be considered.\nIan Caldwell, IC Estates\nDirector said that he 'was under\nthe impression' that the proposal\nwould be considered at Tuesday's planning officers' meeting and he\nadmitted that 'we're obviously\ngetting somewhat concerned.'\nBut he insisted that the building\nwould still be on target if planning was granted at the meeting\nnext month.

But other universities less close to industry will suffer at yet another step by the\nGovernment to reduce research\nfunding as a result of budget\ncuts. The press release announcing the initiative lists alternative\nsources as industry, charities and\ngovernment departments. It is\nclear, however, that the majority\nof funds will come from indus-try. Those institutions which can\nexploit their relationship with\nindustry will receive double\nmoney, those that cannot will\nhave no access to the funds.\nThe new scheme increases\nthe already high pressure on\nresearch institutes and universities to find funding from private\nindustry.

Thankfully we can deal with that faster\nthan it takes the Southside Shop to sell something\nwith a100% profit mar-gin. After all, you d never\nheard of Portishead,\nOasis or Metallica once\nupon a time had you?\nOn the other hand, I can think of numerous\nreasons why you ought\nto buy this album. Firstly,\nthe Galactic Cowboys\nare plain funny. Not content with having a second\nalbum called 'Space In Your Face', they have now\nreleased an album that pokes fun at the fact that\nso many bands these days seem to use the words\n'Machine' (Rage Against The Macbine, Machine\nHead, etc.) and 'Fish' (Fish, Fishbone, Phish,\nJellyfish etc.) in their monickers.\nSecondly, they sing about serious matters but\ntheir sense of fun pervades throughout and they\nare neither preach-y nor teach-y 'Psychotic\nCompanion bemoans the unwarranted credence\ngiven to fortune-tellers and astrologers, while\n'Stress and'Fear Not are positive but honest stories of personal struggle.\nThirdly, they are one of the most original\nbands on the planet. Heavy guitar riffs collide\nwith angelic harmonies,\nand although the quirks\nof old have mainly been\ndispensed with, there's more musical talent and\ngreat songs than you'll\nfind in the average per-son's record collection.\nFourthly, the Galactic\nCowboys, far from\nbeing macho metal-heads, are sensitive and are\nnot afraid to show it. Listen to 'Easy To Love' and\nArrow' and check that you end up brushing back\nthe tears. If you don't cry then find a sledgehammer and take it to your ice-cold heart.\nIn summary, the Galactic Cowboys have a sense of humour, are innovative not derivative,\nand play music that scales the heights of sub lim in it y. Buy or remain forever unfulfilled. (9)\n- mini album: saint etienne dah ores erection trout face This is strange indeed. For a start, it's mos dy in\nFrench. This is because 'Reserection' is the result\nof a collaboration between Saint Etienne and\nsome French blok e, Mr. Daho, who raps a bit.\nHence, the snappy name...\nWe kick off with the tide track. Fifty-five seconds of that French blok e talking French. Great.\nWe move on to 'Jungle Pulse'. This is surprisingly\npleasant, with Daho's and Sarah Cracknell's close,\nbilingual harmonics rising over a hypnotic, wah-wah inspired groove.\nThe fun stops there and it is with a heavy\nheart that I must condemn this record to rot in\nthe bargain bin at Woolies. The final tunes ( X Amours', Accident' and 'Le Baiser Francais') do\nnot raise any hopes. Saint Etienne Daho were\nobviously hoping for a Portishead-style trip-rock\neffort with some kind of mysterious, Gallic twist.\nInstead, they ended up sounding awful. (4)\ngig: marc almond+ d if ford& til brook~ T\"m Calm On ti it tle jack home yI had serious misgivings about this gig. The devil\non my shoulder was asking tricky little questions\nlike, \"Why does it always come down to 'pop\nstars' to do benefits for things a responsible\nGovernment should be funding?\" and, \"Why\ndoes such a big issue always seem so ghetto-is ed. Another hospice benefit with a predominantly\ngay line up, playing to apr edom in andy gay crowd?\nWhere are the Take Thats of this world when you\nneed them?\" Still, I was here to review the music.\nThis bit of the review could write itself -McAlmont had a point to prove, namely that he\nwas the new diva in town. He was everything a true pop star should be - sassy, flamboyant and a flirt - he just needs another song that gets within\ns noggin g distance of 'Yes' and he could be winning\nhearts and minds.\nDifford & Ttlbrook seem to concentrate on\nminds, and their place on the bill seems a strange\none. Yes, they've written more classic numbers\nthan McAlmont's had songs, but it doesn't make\nthem interesting. Imagine two geography teachers\narmed with guitars, and you're virtually there.\nMessrs. Dull-but-Eamest.\nThis is not an accusation you could level at\nMarc Almond, the ultimate diva. As the song says,\nhe's still here. The trouble is that he's brought the\nband with him. The words \"delicate touch\" do\nnot enter this band's vocabulary, but what can you\nexpect when they contain an ex-member of Sigue\nSigue Sputnik? We get some Soft Cell songs and\na few new things, and though Marc seems genuinely happy to be on stage, I don't believe in him\nanymore. It's all one dimensional, and it careers\nonce too often towards Gary Glitter for comfort.\nI remember how he used to make your jaw drop\nwith his nerve, with the things he tried on stage,\nwith the quality of the material. Tonight he was\nokay, but for someone who really has meant\nsomething, okay isn't enough.\nAh well, I didn't have high expectations, and\nthey were matched. At least money was raised for\nthe Trinity Hospice, and at the end of the day I guess that's what really matters, not the bitter\nw hinge ing of someone who should know better.\n\n"

TWENTY-ONE\nLetters to Felix: With reference to Felix\n(issue 1046 January 19th1995), the BMS Action Group wish to\nstate wish to state that St. Mary's Hospital Union have never called\non ICU to make representation\nto Kensington and Chelsea borough council to try to block planning permission for the new Basic\nMedical Science building.\nThe BMS Action Group,\nformed last year to address such\nmatters, is made up of Sarah\nWhite, ICU President, and\nmedics from both SM HMS and\nCX WM S. It continues to raise\nobjections over the small allocation of student social space in the\nBMS - eg. the provision of a48 seater restaurant facility for a building with a potent al occupancy of 1400 people.\nFor the sake of good order,\nthe BMS Action Group would\nlike to correct the figures mentioned in the above article ie. the\nreduction in student space within\nthe BMS is from 826 m2 to little\nover 300 m2. In addition,\nalthough Ian Caldwell, Director\nof Estates, insists the provision\nfor student space within the BMS\nwas agreed with ICU during the\nsummer of 1995, Sarah White\nsays this was never the case.\nAt the council meeting last\nweek, there was a vote to accept\na motion, proposed by Sarah\nWhite, that ICU, and not just\nmedics, adopt a policy of\ndemanding adequate social and\nrecreational facilities of the highest quality at IC both now and in\nthe future.\nThe BMS Action Group considered this was far more constructive than trying to hold up\nplanning permission which would\nonly have served to be detrimental to all IC students. The issue of\ninadequate student social space is\na real problem now and will only\nget worse in 1998 with the arrival\nof the proposed 1400 students\nand staff of the new BMS building - this is an issue that will\naffect all IC students and not just\nthe Medics.\nThe BMS Action Group\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1048: 6pm, Monday 29nd Please bring your union card for identification.\nI1 he in d is pens abl contributors: monday, high noon :\nclubs & societies\narticles deadline\ne guide tor Felix and helpers tuesday noon\narts meeting\n1 he in d is pens abl contributors: monday, high noon :\nclubs & societies\narticles deadline\ntuesday 6pm features meeting\nmonday 1.20pm reviewers'\nmeeting\ntuesday 6pm features meeting\nmonday 1.20pm reviewers'\nmeeting\nthursday night\ncollating\nfriday morning\n: another Felix hits the\nstreet...\nmonday 6pm letters deadline\nthursday night\ncollating\nfriday morning\n: another Felix hits the\nstreet...\nmonday 6pm news meeting\nthursday night\ncollating\nfriday morning\n: another Felix hits the\nstreet...\nFELIX\nFOUNDED1949 PRODUCED FOR AND ON BEHALF OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION PUBLICATIONS BOARD\nPRINTED BY THE IMPERIAL CO LLE GE UNION PRINT UNIT\nBEIT QUAD PRINCE CONSORT ROAD LONDON SW72 BB TELEPHONE/FAX 0 1 7 1 5 9 4 8 0 7 2\nEDITOR: RACHEL WALTERS\nPRINTERS: ANDY THOMPSON AND JEREMY\nBUSINESS MANAGER: JULIETTE DE COCK COPYRIGHT FELIX 1996.\nISSN 1040-0711\nscary I had just about got over the\nfear and trembling that resulted\nafter my last trip to the cinema\n(in the sense that I could just\nabout bear to count to the number seven) when I made the\ndreadful mistake of walking\nthrough Green Park the other\nday.

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY JANUARY 26TH1996. THREE\nAldwych Group replies to budget\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nAttacks on the Government's policy on the funding of higher\neducation have been stepped up\nthis week. The Aldwych group of\nstudent unions has sent an open\nletter to the Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) restating its opposition\nto students being charged top-up\nfees.\nThe letter was written at last\nThursday's meeting of the group,\nwhich is concerned mainly with\nhigher education funding. The\nmeeting was attended by the\nICU President Sarah White. An accompanying article intended\nfor publication in the next edition of the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement is also\nbeing prepared. This is intended\nto make the position of student\nunions clear before the next\nmeeting of the CVC P on\nFebruary 2nd. They describe top-up fees as\n\"a short term option\", likely to\n\"legit i mise future reductions in\npublic spending by the\nGovernment\". The group points\nout that any altered funding sy sc emt in u ed from front page\nlikely to benefit from the new\nfund are those who already have\nclose relationships with industry.\nThis view is upheld by a spokesperson for the CVC P who\nsaid that \"if they [private invest-ors] provide money for equip-ment, they will want it to be used\nonly lor research projects they're\nalready funding.\"\nThis attitude is certainly true\nin the case of Imperial College,\nwhich is in a very strong position\nto do well out of this initiative.\nDr David Thomas, Pro Rector for\nResearch Contracts says that IC\nwill certainly be taking part,\n\"Imperial is well plugged into\nindustry, we will go hard at this\nand should succeed quite well.\"\nDr Thomas feels confident that\nthis will help Imperial to secure\nthe funds necessary to buy\ntern \"should be... the mechanism\nwe would like to have in place,\nnot rushed in because of a short-term crisis.\" They predict that\nattempting to combat inadequate\nfunding with top-up fees would\nfundamentally undermine the\nquality and accessibility of higher\neducation, and worsen the\nalready increasing rates of academic failure and dropping out.\nThe letter follows recent\nspeculation that Universities may\nbe forced to impose levies on students to make up for cuts in government funding. The cuts,\nannounced in last November's budget, reduce the total amount\nof money spent on higher e duca expensive equipment for the new\nmedical school.\nThe initiative was formulated after the budget, but the\nGovernment denies that it is due\nto the spending cuts. It will be\nrun as two competitions, com-petit on A with funds of \u00a35m will\ncover bids for equipment worth\nup to \u00a3250,000; competition B with \u00a313 million will cover bids\nfor items worth over \u00a3250,000.\nThis formula won't apply in\nWales where there will be just\none competition, and although\nthe competition has been\nannounced, entry details and\nguidelines have not yet been\nmade known.\nThis is not the first funding\ncompetition run by the\nGovernment; in 1995 there was a competition for IndustryAcademia collaboration. Entrants\ntion by over 31%. The Russell\ngroup of top universities, which\nincludes Imperial College, convened an emergency meeting in\nDecember to discuss the cuts,\nafter it was revealed that\nManchester University was being\nforced to consider top-up fees to\nachieve a sufficient level of fund-ing.\nImperial College has indicated that it is opposed to the idea,\npreferring to look to fees from\noverseas students to make up the\ndifference. In the long term,\nhowever, it may have no choice\nbut to charge students. University league tables published in\nrecent years have shown Imperial\nwere expected to describe their\nefforts and successes at building\ncollaborative links with industry.\nThe results of the competition\nwill be announced soon this year.\nThe two winners (one for science\nthe other for engineering) stand\nto receive a first prize of \u00a335,000\neach, the two runners up will\nreceive \u00a315,000.\nWhile this initiative is good\nnews for IC departments with\nclear industrial links, as Government funding for science\nresearch shrinks further, money\nfor areas of research that are\nunpopular with private industry\nwill have to be found elsewhere.\nResearchers' time will be taken\nup applying for elusive grants\ninstead of carrying out the research that they hope to pursue,\nthus making that research less\nefficient and more expensive.\nto have one of the highest levels\nof student funding in the co un try, and the College will have difficulty absorbing cuts of over \u00a32\nmillion a year.\nStudent opposition to top-up\nfees is becoming more vocal. Last\nweek, the president of Durham\nUniversity's SU called for \"a national campaign to get the\nrecent budget cuts into the\nnews\", and scheduled the 29th of\nFebruary as a national student\naction day [Felix 1046).\nHowever, this zeal is by no\nmeans universal. It has been\nnoted in some quarters that the\nNUS have been uncharacteristically lost for words. There have\nbeen suggestions that this is connected to the fact that the nomination stage of the body's National Executive elections\nreaches its climax this week.\nSarah White described its silence\nas \"surprising\", adding \"if I were\nin the NUS, I would expect them\nto campaign\". A spokesperson for\nthe NUS replied \"[we have been]\nmeeting [recently] with the\nCVC P\" and \"very much complaining about these cuts.\"\nSt Mary's in bed shortage BY DIPAK GHOSH\nSt Mary's Hospital has\nturned away 41 children with\nmeningitis to other hospitals in\nthe past year. Two of them died\nin December after the hospital\ncould not find beds for them.\nAccording to a newspaper study,\nthere is a nationwide bed and\nstaffing crisis in pae dra tic intensive care units.\nThe study revealed that\nother top hospitals not able to\ncope with demand for beds,\nincluded the Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital for Sick\nChildren.\nThe British Medical\nAssociation have called for\nimmediate action to resolve the\ncrisis.\nEurope-wide funding crisis looms\nThe rising tide of protest against cuts in higher education from both\nuniversities and students is not confined to Britain alone. Education\nministers from all over the European Union have been meeting\nrecently to discuss funding strategies for higher education across the\ncommunity. Many governments are under pressure to trim public\nspending on universities, leading to widespread protests in Germany\nand political disagreements within the French authorities them-selves. With funding schemes based on commercial involvement\nproving unpopular among universities, it is becoming more important for a viable strategy to be found.\nDouble whammy for IC "

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 26TH JANUARY 1 9 9 6 . SEVEN\nStakeholding:\nBlair's new baby examined\nWas Mr. Blair, in a past life, employed to make\nthe F.A Cup draw? I ask only because the manner\nin which he brings forth his election slogans is\nsimilar to the way in which Graham Kelly and\nfriends drew their own load of balls from from a smooth velvety bag. The latest offering to ooze\nfrom the pores Labour's Doctor of Spinology, Mr. Peter Mandelson, is the 'stake holder economy'.\nAn idea which has won the Labour leader an away\nwin in Singapore, but as everyone knows, it's the\nhome form that counts. Mr. Blair's choice of city\nto launch his latest idea illustrates the cautious\nnature of the Labour leader, and his incisive\nthinking: if the people of Derby (not so much a city as a perpetual lottery queue) can understand\nhis message, then the intellectual masses to whom\nhe is really appealing will have no difficulty.\nFrom the reception his latest toy received at\nDerby, it seems he will have difficulty in selling\nthis one. If, as Mr. Blair affirms, \"the stake holder economy is at the heart of the political battle\ntoday\", then the only people fighting it are those\non the Left searching for a definition of\n'stake holder'. The unions think that the existence\nof stakeholders will return their lost power.\nManagers believe that non-institutional\nshareholders will have greater power and Mr. Blair\n(I think) is promoting people power. Significantly,\nequal power.\nIn fact, the term is borrowed from business\nand modern management (hence the Singapore\nconnection). In the corporate world, as take holder is any group or individual who has an interest in the\nway the company is run and can, by their actions,\naffect the decisions of the company. The most\nclear example of stakeholders wielding power is in\nthe relationship between big business and the\nenvironment. Many companies recognise that\nignoring the pleas of environmental lobbyists can\nbe detrimental to the company in the long term.\nThere is no assumption in management, that\ndifferent groups (such as customers, shareholders,\nenvironmental groups etc.) have an equal stake.\nRather, it is accepted that some peoples' stake will\nbe bigger than others. The stake holder concept is\nsimply a recognition that there is a population\noutside the customer who are affected by the\nactivities of a company. The quandary that the\nLabour leader will find himself in if he attempts to\napply such a concept to the nation, is that if people\nare told that their 'stake' in the nation determines\nthe rewards they receive, then they will want to\nknow how big that stake is. The necessity to\nquantify how much each person holds will be\nunavoidable and several implications follow from\nthis.\nIf Mr. Blair is proposing real equality through\nstake holding, then he can't achieve it without\nmonstrous legislation. More than would be\nrequired if the UK were to accept the Social\nChapter of the Maastricht Treaty. The appeal of\nstake holding to Mr. Blair is clear, but it is a clever\nparadox which (unintentionally) displays the true\nparty colours that have been changed more often\nthan The Manchester United strip: in order to give\npeople greater power and a bigger say in their lives,\nit is in fact the Government that would end up\ndictating the terms of our lives. Lord alone knows\nhow long a Parliamentary session would be needed\nto ensure that the legislation was passed giving all\nsorts of rights and imposing inefficient practices on\nbusiness. The return to Centralist authority would\nentail all the traditional punitive tax measures and\nan inefficient bureaucratic regime to rubber stamp\nall decisions. This is on top of the new department\nthat would be charged with measuring our stakes.\nNew Labour would dismiss such a scenario as\nfantastic al, but they seriously need to ask\nthemselves exactly what this future Government\nwill do. The next election is approaching and could\neven be called in November of this year. Thus far\nthere has not been the semblance of a policy idea\nor a commitment of any resources to any purpose.\nAt least nothing more than the predictable\nopposition set pieces of better health care, better\nschools, safer streets and less tax.\nInstead of opting for a common sense approach\nto policy making, Mr. Blair seems determined to\nutilise the methods of management gurus and\napply them to UK Pic; in aping the behaviour of\nthese self styled Corporate Healers, he should be\naware that whilst they may inspire and create\nenthusiasm through exposing what is essentially\ncommon sense, they also manage to avoid\nprescribing detailed solutions to specific problems.\nThe guru doesn't actually 'do' anything. Mr. Blair\ncan't do that with the Country. His policies need\nsubstance - the discerning voter is unlikely to find\nmuch joy in any of Mr. Blair's current dishes,\nespecially his stakes.\nNooman Haque\n\n"
