    "content": "10 Music Special\nFlippin' Out With The Band To Be\nYou probably haven't heard of Gigolo Aunts yet, but when you hear them,\nyou '11 want them and we have them, so let Owain introduce them.\nThe Gigolo Auntsl Okay, so they're not\nhousehold names but we both suspect they have\na real chance of becoming big, and anyway\nthey've held guitars on the main stage at\nReading so they're stars enough for us.\nBlinded, we're taken to the flat they've\nrented in Notting Hill Gate. Phil Hurley, guitar\nmaestro, is being interviewed by Sweden's version of John Peel in another room. We're left\nwith Dave Gibbs, singer and guitar support.\nPhil's brother Steve isn't about and drummer\nPaul is munching a huge plate of pasta and\nleafing through a Felix. We try to act with\n'Mean Fiddler' nonchalance but unfortunately\nthat involves sitting in a corner and drinking out\nof a bottle, only whispering occasionally to your\nstoned partner. In other words, we have to buzz.\nIt's all too much for Tintin who duly asks the\nfirst question. It's a devilishly clever one.\n\"So, how did you first get together?\"\nDave of course is happy to be asked an easy\none first. This isn't Mastermind, remember - he\nresearched his stuff beforehand. For twenty odd\nyears.\n\"We grew up in a tiny little town in upstate\nNew York where we were basically the only\npeople who thought like we did. It took us ten\nyears to learn how to play because we absolutely\nsucked! Then we moved to Boston in 1987\nwhere all we did was practice, all day and all\nnight. Finally we put out a45 on my own label.\nIt's a tiny label, it's not even a mini label it's a micro label! We sent one to the fine folks at Fire\nand they liked it and so we did a deal.\"\n\"Got a hole in my head\nGot a hole in my heart\nGot a hole where my soul's supposed to be\nCan't you see? This is hard for me.\"\n- Cope\nOf course Fire are only a British label. Any\nchance of selling out stateside?\n\"Yeah, we're about to do a deal with a big\nfat cat major in the US. We're gonna be\ncorporate whores!\"\nThe relish Dave feels when he says that is\nself evident. It's not hard to see why it comes as\na relief to finally be committing to vinyl. Over a decade of relentless practicing, gigging, honing\ntheir sound to its purest elements, whether it be\nthe breezy hook ability of 'When I Find My Heaven' or the frantic angry fretwork on a song\nlike 'Cope'. Later, Phil talks of seeing a succession of labels sink away at inopportune\nmoments. Besides, if you spend your whole life\nat pop-school then in sheer practical terms your\ncareer options are going to be limited.\n\"This is all I can do,\" admits Dave. \"In\nbetween, Paul and Steve went to school; Phil\nand I didn't, so this is all I'm qualified for. I can\nwork in a record store and wash dishes and play\nin a band.\"\nAs the Aunts move towards 'the big time'\nDave finds himself wishing they could \"learn to\nbe more of a band\".\nLike in performance?\n\"Nah, not so much even that - stuff like photo\nsessions, interviews and just dealing with fans. I know this sounds really boring to people in the\nrecord press, but we treat all our fans as friends.\nWe're just friendly people.\"\nDave already has hang ups when it comes to\ndealing with the press. He's tired of reading\nquotes he didn't even say and, off-the-record, he\ntells us of a gig review where the journalist\napparently fabricated the entire performance and\nswapped his band's set with another's. Tintin\nand I quake.\n\"Basically, they dig those people up from\nunder stones. Like, they said we'ds lagged off\nSuede a year before we'd even heard of them!\nThey have to have a cover story every week and\nso they're going to go out and look for stuff. In\nAmerica they're just as dumb but they write for\nRolling Stone or Spin magazine which only\ncome out once a month, so they tend to write\nmore about the music.\"\nTintin remembers his ground notes and asks\nabout the recent NME interview.\n\"Yeah that went really well 'cos that guy has\na clue. NME and MM are basically like the\nNational Enquirer. Usually they don't write\nabout music, they want to write about what went\non backstage. They're just hacks - they can't write about music so they write about what\njumper the guy was wearing.\"\n\"In this country it seems they can't deal with\nnew bands unless they can find scenes to put\nthem in,\" I interject.\n\"Yeah, that don't even exist!\" Dave exclaims.\n\"What you don't know means\neverything to me.\"\n- Lullaby\nIt would be all to easy to sit the Aunts next to\nthe new folk y Lemonheads and, say, Buffalo\nTom and call it a new anti-grunge tr ad pop\nbacklash scene.\n\"That already happens! The first question\nanyone wants to ask us is 'So, are you big pals\nwith the Lemonheads?' I mean Evan Dando's a rich rock star and he lives in LA! Yeah, we are\nfriends with him but I wouldn't ring him up and\nsay 'So Evan, d 'ya wanna go for a movie?' I might see him after a show but that's about it.\"\nThese days it sometimes seems that if you\nrewire your keyboards to a washing machine,\nbring in a didgeridoo and cynically highlight the\nfact that one of your members is from an ethnic\nminority you're hailed as the new multi-cultural\nThis week's puzzle, another Elimination, is on page 23\n\n"

    "content": "News\nThief Thwarted\nBeer Festival - \"A Success\"\nThree tons of beer were quaffed from 1,200 glasses during the Royal\nCollege of Science Union's Beer Festival in the JCR on Wednesday, writes\nLynn Bravery.\nThe event, which launched this year's Rag Week was hailed as 'the\nbooziest night of the year'. It was proclaimed \"a success\" by Paul Thomas,\nthe event organiser. Accompanied by the sound of morris dancers merrily\njaping in the corner, Paul informed Felix that there had been \"no trouble at\nall\" and that he was \"very happy\" with the way things had gone. The\natmosphere of the place suggested that this year's Rag Week would be one\nto remember (or not, depending on whether you sampled any of the fine\nales on offer!).\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nCollege security, this week, foiled\nanother attempt at smash and grab\nvandalism. The attempt occurred in\nSouthside Bar on Tuesday morning.\nA man was disturbed while\nbreaking into a games machine,\nwhich he had dragged into one of\nthe bar's toilets. He is described as\nwhite, in his early twenties and\nabout 5' 10\" in height with a slim\nbuild. Witnesses reported that the\nman had been waiting in the bar\nfrom about 8am and was later seen\nattempting to enter Falmouth\nKeogh Hall.\nThe man managed to escape\nwhen challenged in Southside, but\nseveral bags of coins were\nrecovered by security.\nThis is the latest in a series of\nattempted thefts and vandalism in\nSouthside and the halls of\nresidences this term and crime in\ngeneral has been on the increase at\nImperial College this year.\nTriple First For IC\nBY PAUL DIAS\nThe first UK student branch of the\nInstitute of Electronic and Electrical\nEngineers (IEEE - pronounced Itriple-E) is set to start at Imperial\nCollege in two weeks' time. The\nIEEE is devoted to the promotion of\nprofessional standards in engineering\nindustries. Student membership at\nImperial College will be open to\nthose in the Electrical Engineering\nand Computing departments, as\nwell as those on the ISE\ncross-department course.\nAn interim committee, led by\nthird year Computing student Elen\nMarie Austenaa, is organising the\nlaunch of Imperial College's IEEE\nbranch. Students from eligible\ndepartments should contact Ms Austenaa for membership\napplication forms. Students can join\nthe international IEEE organisation\nfor the reduced fee of about \u00a315.\nThe committee post elections are to\nbe held on Wednesday 17th November.\nThe Imperial College student\nbranch hopes to hold talks by\nindustry representatives and visit\ncompanies along with a range of\nsocial events. Student members of\nthe IEEE will also be able to\nreceive publications covering the\nwhole range of industries supported\nby the IEEE.\nOne member of the interim\ncommittee said, \"We are extremely\npleased that the country's first IEEE\nstudent branch is to be at Imperial\nCollege, and we hope that as many\nstudents as possible will take the\nopportunity to join.\"\nNUS To Become A Charity\nBY SHAUN JOYNSON\nIn a move designed to protect itself\nfrom government reforms, the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\nhas announced plans to become a charity. The plan to apply for\ncharitable status was announced on\nMonday at the end of the\nDepartment For Education's30 day period of consultation over the\nfuture of student unions.\nThe NUS President, Lorna\nFitzsimmons, said of the move,\n\"Our charity will be in the best\ninterests of students\". The proposal\nto turn the NUS into a charity will\nbe put before the Charity\nCommissioners later this month.\nThe NUS hopes that the granting\nof charitable status will allow them\nto benefit from a wide range of\neducational grants which, at\npresent, they are ineligible for. A further benefit of the move, NUS\nleaders believe, is that it will allow\nthe Union to conduct paid\neducational research on behalf of\nclients in both education and\nindustry. \"This will benefit the\npublic, by providing them with\nuseful research on the quality of\neducation today,\" said Ms\nFitzsimmons.\nThe NUS claims that students\nwill be unaffected by its switch to\ncharitable status, as it is intended to\nsplit the organisation in two.\nStudent affairs would be handled by\nthe charity, whilst the campaigning\nwork would be handled by the main\nbody of the Union.\nOver the years, the NUS has\nbeen noted for its highly vocal\ncampaigning style on behalf of\nstudents. Suggestions that the move\nto charitable status will lead to the\ndemise of the NUS as a 'political'\npressure group were refuted in an\ninterview on IC Radio by NUS national executive member Ian\nMoore. \"There will still be a campaigning side of the NUS, but\nthat will take place in a separate\narm to the charity,\" said Mr Moore.\nDenying that the charity move\nwas a reaction to the government's apparent hostility towards the NUS,\nMr Moore told IC Radio News\nEditor, Paul Dias, that the matter\nhad been under consideration for a number of years. \"The government\nlegislation is looking at discouraging local students unions\nfrom affiliating to the NUS and,\nnaturally, we considered that when\nwe made the decision. By making\nthis move, we come under\ncharitable law, and can prove that\nthe money that we have is spent\nproperly.\"\nThe results of the NUS's change\nto a charity will not take effect for a few years, Mr Moore added. \"As a charity, we can apply for charitable\nand educational trust monies and\nthere are advantages in that. I hope\nwe're not going to be in the\nsituation where we've got begging\nbowls out and, hopefully, if the\ngovernment drops its ludicrous\nlegislative ideas, then we'll be able\nto continue with our current system\nof collecting affiliation fees\".\nNews team meetings are held on Monday, 1pm in the Felix Office\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nMusic at St Mary's Next Friday sees the second Mary's version of\n\"The Last Night Of The Proms', performed at\nWilson House. This concert, given by the St\nMary's Chamber Orchestra, marks another\nmilestone in the development of music at St\nMary's Hospital in recent years.\nThe 'Proms' is, in fact, the fourth concert\ngiven by this new orchestra consisting entirely\nof players from St Mary's. This in itself is a remarkable achievement; in a college of merely\n600 there is an orchestra of around sixty\nmembers and there are a further forty in the\nchoir.\nMary's, and in particular the umbrella Music\nSociety, is very proud of its musicians. There is\nno doubt that the quality and number of players\nand singers at the Medical School is greater than\never before.\nPerhaps one reason for this is the extremely\nsuccessful music scholarship scheme. Two of\nthe Imperial College music scholarships have\nbeen awarded to Mary's fresher s this year. It\nmakes Mary's the only medical school in Britain\nwith such a system, recognising musicians and\ngiving them an incentive to apply to study there.\nFurthermore, the Music Society offers its own\nmusic exhibition to players already at St Mary's who have dedicated themselves to music and\nshow particular skill or potential.\nAnother factor involved in the extraordinary\ndevelopment of music at St Mary's has been the\nclose link with Imperial College at South\nKensington. The Music Society is one of the few\nsocieties which has embraced the merger and\nused the opportunities provided to improve the\npossibilities of music making. The dialogue\nbetween experts, and wealth of ideas that have\ncrossed the park over the last couple of years,\nhave encouraged and assisted both institutions\nequally. Much of this has been due to the\nforesight of Imperial's Musician-in-Residence,\nRichard Dickins, and the Mary's music\ncommittee, chaired by Tuck-Kay Loke.\nThese contacts between music and musicians\nin Kensington and Paddington will further\ndevelop over the next few months. Miles Scholar\n(Biology 3) will be the soloist in the Mary's 'Last Night At The Proms' next Friday. There\nare more Mary's players in Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra than ever before.\nThe Music Society, though, does not just\nprovide a service to the members of the Medical\nSchool, but the whole of St Mary's Hospital.\nThere are upwards of fifty staff members in the\nsociety and many more attend functions (some\neighty at last term's summer concert). The choir\nperforms at hospital carol services and small\ngroups play for many distinguished events. The\nsociety will be performing at Ealing Hospital\n(part of the Mary's group) later this year, and\nthere are plans for concerts in other hospitals\nwhen practicable.\nThe age-old link between music and\nmedicine has been well documented. The Music\nSociety at Mary's has existed in its present form\nsince 1941, when it had as members such\neminent names as Sir George Pinker and John\nBallantyne (the founder member). Its sixth\ndecade has produced a wealth of talent giving\nthe society a new lease of life, including a restructured committee (now headed by Df\nRodney Rivers). Furthermore, the society now\nseems to become efficient and well managed^\nWe have appointed an auditor and have just set\nup a new fund held in trust for musical\npurchases.\nIndeed, the efficiency and competence of the\nSociety saw its reward in a more than 30%\nincrease in Union Grant for 1993-94. The\nSociety is also ably supported by the bean and\nstaff of the Medical School and hospital.\nThe orchestra is staging a 'Last Night Of The\nProms' for the second consecutive year on\nFriday 12th November. The concert will include\nthe 'Carmen' suite, Saint Saens cello concert a, 'Pomp and Circumstance', 'Jerusalem', 'Rule\nBritannia' and much more. Wc aim to create as\nmuch of the Albert Hall atmosphere as possible,\neven without a dome or 3000 seats!\nIt would be a great pleasure to welcome\nstudents and staff from the South Kensingtoti\nsite to Wilson House (38-76 Sussex Gardens,\nPaddington, W2) for the concert. Tickets will be\navailable at the door before 7.30pm and the price\n(\u00a33.25 student, \u00a35.50 staff) will include free\ninterval drinks. ,\nCome and see for yourselves what Mary's musicians can do!\nA review of Figaro's Wedding is on page 4\n\n"

If you play effortlessly wonderful\nguitar pop, however, you're a pathetic\nanal-retentive with his head stuck up his Big Star\ncollection. Less eloquently, I ask Dave how he\nfeels about being labelled 'unoriginal'.\n\"Well, first we want to make something that\nsounds undeniably good. Then we'll work really\nhard to make that sound our own. I think we're\noriginal in a subtle way. It's not a pure pop thing\nand it's not a straight rock thing - it's kind of a combination of the both. That's where we're\ntrying to be original.\"\n\"Well it's not the stuff of dreams\nWhen you're bursting at the seems\nAnd your mothers face looks worn\nAnd your father talks with scorn.\"\n- Pin Cushion\nAnd it works. Strong songs and melodies\nwith little guitar hitches and spirals, occasionally\nquirky ness in the drum department, all kinds of\nsubjects, all kinds of tunes. Get it straight, this\nisn't another of our weird pieces pushing\nart-wank rock, this is music you'll want playing\non your car radio for that whole two week\nhoneymoon in wherever.\nDave sometimes has problems selling\nhimself. \"It took us a long time to be able to\nadmit that we were good, to say to someone like\nyou guys 'Yeah, we're really good. We practice\nhard, we sing in tune, we write good songs and\nwe kick ass live!'\"\nYeah, live. On stage Gigolo Aunts are a revelation. There's an energy in their set that has\nnot quite made the transition to the recording\nstudio yet. They operate like a single body with\nguitars for arms, drums for legs and, to put the\nmetaphor on the rack, three tongued\nbeach boy esque harmonies for a mouth. There's no friction, only lubrication. You sense they are\npushing each other forward rather then battling\nfor ear play. Phil kneels down at the table and\ntakes up the point.\n\"When you tour a lot, a weird thing starts to\nhappen. When you first start out you're trying\nreally hard to play as tight as possible - to prove\nyou're a tight band...but we've passed that point.\nWe're so tight we can start to get loose again.\"\nHe rumbles on in his low radio-friendly voice\nthat belies his airy vocal sound.\n\"There's a weird telepathy that starts to\nhappen. You know you're not going to mess up\n'cos you've played the song so many times - so\nyou can really start to mess with it.\"\nTintin talks about the Smashing Pumpkins\nresigning themselves to playing large venues due\nto their Weimer Republic-like inflation. Where\ndo the Aunties like to play?\n\"I much prefer small venues,\" says Dave,\nadding, \"I'm a glut ten for instant gratification -it's a wonder I'm not a drug fiend! If the\naudience like you and they're halfway polite\nthen they'll let you know - and if you suck\nthey'll let you know! I hate it when they don't do anything. If we're going down I'd rather they\nthrew shit at us! Wait, don't say that! If they're\ngonna throw something they'd better make it\nlight and fluffy 'cos we're all pansies.\"\nHow was touring with Suede and the\nCranberries? Half an hour must be limiting?\n\"It went really well. For the first song they'd check us out, for the second they'd nod their\nheads and by the seventh song they'd be\nmoshi ng away and stage diving and I'm a sucker\nfor that. I need that because I don't get that\ngratification anywhere else..err..well...\"\nCue massed laughter and rib poking from\nvarious band members, record company people\nand your two favourite m usos. Tintin warms to\nthe theme, drooling. What about rock and roll,\nwhat about groupies?\n\"The evidence is making a hasty escape in\nthe corridor behind you,\" I joke. Dave stutters\nand the record company man tries to blow us off\nthe scent with talk of fan letters. No way - what\nabout the rock and roll trappings!\n\"I wouldn't even call them groupies,\" he\nsays. \"For some reason we seem to appeal to a weird crowd who aren't even cool enough for\nTeenage Fanclub...Maybe we're just too dorky\nto take advantage of the scene or maybe we're\njust too polite...I'm the only one without a girlfriend, let's put it that way.\"\nSo you're never tempted?\n\"No-one's going to fuck up the dynamics of\nthe band. Steve, Phil and Paul all have\ngirlfriends and the last thing they're going to do\nis be disloyal to them because we've known\neach other so long we'd go back and tell them!\"\nOkay, enough said. If we were sad music\nhack types writing for NME in three years...\n\"And the sacred moments\nof silliness are where I find my Heaven,\"\n- Where I Find My Heaven\n\"I'd kick your teeth in!\" laughs Dave. \"Nah,\nyou guys are too smart to be hacks, oh, I don't even want to slag them off anymore. Sorry, what\nwas the question?\"\nHmmm...where do you see yourself being?\n\"I know that somewhere deep inside our\ncollective soul is a classic album waiting to\ncome out. I wan't to make an album so good that\npeople who don't even like us will love that one\nalbum...Pop is disposable in one way but in\nanother is timeless. Like that Nirvana record is\ngoing to sound just as good in twenty years time\nas it does now - but all those bands who came up\nin the wake will be lost.\"\nWe chat about the fame trap (\"We all grew\nup together so none of us could ever develop any\nRock Star traits,\" predicts Dave), the privileged\nfeeling you get seeing a band lose themselves\nlive and the gory disaster that is 'Being Around'\non the new Lemonheads album. Sweet old Tintin\nfalls for a joke about the next album being a triple 'Lord of the Rings' spectacular. The tape\nruns on and we become anxious.\n\"Man, you guys are going to have so much\ntyping to do!\" says Dave. Phil suggests they\ninterview us and Paul the drummer, \"the\nweirdest guy we know\", claims to have added\nmessages to the tape subliminally. Dave\nsuggests:\n\"Just go back and say 'Man they were so\nmean! We went to the flat and it was trashed,\nthere were booze bottles everywhere, they\nkicked our ass, stole our tape recorder and threw\nus down the stairs.'\"\nThe Gigolo Aunts are cool guys, I shook\nhands with their cleaning lady and you may as\nwell start listening to them before your little\nbrother (and your mother) discovers them first.\nThe new album 'Flippin' Out' is available on\nFire Records. See last weeks Felix for a review.\nGigolo Aunts\nPowerhaus\nWe enter a place filled with old people. Why\nare these people old? Because they're in the\nmusic business. Tonight is a night for Gigolo\nAunts to sell themselves. But do they care for\nthat game? The second song is new, so much\nfor promoting their two day old album.\nMaybe the fact that it is an awful pseudo\nmetal screech is even more endearing. The\nbeginning of the set is shaky.\nThe port en ce of things to come strangely\nis another new track. The usual inter song politeness of the American band is warmly\nbroken. Another new penning is dedicated to\na music journalist. Weird, positiv it y. The\nGigolo Aunts are facing both ways in the\nmedia debate and starting to tap into our\nhearts. The song is more fragile than you\nexpect and then the whole live experience\nstarts to move. Recorded music is alright but\nonly live has the ability for become our\nreality.\nSlowly the evening goes, a mist clears.\nThe singles 'Cope' and 'Gun' are rolled out\nfor the assembled. By this time a well oiled\nmachine is playing for fun and enjoying it.\nHow many times have songs been dedicated\nto our \"favorite Scandavian band\" Aha? It\nhappened.\nThe first ending is carried out with\n'Bloom' as solid as a day is long. An encore\nis easily provoked and the special guest is on\nstage. 'Carlos Santana' stands without bushy\nmoustache. Strange, he looks like Suede's Bernard. The NME photo man certainly thinks\nso as more rolls of film are used during the\nnext one song 'Tomorrow never comes' (the\nBeatles played with a Doorish three guitar\nlead) than he's used in the previous ten days.\nThe rolling encores continue Suedeless and\nthe show is on.\nThe BMX Bandit's 'Serious Drugs' is soft\nand the ending is an effortlessly silly Smiths\n'Ask'. That we now possess ear splitting grins\nis endemic. Pose a question about fame and\nwe can face both ways. Their music reached a dull cavity and sparked, and that's enough\ngreatness. Let them take the stage and run.\nTintin\nThe winner of the Anthrax competition is on the letters pages\n\n"

    "content": "18 Clubs and Societies\nFilmSoc's Next The International Tamil Society\nFilm Showings\nTomorrow night, FilmSoc gives you the chance\nto see the cult classic National Lampoon's Animal House. This film contains what is\npossibly the most mindless violence ever seen in\nthe cinema, carried out mainly by the late-great\nJohn Belushi. This is the film where the messiah\nof comedy ejaculates the contents of his mouth\n(a cream bun) over fellow students, proclaiming\nthat he is a zit. The lunacy begins at 1 l pm. On Sunday, FilmSoc presents a film slated\nby the critics which was supposed to be one of\nthe summer 'biggies'. Nevertheless, Last Action\nHero is an excellent piss-take, with Arnie\nparodying himself in his previous films. If you\nthought it was odd that Mel Gibson played\nHamlet, see Schwarzenegger doing the very\nsame thing, but with the usual heavy artillery.\nThe programme begins at 8pm and is presented\nin wall to wall, ceiling to floor cinema scope. Finally, Thursday night is the FilmSoc\npresentation for Rag. Much Ado About Nothing\nis Brannagh's latest offering and one certainly\nnot to be missed. The print of the film has been\ndonated by Mr Trevor Green, Managing\nDirector of Entertainment Film Distributors.\nSome proceeds will also be donated to the\ncinema and television Benevolence Fund - an\norganisation dedicated to providing care for\nveterans of the film industry.\nOne final note, ICU Cinema may not be the\nEmpire Leicester Square, but it's certainly\ncheaper. You can also drink in the auditorium,\nand the back five rows are for those of you who\ncan't last two and a half hours without a fag.\nThe newly formed International Tamil Society is\nincreasingly showing signs of becoming one of\nthe most successful clubs this term. The society\nwas set up to unify all Tamils who come from a variety of different countries. However, we are\nalso strongly encouraging students of any ethnic\nbackground to participate in our activities.\nOriginally from Southern India, Tamils are\nnow mostly concentrated in the southern-most\nthird of India, where Tamil is the official\nlanguage of the state of Tamil Nadu, and in the\nnorthern tip of Sri Lanka. Other Tamil speakers\nreside in Malaysia, Burma, Indonesia, Vietnam,\nEast Africa, South Africa, Guyana and islands in\nthe Indian Ocean, the South Pacific and the\nCaribbean.\nThe Tamil area in India is the centre of\ntraditional Hinduism. Apart from the literature\nwritten in classical Sanskrit, Tamil is the oldest\nliterature in India, where inscriptions date back\nto the 3rd century BC, and is one of the oldest\nspoken languages in the world today.\nThe Tamils in Sri Lanka today are of various\ngroups and castes. The so called Ceylon Tamil,\ncomprising about half of them, are concentrated\nin the northern part of the island. In the 1980s, growing tensions between the Ceylon Tamils\nand the Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka, due\ndiscrimination against Tamils prompted hostility\nagainst the central government in hopes of\ncreating an autonomous Tamil homeland for\nthemselves in the northern and eastern part of\nSri Lanka.\nThis tension caused unnecessary controversy\nand dispute last term from certain Overseas\nSocieties in setting up this club. After numerous\ndebates and a rejection from the Overseas\nStudents Committee, the society was finally\nformed under the Social Clubs Committee. We\nhope we can put all this behind us and start\nafresh. We enjoyed our first outing to Queens\nIce Skating Rink and have a heavy schedule of\nevents coming up. Our major event this term is a cultural evening of dance and music from India\nand Sri Lanka to held in early December.\nTo join please drop in on Wednesday, l pm in\nroom 403a, Elec Eng dept or leave a note in our\npigeonhole in the Union Office.\nLadies Win Boat Race\nMatch Score: Goldsmith's2, IC 0\nFor once, the Ladies Football team were early\nfor the train but we still didn't make it there in\ntime for a pre-match pint.\nPaula's first half injury left us with no\nsubstitutes and no natural forwards. Some\nspectacular defending by Julianna (the player of\nthe match) meant that we were only down 1-0 at\nhalf time.\nThe second half saw an ill timed injury to\nChris (variation on a theme - ribs this time). We\ndidn't manage to equalise despite all our efforts.\nAnother injury led to yet another restructuring of\nthe defence, confusion and another goal.\nBut at the end of the day, the team which\nscores the most goals wins (and that wasn't us).\nHowever, true to form, we easily won the seven-a side boat race afterwards!\nIC Finance Society\nFinancial Journalism Competition held in association with\nThe Financial Times\n\u00a3 7 5 cash\ncould be yours. How ? Write down your thoughts in response to the question:\n\"What are the implications for Europe of the\ncurrency crisis in the financial markets?\"\nThere are runners-up prizes of \u00a350 and \u00a325 and you could have your article\npublished in the January issue of CAPITAL, the magazine of the FinanceSociety.\nThe winning articles will be chosen by a selection of committee members and journalists\nfrom the FT.

    "content": "16 Reviews\nWi.\nBit 111\n111\nThe Oldest Snowman In\nThe World\nby Eric Jones\nClaims to be a 'By Myself book, so suitable for\nbeginner readers. I took the words to heart and\nbegan to read the book by myself. This is a must\nfor all those people who want to keep their\nsnowmen forever. There are many useful\nsuggestions in the book as the brother-sister\nteam struggle to maintain their snowman\nthrough the spring, summer and autumn terms.\nEric Jones' literary limits are exposed with the\nabundant use of annoying phrases like \"ITl-get-my-own-back-expression\", \"sulky-expression\",\n\"cunning and thinking-hard expressions\".\nExactly how a beginner reader is supposed to\nrecognise these is beyond my mental scope.\nAfter all, I am a beginner reader myself, so I should know (or not as the case may be).\nThere are three morals to the story:\n1. Never be nice to a snowman because he\ndoesn't know how to appreciate anything (a bit\nlike most men really).\n2. Never feed a snowman orange ice-lollies\n3. Send them back to where they came from.\nIf you think this has a ring of racism in it, it's only you responding to the recent surge in\nracial-hatred world-wide.\nConclusion: At \u00a32.50 it's good value for\nmoney, if only to use the handy hints for making\nthis year's snowman last 'til next year.\nZiegler\nPublished by: Young Corgi\nPrice: \u00a32.50\nTo Be Reviewed Soon:\nAs well as Johnny And The Dead, two other Terry Pratchett books have\njust been published: The Light Fantastic (a graphic novel) and Lords And\nLadies, another novel of the Discworld series.\nJohnny And\nThe Dead\nby Terry Pratchett\nJohnny And The Dead is a tale of a young boy,\nJohnny, who meets a few 'post-life' citizens,\ninhabitants of his local cemetery. With the help\nof a few strangely-named friends (Big Mac,\nWobber and Yo-less), he decides to fight to stop\nthe cemetery being built upon. In doing so, he\ngives the dead a new lease of life.\nIt is not a bad example of Terry Pratchett's unique writing style, but it is first and foremost\na book aimed at children in their early teens, (it\nwas awarded the Best Children's Book Of The\nYear by the Writer's Guild).\nThus, if you are looking for a book that\nexcites the senses, grips you in unusual places\nand leaves you exhausted, this is not the one for\nyou. The plot is as easy to follow as a caterpillar\nmunching its way, slowly, through a stick of\nbroccoli. The race y style exhibited in Pratchett's Discworld series is sadly lacking. This is thus\nbest left to children, unless caterpillar watching\nis a hobby that you find intriguing.\nGinster\nPublished by: Doubleday/Corgi\nPrice: \u00a39.99 (Hardback)\nAiJ.

    "content": "Music Special\n1\n1\n1 \u2022 1 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022''\nMadder Rose\n& Nightblooms\nThe Garage\nHolland is flat. Fact. Denied vertical diversity\nthe creative Dutchman must go faster or slower.\nMaster tempo and then, if she's an artist, build\naround it a beautiful thing. Nightblooms zip\nalong then stop, smile and slide back into their\nown musical bouquet. A bouquet encompassing\nall the flowers in the alternative border.\nThe lead guitarist is Rocky Horror meets the\nRock Circus. The drummer stamps on the tunes,\ndrives them - he's not here to nod heads but to\nembolden hearts. On bass we have an example\nof Amsterdam's finest crust, a tiny dread-mop\nwith a voice like nicotine toned glass. The lead\nsinger, Esther, pure stereotype, milk-white blood\nblushed skin topped with a blonde frizz, her\nvocals high and sparkling like a crystal diadem.\nTogether they produce a sound that's almost\nindefinable. Reference points would be the\nprecise gay effervescence of the early Cocteau\nTwins but coupled with duelling vocal\nharmonies (even at times two simultaneous\nsongs), complementing then offsetting each\nother in a beguiling lyrical dance. The music\nisn't quite grunge or standard indie-fare, it's led\na step further down that moonlit garden path.\nThe Nightblooms - swiped straight from the streets of Amsterdam\nChoppy guitars that divide a three minute popish song into three one minute melodies.\nThinking tulips in spite of myself - the\nelusive black buds of course. Nightblooms.\nDividing a night in two.\nFrom New Amsterdam to New York\nhappened about a hundred years ago and now\nMadder Rose are the New Yorkers of the here.\nHeck they even hung with Andy Warhol before\nhe was no more. I hope they'll get more than\ntheir allotted fifteen minutes because tonight, at\nleast they're good; verging better.\nBilly's ill, let's pray for Billy to make it\nthrough the set. Billy plays the guitar. Billy\ndoesn't look at the crowd. Billy plays his game.\nMary Lorson's on stage. Long, straight down\nIntastella &\nShampoo\nULU\nEngine Alley open this triple bill at the 'grand'\nreopening of UL U. Except for a few colourful\nindividuals, the audience seem a little unsure of\nhow to react to this Irish band. Either it's the\nusual cynicism to the bottom-of-the-bill band, or\nmore likely because they appear to be an\nincredible mismatch of characters. To elucidate\nthis, the singer looks like Gary Numan, the\nguitarist like Gary Moore, the drummer like\nAlison Crane and the violinist like he's just\nwalked out of the Royal Festival Hall. Phew.\nAnd to make it even more confusing, they sound\nlike Miss World and Suede. (Yes, them.) Back\nto reality, they are good live.\nShampoo are two girls, Jacqui (19) and\nCarrie (17), who dress up in camp clothes and\nwouldn't look out of place in 'Bugsy Malone.'\nThey are the antithesis to ageing male m usos but\nthe post-modern irony to it all is that the backing\nband contain the aforementioned, except they're\n'mates' and perhaps not that old. They actually\nsound like the backing chorus on 'The Wall'\n(the \"we don't need no education\" bit) and with\nsong titles like 'Bouffant Headbutt' you have to\nlike them.\nSimilar parallels can be drawn to Shonen\nKnife with their sweet aesthetics, but the\ndifference here is that this lot brandish a cod\nconfrontational stance and proceed to charm us\nout of our socks with faux precocity. Recent\ninterviews in the music press suggest a pair of\nvacuous individuals who were nothing but pout\nand peroxide, but underneath the sch moo zy veneer lie image terrorists intent on hijacking\nour minds. A definite 90s band: the corollary to\nthe 'we don't care how we look' ethos which as\nyou know, became haute couture. Oh the irony.\nFinally Intastella. With about eight people on\nstage and a lone female grabbing the centre and\nmost of the male audience's attention, they play.\nEasily more accessible than the previous bands,\nand more popular, but frankly I couldn't take\nmore than ten minutes and just had to leave.\nIntastella try to reach for the stars but not\nsurprisingly end up with a handful of dusty\ncobwebs. Tonight was Shampoo's night, closely\nfollowed by Engine Alley.\nCamille\nhair framing her face. She has the bum job,\ngetting to sing Billy's neurotic a. She does it as a native. Malaise is sweet when you get to project\nwhat's not your own.\nThe tribute to Warhol, 'Beautiful John' gets\nearly exposure but 'Baby Gets High' is the start\nof their glory. A previously ethereal song\nbecomes a lithe, rippling beast. Caught between\nhigh strung vocals and plain noisy guitars,\nMadder Rose find their feet and don't break for\nthe next forty minutes. It's continuous wonder.\nTheir only misnomer is the encore. It leaks\nrhythm and flopped. Well with two drummers,\ndid they think they were Pavement? Still, we left\nin peace, happy to be alive.\nNB - Owain MR - Tintin\nCarter USM\nBrixton Academy\nThe first act of the night was Blade, a politically correct rapper. There was some\ntrouble last time Blade supported Carter, so it\nwas a brave gesture for them to give him\nanother go. A risk I think was well worth it.\nMega City Four were obviously not\nimpressed by the huge Brixton Academy. The\nmasses of fans shouting at them were\ndisappointed: \"You're so far away we can't hear\nyou.\" This didn't seem to stop the band playing\nan excellent set, and I certainly had fun.\nThen, Carter. The lights, the cameras, and\nthe action (the be ered up skinhead brigade had\narrived from the bar). All the same, no-one was\ngoing to spoil this night. Despite Jim-Bob's admitted hang-over, he was on form today, and\nnot even long trousers had dulled Fruitbat'sperm a grin. Accompanied by mountains of flash\nequipment, they played songs spanning from\n101-Damnations, right up to the latest single,\n'Lean On Me, I Won't Fall Over'. (And believe\nme, I only pi ug the good ones.) A good one.\nTimsi\nA review of The Piano is on page 14\n\n"

    "content": "Music Special\n; ;;V:;.:: v;L r:J>''' villi ij l Q)m lM Spinanes\nManos\nMazzy Star\nS0 Tonight That I Might See\nThe Spinanes are a two piece band guitar,\ndrums, female vocals from Portland, Oregon,\nand they are on Sub Pop. But they are not the\nusual Sub Pop fare. The opening track on\nManos, 'Entire', makes this clear from the very\nstart. For what other bands on Sub Pop play\ngentle, acoustic music which tensely builds up\ninto the gentlest most soothing chorus\nimaginable? And indeed, what other Sub Pop\nband has no bass guitar?\nOn first hearing, though, it is easy to put\n'Entire' down as an anomaly, because the next\nsong rocks along in typical indie fashion,\nsounding more like Pond or Sprinkler (poppy\ngrunge bands) than 10,000 Maniacs. But it\nwould be wrong to do so while the rest of the\nalbum falls between these two in terms of\nsound. The actual songs lean more towards the\nbeauty of 'Entire' than the drudgery of 'Noel,\nJonah And Me', the second track. The rhythms\nwriggle and the melodies snake their way into\nyour head and won't go away. There are\nwonderful moments on 'Dangle' when\nRebecca's voice falls between notes like Natalie\nMerchant's used to, which makes it impossible\nto dislike this record.\nThis is a well written album of pop songs,\nwhich has a place in the collection of anyone\nwho likes Suzanne Vega or 10,000 Maniacs, or\nindeed anyone else. (7)\nGuy\nReleased on (take a wild guess) Sub Pop\nMazzy Star are the kind of band who everyone\nseem to pin their prose on. They could be the\nmoon hanging over the grave of rock and roll.\nThat they are manics on the depressive front is\ntaken as par for the road they walk.\nCompared to their debut 'She Hangs\nBrightly', the new album is certainly what we\ncould label darker, but whether it is depressive\nI'm not sure. At the heart of the songs is a cold\nsolemnity which reminds you of embracing\nmarble. Still, that's just the background of their\nstyle. Only on the cavernous 'Mary Of Silence'\nand 'Into Dust' do the icy fingers of sparseness\nreally get a grip. The surprise is that in their own\nway, Mazzy Star do pick up their skirt and have\na good time. 'Bells Ring' bathes in warm\necstatic guitar and 'Blue Light' is a dusk song\nwith its lazy half whispered vocals. The title\ntrack is also the last. Comparisons are maybe a necessary evil for a reviewer and I was reminded\nof the Velvet's 'Venus In Furs.' Which is not to\nsay that the two sound the same, rather there was\nthe same latent malevolence at work. The\nweird ing cry of a funeral march is haunting. It\ncan be a sad thing but Mazzy Star do allow us to\nfind comfort in a world which we know is\ng looming. Moonlight is still for the lunatics. (7)\nTintin\nReleased on Capitol\n\u2022\nLemonheads\nCome On Feel The\nLemonheads\nI adore this band. For weeks I'd cut into Virgin\non my way home and hog the listening post,\nfalling in love to 'It's A Shame About Ray'. It\nwas such a beautiful story, pure pop-vignettes\nthat inconspicuously became essential and\ncontinued to strum on throughout summer. I fell\nin love to these tunes.\nIt's a new season and the material previewed\nat Glastonbury and Reading has come home.\nWill they be wearing out the headphones at the\nMegastore? I don't think so. Anyone who's going to tune into this band has heard them by\nnow - as the hype machine's been cranked up\nthey've lost their quirky niche. Also, these\nsongs, however cool, don't define the band.\nThey've been defined by them.\nThe album opens with Evan grinning\ngoo fully from under a ten gallon. \"The Great Big\nNo' springs from the great wide open whilst\n'Into Your Arms' is folk y rock at it's finest. On\nfirst listening, it's all Country and Western up\nuntil 'Big Gay Heart'. That the initial impression\nis ultimately mistaken is all the more intriguing.\nWhere's the grunge? It's there but you don't see\nthe wood for the cactus. Evan's soppy tirade\nagainst gay bashing is twanged and 'yaw led' to\nthe max. The Boston Boy's gone native.\nThen comes 'Style', the roughest scrawl they\ncan add to the current penchant for suicide note\nrock (see Cobain K. and Corgan B.). \"Don't wanna get high/but I don't wanna not get\nhigh...don't wanna knock things down/so I'm not gonna not get high.\" It thumps along the way\n' Love y' did, followed speedily by 'Rest\nAssured' - guaranteed to fill the mosh with a school-load of sweaty bodies. So Evan didn't abandon his roots, suddenly 'Down About It' is\nrecognised as the choppy little gem it is.\nSide B shouldn't arrive, this album was cut\nfor CD and the break isn'ta natural one. 'Dawn\nCan't Decide' is an odd little number with a whirring chorus that fills the whole three\nminutes. The Beach Boys aura is enhanced when\nDando leaves Juliana Hatfield and her girl ie squeaky vocals to hold hands with Belinda\nCarlisle (and her squeaky vocals) on 'I 'll Do It\nAnyway'. How does he get away with it?\nBecause these are marvellous pop songs!\nOkay, there are some flops - a gratuitous 'Style'\nreprise does Evan's voice no favours by bringing\nin soulful Rick James and a drugged down\ntempo. And 'Being Around' has been absolutely\nmassacred. With just him and his guitar he was\nsickly sweet, now he induces sickness beyond\nthe floodlights. The extra 'secret' tracks are\nendless and won't seem so irksome on a CD\narmed with a skip button. But these are slight\nquibbles.\nTo those who know the Lemonheads, we\nhave at least ten new favourites for our\ncollection of favourites. The rest may like this\nalbum, but I think there will be a feeling of\nrandomness, of grabbing ten good titles from the\nbargain bucket. Such is the price of arriving late\nat the party.

    "content": "20 Feature\nJimeoin\nTony Grew interviews the Irishman who took Australia by storm.\nComedy can be a dod gy business. I mean, there\nare certain sad individuals out there who pay\nmoney to see Ben Elton, the king of crap. So you\nhave to be really careful when recommending\ncomedians; you may be sitting there rapidly\nlosing your bladder control, but this does not\nnecessarily mean anyone else is. Still, Jimeoin is\ntruly hilarious, and if you don't think so, I have\nnothing further to say to you, except that you too\ncan have the magic of Bob Monkhouse in your\nvery own sad home, on video from any bad\nretailer.\nBorn and brought up in Northern Ireland,\nyoung Jim moved to London and worked on the\nbuilding sites, eventually emigrating to\nAustralia. \"Moving to Australia is always a conscious decision. You don't just wake up there\none morning with a hangover.\" He says his\nreasons for going were simple: \"I was bored\nwith London; I'd worked there for four years\nand was sick of it.\" Yet he didn't think of\ncomedy as a profession \"until I started getting\npaid for my gigs\". Evidently he was a success;\nhe even stars as a lovable lackey in a period\nsitcom, and will soon start his own series.\nWhat is more remarkable about all of this is\nthe content of his act. It never makes reference\nto the violence in Ireland, nor does it descend\ninto the more g yna ecological excesses of some\npeople we could mention. His explanation is\ndisarming ly simple. \"You've always got to do\nsomething other than the obvious. My accent\nwas useful as a sort of calling card, though\npeople tended to treat me as a clich6 d Irishman.\nOf course English and Irish people would do the\nexact same thing to an Australian.\" But their\nassumptions about Ireland amused him: \"They\nthink it's like potatoes all over the floor,\neverything's green and top of the morning to you\nand all that!\"\nHe has also been very well received in the\nStates, with several TV appearances, though he\nwas not impressed with the standard of comedy\nhe found there. \"I don't find them funny in the\nslightest - pathetic. I honestly prefer stand-up; by\nthe time you get on TV and go through the\nprocedure and haggle with various producers\nyou can't be yourself.\"\nHopefully the audience in London will be\nmore sophisticated. Among his favourite\ncomedians, he lists Billy Connolly and Eddie\nIzzard \"I think he's really talented\". He is also\nvery fond of Sean Hughes, who he supported in\nDublin earlier in the year. \"He's a very deep and\nmeaningful person,\" he deadpans.\nJimeoin's shows at the Edinburgh Festival\nwere all sold out, and Hat Trick productions are\nsponsoring his current 35 date tour. He will be at\nthe Queen's Theatre (Shaftesbury Avenue) on\n7th November and there are still some tickets\nleft. He is definitely one to watch and next time\nhe plays London you'll probably need a second\noverdraft to buy a ticket.

    "content": "Reviews 15\nMedea\n\"/ know what it is I intend to do.\nThe rage of my heart is stronger than my reason.\nThat is the cause of all man's foulest crimes \"\nA tragedy by the 5th Century BC dramatist and\npoet Euripides, Medea is the story of a woman's revenge on her fate. Medea, daughter of the\nKing of Colchis, unflinchingly inflicts a terrible\nrevenge on her husband, Jason, who has deserted\nher. Murdering and disowning her family to help\nJason during the ten years of their marriage, she\nis finally deserted by him for the King of\nCorinth's daughter.\nFriendless and stateless and forced into exile\nonce again, she determines to ruin Jason and,\nthrough sorcery, murder his new bride in\ndefiance of her fate. She knows that the price of\nher revenge means that she must kill her own\nchildren.\nThis is another accomplished work from\nJonathan Kent, artistic director of the Almeida\nTheatre, where Medea first opened last year.\nDiana Rigg plays the complex, possessed\nMedea, and is as unforgiving and immovable as\nonly the gods can be, but she cannot undo her\nchosen fate.\nThere is not a wasted line in the dialogue of\nthis new translation by Alistair Elliot. Rigg's majestic portrayal of Medea as a woman with a fine intelligence and deadly reasoning is\nchilling. Tim Woodward plays a rather\nambitious and shallow Jason, un believing of the\nprice his wife is willing to pay for her survival.\nThe cruelty of her revenge is that she intends\nhim to survive.\nThe chorus of the women of Corinth, dressed\nin black as modern, middle-aged Greek women,\nprovides not only the narrative but also gives a voice to our own reactions. The mix of\ncontemporary costume style with the historically\ncorrect was rather distracting; Medea wore a costume close to the ancient Greek style, but\nKing Creon, played by John Turner, wore a suit\nsomewhere from Chicago in the 1920s and a very substantial black mohair overcoat.\nThe set, a corner of an inner courtyard with\nhigh walls made of metal panels roughly painted\nin terracotta, are as stark and unforgiving as\nMedea herself. In one of two magnificent\nscenes, the structure falls like the walls of\nJericho as Medea reveals herself to Jason in a blood-soaked gown, hands covered in the still\nviscous blood of their murdered sons. As Medea\nregards him from above, her in dom it ability and\nthe cancer of her corrupted power have strangely\ntriumphed over her fate, destroying all she has\nloved and valued. If Medea does not win our\nunderstanding, she certainly holds a fascination.\nAriana Sen\nWyndham's Theatre, Charing Cross Rd. 071 867\n1116. Tube: Leicester Sq. Tickets \u00a39 - \u00a321.\nmw K Travesties\nThis is not a play to go to without some\npreparation. Unless you have an in depth\nknowledge of Zurich during the first world war,\nthe dada movement, and the life and times of\nLenin, James Joyce and Tristan Tzara (or if you\nbought and digested the \u00a31.80 programme\nbefore the performance) you will be left\nwondering why you spent money on the tickets\nrather than enjoying an evening pondering 'Even\nFurther Quantum Mechanics' and the 20 Pot\nNoodles which the ticket price would have\nbought you (22 if you include the price of the\nprogramme).\nA retired, sartorially obsessed, consular\nofficial is your guide for the evening and regales\nthe audience with witty repartee regarding the\nLenin and Joyce he knew while taking part in a production of the Importance Of Being Earnest\nand attempting to seduce the local librarian. Or\nat least I assume that's what the plot was. This\ntwo and a half hour marathon from the Royal\nShakespeare Company had half of the audience\nrolling in the aisles while the other half looked\npolitely puzzled. It did become less tedious after\nthe much needed fifteen minute interval, even\nenjoyable (perhaps because it gave this 'classical\neducationally challenged' reviewer a chance to\nswot the programme) but I left the theatre\nfeeling somewhat exhausted and non- plus sed. There are some memorable events which\nmake this performance enjoyable for the less\nscholarly and at \u00a36 a ticket during the upcoming\nArmchair Proms week (see below) it is less\npainful than forking out the full \u00a320.\nHighlights? The departure of Lenin from the\nstation is quite good as is the librarians\nstriptease...\nMJ\nIn rep at RSC Barbican Theatre, Barbican, EC2\n071 638 8891. Tickets: standby \u00a38/\u00a36.50\nimmediately before performance\nArmchair Proms From 8th13 th November, The Royal Shakespeare Company\nat the Barbican Theatre are offering the best seats for three\nproductions for only \u00a36 per ticket (normally \u00a321.50).\nA special Box Office by the Silk Street theatre entrance will\nopen at 8.30am on the day of the performance to sell the tickets.\nTravesties The Winter's Tale\nTamburlaine the Great\nAn Absence Of\nWar\nDavid Hare was allowed to go 'behind the\nscenes' of the Labour Party during the last\ngeneral election. The result is a comical and also\ndeadly serious play that takes a look at our\npolitical system without going into too much\ndetail so as to confuse the politically illiterate.\nJohn Thaw never quite succeeds in shaking\noff the robes of Inspector Morse, but\nnevertheless portrays the typical Labour leader\n(if there is such a thing) with pin point accuracy.\nHe gives an honest and friendly feel to his role\nwhich, in politics, is a hard thing to do and on\nthe stage it is even harder.\nThe play proceeds to its sad and inevitable\nconclusion with a lively pace that keeps the\nhumour very much alive without any sacrifice\non content or script. But David Hare might have\nbitten off more than he can chew. The political\nsystem is certainly the biggest and most\ncomplex of all the systems that David Hare has\ntackled or attempted to tackle, and he deserves\nan award for such an attempt, despite the fact\nthat not enough was squeezed in.\nIt has more content than Murmuring Judges,\nbut not as much as Racing Demon. I would see\nthis play to hear a lot of political jokes and also\nto see John Thaw live.\nHarry\nNational Theatre, Olivier, South Bank, SE1. 071\n928 2252. Tickets: \u00a38.50-\u00a321.00.

    "content": "Reviews\nBarbarina (Nerys Jones) and Cherubino (Ethna Robinson) in a scene from Figaro's Wedding\nTwo comic operas featuring the same characters\nfrom the same company, I decided to review the\ntwo together.\nThe Barber Of Seville is the first of these two\nto see if you intend to see them both. One of\nRossini's classic operas, it tells the tale of a young Count and his attempts to woo and wed\nthe beautiful Rosina. Dr. Bartolo, Rosina's guardian, has other ideas and is set on marrying\nRosina himself to get his hands on her not\ninconsiderable fortune.\nCount Almaviva decides to enlist the help of\nFigaro, the Barber of Seville come matchmaker\nand many cunning and amusing plans are\nwrought to confuse and delude Dr Bartolo. A further complication is thrown in when the\nCount decides that he wants Rosina to fall in\nlove with him before she knows who he really is.\nTwo hours of frolics ensue with top marks going\nto Paul Nilon and Andrew Shore for their\nhilarious performances as Count Almaviva and\nDr Bartolo.\nThis revival of The Barber is all you would\nexpect from one of our top opera companies.\nThe sets are perfect, and the mood was apt. The\naudience came about as close to rolling in the\naisles as could be expected of an opera audience\nand I thoroughly enjoyed the whole production.\nTwo weeks later and back I was at the\nLondon Coliseum to see the next installment,\nMozart's Figaro's Wedding. Set three years after\nThe Barber Of Seville, Figaro is now working as\nCount Almaviva's manservant and is all set to\nmarry Countess Rosina's maid, Susanna.\nOut to thwart their plans, though, is\nMarcellina, a lady from whom Figaro borrowed\na sum of money on the agreement that he would\nmarry her if he failed to repay the debt. This he\nis intending to do with the dowry the Count is\ngiving to Susanna for her wedding. The Count is\nhowever regretting his generosity as he has\ndecided that he quite fancies Susanna himself.\nFurther, he is trying to reinstate an old\ntradition which he abolished which would have\ngiven him the right to an assignation with\nSusanna as the provider of her dowry. Dr\nBartolo is helping both the Count and\nMarcellina, hoping to revenge himself on Figaro\nfor helping Count Almaviva steal his Rosina.\nTo aid in all the confusion and intrigue\nCherubino, a young would-be Cassanova, is in\nlove with the Countess, Susanna and just about\nevery other female in the cast. Many a merry\ndance is led by everyone and you wonder if\nFigaro isn't just a bit too clever by half.\nAnyway, all's well that ends well, as this\ninevitably does.\nAgain the performances are good, although\nthe casting wasn't as good as for The Barber and\nthe sets are extremely garish, each of the four\nacts in a different colour as the scenes change.\nSusanna and Cherubino (Cathryn Pope and\nEthna Robinson) came across the best in my\nbooks, putting plenty of life into their characters.\nOf the two I would say that The Barber Of\nSeville was the better, and not just because I prefer Rossini to Mozart; funnier, more lively,\nbetter produced.\nThat said, both operas are well worth seeing\nand if you're a bit hesitant, both operas are in\nEnglish and quite understandable, so you will\nget all the jokes!\nFOB London Coliseum, St Martin's Lane, WC2N, 071\n836 3161. Student stand-by \u00a314.50 3hrs before\nperformance (1 per person).\nFigaro's Wedding: Wed, Thu 7pm, Sat 6pm The Barber Of Seville: Tue, Fri 7.30pm Medea, at the Wyndam's Theatre, is reviewed on page 15\n\n"

    "content": "14 Reviews\nThe Piano\nStarring: Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill\nDirector: Jane Campion\nThe Piano is Jane Campion's first film since the\nmulti-award winning 'An Angel At My Table'.\nIt is a unique portrait of life and love in the 19th century. Borrowing aspects from the kind of\nromance that Emily Bronte portrayed in\n'Wuthering Heights', it is set at a time when\npeople were less bombarded with media images\nof sex and courtship and relied more on their\nown instinct.\nHunter plays a mute Scottish woman, Ada,\nwho is dispatched to an arranged marriage on the\nother side of the world. Along with her go her\ntwo most precious possessions, her daughter\n(Anna Paqin) and her piano. When her husband\nStewart (Sam Neill) refuses to transport the\npiano inland, Ada turns, in desperation, to the\nbrutish Baines (Harvey Keitel) who rescues the\npiano but will only return the instrument if Ada\npays him in sexual favours.\nCampion's direction gives the movie a wonderful dream-like quality. This contrasts\nsharply with the harshness of the New Zealand\nforests. The physical relationship between\nIf\nobjects and people is heightened by Ada's muteness. There is no time for bullshit or small\ntalk. The relationship that develops between Ada\nand Baines is purely instinctive and physical. It's not the traditional view of romance that\nHollywood gives us. This romance is more harsh\nand extreme, more a gothic exploration of the\nromantic impulse.\nAda can only express herself through her\npiano, and her haunting melodies resonate\nthrough the primordial forests giving a ghostly\nfeel to the film.\nThe sexual tension between the characters is\nIIIlllll'lIl\nThis week sees the start of the 37th London Film\nFestival which. It opened last night with the\npreview of the new Merchant-Ivory picture \"The\nRemains Of The Day' based on the Booker prize\nwinning novel by Kazuo Ishiguro and starring\nAnthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.\nThe Festival has a huge range of films from\nall over the world. Many new blockbusters are\npreviewed but this is also the chance to see some\nof the more obscure films not generally released.\nHighlights of films include Robert de Niro's directorial debut in ' A Bronx Tale' and Robert\nAltmans' critically acclaimed 'Short Cuts'\n(reviewed in Felix two weeks ago).\nDetails of screenings and bookings are\navailable from the London Film Festival box\noffice (071 928 3232) or come into Felix if you\nwant to review any of the Film Festival\nscreenings.\nKamran\nThe White Angel by Chris Jones and Genevieve Jolliffe\nYou might think that this is just another film\nabout a serial killer. However, this time it is a British serial killer, an apparently very harmless\nand well mannered dentist who is intrigued by\nthe fact that there never has been a female serial\nkiller.\nLeslie Steckler (Peter Firth) rents a room\nfrom Ellen Carter (Harriet Robinson) for, as he\nsays, only a limited period of time, until he has\nfound something more suitable. His landlady is\nan award winning writer in the field of serial\nkilling. However, her writing has suffered since,\nshortly after her success, her husband\ndisappeared.\nA body was never found, but Carter is hunted\nby Inspector Taylor (Don Henderson) who is\nconvinced that she murdered her husband.\nThings get more complicated after Steckler\nsearched Carter's room and Carter has searched\nSteckler's room and both have acquired\nevidence that the other has some darker secrets.\nI refuse to reveal more of the plot. Instead, go\nand see it for yourself. This is a gripping ly well\nmade independent film and might well be a runner after being released in February or March\nnext year. There is some blood spilt but\ngenerally Jones and Jolliffe rely less on ketchup\neffects and more on skill. Hence, even though\nthis is a real thriller it is also for people who\ndemand more of a film than just guns and blood.\nYou will sit on the edge of your seat, anyway.\nKristine\nextreme and this is interposed with scenes that\nare extremely funny. Hunter plays her part\nbeautifully, never uttering a word, but\nexpressing herself through her piano and her\nface. Harvey Keitel plays a role a million miles\naway from Reservoir Dogs but he is refreshingly\nraw and magnificent as the illiterate Baines. As\nfor Sam Neill, he's still in a forest but there are\ndifferent kinds of dinosaurs troubling him now.\nThis film is Campion at her best, it is\nunpretentious and un contrived. It must be seen.\nKamran Malik\n\u2022 1mm \u2022 ! \u2022 \u2022 \u00a3 1 ^ ^ ^ B Dave\nStarring: Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver\nDirector: Ivan Reitman\nKevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, lookalike of the\n'current' American president, who finds himself\nrequisitioned by the White House when the real\ntop dog suffers an incapacitating stroke while\n'working' late from Capitol Hill (i.e. shagging his\nsecretary).\nOh, isn't power corrupting? One minute a contended puppet on a string, Dave decides to save\nhis country, partly because he fancies Sigourney\nand partly because he's a swell guy. He seizes\ncontrol in a way that no politician ever has.\nThis film suffers from three main flaws. Firstly,\n'Audience Superiority Syndrome'. The main\nentertainment is allegedly provided by watching\npeople gasp at how much Kevin Kline looks like\nKevin Kline. Comprende?\nSecond up we have 'Collapsed Chronology\nSyndrome'. This occurs when the writer is unable\nto convince us of the characters motivation, so\nseveral speedy symbols are employed, such as\ntelling his bodyguard to wear a jumper so the\nbodyguard would die for him. He smiles on TV, so\nthe country's in love with him.\nThe third flaw? This comedy just isn't funny.\n(But the Oliver Stone conspiracy cameo is okay.)\nOwain\nThe 37th London Film Festival runs from 4th to 21st November\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 17\nA Storming All-Nighter Event!\nLast Friday, City & Guilds Motor Club held the\n'Freshers' Rally', a storming all-night er event\nthrough the country lanes of Oxfordshire,\nBerkshire and Hampshire. The first surprise\ncame when police informed us that the area was\nswarming with psychotic car thieves and to\nwatch out for anyone \"driving a Fiesta with a big\nscar on his face\".\nAfter all the competitors and marshals had\nbeen duly warned, Car 1 set off at one minute\npast midnight, followed by the rest in one\nminute intervals. The field was almost entirely\ncomposed of novices, with only one semi-expert\ncrew. The first half was fairly frantic, with the\nfresher crews learning the knack of navigating\nand co-driver/driver teamwork. There was only\none minor 'off when a Mini's wheel touched a rock, but a quick spot of work put it right.\nWhile the crew was waiting for a marshal to\narrive, they were suddenly confronted by two\narmed police cars, who had been scrambled to\nintercept what they thought were the psychotic\ncar thieves. Apparently there had been reports of\ncars being driven at speed in the area (funny\nthat!), so they put two and two together and got\nfive.

    "content": "22 Letters\nEditorial\nDo you remember when you were little and you\nwere asked what you wanted to be when you\ngrew up? The replies of Policeman, Fireman,\nDoctor, Nurse, Teacher, Vet and so on were\noften to be heard. In those days we wanted to be\nthe sort of people we read about in our story\nbooks.\nIf you ask the students around this college\nwhat job they want when they leave here, a fair\nnumber will answer you with: \"One that pays\nwell.\" They aren't too bothered about whether\nthey are happy doing their work, just as long as\nthey are earning enough. I guess some of them\nwill find their job satisfaction coming from the\npay cheque at the end of the month.\nThere are some who will not be bothered\nabout the money and will just want a job in\nwhich they will be happy, but in my experience,\nthey are a much smaller number. Then there are\npeople around who are somewhere between the\ntwo, who want to be happy and who also don't want to be on the poverty line.\nWhenever I'm asked what I want to do and I say that I want to teach, I get comments on the\nlow pay and long hours. The hours I put into\nFelix in a week vastly outnumber the hours I would work as a teacher and the pay is a lot\nlower as well. But I'm enjoying it. The money\ndoesn't bother me. I honestly don't think about\nit. I'd go for job satisfaction above salary any\nday.\nThe average starting salary for a21 year old\nwith a second class honours first degree is in the\nregion of \u00a312,800. I don't think I'd know what\nto do with that sort of money, let alone the tens\nof thousands of pounds that graduates from this\nplace will no doubt be earning in a few years\ntime. I 've pretty much survived on the measly\nstudent grant for the last three years and could\nquite happily carry on that way.\nI was talking to someone recently who was\nequating the cost of a flight he was taking to the\nStates with the price of musical equipment. I asked him what he'd have done with the money\nif he hadn't been going abroad and he said he'd probably have just frittered it away.\nI couldn't fritter money away of I tried. I have to put a great deal of thought into anything\nbefore I 'll buy it. I 'll spend hours working out if\nI really need it and if it's the cheapest one.\nBut there are a lot of people out there who\ncan have no trouble spending money. The\naverage student leaves university with an\noverdraft of about \u00a32,000 (I think that's about\nright). Some people will have run up the debt\nfrom expensive accommodation (and let's face\nit, even college accommodation isn't cheap),\nbuying text books and so on, but there are plenty\nof people who have spent it on down the bar on\nsmoking and drinking.\nI know of people who have left college with\nnearly three times the 'average' overdraft and\nfull student loans as well. They are the sort of\npeople who expect to be able to walk straight\ninto a well-paid job which will solve all their\nproblems. Chances are they probably will, and\nthen they'll just spend all that as well. It gets to\nbe a bit of a vicious circle. They know they've\ngot the money available to spend and so they\nspend it. Then when they run out, they go and\nget an extension on their overdraft and spend\nsome more. I can't see it ending for them.\nThey've got so used to having money and being\nable to get more if they need it. I wonder what\nthey'll do when one day they ask for an\noverdraft and the bank manager says \"No!\"\nAnthrax\nCompetition Winner:\n'Tilly' (!)

Imperial College Registry\nwere unable to find any records\nregarding his PhD. Sorrentino\nstated that the allegations were \"a red herring\" and that he resigned\nfor \"personal reasons\".\nThe story coincides with recent\nresearch by the Institute of\nManpower Studies. According to\ntheir findings, graduates are\nbecoming increasingly desperate for\njobs and are faking qualifications\non their application forms. Aware\nthat many potential employers\nrarely check the information, many\ngive fake results. With the job\nmarket now so competitive,\nuntrained selection staff are often\ntold to only select candidates from\nthe 'old' universities.\nMedical Negotiations\nBY ANDREW TSENG,\nNEWS EDITOR\nImperial College has taken a further\nstep in becoming a medical 'super-school'. Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nRector of Imperial College, has\nannounced the start of negotiations\nwith three medical institutes with a view to the merging of Imperial\nCollege with each of them.\nThe announcement comes\nalmost one year after the Executive\nCommittee of Imperial College's Governing Body expressed its\napproval of the merging of the\nRoyal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool, the Institute of Cancer\nResearch and the National Heart\nand Lung Institute with Imperial\nCollege.\nSir Ronald commented, \"It is\ngiving us the opportunity to rethink\nmedical education.\"\nMagazine\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nMembers of Imperial College's superlative Boat Club were shocked\nthis week to learn that their coach,\nBill Mason, is said to look like a terrorist. The appa rant resemblance\nwas spotted by the executive\ncommittee of the Amateur Rowing\nAssociation (ARA) when reviewing\nthe cover photo on what was to be\nthe latest issue of the Association's magazine, 'Regatta'.\nThe cover featured Mr Mason,\ndressed in black clothes and a sinister-looking balaclava with slits\nin the eyes and nose, shouting\ninstructions through a megaphone\nto rowers on the Thames. The\nphotograph, which had been\nwaiting to be used for six months,\nwas described as sinister, with Mr Mason looking like 'an IRA terrorist reviewing his men'.\nThe ARA ordered the issue to be\nwithdrawn. The 16,000 copies of\nthe magazine, which were to be\nmailed to members and other\nsubscribers on Tuesday, had to be\nreplaced with issues with a different\ncover. The replacing of the cover\nphotograph with one of Mr Mason\nin graduation regalia caused a delay\nof one week. The chairman of the\ncommittee, Mrs Di Ellis, said that\nthe original picture was\n\"inappropriate in any\ncircumstances\".\nThe cover photograph was\nintended to lead into a story about\nMr Mason, an Olympic and Imperial\nCollege coach, who recently\nreceived two awards - an honorary\ndegree from Imperial College and\nthe ARA's medal of honour.\nThe editor of the magazine, Mr\nChris Dodd, had redesigned the\nmagazine for this issue.

Let's Just Fly\nGlyph catches up with Colin and Ian, of Glasgow's One Dove.\nPerched on the edge of a creaky table, Ian tells\nus about the first ever One Dove gig. \"It was\nabout two years ago in Aberdeen and it was a total disaster. We were supposed to be miming\none song through the PA, and suddenly under\nthe dressing room door, we heard the track start.\nWe all piled out onto the stage with instruments\nand everything, then someone told the DJ to rip\nit off quick, and there we were in complete\nsilence.\" Since then, however, things have\nlooked up, with a support slot to the Shamen in\nGlasgow to their credit and the recent chart\nsuccesses of their two singles: 'White Dove' and\n'Breakdown'.\nThe press have had more than a small hand in\ntheir recent rise. \"Yes, the press have been very\ngood to us so far, we've had excellent reviews in\njust about everything. But the backlash is so\nclose now you can smell it.\" And a quick scan in\nthe NME review of tonight's gig would confirm\ntheir fears.\nHowever, other types of publicity are also in\nshort supply. \"The NME actually asked us if\nthey could use one of our tracks on their\ncompilation tape, so no, we didn't have to pull\nany strings. In fact we were also asked onto The\nBeat and Naked City on Channel 4, which was a good laugh.

    "content": "Music Special\nMJhmm ii fM fin\nM Jimmy Webb\nSuspending Disbelief\nIt's been over ten years since the writer of\n'MacArthur's Park' released his last album.\n'Suspending Disbelief is still a triumph of\nmiddle of the road rock, so nothing's changed.\nSentimental are the stories offered. 'It Won't Bring Her Back' picks the country myth of\ncrying into your beer and swings it about. \"You\ncan lay down on the railroad track, but it won't bring your baby back.\" The last note even ends\nas Johnny Cash would sing it, a sound so low\nyou have to dig it up. Yet a string of die-hard\nanodynes always overpowers the senses.\n'Adios' and 'What Does A Woman See In A Man' have particularly grating rhyming lyrics.\nMorose-close-adios and sure-insecure-pure\nbecome a mass of bad poetry.\nThankfully, some semblance is gained on the\nfinal T Will Arise' which is gospel worthy of\nthe name. A swooping joy is evident in the\nRocky Mountains Clear. \"When I die, hallelujah\nby and by, oh Lord, I 'll fly away.\" (5)\nTintin\nReleased on Elektra\nRight Said\nFred\nSex And Travel\nWell, this is the second album from the Freds.\nTheir first, 'Up', was a lively spray of different\nstyles, but they seem to have settled down to a pretty solidly dedicated dance motif: Bum t itty bum t itty bum bum bum. It's a very confident,\nbouncy sort of package, spotted here and there\nwith borrowed licks (and the odd nibble) from\nexternal sources, but it is still thoroughly their\nown style. My favourite track is 'She's My Mrs'\nwhich has a delightfully Abba intro and general\nfeel, but Boney M seeps through in the right\nplaces, and it works really well!\nI'm not so sure they picked the right singles.\nListen to 'Turn Me On'. It beats 'Bumped' as\nfar as I'm concerned. They haven't given us\nanything particularly 'Deeply Dippy', and as a whole it would be easy to say it's a bit\nrepetitive. But you only get that feeling when\nyou think back on what you've heard. Whilst\nit's happening, it'll do quite nicely. Oh, and\nthey're too sexy for this review. (7)\nDave T. Released on Tug Records\nFrank Zappa\nThe Yellow Shark\n\"This is Frank Zappa gone all orchestral,\" was\nthe first comment. If you're a contemporary\norchestral music fan, there is plenty in here to\ninspire you. Those familiar with Frank's( copious) catalogue of orchestral works will find\nthis collection very comfortable: Okay, so it's a bit cheesy, but it paints pictures in your head:\n'Pentagon Afternoon' plays the notes you see in\nDan Quayle's eyes when he thinks about a potato e( sic), then digs deeper to follow the\npolitical machinery, where you hear red-tape\ntwanging and twining, and the blas\u00a3 comments\nof the hordes of clerks who believe in it all.\nOther pieces are attempts to perform\nprogrammed synthesis er pieces live on real\ninstruments. Wow! 'Ruth Is Sleeping' is\ngorgeous: two pianos and two excellent pianists.\nIf you're familiar with it and don't like it, don't Seaweed\nGo Your Own Way\nI must admit I hated this on first listen, but it's actually quite a grower. Seaweed's sound is\nmost easily (if not best) described by stating that\nthey're on the Sub Pop label and mentioning the\n'N' word. This version of the Fleetwood Mac\nhit is played with much more energy and\nfashionably much less ability than the original\nbut without really adding anything new. Well\nworth buying however for the two corking B sides which are excellent in a punk y thrash yg run gry albeit derivative way.\nFreddy Cheeseworth\nReleased on Sub Pop\nbuy it! Oh, and whoever you are, avoid 'Food\ngathering in post-industrial America': It'sca ck that squeezed through the net. Luckily it's short:\n2 minutes 52 seconds of disappointment out of\n90 minutes!\nMost of what's going on, including the shark,\nis explained in the honest and nicely\nphotographed booklet that comes with the CD. I saw the boxed masterpiece and immediately\nwanted it. It makes a friendly archive of some of\nFrank's mood swings, emotional outbursts, and\nmoments of sheer weirdness.\nIf you're new to the Zappa orchestral scene,\nmaybe you should listen to 'Be-Bop Tango'\nfirst; it's a cracking re-orchestration, with an\ninspired and unusual 'middle-8' (I guess you\ncould call it) to break up what every Frank\nworshipper already knows as a good, solid hit.\nNice! I'm not going to tell you what happens,\nbecause I think you should buy it! (9)\nDave T. Released on Zappa Records\nKingmaker\nSaturday's Not What It\nUsed To Be\nI 've always had this respect from afar for Loz\nHardy, mainly due to his rhino-skinned stoicism\nto the often indifferent music press.\n'Saturday's...' is no doubt a very English\nlament, but I haven't got a clue what he's on\nabout. Even with ex-Attraction Steve Nieve on\nkeyboards, the result is rather insipid, though\nnot utterly direction less. This is strictly for the\ndiehard.\nCamille\nReleased on Scorch\nKingmaker and the incredibly respectful Loz\nMadder Rose are reviewed in concert on page 9\n\n"
