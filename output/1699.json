    "content": "\u201cGluey synth\nnotes and a\nshuffling drum\nimmediately\ncast a shadow\non everything\nand take us in\na completely\ndifferent\ndirection.\u201d\nWith a new Chance the Rapper project supposedly on\nIt\u2019s simultaneously becoming increasingly easy and\ndifficult to ignore Kanye West. Apparently, he\u2019s been\n\u201cworking on\u201d a new Chance the Rapper album.\nWhat that means or whether it even matters (see the\nsubstandard Ye or elusive Yahndi) is to be seen. Still, let\u2019s\ntake this as an excuse to revisit Chance\u2019s magnum opus.\n\u201cChance\ndoesn\u2019t shy\naway from\ncoating the\nseemingly\nupbeat and\nlively moments\nwith dollops\nof melancholic\njuxtaposition\ntoo.\u201d\nI\nn 2016, we witnessed\nChance the Rapper\u2019s\nspiritual rebirth as \u201clil\nChano from 79th\u201d on\nthe prophetic \u2018Ultralight\nBeam\u2019; a moment that\nwould formally introduce\na more sober, sweet as\nSunday Candy, family\nman of a gospel-rap-per-Chano, who the\nmainstream would come\nto adore following the\nrelease of his debut album\nColouring Book the same\nyear. However, before\nthat, there was Chance the\ndaydreamer stoner, still\nwide-eyed and ingenuous\noff the success of his debut\nmixtape 10 Day inspired\nby his ten-day suspension\nfrom high school for being\ncaught smoking weed.\nThat mixtape would only\nhint at the full potential of\nChance\u2019s artistry that we\nwould witness the next\nyear on Acid Rap.\nAcid Rap is charismatic,\nenergetic and hopeful but\nself-aware in a somewhat\ndisarming way. Indeed,\nyou wouldn\u2019t have hated\nthe project for coming off\na little na\u00efve. It would\u2019ve\nbeen a small price to pay\nfor the witty wordplay\nand infectious flows that\nChance delivers, and\nthe way it is wrapped\nin animated and often\nundeniably playful pro-duction. Nevertheless, as\nwell as Chance gets your\nhead bobbing during his\nhighs, he makes a point\nof walking us through the\nnuance and hollowness\nof his low moments with\nhonesty and precision. Of\ncourse, \u2018Paranoid\u2019, \u2018Lost\u2019\nand \u2018Acid Rain\u2019 are tracks\nthat illustrate this clearly,\neach a delicate, floating\ndollops of melancholic\njuxtaposition too. Indeed,\ninthiswayChancerealises\nhis wider vision for this\nmixtape \u2013 his project\nembodies the off kilter and\nrestless spirit of a routine\ndrug user. The lows are\nbad, but the highs are also\ntinted a sunset-purple.\nAnd he\u2019s hopeful and he\u2019s\nself-aware but still, you\nwonder whether that\u2019s\na mark of him applying\nhimself or more a result of\nviewing his life from the\nvantage point of drug-in-duced dissociation.\nThe first track, \u2018Good\nAss Intro\u2019, introduces this\nmind state with a harmonically sung interpolation\nof a Kanye deep cut over\ntheatrical keys: \u201cEven\nbetter than I was the last\ntime/ I\u2019m good\u201d. Having\ncome to know the mixtape\nwell, this opening chorus\nstrikes me as something\nakin to someone forcing\nthemselves to have a good\ntrip, trying desperately to\nignore and thus cast away\nthe anxiety in their gut.\nChance\u2019s opening line is\na tent peg that he attaches\nto the mixtape\u2019s title lest\nwe forget the core of\nhis disposition despite\nall his good humour to\nfollow: \u201cRap just make\nme anxious, and acid\nmade me crazy\u201d. The\nsong continues to grow\ninto a powerful, layered\nballad with a charged\nbeat as more instruments\nare added, featuring sung\nvocals weaving around\nthe verses and coming to\na climax on the passionate outro. Chance gets\nflashy with his flow while\nrapping about his carefree\nliving and misplaced\npride. He continues to ride\nthis high on the next track,\n\u2018Pusha Man\u2019 \u2013 ignorant\nand proud, he claims to\nbe a \u201cPimp slappin\u2019, toe\ntaggin\u2019\u201d pusha man. An\nintentional metaphor, the\nsong \u2018Paranoid\u2019 is hidden\nwithin this track after\nsome silence. Gluey synth\nnotes and a shuffling\ndrum immediately cast a\nshadow on everything and\ntake us a in a completely\ndifferent direction. We\u2019re\ntaken to Chance\u2019s gloomy,\ncrime-filled neighbourhood in Chicago where\nhe feels \u201cTrapped in the\nmiddle of the map\u201d, his\ncry at the end of his first\nverse articulating the\nfrustration of growing up\nin such an environment.\nChance witnessed his best\nfriend Rodney\u2019s murder at\n18. He raps on this song\nwith an insight and a raw\nemotion only someone\nwho\u2019s been through\nsomething like that could.\nEach verse gets more\npoignant and vulnerable.\nHaving set the scene in\nthe first, he talks about a\nhopeless cycle of murder\nin the second, inevitable\nwhen \u201c\u2026it\u2019s easier to\nfind a gun/ Than it is to\nfind a fucking parking\nspot\u201d. Heading into verse\nthree, he acknowledges\nthe climate of fear and\nparanoia surrounding him\nand implores the listener\nto do the same for the\nsake of empathy. Perhaps\nknowing this won\u2019t ultimately change things, he\nthen recommends saying\ngoodbye to loved ones\nbefore it\u2019s summer and\npraying for a longer spring\nbecause, as he tragically\nmuses, \u201ceverybody\u2019s\ndying in the summer\u201d.\n\u2018Cocoa Butter Kisses\u2019\nis one of those songs\nwhich is a product of\nstars aligning.

Yemen is the battle arena, and its citizens, collateral damage.\nCOMMENT\nAida Manzano\nKharman\nComment Editor\nA\ns of March\n2018 the death\ntoll in Yemen\nhas surpassed\n40,000 casualties. Save\nThe Children reports that\nat least 50,000 children\nhave died in 2017 alone,\nand to this day and\ncounting the amount of\ndisplaced refugees is well\nover 2 million.\nThe civil war in\nYemen has been raging\non since 2015, and\nwhile it\u2019s importance\nand coverage in the\nmainstream media has\nbeen steadily decreasing,\nthe casualties have been\nexponentially increasing\nas the humanitarian crisis\nbecomes more severe and\ndeadly.\nThe situation, as in\nmany countries in the\nMiddle East, is quite\ncomplex and is a result of\nmany unresolved issues\nescalating to a what now\nseems like an unsolvable\nconflict. Yemen up until\nthe 90s was split into\ntwo different countries,\nNorth Yemen: Yemen\nArab Republic (YAR) and\nSouth Yemen: People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic of\nYemen (PDRY).\nNorthern Yemen\nwas federated with\nE g y p t a n d S y r i a i n\nthe United Arab\nStates until they\nproclaimed their\nindependence and a civil\nwar broke out between the\nroyalist forces supported\nby Jordan and Saudi\nArabia and the republican\nforces, supported by\nEgypt. By 1968 most\nopposing leaders had\nreconciled and by 1970\nthe YAR was finally\nrecognised by Saudi\nArabia and the Egyptian\ntroops withdrew.\nThe former Southern\nYemen was under British\nrule until 1965. In the\ntwo years following that,\nthe Marxist National\nLiberation Front (NLF)\nand the Front for the\nLiberation of Occupied\nSouth Yemen (FLOSY)\norganised themselves\nto leave the British\ncontrolled Federation of\nSouth Arabia. By 1967 the\nfederation collapsed and\nthe People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic of Yemen was\nproclaimed in 1970.\nThe divide was clear,\nwhilst the YAR was\nsupported by Saudi\nArabia, the PDRY was\nan ally of the Soviet\nUnion. As the situations\nsettled internally in\neach newly proclaimed\ncountry, internationally\ntheir relations became\nmore strained. In the\nearly 70s they were\nopenly confrontational.\nThe road to unification\nwas not simple, but in\n1988 both parties agreed\nto demilitarise their\nborder and in 1990 the\nfirst drafts for a unified\nconstitution began. These\nwere ultimately approved\nby a referendum and the\npresident of the YAR\nbecame the president of\nthe new republic, and the\npresident of the PDRY\nwas named vice president.\nPeace did not last long\nin the newly formed\ncountry due to the poor\neconomic conditions and\nin the unrest of the civil\npopulation,civilwarbroke\nout. Salih, the president of\nthe republic, won the civil\nwar and in the aftermath,\nhe appointed those who\nhad been loyal to him\nthroughout the war into\npower. He also eliminated\nfreedoms such as\nuniversal suffrage. Other\nconsequences of the war\nwere the devaluing of the\nriyal, theYemeni currency,\nthe cost of fuel doubled,\nwater and electricity were\nin short supply, and food\ncosts rose.\nIt was the public\ndiscontent in 2011,\nprompted by other\nuprisings during the Arab\nSpring, that led to mass\nprotests. In 2014 civil war\nbroke out again, as the\nHouthis seized the capital\nin demands of lower fuel\nprices and a new, reformed\ngovernment. Houthis are\nShiite rebels that have\nbeen supported by Iran.\nFighting against them are\nthe Hadis, the faction that\nsupported the president\nAbd Rabbu Mansour\nHadi of the government\nthat was forced to resign\nby the Houthis. They are\nSunnis, and are supported\nby SaudiArabia, a country\nof Sunni majority.\nAlready from the 70s\nthere was a clear divide\nfrom the Soviet allied\nShiite south, and the\nSaudi allied Sunni north.\nand Saudi Arabia is\ntaking place. Saudi Arabia\nneighbours Yemen and\nshares a vast border with\nthem, and many Yemeni\ncitizens cross it to seek\nwork in Saudi Arabia.\nIn 2003 Saudi Arabia\nbegan its construction\nof a physical barrier that\nwas even compared to\nthat between Israel and\nPalestine. Their reasoning\nwas to prevent terrorist\ninfiltrations but its\nconstruction inflamed the\nYemeni government, that\nargued it was a violation\nof human rights and the\n2000 Jeddah border treaty,\nthat allowed Yemeni\nshepherds for grazing\nrights at the border.\nInterestingly enough, after\nthe Saudi led intervention\nin Yemen in 2015, the\nformer country began\nremoving the border with\nits neighbour.\nHowever, like many\nconflicts in the Middle\nEast, although many\npoint to the cause being\nreligious, the disputes are\nmainly political. Whilst\nHouthis were indeed\nfounded as a Zaydi Shiaa\nrevivalist movement,\ntheir claims had little to\ndo with religion, as it was\nthe demand to have the\nfuel subsidies restored\nthat initially made Houthi\nsupporters take to the\nstreets as a sign of protest.\nUltimately Yemen has\nbecome the battlefield\nwhere Saudi Arabia has\nconcentrated its efforts\nto ensure that the rest of\nthe world know that they\nwon\u2019t let their neighbours\nbecome allies or affiliated\nwith their declared\nenemy Iran. And since\nit seems that whoever is\nopenly at conflict with\nIran will immediately\nChild Gazing at Rubble in Yemen after a after Saudi led Coalition Airstrike// Flickr\n\u201cAt least\n50,000\nchildren have\ndied alone in\n2017\u201d\nDespite the efforts to\nbuild a lasting union,\nlittle was done to ensure\nthe conditions for the\ncivil society were fit to\nwarrant the development\nnecessary to solidify\nsaid union. No country\nwill remain stable if its\ncitizens do not have basic\nneeds met, and that was\nthe first failing point of\nYemen. Adding to that\nthe sectarian and political\ndivisions, the chances of\npeace are even lower, and\nthe final and perhaps the\nmost important factor are\nthe external key players\u2019\ninterests.\nThe war that is currently\ntaking place in Yemen is\nthe materialised reflection\nof where currently the\ncold war between Iran\n\n"

Fred S\nFyles did an incredible job\nwith the paper last year.\nSome say that his middle\nname is, in fact, Superman\n(though I wouldn't be surprised if his middle name\nwere actually Felix).

I suffer from\na toxic combination of\nsevere procrastination\nsyndrome, complete lack\nof organisational skill and\ncrippling laziness.

Somehow\nthat\u2019s something a man\nwould not apologise\nfor. But if a woman succumbed to the very same,\nvitriol and profanities are\nhurled her way.

Women get angry\nand they are emotional\nand hysterical.\nIs it because of the\nculture\u2019s insistence on\nsubservience for every\nwoman?\nWhen some men\nsupport their wives\nand their daughters and\nperhaps in some communities those men are\nshunned by their peers\nand motives questioned,\n\u201cwhat are you doing?\nYou\u2019re upsetting a norm\nthat\u2019s been comfortable\nfor us.\u201d Just because\ntreating women that way\nhas been customary and\npracticed for eons doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean it\u2019s\nveracious.\nDerived from the\nGreek, misogyny means\n\u201cwoman-hater.\u201d It\u2019s not a\ndifficult term to explain,\nbut, like sexism and\nfeminism, a lot of people\nrefuse to acknowledge\nthat it exists and a lot of\nothers don\u2019t comprehend\nhow women all over the\nglobe have to pay a price\nfor just being who they\nare. How to tell whether\nyou\u2019re a misogynist or\ndealing with one? The use\nof the word \u2018female\u2019 as a\nnoun rather than an adjective objectifies women as\nthings instead of beings.\n(\u201cThese females are\nalways complaining...\u201d\nor \u201cstop acting like a\nfemale\u201d) If a man rolls\nhis eyes, laughs, scoffs or\nraises his eyebrows, all\nof which are derogatory\nand condescending, when\nyou express important\nopinions, ideas or feelings,\nthen he\u2019s a misogynist.\nUpon hearing that a\nwoman or girl has been\nsexually abused or as-saulted, if the first three\nquestions are \u201cWhat was\nshe wearing?\u201d, \u201cWhat\nwas she doing there?\u201d,\nand \u201cWell, what did she\nthink would happen?\u201d\nthat person is a misogy-nist. Women are told they\nasked for it, or that it\u2019s\ntheir fault. It\u2019s because\nof this ostracism that it\u2019s\nnot easy for a woman to\ncome out and say I was\ntroubled or I was hurt.\nWomen survive but why\nshould they? It shouldn\u2019t\nbe a world where women\nsurvive. It should be one\nwhere women thrive.\nIt\u2019s not that women\ncan\u2019t take a joke. It\u2019s that\nmisogyny is a hate crime\nand it isn\u2019t funny.\ngarner the U.S\u2019s support,\nit is unsurprising to see\nhow invested the U.S\nhas become on the \u201cwar\non terror\u201d in Yemen,\nultimately costing even\nmore civilian lives than\nterrorist ones. In the words\nof senator Chris Murphy\nanswering to the U.S\u2019s\nresponsibility in the death\nof civilians and human\nrights violations due to\nthe interventions: \u201cI think\nthat there is a U.S. imprint\non every civilian death\ninside Yemen.

But at what cost?\nAre Yemeni lives merely\ncollateral damage?\nWould we tolerate these\ninterventions if they\nwere causing so many\ndeaths and refugees in a\nfirst world country?

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 5TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nZombie cells\nSCIENCE\nLucy Rowlands\nScience Writer\nT\nhe zombies are\nhere, except\nturns out it\u2019s on\na cellular scale,\nso stop boarding up your\nwindows and pick up\nthat microscope! In new\nresearch from Dr Baker at\nthe Mayo Clinic, scientists\nfound that removing se-nescent cells, also known\nas \u2018zombie\u2019 cells, reduced\nsymptoms associated with\nage related degenerative\ndiseases.\nSenescent cells are\nunable to perform the\nfunctions of a normal\ncell but are unable to\ndie, meaning that they\nbuild up over time and\nare associated with a\nnumber of age-related\ndiseases including ather-osclerosis, osteoarthritis\nand Alzheimer\u2019s. It had\nbeen thought that these\nwere simply innocent bystanders that do not cause\ndamage, however recent\nwork has suggested that\nthey release inflammatory\nsignals, which disturb the\nsurrounding cells.\nScientists found that\nwhen they cleared se-nescent cells in the mice\nbrains, using a genetically\nmodified enzyme, the\nmice retained the ability to\nform new memories and\nshowed reduced outward\nsigns of cognitive decline.\nThey were also able to\nidentify that two types of\nbrain cells, \u2018microglia\u2019\nand \u2018astrocytes\u2019, were the\ntypes that became senes-cent. These are immune\ncells linked to neuronal\nhealth and signalling.\nThis is one of the first\npieces of evidence that\nsenescent cells play a\nrole in neurodegenerative\ndiseases and opens potential new avenues for\ntreatment. The scientist,\nin this study, also used\ndrugs that have been\nshown to damage senes-cent cells to see if the\ndrugs had a similar effect\nto the enzyme. When the\ndrug was administered\nfor the first six months\nof the mouse\u2019s life, their\nbrains had fewer tangles\nof a protein called tau,\na marker of cognitive\ndecline.\nWhilst these findings\nare promising, a cure\nfor neurodegenerative\ndiseases isn\u2019t quite on\nthe horizon yet. The\napproach taken in these\nexperiments represents\nthe best-case scenario\nand would be difficult to\napply clinically as it was\na preventative measure.\nAlso, targeted treatments\ncan be difficult, as older\npeople tend to have lots of\ncells that look like these\nharmful senescent cells,\nand so it remains to be\nseen if a treatment can\ndistinguish between the\ntwo.\nIn the future, Dr Baker\nand his team will focus\non treating animals after\nthe disease has started,\nlooking at specific alterations that happen on a\nmolecular scale in the\ncells they identify.\nBacteria in poop: the key to losing weight?\nS\nummer is officially over and,\ntemporarily, we\ndon\u2019t need our\nsummer bodies. However,\nlosing weight is not just\nabout looking nice on\nsandy beaches; obesity is\none of the key risk factors\nthat causes cardiovascular\ndisease and other chronic\ndiseases.\nObesity is a multi-facet\ncondition: genetics,\nactivity level and diet all\ncontribute. Solutions to\nthis issue are obviously to\nexercise and eat healthily.\nOn the extreme side,\nsurgery is also an option.\nHowever, associated risks\ncan be severe, and therefore only morbidly obese\nindividuals are offered\nthis treatment in the UK.\nRecently, the role of the\nimmune system in obesity\nhas also been investigated.\nThere are many different\npopulations of microorganisms living in our\ndigestive tracts, known as\ngut flora. The relationship\nbetween gut flora and us\ncan be beneficial; some\nhelp us digest dietary fibre\nin vegetables, breaking it\ndown so we can absorb\nit. Gut flora also produce\nvitamin B and K for us\nand prevent the growth of\nharmful organisms.\nNevertheless, like a\nwell-organised company,\nthis beneficial effect only\nworks with a specific\npopulation of flora. In\na company, we need\na certain number of\nemployees, each with\ndifferent talents and roles.\nThat way, the company\ncan efficiently carry out\nits daily routine. If most of\nthe employees decided to\nquit one day, the company\nwould face crisis and less\nideal candidates may be\nhired to keep the company\ngoing.\nAntibiotics, like an\neconomic crisis to our\nimaginary company, can\nwipe out the good bacteria\nand affect the host\u2019s\nability to digest food. The\nabsence of these florae\nmay also fail to stop\npathogens from growing,\nleading to diarrhoea. Furthermore, it has also been\nshown that people who are\nobese have a different gut\nflora profile. While it is\nunclear whether the shift\nin gut flora population\ncauses obesity or the other\nway around, there is certainly a clear association\nbetween the two.\nThe shift in gut flora\nprofile activates the\nimmune system, exacerbating the situation\nand increases the risk of\ncancer and autoimmune\ndiseases. A research group\nin the University of North\nCarolina has tried to\nmanipulate the immune\nsystem in mice to investigate its effect in obesity.\nThey suspected that\nhigh-fat diet induces the\nimbalance of the delicate\ngut flora ecosystem by\nincreasing inflammatory\nresponse in the body.\nNLRP12, a leucine-rich\nrepeating protein (NLRP),\nis a mediator of the\nimmune system and\npromotes the resolution\nof inflammation. Nonetheless, its role in obesity\nis unknown in reality. To\ninvestigate, the researchers hypothesised NLRP12\ncan reduce weight gain\nby damping down the\nimmune system and\nreducing inflammation\nto the gut and fat tissue\nwhilst the removal of this\nprotein would have the\nopposite effect. Putting\nthe theory to test, the\nscientists knocked out the\ngene coding for NLRP12,\nSenescent cells can lead to Alzheimer\u2019s//Wikimedia\nso the mice didn\u2019t have\nthese receptors in their\ncells.\nAs a result, these\nknockout animals were\nrelatively fatter despite\nhaving the same diet and\nlifestyle as the control\ngroup. These mice were\nalso less sensitive to\ninsulin,makingthemmore\nsusceptible to diabetes.\nThe obese mice also had\nmore immune cells in\ntheir fat tissue, with a very\nspecific pro-inflammatory\ncell population (M1 mac-rophages). Elevated levels\nof pro-inflammatory cell\nsignalling molecules, like\nTNF (tumour necrosis\nfactor) and IL-6 (interleu-kin-6), which are released\nfrom the fat tissue, were\nalso found in the obese\nmice.\nFurthermore, analysing\nthe gut microbiome in\nthe mice, they found that\nmice with a high-fat diet\nand NLRP12 knockout\nhad a lower bacterial\ndiversity in the intestine,\ncorrelating to inflammation and obesity. Faecal\ntransplants from obese\nmice to other mice also\npromote weight gain\nand putting normal and\nknockout mice together\nin one cage can reduce\nobesity in the knockouts\nby coprophagic-transfer\nof microorganisms\n(poop-eating). Upon\nanalysing the popula-tion, the researchers\nalso identified families\nof bacteria that are more\npredominant in obese\nmice, namely, the Erysipelotrichaceae promotes\nweight gain. Contrarily,\nthe Lachnospiraceae\nfamily seemingly has\na beneficial effect on\nweight loss.\nWhile faecal transplant seems unhygienic\nanddifficulttoimplement\nin humans, chemical\nproducts that the good\nbacteria produce could\npotentially be packaged\nas supplements to treat\ndiabetes and obesity.\nThough more experimental data is required\nto verify the beneficial\nbacterial population, this\nstrategy is certainly a relatively inexpensive and\neasy (in terms of lifestyle\nchanges) solution.\n\u201cThe shift\nin gut flora\nprofile\nincreases\nthe risk of\ncancer and\nautoimmune\ndisease.\u201d\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\n\u201cObese\npeople have a\ndifferent gut\nflora profile.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "the way, let us revisit his iconic Acid Rap mixtape\ntheme of the song. From\nVic Mensa and Chance\nwriting their verses while\non shrooms, to the beat\nbeing produced after the\nvocals were recorded\nover an alternative beat,\nto somehow landing a\nTwista feature, the song\nis testament to what an\natypical project this is both\nin vision and creation. We\nare drawn in by a gospel\norgan but before long, its\ndivine connotation is juxtaposed and then buried\nby dirty, bouncing, NewYork-style drums that\nspells corrupted exuber-ant. All the while, playful\nsynth embellishments and\nsoothing, atmospheric\nwails accentuate the bars,\na contracting-relaxing\npiano chord progression\ngluing it all together.\nChance paints us his\ndelinquent childhood with\na lexicon of references,\nVic acknowledges the\nstupid pride to be found\nin intoxication (\u201cGot\nme feeling like Lauryn\nHill\u201d), Twista scorches\nthe track with a typical\nconfident, fast flow, whilst\nlending veteran wisdom\nto the topic at hand and\nmanagingtorhyme\u201cHiggs\nBoson\u201d and \u201cVoltron\u201d.\nFollowing \u2018Juice\u2019, the\nproject\u2019s simple yet addictive single with a call and\nresponse hook, we get the\nbitter sweet \u2018Lost\u2019. The\nfirst of many exceptional\ncollaborations between\nChano and Noname,\nthe song is an ode to\ntroubled relationships\nstuck in a cycle of drugs,\nlust, depression and\ndebilitating dependence.\n\u2018Everybody\u2019s Something\u2019\nis a track that sees Chance\nand Saba reflecting on\nvarious topics \u2013 morality,\nreligion, drug abuse, de-pression, police brutality,\nblackness, luck and time\n\u2013 all through a disillusioned Chicago-born lens.\nThough this introspection\ncan leave one feeling\nhollow, Chance reminds\nus not to lose our self-worth: \u201cEverybody\u2019s\nsomebody\u2019s everything\u201d.\nFollowing this sentiment,\nChance raps a list of\nsimiles articulating how\nlove is, in his opinion, the\nbest possible thing in the\nsincere and heart-warm-ing interlude track \u2018That\u2019s\nLove\u2019.\nThe next three tracks\nare more light-hearted,\neach featuring a non-Chi-cagoan rapper who is\nnow a household name\n(Childish Gambino,\nAction Bronson and AbSoul). The best of these is\n\u2018Favourite Song\u2019, a hilariously silly self-referential\ntrack about why it should\nbe your favourite song.\nChance starts the song\nwith some of the cleverest\nand catchiest lines of\nthe project, packed with\nalliteration, assonance\nand an astounding rhyme\nscheme: \u201cChance, acid\nrapper, soccer, hacky\nsacker/ Cocky khaki\njacket jacker/ Slap-happy\nfaggot slapper\u2026\u201d. He\nthen glides into a carefree,\nhalf-sung, infectious flow,\nrepeating this formula\nin his second verse.\nGambino adds a laid-back\nverse with hilariously\nrelatable commentary on\nthe reception of a hit song;\nfrom a friend wanting\ncredit for putting you on,\nto jamming to it \u201cin Abercrombie when your work\nis finished\u201d.\n\u2018Acid Rain\u2019 is arguably\nthe most essential track\nof the project, the well-earned climax Chance\nhad been working towards\nthis whole time. The beat\nis comprised of a bassy\nsnare, desolate strings\nand eerie moans. We hear\nChance\u2019s internal monologue as he trips acid in\nthe rain. He approached\nhis thoughts with maturity,\nand though he acknowledges that he will always\nfeel unsettled, nostalgic or\nanxious on certain issues,\nhe reached enough conclusions within the three\nand half minutes to be a\n\u201cnew man\u2026baptized\u2026\nholy\u2026sanctified\u2026born\nagain\u201d. Amongst conclusions on the troubles and\nartificialness of wealth,\nand on taking active steps\nto replace gang violence\nwith support for Chicago\u2019s youth, Chance spits a\ntelling line that introspects\non his drug use: \u201cI trip to\nmake the fall shorter.\u201d He\ntrips to soften the blow\nof his failures, he trips\nto prevent himself from\nfalling too deep into his\npit of demons, he trips to\nmake his Autumn shorter;\nperhaps an indication\nof boredom, but more\nlikely an indication of\nthe season\u2019s bleakness\nfollowing summers of\nhigh crime rates that claim\nthe lives of his friends\n(Rodney died in September). Nevertheless, on\nthe last two tracks of the\nalbum, each beautifully\nproduced, Chance reassures us that he\u2019s still the\nebullient kid we met at\nthe start of the mixtape\nand that, despite any\nmisfortune or evils, he\ncan still reminisce about\nhis happiest moment\nand know, sincerely, that\n\u201ceverything\u2019s good\u201d.\nAlthough Acid Rap\nwould go on to become\nwhat propelled Chance\nthe Rapper into stardom,\nit is clear that its purpose\nwas more than that. Acid\nRap was for Chicago and\nfor the youth. It was to\nuplift the disillusioned\nwhilst telling them they\u2019re\nnot alone. It was for\nstoners, church goers, and\nlost friends like Rodney.\nAnd it was for hip hop.\nChance\u2019s\u20183\u2019cap quickly became an iconic insignia following the release of his third project, Colouring Book // dancingastronaut\nISSUE 1699\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\n\u201cChance\nreassures us\nthat he\u2019s still\nthe ebullient\nkid we met at\nthe start of the\nmixtape\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Acid Rain\u2019is\narguably the\nmost essential\ntrack of the\nproject, the\nwell-earned\nclimax Chance\nhad been\nworking\ntowards this\nwhole time.\u201d\n\u201c...the song\nis an ode\nto troubled\nrelationships\nstuck in a cycle\nof drugs, lust,\ndepression\nand\ndebilitating\ndependence. \u201d\n\n"

I wanted to\nmake an informed\ndecision so I did the sane\nthing \u2013 I bought a media\npass and packed my\nbags for the International\nConference Centre\n(ICC) in Birmingham.\nThe Conference was\nenlightening\u2026 it certainly\nchanged my perspective\nof the Conservative Party.\nYou can broadly split\nus up into three main\ncategories: Conservatives, press and exhib-itors. Each type had a\ndifferent colour on their\nbadge to indicate their\nseparate status \u2013 mine\nhad a beautiful yellow\nstreak. There is mixing\nbetween all three groups,\nbut press members are\ndefinitely considered\nseparate to the others.\nAt the ICC, all you\nneed to do is make\neye contact and talk\nto someone. There are\nso many people and so\nmany sessions that you\ncan connect with people\nover anything. It\u2019s the\nLinkedIn Premium\nUser\u2019s wet dream. You\ndon\u2019t need to be equals\nin age or status \u2013 you get\nthe opportunity to rub\nshoulders with CEOs,\nministers and some of\nthe highest in society.\nThere is so much interaction that it makes\nyou want to crash with\nexhaustion at the end of\neach day.\nThe conference\ndoesn\u2019t end at 5pm. Oh,\nno. Don\u2019t look at what\nthe formal agenda says.\nEvents on the fringes of\nthe conference last until\n10pm on some nights.\nYou may meet some\npeople at these events,\nand you may get on with\nthem very well. They\nmay invite you for a\ndrink. The night spreads\nout beyond the conference centre \u2013 every pub\nand restaurant in the\nnear vicinity is taken\nover for drinks. But this\nis definitely less so the\ncase if you\u2019re \u2018press\u2019.\nOr maybe I just didn\u2019t\nknow the right people?\nHow do you find\nsomeone with your same\ninterests? And, most im-portantly, how can you\nbe dancing with young\nTories on the dance-floor? The answers lie\nin the Fringe events.\nThe Fringe is where\nyou go to get the\njuicy gossip and fiery\nspeeches. What you\nsee on television is a\nlie \u2013 the power of the\nconference is in the\nFringe, not the ministerial speeches with\npre-planned material.\nThe Fringe gives you a\nchance to interact with\nMPs, industry experts\nand CEOs on a one-to-one basis. The Fringe\nalso provides the best\nseminars. You can ask\nquestions on anything\nand they will answer\nyou directly. You also\nget access to those\npopulist politicians,\nthose without a cabinet\nposition but hold a lot of\nsway in the party. In the\nfringe Jacob Rees-Mogg\nis a sell-out name. The\nqueue for the Brexitcentral rally which he\nstarred in spans four\nfloors of the building\nfifteen minutes before\nthe start. The Fringe is\nwhere Boris Johnson\ndelivered his leadership\npitch to both press and\nmembers on the hall\nfloor.\nBut here\u2019s the interesting thing \u2013 most fringe\nevents are sponsored,\nto raise specific topics\nrather than for organic\nconversation. Event\nsponsors include the\nHuffington Post, Atos,\nNationwide, the Royal\nCollege of Midwives \u2013\nthe list goes on. Some of\nthese sponsors also have\nexhibits as well, so you\ncan\u2019t escape from them.\nExhibitors are different to sponsors. In\nthe centre of the ICC,\nthere are a collection of\nexhibition stands. Each\nof them has goodies to\nentice you in. Think\nof Freshers\u2019 Fair on\nsteroids. Let\u2019s take a\nstep back and consider\nthe names of some\nexhibitors this year:\nAECOM (currently\nexpanding Waterloo\nstation), Airbus (CEO\ncomplained that government doesn\u2019t know\nhow to run Brexit),\nDrax (taking over ScottishPower, had image\nproblems from a Channel\n4 documentary), Google\n(tax avoidance issues),\nthe list goes on. It is\nobvious that these exhibitors have concerns\nwith the government\u2019s\npolicies. Meanwhile,\nconference space is\nexpensive. To get access\nto these stands, you\nneeded at least \u00a35000.\nThat was just for the\nsmall exhibits; larger\nstalls required \u00a312,000\nupwards.\nSo why go to all this\neffort? Lobbying. You\nchat with important\npeople and you hope\nto keep your company\nand your desire in the\nconversation. All the\nexhibitors want to sway\nthe common perception.\nFor example, consider\nBlackpool \u2013 a seaside\nresort in the north-west\nof England which has\nbuilt a questionable\nreputation for itself over\nthe past few years due to\ndegeneration. Blackpool\nlast held the Conservative Conference in 2009.\nAfter this, the town was\nbarred from holding the\nconference as there were\nno suitable venues to\nhost a conference of that\nsize. This was a massive\nblow for tourism in the\ntown. So, Blackpool\nchanged. Nine years\nlater, and Blackpool has\ncompletely revamped\nits image. It has a\nnew town hall, will be\nbuilding a new IMAX\ncinema by 2020 and\nhas just completed it\nwork on its \u00a325 million\nconference centre at\nWinter Gardens. After\nmaking these changes,\npeople in the council\nbought an exhibition\nstand at the 2018 conference so they could\nshow their regeneration\nto the country. And did\nit work? According to\none of the exhibitors,\nonlookers wanted to\nreturn to Blackpool with\nmany signing a petition\nto return the conference\nto Blackpool next year.\nSo, place your bets now.\nThat was just some of\nwhat I learnt during my\ntime there. I learned way\ntoo much to cram into\nthis piece. All I know is\nthat this Conference will\nbe one that stays with\nme for the rest of my\nlife. And if it is held in\nBlackpool next year, I\nwill go and visit \u2013 after\nall, Blackpool has a\nfantastic Wetherspoons\non the Promenade.\nShe is the Dancing Queen! // RT\nPolitics Writer\nAnonymous\nPOLITICS\nFRIDAY, 5TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\n9\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1699\nFELIX\n6\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMy Visit to Labour Conference: Thoughts on\nthe Government in Waiting\nPresident of Imperial Labour Society, Ansh Bhatnagar, shares his views on the 2018 Labour\nParty Conference\nPOLITICS\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nPresident of Imperial\nLabour Society\nL\nast week, I\ntravelled along\nwith three other\nImperial students\nto the annual Labour Party\nConference, this year\nheld in the great city of\nLiverpool. After a long,\ndifficult summer in the\nparty, with lots of division\nbetween the two factional\nwings, I didn\u2019t know if I\nshould be looking forward\nto the coming few days.\nFirstly, a bit of background about me: I\u2019m not\nsomeone who is massively involved in politics;\nthe first time I paid any\nattention to it in the news\nwas around the 2015\nGeneral Election. Having\nheard about the tripling\nof tuition fees and the end\nof maintenance grants, as\nwell as wider issues such\nas the real terms cuts to\nthe NHS and our schools,\nit seemed to me that\nLabour was the only party\ntalking about these issues\nand taking them seriously.\nUnfortunately, I was\ntoo young to vote in that\nelection. Fast forward\nto when I came to uni in\n2016 and decided to join\nboth the Labour Party\nand the Labour Society\nat Imperial. It was great\nto have a place to meet\nso many like-minded\npeople who also felt that\nour current system is\nincredibly unjust, and to\norganise campaigning\nefforts together in the\n2017 General Election.\nTwo years on, I am now\nit\u2019s President.\nLooking back to last\nweek; I had never been\nto a political party conference before and was\nunsure of what to expect.\nWould it just consist of\nlong and boring discussions about the minute\ndetails of some obscure\npolicy? 13,000 people,\nincluding hundreds of\nYoung Labour members,\nwere descending on Liverpool, so I knew it had to\nbe more than just that.\nPolicy was indeed\ndiscussed and debated, in\na packed conference hall\nfull of thousands of CLP\n(Constituency Labour\nParty) and trade union\ndelegates. This is the\ncentre of the Conference,\nas Labour under Jeremy\nCorbyn has been increasingly trying to become a\nmember-led party where\nordinary people like you\nand me have influence\nover the policies that\na Labour Government\nwould adopt. This gradual\ndemocratisation of the\nParty is clearly winning\nover swing voters: in the\n2017 General Election,\nLabour, with its brave and\ntransformative manifesto,\ngained the largest increase\nin vote share since 1945.\nThese policies are winning\nthe debate because they\u2019re\nbeing crafted by ordinary\npeople, many of whom\nhave directly suffered the\nconsequences of austerity\nunder the Tories for the\nlast 8 years.\nWhile debating and\nmaking important policy\ndecisions for the next\nLabour government is\nincredibly important, it\u2019s\nthe fringe events where\nConference truly shines.\nThese include panel\ndiscussion, Q&As, and\ninterviews with Labour\npoliticians and activists,\nand are hosted by all\nsorts of associated organisations in the Conference\nvenue. Outside the venue,\na fringe politics, arts,\nand music festival called\nThe World Transformed\n(TWT) runs alongside the\nLabour Conference, now\nin its third year.\nUpon arrival at Liverpool on Saturday, we\ndecided to attend the\nrelaunch of Tribune\nmagazine, being hosted\nat TWT. Tribune is the\ntraditional magazine of\nfootball tournament. A\nfew years ago, it would\u2019ve\nbeen hard to believe that\nsuch events are running\nalongside a *political*\nconference, but a lot\nhas changed since then.\nPolitics is being reinvig-orated by a grassroots\nleft-wing movement, with\nmore and more ordinary\npeople getting involved\nevery single day and\njoining the half-a-million\nstrong membership of the\nLabour Party.\nPrime Minister in waiting?// Ansh Bhatnagar\nthe Labour left, with\ncontributors and editors\nincluding George Orwell,\nNye Bevan (founder of\nthe NHS), Barbara Castle\nand Michael Foot. Having\nfaded into obscurity\nearlier in the year, it was\nrelaunched with a bang,\nwith journalists such as\nOwen Jones and Dawn\nFoster contributing to the\nmagazine and speaking at\nthe event. The crowd had\na diverse mix of young\nand old, veterans of the\nmovement and those new\nto it.\nUpon looking at the\nschedule, we quickly\nrealised that TWT had\nmany incredibly diverse\nevents, from yoga sessions\nto reading groups, coding\nclasses to a 5-a-side\nWalking around the\nbustling Conference floor\nover the next few days\nmeant rubbing shoulders\nwith people I\u2019ve only seen\non TV before: people like\nEd Miliband, Owen Jones,\nDianne Abbott, John McDonnell, David Lammy,\nand many many more\ncommentators and poli-ticians. Due to this easy\naccess to the big names in\nthe Labour movement, we\ndecided to make a short\nvideo to promote LabourSoc. For busy people who\nhave their calendars full\nto the brim, they were\nincredibly approachable\nand kind enough to record\nthe video messages for us.\nBeing at Conference\nwasn\u2019t just about the\nLabour Party \u2013 it was also\n\u201c13,000\npeople,\nincluded\nhundreds of\nYoung Labour\nmebers, were\ndescending\ninto Liverpool\u201d\n\n"

They are calling on\nthe leaders of the FTSE\n350 (combining the FTSE\n100 and FTSE 250) to\nlearn from, support and\nbuy from social enterprises which are showing how\nwe can achieve equality\nthrough business.\nThis comes after it was\nannounced that recent\nresearch by Bloomberg\nfound, between 2007 and\n2017, black male graduates earned \u00a37000 less per\nyear than their white peers\non average, despite being\nmore likely to invest in\nhigher education. Black\nmale participation in\nhigher education has\nincreased by 24%, compared with a 15% rise\nfor white men. Research\nconducted by the Centre\nfor Crime and Justice\nStudies suggests that, regardless of gender, black\ngraduates are less likely\nto be employed after grad-uation. This could be due\nto inequalities in higher\neducation; black people\nare far less likely to\nreceive a good degree and\nmuch more likely to go to\nless prestigious universi-ties, which are both key\nbarriers to finding a well-paid graduate job.\nThe government\nbrought in the Race\nRelations Act in 1965 in\norder to protect ethnic\nless than half of young\npeople believe businesses\nbehave ethically and\nthat there is scepticism\ntowards businesses commitment to diversity and\ninclusivity.\npeople are looking for\nmore from their employ-ers.

They are set up to\ntrade for a social purpose\nand reinvest the majority of their profits back\ntowards meeting their\nsocial or environmental\nmission.

US stock\nmarkets have been more\nexpensive than now only\ntwice in history: Black\nTuesday of 1929, and the\nDot Com bubble of 2000.\nNeedless to say, both of\nthose bubbles burst in\nspectacular fashion, and\nnothing helps to inflate\na bubble like cheap-as-chips federal reserve\ndollar bills. What do I\nmean by an expensive\nstock market? The gold\nstandard for investors in\nterms of measuring the\nvalue of a company is the\nprice to earnings ratio, and\nthis is simply the market\ncapitalisation (number of\nshares x price) divided by\nthe profits of the company.\nAnd the cyclically adjusted profit to earnings ratio\nof the S&P500 (the value\nof the 500 largest companies in the US) is now (at\nthe time of writing) over\n32.9, double the 140-year\nmean of 16.6.\nAs I write this, the US\nstock market has just\nbroken the record for the\nlongest bull run in the\npost-war era. The start of\nthis bull run was in the\naftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, subsequently to which some may\nremember our governments throwing taxpayer\nmoney at failing banks.\nNow, it is not just taxpayer\nmoney that has fuelled the\nrise of the stock market.\nIn an attempt to quickly\ncover up the ineptitude of\na cronyistic government\nhailed \u2018end to boom and\nbust\u2019, the central banks\nof the world are handing\nout money practically for\nfree. Not to thee and me,\nof course; only to the institutions who have access\nto the inter-bank rate. The\nECB famously had its\ninterest rate at zero for a\nwhile, and even charged\nnegative interest rates for\ndepositing. This means\nthat people and businesses\nwith high net worth can\nuse the free money to\ninvest for themselves.\nThey create jobs and prosperity in the process of\ncourse, but interest rates\ncannot remain low forever,\nnot least because inflation\nstarts to rise. And recently\nwe see central banks\naround the world raising\nrates ever so slightly to\ncombat this. This will be\nthe needle that pops the\nbubble.\nIt is not just the manipulation of money\u2019s\nvalue by the independant\n(read \u2018unelected\u2019) central\nbanks that will send the\nstocks tumbling\u2026 Trump!\nYes, the namesake of the\n2016/17 \u2018Trump bump\u2019\nthat sent business confidence soaring with tax and\nregulation cuts will cause\nthe next great depression,\nless than two decades\nafter the last. Why? While\ntax and regulation cuts\nare generally good for\nbusiness in the short and\nmedium term, a government like the US cannot\nceaselessly reduce its tax\ntake without cutting down\na little on some of the\nfrivolous expenses like\ntheir huge armed forces,\ngiant border walls and\nhush money to prostitutes.\nOk that last one wasn\u2019t\ntechnically the government but I can\u2019t think\nof anything else on the\norder of walls and guns to\ncomplain about right now.\nSo yeah, the government\nwill probably have to shut\ndown a few more times as\nthe chaps and chapesses\nat the top debate whether\nthey should continue to\nfund their debt problem\u2026\nwith more debt. And\neventually, both sides will\nhave to realise it is not\nsustainable.And there will\nbe a levelling. P/E ratios\nwill tumble back to usual\nlevels, stocks will crash\nand the bear will jump\nout of the window. But\none thing won\u2019t change:\nthe super rich will see this\ncoming and get out before\nyou, and lobby for their\ncentral bank friends to\npump out even more cash\nto dilute your cash wealth\nwhile inflating their stock\nwealth. And we will go\naround again and again\u2026.\nWhy we need zoos\nMaryna Volyshnya makes the argument for zoos in the modern day\nA\ns more species become\nincreasingly\ne n d a n g e r e d\nand face steep decline,\ntoday\u2019s zoos become the\nark, a reservoir of the\nworld\u2019s valuable animals\nduring the world-engulf-ing climatic warmth. As\nof 2018 the ZSL London\nand Whipsnade Zoos are\na home to almost 23,000\nanimals across over 800\nCOMMENT\nMaryna Volyshnya\nComment Writer\nspecies.\nMany argue that the\nquality of life of an animal\nis largely reduced when\nit is held in captivity.\nAlthoughthemovementof\nan animal in a zoo is more\nrestricted, a zoo animal\ndoes not suffer or die of a\ndrought or starvation, with\nthe zoo providing a varied\nhigh-quality diet. Unlike\nan animal in the wild, a\nzoo animal is in receipt of\ncontinuous medical atten-tion, meaning any injuries\nor illnesses it acquires\nare treated immediately,\nsparing the animal pain\nand irritation. Socially,\na zoo animal is not\nthreatened by poachers\nor predators and is less\nlikely to face complete\nostracism, bullying\nor infanticide. Highly\nspecialised animals or\nanimals which reproduce\nmore slowly, tend to\nevolve in relatively stable\nenvironments which are\nhighly affected by climate\nchange, a present-day\nproblem that we continue\nto forecast into the future.\nSadly, now, a zoo is more\ncapable of providing a\nfitting enriched habitat\nfor these animals than\nour own, previously\nall-providing, planet, so\ncharacterising a life that is\n\u2018free\u2019as one that is \u2018good\u2019,\nis a mistake in this case.\nIf you are worried about\nthe welfare of animals in\ncaptivity, while bad zoos\nshould not be overlooked,\nyour concerns should be\nfocused more towards the\nmany breeders, dealers,\nfarms and private owners\nwhich are in greater need\nof inspection and im-provement.\nWith most humans\ninhabiting urban areas,\na zoo is often the only\nplace to experience live\nanimals, as other natural\nsettings such as national\nparks tend to be less ac-cessible. Zoos educate the\npublic and foster an appreciation of the animals and\na motivation to protect\nthem, with zoo visitors\nsupporting the zoos\u2019 conservation work financially\nby donating and adopting\nanimals and through direct\nvolunteer work. Pro-environmental behaviours are\nalso actively promoted\nto the visitors through\nmovements such as the\nZSL-led #OneLess which\nis reducing the number\nof London\u2019s plastic water\nbottles entering the ocean\nand championing a new\nrefill culture.\nAs there is no moral\nlaw outside social law,\nethics are part-subjective\nso keeping animals under\nmanaged care will always\nbe an ethical dilemma.\nHaving said that, during\nthe era of the Anthropocene, the ultimate\nethical dilemma faced\nby humanity is about the\npursuit of a sustainable relationship with our planet.\nWith strong evidence\nexisting for the effectiveness of zoos in saving\nanimals and increasing\npublic knowledge and\nawareness about the wild,\nmaybe zoos is how we\nreconnect humans to the\nultimate responsibility\nand purpose we have\nwhich is caring for our\nplanet?\n\n"

Many\nof her colleagues thought\nshe was exaggerating\nor over-sensationalising\nthese problems.\nIn response to this,\nHirsi Ali approached the\nminister of justice, Piet\nDonner, to register how\nmany honour killings\ntook place in Holland\neach year. He agreed to\na \u2018pilot project\u2019 where\nthey examined two (out\nof a possible twenty-five)\npolice regions. Between\nOctober 2004 and May\n2005, in just those two\nregions, eleven Muslim\ngirls were killed by\ntheir families. That was\nmore than one a month.\nParliament was shocked.\nFor these girls, just being\nseen with a boy, especially a Dutch boy, was\na death sentence. Now,\nhonour-related homicides\nin Holland are registered\nas such.\nA common running\nthread in Infidel is the\npower of belief. Hirsi\nAli was brought up a\ndevout Muslim, wearing\nfull-body Islamic dress at\nschool, and describes in\ngreat detail her slow and\narduous personal journey\nin leaving Islam. She\nmade the journey moving\nfrom the world of faith\nto the world of reason,\nfrom religious dogma to\nEnlightenment values,\nfrom the world of forced\nexcision and marriage\nto the world of sexual\nfreedom. She writes in\nthe epilogue to Infidel:\n\u201cHaving made that\njourney, I know that one\nof those worlds is simply\nbetter than the other.\u201d\nShe is a fascinating,\nbrilliant woman, and is\nnow a true hero championing women\u2019s rights,\nhuman rights, and liberal\nvalues. She founded The\nAHA Foundation in 2007,\nwhich aims to protect\nwomen and girls in the\nU.S. from harmful Islamic\ncultural practices such as\nfemale genital mutilation,\nhonour violence, and\nforced marriage.\nDespite her hugely\npositive influence on the\nworld, some Westerners\nstill refuse to listen to\nher views on Islam, and\nMuslims around the world\nhave called for multiple\nfatwas on her head. Fears\nfor her life reached a\nstartling reality following\nher collaboration with the\nDutch filmmaker Theo\nvan Gogh, and his subsequent murder in 2004.\nAyaan Hirsi Ali // David Sandison\nBOOKS\nFRIDAY, 5TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\n\u201cShe wanted to\nput the plight\nof Muslim\nwomen on\nthe political\nagenda,\nand address\nproblems of\nintegration\namong\nimmigrants\u201d\n\n"

Hence\nit makes sense for a VC\nfirm to proceed to more\nunderdeveloped, under-served markets to unearth\nand polish hidden gems\nthat may, given time and\nguidance grow into the\nnext Facebook or Uber.\nSoutheast Asia, or more\nspecifically the ASEAN\nregion is one of these\nregions. Demographics\nis a key reason this small\nregion might soon be\nmore attractive to invest\nin than others. With a\ngrowing population of\n644.1 million, with 70%\nunder the age of 40, a\nlarge workforce and\nconsumer base remains\nto be harnessed (We are\nSocial, 2017). The region\nis poised to leapfrog even\nChina in terms of tech\nadoption, with internet\nusers making up 53%\nof the Southeast Asian\npopulation. Southeast\nAsia is projected to be the\nfastest growing internet\nmarket, rivalled only by\nIndia. This is fueling a\nbooming e-commerce\nsector which has produced at least 2 unicorns,\nnamely the Lazada Group\nand Tokiopedia, both of\nwhich were subject to\ninvestments of more than\n$1 billion by the Alibaba\nGroup.\nGeography might also\ncontribute to the rise of\nSEA\u2019sstartupscene.Being\nin proximity to key trade\nroutes and key Asian financial centers, the region\nis a prime destination for\ntechnology giants and\ninternet players. Investors\nhave already poured\nmouthwatering amounts\nof cash into the region\u2019s\nmost promising startups\nacross a diverse range of\nverticals, from logistics\nto gaming. With the trade\nwar ongoing, some firms\nhave opted to relocate\nproduction to Southeast\nAsia (Bloomberg, 2018),\nwhich will boost local\neconomies and stimulate\ngrowth. These efforts are\nyielding fruit, notably in\nthe form of 10 unicorns,\nwith most based in Indonesia, the region\u2019s largest\nmarket. This might be a\nsmall number compared\nto its counterparts in\nlarger economies, but\nthe potential for growth\nis large. VC funds in the\nregion, especially early\nstage funds are facing\nincreasingly stiff compe-tition. Big players such\nas Sequoia Capital have\nmade venture investments\ninto the region, facing off\nagainst smaller regional\nfunds (TechCrunch,\n2018).\nThe future is bright for\nSoutheast Asia. However,\nsome challenges remain,\nsuch as the lack of unified\nregulations and fragmented markets, with diverse\nconsumer patterns taking\nhold in different nations.\nPotential political instability might also spook\ninvestors, but with many\nparts of the world facing\nsimilar upheavals it might\nbe a risk investors are\nwilling to take.\nDespite the ongoing trade war tensions in Asia, there is large growth potential for startups as venture capital\nfirms eye up the region.\nSnapshot of the region\u2019s key digital statistical indicators // Wearesocial\nINVESTMENT\nFRIDAY, 5TH\nOCTOBER, 2018 FELIX\nicu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\n35\nSoutheast Asia favoured by US firms // Bloomberg\n\u201cThe region\nis a prime\ndestination\nfor technology\ngiants\u201d\n\n"

After reciting\nthe \u2018Sura Fatiha\u2019 (which\nevery Muslim is required\nto recite first, at every\nprayer), the central actress,\nrather than bowing down,\nraises her head. Through\nher, the four Muslim\nwomen\u2019s stories are told.\nOne woman has been\nflogged for falling in love.\nAnother laments being\nforced to submit sexually\nto her husband, whom\nshe was also forced to\nmarry, for the Qu\u2019ran\nsays: \u201cWhen your wives\nhave purified themselves,\nye may approach them\nin any manner, time or\nplace.\u201d The third woman\nis beaten by her husband\nat least once a week.\nAnd the final is a young\ngirl, confined to her own\nhome, who has been\nraped by her uncle. She is\nnow pregnant and will be\npunished for having sex\noutside marriage.\nBy creating the film,\nHirsi Ali wanted to make\nit difficult for people to\nturn a blind eye to this\nproblem. She wanted\nWesterners to stop\ndeluding themselves that\nIslam is only about peace\nand tolerance. She wanted\nto illustrate that the punishment and oppression\nof women is mandated in\nthe Qu\u2019ran, and it is not\nsimply a gendered issue.\nThe Qu\u2019ran legitimises\nculpable males\u2019 actions\nso that they feel no shame\nand aren\u2019t challenged by\ntheir conscience or their\ncommunity. The strict interpretation of the Qu\u2019ran\ncauses intolerable misery\nfor women. All feminists\nshould be outraged by\nthis.\nI list some clarifying\nstatements here. Firstoff, there is a difference\nbetween Muslims the\npeople, and Islam the\nbelief system. It is\nnobody\u2019s intention to\ndemonise a group of\npeople by pointing out\nflaws in the belief system.\nA belief system, like any\nset of ideas, should be\nopen to critical inquiry.\nSecondly, Muslims are\nnot one particular race,\nand Islam is most certainly\nnot a race, so its criticism\nis by definition not racist.\nThirdly, not all ways\nof living are equal, and it\nis not bigoted to question\ndifferences between\nWestern and Islamic\nculture that incur undue\nsuffering, especially\ntowards women.\nHowever, Western\nfeminists appear to have\nmisplaced their priorities,\nas have many liberal\nelites. Throughout Infidel,\nHirsi Ali makes it clear\nthat various specific tenets\nof Islam are antithetical to\nmodern civil society (as\nhave many others, including Sam Harris, Douglas\nMurray, and Christopher\nHitchens, for example).\nBut anyone who states\nthis fact, however well-in-tentioned, is often swiftly\nmet with accusations of\nracism and bigotry. This\nis not a helpful response\nif we wish to make\nprogress on this issue.\nIt is, apparently, now\nof more importance for\nWesterners to hide behind\na shallow pretence of\ntolerance, than it is to look\nhonestly at this real clash\nof cultures. Tolerance is\nAyaan Hirsi Ali is the founder of AHA Foundation, which promotes liberty for all // AHA Foundation\nThey had created a\nshort, 10-minute, artistic\nfilm titled Submission:\nPart One.

The American\nMidwest\u2019s breeziest\nindie rock band have\nnot shied away from the\npressure though, and have\njust released a record\nthat \u2013 despite not being a\nbig departure from their\nprevious work \u2013 offers\na sound more solemn\nand themes even further\ngrounded in meaningful\nstories from the everyday\nthan before.\nAfter announcing the\nalbum, frontman Jake\nLuppen explained that\nthe album\u2019s overarching\ntheme \u2013 an exploration\nof toxic masculinity and\nthe reasons behind it,\nwas largely influenced by\nthe #MeToo movement.\nA quick glimpse at the\ntracklist, which is, bar\ntwo songs, made up of\none-word titles, gives\na good idea of what\nthe album is about.\n\u2018Mistakes\u2019, \u2018Anxious\u2019,\n\u2018Doubt\u2019 and \u2018Bambi\u2019 are\nintrospective snapshots\nof a man trying to find\nsolid ground in society.\nEach song is a confession\nfull of feeling, all of them\nstrung together to make an\nalbum that promises hope\nfor those who can can\nrelate to Bambi\u2019s story.\nThe psyche of the\nalbum\u2019s lyrical subject is\none grounded in confusion and insecurity. The\nopener, \u2018Mistakes\u2019, is a\nbiblical premonition of\nwhat is to come. \u201cForbidden like a fruit and I\u2019m the\nsnake / Just a bite, I wanna\nknow the taste\u201d relates\nthe mistakes yet to be\ndivulged throughout the\nalbum to the original sin.\nTaking on this mindset,\nit feels as though every\nslip-up that the character\nsuffers is a must, a prerequisite for understanding\nwhat is good and what is\nright \u2013 first you must take\na bite. But the last words\noffered up by the excellent\nalbum closer \u2018Passenger\u2019\n(\u201cIf I ever became the\nthings we lost, the things\nwe left behind / I would\nwish for the past when\nwe were pure, suffering\nintertwined\u201d) suggest\nthat perhaps the original\nsin is not necessary. That\nbiting into the apple of\nbeing whatever society\ndeems to constitue a man,\na paradigm which spews\nbouts of toxicity from the\nrepressed feelings it drags\nalong with, may not be\nnecessary; maybe Bambi\nwishes he could go back\nto being pure, living once\nagain blissfully with his\nEve in the garden of Eden.\nWhile the main idea of\nthe album rings good, and\nmany of the songs live up\nto it, that is not the case\nfor all of them. The long\nintro (\u2018Sun Veins\u2019) on\nLandmark was one of the\nhighlights of the album,\nand \u2018Mistakes\u2019 follows in\nits path as a synthier and\nhazier cousin. \u2018Anxious\u2019\nmay not be as explosive\nas Landmark\u2019s \u2018Way It\nGoes\u2019, but waiting for\nJake\u2019s godly tenor to\nfinally spread its wings\nhalfway through the song\nis incredibly rewarding.\nThe title track is probably\nthe best song on the album\nand key to understanding\nit. \u201cI swear to god I wasn\u2019t\nborn to fight / Maybe\njust a little bit, enough to\nmake me sick of it\u201d is a\ngreat indictment of toxic\nmasculinity, how a man\ncan feel forced into a role\nof an aggressor due to\nexternal pressures. It must\nbe said though, that by the\nmiddle of the album some\nof the impetus is lost and\ntoo much of the lyrics are\nspent on Bambi feeling\nsorry for himself due to\nfuckups that are now in\nthe irretrievable past. \u201cI\u2019m\nsorry, I\u2019m sorry, I suck, I\nsuck..\u201d interrupts the false\nbeginning of \u2018Honestly\u2019.\nWe get it, thank you for\nopening up, but your\nself-analysis could have\ngone deeper, Bambs.\nThe album is a noteworthy follow up to their\ndebut. Compliments\nall round for how well\nthought out the idea of the\nironically-named Bambi\nis, but some of the hooks\nsound lazy and the bouncy\ndrums and Jake\u2019s voice\nwill not carry this album\nthrough as seemlessly as\nthe first. A valiant effort\nnonetheless.\nFresh albums: Thee Oh Sees, Gregory Alan Isakov\nThe new Isakov\nalbum is out\ntoday...\nAnd I haven\u2019t listened to\nit yet because I\u2019m writing\nthis piece on a Wednesday.\nBut it\u2019s spawned enough\nsingles to be recommended\nto me on Spotify anyhow as\nan EP, \u201cDark, Dark, Dark,\u201d\nafter the lead single on the\nalbum. And boy howdy, isn\u2019t\nhe dreamy?\nIsakov has produced virtually nothing but classics\nin his fifteen-year career.\nHe\u2019s a man of many tal-ents, from the sparseness on\n\u201cRust-Colored Stones\u201d to\nthe jangly marches of \u201cThis\nEmpty Northern Hemisphere,\u201d featuring langorous\nfiddles and a profound sense\nof peace and tranquility.\nIn between, there\u2019s been\nall sorts - splashy piano,\nwarm bass hums, and glorious noise-walls, distort-ed, looming, carrying the\nmelody in the background\nwhile the mandolin in the\nforeground holds a pick pat-tern. For a guy with such a\ndistinctive sound, he really\ngoes all over.\nThese new singles are\npretty great. There\u2019s a hint\nof Bon Iver in the falsetto reprise on \u201cChemicals\u201d;\n\u201cDark, Dark, Dark\u201d recalls\nOld Crow Medicine Showstyle country with a lurching,\ncadence, and \u201cCaves\u201d has an\nabsolutely delightful indie\nlo-fi vibe - this vibe gives\nway to a delightful climax\nwith the reprise \u201cLet\u2019s put all\nthese words away.\u201d The right\nnotes of wist, melancholy,\nand nostalgia are hit.\nSo, to sum up: Isakov\nhasn\u2019t missed before, and\nthere\u2019s no indication that\nhe\u2019ll miss this time. Cop the\nalbum.\nThee Oh Sees\ngoes prog-metal\nwith Smote\nReverser, claims\nPitchfork. Thee\nOh Sheesh.\nFirst: Wikipedia lists\nthem as Oh Sees, and Spotify as Thee Oh Sees. Take\nyour pick, my dudes.\nI can\u2019t believe I missed\nthis album last week. Thee\nOh Sees is an experimental\ngarage-rock outfit well familiar to Music Section adherents with a flair for the\ngrungy and atmospheric.\nTheir old stuff is very de-sert/stoner rock; as Pitchfork\nsays, after the rough patches\nthey hit in 2013 or so as a\nband, John Dwyer took the\nchance to reform, and the\nnew double-drummer ensemble is definitely distinct\nin sound from their older\nstuff.\nThere are lots of great\ndrum patterns on here, and\nlots of nice jams that zig-zag\naround in feel with glee.\nWhile it\u2019s true that the\u2019re\ngenerally stepping on the\ntoes of the prog metal fanbase a bit more with this\nalbum, this album might\nnot appreciate people looking for stuff in the vein of\ndjent or whatever you kids\nare calling prog nowadays If\nyou\u2019re a fan of letting atmospheric rock ride, you\u2019ll like\nthis album.\nI stuck my headphones on\nCharlie\u2019s head (shoutout to\nthe Comment Section) for a\nsecond opinion and he thinks\nthey sound grand. So cop\nthis too.\nTim Hecker\u2019s\ntriumphant\nreturn with\nKonoyo.\nTim Hecker is probably\nbest known for his masterpiece work Harmony in Ultraviolet, which has topped\nmany a list of the best ambient albums of all time. Others might know Ravedeath,\n1972; yet another classic.\nHis palette has shifted\nslightly; most of the instrumentation on this album\nis old-style Japanese stuff,\nwith the samples recorded\nover a week in a Buddhist\ntemple in Tokyo.\nThere are harsh starts and\nstops, wonderful grating\ndrones, and an ominous robotic madness to the entire\npiece. This is nothing less\nthan a return to form for one\nof the greatest living ambient artists.\nPar for the course, Hecker\nbuilds staggering, spacious\nlandscapes, allows them to\ndecay into discordant noise,\nand revitalizes them - pulling back out into fresh surges of harmonic peace.\nAnd that, lads, is your\nweekly listening.\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Hippo Campus.\nLabel: Transgressive\nRecords.

    "content": "The Rise of Private Equity\nINVESTMENT\nTom Alston\nInvestment Editor\nEditor in Chief ICIS\nB\nefore the financial crisis,\nprivate equity\ni n v e s t o r s\nfollowed closely the\n\u201cbuyout\u201d manual pioneered by Henry Kravis\nand George Roberts\nwhen they founded the\nfirm KKR in the 1970\u2019s.\nEssentially, they would\nacquire companies whole,\nthen they would cut costs\nand load them with low\ninterest rate debt. For a\nwhile this was very suc-cessful. Earlier this year\nthe private equity firm\nBlackstone sold its 15.8\nmillion shares in Hilton\nWorldwide Holdings,\nbringing an end to an\n11-year relationship that\nended up as the most\nprofitable private equity\ndeal on record ($14 billion\nin profit meaning the firm\ntripled its investment).\nBlackstone took the hotel\nprivate in 2007, with\nthe firm putting up $6.5\nbillion of equity. The\nfirm later suffered during\nthe financial crisis but\nafter some more cash and\nrestructuring of Hilton\u2019s\ndebt, Blackstone took the\ncompany public again\nin 2013. The shares had\nmore than doubled at the\ntime of the sale. Despite\nthis, many critics said this\nmethod was comparable\nto cash-rich private equity\nfirms playing a risky game\nof musical chairs.\nNow the biggest firms,\nincluding Blackstone,\nhave changed course\njoining a new breed of\nlightly regulated \u201calternative\u201d money managers\nthat have filled the void\nas banks are forced to\nretreat from risky deals.\nUnlike mainstream banks,\nwhich are dependent on\ndeposits and short-term\nfunding, these funds raise\ncapital from long-term institutional investors such\nas insurance and pension\nfunds. They provide a\ncrucial source of credit,\nsometimes in very unconventional ways, for companies that have too much\nrisk to tap into the bond\nmarket. In 2013 Codere,\na Spanish gaming firm,\nfaced imminent bankrupt-cy. Its bonds were trading\nat just over half-face\nvalue. Blackstone offered\nit a cheap $100m loan,\nwith a catch. Blackstone\nhad bought credit derivatives on Codere\u2019s debt that\nwould pay out about $19\nmillion if they defaulted\non a bond payment. So\nCodere delayed a payment\nby a couple of days to\nprompt a \u201ctechnical\ndefault\u201d. Consequently,\nBlackstone got its pay-out\nand Codere lived to fight\nanother day. The investors\nwho sold Blackstone\ncredit derivatives had\nessentially bet that Codere\nwas going to live up to its\nbond payments. Without\nthe loan, that most likely\nwould have been the case\n\u201cBuyout\nvolumes were\nup 27% year\non year in\n2017 and can\nbe expected\nto accelerate\nthis year, with\na record $1.1\ntrillion pledge\u201d\nand those investors would\nstill have paid for their\nerror. Similarly, in 2017\nBlackstone bought $33\nmillion worth of credit\nderivatives on Hovnanian,\nan American construction\nfirm. It again offered\ncheap financing on the\ncondition that it trigger\nthose derivatives to pay\nout. One of the credit\ndefault swap sellers,\nSolus Asset Management,\na hedge fund, was denied\nan injunction to stop the\ntechnical default. Even\nthough America\u2019s Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission suggest\ntechnical default may\ncount as market manipu-lation, the company falls\nunder the Securities and\nExchange Commission,\nwhich has said nothing.\nCredit default swaps\nwere intended as a hedge\nagainst losses from\ndefaults, not a bet on\nwhether a firm defaults on\nits liabilities. However, it\nis this alternative thinking\nthat has led to private\nequity firms being so\nsuccessful. Funds are\nraising more capital than\nthey can spend. According to Thomson Reuters,\nbuyout volumes were up\n27% year on year in 2017\nand can be expected to\naccelerate this year, with\na record $1.1 trillion of\ncash pledged by inves-tors. \u201cThe private equity\nfundraising environment\nhas been extraordinary\u201d\nsays Alison Mass, global\nhead of the financial and\nstrategic investors group\nat Goldman Sachs. \u201cWe\nare in frequent dialogue\nwith our largest clients\nregarding targets in excess\nof $10 billion\u201d. The main\npropelling factor for the\nboom is the same one that\nfuelled the industry before\nthe 2008 crisis: cheap\ndebt and huge wall of\ncash caused by the huge\namounts of bond buying\nby the central banks,\nkeeping rates down. The\nsize of recent deals is\nbeginning to surpass those\npre-crisis peaks with\ncompanies increasing\ntheir dependence on debt\nfinancing.\nWhat is more worrying\nis with all this unspent\ncapital, private equity\nfirms are now beginning to\neye up buying banks. With\nBlackstone\u2019s \u20ac1 billion\npurchase last week of a\n60% stake in Luminor, a\nBaltic lender whose return\non equity lags behind\nmost other Nordic banks,\neconomists are worried\nthis marks the start of\na series of acquisitions.\nSince both sectors are\nhighly leveraged boosting\none with the other would\nbe a very bad idea, a clear\nexample being the spiralling levels of leverage that\ncaused the financial crash\na decade ago.\nSo should investors\nreturn to the asset management industry for\ncapital returns? Interestingly, Larry Fink who runs\nBlackRock (the world\u2019s\nlargest asset manager with\n$6 trillion of assets) was\nthe colleague of Stephen\nSchwarzman who runs\nBlackstone (the largest\nprivate equity firm),\nuntil the two companies\nsplit in 1995. Yet they\nboth have very different\nviews on investment and\nmanagement strategies.\nBlackRock stands for\ncomputing power, low\nfees and scale. It mainly\nsells passive funds\n(including ETFs) to institutions and the masses.\nMeanwhile, Blackstone\nrepresents a combination\nof brain power, high fees\nand specialisation. It uses\nleverage and changes\nin the management of\nfirms to make them more\nvaluable, clients being\nthe institutional and the\nrich. Measured by sales,\nprofits and cash returns to\nshareholders, BlackRock\nis on average 31% larger,\nraising seven times the\namount of net client\nmoney cumulatively\nover the past decade.\nAdditionally, BlackRock\nmade roughly $2.9 trillion\nof profits over the past 10\nyears compared with $202\nbillion for Blackstone\u2019s\nclients and BlackRock is\nvalued on 25 times profit,\nversus 11 for Blackstone,\nsuggesting that investors\nprefer its simple structure,\nthinking it will grow\nfaster. Having said this,\nthe passive funds BlackRock provide are highly\ncorrelated with the overall\nstock-market, faring well\nin the recent bull run on\nthe S&P 500, but a slight\ncrash may put the firm in\nserious trouble. As well as\nthis, although BlackRock\nhas swathes of power\nin corporate America,\nholding voting rights in a\nlarge number of large cap\ncompanies, the more it\nuses its power to influence\nthese firms, the more regulators will scrutinise it.\nThis is partly why\ninvestors are now seeking\nalternative investment\nstrategies, such as private\nequity firms. Even though\nasset managers can\nprovide stable returns, it\nis becoming harder and\nharder to generate alpha\n(gauges the performance\nof an investment against\na market index or benchmark which is considered\nto represent the market\u2019s\nmovement as a whole).\nTherefore, institutional\ninvestors are looking to\nmore creative schemes to\ngive them that edge. But\nyou can\u2019t beat the market\nforever.\nIs the private equity industry overinflated? // Financial Times\nISSUE 1699\nFELIX\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\n34\n\n"

Despite this,\ncommunities within\nimmediate proximity to\nbiodiversity hotspots continue to suffer the most\nfrom ecosystem changes\nand profit little economically from the natural\nresources being exploited.\nWhilst volunteering\nwith the Institute of Investigations of the Peruvian\nAmazon (IIAP), I was\nable to recognize the recurring disregard for these\ncommunities and their\nterritories by the state,\napparent in the traces of\nconflict, narcotrafficking\nand cultural erosion. Thus,\nit became evident that\nplanning the protection of\nwildlife should not only\nconsider natural spaces,\nbut the people who occupy\nthem, and offer fair and\nsustainable schemes to\nsupport their development\nin ways which reinforce\nthe management of the\nspecies.\nWhy protect at all?\nFor many, the most\ncompelling argument\nfor conservation is that\nhumanity itself depends\non ecosystems, for food,\nsoils and medicines, and\nthe regulation of climate,\nwater quality, diseases,\nflooding, and waste.\nBut to many indigenous\ncommunities these spaces\nrepresent more. In the\nAmazonian cosmovision,\nthe relationship of a community with its territory\n(not \u201cland\u201d) is conceived\nin terms of a collective\nright which recognizes\ninterdependence with\nnature.\nIn recent years, these\nsame communities have\ncome together forming\norganizations in defence\nof indigenous rights.\nDuring late August of\nthis year, a convention for\nindigenous groups took\nplace in Iquitos, Peru,\nwhere leaders discussed\ntheir place as self-con-scious actors in modern\nday problems - especially\nas observers of rainforest\ndestruction. The event\nhighlighted the awareness\nand desire for cooperation\nwith the goal of protecting\nthe natural world.\nAt the same time, the\nAmazonian population\nhas faced invasion and\nimposition from extrac-tive industries. According\nto RAISG, between\n2003 and 2013 oil and\ngas industry concessions\nincreased across the\nPeruvian Amazon from\n15% to over 80%, and over\n66% of this area overlaps\nwith indigenous territo-ries. In 2005, Argentinian\nmultinational PlusPetrol\ndiscarded over 1.1 million\nbarrels of toxic waste into\nfour rivers in the Northern\nPeru, which coincidently\npass through the ancestral\nlands of the Anchuar,\nQuechua, Kichwa and\nKukama Kikamiria\ncommunities, affecting\ntheir health and having a\ndevastating impact on fish\nand other animals vital for\ntheir livelihood.\nForestry in Peru continues to be a principal\ncause of degradation\nand new legislation has\nfailed to minimize the\nimpact, instead driving\nconcession holders to\nextract wood illegally\nfrom protected areas and\nadvancing conservation\nprojects. The knowledge\nof local hunters who frequently travel the region\nmay be paramount in the\napproximation of population sizes of threatened\nspecies and at the same\ntime, education on threats\nand the importance of\nwildlife to the ecosystem\nand the community\u2019s own\nfuture may prompt them\nto partake in its protection.\nAnother exemplary\nproject by the IIAP currently underway is the\nmanagement of hunted\nungulates, such as the\ncollared peccary (Pecari\ntajacu) and the white\nlipped peccary (Tayassu\npecari), both species in\ndecline in the Peruvian\nAmazon. These are used\nby communities for subsistence and commercial\nsale. The objective of the\nproject is to monitor the\npopulation through the\nhunter\u2019s data, implement\nquotas and remove intermediaries who purchase\nthe meat from the hunters\nat a minimal price and\nsell it for much more,\ntherefore allowing the\ncommunity to benefit\nsignificantly more.\nAs these cases high-light, there are critical\nsocial aspects to conservation and ignoring them\ncan lead to restrictions\nin a project\u2019s success.\nTackling the real causes\nof biodiversity decline\nis a tremendous task and\none which may only be\nachieved through consciousness and coopera-tion.\nConservation of this is worthwhile // Flickr\nindigenous territories and\nblank it with legal shares\nto avoid detection. This\nactivity is pernicious to\nwildlife, especially to\nendemic species sensitive to slight population\nchanges. It has also led\nto conflict; communities\nwho have denounced\nillegal logging activities\nhave been subject to death\nthreats and even murders.\nSome successful conservation models have\nemerged and may serve as\nexamples for the future.\nFrequently, these involve\nthe incentivisation of\nwildlife management\nthrough the generation of\nlocal social and economic\nbenefits. For example, in\nearly 2000s a management project in Guyana\nbegan training local fishermen to survey Arapaima\n(Arapaima gigas) populations \u2013 a large and highly\nprized freshwater fish. It\nwas clear that action was\nneeded as populations\nwere dwindling and close\nto a local extinction. The\nproject created fishermen\ngroups, implemented\na harvesting ban and\nintroduced aquarium\nfish cultivations as an\nalternative livelihood. In\naddition, they led several\ncommunity education and\nawareness campaigns.\nTechnical reports from\nthe following years\ndemonstrated an increase\nin Arapaima populations,\nwith the fishermen stating\nthat their main motivations included a change\nin attitude, availability of\nalternate fish and a desire\nto access future benefits\nthrough the project.\nEducation and information exchange are crucial\nin gaining the support of\nlocal communities and\n\n"

However, if\na cheeky solution that\nevaded Riemann\u2019s rule\nwas found in the next\n10 trillion, we would\ndisprove the hypothesis.\nshare a lot of scepticism\nabout Atiyah\u2019s attempt.\n\u201cThe proof just stacks\none impressive claim on\ntop of another without\nany connecting argument\nor real substantiation,\u201d\ncommented John Baez, a\nCalifornian mathematical\nphysicist. The doubt of\nfellow mathematicians\nincreased after Atyiha\u2019s\npresentation at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum,\nbecause he focused on the\nhistory and importance of\nthe Riemann\u2019s hypothesis,\nrather than the details of\nthe proof.\nNumerous failed\nattempts to prove\nRiemann\u2019s hypothesis, its\nimportance, as well as the\n$1 million prize may mean\nthat Atiyah might have to\nwait months or even years\nto get his proof verified,\nbut if this happens, the\nalready esteemed Atiyah\nwill become a true legend.\nSCIENCE\nPaulina Rowinska\nScience Writer\n\u201cSome\nimportant\nmathematical\npapers are\nvalid only\nunder the\nassumption\nthat Riemann\nhypothesis\nholds\u201d\n\u201cA solution\nthat evaded\nRiemann\u2019s rule\nwould mean\nhis hypothesis\nmust be\ndisproved.\u201d\nSir Michael Atiyah is a Fields Medalist and Abel Prize winner//Wikimedia\nThe Riemann Zeta function//Wikimedia\nScience writer Paulina Rowinska delves into the unpredictable world of prime numbers and describes why an\nexplanation for their occurence would be such an important breakthrough in mathematics.\nTherefore, the proof must\ninvolve much more than\njust manual checking.\nMany hundreds\nhave tried and failed.\nDid Atiyah really find\nthe secret to proving\nRiemann\u2019s hypothesis?

    "content": "American Animals and the Hazards of Adaptation\nFollowing on from Film Editor Sung Soo Moon\u2019s review of American Animals in last week\u2019s issue of Felix, fellow\nFilm Editor , Aidan Chan, gives his take\nFILM\nAidan Chan\nFilm Editor\nA\nm e r i c a n\nAnimals, directed by Bart\nLayton, is about\nthe real-life story of 4\nyoung adults, Spencer\n(Barry Keoghan), Warren\n(Evan Peters), Eric (Jared\nAbrahamson) and Chas\n(Blake Jenner) who\ndecided to steal several\nbooks of extremly high\nvalue, including The Birds\nof America and On the\nOrigin of Species, from\nthe library at Transylvania\nUniversity.\nDirector Bart Layton,\na frequenter of docu-mentaries, decided to\nintersperse the story with\nfootage of interviews with\nthe real perpetrators of the\nheist and other involved\npeople. This rather unorthodox direction proves\nto be one of the film\u2019s\nmost thought-provoking\naspects.\nHowever, before that,\nhere is everything else\nthat worked for the film.\nThe acting across the\nfour main stars, Keoghan,\nPeters, Abrahamson and\nJenner, are uniformly\npowerful, particularly\nduring the explosive\nthird act where we get\nto observe the might of\nMurphy\u2019s law playing in\nreal-time. Despite a rather\nslow start, I was on the\nedge of my seat for the\nentiretyofthesecond-half,\nand very majorly due to\nthe intense performances\nfrom the actors. Evan\nPeters especially made\nme finally appreciate his\nrange, as I mostly knew\nhim as the semi-comic\nrelief role of Quicksilver\nin two previous X-Men\nfilms. The amount of\nhorror and desperation he\nconveyed was astounding\nand truly affecting.\n\u201cEvan Peters\nespicially\nmade me\nfinally\nappreciate his\nacting range\u201d\n\u201c...what the\nfilmmaker\ndecides to\ninclude (or\nexclude)\ndirectly\ninfluences\nhow viewers\nview, and\nlearn from, an\nevent\u201d\nThe film starts with a\nvery noticeable statement:\nThis is not based on a true\nstory, this is a true story.\nThis statement is not\none that can be thrown\naround lightly, because it\nimplies that the film has\ntaken no creative licenses\nand is essentially - true.\nHowever, from the get-go,\nthe film contradicts itself\non this statement already\nby introducing unreliable\nnarratives. And so, the\naccuracyoftheadaptation,\nand even the authenticity\nof the interviews, come\nunder question.\nIntentionally or not,\nthis film becomes a kind\nof commentary on the\nprocess of adaptation\nitself. This is important\nbecause adaptations, and\nfilms in general, can be\nvery manipulative. Simple\nchanges of the original\nmaterial (event, book\netc.) can already convey a\nwildly different message.\nThe original story of\nMulan was never about\nfemale empowerment,\nit was about patriotism\nand filial piety. So, what\nthe filmmaker decides\nto include (or exclude)\ndirectly influences how\nviewers view, and learn\nfrom, an event. Not all\nfilms have an agenda, but\nall films are subjective.\nAnd we, as relatively\npassive recipients of said\nsubjectivity, must choose\nfor ourselves what to take\nin, and what not to.\nAmerican Animals // IMDb\nISSUE 1699\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n18\n\u201cNot all films\nhave an\nagenda, but\nall fims are\nsubjective\u201d\nhand, the protagonists\nare portrayed as very\nsympathetic. Their desire\nto escape their mundane\n(college) lives and their\neventual regret, seem to\nbe an attempt to justify\nthe heist. However, the\nfilm also showed the\nprotagonists intentionally harming Betty Jean\nGooch, the librarian, in an\nintense sequence. Should\nwe therefore condemn the\nfour perpetrators of the\nheist for their immorality,\nor should we instead sympathize with their regret\nand their ability to grow\nas human beings (they\nsoundedveryapologeticin\nthe interviews)? American\nAnimals leaves this open\nfor contemplation. Having\nsaid that, I feel like the\nfilm tends to suggest the\nlatter. When the mournful\nmusic sounds, accompanying the tears of the\nreal-life Spencer as he\nvoices out his immense\nThe aforementioned\ndocumentary method used\nby director Bart Layton\nis strikingly refreshing.\nHaving the real-life\npeople involved in the\nheist to express themselves directly in the film\nwas a great, albeit a little\nbit lazy, way of letting the\naudience sympathise with\nthem very quickly. It also\nallows the audience to understand the psychology\nand reasons behind their\nactions (and reactions)\nin the most direct way.\nSimultaneously, this\nblending of documentary\nand film also leaves a lot\nof questions hanging after\nthe credits are rolled.\n\u201cThis rather\nunorthodox\ndirection\nproves to be\none of the\nfilm\u2019s most\nthought-provoking\naspects\u201d\nAmerican Animals\nleaves this quite open for\ninterpretation. On the one\nregret in a poignant finale,\nit becomes really, really\ndifficult to dislike the\nfour protagonists, even\nafter witnessing them\ntraumatize an innocent\nmiddle-aged librarian\nand jeopardize invaluable\nartifacts.\n\n"

The\nrest is history.\u201d\nand Charlie\u2019s freshly\ncaught crab). Such exotic\ncuisines placed them way\nahead of ULU who stuck\nto the standard grub after\nweekly trainings: pasta\nand tomato sauce.\nHowever, the friendly\nrivalry between the clubs,\nusually demonstrated at\nthe annual BUSA competitions reached new\nheights when the club set\ntheir eyes on ULU\u2019s \u00a350\ninflatable duck.\nA cunning plan to\nkidnap the duck was\ndevised by Aidan (demon-strating noteworthy commodore characteristics)\nand Nick. They decided\nto hold Toby as hostage\non the duck\u2019s boat as a\nmethod of distraction for\nits crew. In the mean-while, they paddled it to\nthe boat and later rescued\nToby in a tender. The next\nday they named the duck\nHoisin. The rest is history.\nOver the course of a\nweek, they sailed to Iggy\nCreek, Lakka, Gaios,\nParga and Plataria and\nspent the nights exploring the local bars and\nclubs. In between islands\nthey stopped to swim\nand snorkel, sipped on\nouzo (blending with the\nlocals) and enjoyed nau-tical-themed music such\nas \u2018Reggae Shark\u2019, which\nwas heavily endorsed by\nRory, Nick and Aidan.\nOne morning at 6am,\nToby sailed the team to\nthe stunning Emerald Bay.\nIn an attempt to top the\nprevious day\u2019s crab catch,\nsome of the crew tried\nspear fishing with a rod\nand a kitchen knife tied\nto the end, whilst Radhika\nfound the tranquillity of\nthe bay perfect to recover\nfrom a bad hangover.\nSuddenly, schools of\nfish came rushing towards\nus, and the spear-fishers\nwere ready to go in for\nthe kill, but Fraser and\nCharlie soon realised that\nthe schools\u2019 arrival coincided with the hangover\nvictim\u2019s tactical chunder\nhaving been flushed into\nthe sea. Certain that these\nfish would not be as appe-tising as they had hoped,\nthe mission was aborted.\nTheir final stop was\nPlataria. After a tiresome\nweek of skippering around\nGreece and being held\nhostage at the expense of\nan inflatable duck, Toby\nwent for a much deserved\nrelaxing swim, but was\ntragically stung by a jel-lyfish.\nThankfully they had\nmedic freshers Lily,\nCharlie and Oliver on\nboard, who assured him\nthat \u201cpeeing on it probably\nwon\u2019t work\u201d and Calvin\u2019s\nsecond year of medical\nschool knowledge led him\nto the conclusion that a tea\ntree oil ointment was the\nbest solution (which was\nsurprisingly effective).\nRejuvenated by the\nnatural treatment, Toby\nstole all of ULU\u2019s flags\nand hoisted another one of\ntheir inflatables, a golden\nswan, onto their mast.\nOn the last morning,\nthey headed back to Corfu\nand stopped on the way\nto refuel, where Fraser\u2019s\ndocking manoeuvre\n(drift) impressed even the\nhead of the boat charter\ncompany.\nSadly, they had to part\nwithout Hoisin the Duck.\nIt was a well-deserved\nholiday made memorable\nwith great company, and\nthe club cannot wait for\nmore adventures in the\nyear ahead.\nThe club are very\nexcited to welcome new\nmembers and would love\nto introduce more people\nto sailing!\nYou can follow the\nSailing Club on social\nmedia and attend one of\ntheir fresher\u2019s events to\nget involved.\nNot a single duck in sight // ICSC\nISSUE 1699\nFELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40\nLooks like a lovely day for some spear-fishing // ICSC\n\n"

She takes her\nown life. But this isn\u2019t\nwhere her story ends. We\nencounter Alice on the\nmorgue slab, in her first\nmoments of \u2018death\u2019 as she\nrealises she is still here, a\nghost, watching her body\nand the people she has left\nbehind. This is the concept\nof Dust \u2013 a one-woman\nplay, written and performed by Milly Thomas,\nin a stark, stripped back,\nbare-bones production\nthat has transferred to\nLondon following an\naward-winning run at\nEdinburgh Fringe in 2017.\nAlice watches her\nfamily come to see her\nin the morgue and, even-tually, the reverberating\neffects of her death on her\nparents, brother, boyfriend\nand best friend, Ellie. This\nis interspersed with key\nmoments from Alice\u2019s\nlife: the day she started\ncontemplating death, the\nday Ellie tearfully pleads\nwith her to move back in\nwith her parents for her\nown good. We\u2019re taken\non a tour of moments that\nhelp us understand the life\nAlice was living prior to\ndeath, and how depression\nhad impacted her. Despite\nthis, there isn\u2019t an \u2018origin\nstory\u2019 for her depression,\nno abuse or trauma that\nexplains the source of\nher problems. This is\none of the best aspects\nof the writing in Dust. It\nrings true to the reality\nof depression as something often inexplicable.\nThomas keeps the focus\nclearly on the effects of\ndepression, rather than\nsearching for some elusive\ncause.\nAlice is witty and\nsharp, switching between\nfunny one-liners and stark\nemotional commentary.\nShe\u2019s frank, talking about\nher body, her desires, with\nan openness that borders\non the vulgar. It\u2019s clear\nthat Thomas is as skilled\na writer as she is a per\u201cDust isn\u2019t a\nplay that wants\nyou to watch\nit, it\u2019s one that\ndemands you\ngive yourself\nover and\nexperience it\nwhole\u201d\nformer. This doesn\u2019t mean\nthat Alice is likeable,\nthough, far from it. At\nher funeral her brother\nRobbie describes her as\n\u201cselfish\u201d, \u201cself-absorbed\u201d,\n\u201cthe kind of person who\nputs empty containers\nback in the fridge\u201d. This\nis perhaps one of the most\ninsightful parts of the play\nand one where it truly hits\nhome that Thomas has\ndrawn from real, lived ex-periences; the unpleasant\ntruth is that this is what\nmental illness can and will\ndo \u2013 bring out the worst in\nsomeone, the selfish, the\nself-obsessed, the destroyer of relationships. Alice\nis also immature. From\nthe context it\u2019s clear she\u2019s\na woman in her 20s, with\nuniversity well behind.\nBut her fascination with\nsex and her immature\nattitude to her boyfriend\nseems almost adolescent.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell if this is a\nflaw \u2013 the shock value of\na woman obsessed with\nsex and bodies, who talks\nabout it in the frankest of\nterms. Or is it a symptom\nof Alice\u2019s depression, a\npreviously vibrant and\nsexual woman who is now\nincapable of thinking of\nbodies in a way that is not\ncerebral, dominated by a\nmorbid fascination with\nthe most visceral aspects\nof human existence.\nThomas\u2019 writing doesn\u2019t\nreally make this clear and\nthat\u2019s a pity as it is really\nthe one thing in Dust that\nis occasionally jarring.\nMilly Thomas is\nfantastic, as Alice and as\neveryone around her. She\ntransitions seamlessly\nbetween characters,\nsomehow capturing the\nindividual essence of\neach one through tone of\nvoice or posture. There\nare moments when it\nbecomes confusing and\na little unclear who is\nspeaking, but surprisingly\nthis doesn\u2019t detract from\nthe play. It just makes\nthe moments and the\ncharacters bleed into each\nother in a way that puts us\ncloser to Alice\u2019s state of\nmind. Thomas is a master\nof accents and is faultless\nas Ellie, Alice\u2019s Scottish\nbest friend.\nThe production is\nflawless. The intimate\nspace ofTrafalgar Studios\u2019\nStudio Two is perfect for\nDust. The audience are\nmere feet from the action\nand it all feels so close and\nso visceral. This is perfect\nfor the subject matter, and\nfor the nature of the play\nas a one-woman entity.\nYou\u2019re so close to the\naction that there\u2019s no way\nto hide, to step away from\nits emotional impact. And\nyou don\u2019t want to. Dust\nisn\u2019t a play that wants you\nto watch it, it\u2019s one that\ndemandsyougiveyourself\nover and experience it\nwhole. Anne Reid\u2019s set is\nsimple: a stainless steel\nmorgue table, mirrors, and\nThomas, dressed only in a\nbodysuit, her hair pulled\nback in a tight ponytail.\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate\nthe impact of this pared\ndown set. It enhances\nthe intensity of Thomas\u2019\nperformance, and gives\nher the full attention of the\naudience.\nAs Thomas states in\nher closing speech to the\naudience, we are living\nin an epidemic of mental\nillness, with suicide, in\nparticular, impacting\nmore young people\nthan ever before. Dust\nis both illustration and\ncommentary of this and\nis certainly a must-watch,\nand not just for those who\nhave suffered the effects\nof mental illness, or those\neager to help struggling\nfriends; no, it is essential\nviewing in order to grasp\npart of our current cultural\nclimate. An emotional\nride, yes, but one that\u2019s\nvery much worth taking.\nMilly Thomas as Alice // Richard Southgate\nISSUE 1699\nFELIX\n27\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nGnanananthan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

According to\nwitnesses, the bus was\nracing with another bus\nto pick up passengers,\nbefore the driver lost con-trol. A further 12 school\nchildren were also injured\nas a result of the collision.\nThis tragic accident\nprompted students across\nDhaka to protest for safer\nroads, in a country where\nmore than 3,000 lives are\nlost per year in road traffic\naccidents.\nThe student protestors\nbrought the capital to\na standstill over the\nduration of a week,\ncreating checkpoints\nto inspect the driving\nlicenses of motorists\nand ensuring vehicles\nwere in a roadworthy\ncondition. Those who\nwere unable to produce\na valid license or car\nregistrations were\nhanded over to the\npolice. The Bangladeshi\ngovernment, intolerant\nof the protests, ordered\nthe students to cease\ntheir demonstrations.\nPrime Minister Sheikh\nHasina did not release\nan official statement\nbut advised students\nto stop protesting and\ngo back home, lest a\n\u2018third party\u2019 should\nsabotage the protests.\nHer warnings remained\nfutile as students were\ndetermined not to back\ndown.\nOn the 4th August,\nthe peaceful crowds\nof students chanting\n\u201cWe want justice\u201d\nwere met with violence\nfrom the police, who\nemployed tear gas and\nrubber bullets to injure\nover 100 youths. It\nwas also reported that\npro-government activists attacked the pupils\nwhilst demonstrating;\nalthough road transport\nminister Obaidul Quader\nrejected claims that the\nattackers had any affiliation with the governing\nAwami League Party.\nPolice also denied\nfiring rubber bullets\non the students despite\nlocal hospitals having\ntreated more than 115\nstudents that day, many\nwith injuries consistent\nwith rubber bullets.\nLocal journalists who\nattempted to film the\nscene were beaten up by\nmembers of the \u2018Bangladesh Chhatra League\u2019\n- a student organisation linked to Awami\nLeague who opposed\nthe protests. Reports of\nsexual assault and rape\nagainst young female\nprotestors also surfaced,\nbut further investigation\ninto these claims were\nprevented by police.\nAngered students\ncreated a charter of\n9 demands that they\nwanted the authorities\nto meet. One of them\nincluded exercising\ncapital punishment for\nthose found guilty of irresponsible driving. The\nconstruction of a foot\noverbridge or another\nalternative at the site\nof the accident was\nrequested as a means\nof ensuring students\u2019\nsafety. Moreover, basic\nregulations such as\npreventing buses from\ntaking excess passengers\non board were also mentioned in the list. Sheikh\nShafi, a student who had\nlost his brother in a road\ntraffic accident in 2015,\nsaid among the causes\nalso mentioned was the\nunderpayment of bus\ndrivers, which forced\nthem to work long hours\nand therefore could contribute towards reckless\ndriving. Student protestor Al Miran speaking to\nAFP news agency said,\n\u201cWe won\u2019t leave the\nroads until our demands\nare met.

Other analysts\nalso believe that the\nmass protests reflected\ndeeper frustration at\nan increasingly unaccountable government\noperating under Hasina.\nAlam informed the\ncourt that he had been\ntortured whilst in police\ncustody, but on the order\nof the Supreme Court,\nhe was taken to hospital\non the morning of 8th\nAugust; his remand\nhalted. However, he\nwas returned to police\ncustody at 2pm the same\nday.\nPrime Minister Sheikh\nHasina claimed the riots\nhad been instigated\nby her political rival\nKhaleda Zia; leader of\nthe Bangladesh National\nParty and former prime\nminister of Bangladesh.\nHasina accused Zia\nof spreading unrest\nas a means of inciting\npublic anger towards\nthe Awami League party\nahead of the general\nelections in December.\nZia denies the allega-tions. On the 6th August,\nin an attempt to address\nthe demands of students,\nThe Road Transport Act\n2018 was approved at a\ncabinet meeting, which\nproposed capital punishment for intentional\nkilling using a motor\nvehicle, and 5 years of\nprison for accidental\nkilling.\nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina // Wikimedia\n\u201cWe won\u2019t\nleave the\nroads until our\ndemands are\nmet\u201d\ndays, dozens of student\nprotestors were arrested\nby police and detained,\nbut no legal action was\ntaken against those who\nattacked the students.

So, if you\u2019re\ncraving a wallet-friendly\nculture-fix, why not head\nover to the Tate Modern\nthis weekend for an\nevening of modern art?\nExplore the newly\nopened Blavatnik\nBuilding, listen to the DJ\nas you boogie the night\naway on the terrace bar, or\njust enjoy a coffee as you\nsoak up the Southbank\natmosphere. If you\u2019re not\nup to much, make your\nway to the Turbine Hall to\nlie flat on your back and\nleave an impression of\nyour body on the floor.\nWhile you\u2019re in the Blavatnik Building, head to\nthe Artist Rooms on Level\n4 where American artist\nJenny Holzer is exhibiting\nher work until July 2019.\nDeliberately provocative,\nwords and statements are\ncentral to Holzer\u2019s work,\nwith slogans and clich\u00e9s\nscrawled or printed on\n\u201cDeliberately\nprovocative,\nwords and\nstatements\nare central to\nHolzer\u2019s work\u201d\nall sorts of objects and\nin a variety of media.\nDesigned to be accessible\nto non-artists, the rooms\nare perfect to wander\nthrough and just look at\nwhat catches your attention at that moment. With\neveryday objects that\nappear ordinary until you\ncan get close enough to\nread the text, and her love\nof flickering or electronic\nwords, something different will catch your eye\neach time. Look out for\nher inflammatory essays\nand her \u2018instagrammable\u2019\nBlue Purple Tilt as you\nwander through her\nrooms.\nAnother installation to\nlook out for is Untitled\nby Rudolf Stingel which\ninvites the viewer to\ncreate their own artwork\non wall covered in orange\ncarpet. The work challenges convention, as it is\nonly complete when the\nviewer creates their own\nart with it. It\u2019s constantly\nchanging, with names and\nscribbles easily erased\nwith information and\ndisplays works by a\nnumber of big names in\nthe art world including\nAndy Warhol and pop\nartist Roy Lichenstein.\nKeep an eye out for a\nposter by a group of anonymous American artists\ncalled the Guerilla Girls,\nwho produced fifty advertising posters highlighting\nracial and sexual discrimination in the art world,\nand Pablo Picasso\u2019s Bust\nof a Woman. Painted in\nMay 1944 in Paris during\nthe final months of Nazi\noccupation, this portrait,\nwith its bright colours\nand chaotic background,\ncaptures both the fear and\nhope Picasso felt at this\ncomplex moment in his\nlife.\nIf you love colour, head\ndown to the Start Display\non Level 2 to see some of\nthe gallery\u2019s most popular\nworks.

The\ndistinctive ultramarine\nblue painting is one of 194\nmonochrome paintings\nmade by the artist in his\ntrademark colour International Klein Blue. Klein\nstarted painting these\nmonochromes in 1947,\nconsidering them to allow\nhim to reject the norm of\nrepresentation in painting,\nand so achieve creative\nfreedom.\nFinally, before you take\nthe lift up to Level 10 to\ncatch a stunning view of\nthe London skyline, make\nsure to visit the critically\nacclaimed installation\nThe Clock by Christian\nMarclay. Described as a\n\u2018mesmerising masterpiece\nof contemporary art\u2019,\nthe 24-hour montage\ncompiles video and television footage of clocks\nand timepieces edited\ntogether so that they\nflow in real time.

A lot of insight was\ngained by hearing first\nhand from those fighting\nfor the Democratic Party\nto become a left-wing\nparty, and a true alternative to the Republicans\u2019\ndestructive far-right\nvision for America. Ever\nsince the relative success\nof Bernie\u2019s presidential\ncampaign, these activists\nhave been organising\nunder the banner of\n\u2018Democratic Socialists of\nAmerica\u2019, and have been\ncelebrating major victories including the win of\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nearlier this summer.\nOn the last day, I ended\nup at a brunch event with\nJohn McDonnell (the\nShadow Chancellor) who\nspoke about what steps\na Labour government\nwould take once elected -the first term of the Labour\ngovernment will involve\nreversing the damage\ncaused by the Conservatives\u2019 economic agenda,\nThe free app for students featuring College services,\ntimetable, email preview, campus maps, events calendar\nand much more.\nImperialMobile\nDownload\n\u2192 www.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-mobile\n\u201cThe crowd\nhad a diverse\nmix of young\nand old,\nveterans of the\nmovement and\nthose new to\nit\u201d\nDiverse mix of young and old // Ansh Bhatnagar\nand the second term will\nbe about working towards\nimplementing even more\nnew ideas to radically and\npermanently transform\nour society so that it works\nfor all of us, not just those\nborn with a silver spoon\nin their mouth.

During the\ntalk, I was sat next to a\nlecturer from Goldsmiths\nUniversity as well as a\nyoung activist from the\nmidlands. People from\ndifferent walks of life\nhave all been brought\ntogether by this revital-ised movement, and this\nwas further solidified by\nthe Leaders\u2019 Speech that\nfollowed.\nIn the packed conference hall, Conference\nwas called to an end with\na speech from Jeremy\nCorbyn. The strapline of\nthe Conference was \u201cRebuilding Britain \u2013 For the\nMany, Not the Few\u201d, and\nthis theme was prevalent\nin the speech. It touched\non all the big issues, from\nBrexit to Windrush.
