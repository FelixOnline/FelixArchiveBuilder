The results\nof these elections (?) were that\nJohn Scott was returned as\nCaptain, Chris Bean as Secretary\nand Andv MacAleer as treasurer.\nAmong things discussed were\nthe teams perform anc s this year\nwhich have been, as usual, very\ngood. All the mens leagues were\nwon by IC. The mixed third\ndivision was also won by a very\n'scratch' team. The UL Cup was\nalso won. Thus the season was\nthe most successful of recent\nyears. Thanks for this must go to\nall \"\nthe captains and especially\nPeter Gadd.

Well, that's my worry\nanyway\nREVIEWS!\nMuch noise,\nMuch cheerfulness\nIC Symphony Orchestra\nICSO's summer concerts tend to suffer from\nsmall audiences, due, no doubt, to the\nconflicting claim of revision. Last Wedensday\nwas no exception\u2014a pity as the orchestra gave\nan excellent performance. Since Richard\nDickins has been conducting it, ICSO seems\nto have improved with each concert: my only\nserious criticism this time is at the choice of\nprogramme.\nRimsky Korsakov himself described his\nCapriccio Espagnol as 'undoubtedly a purely\nexternal piece'. It's bright and frothy, using\nSpanish dance themes. The orchestra\nsounded rather hesitant in this first piece. The\ncellos didn't achieve the intended Spanish\nrhythms, but the solo flute was superb and the\nfirst violins came across particularly\nwell\u2014perhaps further 'guest appearances' by\nmusic students and by David Bogle, leader of\nICSO until a couple of years ago, should be\nencouraged!\nThe orchestra appeared more relaxed, and\naccompanied Anna Meadows un self conscious ly, in Mozart's Bassoon Concerto. The\nbassoon makes nice, as well as funny, noises\nbut the instrument does not have sufficient\nvariety of tone to sustain interest through a civilised, but essentially unexciting early\nMozart concerto.\n. ICSO almost invariably plays best in the\nsecond half of the concert\u2014and Glazunov's Symphony no 5 in B flat is an accessible and\nimmediately appealing work. There is much\nnoise, much cheerfulness, a teasing not-quite-jingle-bells theme and a self-indulgent,\nchocolate box of a third movement. The\norchestra produced a rather ragged start to\nthe scherzo, but otherwise gave an excellent\nand most enjoyable performance. I'm only\nPage lOH HM HH HH H HH Hi sorry they didn't apply their talents to\nsomething more deeply rewarding. After being\ntreated to Mahler 1 last term, I had hoped for\ngreater things.\nTo finish on a sartorial note: what a happy\nthought to have all the girls in black and white.\nIt can be most distracting to see deep magenta\nsitting beside pale green and lemon, quite\napart from looking unprofessional.\nMelanie Steel\nStartling Contrasts\nIC Choir\nOn Friday a rather small Imperial College\nChoir plus 'Eric's orchestra' took the stage in\nthe Great Hall for their summer concert. They\nperformed three works: Spring from The Seasons by Haydn, Gounod's Messe\nSolennelle and Poulenc's Gloria.\nThe orchestra started well with the overture\nto Spring, a work for soprano, tenor and bass\nsoloists and chorus. The choir, however, were\ndisappointing. Although their performance of\nthis piece was quite appropriate for Spring\n1983, dull and uninspiring, I don't think it was\nquite what Haydn had intended. Much of their\nsinging was breathy and lacked tone, Perhaps\nthe sound would improve if the choir spent less\ntime with their heads buried in their copies. It\nwasn't until the last chorus of the work that the\nchoir produced their more typical confident\nsound, and the sopranos even managed to hit\na few top notes which had eluded them in most\nof the previous choruses. Both the tenor,\nChristopher Gillett, and the bass-baritone\nRichard Wigmore, sang well although neither\nappeared at all inspired. At times Richard\nWigmore's strange facial expressions while\ncoping with the rather awkward German\nvowels were more interesting than his singing.\nThe soprano, Lyn Parkyns, unfortunately\nsounded very nervous and her tone was harsh.\nGounod's Messe Solennelle was a startling\nMB MH May27,1983 MBH contrast. After a shaky start from the\norchestra the choir came in boldly on some\nvery exposed entries in the Kyrie. The greatly\noutnumbered tenors sang well to help achieve\nsome well-balanced unaccompanied bars at\nthe end of the Kyn'e. Towards the end of the\nGloria the choir lost the good tone and the\nsinging became rather breathy, especially in\nthe soprano and alto lines. For a few bars all\nthat could be heard from the choir was some\nloud hissing as they sang phrases such as\nqu on iam tu sol us sanctus and tu so lu salt is sim us. The Credo which followed was, for me, the\nhigh spot of the concert. Strong brass parts, a dotted rhythm in the lower strings and the\nupper strings playing off the beat accompanied\na marvellous memorable melody sung with\nconviction by the choir. There was, however,\na shaky ending as the men split into four\nparts singing very close chords, the basses\nsuffering when divided. The Credo also saw\none of the rare occasions on which the altos\nproduced a clear confident entry, but\nunfortunately the strings fell in one after the\nother in a rather hazardous manner distracting\nfrom the altos' ache ive ment. Christopher\nGillett gave his best performance of the\nevening in the Sanctus, beautifully accompanied by the harp.\nAfter the interval came Poulenc's Gloria, a work for chorus and soprano solo. Lyn\nParkyns, the soloist, sounded more confident\ntn an in the first half. The choir tackled the\nchallenging syncopated rhythm of the\nLaudamus te very well, and even the sopranos\nmaintained a good tone throughout. Qui sedes\ngave the altos an opportunity to prove that\nconfident entries are not so rare after all. They\nand the tenors came in boldly but, unfortunately, not quite in the same key. This\nproblem was resolved after a few seconds and\nthe choir completed the concert confidently.\nGillian M Richmond\nI FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "A Grim\nWashout?\nDear Martin\nI was somewhat surprised to\nread the news story 'GFimwash\nSnubbed' in last week's FELIX.\nThe implication of the facts is\nclear: that if the Executive consider Andy Grimshaw insufficiently com pet ant to take on the\njob of President for a short time.\nThis suggests the Executive also\nconsider him incapable of\nfulfilling his job as Honorary\nSecretary (a glance at his job\ndescription will verify this).\nWhy, then, have the Executive\nnot seen fit to bring a motion of\nno confidence to the next UGM?\nI would like to suggest two\npossibilities\u2014either Andy is not\nas incompetent as might have\nbeen suggested, or that the\nExecutive have realised that the\nblame for Andy's incompetence\nlies squarely upon their own\nshoulders.\nOthers may disagree, but I would suggest that the prospective demise of two Honorary\nSecretaries in a year (both of\nwhom had little experience but a desire to be helpful and do the\njob well) says more about those\nwith whom they have had to\nwork than about the individuals\nthemselves.\nFurthermore, I can only see\nmatters getting worse next year\nas one of the principal backbiters (Christine 'I never liked\nher from the start' Teller) has\nbeen elected to the Exec!\nI look forward to the controversy at the AGM( June 7,\nME220, 1pm) and remind the\nExec that the deadline for\nmotions of no confidence to\nappear in Exec News as Monday,\nl'/2 weeks before the meeting.\nYours\nNick Pyne\nMore letters on page 4\nThe CND Letters\nDear Martin\nRegarding Robert Kelsey's article in last week's FELIX, I should like to raise the following\npoints:\n1. The Russian attitude to\nunilateral disarmament and\nweakness leaves much to be\ndesired\u2014while the US cut her\narmed forces from 3m to 2m, Russia increased hers to over\n3m; when Britain withdrew from\nthe Indian Ocean, Russia moved\nin; and. remember Afghanistan!\n2. The independent deterrent\nof Britain (and France) is\nnecessary to provide powerful\ndiscouragement to any Russian\nadministration if it were to\ncontemplate the exploitation of\nany future period of American\nfeebleness.\n3. Neutralism rarely deters an\naggressor\u2014remember Belgium\nin the last war.\n4. A reduction in the number\nof nuclear weapons by the West\nwould necessitate an increase in\nthe levels of conventional forces\nrequired to maintain our defensive credibility, the increased\ncosts of which would exceed any\nsavings from the reduction in the\nnuclear arsenal.\n5. Our defence needs do not\npreclude an intensified programme of technical and economic aid to the Third World\u2014\nthirty years ago we spent 1 Wc of\nour national wealth on defence,\nnow we spend about 59c and we\nare much richer.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Pach\nDear Martin\nI'm sorry I'm stealing some\nspace off your otherwise entertaining 'Letters' page, but I feel\nthat since some people use it to\n.argue just for argument's sake, I should be entitled to do so too.\nIn his letter (FELIX 645), Mr\nJ Smith answers 'some of the\nmistaken and misguided state-ment s' Robert Kelsey put\nforward in his disarmament\narticle two weeks ago. Yet, he\ndoes not correct such statements\nwith facts, but just with his own\nideas, which are no more likely\nto be right than Mr Kelsey's. For\nexample. Mr Kelsey probably\ndoes not know about double,\ntreble and en n up le checks\nrequired to launch a missile, but\nhow much more does Mr Smith\nknow? Has he read about them\nin a sci-fi novel? Or in a NATO\npamphlet'1\nCan he tell the\ndifference between the two?\nAs for the next argument, it is\nmy personal opinion that, even\nby arming itself, Britain will still\nbe a 'weakling' with respect to\nthe two 'big guys'. In any case,\nusing a bit of logic, it is not hard\nto see why arming to achieve\ndisarmament is contradictory: if\nboth sides think that acquiring\nnew weapons will cause the\nopponent to d isar rp, then they\nboth will do so. causing armament rather than disarmament.\nAnd so on. I do not intend to\ngo on arguing on this page, as\nmy letter would become longer\nand more boring than Mr\nSmith's. If he wants to hear my\npersonal views on the rest of his\nletter, he may drop in for a cup\nof coffee.\nYours sincerely\nOlivo Miotto\nDear Martin\nResponse to Robert Kelsey's article on unilateral disarm a ment, as expressed in your letters\npage last week, has left me\ngreatly dismayed. I would be\ngrateful for the space in your\ncolumns with which to reply to\nsome of the criticism.\nI was particularly disappointed with Mr Jonathan\nSmith's singularly cynical attack\non Rob's arguments and would\nlike to offer him some thoughts\nof my own. In his letter he\nprovides enlightenment on the\nlogic Of the 'position of strength'\nargument (ie that we should arm\nto disarm) by reducing the\ninternational nuclear arms race\nto a school-yard scenario. Such a euphemistic analogy not only\nan aes thetis es the issues at stake\nbut is also manifestly incorrect.\nHe argues that it is more\nadvantageous to play the bully\nin the nuclear weapons game\nbecause one is then in a position\nto force concessions from one's 'weakling' opponent. However,\nwhat he fails to realise is that, in\nmilitaristic terms. Russia is by no\nmeans a weakling and when\nthreatened by improved American weaponry the Kremlin's only obvious course is to\nmodernise her own forces. This\nis precisely what has happened\nin the past forty years\u2014surely by\nnow it is abundantly clear that\nany attempt to negotiate from a position of strength is inherently\nself-defeating.\nMr Smith then goes on to\nstate, in defence of the 'concept\nof deterrence', that whilst it is\nOK for the NATO and Warsaw\nPact countries, with their greater\n'political stability', to threaten\neach other with mass murder as\na means of maintaining peace\n(and harmony?), there are\ncertain 'tin-pot dictatorships and\nrevolutionary juntas' who would\nnot be 'suitable custodians of\nsuch immense power'. Having\nneatly divided the nations of the\nworld into these three distinct\ncategories we are left to admire\nour political maturity. Once\nagain his viewpoint is lacking in\nboth depth and humanity.\nI would just like to comment\nthat according to a United\nNations report of last year the\nmassive expenditure on nuclear\narms is placing an intolerable\nstrain on the global economy\nand rapidly paving the way for\nworld instability which, in the\nop in on of the UN, is a one-way\nticket to war.\nYours sincerely\nStephen Curry\nPhysics 1\nDere mister Editor\nEvery weak, me and my fr end read your newspaper and my\nfr end sa that he thinks he nos\nwot to do a bow t new clear we pons. He sa that if the best way to\nstop war and bien g blown up is\nto have lots of bom s, then we\nneed more. Also, if everyone had\nthere own bom, it would be\ngood, cos there wu d be no mor\nwars.

At a UNESCO conference on poverty and aid in Bombay, a rightwing Indian novelist called Victor Mehta\n(played superbly by Roshan Seth\u2014Nehru in\nAttenborough's Gandhi) is invited to deliver a keynote address. At the conference he meets\na young left wing journalist (Bill Nighy) and\nbetween them passionate opposition is\ndeclared. The presence of an American\nactress (Diana Quick) triggers, in an amusing\nway, an ideological showdown which is battled\nout during the assembly and at times of\nadjournment. Clever scene changes show also\nthat a film is being made of the original events\nin Bombay, based on the Indian novelist's autobiography.\nHare wrote A Map of the World 'partly out\nof exasperation at the English resistance to\nseeing anything except in an English context.\nThe minute you leave this country you become\naware of how local the English fashion for right\nwing ideas is. If you travel in the Third World,\nthe belief that the liberal experiment is over\nseems parochial'. However, the play is by nc\nmeans a one-sided exposition of left-wing\nideas. On the contrary, the play sparkles as\nboth socialist and right-wing philosophy are\nbrought face to face in a series of arguments in\nthe grand manner of 'epic theatre'. Provocative and illuminating arguments are nearly\nalways counterbalanced by others in the style\nof Bernard Shaw and the great political and\npolemical dramas which have at their core a major (and entertaining) debate between left\nand right.\nThe n lav takes its title from Oscar Wilde's saying that 'a map of the world which does not\ninclude Utopia is not worth even glancing at'.\nThe theme of Utopia is central to the play's left-right debate (as it nearly always is in this\ndebate). The character Mehta believes that\nhope is irrational and that he is merely facing\nthe facts. Believing otherwise is a vanity. 'The\ngreatest enemy of Man is self-deception' he\nsays. On the other hand, his opponent attacks\nhis hopelessness and people like him who\nseem to be in love with misery and death, and\nwho grow angry when hopes are suggested to\nthem.\nFELIXH\nBut the title of the play also refers to one of\nthe Indian novelist's lines and it is this which\nforms the real thrust of the drama. He\ncomplains that we only notice those things\nwhich fit in with what we already believe, and\n'for everything that suits us we place upon our\nmap'.\nThe play throws up an extraordinary\nnumber of issues and arguments. Mehta's arrival at the conference causes anger among\nsome delegates, particularly the Africans. He is\nasked to read out a statement, drafted by a committee, on the nature of fiction (he is asked\nto denounce it!). He refuses, citing the writer's absolute freedom to say what he wants. He\nposition is countered by an African politician,\nM 'Bengue (played by South African born John\nMatshikiza) who objects, in an electric speech,\nthat such freedom is frequently abused and\nparticularly by the Western press in their\nreporting of anything that has to do with the\nThird World. He describes the exasperation\nand hurt of having the life of one's country only\never being reported in terms of elephants ('you\nprefer elephants to people'), natural disaster\nand in the political terms of the struggle\nbetween the two great power blocs. (This\nbitter attack on the Western press is one of the\nfew arguments in the play that are allowed to\ngo unanswered.) One of the interesting quotes\nin the programme booklet is by WH Auden\nwho says that 'all advances in knowledge from\nGalileo down to Freud or Marx are, in the first\nimpact, humi latin g. They begin by showing us\nthat we are not as free or as grand or as good\nas we thought.' Most of us realise that\nalthough rr ~re is no such thing as absolute\nfreedom ('one man's freedom necessarily\ncurtails another') we can at least fall back on\nfreedom of expression. But Mr Hare is\nshowing us that even this is limited.\nThroughout the first half of the play foreign\naid is presented as an apparently good thing.\nBut it is later revealed that (and, granted, these\nideas are not terribly new) the World Bank and\nthe IMF seek to dictate the social policies of\nthose countries to whom they give help and\nthat by accepting aid, Third World countries\nbecome either political colonies of the aid\ngiver s, or they have to abandon social policies\nof which the monetarist s of the IMF\ndisapprove. This rather unacceptable situation\nprovides an ironic twist to the line on 'freedom'\nthat the play pursues.\nA Map of the World is a very rich and\nintelligent play. It was surprising to notice; that\nthe arguments were so inventive and appealing\n(on both sides) that there was very near\naudience participation. To say the atmosphere\nwas 'electric' sounds pretentious but in this\ncase it virtually was. During some of the\nspeeches one could hear several members of\nthe audience murmur approvals ('yea gh' in the\ncase of American members over some of the\nthe more right wing ideas) as well as\ndisapproval s. The production at the NT is highly\nrecommended and I'm convinced it's destined\nto become a modern classic despite the fact\nthat it was very unfairly torn to pieces by 'the\ncritics' at its opening. The critics have totally\nmisunderstood the play, probably because\nthey directed all their attention in finding things\nto criticise. If the critics would concentrate on\ndescribing the play and leave the public to do\nthe judging then the contemptible level of\ntheatre (and art) in this country would be\nmuch improved. ^ Bedding I May27,1983 Page 9\n\n"

We believe that\nthis is one of the main risks facing us today\nand that indeed the 'balloon might go up'\nany time.\nDespite his accusation that we are guilty\nof misrepresentation he begins his article by\nmisquoting our book. We do not state in the\nbook that 'we must learn to live with their\n(the nuclear weapons') eventual use', but\nthat 'we must learn to live with the threat of\ntheir eventual use'. A subtle difference,\neither deliberately ignored or lost on J Martin Taylor.\nWe did not expect to find that civil\ndefence was a 'reasonable proposition'; we\nstarted with open minds. However, William\nWhitelaw does still believe in Civil Defence\nand has brought before Parliament new\nregulations to force local authorities to\ncooperate with government plans. It is this\ndebate that the book engages in and in\nwhich it has been powerfully endorsed by\nthe recent British Medical Association\nreport.\nIn his conclusion Mr Taylor states that he\nremains unconvinced that the peace-loving\nSoviet government 'is just waiting for a conciliatory gesture from the West'. We\nnever suggested that the USSR were any\nmore peace loving than the USA. If you wish\nto point the finger of blame, however, the\nLondon\nAfter the Bomb\nThe authors' reply to Martin Taylor's interview.\ntruth is that the Americans\u2014for whatever\nreasons\u2014have led the arms race since 1945\nand have remained five to ten years ahead in\nmissile technology They were first with the\nA bomb, the H bomb, submarine-launched\nmis isles, multiple warheads and now the\ncruise missile.\nTo suggest that the Soviet Union\nincreased their levels of conventional and\nnuclear forces in response to Jimmy Carter's pledge to reduce military spending is\nludicrous. At this time the Americans were\nway ahead in missile warhead numbers. The\nSoviet spending was to catch up. The\ninvasion of Afghanistan is a separate\nissue\u2014is Mr Taylor suggesting that it would\nnot have happened if America had had\nmore nuclear weapons? They would not\nmore have prevented this invasion than\nPolaris prevented Argentina invading the\nFalklands.\nFinally, we must counter his simplistic\narguments about nuclear weapons 'not\nmaking us a target' and the 'strong attacking\nthe weak'. Firstly, once nuclear war has\nbroken out nuclear weapons bases are\nobviously targets. The more Britain has, the\nmore heavily it will be targeted.\nMr Taylor argues that history has shown\nthat strong nations attack weak nations, and\nthat therefore it would be dangerous for\nBritain to reduce its numbers of weapons.\nThere comes a point, however, when being\n'strong' becomes being 'threatening'. We\nargue that the new nuclear weapons\ndevelopments have increased the level of\nthreat to such an unacceptable degree that\nwe are all more at risk.\nFinally, it seems that Mr Taylor cannot\nhave much faith in the strength of his\narguments\u2014rather than raise them during\nthe interview, he preferred presenting them\nin a 'sour grapes' fashion at the end of the\narticle. v Yours\n(Dr) PR Webber and N Turok\nA few points:\n1) The article was in three parts: review,\ninterview, and personal conclusions. I did not\nraise all the points in the review and\nconclusions at the interview because it was\nan interview and not a debate.\n2) Ido not believe that I have misquoted the\nbook. If it had read as they state I would not\nhave mentioned the sentence at all.\n3) I did not say that they exaggerate the risks\nof nuclear war; I said that they exaggerate the\nrisks of accidental nuclear war.\n4) I am still dismayed that they see the USA\nand the USSR as equally aggressive, but Idid\nnot accuse them of seeing the USSR as more\npeace-loving.\n5) Idid not suggest that the invasion of\nAfghanistan would have been stopped by\nmore US missiles, but I do think it shows an\naggressive attitude by the USSR.\n6) I have every faith in the strength of my\narguments, and in no way intended a 'sour\ngrapes' attitude. I am sorry they have taken\nan offended tone, the impression that I was\ntrying to convey was that I was quite\nimpressed by the book but that I disagreed\nwith the conclusions they draw from it which\nthey expressed in the interview.\nJ Martin Taylor\nOoaosite Natural History Museum, 2 nuns from South Kensington Tube)\nCOCKTAIL AND WINE BAR\nOpen\nMonday-Friday: 6:00-11:00\nSaturday: 8:00-11:00\nINTRODUCING\nHAPPY HOURS\n6:00-9:00pm Cocktails at \u00a31.50 & Drinks 80p Closed Bank Holiday Monday\n(May 30)\nKensington Committee of Friendship for\nOverseas Students GRAND RAFFLE\nAND DANCE\nSaturday 4 June in the JCR\nAs the second prize for the Grand Raffle is\na Sinclair ZX 'Spectrum' microcomputer\nwith colour graphics and sound, you may\nbe interested to know that Miss Fran\nFarzan will be coming along to demonstrate the Sinclair machine from 8:30-10:00pm.

Teams of four\ncompetitors drive around some\nsurprisingly obscure parts of\nLondon solving clues (what is\nthe title of the book Albert is\nreading on the Albert Memorial?)\nand collecting treasure (where\nare you supposed to find an\nempty toothpaste tube?).\nTraditionally, the rally is set\nby the Editor, the Puzzles Editor\nand a third party who has a car\nin London. Pinocchio and I have\nalready started thinking up\nvarious devious places to send\nyou, but we are rather hampered\nby the absence of a motor\nvehicle. So if anyone with a car\nwould like to help set the rally\nwith us, I'd be very grateful if\nthey'd get in touch as soon as\npossible at the FELIX Office.\nImpossible Without\nAdrian James for news, Peter\nHobbis for photography, Gastropod and Pinocchio for their\nrespective columns, Melanie\nSteel, Gill Richmond and Nick\nBedding for reviews, Diane Love\nfor Nosferatu and What's On,\nChris Mallaband for sport, Paul\nPhillipou for delivery every\nweek, Peter Rodgers, La Iatrou,\nKarl Schmidt, Lynne James,\nAndy Wood, Martin Taylor and\nHugh Southey for pasting up,\nand Maz and Pete the Print.\nTIME, I SUPPOSE, to devote a few paragraphs in this column to\nthe great and glorious Stephen\nGoulder. Fair-minded, hard-working, keen to stay in touch\nwith the students he represents\u2014what a superb President\nhe would make if only he\npossessed these qualities. Not\nthat he is totally without merit,\nof course; as I have said before,\nhis way with words and his sense\nof humour are second to none in\nthe Union Office at the moment.\nUnfortunately, many of the\nUnion staff feel that Mr Goulder\nuses his humour to cover up his\nfailings by laughing off criticism.\nThey say his jovial pomposity\nhas become not a valid and\nuseful tool for brushing aside the\nirritating trivia which inevitably\ncom kes his way, but as insensitivity which permits him to\ndismiss all fault-finding as\npiff ling discontent from ungrateful minions. Rather like Victor\nMooney or Ronald Reagan he\nsets himself up as a figure of\njollity and mirth and uses this as\na shield from his critics. Consequently he rarely takes advice\nfrom anybody and runs the\nUnion by doing exactly what he\npleases whether e he is supposed\nto have authority or not.\nThis came to a head this week\nwhen he 'found' a Gestetner\nduplicating machine in the\nUnion Office. Lesser or more\nhumble men might have asked\nabout its origin, or its intended\ndestination. And they would\nsurely have asked Andy Grimshaw about it, since about the\nonly clearly defined part of the\nHonorary Secretary's job is\nBELOW looking after the Union's duplicators.\nStephen, however, full of his\nown importance and in magnanimous mood, phoned up\nGuilds Union and offered it to\nthem for nothing. Guilds, not\nbeing slow to take advantage of\nsuch an opportunity, had the\nduplicator back to their office in\nMech Eng within the hour.\nEnter Mr Andrew Grimshaw,\npuzzled by the disappearance of\nthe new Gestetner he had\nrecently acquired to replace the\ndilapidated machine he has been\nmaking do with all year. A few\nsuitable enquiries, and an\nembarrassed Union President\nwas heard making a grovelling\nphone call to the officers of\nC&G. The story might have ended\nthere given f ven a little tact and\ncommon sense on the part of our\nle auer. As it was, though, he\npaid a visit to the Guilds Office\nand, finding a Gestetner lying\nidly by, took it back to Andy\nGrimshaw in the Union without\nmaking any enquires in Guilds\nat all. Surprise, surprise, he soon\ndiscovered he had brought back\nthe wrong machine, and had to\nspend another few hours tracking\ndown the Guilds duplicating\nofficer to sort things out.\nICU Publications Board, and\nFELIX in particular has also\nhad to suffer the force of\npresidential pomp.

This produced on his\nlisteners a soporific response of\nglum acceptance, rather like a form of prep-school boys hearing their house master explain\nwhy their pocket money is being\nreduced. By the end of his\nrhetoric Stephen's explanation\nhad slowly but distinctly acquired the unmistakable aura of\na very formal and serious\nspeech, and it became obvious\nthat he was leading up to his big\nconclusion.\nT am sorry we are so short of\nmoney' he said, loudly T am\nsorry these cutbacks are necessary but, as I am sure you're all\naware,' and here he dropped his\nvoice to a slow, deep, melodramatic whisper, 'it is unavoidable under the economic constraints forced upon us all\ntoday'.\nThere was a full five seconds\nimpressive silence, when suddenly the listeners realised what\na mountain of p retention had\nbeen conveying such a molehill\nof an idea, and the presidential\ndignity was punctured by a sudden outburst of prolonged\nhysterical laughter.\nAnd so to an aggrieved letter\nfrom M Johnson, Met 3 and T Stockings, Mat Tech 2, who tell\nme that once upon a time they\nwere the winners of a raffle\norganised by ICU, the prize\nbeing a trip round Wadsworths\nbrewery. Mr Goulder told them\nthey would be notified of the\ndate of the visit in due course.\nNo notification was forthcoming\nso they investigated, only to\ndiscover the trip had already\ntaken place and they had missed\nit.\n'Is it not a sad reflection on\nthe President,' they ask 'that he\ncan't even organise a piss-up in a brewery?'\nLAST WEEK I wrote of Andy\nGrimshaw advertising for a woman to accompany him to a coral atoll in the Indian Ocean.\nBut since then it has been\npointed out that the advertisement was not for 'a woman' but\nfor 'another female member' to\njoin the expedition. Now just\nsupposing they had been a man\nshort: one can only wonder\nwhether Andy would have put a quarter page ad in FELIX asking for another male member.\nAnd talking of the expedition,\nUnion Administrator Jen HardySmith has been asking what\neight gramophone records Andy\nwill be taking to his island. Any\nsuggestions? I am offering a small but prestigious prize for\nthe best appropriate record for\nan Hon Sec such as Andy to take\nto his desert island.\nFELIX May27,1983 Page 5\n\n"

No\ndoubt the whole sordid subject will eventually\nsurface in the letters page or 'Under the Strap'\nof the College newspaper, FEELSICK, but let\nme tell you of the upshot: the Union Office\nnow has five Gestetners. Originally, Artful\nWhitewash, Honourable Gestetner-Purchaser\nhad arranged them in the office as shown in\nthe first diagram; the Union Office is twenty\nfeet square, and as you can see, the furthest\nanyone has to walk in order to get to a Gestetner is ten feet. However, ace mathematician Junk MuckStallion has pointed out\nthat the Gestetners can be placed so that the\nfurthest anyone has to walk is considerably\nreduced. Steel Goolies, never keen on walking\ntoo far, and always being fond of moving\nGestetners, has agreed to have them moved,\nbut to what new positions should they be\nmoved?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please.

There are\ntwo reasons for this: one is that I am a mathematician, the other of which is that a good puzzle, like most of maths, has to have a certain aesthetically pleasing quality, as well as\nbeing hard. This 'beauty' is rarely found in\nengineering problems, which either involve\nknowing a special formula (eg for torque,\ncentre of gravity etc) or just involve scrabbling\naround in messy equations. When I was being\ntaught algebra (perhaps the most beautiful\nsubject in maths) by Dr Pretzel, it was quite\nclear the delight that he found in a 'slick' proof,\nand his disapproval of 'vulgar' proofs, which\ninvolved getting back to basics and messing\naround generally. Even non-mathematicians\nhave pointed out to me how much they like the\nvery simple proof that there are infinitely many\nprimes. I'm sorry, but I can't explain myself\nany better; good mathematical puzzles have\nan indefinable quality that is rarely found in\nscience or engineering. I'd be interested to\nhear your views, though!\nIncidentally, Gordias (who wrote last week's puzzle) is a physicist!\nSorry, I nearly forgot \u2014 last week's winner was Richard Glover (again!) who must\nknow by now where to get the cheque from.\nWALKABOUTlOOKStt\nby Mtbile Optics Inc.\nNo puzzle this week, just a few comments.\nSomebody did write to me right at the\nbeginning of this term saying he was interested\nFirst, let me rectify an omission from this\ncolumn last week: the New Art Centre is at 41\nSloane Street.

    "content": "Mocks Miller\nDear Martin\nI was surprised by Mr Martin's letter about the SCC Mock\nGeneral Election. He questions\nthe democracy of the ballot as\ncandidates had to be sponsored\nby one of the five (not three Mr\nMartin) political societies. I understand democracy as being\naccepting the will of the major-it y. Mr Martin knows, since I am\nglad to say he was present at the\nmeeting, that a majority of the\nClubs present voted for this\ncriteria to be applied to can di dates. As I made quite clear at\nthe meeting I think this was a wrong decision but I a cee pt the\nwill of the majority\u2014that is\nwhat real democracy is all about.\nMr Martin asks people to\nabstain on Thursday June 2 but\nI hope people will vote. There\nwill be ballot boxes in Mech\nEng, Mines, Sherfield, Huxley,\nthe JCR and Union Building\nfrom 12:30pm to 2:30pm. You\nwill need Unioncards to vote.\nThe candidates at each of these\nsix constituencies will be Labour, Conservative and Alliance. There will be two concurrent ballots: one based on\nSTV and the other on a 'first\npast the post' system I hope\npeople share my view that this\nkind of election will be an\n\u2022amusing distraction in a boring\nexam term. It will not change the\nresults on June 9, it will not\nprove any ting, the results may\nnot be a great surprise. I merely\nhope that it will be fun. Don't abstain, VOTE on June 2.\nYours democratically\nJonathan M Miller\nChem 3\nSCC Chairman\nMocking Miller\nDear Martin\nI would like to make one or\ntwo points on the subject of\nJonathan Miller's mock 'ele c tion' to be held on June 2.\nHaving announced his decision\nto hold such an event at the last\nUGM, he was then able to push\nthe idea through the full Social\nClubs Committee meeting (held\nafter the UGM) on the basis that\nit had already been agreed and\ndespite the opposition of all the\npolitical societies. The compromise to allow only candidates\nnominated by political societies\nwas agreed because it was\ngenerally recognised that the\nidea would be unworkable\notherwise. (If this had only had\nthe support of the political\nsocieties as Neil Martin alleges in\nhis letter last week then it would\nnot have been passed since they\nare a minority on SCC.)\nHowever, for a number of\nreasons which I will deal with\nlater the political societies\nremained unenthusiastic. So\nmuch so that only ConSoc was\nin fact prepared to nominate\ncandidates, and then only\nreluctantly. In the absence of a proper field of candidates Mr\nMiller, being anxious not to lose\nface (especially in the light of his\nrecently increased status as\nacting-President) decided that\ninstead he would hold a ballot\nwith only the names of the two\nmain parties and the Alliance on\nthe ballot papers. The results of\nthis exercise in unscientific\nopinion polling will of course be\ncompletely meaningless. Despite\nthis Mr Miller is still proposing\nto spend \u00a3200 of Union money\non the 'election'. It's just as well\nhe's only going to be President\nfor five days if this is the kind of\nhare-brained scheme he comes\nup with.\nIn case anyone is thinking that\nthe blame for making this mock\n'election' into a farce rests with\nthe political clubs, consider these\npoints. First, relatively few\npeople are going to even be in\nCollege to vote at the time of the\nelection and those that are will\nmainly be doing exams; and if\nactive members of political clubs\ndo have any spare time during\nexams they will no doubt be\ninvolved in canvassing for their\nrespective parties in the real\nelection in marginal constituencies (ie not around College).\nMore seriously, any publicity\nproduced or distributed locally\nduring the general election\ncampaign, even for a mock\nelection, would almost certainly\nbreak the electoral law unless\nauthorised by the local can di dates' agent (which it seems\nunlikely it would be). The\nturnout for such a mock 'ele c tion' would be extremely low for\nthese reasons, and so would have\nno chance of producing a reliably representative result.\nDespite these facts, which I presented at the U GM, Mr\nMiller (ably assisted by John\nPassmore) managed to secure\nacceptance of his proposals, not\nby refuting my arguments (I think his argument was 'it'll be a bit of fun') but by making it\nappear that I was merely afraid\nthat the party which I support\nwould not win. I think subsequent events have shown that\nMr Miller's idea of a mock\nelection, although well meaning,\nis ill-conceived and at totally the\nwrong time. I hope that he does\nthe sensible thing and calls the\nwhole thing off before he wastes\nany more time and money (or is\nmade to look even sillier than he\nalready does).\nYours etc\nJ Martin Taylor\nHate Campaign\nDoes IC hate residents at Evelyn\nGardens?\nDuring the past two years I have slowly come to believe IC\nhates Evelyn Gardens. I have\nheard rumours that Mining\nHouse has the worst record of all\nstudent residences for the quality\nof degrees obtained. Now at last\nI have realised this is not due to\nthe excellent social life at Mining\nHouse, but a planned campaign\nby IC.\nBefore the exams last year it\nwas repairs to frost damage at\nthe front of the street. This year I have moved to the rear of the\nhouse and the work has moved\nwith me in the form of scaffolding and fiddling with drains.\nBoth of these operations are very\nnoisy and as a result detrimental\nto serious study.\nThe clever part of the IC\nstrategy is the way they have\nmanaged to find repairs and\nplan it to coincide with the\nweeks preceding the exam\nperiod, instead of using the\nmany months throughout the\nsummer when exams are not on\nthe minds of IC students! It will\nbe interesting to see how long IC\ncan keep up the pressure on\nEvelyn Gardens by finding new\nrepairs to carry out before the\nexams each year.\nYours (suffering from a headache and not paranoia)\nMr S Williams\nAero 2\nMember of Mining House\nFELIX:\nBest in the Country\nSir\nYour front page on the UGM\nof May 12 was an interesting and\nsurprising example of selective\nreporting.\nYour correspondent, strange-ly, seems to have completely\nmissed the point of my opposition to the procedural motion\nwhich had been backed by the\nthreat of a call for quorum from\nits proposer s if we dared to\noppose it. What I said, quite\nclearly, was that those of us who\ncondemn these attempts to\nsteamroller through left-wing\nmotions had absolutely no wish\nto see the normal business of the\nUnion disrupted. We were there\nto stand up against the subversive motion, and not to stop the\nmeeting getting on with its\nimportant work.\nIt was quite clear from the\nresponse to my comments that\nthe procedural motion was\nabout to be heavily defeated if it\nwas allowed to go to a vote; so\nthat the Union would be able to\nproceed with the election of\nofficers. There is not doubt in\nmy mind that quorum was called\nin order to prevent the U GM from throwing out that sinister\nmotion with its crude blackmail\nthreat.\nAt the same time, those who\nput up these highly politically\nmotivated motions at UGMs\nshould realise that the executive\nof RSMU was elected to represent the interests of all members\nof RSMU and has every intention of continuing to do so. As\nyou quite rightly said in your\neditorial, the concept of quo racy is one of the Union's fundamental protections against being\nrailroaded by a fanatical minor-it y. It would be quite wrong for\nICU to be bound by extreme\npolitical motions quietly passed\nby an unrepresentative handful\nof ambitious socialists to the\ngreat detriment of the interests\nof the majority.\nFELIX is easily the best\nnewspaper of its kind in the\ncountry. We all hope that you\nwill continue to maintain the\nstandards of impartial journalism that are the foundations of\nits success.\nTim Williams\nVice-President\nRSMU\nGod or Mammon?\nDear Editor\nI have had some enquiries\nabout an organisation calling\nitself 'The School of Economic\nScience' which has its headquarters in Queensgate. It is\nquite secretive about its act iv i ties, but appears to have some\naspects of a religious cult. If\nanyone has been approached by\nrepresentatives of this organ is a tion, or can give me any information about it, I would be glad if\nyou could give me a ring on\nInternal 4221, or send a note to\nthe Chaplains Office, 10 Princes\nGardens.\nThanks\nDavid Ashforth\nChaplain\nPage 4 May27,1983 FELIX\n\n"

However, it wa,s driven b v Simon Moore, ICU Transport Officer and RCSU\nhack to the Guilds U GM which\nwas taking place by the Albert\nMemorial in Hyde Park. There,\nthe RCS mascot ry team noticed\nthat the Guilds van was accompanied by a Mini which they\nsuspected was used for transporting the Guilds mascots.\nThey started to disable it by\nremoving some parts from the\nengine but were seen by a Hyde\nPark policeman who, thinking\nthat they were car thieves, called\nhis Hyde Park headquarters. As\nthe team followed the Guilds\nvan out of the Queen's Gate, the\ndiplomatic police outside the\nIraqui Embassy attempted to\nstop it, but were not seen by Mr Moore, who continued to follow\nthe Guilds van. The latter took aU turn back to the Park, in an\nattempt to lose its followers. By\nthen, all the police in the area\nhad been warned and, had the\nR CSU van not been stopped'\nby a police car inside the park,\ncontinued on page 3\nC& GU Nuts lift Spanner and Bolt at last Thursday's handover UGM\nEven Stephen!\nAfter a fierce argument with\nHonorary Secretary Andy Grimshaw last Monday, Stephen\nGoulder was seen in the Union\nBar drinking heavily, waving a stool and shouting 'Kill Grimwash' at regular intervals.\nHe then started an argument\nNo. 646ms^ mmm mm with Sean Davis, next year's Hon Sec. This developed into\nwhat he later described as a 'friendly tussle' and Nick Pyne,\nthe U GM Chairman and ex-Welfare Officer, intervened\u2014\nonly to be banned from the\nUnion Bar by an intemperate\nand irate President.\nMr Goulder later apologised\nto all concerned.\n^mmm^m Friday, May27,1983 LOUTS OUT\nSix students from Tizard Hall\nhave been fined \u00a325 each after\nransacking the Assistant Subwarden's room late on Tuesday.\nIn addition three have been told to\nleave the Hall immediately after\ntheir exams.\nThe students have until today\nto accept the fines or face the\nCollege Disciplinary Committee\nwhich has not met for over three\nyears.\nThe three students told to\nleave, Nick Barnes, Dave Hopper and Richard Simpson, are\nunhappy with the decision\nbecause they will not be refunded\nrent they have already paid (\u00a350\nfor two of them) and also\nbecause they feel they have been\nsingled out. However the Hall\nWarden told them to leave\nbecause he fears they will disturb\nother residents who are still\nrevising for their exams.\nThe other named students are\nMat Moran, Duncan Wright and\nPeter Webb but they claim at\nleast fifteen students were\ninvolved.\nThe incident occurred on the\nnight of the Tizard Hall coming\ndown dinner and was a result of\nbad feeling which built up\nbetween the students (five of\nwhom are re-aps) and Steve\nJohnson, the Assistant SubWarden, during the year. The ransacking left the room uninhabitable for the night after the bed\nhad been soaked and covered in\nshaving foam. The students\nclaim they entered through the\nwindow although it has been\nsuggested they must have used a pass-key. They have been\ninterviewed by Geoffrey Reeves,\nCollege Security Officer, about\nthis.\nThey're at it again! This front page from last year's FELIX shows that\nno news is new news!\nI Free!\n\n"

    "content": "ye\nTraffyck Warden From the mind that brought you Horns of Uncertainty and Cordon Bleugh,\nDiane Love has turned her hand to the classic horror story with this\nCaledonian tale of mystery and suspense. Read on if you dare\nIt was on a chill December morning that I first\nsaw the Creature. Business took me to Old\nCollege, the most ancient and central part of\nEdinburgh University. Fortunately, I was on\nfoot.\nThe last veils of dawn were rising from the\ncity and a thin mist clung to the ground. My\nfeet crunched loudly\u2014a little too loudly\u2014on\nthe gravel underfoot as I crossed the car park.\nSomewhere in the gloom I could see a dark\nfigure flitting, almost bat-like from car to car. I rubbed my eyes. The apparition was still there.\nUngainly and awkward, he wore a black\npeaked cap, a black cloak and black garments\nbeneath. His head appeared hairless, his ears,\nlarge and intricately convoluted. His teeth,\npointed and v ul pine, glinted as he flashed an\neery, manic grin and po unc d \u2014yes, pounced\non a car. From the unimaginable depths of his\nattire he withdrew a notebook and pencil. A horrifying serpentine tongue flicked over' the\nend of the pencil and disappeared in a fraction\nof a second. He scribbled frantically, and\nacross the car park, 1 could hear a dread fu i, burbling chuckling which seemed inhuman.\nWith a triumphant flourish, he slammed\nsomething on the car windscreen and, hissing,\nsidled off. Then he paused, raised his head\nmomentarily and seemed to look straight at\nme. I felt hairs tickling on the nape of my necK\nand icy chills ran down my spine. 1 hurried into\nthe safety of the building. When 1 came out\nlater, it was full daylight and he was nowhere to\nbe seen.\nTime passed and I thought little of the\nincident. I was in the process of acquiring my\nvery first car\u2014no more than a dilapidated\nFord Escort, but a car nevertheless. I mentioned this in conversation with my\nDirector of Studies, Professor Van Hiring. A shadow seemed to cross his face as he\nmuttered a sinister name I shall never forget:\n'Nosferatu'\nI blanched and remembered the Creature in\nthe car park, even before 1 was told of the\nconnection.\n'You will become vulnerable to a creature\nmore ancient than the university itself, as old\nas the land on which it was built, perhaps.\nNever seen in sunlight, and with his skin\nprotected from the light even on dull days, the\nCreature haunts the university grounds. There\nis but one talisman that can protect you\u2014a university parking permit. Display it plainly in\nyour windscreen, for he cannot bear the sight\nof that hallowed disc'.\nHe shook his head gravely, seeming to\nremember some horror in the past that was\ntoo abominable even to mention. I left without\nasking more.\nIt was with some trepidation that I drove into\nuniversity for the first time. My parking disc\nwas prominent in the windscreen, but I half-wished I had one to wear myself. There was no\nsign of Nosferatu that day. Perhaps the permit\nwas powerful enough to keep him from the car\npark altogether.\nOne morning in late January I was in a hurry, late for my first lecture. It was cold and\nthe car windows had misted up. The permit\nhad fallen from the windscreen because of the\nmoisture, but it was still visible from the\noutside, and I. didn't replace it.\nThat evening at twilight, as I was walking\nback to the car park, there was an ungainly\nfigure in black hopping and leaping purposefully towards my car. I ran up and unlocked the\ndoor.\n'Nosferatu, I have a parking permit'. The\nCreature hissed in horror and leaped\nbackward\" a full six feet. Then, warily skirting\nthe car, he came towards me. I stood, too\nterrified to move a muscle. For the first time I looked into those ancient and terrible eyes and\nsaw no life there, just horror. The lips drew\nback revealing an appalling array of uneven\nyellow teeth with canines an inch long. A gnarled, bony hand reached out for me, the\nnails, disgustingly long claws, came near to my\nflesh and I fainted.\nI awoke to find myself sitting in my car with\nthe door still open. My head reeled and I could\nhear sounds of a beating like bats' wings. I rubbed my stiff neck and was horrified to see\nblood on my fingers. Questions whirled in my\nmind as I drove home, by instinct. I was weak\nand in shock, and I went straight to bed.\nThe next morning I woke up with migraine,\nalthough sunlight was streaming in through my\nwindow. I ran to shut the curtains and then,\nquickly feeling better, I washed and dressed.\nThere were two puncture marks on my neck\nbut they seemed to be healing without\ninfection. Putting on my darkest sunglasses\nand a wide-brimmed hat, I left for university.\nBut as I approached the car I could sense an\nevil presence within it. I walked warily around.\nThe sensation was strongest at the front\nnear side corner. Looking in through the\nwindscreen, I saw the parking permit and my\nstomach gave a sickening lurch. Without\nstopping to think, I opened the door, gingerly\npicked up the permit by a corner and threw it\ninto a drain, crying out as it seared my\nfingertips.\nI never saw Nosferatu again. The mysterious\npunctures healed without trace, and after I passed my finals I came down to Imperial\nCollege to do research.\nAnd yet, even now, I feel the urge to wear\nblack clothing. I never venture outside without\nmy wide-brimmed hat and my sunglasses and I have developed a morbid craving to stare at\nparked cars. At first I wasn't sure what Iwas\nlooking for, but I have come to realise that\nillegal parking makes me physically ill.\nI have suffered silently for many months\nnow, my own frail human will struggling against\na power older and stronger than time itself, but\nin vain. Last week I took charge of a stack of\ngummed notices and tonight I shall make W first venture into the car park.\nI have only till sunset to wait.\nFELIX May27,1983 Page13\n\n"
