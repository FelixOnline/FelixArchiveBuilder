The American Film\nInstitute has defined the\nWestern as films \u201cset in\nthe American West that\nembody the spirit, the\nstruggle and the demise\nof the new frontier\u201d \u2013 a\nclassification that fails to\ntake into account the work\nof Japanese directors like\nKurosawa, or subgenres\nlike the post-apocalyptic\nwestern.\nHowever, within this\ndefinition is a kernel of\ntruth: a western must deal\nwith characters facing up\nagainst a harsh landscape,\nupon which they stake\ntheir claim.\nIn that respect, Lean\non Pete, the latest film\nfrom British director\nAndrew Haigh, is most\ncertainly a Western. At its\ncentre is Charley (Charlie\nPlummer), a 15-year-old\nliving in Portland with his\nfather; abandoned by his\nmother, and essentially\nleft to raise himself by\nhis father, Charlie begins\nworking for Del (Steve\nBuscemi), a cynical\nhorse-racer whose\nhorizons are dwindling.\nAfter he finds out his\nfavourite horse, Lean on\nPete, is bound for the glue\nfactory, he \u2018liberates\u2019 the\nanimal, and the two begin\ntheir epic journey across\nAmerica.\nThe shift into a Western\nis a surprise for Haigh. His\nbreakout film, Weekend,\nfocussed on the first 48\nhours in the relationship\nbetween two men in\nNottingham; introspective\nand humanistic, it resembled some of the best work\nby Richard Linklater, and\nbecame a landmark drama\nwithin queer cinema. His\non Pete, however, due\nto its narrative structure,\nconsists of not so much\na dialogue, but rather a\nsoliloquy from Charley,\ndelivered to the horse and\nthe land and the sky. It\u2019s\na risk by Haigh, one that\nleaves relative newcomer\nPlummer the chance of\nbeing over-exposed; while\nthis vulnerability is the\ndesired effect, there was\nno guarantee that it would\nbe the outcome. Luckily,\nfor both Haigh and the\naudience, it works.\nBuscemi is similarly\nbrilliantly wry and bitter\nas Del, and he is ably\nsupported by Chloe\nSevigny, who appears as\na burnt-out jockey, whose\ncareer has been marked by\na series of injuries. While\nit might be surprising to\nsee two actors so associated with New York be\ntransplanted to Oregon,\nbut both manage to make\ntheir characters feel real\nand lived-in.\nThe film belongs,\nhowever, to Plummer. At\nonly18,theassurancewith\nwhich he handles his difficult role is exceptional;\ndespite facing on extreme\nhardships, Plummer never\nallows the audience to\nforget that, underneath it\nall, his character is still\nessentially a child, one\nwho will struggle to deal\nwith his experiences once\nthe credits roll. Haigh,\nsimilarly, who adapted\nthe script from a novel by\nWilly Vlautin, highlights\nthe harsh nature of the\nAmerican wilderness,\ncentring on the bleak,\ninhospitable, beautiful\nterrain.\nThe imagery used in\nHaigh\u2019s films have been\nundergoing a period of\ntransformation from the\nintimate to the expansive;\nlike the Eames\u2019 Power\nof Ten, Haigh has been\nslowly pulling away,\nmoving away from close-ups into a more monumental exploration of\nnature. Weekend, filmed\npulls out dramatically, in\nan exuberant celebration\nof the Interior West. The\nboy and his horse become\nsmall figures, crushed\nbetween the twin horizontals of sky and land \u2013 two\nlimitless expanses that are\nsimultaneously freeing\nand oppressive.\nDespite a slight bagginess to the film, which\ncould have been edited\ndown slightly, particularly\ntowards the end, Lean on\nPete marks three for three\nfor Haigh, who is able\nto bring his humanistic\nfilm-making to any genre.\nLean on Pete will evoke\ncomparisons to the work\nofKellyReichardt\u2013Haigh\nis as adept as Reichardt\nat capturing the twin\nloneliness and freedom\nof the natural world \u2013 but\nas Haigh continues his\ndirectorial journey, it\u2019s\nexciting to see where he\nmight land next.\nAndrew Haigh\u2019s latest release is a new direction for the filmmaker, but sees him expanding his horizons for a\nmodern-day western.\nA boy and his horse // A24\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Andrew Haigh. Script:\nAndrew Haigh. Starring:\nCharlie Plummer, Chlo\u00eb\nSevigny, Travis Fimmel,\nSteve Buscemi. 122 minutes\nLEAN ON PETE\n\u201cThe shift\ninto Western\nis a surprise\nfor Haigh,\nfollowing his\nprevious work\u201d\nfollow-up, 45 Years took\nthe opposite approach to\nrelationships and time,\nwith Tom Courtenay\nand Charlotte Rampling\nplaying a couple about\nto celebrate their 45th\nwedding anniversary,\nwhose lives are disrupted\nby the emergence of a\nhidden secret. With Lean\non Pete, a much more\nsprawling work, in a completely different setting,\nHaigh is setting himself a\nchallenge.\nWhile Haigh\u2019s last two\nfilms have focussed on\nthe relationships between\nindividuals, and the\nintimacy that can develop\n\u2013 both over hours and\nyears. Central to his work\nis what his characters say \u2013\nor, in the case of 45 Years,\nwhat is left unsaid. Lean\n\u201cThe imagery\nin Haigh\u2019s\nfilms have\nundergone a\ntransformation\nfrom intimate\nto expansive\u201d\nmostly within cramped\nconfines of flats and cars\nand clubs and buses, was\na study of interiors. In\n45 Years, meanwhile,\nthe domestic interior of\nthe couple\u2019s house was\njuxtaposed against the\nflat, misted landscapes of\nNorfolk \u2013 as evocative\nas any Yorkshire moor.\nWith Lean on Pete, Haigh\n\n"

In the Wearable\nTechnology Show, 2018,\nbioengineers proposed\nanother solution \u2013 virtual\nreality (VR).\nUp until now, VR has\nbeen closely associated\nwith video games. It\ndid take years for this\nassociation to be made\ndue to the limitations of\nthe technology but, over\nthe past few years, top\ntechnology companies\nlike Facebook and HTC\nhave invested billions of\ndollars in hardware and\ncemented this association.\nAs the technology for VR\nhas developed enough\nto produce games that\nengage gamers, scientists\nquestioned why it couldn\u2019t\nbe used to engage patients\nFelix reports: Wearable Technolgy Show 2018\nVirtual Reality \u2013 the\nshift from gaming to\nhealthcare\nCurrent therapy for\npsychological phenomena\nlike anxiety, depression,\nand addiction involves\ngoing to a therapist on\na regular basis (maybe\nonce a week) and talking\nwith them about your\nprogress. They would\nsuggest treatment goals\nand tips that could help\nmanage your problem\nand you can try them out\nduring the week. Based on\nyour observations of your\nmental state, you would\nreport back during your\nnext appointment on how\nsuccessful the tips were. It\ncould also involve medi-cation. While this process\nworks for some people, it\ndoesn\u2019t for others.\nin a similar manner and\nhelp them deal with their\npsychological issues. The\nidea behind VR therapy\nVR, the patient can try out\ndifferent ways in which\nthey can cope with their\nfear of spiders while being\nexposed to one.\nWhile some might\nargue that the scenario\nfaced with theVR technology is obviously fake and\nthat the computer graphics\naren\u2019t realistic enough\nto effectively simulate\nreal life, scientists argue\nthat this is actually the\ngreatest strength of\nusing VR technology for\ntherapy. Research shows\nthat the physiological\nsymptoms experienced by\nthe patient in response to\nthe VR scenario are just\nlike the ones experienced\nin response to the same\nscenario in real life. With\nrespect to the photoreal-ism of the VR scenario,\nresearch shows there is\nno correlation between\nphotorealism and learning\ntransfer. Also, photoreal-ism is commercially very\nhard to achieve and takes\na lot of time and money.\nAnother drawback is that\npatients would mistrust\nthe technology when they\nknow the scenario is fake\nbut is starting to look real,\nwhich would hamper their\nprogress in the therapy.\nWhile the VR technology sounds like it is a good\nfit for helping cope with\nphobias, scientists don\u2019t\nwant to stop there. Many\nbelieve that the future\nof VR technology lies\nin other aspects such as\ntreatment for psychosis,\ndepression, drug addiction and substance abuse.\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive\nlist \u2013 there are many\nother interesting uses of\nit. VR technology offers\ntherapists and psychologists ways to experiment\nwith scenarios that can\u2019t\notherwise be conducted\nin clinics, due to ethical,\nfinancial, or social limita-tions.\nOne way scientists\npropose to change a\ntypical therapy meeting\nwith VR is by introducing\nthe concept of Immersive\nTherapy. This is a therapy\nintervention rigorously\nconducted over a day. The\npatient is exposed to the\nVR scenario for a certain\nperiod of time. Then, they\ndiscuss with the therapist\nabout possible coping\nmechanisms and how successful they were during\nthe time spent in VR.\nAfter a period of relaxa-tion, the patient and the\ntherapist reconvene to go\nonto the next step. It is hypothesized that this could\nreduce the relapse rate, as\nreflections on the success\nof coping mechanisms are\ndone immediately, instead\nof after a couple of days.\nGadgets you can wear every day were a hot topic \u2013 here is a keyboard made entirely out of fabric // Geek News Central\nTECH\nRobert Jin and\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Writers\n\u201cUsing VR, the\npatient can try\nout different\nways in which\nthey can cope\nwith their fear\nof spiders\u201d\nAn closer look at the future of wearables, reporting live from London\u2019s ExCeL.\n\u201cVR\ntechnology is\nprogrammed\nto make the\npatient feel\nexposed\u201d\n\u201cUp till\nnow, VR has\nbeen closely\nassociated\nwith video\ngames\u201d\nOne of the problems\nwith this current approach\nis that the time duration\nbetween consecutive\nappointments give opportunities for the client\nto do nothing. Change is\nscary and fraught with\nuncertainty \u2013 it is hard\nto accept the need for\ntherapy and harder to find\nthe willpower to stick\nthrough the long process.\nIn many cases, suggested\nstrategies may prove to be\nis that the VR technology\nis programmed to display\nsituations that make the\npatient feel exposed and\nuncomfortable. These\nare situations that one\nnormally wouldn\u2019t put\nthemselves in but the fact\nthat it\u2019s VR and not reality\nprovides a metaphorical\nsafety net for the patient.\nA simple example of\nthis in practice: an arach-nophobe might be exposed\nto multiple spiders during\na therapy session using\nVR technology. Using the\nplayable electric keyboard\nembroidered into cloth\nand controlling a toy car\nwith your brain waves,\nto training firefighting\nthrough VR goggles,\nsome of this technology\ncould find its way into\nyour life sooner or later.\nThe three main categories exhibited were\nA u g m e n t e d / Vi r t u a l\nWhile this article\nmainly discussed the use\nof VR technology in ther-apies, it also has a possible\napplication in training\ndoctors.

And not just\nfor you, but sensors on\npet and livestock collars\ncan allow monitoring of\ntheir health and tracking\nactivity, for your dog or\na farmer checking on\nhis cows.

A watch, ring,\nor even fake fingernail.\nThese all already exist\nbut companies are developing the proper support\nand payment protocols\nto enable and expand\npayment capability.\nOne particular wearable\nis a light sensor to monitor\nhow light exposure is affecting your sleep and life.\nIt was developed by LYS\ntechnologies, founded by\nImperial graduate Christina Petersen. After raising\nover \u00a350,000 on Kickstarter, it is now available\nfor sale, and a newer\nversion of its sensor was\nshowcased at the show.\nA good section of the\nshow was dedicated to\nshowcasing the technology and applications\nof conductive fabric/\nyarn. It would allow the\nplacing of thin electronics\nand conduction through\nclothing and remove the\nneed for external wires.\nFrom fun applications\nsuch as built-in lights\nin dresses and heated\nclothing, to flexible\nsensors in socks, sleeves,\nand shirts, there may be\nchallenges to consider\nbefore mass-production,\nsuch as washability and\ndurability in use.\nUnless you already own\na few smart wearables,\nand enjoy being an early\nadopter of technology,\nmost of these products\nfill niches that the usual\nWTS 2018 marked a 5-year anniversary for this Lonodn-based technology showcase // Akuaroworld\n\u201cSoon you\nmay be able to\npay through\nan NFC chip\nbuilt into...\nanything\u201d\n\u201cSo where\nis the world\nof wearable\ntechnology\nheading\ntowards?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe your\nnext shoes\nor jacket will\ncome with\nsensors\u201d\nReality, smart sensors and\nconductive fabric/yarn.\nSize and looks are the\nbig concerns for current\nconsumer wearables, but\nless so in a working envi-ronment, foregoing them\nperson won\u2019t need, and\nrequire some finesse\nbefore being able to be\nmarketed commercially.\nBut who knows, maybe\nyour next pendant, shoes\n,or jacket will come\nsensors and smart func-tions!\n\n"

One aspect of\nmy editorship that I hadn\u2019t\nreally expected was how\nfinding out what\u2019s going\non around College can be\nboth exciting and exasperating \u2013 this week\u2019s cover\nstory, about the Greening\nImperial report perfectly\nencapsulates this divide.\nWe first heard about the\nGreening Imperial initiative way back in October\ntime, when I was still a\nfresh-faced baby editor,\nrather than the grizzled\nhusk you have now. I got\nin touch with one of the\norganisers, Dan, and we\nmet for a coffee to chat\nabout the project. We\nwere both super excited\nabout the initiative, which\nwould take a look at how\nImperial is currently\nworking on sustainability,\nthe environment, and\nclimate change, as well\nas what they could do to\nimprove.\nAs time went on, things\ngot a bit delayed, as these\nbig projects often do, but\nnow the report has finally\nbeen released \u2013 hooray!\nHere at Felix, we spent\nour weekend reading and\ndigesting the full 100 page\nbeast, so you wouldn\u2019t\nhave to. And here\u2019s where\nthe exciting/exasperating\nbit comes in: it\u2019s really\nexciting that such a project\nis going forward, and that\nthe team were able to lay\nout a series of structured,\nsensible ideas for how to\nmake sure Imperial is one\nof the leading lights in\nenvironmentalism \u2013 not\nonly within the university\nsector, but across all areas.\nHowever, what\u2019s exasperating is how little has\nbeen done so far. Despite\nall the research into\nsustainability and climate\nchange that academics\nat Imperial are sending\nout across the world,\nwhen it comes to our own\npractices, we desperately\nneed to get our house in\norder. 141st\nin the People\nand Planet League Tables.\nAn increase in greenhouse\ngas emissions since 2009.\nA spike in electricity\nusage by 15% over four\nyears. Continued use of\nplastic cutlery and cups,\ndespite the damage this\nwaste can have on the\noceans.

It now needs\nto go through planning\nstages; people in the Blue\nCube need to approve\nthe changes, and all of us\nacross the campus need to\npitch in to help. And that\u2019s\nwhere you and I come in.\nThese changes won\u2019t be\nmade unless we demand\nthem, keeping up pressure\non the College and holding\nthem to account.\nChanging the world\nneeds to start somewhere.\nPlease recycle this Felix.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

Life is inconvenient and the stuff that throws us out of sorts doesn\u2019t always happen\nwhen we\u2019re best equipped to handle them. In fact, it\u2019s often the opposite. So this exam season, if you\u2019re going through something that\u2019s making it\nextra hard to cope, we need you to know two things: it\u2019s okay to not be okay, and we\u2019re here for you.\nImperial College Union employs full time professional caseworkers in our Advice Centre to handle the kinds of problems you may be experiencing.\nThey are completely confidential and will provide as much or as little support as you require. The Advice Centre handles mitigating circumstances,\nappeals, money issues, legal woes, or anything which may affect your performance or ability to prepare.\nSo go ahead, send us an email at advice@imperial.ac.uk, drop by the Union (Level 2), or visit imperialcollegeunion.org/exams.\n#icuHereforYou,\nImperial College Union\nP\n.S. We\u2019re also giving away exam goodies every Monday this month. Find us lunchtime in Central Library at South Kensington for ear plugs, energy\nbars, water bottles and breakfast tea. It\u2019s our way of showing we care and to help make studying easier.\nOh no, not another election!We hear you. But Democracy is one of our key values and that means giving all students the chance to lead the change\nand have their say. Summer Elections are a chance to do that across a range of positions affecting student life, including Liberation, Constituent\nUnions, our Academic & Wellbeing Representation Networks and our biggest Clubs, Societies and Projects.\nThe full range of positions will be available online when nominations open next Wednesday 16 May. The nomination period closes 23 May, while\nvoting will run fromTuesday 29 May to Friday 1 June.\nIf you\u2019re planning to stand, manifestos will be due onThursday 24 May, with campaigning set to begin on Friday 25 May.\n#leadthechange\nSummer\n\n"

They\u2019re going for the same upbeat, slapstick song this year\nwith \u2018My Lucky Day\u2019 which was produced by Russian superstar Philipp Kirkorov and performed by the trio DoReDos (no clue\nwhere this name comes from). No one thought all that much about it before the show, but the staging is sorta fun and makes\nyou forget the trash lyrics. Moldova could very well pull out another top ten performance this year.\nUnder The Ladder - M\u00c9LOVIN\nThis is weird in many respects. The song is, apparently, in English but I can\u2019t understand a word. The guy\u2019s stage name is\n\u2018Melovin\u2019which is apparently an amalgamation of\u2018Alexander McQueen\u2019and\u2018Halloween\u2019, but don\u2019t ask me how that works. His\naesthetic is vampire chic and his performance sees him emerging from a coffin-like piano. He\u2019s got a coloured contact lens in\none eye making him look terrifying. I could list more but you\u2019ll see for yourself on Saturday. Despite all the weirdness, this is\nsomething of a fan favourite and admittedly really quite catchy.\nViszl\u00e1t ny\u00e1r \u2013 AWS\nHungary like to send something a bit different to the competition, and this year is no exception. After winning preselection\nshow A Dal, the metal group AWS were chosen to represent Hungary with the song\u2018Viszl\u00e1t ny\u00e1r\u2019. This is a fairly polarising entry\nand will immediately turn some people off due to how screamy it is. The song title means\u2018Goodbye Summer\u2019in Hungarian and\nis about the lead singer\u2019s loss of his father (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu right?). You can really feel the pain in the screams and, just as you\u2019re about\nto get emotional, you see the guitarist dive into the stage and forget all about it.\nLea Sirk \u2013 Hvala, ne!\nHvala,ne? More like hvala,ye! Lea Sirk wrote the song\u2018Hvala, ne!\u2019(\u2018No thanks!\u2019) is about the fakers in the world, and the people\nwho try to tell others how they should live their lives. This is an upbeat Slovenian language song complete with dance routine\nthat Lea delivers fiercely. No one really expected her to qualify, but against all odds \u2013 here she is! And I think she definitely\ndeserves her place there. Also, keep an ear out for the break in the song \u2013 she\u2019s using the cheapest gimmick there is, pretending\nthe music has stopped working\u2026\nOutlaw In\u2018Em \u2013 Waylon\nWaylon is certainly no stranger to the Eurovision stage having come second in 2014 as part of the group The Common\nLinnets. Fast forward four years and he was announced to be representing The Netherlands again with the song \u2018Outlaw In\n\u2018Em\u2019which is a country/rock song claiming that\u201ceveryone\u2019s got a little outlaw in\u2018em\u201d. Due to this message in the song, you can\nimagine why some controversy started to brew around the stage performance when it transpired that Waylon is accompanied\nby four African-American dancers \u2013 a staging choice which left people wondering if they were meant to represent the outlaws?\nSanja Ili\u0107 & Balkanika \u2013 Nova Deca\nSerbia has brought one of the strongest ethnic feeling songs, in a year with the highest number of songs sang in languages\nother than English, with their song\u2018Nova Deca\u2019which means\u2018New Children\u2019in Serbian.The song is an ode to the next generation,\nwith a hopeful feeling of creating a new world together. The group were one of the most fun on the promo tour before the\ncompetition, always willing to take an interview and give fun new renditions of songs\nRasmussen \u2013 Higher Ground\nDanish broadcaster DR had the idea of creating a song about peace and waving the white flag, and what better way for a\nScandinavian country to do this other than with Vikings! They were after someone with the right look (i.e. big beard and big\nhair) to give the performance, and they found singer and stage actor Rasmussen to play the part. The one word that comes\nto mind when watching the stage show is \u2018testosterone\u2019, as Rasmussen is accompanied by four equally haired men providing\n(slightly demonic) backing vocals and\u2018Viking walking\u2019.\nThe Acts: Part II\nF\nINLAND\nIRELAND\nCYPRUS\nNORWAY\nSWEDEN\nAUSTRAL\nI\nA\nMonsters \u2013 Saara Aalto\nSaara Aalto describes herself as a Finnish snow fairy, although I describe her as MY QUEEN. Fans of the UK X Factor might\nrecognise the name \u2013 Saara got second place in the show in 2016 after she repeatedly wowed judges with her amazing voice\nand bonkers performances. She\u2019s no stranger to second place, having come second in all five TV talent shows she\u2019s competed\nin including two previous attempts at representing Finland in Eurovision. She was chosen this year with her song\u2018Monsters\u2019\u2013\na really upbeat song about facing your problems head on and \u201cmaking friends with all the creatures hiding there under your\nbed\u201d. Some wrote her off as a fan-favourite flop, but my girl slays her performance every time and sailed into the final.\nFuego \u2013 Eleni Foureira\nYeah, yeah, fire! Eleni Foureira is the sizzling hot Albanian born, Greek singer representing Cyprus this year who\u2019s now climbed\nto first in the betting odds to win. Last year, when Salvador Sobral won for Portugal, his winning message was about\u2018fast food\nmusic\u2019and that\u2018music is not fireworks; music is feeling\u2019but Eleni apparently didn\u2019t get this memo and is serving us some fierce\nhair flicking, sassy realness \u2013 fireworks and all. Is this the best song in the world? No. Have we heard many songs just like this\nbefore? Yes, but Eleni brings it to life on stage and could very well walk away with the title. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation\nwhether or not Cyprus would actually be able to host the contest last year, with financial constraints and lack of venues and\naccommodation potentially getting in the way.\nDance You Off \u2013 Benjamin Ingrosso\nBenjamin Ingrosso won Melodifestivalen, the Swedish selection show, with his funky, 80s throwback song\u2018Dance You Off\u2019. I\u2019ll\nbe honest with you, I have no clue what it means to dance someone off, but I\u2019m pretty sure that he\u2019s getting over some girl by\ndoing it. Sweden is a Eurovision powerhouse having placed in the top five six out of seven times since 2011, and their success\nis often due to effective staging. We\u2019ve seen them bring interactive projection shows, dance routines on treadmills (think OK\nGo) and this year we have a charming Michael Jackson wannabe thrusting his hips on a background of light tubes which,\nsurprisingly, works.\nTogether \u2013 Ryan O\u2019Shaughnessy\nRyan O\u2019Shaughnessy might be a familiar name to people in the UK having come fifth in Britain\u2019s Got Talent in 2012, and now\nhe\u2019s returned to the spotlight, already creating a stir as being a shock qualifier from semi-final one. His song\u2018Together\u2019is a cute,\nthough slightly repetitive, break-up song that Ryan wrote about two friends of his. The song itself is slightly meh but its music\nvideo showcases gay love story with two men dancing through the streets of Dublin at night and was embraced warmly by\nEurovision\u2019s large LGBTQ+ fan base. They replicated this story on stage and created a moment that propelled them into the\nfinals despite many expectations. Fun fact: Ryan\u2019s uncle Gary O\u2019Shaughnessy represented Eurovision in 2001 and came 21st\n.\nThat\u2019s How You Write a Song \u2013 Alexander Rybak\nRybak very convincingly won the whole thing in 2009 with\u2018Fairytale\u2019, and after nine years of maturing (though not physically\nageing apparently \u2013 how does someone stay looking so young?) and to think of a new winner, he\u2019s come back with a cheesy,\nnonsensical, though admittedly catchy song that would be better suited to the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Norway have\nhad a run of top ten entries since 2014 (except for the sad blip in 2016 #JusticeForAgnete), and this seems set to follow that trend\nbeing the bookies\u2019second favourite to win. The song is akin to a WikiHow article about how to write a song, and apparently it\ntakes just two steps! Step 1: believe in it; step 2: roll with it. Who knew song writing was so easy!\nWe Got Love \u2013 Jessica Mauboy\nWe\u2019re four years into Australia\u2019s run at Eurovision and I think it\u2019s about time we drop the questions about why they\u2019re in the\ncompetition SO I AIN\u2019T GONNA TALK ABOUT IT. They have pulled out a top ten finish in every competition they\u2019ve competed\nin so far - are they on track to maintain this record? At one point, everyone thought so but people aren\u2019t really sure anymore.\nJessica Mauboy is a fairly big deal in Australia, and her song \u2018We Got Love\u2019 sounds almost perfectly made for Eurovision with\nmessages about love, love, peace, peace. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t really translating on the stage and people have been left\nunderwhelmed with the performance. But she is a seasoned performer and could very well pull it out of the bag on the night.\n\n"

It\u2019s a\nbit of a controversial question and\nto some people, usually\n\u201cold\u201d people and art\ncritics, it\u2019s no question at all. One of the\nbiggest voices against\nconsidering games as\nart was the film critic\nRoger Ebert who battled\nagainst the perception of\nvideo games becoming\nart all the way to his\ndeath. His argument was\nthat no one in any field\nhad been able to name\na game worthy of comparison with great poets,\nauthors, and filmmakers.\nThe dictionary\ndefinition of art is \u201cthe\nexpression or application\nof human creative skill\nand imagination\u201d. With\nthis simple definition, it\nbecomes easy to consider\nvideo games as art;\n\u201cVideo games\nincorporate\nseveral pieces\nof art and\ncreation\ntogether into\nsomething\nnew\u201d\n\u201cGame\ndevelopers\nhave gone out\nof their way to\nadd creative\ntouches\u201d\nmore complex. Artists\nwork with the intention\nof creating art and\nexpressing themselves.\nIn contrast, video game\ndesigners, arguably,\nintend to craft. Designers\nput into consideration\nthings like how to push\nthe creation to as many\npeople as possible and\npublicize it. While games\nmust be creative and\ndistinctive, their purpose\nis usually to make money.\nWhile this isn\u2019t bad in of\nitself, it could conceivably\ntake away from being an\nart form.\nCompared to most\nother \u201ccritically defined\u201d\npieces of art, video games\nare a medium of mediums.\nThey have unique\ngraphics with an array\nof 2D and 3D models as\nwell as immersive stories\nand unique soundtracks\nand effects. If they are\nan art, they\u2019re one that\u2019s\nunique to digital space\nand are an amalgamation\nof art and science. Video\ngames incorporate several\npieces of art and creation\ntogether to make something new and unique that\ntranscends the limits of\nany one type.\nVideo games are inherently interactive and,\nfor some, art is usually a\npassive medium, in that\nit requires you to observe\nand reflect on what you\nexperience. However, by\nthe very act of interpreta-tion, art arguable becomes\ninteractive. Games are\ndesigned with a set of\nrules and are restricted to\nthe limitations imposed\nby the designer. However,\nthere is still a realm of\nfreedom and possibility\nthat a gamer is able to\nmake their own. Through\nhow you play, how you\nexplore, and how you\nreact, the gaming experience becomes a personal\none. Super Mario Brothers\ncan recreate the childlike\nwonder in exploring a\ncolorful world, whereas\nThat Dragon, Cancer can\nmake you experience the\nhopelessness of losing\na child. I personally\ncried my eyes out at the\ntouching and melancholic\nstory of To The Moon.\nAnd if you\u2019ve found a\npersonal connection with\nthe work of another, then\nthe purpose of art has\nbeen achieved.\nAs technology is no\nlonger a significant limitation now as it was in\nthe past, game developers\nhave gone out of their way\nto add creative touches in\norder to add to the expe-rience. These deliberate\nconstraints can include\nlimited controls, muted\ncolour palettes or abstruse\nrenderings; all of which\nserve to enhance the\nnarrative and the emotion\nexperienced. Some noteworthy examples are,\nThomas was Alone where\nthe minimalist aesthetic\nmade you feel more of a\nconnection to geometric\nshapes, and Limbo where\nthe dark, silhouetted\nuniverse created a feeling\nof mystery and unease.\nDue to the fact that\nvideo games require effort\nand attention to immerse\nyourself in, it makes it\neasy for non-gamers to\ndismiss the medium.\nMovies last around two\nhours and books may\ntake a few days to read.\nBy contrast, some video\ngames need around forty\nhours of dedication to get\nthe complete experience.\nSome people also prefer\npassive forms of enter-tainment, not wanting to\nbother with even a short\ngame; their loss at the end\nof the day.\nVideo games can do\nso much. They reflect the\nworld, challenge societal\nideas, make us question\nourselves and our morality\nor, in the case of Super\nSmash Brothers, bring\npeople together (or maybe\ntear friendships apart with\nthis particular example).\nWhile some people may\ndisagree, video games are\ndefinitely a dominant art\nform for the 21st\ncentury,\nand will likely continue to\nbe so for times ahead.\nLimbo\u2019s dark world creates a haunting atmosphere // Playdead\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nAdmiring and immersing yourself in the art. // Dotnod Entertainment\nhowever, not all games\nmay meet this criteria.\nThe additional subtleties\nbehind the creation\nof games makes their\nclassification as art a bit\n\n"

Science\nWriter Sanziana Foia explains how his brilliance stems from a non-conformist spirit and a playful attitude.\nSCIENCE\nSanziana Foia\nScience Writer\n\u201cAs Feynman\nsaid: along\nwith curiosity,\ndisrespect\nwas the most\nimportant\nthing his\nfather taught\nhim\u201d\nR\nichardFeynman,\nborn on the 11th\nof May 1918\nin New York,\nis one of the greatest\nphysicists and science\ncommunicators of all\ntimes. He is best known\nfor his work in the field of\nquantum electrodynamics\nand for his ingenious way\nof representing complex\nmathematics through\nsimplified diagrams.\nHowever, his contribution\nto science is more than a\nseries of discoveries. It is\nabout the human \u2013 or more\nspecifically, how the fears,\nthe joys, and the ambitions\nof the human led to those\nbreakthroughs. Can one\nmind change society? Can\nthe genius, the principles,\nand the choices of a single\nperson all converge to lead\nto great discoveries and\ngiant scientific progress?\nIn the summer of 1945,\nayoungmanwaswatching\nthrough a truck\u2019s windshield something no one\nelse dared to view with\nthe naked eye. Only he\nsaw the blinding light and\nthe deadly cloud rising\nfrom what was the first\natomic bomb in history.\nHowever, in the shadow of\nhis beloved wife\u2019s recent\ndeath, the joy of success\nwas suddenly followed\nby disturbance. The race\nhe had embarked to save\nhis country had a side\nhe did not contemplate\nbefore, but that eventually\ngrew too prominent to\noverlook \u2013 Hiroshima and\nNagasaki, two names that\nbecame synonymous with\n\u2018destruction\u2019 in the young\nscientist\u2019s vocabulary.\nIn the aftermath of the\ngenocide he realised he\ncontributed to, Feynman\nmade himself a life-chang-ing promise: he vowed\nhe would never again\nuse science to provide\nhumanity with such tools,\nrather he would only\npursue it for a more selfish\nreason \u2013 for the fun of it.\nThis promise, however,\nwas going to change more\nthan one man \u2013 it was\ngoing to change mankind.\nDeciding what is right\nRichard Feynman\nwas born in New York\nCity, growing up through\nthe Great Depression.\nHis father worked in a\ncompany that manufactured uniforms for the\nmilitary, which made him\ndevelop a strong distrust\nof authority. He thought\nhumans should only be\nadmired for what they\n\u201cespecially did\u201d and not\nbecause of their \u201cname\nand position \u2013 their\nuniform\u201d. As Feynman\nlater stated: together with\ncuriosity, disrespect was\nthe most important thing\nhis father taught him.\nIt allowed him to place\nhimself and his thinking\nabove social norms and\nhierarchies, turning him\ninto a nonconformist.\ncould eventually turn into\nsomething destructive.\nHowever, he recalled he\nused to enjoy physics, and\nbecause he \u201cused to play\nwith it, it was never very\nimportant\u201d. This decision\nof only approaching\nscience with ludicrous\ncuriosity, and solely for\npersonal entertainment,\nmade him even more\nof a nonconformist in\nthe world of science,\nand shaped his style of\nenquiry.\nNonconformity fuels\ncreativity\nIndividuals with an\nindependent concept of\nthemselves are stimulated\nby standing out and being\nseen as separate from\nothers. Insensitive to\nisolation, they place little\nvalue on belonging to a\ngroup, and so renounce all\ntheconstraintsthatprevent\nthem from thinking by\ntheir own rules within an\nenvironment that demands\nconformity. Exploring\nunusual or controversial\nideas, which pose a high\nrisk of being rejected or\nnot being understood by\nthe scientific community,\nled to some of the most\ncreative solutions and\ntruly, some of the world\u2019s\ngreatest discoveries. This\nwas also the case with\nAlbert Einstein, who revolutionised physics through\nhis theory of general\nrelativity, first proposed\nto an incredulous public.\nAnother example is\nOswald Avery, who was\nthe first to state that,\ncontrary to the general\nscientific opinion, genetic\nmaterial was represented\nby DNA and not proteins.\nFeynman was a nonconformist as \u201che did not\nneed the external validation of having everybody\nrespecting him all the\ntime\u201d. His manner of disregarding the opinion of\nthose around him, which\nwas primarily instilled by\nhis father, enabled him\nto assert his ideas in entourages that were likely\nto dismiss them. It is this\nattitude that allowed him,\nfor instance, to become\none of the most valued\ndebate partners for Niels\nBohr. As Feynman said,\nonce he was made to talk\nabout physics, he would\nforget about all social\nsubtleties. That is why\nhe pointed out any flaws\nin the thinking of Bohr,\nmaking him very appreci-ated, though not liked, by\nthe great physicist.\nBut most important\nfor Feynman was \u2013 as he\nhad promised himself \u2013 to\nplay, guided by what was\n\u201cinteresting, fun and right\nto do\u201d. He took a sabbatical year to study viruses\nand ants, a decision fuelled\npurely by his refusal to\nconstrain his passions. He\nalso took drawing classes,\nmuch to his colleagues\u2019\ndiscontentment, who\nthought he was \u201cwasting\nhis time\u201d and gift for\nPhysics. When the time\ncame to be nominated for a\nNobel Prize, he scorned it,\nsaying he did not need any\nhonours. \u201cThe pleasure of\nfinding the thing out, the\nkick in the discovery, and\nthe observation that other\npeople use it\u201d was the\nonly prize he needed. This\nplayful curiosity, coupled\nwith anti-authoritarian\nvalues, projected over\nhis style of enquiry. His\nunconventional mode of\napproaching problems\nexcited his creativity,\nwhich meant he could\narrive to solutions in an\nunprecedented manner\nFeynman in the centre, at Los Alamos // Wikimedia\nAs a successful MIT\ngraduate and remarkable\nPrinceton PhD student,\nhe was recruited to join\nthe Manhattan Project at\na secret laboratory in Los\nAlamos. The US feared\nGermanywouldbethefirst\nto invent the atomic bomb\nand that they would win\nWorld War II to become a\ndominant power. This was\na defeat the US could not\nafford, so the project was\nput in place, taking on the\nbrightest physicists of the\ntime. Feynman strongly\nfelt it was part of his duty\nas a citizen, so accepted\nthe job, and was integral\nin helping the team speed\nup their calculations.\nAmerica did win the\natomic bomb race and \u2013\nwith that \u2013 the war. But\nthe fact that he contributed to the deaths of so\nmany individuals deeply\ndisturbed Feynman \u2013 the\nwhole race had not been\nworthwhile. Leaving for\nCornell University to\nbecome a professor in the\nPhysics department \u2013 and\nstill shaken by the events\nof the summer \u2013 he developed anxiety about doing\nanything important that\nSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nI\nn recent years, we\nhave seen a spike\nin the number of\nfungal diseases infecting wildlife, causing\npopulation declines.\nThis includes the chytrid\nfungus in amphibians\nand white-nose syndrome in bats. Recently,\na new fungus has been\ndiscovered in the US,\nwhich so far seems to exclusively infect snakes.\nSnake Fungal Disease\n(or SFD for short) can\ninfect the eyes, nose,\nmouth, throat, and lungs,\nresulting in blindness and\ndifficulty eating for the infected snakes. In extreme\ncases there is deformation,\nwhich causes disability\nin terms of feeding.\nScientists believe SFD\nhas been around for a lot\nlonger than we have currently identified, but \u2013 for\nsome unknown reason,\nsuch as a change in the\nenvironment \u2013 the fungus\nhas become more virulent\nin recent years.\nIn the US, where the\ndisease was first discov-ered, a number of snake\nspecies have suffered\nfrom localised population\ndeclines due to SFD. It\nmay not sound important,\nbut snakes play a vital\nrole in the ecosystems\nthey inhabit, acting as a\nnatural pest control and\neven helping to reduce\nthe incidence of diseases\nlike Lyme disease. With\nthe loss of snakes in an\nenvironment, the levels of\npest species are likely to\nrise, which may lead to increased damage to human\nproperty. Unfortunately,\nSFD is not just restricted\nto the US: it has recently\nbeen found in the UK\nand the Czech Republic.\nHere in the UK it affects\nour humble grass snake\nbut the true effects of the\ndisease on populations are\nnot currently known \u2013 our\nsnakes may be more resil-ient, or they may decline\nas in the US.\nIt is important to stress\nthat the diseases listed\nabove currently only\naffect wildlife and not\nhumans, and it is very\nunlikely they will pose a\nthreat to us. Most of the\ntime, the effects of SFD in\ninfected snakes seems to\nbe fairly mild, but in some\ncases, and for reasons\nwhich we do not yet\nfully understand \u2013 it can\nbe extremely dangerous.\nThere is still a lot we need\nto learn about in terms of\nthe mechanisms of spread\nand infection of SFD. Due\nto its relatively recent\ndiscovery, there are so\nmany aspects still to learn,\nbut hopefully we will, one\nday, be able to prevent\ndeclines like those seen in\nthe US.\nGrass snakes are potentially under threat from Snake\nFungal Disease // Wikimedia\nConnectwithconservation:SnakeFungalDisease\nSometimes it is important just to play\nFeynman\u2019s unorthodox\nway of thinking stepped\nin when physics was\nconfronting with a great\ncrisis. Classical theories\nwere beginning to fail at\nexplaining or predicting\nall phenomena in the\nuniverse, as a new field\nwas emerging: Quantum\nElectro-Dynamics (QED).\nThis area of physics\ndescribes the interaction\nof light with charged\nelementary particles. By\nexplaining how these\ninteractions work, QED\nthoroughly explains\nelectromagnetism, one of\nthe fundamental forces of\nnature and of the universe.\nAs electromagnetism\nunderlies how atoms\ncome together or break\napart to form molecules, it\nexplains chemistry. And,\nas living organisms are\nthe result of a myriad of\ncomplex chemical reac-tions, electromagnetism\nis also at the base of all\nbiological processes.\nWithout a coherent\nQED theory, nature could\nnot be entirely understood.\nBut, there was a problem \u2013\nwhen the mathematics of\nQED were not becoming\ninhumanly complex, they\nappeared to be flawed.\nSome equations predicted results of infinity\nfor measurements that\nyielded finite numerical\nvalues in the laboratory \u2013 a\ncomplete contradiction. It\nwas Feynman who found\nthe underlying cause of\nthis problem, though his\nsource of inspiration was\nrather unconventional.\nA student tossed a plate\nup in Cornell\u2019s cafeteria,\nand Feynman observed\nhow the imprinted blue\ncrest of the university\nwas wobbling as the plate\nwas spinning down. He\n\u201cplayed around\u201d with the\nequations of motion until\nthey led to the similar\nproblem of the electron\u2019s\nspin in QED equations.\nRichard realised the\nequations resulting in\ninfinity did not mean they\nwere wrong, but that they\nneeded to be approached\nfrom a different per-spective. For a man who\ndecided to explore physics\nfor fun, and who did not\ncare about how his ideas\nwere going to be judged\nby fellow scientists, this\nwas the perfect task. Feynman\u2019s strange method of\ndepicting complex mathematical equations through\ndiagrams meant that the\ncomplicated calculations\nrequired by QED could be\nside- stepped.\nThough revolutionary,\nFeynman\u2019s idea was\nunfamiliar and only understood by few at first.\nAlthough some great\npersonalities of physics\nraised objections, they all\nsoon began to acknowledge the powerful tool\nthat Feynman had created,\nand which eventually\nbrought him a Nobel\nprize. QED was finally\na complete theory which\nmade meaningful predictions about the world.\nThe \u201cmost numerically\nprecise theory invented\u201d\nwas working, and it was\nall down to Richard Feynman\u2019s childish self, who\ngave no importance to the\nimplications of his work \u2013\nhe just wanted to play.\nFeynman\u2019s work has\nfound applications in\nnumerous fields that either\nexplain the world around\nus or affect our daily lives.\nFrom elucidating the\nevolution of galaxies to\ntelecommunications, from\nfundamental phenomena\nto daily life, everything\nhas QED at work. Even\nour smartphones and\ncomputers might have\nbeen science fiction today\nif it was not for a young\nheartbroken scientist who\ndecided not to ever do\nanything important, in the\nsummer of 1945.\nDo shifts within scientists affect humanity?\nNonconformity, coupled\nwith an individual concept\nof self and the mind of\na genius lead to spikes\nin creativity. Creative\nsolutions are sometimes\nfound by exploring realms\nthat are novel, unusual,\nand often get rejected by\nthe more conservative\nthinkers. The choices\nscientists make, and the\napproaches they decide\nto take when tackling a\nproblem, are reflected in\nhow they find a solution.\nA problem solved, a small\nsuccess for a single man,\ncould become a scientific\nrevolution for mankind.\nRichard Feynman approached physics in his unique style // Wikimedia\n\n"

But\nbear with me. I genuinely\nthink I have something to\nsay to say on the issue,\neven if I\u2019m trying to frame\nit as a response to Aida\u2019s\npiece two weeks ago, instead of as a long overdue\narticle on a subject which\nthe world outside of Spain\ndoesn\u2019t really care about,\nand which people inside\nof Spain are more than\ntired of seeing in the headlines over and over.\nPeople love to draw\nborders. Most people. We\nfind refuge in establishing\nboundaries at all levels of\nhuman social interaction,\nfrom small families to\nlarge countries. And it\u2019s\neasy to understand why. If\nboundaries aren\u2019t present,\nclear, well-defined groups\ncease to exist. Some\ngroups are more open than\nothers: the only barrier to\nentry for the IC chess club,\nfor the sake of an example,\nis being at least somewhat\nenthusiastic about chess,\nwhile the requirements to\nenter my local golf club\nare a bit more stringent:\nyou must personally know\na member and she has to\nrecommend you, which\nbasically means she\u2019s\njudged whether you\u2019re\nsimilar to the rest of the\nmembers in a series of\nconstructed social attrib-utes.\nEven if you consider\nyourself an open person,\nyou\u2019re still drawing\nboundaries with your\nfriends, as you\u2019ll tend to\ncall and invite the people\nyou get on with \u2014people\nwho share a similar set of\nattributes or experiences\nwith you, whatever that\nmay be. And at a higher\nlevel of resolution, boundaries between communities take the form of a\nborder between countries.\nHowever arbitrary they\nmay seem, at least most of\nthem tend to reflect a very\nold idea: that the experience of being French, for\nexample, seems to reflect\na different experience\nto that of being Swiss or\nGerman.\nThe new globalised\nworld offers a flipside to\nour traditional love for\nboundaries, manifested in\nthe form of megacities like\nLondon, which embrace\nwhat I like to call radical\nopenness: the absolute\nabsence of a barrier to\nentry in terms of any\nattribute \u2014race, culture,\ncustoms, you name it.\nStep into the tube and\nyou\u2019ll be surrounded by a\nmix of people with hugely\nvarying conceptions of\nthe world, motivations on\nhow to act on it, and ways\nin which their lives should\ndevelop. Megacities are\ninteresting experiments of\nwhat comes out of being\nradically open.\nAnd while I wouldn\u2019t\nhave space to explain the\nupsides of the existence\nof megacities\u2019 radical\nopenness, there\u2019s a big\nproblem that a bounda-ry-loving person would\npoint out. Cities like\nLondon lack boundaries\nand real borders, so their\ndefinition becomes blurry.\nThere is no clear sense\nof community and a lack\nof definition of what this\ngroup is or what it is\nfor. As a Londoner, you\ncease to become part of\nsomething and become an\nanonymous individual in\na massive jungle. People\nbecome lonely, focus\nmostly on themselves,\nand end up not knowing\nthe name of their next-door neighbour. And it\u2019s\nunderstandable. If the\nIC chess club suddenly\nhad a massive influx of\npeople to the point of a\nfifty-fold increase in their\nmembership, but none of\nthem wanted anything to\ndo with chess, something\nsimilar would happen.\nYes, the club would\nbecome very powerful in\nUnion Council meetings,\nbut a sense of what the\nclubisforwoulddiluteand\ndisappear. And probably\nthe members wouldn\u2019t get\nalong as well.\nIt is important to understand boundaries and\nopenness in order to understand the Great Catalan\nParadox. Indeed, it\u2019s hard\nto think of anything more\nparadoxical than what\nthe Catalans are trying to\ndo, which is to embrace\nradical openness while\ndrawing new borders at\nthe same time. At a time\nwhen political lines divide\nalong openness-closed-ness (Brexit or EU, protectionism or globalism,\nanti-immigration or\npro-immigration) much\nIsn\u2019t it great when football is used as a political tool? // Deviantart/Arafah\n\u201cPeople love to\ndraw borders.\nIf boundaries\naren\u2019t present,\nclear, well-defined groups\ncease to exist\u201d\n\u201cA true liberal\nparadox:\ndrawing more\nborders so\nthey can be\nmore open\u201d\nmore than along traditional left and right-wing\npolitics, the Catalan issue\nof independence seeks to\nexist in a sort of quantum\nsuperposition of both.\nBarcelona has always\nregarded itself, and been\nregarded by others, as the\nmost open, liberal city in\nSpain. A sort of Spanish\nCalifornia. Its status as an\neconomic powerhouse has\nturned it into a very cosmopolitan city. You can\nfind an immense cultural\nexchange, an insanely rich\nartistic scene, and a huge\nvariety of immigrants\nfrom differing religions\nand cultural backgrounds.\nAnd it aims to be more\nthan that. At a time when\nEU bureaucrats dream\nof creating a European\nSilicon Valley, Barcelona\nis sometimes mentioned\nas one of the potential\ncontenders. Contrast this\nopenness with the Castilian, closed, and mostly\nuniform rest of Spain led\nby conservative Madrid,\nand an eventual conflict\nmight emerge.\nAnd here it is. The\nGreat Paradox. Liberal\nBarcelona trying to\napproach more openness\nby dividing us even more\nthan we are already. An\nattempt to try to distance\nitself from the closedness\nand slightly backwards\nimage they have of Spain\n(which, to be honest,\nis a country that still\nconsiders bullfighting an\nelevated form of artistic\nexpression) by practicing\na liberal paradox: drawing\nmore borders so they can\nbe more open.\nI, however, am no one\nto decide how to solve\nthis inconsistency. This\nis up to them. How to\nembrace their own redefinition is not something\nI can answer. But I have\nFirstly, they should be\nentitled to a three-round\nreferendum. One now,\none in three years and one\nin six years. By doing this,\nthe Catalans will have\nan opportunity to show\nhow deep their dividing\nline is, and whether it\u2019s\nworth it or not. Having\nthree rounds will do two\nthings: it will ensure that\nthe heat of the moment\nis taken away \u2014making\nsure it\u2019s a vote about the\nfuture of the country and\nnot just a protest vote on\na single issue (I\u2019m looking\nat you, Brexit)\u2014 and it\nwill ensure that it\u2019s not\nan economic issue. The\nonly thing that upset me\nabout Aida\u2019s last week\narticle was the argument\nthat Catalans should have\na vote because Madrid has\nbeen a terrible manager\nof the economy since the\nrecession. This argument\nis just plainly absurd.\nRecessions happen all\nthe time, and if countries\nbroke up every time there\nwas one, there wouldn\u2019t\nbe a country left that was\nlarger than the size of my\nbackyard.\nAnd secondly, the type\nof country Catalonia\nwants to be should be\nincluded in the referen-dum. It shouldn\u2019t just be\na simple \u201cdo you want\nto be an independent\ncountry\u201d question, but\na vote on a new Catalan\nconstitution. Why?\nBecause the broadness of\npolitical thinking that lies\nwithin the independentist\nmovement is staggering.\nThis is something that\npeople tend to forget\nwhen they erroneously\ncompare the Catalan issue\nwith the Scottish issue.\nThe Scottish independence movement is pretty\nmuch led by a single\nparty, the SNP, which has\na clear social-democratic\nagenda and clear views\non most policies. Contrast\nthis to the coalition and\nsupporting parties that\nput Puigdemont into\npower. It ranges from the\nbourgeoisie conservative\nPDeCAT all the way to the\nanarchists from the CUP.\nCan anyone even pretend\nto predict what kind of\ncountry would emerge out\nof that? Clearly not. The\nconstitution must thus be\nwritten before the vote is\ntaken.\nI do have to say,\nthough, that although\nI\u2019m not a huge fan of the\nindependence movement,\nI have a deep respect for\na politician willing to go\nto jail for his ideas, such\nas Puigdemont and other\nCatalan leaders. I would\nnever even dream of a\ncharacter like that coming\nout of the Oxbridge career\npoliticians that run the UK\nor a Clinton-like figure in\nthe US. It shows that, at\nleast in some contexts,\nidealists can still gain\npower, in contrast with the\nmoney and large corporation power dynamics that\nengulfs politicians these\ndays.\na solution to how they\nshould answer these ques-tions:\nWant to be on the Felix team next year?\nFelix are recruiting new section editors and copy editors for next year!\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed reading the paper, and want to help create it each week,\napply to join the team!

For many of us this\nwas our first international\nseminar, and the first time\nwe would train and learn\nfrom our overseas coun-terparts. Shorinji Kempo\nis designed to effectively\nsubdue any attacker with\nminimal damage by\nusing acupressure and\nthe attacker\u2019s momentum\nagainst them. As a result,\nthe size of the attacker\nshould not matter when\nit comes to self-defence,\nand this was certainly\nput to the test at the IKA\n(International Kempo Association) seminar as individuals of all sizes trained\ntogether. The acupressure\ncomes in helpful later too\nas massage (seiho) is also\ntaught \u2013 helpful to soothe\nthe aching joints and\nmuscles of some of our\nmore senior kenshi.\nAs well as intense\ntraining, international\nseminars also provide an\nopportunity for everyone\nattending to socialise with\none another. This year,\nBristol Shorinji Kempo\narranged a suitably-Brit-ish boat pub crawl around\nthe city Harbour on the\nfirst night of the event, an\nevening of seeing lions\nand monkeys as well\nas a dining and dancing\nexperience at Bristol zoo,\nand a survivor\u2019s party\non the final night.

Williams.\nThe international\nseminars are held every\nyear in a different participating country of the IKA,\nwith the previous seminar\ntaking place in Spain and\nmaking the national news.\nShorinji Kempo is a\nmodern Japanese martial\nart, where striking and\nthrowing techniques are\nblended together seam-lessly with meaningful\nand practical philosophy.\nIt teaches self-confidence,\ncooperation, and mutual\nrespect. Every week we\ntrain in both hard methods\n(punches, strikes and\nkicks) and soft methods\n(releases and throws),\neventually combining the\ntwo into a beautiful and\ndynamic system of martial\npractice. Zen philosophy\nunderpins the training and\nis essential for both mental\nand physical growth.\nAs Shorinji Kempo\nis non-competitive and\nholistic, the aim of\npractice is for everyone to\nbenefit, grow stronger and\nlearn the art of self-de-fence.

Every\ngood scientist\nshould be aware of that.\nHowever, for scientists,\nscience and the scientific\nmethod have proven to be\nthe most effective ways of\nmoving towards a more\nobjective view on the\nuniverse around us. Barrie\nCondon is such a scientist.\nHe is a trained physicist.\nHe held an Honorary\nProfessorship with the\nUniversity of Glasgow\nand is the author of over\n80 papers published in\npeer reviewed journals.\nNevertheless, he\ndecided to turn his back\non his scientific background and to come out\nas a \u2018heretic\u2019. In his book\nScience for Heretics he\nsets out to undermine out\ncurrent understanding of\nphysics, mathematics, and\nbasically all of science,\nwith moderate success,\nto put it mildly. The book\nis one big mess, in which\none wild claim follows\nthe next so quickly that\nthe reader hardly has the\nchance to come to grips\nwith what has just been\nstated before the next\nclaim hits them like a\nfreight train. Apparently,\nthere is a causal link\nbetween arithmetic, the\nability to count, and the\nhorrendous mass killings\ncommitted in the Soviet\nUnion and Nazi Germany.\nIf it actually exists, then\nsomebody please explain\nit to me because I cannot\nsee it.\n\u201cSome of the\nmain problems\nCondon has\nwith science\nseems to have\ntheir origins\nin a dislike for\nabstractions\nand approximations\u201d\n\u201cCondon is\nclearly not an\nexpert in the\nphilosophy of\nscience\u201d\nAnother one is that\nmathematics does not\nwork because one plus\none never equals two.\nThis seemingly follows\nfrom the fact that two\nthings are never ever\nexactly identical. Not\neven atoms. Or at least not\nto our knowledge since we\ncannot look at every atom\nindividually. I will come\nback to this point later.\nHere the author refers to\nNietzsche in what appears\nto be a classic example\nof an out-of-context quo-tation. He speaks about\nthe concept of \u201czero\u201d as\nif it were some kind of\nspectre haunting human\nculture. The only thing\nworse than zero is infinity,\nand of course, Fourier\ntransforms. Be afraid of\nFourier transforms. Very\nafraid.\nSome of the main\nproblems Condon has\nwith science seems to\nhave their origins in a\ndislike for abstractions\nand approximations.\nEven if no two things are\never the same, I can still\nimagine two things to\nbe identical. There is no\nproblem with that. This\nis an abstraction. When I\nsay there are two cups on\nthe table in front of me\nthen I do not mean two in\nevery way identical cups\nbut two things that are\nsimilar enough in their\n\u201ccupness\u201d to be classified\nas identical.\nFurthermore, approximations are ubiquitous\nin science. Every model\nin physics involves some\nsort of approximations\nand every good physicist\nshould keep them in the\nback of their head when\nderiving new theories.\nComing to the problem\nthat we are not able to\nprobe every atom indi-vidually: This is a well\nknown philosophical\nproblem called the Induction Problem. Karl Popper\nhas circumnavigated this\nproblem by saying that\nscience can only ever\nfalsify a theory but never\nverify it. Good theories\nhave to be falsifiable.\nAlthough Condon\nhas experience with the\npracticalities of science\nand knows how the scientific method is applied, he\nclearly is not an expert in\nthe philosophy of science.\nHe is so keen on stepping\nback from science and\ntrying to figure out what\nscience is actually doing,\nthat he completely misses\nwhat science is actually\ndoing. In an attempt to\noverthrow all of science\nas swiftly and long\nlastingly as possible, he\nentirely falls short of\nbeing critical about his\nown ideas. Perhaps the\nauthor should be more\nheretical in relation to his\nown theories, or the lack\nthereof. The book does\nnot convey the picture of a\ncritical inquiry of the scientific method, but rather\nthat of a blind and hysterical tirade against anything\nand anybody that aims to\nmake a logical statement\nabout the universe.\nNevertheless, as I like\nto get something positive\nout of every book I read,\nhere are some of the things\nI took away from reading\nthis book: it did make me\nthink about certain issues\nregarding how science it\nconducted. It also motivated me to read up on\nsome of the philosophical\nissues mentioned above,\nsuch as the Induction\nProblem. Although the\nbook makes for an invigorating \u2013 or sometimes\nirritating \u2013 read, I do not\nthink that it will go down\nin history as the work that\nopened the eyes of thousands of scientists to the\nbitter truth of reality.\nBe afraid of Fourier Transforms. Very afraid. // Gravure/Granger/Bridgeman Images\n\n"

These\npose an existential threat\nto the world as we know\nit. Liberal democracies\nspreading wealth and\nfreedom via free market\ncapitalism have seen their\nsupport checked by the\nlikes of Trump, Brexit and\nmost recently the elections\nin Italy where the right\nand far-right emerged as\nthe largest parties. The\nquestion is why is this\nhappening? Large swathes\nof the Western world have\nprospered through the 20th\nand into the 21st\ncentury\nwith unparalleled growth\nin living standards and\nprosperity and yet there\nare large swathes of these\npopulations, perhaps even\nmajorities, who have rebelled against this system.\nThey have flocked to\ngroups who claim they\nwill protect the nation\nand protect them from the\naliens from foreign lands.\nThey are voting for those\nwho claimthey will put the\nindigenous first and return\nthe nation to a bygone\nera of pride and glory.

The\ncentreground, especially\nthe centre-left has struggled to come to terms with\nthese developments and\nunderstand the concerns\nof the electorate, let alone\nfigure out how to meet\nthese.\nIf the old model is\nbroken beyond repair\nthen what can replace it\nto provide a sustainable\nand fruitful future? One\noption lies within the\nBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith was\nfounded by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\nroughly 150 years ago,\nmaking it one of the\nyoungest religions in the\nworld. A key theme that\nruns through the faith is\nunityandoneness.Thereis\na oneness to humanity and\nto the world. As someone\nwho does not belong to\nthe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith reflecting\non these notions in detail\nand reading further into\nthe faith has revealed a\npotentially different way\nof viewing the world.\nThis idea of oneness helps\nto identify the problems\nalready laid out in a new\nlight. The world has\nbecome quite simply too\nmaterialistic: the yearning\nto acquire wealth because\nit is inherently a good\nthing. Those who believe\nin laissez faire economics\nwould argue that the\ndesire for wealth has been\nan entirely good thing,\ndriving competition and\ninnovation. This has ultimately been to the benefit\nof all even if a minority\nbecame disproportionately rich. However, the\nBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith believe this\nas an ultimate goal does\nnot bring an individual\ntrue happiness and as\nhumanity can be seen\nthrough a lens of oneness\nthat all economic actions\nhave an intrinsic moral\nnature that impact of on\nothers and the environment around us. Therefore, wealth itself is not\nto be frowned upon and\ncriticised but the way this\nwealth is used must be to\nthe betterment of oneself\nand of others. Those less\nwell-off must also ensure\nthat that they do what they\ncan to take the burdens of\nothers in the same way\nthat the rich are compelled\nto do the same. The issue\narises as to how to bring\nthis about. The system\nrewards wealth collection so there must be a\nwholesale change to the\nglobal economic system\nwhich will take years and\nconcerted effort or the\nonus falls onto individuals\nto act in a different way\nwithin the confines of\nthe same system. The\nalternative is for the state\nto impose change from\nthe top down mandate\ncertain behaviours; this\nwould be seen as an attack\non the wealth creators of\nthe economy who drive\ngrowth.\nThe issue of economic\nbehaviour goes to the\nheart of human nature;\nare humans naturally\nself-serving units maxim-ising their own wealth or\nis there a greater capacity\nto help each other ? It\u2019s\nnot just economics where\nSerenity\u2026 // CC\nthere has been increasing\nturmoil and revolt, but\nwithin politics itself too.\nNations have regressed\nfrom being open to closed\noff with the number of\nborder walls increasing\ndramatically over the\nlast decade or so. This\narguably stems from\ngroups feeling left behind\nand pulling the brakes\non globalisation. This\nregression appears to fly\nin the face of the oneness\nof humanity. Rather than\npeople viewing themselves as citizens of the\nworld, rather people are\nlooking to nationhood\nto ground their identity\nin. This identity feeds of\nthe distinctions we create\nbetween groups rather\nthan melt them away.\nHowever, the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith\ncan put this down to the\nparallel processes of integration and disintegration.\nIn order for the new order\nto rise up the old must be\nbroken down. The world\nappears to be becoming\na nastier place filled with\nsmall, isolated nations\nheaded by those who pull\non the cult of personality to clasp onto power.\nWhile the processes of\ndisintegration are plain to\nsee, one must look closer\nto see how the processes\nof integration are taking\nhold in the form of the\ndigitalisation of information allowing people to\nconnect across the globe.\nPerhaps this system is\nwhat we are seeing at\nthe moment, however;\nI am not convinced that\nthis new world order will\nbe the world of unity the\nBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith hope to see\nanytime soon.\nAmidaresurgenceofnationalismandprotectionism,wecouldlearnsomelessonsfromBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed.\n\n"

For many of us, this is the most important time of the year \u2013 months of time\nand effort culminate in our final two-hour shot to prove our dedication to our art. Of course,\nI am talking about the Eurovision Song Contest! The iconic show, which has created massive\nartists such as ABBA and C\u00e9line Dion, is back for its 63rd\nyear. The two semi-finals happened this\nweek and we have our final twenty-six countries who will compete for the title this Saturday in\nthe Atlice Arena in Lisbon, Portugal.\nMy name\u2019s Shervin and I\u2019ll be taking you through all the highlights of this year\u2019s competition\nincluding backstage gossip from the participants, all the controversies, what to look out for\nduring the performances, and some sprinklings of my own take on things here and there.\nFor the less educated amongst you who are wondering what Eurovision is, here\u2019s some quick\nbackground: in 1956, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was looking for ways to rebuild\nwar-torn Europe through\u2018light entertainment programmes\u2019. The Eurovision Song Contest was\nconceived and the first competition was held in Lugano, Switzerland that year. It was won by\nLys Assia (R.I.P.) from Switzerland with the song\u2018Refrain\u2019. Since then, the contest has been held\nevery year, and now up to 43 countries compete every year.\nSome may say that Eurovision has lost its original meaning, and is all about politics. I\ndisagree. The show is the biggest music event of the year, and unites many countries with\nmany cultures through the common music of language. So make sure you tune in 8pm\nSaturday on BBC1 to watch all the whacky performances, exercise your professional music\nopinion to comment on everyone\u2019s vocals, and complain when Greece gives Cyprus 12 points.\nAnd, most importantly, to feel the love <3\n\n"

In order to get\ntested, students must first\nbook an appointment with\nthe Imperial Health Clinic,\nand then, after attending\nthat appointment, make\nanother appointment with\na sexual health clinic\nfor testing \u2013 a lengthy\nprocess, with bookings\nsometimes taking weeks.\nMost students do not have\nthe time or patience to\nwait that long, and therefore ignore STI testing or\nsexual health education.\nThe group also says\nthere is still stigma against\ntalks on sexual health at\nthe university. Out of the\n114 students who took\nthe group\u2019s survey on\nsexual health, 33% said\nthey would not get tested\nfor STI\u2019s if there were\ntesting services available\non campus, and 50% said\nthey are against or unsure\nabout making their partner\nget tested.\nMuch of this stigma\ncomes from cultural and\nfamily taboos of sex, and\nthe campaign wants to\nnormalize talk of sexual\nhealth. Yamamoto told\nFelix that thinking about\nsexual health and safe\nsex does not involve\njust one person, but also\nthose with whom they are\nsexually active, and it is\ntherefore imperative to\nspread awareness as much\nas they can around the\nschool.\nThe group hopes this\ncampaign is just the start\nof empowering these types\nof discussions at Imperial;\nYamamoto told Felix she\nhopes \u201cgenerations to\ncome continue pushing\nfor it to be something\u2026\nin Imperial\u2019s agenda for\nstudents.\u201d\nThe campaign will\ntake place from 11:00 to\n16:00 on Wednesday 23\nMay in rooms G23 and\nG24 in the Sir Alexander\nFleming building, and on\nWednesday 16 May in interview rooms A & B in the\nReynolds Building on the\nCharing Cross campus.\nSTI testing is done on\neach of these days, and\nonline booking through\ntheir Facebook group is\nrequired. Additionally,\nSt. Mary\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Jefferiss Wing will provide\ntake-home testing kits for\nstudents throughout May.\nStudents providing advice and supplies in SAF this week // Felix\nStudents launch Sexual Health campaign at Imperial\nNEWS\nThe page, where\nstudents could share\nanonymous posts,\nwas taken down last\nweek.\nFrank Leggett\nNews Writer\n\u201cA meeting of\nthe Union's\nCommunity\nand Welfare\nBoard had\nraised\nconcerns over\nthe page\u201d\n\u201cOne student\nsaid the page\nbrought\n'banter to the\ntough life at\nImperial'.

Eugent Bushpepa is\na fairly well known rock singer in Albania, having won the\u2018Best Male Singer\u2019category twice in Albania\u2019s\u2018Top Fest\u2019talent show.\nHe\u2019s also supported some big names on tour before such as Deep Purple, both lead guitarists of Guns N\u2019Roses and Overkill. His\nsoft-rock song\u2018Mall\u2019(that doesn\u2019t mean the same thing in Albanian as it does in English just to clarify\u2026) is about the yearning\nyou feel when you\u2019re away from the people you love, and is just a quality number. Eugent also nails some high notes that brings\nthis song to a new level, and it is a deserving qualifier.\nWhen We\u2019re Old \u2013 Ieva Zatumsikate\nNow this song is just the epitome of cuteness. Ieva is just this little ball of sweetness singing about growing old with your one\ntrue love. Her performance is beautifully simple, just her on stage with a flowing pink gown and a few subtle graphics showing\npeople with different types of love. Right at the end of the song, she walks onto one of the small bridges coming off from the\nstage and delivers the final lines \u201c(in Lithuanian) Right from our very first kiss I knew it\u2019d end up like this. (In English) I\u2019m not\nafraid to grow old if I have your hand to hold\u201djust as her husband walks by her side and holds her hand **start crying now**.\nLa Forza \u2013 Elina Nechayeva\n\u2018La Forza\u2019is an Italian language pop-opera piece delivered flawlessly by accomplished soprano Elina Nechayeva. I fell deeply\nin love with this song after watching the Estonian national final performance where Elina\u2019s out-of-this-world vocals and the\nprojection light show happening on her dress that fills the entire stage make for a magical three-minute viewing experience.\nHer journey to Lisbon was thwarted by financial difficulties since Estonian broadcaster ERR couldn\u2019t afford the \u20ac65,000 to rent\nthe projectors for the dress light show \u2013 however the dress drama came to an eventual end when sponsors were found.\nNobody But You \u2013 Ces\u00e1r Sampson\nAustria saw their first win in decades recently with the fabulous Conchita Wurst and her impressive beard. They got the\ndreaded nul point the year after but have enjoyed a couple of mid-board successes since. As for this year \u2013 I\u2019m not really sure\nwhat to say about this entry really. The song is nice, the staging is nice, the guy looks nice, his vocals are nice and that\u2019s about it\nreally. If you\u2019re looking for a toilet break song, I\u2019d recommend this one because I guarantee if you do watch it, the main things\nyou\u2019ll remember is Ces\u00e1r\u2019s gap tooth and little about the song itself.\nLie to Me \u2013 Mikolas Joseph\nIf you were ever listening to Jason Derulo\u2019s \u2018Talk Dirty\u2019 and thought \u2018I would love to hear a pretty Czech boy sing a worse\nversion of this song on the Eurovision stage\u2019 then you\u2019re in luck. I personally can\u2019t stand this song, but it\u2019s got a lot of support\nand has given Czech their second qualification in history. It hasn\u2019t been plain sailing, \u2013 following an attempted back flip in the\nfirst rehearsals, Mikolas landed himself in hospital. He got back on his feet after a few days and could potentially do well on\nSaturday. Listen to some of the\u2026 inspired lyrics in the song:\u201cplenty motherfuckers wanna eat my spaghetti\u201d.\nToy \u2013 Netta\nThere\u2019s been a craze surrounding Netta since her song dropped in March, and was firm favourite to win until a few days ago\n\u2013 she\u2019s slipped to third now. It\u2019s hard to describe \u2018Toy\u2019, really; I suppose it\u2019s an electro-pop song that makes good use of a live\nlooper, but that doesn\u2019t really do the whole thing justice. Much of the craze stems from the chicken clucking that serves as the\npre-chorus which, somehow, manages to work perfectly in the song. With lyrics like \u201cWonder Woman don\u2019t you ever forget,\nyou\u2019re divine and he\u2019s about to regret\u201d, Netta\u2019s message is one of self-empowerment for anyone who\u2019s been mistreated.\nBones \u2013 Equinox\nBulgaria have been riding a wave of good results since they returned from a two-year hiatus in 2016, placing fourth that year\nthen second last year, and they\u2019ve come back again with a solid entry.\u2018Bones\u2019is a fairly dark, ominous song about deep love that\ngoes \u2018beyond the bones\u2019. Equinox is a common framework of five singers from both Bulgaria and America created just for the\ncompetition. The single woman in the group, Zhana Bergendorff, has been the suspect of speculation during rehearsals due\nto doubts that she is actually singing in the performance. I\u2019ll admit, after watching the semi-final performance, I share them.\nThe Acts: Part I\nS\nPAIN\nITALY\nFRANCE\nGERMANY\nUK\nPORTUGA\nL\nTu Canci\u00f3n \u2013 Amaia y Alfred\nSpanish broadcaster RTE brought back to life Spanish reality show Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo, a weird cross between Big Brother and\nX Factor. Out of it came Spanish power couple Amaia and Alfred. Their Spanish language song\u2018Tu Canci\u00f3n\u2019(\u2018Your Song\u2019) is your\nquintessential love song with (translated) lyrics like \u201cfeels like I\u2019m dancing for the first time\u201d and \u201ceverything is perfect when\nyou\u2019re here\u201d. Alfred and Amaia (or, Almaia as they\u2019re called a lot) are just about as cute as a couple can get, and this translates\nonto the stage as well. Spanish Eurovision fans \u2013 who are amongst some of the most passionate \u2013 are sure this is going to win,\nbut they said that about Pastora Soler, Ruth Lorenzo, Edurne, and Barei all in the last six years so I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath.\nMercy \u2013 Madame Monsieur\n\u00c9milie Satt and Jean-Karl Lucas, the wife and husband duo creatively called Madame Monsieur, are representing France this\nyear with the hard hitting song \u2018Mercy\u2019. The song starts with \u2018Je suis n\u00e9e ce matin, je m\u2019appelle Mercy\u2019; if you hear it and think\nthis person is called \u2018thank you\u2019, you won\u2019t be the first. In fact, this song tells the story of a Libyan refugee child born at sea\ncalled Mercy, a story which made headlines in March last year, and the journey her mother made to give birth in a safe place.\nFrancophones might gulp at the lyric\u2018Je suis tous ces enfants que la mer a pris\u2019\u2013 I know I did. The end of the song culminates in\na chant of\u2018merci merci\u2019where Jean-Karl and \u00c9milie will try get the audience to reach out and give love to the beat.\nStorm \u2013 SuRie\nIn a post Brexit world, we really need an epic song to win Eurovision. The BBC ran their\u2018Eurovision You Decide\u2019national final\nagain \u2013 the show that gave us classics like\u2018Flying the Flag\u2019and Andrew Lloyd Webber \u2013 so hopes were high. Were these hopes\nmatched? Maybe not. But should we be ashamed of our entry this year? No way. Susanna Marie Cork, or SuRie, brings us an\nuplifting pop ballad about how storms don\u2019t last forever, and while the song isn\u2019t creating storms itself, SuRie sells it to the\ncamera and has a clever light show so we might not come last.\nNon mi avete fatto niente \u2013 Ermal Meta and Fabrizio Moro\nThis song has one of the deepest lyrics in the competition, responding to terrorist attacks around Europe over the last few\nyears.\u2018Non mi avete fatto niente\u2019means\u2018you haven\u2019t done anything to me\u2019in Italian, and is the main message of this song. Ermal\nand Fabrizio earned the right to represent Italy after winning the Sanremo Music Festival, although this win wasn\u2019t without its\ndramas. It transpires a song called \u2018Silenzio\u2019 was entered to the festival in 2016 which is extremely similar to this year\u2019s song,\nand the duo were temporarily disqualified from the festival until they were eventually allowed back in after they argued that it\nwasn\u2019t plagiarism, but self-referencing since the author of both songs were the same.\nYou Let Me Walk Alone \u2013 Michael Schulte\nThis is the first Eurovision song I\u2019ve ever cried to on first listen. Michael pulls on the heartstrings in a massive way with a\npoignant song lamenting about his life after the death of his father in his teenage years. The song has a strong Ed Sheeran feel,\nand is similarly quality. The staging of this performance just elevates this already-beautiful song \u2013 Michael stands in front of a\nscreen with images of fathers and their children as well as pictures relevant to the song being projected onto it. This song is\ngrowing in many people\u2019s estimations, and the emotional resonance it may have with many people is expected to propel it to\nperhaps Germany\u2019s best result since they won in 2010. I certainly hope this is the case.\nO Jardim \u2013 Cl\u00e1udia Pascoal and Isaura\nPortugal won the competition for the first time ever last year with the song\u2018Amar Pelos Dois\u2019, a pretty, atmospheric love song.\nThis year, they\u2019ve sent a song with a similar tone yet, for me, it\u2019s much better.\u2018O Jardim\u2019means\u2018The Garden\u2019in Portuguese and is\nabout the death of Isaura\u2019s grandmother and how she will continue to tend her garden \u2013 something which will forever remind\nher of her grandmother. It\u2019s sang by Claudia Pascoal who is best known in Portugal for coming fifth in The Voice Portugal, and\nher distinctive voice gives this song an ethereal feeling that makes it stand out above other ballads in the competition. Portugal\nmay not win again this year, but this an entry they can really be proud of.\n\n"

Cole\u2019s status as a member\nJ. Cole is often seen as a musician overshadowed by\nDrake and Kendrick Lamar, but with KOD, his latest\nstudio album, he shows why he\u2019s a vital voice in modern\nhip-hop.MusicwriterJordanBunkechartshisevolution\nas an artist, and shows why nobody can dispute Cole\u2019s\nimportance as a musician, or the relevance of his work\nin today\u2019s world.\nMUSIC\nJordan Bunke\nMusic Writer \u201cJ. Cole took\na massive\ngamble with\nhis second\nalbum,\nBorn Sinner,\nchanging the\nrelease date\nto coincide\nwith Kanye\u2019s\nYeezus\u201d\nJ\n. Cole is a singularly\nintriguing figure\nin hip-hop. Over\nthe course of his\nten-year career, one can\nobserve significant growth\nin almost every facet of\nhis psyche. Whether it is\nhis relationship with the\nlifestyle he has dreamt of\nfor so many years, or his\nmusings on his identity\nas a biracial black man in\nAmerica, Cole has been\non a journey towards\nfinding peace and contentment that can be tracked\nthrough each of his five\nstudio albums. With his\nlatest release, KOD, Cole\nhas re-emerged from his\nself-imposed exile from\npublic life, and instantly\nmade a splash only the\nlikes of Drake, Kendrick,\nor Kanye could match in\nhip-hop, all while making\nan emphatic statement on\nvices, addiction, and so-ciety. While Cole\u2019s music\nhas always included social\ncommentary \u2013 on topics\nranging from materialism\nin black America in\n\u2018Chaining Day\u2019 on his\nsophomore effort Born\nSinner to cultural appropriation on 2014 Forest\nHills Drive\u2019s \u2018Fire Squad\u2019\n\u2013 KOD feels like his\nmasterstroke. From top\nto bottom, Cole sets out\nwith the purpose to start\na discourse that promotes\nintrospection, and the\nexecution is nothing short\nof astonishing. With his\nfifth album under his belt,\nJ. Cole may have finally\nclimbed out of the shadow\nof Paula Abdul\u2019s 1988\nBillboard Hot 100 number\none smash hit \u2018Straight\nUp\u2019. It was only included\non J. Cole\u2019s debut album\nCole World: The Sideline\nStory as a bonus track, and\nCole reminisces about his\napprehension on \u2018Let Nas\nDown\u2019, citing the song as\na necessary evil because\nthe label would only give\nhim a release date with a\nradio single. The fact that\nJ. Cole recorded \u2018Let Nas\nDown\u2019 shows his integrity\nand the truth in his art, revealing a profound regret\nat recording a song that\nastronomically elevated\nhis profile and led to his\ndebut landing atop the\nBillboard 200 albums\nchart upon its release.\n\u2018Let Nas Down\u2019 was a\npivotal moment for Cole,\nas it taught him to never\ncompromise his integrity\nagain.\nJ. Cole took a massive\ngamble with his second\nalbum, Born Sinner,\nopting to change the\nrelease date to coincide\nwith Kanye West\u2019s Yeezus.\nAfter all, Kanye\u2019s status\nas a hip-hop juggernaut\nwasn\u2019t cemented until\nhe famously thrashed the\nseemingly indomitable 50\nCent in a sales battle in\n2007. Yeezus did end up\noutselling Born Sinner in\ntheir first week, but only\nby 30,000 copies \u2013 around\n10%. Cole\u2019s album\nproved to have longer\nlegs, however, edging out\nKanye for the top spot on\nthe Billboard 200 chart in\nthe third sales week. After\nthis, J. Cole gained greater\nartistic freedom. His third\nand most acclaimed album\n2014 Forest Hills Drive\nwas released in late 2014\nwithout a promotional\nsingle or any featured\nartists and went on to be\ncertified 2x Platinum by\nthe RIAA in the United\nStates, signifying two\nmillion sales. The album\nwas nominated for a Best\nRap Album Grammy\nand spawned hits like\n\u2018No Role Modelz\u2019, \u2018Wet\nDreamz\u2019, and \u2018G.O.M.D.\u2019.\nJ. Cole decided to follow\na similar route for his next\neffort, but 4 Your Eyez\nOnly failed to meet the\nlofty standards set by its\npredecessor in the eyes of\nmany fans and consumers.\nIt was around the release\nof this record that J. Cole\nquietly welcomed his first\nchild with his long-time\ngirlfriend-turned-wife.\nThe album was hardly\npromoted, apart from a\ndocumentary, and after a\nfew months spent away\nfrom his life as a world-fa-mous rapper, Cole leaned\non his die-hard fans and\nstill toured very well\ndespite his album\u2019s lack of\nimpact.\nAnd that brings us\nto KOD. Since 4 Your\nEyez Only dropped on 9th\nDecember 2016, all Cole\nhad put out is a handful of\ncarefully selected features\nfor the likes of Logic, Joey\nBada$$, Royce da 5\u20199\u2019,\nand his own Dreamville\nartist Cozz. On 16th\nApril,\nCole simply tweeted:\n\u201cNew album. KOD 4/20\u201d.\nWithin hours, the hip-hop\nsection of the Internet\npractically melted as\nspeculation began: What\ndoes KOD stand for? Why\nis Cole\u2019s Instagram icon\njust the colour purple?\nWithout a months-long\nalbum rollout, a single, or\na stunt, Cole was relevant\nagain. He released the\nalbum on 20th\nApril and\nbroke the single day\nglobal streaming record\nfor an album on Apple\nMusic, with 64.5 million\nstreams, and the single\nday US streaming record\non Spotify, with 36.6\nmillion streams in the US.\nWhile he will undoubtedly perform extremely well\ncommercially given the\nway the album came out\nof the gate, that it not why\nthis album is so important\nto Cole\u2019s status in hip-hop\nand, ultimately, to his\nlegacy.\nDrake,KendrickLamar,\nGetting deep into things // Wikimedia\nthat his two juggernaut\ncontemporaries have cast\nover him for years now.\nOne of the tracks that\nbest illustrates who J.\nCole is as a person is\n\u2018Let Nas Down\u2019, a record\nthat appeared on Born\nSinner. The track has Cole\nrecount the discovery\nthat Nas, one of his icons\nthroughout his youth\nmaking beats and writing\nraps in Fayetteville, North\nCarolina, hated Cole\u2019s\nbreakout single, \u2018Work\nOut\u2019. It is clear that Cole\nwas conflicted about\n\u2018Work Out\u2019 well before\nhe learned that he had\ndisappointed one of his\nidols. The song is a very\naccessible radio single\ngeared towards a female\naudience that has a catchy\nhook and an interpolation\nof rap\u2019s elite trifecta can no longer be disputed\n\u201cCole is an\nevocative\nstoryteller\nwhose words\npaint a vivid\nimage in the\nmind of the\nlistener\u201d\nand J. Cole are often\npegged as the three kings\nof the current generation\nof hip-hop. All of them\ncame up in the late 2000s\nand early 2010s, with\nDrake making a splash on\nthe scene first and Cole\nand Kendrick hot on his\nheels. Each have released\na classic mixtape that has\nhelped lead to the near-in-distinguishable difference\nbetween mixtapes and\nalbums today: Drake\u2019s\nSo Far Gone, Kendrick\u2019s\nSection.80, and Cole\u2019s\nFriday Night Lights.\nHowever, over time, Cole\nbecame the dark horse of\nthe trio. Kendrick\u2019s good\nkid, m.A.A.d city was a\ncritically lauded masterpiece that was celebrated\nas the triumphant return\nof west coast hip-hop.\nIt led to one of the most\ninfamous Grammy upsets\nin recent memory: when\nMacklemore and Ryan\nLewis\u2019s The Heist edged\nout G.K.M.C. for Best Rap\nAlbum. His follow-up,\nTo Pimp A Butterfly, was\nmassively ambitious,\npreaching pan-Africanism\nand filled with 2Pac and\nJesus allegories. Kendrick\ncame out of the album as a\nmessianic, near-mythical\nfigure for hip-hop whose\nreputation and status in\nthe game had exceeded\nthat of a mere mortal.\nOn the other hand,\non Spotify (until \u2018Shape\nof You\u2019 happened, that\nis). With Drake\u2019s status\nas arguably the biggest\nname in the entire music\nindustry and Kendrick\u2019s\nstatus as the saviour of\nrap, Cole appeared to be\na tier below them. He was\ncategorized as the middle\nground: possessing\nelements of Kendrick\u2019s\nconscious music without\nbeing a revolutionary;\nbeing a hitmaker like\nDrake without tailoring\nmuch of his music\ntowards a mainstream\naudience. Despite consistently releasing quality\nmusic, Cole was branded\nas the boring everyman in\nthe middle of the hip-hop\nspectrum who continuously failed to seize his\npotential and join his\ngenerational peers among\nthe pantheon of hip-hop\nlegends.\nThat is no longer the\ncase. With KOD, Cole\nhas shown us exactly why\nhip-hop needs him. The\nalbum is conceptual, but\none doesn\u2019t need multiple\ndegrees or hours spent\nporing over forums to\nfully decipher its contents\nlike a decent portion of\nKendrick\u2019s recent work.\nCole\u2019slyricsarepotent.He\nis an evocative storyteller\nwhose words paint a vivid\nimage in the mind of the\nlistener as he transports\nthem through a myriad\nof experiences with\nnigh-cinematic prowess.\nWhether it is his conversation with a damaged\nsingle mother groupie on\n\u2018Is She Gon Pop\u2019 from\nBorn Sinner, or his portrayal of a deceased father\nleaving a message for his\ndaughter on the title track\nof 4 Your Eyez Only, Cole\nhas shown time and again\nthat he is unparalleled in\nthis regard. However, this\nhas always been the case.\nWhat sets KOD apart from\nthe rest of his discography\nis the album\u2019s potential\nbeyond music. Cole\u2019s\nreleases have always been\nsubstantive, with tracks\nhighlighting or toying\nwith social issues or\naspects of human frailty.\nBefore KOD, Cole has\nnever set out to make a\ntrue concept album with\nsuch cohesion and effectiveness in its execution.\nThe theme of addiction in\nits many forms is handled\nin a manner that people\nfrom all walks of life\ncan relate to. Cole does\nnot claim to have all the\nanswers to the issues that\nhe presents, but he still\npresents some. The album\nhas already begun to\nspark conversations about\ninfidelity, materialism, al-coholism, drug abuse, the\ntax system, and a range\nof other issues. Great art\nstarts conversations, and\nJ. Cole is a great artist. For\nseveral reasons, Drake\nand Kendrick\u2019s music\nup to this point in their\nrespective careers has not\ninitiated conversations\nwith the socioeconomic\nreach and openness that\nthis album has and will\ncontinue to do. Whether\nthat is because Kendrick\nis difficult to relate to\nand not as accessible as J.\nCole, or whether Drake\u2019s\nimage makes it hard for\nhim to tackle social issues\ncan be debated, but the\nprevailing truth is that\nJ. Cole is a necessary\nstaple of the game. Drake,\nKendrick, and Cole have\nbeen fittingly described as\nthe heart, mind, and soul\nof hip-hop, respectively,\nand each of them is a\ncritical component that\ncannot be overlooked or\nunderestimated.\nThis remake of Alice in Wonderland is wack // Dreamville\n\u201cDrake,\nKendrick\nLamar, and J.\nCole are often\npegged as the\nthree kings\nof the current\ngeneration of\nhip-hop\u201d\nDrake continued to do\nwhat he did best: produce\near worm after ear worm\nand hit after hit. After his\n2015 commercial mixtape\nIf You\u2019re Reading This\nIt\u2019s Too Late, Drake had\nachieved near-global\nubiquity. His fourth album\nViews spawned \u2018One\nDance\u2019, his first Billboard\nHot 100 number 1 hit as a\nprimary artist that became\nthe most streamed song\nJ. Cole bringing the house last year // Wikimedia\n\n"

She sat down with Felix\u2019s Editor-in-Chief, Fred Fyles, to discuss her career,\ncourse, and the importance of creativity in science.\nW\nhen I enter\nG i s k i n\nD a y \u2019 s\no f f i c e ,\npast the main entrance\nof the Centre for\nLanguages, Culture, and\nCommunication, on the\nthird floor of Sherfield,\nit has been overrun with\nan array of padlocked\nbackpacks. They\u2019re being\nstored there in preparation\nof the Imperial Festival,\nwhich ran the weekend\nafter I spoke to her, and\nfor which she\u2019d helped\nstudents to design an\nescape-room-in-a-bag\nchallenge. Educational\nescape rooms, which help\ndevelop teamwork, com-munication, and lateral\nthinking, are just one example of how she brings\na sense of creativity and\nexcitement to Imperial.\nAs one of the course leads\nfor the newly-created intercalated BSc in Medical\nSciences with Humanities,\nPhilosophy, and Law,\nshe\u2019s more than qualified\nto talk about how to break\ndown the barriers between\nart and science.\nFred: Can you tell us\nabout the intercalated\nBSc you\u2019ve been running\nthis year?\nGiskin: Medical Humanities is actually not\nnew at Imperial; we\u2019ve\nrun a course for about 15\nyears, as part of a BSc. But\nthis is the first year we\u2019ve\ntaken the plunge and\noffered a full intercalated\nBSc in Humanities, Philosophy, and Law. We\u2019ve\nmerged with another\nshort course called Death,\nAutopsy, and Law and\nthe course is wonderfully\ninterdisciplinary. I think\nit differs from other types\nof intercalated BSc, in\nthat ours is bespoke for\nour students. We\u2019re not\nsending students off to \u2018sit\nin on\u2019 other courses the\nway they often do in other\nmedical schools. We\u2019ve\nreally thought about\nwhat our students like to\ndo \u2013 and what they need\nto do \u2013 and we\u2019ve themed\nthe course around that. So,\nwe\u2019ve had one module on\nthe body, one on the mind,\nand one on death and\ndying, and then students\nhave the choice to do a\nproject for which there is\nan art component.\nThroughout the course\nevery week there is a field\ntrip; we\u2019ve been to lots of\ngalleries, we\u2019ve also been\nto the law courts, we\u2019ve\nbeen to museums. We\u2019ve\nworked in partnership\nwith the Chelsea Physic\nGarden to learn about the\nhistory of pharmaceuti-cals, and we\u2019ve had a lot\nof wonderful workshops\nwith practising artists who\nare inspired by medicine\nour mantra is: you don\u2019t\nhave to be artistic to do\nthe course, it\u2019s all about\ncreativity and giving it\na go; the process is far\nmore important than the\nproduct.\nF: What do you\nthink the benefits are in\nengaging with the arts,\nparticularly in scientific\npractice? What does it\nbring?\nG: I like to use the\nanalogy of Exhibition\nRoad: it used to be a\ntraditional road with the\ntraffic going two ways\nand a small pavement,\nbut of course now there\u2019s\na huge amount of uncer-tainty. They\u2019ve removed\nthe boundary between the\npavement and the road\nand it feels like there\u2019s a\nlot happening on there,\nbicycles, coaches and\neverything \u2013 huge amount\nof ambiguity. As a result,\nyou\u2019d think it would be\ndangerous, but actually\nit makes it safer. People\nhave to communicate their\nintentions. The traffic\nslows down and drivers\nare more attentive because\nunpredictable things\nhappen. What science\noften gives the impression\nof doing is beating the\nuncertainty out of things,\nbut unless you can handle\nuncertainty, you\u2019re in\nreal trouble, especially if\nyou\u2019re going to practise\nas a doctor. The arts have\nnever that reputation: they\nhave always been ambig-uous. There\u2019s famously no\none right answer. I think\nengaging in the arts is like\nwalking down Exhibition\nRoad: you\u2019ve got to com-municate, you\u2019ve got to\nmake eye contact, you\u2019ve\ngot to make reasoned\njudgements. These are all\ngood skills in medicine.\nWhen you\u2019re working\nin real life, you rarely\nhave all the data to hand,\nthere\u2019s rarely one right\nanswer. So the BSc is a\nwonderful safe space of\nARTS\nFred Fyles\nFelix Editor\nF: And what\u2019s the\nreaction been like from\nthe students on the\ncourse?\nG: Well, naturally, the\nstudents who choose our\ncourse do tend to think\nof themselves as being\ninterdisciplinary and in-terested. But, I guess, it\u2019s\nslight different now with\nintercalated BSc, because\nwe\u2019ve got students\nwho are attracted to the\nphilosophy component,\nor the law component,\nperhaps more than the art.\nProbably a greater proportion of them feel slightly\nlike a fish out of water\nwhen it comes to art. But\nGiskin\u2019s first love was botany // Giskin Day\n\u201cThe arts give\nyou, first and\nforemost, the\nopportunity\nto learn to\nmanage\nambiguity\u201d\nand science. Students\nhave had a chance to have\na go at these various art-forms, like life drawing\nand sculpture, as well as\nlearning about the medical\ncontexts of the arts.\n\u201cI think we\ncould all do\nwith being\ncurious about\neverything,\nand not\npiegeon hole\nourselves as\n\u2018sciencey\u2019or\n\u2018arty\u2019\u201d\nexperimenting with the\nidea of there not always\nbeing one right answer\nand how you still defend\nan interpretation through\nlots of different types\nof evidence. I think it\u2019s\nhugely valuable for our\nstudents to do that.\nF: Another thing\nyou\u2019re involved with is\nthe Science Communication Horizons module.\nI think a lot of people at\nImperial maybe don\u2019t\nnecessarily see it this\nway, but no matter what\nkind of career you go\ninto, you\u2019re going to\nneed the skills to explain\nwhat you\u2019re doing, and I\nthink it is incredibly important for their careers.\nG: I couldn\u2019t agree\nmore. It\u2019s quite a tricky\nskill: when you write for\ndifferent audiences it\u2019s\nnot about dumbing down,\nit is really about pitching\nyourself and your material\nin a slightly different way.\nAnditisinvaluable.Ithink\nthose kinds of skills are\nbecoming ever more important in a digital world.\nIt\u2019s important not just to\nbe able to communicate\ntechnical information to\nothers in your field, but\nto think about different\naudiences. And today,\nwe\u2019re talking before the\nImperial Festival takes\nplace, which is a wonderful chance for scientists\nto leave the labs and the\nivory tower and engage\nwith real people who are\ninterested in their work.\nF: Do you also think\nthat humanities and arts\nstudents should study\nsome science? Can that\nhelp their practice as\nwell?\nG: I think we often\nview the arts and sciences\nas two incommensurate\nparadigms, when actually,\nthere\u2019s a lot of overlap.\nThey can both be analyti-cal, they can both be emo-tional, and they both have\nelements of subjectivity\nas well as objectivity.\nSo actually, there\u2019s not a\ngreat difference between\nthem, but just for the\npurposes of academia, we\ndo tend to divide them up.\nArtists are hugely inspired\nby science and medicine.\nGo to any art gallery and\nyou\u2019ll find works that\nhave been really inspired\nby science and the weight\nof knowledge. I think that\nwe could all do with being\ncurious about everything,\nand not pigeon hole\nourselves as \u2018sciencey\u2019\nor \u2018arty\u2019. We should be\nembracing both. They\ncomplement each other.\neffect of being part of an\ninstitution in which the\nrhetoric of excellence\nsometimes interferes with\nthe permission to experiment and permission to try\nthings out. That\u2019s what I\nthink the arts are so useful:\nyou can be experimental.\nThe Horizons programme\nallows students to expand\ntheir boundaries and their\nways of thinking. It\u2019s\na fantastic opportunity\nfor all undergraduate\nstudents to engage with\nsubjects that make them\nwell-rounded individuals.\nThey can then graduate\nwith an education rather\nthan with just a degree.\nF: Taking things back\na little, could you tell us\na little about your career\nand your journey and\nhow you ended up here\ntoday?\nG: It\u2019s slightly uncon-ventional. I think I too felt\nthe pressure to go into the\nsciences where I was more\ninclined to humanities.\nI did my first degree in\nbotany and biochemistry.\nI loved botany \u2013 I don\u2019t\nknow why I was doing bi-ochemistry! But I always\nhad a feeling that I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to be a lab scientist.\nI did want to go into\npublishing and editing,\nand I was lucky enough\nto get a job with Blackwell Science working on\nmedical journals. And\nthen I landed a dream job\nat the Science Museum,\nworking as the publications officer. I really\nenjoyed it, I loved being at\nthe museum. At the same\ntime I was doing the MSc\nhere at Imperial in Science\nCommunication and at\nthat time I was starting a\nfamily, so when Imperial\noffered me a part-time\njob teaching I jumped at\nthat. And then a few years\nin I was offered a chance\nto devise a proposal for\na medical humanities\ncourse.\nIrememberitincredibly\nclearly, as being a moment\nof being very torn. I didn\u2019t\nthink the medical school\nwould be interested in\nan arts-based BSc. I\nvery nearly just turned it\ndown straight away. But\nthen I asked a few more\nquestions and found out\nthe medical school was\ntotally on-board with\nthis, and have been very\nsupportive ever since.\nThe minute I got involved\nin medical humanities\nI realised that this was\nmy thing. My work has\nalways had some kind of\nmedical angle. When I\nwas doing botany I was\nstudying medicinal bark,\nat Blackwells I worked on\nmedical journals, and then\nwhen I was at the Science\nMuseum I was working\non the guidebooks for the\nhealth matters gallery. It\nfelt perfectly suited to my\ninterests, and I\u2019ve loved it\never since. I think Medical\nHumanities is a fantastic\ndiscipline. Writers and\nartists have such rich\nperspectives to offer to\nmedical practice -- I\u2019ve\nso enjoyed teaching it. I\nfeel very lucky to have the\nopportunity to teach in a\nsubject about which I feel\npassionate.\nF: Within your past\ncareer you\u2019ve had a lot\nof different roles. Do you\nthink having that many\ndifferent elements to\nyour past career helps\nyou today in what you\ndo?\nG: I think it definitely\ndoes. I should practise\nwhat I preach, and what\nI preach is that interdis-ciplinarity and creativity\nare wonderful. So I really\nthink my past career has\npushed me to be innovative and creative. I\u2019m not\na particularly arty person,\nbut I think my creativity\nmanifests itself in playful\nlearning activities: I like\ndesigning games to incorporate in my teaching. I\nthink if you\u2019re an engaged\npractitioner then you are\ncurious about the world\nand you try to take in\nas much as you can and\nincorporate that into\nwhat you know and what\nyou can pass on. That is\nthe fantastic thing about\nteaching is that it\u2019s also\nlifelong learning. And I\nlearn so much from the\nstudents as well. Being\na non-medic teaching\nmedics, the students have\na chance to practise their\ncommunication skills.\nThey\u2019re telling me about\nwhat they know and what\nthey think. So that\u2019s one\nof the real pleasures of the\njob: I\u2019m always learning\nfrom students.\nThe current Humanities, Philosophy and Law intercalated BSc class // Giskin Day\nF: I know I\u2019ve spoken\nto quite a few people\nwho, when I talk to\nthem about the Horizons\nprogramme they say,\n\u201cthat\u2019s not really related\nto what I\u2019m doing\u201d. Do\nyou think that kind of\ndistinction between art\nand science is what is\ncreating a barrier of\npeople getting involved?\nG: Without a doubt. I\nthink it starts very early\non in school, where if\nyou\u2019re going to do the\nscience route you\u2019re\nobliged to take a certain\nset of subjects. There is\ndefinitely this two-tier\nsystem, where it\u2019s generally thought that those\ngood at maths go into the\nsciences and those that are\nnot take the humanities,\nwhich is a great shame.\nParadoxically, by the\ntime students get to uni-versity, the arts feel too\nchallenging somehow..\nBut I think that is a side\n\n"

The main areas\nof such funding are found\nin the Departments of\nPhysics, Medicine, and\nLife Sciences. There was\nalso a general consensus\nthat the research being\ncarried out was of excellent quality.\nHowever, the report\nhighlighted there was\n\u201cgreater scope for sustainable and impactful interdisciplinary research\u201d,\nand the College should\nlook towards \u201cimplementation [of research\noutputs] where possible\non campus.\u201d\nThe report also called\nfor greater integration of\nsustainability into the cur-riculum, saying students\nat Imperial could \u201cprogress through their degree\nwithout ever having to\ncritically think about\ntheir actions on the envi-ronment, society, or the\neconomy.\u201d While there are\na number of postgraduate\nL\nondon has been\nranked the best\ncity for university students,\nbeating out Tokyo and\nMelbourne for the top\nspot.\nThis is the first year\nLondon has topped the\nrankings, which are\norganised by the higher\neducation company QS.\nLondon came third in the\nLondon rated best city for international university\nstudents\nrankings last year, being\nbeaten by Montreal and\nParis, which came first\nand second respectively.\nOnly two cities in\nthe US are in the top 30\nranking, which is dominated by universities in\nEurope, Australia, and\nAsia. This is a sharp\ncontrast to the QS World\nUniversity Rankings, in\nwhich American institutions occupy around 50%\nof the top rankings.\nThe annual report,\nwhich \u201cshowcases the\nbest urban destinations for\ninternational students\u201d,\nuses a range of indicators\nto generate their rankings,\nranging from the number\nof ranked higher education institutions in the\ncity, through to pollution\nlevels and the number of\ngraduates who stay on\nafter they finish in higher\neducation.\nWhile London scores\nhighly on Student Mix,\nStudent View, and\nEmployer Activity, it is\namong the least affordable\ncities for students. A high\ncost of living and increasing rents make London a\ncomparatively expensive\ncity for students. The\naverage rent for students\nat Imperial-owned properties stands at \u00a3175/week,\nand private halls aimed\nat students can cost up to\n\u00a3430/week.\nWhile QS said \u201crent\nand living costs are significantly higher in London\u201d,\ntheysaiditcouldbe\u201cworth\nevery penny\u201d due to the\neducational, cultural, and\nsocial opportunities. They\ndescribed the city as a\n\u201cnerve-centre of global\nacademia,\u201d citing UCL\nand Imperial, which rank\nseventh and eighth respectively in the QS World\nUniversity Rankings. In\ntotal, 17 universities in\nLondon appear in the QS\nuniversity rankings.\nThe QS rankings are\ndesigned for international\nstudents, looking at\nmoving to London for\nuniversity. According to\nthe Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA),\n19% of students studying\nin this country are from\noutside the UK \u2013 nearly\n450,000 as of last year.\nThe most prevalent international non-EU group\nare Chinese students, who\nmake up almost one third\nof non-EU students.\ncourses centred around\nsustainability, the exposure undergraduate students have to such content\ncan be limited; last\nyear\u2019s Global Challenge\nHorizons module \u2013 an\noptional module available\nto undergraduate students\n\u2013 was cancelled due to\nlack of demand.\nDivestment\nOne area the report\nhighlighted was Imperial\u2019s investments in fossil\nfuels.Around half of those\nasked about what initiatives the College should\nsupport said the university\nshould go Fossil Free,\nwith over 40 raising the\nissue in further comments.\nThe report highlighted\nthe work that had been\ndone by the student pressure group Divest Imperial, who met with Imperial\nsenior management earlier\nthis year. The report said\nthe College \u201cdoesn\u2019t think\nit\u2019s immoral to receive\nfunds\u201d from fossil fuel\ncompanies, and believed\ninvestment in fossil fuels\nwas good for the environ-ment.\nThe Greening Imperial\nreport recommends the\nCollege investigate how\nthe endowment fund can\nbe invested in businesses\nthat are environmentally\nsustainable. Professor Jo\nHaigh, Co-Director of\nthe Grantham Institute\nand Greening Imperial\nco-author, told: \u201cAs a\nfirst step we would like\nto see college introduce\na Responsible Investment\nPolicy in order to assess\nthe environmental and\nethical credentials of\nits current and future\ninvestments. We hope that\nGreening Imperial will\nparticipate in and inform\nthe divestment debate\nto help Imperial take a\nleadership position on this\ntopic.\u201d\nEarlier this academic\nyear, an investigation from\nFelix found Imperial had\nnearly \u00a39 million invested\nin fossil fuel companies\nthrough their endowment fund. The College\nalso had \u00a33.5 million\ninvested in tobacco and\n\u00a33.1 million invested in\nthe arms industry. In the\nPeople and Planet league\ntables, the College had a\nrating of zero for ethical\ninvestment.\nOver the past couple of\nyears, the number of universities divesting from\nfossil fuels has risen dra-matically. It now stands\nat over sixty institutions,\nincluding King\u2019s College\nLondon, Edinburgh, and\nthe University of St.\nAndrews.\nNext Steps\nThe scoping study\npresented to the Provost\u2019s\nBoard was met with an\n\u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d response, according\nto Professor Maitland, but\nthe report \u201cstill needs to\nbe approved as part of the\nplanning round process\nover the summer.\u201d\nA representative of\nImperial College Union\nsaid they welcomed the\nreport, and told Felix:\n\"With the backing of the\nProvost\u2019s Board and the\ninvolvement of the past\ntwo Deputy Presidents\n(Finance & Services),\nRachel Blythe and\nMatthew Blackett, as\nco-authors, we are confident that this report will\nlead to the change which\nour members would like\nto see at Imperial.

It is\nhighly likely that you\nare feeling anxious, and\nliving off energy drinks\nin the library \u2013 or perhaps\nyou are one of the post-docs that survived exams\nsince you have the time\nto read this! Nevertheless,\nthis article still concerns\nyou: maybe it is someone\nyou know, maybe you are\nthe one who is suffering.\nEspecially during this\nstressful period, it is\nimportant to learn about\nvarious types of mental\nillness, and what you can\ndo to help.\nFor some mental\nillnesses,medicationsmay\nnot necessarily benefit the\nentire population. Additionally, defining what\nconstitutes a disorder, or\ndistinguishing health from\nillness, can be difficult\nfor psychiatric condi-tions, since there are no\nbiomarkers such as blood\nsugar level for diabetes.\nTherefore, a better diagnostic and screening tool\nis desperately needed.\nLuckily, a simple test was\nrecently revealed to be\nuseful in predicting future\noutcomes.\nThis simple Self-Rated\nMental Health (SRMH)\ntest allows patients to rate\ntheir mental condition\nfrom \u2018Excellent\u2019to \u2018Poor\u2019.\nIn an article recently\npublished in the Journal\nof Health and Social Behaviour, a research group\nshowed SRMH to be a\nbetter predictor of future\nmental health status.\nThe advantage of\nSRMH is that the assessment is influenced by\nboth social and cultural\nfactors, as well as unobserved qualities of\nobjective health, such as\nseverity, the persistence\nof symptoms, and functional limitations (e.g.\ninsomnia). SRMH can\nalso take life events into\naccount, including sepa-rations, examinations, and\nunemployment \u2013 aspects\nundetected using clinical\nobjective measurements.\nSome scientists have\nconcerns about the effectiveness of this method,\nas previous studies found\n64% of the individuals\nreported their mental\nhealth as \u2018good\u2019, despite\nbeing diagnosed for a\nmental health condition.\nOne potential explanation\nof such a phenomenon\nmay be that patients are\nafraid of the judgement\nthey can receive following\na mental health diagnosis.\nSome may feel that poor\nmental health may be seen\nas weakness, thus they do\nnot acknowledge the existence of such problems.\nTo ensure these effects\nare removed, researchers\nstudied patients who were\ndiagnosed with mental\nillness and followed them\nfor a year. If patients\nare less likely to seek\ntreatment due to social\nstigma, researchers should\nobserve an unchanged or\ndeterioration of mental\nhealth in these \u2018health\noptimists\u2019.\nSurprisingly, the\nopposite was observed.\n30% of the optimists do\nbetter than their pessimistic counterpart \u2013 with or\nwithout treatment \u2013 after\none year of follow up.\nThese \u2018health optimists\u2019\nwere more likely to\nbe Latino or African\nAmerica, and less likely\nto be white or Caucasian. Marital status also\naffected how people rated\nthemselves \u2013 married\nrespondents generally\nhave a better score than\ndivorced patients. Furthermore, people with a\nhigher level of education\nand better socioeconomic\nbackground tend to have a\nbetter self-rated score.\nWhile it is unclear\nwhy these factors affect\nSRMH, but one thing is\nfor sure: the usefulness of\nsuch a holistic approach\nto mental health evaluation can improve current\nmental health care. In\nfuture, SRMH can be implemented in the clinic by\nasking patients how they\nfeel about themselves.\nThis can help to identify\nindividuals who may\nbenefit most from treat-ment, and enable tailored\ntreatment for them.\nTo conclude, SRMH is\nultimately based on how\na person feels. We must\nunderstand that a mental\nillness is a disease of both\nthe mind and the body.\nAsking one to \u2018snap out of\nit\u2019 is as helpful as asking\na person with a fractured\nleg to sprint. Those with\na better SRMH may\nhave a better sense of the\nmeaning of life, or they\nare better at coping with\ntheir symptoms. Whatever\nthe reason may be,\nsupport from family and\nfriends is still one of the\nmost important aspects\nof recovery for mental\nillness. Even if you are\nnot convinced by the\neffectiveness of SRMH\ntests, showing you care\nabout people around you\ncan never be a bad thing!\nEU moves to ban neonicotinoids\nO\nn Friday 27th\nApril, member\nstates of the\nEU moved to\nsupport the ban of outdoor\nagricultural uses of three\nimportant neonicotinoid\npesticides, due to concerns\nsurrounding their harmful\neffects on bees and other\npollinators. This decision\nfollowed the European\nFood Safety Authority\u2019s\n(EFSA) publication in\nFebruary of a set of key\nreports that concluded\nthese pesticides presented\nan unacceptable risk\nto wild and honeybee\npopulations.\nNeonicotinoids, or\nneonics, encompass a\nfamily of pesticides that\nwere developed in the\n1980s to be highly effective against insect pests,\nbut harmless to other\nspecies, targeting unique\nelements of an insect\u2019s\nnervous system. The three\nneonicotinoids affected\nby the new ban \u2013 imida-cloprid, thiamethoxam\nand clothiandin \u2013 account\nfor almost all of the neon-icotinoid pesticides used\nin the UK. In 2016, all\nthree were restricted from\nuse on crops especially\nattractive to bees in 2013\n\u2013 a decision that prompted\nlegal action by Bayer and\nSyngenta, two leading\nglobal manufacturers of\nneonics. However, April\u2019s\ndecision represents one of\nthe most comprehensive\nand wide-ranging controls\non the use of these pesti-cides.\nInterest in the effects\nof neonicotinoids on\npollinators, especially\nbees, developed in the\nmid-2000s and has more\nrecently become the\nsubject of a great deal\nof public attention and\ndebate. One highly publicised study from 2017\nfound that honey sampled\nfrom around the world\ncontained a cocktail of\nneonicotinoids. A second\nstudy examined neonic\neffects across Hungary,\nthe UK, and Germany,\nand reported that bees\nwere less able to survive\nand produce new colonies\nwhen exposed to the\npesticides at field-realistic\ndoses. Despite mounting\nevidence of the harmful\neffects of neonics, the UK\ngovernment remained in\nsupport of their use until\nthe Secretary of State for\nthe Environment, Michael\nGove MP, also announced\nin late 2017 the intention\nof the UK government to\nback the proposed ban.\nBayer and Syngenta\ncriticised the ban, describing it in their press\nreleases as \u201ca sad day for\nfarmers\u201d and \u201c[taking]\nEuropean farming in the\nwrong direction.\u201d They\nstated that current scientific evidence indicated\nthat neonics are far less\nharmful to bee populations\nthan other hazards such\nas the climate or disease,\nand criticised the EFSA\nreport as \u201cover-conservative.\u201d The UK\u2019s National\nFarmers Union made a\nsimilar statement, calling\non the British government\nto work to mitigate the\nimpacts of the ban to\navoid damage to the UK\nfarming industry.\nCritics of the ban have\nalso drawn attention to a\nrange of potential challenges posed by the ban\n\u2013 from the obvious potential for impacts on crop\nyields, to suggestions that\nthe loss of the relatively\nselective neonicotinoids\nwill force farmers to resort\nto older, less discriminate\npesticides. Syngenta have\nfurther criticised the\ndecision as being based\non unapproved guidance\nmaterial, while Bayer suggested their ongoing legal\naction against the EU\u2019s\n2013 partial ban should\nhave forestalled further\naction.\nHowever, environmental groups have lauded\nthe ban, with Buglife\n(The Invertebrate Conservation Trust) calling it\na \u201cred letter day for the\ncontinent\u2019s pollinators.\u201d\nHowever, they also noted\nthat neonic residues\nin the earth and water\nmay continue to harm\npollinators for years to\ncome, due in part to the\nuse of neonics in pet flea\ntreatments, which are not\ncovered by the ban!\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nSam S Welch\nScience Writer\nTake time out to look after yourself // CC\n\n"

In a\nstatement for Hangman,\nthe plaintiffs said: \u201cthe\nclosure of the QTR Restaurant was frustrating,\nbut understandable.\nHowever, the College then\ndecided to open up the\nSenior Common Room\nup to undergraduates.\nThis is a clear violation\nof the College\u2019s own Safe\nSpace Policy, and leaves\nacademics without a space\nto escape students harassing them about feedback\nor past papers.\u201d\nOne staff member, who\nspoke to Hangman on the\ncondition of anonymity,\nsaid: \u201cthe SCR was my\nonly real respite from\nspending time with under-graduates.

I had\nheard a lot about what to\nanticipate: a deprecation\nof any subject which is\nnot \u2018hard-core science\u2019,\nconfrontation because\nsomeone enjoys taking\npart in activities different\nto the \u2018status quo\u2019, and\nconstant mockery of\nmedical students taking a\n\u2018year off\u2019 if they decided\nto intercalate in a non-sci-entific subject. I was\npreparing for a struggle\nwith having to tell people\nwhat I chose to study for\nmy intercalated degree:\na BSc in Humanities,\nPhilosophy and Law.\nI am a medical student\nnormally studying at\nthe University of Edinburgh, but I wanted to\ntake a year away from\nMedical Sciences and\ndelve into the culture\nsurrounding medicine\n\u2013my choice of degree\nwas perfect. Studying\nat Imperial seemed a\nfantastic experience, but\nit has brought another\ninteresting element to my\nintercalated year: being at\na predominantly science\nuniversity. The contrast\nbetween Imperial and\nEdinburgh is massive: Edinburgh has students from\nall different disciplines,\nand \u2013 because the city is\na lot smaller \u2013 it is easy\nfor students to mix. Most\nof my friends in Scotland\ndo not study medicine, let\nalone any of the sciences.\nThis leads to a mutual understanding of all subjects\nand an exposure to several\ndifferent disciplines\nregardless of what you\nstudy. This is not what\nI have experienced at\nImperial\u2013 people tend to\nstick within their cohort,\nand lack the influence of\nart students. Perhaps this\nis why I have observed a\nlot less acceptance of the\narts by the student body.\nhumans\u2019 well-being.\nThis is especially salient\nin today\u2019s pressurised\nsociety, in which mental\nhealth issues are ubiqui-tous.\nAlthough the conference was about the\nbenefits art has to health,\nother scientific disciplines\nhave a lot to gain too.\nSculpture, for example,\ncan allow people to\nimprove dexterity and\nsee objects from different\nperspectives. These are\ncritical skills for engineers\nand medics. Scientific\nresearch can also benefit\nfrom the creativity art can\nbring: when research is\nexplored through different\nparadigms, scientists\napproach problems in\nnovel ways, which can\nbring superior results.\nFurthermore, several\nartistic activities \u2013 such\nas exploring paintings,\nreading literature\u2026 the\nlist is endless \u2013 help scientists understand ideas\ndifferent to their own.\nIn a world where those\nwho study science will\nbe working with people\nfrom all different disci-plines, this is critically\nimportant. Science profits\nfrom the openness the\narts can bring, but there\nare still people who don\u2019t\nthink this, especially at\nImperial.\nI\u2019m not writing this\narticle to say Imperial\ndoesn\u2019t encompass the\narts. In fact, I would say\nthe opposite: I was overwhelmed by the number\nof ways to get involved in\nthe arts , and I have seen\nhow the Imperial management and staff are very\nsupportive of students\ngetting exposure to the\nartistic world. There are\nseveral ways to engage :\nfrom the societies and art\ngroups available to join,\nto the Imperial Horizons\nprogramme which offer\nmore opportunities to\nembrace the artistic world\nthan I thought possible.\nEven the fact that I am\nstudying a degree in\nHumanities, Philosophy,\nand Law is a fantastic\nexample of how Imperial\nhas embraced the arts.\nHowever, why do\nstudies, but some students\nare still not embracing\nthis. What needs to happen\nat the College is even\nfurther integration of the\narts into sciences: perhaps\nImperial Horizons should\nbecome a requisite for\nevery degree and not just\na select few? Or there\nshould be more mixing\nbetween Imperial students\nand those from other uni-versities? Through means\nof therapy, creativity, and\ndifferent ideas the arts\nbring, they are beneficial\nto our whole society.\nInstitutions like Imperial\nshould do all they can to\nensure engage with the\narts as well as their scientific study. Maybe, if this\nhappens, the arts will stop\ngetting criticism they can\nso undeservedly receive.\nAesop\u2019s Arts in Health Conference shows how science and art can work together// Tas Kyprianou\n\u201cThe arts\nprovide\nscientists and\nengineers\nwith the\ntoolkit to work\nin a multidisciplinary\nenvironment \u201d\nsome students decide\nnot to engage with the\narts? Is it the pressure of\nworkload, or the social acceptance of taking part in\nextra-curricular activities?\nOr is it that the arts are not\nactually as accessible as I\nthink? My opinion of the\narts at Imperial is biased\n\u2013 I am doing the first arts-based course offered at\nImperial, and thus I have\ngreater exposure to what\nis offered. I am certain\nthat my impression of\nImperial is skewed: the\nfriendships and networks\nI have formed are based\nin a shared appreciation\nof the arts, mostly from\nmy intercalated degree.\nIt would be interesting to\nhear the views of students\non other courses.\nImperial is welcoming\nthe arts to its scientific\nAs a firm believer of\nhow the arts can benefit\nhealth, I attended Aesop\u2019s\nSecond Arts in Health\nConference & Showcase\nlast month. It was a\nfantastic day filled with\nimportant conversations,\nworkshops, and impressive presentations by\nartistic groups working\nto benefit the health of\nothers. The stand out\npresentations were those\nwhich implemented dance\ntherapies, drama thera-pies, and music therapies\nto improve health. The\nmessage that resonated\nthroughout the day was\nsimple: the arts benefit\n\n"
