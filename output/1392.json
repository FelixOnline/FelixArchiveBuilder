Somewhat surprisingly, this isn\u2019t\njust a case of marketing tactics, Charlie succeeds where the others fall by\npointing out the ridiculous decisions\nmade by Governments during war.\nThis isn\u2019t a criticism of Government\npolicy, but the story of fun loving Texan congressman, Wilson (Hanks), who,\nafter some influencing from a wealthy\nsocialite (Roberts), tries to raise support from the US covert war to get the\nSoviets out of Afghanistan during the\nlast years of the Cold War. Inspired\nby a new story (\u201cBased\u201d seems to have\ngone out of fashion in films), the fast\ntalking Wilson is the perfect antithesis\nto the straight laced, po-faced politicians of reality and an interesting central viewpoint.\nThe other side of war shows a witty screenplay can spark up two of Hollywood\u2019s fastest dimming stars\nHanks plays him to satisfactory effect but at no point do you feel that\nit was incredibly taxing for him. The\nwitty script makes a likeable character\nout of what could have been simply a\nhard drinking, womanising misogy-nist. How many films these days would\ndraw a laugh rather than a scowl when\nthe main character hires an office full\nof beautiful women and refers to them\nas \u2018jailbait\u2019?\nJulia Roberts has fallen into the same\ncategory as Brad Pitt in that she is so\nblatantly Julia Roberts and not whoever is required in the role. She has a\nbigger problem in that she could never\nact as well as Pitt either, but thankfully\nshe has conceded to take a supporting role here and her grating Texan\ndrawl is kept to a minimum. Philip\nSeymour Hoffman continues to dominate character acting in Hollywood as\na bad-tempered CIA agent, equipping\nhimself with his usual masterly skill, although he doesn\u2019t reach the heights of\nsome of his other roles. Still, his character adds a nice angle that could have\neasily been overlooked if a more commanding central star had been cast.\nThe script is the best feature Charlie\nhas to offer, and studios would do well\nto pay heed to this comic, yet sensitive,\nportrayal of war. If it goes to show any-thing, it\u2019s that there\u2019s more to say about\nissues when you strip away the tears.\nSave those for the Best Actress winner.\nAlex Casey\nCharlie Wilson\u2019s War \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Mike Nichols\nWriter: Aaron Sorkin\nCast: Tom Hanks,\nJulia Roberts,\nPhilip Seymour\nHoffman\nWhat does the scheme entail?\n\u0090 Undergraduates/Postgraduates undertaking a 3 week placement in June/July\nin a school/college\n\u0090 Working alongside experienced teachers and assisting in classroom teaching\n\u0090 Groups of up to 10 students can be placed in one school\n\u0090 Placements arranged by Exscitec\nWhat are the benefits of the scheme?\n9 Receive a \u00a3600 tax free bursary for completing the 15 day placement\n9 Receive a free CRB Disclosure check\n9 Have something different for your CV\n9 Develop new transferable skills and communication experience\n9 Gain first hand experience of what a career in teaching involves\nSupport secondary school Maths, Physics or Chemistry in London\nPre-requisites : A- Levels in Maths, Physics or Chemistry\nFor more information or to apply contact Sarah Cooper:\nsarah.cooper@exscitec.com\n01730 235683\nDeadline for applications : 31 January 2008\nLinks : www.tda.gov.uk / www.imperial.ac.uk/outreach / www.exscitec.com\nS\nSt\ntu\nud\nde\nen\nnt\nt A\nAs\nss\nso\noc\nci\nia\nat\nte\nes\ns S\nSc\nch\nhe\nem\nme\ne (\n(S\nSA\nAS\nS)\n)\n\n"

Participants were awarded a\npoint for each of these behaviours: not\nsmoking, not being physically inactive,\nhaving a moderate alcohol intake and\nhaving a blood vitamin C level consistent with eating five servings of fruit\nand vegetables a day.\nThe study is among the first to examine the combined impact of these behaviours on longevity. After an 11-year\nfollow-up, the relative risk (compared\nto those scoring 4) for all-cause mortality for subjects scoring 3, 2, 1 and 0\nwas 1.39, 1.95, 2.52 and 4.04, respec-tively. To put it plainly, a person adopting none of the above behaviours was\n4 times more likely to die during the\nstudy period than a person adopting\nthem all.\nSmoking, predictably, had the biggest\nsingle impact on mortality, followed by\na low vitamin C intake, high alcohol intake and physical inactivity.\nWho wants to live forever anyway?\nComing from a long line of nonagenar-ians, I gather it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up\nto be.

Ever eat yoghurt afterwards and notice the pain begin to\nwane or subside entirely? While it\nmay seem like a simple by-product\nof milk, eating a pot of yoghurt\nactually introduces nearly a billion probiotic bacteria into\nyour body.\nAlthough these \u2018friendly bacteria\u2019 have been\nknown to aid digestion\nand can even be taken\nin supplement form,\nexactly how these\nprobiotics work in the\ngut has been relatively\nunclear until recently.\nHowever, progress\nis being made,\nand a new study\non probiotics\nfrom researchers at Imperial\nCollege and\nNestl\u00e9 Research Center in Switzerland\ncertainly\nhelps, as\nit provides\nfurther\nevidence of\nhow probiotics\ncould lead to new health\ntherapies.\nThe study investigated how probiotics change the biochemistry of adverse\nkinds of gut microbes which have been\nconnected to various medical condi-tions, such as certain kinds of diabetes\nand obesity. Harmful bacteria in the\ngut degrade proteins, releasing metabolites (chemical by-prod-ucts of cellular\nprocesses)\nincluding\nammonia,\namines\nand in-doles, all\nof which\nare toxic\nto humans\nin high\nconcen-trations.\nProbiotic\nbacteria\nactually\nhelp balance\nthe body\u2019s gut\nflora by reducing\nharmful bacteria\nthat cause debilitating disease.\nFor the study\ntwo probiotic\ndrinks were given\nto mice with transplanted human gut\nmicrobes.Research-ers then measured\nmetabolites taken\nfrom the liver, blood,\nurine and faeces of\nthe mice who received\nprobiotics and a control\ngroup that did not. Interestingly, the mice treated with probiotics\nScientists discover the formula for a long life\ning almost entirely of frankfurters and\nsauerkraut, found her own longevity a\nconstant source of irritation.\nWhat really matters is the quality of\nlife, or functional health, of our ageing\npopulation. This study should be extended to explore the effect of the combined health behaviours on the quality\nof life as well as the risk of death. Nevertheless, with already overwhelming\nevidence that the above lifestyle choices influence well-being, and boosted\nby the findings from this study, public\nhealth officials should, theoretically,\nfind it easier to encourage behaviour\nchanges likely to improve the health of\nmiddle-aged and older people.\nPublication of the study coincided\nwith Gordon Brown\u2019s unveiling of his\n\u2018NHS of the future\u2019. In his plans for a\npreventative approach to healthcare,\nMr. Brown said that there would be a\nfocus on patients whose lifestyle choices \u2013 including smoking, drinking and\nobesity \u2013 made them unwell. There\nwould be changes to food labelling,\ngreater access to sport and exercise\nand new restrictions on advertising\nunhealthy foods. This approach is intended to help the NHS cope with the\nchallenges of an older and potentially\nless healthy population.\nIn the proposed NHS constitution,\nwhich would set out the rights and\nresponsibilities linked to entitlement\nto care, smokers may find themselves\nhaving to quit in order to maintain\ntheir rights to healthcare. Surely it is\nonly a matter of time until the over-in-dulgent and idle among us come under\nfire.

Professor Jeremy Nicholson,\ncorresponding author of the study at\nImperial College Department of Biomolecular Medicine, says that probiotics affects metabolism in unique and\ncomplex ways. \"Our study shows that\nprobiotics can have an effect and they\ninteract with the local ecology and talk\nto other bacteria. We're still trying to\nunderstand what the changes they\nbring about might mean, in terms of\noverall health, but we have established\nthat introducing 'friendly' bacteria can\nchange the dynamics of the whole population of microbes in the gut.\"\nIn light of the growing scientific and\nsocial concern for obesity, probiotics could also influence how fat is absorbed by the body. Mice treated with\nprobiotics showed changes in how\nthey metabolised bile acids, produced\nby the liver to break down fats in the\nupper gut.\nIn the future, probiotic therapies\ncould assist individuals in overcoming obesity, therapies which have been\ncustomised to the patient\u2019s specific\nmetabolism. And that\u2019s not all - similar studies have also revealed that the\nsynergetic role of probiotics in the gut\nmeans they show potential for treating\na wide range of health ailments from\ncardiovascular disease to gastrointestinal cancer.\nTissue from a mouse intestine.

Since\nthen, Union President Stephen Brown\nand Deputy President (Education &\nWelfare) Kirsty Patterson have been\npreparing a survey for students that\nwill be launched on the 25th January at\nlunchtime.\nThe survey aims to gauge opinion on\nhigher education funding as a whole\nrather than current government policy\nspecifically. Felix has obtained an early\ndraft of the questionnaire and its structure asks general questions about the\nrole of higher education before getting onto questions of funding. This\nwill help direct Union policy on higher\neducation funding.\nWith constant discussion over top-up fees and the effect it will have on\nthe higher education sector, the Union believes that their current policy is\n\u201cunrealistic\u201d. So how did funding end\nup at the current situation?\nIn July 1997, the Dearing Report on\nhigher education assessed that free\neducation was not viable and suggested a contribution from the student\nof \u00a31,000 instead. At the time of the\nreport, tuition was free and students\nhad access to equal grants and loans.\nThis \u00a31,000 would be paid after gradu-ation, i.e: a graduate tax. However, the\ngovernment did not introduce the recommendations of the Dearing Report,\ninstead favouring a loan system and\ncharging \u00a31,000 in tuition fees. This\nsystem was amended for the academic\nyear 2006/7 introducing the infamous\ntop-up fees.\nThe introduction of top-up fees\n(capped at \u00a33,000) has not been seen\nas an adequate solution by some. The\nRector, Sir Richard Sykes, has been\nan advocate of higher top-up fees in\nthe past alongside greater bursaries.\nAmongst all this debate, in 2009 the\ncap on the top-up fees will be reviewed\nby a government board. By the time\nthe report has drawn its conclusions,\nthe Union is hoping to have a policy\nwith which to stand by.\nIn the next couple of weeks, Felix and\nthe Union are encouraging debate over\nthe current funding model, proposals\nof new models and a detailed explanation of how we got to where we are.\nThis will all lead up to the aforementioned survey going live on the day that\nFelix is out.\nThe following debates and the survey will deal with issues such as the\npurpose of education, whether it be a\nmeans for employment or it existing\nfor its own sake; also, larger political\nissues such as social mobility will be\nopened up for even greater discussion.\nStudent involvement is necessary to\npresent a clear and cohesive policy, so\nget involved next Friday and have your\nsay in the funding debate.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s at stake in the Higher Education Funding debate\nWhy do we need a Higher\nEducation Funding debate?\nKirsty Patterson\nImperial College Union Deputy\nPresident (Education & Welfare)\nSpending a fair majority of time over\nthe last three years dabbling in Student\npolitics it hasn\u2019t been a particularly dubious task to deduce one thing about\nstudents in general: there is nothing in\ngeneral that unifies students on political issues. Representing the views of a\n\u2018movement\u2019 of students can at times\nbe exactly as changeable as it sounds.\nWith such a dynamic political agenda\nfrom year to year a debate involving the\nNUS and the Government would draw\nclose parallels to a trolley race where\nwe are pitting four broken wheels going in different directions against jet\npropulsion. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be\nputting money on the broken trolley.\nThe next big trolley race is peeking\nover the horizon. After the introduction of top-up fees in October 2006\na review of the \u00a33000 cap is due in\n2009. By my estimate that gives us just\nenough time to fix the broken trolley\nwheels and decide which way they are\ngoing to be pointing.\nIn the second meeting of Union\nCouncil in the 2006/2007 period a\npolicy was passed which outlined the\nImperial College Union stance on Tuition Fees. It was passed at a Council\nbefore any Ordinary Members had\nbeen elected which is not the most\ndemocratic of bodies.\nSincethepolicywaswrittenanumber\nof key positions in the Higher Education debate have shifted. The NUS is no\nlonger running a campaign to fight for\nfree education for all, instead choosing\nto concentrate on keeping the cap in\nplace; the Rector of Imperial College\nLondon has changed his stance on unregulated fees instead favouring raising the cap by a much smaller amount\nthan he originally stated; and that ten\nyears on from the Dearing Report the\nmeasures put in place to address the\ndying Higher Education system have\nnot had the predicted effect of restricting access for students from poor so-cio-economic backgrounds.\nThe need for a full debate on Higher\nEducation funding stems from these\npolitical shifts and the availability of\nmore information than we had a year\nago. With key debates in the NUS occurring in the near future and the\ndeadline for amendments to NUS Conference at the end of February, Council\ndecided that a full review of our current policy should take place.\nThe survey will be open to all students of Imperial College to allow the\nstudent population as a whole to get\ninvolved rather than a few student\nmembers of Council. Also, the questions will be supported by all the available facts on funding, bursaries and\npossible solutions printed in Felix over\nthe coming weeks to help you come to\nan informed decision.\nOnce we have gathered your opinions\nall that is left to do is align the trolley\nwheels in the right direction and start\nthe mad dash to the finish line.\nThe survey is open to all IC students, not just Union Councillors\n\n"

I cannot help\nbut think how many insecure\nteenagers have been made a\nlittle bit more insecure as they\nlog on for a quick online shop.\nCOOL\nLAME\nM\nini Skirts and\nme? Not a\nchance.\nWith\nspring\nupon us comes the hike\nof hemlines. But not me;\nI\u2019m sticking to decency,\nthank you. Designers are\nall putting skirts the size of\nhandkerchiefs on mannequins in their windows and\nwomen are flocking to stores,\nclawing for a kitchen-towel\nsized wrap-around. It\u2019s all\nright for those who have legs\nup to their chests, tanned,\ntoned and perfectly waxed.\nBut what about the average woman? With shorter\nhemlines come a myriad of\nproblems that the designers don\u2019t seem to think affect us. Firstly, having to wear\nshorter skirts means having to\nshow off your legs. Fair enough\nthat designers have given us\nenough warning, there still\nis time to get into shape before spring is actually upon us,\nbut isn\u2019t that another task to\nadd onto our already long list?\nAnd what about those of us who were\nborn with fat, unshapely legs, and just\ncan\u2019t do anything about them? With\nshorter skirts come psychological issues that women\nhave to battle. Swallowing\ntheir pride and abandoning all sense of rationality,\nmany still choose to wear\nmicro-minis, with the disastrous result of stopping\ntraffic; for all the wrong\nreasons.\nBesides the eyesores\nthat these offending pieces of material sometimes create,\nmany women are also\nputting themselves\nat risk by being dedicated followers of this\nparticularly disreputable fashion. Shorter\nskirts invite a cacophony of catcalls and wolf\nwhistles as a woman\nwalks down the street for\nher morning coffee, and\nin extreme situations this\ncould lead to sexual harassment and other situations\ninvolving testoster-one-charged males.\nAlthough you may\nside with Eve Ensler (author\nof the immortal \u2018The Vagina Monologues\u2019) when she says, \"my short skirt\nis not an invitation, provocation, or in-were inundated with\ndifferent styles of\nChucks; suede,\nleather, vinyl,\nlow-top and\nhigh-top,\nand eventually it caught\non in a big\nway. This fad\nwas one that\nwould never\nreally die out.\nThe All Star\nbrand, largely synonymous with bas-ketball, made an eventual\namazing shift towards the music sub-culture.Duringthe1970s,theRamones\nepitomized the popularity of Chucks in\nAmerica by using scruffy plain black\nhi-top Chucks as part of their trademark image. Across the pond, the Sex\nPistols flew the flag for Chucks, albeit\nwith less popularity amongst fans. Oldschool trends owe a lot to All Star\u2019s\nperseverant resurges into the mainstream casual footwear market. During the late Eighties and early Nineties,\nthe grunge scene allowed Chucks to\nonce again climb the scales of subculture fashion. Nirvana, yet\nanother truly iconic\nband, featured\nAll Stars in\nmany of\ntheir photo\nshoots.\nToday,\nin 2008,\nthe world\u2019s\nbeloved Chucks are now officially products of Nike,\nafter the 2001 takeover\nof Converse. Bankruptcy forced Converse to sell over, and\nin some eyes \u2018out\u2019, to\nthe major sportswear conglomerate.\nStill marketed under the classic Converse brand, a distinct\nsour taste has been\nleft in the more ethical\nof mouths. Nike\u2019s associations with child labour in Asia\nhave now bled over to the Converse\nbrand, to the displeasure of treasurers\nof Converse\u2019s previous history and val-ues. Despite this, sales of Chucks are\nsuccessful as ever, with an extended\nrange of prints, materials, cuts and\ncustomizable options available to today\u2019s ever-demanding consumer. Gone\nare Chucks\u2019 heady days of punk rock\nand grunge; they now belong in the\nmainstream of global fashion and cul-ture. Hollywood films such as I, Robot\nand Sin City continue to provide mass\nexposure through heavy (if not annoyingly blatant) product-placement.\nEvery new year All Stars are on the\nout, according to fashion experts, but\nit\u2019s like saying you\u2019ll get bored of your\nfavourite film. You never will, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be your favourite film.\nAll Stars are simply the Pulp Fictions,\nand the Shawshank Redemptions of\nfashion.

What\nI\u2019m trying to say is\nthat women have a\nresponsibility for the\nsignals they send to\nmen. The Home Office suggests that in\nthe past year, a total of\nthe various reported\noffences of rape\nwas 13,322. Come\nhopefully warmer\nweather, are these\nnumbers going to rise? If they do, are\nwe to blame?\nDon\u2019t shorter skirts represent a more\nbuoyant economy?

And if skirts\nare long, the markets are\nheading down. Hmm\u2026I\ndon\u2019t think so. The idea\nbehind this is that shorter\nskirts tend to appear in times\nwhen consumer confidence is\nhigh, meaning the markets are\nbullish. In contrast, long skirts are\nworn more in times of depression,\nindicating that things are bearish.\nTo the modern, rational reader\nI ask incredulously, do you actually believe this? If so, why not\nwear no skirt at all; surely that\nwould mean our economy is\nbooming. I shake my head in\ndisbelief, and before I am accused of masquerading as a\nmisogynist, I say this: pussy\npelmets should by no means\nbe a substitute for logical\nthinking.\nWith a lot more than\nmeets the eye (irony in-tended), short skirts have\na ubiquitous and far-reaching effect, even if\nthe furthest down they\nreach is your bum. This\nwriter intends to be\nfash- ionable yet not ridicu-lous, dressing modestly and elegantly.\nThis is one situation where the adage\n\u201cless is more\u201d does not apply.\n\n"

Two years\nlater, Europe suffered its first syphilis\nepidemic. Coincidence? Some think so,\nbut others have argued that the syphi-lis-causing bacterium, Treponema pal-lidum, was introduced into Europe\nwhen Columbus and his crew returned\nfrom their voyage, having got up close\nand personal with the natives.\nThe evidence supporting the Columbian hypothesis of syphilis spread has\npreviously been limited to paleopatho-Columbus' holiday in Barbados: new study indicates he brought some rather nasty baggage back to Europe\nlogical data. The characteristic scars\nthat syphilis leaves on the bones of its\nvictims have been found on 7,000-year-old skeletons from the New World,\nwhereas virtually no such marks have\nbeen seen on European skeletons predating Columbus\u2019 voyage. But many\nscientists do not consider this skeletal\nevidence to be conclusive.\nA team of American scientists has\nattempted to solve this 500-year-old question using molecular genet-ics. Kristin Harper and colleagues at\nEmory University in Atlanta used an\nevolutionary biology technique called\nphylogenetic analysis to construct an\nevolutionary tree showing the relationships between different strains of\ntreponemes \u2013 the family of bacteria\nthat cause syphilis and other related\ndiseases \u2013 from 26 locations around\nthe world. The resulting phylogenetic\ntree sheds light on the order in which\nthe different strains of treponemes\nemerged.\nUsing this approach, the researchers\nwere able to show that the strains of\nbacteria that cause sexually transmitted syphilis arose relatively recently\nand are closely related to South American bacterial strains causing yaws, a\nsimilar disease transmitted via skin-to-skin or oral contact. This finding provides strong support for the Columbian hypothesis.\nIn contrast, the yaws-causing strains\nfrom the Old World arose early in human history and were similar to strains\nfound in non-human primates, suggesting that yaws is an ancient disease\nthat has evolved with us since the divergence of humans and chimps.\nIn light of their findings, the authors\nsuggest that non-sexually transmitted\ntreponemes first evolved in the Old\nWorld before being taken to the Americas by migrating humans, where they\nevolved into the progenitor of sexually\ntransmitted syphilis. This strain seems\nto have been taken over to Europe during the renaissance, and it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that Columbus and his\ncrew were the culprits.\nAlthough, with decreasing worldwide incidences of these diseases making patient samples more and more\ndifficult to obtain, we may (fortunately)\nnever know the full story.\nTamsin Osborne\n\u201cSyphilis bacteria\nstrains are\nclosely related to\nSouth American\nyaws strains\u201d\n\u201cEuropean\nskeletons from\nbefore 1493 do\nnot show the\ncharacteristic\nscars of syphilis\"\nSyphilis ahoy! Seems the Santa Maria's sailors weren't that saintly...\nSyphilis leads to scars on bones. Intriguingly, none were present on\nEuropean skeletons before Columbus' trip. The new study reveals\nwhy: syphilis evolved from a New World strain of yaws bacteria\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 18 January 2008 felix\nArts\nHey, can you guess what I am, yet?\nEver thought you\u2019re too rational to be a real artist? Michael Cook meets the little robot that could\nI\nthink we can all agree that some\nthings in life are designed to be\nkept separate. For instance, I try\nnot to practice my weightlifting\ntechniques at the same time as\nmy lying-on-a-bed-of-nails party trick,\nfor obvious reasons. My subscription of Meat Weekly, with free sample\nof bloody animal flesh, tends to get\nthey don\u2019t lend themselves well to art\nbecause they\u2019re always trying to make\nthe lives of the humans that use them\neasier, and we don\u2019t always want that.\nArt\u2019s about struggle, not about paper-clips popping up and offering you assistance in venting your soul.\nBut this perception of computers\ncould be about to change, thanks to a\nartiste.\nDr. Colton has done much work in\nComputational Creativity, the field\nof getting machines to work in a way\nsimilar to humans when we create and\ninvent, but The Fool is his most crowd-pleasing achievement. and it\u2019s easy to\nsee why. The Fool doesn\u2019t just look at\na photo and make a rough copy of it.\nThe pictures you can see littering this\npage have been thought about in great\ndetail. The materials, the brushstrokes,\neverything. The Fool isn\u2019t a glorified set\nof Photoshop filters. It\u2019s a machine that\nwants you to feel something when you\nlook at its work.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m creative myself yet,\u201d\nthe project website states, in a slightly\nunsettling first-person tone, \u201cI mainly\nwork from digital images to produce\nartworks.\u201d\nNow, that might not sound like\nmuch, but to fully understand The\nFool\u2019s talent you have to learn a little\nabout the other key members of the\nteam - namely Maja Pantic and Michel\nValstar.\nPantic and Valstar aren\u2019t strictly Creativity researchers. Their real strength\nlies in Machine Vision, the sort of technologies that can use images and film\nto analyse people and places. When\nthey were brought into the project and\ntaught The Fool how to understand\nwhat emotions people were feeling,\nthe creative options really began to\nopen up.\nLate last year the team began to use\ntheir newfound knowledge of human\nemotion to make a series of paintings\nbased on the happy, happy film Amelie. Over 220 portraits were made from\nvarious stills in the film, all capturing\nthe main character in different kinds\nof emotional states. Each painting, as a\nresult, is a unique blend of styles, media and colour. The full gallery, which\nis viewable online, is an extremely impressive end result.\nWith a new surge in confidence,\nThe Painting Fool was ready to enter\nthe big leagues and begin looking for\nthat thing every child prodigy craves\n- appreciation for their art. And so in\nDecember last year Simon Colton and\nMichel Valstar took The Painting Fool\nto the annual Machine Intelligence\nCompetition, sponsored by Electrolux\nand held on behalf of the British Computing Society in Cambridge. Though\nthe third member of their team, Dr.\nPantic, was too ill to attend, The Fool\nstill performed to its best.\nDespite technical difficulties, The\nFool performed two live portaits in just\nfifteen minutes, one on Michel and a\nsecond on a member of the audience.\nThe results, all of which are available\nonline, show just how well The Fool\ncan now react to new subjects and set-tings. Deservedly, the team received a\nprize for the best live demonstration,\ngiving a huge boost to the research\nand, of course, The Fool\u2019s needy artistic ego itself.\nThe story of the first cyber-Cezanne\ndoesn\u2019t stop there, though. Colton and\nhis team are already looking ahead to\na far harder, but arguably more crucial milestone - making The Fool paint\nsomething from imagination alone.\n\u201cOne of the tests of creativity is using\nimagination,\u201d Dr. Colton told the London Metro, \u201cI want to get the computer to do this to a create a new image.\u201d\nThe little fella (lady?) himself is pretty\neager, too.\n\u201cImagination is not something that\nis easy to simulate. I\u2019m currently working on painting scenes which don\u2019t ex-ist. I hope to launch a new gallery of\nthese images in early 2008. Watch this\nspace...\u201d\nWhy is it so much harder to do? It\u2019s\npartly because of the way such technologies work. At the moment, The\nFool\u2019s strength comes from knowing\nhow to analyse what it\u2019s seeing. But\nfor humans, we don\u2019t have to be seeing something without eyes to commit it to paper. The world of free-form\ncreativity is still unconquered, but Dr.\nColton and his creation look like one of\nmailed to my home address rather than\nmy vegetarian best friend\u2019s. So when\nI\u2019m relaxing in the leather armchairs\nof the Felix Office, beret in hand and\nbrandy glass resting on my head, I have\nto fight hard to keep myself from blab-bering inanely about all things Computery. I can confess it to you all \u2013 I\u2019m a\nComputer Scientist.\nAt this point it\u2019s probably worthwhile\nlisting everything that computers have\never done for the world of the arts, and\nthey would be as follows: Adobe Illustrator, digital cameras, those funny\nlittle audio guide things you get at the\nV&A and that\u2019s about it. Even with\nthese three, many people would argue\nthey\u2019ve not made much of a contribu-tion. The Adobe suite in general seems\nto provide \u2018artists\u2019 with a quick shortcut\nto the end, digital cameras have killed\nthe individuality and \u2018rough\u2019 feeling\nto film photography, and those audio\nguides are always narrated by someone\nirritating.\nThat\u2019s the problem with computers \u2013\nresearch project in Imperial\u2019s Department of Computing that\u2019s really beginning to come of age. In Imperial\u2019s\nglamourous Huxley building, past\nthe XKCD comics pinned on doors\nand people swearing at monitors, a\nwhole host of researchers, Professors\nand more are hiding the Department\nof Computing\u2019s Artificial Intelligence\ngroup.\nLeading up a team of Machine Intelligence researchers, Dr. Simon Colton spends much of his time thinking\nabout how to get machines thinking\nabout how they themselves think. If\nthat sounds complicated to you, imagine how it is for Dr. Colton\u2019s team.\nNevertheless, in 2001 they gave birth\nto a very special baby. The Painting\nFool was born.\nThe Painting Fool wasn\u2019t like many of\nthe clever ideas born in the Computing\ndepartment. It had something special,\nsomething that made it stand out. Other ideas just wanted to be clever. The\nFool, however, wanted to become an\nthe best opportunities yet to do so.\nBut there are many who feel that\nperhaps conquering it wouldn\u2019t be\nsuch a good idea. Certainly, there are\nthose who feel uneasy about the idea\nof a robot talking to us, or asking us to\ndo things, but those fears are generally\nborne of the notion that computers\ncan\u2019t do anything remotely humanlike.\nThe Painting Fool goes to show that\nthis isn\u2019t the case.\nDoes this mean that we\u2019ll feel more\nat ease with the idea of artificial intelli-gence? Will seeing the softer side of the\nwires and chips make us more open to\nrobotics? Or will this ghost from the\nmahine actually make us even more\nworried that one day, we could have\ncreated something that at least seems\nto understand us all too well.\nFor my part, I think The Fool goes\nto show that computers and humans\naren\u2019t all that different. The research\nmakes me hopeful, too, that in the future computers could be put to use in\nways that are currently unimaginable.\nBut when I\u2019m sitting in the Felix offices\nwith my beret and my brandy, trying\nvery hard to look reflective, I have to\npretend otherwise.\nThe best you can do is decide\nfor yourself.

    "content": "felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editors \u2013 Ahran Arnold and Nadine Richards\nAfrica and its magnificent people\n4th Year Medic Ammar Waraich visited Africa last summer. Over the next few weeks he will be detailing\nhis trip in Felix. This week he introduces his travels and talks about some of his key experiences\nI\nmperial is not generally regarded\nas a university that allows much\nfree time to its students and for\na reason beyond my compre-hension, Medicine at Imperial is\nconsidered to be a discipline that gives\neven less free time. So I hope you can\nimagine my bemusement when I found\nmyself staring at a gaping 4 month\nholiday at the end of my 3rd year as an\nImperial Medic (which, incidentally, I\nthought was the easiest year in my education after Year 10 at school).\nI had taken 2 long gap years before\nuniversity specifically to travel to various parts of the world. Due to my Pakistani nationality at the time, and the\nimplied visa restrictions, the heart of\nadventure and romance that is Africa\nwas off-limits. Nevertheless, things always have a way of working themselves\nout and so, with a newly-acquired British passport, I was determined to use\nthis gargantuan holiday to explore Africa! I was confident I had the money\nthanks to a healthy income from my\ngap years, but the actual \u00a34000 expense\nwas a rather crude surprise when I totalled it upon return and humbled me\nto my first-ever maximum overdraft!\nDuring the 2 months I spent abroad I\nfocussed on East Africa; visiting Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo.\nNow, a few important details you\nneed to know to get you up to speed\nwith my state of affairs. I got around\nusing all the local means of transport,\nwhether it be the matatu, the boda-boda, or even the 4 seater saloon taxi\nthat 9 people are expected to cram into\n- 5 people in the back and 2 people on\neach front seat, including the driver\nseat! I couldn\u2019t speak any of the local\nlanguages so relied on the few Englishspeakers or those who understood my\nbody language - although when it was\ndraped in a 20 kilo rucksack and 2 bags,\nI imagine it would be a little more difficult to interpret. I stayed for more than\nhalf of my trip with local families, getting acquainted with all things African,\nbut otherwise crashed in the dingiest\nof hotels, mingling and making friends\nwith the natives. I ate mostly local\nfood, but sadly it is not something I am\ngoing to remember Africa for, with a\nstaple diet of tasteless Ugali and various boiled vegetables.\nThe final vital detail I wish to convey\nis that I travelled alone. Naturally, I was\napprehensive about doing so but I feel\nthis was very much the defining factor\nin all that I learnt and experienced. It\nforced me to trust the strangers I encountered and dissolve better into the\nmany environments I chanced upon. It\nwas definitely a daunting situation to\nbe in when, for example, encountering drunken adolescents with machine\nguns or huge gangs of glue-sniffing\nkids in the slums, or even when some\nof the strangers you trusted tried to\ntake you away from the direction you\nknew you should be headed. These\nsituations were made worse by the fact\nthat I nearly always had \u00a3800 of camera equipment on me and cash split\nup into a few separate very secretive\nstashes. Thankfully though, the only\nthing I ended up losing on my whole\ntrip was a bottle of Pantene Pro-V and\nthe vast majority of the interactions I\nhad were pleasant!\nHowever, by far the most daunting\nsituation I found myself in was being\nstuck in the middle of Congo with only\n7 US dollars to my name and with rebel\nfighting closing in from all sides! I had\nno means of transport or accommodation nor any associates, or a common\nlanguage for communication, and I\nneeded at least 50 odd dollars to escape via bribing officials and boarding\na boat! All before the gunfire got close\nenough to be audible! More on this\npredicament some other time\u2026\nAnyway, it is nevertheless still with\nconviction that I call Africa the world\u2019s\nmost stunning continent and its people\ntruly the most beautiful people in the\nworld. I will talk more about the natural beauty and the awesome landscape\nwhen I cover the diverse wildlife of Africa, but for now I want to talk more\nabout its grand people!\nI had presumed a lot of danger and\nhassle, and even though that may have\nbeen the case in some parts of the largest cities, the reaction I got from most\npeople was anything but. Perhaps I had\nbeen lucky and not come across trouble or maybe the fact that I was in rural\nparts for most of my trip had a part to\nplay. Regardless, I just want to share a\nfew situations with you that I want you\nto imagine happening in Britain or, for\nthat matter, in any other developed\ncountry.\nIn Uganda, a travel operator from\nwhom I bought a permit (at no profit\nto him) comes to my camp site to drop\nthis permit off but then gives me a tour\nof Kampala, takes me to enquire about\nfurther transport, chats to me for a\nlong while about the horror of living\nunder Idi Amin and then refuses to accept money for his time.\nAt the village of Kinigi in Rwanda\npeople become incredibly fascinated\nby my lighter skin tone. A huge crowd\nof 30 plus children follow me for above\nan hour while adults stare from behind\nthe safety of a door or window. The\nbravest of the children attempt to communicate with me with \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018how\nare you\u2019 before running away giggling\nwhilst others repeatedly call me mw-zungu, which means a white person.\nThe hair on my arm generated a lot of\ninterest, as body hair amongst locals is\nunheard of, and received much attention and stroking, as one would a pet!\nAll this was the result of sincere curiosity at my different appearance but\ncame without the slightest bit of mal-ice. It left me feeling like the latest addition at a zoo but nonetheless elated.\nA woman who nicknames me \u2018Mr\nPakistan\u2019 haggles for 20 minutes on my\nbehalf to get me a cheap taxi; random\npeople on the street invite me to join\nin with them in their street-size game\nof Ludo; a motorcycle taxi driver takes\na big detour from an agreed trip to help\nme find a shop that sells chocolate and\ntakes no extra cash for it; etc.\nI have so many stories like these that\nthere is no way I can relate them all and\nno way that I can tell you how welcome\nthe people of Africa made me feel. Everyone was warm and not conceited,\nwith the culture imparting on me a\ngreat sense of decency and dignity. For\nexample, when I was staying alone in\nhotels, many people invited me to have\ndinner with their families. Moreover,\npeople really respect each other and\nbeing a practicing Muslim I never\nfelt any hostility even when I prayed\nThe insane matatu stand in Kampala\nMy new best friends\n24 felix Friday 18 January 2008\n\n"

They\nare found in foods like full-fat dairy\nproducts such as cheese, butter, full-fat\nmilk and yoghurt. Fatty red meat such\nas sausages, salami and luncheon meat\nalongside processed and fried food\nsuch as pies, pastries, pizzas, takeaways\nand snacks like crisps and confection-ary, all contain saturated fat.\nAlso be aware of trans-fats, these\nbehave like saturated fats and aren\u2019t\nalways listed on food labels but they\nare mostly found in foods containing\nhydrogenated oils used in processed\nfoods like pies, pastries, biscuits and\nother snacks.\nPoly-unsaturated fats have been\nshown to lower blood cholesterol levels\nand therefore help in reducing the risk\nof heart disease. Omega 3 and Omega\n6 are essential fatty acids and as our\nbodies cannot manufacture them, we\nmust consume them in our diets. You\ncan find these in foods such as oily fish\nlike mackerel, salmon, trout, herring,\nsardines as well as in sunflower, corn\nand soya bean oils, seeds, nuts \u2013 wal-nuts, almonds, and soft poly-unsatu-rated spreads are also good sources.\nMono-unsaturated fats help to lower\ntotal blood cholesterol and can help\nto prevent certain cancers and heart\ndisease. These are found in olive oil\nand rapeseed oil (containing Omega\n9), nuts \u2013 peanuts, avocados and soft\nmargarine spreads.\nThe current recommendation is that\nwe should take in no more than 33% of\nour total calories from fat. Saturated\nfat should account for no more than\n10% of our total calorie intake because\nof its harmful effects on our health.\nThe rest of the calories from fat should\ncome from mono-unsaturated or po-ly-unsaturated fats because these are\nmore beneficial to health.\nIf you read through the list of saturated fats and are feeling slightly bad as\nover the Christmas holidays you have\nconsumed all if not half of the types of\nfood listed, then don\u2019t worry\u2026. to start\nthe New Year off try reducing the type\nof fats you eat by replacing the bad fats\nwith the good fats. If you cut down on\njust some of these you\u2019ll not only lower\nyour cholesterol level you might even\nlose some of the weight you may have\nput on over Christmas too!\nSome tips to help reduce the fat in\nyour diet are as follows; use semi-skimmed or skimmed milk instead of\nfull-fat milk , switch to a low-fat spread\ninstead of butter or margarine; eat\nmore chicken and fish and less red or\nfatty meats, choose lean cuts of meat\nand trim off all the excess fat; grill,\nbake, steam or microwave food rather\nthan frying it; try low-fat varieties of\ndairy products such as cheese and yo-ghurt. Choose poly-unsaturated cooking oils or mono-unsaturated olive oil,\navoid high-fat snacks such as crisps,\nbiscuits, cakes and pastries, try to limit\ntakeaway to once a week or less and finally look for the word \u2018hydrogenated\u2019\non food labels and try to limit these\nfoods.\nFatty fat fat fat, yep we\u2019re\ntalking about fats\nHolly Plumley\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nOn your marks...\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the old saying\n\u201cfail to prepare and prepare to fail\u201d.\nWell this applies to a lot of areas from\nyour group presentation for university through to the tactics you might\nuse playing a rival team and this saying especially applies to the topic of\nthis article - warm-up, cool-down and\nstretching.\nSo its January the swimming pool\u2019s\nheaving full of people, parks are packed\nwith runners and the gym\u2019s busier than\nthe bar on ACC night, what do you do\nfirst?\nThe first thing should be to get on a\nC.V. (cardiovascular) machine to raise\nyour body temperature and heart rate\nsteadily for between 5-10 minutes e.g.\na treadmill, bike, rower, cross-trainer\netc (you get the idea). Usually at some\npoint in the warm-up you might see\nsome people do some static stretches.\nThese should be saved for after the\ncool-down at the end of the workout,\nas static stretching before exercise has\nbeen shown in numerous studies not\nto have an effect on injury prevention\nwhen done in the warm-up and can\ndecrease power production.\nWhat has been shown to be much\nmore effective is a movement specific\nwarm-up otherwise called \u2018dynamic\nstretching\u2019. Before we go any further,\nthis is not where we get our leg warmers out and bounce about with flailing\nlimbs everywhere looking like we\u2019ve\nbeen electrocuted. These are controlled movements to develop our range\nof movement so that the body will be\nin an optimal state to start exercising.\nI recommend you do between 6-8 repetitions of each dynamic stretch. Some\nexamples are explained below;\nA bodyweight squat works on your\nhip and lower body muscles. Bent\nknee forward bends work on hip and\nhamstring muscles. Arm circles work\nout the upper body and shoulder mus-cles, finally exaggerated clap with arms\nwork on the upper body muscles.\nWith that all done, you are ready to\ngo into the main part of your workout\nbut what happens when you\u2019re finishing up? Well the cool-down should\ntake between 5-10 minutes on a cardiovascular machine with the emphasis\nBen Richens\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\non taking the heart rate and body temperature down. This can be done by\ngradually decreasing the speed/resist-ance of the machine as you get to the\nend of your workout giving the body an\nopportunity to get rid of waste products it produces during the session.\nSo onto stretching - this part is crucial for targeting any tight areas of your\nbody and to increase the rate of your\nrecovery (so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve\nbeen run over by a truck the next\nmorning). Hold the stretch for anywhere between 20-60 seconds (the less\nflexible you are in that area the longer\nyou hold it), make sure you breathe\nand as the time goes by relax into the\nstretch more but don\u2019t force it (a good\nguide is if your face has a screwed up\nconstipated look, then you\u2019re forcing\nthe stretch). Pay attention when you\nget into the stretch that both sides of\nyour body feel an equal stretch- especially if you are stretching one side at\na time. If one side does feel less flex-ible, spend more time on that side to\ngain an equal amount of flexibility and\ntherefore balance.\nIf you\u2019re unsure how or what dynamic\nor static stretches to do, please ask one\nof the instructors in the Ethos gym.\nOne for the ladies!\nBeer belly/fat\nChips/French fries \u2013 yep you\u2019ve guessed it, full of fat\n\n"

I shop at Tesco,\nfor instance, and I buy\ntheir own brand of juice\ninstead of that Ocean Spray nonsense.\nI think Irish people are more trustworthy because they sound like they\u2019re\nall grinning inanely when you speak\nto them in tech support centres. I\u2019ve\nwatched at least two programmes with\nJimmy Carr in them. Yes, it\u2019s true \u2013 if\nthere were an election for Mister Man,\nthere\u2019d be no need for a recount.\nOne of the things you\u2019ve got to do to\nbe a Man Of The People\u2122 is to speak the\nthings the people want to hear. You\u2019ve\ngot to be in tune with them, you\u2019ve got\nto read The Daily Mail, you\u2019ve got to\nknow what matters to them. That\u2019s\nwhy, each week, I dutifully sit down in\nfront of the BBC News page entitled\n\u2018Have Your Say\u2019 and take in the varied\nand completely reasonable wisdom offered by the nation\u2019s finest debaters.\nThen I stop laughing at the little joke\nI tell to myself and start reading what\nthis week\u2019s Top of the Cocks have decided to offer up in the way of opinion.\nHere\u2019s a snippet from last week\u2019s hot\ntopic:\n\u201cThis government is not just happy\nin just taking our money but want our\nbodies as well.\n\u201d\nThanks for that, Jim from Peterborough. The \u2018Have Your Say\u2019 phenomenonisn\u2019tsomethingdreamtupatWhite\nCity by bored Beeb execs, of course, it\u2019s\nsomething indicative of the media as a\nwhole at the moment. The argument\nfor this kind of discussion starts, pre-sumably, at the very place that it ends\n\u2013 The Internet. The Internet is where\nthe really famous people are, or so it\nseems, because although Tom Cruise\nonly needs to poke a limb outside of\nhis house to appear instantaneously on\nfour magazine covers he doesn\u2019t hit the\nsame area of people\u2019s lives that those\non YouTube & co. do. Cruise is interesting when we\u2019re looking for enter-tainment, but that depressing chick\u2019s\nblog is interesting when we\u2019re looking\nfor nothing to do at all.\n\u201cSo now Gordon Brown can tax us to\ndeath and claim our dead bodies for\norgans. When will we rise up and stop\nthis NuLabour obsession with total\ncontrol?\u201d\nSome chap from Leeds, there. So the\ntheory goes that people on the internet become famous because they\u2019re\n\u2018real\u2019, and there\u2019s absolutely zero editorial filtering whatsoever. Opinion goes\nin, opinion goes out and that\u2019s either a\nwonderful thing or a recipe for mass\nsuicide depending on where you\u2019re\ncoming from. But hey, if YouTube can\nget attention like that just through allowing videos of Asian chicks jiggling\naround nondescript beaches, then why\nshouldn\u2019t serious things cash in on it\nas well? Because as we all know, only\nserious people watch serious things,\nand that means there\u2019s a veritable\nfucktonne of down-to-earth rational\ncommentary out there to be had. The\nmore people comment, the more people watch for comment, and the more\npeople get in the debate. Board meeting over. Pack up your Powerpoint,\nlove \u2013 you\u2019re hired.\n\u201cGordon Brown, what was WWII all\nabout when we stopped Hitler from using minority people for his medical ex-periments? And you want to bring back\nthe body snatchers? For Shame!!!!\u201d\nBetty Churchill invoking Godwin\u2019s\nLaw there, and disobeying the three-exclamation-mark rule like the liberation of the Nazi Punctuation Camps\nnever even bloody happened.\nIn case you\u2019re getting a bit perturbed\nby the offcuts from the site by now,\nthey\u2019re covering the deliciously tedious story that organ donation may become compulsory in the future. Now\nobviously, this was reported without\nexplicitly saying \u201cfor dead people\u201d after the word \u201ccompulsory\u201d, because\nthat\u2019s entirely implied by the fact that,\nyou know, that\u2019s how organ donation\nworks. Nevertheless the Have Your Say\npage reads like Brown\u2019s hand is already\nup your rear and fondling your spare\nkidneys.\n\u201cGordon Brown once again shows the\nOrwellian nature of those who presume\nto represent the Will Of The People,\nwhilst bringing in Laws & regulations\nfor which they have no mandate.\n\u201d\nHalf of this stuff doesn\u2019t even make\nany sense \u2013 there\u2019s one man who explains that he\u2019s suddenly \u2018reminded\u2019 of\na Monty Python sketch involving an\norgan donor, but offers no other argument whatsoever, suggesting that the\nonly reason this occurred to him was\nbecause there wasn\u2019t really anything\nobjectionable to say, he just felt the\nneed to stir things up. And it\u2019s not all\nridiculous \u2018Fuck The System\u2019 types ei-ther, take a look at this:\n\u201cI believe that people who won\u2019t sign\nup to donate their organs should also be\nplaced on a parallel list not to receive\nany.\n\u201d\nAnd these are the kind of people who\nare asking for \u2018compassion\u2019 and \u2018humanity\u2019 in their comments. This is why\nthe organ donation story exhibits it so\nwell, there\u2019s a division between the two\ncamps of comment writers that\u2019s only\nslightly more voluminous that the presumed gap between themselves and re-ality. There\u2019s more than a hundred and\ntwenty pages of repetitive shit on there,\neach page growing slightly angrier and\nslightly more obscure as the moderators get lazier and start letting any kind\nof rubbish in, namely the people who\nthink New Labour are stockpiling human hearts for an army of androids\nwith which they\u2019ll install a totalitarian\nregime.\nAll right, this is one of the reasons\nit makes such compelling reading for\nup-their-own-passages people such\nas myself. It\u2019s great to look it over and\nsnort at the fact that these people think\nthat the Government are trying, liter-ally, to steal things from our cold, dead\nbodies. But while the BBC might have\nlittle or no understanding of the kind\nof people that comment on things on\nthe internet, they do understand that\nthey don\u2019t need to. Because no matter\nhow bizarre or weird, how downright\nabsurd these ideas might be, they are\nideas Of The People, and that means\nthat when something like this crops\nup:\n\u201cTypical nulab - regards even the\ndead as their property! Taxes the peasantry in life & then claims the body as\nwell!!!\u201d\nWho cares if it\u2019s nonsensical bullshit?\nTwo hundred and twenty eight people\n\u2018recommended\u2019 the comment. And if\nyou can\u2019t offer a video of a chap lighting his own farts then I suppose that\u2019s\nthe next best thing.\nA. Geek\n\u201c\nCruise is\ninteresting when\nwe\u2019re looking for\nentertainment,\nbut that\ndepressing\nchick\u2019s blog is\ninteresting when\nwe have nothing\nto do at all\n\u201d\nD\nespite being one of the\ncutest members of the\nanimal kingdom, the\nYangtze river dolphin,\none of the most majestic\nsymbols of Asia, is all but extinct. It\nnow holds the record of being the first\never cetacean to be driven to extinction from human activities.\nThe creature, known as the \u2018Goddess\nof the Yangtze\u2019 locally and the baiji\ninternationally, was the reincarnation\nof a princess in Chinese mythology.\nForced by her family into a marriage to\na man she did not love, she chose to\ndrown herself and was reincarnated as\nthe river dolphin.\nAlthough the baiji was listed on the\nInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list as \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019 for several years, its\npopulation was allowed to dwindle\nbelow numbers from where it could\nrecover. Anthropogenic factors were\nmost responsible, such as the decreasing water quality of the Yangtze. Pollution, pumped out from existent and\nemerging industries and growing urban populations along the riverbank,\ncaused serious health problems for the\ndolphins. Toxic chemicals, absorbed by\nsmaller fish the baiji preys on, persisted\nin their bodies once consumed. Their\nlevels became more concentrated as\nthey moved up the food chain, causing\nblood poisoning and tissue damage for\nthe baiji population. Noise from the\nheavy river traffic interfered with the\ncommunication system used by the\ndolphin, leading to impaired breeding\ncycles and the occasional unfortunate\ncollision with boats and machinery. Intense fishing activity was also to blame,\nwith many animals caught as by-catch\nin long nets spanning the river basin.\nAlthough a few of those lucky enough\nto be disentangled survived, most died\nfrom combinations of weariness and\nstress. The habitat of the baiji had been\ncontinually restricted by the construction of several dams, most notably the\nThree Gorges Dam near Sandouping.\nHemmed in, and with oceanic salt water at the other end, there was no where\nsafe for the dolphin to turn.\nEven as conservational sirens were\ngoing off and efforts made to preserve\nthe baiji, all failed due to mismanagement and the classic case of too little,\ntoo late. Of the two females captured\nand brought to the Baiji Dolphinarium, one was past reproductive age\nand the other died after just 17 days.\nThe last male at the sanctuary, Qi Qi,\ndied in 2002. A scan of the river by the\nInstitute for Hydrobiology, Wuhan in\nDecember 2006 failed to find a single\nspecimen and pronounced the species\nas \u2018functionally extinct\u2019. A last, contentious sighting was made in August\n2007.\nBut why should we care that some\nsmall, out-of-the-way creature has dis-appeared? The grass is still green; both\nGNP, life expectancy and quality of life\nis still high. What does it matter to us?\nDue to the increasing interdependence of the world economy, the problems of one country become the problems of many. A recent downturn in\nthe American real estate market illustrates this, with the UK\u2019s economy\nhampered by the global \u2018credit crunch\u2019.\nThe economy of China is currently a\nmajor driving force in world economics and is closely tied to the state of\nChina\u2019s environment.\nToo often, environmental care is\nseen as a burden, an additional luxury to those rich enough to afford it.\nHowever, environmental messes cost\nScorpio\nChina\u2019s princess six feet under\nmoney both in the short term (such as\nnegative health effects) and in the long\nterm (such as flooding from deforestation and global warming). Just as in\nmedicine, it is cheaper to prevent the\nproblem rather than cure the \u2018illness\u2019\nlater on. China currently has one of\nthe worst environmental records, with\nrocketing greenhouse gas and CFC\nemissions, rampant deforestation, habitat loss, widespread soil erosion and\ndesertification. The air quality of many\nChinese cities are amongst the worst in\nthe world, and land salinization due to\nexploitation of groundwater supplies\nhas crippled vast tracts of agricultural\nland. Many of China\u2019s native plants and\nanimals are also faced with extinction.\nTheir combined role in the Chinese\necosystem does jobs that would otherwise cost billions of pounds, such as\nnitrogen recycling, soil regeneration,\nmaintenance of the water cycle, pest\ncontrol and decomposition of material wastes. Their importance extends\nto much more than just income from\ntourism. As China develops, its growth\nwill halt early and abruptly if it does\nnot effectively and sustainably manage\nits environment.\nThe Yangtze River dolphin should\nserve as a wake-up call to us all. The\nGulf of California\u2019s vaquita porpoise\nnow holds the dubious honour of the\nmost endangered cetacean on Earth.\nWe cannot afford to let it go the way\nof the baiji.\nDriven to extinction by humans\n\u201c\nEven though\nconservational\nsirens went off\nand efforts made\nto preserve the\nbaiji, all failed\ndue to a classic\ncase of too little,\ntoo late\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\n\n"

If he sets off a simultaneous blast, it counters yours in\na sort of quid pro quo defence mecha-nise, gem-to-gem. More interestingly,\neach of the twelve characters has his or\nher own counter set that he or she deviously sends your way with a successful detonation. All these realisations\nswirl in your mind like some sort of\nHollywood movie flashback (person-ally, it\u2019s a little black-and-white filter\nwith a glow effect and with some colours remaining in contrast for me) as\nyou get back into the game.\n(Sonic?) Boom! You\u2019ve linked up an\nadjacent column into one uber-gem!\nNow is the time to chuckle. Revel in\nyour glory! You can imperceptibly notice your brother flinch as he screen-watches. Your eyes get bigger with\neach adjunct as your precious baby\ngem is now a behemoth waiting to be\ntouched by the fuse. He fumbles as you\nstart muttering \u201cWhere\u2019s the sparkly\nthing? Where\u2019s the sparkly thing?\u201d.\nIt\u2019s not coming and your brother is\nmassing up his gem defence.\nShit.\nHey, there it is.\nRows of gleaming teeth that easily matches the dazzling gem appear.\n\u201cPwnage time\u201d, you can\u2019t help but gloat.\nAnd yes, it\u2019s pronounced \u201cP-own-ej\u201d.\nIt\u2019s almost touched. Hell yeah.\nWarning [12].\nWarning? What warning? Why warn-ing? How warning?\nAnd with a little patter, a row of\ntwelve numbered gems neatly pile on\ntop of your heap.\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence and utter disbelief as your explosive finale is\nblocked by the simplest of gems.\nPG-13 be damned.\nFuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.\nNo, matter... there\u2019s still time, there\u2019s\nstill time...\nA few more detonations here and\nthere and oh-my-god-Ken-you-gay-bastard-you-did-not-just-give-him-the-gems-he-needed....\nRemember that defence he was pre-paring? Well now it\u2019s a big bloated\ngreen... thing. With tinier green gems\nadjacent to it like little green things\nsuckling on a great big green mother...\nthing.\nC\u2019mon. What are the odds of getting\na green detonator. eh?\nStill doubtful, you look up to see\nwhat portends.\nTwo yellows. Grin.\nAnother of your detonations returns\nthe favour as you whoop for joy as a\nlayer of your own gems candy-coat his\nbloated innards. A few more and he\u2019ll\nhave reached the top and you\u2019ll have\nwon, nay, pwned him particularly since\nyou put all that hard work to nought.\n\u201cWhat can you be getting next, eh?\u201d,\nyou snort.\nOh look, it\u2019s a diamond with a normal green gem attached.\nYour grin becomes plastered to your\nface but your eyes reveal the same horror that is akin to finding out that the\nonly toilet is clogged. And you had\nsome of the Chilli Con Carne at the\nUnion. On a bad night, at that.\nJust to spite you he doesn\u2019t even let\nit drop immediately, rather allowing it\nto gracefully fall. It touches. The diamond sets off a chain reaction that\ndestroys absolutely everything of the\nsame colour.\nShinkuuhaaaaadouuuuukeeeeeeen!\nWarning [99] is followed by a series\nof epilepsy-inducing flashes of lights as\nRyu\u2019s hyper-deformed body lays waste\nto the hapless Ken.\nAnd your gem collection turns into\nan ashen pile of nothing.\nKaaaaaaak.\n\u201cShut up\u201d, you instinctively snap at\nyour brother. The cheeky bum knows\nthat his silent victory leads to a far\ngreater sense of superiority mainly because it just lets you sulk moodily.\n\u201cRematch?\u201d he asks with grace.\nA gruff nod of the head and both of\nyou are yelling at the top of your lungs\nagain.\nAfter four hours of non-stop under-cutting, abetting and provocation you\nrealise something quite interesting.\nHere you are playing a redux of an\nold game with quaintly iridescent\ntwo-dimensional graphics and worse\nstill, non-HD low-resolution character sprites and you\u2019re having the time\nof your life \u2013 on a piece of hardware\nthat can output visuals reminiscent of\na Pixar film. In fact, that very game \u2013\nRatchet & Clank: Tools of Destruction\n\u2013 sits right in front of you.\nAnd you know what? You\u2019re probably\nhaving too much fun to give a damn.\nAn epic match surges on as Chun-Li cheekily taunts Ryu, blissfully unaware of the dreaded diamond that has cost many a player dearly\n\n"

Even\nthe countries of the West are not immune to its effects; Al-Qaeda leaders\nrepeatedly cite the Palestinian cause in\ntheir anti-West manifestos and inter-views. Peace between the two sides is\nthe preferable option not just for the\ntwo sides, but for the Middle East and\nthe world. International leaders too\nshare that hope; President Bush, on his\nfirst visit to Israel last week as President, said he saw \u201ca new opportunity\nfor peace here in the holy land and for\nfreedom across the region.\u201d But how\ndid one of the world\u2019s longest-running\nand deadliest conflicts start in the first\nplace, and how can it be resolved?\nSince 1948, when modern Israel declared its independence (following the\ncontroversial UN Partition Plan), conflict has raged throughout Israel, Palestine and the wider Middle East over\nland in the area. Israel fought several\nwars with the Arab states in 1948, 1967\nand 1973, extending its borders and\noccupying the Gaza Strip and West\nBank. In 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded.\nIts central principles included the destruction of Israel via armed strug-gle, and that pre-1948 Palestine is the\nindivisible homeland of the Palestinian people. The PLO and its factions\nfought a running battle with the Israeli\narmy for decades.\nBy 1993, however, both sides had\nbecome willing to meet for talks, and\nthe Oslo Accords, the first face-to-face\nagreement, was agreed upon as the\nframework for peace. The democratic\nPalestinian Authority (PA) was created\nin exchange for the PLO\u2019s recognition\nof the state of Israel. However, progress\non key issues began to stall throughout\nthe 1990s; the final blow was struck at\nthe 2000 Camp David summit when\nArafat refused to accept a proposal\ndrafted jointly by the US and Israel.\nLater that year, the al-Aqsa intifada be-gan, the second major uprising by the\nPalestinians against Israel.\nThe \u201croad map for peace\u201d, a plan proposed in 2002 outlined by George W.\nBush, stated that the PA must adopt\ndemocratic reforms and abandon the\nuse of terrorism, and in return Israel\nwould accept the authority of the new\ndemocratic government. After retaliatory attacks continued unabated, the\nroad map stalled, with the Palestinian\nauthority unable to prevent terrorist\nattacks on Israeli targets. The conflict\ncontinued for several years while attempts to resuscitate the peace deal\nfailed; Hamas\u2019 rise to power in 2006\nand its failure to recognize Israel put\nfurther strain on the process.\nIn November 2007, representatives\nfrom the two sides, the Arab League,\nEuropean Union and United Nations\nmet in Maryland in the United States\nfor the Annapolis Conference, the\nmost recent in a series of peace confer-ences. For the first time, the attendees\ncame to the conclusion that a two state\nsolution would serve as the framework\nfor later talks. There are several key\nissues that must be solved, including\nthe Israeli settlements, the right of return for Palestinians, the status of JeIsrael has been at the centre of international controversy since its declaration of independence in 1948\nrusalem and the occupied territories.\nWhat progress has been made on the\ndifferent issues and how will they be\naddressed in the future?\nIsrael\u2019s continued position on the occupied territories is that most of the\nWest Bank and the entire Gaza Strip\nmust become part of a Palestinian\nstate. In 2000, the Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak offered Palestinian\nleader Yasser Arafat the opportunity to\nestablish a state comprising the Gaza\nStrip and 92% of the West Bank. Arafat\nrejected this, citing Barak\u2019s opposition\nto a Palestinian right of return. Some\nPalestinians claim they are entitled to\nEast Jerusalem, as well as the whole\nof the Gaza Strip and West Bank, but\nIsrael rejects this because of security\nconcerns. Others, including Hamas,\nargue that Palestinians must also control the whole of Israel; the group also\nviews the entire peace process as \u201cas\nreligiously forbidden and politically\ninconceivable\u201d.\nThe Israeli government has been\nwilling to concede on the issue of its\nPalestinian settlements, enacting the\nGaza Pull-Out plan in August 2005\nto remove all Israelis from the Gaza\nStrip and some from the West Bank.\nIts settlements of the region have been\nviewed by the international media as\nan obstacle to a resolution of the con-flict. However, no further concessions\nhave been made; some Israelis and\nsupporters of the two-state solution\nbelieve the settlements should remain\nso long as their occupants accept Palestinian rule.\nAnother contentious issue is the Palestinian right to return; the current\nnumber of Palestinian refugees stands\nat approximately four million. The\nIsraeli government argues that allowing refugees to return to their original\nhomes (many of which are in what is\nnow Israel) would create a Palestinian\nmajority and undermine Israel\u2019s status\nas a Jewish state. Critics of the right\nto return state that Palestinians were\nmade homeless because of the Arabinitiated 1948 war. However, several\nUN resolutions call for refugees to be\nMatthew Whitworth\npermitted to return to their homes\n\u201cat the earliest practicable date\u201d. Little progress has been made on what is\nperhaps the most difficult issue.\nRegardless of the differences on both\nsides, progress is steadily being made\non the issue, and despite suspicion\nfrom some quarters on both sides of\nthe peace process, both sides generally\nagree that a peaceful solution is mutually beneficial to constant conflict and\nsuffering.\nFrom top: Ken Livinstone, Boris\nJohnson and Brian Paddick\nGeorge W Bush made his first visit as president to Israel this month\nCampaigning has started for the\ncoveted position of Mayor of\nLondon which polls on May 1st.\nLabour candidate and Mayor for\nthe past eight years Ken Livingstone has said he wishes to see\nthe 2012 olympics while still in\noffice. The controversial figure\nknown through the 1980\u2019s as\n\u2018Red Ken\u2019 for his hardline socialist views has overseen enormous\neconomic growth in the capital.\nHis most enduring legacy, how-ever, may well be the congestion\ncharge he introduced during his\nfirst term which now means private motorists must pay \u00a38 to\ndrive into the centre of town.\nHe faces strong compettition\nfrom conservative candidate Borris Johnson, and Liberal Democrat Brian Paddick.\nMr Paddick was the police forces\u2019 highest ranking openly gay\nofficer before starting his career\nin politics. The Oxford graduate\nin Criminology says his main policies are to reduce violent crime\nand make the city \u2018greener\u2019. He\nalso claims to be the only serious alternative to the incumbant\nmayor, a jibe at Mr Johnson who\nhas been described as an \u2018embarrassment\u2019 to the Tory party.\nWith the worst turnout of\nany large election the last time\naround, at 37%, campaigners\nwill be hoping for greater partici-pation. Felix Politics urges YOU\nto vote! Even if it\u2019s for the BNP\n.\nLondon Mayor Election box\n\n"

    "content": "felix@imperial.ac.uk\n29\nFriday 18 January 2008 felix\nTechnology\nMacworld: Join the Cloud\nJames Finnerty reports on Apples new releases and what they\u2019ll do for you\nThey made the MacBook thinner... doesn\u2019t this just encourage our society\u2019s obsessions with losing weight? Only joking; it\u2019s pretty cool though\nA\nt 5pm on Tuesday night\nSteve Jobs kicked off his\nkeynote speech at this\nyear\u2019s Macworld. People have been expecting\na lot from the wealth of rumours and\nhype that has been floating around\nand he's not one to disappoint. His last\nbig announcement was the iPhone and\niTouch, so let\u2019s see whether or not he\u2019s\nstepped up to his own marker.\nThe new line of Mac laptops were\nannounced, dubbed \u2018Air\u2019. They fall between the existing MacBook and MacBook Pro lines; their forefront feature\nis its unbelievably thin form factor\n(19.3mm to 4.1mm) and its light weight\nof 1.36 kilograms. It also has a respectable battery life of five hours and the\noption of being provided with a solid\nstate hard disk. With such a small case\nthere will always be a compromise, and\nthe Air is no exception. There is no optical drive, no wired LAN ports only\nwireless, only a single USB 2.0 and the\nbattery is not user-replaceable. A new\nexternal Apple Superdrive (DVD read-er/writer) will be available for when\nyou want to use discs in your Air, but\nsince there is only one USB port you\nwill have to remove whatever other device you are using at the time, which\ncould become more than annoying.\nThe trackpad features improved multi-touch, so it can function in ways more\nsimilar to the iPhone, than its more\nbasic existing counterparts. The asking\nprice for these puppies is a whopping\n$1,800 dollars, which is a lot considering ultimately it has less features than a\nMacBook Pro- we should see them in\nthe region of \u00a31,200-\u00a31,500, whenever\nthey become available on our side of\nthe Pond.\nLED backlights have also been introduced on the new Macbook. Now what\ndoes this mean for you? Well they use\nless power so you get more battery, less\nspace so thinner screens, they turn on\ninstantly so no waiting and they also\nprovide a brighter and more uniform\nimage for your viewing pleasure. I\nwonder when Apple will get OLED\u2019s?\nAnother step has been taken into\nsolid state disk products by Apple as\nyou can order one as an option inside\nyour Air. It\u2019s not as clear-cut as this\nthough: this adds a ridiculous $1,300 to\nthe price tag, as well as losing 14GB of\ndisk space but it does offer prolonged\nbattery life and reduced boot times.\nWhether users will feel this justifies the\ncost is yet to be revealed, but I think\nyou can assume they probably won\u2019t.\nOne question that is looming in my\nmind over a thinner MacBook is the\nfact that existing models suffer from\nnumerous overheating related prob-lems. Surely this type of problem will\nonly be made worse by a thinner housing but we will have to wait until they\nhit the market before we can get any\nfacts and figures that dispell or validate\nthese worries.\nApple TV has also been revamped\nto feature HD functionality as well\nas 5.1 Sound and you will be able to\ndownload most existing content in\nHD for only 20% more than Standard\nDefinition. Apple hopes this update\nwill bring the popularity of this line of\nproducts up to a level more on par with\nsome of its other products. To aid this,\nthe existing of edition of Apple TV is\nreceiving a healthy price cut. Apple TV\nis serviced entirely online and doesn\u2019t\nuse an aerial or anything like that, so\nit\u2019s not a US-only product. You can get\nthem over here but as mentioned pre-viously, they are not massively popular\nand therefore are not so well stocked.\niTunes has been updated to allow\nmovie rentals. The user pays a different price based on the age of the film\nand whether or not it is in SD or HD.\nThe dollar prices are reasonable but\nwe'll see how these translate over here.\nThis service is intended to be up and\nrunning by next month and by the end\nof February, Jobs claims it will have a\ndatabase of over one thousand films.\nProviding this service will hopefully\nentice many people who do not use\niTunes to start to. It really applies a\nfantastic alternative to going out and\nrenting films, it\u2019s cheaper and there is\nmore on offer without having to remember to take the damn things back.\nThe real question is whether or not\nthis will deter people from downloading illegal copies of films?\nAlso the Time Capsule has been an-nounced. It's an extension of Apple's\nAirport extreme product, which is\nmore or less a wireless router but with\nsome associated Mac friendly good-ies. The Time Capsule also includes a\n'server grade' hard-disk which when\ncombined with OS X Leopard\u2019s allows\nfor automatic remote backups by the\nhour. It also still includes all the Airport's features such as being able to\nhost a wireless printer. A 500GB version and 1TB version are planned and\nthis product may start to become more\nof a must-have for the existing Mac\nuser.\nA smaller release is a set of five applications for the new(ish) iPod Touch.\nThese applications all exist on the\niPhone but use the device\u2019s free mobile Internet package to function. The\nTouch versions will be modified to suit\nthe fact the device will have intermittent WiFi Internet connectivity. Included are Mail, Maps, Stocks, Weather,\nand Notes which can be downloaded\nfor a small $20 fee, but we will have to\nwait and see how many people are willing to front more cash towards their\nrelatively new iTouch.\nDon't go thinking the iPhone hasn't\nseen anything new, it has, but it\u2019s quite\na minor update compared to the other\nnew stuff. Most of its built-in applications have had updates and new features added to make them more func-tional, for example, video playback\nhas been enhanced. The iPhone was\nHeadlines we\ncouldn\u2019t fit in\nYou\u2019d think he\u2019d retire, but he\u2019s not done making money yet\nI\nmight run this every week if\npeople think it\u2019s a good idea.\nBasically this will be a little column tucked away at the side\nthat contains a set of hidelines\nthat we thought you might like to read\nabout but didn\u2019t want to have to write\narticles for. A quick search on a well\nknown internet seach engine should\nchurn up some interesting articles on\neach of them.\nalso celebrating its four millionth sale,\nhowever Apple had hoped for over five\nmillion by this time. Still, 20,000 sales\na day is amazing for a first generation\ndevice for a manufacturer\u2019s first step\ninto a new market. Even though this\ndevice has been very slow to come into\nthe UK market, it\u2019s already secured a\nfoot hold and doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down. It would be very nice to\nsee Apple come out with some more\nphone models.\nUnfortunately no updates were released for the existing MacBook lines\nto keep them cutting edge, which is a\nbit of a shame as the feature set is starting to become a little stagnated. Hint:\nget multi-touch pads put in the older\nMacBooks. I think we can let Steve and\nhis friends off on this one, but just this\nonce.\nSo to conclude, it appears that Apple\nhas decided not to pull its army back\nand wants to drive forward to take even\nmore market sector away from any\nother company thats dares to compete.\nThey have produced new hardware,\nsoftware and services which should\nsecure their front running position for\nat least another year, leaving us to look\nforward to next year\u2019s Macworld.\nHungaraian\nScientists\nrelease dog bark\ntranslator\nTom Cruise\nScientology video\nleaked\nAmazon defies\nFrench courts over\nshipping costs\nFBI to gain access\nto UK biometric\ndatabase\nFacebook asked\nto remove\nScrabulous app\n1 million people\nnow use BBC\niPlayer\nIntel face court in\nNew York\nBill Gates retires\nSun buys MySQL\nNokia closes\nGerman factory\nEMI to cut 2,000\njobs\n33-Megapixel TV\nbeing developed in\nJapan\n\n"

The last two weeks I\u2019ve been\nin my finals and as such haven\u2019t been\nable to do the pages; therefore I left it\nto a \u2018competent\u2019 member of the Felix\nstaff. So firstly, an apology to the Energia staff for managing to have the same\narticle from last term in there again, as\na peace offering, and counting for the\nfact that many teams haven\u2019t really got\ninto the new season, we\u2019ve got a bumper fitness issue that will surely help you\nget rid of that Christmas podge.\nSecondly, there was a mistake in\nthe football article, where James \u2018The\nShadow\u2019 Skeen was a co-writer and inventor of the ingenious, and very witty\nheadline (if you remove the \u2018a draw\u2019\nbit. Also, if you still happen to have last\nweek\u2019s issue to hand, and have some\nspare time, see if you can find the hidden animals in the football report.\nAnd yes, as was briefly mentioned\nlast week, the league table has been\nupdated to include the medics. Also a\nquick note here, the table and the fixture and results section will only work\nif you all get your results in on time, so\nplease try to do so. Also, keep those reports coming in, guys.\nFinally, a note on what to expect this\nterm. Plans are underway for a special Varsity pull-out in the week after\nVarsity (27th February). I\u2019d like to ask\nALL THE TEAMS if they could make\narrangements for a match report to\nbe written, along with a picture of the\ncaptains, more news to follow!\nHitting the Valleys\nCycling Club hit the valleys of Wales for their winter tour. See page 33\nSo Christmas and the New Year have\ncome and gone. You\u2019ve over-indulged\non turkey, chocolate and alcohol and\nyou thought about buying larger-sized\nclothes in the sales, as your old ones\nare a little tighter than before. You\u2019re\nfed up as the party season is over and\nexams are looming. Not to be deterred,\nyou have sat down, taken stock of your\nlife, and set yourself some New Year\nresolutions.\nNow answer me this: how many of\nthose resolutions have you broken al-ready? How many of the others have\nyou actually thought about doing since\nyou proclaimed them to the world on\nNew Year\u2019s Eve? Don\u2019t feel bad if you\nhave failed some already. It doesn\u2019t\nmean you have to give up completely.\nJust start again but this time write\ndown a plan of action of how you are\ngoing to achieve them. Most resolutions are broken or never happen because we say we are going to do something but never actually have a set plan\nto follow. You wouldn\u2019t jump in the car\nand decide to drive to Elgin without\nfirst consulting a map and planning\nyour journey (it\u2019s somewhere in Scotland by the way, but hopefully you get\nNew year, new you. Keeping those resolutions\nthe point).\nGood planning for your resolutions\nis all about setting the right goal from\nthe start. I have had many people come\nto me over the years and say that they\nwant to get in shape, lose those extra\nkilos, or improve their fitness levels\netc. for the New Year.\nMy first question to them is always:\nwhat exactly do you mean by improved\nfitness levels or getting in shape? How\nmuch weight is there in those extra\nkilos? Aerobic capacity, anaerobic ca-pacity, flexibility, maximal strength,\nhypertrophy, speed, agility and so on\nare all areas of one\u2019s fitness. Those extra kilos could be anything from 1 to\n20kg- or more! My point is to be as specific as you can. If you decide to take\na trip to Scotland, you have to decide\nwhich part to go to or you may never\nreally reach your destination. Another\nbig thing is that your goal also has to\nbe realistic. Sorry, guys, but if you are\nbuilt like a bean pole you are not going\nto be the next Mr Universe. That is not\nto say that you won\u2019t be able to increase\nyour muscle mass, but your genetics\ndictate that you are never going to be\na huge guy.\nOnce you have set a specific and\nrealistic goal (e.g. increase aerobic ca-pacity, lose 10kg) you can begin your\nstrategy to achieve it. Before doing anything else you first need to know your\nstarting point (my VO2 max is 28ml/\nkg/min, I weigh 115kg). For some\ngoals you can do this easily like weighing yourself. For others you may need\nmore specialised equipment or help,\nlike having your VO2 max measured.\nWhatever your goal, the main thing is\nto give yourself a starting point with\nwhich to reach it.\nOnce you have a goal and a starting\npoint you need to plan your strategy\nto reach this goal. This is actually the\ndifficult part. How do you go about\nreaching your goal? How are you going to measure your progress along the\nway and when and how are you going\nto do this? Decide how much time you\nwant to give yourself to reach your goal\nand again make this realistic. You are\nnot going to lose 10kg in 2 weeks!\nSo for example if your goal is to lose\n10kg in 20 weeks you may aim to lose\nhalf a kilogram a week. To do this\nyou need to create a calorie deficit of\naround 3500 calories a week. Are you\ngoing to do this by cutting your calorie\nintake in your diet, burning more calories by exercise, or both? Where are\nyou going to cut the calories from in\nyour diet? How many days a week do\nyou need to exercise for and on which\ndays are you going to do this? How long\ndo you have to exercise for to burn the\nrequired number of calories, and what\ntype of exercise are you going to do to\nachieve this?\nThis may all seem like a lot of work at\nfirst but trust me if you can plan your\nresolutions in this much detail achieving them will be easy. I\u2019ve given you\nexamples of fitness-related resolutions\nbut the same strategy can be used for\nany resolution or goal you may want\nto set yourself throughout the coming\nyear. If your goal is a fitness-related\none, please come and speak to an Instructor at Ethos for further advice and\nhelp in achieving it. Whatever your\nNew Year resolutions are, good luck!\nAndy Mitchell\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nThe starting line for your New Year\u2019s resolutions\n\n"

    "content": "33\nfelix\nFriday 18 January 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nT\nhe first long trip of the\nyear and we decided\nto go to Cwmcarn in\nSouth Wales. I know,\nwhy would anyone\nwant to go to Wales?!? Well, there\nis some of the best riding in the UK\nthere and it is only just over 3 hours\ndrive from London. Cwmcarn is the\nonly place with its own uplift service on the downhill track running\n5 days-a-week and that means you\ncan get about 14 runs in without\nhaving to push up a single metre.\nThe cross-country circuit is 15km\nof pure single track and although\nthat doesn\u2019t sound like much, every\nmetre is technically challenging. As\nfor road riding, Brecon Forest is just\nround the corner with miles of open\nempty tarmac.\nBeing a Friday night I wanted to\nget out of London before the traffic started to build up, so I thought\nby 5pm everyone\u2019s classes should be\nfinished and we can pack the van,\nput the bikes on the trailer and be\ngone by 5:30. HA! Life is never that\nsimple. Having failed to book the\nminivan with a loading space, we\nwere left with a 15 seater minivan\nwith a tow bar. Fine, I thought, we\ncan take more people and just use\nthe Club\u2019s bike trailer. But at 4:30 I\nfind out that the only minivan that\nyou can tow with is also the only\none with a huge loading space in\nthe back, which negates the need\nfor towing. But the 15-seater has a\ntow bar!! Yes, but you can\u2019t use it\nbecause that would be against the\nlaw. So the only solution was to put\nthe bikes on the roof which is not an\neasy task when you have silly cross\n-country bikes made out of flapping\ncarbon fibre and road bikes which\nare made out of such thin tubing\nthat they are almost transparent.\nHaving left Imperial at 6:30 the\ntraffic was horrendous and it took\nus two hours just to get out of London not including a stop in Hammersmith to pick up James \u201cCannonball\u201d Coakley who was confused\nand astounded by the fact that TFL\nwouldn\u2019t let him take a huge downhill bike on the Tube at rush hour!\nThankfully it only took us two and\na bit hours once we were past the\nM25 and we got there by 11pm.\nThe Riding Centre is very\nwell organised and has\na Visitors Centre\nand Camp\nSite at\nthe\nbottom of the downhill track which\nis also where the cross-country starts.\nOh yes, forgot to mention that we were\ncamping, in Wales, in mid November, in a valley. But it wasn\u2019t that bad,\nfor me anyway, because as crazy as it\nsounds, I\u2019ve done this several times\nand I brought my skiing jacket with\nme. The wind gusting down the valley\nwas so strong that it took us several attempts to put up the 10 man tent and\nin the end we had to park the minivan\nin front to shelter us from the wind\nso that the skinny freshers didn\u2019t get\nswept up into the heavens.\nOnce the tent was up, the rest was\nplain sailing and we eventually managed to get some sleep. Well except for\nJason \u201cMonster T\u201d Vicente and Pambo\n\u201cNutter\u201d Palas, who being Portuguese,\nthought that camping was warm and\ncomfortable everywhere and decided\nthat they would only need a 2-season\nsleeping bag and no ground mat\u2026\nRising at the crack of dawn, we all put\nour bikes together and prepared ourselves for a full day of Welsh riding.\nThe cross-country route was tackled by \u201cFlappy-carbon\u201d Dave and\n\u201cSqueaky- brake\u201d Allan.\nKnown in the Mountain Biking community as a top-class Trail Centre, it\nfeatures some of the best single-track\nin the country. The route starts off with\na short climb to warm up, with plenty\nof technical sections shortly leading on\nto yet more climbing in order to reach\nthe top of the hill. The newly opened\nfree-ride area provided a chance to try\nout some drops and jumps before a fast\ndescent. After another short climb, the\ntrail emerges from the forest on the\nedge of the hill to provide views across\nthe valley. Another long, fast and technical decent ended the route back at\nthe car park. It\u2019s a lot longer that it\nsounds.\nRealising we had completed the loop\nin a record fast time of 1:15, we were\nready for another lap to see if we could\nbeat that. Reaching the top of the hill,\nit felt like a slower lap from how\ntired we were this time, but\non reaching the end\nwe set a new\ntime of\n1:08,\neven after Allan\u2019s fall practising\non the downhill track between\nlaps, providing a spectacle for a\nline of downhill bikers waiting\nfor the uplift truck.\nThe Lycra-clad gang, whilst\nembarrassing as they are, also\ngot in some good riding.\nWhat better way to overcome a biting wind on an\novercast day than to get out\non the open road in the rolling hills of a National Park\nand get those adrenaline\nand endorphin levels up?\nHaving bolted down a makeshift\nbreakfast, four of us (Basti, Wesley, Jason & Javed) left Cwmcarn for Brecon.\nWith a great spread in levels of expe-rience, we did well to stick together\nas a group until one long climb when\nwe made the decision to split up and\nmeet back together later. Jason headed\nfor a pub (we think) and Basti, Wesley\nand Javed headed off to do a 20-mile\nloop through the National Park. One\nparticular section will stick long in the\nmemory, a long, windy road through\nrolling hills, which thankfully the Top\nGear team weren\u2019t using for a supercar\nshoot that day.\nAfter a stop at a well-to-do pub for\na refuel we rejoined Jason, although\nmeeting at a roundabout wasn\u2019t a\ngreat idea as we were waiting at different roundabouts for ages! Another 20\nmiles on the A-roads had us back in\nCwmcarn ready for more food and a\nhot shower and reminiscing about the\nNational Park loop.\nAs for the Downhill lot, London may\nbe cold, the Arctic colder, but Wales\nwas something else... the wind of the\nprevious night cut through\nto our bones... much\nthe same way as\nthe ground\ndid the\nfollowing day \u2013\nlacking copious amounts of\nalcohol to ease the pain.\nNot used to riding in the UK, it was\nquite daunting for some of us to ride\ndown a track about as wide as our\nshoulders with what looked like a never\nending cliff to our right. Falling would\nresult in rolling down a mountain until you hit a tree... which you hope to\nGod would happen sooner rather than\nlater.\nWith this thought in mind, we decided to launch ourselves off the highest peak we could drive up to and try\nto reach the bottom intact. For the\nmajority of us this worked out fine.\nJames \u201cCannonball\u201d Coakley, however\ndecided it would be appropriate to\nplease the crowd and try new tricks in\nwhat is probably the fastest and hence\nworst place to do so, resulting in some\nserious damage to both ma and\nmachine. Luckily\nhe was able to limp away leaving\njust his ego on the floor behind\nhim. As for his bike it needed to go\nto A&E.\nAfter the first run, and having\nseen our lives flash before our eyes,\nall that was left was to get back in\nthe van and go at it again but FASTER, trying many different tracks-some more pleasant and less painful\nthan others. All in all, the diversity\nof the tracks, the great group, and\nthe warm hand-dryer in the bathroom made the trip a really kick-ass\nexperience.\nHaving had a good day\u2019s riding by\nall we packed up and made our way\nback to London at an electronically\nlimited 62mph in the minivan.\nHitting the Valley\u2019s\nImperial College Cycling club hit the valleys in Cwmcarn.\nJames Atteck, Dave Topham, Javed Kamruddin, Jason\nVincent and Pambo Palas report\nWELCOME TO WALES\nfrom the cycling club\n\n"

    "content": "31\nFriday 18 January 2008 felix\nHead in the clouds in Snowdonia\nCreature comforts mean a lot more when you\u2019re roughing it out in the wild according to Charlie Rogers\nT\nhis Christmas four intrepid Fellwanderers set out\nfrom London on a mis-sion; Destination Snowdonia, Wales. Okay, Okay,\nmaybe \u2018intrepid\u2019 is not quite the right\nword; we didn\u2019t have to be very gal-lant, just silly enough to face the winter weather and to spend four days in\nclose proximity to ten members of the\nICMC (enough said!).\nSaturday 16th December and after a\nvery late start, 3pm (too much partying\non the last night of term) Charlie and I\nfinally headed out on the 7 hour drive\nto Wales via South Kensington to pick\nup Nick and Catarina, and New Cross\nto pick up Nathaniel.\nThree hours and a short lesson in\nhow all the gadgets and chairs work\nin my car later (it\u2019s amazing what you\nlearn about something you\u2019ve owned\nfor 5 years!) we made it to Tescos in\nEarls Court. Leaving Nathaniel and\nCatarina to find the seatbelts trapped\nunder the luggage, Nick and I did the\nweek\u2019s food shop, which when I got\nID\u2019d put a smile on my face for the rest\nof the week!\nThe rest of the journey was pretty\nuneventful and we arrived at St. Mary\u2019s\nhut just after midnight to be welcomed\nby the ICMC: blood, sweat and beer.\nDay One: After an incredible amount\nof early morning faffage we left the hut\nand headed straight to the hills. On our\nfirst day we decided to take it slightly\neasy and walk up Mynydd Mwar, 698m.\nSurprisingly the weather was fantastic,\napart from the winter chill, and stayed\nso for the whole week.\nThe start of the hike encompassed\nthe usual jokes about sheep, the odd\npatch of black ice underfoot and Nathaniel finding the most rock faces to\nscramble; but soon Catarina and I were\nstriding out for the girls, making it to\nthe summit about 10 minutes before\nthe boys (chocolate at the summit was\nour prime objective!).\nAfter a long lunch break at the top,\na phone call to Nick\u2019s mum and a cup\nof tea we started our own route down\nthe mountain. Thankfully it was pretty\neasy going due to ground frost hardening the otherwise boggy land, and\nNathaniel managed to only electrocute himself on the fences twice. Near\nthe bottom we noticed the sun rapidly\nsetting and decided to take a break to\nenjoy the spectacle. Of course this set\nus on a dream plan of hiking up Snowdon for sunrise during the tour, which\nnever materialised as we didn\u2019t make it\nout of bed before 7:30am.\nAfter the sunset we raced down the\nlast part of the mountain and along the\nroad to the hut stopping briefly to film\nNathaniel smash a 3ft by 2ft by 1 inch\nblock of ice over his head (words cannot explain our dear Nathaniel!).\nDay Two: Leaving Catarina in bed,\nNick, Nathaniel and I made an early\nstart (8:30am) and drove to Pen-y-pass\nto climb Snowdon. As the weather was\nlooking good we decided to take the\nharder ridge scramble onto Snowdon\nviaCribGoch.Thegoingwasfairlyslow\ndue to our need (or desire) to climb to\nthe top of every boulder avoiding the\n\u2018easier\u2019 path in places, but the views\nwere well worth every second and the\nhigher we got the more we could enjoy\nthe pressure inversion... We were literally walking on the clouds.\nAfter surviving the ridge climb, we\nfaced the relatively easy 70m final ascent onto Snowdon. I say relatively because what is usually the motorway of\nhiking paths becomes somewhat more\nprecarious in winds pushing 50mph.\nBut we\u2019d got this far and a \u2018little\u2019 bit\nof wind wasn\u2019t going to stop us. We\nfought our way forwards and eventually crawled up the steps to the trig point\nso as not to be blown over.\nSitting at the top admiring the view\nand holding onto our hats, we quickly\ndecided the safest way off the moun-tain, now the winds were ridiculously\nstrong and sunset was fast approaching (3:30pm), would be to go down the\nLlanberris Railway path and bus back\nto the car. This route is possibly the\neasiest onto and off of Snowdon and\nthankfully plenty wide enough when\nyou get blown around by the wind,\nwhich we did on several occasions; I\nin particular had to be pinned down by\nNick a few times, though in hindsight\nI wonder if it was more for his protection than mine (Anchorage!).\nBy the time we reached Llanberris\nat the bottom of the track it was pitch\nblack (5:30pm), and being rather dishevelled it was only right to stop for\na hot chocolate and toilet break. After\n30mins we headed back outside and\nwaited for the bus... and waited\u2026 and\nwaited\u2026 and asked the next bus driver\nwhen there would be a bus to Pen-yPass... Buses don\u2019t run after 4pm in\nthe winter\u2026 problem! At this point the\nonly solution was to start walking, so\nputting our torches on we did just that,\ntrying to hitch-hike as we went.\nAfter a short while a builder stopped\nto give us a ride to the next village and\nwith the boys crouched in the back\nof the old Nissan and me in the front\nunable to fix my seatbelt we trundled\nalong to Nan Peris two miles down the\nroad. Once again we were on our own\nand walking to Pen-y-Pass. Eventually\nanother car stopped to give Nathaniel\na ride so he could pick up the car and\nreturn for Nick and me. After our little night time adventure we sped back\nto the hut, and to a very worried Catarina, and enjoyed a good bottle of red\nwine, sausage & mash and Christmas\npudding with brandy \u2013 an awesome\nway to relax at the end of the day!\nDay Three: Our third hiking day\nturned out to be a bit of a joke. After\nsleeping through the early morning\nalarm clock (I turned it off to snooze)\nwe eventually surfaced at mid-day! I\nblame the adventures of Snowdon the\nnight before, but regardless it did mean\nwe only had a few hours of daylight\nleft.With that we scouted the map and\nfound a forest walk in nearby Bedgellert and having dropped a poorly-off\nNick at the local pub, Nathaniel, Catarina and I headed out. Arriving at the\ncar park we discovered from a map\nthat the forest contained numbered\nposts with pictures of animals on. We\ntook a picture of the map and started\norienteering from a camera to find the\nposts. Meanwhile Nick was experiencing real wildlife in the form of a robin\nflying in and out of the pub.\nNavigation from the camera turned\nout to be pretty difficult in the end\nand with the fading light Nathaniel\ntook a compass bearing to find the car\nand easiest route back. We walked up\nand down the same track twice before\nNathaniel admitted he wasn\u2019t a very\ngood navigator. This didn\u2019t instil in\nme much confidence, but after a short\nwalk along a railway line marked on\nthe OS map as a footpath (clearly we\nneed new maps) we arrived safely back\nat the car and headed to the pub for a\npint. Oh, and for Nick!\nThat evening we enjoyed a good spag\nbol without the spaghetti (I had forgotten to buy), mince pies and whiskey;\nand Nathaniel and Nick cleaned out\ntwo buckets of ash from the stove so\nthat it would light properly (men and\nfire!).\nDay Four: This was our final day hiking and having packed up the night before we managed to have breakfast and\nfit our gear in the car pretty quickly.\nWe then drove to Trefriw in the Dryfryn Conwy Valley, with the intention\nof climbing Grinllwm and Cefn Cyfarwydd. Halfway along the walk Nathaniel decided he\u2019d take us on his \u2018special\u2019 route (straight up) which turned\nout to be more of a challenge than we\nbargained for. Nick who had already\nmanaged to crack his head ona low\ndoorway in the morning didn\u2019t take\ntoo well to the climb; he smacked a tree\nbranch into his ear and eye and eventually slipped over on a rock slamming\nhis shoulder into a boulder. Nathaniel\ntook this as a sign to move away pretty\nsharpish out of Nicks range, but by the\ntime we arrived at the top murder was\nno longer an option and everyone was\nhappy again.\nFor the rest of the day we kept to the\npaths, stopping briefly to push Nathaniel into an icy puddle, for Catarina\nto stroke two ponies and to enjoy more\nspectacular views during our lunch\nstop. In the end we didn\u2019t make it all\nthe way up Cefn Cyfarwydd as we\nneeded to head back to London via a\nfew route changes to avoid traffic and\nclosed motorways.\nAll in all the winter tour was a huge\nsuccess and a good end to the term for\nthe Fellwanderers; unbelievable weath-er, great food, good company and the\noccasional bit of hiking!\nThe Fellwanderers organise\nfortnightly weekend trips to the\nmountains, Sunday walks and\narrange tours further afield to the\nScottish highlands and the Alps.\nFor more information visit:www.\nfellwanderers.com or contact\nchristopher.mark03@ic.ac.uk\nMight have been nippy, but were the Fellwanderers downhearted? No! Fellwandering: for those not content to be mere armchair adventurers\n\n"

Daniel Burrows, the Chair\nof the RCSU Science Challenge com-mittee, will host the launch event. He\nwill be joined by the Rector of Imperial\nCollege, Sir Richard Sykes, who will be\ngiving a short seminar on the night.\nThe RSCU Science Challenge is an\nannual scientific writing competition\nopen to Imperial undergraduate and\npostgraduate students as well as school\npupils in years 11, 12 and 13. University students compete against each other\nto win a \u00a32,500 prize. School students\nwill be competing for \u00a32,000, double\nlast year\u2019s amount.\nMr Burrows believes \u201cthat as a society we must make challanging moral\ndecisions based on science\u201d and therefore \u201ca researcher\u2019s ability to convey his\nwork in a clear and consise manner to\npeople in the pub is crucial to our rapidly evolving world.\u201d\nEntrants will have to write an 800-word essay, however in a twist by this\nyear\u2019s organisers, the judges will each\nset a question and students will have to\nchoose which one (or ones since Imperial students can have multiple entries)\nthey most prefer to answer.\nThis year\u2019s panel of expert scientific\njudges includes the Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, fertility specialist Professor\nLord Robert Winston, Nature Editorin-Chief Dr Philip Campbell, BBC\nScience Correspondent Pallab Ghosh,\nShell Vice President Global Solutions\nDr Paul Snaith and the Director of\nthe Imperial College Grantham Institute for Climate Change, Sir Brian\nHoskins.\nEach judge (except Mr Ghosh) will be\nsetting and unveiling their own question in a weekly seminar held every\nTuesday at 6:30pm in 220 Mech Eng.\nThe first seminar will be given by the\nRector at the official launch next Tuesday 22nd January.\nThe idea behind the seminars is to\nallow the judges to explain why they\nchose their question. Science Challenge entrants are advised to attend the\nseminars where hints and tips on how\nto answer each question will be given.\nFor schools and students that can\u2019t\nmake the seminars, the Science Challenge is going online. Each seminar will\nbe recorded and streamed live over the\ninternet. To register, email science.\nchallenge@imperial.ac.uk. The setter\u2019s\nslide show will also be broadcast online\nsimultaneously with the live footage.\nThis year\u2019s Science Challenge has\ngenerated in excess of \u00a325,000 in fund-ing. The money is being put towards\nthe prize fund as well as the awards\nOn Wednesday, Imperial\u2019s Entrepreneur Centre launched its 8th New\nBusiness challenge, an annual business plan competition which this\nyear is offering prizes totalling \u00a342,000.\nThe winning 10 page plan will earn its team \u00a310,000 in cash as well\nas a further \u00a315,000 in business services. The two runners-up and 7\nfinalists will each receive \u00a35000 and \u00a31000, respectfully.\nIn her opening address, Sabrina Kiefer, Business Plan Manager for\nthe competition, stressed the broad range of benefits on offer to all\nparticipating students, from simply improving a CV to cashing in on a\ngreat idea. But for those looking to take their ideas into the business\nworld, the competition can provide a great deal more.\nMany previous winners have gone on to create successful businesses based on their entries. A finalist in the 2002/3 competition,\nOmlet (www.omlet.co.uk) is now an established enterprise selling innovative hi-tech chicken coups for domestic use. The competition\nalso boasts many big name sponsors such as Shell, Barclays Capital\nand IBM.\nTo help the teams develop their ideas, a series of six evening lectures are planned on such subjects as \u2018Raising finance for a new venture\u2019 and \u2018Protecting your intellectual property\u2019. There are also \u2018mentoring sessions\u2019, in which students can receive expert guidance from\nSainsbury Management Fellows.\n\u201cTo be successful, competitors will need to show initiative, com-mitment, and creativity in their business plans,\u201d said, Ms Kiefer. She\nadded that, \u201cthe competition is all about giving students a chance to\nexperiment in a realistic but safe environment.\u201d\nThe New Business Challenge is open to all Imperial students. Teams\nmay include competitors from outside the university, but must comprise at least 50 percent Imperial students.\nThe closing date for registration is Monday 11th February. More details can be found be found on the Imperial website.\nAndrew Turley\nMore of an entrepreneur than a scientific\nwriter? Win big prizes for business ideas\nceremony venue. Last year competition\nentrants were whisked off to The Ritz\nhotel in Mayfair where the prize winners were announced. This year\u2019s venue has yet to be confirmed, but with a\nsubstantial pot of money to draw from,\nthe RCSU committee is setting its sight\non something impressive.\nMr Burrows is working hard to ensure that the competition reaches as\nmany students as possible. Students\nwho sign up for updates on the Science\nChallenge website are entered into a\nprize draw for a Nintendo Wii at the\nawards ceremony on March 18th.\nHe is appealing for Imperial students\nto contact their old schools and invite\nthem to participate. Two extra tickets\nin the Wii draw are offered if students\nwrite to their old school about the\nChallenge.\nAll entries must be submitted by\nTuesday 26th February and the winner\nwill be announced on Tuesday 18th\nMarch.\nThe Challenge is principally\nsponsored by Imperial College\nand Shell.

    "content": "35\nfelix\nFriday 18 January 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nWarming winter nutrition\nGil Saville\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nThink of winter food and your mind\nconjures up images of thick vegetable\nsoups, and steaming stews. And sur-prise, surprise these are exactly the\ntype of foods you should be eating at\nthis time of year.\nWhen the days are colder you need\nmore warmth from your food and this\nis provided by these types of meals,\nwhere everything is cooked in one pot\nso no nutrients are lost and warming\nspices are added to increase the metabolic rate and send heat round the\nbody.\nNow in these days of air conditioning\nand central heating and travelling by\ncar from door to door, we may need this\nless than in the past, but the principles\nare the same. This is also not an excuse\nto throw all your summer healthy eating out of the window just because it\u2019s\ncold outside. The same principles as\nsummer healthy eating apply but just\nadapted to take advantage of all the\nseasonal vegetables available.\nWarming winter vegitables\nVegetables which are fantastic in winter include; sweet potatoes and pumpkin (always go for the orange varieties\nof both of these vegetables), squashes,\nturnips, swedes and parsnips.\nAll of these are high in Vitamins A\nand C, which will help build the immune system and ward off illness. Garlic is another good vegetable to eat at\nthis time of year as it has proven antiviral and anti-fungal properties and\ncould just help you stave off that cold.\nFor warming grains go for oats, quinoa and brown. Other grains are more\ncooling so if you are making or buying\nbread try not to make it the staple of\nyour winter meals.\nOther good winter ingredients in-clude: adzuki (or aduki), beans, black\nbeans and lentils. Actually any pulse\nwill do. They have been called the \u201cperfect health food\u201d - low in fat and high in\nprotein and complex carbohydrate and\nfibre. They also contain a range of vitamins and minerals and are low on the\nGlyceamic index, so what more could\nyou ask? They will add a welcome bulk\nto any soup, stew or vegetable side dish\nand are an excellent source of protein\nand Vitamin B for vegetarians and ve-gans. If you want to avoid some of the\nside effects of these high fibre foods\ncook them with fennel or cumin and\nmake sure you follow the preparation\ninstructions regarding soaking them if\nthey are of the dried variety.\nIt goes without saying that you should\nchoose foods from good sources and\norganically grown whenever possible.\nTraces of chemicals found in non-or-ganic foods often cannot be removed\nsimply by washing and over time can\nbuild up in your body tissues to unacceptable levels.\nWake up and smell the herbal tea\nYou may find that you feel a little down\nas the nights draw in. Do try to get\noutside, especially in the mornings as\nthe sun comes up. Natural light will\nhelp your pineal gland to switch off its\nnight-time melatonin production and\nact like a natural caffeine boost. Artificial light is not full frequency light and,\nas such, is not as powerful as sunlight\nat switching off the pineal and this why\nyou might feel more sleepy in the winter time.\nIf you are still not feeling 100% you\nmight want to try a multi-vitamin and\nmineral supplement. Try to buy the\nbest quality you can and make sure\nit is in the best form for your body to\nassimilate it. Generally fat soluble vitamins (ADE) are better in capsules\nand water soluble (BC) in tablets. And\nmake sure you get a good cross section\nof minerals to help with this too.\nJust because it is cold and you might\nfeel more inclined toward hot drinks,\ndon\u2019t forget your body still needs at\nleast 1.5 litres of water a day. If you find\nit too cold to drink chilled water, leave\nit to stand and drink it at room tem-perature. It is more re-hydrating that\nway anyway as the body doesn\u2019t have\nto use energy heating it to body tem-perature. If you really want a hot drink,\ntry a herbal tea instead of regular tea\nor coffee.\nThings to avoid\nTry to avoid eating too much dairy\nproduce. In general these are mucous\nforming and won\u2019t help if you are prone\nto colds or chesty coughs.\nYou can still get good quantities of\ncalcium from tofu, beans and dark\ngreen vegetables (such as kale and\nbroccoli, the purple variety in particu-lar, or by sprinkling some poppy seeds\non your food). Eat simple combina-tions. It may be tempting to stick as\nmany things as you can into a stew but\nyou are making it hard for your body to\ndigest them all. It doesn\u2019t give you the\nchance to appreciate the flavours too.\nTry to reduce your refined salt and\ncaffeine intake. (If you must have salt\ntry to find whole natural sea salt which\nis slightly grey.) This is good advice at\nany time of the year and even more so\nduring the winter when your lymphat-ic, immune systems and liver are busy\ntrying to keep you healthy.\nFollowing on from the last point try\nto avoid chemically altered or highly\nrefined foods. These will have almost\nnone of the nutrients that fresh foods\nhave and could actually be more difficult for your body to deal with.\nAll in all eat well, stay healthy and\nremember spring is just around the\ncorner!\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 IC Netball 1st 9 9 0 0 488 254 234 100 45\n2 IC Squash Men's 1st 9 9 0 0 45 0 45 100 45\n3 IC Tennis Women's 1st 8 7 1 0 56 23 33 88 37\n4 IC Tennis Men's 2nd 7 7 0 0 58 12 46 100 35\n5 IC Hockey Men's 1st 9 7 1 1 32 15 17 78 33\n6 IC Rugby Men's 1st 10 8 0 2 244 109 135 80 32\n7 IC Squash Men's 2nd 9 7 0 2 30 15 15 78 27\n8 IC Fencing Men's 2nd 5 5 0 0 660 525 135 100 25\n9 IC Rugby Men's 2nd 9 5 2 2 220 138 82 56 21\n10 IC Volleyball Men's 1st 6 5 0 1 10 2 8 83 21\n11 IC Volleyball Women's 1st 4 4 0 0 11 5 6 100 20\n12 IC Football Men's 1st 8 3 4 1 14 6 8 38 19\n13 IC Fencing Women's 1st 7 5 0 2 899 735 164 71 17\n14 ICSM Hockey Women's 1st 9 5 1 3 54 20 34 56 15\n15 IC Football Women's 1st 6 3 2 1 7 4 3 50 15\n16 ICSM Badminton Women's 1st 3 3 0 0 19 5 14 100 15\n17 ICSM Netball 2nd 6 4 0 2 161 132 29 67 12\n18 ICSM Football Men's 1st 7 3 2 2 11 10 1 43 11\n19 IC Badminton Men's 1st 9 5 0 4 41 31 10 56 9\n20 ICSM Hockey Men's 2nd 9 5 0 4 22 21 1 56 9\n21 IC Lacrosse Women's 1st 7 4 0 3 51 49 2 57 8\n22 IC Netball 2nd 7 4 0 3 205 165 40 57 8\n23 ICSM Rugby Men's 3rd 7 4 0 3 197 109 88 57 8\n24 IC Hockey Women's 1st 8 3 2 3 27 29 -2 38 7\n25 IC Waterpolo Men's 1st 2 1 1 0 17 14 3 50 7\n26 IC Badminton Men's 2nd 9 4 1 4 35 37 -2 44 6\n27 IC Hockey Men's 2nd 9 4 1 4 43 23 20 44 6\n28 IC Hockey Men's 3rd 9 4 1 4 17 17 0 44 6\n29 IC Basketball Men's 1st 3 2 0 1 207 176 31 67 6\n30 ICSM Netball 1st 7 3 1 3 243 256 -13 43 5\n31 IC Rugby Women's 1st 1 1 0 0 50 5 45 100 5\n32 ICSM Hockey Women's 2nd 9 3 2 4 28 40 -12 33 3\n33 IC Table Tennis Men's 1st 6 3 0 3 63 39 24 50 3\n34 IC Squash Men's 3rd 4 2 0 2 8 4 4 50 2\n35 IC Rugby Men's 3rd 9 4 0 5 165 147 18 44 0\n36 ICSM Hockey Men's 1st 9 3 1 5 20 35 -15 33 -3\n37 IC Table Tennis Women's 1st 3 1 0 2 4 11 -7 33 -3\n38 IC Squash Women's 1st 7 2 1 4 12 16 -4 29 -4\n39 ICSM Hockey Men's 3rd 3 0 1 2 4 9 -5 0 -6\n40 IC Hockey Women's 2nd 8 2 1 5 11 39 -28 25 -8\n41 IC Hockey Men's 4th 7 2 0 5 8 18 -10 29 -10\n42 ICSM Netball 3rd 7 2 0 5 132 178 -46 29 -10\n43 ICSM Football Men's 2nd 4 0 1 3 8 15 -7 0 -10\n44 IC Fencing Men's 1st 5 1 0 4 553 600 -47 20 -11\n45 ICSM Rugby Men's 2nd 10 3 0 7 152 273 -121 30 -13\n46 IC Badminton Women's 1st 7 1 1 5 19 37 -18 14 -13\n47 ICSM Hockey Women's 3rd 8 2 0 6 7 20 -13 25 -14\n48 ICSM Rugby Men's 1st 8 2 0 6 133 239 -106 25 -14\n49 IC Football Men's 3rd 9 1 1 7 11 31 -20 11 -21\n50 IC Tennis Men's 1st 9 1 1 7 26 64 -38 11 -21\n51 ICSM Badminton Men's 1st 6 0 0 6 11 37 -26 0 -24\n52 IC Football Men's 2nd 8 0 1 7 8 26 -18 0 -26\nACROSS\n1 Flatfish can flop round (8)\n5 Invent cosmetics (4,2)\n8 Arrange without an organization,\nespecially a UN body (6)\n9 Inclination towards writer song (8)\n10 Delight the way in (8)\n11 The road to Rugby ends in the bird\ncage (6)\n12 Possibly blas\u00e9 French-born Arab\n(8)\n13 Headless squeaker makes a new\ndiscovery (6)\n15 Soldier ants are huge!

There are never cells\ncontaining the number 4 in\nSlitherlink.\nSo, where do you start?\nThe most common place to\nstart on a Slitherlink grid is\nby drawing crosses around\nany zeros. Drawing crosses\nis purely done to so that you\nknow where there can\u2019t possibly be a line.\nThe internet\u2019s a good bet\nfor tips and tricks if you\u2019re\nstuck.\n\n"

The architecture is all fantastic (read: period),\nnone of those grotesque new builds\nor that nouveau warehouse farce. It\u2019s\nhome to The White Horse, that famously posh pub commonly known as\n\u201cThe Sloaney Pony\u201d, the London Oratory School, where Tony Blair\u2019s kids go,\nStamford Bridge and The Hurlingham\nClub. It\u2019s a Tory stronghold, soon to be\npart of the newly formed \u201cChelsea and\nFulham\u201d constituency and it certainly\nfits the stereotype. With the Chelseas\nand Mayfairs of London now solely reserved for the heirs of the world\u2019s various dynasties, I have surely hit upper-middle class heaven.\nAnd then the dream-shattering\nsharp return to reality. A group of kids\nwith hoods, odd haircuts, and frightening expressions approach on their\nbikes, slowing only to shout obscenities at a passing couple. Behind them\nan old man, reeking of urine, staggers\ndown the road in a camouflage jacket\nwith a can of Tesco Value cider. Just\na few minutes later a group of girls\nin their early teens walk by, barely\nclothed in the cold, with strange face\npaint and a spectacular assortment of\nArgos jewellery. Anyone who lives in\nLondon knows this scene well. We also\nknow how it comes about that members of Marx\u2019s lumpenproletariat or\nunderclass (not to be confused with\nthe working class) live in areas where\nthe average house price is three times\nthe national average. Any confusion is\ndissolved by what I see once I turn the\ncorner around the Town Hall. Surely\nthe tallest building in the area, this ten-storey monstrosity of the 1970s stands\nin stark contrast to the surrounding\nVictorian terraces.\nBritain is not the only country in the\nworld to have government-sponsored\nhousing built for those who could not\nafford homes otherwise but London\ndoes, however, stand out from most\nother Western cities in one respect; the\ndispersion of council housing amongst\nthe \u201crest of us\u201d.\nThe multi-million dollar apartments\nof Fifth Avenue are within reachable\ndistance of the slums of Harlem but\nbeing within commutable distance is\nsomething altogether different from\nliving right next door to. Well-off Parisians keep the poor well away from\ntheir central Paris property hotspots.\nIn London, however, we find billionaires who live quite literally right next\ndoor to people on welfare.\nWe complain about this no end; how\nmany times have you heard friends\nhave massive strops about the tower\nblocks in their area\u2026 from those who\napologise for nearby council housing\nwhen you visit, to estate agents who go\nout of their way to hide, or downplay\ntheir existence? It\u2019s an understandable\nsentiment; in most other countries in\nthe world the wealthy do not typically\nhave to worry about crime on their\nown doorstep. It only gets worse and\nmore frightening once you have chil-dren; talk of the kids playing outside is\nnaturally a London rarity\u2026 unless said\nkids wear Kappa tracksuits and/or are\npregnant. These estates can be a pain,\na blemish, the bane of one\u2019s existence\u2026\nand certainly one feature that the city\ncan hold proudly over its peers.\nFor kids in this city born into poverty\nto be placed in areas that offer a lifeline out is something that ought to be\ncelebrated, not bemoaned. The alternative to this is to designate certain areas solely for public housing where all\nthe underprivileged can live together.\nThese are known as ghettoes. Children\nborn into ghettoes are often raised in\nan environment where they are in a\ndestructive family, all their neighbours\nand associates are poor and uneducated and all their fellow school kids are\nfrom similarly hopeless backgrounds.\nUnsurprisingly, one of them breaking\nout and achieving great things is a rare\noccurrence. It is obvious that allowing\nthem to witness first-hand the \u201cbetter\nlife\u201d makes it much more likely they\nwill actually strive for achievement,\nreducing the prevalance of the multi-generational poverty curse that afflicts\nso many families.\nThis argument doesn\u2019t have to be\nentirely charitable. Having the estates\nspread out rather than bunched together makes the city as a whole more\npeaceful. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask\nthe people of Paris. Riots in that city\nneed only the lightest contemplations\nof policy change by French parliament\nas a catalyst for burning cars, maiming\npolice officers and raiding shops, behaviour virtually unheard of this side\nof the Channel. This is, of course, in\npart due to the violence-prone nature\nof French politics, but is only made\npossible in the 21st century by the fact\nthat the poor typically all live together,\nallowing easy organisation of such ac-tions. Before Rudy Giuliani, there were\nparts of New York City that even the\npolice refused to have anything to do\nwith. While you hear the occasional\ngripe about Brixton and Peckham, the\ntruth is these places are actually relatively harmless.\nThe presence of these estates will\nundoubtedly continue to cause great\nannoyance for the better-off. Many legitimate complaints about their existence may be made; I must admit I find\nit hard to stomach any policy that will\nallow the idle to potentially live better\nthan most hardworking people will\never have a chance to, but I also recognise it as, like many difficult political\nchoices, a better of two evils.\nNice area, shame about the estates\nAbioye Oyetunji comments on social housing and why \u2018we\u2019 shouldn\u2019t have to live amongst \u2018them\u2019\nLondon is a mosaic of wealth and poverty, where the world\u2019s millionaires share postcodes with those on state welfare\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nD\negenerate: \u2018having declined or deteriorated to\na lower mental, moral or\nphysical level; debased;\ndegraded; corrupt\u2019. Not,\ngenerally, considered to be a good\nthing. However, if you are a fan of Amy\nWinehouse (as I am) you may beg to\ndiffer!\nYou may also beg to differ if you have\nseen the Blyth Gallery\u2019s latest offering.\nLocated on the fifth floor of the Sherfield Building, this may be the only part\nof Imperial which is inviting. The gallery makes a nice change from a lot of\nthe other rooms we find ourselves in\naround campus and until 27th January,\nit offers us a chance to degenerate via\nthe work of Ellie Stanford, Ross Taylor\nand Jack Vickridge; three artists exploring and celebrating failure within their\nwork. One once remarked that a certain painting \u201clooks as though a three\nyear-old did it\u201d. You can also expect to\nsee quasi-spiritual scenes, Geometric Abstraction and places mysticised\nby an artist adopting a \u2018menopausal\u2019\nmindset. So, if you\u2019re in a particularly\nuninspiring lecture, get yourself off to\nthe fifth floor under the pretense that\nyou\u2019re off to the loo.\nSince we\u2019re on the subject of low\nmoral levels, I thought I might talk\nabout a new found love of mine; rock-and-roll (auto)biographies. Granted, if\nthe rock star in question decides that\nhe wants to write his own without so\nmuch as GCSE English under his belt\nthen the grammar, sentence structure\nand use of punctuation may be a little\nunorthodox. The entertainment value\nis also unorthodox in the moral and social sense, but that is exactly why they\nare so good. For some unknown rea-son, the recipe for success is to have a\nfucked-up childhood. So much so that,\nupon reading one rock biography after\nanother, the formula of no mother/\nfather figure, divorce, abuse (sexual\nor otherwise), drugs, girls/boys/both,\nkleptomania and poverty begins to\nget a little unoriginal. Unoriginal, but\nthoroughly interesting, nonetheless. I\nfind myself living vicariously through\nthese child-forms of icons such as\nSlash and Anthony Kiedis as I was derived of a deprived childhood and I will\nnever forgive my hard-working, loving\nparents for it! You can imagine my surprise when I learned upon reading My\nLife with and without Jim Morrison by\nhis wife, Patricia Kennealy-Morrison,\nthat this hero of mine had not only\ngraduated from high school, but also\nhad a degree from film school no less.\nLess can be said for Russell Brand. He\nis in no way, shape or form a rock star\nbut his book suggests he may as well be,\ndue to all his hedonistic and wild ways.\nI probably have a more active imagination than most, yet my mouth widened\nin awe at Brand\u2019s antics. When I put\nit like that, I feel a touch of guilt that\nI am revelling in the demise and destruction of others. However, most of\nthese characters have plenty of wealth\nto help heal the wounds of doing too\nmuch acid inside an abandoned house\nin the Hollywood Hills.\nShakespeare\u2019s Othello at\nDonmar Warehouse\nTickets to see Ewan McGregor star in Othello are not easy to come by but somehow\nCaz Knight has managed to get her hands on a couple and here is what she thought\nE\nxactly four hundred and\nthree years after it was first\nperformed to His Majesty\nKing James I in the Banqueting House of Whitehall,\nShakespeare\u2019s Othello is still creating\nmedia frenzy. Besides being made into\nan unremarkable, American-made film\nstarring unremarkable actors (O), the\nwork is currently attracting a lot of attention due to the caliber of thespians\nappearing in Michael Grandage\u2019s pro-duction. It stars Chiwitel Ejiophor (you\nmay recognise him from films such\nLove Actually, Hotel Rwanda and Kinky\nBoots) as the Moor, Othello, and Ewan\nMcGregor, in his first Shakespeare play\non stage, as the Ancient Iago.\nTo give one an idea of just how highly\nanticipated this production was, and\nstill is, tickets were auctioned on eBay\nfor thousands, although the actual figure varies with each review one reads.\nTickets are, sadly, still sold out, so unless you have that sort of money or are\nprepared to go to criminal lengths to\nget it then it is unlikely you will get\nto see it. Luckily, your very own Felix\nArts\u2019 editor did the seeing for you and\nis about to tell you all.\nFor those unfamiliar with Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy Othello, it is set in the\nworlds of Venice and Cyprus at the\ntime when England was under threat\nby the Ottoman Empire. The play begins in Venice, home city of our char-acters, where the cunning and mali-ciousness of Iago is presented initially\nwhen he exposes Othello and Desdemona\u2019s marriage to her Senator father.\nGiven the period in history, the shock\nof having one\u2019s daughter betrothed to a\nblack soldier would have been enough\nto suspect witchcraft on the part of\nOthello. The story continues with the\nplot moving to Cyprus as Othello, Iago,\nCassio and the rest of the militia aim\nto deflect the enemy in Cyprus. Iago\u2019s\nwife, Emilia, and Desdemona, join\nthem but as the enemy is defeated, Iago\u2019s role as evil Cupid continues as he\nweaves between characters and their\nromances, feeding them untruths, for\nreasons still unknown. Slowly, Othello\nis persuaded that his Desdemona has\nbeen unfaithful and is transformed\ninto the \u201cgreen-eyed monster\u201d with\ndisastrous consequences.\nThe Donmar Warehouse was the\nperfect setting with its black, sparse\nedifices, evocative lighting, meagre\nyet highly efficient stage dressings all\nteamed with beautiful but haunting\nmedieval music; perfect in reflecting\nboth the love and hate conjoured up in\nthe play.\nBreaths were bated as the audience\nwaited for the man himself to enter. At\nfirst McGregor is not particularly show\nstopping (pardon the expression). He\nis Ewan McGregor and does as good a\njob as we expect from such a great ac-tor, no more, no less. The duplicitous\nnature of Iago suits McGregor\u2019s ability\nto take on a variety of roles. The audience recognises the \u201chonest\u201d as well as\nthe evil side of Iago in parts they have\nseen McGregor take on in the past.\nGrandage\u2019s choice to have Iago shift\ncontinuously from centre stage to the\nshadows and back also reinforces Iago\u2019s\ndeceitful and Machiavellian nature.\nJaws really did drop at the performance given by hidden gem of an actor\nEjiophor, in his portrayal of the General Othello. He is utterly spellbinding,\nimpressive, eloquent and majestic in\nhis acting. He achieves great success in\nconveying the pendulous sadness and\ndrama of the last scene, which mirrors\nthe tragedy perfectly.\nIt is a credit to the cast that, not only\nwere they not totally washed away in\nthe tide of his stage presence, but also\nthat they managed themselves to each\nbring life into what is a very heavy play.\nKelly Reilly as Desdemona shines in\nthe run up to the last scene by creating\nhuge pathos and emphasising her character\u2019s vulnerability. Emilia (played by\nMichelle Fairley) momentarily steals\nthe show in her gripping and powerful\ntestimony against Iago and in her defense for Desdemona. Tom Hiddleston\nis very dashing indeed in his costume\nand, as Cassio, gives a superb performance which is undoubtedly on a par\nwith McGregor; great things to come\nfor him I hope, and am sure.\nThe three hours disintegrate as this\nparticular production of the thought-provoking Othello is made thoroughly\naccessible and one is able to truly appreciate Shakespeare\u2019s wit and why he\nis still revered as the greatest English\nplaywright.\nThe boys: McGregor (right) stars as Iago while Ejiophor (left) takes\nthe title role\nThe girls: Kelly Reilly (bottom) as Desdemona and Michelle Fairley\n(top) plays Emilia\n\n"

Find something an audience\nlike, and few directors can let it go.\nWorse still, find something that a director likes, and you find yourself becoming perhaps a little self-indulgent.\nSo why is it then, that the Coen brothers are so beloved?\nThe Coen brothers are not bad fil-mamkers, but at the same time they\nare not geniuses. Darlings of the Indie\nscene since their Eighties break-out,\nBlood Simple, they\u2019ve staked their territory as the popular outsiders and No\nCountry seems to have taken them full\ncircle. In style, this is very similar to\nBlood Simple; in everything else, it just\nseems slightly underwhelming.\nIn January, hype overtakes everything and it\u2019s very hard to judge a film\npurely on it\u2019s merits without rating it\nagainst your own expectations. This\nhas been billed as \u201cThe best Coen\nbrothers movie yet\u201d. It\u2019s not.\nIt\u2019s hard to say where No Country\nfalls down. The story follows three\nmen around the Texan desert: A hunter (Josh Brolin) who stumbles across\nthe scene of a drug deal gone wrong\nand walks off with a suitcase full of\nmoney he finds; an almost silent killer\n(Javier Bardem) with a pressurised\nThe Coen Brothers show why Thelma and Louise were right to try to avoid Texas\ncanister as weapon of choice; and an\naging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones), completely dumbfounded by the deaths in\nhis jurisdiction.\nJosh Brolin, who seems to play the\nsame character in about five films this\nyear, finds his strongest footing here\nwith a performance that is sadly being overlooked in favour of the others.\nBardem\u2019s silent killer is full of menace\nwithout seeming robotic, although his\nSocial realism is a particularly British field of filmmaking, mainly due to\nnational bore Ken Loach, yet it seems\nthat Romania have decided to be the\nones to explore its true heartbreaking potential. 4 Months, 3 Weeks and\n2 Days is perhaps the bleakest film of\nlast year, a mean feat when you consider the Iraq-centred war pieces that\nhave piled into the multiplex. That said\nhowever, the power of good filmmaking has rarely been so obvious.\nA lot has been said about 4,3,2 since\nit swept in and grabbed the \u201cPalme\nD\u2019Or\u201d at Cannes from the heavyweight\ntalent of the Coen brothers and Tarantino, yet the actual themes of the film\nseem to have gone unnoticed. The\ncentral storyline is one of black market abortion, set in the horrendously\ndepressing (and, apparently, extremely\nrude) Romania of the Eighties. It is at\nthis point that many people who have\nbeen crying out \u201cI really want to see\nthat!\u201d because they heard of it after\nCannes pull their hands down and pretend they never said anything.\n4,3,2 is not an easy film to watch, but\nis incredibly affecting if you can make it\nthrough (more than one person left the\nparticular screening I was in). It steers\nclear of making outright pro-choice\nor pro-life statements and simply ob-serves, but does so with such brutal\nhonesty that at least choice would allow for the service to be legalised and\nregulated as opposed to the illegal status it holds here.\nThere are several fantastic scenes\nthat show cinema at its most evoca-tive. The dingy hotel room to which\nthe friends hide out to keep the secret and the abortionist himself are\nthe stuff real nightmares are made of,\nnot a pantomime-like Freddy Krueger.\nThis is the power of the real in cinema\nin a way that hasn\u2019t been tapped into\nfor a long time, yet Romania are widely\ntipped for worldwide recognition of\ntheir new cinematic flare.\nWhether Romania will be the new\nforce of world cinema or not, it seems\nthat social realism is back on the map.\n4,3,2 has again decided that realism is\nthe realm of the depressing, so if you\u2019re\nlooking for a perky couple of hours\nthis weekend, stick with Enchanted.\nIf, however, you\u2019re still intrigued then\ndon\u2019t wait - the multiplex will want this\naborted as soon as possible.\nAlex Casey\nT\nhe month of January is, as\nthe old wives would say,\nsubject to the four-star\ncurse. As studios churn\nout awards fodder, everything seems to be \u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d and pretty similar to the year\nbefore. These are generally well made\nfilms, adeptly crafted but lacking any\nbite that would make them special,\nwhilst turning off conservative voters\nand hence generally land, regrettably,\nin the four-star region.\nThis year has been a bit different,\ngranted. Since Crash won awards a\nfew years back, all the awards bodies\nseem to have remembered they can\nnominate things released before December, but sadly this has meant that\nJanuary fare has slipped into steeper\ndecline. This was entirely encapsulated\nthis year by the exceptionally dire Kite\nRunner.\nOkay, so it\u2019s a foreign language film\nand isn\u2019t your typical Best Picture con-tender, but Hollywood seem to have\ndecided on cornering the non-English\nspeaking categories as well now. Check\nthe country of origin for this piece of\nsentimental bullshit, with less real\nemotion than Paris Hilton, and you\u2019ll\nfind it is actually American.\nAll the hallmarks are there, yet people seem to have swarmed to it because\nit\u2019s a foreign language film and immediately this rings bells that say \u201cLike\nthis!\u201d Why? It was predictable (slight-ly), wooden (undeniably) and easy\n(exceptionally). Trust the Americans\nto make it look so easy to just walk in\nand out of Afghanistan right under the\nnose of the Taliban.\nThere\u2019s a general problem with foreign language films, and that is that\npreconceptions often overwhelm\nopinion based on real merit. There\u2019s\nthe one school of people who stay away\ncompletely (\u201cI don\u2019t go to the cinema\nto read\u201d) and there\u2019s the others who go\npurely so that they can tell their mates\nat their next cheese and wine evening\nthat they saw Das Leben der Anderen\nthe other night. What one\u2019s that again?\n\u201cOh, in English it\u2019s The Lives of Others\u201d.\nOh. Fuck off, your four words of German off the poster do not impress.\nTo be fair, the quality control on foreign imports is higher.

Even without these fine brews, this would be a pub that is always well worth a visit if\nyou\u2019re nearby, but with these beers, poured fresh from the barrels lined up behind the bar, it really is hard\nto beat. With a slightly uneven floor and authentic wood panelling you can hardly believe that it\u2019s located\nin the City of London; definitely worth a visit.\nHereford Arms\n127 Gloucester Road\nGloucester Road Station\nNot quite as close as the Queen\u2019s Arms, it\u2019s still worth walking the extra ten minutes; and if you\u2019re\nin Evelyn Gardens this is unmissable. Whether it\u2019s stopping off for a drink on the way home or\ngoing to watch the football match (the big screen might be regarded as its biggest flaw), it\u2019s always\ngot a good range of food and ales. Combine this with a landlord who works tirelessly for it and\nyou\u2019ve got a pub this\u2019s always a good place to go for a drink or a meal.\nThe Carpenters\u2019 Arms\n12 Seymour Place\nEdgware Road Station\nJust down the road from Nutford House and a few other halls of residence, this pub is just a standard,\ndecent local \u2013 something increasingly hard to find in London. Even on the Friday evening when we\nwent in, it wasn\u2019t too busy, being just far enough from the City to avoid the suits and off the beaten\ntrack for tourists. With a small range of decent beers, it\u2019s certainly the best in the area.\nThe Ship and Shovell\n1-3 Craven Passage\nEmbankment Station\nThis unique pub is split into two bars on either side of the road, although at quieter times only\none is open. It can get reasonably crowded in the evening, but you can normally get a table\nor at least a decent perching spot, or just stop off for a quick pint before heading on to somewhere else. It\u2019s a Badger pub; but the brewery produces a decent range of beers, both cask and\nbottled, so there\u2019s normally something you\u2019ll want to drink (try Blandford Fly if you\u2019re more\nof a ginger ale fan).\nThe Market Porter\n9 Stoney Street\nLondon Bridge Station\nWith around 16 different ales on tap at any time, the biggest appeal of this pub is its variety.\nDown a back street behind Borough Market it\u2019s frequented by a mixture of suits and traders\nfrom the market alike. Whenever you turn up, you\u2019ll be lucky to get a seat but there\u2019s normally\nsomewhere to stand, and the crowd inevitably spills out onto the pavement.\nChapter Five \u2013 Pubs\nYe Olde Cheshire Cheese\n145 Fleet Street\nChancery Lane Station\nA real classic pub, you can quite easily get lost in the rooms and cubby-holes here. Combined with the lack of phone signal,\njust finding the people you\u2019re meant to be meeting here can be a challenge. However, it is a good pub and, like a few other\ncity pubs, is Sam Smith\u2019s, meaning that while it only serves a small range of beers, it serves them for prices which are incredibly low for London - \u00a31.70 a pint, anyone? Other Sam Smith\u2019s pubs are the Lyceum Tavern, Aldwych and The Rising Sun,\nCloth Fair, also worth a visit.\nWritten by Nick Hartley, designed by Rosie Grayburn\nThe Hansom Cab\n86, Earl\u2019s Court Road\nHigh Street Kensington\nIt\u2019s probably around about the same distance from High Street Kensington\ntube station as it is from Earl\u2019s Court. It\u2019s a bit out of the way from campus,\nbut if you\u2019re heading in the direction of Hammersmith you should stop\nby. A good number of traditional ales are on offer and you can get some\nhefty olives to chow down on whilst you\u2019re sipping away. The atmosphere\nis peaceful and there are a number of nooks and crannies to hide in with a\ngroup of friends. Chaps: beware when you go to the toilet though \u2013 whenever the door\u2019s open, you\u2019re in full view during full flow\n\n"

The work, originally scheduled to end in March 2008 in time for\nthe summer\u2019s exam period, now looks\nset to continue for the rest of the academic year.\nThe delay has been caused by the\nlatest in a series of technical setbacks\nbefalling the two-year project. In what\nhas been termed a \u201cprocurement issue\u201d by a senior member of College\u2019s\nBuilding Projects team who wishes to\nremain anonymous, the dimensions\nof the rooms, which will house the\nair conditioning units for the ground\nfloor, differ from the dimensions in the\noriginal plans. The air conditioning\nunits are built depending upon the size\nof the room they are being housed in\nand now their specifications need to be\nreconsidered, hence the delay.\nLibrary staff admit the delay will lead\nto \u201cunavoidable noise\u201d associated with\nthe building work. At times, this will be\na particular problem on the lower levels and near the stairwell where noise\nwill be funnelled to higher floors.\nThe Library is extending opening\nhours in an effort to provide additional\nquiet study time. The library will be\nopen 24/6 from Monday 3rd March,\nseveral weeks earlier than in previous\nyears.\nContractors have been given exam\ntimetables when noisy work is supposed to stop.\nStudents will be able to avoid the\nnoise by retreating to higher levels\nwhere work is not in progress. However, due to overheating, which caused\nlevels 4 and 5 to reach 30 degrees CelTotal cost: \u00a310.85m\nPhase 1 cost: \u00a34.6m, Phase 2 cost: \u00a36.25\nProject start date: Summer 2006\nOriginal Library opening date: March 2008\nRevised Library opening date: July 2008\nPhase 1a changes: Relocation of Humanities department to Sherfield\nBuilding, alterations to levels 4 and 5 ventilation system, new roof\nlights\nPhase 1b changes: Chiller on Sherfield roof and Service Tower to\nprovide cooling to the ground and third floors\nPhase 2 changes: Refurbishment of the entire Library ground floor\nplus extensions including a learning caf\u00e9, new IT Suite, group\nlearning area and quiet study area\nLibrary refurbishment at a glance\nsius last year, this is unlikely to be an\nattractive option.\nThe problem of cooling the higher\nlevels, where students have been described as \u201cvisibly sweating\u201d, has been\napparent since the beginning of the\nproject but will remain unresolved\nwhen the \u00a310.85m Library refurbishment finishes.\nIn 2007, plans for solar shading were\nblocked by Westminster City Council\nwhen nearby residents complained on\naesthetic grounds. The solar shading\nwould have reflected heat from the\ntop-levels of the library providing a\nmuch needed cooling system.\nDespite over \u00a310m being spent on the\nrefurbishment, including alterations to\nexisting infrastructure on levels 4 and\n5, no solution to the overheating has\nbeen offered since the collapse of the\nsolar-shading plan. The air conditioning units currently being installed will\nserve the ground floor only.\nThe senior College member who\nspoke to Felix admits that there is still a\nproblem with temperatures on the top\nfloors which \u201chave not been reduced to\nan acceptable level.\u201d\nAn independent mechanical and\nelectrical (M&E) consultancy has been\ncalled in to propose solutions and they\nare due to report to College in March\nbut work is unlikely to get underway\nany time soon.\nThe \u00a310.85m Library development\nproject began in 2006 and is made up\nof three stages. Stage 1a is now complete which included the Humanities\ndepartment moving to the Sherfield\nbuilding along with some alterations to\nthe Library\u2019s infrastructure. Stage 1b is\nongoing and includes the erection of a\nservice tower and chiller, which will air\ncondition level 3 and the ground floor.\nThe first phase comes in at \u00a34.6m.\nStage 2, which costs \u00a36.25m, is now\nscheduled to be completed by July\nand involves the refurbishment of the\nground floor.\n\u201cIt is disappointing for everyone that\nit is taking a little longer, but building\nwork doesn\u2019t always go to plan,\u201d said\nTrudy Breuss, the Library Redevelopment\u2019s Project Leader.\nMs Breuss insists that the finished\nproduct will be worth it and the students can expect a larger and vastly\nimproved work space.\nThe ground floor area, which used\nto house Waterstones and the Science\nMuseum Library, has been extended\ninto the old walkway, to create a space\nnow totalling 2,600 square metres.\nNew additions will include a learning\ncaf\u00e9 at the front of the building, which\nwill be equipped with PCs and will\nserve hot and cold snacks providing an\narea where students can eat, drink and\nstudy at the same time.\nThe north side of the Library, where\nthe Haldane Collection used to be, will\nbecome the Wolfson IT Learning Suite.\nThe centre of the Suite will be an open\nplan area housing 50 new PCs funded\nby the Wolfson Foundation. The area\nwill be a quieter place where individuals can go to study by themselves, or\nto relax in peace on sofas which will\ncome equipped with built-in network\nand power slots. A few rooms containing projectors will be made available\nto students so they can practice group\npresentations.\nIn the vibrantly coloured \u201cgroup\nwork\u201d section, moveable metal screens\nand desks will provide an adaptable\nworking space.

    "content": "28 felix Friday 18 January 2008\nThe CES 2008 tech roundup\nSamir Talwar and Andrew Slater will let you know the good, bad and ugly of CES\nJ\nanuary is a good month for geeks,\nand last week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES \u201808) in Las\nVegas proves why. This is the\ntime where manufacturers get to\nshow off the next year\u2019s worth of gorgeous gadgets for you to get ready to\nblow some of that hard-earned cash\non \u2013 don\u2019t forget to thank the Student\nLoans Company for helping you out\nthere. It\u2019s not just computer stuff, ei-ther: in fact, the focus this year was on\nbigger, better and thinner TVs. That\u2019s\nnot all, of course: we\u2019ve got everything\nfrom radio to robots lurking within the\nnext few paragraphs. Read on, and try\nnot to pass out with pleasure.\nFirst things first: the beginning of the\nend for the long-running format war\nmay be near, with first Warner Bros.\nand now possibly Universal jumping ship and switching exclusively to\nBlu-Ray over HD-DVD movies. Even\nMicrosoft, a staunch HD-DVD sup-porter, has jumped on the bandwagon\nand hinted they might be releasing a\nBlu-Ray drive for their Xbox 360. Of\ncourse, this is all irrelevant, as faster\nand faster broadband speeds mean\nwe\u2019ll all be streaming beautiful HD\nmovies straight to our telly boxes by\nnext year if the industry gets its act\ntogether.\nSpeaking of the almighty soul-sucker,\nCES had a lot of them. Just about everyone important was invited, and they\nhad a lot of kit to show off. Panasonic\nhave made the biggest plasma screen\never, weighing in at 150 inches of pure\nviewing pleasure, and no one cared,\nbecause they didn\u2019t have anywhere to\nput it. Perhaps more useful is Pioneer\u2019s\nnew TV: at less than a centimetre\nthick, this one\u2019s prepared for true wall-mounting goodness.\nCompanies seem to be bored with\nplasma and LCD, and are searching\nfor more fancy acronyms to dazzle\nyou while they steal your credit card.\nMitsubishi have decided lasers are far\nbetter looking than mere LCDs... and\ny\u2019know what? They\u2019re right. Lasers deliver unparalleled colour vibrancy, enhancing your already fantastic viewing\nexperience \u2013 screw food, your new 50-inch flat screen was worth every penny\n\u2013 and making your favourite cartoons\nlook even more colourful than before.\nMeanwhile, Samsung have swung towards OLED, creating a 31-inch display that saps almost no power in comparison to the behemoth you have in\nyour parent\u2019s living room.\nAnd my personal favourite: LGPhilips\u2019 frickin\u2019 awesome e-paper tech-nology, which allows changing imagery\n(updates about ten times a minute, but\nthat should improve) on a flexible sur-face. It\u2019s backlit too, which while horrible for games and the like, is perfect for\nreading that book you always manage\nto leave on your pillow before setting\noff for uni.\nUSB, those three letters that we overlook every day, have a new member of\nthe family on the way. The standard\nthat freed us from the limitations of\nthe Serial port and provided us with\na single type of connector for almost\nany device has transformed the world\nof computer peripherals into a simple case of \u201cdoes your PC have a USB\nport?\u201d has released USB 3 upon us. By\nutilising the plastic block that prevents\nUSB devices being inserted incorrectly\nthey\u2019ve managed to sneak in a pair of\noptical connectors. This boosts USB\nup to a massive 4.8 Gbps \u2013 a ten-fold\nincrease \u2013 whilst letting you use your\narchaic printer and old-school iPod\nwithout worrying about slowing up\nyour new Blu-Ray reader/burner/\ntoaster.\nBy now, the weak will have drifted\noff in pursuit of less gadget-oriented\narticles, assuming that a university of\nscience has anything else to talk about.\nNevertheless, they have been culled,\nand I shall reward the faithful with\nC\nongratulations on successfully obtaining a copy\nof this week\u2019s umbrella.\nDon\u2019t despair \u2013 it may\nseem less than useful, but\nwith the right application of origami\nprinciples, it may just serve.\nThis is the first editorial I\u2019ve written\nso bear with me as I summarize what\nwent on this week and what articles we\nhave for you to enjoy; or skim over -you ingrates.\nTwo massive events took place in the\ngadget world with a whole host of toys\nthat we could preview. In fact we were\nso spoilt for choice that we decided to\ndo two big articles covering each of the\ntwo events and then give you a little\nrun down of the stuff we missed.\nThe first event is the annual Consumer Electronics Show, held in Las\nVegas, which is where all the technology manufacturers show off what their\ninvestors have put millions of their\nhard earned dollars into. The spectrum of cutting-edge stuff is as wide\nas ever; covering new technology in\nlaptops, television, audio equipment,\nrobotics and practically anything you\ncould dream of. Samir and Andrew\nhave teamed up to cover some of the\nprincipal releases from the show.\nNow the second event of the week\nwas the fabled Macworld where Steve\nJobs stepped up with yet another black\npolo neck shirt and a keynote speech\nfull of goodies for all the Mac fanboys\nand -girls. Will there be another major\nproduct? Who knows, but I\u2019ve covered\nas much I can of his content-packed\nspeech.\nOn a slightly less important note,\nSony announced that the production\ncost of a PS3 has halved since release,\nso who knows; we may get lucky and\nsee another price drop or a new 80GB+\nmodel appear at a reasonable price.\nMaybe I should nip down to town and\ntrade my elite in for a PS3? Life forces\nsuch hard decisions on us.\nDoesn\u2019t sound like a bad start to a\nnew year \u2013 it\u2019s just a shame Christmas\nhas gone, to be honest. We should start\nto see all of these new products seep\ninto the public domain over the next\nsix months so we can then cover them\nfrom a much more accurate prospec-tive, rather than all this guesswork all\nbut the most prestigious of us have\nbeen attempting.\nIn the works for the next issue we\nhope to have a big collection of reviews\non some of the top-end mobile phones\nmany people are sporting these days\n\u2013 and no, it won\u2019t just be an iPhone\nreview. All I now have to do is track\ndown a bunch of very specific expensive phones, in a building full of people\nliving on student loans \u2013 it should be\ninteresting, to say the least.\nIf you would like to get involved with\nputting together articles for this section then use the email address at the\ntop of this page and they will, hope-fully, get sent to the right place.\nSo without any more waffle I\u2019ll let you\nread about whatever breakthroughs\nfrom CES that Samir and Andrew have\nchosen to let you know about, or you\ncan skip it and read my fantastically\nfact-filled Apple article.\nP.S. No one\u2019s reading this far anyway.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\nI hate to pose this question, but do consumers really need a 150\u201d television?\neveryone\u2019s favourite electronic play-thing: robots.\nWith countless booths dedicated to\nthem, CES was packed with the first\nwave of our eventual overlords. And\nwhile they\u2019re not at the level of Skynet,\nthe displays of artificial intelligence in\nalmost all of them was astounding \u2013\nclearly, AI isn\u2019t just a pipe dream.\nFirst off is iRobiQ, which does...\neverything. Well, not the chores, but\nit\u2019ll take care of you, monitoring your\nhealth, your home while you\u2019re away,\nthe weather, your interests, and even\nthe news. It\u2019s fully customisable, with\na monthly plan that lets you sign up\nfor just the services you want. Add\nthis to a Roomba hoover bot and have\nthe pizza guy on speed-dial and you\u2019ll\nnever have to get up again... except to\nplay with your new Comprehensive\nRobot. Built of Lego components by\nyour overworked fingers, it does pretty\nmuch everything you\u2019d expect an overpriced toy to do: talk nonsensically,\nwander the halls, acting as a hazard for\nsmall children, and pretend to sympa-thise with your lack of cash following\nits purchase \u2013 it\u2019s a steal at only $869!\nOf course, if you want to go all-out,\nthere\u2019s always Sunny, NOAA\u2019s weather\nbot. He sings, he dances (that one\u2019s a\nlie... but the previous one isn\u2019t) and he\nknows a lot about the weather. What\u2019s\nimpressive, assuming what we saw was\nall autonomous and there was no man\nbehind the curtain, was the responsiveness and coherency of the artificial intelligence powering the bot. Replies to\nquestions felt natural and usually delivered the right answer, with a bit more\nthrown in for good measure. There\nwere a couple of slips, but the imperfections imply it\u2019s actually processing\nthe conversation itself, rather than the\nhidden human.\nI know it seems like it, but CES isn\u2019t\nall big technology \u2013 there\u2019s actually\nsome very simple ideas demoed there\ntoo. For example, the Slacker Personal\nRadio \u2013 a portable music player that\nhelps you discover new talent by simply letting you vote on songs, and then\nrecommending you new ones based\non your tastes. This is similar to the\nPandora music service, which provides\nthe same service through your web\nbrowser. Unfortunately, both of these\nare available only to our friends across\nthe pond, most Stateside companies\ncan\u2019t be bothered to branch out to un-civilised realms such as our beloved\nUnited Kingdom. Perhaps it\u2019s best\nwe\u2019re not the same as our American\nbrothers, however. Gizmodo proved\nthis when they decided to get one of\ntheir reporters a lifetime ban using a\nsimple device known as TV-B-Gone,\nwhich unsurprisingly is rather good at\nturning off TVs. As TVs were arguably\nthe highlight of the entire event, booth\nowners were unsurprisingly irritated,\nand while some took it in stride, others\ndidn\u2019t see the funny side. It could be argued it was all in good taste if it wasn\u2019t\nfor them switching off the big screen\nduring presentations, disrupting the\nevent and wasting everyone\u2019s time.\nPranks are awesome...when they\u2019re\nwell thought out.\nThankfully, the rest of the entire five-day tech-fest went off without a hitch.\nToo many gadgets, gizmos and gorgeous booth-babes to count resulted in\nenormous amounts of drool from the\nmouths of thousands of nerds, scattering the floor and causing an immense\namount of work for the clean-up team.\nApparently, that\u2019s all part of the fun\nthat is CES.\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nReveal yourself\nI\nf I were to make a premature\ncomment on the nature of 2008,\nI\u2019d say that it was a year in which\npeople and groups would reveal\ntheir true colours. The first 19\ndays of 2008, the year of the potato,\nhave yielded much evidence to support\nmy assertion.\nIn politics we\u2019ve seen some startling\ninsights behind the curtain of lies that\nshield all politicians. The Conservatives have unveiled new plans to end\nthe benefits culture by forcing people\nto work for their benefits. David Cameron summarised by saying \u201cWhere is\nthe dignity in sitting at home, dependent on the state, not having a job?\u201d Apparently he had wanted to say \u201cI\u2019ve got\nplenty of jobs on my estate for them,\nlet the plebs cut my grass if they are\ntoo stupid to get a real job. God I love\nThatcher\u201d but his PR advisor had advised him against it. After portraying\nthemselves as normal people via David\nCameron, the conservatives have finally revealed that they are cold, heartless\nchampions of Satan. Which wouldn\u2019t\nbe so bad if this proposal was absurd;\nunfortunately it\u2019s very sensible. I really\nSamuel Black\nhate when the Tories have good ideas\nas it makes it more difficult to loath\nthem.\nAcross the Channel, and indeed the\nAtlantic, politicians are also revealing\nwhat\u2019s beneath their dignified exterior.\nHillary Clinton showed us her soft side\nby breaking down in tears before the\nNew Hampshire presidential primary.\nThis quashed reports that she could\nmake an onion cry and certainly helped\nher to victory in New Hampshire.\nHowever there are lingering rumors\nthat the tears were false due to reports\nthat extensive plumbing could be seen\nbehind her head. The French presi-dent, Nicolas Sarkozy has also shown\nus that he is a real person when he\u2019s not\ngoverning. Indeed it would seem that\nhe is going to great lengths to show\nthat he spends most of his time being\na real person, and very little time running the country. He has recently been\ncourting, getting engaged to and reportedly impregnating ex-supermodel\nCarla Bruni (although not necessarily\nin that order). Sarkozy has shown us\nthat he is more interested in getting his\nleg over than pushing through difficult\neconomic reform \u2013 insert humorous\ngeneralization about the French.\nEnvironmentalists have shown themselves to be opposed to nuclear power.\nGovernment plans to go ahead with a\nnew generation of power plants have\nbeen met with opposition amid claims\nthat they will simply create more problems for the future. Environmentalists\nhave also opposed government plans\nfor offshore and on-shore wind farms,\nand have been resolutely against attempts to use tidal energy. Strangely\nenough, environmentalists have opposed all attempts to create clean ener-gy. Time was, green activists could happily oppose all and any destruction of\nthe environment but now that climate\nchange is an issue, they are forced to\nchoose the lesser of two evils. Instead,\nthey choose to remain opposed to everything and thus reveal themselves as\ncomplete and utter morons.\nYou, the people, have also shown\nsome questionable aspects of your-selves. The obsessively-documented\nand overly-reported fall and fall and\nfall and fall of Ms Britney Spears has\nbeen watched with voyeuristic enthusiasm by the public. Peter Preston\ncommented in the Guardian: \u201cwe are,\nin our way, that howling mob around\nthe arena\u201d. As he put it so well, mental illness has become a new spectator\nsport. It would seem that you pick up\nstories of Britney\u2019s destruction with\nglee; the quiet joy of knowing that\nsomebody far more beautiful, talented\nand successful is a wreck remaining\ntoo addictive to pass by.\nOne member of the public, however,\ncannot be faulted. Azfarul Islam, the\nFelix games editor, could speak badly\nabout Will Smith and I still wouldn\u2019t\nbe mad at him. Last week\u2019s delightful\ngames section has sparked rumours\nthat Azfarul Islam is going to get his\nown supplement in Felix, a Nobel Prize\nfor awesomeness and take over the\nworld. Az has revealed himself to be\nthe best sub-editor currently at Felix.\nI\u2019d now like to take this opportunity\nto reveal something about myself. No\nnot my real name, rather my ambitions\nto become ruler of all mankind. I think\nI shall take the title \u201cThe Emperor\nBlack\u201d. Does anyone have a problem\nwith that?\nThe age-old art of Expletion\nI\nhave serious problems with\nswearing. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nnow; I have no objection to\nthe profanity, I can live with\nthe associated disrespect and I\ncan even handle the fact that I\u2019m not\nvery good at doing it myself. What really bothers me about it is the lack of\nthought and originality that seems to\ngo into it.\nSwearing is one of the purest and\nmost natural forms of artistic expres-sion. What raises literature above the\nlevel of trashy paperbacks and free\nnewspapers is the ability that great authors have to express grand emotion\nsuccinctly.\nWhat one most admires in painters\nand sculptors is the skill required to\ncreate feelings from brushstrokes and\nto carve sentiment out of stone. The\ncommunication of thoughts, passions,\ndesires and hatreds is what defines all\nArt, and is what forms the core of the\nage-old art of Expletion.\nCursing is nothing new. For as long\nas we\u2019ve had language there have been\nlinguistic taboos; words that were\nnever to be employed in daily conver-sation. Over the millennia, existing taboos have repeatedly broken down and\nbeen re-erected around other words. I\nmay quite easily be wrong, but I believe\nthat today\u2019s society contains fewer of\nthese taboos than have existed at any\ntime in recorded history. The easy accessibility of these words is in part to\nblame for the Dark Ages of Expletion\ninto which we have been plunged.\nEnglish is a language particularly\nblessed with monosyllabic profanities.\nOnce securely locked away like precious porcelain reserved for the most\nspecial of occasions, these are now\nconstantly in use. As a result, their\ntexture is tarnished, their effect faded\nand their exterior cracked and dirty. In\nshort, their sparkle is gone. It is a sad\nstatement about the value modern society places on the Arts when one considers that a handful of swear words\nis what passes for genuine Expletion\ntoday.\nShould an argument break out somewhere in the English-speaking world,\nyou can be sure of hearing the same\nwords being batted back and forth\nlike deflated tennis balls. Almost in-stinctively, people\u2019s reactions tend to\ninvolve asterisks and bleeps. Where\nhas the invention gone? The original-ity, the thought? When will the sparkle\nreturn to our swearing?\nAs with almost every aspect of the\nEnglish language, Shakespeare is the\nundisputed master of the curse. Granted, his language is filled with the com-mon-or-garden variety of obscenities,\nbut the heights he occasionally scales\nare unparalleled.\nHow incredibly satisfying it must\nbe to be able to refer to someone as\na \u201cwhoreson, obscene, greasy tallowcatch\u201d or instead, a \u201cloggerheaded\ntardy-gaited puttock.\u201d Their meaning\nalmost takes second place to rhythm\nand pacing as the true conveyors of\nemotion.\nAll the fury and disdain that anyone\ncan possibly feel can be transmitted in\nphrases that require just the slightest\namount of thought and sentence plan-ning. Instead of instinctively reaching\nfor the old favourites, why don\u2019t we\nmake an effort to be more original and\ncreative?\nLet us raise Expletion to the pedestal where it once stood; as an art-form\nthat required intelligence, care, rhythm\nand inventiveness. You loggerheaded\ntardy-gaited puttocks.\nWilliam Shakespeare truly had a way with words: \u2018Why, thou clay-brained guts; thou knotty pated fool;\nthou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-catch\u2019, Henry IV Part 1. Not one use of the f-word\nGilead Amit\n\u201c\nShould an\nargument break\nout somewhere\nin the Englishspeaking\nworld, almost\ninstinctively,\npeople\u2019s\nreactions tend to\ninvolve asterisks\nand bleeps\n8 felix Friday 18 January 2008\n\n"

Seriously, it makes the\nlong hours and hard (but fun) work really worth it in the end!\nThis week starts... erm... ends off\nrather gently with a simple two-page\nspread. However, what\u2019s important\nhere is the introduction of a new section and the revamping of an old one.\nI\u2019m somewhat happy to announce\n\u2018P\u00e2t\u00e9\u2019. The concept is to offer some nice\nfilling, food-for-thought every once\nin a while. We will attempt to bring\nforward a news story or event that\nshould matter to gamers everywhere,\nand perhaps, even be of importance to\nnon-gamers. This first issue is a good\nexample of such. Between Sebb, Samir\n(our newcomer and stalwart Felix\nGames writer) and I, the controversial\n\u201cJeff Gerstmann / GameSpot / Eidos\u201d\noccurence is discussed from a variety\nof angles. Beyond the gaming connotations lies perhaps whispers of the state\nof journalism in consumer media over-all. Or not. Who knows? Whatever the\ncase, we\u2019re here to offer our thoughts.\nPreviously, Felix Games would run\nthe occasional review or two on flash-based, free games online that represented a number of impressive and\ndownright awesome independent (in-die) efforts. This time, I\u2019ve decided to\npromote it to its own section called\n\u2018Byte\u2019. Any puns are well and fully in-tended, you silly apples. We hope that\nit\u2019s going to be a regular column that\nyou\u2019ll enjoy skimming through when\ncan\u2019t find anything useful to do on the\nInternets. And no, research for coursework doesn\u2019t count.\nIt\u2019s quite hard to find new games at\nthis time of the year that are actually\nworth playing. With the sheer magnitude of quality brought forth during the\nholiday season, it\u2019s not hard to imagine\nsuch. However, this is an excellent opportunity to look beyond the mainstream and start sifting through the\nniche. There\u2019s more gratification and\ngenuine enjoyment to be found than\nyou\u2019ll ever realise. Browsing around\nthe PlayStation Network made me trip\nover the log that was the Burnout Paradise demo and have my fall broken by a\nlittle title called Super Puzzle Fighter II\nTurbo HD Remix. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\nThe Burnout demo was pretty fun but\ndamn, this little puzzle game was just\npure saccharine joy and should be\ncoined a Class A Illegal (and Addicting)\nSubstance. It\u2019s pure awesomesauce.\nOf course, the only way to partake in\nwhat makes playing it so fun is to do so\nin the head-to-head versus mode. You\nwill shout. You will yell. You will swear.\nAnd you will have that competitive\nstreak run rampant, I say! Like I said:\npure, unadulterated awesomesauce.\nOkay, so not everyone may like it as\nmuch as I do, but I do implore you to\ntry it out because you will hopefully\nnot regret it!\nAnyhoo, once again we welcome all\nto write to games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nHave a great weekend!\nThis\nWeek\nTo click or not to click?\nFight, honourable gamer-san!\nThe debate burns on Elementary shapes, mmm\nP\u00e2t\u00e9: The story of dead men\nFelix Games debates the morals of gaming journalism as the truth shines harshly\nA\nzfarul \u201cAz\u201d Islam says:\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re doing a good job some-times. Gaming is a pretty\ninvolving, passionate pastime and no\nmatter how much you promise yourself that you\u2019re going to be as unbiased\nand impartial as possible, you know\nit\u2019s not gonna happen. But hey, there\u2019s\nnothing wrong in embracing opinion\nbecause well-structured, justified sentiment adds not only personality but\nspicy variety to the mix.\nOr so thought a Mr Jeff Gerstmann.\nHis rather tactless relief of duties as\nGameSpot\u2019s Editorial Director came as\na random bit of shock. How? Why?\nWell, a common (and for all matters,\ntruthful) assumption is that game publishers have everything to gain when\nany reputable gaming authority establishes a high review score for their\nproduct. It\u2019s one of those brain-dead,\napples-to-apples (except they\u2019re really\noranges) juxtapositions that one can\nuse to gauge the perceived \u201cvalue\u201d of a\ngame. As a result, it is quite prudent to\nsee that they continually receive these\nhigh scores. Simply making games better doesn\u2019t seem to be the option.\nJeff had undertaken the review of Eidos\u2019 Kane and Lynch and had deemed\nit a rather average game, mandating it\na Fair rating. Fair enough.\nNot so, thought Eidos who had been\nSebastian \u201cSebb\u201d Nordgren says:\nReviewing is a tricky business. And I\ndon't just mean the drudging through\nterrible games in time for a deadline,\nor trying to write 500 words on a game\nthat is so mediocre it barely deserves\n20. When you're doing it for a liv-ing, there's also the problem of trying\nto make sure that the review copies\nkeep flowing, while maintaining fair\nobjectivity.\nWebsites also suffer from shoestring\nbudgets, which makes compromising\njournalistic integrity for a big advertising deal seem all the more attrac-tive. This, allegedly, is what happened\nwhen GameSpot fired Jeff Gerstmann\nfor, allegedly, reviewing Kane & Lynch\nlower than Eidos would have wanted.\nAllegedly.\nThe wider problem is that this is the\nfirst situation of its kind where it's (al-legedly) possible to link an honest review score to serious consequences for\nthe reviewer.\nIn a fledgling industry like games\njournalism, an action such as this going unpunished signals to other media\noutlets and, indeed, publishers that\nthis type of thing is acceptable.This\nis worse than just fudging the review\nscore into the low 70s for every abysmal game that EA releases. It's a worrying worst-case scenario: the end of\nhonesty in reviews and the beginning\nof corporate rule.\nThankfully, the extent to which the\nevent has been publicised has made it\nalmost impossible for anyone to miss\nand has probably harmed GameSpot's\nmargins more than they ever would\nhave thought.\nEven if this is, as GameSpot claims,\njust a case of bad timing, their refusal\nto comment honestly on the events\nthat lead up to Gerstmann's removal\nas editor-in-chief has stirred up more\nthan a couple of conspiracy theorists\n\u2013 making it the precedent to follow of\n2007.\nThe Internet has made sure that individual opinions have lost their value\nwhen compared to the aggregate, with\nsuccess being measured by meta-reviews. The fact that 100 honest 60s\nwill always outweigh one bought 90\nacts as a major deterrent to selling off\njournalistic integrity for short-term\ngain.\nplastering GameSpot with advertisements of the eponymous game. Presumably, many monies were involved.\nFair ratings mean that a lot of gamers may not buy the game since it\u2019s not\nGood enough. Many monies could be\nlost.\nYou see where I\u2019m getting?\nOf course his termination had nothing to do with Eidos, trills GameSpot.\nTo be Fair, it\u2019s not been solidly proven\nbut if anything, the timing, abrupt nature and consequences (fellow reviewer Alex Navarro took leave by himself)\nare just a wee bit too coincidental.\nSowhat\u2019stheoverallmoralhere?Publishers don\u2019t really like gaming journalists very much. I mean, sure they talk\nto them at times and definitely send\nthem a couple of games to get reviewed\n(only if they consider them worthy), but\nclearly there\u2019s this ingrained virulence.\nDue to the increasingly commercial\nnature of mainstream sites like IGN\n(owned by Fox) and GameSpot (owned\nby C|Net) are, more than ever, subject\nto the whims of publishers. Pervasive\nmarketing through the Internet is\nmore than valid: it\u2019s a significant part\nof any company\u2019s business plan. It\u2019s a\nplan that leaves little room for question and gaming journalists aren\u2019t in it\nif they\u2019re doing the questioning.\nAnd that\u2019s why you should all trust\nYahtzee\u2019s Zero Punctuation. He is,\nquite frankly, teh man.\u201d\nSamir \u201cOoblicious\u201d Talwar says:\nReporting on reporters... how very\nmeta. With my colleagues questioning\nthe integrity of the GameSpot man-agement, I thought I\u2019d do a different\ntake on the situation by analysing one\norganisation\u2019s response. You may have\nheard of them: it\u2019s a two-person team\nby the names of Gabe and Tycho, operating under a little-known brand called\nPenny Arcade.\nFor the three of you that don\u2019t know,\nPenny Arcade makes a very successful web-based comic strip of the same\nname which predominantly features\ngames. As they\u2019re so popular, they often get requests for advertisements,\nsimilarly to almost every gaming review site. The difference between them\nand sites like GameSpot is they insist\non reviewing the game first. If the\ngame isn\u2019t up to their standards, the\nads are refused.\nTwo weeks before the entire GameSpot debacle, Gabe issued this statement\nwith regards to Assassin\u2019s Creed:\n\u201c...we were huge fans of the first\nPrince of Persia game so when Ubi\ncame to us and wanted to run ads for\nthe second we said yes. We had no idea\nthey were going to completely fuck it\nover. So, from then on we started demanding playable copies of games\nbefore we'd agree to advertising. No\nmatter how early the build we tell the\npublishers that unless we can see it\nplayed in front of us or play it ourselves\nwe won't run ads for it.\u201d\nIt seems to me that this is the right\nway to go about things. As reviewers,\nyour customers trust you implicitly in\nyour endorsement or disdain for the\nproducts in your field. By implying you\nsupport a product without having tested it first, you are betraying that trust\nfor monetary gain. Penny Arcade take\nquite an extreme standpoint on this is-sue: Tycho states in a news post that\n\u201cGame Reviewers Are Wrong\u201d and\n\u201cThey Will Always Be Wrong\u201d \u2013 he believes the age of the game reviewer is\nnow over. I see it differently: the age of\nconsumer ignorance is now over. Corporations can\u2019t get away with this stuff\nany more, and it\u2019s about damn time.\nAny which way you swing it, the only\nway to recover from this honourably\nwould be for the executives responsible to fall on their Wiimotes.\nEidos\u2019 men in suits find out about Jeff Gerstmann\u2019s review Mr Gerstmann needs to upgrade his shield \u2013 those guns look nasty\n\n"

You must therefore resort to trying to make statements in such a way\nthat they appear blindingly obvious (so\nmuch so that your audience must have\nbeen idiots not to know their veracity\nin the first place.)\nThis became painfully clear watching\nJamie\u2019s Fowl Dinners last week. We see\nthe gormless oaf combining this technique with crashing around a studio\ngiving some birds a good cuttin\u2019 so that\nwe can watch similarly illogical women\nbursting into tears. One imagines that\naftergassingsomefluffychickstodeath\nthe hope is that we will be so emotionally churned up that we\u2019ll believe any-thing. \u2018How many fingers, Winston?\u2019\nHe follows this up by squishing his way\nthrough some mechanically reclaimed\nmeat leaving us to conclude, one im-agines, that because one can produce\nmeat of a squelching consistency by\nforcing chicken carcasses through a\nsmall hole that it must be disgusting\nand therefore that the whole chicken\nfarming process is questionable.\nThen the ever popular anthropomorphism fallacy kicks in and we\u2019re\nforced to conclude that because, one\nimagines, we wouldn\u2019t like to live in\na cage rammed up against our mates\nthen neither would a chicken. However alert readers will have noticed that\nduring the course of the programme\nJamie Oliver completely undermines\nhimself by pouring a can of tomatoes\ninto one of his dishes. And it\u2019s that\nwhich I would like to talk to you about\ntoday, dear reader.\nYou may not know this, but the life\nof a battery farmed tomato is not one\nof happiness and contentment. Take\nMick, a young green tomato. His fate\nhas already been written on the wall.\nHe will be grown along with millions\nof others just like him in a huge greenhouse at a density of 30 million to a\ncubic metre, meaning that he will be\nliterally pissing and shitting all over\nhis mates and being fed and watered\nthrough tubes called stems. He will\nnever see the light of day, rather being\nencouraged to grow at a rate of up to\nfive kilograms a day by use of genetically modified food and UV lamps. In\nfact the situation for Mick could be so\nbad that Mick ends up going mad and\ncannibalising his best friend Ahmed,\nthe tomato that he huddles up next to\nevery night.\nFive billion tomatoes die in this way\nevery second. In this environment\nMick cannot express any of his natural tendencies as a tomato. He can\u2019t\nmove about, peck straw bales or perch\non twigs. He doesn\u2019t even have a foot-ball. And what will happen to Mick if\nhe doesn\u2019t put on the required weight?\nWell, he\u2019ll end up in the gas chamber just like Mary, who wasn\u2019t quite\nred enough. Or like Dwaine, who had\nknobbly bits on him. He\u2019ll be pulped\ninto squelching passata and sold to\nHeinz for us to squeeze over our KFC.\nThere are even stories now of tomatoes being grown directly into a can. In\nonly two months time, unless the laws\nare changed, Emma, one of a seed runoff of the gas chamber will be grown\nstraight into pulp. I don\u2019t know about\nyou, but I can\u2019t imagine how the supermarkets can label Emma, this freak of\nnature, a tomato, but you the consumer\nwill never know her true fate.\nImagine you were a tomato. Is that\nthe kind of life you would want to\nlead? Not me. No, if I were a tomato, I\nwould rather live in a nice little mews\nsomewhere in Chelsea with lots of\nstraw bales and on a Friday evening, I\nwould pop out to Waitrose to pick up\na rotisserie of battery-farmed human\nand suck the carcass clean in front of\na television showing images of babies\nbeing gassed to death and fed to py-thons, laughing hysterically about how\nthe wheel is come full circle. Then, and\nonly then, would I be happy to call myself a Free-Range Tomato.\nThe hooty cream project\nS\no I said \u201c\u2026squirty cream\u2026\u201d\nand he said \u201cWho-ty cream?\u201d\nand I said, \u201cGenius!\u201d\nAlthough no rigorous design work has yet been com-pleted, preliminary testing has suggested that more design work is indeed\nrequired. Market research has also\nsuggested the product would be a complete failure in all markets but an inner sect of die hard nutcases, including\nmyself. The idea is simple. Take one air\nhorn and one can of that most amusing of \u2018food\u2019 products affectionately\nknown as squirty cream and, well, you\ncan see where this is going. Of course,\nthe easiest solution is simply to tape\nthe two together and create a nice big\nred button. Whilst this would certainly\nbe entertaining, it wouldn\u2019t quite produce the desired effect; if a significant\nR&D budget was available the cream\nitself should emit the \u2018hoot\u2019, and if possible continue to emit it for a considerable time after application, molecules\nof \u2018soundness\u2019 being trapped in the\nair in the cream and being gradually\nreleased. Not perturbed by thoughts\nof the necessary breakthroughs in science and technology required, and\nnever being one to give up on a stupid\nidea I ploughed ahead with a prototype\nregardless.\nThe hooter was removed from the\npackaging and attached to the top of\nthe cream, which conveniently and\nsomewhat bizarrely had an identical\nmounting flange. Pausing, with my\nfinger on the button, to wonder briefly\nwhether or not the cream would diffuse well through the hooter or if\nboundary layer separation would oc-cur, I shuddered at the effect mechanical engineering on a relatively innocent\nperson and pressed. Unfortunately science won again. Blooming science\u2026\nUpright the horn can be \u2018parped\u2019 at\nwill without discharging the cream,\nbut in \u2018cream-application-mode\u2019 ( i.e.\nupside-down) after a very brief suggestion of hoot the horn fills with cream\nand the effect is one of silent oozing.\nStill, I couldn\u2019t leave it at that, so after\ncleaning the horn I filled it with cream,\nattached the air canister and aimed at\nmy own face.\nCreamy and slightly deafening I think\nare the best words to describe the ex-perience. Still I remain convinced that\none day hooty cream will become a\nreality. The world will be humming\nthe ditty to the hooty cream advertising campaign and everyone will be\npersuaded that \u201ca little hoot with your\nfruit\u201d really is the only way to have a\nfruit salad. Football riots will never be\nquite the same. Imagine its use in care-homes, \u201cWould you like some cream\nwith that dear?\u201d The phrase \u2018with hilarious consequences\u2019 springs to mind.\nSo jelly and cheese on a stick had\nbetter watch out, because hooty cream\nis going to be well up there on the list\nof greatest party food ever. And whilst\nwe are on the subject, just what exactly\nis with food on sticks. I mean, food\non sticks, which genius came up with\nthat? \u201cI know, since everyone seems to\nbe so into cheese and all, lets put it on\na stick to make it more socially acceptable to eat just plain, unadulterated,\nunaccompanied cheese. And while we\nare at it lets put tiny sausages on sticks\ntoo\u201d. Behold the wonderful powers the\nhumble stick has to make things which\nwould be otherwise entirely stupid socially acceptable. Perhaps \u2013insert appropriate celebrity\u2013 ought to try it.\nThe Swiss on the other hand\u2026 Now\nthey know how to do food on a stick. A\ncouple of New Years back in the middle of a week of cruising through sweet\nfoot-deep powder and popping off\nrocks on a snowboard I had the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. Firstly\nyou get yourself a nice pointy stick of\nmanly dimensions, (that is, one with\nwhich you could probably slay a grizzly\naccidentally), attach yourself a properly\nproportioned sausage and roast it over\nan open fire. Boy, are they good washed\ndown with gluhwein, and if you can\nwatch base jumpers at the same time it\nmakes for a great evening. All the Swiss\nneed now to ring in the New Year in\nlike no other is hooty cream\u2026\nAddendum: It has recently come to\nmy attention that squirty cream developers have in fact been hard at work to\nbetter their product without my realising and it gave me considerable joy to\nSome good ol\u2019 hooty cream\n\u201c\nPausing, I\nwondered briefly\nif boundary\nlayer separation\nwould occur,\nI shuddered\nat the effect\nof mechanical\nengineering\non an innocent\nperson and\npressed\nJellybean\nDavid Stewart\ndiscover for the first time that squirty\ncream is now available in strawberry\nand chocolate flavours.\nA gormless Jamie Oliver\n\n"
