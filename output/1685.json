This\nweek Georgios Chatzitheoklitos shares more of their unforgettable experiences and the challenges they faced\nwhilst on the trip.\nGeorgios\nChatzitheoklitos\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\nDay One: Stage 1A\nO\nn the first day\nwe began early,\nwaking up at\n5:15am. Kindly\ndriven to our starting point\nin a small town named\nCalenzana by our host\nfrom the night before, we\nwere nervous but eager to\nset off. We were all very\nsilent during that drive,\ncontemplating what lay\nahead of us.\nSetting off at 6:45am,\nwe quickly climbed up,\nreaching our first peak at\n10am. Our spirits were\nhigh, and we thought we\nwere in for an easy day.\nBut with 1550 metres\nof ascent, the next part\nof the stage ramped up\nthe incline, and several\nsections of scrambling\nfollowed, with infrequent\nassistance from chains.\nUpon arriving at our\nsecond peak, the D\u2019Ortu\nDi U Piobbu refuge was in\nsight, and it proceeded to\ntaunt us for the next hour\nas we contoured our way\naround the edge of the\nvalley towards it. From\nthe distance, the refuge\nappeared to sit impossibly\non the mountainside \u2013 as\nthough perpetually sliding\ninto the valley far below.\nEverything we needed\nwas on offer. Once we\u2019d\nhad a bitingly cold shower\nfollowed by a hearty\ndinner of mushroom soup\nand lentils, we felt more\nthan ready to sleep. That\nis everyone except Harry,\nwho felt the need to stand\nvigilant, wearing nothing\nbut his underwear as the\nfreezing mountain air\nwashed over him. It was\nour first evening on the\ntrail, and we were treated\nto a stunning sunset, overlooking the small village\nwe\u2019d left behind earlier\nthat morning.\nDay Two: Stage 2B\nAfter a luxurious lie-in,\nwe awoke to the ringing\nof our alarms at 6:30am.\nAfter the girls had finally\ngot a grip on how to\ndisassemble their tent,\nand we had dealt with the\ncomplex task of hunting\ndown Georgios, whose\nporridge decided to take\nall morning to cook, we\nwere ready for the set-off,\nonly half an hour later\nthan planned. Having previously tackled a day of\nrelentless climbing, Max\nselected a low-level route\nfor day two not to exert\nourselves too much for\nthe gruelling days ahead.\nThe route wound its way\nthrough the forest to the\nvalley floor, where we\nwere to ford what we\u2019d\nread was a raging torrent.\nIt turned out to be a dry\nriver bed, with the trail\nhaving not seen rain in\nover four months.\nAfter lunch, we began\nthe climb up a stony\ntrail which frequently\nopened up onto ledges\nwith stunning views. The\n2712m of pure joy! // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nThe most beautiful team photo // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nFurther adventures on the toughest trail in Europe\nexcitement of crossing a\nrather bouncy suspension\nbridge was soon mitigated\nby a sudden and steep\nclimb over a bouldery path\nthrough the forest. After\nwe passed a seemingly\nendlessstreamofGermans\nas we were climbing the\nfinal hill, suddenly we\nsaw a helipad jutting off\nthe mountainside and,\nshortly after, the Refuge\nde Carozzu, our accommodation for the night.\nOn arrival to the refuge,\nwe proceeded to finish the\ncognac bottle Georgios\nhad been carrying\nwith him. One of the\nFrench hikers promptly\ncommented \u201cEuh, you\nEnglish people with your\ncognac\u2026\u201d Upon speaking\nto the other trekkers, we\nwere somewhat horrified\nto hear about a painful\njourney over the top of the\nmountain involving many\nchains and scrambles,\nand were relieved we\u2019d\nchosen the lower route on\nthis occasion.\nDay Three: Stage 3\nOn day three, the\nguardian of the refuge told\nus a storm was imminent\nand recommended that\nwe had a 6am start for\nthe hike to Ascu Stagnu.\nSo we packed up in the\ndark and set off with our\nhead-torches. The 5am\nalarms were worth it,\nas due to minimal light\npollution we could see the\nmost stars we had ever\nseen, and we caught a full\nmoon rising between the\npeaks we were about to\nclimb. The day involved\nsome technical climbs,\nand a large fraction of the\n860 metre ascent involved\nclimbing and scrambling\nas well as big rock slabs\nand chains that we used\nto hoist ourselves up. We\nmade good time on the\nway up, stopping only\nwhen we came across a\ncouple of British hikers\nwho told us excitedly that\nthere was signal where\nthey were stood. Glad\nfor a break, we took the\nopportunity to tell our\nfamilies all was well\nbefore plodding onwards\nto the top. Here, for the\nfirst time, we met a hiker\nwalking in the opposite\ndirection, from south to\nnorth, and eagerly asked\nhim how his legs were as\nhe was nearing the end\nof his GR20 experience.\nHis reply was rather\ndiscouraging: \u201cFucked,\nabsolutely fucked!\u201d\nThe descent was just as\nsteep, if not steeper, than\nthe ascent \u2013 hard on our\nknees and slow moving.\nBut with the entire day\nbeing only 6km in total,\nwe were at the refuge\nbefore midday and had\nall afternoon and evening\nto get to know our fellow\nhikers from all over\nEurope. The storm we\u2019d\nbeen warned about hit in\nthe evening, just as we\nwere heading to bed, so\nwe opted for a dry night in\na refuge dormitory.\nDay Four: Rest day\nWhen we woke up at\n5am, we were disappointed to discover that there\nwas another storm due\nand it wouldn\u2019t be wise to\nhike that day. Given that\nthis stage was the one in\nwhich seven hikers were\nkilled in a thunderstorm\nin 2015, we respected the\nmountains and stayed at\nAscu Stagnu for another\nday, resting our legs. A\nmilitary medical vehicle\narrived in the evening\nand, at first, we wondered\nwhether something had\nhappened to the small\ngroup of hikers that had\nignored the warnings and\nheaded out anyway. But\nshortly after about 80\nmilitary personnel poured\ninto the showers, which\ntremendously increased\nthe time it took the girls\nto brush their teeth. We\ndiscovered that they were\nBelgian paratroopers\nhiking in the Northern\nGR20 as part of their\nphysical training.\nDay Five: Stage 4\nWe were very disappointed to wake up to yet\nmore rain that morning\nbut, with a good forecast\nfor later, we set off at\n6am, getting an hour\u2019s\nhead start on the Belgian\nparatroopers. It was a very\nmiserable ascent: although\nwe thought the rain would\nstop fairly promptly, it\ntaunted us all the way up,\nmaking the rock slippery\nand harder to climb. Fog\ndescended, obscuring our\nview to only ten metres,\nand, at the maximum\nheight of 2607 metres,\nwe were cold and lost the\nfeeling in our hands, even\nwith all our layers on.\nAt times, we doubted\nwhether we should be\nhiking in these conditions\nbut just before 11am we\nreached the shoulder of\nMonte Cinto \u2013 the highest\npoint on the GR20 trail.\nWe sheltered from the\nwind for a quick break,\ndisappointed that the\nclouds were obscuring the\nbeautiful view that we\u2019d\nbeen promised. However,\nwe had a stroke of luck:\njust before we were about\nto start the descent, the\nclouds suddenly opened\nup, and the scenery was\neven more spectacular\nthan we\u2019d hoped! As the\nsun came out, Georgios,\nDiane, Carla, and Harry\ncouldn\u2019t help but be\ntempted to summit Monte\nCinto \u2013 not strictly a part\nof the GR20 trail but an\nadditional 2-hour excursion that our guidebook\nrecommended to reach the\nhighest peak in Corsica.\nof us left our bags and\ncontinued climbing up. It\nwas well worth the extra\nclimbing! The views from\nthe summit (2706m) were\ntruly spectacular, and we\ncouldn\u2019t help thinking\nthat this would be the best\nmoment of the expedition.\nWe left our mark on the\nsummit by signing the\nbook at the top as \u2018RSM\nminers 2017\u2019and shouting\nthe RSM chant at the tops\nof our voices. We were on\ntop of the world!\nBy the time we\u2019d\nre-joined the GR20 for\nthe descent, the Belgian\nparatroopers had caught\nup, but proved to be rather\nunimpressively slow and\ncaused traffic jams on\nthe otherwise quiet route\ndown. So much for them\nwalking around topless\nin camp and showing off\ntheir muscles, which made\nour boys feel insecure\u2026\nFurther adventures\nIn the next article:\nthe members split up,\nand the reason behind\nDiane\u2019s heavy rucksack is\nrevealed! So stay tuned.\nSignal in Corsica? Surely not\u2026 // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos Carla and Granite // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\n\u201cThe 5am\nalarms were\nworth it, as,\ndue to minimal\nlight, we could\nsee the most\nstars we had\never seen, and\nwe caught\na full moon\nrising between\nthe peaks we\nwere about to\nclimb\u201d\n\u201dWe had a\nstroke of luck:\njust before we\nwere about to\ndescend, the\nclouds opened\nup, and the\nscenery was\neven more\nspectacular\nthan we\u2019d\nhoped!\u201c\nWe left our\nmark on the\nsummit by\nsigning the\nbook at the\ntop as\u2018RSM\nminers 2017\u2019\nand shouting\nthe RSM chant\nat the tops of\nour voices. We\nwere on top of\nthe world!\nUnfortunately, Max\nwas too cold from the\nwet ascent, so he decided\nto start the descent to\nthe refuge whilst the rest\n\n"

He displayed\nlittle in the way of political artistry, however,\nand the tumultuous times\nhe lived in caused him to\npay with his life. Soon\nafter his decapitation, the\nhard-acquired objects of\npower and wealth in his\ncollection were dispersed\naround the continent.\nNow, more than three\ncenturies later, an ambitious project has reassembled one of the greatest\nart collections in history.\nWalking through rooms\nhung with enormous\ntapestries and painted\nmasterpieces \u2013 human\nachievements of powerful\nand marvellous beauty\nand detail \u2013 it is difficult\nto imagine that such\nvast riches were brought\ntogether under the possession of one man, and\nyet, they represent only a\nfraction of the collection.\nThe long-gone king\nhangs amongst his\nRaphaels, Mantegnas, and\nRembrandts, remembering the glorious years of\nhis ambitious past, but his\nbelief in his own infallibility is frozen in time by\nthe genius of Van Dyck.\n\u2018The Supper at\nEmmaus\u2019 by Titian is\nthe work which moved\nme most in the gallery.\nJesus has just revealed his\nidentity to two disciples\nafter his resurrection; he\nsits between them, half\nof his face in shadow,\nand his gaze goes out to\neternity. The body of the\nman on the left is thrown\nback in an expression\nof astonishment: the\nrealisation of his fellow\npilgrim\u2019s true identity hits\nhim with physical force\nand he is filled with awe.\nBut the man on the right\nis suddenly filled with\nthe instinct to venerate;\nalready his hands are\njoined in worship and his\neyes downcast, his own\nsense of self cast off by\nthe spiritual intensity of\nthe scene.\nThe most spectacular\nrooms are those which\nhost the monarch\u2019s family\nportraits, which are some\nof the most iconic of all\nBritish royalty. The royal\ncouple exchanging tokens\nside by side, Henrietta\nMaria dressed in the latest\nfashion of the day with\nher white hand rustling\nthe fabric of her dress; the\nrestrained attitudes of the\nroyal children in their silk\nand satin finery... There\nhistory breathes, and past\nsplendour awakens to\ndaze modern eyes.\nDukes and court ladies\nwho once sat for Holbein\nfind themselves exposed\nto the inquisitive looks of\nvisitors; the light that once\nshone in an eye, the curve\nof someone\u2019s nose or chin\n\u2013 the flesh that once was\n\u2013 is immortalised in two\ndimensions by a precise,\nalmost omniscient, stroke.\nIn the same darkly lit room\nare miniatures, equestrian\nstatuettes, precious me-dallions.\nElsewhere, the loose,\nswirling brush strokes of\nRubens and Gentileschi\ncast an atmosphere of\nbaroque sensuality into\nthe room. Enormous\ncanvases hang bursting\nwith flesh, draperies and\npearls, the vivid lustres of\nthe colours delighting in\nthe parting of anguished\nlips or in a lover\u2019s touch.\nThroughout his life\nCharles believed in the\ndivine right of kings.\nThis spiritual belief found\nexpression in magnificent displays by court\npainters such as Rubens\nand Mytens, which at\nthe same time served\nthe king\u2019s ambition of\ncreating an authoritarian,\nGod-like image of himself\nthat would be looked upon\nwith fearful respect. But it\nwas Van Dyck who served\nhis patron\u2019s image the\nbest out of all the others,\nand whose portraits say to\nyou: you are not worthy\nof the impassive eyes\nwhich gaze past you in\nassurance; the king is too\ncertain of the order of the\nworld, and of his place in\nit \u2013 an expression which is\nnot easy to forget.\nThe power of art as\na diplomatic weapon\nand the role it played in\nCharles\u2019 reign can be\nsee in representational\npaintings such as Rubens\u2019\n\u2018Landscape with St\nGeorge and the Dragon\u2019,\nwhere the features of St\nGeorgearenoneotherthan\nthose of King Charles, the\nsaviour of his people. The\npainting served to symbolically project Charles\u2019\nauthority and legitimacy\nthrough the chivalrous\nideals of virtue and\nmartial prowess, using\nthe allegory of St George\nslaying the dragon.\nThe exhibition contains\ngreat works by prestigious masters but what is\npredominantly striking\nis their historical allure\nseen through Charles\u2019\nreign, whose artistic\nlegacy remains to impress\nus today \u2013 all the more\nso through Van Dyck\u2019s\ndeeply psychological\nportraits that bring the\npersonality of the man so\nvividly to the present.\nOur writer is blown away by the power of the vast riches once owned by the 17th century monarch\nGet my good side, Van Dyck // Royal Collection Trust\nARTS\nPauline Ronnet\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Psychotherapies would instead\nbe delivered through a\ncentralised service, as part\nmust now follow through\nby supporting the UCU\nwith more than just kind\nwords, both by putting\npressure on College to\nresolve the dispute and in\nits communication with\nstudents on this issue.\u201d\nRoddy Slorach, a\nrepresentative of UCU\nwho spoke at the Council\nmeeting, told Felix \u201cI was\nvery pleased to be invited\nto speak on behalf of the\nUCU branch. I was made\nvery welcome, and was\nparticularly impressed\nby the recognition by all\nthose who contributed\nto the discussion that the\nUCU has been forced to\nICU supports UCU in upcoming strike over pensions\nresort to strike action due\nto the hard line taken by\nour employers.\u201d\n\u201cI emphasised how\nfar the pension changes\nwould impact on staff\nsecurity and living stand-ards, and that management informed the joint\ntrade unions that they\ncould afford to pay additional contributions, but\nhave chosen not to. We\nare immensely grateful to\nthe Union Council for so\noverwhelmingly agreeing\nto support us in out action,\nand hope that together\nwe can help ensure that\nmanagement reconsider,\navoiding the disruption\nfor which we agree they,\nand they alone, should be\nheld responsible.\u201d\nThe move from Council\ncomes in the same week a\nlarge number of staff from\nthe Department of Physics\nwrote to Professor James\nStirling, Provost of Imperial, expressing their \u201cprofound dismay at the way\nin which Imperial College\nis handling the proposed\nchanges to our pension\nscheme\u201d. The letter, which\nhas been signed by nearly\n80 staff members \u2013 over\nhalf the academic staff\nin the department \u2013 says\nthe changes are \u201ca very\nshabby reward for the\nhard-working academics\nwho have created the\nworld-class reputation\nImperial College currently enjoys.\u201d\nThe letter goes on\nto argue the proposed\nchanges would leave\nstaff worse off, and\nthat the changes are\n\u201cneither necessary nor\nwell-motivated.\u201d It urges\nmanagement to \u201cstand up\nfor the Imperial College\nstaff for whom you are\nresponsible.\u201d\nDr Michael McGarvey,\nPresident of Imperial\nCollege UCU, told Felix:\n\u201cImperial\u2019s management\nare telling students that\nmassive cuts to staff\npensions of up to 60% are\nessential. The reality is\nquite different. Independent analysis has shown\nthe basis for making these\ncuts is false.\u201d\nHe said \u201cany disruption\nto students lies squarely\nwith the senior management who could instruct\ntheir representatives to\nreturn to the negotiation.\nWe urge students to\nsupport the staff.\u201d\nIn a statement for\nFelix, Alex Chippy\nCompton, ICU President,\nsaid: \u201cUnion Council\nvoted overwhelmingly\nto support the position of\nUCU in their upcoming\nstrike, meaning ICU will\nbe writing to the Provost\nand making the case where\nwe can to encourage\nImperial, and universities\nacross the UK, to return to\nthe negotiating table.\u201d\n\u201cWhile we will do\nwhat we can to minimise\nthe impact on students,\nour elected student\nrepresentatives believe\nthe potential long-term\nimpact on quality of\nteaching and job security\nof academics is serious\nenough that the students\nshould support their lecturers as they take strike\naction on this issue.\u201d\nA College spokesperson told Felix: \" We\nappreciate students may\nhave concerns about potential disruption but the\nCollege will be open as\nusual and departments are\nworking hard to ensure\nthat teaching and assessment activities continue\nas normal.Any changes to\nschedules will be communicated by Departments.\nAdvice for students is\navailable online.\"\nNEWS\n(cont.)\nof the Improving Access\nto Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme.\nHowever the CCG is\nundergoing further consultation with practices\nand therapists, due to the\noutcry generated by the\ninitial proposal.\nICHC, which is located\nin Prince\u2019s Gardens, is one\nof a number of practices\nthat has raised concerns\nover the changes, which\nwere initially set to take\neffect in March. Under the\nnew system, ICHC could\nsee the amount of psychotherapy it can offer cut by\n60%. Students and staff,\nwho make up the majority\nof ICHC\u2019s patient cohort,\nalong with local residents,\nmay have to go elsewhere\nto access psychotherapy\nservices.\nUnder the new propos-als, ICHC would only be\nable to offer Cognitive\nBehavioural Therapy\n(CBT), and would have\nto cut the psychodynamic\ntherapy they offer \u2013 a loss\nof three days a week. This\nreduction would likely\nhave a knock-on effect on\nImperial\u2019s in-house counselling service, which\nhas been struggling with\nstudent demand over the\nlast few years.\nThe rationale from\nthe Clinical Commissioning Group is that the\nchange would improve\nborough-wide accessibility \u2013 since not all GP\nsurgeries currently offer\npsychotherapy sessions\n\u2013 and make it easier to\nassess treatment outcomes\nand ensure good clinical\ngovernance.\nHowever, clinicians at\nICHC have cited potential\nbarriers to accessibility,\nas patients may have to\ntravel further to reach their\nappointments. Concerns\nhave also been raised over\nthe potential impact that\nthe loss of psychotherapy\nservices will have on the\nmulti-disciplinary team\napproach offered by\nthe Health Centre. This\ncurrently enables them\nto support, in-house,\nmany of those with more\ncomplex mental health\nneeds.\nThis move comes as\npsychiatry services in the\nNHS are coming under\nincreasing pressure.\nThe number of patients\nseeking help for mental\nhealth problems like\neating disorders or substance abuse problems has\nhit a record high, while a\nlack of services has meant\nan increasing number of\npatients are having to get\nsectioned before they can\naccess treatment. A recent\nreport from the King\u2019s\nFund showed mental\nhealth budgets were expanding at a much slower\nrate than physical therapy\nservices, prompting concerns that patients were\nreceiving poorer quality\ncare as a result.\nPsychotherapy, a broad\nterm covering a range of\nnon-pharmaceutical ther-apies, is widely used as a\ntreatment for a number of\nmental health problems,\nincluding depression and\nanxiety. CBT is one of the\nmost well-known forms,\nbut other types include\npsychodynamic psychotherapy and Cognitive\nAnalytic Therapy (CAT).\nImperial College Health Centre could see its services cut // Imperial\nImperial psychotherapy services to be potentially cut\nFRIDAY, 16TH\nFEBRUARY, 2018 FELIX\nEDITORIAL\nThe Felix Team\nEditor-in-Chief\nFred Fyles\n\u2022\nDeputy Editor\nJoanna Wormald\n\u2022\nNews Editors\nJoanna Wormald\n\u2022\nPolitics Editors\nAvirup Banerjee\nDivyen Vanniasegaram\n\u2022\nComment Editors\nAlan Perfect\nCharlie Titmuss\n\u2022\nScience Editor\nRosie Dutt\n\u2022\nTech Editor\nTom Mrazek\n\u2022\nArts Editors\nIndira Mallik\nJJ Cheng\nAdam Gellatly\n\u2022\nBooks Editors\nJJ Cheng\nAlice Peberdy\n\u2022\nMusic Editors\nAndy Djaba\nAdrian LaMoury\nHenry Eshbaugh\n\u2022\nFilm Editors\nMikhail Demtchenko\nAshley Luckyram\nMark Aduol\nMichael Purdy\n\u2022\nTV Editor\nAndrew Melville\n\u2022\nGames Editor\nSaad Ahmed\n\u2022\nFood Editors\nAlice Davage\nAndrada Balmez\n\u2022\nTravel Editor\nEdita Pileckyte\n\u2022\nPuzzles Editor\nHamish Beck\n\u2022\nSports Editor\nImraj Singh\n\u2022\nHead Photographer\nJoseph O'Connell-Danes\n\u2022\nCopy Editors\nAlex Adler\nAsh Pattar\nAstrid Zong\nSelin Olenik\nRhidian Thomas\nEzgi Ozyilkan\nHari Choudhury\nMyles Lee\nCONTENTS\nEDITORIAL\nNEWS\nPOLITICS\nCOMMENT\nSCIENCE\nTECH\nARTS\nBOOKS\nFILM\nMUSIC\nTV\nGAMES\nFOOD\nTRAVEL\nHANGMAN\nPUZZLES\nSPORTS\n2\n3-5\n6-7\n8-11\n12-13\n14-15\n17-19\n23\n24\n25-27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32-33\n34\n37-40\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort\nRoad\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Mortons Media\nGroup, Boston Road,\nHorncastle, Lincolnshire\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2017\nOn standing together\nA\nfter six months,\nwe\u2019ve finally\ngot there: a\nUnion Council\nsession that was actually\nexciting! This week saw\nanother meeting of Union\nCouncil, which opened\nwith a long discussion\nabout the upcoming\nstrikes, which are set to\ntake place later this week.\nFor those of you not in\nthe know \u2013 obviously\nfirst-time readers of Felix\n\u2013 these strikes are the\nculmination of long-run-ning debates around\npension pay for university\nworkers.\nPreviously, most\npeople working at a university were guaranteed\na certain amount for their\npension fund. However,\nunder new plans from\nUniversities UK (UUK),\nwho cite unsustainable\ncosts, the scheme will\nbe changed. As a result,\nsome estimates state that\nworkers could lose up\nto 60% of their pension\nfund, and, as a result,\npeople have been up in\narms. The Universities\nand College Union (UCU)\nhave planned 14 days of\nstrike action, starting this\nweek, and then slowly escalating before a full week\nof strike action in March.\nThat\u2019s the summary\nversion. If you want to\nfind out more about it,\nthen I\u2019d recommend\nspeaking to some of your\nlecturers \u2013 I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll\nhave a lot to say about\nthe potential changes.\nBut what came out of\nthe discussion at Council\nwas a vote for the Union\nto officially support the\nstrikes. While acknowledging that the strikes\nwould cause disruption\n\u2013 what else would be the\npoint of them? \u2013 and that\nthis should be minimised\nas far as possible, Union\nrepresentatives will back\nthe UCU in discussions\nwith senior management.\nThere were a few important points raised in the\nCouncil session, which\nI\u2019ve been pondering\nover for a few days. One\nrepresentative said that\nhe didn\u2019t feel he could\nsupport something that\nwould cause disruption\nto the students we are\nsupposed to represent,\nand \u2013 while it\u2019s fair to\nfeel concerned about the\nimpact it could have on\nstudents \u2013 I think refusing\nto support the strikers\nwould cause much more\nof a disruption to all of\nour education. This debate\nis not about the next few\nweeks, or even about the\nnext few years; it\u2019s about\nthe long-term future of\nour education. How can\nwe expect to have lecturers who are motivated\nif they\u2019re worried about\nwhat\u2019s going to happen\nwhen they retire? How\nwill we attract the best\nand the brightest if we\ncan\u2019t guarantee them a\nfuture? When talking\nabout salaries in excess of\n\u00a3100k, the College always\nsay they are needed to get\nthe highest quality people\nin \u2013 why doesn\u2019t that\napply to everyone?\nWe\u2019re facing the thin\nend of a short wedge.

    "content": "ISSUE 1685\nFELIX\n19\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nP\nluto, in summary,\nis the most visually impressive\nplay you\u2019ve likely\nnever heard of. Before\nseeing the show, all I\nknew was that it involved\nAstro Boy, a character I\nvaguely recalled from my\nchildhood. What I now\nknow is that my interest\nin the ethical questions\nunderpinning artificial\nintelligence has grown\ntenfold.\nIn essence, Pluto\nis a sci-fi mystery: the\nworld\u2019s most powerful\nrobots are being\nmurdered, and a detective,\nwho happens to be a robot\nhimself, is attempting to\nsolve the case. The pro-duction, which is the culmination of seventy years\nof sci-fi history, explores\nthe question of what it is\nto be human.\nIn1951,OsamuTezuka,\na cartoonist working hard\non creating light-hearted\nyet meaningful comic\nstrips in post-war Japan,\ncreated the character of\nCaptain Atom (later to\nbecome just Atom, aka\nAstro Boy): a child-like\nrobot working for peace.\nIn 2003, Naoki Urusawa\nand Takashi Nagasaki\nworked together to write\na new manga, in honour\nof Atom\u2019s fictional birth\ndate, April the 7th 2003.\nThe story created was\nPluto, which is now\npassed on into the hands\nof director-choreographer\nSidi Larbi Cherkaoui.\nCherkaoui\u2019s background\nin dance and theatre blend\ntogether in Pluto \u2013 it is\nclearly the work of a mind\nskilled at using movement\nto represent thought,\nemotion, and time. One\nof the more striking uses\nof dance \u2013 and there are\nseveral to choose from\n\u2013 is the depiction of a\nrobot\u2019s inner process by\nthe actions of four or five\ndancers around it. When\nthe detective, Gesicht,\nacts out his usual morning\nroutine, dancers surrounding him convey his every\nthought with little gestures\nwhich, upon first glance,\nappear busy and over-whelming. Upon further\nglances, it becomes clear\nthat the impeccably timed\nhand movements signal\neach of Gesicht\u2019s thought\nprocesses as they happen.\nMany of the movements of the performers\nthroughout the show\nwere blink-and-you\u2019vemissed-it, but the one that\naffected me the most was\na simple movement of\nGesicht sitting on a chair\nand being pushed (by the\ndancers) through a white\nframe. The simple enough\nmovement was to signify\nhis leaving the dressing\nroom and entering the\ndining room where his\nwife awaited him. I only\ncaught the end of the swift\nand elegant movement,\nand was left with a strong\ndesire to press rewind to\nsee the action again. I had\nthe opportunity later in\nthe show when the same\naction was repeated but,\nas I was reading surtitles\nat the time, missed it once\nagain.\nWhich brings us on to\nthe defining feature of the\nshow: surtitles. Used at\ntimes synonymously with\nsubtitles, surtitles have\na similar meaning: the\ntranslation of the script\nis projected for the audience\u2019s benefit, but do not\ninclude the usual descriptions of sounds that would\nbe provided for deaf and\nhard of hearing audiences.\nPluto was performed\ncompletely in Japanese\nby the Bunkamura\nTheatre Cocoon, a theatre\ncompany based in Japan,\nwhich meant that the sur-titles were necessary, and\nindeed did become a part\nof the show. Rather than\nrestricting the surtitles to\nabove or below the action,\nthe surtitles were projected within the show itself,\nadding to the overall effect\nof an integrated manga\ncomic. The two-tiered\nstage design constantly\nchanged shape with the\naid of background dancers\nwho continuously moved\nwhite blocks and borders.\nThe surtitles were projected within the black\nspaces created and on the\nwhite borders and blocks,\nsometimes alongside\nmanga illustrations. The\nimpression intended on\nthe audience was that of\nreading a gigantic comic\nbook. And it worked.\nThe downside to sur-titles, as frequently is the\ncase with subtitles, is the\nopportunity for mistakes.\nOccasionally, the words\nwere displayed too early\nor too quickly for the\naudience to read but,\ngiven how infrequent the\nmistakes were and how\nmany were possible \u2013 the\nlocation of the projections\nchanged with every other\nsentence \u2013 the mistakes\nwere not bad enough to\nbe irritating. The only\nother problem of having\nto read a translation was\na general weakness of the\nplay altogether: the sheer\namount of action to watch\nwas, at times, a little too\nmuch. Yet, it is impossible\nnot to be in awe of how\nCherkaoui coordinated\nthe timing of everything.\nRobot puppeteers,\ndancers, and minor\ncharacters all worked\nseamlessly throughout the\nshow and it was startling\nto realise at the end that it\nwas a cast of fifteen, not\nfifty. Tao Tsuchiya should\nbe especially praised\nfor her performance as\nboth of the lead female\nroles, something I hadn\u2019t\nrealised until I noticed\none of her characters\nmissing from the curtain\ncall.\nTsuchiya and the rest\nof the Pluto cast were\nspectacular, and deserved\nfar more than a mere four\ndays in London. With any\nluck, they\u2019ll return to our\nshores again soon.\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 27TH\nOCTOBER, 2017 FELIX\n18\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPortraits of the Obamas unveiled in Washington\nO\nn Monday,\nportraits of\nthe former\nA m e r i c a n\nPresident Barack Obama,\nand the former First\nLady Michelle Obama\nwere unveiled at the\nNational Portrait Gallery\nin Washington DC. They\nwere painted by Kehinde\nWiley and Amy Sherald,\nwho were selected by the\nObamas after interviews\nat the White House; they\nare the first ever AfricanAmerican artists to paint\nthe presidential portraits.\nWiley has depicted\nObama sitting forward in\na carved wooden chair in\na dark, tie-less suit; he is\nfrowning, deep in thought.\nThe space around the\nformer president is richly\nverdant: glossy leaves\nlie against a dark field\namongst a scattering of\ndelicateblooms.Theback-ground recalls the finely\ndetailed illuminations on\nmedieval manuscripts.\nThe parallels with western\ncanon are no accident: the\n40 year-old New YorkBased artist Kehinde\nWiley is best known for\nhis large scale paintings\nof African-American\nsubjects, often found on\nthe streets of Harlem,\nin the roles of figures of\npower. In one painting for\nexample, a young black\nman is portrayed riding\na rearing horse, golden\ncape swirling around\nhim in a pose lifted from\nthe 19th\ncentury painting\nNapoleon Crossing the\nAlps by Jacques-Louis\nDavid.\nBefore the unveiling,\nBarack Obama joked that\nhe had to dissuade Wiley\nfrom painting him with\na crown, saying \u201cI had\nto explain that I\u2019ve got\nenough political problems\nwithout you making me\nlook like Napoleon!\u201d.\nFor a painting of the\nfirst black president, no\nmere allusion to power\nis needed, but there are\nlayers of meaning in\nWiley\u2019s portrait: the\nflowers around Obama\ndetail his heritage:\nAfrican blue lilies represent his Kenyan father,\nthe jasmine is for Hawaii\nwhere Obama grew up,\nand the chrysanthemum,\nthe official flower of\nChicago, honours the city\nwhere he met Michelle,\nand where his political\ncareer started.\nSherald\u2019spaintingofthe\nformer first lady depicts\nher against a periwinkle\nblue field in a white gown\nby the designer Michelle\nSmith. Michelle Obama\npraised Sherald\u2019s work\nand said she was thinking\nof the girls, particularly\nthe girls of colour, \u201cwho\nin years ahead will come\nto this place and... see an\nimage of someone who\nlooks like them hanging\non the wall of this great\nAmerican institution.\nAnd I know the kind of\nimpact that will have on\ntheir lives because I was\none of those girls, and\nwhen I think about those\nfuture generations and\ngenerations past, I think\nwow, what an incredible\njourney we are on together\nin this country.\u201d\nThe portraits of the\nObamas will remain on\ndisplay at the gallery,\nwhere the former president\u2019s likeness will join\nthe ranks of presidential\nportraits through the ages,\nincluding that of George\nWashington.\nA pared-down Carmen falls flat at the ROH\nB\narrie Kosky\u2019s\ntake on Bizet\u2019s\nm u c h - l o v e d\nOpera, Carmen,\nis a confused mash-up of\ngrand opera and spirited\nWest End musical. The\ndirector, known for his\nwacky, quirky produc-tions, in his pursuit of a\nbreak from convention\n\u2013 and in a bid to adopt a\nradically postmodern take\non the traditionally heady\nromance \u2013 discards the\nSpanish exoticism that\nforms an integral part of\nCarmen. What remains\nare brief glimpses of\nSeville \u2013 made apparent\nonly by Matador uniforms\nand Latin frocks in otherwise trite scenes. Even\nthen, the over-confident,\ncabaret-style exhibition\nfeels brash and tawdry.\nThe stage, consumed by\na wide staircase, with\nstunning lighting, appears\ngrand and alive. However,\nonce the initial glamour\nfades, the unchanging\nconcrete staging becomes\nheartless, dreary, and\nlacklustre. The audience\nis asked to imagine the\nfountain in the foreground\nand the bridge above the\nstairs, with no props on\nstage.\nCzech conductor, Jakub\nHrusa, well known for the\nhighly acclaimed adaptation of Carmen at Glyndebourne in 2015, makes his\nRoyal Opera debut. His\norchestra brings life and\nvigour to the edited score\nof Carmen. Nevertheless,\nhis brilliance can only\ncarry the production so\nfar. Towards the end of\nthe second act, there is\nless new music to keep\nthe audience engaged, and\nour attention regretfully\nreturns to the stage.\nAnna Goryachova\u2019s\nfull-bodiedmezzosoprano\nadds edge and a sense\nof danger to her sultry\nCarmen. First appearing\nin a pink toreador outfit,\nshe captures her audience\ninstantly. She exudes\nsensuality and passion,\nadding much needed\nstrokes of colour to the\notherwise soulless stage.\nDespite this, Goryachova\nand her co-star Franceso\nMeli, playing Don Jos\u00e9,\npresent an unconvincing\nrelationship sorely lacking\nin lust and sexual chemis-try. Kristina Mkhitaryan\ndazzles as Mica\u00ebla, Don\nJos\u00e9\u2019s other love interest,\nwith her flawless voice,\nalthough is occasionally\nan awkward presence on\nstage.\nThe last scene however,\nis refreshingly dramatic.\nCarmen\u2019s sumptuous\ngown, designed by Katrin\nLea Tag, juxtaposed with\nthe barren stage, is almost\niconic. Carmen and Don\nJos\u00e9 finally capture the\npassion missing earlier\nand although slightly pro-longed, the finale offers a\ntaste of what could have\nbeen a remarkable perfor-mance.\nAs a whole, the production is very stilted,\nwith an obvious lack of\ncoherency. A string of\nawkwardly transitioning\nscenes is brought together\nby on off-stage voice that\nnarrates large chunks\nof the narrative, leaving\nthe audience to fill in the\ngaps. Kosky\u2019s Carmen\nfalls short in almost all\nrespects, but those willing\nto sit through the dross\nare rewarded with some\nmoments of striking\ndirectorial and musical\ntalent.\nARTS\nIndira Malik\nArts Editor\nBarack Obama by Kehinde Wiley // Mark Gulezian/NPG\nKehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald are the first African-American artists selected to paint the presidential portraits\nPluto: a manga come to life\nA production that is a feast for the eyes explores artificial intelligence and what it means to be human\nARTS\nOlly Dove\nArts Writer\nWhere?

As an other\nexample, I found the bars\nof \u201cLondon Town\u201d to be\nover-emoted; a slightly\ncolder and more technically impressive flow would\nhook the listener more\neffectively, differentiate\nthe verse from the chorus,\nand have him come across\nas less cheesy. How much\ndo you need to play up a\nprolamation of love for\nthe Tate Britain?\nThen again, there are\nalways rough spots on\nthe first album. S-Jay has\npotential; I\u2019m looking\nforward to the sophomore\neffort.\nNew GoGo Penguin: A Humdrum Star is anything but\nM\na n c h e s -t e r - b a s e d\njazztronica\nband GoGo\nPenguin has made more\njazztronica. The group,\nnoted especially for\nprevious efforts Man\nMade Object and the\nMercury-nominated v2.0,\nhave continued to refine\ntheir unique sound on the\nlatest effort. Not too much\nchanges in the way of\ntone or songwriting; you\ncan expect to come across\nthe same break-beats and\narching piano harmonies\npresent on earlier works.\nAnd yet, the group feels\nfresh and progressive;\nnew rhythmic corners are\nexplored, new techniques\nare exploited, new tones\nare produced. And they all\nsound fantastic.\nThe group remains\nridiculously tight. The\ntrack \u201cTransient State\u201d\nshowcases their incredible\nability to cram into the\npocket as a group, melding\na dynamically-expressive\ndrumline with a heav-ily-syncopated double\nbass riff and stacks of\nglitchy keyboard chords\non top, weaving from idea\nto idea with an uncanny\nsharpness of purpose and\na next-level virtuosity.\nThe band pushes\nforward with strange new\nideas. \u201cStrid\u201d has some\nabsolutely wavy double\nbass harmonics at the\nend - the timbre of which\nis unreal. There\u2019s crunchy,\ncompressed piano on\n\u201cReactor\u201d that hits just the\nright spot. On the aforementioned \u201cTransient\nState\u201d, there\u2019s a break 4\nminutes or so in, where\nthe (fuzzed) bassline\ntakes up a single tone in a\npolyrhythmic fashion - it\nsounds like they\u2019ve drawn\ninfluence from fellow\nManchester act Tesseract\nin particular (new album\nout in April who up),\nand the whole djent\nmovement as a whole,\nwhich caught me quite by\nsurprise (djent\u2019s delicious,\ny\u2019all). Ideas and themes\nfrom traditional African\ndrumming to video game\nmusic are explored on this\nalbum, in great detail.\nBut there is a special\nkind of minimalism to\nGoGo Penguin compo-sitions, wherein each\ninstrument will pick up a\nrefrain and slowly nurture\nit, creating an intricate interplay between each band\nmember, and through\nminute variations builds\nincredibly dense harmony\nin the no-mans-land\nbetween the performers.\nInclined to be mercurial,\nglitches and breaks will\noften set a bandmember\noff, and the old refrain\nis ditched in favor of\nsomething newer, spicier,\nsharper. And so the band\npropels itself through\npiece after piece, stunning\nblock chords relenting\nto the pull of a driving\nbassline of squirrly drum\nfill, always coherent,\nalways with harmony as\nthe foremost goal.\nThenewalbumisafresh\nand welcome addition to\nthe GoGo Penguin dis-cography, complementing\nthe previous work with\nnew ideas and sounds that\ndo nothing but enhance\nthe band.

And if I can be\nquite frank, this album surpassed my expectations.\nBig-band jazz backings\nand honky-tonk piano\nfunk are the M.O. on\nthis tape; the samples are\nwell-picked and translate\nquite nicely to the rhythm\nsection. On top of these fat\nbeats comes the man, the\nmyth, the legend himself,\ndropping mad bars and\nflowing competently.\nThe production is\non-point throughout the\nLP. Suraj is well-mic\u2019d\nand the samples fit well\n(cop \u201cCaravan\u201d on track\n1). There are no glaring\nerrors; in general, the\nalbum (and S-Jay\u2019s Belfast\naccent) sound good.\nThe album gets close\nand personal, and quite\neffectively. Track 3 gives\na frank perspective of\nS-Jay\u2019s youth, identifying\nfaults in his younger self\nand earnestly analyzing\nthem from the perspective\nof his present (perhaps\nnewfound) maturity.\nThough perhaps lost\nin the verse, there is\na discernible sense of\npathos imparted by these\nfew well-executed bars.\nS-Jay executes enough\nwell to hook the listener\neffectively, showing off a\nbudding musicality with a\nneat bar here and a clever\nproduction trick there.\nThere are rough\npatches, though. While\nthe flows are generally\ngood, there\u2019s the occasional stray syllable,\ntrying to work its way\ninto the beat and missing.\nThough S-Jay covers\npretty nicely, they still\nfeel extra. In general, the\nflow (while competent)\nis not quite to the level of\ntechnicality that success\nin the rap game requires\n- a more precise control\nover the flow and the\nemoting alongside. To be\nhonest, S-Jay sounds a bit\nlike Will Smith, fostering\nan outlook that prioritizes\nidealist positivity over a\nmore ruminating perspective that interacts with\nhis character and actions\nin a more teleologically\nnuanced way. That is, he\nsounds cheesy sometimes.\nDon\u2019t take the steps there bub, it\u2019s dangerous. // S-Jay\nLeft my heart in Hackney, down in the Peach Pit\nA\nfter the release\nof their LP\nBeing So\nNormal, the\nVancouver-bred indie pop\nband Peach Pit embarked\non a European tour early\nthis year. With several\ndates around the country,\nthe glitzy nightspot in the\nheart of Hackney, Moth\nClub, was their London\npit stop of choice.\nOpening up for them was\na three-piece, Blackaby,\nrumoured to have performed live only once\nbefore their appearance\nas Peach Pit\u2019s supporting\nact. Fronted by William\nBlackaby, the band\u2019s\nhaunting, whispery, Elliot\nSmith-stained sound of\ntheir first hit track \u2018My\nPaula\u2019 transfixed the teen\ncrowd and induced a mass\nhipster head bob across\nthe entire venue. The set\ncontinued with \u2018Hairstyle\u2019\nand \u2018Pinky\u2019 (originally\ntitled \u2018Punky\u2019, before it\nwas inevitably autocor-rected in the lead singer\u2019s\nphone notes) being the\nprime crowd-pleasers.\nWhen the opening act\ncame to a close, each of\nthe Peach Pit members\nfiled out in quick succession and began to set\nup their equipment. A\nshort, profound, silence\npervaded the room as\nvocalist Neil Smith tuned\nthe final string on his\nguitar before kicking off\nthe show with the album\u2019s\nopening track \u2018Drop\nthe Guillotine\u2019. Written\nabout Smith\u2019s much better\nlooking high school best\nfriend metaphorically\nslitting his throat with a\nguillotine when stealing\nSmith\u2019s crushes, the track\nis characterised by soft,\nlazy vocals and intricate\nguitar licks, creating a\ntimeless retro pop sound\nwith a hint of classic rock.\nLike \u2018Drop the Guillotine\u2019, most tracks on the\nalbum revolve around\nteenage angst, the feeling\nof which was unintentionally intensified by the 80s\nprom d\u00e9cor on the Moth\nClub stage.\nThe self-titled infamous\ntrack \u2018Peach Pit\u2019followed,\nsending the crowd back\ninto trance which, ev-idently, only lifted on\nthe journey back home.\nThe chewed bubble-gum\npop sound, as the band\nput it, continued with\nthe lyrically blunt and\ngroovy \u2018Techno Show\u2019,\nGreek imagery infused\n\u2018Alrighty Aphrodite\u2019,\nmellow \u2018Tommy\u2019s Party\u2019\nand \u2018Private Presley\u2019,\nafter which everyone\ngrew withdrawn and\nintrospective. They closed\nthe show with a rendition\nof Chuck Berry\u2019s \u2018Johnny\nB. Goode\u2019 to reenergise\nand pump up the crowd.\nThe boys were so\ngenuine and down-to-earth, staying back after\nthe show to greet, have\na chat and take photos\nwith fans. From a failed\nattempt at crowd surfing\nby guitarist Christopher\nVanderkooy, to the conversation and kiss I shared\nwith bassist Peter Wilton,\nI had an unforgettable\ntime and I am excited to\nfollow all that Peach Pit\nhas in store.\nAn album from the entire London jazz community\nA\nwhole scene\ncaptured in a\nbrief moment,\nBrownswood\nRecordings\u2019 \u2018We Out\nHere\u2019 showcases the\nbest of London\u2019s young,\ngrowing jazz movement.\nCrossing the sounds of\nhip hop, jazz, neo soul,\nand afrobeat (and even\nslight acid house vibes on\nMoses Boyd\u2019s track), this\nalbum brings together a\ncarefully curated collection of diverse sounds,\nwith an underlying\n\u2018London-ness\u2019 inherent\nacross all of them. Within\nonly three days of record-ing, Shabaka Hutchings\n(musical director for the\nproject) was able to put\na spotlight on the musicians that are driving this\nscene, capturing perfectly\nthis pivotal time for the\nmusicians as artists.\nThe album opens\nwith a dark, melancholy\nrumble on piano joined\nby bass-clarinet and flute\nto form a harmonically\nempty, slow moving build\ninto a beautiful cacophony\nof horns and percussion,\nwith heavy, impacting\ncadences thrown in also.\nThis piece sets the tone for\nthe album; a mysterious\nintroduction to an eclectic\nyet harmonious collection\nof songs.\nThe next tune, \u2018Pure\nShade\u2019 by Ezra Collective, draws heavily\non afrobeat influence,\nalthough without the\nsame sort of anguish in its\nsound. Introduced by the\nmellow tone of the keys\nand soft-spoken voice of\nhorns, the song is set. The\nrich, modal harmonies of\nthe keys provide warmth\namongst the blue horn\nmelodies and persistent\ndroning bassline, all\nmoving independently.\nEverything is kept within\nthe delicate touch of the\ndrummer, who dictates the\nvibe of the song.

He\nhas heard the whole thing.\nIt is this impactful event\nthat drives forward the\nrest of Zvyagintsev\u2019s film,\nwhich serves as a precise\nand damning analysis of\nthe current state of Russia.\nZvyagintsev wields his\ncamera like a surgeon\u2019s\nknife, delicately lifting up\nthe thin skin of modern\nsociety and revealing\nthe darkness that festers\nunderneath.\nWhile Alexey\u2019s\npresence in the film is \u2013 by\nvirtue of the plot\u2019s design\n\u2013 limited, it is this image\nthat lingers throughout its\nduration. Shortly after the\nargument, Alexey goes\nmissing, last seen running\nfrom their Moscow apartment block on CCTV.\nThese tower blocks\nbreak up an undulating\nlandscape of trees and\nsnow, forming a liminal\nspace on the outskirts of\nMoscow. Zvyagintsev\nmanages to master the\npsychology of space, and\nthe use of architecture is\njust one tool in this brutal\nand harrowing account\nof both the divides\nbetween the parents, and\nthe hypocrisy of modern\nRussian culture.\nWhile in other films a\nmissing child might serve\nto bring couples together\nin mutual anguish, in\nLoveless, as the name\nsuggests, it only serves\nto drive more of a wedge\nbetween them. Boris,\nworking in a company\nwhose religious policy\nmeans everyone there\nis happily married, has\nalready moved on from\nZhenya, and has a heav-ily-pregnant girlfriend.\nZhenya, meanwhile, has\nalso taken on a lover, and\ncut herself off from her\nbattle-axe of a mother \u2013 a\nSoviet relic who lives\nalone off a highway to\nKiev, like someone you\nmight encounter in the\nwork of Svetlana Alexievich.\nJust as in Leviathan,\nZvyagintsev takes aim\nat Russian officialdom,\nwith the police inspector\nassigned to the case\nexplaining to Zhenya\nthat there\u2019s nothing much\nthey can do about missing\nchildren, when there are\nmurderers and rapists to\nworry about; instead, he\nrecommends she get in\ntouch with a volunteer\norganisation, who prove\nthemselves to be much\nmore effective than any\nofficial body, scrupulously\ncombing the surrounding\narea.\nubiquitous inclusion of\nsmartphones, for example,\nis \u2013 I guess \u2013 supposed to\nshow us the shallowness\nof modern life, but the\nextent to which Zvyagintsev hammers home his\npoint reduces the impact\nof the message.\nDespite this, Zvyagintsev\u2019s direction remains\nsublime, with his camera\nmoving consistently,\nalbeit glacially, through\ndoorways and around\ncorners; in one impressive\nlong-shot at the start of\nthe film, reminiscent\nof the unnerving work\nof Michael Haneke, we\nlinger outside a school as\nchildren run out, before\nthe lens picks out Alexey,\nfollowing him dutifully\ndown the street. When\nthe team are combing an\nabandoned Soviet-era\ncomplex near the apart-ment, the film becomes an\nexploration of the architecture of decay, no doubt\ninspired by the ruin porn\nphotographic movement.\nPointed remarks turn to\narguments turn to physical\nviolence, as the disparity\nand incompatibility of\nBoris and Zhenya comes\nto the fore. The couple\ngo from blaming each\nother for Alexey\u2019s disappearance to making a trip\nto the morgue to identify\nthe body of a child, but\nthroughout it all there\nremains an undercurrent\nof mutual resentment,\nnegating any possibility\nof a happy conclusion.\nLoveless\u2019 name sounds\nout like a warning: this is\nnot a film with a warming\nmessage, or a beating\nheart; it is a cold abyss of\na film, one that completely\ndrags you under, and traps\nyou in its power.\nFollowing on from the success of Leviathan, the Russian director returns with another masterful film in which a\nmissing child serves to highlight one couple\u2019s breakdown.\nLoveless is a chilling exploration of modern Russia // Altitude\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir: Andrey Zvyagintsev.\nScript: Olig Negin, Andrey\nZvyagintsev.

They need to take a long, hard look at themselves.\nCOMMENT\nDivest Imperial\nComment Writers\nI\nt was less than a\nyear ago that Divest\nImperial was formed,\nwith previous di-vestment campaigns at\nImperial having withered\naway and been forgotten.\nTen months on, our petition calling on College to\ndivest from fossil fuels has\nover 1700 signatures, and\nImperial College Union\nvoted overwhelmingly to\ndivest their own investment fund. The stage was\nset for a discussion with\nCollege itself \u2013 to present\nour arguments and learn\nwhy College remains\nreluctant to engage with\nthem \u2013 which took place\nlast month.\nIn meetings with\nprevious divestment\ncampaigns at Imperial\nmany years ago, the\nCollege claimed to prefer\nto engage with companies\nas shareholders than to\npublicly denounce their\nactions. Shareholder engagement seeks to change\ncompanies by voting at\nshareholder meetings: the\nmore shares you have, the\nmore your vote counts.\nIn the environmental\nmovement, it predates\ndivestment as a tactic by\ndecades, but has sadly met\nwith very limited success.\nWe were surprised that\nCollege chose to pursue\nthis strategy, and our\ninstincts proved correct:\nin an embarrassing\nclimb-down, Imperial has\nnow rejected shareholder\nactivism, saying that \u201cour\ninfluence is stronger as\none of the world\u2019s great\nresearch universities\nrather than a mid-sized\nendowment fund\u201d.\nSo what about divest-ment, then? A depressingly common misunderstanding of divestment\nis to expect that it will\nbankrupt fossil fuel companies overnight. It won\u2019t,\nand it isn\u2019t intended to:\nafter all, shares sold by\nImperial can just as easily\nbe bought by a third party.\ntheir reckless business\nmodels, standing shoulder\nto shoulder with countless\nother public institutions in\ndoing so.\nMoreover, given the\nfrightening scale of\nclimate change and the\nresearch going on here\nto mitigate it, is it even\nmorally right for a university like ours to be generating income from fossil\nfuel extraction? After all,\nwe already have a policy\npreventing direct investment in tobacco, and quite\nrightly too [Ed.: hardly\nwatertight]; perhaps\nCollege would care to\napply the same logic to\nother ethically questionable investments? Alas, it\nseems not. College were\nreticent to discuss tobacco\nat all, and (comparing the\ncases of tobacco and fossil\nfuels) said that they \u201cdid\nnot find them similar\u201d,\nthough refused to explain\nwhy.\nWith only a bit more\nprobing, the truth eventually emerged: College\n\u201cdoesn\u2019tthinkit\u2019simmoral\nto receive funds\u201d from\nthese companies, and,\nwhen pressed, revealed\nthat they believed giving\nmoney to fossil fuel companies was actually a net\npositive for the climate.\nThere we had it, at last \u2013\nnot that divestment was\nidealistic, or financially\nunfeasible, or any of the\nother diversionary arguments thrown our way\ninitially. At the heart of it,\nImperial College believe\nthat the best way to fight\nemissions from fossil\nfuels\u2026is with more fossil\nfuels. We look forward\nto College\u2019s imminent\nproposal to cure insomnia\nwith caffeine tablets, and\nto hearing how what the\nlibrary actually needed\nwas a few furnaces to\nreally cool it down.\nFossil fuel companies\nwant to do is to waste our\nown spare time on tactics\nthat don\u2019t work.\nWhat we heard from\nImperial was quite dif-ferent. Imperial College,\nhome of the Grantham\nInstitute and funder of\nworld-leading research in\nclimate science, believes\nthat we ought to be giving\nour money to fossil fuel\ncompanies because of\nclimate change, not in\nspite of it.Though at pains\nto stress that it really does\nbelieve in climate change,\nthe truth is that College is\nquite comfortable in the\ncompany of those that\ndon\u2019t, and ends up funding\nthe damn thing anyway.\nIf the choice is between\nan honest climate-denier\non the one hand, and\nCollege\u2019s contorted dou-blethink on the other\u2026\nwell, with a friend like\nthis, who needs enemies?\nSo much for smoke-free Imperial! // Flickr/CECAR\n\u201cCollege said\nthey believed\ngiving money\nto fossil fuel\ncompanies was\na net positive\nfor the climate\u201d\nwill not change voluntari-ly. No amount of publicity\nstunts or toothless pledges\nto trim carbon emissions\nwill change the fact that\nfossil fuel companies\nare there to extract and\nprocess fossil fuels. Any\nserious analysis of the\nfigures pledged by fossil\nfuel companies towards\nrenewable energy reveals\nthem for what they are:\ncynical marketing ploys,\nand nothing more. That\u2019s\nhow Shell, supposedly\nthe industry leader in\nsustainability (some\nachievement), can double\ntheir investments in clean\nenergy, while in the same\nbreath invest 5 times as\nmuch in risky deepwater\ndrilling for new reserves.\nDebates over tactics\nare one thing. Divestment\nseems to us to be the best\nand easiest way to effect\nchange in this area, but\nwe\u2019re open to other sug-gestions; the last thing we\nThe point is exactly what\nImperial recognised \u2013 if\nwe are serious about\nmaking a change, then\nour name and reputation\ncarries far more weight\nthan any amount of shares\nwe might own. When a\nuniversity with the clout\nthat Imperial has takes\na stance on something,\npeople and industry alike\npay attention; when 60\nother universities do the\nsame, it really begins to\nturn heads. Changing the\npublic\u2019s perceptions of\nfossil fuels is crucial if\nwe are to change their\nconsumption habits, and\ndivestment is one of the\nonly tactics that aims\nsquarely at that target.\nRemoving investments\nfrom fossil fuels is simply\nthe means; the end itself\nis to afford universities\na chance to call on fossil\nfuel companies to change\nThe state of the Union: to consult or not to\nconsult\u2026\nThe Union has a history of making changes without properly consulting with students. If it is\nsupposed to represent us, it needs to change.\nCOMMENT\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nComment Writer\nT\nhree weeks ago, a\nmotion to create a\nliberation officer\nto represent economically disadvantaged\nstudents was shot down\nat Union Council with a\n50/50 vote. The Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) spoke\nout vociferously against\nthe idea, arguing that \u201cit\nwas setting up a role to\nfail\u201d and \u201cthe relevant\nstudents haven\u2019t been\nconsulted\u201d. It was this last\npoint that I found ironic\ncoming from a senior\nUnion official. Time and\ntime again, those in power\nat the Union have shown\nthat they prefer to act first\nand worry about students\u2019\nconcerns later.\nThis is exemplified\nmost strongly by a report\nfrom the DPW to the\nTrusteeBoard(theUnion\u2019s\nmost senior committee),\nregarding the Wellbeing\nRepresentation Network\n(WBRN) [Ed.: see Felix\n1684]. The report states:\n\u201cthere was not enough\ntime to consult effectively\nwith College staff and\nstudents\u201d and \u201cOfficer\nTrustees were assigned to\nlead consultation between\nFebruary and June, which\nfailed because of a lack of\nclarity of the network\u2019s\npurpose\u201d.\nThe WBRN idea was\nfirst announced in January\n2017, yet the Union felt\nit was appropriate to rush\nthrough the biggest expansion of the rep network\nin recent years, aiming\nfor implementation in\nOctober. No College staff\nwere consulted ahead of\nplanning for develop-ment, and the 17 students\nwho were consulted in\ndedicated sessions were\nall existing elected volun-teers, meaning no normal\nstudents or College staff\nhad the opportunity to\nvoice their concerns\nbefore the WBRN was\nset in motion. Mental\nhealth and wellbeing are\nincredibly sensitive issues\nthat should be handled\nwith delicate and careful\nplanning, yet the Union\nrushed this idea to meet a\ndeadline, akin to bulls in a\nchina shop.\nDepartmental staff\nwere not satisfied with\nthis either. The report said\n\u201csome departments made\nrequests for changes to\nthe Network that were not\npossible due to the timing\nand progress of implementation\u201d, showing that\nat least someone in the\nUnion understood the\nissues associated with\nrushing through such a\nbig change. However,\nwhen students raised\ntheir concerns about the\nnetwork with departmental staff, they were\nmet with antagonism:\n\u201cstudents that opposed\nthe implementation of\nthe Network met with\ndepartments before the\nUnion, which led to biases\nand uncertainty from\ndepartmental staff and\ndiscredited the work that\nhad been completed\u201d. It\nis shameful that the Union\ncould not be bothered to\nreach staff before students\ntook the initiative \u2013\nshouldn\u2019t this have been\ndone before the idea was\neven announced? Not one\nof these people thought to\ndelay the implementation\nuntil consultation was\nthoroughly complete, and\nall concerns addressed.\nThe report is a damning\nindictment of the Union\n\u2013 it shows that concerns\nwere ignored due to the\nrushed implementation,\nthat concerned students\nwere dismissed, and that\nthe Union did not address\nthe requests of staff. Most\nvolunteers who propose\nideas that they are not in\nfavour of. It isn\u2019t something that they themselves\nfeel the need to do.\nThis isn\u2019t just a one-off\nissue. Student consultation is something that the\nUnion has failed to do\ntime and time again. Most\nrecently, the timetable for\nthe Leadership Elections\nwas altered, with the\nusual week\u2019s campaigning\nperiod being removed.\nGovernance Committee\nminutes reveal that this\nwas an idea suggested\nby the Union President,\nin order to decrease the\nstress on candidates,\nbut ended up being implemented without any\nformal input from student\nvolunteers outside Trustee\nBoard. While the President had good intentions\nwhen suggesting the\nidea, the new timetable\nmeans that voters have\nno opportunity to find out\nwho is running and what\nplatform each candidate\nis running on. The Union\nencourages people to vote\nas soon as voting opens,\nwhich coincides with\nthe start of campaigning,\ngiving an inherent advantage to those who are\nwell known on campus.\nJust imagine if you were\nrunning for a position\nagainst an existing sabbatical officer\u2026 With this\nnew election timetable,\nyou would be decimated\nsimply because you\nweren\u2019t given the chance\nto get your name out.\nThis is yet another drastic\nchange the Union have\nmade where students were\nnot consulted.\nAlthough I have been\ncritical of the Union in\nthis article, that\u2019s not to\nsay that the Union hasn\u2019t\nconsulted students at\nall. Last year, the end of\nzero-tolerance deadlines\nand the smoking ban were\nachieved by consulting\nstudents through online\npolls. But consultation\nneeds to be done on all\nthe big changesmade and\nstances taken by the Union\n\u2013 after all, the sole purpose\nfor its existence is to represent students. The DPW\nhas given the green light\nfor consultation regarding the Social Mobility\nOfficer, and the Union\nPresident is working\nwith myself to look into\na petitions system on the\nUnion website. These are\nwelcome developments\nthat show a positive\nattitude to student engage-ment; I hope that next\nyear\u2019s sabbatical officers\ntake note and realise the\nimportance of student\nvoice and input.\nThinking of being an OT next year? Make sure to consult students! // Imperial College Union\n\u201cI hope next\nyear\u2019s sabbs\nrealise the\nimportance of\nstudent voice\nand input\u201d\nimportantly, it showed\nthat the Union does not\ncare about consulting the\nstudents it claims to repre-sent. It appears that, to the\nminds of the senior Union\nofficials, consultation is a\ntask to be given to student\n\n"

Fortress\nHarlington was the\nsetting for yet another\nleague game for the\nmighty Imperial Los\nDos Fifteenos. The boys\nwere greeted with perfect\nconditions: a premature\nwarm-up from the ref\nand a late City team (Los\nBanditos). An early game\nagainst this side had\nproven to be too much\nfor them to handle, as the\nmatch was postponed \u2013\nmost likely due to their\nfear of facing another 59\n\u2013 0 loss at the hands of the\nundefeated Imperial side.\nNonetheless, the game\nkicked off, and, with\nseveral strong carries,\nfresher Sorrell Cowen\nproved why he is a prime\npoaching target for the\nfirst XV as he sliced\nthrough the defence to bag\nthe first try of the match.\nSeveral minutes after the\nrestart, a penalty awarded\ndeep in the opposition 22\nallowed for an exquisite\nback\u2019s move straight off\nthe training paddock to\nsend Andy Lumb over for\na meat pie. A similar try\nwas scored just minutes\nlater, with Andy making\nreal use of that caterpillar warm-up to squirm\nover for his hat-trick\navoidance. However, Los\nBanditos did not roll over.\nA strong restart, played\ndeep into the Imperial\n22, was taken up by\nour very own Matthieu\nJalibert (Gustave Roux\nde Bezieux) who sent a\nbeautiful kick over the\nhalfway line and straight\ninto touch \u2013 too bad he\nhad already travelled ten\nmetres outside of the 22\nand had lost Imperial\na dangerous attacking\nopportunity. He was\nsubsequently sent for a\nHead Injury Assessment.\nNevertheless, the strong\ndefensive work displayed\nby Imperial proved to be\nimpenetrable and, a quick\nturnover ball \u2013 beautiful\nstructured play interlinking forwards and backs\n\u2013 sent Vice-Captain Ifan\nDafydd over the whitewash for two fine tries\nputting him in contention\nfor hat-trick avoidance.\nWith the points racking up\nin quick succession and\nthe bonus point already\nachieved, concentration\ndipped ever so slightly,\nevidenced by the fact that\n\u2018Questions Beckman?\u2019\nmanaged to sneak over\nin the corner after a move\nfresh out of Ethos on a\nTuesday morning came to\nfruition.\nHalftime came and\nwent with a number of\nsubstitutions, including\nMichael Rudman, who\nimpressed with his\nsnaky runs followed by\nquestionable offloads.\nHowever, snaky run of\nthe day was awarded to\nCaptain Jack Wheaton\nwho left a trail of bodies\nnot dissimilar to that of a\nrunway in Amsterdam to\nscore beneath the sticks.\nOther notable moments\nincluded Tom Johnston\nmaking a fine break only\nnot to have the pace to\nfinish it off (he later attributed this lack of pace to\nhis un-aerodynamic-like\nlid which is now suspected missing). Luckily for\nhim Ifan (who clearly has\nsome pace) was there in\nsupport to cross over for\nhis third of the day, how\nhe didn\u2019t get man of the\nmatch and is not writing\nthis report right now I\nwill never know. With\nFraser adding the extras,\nthe match was coming to\na close. Late on, Sam Ha\nmade an appearance on to\nthe pitch, although due to\nthe absolute dominance\nof the Imperial side the\nmatch was called off\nearly, leaving Sam desperate for some action.\nAfter some fine dashing,\nhe made what can only\nbe described as the most\ndominant tackle ever\nmade\u2026 on a wall. Fine\nform. All in all, an excellent outing for the 2nd\nXV\nwith a 50 \u2013 0 win to keep\ntheir undefeated streak\ngoing.

All players were\nrested and hungry for a\nsecond victory against\nthe Pythons after such a\nclose call last time the two\nteams met.\nThe game had a slow\nstart with both offenses\ntaking heavy penalties and\nmaking unforced errors,\nwhile both defences made\nsure to keep the other\nteam humble. There were\nseveral close calls for\nthe Immortals in the first\nthree quarters of play with\nrunning back Song \u201cmore\nfumbles than MVPs\u201d\nZhai making incredible\nyardage and leaving\nthe Cambridge defence\nstunned on many offen-ton brought about a surge\nof vigour and determination to defend the runway\nwith hail and snow.

As the\nquarter continued, another\nbrilliant drive by the\noffense left the immortals\nat 1st and goal against the\nPythons.

We were\nthere for revenge, after\nlosing earlier in the year\nto RUMS by just three\npoints. The match started\nwith lots of kicking, and\nboth teams were trying to\nplay for territory. Quick\nhands from Oliver Duffy\nallowed Josh Pope to\nmake a break down the\nwing and exert some\nattacking pressure on\nRUMS. From a scrum\non their five-metre line,\nWill Aynsley picked, ran\nten metres sideways, and\nscored \u2013 0-5 to Imperial.\nThis was the strong\nstart that we needed.\nHowever, RUMS came\nback fighting and were\nable to score after a couple\nof missed tackles, making\nthe score 5-5. RUMS continued to attack and made\na line break from a scrum\nin our 22, scoring under\nthe posts. We were now\n12-5 down.\nFortunately, Amin\nOmarouayache had been\nwatching the Six Nations\nover the weekend and had\nbeen inspired by Jonny\nSexton\u2019s drop goal against\nFrance. Using the skills\nhe had acquired from\nHarry Allingham\u2019s \u2018free\nlessons\u2019 on kicking, Amin\nslotted one over himself.\nUnfortunately, we gave\naway a penalty in our half\nand RUMS capitalised,\nmaking the score 15-8,\njust before half time.\nThe second half was\njust as tense as the first.\nOur forwards were\ndominant and made lots\nof yards by mauling the\nball from lineouts (when\nthe referee allowed us\nto anyway). The pack\nmauled the ball over the\nline and Ali Zaboronsky,\nplaying in the second row,\nnabbed his first try of the\ngame. Amin added the\nextras, meaning we were\nnow drawing 15-15.\nBack defending in our\nown half, we were caught\noffside and RUMS scored\nan easy penalty. Another\nmassive lineout maul\nfrom our forwards led to\nAli scoring another try.\n18-20 to Imperial. I can\nonly conclude that Ali\u2019s\ntalents are wasted playing\nat number eight. RUMS\nwere awarded multiple\npenalties from people\ncomplaining to the referee\nwhen decisions went\nagainst us, and this killed\na lot of the momentum\nwe had in the match.\nRUMS scored another\npenalty and went ahead\nby one point. Duffy and\nPope once again linked up\nnicely down the wing, and\nsome beautiful offloads\nallowed Duffy to score.\nThe adulation he received\nfrom his teammates after\nscoring unfortunately\ngave Duffy some false\nconfidence, and would\nhe foolishly later shave\nhalf his head whilst\nFiesta Dashing, wrongly\nbelieving he could pull off\nthe half-mullet-Skrillex-hairstyle he now has.\nImperial defended hard\nfor the last ten minutes\nof the game, and RUMS\nwere relentless in attack.\nPoor discipline lead to\neasy-target Nathan being\nsin binned after an accumulation of penalties.\nRUMS came close to\nscoring on a number of\noccasions, but our defence\nheld strong. The clock\nwent red and RUMS were\nin possession of the ball\ninside our 22. This was\nthe last play of the game.\nWe defended desperately\nas RUMS spread the ball\nfrom touchline to touch-line, but in the end, there\nwas nothing we could\ndo to stop them scoring.\nThey made good use of\ntheir greater numbers and\nscored from an overlap out\nwide. RUMS kicked the\nconversion to make the\nfinal score 28-25. Another\nthree-point loss.

In spite of\nthat, visual novels are\nlargely dismissed by some\nmembers of the gaming\ncommunity as not being\n\u2018real\u2019 games and having\nlittle value as games.\nBefore we can discuss\nvisual novels and why\ndismissing them is wrong,\nwe need to answer one\nquestion: are visual\nnovels really games? This\nquestion is one which\nhas infuriated several\npeople and has been a\nsource of heated debate.\nTo get a clear answer to\nthis question, it\u2019ll help\nto introduce some game\ndesigner lingo we can\nplay around with.\nTo describe video\ngames from a more\nacademic perspective,\nthere are two different\nterms that are used, nar-ratology and ludology.\nThe narratology approach\nstates that games are\nfundamentally another\nmedium of narrative and\nstorytelling, in a similar\nfashion to novels and\nfilms, and should therefore\nbe approached in such\na fashion. The ludology\napproach, however,\nstates that games are\nfundamentally interactive\nsystems and any story\nthey\u2019re trying to tell is of\nsecondary importance to\nthe gameplay itself.\n\u201cAs the market\nand popularity\nof these\ngames grew,\nso did their\nvariety and\naccessibility\u201d\n\u201cCross-genre\nvisual novels\ncontain other\naspects of\ngames\u201d\nFrom these definitions,\nit is obvious to see visual\nnovels fall into the nar-ratological approach to\nvideo games. They are,\nat the end of day, novels\nwith art, music, and a\ntext heavy narrative. Any\nmini-games or gameplay\naspects they have usually\nserve to add to the plot\nas opposed to standing\nalongside it. However,\nsome visual novels\nhave a more ludological\napproach as well.\nThere are some visual\nnovels which have more\nclassic video game\nelements such as those\nof RPG games. You get\nto control the characters\nin the story and can get\ninvolved in sequnces\nrequiring fine hand-eye\ncoordination. At the end\nof the day, however, while\nvisual novels should\ntechnically be considered\ngames, there will always\nbe people who will argue\nagainst this and pick\nsomething like Call of\nDuty over Phoenix Wright.\nOne could ask how\nvisual novels became so\npopular in the first place.\nWhen they started out,\nthey were a bit more\nniche; they were predominantly popular in Japan\nand mostly consisted\nof \u2018dating simulators\u2019.\nPeople made their own\ntranslations and imported\nthem online where the\ndemand for these types\nof games grew from other\nplayers around the world.\nThe developers then made\nmore versions of these\ngames, translated and\ndubbed, to help cater to\nthis niche market. As the\nmarket and popularity of\nthese games grew, so did\ntheir variety and accessi-bility.\nThey grew to encompass more than just dating\nsimulators and began\noverlapping with quite\na few genres. It\u2019s gotten\nto the point where even\nwestern developers are\nalso joining the market\nand making their own\nvisual novels. Telltale\nGames are an especially\npopular studio, having\nproduced several critically\nacclaimed series like The\nWalking Dead. Even some\nindie studios are getting in\non the action with recent\nhits like Dream Daddy:\nA Dad Dating Simulator\nand Doki Doki Literature\nClub.\nA large reason for\ntheir popularity boom\nand success is the fact\nthat visual novels are\nvery flexible. While they\nare a genre in and of\nthemselves, they can also\noverlap with other types\nof games with regards\nto story or gameplay.\nCross-genre visual novels\ncontain other aspects of\ngames such as dramatic\nsurvival horror with The\nWalking Dead and puzzle\nsolving with Professor\nLayton. These types of\nvisual novels are usually\nmore appealing to the\ncasual audience and are\nthe ones that, at the end\nof the day, are the most\nmainstream. In fact, these\nparticular games are\nmore than just interactive\nnovels with pretty pictures\nand nice music: they are\ndamn awesome games in\ntheir own right.\nWhat\u2019s the real selling\npoint of visual novels?\nAs the name might\nimply, they are just very\ngood at telling stories. In\nfact, you could consider\nthem the middle ground\nbetween reading a book\nor watching a movie and\nusing VR or roleplaying\nto experience a story\nyourself. Visual novels\ncan act as \u2018choose\u2019 your\nown adventure games,\nwhere you control the\ncharacters and can choose\nwhich direction you want\nthe story to go. Granted,\nthis is arguably limited,\nas for all intents and\npurposes, you can only\nreally stick to the the story\nand direction specified by\nthe developers (something\nplayers of Telltale games\nare often frustrated by).\nBut in their defence,\nprogramming stories\nwhich can take multiple\ndirections and endings\nare a lot of work and are\nusually left for games\nwhich are also heavy\non gameplay and length\nto really get a fulfilling\nexperience. Having said\nthat, the choices you make\nin most visual novels feel\nimpactful in the moment\nand if nothing else, get\nthe player personally\ninvested at that time. At\nthe end of the day, you can\nalways get emotionally\ninvested in the story and\ncry your eyes out at select\nmoments.\nUltimately, visual\nnovels are a genre unlike\nany other in that they are\nfocused on storytelling\nbut with a different presentation and interaction\nthan what you\u2019d get from\na book or film. Just make\nsure you can tolerate\nreading: if not, you might\nas well stick to shooting\ndown enemy soldiers.\nYour choices: beat up or beat up a lot // Telltale Games\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nObjection! // Capcom\n\n"

Roses and chocolates are seen in every\nshop window, the nights\nare cold, and all you really\nwant are cuddles, kisses\nand\u2026 rough animalistic\nsex. Now the question is,\ncan you have both? Can\nyou go from holding hands\nand looking lovingly into\neach other\u2019s eyes to then\nsuddenly being pinned\ndown and slapped by\nyour partner? When you\nstart looking at the more\nextreme sides of BDSM,\nthe idea of romance fitting\ninto that seems less and\nless likely. But let\u2019s try\nand break it down.\nLet\u2019s go for an extreme\nexample: let\u2019s take a\npower play relationship\nwhere one of you takes the\ndominant role (dom) and\nthe other the submissive\n(sub). This kind of relationship can have as little\nor as many boundaries as\nyou like. For a sub dom\npair to work they must\ncommunicate all the time,\ntelling each other what\nthey like and what they\ndon\u2019t; making sure they\nare both comfortable with\nthe more experimental\nstuff they are trying.\nNow quite a lot of\npeople think that being a\nsub is lazy or weak, but as\na matter of fact it is a very\nbrave thing to do. To give\nyourself completely to\nanother person needs a lot\nof confidence and more\nimportantly trust. The\ntrust between a sub dom\npair is very strong and\nrightfully so; if you are\ngoing to have someone\ntie you down you need to\ntrust them enough not to\nabuse the power you have\ngiven them. This level of\ntrust is not usually needed\nin standard relationship\ndynamics, but romance\nis all about trusting each\nother with your feelings\nand emotions so in a way\nthe trust between a sub\nand a dom intensifies the\nromantic aspect of the\nrelationship.\nRough, kinky sex can\ninvolve a lot of things\nbut one thing that must\nhappen every single time\nis \u2018After Care\u2019. When\nthe sex is done, and the\npanting ceases the dom\nmust then take on the role\nof carer, kissing, stroking\nand cuddling the sub; this\nis what is meant by After\nCare. After Care is a way\nof showing the sub that\neverything the dom had\ndone to them no matter\nhow aggressive was\nnot real, and that it was\njust an act. It is there to\nreassure both parties that\nthe sex was enjoyable on\nboth sides. It lets the sub\nfeel safe and secure and\nallows the dom to be more\naffectionate and express\na softer side. After Care\nis essentially when the\ncouple stop being rough\nwith each other and start\nbeing romantic. This has\nto be done every time\nrough kinky sex happens\nwhich means the more\nkinky sex you have the\nmore romantic cuddles\nyou will be having, which\nautomatically increases\nyour romance level.\nRomance is usually\nassociated with calm,\nslow -paced dates such as\ncandle lit dinners, making\nout under the stars, and\nleaving flowers at each\nother\u2019s door. Kinky activities tend to be the opposite\nof this, being hard,\nenergetic and fast-paced.\nSure, candle lit dinners\nare romantic \u2013 it requires\nplanning, dressing up and\nchoosing the best wine.\nBut suppose you get\nturned on by something\na little outside the norm \u2013\nfurries, for example (you\ncan look that up on your\nValentine\u2019s day doesn\u2019t just have to be about chocolates and roses // Flickr\n\u201cRomantic\nand kinky\nrelationships\nare two sides\nof the same\ncoin. They\nenhance one\nanother\u201d\nbecause they know how\nmuch you enjoy it. If that\nisn\u2019t love I don\u2019t know\nwhat is!\nRomantic and kinky\nrelationships are opposite\nsides of the same coin.\nThey enhance one\nanother, both contributing\nto the flourishing of your\nrelationship. Romance\nkeeps it caring and affectionate while the kinky\npart allows you both to\nexperiment and learn more\nabout each other bringing\nyou closer together than\nyou ever were before.\nRomance will always be\nneeded because everyone\nlikes to receive roses\nevery once in a while.\nBut for me without the\nchoking, the biting and\nthe scratching\u2026 well then\nits all rather boring. So,\nmy advice would be next\ntime you want to give\nyour partner flowers, ask\nthem if that is what they\nreally want\u2026\nGetting kinky, 15th century style // Flickr\nown). Your partner may\nnot be into it as much\nas you and yet is still ok\nwith dressing up as one\nWe are taking way too many pictures\nBy considering the perspective of both photographers and travellers, you can find that there\u2019s\nreal benefit in taking a break from our shooting-obsessed culture\nCOMMENT\nYan Kee\nComment Writer\nW\nith the advancement\nof smart-p h o n e s\nand digital photography,\nan absurd number of\npictures are taken by\npeople every single day\n\u2013 whether for Instagram,\nFacebook, or just for\npersonal collection.\nThis New Year\u2019s Eve,\nI spent the last few hours\nof 2017 patiently waiting\nfor the annual fireworks\ndisplay in London. The\nfireworks only lasted 15\nminutes, and to update my\nfriends and family I took\none series of burst pictures\nand picked one out at the\nend. But what I realised is\nthat a lot of people were\nrecording videos for the\nwhole show, as if they\nare going to see those\namazing fireworks better\non their 5-inch smartphone screens rather than\nwith their own bare eyes.\nIt made me realise that all\nof us need to reflect more\non our obsession with\nphoto-taking, instead of\nblindly following what\nthe crowd around us does.\nWhat are the benefits\nof reducing the number\nof pictures taken, when\ndigital storage means\nwe\u2019re completely free to\ntake more? To answer this\nquestion, let\u2019s look at this\nproblem from different\nperspectives: those of a\ntraveller, a photographer,\nand \u2013 most importantly\n\u2013 someone like me and\nyou, who merely wants\nto record memories in the\nform of pictures.\nTo clarify, my own\ndefinition of a traveller\nis someone who chooses\ntravelling as a lifestyle,\nrather than a break from\ntheir normal life routine.\nFrom a traveller\u2019s per-spective, then, the main\npreference is to live in\nthe moment. To have a\nsmartphone or camera\nstanding in between your\neye and the event occurring is to live in a different\nworld, outside of the real\none. That could mean\nsomething different for\ndifferent people, but for\nmost it\u2019s the social media\nworld.\nOur lives are heavily\ninterconnected through\nsocial media, especially\nwith family and friends,\nand the boundaries\nbetween the real world\nand that of social media\nhave become heavily\nblurred. Once we see\nsomething interesting,\nour addiction to \u2018share\u2019\nit gives us that oxytocin\nboost, stimulating that\n\u2018good-feeling\u2019 whenever\nwe receive a notification,\nlike, or comment. Why\nnot take a break from it?\nTake a break from social\nmedia for a week, a month\nor even a year and experience the traveller\u2019s ideal\nof remaining within the\nreal world, being mindful,\nliving in the moment,\nwhichever term you\u2019d like\nto use.\nFrom a photographer\u2019s\nperspective, on the\nother hand, taking more\npictures is good in the\nsense that you\u2019ll have a\nbetter chance of capturing\na good one. However, it\u2019s\nactually a limitation that\ncan allow you to fully\nutilise your creativity.\nOn my last day-trip to\nYork, I took exactly seven\npictures with my polaroid\ncamera: I was forced to\n\u2018try out\u2019 the shots first\nusing my phone camera\nand judge the composition\nbefore carefully taking\nlimited pictures. At the\nend, you not only end up\na better photographer, but\nthe memories also stick as\nefforts and thoughts that\nwere behind those beautiful shots.\nstill prefer methods such\nas sketching or journal\nwriting to record past\nevents \u2013 when thoughts\nare being put into it, the\ndetails are described so\nwell that if feels like you\nare time travelling when\nyou revisit those works.\nAll in all, whatever the\nperspective we choose,\nall of us could gain real\nbenefits taking a break\nfrom these frantic pho-to-taking sessions. I hope\nnext time you\u2019re deciding\nto let the convenience\nof picture-taking get the\nbetter of you, think about\nthis article; try and experience the moment fully\nwith your senses, look at\nthe distinct colours of a\nrainbow, smell the rain,\ntouch the wet soil and\nlisten to the sounds of the\nforest.\nLondoners filming the NYE firework display // Yan Kee\n\u201cSoak it in with\nyour own eyes.\nExperience\nthe moment\nbefore taking\nthat picture\u201d\nNow, let\u2019s part from\nthose two extremes and\nlook from the perspective\nof someone who takes\npictures for the sake of\nmemories. The problem\nis not taking pictures,\nnor the intention behind\nit, but rather the process\nof taking them \u2013 it\u2019s so\neasy and quick, as if the\nmeaning behind those\npictures was long gone,\nand what\u2019s left is a hollow,\ndigital format photo filled\nwith colours and lines no\none is familiar with. Let\u2019s\ntake some time before\ntaking the image: soak it in\nwith your own eyes, experience the moment before\ntaking that picture. For me\npersonally, it\u2019s very hard\nto indulge in memories\nlooking at pictures taken\nwith little effort and time.\nThat\u2019s why some people\nThe only well-exposed polaroid I took in York // Yan Kee\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1685\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nThe essential rainbow reading list\nArts Editor Indira Mallik brings us on a journey of queer literature that forms her \u2018rainbow reading list\u2019, as part of\nLGBT History Month here in the UK.\nBOOKS\nIndira Mallik\nArts Editor\nA\nlengthy reading\nlist, I think, is\na quintessential\npart of the\ncoming out story of every\nbookish queer person.\nFrom tentative forays into\nSarah Waters\u2019s debauched\nVictoriana to focused\nstudy of Virginia Woolf\u2019s\nfabulously winding sen-tences, we use books to\ntry and find ourselves, to\nbuild a roadmap of how to\nbe in the world.\nOne of the first queer\nbooks I discovered, and\none that remains one of\nmy absolute favourites\nis Alice Walker\u2019s The\nColour Purple. Spanning\nforty years, it tells the\nstory of Celie, a girl\nmarried off to a man\nmany years her senior,\nwho is forced to live a life\nof abuse, drudgery, and\nquiet desperation. Celie\u2019s\nmisery is interrupted by\nthe arrival of Shug Avery,\na glamorous singer who is\nthe object of Celie\u2019s husband\u2019s affections. Shug\nand Celie improbably\nbegin an affair, marking a\nturn in both their fortunes.\nIn a story otherwise\nfull of heartbreak, the\nrelationship between the\nwomen is a bright spark\nof joy. Written largely in\nthe first person in the form\nof Celie\u2019s confessional\nletters to God, Walker\u2019s\n\u201cMaggie\nNelson\u2019s\nwriting on life\nand death sing\non the page\nin her The\nArgonauts\u201d\n\u201cMany of the\nbest of the\nqueer canon\nhave found\ncritical acclaim\non the big\nscreen\u201d\nness is incidental to The\nColour Purple, taking a\nbackseat to the humanist\nphilosophy that Walker\nwants to convey; this is\nnot the case in Maggie\nNelson\u2019s The Argonauts,\nwhich places the complexities of queer life at\nits heart. Part-essay on\nqueer politics and the pa-triarchy, and part memoir,\nin this magnificent book\nNelson describes the\nperiod in her life where\nher partner Harry came\nout as trans and began\ntestosterone treatment. By\nexamining her struggle\nto square her identity as\na lesbian woman with\nHarry\u2019s journey, Nelson\nexplores the confines of a\nheteronormative society.\nIt is a fascinating look at\ngender and sexuality and\nhow little both matter in\nthe face of individual,\npersonal attraction. Some\nof the most powerful\npassages in the book come\nlater on: as Nelson falls\npregnant after a lengthy\nIVF process, Harry\u2019s\nmother becomes terminally ill, and Nelson\u2019s writing\non life and death sings on\nthe page. Addressed to\nHarry throughout, who\nappears as the ubiquitous\n\u2018you\u2019, The Argonauts is\nan erudite, lyrical, and\ndeeply moving love letter.\nHailed as a pioneer\nof queer literature, and\ncertainly one of the first\nto weave a trans narra-tive, few novels explore\nevolving relationships\nand a life in flux with\ngreater verve than\nVirginia Woolf\u2019s Orlando\n(which is also incidentally\nconsidered a love letter\n\u2013 Woolf wrote the novel\nwith Vita Sackville-West\nin mind). Orlando follows\nthe life of an Elizabethan\ncourtier born a man who\nthen wakes up a woman\nand goes on to charm her\nway through 300 years of\nEnglish history.

Now\nISIS has lost its territorial\npower base and has disappeared as a state entity,\nit seems Syria has taken\nthe place of Rwanda and\nSudan, places ravaged\nby misery and death but\nsoon left in the dustbin of\npermanent instability and\nchaos. It is a sad fact that\nthe relative lack of interest\nthat the war generates in\nour media is missing the\nbig picture, the events that\ncould have far reaching\nimplications in history.\nAnd this new phase, triggered by operation Olive\nBranch, is one of them.\nOn the 20th\nof January,\nthe Turkish army and\nallied Syrian opposition\nmilitias invaded Efrin\ncanton, one of the three\nautonomous regions that\nform the Democratic\nFederation of Northern\nSyria, colloquially known\nas Rojava. To understand\nwhy, we need to go back to\na time before the civil war,\nwhen the Kurdish peoples\nwere being slaughtered in\nthe four countries where\nthey form a significant\nminority of the popula-tion: Turkey, Iran, Iraq,\nand Syria. While the\ngassing of Kurdish civilians by Saddam Hussein\nand the measures taken\nagainst this ethnicity by\nthe Turkish state (which\nI shall expand upon later)\nremain in collective\nmemory as nefarious\nactions, the treatment the\nKurds faced by the regime\nofHafezalAssad(fatherof\nBashar) in Syria is almost\nuniversally unknown, if\nequally despicable. Imitating the other Ba\u2019athist\ndictatorships of the area,\nthe Syrian state stripped\nthe Kurds from their na-tionality, and forced them\nto undergo a process of\nArabization that amounted\nto sheer cultural genocide.\nWhen in 2011 the Arab\nSpring protests reached\nSyria, the oppressed\nKurdish minority took\nadvantage of the general\nunrest and seized control\nof the areas where it\nformed a majority of the\npopulation, as the Syrian\narmy was recalled to\nDamascus to fight in more\nimportant fronts.The main\nKurdish group throughout\nthe war has been the\nPeople Protection Units\n(YPG), an organization\nwhich has an ideology\nthat combines libertarian socialism, gender\nequality, respect for ethnic\nminorities, secularism\nand green politics. These\nideas set them apart from\nevery other participant in\nthe war and indeed from\nany other Middle Eastern\nentity. It is therefore not\nsurprising that Rojava\nsoon came under attack by\nthe radical Islamist forces\nof ISIS, which ended\nin total failure for the\nlatter entity as the YPG,\nnow organized into a\nwider coalition known as\nSyrian Democratic Forces\n(SDF), launched a successful counterattack that\nresulted in the liberation\nof the bulk of the areas\nterrorized by ISIS, including the capital of the so\ncalled caliphate, Raqqa, in\n2017. The relationship of\nRojava with the other two\nmain factions of the war,\nthe islamist Free Syrian\nArmy (FSA) and the\nSyrian Arab Army (SAA,\nmilitary branch of the\nAssad regime) fluctuates\nfrom periods of convenient alliance to full-out\nwar. In another sign of\nthe convoluted mess that\nis the Syrian Civil War,\nthe SDF have received\nboth American (otherwise\nFSA supporting) and\nRussian (main Bashar\nally) air support in its\noffensive against ISIS. In\nthe meantime, Rojava has\ncontinued to implement\nits policies on the territories it controls, including\ndirect democratization,\ncooperatives, the banning\nof honour killings and\nchild marriages, mandatory women quotas and\nintegration of the Arab,\nKurdish, Assyrian and\nArmenian ethnicities in a\nmultinational state.\nThe crucial position\nof Syria in the Middle\nEast map, in the centre\nof a region desired by\nambitious powers like\nQatar, Iran and Israel, has\nmade foreign involvement\na common staple of the\nwar. Readers with a good\nknowledge of geography\nhave probably noticed\nalready that northern\nSyria shares a long border\nwith a rising power of its\nown kind, Turkey. The\nevents that have unfolded\nin Rojava have set off all\nthe alarms in Ankara, and\nhave awoken the anger\nof the Turkish dictator,\nRecep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\nIt is interesting to\ncompare the political\nevolution of Rojava and\nTurkey during the last few\nyears. While Rojava has\nmoved towards a society\nbased on progressive\nvalues, Erdo\u011fan has\nused the once legitimate\npower he obtained from\nthe ballot box to create\na Frankenstein monster\nof a country, a state\nthat combines the worst\naspects of Kemalism and\nIslamism to persecute\npolitical opponents and\ncurtail freedoms. Using\nthe excuse of the 2016\ncoup attempt, Erdo\u011fan\nhas cracked down on civil\nliberties, jailing teachers,\ncivil servants and journalists alike, while women\u2019s\nrights are increasingly\nthreatened as the country\nis forced to become\nless and less secular.\nThe repression against\nthe Kurdish minority\nin Turkey (estimated to\nbe around 20% of the\npopulation) has grown as\nthe government pursues\npolicies that silence the\nKurdish activists that are\nbrave enough to raise their\nvoices against it.\nThese factors,\ncombined with a foreign\npolicy that has been described as neo-Ottomanist\n(seeking to regain the\ninfluence lost by Turkey\nafter the disbandment of\nthe Ottoman Empire a\nfew years after the end\nof the First World War),\nexplain why the Turkish\narmy is entering the fields\nof Rojava with fire and\nfury. Turkey cannot risk\nthe spread of the Rojava\nproject to its Kurdish\ninhabited areas, and fears\na reactivation of the\nKurdistan Workers Party\n(PKK), a guerrilla group\nthat has been waging\nwar against the Turkish\nstate for decades and that\nshares similar ideologies\nto Rojava. Indeed, while\nthe YPG was born independently in Syria, portraits of Abdullah \u2018Apo\u2019\n\u00d6calan are common in\nnorthern Syria. However,\nthe one key difference\nbetween both groups is\nthat while the PKK fights\nfor a united Kurdistan,\nRojava aspires to become\none of the federal states\nthat would be set up in a\nfuture, Assad free democratic Syria.\nNone of this matters to\nErdo\u011fan. In recent dec-larations, he has vowed\nto expel the Kurdish terrorists from the cantons,\naccusing them of collaborating with ISIS. The main\naim of Turkey is the establishment of a puppet state\nover the border, controlled\nby military personnel and\nruled along the lines of\nErdo\u011fanist Turkey. Something similar happened in\nCyprus during the 70s,\nand 40 years later Turkish\ntroops still occupy the\nNorthern third of the\nisland. In their advance\nthrough Rojava territory,\nthe Turkish allied militias\nhave already carried out\nwar crimes, including the\nmutilation and beheading\nof a young Kurdish female\nfighter. It is outrageous\nthat a country that is both\na NATO member and candidate state for membership in the EU is allowed\nto commit these atrocities.\nWestern governments\nhave already turned a\nblind eye to the human\nrights abuses taking place\nin Turkey itself. Don\u2019t\nallow them to spread the\nterror elsewhere. Write\nto your MP, demonstrate,\njoin organisations like\nAmnesty International\nthat are denouncing this\nmadness.

Rest\nassured that this is at the\nfront of the minds of both\nUnion volunteers (includ-ing the authors of this\narticle) and departmental\nstaff. In the short term,\nwe will be working to\nminimise the impact on\nstudents\u2019results for exams\nand major coursework\nthat take place during\nthe strike period. We will\nalso be looking at ways\nof limiting the impact\nthis will have on end-of-year exams, such as by\nlobbying departments to\namend exam questions.\nIn spite of these\nconcerns being at the\nforefront of the debate,\nlast Tuesday the Union\nvoted overwhelmingly in\nsupport of our staff in this\ndispute. While the reasons\nbehind this decision were\ndeeply pragmatic, with\nthe long term interests of\nstudents in focus, it\u2019s no\nwonder that students em-pathise with the staff on\nthis matter. We too have\nbeen at the rough end of\nCollege cuts \u2013 cuts to operating hours, price hikes,\nand failure to invest in\nunderperforming essential\nservices such as the Counselling service. This sort\nof penny-pinching (SCR\nBreakfast, anyone?),\nwhich hugely contributes\nto Imperial\u2019s poor student\nand staff satisfaction\nratings, is done in spite of\na huge annual operating\nsurplus of around \u00a3100\nmillion. So whose side\ncould we possibly take:\nthat of College manage-ment, for whom profit\ncomes first, or of the staff\nmembers who actually\ndeliver our education?\nThe decision of the\nUnion is a welcome\nmove, as it adds to the\nmounting pressure on\nCollege management to\nencourage their national\nbody to return to negoti-ations.

Short of this, it\nwould be worth conveying that you support their\nright to strike, and that\nwhile there are short term\ndrawbacks, this action is\nin the long term interest of\nboth staff and students.

Members of\nUCU have scheduled 14\ndays of escalating strike\naction over a four-week\nperiod, in response to a\ndispute with Universities\nUK (UUK) over pension\nscheme changes.\nCurrently UUK are\nplanning a change to the\nUniversities Superannuation Scheme (USS),\nwhich would take it from\na defined benefit scheme,\nin which the employer\npays in contributions up\nto a salary of \u00a355,000,\nto a defined contribution\nscheme, in which the\npension value is linked\nto the performance of the\nstock market.\nStudents at Council\nraised concerns over the\nimpact the strike would\nhave to education, particularly to exams and\nmajor coursework dead-lines. They also expressed\nconcern over potential\ntuition fees lost as a result\nof the strikes. Sood stated\nthat there were a number\nof things representatives\ncould do to mitigate the\nimpact the strikes would\nhave on major coursework\nand exams \u2013 a position\nstated in the paper. Since\nexternal invigilators are\nnot part of UCU, exams\nscheduled for the strike\nperiod should not be\naffected.\nThe approach to the\nstrike will depend department by department, but\nit is likely that teaching\nmissed would not be\nretaught and will be examined in full.

Their\nfirst studio album since\n2013, it is the most distinct\nevolution of their sound\nsince 2009\u2019s Tonight.\nDriving this is the addition of two new members\nto the band, Julian Corrie\n(who has released albums\nas Miaoux Miaoux) on\nkeyboards and backing\nvocals, and Dino Bardot\non guitar and backing\nvocals. Together they take\nthe place of co-founder of\nthe band, Nick McCarthy,\nwho left in 2016.\nOn Always Ascending,\nFranz Ferdinand take McCarthy\u2019s replacement as\nsomething of a fresh start\n\u2013 though that\u2019s not to say\nthey\u2019ve stopped sounding\nlike Franz Ferdinand. Like\ntheir previous work, this\nis still an indie rock album\nwhose punchy basslines\nand funky rhythm guitar\nparts show a clear intention to get listeners\ndancing. But Always\nAscending also features\nsome of the band\u2019s most\ninventive songwriting.\nSonically, Corrie\u2019s\nmeandering and spacey\nkeyboard parts take a\ncentral role. Elements of\ndisco and production from\nPhilippe Zdar (of French\nhouse group Cassius) lend\ndistinct sound throughout.\nInfluence from Sparks,\nwith whom Franz Ferdinand recorded an album in\n2015, is especially evident\non tracks such as \u2018Lois\nLane\u2019and \u2018Huck and Jim\u2019,\nwhich slickly transition\nthrough multiple parts,\nfrom soaring choruses to\naggressively marching\nverses. Sifting through the\nunconventional structures\non these songs, frontman\n\u201cIt\u2019s a care-free\napproach to\nsongwriting\nthat sounds\nlike the band\nis genuinely\nenjoying\ntrying new\nthings\u201d\nAlex Kapranos\u2019 sardonic\nlyrics push towards the ridiculous (\u201cAt the over-30s\nsingles night it\u2019s bleak\u201d,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to America\n/ we\u2019re gonna tell them\nabout the NHS\u201d). It\u2019s an\nambitious and care-free\napproach to songwriting\nthat sounds like the band\nis genuinely enjoying\ntrying new things.\nThatapproachisevident\nelsewhere. \u2018Lazy Boy\u2019,\nperhaps the most typically\nFranz Ferdinand track on\nthe record, grooves to a\n10/4 time signature. Many\nof the melodies on Always\nAscending were written\nusing a keyboard that\npushes the player\u2019s fingers\nto unanticipated notes.\nThe title track borrows\nfrom a practice in traditional Ethiopian music to\nhave chord progressions\nthat never return to their\nroot note but instead constantly evolve. Kapranos\nand co. found the sonic\nequivalent of this in the\nShepard Tone, an aural\nillusion of constantly\nincreasing pitch (which\nyou may have heard of\nmost recently for its use\nin Christopher Nolan\u2019s\nfilm Dunkirk for both the\nscore, and as an influence\non the narrative structure).\nThe band translate\nthis idea of ascension\ninto a meandering chord\nprogression played over\nthe Shepard Tone, and\nKapranos\u2019 meta, punning\nlyrics \u201cThe shepherd\nmisleads so you think\nyou\u2019re transcending.\u201d In\nthis instance, Kapranos\nveers dangerously close\nto trying too hard to\nsound clever, but, as with\nseveral other tracks on the\nalbum, is spared by the\nplucky instrumentation\nthat reminds us that this is\npop, not poetry.\nThat said, two of the\nbest tracks on the album,\n\u2018The Academy Award\u2019\nand \u2018Glimpse of Love\u2019\nare those in which the\nlyrics\u2019 social commentary\nis most astute. The first, a\ngentle acoustic ballad that\nappears midway through\nthe album, sees Kapranos\nmocking self-obsessed,\nsocial-media culture:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a camera held in\nevery hand / The glamour\nof applause in every mind\n/ but the Academy Award\nfor good times goes to\nyou.\u201d\nThe lyrics to \u2018Glimpse\nof Love\u2019 juxtapose lines\nfrom tabloid papers\u2019\ncomments about female\ncelebrities\u2019 bodies over a\nwonderfully retro, catchy\nsynth riff (\u201cA glimpse of\nperfect abs / In a flimsy\nfloral dress / Shows off\nher slender frame / Enjoys\na private stroll\u201d). In doing\nso, Kapranos exposes the\npredatory nature of such\ncomments as the product\nof a search for some\ntrue emotion, a glimpse\nof love: \u201cLove is gonna\ncome as a photographer.\u201d\nKapranos claims that\nthe lyrics on this album\nemerged from trying to\nwrite from the emotional\nstate of detailed characters\nhe created with bassist\nBob Hardy. As he steps\ninto these personas, he\nfurther plays the character\nof frontman, perhaps due\nto McCarthy\u2019s absence,\nand ventures lower into\nhis vocal range, in which\nhe is arguably now more\ncomfortable, with perceptible confidence.\nYet for all that is new\non this album, some of\nthe best songs are those\nin which the band\u2019s\nnewfound adventurous-ness is contained. Equally\nthere are a few tracks\nwhich are somewhat lack-luster, like \u2018Paper Cages\u2019,\n\u2018Finally\u2019 and closer\n\u2018Slow Don\u2019t Kill Me\nSlow\u2019. These are not bad\nsongs, but are the clearest\nrepresentation of Always\nAscending\u2019s biggest flaw:\nwhile offering refreshing\nsong ideas and proving\nthat they are technically\nable to execute them,\nFranz Ferdinand fail\nto nail the razor-sharp\ntightness and ability to\nself-edit that made their\nearliest material such\ngreat pop-rock. At the\nother extreme, the experimentation on this album\nis rarely sufficiently seen\nthrough in terms of capti-vating, thought-provoking\nor emotional lyrics. A\nnumber of the cuts on this\nrecord simply feel a little\ntoo drawn out or unremarkable for it to be truly\nexcellent. That might not\nbe as disappointing as\nsounds, though, as Always\nAscending remains a solid\nalbum that will add some\nof the most interesting\nmaterial to Franz Ferdinand\u2019s excellent live\nback-catalogue.\nI think I used to have a screensaver like that // Domino\nMUSIC\nNeel Le Penru\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Franz Ferdinand.\nLabel: Domino.

Ironically located\nnext to a butchery, the\nsmall fast food-esque\nestablishment often has\nlines of people queuing\nout the door. The no frills\nmenu is based around\ntheir signature fried\nchicken which constitutes\nof seitan \u2013 a gluten, wheat\nbased protein source that\nhas a meaty texture and\naccommodates whatever\nflavours are introduced to\nit. A couple of sides and\noff-menu dessert items are\nalso offered.\nI got the Spicy Temple\nBurger \u2013 a steal at \u00a36 or\nmake it a meal with a side\nof fries and a cola as I did\nfor an additional \u00a32.\nWith the tantalizing\nsmell of fried food in the\nair, the American diner-in-spired store was crowded\nwith people ordering food\nand waiting for it to be\nprepared. Every so often\nthe cashier would call out\na name that corresponded\nto the brown paper bag\nshe held up, and the sea\nof heads would all turn\ntowards her in hopeful\nexcitement.\nAfter what seemed like\na tormentous time waiting\n(be patient McDonald\u2019s\nfrequenters!), my name\nwas finally hollered. And\nthere it was \u2013 a vegan\nburger that truly lives\nup to its rep. One bite\nin and I was taken. The\nchicken was the most\nrealistic mock meat I\u2019ve\nhad with a texture vaguely\nThe bun too was im-pressive, soft with slight\nsweetness like brioche,\ncomplementing the\n\u2018chicken\u2019 well. The fries\nwere standard (but good)\nand a generous portion,\nskinny and crunchy with\njust the lightest pinch of\nsalt. Needless to say, the\nburger was savoured and\ngone within minutes and I\nleft Hackney feeling very\nmuch fulfilled considering\nmy wearing and hazardous\njourney there through the\nmiserable English rain.\nThis place is a must try\nfor vegans that are looking\nto explore the various\nculinary indulgences\nthat modern plant-based\ntechnology can offer, for\ncurious meat-eaters and\nespecially sceptics. Plantbased foods need not be\ndubbed as \u2018just salad\u2019\n\u2013 you can easily enjoy\nthe same foods you experienced as a meat-eater\nas a vegan or vegetarian;\nvarious restaurants have\nalready introduced vegan\nversions of foods such\nas pizza, Bolognese, fish\nand chips, and now, fried\nchicken!\nNote: Hackney is far\nfrom Central London\n\u2013 blessedly, a second\nstore has opened up its\ndoors in Camden \u2013 hailed\nTemple of Camden, with\nthe same offerings plus\nnew beef-inspired burgers\non the menu. I suppose\nit\u2019s about time for another\nindulgence!\nEat Tokyo: Budget-friendly Japanese Delights\nI\n\u2019ve been meaning to\nrave about this small\nchain that boasts authentic Japanese food\nfor a while, but my degree\nhas unfortunately been\ndistracting me. Although\nEat Tokyo has locations\nthroughout London and\nJapan, I have only visited\nthe Holborn restaurant so\nfar. The Hammersmith\nand Notting Hill branches are probably more\nconveniently located for\nImperial students if you\nare keen to give the food a\ntry for yourselves, which\nyou really should, go on,\ntreat yourself.\nAfter ducking under\nthe precariously low\nbanner hanging above the\nfront entrance - who said\nwasabi was the most dangerous aspect of Japanese\nfood - you are initially\nstruck by the liveliness of\nthe entrance, filled with\neager customers waiting\nfor a table and sushi being\nexpertly crafted behind\nthe counter to your right.\nWith the exception of the\nornate wooden booths\nplaced in the first room\nthat you come across, the\nd\u00e9cor within the maze of\nfollowing rooms is considerably more basic, but\nno matter, you are here for\nthe food.\nMy first experience of\nEat Tokyo\u2019s menu was\nsimply overwhelming.\nUpon opening the no-vella-sized booklet filled\nwith enticing glossy\npictures, I started to panic\nat the prospect of making\na decision. If you are as\nindecisive as me, I would\nrecommend a bento box,\nwhich is essentially a\nfew mini meals in one.\nMy favourite comes with\nchicken teriyaki, salmon,\nsushi, rice and salad,\nwhich somehow, they\nalso make taste amazing.\nAlthough I haven\u2019t tried it\nmyself, I\u2019ve been told that\nthe Tokyo Dragon is, and\nquote, \u201clife-changing\u201dquite an endorsement. For\nthis dish, sushi is arranged\nin a row with a prawn\nmimicking the head of the\ndragon. It certainly looks\nimpressive.\nWhat\u2019s more, Eat\nTokyo is surprisingly\naffordable. You can easily\ndine out here for under\na tenner (as long as you\nsteer clear of the drinks).\nFans of the katsu curry\nwill rejoice; you can order\na massive, and I mean\nmassive, portion to share\nfor only \u00a39. Meaning, you\ncan eat out in London for\nunder a fiver \u2013 miracles do\nhappen.\nFOOD\nChloe Foo\nFood Writer\nFOOD\nAlice Davage\nFood Editor\nAlmost looks like real chicken // Chloe Foo\nEven the soy sauce pot is cute// Alice Davage\nArtily-arranged sushimi with miso soup // Alice Davage\n\u201cOne bite\nin and I was\ntaken\u201d\nresembling that of cheap\nchildhood nuggets.

I am here\nto convince you that this\nshow is, without a doubt,\na masterpiece and well\nworth a place on the top\nof your watchlist.\nEssentially, this show\nrevolves around a single\ndrawn out dick joke. The\ncrime centred on this\nshow is all the teachers\u2019\ncars at a high school\nbeing spray painted with\ndicks. A troublemaking\nstudent, Dylan Maxwell,\nis accused and expelled,\nsolely based on his past\nantics. Two students from\nthe same high school,\nPeter and Sam, begin a\ndocumentary not too long\nafter to find out the truth\nof what really happened.\nAs this show somewhat\nparodies other crime documentaries like Serial and\nMaking a Murderer, this\nshow could have easily\nbeen a dumb comedy,\nmaking fun of the situation and the documentary\nformat. Instead, the show\nembraces its roots and\ngoes out of its way to be as\nprofessional and serious\nas possible. A saving point\nfor Dylan is the fact that\nthe dicks he has drawn in\nthe past don\u2019t match the\nones from the vandalism.\nEven though this sounds\nlike a stupid argument\non the surface, the show\n\u2013 or, to be more specific,\nPeter and Sam \u2013 treats\nthis as a serious piece of\nevidence that helps the\ncase. Throughout all the\nepisodes, we\u2019re treated\nto in-depth analysis of\nunusual and seemingly\ndumb pieces of evidence\nand to see how they build\ntowards the bigger picture.\nNo investigation is\nperfect, and Peter and Sam\nhit several roadblocks and\ndead ends on their way\nto find out the truth. But\nfor every hypothesis and\npiece of evidence that\u2019s\ninvestigated, we find out\n\u201cWe see\nthe social\ndynamics of\nthe school,\ninstead of it\nbeing used as\na backdrop\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that\nall the footage\nis\u2018filmed\u2019by\nstudents adds\na layer of\ncomplexity to\nthe plot\u201d\nmore and more about\nthe high school and the\npeople. We see the social\ndynamics of school,\nhow the teachers are\nlooked at from the eyes\nof the students and other\nteachers, and what dirty\nsecrets people have been\nhiding. This makes the\nhigh school environment\nfeel more involved and\nrelevant in a unique way,\nin stark contrast from\nother forms of media\nwhere it is typically used\nas a backdrop for other\nplotlines.\nAnother thing unique\nabout this documentary\nis that it is \u2018filmed\u2019 by\nstudents of the school.\nThis adds an extra layer of\ncomplexity as the students\nare investigating their own\nteachers and their fellow\npeers. In a more realistic\ndepiction to previous\nshows in the past, we see\nhow the documentary\nleads to repercussions in\nthe real world as, amongst\nother things, a teacher gets\nfired and a relationship is\nbroken up. Peter and Sam\nindulge in a lot of shady\njournalism practises like\nsharing private conversations and messages, as\nwell as secretly recording\nconversations. To the\nshow\u2019s credit, we see\nthem get called out on a\nlot of their actions and\ndirections multiple times.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see a\ndocumentary affecting the\nlives of the creators and\nthose around them.\nThis show is even able\nto convey a message to\nits viewers if you read\nbetween the lines. High\nschool is ultimately a turbulent and uncertain time\nfor many. A lot of people\nhave their futures written\noff, solely based on what\na teacher marks down as\nwell as what the people\naround may think of\nthem. Even though it may\nseem like a lot of effort\nto prove the innocence\nof an already morally\ndubious student, it raises\nthe question of whether\nwe really can or deserve\nto just write people off so\neasily. A truly heartening\nmoment in the series\nis when Dylan tries to\nturn over a new leaf and\nbecome a model student.\nBut once he hears what\nhis teacher and his peers\nthink of him, he descends\nback into his old antics,\nventing his frustration and\nwondering whether it\u2019d be\neasier to just be the delinquent everyone assumes\nhe already is.\nIt\u2019s not just the quality\nand production level of\nthe show which is so\nhigh, but also the skill and\nperformance of the actors.\nEven though most are\nrelatively small-scale or\nunknown, they are all able\nto give very powerful and\nbelievable performances.\nOne highlight for me was\nwhen Dylan\u2019s girlfriend\nwas being grilled on\nwhere exactly she was\nduring the vandalism. She\nsays no lines while being\nquestioned but the way\nthe actress\u2019 expressions\nchange and her eyes well\nup is comparable to any\nemotionally-intense scene\nin Hollywood today.\nAmerican Vandal is\nexceptionally intense and\naddictive. As the investigation proceeds forward\nin both the most serious\nand ludicrous ways, you\u2019ll\nfind yourself invested in\neveryone\u2019s lives, appreciating all the big and small\nmoments the show has to\noffer. At the end of the\nday, it provides an earnest\nand emotional look at\nhigh school through the\neyes of someone written\noff as a joke.\nAmerican Vandal is\navailable on Netflix now.\nWho drew those dicks? // Netflix\nTELEVISION\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nCreators: Dan Perrault,\nTony Yacenda.

The\nprevious highest number\nof nominations was 831,\nwhich was achieved last\nacademic year. In total\n935 staff members were\nnominated, including\nsupport staff, tutors, and\nlecturers \u2013 again, the\nhighest number in the\naward\u2019s five year history.\nThis year saw a shift\nin the strategy used to\ncommunicate the SACAs\nnominations process, with\nthe campaign shortened to\na three week period, following a \u2018soft launch\u2019 at\nthe end of last term. Nick\nBurstow, Deputy President (Education), who is\nresponsible for the award\nprocess, also worked\nwith constituent unions\n(CUs) on communicating\nthe nominations to\nstudents, with increased\ninvolvement from the\nFaculty of Medicine. The\nnominations process was\nalso simplified, to reduce\nthe time it took to submit\nnominations.\nMichael Edwards,\nPresident of the Royal\nCollege of Science Union\n(RCSU), told Felix:\n\u201cNick\u2019s new grassroots\nmethod of achieving this\nexcellent batch of SACAs\nsubmissions is to be\napplauded, and hopefully\nthis signifies a major\nchange in the way that\nOfficer Trustees and staff\nengage critically with\nUnion volunteers.\u201d\nClaudia Caravello,\nPresident of City and\nGuilds College Union,\ntold Felix: \u201cI think it\nwas great to get the CUs\ninvolved, asking them to\nhelp advertise and also\nput in their weekly emails.\nI think that the Union\nwould benefit greatly in\nactively asking us for help\non more things, which in\nturn would strengthen the\nlinks between CUs and\nICU.\u201d\nThe Union has targeted\n1000 nominations for the\npast few years, but has\nalways fallen short of\nthis target. Burstow told\nFelix: \u201cThe SACAs give\nour students the chance\nto recognise and reward\nexcellence among College\nstaff. This huge number of\nSACAs nominations reflects just how much students value excellent staff,\nand allows our students to\nshowcase this excellence\nto the College.\u201d\nThis is the sixth cycle\nof the SACAs. Staff can\nbe nominated across\neight areas, including\nBest Supervision, Best\nInnovation, and Best\nFeedback, among others.\nAll staff members who\nare nominated for an\naward will receive a mug,\nand shortlisted staff will\nattend the prize ceremony\nin May.\ncan be an effective way\nof drawing attention to\ncertain problems, \u201canyone\nwith an email address\ncan sign these external\npetitions, meaning there\nis no guarantee that everyone who has signed is a\nstudent at Imperial.\u201d\nproposal.\nThere was not enough\ntime in Council to discuss\nthe finer details of what\nform such a petition\nsystem would take; Alex\nChippy Compton, ICU\nPresident, will be meeting\nwith Bhatnagar and other\nstudents to discuss the\noverall structure of the\nsystem, and will return to\nCouncil with a proposal\nlater this academic year.\nBhatnagar told Felix:\n\u201cI'm glad to see Council\nhave approved the\nproposal for a petitions\nsystem. The vast majority\nof students do not wish to\nbe involved in the bureaucracy of the Union, so a\npetitions system that puts\npower directly into the\nhands of students would\nbe a powerful tool.\u201d\nThis academic year\nalone has seen a number\nof popular petitions relating to topics at Imperial,\nincluding ones asking to\nexpand Ethos gym, and\nto bring Stella 4% back to\nUnion bars \u2013 something\nthat was done at the beginning of this term. The\nmost recent petition is\nto stop the closure of St.\nMary\u2019s Swimming Pool\nat the end of the academic\nyear. It has been signed by\nmore than 2,000 people.\nFintan O\u2019Connor,\nDeputy President\n(Welfare), told Felix:\n\u201cPetitions and campaigns\nare growing in number\nevery year at Imperial,\nand a new and accessible\npetitions system will only\nhelp channel the energy\nand ideas of our members.\nWe were already thinking\nabout introducing one\nas part of our review of\nour democracy and gov-ernance, and we\u2019re glad\nthat Union Council has\nnow thrown their weight\nbehind the idea.\u201d\nA number of other\npapers were also discussed at Union Council.\nAs well as the petitions\npaper, Council passed\npapers in support of the\nUCU strike, as well as\nones relating to tankard\npolicy and minuting of\nICU meetings.

While\nsome took this to mean he\nhad been released, other\nsources say Dr Madani is\nstill under surveillance.\nProfessor Emami\u2019s\ndeath was ruled as a\nsuicide by the Iranian\ngovernment, but highlights increasing tensions\nbetween the Iranian\ngovernment and environ-mentalists, who are often\ndual-nationals.\nThe UN this week\nasked the Iranian\ngovernment to allow\nenvironmental activists\nto work without being\ntargeted. UN Environment head, Erik Solheim,\nissued a statement saying\n\u201cEnvironmental rights\nare human rights, and\nwe all have an obligation\nto protect them.

There\u2019s\nlate, and then\nthere\u2019s this rocket.\nConceived in\n2004, Falcon Heavy was\nin the works before I could\nride a bike or reliably spell\nthe word \u201crocket\u201d. Sure,\nexpecting a timely release\nfrom Elon Musk would\nbe simply ludicrous, but\nthis is a bit much even\nby future-leader-of-Mars\u2019\nstandards. Why did the\nworld\u2019s most ambitious\naerospace venture find it\nso hard to do little more\nthan tape three Falcon 9\nrockets to each other?\nIn a presentation\nin 2011, Elon Musk\nannounced the Falcon\nHeavy would fly in\n2013. But come around\n2013 and the world\u2019s\nmost powerful rocket\nseemingly became stuck\nbeing \u201cjust six months\naway\u201d, staying that way\nfor nearly five years. As\nSpaceX engineers quickly\nfound out, duct tape just\nwasn\u2019t going to do the job.\nBut gluing two boosters to\na Falcon 9 core wasn\u2019t the\nonly challenge SpaceX\nfaced. Each time it\nseemed like we\u2019d finally\nsee the Falcon Heavy fly,\nthe Falcon 9 team would\nbring about a newer,\nmore powerful version\nof the rocket. Back to the\ndrawing board it was for\nthe Falcon Heavy then, as\nthe concept based around\nthe now-deprecated\nFalcon 9 version fell apart\nlike a Jenga tower.\nRather critically,\nthough, SpaceX had little\nreason to rush with the\nHeavy. Throughout its\ndevelopment, it became\nincreasingly unclear why\nthe world needed the\nrocket at all. Its lifting\npower, while impressive,\nwasn\u2019t taking anyone to\nMars anytime soon. In\nfact, by 2017 the cheaper\nFalcon 9 had nearly\nmatched the 25,000kg\npayload capacity Falcon\nHeavy had originally been\ndesigned for. By then,\nhowever, Falcon Heavy\nwas far enough in its development to stick around,\nand with upgraded engines\nfrom its little brother had\nthe power to become a\nsuper-heavy launcher \u2013 a\nrocket capable of launching more than 50,000kg to\nlow earth orbit.\nAs it rolled out to\nLaunch Complex 39A\nat Cape Canaveral, the\nsame one Apollo 11 took\noff from in 1969, the\nFalcon Heavy could carry\nup to 63,800kg to low\nearth orbit \u2013 the mass of\n23 elephants or a single\nsmall space station. Yet in\nwhat must be the maddest\ndisplay of opulence in\nhuman history, Elon Musk\ndidn\u2019t choose to launch a\nspace station or scientific\nexperiments but rather his\nvery own midnight cherry\nTesla Roadster. With a\nfigurine of a man in the\ndriver\u2019s seat. With a little\nmodel of a Tesla Roadster\non the dashboard and its\nvery own tiny passenger\nin its tiny seat. All while\nthe convertible\u2019s stereo\nplayed David Bowie\u2019s\n\u2018Space Oddity\u2019 in the one\nmedium through which\nsound can\u2019t travel. Which\nwasagreatidea.No,really,\nI\u2019m being serious. True to\ntheir original purpose as\nballistic missiles, rockets\ngo kaboom pretty damn\noften, especially the first\ntime they\u2019re launched. In\nfact, the only rocket to\nfire this many engines at\nonce was the Soviet N1\nwhich wasn\u2019t particularly\nsuccessful (to put it\nmildly). In four launches,\nit spectacularly failed four\ntimes, creating the most\npowerful non-nuclear\nexplosion ever registered\nin the process.\nThe odds were against\nthe Falcon taking flight,\nso whatever was going up\nthat day had to be okay\nwith going down equally\nas quickly should things\ngo south. Luckily, a Tesla\nRoadster was as affordable as rocket payloads\nget, much cheaper than\nFalcon Heavy lifted off last Tuesday, becoming the world\u2019s most powerful rocket // Brandon Thonen\nTECH\nTom Mrazek\nTech Editor\nThere\u2019s now a car floating through space and it\u2019s not as crazy as it sounds // SpaceX\na satellite or just about\nanything else that might\nbe useful. Expressed in\nFiveSixEight\u2019s curly\nfries, blowing up a Tesla\nRoadster would have cost\nMusk only about 50,000\nportions of this overrated\nsnack compared to the\nover 300 million plates a\nproper satellite is worth.\nIncredible as it may sound,\nlaunching a convertible\ninto space appears to have\nbeen a wise and economical decision.\nCrispy metaphors\naside, the Falcon Heavy\ntest flight was the perfect\npublicity stunt not only\nfor SpaceX, but space\ntravel as a whole. The\nfootage of the entire\nlaunch has seen nearly 20\nmillion views, far more\nthan any other space-re-lated video on YouTube.\nEven the most sceptical\nand ambivalent observers\nadmit that seeing a car\nsoaring through space is\njust awe-inspiring.\nRather disappointingly,\nthis launch appears to\nhave saturated the market\nfor sports cars in space, so\nthe Falcon Heavy will now\nneed to find a different\npurpose. Despite countless doubts surrounding\nits actual usefulness, the\nheavy lifter has proven\nitself to be pretty capable.\nIn theory, we should see it\ncompete with the likes of\nthe Delta IV Heavy or the\nSpace Launch System, but\nin practice it dominates\nboth ULA\u2019s and NASA\u2019s\n(respectively) entries.\nThe Delta IV Heavy costs\n$435 million per launch\nwhile the SLS is projected\nto swallow half a billion\nof taxpayers\u2019money every\ntime it lifts off. No matter\nwhat crunchy treat you\nconvert that to, it\u2019s just\nbloody gluttony. What\u2019s\nworse yet, the SLS isn\u2019t\neven a real rocket, but\nrather just a series of very,\nvery, very, very expensive\nblueprints. An astronomical $18 billion worth of\nblueprints to be exact.\nWith a launch cost of just\n$150 million ($90 million\nwhen reused) and double\nthe Delta IV Heavy\u2019s\nshadow of doubt over its\nHawthorne headquarters.\nAfter the launch of the\nZUMA satellite, a piece\nof tech so classified\nit\u2019s unclear who even\npurchased the launch,\nspeculation arose that the\n$1 billion, taxpayer-fund-ed satellite had been lost\nto a failure. No evidence\npointed to SpaceX being at\nfault, but a billion dollars\nis a billion dollars (or 1.7\nbillion Cadbury Cream\nEggs if you will) and\neven after COO Gwynne\nShotwell and Gen. John\nThompson claimed that\nFalcon 9 performed\nnominally and the public\nwas enraged. Due to the\nsecretive nature of the\nmission, the fault could\nlie with payload adapter\nmanufacturer Northrop\nGrumman or even no one\nat all \u2013 ZUMA could be\njust fully operational, and\nwe\u2019d be none the wiser.\nNevertheless, after the\ndown that was the ZUMA\nmission, confidence was\nrestored with the Falcon\nHeavy and it is the press\npayload, does the Falcon\nHeavy render the above\nrockets obsolete? Not\nquite. Especially the SLS\nis here to stay, its only\npurpose being to utilize\nspare parts from the Space\nShuttle in an attempt to\nconvince America that a\nfragile, overpriced spaceplane wasn\u2019t a terrible\nidea.\nImpressive as it may\nconference after that very\ntest flight that featured\na very important quote\nfrom Musk. Commenting\non the successful launch,\nthe clearly intoxicated\n(though that could just be\nhis normal self) supervillain stated that he is now\nconfident \u201cthat BFR is\nreally quite workable\u201d.\nThe BFR, to clarify,\nis the real deal. After\nthe powerful yet limited\nstepping stone that is\nthe Falcon Heavy, it is\nthe BFR that aspires to\ntake mankind to Mars.\nIts acronym stands for\nnone other than the \u201cBig\nFucking Rocket\u201d (a reference to the \u201cBig Fucking\nGun\u201d, a weapon from the\n90s videogame Doom), or\nas SpaceX\u2019s boring legal\nteam chose to call it \u2013 the\n\u201cBig Falcon Rocket\u201d. The\nBFR is expected to first\nfly next year, with a cargo\nflight to Mars expected as\nearly as 2022. Of course,\nthese dates are to be taken\nwith a Big Fucking Pile\nof Salt, as it is commonly\nknown that Musk\u2019s\nestimates are given in\nMartian years (the conversion rate to Earth years\nis approximately 1.88:1).\nWhen it does finally take\nflight, the BFR will be\na fully reusable monster\nof a ship with 150 tons\nof payload capacity,\nthirty-one engines, and a\ncabin comparable to that\nof an Airbus A380.\nWith the Falcon\nHeavy test flight, we\u2019ve\nwitnessed without a doubt\nthe most impressive feat\nof engineering in the past\nfew decades. The fact\nthat a hypersonic flying\nmachine split into three\nand then landed (well, two\nfor three on the landings\ndue to an issue on one of\nthe boosters) with fantastic precision while taking\nan electric car and a sci-fi\nspacesuit to the asteroid\nbelt is hard to take in.\nBest of all, if this is just a\npreface to the commercial\nspace age, we\u2019re in for\none hell of a ride.\nThe BFR is the real deal and aspires to get us to Mars. Also, I\u2019ll eat my hat if it flies in 2019.// SpaceX\n\u201cBlowing up\na Tesla would\nbe worth\nabout 50,000\nportions of\ncurly fries\u201d\nbe, the Falcon Heavy\nwon\u2019t shake up the launch\nmarket nearly as much as\nthe Falcon 9 did.

Tesnie Evans from\nWales, who dispatched\nEngland\u2019s number one\nLaura Massaro in the\nsecond round, faced\nNour ElTayeb. Despite\nthe crowd getting behind\nher, she lost her tightly\ncontested Quarter-Final.\nWhile the majority of the\nIC Squash players asked\nfor pictures and autographs with the players,\nIC squash\u2019s No 1 Pamela\nHathway, a former\nGerman national player,\ngot the chance for a catch\nup with her old friends and\nformer rivals, now at the\nvery top of the women\u2019s\ninternational rankings.\nThe day ended with\nEngland\u2019s No1 Nick Matthew\u2019s last appearance at\na World Championship.\nHe faced the tournament\nfavourite \u2013 and arguably\nthe best player over the\npast twelve months \u2013\nMohamed ElShorbagy.\nThe \u2018Beast from Alexandria\u2019 got off to a better\nstart and forced Matthew\ninto long and testing\nrallies, knowing that the\n37-year old struggled\nwith age and injuries.\nElShorbagy threatened\nto march through to the\nSemi-Finals, but Matthew\ndug deep and with\nmassive support on home\nsoil as well as the odd\nrowdy chant from the IC\ngang (\u201cMatthew\u2019s on fire,\nElShorbagy\u2019s terrified\u201d)\nhe won the 3rd\ngame.\nHowever, ElShorbagy\nregrouped, won the 4th\ngame and denied Matthew\na famous comeback.\nUnfortunately we weren\u2019t\nable to catch both of them\nfor selfies as we had to\nstorm off to the station in\norder to catch the last train\nback to London \u2013 it turned\nout to be late anyway.\nIC Squash returned to\nrainy Manchester for the\nFinals.

Mohamed\nregained his concentration\nwhile Marwan seemed to\nlose faith. Having drawn\nlevel, he then pulled away\nto clinch the game and\ntrophy for the first time.\nAfter the prize giving\nceremony, we were able\nto take selfies with the\nfinalists and even with\nNick Matthew, whom we\nhad missed on the day of\nthe Quarters.

There are\neight extant species of\npangolin found across\nthe Old World in Africa\nand south-east Asia;\nthey relatively unassuming animals, they\nare also known as scaly\nanteaters due to the fact\nthat they are covered in\nhard scales and predate\non ants and termites.\nPangolins essentially\nfill the same niche as\nthe anteaters of the New\nWorld, but due to their\nunique scales' they are\nthe most hunted and\ntrafficked animal on the\nface of the planet. Their\ndefence mechanism,\nwhen faced with a threat,\nis to curl up into a ball and\nto let their scales do all\nthe work. But while this is\ngreat if the adversary is a\nbig cat, it makes it easier\nfor poachers to round\ndeveloped.\nTheir scales are used\nin traditional Chinese\nmedicine and, once dried,\nit is believed they can be\nused to alleviate a number\nof symptoms. The scales\nare made of keratin \u2013 the\nsame material as our hair\nand nails \u2013 but there is no\nscientific evidence that\nthere is any benefit of\ntheir use. As a result of the\nhigh demand of pangolin\nscales, they can sell on\nthe black market for over\n$3,000 a kilogram. They\nare also traded for their\nmeat, which is a delicacy\nin some cultures. To\nsupply a growing market\nin Asia, it is estimated that\nup to 100,000 pangolins\nare captured every year\nfrom across Africa and\nAsia, with most being\nshipped and sold in China\nand Vietnam.\nIn 2016, all eight\nspecies of pangolin were\ngiven CITES Appendix I\nlisting \u2013 the highest level\nof international legal protection \u2013 to help combat\nthe illegal trade of the\nanimals. However, these\nmeasure may have come a\nlittle too late for the four\nAsian species which have\nunfortunately been decimated by illegal poaching.\nPart of the problem stems\nfrom the fact that pangolins breed slowly meaning\nthe population takes time\nto recover. This international protection may be\na step forward in the right\ndirection, but as with all\nillegal trade (such as that\nin ivory and rhino horns),\ncriminal organisations\nalways find ways around\nthe legislation. It has\nbecome increasingly clear\nthat as the Asian species\nhave declined, their\nAfrican counterparts are\nnow being targeted more\nheavily.

However, to reach\nthe brain the carriers must\ncross the highly selective\nmembrane called the\nblood-brain barrier. This\nbarrier restricts most substances in the blood from\npassing into the brain,\nand, consequently, has\nrendered many drugs and\ntherapies ineffective for\nuse in the brain. A recent\nstudy, however, published\nin Molecular Medicine,\nexamined and identified\npotential virus capsid\nstructures which are able\nto cross the blood-brain\nbarrier, thereby improving\nthe reach of gene therapy.\nThis study examined\nadeno-associated viruses\n(a group of non-patho-genic viruses) for their\nability to potentially\nimprove transmission\nthrough the blood-brain\nbarrier, and to enhance\nspecificity for brain cells.\nScientists compared the\ncapsid features of two\ntype of adenoviruses\nwhich differed by their\nability to pass through the\nblood-brain barrier, and\nsubsequently generated a\nlibrary consisting of the\nindividual parts of the\ncapsid structure from the\nformer virus. Using the\nlibrary, they swapped out\nthe corresponding parts\nin the capsid of the latter\nvirus one-by-one. The\nresult of each individual\nswap was noted, and the\nparts responsible for the\nchange in their ability\nwere identified, with their\nproperties characterised.\nThe results of this study\nprove useful, since they\nshow the capability we\nhave to control movement\nthrough the blood-brain\nbarrier. This provides the\npossibility of developing\nnovel therapies which\ncan target the diseases\nassociated with brain and\nspinal cord \u2013 such as brain\ntumours \u2013 which have not\nproved an easy target due\nto this barrier. The current\nstrategy involves providing a high dosage of the\ntherapy, but this causes\nside effects by infecting\nnon-target cells. By improving the specificity of\ncrossing the blood-brain\nbarrier, one can reduce the\ndose amounts and also the\ncost of therapy.\nThe study is promis-ing, but requires further\nresearch to ensure the\nrobustness for the proof\nof concept. As mice were\nthe subjects of this study,\nit is likely that the findings\nmay not be representative\nof human conditions, and\nthus the effectiveness\nof the study in human\nsamples needs to be\nestablished. Furthermore,\nthis study has only accounted for the challenges\nassociated with crossing\nthe blood-brain barrier,\nbut the final gene therapy\nmight still be limited by\nfurther complications\nsuch as improper dosage\nand possible side effects.\nNonetheless, it kindles\nhope we may be able to\ntarget the brain-associated\ndiseases which have for\nso long eluded the reach\nof medicine.\nThe famed blood-brain barrier // Wikimedia\nWork hard, play harder \u2013 how playing can improve\nSTEM subjects\nNext time you\u2019re called out for playing video games when you\u2019re meant to be revising, just remember that such\ngames can improve your spatial reasoning skills.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nI\nmperial College\nLondon is a science,\ntechnology, engineer-ing, and mathematics\n(STEM) focused university with, sadly, an uneven\nmale to female ratio.\nHowever, the imbalance\nof gender in STEM\nsubjects is not localised\nto Imperial \u2013 this trend\ncan be seen across the\nglobe. Whilst efforts had\nbeen made to steer more\nwomen into STEM, a new\nstudy in the U.S. may hold\nthe key to such a problem.\nSimply put, the potential solution is playing\ngames!\nA study involving 345\nundergraduate students\nshowed that spatial skills\nare significantly higher\nin students who played\naction, construction, or\nsports video games \u2013 the\nsame skills that are relatively higher in STEM\ngraduates.\nSuch statistically significant results are unsur-prising, as STEM subjects\noften require visualisation\nand interpretation of\ngraphs, diagrams, and\nmaps. However, a high\nspatial reasoning score\ncould also be explained\nby general intelligence.\nIn this study, standardised\ntest scores were used as\na proxy for intelligence.\nFurthermore, each spatial\ntest evaluates a different\naspect of the perception\nof spatiality \u2013 for instance\nmental rotation of objects,\nand finding hidden items\nin a large pattern.Thus, the\nassociation of intelligence\nwith STEM subjects can\nbe minimised.\nWhen inspecting the\ndata, researchers discovered that females presented with weaker spatial\nskills than males overall.\nConversely, after adjusting for the frequency at\nwhich the students played\nconstruction games, the\ndifferences disappeared.\nThis implies that women\nand men are equally good\nat spatial reasoning on a\nbiological level. However,\nmales tend to have an\nincreased interest in ac-tion-based games, thereby\ndeveloping better spatial\nskills.\nGiven the results, the\nresearch group suggested that schools should\nintroduce more spatial\nreasoning training in the\nclassroom to encourage\nstudents to take up STEM\n\u201cThe group\nsuggested\nschools should\nintroduce\nmore spatial\nreasoning\ntraining to\nencourage\nuptake of\nSTEM subjects\u201d\nsubjects. Since childhood\nplay has such an important\nrole in developing spatial\nskills, informal training\nsuch as video games and\nconstruction-based toys,\ne.g. Lego, at a young age\ncould be introduced to\nreduce the gender disparities seen with STEM\nFind out more and register online\nimperial.ac.uk/imperial-award\nReflect on your experiences\nGain the Imperial Award\nBenefits of registering and participating in the Award\n\u25a0 You can access a personal,\nprivate online portfolio\nallowing you to track your\nactivities and experiences.\n\u25a0 You\u2019ll get a line on your\ntranscript for each Stream\nyou complete and an extra\nline if you achieve the full\nImperial Award.\n\u25a0 Participating will improve\nyour writing skills,\nhelping with job and grant\napplications.\n\u25a0 You will develop attributes\nhighly valued by employers.\n\u25a0 There is nothing to lose,\nonly successful students\nhave the outcome recorded.\n\u25a0 The Imperial Award is\ndevelopmental, the skills\nyou learn and attributes you\ndevelop will remain with\nyou forever.\n\u25a0 There are plenty of support\nresources available,\nincluding workshops, videos\nand your personal tutor.\nsubjects.\nRest assured, not all\nhope is lost for grown-ups, as adulthood training\ncan still impact on spatial\ntraining.

Nevertheless,\nit is a cheap and relatively\neasy implementable intervention that may increase\nthe number of female and\nmale students progressing\ninto STEM subjects.
