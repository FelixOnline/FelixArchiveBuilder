FELIX EDITOR LOCKED IN THE TOWER On Monday, Colin Palmer, climbed the Queens Tower.\nHis aim was to photograph the bell ringers but due to a misunderstanding they left and locked him in the tower. It is\ndifficult to climb the spiral staircases in the dark but Colin\nhad to reach the upper balcony to call for help. The Editor\nwas worried that he would be imprisoned until the Rag Fete\non May 3rd when visitors pay to climb it. After an hour of\nshouting and waving his shirt a secretary from Sherfield\nphoned security believing Colin was going to jump.

    "content": "STUDENT COUNSELLOR\nI suppose anybody wearing the label 'Counsellor' round his neck\nmust expect to evoke some fairly odd reactions, both among\nstudents and among staff. For example: \" You deal with money\nand digs and things, do you?\", or \"I didn't know there was one,\"\nor \u2014 more ominously \u2014 \" Does anybody come to see you?\"\nI understand very well this is so, and have never doubted that\nthe onus for undermining the distorted perceptions that people\nmay have about my job is squarely in my court. This isn't just a theoretical consideration \u2014 it matters a lot in practical terms,\nbecause to the extent that such distortions are accepted, they\nsystematically exclude students (and staff) from help they should\nbe getting, and me from work I should be doing. Iam assured, by\npeople I respect, that what's needed is more publicity, and they\nmay be right, though it's not quite as simple as it sounds. There\nwould be no better way of arousing hostility and resentment than\nplastering the college with the patronising message, A: that you\nprobably need help, and B: that I'm the chap to give it.\nThings may be different elsewhere, but I 've always believed that\na low profile approach is likely to prove more effective in the long\nrun at IC, and only a rather guilty awareness that this happens to\ncoincide with my own inclinations and capacities prevents me\nfrom putting the point more assertively. Id are say there are\nothers, but the principal misconceptions about my particular job\nquite commonly held by staff and students alike, are as follows:\n1. The counsellor's office is in\nthe Health Centre, so there is\nan easy associative link with\nsickness, pathology \u2014 even madness. The counsellor is\nperceived as a low level psychiatrist, and it follows, therefore,\nthat it is not appropriate to go\nto see him unless one is in\next rem is, and it is not appropriate to refer a student to him\nexcept in these circumstances.\nThis, view is sometimes manifested in remarks like, \"I don't think it's serious enough to\nsend him to you . . . \" This is\nnot the place to examine the\nroots of such attitudes, which\nhave an apparently tenacious\nhold despite sustained and long term efforts to combat them, but they are, I believe,\noften linked in some way with a. wish to deny the s alien ce of\nfeeling in our lives \u2014 a mechanistic view of human behaviour\nunfortunate when they operate\nto preclude access to college\nsupport systems.\nIf the actual siting of the\ncounsellor's office has such sign if ice n ce, why not just change it? Indeed, some student\ncounsellors would hold that the\ndisadvantages of close association with doctors outweigh the\nadvantages \u2014 though many others, and so far, I 've been\namong them \u2014 tend to take\nthe other view. Professional counsellors certainly need the\nassured collaboration of doctors\nfor the straightforward reason\nthat the sort of difficulties which students properly bring\nto a counsellor, sometimes have connotations (for example,\ndepression and anxiety) which\nwho have, by definition, done\nwell academically hitherto. So far\nas undergraduates are concerned, I have no reason to think\nthat I meet anything other than\nan academically normal cross-section of the population, both in\nterms of their potential (ie, A level results), or in terms of\neventual performance on their\ndegree courses. Most of the\nstudents who come to see me are\ntrying to cope with problems\nwhich are only indirectly related\nto work, and which would give\nrise to difficulties for the most\nstable and academically competent among us. Of course, in\nsuch circumstances, we may well\nbe able to talk to other sympathetic people \u2014 tutors, super-visors, relatives, friends, and that\nmay be all that is needed. The\ncounsellor has a useful role to\nplay where, for one reason or\nanother, this informal network of\nsupport is either not available or\nnot sufficient.\n3. The counsellor is part of the\nestablishment \u2014 he keeps\nrecords, and you need an appointment to see him.\nDON ADDLING TON are medical, and where it is\nclearly in everyone's interests\nthat a student should be checked\nout by a sympathetic doctor,\nfrequently while maintaining his\nprimary link with the counsellor.\nIt is also quite common for the\ndoctors to ask a student to see\nme if they feel that the problems\ncould best be discussed with a non-medical person. This kind of\nflexible use of resources is more\nlikely to occur, and is easier to\nset up, if people work in the same\nbuilding.\n2. Students who go to see a counsellor, are either academically or personally inadequate,\nor both, and the counsellor's job,\nin essence, is to prop up the\nworld's whiners.\nAs it happens, each year I see a disproportionate number of\npost-graduate students, all of\nThe formality of a professional\ncounselling service is a bit\nirksome to some people, and I have no doubt that students\nsometimes turn to other sources\nof support (eg, Nightline) for that\nsort of reason. Also, for some\npeople of student age, the notion\nof rel at i ng to a middle-aged,\nmiddle-class man, who wears\ncollar and tie, is unacceptable \u2014\nquite simply because he is\nidentified in the student's mind\nwith values and beliefs which he\nperceives in his parents. I do\nkeep records, they are a prerequisite in a professional setting\n\u2014 but they are for my use only,\nand Iam scrupulously careful\nabout their security. I also run an\nappointments system, but so far\nas I know, there has not been a single occasion in six or seven\nyears when a student who wished to see me on any particular day has been unable to\ndo so. Indeed, many people do\ncall on me without an appoint-ment, and providing Iam free, I am entirely happy to talk to them\nthen and there.\n4. Do-good ers are by nature\nintrusive. Given half a chance,\nthey batten on to you and make\nyou feel quilty if you try to back -off. They can't wait to slap some\npseudo-scientific label on you.\nSuspicion of the motives of\npeople who set up shop as\nprofessional helpers is fair\nenough. I suppose if I try to be\nhonest about motives for doing\nthis sort of work, they would\ninclude the general re quir ment of\nearning a living; the prestige of\nworking at Imperial; the security\nof employment( relatively speaking) in the public service;\nthe occasional reward of knowing that one has done something\nof value; and a vague awareness\nthat it's what I'm best at. They\nwould not include an impulse to\nmanipulate or exercise power\nover people, indeed, since I'm immensely sensitive to manipulation myself, I systemic ally err on the side of caution.\nHowever, having said that, it\nremains true that counselling is\nrooted in a relationship, albeit a professional one, and involves a degree of open-ness, trust and\ncommitment. The counsellor carries the responsibility for\nsetting the scene, as it were; but\nthe final responsibility is a reciprocal one, and as in any\nother sort of relationship, nothing fruitful is likely to spring\nfrom it if one of the parties remains entrenched behind his\ndefences.\nEssentially, I think I'm running\na casualty service for students\nfor whom things have gone wrong, at least temporarily, and\nwho have come to the point\nwhere they feel there is merit in\ntalking to someone on whom they have a mandatory right to\nmake demands, and in the\nknowledge that what is discussed is confidential, and will\nhave no repercussions beyond\nthe walls of my office, unless the\nstudent chooses to initiate them.\nAnd when things do go wrong\nfor a student, that tends to be\nserious, not because students\nhave more, or worse, problems\nthan other people, but because\nof the peculiar nature of their\noccupation, ie, structured and\nsustained learning. The high level\nof intellectual efficiency demanded of a student is impaired\nby anxiety and distress \u2014\nwhatever its origin, and gives a certain urgency to the need for\nintervention, for breaking into\nthe disastrous cycle at an early\nstage.\nYou will find details of my\nwhereabouts on posters around\nthe college, and in the internal\ntelephone directory. My internal\nphone number is 4205.\nDON ADLINGTON\n10\n\n"

And other bits and pieces.\nAs you may remember, we had an accommodation survey, the results of\nwhich will be published later. At the\nCollege-organised seminar on accommodation many topics were broached but there\nwere very few conclusions (ie, none).\nOne idea was that of a 'satellite' community,\nbig enough to command its own social\nlife, sited within easy access but in a cheaper area, this is as well as using the\nWest and North Kensington areas (which\nare relatively cheaper). Shared triples come out very low on the top 20 pops\nand rent levels will probably reflect this\nnext year.\nGUILDS OLD CENTRAL!ANS' AWARDS\nAM Holbein Memorial Award\nThe Old Centralians will once again be\nmaking this award to the Guildsperson\nwho best fits the following three criteria:\ni) Someone who has proved themselves as an enthusiastic and able\nsportsman for Guilds (rather than\nIC or UL). ii) Socially enthusiastic and well-liked.\niii) An active Union member( but\npreferably not on the Exec).\nEach nomination should be supported by\na written recommendation of about two\nhundred words and should reach Jo Armitage, C&G President, by 2nd May. Further details are available from the Guilds\nUnion Office. All nominations will be treated\nin the strictest confidence.\nHolbein Travel Scholarship 1980\nThe Old Centralians Trust will award a travel scholarship to a value of \u00a3100 to\nenable undergraduates of the City and\nGuilds College to undertake a study project\nabroad during the summer vacation of 1980.\nA copy of the conditions of award can be\nobtained from the Guilds Union Office. All applications must be summit ted not later\nthan 16th May. On the subject of rents, discussion on\nnext year's rent levels opened last week\nin the Residence Finance Sub-committee.\nThis has proposed a fairly massive increase in Hall and House rents to the\nmain committee. I have proposed another\nset of rises which, though smaller, is still\nby economic necessity (ie, the account\nhas to break even), fairly large. The jump\nis made larger by the fact that the mid-session rise was averted, (ie, though a deficit budget was avoided the account\nreally ran at a loss). Also, the Evelyn Gardens lease purchase repayments account for an enormous figure. Finally,\nthe weightings have been changed so that\nthe less salubrious rooms (triples, etc)\nhave much lower percentage increases.\nI will keep you informed as the discussions\nprogress and will be more specific next\nweek.\nAs to the WU S/IC Third World Scholarship the student side has raised \u00a31,200.\nSpecial congratulations must go to Fiona Sinclair, John Whitehouse and the other\nbadge sellers. The Indian Embassy responded with a \u00a350 cheque to the letter\nI sent to every embassy, but only a disappointing \u00a3400 has come from the\nstaff.

    "content": "The World University Service (WUS) is a non-governmental,\nuniversity organisation made up of staff and students on\ncampuses in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe. The basic\nprinciples behind the movement are: resistance to all\ninfringements of freedom of thought and expression in all areas of\nlife; opposition to all forms of discrimination, exploitation and\ninjustice and the promotion of university involvement alongside\ntheir basic problems. These aims are pursued with particular\nvigour in the education world, in study, research and teaching.\nNaturally such a body strongly promotes and supports\n' democratic decision-making.\nSuch high ideals are most laudable, but what does WU S achieve in practise? WU S( UK) is the British committee of the\norganisation and has educational charity status; for more than\nfifty years it has helped many of the casualties of repression,\nparticularly refugees. The work in this area is one of the main\nreasons why Britain is still regarded as a haven for refugees and\"\nan up holder of free thought and free speech. In recent years the\nmovement has been trying to improve awareness in Britain of\nsocial and economic issues in the world, and has done this\nthrough projects in universities and colleges. In this way links\nhave been built between British academics and their counterparts\nin Third World countries; likewise contacts have been made with\nvillages, schools, grass-root groups and individuals, which will\nhopefully lead to mutual understanding as well as any tangible\nresults.\nMuch of this activity has been done through the student union\nmovement. WU S( UK) has seventy-six affiliated unions and many\nothers participate in fundraising and project work. ICU is, of\ncourse, an affiliate of WUS(UK) and also takes an active part in\nthe Third World scholarship campaign; by means of this a Third\nWorld student of suitable academic standing, and who would not\nnormally be able (for financial or other reasons) to come to IC, is\nenabled to do so. The student, who should be doing a course\nrelevant to his country's needs, has his fees waived by College\nand his living expenses made up by student contributions. This\nmoney comes from the voluntary fifty pence donations at\nregistration at the start of each year, from the proceeds of badge-selling and from a voluntary collection during the distribution of\nFELIX (5p per copy) on Friday 9th May.\nIn the past, WUS(UK) has been (and still is to some extent)\nheavily dependent on finance from the government, in particular\nthe Overseas Development Administration. WUS(UK) expects a sharp decline in income from such sources and has already begun\nthe search for alternative funds. The immediate effect of the\ncutbacks is that WU S Is now less dependent on government\nmoney. While this has lead to a reduction in the number of WU S scholarships being offered, it has given W USa chance to reexamine its work and motives. Among the questions considered\nat the last WU S conference was the important point of whether it\nis wise to educate Third World students in high (and expensive)\ntechnology and science when perhaps more relevant courses\nshould be given in their own countries. Also discussed were the\ndecisions and attitudes of the present government and the\neffects of higher fees; the most serious consequence is that\nalthough overseas students numbers will remain steady, the\nnumber from the poorer nations will be greatly reduced.\nA most difficult problem at present for WU S, student unions\nand colleges at present is the Department of Education and\nScience. This body seems to delight in delaying decisions until\nafter the event and seems to have no broad policy, relying on\nprecedent for decision-making. Mind you, this quirk may be a political tactic. After all, it is difficult to attack and oppose nonexistent policy.\nThere is no doubt that WU S will continue to play an important\npart in education and the promotion of contact between\nindividuals and small groups of different countries. ICU has a part\nto play in this. So have you. Please donate generously on Friday\n9th May.\nTim Hillyer\n\"Hello wall. Did you have a good day today?

    "content": "Young people are not always sold\nthe right life policies and sometimes\nthey are sold policies which they\ndo not need. This warning comes\nfrom National Westminster Insurance Services, the insurance\nbro king arm of the National\nWestminster Bank, one of the\nlargest life assurance brokerages\nin the country.\nA spokesman explained that, while\nprotection type cover is very cheap for\nyoung people, few actually need a large\ncapital sum payable on their death as\nthey have no dependants. So far as\nsavings type policies were concerned, it\nwas admittedly an attractive proposition\nto take out a plan at a young age with tax\nrelief and look forward to a useful tax-free\nlump sum in the late twenties or early\nthirties when a decent car or other major\ninvestments might be contemplated. However, in many cases a student's resources are stretched and long term\nsavings through life assurance is just not\na top priority.\nIncidentally, if the main aim is future\nhouse purchase, National Westminster would normally suggest a regular savings\nplan with a building society, possibly accompanied by an inexpensive flexible\nlife policy.\nUnit linked plans do not usually provide\nsuch a high level of guarantees as traditional with profits contracts and are\nonly normally recommended by the Bank in combination with other contracts for\npeople who have reasonable resources or\nwhere the accumulation period is long\nand the customer really does appreciate\nthe nature of the contract.\nIf the idea of taking a slightly higher\nrisk in exchange for a possibly (but not\ncertainly) better result has appeal (and\nnot all advisers would agree that this is\nthe right type of contract for the first\ntime investor) make certain you are dealing with a well established company\nwith evidence of management expertise\nand a track record.\nNon profit type savings contracts and\nsome savings contracts which provide numerous options most of which on close\ninspection are unlikely to be used (but will\nbe paid for!) also tend to be either unsuitable for young people or poor value.\nWhilst flexibility to vary the type of\nbenefits in line with changing circumstances\nis very useful and can be important, especially if you have an idea of how you i circumstances will change (for example,\nfirm intention to get married or the\nprobability that you will need to support\nageing parents) be wary of buying multi\npurpose plans for premiums which seem\nhigh in relation to your resources as you\nare likely to wind up with a package of\ncompromises none of which will offer top\nvalue.\nLife cover can, says National Westminster Insurance Services, be a tax efficient and profitable savings medium\nand it can also provide substantial tax\nfree funds on death. But, as a student\nlikely to be earning well above average in\nthe years to come you should recognise\nthat you are fair game for the aggressive\nsalesman. Therefore, get good advice from a well established specialist life\nbroker who enjoys a good reputation. A salesman selling only one company' s products has only a limited range of\ncontracts to offer you and while some\nmay be good it would be a bold company\nsalesman who could claim that his office\noffered top value for every type of\ncontract available.\nIf you do not know a good broker your\nlocal National Westminster Bank Manager\nwill be pleased to arrange professional\nadvice for you but remember:\n1. If you cannot afford \u00a35 a month before\ntax relief for a savings type plan your\npriorities probably lie elsewhere. However,\nless than this amount could buy you a policy\nwhich provides lots of cover payable on\ndeath only and a guarantee of future\nin sur ability which you may consider to be a low price to pay for peace of mind.\n2. If you are approached, or decide to seek\nadvice, have a clear idea of what you want\nfrom your plan - if you have only a hazy idea\nyou should probably wait until you are\nworking or just before you start and think\nseriously about the whole business then.\nTom Cottrell, Liason Officer for enquiries regarding all types of\nNational Westminster Bank Ltd at the insurance and he is located in the Sub\nCollege will be pleased to handle Branch, Level 1, Sherfield Building.\nInternal phone number 3168.\nRAG FETE 1980\nSaturday3 rd May Princes Gardens Stalls & helpers\nneeded\nSo j if you want to smash pianos, do a sponsored\nstreak around Princes Gardens or just bake a dozen\nfairy cakes\nGet in touch with Rae Snee (do IC Union Office), or\ncome along to the Rag Committee meeting at 7:00pm on Wednesday 30th April in the ICWA Lounge.\nWhether you run a stall or just help out on the day,\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!9 "

    "content": "Easter NUS Conference Report\nby IC's Unofficial Observer\nMany abbreviations have been used in this\narticle, so to clarify:\nLA = Left Alliance (nee Broad Left).\nComprised of some NO LS, some\nLiberals and the CP. The ruling group in\nNUS. Based on individual membership.\nCP= Official Communist Party. \"Tankies\".\nNO LS= National Organisation of\nLabour Students; many not in LA. ULS [ Union of Liberal Students; some\nLA, some not.\nFCS= Federation of Conservative\nStudents (those involved in student\nunions tend to be \"pink os\"). SSA [ Socialist Students' Alliance (once\nIMG).\nSWSO = Socialist Workers' Students\nOrganisation; even more left-wing\nTrotskyite group than SSA.\nElections\nPresident: Dave Aaronovitch (LA/CP)\nSecretary: Fiona MacTaggart (LA)\nTreasurer: Helen Connors (LA)\nVice Pres Welfare: Leighton Andrews\n(LA/ULS)\nVice Pres Education: Andy Pearmain\n(LA/CP).\nAll the above sabbatical.\nExec Officers: Chris Ham el Smith( Independent); Jane Taylor (LA); Hank\nHastings (SSA).\nExec Members: Chris Bones (FCS);\nMark Cassidy ( NO LS); Jan Nielsen\n(SWSO); Steve Reicher (SSA).\nExec Committee Members: Linda\nMiller (LA); Ann Henderson (SSA); Mark\nWooding (FCS); Paul Rees (SWSO); Alan\nWatson (NOLS).\nTwo interesting points about the elections:\n1. Having ensured the election of a Liberal\nsabbatical on the LA slate, many UL S members then voted for non-LA can di dates; Chris Hamel-Smith (an amazingly\nfunny speaker who stood as a joke\ncandidate for President both last year and\nthis) and Bob Greig, who narrowly failed\nto be elected as an Exec member.\n2. The ever-growing move by NO LS away\nfrom the LA; two of their dissident\ncandidates were elected, both at the\nexp mf ti ye of LA candidates.\nThe significance of the above points is\nthat the Broad Left/Left Alliance clique\nthat has controlled NUS Exec for years is\nno longer in a majority. It's not that\nFCS/ NO LS/ Trot coalitions are likely, but\nit's refreshing to see a broader spread of\nopinion.\nMotions\n1. Subscriptions. In my report of the\nChristmas conference I noted the urgent\nneed for a subs policy; the Exec had to\ncompromise with either FCS or the two\ntrot groups. The policy passed was a compromise with the Tories, which eases\nthe burden placed on the larger colleges\n(like IC if we were in).\n2. Priorities. Narrowly, and after very\nlengthy debate the National Union voted\nto begin to lose its 'rent a mob'( to quote\nthe Mail and Telegraph) image, and to\nconcentrate more on student related\nactivities. This also signals the demise of\nmuch of NUS's international work. In my\nopinion this is but a step in the right\ndirection. Had some contraction not been\naccepted however, NUS may well have\ngone bankrupt.\n3. Afghanistan, World Peace, Etc. The\nLiberal line was 'boycott'; the Tory line\nwas 'at the athletes' discretion', but the\npolicy passed was the CP's 'peace and\ndisarmament idea.\n4. Nuclear Power. All the debate was\nabout which anti-Nuke stance NUS should take (the guardedly pro-Nuke FCS Not having an amendment in). The best\nspeech however was Trevor (ex-IC)\nPhillips closing speech against the main\nmotion. He didn't quite swing the vote\nthrough.\n5. Grants. Here the main motion was an\nExec/ULU composite. The UL U part was\nbased on a London Grants paper drawn\nup by Bernard Smith, which was rejected\nhere, but was passed overwhelmingly at\nUL U.6. Northern Ireland. On the last day of\nconference (when many delegates had\nleft) the two Trot groups, passed policy in\nfavour of the 'Troops Out' line; something\nof a change from the established 'peace\nand jobs' policy.\nChris Webb\nI.C.
