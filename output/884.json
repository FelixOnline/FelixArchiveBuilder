    "content": "Save Energy Read this in the dark\ncontrol their breathing and heart rate at\nwill.\nThis article contains only a fraction of\nwhat is known about snakes. Nothing has\nbeen said about the diverse adaptions\nspecies have made for living in varied\nhabitats, but to give some idea, here are\nsome examples.\nThe most hostile habitats in the world\nare deserts. A well known desert snake\nspecies is the Side Winder, these move in\nthe peculiar fasion as their name suggests\nin order to not only gain a purchase on\nthe every shifting sand, but also to touch\nas little of this hot sand as possible.\nThere are extensive deserts in\nAustralia. One snake that lives here has a leaf like tail. It lies buried in the sand\nwith its tail exposed, attracting ants. The\nants attract lizards which the snake\ncatches and eats.\nAnother Australian snake is a green\ntree snake which lives in forest habitats.\nIt holds onto a branch with its tail and\nstretches itself out laterally, catching\nbirds, insects and even bats.\nSnakes are not very social animals, but\nwhen they do get together, they do so in\ntheir hundreds. Rattle snakes for example\ngather in caves and hibernate through\nthe winter, sharing each other's body\nheat.\nSnakes have equally wie rd and\nwonderful breeding habits. One of the\nwi erde st is the garter snake. The female\ngarter attracts the attention of several\nmales by exuding perfume (p here m one) as human females do, but a certain\nnumber of males mimic k her by exuding\ntheir own perfume. This attracts males\naway from her and the 'false female' goes\nand mates with her.\nMany snakes have ritual is ed mating\ndisplays. For example with the adder\nmales wrestle for females, doing what is\nknown as the adder dance, but they\nrarely bite each other for this would be\nfatal, too easy to do, and wastes venom. When it comes to laying eggs, different\nsnakes have different ideas on where to\nlay their eggs. Some snakes, eg vipers,\nkeep the eggs within their bodies and end\nup giving birth to live young. The grass\nsnake, on the other hand, decides it\nwants nothing to do with its children and\nends up laying its eggs in decaying\nvegetation and compost heaps where\nrotting plants and fungi give off heat.\nOther snakes, especially pythons, are\nvery motherly and wrap themselves\naround the eggs, occasionally twitching\ntheir muscles to generate body heat and\nincubate the eggs.\nSo you see, snakes are variable in their\nhabits and lifestyles and not a lot is\nknown about them. Perhaps by learning\nmore we may be able to way lay our fear\nof them.\nSustainability is the core of the Green\nParty's thinking and they bele ive that it is\nthe solution to our energy crisis, since the\nfossil fuels that we use currently are\nbound to run out sometime. It has been\nestimated that, at the present rate of\nconsumption, the UK coal reserves will\nonly last for another 54 years. Other\nfosse l fuels, as well as nuclear, are finite\nand so so or er or later all countries will\nhave to look for other so u ces of energy.\nAt the moment the UK has no set\nenergy policy. The Green Party bele ives that one should set be up which includes.\n1. Care about future generations.\n2. Care about other populations.\n3. Ensure equal availability of fuels to all\nnations.\n4. Improve the amenity of our own population.\nHowever, saying something is needed\ndoes not necessarily mean that it will be\nincorporated into a countries policy. This\nis because policies are always connected\nto politics and every government prefers\nto act is such a way as to ensure its own popularity in the short run. This was\nevident three weeks ago during the\nsecond World Climate Conference in\nGeneva. More than 130 countries agreed\nto work on drawing up an in tere national convention to deal with global warming.\nUnfortunately specific international\ntargets for the reduction in carbon\ndioxide emissions were not set as the\nministers could not agree on a level. This\nis not surprising since each minister has\nto look after his/her own counties\ninterests. And so with the privatisation of\nthe 12 regional electricity companies on\nthe 5th of December, Mr Chris Patten\n(Enviromental Secretary) could not afford\nto agree to tough emission controls which\nwould make the electrical companies look\nunfavourable to potential share holders.\nThis is the kind of thinking that needs to\nbe replaced by a more long-term attitude\nof looking into the future by 50 or even\n500 years.\nWith regards to the world's population;\nthe future holds a rapid increase which\nwill result in an upsurge in the demand\nfor energy. Developing countries will\nwant to ache ive the high standard of\nliving of their western counterparts and\nso will increase their energy cons up tion. I do not think that anyone has any\nobjections to people increasing their\nstandard of living, but the question is, can\nthe world afford this with regards to its\nenergy resources? Consider our current\nmethods of energy production and the\nanswer is NO. In the case of fossil fuels\nthe damage done to the climate from\nvarious emissions is the main obstacle,\nwhereas with nuclear power the waste\nproduced is the main problem.\nSo, what are the options? Well, for one\nthing energy loss can be reduced so that\nwe can make the most of what we have\nnow. Energy eff ice n cy can be improved\nboth in industry and in the home. Houses\ncan be designed with energy conservation\nin mind; and even the insides of our\nhomes can be made more eff i cent. The\nuse of low energy bulbs saves 80% of the\nenergy a normal bulb would use.\nIn industry taxes and incentives can be\nused to encourage a move towards low energy systems and products at suitable\nmarket prices. Transport and agriculture\ncan also be made more ene gy eff i cent. In\nthe case of transport it should be stressed\nthat accessibility is more important the\nmobility, and public transport should be\nimproved to such a level as to decrease\nthe need for private cars without loss of\namenity. With agriculture energy can be\nsaved by decreasing the distance of\ndistribution as well as making the actual\nfarming methods less intensive.\nAs well as increasing energy eff ice n cy we need to gradually phase out fossil\nfuels. Eastern European countries are\nalready facing a decrease in the amount\nof oil available to them (because of a double oil shock, resulting from the\nincrease in the price of oil and the\nremoval of Soviet oil). A similar situ i ation will have to be faced by many countries\nin 30 years time when when fossil fuels\nbecome scares. For the pah s eing out\nprocess natural gas can take the place of\noil, coal and nuclear fuels. This is because\nthe emissions from natural gas are 6\ntimes less than those for coal.\nThe rest or our energy demands will\nhave to be met by renewable reso u ces such as: solar, wind, wave, biomass and\ngeothermal. So far because of the heavy\ninvestment into nuclear power renewable\nresources have largely been ignored. But\nthey are bound to become important in\nthe near future, as even the g oven ment agree that renewable resources can meet\n20% of the national energy needs. The\ntechnology is available but without\ngovern man tal action and public pressure\nthe move to renewable resources will be\nslow, and time is of the essence.\nTherefore developed con tries need to\nreview their energy production systems\nand consider more eff i cent alternatives, in\norder to set an example for the\ndeveloping countries hoping to follow in\ntheir footsteps.\nShadi Khoroushi\n11\n\n"

    "content": "41\nIN I4kh M\\ HIM \u00ab Al \u00a3 l am ir~ Red Lion Appears Overnight\nLate on Tuesday evening, a student\nreported that somebody had painted red\none of the two lions outside the entrance\nto the Queen's tower. The deed took\nplace between 7.00pm and 1 l. OOpm.-Distressed ICU Hon Sec, Murray\nWilliamson, was asked whether he knew\nanything about it. He had spotted the\nwords 'Reggii' on the base, and a red\n'KCR' on the door nearby, and assumed\nthat King's College were responsible.\nBen Turner, Union Deputy President,\nthought the prank was funny as the\nUnion will not have to pay for it.\nThe vandals used a red vinyl emulsion\npaint to coat the lion. It was removed on\nWednesday afternoon using a high\npressure water hose and de-emulsifier.\nBrad Swan, General Expenses and\nTravel (College), said that the cost for\ncleaning will be between \u00a3 2 0 0 and \u00a3230.\nA similar incident happened five years\nago, when both lions were painted. The\nbill then, for sand blasting, was in the\nregion of \u00a3400.\nCleaning was performed by 'European\nSpecialist Cleaning', the same company\nthat cleaned the lions previously. One of\nthe men doing the work said that it was\n'quite a job' to clean. Geoff Reeves, Chief\nSecurity Officer, said that 'if we have to\nsandblast the lions much more, we'll end\nup with a couple of bloody mice'.\nNo-one could say whether the College is\ninsured against vandalism, most security\nbeing concerned with patrolling inside\nand not outside the buildings.\nChris Turner, King's College Union\nSocieties and Services sabbatical, admitted\nthat 'it seems to be the work of King's'. He said that there was no rag raid\nplanned and that 'rag is not until next\nterm'. He suggested that it was 'a few\npeople who got pissed and went a bit\nover the top'.\nLSE Drops Fees\nThe London School of Economics (LSE)\nhas dropped its plans to charge tuition\nfees. Students would have been charged\nan amount above the mandatory grant to\ncover rising costs.\nUniversity College London (UCL) still\nhas plans to introduce tuition fees for\nLaw and Medicine, their two most sought\nafter courses, and discussions on fees are\ncertainly on Imperial's agenda.\nThe Provost of UCL believes that\nintroducing fees will not reduce the\nReggie\nResigns\nReggie Blennerhassett, the Union Finance\nOfficer, resigned yesterday. He will be\ntaking up the post of Deputy Finance\nOfficer at the Royal Veterinary College in\nCamden from the 1st January 1991.\nReggie joined the Union in January\n1988 and started to sort out the Snack\nBar accounts. Since then he has moved\nonto clubs and societies, reducing the\nwork of the auditors each year and\nallowing clubs to sort themselves out\nfinancially. He will be sorely missed by\nthe Union. Soon after Reggie's resignation, Margaret Thatcher threw in\nthe towel herself.\nnumber of applicants for the two courses.\nThis could also apply to some of\nImperial's over subscribed courses.\nThe action by LSE puts more\" pressure\non UCL to drop their plans, a move that\nwould please the students' union there as\nthey have stated that they will encourage\nprospective students to apply elsewhere if\nfees are introduced.\nBenjamin Turner, Union Deputy\nPresident, said that dropping plans for\nfees was 'a bloody good move.'\nCorrection\nTonight's Guilds Carnival will cost \u00a3 5 on\nthe door. Bring your Union Cards. 'This is\nstraight from the horses' mouth' said\nLucia.\nIC Rag in\nA storm has blown up this week between\nIC Rag and Cardiff's 'Rag Caerdydd'.\nThere has been bad feeling building up\nfor some time and it came to a head last\nFriday when a letter received by FELIX\nwas released to Steve Farrant, IC Rag\nChairman. Written by Sue Bourne from\nCardiff, it contained allegations against IC\nRag and the Rag Executive in particular.\nThe most worrying aspect of the letter\nSecurity\nLast Friday saw another cycle coding\nsession, run by college security to try to\nreduce the large number of bicycle thefts\nthat occur around the college. Mr Brilley,\nSecurity Officer, said that there had been \u2022\n'a very good response, we're very\npleased.' 130 people had brought items in\nto be coded.\nTwo cycles that had not been coded\nwere stolen on Tuesday, one from outside\nthe Science Museum, the other from\noutside Huxley. Mr Brilley complained\nthat neither had been fitted with D locks\nand that chains are not strong enough to\nsecure bicycles.\nMr Brilley added that any loss should\nbe reported to him on internal 3370. This\nincludes items stolen from halls of\nresidence since insurance claims, which\nmust be assessed by security, should be\nbacked up with a report of the theft.\nDispute\nare suggestions of dishonesty and theft\namongst the Exec, especially during the\nrecent Monopoly collection. Steve\nstrongly believes that if theft did occur it\nwas not the fault of 1C Rag members. He\nsuggests that the organisers, Mencap did\nnot take adequate security measures.\nThere is not enough space to cover the\nmatter fully, but the complete story will\nbe covered next week.\n2\n\n"

They are no more\nresponsible for the atrocities of their\nimperialistic war of expansion than are\nthe current German people for the events\nfrom 1939 to 1945.\nMr Bailey, who like all people of a similar twisted mind (it is reported that he\nhas sported a 'Hang Nelson Mandela' Tshirt) obviously doesn't know his facts.\nDuring the Pacific War in Japan the\npolicy of the war was dictated by a handful of fanatical militarists (names\nsupplied on request, not that Mr Bailey\nwould recognise them) who revered the\nEmperor as a god (a little like Mr Bailey\nand the war vets) and firmly believed the\nmythical desc en sion of Japan and the\nEmperor from the sun god Amatarsu,\nthus justifying the expansive policies of\nthe post-Meiji restoration period.\nThe population was deceived in a big\nway. This is not a uniquely Japanese\nphenomenon, how else can you explain\nthree consecutive Tory governments. The effects of the war on the Japanese people\nwere horrendous. It is salient to\nremember that at the time most of Japan\nwas starving and there was a lot of\nopposition to the endless war perpetuated\nby the militarists and the Zaibetsu (large\nconglomerate companies who were\nmaking a fortune out of the war).

The Americans, who occupied and rebuilt\nJapan (destroying a lot of traditional\nculture that far surpasses much of the\nWest), were received gratefully as they\nremoved the leaders who had caused the\nwar. Hirohito's part in this has never\nbeen proven and is indeed unlikely as he\nwas known to hold Marine Biology above\nmost things, and was probably not able to\nexercise real power as he was a purely\nfigurative monarch after the Meiji\nRestoration of the 19th Century and thus\nheld little or no actual power.\nThe refusal to let these things lie down\n(they should never be forgotten but can\nbe forgiven) is unbelievably\ncounterproductive for closer world\ncooperation\u2014this obviously would not\nbother Mr Bailey as he does not live in\nthe real world anyway. The Japanese are\nno longer our enemies\u2014they are just\nmore successful in rebuilding their\neconomy (13th place in the per capita\nincomes in 1971, 1st or 2 nd now; top ten\nlargest world banks are Japanese; Japan\nis the biggest creditor nation with a huge\nbudget surplus) and have meticulous\nattention to detail. They are possibly the\nbest educated nation in the world (94%\ncomplete up to High School level), most\nliterate and have great stability in their\ncountry.

    "content": "Sugoto Ray explores the world of snakes from\nHissing Sid to Kaa...\nTrust in Me\nSnakes are either the object of intense\nfear or obsessive f as c in tion, and there are\nmany myths and remarkable facts\nsurrounding these mystical serpents.\nTo begin with snakes aren't just legless\nlizards. Lizards are reptiles with earholes\nand eyelids, snakes are reptiles without.\nThere are two major types of snakes,\nve nemo us and non-ve nemo us. Let's begin\nwith the poisonous type.\nThese snakes have poisonous spit, ie\nvenom, which they can either inject with\nhollow teeth (fangs) or spit with water\npistol like teeth, as with the spitting\ncobra. These can spit in your eye from a distance of up to twelve feet.\nVenom itself is a very variable\nsubstance. In some species it acts as a digestive enzyme, so any unfortunate\nanimal which has been bitten and yet\nmanages to escape soon finds that it is\nslowly being digested anyway, by which\ntime the snake has caught up with it and\nproceeds to swallow it head first and\nfinish the process.\nOther venoms act as blood clotting\nagents or para ly sing neurotoxins so any\nbitten animal which tries to escape soon\nslows down and goes into a spasm, while\nthe snake catches up with it and swallows\nit in the preferred, streamline, head first\nposition.\nVenemous snakes have many\nphysiological adaptions to suit their mode\nof living. Although snakes cannot hear,\nthey can feel vibrations on the ground,\nwarning them of approaching prey or\nenemies, and of course snakes have that\nfamous forked tongue.\nThis flickering organ collects particles\nfrom the air and takes them into a specialised taste organ, the jacobson s organ, giving the animal a very enhanced\nsense of smell. Another snake speciality is\nthe ability to sense infra-red heat\nradiation from warm blooded animals.\nThis is done via two facial heat sensing\npits, so any rodent (the preferred prey of\nve nemo us snakes) which thinks it is safe\nsimply because it is dark, or because it is\nin a dark burrow, is sadly mistaken. By 'smelling' it and feeling its body heat our\nreptile friend can trace its movements\nand follow it.\nVenemous snakes are fear d by most of\nthe human race. They move very fast\nand their bites are often fatal, but,\nalthough they deserve respect, such fear\nis unjustified. Venom is a precious\ncommodity, made in small amount. Any snake on confrontation will rear up, hiss\nand generally make a lot of noise, (as\nwith the rattle snake). They try to scare\noff enemies with false strikes, rather than\nwaste the venom on which their life\ndepends.\nVenemous snakes aren't generally very\nlong, and although King Cobras can grow\nup to twenty feet long, six to twelve feet\nis the norm. Often the venom has very\nlittle effect on humans anyway. It is a fact that in Britain, more people die from\nbee stings than adder bites. If you are\nbitten by an adder you should feel no\napparent illness apart from occasional\nbouts of mild fever, which can be cured\nby taking anti his to mine tablets (hay fever\npills). Bites from more poisonous species\nare often treatable in a variety of ways.\nThe latest findings show that high voltage\nelectrical shocks can be used to treat\nsnake bite victims, although so far, three\npeople have died from the shocks\nanyway.\nBites from tropical snakes generally\nsixty years or more. They can take large\nprey but there are no known examples of\nadult humans every being eaten, and,\nalthough on dissection, small children\nhave been found in their guts, larger\nconstrictors don't usually eat animals\nlarger than wild pigs, small antelopes and\nbirds. Anacondas however have been\nknown to eat six foot cay mens, an\namazonian crocodile species.\nThere are no records of snakes eating\nvegetable matter, although some pythons\nare believed to supplement their diet with\nrotting fruit and there are claims that an\nIndian cobra species succ les on milk from\ncattle.\nThere are many remarkable facts\nneed to be treated very quickly if death\nis to be avoided.\nThe other types of snakes are\nconstrictors. These rapidly wrap\nthemselves intimately around prey, and,\ncontrary to popular belief, kill by\nsuffocating lungs rather than crushing.\nWhat happens is this; the prey animals\nin advert ant ly steps on a constrictor which is often hidden in leaf litter on jungle\nfloors. The snake wraps itself around the\nanimal, concentrating as we humans do,\non the thorax. The prey then runs out of\nbreath and breathes out, and the snake\ncoils tighter preventing breathing in.\nWhen the animal dies, the snake squashes\nit into a nice shape and swallows head\nfirst. Constrictors are generally slow\nmoving, although the initial wrapping is\nvery fast. These snakes are generally\nmuch fatter and longer than ve nemo us varieties. Boa constrictors, rock pythons\nand anacondas for example have been\nknown to grow to thirty feet long, have a girth of twenty six inches, and live for\nsurrounding snakes. For example, snakes\nswallow prey several times the size of\ntheir head. This is because they can\ndislocate their jaws, a phenomenon used\nby the egg eating snake which swallows\nwhole eggs to be eaten. This is equivalent\nto humans swallowing basketballs. On swallowing, spines lining the snake's gut\nremove the shell which is later ejected as\na neat package.\nBecause snakes swallow their prey\nwhole, a meal takes a long time to digest,\nand there are records of pythons not\nhaving to eat for up to nine months.\nSeveral species of snake can go without\ndrinking for months on end. This is due\nto the fact that the faeces is dry and\nsnakes do not urinate or sweat (hence\ntheir dry skin). The only water they lose\nis when they breathe. Desert species even\nhave specialised breathing apparatus\nwhich collects the moisture from their\nbreath and from the air, preventing water\nloss as well as providing water. Some\npython species are believed to be able to\n10\n\n"

From now on\nthe Union Bar will close at 11pm after\nwhich time the Snack Bar side bar will\nremain open until closure.\nIn the past we have got annoyed with\npeople gaining entry to a gig without\npaying by way of having a smudge on\nthe back of their hand. To overcome this\nwe have invested in a complete Ultra\nViolet ('Black Light') entry system, which\nis almost in fall able if it all works to plan.\nThe kit is available for hire using your\nown stamp. The first real test of these\nnew measures will be at tonight's Carnival, so be warned.\nOn Wednesday nights as part of the\nLibido Ents disco (which is free), the bar\nwill be open until midnight but as part of\nthe evening there will be cheap beer\npromotions, eg Castlemaine XXXX for\n50pa \u00bbpint.\nWe have also planned events for the\nbar.

    "content": "Blue Steel I Guns are the central theme of this\nfilm; guns and shooting people.\nJamie Lee Curtis stars as Megan\nTurner, a recently graduated New York cop. ' Why would a beautiful woman like\nyou want to become a cop?' people ask,\n'Because 1 want to shoot people', she\nreplies. And indeed she does; on her first\nnight on the beat she shoots and kills an\narmed robber who is holding up a supermarket.\nUnfortunately the rubber's gun can't be\nfound afterwards and witnesses could not\ncor or borat e her story, so she ends up\nsuspended for shooting an apparently\nunarmed suspect. So where did the gun\ngo? Well, it was removed from the scene\nby Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver) a wealthy\ncommodity broker, who was doing his\nshopping when it all happened. So\nimpressed was he by Turner's shooting\ndown of the robber that he was inspired\nto become ap syco pathi c killer and\nswiped the gun for this purpose. He then\nscratches Megan's name on the cartridges\nand goes out and shoots someone point\nblank. The police and Megan are\nsomewhat perturbed to find her name on\nthe cartridge and the case is taken on by\nhomicide detective Nick Mann( Clancy\nBrown) who reluctantly takes Turner on\nas his deputy. At the same time Eugene\ncontrives a chance meeting with Megan\nand an affair begins. And so on and so\nforth.\nThis film, directed by Kathryn Bigelow,\nis a serious attempt at a 'realistic' thriller\nwith a fair bit of character development\nand all the violence shown is graphic and\noften gory. It certainly looks good but the\nplot lets it down. The idea that an\napparently clean-living, stockbroker could\nsink into madness so quickly and avoid\nthe law and bullets so effectively (apart\nGuards! Guards!\nI Following the cries of pain and\nanguish that followed my last\nreview of one of his books where 1\nslandered the great and holy Pratchett, I will start by saying that this book is\ncompletely, utterly and unequivocally\nreasonable.\nHis trend of taking old stories and\nchanging the characters, adding a little\nwit and sarcasm, and flogging the result\nto his undying devoted fans continues. He\nhas copied parts of The Hobbit and\nn umer able other fairy stories, and even\nimitated somebody else's sense of humour\nto come up with his latest masterpiece.\nWritten in a very Monty Python style\nsense of humour it is a easy book to get\nalong with, the characters are amazingly\nstupid and he produces what in some\nplaces is a very funny book. Unusually\nfor one of his books he's managed to get\na plot into the story, and even a little\nsuspense (whatever next, a 'real' book?)\nwhich all makes for a very pleasant read.\nFor me the best part is when the city\nguard are trying to kill a dragon by\nhitting it in the 'vulnerable s.'( doesn't that\nremind you of another book?) It's decided\nthat 'its a million-to-one chance, but it\nmight just work' so when somebody\nsuggests that the odds might be slightly\nbetter (the archer is using his lucky\narrow) they do every thing they can to\nmake the odds exactly a million-to-one.\nThis includes making him wear a stupid\nhat, blindfolding him and even making\nhim stand one-legged in a bowl of\ncustard.\nDefinitely an improvement over\n'Pyramids', although he could do a lot\nbetter. He's even made allowances for\nfirst time readers by explaining many of\nthe quirks and foibles of the world the\nstory is based in.\nHis fans will buy it and love it, others\nshould buy it and read it.\nIan Hodge( Mr Hodge is now being tortured by the\nreviews team branch of the Pratchett\nAppreciation Society\u2014Reviews Ed.)\n\u2014Book\n\u2014Film\n\u2014Comic/Graphics\nREVIEWS\n\u2022\nfrom the fact that Ron Silver looks like a psychopathic killer) is slightly\ni mpla usable. By the end Blue Steel becomes much the same as any other American cop\ndrama.

The Arts Week aims to broaden the\nhorizons and increase the awareness and\nexpressive ability of all IC students, as a con stra st to the very scientifically\ndominated environment, we live and\nwork in. For the first time this year, we are planning to hold two participation\norientated workshops on the Wednesday\nafternoons, opening and closing the week.\nThe first with a bias towards 'Rock' styles\nof music and the second, more biased\ntowards classical skills. Both will give an\ninformal opportunity to perform.\nThe Arts Week will be from the 23rd to\n30th January 1991, so ink the dates in\nyour diaries and watch this space for\nmore information and previews of the\ntalent.\nOrienteering\nThis year the November Classic was held\nin the New Forest, fortunately it was the\nsame area as the U AU back in Easter.\nThis time the weather was against us. We ran through mud and swamp in an\nattempt to gain the shortest time, only to\nbe just out-classed. Tome gained a3rd in\nthe women's U21, Jermy Tomge managed\nvalient ly to come in 4th position in the\nmen's194. The Cambridge Sprinto was held in\nEpping Forest this year for some strange\nreason. As usual we all started off\ntogether in a circle to complete the\nfamiliar figure of eight. After much\nfighting with the wilderness, Tome\nreturned to find she was 7th and through\nto the next round where she was beaten.\nHans Ruhyn came very close to a position in the mens B Final.\nNorthamptonshire\u2014Churchill Cup '90.\nThe fog gie Autumnal morning gave way\nto a bright afternoon as we left London\nfor Northampton. The area we used was\njust outside a small village with a friendly\npub. We all ran hard in an attempt to\nbeat Birmingham and Aston Universities\nbut were well beaten on the day. Only\nTome managed anything like a fine run\nand achieved a4 th place in the womens\nevent.\nSplot Soc\nAt 7.30am on Saturday November 10 an\nassortment of cam o clad warriors met\noutside Beit, much to the concern of the\npolice. At10.30 we arrived at Finmere,\nnear Oxford. This is a Survival Game site\nand hosted the 1990 European\nChampionships. For the 'Virgin'\npaintball ers it was to be a baptism of fire\nas this was one of the best woodland sites\nwe have seen.\nThe group was split into orange and\nyellow teams and the games commenced.\nThe first game was won to Orange but\nthe second drawn. Game 3\u2014'Mercenaries'.\nHere an independent 'blue' team\nw re a cke d havoc, while the yellows and\noranges attempted to play a normal flag\ngame. Yellow win.\nGame 4\u2014'Spies'. Normal flag game but\nwith undercover team members trying to\ncause as much confusion as possible.\nOrange win due to severe depletion of\nyellow team by the Dynamic Duo, Lester\nand Leo.\nGames 5 & 6\u2014'Fort'. Both games were\nwon by the defending team; although the\nfort was severely 'rede crated'. Game 7 & 8\u2014'Speedball'. This was\nplayed in a50 yard netted square, behind\nplastic water putts, in the open. The\ngames were fast, furious, expensive and\nchaotic, with targets clearly visible and\npeople leaving the field every other\nsecond. 1st game to oranges, 2nd game\nto yellows.\nGame 9\u2014'Topgun'. Played in the\ngathering dusk and worsening rain, this\ngame redefines the word paranoia. It's all\nagainst all, the winner being the person\nwho bags most of the others. Winners\nwill say its down to skill, stealth and\naccuracy (well done Steve Halleyard). It's my opinion that it's blind luck.\nAnd so the games concluded with\nOrange victory, due mainly to the success\nof the yellow spies. Outstanding\nperformances included all the Flag\nGrabbers, all you people who zeroed a 'big gun' and everyone who had a good\ntime.\nCanoeing Report\nICCC took off on its second 'beginners\nweekend' at 7 o 'clock on Friday\nNovember 9. Our destination was a school field course centre somewhere\nnear the Brecon Beacons, which we\nreached after five hours of fog-bound\nspeeding and one memorable emergency\nstop.\nOn arrival we discovered that the key\nwas probably still stuck in a jam on the\nM4 and so we called upon one of our\nmore flexible members to invert himself\nthrough a small top window. This\naccomplished, we entered and found we\nwere to spend the weekend in\nremarkable luxury.\nMost of Saturday was a disappointment\nas we shuttled to and fro in search of a peaceful stretch of water away from the\nfarmers and busybodies who had so far\nfoiled any attempts on our part to use\nour equipment, and who succeeded in\ninfuriating most of our negotiators, the\nmost experienced canoeists.\nIt was late once the canoes did contact\nwater, and half an hour later it was dark,\nprecluding any further outdoor activities\non our part.\nMidday saw us on the River Ithon,\ntributary of the Upper Wye and the first\nbit of real action for most of the starters.\nThe trip was spent mostly on slow\nflowing peaceful waters amidst idyllic\nscenery and colourful wildlife, with the\nodd 'beginners' rapid' during which\nmultiple pile-ups happened.\nThe river stretched on and on and on,\nand by dusk, the pick up point had not\nyet been reached. The first group,\ncontaining one beginner, had to brave an\nunexpected rapid, more severe than\nbefore, in bad light, and the leaders\ndecided it was too risky to continue.\nDespite numerous blisters, several\nsoakings, exhaustion and mild\nhypothermia, all the beginners enjoyed it\nand will be back. For the pros', well they\nfound it a bit tame.\n\n"

    "content": "x orci st III\nREVIEWS\n(This is the official sequel to The\nExorcist, which naturally enough\n'makes it the third in the series.\nIgnore the second as it is an enormous\nturkey which gobbles at anyone who will\nlisten. This new film can also be called\n'Legion' for those of you who haven't lost\nus by now. Having said this, the film\npossesses (sorry) very little semblance to\nthe original ie. a distinct lack of\nswivelling heads, fluorescent vomit and\nLinda Blair. In her place is 'Patient X'( Jason Miller) who while not possessing\nthe flair for regurgitation of his illustrious\npredecessor has a nifty way with a syringe and an uncanny resemblance to\nFather Karras (the unfortunate exorcist\nfrom the first film). The word 'exorcism'\nis much too hard to spell and will\nhenceforth be replaced by the word 'poodle'.\nThe story revolves (sorry again) around\na series of HORRIFIC serial killings. These\ndastardly deeds (Muttley snigger) are\nperpetrated in the exact style of a killer\nwho fried crispy in the electric chair\nfifteen years ago, UNCANNILY close to\nthe first poodle.\nOur hunk y hero in this merry jaunt is\nFred FRED HRD REACHED CHAPTER TWO.\n'THE ART OF FOREPLAY'\nI As a graduate of the University of\nLife (where you go if you can't get\ninto UCL), Rupert Fawcett has\ncreated Fred, who, along with supporting\ncast tries to show a funny side to\neveryday life.\nThe cartoons range from the profound\nto the confusing, some are actually funny.\nThe style of single frame cartoons is not\nmy favourite, it is too dependent on your\nsense of humour. Indeed, many of the\npanels could not be described as funny,\njust odd, 'social comment' if you want to\nbe pretentious.\nThe quality of drawing is nothing\nspecial although this means very little as\nsome of the best cartoonists cannot draw\nvery well.\nA reasonable book but quite expensive\nat nearly \u00a3 5 , but maybe a good Christmas\npresent.\nIan Hodge.\nplayed by the indomitable George C. Scott who wavers between dis/belief and\nseems undeterred by the catalogue of\nVERITABLE ATROCITIES taking place\nunder his very nose (formidable organ\nthat it is). He is an honest bobby who has\na curious inability to notice grannies\ncrawling fly-like above his head. Our\ndoughty hero wades through a morass of\nconfused religious iconography with\ntroubled retrospection. Nothing very\nfrightening happens for an hour except\nPrisoner X claiming that he is not only\nresponsible but doubly possessed. George\nagrees.\nAt this point the film shifts into true\nwilly-trembling ly frightening mode with\none exceptionally unsettling sequence\n(details of which we will not give here).\nThis is the high point of the movie; after\nthis we are treated to rabid grannies and\ngarden shears; a priest turns up without\nvery much justification and attempts a quick poodle.\nTo sum up: this film features a very\ngood performance from the possessed\ngentleman in his solitary cell and most of\nthe violence is implied; the only gore is\nsaved for the climax. Very tense in places\nand very slack in others, but probably the\nbest horror movie around for some\nmonths. This said, it doesn't capture the\nspirit (sorry yet again) of the original.\nThere are no donkeys in this film.\nThis film is no way connected with\n'Repossessed' or any of its sequels.\nHonest.\nThe Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine\nHenry& June In the late summer of a1930's Paris\nbegins the true story of Henry and\nJune. The film follows the secret\ndesires of Anais N in and explores her\nrelationship with the writer Henry Miller\n(author of Tropic of Cancer). Anais has a passion for the erotic, unbeknown to her\never-loving husband, and spends much of\nthe film either having affairs or\nfanta s ising about sex in its many forms.\nHer most persistent obsession is that of\nJune. June is Henry's wife. Henry and she\nmet when she was a hostess in a sleazy\nbar, which covers much of her character,\nand have grown apart through her use of\na sugar daddy to support them while he\nwrote. June is both beautiful and\nmanipulative, using any method at her\ndisposal to gain what she desires. She\nwants to be written about, but Henry's work is too real and Anais's too poetic.\nHer changing moods and depth make her\nthe most interesting character and yet\nshe appears the least. By far the majority\nof the film is spent with Anais hopping\nbetween beds and saying that she feels so\ninnocent. Henry is a brash American who writes books that make DH Lawrence\nseem childish. He not so much woos\nAnais as takes her roughly after she,\nalmost timidly, seduces him. The result is\nmuch love making and her introduction\ninto the darker side of Paris with its\nprostitutes and pick pockets. The latter\nadd much needed humour and are purely\nsuperfluous.\nAs with Philip Kaufman's last film, The\nUnbearable Lightness of Being, the\ncinematography is superb and the setting\nis captured in full. However, the film is\nrather overlong, tends to be\nmelodramatic at times and overall lacks\npurpose. There is no 'torn between two\nlovers ' clich e with Anais rather enjoying\nhaving the separate attention of two very\ndifferent men (at least). This is the kind of\nfilm you leave feeling you've learnt\nsomething, but can't for the life of you\nremember what. Not big on good old\nfashioned entertainment or romance and\nit would be a bit of a disappointment for\nanyone purely after a hardcore sex\nmovie. One for the art crowd.\nThe Amazing Machine.\n\n"

IC found themselves\nhaving to defeat the elements as much as\nLSE. The Harlington howler made it\ndifficult for IC to play their composed\npassing game. Despite this IC swept into\nthe lead as A Jalan finished off a great\nmove. Defensive errors and missed\nchances saw the half-time score 2-1 to\nLSE. With the wind behind them, IC\nlevelled from aM Plummer spectacular,\nminutes into the second half. IC were\nnow camped in LSE's half who still\nmanaged to take the lead again.\nOpportunist goals from S Barry and A Jalan gave IC a deserved 4-3 lead. IC now dominated until the end when LSE defied\nthe odds and gods to force extra time.\nIC's extra class, fitness and determination\ntold in extra time. Simon Barry and his\nwooden leg dealt the killer blow just\nminutes before the need for penalties.\nLSE were left crying and IC were left\nbelieving 'Our name is on the Cup!'.\nFootball\nIC VI5 MUCH II-1\nIC 6th s had to wait for over an hour in\ncold and windy conditions for Middlesex\nand University College Hospital to\nsummon up the courage to face them. IC\nhad their biggest crowd of the season,\ninjured Dave Buckle escorted by two\nfemale admirers, and they were\ndetermined not to disappoint them. The\n6th s took command of the game\nimmediately but it was 20 minutes before\nRuban Ramachandran opened the scoring\nwith, unheard of in the 6th s, a header!\nThis was the sign for IC to do their usual\ndemolition job, goals from Dave Phillips,\nAndy Briscoe and Akio Iwase made it 4-0\nat half-time.\nThe second half saw Keith Cordeiro\nconsolidate the lead. However, without\nthe incredible skill and determination of\ntheir brilliant captain (substituted) IC\nallowed Middlesex a consolation goal a few mint u es from time. This win puts the\n6th s into the quarter finals of the UL U cup and increases their goal scoring\nrecord to 31 in only 5 games.\nWomen's Basketball\nOn Saturday November 17 the U AU tournament was held in Essex University.\nWe started off the day with seven players\nand one of which was injured. So one of\nour main players was out. The first game,\nagainst Sussex, was easy. It was nice\ngoing and we beat them by11 points.\nRight after this 40 minute game we had\nanother one against Kent. Unfortunately\nwe were so tired that we just couldn't keep up with them. We lost another\nplayer half-way through this game. So\nnow we had to be careful as we only had\nfive players left.\nOur third and last game was the\nhardest and we had to win it to go to the\nsemi-finals. During the whole game we were all nervous and uptight. Only five\nplayers so we couldn't lose any more. We scored one basket, they scored another\nand it was close all the way. At the last\nten seconds we were up by three points\nbut unfortunately they were able to score\na lucky three pointer. Time ended and\nwe were tired. We had five minutes\nextended time and managed to beat them\nby one basket. The day was long and\ntiring but we had the result that will take\nus to the semi-finals.\nUAU\nBadminton\nIC Mens l sts \u20148 Surrey Mens l sts \u20141\nIC Mens 2nds \u20149 Surrey Mens 2nds \u20140\nIC Ladies\u20144 Surrey Ladies\u20145\nWith LSE unable to produce a team this\nweek, IC pal ye d their last match to\ncomplete the round-robin. Of the three\nteams entered in the U AU championships\nIC Mens l sts and2 nds managed to merge\ngroup winners. Unluckily for the ladies\nthey failed by one game. 1st pair Wendy Tan and Uta Boltze gained two valuable\npoints. 2nd pair Emily F ok and Fiona\nGattely and 3rd pair Tracey Norman and\nClaire Roberts beat the weaker Surrey\n3rd pair for another two points. At four\ngames each our 3rd pair put up a good\nfight against Surrey 2nds before\nc once e ding a three-setter 11-15 in the\nrubber set.\nIC ladies now face the play-offs before\nbeing able to proceed into the next\nround. Good luck to all three teams in\nhaving a favourable draw.\nHockey\nICHC 3rd XI1 Kodak II-1\nSaturday saw the return of the 3rds annual brawl with Kodak. Much to our\nsurprise, the game was played in a good\nnatured manner, with no sending offs.\nThe game started well for IC, with the\nforwards ducking and diving with victory\ntheir only aim. Only luck saved Kodak\nfor c once e ding numerous goals, but a lucky Kodak breakaway saw them score\nwith about 20 minutes gone.\nThe second half was much the same\nand we were rewarded by Vic Parfitt\nputting away a text-book short corner,\nperfectly stopped by Matt Wong. Also\namusing was Marcus Hawkey's attempt to\nneuter himself, and Murray Holdsworth\nsmashed a player's son in the knee\nshortly after he came on at the end of\nthe game. Even more amazing was the\nfact that we played with only ten men,\nand another player would have led to a massive IC score.\nLadies'\nFootball\nIt all seems to be going horribly wrong\nfor the Dribblers this season. They just\ncan't take their beer anymore and\nthey've even started to win a few\nmatches. Old Tricia Bradley is turning in\nher grave. It all started with losing by only one goal to Kings with a43 result,\nbut then things got completely out of\nhand when the young Dribblers beat\nLondon Hospital 5-0. An unrelenting\nseries of brutal tackles by an ex-hockey\nplayer against the opposition's viking and\nthe Pele like skills of Mrs Lineker (Permy)\nsoon had the Dribblers on a path to\nvictory. Next to experience these new\nfound skills was the University of East\nAnglia. These yokels from the East were\ngob struck by the awesome talents of the\nDribblers which included a tremendous\nverbal performance between Mrs\nGascoigne (alias Nina) and a member of\nthe opposition with suspect tendencies.\nMrs Lineker scored her ac customary three goals and we jugged accordingly.\nNext it was off to play UCL with one\nplayer short and no Willie John in sight!!\nWell this was a game of two half s and\nthe girls done well with the defence\nbenefitting from the wisdom of the late\ngreat Lucy, a star of yesteryear, also\nfamous for her talent in obtaining minibus\nkeys. The girls got a result anyway of 1-1\nbut unfortunately were again not on form\nfor the boat race and the manager is now considering sending the team to a drink\nfarm for a weekend to remedy the\nsituation.\n\n"

Personally, 1 could\nnever partake in such an event which\nmakes men who fought in the Wars\nheroes and, in so doing, it glorifies the\ncause for which they died. These men\nwent away to kill fellow humans with\nguns, just as a lame horse might be put\ndown. But instead of the motive being\nsympathy, it was hatred and fear.\nOf all those people who lived and died\nin the Wars, we should remember those\nwho would not fight, all those 'cowards',\nafraid to die, and equally afraid to kill. To me the real cowards were those who\nsought for a solution in massacre and\nmayhem, all the while claiming that this\nwas what they fought to prevent.\nIt is common belief that the hardships\nand sufferings caused by the Wars is\njustified when the at tro cities of defeat are\nconsidered. Now we face the same\ndilemma in the Gulf. And every time\nthrough the ages when people have faced\nsuch problems 'fellow patriotic\ncountrymen' have gathered to fight and\nprotect their country, and their society. Is\nthis not proof enough that there is\nsomething fundamentally wrong with our\nsociety, or are patriotic causes the only\ntimes when murder may be permitted?\nWe allot ou selves territories, speak our\nown language, make our own laws, and\nwill readily dismiss another person for no\nbetter reason than that he lives within a Rock n Roll 7.00pm JCR.

Every\nDear Chris,\n1 had to do some research before\nwriting this letter in response to Alan Bailey's of Issue 883\u2014just in order to\ncheck that his letter was not a joke in the\npoorest of tastes. Unfortunately, having\nbeen informed that this particular\nindividual was well known for his poorly\ninformed, bigoted, ill-reasoned and\nxenophobic views and was therefore\nquite capable of writing this kind of\nignorant trash, I took up pen to write.\nThe pen, they say, is sharper than the\nSamurai sword.\nWhile I respect and am grateful for the\nsacrifices made by men and women to\ndefend Britain in two world wars and\nthus believe in the validity of a day of\nremembrance for them I cannot elevate\nthem to demi-god status as does Mr Bailey. War is not glorious, the people\nwho died in the wars while being brave\nand selfless were not heroes at all\u2014just\npeople unfortunate enough to have been\ncalled upon to fight\u2014I'm sure none of\nthem would have preferred fighting to\nother activities. At the Cenotaph, many\nhighly respected people were present\ngiving ample representation. People who\nrevere the sacrifices of war and constantly drag up the suffering and pain\nof these dreadful incidents are people,\nprobably much like Mr Bailey\u2014who was\nnot old enough to remember any of the\nhorrors of war (neither amI) and if called\nto fight would probably shit himself.

    "content": "On The Road\nFELIX talks to the\nband before\ndiscovering that life on\nthe road isn't all lager,\ngroupies and kebabs.\nPorl demonstrates how to\ndeal with groupies\u2014snarl\nAfter the sordid frenzy of the Electric\nBallroom, the masses were once again\nhypnotically beckoned to the entrancing\nsmoke. The dark hordes cramped into the\ntiny Trapdoor, tailored as ever to suit the\nclientele, as City University began to\nawaken. Then, briefly, as the many hands\nclasped for the light, the haze lifted to\nreveal Rosetta Stone, two lads from\nLiverpool and a drum machine with\nenough dry ice to rank their gigs as a serious threat to the environment.\nIn trepidation and awe, we approached\ntheir backstage sanctuary, only to be\nordered to take the piss out of them by\ntheir manager, Ray. The pair proved to\nbe instantly likeable, with Porl's talkative\nnature complimenting Karl's quietness.\n'We're both a bit shy really', so that's why they hide behind a veil of smoke.\n'No, 1 think people would get bored if\nthey could see us all the time.' However,\nit would be nice to be able to see them at\nleast some of the time!\nWhen the cloud does lift, it is almost\nshocking to discover that there are only\ntwo of them. Although he is modest,\nPorl's ability to perform intricate guitar\nmelodies and sing over them is as\nimpressive as their huge sound. In fact,\nthe only point they admit arguing over\nwas the choice of vocalist, as neither\nwanted to sing! The band is completed\nwith bassist Karl, whom any band would\nbe eager to employ. Obviously, they are\nslightly limited live by lack of numbers\nand so the music is simpler live than on\nvinyl, but by no means less enthralling.\n'We add more in the studio and make it\nbetter. You hear a lot of albums by new\nbands and think, 'Fuckin' 'ell, that could\nhave been a live gig.\"\nTheir music has been likened to early\nSisters and Mission, as they themselves\nadmit. 'It's not a rip-off, smiled Porl,\nguitarist and frontman. 'We're not the\nmost original band in the world, but\nthere's something there. The Sisters and\nMission and the like have all gone over\nto rock, so we're filling in the gap. The\nmain thing is that we're fans of the music\nwe play. Hopefully it will be our career.\nIt's either this or sitting at home on the\ndole watching telly.'\nHallowe'en Madness\nDrawn by some craving summons, the\nintrepid reviewers abandoned the security\nof London to head for Leicester for the\nAll Hallow's Eve Solemnization. This\nturned out to be at a pub bedecked with\nluminous tridents and bats. The tackiness\neven rivalled aTV game show. 'We try to\nbe down to earth. Some fans think that\nwhen they talk to us, we'll have an echo\non our voices. You've got to realise that\nyou're in the entertainment business and\nthat's it. We're not gods or anything.'\nAs for p retention and daunting titles,\n(eg, The Preachers of the New\nArmageddon), they are again only for\neffect, like the ominous smoke. 'Some\nplaces are so big, it's just like someone\nsmoking a fag in the corner.' Names such\nas Cimmerian, the name of the first vinyl\ntrack, is that of a mythical race of\nshadow dwellers, but it sounds good, 'a bit like a girl's name, We use a lot of\nreligious language, but we're not\nreligious. It's just the way we write. I used to be anti-religion, but now I don't care.'\nInevitably, the gig went triumphantly,\nas ever, and we were given our first view\nof The Ancestry, Rosetta's tour support.\nDescribed as a cross between Skeletal\nFamily and Lush, they again deserve to\ndo well.\nThe standing joke in Rosetta is their\ndrum machine. Not only was it offered\ncheaply, but turned out to be identical to\nDr. Avalanche, the Sisters' mean sounder.\nNot only this twist of fate, but their debut\nEP was recorded in studios frequented by\nThe Mission and was produced by their\nown Tim Palmer. They seem fated to\nfollow the trail of their music heroes.\n'We go out there for straightforward\nentertainment. We try to make our songs\nmore poppy and more accessible without\nselling out, just to get into the Top40. A song's got to be good enough to stand up\non it's own, so Joe Bloggs will hear it on\nthe radio and think, 'That's a good song,'\nnot 'They're a goth band, I'm not going\nto buy it.' The die-hard goths are\nprobably disappointed.'\nRosetta Stone have got the insight and\ndedication to make it huge, as Porl\npainstakingly explains how 'goth died a death', when the goth bands turned to\nrock and ended up in no- man's land\nwhere nobody wants to see them. As for\nthe current music scene, 'We ignore it.\nBands just chase after what's happening.\nOne band makes it then another takes\nover and the first is forgotten. No, I'm not\ngoing to slag it off - you'll quote me!'\nQuarriers\nRosetta's lack of p retention is further\nemphasised by the following, self\nchristened The Quarriers (Rosetta STONE,\ngroan). Apparently united by their\nsexiness, the multi colour gre bos are\ndedicated to following Rosetta's every\nmove, but revealed exclusively that they\nwere only after Porl's body. They are a charmingly raucous bunch of Tads' (even\nthe girls) from Worksop, Macclesfield,\nPreston and everywhere nice. Andrew Eldritch wanted to be a Quarrier but he\nwasn't 'ard enough.\nPorl admits they're the spokespersons,\n'the go-betweens in away because\nthey're more mouth y. The following's like dead important 'cos they've always\n1\n8\nRosetta Stone\nbeen there before the band are.' Yes, The\nQuarriers have been everywhere, it's quite astounding. Their song 'actions' are\nalso astounding, a farce only to be\nbelieved when seen. Chas' spider is also a keen fan and Mick 'can pull all't girls with\na big coat'. They're well'ard.\nThe 7 Year Hitch\nAnd so, with a genuine invitation to\nturn up any time, we ventured out into\nthe dark rain to attempt to travel the 130\nodd miles by the next evening. Twelve hours of wind, police patrols and\ncountless service stations later, we\nstaggered into Liverpool, Home Of The\nBeatles as every pub and poster seemed\nto shout. A little vandalism later, that was\nsoon put right to Home Of Rosetta Stone,\nby far the more prestigious of the two.\nThe bedraggled journ os collapsed onto\nthe doorstep, and there we may have\nremained as the code is four rings at the\ndoorbell. Eventually, an extremely\nsurprised Kim( 'the wife', and general\nlights and info person) let us in (poor\nfool). She turned out to be nicer than the\nproverbial Julianne Reagan, selflessly\noffering us tea, toast and the use of their\nvital crimp ers. Porl was out buying a new\ntoy, which later turned out to be \u00a3400\nworth of effects pedal.\nNeither have worked since leaving\nschool, trusting their music to pay the\nbills. Even their EP was released on their\nown label, financed by a friend's loan.\n'We knew it was good enough to pay it\nback,' grinned Porl, as the record ran to\na second pressing within days, advertised\nonly by word of mouth. They have just\nsigned, after much deliberation, and plan\nChas and his spider\nKarl narrowly avoids GBH with his bass\nfor a mini LP for the New Year.\nSo on to Liverpool Poly, the home gig\ndreaded so much. Rosetta Stone feel they\nare one of the most hated bands in\nLiverpool just because they have actually\nmade it out. They both admit that they\nwould indeed like to leave the city.\nDespite their trepidation, the turnout was\ngood but a mess over ticket sales meant\nthat they only just managed to break\neven.\nAfter another successful night, it was\nback for the traditional post-gig kebab\nand chips and breaking open of the\nStudent Welcome Packs so thoughtfully\nleft backstage for us. Back at the flat,\nanyone would have marvelled at what\nwild party had occured, with peanut\nbutter, Pot Noodles and M&M s strewn\nbetween the exhausted bodies of two\nbands and assorted fans trying to doze.\nThen, reluctantly, we were forced to\npart, to head back to the world of daily\nlectures and routine, so far removed from\nthe unpredictability of life on the road.\nThe one reprieve was a return to the\nband, this time at the Marquee.\nBackstage, tensions ran high as the\ncrowds swelled but slowly. The first\nappearance in August had seen queues\ndown the road before the doors opened,\nbut tonight Rosetta were to play against\nthe Cocteau Twins and PWEI. They need\nnot have worried as the turnout was still\nexcellent, despite an extremely dodge y support band, Reptile, thrown on at the\nlast minute by promoters. The larger\nvenue showed both The Ancestry and\nRosetta to their best in a momentous gig,\ndespite the non-appearance of the\nspecially hired lighting.\nThe mood in the dressing-toilet was\ntriumphant, with hoards of Quarriers\nvying for FELIX's cover and impressed\nscouts offering future gigs. But still we\ncould not leave them. The final date on\nthe tour was a few days later at Leeds\nWarehouse. As the last gig and a smaller\nvenue, as well as the presence of almost\nall the Quarriers, this gig became very\ninformal, with heckling at the fore. The\natmosphere became the focal point\n(through the smoke?), rather than\ntechnical precision as both band and\nfollowers revelled in the near party\nmood. It could almost have been in their\nfront room.\nRosetta Stone have the talent and\ndeserve to go much further. Both are\ngenuinely surprised at the amount of\nsuccess they've had. With an album in\nsight, the future is promising. This band\nshould stand out in the ever-increasing\ndilution of this stream of music.\nEpilogue\n'We usually read the stuff afterwards and\nreally regret it and say, ' Oh god, did I really say that?\" So Karl, what are your\nideas on where the band is going? 'We're\ngoing to Liverpool tonight!'\n9\n\n"

    "content": "An Emotional Fish An Emotional Fish are a four piece Irish\nband with a particularly silly (but fairly\nmemorable) name. As any Jasper Carrot\nfan will tell you\u2014fish (or is it just\ngoldfish?) only have a memory capacity\nof a few seconds\u2014so how they can be\n'emotional' is beyond me, but more\nimportantly beyond a fish. They also\nhave a bassist called Edna\u2014who is in fact\nmale! And to top it all I can't work out\nwhat this LP is called\u2014I have a suspicion\nthat it is the original An Emotional Fish\nby An Emotional Fish.\nWell at this point 1 shall admit that I'm not very impressed, and I haven't actually\ngot down to listening to their music ye tso here goes:\nThe LP has ten tracks and sounds at\nAn Emotional Fish LP\ntimes like The Style Council, Prefab\nSprout and U2 among others\u2014quite a selection really.\nThe songs are wordy and intriguing to\nget you reaching for the lyric sheet, but\nonce read they are not profound or\ninteresting enough to stick in your mind.\nThere is, however, an exception\u2014Grey\nMatter which could easily have been\ncalled Ode to Imperial College ('Grey\nmatter fade away...it's a navigation to\nnowhere'). To finish I quite like the\nmelodies, but to be brutal the singer's voice spoils them, and his vocal style gets\nmore irritating every time I listen to the\nLP.\nPinky. mm.\nBlue Pearl Naked LP\nYes, this is the album that brought\npornography to the airwaves, naked\nsteaming bodies on Radio One. Naked In\nThe Rain is the lead track on this medley\nof dance beat and smooch y vocals.\nThe next track continues with more of\nthe first, and could almost e part of the\nextended remix, which is fine if you\nbought the single. In fact, this track was\nprobably the 'clean' version, in case the\nfirst got banned by sq ealing Sharons.\nThe album continues with more beat\nand even manages some rap and a great\nchorus, 'I never knew, That I would fall\nin love with you, I never knew, I don't know what to do, I never knew, I never\nknew, I never knew.' Catchy. 'Chill out.'\nWell, it's mainstream, isn't it.\nThe best? track is a deconstruction of\nKate Bush's Running Up That Hill. No,\nshe definitely can't do those fiddly vocal\nbits.

Cure\nfans stand back and be slaughtered.\nScreams, grunge, howls and noise merge\nand wail into a new heavy shriek. About\nall that remains intact is the bass line in\nan avalanche of confusion and HM distortion.\nAs for the other three tracks, they're\npretty boring as far as psycho-thrash\ngoes.

The\nmost original answers, not necessarily\ncorrect, will win a copy of the album,\nand probably some other vinyl goodies\nwe've got floating around.\nSwervedriver\nFeet First 20.11.90\nAfter an eternity of indie bop and shite,\nthe clock struck twelve and all went quiet\nin anticipation hoping that we would get\nsome decent music at last to justify the\nquid entrance fee.\nThe stage suddenly exploded with\ncolour, the purple being particularly\nimpressive, and on came Swervedriver\nlaunching into their first song. Pretty\nheavy stuff.\nA number of influences came across in\ntheir music, namely Pixies, Mary Chain\nand Dinosaur Jnr. The vocalist struck me\nas sounding like a heavier version of\nElvis Costello which worked really well, it\nwas a pity that the words he sung could\nnot be heard over the growing of the\nguitars and the feedback.\nDespite problems with bad mixing and\nan out of tune bass Swervedriver proved\nexcellent entertainment. So, if you get the\nchance, see them, they're good.\nBrian. Creaming Jesus\nA Forest EP\n\n"
