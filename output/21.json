    "content": "X FELIX\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR HOPPING HAD\nSir - Phe following is a copy of a letter which we\nhave sent to the Hon. Sec. I.C. Entertainments Ctte.\nThe Hon. Sec., I.C. Entertainments Committee.\nDear Sir, We would, like to draw your serious attention to\nthe matter of I.C. hops, as we feel that their pop-u lari ty would justify this further attempt at a solution. It would a'ppear that by the satisfactory exclusion of gate-crashers and any other undesired guests,\nthe present problem could be solved, and we believe\nthat the type of 'atmosphere' desired at our hops\ncould be ensured in the following manner:-Tickets should be on sale in advance only, in the bar and by the Entertainments Secretaries in the\nrelevant women's colleges.\nThese tickets would not be dated - and would\ntherefore by available for any Saturday - but would\nbe date-stamped at the door, thus preventing their further use.\nthis would have the effect of enabling us to\nchoose both our guests and their numbers.\nSuch a system has been in use elsewhere in the\nUniversity and should work to the satisfaction of\nall; the relatively small inconvenience caused\nwould be amply compensated by the results. Yours faithfully, T.J. Gilbert, H. W. Phillips,\nD.Y. Parker, City and Guilds.\nSir This move \"No more hops\" on the part of the Entertainment Committee seems so very childish. It is like saying \"No more beer in the Union\". Saturday night hops are regarded by most members as a very important part of our college social life. Surely the numbers coming to the hops prove how essential these hops are. Regarding overcrowding, there seem two obvious solutions:(1) Have the snack bar hall as an extra dancing room, (2) Issue hop tickets a few days earlier and so limit the numbers. About the\" Palais de Danse atmosphere\" I am sure the point is exaggerated a lot;\" a bit better lighting will surely help to improve the atmosphere.\nYours faithfully, C.A.(C& G.) Sir The decision of Council to stop the Saturday night hops has provided us with a great opportunity to use the Union as a Union, and not as a\" palais\". An energetic and enterprising Entertainments Commi tte e should, and I hope will, be able to organize through the appropriate clubs and societies a large variety of social activities: debates, smoking con-cert s, film shows, glee clubs, country dancing, club da noes, an occasional hop - these are a few suggestions that oom e to mind.Something for everyone should be the object. Perhaps we shall also see a return to the days when the members of the Athletic C^ubs used to come back to the Union to spend the evening over a noggin discussing this, and sometimes that, with great benefit to their team spirit, if little to their health. Whilst agreeing with the substance of Mr. Twist'* letter in your last issue, I cannot help deploring the crudity of his description of the hops as a weekly cattle market. It might have been preferable to\napply Oscar Wilde' s epigram the unspeakable in full pursuit of the un eatable. Yours faithfully, E.M. Hughe\nI.C. Union.\nTO FELIX\nTo speak of thy glory is vain. 'Tis known\nThou'rt covered all over with it. Thy temples of intellect reign; you've shown\nA wonderful, brilliant wit,\nAnd lately you've greatly your brow raised so far. The Culture wave started by brave D. G.R. Has drowned us in Manet and Schubert and Joyce,\nWhile none of your readers dare raise a small voice\nIn favour of Lutcher and Doss. Don't mock\nThe Culture - it's here to stay.\nYou're not now A Minor. Your key.. Unlock\nThe Yale. Let's drink to YOUR DAY!\nWe regret that we have been unable to include\nreports on the Hydro-Power Easter Tour, the\nMountaineering Club Dinner, Rugger Tout and\nthe Whiteley Cup (squash). - Ed.\nINTERNATIONAL GROUP\nSirI would like to bring to your attention the\nrecent formation of a group within the I.C. Political Society, devoted to the study of internat io nal affairs. It is a Batter calling for some comment, that\nin a college the size of ours, there appears to be\ncomplete indifference to the serious problems facing the governments of the world.\nThe responsible position held by the scientist in modern society makes it most important that\nhe should understand the issues at stake. Otherwise his opinions are likely to be influenced by\nalmost any dubious propaganda.\nIt is with the object of fostering a serious\ninterest in, and study of, international, political, social and. economic questions, that the Internati on al Group has been formed. I hope that it will be able to look forward to the keen support of\nI.C.U. members in the future.\nI am, Yours faithfully, K.J. Round (Chairman, International Group)\n2.3-51-IMPERIALISTS\nSir Before the culture bug has completely s wal lowed the college I should like to explain a recent enterprise which has sprung from the ranks of the, so far, uninitiated. It is accepted that at a dance one should criticise the band, and if for this alone the Imperialists have occasionally given hop supporters some-thing to talk about.\nHowever, our ambitions don't rest there and des-pite the naturally critical disposition of one's associates we feel I.C. now has a dance band to which it may turn for light entertainment. I should like to thank all who have shown an interest in the formation of the band and agp peal to any\nhidden talent to come forward and fill the gaps be-Sore next year. Yours etc., J. M.G ll roy,3 rd Civil, C.&G. POTTED POEM\nDear Sir, No pots Have they who write the news,\nBur guides with editorial views:\nPlain glass for FELIX, PHOENIX too.\nWhat willI.e. Union do?\nPot i far( I.C.U. or do I?) THE QUAD.\nSir - The tennis courts surrounded by rusty iron netting constitute a hideous eyesore, inconsistent\nwith the charm and dignity of the college. This\nconglomeration of iron and gravel is scarcely conducive to the atmosphere necessary for the proper\nappreciation of the Arts.\nIs it just that the privileged few should enjoy their tennis to the negation of the best in te rests of the college as a whole? And finally, to\nsee fourteen scantily clad females engaged in the\nvicious sport of netball is the bottom.\nI suggest therefore that the tennis courts are\ntorn up and a Bowling Green (Crown green preferred)\nbe laid in their place. The aesthetic value of\nsuch a green far outweighs the slight inconvenience\ncaused by what are, after all, only minor sectional\ninterests. The colour se heme can be enhanced by\nherba cio us borders or hardy perennials ( i.e. flowers)\nranging from daffodils in the spring to chrysanthemums in the autumn.\nI commend these suggestions for the serious cons ide ration of the authorities concerned.\nYours faithfully, Frank Drake.\nPlymouth, 24th April,'51. \u2022\nADVERTISING RATES: For lC\u00b1 Clubs & Societies,\n1/4 column (4\" deep) 10/- per insertion1/8 column (2\" deep) 5/- \u00ab \u00ab\nAll drawings, made-up advertisements and typing\nshould be black on white paper,and of 5\" maximum\nwidth.

    "content": "FELIX HOCKEY IN HOLLAND At a rather early and unnatural hour on Thursday, March 15th a party of s ii teen representatives\nof I.C.H. C.left for a ten days' tour of Dutch universities. The first weekend was spent in Rotterdam first as the guests of the Hermes Society and then of the\nVictoria Club. The state of the ground before the\n\u2022at ch against Hermes (won 5-0) caused some concern\nbut the carefree abandon with which our opponents\nplayed soon made this a matter of secondary consid-e ration. Justesen was almost caught off guard by\nthe customary cheers taking place before the maat ch, but recovered in time to respond (though no-one\nquite heard who it was we were cheering).\nThe game against the Victoria Club was cancelled due to bad weather. They arranged a trip to\nthe Hockey International, Holland v. Belgium, at\nAmsterdam, and entertained us lavishly at night\nclubs including a chaotic evening in Chinatown.\nOn Monday, March 19th, the party entrained for Utrecht where, in the afternoon, a somewhat bleary-eyed team lost31 against Utrecht students after a hard fight. It was noticeable that one or two\nunnamed players were having more than considerable\ndifficulty in seeing the right ball. However this defeat was later avenged at table-tennis when the\nUtrecht champions were eclipsed at both singles and\ndoubles.\nOn the Wednesday the party left for Groningen\nwhen an overwhelming victory90 was scored over\nthe students. Bennett,previously unheard of as a forward gave a scintillating performance in his new\nrole, scoring seven goals. In the evening we were\nall entertained at an official dinner in the Students' Union. Many speeches were made on both sides,\nsongs were sung und a most convivial evening was\nspent. Finally the paper tablecloths were ceremoniously bur ht much to the chagrin of the waiters.\nLater that night McCall gave a demonstration n of bat-tle drill in the town square, aided and abetted by\nsome Dutch Army veterans.\nAt a mixed hockey tournament in the Hague, a loudspeaker a jp peal brought young, ladies Blocking to\nour banner, and they proved a considerable source of\ninspiration. The impecunious party returned with many happy\nmemories of a most successful tour and look forward\nto entertaining our Dutch friends on a similar scale\nwhen they pay us a return visit in the not too d is tant future. ^_m______________ HEAD OF THE RIVER To quote TUB TIMES,\"An outstanding feature\nof the race was the high performance by Cambridge\nOolleges, who filled eight pf the first twelve\nplaces\". In assessing the performance of the\nI. C.B.C. one must, I feel, bear this in mind, as\nthe 1st, Eight was a considerably better and\nfaster crew than last year. Nevertheless, the\nunpalatable result remains; they finished 29th. and did not row as well as they might have done.\nAs at Heading, a \"rush\" developed, but this time\nthe or ew never settled down into a stride wh i oh ia so essential in a long race of ii miles. Due\nto the rush, they were unable to take full advantage of the tail-wind from Ohiswiok Steps\nto Hammersmith and had little in hand to drive\ntheir boat into the head-wind below Harrods.\nThis probably cost them some ten seconds or so,\nwh i oh would have made a difference of some ten\nor more places. In spite of this performance\nhowever, there are the makings of a good crew in tl\u00bbe present 1st. Eight and with a little rearrange\n-ment they will undoubtedly give a very good\na ooo unt of themselves in the regattas this term.\nThe greatest distinction o on fer red on the\nClub occurred after the race, when the Oaptain,\n\"Micky\" North, and the oo a oh, Charles Bristow\nhad the honour of being presented to H.H. H. the\nPrincess Elizabeth at the Thames Rowing Club.\nFinal pl aol ng s)1.0.1,29,I.O. ll l37,I.O. IIIi 67, I.O. IVs 122,\nI.C Vi173,I. C VIl136,I. O. VIIt 185, I.C VIII:205, I. CIXi209. TECHNOLOGY CUP R.O.S. won the Technology uup for the\nsecond year in succession when they defeated R.S. M. by two goals to nil in the final which was played\nat a arlington on Wednesday March 14th before a crowd of some five persons.\nIn the first half R.O.S. nearly scored\ntwice, once when a Miner who shall be nameless\nheaded the ball against a post, and later when the\nMines 'keeper completely misjudged a speculative\npunt by Taylor from the half-way line. After the interval the Miners kept R.u.S. at bay until, In the 14th minute, just when the\nR.u.S. defence was finding life very difficult, there was a mix-up in the Mines defence and the\nball wriggled its way into the net from Watson.\nUollinson tried desperately to rally his men but\nin the 35th minute Browne, who had a good match,\ncentred and a Mines defender handled. Buckroyd\nshot the resulting penalty straight at the goalkeeper who found it too hot to hold and Jaokman\nfollowing up, scored. Thus ended the match and\nall that remained was for Dr. Stevens to present\nthe o up to David Thompson.\nATHLETICS The first match of the season, against Walton\nA.C., was held on Tuesday 17th April. At the\nmeeting Mr. Roger Bannister (0.U. A.C.) broke the\nBritish Native record for the J mile in a time of\n2 m ln.56.8 sec. and was very close to the fastest\ntime ever recorded for this distance. On the t raft kI. C. faced stiff opposition and failed to get the\nbetter of their opponents, but in the field events\nthey fared better, Brookman winning the Shot, Discus\nand Javelin, and Bean came second in the Shot,and\nDiscus. These successes were however insufficient to save the day and I.C. lost by a narrow margin.\nIt was a Jleasing sight to see some Ii C supporters\nat the match, and we hope that this will continue,\neven when record-breaking by Bannister is not an\nadditional attraction.\nRUG G ERR.S. M.6 Camborne S.M.3 On Friday March 16th the annual match between the Mines and Camborne S.M. was played at\nHarlington. Mines won the toss and k ioke doff against the wind. In the first half the play\nwas fairly even and when half-time came the score\nstood at 3-3, Mines gavin g scored a penalty goal\nk ioke d by Bill Bobinson and Camborne a try. The second half was marked by hard fought\nline-outs, close marking, and a wonderful try by Barry. Intercepting a pass he went inside\none opponent and outside his opposite number,\nfollowing this up by a run of 70 yards, he went\nover in the corner. For the rest of the game\nCamborne pressed hard but the result it e Miners\nkept them u out and thus regained the 'bottle'.\nCRICKET i.e. u.c. When I.C. began batting on Saturday, under\ngloomy skies in a north wind, Harlington resembled\nmore a tundra than a cricket ground; and the first desultory hour (40 runs for3 wickets) seemed to\nconfirm that it was too cold for bowlers and too\nearly in the season for batsmen.\nThen Dave Waterland, after some preliminary\nsparring about, settled down to deliver himself of\na lively51. Other useful contributors, including\n29 by Geoff Bennett, helped the score to 140 for6 dec. which is a respectable total for two hours'\nbatting on such a day.\nU.C. got to 103-5 (Kemp 63 not out} before\nstumps were drawn and never appeared in serious\ndanger of defeat. I.C.'s bowling and fielding were considerably less impressive than the batting,\nbut will no doubt improve when the sun shines again.\nMeantime the season has opened without fain, snow\nor disaster, which has not always been so in the\npast.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 5\nVIEWPOINT\nSATURDAY NIGHT HOPS\nIt seems that the fate of our Saturday Night\nHops hangs very precariously in the balance. To me,\nat, any rate, this is indeed a sad state of affairs and one * h ichI feel sure is going to cause some\nheated discussion in the very near future. It will not be inappropriate, therefore, to give a brief history of the Hops for the benefit of newcomers to\nI.C. There are still a few amongst us who remember\nhow it all began. Informal Dances, to give them\ntheir proper name, were introduced in the Autumn of\n1946 and fer e intended mainly for Hostel residents, whose lack of energy ( or was it cash?) debarred them\nfrom the many Saturday Night attractions away from\nthe Union. The first problem which faced the organ-is ers was the provision of partners, the Hostel and\nindeed the Union,being quite incapable of self support. There being no Q.A. at that time, a remedy\nwas sought by issuing standing invitations to women\nstudents of other Colleges. The early Hops had to\npay for themselves and gramophone records were\nurgently' needed, so the call went out to the rest of\nthe Union to support this new I.C. venture. In those days, the I.u. U. Entertainments Gommitteejas we know it now,did not exist. The\norganisers relied on the help of any members of the\nUnion who could be cajoled or bribed into giving a hand and they themselves put in many hours of hard\nwork, moving furniture, sweeping floors, etc. Gradually the hard work and enthusiasm of these\npioneers began to bring its reward - the Hops were\nestablished, touring the next two or three years, a great effort was made to improve the Hops, to provide the best bob's worth possible. As the takings grew\nthe stock of gramophone records was increased and\n\" sifted\" until our collection became the envy of\nmany. Much was done to make the task of the organ-is ers easier. By this time the I.C.U. Entertainments Committee had come into being with a constitution and\nstatus worthy of the tasks which it was called upon\nto perform. What of the present position? Up to this year it has been our proud boast that the Hops never stop\n- they continue right to the end of the Session. But this year, the Entertainments Committee had the\naudacity to suggest that no Hops be held in the Summer\nTerm! Why does the Entertainments Committee wish to\ndiscontinue the Hops? Perhaps they have had enough\nby now. After almost three years of organising Hops\nI can sym pathis e with them - but we never let the\nUnion down before. On the other hand, there have been complaints about the Hops and several have found their way into Felix. Again, this is not unusual. There have been\ncriticisms of the Hops ever since they started. It is the old, old story people are always ready to\ncomplain or criticise, but very few find time to write letters of praise or offering useful suggestions. Hc-ever, in spite of the critics, I still maintain as\nI have done for several years that while400 people\ncontinue to attend the Hops each Saturday, they must\nbe popular. In fairness to the critics, I must admit that members of the Union do little to encourage or help the hardworking Entertainments Committee. There are\nfar too many who are ready to introduce a\" personal guest\". If a ticket system was introduced, there would still be the smart boys who would walk straight in without a ticket. A little more effort on our\npart would do far more to improve the conditions at\nthe Hops than any action by Council. Summing up, I would say that the Entertainments Committee were not justified in asking that the Hops\nbe discontinued. Nor in my opinion was Council wise\nto implement that decision. This is a matter which\nis of great interest to a large section of the Union\nand I feel that only a resolution passed by a Union\nmeet in f should be able to bring to an end a function which is now accepted as a regular feature of our\nCollege life.R, am.\n( Successively Hon.

The honest fellow is more likely to read into these lines a youth, now long\npast, of un remitted dissipation, and a few minutes'\ndiscourse with Pete himself will un shake ably confirm\nhim in this view. Tes, let's not hedge - the President of R.C.S. is rather a rogue.\nHaskell is well down the slope to the sere and\nyellow. Finishing his fourth year in the Arts ( i.e. biological) Faculty of I.C., where his particular lack of discipline is Entomology, he must be one of\nthe few undergraduate relics of that wartime genera-tion who came up in the prime of their middle twenties.\nHe hadn't then become so completely an ev angel for Culture, and was wont to unload his su jj V us ergs via an\noar in the I.C.3 rd eight. The decrepitude of passing years and the time-consuming demands of hot-gospel-ling for the Liberal Ideal have of late confined Pete'*\nrowing to the towpath or even further inland. The\nfact that the boat club demands a subscription perhaps\nhastened the at hle tle decline.\nPete's late arrival on the I.C. campus was consequent upon his being requested to serve his Majesty's pleasure. Avoiding the army, he helped postpone the\nday of victory some years by serving in the Royal Shower (of Signals). In this connection, as his main\nclaim to fame, Pete insists that he was the only blok e to serve in the Western Desert who didn't receive a packet of cigarettes from Gen. Montgomery. A most\nilluminating comment on this phase of Haskography is his remark, a prop as army tea,\" It would take more than\nbromide to subdue me, I can telly eu'.'. Haskell first achieved eminence at I.C. as president of the Natural History Society. During his reign the society expanded its interests to embrace\npsychic as well as the more 'natural' topics. In\ncontradiction to the other learned societies, the tendency in the N.H.S. has been to pursue extra mural nat-ural history in a cloak of lighthearted frivolity. Haskell, already thus be cloaked in his intramural act-iv it ie s,oo ul d not help at times inciting the club to\nlighthearted frenzies but tenuously related to nature\nstudy.\nIn the summer of 1950 Haskell was nominated for the Presidency of R.C.S. His agents, with the aid of\ndevious corrupt practices - which cost a small fortune\nin beer money - managed to secure his election. At\nthe estimate of his work for the Union the harshest\nde nigra tors would admit that Pete has considerably\nstirred the placid flow of routine college life. He\nhas consistently and continually brought before our\nnotice the existence of other possible ranges of act-iv it y ber. les beer and sport( not that he disparages\nthese essentials - in his cups Haskell has of t and\naye proclaimed \"Vive le Sport I\") Whether of not the\ncollege is really interested in these \"other ranges\"\nis a matter hotly disputed in these columns. In the\nmeantime Haskell continues in his efforts to achieve\nsome integration between the \"mechanics\" of I.C. and\nour long-haired brethren over the road.\nEvidently Pete is interested in the humanities.\nWho else shows such erudition in Rabelais, Boccaccio\nand the lewder Latins?

C. members who managed t of on go the pleasures of study to spend a few days among the\nmountains of Glencoe, found the conditions almost Alpine. The weather was on the whole quite good.\nThere were days,when a visit to the Kings house Inn was an expedition, but more days when the sky was\nblue and the full beauty of the snow peaks was revealed. The catering throughout the meet was up to the usual I. C.M. C. standard and the strongest ap petit ies in the party were satisfied. Many fine expeditions involving, in the main,\nsnow climbing were made. The traverse of the ADnach Eagach ridge was perhaps the most enjoyable. At first the mist obscured the infinite spaces which were reputed to exist on either side of the rUd\u00a7e, but as we climbed the final snow ridge, the mist cleared revealing far below the waters of Loch Leven.\nThe ascents on Bu a chail leEt ive Mor and Bide an Nam\nBian were equally enjoyable. At times the efforts required to reach the top seemed considerable, but the summit views of hill, moor and loch were ample\nreward. In terms of the pleasure derived by those taking part, this..was a most successful meet.\nTRAVELLERS'\n- CUTTING\nJOYCOSTS\nREDUCES FARES which bring that Continental Holiday well within your reach boat to Denmark (\u00a38) and Sweden (\u00a314), and rail travel to many Continental destinations.

If his recent application of\nthis quality to the more sombre subject of Zoo Finals has=.been smiled upon by the presiding deity of the\nexamination halls, Haskell next year hopes to continue\nat I.C. as research student.

Alas for the gentle art of biology, science is ft j st encroaching on its domain. And Pete now intends\nto get in with Science.\nFinally a few measurements. External length of\nleg, 34\"; internal length of leg32\". This disparity gives rise to the characteristic outward convexity at\nthe knees which has led many to regard Haskell, mis-taken ly, as a cavalry w allah.

Referring to Reciprocal Union\nMembership Mr. Haskell told the council that the RCA. had offered I.C. members the use of their Union premises including refectory facilities. After along discussion Mr.' Halsey proposed\nthat the R.C.A. be thanked for their offer and that in return R.C.A. and R.C.M. students be granted the\nuse of I.C. lounge facilities after5 p.m. Seconded\nby Mr. de Reuck the motion i was carried97 with3 abstentions.1> \u2022\nThe President pointed out that use of re fec tory and bar facilities by R.C.M. and R.C.A. students was the province of the refectory committee.\nIt was decided to make no recommendation to them\nuntil the results of the present motion had been\nobserved. NO HOPS THIS TERM\nLater in the meeting the Council adopted unani mou sly a' resolution put forward by the ent crt a in msn ts committee that the Saturday Evening Hops be\ndiscontinued as from the end of the Lent Term,1951The reasons r:iven in support of this motion were that complaints had been received regarding the tone of the Hops, that the Hops were giving the\nCollege a bad name, that individual club dances were\nsuffering from poor attendance, which might be caused by having HODS every Saturday night, and that the gym. floor was wearing rapidly. It is understood that an I.C. General Meet _.ag\nwill be held on May 10th to discuss both these dec is ions. UNION MEMBERSHIP FEES\nThe Council made the following recommendation\nto the Governors for changes in Life Membership fees:(1) That a student should not be eligible unless he had completed 1 year's full session in I.C.(2) That the fees should be:-a)2 guineas if3 or more sessions completed\nb)3 guineas if1 or 2 sessions completed\no)3 guineas for the staff. T.B. APPEAL\nIt has \"been decided, to hold the collection for the T.B. Appeal Fund (mentioned in an earlier edition of FELIX) on\nThursday May. 10th0 It is hoped tc carry the collection tc all departments of\nthe College, including members of staff0 For this purpose we\nshall require the assistance of about 20 students in each of\nR.C.S. and C&a. and 10 students in R.S. M. Flease show your generosity when the collection is taken\nand give at least 2/6d so that we may break the target of\n.\u00a3200 and, if possible, collect considerably more than this\namount, ^at ch the notice-boards for further information.\nAnyone wishing to assist with the collection please let me know,\nDerek Y. Coomber, President I.C. II.\nMINES CARNIVAL\nFELIX thought it advisable to employ two observers to report the Mines Carnival: for it was fore seen that one was most unlikely to last the evening\nunaided. From time to time, therefore, these observers felt obliged to leave their own party and\nto wander upstairs, where they found themselves\nuh paid extras in what might well have been a scene\nfrom Treasure Island. *\n>\n\u2022\nBuccaneer^' Barbecue was undoubtedly the most\nresplendently decorated carnival of recent years,\nand bore every indication of the recent campaign\nwaged by the phantasm o gen it or of each college in turn to ou do each other's work. We feel that this tendency must inevitably soon cease, before the\nUnion building itself is destroyed for the sake' of\nthe Carnival. (Continued on p.3) TWO MOKE U.L. CUPS SAILING\nResult:1s tI. e.,2nd Chelsea Poly.,3 r dU.C The Foundation Cup is awarded to the college with the highest number of points obtained in the\nInterCollegiate races, which are held during the Winter and Lent terms. I.C. started the season\nwell, winning several of the first races, but this lead gradually diminished until just before the fi nal trace I.e. was first equal with U.C. and Chelsea Poly.3 rd with two points less. Thus to v/ in the\ncup I.C. had to beat U.C., but could afford to come\nin one position behind Chelsea Poly. Seven Firefly dinghies representing I.C.,U. C., Chelsea Poly., N.E.C. and C.E.M. started the race\nin a strong squall y wind over two laps of a triangular course. At the start U.C. took the lead, Chelsea were\nin second place with I.C.3 rd end 4th. Passing the first buoy, which involved a gybe, a squall hit the fleet and U.C.' s boat capsized giving Chelsea\nthe lead which they maintained. I.C. now held the\n2nd and \u00ab3rd placed, and. stayed there till the finish, only three boats surviving the course. Thus owing to U.C.' s sudden departure from the\nrace and Chelsea' s gaining an advantage of only one\npoint, I.C won the cup by the narrow margin of one\npoint. BOXING\nOn March 16th I.C. once again proved their boxing superiority when they won the U.L. Cup by a very\ncomfortable margin:,\nI.C29 points\nGoldsmiths' 16 points\nKing's13 points\nGordon Tait and Johnny Martin both* obtained walk-overs in the finals of the Flyweight and Bantamweight\ndivisions respectively. We must thank them for being\npresent at the weigh-in and our Publicity Agent & r frightening away all likely opposition in these weights.\nThe referee prevented Mike Humphries from dealing\nout any more punishment toM. Sargent (Goldsmiths')\nwhen he stopped the Featherweight final in the second round. In the well-matched Lightweight final Bill Gardner used his left hand to gro d effect to keep J. Reavey (King's) at long range, but last narrowly on\npoints.\nWe saw the most interesting fight of the evening\nwhen Stan Coppelman went out to meet A. Dujon (King's) in the Welterweight final. Stan made many valiant\nattempts to get at close quarters wirth his very experienced opponent but Dujon had most of the answers to\nStan's s to ming attacks and gained a points decision.\nIt was a great tonic for I.C. spectators to see\nthe most businesslike way in which Hugh Huckin set\nabout D. Jessett (King's) in the Middleweight final to put him on the canvas for counts of seven, eight\nand finally ten. The most unfortunate incident in a wonderful evening for I.C. was in the Light Heavyweight final when PierseEbswoi+h sustained a rather\nnasty cut over his eye from the inside of his opp-on ent's glove. Piers was well ahead of G. Wootton\n(Goldsmiths') on points when the referee stopped the\nfight in the second round.\nAfter the boxing Terry ( \" Killer\") Hulme, the I.C. Captain was presented with the \" B lott\" Cup and Gordon\nSalt, Johnny Martin, Mike Humphries and Hugh Huckin\neach received aU.L.A. U. medal.\nLater in the evening a number of inebriated boxers were to be seen enjoying themselves at the Mines\nCarnival much to the BPnoyance of certain gentlemen\nwho frequently lost their partners for short periods\nof time.\nWe should like to congratulate Mike Humphries\nand Gordon Tait on having been chosen to box for U.L. against Paris University on May 15th.

Council meeting two very\ncontroversial issues were brought up for discussion and important decisions of far-reaching con\u2022eq ueno e were taken, without an attempt Wing made\nft rf lt to sound the opinion of members of the Union.\nWhile it is true that Council is responsible for\nthe day to day running of t he Union, it is with\nKrave o ono ern that one views their recent action\naffecting as it does the fundamental privileges\nof every member of the Union.\nIt o an be, and has been argued that the two\nis sues differ widely in principle and that whereas\nthe question of the continuance or otherwise of\nthe Hops is one on which Council should take the\nlead, that concerning the extension of certain\nUnion facilities to members of other oo lle ges is a matter on which the Union members should be con-sul ted. While there is something tote said for\nthis view,one must be careful to ascertain that\nthese supporting it do not do so because they are\nin favour of one decision and against the other l It has been wisely decided to put an end to\nthe countless private arg mm ents and have both these\ntopics di sousse d freely at a Union meeting. Let\nthe quiet drinkers, noisy dancers, intercollegiate s and isolationists come forward and air their op in ions.\nTICKET OR LEAVE IT\nSo far in the minutes of the Refectory Committee we have failed to find any proposal to restore\nthe social intercourse that was a part of the old\ntio ket system - the game of hunt-the-supper-ticket,\nas played from 6.20 to 6.50 ewer y evening (except\nSundays).\nHow many of our closest acquaintances were not,\nin fact, introduced first for such enquiries, and\nhow often have we not stood at the door with this\nexcuse for conversation on our lips and with one of\nthe 376 (?) possible permutations of 2/3d getting\nhot in our hands, searching for a lady of I. C.W. A., unaccompanied and as yet un met? Teetotallers, Presidents, fresher s and brown-bag gers were thus mixed and fed into the soo i al stew.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO FELIX\nContributions to FELIX should always be in as\nearly as possible, and except for typed material, must be received by midday of the Friday before publication. Typing should be single spaced,5\" wide, and can be received up to Sunday midday.\nReaders' letters are always welcome, but please be brief and to the point. All material, except\nthat for the Sports Editor or 'Coming Events' shou ld be addressed to the Editor, I.C. Union.( Continued from p.l.) So impressive was the decor, that the quality of the cabaret was not noticed in fact, we cannot\nclearly remember even now quite what it was like. We can call to mind visions' of a dusky maiden attempting to keep order amongst a nigger minstrel quartet, the hilariously irrelevant entry of a cow, an\nIndian rope trick, a remarkable display of strength and yet another calypso, all presented in a the atri Bal plethora. As the evening wore on, and the group photo graph had been successfully taken despite the gesticulations of a few people who prefer to appear only\nas a meaningless blur, the pace of the proceedings slackened but little. The R.C.M. band did marathon\nwork in this direction, keeping their tempo fresh to the last i The masts began to used as leaning posts, the bulwarks as backrests, and the pigging... We returned from this per n octal fantasia to our own , quieter party. We remembered the Mines\nCarnival for its magnificence. Some say there was\nreindeer meat too J M.D. H.B. J.S. FESTIVAL OF I am one of the boys from the BankNot Barclay's or National P. But that nice situation by Waterloo Station On the left coming up from these a. I am one of the few who've been chosen to do\nDesigns for the Great Exhibition, And as they may appear just a little bit queer\nI have come along here with a flea in my ear To try to explain the position. Each material used must be of a type\nThat has never before been employed,\nEach architect chosen from a list of dozen\nOr the Mars group get frightfully annoyed.\nEach building designed must be of a type Which has never before been erected, It must have no visible means of support Or the whole bloody thing is rejected. ASCENT OF F6\nThe Dramatic Society were paid the compliment of a critique of their Easter production\nin the Times Educational Supplement (April 6th). Whilst not agreeing with the Times writer that\nthe choice of Auden & Isherwood's satirical drama\nof the' thirties was \"wise\", one must admit that\nit came off better than expected; the machinations of the politicians and patriots of that\nperiod were effectively exposed and their motives interpreted. Though, the final moral near\nthe end of the play was obscured from the present\nwriter - in fact, had the conqueror of F.6. \"succ-ee ded\" or \"failed\"?\nThe lead, that of Michael Ransom, played by\nChristopher McKoen, was a remarkable feat of memory and endurance. Ransom emerged as a solid and credible character - if, perhaps, Just al it tle too extrovert.\nOf the other parts, Gillian Stern was magni-fi cent as Lady Isobel Welwyn; the Times writer\nsays: \"A memorably preposterous Lady Isobel\".\nDagid Greenfield presented a convincing wastrel\nas David Gunn and Jean Osborne was praiseworthy\nas the Mother. John Harding and Brynnie Griffin gave a nicely restrained performance as Mr. and\nMrs. A. The. Times Educational Supplement's final words must have been gratifying to the players\nand the producer (Shirley Meet): \"But each character was firmly seized and given that intellectual life w hio hit is the student actor's special power\nto conjure up\"!\n\n"
