Although I am\nin a reflective mood this\nevening, I'm not yet at\nthe 'assessing my tenure'\nlevel of self-reflection\nyet (give it a couple\nweeks!) Instead, I remembered a promise I\nmade at the start of the\nyear. I promised that\none day this Editorial\nwould almost entirely\nconsist of pull-quotes,\nand there's nothing you\ncan do about it. Today\nis that day. Desperate\ntimes call for desperate\nmeasures of course.\nBefore I do that, I will\njot down the little I do\nhave to say. This week's\nissue of Felix features the\ndelayed follow-up to my\npredecessor Fred's piece\non the Student Counselling & Mental Health\nAdvice service. I'm\ncurrently still compiling\nover 30 pages of notes,\nresearch and transcribed\ndiscussions with involved\nstaff and students into one\ncoherent two (and a bit)\npage article so we'll see\nhow it turns out. To briefly\nsummarise the article,\nalthough the service has\nbeen allocated additional\nfunding, it is now faced\n2\nwith an issue of spacing\nand, as a result, has been\nunable to increase the\nresources available to students in the last academic\nyear. This is a disappointing state of affairs but the\nissue could soon be somewhat resolved and there\nis hope to be found in the\nrecent developments.\nThe Augur Review of\ntuition fees was released\nearlier today and will have\nthe full Felix coverage in\nnext week's issue of the\npaper, so be sure to look\nout for that!\nPHOENIX,\nImperial\u2019s magazine, formerly known as\nIf you are interested in Grime\n& Black British music, we want\nto hear from you!\nWhat does Grime mean to\nyou?\nIf you\u2019re interested, please email Felix@imperial.ac.uk\nreturns...with a twist!\n3\nISSUE 1723\nNEWS\nFELIX\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe grass on Queen's\nLawn has seen better days\n// Imperial College Library\nPatchy Queen's Lawn causes complaints\nNEWS\nJason Murugesu\nNews Writer\nT\nhe grass on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn\nhas been suffering greatly due\nto an excess of events\nbeing held on the space,\nresulting in student\ncomplaints.

Perhaps\nyou\u2019re a swordfighter,\nlooking for a change up in\nweaponry, maybe something with a bit more brute\nforce, maybe a mallet? Do\nyou wish to infuriate your\nopponent by living to the\nmost obscene of percent-ages, coming back each\ntime to serve a mightier\nclobbering than the last?\nMost importantly, do\nyou want to summon the\nimage of ultimate perfec-tion, simply by holding\ndown on the left-stick? If\nyou answered yes to any\nof the above, the King of\nDreamland has it all.\nOn the ground, Dedede\nhas numerous options\nto pile on pressure and\nkeep his rivals out. Most\nnotably, his forward tilt\nmakes him reach out with\na spinning mallet, and it\noutranges most characters\u2019\nswords or close quarters\ncombat options. His up\ntilt is good for covering\nthe air, keeping airborne\nfighters in check and\ncreating aerial follow-ups,\nand his down tilt makes\nhim roll into his oppo-nents, setting up consistent tech situations and jab\nlock combos. To finish up\nhis grounded arsenal, dash\nattacking will send this\nflightless fellow into an\nall-in dive across the stage\n- a high-risk high-reward\noption which can also kill\nat higher percentages. The\nhitbox also lingers for a\nwhile, enabling two-frame\npunishes at the ledge.\nWhile he may be a\npenguin, Dedede\u2019s aerial\ngame is nothing to sneeze\nat either. On top of strong\naerial attacks, he has a\ntotal of four jumps, giving\nhim strong recovery\nand makes him a huge\nthreat (figuratively and\nliterally) vertically. His\njumping jack-like neutral\nair comes out extremely\nfast, trading favourably\nwith aerial opposition in\nalmost all instances, and\nfast falling out of n-air\n(normal air) also allows\nyou to combo into grabs,\njabs, tilts, or even another\nn-air, making it a decent\napproach option. Looking\nat his other aerials, his\nback air swing is his go-to\naerial option when going\nfor a knockout thanks to\nits high knockback. His\nn-air, fair and up air are\nall good followups to his\ndown throw, allowing you\nto tack on damage early in\nthe game.\nThe real flair in\nDedede\u2019s gameplay\ncomes from his Specials.\nHis neutral Special, the\nInhale, sucks anything\nfrom projectiles to\nwhole opponents into his\nstomach, doubling as both\na command grab and a\nprojectile reflector. This\nmove is also the source\nfor some of the funniest\nand most undeserved\nstocks you can achieve\nin the game. In a rough\nspot off-stage and your\nopponent is too close to\nthe ledge? Simply hold\ndown that B button as\nyou descend, suck your\nopponent in, and spit them\nunder the stage leaving\nthem sweating to make it\nback to stage, or simply\ndrop gracefully into the\nvoid of the bottom Smash\nBox and take them with\nyou.\nThis goes hand in hand\nwith his own projectile,\nthe Gordo - a sentient\nspiky bouncy ball that can\n\u201cI do not like this painting Charlie, it\u2019s smug aura mocks me\u201d // Nintendo + IASIP\n\u201cHe shines\nmost in\ndealing with\nhis victims\noff stage -possessing\nsome of the\nbest edge\nguarding\u201d\nbe thrown with his side\nspecial, and can cause a\nlot of damage, and even\nhas the chance of sticking\nto the ledges to give recovering fighters hell. Combo\nthis with the Inhale to\nsend the Gordo at your\nopponents with even more\nspeed and stopping power.\nHis Up Special, the\nSuper Jump, sends him\nflying upwards, and\neventually crashing\ndownwards to devastating\neffect when landed on\nan opponent on stage.\nThis does have immense\nend-lag and is by far the\nmost punishable move in\nhis arsenal however, so\nit is best used to simply\nmake it back to the ledge.\nThe insane vertical gain\non this move, along with\nmultiple jumps, serves as\nthe basis for his recovery\nand allows him to make\nit back from seemingly\nanywhere. Lastly, his\ndown Special, the Jet\nHammer, is a chargeable\nmechanised swing of his\nalready hefty hammer,\nwhich has super armour\nand the ability to break\nshields when charged\nup. This can be used in\ncombination with Gordos\nat the ledge to force your\nopponent into unfavourable get-up situations that\ncan give you the lead.\nIn terms of overall\ngameplan, Dedede is a defensive heavy, best played\nby keeping approaching\nopposition out with his\ndisjointed tilts and strong\naerials, while also creating\nopenings and conditioning the opponent with his\nprojectile and multiple\njumps.\nHe shines most in\ndealing with his victims\noffstage-possessingsome\nof the best edge guarding\nand ledge trapping tools\nin the game, he\u2019s able to\nmaintain this advantage\nstate to ensure a stock.\nUnlike his other heavy\npeers, Dedede excels in\nthe air thanks to his four\njumps and high-reaching\nUp Special. This allows\nhim to chase deep off-stage, while being able to\nmake it back from what\nwould be unreachable for\nmost of the cast without a\nscratch.\nHe is an exceptionally\nsolid mid-tier pick. Regardless of his strengths, it\ndoesn\u2019t save him from his\nlack of approach options,\nmaking patient play and\nzoning against him very\neffective and difficult to\nbreak. His rotund body\nhabitus also makes him\npretty difficult to miss,\nfurther making him susceptible to lengthy combo\nstrings when in disadvan-tage, allowing rush-down\ncharacters to quickly rack\nup free damage on him.\nAll is not woes for this\nmerry monarch though\n- even with his glaring\nweaknesses, playing with\npatience, foresight and\nactive planning will gain\nyou the most mileage with\nthis character. Use his\nheavy status and amazing\nrecovery to live to really\nhigh percents, and this\nwill give you more interactions to partake in and\nstudy, buying you the time\nto download and adapt to\nthe other player\u2019s habits,\nand capitalize in ways\nnobody else in the cast\ncan.\nDespite his flaws,\nyou can\u2019t really knock\nself-proclaimed perfec-tion. If you are interested\nin learning more about\nthis engorged, flightless\nbird, YouTubers such as\nD3nsity produce dedicated content, with detailed\nmatchup guides and tech\ntutorials. The Dedediscord\non Smashcords also has\na plethora of guides and\nresources, including a 9\npage document dedicated\nto Gordo tech alone. So\nwhat are you waiting for?\nPick up the mallet and\nfind the true King within\nyourselves!\n\n"

Having\nlaid the correct framework\nfor your ideas and performed your background\nresearch, we now discuss\nhow you realise your\nideas in practical terms....\nFunding\nHaving validated\nyour idea, your primary\nconcerns will be\neconomic. Where do you\nget the funds to realise\nyour app? If you are in a\nposition to self fund, fan-tastic! Greater risk equals\ngreater reward. If you\nare not, you have several\noptions. These include\nobtaining grants, angel\nfunding, venture capital\nand even crowdsourcing.\nThere is a wealth of information online regarding\neach of these avenues. It\nis important to remember\nthat you will be giving up\nequity in your business to\nobtain these funds (suc-cessfully obtaining a grant\nbeing the exception).\nMost app start-ups go\nthrough multiple rounds\nof fundraising to cater to\ntheir different stages of\ngrowth. As you become\nmore successful, the\namount of equity you give\nup reduces as the risk to\n\u201cThere are\nprogrammes\nin place that\ncater to start-ups at different\nstages of their\ngrowth.\u201d\ninvestors is minimised.\nMany universities and\nfinancial institutions offer\nincubators where accepted\nstart-ups are mentored\nthrough the entire process\nand introduced to potential funders. These are\npowerful tools for a young\nstart-up but do remember\nthat you will probably be\ngiving up equity and potentially IP rights too. In\nfact there are programmes\nin place that cater to start-ups at different stages of\ntheir growth, scalability\nawards being a prime\nexample.\nGetting it built\nFirst question, do you\nhave someone capable of\nbuilding your platform?\nIf you or a partner are a\ncomputing whizz and are\nable, wonderful! Failing\nthat, there are several\nthings to consider (and\nthese typically revolve\naround simple eco-nomics). If you\u2019re well\nfunded, you can approach\na local company to build\nyour platform for you. If\nyou aren\u2019t, you can source\na partner capable of doing\nso. This will again involve\ngiving up equity in your\ncompany. Another option\nis to outsource. There\nare many websites which\nallow you to put your\nideas out to tender. Developers will then compete\nfor your job. Having a non\ndisclosure agreement here\nis valuable. You can find\nsimple templates for these\nonline although most\nfreelance developers will\nalready have their own.\nThere are always success\nand sob stories when\ndealing with developers,\nregardless the route taken.\nDealing with developers overseas is notoriously challenging. Being\nable to relay technical\ninformation to someone\nwho speaks English as\na second (third, or even\nfourth) language is not\neasy. Culture can also\ndictate branding and the\nway your platform may\nlook. Hence, a hybrid\napproach might be the\nmost sensible option.\nMany UK based development houses will offer a\ncut price prototype service\nwhere they provide high\nres mock ups of how your\nplatform should look and\nfunction. They may also\nhave input to colourways\nand branding. All this IP\nbelongs to you and you\ncan then hand this over\nto someone overseas who\ncan code at a fraction of\nthe cost.\nNo matter the route you\ndecide, it\u2019s important to\nframe the project correctly\nand to ensure that payment\nis made based upon completion of milestones or\ndeliverables. This will be\nworded into your contract.\nIt is important to ensure\nthat you own the rights to\neverything, especially in\nthe unfortunate instance\nof this relationship turning\nsour. You must also\nensure that your platform\nis not shared with anyone\nelse without your express\npermission.\nMarketing\nYou obviously want\nyour core audience to\ndownload and use your\napp. In most cases the\nkey to success is market-ing. Not just in terms of\nhaving a healthy marketing budget but having a\ntargeted marketing plan.\nUtilising social media\nis immensely powerful.\nYou can advertise on\nFacebook and Instagram.\nThis is more sophisticated\nthan most would think\nand allows you to reach\nspecific audience demographics and locations.\nThe price for this service is\nalso not prohibitive. Local\nadvertising campaigns\n(think leaflets, posters and\nplacards) and trade shows\nare also helpful.\nAs you grow, you\nmay want to seek the\nassistance of a marketing\nspecialist who will help\nyou get your message to\nyour target audience.\nNext week we will\nbe detailing our app\n\u2018Impromptu\u2019 and its back\nstory....\nISSUE 1723\nFELIX\n9\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nImpromptu is launching to Imperial students in two months\u2019time // Impromptu\n\u201cMany\nUK based\ndevelopment\nhouses\nwill offer\na cut price\nprototype\nservice\u201d\n\n"

The friction and\ntension surrounding the\nUS-China trade war uncertainty has dampened\nthe forecasted earnings\nof technology companies\nsuch as Apple who recently revised their first\nquarter earnings forecast.\nThis redection in profitability has had its roots in\nthe trade disruption which\nhas had a direct impact on\nthe operating costs of the\ncompany. The increased\ntrade risks and risk premiums are reflected in the\nequity prices of technology stocks.\nNevertheless, the two\nmain economic indicators\nof recessions \u2013 rising\nunemployment and yield\ncurve inversion - are still\nvaluation in a Next Twelve\nMonth (NTM) outlook.\nThis stock pitch held true\nin the Oct 18 stock sell-off, during which there\nwas an equity self-off of\ntechnology stocks, with\nthe tech heavy NASDAQ\nbenchmark having its\nworst quarterly loss since\nthe 08-09 Global financial\nCrisis.\nI would like to talk\nfurther about the highly\nvolatile Technology\nsector. Let us use the\nTech-heavy NASDAQ\nindex as a benchmark to\nmeasure the aggregated\nperformance for the Tech\nsector.\nObserving the\nNASDAQ index, you will\nsee three major equity\nsell-off periods \u2013 Feb,\nOctober and December.\nComparing this with\nthe VIX index, you will\nobserve that the same\n3 periods stood out as\nperiods of high volatility\nand high market fear.\nOverall, the\nperformance of the\nTech sector suffered,\nparticularly due to the\nexisting trade war between\nthe U.S. and China, where\ntariffs have been enforced\non tech goods.\nThe February sell-off\noriginated from increasing\nwage pressures (inflation),\nwhere investors expected\nthe Fed to raise interest\nrates. The fact that the\nseemingly positive news\nof rising wages would\nbe treated as bad news,\nis a sign of a late-stage\nbull market. Investors\nbegan suspecting that\nthe financial conditions\nwould tighten and this led\nto a harsh equity sell-off,\nparticularly for tech stocks\ndue to the commonly held\nview that tech stocks are\novervalued.\nThe October Techstock stemmed from the\nFed increasing its funds\nrate (conversely interest\nrates). Coupled with\nlowered earnings due to\nthe trade war between\nU.S. and China, where\noperating profits of tech\ncompanies took a hit.\nSimilarly, the Dec sell-off\nstemmed from the rise in\nFed fund target rates. This\nsell-off may have been\ndue a change in investor\u2019s\nviews regarding the\nconditions, investors are\nvulnerable to fears of\nan impending downturn\nand often turn to equity\nwith a record of strong\nperformance in terms\nof sustainable growth,\nclean balance sheets and\ngood cash flows. One\nsector which may meet\nthese conditions may be\nthe Telecomm sector.\nFirstly, the Telecomm\nsector has an increase in\ngrowth potential due to\nthe 5G data plan which\nTelecomm giants such\nas AT&T and Verizons\nare investing heavily\nin. Beyond that, the\nconsistently high dividend\nyields (5.5%) in 2018\nattract investors who are\nlooking for stability and\nsustainable returns amidst\nincreasingly chaotic\neconomic conditions.\nIn June 2018, I did\na stock pitch on AAPL\n(Apple stock) during\nwhich I proposed shorting\nthe AAPL stock due\nto how overvalued it\nwas. Taking the results\nfrom a Discounted\nCash Flow (DCF)\nanalysis and a Canonical\nCorrespondence Analysis\n(CCA), along with the\nlowered sales figure for\nthe latest iPhone and\niPad models, I concluded\nthat AAPL was likely to\nunderperform and drop in\nGoogle Finance // NASDAQ COMPOSITE\n// BMO\nWhich sector will prevail in the current market?\nU.S. economy (i.e. it has\nreached a peak).\nThe 2019 outlook for\ntechnologycompanystock\nwill likely be turbulent,\ndepending on which\npart of the tech sector a\ncompany is involved in.\nThe performance of tech\nstocks will depend on\ntheir innovation and their\nability to keep up with\ninvestor\u2019s expectations of\nhigh earnings.\n\u201cTrade friction\nhas a direct\nimpact on\nthe operating\nprofits of\ntechnology\ncompany\n[Apple]\u201d\nabsent with the yield\ncurve remaining flat and\nunemployment falling, it\nis reasonable to assume\nthat the U.S. economy\nwill not, barring any\nmajor eventualities go\ninto recession in 2019.\nDespite the current market\n\n"

This\ncaused waves of cash\nwithdrawals, hoarding\nand further economic\nwoes.\nAt the time, the country\nwas led by Hu Yaobang\na prominent reformist.\nHardliners, hating his\nmodernising attitude,\nousted him in January\n1987.\nWhen HuYaobang died\nsuddenly on 15th\nApril\n1989, students came out\nonto the streets celebrating him and his legacy.\nThey called for a return\nof the liberalism that his\ntime as General Secretary\nhad represented and for\nbroader reform, including\nmore democratic rights\nand investigations into\nthe corruption of Party\nofficials. Small gatherings\nof students around the\nMonument to the People\u2019s\nHeroes in Tiananmen\nsquare spontaneously\nstarted to form and grew\nover the next couple of\ndays.\nHu\u2019s state funeral was\nheld on 22nd\nApril. Over\n100,000 students came\nto Tiananmen square just\nnext to the Great Hall\nwhere the funeral was\nbeing held, despite orders\nfrom the government not\nto. The funeral was broadcast to students outside\nand many felt it was\nrushed and disrespectful.\nFrustrated students started\na class strike and rioting\nbroke out round the\ncountry.\nAfter this, Deng\nXiaoping endorsed a firm\nresponse and, on 26th\nApril, an editorial in the\nparty\u2019s official newspaper,\nentitled, \u201cIt is necessary\nto take a clear-cut stand\nagainst disturbances\u201d was\npublished. Rather than\nTiannmen Square protests // Independent\nE\narly Western\nexplorers to\nChina returned\ntelling stories\nabout a land of silk, jade\nand dragons. A whole\nartistic movement was\nbirthed, Orientalism, that\nimagined the East \u2013 in\nparticular China \u2013 as a\nsemi-real land more out of\nstory books than realism.\nThe ruling Communist\nParty seems determined\nto do the same thing in\nmodern China. However,\nunlike the past, the party\nwants to make its people\nbelieve the myth as well.\nA modern visitor to\nChina could be forgiven\nfor thinking that 4th\nJune\nis no different from any\nother day: the predictable\nrush hour roar of people\nheading to work or the\nshops belies the immense\nsuppression of thought\nthat is going on online.\nIn the past, suppressing\nideas in a populace was\ndifficult for a government.\nHow, other than breaking\ndown doors and confiscating dissident material,\ncould you modify patterns\nof thought? With the\nadvent of the internet,\nthe Chinese government\ngained the ability to filter\na large proportion of\ncommunication that goes\non between its citizens.\nCrucially, however, this\nis not done through heavy\nhanded laws preventing\nassembly. Instead, words,\nphrases and images can\nsimply be plucked out of\nthe information stream\nand prevented from ever\nbent over backwards to\naccommodate the desires\nand whims of the Communist Party. Google, the\ncompany whose informal\nmotto used to be \u201cDon\u2019t\nbe evil\u201d, has quietly\ndropped that commitment\nand invested significant\ntime and money into developing a search engine\nthat conformed to Chinese\ncensorship standards.\nChina is currently\nfighting an internal battle\nagainst the will of its\nown people. The events\nof 1989 prove that the\ndesires for democracy\nand accountability exist\nand are powerful impulses\npresent in China that are\nbeing supressed, rather\nthan simply a quirk of\nWestern life. The active\nsuppression of the\nmemory of Tiananmen\nSquare reveals a country\nterrified of its own people\nand its bloody past. Whilst\nthey have successfully su-pressed the memory of the\nlast upspring of democratic will and pacified their\npeople with economic\nbounty, the events of 4th\nJune 1989 will be repeated\nuntil China acknowledges\nits sins.\nThis week, we\nremember the people that\ndied at Tiananmen square\nin defiance of the government\nWhat Happened\nIn 1976, Mao Zedong\ndied, ending the Cultural\nRevolution that killed\nanywhere between\n400,000 to 10 million\npeople. Spearheaded by\nhim as a way to rapidly\nmodernise China, it\nresulted in widespread\npoverty and economic\nruin.\nTentative efforts\nthrough the 80\u2019s were\nonly partially successful\nand were exploited by\ncorrupt Party officials.\nThe effect of this\nexcising of history is\nsimilar to the effect of\na stroke on a relative:\nsuddenly their behaviour\nseems to make no sense.\nThey are scared of things\nof no consequence, grow\nangry without provocation and refuse to believe\nthat their view of the\nworld is wrong. They are\nworking off a different\nset of memories and experiences and processing\nthem differently to us. In a\nsituation like this, no one\nin their right mind would\nset aside everything that\nthey knew, remembered\nreaching an audience.\nThe difference is akin to\nthat between a boulder\nlobotomy and modern\nneurosurgical techniques.\nNowadays information\nregarding the Tiananmen\nSquare protests in 1989,\nof which we are now\ncommemorating the 30th\nanniversary, is almost\nimpossible to come by in\nChina. In previous years,\ncensorship has been so\nfervent in erasing any suggestion of the event, they\nhave prevented even the\nword \u2018today\u2019 being used.\nThe effect of this on the\npopulation has been collective amnesia. Without\nany information available,\nchildren not alive at the\ntime have no awareness\nof their history. Parents\nchoose not to teach their\nchildren because it is too\ncomplicated a burden to\nplace on them, and those\nwho were there live under\nthe Sword of Damocles\n\u2013 always at risk of being\npulled off the street\nand being disappeared.\nFormer student leaders,\nsuch as Chai Ling, often\nchose to flee the country\nrather than risk imprison-ment.\nthis is what we are at risk\nof doing. Britain during\nthe Cameron years courted\nChina furiously, inviting\nXi Jinping to come and\ndine with the Queen,\ninviting Chinese companies to purchase stakes in\nour nuclear power plants\nand, in our particular\ncase, inviting ever more\nstudents to come to study\nin our universities. George\nOsborne, at the time,\ntalked about the unique\nconnection that Britain\nand China shared and\nabout the exciting future\nprojects we shall undertake together. All this was\nbased on the assumption\nthat engaging with China\nwould encourage it to\nbecome more western\nin its outlook and more\nliberal in the treatment\nof its people. This has\nproven to be false.\nPresident Xi has not\nmoved to liberalise his\ncountry. Instead, he has\ndoubled down, consolidating power and reaffirming\nthe repressive messages\nof the past. Instead, we\nin the West have moved\ntowards China in outlook.\nOur companies have\n\u201cThe difference\nbetween\na boulder\nlobotomy\nand modern\nneurosurgical\ntechniques\u201d\nand believed and join in\nthe delusions of the sick.\nUnfortunately, I believe\nCOMMENT\nFRIDAY, 31ST\nMAY, 2019 FELIX\n7\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPAARRY launch\nDaniel Wigh writes about the launch of Political Action Against Rape Required Yesterday\nCOMMENT\nDaniel Wigh\nComment Writer\nC\na m p a i g n e r s\nacross the world\nhave brought the\nissue of sexual\nmisconduct into the spotlight in recent years and it\nhas become apparent that\nitisaproblemeverywhere,\nincluding at Imperial. In\nan institutional culture\nreport about Imperial from\n2016, researchers found\nthat: \u201cDespite Imperial\u2019s\n\u2018no tolerance\u2019 stance on\nharassment and bullying\n(\u2026) women in particular\nreported being silenced in\nvarious ways.\u201d\nImperial College\nLondon is currently reviewing their policy for\nhow sexual misconduct is\ndealt with in a designated\nworking group, after\nhaving sought advice and\nrecommendations from an\nexternal expert - a commendable step. However,\nthere are no permanent\nmembers of this working\ngroup who are students\nor sabbatical officers, and\nthis limits student input.\nIn November 2017\nFelix brought an article\nthat, among other things,\nhighlighted that a person\nhad been found in breach\nof Imperial\u2019s sexual\nmisconduct policy but\nwas allowed to remain in\na position of responsibility within a society. The\nUnion\u2019s policy has since\nbeen changed (by us), with\n>95% of Union Council\nvoting in favour of the\nrule changes. However,\ndespite vigilant efforts,\nit was only in January\n2019 that the new by-law\nclauses were finalised, 14\nmonths after the issue was\ninitially raised. We must\nfind a solution to prevent\nthese delays.\nWe believe Imperial\nshould have a campaign\ngroup dedicated entirely\nto raising awareness and\nensuring that the student\nvoice is heard on this\nimportant issue, while\nmaking the path from\nidea to action easier -something that is clearly\nneeded.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re\nstarting PAARRY: Political Action Against Rape\nRequired Yesterday. In\ncase you\u2019re wondering\nabout the name, it\u2019s a play\non words: parry is a term\nfrom fencing which means\n\u201cto ward off an attack with\na countermove\u201d.\nWe want to:\n\u2022 Arrange events across\nImperial to decrease\nprevalence and\nincrease awareness of\nsexual misconduct on\ncampus.\n\u2022 Ensure that the\nCollege\u2019s new disciplinary framework\nhas the students\u2019 best\ninterest in mind, by\ncreating a forum for\nstudents to discuss\nit and collectively campaign for\nchanges.\n\u2022 Influence the adaptation of the College\u2019s\nnew framework into\nthe Union.\n\u2022 Get involved in the\nnation-wide debate.\nIn order for the idea\nto become recognised\nas an official Imperial\nCampaign group we need\nyour support! if you agree\nwith our message please\nshow your support by\nsigning up on the Union\nwebsite or by using the\nQR code below\ncowing the students, it\nenraged them and protests\nonly grew larger. The next\nday 50,000 \u2013 100,000\nstudents marched through\nBeijing to Tiananmen\nSquare and received widespread public support.\nThis march was\nhugely successful and\nthe government\u2019s tone\nturned conciliatory. In a\nspeech, the government\ncalled the movement\n\u201cpatriotic\u201d, negating the\nmessage of the 26th\nApril\neditorial. This pacified\nmany students who began\nto lose interest.\nIn order to regain\nmomentum the student\nleaders organised a hunger\nstrike. It was widely\npopular and, by 13th\nMay,\nthere were 300,000 people\ngathered in Tiananmen\nSquare. By 17th\nMay, over\na million Beijing residents\nhad demonstrated solidarity with the protesters and\n400 protests of various\nsizes sprung up in other\ncities. Foreign journalists\nalso began sending news\nof the protests to the rest\nof the world, causing the\nleadership to worry about\nhow it looked abroad.\nOn 19th\nMay Deng\nXiaoping made the\ndecision that martial law\nwould be declared. By the\nnext day, 250,000 soldiers\nwere sent to the capital.\nWhen they tried to enter\nthe suburbs they were surrounded by crowds that\nmade any further advance\nimpossible. Demonstrators climbed on the\nvehicles and soldiers were\ngiven food and shelter.\nOn 24th\nMay, the troops\nwere withdrawn to the\ndelight of the protesters.\nHowever, across the\ncountry, plans were being\ndrawn up for an assault.\nBy 3rd\nJune, plans were\nfinalised. While they\ndid not contain explicit\norders to shoot-to-kill,\nAt about 10:30pm,\nthe army was halted at\nMuxidi where a bridge\nhad been blocked with\nburning busses. 36 people\nare confirmed to have died\nhere, though this number\nis thought to be low.\nTroops advanced\nfurther into the city, firing\nindiscriminately, killing\nboth demonstrators and\nonlookers. Doctors that\nwent to treat the wounded\nwere also shot and killed.\nDemonstrators tried to\nform barricades, human\nchains, negotiate or fight\nback but, in each case,\nthey were pushed back\nwith armoured personnel\ncarriers running over barricades and demonstrators\nand negotiators, such as\nDuan Changlong, were\nshot as they tried to reason\nwith troops.\nBetween 10:30pm and\nmidnight, news began to\ntrickle back to the demonstrators in the square.\nAt this point, there were\nbetween 70,000-80,000 in\nthe square.\nBy 2:00am, the square\nwas sealed off with\nsoldiers blocking all entrances and firing on any\nreinforcements that were\nattempting to enter the\nsquare.\nDespite the clear\nthreat to their lives, the\nstudents didn\u2019t renounce\nnon-violence. The leaders\nof the movement even\nconfiscated sticks, rocks\nand guns in an effort to\nprevent further escalation.\nAt 04.30, after negotiation between student\nleaders and government\nforces, the troops marched\nup to within ten metres of\nthe students and set up\nmachine guns pointing at\nthe students.\nThere are reports of\ntroops firing into the\ncrowd, though this is\nunconfirmed. What is\nknown is that, at 5:00 am,\nstudents were allowed to\nmove out of the square\nthrough a corridor opened\nby the soldiers. Again,\nthough hotly disputed,\nsome have alleged that\nthese students, who\nthought they had been\ngiven a chance to live\nwalked into prepared\nmachine gun nests.\nWhile this marked the\nend of the main incident,\nstudents walking near the\nsquare later in the day\nwere shot at and killed and\nan ambulance was caught\nin the cross fire.\nThe next day, 5th\nJune\nthe famous photo of tanks\nleaving Tiananmen square\nbeing blocked by a man\ncarrying a shopping bag\nwas taken.\nThe death toll remains\ncontroversial.TheChinese\nRed Cross has estimated\nthat 2700 people died but\nthis number is contradicted by a British diplomatic\ncable, which has alleged\nthat the number was at\nleast 10,000.\n\u201cTroops were\ntold to\u2018use\nany means\nnecessary\u2019\u201d\ntroops were told to \u201cuse\nany means to clear impediments\u201d which was\ninterpreted as permission\nby many units.\nAt 10pm on 4th\nJune,\ntroops moved into\nBeijing. While they initially only fired into the\nair, when soldiers came\nup against barricades,\nthey turned their guns on\nthe demonstrators. Troops\nused expanding dum-dum\nbullets, so called because\nthey expand upon hitting\na body causing massive\ninternal trauma.\n\n"

Rosie\nshowed images of a\ntechnique they use in Bali\ncalled \u201cpasung\u201d, which\nentails the shackling of\npeople showing signs of\npsychological disabilities\nin order to restrain them\nin isolation. Although\nbanned in 1977, she explained that the practise is\nnot well regulated in rural\nareas and that it remains\nregularly carried out, both\nin formal institutions and\nin a domestic setting.\nRosie\u2019s talk went on to\nshow a case study of a man\nwho underwent Pasung\nfor 12 years, before his\nfamily were approached\nby community workers\nand taught how to better\napproach mental health\nillnesses and the treatment for them, including\ntherapy and medication.\nThe man went on to be\nthe breadwinner for the\nfamily after successful\ntreatment, proving that\ncommunity schemes are\nimproving the wellbeing\nof mental health patients\nin Bali.\nRosie will be heading\nto Indonesia herself this\nsummer to undertake a\nPhD placement in a psychiatric facility in Bali,\nand is currently raising\nfunds for this.

However, this increased financial support\nfor the service has failed\nto translate to increased\nsupport for the students\ndue to the persisting issue\nof finding increased space\non campus for the service.\nClaire explained this\nto Felix, stating: \u201cLast\nsummer, we were allocated in the budget three\nfull-time equivalent coun-sellors, which is positive;\nbut, consequently, we\nweren\u2019t given or allocated\nthe space to go with the\nresource.\u201d Claire went\non to describe how the\nservice has attempted to\nnavigate these challenges:\n\u201cWe tried to think creatively and we went ahead\nand we\u2019ve recruited. We\ncouldn\u2019t recruit for the\nthree full-time because\nwe haven\u2019t got the space.\nWe rented some rooms in\nSALC [the Seminar and\nLearning Centre], which\naren\u2019t ideal because\u2026\nthey\u2019re meeting rooms.\nThey\u2019ve got meeting room\nfurniture, counsellors\nup there are constantly\ninterrupted by people just\nwalking into the rooms,\nand you might have distressed students in there.\u201d\nThe importance of an\nadequate, professional\nspace in which both the\nstudent and counsellor\nfeel comfortable can\u2019t\nbe overstated, as Claire\nand Mark stressed to\nFelix: \u201cJust like a doctor\nneeds a consulting room\nor a surgeon needs an\noperating theatre, mental\nhealth professionals need\na professional space that\nrespects the student in\nsupporting them. It\u2019s\nabout us feeling that we\nare grounded and can offer\nthat professional support\nbecause we\u2019re talking\nwith students about what\u2019s\ndistressing them or what\nthey\u2019re concerned about\nand you don\u2019t want to be\ninterrupted.\u201d However,\nthe vital importance of\nsuch a room is often\n\u201cmisunderstood\u201d because\ncounselling and mental\nhealth advice is often seen\nas \u201cjust a chat\u201d. This is\nvehemently not the case.\nSpeaking specifically\nabout the Mental Health\nAdvisory service, Mark\ncontested: \u201cWe offer a\nskilled conversation with\na mental health profes-sional. We refer people on\nif we need to or we liaise\nwith GPs. I think the main\nthing we do is try to see\npeople through their time\nhere and offer a check-in.\u201d\nThe requirements for a\nprofessional counselling\nspace, which include\nsoundproofing, privacy\nand natural light, as well\nas somewhere that is\nconsistently available, so\nstudents \u201cknow the same\nspace or room they\u2019re\nturning up to\u201d, and somewhere that feels safe for\nthe students that\u2019s not\ndirectly in their academic\nfaculty where they can be\nseen going in or accessing\nsupport. Claire explained,\n\u201cif you\u2019re with a student\nthat\u2019s very distressed or\nvery depressed, being in a\nbasement or a windowless\nroom is not good\u201d.\nis very difficult\u201d, Mark\ntold Felix. Another difficulty that has presented\nitself is the fact that,\ndespite the fact that the\nservice is part of Imperial,\nit needs to \u201csot a little\nbit separate\u201d, in order\nto provide students with\nsome separation from\ntheir day-to-day routine.\nThis spacing issue has\neffectively left the service\ndown on resourcing,\ndespite being allocated\nextra resources. As Mark\nconcisely puts it, it\u2019s akin\nto having \u201cmore surgeons\nbut no more operating\ntheatres\u201d. Despite compromising by making\nuse of meeting rooms in\nSALC in an attempt to\n\u201cput the students first\u201d,\nthis has done little to\nimprove the situation for a\ncounselling service facing\never increasing footfall.\nRecent research suggests\nthat there has been a\n50% UK-wide increase\nin student demand for\nmental health services and\nImperial is no exception.\nClaire told Felix, \u201cwe\u2019ve\nso far seen just over 1300\nstudents \u2013 that\u2019s combined\nwith both teams \u2013 this\nacademic year.\" These\nstudents are \"across all\nfaculties, all departments,\nall levels, from undergraduate to postdoc to\nresearch\". This is already\nan increase on the 1013\nstudents that accessed\nthe Student Counselling\nand Mental Health\nAdvice service in the\n2016/17 academic year\nand represents alleged\n12% and 50% increases\nin the number of students\naccessing the Counselling\nand Mental Health Advice\nservices, respectively,\ncompared to last year.\n\u201cBy the time we get to the\nend of this academic year,\nit\u2019s going to be 60% up on\nlast year\u201d, predicts Mark.\nThis increased demand,\ncoupled with the restricted\nresourcing, has had a predictably detrimental effect\non waiting times. Students\naccessing the Counselling\nService will have an initial\nassessment, following\nwhich they will receive\ncounselling, if deemed\nappropriate. Students\nthen have access to seven\ncounselling sessions for\nthe year in what is referred\nto as a \u201cbrief therapeutic\nmodel\u201d \u2013 the majority of\nthe students will make use\nof four of these sessions,\nwhich is in line with\nthe national average for\nuniversities. Last year, the\nwait time between initial\nassessment and counselling was reported to be\nseven weeks. This year,\nthat is up to eight weeks.\nThe service determines\nwho to see first based on\nneed, ensuring the most\nvulnerable students are\nseen the quickest; time\nspent on the waiting list\nis also taken into account\nto prevent those with\nlower-level problems\nbeing left indefinitely. It\nis also important to note\nthat, if a student discloses\nrisk \u2013 which they can do\nvia email or on the online\nCounselling Referral form\n\u2013 there is a duty counsellor that works to expedite\nsaid student\u2019s assessment,\nif appropriate.\nAlthough the system for\nthe Mental Health Advice\nservice is very different,\nits similarly disappointing\nwaiting time is also a\nreflection of the increased\nstudent demand and inadequate resourcing. Mark\nexplained to Felix: \u201cStaff\noften phone us, so we talk\nto staff about students a\nlot, often anonymously.\nWe do that continually;\nthere\u2019s obviously no wait\nfor that but, if a student\nis referred, we always\nendeavour to see the\nstudent within a working\nweek. However we\u2019re not\nachieving that, we\u2019re just\nabsolutely not. These are\nquite important referrals;\nit\u2019s important enough for\na student to have gone to\ntheir tutor and it\u2019s important enough for the tutor to\nhave been concerned and\nfeeling that they can\u2019t sort\nit, that it needs someone\nwith some mental health\nexpertise, so they are all\nquite urgent\u201d. Again, it is\nimportant to note that, in\nthis case, if a referral flags\nup significant distress,\nthere will often be a\nresponse within 24 hours.\nThere are many theories\nbehind why there has\nbeen an observed increase\nin student demand for\nmental health services, including a reduced stigma\n\u201cIt's a\ncontaining\nanchor space\u201d\naround mental health\nleading to people being\nmore comfortable talking\nabout it. Claire concurs,\nsaying: \u201cMental health is\nbecoming less of a taboo.\nIt\u2019s being spoken about,\nit\u2019s in the press, the stigma\nis greatly diminishing and\nthat\u2019s healthy and that\u2019s\nhow it should be. With\nthe media talking about\nmental health more, it\u2019s on\neverybody\u2019s agenda. With\nthat, there\u2019s an increase\nin demand.\u201d One factor\nthat could also explain\nthe increase observed at\nImperial is the introduction of the Counselling\nservice\u2019s online self-refer-ral form. This came in at\nthe start of this academic\nyear and allows students\neasier and quicker access\nto the service, leading to\nan inevitable increase in\nthe number of referrals.\nAnother contributing\nfactor, and perhaps the\nlargest, is the academic\npressure and widely\nperceived competitive\nculture that exists at\nRussell Group universities like Imperial. Claire\nexplained: \u201cThis College\ndraws a certain type of\nstudent that is very gifted\nor very academically able\nand talented and, with\nthat, a lot of students want\nto do well and are used\nto doing well; that\u2019s part\nof their identity, it\u2019s part\nof how they see them-selves. When you have a\nwhole cohort of students\ncoming, that are all very\ngifted and very bright and\nvery driven\u2026 you get\nthis culture where there is\nacademic competition and\nthat then creates internally\nwithin students a pressure\nto compete. Sometimes,\nwhen that gets a bit dis-torted, they can become\nquite self-critical and\nquite punitive.\u201d Shervin\nSabeghi,incomingDeputy\nPresident (Welfare) for\n2019/20, told Felix: \u201cIt\u2019s\nhard to deny that there is\nan air of competition but\nI think it\u2019s more about the\nway people respond to\nthat\u201d. When the question\nof whether it is the university\u2019s duty to tackle this\nculture was put to them,\nboth Claire and Mark\nagreed that considering\nit a \u201cdual responsibility\u201d\nis the \u201chealthy way\u201d to\napproach the issue. \u201cIt\nshould be both the student\ntaking ownership and\nresponsibility for their\nown mental health and\npsychological wellbeing\nand obviously the College\nhas a duty of care as well\u201d,\nClaire added. \u201cWhat they\nare trying to think about\nis what they are in control\nof in terms of adding extra\npressure. Conversations\naround when exams are\nsat, how many should be\nput into a week, the stuff\nthat the university is in\ncontrol of\u201d. The example\nof the College taking\nmeasures so as not to exacerbate pre-exam and exam\ntime pressure and stress is\nparticularly pertinent as\nthe Counselling service\nsees spikes during these\nperiods, often made worse\nby the exam schedule.\nIt\u2019s easy to see the\nissues facing the Student\nCounselling & Mental\nHealth advice service as\na problem which only\naffects students but, with\nrecent research showing\nthat employees are three\ntimes more likely to\ndiscuss physical ailments\nover mental health issues\nat work, it is important to\nalso highlight the affect\nthat these persisting issues\nhave on staff. Mark explained to Felix: \u201cWe\u2019ve\ngot a very experienced,\nprofessionally qualified\nteam here with huge\namounts of experience\nin dealing with students\u2019\nmental health and hugely\nexperienced counsellors.\nWe\u2019re passionate about\nwhat we\u2019re doing, we\nwant to provide the best\ncare and to not be able to\ndo that in a timely way\nis very frustrating for us;\nthe biggest effect on us\nis frustration. Our overall\nfeeling is frustration\nbecause we can\u2019t quite\ndo what we want to do\nand what we\u2019re able\nto do.\u201d This effect has\nbeen noticed by students\ninteracting with these\nstaff, particularly those\ninvolved in the Union\u2019s\nWellbeing Representation\nNetwork.\nthrough in the provision\nfor the Student Counselling & Mental Health\nAdvice service. According to Claire, Hannah\nBannister [Director of\nStudent Services] has been\n\u201creally endeavouring and\nworking hard to try and\nfind space\u201d. At the time of\nwriting, a potential space\non the Hammersmith\ncampus which could be\nconverted into two very\nsmall consulting rooms\nis under site review. If\nthe space is found to be\nviable, the process will\nbe expedited such that it\nis made available for 1st\nAugust. Question marks\nstillsurroundtheprovision\nof mental health support\nacross campuses, particularly with the College\u2019s\nexpansion into White\nCity, but this development\ncould mark the start of an\nupturn in fortunes for the\ncounselling service.\nClaire ended the discussion with Felix with\nthe following important\nmessage: \u201cOne of the first\nthings I say to a student\nwhen I\u2019m with them in\nthat kind of session is\nit takes a lot of bravery\nsometimes to come and\nsit with a stranger, albeit\na mental health profes-sional, a counsellor in a\nconfidential space, it takes\nsome courage. Accessing\nmental health or counselling support is a sign\nof strength. It\u2019s a sign of\nstrength because you\u2019re\nactually prioritising\nyourself\u201d.\nAlthough the wider\nissue of how space is\nmanaged within College\npersists, there may have\nbeen a recent break-Claire went on to\nexplain that, when\nbooking rooms, priority\nis given to the academic\nschools, especially with\nmeeting rooms. As a\nresult, the choices left\navailable to the Student\nCounselling & Mental\nHealth service is limited.\n\u201cI think the difficulty\nwe\u2019ve encountered is each\nfaculty feels it owns its\nown space\u2026 and to break\ninto the wider institution\n\n"

    "content": "Dog Without Feathers\nT\nransport yourself\nto the dried-out\nCapibaribe River\nin north-eastern\nBrazil, where \u2018crab men\u2019\ncovered in mud desperately try to survive the harsh,\nviolent environment,\nwhere water is scarce and\nlife is returned to its primal\norigins. Dog Without\nFeathers is a virtuostic\ndance production by the\naward-winning choreographer Deborah Colker.\nBased on Joao Cabral de\nMelo Neto\u2019s poem Dog\nWithout Feathers, the\nexperimental dance-cum-film embodies the poem\nin movement, whilst\ncombining classical, contemporary and ritualistic\ndances in an intense and\npassionate manner. It\nbrings even the desolate,\ncracking landscape into\nmotion, in a spectacular\nfashion I did not know\npossible.\nThe visceral performance immerses the\naudience into life on the\nedge, with the mythology of people living on\nBrazil\u2019s Capibaribe River\nseamlessly intertwined\nwith suffering and\ntragedy. With the dancers\u2019\nskin-coloured costumes\nand mud-slicked hair,\ntheir dehumanisation is\nembodied through their\nprimal passion. Their\ncontrasting anguish and\nexuberance speaks of our\ndependence and careless\ndisregard for nature and\nour environment, whilst\nalso highlighting the\ninequalities of Brazilian\nlife. Through this, Colker\neffectively conceptualizes\nboth geographical and\nhuman nature. The performance speaks to a deeper\npart of the audience\u2019s soul,\nasking us to contemplate\nthe inconceivable and\nunimaginable aspects of\nthe human condition.\nWe were brought on a\njourney from the dried-out river banks, to a lone\ncrab, to the sugarcane\nplantations, and to a\nmangrove teeming with\nlife. The simple set design\nand black-and-white\nfilm reflected the empty\nand deprived landscape,\nallowing us to focus on\nthe dancers themselves.\nThis was exemplified by\nthe lighting design that\ncast brilliant and effective\nshadows, transporting\nus into a different world.\nWithin each movement,\nthe dancers were intense\nand powerful, moving\nin perfect synchrony to\nembody the scene and\nbring the audience on an\nadventure as the poem\nwas transversed.\nThe beautiful, fluid\nshapes created by the\ndancers were deliberately\ncontrasted with their\nperfectly timed and harsh\nmovements, highlighting\nthe guttural nature of these\ncommunities that were in\nperfect synchrony with\nthe raw beauty of nature.\nWhilst filled with\npassion and drama, there\nwere points where some\nof the intense energy lost\nits way and seemed to\ndrag on. Perhaps this was\nintentional, reflecting the\npeople\u2019s return to basic requirements and the loss of\nenergy as their struggled\nto survive the long days\nand months. However, it\nalso took away from the\ncaptivating world they\nhad worked so hard to\ntransport us to. Nonetheless, the world created is\none that leaves you contemplating human nature\nand our environment.\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised at how\neffective dance is as a\ncommunication tool that\ntranscends all languages\nand practices, and gave\nme a newfound appreciation of the ways in which\nwe can express ourselves.\nThe performance beautifully combined cinema,\npoetry, music and dance to\ntransport the audience into\na different, enthralling\nworld. At the same time,\nit effectively delivered\na pertinent message on\nhumanity and nature, and\nleft us reflecting on our\nown lives and practices.\nOperation Black Antler\nS\nitting alone in the\ndark, on a bench\nin a South London\npark waiting for a\ntext from my \u2018handler\u2019, I\nfelt as though I had found\nmyself at the blunt end of\nthe biggest practical joke\nsince the admin team at\nthe 2017 Oscars switched\nthe winner\u2019s envelopes.\nInstructed to remain vigilant for any \u2018suspicious\nactivity\u2019, it\u2019s fair to say\nthat I was absolutely\nbricking it! Eventually,\nhowever, the rest of my\nteam arrived and after a\nbrief introduction we did\nindeed receive instructions from our handler.\nOperation Black Antler\nis an immersive theatre\nexperience, and this really\nwas whatever you made of\nit.

By\nthe end of the evening, I\nhad sympathised with a\nLuton based Anti-Islamic\nprotester and arranged\na meeting the following\nSaturday with the head of\nthe EDL \u2013 not my usual\nThursday evening out!\nAs a piece of theatre,\nthis evening was faultless.\nI spent the entire evening\nunable to differentiate\nbetween actors, members\nof the public and fellow\nguests.\nIf you are someone\nwho feels uncomfortable\ntalking to strangers, who\nis overly cautious about\nwhat you say, or who is\nuneasy about breaking\ninto fenced compounds\nbehind gymnasia, then\nperhaps give this a miss.\nHowever, if you are\nthe sort of person who\nreads MI5 biographies\nand watches Line of\nDuty thinking \u2018I wonder\nwhether I could do that?\u2019,\nthen this is certainly for\nyou!

    "content": "Life, Love and Robots: A Conversation\nARTS\nAmanda Hertzberg\nArts Writer\nT\nhe exhibition\n\u2018AI: More\nThan Human\u2019\n(explored in\nthe previous issue of\nFelix) is taking place at\nthe Barbican right now,\nwhere visitors can explore\nthe topic of artificial\nintelligence and machine\nlearning, spanning back\nto the Middle Ages, then\njumping to 1940\u2019s Alan\nTuring to today\u2019s newest\ngimmicks in the field. In\nmy eyes, the exhibition\ngives rise to more questions than it does answers.\nIn an attempt to answer\nsome of these questions, I\nspoke to Takashi Ikegami,\nprofessor at the University\nof Tokyo and one of the\nmain (human) brains\nbehind Alter 3.\nHi Takashi! Your\nbackground is a\ndoctorate in Physics,\nand today you have\nyour own AI lab in\nTokyo, Japan. How\ncome your career took\nthis turn, were you\nalways interested in\nAI?\nBasically, I am interested in what life is. People,\nor even physicists like\nSchr\u00f6dinger, the father of\nquantum mechanics, want\nto know why some matter\nbecomes life, and some\nmatter doesn\u2019t, and what\nthe distinction between\nthe two is. Then came the\npersonal computer back in\nthe 80\u2019s, and now everybody has a computer.\nThere\u2019s still so many\nthings to discover, and\nthat\u2019s how I started doing\nsystems studies. We didn\u2019t\ncall it AI, we call it \u201cA(rtifical) Life\u201d, life comes\nfirst, intelligence might\ncome as a by-product or a\nside effect.\nWhat would you\ndefine as life?\nWell it\u2019s a difficult\nquestion, but humans are\nthe ones who decide what\nis and isn\u2019t life. We came\nup with the Turing test.\nThe Turing test is a more\nlanguage based distinction between human and\nnon-human. You interact\nwith an android and judge\nhow human-like they are.\nIt\u2019s based on a lot more\nthan just appearance,\nbut once you think you\ncould be in love with her/\nhim, and you don\u2019t care\nwhether it\u2019s a machine or\nnot, that\u2019s when we\u2019ve\nreached the goal.\nWould you say there is\nartificial intelligence\nthat meets this\nstandard already?\nWell, people don\u2019t\nreally know what artificial\nintelligence is. Already,\ncomputers can calculate\nmuch faster than humans,\nbut people shouldn\u2019t\ncall it AI. It\u2019s difficult\nbecause people call what\nis essentially just machine\nlearning AI. So we\u2019re not\nat that level yet.\nDo you think we\u2019ll\nknow when we get\nthere?\nHopefully. But I\u2019m\nnot sure. Like I said, on\nsome level people don\u2019t\ncare what something is\nmade out of, whether it\u2019s\na computer programme\nor not. When you become\nfriends with someone,\nyou don\u2019t just suddenly\nstop liking them or stop\nbeing friends with them\nbecause they consist of a\nprogramme. That\u2019s why\nartificial life is more important than artificial in-telligence. Artificial life is\nmore about how you can\ninteract with the mind, if\nthere is such a thing as the\nmind. Mind can emerge\non top of computational\nprocesses and chemical\nprocesses.\nYou are part of the\nteam that created\nAlter 3, which can\nbe seen here at the\nBarbican right now\nas part of the \u201cAI:\nMore than Human\u201d\nexhibition. Would you\ndescribe that as life?\nWe don\u2019t call it life,\nbut we do think it is a\ndifferent type of robot. It\u2019s\nan alternative robot in the\nsense that it is not based\non the task, it\u2019s not based\non computational func-tions, instead it is based\non artificial life principles.\nAlter 3 has been given\nthe basic task to mimic a\nhuman being. If a person\nsteps up in front of Alter\n3, he will try to mimic the\nperson, but also to consult\nhis memory of behaviours\nto try and pick up and\nmatch the human in front\nof him. He will try to\nretrieve past behaviours\nfrom his memory.\nSo Alter 3 shows\nmachine learning?\nAlter 3 shows machine\nlearning, yes, but the basic\nprocesses behind it we\ncall Darwinian evolution,\npicking up one pose and\nmaking a variation of it,\nattached to the memory.\nSo a memory organisation\nis built. The personality of\nAlter 3 arises from these\ncomplex memory-tree\nstructures.\nDo you feel like you\nhave a personal\nrelationship with Alter\n3?\nYeah, I do think so. The\nmore time you spend with\nAlter, the more you start\nto like him. I feel like I\nwant to know more about\nhim.\nTakashi, you are\nobviously a scientist,\nbut do you consider\nyourself an artist as\nwell?\nYeah I consider\nmyself an artist after 5\npm. When you conduct\nscientific research, you\nhave to produce papers\nfor journals, and that\u2019s\nwhat everything revolves\naround. However, there\u2019s\na lot of things you can\u2019t\nshow through simple\nfigures and numbers. Art\nis a totally different way\nto present these ideas to\npeople, and can be easily\nunderstood.\nIn your work you\u2019ve\nstated the theory that\nthe mind emerges\nfrom mass flow of\ndata. Would you\nsay this school of\nthought makes you\ndifferent from other\nresearchers in the\nfield that might take\na more reductionist\napproach?\nYeah, usually people\nthink life emerges from\nneural networks. One of\nmy theories is based on\nthe work of artist Nam\nJune Paik. Usually you\nbuild a robot in a laborato-ry-setting and you experiment on it there. But Paik\ntook the robot to the city.\nAnd in the city the robot\nwas hit by a car, and then\nbecame the first robot to\never have been involved\nin a traffic accident. The\nworld is so messy, so\ncomplex, and that\u2019s the\nchallenge you\u2019re really\nfacing in all of this. I think\nthe difference between\nAlter 3 and other robots\nhas to do with its complex\nenvironment. Autonomy\nis not performing random\nacts regardless of what\u2019s\ngoing on in the environ-ment, life-like autonomy\nis interacting with your\nenvironment. The mind\nis not encapsulated in the\nbody, the mind is constantly interacting with\nthe environment. Alter 3\nis not trying to stop the\nmassive data flow, instead\nto receive it all and be\nmore adaptive towards it.\nWhere do you see\nartificial intelligence\ngoing in the next\ndecade?\nThe market needs more\nrobot-to-robot interaction.\nIt might be interesting for\ncreating a new kind of\nmathematics. I always\nthink of the human as a\nbottleneck. With big data,\nAI don\u2019t need to visualise\nand write down equations\nlike we do. They just go\nfrom big data to big data,\nbypassing the rest. They\ncan therefore create their\nown mathematics and\nown languages. How\nwe understand things is\ndifferent from how AI\nunderstands things, so\nwe need better translation\nbetween these two.\nAfter talking to\nIkegami I\u2019m left pondering about AI and the\ndefinition of life. Could\nthe future really contain\nsome sort of Ex Machina-style androids for us\nto fall in love with? Will a\nversion of Alter 3 one day\nbe someone I come home\nto find on the couch,\neating Ben & Jerry\u2019s and\nwatching Love Island?\nI can\u2019t help but view\nTakashi Ikegami as a bit\nof a Victor Frankenstein,\nperhaps a misunderstood\ngenius, but so devoted to\nhis craft of creating life\nthat this might not be the\nlast we hear from him.\nFollowing on from last week\u2019s feature on AI: More Than Human, Arts Writer Amanda interviews the father of the\nexhibition\u2019s humanoid robot: Alter 3.\nMeet Alter 3 (left) and his human creator (right) // Anna Dabrowski, Barbican\nISSUE 1723\nFELIX\n10\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
