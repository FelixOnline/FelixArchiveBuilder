    "content": "L Dear Sir\nRecently, students at Imperial\nCollege have seen the formation\nof the Anti-Apartheid Group. Formed in response to the Boat\nClub visit to South Africa, the\nGroup have frequently ex pressed their collective feelings\nin FELIX, so, as the Editor hinted last week, it is now our\nturn.\nI suspect that when the issue\nof South Africa is raised, many\nstudents are inclined to dismiss\nthe subject as irrelevant. There\nis, of course, that body of students who look to South Africa for future employment,\nbut I will not concern myself\nwith them here.\nIn Britain today we find racial\nproblems occur ing more and more frequently. Indeed, as Britain moves towards a multi-racial community we will all become more aware of ethnic\ngroups, and hopefully, the problems they face in adjusting\n( and helping us adjust) to a new way of life.\nIt is surely in this light that\nany racial issue raised in our College should be viewed. The injustice we see in South Africa\ncan be found in this count r^, albeit greatly diminished. Part\nof the problem is that many\npeople do not realise just how close to home the effects of\nracism can be found, and I believe this leads to disregard,\nif not ignorance, of situations\nabroad.\nCertainly, some people may\nfeel that active opposition to\nracism is a leftist province and hence taboo, but I suggest that\nwe should swallow our pride,\nbe prepared to side with those\nof different (political) persuasions\nand get on with the job of fighting injustice everywhere. Ido not necessarily advocate dropping our lecture notes (or\nrevision notes!) and making for\nthe nearest rally, but at least\nthink about and discuss such\nissues as racism, and try to attend Union General Meetings\nin order to hear and contribute\nto informed debate.\nIt is often said at IC that the\nUnion's function should not include politics; that is for its\nmembers to decide, but I believe our Union should take\nan active interest in social affairs that directly affect us and the world we live in. Yours faithfully\nPaul Baron\nPhysics 2\nDear Colin\nIn reply to Sean O 'Boyle's letter of last week I would say\nthat grass is definitely not harder than concrete and he's very silly to think so. In fact,\ngrass isn't so hard as concrete\n\u2014 not by a long chalk (which\nalso isn't as hard as concrete\n\u2014 ho,h o) and people can badly cut themselves falling on concrete, whereas grass has soothing properties.\nIn fact, I'd love to see a Beit\nQuad of open grass \u2014 a veritable wilderness like prairie of\nthe stuff where a man can stride out and build a log cabin\nof his own and raise a herd of\ncattle and a family. How we\nmust bemoan the loss of this\nlast untamed plain, probably with disastrous ecological consequences for species like\nthe Beit Quad Dingo and the\nelusive Darwin's hawk which\nled Charles Darwin to his theory of evolution.\nSo I would urge a campaign\nto preserve this last bit of un concrete dIC and defend it\nfrom the weirdos like O 'Boyle.\nYours David Attenborough\nDavid Bellamy\nRichard Attenborough\nJohn Evans\nMews Residents\nLunatic Fringe\nPrivate Detective\nDear Editor and all\nHaving just read this term's Felicies, my comments must be\nthus: Sorry Annie but even\nsarcasm will not stop mr justice\nold ground I tried it last June, with little apparent success.

'It seemed to me that a very\nsubstantial number of IC students found enjoyment in making an utter\nfarce out of an important and potentially very volatile situation.\"\nHe went on to write that \" Not only were they putting over views in a completely irrational and disgraceful manner by jeering at Iranian\nprotestors, like some rioting school kids, but they also succeeded in\ndrawing the attention of the world's media in the process. There is no\nbetter way to damage the reputation of Imperial College, than to display\nourselves in such a stupid, un civilised and ignorant way.\"\nIC students kneel in\nKensington Gardens during a 'mock prayer' session\nThe anti-Ayatollah demonstrators asked that it\nshould be made clear that their demonstration was\nintended to show disapproval of a regime which is\n\"inhumane and irresponsible.\" They said that they did\nnot want to let the world believe that the British\npeople would stand by without showing disapproval of\nsuch actions. \"If the Iranians have the right to support\nthe Khomeini regime, then likewise we have a right to\nprotest. The student who feels sickened by the\nmanner of the protest should perhaps consider the\nchants and slogans of the Iranian demonstrators and\nthe unthinking way in which they worship a dictator.\"\nMickie Marsh\nMickie Marsh\nThe endless queues of Police patiently\nwaiting for their supper in Linstead Hall\nPolice were to be\nseen everywhere during\nthe siege - even in Princes Gardens where\nthey queued for meals\nin Linstead Hall refectory.

Neil Price lost the toss, the team\nwas narrowly beaten by the President's XI and then came a close second to a well-drilled RCS outfit in a team 'boat-race'.\nCrowe and Hurst opened the bowling\nand their sheer pace soon had the\n-President's XI in trouble. Hurstcunningly\nswitched to a spin attack midway\nthrough his second over, but still no\nwickets fell. The psychological damage\nhad been done though and Dean\ncame in to take a wicket with his first\nball. Chadwick rallied with a priceless\n45 for the President's XI, as wickets\nfell steadily at the other end. Weale\nmade a spirited 21, as Dean and\nCrowe tore apart the remaining\nbatting, and the President's XI declared\nat 136 for 8.\nTea was taken and Kenrick and\nBrereton duly opened the batting.\nWithin half an hour both were out,\nhaving obviously 'left the straight one'\nto adjourn to the bar. Stantiford came\nin and dominated for an hour with an\nexcellent 46. Price and Crowe batted\nwell to take the College to within 13\nruns of the required total, with 2 overs\nremaining.\nBy now Senkiw's bowling had begun\nto make its mark and on the last ball\nof the day the College needed 6 to win\nwith one wicket standing. With Crowe\nfacing, the President's XI were understandably concerned. Every fielder\nwas positioned on the boundary.\nSenkrw raced in to bowl. Crowe lifted\nhis bat. The ball flew towards the\nwicket. Crowe followed through. The\nball removed his middle stump.\nTeam: M Kenrick; G Brereton; P Stantiford; P Slater; N Price (Capt); T Hillyer; C Roche; I Crowe; D Price; B Dean; A Hurst.\nBILLIARDS AND SNOOKER\nShock! Horror! A snooker article!\nThere has been a certain lack of\ncommunication this year between\nFELIX and the Snooker Club (partly\nour fault, partly FELIX's).I apologise\nto all our members for the lack of\ninformation about our events this\nterm.\nThe Committee for 1980/1 has been\nelected, and the joint committee\nmeeting will be on Wednesday 18th June at 1:00pm in the Union TV\nLounge.\nThe first team won the league again,\nand we actually got a cup (which is\nnow on show in the Union Office). By\nthe way, snooker lessons are still to be\nhad: just come up, and we will arrange\na time (one person who took lessons\nactually became a team member).\nDuring the summer holidays, the\nballs will be available from the Union\nOffice (Union cards are required).\nThe major change in the Club this\nyear, to my mind, was that the 'A'( team) table is now available when no\nteam members are present. Therefore,\nif the table is free do not hesitate to\nstart a frame: team members have to\nlet you finish a frame once you have\nstarted it. Finally, I would like to\ncongratulate all members of the Club\nwho received Colours (social, athletic,\nor half), and I would like to thank the\nfollowing:\n(i) The members of the committee,\nin particular Steve Jeans and Dave\nNuttall;\n(It) The thirty-odd team members,\nin particular the captains and vice-captains: Geoff Keymer, Chris Calvert, Dave Cross land, Alex\nCameron, Gareth Machin.\n(Hi) Annie in the Union Office,\nJohn Tidy and Roger Brugge for\nall their help.\n(iv) Stuart Cox, Simon Bennett,\nChris Tripp, John White, Ata Etemadi\nand Martin Proudlove; without\nthem, I would have probably gone\nstark raving mad.\n(v) The rest of the 270 members,\nfor making Billiards and Snooker\nthe most successful and most\nsociable, club in RCC, SCC, ACC or any other CC.

    "content": "REVIEWS I With the end of exams (for most of you) and eventual\nrecovery from the celebrations you may be tempted to\nview a few of the current film releases. Here's a brief look\nat some of them.\nFRIDAY THE13 TH(X) Rather appropriately, and with more than a little showmanship,\nthis horror feature is released tonight, with late shows at some\ncinemas. Also, rather appropriately, it turns out to be a bit of a disaster.\nThe plot centres on an American summer camp which has\nfallen into disuse following a series of unexplained murders. Many years later a group of youths arrive to re-open it are met with\nclich6 d for boding s of death and destruction from an equally\nclich ed village idiot. It's not much of a surprise when the kids are\ndespatched one by one in a series of gruelling and bloody ways.\nTechnically the gore is well done; the camera dwells on a young\nman's throat as a knife is thrust through from behind, and a girl's throat is slit and slowly opens in an all too realistic manner. The effects certainly look convincing, but I personally found it about\nas enjoyable as watching a dentist pull teeth. Avoid it unless you like gore.\nTHE WANDERERS (X) Set in New York in the '60s, this amusing feature concerns the\nexploits of rival gangs, primarily' The Wanderers' and' The Baldies' \u2014 a group of huge bald-headed thugs lead by a giant\ncalled Terror and his teenage girl. In an ultimately pointless tale,\ndirector Philip Kaufman manages to weave a thin plot and enjoyable period music into a light-hearted and mildly satisfying\nfilm. It's worth a few hours if you've nothing else to do.\nTHE GREAT ROCK AND ROLL SWINDLE (X) By far the most intriguing, if not well-made, film I 've seen recently\nis this condensed epic which chronicles the brief legend of the\nSex Pistols. Fascinating fro ir^ the start, it whips up a collection of\nodd characters (Ronnie Biggs, Helen of Troy and Mary Millington\nnot to mention the Pistols themselves) into a story of rock success, cent ring on the commentary of their manager, Malcolm McLaren. If the hypocrisy doesn't bite at you then the bare-faced\ncheek certainly will and you' re tempted to think that you shouldn't have ever paid to see it. At times it is riotous ly funny. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it for a good night\nout.\nFinally, I'd like to mention Get Out Your Handkerchiefs which\nis in its last week at the Curzon and The Tin Drum, both are\nworth seeing for many reasons, not least that they're very funny\nin places. Next week I shall preview Alan (Midnight Express)\nParker's new film Fame.\nMARK SMITH\nLOST a dissecting kit in a home-made blue and white\nPVC case. Lost a long while\nback. If anyone knows its\nwhereabouts please contact\nme. \u00a31 reward for its return or\nfor information leading to its\nrecovery.

Fanshaw F Love delivered a snide attack on the occupation,\nwhile Derrick Everett defended Steve M as the only one prepared to handle the\nRag Mag and The Phoenix . Frank J claimed not to object to ' orange juice swilling people'. The ICU banner was torn\nbetween the views of the Liberals and\nFeminists and Steve Hutchings was dubbed a' PM adP' for credit-watching\n(but the Editor has always taken great\ncare since!). Fox,( in full gear), was pictured' discussing the cuts' with his\ncolleague and mentor, Mary A, and FELIX became a literary battleground to\nrevive old grouses as U GM railroad ers came under fire. As Rag Week loomed\n( with the faint spectre of ' En vi ro Stotesbury Week' behind it), Phil Cole( who had plenty of credibility at this\nstage) appealed for shorter speeches at\nUG Ms(a doomed idea wrecked by its\nbespectacled U GM proposer). Alan Burton defended his democratic quorum-challenging rights as the PG Dinner failed\nowing to lack of appetite. Jan C and Short-Life Housing hit FELIX while if you\nended Rag Week\" lonely, bored and tired\" you must have been on the Fox/ SO'B idiosyncratic Bank Job1 Boat\nRaces in the Be it Quad( and onion munches on the front page) together with\nthe Beer Festival proved the new ICU President certainly wasn'ta pretty face,\nwhile Leo(N OB) of RCS appeared covered in muck( obviously not moving\nfast enough).\nKnife Grinders' Weekly\n\" Anna and Marge\" offered 'counselling\nsessions' on the constant need to table\npro abortion motions at UG Ms, while Frankie J and the lads found their public\nimages tarnished by a hostile Cambridge\nUniversity Challenge team. RCS' s mascot\nJez at last re payed Jon Hall's years of\nsleeping in a suit, by moving of her own\naccord and the Ents films appeared in\nrandom order on the centre pages. Roger\nhoped his Enviro-week 'will excite you\nsufficiently' and Fox's XV beat Townsend's men by 24 to 6.\nColin Palmer\nDavid Owen, one of the guest speakers during\nEnvironmental Week.\nMeanwhile the Snooker Club scribe( Dai Bach) shocked millions with his tales\nof 'Sanshit's Nocturnal Emissions' and far\nless savoury comments. The Editor subsequently printed a heavily censored\ncomplaint from Dai about shortening his\narticles. Ladies' Rugby became established\nas No1 Space Filler, as the E AO instructed the Hon Sec to 'pull his socks\nup'.\nSpace Invasion\nMark Smith previewed Star Trek The\nMP, Apocalypse Now, Life Of Brian and\nThe Black Hole on a single page \u2014 the\n30th Anniversary Issue came complete\nwith a realistic-looking editorial while Paul\nWilliams made FELIX history by having\nDrake's Seven's Supreme Galactic Rear\nFlight Superintendent Bratt (Ms) appear\n'unclothed'! Suddently, it's Christmas and\nFox becomes painfully jolly, overburdened\nby ' HoH oHo' Yuletide cynicism. Malcolm vows to 'curl up and drink New ky Brown all day' The catalytic young fresher s, like\nthe worthy' Anne and Robin' of Mr Newland (remember Richard, the tid d ly wink child molester?) say farewell to\noverseas cuts victims, pondering the\n' emotional turmoil and watersheds in\npeople's lives' \u2014 but no matter, the term\nends with a tear jerking editorial. \" And so\nthis is Xmas \u2014 and what have we done?\"\nBen Bourdillon\nThe Prime Minister donated \u00a35 to IC Rag in\nDecember.\nThe editor's digital watch says 6:10am. Soon the sun will be rising heralding the\nstart of another last minute Thursday panic session in the FELIX office.\nTERM THE SECOND Spring sprang and Dave Derby won the\nMirror Dingy World Champs in Perth,\nAustralia and Paul Williams (Editor of the\nDrake's Seven Fan Magazine and admirer\nof antique typewriters) won a Daily\nExpress prize. Harvey Nadin forsook IC\nRadio for the degree he was later to save\nso spectacularly. Brendon left the Union Bar, and Colin Palmer resigned( from\nP WP) in the week that Ladies' Rugby hit\nCBS News, Richard Earl recieved0% response from Aero PG s to his questionnaire on PG Apathy and Chris Webb gate crashed NUS Conference posing (?)\nas a Tory. Colin P reviewed the adventures of\nZoe, the well known photographic Debbie\nHarry\nSteve Groves\nexperiment with a mouth tucked neatly\nup near the hairline. Debbie Harry made\nthe front page (and hasn't looked back\nsince) and Mickie Marsh claimed 'she\nalmost managed to screw herself (into\nthe floor). As The Phoenix emerged from\nEric' sashes( followed by Ve g soc, Microcomputer Club and an on Barry Austin PATA), hostilities broke out between Broadsheet and FELIX( photo\nby CP).

    "content": "COLLEGE SECURITY A note by the Union Welfare Officer and ICWA\nOn9 th June from 11:00pm to 01:00pm Mer che Clark and Pete Stevens toured\nthe College to see how many ways into\nbuildings, especially Halls, were unlocked,\nopen, or accessible. The standard of\nlighting on walkways and roads was also\nchecked.\nThe results were appalling. Neither surveyor was too familiar with the residences and yet numerous entrances\nwere found. These ranged from doors wedged open through locked doors with\nno glass in a window pane, to windows\nopen in every dark corner and by fire\nexits. The deployment of the security guards was badly organised.\nJust two and a half weeks after a girl\nwas raped the situation could easily happen again. Not even the barest temporary actions seems to have been\ntaken. All four lifts in Southside still go to\nthe basement all night \u2014 this could have\nbeen changed immediately after the incident.\nNote On Lights\nEven in areas where there are sufficient\nnumber of lights, some locations had fifty\npercent quota of broken bulbs. The type of lighting was inadequate. The recessed tubes of the walkway only give\nabout thirty per cent efficiency due to the\nshadow of the housing. All lights were\nsoft in colour and gave a diffuse, shadowy\nlight. It is possible to stand next to the\nlights behind 170 Queen's Gate and not\nbe seen due to the poor spread of light.\nWe felt that a fewer number of standard\nyellow sodium lamps mounted in the conventional street light form would be\nfar more effective.\nNote On Security\nWe could not understand why the Southside main entrance had two guards\nand a messenger on duty \u2014 all minding\ntheir own business \u2014' while the Be it guard is expected to occupy the archway\nand patrol the building. Could not o he of\nthe Southside team patrol all the buildings\nand still leave a guard at each door?\nThe detailed results of the survey have\nnot been published in FELIX for obvious\nreasons. Copies have been sent to the\nRector and Captain J Lindley of Estates.\nIt is Captain Lindley's responsibility to\nsupervise security. In the wake of recent\nevents it would seem that Captain Lindley\nhas not carried out his duties to the satisfaction of the Union. Chris Fox had a meeting with the Rector on Wednesday to discuss the report.\nMcrche Clark Pete Stevens\nPresident ICWA Welfare Officer\nHoliday Help Grand Sale\nAs you look forward to your long summer\nbreak please think about those less fortunate, in particular Valerie Sparks, her husband Bob and four-year-old-son,\nwho have been offered\" a holiday in Exmouth but cannot just board a coach\nor train.\nWhy?\nValerie was a normal happy schoolgirl\nand keen swimmer until the age of\ntwenty-one when she contacted mul it ple sclerosis. Now at only twenty-three she is\ntotally disabled and blinded by the crippling disease. Her husband has had to\ngive up his job to look after the family;\nand living off Social Security leaves little\nto pay for the high cost of the required\ndouble ambulance journey to and from\nExmouth.
