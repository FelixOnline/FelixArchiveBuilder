Schumann, Symphony No. 4.\nThis was a very ambitious concert by the\nSymphony Orchestra, with two symphonies and\ni wo ot her pieces on t he programme. Haydn' s104t hSv m phony is in i act the last of his twelve\nsymphonies written lor a series oi concerts in\nLondon and therefore has no more right to its\nnickname than those more usually known as 'The\nClock\" or 'The Surprise\". It received a com pet ant performance In the orchestra, who managed to\nco nye y both the beauty of the slow introduction\nand of the second movement, and the excitement\nand vivacity ol the last two movements,\nThe soloist in the Liszt E flat concerto was\nValerie Ash worth, presently in her fourth year at\nthe RCM. The demands ol this piece on the\nstrength and stamina of the soloist are\nconsiderable, but despite this. Miss Ashworth gave -a faultless and most enjoyable performance. The orchestra had clearly worked hard at this item, and\none could easily forget that this was amateur\nmusic-making; their spirited playing was as good as\nam of the many professional orchestras this\nreviewer had heard play in this concerto.\nThe first item in the second half of the concert\nwas the Pavane by Gabriel Fame, a short work\nwith one of those flowing themes which run back\ninto themselves like a perpetual motion machine.\nThis was followed by Schumann's4 th symphony, a piece which is shorter, lighter and more\ncontrapuntal than many other symphonies of\ncomparable vintage. This involved a considerable\nsolo part for violin, which was admirably executed\nby David Bogle. The orchestra played well\nthroughout, with crisp confident entries into the\ncanonical coda at the end, tor example.\nOne mall grumble: could we have legible\nprogramme-, lor the next concert, please.J Derrick Everett\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE CHOIR, Conductor, E Brown.\n18th May, in the Great Hall.\nJ.S. Bach, Cantata No. 21.\nE.J. Moeran, Nocturne.\nJ. Berger, Brazilian Psalm.\nG. Bizet, Te Deum.\nTo say that Johann Sebastian Bach\nwas one of the 'greatest' composers of\nWestern music is to say nothing new.\nBut for many years after the composers\ndeath, his music was neglected because\nit was thought to be stuffy and\nacademic. Eventually it was revived, by\nMendelssohn in Germany, by Wesley in\nthis country and by Shostakovich in the\nSoviet Union. Music can only be fully\nappreciated by the ear and not by the\neye; once the scores are performed, the\npublic can begin to form opinions.\nToday most people are aware of Bach's music, and know that it appeals to more than\nthe intellect ; and could p.o b ably whistle\n'Sheep may safely gra*. jr 'Jesu, joy of\nMan's desiring', at t lv.r op of a hat. Both of\nthese well known \u2022 <'s come from Bach's numerous cantata.'., and one such was the\nopening work in last Friday's Choir concert.\nThis was No. 21 of the Church cont at as,' My heart was greatly troubled', in which the Soul\ngoes from despair to joy via a central duet in\nwhich the Soul (soprano) is con for ted by\nChrist (bass).\nfC Choir seemed to be greatly troubled by\nthe first two choruses, but picked up\nconfidence towards the end of the cantata.\nThe orchestral accompaniment includes a rather demanding 'cello part, especially in\nthe second of the tenor arias. Unfortunately\nthe cellist. Peter Beavan, and harpsichordist,\nChristopher Shaw, did not quite agree on the\ntempo of this passage. The three vocal so lists gave an enjoyable rendering of their\nrespectively allotted notes. All three were to\nreappear later in the programme.\nAfter the interval, the Choir continued\nwith two twentieth century pieces. The first\nof these was a Nocturne by EJ Moeran, a piece very similar in style and atmosphere to\n'Sea Drift' by Delius, but on a much smaller\nscale. The musical form of the nocturne was\nof course set by another composer of Irish\nextraction, the pianist John Field.E.J.' s piece\nis about evening rather than night, since the\ntext is an 'address to the sunset'. As befits\nnocturnal music, the voices are accompanied\nmostly by muted strings, with sparing use of\nthe wind instruments. The atmosphere of a peaceful summer evening was captured\nrather well by the Choir and the baritone\nsoloist, Clive Harre. It is a piece which I shall\nlook forward to hearing again one day:\nunfortunately, Moeran's music, like that of\nmany British composers active immediately\nbefore the last war, is rather neglected in\nconcerts today.\nThe second and more adventurous of the\n'modern' pieces was an addition to the\nadvertised programme. This was the\n'Brazilian Psalm' by Jean Berger, for\nunaccompanied choir. This sounded quite\ndifficult, but the Choir seemed to enjoy\nsinging it and handled the dynamics very\nwell. Unfortunately the words, a supplemented version of one of the psalms,\nwere not always clear.\nThe last work to be performed was Bizet's 'Te Deum', with Diane Mansfield and Jeffrey\nCresswell as soloists. As the principal text of\nrejoicing and praise in the liturgy of the\nmajor Christian Churches, the Te Deum has\nbeen set to music by a great many composers,\nand Bizet's setting is a particularly exuberant\none. The heavy vamping accompaniment in\nthe opening and final passages is perhaps a little uninspired, but the tunes are lively and\nso was this performance. Diane Mansfield\nsung beautifully in the soprano solo, 'Te\nergo'. Professor Brown took the piece at a fairly brisk pace which left the listener with\nan impression of energetic rejoicing, and the\nChoir, despite being fewer in numbers than\nusual, came across clearly even in the loudest\norchestral passages.\nDerrick Everett\nIC COMMUNITY ACTION GROUP Presents a FREE\nBARREL\nI \u2014 ^\nor the year that makes the best showing in the Blood Do ning^^ IS 0,\nMay2930 "

While we have a2 party monopoly the voice of minority groups and indeed the voice ol the whole population is contorted by the constraint of the ' choice' oi the lesser ol2 evils, each party blackmailing us into accepting their global package of policies by\nthreatening us with the opposing package. Particular issues and the\ntight sol individuals are stamped under the dogmas of the opposing sides. In a survey during the last\nelection over65% of the population wanted a hung parliament. So where is\ndemocracy here when the Conservative Party with less than hall the votes, has a parliamentary majority capable of sustaining policies no matter how extreme. Although I voted Labour at the general election in an effort to maintain the\nsemblance of democracy ensuing a hung parliament I now believe the only way to stop this\nquin quan ni al dictatorship is to\nvote Liberal and fight seriously\nfor proportional representation already accepted in Northern Ireland.

Bambridge,\nMaths 1\nDear Sir, With reference to the\n' News in Brief article in FELIX last week, which covered the S CC meeting of 10th May, I would like to clarify a few points. The application by PATA for\nacceptance on to S CC was not\nrejected because its aims were in part covered by the Welfare Service and I CW A. It is not a requirement for acceptance of a society that its aims must not\noverlap with those of an existing society. If this were so then many of the religious and political societies would be unacceptable. The reasons quoted for rejection of the society are the\narguments of the opponents of the societies acceptance, and not a decision of the committee. In my opinion a number of people voted on i dio logi ral grounds rather than on the constitutional merits of the proposed society.\nCertain amendments to the\nconstitution were accepted at the\nmeeting, but understandably not\nthose which altered the aims of the society beyond recognition. An altered constitution will be\nsubmitted to the next S CC meeting for approval. I hope that this letter will correct any erroneous impressions your readers may have formed. Yours sincerely, J. P.Ron an Chem II\nDear Sir.I see from your article on bar prices last week that\nProfessor E il on is as determined to\nextract the greatest amount of money out of students in the bars\nas he is in the refectories.\nHe stated that college policy is\nI hat bars should be 'competitive\nail h loud pubs.' This rather vague statement could mean that as long as prices are only slightly lower or even lire same as those in South Kensington pubs then they are\ncompetitive. As1 am sure Andy Middleton s pub price survey will confirm, this is the current state of all airs. allowing, as Prof. E il on admits, profits in be 'maximise d'.1 have therefore reason to\nbelieve that, unless there is huge ili ellie iei Kv. these profits must be\nenormous since I he Real Ale Society, which admittedly does\nno l have I lie wages and overheads of i he College bars, can even so\nsell beer ;ii prices comparable with pubs in South Kensington, which is a'ri pol f place, there by taking advantage of local conditions at the cx pence of the\nstudent. But then again, profits\nmust be maximise d Yours faithfully. Martin Sladdin,\nBotany 3\nDear Sir, Mer che Clark tries to\nhide the truth the same way as the NAC speaker did at the I CW A meeting. NAC passed a resolution at the 78 Conference for the\nrepeal of the Infant life Preservation Act. If this Act was repealed it would not be an offence to ' abort' a child the day before its birth and leave it to die.\nEnough said. B PAS doctors can make \u00a35,000\nper year for the equivalent of one day's work a week( from B PAS annual reports). No profiteering? A thorough investigation into the after effects of B PAS abortions has never been done. The worst after effects of abortion do not\nshow until many years later( eg\neffects on subsequent children). Imposing views? Who imposed their views on the 1 1/2 million innocents who have died since the\npassing of the1967 Abortion Act? I respect Mer che Clark for\narguing rationally. Puerile bitching is not worthy of reply. fam not PAT A's founder. Sean Kelly and myself are cof o under s. Legal advice is in no doubt the fC Unions constitution was contravened at the meeting, but if what M, Brain said is ture and S CC recognition will make no difference except getting a grant, then the matter is not\nworth per suing as I don't mind financing PATA out of my own pocket and from members' donations. We shall run the\nsociety as we see fit, not as anti lifers see fit. Ihop eM Brain will honour his word for our room bookings, fresher s' fair stall,\npublicity etc.\nBarry Austin\nActing Chairman PATA Dear Sir, In FELIX issue 5 1 8\nMer che Clarke dwelt at length on Womens' rights, and also informed us that the National Abortion Campaign does not\nimpose its beliefs upon others. I would like to reply to these points, but would li rst like to answer her\nquestion on the quality of life.\nIs a good life one in which we have all those material things which make life comfortable? Then it is pure selfishness to deny life to a child whose birth would necessitate spending less on oneself. A good life must therefore\nbe more socially responsible, an attitude which requires consideration of the rights of others including those of a child yet to be born. co nld. on Page 3\n\n"

I was fascinated\nfrom the beginning by the idea of one of\nEurope' s most promising directors\ncombining once more with the talent of the\noften temp re mental actor Klaus Kinski. On\nviewing the result I was thrown back to my\nchildhood - old fears and fantasies re-emerged.\nThe story sticks closely to the ideas of the\noriginal novel. The evil Count is portrayed as\na sad, infinitely lonely creature who seems to\nbe fighting for release. Truth and faith are\nseen to be ignored in favour of scientific\nprinciple, but in the end they prevail. The\nproduct of fear and fantasy is a strange\nfascination for this almost too real being. His\nevery appearance drew my undivided\nattention.\nJohanatan Harker is sent to Transylvannia\nto sell a house in his picturesque home town\nto Count Dracula. He encounters a fanged,\nwhite faced creature with cauliflower ears\nwho holds him force ably in his cas j le.On seeing a picture of Lucy, Johnathan's wife he\nmutters the laughable line, 'Oh what a lovely\nneck!' He then sets sail for Delft (such a beautiful location) with Lucy's jugular in\nmind. The ensuing tale is familiar but filmed\nin such a way as to be new and refreshing.\nThe scenes alternate between the silence\nof darkness and the silence of the plague\nstricken town, each being a collection of\nserene, ghostly images crammed with soft,\nmelancholy colours. The result is beautiful\nand horrific, but I can't explain why. In fact\nmuch of the film defies description - is it a tribute to the effective use of visual imagery in\nsilent films or a demonstration of clever\ncamera work? Either way it is very enjoyable,\neven with subtitles. Also of great note are the\nperformances of Kinski (as Dracula) and\nIsabelle Adjani as Lucy. They blend in the\nfinal scene to produce a conflict of sexual\ndesire and physical repulsion. I applaud the\nabsence of blood dripping from the\nvampire's fangs at every opportunity.\nPase 11\nIFILM\nI would recommend this film to anybody\nwho likes to dwell for more than an hour or so\non a story. For a less demanding night out\nwait for the other dracula reworks currently in\nthe pipeline - most of which will inevitably use\na tall, handsome lover for the Count role. Well\nyou can keep them as far as I'm concerned. -Klaus Kinski has proved he is worth a dozen\nChristopher Lees. I also think that buckets of\nblood should be saved for incoming R CSU execs!\nP.S.

A protracted series of telephone calls eventually resulting in\n10 men plus Mel Kinkie taking the field.\nSalter won the toss and was conned into electing to bat by the bevy of\nhockey players whose sole aim was to heckle at the Southgate vs\nHounslow hockey match. Such was Middleton's eagerness to leave the\ncricket match that he tried the old trick of 'leaving the straight one', early\non. He was later described as the 'worst spectator at the hockey match.'.\nClothier then demonstrated the futility of the cross batted swipe and\nsoon returned to the bar.\nNext to depart for the hockey\nwas Reilly, who after hacking a stylish 9 gave the 'keeper some\ncatching practice. During all this\nHewkin has been playing shots\nwhich nobody knew he possessed, but when he realised\nthat he could not afford a jug for\nhis fifty, he threw away his wicket\nhaving scored 32. Fenton soon fell\nLB W and this brought the\nexperienced Acford to the wicket\nto join his captain. Salter looked\nhopelessly out of form and fell\nvictim to a spectacular slip catch\nafter scoring a streaky 14. The\nsight of Acford at the wicket\nseemed to affect the co ordination of the fielders who\ndropped him several times and\ntwice gave him 4 overthrows.\nUnfortunately Gattley fell victim\nto some appalling umpiring (no\nnames,Clothier) and Roche, Elkin\nand Jones could offer little\nsupport and Acford was last out\nfor a very lucky 37.\nThe total of 112 seemed unlikely\nto be enough on a good wicket,\nbut the capture of 2 wickets by\nFenton and a fine run-out by\nReilly sent Charing Cross into tea\nwith 5 for 3 on the board. A quick\nbreakthrough after tea was\nessential, and Acford provided\nthis. An over later Hewkin and\nRoche made a bizzar e sight as\nthey collided whilst both trying to\ntake a simple chance. The\nrep rei ved batsman took new life\nand proceeded to edge and slash\nhis way to a decisive 59 n,o., it was\nperhaps apt that he was named\nChopin. Two untidy overs from\nMiddleton and some scrappy\nfielding paved the way for a Charing Cross victory, despite\nlate wickets from Reilly and\nGattley. Fenton bowled well to\ntake 2-24 in 10 overs.\nEventually Charing Cross won\nby four wickets. The defeat was\ndoubly disappointing since there\nwas always a feeling that IC were\nthe better team and we were\nunable to avenge the UL U cup\ndefeat of the 1st XI earlier in the\nweek.\n1 FOOTBALL IC IV Stride On\nImperial IV 2 v1 Chelsea II\nImperial College IV extended\ntheir unbeaten run with a hard\nfought victory over a strong\nChelsea team at Harlington. Fresh\nfrom a long Easter vacation\nImperial, very much the team in\nform, had been looking forward to\nthis match for some time.\nIt turned out to be a typical\nHarlington game with the wind\nhaving as much influence on the\ngame as either of the two teams.\nWith the wind behind them in the\nfirst half, Imperial had most of the\npossession which probably accounts for them only being one\ngoal up at half time. A cheeky\nback heel by James Rowley\nseperated the teams after 30\nminutes, shortly after Millar and\nMarten had both gone close.\nThe second half saw a spirited\nrecovery by Chelsea and inevitably after 20 minutes of\nconstant pressure the IC defence\ncracked and it was 1-1 with\neverything to play for. This goal\nproved to be Chelsea's fatal\nmistake because, although Cooke\nand Millar were injured by this\nstage, IC began to reassert\nthemselves. With excellent goal keeping from Veats and\nsound defensive work from Phil\n'You never mention me in the\nreports' Lakin and Barry Hatton,\nIC fought their way back into\ncontention. The vital goal arrived\ncourtesy of James Rowley whose\nindividual effort came with just\nfive minutes to go.\nIC IV now have one match left\nwhich they are confident of\nwinning as in the bar afterwards it\nwas discovered that Chelsea were\ntop of the league.\nTeam: Veats, Morris, Caffyn,\nHatton, Lakin (Captj, Marten,\nCook, Milar, Matthews, Rowley,\nO 'Kelly. Reporter: Glen Millar.\nIC 2nd XI 127 All out\nUC 2nd XI 110 for 4\nMatch Drawn\nIC won the toss and were\nsoon 20 for 3. At this point\nMaguire went out to join\nopener Sims and tried to lose\nhis wicket also. His vain\nattempts at this ceased when\nhe had made 8 and the\npartnership moved the score\nmore comfortably to 68. At\nthis point the thought of\nSalter's umpiring and 3rd rate humour forced Maguire\nto un subtly run himself out\nby 5 yards. 2 more wickets\nfollowed quickly to bring\nChadband, an aggressive\nstroke maker, out to join\nPrice. Chad band made 5 out\nof a partnership of 28.\nAlter such dour batting carving\ncavalier Care swore he would cut\nloose but in fact made 7 out ofthe\nnext partnership of 25.\nIC were all out for 127, the\nrespectability of the score being\ndue to the Sims-Maguire stand\nand an aggressive 43 from Price.\nUC lost 3 wickets quickly, for\n27. and never really tried for\nanything but the draw, despite\nbeing given easy runs when Care\nand Price, who bowl slow seam-up half-volleys were brought into\nthe attack.\nUC being not tempted, Imperial closed up the game by\nbringing back the reliable Wyatt,\nwho took all 4 wickets, and\nChad band who was unlucky to be\nplayed at and missed 3 or 4 times\nin every over he bowled.\nPete Turner returned to fC2 nds after a2 year lay off in\nindustry, and reminded us that he\nis better at running out his own\nside than he is at running out the\nopposition.\nSaturday sees Salter take over\ncaptaincy for one game, from\nbrilliant astute tactician Furnish,\nwhich could explain the exit of\nhalf the side to the first Xf and the\nun availability ofthe other half.\nIC 3rd XI (Minus one)\nRSM Only XI (Minus one)\nLast Wednesay, two revision-ravaged teams of 'cricketers'\ntravelled to Harlington for their annual friendly. IC were\ncaptained by Acford, who was obviously still recovering from the rig ours of his tour to Holland with the cross-country club,\nmere months earlier.\nMines, having allowed IC to field, made a shaky start, losing their\nfirst wicket for only 104 runs (Button, 32), but Sangster hung on gamely\nto make 82. Mines then recovered, next eight wickets putting on fifty-nine runs. This was partly due to a series of three balls from\nCoatesworth, which all took wickets (this cap -trick or something was\npayed for with a jug of shandy after the match!). He finally finished\nwith 5 wickets lor 6 runs.\nWith Mines 163 all out,\nHew kin and Acford survived a ferocious over before tea, but on\ntheir return, they had a slight\nmisunderstanding, resulting in\nHew kin being run out for three.\nAcford then made up for being\ntotally at fault by thrashing the\nRS M bowling until, with his score\non zero, he was confused by a straight long-hop on middle\nstump.\nThe situation (11 for 2) was\nslightly relieved by a good 28 from\nMiddleton, who fell to a rising\nfinger from the umpire. The later\nresistance consisted mainly of a career best 16 from Roche\n(previous best 3) and a lighting\n14 from Riley who. recruited from\nthe earlier hockey match, seemed\na little perplexed by his stick not\nhaving a kink in it.\nThe match ended with a dubious plumb LB W decision in\nfavour of Bark Mutton, who\nfinished with 4 wickets.\nThe teams then enjoyed a ninety minute wait lor the coach\nbefore invading the Union. Teams - IC: Acford, Heukin.\nMiddle/on, Fenton, Coatesworlh,\nHolder, Makers, Roche. Heath, Riley.\nRSM: Button, Sangster, Crombie,\nCocker, Trevarlhen. Tucker,\nMontague, Booth, Sleep.

After thanking the landlord for\nhis fillet steak he sat in his car and drove off -up the right hand side of the road into an\narticulated lorry.\nTaunton's deputy police commander said:\n'There was no need for the breath aly ser, because it was a genuine mistake and no-one\nwas hurt. After a good meal he probably\nthought he was still in France'.\nRussians fix the drinks\nThe American Embassy is advising\ndiplomats to accept drinks from Russians\nonly if they see them being poured out and\ntheir hosts drink with them.\nThe warning follows investigations after an\nAmerican and an Australian diplomat were\ntaken ill on a visit to the Ukraine.

It has been ex sti mated that it will\ncost around \u00a35,000 to repair the damage.\n6-tongue pocket computer\nA pocket machine that could replace the\nlanguage phrase-book and the telephone\naddress book has been launched in Britain.\nIt costs \u00a3148 plus VAT, and is the world's first hand-held computer.

'\nLooking for a job, girls?\nKnife thrower Carlos Carlezra is about to\ninterview applicants for the job of 'human\ntarget' - he says the successful applicant\nmust be attractive, between 17 and 22, and\nhappy to stand against a board whilst knives,\nspears and axes are thrown at her.\nLeyland in Honda deal\nBritish Leyland is to spend around \u00a340 million\non building a new car which will be designed\nby Honda, and sold under the Triumph\nbadge.\nHonda will supply the gearbox and engine,\nand Leyland will produce the body.

At present there are\nknown to be more Norwegian rats than\npeople in the city. Last year, there were at\nleast eight million, and by this summer there\ncould be eleven million. A single female can\nproduce 30,000 offspring per year, around\n15,000 of which can be expected to survive.\nA600 strong task force has been employed\nto fight the rats, and Health Authorities fear\nthe recurrence of the Black Death plague,\nwhich is spread by rats. The rats are thriving\non waste dumped in the city - 10% of food\npurchased by New Yorkers is thrown out\nevery day.\nWales beat Scotland 3-0\nThree goals from John Toshack gave\nWales their first win over Scotland in 15 years.\nThe home international football match was a fast moving entertaining spectacle.

Oil\nexports would have to be increased by the\namount the IEA decided was the average fall\nin normal supplies before any more could be\nused in Britain. This would almost certainly\nmean the introduction of mandatory conservation measures by the Government to\nreduce demand.\nTuesday 22nd UDI Settlement\nThe Conservative Government is set to\nbring Rhodesia back to legality after 14 years\nof unilaterally-declared independence. Mrs\nThatcher and her colleagues have accepted\nthe view of a team of Conservative observers\nthat the recent elections in Rhodesia were\nrelatively fair and free.\nThe acceptance of the elections could\nfulfil the last of the six principles which\nsuccessive British Governments have\ninsisted on being met if any Salisbury regime\nis to be acceptable.\n\n"

With Barry War ing in the\nChair. Sharon Spiers (Abortion\nLaw Rei brm Association opened\nthe debate by proposing the\nmotion 'This house believes that\nfree abortion should be available\non request'. The main theme of\nher speech was that the choice was\nnot between abortion or no\nabortion , but between legal\nabortion or illegal abortion.\nSharon pointed out that since the\nlast abortion act (1967) the\nnumbers ol deaths of the mother,\ndue, directly or indirectly, to\nabortion had fallen drastically\nand that over one million women\nhad had an abortion since the act.\nPhyllis Bowman (Society for\nthe Protection of unborn children) replied with an equally\nstirring speech in which she\npursued the theme that human\nlife begins al conception and that\nthere is no difference between\nabortion and infanticide. She also\ndisagreed with most of Sharon's statistical back-ups even when\nthey apparently came from the\nsame source (the House of\nCommons).\nApparently it is now tradition\nlor Spiers and Bowman to do\nbattle together at student union\ndebates and as such this proved\nit sell to be one of our most exciting\nto dale.\nAlter a question and answer\nsession a vote was taken and the\nmotion was defeated by a margin\nol only one vote.\nCharlotte Matts\nPublicity Officer\nFORMAL CONCERT& c Friday, May 2 5\n7.0 pm Weber - Oieron Overture\nKakfitnafunoff - Ptono\n{outer to M*1Urals' s Satan parti&J \u2022Pe&JJlATaR is FuyiMGdHtoOtM OUKftSfAce tM\u00a3\u00a3&. ir xS rr j&oca cNt( fT J Q N'T OmggSTftKP- WHY ARE\" ft ll THE PLANETS SQUARE f)C QOOPHE35 KHOWS \u2022 HcO) TtfiHT, 1'U.

    "content": "Page 14\nCONSERVATIVE SOCIETY - European Elections\nIn the forthcoming election 1 would appreciate it greatly if\nyou all voted Conservative ... No this is not a pre-General\nElection article which was somehow rediscovered after lying\nfor weeks amongst the piles of rubbish on the floor of the\nEEL IX office; Iam referring to the forgotten (at least in\nBritain) elections for the European Assembly.\nConsoc scored a first in college by being the first political society to\ninvite a candidate namely Sir David Nicolson who is standing for one of\nthe 81 giant British constituencies London Central, which contains 10\nWestminster parliamentary seats. This election is a unique occurrence\nsince it is the World's first simultaneous international elections and will\nresult in Europe's first democratically elected parliament.\nSpeaking on Tuesday. May8 th to a vast audience of at least 10\npeople Sir David proceeded to explain why Europe and in particular,\nBritain needs a strong European Economic Community run by a democratically elected European Parliament.\nMembership of the EEC does becomes a strong and coherent\nnot mean a free meal ticket, but it\ndoes present opportunities for\nBritain to take advantage oi.\nAlthough it is clear there is a requirement to reform the\nCommon Agricultural Policy, its\ninherent advantages namely the\nprospects of Community self-sufficiency in food at a time ol\nincreasing World populations,\nmust not be overlooked. The\nreason for food sur plusses, which\nhave given rise to the notorious\nmountains and lakes has been the\ngreatly increased production ol\nfood by the Community over the\nlast decade or so.\nIt is essential that Europe\ndefence bloc not only able to\nsupplement the defence umbrella\nprovided by the USA, but\neventually to possess its own\ndefence network and th'. dispensing with reliability o \u2022 lie\nUS defences which would '..tv e to\nprovide protection ir. \u2022 finitely,\nwhich is a dangerous position to\nbe in. Nuclear deterrents only\nwork if there is Mutually Assured\nDestruction, MAD, which because there is now no strict\nparity between USA and USSR is\nno longer true. Until both sides\nlearn how to participate in\nbilateral disarmament s there is an\nurgent need lor the West, which\nincludes Europe, a party which\nmatches both 'Superpowers' in\nwealth and populations, to\nmaintain the balance of weapons.\nFor increased wealth, Britain\nmust increase her share of the\nexport market; a1% increase\nrepresents 400,000 new jobs. By\nfar the greatest prospects of\nachieving this lie in the\nexploitation of the vast market\nfurnished by the EEC Europe also\nprovides the opportunity for\nLondon, capital of Britain, to\nbecome the chief economic\ncapital of the Community since\nBritain has large assets such as the\nCommunity' s largest coal reserves, North Sea oil and\nexpertise in many fields. Britain\ncan also learn from her\nCommunity partners in her\nweaker areas such as labour law,\nlor example.\nA more specific area where\nCommunity funds could be\nutilised is the channel tunnel\nwhich if in the form of a road\nand double rail tunnel could\nrelieve greatly the congestion at\nHeathrow. Since neither Britain\nnor FYance are exactly eager to\nloot the bill alone, money\nsupplied by the rest of the\nCommunity could be used to\nfinance this and other major\nprojects affecting specific areas\nwithin the EEC. So on Thursday, June7 th you\nhave the opportunity to vote and\nyou have the choice between\nsending European ministers\nwhich will try to get a 'lair deaf\nfor Britain - whatever that means\nand those which will endeavour to\npositively help Europe to the\nbenefit of Britain and the\nCommunity as a whole. Thus it is\nessential that you vote for the\nparty which took Britain into\nEurope, which is the Conservative Party.\nPeople are required for helping\nto leaflet the London Central\nconstituency - which is a marginal. The College halls of\nresidence may require hand\nleafleting if it is decided that the\nforces which caused the\nd is appearence of the General\nElection leaflets are still present.\nSo if you want to help, then\ncontact our chairman, Stephen\nPoley, CCD3 or any other\nmember of Consoc you think may\nbe able to give you rel event information.\nOh by the way I have great\npleasure in announcing the\nSchlomo Godsi has filled the\nvacant place of Publicity Officer.\n:TENNIS\nFirsts Slaughter\nKings Team\nIC 1st VI v Kings 1st VI\nThe now very cosmopolitan tennis team set out in a Marina and a transit van to Hartington to battle against a reputedly strong Kings side.\nWith a supporters'squad of 8, the team was very anxious to keep the\nunbeaten record ahci eve d so far this season. Upon arr ving at Harlington\nwe were confronted with a rou dy group with names such as ll le someone, Jimmy-boy and BB, the latter being a tall Scandanavian. We\nnaturally complained about this unlikely squad but were shown rather\ndubious union cards, these being bits of paper with their names\ns cribbed on in green crayon and Kings College, Lodnon written above.\nNot particularly daunted, but far the club house eating our tea, we\nfrom undaunted, the Imperial\nside set about Kings like lions, sea\nlions. The inevitable soon looked\ninevitable with Imperial losing a service game with four double\nfaults; obviously nerves were\nplaying a large part in the match.\nLuckily good serving from our\nopponents was not ici bly absent\nand we stormed to a30 lead after\nthe first round. This was met with\ntotal silence from the Kings side\nas they obviously resolved\nthemselves to a hard fight as the\nmatch progressed.\nIt was only after the second\nround when we found ourselves in\nan unbeatable position that we\nrealised our mistake. As we sat in\nrealised what had happened.\nKings had not even sent a team,\nthe match was cancelled and we\nhad not been playing against\nanyone at all.\nImagine our horror with all this\ntea and orange juice going to\nwaste. Very luckily the generous\nsupporters came to our rescue\nand made short work of the food\nand especially the orange juice.'\nThirsty work being a supporter:\nstrange how they didn't realise\nKings weren't here either.\nFinal Result\nIC 6 Kings 0\nMatch stopped because Kings\ndidn't turn up.\nIC 1st VI v Bush Hill 1st VI\nUnder 21 Middlesex knock-out\nImperial College entered this competition for the first time this year\nand were hoping to do well. We were in good spirits as we set off on a sunny Friday evening and felt quietly confident.\nThe four team members left in Tony's Marina towards North London.\nLuckily Tony knew the area and we zoomed up and down the back\nstreets like Starsky and Hutch. We finally got there after being given\nthree different sets of directions. Bush Hill Park LT C is situated in the\nMiddle class commuter belt of North London where no-one knows\nwhere anywhere is!\nUpon arriving we were whisked\noff to the local park to play on\nsome very slow courts which\nsuited some of us, namely the less\ntalented. We were greeted by a smiling toothless fellow who told\nme about his trip to the ladies on a cleaning errand only to be\nslapped round the face by a self-conscious old woman.\nWell now to the match. Our\nopponents were on the young\nside with little match experience.\nAfter a long wait for their fourth\nmember, who had missed his bus,\nthe match began. The 1st round\nwas soon over with a loss of only 5\ngames by the IC team. The second\nround progressed much the same\nway for Tony and Dave losing\nonly 2 games before taking the\nmatch and hence winning the\nwhole round. In the other match\nBarry and I were rather more\ngenerous. After losing the first\ngame we took the set 6-1. In the\nsecond set some atrocious play\nby both of us enabled the Bush\nHill pair to win the set 7-5. One set\nall, very close, both sides going\nfor the win. Unfortunately for\nthem we were going for it a bit\nharder, winning the final set 6-0\nwith the loss of only 6 points.\nWe returned to the club house\nfor fried eggs, sausages, beans\netc. and several pints of Abbot. We\nalso discovered two fruit machines with jack pots of \u00a350\nand \u00a3100. I decided not to win it\nbecause I thought we might\nbecome a bit unpopular.\nFinal Result\nIC 4 Bush Hill 0\nTony Tsoukas 6-2, 6-0, 1st pair\nDave Cornwall 6-2, 6-0 2nd pair\nBarry Witts 6-1, 5-7, 6-0 1st pair\nSimon Middelboe 6-2, 6-1 2nd pair\nSimon Middelboe\n\n"

He was from Bethany, the village\nof Mary and her sister Martha. So the sisters sent word to Jesus, 'Lord,\nthe one you love Is sick.'\nOn his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb\nfor four days. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out\nto meet him, but Mary stayed at home. 'Lord,' Martha said to Jesus, 'If\nyou had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that\neven now God will give you whatever you ask.' Jesus siad to her, 'your\nbrother will rise again. 'Martha answered, 'I know he will rise again in the\nresurrection at the last day.' Jesus said to her, 7 am the resurrection and\nthe life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and\nwhoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?'\n'Yes, Lord,' she told him, 7 believe that you are the Christ, the Son of\nGod, who was to come into the world.'\nWhen Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell\nat his feet and said, 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not\nhave died.'\nWhen Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along\nwith her also weeping, he was deeply moved and troubled. 'Where have\nyou laid him?'be asked. 'Come and see, Lord,' they replied. Jesus wept.\nThen the Jews said, 'See how he loved him!' But some of them said.\n'Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man\nfrom dying?'\nJesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb: a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. Take away the stone,' he said. 'But,\nLord,' said Martha, the sister of the dead man, 'by this time there is a bad\nodour, for he has been there l our days.' Then Jesus said, 'Did I not tell\nyou that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?' So they took\naway the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, 'Father, I thank you that\nyou have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the\nbenefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent\nme.' When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, 'Lazarus come\nout!' The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of\nlinen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, 'Takeoff the grave\nclothes and let him go.'\nExtracts from John Ch.11\nNew International Version\n\n"

Adams, one of the Hot Zjoo lea ladies. who was awarded colours al Ihe ACM\nNEW ABORTION POLICY IC Union have again changed their mind on abortion and are\nnow supporting free abortion on demand.\nIn a remarkable about turn the Union's annual general\nmeeting reversed policy passed at the previous Union meeting\nand decided to support the 'Abortion Law Reform Association'.\nProposing the motion, Merche Clark said that each woman should\nbe able to make up her own mind on abortion. She called for an\nincrease in day care abortion facilities.\nAn anti-abortion amendment proposed by Barry Austin called lot-more help for women who have babies. The meeting accepted his\nproposals but did not pass a section demanding full legal protection for\nthe unborn child.\nFollowing heated discussion the meeting, which was better attended\nthan the previous meeting, passed the motion by a large majority, thus\ntaking IC Union back to its earlier position of support for abortion. The\ndecision means that IC Union will not have to press lor withdrawal\nfrom the 'National Abortion Campaign' by the University of London Union. The meeting was also the\noccasion to r the annual presentation of Union General\nAwards and Social and Athletics\nColours. U GAs go to people\nconsidered to have given outstanding service to the Union. This year the recipients were\nUnion President Mary Atten\nborough. Secretary Mike Elkin,\nformer External Affairs Officer\nSheyne Lucock and IC Radio Station Manager John Allen.\nAcademic Affairs Officer Roger\nStotesbury and Deputy President\nMalcolm Brain received special\nthanks for their work.\nAs a parting gilt Sheyne\nLucock generously donated his\nlife-size Dalek to the Union. The\nDalek has resided in the Union Building during Sheyne's period\nat IC and is now here to st av. TEN TORS SUCCESS\nFor the first time an RCS team of six men has succeded in completing\nthe Army's annual two-day Ten Tors expedition on Dartmoor. The\nteam was the only non-service team to complete the 55 mile route and\ncame in 4th out of 20 teams of which only 6 finished the course.\nThe team consisted of Chris Fox, Stuart Blackman, Mo Misra, Michael\nPantalouris, Dave Partridge and Neil Trask. A womens'team managed\nto complete the shorter 35 mile course.\nThe men started off at 7.20 on Saturday morning and kept up a relentless 3 mph pace until 10.10pm with only one 10 minute break.\nCamping just below the sixth tor their night's rest was short and they\nwere on their way again at 5.10 on Sunday morning.\nThough the course is 55 miles as the crow flies the actual distance\nwalked was nearer 70 miles. Many of these miles were ascents, about 25\nmiles were in Dartmoor's notorious peat bogs and much of the route\nwent through depressingly bleak country.\nA map reading error by Chris Fox did not help matters by adding\nanother 2 miles and half an hour to the route.\nOnly one of the team, Neil Trask, was truly physically fit enough to\ncomplete the course. For the rest it was a question of \"mind over matter\"\nin overcoming pain, blisters and tiredness.\nEarlier the meeting ratified the\nelection of several people who had\nbeen nominated unopposed.\nThese were Austin Reeve as\nF ELf X Business Manager; Scott\nMurray as Mineral Resources\nEngineering Departmental Representative; Colin Palmer as\nUnion Publicity O Hire r. following the discovery that his\nopponent Richard Hud die had\nleft College; Gary Nicholls as\nAcademic Affairs Officer: Tim Hillyer as External Affairs\nCommittee Secretary; Celia Martin. Sally Heslop and Alastair\nMcKim on as ordinary members\nof the External Affairs Committee; and Mike Town. John Tidy and Mark Wiszowati\nas members of House Committee.\nAn election was held for two\nmembers of the Union Finance\nCommittee in which the\ncandidates were Chris Webb.\nLorraine Elston and Bob Bradley.\nThe meeting ended with Gary\nDearmer proposing a vote of\nthanks to the Executive followed\nby the official handover to the\nnew Executive.\nEX EDITOR SENTENCED Former FELIX Editor Oily Dow son pleaded guilty to charges of deception and theft from the\n' Student Travel Centre' at\nKnightsbridge Crown Court this\nweek. After atrial lasting two days he\nreceived a three month sentence suspended lor two v ears. He was\nordered to pay compensation and costs.\nThe offences were committed during1977 when Mr Dow son was an employee of the Student Travel Centre in Loudon, and involved payments for services\nrendered by the Union print unit. Oily Dow son was FELIX Editor in197273 when the post\nwas not sabbatical. MAIL DESTROYED IC Union stall have destroyed all mail addressed to the Arab Society. It had not been collected for live months and several warnings failed to bring about its\nremoval. No further mail addressed to the society will be\nheld in the Union Office. "

At the I CW A annual general meeting on\nWednesday she received 17 votes\nagainst 12 votes for her opponent,\nRuth Hildebrand.\nMer che Clark is a maths\nstudent and has been very active\nin Women in Science and\nTechnology. She also led the\nmove at the last Union meeting to\nrestore ICU's pro abortion policy.\nPrompted by discussions at the\nUniversity of London Union Womens\" Policy Group I CW A went on to discuss the problem ol\nattacks on women on the College\ncampus.\nSuch attacks have recently\noccurred at other London colleges\nand I CW A felt that security at IC\nwas inadequate especially in Beit\nHall. Suggestions put forward\nincluded rape alarms in Hall toilets and corridors and the\nprovision of door chains.\nWomen also felt that there\nshould be more security guards,\nand self defence classes were\nconsidered useful.\nThe UL U Students' Representative Council will be writing to\nLord Annan, the London University Vice Chancellor,\ncalling on the University to pay\nmore attention to protecting\npeople on its premises. The Womens' Policy Group is also to\ndraw up a letter to College\nauthorities asking for better\nsecurity.\nCONFERENCE RECEIVES\nGO AHEAD\nThe College have earmarked\n\u00a32000 from a Governors' fund to\nhelp IC Union organise the\ninternational technology student conference in two years'\ntime.

IC Union are alarmed at\nthis prospect and will be\nprotesting agfa in st the rise in\ntheir lobby of the Governors this\nmorning.\nThere are 116 part time\npostgraduates this session and\ntheir fees are \u00a3136 per session for\nadvanced courses and \u00a3185 for\nresearch.\nThe proposal is to make them\npay as much as full time students\nfor their course.

He said that\nR CSU \"does not par attention to\nundemocratic minorities''.\nIn reaching its decision the\nCommittee had felt that Smoking\nConcert in its present form\nlowered the prestige of RCS Union.

I was very pleased with the final motion, a composite of Mer che Clark' s main motion and Barry Austin s amendment. ICU policy now supports a woman's right to choose whether she\ncontinues to carry her child( and to this end advocates an improvement in daycare facilities) as well as supporting changes in society which, hopefully, will reduce the need for\nabortions.\nThe whole business was dealt with fairly swiftly, despite\nextensions to the speeches, and I congratulate Malcolm Brain on his very com pc tant handling of the debate.\nI understand that Barry Austin intends to set up the PAI' A society out of his own pocket, and I would like to wish him the best of luck in this venture. Copy Deadline Yes! Once again I mention deadlines in my Editorial. This time it's to prevent any confusion that may arise over next\nMondays Bank Holiday. The deadline for next week's issue only is 2 . 0 0 pm TUESDAY29 th. After the trauma of the last Bank Holiday Iam not accepting copy after 2.00pm. Many Thanks to Sonia and Colin for their, as always, prompt news service;\nShe y ne for typing and paste-up and especially John as he has got\nan exam today ( which he didn't tell us about). Congratulations to Austin for becoming next years Business Manager and without Simon Miner's invaluable advice concerning dairy produce I doubt that this issue would have come out at all. I will listen to all of' Through Midnight' next Wednesday as a token of my gratitude. I would, however, appreciate it if a certain other member of IC Radio stopped intimidating my staff.\nCheers, John. Don't forget the\nGovernors5\nLobby\n10:00am on today\nco nld from Page 2\nThe womens' rights lobby\nbelieves in the woman's right to\nchoose what becomes of her body.\nIt is my contention that a woman\nhas every right to do as she will\nwith her own body. Thus it is her\nright to have sexual intercourse as\nshe pleases within the restrictions\nof the moral code to which she\nsubscribes.This act involves the\nclose cooperation of her husband, who equally has every\nright to choose what becomes of\nhis body. \u2022 Today a number of\nmethods of preventing conception\nexist, of which at least one is\nacceptable to the vast majority of\npeople in the Western World.\nTherefore in the overwhelming\nmajority of cases, conception\noccurs either by choice, or\nthrough ne g lie gence. Once a child has been conceived it has a seperate, though very dependant\nexistence; it is itself an individual\nwith rights.\nHaving chosen to conceive a child, the woman's right does not\nextend to destroying that child\nsimply because it is inconvenient.\nThis surely is the ultimate in imposing beliefs - killing someone\nwho does not fit in with your own\nplans. I would like to point out\nthat it is not purely a woman's problem. The father has an equal\nresponsibility for the child, and in\nits future.\nIn conclusion I submit that it is\nnot a contradiction for a Womens1\nRights campaigner to support a movement opposed to abortion\non demand, in fact if she believes\nin rights for anyone at all, then it\nis her duty to give such a group\nher full co-operation.\nYours sincerely,\nK Brennan\nElec Eng1 SMALL A DSI CYCLE OWNERS\nTo those of you who bring\ncycles to the College, please\nmake sure you use very stout\nchains together with equally\nstrong locks.

He and his\nwife Sue had arrived in Samos a few days previously. Hoping to forget his turbid London life in performing his annual metamorphosis into a three week Greek, he had been trapped in his own cocoon and now lay tangled in a limbo of despair. Why had his wife's news so depressed him when children are supposed to\nbe God's blessing on a union? He stared forlornly from the hotel window. Sue had gone shopping earlier that morning. When she first anounced her pregnancy he had shown all the\nelation and enthusiasm of a father to be. So far as he knew, Sue had not\nrecognised any pretense in his pride and love.\nStill the morning dragged on oblivious. He wished he could leave this wretched place... He knew however that he could not flee the mournful Spectre that sniggered maliciously behind his back. For as long as Sue and he had been lovers, Peter had never had the courage' and humility to confess to her his infertility. Ever since the doctor had told him of his failing it had been his most closely guarded secret. At times he\nhad even deceived himself into thinking it was all nonsense, he was as fertile as the next man. But always these rays of optimism would be cut out by the\nshadowing body of solid cold truth. So his wife had a lover! The insidious thought lav in wait lor him wherever he might wander, a shadowy torturer, and his mind was filled with this fact until it seemed\nstretched to breaking point. At any moment it must snap and leave him...No! Every sinew in his body screamed that this treacherous thought, this fact, would leave. He needed peace, to think, to understand... Sue had never been unfaithful to him; could never be unfaithful to him. Yet... surely ...? How often had she been adulterous? He could not rest in such uncertainty. He was falling, falling, in avoid of anxious a path v, with no real desire to stop himself. Christ! Women nauseated him. Life nauseated him. Everything had gone stale on him; a latter day Hamlet, whose work, whose achievements, whose ambitions all seemed utterly futile. A blight had wasted his garden. His trust, his love, was an unwanted melon, overripe, which had dropped to rot in the tangled undergrowth ignored. For the outsider Peter and Sue had been blissfully, enviably married, a wedded harmony of love without dissension. A few\nminor arguments had interrupted the How oi their love's stream, but a steads deep understanding joined their souls as in viola bly separate and united physical entities. He pondered a while longer, recalling all they had gone through together, all they had shared, and how it had all seemed so\nworthwhile. The shadow had formed into a solidbody. Revenge! He must and would have revenge. Such terrible. Greek revenge... But he would wait. The flavour would improve with age -and one half ol delight is in the anticipation. They should cancel the rest of their vacation. Alter all. she needed proper care and attention now - for her bastard child. She had said that the Greek doctor had stressed the\nneed to conserve energy, and hew are the sun. She was a frail creature anyway, and so easily fatigued... IHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII Illlilll\n'Gel out of my house!' Sue yelled. 'Gel this\nwhore out!' From a pallid face, her eyes blaze danger and jealousy. Lucy, Peter's paramour, dressed hurriedly and departed amidst a heavy silence.\n'Peter, how could you bring another woman to our\nbed, how could you?' She was more hurt than offended. She cried softly but painfully, with the bewildered honesty of a child. Peter remained unmoved. A close observer might have traced a malicious satisfaction behind the handsome mask grown on to the face.\n7.i this why you wanted to hurry back from\nGreece:' To screw your lover?' She was bitter, and the only pity she could find was her own.7 knot vI'm ten years older than you, and perhaps it's beginning to shim: Bui to /ling my age in my face!\n7 o pick up some whore on the street! 1 on could have\nbeen more discrete. Bui you wanted me lo know,\ndidn't you? You did it deliberately. You bastard!'\nDeep, heart-felt sobs punctuated Sue's wondering soliloquy. Even Peter sighed he avil v. Then he flared: about me anyway. He 'What do you care\naffected contempt.'\\\\ hal do you mean? Who are you? Who do you\nthink I am? And I never had a lover..\\'o, and I would\nnever humiliate you like thai. Hon could you /real\nanyone like thai? And why? Why?' Her voice whispered and trembled, yet was supported by an unquestionable integrity. She nursed her head in her hands, rocking to assuage the\npain, as if she could no longer lace the man for\nwhom she had divorced her first husband and left her two children. Peter was silent, frowning. He revenge was\ncomplete, vet something felt wrong. And he\nwas almost ashamed of what he had done. 'And lo choose today Sue moaned. She looked up.7 went lo see the doctor his morning.'\nWot again! l our backache? Or was if your\nmigraine this lime?'\n'.\\o.. Veil her oj I hose.'\n'Then what!' Peter bellowed irrationally. 'He told me I'm not pregnant at all'\nA pause. 'You mean ... Are you telling me that\nCreek doctor made a mistake?' A slight but\nsolemn movement of Sue's head. 'Yes, Peter, I have an abc ess on Ihe womb. The\ndoc/or thinks a hysterectomy will be necessary.'\nSue's voice faded, and a fresh flood of tears\nbathed her cheeks. But Peter was beyond noticing. His eves stared sightless ly as his lips\nquavered a small 'Cod'.\nIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll\n'How do you feel, then, pel?' Peter inquired tenderly, presenting his wife with the\nobligatory offering of ted roses. She had undergone the operation two days previously, and at last the doctor had allowed his visit. Her complexion was pale, but her\nlips managed a brave smile.'1 he doctor said I 'll be fine. There was no\ncomplications. Oh Peter! I'm so glad we are still\ntogether. I could never have faced this alone.' He bent forward and received her kiss. He seemed uneasy, and drew back, glancing round the room:7 have some news /or you'\n'What is il?' Sue prompted.7 am lo be a father. Lucy has my child.' He had spoken to Lucy the day before; along time ago. At first he had laughed in her face. But in the end she had convinced him.7 wanted you lo know before...' he stammered. 'Before?'\n'Before you came out of hospital.'\n'What are you going lo do?' She broke the\npregnant silence. She feared the reply. There was a kind of bravado in Peter's 'Nothing.'\n'Nothing al all. I 've suggested she have an\nabortion, and I think she'll agree. After all, she's only eighteen, and unattached. Good, so the subject's closed. And by Ihe way, I 've booked us a holiday in\nSamos.'\nA warm smile lightened Sue's weakness. Her anxieties were at an end. Despite all his\nfaults, or perhaps because of them, her\nhusband was (he most wonderful man in the\nworld. Peter smiled, but said nothing. He swished away a solitary fly which had landed on his\nsleeve;\nby - G Hall and J Newland Howard\nand\nRos\nare happy to\nannounce\ntheir\nengagement. "

Chalmers has an arrangement with Imperial whereby students can choose to spend their fourth year\nstudying here (on MSc courses). We have presently got about 17 such students.\nOther than to better student relations between Chalmers and Imperial the trip was also inspired by the great level of\ndemocracy, with considerable representation for students, staff and representatives of industry that exists by law in all colleges\nof higher education within Sweden.\nTHE JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS A number of the cle b rations were annual spring events enlarged lor\nthe celebrations: others were specially arranged.\nThe first event was a cocktail party lor friends of the union. Many other technical institutes brought crazy presents but the most amazing\nwas the end of a pipeline presented by Pripps, the local brewery,\n(apparently the Student Union has shares in Pripps and every year at\nthe shareholders meeting the Union has spoken for the construction of a pipeline to Chalmers).\nThe second event I attended was the showing of the annual Spex, a musical play written and produced by members of Chalmers since\n1938. This year's was called Nero. The essential thing about Spex is that\nthey include various drinking songs which are then added to the\nvocabulary of snap ps and punch songs sung while drinking during\nmeals. The Spex are recorded each year and the company tour the\ncountry for a couple of we ks. They are very professionally produced.\nI then went to the Jubilee Spring Ball attended by representatives of\nthe local town council as well as past and present rectors and other local\nfigures. We sang lots of songs and I learnt the rules of how and when to\ntoast people. On Saturday (28th) the town concert hall was taken over\nfor a jubilee concert. Lots of Chalmers students performed, singing,\nplaying and dancing with some invited groups from other technical\nuniversities and from the locality. On Sunday they took over Liseberg\n(a sort of Battersea f unfair) and there were fireworks at the end. On Monday there was the annual 'rag' procession, (only it doesn't raise\nmoney for charity), where lots of very impressive floats depicting\nvarious satirical scenes about political and social issues were watched by\nan estimated 100,000 members ofthe Gothenburg public (despite the\nrain). This annual even takes place during the Spring festival which is\nalways on 30th April,( even if it's snowing, which it did at times). On Tuesday, l st, and Wednesday, 2nd, f had nothing much to do but try\nand find out about the University and the Union. I had a long discussion with the Rector of Chalmers and discussions\nwith the six sabbatical officers (Chalmers is about the same size as\nImperial), some students from the Engineering Physics department and\nthe Chairman of the Postgraduate Board.\nTHE UNIVERSITY AND THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT There are a great many laws that are made relating to the\nadministration of Universities and education generally. The\nUniversities are financed by the University Chancellor'solf ice. This\nnow deals with all areas of higher education as a recent restructuring ol\neducation linked every institute of higher education with some\ninstitution that does some research and they are therefore all now called\na university. For instance, because of this, Chalmers has gained a naval\ncollege which is now part of the University's technology. The\nGovernment appoints professors, although associated professors are\nappointed by the institution. The structures and the democracy within\nuniversity institutions is also laid down by Government. One of the\nmost interesting procedures is the requirement by law on the Principal\nof any institution to appoint an advisor for any major policy decision to\nbe taken. The advisor can be anyone in the employ of the state who will\nthen conduct an investigation and recommend a decision. The\nUniversity Board is not bound by the decision of the advisor but their\ndisagreement must be recorded.\nTHE UNIVERSITY COMMITTEES The University Board (Governing Body) has representatives of\nindustry, teachers and students.\nThe Education Board which takes overall decisions on educational\ngoals of the university is similarly composed.\nEach Department has a school committee which looks after the\nteaching provision. These consist of 12 people, one third students, one\nthird academic stall', and one third representatives of professions and\nindustry.\nThe research students play a similarly important role in faculty\ncommittees, with about 20% student representation.\nTHE UNIVERSITY There are about 4,500 students at Chalmers, most of whom are on\ntheir four year undergraduate courses to Masters degree. There are\nabout 500 research students. The University is organised into 6 schools,\nEngineering Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture. The total budget of the University is 250 million kroner (\u00a3\\ = 9 kroner).\nAbout a125 million of this goes on research, of which 55 million is in\nresearch contracts. Undergraduates can, and generally do, take longer\nthan the l our years to complete their course. Courses are organised in 8\nweek blocks, 7 weeks studying and 1 week of exams. This happens four\ntimes a year, so there is no 'sudden death' period during the summer as\nwe have in Britain. Three courses are taken in any 8 week block and 45 -48 passes are needed to get a degree. Some courses can be taken from\nGothenburg University in the Arts and Pure Sciences. A school at\nChalmers may buy a course from another school, eg in particular,\nMaths. I chatted to some students from the School of Engineering\nPhysics about their courses. Their Union Committee has been\ndiscussing extending their courses to training and communications,\npublic speaking, etc. and in English. Presently they have three years of\ncompulsory courses, a small amount of choice in the third year and no\ncompulsory courses in the fourth year.\nTHE WORK OF THE UNION The. Union structure is quite complicated and there are many\ninteresting differences with our Union( and similarities). There are no\nUnion General Meetings although School Committees are elected by\nGeneral Meetings. The Union Council of 35 is elected by college-wide\nballot, with a strange electoral system which seems to give an\nunreasonable bias to student 'parties'. The Council elects the 6\nsabbaticals which make up the Board ofthe Union. The Board sets up\nmillions of sub-committees.\nPostgraduates have a Board of their own, and two to three General\nmeetings per year.\nThe Union sometimes has referenda, for instance, a recent referenda\ndecided to put the prices up in their refectory, (which is run by the\nUnion), by one kroner, and simultaneously to improve the quality and\nadd a salad serving.\nChalmers Union is a member of their National Union, which has as a part of it a National Union of Technical Students. The National Union of Technical Students has recently been running a long discussion\nprogramme about the future of technical education. A part of this\ndiscussion was the amount of practical training that should be part of a degree, (at present you have to do relevant work for at least four\nmonths).\nGothenburg Student Union, the area organisation ol students, deals\nwith Welfare issues, none of which are dealt with in an v way by the\nUniversity institutions themselves. It is the Student L'n ion which is also\ninvolved in housing. The Student Hall is run by the Town Council with\nrepresentation by the Union and no involvement whatsoever from the\nUniversity.\nAn interesting difference in the Union is thai the clubs that exist\nreceive no recurrent grant from the L'n ion and have to be self-financing, although they may put in an application for provision of\nequipment.\nThe Union is financed by a compulsory donation from all of the\nstudents in the University. There was a recent major .debate in\nParliament about whether student union membership should be\ncompulsory and it was decided that it should remain so. There are no\ntuition fees charged to students so the Union fee of about \u00a3i0 is only\nexpenditure in order to study.\nI apologise for the disorganised way in which I have presented this\nmaterial, but if you want to find out more about Chalmers, then you\ncan always try and dig out one of'the students over here on exchange, or\ncome and have a chat with me. It was a very worthwhile visit and I hope\nwe will continue close relationships with the Students Union there.\nMary Attenborough\nPresident ICU "
