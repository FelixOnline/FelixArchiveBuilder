    "content": "Reviews\nTHEATRE\nThe Tempest\n(The Old Vic)\nThe Tempest is not one of\nShakespeare's more exciting plays.\nIt is often bogged down with long,\nuninspiring conversations, and is\nconfined to just one set. But, the\nfascination many have towards it\ncomes from the correlation the play\nhas with colonialism, and its strange\nmagical aura.\nJonathan Miller's new production\nat the Old vie tackles the colonialism\ntheme head on, and possesses that\ncertain aura. But, on the whole it is\nso complacent that it fails to\nimpress.\nFor those unfamiliar with the\nstory, it goes as follows:\nProspero is the un sur ped Duke of\nMilan, who has been overthrown by\nhis brother Antonio and the King of\nNaples, Alonso. Prospero and his\ndaughter, Miranda are marooned on\na tropical island, the only other\ninhabitants of which are the savage\nCaliban and a spirit, Ariel whom\nProspero enslaves with a powerful\nspell.\nA violent storm bring Prospero's enemies to his island, and so, using\nhis magic he prepares to exact his\nrevenge upon them.\nWhat follows is a study in such\ntraits as love and loyalty, as Miranda\nfalls in love with Ferdinand, the son\nof Alonso; of repression and\ntyranny, with Caliban and Ariel\nyearning for freedom from\nProspero; and of submission and\nambivalence, when Prospero\ndecides he cannot carry out his\nintentions, but has to make his\npeace with Alonso, for the sake of\nMiranda.\nThere is also a sprinkling of\nhumour, in the form of other\nshipwrecked characters.\nThe star cast includes Max Von\nSydow as Prospero, the cornerstone\nof the play, and Alexei Sayle in the\ncomic role of Trincula.\nAlthough an impressive and\npowerful presence, Von Sydow\nseems somewhat uneasy with the\ntext. He seems to worry so much\nabout the words that he fails to\nproject the character. On a number\nof occasions he seemed to stop the\nperformance with an arresting jolt,\nrather than keep it moving smoothly.\nAlexei Sayle is a lot more\nsuccessful as a loud-mouthed\nthug\u2014a part tailor made for him. He\nis there to provide some badly\nneeded levity to the play, and\nachieves it in his typical over-the-top\nway.\nThe acting on the whole, is of a very high quality. Especially good\nis newcomer Rudi Davies as the\nnaive and war f like Miranda.\nHowever, one comes away from\na play like this feeling unsatisfied.\nThe play lacks any suspense or\ntension, but whether this is due to\nthe text or the production, I'm not\nsure. Still, the director could have\nmade his point with a lot more\nconviction. It was as if we were\nsupposed to think, there is a star\ncast, a famous director, a renowned\ntheatre, so it's bound to be good.\nBut it stops there, and the\nproduction doesn't prove how good\nit is. Indeed, the set, which can be\ndescribed as 'Channel Four-esque'\ndetracts much of the attention. It\nconsists of two rather odd, large\nslanting cubes, in the midst of a breen desert scenery.\nThe Tempest may hold some\nintellectual interest, but as a drama\nit is rather insipid.\nStudent standbys are available at\n\u00a36.\nSumit Guha.\nFILM\nDistant Voices,\nStill Lives\nIt is rare that a film, which follows\nno tangible plot, and which is\noccupied by everyday, normal\npeople, doing everyday normal\nthings, can be described as totally\nengrossing, but Terrence Davies'\nDistant Voices, Still Lives is just that.\nThis detailed essay on life in the\nNorth during the forties and fifties\nis divided succinctly into two halves\n(called Distant Voices and Still Lives\nrespectively). But it is there that the\nnatural order of the plot ends, as the\nfilm consists of a series of recollected\nscenes from the various characters'\nlives, as if the cast's collective\nconscious was reminiscing about\ntheir lives. (The random sequence\nof the scenes intensifies the feeling\nof recollection\u2014who reminisces\nchronologically?)\nAlexei, Ariel and a cube\nBOOK\nA Land in\nFlames\nDavid Marcus, Corgi, \u00a33.99\nTake a widow (ahh), her two frisky\ndaughters (ooh-er), an evil estate\nmanager (boo-hiss) and an\nembittered peasantry (hurrah). Set\nthem in Ireland in the early 1920s and light the blue touch paper.\nThe story, written one suspects\nwith half an eye on a television mini-series, is the familiar plot of the\nthousand British B movies. The once\ngreat Odron estate is in decline and\nthe ambitious estate manager wants\nto own it all (don't they always in\nthese books?), with enough love\ninterest thrown in to keep the\nboredom levels down.\nThe novelty I suppose is the Irish\nsetting, however, the characters are\nun sympathetically drawn and only\nHalloran, the Sinn Fein leader,\nspeaks passionately for Ireland. The\nother characters are walking\nCliches, the kind hearted Dixon type\nPoliceman, the studious socialist\nand the quiet, ineffectual shit or. All\ngood stuff, but essentially vacuous.\nThe writing is literate but verbose.\nFor example growing a few flowers\ntranslates to 'coaxing a meagre\nquorum of lupins'.\nThe ending is remarkably\npredictable, and tidy, with enough\nroom for a sequel. If a long train\njourney beckons I suppose you\ncould do worse, but not much.\nOh, one last thing, the wild gypsy\nis on page 208.\nMike Bell.\nThe first half opens with the\nfuneral of a man (Peter\nPostlethwaite), and continues with\nhis family's various collections of\ntheir relationship with him. The\nmemories are a mixture of some\nidyl ic childhood scenes, which are\ndominated more by scenes of the\nfather's severity and harshness,\nwhich has been cultivated by a Catholic upbringing and extreme\npoverty. Glimpses of his tenderness\nare revealed, but his rigidity and\ninability to live is matched only by\nhis wife's immense capacity for\nforgiveness and love.\nThese scenes, along with the\nscenes the children's inevitable\nrebellion against their father's regime, are inter cut with weddings,\nfunerals and outings to the pub,\n(again reinforcing the theme of\nreminiscence).\nThe second half continues the\nlives of the family and their friends,\nand turns its attentions to the\nsuffering women under men's ignorance and insensitivity, which\nis instilled through their\nadvantageous position in society. It\nconcentrates on the three children;\nEileen, Tony and Maisie, who are\nvery close (the deeper the cut, the\ncloser the binds?).\nBasically, Davies' film is about\nhow people survive the drudgery of\ntheir own lives. Through the\nexcellent script (which is also\nDavies') which is devoid of\npretentiousness and carrion\ndialogue, and the superb ensemble\nplaying of the cast, the film breathes\nlife into time-worn themes, such as\nhuman dignity surfacing in the\nharshest of circumstances, and how\nwe deal with our problems by\navoiding them, rather than\nconfronting them. It's illustrated\nhow mass media pills, such as\nsongs, radio and cinema merely\ngloss over everyday pains, rather\nthan curing them.\nThe background details, such as\nthe dirty brown colours which\npr evade every scene, the songs\nwhich are intrinsically interweaved\nwith the general flow rather than\nstanding out like obvious set pieces,\nand even the weather conditions all\nserve to compliment the feeling of\nthe film, which, although it deals\nmainly with pain and the mundane,\nis an uplifting experience.\nThe stillness and slow sweeps of\nthe camera let's the eye observe in\ngreat detail and it is a film which\ndemands to be observed. It is\nCoronation Street with class and\nclarity. It is a rare film.\nNoel Curry.\nOctober 28 1988 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nFisher Hall\nBlues I Dear Bill,\nI am writing to draw your attention to the\nextortionate amenities charge being levied in\nFisher Hall this term. On top of the rent rises\nalready discussed in FELIX, the residents are\nbeing asked to pay \u00a317 amenities charge for the\nterm, which is considerably higher than last\nyear's charge. This will generate around \u00a33,000\nfor the Hall's fund this term.\nSo what will all this money be spent on? The\nwarden, Dr Richard Murphy, has refused to give\na breakdown of what the money will be used for\nand how the figure was decided. We are several\nweeks into term now and the only social event\nso far has been a cheese and wine party. In fact,\nthe Hall committee has only just been elected this\nweek. Will they be able to spend all the amenities\nmoney before the end of term? Last term the Hall\nwas smaller, the charge was only \u00a310, and still\nthe Hall committee had great difficulty finding\nenough events to spend all the money on.\nThe newspapers and video are unlikely to come\nto more than \u00a3500. Can we expect the remainder\nto be spent on social events, at a rate of \u00a3350 per\nweek for the rest of term? Well, what have the\nsub wardens been up to so far? There appears to\nbe some degree of incompetence here. For\nexample, the kettles have not yet been distributed\nto the kitchens despite the fact that they've been\nsitting in the Hall office for nearly two weeks. The\nmost recent excuse given was that 'Two of them\nhaven't got plugs yet'.\nAnd what about the mail? The post office drops\noff the first post by 9.30am every morning.\nHowever, it doesn't ever reach the residents'\npigeonholes until 9.30pm. Many residents have repeatedly complained\nabout this, but nothing has been done. And yet\nthe sub wardens are being paid the equivalent of .\n\u00a340 per week in free accommodation. Is it too\nmuch to ask that in return for this they try to do\nsomething for the residents?\nUntil we are shown some justification that we\nare getting our money's worth, the feelings or\ndiscontent amongst the residents will not\ndisappear!\nName withheld by request.\nFisher Hall\nBlues II\nDear Editor,\nLast week the residents of Fisher Hall were in\nuproar over their rents. Why the rent rise? Why\nthe extra week? Until they took time to read\naccompanying letters of course, which pointed\nout that the invoiced amounts were actually fair.\nWhat appears to have escaped most people's notice is the extortionate ly high 'amenities'\ndemand placed upon us. We are asked to\ncontribute \u00a3 1 7 per term for services aimed at\nimproving or enhancing our social lives in Hall.\nYet after three weeks we have only just elected\na Hall committee (by a dreadfully poor system).\nThey will make no decisions for at least one\nfurther week. Over one third of the way through\nterm we h ve nothing to show for the \u00a36.18 per\nperson already 'spent'.\nNotably, there is no position vaguely\nresembling treasurer. Who is to decide where the\nHall's \u00a39000 is being directed?\nHaving spent last year closely associated with\nthe committee in Hughes Parry Hall, (one of us\nwas treasurer and vice-president), we are well\naware of the expenditure necessary to support\nthe far more active social life available there.\nSeveral major parties, heavily sub sidi sed theatre\nand concert trips, an oen ology group, \u00a32000\nsubsidy on a Hall Ball, and much more. All in\naddition to the sports teams, videos, films,\nnewspapers, special dinners, bar, and basic\nfacilities (cooking, washing, sport) provided as\nessential activities. This was done on a budget\nof \u00a35000, catering for 280 students, compared to\n170 in Fisher Hall.\nAnyone in doubt should ask a current HP\nresident. They'll tell you about Ronnie Scott,\nGeorge Melly and other musicians visiting this\nyear. Nobody will complain about the social life\nor grumble about the financing.\nWhy Fisher Hall can ask so much and show so\nlittle, not a budget or even a planned events list,\nis demonstrative of the d is organisation fundamental to the accommodation system at\nImperial.\nWe only hope that members of other Imperial\nHalls are not suffering a similar treatment, or at\nleast are better informed than ourselves.\nYourse sincerely,\nMR Condon\nJP Davies\nIP Mercer\nA Clarke\n(Fisher Hall, 23/10/88)\nPoor Taste\nDear Sir,\nWe were horrified and sickened to read the\nsmall ad on PC Blakelock's death, which we\nfound in extremely poor taste. What is just as\nsickening, however, is to find that the editor of\nthe College magazine saw fit to print this ad.\nYours faithfully,\nCrispen, Steph, Clem, Simon\nMoan\nI am just writing to set the record straight on\nthe continuing difficulties that I am having in\ngetting stuff printed in FELIX.\nAt the start of term I handed in two cartoons\nand one article for the 'Alternative' page. When\nthey didn't appear in the subsequent issue I rang\nto find out what had happened. You told me that\nas the Union page had not arrived, you could not\nprint this page. Although I pointed out that you\ncould have easily reduced the Finbar Saunders\ncartoon and fitted some of the stuff in, I accepted\nthis excuse and your guarantee that all the stuff\nwould be printed in the next edition. All, that is,\nexcept for the mild parody of 'The Last\nTemptation of Christ', which you found\npersonally offensive. You are the only person I known to have done so, out off he many who\nknow about or have seen the cartoon. I was\nannoyed and did complain about this.\nThe following week most (not all) of the stuff\nI handed in was printed, although the cartoons\nwere untitled and the article had the wrong title\nand was signed, when I asked for it to be\nanonymous. There was also a letter written by\nyou (presumably) parodying me for complaining\nabout not having my stuff printed (which I did\nnot do), while neglecting to mention your\npersonal censorship of a mildly controversial\ncartoon which could have provoked debate on\nthe subject (a situation ripe for parody).\nI have since had problems getting articles, such\nas film reviews, being printed, despite getting\nthem in on time.\nI hope that these problems have arisen merely\nbecause it is the start of the year and you are still\ngetting used to the job, for to encourage people\nto spend their valuable free time writing stuff for\nFELIX when they're unsure of whether it will\nappear or not (or whether they'll get it back if it\nis artwork they want to keep) is going to be very\ndifficult.\nYours sincerely,\nNoel Curry.\nPS. If anyone wants to see the 'banned'\ncartoon, it will hopefully be appearing in\nBroadsheet shortly.\nX Love you boo - f ti'H w Sexist\nDear Bill,\nI was disappointed that your editorial policy\nallowed the publication of the article about Roy\nHicks 'Holiday Snaps'. In a college which is\nattempting to attract women students on the basis\nof equality with men, the article promoted a view\nin total opposition to that goal. Sexist and pur ile it pandered to discriminatory attitudes which\nshould find no place in a quality student\nnewspaper.\nYours sincerely,\nTonya Hills (Ms), Computing 2.\nBaronist\nDear William,\nWhat has happened to 'The Baron of\nCheapskate'? FELIX is much poorer without it.\nBring it back.\nYours sincerely,\nRouben A Drain.\nPage 2 FELIX October 28 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Music\nMUSIC IN THE RA Wi ALBUM Short, Sharp,\nShocked\nMichelle Shocked\nRecently there seems to have been\na spate of talented, female singer-songwriters (Suzanne Vega, Tracy\nChapman and Michelle Shocked,\nbeing three). Michelle's first album,\nTexas\u2014Camp Fire Tapes was released\nearly last year and was a live, solo\nalbum recorded with a Walkman at\na Texas folk and country festival.\n(Honest, you can hear the crickets\nchirping in the background.)\nDespite the rough production, the\nsongs shine through with energy,\nwit and feeling. Ms Shocked is\nclearly a talented songwriter.\nShort, Sharp, Shocked is a departure\nfrom the first album in two areas.\nOne, it is produced to a very high\nstandard and two, Michelle plays\nwith a backing band (ranging from\nelectric guitars to harmonica). What\nhasn't changed is the excellence of\nthe songs. Quite a few of the songs\nseem to be written from personal\nexperience as a youngster in East\nTexas. Making the Run to Gladewater\ntells the story of a trip out of a 'dry'\ncounty to buy alcohol; V.F.D. tells\nthe story of an accidental fire set off\nby a dangerous prank (\"The fields\nwere black, the sky was grey...'n' you know them barns they used to\nstore hay in?'). Many of the songs\nhave a very bluesy beat to them; If\nLove was a Train and When I Grow Up\nare pure blues. The L&N Don't Stop\nHere No More is a ballad commenting\non the decline of the mining\nindustry whilst Graffiti Limbo is a protest song over the miscarriage of\njustice.\nIf you like to hear talented\nmusicians, down to earth lyrics and\nsongs which take you places, then\nI would buy this album. Short,\nSharp, Shocked; Texas Campfire Tapes\nand Disoriented (a12\" single) can be\nfound on the Cooking Vinyl record\nlabel. A single called Anchorage has\nbeen released and is taken from the\nShort, Sharp, Shocked album.\nAndy Mellor, Mech Eng 3.\nLIVE\nThe Wedding\nPresent\nTown & Country Club\nI arrived at the Town and Country\nshortly before the second support\ngroup came on, at least that's who\nI think they were.\nIt was odd, everyone was chatting\nquietly amongst themselves, then\nsuddenly, unannounced, there\nwere some people on stage. They\ndidn't introduce themselves, they\njust started playing some wish y was hy songs which sounded like\nEverything but the Girl with\nsomething missing (the girl\npresumably). The crowd started\nbullying them but the band-with-no-name put on a brave face and\ntrickled through the rest of their set.\nI felt sorry for them when the crowd\ncheered them off, but sympathy\nisn't something a group should\narouse in you. Who was that\nmasked man?\nSometimes, when you write these\nreviews, you can get tired of\nthinking of appropriate metaphors\nand 'clever' things to say. You run\nout of clich ed adjectives and you\njust want to tell it straight, so here\nit is.\nThe Wedding Present are bloody\nmarvellous, a 'bit cuddly' and\nviolently motivating. I have not seen\na bigger crowd reaction, it was more\nfurious than the Pogues, Motorhead\nand SLF put together with still a little room for the Damned.\nIt must be Dave Gedges 'cute'\nsmile and full Yorkshire accent that\nincites the audience and fills you\nwith adrenal in. The songs thrash\nout one after another, thoughtful\nlyrics agitating the crowd into a frenzy.\nGood music, good songs, good\natmosphere, good guys. Shit hot-go and see them.\nHEY\nget some\nEnt Music\nHit the\nWednesday\nnight discos\nin the\nLounge\nThe Stars of Heaven\nThe Big Dish\nULU\n'.. here on the John Peel wing-ding\nwe throw our hats in the air to the\nStars of Heaven'. So said He when his\nband did a session for the Peel\nshow. My feeling is that it must\nhave been a slightly different Stars\nof Heaven that night. The sound was\njust not quite right somehow, they\nsounded scratchy and unrehearsed.\nOnly songs like Widows Walk could\nrise above this to give us a glimpse\nof the true sparkle of the stars.\nThe Big Dish know exactly what's going on, they now have 20-20\nvision. I say 'now' because when I saw them play in Glasgow two\nyears ago they were jumpy and\namateur and seemed destined for\n'also-ran' dom. Tonight they were\nexcellent.\nThe first thing I noticed was the\nsound quality; record perfect. It is\nobvious that the group are much\nmore confident now, this comes\nthrough in their playing and stage\nmanner. This 'fine sound' is a trait\nof many of the newer Glasgow\nbands like Hue and Cry, Love and\nMoney or Deacon Blue, like them or\nnot they sound polished.\nThe band also looked good, which\nis not always important but is so\ncompletely to their sort of image,\nThe aesthetics well taken care of,\nI could concentrate on the songs.\nMost were from the Swimmer and all\nwere excellent. They have a very\ndistinctive sound epi tomis ed by\nsongs such as Prospect Street with its\nclear melody and sharp notes,\nnothing smudged.\nThe lead guitarist (who looks like\nMichael Elphic\u2014Boon) has a disturbing rock n roll habit of raising\nhis left knee and straining his face\nwhenever he plays a power chord.\nThis looks out of place next to the\nsubdued, modest bassist and the\nconfident, understated James Leslie.\nThey can't miss.\nIt is rare for a support band to merit\nanything more than a passing\nmention but so entertaining were\nBrendan Croker and his merry cohorts\nthat they deserve a full review.\nCroker, judging by his accent is from\nsomewhere up North but when he\nsings he sounds reminiscent of Bob\nMarley which is ie dal for the light\nreggae influenced music they play.\nIt is not pop, and I fear they will\nnever attain the dizzy heights or\nsuper stardom because of this but\nthe reworked covers of songs going\nback to the twenties were delightful\nand had the attention of the\naudience throughout; unusual for a supporting act.\nThe voice was less effective on\nsome of the boogie numbers but the\n5 O 'Clock Shadows more than made\nup for it with their skillful playing,\nshowcasing their talents without\nshowing off. If you ever fancy a good night out this group are\nwarmly recommended should they\nbe playing at a pub venue near you.\nC.D. L. Flesh 4\nLulu\nMarquee\nIt's been a long time since Flesh have\ntoured. Whether this is good or not\nis debatable. I think they have\nfinally shrugged off their goth image\nand following for a much more\nmundane audience. Gone are the\nflowing black capes and white faces\nsmothered in eye liner and replacing\nthem\u2014short hair and 501s. Flesh only did a few old songs, but\nas they haven't played for a year it's not surprising. The 'oldies' they did\nwere all of the fast and furious type\nfrom the three LPs, probably to keep\nthe devoted happy. All the new\nsongs were slower and involved\njan gly or acoustic guitars from Rocco\nsporting a cleaner hair style.\nEven though the Flesh boys have\nbeen together for five years now\nthey still haven't achieved the\nnotoriety achieved by some other\nin di bands, for example The Cult.\nEven their so called break of doing\nthe title track to Some Kind of\nWonderful (called I Go Crazy) has not\ncatapulted them to stardom, yet.\nMaybe the change in style will.\nCheck out the single I Go Crazy or\nsee them live on October 28 at the\nSavoy (Tuffnel Park) and decide if\n/ou agree with the title of the LP.\n'.ong live the new Flesh.\nB.J.

Our guide showed us\ninto the 'Hock Cellar', a huge,\npartly-underground vault originally\nused as a cask-store but now a reception room containing many\nitems of Fuller's brewing equipment\non display and with a bar in the\ncorner. We were given a brief\ndescription of the brewing process\nand the usual 'malt grain tasting'\nand hop sniffing' took place. This\nis where the raw materials of beer\nare passed round for\nconsumption\u2014an essential ritual on\na brewery visit.\nWe were also given a brief history\nof the company. There has been a brewery on the site since 1660\nthough the original John Fuller only\njoined the enterprise in 1829.\nWe left the Hock Cellar and\ntoured the rest of the brewery.\nUnfortunately, much of the older\npart of the brewery was not\nincluded on the tour and closed\nstainless steel fermenting vessels\nand computerised control panels do\nnot hold the same appeal as the\n'traditional equipment' still seen in\nmany breweries.\nWe returned to the Hock Cellar for\nanother brewery trip ritual, the free\nbeer and sandwiches! We were\njoined at this point by the Assistant\nHead Brewer who was able to\nanswer our numerous questions\nabout the brewing process. The bar\nwas closed at 5pm and after some\nexcellent beer we left the brewery\nonly to pause after 50 yards to visit\nthe Fox and Hounds and Manson\nArms to try 'Mr Harry', Fullers new\nguest beer.\nOur next trip will be to Kin and\nBarnes in Sussex, details at our next\nmeeting on November 3 in the\nUnion Crush Bar featuring\nTheakstons Old Peculiar.\nIC EXPEDITION\nWe are hoping to run an expedition\nduring the three month summer\nholidays to the Amazon jungle.\nAnyone interested in joining the\nexpedition should send a note via\nthe internal mail to either Gideon\nSmith, Physics 2 or Margaret\nAderin, Physics 2 as soon as\npossible (by Thursday 3 November)\nstating your name, age, nationality,\ndepartment, status (undergraduate\nor postgraduate) and relevant\nexperience (if any).\nThis info plus a personal financial\ncontribution of \u00a3400 per party\nmember is stipulated by the Imperial\nCollege Expedition Board (that's equivalent to \u00a334 per week\u2014not bad\nwhen you consider you'd be paying\nat least that to stay in London and\nyou wouldn't get to fly half way\nround the world!).\nPage 5 J FELIX October 28 1988\n\n"

It is a true story\u2014so\nem passion ed that it will surely put\nthe name of Hanna Senesh on the\nlips of the world, as Anne Frank's is.\nHanna has grown up in a cultured\nand pri vele ged Hungarian\nenvironment. In the late 1930's, with the advent of Hitler, the rise of\nanti-semitism and Hanna's emerging recognition of herself as\na jew, she foregoes a career in\nwriting to study at an agricultural\ncollege in Palestine. She is\neventually asked to join a team of\nvolunteers, all from various\nGerman-occupied European\ncountries, to be trained by the\nBritish as a commando and spy.\nThinking she has found a way back\nto Budapest to help the 800,000 jews\nin refuge there, and also to see her\nmother, she signs on. The team of\nsix are drilled by Squadron Leader\nMcCormack (Anthony Andrews)\u2014\nan arrogant Scotsman with an anti-female bias.\nWhen Hanna and a companion\nattempt to cross into Hungary they\nfind themselves surrounded by\nGerman soldiers with no escape.\nHer partner commits suicide and\nHanna is arrested. The subsequent\nphysical and psychological torture\nwhich she undergoes at the hands\nof the Hungarian state eventually\nmakes Hanna crack. She is\nremarkable in her refusal to give up\nthe resistance 'code'\u2014but reveals\nher true name.\n^ With super-human courage\nHanna survives her sadistic\ntreatment, and when she eventually\nhas to stand trial as a traitor she\ndelivers a passionate speech that\nstirs the con cie n ce of the judges.\nWhen the time comes for her\nsentencing, the judges decide to flee\nrather than seal her fate, but to no\navail. Her Hungarian torturer, out\nof his own perverse sense of justice\ninstitutes his own punishment-death by firing squad. Hanna, not\nyet twenty-four, is executed.\nOn the surface of it, Hanna is a woman who set out to do\nsomething and, quite frankly,\nfailed\u2014clearly not obvious film\nmaterial. But this film reveals a new\ninsight into the Second World\nWar\u2014the unwavering determination and steel-strong spirit a naive individual is capable of\ndisplaying. It is a declaration of\nfreedom for jews, a total non-acceptance of the sting of anti-semitism. You cannot watch this\nfilm and be unmoved.\nCert PG.\nWe have been blessed with the\nrelease of a spate of extremely well\nmade and very entertaining\ncomedies in the last couple of\nweeks\u2014Midnight Run, A Fish Called\nWanda, and now Big.\nBig stars Tom Hanks (Splash,\nDragnet) as Josh Baskin, a twelve\nyear-old boy who has been\ntransformed into a35 year-old man\nby a carnival wishing machine. He\nwishes to be 'big' in order to woo\nclass beauty Cynthia Benson, but\nwhen the wish is mysteriously\ngranted he finds himself suddenly\nthrust into an adult world, for which\nhe is utterly unprepared. His\nmother thinks the big Josh has\nkidnapped the small Josh, and his\nbest friend Billy is the only one who\ncan help him out.\nTogether they go off to New York\nto find the wishing machine, and in\nthe meantime Josh gets a job with\na toy company. He quickly moves\nup to vice president, when the boss\n(Robert Loggia) realises how good\nJosh is at tuning in to what kids\nwant. With success comes a romance with Susan (Elizabeth\nPerkins) but also the em n it y of a Tom Hanks makes it Big\nTHEATRE\nDead Dad\nDog\nRoyal Cou\nRoyal Court, Sloane Square\nA two-man show about an\n'unemployed yuppie'?...whose\nfather, twelve years in the grave,\npops down from heaven for a day,\nlinked to his son by an invisible\numbilical cord which promotes\nacute a pen dic it is if the two stray too\nfar apart. Which means that the not\nover-welcome father has to follow\nhis son around to job interviews,\nand to a first date with a girl he's been per suing for months.\nWhat can I expect?\nWell Dead Dad Dog, despite its\nrather cumbersome title, pro trays all\nthese improbable events, and many\nmore, with astonishing panache, the\nlike of which this little reviewer has\nrarely seen. This play sparkles with\nwit, gusto and style. I went in\ngrouchy, thinking about a problem\nsheet, and came out grinning from\near to ear.\nDead Dad Dog follows Eck and his\ndad around Edinburgh, watching\nthem bicker and squabble and\nreminisce, and throw out\nobservations, almost unnoticed, on\nthe change of the fabric of life in this\ncountry over the last decade.\nIt is extremely difficult to write\nabout the North/South divide\nwithout becoming either bitter or\nblas e; to consider the change in\nattitudes and expectations of\nsuccessive generations without\nnost ali gia or clich ed satire. To mix\nbitter, upwardly-mobile executive\n(John Heard).\nBuffetted by new found\nresponsibilities and a much more\ncomplex emotional life than he ever\nimagined, Josh begins to change.\nBut before long Josh finds the\nmachine and has to decide whether\nto stay as the successful 35-year-old\nbusinessman, or return to his lost\nyouth and family.\nTom Hanks has always had a childish exuberance about him, and\nso is perfect as Josh Baskin. His\nperformance accurately captures the\nnaivety, energy and innocence of\nyouth and elevates the\ncharacter is ation to a different\nlevel\u2014that of total be liev ability. This\nis a remarkable performance that\nhas already propelled him to\nsuper stardom in the States.\nThe humour comes with a steady\nstream of brilliant comic set pieces,\nsuch as the toy shop scene in which\nHanks, without an inkling of\ninhibition, experiments with the\ntoys; and a cocktail party scene, in\nwhich he turns up in a white\nsequined tuxedo, and delights us\nwith his eating habits. But there are\nalso touching moments like when\nwe feel for a lonely, forlorn Josh in\na seedy New York motel room. Both\nfacets to the character are developed\nwell.\nAn impressive production\nensemble includes director Penny\nMarshal, a former comedy actress,\nproducer James L Brooks, who gave\nus Broadcast News, and Robert\nGreenhut, who produced most of\nWoody Allen's films. The film will\nleave you with a warm feeling inside\nand I can guarantee that you'll be\nhumming 'Chopsticks' as you leave\nthe theatre.\nSumit Guha.\nin humour is hard to even\ncontemplate. Dead Dad Dog not only\nmanages all this, it triumphs in it,\ndancing over the tightrope of\ndifficult issues with pure sparkling\njoy.\nThe play is well written,\nbeautifully acted, by a duo with a rare feel for split second comic\ntiming, and originally translated to\nthe stage. Never clich ed, never dull;\ncontemporary to its gritted teeth,\nbut timeless also in humour and\ntouchingly detailed observation.\nDead Dad Dog neither drags its\nfeet, nor tries to fly way over its\n(delighted) audience's head, but\nruns joyfully along. Go and see it.. .1\nmay well see you there.\nSusan Appleby, Maths 2.\nPage 12 FELIX October 28 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nIslam An opinion article by\nIslamic Society.\nPart II\nThe Prophet has to prescribe a moral\ncode, enunciate the principles of\nculture and civilisation, lay down\nthe mode of worship, establish a framework of belief, and define the\nmoral imperatives, which must\ngovern our life. The Prophet\ndetermines the rules which should\nform the basis of social and cultural\nrelationships, economic, judicial,\nand political dealings, matters of\nwar and peace, and international\naffairs. The Prophet does not\ntransmit merely a code of ritual\ncommonly regarded as 'religion'.\nHe brings with him a whole system\nThey did not succeed\nbecause of the\nprejudice and\nintolerance of the\npeople\nof thought and action which is called\nAl-Deen (a complete way of life) in\nIslamic terminology.\nThe mission of a Prophet does not\nend with the announcement of this\nway of life to the world at large. He\nhas to guide the people who follow\nhim, explaining to them the\nimplications of the Islamic creed, the\nmoral code, the divine injunctions\nand commandments, and the form\nof worship that sustains the whole\nsystem. He has to demonstrate, by\npractice, the faith he preaches, and\nhis life should be a model which\npeople may be able to follow to\norganise their own lives. He must\ngive training to the individuals and\nthe muslim society as a whole to\nprepare them for practical\npart ici a pti on in the evolution of\nIslamic culture and civilisation. The\nbelievers must grow under his\nguidance into an organised\ncommunity engaged in establishing\nthe Islamic system of life so that\nGod's word should prevail upon all\nother words.\nNot all the Prophets completely\nsucceeded in this mission. There\nwere many who failed not because\nof any personal fault or inadequacy.\nThey did not succeed because of the\nprejudice and intolerance of the\npeople or because the circumstances\nwere not favourable. But every\nProphet had the same mission, and\nit is a fact of history that Mohammed\nsucceeded in establishing the\nKingdom of God on earth, as it is\nin the heavens.\nThe audience of the Quran and\nProphet Mohammed was the whole\nof mankind form the very outset,\nand those who accepted the word\nacquired the status of believers\nwithout any distinction. At no time\nwas the invitation\" of the Quran\naddressed to the people of any\nparticular area, race, tribe, colour or\nlanguage. The Quran always calls\nupon the 'progeny of Adam' or 'the\nmankind' to accept Islam. The\nspecific in stu rct ions and in ju ct ions. are meant for those who have come\nto believe in Islam and they are\nalways addressed as 'those who\nbelieve'. That the message of Islam\nwas universal in character is proved\nby the fact that those who accepted\nthe message acquired equal rights\nand status as believers, regardless\nof all differences of origin. The\nQuran says, 'the believers are all like\nbrothers'. The Prophet said: 'those\nwho subscribe to our beliefs, and\nadopt the Islamic way of life, have\nthe same rights and the same\nobligations as we have.' The\nProphet announced, 'Listen! you\nhave one God as you have one\nfather (Adam). There is no\ndistinction between an Arab and a non-Arab. There is no preference for\nNo one can claim to\nbe a law giver on\nGod's Earth\nthe black over the fair, or the fair\nover the black. There is distinction\nonly in submission to God. The\nmost virtuous among you is the\nmost honourable in the eyes of\nGod'.\nAmong the fundamental of Islam\nthe mot important is belief in one\nGod not just the conviction that He\nexists or that He is one\u2014but that He\nalone is the creator, Master, Ruler,\nand Administrator of all that exists.\nThe universe exists because God\nwills it to exist, it functions because\nGod wills it to function, and God\nprovides the sustenance and the\nenergy which everything of the\nuniverse requires for its existence\nand growth. All the attributes of\nSovereigny reside in God alone, and\nno one else has a share in them in\nthe slightest degree. He alone\npossesses any of those attributes.\nHe views the whole universe, and\nall it contains, in a single\ninstantaneous glance. He has direct\nknowledge of the universe and all\nthat is there in the universe. He\nknows not only its present but its its\nfuture, as well. This omnipresence\nand omniscience is an attribute of\nHe has direct\nknowledge of the\nuniverse and all that\nthere is in the\nuniverse\nGod alone and no other. There was\nno 'before' Him and no 'after' Him.\nHe has been there always and will\nbe there always-eternal and abiding.\nAll else is transient. He alone is\neternally living and present. He is\nno one's progeny and He has no\nprogeny. Whatever exists, beside\nHis self, is His own creation, and no\nother can identify himself in any\nmanner with the Lord of the\nUniverse, or claim to be his son or\ndaughter. He is man's single Deity.\nTo associate anyone in His worship\nis a great a sin as it is an act of\ninfidelity. He responds to man's prayers and He alone has the power\nto accept or reject them. Not to ask\nof Him is senseless arrogance, and\nto turn to others is sheer ignorance.\nTo seek of Him, and also of others,\nis to associate equals with Him.\nThe sovereignty of God in Islam\nis not just a supernatural\nphenomenon. It covers all aspects\nof political and legal sovereignty also\nand in these too no one other than\nGod has any share. In God alone\nrests the rightful authority to\nexercise power on this earth, and\nover those whom God has created\nin it. No monarch, no elite class, no\nleader of any religious group, no\ndemocracy established on the basis\nof the sovereignty of the people, can\nparticipate in God's sovereignty.\nWhoever claims such a position is\na rebel, as are those who leave God\nand turn to other people in\nobedience. Similarly, any institution\nor individual attempting to assume\npolitical and legal sovereignty and\nrestrict the jurisdiction of God to\nspheres of personal law or ritual\nduties, is really a usurper and a rebel. The truth is that no one can\nclaim to be a law-giver on God's earth, and no one can challenge the\nsupreme authority of God Almighty\nin any sphere. Another\nfundamental creed of Islamcomplete submission to God\u2014is\nbelief in the hereafter (Akhirah).\nDenial of the hereafter is the d in i al of Islam even though one may have\nbelief in God, in the Prophets (peace\nbe upon them), and the Quran. Man\nhas not been unleashed on the earth\nan irresponsible savage. He is\naccountable to God for his actions.\nThe judgement will rest on one\nquestion: Did man conduct himself,\nin submission to God, in strict\nconformity with the truth revealed\nto the Prophets, and with the\nconviction that he will be held\nresponsible for his conduct in life on\nthe Day of Judgement? If the answer\nis in the affirmative, the reward will\nbe Paradise, and if in the negative,\nHell will be the punishment. Those\nwho believe in the hereafter in the\nform which Islam represents it, do\nnot delude themselves that they\nhave nay special relationship with\nGod, or that anyone can intercede\non their behalf. They know that they\nalone are responsible for their\nactions. For them the belief in the\nhereafter becomes a great moral\nforce. A person who has the\nconviction th t he is fully accountable\nfor all his actions finds a permanent\nguard, stationed within himself,\nwho cautions him and admonishes\nhim whenever he deviates from the\nright path. There may be no court\nto summon him, no policeman to\napprehend him, no witness to\naccuse him, and no public opinion\nto press him, but the guard within\nhim is ever on the alert, ready to\nseize him whenever he transgresses.\nThere can be no greater instrument\nof moral reformation nor any better\nmethod to help man to develop a sound and stable character. It is the\nThe same moral code\nwhich one observes at\nhome applies to one's conduct in public\nhereafter which helps man, under\nall circumstances, to conform to\nGod's scheme of permanent values.\nA little earlier, I mentioned that\nIslam represents a whole\ncivilisation, a complete culture, and\na comprehensive order. It provides\nmoral guidance in all walks of life.\nThat is why Islamic values are not\nfor the ascetic who renounces the\nworld, but for him who actively\nparticipates in different spheres of\nlife, and works within them. The\nmoral values for which people look\nin secluded worship places, are\nPage 8 FELIX October 28 1988\n\n"

The\njudges' decision is final.\nHELP!\nWe require people to help with the\nproduction of FELIX. The post of\nSports Editor still remains vacant and\nanybody interested in becoming part\nof this small, friendly team should\ncome and see Bill Goodwin in the\nOffice (top left hand corner of Union\nBuilding) at any time.\nRecipe\nBy YISHU NANDA\nI have never been treated to such a display of Spanish gastronomic\nw izzard ry. Maria Luisa Fernandez\nof Chem Eng was in total control as\nshe demonstrated the art of making\napa ella to a keen group of\nonlookers\u2014including the FELIX\ncamera.\nThe pa ella, one of Spain's internationally acclaimed contributions\nto the culinary world, originates\nfrom Valencia on the East coast.\nWhilst there are many variations on\nthe ingredients one can use, the\nseafood pa ella must be the most\npopular.\nIngredients\n1 small cup Uncle Ben's American long\ngrain rice\nOlive oil\n1 lemon\n1 medium size onion\n2 green peppers\n4oz cleaned squid\n6-8 mussels in the shell\n6-8 clams in the shell\n6-8 prawns in the shell\n6-8 oz chicken with bones\nSeveral cloves of garlic to taste\nFresh parsley\n1-2 canned tomatoes\nAlthough apa ella is not a difficult\ndish to make it requires substantial\npreparation of the ingredients.\nPreparing the chicken stock\nPlace the chicken pieces in enough\nwater to cover them. You might like\nto add any odd vegetables you have\nlying around to give the stock more\nflavour. Boil the chicken until it is\ncooked and remove all the chicken\nfrom the bone keeping the meat on\na plate. Throw away the bones and\nreserve the stock for cooking the\nrice.\nPreparing the muss les Buy many more muss les than you\nare going to use because they can\nalways be frozen pre-cooked. Throw\naway any muss les that do not close\nwhen tapped. Wash the live\nmuss les thoroughly, scrubbing\nthem with a brush to remove any\ngrit that might be stuck on them.\nPlace sufficient water in a pan to\ncover the muss les. Bring the water\nto the boil, add some salt and the\nmuss les. Simmer until most of the\nmuss les have opened. Throw away\nany that have not. Keep the muss le stock in reserve.\nThe clams can be prepared in the\nsame way as the muss les. The clam\nstock should also be reserved. The\nmuss les and clams can be prepared\ndays in advance. Keep them frozen\nand refrigerate the stock.\nPreparing the prawns\nRemove the heads from the tails.\nPlace in a pan of boiling water.\nSimmer until the prawns are\ncooked. Throw away heads and\nkeep the tails. You might like to\nkeep the prawns whole for as the tic value. Reserve the prawn stock.\nPreparing the squid\nRemove the backbone and the\nstomach sac. Cut the squid stomach\ninto rings and the tentacles into 2-3\npieces. Bring a pan with a little\nwater to the boil and simmer for 15\nminutes. It does not matter if the\nsquid is not tender because it will be\nfried and cooked with the rice.\nThe rest...\nAfter much ar dous preparation, the\nfinal act can begin. A good pa ella requires a large flat frying surface so\nthat the layer of ingredients never\nbecomes too thick. Do whatever you\ncan\u2014improvise by using two frying\npans if necessary.\nAdd enough olive oil to cover the\nfrying surface. Heat the oil. Add the\nchopped onion, garlic and green\npepper. Fry until the onions begin\nto brown. Add the chopped\nFood\ntomatoes and continue frying for a few minutes. Add the squid and\ncontinue frying. Add the parsley\nand rice. Keep things stirred so they\ndo not stick.\nWhilst all the frying is going on\nadd a little bit of the chicken, prawn,\nmuss le and clam stock and heat\nuntil boiling.\nAfter the rice has been fried for a few minutes add two cups of boiling\nstock. At this point the rice should\nno longer be stirred as this loosens\nthe starch and the rice becomes\nsticky. Do not cover the pan. Cook\non low heat for 25 mins.\nFive minutes before the rice is\ncooked, arrange the cooked\nmuss les, clams, prawns and chicken\non the surface of the rice.\nAfter the rice has been cooked\ncover it with a lid and let it sit for\nfive minutes.\nUncle Ben rice is recommended\nbecause it can take substantial abuse\nwithout getting sticky although in\nSpain the chefs would not dream of\nusing it.\nAs if the pa ella was not enough, it\nwas followed by a triple-bar el led dessert.\nA chocolate mousse, a Tirami Su\n(meaning cheer me up) and a trifle\nmade this culinary adventure worth\nwriting home about.\nIf you are cooking anything\noutrageous why not invite FELIX to\ncapture the event for you. I would\n|like to thank Maria Luisa for letting\n;FELIX intrude into the privacy of her\nkitchen.\nOctober 28 1988 FELIX Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "Travel\nThe Independent\nTraveller\nIstanbul holds a special place in the history of Europe. It is the place where,\ntraditionally, East met West, the only city in the world to span two\ncontinents. For centuries it was the centre of the Ottoman empire, the centre\nof an Islamic empire that threatened to overrun Christian Europe, and\nwhich reached the gates of Vienna under Suleymaniye the Magnificent.\nBefore the Turks, Constantinople, as it was then known, was the capital\nof the Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantine, which outlived Rome by a thousand years. What city in the world can claim to have been the capital\nof two world empires as well as holding some of the world's finest\nmonuments, a blend of East and West at its finest.\nToday Istanbul may no longer be a great capital (Ataturk even moved\nthe capital of Turkey to Ankara) but\nit is still one of the liveliest and most\nbeautiful cities in the world,\nsprawling on both sides of the\nunsurpassed Bosphorus. The\nmodern buildings in the city are as\nany found in European cities and\none might think for a moment that\none is in a rather dirty and shabby\nSouthern European city, until one\nturns a corner and catches sight of\na sombre grey mosque with its\nleaded roof or a row of the\ntraditional wooden houses that\ncaused so much fear of fires. The\ncity itself is split into three parts, two\nin Europe, and the third on the\nAsian side of the Bosphorus. In\nEurope is the old city, Stamboul,\nsprawling over its five hills, each\nwith its own mosque standing out\non the skyline.\nAcross the Golden Horn, still in\nEurope, is the modern city,\nconnected to Stamboul by the\nGalata Bridge, a floating bridge\nteeming with traffic while people eat\nin fish restaurants tucked under the\nroad beside the water.\nStamboul .contains most of the\nsights of the city; climb the hill from\nthe Golden horn and you will reach\nSultan Aburnet quarter, the ancient\nheart of the capital. Here stand,\nfacing each other, two great\ntemples, one built by Christians, the\nother by Muslims, Haghia Sophia\nwas built by the Emporer Justinian,\nand was for centuries the greatest\ncathedral in Christendom, and is\nstill one of the most beautiful\nbuildings in the world, even if it is\na little worse for wear. When\nConstantinople eventually fell to the\nTurks, Haghia Sophia was\nconverted into a mosque and the\nmosaics that existed were plastered\nover. This beautiful structure was\nused as the base for the design of all\nthe Ottoman imperial mosques in\nIstanbul and throughout Turkey.\nSuch was the influence of Haghia\nSophia another mosque, the Blue\nMosque, was built a thousand years\nlater. Just as refined as the original\nmosque, the Blue Mosque is famous\nfor the blue tiles that decorate the\ninterior, and, perhaps, infamous for\nthe young men outside who are so\nanxious for you to have a glass of tea\nin their Uncle's carpet shop.\nWander up the street from these\nFishermen at the Golden Horn, Istanbul\nThe New Mosque\ntemples as the broken down buses\nroar past and you will meet with\nbustling, crowded Istanbul as it is\ntoday. Stop in a tea shop to spend\na lazy afternoon playing\nbackgammon or carry on past\nancient graveyards and Turkish\nbaths jammed in between shops to\nthe Grand Bazaar. The great\ncovered Bazaar is a little city in itself;\nyou can spend hours strolling the\nwinding little streets leading off,\nwhile still under the same roof.\nAnything from gold to the\nubiquitous carpet can be bought, but\nremember to bargain, the price first\nquoted will be three times what\nshould be paid. And, as you seal the\ndeal on your 'genuine' Lacoste t shirt, yet another glass of tea will be\noffered, purchased from little boys\nwho run through the streets with\ntrays full of glasses.\nDown the hill, through narrow,\nshabby streets, each selling a speciality, towards the Galata\nBridge, is the smaller Spice Bazaar.\nHere, the streets are filled with open\nsacks of spices, nuts and Turkish\ndelight, which you are free to taste\nat your leisure as you decide on the\nbest purchase. Leaving the Spice\nBazaar, cross the square full of\ngarden stalls and tea shops, to the\nNew Mosque, facing the Galata\nBridge.\nThe harbour around the Galata\nBridge reminds one that Istanbul is\na city split in three by water. The\ndock is lined with ancient steamers\nbelching smoke, some still with\nplates marked 'Edinburgh 1887',\nthat depart for Asia, the Sea of\nMarmaris and the Black Sea. Beside\nthe water, fishermen sell fish fresh\nfrom the Bosphorus, and stalls sell\nnuts and thin, pizza like snacks you\nroll round a whole chilli. From here\nyou can take a ship to the Princes\nIslands in the Sea of Marmaris, the\npleasure gardens of the princes in\nearlier times, now holiday homes for\nthe wealthy of Istanbul.\nPerched on the first hill of\nIstanbul, at the meeting point of the\nGolden Horn and the Bosphorus is\nTopkapi palace, the pleasure dome\nof the Sultans. The luxurious\ngardens and exquisite pavilions\nhouse some of the world's finest\ntreasures; the contents of the\ntreasury are beyond value. The\nheart of the palace is the harem, the\nprivate reserve of the Sultan, to\nenter which the eunuchs paid a high\n[price. Now the price to enter is\nconsiderably less, and worth it to\nexperience the opulence the Sultans\nlived in.\nDescend again to the Golden\nHorn and cross the Galata Bridge to\nthe modern city, and take Istanbul's only tube line, with just two stops,\nup the hill to the Galata Tower. The\nGalata Tower was built by Genoese\nmerchants, excluded from the city\nproper as they were infidels, and\nnow offers some of the best views\nof the city. Look across the Golden\nHorn towards the five hills with\ntheir mosques and minarets as the\nsun sets and the Imam calls the\nfaithful to prayer, and say goodbye\nto Istanbul, for the moment.\nBy Paul Barton\nOctober 28 1988 FELIX Page 16\n\n"

Nigel Collier added\na second ten minutes later.\nThen Byron Wood stepped up a gear...into neutral, and sneaked in\na quick four to 'steal' the game.\nThey scored but who cares!!\nBy the way Tim Fisher and Paul\nOlden were also on the pitch.\nPip Peel did nothing during the\ngame, but it was his 21st birthday\nand he was saving himself for the\nperformance in the bar after the\nmatch.\nFOOTBALL\nIC vs Kings\nIC 1-2\nKQC-0\nAn unspectacular but hard working\nperformance by the firsts saw them\nnotch up a second successive win,\nagainst last season's runners-up,\nKings. Once again IC started\ntentatively with sloppy passing\nallowing King's to take the initiative,\nforcing several saves from Simon\nHolden early on. However, IC\nregained their composure and took\nthe lead on the half hour after Paul\nOlden was dubiously judged to\nhave been fouled in the box. Phil\nEwart drove the result penalty\nstraight at the keeper, who\nobligingly dived over the ball.\nKing's again pulled themselves\ntogether but were stopped in their\ntracks by the stupendous goal from\nPip Peel. Beating the entire defence\nsingle-handedly. Our intrepid\nmidfield man kept his cool and\ncalmly slotted the ball home.\nKings started the second half in\naggressive style and IC were content\nto contain them and work on the\nbreak. This they did well and could,\nindeed should have, increased their\nlead when Nigel Collier glanced a header against the bar. Kings\ncontinued to attack, hitting the post\nand forcing several corners.\nHowever they lacked initiative in\nfront of goal and IC's efficient back\nfour coped admirably. Having\nweathered the storm, IC moved up\na gear and finished off a comfortable\nwin on top.\nSKIING\nDry Slope\nRacing\nIn the first race of the year at\nWelwyn Garden City on Sunday\nthe Ski Club entered three complete\nteams (is this a record?).\nThe 1st team survived the first and\nsecond rounds undefeated, despite\nsome impromptu ballet by Anna,\nbut then faced a team who looked\nas if they lived on a dry slope in the\nfinal.\nThe 2nd and 3rd teams both lost\ntheir first races (but not by much)\nand then won the remaining races\nin the two rounds. This led to a thrilling confrontation of the two\nteams in the play-off for 7th and 8th places overall. Despite various death\nthreats and sabotage attempts, the\n2nd team won to make the final\nplacings 2nd,7 th and 8th for IC (out\nof 15).\nMENS HOCKEY Good Work\nIC 3rd XI\nHarrow Town Swans III\nAfter three successive defeats\n(including an 8-0 thrashing at the\nhands of Royal Free) the 3rds looked\na glimmer of their true potential on\na pitch looking more like the Grand\nCanyon than anything fit for hockey\nand without goalkeeper Shaun who\nbroke his finger in the warm up\nbefore the game.\nGood work in the centre of the\npitch by Martin Garer, Mark\nLansdon and John Briggs led to the\nfirst goal being scored after 15\nminutes by Steve Burton and 10\nminutes later good work in the left\nwing produced the second goal-scored with clinical precision again\nby Steve Burton.\nEarly on in the second half the\nopposition managed to save a rather\nscrappy goal from one of their large\nnumber of short corners but the\ngame was effectively won 10\nminutes later when the ball was\npicked up at the edge of the D by\nSteve Burton who hit a fierce drive\npast the advancing goalie into the\nbottom left hand corner of the net\nto complete his hat trick.\nTHOUGHT FOR THE WEEK\nTo bed or not to bed? Is this a stupid question or just a diabolical pun?\nThe advantages of late nights\ndo not include 'The Last Resort'\nwith Jonathan Ross but perhaps\nthe seasoned bursts of Batman\non Night Network are worthy of\nstaying up for.\nAs regards students getting up\nin the morning, this seems for\nmany a non starter although it\nmay have been aided by 8.30am lectures. Anyway who wants to\nget up early just to see another\ndrab London morning?\nIs this in discipline in student\nsleeping habits (fun though it\ncan be at times) a symptom of\nmore serious factors? Is the\nzombie d state that it induces due\nto an obvious lack of sleep\nresulting in stress and\nin eff ice n cy in our woken hours,\nan escapism from reality? an\nanaesthetic to the pain of\nstudent life? Moreover is it life\nthat is the pain or, are we afraid\nof quietness and spending time\nwith ourselves and our\ninnermost thoughts. Is this lax\ndiscipline in our sleeping habits\na result of us desiring to chase\nan Utopia outside our current\nexistence? Conversely, instead\nof lack of sleep being an escape\nfrom life is it instead that we\ndesire not to sleep but to escape\nfrom the nightmare of it dreams such as appearing on\n'The Last Resort' with Johathan\nWoss or more profoundly\nperhaps, a contemporary\nequivalent of Pharoh's Cows?\nWORD OF THE WEEK\nESOTERIC\nSouthkenders\nX LIKE -ft is ffc ESc Nf \u2022THAT coo Qi R GOT M \u00a3- if guT /KL-WAVS i OtS SACiC\nTb S> cU rA AL, OH, LOOK! r\\ti CX H#c OCt e'\\f A AM MV IT'S UOKCtf\no aW \u00a3 LI , 1 SUP-Pose' iCO UUP TA K fu tk AS Ke TSAll.\nOctober 28 1988 FELIX\n\n"

He described\nImperial as 'a distinguished and\nexcellent College with a world lead\nin various aspects of science.'\nHe went on to deny allegations of\n'under funding' Universities, saying\nthat he had 'provided a fund of\n\u00a3 2 5 0 M for the restructuring of\nUniversities' and had 'increased the\nspending on Universities last year\nby 10% and for next year by 8%.' He\nadded that college mergers designed\nto save money were 'a possibility'\nalthough he felt that it was\n'essentially a question for the\nUniversities to decide.'\nThe Rector, Professor Ash said he\nthought Mr Baker's visit had been\n'very successful.' He went on to say\nthat he felt Mr Baker was a 'reasonably good listener,' and said\nthat he was 'mildly optimistic' about\nMr Baker's plans for Universities\nlike Imperial.\nCall for rent strike\nStudents have voted in favour of a College-wide rent strike in the\nSpring term if a policy to sub sid is e residences with overseas students'\nfees is not passed by the College's Governing Body. A motion passed\nat Tuesday's Imperial College Union\nGeneral Meeting requires the\nGoverning Body to transfer \u00a31000 to\nthe Residence account for every\nadditional overseas student above\nlast year's figure.\nThe motion comes in response to\nthreats of rent-strikes from residents\nof Beit and Fisher Hall. Complaints\nhave centred around this year's rent\nincreases and the introduction of a twelve week rent for the first term.\nThe College claims that the\nincreases are due to a deficit on the\nResidence Account last year of\n\u00a3170,000 with a further increase of\n\u00a3100,000 predicted for this year. The\nlaw prevents the College from\neasing the debt by transfering funds\nfrom other areas.\nThe proposer of the motion, IC\nUnion Honorary Secretary, Ian\nMorris, claims that funding from\noverseas students can be handled\ndifferently. He maintains that it is\npossible for the College to transfer\na part of the funds from overseas\nstudents to the residence account.\nHe argues that, whilst the College\nis gaining further revenue each year\nfrom an increasing overseas intake,\nstudents at Imperial are having to\npay higher rents as the College buys\nfurther loan financed accommodation. Loan-financed purchases,\nincluding that of Fisher Hall, have\nplaced a considerable burden upon\nthe residence system recently.

The National\nRadiological Protection Board\nestimates that 1,500 people a year\ndie from radon-induced lung cancer,\nout of a total of 40,000 lung cancer\ndeaths, which makes this a far more\nserious problem than any manmade radioactive hazard.

She smiled at the\ncitizen in the front of her desk and\nlet him in.\nAs he leaned back in his throne\nand looked at the citizen, Little Lord\nPatacake grinned and asked\n'What's your problem little\ncitizen?'\n'Please Mr Patacake, sir. I can't afford to live in Nibble Hall.

It is the increased risk of\ndeveloping blood clots due to\ncramped conditions on economy\nclass air flights. A three year study\ncarried out at Heathrow airport\nfound that 18 per cent of 61 sudden\ndeaths in long-distance passengers\nwere due to pulmonary em bolus( blood clot in the lung). The main\ncause is stasis (stoppage of blood\nflow) of the lower limb, exacerbated\nby cramped conditions, and\ndehydration due to ex ce sive alcohol\nintake. Journeys as short as three to\nfour hours may be potentially\ndangerous; the formation of a blood\nclot may not be noticed until it is\ndislodged by vigorous exercise after\nthe flight. British Airways claim that\nthe risks are 'infinitely small' in\nrelation to the number of passengers\ncarried; however, they recommend\nfrequent movement in the aisle\nduring the flight and stop-overs.\nThis could be achieved easily by\nBritish Rail's method of selling more\ntickets than there are seats.\nNext week\nThis year's Nobel Prize winners.\naround them.\nBack in his office, Derek Dash,\nwas talking to one of his spies.\n'What do you mean, leaving?' he\nsaid.\nThe little man was whimpering as\nMad Dash tightened the\nthumbscrews.\n'It's true, I admit it, John\nSecretary, Rob McNorthey and PC\nPlod, they're all leaving,' he\nscreamed, 'and soon!'.\nThe Baron frowned and\npondered.

It is\ncommonly known in the West as\nFighting Kung Fu and aims at\ntraining the body and the mind. It\ninvolves training with and without\nweapons. Wu Shu Kwan is\nprobably the most practical and\nformidable martial art in the world.\nWu Shu Kwan can be practised by\nmen and women, young and old, as\nan unsurpassed method of self\ndefence, as an extremely effective\nform of physical training and health\nculture and as a remarkably easy\nway of achieving confidence and\npeace of mind. Wu Shu Kwan\ntraining is a sure way of increasing\none's strength, speed, coordination,\nagility, mobility, flexibility and\nbalance.\nWu Su Kwan maintains a very\nhigh standard of instruction and is\nintended for anyone who wishes to\nachieve a fuller, happier and\nhealthier life through proven mental\nand physical training principles and\nmethods. Everyone, man or\nwoman, young or old, can benefit\nfrom competent instruction. With\neach session you will find yourself\nfitter and more proficient. As a general rule the basic skills of self\ndefence can be learnt in a few\nmonths. However, the longer you\ntrain the better you will become\u2014\nthe sky's the limit.\nTraining sessions take place in the\nUnion Gym every Sunday at\n4.30pm, with beginners classes\nstarting every week.

It was\na great honour for us to find that\nSensei Yahara, his business partner\nand several of his students had\ncome to meet us at the Airport. We\nwere then driven to the Imperial\nHotel, probably the best hotel in\nTokyo. Sensei Yahara had arranged\nspecial financial arrangements, just\none example of the kindness and\nconsideration he showed us.\nWe spent two days in Tokyo, at\nall times being escorted by the\ncaptains of the two university karate\nclubs we were to train with, they\nmet us each morning, taking us out\ninto Tokyo for breakfast and then\nsight seeing. Sensie Yahara\nhonoured us by arranging for us to\nwatch the Instructors training\nclass\u2014a privilege usually only\nbestowed on visiting dignitaries.\nThat evening Sensei Yahara took us\nall out for a Chinese meal with some\nof his friends, including two\nFrenchmen who were going to the\ntraining camp with us.\nThe next day we went to the\nstation to meet the 40 students from\nthe Japanese Universities with\nwhom we then continued on to the\nkarate camp, after two and a half\nhours we arrived at the City of\nOkahoma and, transferring to two\ncoaches, continued to wind our way\nup into the mountains. We arrived\nat a small ski resort called Oze,\nwhere we were to train. In the hotel\nwe slept on traditional Japanese\nbeds and ate Japanese food whilst\nsitting cross-legged at a table. Karate\ntraining commenced the next day,\na typical-day was as follows:\nWe rose at 6am, awakened by the\nvillage siren, and were transferred\nby coach to the dojo (karate hall), at\n6.30 kata (karate set forms) training\nwas taught at the morning session\nfrom 6.45 until 9.00am. After\ntraining we returned to the hotel for\na traditional breakfast, this generally\nconsisted of rice, seaweed, cold fish,\nblack tea and Japanese pickles.\nLunch was at noon and the\nafternoon karate session\ncommenced at 3.00pm and\ncontinued until 5.30pm. Afternoon\nsessions consisted of kumi te( fighting techniques) usually ending\nwith some 'free fighting' or a competition. On the second day the\nUniversity of London's team beat\nthe Japanese Universities team in\nthe inter-university competition.\nAfter training we returned for\ndinner, again very traditional. In the\nevenings, meetings were held\nwhich gave us the opportunity to\nask Sensei Yahara questions, and for\nhim to explain some of the finer\npoints of the day's lessons.\nAt the end of the course we had\nmade good friends with the\nJapanese students and on returning\nto Tokyo spent the evening with\nthem whilst Sensei Andrews had\ndinner with Sensei Yahara. The\npenultimate day was spent sight\nseeing around the extensive\nmarkets, including those stocking a wide variety of fish.\nAlthough we spent only ten days\nin Japan we were able to sample the\nculture in a quite unique way. As we\nwere always accompanied by\nJapanese students we had no\nserious language problems and\nexperienced the Japanese way of\nlife. The karate training was very\nhard and the spirit shown by the\nJapanese students was frightening\nat first. However, with the help of\nSensei Andrews we were able to\novercome this fear quite early on\nand train as hard as them with just\nas much spirit.\nSensei Yahara impressed us all by\nhis skill and by the generosity he\nshowed us, even though we were\nonly students. We all returned with\nnew values of respect for other\npeople and for our instructors. We\nhope next year that some of our\nJapanese friends will come to\nEngland to visit us, we can then\nreturn their great hospitality and\nthank them again for making our\ntrip so memorable and so full of\nexperiences.\nOctober 28 1988 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Feature\nOld Boy Racers\nImperial College has produced\nmany outstanding engineers,\nscientists and industrialists, but\nthree in particular stand out in the\nfield of modern motor racing. Their\ncontributions are in the three basic\nareas of the sport: engines, chassis\nand leadership.\nThe most successful Formula One\nengine ever is the Ford Cosworth\nDFV. Designed and produced in\nNorthampton, it has powered 155\ncars to Grand Prix victories and\nspawned winning variants for\nIndianapolis and Sportscar racing.\nCosworth Engineering was set up as\na joint venture between Mike Costin\nand Keith Duckworth, the latter a graduate of Mechanical Engineering\nat IC. First built in 1967, the 3 litre\nengine won its very first race at\nZandvoort, Holland, in the back of\nJim Clark's Lotus 25. Between then\nand the takeover of the more\npowerful turbo-charged motors it\nprovided the power for 11 World\nChampion drivers. The 3.5 litre DFZ\nversion is currently being used by\nseveral Grand Prix teams and will\nbe used by even more next year\nwhen the turbos are banned. In\nAmerica, the 2.65 litre turbocharged\nDFX version has won over 100\nIndycar races, including many\nIndianapolis 500s. During his time\nat College Keith was Guild's Motor\nClub captain and also 'Bo' driver.\nA lot of old Formula One DFVs\nhave found a good home in Formula\n3000, which is the category a step\ndown from Fl. One of the most\nsuccessful manufacturers of these\ncars is Lola, where IC Mech Eng\ngraduate Mark Williams is designer.\nHis cars have won races in each of\nthe last three years but have been\ndenied the championship. At 29\nyears old Mark is one of the\nbrightest design prospects around,\nand rumour has it that he has been\napproached by Minardi to design\nthe Italian team's Formula One cars.\nJaguar have enjoyed fantastic\nsuccess recently, both on and off the\ntrack. A lot of the credit for this must\ngo to the company's Chairman and\nChief Executive, IC graduate Sir\nJohn Egan. Sales of road cars have\nincreased dramatically and this has\ngone hand in hand with sportscar\nracing success. Sir John has actively\nsupported the racing programme,\nwhich culminated this year with the\n'Grand Slam' of World Sportscar\nChampion Driver, Champion Team\nand victory in the Le Mans 24-hour\nrace.\nThere are many graduates who\nhave competed in motor sport. I have get to find one who was really\nfamous, although current Guilds\nHST Paul Ewing has competed on\nthe RAC Rally in the past.\nFestival Fresher\nChris Goodwin left Imperial College in the summer\nto embark on a career as a professional racing driver.\nAdrian Bourne went down to meet him at Brands\nHatch during preparations for the most important\nmeeting of the year.\nThe DataCartel Formula Ford\nFestival and World Cup is\nconsidered by many to be the best\nmeeting of the year. 200 mainly\nyoung drivers fight it through\nqualifying, heats, quarters, semis\nand a Final. The action is invariably\nfrenetic, and there are incidents\naplenty. The prestige of winning is\nconsiderable, and is often the start\nof a rapid rise through formula three\ninto formula one.\nFormer IC student Chris Goodwin\nwill be competing for the first time\nand although an outright win is an '\nunrealistic hope, a good\nperformance will make the\nprospects for next year brighter.\nChris is one of the many drivers to\nhave started their racing careers in\nFormula First, contesting last year's inaugural championship. Some of\nyou may remember seeing Chris on\ntelevision last year when he was the\nsubject of a Top Gear documentary\nwhich followed the ups and downs\nof the season, including some fairly\nspectacular in-car footage on the\nway to winning the last race of the\nyear.\nThat victory at Brands Hatch was\nfollowed by a six month break\nduring which Chris concentrated on\nPaddock Hill Bend Druids Hairpin Clearways\nA lap of Brands\nThe Brands Hatch 'Indy' circuit is\none of the most challenging courses\nin the country. What makes it\ndifferent from airfield tracks like\nSfiverstone or Thruxton is the\nincredible change in gradient and\ncamber that the natural bowl in the\nKent countryside provides. Chris\nGoodwin describes how he drives\nthe 1.2 mi fes m just over 48 seconds,\n\"Across the start'finish line you\napproach Paddock HOI Bend in 4th gear pulling about 6,800 rpm (7,000\nfor a really good lap), which is about\n115 mph. Stay in fourth through the\ncorner after touching the brakes and\nscrubbing off a little speed by\nthrowing the car into the bend. Exit\nthe corner with about 5,800 rpm {90\nmph) Stay in fourth gear up the\nhill, braking hard just before the\nbridge and changing straight down\ninto second for the hairpin at\nDruids.\n\"Powering out of Druids as\nsmoothly and early as possible,\nchange up to third at the bottom of\nthe hill just before Graham Hifl\nBend. This corner is taken without\nlifting off the accelerator, but only\nif on the right line. Stay in third all\nalong Cooper Straight approaching\nSurtees with 7000 rpm on the clock.\nSurtees is one of the most\nchallenging bends and is taken with\nthe slightest of lifts of the throttle,\nStaighten this section as much as\npossible by using the kerbs on the\nleft and right of the track, being\ncareful not to lose control as the car\nis thrown s lig h ltl y sideways one\nway and then the other.\n\"Brake hard for Clearways and\nchange down to second. This corner\nis crucial for a fast lap and exit speed\nis all important. Accelerate,\nchanging up to third gear whilst\nnegotiating the last part of the\ncorner with one hand. Fourth gear\nis taken about one third of the way\nalong the straight, sticking to the\nright hand side next to the pit wall.\nThis way you follow a slight dip in\nthe road and also prevent the car\nbehind edging down the inside into\nPaddock (the favourite overtaking\nspot at Brands) at the start of lap\ntwo.\"\nstudying(!) and finding sponsors.\nWith the support of local office\nsupplier Versapak International,\nChris was able to start the 1988\nseason in July, by which time most\nof the leading drivers had competed\nin a dozen races already. The car he\nwill be driving is a Van Diemen\nRF88, as raced by most of the\nleading runners. Chris does his own\npreparation and is helped at races\nby his father and a few friends. At\nthe recent Cellnet Formula Three\nSuperprix support race Chris\nqualified sixth, breaking the 49\nsecond barrier for the first time\nbefore going on to finish fourth in\nhis heat.\nThe quality of television coverage\nof motor racing has been much\nimproved this year, mainly due to\nthe increased use of the on-board\ncamera and at the Festival the\nGrandstand camera will be attached\nto the roll bar of Chris's car, giving\nseveral million viewers the chance\nto travel around Brands Hatch on Photo: Ben Daniels\nhis shoulder. Next Saturday, 5th November will be when the Eestival\nis broadcast, so you can all see how\nChris got on, but for anyone\ninterested in seeing it live then why\nnot go along. Brands Hatch is on the\nA20, about 20 miles south-east of\nLondon. Nearest BR station is\nSwanley (half hourly from Victoria)\nalthough the bus service to the track\nis very infrequent on Saturdays and\nnon- existent on Sundays. Taxis are\ncheap and read li y available and it is\nnormally easy to find someone to\nshare with. Practice and heats are on\nSaturday, with the quarters, semis\nand final on Sunday. Admission\nprices are available from Brands\nHatch on 0474 872331.\nSo, if Chris isn't going to win then\nwho is? Formula Ford is an\nincredibly close category and there\nare at least 20 or so drivers capable\nof winning. The favourites are the\nseven drivers who have won rounds\nof the RAC and Esso senior\nchampionships this season.\nChampion in both series is Derek\nHiggins, driving the works\nDuckhams Van Diemen. Other\nwinners include Brazilians Jose\nCordova and Niko Palhares,\nPortugal's Pedro Chaves and Pedro\nLeita de Faria, Italy's Vincenzo\nSospiri and Britain's Richard Dean\nin his Swift. Picking a winner out of\nthat lot, not to mention the hordes\nof talented junior and overseas\nrunners is virtually impossible but\nI 'll stick with the prediction I made\nin Motor Circuit News and go for\nthe diminutive Pedro Chaves.\nAs well as the Festival, there are\nsupport races, including a Sports\n2000 race in which Chris also hopes\nto be driving and a round of the\nMinister Pre '85 FF1600\nChampionship in which there is also\nan IC interest. Former Guilds motor\nclub Captain, Steve Nixon, drives a Lola T640E which he prepares\nhimself and has rebuilt extensively\nfollowing an accident at Brands last\nyear.\nPage 10 FELIX October 28 1988 October 28 1988 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

Unfortunately most\ncomputers use numerical methods\nof solution, and as Harry points out\n'L can always arrange that the\nanswer you get from a computer is\nwrong.' It's rather like Hitch Hikers\nGuide to the Galaxy; the computer\nwill provide a numerical answer, but\nthere is no guarantee that it is the\ncorrect one for the problem. For\nexample:\nIf x=l/ Pfori = 1, 2...Pp then the sum \u00a3 xi=1 is fairly\nobvious, but because of random\nrounding off errors a computer will\nnot give this answer. As a result\nnew developments in computing,\nsuch as PROLOG and artificial\nintelligence, are using symbolic\nsolution.\nHairy spent six months looking\nthrough all the mathematics\n'fff e library for a countering this structure,\nSimilarly a looked at\nn and political\nHarry is sure\nare sound but\nlen on he needs\nin nature.

Decanting some\nstrawberry milkshake into a QT\npolystyrene cup, he starts to explain\nthe intricacies of his theory.\n'What I'm trying to do is give the\nway of solving a problem a structure, so that you eliminate trial\nand error.'\nThe technique itself came from\nlooking at the 'totality of\neverything', in particular\nknowledge, which Harry considers\nto have accumulated from solving\nproblems. This led him into\nstudying the structure of problem\nsolution, looking for a consistent\npattern, and from this he was able\nto develop his theory.\nThe first step is that all problems\nin nature can be expressed as:\nP(Y)= G where:\nP is the problem\nYa set of things looking for\nactivities\nG is the goal.\nOnce the problem has\nfor muli sed in this way it is then\ntransformed and a decision made,\nwhich gives the solution;' \u2022Aij&Jj,*\ntherein lies the problem va mm f ep, problems: transformations ca K;$f \u00a3:;';;\ndifficult to find and, of c0 \u00ab ^ # ^ ,\ndecisions can be wrong!
