    "content": "Feature\n16 December 1992 Felix 952\nAn NUS Horribilis\nDeclan Curry takes a look at the NUS students' charter and sees an\norganisation fighting for it's life\nIf it has achieved nothing else, the\nGovernment's fetish for voluntary\nmembership has caused the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\nto take a hard, introverted look at\nitself. Last week saw the NUS\npicking up its entrails, reheating\nthem in a pot, and serving them as\nthe pot age de jour. In an eventful\nWednesday, the organisation\nlaunched its much leaked students'\ncharter. Of more significance, it\nalso held the first meeting of its\nnewly formed National Council, the\nvery body set up to circumvent the\nloony excesses of the Winter\nConference. One in the eye for the\nTrots, that.\nThe Students' Charter was bound\nto receive most publicity, not least\nbecause it was leaked to the Times\nthe week before. Well, the Times\ncalls it a leak. The NUS say that it\nwas 'strategically placed' with a sympathetic journalist and an\ninfluential newspaper. Well, at least\nthey got it half right.\nHalf right was also an overheard,\nif underhand, description of the\ncharter when it was launched at\nTUC House. Hmmm. The NUS\nspends three years convincing us\nthat they are not a trades union, and\nthen launch one of their most\nimportant documents at the\nheadquarters of the Trades Union\nCongress. 'Holloway Road (the site\nof the NUS headquarters building)\nisn't big enough,' said a spokeswoman. 'We're expecting\nover 100 people for the launch'. In\nthe end, no more than 25 people\nwere in the room. Pass that shotgun\na bit closer to your foot, there.\nFor an educational document, no\none with a distinct educational\nbackground was invited. William\nWaldergrave, Minister for the\nCitizen's Charter and Whitehall's paperclip convenor, got an\ninvitation for the launch and used\nit to test his shredder. The three\npoliticians who did turn up were\nMark Fisher, Labour's junior\nCitizen's Charter spokesman, and\nMatthew Taylor, Citizen's Charter\nspokesman for the Liberal\nDemocrats, so fairly junior as well.\nThe third politician was Dermot\nKeohe, the NUS Vice President for\nThe old NUS, sit ins, marches and\nEducation. As I said, no educational\nbackground.\nThe NUS Students' Charter had\n10 'rights'; the right to access, the\nright to flexibility, the right to\nfinance for study, the right to\naccommodation, the right to learner\nagreements, the right to extracurricular facilities, the right to\ngood teaching, the right to\nrepresentation, the right to\ncomplaint and appeal, and the right\nto reward.\nThese rights were to be enshrined\nby the key recommendations,\ndetailed in the box. Dermot Keohe\nsaid that the recommendations were\nstudent centred, with 'quality and\nchoice as a priority'. It was, no\ndoubt, a desire for choice which led\nto the NUS to 'come out' in favour\nof semester is ation. Under semester is ation, the\nacademic year has two 'teaching\nunits' or terms. Each term is of\nfifteen weeks, and is known as a semester. Semesterisation is being\nexamined by almost every\nuniversity in the country, and some\nhave already proposed\nsemester is ation of one type or\nover paid sabbaticals.\nanother. King's College London\nand University College London\nhave started to implement three\nterms, the first two being 12 weeks\nlong, with a third term of only six\nweeks. This allows for a longer\nrevision period, and shortens the\nusually ineffective summer term.\nThe University of Stirling and\nLiverpool John Moores University\nhave two 15 week semesters, with\neach semester lying either side of\nChristmas. The first semester starts\nin early September, and, after a five\nor six week holiday, the second\nsemester begins in early February,\nending in mid May. The\nUniversities involved say that their\nscheme allows a summer study\nscheme to be developed. The\nNorthern Universities Interim\nProgramme proposes two twelve\nweek teaching semesters, each\nbeing followed by a three week\nassessment period. This allows the\nfirst semester to straddle the\nChristmas break, as the first\nassessment period takes place after\nthe holiday.\nOne of the criticisms of\nsemester is ation is that it could lead\nto 'fast track' degrees, that is\nstudents finishing their courses in\ntwo years. This innovation would,\nof course, rock the academic world\nto its very foundations, and would\nend educational civilisation as it has\nbeen known for over 40 years. Yet\nthe unthinkable has happened in that\nbastion of free enterprise, the\n(private) University of\nBuckingham, prop. M Thatcher,\nBaroness. In a career move from\nFirst Lord of the Treasury to\nChancellor of the University, the\ngood lady has the dubious pleasure\nof presiding over a three semester\nyear, that is September to January,\nFebruary to May, and May to\nAugust. Be warned. Our own\neducational bastion, Imperial\nCollege pic, is looking at a possible\nintroduction of semester is ation. Given that the great Cashier, Sir\nEric Ash, once said that courses\nshould start at eight in the morning,\nit is not beyond the bounds of\nreason that we could see something\nsimilar. Unless you believe the\nUnion president, Chris Davidson.\nIn a recent note to Imperial College\nUnion Council, the kilt ed one wrote\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "N ews\n16 December 1992 Felix 952\nWestward Ho Breaking up\nby Andrew Tseng\nImperial College student Kirsty\nDarbyshire has won $1000 after\nbecoming the 150,000th participant\nof the British Universities North\nAmerica Club (BUNAC). The 30\nyear old club exists to enable young\npeople to combine work and travel.\nThe BUNAC programme allows\nstudents to take almost 'any job,\nanywhere' in North America over\nthe summer vacation. Commenting\non her award, to be spent on travel,\nKirsty said, 'I was thinking about\ndoing Work Canada next summer,\nso this will certainly be useful'.\nMeanwhile, Imperial College\nUnion BUNAC Society was\naffiliated to Imperial College Union\nSocial Clubs Committee (SCC) at\nthis week's meeting of ICU\nCouncil. The affiliation means that\nall members of Imperial College\nUnion can participate in the club.\nThe club intends staging a lecture\nprogramme in college to inform\nmembers about the culture of North\nAmerica, and encouraging interest\nin North American countries and\ncultures through the BUNAC\nexchange scheme. Imperial College\nUnion BUNAC society can be\ncontacted through the Union office.\nWealth created\nby Dave Goddard\nUndergraduate engineering students\nmay be in line for more money from\nthe Government. lohn Patten, the\nEducation Secretary, is considering\nextra money on top of grants and\nloans to increase the number of\npeople entering engineering as a career. The awards would be\nconditional on students promising to\nspend their early careers in\nengineering companies after\ngraduation. Similar bursa ries have\nalready been used for postgraduate\nteacher training courses.\nThe move to increase the number\nof people in engineering was\nwelcomed by engineering\nrepresentatives. Denis Filer,\nDirector General ofthe Engineering\nCouncil, said that the Government\nhad 'recognised that professional\nengineers are wealth creators', and\nadded that increasing the number of\nengineers would 'not only help to\nrebuild our manufacturing sector\nbut will also help the United\nKingdom to be more competitive in\nthe international field'.\nby Felix reporters\nThe General Union Council (GUC)\nof the University of London Union\n(ULU) held its second meeting last\nweek. The Council is the highest\nstudent body of the Union, and\nserves as the policy making forum\nof ULU.\nDelegates discussed the break up\nof the University of London,\nfollowing suggestions by some\ncolleges about d is affiliation from\nthe University. After discussion, the\nmeeting passed a motion urging\nULU to act against any break up of\nthe University of London. Chris\nDavidson, Imperial College Union\npresident, spoke against the motion\nbecause, he said, GUC rules did not\nallow him to speak without taking\nsides. Mr Davidson continued that\nhe thought ULU were acting\n'rashly', and that they could 'handle\nthe matter more diplomatically'. Mr\nDavidson later said that it was\npremature to discuss\nde federal is ation when no proposals\nwere 'on the table'. He added that\nhe felt 'isolated' at the meeting, as\nhe attracted some criticism from\nother delegates at the time.\nMark Samuels, ULU President,\ntold Felix after the meeting that he\nwas saddened that 'the Imperial\ndelegation felt isolated. Chris felt\nthe motion was targeted against\nhim, when it applied just as much\nto others'. Mr Samuels added that\nhe 'got the impression that Chris\ncouldn't speak out because he was\non the charter review working party\n(the committee set up by Imperial\nCollege to review the charter setting\nup the College)'.\nThe GUC meeting also passed a motion to act against 'fascism and\nholocaust revisionism'. This motion\nhad been proposed at an earlier\nmeeting, but had not ben discussed\nthen. GUC also passed a motion\nremoving any constitutional policies\nwhich are 'ultra vire s', literally out\nof rules, or illegal. Mr Samuels,\nULU president, denied that ULU\nwas being investigated by the\nAttorney General's office for ultra\nvire s payments. The Attorney\nGeneral's office confirmed that a written complaint had been made\nabout an earlier decision by GUC\nto subscribe to the Searchlight\nmagazine. A legal spokesman said\nthat a letter would be written to\nULU asking them for further\ndetails. Mr Samuels said that they\nhad not received such a letter, and\nthat the union had decided not to\nsubscribe to the magazine.\nAt the end of the GUC meeting,\nMr Davidson suggested that ULU\nshould carry out a review of its\nprocedures for GUC meetings, as\nhe considered them bureaucratic.\nMr Samuels responded that a report\non the union procedures was being\ncompiled.\nRethink on voluntary membership?\nby Declan Curry News Editor\nAn outline of the membership of the\nImperial College Union Working\nParty on Union structure has been\nannounced. Imperial College Union\n(ICU) Council approved the list\nduring their meeting last Monday\nnight. The Structure Working Party\nincludes Tim Cotton, Nicky Fox,\nMark Summers, Boon Yeo, and\nAndy Wensley. Also on the party\nwill be an Academic Affairs Officer\n(AAO) and a Constituent College\nUnion (CCU) president. The CCU\npresident may serve as an observer,\nas will lon a than Griffiths, last\nyear's Union deputy president.\nThe Structure Working Party was\nset up as part of a widespread\norganisational review of Union\nStructure. The review, brainchild of\nChris Davidson, ICU President,\nwas announced at a Union General\nMeeting and a Council meeting in\nNovember. Mr Davidson described\nthe current Union structure as 'out\nof date', and said that the review\nshould 'leave no stone un turned' in\ndeciding what students want from\nthe Union. Mr Davidson earlier said\nthat the 'staff side' of the Union was\n'excellent', and said on Monday\nthat staff may be co-opted onto the\nStructure Working Party.\nAs yet, no mechanism has been\nset up to allow students to make\nsubmissions to the Structure\nWorking Party, but it is expected\nthat student opinion will be\ncanvassed using 'focus groups',\nwhere small groups of students are\ninvited to give their opinions about\nthe Union. This technique, used by\nsupermarkets for market research,\nis one of several tools chosen by the\nVoluntary Membership Working\nParty, also set up by Mr Davidson.\nThis working party has already had\nits first meeting, the details of which\nremain confidential.\nMinisterial level discussions on\nvoluntary membership have been\ntaking place in a week which has\nseen some fevered activity on the\nsubject by the Conservative Party.\nGraham Riddick, back bench MP\nand prominent supporter of\nvoluntary membership, held talks\nwith Mr Forman last Thursday.\nAfter the meeting, Mr Riddick\nmoved to dampen speculation that\nthe Government has stalled work on\nthe implementation of the voluntary\nprinciple. Mr Riddick told Felix\nthat he 'was not sure that the pace\nhad slowed', adding that he didn't 'care how long it takes' to introduce\nvoluntary membership for campus\nstudent unions, 'so long as they (the\nGovernment) get it right'.\nStriking a conciliatory note in\ncomparison to earlier statements,\nMr Riddick said that it was\nimportant 'to preserve all that is\ngood about the provision of\nservices'. 'We don't want to destroy\nservices. We don't want to throw\nthe baby out with the bath water,' he\ntold Felix. Mr Riddick's comments\nreflect unease in sections of the\nConservative Party that the\ngovernment's plans may damage\nwhat is regarded as 'good' about\nstudent unions, without significantly\nresolving what is seen as the misuse\nof public funds. A source close to\na Conservative pressure group said\nthat the government had 'bitten off\nmore than it could chew', while a source in the party complained that\n'an ideological approach' had not\ntaken account of the 'majority of\ngood things' done by unions. The\nDepartment for Education is now\nbeing joined in drawing up any\npolicy by the Government Policy\nUnit. The Unit, based in the Prime\nMinister's offices in 10 Downing\nStreet, held a six hour meeting on\nthe evening of Tuesday 8th December, discussing the different\noptions on implementation of\nvoluntary membership.\nPage 2\n\n"

Tickets\n\u00a35-\u00a38.\nConcert\nThe Imperial Symphony Orchestra\nperformed last Friday to a packed\nGreat Hall.\nThey warmed up with Elgar's 'In\nthe South' a wonderfully extrovert\nand youthful piece. It is deceptively\ndifficult to play with soaring\nmelodies often supported by filigree\npassage work, particularly from the\nviolins, who therefore set the pace\nof the whole piece. The music, void\nof a deeper meaning is boisterously\nhappy roaming around in a rich and\npre dim on ant ly beautiful and sunny\ncountryside. The mood shifts a great deal, the listener is never\nbored, gladly contemplating new\nvistas as they unfold, sometimes\ndarkened by clouds and some local\nminor drama. The ruling\nimpression is joyful and sunny.\nElgar's Cello Concerto in E minor followed that extrovert happy\nromp in Southern Italy. By their\nsharp contrast the two works\ndemonstrate the breadth and\nrichness of Elgar's creative spirit.\nThe Cello Concerto is a sensitive\nexploration of an inner landscape,\ndevoid of joy; 'poor in spirit',\nrestricted as it is to complex and\ntragic feelings. An inner landscape\nKing Lear\nmirroring maybe the devastation of\nEurope's war zones, that must have\nbeen so painful to contemplate for\nElgar the traveller, who wrote this\nmusic at the end of the Great War.\nMaybe also an elegy for a lost\nfriend? Elgar's ability to identify\nwith the sad soul the cello depicts,\nwas so deep that he even could\nmake the occasional cheerful\nprompting passages from the\noutside world, (which the orchestra\nappears to represent) sound as\nmeaningless as they would\ninevitably appear to a withdrawn\nand broken mind.\nThe soloist, Lowri Blake was\ntemperamentally well equipped to\nenter into this deeply sensitive and\nsearching mood for Elgar. She had\npr vio us ly studied with Jacqueline du\nPre\u2014but rejected her reading of\nElgar\u2014finding it more vigorous\nthan Elgar had intended. Her\ninterpretation was not only credible\nbut, one felt, the result of a patient\nand receptive meditation on what\nElgar meant to say. She is a technically impressive performer\ndemanding intense concentration\nfrom the listener. The timbre and\nrichness of her tone was sadly\nmuted by the Great Hall's unresponsive acoustics. The\nvigorous playing from a substantial\nbody of strings in the orchestra was\nright though similarly dampened.\nThis was a pity but did not\novershadow the fact that the\norchestra had once again invited a winning soloist to play with them.\nIt must be merely a matter of time\nbefore she becomes a household\nname. Anyone unable to get a seat\nlast Friday should seek out the\nopportunity to hear her play this\nconcerto in the early spring of 93\nat the Royal Festival Hall.\nThose who took pot-luck and\nbought her CD 'Scotch and Soda',\nwhich was on sale in the\nintermission, had a nice surprise in\nstore. In this recording she sings\nlight music and accompanies herself\non the cello. A harp and double bass\nalso feature as backdrop to her very\nclear and good voice. May we see\nher invited back to Imperial to\nperform in this format and style\ntoo?\nProkofiev's Romeo and Juliet\nSuites\u2014were well-chosen for an\norchestra possessing verve and\nenthusiasm in abundance and very\nconsiderable skills under the\nleadership of a youthful and\nenergetic conductor.\nThe ballet suites nicely reflect the\nRussian attitude to life\u2014alternating\nbetween loud and chaotic sections,\nas passionate and undisciplined as\nRussia in anarchy, and the tic/toe\ndiscipline of a military parade on\nthe Red Square. The rhythmic\nsections in fact demand such\nmetro no mic playing that the ICSO\nconductor, who at all times helps\nhis orchestra along by bodily\nmiming the music, appeared at\ntimes almost to be animated by\nclockwork.\nContemplating this great seesaw\nof two attitudes to life and society,\none might perceive Prokofiev and\nRichard Dickins as being in cahoots\nin an endeavour to make the\norchestra ex cell: pushing them\nregularly into recklessly indulgent\nlyricism\u2014only to haul them back to\nthe most rigorous time-keeping\ndrill work. It was as if the orchestra\nwas weighed up and tested. The\nresult of the test may be surprising\nas one usually ex pets amateur\nplayers to perform most\nsuccessfully in the slower more\nlyrical passages, whilst here, in\nRomeo and Juliet, ICSO\ndemonstrated a youthful vigour and\nstrength in the rhythmic sections\nthat was thrilling in the extreme.\nAll-in-all the concert was a huge\nsuccess and a great credit to the\nsoloist, the conductor and the\norchestra. An extra tribute is\nmerited by the solo wind players.\nThe audience showed their\nappreciation by prolonged\nthunderous applause.\nOcean.\nPage 20\n\n"

Not that they would\nadvocate such a development,\nthough: They have just pinched the\nBuckingham idea, and modified it\nso th M students have the choice of\nwhich two of the three terms they\nwish to study. Perhaps it was this\ndisplay of craft which moved the\nTimes to note 'the students' union\nis at last coming up with good\nideas'.\nDid they mean that financial\nredress for students was also a good\nidea? Admittedly this is one of the\nmainstays of the Government's contagious Charter bandwagon, and\nit seems reasonable for the late\npayment of grants. 'Students should\nreceive the equivalent of the interest\nthey could have received on the\nvalue of the grant for every day that\nthe grant is late,\" they say. Or\nindeed some compensation for the\ninterest charged while running up\nenormous debts while waiting for\nthe damned thing. Some Imperial\nstudents were still waiting for this\nterm's grant when I spoke to them\nlast week.\nBut how far does this\ncompensation lark go? On IC\nRadio, Dermot Keohe said that\nstudents should receive\ncompensation for 'inadequate'\naccommodation. Whilst we all\nknow that Holloway Road is not a nice area to slum in, Mr Keohe had\nsome difficulty in deciding what\ninadequate accommodation was.\nEventually he came up with an\ningenious definition. 'Not Butlins'.\nIf you were looking for an\nhonorary degree in rugby or\nminibus driving, then the call for\n'credits for student union or\ncommunity work' was just for you.\nIf you wanted a degree of any\ndescription, you were unlikely to be\ncheered by the insistence on 'all\nteachers in further and higher\neducation to possess a teaching\nqualification'. If you wanted, you\ncould make up your own degree,\nwith an individually tailored\n'learner agreement'. 'Students are\noften uncertain of the relevance of\nspecific courses to their needs,'\nreads the document. This is\nespecially true after graduation, or\nat any stage in the Department of\nComputing. 'We need to begin with\nan analysis of a student's needs, not\nwhat teachers want to teach.\nStudents should be able to negotiate\ntheir own interim targets for\nachievements, concentrating on a students' needs and progress'. What\nif your options are changed mid-course, like in Biology at the end\nof last year? The document calls for\nstudents to have the right to redress\nshould the institution fail to deliver\ntheir side of the learner agreement.\n'This should make institutions think\ntwice,' it adds as an interesting\naside.\nAll this causes some\nwonderment. Why the fuss? The\nGovernment is due to publish its\nown further and higher education\ncharter, though not now until the\nNew Year. The 'Citizen's Charter\nFirst Report', recently published,\nproudly boasts that this piece of\npaper will give students, employers\nand the wider community 'the right\nto information about what is on\noffer and about its quality. The\nCharters may cover such matters as\nquality assessment of courses,\nmembership of student unions and\nthe setting of standards for services\nsuch as the timely and correct\npayment of grants and loans.'\nSomething borrowed, something\nblue.\nThe NUS says that earlier\ncharters have not involved the client\ngroup. 'The Parent's Charter was\nnot written by parents, nor was the\nPatient's Charter written by\npatients. Students want a say in any\nstudents' charter'. Any other\nreasons? Why not take a look at\nwhat Lorna Fitzsimons, NUS President, said to the NUS National\nCouncil on the same day as the\ncharter launch. 'Aside from the\nthreat to student unions represented\nby current Government proposals,\nNUS also suffers from more deep\nseated problems. Students, student\nunions and the wider public all have\ndifficulty in understanding the\nNUS. A perception exists that NUS\nis poor at providing information on\nservices.' Ah. Merry Christmas,\nNUS. Rest in Peace.\nNUS, strangely out of place in education's new world order\nPage 11\n\n"

Yet, at moments, the true\nBoo genius shone through.\nDuring the beginning of the\nshow, the levels were not set\ncorrectly, the vocals were too loud,\nand the overall beauty of the band\nwas destroyed. This was further\naccentuated as the band played as\na typical four man band, with the\nvocalist as for nt man-in the studio,\nwhat hits you first are the guitars,\nhorns, strings and other\nunfathomable delights. These are\nthe backbone, the strength of the\nBoos' set. The vocals merely\naccompany these, and in m ny cases\nthe lyrics are indistinguishable.\nPlacing the vocalist as frontman\ntook away the emphasis of the\nguitars so the overall sound\nproduced was flat and dull.\nThe Boos were further\nThe Pogues- Curiously divided over the standing/sitting issue.\nThe Pogues, Pele,-Brixton\nAcademy\nPele come from Liverpool. Pele are\nlike an Irish band, sounding like a cross between the early Waterboys,\nThe Levellers, and, due to an\nexcellent fiddler, Dexy's Midnight\nRunners. Songs included 'Raid The\nPalace', dedicated to Charles and\nDi, in these 'dificult times', a very\nfast cover of 'I Fought The Law',\nand the tear jerking first line of\n'Mull Of Kintyre'.\nThe Pogues were brilliant,\nalthough it's the first time I 've seen\nthem without Shane. Spider Stacey,\nthe whistle player, sang well,\nalthough some of the crowd were\ncalling for Shane throughout the\nnight. Their set was very\nChristmassy, with tinsel and\nbaubles abounding, and even a small tree (which was stolen straight\naway). The band themselves did not\nlook full of the Christmas spirit\n(rather surprisingly) when they\ncame on , but this somewhat surly\nstage persona swiftly altered as they\nbegan 'Sayonara'. They introduced\nseveral new songs all through the\nnight including 'Smell Of Petroleum', 'Once Upon A Time'\nand 'Tuesday Morning', which to\nme sounded more like their early\nrecords than their last album. The\nband seemed to hold together much\nbetter in the absence of Shane, since\nthey appeared to be a complete unit,\nnot a star and his band.\nThey played many of their older\nsongs, including 'If I Should Fall\nFrom Grace With God', a modified\n'Turkish Song Of The Damned',\n'Dirty Old Town' and 'Sunny Side\nOf The Street'. The evening\nreached it's climax with a loud\nfirework filled 'Fiesta' finale. The\nlighting crew were so pissed at this\npoint they were totally missing their\ncues. Personally I thought the\nrandom spotlighting added to the\nsong, but there were those amongst\nus who didn't agree.\nFleur\ndisadvantaged by the fct that not all\nthe instruments appearing on the\n'Boo...' eps were used live. Thus\nthe Boos' sound was further\nweakened. However, for two\nnumbers, they incorporated a horn\nplayer into the four piece, and these\nwere probably the best numbers of\nthe night.\nThe Boo Radleys are a great\nband, their distinct originality\nmakes them such. Although there\nwas no encore, with more classics\nsuch as 'Lazurus', they'll get it right\neventual y.

It can't just be those super\ncatchy tunes, in that rag g let a gg le Dexy's style. Can it? Surely not.\nHow could anyone be so\nsuperficial? How could a band\npossibly be any good without a decent techno keyboard sound\ntwiddling through the middle of\nevery song? This band couldn't cut\nit in the rave scene, know what I'm saying? No?

Our first\ncall of the wild took us to Tremadoc\nin North Wales where we\ngrudgingly slept in ultimate luxury\nin the both y directly under the cliffs\nand opposite the cafe, although the\nrain and sheep could be endured no\nmore by Saturday night (when we\nresorted to a very Cymru-ish local\ninn with Gladiators and poole table,\ncomplete with resident opponent, to\nkeep our vertical tendencies\nconsoled). Plenty of adrenaline was\ncirculated by all levels of climber,\non routes such as Plum and The\nFang.\nStannage and Froggit in the Peak\nDistrict was one up on Tremadoc\nin that the sheep prevailed but the\nrain didn't. We camped (but don't tell the National Trust) just a mile\nor so from the limestone wall (and\nless from the pub). Sarah is not too\nproud to admit that she led her first\nDiff. (\u2014the type of route you can\ndo with a zimmer frame) even\nthough Ali and Amos (otherwise\nknown as Flex and Reach) did hoist\ntheir Way up various extremes and\nMartin did a triple backwards flip\non a Hard Very Severe with no\ntrouble at all. Climbs attempted\nwere Broken Crack, Three Pebble\nSlab (which apparently doesn't live\nup to its name) and Diamond Crack,\nwhich doesn't either. Croak-an-oil,\nwhich scales its way up a pin a cle, was also one under the belt.\nCroyde in North Devon delivered\nrain but no sheep. Instead the most\nwicked cream teas you .could every\nimagine. Just a brief drive from the\ncampsite (which incidentally was a mere 100m from the bar) and a short walk along the headland and\nvoila!\u2014as far as I'm concerned the\nbest climbing yet. Brilliant a bse il s, enjoyable ascents just metres above\nthe crashing waves and some\namazing sunsets can really take\nyour mind off the fact that the tide\nis coming in! Dan can now be ultra-smug that he led and survived\nKinky Boots (a Very Severe route)\nwhich involved a rather tricky\ntraverse across a wide Crevasse.\nSarah, on the other hand, can now\nfeel inadequate due to her inability\nto do the simultaneous one arm pull\nand Olympic long jump necessary\nfor the first manoeuvre (feeble me!)\nafter she had managed to persuade\nDan to go first!\nCamping in Swanage last\nweekend did leave better weather to\nbe desired for the next trip to\nCornwall over the weekend of\n11-13th December. Anyone\ninterested in going should see the\nclub noticeboard opposite the\nclimbing wall near the JCR, or meet\nclub members on Tuesday\nevenings, after 9pm, in Southside\nUpper Lounge). However the gang\ncan give themselves a pat on the\nback for successfully traversing as kitt le alley and stone wall and also\nfor the skit tle balancing feats that\nthey can now perform with ease.\nSarah Wingrove.\nPage 1 5\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 952\n'eat ure16 December 1992\nPraise fit for a Queen?\nWhat do Imperial College Students think about the recently released prayer book for gays and lesbians? David Spooner and Tanya Nizam canvass\nour views.\nA few months ago, a prayer book\nfor same-sex couples entitled\n'Daring to speak Love's Name'\nacquired for itself some notoriety\nwith its publishing. To say that the\nchurch is divided over this issue\nwould perhaps overstate its\nschismatic properties, as it became\nrather overshadowed by the\nordination of women priests, but\nd is chord at least, is evident. The\nArchbishop of Canterbury recently\ndeclared, in effect, his personal\nenmity to the book which formally\nbrings God into the Gay\ncommunity. Opposition from within\nthe church has declared its\nunreserved support for a publication\nso necessary as a declaration of the\nuniversal love of God for his or her\nown sex.\nWith the blessing (sic) of the\nBishop of Durham, amongst other\nnotable clergymen and women, the\nbook has aroused considerable\nmedia interest. Felix sent its most\nsympathetic and sensitive reporter\nto uncover the reason behind the\noutrage and, indeed, to discover if\nthere is outrage behind the reason.\nThere is, among its supporters,\na definite opinion that before the\nPrayer-book was published, the gay\ncommunity was effectively\nrestrained from ceremony because\nthe church would not accept that the\nBible could apply to them, thus\ndenying them, by implication, the\nright to participate in the belief of\na christian god. There are also\naccusations from the opposite side,\nof secularism, of 'protesting too\nmuch', of promoting their special\nstatus as if distinct from society; the\nlist of accusation and counter-accusation is endless. It is no longer\nrelevant to ask how the church will\ndeal with this issue, as we have\nhistory to tell us of schism, pope\nand antipope, Torquemada, Jesus\nChrist, and so on. Orthodox meets\nRadical, vice versa, and gods get\nconfused. The book, the love, the\nhonesty and a silly pseudo-religious\nword like enlightenment. These are\nthe issues.\nThe book contains chapters\nconcerning a celebration of Coming\nOut, Partings, and the Death of\nFriends; most consist of Psalms,\nPassages, and Verse written by the\nauthor and other gay christians. I found literally several people\nwilling to talk about the issues; Tina\nthought the book was necessary,\nand was a needed affirmation of\nspiritual identity to those at whom\nthe book is aimed, although John\ndisputed that it would have any real\neffect on the church's approach to\nits gay followers. Andy responded\nin a similar fashion, with the\ncomment that gay ceremony is\nrecognized by neither the law or the\nGeneral Synod, and Gareth thought\nthere was no specific need for the\nbook, as relevant passages could be\nfound already in the Bible, and that\nthere were a number of cases of\nsympathetic priests performing\nceremonies for gay couples. Both\nRachel and David focused on the\nneed to bring attention to the public,\nas the church refused to\nacknowledge homosexual and\nlesbian relationships between\npracticing Christians. I might yet\nremark that the church may find\n'the Love that dare not speak its\nname' gaining its voice, and\ngathering its courage. When asked\nlater of Doctor David Jenkins'\nreference to 'Homophiles', and his\ncomments in the foreword\nregarding sexuality in a genital-specific sense, John said that a limited word such as 'homosexual'\ncould be responsible for much\nnegativity. 'Homophile', with its\nreference to emotional love, is a positive name; however, John\ndisagreed that gays had been denied\nlove and emotion as part of their\nnecessary vocabulary. Nearly\neveryone asked concurred\nregarding the limitations and\nnega t iv is m of the word\n'homosexual', and the need for new\nterminology.\nAlthough responses to\nquestioning were generally of a positive nature, John asserted that\npublic familiarity with the book\nwould reinforce and polaris e opinion, creating violent antipathies\nand equally violent sympathies. All\nagreed that their opinions would\nprobably not change, but become\nmore extreme in nature.\nI am a non-christian, non-gay\nsympathiser; I found this book\nmoving, intense and passionate.\nThis is by Rebecca Lewin, from\n'Partings'.\n'.. .I'm not ready to have lost her,\nand I can't say to the world,\nHelp me, I am divorced, I am\ndivorced!\nThey would not even believe we\nhad ever been married.'\nPage 9\n\n"

Consultations with the\nPresident of the Union and the\nUnion Manager have resulted in this\nchange being put forward and the\naction has been welcomed by the\nCollege's Student Welfare\nCommittee.\nThe Advice Office will main tin the existing opening hours and\nstudents are free to seek advice on\nany matter. Stefano Ruis, the Union\nAdviser, is a professional member\nof ICU's staff. He has considerable\nadvice work experience gained\nthor ugh his work in Citizens Advice\nBureaux and within a Law Centre.\nStudents (and staff) can approach\nhim for advice on any matter of\nconcern from legal rights,\nimmigration problems and debt to\nconsumer matters, taxation and\nlandlord and tenant disputes. The\nservice remains confidential at all\ntimes so no details about your\nconsultation will be divulged to any\nthird party without your express\npermission.\nStefano can be consulted either by\nphone or in person during his\nadvertised 'surgery' hours. No\nappointment is necessary but special\narrangements can be made where\nnecessary - just telephone\nbeforehand in order to discuss your\nneeds.\nNew Legal Advice Surgeries\nFollowing negotiations between the\nUnion Adviser and a local firm of\nsolicitors, the Union Advice Office\nis pleased to announce the start of\na new Legal Advice Surgery\navailable to all students and staff.\nFrom Monday 14th December\nvolunteer solicitors will be available\non a fortnightly basis to give free\nlegal advice during an evening\nsession. Consultations are by\nappointment only and these must be\nmade through the Union Adviser.\nStudents should first seek advice\nfrom the Union Adviser who may\nthen make an appointment for the\nlegal advice session where this\nwould be appropriate. The solicitors\ncan advise on a number of subjects\nand, where necessary, at their\ndiscretion, could undertake\nnegotiations on your behalf. The\nservice is only available through the\nUnion Advice Office so students\nseeking legal advice should consult\nStefano Ruis (the Union Adviser) in\nthe first instance.\nIMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nADVICE SERVICE\nOPENING HOURS\nfor personal callers\n(no appointment necessary)\ntelephone enquiries\n071-589 5111 ext\n3507\nam pm\nMon 11.00-1.00 2.00-6.30\nTue 10.30-1.00 2.00-5.00\nWed closed 2.00-5.00\nThu 10.30-1.30 2.00-5.00\nFri by appointment only\nMonday\nTues-Fri\n11.00-6.30\n10.30-5.30\nPage 6\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 952\nO pinion\n16 December 1992\nBeyond belief\nDear Jonty,\nThe Belief of Disbelief\nYour editorial on the 4th of\nDecember 1992, dealing with\nreligion in general, and Islam in\nparticular, was very interesting. I would like to, if I may, add to a few\nof the points you made.\nFirstly, what is a religion?\nBasically it is a set of beliefs that\ncompels the believing to think and\nact in a certain way. So the first\nthing to point out is that atheism i.e. the belief that there is no Creator,\nis also a religion. Now, the religion\nof Christianity for example, may\nlead one to pray and refrain from\nviolence. But what does the religion\nof atheism lead one to do? Because\nthe belief involves the disbelief in\na Creator and an afterlife, the\nathies t has one goal in life\u2014material\nbenefit\u2014be it to get money, women\nor satisfaction in his heart and mind\nby campaigning against social\ninjustices. It's all about getting as\nmuch contentment in this life, as is\npossible. Thus money is spent on\nperhaps, cigarettes, drinks, gigs,\nsports, politics, various action\ngroups etc. But surely it's all a waste if at the end of it all, you're\njust going to die. We should see the\nreligion of atheism for what it really\nis\u2014a waste of time and a grabber\nof money.\nYou asked the rhetorical question\nof how many wars were caused by\nreligion. In answering this let's consider the wars of the last century\n(in which, perhaps, more people\nhave died than in all the other wars\nin history put together). Was WW 1,\nin which 20 million Russian soldiers\nalone died, caused by your average\nreligion? Or was it about atheists\nseeking material benefit such as\npower and land? The same applies\nfor WW2 in which nuclear weapons\nwere first used and racial minorities\nwere systematically executed. And\nwhat of the wars in the world during\nthe past fifty years. Were they\ncaused by your average religion or\nby the propaganda and politics of\ntwo atheist superpowers, who were\nseeking material benefit i.e. power.\nAnd can all those wars in the Arab\nworld be said to be caused by Islam,\nChristianity and Judaism? Or can it\nbe said that they were caused by\ncapitalists, socialists, and military\ndictators (i.e. atheists) who are\npropped up by America and Russia\n(i.e. atheists)? The religion of\natheism has indeed caused a lot of\nbloodshed.\nAny religion, be it atheism,\nChristianity or whatever, has no\nmerit unless it's based on reality.\nThere's no point in living life\nbelieving in a Creator and the\nafterlife, if these are not reality.\nAnd there's no point living life\nbelieving there's no Creator or an\nafterlife if that is not the reality.\nWhich ever is the reality, we should\nact upon it\u2014even if that is\nsometimes difficult. The reality that\nyou need a degree to get a job that\nyou want, may not please you very\nmuch\u2014nevertheless, you'd still live\naccording to that reality and study\nfor three years to get that degree.\nSo what's the reality? The reality\nis that your calculator did not make\nitself\u2014it was created. The reality is\nthat you did not create yourself\u2014\nyou were created. Thus the reality\nis that the universe, which is a billion times more complex than the\ncalculator, you or whatever, was\nalso created. And remember, the\nreality is that we don't have to see\nthe making of the calculator and the\nmaker to know that he exists. Thus\nthe reality is that we don't need to\nsee the Creator and the creation of\nthe universe to know that it was\ncreated.\nI know that I can prove to anyone\nwho is open-minded that the\nCreator is a reality\u2014it exists, and\nI can also prove that the Quran is\nthe authentic word of that Creator.\nAs a result I try to live according\nto Islam. I invite you, and anyone\nto chat to practising muslims to\ndiscuss with us these realities of\nlife. Hopefully after doing so, you'll\nrealise that Islam has nothing to do\nwith insecurity, doubts or any of the\nother things mentioned in your\neditorial in Felix Issue 951.\nBilly Qureshi, Civ Eng 2.\nEvery question answered A nip on the heels\nDear Jonty,\nI was concerned to read C.A. France's letter 'Alarmed' in last\nweek's Felix and would like to\nrespond to the questions it raises,\nover the circumstances surrounding\nthe fire alert in the Union Building\non Friday 27th November.\n1. As the ICU Deputy President\nhas already reported, the incident\nhighlighted the inadequacy of the\nalarm bells in certain parts of the\nbuilding. Action has already been\ntaken to get necessary remedial\nworks underway. The building is\nbeing rewired this week and new\nalarm sounders will be installed and\ntested over the coming weekend.\n2. The door between the Union\nBar and Da Vinci's did not unlock\nautomatically, because the power\nsupply proved inadequate to operate\nthe integrated alarm and door lock system effectively under full\nevacuation conditions. We have\nsatisfied ourselves that this was a one off problem by its very nature\nand it has been dealt with already\nas a matter of extreme urgency.\nFurther improvements will be\nobtained as a result of the current\noverhaul of the alarm bell system.\n3. We had two security officers\non duty in Beit Quad at the time of\nthe incident and they were evidently\nable to establish quickly that there\nhad been a false alarm. It is not\nnormal for buildings to be directly\nlinked to the fire service.\n4. The College management is\nvery much aware of the need for the\nclosest possible attention to be paid\nto fire safety throughout the\nCollege. I can assure your\ncorrespondent and all your readers\nthat we are committed to ensuring\nthat all necessary safeguards are\ntaken. Indeed, we have increased\nour internal resources during this\nyear, through the appointment of a new Fire Office, in order to be able\nto respond more rapidly and\neffectively to the increasing\ndemands being made on us in this\narea.\nMay I take this opportunity to\nadd, in response to two other points\nwhich were raised in your 4th December issue, that the Fire\nOfficer, Graham Cox, has fire\ntraining for stewards in hand.\nFurthermore, regular checks are\nmade on fire extinguishers. If they\nare found to be empty, they are\nreplaced immediately. All too often,\nregrettably, extinguisher problems\nare caused by student high spirits,\nas was the case once again at the\nDisco party last Friday.\nYours sincerely,\nAngus Fraser.\nDear Jonty,\nAs you may know, I consider\nthose spineless individuals who\nchoose to write anonymously\nwithout good reason, to be beneath\ncontempt. These people do not\ndeserve to have their 'criticisms\nanswered. With regard to last\nweek's 'Beit Back' article, suffice\nit to say that the author is obviously\nas ignorant as (s) he is arrogant. Not\nonly was the article riddled with\ninaccuracies, it was clearly written\nby an individual who has not the\nslightest concept of the way\nImperial College Union and its\nsecurity operation is run.\nOn a similar subject I should like\nto answer this week's letter from CA France. Unfortunately the letter\nincludes numerous misquotations\nfrom my article in last week's Felix\nand so is limited in its validity. The\nreal howler is the misinterpretation\nof my statement (and I quote) 'The\nonly time the 'ma glock' doors are\nclosed while the building is in use,\nis during an event'. Perhaps Mr France would .like to crown his own\nstupid ty, or rather illiteracy!\nThe one constructive question\nasked by CA France was 'When?',\nreferring to the improvements to be\nmade to the Union fire alarm\nsystem. On Monday I was informed\nby College security that work on the\ninstall a ting of the new power supply\nunit will have begun by the time of\npublication. This power supply unit\nwill boost the sound produced by\nalarm bells in the building. If the\ninstallation is not already complete,\nit will be finished next week.\nI should like to point out that\nwhile I am responsible for security\nwithin the Union building, fire\nsafety for the whole college,\nincluding the Union, is undertaken\nby College security.\nAs to accusations of criminal\nnegligence on the part of Union\nmanagement, these are ridiculous,\nlet alone libellous. I cannot\nguarantee that in future nothing will\never go wrong in the Union\nbuilding, not that it will suddenly\nbecome a Utopian place where\neveryone can live in harmony and\npeace, whilst still indulging in their\npleasures and enjoying themselves.\nIf there is a deity out there who can\nbestow upon us such a status, please\ndo. While we are waiting, we mere\nmortals have to do our best to cope\nwith reality.\nRick Bilby,\nICU Deputy President.\nPage 5\n\n"

    "content": "'eat ure16 December 1992 Felix 952\nMinion Manages Mirror\nShock, Horror, Exclusive! Is Rupert Murdoch trying to take over what is\nleft of Fleet Street? Mimi Chakraborty looks into the reflecting glass of\nthe last Labour supporting tabloid.\n'Mirror Mirror on the wall, who\nowns the most newspapers of us\nall?' If David Montgomery\u2014new\nChief Executive of Mirror\nNewspapers\u2014were to ask that\nquestion while shaving one\nmorning, then it's likely that his\nmirror might reply 'Why Dave,\nyour old boss Rupert Murdoch, of\ncourse'.\nThis previous intimacy was not\nlost on Daily Mirror staff, who\nthreatened an all-out strike on\nhearing of Montgomery's appointment to the three-man\nexecutive team whose brief was to\nstreamline MG N into a saleable\nproperty after the chaos and\nconfusion left in the wake of Robert\nMaxwell's untimely death.\nMontgomery (43), whose\nfourteen years in newspapers\ninclude eleven working for Rupert\nMurdoch's News International, and\nwhose previous editorship s include\nToday and the News of the World,\nwas voted onto the board in a high\nlevel coup, without the prior\nconsultation of the Editor Richard\nStott, or any of his senior staff.\nFears that Montgomery would\nuse his executive powers to attack,\nrather than defend the Mirror's consistent support of the Labour\nParty and the Trade Unions, led\nstaff and journalists to vote to\nboycott any cooperation with\nMontgomery, and to cease\nproduction of the next day's edition.\nThere was widespread mistrust of\nMontgomery, particularly since he\nhad been instrumental in the breakup of the print unions in the bitter\ndispute which had resulted from\nMurdoch's decision to take News\nInternational to Wapping in 1986.\nStaff who had previously worked\nfor Montgomery at Today or The\nNews of the World, described him\nun flatteringly as a 'failed editor',\nwho was 'notoriously right-wing'.\nMontgomery as Editor of Today,\nhad, in 1989, urged Today readers\nto boycott sales of the Daily Mirror,\nbecause of its Northern Ireland\npolicy. In return, the Mirror's political editor Joe Haines described\nMontgomery as 'a liar, a hypocrite,\na bigot and a pornographer'. Such\nacrimony meant they were never\ngoing to be friends, and Haines\nsubsequently resigned on hearing of\nMontgomery's appointment.\nDaily Mirror staff refused to go\nback to work unless certain\nassurances were met by the\nexecutive, specifically that there\nwould be no redundancies and no\ncompromise on editorial policy.\nHowever, mutiny on the news\nroom floor came too late. A delegation of senior editors and staff\nsent to Sir Robert Clark, the\ntemporary chairman of MG N on\nbehalf of the banks, were not\npermitted to see him. Some three\nhours later, after a vote on the\nnewsroom floor to refuse\ncooperation had been carried by 238\nto 4 a further delegation was sent\nup again, only to be told that\nMontgomery was already on the\nboard. The executive vote was\ncarried by 3 to 2. It was left to\neditor Richard Stott to negotiate\nbetween the newsroom and the\nboardroom, shuttling to and fro\ntrying to secure an assurance that\nthe demands of the staff would be\nmet. Eventually some seven hours\nlater Stott secured a list of\nassurances from Montgomery, that\nthe staff were able to accept 'I have\ndefinitely got no plans for job cuts\nin editorial departments, nor has the\nboard considered any.. .the editorial\nindependence of our newspapers\nwill be preserved and vested in the\neditors...I will never sack an\neditor...the editors in all titles\nremain in their positions.'\nIt must have been quite a bit of\na puzzle then for MG N staff to\nwork out how, within a month of\nhis appointment Montgomery had\nfired Bill Hegarty, editor of sister\npaper The People, and a few days\nafter that, Richard Stott, the editor\nwho had been instrumental in\nbringing together staff and\nexecutive, was himself 'persuaded\nto resign'.\nMontgomery was not the only\none-time News International\nemployee to be appointed onto\nMGN's executive board. John\nAlwood was appointed finance\ndirector. Alwood had been manager\nof Murdoch's finances at his British\nNewspaper Operations, for a period\nduring the eighties before moving\nto Sky television. In fact there\nseemed to be a quiet one-man-went-to-mow style accumulation of ex-Murdoch place men insinuated into\nkey positions at MG N in order to\nbring about the October 27th executive 're-shuffle'. Perhaps\npredictably, both the incoming\neditors had served time at the Sun,\na fact cheerfully reported by Kelvin\nMcKenzie's gleeful leader, pointing\nout 'they used to work for US, so\nthey can't be loony lefties'. This\nmay have done little to cheer up\nMirror hacks concerned about their\npaper's political allegiance.\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, a certain paranoia might greet such a gathering of the clans of ex-Murdoch men. (Notably one 'ex'\nsince they started work at MGN).\nIt might be argued though, that this\ncould be wholly circumstantial.\nSuch is the monopoly of News\nInternational over British\nNewspapers that there are few\ntabloid journalists who can claim\nnever to have worked1 for Rupert\nMurdoch at all. It also should be\nstated that far from claiming to be\na Machiavellian style Prince of\nDarkness, Murdoch is just a man\nwho 'owns a lot of newspapers'.\nAnd why does he own them? T sell\nNewspapers to make money'.\nThat's fair enough, Rupe, no\nsurprises there.\nWhat is a surprise though, is that\nDavid Montgomery should be\nelected at all, and the questions\nwhich beg to be answered are by\nwhom, and for what purpose?\nThe weight behind the new\nappointments comes from the banks\nwho now own MG N. Specifically\nthe National Westminster bank and\nMorgan Grenfell who between\nthem control more than 56% of the\nstock. Having lent Robert Maxwell\nmoney for his various business\nschemes, the banks had taken shares\nas collateral. When, after his death,\nMGN's finances collapsed the\nbanks seized the shares and became\nMGN's owners. They appointed\nJohn Talbot of Arthur Andersen to\nadmins tr it ive MGN's affairs.\nTalbot's chief brief was to\nstreamline MG N and to cut away\nmuch of the profligate spending\nwhich had characterised Maxwell's reign. His challenge was to cut\ncosts, get the share price up and\nbecome more commer ical. The\nbanks went to sell their shares in\nMG N, but not too soon at too low\na price. The decision to install a new team at the helm sends a clear\nsignal that the group will not be\nage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n16 December 1992 Felix 952\nMoney, Money, Money...\nThe Finance Society is a relatively\nnew and growing society at\nImperial College and exists for\nthose of you who want to increase\nyour grasp of the key concepts,\nissues and terminology used in the\nworld of finance, business and\ninvestment.\nThe Society's main objective is to\nfind as many stimulating ways of\ndoing this as possible. Since the\nlaunch of the Society we have gone\nfrom 0 to 370 members in a mere\ntwo years. Even if this does appear\nto overheat our fledgling clerical\napparatus and create the odd spot of\nchaos at times, we have still\nmanaged to become arguably the\nlargest and fastest growing society\nat IC. We want the society to be\nalive and evolving and so we would\nlike plenty of feedback from\nmembers about possible events.\nDuring the course of this term we\nhave maintained an average of just\nover one event per week held on\nvarious topics ranging from\naccountancy to merchant banking\nand we do boast an average\nattendance of ninety people per\nevent.\nDespite our achievements we are\nnot sitting on our laurels, as we feel\nthere are a great many budding\nfinancial genii who have not joined\nour society, so get moving, now!\nWe're not here to preach and\nconvert you from engineers and\nscientists to grossly overpaid\nfinancial wizards, our objective is\nsimple, it is to educate you, the\nstudent community of IC, about the\nworld of finance.\nEarlier I mentioned the large\nvariety of events we have held this\nterm, you may ask 'What events?'.\nWell those of you who are members\nwould have regularly received the\nSociety newsletter which listed the\nevents of the next few weeks in\nadvance. Anyway, coming back to\nthe point, the events kicked off with\nthe free cheese and wine party\nwhich was attended by over 150\npeople (bunch of boozers!) as well\nas the very successful presentation\nby Andersen Consulting on\nManagement Consultancy, it too\nwas widely attended and let me say\nthat the free buffet (at a cost of \u00a3 6\na head) had, absolutely nothing to do\nwith it. The most interesting event\nof the term was (especially for you\njob seekers) the Inverview Skills\nWorkshop by Sharon Hewes from\nTouche Ross which was repeated\n(due to popular demand) and\nattracted a total of one hundred and\nWinesoc\nThe Macallan 'War of the Noses'\nUniversity Malt Taster Competition\ntook place at IC on Wednesday 2rid November. The event was hosted\nby ICU's own Wine Tasting Society\nand featured four teams of expert\n(!) 'nose rs', from the universities of\nBath, Bristol, Cambridge and, of\ncourse, us here at Imperial!\nA highly informative slide show\nserved as a warm up before the\nactual nosing took place. The task\nwas to correctly guess, sorry,\nrecognise the region and actual\ndistillery of five anonymous malt\nwhiskies (there are only four\nregions but over 100 distilleries).\nThis having been accomplished\n(quite a long process of sniffing\nsipping the whiskies\u2014well, you had\nto have another taste just to make\nsure!), Macallan then offered a few\n'wee drams' of their product to help\nus relax, before subjecting us to a distinctly dod gy animated video of\nthe Macallan process. After this\n(and some more drams of the\nmalt!), we completed the Team\nChallenge quiz, on all aspects of the\nwhisky industry, and the awaited\nthe results\u2014with the help of some\nmore Macallan, of course!\nBath won the Team challenge,\nand the prize of a case of Macallan\nten year old, but the real star of the\nday was Imperial's Martin Pocock,\nwho correctly named all five\nregions and three of the distilleries\nand goes on to the National Final\nin London early next year! This\nperformance was particularly\nimpressive given that the runner-up,\nCambridge's Wine Soc President,\nwon this heat last year and then\nwent on to come runner-up in the\nfinal.\nIn the end a good time was had\nby all, generous quantities of\nwhisky disappeared and we all look\nforward to next year, when we at\nImperial shall have our revenge\u2014\nand that case of whisky!\nRemember ICU Wine Tasting\nSociety meets every Tuesday at\n6pm in the Union Building all next\nterm, membership is not necessary\nand a tasting will cost about \u00a3 4 .\nWatch out for details of\nforthcoming tasting s on posters and\nin Felix. See you there!\nfifty of you. The workshop focused\non common follies made and gave\nan insight into the evil mind of the\ninterviewer. Future events\nscheduled for next term include a visit to the Dealing floor at B ZW and an Insight into the Stock\nExchange by a prominent\nrepresentative of the London\nExchange and many others.\n'What else?', you may ask, well\nfor the literate amongst you, we\nhave produced a magazine\n'Capital'. This was distributed at\nthe Freshers' Fair. The magazine\ncontains articles about many crucial\naspects of finance, written at an\nintroductory but non-trivial level.\nFor those of you who have a copy,\nI'm sure it provided many\nstimulating hours of reading,\nhowever if you missed the first issue\nwe expect the launch of the second\nissue on the first day of the spring\nterm. To complement Capital, we\nhave also set up a College-wide\nsubscription service for the\nFinancial Times. The service is\navailable only through the Finance\nSociety which has access to heavily\ndiscounted copies of the FT at 12pa day (a fifth of the publisher's price). These will be available to all\nsubscribers at the Union bookshop\nas of the beginning of next term.\nInterested? For further details drop\nLucille Ankrah (Maths II) a note via\nthe pigeonholes or speak to anyone\non the committee.\nFinally for those of you who\nfancy being part of this society and\nenjoy teamwork and meeting people\nfrom a variety of business\nenvironments, maybe you should\nthen consider joining the committee\nin the coming elections to be held\non February 16th1993. Otherwise\ncome along anyway to elect the\ncommittee of your choice.\nP.S. Look out for our pension\nfund scheme set up with the aid of\nour financial adviser Robert\nMaxwell, before he went for a swim.\nSalman Ali.\nBoard club\nFor our second weekend away, we\nhad decided to venture a little\nfurther. Approximately 755.3kms( there and back) to the sheep\ninfested countryside of Gower in\nWales.\nThe trip started well when nine\npeople turned up ready to go instead\nof the expected eight. It made the\ntrip cheaper, and less comfortable\nin the back of the van, I am reliably\ninformed. The six hour journey was\nuneventful apart from a roof rack\nstrap breaking and Alaric losing to\nRob at 'Bash and Crab'\u2014serious\nbrain damage.\nThe other half of our group\narrived before us and nicked the\nbest chalet and all the local 50p's \u2014\nwho needs electricity? They did\nhowever bring beer, a Sega\nMegadrive, a video and videos\n(about sacra f icing Mars Bars to the\nWind God\u2014weird!). After a quick\nround of 'Worm against Human'\nwe went to bed ready for Saturday's big winds.\nThere was no wind, not even\nenough to disperse a fart. Undetered\nwe hit the beach in true 'Home &\nAway' style with our surf boards.\nSurf's up dude! But none of us\nmanaged to do it standing up! Later\nthe wind picked up and so we raced\nthe land surfers. The old boys\neventually thrashed us. That\nevening whilst Fat Bastard Alaric\ncooked dinner it got wi nnnn dy. Dan\nwas fanta s ising about his Alto and\n4.4m sq rig. Everyone agreed an\nearly night would be a good idea,\nfortunately you don't always do the\nsensible thing.\nAgain there was NO wind, but\nwe still went to the beach and\nwaited and waited, for the promised\ngales. Everyone had a good sail and\nthe small waves provided an\nunusual challenge for most. Half an\nhour before we were due to leave\nthe wind arrived. Alex and myself\nhad an excellent sail whilst\neveryone else loaded the van\u2014\nthank you.\nAn hour later we met Rob who\nhad sneaked away for a night of\npassion, decent food and constant\nelectricity, but he did lend us his\nstereo. It was another superb\nweekend and we are all sorry Julia\ncouldn't make it\u2014we really missed\nher!!!! Thanks again for driving,\nDaniel\u2014I'm really sorry 'you\nmissed the six foot waves and force\nsix wind at the other beach, I guess\nyou made up for it last Wednesday!\nIf you would like to learn the way\nof the wind surfer meet us Tuesdays\nat 1pm in Southside Upper lounge.\nPage 14\n\n"

However, I find myself\nbecoming increasingly frustrated by\nthe stupid slogans inserted between\npeople's first and surnames when\nmentioned in articles. So come on\nall your sports scribes out there;\nstop being wan kers and stick to the\nfacts.\nYours,\nDave (becoming increasingly\nfrustrated by the stupid slogans\ninserted between people *s first and\nsurnames) Buckle.\nDear Jonty,\nI'm quite sure that your editorial\non 'Religion' will receive several\nreplies\u2014some may even bear out\nwhat you wrote by losing their\ntemper!\nEven recent history shows that\nthe damage caused by misguided\nreligion can be significant. Less\nobvious, perhaps, are some of the\npositive roles that the traditional\nchurches fulfil. Leaving aside the\nquestion of whether belief is\nunfounded, the counselling,\ncommunity and charitable activities\nof religious institutions are\nworthwhile in their own right.\nParticularly in difficult economic\ntimes, many people find themselves\nisolated, depressed and desperate.\nAny religious minister will tell you\nthat much of his (or her) time is\nspent supporting and advising these\npeople. The luxury of faith, which\nmany here at Imperial find difficult\nto accept, affords at least some hope\nin a world that may seem very\nun welcoming. The disadvantages stem from the\ntransition from religious fer v our, or\nany form of extremism, to violence.\nIt seems unreasonable to lay this\nsolely at the door of any Church.\nIn most cases the label of religion\nis added to an essentially cultural or\nhistoric disturbance.\nI doubt very much that the IRA\nare fighting for the benefit of\nRoman Catholicism. If they were\nthey might listen to Pope John Paul\nII and cease their pointless terrorist\ncampaign.\nPerhaps our conclusion should be\nto remind religious societies and\ninstitutions that they should pay\nmore attention to their own\nconsciences and creeds. It is\ndifficult to understand any religious\nbody that achieves its aims by\nharming or offending others.\nYours sincerely,\nGeoff Maxwell, Elec Eng 2,\nVice President, CathSoc.\nIsn'the a little old for all this? Dear Jonty,\nIt is with a twinge of regret that\nI feel the need to write to you\nregarding the 'Beit Back' column,\nFelix issue 951. Initially I would\nlike to say that this correspondence\nis not something designed to ring\nfence my ego, but more an\ninterpretation of facts and how it\nmay be possible to move forward\ninto the future with a positive\nperspective rather than a negative\none.\nQuoting 'Beit Back' you say\n' . . . Ye Olde Johnny Griffiths\n(32)'\u2014in fact I am 31, Date of Birth\n20 May 1962.\nMoving on from such pedantic s, Mr Back states '...what Jonathan\ndid last year\u2014as far as security\ngoes, absolutely nothing'. Then,\nhalfway through the last paragraph,\nand I quote again 'A year ago there\nwas a vast change in Union\nSecurity', (something which, as\nDeputy President, was one of my\nmany areas of responsibility).\n'When card checking was\nintroduced, and the then Duty\nOfficers, started working in\ngroups...'\nSurely a blatant contradiction? I did absolutely nothing last year\nregarding security, as well as\nimplementing a vast change! Okay,\nself esteem dealt with, let us now\nlook at security itself. The only\nreason we need security staff is\nbecause a certain area is insecure.\nWe have fire alarms installed in the\nUnion Building to inform its\noccupants to get out a.s.a.p. because of a fire, but it can also be\nused to deter the mugger, rapist, etc\nfrom carrying out their evil deeds.\nFrom my experience last year as\nDeputy President, went off on a few\noccasions, but for only two reasons.\nFirstly, as a test ot make sure all the\ncircuits, and evacuation procedures\nwere in order, and secondly because\nof wanton vandalism.\nBecause of the Union Card\nchecks now in place, and one year\nold, this means that only members\nof Imperial College Union, their\nbone-fide quests, and members of\nother student unions who have\nreciprocal membership with ICU\nare users of the Union Building on\nWednesday and Friday nights. In\nessence, it turns out that the vast\nmajority of users of Wednesdays\nand Fridays are undergraduates at\nIC. So when we have a false alarm\nof the nature witnessed in the early\nhours of Saturday 28th November,\nit is relatively safe to assume that\nA.N. Other from Department X( immaturely) attempted to empty\nthe Union Building, spoiling a perfectly good night for the other\nstressed out students who just\nwanted to relax and have a bit of\nfun.\nThe moral of the story? Criticise\nthe sabbatical in charge of security?\nYes, but criticise constructively and\nfind out why, r or instance, the\nalarm's couldn't be heard, or why\nthe mag locks did not open. Armed\nwith the answers to these questions\nit is then time to analyse the\ninfrastructure of, how it could be,\nand why the Union Building has not\nbeen altered. After all, the Students'\nUnion only receives a small\nsub vent ion from College every year\nand then ICU has to make choices\non how to spend this money. And\ndon't forget, YOU the students\ndirect the Union on how to spend\nits sub vent ion by the various student\ncommittees. The sabbaticals cannot\njust decide on, say, Friday to invest\n\u00a310,000 (or \u00a310 for that matter) and\nthen start spending on the following\nMonday. The Union has to find this\nmoney from somewhere within its\nlimited budget, and only if you, the\nstudents, approve. Would you like\nyour society's budget halved, or do\nwithout the \u00a38000 to help purchase\nthe Print Unit's coll at or? In all\nhonesty, I think not. You must also\nremember that ultimately Imperial\nCollege are the controllers of the\nUnion Building and any change\nwithin must be authorised,\ninvestigated and sometimes over-managed by them. So, you may\nbad-mouth Rick Bilby but he can\nonly operate as efficiently as the\nresources available to him allow.\nWith this in mind, I suggest you\nread 'The Official Version', page\n5 of Issue 951 and I think a constructive conclusion is that Rick\nis doing the best he can given the\nresources available to him. He has\norganised a new power supply at no\nmonetary cost to you the student.\nFinally, think about the term\n'Resources Available'. Resources\nare not just cash balances, bricks\nand mortar etc, but they also include\nthe students of ICU. Just as cash\nbalances can be classified as\nAlone voice Dear Sir,\nAs I anticipated in my letter of\n28th November, the college\nmanagement have mostly in gored the potentially fatal matter of\ninadequate fire alarms and locked\nfire doors at the Union on Friday\n27th November.\nThe only attempt to acknowledge\nthis, came from the Union Deputy\nPresident (Felix 4th December).\nWhat a pathetic article that was! He\nwrites that the evacuation took\nlonger than was hoped; fifteen\nminutes! One quarter of one hour!\nIn less than one third of that time,\nfire can engulf a room, such as Da\nVinci's for example.\nHe writes that alarm bells are not\naudible in some parts of the\nbuilding; should that not have read,\npositive or negative, the student (?)\nwho set off the alarm is without\ndoubt a negative resource to the\nUnion and in turn a negative asset\nto his/her fellow students who were\nadversely affected by the culprit's aforementioned immature acts.\nDoes Rick, your elected\nrepresentative deserve what he got?\nNo, certainly not. In fact, all the\ncriticism should have been directed\nat the person who set off the alarm.\nThis type of individual is spoiling,\nand will continue to spoil an\nenvironment especially designed for\nstudents to enjoy themselves. So\nnext time why not denote your copy\nin a way which is intended to punish\nthe instigator of such crimes, while\nyou constructively criticise the\nsabbaticals, and the manner in\nwhich they allocate the scarce\nresources available to them.\nMerry Christmas,\n3 B( SrimtifB (31)\nMaths with Management 3.\n'...in any busy, well populated\narea...'? He also says that he has\nbeen assured of improvements as\nsoon as possible; NOT GOOD ENOUGH!! When?\nHowever, the crowning stupidity\nin this article is when he writes that\nthe fire exits are only kept locked\nshut when the building is in use.\nPARDON?\nThe aforementioned article shows\njust how negligent is the attitude of\nmanagement when it comes to fire\nsafety. I just hope that I am one of\nthe lucky ones who escapes a fatal\nincident and is able to testify to the\n'Criminal Negligence' of College\nand Union Management.\nYours faithfully,\nCA France, Civ Eng 2.\nPage 4\n\n"

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College\n1 Li JJ 1 il Issue95216 December 1992\nAdvisor advised Garden's Blaze\nby Declan Curry\nStefano Ruis, Imperial College\nUnion Adviser, is seeking legal\nadvice on payments to Imperial\nCollege Day Nursery. A spokesman\nfor the Attorney General's office\ntold Felix that they had received a letter from the Union asking for\npermission to seek advice. This was\ngranted as a general request, and the\nspokesman commended the 'good\npractice of union officers writing in'\nif there was a possible problem.\nICU funding to the Day Nursery,\nin Prince's Gardens, was stopped\nover two years ago. At that time,\nsabbatical officers decided that\npayments to the nursery did not give\na direct educational benefit to\nstudents, and so were ultra vire s( out of rules, illegal). A legal\nopinion sought by Felix in May this\nyear said that the payment provided\nfor a service of educational benefit,\nand so was permissible. This\ninterpretation has been confirmed\nfor Felix by the Attorney General's office. The spokesman said\nyesterday that the Treasury Solicitor\nwas 'pretty relaxed about these\npayments', as such donations 'were\nrelated to the provision of services\nfor students as students'. He added\nthat day care facilities were\nregarded as 'beneficial to studies'.\nLibrary Petition\nby Gareth Light\nAsst News Ed\nThe first section of a petition calling\nfor longer Library opening hours\nhas been given to the Rector. The\n10 page, 154 signature, document\ncalls for the hours of the Lyon\nPlayfair Library to be changed to\nan opening time of 9am and a closing time of 10pm. This is a1 hour extension on the current\n9.30am9.30 pm opening time, with\n5.30pm closing during vacation\ntime. The petition asks for the new\nhours to apply on Sunday and\nduring vacations.\nThe petition has been organised\nby Dr Conrad Lichtenstein, of the\nCentre for Biotechnology. Dr\nLichtenstein tells the Rector that\nother copies of the petition are in\ncirculation, but the current petition\nis being sent so that a response can\nbe made before Christmas. The\ndocument says that opinions were\n'very strong in support of an\nextension to the opening hours', and\nthat 'many people were\ninconvenienced by the early closing\nin the College vacations'. The\nproposed new hours would cater for\nresearch workers, postgraduates\nand undergraduates working\nthrough the holidays.\nDr Lichtenstein says that an\nextension to the opening hours will\nrequire an increase in salary costs,\nand suggests that a significant\nincrease in costs could be avoided\nby using security staff to man the\nlibrary during the extended hours.\nDr Lichtenstein adds that this means\nthe usual library support services\nwill not be available in the new\nopening periods, but that staff and\nstudents 'would be grateful just to\nuse the library even if unable to take\nbooks out then'.\nThe scene out side Gardens Hall\nNews Staff\nA 'chip pan fire' in Garden Hall\nwas extinguished by the London\nFire Brigade on Monday night. The\nfire started in a third floor kitchen\nin the Prince's Gardens' hall, when\nthe pan was left heating on the\ncooker. The oil was being used for\nan 18th birthday fondue party, and\nthe girl said that she left the pan\nheating for about five or ten\nminutes.\nFire alarms went off in the Hall\nat 7.52pm, and security guards\nfrom the Prince's Gardens'\nSouthside lodge were called. The\nsub-warden put the fire out with a carbon dioxide extinguisher, but it\nre-ignited as the window was open.\nAttempts to extinguish the fire a second time failed, and the kitchen\nfilled with smoke. The sub warden\nevacuated the kitchen, and closed\nthe door.\nThe hall had evacuated as all fire\non Monday\nalarms were audible and the\n(magnetically locked fire doors\nopened. The fire brigade were\ncalled by security at 8.00pm, and\nthey arrived at the scene at 8.04pm, after which the fire was put out.\nSpeaking at the scene, Angus\nFraser, College Managing Director,\npraised the fire service for their\n. 'prompt intervention'.\nThe Gardens fire followed earlier\nfires or fire alerts in Southwell Hall\nand the Union Building, when fire\nalarms were inaudible. Nicky Fox,\nImperial College Union Housing\nOfficer, said she was 'extremely\nworried' by the failure of fire\nalarms in Robert Pryor House. The\nCollege is continuing with its rolling\nupgrading of fire safety systems on\nCollege grounds. Weeks Hall will\nbe first to be upgraded, followed by\nLinstead and Southside. Houses in\nEvelyn Gardens will be the last to\nbe upgraded.\n3 / 4 / 5\nLetters\nBonanza\n1 1\nPray\nfor Gays\n1 2 / 1 3\nMirror\nMonopoly\nPullout Xtra Xmas\nXtravaganza\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nFelix 952 16 December 1 992\nopen to predatory bids in the short-term, and will not be properly\nsaleable for about a year. This\neffectively scuppers prospective\nbids made by Conrad Black and MJ Heinz who had expressed\na quis it ive interest in MG N shortly\nafter Robert Maxwell's death.\nNotably absent from the\nspeculators at this time was News\nInternational. Rupert Murdoch had\nspent a year between December\n1990 and 1991 clawing his way\nback from the brink of bankruptcy,\nfacing debts of up to $8.1 billion.\nThe threat of any of up to 146\ndifferent creditors foreclosing on\nhis loans and forcing him to pay up\nthreatened the absolute collapse and\nsubsequent liquidation of his News\nInternational Empire.\nWhen Robert Maxwell's death\nwas announced in November 1991\nMurdoch had just secured the safety\nof his lines of credit, raised the $1.5\nbillion necessary to prevent a full\nscale buy-out and had successfully\nmerged his massively loss making\nSky satellite transmission network\nwith its rival British Satellite\nBroadcasting, and was using the\nprofits from his newspaper sales to\noffset BSkyB's losses, and\nbeginning to show an overall profit.\nHowever, a series of terrifying\nclimb-back's from over the edge\nhad left News Corps in a still\ndelicate state, not ready to consider\nfurther a quis it ion. By 1993, however, this state of\naffairs might certainly have\nchanged. Were News, say, to\nconsider buying MG N in a year's time, they would be elegantly\npoised to do so, convenience d further by substantive 'interior\ndecorating' carried out courtesy of\nMessrs Montgomery, Banks,\nAlwood et al.\nIt is disturbingly characteristic of\nNews International to force\nexecutive and editorial\nappointments which are directly\ncontrary to the papers tone and\nstyle, and the choice of the staff\nthemselves. It has been a feature of\neach of the editorship s of Murdoch\nflagship papers The Sun, The Times\nand The Sunday Times. When in\n1986 Murdoch moved the printing\npresses out to his newly constructed\nwalled-in, barbed wired, union-proof fortress Wapping', journalists\nwere given the ultima tiu m 'cross the\npicket line or be fired'. Those who\ndid not comply were shown no\nmercy, and others left of their own\naccord because they could not\ntolerate such shabby treatment.\nFrom the Sunday Times alone,\nnearly a third of its journalists left,\nwere fired, or resigned.\nIt is not wholly implausible to\nsuggest that perhaps MG N is being\nsculpted specifically for a Murdoch/Montgomery a quis it ion, perhaps sometime in the next year,\nand it would be hard to question that\nthere would have to be a prearrangement with the banks on this\naccount, and that that would be the\nmost reasonable explanation for\ntheir appointing Montgomery in the\nface of such strenuous opposition.\nIf this is indeed the case, then where\ndoes it leave the identity of the\nMirror\"? If Rupert Murdoch\nbecomes an owner of MG N will the\nnewspapers be able to remain\nunchanged?\nEven before it is a political organ,\na newspaper is a commercial one,\nand The MGN's papers are no\nexception. The Daily Mirror and\nthe Sun are the two fiercest\ncompetitors in the tabloid\ncirculation wars, and differ mainly\nin their opposite political ideologies.\nThe people who buy the Mirror do\nso because they seek a Labour party\nsupporter, and a paper with a left-wing bias. No executive whatever\nits own philosophy would risk\nchanging a paper so much that it lost\nits customer appeal. It's unlikely\nthat MG N newspapers would cease\nto be vocal supporters of the Labour\nParty through the next election.\nWhat may be a result though is that\nbecause the executive has pruned\naway, not just the editorship, but\nother leader writers too, they won't encourage new writers to be as\nincisive as their predecessors were,\nthat in becoming more commercial\nand saleable they will become\nlightweight.\nMGN's unique character lies in\nthe fact that they have consistently\nset a different political agenda from\nthat of a range of Tory tabloids.\nMixed up with the Soap & Royals\nstories, they have been responsible\nfor aggressive investigative stories,\nunpopular with the government of\nthe time, notably pursuing the cases\nof the Guildford Four and the\nBirmingham Six at a time when\nthey were not picked up by other\npapers. It is just this kind of story\nthat might find itself a casualty of\na new management, whose token\nsupport of the Mirror's traditional\nstance sadly fails to look beyond the\nledger and who's own political\nagenda is quite different.\nIt is too early to say exactly who\nwill come to own Mirror Group\nNewspapers, but the line of\ndominoes has been arranged to\ntemptingly to lead to Murdoch and\nMontgomery, that is the time ever\ncomes, all it will take is one little\npush.\nPage 13\n\n"

Get this; it's time to get\nyour ears sheared off.\nPeb & the Diamante Devil\n\u2022 Out on December 29th on\nFood/ EMI, from the album\n'Perverse', out January 25th. Jesus\nJones will be touring in March.\nFrank & Walters\u2014\nAfter All\nEP5! EP6! The Frank and Walters\nrelease a double CD set just too late\nfor buying for your Dad for\nChristmas. What bastards. It would\nhave made a lovely Christmas\npresent. Both CDs feature 'After\nAH', remixed from the album, a lovely Franksome lovesong. I love\nit. It's marvellous. Also on CD1 are\n'The Day Before The World\nEnded', 'The Turquoise Gardens',\na very strange song, and a live\nversion of the old favourite\n'Michael'. Indeed. But the real\ntreats lie on CD2. Oh Yes they do.\nThe Franks run through studio\nversions of all their live covers,\n'Love Is In The Air', that old\nchestnut, in a completely Ballroom\nfree style, 'I'm A Believer', from\n'Ruby Trax', and 'Funky Cold\nMedina'. Behind you. What's more, you can confuse your record\nshop by ordering one or the other\nas they've both got the same\ncatalogue number: HOO CD4. What fun. What jolly japes. What\nfurther ex use do you need to buy it?\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Out on December 29, on\nSetanta/Go! Discs. The Frank &\nWalters support Carter at Brixton\non December 21.\nSuzanne Vega\n\u2014 Blood Makes Noise\nHas 'industrial clanging' all the way\nthrough, the equivalent of the north,\nbut presumably Pittsburgh-type\nthing (\u2014sad to hear of Factory's demise).\nStrangely mysterious, but typical\nVega ramblings, actually I don't understand the relevance of any of\nthe lyrics. It claims 'Tom's Diner'\non the flipside, but is actually\n'Neighbourhood Girls'\u2014get it\nright!\nIt leaves me relatively apathetic,\nbut it's cool and I like it.\nLucas.\n\u2022 Out now on A&M. David Gray-Birds Without\nWings\nWho? Slap it on and have a listen\nanyway!\nSo I did, wow! Urban folk music.\nNice to see the art form isn't dead,\nbut as an exponent, David Gray is\nmerely competent. He's got a good\nvoice, and three good songs, but to\nshine in this style you require a real\nspark. Unfortunately, he's not good\nenough to stand out.\nBilly Bragg or Bob Dylan he's not, but certainly worth a listen if\nthis is your thing.\nGlyph\nJesus Jones say 'You don't want to meet us down a dark alley way.\nBMX Bandits-Serious Drugs\nThe BMX Bandits are Scottish.\nThey know Teenage Fanclub. Live,\nthey even cover their 'Kylie's Got\nA Crush On Us'. On this e.p., they\ncover Primal Scream's 'Don't Fight\nIt, Feel It', complete with a massive\narray of sampled crowd noises. The\nchorus of the title track goes 'Get\nsome serious drugs' (no possibility\nof claiming that's about a geezer\nwho they met at a club, is there?).\nGuess the label? Yes, it's that\ndarling of the indie scene, Creation,\nand the BMX Bandits are a typical\nCreation band, which makes this\nrecord a fine exponent of the genre,\nand also makes it a totally\nunsuitable Christmas present for\nGrandmothers.\nLise Yates\nOut now on Creation/Sony\nBivouac\u2014Slack\nJohn Peel fave s, Bivouac sound as\nthough they come from Seattle. In\nfact they're a three-piece from\nDerby. Comparisons with the Nband are perhaps inevitable and\nyeah, admittedly they da sound a bit\nlike Nirvana but who gives a fuck\nwhen they make records as good as\nthis. 'Slack', title song is as to rmer. Amish mash of moods that\nculminates in a mind-blowing\nclimax. 'Towald' is like the calm\nafter the storm, a thoughtful and\nme lac holi c affair. Whilst 'Two\nSticks' returns to the moods\nexplored on 'Slack'. This is one\nfuck of a cool record\u2014rush out and\nbuy it now!\nLeo.\n\u2022 On Elemental Records.\nThe House of Love-Crush Me\nNot new material this (recorded\nabout a year ago, actually), so an\nunusual release. 'Crush Me' is\nfairly quiet: Guy Chadwick\nmoaning again, about his girlfriend,\nof course. It's a quality track, but\nnot of fantastic attention grabbing\nvalue.\n'Into The Tunnel', on the\nflipside, is totally outstanding.\nCombining the best aspects of the\nband to produce something dark and\ntortured that we haven't seen from\nthem for a while. I was stunned by\nit, frankly. I'm glad they've finally\ngot a grip; let's hope this means\nthey've stopped mutating into\nAirhead (They're Shit-ed).\nGlyph\n\u2022 Out now on Fontana/Polygram.\nAvailable in numerous varied\nformats.\nFreaky Realistic\u2014Something\nNew/Cosmic Love Vibes\nI had it on 45 instead of 33 and it\nsounded like badly produced\ntechno...\nRealising my stupid mistake, it\nwasn't as good as I thought it would\nbe, those piano breaks I 've heard a zillion times before, and the feel\nsucks. Unforgivable. The flipside is\nmore accommodating and more\nvibrant, but there could've been\nmore funky bass and less of the\nlove, peace and harmony stuff, the\nsinging is sub-standard, but the\nbrief rapping is right on, man.\nWhen I first read about them, I liked their overall concept of\n'Frealism': '...either being too\nfreaky or too realistic, and without\nbringing the two together you just\ndon't get anywhere.', in fact they\ngo nowhere, possibly only to the\nouter reaches of oblivion. It's a shame 'cos I appreciate the\nphilosophy and was convinced I'd like it.\nI should've left it on 45, that way\nit would've ended quicker.\nLucas.\n\u2022 Out now.\nAlice in Chains\u2014World\nThis is an average song, one that\nyou might start singing to yourself\nas you think about what she said the\nother time whilst walking along\nSouth Kensington subway. It has an\nodd combination of an Ozzy\nOsbourne type vocalist singing a sweet dear melody over a thunderous bass line and drum\nrhythm. When played loud such a noise can be quite effective although\ngenerally Alice in Chains are just\nanother Seattle grunge band with\nlittle originality at all.\nRalph.\n\u2022 Out in January, on Columbia.\nage 6\n\n"

All the\ncast are perfect for the roles,\nespecially the dame, played by Alan\nFord. Unlike some dames who can\nbe patronising or too stupid to be\nlaughed at, this one had got it just\nright. Other impeccable characters\ninclude the bad die Abenazer (boo,\nhis sss s s), played by Michael\nBertenshaw and of course, Aladdin\nhimself, played by the excellent\nnew-comer Benjamin Fellows.\nIf cast don't take your breath\naway with their performances\n(although I don't see how this is\npossible), then the set will.

Tickets \u00a34-\u00a310.\nRomeo And Juliet\nI don't believe that there can be\nanyone reading who doesn't know\nthis classic story: Boy meets girl,\nthey fall in love, their love is\nforbidden, they don't care, they\nwould rather die than live without\neach other, they both die. Okay,\nmaybe I'm trivia lising. But what\never you feel about the story of\nRomeo and Juliet becomes\nirrelevant when treated such a performance.\nThe first scene begins with\nRomeo trying to declare his love for\nanother, much to the amusement of\nhis friends. You could be forgiven\nfor thinking that this ballet was\ngoing to be a comedy, lively and\nfast moving. This makes the closing\nact all that more poignant as all the\ndespair, love and sorrow are\nenacted so beautifully by the cast.\nI don't think anyone could call me\na romantic, but I have to confess\nthat even I was close to tears when\nJuliet finally fell dying upon\nRomeo's already lifeless body.\nThe sets and costumes were well\nthought out and impressive, the\ndancing, superb. The score by\nProkofiev is well suited and\ncontains a few pieces familar\npieces. A thoroughly enjoyable and\nwell recommended evening.\nAladdin\nFiddler on the Roof\nWhat a refreshing change from the\nusual Grease/West Side\nStory/Oliver round of college\nproductions UCL DramSoc\nprovided last week. Fiddler, the\nstory of a new generation defying\nthe traditions entrenched in a tiny\nJewish village around the turn of the\ncentury, is a challenging and\nambitious project. The music is\ncomplex, moods and scenes shift\nand change linked by a haunting,\ncontemplative narrative. Cast, crew\nand orchestra succeeded in\npresenting a wonderful evening's theatre. A very talented company\nwas led by the gorgeous Martyn\nGilbey 'debuting' in the central role\nof Papa Tevye. The part is not an\neasy one, often alone on the stage.\nHe holds the plot together with his\ntouching musings and tin pot\nphilosophies and is lumped with the\nshow's most famous and difficult\nsong 'If I Were a Rich Man'.\nGilbey seemed totally at home and\ncompletely convincing as the\npuzzled Papa shambling, shifting\nand capitulating whilst brimming\nover with love in his halting simple\nspeech, he had the audience en rapt. Every role was perfectly cast\u2014\nfrom Alex Hayion's gawky taylor,\nBobbie Chatt's fire y Hodel (with an\nenchanting voice) to Frances\nWedgewood's intimidating Mama\nGolde. Whatever the scene; a wedding, shabbat, an argument, a dream, the grind, the joy, the pathos\nand the courage of the villagers\nshine through. The well drilled\norchestra provided sensitive\naccompaniment to some excellent\nsinging and neat, energetic dancing.\nChoreography was original and\ncarefully detailed wi h out being over\ncomplicated and messy.\nBasically I was very impressed by\nan amateur production that was\neasily as good as, and better than\nmuch of what I have seen in the\nWest End this year. Well done.\nSara.\n\u2022 Sadler's Wells, Rosebury Ave,\nEC1, Angel tube. Box Office\n071-278 8916.

Consquently is\nfired, so she and her chums go up\nthe road to another theatre and act\nhappily ever after...This nail-biting\nscenario(?) is swathed in a script of\nthe worst 'hand-to-forehead-you-must-be-my-long-lost-sister'\nvariety. Against such odds, the\ncuriosity value of the star-stud dec i cast is an essential diversion.\nMs Brightman generously brings\nher 'Christine' to those of us who\ncouldn't get tickets round the\ncorner. Every line shrieked, eye is 'gods'-wards, arms outstretch ea, each sentence heavy with\nimpending song (this injects a modicum of tension as the audience\nstay alert, earplugs at the ready).\nAesthetic relief from this\northodontic nightmare is abundant.\nEvery swag gable item is swagged,\neach drape able, draped often in\nsome novel tartan, not least Ms\nBonham Carter. Sumptuously clad\nthroughout, her flawless beauty is\nbreathtaking. Her acting is not.

    "content": "Reviews\n16 December 1992\nGreat Flying Stories edited\nby Fredrick Forsyth\nThis is a collection of short stories\nabout, yes, you guessed it, flying.\nThe cover of the book is somewhat\ndeceptive, with 'Frederick Forsyth'\nin very big letters and 'edited by'in\nvery small letters. Initially I thought\nthat the stories were all by him, and\nthis would have put me off had I seen it in a shop (no disrespect to\nForsyth and his writing, but I would\nnot want a book full of his short\nstories). On looking inside, I found\nthe other authors included Roald\nDahl, HG Wells, Edgar Allan Poe\nand Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nWith this range of styles, there is\nbound to be one or two that you will\nenjoy. My particular favourite was\n'Cat' by Richard Bach, who is very\nkeen on flying and owns his own\nplane. His other novels and short\nstories have been connected with\nflying in some way or another.\nI think that an interest in aircraft\nand aviation helps in the enjoyment\nof this collection, though none of\nthe stories go into the technicalities\nof flying. I doubt that all the stories\nFelix952 will appeal, but there is probably\nsomething for everyone and at\n\u00a34.99 it is very reason al by priced.\nBland\n\u2022 Published by Corgi\n\u00a3 4 . 9 9\nKissing the Gunner's Daughter Ruth Rendell\nHaving only seen the television\nversions of Ruth Rendell's previous\nInspector Wexford stories, reading\none of her novels was not as good\nas I expected. Ordinarily I enjoy\nreading mystery and suspense\nstories, but this was not, as the\nreviews on the back promised,\n'brilliant'.\nThe story begins with the murder\nof a detective during a bank\nrobbery, and then moves to a series\nof deaths at a country estate ten\nmonths later. Wexford investigates\nthe later murders and thinks that\nthere is a link with the murder of\nthe detective. Rendell adds a family\ntouch with Wexford's fondness for\na17 year old girl who is the sole\nsurvivor of the second series of\nmurders.\nAnother comment on the back of\nthe book is that 'there is not one\nsuperfluous word'. This is my only\nreal criticism of the style of writing\n-1 found that descriptive nature of\nthe story made it very difficult to\nget into the plot. I prefer the story\nto move quickly rather than have a GET STUFFED\ncompetition\nif you want to get your\nfavourite meals on to TV,\nthen send your recipes to:\nNUS Ents\nBox 119\n461 Holloway Road\nLondon IM7 6LJ20 Runners-up receive a free\ncopy of the book. Entries\nshould be in by 15th Jan 1993\nat the latest\nfew paragraphs describing the\nscenery.\nBasically, I would suggest that\nyou watch the televised version than\nread the book, but as it was shown\na couple of weeks ago, you won't be able to until the repeats, probably\nlate next year.\nBland\n\u2022 Published by Arrow Books\n\u00a38.99\nWitches Abroad\nby Terry Pratchett\nOnce upon a time, in a place called\nthe Ramtops (on the Discworld)\nthere were three witches. Well,\nthere were four but one passed on\nleaving Granny Weatherwax,\nNanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. As\nit turned out, the youngest and most\nnaive witch (I mean who heard of\na witch needing to learn martial\narts), was to become a good fairy\ngodmother. Unfortunately for she\nwas to become involved in stories\nand fairy tales (a very powerful\nform of magic as it turns out)\ntravelling to foreign parts of the\nDiscworld, in order to create happy\nendings for these stories. Luckily\nfor her Granny and Nanny went\nalong to help. But remember not all\nendings are happy.\nWell, the story involves wands,\npumpkins, voodoo, \"head ology\", dwarves, pirates, cats and virtually\nevery fairy tale and story that is ever\nworth telling. How these stories are\ninterwoven is a touch of genius on\nTerry Pratchett's side and his sense\nof humour and wit is, once again,\nsuperb. This book gave me a new\ninsight into stories I thought I knew\noff by heart and I thoroughly\nenjoyed reading it.\nI suggest you add this experience\nto your life. For those of you that\nbelieve you're probably too mature\nto read about fairy tales, witches\nand magic, then I suggest you\nregress a little and try to enjoy\nyourselves as well.\nGB H \u2022 Published by Corgi, price\n\u00a33.99\nSEX Page 18\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nReplies to letters\nThis week, Rick Bilby (ICU\nDeputy President) writes a letter\ncontaining aggressive attacks on CA\nFrance, in a letter he has had\npublished this week. A peculiar\nevent, which I feel requires some\nexplanation on my part.\nLast week, Rick came down to\nFelix saying that he wished to write\na letter and would I mind if it was\na bit late? In the ensuing discussion,\nI told Rick that another letter by CA France had been submitted on the\nsubject of fire alarms. Obviously\nRick was interested, and I let him\nsee the letter. In retrospect, this was\nmore than a little unusual and I regret doing it. Rick wrote his\nabrasive letter as a response to what\nCA France had to say.\nHere is a tiny note of editorial\npolicy. From now on, if a letter is\nsubmitted for an issue of Felix, no\none but Felix staff'will see it until\nthe copy is printed and distributed.\nI apologise for this single lapse of\nfair play on my part and it will not\nhappen again.

With an\nICU president whose ways of\ndealing with criticism are, at best,\ndoubtful, but at least more subtle\nthan his predecessor, we need\nstudents who voice their objections\nto the way they are treated. After\na slight hiccup, Felix will continue\nto be the best forum for the\nexpression of all opinions at\nImperial.\nStatement of Intent\nThe most grief I get is caused by\nstudents who want to see their own\narticles printed and are upset\nbecause their piece didn't get in.\nIndulge me please with a little word\nof explanation.

Dear Jonty,\nAs part of our regular weekly sale\nof 'Socialist Worker' the members\nof IC Socialist Worker Student\nSociety (ICSWSS) held an ad-hoc\nreferendum in the ICR, the purpose\nof which was to stimulate debate\nand interest in the question posed.\nThe voters were given the free\nchoice between two responses: T support the abolition of the\nmonarchy and the founding of a republic' or 'I support the\ncontinuation of the monarchy'.\nIt is, of course, impossible to\ndraw any firm conclusions from\nsuch a quickly arranged and lighthearted vote, in fact, the number of\nvotes cast was also too small to\npermit any concrete analysis; (and\nbefore you say 'oh yeah, they're\nonly saying that because everybody\nshowed their support for the\nQueen'; in fact the small number of\nvotes cast were overwhelmingly in\nfavour of abolition) however, from\nthe many interesting conversations\nwe had in the ICR, it was obvious\nto us that the abolition issue is at last\na reality.\nOne would say that the response\nwas only due to the renewed\ntopical it y of the Royal Family. That\nis true enough. However, it is\nencouraging from our point of view\nto see the question of abolition\nbeing seriously discussed on\nbreakfast television and even more\nencouraging to see that the Queen\nwill at last pay tax on her vast\nfortune (given to her by the\nmiss us taxpayers of this country), even\nthough I doubt it will be backdated.\nIt is also a breath of fresh air to\nsee the people finally getting fed up\nwith the constant bailing out of the\nmonarchy. Finally the lunacy of the\nsystem was made apparent: Sixty\nmillion pounds for an old lady with\nno fire insurance from a government (who get their revenue\noff the working people of this\ncountry) who tell us there is nc\nmoney for schools, hospitals, new\njob creation or unemployment\nbenefit.\nFor the price of damage to the\nhouse of a grandmother with five or\nsix 'little houses' think what we\ncould do for the hundreds of\nthousands with no roof at all over\ntheir heads, Windsor is a great\nbuilding, the Queen might be a nice\nperson (I wouldn't know as I 've\nnever met her). It's nothing\npersonal.\nI wonder if the Union would\nconsider a proper referendum on\nthe monarchy, just for interest's sake\u2014we'd be more than willing to\nco-operate, as I'm sure would the\nIC ConSoc who would just love to\nsee us filthy Bolsheviks stuffed.\nMost of all, let's debate. We're\nall rational human beings. Tell me\nhow we should spend the \u00a360M the\nQueen will get for Windsor. Maybe\nwe could put it towards paying the\n\u00a31 billion it will cost to close the\ncoal mines...\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Salter, ICSWSS\nNemesis Dear Jonty,\nThe Hellenic Society would like\nto protest against the provocation of\nthe Turkish Society during the\nOverseas Week. The Turkish maps\nshowing the Greek islands of\nRhodes and the Dodecanese as well\nas the occupied part of the\nindependent Republic of Cyprus\nwithout indication that they were\npart of independent countries were\nsure to provoke the anger and\nbitterness of Greeks and GreekCypriots alike. The Turkish society\nnot only destroyed the spirit of the\nevent\u2014which was the exhibition of\nculture, civilisation and life of the\ncountries concerned\u2014but also\ndeliberately insulted us and\nprovoked trouble by refusing to take\ndown the offensive material, when\nordered to do so by Union officials.\nThe Turkish Society knew what our\nreaction would be and therefore is\nthe sole responsible for the\ndisruption of the event.\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to Imperial\nCollege Radio. I am, without doubt,\nmystified as to the reason why my\nreception of this service in my\nresidence is so poor. I am a resident\nin Weeks Hall, which is the North\nside of Prince's Gardens. My\nreceiving apparatus is of a quality\nwhich can pick up most\ntransmissions.\nI am of the knowledge that these\ntypes of broadcasting units have\nusually a restricted range, but surely\nThis act is part of the generalised\nTurkish propaganda which has\ntriple aim: firstly, to justify the\nat tro cities committed 18 years ago\nin Cyprus; secondly, to perpetuate\nthe occupation and division of the\nisland of Cyprus, which is\ncondemned by the United Nations,\nthe Council of Europe and the\nBritish and Commonwealth\ngovernments; thirdly, to promote\nterritorial claims against Greece,\nwhich could lead to war. It is\nunacceptable to us that Imperial\nCollege which has such a large\nGreek community should be the\nstage for this kind of propaganda.\nWe therefore demand an apology\nfrom the Turkish Society in writing\nand we really hope that these\nprovocations will stop taking place\nin our College.\nThe Hellenic Society,\nThe Vice President\nChristas Dallis.\nWeeks Hall should be within this\nrange.\nTherefore I would like to enquire\nto other readers, whether their\nservice is affected in a similar way\nand if so I would like to raise the\nquestion, is a service that has such\na limited broadcast ability able to\nperform the task of reaching its\ntarget audience\u2014students of\nImperial College?\nYours sincerely,\nMatthew Daniel Solomon, EEL\nHard of listening Page 3\n\n"

RAG Raids\nnear and far, crazy events, parties,\ncompetitions. The list is endless.\nHow do we manage to bring you so\nmuch fun. Well, just in case you're\nworried that we may have run out\nof ideas, let me put your minds at\nrest. Next term will be even bigger.\nYou want to know why? Well read\non then silly.\nNext term is RAG Week term.\n'Wot's that then?' I hear you cry.\nWell, it's basically the craziest,\nwackiest week of term and there is\nno way what so ever to avoid it\n(other than visiting your great aunt\nin Siberia). It runs from January\n29th to February 6th and every day\nthere is at least one crazy thing\ngoing on. Just to whet your a petite, we have here a copy of the timetable\nfor RAG week, cunningly leaked by\nme.\nWe will also be running the usual\nservices (Hit Squad, Killer, Grim\nReaping etc.) so if you fancy getting\ninvolved pop up and see us in the\nRAG Office in the union Building.\nYou maybe wondering what a few\nof these events are so, to clarify\nmatters, here are a few definitions.\nRAG Carnival is along the same\nlines as an Ents party with live\nbands and a bar extension. Also\nplanned is Bar Fly jumping etc. so\nwatch out for that. RAG Rugby is\na new event suggested by the Ladies\nRugby team. They have challenged\nthe RSM firsts team to a match but,\nRAG WEEK JANUARY\n29th RAG Carnival Evening\nUnion Building.\n30th RAG Raid All Day\nSomewhere Far\n31st RAG Rugby\nFive legged pub crawl\nEvening\nFEBRUARY\n1st Mines Dirty Disco\nEvening, Union Building.\n2nd Slave Auction\nLunchtime, Mech Eng\nFilm Evening\nEvening, Concert Hall\n3rd Beer Festival\nAll day, JCR\n4th Hypnosis\nEvening, Great Hall\n5th The Great RAG Bash\nEvening, Union Building.\n6th Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump\nMorning, Somewhere Near\nParachute Ok, so we have had a bungee jump\nso lets now go a little higher up and\ntake a slower descent. Next term\nyou can Parachute jump for\nMultiple Sclerosis. Now is the best\ntime to pick up your sponsorship\nforms so you can con your relatives\ninto giving you some do sh over\nChristmas. This way you can raise\nloads of money and do the jump for\nfree. A deposit of \u00a380 will be\nneeded after Christmas but with all\nthose relatives it will be easy to\nraise \u00a3130 to do it Free (most of our\nBungee jumpers raised over \u00a3100)\nThe usual rag incentives will\napply so if you haven't yet done\nanything with Rag you can get an\nexclusive Mug at \u00a350, a designer TShirt at \u00a3150 and a sweatshirt at\n\u00a3300. If lots of you do a jump we\nwill be able to bring the cost down.\nCome up to the RAG Office on the\neast staircase of the Union or to a RAG meeting to pick up a sponsor\nfrom. You can also collect forms\nfor the Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump or any other zany\nideas you have for RAG Week.\nto even things up, the men are going\nto play in well ies and suspenders!\nMines Dirty Disco is similar to\nRocky Horror but taking things a bit\nfurther. Basically, the less you\nwear, the less you pay!\nThe last event of RAG Week has to\nbe given a special mention because\nif you want to take part, you need\nto get a sponsor form soon. Don't be put off by the title because it's not as bad as it sounds. The jump\nis only two feet out of the back of\na minibus. However, the minibus is\nparked outside Harrods, you have\nnothing on other than a pair of\nparachute boots and a harness and\nthen you have to run back to the\nUnion. If any of you are feeling a little apprehensive about joining us\nin this, let me add that at least two\nladies are taking part and some of\nus intend to walk back!\nFor those of you who enjoyed\nGuild's Hit Squad then you can take\npart again during RAG Week. Also\navailable from the RCS will be\n'Pint-o Grams', 'Handcuff-o Grams', Gnoming and Grim\nReaping, great ways to pamper\nyourself, get yourself and a fan ci able partner chained together\nfor the day (or night) and to\nembarrass your friends and\nlecturers.\nIf you have any ideas for silly\nsponsorship events (like shaving all\nbody hair) or if you just want to get\ninvolved more come to Rag\nmeetings every Friday in the Ents\nLounge at 1.10pm or go to your\nCCU Office for their events.\nBe Mad!\nBe Silly!\nBe Part\nof it!\nRAG CARNIVAL\n* Storming Party*\n*Live Bands*\n29th Jan\nUnion Building\nAll proceeds to RAG\n\n"
