    "content": "The weird world of Wes Anderson\nChelsea Manning talks orgasms and tributes one of Hollywood\u2019s most talented and underrated directors\nI find it a damn shame that more\npeople are not aware of the fabulous director/producer/film writer\nWes Anderson. I first fell in love\nWes Anderson\u2019s films when I saw\nthe movie Rushmore starring Jason Schwartzman. The surreal\natmosphere and outlandish plot\njust blew my mind. I thought, \u2018No\nway can a director follow up such a\nprimo production.\u2019 Then I saw The\nRoyal Tenenbaums... I cried tears\nof joy, but they might have just been\ntears of not blinking for two straight\nhours. Either way, the protein in\nthose tears was held together with\nbonds of pure amazement. After\nThe Royal Tenenbaums I thought,\n\u2018No way can Wes pull off such brilliant and colorful characters again.\u2019\nI practically had an orgasm in my\nseat when I saw The Life Aquatic\nWith Steve Zissou.\nFor those of you who are unaware\nof the masterpieces created by Wes\nAnderson, I will now proceed to\ngive you my very biased, slightly\ntribute-esque analysis of this talented man\u2019s films. You should probably read my description with the\nskepticism of someone listening\nto a mother speak about the supreme talent of her bratty blob of\nprocreation.\nWes Anderson has a core group of\ncast that he uses in most of his films,\nconsisting of Bill Murray, Owen and\nLuke Wilson, Anjelica Huston, and\nGene Hackman, all wonderful actors whose combined talent can be\narticulated by the expression \u221e\u221e.\nThe usual Anderson protagonist\nis very clever, yet plagued by depression and awkward quirks and\ncharacter flaws. His characters are\nchock full of dry humor and elitism.\nI find The Life Aquatic With Steve\nZissou Wes Anderson\u2019s most daring\nand impressive piece to date. It\u2019s\nfilmed in the style of a documentary\nfollowing the Zissou Society, a sailing crew that, whilst clad in matching baby blue track suits, produces\ndocumentaries about their voyages\nand experiences with aquatic wild-life. Steve Zissou makes it a mission to find the Leopard Shark (an\nanimal fabricated by Anderson\nthat is essentially a big ass shark\nwith leopard patterned skin) that\nkilled his best friend. In a way, the\nmovie is basically a massive homage to Jacque-Yves Cousteau, right\ndown to the ridiculous knitted red\nbeanies.\nWes Anderson films simply have\nelements I\u2019ve never seen in any other film \u2013 he captures an absolutely\nnovel style on screen. His movies\nare filled with vibrant, almost car-toon-like colors that are painted all\nover the costumes and scenery. The\nrefreshingly quiet dialogue is punctuated by loud, fuck off Devo, Iggy\nand the Stooges, and David Bowie\nsongs. The films are such a change\nfrom the current shit films that\ncapitalize on loud, flashy stunts,\nand special effects. And I\u2019m sure a\nlot of Imperial students could relate\nto the exceedingly intelligent, but\nsocially inept and dorky characters.\nJust kidding.

The building project has suffered numerous\nsetbacks and delays; during the\nsummer break, asbestos was discovered in the core, and a lack of\nplans for the building (due to its\nage) which lead to workmen cutting\nwater pipes, causing flooding.\nThe lift, the centrepiece of the\ncore redevelopment, is to be delivered by March.\nThe core is now mostly complete,\nwith contractors applying a few finishing touches to the building. A minor drama erupted last week when\nthe sabbs discovered the new doors\nordered for the entrance to Union\nReception and the Union Dining\nHall were about an inch too large\nand would not close properly. The\ndoors have since been replaced.\nThe opening of the core completes\nthe first phase of the Beit redevel-opment. The next phase involves\nthe splitting of the Union Gym into\ntwo levels; the upper level will become the Student Activities Centre,\nand the lower level of the gym will\nbe enlarged.\nThe shiny new entrance and furniture in the bar seem to have had\nno effect on the penchant of drinkers to vandalise the toilets in the\nbuilding. After the Superbowl event\nlast week, the men\u2019s toilets behind\nthe Union bar suffered damage, and\nfurther punishment had caused the\ncubicles to fall over completely.\nThe toilets had not been repaired,\nand on Thursday morning after\nSports Night in the Union, the toilets had been almost completely\ndestroyed. Cubicles were ripped\nup, fittings were damaged, and the\nfloor was covered with urine, beer,\nfood and vomit.\nIt is not clear whether those responsible for the vandalism are Imperial students, or from elsewhere.\nMain entrance to the Union re-opens after more than six months\nof work \u2013 but vandalism continues in the building\n\u201cNaughty vending\nmachines\u201d shock\nEmily Lines\nEditor-in-toilet\nNew vending machines have arrived in the Union, and have caused\na bit of a stir with the normally conservative College population.\nThe machines are made by\nNaughtyVend, and feature items\nsuch as vibrating cock rings (there\u2019s\na phrase I never thought I\u2019d see\nin a news article \u2013 Ed.), flashing\nnipples, handcuffs and inflatable\nsheep.\nIn the interests of research, Felix\npurchased a number of these items,\nbut was unable to claim them on\nexpenses as the machine refused\nto provide the author with a VAT\nreceipt.\nThe sheep seems to be anatomically correct in almost all respects,\nincluding an orifice to the rear for\npurposes unknown.\nSurprisingly, no complaints have\nbeen received by the Union yet,\nthough the machines have only\nbeen in place for a week. Eyebrows\nwere raised in the Beit offices at\nthe \u201cBlowdom\u201d cannabis condom.\nThe machines are in both the ladies\nand mens facilities; according to\nthe NaughtyVend website, the male\nproducts outsell the female ones almost four-to-one.\nThe disproportionate ratio of the\nsexes at the College is unlikely to\nbuck this trend.\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-sheep\nTop: the newly-opened Union core, complete with fetching blue\ncolour.

    "content": "Plotting in a modern Rome\nThe classic tale of a power struggle set to Handel\u2019s impressive score opens at the ENO\n19\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAgrippina\nEnglish National Opera\nUntil March 1\nFrom \u00a315\nSarah Connolly as the schemeing Agrippina\nHandel\u2019s Agrippina tells a familiar\ntale of corruption and deceit in the\nupper echelons of Roman society.\nWhen the emperor Claudius apparently drowns at sea, his ambitious\nand well-connected widow Agrippina schemes and manoeuvres her\nson Neronene, born from a previous marriage, into position to claim\npower. But when it is revealed that\nClaudius has been saved and is returning to Rome, the title character\u2019s best laid plans and ambitions\nare revealed for all to see and her\nresolve put to the test.\nIn David McVicar\u2019s production,\noriginally debuting in Brussels,\nthe tale is adapted to contemporary Britannia. It works well \u2013 the\ngames of power are now played out\nbetween corrupt politicians and officials in tailored suits, corporate\nvampires, and pseudo-WAGs vying\nfor their spot at the trough of indignity and fame.\nThe snapshot works well and influences from modern Britain are\nevident in the Enfieldesque brat\nNerone and the beautiful Poppea, a\ncrucial cornerstone in Agrippina\u2019s\nplans, who veers between Bridget\nJones and a Boujis debutante.\nIt all makes it readily accessible\nto the novice, and though the show\nweighs in at just under four hours,\nit never becomes tiresome, throwing up laughs, entertaining and ab-Hannibal Rising\nThomas Harris\nsorbing in equal measure.\nThe vocal performances are, on\nthe whole, dazzling. Though the\nshow has been criticised as being\na vehicle for the feted Sarah Connolly as the show\u2019s main character,\nthere is admirable depth across\nthe board. Connolly\u2019s Agrippina is\ncharismatic and wilful, and technically faultless.\nAs her son Nerone, Christine Rice\nsteals the show with a spine-tingling\nvocal performance matched by her\nsimilarly show-stealing cocaine-fuelled antics. But the real find was\nENO main stage first-timer Lucy\nCrowe as the pawn-turned-player\nPoppea \u2013 the audience\u2019s concentration was palpable every time she\ngraced the stage with her unrestrained vocal power.\nAnd not least, Daniel Reuss\ncontrolled the music admirably\nfrom the pit; Handel\u2019s electrifying\nscore was both mesmerising and\nelevating.\nThe script was sparkling and\nbright. Though crassly comical, it\nretained the essence and spirit of\nthe original while receiving a welcome infusion of profanity more in\nline with the rest of the production.\nIt wasn\u2019t subtle \u2013 but it was fun and\nthe show flowed easily between its\nvarious scenes and arias.\nBy striking the right balance between retaining traditional operatic\nintegrity and embracing modernity,\nMcVicar opens his arms to both au-diences. Opera has never been so\naccessible.\nDavid Paw\nENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA AND CLIVE BARDA\nHannibal Lecter\u2019s \u2018Memory Palace\u2019\nis the starting point for Thomas\nHarris\u2019s new novel Hannibal Rising. If you\u2019ve read any of the other\nbooks or seen the films, you\u2019ll be familiar with this concept, but here it\nis tired. Harris uses it to introduce\nyou to Hannibal the genius with a\nmuseum-like mind. Unfortunately,\nthis hackneyed beginning doesn\u2019t\nfade away; it only gets worse.\nWe first find little Lecter living in\na castle in Lithuania with his sister,\nnoble parents, and tutor to see to\nhis genius. It is the early 1930\u2019s and\ngreat flapping metaphors about\nblack swans of doom and his innocent sister abound. The Nazis are\ncoming, and the Russians, and in\nthe increasingly short chapters we\nare constantly reminded that they\nare, surprisingly, the bad guys.\nThe events of WWII carry the\nLecters away from their castle and\ninto hiding in the woods, there\u2019s lots\nof suffering caused by the baddies\n(Nazis), and a rather hurried conclusion where all of Lecter\u2019s family\nare killed \u2013 his sister in a gruesome\ncase of cannibalism: this is the part\nwhere you feel sorry for Lecter.\nAs fate would have it, the war\nends and our little orphan Lecter is\nlooked after in a Russian communist orphanage which, ironically, is\nsituated in the castle that belongs\nto him. Luckily noble painter Uncle Lecter comes to his rescue and\nsweeps him away to his chateau in\nFrance and to meet his mysterious\nJapanese aunt.\nThis introduction to Hannibal\u2019s\nteenage years is where I really began to dread reading more of the\nbook. Auntie Murasaki is the sum of\nevery Japanese cliche; icily beauti-ful, a whiz at haikus, and owner of\nterribly sharp swords. Yawn. Some\nrevenge ensues when the uncle\nfalls ill and Hannibal has to avenge\nhis Aunt\u2019s honour. Things get a little\nout of hand with the revenge, and\nHannibal becomes known to your\nstandard lone maverick policeman,\nInspector Popil. Yawn again. So,\nhim and Aunt move to Paris, where\nHannibal (he\u2019s a genius again) is\ntraining as a doctor.\nThe quiet life is not suited to Hannibal, however, as he\u2019s suddenly obsessed by elaborate revenge on the\nmen who destroyed his childhood.\nFrom here, it\u2019s all downhill. There\u2019s\nnone of the suspense of the earlier\nbooks and none of the interplay between Hannibal and his victims. We\ncan\u2019t sympathise with the crudely\ndrawn victims because they\u2019re evil\nex-Nazis and we can\u2019t sympathise\nwith Hannibal any more because\nhe\u2019s so cartoon-creepy.\nIf you\u2019re coming to Hannibal Rising having never seen any of the\nfilms or read the other books in the\nHannibal Lecter series, then you\nmight possibly enjoy some of the\ndrama, but even for pure trashy\nnovel enjoyment, there\u2019s not a\nlot to recommend. It\u2019s fairly obvious that Hannibal Lecter is now\npurely a cash cow for the author.\nPerhaps the film version suits the\ndumbing down of such a magnificent murderer more aptly, but I\u2019d\nrecommend giving both a miss and\nwatching The Silence of the Lambs\ninstead for a taste of what Hannibal\nthe cannibal is really about.\nMargaret Stewart\nBook\nReview\nIf Imperial made Arts Festivals ...\nThere\u2019s been something in the air\nthis week. It smells sweeter, sounds\nmore melodic, and everything looks\nthat little bit brighter. Yes, it\u2019s that\ntime of year again: ArtsFest week.\nFor all the first-years amongst\nyou, this is the week that Imperial\u2019s\nextensive collection of A&E (Arts\nand Ents) clubs showcase their talents and prove to us all that being\na scientist and having artistic/mu-sical talent are not mutually exclusive personality traits.\nArtsFest has been more prominent on campus this year than any\nother this reporter can recall; you\ncan hardly have failed to hear the\nbusking in SAF, Tanaka, and Sherfield, featuring some of Imperial\u2019s\nchoral and instrumental elite.\nArt has been well-covered too,\nwith PhotoSoc and LeoSoc exhibitions in the Blyth Gallery (that\u2019s\nSherfield Level 5), plus a retrospective of Imperial\u2019s artistic past in the\nMechEng Foyer.\nIt\u2019s not all been about showing off\ntalent. Workshops on Wednesday allowed students wanting to try their\nhands at drama, art, and dance.\nBut if you have missed seeing\nsome of what\u2019s been on offer, don\u2019t\ndespair (well, as long as you\u2019re\nreading this on Friday!) The Finale\nConcert is at 7:30 p.m. tonight in the\nGreat Hall, promising all the best\nfrom the week, including dancing,\nmusical performances, and mar-tial-arts demonstrations.\nEmily Lines\nREBECCA WARREN\n\n"

Since\nthe average gamer\nspends their hours in the guises\nof World War 2 sergeants, alien-fighting nuclear scientists, and\nTiger Woods, it\u2019s fair to say that\nall gamers do is roleplay. But\nso-called Roleplaying Games\nhave set themselves apart as\na genre over the years, now\ncondensed into one main idea\n\u2013 character improvement.\nOver the years, however, it\u2019s\nalso been about getting to know\nyour character, and putting a\nlittle something in the game.\nThis week we look at the Eastern tradition of fantasy slash-em-ups with a retrospective\nglance to the Zelda and Final\nFantasy series, in preparation\nfor Final Fantasy XII\u2019s launch.\nJapanese RPGs \u2013 Japanese\ngaming in general \u2013 often has\nthe stereotype of being long, in-volving, and essentially simple.\nIt\u2019s certainly a recipe that\u2019s\ndone Squaresoft well over the\nyears. But that\u2019s not to say that\nWestern RPGs are any shal-lower, or more challenging. The\nElder Scrolls series, as well as\nthe Baldur\u2019s Gate franchise on\nPC as well as console, might\nrepresent a culturally different kind of roleplaying, but the\ncore elements remain the same\n\u2013 big story, small idea.\nRPG remains \u2013 and may always remain \u2013 one of the geekier corners of gaming. And given that gaming itself is a little\nnook of life filled with cobwebs,\ngeeks, and copies of Freespace\n2, that\u2019s quite an achievement.\nBut as the numbers slowly shift\nto behind the scenes, and the\nstory becomes something the\nplayer\u2019s involved in as much as\nthe designer is, there may be a\nchange in that.\nIf you\u2019re looking to pick up a\ncopy of Final Fantasy XII fresh\non launch day, HMV at Oxford\nCircus have organised a special launch event at lunchtime\non Friday 23rd to celebrate\nthe launch of the game.

The answer\u2019s not what you might expect\n\u2013 it\u2019s none of them.\nWith the XBox now firmly in its\ngrave, obituary written in the annals of gaming history, the last-gen\nmight seem to be somewhat over.\nBut sales of Playstation2s are still\non the up, bolstering Sony\u2019s user-base, and the Nintendo DS Lite - released almost a year ago in Japanis still sold out in its home country.\nPlaystation2 owners are looking\nforward to God of War 2 and Final\nFantasy XII, and huge sales of DS\nLites means more conversion and\ndevelopment for the novel handheld\nconsole \u2013 with prices significantly\nlower, even than a Wii, it\u2019s not just\nthe latest technology that\u2019s making\nthe big sales. With the Playstation3\nstill struggling \u2013 a key developer at\nEA recently advised people to steer\naway from Sony\u2019s latest console\n\u2013 it\u2019s possible that the Playstation2\nmay stay in production for some\ntime.\nIn the land of the PC, things are\nfar rosier. Vista users are slowly\ncalming down as they discover\nwhich games work \u2013 though at the\ntime of Felix going to press, Second Life, an internet-phenomenon\nMMO with more than a million active users and a trade of around $1.2\nmillion per day, completely refuses\nto work under the new operating\nsystem.\nBut single-player gaming is smil-ing, and so was Will Wright as he\ngave an address at the DICE summit on the challenges around developing his latest creation, Spore.\nWright performed his usual trick\nof being unimaginably intellectual,\nand discussed how the structure of\nintricate games like Spore have to\nbe broken down to communicate\nwith the player in as simple a way\nas possible. The game, which has\nhigh hopes set on it by a lot of gam-Spore blossoms, EVE falls, and the old days prevail. And teh Console Warz, I guess\nGears Of War nabbed eight awards at DICE\u2019s AIAS ceremony, including Best Game and Console Shooter\ners, is due to be released within a\nfew months.\nAstheBurningCrusadeisreduced\nto the smouldering news headlines\nthat WoW players are used to, the\nbig news in MMOs this week came\nfrom EVE Online, the space sim on\na huge scale. When EVE hits the\ngaming news, it\u2019s either because\nthe developers are making an an-nouncement, or because someone\u2019s\nbeen betrayed. This time? Both.\n\u201cI\u2019m here so this whole issue --which jeopardized my company and\nour community -- can be put behind\nus\u201d were the words used to open a\nconfession by EVE developer \u201cCCP\nt20\u201d, who admitted to illicitly supplying highly powerful blueprints\n\u2013 information that can be used to\nmanufacture powerful weaponry,\nships, and equipment \u2013 to some of\nthe largest Corporations in the EVE\nuniverse.\nUnlike Second Life, EVE\u2019s players don\u2019t make much money from\ntheir investment. But EVE saps\ntime unlike any other MMO, and betrayal in such an involved universe\n\u2013 in particular, from the people that\nnurtured the community in the first\nplace \u2013 was hard to swallow for a lot\nof the dedicated players.\n$1200\n\u201cBounty\u201d promised by SCEA\nPresident for each Playstation3\nfound on shop shelves.\n11\nNumber found by the staff of\nonline comic Penny Arcade,\nwithin a half hour of their offices.\nCOW41087.DEVIANTART.COM\n\n"

    "content": "Nukes: deterrent or legacy?\nParliament will vote this March on\nwhether or not to renew the UK\u2019s\nsubmarine based nuclear weapons\nsystem \u2013 Trident. A paper submitted by Tony Blair proposes that the\nsystem, originally commissioned\nby former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1980, should be replaced at a cost of around \u00a350 bil-lion. To remain as one of the world\u2019s\nnuclear powers, Britain would have\nto replace these weapons before\n2019 when they will otherwise start\nto deteriorate.\nBlair\u2019s proposal, which initially\ncalled for the replacement of all\n192 nuclear missiles has now been\nmodified and suggests replacing\n160 of them and possibly reducing\nthe number of submarines employed in the system from four to\nthree. Blair has emphasised \u201cuncertainties\u201d for the future of the\ncountry, he has admitted that it is\nunlikely that a country such as Iran\nor North Korea would attempt to attack Britain but said that this is not\nimpossible.\nThe government have been criticised for possibly breaching article\nVI of the nuclear non-proliferation\ntreaty which calls for members to\ndisarm when possible. However\nJack Straw has stated that \u201conly a\nsimpleton\u201d would see Trident as violating the treaty. It is also a hugely\nexpensive project, it will protect 500\njobs at Rolls Royce including those\nof the scientists and engineers involved but could also drain money\naway from public services such as\nthe NHS.\nDuring the cold war, nuclear\nweapons were employed by the\nworld\u2019s wealthiest nations on the\nbasis that if two countries possess\nthem neither will attack the other\nout of fear. They have only ever\nbeen used once- in an attack by the\nUS on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nToday\u2019s nuclear weapons are about\neight times more powerful than\nthose used in Japan and each of the\nTrident missiles could potentially\nkill a million people.\nWars in the twentieth century\nare carried out ostensibly to deal\nwith a minority of dangerous peo-ple; to stop terrorist organisations\nor to remove a dictator. Before the\nwar in Iraq we were promised that\nweapons technology would be used\nto limit civilian deaths and that it\nwould all be over very quickly. It\u2019s\nimpossible to use nuclear weapons\nDemocrat dream ticket may just come true\nThere is no reason for you to have\nheard of a former community organiser and civil rights lawyer\nelected two years ago to the United\nStates Senate after an uncontroversial career in the Illinois State Legislature. But last Saturday, in the\nfrosts of Illinois, invoking the legacy\nof Lincoln and promising to transform American politics, Barack\nObama launched his campaign for\nthe White House. Already, some are\ncalling him the first black President\nof the United States.\nIt\u2019s not hyperbole either: the 45\nyear old is running second only to\nHillary Clinton in opinion polls and\nhis ability to reach across partisan\ndivides gives him a wide support\nbase. He\u2019s clearly rattling some\ncages as well: despite the unwritten\nrule not to interfere in the domestic\npolitics of another nation, Australian Prime Minister and fierce Bush\nally John Howard attacked Obama\non Monday over his views on Iraq.\nAmerica was introduced to\nObama little over two years ago\nwhen he delivered a stirring and\nenthusiastically received speech at\nthe 2004 Democratic National Convention. The media coverage which\nfollowed his condemnation of artificial divides in American politics and\nhis appeal to the \u201caudacity of hope\u201d\nturned him into an instant celebrity.\nWith Bush\u2019s re-election and a generally poor showing by Democrats\nwithout causing civilian deaths.\nThey are often, therefore dismissed\nas inappropriate if the ideals of\nmodern warfare are to be upheld.\nClearly a lot has changed since\nthe 1980s. At that time Tony Blair\nwas younger and more idealis-tic. He was part of a Labour party\nfounded on socialist principles,\nopposed Thatcher\u2019s Conservative\ngovernment and was a proud member of the Campaign for Nuclear\nDisarmament (CND). In 1982 he\ndescribed Trident as \u201cnuclear madness\u201d, a year later he was elected to\nparliament for the first time. Lord\nHattersley, the former deputy leader of the Labour party (who probably wasn\u2019t in the CND) has said\nthat there is no need for a nuclear\ndeterrent now, describing it merely\nas a \u201cstatus symbol\u201d.\nThe Liberal democrats and several others have pointed out that\nthe decision does seem to be going\nto parliament very quickly. They\nhave argued that there needs to be\na more substantial debate before a\ndecision is made. Could it be that\na prime minister with a reputation\ndamaged by anti-war protests, privatisation and scandal is making a\nlast ditch effort to be remembered?\nThe debate on nuclear weapons\nhas brought together members of\nthe two main parties in support of\nTrident but it has also united mass\nmovements against it. The CND\nwill be demonstrating in central\nLondon jointly with the stop the\nwar coalition on Saturday the 24th\nFebruary.\nacross the country a few weeks\nlater, Obama\u2019s convincing victory\nin the Illinois Senate race stood out\nand he was established as the new\nface of the American left.\nSince that 20 minute speech in\nBoston, Oba-mania has reached fever pitch. You\u2019re just as likely to see\nhim debating foreign relations on\nthe news as to see him talking about\nhis childhood on a chat show. You\nCamilla Royle\nChina is the third nation to demonstrate its satellite destroying capabilities\nOmar Hashmi\nPolitics Editor\n6 felix Friday 16 February 2007\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ncan even poke him on Facebook. In\nOctober he published The Audacity\nof Hope: 288 pages of lucid prose\noutlining his political convictions\nand thoughts on \u201creclaiming the\nAmerican dream\u201d. It shot to the top\nof the bestseller lists and remained\nthere in the run up to Christmas\nwith many finding a copy at the bottom of their stockings.\nSo, what is it that turned an unknown politician into a cultural icon\nand a credible contender for Commander in Chief? One clue lies in\nhis ethnic mix: the son of a Kenyan\nfather and a white Kansas mother\nhe can effortlessly bridge the black\nand white divide which still exists\nin some parts of America. Within\nhis varied life story most people\ncan find some common narrative;\nhis everyman image has been mirrored and amplified by a willing me-dia. Or as Obama puts it with characteristic elegance and economy\nof language, \u201cpeople project their\nhopes on me\u201d.\nMoreover, unlike many of his\nSenate colleagues, Obama has yet\nto experience a targeted negative\ncampaign against him. When this\nundoubtedly happens, it is sure to\nadd some wrinkles to that fresh im-age. There are signs of it already:\nin suspicious times having a surname which rhymes with Osama\nand with Hussein as a middle name\nhas made him an easy target for\nthose on the right. With heavy Islamophobic undercurrents, the six\nyears he spent at a Muslim school\nin Indonesia are also coming under\nscrutiny from partisan commenta-tors. CNN have even noted, as if\nthere may somehow be something\nsinister in this, that his trademark\ndress sense, a dark suit with a\nwhite open collar shirt, is similar to\nthat favoured by Iranian President\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nThere is also another hurdle to\nAlex Guite overcome before Obama can become President: securing the Democratic nomination. Clinton has a\ncomfortable lead over him in the\npolls and won\u2019t be easy to beat once\nher campaign gets into full swing.\nSome of have suggested a ClintonObama dream ticket, but whilst\nit\u2019s sure to get Democratic hearts\npounding, the electoral maths sadly doesn\u2019t add up. America may be\nready for a woman or a black man\nin the White House, but particularly\nin the Southern states, it doesn\u2019t\nseem to be ready for both at the\nsame time.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the ClintonObama rivalry will make for entertaining primaries, but his principled opposition to the Iraq war does\ngive him a major advantage over\nhis rivals. Unlike his Democratic rivals in the current election, or John\nKerry in the last, Obama doesn\u2019t\nneed to perform political gymnas-tics; he has no need to reconcile initial support for the war with belated\ncondemnation of the Bush administration\u2019s failings in Iraq.\nThe election is still almost two\nyears away. In that same amount\nof time Obama has travelled from\nobscurity to the national stage.\nWhether or not the next two years\nare Obama\u2019s journey to the White\nHouse remains to be seen. But one\nthing is for sure, you\u2019ll soon have no\ngood reason for not having heard of\nthis former community organiser\nand civil rights lawyer.\nKeep your friends close, and your enemies closer \u2013 Senator Barack\nObama with former President Clinton\nT\nhe next American election is looking like a\ndoozy. Democrats have\ntheir hotshots lined up\nin rows \u2013 not only Clinton and Obama, but John Edwards\n(who ran for VP) is now having a\nshot at the big seat, and even ol\u2019\nfaithful Mr Environment Al Gore\ncould very soon be in the picture.\nThe Republicans too have their own\ncelebrities. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani\n\u2013 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d and national\nhero from 9/11 is standing, as well\nas Senator John McCain, a part of\nAmerica\u2019s political furniture. All\nwe need now is a scandal here, and\nsome closet skeletons there, and\nwe will have a reality show better\nthan big brother can ever give. Who\ncould be apathetic about such an\nexciting election, right?!\nNuclear power has become far\nto useful as a diplomatic and military leverage to ever realistically\nconsider that we will find a world\nwithout them. Therefore, as a collective race we must ensure that\nsome states do not hold others to\nransom with the technologically\nsophisticated yet age-old simplicity\nof brute force. Such conditions can\nonly rise if future rulers allow the\ngrowth and development of other\nnations, including nuclear power,\nand allow much fairer international game-play. If not, then the oppressed might just totally rebel.\n\n"

To be in with\na chance of winning, just answer the following question, entries in an email with the subject line, \u201cWould You Like To See My Ultimate Weapon?\u201d, along with your name, to games.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk by February 23rd, or on a slip of paper with contact details handed into the Felix office (downstairs in the Media Wing of Beit Quad). The winner will be notified\nsoon after the competition closes. It\u2019s a simple question, just tell us:\nWhat is the name of the cute, overfed, exploited, misunderstood and fairly edible-looking yellow chickens that turn up in the Final Fantasy series?\na) Moogles b) Chocobos\nc) Shuffle to the left, shuffle to the right, Scoodlee-ah-ta, scoodlee-ah-ta. Birdie tweet tweet, birdie tweet tweet (tweet tweet).\nIf you ever try and rationalise the\nidea of standing around waiting\nfor your go to kill something, then\nFinal Fantasy\u2019s turn-based system\nimmediately becomes something\nvery ridiculous. But it didn\u2019t need\nto make sense. Frankly, caterpillars the size of houses and scant-ily-clad ice queens that leapt out\nof your head \u201cdidn\u2019t make sense\u201d.\nIt did what it felt like, and you felt\ngood for trusting it.\nAnd the fun was in the scale, any-how. Take a look at Cloud\u2019s impressive weapon (above, not on those\nquestionable websites we frequented last week) and you\u2019ll begin\nto wonder just how strong these\nSOLDIER types have to be in order to carry around what looks like\na dragon\u2019s toothpick. Look at his\narms, for goodness sake! They\u2019re\nlittle spindly sticks!\nNot to mention flying ships the\nsize of cities, flying cities the size of\n\u2026 cities \u2026 exploding planets, fighting black holes \u2013 Final Fantasy was\n\u2013 is \u2013 about a strange kind of immersion that comes when you let go\nof, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I \u2026\u201d and \u201cShouldn\u2019t\nthey \u2026\u201d and begin to accept the\nfantasy that they\u2019re offering. You\ntook control of frogs, and dressed\nup as strange, cat-like creatures\ncalled moogles. No-one questioned\nit, it just seemed like the sensible\nthing to do at the time.\nWhen the eleventh was announced as a massively mutliplay-er online game, there was some\nconcern over where the series was\nheaded. It\u2019s hard to tell whether\nFinal Fantasy XI\u2019s relative failure\nup against the likes of World of\nWarcraft and EVE Online was what\nspurred SquareEnix to return to\nsingle-player form, or whether the\nmerger between Square and Enix\nback in 2003 spurred them back\ninto their story-led roots.\nEither way, Final\nFantasy\nXII is now to be released in the UK\non Playstation2, with XIII already\nannounced for the Playstation3 as\nwell as a series of spinoffs for mobile and an action-oriented game\nfor the PS3 along the lines of Final\nFantasy X-2.\nThere\u2019s no denying that the series has evolved a lot. Originally\nclosed to the idea of revisiting older games, Square produced a film\nextension to Final Fantasy VII \u2013 titled \u201cAdvent Children\u201d \u2013 along with\nseveral anim\u00e9s and game spinoffs\ntelling various pre- and post-game\nstories. A semi-sequel to Final\nFantasy X also followed, as well as\npromises of the same for Final Fantasy XII.\nThere\u2019s always resistance when\nchanges like this occur. The only\ntwo game series to have sold more\nthan Final Fantasy are Pok\u00e9mon\n\u2013 a franchise that doesn\u2019t want to\nchange \u2013 and Mario \u2013 a franchise\nthat doesn\u2019t need to change. Having\nthe third-largest fanbase in gaming\nisn\u2019t an easy thing to handle, especially when the demands of newer\nfans are at odds to those that still\nplay the NES and SNES games in\ntheir original glory.\nAnyone who\u2019s loved a Final Fantasy game \u2013 and even those that\nhated them \u2013 got something out of\nSquare\u2019s much-revered series. But\nchange has to happen, and even\nwithout plot continuity, a series as\nlong-running as this has to change.\nFinal Fantasy XII\u2019s battle system,\nusing a semi-automated adaptation to their turn-based sys-tem, called \u201cGambit\u201d, is\na huge change when\nthe better, rather than a watering down of the same old winning\nformula.\nScreenshots of XIII show the\ngame to be visually stunning, but\nalso considerably different to past\nincarnations \u2013 battles appear to\nhave no turn-based element at all, and even\nthough the videos are\nundeniably concep-tual, it certainly\nshows that\nSquare have\nlost neither\ninventiveness\nnor desire to\ninnovate. A\nnew console always\nmeans\nnew di- rec-tions, and that\ninevita- bly\nmeans more con-troversy. But for many gamers,\nthey\u2019re willing to stay the course,\njust as Square has done, for another twenty years more.\nFinal Fantasy games are still\nremarkably hard to find on some\nplatforms, still being reinvented\nand rereleased through emulators and independent\ndevelopers, and still\na firm part of\npop culture\n\u2013 some- thing\nthat is unlikely to change,\nwelded as they\nare into the history\nof videogaming.\nThe old days of Final Fantasy may be coming to a close,\nbut the next generation seems to\nbe a fresh enough experience to\nwarrant keeping up with. Whatever\nthe outcome, there\u2019s no sense of\nfinality yet at SquareEnix, and the\nfuture suggests there\u2019ll be plenty\nmore random battling to come.\ncompared to the\nstringent ATB,\nwait-your-turn styles of\nSNES versions and earlier.\nBut it looks set to be a change for\nHow times change: Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Cloud Strife, shown on the previous page, in his Advent Children incarnation. Amazingly, Final Fantasy XIII looks similar to this in-game\n25\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\nGAMES felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Digging up the Royal School of Mines\u2019 past\n\u201cOne of the biggest things about\nthe Royal School of Mines is the\ntradition,\u201d says Seb Turner, current\npresident of the RSM. It isn\u2019t hard\nto believe this as we sit in the impressive foyer of the Royal School\nof Mines building on Prince Consort Road. The RSM has existed, in\none form or other, for well over 150\nyears. And that gives its members a\ndifferent perspective on Imperial\u2019s\ncentenary year.\nThe Royal School of Mines began life in 1851 as the Government\nSchool of Mines and Science Applied to the Arts, and it gathered\nits first teaching staff from the Geological Survey and the Museum of\nEconomic Geology. It underwent a\nnumber of name changes in its first\ndecade, but eventually became the\nRSM in 1863. In these early days,\nthe school was located on Jermyn\nStreet, south of Piccadilly. It was\nnot until 1872 that the school moved\nwest to South Kensington, taking\nup residence in the Huxley Building on Exhibition Road. That building is now the Henry Cole wing of\nthe Victoria and Albert Museum;\nthe RSM moved to its current location in 1913.\nOf course, by that time the RSM\nwas no longer an independent\nschool. \u201cIn 1907 we merged into\nthe Imperial College name as one\nof the founding schools,\u201d Seb ex-plains. The merger would benefit\nboth: \u201cThe reputation of Imperial\nand the Royal School of Mines,\nthey\u2019re both as impressive as each\nother,\u201d he continues. So, I suggest,\njust like Norwich Union, \u2018together\nwe\u2019re stronger\u2019? \u201cIn some ways,\nyeah!\u201d he laughs.\nIn 2001 Imperial moved to a faculty structure, with the RSM joining\nCity & Guilds in the newly formed\nFaculty of Engineering. In a student\nreferendum, engineering students\nopted for the name \u201cCity & Guilds\u201d\nfor their student union, with the 100-year-old RSM Union ceasing to ex-Colin Barras\nist in 2001. \u201cI think one of the main\nreasons for that was it was just too\nsmall. Compared to City & Guilds\nor the Medicine Union. There were\nthe three big Unions and us, the\nsmaller one,\u201d explains Seb. But the\nRSM fought back and, in 2002, it\nwas recognised as a Clubs and Societies Committee within the wider\nUnion. The RSM name was pre-served. \u201cWe\u2019re well over 100 years\nold as a Union, and the department\nis over 150 years old. So it would\nhave been a shame to lose it,\u201d says\nSeb. \u201cBut the other thing is, I think\nthe students in this department are\nslightly different to the students at\nthe rest of Imperial. I think they are\nslightly more outgoing.\u201d\nImperial students had reason\nto thank those outgoing RSM students in 2005; when the Southside\nBar was closed, the RSM was at the\nheart of the campaign for a replace-ment. \u201cThat campaign was led by\nthe RSM and the Real Ale society,\u201d\nSeb tells me. \u201cTobias Dalton, who\nfounded the Real Ale Society, was\nthe forerunner. It was only because\nof those moves that Harrington\u2019s\nwas ever built. It was never in the\nplans to be there.\u201d\nThe RSM may be small, but it is\nvery active. Evidence for that can\nbe seen in the wide range of societies and events within the RSM.\nChief among the events is the Bottle Match, played every year against\nCamborne School of Mines, part of\nthe University of Exeter. The first\nmatch took place in 1902, which\nmakes it one of the oldest varsity\nmatches in the world, second only\nto the Oxford and Cambridge boat\nrace. The teams compete for a 3-foot-tall beer bottle that fell off the\nback of a lorry and into the possession of RSM students in 1946.\nThis year\u2019s match, the 105th Bottle, begins on Friday 23rd February.\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting it under the title of\n\u2018Centenary Bottle Match\u2019,\u201d says\nSeb, \u201calthough the 100 year Bottle\nMatch was actually five years ago.\u201d\nWe can but hope that Imperial\u2019s\n100th anniversary will inspire the\nRSM to retain the bottle for an eleventh straight year.\nSo, how else does the 150 year-old RSM plan to mark Imperial\u2019s\ncentenary? \u201cWe have plans to do a\nfew events,\u201d Seb says. He picks up\na leaflet that is lying on the table in\nfront of us. It\u2019s an advert for a symposium that is being organised by\nRSM\u2019s De La Beche Society later in\nFebruary. \u201cThis is going under the\ntitle \u2018Centenary Symposium\u2019, on\nFrontier Geology. And we\u2019re having a talk by one of the retired lec-turers, Professor Dick Selley. He\u2019s\nbeen doing a lot of research into the\nhistory of the RSM and the departments over the last 100 years, which\nwill be the main centenary event.\nThat\u2019ll happen later this term or in\nthe summer.\u201d\nThe RSM may have had some\nhard times in recent years, but it\nseems to be a vibrant organisation\ntoday. Seb agrees: \u201cMaybe 300 or\n400 of the students go to an RSM\nevent at some point in the year.\nThat\u2019s nearly 50% of our members.\u201d\nI\u2019m suitably impressed. \u201cThe RSM\nis a good reason to get together.\nPeople love being a part of it. They\nwear the regalia with pride.\u201d With\npride? \u201cYeah! We\u2019ve got all sorts of\nthings. Hoodies, t-shirts, ties, which\nsell really well.\u201d And I can think of\nno more appropriate blend of the\nold and new within the RSM than a\nHoodie bearing the RSM logo.\nWhy did you choose to complete\nyour PhD at Imperial?\nIn my mind, Imperial College was\nthe best Engineering College in\nEngland.\nSo I felt lucky to have the opportunity to do my postgraduate work\nin the Communications section of\nthe Electrical Engineering Department. I even had the brilliant Colin\nCherry as my supervisor. He was an\neccentric genius whom I admired\ngreatly, and who was a wonderful\nmentor.\nWhatdoyouremembermostabout\nyour three years at Imperial?\nI had a fantastic time at Imperial.\nI was a poor student like everyone\nelse and lived in 4 different bedsits,\nall within walking distance of the\nCollege. I became an expert, again\nlike everyone else, at finding events\nthat were giving out free food!\nLife was simple: I was poor but\nhealthy, and nothing distracted me\nfrom my work. I was able to focus\ntotally on my research.\nWith all this research going on, did\nyou find any time to participate in\ngroups or sports?\nI played on the College water-polo\nteam, as well as on the University of\nLondon team. We actually won the\nBritish University championships\nin 1971! I also swam for the College,\nand was a major user of the squash\ncourts.\nDo you believe there is something\nspecific from those years that\nhelped you become the first Canadian in space?\nI think the fact that Imperial College has such a solid international\nreputation helped a lot. Also, having lived abroad, I was viewed as\nhaving a broader experience in international issues.\nYou grew up mainly in Canada.\nWas there something from home\nthat you missed while you were\nabroad?\nOnce in a while, I needed to get out\nof London into the wide open spac-es. I\u2019d escape and go on hikes in the\nLake District, Scotland or Wales.\nPerhaps that\u2019s the Canadian in me!\nSo, while you probably can\u2019t see Imperial College from space, there is\napparently no limit to how far a degree from Imperial can take you.\n5\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial alumnus Marc Garneau, far right, and his fellow astronauts\nThe familar logo of the Royal School of Mines which began life way back in 1851\n\n"

    "content": "February butterflies\nIt was strange being the only first-year on this weekend\u2019s trip, but as\nit was explained to me when I mentioned this, everyone else probably\nneeds to get out more. And what a\nplace to get out to! It will no doubt\nsurprise everyone that during the\ntwo days and nights of our trip\nto the North York Moors I didn\u2019t\nsee a single cloud except for tiny\nwisps far away. The sheer beauty\nof a landscape so barren and yet\nso diverse with its rolling moors\nand frosty valleys, emerging out of\nwinter but still baring all to a cold\nclear sky was breathtaking. This is\nsurely the farthest from London an\nEnglish landscape is likely to get.\nAs usual the health-and-safety-defying minibus which I shall call\n\u2018the yellow one\u2019 (I can see you nodding now), sped away from London\nto a relatively clear motorway with\nthe characteristic \u2018Marcus wants\ncock \u2013 Imperial College London\n\u2013 how\u2019s my driving?\u2019 written on\nthe back. At our dinner stop at a\nchippie on the way north we soon\nrealised how cold it was going to\nbe, as the temperature plummeted\nupon stepping outside. And yes the\nchippie had battered Mars bars\n\u2013 that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re in\nthe north. After one more stop to\npick up Andy from Doncaster station and a journey filled with the\neither stupidly quiet or unbearably loud radio, we arrived, amidst\nthe moors, at a surprisingly early\n11:45pm. The moon was full and\nthe sky completely clear with the\nstars showing in their hundreds;\nsometimes in London I forget they\nexist. As the camping barn was just\nas cold as outside (they really did\nmean it when they said \u2018barn\u2019) we\ndid what should be the only government test of \u2018Britishness\u2019: we made\ntea \u2013 and it was warm. We admired\nthe cooker and the working fridge\nand settled into our sleeping bags\nat around 1am, after Nathaniel\nmade his special double bed so he\nwouldn\u2019t fall out and Evelyne went\nto bed sporting the entire Blacks\nwinter catalogue, wearing about 15\nlayers of brightly coloured clothes.\nI couldn\u2019t help feeling jealous when\nTim commented that his sleeping\nbag was \u2018toasty warm\u2019, whilst mine\nshowed me the other end of the\nspectrum.\nAfter a bizarre night \u2013 deranged\ncockerels determined to wake us\nup every hour and Nathaniel talking in his sleep \u2013 we woke at 7am to\nthe sunrise, which was so perfect\nin the clear frosty morning that\nTim exclaimed \u2018oh my God!\u2019 and\nran outside. At that moment I seriously thought someone had stolen\nthe mini-bus or run it over with a\ntractor, but alas no. At 8:30am we\nleft the barn and walked across the\nvalley bottom, still white with frost,\nand climbed up to the level of the\nmoors, a few hundred metres up.\nGrass and small trees soon became heather and gorse and the\nview stretched away on all sides\ninto the distance. We followed a\nstraight track for almost half an\nhour through the near silence of a\nlandscape more suited to the moon\nbefore reaching the Cleveland\nWay, a long-distance walking route\nthrough Yorkshire. Bearing slightly\nwest we followed the Way along the\nstraight path of an old railway line,\nconstantly being startled by grouse\nbursting out of the undergrowth,\nyapping like small dogs. It wasn\u2019t\nlong before someone found remnants of snow, tucked into the dips\non either side of the path where the\nsun hadn\u2019t shone. The snow (which\nwas really more like ice) was a bit\ntoo hard to throw but we were content with shoving it down each other\u2019s necks. Before long we came to\nthe highest point in that part of the\nmoors, the stomach-turning 454m\nhigh Round Hill, so called as it is\nthe site of a neolithic burial and has\na characteristic mound. It is probably this feature alone that makes it\nthe highest point but luckily for us\nthe top was graced by a trig point,\nmaking it relatively easy to find.\nOur route then took us off the\nmoors down to a road and then\nback up the other side to a section\nof moorland standing alone, gouged\nby glaciers on each side. Its elevated position at the northernmost\nedge of the moors gave us a view\nover the flat fields below all the way\nto Middlesborough and beyond until obscured by the mid-day haze.\nOne of the glacier-gouged edges\nof this section of moor forms a\nwell used climbing and scrambling\ndestination, the Wain Stones. We\nstopped for lunch perched on the\nstones at the top of the drop. It was\nso warm we could have sunbathed\n... in February. Later in the day we\nsaw several butterflies which probably shouldn\u2019t be there until May.\nAfter lunch we began our route\nback which first descended into\nthe valley mostly occupied by small\nwoods, fields of kale and pheasants.\nNavigating in the valley proved\nharder than up on the featureless\nmoor (I have no idea why) and it\ntook several attempts to finally find\nour way to the path back up to the\nmoors again.

    "content": "This year\u2019s ice-climbing tour visited the Briancon valley in the last\nweek of January. After a quick flight\nto Turin, Italy, the group hired cars\nand hopped across the border into\nFrance. Our base for the week\nwas a rather lovely gite d\u2019\u00e9tape in\nVallouise, just up the valley from\nL\n\u2019Argentiere-la-Bess\u00e9e which hosts\nabigice-climbingfestivaleveryyear\nin the second week of January. The\nlean winter had taken its toll on this\nyear\u2019s festival, with temperatures\nsimply too warm for many of the ice\ncascades to form. Two weeks later,\nwhen we visited, things weren\u2019t\nmuch better but at least the valleys\nhad some ice, which was more than\ncould be said for the other traditional ice-climbing areas in the Alps.\nWe decided to have a leisurely\nfirst day by visiting the Fournel val-ley. This valley was close to where\nwe were staying and the climbs\nweren\u2019t far from the road hence we\nthought it would be a nice easy day.\nHowever it was not to be. The road\nhadn\u2019t been (snow-)ploughed and\nour small cars, complete with snow\nchains, struggled to make their way\nthrough the deep snow. With a lot of\nperseverance and a bit of pushing\nwe got our vehicles as far up the\nroad as we could (and further along\nthe road than any other vehicle including a four-by-four) before drifts\nforced us to park and walk the rest\nof the way. The trek to the climbs\ntook longer than envisaged as we\nhadn\u2019t driven as far along the road\nas we\u2019d thought. Once at the end of\nthe road we headed for the nearest\npiece of climbable ice we could see;\nLes nains des ravines (IV/4), as time\nwas pressing on. The ice was thin\nand in places covered with snow.\nAlex and Neil climbed the first pitch\nwhile the rest of us practised placing ice screws and setting up belays\nusing abakalovs. We then set up a\nshort top rope so those who hadn\u2019t\nclimbed on water ice before could\npractise the technique. A long walk\nback to the cars followed which we\nreached just before dark.\nThe next day was spent climbing at Ceillac. Ceillac is normally\na popular place to climb because\nthe ice falls are close to the road\nand many of them are classic multi-pitch routes. However it was exceptionally busy as it was the weekend\nand only a couple of ice falls had\nformed. Mike and Chris joined the\ngroup of people waiting to climb\nY Gully right branch 250m (II/3+)\nwhile the rest of us decided to hike\nup the side of the valley to the not-so-busy Easy Rider 70m (II/3). The\ngully was narrow and the ice thin,\nwhich meant there wasn\u2019t that\nmuch room for different people to\nclimb at once. Fortunately we were\nthe first people on the ice so this\nwasn\u2019t a problem and we enjoyed\nthe two pitches of 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 ice\nbefore abseiling back down. Afterwards the fast climbers went and\nfollowed Mike and Chris up Y Gully\nright branch 250m (II/3+) as the\nqueues had gone. Meanwhile the\nrest of us traversed along the valley\nto check the condition of the other\ncascades.\nOur target for Sunday was the\nCrevoux valley in an attempt to\navoid the Sunday crowds. It was\na long drive from where we were\nstaying so we set off early, however\nthe place wasn\u2019t well signposted\nand we ended up going round in circles looking for the turn-off from the\nmain road. Our objective was the\nCascade du Razis 70m (II/3+ to 5+)\nwhich was an hour and a half\u2019s walk\nfrom the car park. The wall of ice\nlooked promising on the approach\nbut as we got closer we found part\nof the right hand side, which was\nhome to the easiest angled climbs,\nhad not fully formed and the rest\nwas taken up by guided groups who\nhad set up top ropes. Thus we were\nleft to climb on the hard ice on the\nleft side of the wall. Mike put in a\ngood lead to get halfway up the wall\nbut didn\u2019t fancy the crux. Chris set\nup a top rope so we could retrieve\nthe ice screws and then complete\nthe climb in relative safety. Meanwhile Alex and Neil climbed a hard\nfull 50m line in between the top\nropes on the right hand side. Next,\na couple of French climbers let us\nuse their top rope to have a go on\na sustained pitch of vertical (grade\n5) ice. On such steep ice, it wasn\u2019t\nlong before we were all pretty tired.\nWe retrieved our equipment and\nwalked out, reaching the car just as\nthe sun set below the horizon.\nThe following day we returned\nto Ceillac in the hope that it might\nbe quieter. There was no such luck.\nOver twenty people were waiting\nat the bottom of the main climbs.\nMatt and I went over and climbed\nthe first pitch of Sombre H\u00e9ros\n100m (II/5) (the second pitch had\nnot formed). Meanwhile the others\nqueued for the left branch of Y Gully Holiday on ice 250m (II/3+). By\nthe time we\u2019d finished on Sombre\nH\u00e9ros there was no one waiting at\nthe bottom of Y Gully so we climbed\nall six awesome pitches of the right\nbranch.\nThe final two days were spent\nback in the Fournel valley. The road\nhad been cleared so we were able\nto drive all the way to the car park\nat the end of the road. The first\nday we walked for about an hour\nalong the valley from the car park\nwhere teams climbed on Capitaine\nCourageux 200m (III/4+) and Damocl\u00e9s 230m (III/4+). Both routes\nwere long, sustained and energy\nsapping. Time passed quickly as\nslow progress was made and the\nlast group ended up abseiling back\ndown under a full moon. The abseil\npitches were a little longer than our\n50m ropes so a little improvisation\nwas called for. Once everyone was\ndown safely from the climbs we all\ntrudged wearily back through the\nsnow to the car guided by our head\ntorches.\nOn the last day we decided to\nclimb Grand Bleu 100m (III/4)\nwhich sat high up on the valley\nside. Unable to find the path we\ntrail-bashed our way over a boulder\nfield covered in knee-deep snow until we found the well trodden path\nhigher up. We arrived at the foot of\nthe climb exhausted from the ap-proach. The first pitch was a full\n50m of 75\u00b0 ice which turned out to\nbe a bit wet and gooey but this was\nnice to climb on compared with the\nhard brittle ice we had encountered\nfurther up the valley. The second\npitch was some 45m in length and\ninclined at an average 85\u00b0. Alex led\nthe pitch while the rest of us were\nhappy to second. At the top, the ice\nwas thin and unstable as it sandwiched a layer of snow. A slab of ice\na metre in size sheared off and hurtled through the air towards those\ntied into the belay some 40m below.\nIt hit the ice above them and broke\nup. Luckily their helmets took the\nbrunt of the shower and they were\nleft with nothing more than sore\nheads and a few bruises. Undeterred everyone made it to the top\nbefore abseiling back down. The 70\u00b0\nfirst pitch of the neighbouring cascade called Balade du Piaf (III/3)\nlooked easy compared to what we\nhad just climbed. It was tempting\nto zoom up it, however our muscles\nached from the cumulative effects\nof a weeks worth of ice climbing. So\nwe called it a day and thus ended\nthe tour on a high by climbing some\nof the hardest ice we\u2019d climbed all\nweek. We headed back to the gite\nd\u2019\u00e9tape to celebrate what had been\na most enjoyable and memorable\nweek.\nThis tour would not have been\npossible without the support from\nImperial College Union, the Harlington Trust and the IC Trust. Our\nsincere thanks goes to them all.\nTreading on thin ice\nDan Carrivick\nA slab of ice\nhurtled through\nthe air towards\nthose 40m below\nThese two unsuspecting pitches didn\u2019t know what hit them when Matt arrived, a glint in his eye as he wielded his ice-axe\nSeems quite a lot of effort to fill a whisky tumbler\n31\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "23\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhe world of Hyrule has\nalways been a very\nstrange place indeed.\nNot just because of the\ntrolls, skeletons, Zora,\nand larger than life Hulk Hogan\nlook-alike Gorons but because\neveryone repeatedly manages to\nget amnesia. How many times has\nZelda fluttered her eyes at Link?\nHow many times has Hyrule Castle undergone an architectural\nmakeover? And how many times\nhas Ganondorf been skewered by\nLink\u2019s Master Sword? Matron! Yet,\nalthough gamers are entirely\nfamiliar with this world\nthey\u2019re eagerly prepared\nto plough into getting\nthe same\ngirl once\nagain.\nEach\niteration of\nZelda\ndoesat-tempt\nto re-invigorate the\nSuccessful Twilight emergence\nAs the sun goes down on Nintendo\u2019s latest Link adventure, Tom Roberts asks if it was worth it\nZant and it\u2019s up to our young hero\nto save the kingdom once again.\nThis time he has the help of a creature called Midna, best described\nas Hey Arnold\u2019s long lost cousin.\nShe has the power to transform\nLink into a wolf as and when neces-sary. Midna and Zant suit the world\ncomfortably, whilst bringing elements of darkness to the glowing\nfairy tale land. Zant is a suitably\nfearful replacement for Ganondorf\nand Midna\u2019s introduction is surprisingly startling whilst she toys with\nLink. It\u2019s indicative of the love-dis-trust relationship that you hold\nwith the little imp, something\nwhich niggles at the back of\nyour mind throughout the\ngame.\nHer power to transform you\ninto a wolf is perhaps the\nbravest creative decision\nin such a huge series\nsince having to play as\nRaiden in Metal Gear\nSolid 2. For large\nchunks of the game,\nyou\u2019re tasked with\nsniffing scents and\ndigging to gain access\nto certain areas. The\nchoice brings welcome\nvariation, but the controls are certainly less\nintuitive as the wolf.\nAt the very least,\nthe Wii remote is as\ngood as a Gamecubecontroller,\nevenimprov-A button can send you plummeting\nover the edge of a cliff.\nThe dungeon format remains\nfaithful, complete with small keys,\ndaddy keys, and exceptionally well\ndesigned layouts and puzzles. The\ntemples are intricately designed,\nlulling you into a sense of awe at\nthe potential complexity awaiting\nyour discovery when they are in\nfact generally linear experiences.\nObtain small key, progress to find\nthe next. The genius arises when\nyou arrive back at the entrance\nroom, better equipped and having\npushed the necessary blocks into\nplace so that you can finally reach\nthat mysterious hole in the ceiling.\nThe sense of achievement and everything falling into place is deeply\ngratifying and you\u2019re rewarded\nwith a trademark boss encounter;\nan experience you enjoy rather\nthan dread. The sand temple\u2019s boss\nis especially fun.\nOne minor oft cited criticism is\nthe save mechanism in the dungeons whereby you have to return\nto the entrance after turning off the\nconsole. Personally, my compulsive\nnature meant that I completed dungeons in one sitting and when this\ndidn\u2019t happen, Nintendo had the\nsense to never take the adventure\nfar away from the entrance room.\nAs with all of the Zelda games,\nTwilight Princess is a fine example\nof OCD sufferer\u2019s worst nightmare.\nThere are numerous caves to un-cover, almost a hundred bugs and\npoes to collect, not to mention the\nfishing side game, or simulator as\nis perhaps more appropriate with\nthe Wii remote. Having clocked up\naround 55 epic hours after finishing the game, I am actually considering returning to it, a testament to\nthe game\u2019s success and something\nwhich Grand Theft Auto has never\nmanaged to do. There are easily\nanother 10 to 20 hours of exploring\nand the initial fifty or so are some of\nthe most addictive I\u2019ve ever played.\nYou will never find yourself wishing\nthe game will hurry up so that you\ncan get started on the next and this\nis a soul saver for those of us who\nlike to finish our games without\nthe pang of post-purchase-not-pol-ished-off-guilt.\nTwilight Princess feels special\nfrom the very first moment that you\nhop onto Epona and gallop around\nthe Ordon ranch. Soon after hopping the gate to Hyrule\u2019s fields of\nfreedom, Twilight Princess steps\nup a gear when Link has to pursue\na band of thieving orcs and goblins.\nYou\u2019re tasked with rescuing a kidnapped girl whilst on horseback.\nThe A button whips Epona into a\ngallop and quickly you\u2019re closing in\nonthebandits.Swingingtheremote\nsword slashes the goblins, sending\nthem flying backwards whilst their\noversized boars plough into\nturf. Twilight Princess gives speed\nand aggression to\nepic Lord Of The\nRings style fights.\nThey\u2019re\nfaces and lashing tentacle dreadlocks drop out of the sky at regular intervals to halt your progress.\nThere are similarly haunting dark\nwyverns and it\u2019s clear that somebody at Nintendo has been watching The Matrix, though thankfully\nthe makers have done the art justice here.\nTwilight Princess is not entirely\nwithout its gripes however. When\nwill a game perfect swimming un-derwater? Why does Link insist on\nclimbing side ways round that vine\nridden wall, rather than hauling\nhimself on the ledge? These are\nminor faults;\na pimple\non the\nGoron\nKing\u2019s rotund\nrear end, of\ncourse.\nMore importantly\nis whether the game\nhas overhauled itself enough for its latest outing. The additional\ncharacters are well imple-mented, the new weapons\nand items are a pleasure\nto use and frequently more\nfun than any of the recurring ones,\nand the story is pleasingly more\nbizarre than before. Twilight Princess has not undergone a dramatic\nsea change though; we\u2019re not even\nin the Wind Waker territory of dar-ingness. What\u2019s clear is that the\ncompulsion to keep playing, the\nmagnificent gameplay and sheer\nquality of design is unmatched by\nprevious offerings. This is the best\nZelda game created.\nThat is one hell of a statement and\ncan only warrant one outcome.\nYou buying it.\nseries with a subtle twist to the\nstory or the gameplay and Twilight\nPrincess is no different, this time\nfashionably attempting to obtain a\n12A rating by being \u201cdarker than\never before\u201d\u2122. Hyrule is being\ngradually descended into the twilight realm by evil cloak-wearer\ning bow and arrow aiming and generally being more relaxing having\nyour hands further apart or resting\non your lap. But as the wolf, often\nyou find yourself mashing A to rip\nat the necks of opponents, rather\nthan waving, which has the effect\nof making you twitch like you\u2019ve got\nfleas. Even then, a jump using the\namongst the most enjoyable sections of the game in between dungeon dwelling and a fine example\nof the capabilities of the Wii control setup \u2013 galloping, turning, and\nslashing simultaneously.\nGraphically, the game is perfectly acceptable although it lacks\nthe quality of the Gamecube\u2019s best\nsuch as Resi Evil 4. The characters\nare lovingly detailed, however, especially the nightmarish enemies\nfrom the Twili realm. Large, bounding black trolls with shields for\nThere\u2019s a sense of crescendo to Twilight Princess \u2013 years of Nintendo innovation has paid off for them, and they can finally unleash the games they always wanted to make\n\n"

    "content": "So there we were, the corridor of\nrock ending just ahead. The usual\npool of muddy water lay in front of\nthe sheer wall. Strangely a rope\nled from a bolt on the left, down\nthrough the mirrored surface and\ninto the depths. We were on the far-side of Sump I in Swildon\u2019s Hole. To\ngo back now the way we had come\nwas impossible \u2013 other sumps that\nwe had emptied with buckets and\nsiphons would have refilled by now\nwith the slow percolation of water\nfrom the surface. Our only way\nout was to dive through this short\nflooded section before climbing the\n150 metres (nearly twice the height\nof the Queen\u2019s Tower) back to the\nsurface.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple!\u201d I explain to the first-timers, \u201cLie down in the water to\nget used to the cold and flood your\nwetsuit, take a deep breath and\nthen pull yourself hand-over-hand\non the guide line.

A few anxious seconds, then the\ntugs coming back on the line and\nthe next caver getting ready.\nFinally I was alone. The tugs\ncame. I lay down in the water, and\nfelt the icy fingers slip in through\nthe seals around my neck. Alone,\nand a long way from a place of safe-ty.

Too low. Hand over hand\non the rope. Hit the rock ceiling.\nToo high. Am I there yet? There\u2019s\nno way to tell what\u2019s going on above\n\u2013 had better continue rather than\nrisk snagging my helmet.\nSuddenly I\u2019m grabbed under the\narmpits and wrenched out of the\nwater. I gasp, pick myself up and\nstumble out-of-kilter from the pool.\nJust a few seconds; but the cold\nis sapping.

The line snaked through the\nroof of the moors and we came very\nclose at one point to a heather fire,\nwhich the rangers create and control to help out the grouse which\nlike heather at different heights.\nThe smoke from these fires undulated up into the darkening sky\n(it\u2019s all physics) and through them\nthe sun shone red. The setting sun\ntinted vast swathes of heather purple and soon the heat we had begun\nto get used to started to dissipate\nas the sun finally vanished behind\nthe hills. Being passed by cyclists\nwas normal; what wasn\u2019t normal\nwas when a pair stopped beside us\nand said they had a message from\nTim! We were to go to the pub instead and meet him there! (Now we\nsee why Tim is the president of the\nsociety). Nathaniel repeatedly told\nus over the next two hours that the\npub really wasn\u2019t that far and that\n(although it wasn\u2019t on the map)\nwe\u2019d be there soon. Soon enough,\na building far in the distance came\ninto view. \u2018That can\u2019t be it, that\u2019s\nway too far\u2019 \u2013 Nathaniel. (It was).\nThe Lion Inn, which we reached\nin the dark, was definitely worth\nit. It must be one of the most remote pubs in England, high on the\nmoors, and yet it was still packed\nfull. Slanting stone walls and open\nfires completed the experience as\nwe finally got a drink in a building\nbuilt by monks in 1553. We later returned to the pub after a brilliant\nsupper eaten in the comfort of our\nown freezing barn with a heater that\ndecided to belch smoke for an hour\nand deliver very little heat. The pub\nthough was warm and we stayed\nuntil 11:20pm playing gin rummy\nand taking photos of Evelyne, Nathaniel and Katherin asleep. I slept\nmuch better that night, probably\nbecause we walked 18 miles, but\nalso as I was thankful to be alive after Richard bombed it down a 20%\nslope (after stalling ).\nSunday was as warm as Saturday\nand we had decided the night before to do a coastal walk from Robin\nHood\u2019s Bay to Scarborough. The\ndrive through the countryside was\nbeautiful as the sun shone through\nthe windows and the surrounding\ntrees were still coated with frost.\nIt was like going back in time. We\npassed Whitby, Dracula\u2019s landing\nplace, and soon arrived at Robin\nHood\u2019s Bay, a small town on the\nside of a slope down to the sea. I\nhad heard that it used to be a smuggling haven and there is a story that\nthe houses are so close and jumbled\nthat a ball of string can be threaded\nthrough all the houses merely by\npassing it through the windows.\nRichard was still poorly so stayed\nwith the minibus, which became\na taxi. The rest of us set off along\nthe cliffs that tumbled down far to\nthe sea below. The sides of the cliffs\nvaried from steep grassy banks to\nsmall woods to sheer stone drops\nand soon we came upon \u2018Beast\ncliff\u2019 which wasn\u2019t really a beast.\nThe route dipped down and then\nback up again several times before\nthe flat sand of the beach where\nwe took a stroll, wandering up to\nthe flat sea. After kicking aside\nstrange piles of chalk (which we\nlater found out was being used to\nmark out a race route) we stopped\nfor lunch in a field on the side of a\nrise in the cliff height, which meant\nwe could see for many miles ahead.\nWe still had no idea how far it was\nto Scarborough; Richard (there\nwere two!) had some nasty blisters and we wanted to get back to\nLondon before Monday. Therefore\nwe decided to divert Richard (driv-ing the minibus) to meet us earlier\nalong the route. Blistered Richard\nbattled bravely on as we descended\ninto the beautiful National Trust\nnature reserve of Hayburn Wyke,\nwhere a storybook-setting waterfall flowed out to the sea. The way\nback up to the cliffs proved to be the\nlast major ascent of the day and it\nwasn\u2019t long, still in the heat of the\nday, before we found the minibus\n(at around 4pm) to begin the 7-hour\ndrive back to London. The sunset\nthat evening was magnificent as we\ndrove through Yorkshire to the 80\u2019s\ntunes from Yorkshire Coast Radio.\nWe had a hugely extended journey\ndue to many diversions and traffic\njams on motorways, and of course\nthe stop for a pub supper \u2013 which\nwas completely devoured \u2013 gold\nstars all round. Finally arriving\nback in London we were all sad\nto say goodbye to the yellow mystery machine that had became our\nfriend; well done everyone, another\ngreat weekend.\nThe Fellwanderers organise weekend trips such as this every fort-night; day walks in and around\nLondon are also fortnightly.

    "content": "Imperial\u2019s very own astronaut\nWhat does Imperial College look\nlike from space? Undoubtedly very\nsmall, but Imperial has one alumnus who\u2019s had the chance to see\nit for himself. Marc Garneau, who\nreceived his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Imperial in 1973, became the first Canadian in space in\nOctober 1984.\nMuch of Garneau\u2019s life reads like\nthe diary of an over-achiever. Born\nin 1949 to a French-Canadian fam-ily, Garneau grew up in and around\nFelix looks back over the life of former IC Electrical Engineer Marc Garneau and poses a few questions\nMichelle Picard-Aitken\nToken French-Canadian\nQuebec City, except for three years\nin the early 60s, when his fgiddy-ather was posted in London. (Gar-neau attended the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais\nde Londres, just down the street\nfrom Imperial College on Cromwell\nRoad.) After obtaining his B.Sc. in\nEngineeringPhysicsfromtheRoyal\nMilitary College of Kingston (Cana-da), Garneau immediately began\nhis doctoral studies at Imperial.\nUpon his return to Canada, Garneau joined the Canadian Navy\nto fulfill his ambition of sailing the\nhigh seas. He quickly worked his\nway through several postings, from\nCombat Systems Engineer (1974)\nto Project Engineer (1977), Commander (1982), and finally Captain\n(1986). During this time, his accomplishments dealt mainly with\ndeveloping, improving and troubleshooting naval weapons systems\nand communications.\nNo doubt Garneau\u2019s impressive\ntrack record, not to mention his superb physical condition, helped him\nbecome one of six chosen from 4000\napplicants for the new Canadian\nAstronaut Program (CAP).\nGarneau was then picked to be\nCanada\u2019s first astronaut in March\n1984. Nine months later \u2013 the\nshortest training of any astronaut\nin NASA\u2019s history at that time, he\nfound himself staring down the\nEarth from the Challenger Shuttle.\nActing as Payload Specialist for the\neight-day mission, he thus became\nthe first Canadian in space, and a\nnational hero.\nSpeaking to the media from\nspace, Garneau looked both giddy\nand awed: \u201cWhen you look out at\nyour own planet and see absolutely\nout-of-this-world incredible views\nof entire subcontinents, you begin\nto appreciate what the world is really like.\u201d\nBitten by the space travel bug,\nGarneau gave up his naval career\nin 1989 to devote himself to the\nCanadian space program, and undertake further pilot and astronaut\ntraining.\nAs a result, Garneau was chosen\nby NASA to fly twice more out of\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere, as Mission Specialist on the Endeavour\nShuttle in May 1996 and December\n2000. His role in these missions involved conducting experiments, as\nwell as helping assemble the International Space Station. In his free\ntime, he loved to float while listening to Beethoven or Bach on his\nWalkman.\nBack on Earth after his last mis-sion, Garneau became director of\nthe Canadian Space Agency (CSA),\nbut left his post in 2005 to run for\noffice in the federal elections. Although he lost the election, he remains an active member of the\nLiberal Party of Canada. Garneau\nis also currently Chancellor of Carleton University, sits on the board of\nseveral charities and participates in\nfederal working groups dealing with\nenergy, health and air pollution.\nHe often speaks publicly of the 19\ndays he spent in space, of the spiritual awe he experienced, as well as\nhis horror in seeing the impact of\nhuman activity on the planet. From\nthe shuttle windows, Garneau saw\nthe fires burning through the Amazonian forest, beige clouds of air\npollution hanging over California\nand the Mediterranean basin, and\nLake Chad shrinking while desertification spreads over the African\nsubcontinent.\nMarc Garneau now lives in Montreal, Canada, where is often seen\nwalking his dog. From his home,\nGarneau recently told Felix about\nhis experience at Imperial College.\n4 felix Friday 16 February 2007\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMarc Garneau flexing his electrical engineering muscles\n\n"

With this\nmuch experience I would expect a\nlittle more imagination than that\nseen on Love You More. Starting\nwith a mix of Coldplay piano and\nInterpol guitar, Genn sings such\ngems as 'I love you more than my\nAdidas trainers, I love you more\nthan Tony Soprano, and if you\nknew me better that's a fuck of a\nlot' \u2013 I just pray they got paid for\nproduct placement.\nAdmittedly that song does develop some interest but like most of\nthe album, tonky piano sees almost\nKeane like over use. Thankfully it\nisn't a white wash and tracks such\nas Back When You Were Good fall\nnicely into the quality, easy listening niche.\nTowards the end of the album\nthings start to look better, I Need\nTo Know injects a subtle dose of\npunk into the handclap type sounds\nwhich seems to be every song. The\nanthemic People Say which moves\naway from the general sound of\nthe album showes heavy influence\nfrom late 90s indie groups before\nthe album wraps up with Let Me\nBreathe, a mush of romantic sing-ing, swelling guitars and strings in\nthe back ground \u2013 nothing to write\nhome about.\nNarcissus Road is really a mixed\nThe Hoosiers\nWorst Case Scenario\n(Unknown)\nHH\u2729\u2729\u2729\nsingle review\nThe Hoosiers have a fucking ridiculous name and for that alone they\ndeserve no attention at all \u2013 quite\nwhy a London band has named\nthemselves after the native American name for Indiana, that or a\ndodgy American movie about small\ntown basket-ball is beyond me. The\nband itself sound like the hideous\nlove child of Ima Robot and Lilly Allen. Worst Case Scenario, a catchy\ndebut and if you are into happy-go-lucky indie-pop, then you will love\nthis.

What Would Steve Do? is a frantic mix of honest vocals and rhythm\nguitars. Unlike a lot of new bands,\nMumm-Ra knows their bounds and\nstay away from anything too pre-tentious, without faux American accents et al. Mumm-Ra clearly have\ntaken props from the likes of the\nLibertines, replacing all the twa-tish smack addictions with retro\npop-rock love which for some reason remind me of Love (although\nnot the same calibre). All this is a\ngood thing as Mumm-Ra are on the\nbill for the NME Awards Indie Rock\ntour, a guarantee that you will here\nplenty more of this band for a good\n6 months to come.\nNick Simpson\nsingle review\nand by the time the 2 minutes 55\ndraws to a close it is hard to remember anything from the song.

But when it is revealed that\nClaudius has been saved and is returning to Rome, the title character\u2019s best laid plans and ambitions\nare revealed for all to see and her\nresolve put to the test.\nIn David McVicar\u2019s production,\noriginally debuting in Brussels,\nthe tale is adapted to contemporary Britannia. It works well \u2013 the\ngames of power are now played out\nbetween corrupt politicians and officials in tailored suits, corporate\nvampires, and pseudo-WAGs vying\nfor their spot at the trough of indignity and fame.\nThe snapshot works well and influences from modern Britain are\nevident in the Enfieldesque brat\nNerone and the beautiful Poppea, a\ncrucial cornerstone in Agrippina\u2019s\nplans, who veers between Bridget\nJones and a Boujis debutante.\nIt all makes it readily accessible\nto the novice, and though the show\nweighs in at just under four hours,\nit never becomes tiresome, throwing up laughs, entertaining and ab-Hannibal Rising\nThomas Harris\nsorbing in equal measure.\nThe vocal performances are, on\nthe whole, dazzling. Though the\nshow has been criticised as being\na vehicle for the feted Sarah Connolly as the show\u2019s main character,\nthere is admirable depth across\nthe board. Connolly\u2019s Agrippina is\ncharismatic and wilful, and technically faultless.\nAs her son Nerone, Christine Rice\nsteals the show with a spine-tingling\nvocal performance matched by her\nsimilarly show-stealing cocaine-fuelled antics. But the real find was\nENO main stage first-timer Lucy\nCrowe as the pawn-turned-player\nPoppea \u2013 the audience\u2019s concentration was palpable every time she\ngraced the stage with her unrestrained vocal power.\nAnd not least, Daniel Reuss\ncontrolled the music admirably\nfrom the pit; Handel\u2019s electrifying\nscore was both mesmerising and\nelevating.\nThe script was sparkling and\nbright. Though crassly comical, it\nretained the essence and spirit of\nthe original while receiving a welcome infusion of profanity more in\nline with the rest of the production.\nIt wasn\u2019t subtle \u2013 but it was fun and\nthe show flowed easily between its\nvarious scenes and arias.\nBy striking the right balance between retaining traditional operatic\nintegrity and embracing modernity,\nMcVicar opens his arms to both au-diences. Opera has never been so\naccessible.\nDavid Paw\nENGLISH NATIONAL OPERA AND CLIVE BARDA\nHannibal Lecter\u2019s \u2018Memory Palace\u2019\nis the starting point for Thomas\nHarris\u2019s new novel Hannibal Rising. If you\u2019ve read any of the other\nbooks or seen the films, you\u2019ll be familiar with this concept, but here it\nis tired. Harris uses it to introduce\nyou to Hannibal the genius with a\nmuseum-like mind. Unfortunately,\nthis hackneyed beginning doesn\u2019t\nfade away; it only gets worse.\nWe first find little Lecter living in\na castle in Lithuania with his sister,\nnoble parents, and tutor to see to\nhis genius. It is the early 1930\u2019s and\ngreat flapping metaphors about\nblack swans of doom and his innocent sister abound. The Nazis are\ncoming, and the Russians, and in\nthe increasingly short chapters we\nare constantly reminded that they\nare, surprisingly, the bad guys.\nThe events of WWII carry the\nLecters away from their castle and\ninto hiding in the woods, there\u2019s lots\nof suffering caused by the baddies\n(Nazis), and a rather hurried conclusion where all of Lecter\u2019s family\nare killed \u2013 his sister in a gruesome\ncase of cannibalism: this is the part\nwhere you feel sorry for Lecter.\nAs fate would have it, the war\nends and our little orphan Lecter is\nlooked after in a Russian communist orphanage which, ironically, is\nsituated in the castle that belongs\nto him. Luckily noble painter Uncle Lecter comes to his rescue and\nsweeps him away to his chateau in\nFrance and to meet his mysterious\nJapanese aunt.\nThis introduction to Hannibal\u2019s\nteenage years is where I really began to dread reading more of the\nbook. Auntie Murasaki is the sum of\nevery Japanese cliche; icily beauti-ful, a whiz at haikus, and owner of\nterribly sharp swords. Yawn. Some\nrevenge ensues when the uncle\nfalls ill and Hannibal has to avenge\nhis Aunt\u2019s honour. Things get a little\nout of hand with the revenge, and\nHannibal becomes known to your\nstandard lone maverick policeman,\nInspector Popil. Yawn again. So,\nhim and Aunt move to Paris, where\nHannibal (he\u2019s a genius again) is\ntraining as a doctor.\nThe quiet life is not suited to Hannibal, however, as he\u2019s suddenly obsessed by elaborate revenge on the\nmen who destroyed his childhood.\nFrom here, it\u2019s all downhill. There\u2019s\nnone of the suspense of the earlier\nbooks and none of the interplay between Hannibal and his victims. We\ncan\u2019t sympathise with the crudely\ndrawn victims because they\u2019re evil\nex-Nazis and we can\u2019t sympathise\nwith Hannibal any more because\nhe\u2019s so cartoon-creepy.\nIf you\u2019re coming to Hannibal Rising having never seen any of the\nfilms or read the other books in the\nHannibal Lecter series, then you\nmight possibly enjoy some of the\ndrama, but even for pure trashy\nnovel enjoyment, there\u2019s not a\nlot to recommend. It\u2019s fairly obvious that Hannibal Lecter is now\npurely a cash cow for the author.\nPerhaps the film version suits the\ndumbing down of such a magnificent murderer more aptly, but I\u2019d\nrecommend giving both a miss and\nwatching The Silence of the Lambs\ninstead for a taste of what Hannibal\nthe cannibal is really about.\nMargaret Stewart\nBook\nReview\nIf Imperial made Arts Festivals ...\nThere\u2019s been something in the air\nthis week. It smells sweeter, sounds\nmore melodic, and everything looks\nthat little bit brighter. Yes, it\u2019s that\ntime of year again: ArtsFest week.\nFor all the first-years amongst\nyou, this is the week that Imperial\u2019s\nextensive collection of A&E (Arts\nand Ents) clubs showcase their talents and prove to us all that being\na scientist and having artistic/mu-sical talent are not mutually exclusive personality traits.\nArtsFest has been more prominent on campus this year than any\nother this reporter can recall; you\ncan hardly have failed to hear the\nbusking in SAF, Tanaka, and Sherfield, featuring some of Imperial\u2019s\nchoral and instrumental elite.\nArt has been well-covered too,\nwith PhotoSoc and LeoSoc exhibitions in the Blyth Gallery (that\u2019s\nSherfield Level 5), plus a retrospective of Imperial\u2019s artistic past in the\nMechEng Foyer.\nIt\u2019s not all been about showing off\ntalent. Workshops on Wednesday allowed students wanting to try their\nhands at drama, art, and dance.\nBut if you have missed seeing\nsome of what\u2019s been on offer, don\u2019t\ndespair (well, as long as you\u2019re\nreading this on Friday!) The Finale\nConcert is at 7:30 p.m. tonight in the\nGreat Hall, promising all the best\nfrom the week, including dancing,\nmusical performances, and mar-tial-arts demonstrations.\nEmily Lines\nREBECCA WARREN\n\n"

    "content": "CGCU Slave Auction raises \u00a31000\nThe Union President loses at arm wrestling (to a girl!) and Union officers are auctioned all in aid of charity\nThursday night saw this year\u2019s\nCGCU Slave Auction raise almost\n\u00a31000 for RAG from the auctioning\nof officers alone.\nMorethanhalfofthemoneyraised\nwas for John Collins to audition for\nthe X-Factor (see front page).\nThe first to be auctioned was the\nfetching MatSoc chair, Elly Jay, who\nwent for princely sum of \u00a310, to the\ndismay of RCS Motor Club, who had\nbeen looking for someone to polish\ntheir fire engine.\nFormer CGCU President and\nlong-time Union hack Siddarth\nSingh only went for \u00a311; a CGCU\nsource says this is because \u201che\u2019s\na little strange and quit difficult to\nshut up when you want some peace\nand quiet.\u201d\nSerial midget and misogynist\nJames Fok (current CGCU President) was bought by Ms Jay for the\nbargain price of \u00a39. She seemed\nrather pleased with her new toy.\nMore significant sums were\nraised by Luke Taylor, ex-ACC\nChair and Union bar legend. For\n\u00a345 and 50 euros (no, we don\u2019t know\nwhy either) he took on John Collins in a yard-drinking competition.\nHowever, Mr Taylor was seen to be\nof greater stature and build than\nthe ICU President, and hence allowed Mr Collins to drink a pint,\nrather than the yard (which is three\npints).\nMr Taylor then proceeded to\nmake the yard disappear in a matter of seconds, finishing it while Mr\nCollins was only halfway down his\npint.\nOther sabbs went for significantly\nless than Mr Collins; Dave Parry\nbought Jon Matthews (Deputy\nPresident, Finance & Services) for\n\u00a360; rumours abound that Mr Parry\nmay make his slave go out to dinner with Shama Rahman (see Felix passim). Ben \u201cFluffy\u201d Harris\n(Deputy President, Education &\nWelfare) raised only \u00a32 after being\nbought by the RCSU President, Jad\nMarrouche.\nMr Marrouche himself was sold\nfor a yard competition against\nJames Fok and the RSM Treasurer; surprisingly, Mr Fok beat\nthem both. Plans were afoot for a\ngladiator-style jousting match on\nbarstools, but both Mr Fok and Mr\nMarrouche were far too shaky after\nrapid consumption of three pints\nfor this to be an option.\nMr Collins took on two girls in an\narm-wrestling competition, only to\nlose to them both to his great em-barrassment. To this day, he claims\nthe young ladies cheated.\nThe event was marred when the\nGuilds managed to abscond with\nthe RAG mascot in revenge for\nRAG\u2019s theft of the Guilds decoy\nSpanner mascot.\nRAG Chair Stephen Brown is said\nto be \u201cf**king furious\u201d.\nSabb elections still\nnot a farce (yet)\nClockwise from top left: Elly Jay (Matsoc chair) with her new slave, James Fok (CGCU President), John\nCollins (President) gets beaten by a girl, and Fok and Collins suffer at the hands of the Hit Squad\nT. Monkey (thanks to Live!)\nRAG week ended on a high at the\nCity and Guilds College Union Slave\nAuction with Union President John\nCollins being bought by a consortium of his fellow sabbaticals, Felix\nstaff and people still bitter about\nhim leading us into the NUS for the\ntidy sum of \u00a3450. The current total\nraised for charity over the whole\nweek is still to be determined but\nthe RAG Chair has been overheard\nsaying \u201c\u00a33000 and counting\u201d.\nAs a slave, Collins is being requested to enter the X-Factor auditions to be held later this year. This\nannouncement was greeted with\ngreat amusement by patrons of the\nUnion Bar. However a somewhat\ncynical Mr. Collin\u2019s announced that\nit would only go ahead \u201conce he\nsees the money\u201d. As you can see\nfrom our photos, RAG duly obliged\nalthough Mr Collins insisted that\nthe coins be weighed first.\nThursday evening also saw the\ntraditional yard of ale race between\nthe Presidents of CGCU, RCSU and\nthe RSM. James Fok, CGCU President was the clear winner although\nthis was disputed by some spectators due to the large volume of ale\nwhich ended up being spilt on the\nfloor.\nThe author of this article was\nalso on the receiving end of a mischievous bid after 2 Guildsman\npurchased him to appear on Page\n3 wearing nothing but a kilt and a\nRAG t-shirt. Readers are warned\nthat a large degree of nakedness\nwill still be involved and may wish\nA round-up of RAG week\nto avert their gaze when it is published later in the term.\nDespite the excellent take at\ntheir Slave Auction, the clear winners of the interfaculty fundraising\n\u201ccompetition\u201d was the re-formed\nRCSU. Their tours of the Queens\nTower and RAG Lecturers Quiz\nproved particularly popular with\nstudents and a sum well over \u00a31000\nwas raised. The lecturers quiz was\na 3 way contest between a team of\n3 chemistry lecturers, 3 physics\nlecturers and the RCSU Executive\nCommittee. Jad Marrouche and\nhis RCSU all-stars duly triumphed,\nnarrowly beating the chemistry\nstaff after a tie-break.\nWinners of the London Raid for\nthe second year in a row was the\n\u201cCast of Casualty\u201d team who raised\n\u00a3835 in under 6 hours. This was almost 4 times the amount raised by\n\u201cWe Saw the Queen\u201d (they did, re-ally) with commuters and tourists\nclearly being impressed enough\nwith their outfits to hand over large\nsums of cash.\nPHOTOS COURTESY OF LIVE!\nStephen Brown\nRAG Chair\nRCSU President Jad Marrouche becomes the target of the Hit Squad\nThis year\u2019s sabbatical elections look\nto become rather interesting, with\nno position remaining uncontested.\nThere are now seven candidates\nstanding for President, including two current sabbatical offic-ers, compared to last week when\nthere were only four fully-seconded\ncandidates.\nThe position of Felix Editor had\nbeen uncontested until just before\nthe close of nominations, when two\nadditional candidates appeared.\nThere are both experienced and\nunexperienced candidates running\nfor many of the positions, including President, showing a greater\ninterest in the Union by the student\nbody than in previous years. At the\ncandidates meeting on Wednesday,\nICU President John Collins made a\npoint of trying to level the playing\nfield between \u2018hack\u2019 candidates and\nrelative newcomers.\nSee next week\u2019s Felix for manifestos of each candidate.\nI\u2019ve never seen such a crowded candidates meeting\n3\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Two decades, and still unfinished\nFrom Cactuars to Kupo \u2013 Michael Cook tells tales of great adventure as we look back on Final Fantasy\nW\nhilst I want to say\nthat old games\njournalism stand-ard, \u201cEveryone\nremembers their\nfirst time\u201d, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s\ntrue of Final Fantasy. So let me\nopen with something a bit different.\nEveryone \u2013 everyone \u2013 remembers\ntheir first random battle.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on? The\nscreen just smooshed. Yeah, I\nwas just running around, what\u2019s it\n\u2026 what\u2019s that. Is that me? That\u2019s\nme? But I was just walking around.\nThose people weren\u2019t even there.\nIs this a one-off?\u201d\nFor many people, it was a one-off, because they put Cloud, Squall,\nButtz, or whichever plucky FF hero\ndown and never went near one of\nthe bastards ever again. But for the\nrest of us, it was the first of many\nscreen smooshes. And that game\nwas the first of many fifty-hour\njourneys. And who cares if you\nthink VI is better than VII? Who\ncares if you didn\u2019t like the ending\nof IX? There\u2019s a certain link between each and every game, and\neach and every FF fan.\nIt\u2019salwaystherandombattlesthat\ndivides opinion over Squaresoft\u2019s\nhistoric line of turn-based, story-led\nRPG masterpieces. People could\nbear the plot, even if they found\nsome of it contrived. People could\nforgive it for not being as hardcore\nas the Western RPGs, grounded\nin D&D, D20, and Dungeons. But\nthe one thing you couldn\u2019t make\nyourself push through were those\ndarned monster encounters. You\neither loved them, or you left.\nWhen the game series launched\nin Japan back in the pre-3D days of\n1987, Dragon Quest was the big-hitteroftheday,developedbySquare\u2019s\nthen-rival studio Enix, and Square\nthemselves were on the brink of\nbankruptcy. The \u201cFinal\u201d Fantasy,\ndeveloped by Hironobu Sakaguchi,\nwas to be both Square and Sakaguchi-san\u2019s final game, earning itself one of the most ironic\ngame titles in the process.\nIronic because, as we all know,\nFinal Fantasy was not to be the end\nof Sakaguchi or Squaresoft. From\ntheir first tale of the Warriors of\nLight and the Elemental Crystals,\nall the way through to today\u2019s more\ncontemporary fantasy tales, the\nstrange yet unforgettable style of\neach game has made the franchise\na clean success from the get-go.\nWhy strange? Because the more\nyou see of Final Fantasy, the better you understand the\nthreads that Sakaguchi and his\ndevelopment\nteams wove\nthrough\neach and every one of the early\ninstallments. Certainly, the BigBird-esque Chocobo creatures,\nthe Cid character and so forth, are\nall examples of Final Fantasy\u2019s\nenduring regulars. But the plots\ncontain a lot of common themes,\nand nurtures a certain way of play-ing. After twenty years and twelve\nmain games \u2013 ignoring the many\nspinoffs \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take more than\na couple of Final Fantasies to make\nit a very different kind of gaming\nexperience.\nOne of the most impressive\nthings to come out of the series\nwas the way it penetrated the\nAmerican market. As the occasional FF got converted \u2013\nwith a confusing numbering\nsystem that differed from\nthe Japanese standard \u2013 the\nAmerican audience lapped\nit up more and more, until\neventually Square made the\nleap to a new generation of graphics and scale.\nI scorned Final Fantasy VII. I\nscorned everything on the Playstation that wasn\u2019t a platforming\ngame, so when the flags started\nwaving for some ridiculously-titled\nswords and magic game, I ignored\nit. I didn\u2019t need that then \u2013 I had\nOddworld.\nFinal Fantasy VII would represent a crucial jump for Square, as\nthey chose to leave Nintendo for\nthe first time to develop for Sony\u2019s\ndebut machine. Not only would it\nallow them to penetrate the Western market far deeper than previous conversions ever had, but it\nwould also give them a base in a\nrising star in the console war \u2013 a\nrelationship that would soon have\ntables turned on it, as Final Fantasy became one of the few stable\nlicenses for Sony\u2019s Playstation3.\nBut I was having none of it, and\nin fact it wasn\u2019t until Final Fantasy\nVIII, when I\u2019d mellowed out and\ndiscovered Metal Gear Solid and,\nwell, guns, that Final Fantasy began to appeal.\nVIII was, I like to tell myself, a different beast. Unlike VII\u2019s cartoonish stylings, VIII was a real game\nthat didn\u2019t talk down to you. It took\nthe gamer into a strange Harry Potter-meets-Gundam world, where\nteenagers trained to be mercenaries at obscurely cheery high\nschools called Gardens. And yes, I\nremember my first random battle.\nIt scared the crap out of me.\nOnce over the initial shock, and\nthe initial few confusing deaths,\nthe control system began to make\nsense. Waiting for each turn,\nchoosing a move from an ever-fill-ing list of spells, items and attacks,\ntrying to pre-empt enemy attacks.\n24 felix Friday 16 February 2007\nGAMES felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "etters to the Editor\nA response to\nthe gay adoption\narticle\nNaked people and homosexuality\nA Catholic defends against the claim that Christians are homophobic, and a previous centrefold model\ntakes issue with being called \u201cnot conventionally beautiful\u201d\nSir,\nIn Felix #1,372, an article (\u201cGay\nAdoption \u2013 Where\u2019s the Crime?\u201d)\nraised some interesting issues. I\nwould like to address some of the\nquestions raised in the (apparently\nanonymous) article.\nThe first misconception is that\nChristians are homophobic: this\ncould not be further from the truth.\nEven the Catholic church does not\n\u201ccondemn\u201d gays because of their\nsexual inclination. The main problem is that, after much research,\nthe Church believes that homosexual relationships tend to be very\nunstable. The Catholic adoption\nagencies would not place a child in\nthe care of any couple that is likely\nto split up, be it same-sex or other-wise. They would probably also look\nat more important criteria than\nwhether or not the couple \u201cdrink\nStella Artois\u201d and have \u201conly one\nGeography GCSE between them\u201d,\nbut that\u2019s another matter.\nThe comment that Holy scripture was written \u201cseveral hundred\nyears after\u201d the lives of Jesus and\nMohammed is clearly misguided. I\nam not qualified to write about Islam, but in the Christian case, Bible\nscholars have dated the synoptic\ngospels (Mark, then Matthew and\nLuke) to only thirty to forty years\nafter Jesus\u2019 death, while St. John\u2019s\ngospel is thought to have been committed to paper sixty years later.\nThe epistles were written even ear-lier, as was the quella, a text common to St. Luke\u2019s and St. Matthew\u2019s\ngospels. Of all writings from antiq-uity, dating techniques show that\nthe New Testament is the most au-thentic, and closest to the original\n(these techniques are quite compli-cated, and I wouldn\u2019t like to go into\ndetails here).\nFinally, dismissing religion as\n\u201cfairytales\u201d is rash and somewhat\nill thought out. As a Catholic, I see\nplenty of evidence for the existence\nof God, or at least the \u201csupernatural\u201d, if only from a \u201cDives and Lazarus\u201d point of view. As a scientist,\nI see little to either prove or disprove the existence of God. I would\nsuggest that religion is at least as\nplausible as, say, quantum mechanics or the Higgs mechanism. This\nworld is a very complex place, and\nso much of what we \u201cknow\u201d to be\ntrue can come unstitched without\nmuch effort (as anyone who has\ndone a physics degree can tell you).\nThe author has clearly made his de-cision, and that is to be respected,\nbut he should show respect for other people\u2019s beliefs in return.\nI agree that the church does\nseem to be discriminating against\nhomosexuals, but there is something deeper in the story that has\nemerged over recent weeks. It\nis alarming that the government\nthinks it can dictate the moral\nstandards of this country. Do we\nreally think that the people who\nsupported the war in Iraq, and who\nwish to renew Trident, are right to\nmake moral decisions for us in our\nevery day lives? The truth is, I am\nworried that this may only be the\nstart of government interference\nin people\u2019s spiritual life and moral\ndecisions.\nI would add that I have nothing\nagainst homosexuals; Jesus calls\nfor us to love everyone to the best\nof our ability, and I have nothing but\nrespect for gays. I hope that this\nletter has been informative, and not\noffensive in anyway.\nAndy,\nI wonder whether you\u2019d like to explain your meaning behind the\nphrase \u201cnot \u2018conventionally\u2019 beautiful\u201d to me in a little more depth?\nMy appearance has been described\nas everything from handsome to a\nbin liner full of custard but never\nin what appears to be a euphemistic and thinly veiled jibe -- and certainly neither Kat nor I have never\nas an example of someone who is\nunattractive, for any purpose.\nIf you want my take on page 3 in\ngeneral, I think it is a good piece of\nfun that shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously either way \u2013 either to mock\nthe porn industry or to replicate it.\nWomen as it happens are no more\n\u201csexualised\u201d (if that is an adverb!)\nthan men, viz. Brad Pitt, George\nClooney, Jude Law etc. It is my\nAndy Sykes replies,\nThe only real issue that the article\nraised was that adoption cases\nshould be considered on an individual basis, whether they come\nfrom hetero- or homosexual cou-ples; sadly, you have failed to grasp\nor address that point in your reply,\ninstead reacting against the manner in which the author expressed\nhis views.\nIndeed, the likelihood of a couple\nsplitting up ought to be the crucial factor in deciding whether to\nplace a child in that couple\u2019s care.\nHowever, you deny the eligibily of\nsame-sex couples by alleging that\ntheir relationships \u2018tend to be very\nunstable\u2019 without adducing any\nrelevant evidence. Even if there\nwere such evidence, as a scien-tist, you should know better that to\nconclude from it that all same-sex\nrelationships are therefore unsta-ble. So why should adoption cases\nnot be considered on individual\nmerit, especially if the Church\nhas nothing against gays, as you\nmaintain?\nThe closing couple of paragraphs\nof your letter seem to offer a point-er. Your worry about the government\u2019s dictating moral stardards\nwould appear to imply that you\nconsider adoption by homosexual\ncouple immoral. This belies your\nrepeated denial of homophobic\nsentiments within the Christian\ncommunity (which at any rate is\nextremely hard to take seriously)\nand shows how you actually feel\nabout such couples.\nHaving \u2018nothing against\u2019 and \u2018not\ncondemning\u2019 publicly are, alas, not\nthe same as respecting and treating with due justice.\nAlso, I very much doubt that Jesus qualified his teachings with\nphrases such as \u2018to the best of one\u2019s\nability\u2019.\nWhat do you\nmean, not\n\u2018conventionally\nbeautiful\u2019?\nAndy Sykes replies,\nAll I meant, sir, is that you are not\nthe classic Adonis \u2013 you know the\ntype. You are not 6\u2019 4\u201d, tanned, and\nincredibly muscular. It was not\nmeant to imply your looks were,\nas you say, akin to a binliner full\nof custard.\nI agree with your points about\npage 3, especially about the \u2018purpose\u2019 of porn. I do remember reading an article in a friend\u2019s psychology magazine that proclaimed\nthat mordern internet pornography was creating a generation of\nyoung people who had a morbid\nfear of pubic hair.\nbelief that both men and women\nshould be aware of what each other\nlook like before entering into a relationship with one, let alone get mar-ried, and in this role the porn industry has a bearing though clearly\na good deal of what is available is\nunlikely to be justifiable under that\ncriterion alone.\nI look forward to your response.\nSamuel Furse\nThe Bible \u2013 condemns homosexual relationships\nL\n7\nfelix\nFriday 16 February 2007\n\n"
