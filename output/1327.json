    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nPurple is a stylishly decorated venue\nlocated in or around the Chelsea\nVillage complex. I say in or around,\nsince as a non-football fan I\u2019m not\nsure. It\u2019s close by anyway, and as\nsuch easy to find.\nThis really isn\u2019t the kind of place\nI go to very often. To me it\u2019s not a\nclub, it\u2019s a drinking house. Usually\nI resent being charged entrance to\na place with an overcrowded bar,\noverpriced drinks and uninspiring\nmusic, but tonight I was with friends\nso got dragged along. Actually it\nisn\u2019t as bad as all that.\nInside it does look pretty classy,\nwith a video screen, drapes and\nfloors on different levels. The place\nboasts an \u2018exclusive VIP area\u2019 (read:\n\u2018roped off part of the club\u2019), as well\nas podiums, a DJ box tucked right\nout of the way, a fair amount of\nseating and only one bar (that I\nsaw).\nI\u2019m told that at the weekends\nyou can\u2019t get in, presumably unless\nyou\u2019re a footballer or a wannabe footballer\u2019s wife/plaything. The crowd\ntonight was pretty young, since it\nwas student (cheaper) night, and\ngenerally pretty. A mate advised me\nthat most of the ladies were looking\nto pull rich guys, but on that I really\ncouldn\u2019t comment.\nThe solitary bar was really\nrammed \u2013 about ten deep \u2013 and it\ntook quite a while to get served,\nduring which time I had to put up\nwith drunken dahlings squeezing,\nrubbing and grinding against me.\nIt sounds much more pleasant than\nit was. I have to give credit to the\nbar staff \u2013 fair, efficient and friendly,\nand on their advice I got four drinks\nwhich sorted me out for the night\n(only until about 1.30am). And four\nvodka red bulls for a tenner isn\u2019t\ntoo bad.\nUsually at these types of clubs, the\nmusic depresses the hell out of me,\nbut tonight I really was pleasantly\nsurprised. It was mostly a mixture\nof hip hop and R&B, including some\nJurassic 5, and there was nothing\nI heard that\u2019d I\u2019d really call shit. I\nhave to give the DJ large amounts\nof respect for dropping about half a\ndozen tracks that I really like (and\nactually sang along to), plus the fact\nthat he could mix and he did mash\nit up a bit.\nGiven what this place is (and\nmy usual disinclination for such\nestablishments) I was genuinely\nimpressed. I\u2019m surprising even\nmyself here by saying that I\u2019d come\nback to Purple \u2013 I reckon it\u2019d be\na good place to go post-pub on a\nThursday, to warm up for a \u2018real\u2019\nclub later. Simon Clark\nFESTIVAL REVIEW\nHomelands, or in full, \u2018We Love...\nHomelands\u2019, has been running for\nover five years, and in that time has\nbuilt up a reputation for being one\nof the best dance festivals and the\nopener of the season.\nThe deal with dance festivals is\nslightly different to the rest, being\nheld over one (very long) day and\nthrough the night until the next\nmorning. That said, some promoters do run weekenders at holiday\ncamps, and Godskitchen\u2019s \u2018Global\nGathering\u2019 event at the end of July\nis this year spreading the mayhem\nacross two days.\nWhen I first saw the lineup for\nHomelands 2005, with around 80\nacts and DJs across ten separate\nareas, I was literally drooling. It\nwas as if the organisers had been\nwatching me to find out all the DJs\nI rate or have enjoyed over the past\ncouple of years so they could book\nthem all. I couldn\u2019t have forgiven\nmyself for missing out on this, so\nbooked up my ticket nice and early\nto avoid disappointment and provide\nme with some light at the end of the\ncold, dank tunnel that is final year\nexams.\nThe event started at 12.30pm, with\nlive acts such as Babyshambles,\nAudio Bullys and even the likes of\nThe Bravery and Beck there to provide early entertainment before the\nonslaught into the night. We tried to\nget the as early as we could, we really did, but events conspired against\nus \u2013 engineering works on the trains,\nand a bus replacement driven by a\nproper chump who took us past the\nsite and on into Winchester.\nFrom the road we had trek up\na hill and then past Operation\nCheesefoot. Operation Cheesefoot?\nAllow me to elaborate. Hampshire\nConstabulary were having a day out\nas well, and they\u2019d brought their\nsniffer dogs with them. Before even\ngetting to the entrance to the arena,\nwe all had to file past this lot. There\nwere a lot of very nervous clubbers,\nand rightly so \u2013 the police were pulling so many people that there was\na queue of delinquents outside the\npolice tent, all waiting to be \u2018examined\u2019.\nAt events like this, drugs are\nalmost inevitable, but the police\nclearly didn\u2019t want to give that\nimpression. I read later that they\nmade about a dozen arrests, but\nfrom what I heard from fellow revellers most people got away with having their stashes and tickets confiscated (though more were on sale)\nand an informal caution.\nThe location, the Matterley Bowl\n(a natural dip in the Hampshire\ncountryside), was perfect. All you\ncan see around you are hills and\ntrees, and I doubt any noise from\nthe site gets very far. By the time\nwe\u2019d got inside, it was actually pretty late. The sun was dipping, and I\njust caught the gruff tones of Roots\nMavuna finishing his set in the live\narena with Witness.\nHaving got some cider down my\nneck and done a bit of exploring,\nit was time to assess the situation.\nSadly I\u2019d already missed a few good\nacts, but the night was still young.\nWe enjoyed some of Steve Lawler\u2019s\nchug-chug beats at the outdoor\nstage, before heading into Arena 1\nto catch Digweed. Playing a typically stalwart set, he picked us all up.\nOne strange thing to note about\nthe layout of the arena is that, since\nit\u2019s in a bowl, there\u2019s a slope up\ntowards the stages. Whilst this\ndid keep the crowds from getting\npacked, it made it a little difficult to\nkeep an even footing. After Digweed,\nwe hung around to check out Richie\nHawtin (aka Plastikman). His style\nof minimal techno is tight, subtle\nand deep. Next generation technology give this man a very special edge.\nOne of my mates tried to drag me\nelsewhere, but I was staying put.\nBy midnight, things were on a roll\nand we spent the rest of the night\nmoving between the different arenas (some of which looked way too\nsimilar, depsite being totally different sizes), losing then finding each\nother, and talking to other party\npeople.\nBy 5.30, when Danny Howells was\nrounding up the event, we had all\nover-exerted ourselves somewhat\nand made a start on getting back.\nThe train was a sight to behold \u2013 all\nthe seats and passageways were full\nof messed-up, danced-out ravers,\nsnuggling, sleeping and drooling on\none another. Bless.\nDespite taking ages to get to, and a\nfair bit more than the usual amount\nof random shit occuring, Homelands\nwas most definitely a cracker.\nSummer is here, and if Homelands\nwas anything to go by, it\u2019s going to\nbe great. Simon Clark\nNightlife Editor\nHomelands: festival season arrives\nHomelands is just about the first festival of the summer. Given that they\u2019d booked just\nabout every DJ in the world, it would have been rude not to go...\nBarney: big, purple, throbbing\nWe Love...

That\u2019s\nonly really relevant here because\nwe\u2019ve come to the end. This is the\nlast Nightlife of the year, and my last\nas editor of this page.\nWhilst I\u2019m not really sure how\nmany of you read this stuff (the\npoor fools, they really don\u2019t know\nwhat they\u2019re missing), I hope you\u2019ve\nenjoyed reading as much as I\u2019ve\nenjoyed writing. It\u2019s really been\nquite a giggle partying down in the\nname of good journalism \u2013 hopefully\nI\u2019ve helped you plan your nights\nout, entertained you a little, or at\nthe very least helped you understand why so many of us (if not that\nmany Imperial kids) like to spend\nour weekends bouncing around dark\nrooms listening to strange, repetitive electronic music.\nI started the year with a festival\n\u2013 the sundrenched South West Four\non Clapham Common \u2013 and I\u2019m\nending it with one. Homelands was\nwicked, even if there\u2019s some stuff\nI haven\u2019t printed (I\u2019ll tell you when\nyou\u2019re old enough).\nThe passing of Homelands means\nit\u2019s festival time again. Woo! As\nusual, there\u2019s tons going on over\nthe summer. If I could make it I\u2019d\nbe well up for Godskitchen\u2019s Global\nGathering \u2013 they\u2019re doing it over two\nnights this year. If you\u2019re anything\nlike me, you\u2019ll be thinking \u201cGod,\nthat\u2019s going to be messy...\u201d\nI\u2019d like to take this opportunity\nto thank the few reviewers who\u2019ve\nmade my life easier and made these\npages less of a personal journal by\ngoing out and telling us about it. I\nalso want to give a shout out to my\nmate Hasan, who\u2019s been my clubbing buddy since first year, without\nwhom I wouldn\u2019t have been to half\nthe places I have, and I wouldn\u2019t\nhave got so trashed. And we couldn\u2019t\nhave that, now could we?\nAside from that, I don\u2019t really have\nmuch to say. At the time of writing\nthere is no Nightlife editor for next\nyear, so if you fancy filling some\npages with whatever happens to be\nfloating through your head at the\ntime... I mean, if you want to become\na serious and respected journalist,\ndrop us a line at felix@ic.ac.uk and\nyou could be sitting here writing this\nnext year. It\u2019s well worth it \u2013 having\nmedia power means that virtually\nevery club in the capital will gladly\nput you on their VIP list so you can\nsplurge about them. Also, with the\npower comes fame, fortune and fine\nwomen falling at your feet*.\nSo that\u2019s it. Piss off now, leave me\nalone. Enjoy your summer. Work like\nyou don\u2019t need the money. Love like\nyou\u2019ve never been hurt. Dance like\nno-one\u2019s watching. See you in front\nof the speakers. Simon Clark\n(soon to be former) Nightlife Editor\n* None of these things are true.\nEspecially the women, this is\nImperial dammit.\nWe need a NIGHTLIFE EDITOR and CLUB REVIEWERS for next year!

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 16 June 2005\n10\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe joy of... columns\nFeeling the sand\nbeneath your feet?\nIt\u2019s not long now until all you guys will\nbe off for a nice long summer break.\nOf course, some of you will be off for\ngood, and perhaps others are hanging around to work academically or to\nearn some extra money.\nThis has been my first academic\nyear at Imperial as the adviser and\nI can honestly say it has been one\nof the most interesting and challenging years that I\u2019ve experienced.\nThe Information and Advice Centre\n(IAC) has dealt with a multitude of\nissues including all the classic things\nsuch as housing, finance and academic issues, and some unusual queries\nas well.\nIn Felix we have covered all sorts of\nsubjects. It can be quite challenging\ntrying to think of something to write\nabout week after week, so I thought I\nwould use my last column of the year\nto let you know how you can use our\nservices over the summer period.\nMany people think that some services in the Union close down over the\nholidays. The IAC doesn\u2019t close \u2013 we\nare still here to help you with all your\nwelfare needs and we will be running a full service over the summer\nperiod.\nWe will be available for advice in\nall areas, including housing rights,\nemployment rights, consumer rights,\ndebt advice, academic appeals, complaints and international student\nissues. We will also still be here as a\npoint of contact for all information in\nthe College.\nOver the summer, we are also\nreviewing our leaflets and publications and will be producing two new\nbooklets for the new term \u2013 one on\nmoney management, and an international students\u2019 welcome guide. We\nare currently in negotiations with the\nCollege to produce these together.\nIn the summer, many students\nchoose to work full time to supplement\ntheir finances. Sometimes, unfortu-nately, companies try to take students\nfor granted and treat them unfairly.\nIf this happens to you, the IAC can\nadvise you on your statutory rights\nat work and can write letters to these\nemployers on your behalf.\nOver the summer we also get a lot of\nacademic appeals, so we are going to\nproduce an information sheet which\ntalks students through the process.\nWe also be available to assist any student who believes they have a case to\nlaunch an academic appeal.\nWhatever all you students out there\nhave got planned, I would just like\nto wish you all the best of luck, especially those who are going off into the\nbig wide world. I hope that all your\ndreams come true.\nI would like to thank Dave Edwards\nfor giving me this column in Felix and\nfor being a supporter of the cause\nthroughout the year. I would also like\nto wish those leaving the Executive\nCommittee good luck for the future\nand thanks for your support.\nRemember: don\u2019t let your concern\nturn into a crisis. Make the IAC your\none stop shop for all your welfare\nissues. If you would like to contact\nus, please call 020 7594 8067 or email\nadvice@imperial.ac.uk.\nHave a great summer!\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nWell, having contributed to this\nesteemed organ more than a dozen\ntimes throughout the year, this is it\n\u2013 my last column. I\u2019m quite sad really...\nin more ways than one.\nAccommodation\nIt was my birthday on Tuesday, and I\nwas stuck at work, busy interviewing\nwardens for the new halls which are\nbeing opened to replace the capacity\nlost by the demolition of Southside.\nNow that\u2019s been an interesting project,\nand not without its controversies\neither! Needless to say, I don\u2019t want\nto reopen any cans of worms (since\nMustafa seems able enough at that),\nbut I am glad that the College is finally\ngetting round to sorting out a hall of\nresidence which is ceasing to operate\nas it should. I don\u2019t say that without\naffection for the place though, since I\nlived there for three years; I think we\nshould all give the hall, and the bar,\na good send-off, and look forward to\nushering in the new.\nAccommodation has probably been\none of the more interesting (and contentious at times) areas of my job. I\nhave enjoyed being involved in the\nselection of new wardens and sub-wardens, and firmly believe that the\nquality of pastoral care that freshers\nreceive in our halls easily outstrips\nthe competition from other universi-ties. So well done to the wardens for\nthat! I have been quite busy working\nwith Residences to develop a good\nexit survey, so that we can improve the\nprovision of accommodation to future\ngenerations of students.\nPatience\nIt always seems to be future generations who benefit from our labours. A\nturning point in my job was when I\nstopped expecting instant results and\nrecognised that many of the things I\nwas working on would not benefit the\nstudent body until future years. Once\nI realised that, my frustration diminished and my enthusiasm increased.\nI guess that\u2019s one reason why colleagues of mine have decided to stand\nfor sabbatical positions for a second\nyear, so that they can see through the\nwork they\u2019ve started.\nSome things I\u2019ve been involved in,\nsuch as the Strategic Review and\nthe QAA Audit, may take quite a few\nyears to manifest themselves. I think\nit would be quite interesting to come\nback in ten years\u2019 time to see the\ntransformation to Princes Gardens\nand the Union Building. Hopefully I\u2019ll\nhave better things to do.\nYour Union\nWe\u2019ve said it countless times before,\nbut this is your Union, and you should\nuse it as such. You should take the\nopportunities which are available to\nmake your views known. You could\nalways stand to serve on a commit-tee, or Council. You could vote! Why\nam I telling you all this now, at the\nend of the year? Maybe you haven\u2019t\nbeen involved in the Union or one of\nits clubs and societies this year... you\ncould reflect over the summer about\nwhat you want to get out of your student experience, since you only get\none shot at it. Why not come to the\nSummer Ball on Saturday? And yes,\nthat was a cheap plug.\nAnd finally\u2026\nAs I said before, this is my last column.\nIt\u2019s been a pleasure working for you,\nand with you, if you are a fellow officer\nor member of College or Union staff.\nI\u2019ve had a great year. Enjoy the sum-mer, and don\u2019t get sunburnt.\nSaving Southside: location,\nlocation, location\nL\ness space in the new Southside building means no room\nfor a new Southside Bar. Campaigners have already made\nsignificant progress in persuading the authorities that there\nis enough demand for a new bar, but on a campus where there is\nalready intense demand for space, the problem of finding a location\nhas proved a major difficulty.\nNow, however, it appears that a suitable spot in South Kensington\nmay have been found. Whilst we would not wish to \u2018jinx\u2019 the process by revealing the location or saying that the deal is done, we are\noptimistic that students\u2019 efforts in campaigning for a new bar will be\nrewarded soon.\nVisit www.felixonline.co.uk in the coming weeks for further developments on this and other stories.\nBeit redevelopment is long\noverdue\nI\nmperial College is ranked in the top four UK universities and the\ntop 15 in the world. From next year, many of its students will be\npaying \u00a33000 per year in tuition fees, while those from overseas\nwill pay well over \u00a310,000. A students\u2019 union with good social and\nrecreational facilities is essential to building a vibrant university\ncommunity in which students can both learn and enjoy themselves.\nFor all these reasons and more, the outdated facilities in Beit Quad\nmust be redeveloped and brought into the 21st century.\nThe exact specifics of the redevelopment are to be considered over\nthe coming months. All students should be encouraged to find out\nmore and submit feedback via the Union website \u2013 not only because\ntheir views are important, but also so that they know they are part\nof the process.\nIt is crucial that Imperial College Union provides facilities that are\nuseful and events that are appealing, all together in a building that\nits students can be proud of. If the Union is confident, dedicated to\nthe task and willing to make big changes \u2013 and if the College can\nbe persuaded to part with the cash \u2013 then there is no reason why\nour Union building cannot become the envy of the rest of the higher\neducation world.\nTransport trouble could cut\nstudent activity\nI\nt is totally understandable that each section of the Imperial\nCollege community must lose parking spaces during the Southside\nrebuilding project, when 98 spaces will be out of use. But how can\nit be fair that departments and faculties face cuts of around one third\nwhen Imperial College Union faces a 60% reduction?\nStudent activities at Imperial depend on transport to a large extent,\nespecially considering the central London location of the main cam-pus. The Union\u2019s minibuses are frequently used, most often by sports\nteams, and their relocation will cause considerable delay and inconvenience to club members in their already busy schedules.\nExtra-curricular activities produce well-rounded, employable stu-dents. Without sufficient transport, participation will become far\nmore difficult. Unfortunately, it would seem that the College does not\nrealise how important these activities are.\nJoin us next time\nT\nhe next issue of Felix will be published in late September. Any\ncomments, questions or contributions should be directed to the\nusual address: felix@ic.ac.uk.\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nUNCLE SAM\n\n"

Sound\ngood to you? Dan Snaith\u2019s newly-monikered Caribou (n\u00e9e Manitoba) doesn\u2019t disappoint\n21\nALBUM REVIEW\nThe story so far: Dan Snaith, a\ngood friend of Mr Keiran Hebden\n(aka Four Tet), and key member of\nHebden\u2019s first band, Fridge, used\nto be called Manitoba. His second\nrecord, Up In Flames, was a storming blend of sixties psych, glitchy\nIDM, and sunny shoegaze melodies,\nand was lauded by many as one of\nbest records of 2003. Since a minor\nconfrontation with an old punk\nsinger, Handsome Dick Manitoba\n(heard any of his records? No? Nor\nhave I), who tried to claim Snaith\nwas infringing his image, he simply\npicked another Canadian placename\nrather than fight.\nSo, Caribou is Manitoba. As anyone\nwho has heard both Up In Flames\nand Start Breaking My Heart (his\ndebut) will attest, Snaith\u2019s sound\nchanged massively in the two years\nthat separated them \u2013 the latter is\na mixture of pastoral electronica\nand stoned beats, while the former\nis a bombastic, rapturous affair. In\nfact, you can barely tell they\u2019re the\nproduct of the same artist. Many\nhave speculated over what the next\nstep would be; more tripped out\nshoegaze? More sixties references?\nHiphop beats? The answer, I can\nnow tell you, is all of these.\nThe Milk Of Human Kindness\nbuzzes with the same sunny, trippy\nfeel that made Up In Flames so\nappealing. The opener, Yeti, jogs\nalong on a wall of distorted acoustic guitars (a previous trademark),\nwith Snaith\u2019s vocals higher in the\nmix than they\u2019ve ever been before.\nHis voice, shorn of warping and\ndelay, is childlike and inviting: \u201cHis\ngreasy fingers strum together / and\nstretching \u2018cross the sky\u201d. Utterly\nnonsensical, but the vocal line is so\ncatchy you\u2019ll find yourself singing\nit for days afterwards. A sublimely\nfunky Rhodes line brings in a set of\ncymbal-heavy jazz fills that\u2019ll have\nthe inner drummer in you pounding\nthe desk with pencils, pens, mugs,\nand anything nearby. I\u2019m not kidding\n\u2013 live, two drummers at the front\nof the stage pretty much destroyed\ntheir kits with complex breaks and\nfills.\nBrahminy Kite demonstrates\nhow superb Snaith\u2019s production has\nbecome. Whereas on Up In Flames,\ncertain components of the mix would\nsound like they were clipping in his\neffort to create such an engrossing\nwall of sound, now he knows exactly\nhow and where to place the instruments within the mix for maximum\neffect. The shuffling, jazzy beats that\nopen the track are joined by a sumptuous flute harmony that makes a\nhuge grin spread across my face.\nBees showcases the additional sixties influence \u2013 the laidback cool of\nits opening riff is completely famil-iar, like it\u2019s been plucked out of that\nether that the best pop songs seem\nto exist in. Snaith builds a shell of\nwarm horn sounds, tremolo violins\nand police sirens over an ascending melody, before bringing out his\ntrademark jazz breaks. Rather than\nallow the song to explode into a\nmelodic cacophony, the drums are\nreigned in and a gentle horn swell\nbrings the song to an unusually\nrestrained ending.\nAfter the brief noise-attack of\nHands First, Hello Hammerheads\ncomes out of the blue, completely\nunheralded by anything Snaith has\ndone before. Over a pair of gently\npicked acoustic guitars and Simon\n& Garfunkel vocals, he produces a\nspectrally pretty tale of girl trouble,\nhumming a lilting melody over the\nbeautiful chorus.\nOh yes, the hiphop beats. Lord\nLeopard, with its shout-sampling,\ntight snare beats and sinister piano\nsound, sounds almost like something RZA would turn out. Pelican\nNarrows, the other instru-hop track,\nsounds like an RJD2 outtake \u2013 the\nfilmic piano line and tense strings\nride a big, fat, vintage-sounding\ndrum loop. The breakdown even\nfeatures a harpsichord.\nI know I always try to pick out\na high point from a record, but in\nthis case it\u2019s almost impossible. I\nhaven\u2019t even mentioned the continually shifting A Final Warning and its\n\u201cahhhhhh\u201d guitars, or the effortlessly superb freakout that is Barnowl\n(well, OK, I have now). Put simply,\nthis is the perfect soundtrack to the\nsummer \u2013 play it loud and outdoors.\nAndrew Sykes\nMusic Editor\nCaribou: \u201cI can, like, play two keyboards. In an animal mask\u201d\nCaribou\nThe Milk Of Human Kindness\n(Domino)\nHHHHH\nFEATURE\nIt wasn\u2019t the easiest of times for\nsinger songwriter Keiran Scragg,\naka Iko, when his old band Buffseeds\ndissolved at Christmas time. He\nwent from playing gigs in New York\nto working in a factory during six\nmonths of intense writer\u2019s block.\nLuckily for us, inspiration struck\nand he headed back to the studio\nwith Buffseeds keyboardist Neil and\nguitarist Rob to start recording the\nsongs he had lovingly penned on an\nacoustic guitar in his bedroom.\nThe title of the album, I Am Zero,\nis the title of a painting by his father\nthat tries to capture a perfect, emo-tionless state. This spoke loudly to\nhis, at the time, depressed son, and\nthe songs started to flow. The album\nitself is musically uplifting, but lyrically often mournful and longing,\nthe combined effect painting a picture of the hope on the other side of\nlove and loss.\nAll of the songs are obviously\nextremely personal, yet Keiran was\nadverse to the idea of the album\nbecoming like an autobiography. \u201cI\nwas looking on the net a lot, and\nbecame fascinated with the idea\nthat Artificial Intelligence could\ndevelop feelings of love\u201d, he says.\n\u201cYet this love would be extremely\ndetached\u201d.\nThis idea of emotional detachment\nis used in several ways throughout I\nAm Zero. Many of the songs are\nsung in character, so he is talking\nabout himself in the third person.\nAlso, the idea of Iko is that it is\na singer songwriter with a band,\nso Keiran is Iko (compare to say\nAqualung, the name he personally\nrecords under and the name of his\nband). This alternative persona\nallows him to remove himself from\npersonal memories of loss and sad-ness.\nThe first track, Lovestruck, gives\nyou a good feel for the rest of the\nalbum. Built up from light drums,\nacoustic guitar, synth strings and\ncello, it is extremely upbeat. The\nsong deals with the idea of impending disaster: \u201cIceberg ahead / look\naway, look away\u201d. Keiran admits\nit also references the Christmas\nTsunami disaster, and of \u201clife slipping away from under you\u201d.\nIn a similar vein, Hologram is\ninspired by September 11th\n(\u201cBuilding fall down\u201d) and the\nbreaching of America\u2019s supreme\nconfidence (\u201cDoes anyone here\nknow a Superman?\u201d). A trip to\nGround Zero had a profound effect\non the band: \u201cit\u2019s just such a large\nspace, and completely silent. Nobody\nmakes a noise, or beeps a horn.\nHologram is about the confusion\nand anger surrounding that event\u201d.\nNova has a different sound to the\nrest of the album, in the fact that it\nhas much more of a whole-band feel,\nwith electric guitar and screaming\norgan. In two of the verses Keiran\u2019s\nvoice is distorted to great effect\n(think of Matt Bellamy from Muse\nscreaming through a megaphone\nin Feeling Good). It highlights the\ntheme of love and loss, with lyrics\nlike \u201cDon\u2019t shut me down / keep me\nalive\u201d mixed with \u201cYou\u2019re the one\nmy soul craves\u201d.\nMusically I Am Zero tends to\nswing between feel-good, upbeat\ntracks (Lovestruck, All Time Low)\nand touching, ethereal love songs.\nNumbers is ghostly and tender, with\nsimple picked guitar and Keiran\u2019s\nvocals layered on top of themselves.\nIt breaks to just his voice at one\npoint, and the use of that often-overlooked musical device: silence,\nis spine-tingling. Damage Report\n(Hymn at Deaths Door) is possibly the most beautiful moment\non the album. Consisting of lightly\nstrummed guitar and soft electric\norgan, it does indeed almost sound\nlike a hymn. Keiran\u2019s vocals are\nat their best. It really tugs at you\nwhen he sings, \u201cThe final curtain\nhas fallen on me,\u201d and just lets his\nvoice crack and fade out.\nIko are planning to release the\nalbum as soon as they can on the\ninternet, and to press, hopefully\nsecuring a record deal. This process will involve touring, which you\ncan initially expect to be in London\nand Exeter (where they are based).\nFriend Justin will join them on bass,\nand Rob will take on drum duties.\nThey may even take a cellist! These\nare gigs well worth your money,\nsince this kind of honest and emotive song writing can never go out of\nfashion. A soundtrack to your life.\nJames Millen\nFrom the ashes\nBuffseeds, one of the least-appreciated indie bands England ever produced, sadly\ndissolved last year, but singer Keiran Scragg wasn\u2019t ready to quit\nBuffseeds: now sadly defunct\nIko\n(ex-Buffseeds)\nI Am Zero\n\n"

After 29 issues, 700\npages and something like three\nquarters of a million words, the\nFelix year comes to an end.\nI first wrote for Felix back in 2000,\n142 issues ago, and I\u2019m pleased\nto have been a regular contributor ever since. The newspaper has\nbeen a big part of my life and I\u2019m\ngoing to miss it. Working here has\ntaught me a huge amount, not only\nabout putting publications together,\nbut also about managing teams,\nunderstanding Union politics and\nstaying up until stupid hours of the\nmorning.\nI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve achieved\nwith Felix this year. We made a\nlot of changes, most notably the\nchange from magazine to newsprint\nwhich could have backfired hor-ribly, but I think we\u2019ve been suc-cessful. I believe Felix has become\na well-respected, well-written\nand well-read student newspaper.\nPreliminary results from our survey\nsuggest that you agree.\nEveryone here is pleased to have\nbeen given the President\u2019s Award\n\u2013 it\u2019s an honour to be singled out of\nImperial\u2019s 250 fantastic student-run\nclubs and societies.\nI would like to thank every single\nperson who has contributed to Felix\nin any way over the past year. The\nnewspaper could not exist without\nthe time, effort and enthusiasm of\nour excellent team of volunteers.\nThere is no way I can list them all,\nbecause there are too many, but\nI must mention my eight regular\nsection editors \u2013 Numaan, Darius,\nAndy, Simon, Paola, Martin, Alan\nand Shaun \u2013 who were a pleasure to\nwork with, week after week.\nThanks to the other sabbaticals and the Union staff for their\nhelp throughout the year. Thanks\nto everyone who helped produce\nthe Union Handbook 2004 and our\nnew magazine I, Science. Thanks\nto Alisdair Wren for running and\nrevamping our website. And thanks\nto everyone who has kept me company on a long Tuesday night.\nWhoever you are, and whatever\nyou think of Felix, I hope we\u2019ve\nmanaged to provide you with some\ncombination of information and\nentertainment during your studies.\nIf you\u2019re leaving Imperial, best of\nluck for the future.\nFinally, just to create a bit of symmetry with my first editorial and to\nprove that we don\u2019t always learn\nfrom our mistakes, guess what time\nit is. Yes, it\u2019s 5am again. Thanks for\nreading.\nI hardly think that a few pop stars\ncould do a worse job on global poverty than the economists have done\nso far. Surely, humanity\u2019s greatest\nfailing as we move into the 21st century is the shocking fact that as the\nworld becomes richer and richer, the\ngap between rich and poor becomes\nwider and wider. Never have we\nbeen so rich. Never have there been\nso many suffering and dying from\npoverty. This is not an ideological\npoint \u2013 it is a point of fact.\nLast weeks article (\u2018Making economics history?\u2019) suggested that the\nsolution lies with the economists.\nWe would do well to recall the leaked\nmemo written by the chief economist of the World Bank in December\n1991, Larry Summers (now president of Harvard University \u2013 the\nman who recently made the controversial comments about women in\nscience). He argued that the World\nBank should be encouraging the\nmigration of \u201cdirty industries\u201d to\nthe \u201cLess Developed Countries\n(LDCs)\u201d, for which he gave three\nreasons.\nFirstly, it is only rational that the\nincreased morbidity and mortality\ncaused by health-impairing pollution should occur in a country with\nthe lowest costs, and hence the\nlowest wages. \u201cI think the economic\nlogic behind dumping a load of toxic\nwaste in the lowest wage country\nis impeccable and we should face\nup to that.\u201d He then says we should\nattempt to distribute pollution more\nevenly across the world, regardless\nof its source: \u201cI\u2019ve always thought\nthat under-populated countries in\nAfrica are vastly under-polluted,\ntheir air quality is probably vastly\ninefficiently low compared to Los\nAngeles or Mexico City\u201d. Finally\nhe explains that in countries where\nthe life expectancy is low already,\nthe increased risk of prostate cancer is no cause for concern. In\nother words, the poor don\u2019t matter at all \u2013 their lives are just not\neconomically useful. For the full\nmemo see www.counterpunch.org/\nsummers.html.\nJose Lutzenburger (then Brazil\u2019s\nSecretary of the Environment)\nreplied to Summers, saying: \u201cYour\nthoughts [provide] a concrete example of the unbelievable alienation,\nreductionist thinking, social ruthlessness and the arrogant ignorance\nof many conventional \u2018economists\u2019\nconcerning the nature of the world\nwe live in.\u201d I think this sums it up\nperfectly.\nSummers closes his memo with\nthe following statement: \u201cThe problem with the arguments against all\nof these proposals for more pollution in LDCs (intrinsic rights to\ncertain goods, moral reasons, social\nconcerns, lack of adequate mar-kets, etc) could be turned around\nand used more or less effectively\nagainst every Bank proposal for\nliberalisation.\u201d From this we should\ntake our cue.\nSo, hang your hopes for the poor\non these economists if you will.\nAlternatively, you could face up to\nthe reality that to a large extent poverty is exacerbated, if not caused, by\nthe policies of the rich nations. As\nsuch, the best hope for the future\nis for the citizens of these nations\nto dismantle the deceit in which we\nhave become embroiled, and refuse\nto accept this. It is not complicated.\nYou do not need a PhD in economics\nto understand the problems. It is\nsimply a question of politics, that is,\nthe competing interests of the rich\nand powerful with the rest of us. We\nlive in a free and democratic country\n\u2013 we have power and we have the\nresponsibility to act. If we do not,\nno-one else will.\n\u25cf Students from Imperial are going\nup to the G8 summit in Edinburgh\nand Gleneagles from 2 to 6 July to\njoin the protests and make our voic-es, and the voices of the poor, heard.\nTravel and the conference are sub-sidised by the Union so please consider joining us. Contact cs602@ic.\nac.uk for more information and to\njoin us.\nMaking economics history!\nAndrew Ireson responds to last week\u2019s criticism of the Make Poverty History campaign\n\u201cFace the reality\nthat poverty is\nexacerbated, if not\ncaused, by the policies\nof the rich nations\u201d\n\u201cWe live in a free and\ndemocratic country.\nWe have the power\nto act. If we do not,\nno-one else will\u201d\nFarewell statement\nFor many of you, this will be the\nlast issue of Felix you read whilst at\nImperial College. That\u2019s certainly\nthe case for me. This is the last\nissue of term and on 31 July I leave\nImperial after nearly six years.\nAppreciation\nThere are many people who I need\nto thank for their support, guidance\nand mentoring during my time at\nCollege. Inevitably I shall forget\nto mention, or allude, to someone\nand for that I can only apologise in\nadvance.\nI wouldn\u2019t be here now if I hadn\u2019t\ngraduated in Information Systems\nEngineering and I therefore owe a\ndebt to staff and fellow students in\nthe Departments of Computing and\nElectrical Engineering. In particular Peter Cheung, the Director of\nUndergraduate Studies and many\nother lecturers for the frequent\ncoursework extensions I had to ask\nfor because I was too busy running\nsome part or other of the Union\u2019s\nactivities as a volunteer.\nDinesh Ganesearajah was\nPresident of City & Guilds College\nUnion in my first year in 1999-2000.\nHe was the first (and only) C&G\nPresident to have been re-elected to\na second term (2000-2001). Dinesh\nwas not the average Union \u2018hack\u2019\nand had precious little time for\nlengthy debates in Council meetings\nor other politicking. Whilst others\nwould worry about the precise rules\nenshrined in the Union\u2019s constitu-tion, he would just ignore it and just\nfocus on doing whatever he believed\nto be in the best interests of stu-dents.\nIt was a philosophy that I continued when I succeeded him and,\ncontroversially, adopted later as\nPresident of Imperial College Union.\nSome will have read of some of the\nensuing political fallout from the\npages of Felix this year. But ulti-mately, this laissez-faire attitude to\nthe finer points of the rules secured\nthe highest ever turnouts in all\nUnion elections this year, one of the\nfirst successful transitions to online\nvoting in any students\u2019 union, and\nultimately many more students getting involved in the business of the\nUnion\u2019s democratic processes.\nThe Union is nothing without its\nvolunteers or the staff who facilitate them. During my years as a\nUnion Officer I am fortunate to have\nworked with many other co-opera-tive, talented and supportive colleagues who I can\u2019t possibly list. I\nhave publicly recognised most in\none way or another. Those I have\nnever mentioned include Chris\nPiper, former President of King\u2019s\nCollege Union, who was President of\nULU (University of London Union)\nlast year and provided support\nand guidance in difficult circum-stances. Sir Graeme Davies, the\nVice-Chancellor of the University\nof London, also gave me invaluable advice in dealing with difficult\ncircumstances in the College. My\nDeputies over the last two years\n(Richard, Mike, Sam and Sameena)\nhave displayed remarkable patience\nwith me and have been a tremendous support.\nDespite sometimes being at loggerheads over student issues, and\nthe occasional public disagreement,\nI have managed to maintain cordial\nrelations with most senior College\nstaff. In fact they have often been\nvery supportive when I have been\nable to articulate a strong student\ncase. To that end I would like to place\non record my thanks to Sir Richard\nSykes, the Rector, as well Professor\nChris Hankin, now a Pro Rector but\nDean of City & Guilds College when\nI was C&G President. Several other\nsenior College staff are mentioned\nelsewhere but I would also like to\nthank Heather Allan and her team\nat ICT, Chris Gosling and his HR\nstaff, and Hameed Khan\u2019s financial\naccountants for their invaluable\nassistance this last year.\nFinally I ought to thank my friends\nand family for their endurance.\nBuried away in College and Union\nactivity I have probably neglected\nthose closest to me over the last\ntwo years and I am grateful for their\npatience in accepting what is important to me.\nFinal remarks\nI have thoroughly enjoyed my time at\nImperial. It\u2019s sad for me to be leaving after so long. You can become\nvery attached to an institution that\nyou\u2019ve put your life and soul into and\nI\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t admit to shedding a few tears whilst writing this\ncolumn. Nevertheless I\u2019m also glad\nthat it is time for me to be moving on\nto new challenges.\nI imagine I might get a party invite\nto the College (and Union\u2019s) centenary celebrations in 2007, but my\ninvolvement is otherwise at an end.\nIt\u2019s been an honour and a privilege\nto serve as your President for two\nyears but the time has come for\nme to pass the baton on. I wish the\nUnion, and Imperial as a whole, the\nvery best of luck. Sameena, it\u2019s over\nto you.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\n\n"

What\u2019s going to happen to our Southside Bar?\u201d\nBut believe it or not, the Southside\nBar is not the only long-serving tradition that will be lost in the midst of\nthe Southside demolition debris. The\nImperial College Islamic Society has\nbeen holding weekly Friday Prayers\nin Southside for more than 20 years.\nAnd some even quote the figure\nnearer to 30!\nThe \u2018Juma Prayer\u2019, formally\nknown as the Congregation Prayer,\nacts as a focal point for at least\n300 students during term time from\na range of societies, not just the\nIslamic society.\nYou will see many attendees from\nsocieties like Arab, Bangladesh,\nMalaysian and Pakistan to name\na few. You may even spot a few\nfaces from the local community,\nfrom Embassy workers to Science\nMuseum staff. But whoever you\nmight bump into on their way to\nJuma on a Friday at midday, he\nor she will be sure to tell you that\nJuma is a time for them to revitalise\ntheir connection with God; a time to\nreflect and evaluate oneself during\nthe past week. It is also a time to\ncome together as an community to\nshare ideas and support one another in people\u2019s everyday affairs.\n\u201cSo what?\u201d I hear you cry, but\nthis religious and sociable gathering means much more than that!\nIn fact Juma is one of those weekly\nhighlights in many Muslim students\u2019\nlives. The post-Juma ritual of catching up with the week\u2019s events and\ngrabbing some \u201cmunch\u201d has become\nan addictive tradition for many\neach Friday afternoon. The Juma\nPrayer at Imperial has also hosted\nmany charities to raise thousands\nof pounds for the less fortunate\nacross the world. In November 2004,\nIslamic Society collected \u00a39000 for\nthe Bangladesh floods that occurred\nseveral months prior. Unfortunately\nall of this will come to a close on\nFriday 24 June, when Southside is\nknocked down.\nThe Islamic Society has been given\nthe use of the Union gym over summer as a temporary solution. Over\nthe summer, the Juma prayers will\nbe held in this gym between 1 and\n2pm each Friday, until a long-term\nreplacement has been found. The\nJuma attendees will find it a little\ndifficult in the gym itself, as it is too\nsmall to fit the entire congregation;\nthe Prayer has to be split into two\nrooms, and on some weeks it will\noccur on two floors!\nWe, the Islamic Society, would like\nto notify all students of the Juma\nlocation change from Southside to\nthe Union Building (opposite Beit\nQuad) during the summer.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 16 June 2005 9\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nShooting stars to predict climate change\nAt the edge of space, the Eath\u2019s atmosphere may actually be cooling. Emma-Lynn Donadieu\nreports on scientists using an unusual technique to monitor the mesosphere\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like going to Ikea\nand buying a flat-pack. It\ncomes in several boxes, you\nput it together, plug it in, turn\nthe power on and hope that\nit doesn\u2019t blow up,\u201d explains\nDr Peter Younger, a postdoc\nfrom the University of Bath.\nHe recently returned from a\ntwo-month expedition braving severe gales, some rather aggressive fur seals and\n\u2018horrific\u2019 wind chill, to set up\na radar the size of a football field on a rocky beach in\nAntarctica.\nThe new radar, a joint\nproject between the\nUniversity of Bath and the\nBritish Antarctic Survey, will\nallow scientists to measure\nclimate change in the meso-sphere, the highest layer of\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere at the\nvery edge of space.\nLuckily for Dr Younger, this\nradar is entirely autonomous\nand can be controlled via the\ninternet from the warmth of\nan office.\nThe team at the University\nof Bath will use the radar\nto explore the theory that\nwhile the lower atmosphere\nis warming; the mesosphere\nmay be cooling by as much as\none degree Centigrade a year.\nUnder the higher pressures of\nthe lower atmosphere, carbon\ndioxide has a reputation as a\ngreenhouse gas and acts as\nan efficient heating agent. In\nthe mesosphere, however, the\npressures are so low that the\nchemistry changes and carbon dioxide acts as a refriger-ant. Unfortunately, at heights\nof 80-100km the mesosphere is\nnotoriously difficult to investi-gate, so the rate at which it is\ncooling is unknown.\n\u201cThe mesosphere is too\nhigh to reach by Met balloons\nor aeroplanes so you can\u2019t fly\na thermometer up there. You\ncan fly a rocket through it\nwith a thermometer attached,\nbut a rocket gives you a snapshot and it costs \u00a3100,000 a\ntime,\u201d explains Professor\nNick Mitchell, who heads the\nproject in the Department\nof Electronic and Electrical\nEngineering at the University\nof Bath. \u201cBut fortunately,\nnature provides us with an\nexcellent answer to the problem of investigating the mesosphere.\u201d\nMeteors the size of a grain\nof sand burn up in the mesosphere creating the romantic\nphenomena of shooting stars.\nHitting the upper atmosphere\nat a typical velocity of 12 to 17\nkilometres per second, they\ncreate a column of ionised gas\na couple of metres across and\ntens of kilometres in length.\nUsing the radar, the team\ncan bounce radio waves off the\nionized gas columns to produce distinctive echoes, which\nact rather like thermometers.\nThe way the echoes decay\nas the ionisation diffuses is\ndependent on the temperature of the mesosphere. By\nanalysingthisdecay,scientists\ncan obtain accurate temperature measurements to within\nfive degrees centigrade. Data\nthe group at the University of\nBath have analysed to date\nreveals an extremely chilly\nmesosphere with temperatures delving as low as \u2013130\ndegrees Centigrade.\nBy continually monitoring\ntemperature fluctuations in\nthe mesosphere, Professor\nMitchell and his team hope\nto separate known changes\nin the upper atmosphere\nassociated with the Sun\u2019s 11-year solar cycle from climate\nchange caused by carbon\ndioxide produced on Earth.\n\u201cThe mesosphere has been\ncalled the miner\u2019s canary for\nclimate change; meaning that\nit is very sensitive and the\nchanges there may be larger than in any other part of\nthe atmosphere,\u201d comments\nProfessor Mitchell. \u201cThe\ngreat advantage of the radar\nis that we can pick up 5000\nmeteors a day and we can do\nthis day after day after day, so\nwe can continually monitor\nthe temperature for as long as\nthe radar is running.\u201d\nThe radar in Antarctica is\nthe latest addition in a global array being installed by\nthe University of Bath group.\nTheir most recent edition\nwas purposely built as a clone\nof another radar inside the\nArctic Circle in northern\nSweden and will enable them\nto compare the upper atmosphere of the Arctic with that\nof the Antarctic.\nNew physical phenomena may already be appearing because of the cooling\ntrend in the mesosphere.\nThese include unusual clouds\nknown as noctilucent clouds\nand sprites formed by gigantic lightening discharges\nfrom clouds up into the meso-sphere.\nFor us here on Earth the\neffects of are likely to be less\ndramatic. How a cooling mesosphere interacts with the\nwarming lower atmosphere\nhas yet to be determined.\n\u201cThere is some theoretical\nwork that suggests that there\nare coupling processes that\ncan connect what happens\nupstairs with what happens\ndownstairs. The effects, if\nthey are there, are subtle and\nmysterious and are simply\nnot well understood,\u201d explains\nProfessor Mitchell.\nLike the myriad of other\nmonitoring techniques, a\nflat-pack radar on a remote\nAntarctic beach won\u2019t provide\nthe definitive answer on climate change. Nevertheless,\nshooting stars are not just a\npretty sight but may reveal\nnew insights into a poorly\nunderstood part of the atmos-phere, enabling scientists to\nfit another piece into the complex climate puzzle.\nShooting star events take place in the mesosphere\n\u201cThe team will explore\nthe theory that the\nmesosphere may be\ncooling by as much as\none degree centigrade\nper year\u201d\nThis week at the Dana Centre\nExpand your mind for FREE, right\nnext to Imperial College\u2019s South\nKen campus.\nInquiries and bookings:\nTel: 020 7942 4040\nEmail: tickets@danacentre.org.uk\nThursday 16 June 7.30pm\nAstro Black Morphologies\nJoin Anna Piva and Eddie George, the artist-musicians behind Astro Black\nMorphologies, and experts from the worlds of astrophysics, electronic music and art\nto participate in a dialogue about contemporary astronomy and sound art\nTuesday 21 June 12.30pm\nCooleurs\nA multimedia fusion of live and recorded images and music: part composed, part im-provised, completely entertaining!

Usual Felix rules apply.\nAlan Ng\nFilm Editor\nIt\u2019s like warm apple \u03c0\nMartin Smith investigates the x factor\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nI\u2019d love to be able to say that mathematics and sex have been the\nkey features of my degree here\nat Imperial, but sadly my recent\nexams proved I\u2019ve spent more time\nthinking about one than the other.\nTo complement this, I\u2019d like to recommend to you all Clio Cresswell\u2019s\nbook, which provides a rationale\nfor the number crunching I\u2019ve been\navoiding for the last three years.\nFunnily enough, the word \u2018sex\u2019\nis printed around five times larger\nthan the word \u2018mathematics\u2019 on the\nfront cover, and despite the old saying this is a fairly good judge of its\ncontent. Whilst I\u2019m not normally\nmuch of a fan of \u2018popular\u2019 science\nbooks, I must admit this one did\ntickle my fancy.\nA fairly sedate start sees Clio\ntoying with the ideas of describing\nthe patterns of love with differential equations. Some of you may\nbe familiar with these ideas in the\ncontext of population dynamics or\nepidemiology: in this case, \u2018love is\nthe drug\u2019. Finally you can map your\nfear of commitment or your desire\nto be loved with a few extra terms\nin an equation \u2013 ecstasy for any\nImperial geek.\nPerhaps not so relevant is the discussion of how to know when to stop\nhunting for a lifelong partner: is\nshe the one? Fortunately an answer\nis at hand if you can reduce your\nmate-finding situation to a string of\nletters, and Clio explains why you\nshould road-test 12 people before\npicking the next best one after that\nto settle down with. Chat-up lines\nare not included.\nIt\u2019s not all just about humping though. For me, the climax\nof the book was the chapter that\nuses another meaning of \u2018sex\u2019 and\ndescribes in detail some reasons\nwhy there isn\u2019t a \u2018third gender\u2019, but\nthat there might conceivably have\nbeen one in the past.\nThe style is very light-hearted,\nand the maths isn\u2019t really derived\nin the strict sense: it just tends\nto be \u2018here\u2019s an impressive looking\nequation for anyone looking over\nyour shoulder\u2019, rather than expecting you to understand it yourself.\nSome of you will recognise parts of\nit, but it\u2019s all explained with sexual abandon and includes snippets\nof graph theory, game theory and\nmatching problems to whet your\nappetite. The author seems intent\non seducing you to mathematics\nwith the promise of an understanding of the female orgasm, but at\ntimes her informal, chatty style just\nequates to using multiple punctuation marks (?!) and an ellipsis to end\neach paragraph\u2026\nAs one might expect, the final\nchapter is entitled \u2018Orgasm\u2019, but\nit\u2019s by no means the highlight and\njust seems to be a nod towards the\nreal reason why you picked up this\nbook.\nAs a general guide though, for\nan entertaining book about sex,\nrelationship advice and tactics for\nwho to hit on at a celebrity party,\nall with a light dusting of equations on top, look no further than\nMathematics and Sex. If you were\nhoping for more diagrams, check\nout Housewives Love Mechanics;\nbut if carefully defined Greek letters do it for you then stick with\nBerkshire\u2019s Classical Mechanics.\nMathematics and Sex\nby Clio Creswell\n(Allen & Unwin)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\n\n"

Firing as part of the latest volley of London rock groups, they follow the current trend of recognising\nand paying homage to the punkera,\nwith various magazines comparing\nthem to classic acts like The Clash\nand The Jam. If this description\nsounds too much like The Others for\nyour liking, don\u2019t worry; their songs\ntend to reflect a more personal line\nrather then harking on about how\ncool they are.\nArriving on stage after some\nstrong support courtesy of The Izzys\nand trippy rockers Trap 2, the band\nform an immediate attraction with\nthe crowd, with the four piece shaking hands and hugging more excitable members of the crowd, allowing people up on stage to, ahem,\n\u2018skank\u2019 during the more jumpy num-bers, such as ska flashback Lazy\nDays, which is the perfect anthem\nfor those care-free post exam days\nyou\u2019ll have.\nIn fact, with their ska influences\nThe Rifles could be seen as a modern day Specials, and this is most\nobvious on Repeat Offender, with a\nmenacing bassline steamrolling the\nsong along and the theme of adolescent hooliganism apparent from\nthe title.\nTheir main strength comes from\ntheir ability to make catchy, shouty\nmusic which accurately captures\nthe spirit of London circa 1977. Just\ntake the performance of their first\nsingle, Peace and Quiet, which, following a swift drum intro, breaks\ninto a series of swaggering guitars which has the whole crowd\njumping like crazy, as the songs\nbuilds up to its strong point, the\nanthemic \u201c\u2026All I want is a little\npeace and quiet!\u201d as its chorus. This\nis not a one off: when the B-side\nBreakdown is played later in the\nset, all the elements combine again\nto make another astounding live\ntrack.\nUnfortunately the set flies by too\nquickly, and after the forthcoming\nsingle When I\u2019m Alone is finished\nthe crowd surround the stage so\nthe band can\u2019t leave to do the whole\n\u2018we\u2019re just popping off before we\nplay our encore\u2019 routine, forcing\nthem into the final track, the haunting Lost In London.\nThe Rifles are playing a succession of gigs around the country in\nthe forthcoming months, and this\nreporter urges you to go out and\ncatch their brash rock music whilst\nyou can, being a welcome and\nupcoming addition to the popular\nmusic canon.\nOh, and as a final note, if anyone\nfrom the 100 Club happens to be\nreading this, can you please sort\nout your chairs and the toilets?

He stands accused of running websites to raise funds and recruit\nnew members for terrorist organisations\nin Chechnya and Afghanistan. His case is\nthe first to be heard under the Extradition\nAct 2003, which allows British citizens to be\nextradited to the US without the need for\nany evidence to be provided and without the\naccused being given any chance to respond\nto the allegations.\nIn December, after a highly charged\nCouncil meeting, Imperial College Union\ndecided to campaign for his release from\nprison.\nWriting for Felix in January, Mr Ahmad\nsaid: \u201cI know, and God knows, that I am not\na terrorist and that I have not done anything wrong or illegal.\u201d\nIn May, as hundreds of people protested\noutside Bow Street Magistrates Court, a\njudge ruled in favour of Mr Ahmad\u2019s extra-dition. The final decision now rests with the\nHome Secretary.\nLast orders for Southside Bar\nWhen the Southside area is rebuilt next\nyear, the popular Southside Bar will not be\nreplaced. The building, which also contains\nhalls of residence and the health centre,\nis due to be demolished in July. College\nredevelopment plans make no allowance\nfor a bar.\nImperial College Union was given the\noption of using the communal space in\nLinstead Hall for a replacement bar, but\nrejected it. \u201cIt would be unfair to leave\nLinsteadstudentswithnoprivatecommunal\nspace,\u201d said Mustafa Arif, the President.\nJust weeks before its closure, Southside\nBar won the runner-up award in the national \u2018Club of the Year\u2019 competition run by the\nCampaign for Real Ale (CAMRA).\nMeanwhile, over 3000 people have signed\na petition calling for the continued existence\nof \u201ca Southside Bar\u201d on campus. Students\u2019\ngroups are investigating alternative locations but are running out of time \u2013 Southside\nwill close its doors for good on 24 June. The\nsituation is set to worsen when the Union\nbars in Beit Quad are closed for refurbishment next year. There are plans for a new\nbar when Linstead hall is rebuilt, but this is\nunlikely to occur for several years.\nStudents believe that the food available\non Imperial College\u2019s main campus is\nunhealthy and overpriced, according to a\nFelix poll conducted in May.\nOf the students interviewed, only 26% felt\nthat food on campus was \u2018healthy\u2019 and just\n32% believed it was \u2018good value for money\u2019.\nThe poll also shows that caterers would be\nwise to reconsider the nutritional content of\ntheir food, with 67% of students saying they\nwould be interested in healthier options\nthan already exist.\nEdward Lilley, Imperial\u2019s Catering\nManager, told Felix that the College serves\nfood that is popular with students. \u201cWe\nprovide customers with what they want,\u201d\nhe said.\nMany of the sandwiches sold in the JCR\ncontain worryingly high levels of salt and\nare significantly more expensive than similar products offered by local stores such as\nBoots and Marks & Spencer.\nCollege clothing controversy\nUnion staff told Felix that they were asked\nto stop selling certain items of clothing\nwhich were seen as offensive to the Imperial\nCollege brand.\nThe College\u2019s Director of Communications, Ardi Kolah, and Director of Project\nManagement, Chris Towler, visited the\nUnion shop on the Sherfield walkway in\nMay. \u201cI understand that my staff found\nthem quite threatening and intimidating,\u201d\nsaid Union President Mustafa Arif.\nThe staff felt that they had been asked\nto take various items \u2013 bearing the name\n\u2018Imperial College London\u2019 without using the\nnew logo \u2013 off the shelves.\nMr Arif continued: \u201cIt was stock that was\napparently \u2018offensive to the brand\u2019, in particular the underwear and the fun T-shirts,\nlike the Matrix spin-off and so on.\u201d\nMr Kolah said: \u201cWe\u2019re working together\nto find a solution to this. There is policy on\nhow the brand ought to be used, and there\nshould have been more importance placed\non following that to the letter.\u201d\nStaff say central library is \u2018an embarrassment\u2019\nImperial College\u2019s central library has\nbecome \u201can embarrassment\u201d and \u201ca total\ndump,\u201d according to some members of its\nstaff. In letters to Felix in May, two central library librarians launched a scathing\nattack on College management for \u201cputting\nfinances before education\u201d.\nSir Richard Sykes, the Rector, told Felix\nthat the central library is \u201cnot an embar-rassment, absolutely not. This is the way\nforward, it has to be 24 hours a day, seven\ndays a week.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the mechanical engineering department library will be transferred\nto the central library despite opposition\nfrom students. A petition signed by over\n400 mechanical engineering students was\nhanded to staff, who then assured them\nthat their library would remain open for 18\nmonths. But it was later announced that it\nwould close this summer.\nHelen Dawson, the mechanical engineering department representative, told Felix:\n\u201cThe students are gobsmacked that such\nan important resource in our department\nis being closed down, and it is a sore blow\nwhen we thought the library was saved for\nnow. No effort has been made to move the\nlibrary to unused store rooms in a bid to\nkeep it.\u201d\nSir Richard said that the College needs\nto transfer \u201cas many of the departmental libraries as possible\u201d to the central\nlibrary, \u201cbecause you cannot work in a\ndepartmental library 24 hours a day, 7 days\na week\u201d.\nImperial cyclists killed on Cromwell Road\nA postgraduate student and an ICT manager were both killed while cycling in the\nSouth Kensington area. The two accidents\noccurred on the same road within three\nmonths of each other.\nApijak Srivannavit, from Thailand, was\nstudying for an MSc in environmental engi-neering. It appears that he was at the junction of Queen\u2019s Gate and Cromwell Road\nwhen he was hit by a coach in late May. He\nwas 26.\nThomas Sippel-Dau, who was 54 and originally from Germany, had worked in ICT at\nImperial for many years. He was knocked\noff his bicycle and killed on Cromwell Road\nby a 4x4 vehicle which then drove away.\nImperial College Union called on students\nand staff to unite in demanding changes to\nCromwell Road, reducing the impact of dangerous motor vehicles and better reflecting\nits place in the cultural heart of London.\nPractical advice for cyclists and information on campaigning are available at www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/icbug/cromwell.html.\nCampus food unhealthy and overpriced,\nsay students\nIn brief\n\u25cf Due to timetabling issues and the way the\nCollege term dates were arranged, many\nstudents faced the difficult prospect of having\nonly a two-week Christmas break in which to\nrevise for their final exams. The Christmas\nvacation usually lasts for three weeks.\n\u25cf In February, Felix exclusively revealed\nthat the Imperial College Union shop and\nnewsagent were selling three Cadbury\u2019s\nCreme Eggs for just 90p.\nThe shop and the newsagent, located on\nthe Sherfield Walkway, were inundated by\ncrazed students desperate for the fondant-filled treats.\n\u25cf Tony Blair visited a research laboratory\nin Imperial College\u2019s chemistry department\nin March. On the same day, the Government\nannounced that it would invest \u00a310bn into UK\nscientific research.\nThe Prime Minister and Patricia Hewitt,\nthe Trade and Industry Secretary, visited\nProfessor Donna Blackmond, a US citizen\nwho holds the College\u2019s chair in catalysis.\n\u25cf Death threats were made to College security guards by a group of aggressive young\nmen, at least one of whom was carrying a\nweapon, as they left a Union event in Beit\nQuad in February.\n\u25cf Smoking was banned in Da Vinci\u2019s Bar\nfor a trial period beginning in March. The\nbar, on the South Kensington campus, was\nofficially smoke-free all day every day for\nthree months.\nThe response to the trial was mixed \u2013 more\npositive comments were received than negative ones, but support for the ban was not high\nenough to convince the Union to introduce it\non a full-time basis. Smoking is now permitted after 9pm on weekday evenings and any\ntime at weekends, again for a trial period. On\nour letters page, students have expressed\ntheir disappointment at the reintroduction of\nsmoking in Da Vinci\u2019s.\n\u25cf Eighties superstar Mr T joined an elite\ngroup of physicists in May, when his picture\nappeared in a display of Nobel Laureates in\nthe Blackett Laboratory. The prank amused\nstudents as they revised for exams, but the\nphotograph was soon removed.\n\u25cf The Imperial College Union summer ball\nsecured over \u00a334,000 in funding and, according to the organisers, \u201clooks set to be a\ngreat event\u201d. The Hollywood-themed ball has\nbeen promoted around campus by characters ranging from \u2018Marilyn Monroe\u2019 to \u2018Darth\nVader\u2019. It will take place this Saturday on the\nSouth Kensington campus.\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 16 June 2005\n12\nComments from\nanother librarian\nDear Felix,\nI have followed the recent correspondence about the Central\nLibrary, and the responses of senior\nmanagement, with great interest.\nThe Rector, in his interview with\nFelix, brushed off the concerns\nraised in the first of two anonymous\nletters from central librarians. In\nher letter last week, Clare Jenkins,\nDirector of Library Services, managed to avoid any reference to the\nletters at all.\nIn truth, neither the Rector nor\nMs Jenkins have dealt properly with\nthe central concerns raised in these\nletters: how exactly is it in students\u2019\ninterests to cram more departmental libraries into the Central\nLibrary, thus reducing the amount\nof stock available for consultation,\nand at the same time exacerbating\nthe problems caused by 24/7 open-ing? And how can one of the premier educational establishments in\nthe country hope to maintain and\nimprove its reputation, when its\nmain library is allowed to degenerate into a third rate hostel.\nAnother issue raised in the first\nletter was the \u201ccavalier\u201d treatment\nmeted out to the Science Museum\nLibrary. It is undeniable that the\nastronomical hike in the charge\nmade to the Science Museum for\nits library\u2019s occupancy of part of the\nCentral Library building has jeop-ardised the library\u2019s future.\nHas the Rector, in his remorseless\ndrive to implement his vision of a\ncollege fit to operate successfully\nin the new global education market,\npaused to consider that he is in\ndanger of sweeping away a valuable\nresource for this and future generations of students, academics and\nmembers of the public alike? The\nScience Museum Library is one of\nthe foremost libraries for the history of science and technology in the\nworld. The unique mix of material\nit contains, built up over a period\nof 120 years, will be destroyed if the\nmuseum is forced to disperse the\ncollections.\nIs it really part of the Rector\u2019s\nvision to see this valuable resource\nlost to the national and wider international community?\nMember of Staff\nScience Museum Library\n(Name supplied)\nOutrage at return of\nsmoking in Da Vinci\u2019s\nDear Editor,\nI want to state my disgust at the\ndecision announced last week that\nthe union will start allowing smoking in the Da Vinci\u2019s bar again.\nI always thought that the student\nunion should be a progressive place\nthat would want to do what is best\nfor the students. The government\nare making moves to implement\nlarge scale smoking bans across the\ncountry so why can\u2019t the union take\na step forward and do it now.\nAccording to last weeks Felix,\nduring the trial of the smoking ban\nthe union did not lose money from\nthe bar and also from the comments\nsheets, more people supported the\nsmoking ban than opposed it. This in\nitself is unusual as people will generally take more time to complain\nabout things than agree with them,\nso the general consensus must be\neven more in favour of the ban. I\neven know people that have started going to the union specifically\nbecause it\u2019s the only non-smoking\nbar in the area. So why, why, why,\nwould the union stop it?\nThe new rules allow smoking in\nDa Vinci\u2019s after 9pm but in my opinion is the worst time! During lunch\ntime the level of smoking is low, the\nonly time it becomes unpleasant\nand sometimes unbearable is on the\nbusy nights, so this should be the\ntimes to target.\nPassive smoking is proven to\ncause damage to people\u2019s health\nand not only that, it is very unpleasant for the non-smokers. Why should\nthe people who are intent on doing\nharm to themselves have the right\nto inflict this upon other students\nwho want to use the bar? Do the\nunion not care about this?\nCharles Haworth\nPhilip Bates\nFelicity Eakins\nDear Editor,\nI\u2019d like to express my regret that\nthe smoking ban was not left in\nplace in DV\u2019s after the trial ban\nended recently. As an employee of\nthe Union Bars I enjoyed working in a smoke free environment, I\nthought it was more pleasant and\njust generally cleaner since there\nwas no smoking litter that needed\nto be cleaned up.\nWalking in between the Union Bar\nand DV\u2019s was utterly astounding\nwhilst the ban was in place... you\ncould actually see for the lack of\nsmog! It made for a much more\npleasant working (and drinking)\natmosphere.\nObviously going to a pub goes\nhand in hand with a smoking environment and that\u2019s fair enough.\nIf people want to smoke then let\nthem. But the fact is they have 3\nplaces to smoke whilst enjoying the\nUnion Bars. They have dB\u2019s, the\nUnion Bar itself, and outdoors. Now\nafter 9pm non-smokers will have\nno choice but to sit outdoors to get\naway from the smoke. That\u2019s all fine\nand dandy during the summer but\nwhat about winter?\nAccording to last weeks article\nMiss Misbahuddin says, \u201cThe ban\nmeant that running costs increased\nat weekends, as extra staff were\nneeded to open the adjacent Union\nBar\u201d. I work at the bar in question\nand have done a number of weekend shifts (both before the ban and\nduring) and I have to totally disagree with that statement. As far as\nI can remember there has always\nbeen at least 3 staff in the DV\u2019s and\nthe Union on weekends, one managing and two bar staff. That has\nalways been the case and it is more\nthan enough to run both bars during the weekends. The weekends\naren\u2019t ever as busy as the weekdays\nso two bar staff is more than enough\n(one per bar). So how running costs\nwould increase over the weekends\nis a total mystery to me. In fact what\nshe said implies that the Union Bar\nwas open especially to allow smokers a place on the weekends. That\u2019s\nutter rubbish. The Union Bar has\nalways been open during weekends\nto the best of my knowledge. It\nwas never opened just to cater for\nsmokers.\nIn fact during the ban I cant\nremember there being a time when\nbusiness has ever been down solely\ndue to the fact that there has been\na smoking ban. I have to admit\nthat the ban was mostly during an\nEaster break and the exam period\nso an accurate calculation of the\nloss in revenue due to the ban could\nnot be made. A fault of Union policy\nand foolhardy planning, methinks,\nbut from working there I have to say\nI have never noticed the difference.\nI myself do not smoke so am obviously biased in favour of a smoking\nban. But its not like we would be\noutlawing smoking altogether. As i\nmentioned, smokers still have other\noptions within the union complex\nwith which to smoke and drink. But\nwhy should non-smokers be limited\nto enjoying their drinks until 9pm\nonly in a smoke free atmosphere?\nThen they have no other alternative\nbut to leave.\nIt almost seems as though the you\nare punishing non-smokers from\ngoing to the union. It has always\nbeen a god given right to have a\nsmoke with your drink at a pub, so\nwhy should the reverse not be the\ntrue for non smokers too?\nA simple solution would be to\nhave DV\u2019s smoke free permanently,\naffording the non smokers a place\nto enjoy themselves but also not\nrestricting the smokers to not smok-ing. Obviously the Union Bar would\nstay a smoking bar as would dB\u2019s. I\ndon\u2019t understand the financial or the\npractical arguments against that.\nMez Pahlan\nDV\u2019s & Union Bar bar staff\nSameena Misbahuddin, Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services),\nresponds:\nThank you for your letters.\nRegarding the extra costs; during the Easter holidays, usually\nonly DaVinci\u2019s is open. However,\nto maintain a room that smokers could go to whilst there was\na smoking ban in DaVinci\u2019s over\nthis period, the Union Bar was also\nopened. The extra cost which was\nincurred due to this was approximately \u00a31000.\nDuring term time on the weekends DaVinci\u2019s is open on Saturday\nand Sunday, but in the evening\nof Sunday, DaVinci\u2019s closes and\nthe Union Bar is opened. However\nduring the trial extra staff were\nneeded on the weekends in order\nto allow both the Union Bar and\nDaVinci\u2019s to be open, to ensure\nthere was a no smoking bar as well\nas a smoking bar.\nWhen the Union deduced that\nthere was a loss of revenue, it obviously took into account the fact\nthat the ban spanned over Easter\nholidays. Therefore when looking at\nrevenue it was compared to the figures from this time last year (and\nthe change in dates of last year\u2019s\nand this year\u2019s holidays were also\ntaken into account). During the\ndiscussions, details of last year\u2019s\nsales figures, this year\u2019s figures\nand trends so far this academic\nyear were all taken into account,\nso it was not a simple decision to\nmake. On top of this, the feedback\nfrom Yoursay was included.\nHaving looked at all the informa-tion, there was no clear answer\n\u2013 there was more favour for the ban\nin the feedback through \u2018Yoursay\u2019,\nbut then the loss in trade indicated that students were going away\nfrom the building. There were also\nextra costs as well as a loss in\nrevenue.\nAs the resolution, it was decided\nto continue with non-smoking from\n9am to 9pm Monday to Friday. This\nwas in effect a compromise, as\nthere was not enough evidence that\na total ban was the correct decision\nto make, whilst at the same time\nnot enough evidence that reverting\nto smoking as before was the correct decision either.\nHowever, in the proposals (which\nare still in their early stages) for\nthe redevelopment of the Union\nBuilding, the need for a non-smok-ing area has already been identified by the Strategic Review.\nBut before the redevelopment of\nthe Union Building, the question\nis what we do with the current\nUnion provisions. As a non-smoker\nmyself I understand your feelings,\nbut the committee could only go on\nthe evidence they have and try to\nfind a solution that will be the best\ncompromise.\nWhy McAloon missed the\npoint on poverty\nDear Editor,\nI write in response to the article\nby Stephen McAloon in last week\u2019s\nFelix, in which Mr McAloon criticised the Make Poverty History\ncampaign and the plans for a rally\nin Edinburgh to coincide with the\nG8 finance ministers meeting.\nMr McAloon seems to have missed\nthe point of the campaign \u2013 which\nis that the deaths of some thirty\nthousand children every day from\nextreme poverty is totally unaccept-able. Poverty can be stopped \u2013 it is\nwithin the powers of the G8 finance\nministers to help Africa. To cancel its crippling debts; to increase\naid and to make trade rules fairer\nfor African countries. The governments of the developed nations have\nrepeatedly failed to do this because\nthey do not see it as a high enough\npriority. They have failed to stop this\nsuffering because, in their eyes, the\nmoney is better spent elsewhere.\nOur campaign aims to show world\nleaders that the people of this country do indeed care about the people\nof another \u2013 by whatever means\nare necessary. That is why we will\ngather in Edinburgh on the 2nd\nJuly, whether it is convenient for Mr\nMcAloon or not. That is also why we\nwill wear bands on our wrists \u2013 to\nadvertise our campaign that others\nmay find out more and join, not to\nflaunt our altruism as Mr McAloon\nassumes. I would urge all to visit\nwww.makepovertyhistory.org and\njoin, because if you never make\nyour views heard then nothing will\never change. Personal donations\nare indeed an essential part of helping the third world \u2013 as Mr McAloon\ngraciously acknowledges \u2013 but this\ncampaign asks only for your voice.\nIt asks you not to help Africa quietly,\nas Mr McAloon suggests, but shout-ing; shouting so loud that they can\nhear it all the way in Gleneagles. Do\nplease stand up and be heard.\nAidan Russell\nResponding to the\nglobal warming sceptic\nDear Felix,\nI was interested to see the interview\nwith Piers Corbyn in last week\u2019s\nFelix. Your article included two photographs of him: as a student politi-cian, and as a sceptical scientist\nopposing the consenus on climate\nchange. It is very appealing to imagine that Piers might be a lone voice\nof truth arguing against the vested\ninterests of a corrupt establishment\n\u2013 but it is important to remember\nthat Pier\u2019s track record is much\nmore as a politician than a scien-tist. The question about whether we\nshould respond to global warning\nby altering green house gas emission is one of the most important\nquestions facing the world at the\nmoment. There is now a rather fragile scientific and political concensus\non this issue which Piers wants to\nend. Whether or not Piers is right is\na very important question.\nPiers is a very convincing speak-er, and has a great skill at getting people at a public meeting to\nback his view against that of \u201cthe\nestablishment\u201d. As an example,\ntwo years ago, Piers was very successful at bringing a \u00a3800million\nredevelopment of one of London\u2019s\nworst estates (the Ayelsbury in\nSouthwark) to a grinding halt, by\ncatalizing a campaign against it on\nthe grounds that the proposed pub-lic-private partnership constituted\n\u201cprivatization\u201d of the estate. I\u2019m\nsure he is very proud of his achieve-ment, but the results? Not a better\nestate, but one that continues to\nhave the same old problems, and\nmost pertinantly to me a lost opportunity to rebuild my local secondary\nschool, that is languishing at the\nbottom of the league tables and\ndesparately in need of investment.\nPiers certainly has the ability to sow\nmistrust and stop things happening\n\u2013 but as we consider Pier\u2019s views on\nglobal warming, we must make sure\nwe are doing so on the basis of the\nscience, not his rhetoric about vested interested and conspiracies. And\nI personally am far from convinced\nthat his scentific track record merits taking him seriously.\nProfessor DH,\nImperial College Physics 1984-87\n(Full name supplied)\nLetters to the Editor\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "EXHIBITION\nYou would have to try exceptionally hard to miss the hype around\nthe new Frida Kahlo exhibition at\nthe Tate Modern. It\u2019s everywhere\n\u2013 newspapers, glossy magazines,\ntelevision and posters around town.\nThe thing is, after the period a\nfew years ago when Mexico was the\n\u2018fashionable\u2019 country to visit, and\nthen the Salma Hayek biopic, Frida\nhas come back with vengeance.\nShe\u2019s a quirky fashion-pack favour-ite, feminist and left wing activists\nadopt her as their own (she did after\nall belong to the Communist Party\nand was a very independent woman\ngiven the standards of the time).\nHer paintings fetch the highest prices by any female artist and her work\nis collected by celebrities.\nThe show at the Tate Modern collects an impressive array of Kahlo\u2019s\nwork \u2013 there are 62 paintings and\nnumerous sketches. There are\npaintings loaned from numerous\nmuseums in Mexico as well as from\nprivate collectors such as Madonna.\nAlso included are sketches and pencil drawings as well as some watercolours which show yet another\nfacet of the artist\u2019s style \u2013 her watercolours are almost unrecognisable\nas the work of the same woman.\nThe contents are arranged primarily in chronological order but with\nsome rooms dedicated to a certain\ntheme, such as self-portraiture and\nstill-life paintings. The exhibition\u2019s\ncurators have done well in adopting this scheme as it allows for a\ngood examination of the development of the artist\u2019s style. However,\nmuch of the explanatory tags and\nso forth accompanying the exhibits\noften reek of over-analysis of the\nworks by parties not having a proper\nunderstanding of the culture that\ninfluenced the artist so strongly.\nThe general spouting of rubbish\nregarding Kahlo\u2019s art, life and influences is regrettably not limited to\nthe official gallery blurbs \u2013 both The\nTimes and The Independent have\ncarried sadly pretentious articles\nand the coverage given by the BBC\nwas laughably inaccurate, showcasing the corporation\u2019s employees\u2019 inability to even read a press\nrelease.\nThe impact on Kahlo\u2019s art of being\nmixed race is over-emphasised\n(pretty much every Mexican is part\nEuropean and part indigenous),\nwhere in fact more focus should\nreally be placed on her passion for\nher country and its culture. She\nis criticised for being narcissistic,\nusing herself as the subject many\nof her paintings; she was, after all,\noften bedridden and the wife of a\nbrilliant, though womanising, fellow\nartist, she spent most of her time\nalone. She painted what she knew\nbest and what was at hand \u2013 her-self.\nKahlo (1907-1954) began painting after suffering a hideous road\naccident in 1925 (I\u2019d rather not go\ninto the specifics, as just thinking\nabout it makes me nauseous), to\nallay terminal boredom. The second\nroom of the exhibition is dedicated\nto the paintings of this early period\nof exploration and development of\nstyle and themes \u2013 the works of the\n1920s are remarkably different from\nthose of the more mature Kahlo.\nHer painting style, particularly in\noils, changed dramatically after she\nmet and later married the already\nlarger than life muralist legend\nDiego Rivera. Her experiences as\nhis wife and his influence and guidance on her work are clearly vis-ible. The period spent with her husband in the United States led her to\nbecome \u2018more Mexican\u2019 as she felt\nhomesick and out of place, and also\nadded to her list of personal tragedies as she suffered a miscarriage.\nKahlo\u2019s art is essentially a reflection of her life and her feelings\ntowards herself and those in her life;\nher art is not complicated, as many\nwould encourage you to believe,\nit is raw. She paints of her happy\nmoments, Frida Kahlo y Diego\nRivera (1931) on the event of her\nwedding, and her almost constant\nsadness and pain, La columna rota\n(1944).\nThe work collected for the show\nis very wide ranging and does allow\nfor a real insight into the life of Frida\nKahlo. Most interesting to see are\nher changing attitudes to herself\nand Rivera. These are clearly documented by the numerous names\nshe uses when signing her paint-ings; they reflect periods of love\nand loathing and of finally coming\nto terms with herself as a person.\nHer issues are not so much of an\nidentity crisis arising from a mixed\nheritage \u2013 she chooses to call herself by her more Germanic name,\nFrida, instead of Carmen while her\ndressing reflected the regional costume of different parts of Mexico\n\u2013 but more from problems she had\nin accepting herself as an individual\nin a physically damaged state.\nThe exhibition is thoroughly interesting and is also a unique chance\nto see so much of Kahlo\u2019s work\ncollected in one place. She remains\nan iconic figure within Mexico and\nher family home, La Casa Azul in\nCoyoac\u00e1n, as well as the home she\nshared with Diego Rivera in San\nAngel, (both are suburbs of Mexico\nCity these days), are preserved and\nopen to the public.\nA parting word: please avoid buying any of the Mexican handicrafts\non sale at the Tate Modern. You will\nbe royally ripped off and a trip to\nMexico would be far more rewarding anyway.

We were there as guests of\nmembers of the Student Council\nof Delft Technical University, one\nof the four members of the \u2018IDEA\nLeague\u2019, at a conference of student\nrepresentatives.\nThe IDEA League is a strategic\nalliance between Imperial College\nLondon, TU Delft, ETH Z\u00fcrich and\nRWTH Aachen; these four technological universities are committed to\nthe highest international standards\nin both research and education. The\nLeague aims to increase collaboration between the institutions and\nfacilitate student mobility.\nEstablished in 1999, the IDEA\nLeague has hitherto only been utilised by the highest level of pol-icy-makers within the institutions\n\u2013 whilst we were in Delft the Rector\nwas meeting his counterparts at a\nmonastery in Zurich \u2013 and as the\nbasis for an annual sports tourna-ment.\nOur colleagues in Delft had identified that the League could also\nbe exploited by student representa-tives, in order to enhance the quality of representation on matters of\nEuropean significance, and to open\nup the IDEA League to a higher\nlevel of student participation. They\nstarted this process back in January\nwhen they visited the three other\ninstitutions on a \u2018Grand Tour\u2019.\nAlright for some! They were investigating factors which affect duration\nof study, since the average length of\nstudy in Delft is 7.2 years, and there\nis increasing political pressure to\nreduce this. Government intervention in higher education (usually to\nsave money) was a common theme\nthat emerged. Delft since decided to\nhost this conference to get everyone\ntogether for two days to discuss pertinent issues.\nSome interesting contrasts came\nout of the conference; it appears that\nImperial and Delft are leading the\nfield when it comes to quality assur-ance. All those hours I have spent in\nCollege \u2018scrutiny\u2019 committees (with\nseemingly limited powers) seemed\nworthwhile when I found out that\nrepresentatives at Zurich appear to\nhave very limited capacity to monitor the quality of education and suggest improvements.\nWe had much interesting discussion about the Bologna process,\nwhich is a move by governments all\nover Europe to harmonise the structure of higher education to allow\ngreater student mobility and more\nwidespread mutual recognition of\ndegrees. They seemed to know a lot\nmore about it than us, since the rest\nof Europe is adopting the AngloSaxon Bachelor\u2019s/Master\u2019s system,\nso changes to date in Britain have\ntaken place behind the scenes. In\nparticular, the Germans seem to\nresent these alterations.\nProbably the most significant\nthing we achieved was a date for the\nnext conference! I also gracefully\nvolunteered next year\u2019s sabbaticals\n(who were represented by Sameena\nMisbahuddin, President elect, and\nSarah Khatib, my successor) to host\nthe event in July. It took quite a lot of\ntime to converge the diaries of four\nvery different institutions with different exam dates, different officer\nterms, and other complications.\nWe also managed to agree on draft\naims and objectives, and a few of\nthe projects which we would like\nthe alliance to work on, and set\nrealistic target completion dates.\nWe decided on a name: my suggestion of \u2018IDEALiStiC\u2019 \u2013 IDEA League\nStudent Council \u2013 was, rather sur-prisingly, accepted. We identified\npossibilities for cultural exchanges\nbetween societies from member\ninstitutions, and decided that we\nwanted to lobby our institutions to\norganize a summer school to raise\nstudent awareness of, and participation in, the League. We also tasked\nZurich with setting up a website for\nthe alliance.\nPossibly the most enjoyable part\nof the trip was experiencing life in\nanother (very different) university\ntown. Delft is a small city characterised by the proliferation of canals\nand bicycles. The people are very\nwelcoming, and things seem a bit\nmore laid back than London. We\nalso experienced student life in\nDelft \u2013 one evening, we did a tour of\nsome of the \u2018student associations\u2019,\nwhich seemed to be founded on the\nprinciples of cheap food, free-flow-ing beer, a very strict pecking order\nand humiliating initiations!\nDutch universities don\u2019t have\nautomatic-membership unions in\nthe British sense, so the student\nassociations really underpin the students\u2019 social life. There appeared to\nbe a great sense of camaraderie, and\nloyalty to the associations, which\nImperial College Union could only\ndream of experiencing. Best of all,\nof course, was the superb hospitality\nextended to us by our hosts, and the\nfriendship between all the delegates\nwhich was formed very quickly.\nSo, what\u2019s the message? Britain\nis only a tiny island, I guess. There\nare other things going on in other\nplaces and it\u2019s about time we got out\nof our silo and started talking to our\nneighbours! I was pleased with what\nwe managed to get out of the event,\nand I wish the alliance the best of\nluck next year.\nWhat a good IDEA!\nUnion Deputy President Sam Rorke visited Delft in Holland for a conference of student\nrepresentatives from four European universities\nAs I stood there at the starting\npoint, heart beating, heavy breathing and nerves on the edge, I awaited the starting signal. Over 8000\npeople were gathered just before\nthe Serpentine Bridge, just as eager\nto start the race. All that training, all\nthe talk, it was all down to this. The\nsiren went, we were off.\nIt all started in January, with my\nsister introducing me to the idea.\nI have never participated in a real\nrace in my life (that\u2019s if you exclude\nthe 1 mile fun-run I did in Primary\nschool. Man that was tough!)\nThe BUPA 10km race in Hyde\nPark was the perfect motivation factor to get me back into shape and\njogging again. All too often we use\nthe excuse of work to prevent us\nfrom improving oneself physically.\nThus, I entered the race along with\nmy sister as \u2018Reem Team\u2019 (eeem\nmeaning a type of deer or gazelle\nin Arabic). The race was organised\nby 95.8 Capital FM radio along with\nBUPA, and all the money collected\nfrom sponsorship went to Help a\nLondon Child (a charity run by the\nstation).\nSo early February, while normal\nhuman beings were still sleeping\nin their lovely warm beds, I was out\nin Gunnersbury Park bursting my\nlungs. Each day saw more improve-ment, quicker time, and longer dis-tances. It was a struggle but I knew\nit was going to pay off at the end.\nThe day of the race had finally\narrived, Sunday 5 June. At 8am we\nset off for Hyde Park for the long\nawaited race. At 9.30am there were\nseveral hundred people gathered in\nthe park, but the number soon grew\nto thousands by 10am. There were\nyoung and old, male and female, fit\nand unfit. A stage had been erected\nfor the DJs to entertain the crowd.\nThe warm up session started at\n10, and I can tell you that it was a\nlot harder than I could have imag-ined, leaving me with a stitch before\nthe race had even begun. Then the\nhordes of runners filed towards the\nstarting line and Richard Bacon\n(formerly of Blue Peter) sounded\nthe starting siren. We were off, going\nacross the Serpentine Bridge before\nrunning along the Serpentine.\nI had my mp3 player in my ears\nwith the Rocky theme music and\nI felt really good. The first 2km\nwere pretty easy. The course then\nled us around the edge of Hyde\nPark, before coming back towards\nthe Serpentine, then along the edge\nof Hyde Park again. Large crowds\nof people had gathered along the\nrace course. Some were taking pic-tures, some cheering, and others\nclapping. Every kilometre seemed\nlike a few miles. I kept running, just\ndreaming of the 5km mark where\nthey would be providing us with\nwater. The most testing time was\nthe 6 to 8km section, where I hit the\ninfamous psychological wall (every\nexperienced runner should know\nabout that, though for them 6 to 8km\nwould be a breeze).\nThe final kilometre took us across\nthe lake before the long stretch\nalongside the Serpentine. This was\nthe part where I forgot that my\nmuscles had stopped working and\nthat I was no longer able to breathe\nproperly. I became a mad man near\nthe end, giving it my all. Whatever\nit took, I was going to reach my\ntarget of one hour. The long stretch\nseemed to go on forever, but bit by\nbut I was getting closer. Just as I\nthought I had nothing left in the\ntank I crossed the line with my\nwhole body in agony.\nDespite all my training I did find\nthe course quite tough, as did the\nother runners. The majority of the\ncourse had a gradient that meant\ntwice the workload. However, this\ndid not prevent me from reaching\nmy target of 1 hour (my time was\n59min and 43sec). I came in at position 2792 out of over 8000 people.\nThe other Reem Team member (my\nsis) came in at 1hr and 29sec (pretty\nimpressive). As I passed the finishing line the satisfaction I felt was\nimmeasurable. I did it! I had finished a whole 10km race for the first\ntime. I had my medal in my hand\nand a bottle of water, perfect!\nThe warm down then started at\n12noon before the award ceremony\nfor the fastest runners. The fastest\nmale had a time of 36min and 28sec,\nand the fastest female 36min and\n49sec. However, the most notable\nprize went to the wackiest fancy\ndress, a man who wore a Darth\nVadar outfit (that must have been\nterribly uncomfortable).\nMany of you would think that you\nneed to be super fit to run in any\nrace but the reality is that it is possible for anyone. All you need is\nmotivation and a will to go all the\nway. Since the event is right at the\ndoorstep of Imperial, it should be a\nperfect occasion for many of us students to take part in. Next year you\ncan join in as a group or individually.\nIt is a great way to keep fit, collect\nsome money for charity, and have\na wonderful time. Go and find those\nold trainers, wipe the dust off and\nstart jogging. I expect to see more\nfamiliar faces next year!\nAnd they\u2019re off\nImperial student Mustaffa Junaid took part in the BUPA 10km run in Hyde Park\nMustaffa Junaid proudly shows\noff his medal after completing the\n10km run\nTop: Delft Technical University.

We asked how the Council of an academic institution could govern effectively\nwithout representatives from the student\npopulation.\nMustafa Arif, President of Imperial\nCollege Union, called the proposals \u201cmisguided\u201d and told Felix: \u201cStudents are the\nmost important stakeholders in higher edu-cation. Council is there to hold management\nto account over the College\u2019s long term\nstrategy. The College\u2019s future depends on\nattracting and retaining the best students,\nso student representatives should be able\nto contribute to that process.\u201d\nStudents were successful in lobbying\nagainst the change, and three weeks later\nit was decided that the Union President\nwould remain a member of the Council\nafter all. However, the number of elected\nmembers of academic staff on the governing body was cut from six to one.\nFuture of Wye campus in doubt\nLast summer, Imperial College announced\nplans to transfer most courses away from\nthe Wye campus, close the department\nof Agricultural Sciences and consider the\nfuture of the campus in a review.\nThe Department of Agricultural Sciences,\nwhich is wholly based at Wye, was making a\nloss of \u00a31.8m per year. Professor Sir Leszek\nBorysiewicz, the Deputy Rector designate,\nsaid: \u201cThe Faculty of Life Sciences\u2019 presence at the Wye campus in its current configuration is not economically viable.\u201d\nThe College insisted that students starting courses at Wye up to and including 2005\nwould not be affected, but in an interview\nwith Felix in May, Professor Borysiewicz\ntold us that prospective students in agricultural sciences would have to look elsewhere\nand he could not guarantee that current\nstudents would complete their courses at\nWye.\nUndergraduate teaching will continue at Wye, but only in Applied Business\nManagement.\nFormer Prodigy star assaults student at Union\nAn Imperial student was assaulted in dBs\nby Keith Flint, the former Prodigy vocalist,\nand two other men.\nMr Flint, 35, and his new band Clever\nBrains Fryin\u2019, played live at the Union\nas part of Freshers Week. During their\nperformance, the student, who does not\nwish to be named, was apparently dancing the \u2018macarena\u2019 in front of the stage.\nThis may have offended the band members.\nAccording to witnesses, Mr Flint and two\nof his colleagues then jumped down off the\nstage and began to punch the student, who\nwas left with cuts and bruises to the head\nand face.\nLater that night, police officers questioned the band members and the student,\nwho eventually decided not to press charg-es. According to a senior Union source, the\npolice were prepared to make arrests at the\nscene for actual bodily harm.\nThe assault was an isolated incident in\nan otherwise successful Freshers Week for\nImperial College Union.\nImperial ranked world\u2019s 14th best university\nImperial College appeared in 14th place in\na list of the best universities in the world,\ncompiled by The Times Higher Education\nSupplement and published in November.\nHarvard University, in Massachusetts,\ntook first place by a considerable margin.\nSeven of the top ten institutions in the list\nwere American.\nImperial was ranked fourth among UK\nuniversities, behind Oxford, Cambridge and\nthe London School of Economics. The only\nother European university in the top 20 was\nETH Zurich, Switzerland, in tenth place.\nMustafaArif,PresidentofImperialCollege\nUnion, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for\nImperial students, when they graduate, to\nhave the value of their degrees recognised\nby employers across the world\u201d.\nIn an interview with Felix in May, the\nRector, Sir Richard Sykes, said that\n\u201cImperial has done extremely well\u201d to be\nranked so highly. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feat when\nyou think we\u2019re not even 100 years old,\u201d he\nadded.\nDepartments break rules on working hours\nIn November, Felix revealed that students\nin a number of College departments were\nhaving to attend lectures and tutorials at\ntimes supposedly reserved for humanities\nclasses and lunch breaks.\nAccording to the Imperial College website,\n\u201con Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and\nFridays in the autumn and spring terms\nthere is a two-hour break at midday for the\nlunch-hour Humanities Programme\u201d.\nHowever, some students had regular lec-tures, tutorials or labs between noon and\n2pm. In the worst cases, first year students\nattended lectures and classes continuously\nfrom 10am until 6pm in the autumn term.\nStudents in aeronautics, chemistry, electrical engineering and information systems\nengineering were among those affected.\nProfessor Rees Rawlings, the Pro Rector\nfor Educational Quality, told Felix that he\nwas disappointed to hear about the issue,\ncontinuing: \u201cThe situation is quite clear.\nCertain times of day should be kept free for\nthese activities. By now, all departments\nshould be aware of this and timetable their\nactivities accordingly.\u201d\nThe problems have since been solved in\nsome cases, but a significant number of\nstudents still have classes timetabled in the\n\u2018no-go\u2019 areas of lunchtimes and Wednesday\nafternoons.\n\u201cStudents need to bring the examples to\nthe Union so they can be brought to me,\u201d\nsaid Rawlings in an interview in May.\nPay problems for student staff\nStudents who work part time for Imperial\nCollege suffered serious problems receiving their pay between October and March.\nDespite opposition from the Union, weekly\npay was scrapped in the autumn term, with\nthe College imposing a monthly pay system.\nStudent staff complained about a range of\nissues, including a lack of communication,\ninsufficient compensation payments, short\nnotice, incorrect tax deductions and the fact\nthat some non-student staff were still being\npaid weekly. Some workers even quit their\njobs as a result.\nThe change was made in order to cut\ncosts and make it easier to co-ordinate pay-ments. However, under considerable pres-sure, the College reversed the decision and\nreintroduced weekly pay from 1 March.\nMalcolm Aldridge, the College\u2019s Financial\nController, admitted: \u201cPaying students on\na monthly cycle was leading to recruitment\nproblems in our organisation.\u201d\nHigh turnout as election results announced\nThe turnout in this year\u2019s Imperial College\nUnion sabbatical elections reached a record\nhigh of more than 2800 votes \u2013 over 22% of\nthe student body.\nMustafa Arif, the current President,\nexpressed his pleasure at the turnout, say-ing: \u201cThe Union is now in a much stronger\nposition to legitimately represent students\nthan at any time in its history.\u201d\nSameena Misbahuddin, the current\nDeputy President (Finance and Services)\nwas elected as President, overcoming her\nnearest challenger Morten Olesen by 1126\nvotes to 862 after the other candidates\u2019\nvotes had been reallocated.\nMiss Misbahuddin told Felix: \u201cI was\ndelighted to be voted President and I\u2019m\nlooking forward to it immensely. There\u2019s a\nlot of work ahead, as always, but I\u2019ll do my\nvery best to justify the faith of those who\nsupported me.\u201d\nThe Deputy Presidents will be Tim Aplin,\nSimon Matthews and Sarah Khatib. Rupert\nNeate will be next year\u2019s Felix editor.\nPresident survives confidence votes\nThe President of Imperial College Union,\nMustafa Arif, survived two votes of confidence this year.\nIn October, he offered his resignation\nbut then withdrew it a day later. Having\noriginally written in an email, \u201cI no longer\nbelieve that I am up to the job,\u201d Mr Arif\nquickly changed his mind and told us: \u201cIt is\nin the best interests of the Union that I continue in office and serve out the remainder\nof my term.\u201d\nThen, in March, physics postgraduate\nTom Tibbits brought a second motion of\nno confidence to Union Council, alleging\nthat Mr Arif was guilty of bad manage-ment, intimidation, a lack of communica-tion, and steamrollering through various\nhigh-level changes without the approval of\nthe relevant committees. Mr Arif called it\n\u201csilliness\u201d.\nAfter almost three hours of deliberation,\nthe President remained in post when only\neight members voted in favour of dismissing him.\n\n"

The Union\u2019s facilities\nwill be severely disrupted for\nat least six months and the\nproject will cost several million pounds, but the process\nshould bring huge benefits\nfor students in future years.\nIn last term\u2019s online survey,\n68% of students were in favour\nof improving or refurbishing Beit. The Union Council\nthis week agreed to support\na proposal to take forward\nplanning work on the project,\nwhich could revolutionise the\nUnion building and its facili-ties. However, some delegates\nsuggested that changes in the\nmanagement of current facilities could be more effective\nthan a complete overhaul.\nThe plans have not been\nfinalised \u2013 a working group\nwill review them over the\nsummer, student feedback\nwill be sought in the autumn\nterm and the Council is due\nto sign off final proposals in\nDecember.\nSome likely changes\ninclude revitalising the tired-looking main entrance and\nstairwell, increasing use of\nthe north entrance next to\nthe Royal Albert Hall, moving\nthe Student Activities Centre\nto the main building, putting\nin large doors so that the two\nmain bars open onto the Quad,\nrefurbishing the Union Bar,\nand building a new lounge\nbar on the first floor. Union\nofficers are considering these\nand many other alterations\nas part of a flexible plan from\ntheir appointed architects.\nSameena Misbahuddin, the\nUnion\u2019s Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), told\nFelix: \u201cStudents deserve a\nmuch better Union building.\nThe refurbishment will give\nbetter facilities for student\nactivities and better social\nfacilities. Students will be\nproud of the new Union\nbuilding.\u201d\nThe entire redevelopment\nproject could cost anything\nbetween \u00a33m and \u00a310m,\ndepending on which options\nare chosen. Funding could\ncome from the College\u2019s\ncatering and conferences\nreview, which has recommended investing \u00a37m to\n\u00a38m into bar and catering\nfacilities across the South\nKensington campus. In the\npast, the College has allowed\nthe Union to borrow funds for\nmajor projects on an interest free basis. Also, the new\nbuilding should have greater commercial potential,\nallowing some of the cost to\nbe repaid over time.\nSome aspects of the proposals could be controver-sial. The architects\u2019 plans\nfor rebranding the Union are\nunlikely to be well received by\nImperial\u2019s conservative student body. Meanwhile, during the refurbishment, there\ncould be no sports facilities or\ndrinking areas at all.\nHowever, the project could\ncreate a modern building\nfocused on students\u2019 needs,\nmoving Imperial\u2019s recreational facilities in line with\nthe College\u2019s reputation as\none of the world\u2019s premier\nuniversities.\nFurther details on the redevelopment plans are available\nat www.union.ic.ac.uk.\n\u25cf Comment, page 10\nThe Union\u2019s refurbishment plans for Beit Quad include making more use of the north\nentrance opposite the Royal Albert Hall, as demonstrated in this architect\u2019s drawing\n\u201cStudents deserve\na much better Union\nbuilding...\u201d\nBy Dave Edwards\nFelix has learnt that College\nofficials have found a potential location for a replacement\nfor Southside Bar.\nThe popular bar will close\nits doors for the final time on\n24 June, shortly before the\nSouthside building is demol-ished.

Luckily we had our\nown Essex Wideboy to see\nthat we safely made our way\nfrom Black Horse Road tube\nto the pitches in a fleet of taxis\nwithout getting run over by\nboy racers in their modified\nFord Escorts.\nWe arrived in true Imperial\nfashion just before push-back\nfor our first game, thus negating the need for a warm-up\nas has become traditional.\nHowever, I was reliably\ninformed by the Old Loughts\ngroundsman that Brandon\nLee (who had made his own\nway there) had been at the\ngates at 7.30am to practice his\ndrag-flicks from shot corners.\nDidn\u2019t anyone tell him that\ngirls have to have the first\nstrike in mixed? Oh well.\nMore importantly we only\nhad 10 players, which doesn\u2019t\nmake a team. Fortunately\nPikey\u2019s skills at chatting\nup young girls and Essex\nWideboy\u2019s charm in being at\nhis home club meant that we\nmanaged to get two girls from\nOld Loughts to play for us\nthroughout the day. Thanks to\nVicki and Laura!\nThe first match was une-ventful, largely because we\nwere all sluggish and they\nwere rubbish. We scored\nfirst as Moony, our very own\nlady in pink, coolly slotted\nhome from the tightest of\nangles. We weathered their\ncomeback storm with Sieve\nimpressive in goal and Sarah\nC, Spanner and the Italian\nJob forming a solid defence.\nHowever, a short period\nof sloppy play lead to the\nRedbridge Redskins equalis-ing. (Sounds like something\nout of a Budweiser ad doesn\u2019t\nit.) Unfortunately there was\nno added-time multi-ball,\nmuch to our disappointment,\nso the game ended 1-1. One\npoint to start.\nThe second game was\nagainst a team calling themselves Welcome. We played\nthis game on the water-based pitch rather than the\nusual sand. We won 2-0 with\ngoals from Pikey and Essex\nWideboy who, along with\nStoner Tom, dominated the\nmidfield. Too Keen kept us all\nfresh by subbing on and off,\nshowing some nice touches.\nOur final game was against\none of the Old Lought\u2019s teams.\nThe less said about the game\nthe better. It ended in a 0-0\nstalemate though not for a\nlack of trying and the fact that\nthe Old Lought\u2019s team had\nan awesome goalkeeper who\nturned out to be a bit of stunner when she took her helmet\noff, according to Sieve.\nSo we had five points at\nthe end of the group games,\nwhich put us in second place\nin the table, meaning that we\nprogressed through to the\nCup playoffs. As a result, in\nour minds we were already\nwinners. Just as well, because\nthe team we drew in the\nsemis was Mill Hill who had\nthrashed all the teams in their\ngroup.\nThe game was excellent,\nalthough our efforts were\nsomewhat thwarted by Essex\nWideboy who decided to slice\na free hit into Pikey\u2019s knee\nand the fact that they had\na \u2018supposed\u2019 national league\nplayer in their team. The final\nscore was a 2-0 defeat, though\nin true Imperial fashion we\nnever gave up fighting, especially Moony who had an awesome bitch at the rather large\nfemale umpire. Mill Hill went\non to win the tournament so\nwe lost to the best team, obvi-ously!\nFor lots more on Imperial\u2019s\nHockey Club, including loads\nof pictures, check out www.\nimperialhockey.co.uk.\nHockey successes in Essex\nHOCKEY\nby Fishface\nselves Welcome.

Southside\nBar is one of the very few things that\nhelp Imperial maintain a passing\nresemblance to a \u2018normal\u2019 university\u2019s social atmosphere.\nWhen I was researching for my\noriginal story on the closure of\nSouthside (Felix 1321), Mustafa Arif,\nUnion President, had a lot of excuses as to why Southside managed\nto pack in the punters every night\nof the week while the Union bars\nremained empty.\nHis main reason was that the\nrugby team only frequent Southside\nbecause their honorary president,\nRoger Pownall, is the bar manag-er. This may account for some of\nthe Southside patrons, but I highly\ndoubt that most of Southside\u2019s loyal\ncustomers have any idea who Mr\nPownall is. I certainly didn\u2019t.\nI was out with some mates last\nFriday, and for a reason that escapes\nme now, we decided to go to the\nUnion. But Chav Night at the Union\nhad a door price of \u00a33, so we decided against. Everyone knows Union\nnights have been dreadful this year,\nso charging people who are trying\nto give it a go really isn\u2019t the way\nforward. \u00a33 may not sound like a lot,\nbut compare it to \u00a35 at Kings, UCL\nand LSE, where you actually have\nfun and which draw students from\nall across London.\nInstead we headed to Southside,\nwhich was rammed. The bar, TV\nroom and even caf\u00e9 area upstairs\nwere all occupied. Meanwhile, I\u2019m\ntold Chav night was so unpopular\nthat dBs bar closed early. \u201cThere\nwas nobody in there,\u201d according to a\nUnion steward.\nThe situation is only set to get\nworse \u2013 all Union bars are set to\nclose sometime in the Summer term\nnext year, perhaps as early as the\nstart of the Easter holidays. This\nwill mean there will be no undergraduate bars anywhere on campus!\nDoes the Union lack any concept of\nforesight? How could the Union possibly consider the \u2013 albeit much over\ndue \u2013 refurbishment of Beit Quad at\na time when there will be no alternative places to go for a drink?\nThe issue I find most staggering\nin the Southside Bar saga is that\nthe president of our Union, Mustafa\nArif, turned down the College\u2019s suggestion of moving Southside bar\ninto an extended Linstead bar. He\nsaid that this would be \u201cunfair on\nLinstead students as they would\nhave no private communal space\u201d.\nBut, having been a resident of two\ndifferent halls myself and chatting\nto others, there is definitely much\nbetter hall bonding and atmosphere\nin halls that have bars.\nIt may be the case that students\nwho do not drink feel they cannot\nsocialise in bars, but, not to wanting\nto over-generalise, these students\nare hardly the most sociable whatever the situation.\nThis travesty of Southside\u2019s closure should not be allowed to take\nplace, at least without a little bit\nmore of a public fight. Three thousand signatures is a good start. I\u2019m\nsure that at another university if\nthe \u2018powers that be\u2019 attempted to\nclose down the most popular bar on\ncampus there would be some kind\nof uprising. The apathy of students\nat Imperial is incredible \u2013 no-one\ngives a shit about anything, even\nthings that will greatly affect them\nnext year.\nSouthside halls were designed\nspecifically to prevent student riots.\nEven in my wildest imagination I\ncannot think of any cause against\nwhich we Imperial students would\nriot. Perhaps the library not being\nopen 24 hours any more?!\nThe Neighbours generation\nby RUPERT NEATE\nGot some free time next year?\nCome and join Felix!\nWe need people to contribute to every aspect of putting your student\nnewspaper together \u2013 reporters, columnists, editors, reviewers, proof\nreaders, photographers, puzzle setters... the list goes on.\nIt looks great on your CV and there are lots of freebies to be had.\nContact next year\u2019s editor now at rupert.neate@imperial.ac.uk\nAlso... want to pose for page 3?

Despite receiving criticism for his\nhandling of a number of important issues,\nhe was elected with a substantial majority on both occasions and comfortably\nsurvived an attempt to \u2018sack\u2019 him last\nterm.\nA 25-year-old graduate in Information\nSystems Engineering, Arif claims to work\nupwards of 80 hours per week on a regular basis in his role as President. I managed to find a spare hour in his schedule\nto discover his views on a range of subjects such as higher education funding\nmethods and the controversial closure of\nSouthside Bar.\nArif decided to study engineering in\n1997 because of his interests in science\nand business. He says he \u201cwasn\u2019t posh\nenough\u201d for Cambridge, and Imperial\ncame highly recommended, though not\nfor the usual reasons:\n\u201cMy physics teacher, who I had a bit of\na crush on, used to work behind the bar\nin Da Vinci\u2019s and she told me I\u2019d fit in\nperfectly at Imperial because they were\nmostly spotty and wore glasses.\u201d\nHe wanted to be President \u201cever since\nthe first year welcome meeting where I\nremember Natasha Newton (President\n1999-2000) getting up on the stage, and\nyes, I probably had a bit of a crush on her\nas well. Then in my fourth year issues\nlike tuition fees and the proposed merger\nwith UCL made it seem quite interesting,\nand I thought I could probably cope with\nbeing President.\u201d\nArif found his first year in the job \u201cfrustrating\u201d, as it was \u201cdifficult to get things\ndone\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any sabbaticals really\nappreciate until they\u2019re elected just how\nmany external constraints there are,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cEven with the best will in the\nworld you often can\u2019t do what you set out\nto achieve.\u201d\nHe tells me that the impending departure of the Union manager (Mandy\nHurford, who retired in summer 2004)\nmeant that it was impossible to start any\nnew major projects when he started the\njob in August 2003. \u201cTo be elected and\nthen realise that you can\u2019t do what you\npromised to do, what people elected you\nto do, is very galling. To some extent,\ndespite my manifesto being focused on\ndeveloping the Union\u2019s services, I spent\nmy time not doing that but instead\nraising the profile of campaigns and representation\u2026 and I don\u2019t think we did a\nbad job.\u201d\nThe next Union manager \u2013 or\nPermanent Secretary, as he was officially\nknown \u2013 has recently left the Union after\nless than a year. I put it to Arif that this\ndeparture will cause similar problems.\nHe argues that the organisation is\nnow better equipped to cope with such\nchanges: \u201cI think things are quite messy\nwith the departure of the Permanent\nSecretary, but we\u2019re in a change mode,\nwe\u2019re not in a static mode. We\u2019re still\npushing the big priorities forward, and I\nthink we\u2019re coping.\u201d\nTop-up fees\nAn outspoken critic of the National Union\nof Students (NUS), Arif places much of\nthe blame for the introduction of university top-up fees at their door.\n\u201cThe battle was lost in 1997 when the\nNUS gave their support to the Labour\nGovernment to introduce their original\ntuition fees of \u00a31000 per year,\u201d he says.\n\u201cEveryone in the university business\nknew that that was the indication that\nfree education would stop, a fee would\nbe set, sooner or later the fee would rise,\nand sooner or later universities would be\nallowed to vary it. The debate was lost\nby the NUS, who for their own political\ninterests supported the Government at\nthe time.\u201d\nHe believes that there is over-supply of\nuniversity education in Britain, \u201cbecause\npeople seem to want a degree when it\nmight not necessarily be of benefit to\nthem. A lot of people who go to university these days are just using it as a\nmiddle-class finishing school.\u201d He brings\nup a MORI opinion poll from 2002 which\nshowed that \u201cpublic opinion was against\nthe 50% education target and would prefer real education for a more defined\nset.\u201d\nAnd his personal view? Is there a solution to the fees problem in the current\npolitical climate?\n\u201cMy view is that, given the situation of\nthe past few years, the only way we\u2019re\ngoing to get back to a sensible number\nof people doing degrees is if we do have\na market for tuition fees. Inevitably the\n\u00a33000 cap is going to rise, and I think\neventually it could become unregulated,\nbut what I think we would need is a system of state scholarships to fund tuition\nas well as living costs. Others who want\nto do it when there is no academic benefit\ncan pay the whole way. You then wouldn\u2019t\nhave such a burden on the taxpayer.\u201d\nSouthside Bar\nThe decision to close \u2013 and not replace\n\u2013 Southside Bar in just over a week\u2019s\ntime has been met with disappoinment\nand anger by students, staff and others\nwho value the award-winning venue. The\nPresident has been attacked for rejecting the College\u2019s proposal to move the\nbar into Linstead Hall, and for not doing\nenough to find an alternative location\nfor Southside Bar after it the building is\ndemolished.\n\u201cI do think we need to get this into perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a long term\nproblem. There will be a bar in the new\nLinstead [though not for several years],\nand the Union will be redeveloped so that\nwe have a pub-type environment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need a direct replacement for Southside Bar... but with the\nredevelopment of Beit we\u2019re looking at\nsomething like a 12 to 18 month project,\nand if that\u2019s going to happen we\u2019re going\nto need something.\u201d\nThe Union is often criticised for poor\ncommunication. So should the student\nbody have been consulted about Southside\nBar and perhaps other issues too? Arif is\nnot convinced. He argues that in fact,\n\u201cthis year we\u2019ve engaged in the Union\u2019s\nbiggest consultative exercise in my entire\ntime as a student \u2013 the strategic review\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting paradox with consultation,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cWhen\nyou consult people, they always demand\nmore consultation, and they may not necessarily have done that if they had been\nignorant because you hadn\u2019t consulted\nthem at all.\u201d\nI argue that if the issue had been put to\na referendum, an overwhelming majority would have voted in favour of moving\nSouthside Bar into the communal space\nin Linstead. Arif accepts that, but points\nout that one of the problems with democracy is \u201cthe tyranny of the majority\u201d.\n\u201cMy job is to represent the interests of\nall the students,\u201d he stresses, \u201cand I can\u2019t\nallow Linstead students to be screwed\nover just for a bar \u2013 a bar that wouldn\u2019t\nhave been that big, it would have been\nnon-smoking and it wouldn\u2019t have had the\nmassive real ale collection.\u201d\nConfidence and accountability\nThe President is critical of those who\nbrought motions against him to the Union\nCouncil. \u201cSome people got a bit overex-cited, and in one or two cases that\u2019s a\nbit disappointing because they should\nhave known better due to their previous\ninvolvement in the Union. They could\nhave asked for clarification rather than\nwriting motions to Council.\u201d\nBut he admits: \u201cI\u2019m human and all\nhumans make mistakes. University is a\nlearning experience for everyone; student politics is a learning experience for\nall involved.\u201d\nAttendance at Union events\nI bring up the low level of attendance\nat Union events \u2013 in particular the\nWednesday and Friday late nights \u2013 compared to other London colleges. Arif\nclaims that he is either \u201cthe best or the\nworst person to ask, because I had never\nbeen to one until I was president\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to do with our student demographic,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have a very science\nand engineering centred student base.\nWe have a very male student base, and\nI think many students prefer to go out\nwhere they meet a more rounded set of\nstudents. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ever going to\nget around that.\u201d\nHe sees little point in trying to compete with local clubs and other students\u2019\nunions. \u201cI think it\u2019s more realistic to\nrecognise what our limitations are and\nprovide services when the building is\nredeveloped. We\u2019re not a campus univer-sity, we are in the middle of London. We\ncan\u2019t provide everything so we should\nprovide what the rest of the city doesn\u2019t\nprovide and we should provide a community focal point.\u201d\nThe future\nThe President believes that Imperial\nCollege needs to be more positive and\nambitious in its outlook. \u201cThe College\nneeds to stop holding back on the Bologna\nprocess of standardising degrees across\nEurope,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to get out of\nthe mindset of competing with the Russell\nGroup of [British] universities and into\nthe mindset of competing with the likes of\nHarvard and MIT and Princeton.\u201d\nHe thinks the Union must develop\nits facilities to meet the rising expectations that will come from rising fees. He\nalso suggests \u201csomething like in the US,\nwhere part of the Union\u2019s funding comes\nfrom a compulsory addition to student\nfees,\u201d though he accepts that \u201cit\u2019s not an\noption at the moment because of the current fee arrangements.\n\u201cWe would have to consider whether\npeople could opt out of paying that fee\nand joining the Union, but more importantly it would mean that when you vote,\nyou\u2019re voting for a membership fee.\u201d\nAchievements and regrets\nArif believes his greatest achievement\nwas \u201cgoing from a situation where we\u2019ve\nbeen endlessly sitting around discussing things to a situation where we\u2019re\ntaking the best steps of taking the union\nforward.\n\u201cThe evidence of that is in the successful adoption by Council of a strategic plan;\nthe creation of the Graduate Students\nAssociation; and the massive increase\nin turnout as a result of electronic vot-ing, despite all the criticism, mostly from\nthe authors of the accountability motion,\nabout rushing change through. We can\u2019t\nlet bureaucracy get in the way of what is\nthe right thing to do.\u201d\nAnd his biggest mistake? \u201cI didn\u2019t take\nholiday between the end of my degree\nand the start of my tenure as President\nbecause I have worked every holiday\nsince the age of 16 in paid employment,\nwhich in hindsight I regret \u2013 I probably\nshould\u2019ve done some travelling. So last\nyear I was burnt out and this year I\u2019m\nstill burn\u2019t out. I know I haven\u2019t personally\nperformed as well as I\u2019m physically capable of doing over the past two years.\u201d\nAfterwards, Arif tells me he will consider taking a postgraduate course at\nCambridge or return to the IT world. But\nfirst: \u201cBasically I need a two to three week\nbreak to physically get back together.\u201d\nTHE FELIX INTERVIEW felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cEven with the best will in the world you often can\u2019t do what you set out to achieve\u201d \u2013 Mustafa Arif (right), President of Imperial College Union, with Dave Edwards\n\u201cThe fees battle was lost\nin 1997 by the NUS... who\nfor their own political\nreasons supported the\nGovernment\u201d\n\u201cI do think we need to\nget the Southside Bar\nissue into perspective.\nThis isn\u2019t a long term\nproblem\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m human and all\nhumans make mistakes.\nStudent politics is a\nlearning experience for\nall involved\u201d\n\u00a9\nScience\nMuseum\nDesign\nStudio\n21 june 2005\nfrom 10am to midnight\nwww.exhibitionroadmusicday\n.org\nLondon's home of F\u00eate de la Musique\nWhat\u2019s on at Imperial?\nImperial is thrilled to be participating in the \ufb01rst\nExhibition Road Music Day.

    "content": "LIVE REVIEWS\nSystem Of A Down were one of the\nstronger acts that emerged during\nthe turn of the century nu-metal\ncraze, although they don\u2019t really\ndeserve having that moniker round\ntheir necks. Their latest album,\nMezmerize, shows if anything that\nthey haven\u2019t lost any of that originality or energy in their record-ings, though of course the biggest\nquestion I had when I turned up\nin Brixton was whether this still\ntranslated into the ability to pull off\na great live show.\nLook away now, because the short\nanswer is yes! An honourable mention must go beforehand to their gig-mates Eighties Matchbox B-Line\nDisaster. Having only listened to\nthem occasionally on the radio, I\nwasn\u2019t sure if they would be playing\nany better than the current wave of\nretro indie plaguing the airwaves. In\nfact they rocked. L-O-U-D. Nothing\ncompared to electro-grindcore, but\nnot really for the faint of heart either.\nIt would\u2019ve been nice if there was\nslightly less feedback in their half-hour slot, as they actually weren\u2019t a\nbad opener for a group like System,\nwhich is never an easy thing.\nWhen the world\u2019s best (and probably only) Armenian-folk-metalfusion act walked on an hour later,\nmore or less on time, they began\nwith the first three songs off their\nlatest effort, including the new single B.Y.O.B. This stands for Bring\nYour Own Bombs, apparently, which\nproves that they haven\u2019t lost that\ntopical edge. Of course, attacking\nthe Bush administration has been\na popular pastime for the past five\nyears, but for a band whose previous\nsongs have dealt with such issues\nas drug rehabilitation programs and\nrecognition of the Armenian geno-cide, they have a political agenda\nthat is actually far more mature\nthan that of the band-wagon jumping celebrities who have been all too\nvisible in the news of recent weeks.\nCutting to the chase, these three\nsongs actually did little to stir up\nemotions of the audience. It didn\u2019t\nhelp that bassist Shavo was the\nonly band member who was moving around at this point, somewhat\ndamping the onstage lunacy they\u2019re\nrenowned for. I wasn\u2019t thinking the\nband would go on to play for a further ninety minutes, but then this\nwas System Of A Down live, where\nthe unexpected really is expected.\nAnd every one of those minutes\nwas worth it! The point at which it\nbecame obvious that Needles was\nbeing played, the show shifted up a\nfew gears and everyone was treated\nto a truly awesome experience.\nOf the 25 or so songs played,\nthe biggest share was taken from\nToxicity, with the boys getting a few\nfrom their self-titled as well, which\nwas nice to see. Adding a couple of\nobscure covers and maybe a song or\ntwo off the next album Hypnotize,\ndue in the Autumn, their talents\nweren\u2019t wasted purely on the new\nalbum, even though in hindsight it\nwould\u2019ve been nice to see a couple\nmore of the new songs. Either way,\nit was an entertaining night for all\nconcerned, and proof that System\nare a band marching on and continuing to draw hordes of support for\ntheir own flavour of WTF-inducing\nrock music. Alex McKitrick\nWith a series of cancellations, intermittent releases and band instability episodes to their good name,\nthe actual appearance of Queen\nAdreena after three very average\nsupport bands kept the punters rapt\nfrom the word go. Famous for their\nlegendary live shows, performed by\nan alternately drunk or high Katie\nJane Garside, Queen Adreena\u2019s act\njuxtaposed ethereal art rock with a\ncar crash, with Katie Jane\u2019s impression of a more approachable Kate\nBush on crack providing endless\nmind-bending entertainment for the\ncrowds that amassed.\nSympathy for the poster-girl for\nanorexia and her ridiculous gingham loincloth aside, the band\nworked their way through a very\nshort, albeit tight set, comprising\nof highlights from Taxidermy and\nDrink Me. Very few songs from the\nrecently released Butcher And The\nButterfly release were previewed,\nthose that were played melding\nseamlessly into the fore. The audience were taken into a world of\ndemons and daisies, whilst being\nspat at by every howl, rasp and yelp\nemitted by one of the most spellbinding performers ever to walk the\nLondon stage. Being taken into the\nvoid by a stage-diving work of art is\none thing; being taken that bit deeper by someone wearing everyone\u2019s\nheart on their sleeve is absolutely\ncompelling. Kitty Collar, Pretty\nPolly and Pretty Like Drugs are all\ngreat songs, but losing yourself in\nthe midst of such an expressive performance is another experience.\nQueen Adreena are competent and\npassionate, but not quite as furious\nas I had come to expect from their\nrecords. Highly recommended.\nSajini Wijetilleka\nSelling out the Astoria within a matter of hours is the way forward when\nit comes to ensuring that your gig\ngoes down a treat. (See NIN and\nthe wonderful Avenged Sevenfold for\nfurther reference.)\nIt means your fans are fanatical.\nWhether they\u2019re less discerning is a\ndifferent matter, this variable being\nheavily hormone-dependent in the\ncase of bands with evident aesthetic\nappeal.\nCase in point? Rooster. Supported\nably by the Weezer-lite Famous Last\nWords, the band took to the stage\nwith visibly little fervour for a homecoming gig. The three instrumentalists stood comparatively still, with\nonly Luke on lead guitar providing\nadequate foil to the nimbly-hipped\nNick Atkinson. The songs melded\nseamingly into the midst of screaming and swooning, the bulk of them\nbeing taken from the band\u2019s eponymous debut album. Two new songs,\nHome and Standing In Line, stand\nout from the almost predictable set\nfrom a band so capable of doing\nso much better. Luke\u2019s improvisation on Free\u2019s Alright Now and the\ninstrument swapping on Angels\nwere substantial evidence that the\nonly way is up.\nWith solid pop-rock stompers being\nbelted out in quick succession, a little more variation and a couple more\ncovers wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss.\nThe band appear to have reached a\ncomfort zone where the onus is left\nto Atkinson to make the show.\nBoy, he tries. Swaggering, pos-turing, posing \u2013 this guy can sing,\ndance, look hot and move! But the\nennui sets in so it\u2019s a tired man leading the two-single encore, lightening\nup during the rousing renditions of\nYou\u2019re So Right For Me and Come\nGet Some. Pleasing as these tunes\nare, the observer comes away feeling the set-up is a little contrived,\nwhere Nick taking to the stage to\nrecite the intricacies of his bowel\nhabit would have garnered the same\neffect.\nUltimately, unsatisfying.\nSajini Wijetilleka\nLive and amplified\nQueen Adreena make a rare live appearance, System Of A Down bring their insane live\nshow (and beards) to London, and Rooster fail to impress\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 16 June 2005\n22\nSystem Of A Down\nBrixton Academy\nHHHHI\nQueen Adreena\nIslington Academy\nHHHHI\nRooster\nThe Astoria\nHHIII\nThis is the end; the end, my friend, the end\nSo, the academic year is over. You\u2019re\nall finishing your projects, presenting presentations or killing your neurons with excessive alcohol intake.\nI think most of you will agree that\nthis year has been a great one for\nFelix. We\u2019ve seen a huge expansion in the content of the sections,\nand the move to newspaper format\nhas made the paper look way more\nprofessional and given you more\nwords to skip over while you look for\nthe crossword. I think most of the\ncredit for this should go to Mr David\nEdwards, who has worked many late\nhours and sweated buckets of, well,\nsweat over printing, layouts, editing\nmy badly written prose, and actually\nmaking Felix make money.\nOn a personal note I\u2019d like to thank\nDave for putting up with my inability\nto understand the concept of dead-lines, promising six pages of high\nquality features and delivering two\nand half sides of spelling mistakes\nand factual errors (sorry to those\nwriters whose work I inadvertadly\ncredited to myself, you know who\nyou are because I don\u2019t). I hope the\nincoming editor, Mr Rupert Neate\n(he of fourth-floor library guy insulting fame), can continue with the\nhigh standards Dave has set.\nI\u2019d like to sound off with a quick\nrundown of my personal favourites from this year. First up, taking the award for best new band,\nThe Arcade Fire. I know the backlash has begun, but despite all that\nFuneral is a superb record, and\ntheir live show is one of the best I\u2019ve\never seen. Stars take the award for\nbest pop album \u2013 Set Yourself On\nFire is a bittersweet classic. In hip-hop, Busdriver\u2019s A Fear Of A Black\nTangent was astonishing; honorary\nmention goes to 13&God for making\nmy Notwist/Themselves collaboration fantasy come true. Folkwise,\nHarris Newman\u2019s Accidents With\nNature And Each Other was in my\nears for weeks. The guilty pleasure award goes to Architecture In\nHelsinki for In Case We Die, proving\ntweeness doesn\u2019t make you bad. I\ncould list some more, but these are\nthe ones that really stuck out.\nHave a good summer, kids, and\ndon\u2019t touch those mushrooms, no\nmatter what NME says.\nANDREW SYKES\nMUSIC EDITOR\nQueen Adreena: not averse to a bit of mild nudity\nSOAD: were these the Armenian metalheads you saw, madam?\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

We\u2019ve had plenty of teams enter this year, all of which we\u2019re sure are eagerly awaiting the final table. So here it is...\n1st 2nd 3rd\nHere are our winners, the all-conquering Araldite Sniffers,\na team so efficient they make\nGermans look lazy. Armed with\ncalculators, dandruff and Google,\nfor these guys no challenge is too\nhard, no subject too obscure and\nno anti-perspirant, ever.

Losers.\nThat said, any team whose collective\nDVD collection includes Mr Nanny,\nBeverley Hills Ninja and Flubber will\nalways be welcome here.\nAs the third placed team, these\nguys win a fantastic electric\nshock lie detector machine. No\nlonger will arguments descent into\nshenanigans at their house. They\nalso get The Very Best of David\nHasselhoff.\nFirst thing\u2019s first, thank you to all\nthe teams who entered the FUCWIT\ncompetition, you\u2019re superstars, one\nand all. Even the rubbish teams\ntoo.\nHonourable mentions go to any\nteams who decided to clog our inbox\nwith random Hoff-themed crap.\nThough slightly disturbing, it\u2019s all\ngood.\nAlso, if you\u2019re wondering what happened to Coffee Break these past\ntwo weeks, the Hoff, like so many of\nyou, had coursework to hand in.\nBefore we get on with the very\nimportant issue of prizes, here are\nthe answers to issues 1323 and\n1324.\nIssue 1323 answers\nHoff\u2019s Long Weekend\n(Thanks to The House Of Earthly\nDelights)\nThe Hoff kicked off his weekend by\ndesperately trying to convert a few\ncomputer geeks to the lost cause of\nthe psychotic penguin (aka Linux).\nWhat better place to start than at\na world-renowned, research-led\nscientific institution like Imperial?\nThe dearth of the fair sex, however,\nspelt disaster for his commendable\nplans...\nBreathless, he got on a conventional plane (his beloved Concorde\nhaving recently been \u2018retired\u2019) and\nmade it across the pond with a two-week pregnant 21 year-old acquaint-ance. He somehow found his way\nto Texas, where the local abortion\nclinic had oft proven its use to this\nmost fertile of males. Unfortunately,\na lack of money didn\u2019t allow him to\nproceed as planned...\nNext stop, Miami, and, in a\nrare departure from his blonde-American-dream style bimbos, the\nHoff this time decided to see how\nfar his charms would get him in\nattempting to seduce a nice look-ing, Cuba-exiled young girl (he must\nhave heard the rumours entwining thick Cuban cigars, slim, underage female thighs and something\nelse I\u2019m forgetting at the moment);\nunfortunately, a distinct lack of alcohol (along with them seducing pills)\nand an overtly jealous uncle meant\nhe had to swim all the 140km to\nCuba, board a military helicopter at\nthe Guantanamo Bay Army Base,\nand hastily make his way across half\nthe globe to...\nThe New Model Republic of Iraq!\nHoping to play his part in spreading\nfreedom (not to mention his superior genes) to this part of the world, he\naligned himself with the American\nauthorities in bringing about Iraqi\nFreedom. The GI rush to secure\nan autograph from The Man, how-ever, spelt disaster for the efforts\nunderway (which was interpreted\nin the rest of the world as a lack of\nplan). Thus, the only nuclear power\nin the region had yet to be made\nto feel comprehensively safe and\nsecure...\nReal Men\n1. Rick Moranis, legendary star\nof Scarface, Citizen Kane and\nAnchorman, also played Wayne\nSzalinski in the hard-hitting fact-based drama Honey, I Shrunk The\nKids.\n2. Chuck Norris, while he\u2019s not busy\nkilling foreigners, blowing up foreigners or shagging attractive for-eigners, likes to take time out to do\na little bit of acting. As well as cropping up in Dodgeball he also plays a\ntransvestite hooker in the feel-good\nhit of 1991, Walker, Texas Ranger.\n3. Robocop is Alex Murphy, not Peter\nWeller. Peter Weller is a fucking\nactor, Robocop is the shit. That said,\nmy only memories of the film are of\nhim eating baby food.\n4. The Chuckle Brothers, who are\nbrothers as their name suggests,\nnot father and son like some idiots\nwould have you beleive, originate\nfrom lovely Rotherham. You can\ncatch them almost every day on\nCBBC. Laughter is the best mnedi-cine, and there is no better hangover cure than watching Paul and\nBarry trying to carry a grand piano\nup some stairs. It\u2019s comedy genius.\n5. Hulk Hogan has been in several\nfilms, but the most well known are\nMr Nanny, Suburban Commando\nand my personal favourite, Three\nNinjas: High Noon at Mega\nMountain, an emotive tale of one\nnarcoleptic fighter pilot\u2019s mission\nfor equality.\n6. Homer\u2019s middle name is Jay.\nDuh.\n7. The A-Team are great, and always\nwill be. As well as being Grade A\nSoldiers of Fortune, their ability to\ncreate cars, jet planes and rockets\nfrom the contents of a simple locked\nbarn is a talent we can all envy. Face\nwas the missing guy.\nIssue 1324 answers\nSix Degrees of Whoever\nIt\u2019s a bit long to go through this in\ndetail, so here are our answers:\nDodgeball, Jeff Goldblum,\nIndependence Day, Chevy Chase.\nMel Brooks, Gene Wilder,\nEverything You Always Wanted To\nKnow About Sex (But Were Afraid\nTo Ask), Annie Hall, Diane Keaton.\nWithnail & I, Alien 3, Bill Murray,\nKingpin, Woody Harrelson.\nComing to America, James Earl\nJones, Harrison Ford, William H\nMacy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman,\nBoogie Nights.\nKiefer \u2018I\u2019m a federal agent, and\nI will kill you\u2019 Sutherland, Phone\nBooth, Alexander, Angelina Jolie,\nNicholas Cage, Face/Off.\nBattle Royale, Chiaki Kuriyama,\nKill Bill, Steve Buscemi, The Big\nLebowski, John Goodman.\nHair of the Gods\n1. Samuel L Jackson\u2019s delightful\nJerry Curl wig from Pulp Fiction.\n2. It\u2019s George Michael from his\nWham! heyday. Remember kids,\nchoose life.\n3. It\u2019s Dusty Hill from ZZ Top. Nice\nBeard.\n4. It\u2019s the People\u2019s Princess, Lady\nDi.\n5. The Godfather of Soul, and a living\nlegend, Mr James Brown.\n6. Bloody Beckham innit.\n7. It\u2019s not Elvis like some thought,\ninstead it\u2019s famous weirdo emo-boy,\nMorrissey.\nPrizes!\nHuge thanks to all our teams, you\u2019ve\nearnt some great prizes. The top\nthree have all won copies of The\nVery Best Of David Hasselhoff and\nsome cool stuff besides (see above).\nThe rest of you have a choice of\na four-pack of lovely bottled lager,\nsome non-alcoholic equivalent, or\na copy of The Very Best Of David\nHasselhoff. I know what I\u2019d pick.\nIf you\u2019re intrested in writing for\nCoffee Break next year, email the\neditor at felix@ic.ac.uk.\nSo thank you all for reading and\nhave a great summer, as next year\nis going to be yet another bad one at\nImperial. The Hoff may or may not\nbe back, it all depends on whever\nhe\u2019s passed his software enginering\nexam.

Over the next few decades, today\u2019s engineers will make the real changes.\nDan Wilson reports on an event promoting enginnering solutions to aid developing countries\nIt is estimated that more\nthan 1.1 billion people do not\nhave access to clean drinking water. By heating water\nto 65\u00b0C for five minutes the\nwater becomes pasteurised,\nkilling 99.999% of all harmful\nbacteria \u2013 a simple yet necessary process.\nThe Developing Technologies Department in Mechanical Engineering, headed\nby Ron Dennis, is a registered\ncharity which aims to provide\nengineering solutions to the\ndeveloping world. This year,\na group of third year Imperial\nstudents embarked on developing a water pasteurising\nunit for use in cookstoves in\nrural parts of Nepal as their\n\u2018Design, Make & Test\u2019 project.\nThe project was run in conjunction with a student from\nthe University of Tribhuvan\nin Kathmandu, Nepal.\nBack in December 2004,\nthe project was entered for\nthe Mondialogo Engineering\nAward, an international contest organised by UNESCO\nand DaimlerChrysler. The\naward is an initiative aimed\nat promoting intercultural\ndialogue among young engineers around the world.\nThe initiative calls on students from industrialised\nand developing countries to\nwork together on proposals\nfor sustainable engineering\napplications to aid developing countries.\nAn international jury\nassessed project ideas for\nsustainability, feasibility\nand quality of communication within the project group.\nMore than 1700 engineers\nand students from 79 nations\nregistered for the contest,\nforming 412 international\nteams. From this, 40 finalists were selected in March\nand two Imperial College\nteams were lucky enough to\nbe nominated.\nAs the culmination of the\ncontest, the Mondialogo\nSymposium was held in\nBerlin on 27-30 May, and\ntwo representatives from\nthe water pasteuriser team,\nDan Wilson and Marcus\nRafla, went along for the four\nday event. A total of 65 participants from 28 countries\nattended, making it a truly\ninternational event spanning both the industrialised\nand developing worlds. The\nNepalese student, Sushobhan\nJoshi, made the 4000 mile trip\nand met his team mates face\nto face for the first time .\nNaturally, with Daimler\nChrysler being the owners\nof Mercedes, the teams were\nchauffeured around in their\nfleet of S classes and put up\nin a luxurious hotel \u2013 a welcome change to the London\nUnderground and student\nliving.\nThe Symposium consisted\nof a mixture of sightseeing,\ntours of the DaimlerChrysler\nplant and lots of food and\ndrink to ease the intercultural dialogue. On the last day,\na series of workshops took\nplace in order to exchange\nideas on the contributions of\nengineering to sustainable\ndevelopment and poverty\nreduction, followed by the\nprizegiving ceremony in the\nevening. Held in Mercedes\u2019\nflagship showroom, the ceremony was a lavish event\noverflowing with champagne\nand, of course, nice cars.\nThe tension was high but\nas the winners were called\nto the stage it soon became\napparent that all 21 teams in\nthe attendance had won. All\nteams received a prize fund\nof \u20ac15000 along with the glory\nof being an international\nengineering award winner.\nCongratulations go to the\nentire team for all their hard\nwork: Dan Wilson, Jonathan\nTweed, Caroline Robertson,\nPhilip Wassouf, Marcus\nRafla, John Latham, Alex\nParker, Julian Soon and\nZaina Naboor. The prize\nmoney is going to be used to\nfund an expedition to Nepal\nto carry out further research\nand testing of the pasteuris-ing device.\nDaimlerChrysler has yet to\nannounce if it will support\nanother award next year, but\nif this year is anything to go\nby, it will be a storming suc-cess.\n\u25cf If you would like to\nfind out more or are\ninterested in participating next year, contact\ndan.wilson@ic.ac.uk for\nfurther details\n\u201cThe Imperial water\npasteurisation project\nwas entered for the\nMondialogo\nEngineering Award...\u201d\nA team of Imperial College mechanical engineering students won an award for\ndeveloping a device for pasteurising water in rural Nepal.

According to\nMichael Bond, Opinion Senior\nEditor at New Scientist, the\nanswer appears twofold.\nFirstly, \u201cDalyell is pretty irreplaceable frankly. Because he\nwas Father of the House, he\nhad all the experience and\nincredible access to politi-cians. There was no-one really suitable on that level.\u201d\nBut New Scientist also\nenvisages itself doing something different with the\npages. According to Bond,\nit is not to say that in the\nfuture there won\u2019t be people\nin Westminster writing about\npolitics, but \u201cpolitical coverage will come in different formats rather than just through\none column, for example an\nopinion piece from a politician\nor an analysis.\u201d\nSo Dalyell is an irreplaceable columnist, and it is only\none column after all... but\nthe plot thickens. It seems\n\u2018Westminster Diary\u2019 is not\nthe only political column\nNew Scientist has axed.\n\u2018Washington Diary\u2019, providing the inside story on the\nAmerican political scene\nsince 1994, has also made\na departure. Andreas Frew\n(alias Chris Joyce and Joe\nPalca from the National Public\nRadio science desk) had their\nlast regular spot at the end of\nMay too.\nSo is New Scientist moving away from the politics of\nscience? All we can do now\nis speculate and wait to see.\nPerhaps this just a freak\nNew Scientist blip, or perhaps it will herald the beginnings of a new chapter for the\nmagazine: science minus the\npolitics.\nNew Scientist has dumped its political columns,\n\u2018Westminster Diary\u2019 and \u2018Washington Diary\u2019\nOBLONG PLANET\nPROVES TIME IS\nYELLOW\n(WOW! NOW BUY ME.)\n\n"

    "content": "A recent poll suggested that the\nname Smith is deemed the most\ncommon surname in the world.\nThus we could easily assume that a\ncouple with that surname would be\nas common a couple as you can get.\nAdd some glamour to that and you\nhave two suave, rich, good looking\nand articulate individuals who are\npresented as the ultimate dream\ncouple. Or so it seems.\nFor a start, you wouldn\u2019t want\nthese particular Smiths inviting you\nover for dinner, since Mrs Smith\nkeeps a stash of lethal weapons in\na secret compartment in the oven.\nGetting caught in the crossfire of\ntheir domestic arguments can actually be life threatening.\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star\nas Mr and Mrs Smith, assassins\nleading double lives as a quiet suburban couple married for \u201cfive or\nsix years\u201d. However, their marriage\nseems to be heading for trouble, as\nthey refuse to communicate with one\nanother about their lives. Their visits to the marriage counsellor, which\nappear in snapshots throughout the\nfilm, give us an idea of the lack of\ntrust they have for each other.\nIn a twist of fate, the pair discover that their next targets are each\nother. Thus begins a high octane\nadventure.\nJolie and Pitt carry the film very\nwell. Most of the attention and focus\nare directed on them, and rightly\nso, as their on-screen chemistry\nsizzles. Both are funny and sexy,\nso it is never boring seeing them\nexchange comments and even gun-fire. The movie goes to great length\nto show off the two gorgeous heroes\nin action with a final showdown that\nis so reminiscent of other films of\nthis nature.\nHowever, there does not seem to\nbe any development of the organisations that they work for, and the film\nseemed to end on quite an abrupt\nnote without knowing how these\nmysterious groups might interfere with the couple\u2019s lives again.\nPerhaps it would have been a lot\nmore interesting to see how both\nJohn and Jane Smith execute their\njobs on a daily basis.\nThe support cast did not seem to\nhave a lot of screen time and so the\nviewer might find it hard to get to\nknow the characters.\nIn summary, there wasn\u2019t anything\nunexpected from this film but it was\nstill an entertaining watch. The plot,\nalthough somewhat predictable,\nstill manage to deliver, due to both\nPitt and Jolie being so suited to\ntheir roles.

Scientific genius Reed\nRichards (Ioan Gruffudd) gains the\nability to stretch and manipulate\nhis body and takes the name Mr\nFantastic. Reed\u2019s girlfriend Sue\nStorm (Jessica Alba) is granted the\npower to become invisible and create force fields, aptly naming herself The Invisible Woman. Sue\u2019s hothead brother Johnny (Chris Evans)\nbecomes The Human Torch, able to\ncontrol fire and cover his entire body\nwith roaring flames. Reed\u2019s best\nfriend Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis)\nis transformed into a rock-like crea-ture, gaining incredible strength as\na result and calling himself The\nThing. Together, they use their powers to try and foil the evil plans of Dr\nDoom (Julian McMahon).\nAs a fan of movies in the comic\nbook genre, I have been anticipating\nthe release of Fantastic Four for a\nwhile now and am sure I won\u2019t be\ndisappointed with the results. The\nmovie promises to be eye candy,\nwith the attention to detail being\nphenomenal. The Thing was created\nusing prosthetics rather than CGI\nand achieves a unique look instead\nof the incredibly fake Hulk. A lot of\ntime was also spent on making Mr\nFantastic\u2019s stretching ability seem\nreal and giving it an awesome elastic appearance.\nAs always with this type of\nfilm, it is everybody\u2019s wish that it\nstays true to the comics. Fantastic\nFour promises just that. Both as\na group and individually, the character development and relationships are being kept just how they\nshould be.\nI\u2019m predicting that Fantastic Four\nwill be one of this summer\u2019s big\nfilms.

    "content": "Shell comes clean\nFor the first time in it\u2019s history as a PLC, Royal Dutch/\nShell Group has published\nit\u2019s internal guidelines for\nestimating reserves of oil and\nnatural gas.\nThe guidelines were tightened last year after the company disclosed that it had\nsignificantly overestimated\nits oil reserves. The revised\nrules now meet US regulatory guidelines and help put\nbehind it an accounting scandal that unfolded in early\n2004.\nThe Anglo-Dutch oil company cut its estimate of\nreserves by more than a third\nsince last January and has\nfaced criticism of its accounting practices, such as booking\nreserves on projects before\ninvestment plans had been\napproved.\nUnder its new rules, Shell\nsaid that for a major field of\n50m barrels of oil equivalent\nor more, the final investment\napproval must be received\nbefore a project is booked\nin its reserves. However, for\nsmaller oil fields, Shell must\nalso have evidence that similar projects have come to\nfruition as this would prevent\nunnecessary environmental\ndamage.\nIt said all proven reserves\nmust be monitored at every\nyear end, to make sure\nprior bookings are still valid.\nDocumentation of changes at\nthe reservoir level must be\ncarried out each year.\nThe disclosure comes after\na $150m settlement with both\nthe SEC and the FSA, the\nfinancial regulatory bodies in\nthe US and UK respectively,\nin July, following a string of\nrestatements after the company allegedly boosted its\nnumbers artificially. The payments didn\u2019t imply a recognition of guilt, but the company\nis still the target of related\nclass-action lawsuits in the\nUS.\nIn case one wonders why\nsuch guidelines are so impor-tant, they can have a major\nimpact on the share price of\nstocks, especially when esti-mates, profits and revenues\nare revealed to the world by\na PLC like Shell.\nSpitzer subdued\nNew York Attorney General\nEliot Spitzer last week had\nhis lawsuit defeated as\njurors acquitted the Bank of\nAmerica\u2019s broker, Theodore\nC Sihpol III, of \u2018late trading\u2019.\nLate trading involves the\nexchange of mutual fund\nshares after the close of\ntrade (4pm). Trades posted\nafter that time are supposed\nto receive a price set the following day. But, in a battle\nof wits, Sihpol was acquitted as late trading was never\nconsidered improper before\nhe was being prosecuted and\narrested in September 2004.\nC Evan Stewart, Sihpol\u2019s\nlawyer, praised him for abandoning the traditional settlement with Spitzer and going\nto court to contest his allega-tion. In this case, it paid off.\nSihpol\u2019s success is a fairly\nsignificant achievement, as\nit will encourage other firms\nthat have pending lawsuits\nfiled by Spitzer, whose relentless pursuit of firms operating outside the law has seen\ntheir shares drop by over\n50%.\nRichard Grasso, the former\nhead of the New York Stock\nExchange, has also chosen\nto prepare a defence for trial\ninstead of reaching settlements with the New York\u2019s\nAttorney General. Mr Spitzer\nlast year filed a lawsuit\nagainst Mr Grasso, arguing\nthat his compensation package represented excessive\nremuneration for the head of\na not-for-profit organisation.\nHis case has not yet been\nscheduled.\nThree other executives in\nthe mutual fund industry are\nscheduled to defend charges of permitting improper\nmutual fund trading before\nthe New York Supreme Court\njudge who heard Mr Sihpol\u2019s\ncase.\nFinal words\nIn this past year, we\u2019ve tried\nto bring you news that is relevant and interesting to the\nbusiness-minded students\nof Imperial College. We\u2019ve\ntried to present a fair, true\nand rounded picture of the\nstate of some of the world\u2019s\nbaddest governments, mammoth power-hungry corporations and ugliest billionaires.\nUnfortunately for you, you\u2019re\nin a country run by one of\nthose governments, you\u2019ll\nprobably join one of the mammoth corporations and, like\ncertain Imperial graduates,\nyou might just end up as one\nof the ugly billionaires!\nBusiness business.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 16 June 2005 7\nLatest from the Square Mile\nNumaan Chaudhry brings you the freshest hand-picked business news\n\u201cHow much oil have we really got then?\u201d Adjustments will now be made as to how Shell\u2019s reserved are calculated and presented to the public\n\n"
