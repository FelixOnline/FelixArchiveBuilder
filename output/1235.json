Despite my initial reservations\nabout the film, I was cheered by the presence of Jason\nSchwartzman in the cast list. His performance as Max Fischer\nin the indie hit Rushmore (1998) was fantastic, so I was eager to\nsee what he had followed it up with. As it turns out, I would\nhave been better off watching Rushmore again.\nSlackers finds Schwartzman playing \"Cool\" Ethan, the socially\ninept nerd who is in the process of stalking the angelic Angela\n(James King). His creepy task is eased upon discovering the\ncheating antics of our three eponymous slackers. He proceeds\nto blackmail Dave (Devon Sawa) and his stooges, demanding to\nbe fixed up with Angela, or else he will have them expelled. But\nas is always the way in these things, the charming Dave himself ends up the object of Angela's affections. And so it goes on.\nThe opening scene of the film, where we are inducted into\nscamming world of the boys, is a well-handled juggling act, but\nafter that it falters. There are straight-to-camera monologues,\nbizarre dream sequences and all manner of visual tricks, but\nnone of these distract from the essentially lazy, teen-comedy-by-numbers on show here.\nAs for gross-out, American Pie had its warm apple pie scene,\nRoad Trip its Jack Sprat sex scene, so Slackers has to have its\nhook too. We are actually treated to two, first a karaoke penis\nsock-puppet scene, and then an old woman hooker sponge-bath\nscene. But two sick wrongs don't make a funny right. That is not\nto say I didn't laugh at all. I did. But the good gags are hidden\naway amongst a lengthy array of tiresome fart, dick and jerk-off\njokes. Even Road Trip seems reserved compared to most of this.\nSchwarzman's efforts are hardly subtle, and despite having\nbeen given the majority of the funny material, he never makes\nEthan into anything more than a2d caricature. It would have\nbeen nice to see the makers have the courage to produce something slightly blacker and more original about the obsessive\nstalking thread involving Ethan, but they ultimately shy away\ninto more familiar teen rom-com territory.\nJason Schwartzman\ninterview with a Slacker\nHow was the experience of shaving a large A in your chest\nhair?\nIt was fine! A couple of times the razor got snagged and was\nlike ouch! It was just an idea I had. I was thinking to myself\none night, okay at this point in the movie you know I'm crazy,\nbecause I think the way the character evolves in the first half\nyou aren't sure.\nHow do you view Slackers?\nI think it's a good funny college movie that's a little dirty and\nwill get reactions out of people. It'll make you laugh. I think a lot of the humour is a little dark, but I try not to put too much\nthought into it. I just think you should just go and enjoy it and\nhave a good time. It is pretty nuts. I mean, if you're going to see\nthis movie then you probably like beer so just have a good time.\nHow did you get the role for Slackers?\nI had met the director, Dewey, and I remember him talking\nabout his making a movie. I met with him for about an hour and\nthen I asked him 'should I come back and audition?' and he said\n'you just did.' And I got the part. But the reason I ultimately did\nthe movie was I thought here's an opportunity to flex a different muscle and do for once in my life a big slapstick type of\ncomedy. I thought the character was a good environment to\nexperiment with being physical for me and playing dark.\nSo you didn't do it for the money?\nDo you want to plug your CD for a few minutes?\nMy band is Phantom Planet, we have an EP the album is\nalready out. It's called The Guest.\nIf you had to choose between being a musician or an actor\nwhich would you become?\nI would become a painter.\nWhat does your father do?\nMy dad actually passed away. I was thirteen.\nI'm sorry.\ntoo Adam Joyce\nFelix On Film Slackers Competition Are you a Slacker? More likely you're an uber-geek.

    "content": "reviews music\nINTERVIEW with\nRod Jones from Idlewild\nIdlewild's new single You Held The World In Your Arms is out\nnow, and the album The Remote Part is due for release in July.\nFelix spoke to guitarist Rod Jones over the telephone.\nFELIX: XFM' s DJ Natasha was so en amour ed with your last\nsingle Roseability that she started to compare all other songs\nto it and give them a \"Roseability rating\". Had you heard\nabout this, and how would you rate your new single?\nROD: No, I hadn't heard about that. It would be difficult to try\nand rate You Held The World In Your Arms along those lines, as\nit's quite a different song. We felt at the time of its release that\nRoseability was one of the best things we'd written, but we feel\nthat what we're writing now is better.\nAs you mentioned, You Held The World In Your Arms is quite\ndifferent to your previous songs - is this an indication of what\nthe new album will be like?\nYes, it is. With previous albums, we felt that most of the tracks\nwere more or less just noisy pop songs. So we decided to experiment a bit, and that helped us learn what we were capable of.\nYou toured America to promote 100 Broken Windows. Did you\nenjoy your time out there, and what was the response like\nfrom the American audiences?\nIt was great fun and very exciting, but quite weird because the\nalbum was released about a year later than it was here. So we\ndidn't know what to expect, and when we went out there and\ndid the small club tour we found that we had a small loyal following who had got hold of the album on import. It was a very\nrefreshing experience. We plan to release the new album at the\nsame time in America, because we want to continue improving\nas a band and to have staggered releases means that you're\nalways going back to things you were doing a year earlier, and\nthat can slow your progress.\nWhen you first started to break through into the British mar-ket, you gained a reputation for being very good live. What\ndid you feel were the reasons for that?\nWe gained a reputation for gigging quite a lot, and I suppose all\nthe practice we got helped to make each show better than the\nlast. Also, we felt that the songs on the record weren't as strong\nas they were live because they were basically noisy rock. With\nthe new album, the reverse is true, in that the songs have a lot\nof subtlety to them which is difficult to recreate live. So we have\nhad to really reinvent ourselves as a live act.\nWhat is your take on the charts at the moment, and how do\nyou think your new single will do?\nWe don't really pay much attention to the charts at the moment,\neven though maybe we should. But we know there's a lot\naround that isn't great. I do feel that people get a bit nostalgic\nabout the charts in previous eras, but I'm sure that there was just as much crap around in 1979 or whenever as there is now.\nWe just want to play the music and try and let that do the talk-ing. We are hoping that the strength of the new songs will get\npeople to listen.\nTank\nSingles\nRoundup\nHUNDRED REASONS (pic above) - Silver\nYeah, baby, the Rock Sound-appointed saviours of British rock\nare back. Sounding like a horrible mix of Blink 182 and Incubus\ngone wrong, this single disappoints severely after the excellent\nIf I Could, with its formulaic lyrics and sea shanty rhythm.\nAwful.\nSajini\nTHE ELECTRIC SOFT PARA D EEmpty At The End/ This Given Line\nThe Electric Soft Parade are a bit like Travis, but a lot happier.\nThey use similar subjects for their songs, but tend to be more\nupbeat. They are fairly formulaic, whilst somehow managing to\navoid sounding repetitive. This is the second single from their\ncritically acclaimed debut album Holes In The Wall, and it\nshows a lot of promise.\nTank\nSERAFIN - Serafin EP 1\nBog standard emo, this one. It sometimes sounds a little\ngrungy, like Stone Temple Pilots. Other times, a little Hundred\nReasons. Serafin are probably going to be pretty big, but had\nthey been around two years ago, they wouldn't even have got a record deal. So it goes.\nBen\nMULE SKINNER JONES - Terrible Stories\nMuleskmner Jones is a cult internet eccentric, apparently,\nand I 've no idea WHAT is going on here! Over duelling banjos,\nan argument as to the origin of a bloodstain is played out by the\nparents from Little House On The Prairie in really off-key voices.\nIs this what unemployable actors get up to when they're not on\nshift in Starbucks?\nBen\n\n"

    "content": "club active\nThis was originally sent many\nmoons ago, and I'm sorry that\nit is only going in now. I know\nthat it's not really better late\nthan never at this stage, but\nhere it is anyway... -Ed\nEurope's largest student\nrelay races are the Hyde Park\nRelays, which are organised by\nImperial's cross country club.\nEvery year sees new friends\ncoming to take part for the first\ntime, as well as the return of\nthe regulars. The 54th Relays\ntook place on Saturday 16th February. Due to the\nrenowned quality of the race,\nthe first guests arrived on\nWednesday, and like last year\nthese were the Polish teams.\nAgain we challenged them\nto a game of darts but unfortunately due to the comprehensive manner of our defeat last\nyear, they merely laughed at\nour challenge. The Polish\nfound themselves in our most\nluxurious accommodation,\n(also known as Southside),\nwhich they thoroughly enjoyed\nas it is now part of their pre-race ritual. There were signs\nthat they were starting to take\nthe race seriously as well as\nnot only were they seen training just after their arrival, but\nthey had also brought over a runner in last years World\nAthletics Championships (he\nran 400min45.6). On Thursday it was time for\nthe arrival of the Dutch and\nItalian teams. We had been\nwarned in advance that the\nDutch would be bringing a large team, but were delighted\nwhen we discovered that this\nnumber was 170. The Dutch\nalso brought over their game of\nhops y flopsy, but after the\nactivities of last year it had to\nbe banned due its dangerous\ncontent. Arriving at midnight\nthey were raring to go and\nmany of them decided that\nLondon's night life should be\nHyde Park Relays\nsampled immediately. South\nKensington isn't unfortunately\nquite the 24hr place that some\nhad hoped for, but they found\nTrafalgar Square and enjoyed\nthemselves.\nFriday started with the\nalmighty baggage storage\nevent (rumours suggest that\nRoly and Mike are being head-hunted by BA), as all of the\nbags had to be moved into\nstorage for the day. This could\nhave been a major problem but\nit all went fine and so we could\nrelax. Friday night was Valentine's night at the union,\nand the place was packed.\nCurrent IC students tended to\nfind that, 'I don't recognise\nanyone here', as lot of our\nguests decided to join the\nparty, however this meant that\nthere were females in the\nunion. Also on Friday we saw\nthe arrival of the German and\nSpanish teams, but to our huge\ndisappointment the girls from\nStirling didn't make it. We also\nsaw that the Irish didn't make\nthe trip across, though this\ncould be due to their sexual\nexploits being broken up last\nyear.\nOn the day of the race, our\nguests found themselves\nbeing woken up at 7am again\n(unfair advantage?!), as our\nLeader (aka Demetrious)\ndecided that things still needed to be done before the race\ncould begin. After breakfast\n(who had some?) we split up\nand started to organise things.\nThe course needed to be setup and this saw the return of\nWestminster's captain Mike\nBoucher. A slight problem\narose as it was discovered that\nthe map showing the course\nwas inaccurate, but former\nLondon marathon winner\nHugh Jones appeared and\nbeing our saviour, managed to\nre-measure the course before it\nwas too late, enabling accurate results.\nWhilst some members were\nbusy with this, others were\nregistering the teams, distributing numbers and selling t shirts. Soon the first aid ers began to arrive, with the mar-s hal's and timekeepers\nappearing at the bandstand,\nso we knew the race would\nsoon begin. The official starter\nof the race was the legendary\ncoach Frank Horwill. After he\nwas found (drinking in the\nunion) we moved him over to\nthe start and the race began.\nThe men were rur in ing six legs\nof 5150m, whilst the women\nwere doing 3 legs of 3350m.A good field had entered both\nraces with the notable exception of Loughborough.\nHowever after challenging us\nto a drinking race at BUSA, 2\nweeks earlier, we didn't think\nthat they would show their\nfaces.\nTo ensure that the leaders of\nthe races didn't get lost on the\nglorious day we employed the\nuse of two cyclists Roly, and\nGeordie Boy who cycled in front of the front runners so\nthat they knew where they\nwere going. IC got off to a fantastic start with Francois running what ultimately proved to\nbe the sixth fastest time of the\nday. After this we found that\nin the men's teams there was a split between those racing and\nthose who wanted to enjoy the\nexperience for as long as pos-sib le. Imperial's A team in the\nmen's race finished 5th from\nthe student teams out of over\n70 finishers. What made the\nday even better was the fact\nthat our A,B and C teams finished 1st,2 nd and 3rd out of\nevery student team from the\nUniversity of London that\nentered. Our women keen to\ntake some glory for them-selves, and also performed\nwith distinction being the first\ncollege from the University of\nLondon to finish.\nFollowing the run was the\ntea and presentation ce remo ny. Dan once again excelled\nhimself and along with help\nfrom other members of the club\nmanaged to give away (eat?)\nall of the food and drink. The\nwinners of the prizes included\nthe Outdoor Activities club,\nwho defended their title of\nbest internal team convincingly and also the teams from\nBativieren who collected 2\nwooden spoons.\nThe after race party was held in the union again this\nyear, but with the presence of\na barbecue outside from 10.\nThe DJ this year was our very\nown Mike Wilcox (can take\nbookings for weddings, bar-mitzvah s, wakes...) who excelled everyone's expectations by actually playing good\nmusic in Db's( a first?).\nUnfortunately though, the\ndrinking games didn't go\nentirely to plan, as the organisation fell apart (rigging the\ndraw to face the eventual winners in the first round) and so\nwe were unable to defend our\ntitle, though a special thanks\nneeds to go out to John who saved the day by joining the\nteam at the last minute (where\nwas Grant?). The night ended\nwith Daisy Boy taking a special interest in a Polish girl\n(\"I 've given my sleeping bag\naway, what can I do now?\").\nSunday began with dreary\nheads rising as our guests\nbegan to leave, and we could\ncontemplate returning to our\nbeds. We would like to thank\neveryone for all their help in the event, and hope that next\nyears' event can rise to the\ntough challenge of being as\ngood as this one.\nPS If anyone has any good\nideas of what to do with 200 t shirts please get in touch!\n\n"

It is a chance for everyone to find out about the\nvarious Union activities this year. It will\nalso be a chance to ask the officers of the\nUnion about their work this year. The\nmain feature will be the elections for\nUnion officers for next year. The nomination papers are on the President's board\n(level one of the Union Building). You can\nemail me for more information.\nDegree Awarding Powers\nAs some of you are aware the College has\napplied for reserve degree awarding pow-ers. Currently the College awards\nUniversity of London degrees but the\nCollege would like to award its own degrees under the Imperial College name.\nThis will also allow greater control over\nour degree programmes and be an important part in the strategy towards increasing the global brand of Imperial College.\nIt is fully expected that we will be awarded these powers later this year.\nSummer Ball\nMany of you would have seen the bright\npink posters for the Summer Ball. The\nevent will be taking place on Saturday 8th June. Currently the acts include\nCornerShop, James Taylor Quartet,\nScratch Perverts and Artful Dodger.\nAdded to that the event will feature fairground rides, games stalls, cocktail bars\nand more. It promises to be bigger and\nbetter than ever before. Tickets can be\nobtained from the Union Reception.\nCharing Cross\nThis week also saw the official opening of\nthe new student facility at Charing Cross.\nThis project is the biggest since the\ndevelopment of the Beit Basements and is\nlocated in the Reynolds building. This\nnew facility features a brand new bar,\ncafeteria, BOP area complete with DJ booth, stage and lighting. The new facility also features a brand new gym in the\nbasements. The project greatly improves\nstudent facilitates on the Charing Cross\nCampus and is open to all students. Keep\nan eye out for publicity on the events taking place there this term.\nBeit Quad\nThe Beit Quad will undergo a facelift over\nthe coming weeks. The project will see\nnew lawns and paths laid with improved\nfacilities in the quad. There will also be\nnew bike racks for students to use. The\nUnion will be open for business as usual.\nLost the Union?\nApologies to all those who have been\nconfused by the location of the Union\nreception and the Student Activities\nCentre. This has in part been due to the\nnecessary heating works in the building.\nJust to clarify the new permanent home\nof the Students Activities Centre (formal-ly known as the Resource Centre) is in the\nEast Wing of the Beit Basements. The\nUnion reception will be located on the\nfirst floor (access via the East staircase)\nand will move back to its normal position\nnext week.\nSen Ganesh, President\nDoUu\n~*iH tunes II\nfl hoi miK of\nfavourite/ 2 done e2 Every Friday\ndB/ Bar open/ al 8\nBarbeque from 10\nFriday Night Out\ng Supported by\nv1111 imperial\n\u2022 college\nAte\n\u2022VI 9/\u00a3 I.50/ E2 gue/tr after\neA Yv\ndays CK wee/v'1 for s H<K/ nt n*r S m'i4U \u2022\u00a9\u2022 or imperial\n' college\nTU Reynolds fiu i/d. ij ll rtl cur i/i* Cross Campus union\nS4.D \u00bbis4* n%s Road W6 CHARING CROSS BAR\n\n"

    "content": "IC Radio\nfelix talk\nObjectivity\nWe at Felix thought it might be refreshing to\nhave some IC Radio banter (it's the official\nterm, you know) from someone without a membership. I appreciate that the kind of\nself-praise or wilful un conventionality, either way designed to make you think the\nauthors are Cool, that you see here each\nweek is not always easy to believe.\nSo here we are; an objective opinion from\na non-member of IC Radio. If anything, I'm slightly biased against them, as I must\nshare a basement with them. If the stench\nof rotting Chinese take away in the Felix\noffice doesn't get me, Photo-soc haven't kidnapped me for a modelling shoot (guffaw)\nor a dalek escaped from the Sci-Fi library\nfails to \"exterminate\" me, then the quake-inducing reverberations from the IC Radio\nstudio may occasionally begin to grate.\nDeprecation\nWhat can a bunch of students do, anyway?\nA surprising amount actually, like spot that\nit's bad literary style to ask rhetorical questions in newspaper articles. They can also\nmake good radio. Those with a technical\ndisposition are in their element producing\nshows, installing and fixing equipment, and\nplaying with panels whose sole purpose is\nto blink periodically whilst yelling \"phase\nlock that transducer into the primary ret i cul ation port\" and \"she can na take much\nmore o' this captain\" - or was that IC Sci-Fi\nSociety?\nMeanwhile, the arty types - you know,\nthey wear patchwork trousers and sun-hats\n- are charismatic, musical or just \"zany\"\nover the air-waves. If you're not averse to an\neyeful, then try the webcam too.\nTop ten achievements of IC Radio\nTen: Letting me write this article. Nine:\nTheir award-wir r ning website and web-casts. Eight: Their celebrity jingle line-up.\nSeven: Adopting \"fisting\" as a punishment.\nSix: Allowing Will and I to present a truly\ndaft hour-long show when we're tired and\npanicking. Five: Actually archiving that\nshow! Four: Renaming 'George' to Jerry' so\nthat their show could infringe ice cream\nmanufacturers' trademarks. Three: Giving\nme a colour logo to print in black-and-white\nevery week. Two: Thinking that having a show presented by two naked men would\nimprove listening figures. One: Naming\ntheir waste paper bin \"Lucy,\" inspired ly after the name embossed on its lid.\nWhat I was meant to say\nWhen Steve, the current IC Radio Station\nManager - amusingly abbreviated SM, yes\nit is funny, it is - breathlessly asked me to\nwrite the IC Radio column before he tore\nhead-long into a pile of books like a panic-stricken and highly literate squirrel, he\nasked me to write something that would\nencourage people to listen to IC Radio and\nsay how great they were.\nWell, maybe I haven't been entirely honest so far - they are a pretty good bunch. I even went to their AGM with the express\nintention of skewing the election counts by\nraising my unwashed non-member hand\noccasionally whilst drinking beer, but even\nthat didn't make them hurt me.\nSo, to sum up IC Radio, if you can't join\n'em, listen to 'em - 999AM or at the address\nhinted at below. AW\nic radio www.ic radio. com\nChaplaincy: Stress is...\nStress is the 'wear and tear' our bodies\nexperience as we adjust to our continually\nchanging environment; it has physical and\nemotional effects on us and can create positive or negative feelings. As a positive\ninfluence, stress can help compel us to\naction; it can result in a new awareness and\nan exciting new perspective. As a negative\ninfluence, it can result in feelings of distrust,\nrejection, anger, and depression, which in\nturn can lead to health problems such as\nheadaches, upset stomach, rashes, in som nia, ulcers, high blood pressure, heart dis-ease, and stroke. Stress will help or hinder\nus depending on how we react to it.\n75% of the general population experiences at least 'some stress' every two\nweeks (National Health Interview Survey).\nPositive stress adds anticipation and\nexcitement to life, and we all thrive under a certain amount of stress. Deadlines, competitions, confrontations, and even our frustrations and sorrows add depth and enrichment to our lives. We need to learn how to\nmanage stress rather than eliminate it.\nInsufficient stress acts as a depressant and\nmay leave us feeling bored or dejected; on\nthe other hand, excessive stress may leave\nus feeling tied up in knots. Identifying unrelieved stress and being aware of its effect\non our lives is not sufficient for reducing its\nharmful effects. Just as there are many\nsources of stress, there are many possibilities for its management.\nBecome aware of stress and emotional\nand physical reactions. Dorit ignore it or\ngloss over your problems.\nRecognise what you can change. Can you\nchange your stress or s, if they're not exams,\nby avoiding or eliminating them? Can you\nshorten your exposure to stress?\nReduce the intensity of your emotional\nreactions to stress. Are you viewing your\nstress or s in exaggerated terms and/or taking a difficult situation and making it a dis-aster? Are you expecting to please every-one? Are you overreacting? Put the situation in perspective. Do not labour on the\nnegative aspects and the 'what if's. Learn to moderate your physical reactions to stress. Slow, deep breathing and\nrelaxation can help in reducing stress, as\ncan taking exercise and a healthy diet.\nMaintain your emotional reserves.\nDevelop some mutually supportive friend-ships. Pursue realistic goals, which are\nm earring ful to you, rather than goals others\nhave for you that you do not share.\nExpect some frustrations, failures, and\nsorrows. Always be kind and gentle with\nyourself.\nIf you are experiencing stress you are not\nalone. There are people at Imperial who can\nhelp. The Health Centre (49375/6), Student\nCounsellors (49430), The Chaplaincy\n(49600) or your Tutor.\n\n"

(Page 8)\n'Airport Lounge' Takes Off\nThe new bar on the Charing Cross\nHospital campus was officially opened\nlast Tuesday, a week after it had come\ninto active operation.\nSituated in the Reynolds Building on St.\nDunstans Street, this new bar is the\nresult of the refurbishment of what was( somewhat) affectionately known to\nolder students as the 'Airport Lounge'.\nThe total cost of the project was around\n1.5 million pounds, and on entering the\nbar it is easy to see where this money has\ngone.\nIn addition to the fully licensed bar,\nthere is a 'snack' shop with fixed seating\narea, and a dance area which contains\nsofas and chairs by day, which are\ncleared away to form a dance floor by\nnight. Needless to say there is a huge\nsound system and a video projection\nscreen to accommodate the entertainment of a standard night out.\nThe project was initially started by\nLome McEwan, President of the Medics'\nStudent Union last year, his original\nintention being to refurbish St. Mary's The New Bar at Charing Cross\nBar in Paddington. However, when it\nbecame clear that this was not going to\nbe possible for space reasons, he turned\nhis attention to other campi, with this\nfinal result.\nDespite original problems getting funding from the Union, Mr. McEwan eventually managed to find independent funding from three sources: the Faculty of\nMedicine itself, Hammersmith Special\nTrustees, and College itself. He also has\nthe fortune to be one of the few students\nwho has ever seen a project completed\nduring their time here, with the total\nundertaking completed in less than two\nyears.\nAnother unusual aspect of the bar is\nthe license, the hours of which have been\nextended by special permission after a deal was struck with the West London\nMagistrates Court. Having heard that\nmedic students work very antisocial\nhours, the magistrates agreed that the\nStudents' Union would not have to apply\nfor late licenses on Wednesday and Friday nights, but that they should be\ngranted to the Charing Cross Bar as a matter of course.\ncontinued on page 2\n\"Felix can announce that Imperial\nstudents have, over one year, raised\nover one hundred thousand pounds\nica us1111 j m "

With the help of a few\nshort emails and an extremely large cal-cul at or, Felix can announce that Imperial\nstudents have, over one year, raised over\none hundred thousand pounds for various\ngood causes!\nSo many groups and individuals have committed\ntheir time and effort to\nhelping good causes, from\norganising entire charity\nweeks to sponsored runs,\npub crawls, a bse il s, Great\nHall shows, the London\nMarathon and dressing up\nas Pudsey. Some events\nhave raised more than o th ers, but every single penny\nraised means extra cash\nfor charities that desperately need it. Below, in\norder of magnitude but\nwithout numbers (this\ncharity thing isn't an ego\ntrip, right?) the people\nwho have contributed to\nthat incredible charity\ntotal are:\n\u2022 The ICSMSU RAG Week\nteam chaired by medic\nHayley Kirsop raised\nphenomenal amounts for\nCLIC, the 3H Fund and\nParkside Hospital Radio.\n\u2022 Islamic Society's charity appeal supported Islamic Reliefs work in\nAfghanistan.\n\u2022 ICU Rag Week, organised by the ICU\nRAG committee, raised funds to build\nthe first Shooting Star Children's Hospice in West London.\n\u2022 Daniel James & Joanna Wiser ran the\nLondon Marathon for Scope.\n\u2022 Orchestra members collected for Help\nthe Aged at a Royal Albert Hall concert.\n\u2022 LINKS Society's Jenni Wood organised\nsponsored a bse i ling for St John\nAmbulance.\n\u2022 Chemistry post gradE mma Watson\nwas silent for seven days to help BBC\nChildren in Need.\n\u2022 Stupid games on the Queen's Lawn at\nSports Day raised cash for homelessness charity Shelter, thanks to Ruth\nRoberts and crew.\nWye RAG Week, organised by Thomas\nBradshaw for Kent Air Ambulance was\na big success.\nLi Bin and Singapore Society's charity\njog a th on and flag day help mentally\ndisabled children in Singapore through\nthe charity MINDS.\nTom Scorer is still raising cash for\nWhizz Kids, check out the sports pages\nto find out more.\nIndia Soc's incredible \"East Meets\nWest\" helped the international humanitarian medical charity Medicins Sans\nFrontieres.\nUnion welfare officers collected cash\nfor UK AIDS victims in the Imperial\nAIDS Awareness week.\nJohn-Joe Reilly and the Falmouth\nKeogh Hall committee stunned\nSouthside with a show for Rotherham\nHospice.\nHindu Society's charity week events\nsupported charity Sewa International.\nSilwood Park's various fundraising\nshenanigans donated to Prostate\nCancer Research and Guide Dogs for\nthe Blind.\nInspired yet?\nThere's still a chance for individuals out\nthere to raise that total even more - ICU\nRAG are organising parachute jumps to\nraise cash for any charity you want to\nsupport. So if you're feeling dangerous\nemail rag@ic.ac.uk for more details.\nAlso if you're feeling dangerous, the post\nof ICU RAG chair is open to anyone at the\nUnion AGM on Thursday\n'^'f::.16 th March, at 1pm. Your\nmission, should you\nchoose to accept it, is to\nsupport, encourage and\n11 generally let everyone at\nII Imperial know about any\ncharity events at Imperial.\n|| You'll also head up the\nII team that organises the\n\u00a7| annual ICU RAG Week.\nIt's more hard work than\n11 you've ever i mag med, but\nit's more fun than you\ncould possibly ask for too.\nI promise!

    "content": "this week\nEditorial\nI'm afraid I'm feeling a lot better this week. How dull is\nthat? I'm unlikely to rant\nabout anything to speak of,\nand what makes it worse is\nthat I now have this entire column to fill, and frankly I don't really feel up to it. I may actually have to write a proper edi-to rial, and discuss sensibly\nand with forethought some\nitem of news that fills one of\nthe earlier pages. I don't know\nwhy this is. Apparently it's a tradition, or an old charter, or\nsomething. But anyway, my\nopinion is obviously more\nimportant than anyone else's, so I get a whole page to\nexpress my unsubstantiated\nand ill-though out opinions.\nI woke up in a strange place\nyesterday, and was wandering back in the direction of\nCollege when I received a phone call reminding me of\nthe opening of the Charing\nCross Bar. This may not actually mean much to many of\nyou, since I have been made\naware of the fact that most\nnon-medics are under the\nimpression that all the medics\nare in the BMS. This isn't true.\nThere are many other campuses dotted round London (none\nof them actually named after\nthe part of London they're in,\nbut hey, then people might\nactually be able to find them. I actually went to Charing\nCross, once. How stupid did I feel?)\nAnyhow, there's a big hospital in Hammersmith called\nCharing Cross (CX), and it has\na lot of students in it, and they\nused to have this bar, affectionately referred to as the\n'airport lounge', and it really\nwasn't very nice. Certainly\npeople retained some sort of\nmisguided affection for the\nplace, but there we are.\nThen came a man called\nLome (who shall forever be\nspoken of in hushed tones,\nbut I met him once, oh yes I did), and he managed to\nsecure 1.5 million pounds to\nredo the place (cutting quite a long story short). 1.5 million!\nAnd this guy's only a student.\nI think that deserves a round\nof applause, because with\nthis cash they have refurbished the bar in CX, and I have to say it was really quite\npretty.\nBut, boys and girls, this is\nwhere it breaks down. I 've\ngiven up drinking. Can you\nimagine? I have given up for a week, starting from y ester day! A bar opening, and my\nfirst day of not drinking! I was\nnot impressed. And to make it\nworse, the girls behind the\nbar were (for the most part)\nfriendly, but of this lack of\ndrinking they were frankly\ndisparaging (which is a good\nword). How am I meant to flirt\nif I'm not drinking beer, eh?\nTell me that. It is the source of\nmy power. Without it I am\nnothing. Less than nothing. I need alcohol!\nAnd this is only day two, of\nseven. Erk.\nSo, two points. One, go to\nCX bar, because it rocks, and\nthe bar staff are nice (hi,\nlad ieee es). Two, I'm not drink-ing, so for this week you can\nrest safe in the knowledge\nthat I'm not there. And you\ndon't have to be a medic! So if\nyou live in Hammersmith,\nFulham, etc, go there instead\nof the expensive pub down\nthe road. Because it's full of\nstudents, cheaper beer, and it\nmakes more money for the\nUnion as opposed to\nWetherspoons.\nCX Bar is on St. Dunstan's Road, Hammersmith. Head for\nthe hospital, then follow the\ndrunk student noises.\nThis\nWeek\nFriday Weekend\nUnion\nEvents\nDolly Mixtures\nNamed after the infamous philosopher of the\nsame moniker, the special theme this evening\nwill be epistemology.\nNah, only joking.

    "content": "back talk\nNUS already (again!)\nDear Sir,\nI 've seen many student politicians come\nand go at Imperial, and heard most of\nthem come up with some excuse or other\nas to why their year was not the unmitigated success they promised at hustings.\nThe Chairman of the \"Yes to NUS\" cam-pa ign, however, takes the biscuit. You\ndon't have to be in the NUS to find out\nabout student discounts. You don't have\nto be in the NUS to lobby government.\nYou don't have to be in the NUS to provide\nofficer training. But if you elect sabbatical\nofficers who prefer to sit around moaning\nabout their job, take weeks off at a time to\nrun unwanted referendum campaigns,\nwatch lecturer evaluation systems to\nreach Enron-style levels of mismanagement and allow working relationships\nwith other union officers to reach melt-down, then yes, I agree that you need all\nthe help you can get, from anybody,\nincluding the National Union. Maybe\ninstead of running the 'No' campaign, I should have headed up a 'Resign' campaign instead?\nHugs'n 'cuddles,\nAndy Heeps\nChairman, ICU \"No2NUS\" Campaign\n(We won, by the way. 72% of the highest\nturnout ever seen at Imperial. Did I mention that we won?)\nDear Felix,\nLike the majority of students here (at\nleast those who voted), I was relieved to\nsee that IC would not join the NUS, for\nreasons that have been discussed at\nlength around here. The voice of IC seems\nto be \"We can represent ourselves very\nwell, and prefer to do so!\"\nHowever, I hope that this will now effectively be done, and that the students of IC\nwill make their voice heard! Of course, on\nstudent issues such as grants, but also on\nvital subjects such as the current war on\n\"Terrorism\", the environment, and corporate responsibility (that is, assuming not\neveryone here dreams of becoming one of\nthe \"Fat Cats\", a very depressing thought.)\nThe NUS (I'm quite sure) was represented\nat the May Day (peaceful) protest.\nI must say that the huge amount of empty\nmanagerial buzzwords that composed the\nUnion president's statement of intent in\nlast week's Felix did not reassure me very\nmuch in that matter! But being new here,\nI am probably mistaken.\nMatthew Cand\nA Cross Country\nRe: your personal plea (Felix 1233), I find it\na disgrace that you have the audacity to\nprint an article on mud wrestling, and\nplea for more sports articles to be sent in,\nwhen you are sent perfectly good articles\nfrom sports clubs which you decline to\nprint. On February 20th, you were sent an\narticle by David Mulvee, a member of the\nCross-Country club and Hyde Park Relays\ncommittee. It was a review of the largest\nstudent relay race in Britain, which is\norganised by ICU Cross-Country club. It\nwas the 54th running of this annual event\nthat brought over 700 hundred students\nto the college on February 16th, over 280\nof which came from France, The\nNetherlands, Poland, Italy and Germany.\nThey were all accommodated on site and\nthe event went very smoothly. The after-race party included a late license, BBQ,\nand one of the biggest nights the Union\nhas had on a Saturday. The Union, College\nSecurity, and the Conference and\nCatering Dept. were all very helpful in the\norganisation of one of the largest events\nput on by an ICU Club or Society. And that\nis not even going into the race itself! It\nseems that every year you complain\nabout the lack of articles sent in, yet all I seem to hear around college from other\nclubs is disappointment that their articles\nare not published. Maybe you should allocate page space a bit more conservatively rather than give half a side to mud-bathing and countless pages allocated to\nreviews that everyone reads in other\nmagazines. After all, it is a student news-paper, not Empire. Or the NME. Or Time\nOut. Or Hot Tickets...\nYours sincerely,\nDemetrius Onoufriou, Chair of ICUXC\nHyde Park Relays 2002 Committee\nI explained this last week in the sports\nsection., and don't have space here to do\nso again., but I am sorry. Ed\nHave A Column\nDear Felix,\nSpring is here. The old lunacy of winter\nhas faded to be replaced by fresh idiocy.\nHaving returned to this dank pit of suffer-ing, misery and science fiction from a relatively Star Trek-free frolic in the South\nEast to enjoy the futility of attempting\nthose psychoses-given-form known as\nexaminations, I feel it is probably my duty\nto write and complain about something.\nSadly however, I find myself in rather\ngood spirits and while I would love to\nregale you with hilarious stories of struggles between men and poultry, warm ale\nand American tourists, I won't because\nI'm feeling sadistic and don't think you\ndeserve any happiness.\nEver.\nOnce more London has me beset with an\nextraordinary malevolence towards all\nthings human, I am constantly strangled\nby the urge to throw biscuits at children,\nkick dogs and laugh loudly at lost\ntourists.\nWhile my overbearing cloud of pure malice is still in its infantile stages I feel that\nsomething must be done to arrest its\ngrowth before severe damage is done.\nNot to me of course - I'm in little danger of\nharming myself, it's just when people\nturn up with flaming torches and stakes\nit's often difficult to reason with them.\nBasically, what I'm after is focus to my\naggression and ill will. You may be surprised to know that this is in fact leading\nsomewhere, just bear with me.\nNow you see, I am told, though not by\nimpartial sources, that there are some\npretty smart people here, people who\ncould be profitably employed in a youth-ful, educated and vibrant criminal empire.\nICrime or OCsoc, perhaps would be a good starting point, does the Union have\na policy on such things? Of course, we'd be self-funding after a while and the\nunderground intimidation of staff and\npupils would be a formative experience\nfor those still naive in the fields of bribery\nand racketeering (\"Dean Corleone ain't happy...\"). In fact I can't see one fault in\nthe whole nefarious scheme. There you go\nICU, do something right for once, make a little money, this idea's free.\nMerry Christmas,\nPete\n\n"
