Of\ncourse, we\u2019ve gone in\non the whole Bond thing \u2013 but\nwhat did you expect? Craig and\nco shimmying down a red carpet\nright next to our beloved union is\nsomething that weathered Imperial\nindividuals like me will recognise\nnow as something that happens\nevery three years.\nEven if you\u2019re not into 007 and\nhis questionable ethics, which we\ndiscuss in the film section on page\n24, you can read an interview with\nthe enthusiastic bunch who camped\noutside college for two days to get\na prime spot in the crowd. Major\nprops also go to Wilkinson hall\nthough, who made off with the\n20ft Bond poster at the end of the\nred carpet and hung it from their\nbalcony for all to see; if they hadn\u2019t\nhad to take it down because of fire\nregs, they might\u2019ve accidentally\nhosted the premiere\u2019s after party.\nImperial College TV, our very\nown camera-wielding, YouTube\nstardom seeking munchkins, failed\nto sneak into the event, but did\nmanage to bag an interview with\nnew Top Gear presenter Chris\nEvans. Low and behold, Evans took\nA word from the Editor\nEditor-in-Chief\nGrace Rahman\nNews Editor\nCecily Johnson\nComment Editors\nTessa Davey and Vivien\nHadlow\nScience Editors\nJane Courtnell and Lef\nApostolakis\nArts Editors\nIndira Malik, Jingjie Cheng and\nMax Falkenberg\nMusic Editor\nCale Tilford\nFilm Editor\nFred Fyles\nWelfare Editor\nNoor Mulheron\nSports Editors\nKunal Wagle and Josh\nO\u2019Donnell\nPuzzles Editors\nHamish Beck and Roxana\nRadu\nCopy Editors\nHenry Lloyd Bates, Anthony\nVoyage, Alexandra Lim,\nSamuel Tan, Fred Bates,\nMattin Mir-Tahmasebi, Jack\nSteadman and Ahmed Ibrahim\nTechnical Babe\nLuke Granger-Brown\nCover Picture by SONY\nNews\nComment\nFeature\nScience\nMusic\nClubs & Societies\nArts\nFilm\nFood\nWelfare\nPuzzles\nHangman\nSports\n3\n5\n8\n9\n13\n19\n20\n24\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\na shine to the boys, taking hold\nof the interview, and indeed their\nactual camera.Obviously well worth\na watch, that.\nVaguely exciting though the\npremiere was, it\u2019s been a political\nweek, so we have gone a bit serious.\nEver since FELIX was founded,\ndebate has been heard radiating\nfrom our offices, but I\u2019m going\nto confidently assume that no\neditor has ever polled the room on\nwhether we should put a tampon on\nthe cover. Unable to help ourselves,\nwe went for it.\nSo, the House of Commons voted\nto keep taxing sanitary products\nas though they were luxury items.\nGreat. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever\nseen a tampon, dear reader, but I\u2019ll\ntell you, there ain\u2019t nothing luxe\nabout it. Yeah it\u2019s only a 5% tax, but\nit\u2019s the principal.\nThere are lots of things we don\u2019t\nneed but that we choose to buy\nto make our lives a little bit nicer.\nOccasionally, I have a Whole Foods\nquesadilla. People heat their houses\nwith radiators. You don\u2019t choose\nmenstruation,menstruation chooses\nyou, making taxing tampons as\nthough they were non-essential\nbloody madness.\nIn a bizarre turn of events, the\n(unelected) House of Lords (sortof)\nsaved the day (for a bit) by delaying\nthe proposed tax credit cuts. Even\nflying in obscure, but yes, real peers\nlike Andrew Lloyd Webber couldn\u2019t\nswing the vote. Personally though,\nif I was voting to cut the incomes\nof our poorest families by a grand a\nyear, I\u2019d not have flown in from the\nUS in first class. But that\u2019s just me.\nLots has got us riled this week,\nso if you have any feelings about\nanything you read, pop us an email.\nOoh go on, vent. We\u2019re listening.\nWe\u2019ll probably even publish those\nfeelings. It\u2019s like a blog, except\nsomeone besides your mum might\nread it.\nFELIX, Beit Quad,\nPrince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nPrinted by Iliffee Print Cambridge,\nWinship Road, Cambridge\nRegistered Newspaper\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 FELIX 2015\nGot an itch you need to scratch?\nWe want you to write for us.

Arriving at the\nRoundhouse theatre in Camden,\nthey followed the warm up bands\nCatholic Action and The Magic\nGang. The crowd greeted the\nBrummy born band with rapturous\napplause and eager screams as they\nmade their way on stage alongside\nthe \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 theme, oozing\nwith confidence.\nThey dived straight into their new\nmaterial with \u2018Namaste\u2019 entrancing\nthe audience with futuristic sounds\nand effects on the screen behind\nthem, giving the whole room\na hologram and star ship-like\natmosphere. For this swerve in\nsound they used all kinds of musical\nskills from magical synthesiser tones\nto a sassy saxophone to delight the\naudience.The B-town five piece also\nplayed crowd pleasers, returning to\nthe indie Brit-pop ways of their\ndebut album, causing the room to\nerupt to the sound of \u2018Honey\u2019 and\n\u2018King City\u2019.\nIn the heart of their set on came a\npirouetting dancer with a crazy array\nof psychedelic patterns on her dress\nThe band\u2019s eccentric performance made a deep impression on the crowd.

The crowd tripped\nout to this utterly awesome and\neccentric performance, and was\nfinally calmed down at the end of\nthe set by the slower-paced anthems\nof \u2018She Changes The Weather\u2019 and\n\u2018To My Brother\u2019. Throughout the\nshow Austin Williams and his band\nW\nelcome to FELIX\u2019s\nfirst Demo Dump,\na section which will\nhopefully have a\nlong and controversial future. Last\nweek we asked you to send in your\ndemos,and expected to be inundated\nwith emails from eager musicians\nhoping to finally receive recognition\nfrom our esteemed publication.\nUnfortunately, creativity is not a\ncharacteristic trait of most Imperial\nstudents and as a result we received\nonly a single submission. Not a\ngreat start.\nPanicked, we\u2019ve had no other\nchoice but to review Adele\u2019s new\nsingle. Please send in more demos;\nthere is only so much Adele that\nFELIX endure. While the name of\nthis section might imply otherwise,\nnot everything featured in the\nDemo Dump this week is complete\ngarbage (although \u2018Hello\u2019is certainly\nworthy of such a description).\nHello\nIt\u2019s been 3 years since we last\nheard from Adele (2012\u2019s excellent\n\u2018Skyfall\u2019).Her latest single \u2013 the first\nfrom her upcoming album 25 \u2013 has\nseen massive success. It\u2019s already\nbroken the record for the most\nviews on a music video in 24-hours,\nbeating out Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Bad\nBlood\u2019.\nWe\u2019ve always been mystified by\nAdele\u2019s appeal and \u2018Hello\u2019 does little\nto fix this. No one can deny the\npower and range of Adele\u2019s voice\nSend your demos to\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWARNING:\nIf you can\u2019t handle\ncriticism, please don\u2019t\nsend us your music.\nbut it feels wasted here on an anti-climatic, plodding ballad.\nWe would have been spared\nfour minutes of monotony if the\nperson on the other end of Adele\u2019s\nflip-phone had just picked up, and\nthe song could have been avoided\naltogether with a simple Facebook\nmessage.\nThe unimpressive chorus and\nbland, repetitive lyrics result in one\nof the year\u2019s most unwarranted hits;\nthe mass hysteria of the mainstream\nmedia is certainly misplaced. If\nyou\u2019re a fan of Adele (and FELIX\nmaintained an effortless mash up\nof genres (being retro and trippy\nat the same time), commanding a\nthrilling stage persona not unlike\nJoy Division.\nEmerging from Birmingham in\n2012, with their debut album of\nWhere The Heaven Are We only being\nreleased in 2013, you could easily\nmistake them for a band that has\nbeen around for much longer. Swim\nDeep have successfully transformed\nfrom the indie Brit-pop style of\nhazy guitars in their debut to a\nvariety of psychedelic and crazy\nrock sounds in their second album\nMothers. With such a unique style\nand dedicated fan base, Swim Deep\naren\u2019t far from becoming a bright\nstar in this new age of music.\nisn\u2019t) then you should probably\nignore this review and go back to\nlistening Heart Radio.\nAvailable now everywhere\nOpenCircle,SinkingLight\nLittle is known about the\nmysterious Sangre Voss, the alias of\na mildly-talented Imperial student,\nother than that his name translates\nto \u201cblood voss\u201d in Spanish (thanks\nGoogle).

The track features a\nrelatively simple beat, infused with\ndelightful panpipes. At its halfway\npoint growling synths make way\nfor Sangre Voss\u2019 nasal tones which\nsound eerily similar to Joe Newman\nof alt-J. Here at FELIX we rarely\nexpect to be impressed by amateurs,\nbut, Sangre Voss\u2019 latest track is\nsurprisingly good for a producer\nprobably working from his bedroom.\nAvailable now on SoundCloud\nThey used\nall kinds of\nmusical skills,\nfrom magical\nsynthesiser\ntones to\na sassy\nsaxophone\n\n"

A quick\nrefresher for those\nof you that have been living under\na wi-fi free rock, it\u2019s art depicting\nTV or movie characters, often in\nsituations that would never make it\nto the screen. As fan-art has entered\ninto the public consciousness it\nhas been shown as a somewhat\nembarrassing pastime. The Graham\nNorton Show episode featuring\nX-Men: First Class fanart in which\nEric and Charles make out whilst\nbaking cookies is a case in point. It\nwas not entirely a misrepresentation,\na quick search of fan-art on Tumblr\nor Deviantart, the epicentres of\nfandom activity, will reveal more\nclumsy iterations of Frodo and Sam\nmaking out, or Harry and Draco\ninvolved in an illicit affair than you\nwould care to imagine. Gratuitous\ncostumes are often involved\nDig a little deeper however and\nfan-art is likely to surprise.Amongst\nthe reams of enthusiastically, but\nslightly less than skilfully drawn\nscenes, are true works of art.\nThey are beautifully imagined,\nand realised with virtuoso skill.\nTumblr user euclase is an artist\nwhose creations rarely put a foot\nwrong. She draws portraits of TV\nshow characters, focusing mainly\non Supernatural. Her paintings, all\ndrawn digitally using Photoshop\nand a Wacom tablet are almost\nlyrical, drawing inspiration from the\nOld Masters in their use of colour\nand light. The faces of her subjects\nseems to glow from within and the\nshadows are rich with burnt umber\nGingerhaze became a fandom superstar after drawing Broship of the Ring. Photo Credit: Noelle Stevenson\nSherlock as painted by Euclase. Photo Credit: Euclase\nand ultramarine blue tones. Euclase\nmanages to imbue her portraits with\nfeeling and character.\nAlice Zhang\u2019s (tumblr user alicexz)\npaintings are similarly accomplished\nbut entirely different in style. She\ndraws digital paintings that are high\ncontrast and supersaturated with\ncolour. Her drawings are awash\nwith vivid orange, lemon yellow,\nand cerulean. Her brushstrokes,\nfar from being photorealistic are\nfluid and stylistically deft. She\nhas become most known for her\npaintings showing the Doctor in his\ndifferent incarnations. Her ubiquity\nin the Doctor Who fandom caught\nhe eyes of the powers that be at the\nBBC. Now her art is featured on\nthe covers of the Doctor Who comics\npublished by Titan. Her painting\nof movie scenes, ranging from The\nHunger Games to Drive has gained\nher two solo exhibitions (Moments\nand Moments II) at the Bottleneck\nGallery in New York.\nMany artists keep painting fan-art no matter how much fame they\nachieve. For some, however, it can\noffer the way into launching their\noriginal work to a wider audience.\nA few years ago, Noelle Stevenson\n(tumblr user gingerhaze) burst onto\nthe Lord of the Rings fandom with\nendearing line drawings of the \u2018Broship of the Ring\u2019. She imagined\nGandalf as an old stoner, Shadowfax\nas a green VW camper van, the\nhobbits as tiny hipsters and Legolas\nas a preppy blond with slicked back\nhair. Aragorn is a plaid wearing\nlumberjack. She shot to instant\nfame. After gaining a wide and loyal\nfollowing, 3 years ago she launched\na webcomic, Nimona. Through the\nyears that have followed, in biweekly instalments she told the\nstory of a shape shifting young\ngirl apprenticed to a supervillan\n(who is not really villainous after\nall) and their nemesis. The story of\nNimona, Sir Ballister Blackheart\nand Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin\nso captured the imagination of\nmillions of her fans around the\nworld that on its ending last year,\nthe webcomic went offline and\nwas procured by HarperCollins to\nbe made into a paperback. Nimona\nhas earned Stevenson New York\nTimes Bestseller status as well as\nnumerous awards nominations and\nwins including Harvey and Eisner\nAwards and Slate Cartoonist Studio\nPrize for Best Web Comic in 2012.\nShe has since illustrated the cover\nfor Rainbow Rowell\u2019s young adult\nnovel Eleanor and Park, written\nfor DC and Marvel Comics, been\na writer on the Disney TV series\nWander Over Yonder and has another\noriginal comic in the works in the\nform of Lumberjanes for Boom!\nStudios. It is hard to envisage such\nheady heights of success in such\nshort an amount of time without\nthe help of fan-art.\nFor those talented and lucky\nenough, fan-art can offer the\nopportunity to kickstart a successful\ncareer. Being an artist on Tumblr\nis equivalent of singing covers of\npopular song on YouTube in hopes\nWhat\nelse is the\nSistine\nChapel\nceiling but\nBible fan-art?\nof attracting a recording deals with\nYouTube, being a popular fan-artist\nis surprisingly lucrative. Most artists\nhave etsy shops selling prints of their\nartwork on canvas , on tote bags, on\niPhone cases. Most of these artists\nattend conventions and expos, at\nwhich many, like Zhang, are treated\nlike celebrities. It is one thing to be\ncommercially successful, and quite\nanother to be taken seriously as an\nartist. by the mainstream art world\nIt is difficult to see these young\nwomen (and it is predominantly\nwomen who are most active in\nfandoms) being hailed as the next\ngreat artists in their respective\ncountries. Fan-art is still seen as\nsomething slightly embarrassing,\nand definitely entirely frivolous. Yet,\n\u2018fan-art\u2019 by another name ruled the The Eleventh Doctor. Photo Credit: Alice Zhang.\n& me arse is freezin- the seat\u2019s plastic\n& a smartphone held up & the green\nthrough it is as green as a carlsberg\nlets have a minutes silence for carlsberg\nshoulders together, huddlin like & stan\u2019s\nsignin his heart out- me arse is freezin\ngive us somethin more grey than a 1-1 at home\n& i wanna go meet the players & all i can look at\nis sky mowing \u201cbelieve in better\u201d into the grass, the cold\n& by the side theres cheerleaders now &\nnothin is slow, evrythin is the pace it was bought to be\nhendo\u2019s hair is perfect as the frost\non me freezin arse the bevvies in our bellies is gettin\njiggly from all the shoutin & the warmth in here is somewhere\nin the jumpin & shit where the fuck is stan\noh my god stan r u ok get some carlsberg on that\nur arse must be freezin give us somethin to hold onto\nboth sets of players warming up\nby Kieran Ryan\nBeing a\nfan-artist is\nsurprisingly\nlucrative\nart world during the Renaissance.\nWhat else was Michaelangelo\npainting in the Sistine Chapel\nbut Bible fan-art? In case you\u2019re\nwondering, Bible fandom is a real\nthing, check out Millenial Gospel\non tumblr. Caravaggio\u2019s Narcissus is\nOvid fan-art, every artists who has\never drawn Helen of Troy or Sirens\nof the Battle of Try is swinging on\nthe coattails of Homer.These artists\ntoo often drew religious or mythical\nart to fund their secular artistic\ninterests.\nReligious paintings and paintings\nfrom myth have somewhat fallen\nout of favour in recent centuries.\nInstead popular culture, a religion\nunto itself has taken its place. Even\n\u2018serious\u2019 artists are not immune.\nThe National Portrait Gallery is\nevidence enough of that, artists\ndraw portraits of celebrities all the\ntime to reach wider audience. It\u2019s\nnot so far a leap to be drawing TV\ncharacters. Fan-art is an invaluable\ntool for young artists, and with the\nrise and rise of celebrity culture, it\u2019s\nonly a matter of time before fan-artists achieve critical as well as\ncommercial success.\n\n"

However,\nthe British Heart Foundation\nestimates that over 1,200 people in\nneed of a heart transplant die every\nyear. In the mid-1990s, over 250\nheart transplants took place each\nyear, but that number has steadily\ndecreased as fewer suitable hearts\nwere made available.\nNow, researchers at Carnegie\nMellon University have\ndemonstrated a new technique\nthat allows soft tissue to effectively\nbe 3D printed. Bioprinting, the\ntechnique of layering cells to \u2018print\u2019\nan organic object, has been around\nfor about a decade. However, up \u2018til\nnow, the soft materials it created\ntended to collapse under their\nown weight. This new research,\npublished in the journal Science\nAdvances, eliminates the problem\nand pioneers a technique that prints\nthe biological tissues in a gelatin\nsolution, which provides structural\nsupport. Adam Feinberg, one of\nthe authors of the study, explained:\n\u201cEssentially, we print on gel inside\nof another gel, which allows us to\naccurately position the soft material\nas it\u2019s being printed, layer-bylayer.\u201d This gel is thermoreversible,\nmeaning it will melt when brought\nup to body temperature, allowing\nthe printed materials to be removed\nwithout damaging the molecules.\nFreeform Reversible Embedding\nLooks like\neveryone\u2019s\nfavourite\nbacon and\nasbestos\nroll is off\nthe college\ncaf\u00e9 menu\nnow\nAlcohol\nChronic inflammation\nObesity\nRadiation\nSunlight\nSam Lickiss\nWriter\nRussia keeping an eye on its researchers\n3D printers can now be used in Bioprinting.

Now,\nscientists have been instructed\nto run all research manuscripts by\nthe national security service before\nsubmitting research to journals and\nconferences, as revealed by minutes\nfrom a Belozersky Institute meeting.\nOf course, like in the case of\nmost countries, Russian laws have\nbeen in place for decades to control\nmilitary research or even industrial\nsignificance. However, last spring,\na decree was passed by President\nVladimir Putin to include more\nor less any research in the \u2018in need\nof security service approval\u2019 list.\nResearch that needs such approval\nincludes anything that comes under\nthe blanket term \u2018new products\u2019.\nThis new level of bureaucracy\naccompanying Russian research\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nVladimir Putin. Enough said. Photo\nCredit: Wikipedia\nLooks like everyone\u2019s favourite,\nbacon and asbestos roll is off the\ncollege caf\u00e9 menu now.\nThis week, the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) issued long\nawaited new guidelines placing\nprocessed meat in Category 1, or\n\u2018causes cancer\u2019. It also placed red\nmeat (beef, pork and lamb) in\nCategory 2a, or \u2018probably causes\ncancer\u2019. For clarification, \u201cprocessed\nmeat\u201d means anything that has been\ntreated to extend shelf life or modify\ntaste. Sadly, that does include bacon\nand sausages.\nTo a certain extent this isn\u2019t news.\nThe classification was coordinated\nby the International Agency for\nResearch on Cancer (IARC),\nwhich examined over 800 published\nstudies on the link between cancer\nand processed meat.\nUnfortunately the new\nclassification for processed meat as\n\u2018causes cancer\u2019 means it joins 118\nother substances that, based on\nsufficient evidence, cause cancer.\nAnd yes, that list does also include\nasbestos, cigarettes, smokeless\ntobacco and alcohol.\nProfessor David Philips from\nCancer Research UK made a\nessentially means is that IARC\nisn\u2019t in the business of telling us\nhow potent something is in causing\ncancer \u2013 just whether it does or\nnot. Take the analogy of banana\nskins, for example. They can cause\naccidents,but in practice this doesn\u2019t\nhappen very often (unless you work\nin a banana factory). And the sort of\nharm you can come to from slipping\non a banana skin is generally not as\nsevere as,say,being in a car accident.\nBut under a hazard identification\nsystem like IARC\u2019s, \u2018banana skin\u2019\nand \u2018cars\u2019 would come under that\nsame category \u2013 they both definitely\ndo cause accidents.\u201d\nWhat is important is to\nunderstand what is meant by risk.\nThe conflation of the IARC classing\nprocessed meat as \u2018causes cancer\u2019\nand newspaper headlines claiming\nthey are \u201cas a big a cancer threat\u201d as\nsmoking is completely misleading\nand unacceptable.\nSo before we start making people\neat bacon sandwiches outside\nthe pub in the rain or labelling\npackets with \u2018sausages kill\u2019, we\nneed to examine the actual risk to\nhealth. The IARC has said that\nconsuming 50g of processed meat a\nday increases your risk of colorectal\ncancer by 18%, whereas smoking\nposes a much greater risk to public\nhealth, as clearly shown by the\ncancer research UK infographic.\nThe only similarity is that studies\nhave shown both cause cancer.\nSo the final question is: Should we\nstop eating red meat and processed\nmeat? Professor Key from CRUK\nand University of Oxford says \u201cthe\ndecision doesn\u2019t mean you need to\nstop eating any red and processed\nmeat,but if you eat lots of it you may\nwant to think about cutting down.\nEating a bacon bap every once in a\nwhile isn\u2019t going to do much harm\n\u2013 having a healthy diet is all about\nmoderation.\u201d\nSo no, eating bacon and red\nmeat does not pose the same risk\nas smoking. Looks like the old-fashioned rule rings clear and true\n\u2013 staying healthy is all about a\nbalanced diet and moderation.\nConsuming\n50g of\nprocessed\nmeat a day\nincreases\nyour risk of\ncolorectal\ncancer by\n18%\n\u201cWHO\u201d might cause cancer?\nInfectious Agents\nAge\nThe burning of coal\nOral Contraception\nMenopausal Hormone Therapy\nTobacco\nImmunosuppressant\nHIV type 1 infection\nMagenta\nPickled Vegetables\nThe textile manufacturing industry\nBeing a hairdresser\nBeing a barber\nShiftwork\n4-Vinylcyclohexene\nRefractory ceramic fibres\nUracil mustard\nAndrogenic Steroids\nWood dust\nLeather dust\nof Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH)\nprovides a foundation upon which\nwhole, functioning organs can be\nmanufactured from a patient\u2019s own\ncells in the future. Bespoke organs\nare still some way off, but the team\nis already looking to add further\ncomplexity to their bioprinted\nstructures.\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do\nnow is to try and incorporate cardiac\nis not merely burdensome for\nscientists, but as some point out,\ncould be bad for science.\nScientists could become reluctant\nto share or even openly talk about\nmyocytes, which are heart muscle\ncells, into those tissue constructs as\nwe\u2019re printing them,\u201d says Feinberg.\nNevertheless, the team is already\nbeginning to produce structures that\ncould be used to repair damaged\nhearts, negating the need for a\ntransplant altogether.\nRemarkably, the team was able to\nachieve this by using a consumer-level 3D printer. They further\nutilised open-source hardware and\nsoftware to improve efficiency and\nlower costs.\u201cWe have access to fine-tune the print parameters, optimise\nwhat we\u2019re doing, and maximise\nthe quality of what we\u2019re printing,\u201d\nFeinberg said.\nThe boom in recent years in\ncollaborative, open-source projects\nhas greatly improved scientists\u2019\naccessibility to the tools they need\nto conduct their research. Indeed,\nwe can expect to see rapid advances\nin biotechnology.\nFaced with an aging population,\nthe demand for new hearts, and\nother organs, isn\u2019t going away.\nEven with conventional transplant\nsurgery,around half of the recipients\nof new hearts die within ten years.\nFurthermore, suitable hearts may\nbe difficult to source, as they need\nto be biologically compatible with\nthe recipient. Improved bioprinting\ntechnologies could eliminate these\nproblems, prolonging lifespans and\npreventing needless deaths.\nAn increase\nin sanctions\nand\ncontrols is\ncausing the\nbrightest to\nleave\ntheir science, especially if it is seen\nas work that in any way criticizes\nthe government.\nIn a recent interview, Sergey\nSalikhov, director of the Russian\nScience Ministry\u2019s science and\ntechnology department (purposely\nmade a mouthful to deter journalists\nfrom contacting him), reassured\nNature that the decree would not\nbe interfering with \u2018\u2019basic science\u201d.\nThen again, you could argue that no\none can really interfere with \u2018\u2019basic\nscience\u2019\u2019 without access to a time\nmachine and Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s\naddress, because really, research\nnowadays is anything but basic.\nBut if this new move for secrecy\nis so bad, where is the outcry from\nthe Russian scientific community?\nViachev Shuper of the Russian\nAcademy of Sciences claims that\nmany Russian scientists \u201cdon\u2019t\ndare to speak openly, but I know\nthat many are very unhappy about\nthe degradation of their academic\nfreedom\u201d.\nThis might explain the recent\nbrain drain some say Russia has\nbeen going through. According\nto data published by the Russian\nFederal Statistics Service (Rosstat),\nin the first eight months of 2014,\napproximately 204,000 people\nemigrated from Russia. According\nto emigration consultant Sergei\nKuznetsov,themajorityofemigrants\nare middle and upper-middle class.\nAn increase in sanctions and\ngovernment controls is causing\nthe countries \u2018\u2019brightest minds in\nfinance and technology\u2019\u2019 to take\nflight, as highlighted by Bloomberg\nBusiness last year.\nMany of the country\u2019s big\ncompanies are moving staff and\nheadquarters to more liberal\nenvironments, where they can\noperate more freely. The list includes\nGame Insight LCC, Toonbox\nanimation studio and VKontakte.\nWhat\u2019s more, the government\u2019s\nleash only seems to be getting\nshorter. Now that science\ninstitutions across the country\nare trying to impose controls on\nresearch staff, perhaps we will see a\nnew wave of emigration as scientists\nfollow the lead of Russia.\nThat awkward moment when you need to go through national security before\nsubmitting a paper\nUsing a\nconsumer\nlevel 3D\nprinter\nstatement about the findings:\n\u201cIARC does \u2018hazard identification\u2019\nnot \u2018risk assessment\u2019. That sounds\nquite technical, but what it\n\n"

On the whole, VAT is meant\nto be a tax on items that people don\u2019t\nabsolutely need, but buy to increase\ntheir quality of life above a standard\nlevel. It follows that there are some\nthings that are classed as essential,\nand are subject to no VAT at all.\nThe list of items deemed essential\nenough to avoid VAT is extensive,\nand includes such necessities as\nsandwiches (but only if they\u2019re cold),\nnuts (if the shells aren\u2019t removed)\nand biscuits (unless, god forbid,\nthey\u2019re chocolate-covered).\nAlso on the list are incontinence\npads; this one is understandable, as\nnot-wetting-yourself-everywhere\nseems like a fairly basic requirement\nfor a reasonably comfortable life.\nYou might expect that not-leaking-menstrual-fluid-everywhere would\nhold similar status. Apparently not.\nCurrently, sanitary products count\nas \u2018non essential luxury items\u2019, and\nare subject to a VAT rate of 5%.\nThis has already been reduced from\n17.5% in 2001 after a campaign\nunder Brown\u2019s Labour government,\nbut the question remains: why is it\nnot 0%?\nAt the time the initial reduction\nwas announced, it was not possible\nto reduce it to zero because of certain\nEU regulations. On Monday, a vote\nwas held in the House of Commons\non the proposal to negotiate the\nmatter with the EU, and was\ndefeated 305-287.\nIn the flurry of commentaries\nfollowing it, there seems to be one\ncommon theme in support of the\nresult: there are more important\nthings to be worrying about.\nWhile I understand this to some\nextent \u2013 5% is hardly a huge burden\non the buyer \u2013 it is the principle of\nthe thing that has made people so\nirate.\nIt is inarguably a tax that charges\nwomen for managing a bodily\nfunction they do not choose to\nhave, and the fact that MPs voted\nagainst getting rid of it is far more\ndisturbing than the tax itself.\nVAT rules are weird anyway, and\n5% isn\u2019t that much \u2013 but the message\nthat the House of Commons has\nsent with this vote is clear: equality\nis just not that important.\nBuy your own fucking sweets, mate\nThe Angry Grad\nColumnist\nT\nhere are many things that\nirritate me more than my\nchafing thighs, but this\nweek\u2019s focus, Halloween,\ngets more on my tits than Dr Eva\nCarneiro did on Jose Mourinho\u2019s.\nFrom jack-o(ff)-lanterns, to shito\u2019-treating, this hyper-popular\nAmericanism grates on me more\nthan a dry shave in the heat of\nsummer, and here\u2019s why.\nFirstly, in my day, chomping\nchoccie from \u2018Uncle Ian\u2019up the road\nset alarm bells ringing. The stranger\ndanger fear was real,but now,on the\nglorious Ocotber the 31st\n, kids are\nset lose on the streets, like dweebs at\nASDA on Black Friday, to scavenge\nthe best collection of teeth-rotting\nand insulin-spiking confections.\nThe logic behind this genuinely\nblows my mind. I mean, do all the\ncreeps refrain from spiking their\nsweets on one day of the year or\nsomething? I THINK NOT. Yes,\nI am a massive cynic, and yes, this\nfear is synonymous with paranoia,\nbut would you use Kanye\u2019s music\nas medicine, just because he once\nsaid they were the same thing? No,\nunless you\u2019ve got man-flu, in which\ncase, only Yeezy can help you get\nover it, you pathetic, sniffily melt.\nIn any case, while I do struggle\nwith the idea, I appreciate the\nsentiment and thus, I\u2019m all set for\nhanding out Haribo to an already\nhyperactive toddler in an Elsafrom-Frozen costume. But when\na group of 17 year olds, \u2018drunk\u2019 on\nWKD and indecency, bang on\nThis hyper\npopular\nAmericanism\ngrates on me\nmore than a\ndry shave in\nthe heat of\nsummer\nReally, who pays for these things? Photo Credit: Costumeish\nIf your costume is culturally insensitive I hope you don\u2019t get laid at ACC\nHouse of Lords does right thing?\nDid the House of Lords overstep the mark in delaying proposed tax credit cuts?\nBen Sharpless\nWriter\nCameron vowed not to increase tax credits Photo Credit: Mirror\nG\neorge Osbourne\u2019s new\nfavourite line to describe\nthe Conservatives is\n\u201cthe party of working\npeople\u201d. Over the last three years,\nsince he was booed at the London\nOlympics opening ceremony,\nOsbourne has undergone a\ntransformation, reinventing himself\nas a person and a politician.\nHe\u2019s lost two stone to try to\nimprove his public image, widened\nhis political vocabulary to include\nall kinds of clever political spiel and\ntried to re-brand the Conservatives\nas a party in the centre of the\nspectrum in an effort to close the\npolitical gap between them and\nLabour.\nBut however hard he tries to make\nus believe it, the Conservatives can\u2019t\nbe the party of working people if\nthey take away money from working\npeople.\nBefore the 2015 election, David\nCameron appeared on TV and\nstated that if his party won, they\nwould not cut tax credits, a scheme\nintroduced by Labour to boost the\nsalaries of low paid workers and\nfamilies.Now they are in power,they\nare trying to introduce a cut to tax\ncredits that will affect two million\nworking families with children and\nlow household incomes, something\nthat directly contradicts another of\nOsbourne\u2019s buzzphrases \u2013 that he\nwants to \u201cmake work pay\u201d. \u00a34.4bn\npounds worth of cuts are planned,\nwith an expected average loss to\nfamilies (with children) of \u00a31000\neach in the year 2020.\nThe plan isn\u2019t just unpopular with\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats,\nit has even caused a schism in\nOsbourne\u2019s own party.\nAs of Monday, the House of\nLords has joined in too, voting to\ndelay Osborne\u2019s proposed cuts, and\ncomplete a more thorough assess\nment of their impact. The House of\nLords hasn\u2019t done this in 100 years\nand some senior Conservatives are\nup in arms that an unelected body of\npeers can overturn their proposals.\nWhile the House of Lords is\noutdated and needs reforming, I\nthink that in this case, they have\ndone the right thing.The Lords may\nbe unelected, but this part of the\nConservatives\u2019 election campaign\nwas a lie. And of course, they\u2019re\ngetting all the bad news out of the\nway now in the hope that it will all\nbe forgotten by 2020.\nThe argument against tax credits\nis that they effectively subsidise\ncompanies who don\u2019t pay their\nemployees a high enough wage.\nWhile there may be an element of\ntruth to that, this is not the way to\ngo about reforming the situation.\nIn trying to justify Osbourne\u2019s tax\ncredit cuts and reform to the system,\nBoris Johnson said that he \u201chopes\u201d\nmore companies will sign up to the\nLondon living wage. What kind of\na reform is one that takes money\naway from working people and\nrelies on \u201chope\u201d to give it back?\nA period is for life, not just\nfor Halloween.

That\u2019s how\nthe Queen\u2019s managed to keep the\nthrone for so long.\nFrom the under-dressed to the\nover, Halloween may as well be\nrenamed whore-oween, because my\nGod do some lassies take the Mean\nGirls commandment of it being\n$60? Almost sold out? Are you fucking kidding me? Photo Credit: BrandsonSale\nokay to dress slutty too far. While I\nappreciate that if you got it,flaunt it,\nbeing peng doesn\u2019t mean displaying\nyour red crotch from that brazillian\nyou had earlier in that skimpy\nleopard print leotard.\nSeriously ladies, less is genuinely\nmore, and leaving something for the\nimagination is totally empowering.\nIn fact, my real respect is to those\ngals going ghoulish this year, and I\ndon\u2019t mean a cutesy bit of smudged\nlippy. I\u2019m talking about the whole\ndarn shebang. Go HAM with the\nfake blood, face paint and zombie\ncontact lenses, because this is one\nnight of the year, where looking\nterrifyingly fugly is a-okay.

Plus, you won\u2019t lose your\nself-esteem the next morning when\nyou trawl through your snaps \u2013 you\u2019ll\nlook disgusting, but on purpose!\nWhile I could rant \u2018til the end of\ntime, I\u2019ll finish on one last issue; the\ntrue consequences of choosing trick\nover treat. Like, WTF will actually\nhappen? I may have to try it this\nyear when a BO laden post-GCSE\nmug dares to knock on my door.\nDon\u2019t bloody shout trick-or-treat\nin my face if you\u2019ve not actually\nplanned a chuckle-worthy prank,\nin case I choose the former, you\ncretin. Arrogance is up there in my\ntop three pet hates, (along with full\nsized cup-cake shaped cakes and\nautomatically flushing toilets) and if\nyou don\u2019t deliver, you have no right\nto expect me to.\n\n"

The\nfreeform, jazz-like unkemptness\nof the narrative only serves to\nstrengthen this; you feel the lack\nof direction not just in the film but\nwithin the lives and the souls of the\nprotagonists.\nMississippi Grind has this in\ncommon with its directors\u2019 more\nwell-known film Half Nelson.\nP\nerhaps the most well-known of director Werner\nHerzog\u2019s many entries into\nthe documentary genre,\nGrizzly Man tells the story of\nTimothy Treadwell and his thirteen\nsummers spent in the Alaskan\nwilderness, which he claimed was\nthe only way of protecting its\nnative grizzly bears from poachers.\nHis story is ultimately brought\nto an end during Treadwell\u2019s\nthirteenth summer, when he and\nhis girlfriend Amie Huguenard\nwere killed by one of the bears with\nwhich he supposedly shared a close\nrelationship.\nTreadwell\u2019s tragic \u2013 though\nundeniably unusual \u2013 story is made\nup of an edit of over 90 hours of\nfootage he filmed himself in the\nstyle of a strange, childish nature\ndocumentary, intertwined with\ninterviews conducted by Herzog.\nThe result is a uniquely personal\nlook at the character of Treadwell \u2013\na flawed and deeply insecure person.\nKnown for his hands-off approach\nto documentary film making,\nHerzog \u2013 reminiscent of Louis\nTheroux \u2013 allows people to expose\nthemselves by saying absolutely\nnothing himself. An example of\nthis style is seen when Treadwell\u2019s\n\u2018close friend\u2019 Warren Queeny gives\nthe camera an obviously rehearsed\nand almost comically hammy\nmonologue about his lost friend;\nthe static, lengthy shot of Warren\ncombines with the way in which the\nscene was shot to allow us to feel\nthe \u2018fakeness\u2019 of the performance.\nThis kind of subtle story-telling is\nsomething very few documentarians\ncould pull off.\nThemajorquestionexploredinthis\nfilm is what exactly was Treadwell\ndoing spending months at a time in\nthe exclusive company of bears and\nfoxes? Was he an inveterate liar?\nWas he just a passionate lunatic?\nOne interpretation is simply that\nTreadwell stayed in this secluded\nworld, one which he romanticised\nto a near ridiculous degree, in an\nattempt to escape the realities of the\nreal one.\nWorth noting is the unusual\nchild-like wonder with which\nTreadwell refers to nature and its\ninhabitants in his footage; by giving\nhis supposed \u2018bear-friends\u2019 names\nsuch as \u2018Mr Chocolate\u2019,Treadwell is\nshown to sentimentalise the natural\nworld. He seemed to see it as a\nbenevolent and balanced system \u2013 a\nview, it is suggested, that comforted\nhim. This view is coldly cut down\nby the voice of Herzog who, in one\nscene involving Treadwell sharing a\n\u2018moment\u2019 with a bear, says that its\n\u201cblank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food\u201d;it is clear that\nHerzog sees Treadwell as someone\ntrying to discredit cruelty in order\nto continue his own comforting\nworld-view. Ultimately however,\nHerzog did not make this film\nto discredit and mock Treadwell.\nInstead he merely presents to us a\nstudy of modern humanity \u2013 one\nthat is as entertaining as it is bizarre.\nBEN COLLIER\nIf you\u2019ve never woken up with a casino membership card in your back pocket, you haven\u2019t lived.

He\u2019s not the\ncheeriest person in the world \u2013 he\nstudies biology, who could blame\nhim? \u2013 but in my mind he certainly\nhad a point.\nThe Bond movies have been\nfuelling the fantasies of children,\ngrown-ups, and grown-up children\nfor generations, and it looked like\nthey would be unstoppable after\nhaving survived the \u201cgritty reboot\u201d\ntrend of the late noughties, like\nBatman Begins and 2009\u2019s Star Trek.\nCasino Royale redefined\nBond for the 21st\nCentury, with\npowerfully tangible action, excellent\nperformances with the perfect\namount of realism to them, and\ncraftsmanship that allowed the\nfranchise to transcend simple\naction-movie escapism and become\na genuinely great film. The sins of\nthe following Quantum of Solace\nwere soon forgiven as Skyfall was\nhailed as a fantastic return to form\nbut, looking back at it, there was\nsomething a little off. It had begun\nto rehash the trademarks of older\nBond movies in the form of daft\nplot points, yet it attempted to\nkeep a straight face whilst doing it;\nretrospectively the balance didn\u2019t\nquite work.\nPerhaps this is why Spectre\u2019s\nproduction team decided to ramp up\nthe escapism even further, so much\nso that the artfully-done action\nsetpieces of Skyfall feel stiff and\ngreyscaled in comparison.The latest\nentry in the Bond franchise is fully-fledged old-school 007; sweeping\naction spectacle, cool cars, gadgets,\nand dry martinis. The opening\nsequence says it all; a flashy tracking\nshot follows Bond (Daniel Craig)\nthrough the streets of Mexico City\non the Day of the Dead festival to\nthe hotel room of an attractive\nyoung woman who snogs him then\nsaunters over to the bed, whereon\nhe mumbles \u201cI won\u2019t be a minute\u201d\nand promptly hops out of the\nwindow with a rifle strapped to his\nside. This is followed by an airborne\nbrawl with a helicopter pilot and\npassenger, complete with hanging\noutside of the cabin and multiple\nsomersaults \u2013 in broad daylight, no\nless \u2013 arriving at a smooth segue into\nthe opening credits,accompanied by\nimages of Craig topless with faceless\nblondes stroking his shoulders and\nproducing fire. This isn\u2019t the Bond\nyou might remember, but it\u2019s the\none your dad will.\nWhere this refreshed, enjoyable\napproach makes itself most clear\nis in the performances. Craig\u2019s\nBond, which will most likely be\nremembered as one of the best\noverall, has a reinvigorated sense of\ndry humour. Ralph Fiennes\u2019 M is\njoyously stony-faced and grumpy.\nBen Wishaw\u2019s Q gets a lovable\ntouch of the modern tech geek.\nDave Bautista\u2019s performance as\nMr Hinx is a classic piece of pure,\nterrifying muscle \u2013 one of the best\nsequences in the film has at its\ncentre him gouging out a man\u2019s eyes\nwith his thumbs because the man\nhappens to be sat in a chair he wants\nto be sitting in, all without a word.\nNone are more gleeful than that of\nChristoph Waltz, who lies coiled at\nthe heart of the movie in a perfect\nthrowback role, with a knowing\nvillainous smile and his trademark\nAustrian accent practically dripping\nwith cheese.\nBut with a switch back to the\nsensibilities of old, Spectre\u2019s missteps\nshow up problems not just with\nthe movie itself, but with the Bond\nfranchise as a whole. The modern\naction movie has been reworked so\nmany times this decade it\u2019s hard to\nkeep track, but with milestones like\nthe exhilarating Mad Max: Fury\nRoad so fresh in our minds it\u2019s hard\nnot to realise that there\u2019s something\nmissing in the action. Explosions\nare epic but distant, punches clip\nbut never connect.A bigger problem\nwith the film can be outlined by\ncomparing its torture scene with\nthat of Casino Royale. One of the\nhighlights of an already brilliant\nfilm, the \u201crope-torture\u201d sequence\nfeaturing Le Chiffre and Bond in a\nThe Babadook\nHorror films often get a bad rap\nof being rather stupid. The Babadook\ncompletely defies this myth. It tells\nthe story of the recently widowed\nAmelia, who is terrorised at the\nhands of a monster, perhaps more\ndeeply linked with her inner demons\nthan one may think. The film oozes\nwith metaphors, unsettling imagery,\nand intensely interesting ideas.\nSinister\nThere seems to be a theme in some\nrecent horror films: a big-name\nactor (in this case, Ethan Hawke) is\nhired in place of the traditional no-name lead. Here, for once, this idea\nactually works: Hawke\u2019s incredible\nperformance carries this film, whose\nunique premise and execution is\ncentres around brutal murders\nrecorded on Super 8mm reels.\nMama\nBased on the short film of the\nsame name, Mama tells the story\nof two children left for dead who\nare \u2018adopted\u2019 by a mysterious entity,\nwhich then follows and terrifies\ntheir eventual guardians.The design\nof Mama herself is one of the most\nterrifying you will see in any horror\nfilm, and the whole experience is\none of classic horror, done right.\nbasement room with no escape felt\nreal, dangerous, and quite frankly\nterrifying. In comparison, Spectre\u2019s\ntorture scene leaves Bond strapped\nto a chair while Waltz\u2019s entire plot\nis revealed during a conveniently\nelaborate procedure aiming for a\nslow and painful death.It\u2019s moments\nlike this that were parodied in\nanother excellent recent action film,\nKingsman: The Secret Service \u2013 major\nplot points that are so easy on our\nhero that it makes it hard to feel\nany sense of danger. On top of all\nthis, the man himself unfortunately\nremains quite the sexual harassment\ncase. I\u2019m not sure what the protocol\nis on sleeping with the widow of a\nman you threw out of a helicopter\n(Monica Bellucci\u2019s literal only scene\nin the movie), but the scene itself is\nquite a disturbing one out of a Bond\ncontext (or even in one).\nCasino Royale remains by far the\nmost accomplished of Craig\u2019s Bond\nfilms, and on technical terms Skyfall\nmight well be slightly better. But for\nsheer thrill and enjoyment,Spectre is\ncertainly a hell of a lot more fun.\nTOM STEPHENS\nThis isn\u2019t\nthe Bond\nyou might\nremember,\nbut it\u2019s the\none your\ndad will\nEach petty\nattempt\nat theft\nbecomes\nanother kick\nin the gut\nThis is\nfollowed by\nan airborne\nbrawl with\na helicopter\npilot\nSomething else the two share is\na powerhouse lead. Whilst Half\nNelson boasts Ryan Gosling\u2019s first\ntruly great performance, Mississippi\nGrind has up its sleeve the role Ben\nMendelssohn seems to have been\nborn to play. It\u2019s exciting seeing\nMendelsohn take centre-stage after\nyears of notable bit parts appearing\nin everything from The Dark Knight\nRises to Killing Them Softly. I\u2019ve\nbeen waiting for him to have this\nmuch screen time since his chilling\nturn as Uncle Pope in Aussie crime\ndrama Animal Kingdom, and he\ncertainly delivers. Gerry is a quiet,\nreserved, hopeless wreck of a man,\nthe kind you believe in when he\nlies to you, and curse when the\nobvious truth is revealed. Reynolds\nalso gives a strong performance as\nCurtis, who proves to be the perfect\nfoil for Gerry. The interaction of\nthese two painfully lonely men,each\nfor their own reasons, is where the\nheartbreaking centre of the drama\nlies.\nWhat the film does less well is\nwalk the line between moral drama\nand emotional torture. Watching\nthe characters sink further and\nfurther into depravity, poverty, and\ndesperation is at times a painfully\npoignant watch, but at others just\na painful one. Each cocky bet, each\nfailed hand, each petty attempt at\ntheft becomes another kick in the\ngut from these men you thought you\nwanted to spend some time with,\nand the film begins to feel rather\nlike a dirge. While perhaps similar\nthings can be said of Half Nelson,\nthat film keeps its viewers\u2019 interest\nwith gripping subject matter told\nwith a streak of genuine passion and\ndesire for redemption. However,\nin this film you begin to wonder\nwhether any such redemption will\narrive at all. Ultimately Mississippi\nGrind never manages to combine\na grand narrative sweep with an\nintimate character study the way\nHalf Nelson did and, as a result, it\nremains not too much more than an\nintimate character study. But, with\ngorgeous handheld cinematography,\nstrong writing and two excellent\nperformances, it\u2019s a pretty damn\ngood one.\nTOM STEPHENS\n\n"

    "content": "PAGE 5\nfelixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 30th\nOCTOBER 2015\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy are Imperial students so apathetic\nabout politics?\nIt is time that we acknowledged our failure to act,\nfind a cause, and make a difference\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nWe can make signs too! Photo Credit: Grace Rahman\nT\nhe students of Imperial\nare, in my experience,\ngreatly lacking in their\nenthusiasm for political\nand social issues when compared\nto their contemporaries at other\ninstitutions. While it might be true\nthat there is growing resentment\nand disillusionment among students\ntowards the political class, this does\nnot excuse the alarming lack of\nvisible activism and demonstration\nacross campus.\nThis might seem strange for\na university that prides itself in\nhaving the largest election turnout\nin England & Wales, but it is the\nlogical conclusion for a student\npopulation that is more interested in\nbecoming part of the establishment\nthan making the world a better\nplace.\nSustaining pressure on the\ngovernment and other bodies\n(including college) is incredibly\nimportant. Our involvement and\nengagement in politics must extend\nbeyond voting in general and local\nelections. We vote politicians into\npower, and rely on leaders who\ncontinually break their promises. In\nthe past, we have seen that students\nare often the most vulnerable to\nsuch shameless reversals of policy,\nand yet now we are almost silent.\nHave we been so demoralised by\nthe failure of students in the past to\novercome an increase in tuition fees\nthat we have given up? Thousands\nare still fighting back at universities\nacross the country, so why aren\u2019t\nwe among them? Imperial and its\nstudents live in a bubble.\nIt would be unfair not to highlight\nthe good work that many students\ncontribute to through the student\nunion and its many societies.\nHuge amounts of volunteering and\nfundraising take place throughout\nthe year, and last year alone students\nmanaged raise over \u00a3100,000 for\ncharity. To be fully effective, this\nneedstobedonealongsideconcerted\nefforts to lobby government or other\nappropriate institutions. Changing\npolicy is the ultimate solution;\nanything else merely solves the\nproblem in the short term.\nWhile the Union must remain\nnon-partisan, it will campaign on\nissues that are brought forward to\nUnion Council. A list of the policies\nthat have passed Council is available\nonline and some of these are very\nprogressive, but in the past, very few\nhave been publicised to the extent\nnecessary to encourage student\nparticipation in these specific causes.\nThere is obviously some appetite\nfor mass protest at Imperial and we\nhave seen this in the recent action\nagainst the proposed changes to\njunior doctor contracts.This passion\nneeds to continue and spread to\nother causes, ones which not only\naffect us as students, but also those\nwhich affect the weakest in society.\nThere are members of our elected\nunion who do care enough to get\ninvolved in political action. The\nDeputy President of Welfare and\nthis year\u2019s Campaigns Officer\nare both attending the upcoming\nNational Campaign Against Fees\nand Cuts demonstration on the 4th\nof November. Similarly, our Union\nPresident is an avid elephant activist\nand I hope she can extend this\nenthusiasm to the thousands of\nstudents she represents. If the leader\nof the Labour party can take time\nout to show solidarity with student\nactivists surely our president can\ntoo.\nThe Union\u2019s communication is\nultimately its downfall;with so many\npassionate students representing us,\nit\u2019s a shame that their voices are\nnever loud enough. While the NUS\nmay be a controversial institution,\ntheir promotion and defence of the\nrights of students is often heard on\na national level.\nWhy is it that our students are\nless interested in bottom-up politics\nthan those at other universities? It\nis possible that the multiple failed\ncampaigns of the Union in the\npast, including their failure to stop\nthe closure of Weeks and Garden\nHalls, have fostered a sense of\npowerlessness among students. Of\ncourse, in most of these cases it\u2019s\nthe College which is completely at\nfault, but, our union could do more\nto become a dissenting voice.\nGeneral apathy could also be\nas a result of the large percentage\nof foreign students studying at\nImperial. I would be afraid of\nprotesting in a country that wasn\u2019t\nmy own, but when the government\nis attempting to place counterThere\u2019s no\nbetter time\nthan at\nuniversity to\nmake your\nvoice heard\nintuitive restrictions on foreign\nstudents, they must stand with us.\nHowever,there are other universities\nwhere a similarly large proportion\nof the student population is from\nabroad and some of these are well\nknown for their activism.\nAs a university specialising in\nscience and technology, students are\nmore familiar working with fact and\nanalysis than they are with opinions.\nIt seems as if most students are just\ncoming to Imperial in the hope that\nthey will one day work for the banks\nand large corporations that are the\ncause all of our problems. They\nwould rather join the powerful than\nwork on the side of the exploited.\nWhen a very large amount of\nopportunities that are available to\nstudents are at companies with no\ndiscernible benefit to society, it is\neasy to understand why so few of\nus at Imperial are willing to stand\nup to injustice. The College and\ncareers services should do more\nto attract companies that have a\npositive impact on the world, and\nthey should encourage students to\ncreate startups that actually solve\nreal problems, rather than build\ncompanies around interesting\ntechnological advancements. Only\nwhen students start to see others\naround them contributing are they\nlikely to want to help.\nFor me, this is the very first step\nin acknowledging my own failure\nto act. It\u2019s time for you and I to get\ninvolved. This is my impassioned\ncall to arms: protest, occupy and\novercome the insurmountable. Find\na cause and make a difference; there\nis no better time than at university\nto make your voice heard.\nThey would\nrather\njoin the\npowerful\nthan work\non the\nside of the\nexploited\n\n"

With the team\nin a transitional phase and many\nnew players signing up to take on\nthe sport, priority was given to\nbeginners and first-time players to\nbuild up some game experience.\nThe tournament, which took place\nat the Score Centre in Leyton,\nThe Imperial team showed encouraging signs during their final two games. Photo Credit: Imperial Eagles\nwas played in a round-robin\nformat where all five teams played\nagainst one another in a series of\n15-minute matches. No time-outs\nwere allowed and the two-minute\nsuspension penalties were reduced\nto one minute. The teams that\nfinished first and second in the\ntable then contested the final. In\nthe women\u2019s competition only two\nteams participated playing a full-length one-hour match.\nThe Imperial men\u2019s team was\nrepresented by Jakub Szypicyn,\nHoria-DanielTigau,Theo Franquet,\nPatrik Gubeljak, Mohamed\nKoronfel, Benedikt Explicat,\nClement Escolano, Kamil Kurdziel,\nJay Heinen, Alexandr Kirilinko,\nLangston Williams, Samuel Rot\nand Giovanni Bettinelli. First up\nwas a Brunel team that arrived short\non players.The Eagles trio of Kamil,\nJay and Langston joined the Brunel\nside and were responsible for more\nthan half of the goals in the 5-3\ndefeat of the Eagles.\nThe next game was against a vastly\nexperienced UCL side that had a\nlot of familiar faces from previous\nseasons. UCL have been the Eagles\u2019\nmain challenge in the past but\nwith their team vastly unchanged\nthis year, this was a chance for\nEagles have slow start to the season\nImperial\u2019s handball team started with four defeats, but were able to provide beginners\nwith their first experience in the sport\nour fresh side to gain experience\nagainst the toughest opposition in\nLondon.

The final score was\n4-10, a heavy defeat but a valuable\nexperience for all involved.\nMohamed Koronfel\nHandball Secretary\nAgainst KCL it was a more even\ngame and the Eagles took an early\nlead before a strong finish from KCL\ntested the fitness of the Eagles team\nas they succumbed to a third defeat\n4-6.With three defeats,any chances\nof playing the final diminished\nand the Eagles entered the final\ngame against Middlesex aiming to\nput some of what was learnt into\npractice. A similar scenario to that\nof the previous game unfolded with\nthe Eagles taking an early lead,\nforcing Middlesex to employ their\nstar man. Scoring four outstanding\ngoals on his own, he managed to\nlead Middlesex to a last gasp 5-4\nvictory.\nThe Eagles suffered four defeats\nbut signs of improvements were\nalready evident in the last two\ngames. It became clear that what\nthis year\u2019s fresh side needs the\nmost is a few more games together.\nHaving only managed two training\nsessions before this tournament, the\nEagles lacked cohesion in attack\nand communication in defence.\nThe women\u2019s game was a\nMiddlesex side \u2013 one of the best\nwomen\u2019s university teams in the\ncountry \u2013 facing a challenge from\na mixed-London universities team.\nThe mixed-team was represented\nby players from UCL (five), KCL\n(four) plus Imperial\u2019s Dominika\nKampa.\nThe game promised a lot on\npaper and lived up to expectations\nas it remained captivating until its\nfinal moments. The London team\ntook the lead early on and were\nalready 5-1 up after 20 minutes,\nwith Dominika playing a vital role\nin goal keeping the opposition\nat bay. Middlesex regrouped and\ntook advantage of some attacking\nmistakes by the London team, as\nthe lead was cut to one goal at 6-5\nat half-time. The London team\nstarted the second-half as strongly\nas they did in the first,taking a three\ngoal lead. However an incredible\nfinal 20-minutes performance by\nMiddlesex turned the game on\nits head. The team in white was\nunstoppable as they fought back\nand took the lead for the first time\nin the game, eventually winning the\ngame by 16-14.\nThis season is full of uncertainty\nbut with a few more sessions\ntogether, Imperial\u2019s Eagles could\nfind the team chemistry desperately\nneeded to lead this fresh side to\nsuccess.

This time\naround it didn\u2019t fail to provide\ndrama as the Imperial Immigrants\nhad many tough games but pushed\non through.\nThe first match of the day was\nagainst London rivals UCL. After\ntaking the lead with a run in the\nfirst UCL managed to get a few\nback due to some solid batting to\ntake a 4-1 lead but the Immigrants\nweren\u2019t going to let them run away\nwith it. In the top of the second\nImperial had scored three runs and\nhad the bases loaded with only one\nout when baseball veteran but newly\nImmigrated Luke Looney hit a long\nballpastcentrefieldforanimpressive\nGrand Slam, immediately ending\nthe inning on the mercy rule with\ntwo outs to spare. The game was far\nfrom over though as UCL were not\ngoing to go down without a fight,\nscoring another three runs in the net\ninning to bring the score to 8-7. It\nall came down to a nerve wrecking\nfinal inning and as the away team\nthe immigrants had to survive an\ninning without conceding. Easier\nsaid than done, especially when\nthere was the tying run on third;\nwinning at second,and only one out.\nOne strikeout later the pressure was\neased but only slightly.

During our\ntime there, we spent our time with\nchildren of all ages, learning about\nthe culture of Veliko Tarnovo and\nBulgaria, and exploring the sights\nthat they had to offer. Primarily, our\nrole was simply to spend time with\nthe children, and to enjoy the two\nweeks at the orphanage.\nWe were greeted with outstanding\neagerness by the orphans, who\nhave had previous experience with\nvolunteers such as ourselves, and\nwere ready to play the moment\nwe arrived. The majority of the\nchildren preferred to play outside\nin the garden, choosing from a\nvariety of swings, trampolines and\nclimbing frames. Not once did the\nenergetic demands of the kids cease\nduring our time there; they were\nalways keen on having us carry\nthem around on piggyback, or play\nfootball, or even being used as rope\nto play tug of war with. Such an\nexhaustive workload was satiated\nonly by a series of afternoon naps,\nwhich provided a small glimmer\nof peace, before we returned to the\nrelentless spirit of the kids.\nThroughout the course of this\nexperience, we found that we were\noften alone in looking after the kids;\na lack of enthusiasm for supervision\nwas reflected in the attitudes of\nmost of the staff. This was seen\nwhen the excitement of the children\nturned into a brutal combination of\nhair-pulling, stone-throwing and\npunching. Nonetheless, the orphans\nshowed us an extraordinarily\nvivid ensemble of personalities.\nEveryone had their own unique\ninterests and aspirations; some\nsaw themselves as rappers, others\nas footballers, and even a few as\ndoctors. The orphanage was host to\nan atmosphere of closeness between\nthe children, who shared food and\nclothes with each other every day.\nWe encountered an amazing level\nof creativity, expressed through a\nvariety of means, including making\nflowers with beads and being rapped\nat in Bulgarian.\nOn our days off, we explored the\nmany sights of Veliko Tarnovo, of\nwhich the most significant were\nthe medieval Tsarevets fortress and\nthe monument of Assens. In our\nattempts to find the latter, we found\nourselves unable to effectively use\na map, regardless of the collective\ngeographical qualifications of the\ngroup. Having explored for what\nfelt like days, we somehow, through\nwhat was undoubtedly a miracle,\neventually found our way to the\nmonument, a dedication to the\nreign of 3 Bulgarian Kings under\nwhom the medieval Bulgarian\nstate reached its pinnacle.

When you feel\na bit down it is tempting to write off\nany attempts you make if they\u2019re not\nimmediately perfect.\nDepression makes it hard to\nfind any motivation because you\u2019re\nconvinced nothing you do will be\ngood enough. Anxiety can make\nyou feel so worried that you won\u2019t\ndo well enough that you conclude\nyou should instead do nothing at\nall, because at least then you won\u2019t\nrun the risk of failing after having\nactually tried.\nI\u2019ve experienced all these feelings,\nand they create a cycle that makes it\nincredibly difficult to get out of.The\nmore deadlines that approach or the\nmore that you miss, the harder it\nis to think you should even bother\ntrying.\nBut, when you think about it\nlogically rather than emotionally,\njust attempting a problem sheet is\nbetter than nothing at all. It might\nnot be perfect, but at least you can\nget a score rather than nothing.\nMaking an attempt lets you start\nthe process of reaching out for help.\nDoing this depends on your\nindividual situation and can be\nanything from chatting to your\ntutor or peers to let them know\nyou\u2019re feeling off and might need\nsome extra help, to seeking out\ncounselling from the IC Health\nCentre or Student Service.Reaching\nout to let others help you is an\ninvaluable step to breaking a vicious\ncycle. However, there are also things\nyou can do to kick-start yourself on\nthe road to productivity.\nFirstly, recognising that\nsomething is better than nothing\nand scheduling your day accordingly\ncan work wonders. There are many\nways you can do this but assigning\ntasks to each day and being able\nto cross them off gives a sense of\naccomplishment that proves very\nmotivating.\nLooking up \u2018how to bullet journal\u2019\nonline throws up many resources\nshowing how you might make\none that works for you. Bullet\njournaling is a technique that can be\npersonalised, and centres typically\naround a tailored day planner.\nAnother timetabling resource\nI have found helpful in the past\nis an online system and app\ncalled HabitRPG. It allows you to\nessentially play a game where you\ngain money and stats within the\ngame by completed tasks you have\nassigned yourself in real life.\nWhen following the timings you\nhave given yourself remember not to\nwork yourself for too long or you\u2019ll\nlose concentration far too swiftly.\nA useful method is called \u2018The\nPomodoro Technique\u2019. This is a\nwhen you focus on working for\n25 minutes, then have a five-minute break. Repeat this cycle\nup to four times before you take a\nlong break of maybe half an hour.\nAgain, searching this online yields\na more detailed explanation of the\nprinciples behind it.\nDuring the 25 minute sessions\nof concentrated working, I find it\nuseful to use the Self-control app\nwhich allows you to ban yourself\nfrom certain websites for a specified\nlength of time.\nThere is also a browser addon called Simple Pomodoro that\nautomatically blocks sites for the\nrequired 25 minutes. It is a good\nway to prevent aimlessly wandering\naround on social media, or going\ndown into the deep dark depths\nof YouTube (which happens to me\nembarrassingly frequently).\nFinally, remembering to keep\nyour life well-balanced is a very\nimportant step to keeping yourself\nhappy and on-track, if not perfectly\nmotivated. Consider going for a\nshort walk during one of your study\nbreaks, and writing down and using\nsome self-care options or activities\nProcrastination vs. Productivity\nyou find relaxing to help you wind\ndown.\nAbove all, don\u2019t beat yourself up\nfor not managing to be perfectly\nproductive each day; some days you\njust need to congratulate yourself\nfor the small things. Getting out\nof bed, remembering to shower, or\nmaking yourself some warm food is\nan achievement in itself, especially\nwhen you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or\ndepression.\nSo keep it going, and use\neverything you can to help yourself\nget back on your feet.

Indeed, even as\na GCSE art student listening to my\nteacher trying to convince me that\nTracey Emin\u2019s unmade bed was a\nsupreme work of art worth writing\nabout, I wondered if there was any\nvalue in much of the enormous\nvolume of \u201cart\u201d that is produced\ntoday,each trying to outdo the other\nin originality.\nUntil recently, the arts have\ntypically been regarded as a luxury,\na kind of yardstick of one\u2019s wealth.\nOnly the rich and well-dressed can\nafford tickets to the opera; only the\nwealthy are able to acquire paintings\nfor their personal galleries. To\nmost people, art was thought to\nhave no immediate practical value\n(except perhaps in the time before\nphotography). What then, of the\nincreasingly abstract art that fills the\ngalleries today? Even as our galleries\nand stages present increasingly\ncontroversial and unorthodox works,\nthe drive to produce original pieces\nthat are as different as possible\nfrom what is already on display\nremains relentless. What was once\nregarded as \u201cfine art\u201d by virtue of\nthe fact that the influential enjoyed\nthem has been slowly taken over by\ncontemporary artworks that force us\nto constantly redefine \u201cart\u201d.\nYet, most of us seem to intuitively\nrecognise the inherent value of\nworks of art. In this country at\nleast, where one can view famous\npaintings regardless of wealth and\nprom for five quid classical concerts,\nthere is an importance placed on the\nappreciation of arts and culture that\nmakes society uniquely vibrant and\nfull of character.\nArt is a waste of time!\nIt\u2019s a bold claim, but is it actually true?\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nIndeed, it is this inextricable link\nbetween a society and its art that is\narguably the most practical reason\none can think of to support the\narts. It has always been an enduring\nmeans of expression for people of\nall nationalities and eras, forming\nan integral part of the richness of\nmany national and ethnic cultures.\nIt builds identity and serves as a\nrecord of time, people and places.\nTake something as monumental\nas the Berlin Wall for example. Its\ngraffiti served as an avenue for West\nGermans to vent their frustrations\nand freely express their opinions\nwhile those on the East were not\npermitted to go anywhere near \u2013\nvivid as a representation of the Cold\nWar.\nWhen we appreciate Ancient\nGreek pottery or the frescos in\nthe Sistine Chapel, their cultures\nlive on in our appreciation of their\nart. The consciousness of a people\nare crystallised in their artistic\nachievements and are passed on\nacross generations, kept alive by\nthe interest surrounding them.\nModern societies too recognise\nthe importance of art in shaping\nidentities \u2013 just look at the 2008\nBeijing Olympics. Clearly China\nsaw it as a grand opportunity to\nimpress a global audience and\nbolster its image as a fast-rising\nnation.\nMany of the pieces we have\nreviewed in the past few weeks\ninvolve art as social commentary \u2013\nwhether in Ai Weiwei\u2019s installations\nGraffiti on the West Berlin wall. Photo Credit: The Australian\nArt is\nnecessarily\na personal\nwork\nconjured\nfrom\npersonal\nexperiences\nand\nemotions\nMost of us\nseem to\nintuitively\nrecognise\nthe inherent\nvalue of art\nor the poetry by Exiled Writers\u2019 Ink.\nThe power of art in activism can\nperhaps be validated by the fact that\nthere is still so much censorship of\ncontroversial, politically incorrect\nThe ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Photo Credit: AFP\nart in many countries. Art is a\nvaluable avenue for public debate of\nimportant social issues and brings\nnew and revolutionary perspectives\nto the table, provoking diverse\ninterpretations and reactions and\nconstructive criticisms. Reading\nJohn Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of\nWrath makes the conditions of\nthe Great Depression far more\nvivid than any news report can\ngive. Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for\nGodot introduced Existentialism\nto the public in a way that Sartre\ncould never have achieved with his\nbook. Almost every newspaper has\na cartoon with something witty\nto say about the week\u2019s issues. By\ndecorating the message, it can\nsometimes be made more palatable,\nmore subtle, more poignant.\nArt clearly has a role to play in\nsociety. That is all well and good,\nbut what has all of the above got to\ndo with the individual? Of course,\nthere are musicals and plays and\ngigs that all of us enjoy, but there is\nalso a deep satisfaction in pondering\nart that is traditionally seen as more\n\u201cinaccessible\u201d, such as visual art.\nBesides making you a more refined\nand cultured individual (and giving\nyou more conversation fodder\nat parties), thinking about art\nprovides insight into worlds that we\nwould never be able to experience\nourselves. Because art is necessarily\na personal work conjured from\npersonal experiences and emotions,\nit is also a window to the way others\nsee the world, and that in itself adds\nrichness to our own experience.\nT\nhere is an amazing depth\nto what goes through\nyour head when you\u2019re\nlonely. The soundtrack to\nyour life, swarms of loving friends\naround you, the fragments of self-belief. It is so easy to believe that if\nonly you had the courage to speak up\nand confront the people in your life,\nthey\u2019d all understand your worries\nand see it your way. But the reality is\nmuch harsher, and the sweetness of\nthis dream state quickly turns bitter.\nOn the great American road trip,\nfollowing the godlike icons ofTeddy\nRoosevelt and Elvis, RoosevElvis\nportrays an emotionally honest and\npersonal view of loneliness and self-doubt in the American dream. The\nlatest creation by the Brooklyn based\nTEAM, Ann is drowning in her\ninsecurity. With the hallucinatory\nvisions of Elvis and Teddy fighting\nfor her soul, Ann meets Brenda.\nA free spirit whose easy approach\nto life challenges the monotony\nof Ann\u2019s world, Brenda is a true\ncharacter highlighting the truth of\nRoosevElvis atThe Royal Court\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nBrooklyn based ensemble bring their most intimate and touching work to London\nAnn\u2019s deeply depressing loneliness.\nA bittersweet and touching story,\nRoosevElvis is performed by the\nstellar double act of Libby King as\nAnn and Elvis, and Kristen Sieh\nas Brenda and the outrageous\nRoosevelt. The message is sad, but\nthere is an innate humour to the\nTEAM\u2019s work. The TEAM has\nembraced multimedia,and although\nI\u2019m not really a fan, it does give the Kristen Sieh (left) with the impressive Libby King Photo Credit: the TEAM\nLondon audience a deeply personal\ninsight into this classic American\nroad story. Nothing is done in\nhalf-measures, but they don\u2019t take\nthemselves too seriously.\nFor a large part of the show, I felt\nSieh\u2019s performance outshone the\nless impressive King, but by the\nend and especially in hindsight,\ntheir performances so beautifully\nreflected the personality conflict of\ntheir characters that I can\u2019t really\nfault them. A contrast between the\noutgoing arrogance of Teddy and a\nrestrained fear and self-doubt from\nAnn, RoosevElvis is emotionally\nchallenging, playful and at times\na wonderfully idyllic view of the\nAmerican dream in an oddly ironic\nsense.Reminding me of the fantastic\nLittle Miss Sunshine, RoosevElvis\nisn\u2019t the most exciting of stories but\nnice. It feels right and it feels real\nand I commend it for that.\nUntil 14th\nNovember at Royal Court\nEmotionally\nhonest and\npersonal\nCutting Comedy\u2019s Edge\nComedians face off against each other in a battle of funny at the Comedy Store\nE\nvery Tuesday evening\nthe Comedy Store plays\nhost to a topical comedy\nshow, drawing together a\nset of premium, not-so-well-known\nThe show started by introducing\neach of the comedians, first up\nwas Ian Stone, acting initially as\ncomp\u00e8re, he had a quirky and self\ndeprecating style. Ben Norris was\nnext up, delivering sharp but relaxed\njokes which tingled the audience\nto laughter. Then a bulldozer of a\ncomedian Jarred Christmas stormed\non stage with an angry yet hilarious\npersona, letting loose the f bomb at\nevery available opportunity. From\nover the pond Scott Capurro was\nnext on sharing with the audience\ndetailed stories of his eccentric gay\nlifestyle. Roger Monkhouse then\ntook to the stage engaging the\naudience with top quality banter.\nLast on was Rob Deering, bringing\nout his guitar and boyish charisma\nthat charmed the room to giggles.\nPeter Munton\nArts Writer\ncomedians. Just nestled down the\nroad from Piccadilly Circus on\nOxendon Street, this comedy club\nhauls in crowds after a day\u2019s work\n(or shopping) to fall victim to their\naudience preying comedians.\nRolling up with Imperial Comedy,\nI certainly felt safe in numbers and\nit was not long before the first\ncomedian picked out a particularly\ndrunk member of the audience\nto be the butt of numerous jokes.\nYou could literally hear every other\nperson on the front row breath out\na sigh of relief, it was not going to\nbe them.\nJarred Christmas looks very happy and very close. Too close. Photo Credit: Gazzette Live\nGreat for\na casual\nTuesday\nThe show then quickly proceeded\nto a series of topical games where\nmembers of the audience were given\nthe opportunity to provide topics\nfrom the past year and then from\nthe past week, for the comedians\nto perform with. Some of the\ncomedians managed brilliantly\nwith this improvisation, like Jarred\nChristmas, who entertained the\naudience enough to be voted as\nthe winner. Others obviously were\njust trying and struggling to relate\ngiven topics to previous stand up\nroutines that they had performed.\nSome others, such as Scott Capurro,\nwere dealt a tough hand and to the\ndelight of the audience flumped on\nstage, consequently being voted off.\nIf you enjoy seeing comedians\nbeing tortured on stage then this\nshow is definitely for you. However\nmuch of a bad time it looks like\nthey\u2019re having, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all\npart of the show. Such an engaging\nand interactive show is great for a\ncasual Tuesday evening.\nEvery Tuesday at 8pm in Picadilly\n\n"

I\u2019m not\njust talking a ticket to see the film,\nI mean full on red carpet walking\nboozing and schmoozing tickets.\nYou\u2019d have to be living under a\nrock to have missed the build up to\nthe premiere. Two days of rigging,\nroad closures all along Prince\nConsort Road and a handful of die\nhard Bond fans camping out to be\nin the crowd. As a jammy cow with\nan office right above the action and\na ticket to the main event I was\nasked to tell you all the mad things\nthat happened.\nLet\u2019s start with the cars and a\nshout out a particular crane operator.\nThis guy craned a Jaguar CX57\nand 007\u2019s DB10 through the gap\nbetween the Albert Hall and those\nposh flats to place them in front of\na massive expensive looking screen.\nThe guy deserves a medal,a clean set\nof underwear and a stiff drink.\nSecurity was pretty tight on the\nnight. En route back to office on\nMonday afternoon I had to fight\nthrough a massive queue of fans\nwaiting to get their bags thoroughly\nsearched before having to show my\nID card to what felt like a gazillion\nsecurity guards. Unlike with Union\nbar staff, I couldn\u2019t use \u2018my face is on\nthe screens\u2019 to get through.\nUnion staff found themselves\nhaving to clear meeting rooms in\nBeit of randoms all afternoon. This\nincludes one lady who apparently\nwould not quit and kept returning\nto her vantage point. Ironically,\nwhile I was on the red carpet half\nthe Union was hanging out of the\nsame windows.\nFinally we get to the main\nevent. Red carpet time. Dressed\nto the nines, I headed off with my\nembossed ticket to strut my ginger\nstuff. For those who care, I wore a\nteal silk dress made from a 1960\u2019s\nVogue pattern from my nan\u2019s back\ncupboards and vintage jewellery.\nObviously I was upstaged by Bond\nGirl Lea Seydoux.\nI spent my time on the red carpet\ntaking selfies, making the people\nwho queued for hours in the cold\nsick with envy and hoping to run\ninto the glorious Daniel Craig.I love\nan older man. The highlight of my\nred carpet experience came when I\nJennie Watson\nDeputy President of Welfare\nI spent my\ntime on the\nred carpet\ntaking\nselfies\nwas interviewed by ICTV. Those\nin the crowd were likely wondering\nwhat I ever did to be interviewed\non a red carpet. Big Brother season\n2? Guest appearance on TOWIE?\nICU Meet the Candidates? I\u2019m\npretty certain the security guy was\ntaking the piss with \u201cI hope you\nenjoyed your interview Madame\u201d.\nWho cares, I met Will.i.am at the\nbar 10 minutes later.\nI probably have to mention the\nroyals. Wills and Kate turned up,\nwith Harry third wheeling. They\ndidn\u2019t have to walk the red carpet\nlike the rest of us peasants, they\ndrove up. The entire audience then\nwatched them walking into the\nAlbert Hall on the screen.\nThe film is brilliant by the way.\nAs you can imagine Bond gets laid,\nsome cars get trashed and things\nblow up. You should go and see it.\nMonday nights will be crap for\nthe rest of my life.\nMeet the 007 megafans\nY\nou might\u2019ve thought\nskiving lectures on\nMonday to catch a\nglimpse of national\ntreasure Daniel Craig and a handful\nof royals as they attended the Spectre\npremiere was pretty cheeky. That\u2019s\nnothing compared to these fans,\nwho camped out on Prince Consort\nRoad for three days to secure a place\nright at the front of the crowds\nlining the red carpet.\nOn Saturday, 41 people signed up\nfor front row spots to see the film\u2019s\ncast, as well as Prince Harry, Prince\nWilliam and his wife, Kate, who\nattended the glamorous event.\nPeople with camping chairs and\nsleeping bags began to appear on\nSaturday, when they set up outside\nthe Holy Trinity Church on a\nclosed Prince Consort Road. The\nfirst arrival was an Ipswich couple in\ntheir 60s who grabbed the last train\nto London on Friday and arrived\nat 1am on Saturday morning. They\nalso claimed to be the first in line 3\nyears ago when Skyfall premiered at\nthe same venue.\nThe huge Bond fans said they\nhad watched all 23 Bond movies in\nthe build-up for tonight, until they\n\u201cwent blind\u201d.\nWhen asked why they had\nreturned for Spectre, the couple said\nthey had come very close to a selfie\nwith Daniel Craig last time and\nthat they would attempt it again on\nthis occasion. Another person joked\nthat he knows the films so well\nhe\u2019s starting to think he is Bond,\nalthough this FELIX reporter\nwould comment that his physique\nwas not a conventional one for the\npart.\nThe campers repeatedly called\nHigh Street Kensington\u2019s 24-hour\nMcDonald\u2019s a \u201clife saver\u201d. The\nharsh sleeping conditions of an\nuncovered London road in the cold\nwere ridiculed by one camper, who\nclaimed he was \u201chardcore\u201d enough\nto survive Saturday\u2019s rain and 2\u00b0C\nnight temperature, although he did\ncomplainthathissleepwasdisturbed\nby rowdy Imperial students leaving\nthe Oktoberfest celebrations at the\nunion on Saturday night.\nThe uber fans boasted of having\nseen Bond\u2019s Aston Martin DB10,\nstar of the trailer\u2019s car chase in\nRome, get delivered to the Royal\nAlbert Hall beforehand.\nThe keenest campers, who were at\nthe front of the red carpet,expressed\nfears of being shaken and stirred\nby the crowds expected, but when\nasked why they have gone to so\nmuch trouble for a glimpse of an\nactor, one said, \u201cWell it\u2019s Bond. It\ndoesn\u2019t get bigger than that,does it?\u201d\nPhilip Kurukgy\nWriter\nThey\nrepeatedly\ncalled the\n24 hours\nMcDonalds\na \u201clife\nsaver\u201d\nThey were camping on Prince\nConsort Road for two days\nICTV meetTop Gear host\nI\nCTV\u2019s Jonathon Masters and\nHasan Al-Habib managed to\nwangle a YouTube gem at the\nSpectre premiere: an interview\nwith Chris Evans.\nAfter being flagged down by\nImperial College TV at the end of\nthe red carpet, Evans paused to talk\nto the roving reporters.\nHe was handed a microphone by\nthe rookies, which wasn\u2019t plugged\ninto anything, muttering \u201cthis is\nhilarious\u201d before telling the boys he\nwas excited to be joining Top Gear,\nbut was more excited about their\nmicrophone.\nEvans asked the boys if they\u2019d\napplied to be a host of the new\nshow, with Al-Habib responding\nthat he was \u201ctempted by Amazon\nPrime\u201d, the company set to run a\nshow with the original Clarkson/\nMay/Hammond cast.\nChris then, cursing his own\ninterviewing technique, gestured\nfor the camera. Masters obliged\nwithout hesitation, and Chris began\nto film the two.\nTaking off his own glasses, he\nshoved them to Masters, a similarly\nfirey redhead.\nFilming himself and the ICTV\nduo, he exclaimed, \u201cthis is the real\nChris Evans interview!\u201d\nReferring to strawberry blonde\nMasters, he pleased the crowd,\nquipping,\u201cthat\u2019s what I used to look\nlike!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so jealous of his hair, it\u2019s\nproper ginger hair, mine\u2019s rubbish.\u201d\nEvans was without his glasses after ICTV got hold of him.

This, reiterated by\nProfessor Nutt numerous times\nlast Tuesday, was the start of drug\nlaws as a political tool and allowed\ndecisions to be made by those\nwith no understanding of scientific\nevidence.\nOne of the arguments frequently\nvoiced in the defence of drug laws,\nis that illicit drug use leads the user\ndown a path of mental disorders and\ncrime.In fact,this \u2018crime\u2019committed\nby the inebriated costs our police\nforce \u00a37 billion a year. However, it\nis not MDMA (which has virtually\nno evidence of causing social harm)\nor cocaine, which influences these\n\u2018criminals\u2019. It is, sadly, alcohol.\nProfessor Nutt\u2019s Independent\nScientific Committee on Drugs\npublished a report demonstrating\nalcohol as the overall most harmful\ndrug in existence. Heroin came in\nsecond and crack cocaine third. He\nelaborated by disclosing that 80%\nof alcoholics have other mental\ndisorders and 40% of suicides are\ncommitted thanks to drink every\nyear.\nEvidence depicts drugs as a safer\noption than alcohol, a legal and\nunregulated substance, and since\nthree young people die of alcohol\npoisoning a week, drug laws cannot\nbe based on science. Drug policy is\nbased on use. Professor Nutt\u2019s blog\nDrug Science calls for \u2018evidence not\nexaggeration\u2019, and is careful to stress\nthat all drug use carries a risk.\nHowever, deaths go up when\nthe market is forced underground.\nIn 1971 Britain had 1000 heroin\naddicts. The aftermath of the\nMisuse of Drugs Act now sees the\nNHS battling over 200,000 cases\nof addiction. It is now illegal to\nprescribe heroin; users are forced to\nget their fix in other ways such as by\nselling to others, which only serves\nGabriella Beer\nWriter\nDavid is Nutts about drugs\nProfessor David Nutt invites us to all get on our high horse and discuss failings of the\ncurrent drug legislations\nHorse riding\nis more\ndangerous\nthan illicit\ndrug use\nA man who likes to break the mould. Photo Credit: Imperial College London\nEvidence\ndepicts\ndrugs as a\nsafer option\nto alcohol,\na legal\nand\nunregulated\nsubstance\n2015\u2019 passed its second reading this\nOctober and sets out to ban the\nsale of any psychoactive substance,\nregardless of harms and benefits.\nProfessor Nutt stressed that this law\nwillpreventanyfurtherinvestigation\ninto safer alternatives to alcohol\nand will impede the development\nof other psychoactive substances to\ntreat common mental disorders such\nas schizophrenia. The definition of\n\u2018psychoactive drugs\u2019 is loose. Does\nthis also relate to antipsychotic\ndrugs or antidepressants? Professor\nNutt\u2019s team is currently embarking\non the UK\u2019s first clinical trial\nusing the psychedelic ingredient\nin magic mushrooms, psilocybin,\nto treat clinical depression. To\nhis exasperation, government\nregulations controlling the licensing\nof illegal drugs in research and EU\nguidelines have stalled the start of\nthe trial. The Professor is urging\nthem to rethink regulations. Not all\npsychoactive drugs are recreational\nand certainly not all are harmful;\nsome, he argues, have clear benefits\nand the potential to revolutionise\nmental health research.\nThe final and perhaps most\ninteresting question put to\nProfessor Nutt last Tuesday evening\nwas, \u2018if you were Home Secretary,\nGovernments too anal when it comes to setting drug legeslation laws. Photo\nCredit: Wikipedia\nwhat would be your drugs policy?\u2019\nUnsurprisingly, his answer was\nunambiguous and rational.\nTo paraphrase the Chair of the\nIndependent Scientific Committee\non Drugs and the Vice-President of\ntheEuropeanBrainCouncil:alcohol\nshould be made the threshold for\npolicy. Everything classed below as\nless harmful, including MDMA,\ncannabis and ecstasy, should be\nregulated and licensed. It is only\nthen that you can address the issue\nof alcohol abuse and bring the fifth\nmost dangerous drug in the world\nunder the same control.\nNevertheless, the Professor ended\nhis talk with a harrowing message \u2013\ndrug misconduct is politically useful\nand scientific evidence does not\nseem to fit into political campaigns.\nDespite the evidence that\ncriminalising those who take drugs\nwill destroy more lives than taking\nthem, politicians are determined\nto make decisions that perceive\nthe elected as taking control of an\nextremely volatile national concern.\nHe concluded that drug laws are\nbased on a hatred for those who like\nto do things differently \u2013 and this\n90-minute lecture certainly told us\nthat Professor David Nutt likes to\ndo things differently.\nto escalate the problem. Rightly so,\nthe Professor calls for a rethink in\ngovernment attitude to this disease.\nThe \u2018Psychoactive Substances Bill\n\n"

The\nmatch ran with Imperial College\ndominating from the start, with\nbig collisions recurrent within the\nopening encounters. This resulted\nin Imperial going ahead early from\na penalty, slotted majestically and\nsomewhat surprisingly by Charles\nPrice-Smith. With Imperial\ncamped out on the Medway line,\nClub Captain and number 10 for\nthe day, Charles Price-Smith, fired\na dubious double-miss pass out to\nthe towering wing, Josh O\u2019Donnell,\nallowing him to dot down for the\nopening try of the match.\nImperial consistently capitalised\non Medway indiscipline at the break\ndown, taking field position and\nutilising the customary strong line-out plays to inevitably construct a\nmall on the opposition line, quickly\ndriving over twice in succession,\nwith both trys being scored by\nnumber 8, and the humble author\nof this report,Tom Hedley.\nPlay then broke up with Chris\nMacBeth threatening the Medway\ndefence. Captain Dave NielsenScott carried well before being\nswiftly inverted by the opposition\nand mixed like the human martini\nthat he is. Luckily for Imperial\nthe captain appeared to have been\nstirred rather than shaken by the\nexperience, going on to carry the\nball 50 meters later in the game\nonly for the ball to die a death in\nthe hands of Carlos Sheppard.\nIn the second-half Imperial\nfell foul to a string of penalties,\nresulting in the illustrious Honorary\nSecretary Tom Hobson receiving\nhis first ever yellow card. He took\nthe compulsory 700 push-ups fine\nimposed by our more old-fashioned\nSouth African coach in good spirit,\nand his pectorals will thank him for\nit eventually.\nEd Durkin proceeded to take hold\nof the game using his tactical kicking\nto put his team in all the right\nplaces, taking a black eye at some\npoint in the process, which he later\nused to impress his girlfriend, so the\nrumours say, with stories of heroics.\nCapitalising on this, Tom Hedley\n(deserved man-of-the-match and\nquite frankly playing in a league far\nbelow his ability) scored two tries in\nquick succession. One from broken\nplay handing off the fullback, and\nthe other acting as the beneficiary\nat the end of a well-worked backs\nmove, with the winger trusting in\nHedley\u2019s deceptive footwork over\nhis own. This brought his try total\nfor the game to a staggeringly\nimpressive four tries. Four.\nThanks to a united front row of\nNathan Tomlinson \u2013 who will be\ndelighted to tell you that his heart-rate is so low because he is \u2018so fit\u2019\n(his doctor will corroborate it, he\npromises) \u2013 Tom Hobson and Jon\nLineham; Imperial\u2019s dominance at\nscrum time allowed them to work\nan 8, 9, 15 wing move, culminating\nwith Josh O\u2019Donnell going in to\nscore his second in the corner.\nImperial withstood the weakened\nattacks of Medway in the closing\nminutes, holding on to their clean\nsheet and securing the first of what\nis sure to be many wins in the season\nto come.\nRugby 1st XV start with thumping win\nTom Hedley\nRugby Promotions\nBut fail to make it two out of two\nA\nfter a convincing 37-0\nwin at home to Medway\ntwo weeks ago, the first\nteam of ICURFC were\nconfident going into what was going\nto be one of the toughest games of\nthe season, safe in the knowledge\nthat they came equipped with the\nonly Scholarship Athlete for rugby\nin the history of scholarships at\nImperial, and the humble author\nof this report, Joe McGrail. After\na long two hour journey and some\nhandy minibus manoeuvres from\nO\u2019Donnell, Imperial were left with\nonly a short period of time to warm\nup before the game was underway.\nThe conditions were poor and\nfrom the off both teams were\nmaking numerous unforced errors,\nfailing to string together any phases.\nThis appeared to be the general\ntheme throughout what was a very\nsloppy game. Canterbury adapted\nmore quickly to the conditions and\nbegan to play a very tight game\ntrying to keep the ball in hand.\nImperial\u2019s defence stood strong, and\nby defence we mean the chop tackles\nthat literally brought Canterbury to\ntheir knees demonstrating that the\nrugby scholarship was well earned.\nHowever, a lapse in concentration\nsawmissedtacklesastheCanterbury\noutside centre broke the line and\nwent on to score the only try of the\ngame.

Also a mention to fullback\nAlex Hawkings and scrum-half Ed\nDurkin who showed good attacking\nintent and giving imperial some go\nforward from running back kick\nreturns and playing some clever\nchips through respectively.\nThis weekend will be put behind\nus and the players made it quite\nclear that there will not be a repeat\nof this performance in the season\nto come.

Although it hosts similar\ngatherings across the Midlands,\nScotland,and Ireland,the jewel in its\ncrown has always been the biannual\nLondon MCM ComicCon. The\nevent attracts more than 120,000\nvisitors over the weekend, making\nit one the biggest gatherings of its\nkind in Europe.\nPeople from\nall over are\nwelcomed\ninto the\ncommunity Peter Zhang takes a break from studying Medicine at Imperial to strike a pose in his \u2018Edge of Tomorrow\u2019 suit.

Photo Credit: Dwarf Trash\nIt\u2019s sheer\nmadness, but\ndelightful.\ndown the country, but I have a soft\nspot for MCM because of the huge\nvariety of stuff that\u2019s on offer across\ngenres and media. It\u2019s not every\nday you get to see promo material\nfor the release of the latest Persona\ngame or Assassins\u2019 Creed coexisting\nin the same hall, alongside a pewter\ncast of Han Solo in carbonite or\na panel with Rooster Teeth (of\nRWBY and Red vs Blue fame).\nYou\u2019ve got amateur and semiprofessional artists peddling their\nwares on one end, big name stalls\non the other end, and a chance to\ntake photos with The Walking Dead\nMalaysia, which had oodles on\noffer; the MCM cons, however, are\nanother beast altogether. I\u2019ve gone\nfrom someone who first started\ncasually dressing up as hipster Ariel\nlast Halloween to doing a full-blown live-action game cosplay\nthis October. This year I saw an\nAltair (Assassins\u2019 Creed) cosplayer\nplay dead on the floor after yelling\nout \u201cDESYNCHRONIZED!\u201d,\nand a Deadpool cosplayer yelling\nfor \u201cTodd (Haberkorn)-senpai\u201d to\nnotice him whilst pretending to cut\na meet and greet queue. It\u2019s sheer\nmadness, but delightful.\nT\nhe first time I attended\nMCM London was\nthe summer convention\nin May this year. I was\nimmediately struck at the vibrancy,\nthe buzz, and above all, how\nincredibly happy and overwhelmed\nI was by the sheer number of people\nthat had also decided to join me,and\nhow these events bring us together.\nThere are all sorts of cons all year\nround in London, let alone up and\nzombies or in the Back To The\nFuture DeLorean machine in yet\nanother corner of the hall.\nIt\u2019s also amazing how many con\nvirgins later on end up becoming\navid cosplayers as a result. My\nfirst ever comic con was back in\nin the two-hour queue outside\nthe London ExCeL building at\n9am waiting to be the first in to\nsee their favourite celebrity. Even\nthis doesn\u2019t take into account the\nsocial integration of people from\nextremely diverse backgrounds,\ndrawn from across the world by their\nmutual love of art and design. The\nvisual communication of comics\nand costumes permeates language\nbarriers. People are unilaterally\nwelcomed into the community.\nEven to a mainstream media lover,\nthe appeal is clear. Daniel Radcliffe\nwas one of the celebrities making an\nappearance this time last year, while\nStephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss\nof Sherlock and Doctor Who hosted\na writer\u2019s panel. Members of the\npublic rushed to take photographs\nwith representatives from The\nWalking Dead and Game of Thrones.\nFor someone with an open mind\ntowards art, the convention\u2019s Comic\nVillage is an area specifically\ndedicated to professional artists,\npublishers, and designers. Works\ndisplayed this year ranged from\nOne Piece, a popular fantasy pirate\nmanga, with accompanying anime\nseriesandfeaturefilms;tomoreniche\nindependentworksandadultcomics.\nThe existence of platforms\nlike ComicCon adds a well-received splash of creativity to\nLondon. It is not only of great\nbenefit to the local community,\nbut is a social achievement to be\ncelebrated, serving as inspiration to\ndesigners, creators, and the people\neverywhere who enjoy their work.\nFor those of us who have grown\nup after the developments of the\ninformation age, it is inconceivable\nthat enthusiasts once had to make\nlong trips to the only city in the\ncountry which had the shop\nhosting the designs or collections\nthey wanted. And consider the\nvideo game industry, designers and\nartists, and film stars and celebrities,\nwho also benefit from this strange\nkind of global integration. The vast\neconomic benefit is indisputably\nclear \u2013 especially to anyone stuck\nGeek culture\u2019s sudden explosion in\npopularity has not gone unnoticed in\nindustry. From 2002 to 2013, profits\nfrom the distribution of Japanese\nanimation alone increased from\n\u00a50.2bn to \u00a534bn. Each individual\nconvention is an opportunity for\ndevelopers and designers from\nall over the world to have their\nwork celebrated. Moreover, these\nevents are emotionally charged,\nwith visitors often spending\nmonths designing costumes\nsolely for the sake of a weekend.\n\n"
