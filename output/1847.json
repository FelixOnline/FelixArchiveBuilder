Just like that, we have\ncome to the final term of this academic year! For many of you, as for me, that\nmeans the dreaded exam season is upon\nus. As much as that can feel like wading\nthrough a swamp of notes, past papers,\nand all-nighters, we shall of course soon\nemerge victorious, if a little exhausted,\non the soft banks of summer. At any rate,\nI hope that we, the Felix Puzzles team, can\nmake that journey feel a little less ardu-ous, naturally through the medium of\nbrain-teasers.\nI would like to address a concern about\nthe difficulty of the sudoku puzzles that\nhas been brought to my attention by a few\nreaders.Namely,thatthey'retooblummin'\neasy! One particularly passionate puzzler remarked that to label the previous\nissue's sudoku as extra hard was 'almost\na humiliation' and that the puzzle was\n'easily solvable by seventh-grade young-lings.'

Our front-page splash\nis the closure of Slug, the beloved\nFulham pub/club that became iconic\nfor its Wednesday student nights.\nIn reporting the story, we were surprised to learn that the venue has air\nconditioning \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t know it\nfrom spending a night out there.\nSlug nights were sticky, sweaty,\nmessy affairs that played out to a\nstrange soundtrack of country mu-sic, \u201980s classics and cheesy 2000s\npop (think \u201cCotton Eye Joe\u201d, \u201cLivin\u2019\non a Prayer\u201d and \u201cDJ Got Us Fallin\u2019 in\nLove\u201d\n.)\nIt\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but\nit was certainly appealing enough to\nthe dozens of Imperial students and\nsports teams that would pack out the\nvenue every Wednesday. At its bus-iest, there was barely enough room\nto stand, and students would readily\nqueue outside for hours simply to be\ntold at midnight to go home.\nFor the Slugoholics among you,\nall is not lost; Felix has found that\nthe pub might have a new proprietor\nsoon, and we\u2019ll keep you updated as\nwe learn more.\nThe bigger long-term story this\nweek, however, is that prominent scientists have added their voices to a\nchorus of students, staff, and alumni\ncalling on Imperial to divest from fossil fuel companies.\nImperial\u2019s endowment \u2013 its investment portfolio \u2013 does not include any\nsuch companies at present. But what\nthe activists are seeking is a change\nin policy; they want the College to\nstate explicitly that it will not invest in\nany fossil fuel companies from now\nonwards.\nIt seems that such a move is quite\npossible; certainly, the direction of\ntravel indicates a policy change.\nImperial\u2019s current stance was first\nestablished in 2020, by the Socially\nResponsible Investment (SRI) Policy Working Group. They drew on\nthe testimony of students, staff, and\nexternal experts \u2013 ranging from stu-dent-run activist group Divest Imperial to Shell\u2019s Head of Reputation\nManagement.\nThe result was the SRI Policy, committing that Imperial would \u2018continue\nto invest in fossil fuel companies that\ndemonstrate they are actively moving\ntowards meeting Paris Agreement\ntargets.\u2019\nIt was a win for Imperial and for\nagitators. The College could satiate\nstudent activists without alienating\nimportant funders of research. Those\nsame activists could also claim a\nmilestone victory; they had made a\nreal difference.\nBut for Imperial Climate Action\n(ICA), which took on the mantle from\nDivest Imperial, only full divestment\nfrom all fossil fuel companies would\nsuffice.\nAt the beginning of this academic year, our editorial (Issue #1829)\nnoted that ICA had an ally in Union\nPresident Camille Boutrolle. And this,\ncombined with an increasingly vocal\nseries of campaigns from ICA, appears to be making a difference.\nImperial announced in February\nthat it will determine its engagement\nwith energy companies using its Imperial Zero Index.\nThe College has said that student\nrepresentatives will be involved in the\nprocess, which will evaluate partners\nagainst a set of key criteria.\nThe index has been rubbished by\nICA, which says that anything short\nof divestment is insufficient, given\nthat \u2018decades of investor engagement\nefforts have failed to transition these\ncompanies away from their core oil,\ncoal and gas business models\u2019\n.\nNevertheless, it represents another incremental step towards the position of activists.\nOnly a few years ago, divestment\nseemed a million miles away.\nBut today, on 10th\nMay 2024, the\nSRI Working Group will reconvene \u2013\nfor the first time since 2020 \u2013 to discuss that very topic.\nAnd now, we wait...\nLetter to the Editor: College spent half a million\npounds on \u2018brand refresh\u2019 and logo\nHello,\nInteresting to read about the cost of the latest branding\nexercise [this issue, page 5]. I wonder who said that the\n\u201cOur full institutional name \u2013 Imperial College London\u201d\nremains.\nThe full institutional name is \u201cImperial College of\nScience, Technology and Medicine\" as on the royal charter\n\u201cImperial College London\u201d is a conceit dating from the\nequally controversial and expensive branding exercise of\naround 2002.\nBest wishes,\nNick\nAlumnus\nSelina Ye\n\n"

Only one motion was presented \u2013 \u201cJust and sustainable plant-based catering\nat Student Union outlets to tackle the climate crisis\u201d\nby grassroots campaigners from Plant-based Universities (PBU). The vote was close, with the result being 11\nfor, 13 against, and 2 abstentions.\nThe motion would commit the Student Union to\nsupporting and lobbying for plant-based catering\nacross Imperial. It also asked the Union to transition\ncatering to 100% plant-based, although it did not set\na timeline. PBU Imperial hopes that this would encourage people to eat more plant-based food. The\ncampaigners accepted the two amendments proposed\nduring the discussion, which helped place fewer restrictions on the process of the transition for the Union and encourage locally sourced food.\nWell over a dozen questions were taken on the\nmotion and the campaigners plan to respond to each\npoint ahead of submitting a revised motion in June. A\nthreshold of 50% + 1 is needed to accept motions (with\nthe chair breaking ties), so the campaigners need to\nflip one councillor by the meeting at the end of term.\nMany people eat what they think tastes best without considering the environmental or ethical conse-quences. This was reflected by councillors who wanted to ensure that meat-eating students would like the\nplant-based options as much as meat. They asked for\nmore evidence showing enthusiasm from students\nfor plant-based options and more evidence that the\noptions could be healthy and tasty. Councillors also\nhad concerns about land use, prices, and whether they\ncould represent students on the motion. If the motion\nis passed, students wishing to eat meat on campus\ncould still bring in their own food \u2013 like many people\nwith allergies and dietary restrictions already have to.\n\u201cLosing by only two votes shows that what we\u2019re\nasking for isn\u2019t a wildly unpopular idea, so I\u2019m feeling\npositive,\u201dsaidHollieMeyers,leadcampaignerofPlantBased Universities Imperial. \u201cDuring the meeting, I\nwelcomed concerns over the logistics about the move\nto 100% plant-based, but the relentless comments\nabout whether plant-based diets are actually healthy\nannoyed me. I want to emphasise that we\u2019re asking\nfor systemic over individual change, so I\u2019m hoping\nthat people\u2019s own barriers to eating plant-based diets\nare left aside and to agree that a radical change in our\nuniversity catering system is needed to save our dying\nplanet.\u201d\nThe Union almost committed to\nplant-based catering, but why is this\nnecessary?\nGlobal warming requires urgent action. According to\na Nature paper last month, we are likely already committed to a 19% income reduction worldwide by 2050.\nThis is alongside climate change potentially displacing billions and being a threat multiplier. Food systems make up a between one-quarter and one-third of\nglobal emissions. Just continuing to eat as usual would\nuse up our entire carbon budget for limiting global\nwarming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures,\nand 75% of our budget for 2\u00b0C.\nPlant-based food wouldn\u2019t just help us decarbonise.\nIt would free up land \u2013 the same area as China, Europe, and the United States combined \u2013 currently used\nto grow crops to feed animals. The land we would no\nlonger use could be rewilded to help address the manmade mass extinction, and the extra space would help\nus adopt more sustainable farming practices which\ncan maintain output for decades to come. A plant-based diet is healthy and costs about 20% less than the\naverage.\nTransitioning to plant-forward diets is not about\nbeing perfect or strict \u2013 it is about eating more plants\nand less meat and dairy. Scientists know this is a social\ntransition we need to make, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report and the UK Government\u2019s National Food Strategy both mention it. To\nquote Michael Pollan, \u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly\nplants.\u201d\nthe project was there or not.\u201d Referring to leakage, Eisen\nsaid, \u201cEven if you stop deforestation in one place, that\ndoesn\u2019t mean a logger won\u2019t just go to the next province and log there.\u201d Finally, offset projects are not per-manent. \u201cIn theory, you might save deforestation for a\nyear or two,\u201d Eisen explained, \u201cbut what happens if in a\nwarming climate there\u2019s forest fires and all the credits\nbought by a fossil fuel company go up in smoke?\n\u201cThere are so many problems at the conceptual level\nwith offsets,\u201d Eisen continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to\nmake them credible for about 15 years now, and they still\nhaven\u2019t been able to do it. The current price of carbon is\nless than US$1.00 a tonne on the voluntary markets, and\nthat\u2019s not a large enough incentive to induce behavioural change in forests.\u201d\nTwo weeks ago, Imperial researchers co-authored a\npaper in Science highlighting yet another problem with\nSBTs. They assume that the market share of a company\nwill remain the same in the future \u2013 the most polluting\ncompanies now will remain the most polluting in decades\u2019 time, albeit with lower absolute emissions. This\ndoes not allow space for greener, more ethical emerging\ncompetitors to emit much carbon dioxide without overshooting a sector\u2019s Paris Agreement targets. As what the\npapercalls\u2018solution-providing\u2019companiesexpand,their\ncarbon emissions will expand too. The Science-Based\nTargets Initiative does not account for this because it\ncannot imagine existing, polluting corporations losing\ntheir market share to new companies. These existing\ncorporations form 48% of the Science-Based Targets Initiative\u2019s income, as they pay to get their decarbonisation\nplans validated.\nWhen asked what Imperial can do instead of relying\non SBTs, Joe Eisen emphasised the importance of divesting from fossil fuels. \u201cI know there\u2019s a line of argument\nthat you need to stay in the house to change the house,\nwith the rise of activist investing and so on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\nthink some of the recent cases have shown the limitations of this approach.\u201d Eisen also suggested Imperial\ninvests in \u201cother projects which support sustainable\ndevelopment in tropical forest countries that empower\nand equip local communities to have what they need to\nprotect and thrive in their forests.\u201d\nPlant-Based Universities\nmotion loses 11-13 in the\nUnion Council\nPlant-BasedUniversitiesImperialcampaigner\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nA\nD\nD\nI\nT\nIONALIT\nY\nLEA\nK\nA\nG\nE\nP\nE\nR\nM A N E\nN\nC\nE\nSimran Patel\n\n"

It was from the takeaway\ncounter behind me, as I sat facing the interior.\nA well-lit sight: meticulously arranged, crackle-glass\nlamps, quilted chairs and tables not an inch out of place,\nand a picture-still scene of a restaurant awaiting its\nguests, greeted me.\nIt\u2019s a Uyghur restaurant. The Uyghur people are native\nto Xinjiang, a large province in far-west China bordering\nCentral Asia. Turkic-speaking and Quran-abiding, they\nare a distinctive community from Han Chinese, the majority in China.\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect, being part of \u2018the majority\u2019 and coming from the opposite corner of China \u2013\nHong Kong. But ever since the incidents in recent years\nthat made Uyghur people known to the world, I\u2019d gained\nan inexplicable feeling of kinship with this faraway, rural community.\nThis would be the first time I tried their food \u2013 food\nin China is synonymous with home. Excited yet clueless about where to start, I picked the first item on the\nmenu.\nSoon, a steaming bowl of Laghman was brought to my\ntable. I thought it had a somewhat earthy look. Loops of\nchunky noodles of varying thicknesses emerged from a\nbottom layer of rust-red stir-fry sauce. Piled on top were\nrough cuts of tomato, Bulgarian pepper, and onion. Slices\nof fried lamb were interspersed among the vegetables.\nAgainst the backdrop, the dish looked harmonious.\nWhether it be the wooden chairs with emerald-green\nquilting that lined the tables, the greeneries that dotted\nthe space, or the off-white stone panels that tiled the\nwalls.\nI first took a strand of the bouncy noodles and gave\nit a few swirls, so that it was coated with the sauce. The\nsauce had the sweetly acidic taste of tomato and a kick\nof chilli pepper, and it gained a slight sheen from the oil.\nI took another strand with the vegetable dice.\nBut delight came with the moment I bit into the\nfried lamb, and savoury juice oozed out. The tender\nlamb was satisfying with chewy noodles; vegetables\ninterjected the denseness and made the lamb\u2019s flavour\nsing higher.\nOne strand after another, as if under a spell, the dish\nwas emptied before I noticed.\nThe West End is once again lit up with lights to celebrate Ramadan, an important month for Muslims\naround the world, including the Uyghurs. It\u2019s a glowing\nsymbol of the fact that, in this city, diversity is strength.\nTo the hundreds of Uyghurs who have settled in London,\nwhose second home is the handful of Uyghur restaurants they opened: I hope you have a light, happy Ramadan.\nNote: This article was submitted to Felix on 10th April\n2024, when Ramadan was still in full swing.\nDilara:\nUyghur\nrestaurant in\nLondon\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nFoodWriter\nCHARMAINE CHUE\nI went knowing only\nramen and lamian.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | Comment 10 May 2024\nW\nell, here we are. A quarter of the\nway through the 21st\ncentury, and\ncarbon emissions are still rising\nmaestoso, like the balloon house from Up\n\u2013 except the house is on fire and the talking dog is dead. And I guess in this case\ntheballoonsarefilledwithCO2\n?Butthat\u2019s\ndenser than air, so it wouldn\u2019t\u2026 anyway,\nthe point is that things aren\u2019t looking\ngreat. Oil companies are seeing record\nprofits, climate sceptics are now piloting governments, and weather all across\nthe globe is going bananas. Wildfires,\ncyclones, glacial collapse, and mass extinctions have become typical. In scientific terms, the Earth\u2019s having a very bad\ntime, and this is something that everybody with an internet connection and an\nounce of critical thinking knows. Even\nparagraphs like this have become clich\u00e9.\nIt\u2019s not ideal for one\u2019s mental health. So,\nin the face of total, biblical disaster, how\ndo you avoid total, biblical depression? If\nplanet bad, how feel good? Because, to be\nhonest, science isn\u2019t helping.\nThat\u2019s not to say science isn\u2019t helping\nthe climate crisis. In the current absence\nof any truly disruptive protests, scientists\nare the only people in politicians\u2019 ear-shots willing you yell at them about global warming \u2013 they\u2019re doing their best,\nthough it won\u2019t be enough. What I\u2019m saying is that the fields of science and technology are not well-suited to countering\nthis pervasive air of defeatism. Eco-grief\ndoes not seem to be a disease that STEM\ncan cure. On the one hand, you have climate scientists issuing constant warnings about Points Of No Return that grab\nheadlines, but are never quite as bad\nas they\u2019re made out to be. After all, the\nworld hasn\u2019t ended quite yet. Things are\ngetting worse, but they can always get\nbetter if we put in the effort.\nAnd on the other side of things, you\nhave the tech-bros claiming that by 2030\nmarket forces will have made everyone\nswitch to renewables anyway, and we\u2019ll\nbuild these great big filters that\u2019ll suck\nup all the carbon and store it\u2026 somewhere\u2026 and nuclear! Oh, just wait until\nyou hear about how completely flawless\nnuclear power is, and don\u2019t forget we\u2019ll\nall be able to move to Mars soon, so does\nany of it really matter? It\u2019s a comfort, but\nit\u2019s wishful thinking. Poor people are\nnever going to Mars, nuclear power has\nplenty of its own issues, and nobody\u2019s\nput up the cash for large-scale carbon\nsequestration. Sorry lads, but capitalism\u2019s not going to solve a problem that\ncapitalism created.\nThat leaves me banging the drum for\nthe arts. If you feel you\u2019re staring down\nthe barrel of an ecological apocalypse,\nthe good news is that it\u2019s a barrel everyone else is examining as well. Historically we find art flourishing during catastrophe \u2013 after all, nothing gets the creative\ngears running like the collapse of one\u2019s\nworld. Think of the titanic body of poetry written in the trenches of WW1, or\nthe subversion of Dada, Surrealism, and\nother \u2018degenerate\u2019 art forms under Nazi\noccupation. Since time immemorial,\nhumans have been painting and writing\nand sculpting beauty in the face of disas-ter, and we can draw on this for strategy\nand fortitude in the days to come. From\nJoy Harjo\u2019s climate poem A Map to the\nNext World: \u2018You will have to navigate by\nyour mother\u2019s song, renew the song she\nis singing/Fresh courage glimmers from\nthe planets.\u2019\nHarjo was the first Native American to\nserve as US poet laureate. She says that\n\u2018arts are how we know ourselves as human beings.\u2019 and I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nIt\u2019s all very well to see the raw data of\nglobal heating, but internalising the human cost and the need for direct action\u2019s\nanother task. Populations and statistics\ncan quickly become meaningless; really,\nwhat we need is a personal connection.\nPhilosopher Tim Morton has described\nclimate change as a \u2018hyperobject\u2019 \u2013 a material object that\u2019s too spread out in space\nand time to be easily pictured. Where\nfilm, literature, and music outstrip climatology is in their ability to bring this\nhyperobject into focus.\nYou have protest music, from Bob Dylan to Kay Tempest, distilling that mood\nof desperation and despair into something you can sing while chucking bricks\nthrough windows at Canary Wharf. You\nhave films, like Ghibli\u2019s Princess Mononoke, which depict our relationship to nature changing around us; and you have\nfilms that shows how far people will go\nto defend that nature, like the recent adaptation of Andreas Malm\u2019s How To Blow\nUp A Pipeline. In literature, there\u2019s now\na whole genre of \u2018cli-fi\u2019: that is, science\nfiction like that of Kim Stanley Robinson\nand Octavia Butler which seeks to invent\na climate-ravaged future and show how\nwe might live through it.\nI recently read through one of these\nbooks: Dead Astronauts by Jeff VanderMeer. It\u2019s stuck with me, not because of\nany lucid and rational approach to the\nscience of global warming, but because\nof the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s a book almost impossible to understand. It\u2019s a story told\nin fragments, in poetry and logbook en-tries, in streams-of-consciousness and,\nat times, the same phrases repeated\nagain and again for several pages on end.\nIts narrators include a blue fox, a giant\nmutant fish, a column of sentient moss,\nand a nihilistic astronaut. At its core is\nan ecological crisis, similar in ways to\nthe alien blights of VanderMeer\u2019s bet-ter-known novel Annihilation\u00b8 but in this\ncase totally anthropogenic. It\u2019s chaotic,\noff-kilter, and very, very, strange. In other\nwords, it\u2019s a perfect impression of how it\nactually feels like to be living in an era of\nclimate catastrophe.\nThe arts are a comfort because they\u2019re\nrelatable. Everyone has had a moment\nwhere some oppression they\u2019re facing,\nor a dilemma they\u2019ve wrestling with has\nbeen depicted perfectly in a piece of me-dia. The moment where you say, \u201cYes.\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s how I feel,\u201d can really\nbe a lifeline to someone suffering. 45%\nof young people say that climate anxiety affects their daily functioning. In the\nabsence of proper mental health provi-sions, it\u2019s art where we can find people\nworrying about the same problems that\nwe are. This is also the reason that representation matters so much \u2013 keeping\nmarginalised groups and their issues out\nof mass media is a very effective way to\nprevent those issues from being recognised as systemic.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with climate grief,\nyou should talk to people about it. But if\ntheywon\u2019tlisten,youcanstillfindcatharsis in the stories being told about global\nwarming by artists from every different\nbackground, all over the world. Ignore\nthe attempts by technocrats to present\nclimate change as an equation in search\nof a neat, commercial solution. This is\ndark, and messy, and needs a plethora\nof voices to address. That\u2019s something\nthat artists understand better than sci-entists, I think. It\u2019s certainly in art where\nI\u2019ve found most of my hope. In the hurricane of words and images that make up\nDead Astronauts, it can at times feel like\nthe world VanderMeer created is without\npurpose, happiness, or hope. Yet, at the\nheart of the book is a simple affirmation\nof how much we can weather, so long as\nwe\u2019re around to weather it: \u201cWhat is too\nmuch to bear?\u201d the blue fox asks itself\nand its companions. \u201cNot being alive is\ntoo much to bear.\u201d\nSing, protest, read bad books. This too\nshall pass, if we can hold on through the\nstorm.\nCOMMENT\nWhy we need\nthe arts to tackle\nclimate defeatism\nCommentWriter\nDANIEL HESK\n\n"

All staff are\nguaranteed a 4% uplift, rising to 7% for\nthose on the lowest pay scales.\nTrade union negotiators had originally\nrequested a median 6.1% increase in\norder to maintain real terms pay at its\nlevel in 2005, when Imperial withdrew\nfrom national pay bargaining.\nSince 2005, the College has\nnegotiated pay for all staff directly\nwith representatives from the Imperial\nbranches of three trade unions \u2013 UCU,\nUnite, and UNISON \u2013 known collectively\nas the Joint Trade Unions.\nThe trade unions recommended\nthat their members vote to accept the\nuniversity\u2019s latest offer, saying: \u2018For at\nleast half of College staff, [Imperial\u2019s\noffer] is above the current inflation rate\nwhich means we are starting to close the\ngap between pay and inflation.\n\u2018While we believe that the College\ncould afford more this year, [this offer]\nis the best that can be achieved through\nnegotiation.\u2019\nSome trade union members were\ndismayed that even the highest earners\nwould be guaranteed a 4% rise in salary,\nbut the pay package was ultimately voted\nthrough.\nIn addition to the wage increases,\nImperial says it will increase family\nemergency leave from three to five days\nfrom 1st\nAugust 2024 and commence a\nreview of annual leave entitlements.\nThe university will also start work on\nlong-awaited reforms to the pay scale for\nProfessional, Technical, Operational, and\nLearning staff.\nThe JTUs\u2019 collective spat over wages\nbegan in July 2022, when members of\nall three unions rejected Imperial\u2019s pay\naward for the next academic year.\nDeclaring a formal dispute, they\naccused Imperial of \u2018refusing to budge\u2019\nin negotiations. For the first time, all\nthree unions commenced strike action\ntogether.\nThe trade unions escalated their action in May last year after members rejected Imperial\u2019s\nI\nmperial has spent nearly half a million\npounds on its polarising new logo and\nbrand project, according to a College\ndisclosure issued in response to a wave of\nfreedom-of-information (FOI) requests.\nThe logo was met with derision upon\nits unveiling at the end of February, and\nspawned a petition calling for its removal\nthat has gained over 8,000 signatures.\nImperial says that the costs, totalling\n\u00a3434,801.47, include spending on\nexternal agencies who provided \u2018brand\nstrategy,verbalandvisualidentity,design\nassets for launch, templating, training,\nand an assessment of the accessibility\nand inclusivity of the refreshed brand\u2019.\nDesign studio Pentagram worked on\n\u2018brand strategy and creative elements\u2019\naccording to the College website.

Critics say that the word\n\u2018Imperial\u2019, presented alone, harks back\nto the university\u2019s historical links to the\nBritish Empire.\nThey have contrasted the new logo\nwith the university\u2019s decision in 2020\nto remove Imperial\u2019s motto (\u2018Scientific\nknowledge, the crowning glory and\nthe safeguard of the empire\u2019) from the\nCollege crest.\n\u2018Our full institutional name \u2013 Imperial\nCollege London \u2013 remains unchanged,\u2019\nwrites the College in its FOI disclosure,\nadding that it has \u2018chosen to use Imperial\nas an official visual shorthand for our\nname in our logo.\n\u2018London remains a hugely important\npart of who we are, and will be fully\nreflected through our brand outputs,\nincluding through imagery and text.\u2019\nCollege spent half a million pounds\non \u2018brand refresh\u2019 and logo\nCosts include\nan \u2018inclusive\nresearch agency\u2019.\nAll staff to get\nminimum 4% wage\nboost after JTUs\naccept pay award\nREAD MORE ON 6\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nWalt Gao for Felix\n\n"

The College asks any fossil fuel\ncompanies it invests in to commit to the\nScience Based Targets (SBTs) Initiative, a\nUnited Nations-backed program which\nmonitors and assesses the net zero targets of companies. Imperial believes\nsigning up to SBTs \u2018will enable fossil fuel\ncompanies to reach net zero by 2050 (or\nearlier) with realistic interim targets,\u2019\naccording to its Socially Responsible Investment policy.\nHowever, SBTs do not hold a company liable for all of its emissions. Their\nalignment to Paris Agreement targets\nonly includes scopes 1 and 2 emissions,\nnot scope 3. Scope 1 is a company\u2019s direct\nemissions, and scope 2 is emissions from\noperating the company\u2019s infrastructure,\nsuch as electricity. On the other hand,\nscope 3 emissions are most of a company\u2019s\nindirect emissions, including employee\nand student flights. A 2021-22 evaluation\nfound that 79% of Imperial\u2019s emissions\nwere scope 3, but this did not include any\nflights from overseas students, who make\nup 61% of undergraduates and postgradu-ates. We calculated that including flights\nfrom students and staff may increase\nscope 3 emissions to 85% of total emissions which are ignored by SBTs.\nFor fossil fuel companies, scope 3\nemissions include the emissions created\nby burning the fossil fuels they extract \u2013\nwhich don\u2019t feature in the SBTs. According to GlobalData, Shell\u2019s invisible scope\n3 emissions made up 97.14% of their total\n2021 GHG emissions.\nMoreover, fossil fuel companies are\nnot meeting the SBTs by scaling down\ntheir oil and gas production. According\nto the think tank Common Wealth, Shell\ninvested five times as much in oil and gas\nas it did in renewables and energy solutions in the third quarter of 2023. It also\nfound that BP invested 11 times as much\nin oil and gas as it did in \u2018low carbon technologies\u2019. Restricting supply \u2013 such as\nstopping any new oil or gas licences \u2013 is\nimportant to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nLast month, the Science Based Targets\nInitiative allowed the use of \u2018carbon credits\u2019 as evidence that a company is reducing its scope 3 emissions. The idea is that\nprotecting a rainforest from deforestation would offset the carbon emissions\nthat company creates. However, \u2018protecting\u2019 an area tomorrow does not justify\nusing the carbon credits to burn fossil\nfuels today. \u201cCarbon offsetting is problematic on so many different levels,\u201d said\nJoe Eisen, executive director of Rainforest Foundation UK. \u201cFirst and foremost,\nit enables business-as-usual in the Global\nNorth. And then there\u2019s all sorts of problems around whether it actually does anything to stop climate change. For exam-ple, it\u2019s so easy for companies to inflate\nthe baseline of deforestation and say that\nall this deforestation would be far higher\nif we weren\u2019t there. That means they can\ngenerate more carbon credits to sell, but\nit may not be linked to reality.\u201d\nIn response to the change in carbon\ncredit guidelines, employees of and advisers to the Science Based Targets Initiative have called for the CEO to resign. According to Bloomberg UK, some advisors\nfelt they were not sufficiently consulted\nbefore the change was made.\nEisen told Felix that there are several\nother problems with carbon credits \u2013 including additionality, leakage, and per-manence. Additionality means \u201cpeople\nwill never know what would happen if\nAre carbon\ncredits and\nScience\nBased Targets\nmisleading?\nENVIRONMENT\nImperial College might be assessing\nfossil fuel companies using\noversimplified emissions metrics.\nEnvironmentEditor\nSIMRAN PATEL\nScience Based Targets Initiative\nTwo weeks ago,\nImperial researchers\nco-authored a paper\nin Science highlighting\nyet another problem\nwith SBTs.\n\u201c\nEnvironmentWriter\nPETER KNAPP\n\n"

There are kernels of truth in these pre-conceptions. But, if there is one that rings particularly\nfalse, it would be that, beneath its austere atmosphere \u2013\nexposed-concrete buildings, scaffolded monument, and\nrusting ambiguously shaped statue \u2013 lies a wasteland for\nthe arts. Or, at best, they are relinquished to unimpor-tance: filler for real conversations, about the sciences.\nAn abundance of artistic and creative societies\nthankfully subvert this notion. However, as often is the\ncase, it\u2019s not just the now we\u2019re talking about, but an\nidentity formed over years. Fortunately, as history would\nillustrate, not everyone at Imperial has fit into the mould\nof a \u2018scholar of the Sciences\u2019.\nOne such person was H. G. Wells, a student of\nbiology between 1884 and 1887, at a time when Imperial was still the Royal College of Sciences. Wells founded\nthe Science School Journal, which was created as a place\nto unite and share the range of thought and art that was\npresent in the college at the time. (This journal would go\non to become The Phoenix, evolving into the student-led\nnewspaper known as Felix that you read right now.) It\nwas in this journal that Wells published the short story\n\u2018The Chronic Argonaut\u2019, the first iteration of his revolutionary novel, The Time Machine, a landmark of science\nfiction. Though Wells failed his final year exams and\nultimately never obtained his degree in biology, he later\nwent on to be named an Honorary Fellow of the college.\nToday, Felix remains an outgrowth of this,\nsustaining a relationship between the arts and the\nsciences for students. A place for students with a passion for writing and journalism across different fields to\ncome together and present their work to a large reader-ship.\nHowever, the argument is still to be made that Imperial has a need to let the arts to run deeper through its core\nidentity. As a man with great visions of the future, Wells\nforesaw this. It is the need to display how the arts and\nthe sciences reflect and spur each other on. This common harmony, between creativity and innovation, is required to truly and fully examine the human condition.\nMore importantly, there should a community for that,\nin order to develop both. Wells had dedicated himself\nto creating the Science Schools Journal in order to fulfil\nthese convictions. It is down to us to resurrect the idea\nof a school magazine of the Arts, or as it was called, The\nPhoenix.\nBOOKS\nA brief history, and a\ncall to The Phoenix\nBooksHistorian\nGEORGE MOREAU\nThe Time Machine.

Consumer-goods firm Unilever has\nalso altered its plastics-reduc-tion pledge from half by 2025 to\none-third by 2026. On the opposite end of the spectrum, we are\nseeing more investment into\nclimate tech and solutions than\never before, and increased funding for environmental organi-sations. A fine example of this\nis Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert\u2019s\ndecision to turn the company\ninto a non-profit organisation\na couple of years ago, with all\nof its profits now going towards\nwildlife conservation. Renewable-energy councils have also\nconfirmed that, as of 2023, seven countries worldwide are able\nto run on 100% renewable ener-gy. Spotify has also collaborated\nwith artists and activists to register \u2018Nature\u2019 as its own entity\non the streaming service. The\ninitiative involved the release of\na series of songs featuring the\nsounds of nature, with all royalties also going towards funding conservation practices.\nIt is this sheer endlessness\nand range of both positive and\nnegative stories \u2014 particularly\nthose relating to climate change\n\u2014 that can induce a mental fa-tigueinwriters,activists,andre-searchers alike. Nevertheless,\none topic I considered exploring\nwas the idea of climate doom-ism, which it seems appropriate\nto tackle in relation to my own\nwriter\u2019s block. Climate doom-ism is the acceptance\nof climate change\nas an inevitable series\nof events\nand fixation on the\nidea that\nnothing can\nbe done to\nreverse its ef-fects. There has\nbeen a marked shift\nfrom denial to doom-ism among climate deniers,\nand this new mode of thinking\ncan be detrimental to even the\nmost optimistic of us. With the\ndistressing reports released by\norganisations such as the IPCC\nand UNFCCC that the Earth is\npassing climate \u2018tipping\npoints\u2019 more rapidly\nthan anticipated,\nit should come\nas no surprise\nthat climate\ndoomism is\non the rise.\nOver the Easter break, I went\nback home, to a country that has\nless progressive environmental\npolicies than the UK does. On\nEarth Day (April 22nd), Hong\nKong (HK) implemented a city-wide ban on single-use plastics,\nwhich at first glance appears\nto be a major win for the envi-ronment. Unfortunately, when\nobserved more closely, loopholes and cracks can be found\nin the policy that reveal the lack\nof foresight that went into its\ndesign. Following the ban\u2019s im-plementation, there was confusion surrounding how\n\u2018single-use plastic\u2019\nwas defined.\nFor example,\nplastics used\nfor takea-way- f o o d\npackaging\nare excluded from the\nban until 2025,\ndespite it comprising a large proportion of the city\u2019s\nplastic waste. It was also\ndisheartening to see that, on\nthe business end, many establishments didn\u2019t seem prepared\nfor the ban to come into force,\nand few had taken the initiative\nto make the necessary transitions earlier, despite the\nlegislation having been\npassed over half a\nyear earlier.\nThis apparent apathy from\nboth the\nHK government and local businesses feeds into my sense of\nfutility about humanity\u2019s ability\nto make necessary transitions\ntowards a more sustainable civ-ilisation. And to return to the\nconcept of climate doomism, it\nis a similar kind of stagnation in\nglobal politics and mega-corpo-rations that discourages people\nfrom taking individual action,\nprotesting against unsustainable practices, or actively participating in voting. The latter\nis particularly topical, as 2024\nhas been named the \u2018biggest\nelection year in history\u2019, and so\nclimate activists have been encouraging the public to vote for\npoliticians with climate-friend-ly agendas.\nDespite the negative dialogue surrounding climate and\nenvironmental preservation,\nparticularly from mainstream\nnews sources, it is vital to recognise that the last few years have\nstill seen some massive leaps\nin these areas. This includes\ninnovative technologies for re-newable-energy and ecosystem\nmonitoring, and more-robust\nconservation and climate pol-icies. The acceleration of progress towards a more sustainable and liveable future should\nbe a cause for celebration as\nwell as a driver for wider positive change. Finally, the place of\nenvironmental journalism in all\nthis is to simultaneously bring\nattention to challenges and setbacks while promoting successes and encouraging further contribution to these causes. There\nis value in using the written\nword to spread optimism and\nhope, especially in what appears\nto be the most dire of circum-stances.\nNot all doom and gloom\nWITH ZANNA BUCKLAND\nNavigating the negative narrative of climate doomism\n\n"
