    "content": "Reviews\nFilms\nPLEPHANT\nTHE GREATNESS of a film is very difficult\nto discern. This film, is however, an\nextremely different film that elicited\nspontaneous applause as the credits finished.\nAs those who have read the book True\nHistory of the Elephant Man will realise it\nfollows the final years in the life of Joseph\n(John) Merrick who suffered from the\ncongenital and malignant condition neuro-fib roma to s is. He is discovered by Frederick\nTreves (Anthony Hopkins) in a freak show\nunder the con to l of Bytes (Freddie Jones). It\nSurgeon Frederick Treves being threatened by\nBytes, who claims ownership of the Elephant\nMan\nis here explained that the elephant man is\nthe result of his mother being struck down\nby an African elephant at a Leicester fair.\nThis explains the opening dream sequence\nwith its savage overtones.\nHe is brought to the London Hospital\nwhere his grotesque deformities are shown\nto a pathological society meeting.\nThe drama explores the unfolding of\nMerrick's( John Hurt) character through\nmeetings with the famous and infamous.\nJohn Merrick arrives at the London Hospital to be examined by Mr Treves.\nThe claim to follow the true story is more-or-less false; the writers and director have\nproduced a fable. This fable is centred upon\nthe truely noble character of Merrick; he is\nseen to ennoble those around him, questioning the very root of Victorian hypocrisy.\nIts attitudes are revealed in the scene\nbetween the noted actress, Madge Kendal\n(Anne Bancroft) and Merrick when they read\nfrom Romeo and Juliet, she sees Merrick\npersonifying, in spirit, the romantic hero (yet\nfated to remain celibate). Many of the most\nmoving scenes are those when he speaks the\nlines that Merrick is known to have said;\nthese scenes which appear to be over\ndramatic (the vanity case scene) are shown\nto be doubly tragic.\nJohn Hurt is un recognisable both vocally\nand visibly by stunningly accurate make-up.\nHis performance conveys all the pathos and\nsincerity of Merrick and is a just homage to a great man. In support, John Gielgud (as Carr\nGomm, Chairman of the Hospital Committee)\nand Freddie Jones are excellent. Freddie\nJones, in particular, giving the wholly fictitious\nBytes sinister solidity when the script could\nhave left him as merely a caricature.\nThe film itself is shot in black and white in\ngloomy sets representing the period ac-curate ly. The music is secondary but\nsupports dramatic scenes with evocative\nsubtlety.\nThe closing scenes of Merrick at the\ntheatre reveal that he is just as much an\nexhibit as ever. Yet his naivety allows him\nonly to give the theatre audience the best of\nmotives. That evening he finishes his model\nof St Phillips Cathedral, the spire of which is\nthe only part he has ever seen from his\nwindow. He then fulfils his desire for\nnormality by sleeping in the prone position\n(his deformities permitting sleep only in the\nsitting position). This act of suicide is the\nsupreme act of dignity, the only decision he\ncan freely take.\nThe film is a brilliant homage to a great\nman. I would earnestly recommend it to\nanyone reading this review. Its supreme\ntragedy is the very existence of Merrick in\nthe 19th Century. One is left to speculate\nwhether he would be better cared for now or\nwould he remain an outcast left to cry: \"I am *\nnot an animal, I am a human being\".\nStephen Goulder\nLa Derobade\nLA DEROBADE is the story of a prostitute;\nher life and her work.\nIf it has a moral, it is to reveal the\ninjustices experienced by the girls working\nfor pimps.\nIt is a French film set in Paris. There are\nEnglish subtitles, but this does not affect\nyour viewing, as there is little talking. Marie\nMage (Miou-Miou is her real name!), a pretty, innocent, nineteen year old, meets a handsome, flashy guy in a cafe by the name\nof Gege (Daniel Duval). She is fascinated by\nhim and they fall in love. One morning, in\nbed, he tells her that he wants her to work\nfor him as a prostitute; he will be her pimp.\nShe dislikes the idea, but accepts. She is\nrepulsed, initially, but soon gets used to 'the\nlife'.\nAs the relationships and injustices evolve\nwe are taken through the tricks of the trade\nuntil the story comes to an anticlimactic end.\n(Well, you've got to have some balance!)\nI was pleasantly surprised by the film. It\nthreatened to be just another cheap 'sex and\nviolence' X, but all the action in the bedroom\nwas relevant and the characters sensitively\nportrayed. What violence there was was\nnecessary to the story.\nThe French have a strange, sensual quality\nto their films which makes them worthwhile\nin themselves.\nIf you like films about people, then I'd recommend La Derobade, although it is not\nin the 'erotic' class of Emmanuelle.\nRunning time: 114 minutes.\nM Cadwallader\nThe Long Riders\nTHE JESSE JAMES gang: Frank and Jesse\nJames, Cole, Jim and Bob Younger, and Ed\nand Clell Miller, are generally regarded as\nbeing 'the greatest outlaws that ever lived'.\nDuring the fifteen years that they evaded\ncapture, they robbed at least a dozen banks,\nand as many stagecoaches and trains. Their\nfirst raid was on Liberty, Missouri in 1866,\njust after the end of the Civil War, and the\ngang was not finally broken up until after\ntheir bloody raid on the First National Bank\nof Northfield, Minnesota, when Frank and\nJesse abandoned the other members of the\ngang, all of whom had serious gunshot\nwounds, to capture, and sentences of life\nPage 10 FELIX, October 17, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Sir\nI would like to express my support for the letter in last week's FELIX from the Snooker Club. As a woman at IC,I have always made great use of the I CW A Lounge. I still wonder why it was necessary to move the meeting place of along established association to the third floor since this is very inconvenient to I CW A members and members of the Snooker Club in the adjoining room. The new room is not at all suitable for I CW A meetings orl or use as the I CW A Lounge. I feel that both clubs should have been consulted along with the student body in general before the move was made. Tours faithfully\nSheila Cox Geology2 Dear Sir\nI feel that for the benefit of\nfresher s and others unaware of the I CW A presidential situation at the moment that the time is\nnow right to express my view sonIC WA and to justify my lack of presidential action. This lack of action does not stem from a lack of interest in the welfare of women a tIC, quite the reverse, in fact. I feel\nthat I CW A, as it stands, does very little for the vast majority of its members, and the ease\nwith which I stood unopposed for president provided an ideal opportunity to demonstrate the circus which I CW A had become. Although I feel that noone person has the right to attempt to close down I CW A, it is surely the right of any member to express their opinions within the legal structure of the constitution of that society. So, perfectly within my rights as a member of IC WA,I stood for President, stating clearly my views and intentions before being duly ratified as the sole candidate for the post, demonstrating the diminishing interest in I CW A by the ordinary women at IC, which was also illustrated by the fact that I was the only candidate lor any committee post who actually turned up in person at the meeting for rat if a cation.S oI feel that I stood, not as\none person attempting to destroy I CW A out of pure animosity, but as a figurehead for the many women at IC who have lost interest in I CW A and everything lor which it now stands. I should also like to add that although I did receive advice from VARIOUS people familiar with the technicalities and constitution of I CU,I believe strongly in the methods I chose to express my opinions. In conclusion, I feel that my point has been made and by the time people read this the I CW A Committee will have received my resignation and my withdrawal from membership and have the chance now to elect a new President for the remainder of the session. Tours faithfully\nSandra O' Sullivan I CW A President Dear Sir\nI would like to reply, via your letters page to the Snooker Club President's queries regarding the TV/I CW A Lounge. This lounge had ceased to be used for TV watching before March10,1980, when House Committee decided to convert it\nto a committee room, changing the locks to stop its use as a corridor. I had naturally presumed that Malcolm had informed Snooker Club of this at\nthe time, as he should have informed them of the decision of Joint House Committee on June3 to give I CW A use of the room, allowing the newly named Upper Lounge to be used at lunchtimes for various committee meetings. The main problem is that the room cannot be fully sealed of l due to the need for a fire escape route from the central to the east staircase. Thus the doors could easily be secured with sni blocks, and Iam assured by an authority on locks that these would invariably be used continually, rather than only in an emergency, making it rather pointless spending money installing them. The second problem is that the Union ByLaws state: \" A portion of the Union Buildings shall be set aside for the use of the members of Imperial College Women's Association\", so until such time as this is amended, I CW A must be provided with a room. As for the lounge being the only room available lor Snooker Club's\" long awaited third table\", Iam sorry to disappoint members, but after checking estimates and consulting the RC C Chairman, I can find no money allocated( even provisionally), unless of course the members are going to produce the \u00a3 2 , 0 0 0 to \u00a3 2 , 5 0 0 themselves. I had already explained all this personally to the President ol Snooker, Club, and I hope it\nis now clear to all ol its members. Rachel S nee Deputy President. Sir\nAnyone replying to the ICC B Club Small Ad( FELIX,562)\" via Channel19\" will have been contravening the Wireless Telegraphy Act,1949 this carries a maximum line of\n/ . 4 0 0 , and confiscation of all equipment. They will also have been causing severe and potentially dangerous interference to\nthe legal users of27 MHz band( radio control operators and members of the medical profession).Al l rather unnecessary, really, considering that members of\nHAM SOC(I C Amateur Radio Society) operate radio transmitters covering HF, VHF, and UHF perfectly legally. We assume that the ICC B Club is in fact non existant, and that no such illegal activity is\nbeing carried out in the name ol Imperial College. Should an ICC B Club be formed, we trust\nthat IC Union will carefully examine its activities before allocating lund s. It is not that Ham soc is\nopposed to a legal' CB' in this country. Indeed, the committee is considering its reply to the Home Office' Open Channel' discussion document, and would welcome contributions from the proC Be rs at College. However, we are certainly opposed to the activities of the27 MHz pirates that are bringing the hobby of amateur radio into disrepute.73, Russell Whitworth, G4C TP John Savage. G8R RD David L egg, G8WU F Andrew Lav ton, RS39959I an Jones, G8L WI Andy Sharpe. G8ML M Chris' Gall a cher, G4J CX Keith Prior, G8XH K Sir\nWe the undersigned are writing seeking advice concerning the present moral attitude of our colleague and co habitant. We are led to believe, by force of circumstance( i.e. he doesn't come home at night, and is always' tired' when we see him) that our colleague is conducting himself in a most ungentlemanly and unbecoming manner. We, being pure, chaste, upstanding, Christian citizens, have great difficulty in comprehending the erring ways of our companion, and feel that his soul needs some further guidance back on to the path of righteousness, from which he has unfortunately strayed. We would, therefore, be eternally grateful for any advice which could lead to the salvation of our poor friends misguided state of mind. l ours concerned ly KJ Che'll SJ Cavanagh JP Curry Dear Steve\nConcerning your article in last Friday's FELIX, I strongly protest at the title of your article\" Arab/IC Radio Conflict\" and accept your apology. I point out that there is no CONFLICT in existence and that the word Arab bears no significance in relation to the article. Secondly, I would point to the word' mosque'. We only requested a' room' for our lunchtime prayers between12:00 and2:30 pm. At present we are in15 Princes Gardens and we have had a problem for the past four years in finding a room. Now the room at No.15 can be used for other purposes as well as being booked by us\nfor the2'/2 hours. It does not\nrender the building religious, and we have not asked lor free\naccess at all times. I hope this suffices in reversing the argument in your article. I should also point out that the level of activity of our members is good and around ten to twenty people attend the daily prayers as well as between forty and seventy people on Fridays in the Union Concert Hall. Our many other events and projects are well publicised and have included Arabic classes, discussion groups, leaflets sent out to all students informing them about Islam as\nwell as the usual Islamic Week. The latter provides an ideal opportunity in an informal setting of anyone who wishes to\nknow more.Y Elsa ie Islamic Soc Page 2 FEUX. October 17, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "imprisonment. Jesse James was eventually\nshot dead in his own home by his cousin Bob\nFord (who later collected a$10,000 reward)\nin 1882, but Frank James lived on into old\nage, having turned himself in, been tried and\nacquitted.\nDirected by Walter Hill (with the Carradine\nbrothers cast as the Youngers) this film lacks\nthe vitality of his previous work The\nWarriors, its downbeat tempo and gloomy\nphotography emphasising the inevitability of\nthe gang's final destruction. Sadly, one and ai\nhalf hours of this becomes claustrophobic,\nexcessive use of slow-motion in the Northfield\nraid merely adding to the tedium.\nS Hodgson\nA film destined for success, it has everything\nthe public seems to want, it is escapist, it is\ncontrived, unrealistic, it is dull, and it has\npeople (to quote the pre-release publicity)\n\"swimming naked over coral reefs\". 1 found it\nthe most tedious two hours of my life, or\ncertainly of the last two years. My time\nwould have been better employed in a bus\nqueue, at least there I'd be able to see\ngenuine human beings, no idealised, car board cut-out, healthy, all A meri can/Californian-dream, whole-food models.\nThe plot of Blue Lagoon is tenuous to say\nthe least. Ship catches fire in Pacific, two\nkiddies and stereotype drunken Irish cook\nseparated from rest of ship. Land in nick of\ntime on wonderful desert island. The time\ndrags by as attempts are made to amuse you\nand moral is e at you as the cook teaches the\nkids to survive (not difficult in the tamed and\ngenerous Bounty-ad world portrayed here) it\nsucceeds only in being kitsch. Cook dies\n(anybody who plays a character that\nshallowly deserves it. Come on! Leo McKern, you should know better.) \"They\nswim naked over coral reefs\". Actually they\ngrow up during this bit and Brooke Shields\nand Christopher Atkins take over the roles.\nThey argue and bitch their way through the\nnext thirty minutes \"swimming naked over\ncoral reefs\". Then fall in love, have sex, have\na baby, teach baby to swim, and reach the\nmost unlikely part of a film that is shaky at\nbest. Mummy and baby are in boat, baby\nthrows oar into water, mummy, who up until\nthen swam like a fish, tries to reach over\nwith other oar, rather than fetch it she calls\ndaddy who fetches it, gets attacked by shark,\nother oar thrown at shark, daddy gets in\nboat; boat drifts into open sea, they attempt\nsuicide but are rescued in the nick of time by\nlong lost uncle/father. It's enough to make\nyou throw up.\nThe director, Randal Kleiser, must take\nthe blame for the films tedium. A man\nobsessed with people who \"swim naked over\ncoral reefs\" he pads out the story with\nunnecessary, though at first quite pretty\nshots of Brooke Shields, \"swimming naked\nover coral reefs\" with a blue filter, \"swim-ming naked over coral reefs\" covered in\nphosphorescence, and \"swim m ming naked\nover coral reefs\" with Christopher Atkins.\nBasil Poledouris's music is good, though\nun adventurous, it is the only part of the film\nto affect me with any feelings other than\nboredom. Sadly, the tension and emotion he\nconjured up were lost in a morass of awful\nacting. Brooke Shields will have done her\nreputation as a serious actress no good\nwhatsoever, with this display of woodenness\nand Leo McKern, likewise, was disappointing.\nAs for Christopher Atkins, the less said the\nbetter (though he does \"swim . . . reefs').\nBasically, it's worse than Crossroads, a terrifyingly dull movie. Apparently, it's been\nheavily cut (compared with the American\nversion) by the Censor, smart move I thought. You can spend a more interesting\nhour and thee quarters in a maths lecture,\nbut of course \"they swim naked over coral\nreefs\".\n\"Eric\" Jarvis\nFind out about Marketing Management\n^ ^ ting Manage iVan ft gee j f ft would SUit yOU.,.. business role in a dynamic \u2022=o \u201e\nix! \u00a3 , n \u00ab\nla total business role in a dynamic consumer industry,\nc. \u00a320,000 pa.+ car OXFORD Our client is a mult- This position will\nmillion pound inter- therefore attract\nnational company. honours graduates\nRecent changes have with business flair\nresulted in the need and a strong record of\nto hire a Marketing consistent\nManager to join the achievement.\nThe salary is backed\nThe successful by a company car and\ncandidate v/i\\\\be other important\ngiven the challenging benefits.

Tickets\nfrom the Union Office, \u00a31.\nOn September 9, Imperial College Health Centre played host\nto a conference on survival after nuclear attack. The conference was entitled Apres la Bombe'. If you think the\nFrench is meant to sound sexy (like so ix ante neuf), you may\nbe right. According to the Guardian (October 9), it was as if\nwe [the delegates] were being seduced away from realistic\nanalysis into something called \"planning\" based on unreality\nor irrelevant events.\nCoincidences, coincidences. The October issue of Morning Cloud,\nthe IC Conservative Society publication, carries an article entitle' Civil defence: more shelters are needed' by Tim Law es. Included in this nonsense is the classic:\" with protection from nuclear attack as well as the\nability to deliver it, a country' s bargaining position in a conflict is\nstronger\". Move on to the Conservative conference( October610). On the\n8 th, to explain the public issue of the booklet Protect and Survive\n( available from WH Smith, and better laughs than. Not The Nine\nO 'clock News), the Home Affairs Minister, Leon Britt a in, offered:\n' Disraeli once said,\" trust the people\", and that exhortation is\nsurely particularly apt when it\ncomes to talking about f nea sure s for our very survival as a nation'.' Trust the people'; yes, with ridiculous pamphlets; no, not with the details of post nuclear Britain, certainly not on the TV. The possibilities that de terrance is\ndangerous and doesn't work( e.g. Cuba) and that' survival' is worse than death( e.g. Hiroshima, Nagasaki) are hardly fit for mass consumption. Back to the Tory conference. On the Friday( October10), the\nDefence Secretary, Francis Py m, received a standing ovation for\none of the most fanatical pro armaments speeches heard in this\ncountry since the Cuba crisis, possibly bettering the already in famous Thatcher speech to the\naerospace industry, on September3. Pressure for more civil defence and for more arms are closely linked. On the one hand we are being softened up for nuclear war by a slick marketing campaign that offers a grateful population safety behind whitewashed windows and under kitchen tables,\nwhile spreading the idea that' limited' war is not only probably but even rather cosy. On the other, we are expected to concur with the daily increases in the chances of effective planetary annihilation through additions to\nthe already gross armaments stockpiles and through aggressive posturing s in the international arena. That this two headed technique is working well is shown by the\nlatest polls, in which a majority of people sampled both want to\nkeep nuclear weapons and expect nuclear war in the near future. This is not meant to bean attack solely on Conservatives. The Labour Conference voted for\nunilateral disarmament, the Liberals came close to it, but no Parliamentary party is ever likely to\nradically change the status quo whatever the conferences. Moreover, it is very unfortunate( though inevitable) that disarmament is such a' political' issue( defined as an issue for which public libraries refuse to touch leaflets and posters), and has become even more of one over the\nconference season. For one thing, pressure for the\nmanufacture, sale and use of armaments, nuclear or otherwise, comes from the\" whole centralised bureaucratic, military and industrial complex in the UK, whether the brand of centralism happens to be corporate( right) or state\n(left); purely political pressures simply reflect this deeper commitment. More importantly, political catcalling effectively camouflage the main battle, which is between ordinary people of all countries, who have no particular wish to\nexplode, roast or be radiated to\ndeath, and the international network of such central complexes in both East and West. The arguments about unilateral is mor multilateral is m( our Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, styles himself a multilateral is t), and about the pros and cons of increasing civil defence spending, are totally irrelevant. It is up to\npeople to persuade governments to remove nuclear weapons, with the utmost urgency, from the face\nof the planet. What is our government doing? What are we doing to persuade them? Everyone of us\nwho does nothing is responsible for the consequences for all time. IC Health Centre can at least\ntake consolation that it is unlikely ever to have to cope with post-nuclear survivors, even if this were a rational matter on which to hold a conference. It and most of the capital's health services, and IC itself, will probably be\nrubble and ashes.\nBrian (i oo dale References National Anti-Nuclear Action Groups\n(with acknowledgments to Re sur gence);, Friends of the Earth; Ecology\nParty; The Anti-Nuclear Campaign;\nGreenpeace; Conservation Soe.\nRCS SMOKING CONCERT\nDo you have any literary talent?

She was from the Westminster Volunteer Bureau and they desperately need people to help out with all kinds of voluntary work either on a regular( please) or one off basis. She cited cases like draught insulating old people's houses, helping children, taking disabled people for walks, or wheels in their wheelchair, teaching tng li sh to overseas Londoners, reading to blind people, cooperating with prisoners wives. The list was endless. So what we thought we'd do was to ask everyone who has any sparetime that they want to use in an out-of-student-life manner, if\nthey would help people who really won't be able\nto enjoy life without it? If you are the answer to our question, then please come and help us and the Westminster Volunteer Bureau, by dropping a line to Sean Coyle, Ele c Eng2 or visiting the ICCA GRoom on Monday at12:30 pm or shortly after.\nJohn Evans\nPhysics2 Exploration Soc\nARE YOU bored with IC already? Fancy a trip\nto Thailand or just a jaunt to the Arctic? The Exploration Society exists to bring together people who would like to travel, or have visited, some of the more diverse parts of the world. The Society encourages the organisation of expeditions in a number of ways. Weekly meetings are held at which films\nor lectures a represented. We are affiliated to\nthe Royal Geographical Society, conveniently situated at the top of Exhibition Road. Members have free access to RG S lectures and facilities;\nmap room, library, etc. We are also a member of the Young Explorers Trust which organises various seminars on all aspects of exploration. The College promotes expeditions by way of\nthe Exploration Board, which vets all proposals for overseas expeditions and also gives financial\naid( often a large amount!). So, if you want to find out more come along to our first meeting on Wednesday, October22 in Room302, Biochemistry, at 6 : 0 0 pm. Gay Soc\nWITH THE considerable oppression of gays in\nsociety and the law and the continuous misrepresentation of gays in the media and education it is likely that many people who are really gay will never realise themselves or only after they have other commitments, e.g. marriage, children, etc., leading to considerable conflict and misery. Please think about the following points:(1) Although it is likely that asexual preference is established early in life, there is no evidence that this preference can be permanently changed by heterosexual or homosexual experiences, e.g. why are there so many married gays who only realised their true nature after marrying. Do not be afraid of suddenly being fixed as gay \u2014 it's just a myth to try to frighten bisexual and gay people into conforming by suppressing their true nature.(2) The Christian Churches are by no means convinced of their attitude towards gay people; Catholic, Methodist, and C of E. churches are all holding considerable investigations to try to understand the situation of gays in their respective churches. Indeed over forty\nclergymen have signed a petition specifically\nrepudiating the masquerade of anti homosexual prejudice as Christian morality. MopSoc\nAFTER our highly controversial lecture on spin flip in plasmas, we now have a more lighthearted talk on probe m solving with soap bubbles. This talk, including large numbers of\ndemonstrations, will be given by D rIse nberg, well known in the Fairy liquid field for his bubbly personality. Bring along the bubble and strife, all will be made transparent at 1 : 0 0 pm, Tuesday, October21 in Physics. Follow the signs'.\nJohn Bambridge\nPS: Umbrellas are required for the first two rows.(3) The stereotypes of gays spread by the media are completely false; gays have the same spread of personality and jobs as heterosexuals, and it is certain that you have met many gay men and women without even realising it.\n(4) Involving yourself incoming along to a gay organisation, e. g.UL U discussion groups, requires no commitment whatever, you come along just as an observer. You can involve yourself as much or as little as you like \u2014 it is\nentirely up to you. If you think you maybe bisexual or gay please come along \u2014 you have nothing to lose\nand may save yourself the heartache in later life\nof 'if only'.\nUL U Gaysoc Meeting\nUniversity of London Union hold meetings every Thursday evening from8:00 pm in the UL U Building, Male tSt. The meetings comprise a speaker followed by discussion.

    "content": "By J. Passmore\nResidence\nI have had so many complaints from one thing\nto another on residence, mainly regarding non-repayment of deposits, deserving cases not\ngetting into Hall and the small question of\nRobert Pryor House at 53 Princes Gardens as\nwell as staff living in student residences that\nsomewhere questions must be asked and asked\nsoon. So if anyone else has any major\ncomplaints on residence could they please get\nin touch with me so that I can add to the file,\nand go to see College and try to fix things up.\nGreek Students\nAs you may know, Greece joins the EEC on\nJanuary 1, 1981. However, Greek students\nstarting at College now will be charged 'full cost'\nfees although EEC students are regarded as\nhome students for fee purposes. What the\nGreek students would like is to pay full fees up\nuntil January 1, 1981 and home fees from then.\nHowever this is not yet the case and there will\nbe a motion at Council and at the U GM asking\nCollege to charge the new Greek students at\nthe home rate. Until Registry produce actual\nstudent numbers then it will be impossible to\nestimate the amount of money involved. I would\nlike all Greek students to organise effectively\nand hope to do so through Hellenic Society so\nthat we can work in a co-ordinated fashion.\nUGM\nThe next U GM is on Tuesday, October 28.\nThe deadline for motions is Tuesday, October\n21 at 5:30pm. Suggestions & Complaints\nThere was a meeting of Suggestions and\nComplaints on Thursday, October9 which\nproduced nothing of great note. Do not forget\nthat the Suggestions and Complaints boxes are\navailable in al! outlets and are the most effective\nmeans of changing or improving the Refectory\nService.\nNo Dice\nI must say that I accept full responsibility for the\nNo Dice concert. It was due to a lack of\ncommunication on my part and I would like to\napologise to all those who worked on it or were\nconcerned with it.\nMatters Raised\nNoise\nAfter having tea with two ladies from Ennismore\nGardens, who are sick to death of the noise\nmade by residents in the Princes Gardens Halls,\nI'm sure I'd get just as annoyed hearing several\nhundred record players blasting, people hanging\nout of the windows shouting, etc. So PLEASE show some consideration, such as closing your\nwindows when playing music, turning it down\nafter 11:00pm, and generally trying to be less\nnoisy.\nFreshers' Fair\nYou may have thought you'd heard the last of\nthis (I certainly did!), but unfortunately a table\nbelonging to Dr C Halls, the Warden of Beit\nHall disappeared from the Bot/Zoo Common\nRoom during the event. It is a large, metal-frame table with a veneered wooden top, so if\nanyone has seen such a table which has\nsuddenly appeared from nowhere, please inform\nme or Dr Halls as soon as possible.\nCalling All Clubs And Societies\nAnyone owning any storage space in the Union\nBuilding, can I please have details of every\ncupboard, locker or filing cabinet, where it is\nand what it's used for. Then (hopefully) I can\nsort out some of the anomalies, and put the\nstorage facilities to their fullest use.\nAny club buying equipment, regalia, stationery,\nor indeed anything at all, please remember we\nare members of the Students Union Purchasing\nConsortium and thus can get hefty discounts\nwith many firms. So, before you buy anything\ncome and check out my files, as you may be\nable to get a better deal through the Consortium.\nAmusement Machines\nThese seem to be doing very well, but as I don't play on them myself, I 'll have to rely on your\nviews as to how good they are. So please come\nand tell me which pinball or video machine you\nprefer, if you have any ideas or new machines,\nor perhaps you think the queues are too long and\nthink we should get even more!\nI 'll look forward to hearing from you.\nRae\nLizzie's Wee Bit\nAFTER the hectic start to term and the first lot\nof parking permits being allocated, life is settling\ninto a very pleasant routine. However, there are\nseveral points I'd like to make.\nThe closing date for appeals for parking\nplaces is FRIDAY, OCTOBER17 with the\nresults being printed in FELIX on Friday, October 24. Any permit which has not been\ncollected from the Union Office by Friday,\nOctober 31 will be reallocated.\nAt the time of writing I am about to hold my\nsecond duplicating demonstration. Any person\nwho attended demonstrations last year must not\nassume that they will be allowed to have use of\nthe geste tn ers this year. All publicity officers or\nsecretaries must attend a demonstration. Should you have been unable to attend the\ndemonstrations please come and see me.\nAs far as insurance is concerned all the new\nhead tenancy schemes run by College and the\nUnion have been included on the Halls of\nResidence policy. The \u00a34 premium will be added\nto your first rent bill of the year. Again I will ask\nall clubs and societies to bring me an up-to-date\nlist of their property or equipment so I can add\nthem to the Group Policy. If a club/society\nholds their own policy please bring me a copy,\nwith the intention of me trying to include it in\nthe Group Policy.\nAll for now. jj fli C&G TOMORROW a large group of intrepid, brave,\nmasochistic Guilds men will descent on Portobello Road, to exploit the sadistic tendencies of the general public. The idea is to\nsell shaving foam 'pies', at a vast profit, to\nunsuspecting passers-by who then (the fools)\nwaste the pies by decorating the vendors' face\nwith them. This stunt has only been unleashed\non the public once before (by us, anyway) and\nmade quite a bit of money for charity. So for\nsomething a bit 'different', meet in the Guilds\nOffice tomorrow (Saturday, October18) at\n9:30am. Then, on Monday (October 20), is the Civ\nEng Freshers' Dinner. If you haven't got your\nticket yet, you might be too late, so dash off to\nthe Guilds Office straight away.\nThe following day (Tuesday, 21) there will be\na Theatre Trip to see Ibsen's Wild Duck,\nstarring Richard Briers and Nerys Hughes, at\nthe Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Only thirty\ntickets are available and are selling fast at only\n\u00a32.25 each. There might be one or two left, if\nyou're lucky, in the Union Office.\nSee you at 'Hit Squad'.\nOnce more into the breach dear friends and\nanother FELIX is with us again. Tonight sees\nthe last of the Freshers' Dinners, the infamous\nLife Sci Dinner, with party afterwards. Anyone\nwho has been to any of the other dinners can\ngo the party \u2014 it should be good. Hopefully the\ndinner will be as excellent as the rest have\nbeen. To let you recover after the party there is\nno Rag stunt tomorrow.\nLast week's stunt brought thirty-odd (very\nodd) clowns out on to the streets of Knightsbridge.\nUnfortunately Multiple Sclerosis were also out\ncollecting so the total was only \u00a3173.46'/2- Top\ncollector of the day was Rick Jones of Maths 1\nwith \u00a323.9772 which included a \u00a3 1 0 note!\nNevertheless an enjoyable time was had by all\nand most people managed to get a ride on Jez.\nThe next collection is on Saturday, October\n25, and is the alternative stunt which the\nPresident and Hon Sec organise. Watch out for\ndetails.\nEnts nights out have been well attended and\nmore are in the pipeline, the Ents Chairman\nsays, so look out for the posters.\nAh well, that's the end of this week's smasher o on ie, so it's back to the lab/Union\nOffice/bar/bed.\nPJ\nGood time Rich Archer\nA good time woz 'ad by all at the Ice Rink!\nBarney McCabe\nFELIX, October 17, 1980 Page 5\n\n"

The IV th s made a shaky start and soon( bund themselves a goal behind. Alter this set-back the standard of play improved slightly and with twenty minutes gone Kev Buckley equalise d with a well taken goal from a cross\nof Nick Flanagan. K CH quickly regained the lead as a result of defensive errors, to make the score21 and it remained so until the end of the first hall. The second half started with a much more determined attitude from IC and after a few\nnear misses we equalise d again, Roger Hunter scoring with a shot from the edge of the penalty area. IC dominated the game, from the non, with the ball hardly leaving the K CH half. It took until ten minutes from time before IC gained the lead through Nick Flanagan who placed the ball wide of the keeper from close range. The good second half performance was rounded off when Nick Flanagan scored again, beating the keeper from an acute angle just two minutes before the end. Team: V eats, Bern s, Kaye, Maddy, Ch own, Dolan, Hunter, Buckley, William s,Mc Nicholas, Flanagan, and Milner. Sixths Fight Back\nIC SIXTHS fought back superbly to win32 agin st Kings College Hospital after being two goals down inside ten minutes. The game started badly for IC as they struggled to find their rhythm and Kings were soon ahead when along range shot swerved un predictably in a blustery wind and ended up in the net. Kings struck again soon when a general mix up allowed a Kings forward to score. IC settled down after a bad start to take control of the game with Sean Davis and John Chamberlain using their speed to get behind the Kings defence only to be denied at the last\ngasp by the Kings goalkeeper. A goal had to\ncome and Dave Bradley's cultured through ball found Nigel Audi non the edge of the penalty area and a venomous shot put IC back into the game. IC were, by then, firmly\non top and many chances were created and missed by halftime. Early into the second half, IC were back on level terms when Mark Clegg scored after a devastating rundown the rightwing by Sean Davis. Incessant IC pressure followed and soon the Sixths were in the lead when John Chamberlain managed to score.\nAfter the restart Kings began to put some pressure on the IC defence but couldn't cope with the efficient tackling of Steve Davies, Mark Higham and Liam G art side and the confident sweeping of John Nag le. Kings continued the pressure and in the last few\nminutes a Kings forward shot following a goal mouth scramble, but he was denied what looked a certain goal when Neil Hampton flung himself across goal to make an exceptional save. The Sixth sheldon until the\nfinal whistle lor their best start to a season in\nliving memory. Team: Hampton, Higham, Nag le, Bradford, Davies, Aud in, Tinkle r, Clegg, G art side, Chamberlain, and Davies. Gaelic Football\nTHE NEWLY formed Gaelic FootballClub played its first game last Sunday between two teams of club members. The match, played on Hyde Park was an interesting mixture of keene s s and skill with James Carroll( of Union Bar fame) and the Club captain, John Passmore being prominent players. On Sunday19 we hope togo to see a REAL match, so anyone interested make sure\nto see me TODAY. Anyone interested in playing and has not\ngiven in his name please see John Passmore in the Union Office. By el or now. John Passmore\nHockey\nIC firsts\nLAST SATURDAY the1 st XI played against Birk beck College in their first leaguematch of the season.\nFrom the outset, IC looked the better side,\nbut after twenty minutes Singh shot into the\nroof of the net to put us behind. Despite this\nIC continued to control the game, and two minutes before halftime Steve Ga tley put us\nlevel with a narrow angled shot.\nIn the second half, IC finally took the lead through a well taken goal by John Clarke. There then followed a period of desperate activity by Birk beck, which only resulted in a few people limping, and IC safely held on. Team: Butler, Crowe, Riley, Davey, Hughes, Barry, Clarke, Ayr es, Rich and Bell Ga tley, and Whitaker. Hockey.^ ,\n*IC seconds\nTHIS WAS our first match of the season, and being the first league game as well, the outcome was especially important. The match started with heavy IC pressure and within fifteen minutes, Mike Chew opened the scoring. As often happens, the side relaxed after this\nand N PL came into the game, forcing several penalty corners. From one of these they were unlucky not to get a penalty stroke after the ball struck a defender's leg on the goal line.N PL scored in the closing minutes of the\nhalf, aided by what can only be described as\n' dubious' umpiring. IC were unlucky not to end the half up though, a flick from Mike Chew, which seemed headed for the top corner of goal was brilliantly palmed round the post by the\nkeeper. After the opposition had finished of fall the oranges at halftime, the second half started in a similar vein to the first, with persistent IC pressure, but with N PL strong on the break. It was left to Mike Cope to score from an acute angle, after a series of shots, all of which had beer i well blocked by the keeper this made the score21, at which it remained despite some anxious moments towards the end which led to the remodelling of one N PL hockey stick.\nThe side held out to complete a very competent all round performance which produced a well deserved two points, and a start that bodes well for the rest of the season. Team: Jones, Parker, Downing, Bird, Mason( Capt), Ross, Span ker, Chow, G arns, Gray, Cope and Shi ndler. Neil\nHi! I'm Deidre, and I 've appeared in FELIX for\nthe last six years. This year I'm appealing . . .\nfor people to take sports photos for FELIX.\nLadies Hockey\nDESPITE having only six definite players by Friday lunchtime, we managed to field a full\nteam; for five minutes, anyway! Jan slipped and hurt a leg muscle, thus rendering herself unable to play the rest of the match. Not to\nbe daunted, IC battled on. Although Q.E C took advantage of an initial state of confusion in our defence to score a nearly goal, IC rapidly sorted themselves out and began to dominate the game. After some unsuccessful corners, Silly scored from a beautiful first time shot to put us level. Page 12 FELIX, October 17, 1980\n\n"

The Caravan ENTS gig should have\nbeen on November 16, not November 9.\nLast Week's Issue\nAs you must have realised by now, the ruse\nabout the folding machine breaking down\nwas merely an excuse to attempt to smash\nthe record for the largest FELIX collation\nstaff. If you enjoyed yourself last week, why\nnot come in every Thursday night for even\nmore fun. Well done, we're all very pleased\nwith you . . . and not a single letter of\ncomplaint!\nThe Man Responsible\nI asked John Passmore what he felt about\nhis Freshers' Ball; he said he could say\nnothing but that he was sorry. He said the\nsame at Union Council on Monday and in\ntoday's 'Preversions' column.\nI was most surprised that the matter was\ntreated so lightly at Council. While it is all\nwell and good for John to 'do the decent\nthing' and apologise for his cock-up, I feel\nthat this can be no excuse. Mr Passmore has\njust thrown FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS worth of Union money down the drain (PG\nGroup, for instance, have only this amount\nallocated for the entire year); DOESN'T ANYONE MIND?\nSo C 'mon Council, stop patting John on\nthe back for being so frank and honest about\nhis failings; he should write a full report of\nthe incident so that the situation may be\navoided in the future.\nNew Feature\nYou will notice inside an article called\n\"Soapbox\". While the letters page offers the\nopportunity for anyone to express their\nviews, I felt that it would be a good idea to\nencourage authors to explore their topics\nmore fully than the space constraints of the\nletters page will allow (i.e.a maximum of one\ncolumn per letter). So, the ball is in your\ncourt, articles should occupy no more than a page and be double spaced.

Last week he explained\nit to me, with his customary enthusiasm.\n\"Take your telephone number, for instance: 57388,\" he said, waving\nhis hands about. \"You arrange the digits first in descending then\nascending order and subtract the two, giving a new five digit number.\nIn your case this is 88753 minus 35788, that is 52965.\"\n\"How does this fit in with obscene phone calls?\" I asked.\n\"Well, obviously, it's very beneficial for an obscene phone caller to\nreceive obscene calls himself.\"\n\"Or herself,\" I put in, trying not to sound flippant. Wodge gave me a pained look and continued.\n\"Provided we can persuade all obscene phone callers to scramble\ntheir telephone numbers in the way I 've just explained, and then make\nall their calls to the number they get by this process, and provided all\nthese obscene phone rs have suitable telephone numbers in the first\nplace, they will each receive highly therapeutic lewdness from one of\nthe others in the network.\"\n\"Ingenious, but it has a drawback,\" I remarked, after some thought. '\n\"Even in a town like this where telephone numbers are five digits long,\nand may start with an 0, the number of obscene phone callers on your\nsystem will be at most \"\nHow many?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me c/o FELIX Office by\nTuesday noon, please.

ALL ENQUIRIES TO THE RESIDENCE OFFICE, ROOM161,S HER FIELD Bojo says\n'Cough up!'\nA t11o 'clock on a cold Saturday\nmorning, four RCS clowns were\nto be seen outside Harrods forlornly shaking collecting tins\nat passers-by. However, half an\nhour later, the RCS Exec, and Co., in full regalia, complete with J ez arrived, thus swelling\nthe numbers to at least twenty.\nThen, the Exec, having brought\na box of eggs and two cans of\nlemon-and-lime shaving cream\nwith them, battle commenced. Tactics for the extraction of\nmoney ranged from the mildly\nabusive approach, i.e.\" if you've\ngot a Harrods bag you must\nhave a lot of money\" to the\nchance for shoppers offspring( on reception of a sizeable parental donation) to throw a custard in Steve Tyson's face.\nOne Bill D uro die proved parti-cula rly adept at the former method \u2014 showing ability to\nattack not only English shop ers, but also French and German ones \u2014 much to the amazement\nof the surrounding members of\nRCS. The major problem of the\nday was that nearly all of the\nentrances and exits were closely guarded by people collecting for ' Multiple Sclerosis'\nwith the added advantage of badges and it seemed that the\naverage Harrod's shopper preferred to possess a little yellow\nsticker than the chance to throw\ncustard pies in the faces of RCS 'clowns'.\nHowever, accolades go to\nRick Jones( Maths1) who collected \u00a3 2 3 . 9 7 and to Bill D uro die for effort.

It was agreed that Council cannot do this, and that it must be taken to anU GM, where the bye-laws can\nbe changed. Fiona Sinclair argued\nth tIC WA must change. The in quo racy she said was related to\nthe disenchantment of most members. Miss Edm and s replied that\nwithin, and that actions such as\nthe President's resignation and\nthe movement of the I CW A Lounge seriously jeo pardi se its\nfuture.\nPete Stevens, the Union Welfare Officer, agreed to take\nthe quorum problem to the next\nICU GM on behalf of I CW A.

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nComplaints\nthreaten\nnew hall\nTHE EXEC and Residence Committee have received complaints this week from two Ennismore Gardens residents on\nbehalf of the Knightsbridge Residents Association.\nDon Munro, Senior Warden and Chairman of the Residence\nCommittee, has told FELIX that the extent of the complaints\nwere\" very sweeping\". The ladies brought up a number of\ncomplaints to Don Munro and Rae Snee on Monday, mainly\nconcerning noise from Southside\nand Linstead.\nThe meeting didn't start too\nwell; one of the ladies is quoted\nas saying: \" We are not going to\nbelieve anything you say because\nyou've told us nothing but lies\nin the past\".\nThe ladies went so far as to\nsuggest that the heating in the\nhalls needs serious investigation\nas windows are often left wide\nopen in winter with stereos blaring out over the mews. The incident that sparked off the latest\nseries of complaints was Link III, an electric Jazz band which\nperformed in Stan's on Wednesday, October7, although Jazz Club say this was no louder than usual.\nDon Munro has said that complaints should not be taken\nlightly as they prejudice the\nchances of getting planning permission for a further hall next to Linstead. He suggests\nthat serious thought should be\ngiven to the staging of bands in\nStan's, and the complaints procedure should be tightened\nup.\nIt is understood that a couple\nof years ago, the Mayfair Residents Association succeeded in\nbringing a legal action against\nthe Dorchester Ballroom which\nresulted in its closure.\nFRESHERS' BALLS UP\nTHE FRESHERS' Concert on Saturday, October 11, made a loss of approximately \u00a3500. The\nmaximum estimate of the audience was about forty, though the headline band, No Dice,\nbrought a guest list of twelve. Significantly more than half the IC students present at the gig\nwalked out after Nigel Mazlyn-Jones finished. Only nine people had paid their \u00a32 to enter by\n8:00pm. John Passmore, the man responsible, was In the Union Bar at the time. When asked\nwhat could be done about the low attendance, he answered: \"I don't know what to do ... I think I 'll resign\".\nDave Gayor romps home\nas Guilds Pressy\nDave Gayer was triumphantly ratified as President,, as Guilds held\ntheir Election U GM on Wednesday lunchtime. Dave Wo llar d was\nalso ratified as this year'sH JT. These elections, for which both\ncandidates were unopposed were held due to both the President and\nHJ T failing last summer's exams. There was a good turn out and business was quickly and efficiently until the time came for the\nformality of the candidates speeches. As this point in the\nproceedings, half way through Dave Gayer's speech, the lights went\nout, air horns blasted, extinguishers sprayed in all directions, and a party of RCS men, trained at a secret camp somewhere near\nSouthside, burst in, to attempt to steal Spanner and Bolt. After a few minutes chase they were repulsed and Spanner and Bolt were\nextracted from under a pile of hefty Guilds men. With order restored, both candidates were duly ratified and everyone then\nretired in triumph to the Queens.\nMike F urmston, the ENTS Chairman, made a spot decision to reduce the admission fee, to zero, in a last\nditch attempt to boost the\nattendance.S oIC Union made a loss on the concert,\nconsisting of \u00a3325 fee to No Dice; \u00a380 to Nigel Maz lyn Jones; \u00a350 to com per e Brian\nCook man; \u00a3i5 to doormen\nand, of course, the cost of\npublicity and the statutory\ndrinks for the band. The fiasco was org in ally to\nhave been the first ever IC Fresher s' Ball, featuring a concert, a disco, food and\ndrink, as opposed to a straight\ngig. John Passmore was the\nman responsible for the initial idea, soon after taking\noffice. He asked ENTS to\nbook bands for October ll,and the bands were booked.\nThen, only two weeks before\nthe beginning of term, Mike F urmston, alarmed by the\napparent lack of organisation,\nsuggested to Mr Passmore that the event should be\ntrimmed down to a simple\nconcert. The idea was rejected. On Tuesday, October7, Dave Wheatley, the Union' Publicity Officer, was given\nthe details of the event, and told to design some posters.\nUp until then, he explained,\nhe had been assuming ENTS had done, or were doing the\npublicity, as he had not been\ntold anything about the event. ENTS, of course, were\nassuming the Union were going to do the publicity, for\nthe same reason. No arrange-Continued on page 3.\nNo. 563 Friday, October 17,1980 Free!\n\n"

Team: Aver il Horton, Cathy Goss ley, Claire Bundy, Caroline Brown, Shirley Course, Dana Clarke, Jan Clarke, Carol Thomas, Alison Coates, Jill Shack lock, and Debra Mendes. The other two goals were scored by Carol; one followed pass from Silly, the other came after a determined attack by Dana which took her straight through the oppositions defence. U LU7a side, Sun Oct 12, Motspur Park\nLADIES' TEAM were unable to emulate last\nyear's success in this tournament. We came fifth in our section; lost two games, drew three and won one.

Caroline Broun\nSailing\nLAST weekend members of IC Sailing Club competed in the Firefly Inland Championships and Open Meeting at Welsh Harp, which attracted an entry of32 boats. On Saturday, live IC boats were on the water in strong and gusty conditions which resulted in many mishaps. James Baxter suffered gear failure early on, whilst Dave Cul shaw and Simon All port capsized. Colin Murray survived two laps, then capsized when in sixth place, whilst Nick A j dari an proved to\nbe a master in the conditions and finished in second place. In the second race, Nick was again holding second place but capsized, and the only finisher amongst the IC boats was James Baxter, who capsized. On Sunday the wind was light to moderate, but remained variable. Race three saw James and Nick well up the fleet, but Nick hit a mark when lying third and finished well down. James finished seventh. Race four got\nof falter two false starts and James again finished seventh. The last race started well for IC with Colin, James and Nick arriving on the first mark in the leading group. Colin moved up to third place at the end of the first lap, but lost out on a wind shift, and dropped back to ninth. James, meanwhile, took advantage of the s hilt and pulled up to finish third. The l our best results in the inland championships were: James Baxter with M Young husband as crew(4 th) and Nick A j dari an. with A Friend as crew (12th). The best results at the opening meeting were: James Baxter(5 th): Nick A j dari an(13 th); Colin Murray, with( fill Butler as crew(18 th) and Simon All port, with Jim Redman as crew (25th). Cross Country\nTHE FIRST' rate of this season, over our home course at Richmond Park was well attended with fifteen runners from IC amongst a total field of over Fifty.\nThe day started smoothly with everyone turning upon time \u2014 including the coach driver, and we arrived at the park in plenty ol time for the start at 3 o' clock. The race was won by Felt en stein from UC. The IC team was led by Mark Pickard finishing fourth followed by Mark Thwaite s(13 th), Steve Kirk(15 th), Chris Smith(16 th) and Gary Long hurst(22 nd). These were closely followed by a succession of both old and new club members, no doubt suffering from a lazy summer. The winning team overall was UC just beating Imperial College(2 nd), London School of Economics(3 rd) and Surrey(4 th). As usual not everyone managed to find their way around the course, with two people getting lost. Fortunately they turned up just as\nthe coach was leaving making a search party unnecessary. The next race is tomorrow afternoon at\nHampstead Heath \u2014 University College Relay6 by2 miles. Anyone is welcome to run and we shall be meeting at South Kensington tube station at 1 : 0 0 pm.

Orienteering\nTHE ORIENTEERING CLUB took part in its first event of the year last Sunday, held at\nBox Hill in Surrey. The day was fine and there were a large number of fresher staking part, so many that we needed two minibuses! The area, as its name suggests, is quite steep, and, by the end of the courses, most people( especially me!) were feeling the strain of having gone up and down too many hills!\nMost of the fresher s competed on the C course, which was4 km, everyone finished, and especially good times were recorded by Philip Bo stock and( Joan Ste nberg. Ken Warren had a good run and managed to win the B course, while Alan Parker had a reasonable run on the A course. A goodtime was had by all and we look forward to the next event this Sunday. Andy Maynard\nTable Tennis\nWELCOME to all those who have joined this\nyear( there are almost a hundred of you) and especially to thelema lc members who have made this club less male dominant.

If you have any suggestions and queries concerning the club, please do not hesitate to\ncontact an v of us.\nSince the beginning of the term, we have had a number of matches and we are thankful to those enthusiastic players who took part. On October1, I CV team brought the first\nvictory of the year when they played Sarah Siddons. They won seven sets Out of a total of nine. Congratulations. IC II played IC III on October2. The final\n\u2022 score was63, with three sets to Robin Mille vw an, two to Andy Ty e and one to Gary Etheridge. I CV met Texaco II on October7. Although, Tho won three sets, the final score\nwas 3-6.\nOn October7 ICI met Gains ford III. The final score was63 with two sets each to P Rutherford, KL a khan andR Miller. The final score was63 when IC II met Exiles4 on October10. John Blount won two sets, Andy Cowling, three and Phil Miller, one. For those interested, more reports will appear in this column soon. Suggestions are welcome. Cfii-I.i Pang\nBasketball\nFOR THE first time in the short history of the Basketball Club, we are to have a full size\ncourt in College, and I would like to thank on behalf of the club, the ACC Chairman and all others who have helped make it possible.\nThere is however, one slight hitch, namely that there are no baskets, but we hope to have them installed by the end of this week. The timetable for the\" New Volleyball Court\" was drawn up last week and we have its use for the following times: Monday between6:00 pm and10:00 pm; Thursday between12:30 pm and2:30 pm; and Saturday between5:30 pm and10:00 pm. The court is situated in the old chemistry building. For those of you not familiar with College, there will shortly be amap on the basketball noticeboard( in the main entrance to the Union Building) to explain its location. Ladies' Team\nWE have never in the past succeeded in getting a ladies' team together. There have always been a number of women training regularly though, and we would like to see\nthis enthusiasm rewarded. This will only be possible if we are able to get more ladies coming along, so if the idea of doing some regular exercise appeals to you( it doesn't matter if you have n't played before), then we want to see more of you f? Ed)\nInternal Competition\nFOLLOWING a suggestion we would like to\nintroduce this year a new internal basketball competition( possibly inter C CU) but this will only be possible if we get enough regular players. Referees\nWHEN the London Colleges League starts\nthis year( around the beginning of November) we will need qualified referees for out matches, so if you want to earn a quick pound( or five), then refereeing for IC is an easy\nway. In short, men, women, referees, if you' re interested, contact me through the Physics letter racks or just appear at the court with your kit on a Monday night.

    "content": "Council Report\nOn Monday, a Union Council meeting was held, from 6:20pm to 8:25pm during which several\nimportant matters arose.\nThe new games machines installed in the Lower Lounge had been emptied and \u00a3 6 6 0\ncollected over the last two weeks. This was a considerable\nincrease on last year when ICU dealt with Brig house Games Ltd. Rae Snee said she was very\nhappy about the arrangements\nwith the new company, Kossway\nAutomatics Ltd. The issue of sabbatical tax\nwas also raised. There was no\nopposition to the view that sabbatical officers should have\nan increase in pay to maintain\npresent levels after tax. Dr Ken Weale, the Honorary Treasurer,\nsaid that he had made rudimentary calculations of the tax\nliable, although there may be\nfurther complications such as\nthe tax year starting in April and sabbaticals finishing in June, or whether the Inland Revenue will attempt to tax last\nyear's Exec. It was finally decided to refer the issue to the\nFinance Committee.\nAnother matter referred to\nFinance Committee was the purchase of a further fifty pots,\nthe present stock being only 37.\nIt is, of course, traditional to\npresent members of the CC Us, ICU and other people who have\nhelped the Unions with engraved\npots. However, the quote by suppliers, M appin and Webb, was \u00a3 1 , 8 0 0 . The continuation of\ntradition was questioned and was referred to Finance Committee for further discussion.\nCouncil also approved in principle the visit by John Passmore to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. This institution has\nstrong links with the College and is celebrating its 1 2 5 th anniversary.\nThe motion before Council concentrated on the dilemma facing Greek students at Imperial.\nAlthough Greece becomes a full\nEEC member in January, Greek students are likely to be charged\nfull fees instead of the lower home fees for the last two terms.\nThe motion asked that the Dept of Education be asked to clarify\nthe situation.\nLaithwaite Weight Loss\nColin Palmer\nContinued from front page.\nment s were made for the booking\nof rooms other than the Concert\nHall, for the provision of food or\nfor the booking of a disco, hence\nthe final format was two bands\nand com per e in the Concert hall.\nOn the night, the only member\nof the Union Executive to turn up was John Passmore, who paid a fleeting visit before going on to\nRuth Hildebrand' s birthday party. The rest of the IC members\nin the audience were either with\nENTS or fans of Nigel Maz lyn Jones. This suggests that either\nthe publicity was nowe here near\nas extensive as it should have been\nor that everyone had seen No Dice before.\nGUILDS\nAPPENDIX\nAS WELL as ha vine to suffer\ninitiations, Dave Wool lard, the\nnew Guilds HJ T, felt slight pains\nin his stomach. He was admitted\nto St Stephens Hospital on Wednesday night and his a ppen dix was removed. Dave hoped to\nbe back next week.\nFire Escape\nInverts\nWork on the fire escape from the\nnew Islamic Society room has\nbeen stopped due to an objection\nfrom IC Radio. The original plan\nwas for Islamic Society to have a fire escape through IC Radio's Northside studio. Since IC Radio have about four thousand pounds\nworth of equipment in the studios,\nthey were understandably un happy about allowing free access\nto them. The new plan is for a fire\nescape in the same place, but\nopening only from the IC Radio side. Islamic Society will have a fire escape built via number8 Princes Gardens. IC Radio have\nnot ye at been told when the\nworkmen will be moving in, and\nas yet the room in which the door\nwill be made is still being used as a technical workshop. Dave Fuller,\nIC Radio Station Manager, said:\n\" Iam pleased that it poses no\nfurther security risk, but I'm upset\nat the loss of such a valuable work\narea\". The first Me chEng Soc meeting\nof the year was held on October9. Its main attraction was the\nspeaker, Prof Eric Laithwaite,\nthis alone attracted a massive\nturnout. In excess of 400 crammed into Me chEng220 to hear this\nacknowledged expert expound\non gyroscopes.\nThe lecture began with a series of anecdotes about his\nearly life. His manner belied a clever control of the audience\nand an ability to deftly deal with the attentions of photographer Colin Palmer.\nIn quick succession he quest i one d the use of vectors in dealing with such things as the\ncoriolis force and torque. He illuminated what could have been ob str use with a steady stream of provoking, but humo rous questions.\nHowever, he was in his element\nwhen talking about the properties\nof gyroscopes. This culminated\nin him lifting easily a massive\nspinning gyroscope that could not be lifted when motionless.\nThe questions of weight loss he\nraised were beyond the ken of\nmany present but he justly received prolonged applause.\nThere is a further comp lica tion, Greece does not recognise\nthe UK BSc degree. Students\ncoming here have to take an MSc to gain Greek recognition.\nThis complexity appeared to\nconfuse Phil Cole, a prospective\nExternal Affairs Officer ( Graham Greene opposes him at the next\nU GM election) was obviously\nbemused when asked: \" For us\nign or a mouses, what is a BSc?\" It was also pointed out at\nCouncil that in view of the Unions imposition of discretionary fines\non overdue posters, it was odd that aUG M poster should be up\neleven days after the event.\nTwo's Company\nThe President, John Passmore,\nhas announced that he and Michael Arthur have set up a company called Anglesond Ltd, on behalf of the Union; each\nwill own one share. This company will negotiate with landlords and rent property which they\nwill then lease to students. The point being that a company\npresents a more intimidating challenge if the landlord wishes\nto increase the rent or evict. The immediate cost was estimated to be \u00a3 9 5 which will be\nquickly recouped once the scheme gets underway.\nLST Prize\nJudith Turner of Microbiology2 was presented with first prize\nin the London Student Travel Competition. The prize was two\ntickets giving best travel anywhere in Europe. Miss Turner gave those tickets to a friend\nwho had helped her with the\ncompetition.\nTufts\nA reciprocal agreement has\nbeen reached between ICU and\nTufts Union. Though the Tufts\nCollege is situated in Mass., USA, they have a London branch that enables some students to take their third year\nhere. On Tuesday, members of\nTufts College, who will be\nliving in a hotel near Lex ham Gardens, were given an introduction to ICU. This took place\nin the UnionS CR; short talks\nwere given by John Passmore\nand Liz Lindsay with interjections by Pete Stevens and Nick Morton. There was a lengthy period of questions, where such pillars of College ethos as pub crawls, Rag, and tiddlywinks were explained.\nFELIX, October 17, 1980 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "HAMSOC - Ham at the Top IC YHA\nTHE MOMENT you have all been waiting (or\nhas arrived! The equipment is now installed in\nthe temporary shack on the top floor of the\nUnion Building. Operation is now possible on20 m and40 m( and80 m if you can manage to\nget the damned thing to tune up). Since the\narrangements are only temporary( we hope!) the only HF aerial up is our W3D ZZ, and so10m and15 m won't be available for the time\nbeing. However, to make tii e best of a bad job, negotiations are currently underway to have the Union Building mounted on a large rotator. Also available in the Shack is the FT221, which is\nnow functional again, though opinions vary as to\nwhether it is all it should be on FM. Unfortunately, the only aerial at present available is a' Slim Jim'. To get access to the equipment take your membership card along to the Welfare Centre, a few yards away from the Shack, and give it\nMichael Arthur, who has kindly agreed to let us\nuse his key. Please remember that the room is not actually ours, but belongs to the Rag Committee, who have agreed to let us share the use of their\nSanctum Sanctorum. This means that it is\nessential that the room is never left unlocked and that the key must be kept safe and returned to the Welfare Centre as soon as you have finished with it.\nUnfortunately, this does somewhat limit operating times, but 1 am hoping something can be worked out for weekends, etc.\nFinally, a few words to thank Dave L egg( G8WU F) for organising and controlling the splendid radio controlled pub crawl last Friday, even if 1 did end up not knowing where the hell\n1 was! Keep an eye( or preferably both) on the\nHam soc posters for details of the morse courses, lectures. etc. we have lined up. So I 'll\nsee you all in the Shack on Wednesday afternoon.73's from G8R RD Racy Excitement\nRally Round Up\nTHE GUILDS Motor Club Fresher s' Rally took place last weekend in Essex. Despite various hitches, the event was enjoyed by a large number of people, the prize giving was held last\nnight.\nThree prizes were provided by M otome ch s of\nBarnes, who sponsored the rally. The event was marred by an accident in which one of the\ncompetitors left the road whilst trying to negotiate a right hand bend. Due to the fact\nthat neither driver nor navigator was wearing a seat-belt, both sustained light injuries when they were thrown around inside the car. The organisation of the competition was further complicated by the breakdown of one of\nthe marshall s,on his way to a time control. Luk i ly, most of the competitors proceeded directly to the next control. The event consisted of about eighty miles of\ncom petit ve driving and started at 1 1 : 3 0 pm. The results of the rally were:1. S Cramp to n/J Ve dy, Mini,1275 GT2. G Mug ge ridge/D Thomas, Ford Escort Mexico3. KRoss it er/A Em mers on, Ford Capri Fast cars, fast reactions and left over Mooney breakfasts all helped to make Tuesday night in\nSouthside a night of excitement. Temperatures rose as the climax of the Scale c trix Race reached its peak. Model engines fueled with We the reds reached scaled up speeds of over200 mph. The girls in the Pit Crew had a hard night\nkeeping everything moving. Several cars had to be stripped down, but by the time the night\nwas over the track record had been broken many times.\nPics and story: Colin Palmer (who else!)\nConservative Society\nTHIS IS the largest and most active political\nsociety at College. After a good response at Fresher s' Fair over fifty people attended our Cheese and Wine Party when Mr Peter Brooke, MP was the guest\nspeaker.
