I\u2019ve\ngot a degree to finish\u201d. He dislikes\nthe fact that \u201cthe manager of ULU\nis controlled by the University of\nLondon, not the President of the\nUnion. I\u2019ve ended up as just a figurehead\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t think ULU \u201ccan continue in its present state, it has to\nbe managed by the elected officers\u201d.\nHe decided to resign as it would be\n\u201cthe best way to get his message\nacross\u201d.\nHalforty will not be replaced,\ninstead the role will be split between\nthe three remaining Deputy\nPresidents. He will now return to\nhis studies at Goldsmiths, after a\ntwo and a bit year Hiatus (he has\nalready held sabbatical positions at\nGoldsmiths, including President).\n\u201cI would shoot my gay son\u201d\nMeanwhile, in a separate matter,\nLuca Manfredi, ULU Council Chair,\nfaces the threat of a no confidence\nmotion as a result of homophobic\nremarks. Manfredi, who is also the\nGeneral Secretary of UCL, posted\nhis view of homosexuality and gay\nmarriage on a UCL Union web-notice board last November.\nMost notably he said that if a\nfuture son introduced him to his\nboyfriend he would \u201ctake out a big\ngun and make sure he [would] not\ndishonour my family\u201d.\nAt a recent ULU Council meeting,\nManfredi was asked to answer for\nhis previous comments. Manfredi\ntwice interrupted Jason Peachy, of\nthe ULU LGBT, who read out some\nof Manfredi\u2019s comments.\nManfredi has since issued an\napology in which he states \u201cThe\ncomments do not reflect my opinion in any way. I distance myself\nfrom them totally and uncondition-ally. The comments were intended\nfor use against one very restricted\ngroup of people.\u201d\nAlthough the comments were\nmade before he took up his current position speculation abounds\nthat a motion of no confidence will\nbe brought against him at the next\nULU Council meeting. In the interim Manfredi will not chair any ULU\nmeetings.\nManfredi also personally apologised to James Peachy for interrupting \u201cI pushed the \u2018override\u2019 button inappropriately at Council by\nmuting Jason. I reputed the matter\nof extreme importance and therefore thought it should be discussed\nat length [after council]. However,\nI acted in an entirely inappropriate\nway\u201d\nStewart Halforty, ULU president\ntold Felix, \u201cHe should apologise\nprofusely and prostrate himself in\nfront of Council\u201d. Sarah Khatib, ICU\nDeputy President (Education and\nWelfare) told Felix she thought \u201cit\nwas inappropriate to publish. He\nshould have apologised at the time,\nbut he has apologised now and that\nshould be fine. We can\u2019t dwell too\nmuch on the past\u201d. She did not comment as to how she would vote if a\nno confidence motion were brought\nat the next ULU council.\nRupert Neate\nEditor\nOn 7 November, the new \u2018Southside\nBar\u2019 will open in the ground floor\nof Linstead Hall. The new name\nhas not been confirmed. Ordinarily,\nthis would be an occasion to rejoice\n- a victory for the small people!\nHowever, what has not gone unnoticed is that somewhere the plans\nhave been changed. Anybody who\ncares to look inside the building site\nwill see the plans dictate not a bar,\nbut a licensed cafe with shop kiosk.\nThis suggests that the College has,\nonce again, gone behind the back of\nthe students.\nIn a meeting last term which\nincluded Tobias Dalton (Real Ale\nsociety chairman), former union\npresident Mustafa Arif, and College\nrepresentatives, it was agreed that\nthe ground floor of Linstead Hall\nbe the new home for what was the\nSouthside Bar. Plans were produced at the meeting, which clearly\nshowed a bar with the possibility\nof some food services, but no shop.\nAt the end of this meeting, College\nand student representatives were\nin unanimous agreement regarding these changes. Yet now, what\nis being built is far removed from\nthe bar that was originally agreed.\nThe College has gone back on its\nagreement between the end of last\nterm and now, clearly when the stu-dents, either ensconced in exams or\naway for the holidays, were unable\nto respond.\nDespite the Real Ale Society having campaigned tirelessly for \u2018a quiet\nalternative to the Union,\u2019 it seems\nthat the college has ordered a replica of da Vinci\u2019s. The whole purpose\nof the \u201cSave Our Southside\u201d campaign was to gain a replacement bar\nunlike those already provided - this\nthe petition clearly stated, and this\nwas therefore clearly demanded by\nthe members of Imperial College\nwho signed it. Once again, the\nCollege seems to think it knows us\nbetter than we do.\nFelix made enquiries regarding this discrepancy and received\nnumerous responses from a repre-sentative. However, in one response,\na mention is made of \u2018student representatives\u2019 having been at this\nmeeting, at which it is claimed plans\nfor the licensed cafe were agreed\n- If this alludes to the meeting\ninvolving Tobias Dalton et al, this\nis quite simply not true. In a later\nresponse, mention is made of the\nsingle \u2018elected student representative,\u2019 ie Mustafa Arif. This suggests\ntwo things - either that the College\nwishes to deny the agreement that\nwas made in the first meeting, or\nthat further meetings were held\nafter the agreement was made.\nIt should be noted that Mr Dalton\nwas called into this first meeting as\nan auxiliary student representative,\nsince certain College representatives said they did not trust Mr Arif\nto remain true to what he had said\nin a meeting held previously. In this\nearlier meeting, which included four\nmembers of the Real Ale Society\nand Mr Arif, it was agreed that there\nwas a need to replace the Southside\nBar, and that Mr Arif was to go forward with this to the College.\nA petition, signed by 4,000 members of Imperial College who made\nthe effort to sign during the exam\nperiod proves that a second bar was\nwanted.\nThe Real Ale Society\nLeader, page 17\nto students involved.\nWhen the question of the possibility of TfL\n\u2019s summary rejection\nof applications as a money making scheme was put to the Mayor\nof London, Ken Livingstone, at the\nLondon Assembly, he assured us\nthat \u201cTfL is not using the processing\nfee as a means of generating income\n\u2026 [upon rejection of an applica-tion] references are always given to\nthat part of the application which is\ndefective\u201d. He also mentioned that\nspecific complaints would be given\ncareful attention.\nMel Chapman (Tickets Initiatives\nManager for TfL) mentioned that\n\u201cover 300,000 applications are processed per annum\u201d and \u201cthe application process must be as quick\nand streamlined as possible\u201d, before\nmentioning that \u201cthe stamped signature differs quite significantly from\nthe sample supplied\u201d. However,\nafter complaints from the Registry\nOffice, he conceded that the applications had been wrongly refused,\nand agreed to issue Student Oyster/\nPhotocards against the rejected\napplications, adding the caveat that\nTfL \u201cwould not be liable for any\nadult rate fares paid by students in\nthe interim\u201d.\nULU President resigns whilst ULU Council Chair is likely to faces no\ncon\ufb01dence motion over homophobic comments\nLeader, page 17\nFelix Bar Night Tonight!\nIf you have contributed to Felix get your comeuppance - Free drinks!

What\ncan I do?\nYours,\nAngst\nDear Angst,\nWell you can start by breaking into\nthe hospital pharmacy and taking\na couple of sedatives: diazepam\nshould do it, to calm yourself down.\nFeeling better? Good; then listen:\nyou \u2018think\u2019 you\u2019re every bit as crazy\nas the patients - or did someone\ntell you? Now, I have a couple of\nmedic mates and they may not be\nthe most normal of people, but they\naren\u2019t insane and they managed\nto fail the mini mental psychiatry\ntests. They all also tend to be total\nhypochondriacs (constantly self\ndiagnosing). It seems that you also\nsuffer from the same problem. I\nmean, come on - unless you don\u2019t\ntend to binge drink and you\u2019ve\nrecently found yourself waking up in\nstrange places with no recollection\nof the night before and covered in\nmud, or have developed a habit\nof standing above your sleeping\nflatmates with a knife waiting\nfor them to wake up (or similar\nNorman Bates-like things), I really\ndon\u2019t think you have a problem.\nHere\u2019s what Miss C. orders: finish\nyour rotation; remember to take a\nbreather; and try avoid spending\nmore time than necessary in the\npsychiatry ward and I think you\u2019ll\nbe just fine.\nFatty Fat Fat\nDear Miss C.,\nI\u2019ve managed to put on 4Kg in the\npast 3 weeks. Not too sure whether\nit\u2019s the daily curries, general\ntakeaway meals or the boozy\nnights. Thing is, I didn\u2019t really\nmind - but now the other guys in\nhockey have started to mock me!\nWhat do you suggest?\nHugh Mongous\nDear Hugh Mongous,\nWell, your question isn\u2019t really\nthe hardest thing in the world to\nanswer! I\u2019m pretty sure that all of\nthe above are the cause of your\nincreased weight. Although to be\nfair, if all you\u2019ve been living off is\ntakeaway meals and alcohol, then\nI\u2019m impressed its only 4kg! My\nadvice: try and eat more healthily\nand lay off the lard. Did you not\nwatch super-size me? Cut down a\nbit on the booze as well, and that\u2019ll\nprobably help. However if neither\nof these are really the solution\nthat you\u2019re looking for then I\u2019d\njust exercise a bit more. A couple\nmore workout sessions etc. and the\nweight will be flying off and you\u2019ll\nbe back to your normal size. As for\nyour mates? Just challenge them\nto a drinking contest, it sounds\nlike you\u2019ve definitely had enough\npractice to drink them under the\ntable. If you choose the exercise\noption, then you\u2019ll soon be running\nlaps round them and then they\u2019ll be\nthe ones with red faced.\nI\u2019ve Got the Munchies\nDear Miss C,\nThe past two Fridays I\u2019ve eaten\nlunch with a girl I\u2019ve recently\nmet. I\u2019m pretty sure that she has\na boyfriend, but she never talks\nabout him around me. If I\u2019m\ninterested in dating her should I\nbring the subject of her boyfriend\nup? Is she not talking about him\nbecause she doesn\u2019t want to scare\noff a potential friend or because\nshe is interested in me? I\u2019d just\nlike to know what\u2019s on her mind.\nIs it ok to ask or will that make her\nuncomfortable?\nFeeling Hungry\nDear Feeling Hungry,\nYou want to know what\u2019s on her\nmind? Well the only way to do that is\nto ask her, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m an advice\ncolumnist sweetie, not a mind\nreader. Now normally it\u2019s the girls\nthat over-think the situation, but\nin this case you\u2019ve managed to top\nthat chart. You\u2019re eating lunch with\na friend, not planning a marriage.\nHave you thought that maybe\nas you don\u2019t know her boyfriend\nthere\u2019s no real reason for her to talk\nto you about it? The best thing is\nto stay friends and get to know her\nbetter, I\u2019m sorry but two lunches\ndon\u2019t count for anything! If she likes\nyou it will be more obvious! Girls\nreally aren\u2019t that complicated. If you\nwant to test the water, ask her out\nto another gathering with a group\nof mates, and just get to know her\nbetter on a personal level. Flirt with\nher, see if you get a reaction and\nwork from there! Just take it one\nstep at a time.\nOne Orgasm Too Far\nDear Miss C.,\nI had such a strong orgasm when\nhaving sex with my boyfriend that\nI pooed myself. Frankly, it was\ndisgusting. My boyfriend didn\u2019t say\na word, but he must be disgusted,\nmusn\u2019t he?What should I do?\nAshamed\nDear Ashamed,\nDon\u2019t worry, we all have moments\nwhen we let the moment take over.\nIf he really loves you he should\nrealise that you were just giving\nyour all to the moment. However, if\nthis happens again I would advice\nrefraining from anal sex. It could be\ndue to a medical condition, semi-latus rectum, but I suggest you go\nsee your doctor ASAP\n.\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHey guys.

    "content": "After weeks of voting, the\nConservative leader race has boiled\ndown to David Davis and David\nCameron, with Davis already panning massive tax cuts for families.\nThe vote will now go to all registered members of the Conservative\nparty, with a final result expected on\nDecember 6th.\nA US Senate commitee have reiterated claims that Respect MP\nGeorge Galloway (below) benefited\nfinancially from the UN\u2019s \u201cOil-forfood\u201d programme after a report was\nreleased containing new evidence.\nMr. Galloway has denied any wrongdoing claiming, \u201cThis is all a tissue\nof lies and a lie doesn\u2019t become a\ntruth through repetition\u201d.\nThe United Kingdon is gearing up\nfor a general smoking ban to be in\nplace for 2007, with Health Secretary\nPatricia Hewitt outlining a ban in all\npublic places in the governments\nnew health bill. All workplaces will\nbe covered by the ban, but pubs\nwhich do not serve food and private\nmembers clubs will be exempt from\nthe ban. Scotland, Northen Ireland\nand Wales will introduce tougher\nbans which will not include these\nexemptions.\nA fair deal for asylum?\n\u201cOne of the more\nunsettling adment-ments enables immigration officers to get\nbiometric information\nfrom passengers\u201d\nA week is a\nlong time\nin politics\npolitics politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNew plans for immigration reveal some unfair changes to the system\nAnalysis\nMatthew Hartfield\nPolitics Editor\nHome Secretary Charles Clarke has claimed the new measures are\ncompatible with human rights legislation\nwithout offical immigration status\nfor whatever reason; whether their\nstatus has expired or they haven\u2019t\nbeen given permission to work. Alex\nGask, a legal officer for the civil\nrights group Liberty, expressed\nhis concerns that this would worry\nprospective employers and lead to\ndiscrimination in an effort to keep\nwithin the law; although in this\nsame bill the Government stated\nthey will issue guidelines to prevent\nsuch discrimination when employing people.\nThe new asylum proposals will\nalso have an effect on students who\nwish to study in the UK. The new\nimmigration bill will abolish the right\nfor students to appeal if their visa is\nrejected. Since it was announced\nat the meeting that around a third\nof students who study in this country are from overseas (mainly in\nareas such as science, engineering\nand technology), this measure has\nthe potential to affect a significant\nfraction of the student population.\nDiana Warwick, the chief executive\nof Universities UK, discussed the\npoint that students who have their\nvisas rejected for trivial reasons\n(such as doubts over passing their\ncourse) will find themselves strand-ed, and cited the case of Sheffield\nUniversity, where nine out of ten\nrefusals are overturned before the\nofficial appeal process.\nI\nn recent years the issue of\nasylum and immigration has\nbecome something of a hot\npotato in politics; a topic which\nis constantly brought up and\nargued about, especially in the light\nof the war on terror and the more\nrecent terrorist attacks on London.\nAs has been regularly reported,\nthe Labour government have introduced a raft of measures to try\nand tighten immigration into the\nUK and to reduce the number of\nasylum seekers entering the coun-try; measures spurred on by various\nright wing newspapers. However, at\na recent House of Commons meeting discussing the Government\u2019s\nnew Immigration, Asylum and\nNationality Bill 2005, a number of\nthe recent and new plans were dis-cussed, some of which do raise a\nfew alarms.\nOne of the main points that was\nraised was a new section that was\nintroduced in the Treatment of\nClaimants Bill of last year, in which\nthe government were given powers\nto stop the benefits of failed asylum seekers, and there were even\nreports of threatening to remove\nthe children from their families, in\norder to encourage their departure.\nTim Finch, a speaker for the refugee council present at the meeting,\ndescribed these measures as, \u201ccruel\nand ineffective\u201d and criticized the\nGovernment for their feeling that,\n\u201casylum has to be legislated nonstop\u201d.\nThe Immigration, Asylum and\nNationality Bill will also outline new\nguidelines on employment of asylum seekers, introducing new penalties for those who employ those\nOne of the more unsettling\nadmentments to the original 1971\nact though is the provision to enable immigration officers to require\npassengers on travel transport to\nprovide biometric information, such\nas fingerprints and eye readings.\nThis seems to suggest that the\nGovernment are getting ready to\nroll out their identity card scheme\nbefore it\u2019s even cleared. Considering\nthe current kerfuffle over its current\ncost (the LSE produced a report\nstating that each ID card will cost\n\u00a3300 each to create) and the potential to create an Orwellian state\n(hysterically, it has been announced\nthat the planned ID cards are a\nbit like your supermarket reward\ncards, except that they\u2019ll be able to\nhave information on which countries you\u2019ve been to, where you\u2019ve\nhad a health check up and what your\ncurrent criminal record is, as well as\nthat your cat prefers Whiskers) this\nseems an almost underhand method\nto get the ID plan started.\nW\nhen someone says,\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward\nto taking my message\nright round the country\u201d, it is natural to\nassume that the message must be\nloud and clear, isn\u2019t it? Why is it then\nthat when David Cameron utters\nthese words, people buy it?\nThere really seems to be no clear\ncut message to take around, apart\nfrom a fresh faced smile, some\nsharp suited charisma and random\nbanter about hopes and dreams. A\nrecent Guardian/ICM poll showed\nthat he even has a 15 point lead over\nGordon Brown for being favoured as\nPrime Minister by floating voters.\nThe stagnant Cameron bandwagon\nOpinion\nAmmar Waraich\nDo experience and actual policies\nnot count for anything?\nTheToriesaredesperateforpower;\ndesperate enough to try anything;\ndesperate enough infact to favour\na main man who is being openly\ndescribed by the media (and who\ncan blame them) as nothing more\nthan Tony Blair in a blue disguise.\nIf Cameron\u2019s message is merely an\nambiguous Blair imitation, forgive\nme for not getting excited.\nAdmittedly though, putting the\nwooden David Davis (or even Liam\nFox) as head would only have successfully elected the loser of the\nnext general election. The only\nreal option that the Conservatives\nhad was Ken Clarke, a heavyweight\npolitical beast, and the only one who\ncould challenge New Labour. Some\nsuggested that it was slightly too late\nfor him and that he would have been\nthe ideal choice instead of Hague,\nIain Duncan-Smith or even Michael\nHoward, who was given a free run. In\nmy opinion though his One Nation,\npro European take on Conservatism\nwould have been healthy for the\npolitical world, stirring it enough to\ntake it in a fresh and constructive\ndirection. He was also the only man\nwho had the popularity and experience needed to modernise his party\ncredibly and effectively. The Tories,\nhowever, in their desperation blew\ntheir chances.\nWhat does that leave the country\nwith? It leaves us with a stagnant\npolitical scene with options that will\nresult in conditions not much different to what we have witnessed\nfor the past decade. There is a reason why voters are more apathetic\nthan ever before! Gordon Brown\nmay now be by far our best shot at\nthe next elections but in all honesty even that prospect is not one\nto rejoice over; unless he can really\ntake hold of his party and steer it\nin a totally new direction, where\ninitiatives like the so-called \u201cBig\nConversation\u201d or \u201cTough on Crime\u201d\nactually equate to something. Even\nif Cameron is someone who can\ninstigate this change, then all the\nhype and expectation will be justi-fied. However, chances of this happening are slim.\n\u201cPowers were given\nto stop their benefits\nand there were even\nreports of threatening\nto remove their children\u201d\n\u201cA recent Guardian\npoll shows that Cameron has a 15 point\nlead over Gordon\nBrown for being\nfavoured as Prime\nMinister\u201d\nPolitics\nFelix\nHave you got an\nopinion?\nIf you fancy\nseeing your name\nin print, email us\nat:\npolitics.felix\n@ic.ac.uk\n11\nfelix\nThursday 3 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Then they came for foxhunt-ers and I did not speak out because\nI was not a foxhunter. Then they\ncame for the smokers and I did\nnot speak out because I was not a\nsmoker. Then they came for me and\nthere was no one left to speak out\nfor me.\u201d\nThe above is a rather crude\nadaptation of a poem by Pastor\nMartin Niem\u00f6ller about the\ncomplicity of German intellectuals\nwith the Nazi\u2019s during their rise to\npower. An early supporter of Hitler,\nby 1934 he had come to oppose\nthe Nazis and by 1939 he was\nimprisoned by the state. This week\nsaw the proposal of a partial ban on\nsmoking in public houses, excluding\nprivate members clubs and pubs\nwhich do not serve food. As a\nnon-smoker and with no intention\nof working for a big tobacco\nconglomerate some people may\nfind it surprising that I am opposed\nto this measure. In common with\nsupporters of the ban, I too find\ntobacco smoke utterly repulsive.\nNo-one likes breathing in second\nhand smoke or coming home from\nthe pub and noticing that you smell\nlike an ashtray. Despite all these\nunpleasantries there is one group\nof people I have even greater\ndisdain for, the anti-smoking\nfascists.\nMost people don\u2019t like smoke\nbut this legislation is using a\nsledgehammer to crack a nut.\nSmokers throughout the country\ntake great pleasure relaxing\nover a pint accompanied by their\nobligatory weed. Lets put this\nproblem into perspective. Smokers\nare a mildly irritating group, not\na threat to national security. If\npeople dislike smoke-filled rooms\nthat much then they are free to\ntake themselves and their cash to\nan establishment which chooses\nto have a no-smoking policy. With\nan exodus of customers, publicans\nwould be forced by the market\ninto changing their ways. Seems\nsensible dosen\u2019t it? Unfortunately\nnot to some. Led by Nanny-inChief Patricia Hewitt, they have\nsummoned the courage to enforce\nyet another health fatwa on the\npoor, unlearned masses who are\nclearly too stupid and downtrodden\nto make their own decisions\nregarding their well-being.\nSuch illiberal methods against\nordinary people seem to be\naccepted by the country without\nproper discussion. Those who\nare against the new anti-terror\nmeasures always seem to have\nthe benefit of a nice, well-spoken\nman in a suit to make some obtuse\npoint about civil liberties every\ntime the government passes new\nlaws in an attempt to combat\nIslamic extremism. There is at\nleast a debate over the anti-terror\nlaws with opponents claiming that\nthey persecute British Muslims.\nWhen the same arguments are\nmade against the smoking and\nhunting bans such concerns don\u2019t\neven merit a grown-up response\nand in some cases only serves to\ninduce smug triumphalism from\nHalt the tyranny of the do-gooders!\nSir Richard next\ntime let us know\nahead of time.\nWe are not pawns\nin your uber-game of chess\n\u201c\nStephen Brown\nfelix\nFaculties reshuffled\nHow can College just up and do this\nwithout any consultation with the\nstudents? We are told all the time\nthat \u2018Imperial is first and foremost\nabout giving the students the best\npossible education\u2019.\nSurely then College should take\nthe views of the students into\naccount when planning something\nas drastic as a reorganisation of the\nfaculty system.\nI\u2019m glad to see Sameena\nMisbahuddin, Union President, is\ntaking such an active stance on this\nissue and look forward to what she\nmight report back from the Rector.\nKilian Frensch, President of ICU\nPhysical Sciences would like to\nsend a plea to Sir Richard - next\ntime let us know ahead of time. We\nare not pawns in your uber-game\nof chess.\nTravelcards\nTfL seem to have upped the\nstakes in the \u2018which Government\ndepartment can be the most\nbureaucratic competition\u2019. The\nsignature stamp which the registry\nhas been using is apparently\nsignificantly different to that which\nTfL have on record. Even though\nregistry have used the same stamp\nfor all students only some students\nhave experienced problems, how\ndoes that work?\nThe issue does, now, seem to have\nbeen resolved so hopefully all student can now take advantage of the\nreduced student fares.\nSouthside\nAll at Felix are severely\ndisappointed with the change\nof plans for Southside bar.

For example,\nthey are not so keen to preach to us\nthe results of research published by\nSwedish toxicologist Robert Nilsson\nwho concluded that breathing\nin passive smoke for a year is\nequivalent to smoking between one\nand two cigarettes annually, hardly\na lung-threatening amount. Instead\nthey hysterically shriek that our\nnations smokers are selfishly\npushing us all in to an early grave,\nin order to further their own holier-than-thou agenda.\nOn a more personal level,\nsmokers aren\u2019t really a bad bunch.\nI\u2019d rather go to the pub with my\nsmoker-friends and enjoy their\ncompany despite their foul habit.\nIt detracts from a good night\nout if several of your cohorts are\nconstantly having to leave the\nbuilding to feed their addiction.\nInhaling a few noxious fumes is\nfar more preferable than having\nthe group dynamics of my evening\ncontinuously upset by this or worse\nstill, spend time in the company of\nsome goody two-shoes who\u2019s life\nbeen spent either in the gym or\nmunching on organic rice cakes.\nI\u2019d choose an evening with the\nconsiderably more interesting,\nalbeit addicted and afflicted group\nof smokers anytime. Why should\na bunch of out of touch, politically\ncorrect Guardianistas who probably\nwake up every morning to a yoga\nsession and go to bed with 3 feet of\nwater tubing jammed up their arse\naffect how I socialise with a much\nvalued minority of my friends?\nWhen faced with the choice\nbetween serving food or allowing\nsmoking many establishments will\nchoose the latter which is what\nadvocates of the ban hope. Our own\nunion offers a far more sensible\npolicy by prohibiting smoking\nin certain areas when food is\nserved. In my view this means that\neveryone wins. People like myself\ncan enjoy their food in a smoke-free environment and those who\nfancy a puff are not inconvenienced\ntoo much. This is admirable as\nbeing a private members club,\nunder the new proposals we are\nstill free to do whatever the hell\nwe like with regards to allowing/\nprohibiting smoking in union bars.\nLets make sure the on campus\nhealth nazis don\u2019t have another\nopportunity to impose draconian\nrestrictions on our smoking friends.\nIf they succeed in this they\u2019ll only\nresurface later to try and prohibit\nsomething else they don\u2019t like about\nthose of us who muddle thorough\nlife without the assistance of a high\nhorse.\n\n"

If it had not been for the\nobligatory medic cheating, the score\ncould easily have reached double,\nperhaps even treble figures.\nIn now traditional Sevenths fash-ion, we shot out of the blocks and\nfor the third game in a row found\nourselves in the fortunate position\nof being 3-0 up within 20 minutes.\nThe first came within seconds of\nthe kick off as Ian\u2019s corner was\ntapped in at the back post by a mys-tifyingly unmarked Jarlath. The\nsecond goal provided an answer to\nthe eternal question: what happens\nwhen comedy defending meets comedy attacking? Answer: A comedy\ngoal of course! Jack was played in\nfrom the right wing. A goal seemed\na certainty until he produced a complete air-shot (a dummy? Whatever\nyou say Jack\u2026) the medics failed\nto clear, however, and tiny, tiny Pas\nwas on hand to belt the ball over\nthe flailing keeper and into the goal.\nInspirational leader Sam was on\nhand to score his third in as many\ngames with a powerful drive from\nthe edge of the box after more good\nwork by Ian to make it 3-0 to the 7\u2019s.\nAt about this stage the clearly\njealous medics realised that they\nhad no chance of winning the game\nand started trying to break the sevenths players\u2019 wonderfully skilful\nlegs (perhaps they wanted to perform some kind of leg transplant\noperation so that they could have\na good football team aswell? Who\nknows\u2026). These dirty tactics only\nproceeded to inspire the sevenths to\nnew levels of absolute amazingness\nand the score reached 5-0 before\nhalf time. First Pas won the ball in\nmidfield and fed Jarlath, who having\nspotted that the goalie was sporting\na pair of the very latest crisp-packet\nhands (all the rage in this year\u2019s\nULU football leagues) proceeded to\ndrill the ball straight through them.\nJack assures me that he scored the\n5th goal, which was bundled over\nthe line after a goal mouth scram-ble. I, however, have decided that it\nwas an own goal. Unlucky son.\nThe medics combination of being\nwell rubbish and cheating made\nthe half time team talk easy (just\nlike the game, ha!) and the flow\nof goals continued after the break.\nPas got his second after collecting a\nrebound from his own shot and then\ncompleted his hat-trick with a beautiful left-footed finish from a wonderful through ball from Alan to make\nthe score IC Sevenths 7 \u2013 Cheating\nmedics 0. Easy! Easy! Easy! That\nis what the thousands of fans not\npresent at Harlington would have\nbeen chanting if they both existed\nand had turned up.\nJack made the score 8-0 with a\nheader from Paul\u2019s free kick but\nthe cheating medics disallowed it\nfor a \u201cmarginal offside\u201d\u2026Well\u2026\nwhatever, it was still 7-0. Somehow\nconvinced that they hadn\u2019t already\ncheated enough, the medics then\nturned down the most blatant penalty ever after Ian beat 3 men and\nnutmegged a fourth before being\nkicked over in the box. I guess the\nmedics thought 0-7 was a pretty\nrespectable score, but 0-8 could not\nbe allowed at any cost.\nThe focus now fell on the defence,\nwho have been outstanding all season so far. Paul, Mo, Adie, Wongy\nand Alan wanted a clean sheet\nSO badly\u2026but they didn\u2019t get one\nbecause they let the medics score\nafter Ario got lobbed again. Was\nthis the most miraculous comeback\never? Could the medics do it? 7\ngoals in 10 minutes? Don\u2019t be stu-pid. The game finished 7-1. IC were\ndelighted with the win, the medics\nwere delighted with the amount of\ncheating that they did. Everyone\u2019s\na winner.\nMens Football\nICSM 4ths 1\nImperial College 7ths 7\nSam Styles\nAfter being disappointed on not getting to play the first scheduled match\nof the season due to a much delayed\nforfeit by Goldsmiths College,\nthe Thirds went on to play their\nfirst ULU match last Wednesday.\nMaking an extra effort to meet early,\nensuring we reached Potters Bar on\ntime\u2026due to our somewhat sh*te\norienteering skills.\n\u201cSnatching a quick\nlead within the first\nfew centres, the\nmatch got off to a\ngreat start\u201d\nOn arriving at Potters Bar station\nthe Royal Vet\u2019s were there wait-ing, and after a long drive through\nthe country roads in a car that felt\nlike it was about to break-down any\nminute we made it to the courts\nin good time. Snatching a quick\nlead within the first few centres, the\nmatch got off to a great start\u2026all\nthe girls were in the zone and had\nthe determination to prove to Jade\nwe could win (a smart motivational\ntactic from the captain after a declaration that she thought we\u2019d lose).\nAfter the first half we were still\nholding onto a fab 8-6 lead, and still\nhad the energy to keep the game in\nour hands. With the Vets looking\ntired and getting sloppy Imperial\nshot in there keeping possession of\nthe ball and playing out the game at\nour own pace.

IC 2nds\nwere about to find out, taking on\nthe second team from a university\nthat boasts 34,000 students. IC 2nds\nentered the game with their three\nprevious matches featuring a mind-boggling total of 22 goals, lending the\nsuggestion that goals were to be the\norder of the day. However, with over\nhalf of these goals in the \u2018Against\u2019\ncolumn the defence was beginning\nto get a reputation of being more\nlike a colander than a sieve, perhaps\neven a net.\nBarely five minutes had passed\nand it was already nil-nil, although\nIC 2nds were looking better value\nfor their nil. Left-winger Chris\nParrott was dribbling a lot and the\nopposition didn\u2019t like it \u2013 you could\nsee it on their faces.\nAK made a darting run and\naided by a somewhat clumsy tack-le, collapsed in the D like a pack\nof cards with acute angina. Up\nstepped Parrott who matter-of-factly curled the ball into the bot-tom-left corner of the goal. It was\nwell executed, on the contrary to the\nLondon Met\u2019s shoot-to-score policy.\nCommendably, they were hitting the\ntarget but unfortunately for them,\nthey had come across the wrong\nman. James Haugh in the IC nets\nwas impregnable.\nThe fan didn\u2019t have much longer to wait until the second goal,\nwhich uncannily saw centre back\nMilad Toolabi running with the ball\nnear the opposition corner flag and\nwhipping in a superb cross. It was\nstylishly converted by Gready who\nwheeled away in obvious delight.\nThe start of the final 45 saw IC\ncamped in their own half defending an almost endless succession\nof boring throw-ins, but the back\nfour stayed awake, held firm and\nconceded nothing. The London Met\ncaptain may have pulled off one of\nhis players at half time but even\nthis could not serve to inspire his\ndefenders to rise to the occasion\nand be more solid in the second\nhalf. London Met needed a cutting\nedge as badly as Bill Oddie, whereas\nIC looked threatening with lots of\npossession in Met\u2019s half. This was\nrewarded when IC were awarded a\npenalty for a handball, and it was\nGready who coolly slotted the ball\ninto the bottom-left. Gready was\nthe obvious choice for the pen once\nAK had ruled himself out of the running having just been nobbled by his\nopposite number, who may or may\nnot have been deaf. By this stage\nGready\u2019s ankle injury was starting\nto cause problems and AK still had\na fresh pair of legs up his sleeve\nin the way of Perry, so the obvious\nstraight-swap was made. The third\ngoal caused Met to collapse like\nPaul Robinson\u2019s stock in Ramsay\nStreet when it was revealed that he\nwas a master embezzler and was\nknobbing everybody\u2019s missuses.\nTheir heads had dropped and their\nknuckles had really begun to drag.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before D.A.L. slotted\nhome the fourth and Perry completed the rout with a well finished\nrun on goal.\nSo to answer the question: London\nMet 2nds can be treated as seriously\nas well\u2026Harchester United.\nMens Football\nImperial College 2nds 5\nLondon Met 2nds 0\nAndrew Kosinski\nEasy victory for IC second XI The Imperial College Sailing Club\nattended a competition at the Welsh\nHarp reservoir at Wembley last\nweekend.

This year\u2019s team included 2\nnew members and only one member of last year\u2019s team, but despite\nthe lack of experience of the Welsh\nHarp\u2019s quirky conditions, we were\nconfident it wouldn\u2019t show.\n\u201cthe team have to\nbe congratulated for\ntheir efforts\u201d\nThe competition comprised of four\nraces, two either side of lunch. The\nwind conditions were light meaning that mistakes that were made\nwere punished more severely than\nusual. The slow speed of the racing,\nallowed the least experienced of the\nteam time to take in the intricacies\nof competitive racing and as the day\nwent on, the performances lifted.\nThe wind also lifted as the day went\non and this change of conditions\nallowed the team a bit of variety in\ntheir sailing. The day finished with\nthe Imperial College teams in 9th,\n10th, and 12th. While not as impressive as our last visit, the team have\nto be congratulated for their efforts\nwhen you consider the lack of training we have had since the start of\nterm.\nAs a club we will next be competing at Loughborough on the 3rd/4th\nDecember. The sailing is not the\nonly fun part, as the competition\nhas a reputation for its impressive\npost-sailing social events.

Read on to \ufb01nd out how you can get free tickets...\nS\ntay or sway, don\u2019t come\nand go like you do\u2026\nI remember the first\nromantic comedy I ever\nlaid eyes upon. It was\nWhile you were sleeping, starring\nthe funny girl-next-door Sandra\nBullock and the sensitive Mr. Nice\nguy, Bill Pullman. It\u2019s one of my\nfavourites, despite the fact that it\nis just a story of a girl who meets a\nboy, girl likes boy, girl screws it up\nbut love (as usual) proves itself to be\ninvincible and they live happily ever\nafter. How original - right?\nRomantic comedies are a funny\nsort of thing, don\u2019t you think?\nThey\u2019re predictable and it\u2019s difficult to tell one from the other.\nNevertheless, if the lines at the cinema for Elizabethtown are any indi-cation, romantic comedies is still\nthe talk-of-the-town. Perhaps it\u2019s the\nfeel-good factor, or it might just be\nthe amazingly cute lead actor. There\nare numerous reasons why romantic comedies still dominate the DVD\nrentals charts. However, in this sea\nof infinite choices, how do we tell the\nbad from the good?\nLet\u2019s start off by listing the really bad romantic comedies. The\nfirst that comes to mind must be\nIntolerable Cruelty. Surprised? How\ncan anyone mess up a combination\nof George Clooney and Catherine\nZeta Jones? Apparently, they can\nand they did. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\nZorro\u2019s leading lady\u2019s complete lack\nof emotion or the horribly un-engag-ing script, but basically, at the end of\nit, Intolerable Cruelty simply did not\nmake it to my must-buy-DVDs list.\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Sweet\nNovember! Having starred together\nin the thriller The Devil\u2019s Advocate,\nI was appalled by the complete lack\nof chemistry between Keanu Reeves\nand Charlize Theron. It\u2019s a pitiful\nstory of a boy who meets a girl, falls\nfor girl but girl meets an unfair and\nearly demise. Boohoo - but the script\nitself is the real sob story. Keanu\nReeves is just not a man for romantic comedies (A walk in the clouds\nshould have been a good indication)\nand if there\u2019s one thing that makes\nClassic Romantic Comedies\n1. Before Sunrise\nStarring Ethan Hawke, in his much better days (before he started\nsporting the oh-so-ugly heroine addict look), this movie is both\nromantic, sexy and realistic. It\u2019s been a while since the movie was\nreleased, but they still have it on DVD.\n2. Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary\nAlright, I admit I hate her stupid-desperado lifestyle but you have to\ngive the movie credit for the really cute Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.\nPlus, it\u2019s really funny and it\u2019s a classic watch-or-die movie.\n3. How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\nSeriously, the title is such a joke, but it\u2019s one of Kate Hudson\u2019s best - at\nleast before she ventured into L\n\u2019Affaire (tres horrible!). It starrs the\noh-so-cute Matthew McCoughney and that by itself is reason\nenough to watch the silly film!\n4. My Big Fat Greek Wedding\nPerhaps people might consider this more of a family movie than a\ngirly romantic comedy. However, it\u2019s still a feel-good film and who\nwouldn\u2019t love the whole ugly-duckling and swan idea!\n5. Boys & Girls\nSeriously, I am such a teen flick addict! But this is one of the best...\nStarring the likes of Freddie Prinze Jr. (who is Adonis in my book)\nit\u2019s funny and it\u2019s sweet. And it\u2019s actually based on students in\ncollege, so how close to home can you get?!\n\u201c...There is Sandra\nBullock telling her\nin-laws the story of\nher one-testicled\nfianc\u00e9 in While You\nWere Sleeping and\nthen there was Kate\nHudson with her\nPhotoshop-assembled album of her\nfuture children in\nHow to get rid of a\nguy in 10 days...\u201d\na bad romantic comedy, it\u2019s a leading man with less than one facial\nexpression.\nWhat makes Love Actually better than the infamous ones listed\nabove? Firstly, it\u2019s filmed in London\nand that might appeal to the minority of us who love the dreary grey-skied mornings. I mean, Bridget\nJones\u2019 Diary was a real success\ntoo! Secondly, it has an engaging\nscript and it makes the audience\ncare about the people in the story.\nI mean, if the romantic comedy\ndoesn\u2019t make you cry when they\nbreak up and smile when they get\ntogether again, what\u2019s the point\nbehind it?\nAnd then there are the minuscule\ngags that give the story its cute\nand quirky edge. There is Sandra\nBullock telling her in-laws the\nstory of her one-testicled fianc\u00e9 in\nWhile You Were Sleeping and then\nthere was Kate Hudson with her\nPhotoshop-assembled album of her\nfuture children in How to get rid of\na guy in 10 days. These gags help\nus to see the human-aspect of the\ncharacters and endear them to us.\nIt might seem easy but then again,\nthere are some movies that overdo\nit and end up as a comedy instead of\na romantic comedy. Must love dogs\nwas one of them.\nThis time around, TwentiethCentury Fox is at it again with the\nnew romantic comedy In Her Shoes.\nStarring Cameron Diaz, this movie\nis entertainment-guaranteed. In line\nwith its release on 11 November,\nthanks to Twentieth-Century Fox,\nFelix is giving one lucky reader four\ntickets to watch In Her Shoes and a\nbloody fantastic goodie bag (includ-ing In Her Shoes bag and beanies)!\nLike it? If you do, just write to me\nat film.felix@ic.ac.uk and tell me\nthe author of the book which In Her\nShoes was based upon.\nAnyway, that\u2019s my take on romantic comedies. I believe guys hate\nthem (but I\u2019ve been proven wrong\non many occasions) and girls love\nthem. Nevertheless, it\u2019s not going\nto die out soon and who cares, it\u2019s\na good way to unwind on a rainy\nSaturday evening. Now, it\u2019s my time\nto go. Ciao!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\n9\nfelix\nThursday 3rd November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

The Anglo-Dutch\ngroup\u2019s profits increased 30% to\n$5.8bn (\u00a33.3bn).\nProfits at BP increased 27 per\ncent to $5.3bn (\u00a33.9bn). The company has had a mixed year so far,\nafter the explosion at the Texas City\noil refinery that killed 15 employees\nthe company has signed deals opening up key emerging markets in\nboth China and India, and remains\nthe only major oil company to have\nsignificant operations in Russia.\nExxon Mobil corp. \u2013 the world\u2019s largest listed energy company \u2013 last\nweek unveiled record-breaking third\nquarter net profit of $9.9bn (\u00a36.6bn).\nThe figure, which represents a 75\nper cent increase on the same period last year is the highest ever in\nUS corporate history. Despite closures at Gulf coast refining facilities\nas a result of Hurricane Katrina,\nthe company faired better than its\npeers, putting the cost of the hurricane at $45m; equivalent to 50,000\nbopd (barrels of oil per day).\nOil reached a record nominal high of $70.85 per barrel after\nHurricane Katrina crippled oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. OPEC\nreleased an extra 2 million barrels\nof oil per day onto world markets in\nSeptember, but with refiners in need\nof high quality, easy to refine crude,\nthe markets took little notice of the\nextra supplies of low quality crude,\nand prices have remained above\n$60 per barrel since.

BP has\nhinted at possible job cuts in recent\ndays, in its refining, marketing and\nlubricants divisions in an effort to\ncut costs.\nThe biggest problem for the oil\nmajors is where to spend the cash.\nThe obvious option is to invest it\nin new oil fields, but profit margins\nneed to be protected incase the oil\nprice falls dramtically. Option two\nis investing in renewables, such as\nwind and solar; but these lack the\nreturns provided by oil and gas.\nOption three is acquisitions \u2013 using\nthe cash to purchase smaller rivals,\nUS President George W Bush last\nweek nominated Ben Bernanke\nas his preferred candidate for the\nrole of chairman of the US Federal\nReserve, when the current chairman \u2013 Alan Greenspan \u2013 retires in\nFebruary.\nThe role of the \u201cFed\u201d chairman\ninvolves setting interest rates, which\ndetermine the cost of borrowing on\nboth a domestic level (e.g. mortgag-es) and at a corporate level. Interest\nrates are a key tool, allowing central bankers to control economic\ngrowth and consumer inflation. Alan\nGreenspan has held the post of Fed\nchairman since 1987, and his is seen\nas somewhat of a legend on Wall\nStreet for his ability to control the\nmarkets.\nOn the US current account deficit,\nwhich has reached $800bn or 6per\ncent of GDP\n, Mr Bernanke suggested that US economic policy had a\nlimited role and that the deficit was\nthe result of too little investment\nand too much saving on a global\nscale \u2013 and that it would correct\nitself in due course. Others disagree\nhowever, arguing than by raising\ninterest rates more aggressively;\nconsumer demand would fall and\nrein in the deficit. Low cost goods\nfrom China have kept prices of consumer goods low in recent years,\nbut if Chinas growth was to slow,\nthis supply of cheap imports would\nfall, pushing up inflation.\nBernanke is currently chairman\nof the president\u2019s council of economic advisers, was previously a\nProffessorofEconomicsatPrinceton\nUniversity. Like Mr Greenspan, Mr\nBernanke favours focusing efforts\non controlling consumer price infla-tion, rather than assets bubbles\n\u2013 such as the dotcom boom, and\npotentially the current US house\nprice bubble. In recent years the\nFed has become more transparent\n\u2013 releasing minutes of its meetings\nand revealing its perferred inflation\nrange of 1-2 per cent.\nWhere Mr Greenspan and Mr\nBernanke differ on policy, is whether\nor not to commit to specific targets\nfor managing inflation, such as the\nEurozone and UK where inflation is\ntargeted a less than 2 per cent. By\noffering specific targets Bernanke\nwould offer the markets a greater\ndegree of transparentcy and reduce\nthe volatility that is associated with\nthe uncertainty of interest rate\nmovements. The downside of giving\nspecific targets however, is that they\ncan leave little room to maneover if\nother factors emerge\nIf US economic growth were to fall,\nMr Benankes biggest problem could\nbe the phenomenon of \u201cstagflation\u201d\nwhere interest rate policy is torn\nbetween low interest rates to stimulate a stagnant economy, and higher\ninterest rates to control inflationary pressures. Whatever the global\neconomy holds for Mr Bernanke in\nthe next few years, Mr Greenspan\nhas set a tough precedent that will\nbe hard to follow.\nThe price of gold has rallied this\nyear, over concerns that record oil\nprices will fuel inflation. Gold is used\nby investors as a store of wealth to\nbeat inflation. The yellow metal is\ntipped to reach $500 per troy oz in\n2006 and reached an 18 year high\nof $480.25 per troy oz earlier this\nmonth. The bond market however\nhas shown no signs of worries over\ninflation, as core and consumer\ninflation approach 2.5 and 3 per cent\nrespectively.\nAt the time of going to press the\nmarkets are aniticpating the fed to\nraise interest rates for the 12 successive time, bringing them to 4\nper cent\nbut the target companies will be\nvery expensive in the high oil price\nenvironment.\nThe fourth and most probable\noption is for companies to \u201cbuyback\u201d their own shares, and increasing the value of remaining shares,\nbecause profits are divided between\nfewer shares.\nThe Treasury may have another\nideas however, as it considers raising royalties on North Sea oil revenues from the current 40%, in order\nto bolster public finances\nSimon Jones\nWelcome to the latest addition\nto Felix \u2013 the Business section.\nBy way of an introduction my\nname is Simon Jones, I have\nworked for Shell Exploration\nand for BP\n, and I am currently\nin my second year of Geology\nin the RSM, and my interests,\nor rather my expertise are in\nthe oil and mining sectors.\nLegend has it that \u201chalf of\nImperial end up working down\nthe road in the city\u201d, and although\nthis may not be entirely true, the\nbusiness section is the perfect\nplace for all you millionaires-to-be to kick-off your career in\nfinance.\nMany people simply don\u2019t have\ntime to read the Financial Times\non a regular basis, or are baffled\nby all the jargon and phrases such\nas \u201ccredit derivative swaps\u201d.

    "content": "Praying for a space\nDear Felix,\nFriday 21 October saw the Islamic\nsociety once again forced to hold\n\u201cJumah\u201d or Friday Prayers on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn due to the fact\nthat all the places, such as the\nGreat Hall, that could hold the\napproximately 300 students and\nstaff of the Islamic society were\nbooked. This situation has arisen\nas previously explained in Felix\n(issue 1331) due to the closure of\nSouthside, where prayers had been\nheld for the past 20 years in the\nUnion controlled gym.\nMany have asked about using\nnearby mosques. Unfortunately\nthe closest mosques that conduct\nFriday congregational prayers\nare thirty minutes away from\ncollege. It would be impossible for\nstudents or staff to attend without\nmissing valuable lecture time or\nwork. Along with this, the closest\nmosques are already at full capacity\nand cannot absorb the 300 students\nand staff.\nWhat also must be remembered\nis that the Friday congregational\nprayers are an obligation on all\nMuslims. It is performed by all\nMuslims whether they consider\nthemselves devout or rarely identify\nthemselves as Muslims. It is the\n\u2018lowest common denominator\u2019 of all\nprayers.\nAs the situation stands now the\nIslamic society are allowed to book\nrooms (such as the Great Hall)\nas any other club or society. This\nmeans that the venue may have\nto change from week to week.\nAnyone who is part of or helps to\nrun any society would know that\nit is hard enough to tell members\nof a change of venue without the\nadded difficulty of having around\n300 people to inform. Also as the\npast two weeks have shown there\nmay not be any available space to\nconduct communal prayers.\nThe request is a simple one\nto college: a permanent room of\nsufficient size to hold the Friday\ncongregational prayers during the\nlunch time. This is not a request\nfor a new service but rather\na continuation of a previously\nestablished one.\nThere may be complaints about\nthe prayers being held on Queen\u2019s\nLawn but the Islamic society are\njust trying to find a place to pray.\nKian Sing Low\nWelfare Campaigns Officer\nDear Felix,\nLast Friday, I picked up a flyer\nfrom the Islamic society during\ntheir open air prayers on Queen\u2019s\nLetters to the editor\nStar Letter\nOffensive Cartoon\nDear Editor,\nI found the cartoon printed next to\neditorial in the last issue of Felix\n(issue 1332) rather offensive.\nIf there\u2019s anything worse than a\nracist taunt to an ordinary Muslim,\nit\u2019s being associated with terrorism\nand extremism.\nWhat you may not realise is that\nreligious Muslims, particularly\nthose living in Arab states,\nhave long been subject to state-orchestrated terror: in Iraq under\nSaddam, in Syria under Hafez AlAssad and in Egypt under Nasser,\nto mention but a few.\nI\u2019m not particularly against Felix\nturning into a tabloid, but let\u2019s not\nadopt The Sun\u2019s poor journalistic\nstandards. The beard is often worn\nby religious Muslims: it is not a sign\nof extremism. And just to note,\nthe 9/11 hijacker Atta was clean-shaven.\nYours Faithfully,\nHabib Abdur-Rahman\nSAS, Felix\u2019s editoral cartoonist,\nresponds:\nIt has been brought to my attention\nthat some students have found the\ncartoon I drew in last week\u2019s issue of\nFelix offensive. Firstly, I would like\nto apologise since that was not my\nintention. Being a Muslim student\nmyself, I drew it with the intention\nof ridiculing the idea that Muslim\nstudents at Imperial could ever be\nconsidered as having extremist\nbeliefs. In reterospect, I could have\nexpressed my ideas more clearly\nso as to avoid such misunderstad-ings. I would like to apologise again,\nand will endeavour to make sure\nany future cartoons are clearly\nstructured so as to avoid causing\noffence.\nThat said, all ethinic groups are\nstereotyped whether it be Muslims\nwith beards or the French with\nstriped shirts and rings of garlic.\nCartoons are exaggerated and they\nplay on the stereotype because\nthat is what people associate the\nrelevant ethnic group with. While\nI understand that many Muslims\nwish to change the image of Islam\nin wake of recent events, I somehow\ndoubt a cartoon wearing a sign saying \u2018non-stereotyped Muslim\u2019 would\nbe appreciated either.\nYours Faithfully,\nSAS\nThe author of the \u2018star\u2019 letter\nreceived each week will win\n\u00a310\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nLawn. They claim that they are\nforced to cause inconvenience for\nfellow students and staff because\nICL would not provide them with\na room for their obligations as\nMuslims. I completely agree with\nICL\n\u2019s position that the College\nis secular and should therefore\nnot provide space for communal\nworship. Religion has nothing to do\nwith ICL, irrespective of whether\nMuslim, Christian or Hindu.\nThe flyer claimed that the closest\nmosque would be too far away to be\nconvenient and instead gather on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn. Well if it is so important to them, Hyde Park is just\nminutes walk away with plenty of\npublic space to hold a congregation.\nI assume the Queen\u2019s Lawn gathering is designed to elbow College into\nproviding a room (free of charge?)\nthereby breaking the secular tradition of the College. As an atheist, I\nam happy not to be bombarded with\nreligious beliefs during my lunch\nbreak around Queen\u2019s Lawn.\nJ Schumacher\nDep of Biological sciences SAF\nDear Editor,\nImperial College should give full\nsupport to the Muslims that want\nto pray on Queen\u2019s lawn. This is\nbecause any decision forced by mob\naction can\u2019t fail to be better than a\nreasoned, rational one.\nTo house the Muslim prayer\ncrowds, a dedicated prayer\nplatform pointing directly at Mecca\nshould be commissioned.\nThe people praying on Queen\u2019s\nLawn are doing their best when\nthey align their bowing towards the\nSir Alexander Fleming building.\nTheir best is not good enough.\nThe Earth is not flat. A sloping\nplatform to angle their prayers\nstraight towards the Ka\u2019bah should\nbe constructed. According to my\ncalculations, it should point down\nfrom the horizontal in London at an\nangle of 21 degrees 28 minutes to\ncompensate for the sphericality of\nthe Earth.\nWithout such a slope, their prayer\nrays just leave the globe at a\ntangent and uselessly drift off into\nspace. Plans should be drawn up\nstraight away.\nName and Deptartment supplied\nFelix\nDear Felix,\nJust taking this opportunity to say\nthat Felix is much better this year.\nGrabbing headlines, fab photos, col-our, information on a wide range of\nissues at your finger tips. Very well\ndone to all involved, you have created a very dynamic read.\nState of the medical\nschool\nDear Felix,\nI feel that Imperial\u2019s position as the\nbest medical school in Britain (fol-lowed by the delightful Hull) is not\nso much a testament to the scientific calibre of its students but their\nlinguistic calibre.\nI\u2019m sitting here procrastinating\nin the medic computer room (with\nhalf my year) as the lecture I\u2019m\nsupposed to be in goes on next door.\nThis has nothing to do with not\nwanting to learn, it\u2019s simply because\nthe level of English required to lecture at Imperial is equivalent to the\nstandard expected in a McDonald\u2019s\nentrance exam. I strongly feel that\nthe study of medicine should not be\nmade even more complicated by the\nadditional requirement of deciphering the incomprehensible piffle that\ndribbles out of their mouth.\nIn many schools there is outrage\nwhen the ratio of teachers to students exceeds 1:30. In our medical\nschool the ratio of lecturers to students is 1:360 - too many, in fact, to\nbe held in our lecture theatre. This\nmakes learning harder than it need\nbe, so to have lecturers who speak\nvery poor English is a further problem that really should be avoided.\nConcerned 2nd year student,\nFaculty of medicine.\n19\nfelix\nThursday 3 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nGet your views heard\nsend Felix a letter\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nblind date\nLooking\nfor Love?\nOr just a\nfree\ndinner?\nemail blinddate.felix@imperial.ac.uk with\nsome info about you, and we'll set you up\non a date to remember.\nTechnician Required\nGlendower Prep School in South Kensington is looking\nfor an IT technician for a part time vacancy (approx 8\nhours a week).

Shred your bank statement and receipts before binning\nthem \u2013 these scum are happy to rifle\nthrough your garbage. Check your\naccounts regularly for any unusual\ntransactions and, last but not least,\nalways check the full identity of callers if they ask you for any personal\ninformation or passwords. Basically,\nthey are everywhere \u2013 on the streets,\non the phone and online!\nB\nSE, foot-and-mouth dis-ease, SARS and, most\nrecently, bird flu. Every\nyear there is a new lead\nstory in the newspapers that makes the world seem\nas though it were becoming a riskier place to live. On the evening of\n27 October, a panel at the Royal\nInstitution of Great Britain led a\ndiscussion on the issue of how risk\nshould be assessed and interpolat-ed, especially by the government\nand the media.\n\u201cWe now live in a culture that\nhas a proclivity to exaggerate everything,\u201d said Bill Durodi\u00e9, professor\nat Cranfield University.\nThe remainder of the panel consisted of Elliot Morley MP\n, Minister\nof State for Climate Change and\nEnvironment; Mary Riddell, a\ncolumnist for The Observer; and\nMatthew Wright, a Channel 5 pre-senter. Sheena McDonald, an award-winning broadcast journalist and\npresenter, chaired the discussion.\nMost of the panel agreed that both\nthe media and the government had\nprobably exaggerated the risk of\nbird flu. According to these journalists and politicians, there was\nno guarantee that the virus would\nmutate to become capable of per-son-to-person infection.\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried about dying in\na car crash to tell you the truth,\u201d\nRisky business\nWright said.\nMorley was quick to point out, how-ever, that as a government official\nyou have to \u201cthink the unthinkable\u201d\nin order to protect the people. The\ngovernment has to pay attention to\nthe \u2018what-ifs\u2019 \u2013 making contingency\nplans and informing the public of\nthe danger \u2013 because, as shown with\nBSE, there is more danger in not\ntaking the risk seriously enough.\nBut why does fear seem to be\nmore prevalent now than in the\npast? \u201cWhy does the world seem like\na riskier place to live?\u201d an audience\nmember asked.\nAccording to Durodi\u00e9, people now\nlive in a state of isolation. Traditional\nnetworks are breaking down, leaving people to face the world on their\nown. It\u2019s the difference between the\nfeelings you have walking down a\ndark street in the middle of the night\nwith a group of friends and the feelings you have in the same situation\nwhen you are by yourself, Durodi\u00e9\nsaid.\nAmber Bauer attends a debate on the portrayal of risk.\nRiddell said that a declining belief\nin God and an afterlife was partially\nresponsible. Many people\u2019s focus\nhas shifted to the here and now. Life\nhas become even more precious\nbecause many believe that there is\nnothing after death.\nRiddell also said that people have\nbegun to place more trust in reason and knowledge. Fear builds up\nwhere there is a lack of facts.\nIn the old days religion offered\nthe answers, Wright said. Now, scientists are seen as being able to\nprovide the answers to the big ques-tions. However, they don\u2019t always\nhave the answers, as in the case of\nbird flu.\nThe lack of substantial facts surrounding the possible bird flu pandemic has caused a problem in the\nmedia, according to Riddell. There\nis really no \u201cobjective truth\u201d to\nreport. Most of the stories are based\non guesswork.\nThus, according to Durodi\u00e9, the\ngovernment, the media and the public have been lulled into \u201cworstcase speculation,\u201d the majority of\ndebates centering on vaccines and\ngovernment preparedness.\nNo consensus was reached on how\nrisk should be communicated by\nboth the media and the government.\nHowever, Riddell said that in her\nexperience, \u201cThe greater the fuss,\nthe smaller the risk \u2013 eventually.\u201d\nDear Felix,\nAfter reading your article\n\u201cIntestinal Worm Medicine\u201d I\nwas rather disheartened by the\nflippant attitude towards aller-gies. Allergies are not just a case\nof sneezing in the pollen season\nor around animals, I suffer from\nasthma, eczema and hay fever\nand, as with me, often these\nallergies are a way of life. For\ninstance, I must be careful which\nsoap powders I use as they can\ncause my skin to itch uncontrolla-bly, certain shower cr\u00e8mes make\nmy skin unbearably tight (so\nmuch so that I need to shower\nagain with different soap), some\nsoaps and moisturisers make the\nskin on my hands so dry it can\ncrack and bleed. As I am sure\nyou can see this is more extreme\nthan the perceived \u2018sniffles\u2019 associated with allergies! The article\nonly further served to highlight\nhow little most people truly know\nabout conditions such as asthma.\nMost people\u2019s idea of asthma\nis little children wheezing after\nrunning around too much in the\nplayground however as a severe\nasthmatic I can assure you this is\nnot the case. There are reasons\nas to why the NHS categorises\nasthma in the chronic illness\nbracket along with illnesses such\nas diabetes. For example, not\nonly are asthmatics more prone\nto illnesses such as flu but asthma has its own inherent dangers;\none person dies every seven\nhours of asthma in the UK and\nthe Asthma Campaign estimates\nthat 90% of these deaths are\npreventable. What most people\ndon\u2019t realise is that the majority of asthmatics that die are in\nfact often not chronic but young\nstudents (often at university)\nwho only hold a blue inhaler and\ntake no preventative medicine.\nThis is because mild asthmatics\noften underestimate the severity\nof an attack and do not call an\nambulance in time (most deaths\noccur within 2 hours of an attack\nbeginning!).\nPersonally, as a sufferer of\nchronic asthma, I find my life\nseverely restricted and not just\nfrom being unable to go deep\nsea diving! My main \u2018trigger\u2019 is\ncigarette smoke, hence I must\nhold my breath every time I pass\na smoker in the street and cannot\nenjoy entertainment at the union,\ngo to bars, clubs or restaurants\n(something I\u2019m not convinced\nthe Equal Opportunities Officer\nwill dare attempt to rectify). If I\nshould brave a smoky environment I run the risk of ending\nthe night with a trip to hospital\nfollowed by a week off uni and at\nthe very least will be in severe\nagony and unable to breathe. So\nin answer to the question \u2018What\nwould it take for you to deliberately infect yourself with a dose\nof intestinal worm eggs?\u2019 I would\nsay that I would love to be part\nof that trial if it meant that I\ncould, even for one week, spend\nan evening in the union with my\nfriends or walk down the road\nunafraid of it inadvertently leading to a hospital; small liberties\nthat so many students here take\nfor granted.\nNicola Hopkins\nKathryn Lougheed replies:\nI am extremely sorry for any\noffence my article on intestinal\nworms and allergy may have\ncaused to serious allergy suf-ferers. I can assure you that my\nintention was never to ridicule\nthose who find their day to day\nlife affected by allergy. I completely understand how serious\nallergic conditions including\nasthma can be. The aim of the\narticle, however, was not to\neducate the readers of the paper\nabout allergic disease, although\nI do agree that most of us, me\nincluded, know very little about\nthese conditions.\nInstead I attempted to provide\na light-hearted look at how the\ninitially shocking suggestion of\ninfecting yourself with intestinal worms could in fact have\nsome serious benefits to allergy\nsufferers. While some of the\nreaders of this article, like you,\nwill undoubtedly find their lives\nhampered by allergic disease,\nmost will consider hay fever and\nother minor allergies little more\nthan an annoyance. Although\nthis opinion is obviously not\nshared by you, the point of the\narticle was not to rectify the\ncommon misconceptions about\nallergy explained in your letter. I\nhad hoped that the article would\ninstead make readers think\nabout intestinal worms in a new\nlight, while at the same time letting allergy sufferers know about\nsome research that may soon be\nof benefit to them.\nThe more serious allergy sufferers among the Felix readers\nshould take the fact that this\nresearch is underway as an\nindication that many scientists\ntake their conditions very seriously indeed even if the majority\nof the public do not fully understand the severity of the prob-lem. At the time of writing the\noriginal article, the Nottingham\nbased group of scientists were\nstill trying to recruit hay fever\nand asthma sufferers for their\ntrial. I can provide anyone interested in volunteering with their\nphone number.\n5\nfelix\nThursday 3 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nLetters\n\u201cWe now live in a\nculture that has a\nproclivity to exaggerate\neverything,\u201d according\nto Prof Bill Durodi\u00e9\n\u201cOver 60% of the\naudience thought\nshopping and banking\non the internet were\nnot safe.\u201d\nCyber-crime: beware of what your\ncomputer knows about you.\nAny views or comments\non the articles in the\nscience section?\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nFifteen years and countless raves\nlater, Britain\u2019s best-known munters\nreturn to the nation\u2019s conscience\nwith Their Law, a singles collection to showcase their best-loved\nmoments.\nLiam and the boys don\u2019t waste any\ntime in kicking things off. They\u2019re\nunafraid to make their presence\nfelt, using the full throttle sonic\nassault more commonly known as\nFirestarter to do so. This track is\nmind-blowing from the first to the fifteenth listen. It\u2019s contemporary; the\npugilistic Breathe is equally infectious and danceable, as is Smack\nMy Bitch Up with its rhythmic turns\nand menacing vocals driving the\ntrack with aplomb. So far so good\n\u2013 where\u2019s my variety meal?\nCue The Law and Out Of Space,\ntwo disparate and diverse tracks\nshowcasing the spirit of the Prodigy.\nExperimentalism. Where else can\nyou find an Arabic-inspired tribal\nbeat in the midst of robotic noi-secore and guitar licks on the same\ntrack? Out Of Space is especially\nlikeable, with its laidback reggae\ntune and ska-shuffle beats. One for\nthe dippier moments with the Xbox,\nI tell you.\nOther tracks of note include\nPoison, which sees the band on a\nragga tip, grizzly vocals and orchestral backing intact, before Aphex\nTwin gets paraphrasing in its vortex sound. Girls is equally potent,\nwith 80\u2019s inspired electropop replete\nwith synths and vocoders knocking\nStudio B over and out.\nSo far so good \u2013 what about the\nobligatory trip back in time? Liam\ncan\u2019t neglect us the way his hairy\nMancunian brother-in law can \u2013 he\u2019s\ngot talent for chrissakes! (His taste,\non the other hand, upon picking the\ntrashier Appleton sister is more\nquestionable.)\nWell. It\u2019s here, in fully glow-sticked\nglory. Tripping on acid and ecstasy\nis the only way one can convince\nthemselves that the likes of Charly,\nJericho and No Good are decent\ntracks in any way, shape or form.\nThey\u2019re techno-dirge in its worst,\near-splitting form. Spitfire and One\nLove are equally turgid. Voodoo\nPeople fares slightly better, since\nit\u2019s got a grimy yet seductive side\nto it, much in the way the orientally-inspired Hot Rice ends up closing\nthe show.\nThat\u2019s the way I\u2019d like to see it.\nClosed, over and out - a memorable listen that\u2019s not quite my cup\nof tea; I\u2019d stick to Fat Of The Land\nand Always Outnumbered, Never\nOutgunned if experimentalism and\ntechno-wizardry floats your boat.\nAge before beauty can be a wonderful thing; I\u2019m so glad XL Records\nare aware that experience breeds\nmasterpieces.\nSajini Wijetilleka\nOh yes, oh yes. It\u2019s finally here!\nThe quintet from Glasgow that is\nEl Presidente are releasing their\nself-titled debut album. I must say\nthat I have been anticipating this\nfor some time now, and as those\nof you who have been associated\nwith the AMS in any shape or form\nwill know, is where the president\u2019s\nt-shirt comes from, so we\u2019d expect\nhim to be a fan also... maybe (I\u2019m\nnot so sure \u2013 ed.). Since becoming\naware of their (increasing) presence\nat the start of this year, my interest\nhas grown and became cemented\nwhen I had the surprise pleasure of\nseeing them play live; I can testify\nthat they sounded unstoppable.\nIf there is one thing about the\nsongs on this album, that is their\ncatchiness and familiarity. Each one\nwas easily recognised after only one\nhearing five months prior. I guarantee that the majority of readers\nwill know at least one of their songs\nwithout being aware of it. How to\ndescribe their sound? It\u2019s difficult.\nAs you go through the album, you\u2019ll\nencounter pop, rock, funk and disco\nin all kinds of glorious combina-tions.\nIt opens thunderously with not\nless than four of El Pres\u2019s sin-gles, the first of which is Without\nYou, a song very reminiscent of\nCatatonia\u2019s better known stuff, but\nwith cheesier vocals and stronger\nbassline. This is a general feature\nof the album; the bassline pounds\nrelentlessly throughout, and is anything but monotone, while the vocals\nare doubled up on most of the songs\nand sing some of the cheesiest stuff\nyou will hear this year. It is all so\nwell put together though, that you\nwon\u2019t be ashamed to listen or even\nsing along to them; despite the most\nunlikely combinations of elements,\neverything works!\nThe real treats on the album only\ninclude one of the opening singles:\nRocket, as well as being hilariously\ntitled (I have always found something funny about guys and their love\nof rockets ever since that Simpsons\nepisode where Homer \u2018rides\u2019 one at\nthe US Air Force base) has a tune\nthat I can\u2019t quite guarantee I\u2019ve put\nmy finger on, but you know goddam-nit, it reminds me of the soundtrack\nto earlier Tekken games. The vocals\nare again doubled up, and the chorus is wonderfully simple \u201caaaaaaa-aaa-aa-aa-aaaa-aaa-aa-aa I\u2019m\ngonna block it, fly like a rocket\u201d.\nMarvellous!\nOld Times also has an addictive\nchorus with plenty of la-la-las, and is\nslightly cleaner than the other songs\n(except again, the bassline).\nFor me, however, now, the real killer on the album is Keep On Walking.\nIt starts with one of those eerie\nsynthetic chords straight out of a\nTechnicolor movie, before instantly\ngiving way to an incredibly crisp\nsounding distorted guitar. The progression of the song is very obvious;\nit is the most rock-like sounding of\nthe lot I reckon, but again the singing comes through and makes it that\nlittle bit different.\nAll in all I\u2019ve ended up getting the\nimpression that the singer has the\nability to contort his voice to suit any\nstyle he\u2019d like to do, when it doesn\u2019t\ncome naturally to him.\nWhat can I say to sum up? The\nsongs here demand attention; don\u2019t\ntry doing any intellectual activity while listening to these (not that\nmost us do any of that anyway). On\nthe other hand, if you have any tidy-ing/cleaning to do around all your\ndisgracefully messy domiciles, just\nstick this on and time will fly. You\njust can\u2019t sit still while this stuff is\non!\nIt\u2019s out this Monday guys and girls,\nand far be it from me to say that this\nalbum is a must-have, but it will put\na big smile on your face for at least\nthe rest of the week.\nSlobodan Radosavljevic\nSmack my... well, you know what\nIt\u2019s high time for a Prodigy retrospective, and it arrives as a singles collection, reminding us\nhow fear-inducing they used to be\nmusic music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Prodigy - the original munters, apparently.\n12\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 3 November 2005\nThe Prodigy\nTheir Law: The Singles 1990-2005\n(XL Recordings)\nHHHHI\nEl Presidente\nEl Presidente\n(BMG)\nHHHHI\nEl Presidente - man, this line-up looks like the front of a Next catalogue.\n\n"

    "content": "Ho-Yee put in another gritty showing for the RSM but unfortunately\ncouldn\u2019t shake her marker. With our\ngoalkeeper Kiran out for the next\nfew months for surgery (we all wish\nhim well and a speedy return) vice\ncaptain Rachel Kershaw stepped\ninto the keepers kickers at the last\nminute and was faced with a difficult\nchallenge from the Strollers\u2019 attack,\nand had to deal with an extremely\nwell executed p-flick. Not to mention\ngetting injured by her own captain\nin warm up, so thanks very much\nRach. Tom should also be thanked\nfor choosing to play for the RSM\nrather than one of the many other\nteams hankering after his skills. The\nsecond half was where the damage was done and the fitness levels were laid bare, three goals in\nrelatively quick succession saw the\ngame change very quickly. Chances\na plenty were had to even and turn\nthe score line around but a lack of\nmatch sharpness (and maybe certain hangovers) meant we couldn\u2019t\ncapitalise on them.\nThe post match festivities were\nevery bit as enjoyable as the match\nand involved many a downed pint\n(with extras of course) and much\nalcohol was imbibed. Tip for our\nman of the match: your bed will be\nmuch more comfortable than the\nfloor of the disabled toilets at the\nunion the next time you want a nap\nafter the game.\nsport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA big thank you goes out to the\nLondon Strollers, our victorious\nopponents who showed that sportsmanship is far from dead. They\u2019re a\ngreat bunch of people and a really\ngood club to play, so any other hockey people looking for mixed games\nshould certainly look them up on the\nweb. Thank you London Strollers.\nFirstly, the score was a little harsh\nI thought. Man of the Match was\nTim. Special mentions go to Tom\nand Rachel.\nIt\u2019s never nice to lose 5-2 but everyone enjoyed playing and it was\ngreat to see so many people turn\nup, its was a great social event. The\ngame started well with the teams\ntrading goals and keeping level with\neach other. Some fast runs from the\nStrollers\u2019 right forward kept Man\nof the Match Tim very busy. In fact\nif you looked at the game you\u2019d be\nhard pushed to put him in one posi-tion, as he was basically playing\nthe entire left hand side. Charles\nPurshouse made a brilliant debut\nfor the RSM in a holding centre\nmid role giving Mike and Tom the\nfreedom to cause problems for the\nstrollers\u2019 defence (how many goals\nwas it you missed Tom?). This being\na mixed event the ladies deserve a\nmention, Sarah and Susie putting\nin their usual high class performances gave the whole team a boost.\nSamuel Phillips\nRSM Hockey 2\nLondon Strollers 5\nBrown on Sport\nStephen Brown\nSports Editor\nFurther to last weeks column for all\nthose interested in the development\nof the facilities at Harlington I have\nsome progress to report. Sport and\nLeisure as you all know have worked\ntremendously hard over the past few\nyears to improve sports facilities for\nstaff and students. You only have to\nlook as far our new sports centre\nto see this. The money secured by\nthem for the new centre and the\nrefurbishment of off-campus gyms\nmeans that Imperial is one of the\nleading British Universities when it\ncomes to investment in sport. Not\nbad for an inner city campus!\nHaving spoken to the staff at\nSport and Leisure it turns out that\na major stumbling block when it\ncomes to erecting new floodlights\nis not just obtaining College funding but gaining planning permission from Hillingdon Council. The\nground at first sight appears that\nit is in the middle of nowhere, it\u2019s\nonly claim to fame being that it is\nsmack bang in the middle of a flight\npath out of Heathrow. It turns out\nthat there are a few houses from\nnearby Harlington village close to\nthe east boundary. Obviously the\nconcerns of residents must be taken\nin to account but a commonly held\nview is that surely a few additional\npylons aren\u2019t that much of an eye-sore? Floodlights occasionally used\nbefore bedtime shouldn\u2019t even register when you have planes flying\noverhead every few minutes seven\ndays a week? Perhaps our pragmatism is someone else\u2019s tyranny so\nthis would need to be examined in\ngreater depth.\nNot surprisingly support amongst\nstudents is unanimous. An unholy\nalliance of rugby, football and hockey clubs has formed over this issue.\nIC Hockey Captain Richard Bacon\nsums our position up very well, \u201cIf\nImperial is going to try to establish\nitself much more prominently in the\nsports department, it\u2019s going to have\nto invest some money in facilities\nlike better flood lights for everyone to encourage sports.\u201d Sport and\nLeisure again indicate that funding\nmay be available for such a project.\nThe College take great pride in the\nsuccess of our sports teams and\ntheir investment in our indoor facilities shows their commitment to our\nathletes. Harlington is an excellent\nfacility and it is important that we\nwork with College to ensure that it\nreaches its full potential. This will\nnot just be for our own benefit, but\nalso for subsequent generations of\nIC sportspeople.\nNow to close on a different matter.\nWe are now a month into term and\nI would like to thank all of you who\nhave contributed to Sports Felix.\nAs ever we are always looking for\nnew writers, especially amongst the\nniche sports who are neglected by\nmainstream coverage. Even just a\npiece telling readers more about\nyour sport we want to know. I feel\nurged to make this plea as I recognise that football match reports\nseem to be dominating this term.\nPerhaps I\u2019m a little too good at\nharanguing my fellow footballers in\nto churning out match reports.

    "content": "A still view of our dynamic world\nmedia media@imperial.ac.uk\nFew things, to me, can capture emotion better than photography. A thin\nwisp of cigarette smoke backlit by\nthe sun against a black industrial\nbackground; a child\u2019s face, captured\nin a moment of pure careless joy \u2013\nperhaps a reflection on the innocent\nhappiness left behind as we move\ninto adulthood; a barkless tree,\nexposed by wind, rain, sea spray\nand sand, side lit by a late afternoon\nsun against a dark sky.\nBlack and white, colour, digit-al, medium format, even camera\nphones nowadays, each one has an\nopportunity to capture these photos.\nWhat becomes important, whatever\nthe method used, is the photo itself.\nWednesday afternoon was a mixture of sun, blue sky and cloud.\nPhotosoc\u2019s trip along the Thames\nprovided a great chance to capture\nsome dramatic images, perhaps\ncombining picture-postcard shots of\nthe famous landmarks with more\nindividual, unique elements and\ncompositions. The weather couldn\u2019t\nhave been any better for high con-trast, dramatic photography. The\nfollowing Saturday, on to Borough\nMarket to experience a completely\ndifferent flavour of photography.\nYou can see just a couple of the\nresults above and more can be\nfound on our website - click on the\nGallery link.\nPhotosoc runs regular trips like\nthese throughout the year - both to\ntake photos and visit exhibitions, as\nwell as running lessons and providing a great place to meet other people with the same interests.\nTo find out more, visit our web-site: www.union.ic.ac.uk/photosoc or\ncome to one of our meetings (12-1pm\non Thursdays in the Media Common\nRoom, West Basement, Beit Quad).\nWe\u2019ll be organising a Photoshop lesson on 12th November, so do look at\nour website for more details.\nThere's more to Media Group than radio, television and newspapers. This week Peter Huthwaite tells us more about Photosoc, Imperial's photographic society.\nThames River by Raymond Ng Borough Market by Herwig Peters\nLast week saw one of the biggest\ntelevision events of the calendar\ndrop into the neighbourhood. The\nNational Television Awards landed\nin the Royal Albert Hall and both\nstoic tv and IC Radio were there to\ncover the star-studded event.\nstoic tv had several crews positioned along the red carpet to capture all of those drunken moments\nthe celebs would rather forget. Dave,\nformerly of The Matt & Dave Show,\ngot to interview the cast of The Bill\n\u2013 for the third year running (they\nmust be desperate for publicity!).\nMeanwhile Greg and Francesca,\nfrom stoic tv\u2019s brand new light entertainment show Foot and Mouth, got\nto interview a wide range of stars\nincluding Chris Tarrant, Sir Trevor\nMcDonald and in a national first, the\nonly interview in existence of Ant\nwithout Dec!

Third-generation solar\ncells, or Quantum Well Solar Cells\n(QWSCs), have the potential to be\ncheaper, more versatile and, as\nTibbits is preparing to demonstrate,\nmore efficient than any other single-junction solar cell in existence.\nThe basic principle of solar cells is\nthat when radiation hits a particular\nclass of material known as a semi-conductor, electrons in this material\nare excited and released from their\nnormal position, or \u2018hole\u2019. If you can\ntrap these electrons before they fall\ndown again, it is possible to store\nreach of the average homeowner,\ndespite potential savings in the long\nrun. But then, if the leader of our\ncountry believes this issue to be so\nimportant, where are the billions of\npounds of investment?\nProfessor Barnham believes there\nare several possible reasons for this,\nbut pinning them down is difficult\nand speculative. Investment is split\nbetween a wide range of technologies vying for attention. That\u2019s why\nhe is overseeing research designed\nto make solar the obvious choice.\nTom Tibbits, a former student of\nProfessor Barnham and now a consultant at the Centre for Integrated\nPhotonics, is currently working\ncharge and thus create a voltage,\nwhich generates electrical current.\nThird-generation solar cells have\nseveral advantages over earlier\ndesigns. They use semiconductor\nmaterial that allows the use of a\nwider range of radiation from the\nsun, reducing wasted energy. Also,\nbecause the active, light-absorbing\nregion is just 3 millionths of a metre\nthick, they can be manufactured into\nvery thin, and therefore cheap, lay-ers.\nQWSCs are formed by combining\nthe semiconducting layer with other\nlayers that provide the electrical\ncontacts and anti-reflective coat-ings. A concentrator is then used to\nfocus light from a wide area onto the\nactive region of the cell.\nThe efficiency of solar cells is\nmeasured by the ratio of energy\nthat hits the cell to the energy it\ngenerates. At present, the efficiency\nworld record is 27.6%, achieved by\nthe Spire Corporation back in 1991.\nTibbits is preparing to test his devices over the next few months and is\nconfident of breaking the 28% mark.\nThe danger is the ever-present\nthreat of being overtaken by competitors in Japan and the United\nStates, who are working on similar\nprojects with bigger budgets.\nOn a wider scale, however, this\nkind of competition is good news.\nMany ideas are around to develop\nthese devices into marketable prod-ucts. One possibility is the \u2018smartwindows\u2019, mentioned by Tony Blair.\nWindows incorporating material that\nis capable of both shielding us from\nsunlight and generating electricity from it will provide clean energy\nand reduce our need for it and stop\nthe insane practise of drawing the\nblinds to turn on the lights.\nWhile we still have light years\nto travel before we can ban fossil\nfuels, at least we have a direction. It\nappears that burning fossil fuels is\nnot a necessity in an industrialised\nsociety. There is a growing sentiment that we can and should keep\nhold of the freedoms that technology has given us, but the habitability of our planet must obviously\nbe a priority. If we are prepared to\ninvest both financially and politi-cally, it should be possible to live in\na developed world without changing\nthe make-up of our planet.\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial to become world\nleader in solar energy\nToby Ferenczi talks to Professor Barnham of the Experimental Solid\nState Group and reports on the potential of third-generation solar cells.\nscience\nNews in\nBrief\nTracing tRNA\u2019s dance\nScientists have employed the\nsixth fastest computer in the\nworld to simulate how the\nribosome accurately constructs\nproteins. Although the technical achievement has shattered\nthe previous record for biological simulation, ribosome specialists are wary of the study\u2019s\nconclusions. Because of limitations in computing power, the\nsimulation had to occur tens of\nmillions of times faster than it\noccurs naturally within the cell.\nBirds v. windmills battle\nheads to California courts\nTwo environmental groups\nhave gone to court with the\naim of shutting down the farm\nat Altamont Pass, CA for three\nmonths during the migration season to help protect\nred-tail hawks, golden eagles,\nand other raptors killed by\nthe mills. The nearly 6,000\nwindmills on the rolling hills of\nAltamont Pass, 60 miles east of\nSan Francisco, make up one of\nthe largest wind farms in the\ncountry.\nRed Planet comes close\nto Earth\nMars had a close encounter\nwith Earth, approaching to\nwithin 69.4 million km of our\nplanet in the early hours of\nSunday. Conditions were cloudy\nover most of the UK, meaning\namateur astronomers had difficulty seeing the planet. Mars\nwill not swing this close to\nEarth for another 13 years.\nI\n\u2019m not the only one concerned\nabout global warming. As Tony\nBlair warned last year, global\nwarming poses \u201ca challenge\nso far-reaching in its impact\nand irreversible in its destructive\npower, that it alters radically human\nexistence\u201d.\nWhether you think human existence will be altered or not, there is\nnow a consensus that greenhouse\ngas emissions are changing our cli-mate, and with this summer\u2019s hurri-canes, melting ice, floods and more\nhurricanes, there is greater urgency\nin the question, \u2018What can be done?\u2019\nEncouragingly, for many scientists\nthe question is not so much \u2018What\ncan be done?\u2019 but \u2018Why aren\u2019t we\ndoing it?\u2019\nProfessor Keith Barnham of the\nExperimental Solid State Group at\nImperial is a leading advocate of\nsolar energy. He thinks that technologies capable of satisfying our\nenergy needs without polluting the\natmosphere already exist.\nThe sun is a power station of unimaginable scale. \u201cThe radiation which\nfalls on buildings in this country is\nseven times greater than the electricity used within them.\u201d Therefore,\ncovering just a fraction of buildings\nin reasonably efficient solar cells\nwould remove entirely the need for\nconventional energy sources.\nWhile Professor Barnham believes\nthat other alternatives such as wind\nand wave power will all play a role\nin the energy budget, solar energy\npresents several key advantages.\nFirstly, as the sun shines every-where, electricity can be produced in\nample supply at the location where\nit is required, reducing the need\nfor inefficient power lines stretching hundreds of miles. Secondly,\nsolar panels can be incorporated\ninto building design, and so do not\nrequire large scale infrastructure\nof their own. And thirdly, because\nour energy consumption is greatest\nduring the day, solar energy production matches our usage patterns, so\nstorage is less of a problem.\nThus we may well ask: if solar panels are the solution to global warm-ing, why are they not everywhere\nalready? Why are we still talking\nabout nuclear power and natural\ngas? Crucially, the cost of installing solar panels puts them out of\n\u201cWhile we still have\nlight years to travel\nbefore we can ban\nfossil fuels, at least we\nhave a direction.\u201d\nBlue-sky thinking: Tom Tibbits is attempting to create the world\u2019s best\nsingle-junction solar cell. Inset: a single cell, pictured with a 5 pence\npiece. Arrays of these could meet future energy needs.\n\u201cThe radiation falling on\nbuildings in this country\nis seven times greater\nthan the electricity used\nwithin them.\u201d\n\n"

Applications are made\nwith forms only available through\nImperial College Registry, which are\nstamped with the official Imperial\nCollege seal, and the Registrar\u2019s\nsignature.\nOne Imperial student, having had\nhis application rejected, enquired\nabout the reason and was told that\nsignature on record didn\u2019t quite\nmatch up with that provided by the\nRegistry. He was told that nothing\ncould be done until the Registry\nhad sorted out the problem with\nTfL, replacing the signature used\nfor comparison \u2013 meaning he would\nhave to make another application,\ncosting another five pounds, and\nwould have no travel discounts in\nthe mean time. Again, no guarantee\ncould be made that his second application would be successful. Further\ninvestigation revealed that other\nstudents were in similar predica-ments.\nWhat about a refund for students?\nThe official line is that the money\ncovers the processing of the form,\nand is entirely non-refundable \u2013 even\nfor failed applications, regardless of\nreason.\nUnofficially, Registry staff have\nmentioned that it appears that\napproximately half of the applications made recently have been\nrefused on the same grounds, which\nimplies that half have been accept-ed.

Sadly the lumbering chains of\noppression (or student loans if you\nwant to get all \u2018technical\u2019) keep me\nwalking in this green and pleasant\nland. So I\u2019m gonna have to stick with\nthe Audio Bullys, who are so English\nthey make Pete Doherty look like an\nAmerican tourist trying to come to\ngrips with the Underground.\nSo what better why to start off an\nAudio Bully\u2019s concert than to stand\nin the rain? This is not recommended if you are currently trying to\nrecover from Fresher\u2019s Flu, which\nyou caught during a necking session\nwith one of those weird and particularly ugly engineers during a hazy\nevening down the Union. So special\nguest and first on the decks, John\nVick, had a tough job for himself. His\nmix was somewhat minimalist and\nhard-hitting but got people moving\nearly on. His continual use of interruptions of the perpetuum mobile\nwas arousing but a good use of variation on beat and melody made for\nthe right effect.\nNow for the juicy bit. Simon Franks\nquickly forged an electric connection with the audience with a once-over of the summer smash \u2018Shot You\nDown\u2019 and set off into a trip through\ntheir new album \u2018Generation\u2019 with\nan extremely dynamic take on every\ntrack provided by the mysterious\nnew programmer due to the absence\nof Tom Dinsdale.\nSimon\u2019s lyrics punched home the\nmost English aspects of life; getting\nstoned, taking pills and nicking shit,\nduring All Sing Along. Combined\nwith his speaking-not-singing style,\nthis makes for a real contrast. With\nsuch a wide range of voices, surely\nhe could use more than one in a\nsong?\nThe set also provided a few gems\nin the form of The Prodigy\u2019s Out Of\nSpace and a mash up of Generation\nwith Grandmaster Flash\u2019s classic\nWhite Lines. He finally ended the\nset with version of Shot You Down\nthat sounded as if Simon had contracted the largest stutter know to\nmankind.\nTrue to form the Bullys created\nkiller hooks and riffs that kept me\nscaring people on the tube all week.\nHowever, their heavy use of glissando (build ups) became expected\nand by the end was no longer spe-cial. The clever use of silent interruptions built a tower of climax so\ngrand I swear I had an orgasm.\nSick of American gunk? Well, the\nAudio Bullys are back and ready to\nget down, right dirty and British.\nDrop your steak and kidney pie and\nhave a listen or watch, if you\u2019re feeling flush.\nGeorge X\nI found myself last night in a\npacked-out King\u2019s College Union\nwaiting for one of the most hyped\nbands since The Kaiser Chiefs.\nHaving only heard one or two\nMorning Runner songs, like many\nothers I was waiting to be impressed\n- with the rumors circulating about\nthe band and their huge supporting\nroles for Coldplay and Athlete, how\ncould you not be?\nAfter a good warm-up by supporting acts The Holloways and The\nRace, the crowd were ready for a\ngreat show and surged towards the\nstage as Morning Runner came on\nto a round of applause so huge it\nprobably burst a few ear drums.\nThey then spent their opening ten\nminutes whipping the crowd into a\nfrenzy with three songs so pleasing\neveryone was soon dancing along,\nincluding one girl in the front row\nwho seemed to be having some kind\nof fit. The frenzied fast paced music\nfitted perfectly with the almost seizure inducing light show that really\ngot everyone into the gig.\nThe decision to slow things down\nfor a few songs was well received\nas they played their first song ever\nreleased on Faith And Hope, entitled Oceans. The song is slow and\nalmost entirely vocal - a definite\nwinner, with the whole crowd swaying along. Again with a light show\nthat really set the mood, King\u2019s\nseemed to turn into a perfect blue\nocean. They kept the crowd happy\nby retaining the chilled mood with\nthe first song they wrote together, in\na scout hut nonetheless.\nPleasing a crowd is clearly a\nbreeze for Morning Runner as they\nmove into flawless renditions of\ntheir singles, Be All You Want To Be\nand Gone Up In Flames, with huge\ncheers from the entire crowd. These\nbeing practically the only released\nMorning Runner songs around, they\ninduced big sing-alongs and the\nwhole crowd seemed to be chanting\nlyrics back at Matthew Greener.\nMorning Runner clearly have\nlearned a great deal on their supporting tours, pulling off this show\nwith effortless ease. They know\nexactly what to play, keeping the\ncrowd entertained and show that\nthey would be at home playing any\nvenue, large or small. Their upcoming album will certainly be one to\nwatch out for.\nTom Whitson\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHooligan hip hop\nAudio Bullys bring the noize, and Morning Runner prove they can live up to their comparisons\nAudio Bullys\nUniversity of London Union\nHHHHI\nDeath Cab For Cutie - I adore this band, but that new single is utter tripe.\nMorning Runner - the new Coldplay.

Now, I\u2019m\nnot saying that Mendeed inflict that\nkind of pain, but they do their best:\nand, throbbing temples aside, it\u2019s a\ngood thing.\nTaken from their forthcoming\nsecond album, Beneath A Burning\nSky combines high-speed thrash\nguitars and manic drumming with\npiercing death-metal growling and\nthe occasional widdling guitar solo\nthat wouldn\u2019t look out of place on a\nMetallica album. On the evidence of\nthis single, they have stepped away\nfrom the more classical elements\nof their first album into a harder\nstyle less tailored to the cross-over\ncrowd, which will raise their profile no end among the elitist, trOO\nmetal set. Inventive, tight and hun-gry, Mendeed have the potential to\ngo far. Now, where did I put that\nibuprofen?\nAnna Novitzky\nNu-metal is dead. As dead as Dave\nWilliams of Drowning Pool, or Wes\nBorland\u2019s participation in Limp\nBizkit. If only it would stop walking\naround and trying pathetically to\nterrify us, like a zombie puppy, we\ncould all rest easily. Sadly, Disturbed\ndon\u2019t seem to understand this.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard Disturbed\u2019s\nmost famous single, Down With\nThe Sickness. This is that, but less\nenjoyably stompy. It\u2019s even got that\nirritating \u201cwa-a-a-a\u201d thing they do,\nonly they\u2019ve managed to subdue it\nuntil it sounds like a suicidal playboy\u2019s last attempt to convince people he\u2019s enjoying the party. Stricken\nis dull and pointless, recycling the\ntired old conventions of its tired old\ngenre with complete complacency;\nthe shouted, mock-profound lyrics,\nworld-weary dirty guitars and self-righteous bile have all been done\nbefore, and no one wants to listen\nto it. The only really positive thing I\ncan say about this is that I\u2019d rather\nlisten to Stricken than to anything\nby, say, Good Charlotte. Don\u2019t even\nget me started on Good Charlotte.\nAnna Novitzky\nApparently, I\u2019m supposed to have\nheard of Death Cab For Cutie (yes,\nyes you should! - ed.). After five\nalbums, that\u2019s probably not a tall\norder, but I have to confess that I\nhaven\u2019t. So I apologise if I get them\nwrong, or \u2018misunderstand\u2019 them\n\u2013 they strike me as the kind of band\nwhose fans make that kind of accu-sation. Here goes.\nSoul Meets Body is taken from\nDCFC\u2019s first major-label album,\nPlans. It\u2019s a tuneful ballad with a\nsimple melody, cheerful in a gentle\nsort of way and completely unre-markable.\nThe vocalist sounds as if his voice\nhasn\u2019t broken yet, the lyrics sound\nas if they would probably sound very\ndeep if you were half-asleep and it\u2019s\nbland to the point of nausea, but\nit\u2019s faintly catchy in a Simon and\nGarfunkel sort of way. I can tell the\nrefrain will be stuck in my head for\nhours, but I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m\nhappy about that. I really can\u2019t tell\nwhether I like this or not; it\u2019s really\nthat lacklustre.\nI\u2019m sure it will be an enormous\nhit.\nAnna Novitzky\nMendeed\nBeneath A Burning Sky\n(Rising)\nHHHHI\nDeath Cab For Cutie\nSoul Meets Body\n(Atlantic)\nHHIII\nDisturbed\nStricken\n(WEA)\nHIIII\n\n"

What amazes me is that after talking to so\nmany people at Freshers\u2019 Fayre, wearing such a\ngoofy shirt and getting so many signatures that\nnobody had the kind decency to ask me what I\nthought. It is not like I\u2019ve had limited exposure\nwhile writing weekly columns for the Felix or\nrunning for Union Council too. It seems that it\nis not just The Sunday Times that stoops to the\nlowest levels of sensationalist journalism, with\nno regard for consequences for those actually\ntrying to change circumstances for the better.\nThe notion of turning a petition against anti-terror legislation, against curtailing legitimate\npolitical expression (especially against foreign\npolicy) and against the atmosphere of fear\nagainst the Muslim community into a form of\n\u201cterrorist recruiting\u201d is laughable.\nUnfortunately it is all expected in the current\nIslamophobic climate. \u2018Stop Islamophobia\u2019 is\nan independent campaign, founded to increase\nawareness of baseless prejudices against the\nMuslim community and to enhance understanding in British society. I am the campaign\u2019s\nNational Convenor. I don\u2019t actually care if you\ngo to our website, read our material or agree\nwith us, but if anything related to the campaign\nenables you to talk to a Muslim or non-Muslim\nabout today\u2019s climate of fear, then I will have\nsucceeded. All I hope for is candid dialogue. You\ndon\u2019t need to be scared. Muslims don\u2019t bite.\nUnfortunately, any attempt by any Muslim on\nthe face of the earth to voice their legitimate\nconcerns is met with hostility. Prejudices have\nsurfaced yet again, amounting to a smear cam-paign, even though many organisations agree\nwith the points on the petition. Lord Steyn, a\nformer Law Lord, ruled a three month detention\nas unlawful, while Law Lord Lloyd of Berwick\ncalled the offence of glorifying terrorism \u201ca very\nodd provision\u201d. But of course, it doesn\u2019t even\nmatter if there were two million Law Lords\nagainst this Bill, for the government wants to\nsilence any possible criticism at home of their\nformerly \u2018ethical\u2019 foreign policy. The Iraq war\nthough based on the dodgy dossier; though\nopposed by swathes of Iraqis; though a new\nconstitution was ratified under occupation; is a\nmatter of pride for the Government and British\nMilitary heads. Yet it is dubiously unpatriotic of\nme to question the higher order, to even question the nature of the War on Terror or even dare\nto raise pertinent issues such as Palestine.\nMichael Pittoni responded to me last week\non the viability of post Enlightenment joys.\nUnfortunately the theoretical discussion on how\nsociety should be is over. At a near religiously\nsegregated Imperial, it is too idealistic to hope\nfor any sincere discussion, the bigots have made\ntheir minds up. What is happening now is that\nthe values of Voltaire are being swept aside, and\nthe Ancien R\u00e9gime has dominated all discourse.\nKeith Shilson, President of Middlesex University,\nwas suspended for even trying to engage in\nopen and fair discussion with the controversial\nand (even according to the Home Office) nonviolent Islamic political group Hizb ut Tahrir.\nSurprisingly in Britain it has the largest following and attendance at conferences of any Muslim\norganization \u2013 almost by definition making it\nmainstream. How can we debate on banning\nparties when all we know about them is lies?\nSurprisingly the National Executive Committee\nof the NUS is also opposed to the ban on these\n\u201cnear fascist\u201d organisations, citing that dialogue\nis better than state repression. Anything less is\nhysteria, bad journalism and itself bigoted when\none does not even want to talk to those on the\nopposite side due to previous prejudices.\nThe right wing Professor Glees of Brunel\nwould have my kind under constant surveillance.\nHis schoolboy research has gained widespread\nacclaim as incompetence incarnate. In the\nwords of NUS National President Kat Fletcher\nit is, \u201cinflaming a climate of racism, fear and\nhostility\u201d yet it\u2019s backed by no evidence, except\nthat some individuals involved in previous terror\nincidents have been to college. It is tantamount\nto me saying we must nuke Manchester, for\nthere are four murderers there. Even academics\nand professors have their knives out to stab the\nMuslim Community. My dismay ever increases.\nTo Sir Richard Sykes, I know that you will have\npressure surmounting from Education Secretary\nRuth Kelly, and perhaps even higher, to clamp\ndown on those who wish to destroy and murder.\nNo one disagrees with this. I simply ask you\nto help the good, law-abiding and productive\none point six million strong Muslim community of the UK, some of whom are enormously\nhappy here at Imperial, and to not let their lives\nbecome ruined.\n\u2018I\nt could be so different\u2019; wise words there\nfrom the prophets of the Lost. Not the\nLost filmed in Hawaii with the delicious\nMatthew Fox, mind you. I quote their\nlesser relatives from the land of the dead, more\ncommonly known as the Welsh valleys, where\nshops don\u2019t open on Saturdays since their takings\nare too minimal to support the wage bills of the\nHelens that work there.\nIn the pre-internet days I\u2019d have felt for my\nWelsh counterparts. Thankfully Ebay, Net-aporter and Topshop Online do a sterling job and\nHowells\u2019 is open on weekends, so fellow Dior\nAddicts need not feel the pinch. A good job too,\nsince an epidemic of sleazy security guards and\nconstruction workers happened to befall my\npath this week \u2013 meaning that shopping outside\nZone One in our fair city, is a no-go area for me.\nIt\u2019s a crime against the fashion police to do so\nanyway. Did you ever meet a Russian oligarch in\nHammersmith? I rest my case.\nI should really rest my head too, since\nreceiving, \u201cI like your shape\u201d as a chat-up line\nfrom a fifty-year old Snoop Dogg analogy is the\nlast thing you want when you\u2019re just about to buy\nyour Kotex for the month. Looking after sickly\nbabies at Northwick Park had put paid to the\npink sword of my tongue, so a haughty glare was\ngiven, and off I went, running straight into sleaze\nnumber two on the 72 bus. Balding, overweight\nand distinctly prawn-like in shape and size,\nthis South African sweaty made me wretch. He\ngrinned at me in hope before opening with, \u201cDo\nwe know each other?\u201d. I replied in the negative\nand turned to edge away from him. He put a\nhand on my shoulder and came perilously close\nto my ear, before I leaped off at the next stop to\nthe hollered strains of, \u201cFancy a fuck?\u201d.\nThe whole bus turned to look at him, utterly\nflabbergasted that his desperation had not paid\noff. He should take heed of our film columnist\u2019s\nadvice \u2013 matters of the pants are to be dealt with\ndelicacy and tact. At least the geriatric lecturer\nhad the good sense to ask me to play tennis with\nhim first! Sugar daddies are an avenue I\u2019m yet to\nexploit since pure vanity prevents me from doing\nso. What self-respecting third year wants to take\nthe Rector\u2019s assistant\u2019s leftovers? Or that of the\nsecurity guard in the library for that matter? A\ngood friend of mine ended up at the Ivy with her\nnewly-retired GP tutor and his wife. Who knows\nwhere that m\u00e9nage-a-trois will take her, since\nhe declared he\u2019d do, \u201canything for such a sweet\nface\u201d? A fertile imagination knows no bounds,\nand as responsible scientists, we are duty bound\nto develop and exercise our thinking muscles\nevery now and again.\n\u2018F\noreigners should be sent back to\ntheir own countries for their own\ngovernments to deal with them as\nthey fit\u2019 urged Iain Heaton on these\npages last week as he took a break from his\ncharacteristic whinge that he had not been\nable to watch Neighbours since graduating. His\ncolumn started innocently and inanely enough\nbefore taking an inexplicable right turn into a full\non collision with the rights of asylum seekers.\nHeaton highlighted the case of two Albanians\nand a Lithuanian convicted of trafficking\nEastern European girls into Britain and forcing\nthem to work as prostitutes. Expressing more\noutrage that previously two of the men had been\ngranted asylum from persecution than at the\ncrime itself, he went on to outline his solution to\ncrime in Britain: deport all asylum seekers who\nhave committed a crime.\nNever mind that only a tiny fraction of crime is\ncommitted by asylum seekers, a fact that even\nHeaton grudgingly admitted later in his column,\nhis remedy is dangerous and prejudiced.\nThe right to asylum from torture, unjust\nimprisonment and execution is an inalienable\nhuman right common to all people. As with\nevery other nation, we have an international\nresponsibility to welcome asylum seekers, not to\ngreet them with Heaton\u2019s contempt. The choice\nthey had to make was between staying in their\nown country, facing persecution and possibly\neven death, or leaving everything they had to\nseek asylum.\nDisturbingly, Heaton swapped loosely between\nwriting about asylum seekers, immigrants and\nforeigners as if the terms were interchangeable.\nThe reality is that they refer to very different\nthings. There is a huge difference between\nthe political activist seeking asylum from\npersecution and someone seeking to immigrate\nfor economic reasons. Whether Heaton would\ndeport \u2018foreign\u2019 tourists he didn\u2019t make clear.\nWhen Heaton argued that asylum seekers\nshould be sent back to their own governments\nto be dealt with as they see fit he conveniently\nglossed over any consequences. In countries\nfrom which asylum has been granted, being\ndealt with as the \u2018government sees fit\u2019 means\nbeing sent back to torture, persecution,\nunexplained disappearances and death.\nGlibly repeating that old calling card of\nhysterical journalism; that Britain is somehow\n\u2018at bursting point\u2019, unable to accept anymore\nasylum seekers; Heaton demonstrated a\nremarkably loose grip on the facts. In Britain\nwe take fewer asylum seekers per head of\npopulation than our European neighbours; and\nalthough we cannot hope to welcome unlimited\nnumbers, the reality is that we are not being\nswamped or inundated. In truth it is developing\ncountries, close to the world\u2019s flashpoints, which\nhost the greatest share of asylum seekers; 8\nmillion alone in Africa with uncounted numbers\ninternally displaced.\nAsylum seekers do not come to Britain out\nof choice, indeed many desperately want to be\nrepatriated to their country as soon as it is safe\nto do so. South Africans and Chileans who fled to\nBritain during the 1970s left to return home as\nsoon as they were able.\nFor Heaton a bad day might be missing\nNeighbours, but Iain, out there around the world\nthings can be a lot worse than not getting your\ndaily fix of the classic Australian soap.\nAnother day, another life. . .\nThings can be worse than missing Neighbours\nStormy Woods\nAlex guite\nOmar Hashmi\nMuslims don\u2019t bite\n16\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 3 November 2005\nA response to Iain Heaton\u2019s \u201cI should write for the Daily Mail\u201d in Felix 1332\n\n"

    "content": "Coming to university is not only about studying, reading and solving problems. It\u2019s a\nwhole process where students develop skills, find their niches and most importantly gain\nconfidence with their abilities. This is not possible of they don\u2019t feel comfortable with\ntheir surroundings and proud of their roots. Almost a third of our students are overseas or\nfrom an ethnic background. We have given this cohort a considerable thought here at the\nUnion and have realised that the diversity these students bring to the College needs to\nbe celebrated.\nThe Union has finally got its act together and is taking part in London\u2019s most widespread\nstudent campaign, RISE Student Week. Previously titled \u201cRespect\u201d\n, this campaign aims\nto raise awareness of the cultural diversity among students in London universities. With\na predominant anti-racism aspect, this campaign celebrates multiculturalism with the\nsupport of the Mayor of London. This year, with the unfortunate events of July 7th, we\nhave included an Islam awareness gist to it, to extend this celebration to another aspect\nof discrimination.\nRISE Student Week is happening from 7 \u2013 11 November 2005\nDuring that week, we have organised various events from film showings with the AfroCaribbean Society, an Islam awareness talk with the Islamic Society, a RAG fundraiser,\nand a debate about Imperial\u2019s multiculturalism with the Debating Society, and an Imperial\nFootball World Cup happening on Saturday 12 November organised by the Overseas\nSocieties Committee.\nOther events will also follow such as a Model United Nations debate, an International\nFood Fair and a Fashion Show organised by the Overseas Societies Committee.\nOther London universities will also be having interesting events also publicised.\nLook out for posters around campus and a JCR stall to\nget more information, dates and times and do take part\nin these events to commemorate this rising multiculturalism we have a privilege to revel in.\nI\u2019ve started to wonder how far people get into this publication before going, \u2018no, that\u2019s\nenough\u2019. Does anyone get as far as the union section?? In fact, has anyone ever read\nit? If nobody does I wonder quite how controversial I can be. Not that I have anything\nparticularly controversial to say but I\u2019m just a little curious that\u2019s all.\nSomething I do want to talk about is last weeks commemoration day. That truly was\na spectacle. It was my first visit to Albert\u2019s Hall and hopefully not my last. One day I\u2019ll\ngraduate too, honest! The medics graduated alongside the Physical Scientists (or should\nthat be \u2018Natural Scientists\u2019?) and I imagine some of those got a little upset. There appeared to be a rule that people can\u2019t clap unless you win some award, now the new\ndoctors didn\u2019t seem to stick to this rule and every single MBBS graduate got applauded.\nNow there will be those of you that think this is \u2018typical medic arrogance, not sticking to\nthe rules, blah, blah, blah\u2019 but I see it a little differently. These people have been with each\nother for six years, through all the highs and all the lows. They have been there for each\nother when times have been hard, when consultants have bullied, when shifts have gone\non for twenty four hours, when they had to endure PBL, PCC and St Peter\u2019s Hospital and\nwhen it seemed the constant cramming of books into their grey matter would never end.\nWednesday afternoon saw the hugest achievement and test of stamina so rightly recognised by the family they\u2019ve grown up with over the past six years and at times like that it\nmakes you truly proud to be an Imperial Medic.\nWhat\u2019s happening at the ICSMSU?\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB. T: 020 7594 8060 www.union.imperial.ac.uk\nDanny McGuinnes - ICSMSU President\nUnion Building Redevelopment\nSameena Misbahuddin - President\nWell you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the Union Building will be redeveloped with work\nstarting towards the end of this academic year\u2026.\nIn response to the need to refurbish parts of the Union Building, make better use of the\nspace we already have and improve the facilities to a standard students can be proud of,\nthe Union started plans to redevelop the building last year. Flexibility is key in the design,\nas there are so many needs from the building, which we will aim to meet.\nSome of the proposed improvements to the building are refurbishments of the bar and\ncaf\u00e9 areas (dBs and DaVincis), improved lift facilities, games room area, improved facilities for clubs & societies (e.g. storage, changing rooms, student activity centre) and the\nintroduction of a coffee bar/social area.\nThe process started early last year, with a firm of architects being chosen and the surveys and focus groups that were held last term. The architects gave preliminary ideas\nwhich were then published in Felix and on the Union website and students were asked to\ngive their feedback to the proposals.\nAt the end of the summer term the architects proposed 3 options, which varied in cost,\nand over the summer business plans were written to gain the support of College for this\nproject and pleasingly, College are supporting us in this project. It is a key improvement\nthat needs to be made to the campus facilities and we are working with them in this\nproject.\nCurrently the next stage of design is underway. This goes into further details of what has\nalready been proposed at Union Council (as mentioned above). Users of specific areas\nare being contacted for this stage, at the end of which there will be more information and\ndesigns for all students to give feedback on, which can then be incorporated into the final\ndesign stage.\nAt the moment usage of the ground and first floors are being discussed in greater detail\nto get a combination of facilities in these areas which will give maximum benefit to\nstudents. Some ideas being considered are whether the coffee bar area proposed for\nthe first floor should also sell some alcohol or whether it should remain an alcohol free\nsocial area. Other ideas are whether the public should be allowed into these areas as\nwell or perhaps only during the holidays..? When considering these, both the service for\nthe students as well as the need to generate income to subsidise the rest of the Union\u2019s\nactivities are being considered and we invite any feedback you have.\nIf you have any feedback, want to get involved or have any questions, email:\nyoursay@ic.ac.uk. We are also intending to give a presentation of the Building plans\nand designs in the Union Foyer, so watch out for more information about this\u2026In the\nmean time, check www.union.ic.ac.uk.\nFaculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences Merger\nTuesday morning I hear that the Faculties of Life Sciences and Physical Sciences are\nmerging to form a Faculty of Natural Sciences. Whilst I can see some reasons for College doing this, the issue is that they did not inform the students before the decision was\nmade. They didn\u2019t inform the Union who, had we known about it, would\u2019ve informed\nstudents and the reps affected and raised any concerns expressed.\nOver the coming days myself and the officers for the Physical Sciences\u2019 and Life Sciences\u2019 Union will be working to find out how this has happened and moreover what affect\nthis may have on students and ensure that the affect is not negative. There is already\ntalk about work to help relationships between the 2 Faculties so that when the Faculty is\nfully merged next year, students feel united in the Faculty.\nA Week to Rise...\nSarah Khatib - Deputy President (Education & Welfare\nThink the Union Building needs a facelift?\nThink that the building has potential that it just isn\u2019t meeting?\n\n"

My personal favourite was\nAlessandro Bee\u2019s Dusk Flight.\nThe abstract motion of the bird is\nmesmerising, and his clever use of\nspeeds enables him to describe the\nessence of the form and the flight\nwhilst avoiding the irrelevant details\nthat would only detract from the\neffect.\nAnother eye-catching piece is\nThomas Endlein\u2019s Rainforest Dawn.\nA beautifully shot serene piece; it is\nmemorable for the heart-breaking\ncaption which accompanies: \u201cAs the\nsun rose, the air became filled with\nthe song of birds and gibbons, but\nthe very first noise I heard was a\ndistinct chainsaw.\u201d\nThe overall winner, Manuel\nPresti\u2019s Sky Chase, is a powerful\nand beautiful work.
