Won 4-3.\nThursday Royal Belfast Golf Club. Lost 5-2.\nFriday Crawfordsburn Country Club. Won 5-2.\nSaturday Queens University, Belfast. Lost 4-2.\nWhen our last two courts\nwent up in flames, is was clear\nthat only one course remained\nopen to , the Squash Club:\nemigration. Consequently, a team\nof seven was mustered to' tour\nIreland during the last week in\nMarch. The com pet ant part* of\nthe team consisted of\none Internationally-famous\nEgyptian insect-hunter\none ether Squash player and\nthe Captain of Tennis.\nEndeavouring to support them\nwas a mixed rabble :\u2014\none Irishman (to speak to the\nnatives)\none born Guinness-drinker\nane Army Deserter and\none former Naval man, whom\neveryone hoped would be sea-sick.\nIn order to keep natural\nenemies apart, the team was\nshipped out in separate boats.\n(2 to Belfast, 2 to Dublin and 3\nto Dun Laoughie). By some\nmira e'e, all managed to rendezvous at the girls' hostel in\nDublin where ac como dati on had\nbeen arranged.\nDuring the course of the next\n6 days, we drove 700 miles and\nplayed 6 Squash matches :\u2014\nThe insect-hunter won all his\nmatches (naturally), and the\nother Squash player won 3 out\nof 6. The remainder won either\n2 matches or one. Hospitality\nafter the matches, was in accordance with the best Irish tr adit ions, and led to many interesting\nepisodes.\nBefore leaving Cork, we all\nwent to kiss the Blarney Stone,\nduring which operation one\nturban fell off into the bushes\nfar below. Our programme left\nlittle time to spare, but the golfers in the party managed to fit\nin 3 rounds of golf, much to the\ndelight of the sailor who thus\navenged successive squash defeats at the hands of the \"other\nSquash player\".\nMembers of the team were:\nSherif Afifi\nMichael Combes\nJohn Richardson\nPeter Schofield\nAdrian Erskine\nPeter Riding\nUppi Anand\nIdentification of the characters\nin the story is left as an exercise\nto the reader.\np,p. s. Bottle Returns\nR.S. M.11 pts. C. S.M.0 pts.\nThis year it was the turn of the\nCamborne School of Mines to\ncome up to London to contest the\n\" Bottle.\" The Bottle, a Trophy\ncompeted for annually between\nthe R.S. M. and the C. S.M., was\nlast held by Mines in 1958 and\nafter a narrow defeat by 3 pts. to\nall last year the Mines were raring to go.\nA goodly crowd of 100 or so\nsaw Camborne kick off with the\nadvantage of a blustery wind and\nthe sun at their backs. The\nplay was lively from the start with\nMines using their backs very early\non in the game, but it was evident\nthat the Camborne backs were\nstrong in defence. After about a quarter of an hour's play Mines\nwent into the lead through a penalty-try awarded as the result\nof some obstruction by the Camborne full-back when caught behind his own line by Jeff Thompson; Cast converted. The Mines\npack was more than holding its\nown in the set pieces and territorial ly seemed to have the game well\nin hand. The second half saw\nCamborne playing against the\nwind and their tactics in dealing\nwith this situation was to prove to\nbe their eventual downfall. Rather\nthan kick their way out of trouble\nthey preferred to run with the\nball and as a result they never\nleft their own half for the rest of\nthe game. The Mines back-row\nof Thompson, Turner and Coxall\ncontinually flurried the Camborne\nbacks into mistakes and the whole\npack played with great fire and\nenthusiasm, particularly in the\nloose.\nMidway through the second half,\na quick heel from a set-scrum just\ninside the \" 25 \" gave Wakelin\nenough room for a break and\nwith the full-back Gardner coming\ninto the line to make the overlap\nForbes-Jones had an easy run in\nfor a try which was not con-verte d. Shortly afterwards, from\na set-scrum on the Camborne 5-yard line the scrum-half, Marshall, made a blind side break and\npassed to Forbes-Jones who\nscored in the corner to make it\n11\u20140.\n3\nSo the Bottle returns to the\nMines and on this showing it\nlooks as if it is here to stay.\nSPORTS DAY\nIt was the wettest Sports Day ever. Most of the Motspur Park track\nwas covered in half an inch of water, and the conditions caused many of\nthe events to be cancelled. The hurdling events, tug of war, staff race,\nPresidents' net ball match, and the programmed National Anthem did not\ntake place. This year the bad weather was particularly disappointing as\na match between IC and Gottingen University was held in conjunction\nwith the intercollegiate competition. The result of the \" International\"\nwas never in doubt, Gottingen winning by 86 points to 56. It must be\nremembered, in all fairness to IC\nthat Gottingen is a large University of some ten thousand students,\nmany of whom specialise in physical education: the slaughter of IC\nwas perhaps excusable.\nThe RCS victory over Guilds\nwas in doubt up to the last event,\nthe high jump, which was eventually won, ironically enough, by\nNicholson, the Mines captain. The\nfinal result \u2014 RCS 124 points,\nC&G118, RSM 57.\nThe first event, the 100 yards,\nstarted almost half an hour late,\nthe handful of brave supporters\nshivering in the stand. Harrison\n(RCS) managed to come second\nbetween the two Germans, his time\nof 10.5 sees, was but a yard slower\nthan the winner, but this was no\nday for records. Woods the IC\ncaptain, achieved the best IC per-form ance, winning the 440 in 50.2\nseconds, one of ICS three victories\nover Gottingen. Clifton (RCS),\nwon an exciting 880 yards by a couple of yards in the comparatively poor time of 2 min. 1.6 sees.,\nand Wilkins, the RCS captain, led\nnearly all the way, to win the mile\nin 4 min. 27.6 sees. The 1500\nmetres steeplechase was an all IC\naffair, and was won by the Guilds\ncaptain, Colvin, in 4 min. 42.6\nsees. The field was unfortunately\nweakened by the withdrawal of\nMike Harris RCS, who slipped\nand hurt his leg while practising\non the wet grass.\nThe first IC men in the other\nevents were:\n220 yards, Wood, RCS, 23.2 sees.\nLong jump, Wade, RCS,\n21 ft. 6 ins.\nTriple jump.\nPole vault, Asekun, Mines,\n9 ft. 6 ins.\nJavelin, Martin, Guilds.\nDiscus, Williams, Guilds,\n105 ft. 6 ins.\nShot, White, Guilds, 36 ft.\nGOLF\nThat little college off High\nStreet Ken. who knocked IC out of\nthe UL Rugby and Hockey Cups\nhas been at it again.

Because of bad weather, our\naccommodation will not be ready\ntill the end of August, and since\nthis period falls during the College\nSummer vac, I was wondering\nwhether any students would be\nwilling to rent us their furnished\naccommodation while away on expeditions or holidays.

NICE.\n' QUOTE OF THE WEEK\nJust you stay here while I go\nand collect some of the others.\n(Lone policeman to Festival Hall\nCommando).\nl.C. CHOIR\nThe performance of Verdi's Requiem by the I.C. Choir at the\nend of last term was a pleasant\nsurprise for one who has had\nlittle to do with this society. It is\nreputed that the I.C. students attempt to broaden their outlook\nouside the realms of science and\none tangible proof of this lies in\na creditable college choir.\nFew amateur choirs in the\ncountry would choose to perform\nsuch a difficult work in one of the\nleading music colleges knowing\nthat during the Easter period at\nleast one professional choir was\nattempting this work. The\nsoloists, all from the National\nOpera School rose to the occasion\nand the charming Ruth Little\ngave a warm interpretation of the\nmezzo-soprano part. David\nRead, the bass, was reminiscent\nof Christoff as Phillipe in Don\nCarlos, maintaining his tone\nthroughout the range of his part.\nGabriel Trujillo clearly appealed\nto the ladies around me and his\nrather thin tenor voice carried\nthrough the full choir and orchestra surprising well.\nFull credit must be given to the\nconductor, Eric Brown, who devoted most of his energies during\nthe performance to the orchestra,\nfor training the choir to such a high degree of accuracy and re-liability. The choir tended to be\ndominated by the female voices\nparticularly during the Dies Irae\nand Sanctus. The basses lacked\nthe sonority essential to the harmony of the Lux Aeterna but\nthey did succeed with the fine\nLacrymosa which ended the first\nhalf. The tenors fared well but\nwere short of numbers.\nThe performance was not technically perfect but the overall\neffect was very pleasing. It was\nobvious that members of I.C. Choir enjoy their singing and the\naudience was not slow to appreciate this.\nEDUCATION EDUCATION\nEDUCATION\nJust out in your racks last week\nis a questionnaire devised by a group here at I.C. investigating\nthe advice system in schools.\nWith the help of Tyrrel Burgess\nof \" New Society \" and of advice\nfrom a research student at the\nL.S.E., the questionnaire is going\nout to a1 in 3 sample of all\nFreshmen at I.C.,U. C. and\nL.S.E.

The team visited the\nLouvre, Notre Dame, Musee d 'Art\nModerne, and an evening at\nL 'Opera to see Don Carlos was\norganised. To finish off one evening in Montmartre everyone ended\nup at Les Halles for onion soup in\nthe true Parisian style. However,\na fragrant odour soon diverted\nmany nostrils and it was fish and\nchips 14 times.\nOne day we played football.\nHowever the game (against L 'Ecole\nCentrale) was not as enjoyable as\nhad been hoped. The main difficulty was language and as the\nreferee was Russian \"O\" Level\nFrench didn't help. The result of\na rather scrappy game was a2 \u20142\ndraw.\nAfter the game the destination\nwas \"Le Jockey\" to which fourteen\nwere admitted at a reduced party\nrate. The cabaret was a little corny\nto say the least. Finally, at 2.0 a.m. with Rayner still holding the record (no drinks from his ml. of\nChampagne) a young lady dressed\nas a Bunny Rabbit came on, took\nher clothes off and walked out\nout followed by most of the four-teen. . A few die-hard s, however,\nstayed till 3.30 a.m., during which\ntime the Captain had gone to sleep,\nand Price had unsuccessfully tried\nto fool a crummy mind-reader.\nOn Saturday night Fletcher and\nthe shifty-eyed Pick came in ran-di ly raving about \" Le Sexy \" only\nto find Wilshaw not quite himself.\nEight of the lads were walking him\naround with their hands on his\nhead, as he thought it was coming\noff.

Cox, unfortunately was short of one of his\nsketches due to the notoriously ill-equipped Parisian toilette s.

Hockey Club attended the\nTwenty-ninth Annual Hockey\nFestival at Lowestoft over the\nEaster week-end. The players\nwere: John Skinner (Capiain),\nFrank Allen, Mike Butler,\n\"Ned\" Castell, Tom Creer,\nTony Evans, \" Rick \" Heading,\nChris. Hennessy, \" Ossie \" Hunter, Chris. Packard, Derek\nPainter, Kerry Peters, Colin\nSmith, Mike Stenning and Nick\nWalker.\nThe Festival as always was very\nenjoyable, the matches were\nplayed on good grounds with skill\nand determination, and in a good\nfestival spirit. The first match of\nthe five played was against Manchester University Lions who\nwere defeated 4\u20141, \"Ossie\"\nHunter in his usual form scoring\ntwo, and John Skinner and Tony\nEvans getting one each. However this initial success was tempered by losing 3\u20140 to Kettering\nin the afternoon, the forwards\nsquandering chances left, right\nand over the top. On Saturday,\nanother two matches were played.\nIn the morning the I.C. forwards\nrecovered their form and the\nGreenshanks were defeated 3\u20141,\nChris. Hennessy scoring one\ngoal and \" Ossie \" remaining consistent scoring two. The afternoon produced the first drawn\nmatch. Our opponents were the\nRoyal Agricultural College,\nCirencester who started playing\nwith the determination to win at\nall costs. Their sportsmanship\nand knowledge of he rules were\noften in doubt and the game\nquickly degenerated. The final\nresult was a two all draw, Nick\nWalker and Kerry Peters scoring\nfor I.C. In the evening the bad\ntaste of the match was quickly\nreplaced by the more pleasant\none of the local brews. No\nmatches played on Sunday and\nand this was all to the good as a few individuals required peace\nand quiet in which to recover\nfrom the evening before. The day\nwas spent in a variety of ways.\nSeveral players enjoyed competitive rounds on the nearby putting\ngreen and a short walk to the Pier\nBar to see if the beer there still\ntasted the same. Others preferred to practise Hockey on the\nfront. Initially they played on the\nlawns but were soon informed\nthat there were some \" Keep of\nthe grass\" notices which had\nbeen officially removed to prevent\nthem becoming souvenirs. The\npromenade then became the practice pitch but their efforts were\nfrustrated again, the ball frequently going in the sea, so they\nalso retired to the Pier Bar.\nThe visit to the Festival was\nbrought to a conclusion with an\nenjoyable match against Kijana\non Monday. The match was\nstrongly contested and ended in\na one all draw, Chris. Hennessy\nscoring for I.C.

    "content": "6 FELIX FELIX PROFILES FRANK IRVING\nBeit's Warden\nAmong the number of brilliant young men who arrived at\nImperial College just after World War II, there came to the department of Aeronautics one F.G. Irving, Esq. A graduate of Liverpool University (whose finery he dons for Commemoration Days),\nFrank's transfer of allegiance from the Mersey to the Thames has\nproved a considerable enrichment to the College scene. His activities\nas an academic worthy are not of wide general interest, though\nthe supersonic wind tunnel with its attendant storage cylinders and\ngiant vent pipe is evidence of his technical expertise ; but he has\na remarkable range of other interests and achievements.\nHe is perhaps best known in his\nrole of Warden of Beit Hall. The\nIrving stature is not overpower-ingly massive, but for years, the\nappearance of his ac qui line pro-file, blue eyes glinting ironically\nbehind their glasses, the preliminary \" Hmmmm \" and the subsequent verbal a string enc ies, have\nquelled the most turbulent of res i dents. His encounters with amateur steeple jacks, nocturnal bell\nringers, Christmas tree removers,\nphantom instrumentalists and\nmiscellaneous convivial s have\nmade him immune to astonish-ment, without diminishing his\nsense of humour. Heads have\nsome t mies been lopped after particularly outrageous incidents, but\nFrank's rule is notably un despotic. Year by year, the Beit\nHall photo shows him surrounded\nby residents, some even smiling\nand very few in attitudes of terror\nor supplication. His calm and\nefficient administration has set a difficult standard for the coming\nmultiplicity of wardens.\nFrank is also a leading figure\nin the gliding world and has contributed greatly to the present high\nstanding of the IC gliding club\nand to the development of the\ngliding centre at Lasham in\nHampshire. A highly accomplished pilot, holding the gold\n\" C\" with diamond, and coauthor of a book on unpowered\nlevitation, he still holds, with\nLome Welch, the British two-seater distance record. This flight\nfrom Lasham to Belgium also\nproved that his persuasiveness,\narmed with only a driving licence,\nis at least equivalent to a full set\nof international documents plus\ncurrent passport. He is the chairman of the technical committee of\nthe British Gliding Association,\nand he has been a member of the\nBritish team at several world\nchampionships. Functioning usually as retrieving crew, he is\nadept at this hazardous form of\nmotor sport in which an enormously long trailer is towed\nfuriously over any type of road\nwhich happens to lead in the\ngeneral direction in which the\nglider was last seen. Any time\nnot spent in retrieving, d is mant ling, reassembling and renovating\nthe machine is customarily devoted to fostering international\ngoodwill. This admirable cause\nhas taken Frank all over Europe,\nand in February '63 to the Argentine pampas. The European\nChampionships at St. Yan aided\nhim particularly in his study of\nburg undies, and he has acquired\nsome interesting bizarre recordings of Eastern European music\nfrom an excursion in the vicinity\nof the Iron Curtain.\nSomewhat regrettably, one\nmust record that Irving is grossly\ndeficient in his appreciation of ball\ngames, except for a moderate\ncompetence at squash.\nHe is also an indifferent performer at the air-water boundary,\nbut weighed down with a lead\nbelt and equipped with flippers,\netc., he manoeuvres as skilfully\nas if he was airborne. Frank accompanied the very successful Underwater Club expedition\nto Malta, and an amphora of\nabout 200 B.C., one of many re-covered, adorned his flat before\nbeing pr seen ted to the College.\nHis lofty eyrie e at the top of Beit\nHall also contains a large collection of gliding mementos, an imposing stereo player, and a multitude of colour transparencies illustrating his quaint extra-mural activities.\nAlthough his domain includes\nthe College's residential accommodation for ladies, Frank seems\ndetermined to remain the only\nunmarried warden. It is not a little surprising that this expert\ndancer, former Union cabaret\nstar, and in private life, benevolent uncle, should have contrived\nto retain his eligibility. His recent purchase of an electric\nblanket for overnight stays at\nLasham is said to have caused\neven the single ladies of the gliding community to lose hope.\nThere is no space to enlarge\nfurther on the Irving characteristics (the taste for Elizabethan\nsong, the highly idiosyncratic\nvocabulary \u2014 the Metropolitan\npolice are always \" the gen-d arm erie,\" the consuming interest\nin \" Which\" craft). His purposeful commuting across Prince Consort Road\u2014longer journeys require a car\u2014is part of the College\nscene : he has contributed much\nto our corporate life, and we trust\nthat he will do so for much longer\nyet.\nK.E. WE ALE. MINUTES OF A MEETING..\nPresident: Gentlemen, you\nhave all been circulated with\nmini-recordings of the last meet-ing. I regret to say that as the\nrecording machine has broken\ndown you will in future have to\ndo without any records of the\nprevious meeting. The grave\nfinancial state of the Union renders the cost of a new recorder\nprohibitive.\nTreasurer : A sensible decision.\nCarruthers : Hear, hear!\nAsst. Secretary: I entirely\nagree.\nStandley : Now wait a minute!\n(All eyes fix on the speaker.\nSecretary smoulders ; Treasurer\ngrits his teeth ; President takes\nout a packet of government issue\ncancer-free cigarettes and calmly\nlights one. Standley ignores\nthem.) At the last meeting we\nsanctioned the Bowling Club's application for an atomic powered paint sprayer for their\nbowling balls. Well, I mean to\nsay, that cost 750 nobles, didn't it ? I really don't see why we\nshouldn't spend a mere 40 on a new recorder. I think it would\nbe just as useful.\nChairman of Athletics : (apop-let ic after last remark) Mr. Standley, you have an extraordinary\nsense of values, if I may say so.\nIn fact, I very much doubt\nwhether you have any sense of\nvalues at all. Are you seriously\nadvocating that we spend 40\nnobles on a recorder ? Why, we\ncould buy four bowling balls for\nthat price, or two electro-mag-ne tic golf clubs, or (practically\nexploding at the thought) at least\nsix weeks supply of radioactive\nmuscle liniment for the rugby\nclub ! Do you realise . . .\nPresident: (interrupting) Yes,\nwell we all agree with that. (To\nStandley) We are all aware of\nyour radical views, Mr. Standley, but now is not the time to\nstate them, I feel. We have\nsome serious business on the\nagenda, and I think we must get\non with it.\nStandley: Now look here,\nthat's a little unfair ! I...( drowned by cries of \" Oh, shut\nup !\" \" Do shut up !\" \" For \u2014's sake, can't you keep quiet!\" etc.\nPresident: I would remind you,\ngentlemen, that we are constitutionally bound to break for exercise every 30 minutes, and we\nhave already wasted 10 arguing\nabout trifles. I suggest we move\nimmediately to item 2 on the\nagenda : correspondence. Is there\nany correspondence ?\nSecretary: We have a letter\nfrom the London School of\nEconomics challenging us to a debate.\nCvruthers: What's a\" debate \"\nPresident: You, have a bad\nmemory, Mr. Carruthers. You\nwere present when this Council\ndisbanded the Debating Society\ntwo years ago.\nCarruthers: Oh yes, that's right!\n\n"

Should anyone feel that they\nwould like to help, especially next Saturday, they will be more than\nwelcome. If anyone feels that they cannot give of time then any\ndonation will be gratefully received.\nThe money that we raise will be financing the building of small\nearth dams in the Northern provinces of Nyasaland thus bringing\nlife to millions of acres of hitherto arid land. Thus it may be\nseen that our money will not be simply going into the vast maw\nof Asia but will be doing real good. The aims of the Freedom\nfrom Hunger Campaign are best portrayed by the adage : Give a starving man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach him to cast\na net and you feed him and his family for ever.\nI hope that everyone will enjoy themselves.\nYours sincerely,\nJOHN R.

All in all, it was quite\nan ordeal, and it might perhaps\nbe an idea if the form of the\ncompetition was changed so as to\nmake it less formidable for the\ngirls taking part.
