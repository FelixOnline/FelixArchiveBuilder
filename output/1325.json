The Department of\nAgricultural Sciences \u2013 which is wholly\nbased at Wye \u2013 will be closed and the\nfuture of the campus is under threat.\nStudents\u2019 groups at Wye have since\nexpressed frustration at a perceived lack\nof communication from College manage-ment. They have also questioned the reasons why the College has chosen this\nparticular course of action.\nSince his appointment last year,\nProfessor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, the\nDeputy Rector, has spent much of his\ntime dealing with this difficult situation.\nWith this in mind, I took the opportunity\nto try to find some of the answers Wye\nstudents have been looking for.\nThe Deputy Rector explains that such\nsweeping changes are necessary for\nthree main reasons: low student numbers on most courses at Wye, declining\nresearch standards and \u2013 unsurprisingly\n\u2013 huge debts.\nHe tells me: \u201cOne of the first things I\nhad to do was to ask the question, why\nis this Faculty [of Life Sciences, of which\nhe is Acting Principal] in considerable\ndebt? We looked carefully at what was\ngoing on, and found that about 40% of that\ndeficit was down to the Department of\nAgricultural Sciences, which was totally\nbased at the Wye campus. So it was\ndecided to close that department.\n\u201cVery quickly we began to look at certain courses that were being held at Wye,\nwhich were attracting such low numbers\nof students that sometimes we ended up\nhaving more teachers than students, and\nthat is completely untenable. With the\nsupport of Senate [the College\u2019s senior\nacademic body], it was decided to close\nthose courses.\n\u201cThe third reason was the academic\nachievement. If you look at the results of\nthe last Research Assessment Exercise,\nthey questioned whether Wye was achieving the levels of excellence that Imperial\nsets itself.\u201d\nSir Leszek insists that the College is\ngood at communicating and consulting\nwith its students, despite the fact that\ncertain groups at Wye would strongly\ndisagree. \u201cA lot of the consultation that\ntakes place is more informal than formal,\nand I think that is a strength,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI offer monthly meetings to the Faculty\nPresident and the student president at\nWye, so they have every opportunity to\nbring up any anxiety. So yes, I believe\nwe are good at communicating with the\nstudent body.\u201d\nAn official College press release, dated\nlast August, suggests otherwise. It reads:\n\u201cThere will be no impact on course provision for current or prospective (2005\nentry) students on taught undergraduate\nor postgraduate courses.\u201d But Sir Leszek\ntells me not only that prospective students in agricultural sciences were told\nto look elsewhere, but also that he cannot\nguarantee that current students will complete their courses at Wye.\n\u201cWe made it absolutely clear that we\nwere closing those courses down,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cThe decisions were taken early\nso that those who were applying had the\nopportunity to apply to other institutions\nthat were offering those courses.\n\u201cWe will continue to support [current]\nstudents on whichever course they have\nundertaken at Imperial. They will complete that course at Imperial, we have\nmade that commitment absolutely clear.\u201d\nBut will that be at the Wye campus or\nelsewhere? \u201cI can\u2019t make that absolute\nguarantee.\u201d\nSir Leszek says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know\u201d\nwhether sections of the Wye campus\nwill be sold off, but hopes to reassure\nstudents that \u201cthis is not Armageddon\ntomorrow. We\u2019re talking about a medium\nterm plan. This is a three to five year\nthink about how we\u2019re going to manage\nthis process.\u201d\nHe believes that \u201cthere are some very\ngood science-related groups that work\nat Wye,\u201d some of which are \u201cworking\nbelow the high levels of excellence that\nwe believe they\u2019re capable of, and so will\nhave to relocate from the Wye campus.\u201d\nHe tells me that Wye College could still\nbe a centre for academic excellence, but\nin an entirely different form. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nhappening is you\u2019re locked into the concept that Wye has to be a land-based,\nbiology-based campus,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy?\nIt may actually have an opportunity to be\nsomething very different.\n\u201cWhat I do believe, having looked at it\nvery carefully, is that where there is academic opportunity in Wye, it will almost\ncertainly not reside in the Life Sciences\narea, because the critical mass does not\nsupport the kind of science that I believe\nImperial should be undertaking on that\ncampus.\u201d\nThe best in the UK?\nAs one would expect, the Deputy Rector\nalso has a range of other issues to\ndeal with. He joined Imperial from the\nUniversity of Wales in 2001, the year in\nwhich he was knighted in recognition of\nhis research into vaccines.\nHe has high praise for his place of\nwork. \u201cI think this is the most fantastic educational institution in the United\nKingdom,\u201d he says confidently. \u201cI think\nit\u2019s way ahead of anywhere else. It\u2019s a\nplace that has its own identity and pur-pose, and it looks after its staff and students extremely well. Excellence is the\nmain driver, be that in education, in training or in research, that\u2019s what it strives\nfor, so there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be.\u201d\nStrong words indeed, but surely the\nmost fantastic educational institution in\nthe UK would be number one in all the\nleague tables... wouldn\u2019t it?\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t the dreaming spires of\nOxford and Cambridge,\u201d says Sir Leszek.\n\u201cWe are a very different institution. There\nare certain things that are always going\nto be far more difficult for us to score on,\nbut if you look at things like engineering\nwe\u2019re at the very top.\u201d\nStudent activities\nThe Deputy Rector was heavily involved in\nstudent activities in his younger days, as\n\u2018President of the Non-Sporting Societies\u2019\nat the Welsh National School of Medicine\nin Cardiff. He believes that our students\u2019\nunion is \u201cvery independently minded\u201d\nand \u201cvery effective\u201d.\n\u201cWhen it wants to be heard, it makes\nits views known,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething\nthat has always impressed me is that you\ncan always have a proper discussion and\ndebate with students here, who I believe\nshare the vision that we have for Imperial\n\u2013 they want this to be a high quality institution that reflects their own abilities in\nbeing here.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, given his own involvement as a student, he believes that clubs\nand societies are \u201cvery important.\u201d So\nwhy is he asking the Union to justify it\u2019s\nclub and society activity in the latest\nfinancial planning round?\n\u201cBecause I ask everyone to justify financially all the activities they undertake.\nWe have to decide how far we\u2019re able to\nsponsor a particular activity for a small\nnumber of students, given the budget that\nwe have.\u201d\nWhen I ask him whether club budgets\nare going to be cut, he quickly brings\nup the new sports centre, where \u201cwe\u2019re\nlooking at making certain activities free\nof charge.\u201d It appears, then, that Union\nclubs may have their budgets cut in order\nto make certain activities free of charge\nat the sports centre.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually freeing individual students from having to pay membership\nfees for certain activities, which will\nincrease the amount of resource that students have available to them. Clubs will\nhave to say, well, if students wish to participate in certain group activities then\nmaybe they will have to contribute rather\nmore to those clubs and societies.\u201d\nAnd will he be the next Rector? \u201cI\u2019ve\nno idea,\u201d replies Sir Leszek, who has\nbeen touted as the obvious successor to\nSir Richard Sykes. \u201cBut what I can say is\nthat the next Rector of Imperial College\nwill have one of the most important jobs\nin British higher education.\u201d\nTHE FELIX INTERVIEW felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cI think this is the most fantastic educational institution in the United Kingdom\u201d \u2013 Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz (left), Deputy Rector of Imperial College, with Dave Edwards\n\u201cCertain courses at Wye\nwere attracting such low\nnumbers that sometimes\nwe ended up having more\nteachers than students\u201d\nPHOTO: SIMON CLARK\n\u201cThe RAE questioned\nwhether Wye was\nachieving the levels of\nexcellence that Imperial\nsets itself\u201d\n\u201cCurrent students will\ncomplete their course at\nImperial, but will that be\nat Wye? I can\u2019t make that\nabsolute guarantee\u201d\n\n"

The ban remains\nin place from 9am to 9pm\nMonday to Friday for the rest\nof the summer term.\nDespite opposition from\nsome students and staff, a\ncomplete ban on smoking was\nintroduced in the bar on a trial\nbasis beginning on 1 March.\nCustomers were encouraged\nto submit their feedback via\nthe \u2018Yoursay\u2019 forms. The\nresponse was mixed \u2013 more\npositive comments were\nreceived than negative ones,\nbut support for the ban was\nnot high enough to convince\nthe Union to introduce it on a\nfull-time basis.\nSameena Misbahuddin, the\nUnion\u2019s Deputy President\n(Finance and Services),\ntold Felix: \u201cThere\u2019s no perfect solution so we\u2019ve tried\nto strike a balance.

The\nban meant that running costs\nincreased at weekends, as\nextra staff were needed to\nopen the adjacent Union bar\nwhere smoking was allowed.\nStudents are encouraged\nto give their views on the\nnew arrangement using the\n\u2018Yoursay\u2019 forms.\nSmoking ban lifted on\nevenings and weekends\nHaving been banned for the last three months, smoking is once again allowed in Da Vinci\u2019s Bar, but only at weekends or after 9pm on weekdays\nPaddington\n\u2018super\nhospital\u2019\nplans\nscrapped\nBy Rupert Neate\nPlans for a flagship \u2018superhospital\u2019 which would have\nreplaced many of Imperial\u2019s\nteaching hospitals have been\nscrapped as a result of government procrastination and\nincreasing costs.\nThe Paddington Basin\nProject had been beset with\nproblems since its inception\nin 1997, the latest being a\ndrastic hike in land costs from\n\u00a399 to \u00a3130m. This brings the\ntotal cost of the project to\nnearly \u00a31bn, a burden too\nhigh for the beleaguered\nNHS to swallow. Scrapping\nthe project now wastes \u00a310m\nalready spent on consultant\nfees.\nThe planned \u2018health campus\u2019 would have seen services\ntransferred from the nearby\nHarefield, Royal Brompton\nand St Mary\u2019s hospitals to the\nsite adjacent to Paddington\nrailway station. The project\nhad the full backing of Tony\nBlair, who once called it\n\u201cimaginative and extraordinary\u201d.\nCampaigners who were\nkeen to see the world-renowned Harefield Heart\nand Lung Hospital remain\nwelcomed the news.

You\u2019re not designed to\njust sit there. You\u2019re a hunter-gatherer, dammit.\u201d\n\u2013 Outdoor clothing\ncompany slogan\nCycling to college at 4.30am\non a Sunday is bad enough,\nbut when you are on your way\nto an adventure race having\nnever done anything of the\nsort before, you seriously ask\nyourself what on earth you\nare doing.\nA few months ago I was\nintroduced to adventure rac-ing.Teamsorsolocompetitors\norienteer around the countryside in a multi-sport event\nbased around trail running\nand mountain biking, which\nlasts in the order of hours to\ndays. Being familiar with running and cycling (but not talented in either), I wanted to\ngive it a go, and last week four\nof us from Imperial entered a\n\u2018Dynamic Adventure Race\u2019 in\nthe Quantocks in Somerset. I\nmean, how hard can a bit of\norienteering be?\nAdventure racing has been\ndescribed as \u201cthe UK\u2019s fastest\ngrowing sport\u201d (admittedly on\nadventure racing websites),\nbut before the event I had\nlittle idea of what to expect.\nWe competed in a \u2018standard\u2019\nevent aimed at newcomers,\nwhich had time limits of two\nhours for running and three\nhours for cycling with a one\nhour transition period (ie\neat Jaffa Cakes and rest as\nmuch as you can) in between.\nThe aim was to visit as many\ncheckpoints as possible from\na multitude scattered in the\nannoyingly hilly surrounding\narea, although there were\ncomplications such as different score values which were\nonly revealed after the start\nof the race.\nTo give more of an idea of\nwhat it\u2019s like, here\u2019s how it\nstarted. Arnaud and myself\nbegan by going straight up\na brutal gradient, which\nreduced us to more of an\nembarrassing shuffle than a\nrun. Halfway up, I had the fun\nand games of trying to find a\n30cm long hidden stick based\non a grid reference. After ten\nminutes of looking, I noticed\na solo competitor much older\nthan ourselves who we had\npassed on the way up, exiting\nthe area in a different direc-tion. Predictably, he had proceeded straight to the checkpoint and expended far less\nenergy.\nThe run continued like this\nfor the next two hours, and\nwe admired some spectacular views on the way, even\nmanaging enough words for\na debate about the utility of\nwaterproof socks (I\u2019m buying\nsome after this). Surprisingly\nwe visited every checkpoint\nand sprinted back to the start\nlocation on time, cheered on\nat the end by our friend who\nhad so easily found the marker post earlier.\nSo we were leading as we\nbegan the cycling, and I was\nbeginning to think this adventure racing lark was easy. Big\nmistake. My calves cramped\nup and I had to be helped even\nto collapse to the floor, where\nI spent 15 minutes, probably\nwhinging in a less than manly\nfashion. Anyone who has had\ncramp like this will know what\nI\u2019m talking about, and if you\ndon\u2019t then you are missing\nnothing, but for the next three\nhours I was forced to quickly\nrelax my calves every time\ncramp threatened to paralyse\nthem.\nDespite this, the mountain\nbiking was awesome fun, with\ntechnical downhill forested\nareas, where my technique\nconsisted of nothing more\nthan holding on and releasing\nthe brakes more, the muddier it got. Our inexperience\nshowed in terms of our overall\nposition, as we concentrated\ntoo much on scoring points,\nmeaning that we got back late\nwith a heavy deduction. This\nreally didn\u2019t matter though,\nand we finished a more than\nrespectable second overall,\nwith Imperial\u2019s other pair\n\u2013 Dan and Matthew \u2013 doing\nbrilliantly and winning the\nwhole thing.\nThe few walkers that we\npassed certainly looked\namused by our exertions,\nand you too may think this all\nsounds like an idiotic thing to\ndo. In some respects I can\u2019t\nargue with that! But I found it\ndifficult to be stressed about\nthe little unimportant things\non Monday morning, having\npushed myself near my limits\nthe previous day. It\u2019s like Ed\nNorton said: after Fight Club,\neverything else got the volume turned down. Adventure\nracing was no fight club, and\nis accessible to anyone who is\nmoderately fit, as was proved\nby me managing to finish\na race. You may still think\nI\u2019m mad, but I urge anyone\ntempted to give it a go: it is\nnot about extreme endurance\n(at this level anyway).\nSome highlights of the trip:\n\u2022 Witnessing a student adventure racer\u2019s (Dan) breakfast\nat 5am: Jaffa Cakes and a\nvalue Swiss roll, washed down\nwith some value coke.\n\u2022 Passing a herd of deer running in the opposite direction.\n\u2022 Consulting the map and\nrealising we were taking the\nhigh road (ie going uphill),\nnot the low road (down).\nNumerous times.\n\u2022 Sprinting up to a cairn in\nmisty and wet conditions\nas bright sunshine abruptly\nappeared (sounds pretty\ncheesy \u2013 all I can say is give\nit a go!)\n\u2022 Chatting to other competitors afterwards: I felt\nstrangely bonded to people\nwho had gone through the\nsame experience, and when\nI was suffering with cramp\nevery person who passed by\nenquired as to my health. One\nrandom female competitor\neven stopped to give me a calf\nmassage.\nI heard somewhere that\nbeing a talented endurance\nathlete requires a deficit in\nshort term memory in order\nto keep returning to the event!\nI have great memories of my\nfirst adventure race, and,\nthinking about it, perhaps I\ncould manage that eight hour\nrace later in the year...\nFor more information, visit\nwww.sleepmonsters.com.\nContact the Outdoor Club\nat outdoor@ic.ac.uk or\ndaniel.carrivick@ic.ac.uk\nOUTDOOR CLUB\nAdventure racing: running, cycling\nand Jaffa Cakes\n\u201cYou may think we\u2019re mad...\u201d \u2013 Imperial adventure racers Rob and Arnaud\nWinner: Imperial\u2019s Dan Carrivick\n\n"

This was followed\nby a sudden counter-attack\nfrom formidable X-girl Maria,\nwho abandoned any passing\nmalarkey and booted it from\nthe halfway line into the goal.\nNo messing!\nThere were amazing skills\non the pitch from both teams\nand the score was even until,\nwith a trademark run, Chin\ntook on the opposition sin-gle-handed and finished by\nbeautifully sliding the ball\nhome, putting the current\ngirls up by two goals to one.\nThis was followed by another\ncurrent girls attack, this time\nfrom the season\u2019s top scorer Aysha, taking on all the\ndefenders and setting herself\nup for a little tap across the\ngoal line!\nMel and Helene put the\n\u2018grr\u2019 into \u2018grudge match\u2019 and\nreminded us of how it used to\nbe done with some crunching\ntackles.\nThe current girls, feeling\na bit too confident with their\n3-1 lead, couldn\u2019t handle a\ncounter-attack from last season\u2019s club captain Lou, who\nbrought the X-girls back in\nthe game at 3-2 behind. But\nAysha did the team proud yet\nagain and got another goal\nfor the current girls, bringing\nthe score to 4-2.\nWith some great passing\nbetween the immensely skilful X-girls Nona and Sophie,\nthe ball was kept away from\nany of the current girls, ending in a great through ball to\nClare and another goal to cut\nthe deficit to 4-3.\nThe teams were getting\ntired and over an hour had\npassed of continuous and\nintense play.

    "content": "Cloud Atlas has silver lining\nJenny Jopson gives out five of our very precious stars\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005\n16\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nIt has been a long time since I read\na book that insists on intruding so\noften into my life, rudely barging\ninto otherwise sensible conversation and forcing me to evangelise\non its behalf. I find myself name-dropping David Mitchell\u2019s third\nnovel with promiscuous abandon,\nbanging on to complete strangers\nlike a belligerent drunk that they\nmust, simply must read this book,\nonly to be flummoxed when they\ndemand a description of said genius work. How does one begin to\ndescribe a book that so transcends\nthe constraints of style and genre?\nCloud Atlas follows Mitchell\u2019s\nhighly praised Ghostwritten and\nnumber9dream, and was the winner of Richard and Judy\u2019s Read\nof the Year 2005. But don\u2019t let that\nput you off. Cloud Atlas, apart from\nhaving some of the most beautiful cover art ever to grace a dust\njacket, is a work of breathtaking\nimagination and virtuosity.\nIt is perhaps best described as\nsix mini-novels in one, each set in\ndifferent eras and countries, and\nwritten in widely differing styles.\nWe begin with the seafaring journal of Adam Ewing, a 19th century\nAmerican reflecting on the nature\nof colonialism as he waits on the\nChatham Islands off New Zealand\nfor his ship to sail. But just as\nwe become absorbed in Adam\u2019s\nstory, we are uprooted, mid-sen-tence, and whisked forward in time\nto 1930s Brussels. Here we meet\ndisgraced music student Robert\nFrobisher, and through his acerbic\nand caustically witty letters follow\nhis attempts to ingratiate himself\nwith his hero \u2013 the ageing, cantankerous composer Vyvyan Ayrs.\nThe pattern continues, as\nMitchell takes us on a whirlwind\njourney across continents and cen-turies, via detective story, memoir and sci-fi fantasy, and sets us\ndown in a post-apocalyptic future\nfor a fireside storytelling session.\nBut although chronologically the\nend, this is in fact only the middle of the book \u2013 like a Russian\ndoll taken apart and then reas-sembled, Mitchell proceeds to take\nus back through time, completing each narrative where he left\noff, until we find ourselves again\nsailing the ocean waves with Mr\nEwing. This may sound tricksy, but\nthe book is so much more than the\nsum of its parts \u2013 each narrative is\ncleverly linked to its predecessor,\nand as each one is concluded, our\nknowledge from the future serves\nto invest the interlocking stories\nwith a significance and an emotional power that would otherwise\nhave been absent.\nMitchell\u2019s intention is to expose\nthe will to power that unites mankind across ages, and the universality of atrocities committed by\nman against man in the pursuit\nof dominance and possession. His\nambition is a bold one, but one that\nis effective in demonstrating that\nalthough each person\u2019s life may\nappear insignificant in the grand\nscheme of things, ultimately we all\nhave the potential to make a difference to our present and future.\nIf this all seems a little too new-age for serious Imperial tastes,\nMitchell never comes across as\nheavy-handed or sanctimonious.\nThe novel manages to deliver\nmoments of poignancy, suspense\nand hilarity \u2013 the memoir of cantankerous present-day publisher\nTimothy Cavendish, which chronicles his unwilling incarceration in\na nursing home populated by the\n\u2018shuffling undead\u2019 and his attempts\nto escape his captors, made me\nlaugh out loud. Elsewhere the\nfuturistic tale of Somni, a cloned\nfabricant enslaved in a fast food\nrestaurant, is both a chilling reflection on the extreme consequences\nof consumerism and a biting satire on present-day McDonalds cul-ture.\nCloud Atlas has been criticised\nby a few who found it confusing,\npretentious or just plain unread-able. While such an original work\nis sure to have its detractors, to\ndismiss it on the basis of its subversion of literary conventions is to\ntragically miss out. The sixth tale,\nrecounted in a devastated future\nthat has reverted to medieval feu-dalism, employs an invented dialect\npeppered with words like \u2018yibber\u2019,\n\u2018magicky\u2019 and \u2018knucklin\u2019. Initially,\nit is hard going and might seem\nan experiment in creative writing\ngone too far, but persevere and it\nbecomes poetic and absorbing.\nThe novel\u2019s structure can also\nbe frustrating and emotionally\ndemanding. This is a sprawling\nbanquet of a book, employing an\narmy of characters and necessitating much cross-referencing as the\nweb of disparate narratives grows\nmore extensive, complex and inter-linked. Each narrative continues\nfor just long enough to draw you in,\nbefore stopping abruptly at a pivotal moment and being replaced by\nanother whose imposition you temporarily resent. However, it is not\nlong before Mitchell\u2019s consummate\nskill and control over his material\nacts to immerse you all over again.\nMitchell playfully anticipates\nhis critics through the voice of\nRobert Frobisher, whose composition for six overlapping soloists,\nCloud Atlas Sextet, has a structure\nthat mirrors the novel\u2019s own. He\nmuses on the public reception of\nhis masterpiece: \u201cRevolutionary or\ngimmicky? Shan\u2019t know until it\u2019s\nfinished.\u201d The novel is ultimately\nboth, but if you are prepared to\ndiscard the standard conventions\nof storytelling you will discover a\nwork of astounding originality that\nwill not disappoint.\nAfter a term dominated by the\nhorrors of revision, what better\nway to escape the tyranny of exams\nthan by embarking upon a literary voyage across continents and\ncenturies? Cloud Atlas is not literary fast food, but a novel to be\nsavoured, to linger over, and \u2013 like\nany truly great meal \u2013 share with\nyour friends. Oh, there I go again.\nLook, for the sake of my social life\nand my friends\u2019 sanity, just read\nthis book. Please.\nCloud Atlas\nby David Mitchell\n(Sceptre)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPacha gets dirty\nNo, \u2018Posha\u2019 hasn\u2019t lost its chic. And the crowd haven\u2019t turned into munters. We\u2019re talking about\nthe music, courtesy of Circo Loco\nclubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThose of you who have heard of\nDC10 and Circo Loco are probably few and far between, but when\ntheir showcase comes to London,\nit\u2019s guaranteed to be an amazing\nnight.\nDC10 is a clubbers\u2019 club hidden\naway on the barrens of Ibiza. Under\nthe flight path of planes to and from\nthe island, it hosts many of the biggest names on the white isle. The\nbeauty of the club is the fact that it\nis open during the day and so the\nnormal scally beer boys that people\nusually associate with Ibiza either\ndon\u2019t know about it or don\u2019t know\nhow to get there!\nCirco Loco houses the best\nmusic on the island. The terrace\u2019s\nspeakers blast out melodic deep\nhouse beats and funky rhythms\nwhile inside has a unique blend of\ndirty bass and acid like sounds. You\nwill not hear the majority of the\nchoons anywhere else \u2013 the club\nprides itself on being underground\nand individual.\nLine-ups announced usually only\ninclude the residents, but many big\nname DJs turn up with their record\nbags and get involved on the decks\nfree of charge and unannounced.\nThis adds to the atmosphere, which\nis already raising the roof and oozing out of the fire exits.\nThis is what they tried to emulate\nin London, at Pacha. I had my doubts\nwhen I heard about it. Having a dirty\nunderground clubbing experience\nhosted in the expensive interior of\none of London\u2019s \u2018poshest\u2019 clubs just\ndidn\u2019t sound right. Fortunately, I was\nwrong.\nThe lights had all been turned\noff and the bass was cranked up\nto ear bleeding, heart shuddering\nlevels (the way it always should be).\nThe star act of the night was the\ngorgeous Jo Mills, and she did not\ndisappoint, spewing out filthy house\nwith hard deep bass lines \u2013 music\nso dirty that it disgusted many of\nthe usual visitors to the club. These\nwere no doubt looking forward\nto the usual happy, smiley funky\nhouse that Pacha usually plays.\nGlancing across the dance floor I\ncould see the real clubbers, standing with there eyes closed, imagining being back in Ibiza, soaked\nin sweat and surrounded by gay\nGerman body builders with their\ntops off (well maybe not the last bit\nbut those of you that have been to\nDC10 will know exactly what I\u2019m\ntalking about).\nThe sounds cannot be described\nby any one genre \u2013 the techno-esque\nbass lines were as hard as nails but\nas slow as house, yet Mills\u2019 choppy,\nmessy mixing provided an amazing\nbreakbeat element that never failed\nto take my breath away.\nHass Jishi\nCirco Loco\nPacha\n\u00a320\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nJo Mills: gorgeous\n\n"

That\u2019s what I\nhope you\u2019ve all been singing along\nto in eager anticipation of my rumi-natory musings this week. Musings\non a meeting with Imperial\u2019s finest\nsocial analyser, the inimitable Mr\nGeraldes.\nInimitable, you say? I\u2019d like to\nthink so, since my meetings with\ngentlemen of the Latin disposition\nwere previously limited to crude hiphop videos and bad J-Lo movies,\nnot to mention my mother\u2019s hideous Julio Iglesias CD collection, to\nwhich I\u2019d rather not give a smidgen\nof recognition. I also hadn\u2019t had the\nprivilege of hanging out with a biomedical engineering student before\nI met Diogo \u2013 I hold my hands up to\nassuming it ranked among the \u2018spot\nthe non-Chinese person\u2019 courses\nbased in the engineering faculty, and\nstraightforwardly denounced any\nchances of having company from\nhere. (Well, it\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it \u2013 non-EU\ninternational students tend to hang\nout in incestuous packs; I should\nknow having been ignored by half\nmy hall compatriots back in Wilson\nin 2001!)\nSo what was he like then?\nCharming, talkative and funny, albeit decidedly arrogant in the nicest\npossible way. Diogo is undoubtedly\nhandsome, in the rugged way all\nFootball Italia fans like their men\n(think Luis Amor Rodriguez from\nDream Team), and chivalrous. Our\ntopics of conversation included\nlife in Lisbon, life at Wilson, life in\nLondon and partying.\nI\u2019ve discovered a similar arrogance in many affluent gentlemen\nfrom cultures where the female is\nsubservient. It\u2019s not intentional,\nmore a bravado-type front. Either\nway, it\u2019s slightly unappreciated by a\nfemale capable of making and holding her own opinion when it comes\nto a relationship context, which, my\nfair readers, won\u2019t be the case with\nme and our dearest social analyser,\nfor these reasons and more.\nSo we\u2019re back to square one...\nor so it seems. Stormy\u2019s one-night\nstand with the Oxford clitophobe\n(he wouldn\u2019t go down on me, so I\nkicked him out onto the streets) has\nled to begging and pleading of the\nmost desperate kind. Clitophobe,\nwho incidentally owns a pyramidal\npenis, hated being kissed with a\ntongue and failed to see the point\nin a Brazilian, would like to have a\nsecond chance.\nSecond chances are all very well\nif you\u2019re willing to experiment and\ncompromise; something that he, the\nking of Oxford Mechsoc, failed to\ndo. Stormies do not go down on you\nif you refuse to go down on them.\nLaming out and snoring once you\u2019ve\nhad your fun does not do you any\nfavours, along with endless begging\nand pleading emails and phone calls\nto tell me how great I am. Egostroking is for the insecure. Try a\nnew flex.\nSpeaking of new flexes, I\u2019d like\nto tell you that I got mistaken for a\nfresher by a Busted lookalike trio in\nthe first year of ICSM when I accosted them in the midst of a diner on\nKings\u2019 Road. Flattering isn\u2019t it, when\nyou\u2019re about to enter your fifth year\nof perjury?\nMindless charm aside, these fair\nchappies failed to recognise that people from different years do socialise\nin the medschool. They also failed to\nrealise that the \u2018future doctor flex\u2019 of\nstaring at a girl for 20 minutes wearing an ICSM clubs and socs top may\noccasionally fail when the girl you\u2019re\nfixating upon is going to be making\nyou do her legwork around a local\nhospital in 730 days and counting.\nAdventures make the world go\nround.

Otherwise they would bring the\nwhole rugby society or a cricket bat\nwith them. Maybe they help each\nother with their makeup? I find that\nhard to believe, because being a\ngirl (or a metrosexual) is all about\nkeeping the secrets of beauty and\nstyle away from our \u2018opponents\u2019 and\ntrying to beat them at every oppor-tunity.\nThey say that men are perverts\nbecause all they think about is sex,\ngirls and sex (this is so not true: we\nalso think about beer, Angelina Jolie\nand making love), but the same happens with girls: they are horny 70%\nof their time, and the other 30% they\nspend thinking about how horny\nthey were before! So they gather\nin the bathroom and start exchanging impressions about the guy that\nworks in the sandwich shop, the\nbloke-that-smiled-at-them-right-before-throwing-up-and-collapsing-due-to-the-amount-of-alcohol-he-drank or the sexy hunk from the\nthird floor in the library who won\u2019t\nstop staring at them (even if all he\nwants is a share of their university\nphysics book).\nMystery 2: Where are\nSaddam\u2019s weapons of mass\ndestruction?\nI\u2019m sorry but I only included this\ntopic to make my column look\nrespectful and serious. How can I\nfind something that seemed harder\nto find than life on other planets?\nMoving on...\nMystery 3: Where do all the\numbrellas go?\nThis world has six thousand million inhabitants. Almost half of them\nhave had umbrellas at some point\nin their lives. But, let me think for\na bit:\n1. A big percentage of people have\numbrellas.\n2. Everyone loses at least one\numbrella per lifetime.\n3. Nobody finds umbrellas.\nSo where the hell do they go? Do\nthey have their own refugee camp,\nUmbrellaland? Are they hiding\nfrom us? And why would they do\nit? Who\u2019s stealing them? Where are\nthey kept?\nI thought I was audacious enough\nto answer to this mystery, but it blatantly has no solution!\nAnd finally...\nMystery 4: Who is Stormy\nWoods?\nEveryone who reads her column\nwonders what does she look like,\nhow does she dress and where does\nshe go clubbing. Yesterday I had the\nopportunity to solve this mystery in\nHigh Street Ken, but I won\u2019t reveal\nmuch (since I was begged not to).\nSo I\u2019ll let you keep your own sexual\nor envious thoughts without disturbing them, feeling delighted for being\nthe chosen one.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nNUS shenanigans\nYesterday I had the pleasure of\nsitting through a meeting of the\nPresidents of the Aldwych Group\n(the students\u2019 unions of the Russell\nGroup of 19 leading research univer-sities). One of the more contentious\npoints of discussion was an update\nfrom Cardiff University on the situation of higher education funding\nin Wales \u2013 which actually required\nthe NUS Vice President (Education)\nto have to walk out as she wasn\u2019t\nallowed to hear criticism of NUS\nstaff.\nTo cut a long story short, Cardiff\nwere upset that the NUS Wales\nPresident and his staff had been\nlobbying members of the Welsh\nAssembly to vote in favour of introducing top-up fees in Wales. This was\nagainst NUS Wales policy but was in\nline with the NUS Wales\u2019 political\naffiliations (he is a Labour activist).\nWhilst it\u2019s not for me to comment\non what policy NUS Wales should\nor shouldn\u2019t have on tuition fees in\nWales, I always despair when I hear\nof student politicians putting their\nparty political allegiances before\ntheir students. For me it underlines\njust how lucky we are not to be affiliated to the NUS and all the political\nshenanigans that go with it.\nCycling safety\nMore eagle-eyed visitors to Beit\nQuad this last week will have noticed\nthat the Imperial Standard has been\nflying at half mast for the last few\ndays. This was in respect to Apijak\nSrivannavit, a student who was\nkilled cycling on Cromwell Road.\nThis follows the death in March of a\nmuch-loved ICT staff member, again\ncycling on the Cromwell Road. There\nhave also been several reports in\nthis paper of cyclists being injured.\nUnion officers have for some time\nbeen worried about the safety of\nCromwell Road, which is part of the\nA4. Having driven in to London along\nthat road many times (usually from\nSilwood Park) I can understand it\nfrom a driver\u2019s point of view. You\ncome in, from the M4, and it\u2019s mentally difficult to get out of the \u2018speed\nway\u2019 mind set, especially when you\nwant to get home quickly. But that\u2019s\nnot a good reason to compromise\npedestrian safety.\nWe have tried to promote cycling\nproficiency courses before \u2013 and\nwere offering some for free with\nKensington & Chelsea Council.\nHowever, the onus isn\u2019t just on\ncyclists to cycle safely. Transport for\nLondon must now take appropriate\nmeasures (traffic calming, dedicated lanes, etc) to make the A4 safer\nfor motorists, cyclists and pedestrians alike. How many more fatalities\ndoes it need for the bureaucrats\nin the Mayor\u2019s office to sit up and\nlisten?\nSouth Kensington sports\nfacilities\nAs many of you are aware, Imperial\nwill have a dearth of sports facilities\nat the South Kensington campus\nonce Southside closes at the end of\nJune. The new \u00a318m sports centre is\nunlikely to be fully operational until\nJanuary. That will mean increased\npressure on other large hall spaces\naround College for indoor sports.\nWe did look at relocating the fitness gym to the Union gym but that\nwould have encroached on the only\nremaining gymnasium on campus.\nWith Linstead hall residents having\nevening meals in Sherfield, things\nwill be pretty tight.\nUltimately things will be much\nbetter when the new sports centre\ndoes open. The new swimming pool\nand fitness gym will be free to all\nstudents and staff as the College\u2019s\nDirector of Communications\nannounced in his letter last week.\nThere will be increased charges for\nclubs and societies to use the sports\nhall space, but this will be much\nless than the cost to the College of\nproviding the free fitness gym and\nswimming pool. Overall the College\nwill be spending more on students\nbut the Union will have some difficult choices to make with respect to\nour large provision of indoor sports\nclubs.\nElections reminder\nFinally, don\u2019t forget. We have positions open for election, including the\nnew Deputy President (Graduate\nStudents). Find out how to stand for\nelection by visiting www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/elections.\nPolitics, cycling and sport\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nFive things you didn\u2019t know about\nthe Summer Ball\n1. This year the Union has secured\nover \u00a330,000 to be spent on the\nSummer Ball. That\u2019s a massive 10\ntimes more than last year.\n2. Every single penny from the ticket\nyou buy goes back into the Summer\nBall to make it bigger and better for\nyou!\n3. If you buy your ticket earlier rather\nthan later, this gives us more time to\narrange Summer Ball \u2018extras\u2019 such\nas a chocolate fountain, wandering\nmagicians and \u2018Hollywood\nlook-alikes\u2019.\n4. Every year most people leave it until\nthe last few days before they buy their\nticket for the Summer Ball.\n5. So don\u2019t leave buying your ticket\nuntil the last moment \u2013 go and buy it\nnow so we can make the Summer Ball\neven more amazing than it\u2019s already\ngoing to be.\nThe joy of... plagiarism\nThere has been a lot of comment in\nthis newspaper lately (front page,\nFelix 1323) regarding the topic of\nplagiarism. This has been echoing around the heady chambers of\nCollege\u2019s Senate and its sub-com-mittees (on which I sit), and various\nUnion committees in the last few\nweeks.\nThe College takes a very dim\nview of plagiarism, the act of taking\nwithout referencing from someone\nelse\u2019s writing or speech. If caught,\nstudents can face anything from\nhaving to redo the piece of work\nto being forbidden from ever sitting any exams in the University of\nLondon, depending on the severity\nof the case.\nSome students have expressed\nconcern that they\u2019re not sure\nexactly what constitutes plagia-rism. Directors of Studies are\nalways keen to talk about the issue\nin their introductory speeches,\nand all students are given a copy\nof the booklet Learning to Learn,\nwhich is also hidden deep inside\nthe College website: www.ic.ac.uk/\ne d u c a t i o n a l d e v e l o p m e n t / e -learning/learningtolearn.htm.\nRegarding the incidents in the\nDepartment of Chemistry, student\nrepresentatives approached me,\nworried that the department might\nhave acted heavy-handedly in the\ntiming of its \u2018clampdown\u2019 in which\nthey urged students to come forward if they wanted to confess to\nany instances of plagiarism. I took\nthis up with Professor Tom Welton,\nthe Director of Studies, and I was\nsatisfied that, in the situation, the\ndepartment acted reasonably. In this\ncase, it did seem quite widespread,\nand about a dozen people came forward having committed plagiarism\nof some degree or other.\nMany people have asked what\nthe College is doing about it. Some\nstudents feel that the onus is on\nlecturers to develop imaginative\nways of preventing or discouraging\nplagiarism in the setting of their\ncoursework. For instance, I know\nof one piece of coursework that has\nunique data which depends on the\nstudent\u2019s College ID number. Yes,\nit will involve more work to think\nup new coursework, such that it\u2019s\nno longer possible to simply utilise\nthe networks of students who are\nthe guardians of coursework submissions dating back to before you\nwere born, but the academic community must face facts and accept\nthat prevention is better than rem-edy. Markers have at their disposal\nhigh-tech software, capable of comparing essays to work that\u2019s available online or has been submitted\nin the past.\nStudents are obviously under a\nlot of pressure (from families, spon-sors, peers, lecturers and them-selves) to succeed in their stud-ies, and some go to any lengths to\ndo so. Obviously, no-one ever said\nthat degrees from Imperial grow\non trees, and College figures such\nas the Pro-Rector (Educational\nQuality) are keen to point out that\nworkload has not increased over the\nyears and that it is reasonable to\nexpect what we do expect from our\nstudents.\nThe financial pressure on\nstudents today is such that\nmany have to undertake part-time\nemployment on top of their studies and any Union activities in\nwhich they may be involved. I have\nheard reports from students having to work as much as 20 hours\na week to fund their studies. I\nsuppose this is an appropriate\npoint to mention the College\u2019s\nStudent Support Officer (student.\nsupport@ic.ac.uk) who administers\nthe Hardship Fund. The Union\u2019s\nInformation and Advice Centre\n(advice@ic.ac.uk) is also able to\noffer advice on financial and employment issues.\nThe bottom line is, in some depart-ments, plagiarism has become a\n\u2018social crime\u2019 that has been normal-ised, and it\u2019s necessary to challenge\nthis attitude before the College can\nmove on.\nSAM RORKE\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION & WELFARE)\nUNCLE SAM\nBy the Summer Ball committee\nEditorial Comment and the Advice Service will return next week\n\n"

Vaibhav and\nKarthik opened the batting\nfor Imperial and got off to\na good solid start. Vaibhav\ncontinued his season of good\nform, driving beautifully in\nthe arc between cover and\nmid-off and dispatching anything fractionally short.\nKarthik fell leg before\nto Chris Plummer, which\nbrought Pete Munro to the\ncrease. Vabs and Pete put on\na good partnership, which\nwas marked by aggressive\nrunning between the wick-ets. Aussie Pete was in good\ntouch and looking good for a\nbig total when he fell with the\nscore on 87, bringing Almaher\nto the wicket.\nThe platform had been set\nand Imperial were on course\nfor a score of around 200.\nLittle did Royal Holloway\nknow what they were in for!\nAl began beautifully, punching off the back foot for four\nand within no time was on 25\nwith four boundaries stroked\nalong the ground. Then the\ncarnage began.\nIn the afternoon heat, Al\u2019s\ninnings brought a downpour\nof sixes. His first one was\nprobably the biggest of the\nlot, deposited miles away\ninto the vast empty spaces\noutside the ground. The arc\nbetween mid-on and mid-wicket received maximum\nattention as the fielding side\nwere left gasping for breath.\nAnything full disappeared;\nanything short was pum-melled. It was anything but\nslogging, just batting at its\nbrilliant best. It was breathtaking to watch for the sheer\nquality of the strokeplay and\nthe frantic pace at which the\nruns were scored.\nAl rocketed from 50 to 82 in\nthe space of just nine balls,\nwith one particular over going\nfor 26 runs. In the midst of\nthis mayhem Vab, who played\nhis role to perfection in the\npartnership, compiled a very\ngood half century before\nbeing finally dismissed for 53.\nJibran and Jacob perished\nin the quest for quick runs.\nSuraj began well with two\nconsecutive boundaries and\noffered good support to Al,\nrunning hard between the\nwickets and ensuring Al got\nmost of the strike.\nAl was on 97 not out, and\nexpectation was high all\naround the ground. Everyone\nknew the hundred was just\na matter of time away. The\nonly doubt was whether\nit was going to be a six or\na four to take him to it. Al\nhit the ball straight past the\nbowler for four and there\nwere huge cheers from team\nmates watching and genuine\napplause from the Holloway\nfielders.\nIt was one of the finest 100s\nHarlington had seen, and was\nscored in just 37 deliveries!\nThe dominating fashion in\nwhich he batted was amazing\nto watch. Al continued in his\nquest for runs and was finally\ndismissed in the 37th over for\n120. During Al\u2019s stay at the\ncrease a whopping 150 runs\nwere scored in 15 overs at 10\nruns an over. Avi hit the final\nball for 4 and Imperial ended\nwith a gigantic score of 270\nfor six in 40 overs.\nBy the time Holloway had\ntheir turn to bat, they were\nmentally exhausted. Anand\ngot the first wicket with Jacob\ntaking the catch at gully.\nJibran\u2019s accurate late swinging deliveries once again\nproved more than just a challenge for the batsmen who\nhad no clue whatsoever. Luck,\nhowever, wasn\u2019t on Jibran\u2019s\nside as the slip cordon spilt\nseveral half chances.\nImperial continued to attack\nwith three slips and a gully\nand Holloway struggled to\nkeep up with the required run\nrate. They then moved along\nto 61 for one in 17 overs with\ntheir batsmen hardly scoring\nanything off the face of the\nbat before Avi struck, getting\nthrough the defences of their\nopening batsman.\nAli Najefi picked up a couple of quick wickets with\ndeliveries that swung in late\nto leave Holloway reeling at\n79 for four. It only got worse\nfor the visitors from there on.\nVabs came on to bowl and one\nbatsman followed another\nback to the pavilion as they\nchoked against the swinging\nball accompanied by clever\nchanges of pace.\nWith his third and fourth\nwickets off consecutive deliv-eries, Vabs was on a hat-trick\nbut Holloway survived it. The\nfinal wicket fell when the ball\nfittingly went straight into\nthe hands of Al at short mid-wicket, to give Vabs a richly\ndeserved five wicket haul.\nAs a result of their tremendous win, Imperial seconds\ntopped their league and are\nnow just one game away from\nthe final.\nImperial seconds have gone\nfrom strength to strength, a\nclosely-knit team playing for\neach other and looking to go\nthe entire distance in this\ntournament. The team would\nlike to thank Robert Fitch for\nvolunteering to score during\nthe games and really appreciate the support.\nCRICKET\ning deliveries once again ate the support.\nImperial batsman Almaher Shelly hits one of seven sixes on his way to a match-winning innings of 120\nPHOTO: JIBRAN AHMED\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005 5\nMy uncle, the global warming sceptic\nAn Imperial alumnus and the first elected president of the students\u2019 union, Piers Corbyn is among the\nworld\u2019s leading global warming sceptics. Zo\u00eb Corbyn talked to her uncle about his views\nPiers Corbyn, Imperial\nCollege educated astrophysicist and students\u2019 union president 1969-1970, makes tea in\nthe basement of Delta House\non Borough High Street.\nThe kitchen smells of paint\nand drains. Fred Millson\nphones about housing strug-gles. The tea stews. Piers is\n57 years old, tall, lean, pale\nand mildly unkempt. He has\ngreying curls and glasses that\nhe rarely removes. Today he\nwears a bright blue shirt.\nHe wants a copy of the latest New Scientist. It contains\nsomething quite important\n\u2013 a discussion of the sceptics\u2019\nposition, an expos\u00e9 on the\n\u2018hockey stick\u2019 graph that purports to show temperatures\nhigher than they have been\nfor 1000 years. The graph is\na symbol of what has occupied Piers\u2019 mind for a very\nlong time and will continue\nto occupy it certainly for the\nnext five hours.\nSince 1990, Piers\u2019 company,\nWeather Action, has been\nforecasting extreme weather\nevents months and years in\nadvance. The forecasts aren\u2019t\nalways right, but their success\nrate is impressive. The method is lodged in two places \u2013 in\nPiers\u2019 head and in a secret\nsafety deposit box. The business has grown and shrunk,\ngone through dot.com rises\nand dot.com crashes and\nstock exchange listings and\ndelistings, and will likely do\nso again. But for the moment\nit\u2019s in a period of \u201cright sizing\u201d, hence the recent move\nto Delta House.\nWeather Action\u2019s hub is\nnumber 19d \u2013 through triple\ndoors on the third floor land-ing. But 19d can\u2019t hold eve-rything. So the photocopier\nlanguishes outside the door,\nbacked against a banner of\nsolar corona. Weather Action\nfiles fill the shelves that fill\nthe corridor that disappears\nto the communal courtyard.\nThe walls are pin-drop thin.\nBut Piers does more than\nrun Weather Action from 19d.\nHe is also a leading climate\nsceptic, as confirmed by the\nRussian government.\nFor Piers, our carbon dioxide pollution is not changing\nworld temperatures in any\nsignificant way. Not making\na blind bit of difference. Any\nincreaseintemperaturebeing\nexperienced is an entirely\nnatural phenomenon.\nPiers\u2019 theory is that the real\nclimate culprits are particles\nfrom the sun \u2013 the ones making up the solar wind and\nstreaming earthwards to\ncreate lovely auroras at the\nnorth and south poles. They\ninteract with the earth\u2019s magnetic field, driving the world\u2019s\nweather patterns and altering the global temperature.\nPartly delayed and over long\ntime scales, world temperature then largely controls\ncarbon dioxide levels. Any\nenhancing effects from our\ngreenhouse gas pollution are\nsmall and second order. His\ndata is based on a unique\nreworking of standard figures\nand published papers.\nIt means, for Piers, that\ncarbon dioxide centred\nglobal warming theory is\nquasi-mystical \u2013 more suggestive of divine intervention or climate-homeopathy.\nDangers of human-induced\nclimate change are alarmist\nnonsense; the Kyoto protocol political absurdity. He\u2019s\nannoyed about how dishonest the other side is, that the\nglobal warming scientists will\nnot engage in public debate.\nInstead they put environmental freaks up, who won\u2019t discuss the science and bandy\nabout figures for the numbers\nof scientists that agree with\nthem. Yada, yada, yada.\nPiers and his mug of tea\nglide to the right of the photocopier and into room 19d.\nHe manoeuvres into his\ndesk. It forms an \u2018L\n\u2019 shape\nwith the desk of his research\nassistant, Judy Humphrey.\nColoured files and empty\npeanut butter jars protrude\nfrom the shelves that coat the\nwalls. The room is like the\nfinal stages of a Tetris game\n\u2013 there is no space left.\nHe considers the day\nahead. There\u2019s a farmer who\nwants a monthly forecast,\nthe liquidation of Weather\nAction Limited to be finalised before the vampires bite,\nemails from the climate scep-tics website to sort through\nand the paper to Geophysical\nResearch Letters.\nJudy arrives, but without\nthe New Scientist. She has\npretty, sprite-like features and\nis a recent planetary science\ngraduate. She removes her\nchunky footwear and boots up\nher iMac. Piers can\u2019t pay her,\nbut the interesting nature of\nthe work seems to partially\ncompensate while she looks\nfor a PhD position. She met\nPiers through her dad.\nPiers and Judy eat humous\nand cheese and tomato\nsandwiches. The computers\nadd to the terrible heat of\nthe room. They make jokes\nabout greenhouses and open\nthe windows. Judy asks about\nprogress on the paper.\n\u201cI\u2019ve sent a summary,\u201d\nreplies Piers.\nSomething weird happens\nto the correlation between\nworld temperatures and\nsolar particle effects in 1995.\nThere\u2019s a divergence. World\ntemperature goes one way\nand geomagnetic activity\ngoes another. But Piers and\nJudy have a theory. It was\nannounced at the Institute of\nPhysics lecture on 2 February.\nIt\u2019s a transpolar shift proc-ess. There\u2019s currently a rapid\nmotion of the magnetic north\npole towards the geographic\nnorth pole, producing extra\nwarming. A movement away\nwould give extra cooling. In\nthe next five to ten years they\nthink warming is likely to be\nmaintained as a transpolar\nshift occurs. This will be followed by the magnetic pole\nmoving away from the geographic pole, and considerable world cooling by 2040.\nNils-Axel Morner recommended they try Geophysical\nResearch Letters. He is a\nStockholm University professor who Piers saw last at the\nsceptics\u2019 conference on the 27\nJanuary. Nils-Axel\u2019s particular beef is the wildly exaggerated claims about sea level\nrises.\n\u201cDid they have a positive\nresponse?\u201d quizzes Judy.\n\u201cWell, the woman who\nwrote back said, \u2018I\u2019m not a\nscientist, just send it in\u2019 sort\nof thing. But I think it will get\npublished. Well the Russians\nhave asked for it anyway. I\u2019ve\ngot an email from Andrei\nIllarionov asking for it.\u201d\nAndrei Illarionov is Russian\npresident Vladimir Putin\u2019s\neconomic advisor.\nPiers likes talking about\nthe Russians. At Andrei\u2019s\ninvitation, he went to a conference in Moscow on the 7\nand 8th July 2004. The \u201cglobal\nwarming dogmatists\u201d were\npressuring the Russians to\nsign Kyoto. They \u2013 Sir John\nHoughton and Sir David King,\nrepresenting the British scientific establishment \u2013 talked\nthem into holding the conference to kindly lecture the\nRussians on the ills of carbon\ndioxide.\nIt was an imperialist\napproach, says Piers. But\nAndrei Illarionov recognised\nit and saw an opportunity to\nturn things on their head. He\ninvited seven leading scep-tics from around the world\n\u2013 including Piers \u2013 but kept\nit quiet. A few days before\nthe conference, Sir David\ngot wind and phoned up to\nsay that if the sceptics were\nthere, the British contingent\nwouldn\u2019t be coming. Illarionov\nresponded with words to\nthe effect: \u201cVery well, please\nyourself Sir David\u201d.\nIn the end, the British came\nanyway, but Sir David walked\nout soon after his speech\nsaying he had no time and\nhad to see a minister. Andrei\nIllarionov stood up and said\nthis behaviour was totally\nunacceptable. Piers got so\nwrapped up in the trip that\nhe missed the return flight\nto London and had to wait 17\nhours in Moscow airport.\nThe Russians eventually did\nsign Kyoto, but Piers thinks\nthey were just trying to outplay Europe.\nJudy enters data from a\nbook of astronomical tables.\nPiers examines today\u2019s\nemails from the climate sceptics\u2019 network. He\u2019s sure \u201cthe\nenemy\u201d has planted spies. To\ncircumvent them, he occasionally only responds to\nknown people.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are\nreferring to them as the\nenemy, we are not waging\nwar quite,\u201d says Judy.\nFor Piers, the real difficulty\nwith being a sceptic is that\nthe opposition immediately\nassumesheiswrong,ignorant\nand, most commonly, funded\nby oil companies. They are\nbig insults. But he would take\nthe funding if he could get it.\nThough he would, of course,\nalso ask for matched funding\nfrom the IPCC.\nAt a recent meeting, someone enquired whether the\noil companies were buying\nWeather Action forecasts.\nPiers replied that the largest\nbuyers were in fact farmers.\nBut the questioner wouldn\u2019t\nbelieve him and instead\ndescribed Mr Corbyn as being\n\u201cdangerous\u201d.\nIt\u2019s these sort of remarks\nthat lead Piers to provocative\ncomparisons, which he recognises are rather over the\ntop. He likens the campaign\nagainst the sceptics to that\nby the church against Galileo,\nthe global warmers to Hitler\u2019s\nresearch scientists. To his\ndelight, Piers was recently\nquoted in a magazine article\nas an example of a sceptic\nwho definitely shouldn\u2019t be\nquoted.\nBut he has no doubt that\npeople are being sacked and\nlosing funding for not believing in global warming, and\nresearch scientists in Europe\n\u2013 where the global warming\nlobby is centred \u2013 are doing\nvery nicely indeed thank you.\nFor Piers, it\u2019s not just the\nscience. The ramifications of\nthe global warmers\u2019 doctrine\nworry him equally. He\u2019s deeply concerned by the potential\nfor nuclear power and the\npotential for preventing third\nworld development that the\ndoctrine breeds. The hidden\nagenda, as Piers sees it, is to\nget high technology European\nindustries at the top and keep\nthem there \u2013 the developing\nworld beholden to expensive\ncarbon dioxide minimisation\ntechnology.\nBut it\u2019s irrelevant now, and\nthe paper and the Russians\nand New Scientist will have to\nwait. He\u2019s off to the accountant now before closing time\nto deal with the liquidation\nof Limited so\nthe vultures can be put to bed\nand the company can breathe\nfinancially. He finishes sorting out the farmer and smartens up with a tie.\n\u201cOur carbon dioxide\npollution is not changing world temperatures\nin any significant way.\nIt\u2019s not making a blind\nbit of difference\u201d\n\u201cPiers\u2019 theory is that\nthe real climate\nculprits are particles\nfrom the sun\u201d\n\u201cHe likens the\ncampaign against the\nsceptics to that by the\nchurch against Galileo\u201d\nCorbyn suggests changes in the Earth\u2019s temperature are due to solar particles\ninteracting with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\nPiers Corbyn: Imperial College Union chief in 1969 (left);\nglobal warming sceptic in 2005 (right)\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

In a season that has already seen the cream\nof operatic talent come to London,\nthe pace is definitely not letting up.\nAlong with Bartoli, Zhang, Villazon\nand Fleming are still to come.\nBartoli will be appearing in\nRossini\u2019s Il Turco in Italia. she\ntakes the role of Fiorilla, who inevitably will be the eponymous Turco\u2019s\nlove interest. As you can expect, the\nplot is full of confusion and intrigues\nwhich are all resolved amongst\nmuch comedy. (Yes, opera can be\nand often is really very funny).\nApart from the fact that an evening\nof Italian opera is hard to beat for\nentertainment value, this production is new and in the hands of two\ndirectors who have had great success with Rossini opera.\nAnd above all, Bartoli is a stupendous artist. She manages to make\nher voice do things that any other\nhuman being could only dream about\n\u2013 her range is fabulous, classed as a\nmezzo-soprano, she has a good bottom register and astounding range\nand clarity at the top of her voice.\nShe breezes through immeasurably\ntreacherous passages with such\nagility that if there ever was an\nadvertisement for good technique, it\nmust be her.\nThe opera runs until 11 June and\nsome tickets are still available, so I\nheartily urge you try to see it. Day\nseats are a good option if you don\u2019t\nmind queuing early in the morning.\nOtherwise, try the House\u2019s website,\nwww.roh.org.uk, or the box office on\n020 7304 4000.\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nOpen all hours\nNew York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art launches a curious new experiment\nRADIO\nWSP1 is hardly the most revealing\nof names. To be honest, it could\nallude to just about anything from a\ngovernment defence programme to\nthe name of a new games console,\nhowever, it is actually the name of\nthe world\u2019s first and only internet\narts radio station. And what a creative name it is at that.\nThis radio station is an initiative\nof the New York Museum of Modern\nArt (MoMA) and bills itself as a\n\u2018censorship free zone\u2019 where the\narts can be showcased and explored\nin a unique way. The station can\nbe reached through its website\nwww.wsp1.org. Programmes are\nscheduled to cover music, poetry,\ndiscussion and comment on important arts events across the world.\nWhile this may sound like a noble\nmission on which to embark (using\nBloomberg\u2019s money), I can\u2019t say I\u2019m\nsold on the product. Having come\nacross the station while trying to\nfind out about another arts event,\nand having since revisited it, the\nquality of the programming doesn\u2019t\nreally seem to justify its existence.\nOn my first visit I was treated to\nsome very \u2018interesting\u2019 music which\nI can\u2019t say anyone wishing to remain\nsane could have listened to for more\nthan about five or ten minutes \u2013\ndepending on the listener\u2019s initial\nstate of mind. On my next visit, I\nwas treated to a reading on the\nsubject of airports and airplanes. It\ntook me a while to realise that this\nwasn\u2019t one of those irritating, poetic\n\u2018Visit Australia\u2019 commercials. Again,\nhardly impressive; I may be a sucker for punishment, but I do feel that\nI should give the station one last\nchance \u2013 three strikes and it\u2019s out.\nI may not be the greatest fan of\nmore conceptual forms of art \u2013 such\nas that most frequently found on the\nschedule of WSP1 \u2013 but I don\u2019t hate\nit and I often find it quite intriguing\nand interesting (used in this case in\nthe positive sense). However, I do\nthink that it is most successful when\nit couples forms media together:\nsound with moving images, photography with the written word, even\na giant rug with an accompanying series of video images (yes, it\nsounds ridiculous, but I have seen\nit). What WSP1 manages to present\nis, at best, an incomplete product.\nIf such art forms do really interest you, your time would be much\nbetter spent at the Institute of\nContemporary Art (ICA, www.ica.\norg), the Tate Modern (www.tate.\norg), or at any number of galleries\nthroughoutthecountryandtheworld.\nIn fact, the Nordic countries and the\nBaltic states, in particular Finland,\ndo some truly awe-inspiring shows.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\n\u25cf For more information on the\nupcoming programming on WSP1,\njust go to their website, www.wsp1.\norg. If you want to have full control\nover what assaults your ears, just\nclose the initial window that appears\nasking you how you wish to listen\nand then access the remainder of\nthe website\u2019s content. The rest is\nup to you, and Felix accepts no\nresponsibility for any resulting\nheadaches.\n\u201cAnyone wishing to\nremain sane could\nnot have listened for\nmore than about five\nor ten minutes\u201d\nOn a bad day, this is all you may see of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Big Exhibitions mean\nqueues of biblical proportions; WSP1 has no queues\nTurkey in Europe \u2013\nit\u2019s nothing new\nThe divine Cecilia Bartoli is at Covent Garden\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005 15\nWSP1\nMuseum of Modern Art,\nNew York\nwww.wsp1.org\nIl Turco in Italia\nRossini\nRoyal Opera\nCovent Garden, WC2\nRunning to 15 June\nMUSICALS\nWhen it comes to musicals, I\u2019m\nstuck in something of a time warp.\nTo put it bluntly, anything premiered\nmuch after 1960 isn\u2019t really my thing.\nThough I must say with great disappointment that Urinetown, a new\nmusical, still hasn\u2019t made it to the\nWest End from Broadway. However,\nwhat has made it back to the London\nstage is Guys and Dolls.\nThis latest revival of Frank\nLoesser\u2019s 1955 musical is going to\nbe the \u2018must see\u2019 of the season. With\na score packed with great tunes and\na cast that would make any other\nshow envious, it\u2019s really not hard to\nsee why. Ewan McGregor, who has\nobviously been bitten by the song\nand dance bug following Moulin\nRouge and Down With Love, is back\non the West End stage, accompanied by the Tony Award winning Ally\nMcBeal actress Jane Krakowski.\nThe story centres on McGregor\u2019s\ncharacter, Sky Masterson, a small\ntime gambler, and a bet that he can\u2019t\nmake the next girl he sees fall in\nlove with him. Clearly we\u2019re not talking about deeply intellectual stuff\nhere \u2013 just entertainment. Evidently,\nproblems arise from the identity of\nthe next girl Masterson sees and so\ncomedy and song and dance numbers will of course follow.\nThis show should be good, and\nso far the reviews to emerge from\nthe previews stage have been very\npromising. Unfortunately, booking\ntickets looks like it can only be done\nin person or over the phone, as every\nwebsite I tried was less than helpful,\nto put it mildly. However, for general\nshow information the official show\nwebsite, www.guysanddollsthemusi-cal.com, is very good. It also looks\ngreat and has a lot of excerpts from\nthe score so you can have a taster of\nwhat you\u2019re going to see.\nPaola Smith\n\u2018Golden Era\u2019 musicals\nare back in town\nGuys and Dolls\nFrank Loesser\nPiccadilly Theatre\n16 Denman Street, W1\nBooking now open\nRoman mezzo-soprano\nCecilia Bartoli\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005\n4\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAnimal testing review published\nA landmark report on animal testing guidelines was released last week. Jenny Jopson looks at\nthe findings and asks: how close are we to seeing the end of what some call \u2018a necessary evil\u2019?\nIt is condemned as immoral,\nunnecessary and cruel by\nthose who oppose it, but for\nmany scientists, and indeed\nanyone who pops a headache\npill, the use of animals in\nresearch is a fact of life that\ncannot be easily dismissed.\nAnimal experimentation is regulated by strict\nHome Office guidelines,\nbut has not been formerly\nreviewed in almost 20 years.\nLast week\u2019s publication of a\nreport into the use of animals\nin research by the Nuffield\nCouncil on Bioethics sees the\nfirst review of the procedures\nand status of the debate\nsince the Animals (Scientific\nProcedures) Act of 1986.\nThe Ethics of Research\nInvolving Animals was produced by a Working Party of\nacademic and industry scien-tists, philosophers, members\nof animal protection groups,\nand a lawyer, over a period\nof two years. The diversity\nof professions and viewpoints\nwithin the working party\nreflects the fact that this\nissue is one that affects the\nwhole of society, and is not\nconfined purely to scientists\nand strident anti-vivisection-ists. The main focus of the\nreport is to introduce nuance\ninto a debate that has traditionally been very polarised\nwith respect to defenders and\nopponents, and to encourage\nwider public debate on an\nissue that effects us all.\nNick Ross, a member of the\nworking party, argues that\nthere is an inherent incompatibility in society\u2019s approach to\nthe issue of animal research:\n\u201cWhile we consider ourselves\nan animal-loving nation and\nwant to see less cruelty to\nanimals, we also want to live\nin a risk-free society where\nwe can use a new cosmetic,\nperfume or painkiller with\nconfidence.\u201d He argued that\nonly greater public engagement in the debate could\ntackle these difficult issues.\nThe report recommended\nfurther research into \u2018the\nthree Rs\u2019: refinement (a\ndecrease in the severity of\nprocedures), reduction (a\ndecrease in the number of\nanimals used) and replacement (the substitution of living animals with non-sentient\nmaterial such as tissue cultures or computer models). It\nalso suggested that scientific\npapers should include information as to how the three Rs\nhad been implemented.\nThe report also has significance for students of the biomedical sciences. Dr Lewis\nSmith, of Syngenta CTL, complains of the current shortage\nof graduates willing to work\nin the pharmaceutical industry due to the negative image\nof animal experiments. This\nresults in the loss to industry\nof many talented scientists,\nand necessitates more and\nmore recruitment from over-seas. Research conducted by\nthe Wellcome Trust in 2001\nfound that women are less\nwilling than men to undertake research involving animal experimentation, so further advances in replacement\ntechnologies could also help\nto decrease the gender gap.\nFrustratingly, the report in\nitself has no legislative power,\nand can only make recommendations of changes in pro-cedure. While a review of the\ncurrent situation was clearly\nlong overdue, and is to be\nwelcomed, further advances\nnow depend upon the actions\nof external funding bodies.\nAnd given the tight budgets of research institutions,\ndiverting funds from direct\nresearch in order to invest\nin replacement technologies\nmay present its own prob-lems.\nThe report hopes that,\nultimately, the need for live\nanimal experimentation can\nbe eliminated altogether.\nHowever, current replacement technologies still lag far\nbehind this ideal. We are not\nin a position to abolish the use\nof animals in research any\ntime soon, which is unlikely to\nplease the anti-vivisectionist\nlobby. Indeed, we may never\nbe able to replace animals\nentirely, but as is the case\nwith many things that may\nultimately elude us, there is\nno reason not to try.\n\u201cThis issue is one\nthat affects the whole\nof society and is not\nconfined purely to\nscientists and strident\nanti-vivisectionists\u201d\nThe Nuffield report emphasised the need to reduce animal suffering and find\nreplacement methods of testing that do not use animals\nThis week at the Dana Centre\nExpand your mind for FREE, right next to\nImperial College\u2019s South Ken campus.\nInquiries and bookings:\nTel: 020 7942 4040\nEmail: tickets@danacentre.org.uk\nThursday 2 June, 7pm\nHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Science\nCould The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy inspire future inventions?\nTuesday 7 June, 7pm\nHitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Space Tourism\nFeel like Arthur Dent.

He was a highly\nmotivated, competent and\npopular student, who always\nappeared to be very happy.\nHe will be missed by all those\nwho had the pleasure of\nknowing him.\u201d\nMr Srivannavit was an\nactive member of Imperial\nCollege Thai Society, which\nhas created a memorial web\npage where dozens of people\nhave already paid tribute to\nhim.

He then went on to\nbecome one of the world\u2019s\nmost successful high technology investors. He founded the money management\nfirm Amerindo Investment\nAdvisors, which currently\nmanages some $8bn.\nMr Tanaka, of Kingston,\nSurrey, is perhaps best known\nin Britain for his involvement in horse racing. He has\nowned several group one win-ners, such as Rakti. American\nauthorities suspect that he\nmay have used investors\u2019\nmoney to buy at least three\nthoroughbred racehorses,\nincluding Don Incauto, Agata\nand Fruhlingssturm.\nProfessor David Norburn\nof Imperial College described\nMr Tanaka as \u201cone of the\nmost exceptional entrepreneurs of our time, which\nmakes him the ideal role\nmodel for many hundreds of\nImperial students.\u201d\nMr Tanaka\u2019s \u00a327m gift is\nthe largest private donation\nin the College's history.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005 17\nHouse of Wax is the first of this\nsummer\u2019s big budget horror offerings and is a return to the \u2018teen\nslasher\u2019 genre that saturated our\nscreens in the late nineties.\nThe plot: a group of students venture unwisely into the woods, trying\nto get to a football game, where they\ndiscover a creepy little town whose\nresidents are either encased in wax\nor members of the murderous family that has killed everyone else.\nCarly (Elisha Cuthbert) and\nher boyfriend Wade head up the\ngroup, which includes three other\nfriends and Carly\u2019s trouble-making\ntwin brother Nick (Chad Michael\nMurray). The gang of friends spend\nan largely uneventful night camping out in the woods. The tensions\nbetween Carly and Nick take cen-tre-stage as their sibling rivalry\nsurfaces; as does Nick\u2019s dislike of\nWade.\nIt is only the next afternoon that\nthings really take a turn for the\nworse for the friends, when they\ndiscover the town\u2019s star tourist\nattraction \u2013 Trudy\u2019s House of Wax.\nUnsurprisingly, what follows is lots\nof screaming, running and excess\ngore.\nFirst and foremost, this is a horror\nmovie. It follows a tried and trusted\nhorror movie formula which, whilst\nwell known, usually does deliver\nsatisfactory thrills and chills. As\nalways, someone has to survive and\nmost people have to die. It is still a\nmyth as to why most act with absolutely no common sense at all. No,\ndon\u2019t go into the creepy museum all\nby yourself. No, don\u2019t go wandering\naround the dangerous woods alone.\nThe main differences here are the\ncentral premise of using wax to\nencase live bodies (it\u2019s more than a\nlittle disturbing), as well as the fact\nthat the main protagonists are twin\nbrother and sister rather than some\nloved-up teen couple. The film also\nmisses out the mandatory opening\nscene massacre, instead fleshing\nout the history of the killers and the\nbeginnings of the wax obsession.\nHouse of Wax starts slowly, but\nit builds up a good atmosphere of\nimpending doom, and a couple of\nisolated incidents give a taste of\nwhat is to come. When the blood\nstarts flowing, it does so in increasingly shocking and spectacular\nways. There are some memorable\nscenes, which is not so bad considering that this is a horror movie.\nSome of the gorgeous young\nHollywood starlets do well enough\nto pull off their obligatory kicking\nand screaming roles. Cuthbert\ncomes across quite well as the\nheroine, and Chad Michael Murray\nis impressive as a sullen troubled\nguy who loses all selfishness and\nturns all hero-like as he tries to save\nhis twin sister. The supporting cast\nis adequate, with Jared Padalecki\nstanding out the most as hapless\nbut eager Wade.\nThis brings me to Paris Hilton\u2019s\nacting debut as Paige. While it is\ntrue that she is not a great actress\nand her delivery is fairly two-dimen-sional, she still manages an average performance even though her\ncharacter has to spend time being\nchased around in her underwear.\nOne of the highlights of this film is\nthe awesome soundtrack, which features great tracks from the Prodigy,\nMarilyn Manson and Deftones.\nAnother is the theatrical ending,\nwhich is big and bloody and well\nworth waiting for.\nI did like this film, which is based\non the 1953 film of the same title, as\nit has all the ingredients needed for\nthe classic horror movie. This also\nmakes it a little bit predictable in\nparts, but the unexpected goriness\nmore that makes up for this. So\nHouse of Wax is an easy horror film\nfilled with lots of Hollywood babes,\npsychotic killers and more wax than\nyou\u2019ve ever seen before or are likely\nto ever see again.

Originally troubled\nwith casting problems, after Nicole\nKidman pulled out and Brad Pitt\nalmost left the project as he could\nonly see himself working with\nAngelina Jolie or Catherine Zeta\nJones, Mr & Mrs Smith should now\nflourish.\nMr & Mrs Smith promises to be\na comedy-thriller, starring Pitt and\nJolie as John and Jane Smith \u2013 an\nordinary suburban couple with an\nordinary,lifelesssuburbanmarriage.\nBut each of them has a secret: they\nare legendary assassins working for\ncompeting organisations. When the\ntruth comes out, John and Jane end\nup in each other\u2019s cross-hairs as\nthey are hired to kill each other.\nIf you think it sounds familiar,\nthat\u2019s because it probably is \u2013 I\ncan\u2019t help but remember the James\nCameron movie True Lies with\nArnold Schwartzenegger and Jamie\nLee Curtis. Arnold played a spy but\nlied about his job to his wife, played\nby Jamie.\nCan someone in Hollywood have a\nsemi-original thought please? They\nkeep trying to recycle the same old\nideas because they worked in the\npast. Most recent remakes have\nbeen terrible but I guess what\u2019s\nessentially different about this is\nthat both husband and wife are keeping secrets in this film as opposed to\njust the husband \u2013 what a groundbreaking concept.\nI\u2019m being a little unfair \u2013 yes, the\nstory isn\u2019t that original, but the trailer for the film shows potential. It\npromises to be full of action but also\nincludes funny moments in which\nthe pair almost destroy their house\nwhilst attempting to kill each other.\nPerhaps some marriage counselling\nmaybe needed.\nPitt and Jolie have an amazing\nchemistry on screen. Don\u2019t forget\nthis is the film that reportedly caused\nthe rift in Brad and Jen\u2019s marriage\n\u2013 it maybe worth checking out just\nto see if the Hollywood rumour mill\nwas right or not. Although that\u2019s not\nwhy I\u2019m looking forward to it.\nIt does boast an A list cast. Even if\nyou don\u2019t like Pitt or Jolie, they are\nfairly reasonable actors and are also\njoined by Adam Brody, also known\nas Seth from The OC.\nMr & Mrs Smith just seems like\none of those movies that, no matter\nhow unbelievable or stupid it may\nget, it will still be entertaining and\ngreat way to pass your time without\nhaving to think too much. It looks\nsexy, funny and action packed.\nHaj Attahir\nMr & Mrs Smith\nDirector: Doug Liman\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie,\nAdam Brody\nRunning time: TBC\nCertificate: TBC\nReleased: 10 June\nPitt-ed against each other: Brad and Angelina\n\n"

The Dow Jones Euro\nStoxx 50 Index rose 26.2 to\n3086.1, and the Dow Jones\nStoxx 50 Index rose 15.6 to\n2927.0.\nThe German DAX 30 Index\nrose 1.1%, or 47.06, to 4436.60\nand the French CAC 40 Index\nrose 37.01 to 4137.28. The UK\nFTSE 100 index rose 23.4 to\n4994.9.\nThe Dow Jones Stoxx 50\nrose 0.5%, with oil companies such as Total among top\ngainers as light sweet crude-oil contracts traded at $51\na barrel. Mining stocks like\nBHP Billiton also advanced\nstrongly.\nThe euro was weaker, down\n0.7% at $1.2512, as US gross\ndomestic product data for the\nfirst quarter was revised to\nshow a 3.5% rise.\nBarclays closed down 4%\nafter saying it now expects\nbad debt for 2005 to be somewhat higher than its last published risk tendency.\nThe bank said a slowdown\nacross the UK consumer\ncredit sector resulted in a\nrise in potential credit risk\nloans and a resulting increase\nin impairment losses. The\nincrease in delinquencies\nwas most noticeable in credit\ncards, the company said.\nThe warning hit other\nUK banks, with Royal Bank\nof Scotland down 3.2% and\nLloyds TSB falling 1.7%.\nContinuing the weak\nUK consumer theme was\nhome improvement retailer\nKingfisher, which said first\nquarter sales rose 2.2%\nto \u00a31.94bn (\u20ac2.82bn), but\ndropped 5.6% on a comparable basis, as early Easter and\npoor spring weather affected\nthe main consumer businesses in the UK and France.\nKingfisher shares rose 1.8%.\nCEO Gerry Murphy said\non a conference call that\nKingfisher isn\u2019t in takeover\ntalks. \u201cWe have no plans to\nbreak up this business and\nare not in discussions with\nanybody about anything like\nthat. I don\u2019t you think you\nmake life-changing decisions\non the back of a few weeks\u2019\ndifficult trading,\u201d he said.\nCurrent UK conditions are\nexpected to continue for some\ntime, he added.\nChina\u2019s Latest IPOs\nDuring the next six weeks,\nfour big Chinese companies\nare going to hit global investors with more than $8bn\n(\u20ac6.36bn) in new-stock sales,\nincluding the year\u2019s biggest\ninitial public offering (IPO), at\na time when IPOs around the\nworld have performed dismally and as trading volumes\nacross Asia have dried up.\nEven with China\u2019s economy\ncruising along at a growth\nrate of 9.5%, fund managers\nsay, these companies -- two\nbanks, a coal company and a\nshipping concern -- may have\nto price their stock cheaply to\ndraw investors stung by this\nyear\u2019s raft of sinking IPOs.\nThat means cheap valuations\nand interesting opportunities,\nthey say.\nCompanies will have to\n\u201cscale back their expectations and climb down from\ntheir high horse,\u201d says Bratin\nSanyal, head of Asian equities for ING Investment\nManagement. \u201cAppetite for\nAsian equities at this stage is\nless than before.\u201d\nThe daily average value\nof shares traded on Hong\nKong\u2019s stock exchange this\nmonth is down 27% from the\nfirst quarter, amid concerns\nover a global economic slow-down, rising interest rates\nand currency volatility. Equity\nissuance by Asian companies,\nexcluding those in Japan, is\ndown 20% so far this year\nfrom a year earlier, according to market-data provider\nDealogic.\nThree-quarters of the 28\nnew listings in Singapore\nthis year have fallen below\ntheir offer price. The latest,\nBiosensors International\nGroup, which was listed on\nMay 20, saw its shares sink\n39% on its first day of trading\nafter being priced near the\nbottom end of an indicative\nrange.\nThe trend spans the globe.\nEarlier this month, Boise\nCascade in the US yanked\nits $400 million offering, failing to find a suitable price\neven after lowering the offer\nrange. High-profile stock\noffers by Lazard and Warner\nMusic Group in the US have\nboth fallen below their offering price.\nInvestment bankers say\neach of the four big Chinese\ncompanies coming to market\nwill be different enough from\nthe pack to attract investors,\nand that there are enough\ninvestors sitting on cash,\nwaiting for the right oppor-tunity, to absorb this flood of\nstock. Indeed, these offerings\nhave long been in the works,\nand that in itself can generate\nexcitement among investors.\nFurthermore, IPOs in Hong\nKong haven\u2019t fared so badly\nthis year, with eight of the 12\nnew stocks above offer price,\nthough the number of new\nissues is half what it was a\nyear earlier.\nStill, the quartet of issuers\nhave their work cut out for\nthem in this environment.\nEven a banker involved in one\nof the four offerings acknowledged that \u201cin terms of [the\nbillions of dollars of] equity\nyou see coming to the market\nin the next six weeks, it looks\nvery challenging.\u201d\nHolding back for richer\ntimes isn\u2019t an option for China,\nwhich churns out multibillion-dollar IPOs of state-owned\nenterprises every year. That is\nin part because Chinese companies have limited options\nfor raising cash. Banks have\ncut back on lending, and the\ncountry\u2019s domestic stock markets are among the world\u2019s\nworst-performing, each down\nabout 17% this year. Two of\nthe companies set to list soon,\nChina Shenhua Energy and\nBank of Communications,\nhad planned to raise money\non the domestic markets but\ndropped the idea because of\nthe market\u2019s poor perform-ance.\nThe biggest new listing out\nof China so far this year is\nShanghai Electric Group,\nwhich raised $648m in April.\nIts shares fell on the first day\nof trading and have since\nedged back up around their\noffer price.\nThe final company coming to market is China Cosco\nHoldings, which last week\nreceived approval from the\nHong Kong stock exchange to\ngo ahead with its initial stock\nsale valued at between $1.5\nbn and $2bn. The shipping\ncompany will begin sounding\nout investors today.\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\nwhat you are going to see\nis the pricing is going to be\nvery realistic,\u201d says Flavia\nCheong, a fund manager at\nAberdeen Asset Management\nin Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s worth taking a look.\u201d\nChina\u2019s booming economy is set to get even stronger following six major initial public offerings\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005\n8\nColumns felix@ic.ac.uk\nExams are like pieces of string.\nEach piece of string is holding you\nup, high above the real world. The\nmore strings there are, the less\npressure there is on each one.\nEach time you sit an exam, a string\nbreaks, bringing you closer to freedom down below. Once the final\nstring snaps, away you go. Whether\nyou land on your head or on your\nfeet depends on the way the strings\nbreak.\nTaking the analogy a little further,\nsome may say too far, some strings\ncould be elastic, so that just when\nyou think you are free and away, you\nbounce back and have to do resits.\nBy the time you read this, my final\nstring will have broken and I shall\nbe free and falling through the nine\ncircles of project hell.\nStrings can be used in so many\nanalogies. Life is like a piece of\nstring, floating in the wind.\nSometimes turbulently, sometimes\ncalmly. Sometimes two pieces of\nstring can become tangled together,\neither briefly, or knotted forever.\nRelationships are like string, tying\nyou down, impinging upon your freedom to go drinking with your mates\nor have sex with many, many beautiful women. But also, like string, they\ncan be a source of strength. Two\nobjects tied together are stronger\nthan one.\nAs I sit here nursing a hangover\nand thinking about string, my mind\ndrifts to the three questions posed\nlast week by Miss Woods. What is\nmy definition of a slut? What about\npromiscuous males? What is your\nworld when you are asleep or under\nanaesthetic?\nMy definition of a slut is, coinci-dently, the same as the OED\u2019s definition of a slut. Great minds think\nalike eh? \u201cA woman characterised\nby many transient sexual relationships.\u201d In case I caused offence to\nthe undefiled Stormy, it should be\nnoted that I only said she sounds\nlike a slut, and that I was not casting\njudgment, since to do so would be to\ninvite judgment to be cast upon me.\nSecondly, promiscuous males do\nnot, as far as I am aware, get their\nown word. So I will invent one and\nhope it catches on: \u2018snut\u2019. I don\u2019t\nknow very many snuts. I\u2019m not particularly enthusiastic about the idea.\nThat\u2019s about all I think of it. People\ncan do whatever the hell they like\njust as long as it doesn\u2019t bug me.\nAnd finally, I\u2019ve never been under\nanaesthetic, but when I am asleep\nmy world becomes filled with chocolate boxes and roses. Fields of daf-fodils. Shooting stars flying through\nthe Milky Way. A world of happiness\nand natural beauty.\nYou see, relationships aren\u2019t\nabout sex. Sex to relationships is\nlike cream to strawberries. Just the\nright amount can be nice, too much\nis sickly, and strawberries are damn\nnice with none at all (drinking cream\non the other hand...).\nDo you know what the human\nbody goes through when you have\nsex? Pupils dilate, arteries constrict,\ncore temperature rises, heart races,\nblood pressure skyrockets, respiration becomes rapid and shallow,\nthe brain fires bursts of electrical\nimpulse from nowhere to nowhere,\nand secretions spit out of every\ngland. And the muscles tense and\nspasm like you\u2019re lifting three times\nyour body weight. It\u2019s violent, it\u2019s\nugly and it\u2019s messy.\nSex is like a superstring. Tiny\nobjects vibrating at various frequencies with different amplitudes give\nrise to a veritable zoo of particles\nand life forms. And if we can figure\nout how to link superstrings to a\ntheory of attraction, we will have\nsolved one of the greatest mysteries\nof the universe.\nIn the meantime, remember some\nwise words from CS Lewis: \u201cMortal\nlovers must not try to remain at the\nfirst step; for lasting passion is the\ndream of a harlot and from it we\nwake in despair.\u201d\nString theory\nby AARON S\nSo now you know I don\u2019t know any-thing, read on.\nI stand by my right to ask questions\nwithout needing validity through the\npromise of any answers. However,\nanswers are another part of the\nwhole process of our short experience in this consciousness. Asking\n\u201cwhy?\u201d (though obviously many of\nmy questions do utilise the rest of\nthe magic \u2018w\u2019 words) is just a continual effort and a journey to repair\nthe blind subservience I have given\ninto at some points in my life. The\nsyndrome, I have witnessed time\nand time again, of enslaving oneself\nto the first experience, or first book,\nor first philosophy that fell off the\nshelf and hit us on the head. Asking\nis good, it gives people the opportunity to answer.\nI went to a really interesting talk\nlast year with a priest, a rabbi and\nan imam. Yes I had questions and\nindeed the rabbi was lovely and\nreally respected what I was trying to ask. Unlike how some may\nsee my presence, my questioning is\nwith all ears and mind open for the\nanswers. After asking some questions about hell (strictly speaking I\ntend to always be heading towards\nthat elusive place, especially according those jolly guys preaching in\nOxford street every time I go shoe\nshopping), he said something very\ntrue. Someone cannot be an atheist\nwhile still looking. Does that mean\n\u201cbeing\u201d anything means we are\nclosing ourselves off from discover-ing? I cannot \u201cbe\u201d an atheist if I am\nstill asking.\nA point of information, I am\nnot an atheist in the conventional\nsense. I think the imam was just\ntrying to reassure me about hell\nand that I certainly still have hope.\nMy view is far more optimistic, I\nalways have hope. I am thinking\ncryogenics.\nThen there are those places\nwhere questions are welcomed but\nshrouded with sinister animosity. I\nwas at \u2018discovery of Islam\u2019 week and\nbefore I knew it someone decided to\napologise to me for the bad feeling\narousing from my enquiries. I was\noblivious to becoming unpopular\nand gladly so. Someone even suggested that my being there was just\nfor the sake of asking something\n\u2013 obviously they just didn\u2019t understand the intellectual content of the\nqueries posed.\nWhat was actually interesting\nto observe was the night that the\nChristian society came and posed\ntheir questions. It was almost amusing to see the steam seething from\nboth sides like a modern day ToryLabour fight in the commons \u2013 so\nmuch bickering over ultimately the\nsame underlying philosophy!\nHey, look\u2026 I know the differences\nin the detail (the devil loves lying\nthere) but surely it is the same\nGod. What was really striking is\nhow the majority of the onlookers\nwere far more able to engage in the\ndebate between the Christian holy\ntrinity and Islamic interpretation\nof it, than my delving enquiries.\nProbably because my challenges\nappealed to the part of the mind\nthat had died that day the book fell\noff the shelf.\nThe answers I have faced so far\nhave had many forms. There are\nthose that are \u201crational\u201d who love to\nback up their arguments either with\nphilosophical science they dreamt\nup in their sleep, or statistics they\ngrew in their back garden. Then of\ncourse there are the \u201cirrational\u201d,\nwhere the irrationality of the argument itself tends to be an argument\nfor it. The passionate \u201cthis is the\ntruth because I have found it and I\nknow it is true because I feel it in my\nheart. Oh, and this book says so,\u201d is\nalways a good one.\nIt is great listening to everything\nand maybe sometimes it is predictable and a whole lot of bother. So why\ndo I persist? Because sometimes I\ndiscover little gems and it delights\nme. When I do ask, I am always prepared for my humble intelligence to\nbe taken as a sign of easy prey and\nbefore long I discover everybody has\nthe answers, except me!\nThe answers\nby SUMA BHATTACHARYA\nBig Brother to blame for teen\npregnancy\nWorthy government agencies are,\nthis week, blaming reality TV\nshows such as Big Brother for the\nrise in teenage pregnancies. The\nUK currently holds the undesirable\ntitle of teen pregnancy capital of\nEurope.\nThe Brook Advisory centre stated\nthis week that the intense media\ninterest as to whether any of the\nvacuous contestants have got\njiggy is to blame for teenage preg-nancy.\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we be interested\nin the sexual antics of Big Brother\nor Love Island contestants? Well,\nfor a start, its hardly intellectual\nthought-provoking telly is it?\nPerhaps we should be spending\nour time engaged in more fulfilling activity, like reading Ulysses.\nPerhaps. But there are times when\nyou just want to mong out in front\nof some mindless telly, the main\nvirtue of which is the very fact that\nyou don\u2019t have to concentrate on\nit. We are programmed to be interested in sex, so it would be a little\nworrying if we suddenly lost interest \u2013 the population is decreasing\nas it is.\nI believe it is too simplistic and,\nperhaps, even contradictory to\nblame Big Brother and other reality\nTV for teen pregnancies. The UK\nhas twice as many teenage mothers\nthan France and Germany where\nsex is omnipresent on TV screens,\nto the extent that shampoo adverts\nshow more heaving bosoms than\nhair.\nIn my opinion the perceived wisdom that talking about and exposing\nchildren to sex encourages them to\nengage in sexual congress is in fact\nthe reverse of what actually occurs\nin practice. We have six times more\nsprog-producing teens than the liberal Dutch. When things are secretive or hidden they become much\nmore intriguing and generate inter-est, and this isn\u2019t just the case with\nsex.\nSex education is notoriously bad\nin schools. It might have improved\nsomewhat now, but I didn\u2019t get my\nfirst sex ed class until year nine. I\u2019m\nfrom the south so it was probably\njust in time, but it is still woefully\nlate.\nThis warning comes at a time of\nreignited public debate in the wake\nof the revelation that three sisters\nin Derby all gave birth by the time\nthey were 16. Is it remotely conceivable to blame Big Brother or\nCelebrity Love Island for this baby\nfactory? The mother of the girls\nblames schools and the government for providing inadequate sex\neducation, and she may have a point.\nBut, if you were the mother, after\nthe first girl gave birth, wouldn\u2019t\nyou sit her sisters down and spell\nit out?\nOne could be cynical, like some\nof the tabloids, and suspect that\ngirls with few prospects see becoming pregnant as the only alternative\nto a hand-to-mouth existence. The\nthree sisters are suspected to be\nreceiving more than \u00a3600 a week in\nbenefits.\nThe Neighbours generation\nby RUPERT NEATE\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 2 June 2005 7\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nLibrary crisis revisited\nDear Dave,\nI wholeheartedly endorse the comments of my anonymous colleague\n(\u2018Library crisis\u2019, Felix 19 May). But\nwhat an extraordinary reply from\nthe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, in the\nsame issue. That he \u2018reacts with a\nsmile\u2019 is offensive, sad\u2026 and typi-cal. That people (ie critics of what\ncurrently goes on the IC library\nworld) \u2018have to move with the times\u2019\nshows how little he knows of the\ncurrent situation. Has he actually\nvisited the central library through\nthe night to see what tiny fraction of\nthe student population is using it\u2026\nand how? Has he visited early in\nthe morning to see the mess, ranging from pizza boxes and towers of\nempty beer bottles to smelly socks\nand sleeping bags? Has he called in\nduring the day to see how many students can find neither table at which\nto work or chair to sit on due to the\namount of personal possessions left\nby camping students who have gone\nhome for a snooze but are treating\nthe central library like a hotel so\nthey can keep their own table for\nweeks on end? Yes, all this \u2018does\nmake the place a bit different\u2019; good\nof you to notice, sir. Good of you to\nacknowledge, too, that \u2018WE have to\ndeal with that at the moment\u2019. Why\nwas there absolutely no anticipation of the likely problems by management this year after the similar\nmess of 2004?\nAnd into this scenario it is aimed\nto decant yet more departmental\nlibraries. Add to this the fact that\nthe number of IC students increases\neach year, and that IC aims to move\nits humanities department into level\n5 thereby reducing current library\nspace. \u2018We have to consolidate as\nmany of the departmental libraries\nas possible\u2019 says the rector because\nsuch moves are \u2018in the best interests\nof students \u2026 That\u2019s what students\nwant\u2019. Few students avail themselves of 24/7 opening but render\nthe central library unpleasant at\nbest and unusable at worst for the\nmajority. So, \u2018in their best interests\u2019,\nSir Richard? I think not.\nOne wonders, when one hears that\n24/7 was the most requested change\nto library services from students,\njust how many actually called for\nit. Surely they had a right to expect\nthere would be proper planning for\nit. Could it be that the rector has\nseen 24/7 opening at ivy league colleges in the US where, firstly, students show so much respect for their\n\u2018alma mater\u2019; secondly, they are all\nvery clear about rights and respon-sibilities; thirdly, security staff have\nvery clear rules which they have an\nabsolute right to enforce; fourthly,\nmanagement not only give every\nsupport to security staff to implement best practice, they actually\nstick their collective heads above\nthe parapet for once and show some\nsigns of knowing how the library is\nbeing so abused, and show some\ngenuine concern.\nWith departmental libraries in the\ncentral library, with more students,\nand with 24/7 opening, next year\npromises to be worse \u2013 much worse.\nBy which time Sir Richard will be\noff, and staff and future students will\njust have to live with it, won\u2019t they?\nAnother central library librarian\nDear Editor,\nI would like to follow up all the recent\narticles about the libraries and the\nstate of the service. Clare Jenkins,\nthe Director of Library Services,\ninvited all the student reps to an\ninformal meeting this evening to\ndiscuss the problems experienced\nover this year. It was an incredibly\nuseful discussion if only to highlight\nthe fact that students had something worthwhile to say and that\nthey were also willing to listen to\nother side of the story.\nThe Mech Eng library closure has\nbeen well publicised and strongly\nfought. Clare was happy to divulge\nthe 10 year plan of the library which\nwould infact mean that closure of\nall departmental libraries within\nthe next ten years. She also wants\nto make sure that everyone knows\nthat this is the plan instead of the\nshock tactics used by Mech Eng to\nmake the inevitable hurt more. She\nwas also keen to prove to us that\nshe was acutely aware of the need\nfor study space and adequate study\nconditions. The discussion touched\non the ventilation and heating in\nthe central library, the litter and\nsmell during the 24/7 hour season,\nthe noise and the recent problem of\ndesk hogging. The ICSM Rep also\nadded that the opening hours at\nCharing Cross were not adequate\nfor 4th years onwards who spend\nall summer studying for exams,\nand opening times during holidays,\nespecially Christmas time.\nIt was a well attended meeting\nshowing that the students obviously\ncare about their library service. We\nknow this is true from all the articles in Felix recently about various aspects of the library. However\nstudents need to be made aware\nthat they must feedback to the\nlibrary how they feel so things can\nbe changed. Opening hours surveys\nare being conducted at the moment\nand there are plans to get undergraduate representation on a regular committee meeting. And did you\nknow that if you cannot find your\ncore textbook there is a link to tell\nthem directly? (www.imperial.ac.uk/\nlibrary and go to contacts, feedback\nlink.) This means that Clare then\nhas the vital student voice in pushing what WE want to have and not\nletting decisions obliviously go on\naround us or problems unnoticed.\nHelen Dawson\nMech Eng Dep Rep\nAn alternative to fees\nDave,\nIn your last comment piece, you\nsaid that Top-Up Fees campaigners\nshould have put forward alternative\nfunding strategies. We did!\nI remember one exceedingly\nlong Union Council meeting in\n2002 where Etienne Pollard, along\nwith the rest of the Top-Up Fees\nWorking Group, did exactly that!\nIn fact Union Council eventually\nplumped for the alternative funding\nmodel of restructuring higher education and removing the target of\n50% of young people going into HE,\nalongside creating more vocational\ncourse places. This model had been\ncosted by us and public opinion had\nbeen sought.\nIt wasn\u2019t just us that were putting\nforward this model though; the\nGovernment\u2019s own white paper on\nHE funding discussed this model\nand indicated that it was a less\nfinancially onerous option for the\nindividual and society. Despite all\nthe evidence available in support\nof this model, the Government still\nwent ahead with Top-Up Fees.\nIt\u2019s all very well having an alterna-tive, but if the powers that be don\u2019t\nwant to listen then they won\u2019t.\nYours,\nKatherine McGinn\nICU Top-Up Fees Working Group\n2002-3\nDeputy President (Education &\nWelfare) 2003-4\nDave Edwards, Editor, replies:\nI did not mean to criticise\nImperial\u2019s response to the introduction of top-up fees; rather my comments were aimed at protesters\nnationally, such as the NUS, who I\nfelt had sent a strong \u201cno to fees\u201d\nmessage without giving the same\nemphasis to whatever alternatives\nthey favoured.\nRebranding the Rector\nSir,\nMy proposal is to harmonise the\nsenior management structure of the\nCollege with the \u2018clear and uncomplicated\u2019 rebranding exercise instigated by the Rector in 2003. The\nnext phase of rebranding would target other aspects of the college from\na \u2018bygone age\u2019 \u2013 such as Sir Richard\nhimself.\n\u201cI think it would be a good move\nforward\u201dsaidAugustusPlantagenetBolingbrooke, one advocate of the\nnew phase of rebranding. \u201cIf you\nwere to look at a page with the\nRector\u2019s name on it you would see a\nnice modern \u2018Dick, Rector\u2019 without\nhaving to read all this other stuff\nabout \u2018Sir Richard Sykes DSc FRS,\nRector of Imperial College\u2019.\u201d\nThe rebranding would mean that\nSir Richard, after receiving his\nKnighthood in the 1994 New Year\u2019s\nHonours list, would not use any of his\ntitles in the majority of publications.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t mean that we would discard Sir Richard\u2019s Knighthood, or\nhis Fellowship of the Royal Society,\nhis Honorary Fellowship of the Royal\nSociety of Chemistry, Fellowship of\nthe Academy of Medical Sciences,\nFellowship of Imperial College of\nMedicine, Fleming Fellowship of\nLincoln College, Oxford; nor his\nHonorary Doctorate in Pharmacy\nfrom the University of Madrid;\nhis Honorary Doctor of Science\ndegrees from the universities of\nBrunel, Cranfield, Imperial, Bristol,\nEdinburgh, Hertfordshire, Hull,\nHuddersfield, Leeds, Leicester,\nNewcastle, Sheffield, Strathclyde,\nWarwick or Westminster, they would\njust be used for special occasions.\u201d\nIt is noted that Sir Richard worked\nincredibly hard to obtain doctorates\nfrom all these universities, partly\nby employing scientific methods in\nthe business world. For example,\nas chairman of the remuneration\ncommittee at Rio Tinto in April 2003,\nhe used a very scientific method in\nthe calculation of the 22% increase\n(from \u00a346,000 to \u00a356,000) in remuneration of Rio Tinto non-executive\ndirectors, including himself. The\nalgorithm used was undoubtedly\nvery advanced, since the adjusted\nshare price of Rio Tinto fell some 7%\nin the previous year of 2002.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t actually done a survey of the Rector, or the students,\nbut I think it would be an interesting concept, if Dick turned out to be\nunbelievably conservative himself\nand rejected the proposals...\u201d said\nAugustus.\nHighlights of the proposals:\n\u2022 Sir Richard Sykes would henceforth be referred to as \u2018Dick, Rector\u2019\nor simply \u2018Dick\u2019, use of the abbreviation \u2018Sir D\u2019 should be discouraged.\n\u2022 A new website would be created,\ncalled \u2018e-Rector\u2019, to help the college\nunderstand the new guidelines for\nrebranding.\n\u2022 The new phase of rebranding concept will be paid for by \u2018Dick\u2019 in the\nsame way that the college paid for\nitself to be rebranded by an incredibly expensive image consultancy\nfirm.\nName and department supplied\nLetters to the Editor\nBy the techforum team\nEver been in a situation where you\nneed specific technical advice in an\narea outside your field of expertise?\nEver wondered what research goes\non in various departments across\ncollege?
