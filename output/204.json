    "content": "FELIX CARNIVAL DISAPPOINTS\n\"I blame the printer !\" said Chairman Hodgson on being asked\nwhy Carnival receipts were coming in much slower than in previous\nyears. He was referring to the poor sales of the new style Carnival\nMagazine, \" Old Rope,\" which together wit li the raffle, produce the\nvast majority of the Carnival income. \" He was meant to have the\ncopies ready over one week earlier than he did, as a consequence\nsales have been affected and valuable publicity within the magazine\nhas been lost.\" The magazine itself had plenty of sales appeal, an\neffect created by an excellent cover, high quality paper and good\nlayout. Despite the weakness of much of the material, the maga eine is undoubtedly a much better reflection on the College than previous\nefforts.\"\n\u00a3d. \u2014We understand from the printer that 4,000 copies were\ncollected between Monday and Friday preceding the Carnival week\nand the remaining 3,000 copies were awaiting collection until Tuesday\nof Carnival week.\nWhile the money is counted\n(above), Humphrey Lvttleton\nplays on at the Carnival Hop.\nm CARNIVAL TIMING\nIt appears that the total effect\nof Carnival has now reached satu-ration. How much of this is due\nto its timing\u2014so close to Undergraduate examinations?\nSupport for College functions is\nnormally difficult to muster, but\none can more readily understand\nthe difficulty of attracting Carnival personnel when exams are so\nnear at hand. Coupled with this,\nthe Carnival Committee has to\nendure two terms of what is comparative inactivity, often at the\nexpense of holding other positions, then it becomes evident that\nCarnival date leaves very much\nto be desired.\nUniversities such as Manchester\nand Liverpool favour the end of\nthe Winter term, Leeds (after\nexams) at the end of the Summer\nterm and Sheffield have theirs\nsoon after the commencement of\nthe Autumn term. All of these\ndates involve some compromise,\nbut it seems that I.C. has chosen\na particularly bad one.\nCould not the timing of I.C. Carnival be carefully recon-side red? CARNIVAL\nINTERNATIONAL EVENING\nA superb evening enlivened with colour, exotic food, a casino,\ndancing to a Caribbean steel band and a cabaret with performers\nfrom many countries. All the performers appeared completely free\nof charge and the smoothness of the perform ar^e was commendable\nconsidering there had been no rehearsal.\nMENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS\nFirst away in Carnival Week was an Orchestral Concert produced by the I.C. Music Society, at which most of the audience were\nmental patients invited to the College by the organisers. Full marks\nfor this charitable act which also created much goodwill with Mental\nHealth officials. The musical vein was continued by a Sunday evening Concert performance of Mozart's Don Giovanni, ostensibly provided free of charge by performers from the Covent Garden Opera\nCompany. Much to the disappointment of the organisers, expenses\nclaimed by the performers were sufficient to absorb nearly all the\nreceipts from an almost packed house.\nTHE CARNIVAL PROCESSION Whole families come out to watch . . .\nPOOR PUBLICITY\nCarnival has still not succeeded in fully impressing itself on the\npeople of South Kensington. Bad publicity must take most of the\nblame. Internal notification of events was very mediocre (certainly\nincapable of competing against Yogiads !). Gone were the stickers\nwhich covered all of South Kensington last year.\nPeople cannot attend what they do not know about. One year\nthe Carnival Organisers will realise that heavy expenditure on publicity is justified. M_ HOSKER.\nTHAT JUKE BOX! Many said \" What are I.C. students coming to!\" Others were\nseen to cover their ears as they\nentered the Snack Bar. But the\nfact remains that Snack Bar business went up by over 10% for the\nperiod that the Carnival Juke\nBox remained there. Add to this\nthe facts that it was played almost\ncontinually, that the evening the\nmachine spent in the Union\nLounge resulted in the place losing\nits familiar deserted look and\nthat many students were heard to\nsay hopefully, \"Is it to-be here for\ngood?\" And the arguments for\npermanent canned music in l.C. mount up.\nl.C. Union is sparsely used. A major cause of this is the lack of\na comfortable focal centre. An intimate coffee bar, of the Soho\nvariety, with music, somewhere in\nthe Union, could well fulfill this\nneed. With such a centre, perhaps members of this Union\nwould start trickling back.\nTry giving it a thought Council]\nOthers were less impressed\nPublished by FELIX BOARD, Imperial College, London, S.W.7.

This, he\ncontended to be the worst possible example which could be\ncited\u2014chosen, presumably, to be\ndeliberately distant. However, to\nput things in perspective, he explained that houses are very much\ncheaper, and after all, a roof over\none's head is the thing in life\nwhich people want more than\nanything else. Cars are not unduly\nexpensive. Petrol is certainly\nmuch cheaper\u2014and so it goes on.\nTo continue the argument,\nstarting salaries were quoted.

It was argued\nthat since Britain has very little\nto offer to the world in the way of\nraw materials, then why not encourage the mass production of\nScientists for use abroad. After\nall, British industry doesn't seem\nto know what to do with its en-g in e ers, and we really do seem to\nhave more than enough (despite\nRobbins and others). The Gaelic\noutburst with which we began is\nreasonable evidence of this. However, the brain drain allows for a two way traffic, so there is no\nreason why we should come out\nlosers\u2014or is there?\n4-Hour Day\nOne member of staff who was\nquestioned had some views on i he state of British industry. He\nclaimed that it is under capitalised, and that the output, per man, is\nvery low. He agreed that there\nare not enough jobs available for\nthose being trained. The threat of\nnationalisation frightened others\nwho were questioned. Has British\nindustry anything to offer at all?\n\u2014\" Sure\u2014a nice relaxed way of\nlife.

It\ncan operate both as a computer\nin its own right and as a means of\npreparing input for the 7090 in\nthe form of magnetic tape (read-ing cards at up to 800 per minute),\nand similarly converting the 7090\nmagnetic tape output into printed\nmatter (printing up to 600 lines a minute) or punched cards.\na reflection on his status in Society.\nMention the word engineer\nand one immediately conjures\nup the image of a gro tty little man\nin gro tty overalls, digging a hole\nin the road.

Some have said to\nme that the v have already visited other European countries and in\na way they felt these wer\ne more or less old hat to them, and they would\nlike to spend a vacation in Bulgaria, but needed more information.\nIn this short article I will try to do this.\nBulgaria is a small country in the, Balkan Peninsular, whose\nfertile plains and fields look like colourful carpets and whose snow-capped mountain peaks and sun-drenched beaches are washed by the\nblue, warm waves of the Black Sea. A beautiful country impregnated with the aroma of rose gardens, blessed with an abundance of\ngrapes and other fruits and vegetables, of tobacco, herbs and fi owes. If I may sum ur> the impressions of many a western tourist: a mild\nMediterranean climate, low humidity, beautiful blue skies and rain-less summers make Bulgaria a natural holiday paradise.\nI have been many times asked\nabout special Bulgarian drinks\nand dishes. Of course it is im-Hospitality is traditional with\nBulgarian people and is considered an outstanding Bulgarian\nfeature which manifests itself in\neveryday life. The people like,\nwhen returning home from work,\nto \u201e welcome guests. Bulgarian\nfolk songs and stories describe\ncountless gatherings round the\ntable over a flask of brandy or\nwine.\nMany villages still preserve\nthe custom of special days of the\nyear when all doors are open to\nvisitors and it is considered a special honour to welcome those\nof other villages or more distant\nparts. Young girls receive the\nguests with joyful songs, and their\nhosts invite them to the most\nprominent places at the table.\nJokes, laughter and songs accompany the entertainment.\npossible to describe all of the rich\nvariety but here are some hints to\nbear in mind. Try rose liqueur\nmade from the petals of the famous Bulgarian roses, Slivovitza\n(plum brandy) which is the national drink, Mastika (an aniseed\ndrink) and different kinds of white\nand red wines. Never leave\nBulgaria without tasting such\ndishes as: Yoghurt\u2014best in the\nworld and really so, Tarator\u2014\nyoghurt soup: beaten up yoghurt\nwith chunks of ice, pieces of cu-c umber, sprinkled with chopped\nwalnut and other spice, Kebabcheta\u2014meat prepared after an old\nBulgarian recipe, grilled on char-coal, Giuvetch\u2014ave get i ble Bulgarian hot-pot Bulgaiian style\nNow to the point where some\npractical hints could be useful.\nFirst 1 should like to say that\nvisas are no problem what s over and may be obtained in 24 hours\nat the Bulgarian Embassy in London (12, Queen's Gate Gardens,\nS.W.7). One pound is equivalent in Bulgarian currency to 5.60\nlev a. In other words for one\npound you will receive the\nequivalent of 34 shillings. At the\nInternational Youth Camp you\nhave to pay daily about 17 shillings for full board.\nIf you go on your own to Bulgaria it is useful to know the address of the Bureau for International Youth tourism \u2014 10,\nKaloyan Street, Sofia. There it is\npossible to arrange for a stay at\nthe Youth Camp or elsewhere.\nIn London you can do this\nthrough Balkantourist, 45, South\nMolton Street, Mayfair, W. l, or\nEnglish and Overseas Tours Ltd.,\n169, Regent Street, W. l.

Hussell, 56, Weeks Hall.\nLILLIPUTI\nUN\nU.N.I. C. CAMBRIDGE\nOn first sight these three names seem to have very little in com-mon. However, on the last Thursday of the Spring Term when many\nwere already getting into the holiday spirit, 17 IC students (including\n4 ICWArians) travelled down to Cambridge in order to attend the\n1st Model Assembly of the United Nations. The conference was\nsponsored by the Sunday Times and it was the first of its kind held\nin England.\nAs the name implies the assembly was to work on similar lines\nto that in New York except that each country was represented by\nstudents. IC provided the delegations for Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Siam. The aim of the assembly was to interest\nstudents jn the working of the United Nations and the countries which\nthey represented. Furthermore, the conference gave us an excellent\nopportunity to meet students from other universities in the U.K. The Assembly was formally opened by the Mavor of Cambridge\non Friday and it was subsequently presided over by Frederick Boland,\na former president of the U.N. General Assembly.\nThe first debate which was on g ation( although he opposed her\nthe \" World Situation \" revealed\nthat many of the Afro-Asian\ncountries were strongly in favour\nof the admission to the U.N. of\nRed China instead of Nationalist\nChina. The Cambodian delegation was no exception as could be\nheard when Andrew Wilson delivered his exciting speech calling\nfor the recognition of Communist\nChina and the withdrawal of\nAmerican influence in South East\nAsia. When the Nationalist\nChinese delegate wanted to address the assembly, almost half of\nthe 100 present delegations left\nthe hall in protest. However, the\nhall in protest. However, the\nChinese speaker was extremely\neloquent and most delegates could\nbe found listening to the loud\nspeaker transmission.\nThe second day was spent debating the situation in South\nAfrica and a permanent UN Force. The African delegates\nfelt very strongly about this subject and wanted to impose severe\neconomic sanctions against the\nRepublic. However, due to the\nskillful coloured Fiji law student\nwho led the South African de le attitude personally) and the influence of the Western countries\nonly moderate sanctions such ns\nan embargo on military goods\nand petroleum were called for.\nThe conference ended on Sunday with a debate on \" Development\" which concerned the emerging countries. Most countries\ncalled for increased trade and improved prices for primary products but very little was said\nabout education. The Afghan\ndelegation could pass a resolution\nasking for more educational facilities in the richer countries, but no\nagreement could be reached about\neducational and technical aid.\nWe all left Cambridge with a feeling of achievement and of\ncourse it was comforting to know\nthat IC provided most delegations\nof all the universities in the U.K. except for Oxford and Cambridge\nwhich organized the assembly.\nThe assembly was very successful and the standard of debating\nvery high. The \"Sunday Times\"\nis now considering having another\nassembly next year, probably in\nLondon and possibly at I.C....A. MEISEN\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX EDITORIAL DEAD OR DYING? This Union is dying. Like a worm cut in two it continues to\nthrash sporadically, but if the present rate of slow strangulation is\nallowed to continue it cannot last long. The societies which help\nmake it, still thrive (although some, like the Debating Society,\nthreaten to pass to greener fields) but the real idea of a Student's Union, is floundering in a huge bog of bureaucracy.\nLast term's Union meetings showed a flicker of life and one\nhoped that people were really interested in the proposed constitutional\nchanges. A cynical few maintained that the crowds had gathered to\nsee heads roll in the Felix motion from the President; their view\nwas perhaps justified when the last meeting of the term remained\nin qu or at and had to be abandoned.\nBehind every venture or society there is always a leader, someone of stature, personality and initiative. In a body in the nature\ncf a Student's Union, a leader is a first essential ; from this source\nmust come the image and inspiration of the Union. Our Union has\nno image\u2014in the constituent Colleges mascots, elite drinking clubs\nand sheer sport provide an inescapable image. You may not like\nit but it remains a focal point for the activities of that Union. Think\nof Guilds and one thinks of Bo and a Spanner, possibly beer ; think\nof Imperial and one is lost. A select few would hope that \"The\nPhoenix \" is the rallying point of the Union, but fortunately they\nremain select and few. Others perhaps look to the bars, and others\nto l he societies. Few would claim that the Union has one focal point\nespecially since Southside has shown the Union building up for what\nit is : ugly, dated, and usually uncomfortable.\nROOM AT THE TOP\nThis image should without question come from the ton. Colcutt last term talked of the ideal President, a mixture of administrator\nand sportsman, a thinker and drinker. Our last three Presidents have\nbeen a businessman, a volatile idealist and an expert administrator ;\nnone however have really provided the Union with any kind of\ninspiration.\nWhat the College must find for itself very rapidly is a President\nwho can throw the sort of image that \"Kitch\" did six years ago. and\nis still remembered. The post of Deputy President ma v ease the situation somewhat, but until we find someone who will instill respect\nand be capable either of silencing his critics or ignoring them, the\nUnion will continue to flounder.\nDECENTRALISATION\nHow can this trend away from personality and toward bureaucratic administration be stemmed ? While Council continues to elect\nits President then the same pattern will folio\" in a regenerative process which regurgitates the members of its clique one after the other.\nMany of the most eligible and capable of students will not even\nconsider the job. Supervisors will often not accept a President on\npost graduate courses because of the enormous amount of time that\nthe job consumes. The President himself sits on a very large number\nof purely administrative committees which may last up to six hours\nor more. The wastage of time is phenomenal, and it may be true\nthat this sort of work favours a certain type.\nIt appears that the task of President could be considerably\nreduced if some of this committee resp on sibi l ty could be delegated.\nAfter all, the art of leadership is the art of load shedding and the\nmanipulation thereof. Not only would the duties of the President\nbe lessened, but many other able persons at College would have an\nopportunity to gain invaluable experience.\nUntil some sort of decentralisation is engineered, it seems\nunlikely that many will relish the job of President, and until a President capable of producing an image appears, the Union must continue to suffer.\nCHEMISTRY EXPLOSION\nImperial Institute Road was\nshaken last week by an explosion\nwhich rocked the Chemistry\nBuilding and shattered several\nsquare feet of the glass roof. Dr.\nDavid King was making measurements of the sticking probability\nof nitrogen on metallic films at\nlow temperatures when his apparatus exploded, and he was\nbadly lacerated about the head\nand shoulders by flying glass.\nCondition Satisfactory\nDr. King's present condition is\nreported to be satisfactory, and\nit is now known that his eyes have\nnot suffered any permanent damage as was at first feared.\nAlso injured by the blast was\nDr. King's wife, who received extensive cuts and burns on one\nleg, and less severely, Miss S.B. Kulkarni, Ph.D., who was working some distance away on a different project.\nThe accident was attributed to\nan accidental breach of the normal safety precautions on the part\nof Dr. King.\nCHALLENGE REFUSED ?\nA gauntlet thrown down before\nthis college at the beginning of\nthe year has been tardily taken\nup.\ni 'he influx of residential students into the immediate confines\nof Imperial College appears to\nhave presented problems rather\nthan opportunities. The Union\nhas made but few overtures to the\nSouthside residents and waits impotently for the first cries of its\nnew born. Of the new halls some\nhave not enough energy even to\nmourn their birth and only one\nhas raised its corporate head to\nherald its own presence.\nIn previous years Beit hall\nsupported those students who saw\nit fit to run the Union. They eked\nout their elaborate lives by a series of intrigues which still\nsprout like weeds along those\nhallowed Halls. The introduction\nof Week's hall like an invisible\nfinger in a grey dawn foretold\nof a rosy dawn if not a golden future for residents of this college.\nLeadership\nIn an analysis of activities in\nSouthside this year we find that\nleadership was the element most\nobviously lacking. The Union as\na whole seemed unable and in\nsome cases unwilling to instil\nleadership into the spirals that are\nSouthside. A little inertia can be\nexpected from such a large and\ndiverse body of people as council.\nImpetus should have come from\nthe top.\nWith leadership Tizard has\noutstripped the other halls in\ncombining a sense of unity and\nindependence with a sense of\npurpose. In this year they have\nsucceeded in getting their hall\nrecognized outside the normal\nrange of this college. The other\nSouthside constituents appear to\nbe pallid and distorted reflections\nof a Beit-Weeks Hall.\nToward a Functional Hall\nFrom the attitudes of the war-dens, be they right or wrong, the\npattern set can be clearly defined.\nThree wardens feel that movements towards a functional type\nof hall should come directly from\nthe students. The fourth warden\nhas recognized in students not\nonly the a fore mentioned inertia\nbut also the inability of the majority to visualise a new concept\nof communal living.\nIn this year Dr. Cameron has\nnot only attempted to open the\neyes of the men in Tizard to an\nideal but has succeeded in showing its practical possibilities. The\nstudents of Imperial college of the\nfirst and second generation need\nto be introduced and allowed to\nmix with people in varied experiences beyond the realm of their\nown. Tizard have had this pri vele ge in functions varying from\nmulled wine parties in the company of local dian it aries. to the\nindividual entertaining of public\nschool science masters. This\nlatter function is more fully reported in the Engineer, 30 March.\nInformal talks and discussions\nduring a regular Thursday evening\nbuttery hour or in students rooms\nduring other times, have revolved\naround such people as Air Vice\nMarshal Sir Arthur Longmore,\nEditor of Vogue and House and\nGarden, the Bishops of Maidstone and Stepney, Sir Patrick\nRiley (an Ambassador to Moscow\nand now working for UNESCO),\nto name but a few. The formation of a diners club as well as\nFolk Music, Hi-Fi and Brass rubbing groups shows that an atmosphere conducive to living is en-joyed.\nTizard and the Goldsmiths\nPerhaps the biggest success is\nthe alliance between Tizard Hall\nand the Goldsmiths of London,\nresulting in an invitation to din-ner, with the possibility of further,\nstronger, and more advantageous\nbonds in this great Livery Company.\nThe future is seen warily\nthrough skeins of mist. The\nUnion may well revolve around the\nSouthside residency, with its own\nstructure of sport and social activity on an independant basis.\nA residents' league of the major\nsports, the teams made up of\nstudents attached to halls as well\nas living in them, with a supreme\nI.C. team at the head of each\nsport. It is hoped that whoever is\nin power next year will realise the\ninevitability of this sort of system\nand support it for the welfare of\nstudents instead of lighting it and\nhiding from the future like an\nostrich with its head in the sand.\nThe Editor wishes to extend his\nthanks to N.J. Walker and all\nthose who helped in producing\nthe FELIX Carnival Supplement,\nat a time when he was incapacitated by examinations.\n\n"

And now\nperhaps you have a difficult choice to make.\nAsk yourself this key question: which company is most strongly linked to the pattern of\neconomic growth ?\nTurner & Newall is one of the strongest, most important\u2014though least publicised\u2014groups in\nBritish industry. And with a large and growing stake in asbestos-cement, in insulation, in\nbrake linings and in plastics T&N is closely linked to all four major areas of economic growth.\nTo the building industry; the motor industry; the newer plastics; and to activity in the underdeveloped territories of the Commonwealth.\nT&N thus offers outstanding graduates a career of great scope, keyed from the start to the\nareas in which expansion is at its fastest... opportunity at its best. Remember too that under\nT&N' s broad and flexible training scheme, the graduate assumes managerial responsibility\nmore confidently\u2014and certainly earlier\u2014than is often the case in industry today.\nNote to Research Men T&N also recruit scientists and engineers direct into its\nresearch branches, whose projects are particularly closely linked to the needs of the\nexpanding industries. Group spending on research is rising every year.\nIf you are not already in touch, ask your Appointments Board for further details or write\ndirect to:\nManagement Appointments Adviser,\nTURNER & NEWALL LTD \u2022 15 CURZON STREET \u2022 LONDON Wl\nTURNER & NEWALL LIMITED\nTURNERS AS BE S rcS CEMENT CO.

In\nthis respect it was an improvement on last year's effort, when\nthe first race was run with an inch\nof water on the track. In actual\nathletic content, however, it didn't really compare.\nTrue, there were some exciting\nfinishes, notably in the mile relay\nand the hurdles, but the stars of\nlast year were seriously missed.\nR.C.S. won the Governors'\nTrophy by 162 points to 142 from\nC&G again.

GROUP\nVAC-RAMBLING\nLuxembourg Frolic\nIn the North of the Duchv, the\ndeep forested valleys of the\nArdennes gave good walking,\nwhile in the east, the caverns,\ngorges and cliffs of the \" Petite\nSuisse \" region seem to belong to\na lost world.\nThe hostels varied from primitive to modern, but one of the\nmost interesting was the feudal\ncastle at Hollenfels. The people\nwe met were industrious and\nfriendly; one evening the girls in\nour party found themselves serenaded by a lad of forty with a harmonica. The appearance of\nhis irate wife, near closing time,\ncaused the .locals great amuse-ment. We returned via Koblenz\nwhere a visit to the Deinhard wine\ncellars, nearly three centuries old,\nmade a pleasant climax.\nScottish Porridge\nOn Easter Sunday, another\nparty were heading over rough\nScottish roads, via Loch Laggan\nto Ratagan. After climbing the\nSisters of Klentail, the sea was\ncrossed to Skye and Glenbrittle\nhostel. The warden here migrates\nsouth in Winter to play Santa\nClaus at a large London store.\nSeveral days were spent enjoying magnificent weather walking\nand scrambling in the bu ill in s. While there, an interesting job\ninvolved carting four hundred tins\nof stewed steak for the warden\u2014\nnot all Scotsmen appear to live\non porridge! The party returned\nby Fort William and Ben Cruachan finishing with a480 mile\ndash to London.\nOn the first weekend of term,\nsome people once more attempted\nthe Lyke Wake Walk^ O miles\nover the highest and broadest\nparts of the North York Moors.\nBalls come and Balls go. Some\nare good and some not too good.\nThis year's May Ball was one of\nthe better ones. Evidence of lavish preparations abounded every-where. More people, more\nflowers, more decorations, more\nbands and more cabarets than any\nother Ball on the I.C. Calendar.\nThe May Ball also sees the\nchoosing of the Carnival Queen\nSome were confirmed addicts;\nothers new to the cult. Starting\njust after 3.00 a.m.( and in poor\nweather) six of the ten starters\nfinished in under eighteen hours.\nNow recovered, they claim to\nhave enjoyed it. Later on this\nterm, we are hoping to attempt\nthe South Wales Marathon. Wish\nus luck !\nand four pretty girls assembled in\nthe early hours of the morning to\nbe judged. Congratulations to\nLyn Curtis, the winner, who only\nhours before the start of the Ball,\nhad been lon a ju'm ping for the\nvictorious I. C.W. A. athletics\nteam. Its good to see an\nI.C. W.Ar ian winning any w \u00bby! Points to Criticise. The bars\nwere very short of the right drinks,\nthe cabaret was unusually dull\nand the lower dancing floor was\nlargely unusable because of unsuitable bands.\nPoints to commend. The excellent value for money one received and the superbly conceived\ndecor.\nThought for the future\u2014why\nnot try having a May Ball over at\nSouth Side?\nQuote: from a lady at the above,\nbitterly,\n\" I only saw a few flowers, and\nHodgson's feet were in those.\"\n\n"
