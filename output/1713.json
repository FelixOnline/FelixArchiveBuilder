    "content": "Imperial Sailing invades Warwick and takes on the\nTurtle\nImperial Sailing brings half of the club to the sailing competition in Draycote Water, beats the strong winds,\nsurvives capsizes and effortlessly wins the social.\nSPORTS\nMarta Nunes De\nAbreu\nICSC Secretary\nAnita Plumley\nICSC member\nT\nhe weekend\nstarted earlier for\nsome members of\nImperial Sailing,\nas they left the lecture\ntheatres, packed up their\nsailing bags and drove up\nto Warwick on the Friday\nnight. The specially appointed driver (Toby) was\ntrusted with towing two\nof the club\u2019s boats that\nWarwick Sailing Club\nhad borrowed, and which\nwould later use the mast\nof one of them.\nWhilst the group\npartied all of Friday\nnight and socialised with\nother uni sailors, the rest\nof us were aiming to get\nan non-optimal amount\nof sleep before the 6am\ndrive on Saturday. In the\nmorning, the departure\nwas inevitably delayed\ndue to a late fresher,\nMarta, who still doesn\u2019t\nknow how to use an alarm\nclock.\nStill, the sun was\nstarting to come out and,\nwith plenty of sailing\nfreshers to spare, we\ndecided to let our sleepy\nfresher make her own way\nto Leamington Spa (the\nclosest train station she\ncould find to the sailing\nclub).\nWith a minibus packed\nand another car filled to\nthe brim, we made a start\nat 7am and managed to\nhave all of 25+ sailing\nmembers in Draycote\nWater for a 9.30am\nbriefing.\nOn arrival, the expected\nstrong winds, low temperatures and snow were\nthankfully not apparent\nright away. Ignoring the\npromise of stronger winds\nthroughout the day, the\nboats were rigged with full\nsails instead of cut-downs.\nOur teams Imperial Blue,\nWhite and Red launched\nto start racing right away.\nShout out to Dan\u2019s team\nspirit (Third Team crew)\nfor immediately after finishing his race, jumping\ninto the car and picking\nup his sleepy teammate\nfrom the train station.\nApparently, driving with\nsailing kit doesn\u2019t affect\nyour driving skills.\nThe races started\nslowly and in spite of\ntemperamental winds\nand confusingly marked\nlocations, our teams were\n\u201cin spite of the\never-changing\nwinds and\nconfusingly\nmarked\nlocations, our\nteams were\ngetting on\nwell\u201d\ngetting on well. As the\nwind built up towards the\nend of the morning, the\nrain started and so did the\ncapsizes from our fourth\nteam \u2013 Imperial Kobra\nHurricane. The team\nproved itself to be more\nthan nine social sailors, as\nthey attentively listened\nto their coach \u2013 James\nMcLeod (Development\nOfficer) on how to become\nunbeatable. However,\nthe advice did not prove\nvery useful, as one of the\nfreshers managed to sail\ndown the opposite end\nof the lake and missed\nthe start of the race by 4\nminutes, getting the club\u2019s\nfirst DNS (Did Not Start)\non a competition event.\nThe racing came to\nan end by mid-afternoon\nwhen sunlight was too\nlow to carry on sailing.\nOur club was feeling\noptimistic about our\nperformance. Overall\nImperial Blue and White\n(first and second team)\nwere both tied in 1st with\n100% wins, and Imperial\nRed (third team) showed\ngood improvement during\nthe day, getting 2 wins in\ntotal.\nIt was finally time to\nget off the wet sailing kit\nand dress up for the curry\nsocial. As per tradition the\nsocial at The Turtle, there\nwas copious amounts of\nEliminator prepared for\nall the sailors. This is\nthe famously alcoholic\ncocktail prepared by\nWarwick students, the\nWholesome squad photo. // IC Sailing\nISSUE 1713\nFELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n30\nSailing the high seas. // UWSC\nrecipe of which is closely\nguarded. Upon hearing\nthe news that this year the\nteams would be allocated\nwith a certain number\nof bottles, our members\nsoon started to devise a\nplan to get a hold of the\nhighest quantity of bottles\npossible.\nEliminator really lived\nup to its name, causing\nsome sailors\u00b4 memories of\nthe night to be foggier than\nothers, accounts of the\noccurrences vary slightly.\nAll that is certain is that\nall of the Imperial sailors\nmade it to the curry, and\nmost of us then went on to\nKelseys (a nearby club).\nThere, we procured more\nEliminator, played pool\nand slowly split up into\ngroups to make our way\nback to our host\u00b4s house.\nThe accommodation\nprovided seemed too\nscarce for our 4 teams and\na half, leaving members\nto get creative on how\nto get a good nights of\nsleep \u2013 we hear someone\nmanaged to sleep in the\nbed of one of the hosts,\nand someone else booked\nan Airbnb, conveniently\nclose to Kelseys.\nSunday morning came\ntoo soon for many of us,\nalong with incredibly\nstrong winds. Because of\nthis, races were initially\npostponed and, after Felix\ntried to test sailing conditions and almost capsized,\nwere ultimately cancelled.\nThis came as a welcome\nannouncement to the\nmany hungover sailors.\nBoats were speedily\npacked up and we all\nbundled into our cars\nand minibuses, happy to\nfinally be out of the wind.\nEveryone arrived home\nsafely and, went straight\nto bed.\nMany thanks to University of Warwick Sailing\nClub for organising the\nevent. Special thanks to\nthe designated club drivers\nfor getting everyone\n(and our two fireflys) to\nWarwick. Lastly, thanks\nto Rooster Sailing for\nproviding us with sailing\nkit during the year!\n\n"

    "content": "Good Dog: Tales of Dignity in the Cauldron of Poverty\nPoverty has a drowning\neffect. Those who are\neconomically oppressed\nwill often find themselves\nberated for paddling in an\noverly ferocious manner\nas they struggle for\nbreath. Whilst the media\nand large swathes of politicians have failed to give\nvoice to these suffocating\ncommunities, many\nartists are standing up to\ngive insightful, honest\nand humane responses.\nArinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s Good Dog\nis a striking example of\nthis. Here at the Watford\nPalace theatre, Kwaku\nMills channels Kene\u2019s\nwords to give a dignified\nand compassionate insight\ninto the daily struggles\naffecting far too many\npeople in modern day\nBritain.\nDelivered as a mono-logue, interspersed with\nnoughties grime and\ngarage, the play begins\nwith Mills as an innocent\nschool boy who worships\n\u201cgood\u201d fervently. His\nsteadfast and dutiful\nresponses to the daily\nchallenges of his family\u2019s\npoverty are naive to the\npoint where one is immediately aware trouble\nwill come. Along with\nhis own struggles, Mills\u2019s\nall seeing eye peers from\nhis balcony to bring us\nstories of a variety of\ncharacters from his estate.\nThe local corner shop\nduo of \u201cGandhi\u201d and his\nstray cat are particularly\ngreat. Each is judged in\nturn, being cast initially\nby the naive child as good\nor bad. Although many\nof the good characters\nare currently struggling,\nwe are reassured that\nit is merely a matter of\ntime before their fortunes\nchange. Unsurprisingly\nthis doesn\u2019t prove to be\nthe case.\nLife begins to wear not\nRather than leaving him\nin a continued state of\nhaplessness, his decisions\nare a clawing attempt for\ndignity made by a child\nunder immense pressure.\nThe ability of Mills, who\nis excellent throughout,\nto translate this reasoning\nfor a range of different\ncharacters as he narrates\ntheir lives is astounding.\nStage centre for the play\u2019s\nentirety is a charred\nmonolithic cube. Swirls\nof smoke slowly billow\nfrom its carcass-like\nframe, evoking memories\nof Grenfell.\nA statue to the kind of\ninevitable and depressing\nend game that often\nmeets Mill\u2019s ensemble of\ndowntrodden neighbours.\nThis air of inevitability\nthat the play is soaked\nin adds an uneasiness to\nyour viewing. Here it is\nthe London Riots that\nwill be the play\u2019s climax.\nThe intelligence of Kene\nis to present this political\ntragedy as a human one.\nWe see anger as dignity\nand structural oppression\nas daily struggle. There is\nno sense of politics being\nplayed, just life as it is\nexperienced. This, along\nwith the interesting range\nof characters makes for\nessential viewing.\nWitness for the Prosecution\nW\nho doesn\u2019t\nremember\nreadingAgatha\nChristie\u2019s\nbooks as a child? Murder\nmysteries, full of suspense\nand intrigue, invariably\nwith an unexpected twist\nor surprising revelation\nin the d\u00e9nouement. The enduring popularity of Agatha\nChristie has seen a plethora\nof film, stage and West End\nadaptations of her stories,\nsuch as Kenneth Branagh\u2019s\nrelatively recent Murder on\nthe Orient Express.\nWitness for the Prosecution was adapted for the\nstage by Christie herself\nfrom her short story,\nTraitor Hands. As the title\nsuggests, the courtroom\ndrama, a small part of the\noriginal story, becomes\nthe focus of the play. And\nwhere better to set an\nexciting courtroom drama\nthan an actual courthouse?\nLucy Bailey\u2019s production is set in the spectacular Council Chamber of\nthe old London County\nHall \u2013 and boy, do she\nand designer William\nDudley make use of the\ngrandiose surroundings!\nFrom the moment you\nstep in, the austere marble\narchitecture and sweeping\nstaircases immediately\nconjure the solemn atmosphere of a courthouse.\nThe impression only\nintensifies on entering\nthe Chamber itself \u2013 a\nsoaring domed ceiling,\nLady Justice on the wall,\nand concentric rows of red\nleather seats, each with its\nown tiny wooden desk,\nlooking down upon the\nsmall stage area.\nYou feel like you\u2019re\nactually in court, watching\nthings happen in real time.\nDiscreet, brass-covered\nspeakers are dotted\nbetween the seats at\near-level, imperceptibly\ngenerating the ambient\nmurmurs of the court-room. This is quite clever\non the part of Dudley and\nsound designer Mic Pool.\nNot only does it overcome\nthe acoustic challenges of\nthe vaulted ceiling, but\nwhen particular events\nhappen on stage, the\nshocked gasps that fill the\nroom seem to come from\nthe audience itself. The\nillusion of being \u2018in court\u2019\nis very real \u2013 the witnesses are even called from\noutside the chamber, and\nmake their way through\nthe audience to the stand.\nThe trial we\u2019re attending is that of the young\nLeonard Vole (Daniel\nSolbe), accused of murdering a rich old lady\nof his acquaintance for\nher money. Sir Wilfrid\nRoberts (Jasper Britton),\nconvinced of his inno-cence, must fight his old\nrival Myers (William\nChubb) in court to save\nhim from the noose. But\nwith all the evidence\nagainst Vole, it looks to\nbe a losing battle. And\nthere\u2019s Vole\u2019s enigmatic\nforeign wife, Romaine\n(Emma Rigby)\u2026\nIt\u2019s a suitably melodra-matic, if somewhat clich\u00e9,\nplot. At least up until the\nlast fifteen minutes of the\nplay, when everything is\nupended in not one, but\ntwo dramatic twists! It is\nan Agatha Christie plot\nafter all. Without giving\ntoo much away, it definitely comes as a surprise and\nleads the play to its thrilling conclusion. If I have\none complaint, it\u2019s that\nthe twists are almost too\nout-of-the-blue. Unlike\nthe best mystery novels\nwhere you can guess who\nthe killer is, we\u2019re almost\ncompletely in the dark\nuntil the big reveal.\nSolbe is utterly convincing as Leonard Vole\n\u2013 you\u2019d never believe the\nhonest-faced young lad\ncapable of murder. Or\nwould you? Opposite him,\nRigby makes a captivating\nRomaine \u2013 seductive, sly\nand ever so foreign with\nher thick German accent.\nAnd Britton looks like\nhe was plucked from the\nQueen\u2019s Bench Division\nto play Sir Wilfrid\nRobarts, with Chubb\u2019s\ndogmatic and slightly\nprissy Myers serving\nas his foil. Though she\ndoesn\u2019t spend much time\non stage, Phoebe Marshall\nalso deserves a special\nmention for her delightfully vapid portrayal of\nSir Wilfrid\u2019s secretary\nGreta.\nWitness for the Prosecution is definitely a\nnight to remember. It\u2019s\nnot exactly subtle or\nsoul-searching with its\ntrope-heavy plot and\nstereotypical characters,\nbut then again it\u2019s never\npromised to be anything\nelse. With its spectacular\nsetting and dramatic plot,\nit\u2019s entertainment anyone\nwill enjoy, regardless\nof whether they prefer\nNietzsche or Netflix.\nISSUE 1713\nFELIX\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

This is where\nKene\u2019s subtle writing\nshines. The young Mills\nslowly becomes \u2018bad\u2019, the\nreason for the quotes being\nthe play\u2019s underlying\npoint: one has a sense of\nrespect or understanding\nfor the boy\u2019s decisions.\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 8TH\nFEBRUARY, 2019 FELIX\n13\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCounting Sheep: Join the Revolution!\nM\nark and\nM a r i c h k a\nM a r c z y k ,\nc r e a t o r s\nand writers of Counting\nSheep, met and fell in\nlove in the barricades\nin Maidan Square while\nfighting for life and free-dom. The show is directed\nby Natalia Kaliada and\nNicolai Khalezin, political refugees due to their\nillegal theatre company,\nthe Belarus Free Theatre,\nin a country where all\ntheatre must be state-sanc-tioned. From this unique\nartistic collaboration\narises a powerful political\nargument for democracy,\nhuman rights and peace,\nwithout ever falling into\nthe trap of self-pity. The\nevents in the play are\nbased on historical facts\nand the personal stories of\nMark and Marichka, who\nalso perform (though not\nas themselves), notably\nthe wall, as Protesters,\nfrom where we are invited\nto join the fight; or around\nthe table, also as Protesters, but with premium\nolution and witnesses of\npolice brutality, burning\ndestruction and deadly\nsniper shots. We also meet\nMarichka, a classical\npianist who was due to\nhave the most important\nconcerts of her life the\nday the revolution broke\nout. The gigs were can-celled, and she joined the\nfight. With her, and thanks\nto Georgina Beaty\u2019s\nastonishingly bold perfor-mance, we feel the urge to\ncare for the wounded, the\ndespair at being unable to\nhelp, and the anguish of\nnot knowing if the ones\nwe love are safe.\nThere is an interesting\nphenomenon of collective compliance to the\nincreasingly complex\ntasks we, as an audience,\nare asked to perform. We\ndon\u2019t really understand\nhow we went from being\ncomfortably seated to\njoining in the rhythmic\nsection of an electrifying\nsong, cheering as a couple\nof strangers gets married,\nplaying musical chairs,\nholding shields and\nhelmets among sandbags,\nbricks and toppled tables,\nhelping strangers to clean\nthe barricades in the\naftermath of bloodshed\nand taking part, horrified,\nin funeral ceremonies.\nThe transition is subtle\nand never forced, but the\nfact remains that an initially reluctant audience\n(including myself!) ended\nup as central players in the\nshow. The adequate tone\nis achieved during the\nwhole performance, now\njoyful and overflowing\nwith tradition and national\npride, now respectful and\nmournful for the hundreds\nof lost lives, now resilient\nand confident in the rebuilding of the country.\nFrom a technical\nperspective, we couldn\u2019t\nwish for anything more.\nSmartphones are encouraged and brilliantly used\nin the show, together with\ncontinuous projections\nof real footage from the\nuprising that bring realism\nand a larger dimension to\nthe show. Lights, sound\neffects and choreograph-ical stunts are all creatively employed to build\na complete theatrical\nexperience. The sets are\ncompletely transformed\nbefore our eyes, so fast\nthat we barely notice.\nHowever, what truly takes\nthe show to the next level\nis the music, brought\nto us by the Marczyk\ncouple\u2019s Balaklava Blues\nproject. Influenced by\ntrance and electro-pop\nbut with an ethnic touch,\nthis mix of recordings,\nlive performance and\nelectronic manipulation\nadd continuity and unity\nto the play.

With a passion. It\nhas fast become the bane\nof my existence, hence\nwhy I procrastinate and\nleave them to the last\nminute. Which is where\nwe are now, after a day\nof successful procras-tination, it is just past\n10pm and I'm writing\nthis wretched thing. Ask\nme to review a Kendrick\nLamar album and I'll\ngive you page upon page\nof in-depth analysis into\nthe inner workings of\nKing Kendrick's mind.\nAsk me to write an\nEditorial and I struggle\nto string together half a\npage. Anyway, we move.\nOn to serious business.\nFront page news this\nweek is the revalation that\nall students who signed\nup to Sport Imperial prior\nto the 1st\nSeptember price\nchange are now eligible\nto a full refund of the \u00a330\nfee. As someone that was\nparticularly disgruntled at\nthe price change, this is\na significant move on the\npart of Sport Imperial and\nthe Union to rectify their\nerror. Although I am still\nslightly annoyed that I am\nnot actually eligible for a\nrefund myself, I think it's\nimportant to acknowledge\nthat Sport Imperial has\nrealised its mistake and\nmoved quickly to rectify\nthe issue and come up\nwith a smooth remedy.\nThis is also significant\nbecause it represents a\nmajor change that was\nbrought about as a direct\nresult of the student voice.\nI'm particularly gassed\nbecause Henry Hart\ninitially accused Sport\nImperial of fraud through\nwriting a Felix article and\nthat article was effectively\nthe first 'domino to fall'. If\nanything, this is proof of\nthe impact students can\nhave to better their situation at Imperial if they\n2\ndecide to use their voice,\nbe it through writing Felix\narticle or by any other\nmeans. Finally, I wouldn't\nlet the disappointment surrounding the gym blunder\novershadow the fact that\nSport Imperial are making\nmajor moves to improve\nsport at Imperial, an issue\nthat has been present since\nI joined as an undergraduate in October 2014.\nTomorrow is the Felix\nAnnual Dinner, the most\nwholesome of wholesome\nevents. I was going to\nuse this editorial to write\nthe speech I'll say at the\ndinner but, as per usual,\nI'll end up imporivising\nthat on the fly tomorrow.\nInstead, I'll preview my\nspeech with some of the\ninitial ideas I've had so far.\nMuch like my approach\nto most things in life, I\nliken running Felix to\nmanaging my team, Manchester United. Fred was a\nlegend, much like SirAlex\nFerguson, and left behind\na title-winning squad (the\nFelix fam). In my tenure,\nI think I've embodied all\nof the managers that have\ncome in since Fergie's\nretirement. I began my\ntenure just as hapless as\nDavid Moyes, moved on\nto being as ineffective\nas Louis Van Gaal and\nI've flattered to deceive,\nlike Jose Mourinho.\nNow I think I'm having a\nresurgence, much like Ole\nGunnar Solskjaer, and the\nFelix fam is performing\nlike title winners. I also\nwant to take this chance\nto congratulate Music\nEditor, Simran Kukran,\non securing her PhD\nplacement. A big win for\nthe team! Without Simran\nconvincing me to write\nfor Felix in my third year,\nand then convincing me to\nrun for editor last year, I\nwouldn't even be involved\nin Felix.\nFinally, section of the\nweek goes to Books!\nIndira has written an exceptional review, so well\nwritten that she should\nprobably have my job.\nprior to the price change.\nThe sum of the refundable gym fees amounts\nto over \u00a3100,000 and the\ndecision to offer students\na refund was taken in\nDecember 2018. The\nrefunds are expected to\nbe processed within five\nambition to improve sport\nfor all at the College\u201d and\ncomes amidst a slew of\npositive changes to sport\nat Imperial. \u201cAt \u00a330, we\nstill wanted to make sure\nthat it was affordable, accessible and appropriate,\u201d\ncommented Mr. Hollyer.\nWith all funds generated being directly\nreinvested in facility and\nservice developments,\nimprovements, such as the\nfull replacement of gym\nequipment and refurbishment of Ethos, Charing\nCross and Hammersmith\ngyms, have occurred and\nplans are underway for the\nexpansion of Ethos gym\n(thanks to the President\u2019s\nfund). Sport Imperial have\nalso announced plans to\nintroduce an app which\nwill include activity tracking and a reward scheme\ndesigned to encourage\nphysical activity, whilst\nalso improving functionality for Ethos bookings.\nMr. Hollyer added:\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is it\nto be the defining issue of\nworking days.\nJames Medler, the\nDeputy President (Clubs\n& Societies) told Felix:\n\u201cThis is a really big step\nin the fact that the student\nvoice has been really listened to and that\u2019s going\nto result in probably a few\nthousand students getting\ntheir money back.\u201d\nThis error in changing\nthe membership was\nmade \u201cwith the earnest\nthe strategy when we\u2019ve\ngot loads of really exciting stuff. We\u2019re just about\nto change effectively the\nWill Mondays forever be meatless?\nJ\nanuary has come\nand gone, along\nwith the trial of\nMeat Free Monday. So what\u2019s next?\nWill Meat Free Monday\nbecome a permanent\nscheme on campus?\nMeat Free Monday\n(MFM) was a student\ncampaign created from\na combination of ideas\nthat came from different\nundergraduate socie-ties, PhD students, and\nMasters student groups,\nwith the help of many\nvolunteers, Greening Imperial, College Catering\nand the Union. With huge\nsupport from College and\nthe Union, over 35 outlets\nacross four campuses took\npart, including all College\nand Union outlets, as\nwell as Pieminister and\nSilwood catering!\nThroughout the month,\na wide range of events and\nstalls were put on, highlighting all the different\nreasons you should eat\nmeat one less day a week.\nWhile the main aim of\nthe campaign was to\nreduce our environmental\nimpact; there are also\nhealth benefits to reducing\nyour meat consumption,\nexplained on our stall\nby Dr Cullimore, and\nfinancial benefits if you\ncontinued MFM at home,\nas meat is more expensive\nthan grains and veg.\nOthers interpreted it as a\nfun challenge, and some\ntook it one step further by\ngiving #veganuary a go.\nMeanwhile, the Animal\nProtection & Education\nSociety (APES) highlighted the animal welfare\nbenefits by using virtual\nreality demonstrations,\nprovided by the Animal\nEquality charity.\nOverall, the campaign\nwas a success at getting\nstudents to talk about the\nidea of MFM. There was\nbuzz online, chatter in\ncafes, and articles written\nby you in Felix! Knowing\nthere would be a split in\nstudent opinions, MFM\nwas always advertised\nas a trial, with the final\ndecision to continue or\nnot to continue being\nleft up to you! You voted\nin the Instagram polls,\nyou filled out the online\nsurvey, and you told us\nyour comments.\nSo what was the de-cision? Will Meat Free\nMonday become a permanent campaign?\nWith 523 people taking\npart in the survey (69.9%\nof which stated they\nwere meat eaters), 57.7%\nof you wished for it to\ncontinue, while 40.0%\ndid not and the remainder\nwere impartial. However,\nthe Instagram polls of 200\nvoters swung the other\nway, with 53.9% wishing\nfor it not to continue. With\nno clear winner, it was\nhard to decide whether\nto turn the Meat Free\nMonday trial into a permanent campaign or not.\nWhat did stand out in the\nsurvey, was the demand\nfor more information\nabout the environmental\nsustainability of the food\noptions, as 84.7% of\nstudents considered the\nimpact of their diet on\nthe environment. Furthermore, talking to students\nhighlighted concerns\nabout the lack of options\nregularly on campus for\nvegetarian and vegan\ndishes, as well as a lack of\nhealthy dishes that had a\nwide variety.\nWith all this informa-tion, the College Catering service and I have\ndecided not to continue\nMeat Free Monday, but\ninstead to shift the focus\nfor the remainder of the\nyear to providing a wider\nrange of healthier options\n(meat and plant based) on\ncampus! Some changes\nare already being made,\nsuch as the introduction\nof the new salad bar in the\nSenior Common Room\n(SCR).\nSo what do College\nCatering and I have in\nplan for you for the rest of\nthe year? Well, get ready\nfor some big changes!\nThink new, plant-based,\nsustainable caf\u00e9 - a place\nwhere you can relax while\nenjoying fresh, healthy,\nand, most importantly,\ndelicious meals. Opening\nin Summer term, inspiration for food options,\nnew service structures,\nand caf\u00e9 layouts is currently being gathered in\npreparation for this caf\u00e9,\nwith new dishes being\ntrialled in the other outlets\nto gain student feedback.\nIf you have a dish you\nlove/hate, then let College\nknow by filling out the\nexperience box on the\nfeedback form: imperial.\nac.uk/food-and-drink/\ncontact-us. Other ideas\nbeing debated include\nmoving the College Cafe\nhot sandwiches to the\nJCR, while also adding a\nsalad bar and a rotisserie\nchicken stand, introducing 24-hour vending\nmachines which contain\nmeals and snacks to help\nyou power through those\nlate night study sessions,\nor introducing a pizza and\npasta cafe on campus! I\u2019ll\nbe keeping you up-to-date\nregularly, with blog posts\nand updates on my Union\nwebpage about the exciting progressions!\nThe newly-refurbished Ethos gym // Sport Imperial\nwhole way that sport is\ndigested and consumed at\nuniversity with the Sports\nHub.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1713\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nSmash Corner-R.O.B- Nintendo\u2019s off-brand Johnny 5\nF\normally known\nas the Robotic\nOperating Buddy,\nhe is without a\ndoubt the most mysterious\nand unique character of\nthe roster, fighter #42,\nR.O.B.\nNever actually taking\npart in a game of his own,\nR.O.B. was designed as\na revolutionary gaming\ncompanion for the original\nNES. He began as a mechanical toy whose goal\nwas to hype the launch\nof the console more than\nhaving a practical or even\nremotely useful purpose,\nwith only two games supporting him. Despite his\npoor applicability, R.O.B.\nmanaged to make his first\non-screen appearance in\nSuper Smash Bros. Brawl\nand is now stronger than\never in Ultimate. He is a\nversatile, heavy character\nwith great long- and short-range options.\nR.O.B.\u2019s most important tools are his specials,\nstarting off with his neutral\nRobo Beam, which fires\na directable laser. This\nprojectile will keep opponents away with its decent\nknockback, but can\u2019t be\nused in rapid succession.\nIts power recharges pas-sively, maxing out when\nthe red LED on top of\nR.O.B\u2019s head is flashing.\nNext comes the heart of\nhis kit, his down-special, a\ncharged attack which fires\na spinning Gyroscope in\nfront of him. Not only\ncan this projectile stay on\nstage to add pressure, but\nR.O.B. (or an opponent)\ncan pick it up to throw\nit again in any direction.\nOne trick is to launch the\nGyro on the very edge of\nthe stage, preventing your\nopponent from simply\nclimbing up the ledge.\nBut in general, you should\nuse it to harass them from\nafar.\nEven if your opponent\ncomes too close, R.O.B.\nstill has many powerful\noptions, especially with\nhis side special, Arm\nRotor. It unleashes a\nseries of quick attacks\nwhilst spinning forwards,\nfollowed by a finishing\nblow which can kill at\n100%. And for the cherry\non top, this move can also\nreflect projectiles if timed\nright, a lesser known fact\nthat can take many opponents by surprise.\nAnd that\u2019s not all,\nbecause R.O.B.\u2019s side-smash has decent range,\nmaking it the perfect tool\nto hit hard whilst at a reasonably safe distance. You\ncan then follow up with\nyour neutral-air, which\nyou should be using a lot,\nto hit your opponent with\na fiery blast. All of this\ncan even be done safely\noff-stage thanks to his\nup-special Robo Burner,\none of the best vertical\nrecovery moves in the\ngame. It will, however,\nneed some downtime to\nrecharge its fuel gauge, so\nuse it sparingly.\nIn addition to his legendary off-stage mobility\nand edge guard, R.O.B.\npossesses an insane\ncombo game. Simple yet\neffective, both his down-and up-throws can be\nchained with a multitude\nof attacks depending on\nthe situation. You can\nperform tilts or jabs to get\nsome free damage or try\nan up-smash to go for the\nkill, if they are at a high\npercentage and you are\nfast enough. But for all\nyou Elite Smashers out\nthere, R.O.B. also has a\nmasterful zero to death\ncombo. It makes use of\nhis Gyro, neutral-air and\nside-special to erase one\nof your opponent\u2019s stocks\nin the right conditions\n(check out Beefy Smash\nDoods\u2019video for the exact\nguide).\nAs a personal favourite,\nI have to say that R.O.B.\nis one of the best and most\nenjoyable fighters to play.\nBut objectively, he does\nhave a lot going for him,\nwith a lot of versatility,\npower and potential,\nraising his status up to\nhigh-tier. However, he\ncan be easily punished if\nyou are too predictable\ndue to his large hit-box, so\nmake sure to use all your\noptions and mix things up\nto successfully destroy\nyour opponents!\nSmash Corner-Jigglypuff- The Elvis of the Pok\u00e9World\nT\nhis pink puff\nball originated in\n1996 as one of\nthe first original\n151 Pok\u00e9mon. However,\nit was her popularity in\nthe anime that got her into\nthe first Smash game, and\nevery game since. While\nnot being as amazing\nas she was in Melee,\nJigglypuff has definitely\nimproved over her last\ncouple of iterations.\nThe main game plan\nwith Jigglypuff is to wall\nout the opponent with an\nonslaught of aerials while\nalso setting up tech-chase\nsituations that can result\nin a rest K.O. (more on\nthis later).\nJigglypuff\u2019s forward air\nand back air have a sustained hitbox which stay\nout for quite a few frames,\nmeaning they are excellent\nat punishing the opponent\nfor approaching at the\nwrong time. You should\naim to string forward airs\ntogether when you want to\nget the opponent off stage\nat low percent. Her back\nair has insane knock-back\nand should be prioritised\nat high percent; careful\nthough, as using this\nmid-air causes Jigglypuff\nto turn around.\nJigglypuff\u2019s up-air is an\namazing juggling tool at\nmid percent and can even\ncombo into itself. It is not\na great kill option though,\nso just use this to rack up\ndamage.\nIf you find your\nopponent is attacking you\nwhile you\u2019re in shield a\nlot, a great option is to\njump out of your shield\nand immediately down\nair. If done right this is a\nfree 14% and probably\nmore if you get off a quick\nforward or neutral- air.\nSpeaking of her neutral\nair, it\u2019s a great \u2018get off me\u2019\ntool, coming out almost\ninstantly and lasting\nnearly half a second.\nAll of Jigglypuff\u2019s\naerials are made extremely good by the fact she has\nthe fastest air speed in the\ngame, coupled with her 6\njumps!\nJigglypuff\u2019s special\nmoves are very hit or\nmiss. Her neutral-special,\nRollout, charges up a\nrolling attack that shoots\nyou forward in a line.\nWhile sometimes useful\nas a recovery option, this\nshould be avoided as it is\nvery predictable, and a hit\ndoes not do much. Similarly, Sing (her up-special)\ndoes not have much use.\nIt makes the opponent fall\nasleep, allowing you to hit\nthem, but if you have the\nchance to hit the opponent\nwith this, chances are you\ncould have just forward\nsmashed them for the kill.\nHer side special Pound\nshould be used if the\nopponent shields a lot as\nit does massive shield\ndamage, but is otherwise\nnot a great option.\nRest however, being\nJigglypuff\u2019s down special,\nis what makes her terrifying in the hands of a\nskilled player. If you are\noverlapping a character,\nit will cause massive\ndamage and knockback,\nwhile also coming out\nnearly instantly. But if it\nmisses, Jigglypuff falls\nasleep, and so you should\nonly use rest if you know\nit will hit. Therefore, if\nyou hit the opponent to the\nground and they tech in a\ndirection you predicted,\nyou can chase them and\nrest for the kill. There are\nsome specific rest set ups\nthat \u201cOneShadyPuff\u201d goes\ninto detail on in YouTube.\nOverall, I would put\nThe Balloon Pok\u00e9mon in\nmid-tier. While she does\nhave insane kill power\nand great off-stage game,\nher limited pool of useful\nmoves combined with her\nbeing one of the lightest\ncharacters in the game\nmakes it difficult to win\nthe abundance of unfavourable matchups she\nhas. Nevertheless, if you\nput the time into getting\ngood with her you can\ndefinitely wipe the smirk\noff your enemies\u2019 faces.\nHappy smashing!\nGAMES\nGAMES\nMichael Cognet\nGames Writer\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Writer\nTerminator 6: When Good Robots Go Bad // Nintendo\nJigglypuff having an allergic reaction // Nintendo\n\n"

Last year saw\nsales of meat-free food\nincrease by a staggering\n987%, with everyone\nfrom Beyonce to Benedict\nCumberbatch getting in\non the action. Like it or\nnot, plant based (read:\nvegan) food is here to\nstay. But saving the planet\ndoesn\u2019t have to mean sacrificing culinary pleasure,\nor indeed saving your\nown body; while in days\ngone by the first casualty\nof a meat-free diet was\nfast food, today\u2019s veggies\nand vegans have plenty of\noptions that hit both those\nsalty and sugary sweet\nspots. Both authors being\nvegetarians who\u2019ve struggled to commit entirely to\nveganism, who better to\ngive the verdict on vegan\njunk food?\nThe setting\nBoxpark Shoreditch: If\nyou\u2019ve ever been to a container park before, you\u2019ll\nfeel like you already\nknow this place pretty\nwell \u2013 the usual blend\nof hipster brunch joints\nand edgy chip shops are\nall here. Things are kept\nnice and simple upstairs:\ncommunal bench seating\nand plenty of natural light\ngive it a relaxed, airy feel.\nPoints for having a well-stocked bar, which would\nbe great on a summer\nafternoon; we went in the\npissing rain instead.\nThe food\nBiff\u2019s Jack Shack\n(BJS) gets its name from\njackfruit, a large fruit\nnative to India. Neither\n\u201cWe were\nunanimous in\nour feelings\ntowards the\naioli: this\nis the most\nimpressive\npart of the\nwhole meal\u201d\n\u201cOn all counts,\nthe Big Jack\nburger passes\nwith flying\ncolours \u2013 this is\nno stodgy Big\nMac\u201d\nof us had tried jackfruit in\nany of its guises before.\nBJS managed to create an\nentire menu from it, with\nthe classic jackfruit-as-pulled-pork fare joined\nby innovative jackfruit\nburgers, wings, and chilli.\nWings\nOur introduction to\njackfruit came in the\nform of buffalo \u2018wings\u2019,\ncomplete with blue\n\u2018cheese\u2019 dip. Immediately,\nit\u2019s clear why jackfruit\nlends itself so easily to\npulled pork; its stringy,\nfibrous texture is unlike\nany other vegetable. BJS\nhave a really good stab at\nworking the jackfruit into\nsomething chicken-esque,\nand while it\u2019s unlikely to\nfool a regular at KFC, the\nwingsworkwellenoughto\nbe enjoyable in their own\nright, complete with sugar\ncane \u2018bones\u2019. The chefs\nseem to really know their\nstar ingredient, with an\nextra crispy breadcrumb\ncoating guarding against\njackfruit\u2019s tendency to\ngo a bit mushy. Our only\ncriticisms would be of\nthe accompaniments; the\nbuffalo sauce is a little on\nthe sharp side, even for\nthose who usually douse\ntheir chips in vinegar, and\nthe blue \u2018cheese\u2019 doesn\u2019t\nhave enough in the tank to\nstand up to it. Maybe try\none of the other wings\u2026\nBurgers\nWhat do you want in\na burger? As far as we\u2019re\nconcerned, a burger\u2019s\nfunction is essentially\nto satisfy that desire\nfor something solid,\nsomething heavy, that\nfills a hole when you\u2019re\nabsolutely famished or to\nfill your stomach before a\nsolid night out. It doesn\u2019t\nhave to be meat, or even\nmeaty \u2013 a satisfying bite\nand some decent relish is\nall we ask for.\nOn all counts, the Big\nJack burger passes with\nflying colours. The Big\nJack is BJS\u2019s entry-level\noffering, and at \u00a37.50\nstraddles fast food and\ngourmet burger pricing.\nThis is no stodgy Big Mac,\nthough; everything \u2013 from\nthe wholesome seeded\nbun, to the genuinely\nfresh and crisp lettuce,\nto the burger sauce that\nyou\u2019d swear is the non-ve-gan original \u2013 everything\nsuggests quality. The\njackfruit patty itself offers\nplenty of texture and sub-stance, although you\u2019d be\nhard pressed to pin down\nits flavour in amongst\neverything else. Trying\nit by itself (sans bun,\nsalad, sauce), the patty\u2019s\nsubtle herby flavour is a\nwelcome surprise, and\nit\u2019s something of a shame\nthat it\u2019s overwhelmed by\neverything else.\nIf strong flavours are\nyour jam, though, you\nmay prefer the creative-ly-named Samuel Hell\nJackson burger. There\u2019s a\nlot going on in here, not\nleast the punchy jalapeno\npeppers \u2013 this one\u2019s not\nfor korma fans. That being\nsaid, there\u2019s plenty to\nenjoy if you\u2019re a certified\nspice aficionado, and the\npricing is still reasonable\nat \u00a39.\nAnd so to our side\nof choice: dirty fries,\ncomplete with vegan aioli\nand maple cured \u2018bacon\u2019\njam. The latter split the\nauthors \u2013 too sweet for\none of us, bang on for\nthe other. If you\u2019re into\nthat whole sweet BBQ\nsauce thing then you\u2019ll\nprobably love it. We were\nunanimous, though, in our\nfeelings towards the aioli:\nthis is the most impressive\npart of the whole meal.\nAs non-vegans, we are\nno strangers to the garlicy\nmayonnaise and it is\nindistinguishable from the\negg-based original.\nThe verdict? Vegan\njunk food is just as good\nas your meaty alternative\nif done right. Stay tuned\nfor further instalments!\nThe delicious Samuel Hell Jackson burger // Simran Kukran\nBiff\u2019s Jack Shack\u2019s dirty fries // Simran Kukran\n\n"

ETFs, in essence,\nare securities that are\nlisted on stock exchanges\nand can be traded just like\nstocks. An ETF tracks a\nbasket of securities that\ncould range from indexes,\nstocks, bonds, to even\ncommodities. Popular\nETFs include the SPDR\nS&P 500 ETF (SPY) that\ntracks the S&P500 Index,\nVanguard Total Stock\nMarket ETF (VTI) that\ntracks the market-capital-isation weighted index of\nthe entire U.S. equities\nmarket, and the United\nStates Oil Fund (USO)\nthat tracks the price of\nWest Texas Intermediate\n(WTI) light, sweet crude\noil.\nSince ETFs are traded\non the stock exchange,\nthey are priced and traded\ncontinuously throughout\na trading day. Moreover,\nETFs can be sold short\nor bought long and are\ntraded just like stocks.\nOne main advantage\nthat ETFs offer is the\nlow-cost diversification\nto minimise unsystematic\nrisk during investing. For\ninstance, mutual funds \u2013\nprofessionally managed\ninvestment funds which\npool small sums of\nmoney from various retail\ninvestors to buy a basket\nthe emergence of ETFs\nwith high leverages.\nLeveraged ETFs increases\nexposure to a certain\nindex or asset class and\nan example would be\ntriple-leveraged ETFs\nthat triple the exposure\nfor an investor. Some\npopular triple-leveraged\nETFs would be Direxion\nDaily Financial Bull 3X\nshare (Ticker: FAS) or\nProShares UltraPro Short\nS&P500 (Ticker: SPXU),\nwith FAS holding a long\nposition for financial\nsector stocks and SPXU\nholding a short position\nfor S&P500 index.\nNevertheless,leveraged\nETFs have a multitude\nof flaws and inherent\nriskiness associated with\nthem. Na\u00efve investors\nwould believe that triple-leveraged ETFs would\nproduce triple the daily\nreturn for the underlying\ninvestment (i.e. triple\nthe return of the index in\nthe long term). However,\nin the long term, such\nleveraged ETFs have a\nnegative bias and would\nrarely match triple the\nunderlying investment\nperformance. Let\u2019s\ndemonstrate this in the\nfollowing example:\nsuppose we are tracking\nan index that starts at\n$100 and increases by\n30% on the first day\n($130) and falls 10% on\nthe second day ($117) and\nfalls another 20% on the\nlast day ($93.6) with an\noverall net loss of 6.4%\nover the 3 day period. The\ntriple-leveraged index\nincreases the exposure\nby 3 times, i.e. a loss\nof 20% is magnified to\n60%. Suppose the triple-leveraged index starts at\n$100, at the end of the first\nday, it increases by 90%\n($190), decreases by 30%\non the second day ($133)\nand decreases by 60%\non the last day ($53.2).\nOverall, the net loss to an\ninvestor would be 46.8%.\nThis demonstrates the\nnegative bias of a triple-leveraged index which\nnegative bias inherent to\nleveraged ETFs dictates\nthat such ETFs should\nnot be held as a long-term investments but\nshould be used instead\nby professional traders\nwho use them as a hedge\nagainst big market moves\nin the short term. Jack\nBogle criticised leveraged\nor inverse ETFs investors\nas \u201cFruitcakes, Nut Cases\nand Lunatic Fringes\u201d.\nWhile broad-based ETFs\ncan act to diversify risk,\nretail investors need to be\nwary of exotic ETFs that\ntend to suffer from higher\nvolatility.\nof securities \u2013 charge\nhigher fees (average of\n0.51% expense ratio)\nrelative to ETFs (average\nof 0.21% expense ratio,\nwith some brokers even\noffering commission-free\nETFs).\nMoreover, the passive\ninvesting nature of\nETFs aims to track the\nperformance of major\nindexes (e.g. S&P500 or\nFTSE100), that provides\nreturns that are similar\nto that of active fund\nmanagers that own\na diversified market\nportfolio. According to\nJack Bogle, the founder of\nthe Vanguard Group and\none of the pioneers of the\nindex funds movement,\nwho believes in the cost-matters hypothesis that\nposits why index funds\nare so successful: The\nnet return to an investor\nis equal to the gross\nreturn in the market as\na whole, less the costs\nof obtaining that return.\n(Surprisingly, Jack Bogle\nis not a staunch supporter\nof the efficient market\nhypothesis that postulates\nthe best way to beat the\nmarket would be to invest\nsolely in the indexes.)\nGiven that passive index\nfunds provide a similar\nreturn to active fund\nmanagers at a much lower\nadministrative cost, the\nnet return for a passive\nindex fund would be\nhigher than the net returns\nfor active investing with\nfund managers in the long\nrun.\nWith the rising\npopularity of ETFs, a\nmultitude of niche ETFs\ntargeted at niche areas\nof the market such as the\nbiotech and healthcare\nsector e.g. HealthShares\nEmerging Cancer ETF or\neven socially responsible\nETFs catered towards\nESG investors.\nSince ETFs are\ngenerally more passive\nand track a basket of\nsecurities, this has led to\n\u201cMore than\n4,500 ETFs\nmanaged over\n4.46 trillion\nUSD worth\nof assets in\n2017\u201d\nETF\u2019s have be driven by the demand for technology in the indutry // Euronext\nAnInsightintoETFs-TheFutureofInvesting\nWill the Fed continue down its hawkish path? //Global Investors\ndoes not simply match\ntriple the underlying\ninvestment performance.\nThe magnified\nexposure, volatility and\nISSUE 1713\nFELIX\n21\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nDike Dijemeni\nEsuabom Dijemeni\nA\nccording to The\nGlobal Impact\nI n v e s t i n g\nN e t w o r k\n(GIIN), impact investment can be defined as\ninvestment made into\ncompanies, organisations,\nand funds with the intention to generate social\nand environmental impact\nalongside a financial\nreturn. Hence, impact\ninvesting in Africa is the\ndeployment of investment\nin African companies,\norganisations, and funds\nwith intentions to generate social, health, and\nenvironmental impact\nalongside a financial\nreturn. It is important\nto note that categorical\nimpact investing in Africa\nis significantly different\nfrom charitable aids given\nto Africa as the latter\ndoes not usually drive\ninvestment / financial\nrewards for the charity\ngiver. Impact investment\nin Africa attracts a broad\nrange of investors, primarily fund managers,\ndevelopment finance\ninstitutions, institutional\ninvestors, and founda-tions. There is a broad\nrange of asset classes\nthe reality. According to\na UNDP study \u201cImpact\nInvestment in Africa:\nTrends, Constraints and\nOpportunities\u201d, the 9 key\nchallenges facing impact\ninvestment in Africa are:\n1. General lack of\nawareness and\nunderstanding of\nimpact investment;\n2. Difficulty in sourcing\nviable investments\nthat meet both\nfinancial and social/\nenvironmental\nobjectives in Africa;\n3. Limited availability\nof innovative fund\nand deal structures;\n4. Difficulty exiting\ninvestments;\n5. Poor visibility\nand inadequate\nrecognition of social\nenterprise status;\n6. Lack of capital\nsupply across the\nrisk/return spectrum;\n7. Inadequate policy\nand regulatory\nenvironment;\n8. Poor linkages\nbetween social\nenterprise, investors,\nand innovation\nnetworks; and\n9. Poor and inconsistent\nimpact measurement\npractice.\nIn order to address the\nhighlighted challenges\nfacing impact investment\nin Africa, the Impact\nInvestment Action Plan\nwasdevelopedasshownin\nFigure 1. The primary aim\nof the Impact Investment\nin Africa Action Plan is to\nsupport the development\nof a vibrant impact\ninvestment sector on the\nAfrican continent. The\noverarching vision is the\ndevelopment of a vibrant\nimpact investment sector\nin Africa. The stated\nvision is further supported\nwith five key intermediate\noutcomes and a supporting\npan-African action plan\nand action network as in\nFigure 2.\nOne of the leading\nUK impact investment\nfirms with an African\nfocus is Uhusiano\nCapital Ltd. Uhusiano\nCapital is a boutique,\nregulated, financial\nadvisory firm based in\nLondon with a specialist\nteam primarily focused\non impact investment in\nAfrica. Uhusiano Capital\naddresses the capital\nneeds for African-based\nprojects and opportunities.\nThe firm is driven\nby a strong founding\nprinciple grounded in the\nfundamental belief that\ncommercial capital and\nimpact/social capital can\ncome together to generate\nsustainable long-term\nprojects/funds/products\nin Africa. Founded in\n2016 and incorporated\nin 2017 by Christelle\nKupa, Uhusiano Capital\nhas grown to establish\nits expertise in three key\ndomains: capital raising,\ndeal flow origination and\nstrategic marketing.\nUhusiano Capital\u2019s\ncapital raising team offers\nan innovative approach\nto raising capital for\nexceptional projects\nand/or companies by\nutilising its deep and well-entrenched experience\nin the impact investment\ncommunity in African\nmarkets. By utilising its\ninnovative capital raising\napproach, Uhusiano\nCapital is able to bridge\nthe gap between impact\ninvestors and impact\nopportunities in a unique\nand transformational way.\nUhusiano Capital\u2019s\ncapital deal flow\norigination team are world\nleaders in harnessing the\nvast global network to\nsupport impact investors,\nwhether new or well-experienced, to clearly\nand objectively identify\nthe most talented and\nundiscovered mangers\nand projects in order to\nachieve their investment\nobjectives: financial and\nsocial/impact gains.\nNavigating the African\nimpact investment\necosystem is challenging,\ndifficult, and sometimes\nalmost impossible.\nUhusiano Capital\u2019s\nstrategic marketing team\nover the years have\ndeveloped revolutionary\nstrategic marketing\nsolutions and impact\ninvestment advisory\nteams and services\nto make navigating\nand marketing impact\ninvestments in Africa\nsimple, effective, and\nrewarding. Furthermore.\nUhusiano Capital\u2019s\nstrategic marketing\nteam provides strategic\nrecommendations and\ndeep insights for making\nmeaningful marketing\nof impact investments in\nAfrica.\nIn conclusion, Impact\nInvestment in Africa has\na gigantic potential to\nrevitalise, recapitalise\nand rejuvenate\nAfrican economies,\nAfrican projects,\nAfrican businesses\nand most importantly,\nAfrican people.\nHowever, fundamental\nunderstanding of the\nconceptual imperatives\nof Impact Investing\nin African and the\npracticality and nuisances\nof impact investing in\nAfrica is central and at\nthe heart of whether or\nnot impact investment\nwill deliver on its lofty\npotentials in Africa. A\nstrong belief in innovative\nand philosophical driven\nfirms with Africa-focused\nimpact investment\nand Africa expertise\nlike Uhusiano Capital\nplays a significant role\nin translating impact\ninvestment concepts into\nfinancial returns and\nsocial/environmental\nimpacts in African\neconomies.\nwhich includes: equity,\ncommodity, fixed income,\nforeign exchange, proper-ty, and derivates. Actual\nnumerical quantification\nand data on the market\nsize of impact investing\nin Africa remains very\nlimited.\nThe Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals\n(SDGs) framework\ndeveloped by United\nNations serves as a driving\nforce and framework\nfor impact investing in\nAfrica. An Annual Impact\nInvestor Survey report\nby The GIIN showed\nthat more than half of\nimpact investors are\ntracking some or all of\ntheir performance against\nSDGs. Furthermore,\nthere is strong appetite\nfor impact investors to\ncatalyse impact investing\ntowards SDGs. However,\nthe United Nations\ncontinues to argue the\ncase for more capital and\ninvestment deployment\nto drive and grow impact\ninvesting in Africa and on\na global scale. The UN\nestimates that USD 5-7\ntrillion is needed annually\nto achieve the goals.\nImpact investing\nhas been hailed as a\ntransformational and\nrevolutionary investment\nmethodology for\nrevitalising and growing\nAfrican economies.\nHowever, the vision is\nincreasingly distant from\nFigure1 // Impact Investment in Africa\nImpact Investing in Africa\nFigure 2 // Impact Investment in Africa\nInvestment Writers\n\n"

Other books\nare to be savoured, each\nsentence in its perfect\ncomposition wondered\nover. Very rarely, a book\nis both. The Neapolitan\nquartet, I would argue,\nis the platonic ideal of\nthe form. Epic enough\nin scope to make any\nworld building fantasy\nwriter envious, and\nacute enough in its\nexploration of domestic\nintimacy, the four novels\nare of that unusual breed\nof fiction that doesn\u2019t\nseem to be fiction at all.\nThe series, which\nbegins with My Brilliant\nFriend, follows the lives\nof two women born in\nNaples just after the\nSecond World War.\nElena Greco, affectionately called Lenu, the\ndaughter of a porter, and\nRaffaella \u201cLila\u201d Cerullo\nthe daughter of the local\nshoemaker come from\npoor families, but both\nseem destined to leave\ntheir impoverished\nbeginning behind. The\ntwo meet in elementary\nschool where Lenu, a\nprecocious, conscientious girl, if a little\ntimid, is top of the class.\nIn contrast to the well\nbehaved, rather angelic\nLenu, Lila is half feral.\nScrawny, brash, and apt\nto throw stones at the\nneighbourhood boys,\nLila, even to the adults\naround her, seems just\na little scary.

It\u2019s time for the old structures to be torn down and for a new\ndemocratic, transparent, accessible and member-led Union to take its place.\nCOMMENT\nAnsh Bhatnagar\nComment Writer\nH\now much of\na say do we\nreally have\nin what the\nUnion does? Whether\nintroducing sweeping\nchanges such as a whole\nnew representation\nnetwork (the Wellbeing\nRep Network), implementing programmes like\nICXP (Imperial Clubs\nExperience Project),\ntampering with election\ntimetables (Leadership\nElections 2018), or\nremoving meat from\nthe menus (Meat-Free\nMonday), the Union\nalways acts according to\nthe whims of those at the\ntop. Consultation of members is seldom carried out\nand even consultation with\nUnion Council members\nis virtually non-existent.\nI know this because I\nhave sat on Council for a\nyear and a half, and many\nfellow Council members\nagree with me when I say\nthat we feel locked out.\nUnion Council is meant\nto be the main representative body of the Union,\nsetting policy and determining the direction of\nthe Union in collaboration\nwith the sabbs (President\n+ Deputy Presidents).\nHowever, what has Union\nCouncil actually done? I\ncan list a few good results\nto come out of Council,\nsuch as introducing\nharsher punishments for\nstudent volunteers found\nguilty of sexual harass-ment, and when it voted to\nsupportourstaffduringthe\npensions dispute last year.\nHaving been on the picket\nlines on the majority of\nthe strike days and talking\nto staff, I know it made a\nreal difference for them\nto hear that students back\nthem against the university leadership.\nHowever, the current\nsystem is an incredibly inaccessible and inefficient\nway to create policy. Most\nstudents don\u2019t even realise\nthat they can write a\nCouncil paper. Even when\na paper gets to Council,\nthe debate is often poor\nand gets stuck on small\ntechnicalities. People talk\nover each other and points\nare left unaddressed. Even\nafter a motion passes this\ndoesn\u2019t guarantee change.\nIf the Union doesn\u2019t\nactually implement\nmotions nothing changes!\nThis is a pressing issue\nas there are numerous\nmotions that have gotten\npast Council that Union\nhas not yet implemented.\nLast year I proposed\na motion for a petitions\nsystem that would make\nit easier for students\nto propose motions. A\nwatered down version\nof this was passed in\nFebruary 2018, with an\nimplementation date of\nthe Autumn Term 2018.\nAt this point in time, it\nhas been \u201cindefinitely\ndelayed\u201d. Two separate\npapers proposing a Social\nMobility Liberation\nOfficer were submitted\nlast year amidst reports\nthat Imperial was the\nmost unequal university\nin England. There was\na wide show of support\nfrom normal students\nfor the motion \u2013 Council\ndecided to instead run a\nconsultation on it. Again,\nthis has yet to be carried\nout despite it being\nmandated by Council.\nThe one time lots of\nnormal students showed\nup to Council, they were\ncompletely ignored.\nThis is the result not\nof the specific people\nrunning the Union, but of\nthe structure of the Union\nitself. It\u2019s why the situation stays the same every\nyear despite different\npeople being elected into\nthose positions. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter who you vote for\nbecause the system itself\nis rotten. Any system that\nprimarily empowers those\nat the top rather than the\nmass membership is a\nfundamentally flawed\nsystem, regardless of who\nis running things.\nNow this isn\u2019t an\nargument to not vote in\nthe upcoming Leadership\nElections \u2013 please make\nsure you do. The argument\nis that although the Union\nprides itself on being\nhaving very low turnout,\nthere simply wasn\u2019t\nenough momentum to\ntake it off the ground.\nThis is why I have\nproposed a motion to the\nnext Union Council for\nthe Union to set in motion\na complete restructure\nof itself that prioritises\ndemocracy, transparency,\nand accountability. It\nneeds to become mem-ber-led \u2013 meaning that\nall us students, together,\nare leading the way and\nsetting policy. It needs\nto empower anyone who\nwishes to get involved and\nit needs to act upon what\nthe student body wants,\neffectively and efficient-ly. However, this is too\nimportant a decision to be\nleft solely to Council. The\nrestructure will be developed in a group consisting\nof a wide range of students\nsuch as sabbs, academic\nand wellbeing reps, CSP\ncommittee members,\nand most importantly,\nnormal students like you.\nEveryone should get a say\nin what the new Union\nlooks like: a member-led\nUnion brought about by a\nmember-led process.\nThis is where you\ncome in. Union Council\nmust first set in motion\nthis process so that we\ncan get started on developing a new system for\nnext year. Contact your\nCouncil Reps to ensure\nthey vote for this, contact\nme (ab4616@ic.ac.uk) if\nyou have any ideas, and\nmost importantly, feel free\nto turn up to the meeting\non Tuesday, at 6:30pm in\nRSM G1 to talk to your\nrepresentatives and to\nshow your support!\nImperial College Union / / Imperial College London\ndemocratic, it thinks that\ndemocracy is simply\nvoting in an election\nevery now and then. Real\ndemocracy is all year\nround. Our voices deserve\nto be heard and our wishes\ndeserve to be acted upon\nthroughout the year,\nbecause it\u2019s our Union.\nIt is an organisation that\nis meant to represent us\ncollectively, and it\u2019s about\ntime it did. In fact, talks\nwere had in mid-2018\nbetween last year\u2019s Union\nPresident and volunteers\nabout a radical change\nin the way the Union is\nrun, with some very good\nideas being proposed.

Ultimate\nConner Flynn from GadgetReview.com reviews some of the latest Smash controllers available on the market.\nGAMES\nConner Flynn\nGames Writer\nS\nuper Smash Bros. Ultimate is all the rage.\nNintendo Switch users have been waiting a long\ntime for this brawler. This game is awesome because every character, throughout all the Smash\ngames, is now playable \u2013 as well as new characters to\nhit the scene. New features allow players to battle over\nmultiple arenas and there are new gameplay modes to\nexplore and enjoy.\nFans of the game will already be familiar with the\nGameCube Controller, and now there\u2019s a new Super\nSmash Bros. Ultimate GameCube controller available\nfor sale. Many, though, will only play this game using\na Gamecube style controller; if that\u2019s your preference,\nhere are some great choices!\nPowerA GameCube Style Wireless\nController for Nintendo Switch\nBeing the only wireless GameCube controller\nlicensed by Nintendo, the Power A GameCube controller is the latest and greatest, improving on some of\nthe features of past GameCube controllers. It runs on\ntwo AA batteries and comes in three different colors.\nAnother cool feature is the LED light that displays the\nplayer number, which also flashes to show you when\nyour battery needs to be replaced. For those who are not\nfans of replacing batteries, there is also a wired model\navailable. It\u2019s also worth knowing that this is the only\nGameCube controller that can still be used when the\nSwitch is undocked, without using an adapter. It\u2019s easy\nto see why this controller is a hit with the fans!\nHori Nintendo Switch Battle Pad\nThe Hori Nintendo Switch Battle Pad connects to the\nSwitch with a USB port, but the technological precision\nof attack functions are just insane. You can also customize the shoulder buttons to adapt to your favorite form\nof gameplay. It also packs in Switch system buttons\nlike home, screenshot and +/-. The textured grip will\ngive you better control all around. Like the others on\nthis list, it is a popular choice for playing Super Smash\nBros. The Hori comes in five different varieties, which\nmimic some of our favorite Super Smash Bros. char-acters. These versions include: Zelda, Luigi, Pikachu,\nPrincess Peach and Mario. They come in bright colors\nand all of the controllers, except for the Pikachu model,\nare translucent.\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nGameCube Controller\nThis special edition GameCube controller is reminiscent of the original 2002 gamepad, but with the latest\ntechnology built-in. The Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\nGameCube Controller is a wired controller, you can\neasily connect it to your Switch with a USB adapter\nor 8BitDo wireless adapter. This controller features an\noutline of the Smash logo, giving it the game\u2019s nod of\napproval. I have to admit, this one is my favorite! It\nlooks awesome with that Smash logo over black, and\nit\u2019s hard to improve on a classic at any rate.\nPDP Nintendo Switch Pikachu Wired\nFight Pad Pro\nAre you a Pokemon fanatic? Gotta catch \u2018em all? Or\ndo you just love Pikachu yellow? Either way, you\u2019ll\nlove this Pikachu Wired Controller, which combines the\nbest of the GameCube and Hori Controllers. The PDP\nhas system buttons, such as home, just like the Hori,\nand has a USB connection. What make it unique is the\ndetachable full-size analog stick that can be swapped\nout for the C-stick. That alone makes this controller\nvery versatile. This is the Smash Bros. controller of\nchoice for Pokemon fans. My new motto? Gotta Smash\n\u2018em all.\nWhile all of these controllers have very similar\nbuttons and designs, they each have a unique feature\nthat differentiates them from one another. Each is a great\nchoice for beating the hell out of your friends (all in fun\nand in-game of course!) Your choice may come down\nto a particular must-have function, or just be because\nthat particular controller comes in your favorite color.\nEither way, you\u2019ll have a blast playing Smash Bros.\nUltimate with any of these.\nNo matter which you choose, in the end, all that\nmatters is that you have a fun time playing the game \u2013\nand that you win of course! So get your headset on, grab\nyour controller and fight!\n\n"

    "content": "Lefty YouTubers event draws large crowds\nLast Tuesday\u2019s \u2018Politics in the Age of YouTube\u2019 event demonstrated the political progressivism\nwithin Imperial\nPOLITICS\nS\nhout out to\nSomething Awful\nforum poster\nSuperMechaGodzilla,\nwho, in 2013, posted a\nCommunist analysis of\nthe film Prometheus, and\nbasically radicalised me\non the spot\u201d. This was the\nanswer of Harry Brewis\n(Hbomberguy) to the\nquestion on how he was\nintroduced to leftism.\nWith such a starting shot,\nthe Politics in the Age of\nYouTube event on the\npast Tuesday 29th of\nJanuary chaired by ICL\nLabour Club\u2019s President\nAnsh Bhatnagar was anticipated to be quite a wild\nride. Him and three other\nfellow YouTubers debated\nfor two hours on current\npolitics, philosophy, and\nthe mechanics of video\nmaking.\n\u201cConservatives seemed\nquite hip when I was\nyoung. I used to be an\nquestion. Indeed, each of\ntheir paths towards leftism\nwere quite different. In the\ncase of Oliver Thorn (Phi-losophyTube), it was radi-calisation by \u201can unironic\nMarxist academic.\u201d\nThe conversation then\nmoved to the reasons why\nthey had decided to start\nmaking videos. \u201cInstead\nof posting hot takes on\nTwitter, I decided to make\nsomething and contribute\nto the conversation\u201d,\nstated Angie (Angie-Speaks, prefers to go by\nher first name). \u201cThere\u2019s\na section of the LefTube\ncommunity oversaturated\nwith content that focuses\non making fun of reac-tionaries. I wanted to go\na bit beyond that.\u201d Brewis\nalso weighted in: \u201cPeople\nhave to change their own\nminds and the best thing\nyou can do is giving them\nencouragement to do so.\u201d\n\u201cNot everyone can\nmake YouTube videos.\nThecreatorsaredisproportionally white cis males,\nand minority voices are\nvery uncommon. There\u2019s\nalso the fact that its is very\nAmerican. I would love to\nhear perspectives from\nother countries, though\nin many cases there is\na language barrier [that\nmakes the conversation\nharder].\u201d, said Thorn.\nBrewis was very hopeful\nin the power of this new\nmedia channel as a tool\nfor the empowerment of\nleftism: \u201cIf Left YouTube\nhad been present 4 years\nago, we may had had\nPresident Contrapoints [a\nfamous YouTube creator\nthat has done many videos\non politics and gender] by\nnow.\u201dAngie was also keen\nto share her experiences\nin the platform: \u201cOne of\nthe great things is that,\nnowadays, there\u2019s a very\nbig community of creators\nand subscribers that can\nprovide feedback to your\ncontent. They can tell you\nwhen you have made a bad\ntake, especially in videos\nwith controversial topics.\nI had a recent experience\nwith this, and people were\nvery constructive, except\nfor a couple of people that\ncame after me surprisingly viciously.\u201d\nOne of the main topics\ndiscussed was the state\nof trans rights in the\nUK. Brewis famously\ndid a day-long Donkey\nKong stream to raise\nfunds for Mermaids, a\ntrans-supporting charity\nthat has been relentlessly\nattacked by transphobes\nin social media. Why is\nthere such a backlash\nin this country against\ntrans rights? \u201cEngland\nis uniquely TERFy.\nMaybe because there\u2019s a\ntendency for middle class,\nwhite, centrist feminism\nin our media.\u201d, was the\nperspective of Thorn.\nBrewis\u2019 reasoning was\nsimilar: \u201cIt\u2019s the tabloids.\nEvery opinionator there\nthinks themselves as\nvaguely progressive, and\nwhen they find an issue\nthey do not understand\nthey have to have a take\non it. Mumsnet is a very\nBritish place. In England\nyou have former comedy\nwriters screaming all day\nabout the matter.\u201d\nAnd where is the\nmovement heading\nto? What plans do our\ncreators have for the\nfuture? \u201cI am going to\nkeep making weird shit.\nMy content has started\nbeing noticed by mainstream media, so there\u2019s\na bit of space for growing\nfrom here.\u201d, said Thorn,\nwho has been profiled by\nThe Atlantic and The New\nYork Times. \u201cI hope the\nLeftyTube communities\nmatures and gets rid of\nsome of its more shitty\nhabits. I would also like to\nsee a bigger challenge to\nthe liberal hegemony left\nof the centre.\u201d, remarked\nAngie. Jacobs was also\npositive about the future,\nthough much work still\nneeds to be done: \u201cWe\nneed to capture the narra-tive, ensure that ours and\nother yet unheard voices\nare effectively heard.\nWe are the future. It is a\ngradual process.\u201d\nThe event finished\nwith a Q&A round with\nthe audience. Hot topics\nlike gun control were\ndiscussed. Three of the\nguests happened to be\nquite in agreement in their\nposition on the matter:\n\u201cGun control has the\neffect of disproportionally\naffecting minorities first. I\nam in principle pro-gun,\nthough I understand the\ncontroversy with that.\nGun control was first instituted against the Black\nPanthers.\u201d, answered\nJacobs. Angie built up\non that argument: \u201cIf I\nlived in America, I would\nown a gun. Institutionally\nviolence is dispropor-tionally directed against\nPeople of Colour.\u201d.\nBrewis nodded in agree-ment: \u201cIt would be very\nnice if there were no guns\nat all, but in reality there\nare. I am with Angie, I\nhate guns, but if I lived in\nAmerica I would definitely buy one. Nonetheless, it\nis a complicated issue.\u201d\nIt was quite a popular\ntalk, judging from the\nfully packed room, one of\nthe lecture theatres in the\nSir Alexander Fleming\nBuilding. Imperial\nstudents seem to be\ngrowing more interested\nin politics, but will the\ntrend hold? We in the\nFelix Politics section very\nmuch hope so!\nPolitics in the Age of YouTube // Pixabay\nISSUE 1713\nFELIX\n7\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWe need to\ncapture the\nnarrative,\nensure that\nours and other\nyet unheard\nvoices are\neffectively\nheard\u201c\nJuan Ignacio Rubio\nPolitics Editor\nAnCap before moving\nwell to the left.\u201d remarked\nDavid Jacobs (BadMouse-Productions) to the same\n\n"

What would the\ntransition period mean to\ntrade and immigration?\nAre we going to remain in\nthe single market? What\nabout the customs union?\nAre we going to have a\nfree-trade agreement?\nWhat about the Backstop\nand Ireland? Are we going\nto have free movement?\nWhat about farming\nand fishing? What about\nresearch funding? When\ndo we get that \u00a3350m/\nweek for the NHS? What\nimpact does Brexit have\non the lives of people with\ndisabilities?\nsound familiar as they\nhave, and still are, being\ndiscussed (rightly so!).\nBut what about that last\none? Is there even any\nrelationship between the\nquality of life of people\nwith disabilities and\nBrexit? Spoiler Alert! Yes.\nLaws:\nThe EU Withdrawal\nAct converts current EU\nlaw into domestic law as\nwe leave ensuring enough\ntime for the UK to either\nmodify or remove some\nor all of the EU laws after\nthorough thought and\ndiscussion. The act also\nallows corrections to be\nmade to laws that are no\nlonger applicable once\nwe leave straight away.\nHowever, which EU laws\napply to people with disa-bilities?\nThe UK has generally\nbeen very good with disability laws and legisla-tions; for example, when\nthe UK passed the Chronically Sick and Disabled\nPersons Act in 1970, it\nwas the first legislation in\nthe world to recognise and\naward rights to disabled\npeople. In 1995 the Disability Discrimination Act\n(DDA) was introduced,\nwhich included education,\ntransport, and the provision of goods, facilities,\nservices, premises, employment and occupation.\nHowever, businesses with\nfewer than 20 employees\nwere protected if they discriminated on grounds of\ndisability. This exemption\nwas removed from UK\nlaw in 2004 after the EU\nlegislation, the Framework Directive for Equal\nTreatment in Employment\nand Occupation, came\ninto effect in 2000.\nIn 2008, discrimination\nagainst employees due\nto their carer status or\nrelationship to a disabled\nperson became unlawful\nin the UK as a result\nof a European Court of\nJustice Judgement. This\nwas an issue that was\nmissed in the DDA and\nmany people had suffered\nfrom \u2018discrimination by\nassociation\u2019. Imagine the\nimpact of being discriminated against due to your\nrelative/child/partner\nbeing disabled. Not only\nwould this put massive\nstresses on the family\u2019s\nfinancial situation but\nalso stress the relationships with the disabled\nperson. Not only that but\nthe mental stress that is\nplaced onto the disabled\nperson, knowing that their\nfamily is unemployable\nbecause of their disability\nis immense and this is in\naddition to all the other\nmental stresses that come\nwith a disability.\nFinance:\nThere is no doubt that\nmost disabilities incur\nextra costs to the person.\nWhether it is healthcare\ncosts, transport costs or\nequipment costs. The UK\ngovernment understands\nthis, and has created\nPersonal Independence\nPayments (PIP) to support\npeople with the extra\ncosts, allowing them to\nindependently contribute\nto society. The EU\u2019s regulation on the coordination\nof social security systems\nmeans that British\ncitizens eligible for PIP\ncan continue to receive it\nwhilst living in another\nEU country, extending the\nperson\u2019s independence\nacross the continent.\nNot only that but\nmaking the country more\naccessible and removing\nthe barriers faced by\npeople with disabilities in\nsociety requires re-plan-ning and costs. The EU\nsupports the UK with\nthese costs through the\nEU Structural and Investment Funds \u2013 which place\na great deal of emphasis\non anti-poverty and social\ninclusion measures.\nThe Future:\nThe European Accessibility Act, proposed\nin 2015, aims to set\nrequirements for products\nand services, such that\nthey are more accessible.\nFor example, trains and\nbusses to be designed\nwith accessibility in\nmind and cash machines\nto have headphone jacks\nfor the visually impaired,\namongst other things.\nLeaving the EU would\nprevent people with disabilities from benefiting\nfrom upcoming EU legislation on accessibility.\nAlthough the UK\nhas been a pioneer in\ndisability and inclusivity\nlegislations, the EU has\nhelped to shape and refine\nthe rules, such that no one\nis excluded and secondary\nissues of disability are\naccounted for. Leaving\nthe EU would not cause\na massive change in disability laws straight away;\nhowever, the UK would\nthen be able to \u2018roll back\u2019\nsome of the EU laws that\nprotect and enable the independence of those with\ndisabilities. This reduces\nthe power of the voice of\npeople with disabilities as\nthere would be a reduction\nin the domain of advocacy.\nWill the UK decide\nto \u2018roll back\u2019 the laws?\nI personally think that\u2019s\nunlikely (or at least I\nwould like to think so),\nsince the UK government\nhas a proven track record\nof caring for those with\ndisabilities. Also, more\nrecently, The Papworth\nTrust suggested that the\nUK is one of the best\nEU members in terms\nof treatment of disabled\npeople. Could financial\nhelp provided for people\nwith disabilities abroad\nbe affected? I think that\nwould be one of the most\nlikely changes we will see.\nI do however believe that\nsome collaboration with\nthe EU around disability\nAlthough the UK has been a pioneer in disability and\ninclusivity legislations, the EU has helped to shape and\nrefine the rules // Pxhere\n\u201cWhat impact\ndoes Brexit\nhave on\nthe lives of\npeople with\ndisabilities?\u201d\nSam Hasselgrove\n2018/19 ICU Disabilities\nOfficer\nIf you\u2019ve been following the Brexit process, all\nthese questions should\nwill be beneficial as there\nwould be a much bigger\npool of experience to\nenable us to create the best\nlaws. Even if it\u2019s just for\nhumanitarian purposes.\nHaveyoueverexperienced\ndiscrimination?\nH\nave you\never felt\nunintentionally,\ncasuallyorsubtly\ndiscriminated against within the\ncollege environment?

    "content": "Super Bowl LIII: GOAT defeats Rams\nThe events that took place on 03/02/2019 will not go down in history, well at least not for any good reasons\u2026\nSPORTS\nImraj Singh\nSports Editor\nF\nield general Tom\nBrady marches\ndown the field\nthrowing short\nbullets and long bombs.\nPrecise, calculated,\ncommanding and highly\nefficient. Ain\u2019t no mercy\nfor the weak.\nThis is the demi-god\nquarterback of yesteryear\nwho overcame the largest\npoint deficit ever recorded\nin Super Bowl history.\nHe cemented his place\nin the hall of fame and\nis the greatest of all time\n(GOAT). Period. What\u2019s\nhe doing now? This week\nin the life of Brady he\npolishes his super bowl\nrings, washes his cat,\ndrops his kids at school\nand wins the super bowl\nfor the sixth time\u2026\nYes, Brady has\ndone it again. Brady is\nnow the proud owner of\nhis sixth Super Bowl ring,\nwhich is the most by any\nplayer. Ever. His legacy\nand impact on football\nis far-reaching and\nthose with no interest in\nFootball still know of the\nlegend quarterback Tom\nBrady. This does come at\na cost, as he gets older he\nis starting to trip on his\nown legacy. Greatness is\nexpected and perfection\nis assumed, and although\nnot always charismatic,\nthe novelty of winning the\nSuper Bowl is obviously\nwearing thin. In the post-game interview, he said:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve, uh, been this far\nand lost, which is really\ntough,\u201d then added, \u201cI\nwish we\u2019d played a little\nbetter on offense, but\nwe won\u2026 Super Bowl\nchamps.\u201d I can imagine\na half-hearted fist pump\nwith a \u201cWoooooo!\u201d after\nthat statement. Maybe this\nspeaks to his exhaustion\nafter the game, or his\novercritical-ness and\npursuit of perfection, but\nfor me it speaks to routine.\nAfter 19 years of playing,\nand -rightfully- being\ngiven the title of GOAT,\nperhaps the routine of\nyear-on-year NFL makes\nthe thought of retirement\nmore appealing. He has\nnothing left to achieve,\nand is just padding his\n\u201cBrady\u2019s super\nbowel creates\nso much crap,\nif you gave him\nan enema he\u2019d\nonly weigh\n5lbs\u201d\n\u201cThey played\na 5 second\nversion which\nwas rudely\ninterrupted by\nrapper Travis\nScott\u2019s comet\u201d\nCV, adamant to play till\n45 years old.\nThe yearly routine also\ncomes with the klassik\nportrayal of the Patriots\nas underdogs. \u201cEveryone\nthinks we suck, and you\nknow, can\u2019t win any\ngames. \u2026 So, we\u2019ll see,\nit will be fun,\u201d Brady told\nCBS after the Patriots\u2019\ndivisional-round win over\nthe Chargers. Fam, you\nare part of the longest\ndynasty in Football\nhistory. Brady\u2019s super\nbowel creates so much\ncrap, if you gave him an\nenema he\u2019d only weigh\n5lbs. Okay, that was\nexcessive, but there does\nseem to be a Patriot franchise conspiracy to paint\nthemselves as underdogs.\nWith Bill Belichick at the\nhelm, Patriots have won\nsix Super Bowls and have\nbeen 1st in their division\nsixteen times since he\ntook the position of head\ncoach in 2000. They are a\ndynasty, with an ethos that\ncan be aptly summarized\nby Belichick\u2019s words after\nthey won Super Bowl LI:\n\u201cAs of today, and as great\nas today feels and as great\nas today is, in all honesty\nwe\u2019re five weeks behind\nin the 2017 season.\u201d This\ninexhaustible work ethic\nis what gives the Patriots a\nwinning season year after\nyear.\nThe franchise is able\nto create pro-bowl level\nathletes from those over-looked, including Brady\nand Edelman, who were\nsixth and seventh round\ndraft picks respectively.\nEdelman was the Super\nBowl LIII Most Valuable\nPlayer, although originally playing quarterback at\ncollege he transitioned to\nwide receiver and punt\nreturner for the NFL,\nand was overlooked by\nmany teams. The Patriots\nrecognize tenacity and\nambition, and channel it\nto develop these players\ninto superstars. It isn\u2019t just\nchance.\nWith all that in mind,\nthis Super Bowl has been\nthe most boring. It is just\nbleurgh. Patriots win,\nbleurgh. Most consecutive drives ending with\na punt in Super Bowl\nhistory (Rams), bleurgh.\nFewest points scored by\nthe winning team in Super\nBowl history, bleurgh. It\nwas a punt-a-thon (making\nthe title of this piece a bit\nmisleading, sorrry!) There\nwere NO touchdowns in\nthe first three quarters,\nand there were the fewest\ntouchdowns and fewest\npoints scored in Super\nBowl history. Just gross. I\ndon\u2019t even want to analyze\nplayer contribution or dive\ninto anaylsis about the\nRams (who I have failed\nto mention thus far), this\nis because the game will\nbe forgotten.\nThere was one way\nthey could have made it\nmemorable, one way they\ncould have inducted it into\npublic consciousness as a\nday of awe and spectacle,\none way they could have\nscribed it into annals of\ntime. That would have\nbeen with SpongeBob.\nA few months ago the\ncreator of SpongeBob\nSquarePants, Stephen\nHillenburg, died.

Veganism,\nit\u2019s fair to say, has recently\nexperienced a leap from\nthe fringe into the spot-light, with many reasons\nunderlying its ever-grow-ing popularity.\nOver 681,000 people\nin the UK (approximately\n1% of the population)\ncurrently follow a vegan\ndiet: a number predicted\nto increase by 327% in the\ncoming year, while google\nsearches for \u2018vegan\u2019\nquadrupled between 2012\nand 2017, exceeding both\n\u2018vegetarian\u2019 and \u2018gluten\nfree\u2019 search terms. Participation in the Veganuary\ncampaign (which has\napproximately doubled\nwith each successive year\nsince its establishment\nin the UK in 2014), has\nmeanwhile peaked again\nthis year with an estimated\n300,000 new participants.\nSuch a dramatic swing\nhas prompted many to\nwonder: what concerns\nare driving our blossoming appetite for conscious\nconsumerism when it\ncomes to abstaining from\nproducts borne of animal\nexploitation? Early teach-ings, such as those found\nin Jainism, Buddhism\nand Hinduism, alongside\nthe views of prominent\nfigures including Pythagoras and Plutarch, have\ntraditionally considered\nmoral and ethical issues\nsurrounding the relationship between humans\nand animals. Are modern\nminds changing en masse\naccording to these ideas,\nor is there more to it?\nIndeed, much of the\nmodern focus remains\n(appropriately) on the\ninjustices committed\nagainst animals for the\nproduction of meat,\ndairy, eggs and other\nanimal-derived products,\nwith a growing number of\ndocumentaries portraying\nthe treatment of animals\nused for food production.\nHowever, the interest\nfuelling this modern surge\ntowards plant-based living\nextends beyond concerns\nrelating to ethics and\nmorals, rather, tapping\ninto mounting worries\nsurrounding the impact of\nAn ever-growing body\nof science continues\nto support the positive\nimplications of adopting\na plant-based lifestyle\nwith regard to our health\nand the planet. From the\nperspective of health,\na vegan diet has been\nshown to offer protection against numerous\nconditions including\nobesity, type 2 diabetes\nand cardiovascular mor-tality. Meanwhile, only\nthose living under rocks\ncould manage to miss\nthe mounting evidence\nrevealing the disturbing\nand staggering contributions of animal agriculture\ntowards deforestation,\nspecies extinction, and\nglobal warming. Given\nthe increasing availability\nof this information to an\never more informed pop-ulation, the rapidity with\nwhich the vegan message\ncontinues to chime with a\ngrowing portion of society\nis hardly surprising.\nLooking at results from\na survey of participants\nin the 2018 campaign, as\nreported by Plant Based\nNews, 43% of respondents listed animal welfare\nand rights issues as\nVeganuary-thechallengetoeataplant-baseddietinthemonthofJanuaryhasseenmorepeopleandbusinesses\ntaking part in 2019 than ever before.

India is the\nworld biggest democracy\nwith almost 900 million\nregistered voters and\nthis year\u2019s Lok Sabha\nelections (India\u2019s Lower\nHouse of Parliament) is\na wide open contest, with\nno clear winner in sight.\nBefore we move forward,\nlet us recognise the important role Imperial College\nhas played in India\u2019s\nwidely respected Election\nCommission. It was an\nalumnus of our univer-sity, Sukumar Sen, who\nserved as independent\nIndia\u2019s first Chief Election\nCommissioner and was\ntasked to do the improba-ble: conduct a multi-party\nelection in a country that\u2019s\n80% illiterate in 1950. Of\nthe many challenges that\nawait India in the coming\ndecades, the survival of\ndemocracy is not one\nof them. In the last 70\nyears each succeeding\ngovernment has peacefully transferred power.\nThis by no means was a\npre-ordained feat \u2013 India\u2019s\nneighbourhood is crowded\nwith failed states, military\ndictatorships and the most\npowerful communist\nregime in the world.\nIn many regards the\nupcoming election is\nnot one election, but\nmany regional ones with\nregional leaders confronting regional issues.\nFor India is a microcosm\nof the United Nations,\nwith 22 major languages\n(with over a million\nnative speakers each) and\nsignificant religious and\ncultural diversity.\nIn 2014, Narendra\nModi\u2019s party (BJP)\nachieved what no other\nIndian Prime Minister\nachieved since Rajiv\nGandhi\u2019s landslide victory\nin 1984, that is to win an\noutright parliamentary\nmajority. Yet, if current\npolls are to be believed,\nthen coalition governments are set to return.\nCoalitions in India are\nnever between two parties,\nbut as in 2004 to 2014, the\ngoverning coalition consisted of over 22 political\nparties with a further 8\nparties providing external\nsupport. The current Lok\nSabha consists of 36\nparties \u2013 now that\u2019s a true\nmulti-party system.\nIn season three of\nBlackadder, set in\nGeorgian England,\nBlackadder informs\nBaldrick (representing the\ncommon man) that to be\nan MP a criminal record\nis a prerequisite. Whilst\nthe UK has moved away\nfrom the rotten boroughs\nof the nineteenth century,\nin India progress moves\nmore slowly. The wide\nscale criminalisation of\npolitics has meant that\nwhichever party you vote\nfor, one thing will always\nbe constant, at least a third\nof MPs will have serious\ncriminal cases against\nthem. Now that is true\nbipartisanship. However,\nsaying that, it would\nbe lazy to fall victim to\nbothsidesism, and not\nrecognise the significant\ndifferences and policy\nrecords.\nA year and a half ago,\nthe Modi-led BJP NDA\n(national democratic\nalliance) government\nseen genuine economic\nimprovements with India\nachieving its best rank\non the World Bank ease-of-doing-business index\nand strong GDP growth\nfigures (+7%) whilst controlling inflation to below\n3%, ultimately Modi has\nbecome a victim of unrealistic promises he made\nback in 2014. Persistently\nhigh joblessness, agricultural distress resulting in\nindebted farm workers\nand high non-performing\nasset ratio amongst India\u2019s\nstate-owned banks have\nstifled the true potential of\nIndia\u2019s economy. Amidst\nthis disappointed climate,\nthe opposition has sensed\nits opportunity. To prevent\na repeat of 2014, opposition parties have united\nto form an anti-BJP coali-tion, often with their past\nenemies, realising that\nonly a united opposition\ncan stop the Modi jugger-naut. The past few months\nhave seen the BJP falter\nin the Hindi-speaking\nheartland, which played a\nvital role in their success\nin 2014. From losing\nthe chief-ministership in\nMadya Pradesh, Rajasthan\nand Chhattisgarh to even\nloosing key by-elections\nin the all-important state\nof Uttar Pradesh.\nYet behind the facade\nof opposition unity, there\nis already tension brewing\nover who would be the\nprime-ministerial candi-date. The only pan-India\npolitical party other than\nthe BJP is the Congress\nparty (which has ruled\nIndia for 50 of the 70 years\nsince independence). Consequently, many Congress\nleaders have publicly said\nthat any prime-ministe-rial candidate must come\nfrom within their party.\nThis has irked many\nregional leaders who have\nambitions of their own.\nDespite the re-energised\nspirit shown by Rahul\nGandhi, president of the\nCongress party and the\nheir to the Nehru-Gandhi\npolitical dynasty (no\nrelation to Mahatma\nGandhi), the Indian youth\nhave grown tired of\ndynastic politics. India is a\nyoung country, with 65%\nof the population under\nthe age of 35 living in a\nhighly competitive world.\nIt is no wonder that in the\nlast election, the youth\noverwhelmingly voted for\nthe candidate who represented meritocracy. Modi\ndidn\u2019t have a famous political family nor wealth to\nbuy his way to power - he\nis a self-made man who,\nin his youth, use to sell tea\non railway stations.\nIn the wide canopy of\nmud-slinging attacks, the\nreal issues facing voters\nare getting ignored. The\nrising economic inequal-ity, the abject failure of\nstate education and the\nabsolute absence of public\nhealthcare has been but\non the back-burner of political discourse. Instead\nof real policy debates\nto reduce crime and the\nnecessary judicial reforms\nor the necessary policies\nrequired to protect the\nenvironment, the Indian\nmedia has chosen to focus\nits attention to partisan\npolitics devoid of any\nsubstance. Take the recent\nbudget presented by\nthe government \u2013 little\nattention has been paid\nto the details on how to\nfinance the proposed universal healthcare scheme,\ndespite there being\nnumerous 24/7 news\nchannels. However plenty\nof media coverage has\nbeen given to Mr Modi\u2019s\nrhetorical zingers for\nexample \u201cBC stands for\nbefore Congress, and AD\nstands for after Congress\u201d,\nwith the Times of India\ndedicating their front page\nto it. Some things truly are\ninternational.\nIn the past, the Indian\nelectorate has fallen\nvictim to identity politics\nand voting for leaders\nbased on religion, caste,\nlanguage and ethnicity.\nHowever, time and time\nagain, Indian voters\nhave also demonstrated\ntheir ruthlessness against\nincumbents who failed to\nmeet their promises.

    "content": "ISSUE 1713\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\nCultist Simulator devs come to Imperial for ICSF\nconvention, Picocon\nCultist Simulator is a triumph and Weather Factory is a studio worth keeping tabs on!\nGAMES\nHarry Black\nGames Writer\nC\nultist Simulator,\nas you can guess\nfrom the name,\nis an indie game\ndesigned to simulate\ncreating and running a\ncult, which was released\nby Weather Factory on\n31st\nMay 2018. This is all\nI knew when I opened the\ngame for the first time to\nlive-tweet a playthrough.\nIt\u2019s been two weeks since\nthen and I have somehow\nlogged another 60 hours.\nCultist Simulator is a truly\nbrilliant, and incredibly\ncomplex, game!\nThe biggest flaw I\ncould argue there is within\nthe game is purely how\ncomplex it is \u2013 and that\nit makes no attempt to\nhold your hand. For this\nreason, I\u2019d advise against\ngoing into the game\nknowing as little as I did\n\u2013 you will enjoy the game\nmuch more if you go into\nthe game with at least a\nvague idea of what the\ngameplay pattern is and\nhow to progress towards\nvictory. However, the\ncomplexity of this game is\nalso its strongest feature.\nCultist Simulator is a\nreal passion project from\nWeather Factory, which\nis evident in the attention\nto detail and sheer depth\navailable \u2013 after 62 hours I\ndon\u2019t think I\u2019m anywhere\nclose to scratching the\nsurface of what this game\nhas to offer, and I\u2019ve\ncertainly not managed to\nbeat the game yet (though\nI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve been\nclose). Not to mention\nthat the game is still\nbeing tweaked and in the\nprocess of having additional content added \u2013 the\ncreators can\u2019t seem to get\nenough of it either!\nThe atmosphere in\nthe game is perfect \u2013 the\naesthetics and soundtrack\ncombine beautifully to\ncreate a strong sense of\nimmersion. The music\nreminds me a surprising\namount of Jeff Wayne\u2019s\nWar of the Worlds album,\nif that album were to be\ntransposed to be about\nthe occult rather than\nthe alien. I have found\nmyself a couple of times\ndawdling on the title\nscreen for 15-20 minutes\nat a time before actually\nstarting a run of the\ngame so I can listen to\nthe music without the\ngameplay loop drawing\nmy attention. When you\nconsider that all storytelling & advancement is\ndone purely via text, it is\nincredible that the game\nhas an atmosphere at all,\n\u201cAfter 62 hours\nI don\u2019t think\nI\u2019m anywhere\nclose to\nscratching\nthe surface of\nwhat this game\nhas to offer\u201d\n\u201cAlexis\nKennedy and\nLottie Bevan\nare two of the\nwonderful\nGuests of\nHonour for the\n36th\nPicocon\non the 16th\nFebruary\u201d\nlet alone one that seems\nto perfectly conjure up its\nLovecraftian inspirations.\nThe gameplay itself\nlooks rather simple \u2013 you\nhave four main resources\nyou need to manage,\nincluding your money;\ngoing broke will cause\nyou to fall ill or die. The\nmore different actions you\ntry, the more \u2018cards\u2019you\u2019ll\nhave to experiment with.\nThese cards can represent\nanything from places,\nto occult objects, to\nmembers of your cult, or\neven the police detective\ntrying desperately to find\nthe right evidence to shut\ndown your cult. You\u2019d be\nforgiven for thinking the\ngameplay was simplistic\nat first: click on a \u2018box\u2019\nlabelled something like\nwork, give it a card that\nit would make sense to\ndo work with, wait a\nshort period of time and\nbe told what the outcome\nwas. Even this system\nis much more complex\nthan it appears to begin\nwith \u2013 different card combinations can massively\nchange your outcomes,\nand some events occur\npart way through the\nduration, allowing you to\nadd other cards into the\nbox as well and so alter\nthe result.\nI cannot overstate how\nmuch I recommend this\ngame \u2013 if any part of it\nat all seems like it may\ninterest you, read up\non it a little or watch a\ncouple of YouTube videos\nbefore taking the plunge.\nI promise it\u2019ll be worth\nyour time. There is a\nquote from an anonymous\nfan on Weather Factory\u2019s\nwebsite that I rather like:\n\u201cHow to tell if you\u2019re in\nan Alexis Kennedy story:\nThere is no right choice.\nThere is no wrong choice.\nThere is only living with\nwhat you\u2019ve done\u2026\u201d\nand Cultist Simulator\nonce again embodies this\nHave you ever had the desire to start your own cult? Well here you go! // Weather Factory\n\u201cIn an Alexis\nKennedy story:\nThere is no\nright choice.\nThere is no\nwrong choice.\nThere is only\nliving with\nwhat you\u2019ve\ndone\u2026\u201d\nfeeling. (Alexis Kennedy\nis one of the two founding\nmembers of Weather\nFactory, alongside Lottie\nBevan.)\nIf you are at all intrigued by the narratives\nweaved within this game,\nor the visuals, or in fact\nanything at all that this\ngame has to offer (and\nyou should be), then you\nwill be thrilled to hear\nthat not just one but both\nof the founding members\nof Weather Factory are\ncoming to Imperial for\na talk! Alexis Kennedy\nand Lottie Bevan are two\nof our wonderful Guests\nof Honour for the 36th\nPicocon on the 16th\nof\nFebruary, and considering\nthe theme this year is\n\u2018Intrigue\u2019, it would be\npure folly to miss their\njoint talk!\nThis talk and those of\nour three other Guests of\nHonour, each a fantastic\nscience-fiction author,\nwill take place on 16th\nin\nBlackett\u2019s Lecture Theatre\n1, as well as many other\nIntriguing (please forgive\nme, but I\u2019ve been told I\nneed to work more puns\ninto our Picocon public-ity) events \u2013 including\nthe perennial Destruction\nof Dodgy Merchandise,\nwhich involves smashing\nodd bits of pop-culture\nwith liquid nitrogen and\na hammer. If any of these\nthings interest you at all\nthen please grab yourself\na ticket from the Union\nstore! I hope to see as\nmany of you there on the\nday as possible.\n\n"

In\nwearing our art, and conveying powerful messag-es, we encourage people\nto explore and challenge\ntheir own beliefs and\nestablished cultural atti-tudes.\nWe see modern trends\nand behaviours towards\nconscious fashion. People\nare becoming deeply\naware and selective of the\nclothes they choose and\nthe brands they represent.\nThis is because a brand has\nbecome much more than a\nlogo \u2013 it is a community of\nhuman beings with shared\nideals, behaviours and\nlifestyles.

We used fabric\npens to create this design\nas they unequivocally\nallow us to explore what\nhuman beings can achieve\nwith the simple marker\npen. The design is reminiscent of youthful art and\ndoodling \u2013 the shading of\nthe margins and borders in\nthe vibrant red is consistent with this. Meanwhile,\nthe bold, almost cartoon\nstyle typeface for the\nbranding is intelligent in\nconveying the message of\nunderstanding, like a child\nat school learns to understand the world around\nthem, we encourage you\nto understand Ins\u0101n.

We have\nused the silhouettes of the\ndancing spirits in our tees\nto create a psychedelic\nmasterpiece that promotes\nunity, oneness and un-derstanding. The image\nof dancing is iconic in\nthe sense that it comes to\nthe core basics of human\nunderstanding. Through\ndance, music and laughter,\nwe connect and we under-stand; it is precisely these\nfeelings that are captured\nin this tee.\nWe used the technique of spraying due\nto its anti-establishment\nconnotations.

Fashion\u2019s\ncurrent narrative is a dou-ble-edged sword. We are\nsurrounded by fashion that\nis spearheaded by cheap,\nfast trends and fluctuation\nor fashion that is intelligent in its conception and\ncampaigns, but comes\nattached to unachievable\nprices. Ins\u0101n will make\nhigh fashion accessible,\nit will make wearing\nsomething meaningful\nand beautiful achievable.\nWe will be a brand that\ngenerates conversation,\ntackles wrongful norms\nand challenges what you\nalready know.\nThe final design we\nwill explore is the \u2018Immigrant tee\u2019. This tee is\nvery special to us as it\nwas the spark that led to\nthe conception of Ins\u0101n.\nOur aim was to tackle the\nissues surrounding integration of immigrants into\nBritish society. We were\nstruck by the negative\nnarratives used to present\nimmigrants in the media.\nConversations surrounding \"British values\" and\nimmigrants incensed us\nand cultivated a desire to\nchallenge these accepted\nand omnipresent beliefs.\nWe thought, \"why not\nflip this on its head and\nchallenge people for not\ntaking the effort to understand the immigrants\nthemselves, not taking the\nsteps to connect with them\nas humans and understand\ntheir cultures and beliefs?\"\nThe stamp like \u2018Immigrant\u2019 print on the\nback of the t-shirt give a\nblatant and unapologetic\napproach to the situation\nand works to bring attention to the concept. Whilst\nthe simplistic Arabic on\nthe front contrasts this.\nThe Arabic depicts the\nword \u201cbushri\u201d \u2013 another\nword for \u2018human\u2019 but\nusing a different dialect\nof Arabic. The reason\nfor this is clear \u2013 black\nArabic writing on a white\nbackground carries a vast\narray of negative connotations in the media and this\nspecific combination has\nbeen used as a medium\nof scaremongering and\nfear-generation in both\nthe West and the East.\nWe wanted to reclaim\nthis, reclaim Arabic for\nthe beautiful and encompassing language it is\nand encourage people to\nunderstand immigrants\nand people in general for\nwho they really are. See\nbeyond the surface.\nWhat does it mean to\nIns\u0101n // Ryan Myers\nA creative house // Ryan Myers\nRestructuring fashion narratives // Ryan Myers\n\u201cWe not only\nshine light\non the issues\nthemselves,\nbut explore\nmentalities\nand\napproaches to\ntackle these\nissues\u201d\nMadmen graphic jeans //\nRyan Myers\nWe are acutely aware of\nthe problems the human\nrace face in modern climates \u2013 from issues surrounding the integration\nof immigrants, the dissociation and separation\nideologies that infiltrate\nmodern politics and the\nconcepts surrounding\nreligious integration\nand acceptance within\ncommunities. Ins\u0101n aims\nto present these issues\nthrough fashion. We not\nonly shine light on the\nissues themselves, but\nexplore mentalities and\napproaches to tackle these\nissues.\n\u201cWe are\nsurrounded by\nfashion that is\nspearheaded\nby cheap,\nfast trends or\nfashion that\nis intelligent,\nbut comes\nattached to\nunachievable\nprices \u201d\nwe have chosen to do so.\nTo be part of Ins\u0101n means\nto be part of a collective\nthat loves and supports\nthe desire to understand\npeople. We want to eradicate judgment, we want\nto encourage unity and we\nwant to develop networks\nbetween individuals from\nanywhere and every-where. This involves\nlistening to you - as\nfellow inhabitants of this\nworld, interacting with\nyour thoughts and beliefs\nand listening to what you\nwant a unifying fashion\nbrand to look like. Ins\u0101n\nis for the conscious and\nthe active.

Our DMs are\nalways open for sugges-tions, criticisms, love and\nsupport so please tell us\nwhat you think and help\nthe name \u2013 and what\ndoes it mean?\nThe name \u2018Ins\u0101n\u2019 is a\nphonetic depiction of the\nArabic word meaning\nhuman. The reason we\npickedthenameisbecause\nwe wanted to create\nsomething that was true\nto our message and true\nto our roots. The name, in\nits conception, highlights\none of the profound\ndifficulties that we aim to\nchallenge. Whilst in the\nmother-tongue the word\n\u2018ins\u0101n\u2019 means human, the\nphonetic is very close to\nthe word \u2018insane\u2019 \u2013 which\ndepicts madness. In this\nparadigm we present an\ninteresting narrative -do we take the time to\nunderstand someone for\nthe human being they\nare, including their roots\nand their beauty? Or do\nwe take the surface-level\nunderstanding and see\nsomeone who is different,\nwho is strange and who\nis \u2018mad\u2019 in their practices\nand beliefs? Do we treat\neach other like madmen,\nor embrace each other as\nmandem?\nOur first line\nIns\u0101n\u2019s first line is one\nof deep exploration and\nus to create something\nbeautiful.\nEmail \u2013 insan.\nmadmen@gmail.com\nbe part of the Insan\nfamily?\nIns\u0101n \u2013 encouraging\npeople to be a bit more\nhuman.\nWe foster creativity, we\nnurture inquisition and\nwe develop links between\nhumans.

    "content": "What next for Science in a No-Deal Brexit\nSCIENCE\nEyad Abuelgasim\nScience Editor\nO\nn 14th\nJune\n2016, just\nover a week\nbefore the EU\nreferendum, an open\nletter, signed by thirteen\nVote Leave ministers,\nwas published to calm the\nfears of British scientists,\nfarmers and others who\nrelied on European funds.\nIt pledged: \u201cIf the public\nvotes to leave on 23rd\nJune, we will continue to\nfund EU programmes in\nthe UK until 2020.\u201d One\nof the thirteen signatories\nwas Dominic Raab.\nHowever, Scientists\nwere quick to point out\nthe irony of one of the first\nthings Dominic Raab did\nas the newly-appointed\nBrexit Secretary. On 21st\nJuly 2018, he suggested\nthat the UK might not\nhonour the hard-wrangled\nwithdrawal agreement\nthat guarantees continued\nfunding of EU programmes until 2020.\nOn 15th\nJanuary 2019,\nParliament roundly\nrejected May\u2019s deal with\nthe European Union,\nwhich lays out the terms\nfor an orderly withdrawal.\nThis historic defeat for\nU.K. Prime Minister\nTheresa May makes the\nprospect of crashing out\nof the EU without a deal\nmore likely.\nOn Tuesday 5th\nFebruary, the Campaign\nfor Science and Enginerring, CaSE, published\nits evidence to the House\nof Commons Science &\nTechnology Committee\ninquiry into the implications of a no-deal Brexit\nfor science and engineer-ing.\nTo date, the UK has\nsecured over \u20ac5.1bn of\nEU Horizon 2020 funding\nsince the inception of the\nprogramme in 2014, the\nsecond largest recipient of\nfunding.\nA no-deal Brexit\nwould mean UK institutions would no longer\nbe eligible for three\nHorizon 2020 funding\nlines: European Research\nCouncil (ERC) grants,\nMarie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie\nactions (MSCA), and\nSME instrument (SMEi)\ngrants for small innovative businesses.\nThis would be a huge\nblow for UK science and\ninnovation.

Whether it\u2019s the\npretentious designers\nselling a branded\nbrick for a tonne of money,\nor the gormless idiots that\nbuy it, everything in the\nfashion world is designed\nto piss me off. Apparently,\nhowever, it is one of the\nthings many people at\nImperial enjoy and have\na serious interest in, so as\nalways, allow me to lower\nmy trousers, unclench my\narse cheeks and defecate\nall over your vacuous\nhobby.\nTo begin with, I deeply\nmistrust an art form that\nmostly involves watching\nhow fabrics hang off malnourished human bodies.\nHats off to the generations\nof fashion designers that\nhave successfully brainwashed young people into\nanorexia and unhealthy\nbody images. You are\nprobably responsible for\nso many mental health\nissues and eating disorders that I would applaud,\nexcept I\u2019m busy ramming\ncotton wool down my\nthroat. Delicious.\nI hasten to point out that\nas an industry, the suffering fashion imposes on its\nmodels is hardly the worst\nbit. The poor bastards that\nare employed to create\nthe clothes that you enjoy,\nand I wear because nudity\nis illegal, get to enjoy\nhighly unsafe working\nconditions coupled with\nbeing children. Who\nneeds education when you\ncan be crushed to death in\na factory collapse? Certainly not me. However,\nthat is the unfortunate\nnature of the industry,\nto produce vast amounts\ncheap rubbish and\nunderpay their workers\nbefore slapping a big fat\nbrand price increase. I\u2019m\nnot sure what reveals\nmore about human nature,\nmuch flammable crap that\nevery so often, they have\nto burn millions of pounds\nworth of product just so\nthey can keep selling it for\nextortionate amounts of\nmoney.\nThe funny thing is\nthat people will continue\nto buy this shit. In an\neffort to live the brand\n\u201clifestyle\u201d and flex over\nall their friends, middle\nclass cunts will continue\nto invest in this clothing.\nWhat a waste of human\nlife.\nthe fact that people think\nthey can do this or the fact\nthat people buy the damn\nthings anyway.\nHigh fashion certainly\nexhibits this in spades,\nwith the delightful high\nheeled crocs by Balenciaga costing an entirely\nreasonable $500 a pop,\nor the aforementioned\nSupreme brick. One of the\nmethods that these companies use to keep their\nprices high is destruction\nof unsold stock. Burberry\nfamously produces so\n\n"
