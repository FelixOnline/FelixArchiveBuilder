In the new surroundings,\nthe large number there were not so obvious since for once everybody, apart\nfrom I.C.U. President, found seats.\nEDWARDS LOSES CONTROL\nRHODESIAN DEBATE*.\nNOVEMBER 25th This was the biggest meeting the\nDebating Society has had for a long\ntime\u2014an audience of 200 being pre-sent. Unfortunately it was spoilt by\nmuch over-emotion rt rhetoric and by\ncontinuous il-maun cr:1 heckling\nwhenever anyone supported the motion\u2014which the chairman seem in-cao able of quelling, only calling for\norder twice.\ni ne main argument, of Patric Wall\nproposing that \" this house would riot\nsu port further coercive action against\nMr. Smith's Government\" was that because of the intransigence of South\nAfrica and Portugal, any economic\nsanctions are fore doomed to dis-aster. T. ie only logical sanction, the\nuse of force, would involve not only\nbattle but full scale war, and Britain\nhad no right to instigate this.\nDavil Ennals presented his case\nlogically and un emotionally to a very\ntense audience. He emphasised the\npolitical repercussions of a policy of\nno further involvement, such as the\npossible break up of the Commonweath, and reiterated the need for imposition of oil sanctions. Roger Lee,\nat times inaudible from the constant\nhissing and booing, gave a badly delivered but sound speech, handicapped\nby a Rhodesian a cent. The floor produced some noteworthy speeches, especially from Mr. Anand and Mr. Lisman.\nThe motion was defeated by 144\nvotes to 29, with about 15 abstentions.\nAfter - the - Gala evening we aT show in the \" Haute Boutique\nFlcatique\" fashion parade\nImperial College g^f^ y c Society\npresents\nThe\nFire\nby Ma Imperial O710 Decei\n7.45\nTo Business Manager, Dramsoc,\nc/o Union Letter Rack.\nPlease send me tickets\nat\nfor the performances on\n.Name\nDept.\nYear\nEMERGENCY\nCALL O. SS.\nA_N EMERGENCY task force\nto aid in cases of sudden eviction is one of the ideas envisaged\nby Arthur Francis to help the\nNotting Hill Housing problem.\nMr. Francis is now engaged in\nforming a society to help with any\nsocial work necessary locally. There\nis, he feels, a genuine need for such\na society since all the voluntary social\nwork is done at present by the religious societies. No scope is afforded\nthe person who wishes to help in social work but does not wish to be\ninvolved with a religious body.\nThe principal function of this club\n\u2014tentatively named the Organisation\nfor Social Services\u2014would be to provide a link between the students in\nCollege and any social work that\nneeds to be done outside the College.\nA file of such work would be compiled and would extend as the organisation grew and was able to undertake more tasks.\nIn the immediate future O.S.S. is\nlikely to be mainly concerned with the\nNotting Hill Housing Trust\u2014removing the responsibility for organising\nre decoration parties, task forces and\npeople to aid by simply talking to\nthose in need from the Carnival Committee.\nTalks with officers of the religious\nsocieties and Huxley Society have met\nwith favourable response, and the\nclub is soon to be proposed to the\nSocial Clubs Committee.\nWHERE DID\nALL THE\nPEOPLE\nDY MID-WEEK, attendance at the\ntwo meetings already held in Population Control Week had been disappointing\u2014despite two excellent meet-in gs. Mr. Norman of the Centre for\nUrban Studies outlined lucidly the\nsize of the population disaster that is\ndescending upon us; this is what\npeople need: incontrovertible facts\nand figures.\nMr. Taylor of Oxfam showed us a moving film about work done by\nvoluntary workers in post-independence Algeria, followed by a detailed\ndiscussion of Oxfam's work.\nEvery year \u00a3300 million go out of\nthis country to help the developing\ncountries; half of this comes from the\nGovernment; of the rest, \u00a32 million\ncome from Oxfam, who also, pro-b ably, make the greatest contribution,\nthrough their advertising, to persuading the people of this country of the\nneed for Aid. There is a move afoot in this College for more social work to be out-side; Oxfam should be high on the\nlist of worthy causes.\nrt u yone interested in such social\n.vor k, whether just for the Carnival\nor all the year round, should contact\nArthur Francis at Room 26 Weeks\nHall or add their names to posters\nasking for helpers for Notting Hill.\nGRAHAM BOL CH.

    "content": "2 FELIX ARE\nYOU ~\nLIVING I\"T, IFE : Living or Existing\"\nwas the subject tor the\nICCD's first meeting in their\nseries \" Why Believe,\" on November 15th. Ed* Reis, from the USA society\n\" The Navigators,\" talked on this\nsubject, basing his arguments on the\npremise that people who are active\nChristians are living to the full; that\nonce a person becomes actively committed to Christ then his life completely changes, takes on a new\nmeaning and purpose, and has more\nsignificance.\nHe chose St. Paul as an example,\nsia ying th?:t before his cc \\ version,\nPaul had only lived in the sense of\nexisting; his life was unsatisfactory\nand purposeless; afterwards however,\nhe achieved a new goal in life and\nrealised the power of Christianity.\nUNJUSTIFIED ASSUMPTION\nMr. Reis, apart from the very\nfeeble jokes and the obvious meta-ph or s,( which seem to be an occupational hazard of many ICC U meet-in gs), had presented his argument\nclearly and logically.\nBut then he continued with the\nbasic assumption that everybody who\nwas not a Christian could not possibly\nbe as happy,\" or their life could not\nbe so meaningful, as it would were\nthey to become one. He did not\njustify this, but he proceeded to expand it to the point that the only way\nto achieve a state of grace is to\nbecome a Christian. The audience\naccepted this, without demurring, and\nproceeded to soak in the usual clich es and assertions which followed on for\nthe. next twenty minutes with obvious\nrelish, or else with complete boredom,\n(but with no stages of interest between\nthese extremes).\nThus the objectives cf the meeting,\nwhich was to inform an J interest\nnon-Christians, was not ache ved. MARTIN BELL FOREIGN AFFAIRS\nSelected by\nNORTHERN CENSORSHIP\nThe Newspaper of Rutherford\nCollege of Technology now refuses to name who produces it, or\nwhere it is produced in order to\navoid \" the indignity of censorship by College authorities.\"\nThe Editor claims that the authorities want to prevent unfavourable impressions of the College reaching outsiders.\n* * *\nHELPFUL MEN IN BLUE The police, often accused of\nbeing bad-tempered during student j olli fi cations, contributed\ngreatly to the celebrations at\nBristol concerning the Lord\nMayor's annual Grant to Wills\nHall, by coating the War Memorial\u2014a favourite object for\nclimbing, with black grease. This\nsort of action will have a far\nbetter effect than simply banning\nany such actions, and is less likely\nto lead to frayed tempers.\n\u2022 \u2022 *\nYET MORE LOSSES\nKing's Ui.lon have cancelled\ntwo dances this term as a result\nPaul Smitn\nof losing \u00a3280 on three held so\nfar.

As a preview to the new issue, Felix\ntalked to the Editor of Phoenix, Mervyn Jones.\nOn being asked what he thought the\naims of the magazine were, he replied:\n\" Phoenix was started in 1885 by H.G. Wells. Since then it has varied\nfrom being virtually a newspaper, reporting such things as deaths of members during the Great War, to the\nother extreme\u2014completely a literary\nmagazine.\n\" I believe that Phoenix should be\na mixture of these two extremes. It\nshould contain good literary contributions and it should also be used by\nstudents as a platform for airing their\nviews or ideas.\n\"At the moment the few people who\nactually think about the Union do not\nbother to write anything because they\ndo not reckon they are good enough.\n\\ believe that students should take an\ninterns in Phoenix, as it is the only\nCollege publication apart from Felix,\nand is therefore important.\"\nThe forthcoming issue of Phoenix contains articles on the Haldane Library,\nHalls of Residence, short stories, and\ntwo poems by Patric Dickinson, the\nfamous British poet, and visiting\nlecturer to I.C. Finally, Mervyn Jones pleaded for\nmore staff, and contributions for the\nissue coming out at the end of next\nterm.

Why do the University students\ninsist on wearing the worst clothes in London? Surely trousers with a crease must be\npreferable to those things called' jeans' with bulbous knees and sagging bottoms - can\nthere be any other establish u ent in England where the men of supposedly high intellect appear for work in such a manner. The polo-necked sweater (doesn't need washing so often[ dirty jacket and the shoes which last saw Cherry Blossom at their birth, seem to be\nthe universal marks of the student. Can it be wondered that other teenagers, not so\nfortunate, try to imitate their so called better s? Good clothes are expensive, but they wear and look so much better than their cheap counterparts, so you man of I.C. why not set an example to the rest of London's students, You're not even u rti sts so you can't use that excuse, you're meant to be the\nfuture top minds in science, ana surely a scientist should be orderly in body as well as in mind.\nIncident ly, some of the women students at this college should read this as well, a minority are as bad as the men,\nT JNI0N MESS.

Searle & Co., while obviously not designed for an audience of our intellectual distinction, was highly informative on the basic principle employed by such products as\nOv ul in. In these drugs the production of ova is inhibited by means of a large dose of\no estrogen; the menstrual cycle is otherwise maintained normal by prog est in s similar to those manufactured in the body, .len ce the pill can be used to regulate the periods;\ncramps and pre-menstrual tension also tend to disappear. The pill also seems to reduce\nthe incidence of cervical cancer in those women using it. As the other film showed, at\nleast one American doctor believes it reduces the incidence of Communism in poor count -ries using it. Nevertheless, the technique of taking pills on successive nights for three weeks\nat a time, seems to be too complicated to be useful in the developing world.

After ten long bleak years, during which throwers\nand jumpers seemed to be entirely the property of other colleges,\nand we were forced to rely on press-ganging unwilling \" track men \"\ninto service, such success seems like a dream.\nIn spite of the cold, wet and windy\nFISTICUFFS\nYY/ATER POLO has never had a reputation as a\" gentleman's sport,\" and I.C.s match against\nBirmingham University bore more\nresemblance to Putney tow-path on\nMorphy Day than a normal polo\nmatch.\nI.C. scored three excellent goals\nthrough their trio of Geoff Hook,,\nBarry Stapley and Ken Price. These\nhowever were insufficient to overcome\nthe handicap of having Stapley,\nShorty, Randall and Rowe sent off\nconditions turning the Mot spur Park\nground into a polar waste, there was\na complete college turn-out and th's, in addition to several fine individual\nperformances, was our winning factor.\nThe Tvalve trophy for field events\nworks on an \" aggregate\" points\nsystem, where the distance achieved by\neach competitor from a college is\nadded together to find the final college\nplacings. This means that it is essential to have two men entered for each\nevent for otherwise even the individual winner of an event can score no\npoints if he has no second string to\nback him up,\nFull Team\nBy ensuring that we had a full\nteam in each event, we managed to\ngain high points in most events : 1st place in the High Jump; 2nd in the Pole\nVault, Discus, Shot and Triple Jump\nand sufficient points in the remaining\nevents to take us to a3027 points\nvictory over the second place team\nGuy's Hospital.\nNear Thing\nIt was a neck and neck struggle between I.C. and Guy's all afternoon\nwith I.C. just leading by one point\neach time the overall scores were\nanounced, and only in the dying\nStages of the afternoon, as the rain\nbegan to pour down, did we draw\nahead with everything depending on\nthe result of the Triple Jump. Here\nChris Fowers and Paul Jones, fighting\nhard at the end of a strenuous afternoon after each had competed in several events, managed to stave off the\nGuy's challenge and bring us to vic-tory.\nVersatile\nMany of our athletes tried their\nhand at several events : Leon Hall\ntook one look at the high jump takeoff and stormed off in disgust to come\nsecond in the pole vault and Brian\nDexter gave fine service by coming\nsecond and third in the Discus an ij Shot. We we fs nowhere near so\nsuccesful in the relays' cup, which we\nhave held quite often in the past,\nwith a depleted team coming a dismal seventh.\nBadminton\nFall from Grace\nAFTER EASY VICTORIES against\nI.C,Q. M.C. and King's, we went\nconfidently to play the next best team\nin the League to us\u2014Goldsmiths.\nLast year's Captain, M. Fitzgerald,\nwho had only lost one league match\nfor I.C. in two years had an \" off-day \" and lost two of his matches.\nR. M.il ward and D. Fisher after being\n14-0 up against Goldsmith's first pair\nin the final game of the first match\nlost their grip and managed to lose.\nIn light of the foregoing, what chance\ndid we s'. and. We lost, 6-3! Our first\ndefeat for almost a year. Since then,\nhowever. Goldsmith's have been\nbeaten by King's and as our seconds\nbeat them at the beginning of the\nseason, we should still win the League\n(always assuming we beat our unbeaten second team.)\nIan Blair\nSportlight\nFROZEN FIXTURES\n'T 'HE NORTH WIND doth blow and we shall have snow,\" and so we did\u2014\nlots of it. Perhaps it did not last very long but it was enough to warn\nus that this looks like being a harsh, bitter winter. A winter that will\ntempt us all to any excuse to avoid so ending a Wednesday or Saturday\nafternoon shivering on a Harlington Pitch.\nThere will be matches cancelled; there will be pitches unfit; and there will be\na lot of people who suddenly discover they have an unprecedented amount\nof work to do, relatives to meet etc. No doubt the top teams can be\npersuaded to keep turning out through all the bad weather to come, but for\nthe lower ranks, who may possibly feel that their matches are not so\nimportant, it will be a different proposition.\nDon't Give Up\nBut if a sport is worth doing it is worth doing well\u2014and that means regularly.\nDuring the bad winter of '62-'63, even some of the gym games gave\nup because the gym was too cold. This year, should the weather be as\n\u2022 bad, let us hope that everyone will be brave and remember that everyone\nis needed from the 1st team to the 7th. Frank Hobson\nSoccer Report by Bob Grundy\nA MOODY WIN\nI.C.2 \u2014 Q.M. C.1ON WEDNESDAY, 17th November, I.C. travelled to Brentwood\nto play Q.M. C. in the Premier Division of the University League.\nDue to their previous record the visitors were not too confident of\ntheir chances. The conditions could not have been called ideal, thick\nmud covered most of the playing surface, which later on in the game\nw j>c* \u2022\u00bb \u2022n rn into a quagmire.\nStraight from the kick off pressure\nwas on the I.C. defence and early on\na shot from the QM C inside forward\nwas kicked off the line by Holmes\nwith Wojtowicz beaten. IC played\ngood football and managed to stave\noff these early shocks and indeed went\nclose on a number of occasions, Smart\nin particular going near with a twenty\nyard drive. Towards half time, IC\nplaying with the slope, were firmly in\ncharge cf the game, but they could not\ntake the lead.\nbeaten all the way\nTwo minutes after the interval\nQM C scored when a centre from the\nleft was headed in by the inside right,\nbeating Wojtowicz all the way.\nIt was very pleasing however to see\nthe IC Team fighting back after this\nsetback, and they set up attack after\nattack, going close to scoring on a number of occasions. It came as no\nsurprise when Eastall scored the\nequalise r; after receiving the ball\nsquare on the edge of the area he\nsent the ball rocketing into the top\ncorner leaving the keeper helpless.\nhasty measures\nThe game was now developing into\na battle, more against the conditions\nthan anything else. Both teams were\nstriving hard for the winning goal,\nand the defences had to resort to\nhasty clearances time and ime again.\nIC at last got their second goal when\nHopwood although harassed by two\ndefenders crashed the ball into the\ncorner of the net. Although QM C piled everything into a final bid for\nthe equalizer, the IC defence held out\nto the end.\nThis against the form win for IC\nwas very heartening, particularly\nwith the team coming from behind.\nby the referee. In a brave effort to\nrestore the balance Rowe even\nmanaged to get sent off a second time\nbut it was all in vain and we lost by\nfour goals to three.\nKnock-out Cup\nLast Friday in the play-off of the\nU.L. Cup I.C. won through to the\nfinal. On the way there both the 1st and 2nd team defeated Q.M. C.6 \u20140\nto reach the semi-final. In the semifinal I.C.I and I.C. II were drawn\nagainst each other with the 1st coming\nhome 4\u20142 after a close struggle.\nAnd so on to the final for the fifth\nyear running. Our opponents U.C. took a very early lead but owing to\npoor shooting by I.C. the equalise r did\nnot corne until 20 sees, before the end\nthrough a goal by Randall. The\ngame went into extra time when U.C. scored to take the cup 2\u20141.\nSquash\nON THECAM\nTHE ANNUAL pilgrimage of two IC\nsquash V's to one of the more provincial of Universities took place on\nthe week-end of the 20th,21 st November.\nThe party set off from the Union at\nthe civilised hour of 11.00 p.m. on\nSaturday morning. The first car\nmanaged to cross Hyde Park before\nbecoming lost. After driving right\nround Regents Park a couple of times,\nthe driver and navigator decided on a likely looking road and we resumed\nour journey in the general direction\nof Cambridge.\nThe cars arrived in time for lunch\nin various pubs and/or colleges. In the\nafternoon the 1st team played and\nwere just beaten by a strong Christ's College team 2-3. The 2nd fared\nbetter against the St. Catherine's first\nteam and managed to scrape a win 3-2.\nSunday Tea\nThe evening was spent drowning\nsorrows or celebrating victory until\nclosing time. The following morning\nwas spent similarly occupied till lun cn time. In the a tter noon the 1st team\nobtained a commendable win over\nQueen's College; 3-2. The second\nteam were not so fortunate being\nhammered 0-5 by a strong St. John s Team.\nAfter tea and crumpets, followed\nby ale, the two teams rejoined and set\noff for the bright lights of London\nagain. The journey was uneventful\napart from one of the cars nearly\nrunning to the other at some traffic\nlights.\nPete Combes\nRugby\nGUTTERIDGE CUP\nSIR JOHN CASS COLL. 0 \u2014 LC17 Last Friday in the play-off of the\nU.L. Cup I.C. won through to the\nfinal. On the way there both the 1st and 2nd team defeated Q.M. C.6 \u20140\nto reach the semi-final. In the semifinal I.C.I and I.C. II were drawn\nagainst each other with the 1st coming\nhome 4\u20142 after a close struggle.\nAnd so on to the final for the fifth\nyear running. Our opponents U.C. took, a very early lead but owing to\npoor shooting by I.C. the equalise r did\nnot come until 20 sees, before the end\nthrough a goal by Randall. The\ngame went into extra time when U.C. scored to take the cup 2\u20141.\nLast Wednesday at Chingford I.C. beat Cass by 5 tries and one conversion to nil in the 1st round of the\ncup.\nI.C. lost the toss and played down\nthe slope into a cold wind and a low\nbright sun. Two early LC. attacks\nnearly succeeded but Cass defences\nheld out.\nAs the first half ran out, it became\nobvious that Cass were at full stretch,\nbut also that I.C. could not click in\nattack.

    "content": "6 FELIX A Philosophy\nfor Life\nMR. SCHUMACHER, Economic Advisor\nand Director of Statistics at the National\nCoal Board,finished on Tuesday his series of\nsix lectures on how to apply the precepts of\nphilosophy as a guide* to living. He dealt\nwith convergent and divergent problems,\nshowing that not all divergent ones (i.e. non-scientific ones, not encountered in the\nlaboratory) were soluble, with the question\nof free will and causality and with many of\nthe important philosophical errors which\npeople tended to accept\nHis latest three lectures completed and drew\ntogether his argument into a logical whole and\nindicated how to translate philosophy into action.\nBefore formulating any precepts on a guide to\naction, there are three main prejudices to be\novercome : that of assuming superiority of intelligence over our ancestors\u2014an hypothesis easily\ndiscounted by a study of the great literature, art\nand science of the world. That of the superiority of\nthe white man over others, and that of religious\nprejudice and into ler nee.\nSelf Awareness\nA consideration ol the three greatest teachers\nin history, Buddha, Christ and Mohammed, will\nshow that all, in effect, basically say the same\nthing; that man must become \"Awake,\" must\nachieve self-awareness. The idea i of Buddha was\nto achieve \" enlightenment,' Nirvana; Christ was\nalways giving warnings of the danger of \" falling\nasleep into temptation,\" and many passages in the\nKoran compare sinners to \" sleepers ,na prison\n. . . \" This idea is also followed by many primitive\ntribes and is found in most western philosophy :\n(Dante's Divine Comedy :\u2014\" In the middle of the\nroad of life I woke up\u2014.\") Man must free himself from his hampering passions, from his own\nlikes and dislikes, and become aware of his pos i tion in the world. Between the dialectical extremes\nof attachment and detachment there is the \" middle\nway,\" non-attachment. St. Thomas Aquinas\nechoed these ideas when he said that ali w of\npleasure is subhuman. \" Pleasure is not w, ong,\nbut the pursuit of pleasure as a diversion is wrong.\nIt arises natural.\" Plato wrote that the two virtues of man were (a)\" prudent sia \"\u2014i.e. self-awareness, (b)\" sole rti a \"\u2014objectivity in the face\nof unexpected events. All systems which realize\nthe goal of self-awareness also agree that the way\nto achieve this is to tackle one's mind:\" All that we are is the result of what we have thought,\"\nsaid he Buddha, and again \" Vigilance is the path.\nThoughtlesness is the path to death.\"\nMorality\nBefore finding a basis for action, then, we must\nfirst find self-awareness, or \"wisdom.\" To live\nin this state of consciousness we must liberate\nourselves from our likes and dislikes, and achieve\nfreedom of intellect. The intellect, and hence\nmorality, must be sovereign in our lives\u2014this\nagain is a common precept of all great religions.\nFor instance, the noble eight-fold path, in Buddhist\nteaching, is Right Understanding and Right Aims,\n(awareness), Right Speech, Action and Livelihood\n(morality), Right Effort, Mindfulness and Concentration (\" mind-training \").\nMan may be thought of in two separate ways :\n1. \" Homo Sapiens,\" a zoological description of\nman. This method says that man is simply a cosmic accident in the. process of evolution. In\nsome philosophies this is raised to a religion\u2014\na basically erroneous step; because a hypothesis\nfits certain facts, this does not mean that the hypothesis is the absolute scientific truth, or even that\nthe hypothesis is correct. It says that there was no\nintelligence behind his creation\u2014it just happened,\ndue to the operation of immutable mechanical\nprocesses.\n2. \" Homo Viator \"\u2014man, the pilgrim. The homo\nvi at or says that it is impossible for man to be\ncreated by an accident in a few thousand million\nyears\u2014the probability of it occurring is too low.\nHe feels \"something has created him from chaos.\"\nBoth systems start with an un explain able enigma,\n\u2022f; creation or formation of man. Under these\ntwo headings can be grouped all philosophies and\nreligions, and all methods of living.\nFreedom\nThe inevitable and unavoidable inference from\nconsidering the \" Homo Sapiens\" approach is\nthat man has no freedom; everything is determined by physical and chemical processes, because\nthis is being proved by science. But the other\nsystem assumes that man is endowed with the\npower of potential freedom\u2014this is justifiable,\nsince the scientific method precludes the existence\nof freedom, it is unobservable by science. In\nKierkegaard's words, \" Omnipotence cannot only\nbring forth the most imposing of all things, the\nworld in all its totality, but can also bring forth\nthe most delicate of all things, a creature that is\nfree of the world.\" Potential freedom in one's life is affirmed by Nietsche, Sartre, and other\nExistentialist thinkers, and is a recurring theme\nin most religions\u2014man has the freedom of choice.\nSystems in which man is a biological phenomenon only deny the existence of any existential\nmeaning in life. Life has no purpose, no meaning,\nis absurd, says much modern philosophy (Camus,\nHegel, Sartre.) Kierkegaard was confronted with\nthis problem of meaningless ness, but unable to\noffer any consolation, he could only confirm the\ndiagnoses. \" One sticks one's finger into the soil\nto tell by the sr nell what land one is in; I stick\nmy finger into existence\u2014it smells of \"nothing.\nWhere am I? Who am I? How did I come to\nbe here? What is this thing called the world?\nWhat does the world mean ? Who is it that has\nlured me into the thing, and now leaves me there?\n. . . How did I come into the world? Why was\nJL not consulted, why was I not made acquainted\nwith its manners and customs, but was thrust\ninto its ranks as though I'd been bought from a kidnapper, a dealer in souls? How did I obtain an\ninterest in it? Where is the Director? I would\nlike to see him.\" Evolution is assumed to be\ntaking mankind (a collective term) higher and\nhigher. But presumably one does not bother\nabout the majority who will fall by the wayside.\nMan has no task in life, but everything is previously determined and programmed by scientific\nprinciples.\nArt and Individuality\nThe homo vi at or considers that man is a\" pupil\nin the school of life,\" to use a sanctimonious\nphrase. He must use his freedom to fit in with\nthe universe as a whole, and his task is set by the\n\" Director of the enterprise \" (Kierkegaard). One\ncan teach optics to a blind man (manipulative\nknowledge), but this is a very different from a knowledge of LIGHT. Science trains us highly\nin manipulative knowledge, to solve convergent\nproblems, but divergent problems cannot be\nsolved by such knowledge. Others are regarded\nsimply as physical necessities for self-preservation,\nby homo sapiens, but the homo vi at or says that\nunless one lives in a certain way one is debarred\nfrom understanding the things worth understand-ing. The two systems lead to completely different\nmodes of living and thinking (in one case, art, for\ninstance, would be regarded as an intimation\nassisting towards self-awareness, but in the other\ncase, art is propaganda or entertainment). One\ncannot be agnostic, for this is simply subscribing\nto \" Homo Sapiens,\" but must decide which course\nto follow. Both philosophical systems agree that\nman must develop his individuality, (c.f.\" The\nLonely Crowd,\" by Reesman) but if one views\nman as \" Homo Viator,\" one must progress further.\nTo achieve \" meta noi a\"( self-awareness) and then\n\" rebirth,\" or to live in a\" state' of inspiration,\"\nis the goal.\nPeople judge themselves by their intentions, and\nother people by actions, but if this process were\nreversed, many problems of community life would\nbe solved. We would also live existentially, and\ndiscover freedom and responsibility. Whatever\nobjections one had against Mr. Schumacher's method of philosophy, one could have nothing\nbut admiration for the lucid way in which it was\npresented. So often, philosophy is wrapped up\nin obscure mum bo jumbo, tut here at least one\nhad the satisfaction of understanding and digesting\nthe choices and arguments presented.\nMARTIN BELL Poll on\nPresident\nIgnorance Revealed\n\\S THE AVERAGE I.C. student well\nenough informed on the running of the\nUnion to be able to choose wisely a Union\nPresident ?\nKanta Polls investigated this question by asking\napproximately two hundred members of the College including some Freshers, the following three\nquestions:\u2014\n1. What do you think the main function of the\nPresident of ICU is ?\n2. Who is responsible for the basic financial\npolicy of the Union ?\n3. How many people sit on Council ?\nA summary of the result is given below.\nQu. 1\u2014\nper cent\nDon't know 28\nStudent representative 20\nPublic figure 13\nAdministrator 10\nIn answer to the first question, the largest percentage (28 per cent) of the people simply did not\nknow what the main function of the President of\nICU is, or even should be, and 29 per cent had\nonly a vague idea.\nWhen asked what he thought the job of the\nPresident should be, Adrian Fletcher, President of\nICU, said that it would'vary from President to\nPresident, but it should be concerned mainly with\nbeing one of the following : an administrator, afi eure head, a student representative to I.C. authorities or to other Colleges and Universities.\nTwenty-five per cent of those interviewed admitted they did not know the. answer to question\ntwo ; 30 per cent gave the correct answer\u2014Council. This shows a distinct lack of interest in the\nfinancial affairs of the Union.\nLastly, the majority of students (75 per cent)\nthought Council to be smaller, and therefore less\nrepresentative, than it really is. Eighty per cent\nof those asked could not get within plus or minus\nfive of the correct number, 26, their answers very-ing from 4 to 40.\nFrom the results it can be inferred that the\nmajority of the members of this College are uninformed or mis-informed on the running and set-up\nof the Union.\nR.J.

If this is go, then the election of the British\nPrime Minister, too, does not belong to a democracy.\nCouncil may be likened to an outdated British Constitution, where certain\nconstituencies are represented by more than one MP, and some electors\nhave more than one vote. For instance, your vote may be used to elect\na Deputy President, three representatives from IC Union, are pre se native from a constituent college, and one or more Committee Chairmen.\nAll but the first Deputy President and ICU representatives on Council are\nchosen by a closed vote; only RCS men have the franchise for RCS President and their representative on Council, only Chairmen of Social\nclubs elect their Committee Chairman (they are in turn elected by the\nmembers of their clubs).\nWhy should the closed vote for President, therefore, be discarded? A particularly able person is needed to take on the position. By the present system\nthe candidate (there is rarely more than one) has, generally, spent a year as\nunderstudy, observing how Council operates and discovering all that the\nPresidency involves. The President-elect is thus able to take over the\nresponsibility immediately, and does not need the summer term \" training\nperiod \" prevalent in so many other college democracies.\nHow well do other Free Votes in the College work? The easiest parallels are\nto be drawn from the constituent colleges, and from those elections from\nthe ICU Annual General Meeting. It appears to be a general rule that the\nmore the responsibility carried by any post, then the fewer are its\ncontestants. This year's Deputy President, Chris Molam, was unopposed;\ns6t po were the Presidents of Mines and Guilds. Futhermore, they were\nput up for their posts by their predecessors, and thus well-briefed on what\nlay ahead.\nOne of the arguments against Council's election of the President may be\nsummed up in that dreaded word \" clique.\" The open votes appear to\nsuffer from that other dreaded utterance \"apathy.\" The question now\nbecomes one of \"what's the difference?\"\nWhichever system of voting for the President is adopted only those who are\nreally interested in the running of the Union will take the trouble to\nimpress their views on the matter. Now they have to find their way on\nto Council or lobby present members of Council. Soon, perhaps, they\nmay merely have to record their crosses on a piece of paper.\nOn balance I hope that the open vote does tip the scales, if only so that\ndemocracy may be \" seen \" to be carried out in IC Union. If tomorrow\nthe general members of the Union do gain the chance to vote directly for\ntheir President, we all must beware of any cheapening of the elections\nb v untidy wall-daubing s, emotional bombast or other adverse reflections.\nKeep out of the rut\nfor just another year\nand help in a developing: country\nVSO needs 900 graduates and\nprofessionally qualified volunteers\nfor next September\nConsult your Appointments Board or write to\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS\n3 HANOVER STREET LONDON W1A PLACE TO GO\nAST WEEK I WAS unlucky enough to find myself in Malet Street one\n' night about ten. Being a conscientious student, I ventured into the\nmausoleum on the corner, laughingly called a university union. In\ndesperate need of relief, I first tested their facilities an level one and\nfound them entirely satisfactory. Returning to the throngs in the passage\nways, I followed a sign to the bar, which I must admit was pretty lively ;\npeople drinking heartily, and being ever so careful not to drop ash on the\nfloor. Attempts to buy a drink, however, proved absolutely fruitless,\nbecause it was 10.02 by the clock and I was told \" Bar closes at ten, Sir.\"\nTEN. I could hardly believe it, but all efforts to get a drink met with the\nsame reply. Dejectedly, I went down again to the ground floor, and\npicking my way 'trough the crowds of people all wearing patriotic red\nwhite and blues scarves. I reached the front door. \" Union closes 10.30 \"\nsaid the enamel plaque. This was the last straw; I went and was last\nseen in the \" Intrepid Fox \" in Wardour Street, which closes at eleven,\nthank you very much. It is hardly surprising the place is so empty, the\nwelcome is overwhelming to the point of embarrassment. Perhaps if they\nrearranged the name to \"University lu,\" it would get more support.\nADVERTISING\nCOME THING WHICH THIS College can be proud of, is the quality of its\n*-* advertising. One has only to look around to see rows of imaginative\nartistic posters luring the unwary away from work. The free availability\nof photo-copies has enabled the various publicity men to spend more\ntime on design, and a lot less on construction. Although the College\nUnions and R.C.S. Carnival have produced the more obvious material,\nit is noticeable that many more' of the smaller clubs are producing high\nquality advertisements for their meetings. The Religious and allied\nSocieties have a prodigious output, especial y the stripe of fluorescence\nasking, \" Why believe?\" This improvement is not only aesthetically\npleasing, but should increase the support for a wider- range of union\nactivity. If it does not, the publicity officers certainly cannot be blamed.\nYOU\nV V7H AT DID YOU DO to support Population Control Week? Quite a lot,\njudging by the remarkable decrease in the number of women at Sunday\nbreakfast. That's the spirit, keep it up, lads.\nWAY OF THE WORLD\nJ REJOICE to hear that Guilds are\nmaking progress with their new,\nBowdlerised Freshers' Dinners; any\nbreach in the wall of heartiness, any\ntriumph for a seemly prudish ness is\ndear to my heart. One day, I hope to\nsee them included in General Studies\nwith urbane, cultivated Mr. Mc Dovetail sitting discreetly near the\nback, puffing paternally, and ple b by, ignorant Hai Bowells reading (though\nwith difficulty) from \" Party Jokes foi\nToddlers,\" and the elegant, sophisticated women all tittering coy fy.

The motion springs from a suggestion that loans should be introduced\nin a letter from the Department of\nEducation and Science that found its\nway to the national press in early\nOctober. The problem its creates immediately is whether it was intended\nas bluff or as a feeler prior to some\ndefinite action. However, it probably\nheralds a hardening of attitude towards increase in student grants.\nIn view of the element of doubt,\nMr. Cavanagh \"feels that, like NUS, ICU should act as though it is a serious consideration.\nGUILDS DINNERS\n'SUCCESS'\nTHE MAIN OBJECT of the Guilds\nFreshers Dinners this year was to\ngive an opportunity to the fresher s to\nget to know a few members of their\nstaff and vice versa. The assemblages\nwere more subdued and refined than\nlast year, each dinner taking the form\nof a three course meal including wine,\nwith beer to follow in the company\nof various guests from the department\nconcerned.\nThe opinions of the heads of the\nEUROPEAN SEMINAR\nJ) ELEGATIONS from nineteen European Countries have been\ninvited to the European Student Seminar of Technological Education (ESSTE) to be conducted from 2nd \u20148th January, 1966. This\nseminar was formed to draw a critical comparison between the teaching methods in various European scientific Institutions.\nThey will discuss a wide range of\ntopics from education in schools to\ntheir future positions in Industry.\nFrom this they hope to help the future\ndevelopment of scientific education in\nEurope.\nThe delegation from I.C. should\ninclude one person competed with\nunion affairs and one \" mature stu-dent.\" who will have to submit papers\non particular aspects of education at\nI.C., and they must be very familiar\nwith the details of education here.\nA Science Research Council grant\nof \u00a3600 has been given by the government towards the estimated expenditure of \u00a31750. Complete\" board and\nlodging will be provided at Manchester University, but travel to\nManchester will probably have to be\nmet by the delegates.\ndepartments, and other staff who had\nbeen present, were that the dinners\nhad been successful in their purpose\nand that they would probably be more\nsuccessful next year when more staff\ncould be persuaded to come along,\nMost of the students I talked to\nagreed that they had enjoyed the\nevenings and had found great value\nin talking to a few members of staff.\nSome students who had apparently\nnot managed to talk to any staff felt\nthat the dinner had been disappoint-ing. No doubt the traditional fresher s festivity would have suited them. But\nmost of the students, including members of the second, enjoyed themselves.\nHRtSS (it i if iT iii ccorp iii ii the London School nf_L cyn.> e it Marriage\n3 RETAIN has suffered a silent\nsocial revolution in the last\neighty years, in the institution\ncalled marriage. So said Professor O.R. McGregor to a General\nStudies meeting on Thursday,\n25th November.\nHe informed us that during the last\ncentury there we ri>25 per cent more\nwomen in our country than men. This\nhad lead to the suffragette movement\nand the eventual emancipation of\nwomen. Equality had helped to re-volution is e marriage.\nIt was explained how the husband-and-wife \" triangular \" marriage had\nbeen replaced by one democratically\nbased on loyalty and love. Modern\nsociety considered it to be wrong to\nmarry if one is not in love.\nSurely it is also wrong for a couple\nto remain married if they are no\nlonger in love ?

    "content": "FELIX3 By a Felix Staff Reporter\nBOOZE\nBELLY DANCERS\nBEDLAM\np RESUMABLY in an attempt to discourage unwanted visitors, the\nR.C.S. Union Meeting on 23rd November was held with the\nminimum of publicity.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read, from which it emerged\na film of the recent Spanner as the particpants seemed to, and the\nthat\nsnatch would not be available as was\nhoped. This was attributed to Guilds\nrefusing to return Spanner for photo-graphing.\nA shout for the Queen of Jez to\nmove to the platform proved unsuccessful. Demurely, she preferred to\nremain on the front bench.\nCARNIVAL It was disclosed that the R.C.S. Carnival on 3rd December would\nhave professional belly-dancers as\npart of the entertainment. Tickets for\nthe event (25/- double) are now on\nsale.\nThe proposed constitutional change\nthat a commit ee of th re be elected\nfrom the floor for the purposes of\npublicity, under the chairmanship of\nthe Publicity Officer, provided a diversion from the gravity of the rest\nof the meeting. An amendment that\neach department should elect one\nmember for the committee was de-feat ed. After a deal of wrangling, the\nmotion, put to the vote, was passed\nalmost unanimously, and now passes\nto the next Union Meeting for a second hearing.\nBack to the serious side of the\nmeeting. The Swimming Gala was\nnext on the agenda. Vice-President\nKen West in black corset and stockings and Secretary Ian Kershaw gave\nan \" exhibition\" of the various\nstrokes to be used. The audience\nknew as little of what was intended\nreward for their \" efforts\" was an\nembarrassed silence and a sense of\nbewilderment. Indeed, after a time,\nthe executive looked as embarrassed\nas the audience at this fiasco.\nMISS WORLD\nTed Needham was then elected\nMiss World, to be crowned at the\nSwimming Gala. This about sums up\nth\u00ab tone of the meeting.\nTwo teams of four then ran two\n\" boat races\" in which the Union\nhad the pleasure of watching sixteen\npints of beer half drunk and half\nspilled over the floor. After this enjoyable climax\u2014presumably the teams\nenjoyed it anyway\u2014came any other\nbusiness.\nAn R.C.S. diary was proposed by\nKen West and he promised to look\ninto the feasibility of it. A complaint\nabout rubbish in the theatre was accepted and the treasurer's report de-live red. AFRICAN After a brief argument about\nCouncil minutes, the meeting was\nclosed with a Kangela. A sad comment on the meeting\u2014even the Union\nchant was misspelled three times.\nFootnote : It is reported that\nRCSU's Publicity Officer was too\nhard-pressed over advertising Bedouins to be able to afford adequate\npre-publicity to the Union Meeting.\nFelix hopes that the new committee\nmay remedy any such recurrence.\nRhodesia Debate\u2014Report, see page 10.\nCOMPULSORY HALL DINNERS\nKEO GH MEALS ON HALL BILL\nJ \u00a3EOGH HALL has initiated a system of regular \" Dining-in\nevenings,\" the cost of which will be added each term to the hall\nbill. This sweeping step was only taken after a thorough investigation (via a questionnaire) into the form these dinners should take\nand the popularity of the idea itself, followed by a referendum,\nft seems that \" Keoghlogians \" are held every other week on Mondays,\nparticularly keen to meet their companions in hall, so these dinners will\nprovide a pleasant method of becoming acquainted with people not on\none's own staircase, who might otherwise not cross one's path. When the\nHall was asked to accept or reject t ne plan, it accepted it \" en masse.\" In\nthis College the result seems startling.\nIn other Colleges dining-in for hall\nresidents is often a nightly occurrence.\nNothing quite so devastating is planned in Keogh. The dinners are to be\nTuesdays or Wednesdays at 6.00 p.m. in the Staff Dining Room, Southside.\nReligious Exceptions\nIt should be pointed out that exceptions can, and will, be made for people\nwho, for say religious reasons, find\nthey are unable to attend the dinners.\nSuch people will merely be asked to\nexplain, in person, their reasons to\nthe Hall Committee. It is hoped the\nnumber of these exceptions will be\nminimal.\nPETE WALL UM WHO BELIEVES\nAGNOSTIC P.G. s, THEISTIC WOMEN\nANALYSIS HAS been completed of the recent survey of religious beliefs in the college, showing that against 28 per cent,\natheists, 55 per cent, of those interviewed profess to believe in God;\nhowever 46 per cent, of the whole sample never go to church and\nonly 22 per cent, go weekly,\nMini-,men seem markedly irreligious\ncompared with the other colleges\n(which have figures nearer to the I.C. average), with only 9 per cent regularly attending church.\nAn interesting trend is the decrease\nin belief in God with progression from\n1st year (60 per cent) to PCs(25 per\ncent), balanced by a corresponding increase in agnosticism rather than\natheism. Church-going habits however\nremain constant. The girls of the colledge predominantly believe in God\n(77 per cent.) but rarely attend Church\n(11 per cent.).\nTo the question \"What do you think\nof les us Christ\" answers varied from\n\" He never existed \" to \" He was an\ninfluential exponent of a social st ruc ture.\" 28 per cent, believed He was\nthe son of God but 37 per cent, that\nHe was something out of the ordinary.\nReligion Ignored\nTo nearly half the college the\nChristian is a product of environmental pressure and a large number of\nstudents have never given Christianity\nserious consideration one way or the\nother, or religious issues at all for\nthat matter.\nA similar survey in R.C.M. revealed\na very much higher Christian bias.\nCopies of the analysis can be obtained from A. I. Mayo, Falmouth\nHall or Union Rack.\nEd.: The survey, carried out by I.C.

This year, diligent preparations are being made to\nform a team combination capable of\nbringing the Cup back to I.C.. This\ntakes the form of training together\nwith the University players eligible\nfor the competition. In addition,\nefforts are being made to invite professional players to discuss tactics with\nthe team in order to get some measure\nof unity .among the players.\nIn previous years it could be said\nthat I.C. had too many players who\ncould not be expected to combine\nwell with the nucleus of the regular\nLeague team for just three games a year. However, this year, as there are\nonly two such players, a better degree\nof combination should be ^achieved.\nThe first team prospects against\nU.C. look reasonably favourable,\nhaving already drawn with tham in\nthe League with a slightly weakened\nteam.

Last year,\nthere were seven hundred and seventy-two\noverseas students in the college, or one in 4.2.\nThis is much higher than the national average for universities which is one in ten.\nSome of these students are from European\ncountries and North America, but the majority are\nfrom other continents. Usually they come to\nImperial College direct from their own country,\nand find themselves plunged into our English\nsociety with some very strange customs. How do\nthey react? What do they think of us?\nThe student from abroad can usually be picked\nout from a crowd by his physical characteristics;\nthis makes him feel different. It is emphasised by\nlanguage problems. A large number of the students\nwill find themselves having to speak English\nexclusively for the first time in their lives. As one third year Malaysian said, \" Don't criticize\nthe English in my report, I think it is amazing that\nI have produced anything in a foreign language.\"\nAccommodation Troubles\nHis main difficulty is with accommodation, a problem which we all share. Unfortunately,\nthough, there are many landladies who will not\ntake lodgers who look foreign, this problem\ngets worse as the student's skin gets darker. He\ncan get help in finding accommodation from the\nUniversity Lodgings Bureau or the British\nCouncil, or in cases of real difficulty Mr. Mc Dowell, secretary of the Rector's committee on\nOverseas Students, can help. This cannot reduce\nthe embarrassment felt when he answers advertisements for flats or digs and is told, \" Sorry, no\nblacks.\"\nAt Imperial College there is a large number of\nnationalistic societies. I cannot help feeling that\nthe very number of them is in some way an indication of our failure to form an integrated\ncommunity at Imperial. We have a society for\nrac raj equality and an International Relations\nClub, but they concern themselves in the main with\nwhat is going on in the world at large\u2014perhaps we\nought to set our own house in order first. What is\nit that goes wrong? It is unlikely that many people\nwill have another opportunity of meeting others\nfrom different cultures.\nThe Good Ladies at Chelsea\nThere are several bodies which exist outside\nthe college which offer friendship to the foreign\nstudents, but many of them seem to exist in order\nfor the \" good Ladies \" of Chelsea and Kensington to demonstrate their virtuosity to each other.\nHowever good some of these organisations may be,\nit is still a reflection on our hospitality as fellow\nstudents that they exist at all. The British Council\nruns the London Overseas Students Centre which\nprovides a focal point for the foreign student in London. Any British student who wishes to can\nget free honorary membership of the centre, but\nfew take advantage of this. The effect of bodies\nsuch as this is to make it easier for a student from\nsay. Africa, to make friends with a student from\nInd:\na, than one from Britain.\nThe main problem, along with accommodation,\nwhich besets the student from abroad is the vaca-t ions. When the term ends we all go home, or at\nleast those of us with families in the British Isles\ndo, but the student who is living in a foreign\ncountry, and who has not got a great deal of\nmoney, cannot. Some are lucky, and will be able\nto spend this Christmas at a Centre such as that\nat Hans Crescent, or will have been given an in vita ion to spend the holiday with a family in this\ncountry. Others will not be so lucky and will be\nfacing the thought of Christmas alone in digs.\nThis is somewhere where we can help\u2014see opp o site.\nJ. CAWS ON TT WAS FOUND on talking to a variety\nof I.C. students (born in the U.K.) that\nthe majority were oblivious of the existence\nof the committee. Mr. McDowell, the secretary, was therefore asked to talk to Felix\nabout how the committee tries to help overseas students.\nBefore the beginning of the academic year an\nintroductory day is organised. This consists of\nan information morning, when the students are\ngiven a talk on the history of the College, and\nmeet various College officials whom they can ask\nabout lodgings, health facilities etc. etc. They\nare then given lunch, and the afternoon is devoted\nto a departmental guide, ending in tea. This\nyear 140 out of the 300 overseas fresher s attended\nthe above meeting.\nOverseas students are welcome to go to see Mr. McDowell whenever they come up against problems. Generally he finds language and trouble in\nfinding accommodation constitute the greatest\ndifficulties. Often he helps with more unusual\nproblems such as nursery schools for students'\nchildren.\nMr. McDowell's greatest worry is trying to\nhelp overseas students during vacation, when\noften they find themselves alone.\nOne of the answers to this problem is for an\nEnglish family to have a student to stay with them,\nand often this is the only opportunity for the\nstudent to See life in an English home.\nCLAIRE SOUTER If there is any British Student\nin college who would like to entertain an overseas student in his\nhome this Christmas would he get\nin touch with us and we will try\nto put him in contact with one. If\nany overseas student would like\nto take advantage of any offers,\nwill he or she do the same. Please\ncontact Claire Souter, room 130\nNew Beit, or through the Felix\npigeon hole in the Union Rack.\nBewildered\nBuddhist\nin Britain\nLAY HART AN is a Chinese student\nfrom Singapore\u2014a second year chemist.\nShe came to Britain because of the better\nfacilities fo* studying science, because she\nhad heard of I.C., and also for the opportunity of living abroad ; she hopes to return\nto Singapore after her degree.\nLay Har -was in digs in Holloway last year, and\nnow she has digs irt Earls Court. She says that\nbecause she was in digs a long way out< she took\nvery little part in college activities last year; she\nwas only a member of the Chinese Soc. and the\nBuddhist Culture Soc, and had very little social\nlife, (apart from I CW A functions).\nMost students from overseas, apart from s cho lars, come from wealthy homes (otherwise they\nwould not be here), and she said that in her case,\nthis meant that in Singapore she had led a very\ncosy life, whe se most things were done for her.\nComing to I.C. was a very abrupt change, and\nmeant a great adjustment. There are difficulties\nin obtaining lodging for non-Europeans, difficulties in communicating with British students, different customs, and all this is very confusing to\na foreigner. Thus Lay Har feels that the College\ndoes not adequately help overseas students newly\narrived in Britain, especially in their first term,\nand thinks that more ought to be done. She said,\nhowever, that she was lucky in having a very helpful Personal Tutor, but many people did not even\nknow who theirs was.\nShe thinks that where to stay, and what to do\nduring the holidays, can some ime s be a problem\nwith foreign students, but that she is lucky in\nhaving relations near London. However, although\nher impressions of her first term at I.C. were\nsimply of bewilderment,, this year she intends to\nhave a fuller college life.\nM.J. BELL. Troubled\nAfrican\nChristmas dinner at the British Council\nResidence for Commonwealth Students in\nHans Crescent\n\" \u00a7 OME ENGLISH boys are all right. 1\nsuppose that it is partly our fault\u2014\noverseas students should try to talk to the\nBritish students and not Wait to be approached by them.\"\nSam is a student from East Africa. This is his\nsecond year in England but his first at Imperial\nCollege.\nHe spent his first year in digs in South London\nwhilst he attended a technical college. He was\nthrown out of his first digs with only six hours\nnotice, shortly after his arrival in Britain. In this\ncase the British Council was able to help him, and\nhe soon got some more.\nThis year he has been more fortunate, and is\nliving in a room in East Africa House. East\nAfrica House is a hall of residence, built for\nstudents in London who are nationals of one of the\nEast African Countries, It is typical of several\nresidences which have been set up for students from\nspecific countries. His room is a small area, partitioned off from a larger room. For this reason\nit is noisy, and at \u00a35 12s.6d.a week is fairly\nexpensive.\nDoes he like Imperial College? \" Well, the\nstandard of education is good.\" Socially? \" I belong to Wellsoc and the Africa Society but no\nother clubs.\" If he misses his meal at seven\no 'clock, he will either have to pay for another one\nor go without. This acts as a severe barrier to\nhis activities.\nAlthough most students, from overseas tend to\ndo more academic work than their English\ncounterparts, Sam finds that most of his studies\nare confined to work at college, except for periods\nimmediately before exams.\nS.I.D.
