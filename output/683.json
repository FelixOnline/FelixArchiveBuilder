    "content": "CREVIEWS;\nBOOKS\nAge of\nReason\n'...accessory of the day: a copy\nof Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Age of\nReason', worn in the back\npocket.'\n('The Face', October '84, on\nDavid Bowie's next video.)\nBOOKS TO BE SEEN: ART,\nFASHION, AND CUNNING\nThe trick is, of course, to make\npeople like you from a distance. Displaying the right\nattitudes is more important\nthan believing in them. The\nsmug corner of the bar may be\nthe den of spiky, black-leather, trainee psychopaths,\nbut we know that people who\nARE 'living on the edge'\ndribble, and wear top hats\nmade out of baked-beans tins. The man who reads Germaine\nGreer on his way to work may\nindeed care about equality,\nbut there again, his motto\nmight be KNOW YOUR ENEMY. Sincerity went out\nwith student politics and blue\njeans, so get the martini,\npractise your sneer, and\nwelcome to the Age of\nReason...\nMathieu is a right bastard,\nand therefore one of us.\nHaving made his mistress\npregnant, he has to think of a( fairly) decent way of avoiding\nhis responsibilities. He is an\nExistentialist, you see. If you\ndon't see read 'Existentialism\nand Humanism,' also by\nSartre. Good word, isn't it? His\nfriend Daniel,a( fairly)\nrepressed homosexual, thinks\nit would be really funny to get\nMathieu into a nasty marriage.\nMeanwhile, Mathieu fancies\nthe eighteen-year-old sister of\none of his students (yes, he's a lecturer. Didn't you guess?).\nShe, in turn, despises Mathieu. except when he\nsticks a knife into his hand just\nto show how easy it is . All this\nand World War two, too. 'The\nAge of Reason' is the first part\nof the 'Roads to Freedom'\ntrilogy. The time-span of the\nentire book is just three days,\n, giving plenty of scope for the\nmain characters' careful analysis of their own navels.\nVanity is cool. Theotherparts:\n'The Reprieve' and 7ron in the\nSoul' chart the coming of war\nand the fall of France, using\nthe same crew of navel\nspecialists. Dallas bites the\ndirt.\nAll of this hints at some\nground \u2014 rules for what can\nbe used as fashions and what\ncannot. First not many people,\nin publishing terms, should be\nreading it at the moment.\nExclusivity is the first condition. It is important,\nthough, that enough will be\nsold so that it will be available\nin paperback. This means that\nthe book will be small enough\nto carry around, and perhaps\nfit in your pocket with the title\nshowing. Hardbacks are too\nostentatious \u2014 usually bought by people who only\nread a little and for the wrong\nreasons \u2014 and don't get\nbattered so easily to show that\nyou have read the book more\nthan once. (Lit-lore: a good\nbook will only be fully\nunderstood after the third\nreading).\nSome kind of philosophy\nhelps, as long as it is in the\nbackground. Sartre cannot\nresist putting in some really\nobvious symbolic Act on\nevery third page. This means\nthat even if the story bores\nyou, the whole thi qg can be\ntreated as a kind if cross-word. Again exercise discretion. We are now getting\ninto A Level Eng Lit territory,\nand the only way to approach\nart is as a gifted amateur.\nNever in order to please some\npompous fool who got a PhD\nby quantifying. You know the\nsort of thing: fifty points for a sub-plot, ten for an allusion.\nNaturally, there must be sex\nin the book. The key word\nhere is 'natural'. If you force\nthe pace, then you've blown it.\nStand up Shirley Conran, and\ntake a bow. In 'Lace' (awful\nbook \u2014 I borrowed it from my\nAunt) she put the phrase 'he\nwas the Nijinsky of cunnilingus' in a serious context.\nFor this she ought to have her\nhead banged between two\ntypewriters. But then there are\nother books which would\nmake you look even more of a fool. READ, MEMO RISE AND DESTROY Alex Comfort's 'The Joy of Sex' and our very\nown '...but were afraid to ask.'\nOn the shelf they are about as\ncool as a provisional driving\nlicence. And anyway, didn't your Mother ever tell you that\nreading under the bed-clothes\nby torchlight will ruin your\neyes? Low-life is the key, and\nthe lower the better. Anything\nby Henry Miller ought to fit the\nbill. Also check out William\nGolding \u2014 he's not so\nobvious, but can get very, very\nnasty when you think it over.\n'The Spire' and 'Rites of\nPassage' qualify with ease.\nThe Book Of The Film is\nright out of all this. TV spinoffs even more so. Shame\nabout 'Brideshead revisited,\nbut we must be firm, because\ndetails count. There are\nexceptions, though. Everyone\nknows that the film 'Apoca-ly ps e Now' was based on\nJoseph Conrad's 'Heart of\nDarkness', albeit brought\nforward by about one hundred\nyears. But did you see the\nbooks on Colonel Kurtz's disk? 'From Ritual to\nRomance' by Jessie L Weston,\nand 'The Golden Bough' by JG Frazer (for it is they) are\nboth referred to by TS Eliot as\nsources for his poem 'The\nWaste Land'. And guess what\n\u2014 the facsimile editions show\na quotation from Heart of\nDarkness' as an epi graph. All\nvery tenuous I know, but you\nmust admit that it would\nsound impressive, if only you\ncould keep the smirk off your\nface. So all of these books are\nsafe to carry. Of course, as\nwith music, clothes, and\ndangerous sports, it is best to\nhave seen it, done it, been\nthere, got bored with it just in\ntime for the thing to get\npopular.\nThe uses of literacy: If you\nhang around the Royal School\nof Mines for long enough, you\nwill find someone trying to\nloan you a copy of the very\narty and very controversial\n'The White Hotel' by DM Thomas. This can work in a subtle way. Having lured his\nvictim into conversation (and\nwe ARE talking war, here) the\ngentleman in question casually asks what Victim\nthinks of DM Thomas.\nVictim: Dylan Thomas? Yes\nhe's good. Rage, rage against\nthe dying of the light. Moving.\nJohn{w\\ th a forgiving smile):\nAh. No, not DM Thomas. Easy\nmistake to make. I 've just read\n'The White Hotel' and I think\nhe is a genius, original...\nwitty...a major contribution to\nroad safety etc...\nVictim: Really? I must read\nsome.\nWell, you can work the rest\nout. John presents Victim with\nthe book, complete with gee-whizz jacket blurb by assorted\nwunder kind and the man from\nthe TLS. Next time they meet,\nVictim will find a straight \u2014\nfaced John cool y discussing\nexperimental pornography,\ntouch e. And what is more, she\ncan't use the standard reply\n'sod off you dirty old man',\nbecause she would then feel\nlike a phil is time. John says his\nsuccess rate is better than\neight out of ten.\nJohn is a right bastard, and\ntherefore one of us.\nSINGLES\n45 *P Hall & Oates: Out of Touch\nAnyone vaguely interested\nin music cannot have failed to\nnotice the impact club/disco/\nfunk/soul discs are having on\nthe British Charts. Seems like\nDaryl & John have just caught\non to this, and decided to cash\nin. As a soul record this is not\noutstanding, as a Hall & Oates\nrecord it is disappointing.\nGive up on it fell as. Go back to\nwhat you're good at.\nJohnny Spencer& The Remnants Of The Once Proud\nPasta font Bred B army Ensemble: The Strike Song\nI don't believe this. I think\nIan McGregor must have\nbrought it out. Could put you\noff supporting the Miners for\nlife. I'd rather listen to rice\ncri spies! Meatloaf: Modern Girl\nTrying to recreate the\nbrilliance of 'Bat out of Hell'\ntype classics, Meatloaf has\ngone back to a Jim Stainman\nstyle of production, although\nnot back to the man himself.\nDespite shades of 'Paradise\nBy the Dashboard Light', this\nis the best thing for along time from this colossus of rock.\nCharlene: We're Both In Love\nWith You\nEver since 'Never been to\nme', I 've hated just about\neverything from Charlene.\nShe is so pretentiously American and can make the\nroughest song in the world\nsound like a bowl of warm\ngolden syrup. On this one the\ntune is great, the lyrics equally\nas good. Charlene is ugh!\nKenny Rogers, Kim Carnes,\nJames Ingram: What About\nMe\nThere seems to be a trend in\nthe US to put lots of mega stars together, spend lots of money\non fancy production, and then\nto release a trash single like\nthis. Surely, experienced singers like these must know\nhow awful this is. Maybe they\ndon't care.\n10 Friday 19 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBSJ\nMembers of the City & Guilds\nknotty cerebral teasers, we wish to fashion a new pedal car for the Bristol '85 pedal car\nrally, a paltry 24 hour say-hello-to Hades\nsession.\nSo anyone not already caught by a terminal addiction to these mechanical\nabortions (All proudly displayed at the\nFreshers Fair) and possessed of a penchant\nfor burning off Mercs and Porches under\ntheir own steam, should materialise in\nSouthside Upper Lounge at 1.00pm on\nWednesday. This minor concession to my\nwill earns all willing victims a chance to test-drive the Windcheetah (and if you're also\nHuman Powered Vehicle Club\nsuffering advanced senile dementia, a crack\nat the pedal cars too.) I will organise a trip\ndown to Richmond the next week for the\nsurvivors. (It really helps if you have a bike).\nThere is one minor penalty for such apparent\ngenerosity \u2014 I have to clear out the rather\nrandom is ed pedal car room for which I require willing beasts of labour (see I hide\nnothing from you).\nIf, by any chance, you cannot attend at the\nappointed hour contact Piers Gaffney via the\nChem 111 letter rack or leave a note in the\nHPV pig ion hole in the C&G union office.\nC&G HPV\nPedalling\nfor profit\nWould you like to help vindicate the name of\nIC as one of the top engineering colleges in\nBritain today or, alternatively, expose it for\nwhat is is? well here's your chance. C&G HPV( Human Powered Vehicle) Club is the\none for you and open to all. This invitation is\nopen to all those ranging from the\neducationally subnormal with a yen for bag-of-bolt engineering (we built and race\nphenomenally Heath -Robinson pedal cars at\nvarious charity events) to those cat iv a ted by\nthe thrill of racing posey, high speed, finely\ntuned ve loci pe des( our old vehicles, the\nBurrows Windcheetah SL, has done\nwell over60 mph down hill and about 45mph on the flat for a mile or so) We still race in\nnational HPV competitions and a flash\nspanking new, faring is nearly completed.\nWe have a long term objective of building a somewhat revolutionary HPV to put the\nwillies up the best of our opponents, as well\nas a weather eye looking to pull a few of the\nmore lucrative cash prizes around (Does a cut in $10,000 tempt you?).\nFor those wishing to engage with such\nCHRISTIAN\nRetreat\nto Allington\nThe Christian Union pre-term house party\nlast month took place amid the medieval\nsplendour of Allington Castle, near\nMaidstone in Kent. It began on the afternoon\nof Tuesday 25 September and ended after\nlunch on the following Friday.\nThose of us who travelled by train found\nthat the 'short' walk from the station to the\ncastle took at least an hour, and some of the\nmotorists also found that their transport\ndidn't quite take them to the front door\u2014a Beetle with broken suspension was beyond\nrepair. We were pleased to find however,\nthat we were well looked after by the\nCarmelite friars (no connection with KP)\nwho have been running Allington Castle as a retreat and conference centre for Christian\ngroups for several decades.\nThere has been an increasing degree of cooperation between the various Christian\ngroups in College over the past year, and this\ntrend was continued by the presence of\nseveral members of the West London\nChaplaincy, Cathsoc and by the whole\nChaplaincy conference joining the CU for\nworship on Friday morning. The rest of the\ntime was spent in worship and in prayer,\nparticularly to ask for God's help and\nguidance in running the Christian Union\nduring the coming year.\nWe also had the pleasure of the company\nof John Irving of Holy Trinity, Brompton who\nled an enlightening and interesting study of 2\nTimothy. There was, of course, usual\nsmattering of John's famous anecdotes.\nA good time was had by everyone and I feel\nsure we would all agree that the conference\nwas an ideal way to start the term.\nDEBA TING\nNuclearPower\nWhat will nuclear power do for us in the long\nterm? There are those who say it will release\nus from a dependence on fossil fuels, and,\nwith proper waste management, give us a pollution free power supply. Also, with the\nadvent of fusion power, we will gain an\nalmost limitless source of energy. Others\nbelieve that leaks of radiation and reactor\naccidents will create the worst ecological\ndisaster man has ever inflicted upon himself,\nand that the security required during\ntransport of radioactive materials will\nseriously erode our freedoms.\nOn Tuesday 23 October representatives\nfrom both sides, Dr Llewdy from the UK Atomic Energy Authority and George\nPritchard, Campaigner for Greenpeace will\ndebate the nuclear issue.

    "content": "CFEATURE\nPART II\nMoney off your rent\nLast week we saw how to claim Housing Benefit during term\ntime. In this issue the appeals procedure is explained, for those\nwho feel that the local authority have made an unfair decision.\nAppeals\nIf you are unhappy with any decision made\nby the local authority you have the right to\nappeal. There are a number of stages in this\nprocedure.\n1 Local authority (LA) inform you of their\ninitial decision. You have a right to ask for a( written breakdown of how your benefit has\nbeen assessed: When you receive this i breakdown it is probably wise to check the;\nfigures with Students Services.\n2 If you are not happy with tis assessment'\nyou have six weeks to write to the LA asking\nthem to look again at your case giving your\nreasons why you think their assessment is\nincorrect. They will inform you in writing of\nthe result of this review.\n3 If you are still not satisfied you have 28\ndays in which to ask for your case to go\nbefore a review board. This is a fairly informal\nhearing when the LA and yourself put your\ncase before three councillors who them\nmake a decision. Student Services can j arrange representation for you at a review j board hearing so don't be worried about\npushing your case forward \u2014 it's not nearly\nas threatening as it's made to sound.\n4 Finally, if you wish to take the matter still\nfurther you can appeal to the courts.\nDon't be afraid to push for a review of your\ncase as there are still a disconcerting number\nof errors being made in initial assessments.\nStudent claims are extremely complex to\ncalculate and therefore some mistakes and\ndelays are bound to occur but you are\nentitled to these monies so don't allow\nyourself to be defeated by Town Hall\nbureaucracies.\nWarning to Overseas Students\nApplying for rent and rate rebates is\nconsidered to be recourse to public funds\nand is therefore in contravention of your\nconditions of stay in this country. Although\napplications are not frequently checked you\ncould be in serious trouble with the Home\nOffice if it was discovered that you had made\nan application.\nConclusion\nThe 'Unified Housing Benefit' system has\nnow been in operation for just over 1 year. At\nits outset it was intended to unify and simplify\nthe dual systems then operated by Local\nHousing Authorities and the DHSS. In reality\nit has created yet more confusion and\nfinancial hardship for those least able to\ncarry the burden. The whole situation has\nbeen further aggravated by the introduction\nof more amendments to the scheme in both\nApril and November of this year, and by\nsevere staff shortages in many housing\nbenefit departments. Consequently\nalthough all the details in this article are, to\nthe best of my knowledge, correct at the time\nof going to press, students may find\nthemselves subject to contra dic a tory advice\nfrom individual officers at local Town Halls. If\nyou are unsure about anything you have\nbeen told make sure you check it out with\nStudent Services or you could end up losing\nmoney.\nChasing up unpaid benefits \u2014 If you want to\ncheck up on the progress of your claim you\ncan ring the relevant Housing Benefit\ndepartment (visits to the departments in\nmany boroughs are simply time consuming\nand pointless). When you are finally\nconnected, you will not usually be talking to\nthe person who is actually dealing with your\nclaim so it is pointless venting your\nfrustration on them. However if you are not\nsatisfied with the answers you receive, you\ncan ask to speak to the actual assessment\nofficer dealing with your case although they\nare frequently 'not available'. If you live in\nKensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith or\nWandsworth you can expect to hear\nsomething within about two months of\nsubmitting your claim but in parts of Fulham,\nWestminster and Lambeth the await is more\nlikely to be around six to nine months so\ndon't bother ringing too soon or too often as\nit simply clogs up the switchboards and\ndelays claims even longer. Student s are still\nautomatically given a very low priority in\nmost boroughs but if your are experiencing\nparticularly severe financial problems eg you\nare a student without a grant or you are\nfacing landlord problems through nonpayment of rent then make these facts\nkn^v v n to your assessment officer and most\nwill try to be sympathetic. If you are unhappy\nwith the way in which your case has been\ndealt with you can write to the Chairman of\nthe Housing Committee in your borough and\ncomplain to your MP( this is quite a useful\nexercise since many MPs are still blissfully\nunaware of the hardships the Housing\nBenefit scheme is causing). However before\naggravating your local authority too much it\nis wise to seek help over any difficulties from\nStudent Services as we are happy to contact\nauthorities on your behalf and may be able to\nhelp peacefully resolve any conflicts.\nThe numbers for the main authorities around\nthe College are given below:\nHammersmith & Fulham 7748 3020\nKensington & Chelsea 937 5464\nLambeth 274 7722\nWandsworth 871 1255\nWestminister 828 8070\nGOOD NCUS ,HAvrE'R, you ft^ REBATE WAS ARK/VCD! hie cm\nmove BACK TO Ttfe CASTLF\n^ \u2014 \u2014 N/ ow!\nFriday 19 October 1984 FELIX\n\n"

After a hard\nfought game and some very\ndubious umpiring, IC were\nunfortunate to be on the wrong\nend of a1 \u20140 score line. College certainly had opportunities to score, particularly during a spell of\nsustained pressure early in the\nsecond half. A fine performance\nin goal by Jonathon West\nprevented a higher score for\nKodak, but overall this was a game that IC felt that they could\nhave won, despite the fact that\nthey were a player short.

Mill Hill countered\nstrongly to go into a21 lead at\nhalf-time. After the interval, tight\ndefensive play from both sides\nensured no further score.\nGoalkeeper Rolf Slatter made\nmany fine saves, thus keeping\nthe score respectable.

Just read the passage\nbelow, answer the simple questions, and send your\nentry to the FELIX Office.\nHere'sy our chance to\ncelebrate the festive season in\ntrue style by winning presentation bottles of\nGlenmorangie Single Highland Malt Whisky.\nWhat is a 'single malt'\nwhisky? It is the original\nScotch Whisky \u2014 the un blended product of a single\nmalt distillery, which has been\nproduced and allowed to\nmature according to time\nhonoured practices.\nThe name Glenmorangie\nderives from the Gaelic and\nmeans 'the Glen of Tranq u ili ty'. Tr an qui Ii ty \u2014 a particularly appropriate description for the magn if i cent location and atmosphere of the Glen moran gie Distillery, in which\nthe new Whisky is born and\nrests for ten years of\nmaturation.\nGlenmorangie has its own\nprivate water source\u2014the\nTarlogie Springs, which pass\nthrough red sandstone set\ndeep in the distillery's own\nforest and give unusually\nhard, mineral-rich water. Only\nthe best Highland Ross-shire\nbarley is malted for Glenmorangie and this is lightly\npeat ed as it is dried imparting a subtle smokiness\nto the spirit and preserving\ndelicacy of flavour.\nBut it is the stills used to\nrefine the new spirit which are\nprobably the single most\nimportant factor in shaping\nGlen moran gie's unique character. Installed in 1880,\nGlenmorangie's copper pot\nstills, though small, are the\ntallest in the Highlands\u2014at\n16ft10.25 in s, dwarfing the\nsquatter pot stills of other\ndistillers. These Glen moran gie stills ensure that\nonly the purest vapour s ascend to the top of the neck\ncolumn.\nAfter this, maturation is\naffected in American oak\ncasks which allow the\ndelicacy and\ndevelop.

They were met\noutside the Chemistry Building\nby a group of RCS students\ncarrying fire extinguishers. An opposing group of Guildsmen\nwere also present, including one\non a motorbike and two drinking\nfrom milk bottles, when the\nMascot was later driven away.\nRCS students discharged aC02 extinguisher as the motorbike\nattempted to follow the van,\ncausing the bike to stall. The milk\nbottles were subsequently\nthrown in the direction of\nrubbish skips, but it is not known\nby which party.\nA memorandum was delivered\nby hand later that day to both\nC CU Offices from ICU Deputy\nPresident David Parry. After\npointing out the dangers of\nremoving fire extinguishers, of\nC02 gas, and of broken glass.He\ntold C CU heads 'Mascotry is\nsupposed to be a friendly sport\nnot an exercise for GB H.I insist\nthat the use of C02 fire\nextinguishers is stopped immediately and bottles are not\nto be used.\nLater on Tuesday, between\n7.15pm and 7.30pm, the RC Smas eot 'Theta' was brought to\nthe College in the same VW van\nfor the Maths Freshers Dinner.\nRCS students stood at the main\nCollege gates and two fire\nextinguishers were seen near by,\nalthough they were not\ndischarged or used threateningly.\nAfter the van had driven\nthrough gates in the campus a white Ford Escort car drove into\nits path, and the gates were closed\nbehind the van. Both vehicles\nslowed down and stopped.\nBetween 20 and 60 RCS students\npushed the Ford out of the path\nof the van, which then continued\nto the Sherfield Building. The\nmascot Theta was taken into the\nMaths Dinner in the Sherfield\nRefectory.\nAfter the dinner Theta was\nloaded into the van and driven\naway along Exhibition Road.\nA green Morris Marina car,\nwhich was parked outside the\nPolish Hearth Club on Exhibition Road, tried to give\nchase, but was blocked by about\n50 to 60 RCS and C&G students\nin the road outside the main\nCollege gates. The car reversed\nand attempted to go down\nExhibition Road on the wrong\nside. An RCS student in this part\nof the road ended up on the\nbonnet of the car. The student\nwas not hurt; it is not clear if he\njumped onto the bonnet or if he\nwas hit by the car, which was then\neither stationary or moving at\nvery slow speed.\nThe car reversed again, and\ndrove towards the group on the\nother side of the road. The group\ndispersed and the car drove off at\nhigh speed, with a damaged wing\nand wing mirror. Mr Parry, who\nwas a guest at the dinner, asked\nstudents in the road to disperse.\nMr Ian Josebury, City and\nGuilds Union Vice President,\ntold FELIX he hoped that\nmascot ry should be conducted\nsafely. He thought Tuesday's events were not dangerous.\nMr Sean Davis, R CSU Vice\nPresident, was unwilling to make\nany statement.\nMASC0 TR V AGREEMENT The following has been agreed by the Constituent College Unions\n1. The CCU's do not condone:\na. any violence in mascot ry raids.\n(you are reminded that injury to any person may result in disciplinary and/or legal proceedings)\nb. the breakage of locks, chairs or structures which\nare not specifically and solely securing a mascot\nin place, or the last remaining obstacle to the\nmascot (e.g. cupboard). .\n2. Mascotry is no excuse to break the law.\nPeople breaking the law will have no recourse\nto College or Union authorities.\n3. The only vehicles which may be used for mascot ry1 n the College precincts will be those actually\ncarrying or collecting a mascot.\nAll vehicles must abide by College regulations\nand speed limits.\n4. In the oven t of any breakage occurring to College\nproperty or any injury being sustained to a member of the mascot ry team or any member of the public,\nthe President of 1\nCU should be Informed Immediately.\nANY RAID CONSIDERED IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE ABOVE GUIDELINES\nMAY RESULT IN THE PRESIDENTS INVOLVED INVALIDATING THE RAID AND THOSE PARTIES INVOLVED BEING FINED.\nMascotry is one of the oldest traditions of the Constituent College\nUnions. Each has its own violate mascot, that is to say one that is fair\ngame to steal; Theta, Spanner and Davy for RCS, C&G and RS M respectively.\nTeams from each C CU closely guard their own mascot, and\norganise 'raids' to try to steal other people's. The rules of mascot ry are embodied in the 'Mascotry Agreement' of\nOctober 1982, signed by all CCUs and ICU, and still in effect.\nA total of \u00a32100 was raised on Saturday as the CCUs tid d ly winked down Oxford Street for charity.

We must of\ncourse set all resistor values to one ohm to ensure that each\nsquare is square. Using Kirchoff's laws we find the dimensions\nof the squares to be 25, 24, 23, 22 19, 17,11, 6, 5, 3.\nAn alternative circuit is produced by turning the rectangle\nthrough a right angle and reconstructing the network.\nCongratulations to Neil Redman of Physics III who may\ncollect his \u00a35 cheque after 1.30pm from the Felix office on\nMonday.\nMy consolations go to Peter Ruffhead of computing who was\nthe only other person to solve the puzzle correctly.
