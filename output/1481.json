    "content": "A R T S\nFELIX\n22\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a welcome exception to my reading habits. It is not a\nwork of fiction, but rather the enthralling true story of a murder and the events surrounding it. It\nis doubtlessly one of the finest works of modern\nAmerican literature. It maintained a place on the\nNew York Times\u2019 Bestsellers list for over 200 consecutive weeks after the initial publication.\nSet in what is arguably one of the weirdest, yet\nmost beautiful cities in the United States \u2013 Savannah, Georgia \u2013 the story unravels at a typically\nSouthern pace. Rightly slow, and oddly soothing.\nWhile reading it, I can almost feel the warmth of a\nperfect Savannah summer night, with the sounds of\na moody, dark piano jazz being played a few houses\ndown.\nThe story, interesting as it is, is not the focus of\nthe book. Rather, John Berendt lets the city and\nits eccentric characters take centre stage. The\nauthor really captures what it is about each of the\ncharacters that makes them so interestingly real;\nfrom the crazy old man who walks a leash without\na dog through Oglethorpe Square to Jim Williams,\nthe wannabe aristocrat around whom the story re-volves.\nIt isn\u2019t every day that one finds a work of nonfiction that is as linguistically ornate as a work of\nfiction. Berendt\u2019s language, while not overwhelmingly similar, does have undertones that remind\nme of early Nabokov, yet it captures something\nthat is incongruently worthy of Harper Lee. An element of subdued, distorted reality is prevalent\nthroughout the book and is especially prevalent in\nthe cemetery scenes, set in the heart of Southern voodoo country. The writing is luxuriant, much\nlike the people and the city. It is near perfection.\nBerendt captures the essence of this picturesque,\nyet oddly disconnected place in deepest, darkest\nGeorgia.\nWhile there is an eponymous motion picture\nsomewhat based on the book, it could never do\nthe \u2018novel\u2019 justice, despite an outstanding performance by Kevin Spacey and an appearance by a\nvery young Jude Law. If you have not had the fortune of visiting Savannah, upon reading the book\nyou will want nothing more than getting on to the\nnext fight to Atlanta and catching the Greyhound\nthat gets you as close to Mercer House as humanly possible.\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nAfonso Campos extoles the virtues\nof one of America\u2019s finest pieces of\nmodern literature\nMidnight in\nthe Garden of\nGood and Evil by John Berendt\nGet a review in Felix and spread the word about that\nlife-changing book you\u2019ve read \u2013 Send 400 words to\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEat meat, think twice\nThe book that will make you a conscientious omnivore\nEating Animals is not a simple argument\nfor vegetarianism, but an intelligent insight into the culture, economy, business\nand impacts of meat production. Safran\nFoer makes a plea for more \u2018conscientious omnivores\u2019, making meal-by-meal\ndecisions. We should all think about the\nissues and where we stand, particularly\nin regards to resource use, as a topic that\neffects everyone on the planet\nThe book describes how the ever\ncheaper production methods used by\nfactory farms are not only the leading\ncause of global resource exploitation,\nhabitat loss and the biggest producer of\nCO2 emissions, it discusses how these\nsame companies continue to promote\nunhealthy and unsustainable dietary\nchoices at the expense of individual\nhealth, animal welfare and the control of\ncross-species viruses such as H1N1.\nAfter two award winning works of\nfiction (Extremely Loud and Incredibly\nClose and Everything Is Illuminated),\nEating Animals is Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s first work of non-fiction, turning\nhis pen with shocking effect to the very\nreal issues surrounding what it means to\neat meat. What is refreshing about Eating Animals is that Safran Foer is not a\nconservationist, nor is he an animal or\nenvironmental activist, he is a novelist.\nHis typographic techniques are quirky\nand visually creative and his storytelling sensibility is present from the first\nchapter. The book is both a narrative\nabout family values and our cultural\nlinks to food, and hard research into the\nsubject of eating meat. At a talk given at\nthe RSA earlier this month he described\nhow his initial investigations into meat\nproduction were not intended for the\npurposes of writing a book, but to find\nout for himself and his young family\n\u2018what meat is\u2019 and whether its good to\neat it.\nSafran Foer has managed to tackle\nthe issues surrounding eating meat in a\ntruly comprehensive manner (perhaps\nhe would have included more of the industry perspective on the topic if they\nhad ever replied to his requests for in-formation). From investigating the true\nmeaning of words such as \u2018bycatch\u2019\nand \u2018free-range\u2019 within the industry, to\ninterviewing factory workers and vegan\nslaughterhouse builders, his wilful pursuit for understanding led him at one\npoint, and against his own conviction, to\njoin an activist breaking into a chicken\nfarm to see for himself what was being\nso vehemently hidden behind the locked\nbarn doors. His genuine shock and anger at the realities he uncovers are relayed with fervour, often humorous and\nalways thoughtful and well researched.\nHis arguments for re-thinking factory\nfarming from the perspective of cross-species viruses, such as H1N1 (swine\nflu) are strong enough when considering global health. A pig farm in North\nCarolina was where bird, swine and human viruses combined in sickly, drug\nresistant animals to form this lethal, potentially pandemic virus and six of the\neight genetic segments of the (currently)\nmost feared virus in the world have been\nlinked directly to US factory farms.\nDuring the RSA talk, Safran Foer\nmentioned a statistic that any environmentally aware individual or car owner\nshould hear: \u2018If every American reduced\ntheir meat consumption by one meal a\nWatch or\nlisten to Safran\nFoer\u2019s talk with\nBibi van der\nZee at the RSA\non the RSA\nwebsite\nSarah Wilson\nJonathan Safran Foer in front of a happy, ethical brick wall. Nice wall, nice guy, probably...\n\u201cRelayed with\nfervour, often\nhumorous and always\nthoughtful\u201d\nweek it would be equivalent to taking 5\nmillion cars off the road\u2019.\nAs a recent convert to a fully vegetarian diet, I would be a massive liar if I\nsaid the aroma of bacon and eggs wafting from a road side caf\u00e9 doesn\u2019t send\nmy saliva glands into a frenzy, but after\nreading Eating Animals I realized that\nto call myself a conservationist and eat\nmeat, when I am lucky enough to have\nthe choice not to, is total hypocrisy. My\nwanting a steak is far outweighed by the\nneed to change an industry which has\ntaken over one third of land on planet\nearth and has genetically modified animals to the point they can no longer reproduce naturally.\nSafran Foer\u2019s aim is not to preach\nbut to inform and inspire people to ask\nthemselves questions about their food\nchoices, and Eating Animals fulfils\nthat aim with style. We must all draw\nour own lines in the sand, whether that\nmeans becoming a vegan, vegetarian or\njust cutting out one meat dish a week.\nWe must decide for ourselves, as said by\nSafran Foer\u2019s Grandmother at the start\nof the book, \u201cIf nothing matters, there is\nnothing to save\u201d.\nPeter Rigaud\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

The dogs could detect\ntraces of the disease in breath and stool samples\nwith almost 100% accuracy. Surprisingly, they were\nmost succesful at detecting the cancer in its earlier\nstages. The study shows that cancer specific chemicals are present in the gut. And while using dogs\nmay be impractical in the real world, it could lead to\nnew methods of early detection.\nDavid Ropeik tackles a subject that both fascinates\nand bewilders us, taking apart the human psyche to\ntry and explain why it is that we fear the things we\ndo, however irrational those fears are. He separates\nthe risks associated with common fears such as\nsnakes from long-term risks which in the end are the\nones that we are not instinctively able to deal with.\nRopeik explains both the mental process that has\nmade fear a fundamental part of our evolution and\nthe rational approach we have developed in dealing\nwith risks over time.\nThere is a distinct comparison that Ropeik seems\nto be trying to make between the modern iPhone\nwielding man and his cave-dwelling ancestors; he is\nwilling us to reassess what we are actually afraid of\nand the quantitative risks involved. This is an interesting and well written book, although not as exciting as I had hoped, it was a refreshing outlook on\nmodern life.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nDrug-resistant bacteria mapped\nCharlie Harvey\nThe genomes of hundreds of bacterial strains\nthat cause pneumonia have been sequenced and\nmay lead to new antibiotics and vaccines.\n240 lineages of multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae were collected from\naround the world and their genomes sequenced\nin order to understand how the bacteria came to\nbe so virulent.\nThe research, published in the journal Science this week, compared the genetic sequences with the geographic locations of each\nspecimen to produce a map of the major evolutionary events that have led to the diversity we\nsee today. The team of scientists also pinpointed Europe as the probable birthplace of the first\nmultidrug resistant individual.\nThe researchers also identified recombination\nas the dominant mechanism the bacteria have\nused to evolve resistance to antibiotic drugs.\nRecombination involves individual pieces of\nDNA moving around the bacterial genome, and\nin doing so creates new genes. Some of these\nrecombinations will result in the bacteria becoming resistant. Many of these drug resistant\ngenes can pass horizontally, from bacteria to\nbacteria, and could explain how drug resistance\nhas spread so quickly across the globe.\nFour million cases of fatal pneumococcal disease are reported each year, and, according to\nthe World Health Organisation, is responsible\nfor an estimated 18% of all deaths of children\nunder the age of 5.\nThe research was created thanks to a partnership between the Sanger Institute, a world\nleader in genomic analysis, and scientists from\nRockafeller University studying the patterns\nof illness around the world. Alexander Tomaz,\nco-author of the paper, praised the unusual col-laboration. \u201cSuch an alliance between molecular biology and epidemiology promises further\ninteresting insights into the mechanism of bacterial evolution\u201d.\nProfessor Brian Spratt, a molecular epidemi-ologist at Imperial highlighted the importance\nof this research, saying: \u201chow bacteria diversify over the very short time scales [...] are of\ncrucial importance for understanding and predicting the response of pathogens to new antibiotics and vaccines.\u201d\nKelly Oakes\nThis is not the galaxy you\u2019re looking for (the real galaxy wasn\u2019t as photogenic as this)\nIn a galaxy far, far away...\nThere haven\u2019t always been stars and galaxies\nin the universe, and the time when they began\nto form \u2014 known as the reionisation epoch \u2014\nis the subject of much interest in astrophysics.\nA paper published in Nature last week details\na discovery that could tell us more about this\nmysterious time.\nIn the paper, Rychard Bouwens and colleagues say they have detected the most distant\ngalaxy ever seen; the light from the galaxy was\nemitted only 500 million years after the Big\nBang. This age puts it well within the epoch of\nreionisation.\nThe galaxy has the highest redshift ever ob-served; it was from this that the team were able\nto calculate the galaxy\u2019s age.\nCosmological redshift is a measure of how\nfast an object is moving away from the Earth\nand is a consequence of the expanding Universe. Objects with higher redshift are moving\naway from the Earth faster than those with lower redshifts, which means they are further away\nfrom Earth and also further back in time. To\nput it simply, the higher the redshift the older\nthe galaxy.\nBouwens and colleagues used something\nknown as the Lyman-break technique to identify the galaxy. This technique relies on a sharp\ndrop in the spectrum of a galaxy that is due to\nthe absorption of energetic photons by neutral\ngas that surrounds galaxy forming regions. The\ndiscovery can then be confirmed by looking at\noptical images.\nFor a long time the observations required to\nstudy the reionisation epoch were out of reach,\nbut recent images from Hubble are making the\ndetection and study of far away galaxies possible for the first time. The new galaxy was\ndiscovered in images taken by Hubble\u2019s Wide\nField Camera 3.\nBouwens and colleagues also looked into the\nrate of star formation at the time just after the\nnewly discovered galaxy. They discovered that\nin just 200 million years the rate of star formation increased tenfold. This confirms that the\nnewly discovered galaxy is right in the heart\nof the reionisation epoch, and sheds new light\non how the stars and galaxies we see today\nformed.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing huge changes in the rate of star\nbirth that tell us that if we go a little further back\nin time we\u2019re going to see even more dramatic\nchanges,\u201d said Garth Illingworth, a co-author of\nthe paper from the University of California at\nSanta Cruz. \u201cWe\u2019re moving into a regime where\nthere are big changes afoot. Another couple of\nhundred million years back towards the Big\nBang, and that will be the time when the first\ngalaxies really are starting to build up.\u201d\nStreptococcus pneumoniae cause millions of deaths each year and looks horrible\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "DOES WATCHING TV RUIN\nYOUR SOCIAL\nLIFE?\nI\nfind going out on a Saturday night in London an\nodd thing. I\u2019ve usually had\na rough week, I\u2019m tired,\nfed-up with humanity, feeling miserable and in a pretty foul\nmood. I feel the onset of a cold\nthanks to a vitamin D deficiency\nthat the city\u2019s winter brings. I\nwould quite like to stay at home\nand lie on my backside all evening watching TV, but I know deep\ndown that would only make me feel like a sad\u2013arse friendless weirdo.\nNeedless to say, I would get mixed feelings.\nIndeed, I used to pooh-pooh the idea of spending an evening in Tramp,\nthe supposedly trendy Mayfair club. If invited, I would decline by offering some pompous rhetoric about its awful clientele of pathetic, insecure\nmales with more money than sense who would spend their nights buying\nthe attentions of broads best labeled as gold digging whores. You either\nhave to spend the evening inside the club, sitting next to some trust fund\nbaby, or standing outside in the cold having a fag with one of the Harry\nPotter nitwits. Classy it isn\u2019t.\nBut one day I accepted the invite. And having brought along a couple\nof friends, I spent a very merry evening tossing down martinis. Each\ncocktail made the place lighter, less stuffy, and more fun. What started\nout as a cynic looking for something to moan about turned out to be the\nbest bloody evening in ages. We roared with laughter, thumping the bar\ntable and cracking lame jokes. The point being that wherever you go out,\nthere\u2019s always bound to be a story to tell \u2013 good or bad \u2013 and you will be\nricher for the experience.\nYes, it was stupidly expensive, yes it was full of vulgar people, and yes\nI will probably never go back, but I am happy I went \u2013 what else would\nI have done? Watched some crap would-be singer be told his version of\nMy Way was better than Frank-\u201cThe Voice\u201d-Sinatra\u2019s by a prick with\nman breasts and a silly haircut?\nSince that night I\u2019ve been rationing my TV usage. TV, as the alternative option, is no more than a drowsy sedative. It\u2019s less likely to get you\nexcited than Valium. The whole thing is bollocks \u2013 Big Brother, Britain\u2019s\nGot Talent (if you count Amanda Holden\u2019s fake breasts that is), even the\nBBC 10 O\u2019clock News.\nPut simply, it\u2019s much more fun to watch people spray cream on each\nother\u2019s nipples in real life than it is on TV (just ask a Daily Mail journal-ist), in the same way it\u2019s far more enjoyable to create the news than listen\nto it (even if Mr. Woollard of fire extinguisher fame would disagree).\n20 felix\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nM\ny right honourable friend, despite having a\nnovel immune\nsystem that is\nsomehow dependant on vitamin D\ninstead of the usual vitamin C, convincingly raises the argument that\nwatching television makes one a\n\u201csad-arse friendless weirdo\u201d.\nI spend a colossal amount of time\nwatching television; and if you\nwere to ask any of my Twitter followers or Youtube subscribers, they\nwould doubtless testify to my erudite wit and charm. Scathing, self-de-preciating irony aside, while I\u2019m not out snorting cocaine off the tits of\n\u201cthird Hufflepuff on the left\u201d on a Saturday, watching television isn\u2019t the\ndeath of my social life.\nWhile, granted, I do mindlessly bask in such shows as Hole in the Wall,\nCome Dine with Me, not all TV is of the vapid variety. Popular television also has the advantage of being just that, popular. It is brilliant for\nfacilitating conversation.\nIn an office or around a table, television is second only to sport as a\nsure fire conversation starter. In fact at Western Europe\u2019s premier nerd\nemporium, I am probably safer trying to start a conversation about the\nfactual inaccuracies in an episode of The Big Bang Theory than why\nArsenal will fail to get any silverware this season.\nIt is common amongst those in our generation, while taking sips from\ntheir organic fair trade tea, to exclaim in a tone somewhere between\nmild derision and self importance \u201cwhy, I don\u2019t even own a television\u201d\nwith the commonly cited other diversions being \u201creading\u201d and \u201cactually\ntalking to people\u201d.I can debate, at length, on topics such as how Evelyn\nWaugh\u2019s repeated characterisation of women as treacherous changed in\ntype from intentionally malevolent to accidental by\u2013products of emotional insecurity as he grew older, as well as why I\u2019d like to kick X Factor\u2019s Cher Lloyd in the head. Loving television doesn\u2019t make you stupid.\nWhen pushed, the average \u201coh, I just find I\u2019ve started reading more\u201d\nperson is usually dribbling into Steig Larsson on their kindle and watching torrented episodes of Glee anyway.\nAll this conveniently brings me onto my final point. With online streaming and my \u201cfirst thing I\u2019d save in a house fire\u201d Sky + box, you can be\nselective about what you watch. Television is a shared cultural experience\nwhich is by far the easiest to partake in. The fact that it can be used as the\noffal filler that bulks out the Sainsbury\u2019s Basics sausage that represents\nyour day in no way prevents it from also providing beautiful haggis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more fun to\nwatch people spray\ncream on each\nothers\u2019 nipples in\nreal life\u201d\nCharles Betts Matt Allinson\nThe average Briton watches nearly four hours\nof TV a day \u2013 the average student probably\nwatches a lot more.The question is...\nTheArtus Break\nThe focus of my Fridays is the customary philosophy hour lunch break from my lectures.\nThat\u2019s when a bunch of Philosophy enthusiasts (read: Greg Artus fans) gather around in\nthe enclosed space once named the Pippard\nlecture theatre for their weekly dose of arguments and a fine prescription of debating.\nThe reason most of us like Greg\u2019s lectures\nis that he is quite the debater. Sort of like\nthe living version of Al Pacino in Devil\u2019s Advocate...or was it Keanu Reeves? Maybe he\u2019s\na mixture of both? One of my friends put it\nquite suitably: \u201cGreg is an enigmatic figure\nthat flies into lectures, says what he has to\nsay, leaves all of our heads buzzing like no\nother lecturer does and then disappears in\na puff of smoke.\u201d Funny thing is, no matter\nwhat course we are doing, we all find his\nwords a refreshing alternative to the monotone science courses we chose to come to\nstudy at Imperial in the first place. Oddly, the\nHumanities Department suffered from cuts\nrecently \u2013 anyone see a parallel today1\n?\nFunny thing is, no matter what subject we\ndo, we all find his words a refreshing alternative to the monotone science courses we\nchose to study in the first place.\nToday, Hobbes\u2019 Leviathan was discussed\nalong with his arguments for human nature\nbeing inherently flawed. This is backed up\nby the usual materialist psychology which\nclaims that humans are driven by self\u2013interest and do not have a natural inclination\ntowards others. Our desires and needs are\nwhat drive us and once we acquire some\nof our material needs, we are constantly\nvigilant and ready to fight in order to protect\nthem \u2013 \u2018the War of All against All\u2019.\nThis seems like a pessimistic view of hu-mans, I thought, as I took a bite of my spinach\u2013feta roll, but what would that mean?\nWhat does it mean to be self\u2013interested?\nIs it different from being selfish? Do we all\nact on immediate desires and do we only\npostpone these when we are in pursuit of\nanother, further desire? How could we always know what our best self-interests are\nand where does this leave altruism? Moreover, where does this leave love and the least\nself\u2013interested of acts \u2013 dying for another\nhuman being?\nApparently, humans are more inclined to\ndie for a close friend than a relative. Would\nyou die for a friend or a sibling? No matter\nwhat your answer might\u2019ve been, the truth is\nthat you don\u2019t know what you would do until\nyou were put into the situation and forced to\nchoose. Your actions speak for themselves\nand they are undeniable proof of the neverending adventure of discovering and getting\nto know oneself. One could argue that we\u2019re\nall quasi-patriots, selfish people, brutes\nand cowards until we prove with our actions\nthat we are patriots, unselfish and generous\npeople, civilized human beings and heroes.\nUnpretentiously put, we are neither \u2013 simply\nbecause we haven\u2019t lived enough to be able\nto tell the tale that proves either extreme.\nWhat to do then? How about you jump off\na cliff mate, and find out?\n1\n*Cough*, Life Sciences, *cough*.\nN\naida Dzigal\n\u201cNot all TV is of\nthe vapid variety.\nIt is brilliant\nfor facilitating\nconversation\u201d\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Clarke\u2019s Childhood\u2019s End\nlast term in the Arts section in which I\nannounced it to be my favourite book.\nSince then I\u2019ve had a chance to read\nsome more of his work, which has cemented my opinion of him as one of history\u2019s finest science fiction authors. This\nweek I\u2019d like to review, The Fountains\nof Paradise, the latest of his novels I\u2019ve\nhad the pleasure of reading.\nProbably one of the most \u2018hard SF\u2019 of\nClarke\u2019s novels, it is set in the 22nd century and follows the attempts of Dr Vannevar Morgan to build the world\u2019s first\nspace elevator on the island of Taprobane, a fictionalised Sri Lanka. Clarke\nlived more than half his life in the country and his passion for it shines through\nthe text. He has kept much of the island\u2019s fascinating history unchanged,\none of the highlights of the novel.\nThat is not to say that the main thrust\nof the story, the political and technical\ndifficulties of constructing the elevator,\nare any less interesting. They are presented to the reader in Clarke\u2019s usual\nclear, engaging style and each one has\nsatisfying and believable solutions.\nThe book is very story driven. Indeed,\nI have read critics complaining about\nClarke\u2019s poor character development.\nWhile I did once spend half of a Clarke\nnovel thinking that a male character was\na woman I still have to take issue with\nthis complaint. Clarke\u2019s genius is in\ncoming up with engaging stories and the\nonly purpose of his characters is to drive\nthem forward. If these characters were\nany more developed they would simply\nbe a distraction and the very direct writing often still allows us to become emotionally attached to them.\nThe Fountains of Paradise shares a\nremarkable optimism about the future\nwhich can be found in many of his\nworks, with humanity overcoming its\ndifferences and coming together for a\ncommon goal. This does lead to paucity\nof interpersonal conflict and traditional\n\u2018action\u2019scenes. I find this vastly refreshing and an interesting contrast with most\nmodern fiction.\nThis novel is certainly more consistent\nthan Childhood\u2019s End. While the latter\u2019s\nending was somewhat spoiled by its unnecessary description of an alien planet,\nwhich almost strayed into fantasy, here\nit was brilliantly executed: managing\nto be a poignant account of both the\ngreat triumph and failure of Dr Morgan.\nWhether because of its truly intriguing\nmystery, or because it was my introduction to Clarke, I still consider Childhood\u2019s End to be the better book and\nthe best he has written. However, this\ndoes not take anything away from the\nbrilliance of The Fountains of Paradise\nand it remains, along with the majority\nof Clarke\u2019s work, far superior to most\nother science fiction.\nImprove your memory by nodding off\nResearch has revealed how the replaying\nof memories while we are awake leaves\nthem vulnerable to interference and dis-tortion. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, showed that\nby reactivating these memories during\nour sleep, they are protected from this\nmanipulation, particularly during slow\nwave sleep (SWS). SWS occurs in stages\n3 and 4 of non-REM sleep, and we will\nnormally SWS in periods of longer than\n20 minutes, or extended power naps.\nIn this study, volunteers were required\nto remember the locations of pairs of\ncards, officially referred to as a concen-tration-type game. Whilst playing, the\nvolunteers were exposed to an unspecified unpleasant smell. After this admittedly tiring game, half of the volunteers\nspent 40 minutes awake whilst the\nothers curled up and took a 40-minute\nnap. Some volunteers, both awake and\nasleep, were again exposed to the smell\nin an attempt to reactivate their memory\nof the card game. After the 40 minutes\nwere up all of the volunteers played the\ngame one more time and then their ability to recall the original pairs of cards\nfrom the first game was tested.\nThose volunteers who hadn\u2019t had their\nmemory jogged by the odour, whether\nawake or asleep, were able to remember\naround 60% of the original card pairs.\nAn interesting result came from those\nvolunteers whose memories had been\nreactivated with the smell. Those who\nhad foregone the nap and stayed awake\nfor 40 minutes were only able to remember around 41% of the card pairs. Their\nmemories, having been reactivated\nwhilst they were awake, were vulnerable\nto interference probably from the second\ngame of \u2018pairs\u2019. Those volunteers whose\nmemories had been jogged during their\nsleep successfully recalled the location\nof 84% of the original pairs. Brain scans\ntaken during the research revealed how\nmemory replay during SWS involves\nmuch stronger activity in the hippocampus (a structure in the brain strongly associated with memory formation) where\nshort term memories are transferred\nto be stored as long term memories in\nthe cortex. Replaying memories during\nthese periods may speed up the transfer\nfrom long to short-term memory, stabi-lising it.\nThe research scientists, from various\nGerman and Swiss universities, believe their findings may have important\nclinical implications, namely those of\nimproving psychotherapy techniques.\nIt is suggested that these results mean\nthat contextual cues presented during\nAlthough dogs are surely the first animals to be domesticated, the history and\nlocation of wolf-to-dog evolution has\nbeen controversial. Yet recent genetic\nevidence points to the Middle East. Most\nfarmyard animals and the house cat were\ndomesticated in the Middle Eastern area\nknown as the Fertile Crescent, as a result\nof that area being witness to the first sed-entary, agricultural human settlements.\nIt has been thought that wolf domestication was an exception, considering\nthat they are highly mobile predators\nwho scavenged kills left by game-hunt-ing nomads since the Palaeolithic. The\nhypothesis was that wolves became\naccustomed to human contact and that\ngradually a domesticated dog evolved.\nA recent study, however, compared\narchaeological with genetic data, indicating that the emergence of small\ncanids did occur in the Middle East\nwith the wolf-dog barrier crossed at\nthe time of first human settlement. The\nauthors identified a genetic variant in\ndog chromosome 15, found in all small\ndogs but absent in larger and wild dogs.\nThis small-dog haplotype was found\nto be most closely related to the one in\nMiddle Eastern wolves which indeed\nsuggests this was the area of domesti-cation.\nThe earliest archaeological dog remains were also found in the Fertile\nCrescent, which has led to a general\nspeculation that domestication occurred\nbetween 13,000 and 17,000 years ago.\nThis correlates with a social shift in the\nlocal human population, the Natufians,\nfrom being Palaeolithic nomadic hunt-er-gatherers to developing relatively\nsettled agro-economies in the Neolithic,\nsuggesting human settlement played a\nmajor role in dog evolution.\nDomestication is the product of both\nbiological and cultural processes. The\ninitial contact between humans and\nwolves was likely initiated by the scavenging wolves, although there must\nhave been a tolerance of wolves among\nhumans, followed by the settled human civilisation keeping proto-dogs\nwho would scavenge the local rubbish\ndumps. In addition, it is known that\nmodern tundra wolves do not interbreed\nwith their boreal cousins although they\noverlap geographically. It is thought that\ntheir differing lifestyles promote this reproductive isolation, which is perhaps\nprecisely what happened when proto-dogs and wolves diverged.\nThese small garbage-scavenging\nwolves may even have been protected\nby humans for their beneficial service\nby barking at the approach of larger wild\nwolves, alerting the villagers of potential dangers. These behavioural divergences may have further divided the two\npopulations genetically. And why did\ndomestication favour shrinking in size?\nSmaller body-size has the advantage of\nreducing energy demands, and probably\nenabled individuals to \u2018fit in\u2019 better with\ntheir human companions.\nSubsequently, humans encouraged\nmatch-making of the small dogs, preserving their cuddliness, and later on\nexploiting their pint-sized functionality,\nsuch as for ratting or entering burrows.\nAlso, the \u2018shrinking\u2019 evolutionary process would be maladaptive in the wild\nconsidering the disadvantage it poses\nagainst the larger wild counterparts, and\nwas thus probably selected under human\ninfluence. Early human communities\nmust thus have been stable over many\ngenerations to enable this development\nof small dogs.\nLastly, wealth can be material, social\nor knowledge-based, but material wealth\nis the most transmissible form, hence a\npromoter of social inequality. The archaeological presence of domesticates\ncan be an important indicator of when\ninequality of societal wealth began, especially considering that dog ownership\nwas perhaps the first \u2018living capital\u2019.\nHumans would exploit their predatory\nabilities and territorial proclivities to\nincrease their hunting success, but dogs\nalso probably became a status symbol\nas well as being useful. The tamed dog\ncould have perhaps been at the forefront of the innovations that gave rise to\ncommunity structure and gradually the\nspread of urban life.\nFrom wild wolves to top dogs\nNathan Wren\nVictoria Bignet\nMaciej Matuszewski\nwakefulness may be able to reactivate\nunwanted or maladaptive memories\nduring psychotherapy, in patients with\npost-traumatic stress or panic disorder.\nBeing able to reactivate these unwanted\nmemories before therapy may allow\ntraumatic memories to be \u2018unlearnt\u2019 and\nreplaced with \u2018new\u2019 memories. Reactivation of these new memories during\nperiods of SWS could then stabilise\nthese new therapeutic memories within\nthe brain of the patient.\nI wonder if this lady will remember to pick up next week\u2019s issue of Felix...\nEvidence suggests baby wolves used to be just as cute 13,000 years ago\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

It was a\nthrowback to an era\naround 5 years ago when\nAbramovich spent over \u00a3200 million\nbringing some of the best players in the\nworld to Chelsea. Players like Drogba\nand Anelka, who remain in the team but\nwill soon have to leave or retire. Their\nplan to sustainably build up the team\nusing their youth products has all but\nfailed, with 71 million spent on established players and Sturridge and Kakuta\nbeing shipped out on loan to Bolton and\nFulham respectively. This change in policy has no doubt been brought on by the\ndownturn in form seen recently.\nIn the past 2 summers, Chelsea have\nshown a much more prudent approach\nto the transfer market than during\nAbramovich\u2019s early years. For exam-ple, last summer only Benayoun and\nRamires were signed, while players\nlike Ballack, Joe Cole and Deco left, no\ndoubt lowering the club\u2019s wage budget\nsomewhat. However, even with this ap-proach, Chelsea announced a 70 million\nloss during the last financial year. With\nthis in mind many may question Chelsea\u2019s late spending spree.\nAnother downside is the upcoming financial fair play regulations that UEFA\nare set to impose. These rules basically\ndemand that every club must balance\nits income and expenditures, presumably with the intention of preventing\na club from financially collapsing in\nthe way that Portsmouth or Leeds did.\nIt also means that clubs like Man City\nwill have to spend less on players and\neffectively removes from the game the\nidea of a side of \u2018galacticos,\u2019 where a\nclub can spend beyond what they make\nto bring superstars into the team. These\nrules are generally accepted as a measure to keep clubs financially healthy,\nit also is seen to even out the game, allowing smaller sides to be more com-petitive. Although this is generally seen\nas a good thing, with the model of Arsenal taken as an example, I see it as a\nbad thing.\nFurthermore, I am completely in favour of the steps Abramovich and Ancelotti have taken. The signing of Torres\nwill generate increased ticket revenue as\nmore fans will want to see Chelsea sporting this prize asset, and shirt sales for\nshirts with Torres\u2019 name, for example,\nwill make the club money. In addition,\nwhile club success is a priceless factor,\nthere are also huge monetary benefits.\nThis signing could propel Chelsea to a\nhigher league position and to European\nsuccess, both of which spell a huge benefit for the club\u2019s finances.\nHowever, I feel that while every club\nis now a business, having clubs regulate\nthemselves as such takes something\nout of the game for me. Perhaps it is a\nsense of romance, as club owners can\nno longer part with money to assemble\na dream team that could be legendary.\nWhile it could be argued that many\nlegendary teams are built from youth\nplayers, for example Milan\u2019s legendary defence which was made up of all\nItalian players (Maldini, Costacurta,\nBaresi and Tassotti), 3 of whom were\nfrom Milan\u2019s youth system, I think few\ncan deny, for example, that Real Madrid\u2019s big spending at the turn of the\ncentury, capturing Beckham, Zidane,\nRonaldo and so on caused excitement\namong football fans as have Man City\u2019s\nrecent big spending ways. People often\ncomplain about transfer fees and large\nwages but I find this hard to understand.\nFor example, the 50 million that Torres\ncost and his alleged 175k a week wage\nseem excessive but if he was bought for\na smaller fee and given a smaller wage,\nall it would mean was more money\nresting in the account of a Russian oil\nbaron, not better lives for the working class. At least the spending is done\nin a way that provides entertainment\nfor millions upon millions of football\nfans. If someone has a vision for their\nclub, and can afford to contribute these\namounts without even worrying about\nmaking money, it seems unfair to say\nthat they can\u2019t and regulate it.\nTherefore, I feel that it is cynical and\nsad to see the game controlled on the\ngrounds of finances, and even if some\nmay not agree, I\u2019m quite sure that many\nfootball fans are extremely excited to\nsee a world class talent like Torres fit\ninto the Chelsea system.\nChelsea,\nFinances and\nFinancial Fair Play\nRiaz Agahi\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Defending reforms for England, he told\nthe BBC it was right to start now and\nchange was being done \u201csteadily\u201damid criticism it is being done too fast.\nThe heads of six health unions, including the BMA, have warned of their \u201cextreme concerns\u201d about greater commercial competition between the NHS and\nprivate companies.\nWhat we are witnessing is a major shift of how the NHS system runs.\nWhen it was created in 1948 it was centrally controlled. Now the government\nwants most of the responsibility to be\nshifted to consortiums of GPs. The idea\nis to restructure the NHS so that it will\nbe much like how the telecoms industry\nwas broken up. In the near future GPs\nwill be buying services from providers\nfor their patients. The government and\nother bodies agree that many of these\nservice providers will be closed down\nand conglomerated with others.\nThe NHS also needs to have 15-20\nbillion pounds of \u2018efficiency savings\u2019\nall before the next general election. The\ngovernment also want to drastically improve public health so that local government and communities can provide\ninnovative, dynamic methods to solve\nlifestyle-driven diseases.

Where has it gone?\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for the public to realise that the NHS or for any public ser-vice, that it is not free to run and that it\nis all paid for by every tax payer in this\ncountry. Perhaps if we realised that more\noften and appreciated the benefits, more\nof us would be voicing our opinions on\nwhy our culture of binge drinking, unprotected sex and obesity is so prominent in this country.\nIt is not fair to see patients whose\nwhole life has been unpleasant and are\non the organ transplant waiting list, to\nwitness a healthy, irresponsible patient\nacquiring an organ because they overdosed while enjoying themselves, leaving the NHS to foot the bill to rectify the\ndamage.\nThere is a famous phrase: Prevention\nis better than a cure. I believe research\nis still vital for possible remedies, but\nperhaps we should try understanding more why the public do make the\nchoice of abusing their health and try\nrectifying the situation before it is too\nlate.\nAll I can say is that perhaps if we are\nto change the system so much, more\ntime needs to be implemented to allow\neverything to be more closely scrutinised to make sure of its importance.\nPerhaps we could get a little lesson from\nother countries such as Sweden.\nIn the meantime, public perception is\nparamount to being altered. All medical\nprofessionals advise us to look after our\nown body; by doing that we will respect\nothers. Perhaps it may even remedy other social issues such as crime caused by\ncentive for those who are least likely to\nchange their habit.\nWhat is intriguing is that the majority of the health bodies still support the\nplanned changes mainly to the NHS.\nHowever they do believe that the timeline set for 2013 is far too concise for a\nmajor overhaul.\nRecently the head of the Royal College of GPs and the Head of the BMA\nsaid that this whole re-structuring was\nunnecessary. Simple tweaks like the\nnumber of clinicians representing the\nPrimary Care Trust board would pave\nthe way for the NHS to be what the government aims. Unfortunately the government dismisses it replying it would\nonly create more bureaucracy. In the end\nwho do we trust?\nI believe that re-structuring the NHS\nis ideal if and only if the majority of\nthe medical profession believe that with\ngiven time what is planned out actually\ncan make a difference.\nIn 2002, the Wanless report stated that\nwe had to invest more money into the\nNHS and we did under Labour. But there\nwas a critical point. It had to be spent\nwisely and have constant up-to-date\nreports on its improvement especially\nproductivity. If it went well, then after\n2020 for every 10 pounds we have in our\npocket, 1 will go to the NHS. If however\nit went wrong, it will be in every 8 quid.\nAfter spending had arisen productivity\nwas actually falling, as stringent checks\nbecame fewer. It seems this restructure\ncould be ideal.\nWhat I am concerned about is, with\nso many government alterations, I can\u2019t\nhelp but wonder if we are missing the\nThe suicide of a young Tunisian salesman last month could well change the\nworld\u2019s political scene. In much the\nsame way that Paris sneezed and Europe\ncaught a cold, which lead to (admittedly\nslow) liberal reform in the nineteenth\ncentury, Mass political protest in Tunisia has triggered popular movements\nthroughout North Africa and the Near\nEast, much of it planned on Facebook,\nTwitter and Internet forums.\nThe reactions were relatively posi-tive. While some attempts at controlling\nthe populace through the usual despotic\nmethods were made (including \u201cturning\noff\u201d the internet in Egypt\u2019s case), most of\nthe affected leaders realise this will not\nwork, having seen Tunisian president\nBen Ali flee the country. Instead, Egyptian president Mubarak has promised to\nto the events of 1978 in Iran, which\nlead to the fall of the Shah. The corrupt\nand oppressive regime was replaced\nwith a \u201crepublic\u201d, but on an Islamic\nrather than liberal model. This system\nof government may provide a slightly\nhigher standard of living and greater\nrights to its citizens than the totalitar-ians. However, its people are far from\nfree and its views are so at odds with\nthe liberal model that it can cause greater international instability; at the most\nextreme leading to a \u2018clash of civilisations\u2019 or perhaps a new cold war. Iran\nand Israel have already expressed their\nrespective hopes and concerns that any\ncountries which do collapse will adopt\nthis system.\nThe evidence so far would suggest this\nis not an overreaction, particularly in the\ncase of Egypt. Like the Shah, Mubarak\u2019s\ncritics accuse him not only of corrup-not seek re-election and King Abdullah\nII of Jordan dismissed his entire cabinet\nand brought in former Prime Minister\nMaruf Bakhit to introduce real political\nreform. Other leaders in the region have\nbeen preparing similar moves and, in the\ncase of Sudan\u2019s Omar al-Bashir, emphasising democratic credentials.\nThe calls for the right to determine\ntheir leaders and less corruption seem\npromising. In European minds, it is perhaps reminiscent to the Polish Solidarity\nmovement which successfully pushed\nfor the collapse of Soviet \u2013style totalitarian Communism in Eastern Europe.\nThis is however a dangerous comparison to make. Calls for democracy\nare not the same as calls for liberty;\nas demonstrated by the need to have\nbroad constitutions and supreme courts\nin modern republics.

The main opposition movement in Jordan is an Islamic one, promoting the holistic model of Islam instituted by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran\nsome thirty years ago.\nHowever, this is not to say that all is\nlost for the liberal West. The protests in\nmany countries are still at a very early\nstage. As shown by the protests in Iran\nlast year, they may come to nothing and\npro-Mubarak supporters in Egypt have\nstaged equally powerful and violent\n\u201cIt is reminiscint of\nthe Polish Solidarity\nmovement\u201d\ncounter-demonstrations.

    "content": "FELIX 23\nARTS\nTwisted, but is it\ntwisted enough?\nA seemingly endless tapestry of postcards greets visitors to the latest Gilbert\n& George exhibition at White Cube. The\naesthetic quality of the show is tangible\nfrom the start, even when one is not\nquite sure of the content of the pictures.\nThe overall effect is that of giant, mul-ticoloured quilts that cover the walls of\ntwo rooms. And then you get closer to\nthe pictures; and each one is a surprise.\nEach picture is comprised of thirteen\nidentical postcards arranged in the shape\nof a square urethra. The creation of the\n\u2018Urethra Postcard Pictures\u2019 was an automated process. Once thirteen identical\nflyers or postcards had been collected,\nthey were simply arranged and the title\nwas taken from something within the\npostcard to describe the picture. The\ntitles of the pictures are works of art on\ntheir own and sound like poetry. Their\nbeauty lies in their simplicity and their\nusefulness in describing each work as\nfully as possible.\nThe urethra symbol was not randomly\nchosen as a scandalous geometric arrangement for postcards. It is a sexual\nsymbol and a representation of libertarianism \u2013 very simply put, the freedom of\nexpression, ideas and actions. The urethra appears to free the meanings held\nwithin the ordinary postcard.\nSome of the postcards are taken from\nflyers found mainly in London telephone boxes. The flyers advertise sexual\nservices from rent-boys, prostitutes and\n\u2018masseurs\u2019 as well as performance enhancing drugs and sexual education. You\nwould probably not blink twice at them\nin a normal situation. Arranged in the\nurethra symbol, the postcards are freed\nfrom the constraints of seediness and the\nmundane. The flyers become something\n\u2013 shocking, sad, wistful, sometimes funny \u2013 whatever you imagine really; but a\ndistinct connection to the reality of the\nLondon underworld.\nThe \u2018Union Flag Picture Postcard\nRoald Dahl. Aside from traumatic experiences in chocolate factories and child\neating giants, surely that kindly figure\nlooking out from the back of his books\nwas as child friendly as they get? Short\nanswer: he wasn\u2019t. There was another\nside that many are less aware of, his\nanthologies of short stories directed towards a far more adult audience. Some\nof these stories have now been adapted\nfor the stage in Roald Dahl\u2019s Twisted\nTales. Gone are the Oompa-Loompas,\nand all that\u2019s left are tales of revenge and\na disembodied optic nerve.\nAdapted by Jeremy Dyson, member of comedy group The League of\nGentlemen and self proclaimed fan of\nthe works of Roald Dahl, Twisted Tales\npresents five of Dahl\u2019s short stories and\nprovides an overarching narrative linking them, leaving a more than able cast\nto portray a real bevy of characters, capturing all manners of grotesqueries.\nSet in the 1950s, the play takes the\nform of a story read by a child, about a\ntrain of stoic commuters whose lives are\naffected by an enigmatic stranger who\ndelights in entering day after day and\nimparting a range of tales, all of which\nunfold before our eyes.\nThe decision to present separate stories may have perhaps worked better\nhad the tone of them been more consis-tent. Although all five tales provide a\nshowcase of human cruelty, the stories\nthemselves vary dramatically from humorous to darkly sinister. Indeed with\nDahl\u2019s penchant for dark humour, I was\nhoping that this would be more akin to\nDyson\u2019s recent all-out scarefest Ghost\nStories, which he co-wrote and directed.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that the play isn\u2019t\nfrightening, indeed, when it reaches the\nright balance of unsettling terror and\nhumour towards the end, it\u2019s thrilling.\nOne Jamaican set tale details a wager\nbetween a brash young American and a\nsinister Spaniard involving a lighter, a\ncleaver and a little finger. The audience\ngasped collectively throughout. Spine\nchilling stuff \u2013 I loved it.\nThe set design does an excellent job\nof dealing with the ever changing narra-tive, with a revolving stage ushering in\nnew environments and characters quickly and ensuring that the pace is kept\nhigh. At 80 minutes, it definitely doesn\u2019t\noverstay its welcome, especially with\nsome terrific payoff towards the climax.\nYou can tell that there is both a great\ndeal of appreciation for Dahl\u2019s tales in\nall aspects of the production, and after a\nshaky start they are really done justice,\nleading to one distinctly child unfriendly\nstory that goes out on a high.\nLyric, Hammersmith until 26th Feb\nPictures\u2019 are produced using tourist\npostcards of quintessentially British\nand eternally recognisable subjects. The\nbuildings and symbols of London are\nthrust out of the pictures and almost literally into our faces. The commonplace\npostcard turns into a representation of\nLondon from the outside. There is none\nof the grime of the \u2018Flyer Pictures\u2019 and\nthe \u2018London Telephone Box Card Pictures\u2019in these, but perhaps more of what\nis artificial and yet on display for everyone to see.\nCindy Sherman\u2019s current photo installation at the Spr\u00fcth Magers gallery is an\nexcellent and thought provoking companion to the Gilbert & George show.\nSherman gives us larger than life photographs of herself in fairytale costumes\nagainst the slightly macabre backdrop of\na 19th Century Central Park. As much\nas the \u2018Urethra Postcard Pictures\u2019 regurgitate London\u2019s hidden identities, Sherman\u2019s work is equally about American\nidentity and some of its apparently sin-Gilbert & George wish you were here\nMatt Colvin\nEva Rosenthal Mena\nWeird imaginings of Roald Dahl mashed up with the equally weird ones of Jeremy Dyson, what could go wrong?\nAlastar Muir\nister sexual undercurrents. The artwork\nitself, without going into any deep or\nconvoluted meaning, is very weird,\nwonderful and definitely something to\nsee in itself.\nWhite Cube gallery until 19th Feb\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Here\u2019s how we responded:\nWe agree that highly accredited sponsor\ninstitutions should be allowed to offer\nbelow degree level courses, but that\nthese institutions should be given 1-2\nyears to become highly accredited.\nWe agree that we the Government should\nraise the minimum English requirement\nfor entry.\nCharlotte Ivison\nDeputy President (Welfare)\nWe disagree with the proposal that if\nstudents want to remain in the country\nto study an additional course after their\nfirst one, that they should have to provide\nevidence of academic progression, as\nthis would limit those who choose to\nswap degrees or do a second, unrelated\ndegree.\nWe also disagree will the proposal that\nsuch students should have to leave the\nUK and re-apply from overseas.\nWe disagree with the proposal to close\nthe Tier 1 Post Study Work route. This\nroute allows students to stay in the U.K.\nfor two years after their course to find\nskilled work, and so closing it would\nmean that the only route left is the Tier\n2 migrant route, which only permits the\nstudent to stay for four months during\nwhich they must find a sponsor employer\nto be able to stay and work.\nWe disagree with the proposal to further\nreduce the 20 hours a week limit for full\ntime overseas student employment.\nWe disagree with the proposal that\nstudents on a course of 12 months or\nunder should not be able to bring family\nwith them, and that any family members\npermitted should not be allowed to work\nhere.\nWe agree that track records of\nfraudulence in individual countries and\nin sponsor institutions should be used\nas a basis for differential examination of\napplication documents.\nIt\u2019s expected that the results of this\nconsultation should come out in April.

In\na pathetic attempt to \u201cdevelop\u201d handball\nin the country, only teams with 3 British\nplayers or more are allowed to enter the\ntournament and a plate competition is\nhelp simultaneously for all the unreasonably multicultural Universities who accurately reflect the democratic make-up of\nHandball players in Great Britain.\nFueled by their outrage and in order to\nbe able to play competitive games with\nother like-minded teams, 5 University\ndelegations came together in Leyton to\nplay a self-organised tournament. As all\nthe squads present will be represented in\nthis so-called \u201cPlate Cup\u201d in Nottingham,\nit was a good indicator of what Imperial\nFencers wipe the floor\nat BUCS league\nis capable of this year, after they already\nwon some silverware in 2010.\nIn the first match, Imperial had to face\nOxford University, who failed to trouble\nthe Eagles in the development League\nlast season and continued to do so on this\noccasion. It might have been due to that\nfact that some players were forced to play\nin their underwear after the player in possession of the IC kit was rendered to miss\nthe first game on grounds of a hangover,\nbut Oxford seemed almost unwilling to\nexert any pressure on the solid defense\nand could not prevent the Eagles from\nsetting up countless chances in attack,\nwhich were reliably converted, securing\nthe opening victory.\nThe next opponent was Warwick, who\ndid manage to narrowly defeat Imperial\nin the League on two occasions last sea-son. Motivated by the arrival of the kit\nand the hung-over spectator who delivered it, the Eagles were quick to establish what should have been a comfortable\nlead. However, a lack of concentration\nand some truly awful goalkeeping gave\nthe visitors hope and even a chance to\nwin the game in the last minutes. Luckily the Warwick playmaker thought that\nHandball:\nEagles win\nfirst title of\nthe season\nThe second and final weekend of Men\u2019s\nand Women\u2019s, BUCS Southern Premier\nLeague took at place at Ethos on the\n28th-29th January. Going into the weekend both Imperial teams looked strong\ncontenders for their respective titles, being undefeated in the first weekend. Expectations on further victories were high\nand winning the league was the goal ev-Stefan Bauer\neryone was aiming for.\nSaturday started with the Men\u2019s 1st\nTeam facing University of London, the\nteam ranked second behind IC in the\nleague. The sabreurs (Maiyuran Ratneswaran, Henry Gann, Didier Nohlmans, Camille van Hoffelen) gave the\nteam a good head start with a victory\nof 45-24. Sadly followed by a defeat\nfor the foilists (Robert Shaw, Chris Gilliam, Ed Collier and Sami Start), to a\nmuch stronger foil team, but the match\nwas easily decided by a victory from the\nepee team (Ed Gilhead, Marcello Colombino, Miles Gandolfi).\nWhilst the guys finished their match,\nthe girls started fencing their foil match-es. Kings University did not show up\ndue to illness, which meant that there\nwere only 3 matches to fence in each\nweapon.

    "content": "GAMES\n\u201c \u201d\nFELIX 33\nCreate Chains reward players for doing certain things in certain places in a scene, like putting textures in a specific area or filling a specific place with objects. While this certainly helps\nto guide players along the process of custom-ising a scene from start to finish, the requests\ntend to end up saying \u2018I suggest you place this\nobject here\u2019, further limiting the imagination.\nFor example, when the chain says \u201cplace down\nsome objects\u201d and it picks an area that\u2019s just\nbeen decorated as runway, no-one\u2019s going to\nslap a 1920s steam engine down on the gleaming tarmac. Once you\u2019ve done what the game\nasks you\u2019re whisked away to somewhere dif-ferent, which is in itself annoying as it doesn\u2019t\ngive time to properly rotate or scale the last object before being dragged away from it.\nAlthough players might not be able to be\nthat creative, the game artists certainly were.\nGraphics are a strong point in Create and the\ngame looks great from start to finish, even on\na low-end system. The huge backgrounds are\nhigh-resolution and detailed, and breathe colour and life into the scene, and the visual ef-fects, like the confetti that can be made to fall\nfrom the sky, manage to remain visually interesting whilst not getting in the way. The user\ninterface has some usability flaws, but again it\nstill looks nice while it blocks the view.\n\u201cSurely when providing\ncreative tools the utmost\nshould be done to not\nlimit the creativity?\u201d\nW\nhen Create was first an-nounced, it was a dream\ncome true. Electronic Arts,\ncreators of The Sims series,\nwere making a new kind\nof creation-simulation game. No mention of\nhouses or families \u2013 yes, they were finally making The Sims without the Sims! At last, players\ncould build a house (or anything!) and not have\nto deal with the monotonously boring lives of\nthe simulated little people afterwards; just pure,\nunbridled creativity.\nAnd yet, despite promising all this, even the\nmost determined of gamers could be forgiven\nfor failing to like the finished product. Create is\na far cry from the quality of The Sims 4, instead\nit\u2019s a mix of creative tools and gameplay elements that don\u2019t really work well together. So\nwhy does a game that seemed to have so much\npromise, turn out so unashamedly mediocre?\nCreate should certainly be lauded for its simplicity \u2013 the purpose of the game is exactly what\nwould be imagined. Create presents the player\nwith an empty \u2018scene\u2019 \u2013 a set of platforms,\nwalls and rocky outcrops \u2013 and then hands\nover the tools to decorate it and fill it with stuff,\nranging from grass and flowers to rollercoast-ers and jumbo jets. Objects can be rotated and\nscaled up, graffiti can be placed on walls and\nscenes can be moved from Himalayan Mountains to bustling cityscapes with a short click\nof the mouse. Initially the choice is limited but\nnew items are unlocked by completing special\npuzzle challenges or \u2018Create Chains\u2019, special\nsequences where players decorate certain places using certain tools.\nHowever, oddly for a game based on creativ-ity, Create also stifles the users creative im-pulses. Although there\u2019s free reign over where\nobjects are placed, the architectural elements\nand theme of a scene are not modifiable; players are limited to creating scenes based around\ncertain topics, such as \u2018theme park\u2019, \u2018transport\u2019\nor \u2018Halloween\u2019. This seems counter to the\npremise of Create. Surely the utmost should\nbe done to not the limit the player\u2019s options?\nPlayers want to choose where the natural rocks,\nwalls and tunnels go, not have some schmuck\npick them out and leave the player to fill in the\nrest. The whole \u2018scene\u2019 concept is silly too:\nrather than being an empty landscape to fill up\nas desired it\u2019s more like a tableau of objects\nand textures pasted onto random pedestals and\nramps. It\u2019s impossible to make anything remotely credible and this totally ruins the whole\n\u2018make-what-you-like\u2019 concept.\nHaving to unlock things is a nice idea and\nit certainly gives the game more of a purpose,\nbut it\u2019s a massive disappointment for people\nwho actually do want to decorate the scenes.\nFor some weirdo who says, \u201dAh man, I\u2019ve got\nthis sweet idea for a graveyard scene,\u201d actually\nreaching the appropriate Halloween level and\nunlocking all the right objects takes a trudge\nthrough 10-20 hours of creating other stuff first.\nThis is really annoying for anyone who genuinely wants to use the tools on a scene of their\nchoice; creativity is no fun when it\u2019s forced.\nEA\u2019s creatively challenged\nDespite being nothing new in the world of\ngaming, the puzzles are actually Create\u2019s redeeming feature. Each level comes with eight\nor so challenges that require players to use a\nselection of interactive objects to fulfil a goal,\noften moving an object from one place on the\nstage to the other. The puzzles vary in complexity from the (deceptively) simple \u2018knock over a\nfirework with a basketball\u2019 to the slightly more\ncomplex \u2018build a robot T-Rex out of candy\nsticks and chewing gum\u2019. Having an epiphany\nand watching it turn into a correct solution is\nfun and satisfying. The challenges start out\neasy but get more interesting later on, and for\nthe serious puzzle fiend more user-created levels can be downloaded from the online gallery.\nThe \u201cContraption-o-matic\u201d puzzles \u2013 where\nbasic building blocks like rods and wheels are\nused to build some kind of vehicle \u2013 also deserve a special mention for keeping the experience fresh.\nBut the challenges also fall foul to one fatal\nflaw that blights so many puzzle games: they\nare just too finicky. With puzzles, the fun is in\nthe solving \u2013 working out what needs to happen\nand then watching it work. The most frustrating\nthing to encounter in a puzzle game is a situation where you know what you need to do but\nsimply can\u2019t get the game to let you do it. Having to position a basketball at a very specific\npoint above a very specifically placed ramp so\nthat it bounces and hits a very specific place on\na rocket makes the simple \u2018firework-basketball\u2019\npuzzle mentioned above a nightmare to actually complete. Any enjoyment taken from the\nchallenge drains fast when met with frustrating,\nchaotic physics that stop a solution working\ndue to sheer arbitrariness, and unfortunately it\nhappens just that little bit too often in Create.\nUnfortunately, I could go on. The challenges\nand the scene are completely disconnected,\nwith challenges taking place on a small stage\nat the front of each level, so much so the two\ncould almost be separate games without the\nother noticing. The puzzles are also wholly in\n2D (or 2.5D, if you want include 3D graphics)\nand, when you boil it down, actually provide a\nsimilar experience to many online Flash games\n(although Create looks much better, of course).\nWhat this all adds up to is a game that doesn\u2019t\nreally know what to do with itself. Creativity\nshould be the order of the day (it\u2019s in the freaking title), but through Create\u2019s critical design\nmistakes the imagination is dragged down to\nthe level of a glorified colouring book. Challenges can be fun but too often are difficult in\nentirely the wrong way. Unlocks are the final\nnail in the coffin, and spoil the game for anyone who does want to decorate the scenes. It\u2019s\na shame, because the concept behind Create is\nstill sound, The Sims without the Sims is still\na good idea. This time, though, EA have gone\nin the wrong direction, limiting the creativity\ninstead of unleashing it.\nCreate is available now from EA and Bright\nLight Studios for PC, Mac, PS3, Xbox 360,\nand Wii.\nSimon Worthington places, pastes and paints to his heart\u2019s content in EA\u2019s Create\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n6\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHigher Fees\nStudent protests pass peacefully\nThousands of student protestors marched on to the\nstreets of London and Manchester once again this\npast weekend, to demonstrate their anger and disapproval of the government\u2019s plans to impose higher tuition fees and introduce public spending cuts.\nThe government has refused to change course on\ntuition fee increases, despite the rising number of\nprotests across the country, and continues to argue\nthat increasing tuition fees is absolutely critical to\nsecure the future of the universities. Students, how-ever, are well aware of the enormous challenge that\nthey face and were full of optimism during the protest as Aisha, a foreign exchange student from Camden was quoted to have said, \u201cThis is only the begin-ning. I\u2019ve been to all demonstrations so far and am\nwell aware of the mountain climb that lies ahead. It\nis going to be a long fight against this government.\u201d\nAccompanied by heavy police, the protest in London remained relatively peaceful in comparison with\nrecent tuition fee marches. However, an aggressive\nattempt was made to force through police lines\nand reach the Tory party head quarters in Millbank,\nwhich resulted in six people being detained. Emotions were at its climax in the three hour long march\nthrough central London to the Parliament, as protestors used drums to amplify the noise and shouted in\nunison, slogans which included: \u201cNo ifs, no buts\u2026\nNo education cuts!\u201d\nConsidering the recent political events in Tunisia\nand Egypt, an interesting analogy was drawn by a\nprotestor when he drew up a placard bearing the\nwords: \u201cBen Ali, Mubarak...Cameron, you are next.\u201d\nThe march in Manchester turned more violent as a\nmob consisting of 150 protestors broke away from\nthe crowd and surrounded Aaron Porter, the President of the National Union of Students, who then\nhad to be escorted away by the police. Personal\nattacks which involved throwing eggs and oranges\nwere also made on Shane Chowen, the Vice president of NUS, when he tried to address and calm\ndown the crowd.\nAssistant Chief Constable Neil Wain of Greater\nManchester Police gave the following official statement to the BBC, when questioned about the disturbances in the Manchester rally: \u201cIn total, we made\n16 arrests and have had reports that two officers\nsuffered minor injuries. We also have intelligence to\nsuggest a number were armed with chef\u2019s knives\nand one of those arrested was found with a number\nof razor blades.\u201d\nIt is pretty evident that the situation continues\nto be really sensitive, and with social networking\nsites becoming increasingly effective with regards\nto publicity, including developments such as a mobile phone application which allows the user to avoid\npolice-blocked routes, the protests can only be expected to increase and become more compelling in\nnature. Umair Aasem\nof high teaching costs.\nAaron Porter has also claimed this week\nthat up to 70% of universities will charge this\nmaximum amount. He argues that \u201cuniversities\nbelieve that the price they set will be a sign of\nquality \u2013 and they will charge whatever they\ncan get away with\u201d.\nHowever, Nicola Dandridge from University\nUK rejects this assumption, saying that universities have not yet made pricing decisions and\nso there is no way of knowing the levels of fees\nthat will be charged.\nAlex Kendall is also keen to stress that \u201cmost\nof the work the group [at Imperial] can do at\nthe moment can only be speculation\u201d until further details from the government are revealed.\nHowever, in his latest blog he has hinted that\nthe working group, of which he is part of, is\ninvestigating both financial models of \u00a36000\nand \u00a39000 fees.\nImperial currently spends around \u00a34 million\non financial aid to students whose household\nincome is below a certain level. A maximum\nbursary of \u00a33500 per year is available for students whose income is less than \u00a325,000, and\na staggered system of reduced bursaries caters\nfor those earning over \u00a325,000. Of the \u00a34 mil-lion, \u00a33.5 million comes from fees which are\nredirected to form bursaries with the other \u00a30.5\nmillion coming from the endowment. Alex\nKendall warns that \u201cwith the cut in government funding the university may not be able to\nafford the \u00a33.5 million given in bursaries unless the government demands it and/or Imperial\ncharges higher fees\u201d.\nKendall highlights the dilemma that the\nworking group are facing between charging\n\u201ca \u00a36000/year fee for everyone, knowing that\nthis will drastically reduce the amount of financial aid, and a \u00a39000 fee so that those with\na large household income pay and everyone\nwhose family earns below \u00a360,000 gets some\nform of subsidy\u201d. He states that the \u00a39000/year\nfee \u201cwith a far greater redistributive system to\npoorer students seems far more preferable than\na system of total equality under \u00a36000/year\u201d.\nKendall has also spoken of discussions that\nhave taken place within the working group regarding how the bursaries will be given out.\nOne option is to continue paying bursary money straight into a student\u2019s bank account, so the\nstudent has freedom to choose how it is spent,\neither for paying fees or for living costs. However, the idea of a fee remission has also arisen,\nwhereby students cannot use the bursary for\nliving expenses, an option Kendall argues\nwould be undesirable. \u201cFor a London univer-sity, we know that the living costs are the most\nexpensive factor at university and the current\nloan and grant only just covers this. Preventing\n[students] from using the bursary to top this up\nis a mistake.\u201d However, there may not be an\noption; Imperial thinks the government may\ndemand the latter, and therefore modeling how\nthis would work at Imperial is now crucial.\nHowever, just when help seems to be on its\nway to poorer students, the think-tank Million+\n\u00a39,000 fees allows more distribution to\npoorer students says Union President\nhas claimed this week that \u201cadding another\nlevel of complexity\u201d to an already complicated\nsystem of student bursaries and grants is unlikely to help those most deprived.\nThey are referring to a \u00a3150 million National\nScholarships Programme announced by the coalition whereby students would have their first\nyear of university paid for by the state if they\nhad been entitled to free school meals. Universities that charge more than \u00a36000/year could\nalso be forced to pay the students\u2019 fees for a\nsecond year.\nCritics argue that this plan would hit universities that take a high proportion of students\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds and act as a\ndisincentive for elite universities such as Imperial to take such students.\nThe think-tank also argues that EU legislation makes it impossible for the government\nand universities to pay the tuition fees of only\nUK students. Eligible EU students would also\nhave to have their fees paid for too. The NUS,\nwhich is involved in consultations on this is-sue, have suggested the government might now\ndrop this plan.\nTherefore, both the government and the Student Fees and Financial Aid Working Group at\nImperial have many considerations to take into\naccount to ensure the new system is \u201cfairer and\nmore progressive\u201d as promised by the coali-tion. The financial aid package will have to be\nsubmitted to and agreed by the Office for Fair\nAccess and Dr. Rodney Eastwood admits that\n\u201cit is unlikely than an announcement on details\nfrom Imperial will be made before the summer\u201d. Finally, students should not be hesitant\nto express their views to Alex Kendall, a member of the working group. Eastwood insists\nthat \u201cstudent views are welcome, especially\non the forms of financial aid that would help\nto attract the most able, but needy, students to\nthe College.\u201d\nSophia David\nMiles Robertson\nThe \u201cStudent Fees and Financial Aid Working Group\u201d in College is discussing Imperial\u2019s\nfuture fee structure and how to make the Queen\u2019s Tower more interesting visually...\nFriday 04 february 2011\n...Continued from Front Page\n\u201cUniversities believe that\nthe price they set will be\na sign of quality \u2013 and\nthey will charge whatever\nthey can get away with\u201d\nAaron Porter,\nNUS President\n\n"

Middle-aged\nskinheads in pork-pie hats and turn-up jeans,\nskanking wildly to a bunch of tunes that found\na recipe that worked in 1980 and have found no\nreason to change it since. Madness release a\nnew album every couple of years, just to show\nwilling, but you\u2019re there to see \u201cBaggy Trousers\u201d and \u201cIt Must Be Love\u201d and Suggs and Co.\nare well aware of it.\nThe set (and the skanking) kicked off with the\nwell-worn \u201cOne Step Beyond\u201d, driving 15,000\npot-bellies into raptures of excitement and airborne beer skiffs. A brief attempt was made\nto introduce an element of sophistication, with\nthe arrival of an elegant, ballgown-clad string\nquartet, but this was immediately subverted\nby a lecherous saxophonist and business was\nresumed as normal. The set was capped by a\nthunderous encore, finishing with \u201cNight Boat\nto Cairo\u201d rolling straight into Monty Python\n\u201cThe Bright Side of Life\u201d as the band\u2019s friends\nand family took to the stage for one last dance\nbefore the end of the long tour.\nIn short, it wasn\u2019t big, it wasn\u2019t clever, but\nit was impossible to leave without a big dumb\nsmile on your face.

This album really\ngrows on you, like many of the Bright Eyes songs,\nand you will find yourself needing the songs to get\nyourself through a wintery day, or to get over a past\ndemon. They\u2019re songs that help you overcome the\nchallenges of life in an unconventional way, often\ndepressing but with a feeling of everyone being in\nit together. Moving away from the established folk\nsound that the band had conquered so well, Bright\nEyes performs to his more indie-rock self, blending\nmarching percussions with the rocks twangs and\nforce. The unforgettable \u2018Shell Games\u2019 is out as a\nfree download and the rest of the album is set to be\nreleased on Conor\u2019s birthday, 15th February!\nLuke Turner\nMost listened to\nthis week by\nFelix Music\nmembers on\nlast.fm\nMake sure not to miss\nGrandmaster Flash!\nScala, King\u2019s Cross\nTonight! (4th February) @ 19.00\nUnquestionably the ambassador of hip-hop since\nthe 1970\u2019s, Grandmaster Flash is a living legend in\nthe industry. Coming from The Bronx, New York, he\nis the creator of many DJ styles including backspin\ntechnique, punch phrasing and although he didn\u2019t\ninvent it, he is the true master of scratching. Originally being a part of Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, masterpiecing such hits as \u2018Freedeom\u2019\nand \u2018The Message\u2019 in the early 1980\u2019s, he has since\ntoured solo spreading his uncomparable knowledge\nof the decks far and wide. He now decides to grace\nthe ever-friendly streets of London and will play at\nScala in King\u2019s Cross on Thursday.

It\u2019s not unpleasant\nby any means, but it\u2019s the kind of inoffensive\nambient music that seems inevitably destined\nto be the backing for an advert, and probably\nfor a mobile phone network.

N-Dubz also get involved, bragging\nabout money and dissing \u201chaters\u201d, and end up\nsounding like the 14-year-olds they cater their\nmusic to, with Dappy deciding to compare\nhimself to Elvis. The beat attempts a back-to-basics minimal approach, but just sounds\nweak. Skepta should leave these poor crossover attempts well alone.

On another level they were playing\nfamiliar music in a completely novel way, employing the kinds of unique instruments usually kept to World music, and far away from\nrock n\u2019 roll.\nTheir music always had a clearly individual\nfeel to it that distinguished it from any other\nblues-rock out there, even to this day. As they\nthemselves surmise in their final press state-ment, their music will live on forever through\ntheir rich discography and through the entire\ngeneration of musicians and fans they inspired.\nThough I am sure there will still be heaps\nof great Jack White-penned tunes coming our\nway in the future, courtesy of Third Man Records, I still could not help but feel a wave of\nbittersweet nostalgia overcoming me as I read\nThe White Stripes\u2019 beautiful final message to\nthe world:\n\u201cThe White Stripes do not belong to Meg\nand Jack anymore. The White Stripes belong to\nyou now and you can do with it whatever you\nwant. The beauty of art and music is that it can\nlast forever if people want it to. Thank you for\nsharing this experience. Your involvement will\nnever be lost on us and we are truly grateful.\u201d\nGreg Power\nAdd the White Stripes\u2019 breakup to the violence in Egypt and there\u2019s only one conclusion that can be arrived at: there\u2019s nothing good in this world anymore...\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Meeting an endless stream of new people\nfrom various countries makes for a large\nnumber of introductions. After you\u2019ve\nsaid hello to the fifteenth German girl\nat the party, whose name you\u2019ve already\nforgotten, the quasi-scripted question-and-answer session begins.\n\u201cSo, where do you live?\u201d Piece of\ncake, you think, I live right next to that\nbig avenue in the city cent.. - wait. Did\nshe mean here, or which country do\nI usually live in? Or even where I\u2019m\nfrom?\nAh. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter any more;\nthe 3-minute silence accompanying my\nthought process made her lose interest.\nI\u2019m sure that pitcher of sangria over\nthere would be happy to hear my answer.\nBut what would my answer have been?\nAs a student, you\u2019ll have at least two\nplaces to call home; obviously there\u2019s\nthe place with the draughty windows\nand dodgy Ikea furniture you\u2019ve occupied for the past six months, but\nthere\u2019s also your parents\u2019 house, which\nis always a pleasure to go back to (for,\nsay, the first 48 hours). Being on a year\nabroad just adds another country to the\nmix, and increases your chances of not\nbeing understood when trying to answer\nthe question.\nDoes it actually matter? Not really.\nI think the question of where you live\nhas become irrelevant. The internet\nand cheap air travel means that you can\nknow what\u2019s going on anywhere in the\nworld as if you were actually there. If\nyou want to, you can conceivably get\nthere in less than a day and for less than\na thousand pounds.\nAll right, a thousand pounds is a lot of\nmoney. Maybe the entire world is still\nout of the reach of your average Imperial student. On a smaller scale, Europe\nis your oyster. Got fifty quid to spare?\nFancy a change of scenery? Get yourself\na Ryanair ticket to Rome, or EasyJet it\nto Prague.\nDistances have practically vanished\nbetween countries; if you\u2019re travelling\ninside the E.U. you barely notice any\nborders at all. You could be in a different\ncountry every six months if you wanted\nto. Naturally, in these conditions, the\nconcept of home starts to blur.\nThis is exacerbated by the internet:\nthanks to Facebook and Skype, I almost get the impression I\u2019m still living\nin London sometimes. Events, banter,\ngossip and even the results of the IC\nFencing team make their way towards\nme through the \u2018intertubes\u2019. The ubiquitous tweet lets me know what a friend\nis thinking, or even gauge the mood of\nLondoners, at any given time.\nThe world is definitely getting small-er, and I can only see that as being a\ngood thing. As people travel more, and\nsee what life is like in other countries;\nas people get used to reading opinions\nfrom halfway around the globe, maybe\npeople will start to cooperate more, and\nwith more meaning.\nIn practical terms, there isn\u2019t much\ndifference between a student flat in Helsinki and one in Barcelona. So, in answer to the question, I don\u2019t know where\nI live. I\u2019ll still have my friends and family close by wherever I choose to be, and\nthat\u2019s what counts to me.\nAlthough I\u2019m just happy to have chosen a place with a beach.\nI\nf popular culture has taught me\nanything (and I like to think\nit has), it is that we are most\nlikely to perish as a species in\na thermonuclear fire-storm or\na zombie pandemic. Though radically\ndifferent, these apocalypses involve\na great deal of mass panic before the\ndying starts. As such, there are themes\ncommon to both that may just dissuade\nbooking any long-term holidays.\nI\u2019m sure there is some kind of national\ninformation service for these things but\nI think most people will get wind of\nthings beforehand. Those hard-wired\ninto the blogosphere and interwebs\nwill pick it up, like any other news, on\nTwitter and Facebook first \u2013 \u201c#OMGZOMBIES is trending on Twitter. Find\nout why.\u201d Those of us with one foot in\nthe present will receive a pertinent text\nmessage from a loved one \u2013 \u201cFallout im-minent. In bunker. Bring biccies. Luv =)\nx.\u201d As such, there will already be micro-panics occurring before the reality hits\nBBC News 24, but only once Huw Edwards is handed the copy-sheet, the real\npanic will begin.\nFeral mobs killing each other over a\ncrate of tinned peaches is quite an Americanised idea. I\u2019m not sure how well it\nwill translate across the Atlantic. Of\ncourse, there will be a rush for all canned\nfoods and bottled water but we will still\nqueue and pay as is proper. There will be\ntraffic chaos on Kensington High Street\nas all the yummy\u2013mummies of Notting Hill swarm the Whole Foods Market, ignoring all the corner\u2013shops they\npassed on the way. The end of the world\nis no time to start developing bad hab-its. Maybe, if we\u2019re in a real pinch, we\nwon\u2019t ask for cash\u2013back. The panic will\nbe evident however in a glut of foot\u2013tapping and sighs of exasperation.\nWith the last ever weekly shop done,\npeople will go out looting. This will be a\ncompetitive affair; people will only loot\nonce their neighbours are home, so they\nknow what they have to beat. Admittedly, surpassing the Jones\u2019 plasma-screen\nHDTV becomes academic once the\nEMP/bloodthirsty horde hits the power\nplants. Imperial students are more practical beings. They will take as many\ntankards as possible from the Union Bar\n\u2013 the beer, however, they will leave.\nThen comes the moment of realising\nthe answers to \u201cIf you could get away\nwith anything, what would you do?\u201d\nWith possibly hours left in existence,\nthe idea of consequences quietly dissolves and traditional morality caves in\non itself. To my female readers, I give a\nwarning: arm yourselves, as heavily and\nby any means possible. Total annihilation can turn people into desperate crea-tures...as if the Imperial student body\nwasn\u2019t desperate enough already. Thinking of it, as an addendum, ladies, buy a\nsafe for your calculators too.\nAt this point, our potential fates di-verge. In the case of nuclear holocaust,\nanyone caught outside of Blackett is\ndead. The end. An undead plague is\nmore perfidious, and there is a strong\npossibility of survivors for several\nweeks at least. Blackett, Queen\u2019s Tower\nand Charing Cross Hospital are all potential sites to hole up in, situated in\ntrendy boroughs of West London, part-furnished, perfect for students and flat-sharers. My advice here is to avoid the\nTube. London Underground is not renowned for its reliability; do you think\nthings will improve after an apocalypse?\nThe Circle Line, at least, will invariably\nbe down.\nNow, this vision of the future may\nseem dystopic to you but I consider it\na win-win situation. I\u2019m an optimist.\nFirstly, if I\u2019m among the countless millions dead, I won\u2019t be too bothered that\nI missed out on the looting. And if I sur-vive, if I\u2019m one of the few who have lost\neverything I hold dear, at least I\u2019m alive\nand I have my health.\nUntil the radiation sickness or zombie\nvirus get me.\nApocalypse Now... please?\n\u201cThe end of the\nworld is no time to\nstart developing bad\nhabits\u201d\n\u201cThe world is\ndefinitely getting\nsmaller, and I can\nonly see that as\nbeing a good thing\u201d\nLetter to the Editor\nDude, where\u2019s my country? Dear Sirs,\nWhile reading last week\u2019s comment piece \u201cScience doesn\u2019t\nplay by its own rules\u201d I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but wonder if the author\nhadn\u2019t confused the scientific\nmethod as an idea and fallible\nhuman culture. She makes the\nobservation that a disproportionate amount of scientists\nare male and concludes that\nthe scientific method itself is\nto blame.\nObviously it is in nobody\u2019s\ninterests if half the human\npopulation are excluded from\nscience but I feel that it is actually arbitrary cultural norms\nthat are to blame.\nIndeed the march of pro-gress, partly achieved by sci-ence, could been seen as the\ncause of greater gender equal-ity. Historically science has\ndemonstrated and popularised\nthe power of reason and evi-dence. It has encouraged people to throw out dogma, tradition and authority as a route to\nknowledge.\nIf you think it\u2019s difficult to be\na woman in science now, imagine if your male counterparts\nstopped you because \u201cIt\u2019s traditional that the woman stays\nat home\u201d or \u201cFor God made\nAdam first, and afterwards he\nmade Eve.\u201d\nFeminists should be using\nreason to our advantage.\nYours,\nJakov Marelic\nThe author responds:\nI don\u2019t believe that I did suggest that the scientific method\nwas to blame.

With most of the day left,\neveryone from IC gathered next to the\nguys\u2019 piste where they were now fencing Oxford University. There were about\n20 people in the audience, consisting\nof both the women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams,\nother club members, coaches, alumni\nand friends, everyone trying to make as\nmuch noise as possible to throw the opponents off guard. This helped the sab-reurs to another easy victory, followed\nby two very even matches in both foil\nand epee. The previous lost their match\nby no less than 3 hits, and epee was even\ncloser with the annoyingly thrilling result 44-45. Despite these annoying de-feats, the overall match was won thanks\nto the points margin from the sabreuers.\nMeaning 2 victories out of 2 for the Men\nand 3 out of 3 for the Women, a very\npromising first day.\nMen\u2019s Fencing\nIC 1st 119-87 ULU\nIC 1st 118-100 Oxford\nIC 1st 130-91 Bristol\nIC 1st 107-103 Cambridge\nWomen\u2019s Fencing\nIC 1st 130-80 Cambridge\nIC 1st 135-74 Oxford\nIC 1st 135-70 Bristol\nIC 1st w/o against King\u2019s\nOn Sunday, the men had a late start,\nwhilst women\u2019s sabre team (Clare Harding, Zoe Robinson, Hannah Bryars) conquered the Ethos Energia Studio. The\nsmall hall on the second floor barely had\ntime to realise what was going on before\nall matches were done, which meant\nthat those who had teams downstairs\nhad time to watch parts of their progress\nand support. With only epee to go, the\nwomen had already won the league. The\nsabreurs index together with the foilists\nperformance the day before summed up\nto victory against all other universities\nregardless of the result of epee.\nThe men still have not started their\nmatches for the day, so most IC support-ers, began supporting UL as they fenced\nUniversity of Cambridge. Not only London solidarity but also a vested interest\nin the result increased the volume of the\nIC cheering. As depending on the result\nof the match, the men could, just as the\nwomen, secure the victory before lunch-time. As UL reached the score necessary\nto win the match, IC were smiling just\nas much, if not more. From that mo-ment, every victory would only be for\nthe pride of our university and the club.\nThe guys started their Sunday well\nby beating University of Bristol with\nreassuring performances in both sabre\nand epee. As they finished their match,\nthe women\u2019s epee team (Emily Bottle,\nCharlotte Levin, Hannah Bryars) were\nbrought back to earth as Cambridge\nbeat them, 40-45. But the matches that\nfollowed were all won with convincing\nmargins of 10 points or more.\nAll that was left the men\u2019s match\nagainst Cambridge. The captains of the\ntwo teams, Ed G for IC and Valentin\nDalibard for Cambridge, had agreed\nupon changing the order from the standard sabre-foil-epee to epee-sabre foil.\nThis meant that sabre this time would\nnot be able to set an early lead for the\nother weapons to fence against, but that\nthey would first have to cover up a possible loss from epee and then get enough\nhits to give the foilists an advantage.\nThe epeeists had to bite the bullet, finding the Cambridge opponents slightly\nstronger than themselves, but the sab-reurs returned the advantage to IC. As\nit stood the foilists had to reach 27 hits\nin order to win the match overall, which\nwas not to be taken for granted but far\nfrom impossible.\nEveryone\u2019s nerves were uptight, fencers as well as audience, well aware of\nwhat lay ahead. The fact that the league\nwas already won barely crossed people\u2019s\nmind, the only thing that mattered was\nto win the match. Cambridge immediately took an early lead and steadily increased their score in every bout. This\nthrew the IC guys off balance, and they\nstruggled to approach the magic number\nof 27. When the match reached its last\nperiod, the score stood at 25-40 and everyone was becoming slightly worried.\nCambridge only needed 5 more hits to\nfinish off, and IC still needed a two more\nto win overall. For every point Rob S,\nwho fenced the last match, managed to\ngain, the crowd cheered more and more.\nThe moment he scored the magical hit,\nthe cheer lifted the roof, and he turned to\nthe crowed, took his mask off for a mo-ment, and sighed with relief. The match\nwas won, so was the league, and both\nteams stood undefeated.\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

That is the sound of\nthe seismic shift in government policy which will\ndefine the higher education\nsector for the next decade. And, worry-ingly, it does not sound good.\nThe 31st of January marked the end\nof the consultation period for the review\nof the student immigration system. The\nproposals outlined by the home secretary Theresa May have been described\nas \u201cradical\u201d, \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d to the university sector, and such\nchanges are expected to have a huge\neffect on the international student body.\nMajor proposals include raising the\nEnglish language requirement, removal\nor reduction of the post study visa and\na radical overhaul of the dependence\nsystem.\nOne of the major frustrations for universities is that under these plans is the\napparent assumption that all degree\ncourses and all students will require the\nsame level of mastery of English.\nUnder the new proposals, students\nwould be expected to achieve a B2\ngrade under CEFR, Common European\nFramework for Languages, in English,\nrather than the previous requirement of a\nB1 grade, roughly comparable to a jump\nfrom GCSE to A-level English. Not\nonly will it be compulsory that overseas\nstudents who are over seventeen demonstrate a higher level of proficiency\nin English than many university undergraduates have done, they will also need\nto do it in a particular \u2018secure\u2019 exam yet\nto be announced by the government.\nThe change will severely affect potential students who intend to study in the\nUK for a few years before applying to\nuniversity here, such as doing A-levels\nor pre-university foundation courses.\nTom Millns, Chief Executive of English\nUK, believes that this is invaluable to\nthe students. He explains that \u201cthey do\nthree things: subject top-up\u201d, \u201cimprove\na student\u2019s English language skills\u201d and\nthey also give students the skills to be\nindependent learners. English UK estimates that around 70-80% of students\nthat are currently on such courses would\nnot be able to satisfy the language re-quirement. At Imperial, around 53% of\noverseas students have studied in the\nUK before applying to university.\nFor current students, the major concern\nis the removal or reduction of the post-study work visa. The two year period on\nthe post study visa is often used to gain\nvaluable work experience and enhance\nthe CV. Dominic Scott Chief Executive\nof UKCISA, UK Council for International Student Affairs, emphasizes how\nimportant the work experience is and\nargues that it demonstrates to potential\noverseas employers \u201cthat their degree\nhas real currency in the labour market\u201d.\nThe proposals will not be welcome\nnews to postgraduate students either. If\nthe plans go ahead in the current form,\nall students under the tier four visas\nwill either not be allowed to bring a dependant if the period of study is under\n12 months, or if the period is over 12\nmonths that dependant will be unable to\nwork. Dominic dismisses the notion as\n\u201cridiculous\u201d and believes that it could\n\u201centirely undermine our research base\u201d.\nThe main reasons behind the proposals are the perceived abuse of the student\nvisa system and the unsustainable mass\nmigration to the UK.\nAs the government tries to fulfil its\npledge to halve net migration by 2015,\nit is easy to see why the government is\nso keen to tighten student immigration\nlaws. The document outlining the proposal quotes a figure of 139,000 of migrants to the UK including dependents\nusing the student route out of 184,000,\naround 76% of total net migration.\nSpeaking to the Guardian on the 1st of\nFebruary, immigration minister Damian\nGreen, argued \u201ctoo many [students]\ncome to do courses below degree level\nas a cover for staying and working\u201d and\nbelieves that the proposals outlined are\nvital to stop abuse of the student immigration system.\nHowever, students do not stay in the\nUK forever and the figure of 139,000\nincludes any person who is planning\nto stay for more than 12 months. A survey of around 1500 students conducted\nby the International Student Barometer\nshowed that just 3% of students were\nintending to eventually settle in the UK\nafter their studies.\nDr Sharon Bolton, Head of International Student Support at Imperial, likens the\ngovernment response to \u201cusing a sledgehammer to crack a nut\u201d. She believes that\na much fairer system would discriminate\nbetween sponsors, institutions which\nFriday 04 february 2011\ncan issue a certificate which is necessary\nwhen applying for a visa via the student\nroute. Sharon argues that since the government already has a ranking system\nof trustworthiness of the sponsors in\nplace , the new immigration laws should\nnot penalise those institutions where no\nevidence of immigration abuse has been\nfoundThere is no exact date for the proposals to be finalised and implemented.\nHowever, the much criticised highly\nskilled worker cap took just 6 months to\nbecome part of the system. As Professor\nEdward Acton, Vice Chancellor of the\nUniversity of East Anglia so dryly ob-serves, if the proposals are not changed,\n\u201cthe catastrophic effects on universities,\nwill for a period, actually make the home\nfees matter slightly fade from centre, so\ngrave will it be.\u201d Comforting.\nImmigration Minister Damian Green (right, obviously...) I can\u2019t wait to be\na ministerial aide, I\u2019m going to protect them from rain \u201cLIKE A BOSS!\u201d\n\u201cProposals include\nraising the English\nlanguage require-ment, removal or\nreduction of the post\nstudy visa and a radical overhaul of the\ndependence system.\u201d\n\n"

Though the company\nkept tight-lipped as to what exactly the event\nwas for, not a single person from journalist to\nfeverish Internet forum-goer was in any doubt\nthat this was to be the day of the official announcement of the oft-rumoured successor to\nthe PlayStation Portable (PSP).\nThe device, along with its official codename\n\u201cNGP\u201d (Next Generation Portable) was announced as expected, and while prior leaks ensured that there were few real surprises to be\nhad, gaming and technology circles have been\nablaze with discussion since the announcement.\nDrawing particular attention has been the\nsystem\u2019s impressive technical specifications.\nThe NGP sports a quad-core ARM Cortex-A9\nCPU backed with a powerful graphics processing unit, which together are capable of producing \u2018near PlayStation 3\u2019 quality graphics in\nreal-time, lovingly displayed on the system\u2019s\nsizeable 5-inch, multi-touch OLED screen.\nIndeed, several demos which were shown\nduring the conference and made available\nfor subsequent hands-on play demonstrated\nthe system\u2019s technical prowess and charmed\nconference-goers.\nDesign-wise, the system is a refinement,\nrather than a complete transformation of its\npredecessor\u2019s sleek curves and black finish.\nThe system is larger, largely due to the aforementioned screen. Answering fans\u2019 prayers,\nSony has replaced the PSP\u2019s much maligned\nanalogue \u2018nub\u2019 with two identical bona fide\ncontrol sticks. This, it is hoped, will alleviate\nmany of the awkward control compromises\nthat were necessitated by many games on the\nPSP, where developers had to find ways of providing control for both player movement and a\n3D camera. Sony hopes that the rounded shape\nof the NGP will fit more comfortably into its\nplayers\u2019 hands.\nFree App of the Week\niOS - HeyTell for iPhone\nEver wanted a walkie talkie type app for your iPhone?\nHeyTell allows you to do just that by sending small\nvoice messages to other users instantly.\nHeyTell isn\u2019t limited to iOS -- Android\u2019s got its own\nHeyTell app too. Send messages to friends whatever\nsmartphone they own. Roger-roger, over and out.\nAndroid - HeyTell for Android\nSony unveils PSP successor\nLouis Constant\nIn the backdrop of the dramatic demonstrations\nsweeping Egypt, another battle is being fought\nfor the control of internet and communication\nlines in the country as the government tries to\nprevent protesters from organising and the local media from distributing images and videos\nof the events to an eager international audience.\nIn an unprecendented step, the government has\ngone as far as ordering ISPs to completely halt\nrouting of all traffic, a move that draws Egypt\ninto an exclusive club of censorship along with\nthe likes of North Korea and Burma.\nThe communications crackdown seems to\nbe a case of too little too late, however, as the\ngovernment seemed unprepared to deal with\nprotests largely organised and planned online.\nEgypt in complete internet blackout\nFeroz Salam\nUnremarkably, all models of the NGP will\ncome with Wi-Fi built-in. More noteworthy\nhowever, is the news that a (presumably more\nexpensive) 3G-enabled version of the NGP will\nalso be produced. No information on data plans\nhave been provided yet, but it is unfortunate to\nnote that speeds offered by 3G will not be adequate to support online gaming from wherever\nthe user happens to be.\nPerhaps the most unusual feature of the NGP\nis a multi-touch panel which has been added\nto the rear of the device, of the same size and\nalignment as the front-facing screen. Some\nspeculation has been paid to the prospect of\nthis panel being used to simulate extra buttons\nor rear triggers, which the NGP lacks. Other\nadditions include both front and rear-facing\ncameras, and a \u201csix-axis\u201d motion detection\nsystem, consisting of a gyroscope and an accel-erometer. Software applications making use of\neither of the cameras were unforthcoming, but\nmotion control was demonstrated in several of\nthe game demos on show.\nNo pricing details were announced, but it\nwas officially stated that the system is to be released in at least one territory before the end\nof this year. It is slightly surprising that Sony\nappears to be following a similar strategy to\nthat which it pursued with the original PSP.\nWith over 60 million units sold worldwide,\nthe PSP has by no means been a failure. Yet\nit failed to match the dizzyingly high sales of\nrival Nintendo\u2019s DS system, which has sold approximately twice this amount in a similar time\nframe. While the abundance of technology in\nthis device is sure to please hardcore gamers, it\nwill also serve to inflate the RRP relative to its\ncompetitor\u2019s, and if the industry\u2019s history is any\nindication, technical superiority is by no means\na recipe for sure fire market success. In any\ncase, the next few years are certainly shaping\nup to play host to a rerun of the infamous DS\nvs. PSP \u201cconsole wars\u201d. Which Japanese giant\nwill reign supreme this time?\nCheck out the Games section next week\nfor more on the device, including the\nrevolutionary PlayStation Suite\nThe ban was enforced merely 12 hours prior\nto the bloody Friday protests, and since then\nmost media organisations have found some\nway of getting around jammed phone networks\nand blocked cables, whether it be relying on\nsatellite connections or old-fashioned dial-up\nthrough the western world.\nThe heavy-handed Egyptian response to\ntechnology savvy citizens using the internet\nto plan demonstrations is a theme familiar to\nmany Middle Eastern states; most countries in\nthe region have highly filtered, slow and centralised services that are closely monitored by\ninternal security services.\nThe knock-on effect of the Tunisian and\nEgyptian riots has caused governments in the\narea to tighten their own regulations, raising\nconcerns of more blackouts to come.\nThe crackdown has cast serious questions\nover the Middle East\u2019s ability to position itself\nas a credible and growing economic power.\nPurely from an economic perspective, a government which cannot maintain reliable communications networks will find it hard to sell\ntheir country to foreign investors, whatever\ntheir reasons may be.\nFrom a human rights standpoint, the blackout\nhas had surprisingly little effect on the spirit\nof the Egyptian people. Their presence in the\nstreets more than a week after the turmoil began indicates that the information revolution\nhas matured to the point where the power is\nnow really in the hands of the people, whether\nthey are reporters pushing photos to us via satellite or protesters struggling on dialup to get\ntheir stories told.\n\u201cDesign-wise, the\nsystem is a refinement,\nrather than a complete\ntransformation\u201d\nSure, it\u2019s technically impressive. But can you eat it? No? Sorry, I\u2019m out...\nFriday 04 february 2011\n12\n\n"

What\nthe two of them don\u2019t say to each other is just\nas damaging to the pair\u2019s marriage as what\nthey have to say to one another in a rare argu-ment. And there is a memorable fiery scene in\nwhich a lot of the film\u2019s issues and the troubles\nare summed up \u2013 a beautifully written scene,\nbrought to life by two hugely talented actors.\nKidman has shown intensity before, so the real\nsurprise here is Eckhart, who brings the performance of his career.\nAn odd relationship between Becca and the\nteenage driver who accidentally killed her son\nalso develops: an interesting plot choice for\nthis film. Their exchange is awkward and uncomfortable to watch at first, and you wonder\nwhether a thing like this is ever possible in\nreal-life, but as Becca spends more time with\nJason (Miles Teller), it feels poignant and un-forced, something achieved in part by the talents of Kidman and the newcomer Teller.\nSurprisingly, given the heavy themes it deals\nwith, Rabbit Hole can be amusing at times. This\nis never inappropriately handled \u2013 not a dark\nor twisted humour \u2013 but there are still several\nLosing a child is one of the most emotive subjects a film can take, and can deliver some of\nthe finest performances from its actors, or else\nfall flat. Rabbit Hole follows the lives of Becca\n(Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart)\nin the aftermath of their four-year-old son\u2019s accidental death, hit by a car whilst playing with\nhis dog. Eight months on, and both Becca and\nHowie are struggling to move on. Everything in\nthe house reminds them of him; the pictures on\nthe fridge, the clothes in his room, the home-vid-eos, and even the fingerprints on the door-knobs.\nGroup grief counseling is the most obvious\nfirst step, but something Becca can\u2019t get used\nto, especially when someone brings up the idea\nof God. \u201cGod needed another angel.\u201d It\u2019s a nice\ntheory one of the mothers comes up with. Becca\u2019s response? \u201cHe\u2019s God. Why didn\u2019t he just\nmake another angel?\u201d Good point Becca, it\u2019s\ntime to leave the group. Howie makes an effort\nand finds a sympathetic ear in a fellow grief\ntherapy member Gaby (Sandra Oh). With the\nlighter moments involving the solid supporting\ncast. Wiest plays the role of Becca\u2019s mother\nto perfect, Oscar-worthy precision, providing\nsome off-beat humour as well as carefully interacting with Kidman\u2019s character to stir up effective sympathy. Oh, who is exceptional in all\nthe roles she takes on is once again exemplary\nas a straight-talking, charismatic character who\nmakes a lasting impression.\nThere are many familiar elements on display\nhere: the classic grieving music score of simple guitar plucking accompanied by the occasional piano playing dominates the soundtrack\nand there is the inevitable flashback scene that\nshows us in slow-motion the accident that\nstarted this chain of events. But a lot of this\nis tastefully handled without trying to squeeze\nout as many tears as possible. The flashback\nscene in particular is a focus entirely on Kidman at odd angles and zooms that immediately\npaints the chaotic atmosphere.\nRabbit Hole involves an incredibly tough\nsubject matter, and something that cannot be\nhandled lightly. But, despite the difficult tone,\nit manages to still be a pleasant watch and the\nfilm\u2019s perceptive look at a range of characters\nis impressive. Combined with stellar performances to back up such good material, Rabbit\nHole fully engrosses its audience and the quality shines through each of its well-sculpted, involving characters.\nClassic Cinema\nMean Streets\nOn the surface, New York City appears to be the\nphysical embodiment of the American Dream. The\nwide, leafy spaces of Central Park nestled amongst\nthe glittering spires of the skyscrapers that house\nthe largest financial district in the world project a\nsymbol of prosperity and success across the Atlantic. However every city has an underbelly and the\nseedy alley\u2019s beneath the behemoths of capitalist\nwealth and highrise apartments have proved irresistible for scores of directors since John Schlesinger\u2019s\nAcademy Award winning classic Midnight Cowboy.\nJohn Voight\u2019s iconic portrayal of a hustler slumming\nit with Dustin Hoffman\u2019s crippled conman introduced\nAmerican audiences to a new brave style of filmmak-ing, far from the glitzy optimism of the classic Hollywood aesthetics, and soon a young upstart director\nwas ready to stamp his own impression of this city of\ncontradictions on celluloid.\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s most personal film Mean\nStreets launched his career and sent him on a dizzying ascent to the top of the film world.

Originally a Roman Catholic Priest, Idris\nTawfiq is a British journalist and has written several\nbooks on his conversion to Islam back in 2001. He\nis known worldwide for his inspiring talks describing\nthe events that led him to becoming a Muslim.\nHis talk, entitled \u2018One Priest\u2019s Journey To Find The\nTruth\u2019 is a story of his path from being a Roman Catholic Priest in Vatican City to a Muslim convert. He\nis well-known for his style of speaking which is both\nsimple and very gentle, touching hearts, but also\nthought-provoking. Idris Tawfiq is well experienced\nin explaining Islam and his conversion to Islam in\nan unbiased and simple way. His vast knowledge\nof other religions (from being a Head of Religious\nStudies teacher at different schools) allows him to\nexplain Islam to people of all faiths.\nIn addition to the talk, there is also an Exhibition\non Thursday 10th February in the Sir Alexander\nFleming Building presenting Islam to people of all\nreligious backgrounds, so to find out more about\nIslam, come down at lunch time and have a look\naround. Aemun Reza\nSo what is \u2018iConnect\u2019?\niConnect is a project started by the Innovation\nSociety. It was initially started as an online\nmarketplace but now we\u2019re launching the \u201cBig\nPlan\u201d \u2013 Group Buying for Imperial College at\niConnectImperial.com. The idea is simple: if\nthere are enough people willing to purchase the\nsame product, it can be much much cheaper.\nIt\u2019s basically the Groupon model. The plan is to\nmaximize students\u2019 and staff\u2019s benefit through\nproviding discounts, while also giving the opportunity for local businesses to reach out to\nthe Imperial community. With student finance\ngetting ever-tighter, we want to help students\nget the best deal. We also aim to raise awareness and money for the Prince\u2019s Trust charity;\nall of our profits go to them.\nTell us more about the Innovation Society.\nThe Innovation Society is about fostering innovation within Imperial College through advice\nfrom us and relevant contacts within the uni-versity. It\u2019s a young society \u2013 only three years\nold. We believe that all Imperial students have\nthe potential to be the next Bill Gates or Steve\nJobs, but someone must first stand up and create the atmosphere where students dare to think\ncreatively and turn their ideas into reality. \u2026\nthe process of innovation is painful and risky,\nbut it\u2019s worth trying because we have faith in\nour students!\nSo what sort of deals can I get with iConnect?\nAt the moment we\u2019re getting around 20-50%\ndiscounts with various businesses, mostly restaurants and caf\u00e9s around South Ken. For ex-ample, we have 33% off Oddonno\u2019s ice cream,\n50% off Circle Club membership and other\ndeals with theatres, takeaways and sit-down\nrestaurants. We\u2019re also getting extra money\nfor charity: Kensington Cr\u00eaperie have agreed\nto give 25p to the Prince\u2019s Trust for every purchase from Imperial students and staff and the\nchance to win a meal for two worth \u00a330 \u2013 simply quote iConnectImperial.\nHow does it work?\nWhat you do is go to the website and pick a\ndeal. The deals are open for four or five days,\nso you have time to talk to your mates and\ndecide. Then put down your card details and\nbuy it. If enough people buy the deal, then you\nget a money-off coupon. If not, you keep your\nmoney anyway.\nAnd this benefits charity?\nAll profits go to the Prince\u2019s Trust, alongside\nthe donations from Kensington Cr\u00eaperie. The\nTrust\u2019s motto is \u201chelping change young lives\u201d,\nand it helps young people in difficult situations,\nfor example who got into prison for the wrong\nreasons, to rebuild meaningful lives. So the students get good deals, the businesses get more\ncustom and the Prince\u2019s Trust gets more money\nto help young people.\nWhat else does the Innovation Society do?\nWe also run an online marketplace on the\nwebsite which allows you to sell second hand\nitems and search for accommodation from\nCraigslist and Nestoria. We also regularly\nenter business and innovation competitions.\nWe entered a \u2018Dragon\u2019s Den\u2019 style competition called \u201cProfitunity\u201d where we were in the\nnational final, turning \u00a3500 to \u00a32,500 in three\nmonths.\nCan students get involved?\nWe\u2019re always extremely keen for people to\nbe involved \u2013 you can do things from running\nthe website to developing your new ideas. Just\nemail us at innosoc@imperial.ac.uk. I\u2019ve learnt\na tremendous amount about running a business\nand developing ideas from the Innovation Society. I have regular meetings with a business\nmentor still thanks to Profitunity. One also\nlearns a lot about people and different styles of\nworking. The original President WenQian was\nmore of an \u2018ideas man\u2019 and I\u2019m more a problem solver \u2013 I learnt both types of person are\ninvaluable. There\u2019s lots of potential for posts\nof responsibility in the committee too, helping\npeople in turn grow their ideas. All great for the\nCV and later life.\nWhat\u2019s next and where\u2019s it going?\nWe\u2019re working with Felix to coordinate our\nmarketplace with their new classified page.\nYou can get your ad in two places without\nmessing up the notice boards. We\u2019re also getting loads more amazing deals for staff and\nstudents, so keep checking the site \u2013 you can\nsave money and contribute to the Price\u2019s Trust\nat the same time. We want at least 5% of students and staff to benefit from deals, so 1,000\nregular users.

    "content": "FELIX 37\nFollowing a somewhat manic debut in Brazil, Priya Garg finds time to\nunwind and uncovers some of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s hidden treasures\nFinding tranquility in chaos\nO\nur second day in Rio de\nJaneiro had arrived and\nwe wanted to see the acclaimed towering figure\nthat stands guard atop\nMount Corcovado, Christ the Redeemer.\nFrom nearly every vantage point in Rio\n\u2013 whether roaming down the random\n\u00b4Rues\u00b4 in Botefugo or actually climbing\nthe winding road past Santa Teresa to\nthe foot of Christ \u2013 the statue is always\nobserving you on your way. Despite\nour dichotomous religious beliefs \u2013 one\natheist and one believer \u2013 in a strange\nmanner we both felt protected by the\nomnipresence of something so sacred.\nOn our way up through Santa Teresa,\nour passage was halted by the view of\na giant stairway covered with multi-coloured painted tiles in the midst of\nthe favelas (Brazilian slums). A local\ninformed us that we could venture to the\ntop step of this masterpiece but not be-yond, to prevent ignorantly strolling into\nthe \u2018City of God\u2019 \u2013 gangland territory.\nBeing careful not to underestimate the\nvery real violent crime of Rio, we decided to maintain our distance.\nThe staircase had been the life work\nof artist Jorge Selaron, the original backpacker who visited more than fifty countries before settling in Rio and creating\nthis enormous tribute to the people of\nBrazil. Each richly-decorated glazed tile\nwould have otherwise been untouched\nby foreigners.\nWhen we reached the summit of\nCorcovado, it was, as expected, bustling\nwith tourists, snapping pictures of themselves with arms spread before Christ.\nA white mist of cloud hung over the\nedges of the statue obscuring our view,\nyet gazing across what we could see of\nRio\u2019s hilly panorama, there was a tangible sense of peace garnered by lingering\nat the hem of Christ\u00b4s robes.\nIn pursuit of inner calm we took the\nopportunity to visit the Jardin Botanico,\nthe house through a carved stone arch-way, we were presented with a square\nswimming pool surrounded by a spacious open courtyard dotted with luxurious Victorian furniture, roughly tied\nbunches of bright flowers and Brazilians\nsipping coffee and dipping their brushes\ninto pots of paint. In the background we\nsaw the rising presence of Corcovado,\nwith Christ gazing downward.\nAs we sat on steps in the tiered gardens of the Parque, light quickly faded\nand we were able to view Rio in its\nevening splendour. We observed the\nlagoon in the core of Rio, surrounded\nby a crescent of hills: a sea of tumbling\nfavelas, sky rise tower blocks, people\nhurrying by, beeping vehicles, swathes\nof graffiti. Finally we turned to the\nshadow of the silent mansion, fountains\nand forests. We felt at peace, removed\nfrom the hubbub in the distance. We sat\nfor a while, discussing the importance\nof finding such a place, even in a huge\ncity of noise, sounds and excitement: it\ndoesn\u00b4t need to be far away, it just needs\nto be somewhere where you can escape\neverything for a moment, and feel calm.\na large landscaped garden stretching\nacres across the centre of the city. An oasis of tranquility in the middle of all the\nhustle and bustle, it felt as if time paused\nas we walked past gigantic redwoods,\ncrimson roses, gushing fountains, pouring waterfalls, canopies of thatched\nbamboo, miniature bonsais, placid lakes\nand floating green lily-pads.\nStruggling out of a stupor imposed\nby the lull of the gardens, we further\nclimbed to the Parque Lage, the grounds\nof a dilapidated mansion housing art\nclasses for the creative masses.

Not using his magical powers and fire breath to end crime and injustice, just watching with a grin and Mojito\nTRAVEL\nis representative of either a country that\nSelaron himself visited, or of historic\nevents in Brazilian history that captured\nhis imagination.\nAn impoverished visionary, he sold\nall of his possessions to purchase the\nnecessities to allow him to continue\nplastering ceramic squares across this\nstone staircase. His unwavering devotion led to the work being featured in a\nCoca-Cola advertisement, a U2 video\nand, for the eagle-eyed amongst you, the\nbackground of a scene from the \u00b4The Incredible Hulk\u00b4. Despite his commercial\nsuccess, Selaron remains a penniless artist creating his sculpture in a dirty area\nof downtown bohemia, on a street that\n\u201cThere was a\ntangible sense of\npeace garnered by\nlingering at the hem\nof Christ\u00b4s robes\u201d\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel Editors: Dylan Lowe\nChris Richardson\nIs it a bird?

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX 35\nR\necently I went for lunch at\nFiveSixEight in Beit Quad\nand was very surprised\nto find oven-baked Blue\nShark Fillet available on\nthe menu at a very affordable \u00a35.50.\nI wanted to double check if it really\nwas shark fillet, so I e-mailed the commercial services manager, who confirmed that yes indeed they were serving real shark on the menu. I decided to\nreply and ask very politely if they would\nconsider taking shark off the menu for\nthe following three reasons:\n1. Blue Shark (Prionace glauca), is\nlisted in the 2010 IUCN Red List\nassessment as threatened and the\ncontinued sale of shark fillets contributes to the decline of shark\npopulations globally. Blue Sharks\nare among the most heavily fished\nsharks in the world.\n2. Sharks have been on the planet\nfor around 400 million years, and\nas top predators they play an important role in marine ecosystems.\nSharks are slow-growing, late to\nmature, and do not reproduce often\n\u2013 this means that shark populations\nare particularly vulnerable to overfishing and recover slowly, if at all.\n3. This university is one of the world\u2019s\nbest higher education institutions\nand we have a large international\nstudent and staff population. I think\nit would send out a very positive\nmessage if we refuse to serve shark\non our menus.\nI tried to be really positive and engage\nopenly with the authorities as I think this\nis probably the best way to try and negotiate change. I have had a response to my\ne-mail and it\u2019s actually very interesting\nalthough not very satisfying.\nThey said that the role of the catering\nestablishment is primarily commercial\nand \u201cthe sales of shark fillets are currently representing a huge success\u201d.\nThey asked me to be reassured that the\nshark fillets they currently sell are in line\nwith the university sustainability policy,\nand that the company they use to source\ntheir food \u201csupply only products which\nare certified by the EU Food Standard\nAgency under licence to be acceptable\nin Welfare, Hygiene and Conservation\u201d.\nA Shark\u2019s Tale ends\nin FiveSixEight\nKate Turner wants to start a fish fight with you\nUnfortunately this does not reassure me\nand I am looking into this further and\ntrying to find out from the supplier their:\n- catch method\n- area of catch\n- landing port\n- and, target species.\nIt seems to me that a more efficent\nroute to remove shark from the menu\nwould be if it doesn\u2019t sell well. Hit\nthem where it hurts, in the pocket. So\nI guess there is work to be done to\neducate students and staff to be aware\nof the environmental impact of eating\nshark and other unsustainable fish has.\nThis is why I am writing to you. I have\nsome ideas for raising awareness and\nam discussing the issue with Biteback\n(a radical animal rights movement), so\nexpect more about this in the next instalment of what could develop into an\nepic battle between good and evil \u2013 or\nme just dressed up in a shark suit during\nmy lunch breaks handing out leaflets\noutside the bar.\nBut seriously, it would be fantastic if\nwe could convince them to take shark\noff the menu, it is such a wonderful\nukaaa/flickr The Food Pornographer/flickr\nopportunity to send a positive message\nto our students and staff. Sustainable\nfish and fishing methods have been in\nthe news a lot lately, thanks to Hugh\nFearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s Fish Fight series on Channel 4 (http://www.fishfight.\nnet). This series covered some of the\nmajor issues facing the oceans and investigated how fish gets onto our plates.\nControversial issues such as shark fin\nsoup, by catch, tuna fishing and salmon\nfarming were examined and all of the\nprogrammes encouraged people to think\nabout the impact we have, and to consider alternatives. Whilst serving shark\nfillet is very different from serving shark\n\u201cBlue Sharks are\namong the most\nheavily fished\nsharks in the world\u201d\nfin, it still encourages the consumption\nof an endangered species. While other\nuniversities have been embracing the\nFish Fight, for example, the University\nof Portsmouth Catering Dept have been\nselling mackerel baps in the student\nunion, we at Imperial are selling shark\nfillets. Frankly, it\u2019s just embarrassing\nand shows a lack of awareness of these\nimportant issues.\nI wonder if we can begin a fish fight of\nour own here at Imperial \u2013 we can begin\nby getting shark off the FiveSixEight\nmenu. The Marine Conservation Society\npublishes its \u2018Good Fish Bad Fish\u2019guide\n(www.fishonline.org) - shark is rated as\na fish to avoid (Red 5), and yet we are\nserving this up to our students in the\nunion bar. As a science based institution\nsurely we can do better than this! Take a\nstand and don\u2019t order the shark. The future of the shark and its habitat can only\nbe preserved if we take action, or in this\ncase, order a burger.\nAfter receiving student feedback the\nUnion has already ceased serving\nshark.\nHave a little fishy, on a little dishy... not exactly the best approach to eating shark if you ever want to see one in the wild again\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nWhy are we still accepting bad films?\nA\nwards season is here,\nand whether you take an\ninterest or not, it generally means the time of\nyear when the cinemas\nare packed with impressive, intelligent\nfilms. Though a few of the leading films\nin this year\u2019s nominees, such as The Social Network or Toy Story 3 were out a\nfew months ago, the majority of the ones\ngenerating buzz have only emerged very\nrecently (Black Swan, 127 Hours, True\nGrit, The King\u2019s Speech). Now is a time\nwhen film aficionados will actually relish going to the cinema, a time when\nthey may not actually resent the huge\ndents in their bank accounts most ticket\nprices leave.\nBut this isn\u2019t necessarily a thing to feel\nso grateful for. What it highlights most\nof all is the distinct lack of quality we\u2019ve\ngotten so used to in most of the films we\npay to see. Let\u2019s look at the line-up we\nwere treated to in the summer \u2013 Zac\nEfron starring in bland drama/romance\nCharlie St. Cloud, a predictable romcom\nwith Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston (The Switch \u2013 if that means anything\nto you), and, of course, Step Up: 3D.\nThese films are, at best, good for taking\nthe piss out of, but considering the fact\nthat Step Up: 3D alone had an estimated\nbudget of US$30 million, it stops being\nfunny pretty quickly.\nIn context, $30 million is the entire\ncost of a HIV/AIDS Prevention and\nControl Programme in the Dominican\nRepublic. The budget for that other summer smash hit, Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, was around $85\nmillion. This is the equivalent amount\nthe US government pledged to fund renewable energy in 2009.\nThis isn\u2019t an argument saying that\nHollywood should be curing cancer\nand saving the world instead of releasing awful films; I realise that it isn\u2019t as\nclear-cut as that (though I am sure that\nif you gave an AIDS sufferer in the Dominican Republic a copy of Step Up: 3D\ninstead of antiretroviral medicine, you\u2019d\nget punched in the throat. And rightly\nso.). These films do have their place and\nthe freedom for the arts to be able to operate without restriction is an invaluable\nthing. But the ever-inflated cost of films\nis unnecessary and, more often than not,\nFELIX 29\nonly serves to churn out yet another forgettable film.\nThe film industry sees a relatively cyclical stream of funding, with even a lot\nof \u201cbad\u201d films managing to drum up a\ndecent enough attendance at the box office to avoid catastrophic losses. At the\nsame time, for the amount of money that\nends up being committed to these films,\nwe should be expecting something\nmore. It\u2019s not just a case of creating low-The late, great John Barry remembered\nEd Knock\nIt\u2019s the most famous title sequence in\ncinema; A white circle bobs across the\nscreen, the camera reveals we\u2019re looking down a gun barrel before 007 strides\nacross the frame shooting the unfortunate owner and as the blood drips down\nthe screen, those famous swinging orchestral chords blast out rising to a stac-ato climax \u2013 \u2018Dun! Dun! Duhhh! Dun!\nDun! Duhhh!\u2019.\nThe music is arguably as iconic as\nthe man in the Tuxedo himself and the\n\u2018James Bond Theme\u2019 would be used\nin every film until Casino Royale.\nHowever the theme was only meant\nto be used for Dr. No and it was only\nconsidered to be used again for From\nRussia With Love at the last moment,\nfortunately for the many generations of\nJames Bond fans.\nJohn Barry was born in York (where,\nincidentally, James Bond star Dame\nJudy Dench is from as well) in 1933.\nImmersed in films from a young age by\nhis father who owned eight cinemas in\nthe city, Barry was classically trained in\nthe piano and trumpet. He formed his\nown big band the \u2018John Barry Seven\u2019\nin 1957 and managed to produce some\nhit records, but as rock\u2019n\u2019roll started to\ninvade the airwaves he found himself\nscoring for film and television instead.\nAfter the success of James Bond,\nJohn Barry was soon in high demand\nfrom film producers. He eventually\nbagged five Academy Awards for Born\nFree, The Lion in Winter, Out of Africa\nand Dances with Wolves. His scores\nwere typified by grand, soaring strings\nand heavy use of brass inspired by the\nbands of his native Yorkshire.\nAlthough being influenced by the\ncomposers of the classical era such as\nBernard Herrmann, John Barry was simultaneously an innovator, being one\nof the first to incorporate synthesizers\ninto his scores, and he also regularly\nincluded pop songs best exampled by\nthe use of Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u2018Everybody\nTalking\u2019 in Midnight Cowboy.\nJohn Barry died of a heart attack last\nSunday in New York, a city that fittingly owed it\u2019s namesake to his home\ntown.\nTwo of the worst offenders: Are Jolie\u2019s humanitarian efforts undone by The Tourist, a $100 million flop?\nJade Hoffman on Hollywood\u2019s extortionate spending on last year\u2019s worst films\nbudget cult classic like Clerks or The\nBlair Witch Project which can generate impressive amounts of interest and\nrespect on the bare minimum, but more\nto do with the cast and crew investing a\nworthy amount of time and thought in\nwhat they create. One of the most celebrated films of last year, Inception, took\ndirector Christopher Nolan around eight\nyears to complete and, whilst it isn\u2019t a\nperfect film, it certainly lives up to its\n$160 million investment. The flood of\ncritical acclaim that trailed Nolan, and\nstill does, after this film is not exactly\nexcessive \u2013 the man deserves appreciation for his work \u2013 but this level of effort\nshould be going into all films that Hollywood rolls out.\nOnly last December, unexpected\nblockbuster Monsters shot to fame for\nbeing made for $800,000 \u2013 a near un-heard-of feat at the cinema \u2013 and easily generated a substantial profit at the\nbox office. By contrast, Jack Black\u2019s\nlatest Gulliver\u2019s Travels didn\u2019t even\nmake back half of its $112 million costs\nand was lucky to get 2-star ratings from\nmost critics. Cost is not equal to quality \u2013 a lesson that Hollywood has still\nnot seemed to learn. Some of the most\nexpensive films made to date have been\nshoddy sequels to lucrative franchises\n(Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s\nEnd or X-Men: The Last Stand for ex-ample) and, whilst they manage to still\ncash-in fairly well, accepting a second-rate production from a franchise that can\nand has provided better shouldn\u2019t be so\ncommonplace.\nWith the BAFTAs and Academy\nAwards just weeks away, it\u2019s a good\ntime to take advantage of the decent\nfilms gracing our screens for what feels\nlike a limited amount of time, but considering the cost, it\u2019s about time we demanded a higher standard.\n\u201cThe ever-inflated\ncost of films is\nunnecessary and\nonly serves to churn\nout yet another\nforgettable film.\u201d\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

So, did\nDead Space 2 do any better on that front?\nWell... sort of. Before I go on like an embittered O.A.P. let me make it clear to you that\nthe Dead Space series is in no way bad \u2013 after\nall, I played the original at least five times over\nand I can bet my left nut that I\u2019ll be doing the\nsame thing with its newest sibling. The weapons are fun to use and dismembering enemies\nto kill them is still a reasonably fresh concept.\nMany smaller changes from the original make\nlife much more enjoyable, such as the mobility\ncontrol in zero-G environments and the self-charging stasis module, but others less so. You\noften have to stomp on fallen Necromorphs to\nget the goods they drop, which becomes quite\nfrustrating in larger battles when you have to\nscavenge ammo from dead foes whilst trying\nto avoid being ripped apart by their surviving\nbrethren.\nThere are a couple of new Necromorphs that\ngo out of their way to slaughter you and whilst\nthere have only been a few new additions, I was\nvery impressed to find that they all filled niches\nnot occupied by the original Dead Space line-up. There\u2019s a long range attacker that spews\ncorrosive acid, organic proximity mines and\ncrawling bombs, a pack attacker and, my personal favourite, a new Necromorph that hunts\nintelligently, aptly named \u2018Stalkers\u2019. These\nbastards will drive you mad. Fast and danger-ous, they\u2019ll lure you into attacking one of their\nnumbers whilst another sneaks up to charge\ninto one of your blind sides. Unlike most Necromorphs you have to plan and time your attacks against these guys to avoid being gored;\nbattles with them were invariably the tensest.\nIsaac also dropped the Gordon Freeman approach to survival and actually speaks now and\nthen, mostly in response to the NPCs guiding\nhim along. I suppose I like this change, turning\nIsaac from a human puppet to more of an actual\nperson, but at the same time I couldn\u2019t help but\nthink he sounded an awful lot like Tom Cruise.\nVery off-putting.\nThere\u2019s also the new multiplayer component,\nbut it\u2019s nothing spectacular. You play either as\na security officer or a Necromorph in teams of\nfour, with the security team trying to get shit\ndone whilst the Necromorphs attempt to screw\ntheir shit up. Unless Visceral continually update this mode I can\u2019t see it becoming popular.\nThat said, it is a nice little extra that\u2019ll add, at\nthe very least, a few more hours to playtime.\nOK, rant time. First, people really need to\nstop calling Dead Space a survival horror. It\nis not a survival horror, it is an action shooter.\nNow that\u2019s fine with me, but stop calling it a\nhorror game! Dead Space 2 will shock you and\nmake you curse now and then, but \u2018shocking\u2019\nis not the same thing as \u2018scaring\u2019. \u2018Shocking\u2019\nis when someone walks up behind me unannounced and explodes a paper bag right next to\nmy ear. \u2018Scaring\u2019 is when my asthmatic house-breather and relax. These only serve to heighten the experiences felt from the high areas,\nwhere most of the action takes place. High,\nlow, high, low; that\u2019s how it\u2019s meant to go (I\nintended that to rhyme). Mentioned earlier,\nAmnesia is a good example of this \u2013 you have a\ncalm central hub from which you move to high\ntension areas.\nThe effect of a game with little to no pacing can be seen in Dead Space 2. It leaves you\nmentally drained, and you become exhausted\nfrom the near-constant action. Long lift journeys need to be left peaceful. Cut-scenes need\nto be that little bit longer. Puzzles should not be\ninterrupted by Necromorphs leaping out to give\nyou a big hug and a slobbery kiss. In short, the\ngame needs to let you relax now and then.\nOn saying all of this you may think that I\ndislike Dead Space 2, which simply isn\u2019t true.\nAside from the pacing issues and a poor idea of\nwhat scary is, Dead Space 2 is still a pretty decent game. It has many shining moments, such\nas one where you return to the Ishimura, the\nship that the original game was set in. At the\nstart of the level I assumed that it\u2019d just be a\ncut and paste job, and hence feel pretty unorigi-nal. Ironically, it turned out to be my favourite\nlevel. I got a very strange feeling of nostalgia,\nand memories of the original game came flooding back as I traversed some of the old levels.\nIt was also the only level in the game that I felt\nmade decent use of the aforementioned pacing.\nSo would I advise you to fork out a wad of\ncash and purchase this sequel? Chances are if\nyou\u2019re a fan you\u2019ve already bought it and wasted your whole weekend playing it like I did\n(just ask my housemates), so this review will\nhave been a waste of time (sorry about that).\nOn the other hand, if you\u2019re new to the series\nI\u2019d say pick up the original game cheaply before moving to its shinier bro.\nDead Space 2 is available now from\nVisceral Games on PS3, Xbox 360 and PC.\nNew aliens, same ol\u2019 frights\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nDuBlox\nhoodamath.com/games/dublox.php\nHave you ever tried to pick up tofu with chopsticks?\nIf so, you will probably already be a master of the\ncomplex logic behind this geometrical puzzler. As the\nfour yellow cubes flop around the stage flipping and\nrolling, much like tofu cubes in the hands of a chopstick amateur, your brain will go in meltdown trying to\ncomprehend where to lie them flat, where to stand\nthem up and, ultimately, how to get them to the red\ngoal zone.\nYou may think this is just another of those block\ngames you can solve by trial and error, but that\u2019s\nwhere you\u2019re wrong. To get through this one you\nmight actually have to (shock horror) think. Later levels are real stumpers. Visuals are pretty awesome,\nespecially on the animation.\nIn this nautical shooter, you control a torpedo-shoot-ing submarine tasked with one simple instruction:\ndestroy all enemy ships! Cruisers sail the waves\nabove you while other subs stalk the seabed below\nyou, all firing a multitude of missiles your way.\nAs the action starts to get going, the sheer number of missiles in the waters require some extreme\nconcentration to dodge, all while trying to position\nthe sub in the right place. Not even the upgrades can\nhelp when things start getting messy. A fun little action game that you\u2019ll keep coming back to.\nTorpedos Armed\ntinyurl.com/torpedosarmed\n\u201cDead Space 2 leaves\nyou exhausted from the\nnear-constant action.\u201d\n32\nDead Space 2 can\u2019t scare me, claims Laurence Pope\nmate is out at a party and I can hear heavy la-boured breathing in the kitchen at 2 a.m. Nothing really emphasised this point better than one\nencounter near the start of the game.\nYou begin Dead Space 2 with no ability to\ndefend yourself, and you have to run past a load\nof Necromorphs to escape the area you start in,\nwhich is admittedly a pretty bad-ass way to\nopen. Running down a set of stairs with three\nslashers trying to tear me apart whilst I desperately navigated blockades was genuinely scary\nand tense. However, the very second I got my\nhands on the plasma cutter all tension evaporated in an instant. You\u2019re armed, and if you\u2019re\nnot a blind paraplegic you can aim and kill with\nit. Enemies ceased to be a threat, and all you\nhave to do from there on in is to keep some\nammo handy and you\u2019re golden. It\u2019s fun, yes,\nbut it\u2019s not scary.\nAnd here\u2019s another thing \u2013 pacing. If you\u2019re\nunfamiliar with the concept, pacing revolves\naround the idea of highs and lows in a game.\nThe lows are calm areas, places you can take a\nThis is why I\u2019ll never live in Griffon Studios in Clapham...\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\n14\nPolitics Editors: Rory Fenton\nJames Lees, Rajat Jain\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nPakistan\nA federal judge in Florida has tossed out the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama, setting up what is likely to be\na contentious Supreme Court challenge over the legislation in coming months. Judge Vinson ruled that\n\u201cObamacare\u201d violated the rights of an individual by\nmaking it mandatory to buy health insurance on the\npain of a fine. The United States Justice Department has said that it strongly disagreed with the\nruling and would appeal against the decision which\nwas praised by House Republicans. The Republican\ncontrolled House of Representatives have already\nrepealed Obama\u2019s Healthcare reform but the repeal\nis unlikely to clear the American Senate.\nUnited States\nA court in Pakistan has blocked the release of\nAmerican Raymond Davis who was arrested for\nkilling two men in Lahore last week. Mr Davis has\nadmitted killing the men but stressed that he was\nacting in self defence when confronted by the two\narmed men. The American embassy has called for\nthe release of Mr Davis, saying that he was a consular official with diplomatic immunity and hence immune to prosecution in Pakistan. This was disputed\nby Pakistani authorities who said that Mr Davis was a\nprivate security contractor.\nBurma\nBurma\u2019s long-standing leader Than Shwe is not\non the list of five Presidential nominees put forth\nby the newly convened Parliament of Burma. This\nsuggests that General Than Shwe would no longer\nbe the official leader of Burma but analysts believe\nthat he is unlikely to relinquish all power and is expected to remain as head of the military. Burma\u2019s\nParliament convened for the first time in twenty\nyears on Monday as part of Burma\u2019s \u2018roadmap to\ndemocracy\u2019. The Burma military, however, still plays\nan important role in the nation\u2019s politics with \u00bc of\nall seats reserved for members of the military.\nWhile Ireland\u2019s media reports on the in-fight-ing and dithering of its main parties, the Irish\npeople remain focused on the forthcoming general election - a long-awaited opportunity to\nchoose the politicians they believe to be most\ncapable of managing the greatest crisis in the\nstate\u2019s short history.\nPrime Minister Brian Cowen, who recently\nresigned as leader of the majority coalition\npartner Fianna F\u00e1il, remains in charge of a\ncountry baying for his political blood and of\na cabinet which, following a spate of resignations last month, is stumbling into the election\nwith less than half of its usual compliment of\nministers. Cowen, it seems, has been deemed\ncompetent enough to lead Ireland, but not\ncompetent enough to lead Fianna F\u00e1il. This\nis yet another example of the vast disconnect\nwhich has developed between the ruling party\nand the Irish public, one which by now would\nbe almost a laughing matter were it not for the\neconomic tragedy that the former has inflicted\nupon the latter.\nIn truth, however, it is an astonishing achievement on Cowen\u2019s part to have held onto power\nwhile presiding over an economic downturn of\nsuch unprecedented magnitude - brewed during his time as Minister for Finance from 2004\nuntil 2008 and poured ice-cold during his subsequent tenure as Taoiseach.\nAfter a failed leadership heave against him\nin mid-January, it appeared that \u2018Biffo\u2019 (Big\nIgnorant F****r From Offaly) would lead his\ndeeply unpopular party into an election on\nMarch 11th from which it would do well to return half of its 72 sitting members of the Irish\nparliament, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. However, a botched\nattempt to fill vacant cabinet positions without\nconsulting the Green party - the coalition\u2019s junior partner \u2013 was a PR disaster for Cowen and,\nfollowing his resignation several days later, the\nGreens announced their immediate withdrawal\nfrom government. An agreement was reached\nbetween government and opposition which\nsaw the election date brought forward and the\nlegislation enacting December\u2019s budget rushed\nthrough both houses of parliament.\nMuch like the now-extinct Progressive\nDemocrats before them, the Green party appear destined to pay a heavy political price\nfor their decision to enter coalition with Fianna F\u00e1il in 2007. In the press conference announcing their withdrawal from government,\nMinister for the Environment John Gormley\npointed to a number of the party\u2019s achievements during their time in office, including\nlegislation on same-sex civil partnerships and\nhunting. These, however, are mere footnotes\nin the legacy of this government in light of Ireland\u2019s fiscal position. The Greens\u2019 image has\nbeen damaged irreparably by their relationship\nwith the toxic Fianna F\u00e1il brand, and any result other than complete annihilation would be\nan achievement in itself.\nThere is undoubtedly a desire among the\nIrish public for a change in government. And\nCowen fecks off\nHugh McDowell\nalthough the two parties likely to form the next\ncoalition \u2013 the centre-right Fine Gael and the\ncentre-left Labour party \u2013 will make significant\ngains in D\u00e1il seats, they have thus far struggled\nto inspire or capture the imagination of the\nelectorate. Fine Gael leader and presumptive\nTaoiseach Enda Kenny continues to be dogged\nby his uncharismatic and uninspiring media\npresence, and his attempts to include the leaders of smaller parties in an upcoming series of\ntelevised debates is seen by many commentators as an attempt to minimize his own time\nunder the glare of the spotlight. Meanwhile,\nthe Nick Clegg to Kenny\u2019s David Cameron,\nLabour leader Eamon Gilmore, is by a country\nmile the most popular leader in the country. Although Gilmore is reaping the rewards for several years of steady leadership and assured performances in the D\u00e1il, his unwillingness to take\non the powerful and well-remunerated public\nservice employees remains a worrying prospect for certain sections of the voting public.\nIn truth, both Fine Gael and Labour will be\nglad to allow the outgoing government to associate themselves with the austerity measures\ncontained in the last budget. In the same manner as the UK\u2019s Conservatives have done over\nthe last 8 months, the next government will\nattempt to blame any piece of bad economic\nnews on their predecessors. The two parties\nshould win a substantial majority in the election and form a coalition, the ministerial makeup of which will be dependant on the respective\nnumber of seats each wins. Despite Gilmore\u2019s\npopularity, it is unlikely that Labour will be the\nlarger of the partners and he will settle for a\nposition for the role of T\u00e1naiste (Deputy Prime\nMinister) while a number of his senior fellow\nparty members are offered ministries.\nTheir opposition will most likely be comprised of a decimated Fianna F\u00e1il, a resurgent\nSinn F\u00e9in (buoyed by the probable election\nof their leader, former MP Gerry Adams) and\na swathe of independents from either end of\nthe political spectrum. Although a number of\neconomists and high-profile personalities have\nannounced their intention to run on independent platforms, the absence of any major new\npolitical movement taking part in the election\nhas disappointed voters and exacerbated the\ngrowing sense of frustration with the political\nsystem.\nA major failing of said political system is\nthe dissatisfaction that the Irish people feel\nwith their electoral mechanism, Proportional\nRepresentation. PR differs from the Alternative Vote system proposed by the current\nBritish government only in that it has multi-seat, rather than single-seat, constituencies.\nConsequently, politicians from the same con-stituency, and even from the same party, are\nin constant competition with one another on a\nlocal level to curry favour with voters, often\nto the detriment of the quality and quantity of\nlegislation passed through the D\u00e1il.\nFurthermore, parties are likely to remain as\n\u2018vanilla\u2019as possible around election time in order to get transfers from the voters of other par-ties. This has caused a scramble to the centre\nin Irish politics and narrowing in the breadth of\nopinions expressed in political debate. Given\nthat this consensus approach to politics has\nbrought Ireland to its current condition, it is a\nsystem which is worthy of reconsideration.\nHe\u2019s either grimacing because Ireland is completely screwed or because he\u2019s gassy.\nWe\u2019re going with gassy on this one...\nCameron could learn from Irish PM\u2019s collapsed coalition\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Award ceremonies are\neverywhere as the ultimate narcissists\ncongratulate themselves on just how\nwonderful they are.\nI don\u2019t know about you but that\u2019s my\nidea of a fun night in. I love the red car-pet, the utter rubbish people say about\nhow grateful they are for the free booze\nand their nominations, as well as all the\nsparkly dresses. However I know that\nthe Americans totally out-do us on the\ngrandeur stakes. For a while I wondered\nif that was reflective of the differences between American\nand British television. Can\nthe output of British television really compete?\nUntil the last year or so\nI can\u2019t say I watched\nanything British\nthat I thought was\nmust-see tel-evision, but I\u2019ve\ncome to change\nmy mind and suddenly have a vested\ninterest in our\nown award\nceremonies.\nWhich brings me to the Bafta\u2019s ugly\nstepsisters. The National Television\nAwards.\nDon\u2019t you just love the name? Makes\nit sound all important. However I suspect it\u2019s just a way for ITV to throw a\nparty that can air fill an evening of telly.\nThe change from Trevor McDonald as\nhost to lovable cheeky chappy Dermot\nO\u2019Leary really emphasizes the tone\nthe awards is aiming for. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I enjoyed it anyway. What with\nmy own snarky inner dialogue entertaining me. Shamefully I did find by\nthe end of the night that no matter how\nridiculous you consider an award cer-emony, if you you sit down to watch,\nbefore you know it you\u2019re fighting\na corner. I knew it meant little\nand the shows were aimed at\nan Eastenders loving audi-ence, but I just couldn\u2019t help\nmyself.\nSherlock and Moffat were\ntotally slapped in the face by\nthe choice of Waterloo Road\nas best drama. What were they\nthinking? I know which one I\nwould flag up as must see TV\nand that would be the one without the shiny prize. This is a show\nthat celebrates all awful television\nout there, best comedy show \u2013 BeniWhat We Watched...\nThe words \u2018Period Drama\u2019 usually conjure up a rose-tinted image of vast country estates, sunshine and\nhappy endings. The fact that The Tudors isn\u2019t shown\nat prime time may lead one to believe that it is just\nmore of the aforementioned \u2013 possibly a repeat; rather than the fact that it is actually a massive shagfest.\nKing Henry is wonderfully portrayed as the bit-of-a-dick he probably was, and his wife (or the current one\nat least) looks young enough to make him a nonce\nby today\u2019s standards. She\u2019s a daft bint too. Most of\nthe characters are engaged in a spot of extra-marital\nbanging, and in this week\u2019s episode the King\u2019s footman ploughed the Queen.\nAnd in case you need any more reason to watch it \u2013\nHenry Cavill, the British actor who was recently cast\nas Superman (and who previously narrowly missed\nout on the roles of Batman and James Bond), plays\nCharles Brandon, advisor to Henry VII.\nThe BBC\u2019s This World programme follows the US\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement service (\u2018The\nPaedophile Hunters\u2019) whilst they track down American citizens fiddling with kids abroad. The narrator\u2019s attempt to intone a serious nasal dirge into the\nscript, which includes phrases such as \u201cfound with a\nlarge collection of dildos\u201d perhaps makes light of a\nrather disturbing subject matter.\nWaterloo Road (a.k.a. The Amanda Burton Show)\nreturned this week for its sixth series. For viewers of\na public-school disposition it should form a fantastic insight into the edification (or not) of the lower\nclasses. For myself, having attended a state comprehensive in that area generally known as \u2018The North\u2019;\nit brings back fond memories of school! (Yes that\u2019s\nright... we used to watch it in lessons...).\nA few new characters have been introduced to keep\nthings fresh but the plot is still as blatantly obvious\nas an erection in a pair of Speedos. If you\u2019re one of\nthose people who takes TV a little too seriously you\u2019ll\nfeel the need to slap \u2018Kyle Stack\u2019 or \u2018Finn Sharkey\u2019\n(what names...) most of the time, particularly if they\nremind you of that twat that used to sit at the back\nof the classroom shouting \u2018cabbages\u2019 at random\nintervals.\nKaren Fisher\u2019s long-lost daughter returns and\nmakes false allegations of sexual assault which are\ninvestigated by deputy Mr Mead - who, incidentally,\nhad it off with her sister last term (...banter!). This\nsomehow turns into an epic situation involving a\nbull mastiff and some sickly student-teacher flirting,\nwhich I presume is designed to push even the most\ncringe-immune of people over the edge.\nThe latest double-episode of Silent Witness was\nsomething of a disappointment after last week\u2019s\nwhen we fretted for a whole twenty-four hours about\nwhether he was actually dead. This week we wonder\nwhether he\u2019ll leave for another job. Those script writers really have it in for poor Harry.\nSpeaking of leaving; John Nettles\u2019 role in the nation\u2019s favourite country crime-drama Midsomer Murders came to an end on Wednesday after sixteen\nyears of playing DCI Tom Barnaby. Anyone hoping for\nan all-out murder extravaganza was disappointed as\nBarnaby spent much of the two hours (being grumpy)\nat a health retreat.

A\nfailure of a pipe connection to a rooftop\nwater tank is believed to have caused the\nflood on Thursday morning while a suspected valve failure, or pump malfunc-tion, caused a 6ft flood of water in the\nsub-basement during the weekend.\nIt is not yet known whether the two\nevents are linked but Director of Facilities and Property Management Nick\nRoalfe told Felix that it was possible\nthat the interrupted flow of water from\nthe weekend flood had applied extra\nstrain on the pipe connection. However,\nhe emphasized that they could not be\ncertain until the cause had been properly investigated. The Biochemistry\nbuilding was closed on Thursday but\nthe majority of the building is hoped to\nbe re-opened by the morning of Friday\nthe 4th.\nThursday\u2019s flood is believed to have\nsent hundreds of gallons of water cascading down into the Biochemistry\nbuilding leaving the top four floors of\nthe building most badly affected and\nseveral centimetres of standing water in\nparts of the building.\nStudents were first alerted via the Imperial website at approximately 9am.\nIn an email to Department of Life Sciences staff and Postgraduate Research\nstudents, Professor Paul Freemont said\nthat some instrument rooms had been hit\nbadly but that it appeared \u201cmost of the\nvery expensive pieces of kit\u201d had been\nspared. He said that the flood was a \u201cmajor blow\u201d but praised Estates for doing a\n\u201cgreat job\u201d.\nThe flooding disrupted the fire alarm\nsystems in both the Chemistry and Biochemistry building, forcing Mr Roalfe to\nclose down both buildings due to safety\nconcerns. The Chemistry building was\nreopened by approximately 9am after\nthe fire alarm system was restored there.\nAt the beginning of the week the Biochemistry and Chemistry buildings were\nleft with reduced water supplies earlier\nthis week after another flood during the\nweekend left damage to the Biochemistry basement.\nA 6ft flood of water in a Plant Room\nin the Biochemistry basement forced\nFacilities management to shut down the\nwater supply to the Biochemistry building as well as the neighbouring ChemisPipe connection failure sends\nwater gushing down through\nBiochemistry building\nMatt Colvin try Department.\nAlthough the water was quickly\npumped out, further disruption was\ncaused by damage to electrical control\npanels in the affected Biochemistry\nPlant Room, leaving hot water unavailable in the Biochemistry building and\nno water for toilets and laboratories in\nbuildings C1 and C2 of the Chemistry\nDepartment until Tuesday.\nThe lack of water led the Department of Chemistry to shut all labs and\nforcing the cancellation of laboratory\nclasses and the suspension of research\nactivities on Monday. Head of the Department of Chemistry Professor Tom\nWelton explained to Felix that the labs\nwere shut because some experiments\nrequire water to run but also due to\nsafety reasons; a ready supply of water\nis needed in case of spillages and other\nemergencies.\nOut of the five pumps previously\noperating in the Biochemistry Plant\nRoom, only one was working on Tuesday. The overall extent of the damage\nhas not been revealed, however, Buildings Manager Anna McDadd admitted\nin an email to staff that it \u201cmay be a\nwhile before the extent of the damage\nto pumps, motors and other plant is realised.\u201d\nWith regards to impaired student\nwork resulting from the closed labo-ratories, Professor Welton confirmed\nto Felix that anyone whose work has\nbeen affected will have this taken into\naccount, stating as an example that\nmarks for undergraduate labs sessions\nwill be adjusted accordingly if neces-sary. Discussing the aid received during\nand after the flood, he praised the work\nof the Facilities Management team, remarking that they responded quickly to\naddress the problems and \u201chave been\nnothing but helpful\u201d.\nNick Roalfe admitted that it had been\na very difficult week and said that he\nwas determined to have the buildings reopened and fully operational as\nquickly as possible. He thanked Departmental staff for their support and\nadded that on Monday and Tuesday he\nand his team would having a full review\nof the floods and their responses to the\nflooding. He was particularly keen to\ninvestigate how they could communicate more quickly and efficiently with\nstudents to let them know about possible disruption to their schedules.\nImperial College Radio (IC Radio) was\nshut down by the Union last Tuesday\nevening after a \u201cmember of the public\u201d\ncomplained to the Rector about the use\nof racially offensive language during a\nbroadcast. A non-Imperial guest on an\nIC Radio show referred to a close friend\nas a \u201cPaki\u201d, which the College and\nUnion say breaks Imperial\u2019s regulations\ngoverning media content.\nA complaint was received by the Rector\u2019s office sometime on Tuesday and\nwas later forwarded to Union President\nAlex Kendall at approximately 17:30.\nIt alerted him to the complaint and told\nhim that, because of the seriousness of\nthe complaint, they expected him to take\naction on the situation immediately.\nKendall said that it was impossible\nfor him to avoid taking serious action,\n\u201cit broke College policy and it broke the\nUnion\u2019s policy, so we had to do something.\u201d In the Imperial College Union\nCode of Practice, which is agreed on\nwith the College, it says that \u201cprejudicial\nor pejorative reference to an individual\u2019s\nrace\u201d must be avoided.\nThe email from the Rector\u2019s office\nalso referred Kendall to relevant sections of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code,\nwhich, however, do not apply to IC Radio as it transmits online only.\nStation Manager Dan Fowler apologised for the language used, but said\nthat it was clear that the word was used\nwithout malice in reference to a close\nfriend. However, he accepted that its\nuse was inappropriate and reminded\nIC Radio members, in an email on\nWednesday, that \u201cthings that may seem\nlike \u2018banter\u2019 between friends may be\ntaken another way by someone else that\nis listening in.\u201d\nKendall, along with Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) Heather Jones listened to the relevant parts of the show\nbefore taking action and had decided\nthat the word was used \u201cinappropriately.\u201d Kendall said that they understood\nthe context the word was used in but\nadded that \u201cwe can\u2019t condone the use of\na racist comment.\u201d\nAttempts were made to contact senior members of IC Radio as the website was being shutdown but they were\nunable to reach them. The Union were\nable to shutdown the website as it is\nhosted on a Union server, an arrangement required of all Clubs & Societies\nin the Union\u2019s Web Policy, recently\npassed in November last term. The\nWeb Policy also permits the President\nto \u201csuspend indefinitely\u201d a club or society\u2019s website. The policy notes that\nthe Union is \u201cultimately liable\u201d both legally and to the College for the content\non Clubs & Societies\u2019 websites, which\nKendall said makes it necessary for the\nUnion to be able to remove potentially\noffensive content.\nWhen asked why the Union did not remove the recording of the radio show in\nquestion, instead of bringing down the\nwhole site, he said that he wanted to be\nreassured that there wasn\u2019t further offensive content on the site. At a meeting\nwith Dan Fowler on Wednesday he says\nhe was reassured of this and the website\nwas allowed to come back online.\nIn March 2010 a student radio programme at the University of Glasgow\nwas taken off the air after the presenters \u201cused numerous swear words and\nexplicitly discussed sexual activities.\u201d\nThe entire website, however, was not\nshut down.\nKendall also added that shutting down\nthe entire website was a strong gesture\nthat signaled \u201chow seriously [the Union]\nconsiders racially offensive language.\u201d\nThe Station Manager Dan Fowler, as\nwell as the person who made the comment and the host of the radio show in\nquestion, have personally written to the\nRector to apologise for the comments\nmade on air and have asked for those\napologies to be passed on to the person\nwho made the complaint.\nIC Radio is implementing a new system to ensure that offensive content is\nnot uploaded to the website. Radio hosts\nwill be asked to manually upload their\nshows, currently it is automatic, and to\nconfirm before doing so that it doesn\u2019t\ncontain anything \u201cdodgy\u201d. Fowler reminded IC Radio members to use their\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d when broadcasting.\nNo further disciplinary action is being\ntaken. IC Radio\u2019s listening figures are\nnot believed to have been affected by\nthe shutdown...\nEditorial: Page 18\nUnion IC Radio offline after \u201cmember of public\u201d\ncomplains about racially offensive term\nWebsite back online\nfollowing day\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX\n34\nFood Editor: Dana Li\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSpend your moolah on Mooli\u2019s\nGastronomical Musings\nVicky says:\nEvery so often I open the fridge and get a good look\nat the bulb in the back. The fridge is empty. The\ncupboard is bare. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s some nursery rhyme to that effect. Then you spot a weirdly\nshaped clingfilmy entity living behind that jar of jala-penos from that Mexican night that you don\u2019t quite\nremember. Mmm Cheese. Mouldy five-month old\ncheese. Possibly Cheddar... maybe Parmesan; it\u2019s\nhard to tell. Can one change into another? But yes,\nfood. Mmm... but wait, is this weird? Scrapping the\nblue-ish hue off with a knife, I wonder if I should be\nfeeling guilty and worry about any freaky diseases\nI might contract from the cheese on the toast I\u2019m\nabout to have have. And for that matter the bread\u2019s\nlooking a bit dodgy too. Ahh well. It\u2019s not so bad\nas the chicken I cooked last week and ate yester-day. All in all I think I\u2019m helping my immune system.\nI mean, what\u2019s life without a challenge once in a\nwhile? Don\u2019t you just love the 30 second rule?\nSituated just off Shaftsbury Avenue in the\nheart of the West End, a district known for its\nwide variety of theatres and eateries, Mooli\u2019s\nis a small, minimalistic and trendy restaurant\nwhich stands out from the crowd by serving\nfood that\u2019s a little bit different. Fed up with the\ncuisine wrongly assumed to be \u2018Indian\u2019 in London, *cough* Brick Lane, Mooli\u2019s is the brainchild of two former bankers who saw a gap in\nthe market for cheap authentic Indian food on-the-go. For this reason you won\u2019t find a tikka\nmasala or anything of that sort at Mooli\u2019s!\nInstead Mooli\u2019s speciality are the wraps they\noffer in five flavours, which the owners claim\nwere inspired by travelling the length and\nbreadth of India, from Delhi to Goa in search\nof the best street food on offer. This is shown in\nthe menu which contains flavours from all over\nIndia, replicated at their Frith street address by\na chef, or mooli-master as he\u2019s known, whose\nCV includes stints in various 5-star hotels and\neven a Michelin-starred restaurant. Each roll is\ntechnically a Rumali roti a kind of Indian bread,\nwhich translated into English literally means\nhandkerchief bread due to its extreme thin-ness. Each roll is made from specially mixed\nflour, made on a wedge press machine exported\nall the way from Texas which was originally\nintended for the mass production of tortillas.\nAs someone who used \u2018make-your-own\u2019 fajita\nkits, with their tough, chewy and rough textured wraps, I could immediately taste that this\nbread was something new and different.\nI first ordered the Keralan Beef Mooli. The\nsoft thin freshly-made wholewheat bread surrounded tender chunks of coconut and Malabar\nspice marinated beef and seemed to melt in my\nmouth. If a Mooli wrap could be compared to\nanything it would probably be a shawarma roll.\nHowever, unlike a shawarma roll where the\nmeat is the main attraction, the salad just fills\nspace and the bread usually has the texture of\ncardboard, what puts a Mooli far ahead in the\nfast food stakes is the way that all the different\ncomponents in the wrap contribute to the eating\nexperience. In the beef wrap, for example, the\nbeef was joined in the wrap by a fresh cucumber\nraita and a tomato and onion salad. The combination of the black pepper and other spices in\nthe sauce, the soothing effect of the yoghurty\nraita and the juicy salad results in a meal perfect\nfor warming you up on cold winter\u2019s night.\nFeeling up for something a bit different, I was\nrecommended the Goat Mooli by the friendly\nstaff. This wrap contained pieces of goat curried in a traditional Punjabi way with a tomato\nonion mix and a hint of lime juice. For those\nwho have never tried goat before it is very\nsimilar to lamb or mutton, with a stronger more\nmusky taste. The meat was once again perfectly tender and piping hot, having been freshly\ncooked just before, the sauce however was\nspicier than the beef.\nFor the vegetarians out there, Mooli\u2019s offer\ntwo wraps: chickpea or paneer. I tried the latter,\nHello little pomegranate, come into my tummy...\nWhen the hooplah over Brick Lane just gets too much\nwhich contained a light shredded Indian cheese,\nspiced with a panch phoran 5 spice blend typical of eastern India, grated carrots and a crunch\nof mixed leaf salad. This wasn\u2019t personally to\nmy taste as I\u2019m a firm believer that a wrap has\nto have some sort of meat in it but I did fall\nin love with the deliciously refreshing mango\nlassi with a subtle hint of ginger that I washed\nit all down with.\nSo you\u2019re probably thinking that Mooli\u2019s,\nwith its Central London location, insistence\non quality ingredients, professional chef and a\npainstaking attention to detail when it comes to\ntheir food and flavours, would be out of range\nof a student\u2019s budget and exorbitantly higher\nthan a run of the mill fast-food joint. But that\u2019s\nwhere you\u2019re wrong. Possibly the most surprising thing about Mooli\u2019s is how cheap the food\nis. For under a fiver you can purchase a Mooli\nwhich would easily fill you up, but if you\u2019re\nworking to a budget I thoroughly recommend\nthe Mini Moolis which are in the region of \u00a33.\nSo if you ever find yourself in Soho, hungry,\nfed up with Chinatown and trying to avoid\nthe tourists, take your copy of Felix along and\nclaim a free mango lassi with your meal.\nMooli\u2019s 50 Frith Street, Soho.

Personally, and\nunsurprisingly (being a wannabe food critic)\nmy favorite part was the food. So again I have\nanother gem of a recipe to share!\nTartiflette\nFor those of you that ski, I\u2019m sure you are\nfamiliar with this. Really, is there anything\nmuch better than coming after a long day on\nthe slopes, grabbing a pint and a decent bit of\ntartiflette? No, didn\u2019t think so.\nIt\u2019s very simple, to make this for at least four\npeople all you need is a bag of potatoes (1.5 kg)\nan onion, a knob of butter, some bacon (about\n3-4 rashers) and a whole Reblechon. This is a\nFrench round cheese available in most super-markets. (If you can\u2019t find Reblechon, then\nGruyere or Emmenthal can work just as well\ntoo).\nPreheat the oven to gas 5 or around 200\u00b0C.\nNow wash the potatoes and slice into 1 cm\nstrips. Boil for about 5-10 minutes in boiling\nwater with a pinch of salt.\nNext, dice the onion finely and chop the bacon into lardons before frying these together\nwith a nice knob of butter in an ovenproof medium depth frying pan. Once the onion and bacon is suitably fried (not \u2018caramelized\u2019), layer\nthe potatoes on top so the whole of the pan is\ncovered. Season well.\nGet your Reblechon and cut the whole thing\ninto strips, but remember to leave the rind on.\nPut the strips of cheese over the potatoes and\nput in the oven for 20 minutes so it melts com-pletely. It\u2019s done!\nServe with a fresh green salad topped with\nFrench vinaigrette with a buttered chunk of a\nrustic baguette. Perfect.\nThere you go, you have a creamy, gooey and\nvery filling meal that will make you want to hit\nthe slopes. Guaranteed. Not long until December then.

Although we\u2019re using the term \u2018adorable\u2019 rather loosely\nbehind.\nThe mixture of drama, black humour\nand sheer tragedy this show balanced\nrarely faltered and makes the show\none of the most consistent I have ever\nseen over 5 seasons. This is mostly due\nto the wonderful cast rarely putting a\nfoot wrong, with a great script to back\nthem up. Surprising I have managed to\nget this far without mentioning one of\nthe most complex female characters to\nhave appeared on TV, played by the talented Rachel Griffiths (presently stuck\nin the mire that is Brothers and Sisters)\nwhose Brenda was often the highlight\nof the show. I cannot emphasize how\nmuch I would recommend watching\nthis show if you didn\u2019t have a chance\nthe first time around (I suspect for\nmany of you, you would have been in\nsingle digits). With one of the best finales of all time this is a show rich with\nlayered characters who are unafraid to\nbe selfish and cruel to each other while\nstill being engaging and ultimately\nsympathetic.\nOur HBO-fest continues\nContinuing our series on Sky Atlantic, Vicky Jeyaprakash and Navid Nabijou\ndice with death with two of the edgiest shows in recent years\nT\nhe genius of Alan Ball knows\nno bounds, writes Vicky\nJeyaprakash, and Six Feet Under is a perfect example. It was the story\nof a dysfunctional family of undertakers\nwhose lives unfold while dealing with\nthe day-to-day reality of death. The series normalised the grim reality of death\nin their lives while the characters railed\nagainst it by embracing life. In doing so\nthey indulged in various forms of sex,\ndrugs and human pettiness. The intelligence of the writing however never\nlet this slip into gratuitousness and was\ndealt with, with such a deft hand and sly\nhumour that it was a thing of beauty (un-like the kickass True Blood).\nThe excellence of the cast cannot be\ndownplayed with the incredible Michael C Hall (Dexter) and Peter Krause\n(Sports Night) playing the two brothers\nwho ran the Fischer funeral home after\nthe death of their father, with Francis\nConroy playing their highly strung matriarch who was trying to keep the family together. With a confused younger\nsister and warring business partner\nto battle, the series was never shy of\ndrama, with each week beginning with\nthe death of a person, which was sometimes brutal but often amusingly ordi-nary. In fact, death frequently took on a\nsurreal element with corpses speaking\nand ghosts of past characters haunting\nthe family. This conceit was oddly not\ngenerally played for scares but for grim\nhumour with the characters who now\nknew all mocking those that were left\n\u201cIt was the story of\ndysfunctional family\nof undertakers\nwhose lives unfold\nwhile dealing with\nthe day-to-day\nreality of death.\u201d\nP\nerhaps no other series to date has\nhad a greater impact on television\nas The Sopranos, writes Navid\nNabijou. Exploding onto the airwaves in\n1999, it came as a massive shock; never\nbefore had a show of such consistently\nhigh quality been witnessed. In that\nsense, it set the precedent for all that fol-lowed.

The barrier has not been broken since 2008.\nEgypt is not close to being amongst the top exporters in the region, so its inability to distribute its own\noutput is not disconcerting. Trouble does arise however due to fears of the Suez Canal closing.\nThe artificial channel is operated and maintained\nby the government of Egypt and is one of the main\nforms of transportation from Asia into Europe. Its\nclosure would mean an extremely unfavourable detour by navigating around Africa, adding on average\n6,000 miles to a journey. This would undoubtedly\nsomewhat stem the transportation of oil to Europe.\nPerhaps of more important is the precedent being\nsetbytheEgyptianprotests.Wavesofanti-government\nsentimentarebeingfeltinotherMiddle-Easternstates\nsuch as Algeria and Yemen. There is concern that this\ndomino-like effect will be the source of contagion to\nthe oil-rich nation of Saudi Arabia. Should the future\nprove this concern to be true, then the price of oil is\nsure to spike much higher levels.\nDow Jones Industrial Average back\nup over 12,000\nThe DJIA, the index that tracks 30 of the largest corporations in America, including Microsoft, Coca-Cola\nand 3M, has closed at 12,040 on Tuesday \u2013 its highest level since 2008. This is a significant achievement and was brought about by several firms beating analysts\u2019 estimates of earnings, among which\nwas UPS. Some analysts suggest that we are entering a period of sustained growth in the markets\nafter US manufacturing figures show the highest\npace increase in January compared to the previous\nsix years.\nThe other day, you might have received an\nemail from the Careers Advisory Service informing you that Imperial is one of the lucky\nuniversities selected to test-drive a new Bloomberg Assessment Test (BAT) for free. \u201cHurry\nnow! In the future, there will be a fee for taking this test,\u201d it said. First thoughts: \u201cWhat the\n\u2026?\u201d So employers now want students to pay\nfor taking a recruitment test? What\u2019s next?\nPaying for interviews? And why introduce a\nfurther barrier to entry for those from less well-off backgrounds? Felix caught up with Gerald\nWalker, Managing Director Europe at Bloomberg Ventures, to seek clarification.\nAptitude tests are nothing new; most graduate\nrecruiters in the UK already use numerical and\nverbal reasoning tests provided by companies\nsuch as the SHL Group or Kenexa. However,\nWalker explained that the BAT is specifically\ndesigned to test skills and knowledge relevant\nto careers in the financial services sector. It\u2019s a\n3-hour, multiple-choice test consisting of 150\nquestions in 12 sections covering everything\nfrom numerical and verbal reasoning, through\nto ethics and specific areas of finance and eco-nomics. The questions are designed to be practical rather than theoretical. Candidates are given comprehensive feedback and can compare\nthemselves against their peers from across the\nglobe. Students from Imperial will be able to\nsee how they rank compared to their peers from\ntop universities in places like Singapore or the\nUS. Comparisons are done by subject area, so\nthat those who are not studying finance are not\ndisadvantaged.\nThe test scores are also put into an anonymous\ndatabase for employers, who will be able to sift\nthrough the records based on different criteria\n(e.g. test scores, language skills, degree subject)\nand express interest in candidates to whom they\nwould like to be introduced.The candidate then\nreceives an email along the lines of \u201cWould you\nbe interested in applying to Deutsche Bank?\u201d.\nBloomberg will charge employers a fee of approximately \u00a360 per introduction, and this is\nwhere they are looking to derive the majority of\nrevenue from this venture.\nOn the subject of charging students, Walker\nexplained, \u201cOf course, students are not brimming with cash these days, we know that. Right\nnow the BAT is free, so students have nothing\nto lose, apart from spending 3 hours less down\nthe pub. We reserve the right to charge in the\nfuture, but that is mostly to cover administration costs and to prevent people from signing\nup for the test and then not turning up.\u201d The\nlikely fee is going to be in the region of \u00a330-60.\n\u201cWill students still be able to apply for a job at\nBloomberg without taking this test?\u201d we asked.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s entirely voluntary,\u201d Walker reassured\nus. Although Bloomberg themselves will be using BAT for their recruitment, the test is being\nintroduced more as a revenue-generating venture rather than solely for internal purposes. \u201cIt\nmay well be that in the future, the BAT score\nwill become something that people will want to\nadvertise on their CVs,\u201d Walker added.\nOn their website, Bloomberg claims that candidates will be able to advertise their BAT score\nto 20,000 companies through their database. At\nfirst glance, this seems like bragging. However, Bloomberg does have a vast client base\nwithin the financial industry, built up over the\nyears through their existing service offerings. It\nis these companies that Bloomberg will reach\nout to. This will enable smaller employers (e.g.\nhedge funds) to tap into a global pool of talent more easily. Right now, these companies\nfind it more difficult to do campus recruitment,\nas they don\u2019t have easily recognisable brands.\nThe BAT score will also enable bright students\nfrom less acclaimed universities to advertise\ntheir qualities to big employers who might at\nthe moment be concentrating their campus recruitment efforts on a few top institutions. The\nBAT tests will be run on university campuses\nand Bloomberg is open-minded about the types\nof universities they approach; it\u2019s not just for\nthe elite. Of course, it is likely that success rates\nwill be higher at top institutions.\nWhat if you do badly on the test? Will 20,000\ncompanies then think you are not employ-able? \u201cCandidates will have complete control\nover their data. If they had a bad day, they can\nalways retake the test, or they can have their\nscore removed from the database, so they will\nnot forever be stuck with a bad score,\u201d Walker\nexplained.\nWhat does this all mean for students who are\nlooking to bag themselves a well-paid City job?\nThe brightest of the bright will welcome the sim-plification: take one test, reach many employers.\nThe rest of us might feel a little intimidated\nabout the prospect of being ranked and compared to thousands of graduates across the globe.\nA complete rip-off or a shortcut to your dream job?\nWill we ever see people advertising their BAT scores on CVs as a standard? Some studens may feel helpless among the competition\nLucie Jichova\nProtesters making themselves heard across Egypt\n\u201cComparisons are done\nby subject area, so\nthat those who are not\nstudying finance are not\ndisadvantaged.\u201d\nAsian inflationary pressures\nManufacturing data from a multitude of Asian nations has refreshed fears of increased inflationary\nenvironments in those countries. This has prompted\nexpectation that india will increase rates by as much\nas 25 basis points in March.\nSome analysts expect this trend of increased inflation to continue markedly in the near future as\nprices of commodities, materials and food show little sign of a slow down.\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Even though\nOxbridge might be the \u201celite\u201d darlings\nof league tables and Hollywood writers\nneeding a back story for their British accented characters, what my friend failed\nto realise was that it\u2019s not any kind of\nuniversity prestige that defines us, it\u2019s\nthe overall experience that we make\nof our time here. Centuries of tradition\ndon\u2019t matter one iota when students and\nstaff band together to make not only Imperial, but universities all over the country a better place to learn, study and have\na great time.\nPeople like my friend shouldn\u2019t be\nlording it over what they consider to be\nlesser universities, because, in the end,\nwhat defines lesser? Not being bound\nby archaic drinking rules? Similarly we\nshouldn\u2019t look down upon those lower\ndown the league table just because we\nmight have bigger lasers. We\u2019ve all got\nthe same thing to offer, and that\u2019s the\nstudent experience.\nBut on the other hand, I hear a lot of\npeople complain about Imperial. From\nthe chap last week about the human-rights-opposing sex ratio, or the colleague next to me shouting about how he\ncan\u2019t do his \u201cdamn proof by induction,\nand why are they setting us this much\nwork?\u201d The more I hear this, the more I\nfeel it makes us sound as if we\u2019re all unhinged maniacs with the only clubbing\ngoing on being that of the seal variety.\nIt\u2019s just wrong.\nEqually, there\u2019s so much more to Imperial than relentless deadlines. If you\nthink you\u2019re regretting choosing to\ncome here \u2013 perhaps because on Facebook Mr. X devotes every passing night\nto posting banterous photos of the latest\nunion rave at Loughborough, or Miss. Y\nupdates her statuses all the time about\nhow she\u2019s \u201ctotally in love with Southampton\u201d \u2013 just take a step back and\nconsider the breadth of what\u2019s going on\naround campus right now.\nEven easier, just hop on over to the\nnews section of this very paper. \u201cOh I\nsee,\u201d you more than likely aren\u2019t thinking at the moment, \u201cMr. Co\u2013News Editor has just written this so he can big up\nhis section.\u201d\nWell, that\u2019s only half true.

This is why I love the events\nof December\u2019s Life Sciences protests.\nStudents and staff joined together to\nmake a real difference. They want to\nCambridge punts\nmake a change for the better, which really does transcend the stereotypes that\nso often beleaguer Imperial.\nThe opinion that this university is\nfull to the brim of awkward nerds is as\nwrong as the opinion that Cambridge is\nmade up entirely of Tory voting toffs;\nsure you\u2019ll find some, but ultimately,\nin this day and age, as more and more\nstudents from all walks of life find themselves reaching the higher levels of edu-cation, such trivialisations fall flat. Stereotypes are just a punchline. You\u2019re at\nuniversity, with a wealth of education at\nyour fingertips, and that\u2019s what matters.\nSure, we can big ourselves up when\nwe want, we\u2019re good at science.

    "content": "FELIX\nGood evening peaty goodness, fancy having a drink with me tonight?\nN\not everybody may agree\nwith me, but is there a\nmore satisfying tipple\nthan a whisky? The aro-mas, the warmth, the fla-vour, come to think of it, there are few\ndrinks I would rate more than a good\nscotch. Whilst its taste is acquired and\noccasionally referred to as a kin to petrol\nby philistines, this makes it even more\nrewarding when you begin to appreciate\nit, yet despite these points, perhaps the\nbest feature of whisky is its versatil-ity. Whisky is great for mixing as well\ndrinking neat, bourbon and coke, has a\nfar more complex and enjoyable taste\nthan its vodka alternative and any kind\nof whisky (preferably nothing too ex-pensive) with ginger ale is also highly\nagreeable. On top of that, the drink is\nfairly good value compared to its distant\ncousin brandy for equivalent qualities.\nSo where to begin? Well, there are\nthree main groups of whisky: Scotch,\nfrom Scotland of course, Irish and\nAmerican, mainly in the form of bour-bon. Irish and Scotch whiskies tend to\nbe malt based, where as bourbons are\nmade from rye and must be distilled in\nKentucky (surprisingly, despite the common misconception, Jack Daniel\u2019s is not\na Bourbon) and whilst Scotches are usually the most subtle in flavour, Bourbons\nhave a far more intense taste due to the\nrye, making it more suitable for mixing.\nThen there\u2019s the whole blended/single\nmalt distinction to deal with. In short, a\nsingle malt is made from a single dis-tillate, where as a blended whisky is\na combination of two or more single\nmalts. Blended whiskies are cheaper to\nmake than single malts when producing a drinkable whisky and are usually\ncheaper as well in the shops, though\nsome of the dearest drams around are\nalso blended too, e.g. Chivas Regal and\nJohnny Walker Blue Label. There isn\u2019t\nany single bourbon as they are too fiery\nby themselves.\nWhat makes a good whisky? I\u2019m not\na connoisseur, so I\u2019m probably not the\nbest person to ask. Personally, the single most important thing I look for in a\nwhisky is how smooth it is, i.e. lack of\nburning when tasted, ease of drinking\netc, this is one thing that cheap whiskies\ntend not to do that well. Another quality\nto have is a long finish (not aftertaste;\nthat gives the wrong connotations),\nwhere one can still taste the whisky after\ndrinking as if it were still in their mouth.\nThis isn\u2019t the most important feature of\na whisky though; Maker\u2019s Mark, a nice,\nsmooth bourbon, has a remarkably short\nfinish. A good thing to remember is that\nif you\u2019re lumbered with a bottle of whisky you\u2019re not too keen on, you can use it\nfor mixing, though to do this to a single\nmalt is seen as sacrilege.\nTeacher\u2019s Highland Cream:\nCheap and nasty. On the rare and depraved occasion when I have drunk this,\nI could not clear my mind of the image\nof an overweight Glaswegian wearing\na soiled and frayed wife beater\u2019s vest\nstirring a massive steaming cauldron of\nthe devil\u2019s sweat. With a rough and foul\ntaste, my humble advice is to resist the\ntemptation of a cheap drink and avoid.\nDown in one? I think not...\nChristian Franke advises you on how to expand your drinking horizons\nJohnnie Walker Black:\nWhilst at the bottom of the Johnnie\nWalker family tree, this is a perfectly\nacceptable blended scotch. Highly intense and a tad fiery, it\u2019s probably best\nto add a dash of soft mineral water to\ndilute and bring out the flavours more\nso. Look out for the red label; it\u2019s made\nespecially for mixing by having high\nrye content.\nGlenfiddich 12 years old Single Malt:\nIn short, it\u2019s the commercial single malt.\nSmooth with a nice, easy drinking taste.\nPerhaps not the most distinct of scotches\nin flavour, but it\u2019s still enjoyable to have\nand is sold at just at about every outlet\nwith usually the lowest price tag of the\nsingle malts. The adverts are too similar to Marlboro Man ones for my liking\nthough.\nGlen Moray Single Malt:\nA very mysterious scotch, mainly in that\nthere\u2019s no sign of its age on the bottle,\nyet despite this, I\u2019d still recommend it. It\ncould be marginally smoother, though it\ndoes have a pleasant and light flavour. If\nyou feel like treating yourself, you can\nbuy a bottle of this stuff in Oddbin\u2019s for\n\u00a318, which is very good value.\nLaphroaig 10 year old Single Malt:\nVery nice. In fact very, very, very. nice.\nJoking aside, this scotch has a very dis-tinct, rich flavour with an incredibly\nlong finish and is extremely smooth.\nQuite simply, it\u2019s brilliant. Apparently\nit\u2019s also Prince Charles\u2019 favourite dram\ntoo.\nearlycj5/flickr\nMeat. That quintessential ingredient\nof all meals. The point of any fare. Or\nso I\u2019ve been told. I love food; lunch,\nbrunch, pudding, tea, tapas and amuse-bouche are all held in fond regard. I\ncould however easily forgo meat. I\u2019m\nnot a vegetarian. I would definitely\nnot want to be part of that fringe group,\nthough they have my sympathies. Having seen the abuse my sister puts up with\nfrom all you rabid animals, I wouldn\u2019t\ntarnish myself with that brush.\nI love a good roast chicken and apple\nand pork sausages are a favourite but\nred meat generally holds no candle to\nthe allure of an aubergine melanzane or\na good cheese board. This I often find is\nhard for people (and when I say people,\nI mean boys) to appreciate. Resisting the\nsmell of bacon or the juiciness of a medium rare steak was never hard.\nWeirdly I do find people enjoying\ntheir carnivorous meal fascinating\nthough. The choice of cuts, how it\u2019s\ncooked, and the sauces are endless\nseem to add to the theatre a good meal\nshould have. The sheer enthusiasm of\npeople who love meat is overwhelming\nand the ability to appreciate the wonders of flesh has never seemed so important than at Rodizco Rico in Westbourne Grove.\nBrazilians adore their meat and if you\never get a chance to visit, you can order your meat by the kilo in restaurants.\nThis place is as close as you can get\naround these parts. It\u2019s not cheap at \u00a323\na head but it is an all-you-can-eat meat\nfeast and I have never seen a group of\nguys quite so enthusiastic about forking\nout so much money for food. The basis\nof the meal is barbecued meat where\nthe meat is rotated on giant skewers and\nservers walk around the room cutting off\npieces to serve to customers. The sheer\ndrama of waving around metal stakes\nis thrilling and though not somewhere\nI would encourage non-meat eaters to\nvisit and for those of us who enjoy a bit\nof drama, it\u2019s fun to watch.\nFor the rest of you who love meat it\nis the best value for money you could\nimagine. Rump steak, fillet steak, sau-sage, chorizo, chicken wings, chicken\nhearts, lamb shank; the choice is crazy\nand this doesn\u2019t even allow for the fact\nthat the meat is tender, soft and never-ending. There is no gimmick at work\nhere and a friend who rocked up with\nonly 15 minutes to spare at the end of\nour two hour table reservation was\nserved with a towering pillar of meat\nthat reminded me of some kind of renaissance feast. Definitely for all you\ncavemen out there.\nRodizco Rico, 111 Westbourne\nGrove, W2 4UW.\nVicky Jeyaprakash\nSo you think you can eat? Meet the meat challenge\nThe sheer drama of\nwaving around metal\nstakes is thrilling...\nFOOD\nFood Editor: Dana Li\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36 Friday 04 february 2011\n\n"

Most having started ice hockey last October, a few with\nno skating experience at all. Coach/Charitable\nImperial Alumni Dave Coolegem soon instilled\nin them the essentials of ice hockey and sowed\nthe seeds for success. The B-team is in its third\nyear, playing in Division 3 of the British Universities Ice Hockey Association and has competitors in all the top universities of the UK,\nincluding Oxford for the first time this year.\nThe opposition, Southampton Spitfires, are a\none year veteran team with a crop of good play-ers, the result of having no team in the division\nimmediately above. They also had one win under their belts, a convincing 13-5 match against\nBristol Lions. Their number 42 was clearly the\nstar player, credited with 7 goals alone he was\nthe man to mark.\nDespite the impressive results the Devils\u2019\nwere not intimidated and played well, often\noutnumbered in the neutral and offensive zones.\nAs our first match of the season, against a tough\nopponent the aim was to play defensively and\nthis was achieved very well. The first period\nwas a time for learning our enemy, we held out\nfor 6 minutes until their second line had had a\nchance to size up our team and seized the initiative with an unassisted goal from 62. The Devils\u2019 regrouped but conceded again 5 minutes\nlater as the result of some close-combat around\nthe net, scored by 69, assisted by 42. The game\nreturned to an even balance, with some good\nruns into the offensive zone but sadly the forwards couldn\u2019t convert these opportunities into\ngoals. The period ended with a final goal from\n42, assisted by 69.\nThe Devils\u2019 defence had played consistently\n\u2013 chasing down break-outs and preventing open\nshots on goal, but once the play had opened up\nthe teamwork broke down and men were going\nunmarked. The first intermission was the perfect time to remedy this, with insightful words\nfrom Coach Coolegem and an urging to shoot\non their goal much more often. The second period went much better, with good coordination\nestablished between D(efence) and more aggressive play in the offensive zone. Fundamentals were remembered with good play being set\nup and fewer risks taken. The mid-point of the\nperiod was marked by Devils\u2019 Centre Eugene\nLau being called for Boarding (checking an opponent into the boards head first) and spending\ntwo minutes in the sin bin. The Power Kill was\nhandled calmly, with all four players on the ice\nworking hard to clear the puck and close down\nthe shooting lanes. The return to even teams\nsaw more possession by the Devils\u2019, special\nmention going to Defender Matt Nolan for\nsome inspired runs into the offensive zone but\nsadly no goals.\nBy the third period both teams were waning\nsomewhat. The Spitfires were determined to\nincrease their lead, but the Devils\u2019 hadn\u2019t lost\nall their fight. More spirited attempts to score\nwere lead by Rob Barakat and Sofie Liljegren\nin particular. Two more goals were conceded\naround ten minutes in, but the play returned to\nstalemate leaving the end score a reasonable\n5-0 win for the Spitfires. Having come away\nworse in the past, veteran players pointed out\nthis was largely damage limitation and there\nwould be plenty of opportunities for convincing wins in the remainder of the term. The\nDevils B-Team are already looking forwards to\ntheir next match on Saturday against OxfordWomens\u2019 at the Oxford Ice Rink.\nStefan Bauer\nIce Hockey\nMen\u2019s 2nd 0 - 5 Southampton 2nd\nHandballers win\nSouthern University\ntournament\n...Continued from Back Page\na goal offering 6m\u00b2 of target area is too small\nand wasted potentially decisive counter attacks,\ngranting Imperial a close victory.\nWith no time to analyse the mistakes made\nin the second game, IC was scheduled to face\nCranefields University from what they call\n\u201cbuzzing Milton Keynes\u201d on their Universities website in the next fixture. Since the newly\nfounded UKI women\u2019s Handball team was only\nnarrowly defeated by our opponents women\u2019s\nteam in their first ever matches, there was more\nthan enough motivation to do well against this\nunfamiliar opponent. Despite trailing by 2 goals\nfor a short period of time, the Eagles managed to\nget back into the game and secured a close victory in a game that should have been a one-sided\naffair in favour of Imperial.\nAfter a long but productive break, the Imperial\nEagles had to face their arch enemy UCL, who\nhad not dropped a point in the tournament either\nat that stage, in the last game of the day. With\neveryone fully aware of the tension between the\nlocal rivals, it was certain to be a worthy and\neventful final for this new competition. Regardless of the poor performance in the previous\ngames, Imperial was on top of their game from\nthe first minute and established a 2-goal lead in\nthe crucial stages of the game. In the last min-utes, the UCL left-back challenged the Eagles\u2019\ngoalkeeper, who finally managed to find his\nform when it mattered the most, for a loose ball,\nwhich resulted in the Imperial number one chipping 3 teeth. Entirely unimpressed by the loss\nof enamel, the Imperial Eagles managed to hold\noff their rivals desperate attempts to score a last\nminute goal and secured their title in style.\nIt was a truly memorable day that accurately\ndisplayed Imperials superiority on the court,\nbut leaves questions as to whether the team has\nenough consistency to win the draining tournaments in Nottingham and Lyon.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX 3\nAngry students told to\nhop off \u2018Hopper Bus\u2019\nNo prior warning given, says Medic President\nSELKIRK RULES!\n...and regulations\nDisgruntled students have this week\nfound themselves unable to use the NHS\nTrust \u2018Hopper Bus\u2019 service, a shuttle service that runs between NHS Trust sites.\nThe service, piloted in April 2009, had\nuntil recently been a useful form of free\ntransport for Imperial students, most\nnotably medical students, to and from\nNHS Trust Sites (Charing Cross, St\nMarys and Hammersmith hospitals) and\nthe South Kensington campus. Two buses used to run in a loop between these\nsites, providing the means for students\nand staff to get to teaching, meetings\nand club and society events. However,\nrecent changes have angered students.\nThe buses are smaller, no longer go to\nthe South Kensington campus and run\nfor fewer hours \u2013 changes that David\nSmith, ICSMSU President, highlighted\nwere not made clear to the student body\nprior to their enforcement.\n\u201cICSMSU has not been given any\ninformation about the change, but we\nunderstand that there is a new timetable\nwhich runs roughly from 8 to 6, rather\nthan from 7 to 9:30. The Single Decker\nhas become a minibus so there is less\nspace but it seems adequate. [The buses]\nnow only operate between individual\nsites (i.e. Charing Cross to St Marys\nHospital or Hammersmith Hospital to\nSt Marys Hospital etc) rather than going in a big circle. But this saves time\nas students no longer have to go through\nhospital sites on the way to their final\ndestination.\u201d\nJoanna Kefas, a second year medic,\nexpressed anger over the changes: \u201cThe\nhopper bus meant that I could get to\nImperial [South Kensington campus]\nquickly and for free. During [clinical]\nfirms it was the only way I even considered getting to St. Marys because the\nHopper took 15 minutes, whereas the\npublic bus took an hour. I also use it\nto get to society meetings and rehearsals \u2013 I could jump on the Hopper bus\nand know that I\u2019d actually get there on\ntime.\u201d\nAn NHS Trust spokesperson countered that there are now three buses running rather than two, and that the service\nis now more frequent and faster.\nHowever, a PhD student, Loretta Platt,\nsaid that the loss of the Charing Cross to\nSouth Kensington route, \u201cthe route we\nuse most,\u201d outweighed improvements\non other routes.\nThe service was never intended to\nbe used by non-clinical students. The\nonline timetable clearly states that the\nservice is for the use of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust staff only,\nfor \u201cofficial use in getting to or from\nTrust sites and meetings\u201d.\nDave Smith confirmed that he would\nbe raising the issue at the next Faculty\nof Medicine Medical Studies Committee, but sought to reassure students on\nclinical firms that they should not be affected by the changes: \u201cClinical students\nwho are on placements on one of the\nhospitals should still be able to use the\nservice if they have been issued with an\nNHS card at the beginning of their firm,\nalthough strictly it is only for staff.\u201d\nWhilst it is clear that non-clinical students were never supposed to use the\nHopper bus service in the first place, it\nwas of undeniable benefit to many Imperial students. With rising costs of liv-ing, students have less and less money\nto spend on transport between campus-es. The Hopper bus fulfilled a need for\nmany students, created by a lack of an\naffordable and reliable alternative form\nof transport between Trust sites.\nAfter several recent incidents in Selkirk\nHalls \u2013 mainly involving alcohol \u2013 the\nWardens have decided to implement\na series of rules regarding \u2018gatherings\u2019\nand noise levels late at night. These regulations request that students inform the\nwardens about gatherings so that they\ncan be \u2018approved\u2019 and have provoked\nconsternation amongst students there.\nStudents have been warned that if gatherings are not reported to Wardens, after\nrepeat offences, they may get fined.\nSeveral students who live in Selkirk\n(Selkirkians) have been charged with\ncommunity service and fines from the\nCollege Tribunal for the damage caused\nafter recent parties.\nThe Selkirkians who were given punishments were indignant; they felt that\nthey had no warning as no one had tried\ncoming to talk to them before. Some\nstudents feel patronised in regards to\nthe rule about staying quiet after 11pm.\nOne said, \u201cit literally felt as if I was nine\nyears old again.\u201d\nHowever, sub-wardens do not believe\nthat any of the rules introduced are new.\nSub-warden James Farley-Nicholls said\nthat they were a \u201cre-emphasis of the\npre-existing requirements for living in\nhalls.\u201d These requirements were set for\nall halls at the beginning of term and are\nsimply being re-enforced more rigorously he argues.\nHowever, many Selkirkians remain\ndisgruntled if not confused by these\nregulations. Many students are puzzled\nby the idea of having to report \u201cgatherings\u201d to their wardens, mainly because\nthey have no idea what a gathering is.\nEven though the wardens have approved\ntime spent in the kitchen, none of the\nresidents are sure as to when they would\nnotify the wardens. Most students stated\nsimply that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t think twice\u201d\nabout sending an email, as gatherings\naren\u2019t planned: \u201cThey just happen\u201d,\ncommented one resident.\nHowever, it seems that wardens are\nmore concerned about large parties,\nmainly involving alcohol,that would\nleave a large mess in the kitchens and\nthat the rules were only set due to complaints from residents and cleaners.\nThey only wished to be informed so\nthat they can ensure that any messes are\ntidied up after and that excessive noise\nwill be controlled.\nSome Selkirk residents that are not\nusually involved in such parties and\nincidents did feel that these new regulations did not affect them as the rules\nwere \u201conly directed at certain people\u201d.\nBut some do believe that the rules have\ncreated a \u201cculture of fear, that a warden\nwill walk in any time\u201d making it harder\nto just hang out in halls.\nOne of the most important questions\nhas to be: why only Selkirk? It seems\nthat only Selkirk has had their regulations reinforced, where one student was\n\u2018shocked\u2019 that it was only their halls.\nBut then again, it seems that only Selkirk have people throwing up in their\ncommon room, people breaking restric-tors on windows and wandering on fifth\nfloor balconies, spilling oil on the fourth\nfloor and inviting people who aren\u2019t\nfrom their halls, because no other hall\ndoes that, right?\nTo keep the peace, it seems that Selkirkans should be more considerate of\nother residents around them, whilst the\nSub-wardens should be more lenient\non \u201cgatherings\u201d within the halls. On a\npositive note, the Sub-wardens have\npromised,\u201cif things improve then the\nrequirements will be relaxed.\u201d But for\nnow, it seems its \u2018bed time, lights out\u2019\nfor Selkirk.\nKatherine Bettany\nAemun Reza\nOh yeah, that\u2019s right. A photo of the hall in question AND a famous landmark in the background. You\u2019re welcome Felix reader\nLet\u2019s be honest, Imperial, this photo really doesn\u2019t require a caption\nKatherine Bettany\nFriday 04 february 2011\nMiles Robertson\nJeez, get a room...\nKatherine Bettany\n\n"

The song\nstarts with tribal chanting before giving way to a rocking 1970s-indebted\nsection, and ends with a beautiful folk\ncoda. While all the component parts\nare good, it is essentially several short\nideas jammed together, and feels like it,\nresulting in a song that as a whole is\nstrangely forgettable.\nJamie Fraser\nSome people take music way too se-riously. Praise Jeebus then for bands\nlike The Eleven 37s. Mixing the fun\nvibes of funk with the raw energy of\nrock, they play party music of the best\nbreed, sure to get you dancing and\nleaving you with a smile on your face.\nWe spoke about crazy dancing, gig\nsize to satisfaction ratios and what\nthey\u2019ll bring on February 19th, when\nthey headline 19.02 .\nHave you guys always played funk?\nLuke (guitar, vocals): Stuff of that genre-ish. We all love the Chilli Peppers. We\nstarted off by doing Chilli Peppers covers and then started writing songs together and this is how it turned out. This\nended up being what we wanted to play.\nJamie (vocals, keyboard, crazy danc-ing): I think it took us a long time to get\nto what we wanted to do style wise.\nLuke: It was hard, because we\u2019re all\nquite different musicians, in terms of\nwhat we want to do. And we just try and\nfit that all in together.\nJamie: It works though. Because we all\nhave so many different ideas. We set\nfire to each other occasionally, if we\ndon\u2019t like an idea. But that\u2019s alright, you\nknow. The wounds heal. The scars are\nthere for a while\u2026\nLuke: I\u2019m trying to keep a straight face\nhere.\nWhat are some of your influences?\nLuke: We all have properly different\ninfluences. We have lots of different\nideas and we all have to decide together\nwhether we like it or not. It\u2019s difficult to\nmix and match.\nJamie: It\u2019s the perception of what we\nthink of funk.\nLuke: That\u2019s been an issue sometimes.\n19.02:Fun-loving funk\nWild funk rockers The Eleven 37s will bring their fun-filled funk\nparade to the first Felix Music Night on Saturday 19th Feburary\nSome people are expecting like James\nBrown or whatever. That\u2019s not really it.\nJamie: We see the fun side of the music.\nLuke: Mixing it all up, it\u2019s a good atmosphere to have. And we try to bring\npeople into it as much as we can.\nJamie: It\u2019s nice to do something differ-ent. We\u2019ve had 3 EPs now. The first one\nwas a mix of everything: a mish-mash\nof ideas. We were young. I think we\u2019re\nprogressing all the time.\nLuke: It\u2019s gonna keep changing. I dunno\nwhere we\u2019re gonna end up but we\u2019re just\ngonna keep writing.\nJamie: We definitely have an idea of\nwhere we\u2019re heading, but if we didn\u2019t\nprogress all the time, we\u2019d get bored\nof it. And then people would get bored\nof it. It\u2019s great to keep just writing new\nstuff all the time.\nDo you prefer big or small gigs?\nLuke: It kind of varies. We\u2019ve had a few\nover the past few months that have been\nreally quite big gigs. We played Proud\nCamden, we\u2019re playing it again at the\nend of February. We\u2019ve played some\nmuch smaller places. We started out\ndoing a lot, hitting the scene, just for\npractice. Just get our music to as many\npeople as we could. Really small places\nsometimes.\nJamie: It really does vary though. You\ncan play a massive venue and it can\nbe really amazing lighting and sound,\nbut just be an awful gig. You can play\na tiny little place, and the sound can be\nbrilliant in there. It\u2019s literally what happened the other week.\nLuke: Yeah at the Urban Bar. We went\nin there and the sound was just right on\nthe dot, and we played to 15-20 people\nand it was amazing. It was so much fun.\nJamie: We played Monto like the week\nbefore, which is a great venue, but we\njust didn\u2019t enjoy it as much.\nLuke: We couldn\u2019t get the sound quite\nright, and the crowd just wasn\u2019t as into it\nas we hoped they\u2019d be.\nJamie: It\u2019s all about the atmosphere,\nit\u2019s what we thrive on at these shows,\nall the time. If they\u2019re not enjoying it,\nwe\u2019re not gonna enjoy it. Simple as\nthat. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re always so\ncrazy on stage.\nThe Eleven 37s getting all funk\u2019d up and spreading mad love\nLuke: You should get a load of this guy.\nJamie: Crazy dancing.\nLuke: When we started off it was difficult getting the performance right. We\nwere young, and scared of people. Now\nwe\u2019re hitting our stride, getting some\ngood performances in. Before getting\nthe performances right, you have to get\nthe right sound, you need to be able to\nplay it right.\nJamie: You have to be happy with it.\nIt\u2019s exactly like when we\u2019re writing as\nwell, four of us can love a song. This\nhappened the other week, Luke doesn\u2019t\nmind me saying this. Because I can read\nhis mind it\u2019s fine. But we had a song that\nwe all liked, but Luke wasn\u2019t too keen\non it. We had to drop it, because if you\ndon\u2019t all like it, it\u2019s pointless. You\u2019re\nnot gonna perform as a band. Four of\nus might perform, but that\u2019s not gonna\nhelp. All five need to be enjoying that\nsong to get the atmosphere across.\nLuke: With different backgrounds\nthere\u2019s always gonna be some disagree-ment. We just have to keep trying new\nideas and finding something everyone\nlikes. It turns out that when everyone\nlikes something, it\u2019s usually very good.\nJamie: That\u2019s definitely what\u2019s happened writing-wise over the past year.\nWe released \u201cHere comes the storm\u201d\nabout a year ago, and we\u2019ve been promoting that for a year. In that time we\u2019ve\nwritten loads of songs but I think we\u2019ve\nonly taken two out of there cos not everyone\u2019s been comfortable with the\nsongs we\u2019ve written. It\u2019s good because\nthe response we\u2019ve been getting from\nthese new songs that have come out are\namazing. People are absolutely loving\nthem which is great.\n\u201cStrawberry Swing\u201d, that\u2019s a great one.\nAnd it\u2019s not a Coldplay reference, contrary to what people think.\nWhat will you guys bring to 19.02?\nJamie: The best music ever.\nLuke: The best.\nJamie: Ever.\nLuke: And some fun somewhere in the\nmix.\nJamie: Some fun, some dancing. I bring\nstrawberries to shows now. They\u2019re\ngood strawberries though. They did\ncomplain last time that they were in my\nshoe, but they were bought fresh! They\nwere quite nice.\nLuke: They were alright.\nJamie: Yeah they were good. Obama\u2019s\ncoming, actually. He said he\u2019s pretty\nexcited about it, he texts me about it.\nHe didn\u2019t want to put it in the news or\nanything.\nLuke: He didn\u2019t want to shout out about\nit.\nJamie: You don\u2019t want to do that, he\u2019s\njust gonna attract attention.\nLuke: He\u2019s just gonna turn up, stay in\nthe background with a hood up, so no\none spots him.\nJamie: Yeah I can see him in the office\nlike: \u201cAaaw yea\u201d and grooving. \u201cLovin\nthis\u201d.

    "content": "FELIX\n8\nELECTIONS\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCharlotte Ivison\nDeputy President\n(Welfare)\nW\nhat has been your biggest\nchallenge as Deputy President (Welfare)?\nEngaging students in welfare\nissues. Students at times don\u2019t\ntake their own welfare very seriously. Often when\nthey do need help they either don\u2019t know where\nto go or they choose to suffer in silence because\nof social perceptions. I think it\u2019s very easy at Imperial to prioritise academia. Admittedly when I\nwas a fresher I didn\u2019t take part in campaign weeks\nand I\u2019m still not sure if we\u2019re involving students\nenough through campaign weeks. But they are\nvery important and the issues that they highlight,\nlike sexual health in SHAG Week, will always be\nvital to student wellbeing.\nWhat\u2019s an average day like?\nI start the day at 10am, usually with checking and\nreplying to emails that I\u2019ve received. They\u2019re usually on a range of things from papers for College\nmeetings to student issues. I\u2019ll then spend some\ntime organising whatever campaign week I\u2019m\nworking on, which usually involves contacting appropriate charities and clubs to get involved, room\nbookings and ordering publicity materials. I\u2019ll usually do this with the appropriate welfare officer. In\nthe afternoon I may have a College committee, a\nmeeting with individual staff, a student consultation group that I\u2019ve organised or meet with an individual student who needs some help.\nWhat do you enjoy most about your job?\nI really enjoy being able to help students, both on\na representative level and individually when they\nhave a specific problem. It\u2019s very rewarding to feel\nlike you\u2019ve made a student\u2019s life better. Particularly\nin individual cases, you\u2019re working directly with a\nstudent and helping them through whatever issues\nhave come up, which are usually quite serious and\nhave large, life-changing consequences.\nBut also representing students on College committees and putting across their concerns and views\nis rewarding. The College do take student views on\nboard; they really do take welfare very seriously.\nAdmittedly the committees that I sit on are less\ncombative and less \u2018political\u2019 than the other sabbaticals have to sit on, but nonetheless it is great to\nfeel like the student view is being fed upwards and\nmaking real changes.\nWhat do you enjoy least?\nCommittee meetings can, at times, be a little te-dious. Sometimes you find yourself at a very long,\nvery unproductive meeting and you don\u2019t feel like\nyou\u2019re using your time to the benefit of students or\ndelivering them value-for-money. But it is essential\nto maintain student representation in all areas of\nCollege, the odd tedious meeting every now and\nagain is a small price to pay for that.\nDo you have any regrets about your time as\nDeputy President (Welfare)?\nI think at the beginning I shied away from tackling\ncertain problems head-on. When I first started the\nrole, I didn\u2019t have much experience in operating\nUnion finances and so I shied away from handling\nthe finances for the campaign weeks entirely my-self. Now that I\u2019ve gained more experience I\u2019ve\nstarted to do that and the result is that things run\nmore smoothly. So my only regret is not being\nmore confident in myself at the beginning.\nDo you have any advice for anyone considering\nrunning for Deputy President (Welfare)?\nMake sure that you actually care about student\nwelfare or you\u2019ll end up being bored. Not everyone\nhas that passion and concern for other people so\nbe sure that you do. Be prepared to take an active\nrole in defining your role and responsibilities. It\u2019s\na very young position, it\u2019s only two years old and\nso it\u2019s much less defined than say Deputy President (Clubs & Societies); the job description is still\nevolving. You\u2019ll have to make a decision about\nwhat direction to take the role in.\nAlso be prepared for the impact on your life of\nthe position. The way you work changes, it\u2019s much\ndifferent to your course. It\u2019s more rigid but also requires you to be more flexible. You have set office\nhours, which, unlike those lectures that you find\nboring, are definitely not optional. But you also\nneed to be more flexible because if there\u2019s something urgent, you have to be answerable; there are\nsome things that you can\u2019t put off until the week-end. Expect your social life to change too; you\u2019ll\nstart spending time with different people. It\u2019s a big\ncommitment.\nF\nor other people who are thinking\nabout running, what\u2019s the one thing\nyou wish you\u2019d known before you\nstarted?\nHow many meetings you attend! There\nhave been days, honestly, when I have sat in five\nor six meetings; I also have three-hour meetings\nonce in a while. Most people come into the position come from an undergraduate perspective, you\ndon\u2019t really get postgraduates applying for these\njobs, but you have to deal with both undergraduate\nand postgraduate issues, even if you\u2019re a postgraduate coming in you have to deal with undergraduate issues. And I underestimated that at first, but\nyou have a support team, and the GSA, and you\njust use your resources.\nHas it ever been a problem representing two\ndifferent groups of students with different\nneeds?\nYes, because undergraduate needs are very different from those of postgraduate students. It\u2019s very\ndifficult getting used to that. But that\u2019s why you\nhave the handover period [in July], to acclimatise\nto the different worlds.\nIs there any unfinished business that you really\nwant to get done by the end of the year?\nThat has to be the Feedback Policy, it has to succeed in creating a different mindset around feedback and coursework. The two go hand in hand so\nwe need to move away from the mindset: \u201cWe\u2019re\njust going to test the students\u201d. We need to create\nmore of a dynamic learning environment that ties\nthe coursework closely with the feedback. In a\nway, it\u2019s kind of an agreement between the lecturers and the students.\nWhat\u2019s a typical day as a DPE?\nSo I normally get in at 10am, make myself a nice\nlarge cup of coffee, sit in front of the computer and\ncheck my emails. Come midday-ish, that\u2019s usually\nwhen the committees usually start and I usually sit\non one or two a day.\nThat\u2019s a lot of committees\nYeah! Especially round November time, it\u2019s hor-rible. There\u2019s more like three or four a day. I\u2019m\nnot making this sound very appealing am I? But\nat the same time the position and Deputy President (Welfare) are quite new. It\u2019s only the second\nyear that they\u2019ve existed separately, so we\u2019re still\nforming the positions in a way. So what I\u2019ve tried\nto do is have a lot more contact with my Reps.\nSo I meet Departmental Representatives and my\nAcademic Affairs Officers constantly; we\u2019re trying to get more representatives input into what I\ndo, so that the policies that I\u2019m creating are responsive to student needs. I create a document\nand send it out to everyone and say, \u201cwhat do you\nthink?\u201d I\u2019ve tried to get that dynamic going. It\u2019s\nworking well but it needs to be continued and improved next year.\nWhat\u2019s your take, as DPE on the Life Sciences\ncuts?\nAlthough there are problems in the Department, the\nway that both College and Departmental management went about doing this was completely wrong.\nWe showed them data on how their decisions are\nflawed, on how their data was flawed, and we were\nbasically shut down. So the situation right now is\nthat we have to support their teaching review. We\ndon\u2019t want to be in the position where we just say,\n\u201cI told you so\u201d, so we\u2019re making sure they go about\nit right. Bottom line is, I\u2019m not happy and it was a\nbad way of going about it.\nWhat sort of person should run \u2013 what do you\nneed to be a good DPE?\nAlthough the position doesn\u2019t sound very interesting \u2013 it\u2019s always the one that is applied for least\n\u2013 you do need to be a dynamic person. Since it\u2019s\nso new, you need to want to shape the position.\nWe have a new staff member, Andrew Keenan\nwho is Representative Coordinator. His position\nstill needs to be integrated into the whole system.\nYou need to integrate the Departmental Reps. It\u2019s\nbecome a lot more student friendly than people\nperceive it to be. It was a position where you just\ndealt with College, but we\u2019re making it so that\nyou\u2019re not shying away from meeting up with students and talking to them. But you also need a lot\nof stamina to sit through the meetings; you need to\nbe prepared to go to a lot of boring meetings. But\nyou work with wonderful people, in the Union and\nin the College.\nAlex Dahinten\nDeputy President\n(Education)\n\u201cMake sure that you\nactually care about student\nwelfare or you\u2019ll end up\nbeing bored\u201d\nRewarding and fun, if you\u2019re committed\nWith elections looming closer, Felix talks to current Sabbs about their experiences\nFriday 04 february 2011\n\u201cYou do need to be a\ndynamic person. Since it\u2019s\nso new, you need to want\nto shape the position\u201d\n*cough, turn to the Centrefold *cough. Go\non, we\u2019ll wait for you to get back\nLook at how happy he looks, he must have\njust seen the Centrefold...\nInterview by Kadhim Shubber Interview by Anna Perman\n\n"
