    "content": "z FELIX\nCammettt\nThe Cross-Country Club are to be congratulated most heartily on their very fine\nachievement in running from Lands End\nto John 0'Groats in just over 99 hrs.\nThey are now one of the ten or so teams\nwhich have completed the run, and their\ntime compares favourably with the record\nwhen it is con siU ered that Cambridge,\nthe holders, draw on a much larger student body than do our club, and that their\nrunners were older and in the main more\nexperienced than ours. Lest any critics\nshould think that getting lost on the run\nin inexcusable, it should be pointed out\nthat when it is dark, when both drivers\nand runners are very tired, and when,\non top of this there are obscure diversions\ndue to road works to be negotiated, getting lost is all too easy. We wish the Club\nthe best of luck in their next attempt on\nthe record.\nTonight is the start of Carnival Wee\"k. This is the college's effort to raise money\nfor a very good cause, the Oxford Committee for Famine Belief. It is your Carnival, and it is only by your efforts that\nit will be a success. Elsewhere in this\nissue are full details of all that is going\non during the Week, so take a rest from\nwork -and /9up port t you tr Carnival. Felix\nwishes it every success.\nDiscerning readers will have noticed\nthat there are a larger number of photographs in this issue than average. This\nis because you, our readers, did not write\nsufficient articles. It is common at this\ncritical at a gie in the academic [year t for some students to be so awed by the fact\nthat exams, are only ' 'n'' weeks away\n(where \" n\" is a# small and rapidly decreasing number) that they go into hibernation and only reappear, pale and\nwan, on the Awful Day {itself, with a' consequent dearth of Felix contributions.\nWe hope that you will postpone hibernation for a few weeks yet, and give us more\nmaterial.\nSillerari\\\nIt seems appropriate to reprint this odd\nfragment 6f our heritage, first published\niq 1950.\nODES TO SUMMER.\nby Deby de Tees\n'Twas summer and eggs-harm pul s heats Were stacked in py all s on ^\n>\nhe flu re Full for tine labb ry ports and todo\nAnd hyde a rsf fur e and ff ure.

Porter and J.D/ Nunnington\nTake a good look at the photograph.\nNow take another look, and I am sure\nyou will agree that, at last, we have a perfect choice for Carnival Queen. In H few lines it is impossible to do full justice\nto this young lady's merits, but here, for\nyour perusal are a few i acts. Carole is a first' year physicist with all\nthe qualifications needed to fill the demanding role of a succesful and attractive\nCarnival Queen. During the short time\nshe has been at I.C. her charm has won\nher many friends, and she has become\nquite widely known among those who participate in Union affairs.\nBesides her obvious beauty and the sheen\nof her crowning glory, Carole is end owned with ,a sparkling personality, a delightful sense of humour, a modest and\nhappy disposition and boundless vitality.\nAfter almost a year in what is essentially a male college she has lost none of her charm.\nIndeed, she has a way of achieving things\nwhich is not at all forceful, but equally\nas efficient and typically feminine. The\neloquence she displays when under duress,\naided by subtle use of her eyelashes,\nwould sway the most hardened.\nIn adit ion to her social life, Carole\ndevotes much of her time and support to\nI.C. sport. She regularly plays hockey for\nI.C. and last term was also placed in aU.L. team. Her tennis has positions mB.C. S'. women's and mixed teams. Added\nto this she is at the top of the ICWA\ntable tennis ladder, plays badminton and\non occasions has even been seen wielding\na cue in the snooker room.\nHer versatility does not end there. As\nan example of the \"stunts to which she\ngraciously subjects herself, our- photograph shows Carole riding a cow at the\nbase of the Albert Memorial.\nThere is surely no reasonable doubt os\nto her suitability for Carnival Queen. If\nyou wish to prove the veracity of this\nallegation, I humbly suggest you place\nyour vote with Carole IJedingfield and\nyour confidence will be well rewarded.\nTERRY CLARKE\nCarnival\nQueen's in Review\nNo, Felix is not trying to rival Spick\nand Span in a rather prim way (what,\nno Telephone Studies! No Towel Poses I); these are the ICWArians from which the\nCarnival Queen will be chosen at this\nevening's May Ball.\nThe Queen will be decided by a pane r of characters prior to the Ball and their\ndecision will be announced at the Ball.\nBEVERLY BRADFORD\nCAROLINE\nJOYCE FOWLER MM GREGORY ROSEMARY KERFOOT\n\u00a3et le> ta ta the Edita*\nSir,\nWhile I do not usually agree with the\nuse of your columns for' inter-depart-mental abuse, I feel one epistle in your\nlast issue (17th March) from a Mr. or\nMrs Mingo requires some comment.\nPrevious to the present session, the\npopulation of the Union Snack Bar at\ncoffee and tea times was at least forty\npercent 'Biologists'. However, since the\nerection of the inverted packing case opposite the Union, the place has be cd me subject to invasions of Physicists\nlargely juveniles like your previous correspondent \u2014 many of whom are quiet,\nclean and respectable.\nSome however, are infested,- with an\nunreasonable irritability for the normal\nconversation of those whose domain they\nnow share \u2014 even to the extent of wishing to evict the inoffensive zoologists from\nthe Union and to replace their lively conversation by mumbling abusive remarks\nabout 'Coulombs' \u2014 which is a favourite\nsubject of theirs.\nWhile wishing to correct the illusion\nthat mosquitos are inactive in warm\nplaces in the early Spring, I should suggest that the best line of action is the\none already taken.\nIt is a shame to contaminate good dis-infect ant, however, so I suggest the use\nof 'Parazone' or 'Harpic' next time (but\nnot both together, since the chlorine gas\nevolved might prove fatal to the other\ninhabitants of your previous correspond-ent's lair, web or roost).\nYours sincerely, Bill Elliot\nZoology II\n\n"

As usual we left London\nby the Edgware Road and set off North,\nvia Aylesbury, stopping halfway for coffee and arriving at the meeting at 12.00\na.m. in\" time for the first race. After the\nfirst race we parked Jezebel in the pad-t dock car park in company with two other\nvintage fire engines owned by Dennis\nbrothers. By now it had started to rain\nand the vintage race cars continued\nround the track in a cloud of spray. The\nmain event of the afternoon was the Italia\nTrophy race featuring, among other vintage cars, a190? Fiat of 21 litre capacity\nrated at 260 b.h.p. This car proved difficult to hold on the track in the rain\nand took to the grass on one of the cor-ner s. Despite the formidable opposition\nthe race was eventually won by a1928 Bugatti. At 5.00 p.m. we set off on\nJezebel to have a sumptuous dinner at\na vicarage near Wickeh. Leaving (there\nat 7.30 p.m. we set off home down the\nA5 stopping for another 10 gallons of petrol and refreshment for the party at a pub nearby...\nReturning down the Edgware Road,\nwe negotiated the back streets of London\nand ariv ed at the Union at 11.40 p.m. with Jezebel somewhat bedraggled after\nher 130 mile trip.\nTHIS' YEAR'S EXPEDITIONS\nMalta Archaeological Group.\nMalta has always been the centre of\ntraffic in the Mediterranean Sea.

Group.\nTim's ij nc ident occured |on t theY. H. Group Easter vac tour of Northumberland. It is. sincerely hoped that the above\nmentioned young lady is returned safely\nto Regents Park as she was last seen\ncatching the Carlisle train with a prominent of I.C.Y. H. Group.\nRambler.\nThe tone of the tour was set even before the coach had left London, when a member of the side brought a fried break-,\nfast from Mooney's onto the coach and\nfinished it somewhere between Church\nStreet Kensington and Olympia. After\nnearly a day on the coach it was a relief\nto relax in the Penzance clubhouse and\nchat with the members of the Pirates\nClub. As one I.C. man summed it up,\n\"Contact was established with the natives,\nappeared to be friendly in exchange for\na few beads.',\nNo-ome looked (forward to the match\nagainst St. Ives the following day with\nany great optimism in view of the strange\nconditions, hostile crowd, stiffness from\nthe journey and a weakened XV. These\nviews could not have been more misleading because I.C. won 27-0. The newspaper reports the following day gave glowing accounts of the victory, among which\none said, \"A fast and very fit College\nside who played attractive open rugby.''\nThe forwards excelled themselves against\nheavy opponents and every three-quarter\nscored. After poor entertainment in the\nSt. Ives clubhouse after the match, the\nparty returned to Penzance, but not before putting to death by trampling the\nfirst ogg i of the tour.\nBy this time the Bontypool touring\nteam which included a number of Welsh\ninternationals and trialist s had arrived in\nthe same hotel. At the local hop that\nevening there was a great deal of competition between I.C. and Pontypool for\nthe local talent. One I.C. man, quoted\nabove, relented in the face of strong opposition from \"Mr. Wales 1958\".\nSunday began as a day of rest. Most of\nthe party spent the day at Lands End.\nLiberman, always the exhibition a list, found\nhis way to a perilous position above a150 ft. drop into the sea, and remained\nthere struggling until he responded to reassuring words from nearby friends and\nclimbed to safety. The one experienced\nclimber of the party,Ekman, went climbing\nwith the local T.A. and was away for four\nhours. He |ur ned up at the coach i ust as \\\nour party was setting out to see if- he had \u2022\nbeen washed up by the tide. The evening\nbecame noisier and eventually turned into a riot. Small skirmishes developed on\nthe landing and bodies slumped ,to the\nbottom of the stairs, until the Pontypool ,\nmen, who were trying to sleep, came out j and threatened to take issue with us. '\nThe rot had set in. In spite of a sober\nday and a quiet km r rie y to Cambourne\nlate on Monday afternoon,\" in which potato guns were used to shoot down wav side travellers, signs of t tiredness showed up\nin the side which played Cambourne in\nthe evening. The team made many mistakes in an attempt to live up to the refutation gained in the St. Ives game,\nalways trying to play open football. But\nagainst a strong defence and without fullback Edwards in the seco no Pha if, I.C. lost 9 - 0. The entertainment after the\nmatch was again poor, but the spirit of\nthe party was now such that no external\nencouragement was necessary.\nTuesday was a day of recuperation in\npreparation for the main match of the k toUr against Penzance Pirates, Cornish'\nchampions. After n comparatively early\nnight the team had a light training session on the Pirates ground on Wednesday\nmorning to get used to the conditions.\nWith a blustery wind sweeping the pitch\nit was clear that both sides wo ul \u00a3 be liable\nto make mistakes and the side which took\nadvantage of these would pro o ably win.\nThe I.C. tactics therefore were to follow\nup absolutely everything. The first half\nwas played at a tremendous pace. The\nI.C. side were faster in the loose and the\nopposing backs were so crowded that\nJohnson was able to intercept a hurried\npass and score between the posts. The\nscore at half time was 8 - 5 to Penzance.\nIn the second half, however, the\nexperienced home side exploited our\ntiredness with skilful short kicks supported by good following up. Back on our\nheels and with two injured men in the\nbacks, I.C. were reduced to chasing the\nfast Penzance men, the final score being\n36-5. One shrewd home spectator put his\nfinger on possibly one weakness when he\nshouted, \"Knock the beer out of 'em,\nboys!\"\nThe last evening of the tour was by tradition the wildest. Milward, met i one d and\nquoted above, killed another ogg i outside\nthe clubhouse, and Johnson and Connor\n\\ had their names taken in the town for\nstealing signs. Thus the tour ended with\nonly one repercussion when the other day\na man from Chelsea O.I.D. approached\nGordon Margretts in connection with disappearance of a Penzance coat - of - arms\nduring our stay. Nothing seems to be\nknown about it.\niN. B. Greaves\nY HA Group's Canoeing Trip\nDuring the Easter vacation, ten canoeists from the Y. H.A. Group made a cruise\ndown the River Blackwater in Southern\nEire. A rough trip down a shallow tributary brought us on to the main river,\nwhich in its upper reaches contained numerous easy rapids. The continuous rain and\noccasional hazards such as iron stakes\nprojecting out of the river bed did not\nimprove conditions. However, and, in re-tro spec t, we decided it was not advisable\nto go down even an easy rapid broadside-on. The step under Mallow bridge, described in our river guide as un shoot able was in fact shot by two of our canoes.\nFrom Mallow to Fermoy the river wound\nthrough some magnificent scenery, limestone cliffs towering above the water.\nAfter a difficult portage at a steep weir,\nwe camped at Fermoy where rain for the\nnext two days and the drabness of the\nbeer shops brought the trip to a premature\nend... \"water, water everywhere, and only\nGuinness to drink.\" We arrive^, back in\nWaleB at 3 a.m., ready to start hitch-hiking, home.\nAnyone interested in a canoe-camp mg cruise in Luxemburg next September will\nfind further de ails on the Y. H.A. noticeboard outside the concert hall.\nSOCCER CLUB\nAGM\n;The 1960-61 season was one of the most\nsuccessful in the club's history. The 1st XI, after winning the U.L. Cup, narrowly missed taking the le augue champion-ship. The U.L. Six-a side Cup was also won\nby I.C., while the 2nd XI took the U.L. Reserve Cup.\nAt the end of last term the Club's A.G.M. was held, and nearly sixty members attended. Next seasons officials were\nelected ; they are:\nDennis Harburn \u2014 Captain,\nDave Hunt \u2014 Vice-captain\nWillie Gough \u2014 Secretary,\nJohn Eoth \u2014 Fixture secretary\nBill Eiddell \u2014 Treasurer,\nMike Kev \u2014 Social secretary.\nNew full-colours were awarded to Hugh\nPayne, Dennis Harburn and Pierre\nMousset - Jones, and new half - colours to\nDave Hunt, Eddie Olding, Mike Cox and\nDave Loftus.\nClub members are reminded today is\nthe last day for ordering team photo-graphs. On Wednesday May 10th a trip\nto Wembley for t fee England v. Mexico\nmatch has been organised.\nPublished by FELIX BOABD Imperial College, London, 8.W.7., JUstes & offset printing by WEST LONDON OFFSET.CO., 86, Lillie Roafl, London, 8.W.6. Teli: FUL 7969\n\n"

GROSS CLUB'S FINE ACHIEVEMENT\nLand's End to John O' Groats Relay in99 hours 14 minutes\nThis relay follows any route between\nLands End and John (VGFroats that does\nnot involve the use of a ferry. The 1.0.\nattempt was organised in much the same\nway as the one last year by the University Cross Country Club which was un-successful. The eight runners were divided into four teams of two, each team\nbeing in a seperate vehicle. Every team\nhad to run twenty miles in stage\nlengths chosen to suit the individuals con-cern ed, then eat, drive on sixty miles to\ntheir next take-over point, and sleep\nthere for the rest of the eight-hour cycle\nuntil it was time to run again. Initially the intention was to keep to a tea\nm.p.h. schedule, which would have\nallowed us to just break the record of\n87 hr. 26 m. held by Cambridge University.\nThe vehicles left Garden Hall in the\nearly afternoon of Tuesday April 4th for\nBodmin, where camp was made for the\nnight in torrential rain. On the way there\nKeith Wall's Dormobile had an argument\nwith a bank of earth near Bodmin, losing\nits near side door in the process.\nThe vehicles moved up to their respective first take-over points next morning,\nand John Cleator started to run from\nLand's End Hotel at 11.00 a.m. The\nweather became fine for the start and remained so for some time. With a helpful\nfollowing wind we kept well ahead of\nschedule across the hills of Cornwall and\nDevon, but, at midnight, Ted Wilkins\nand George Turner got lost in the minor\nroads between Credition and Tiverton,\nresulting in a loss of thirty minutes.\nAs Bristol was approached, on Thursday morning, Chris James developed\nsickness and a bad leg, so Dave Colvin,\none of the two reserves allowed, relieved\n-him. While he was being brought up to\ndo this John Collins had to run a ten-and-a half mile leg, and James had to\nstagger along1 for five miles. Continued\nrain which lasted for sixteen hours, had\nset in at this stage.\nWith 240 miles done, Jbeypnd Gloucester, other injuries became apparent.\nBoth Cleator and Jeff Greenleaf had\nstrained knees, and they had to be assisted by Dick Burt, who volunteered to\nact as reserve at the last moment in place\nof Alan Hookert who had hurt his foot in\nan accident while travelling down to\nLandB End. Ted Willkins and Pete\nWarron were having foot trouble, but\nGeorge Turner, Dave Hammond and John\nCollins were running well and continued\nto do so.\nAt Warrington Dave Gilbert joined us to\nact as a driver. There we were treated,\nto the sight of him standing in the road\n(holding the door of a Dormobile being\ndriven away by Jim Bernard I String was\nused to tie it on again.\nIIHHHI\nCOLLINS AT THE FINISH\n.On Friday morning Collins and Colvin\nran up Shaj> Etelt (IfiQO ft\u00bb.)) and the\nScotish Border was reached that after-noon, four hours behind schedule. A new\ncasualty was Roger Etedge, one ^f the\ndrivers, who had to pay a short visit to\nhospital, suffering from extreme exhaust-ion. We had then done 560 miles, and\nwere well over half way, and the weather\nwas much improved.\nTh\u00a9 hilly countryside was tackled relatively easily, Collins an cf Colvin having\nthe worst climb \u2014 Beattock. Unfortunately, very early on Saturday morning, in\nfreezing conditions, James and Wilkins\ngot badly lost in a new road system near\nLanark, resulting in a loss of two-and-a half hours, and putting us 7^ hours behind schedule.\nOn Saturday rn or ning Hammonds, Burt\nand Greenleaf very successfully tackled\nan extremely hilly 40 mile detour in the\nLoch Tay area, which saved 11 miles,\nbut involved one climb to 1,700 ft., and\nseveral others to 1,100 ft. from 500 ft.\nAfter this Collins and Colvin climbed\"\nthe 1,500 ft. Drumochter Pass, and we\nhad then gone further than U.L. C.C.C. did last year.\nThe last mountainous 299 miles were\ncompleted on Saturday afternoon and\nnight, and Sunday morning in bitter iv cold weather with pouring rain and gale\nforce winds. In spite of this all nine runners did well, and when the stage lengths\nwere reduced for an 80 mile long \"sprint\"\nto finish, the scheduled speed was again\nmaintained. Collins, after running 110\nmiles, did one of. his last miles in five\nnr nute s, and he frequently^ exceeded 15\nm.p.h. downhill. We re'ached John\nO 'Groats Hotel at 2.14 p.m. on Sunday,\n99 hr. 14m. after starting, an<l everyone\nwas still running strongly.\nMuch credit for this achievement is due\nto the crew,of the fifth vehicle who cooked\na meal for five people, in all conditions,\nevery twenty miles, and who had prat ic ally no rest.\nTeams, with distances run, were:\nA. John Cleator (68) and Jeff Greenleaf\n(100)\nDave Fearn and Jim Bernard: hired\nBedford Dormobile.\nB.

If it is surprising that the\nDramatic Sooiety should undertake this1 difficult enterprise, it is astonishing, in\nthe most pleasurable way, that they\nshould come up with a performance which\nwould do credit to many a professional\nOf course, there were weaknesses. Perhaps a couple of the parts were too much\n\u2022for the j actors j, perhaps the last i\\s j cene change was too long, but still the rih al curtain left one a little breathless, overcome by the profundity of it all. This\nmust have been what the authors in-tended, and this was how it was.\nMuch of the credit must go to the pro-duce r, Dick Saunders, who welded together a largely inexperienced cast and\nsqueezed from it ca ie of the outstanding\nDramatic Society productions of recent\nyears.\nThe main character, Michael Ransom,\nstriving to conquer the forbidden mount-ain, gave Ross Butler the best part of his\nCAST.

Mrs. A. An Announcer\nCollege acting career. Ransom is a leader,\na man to look up to and respect. Ross\n\u2022Sutler gave him the leader's outward con-fide n ce, out still carefully portrayed the\ngrowing inner doubts which Ransom\nhad in himself and his ambitions. Never\ndid he fall into the trap of being over-. dr afm at id,i impress ij v ely using the varied\ndialogue to display his main asset, which\nis a fine, rich, stage voice.\nTwo performances stood out like rare\ngems. These came from Judith Jbewits, us\nthe syrup v, steeped in establishment tradition Lady Isobel Welwyn, and from\nGillian Tilden-Smith, who, in the part of\nMrs. A., sympathetically portrayed the\neternal tedium and-drudgery, which is the\nlot of the average housewife.\nOne could not help feeling sorry for\nRoger Haddon and Jennifer Ellison, who\nhad the most difficult supporting roles.\nThe former tried to bring out the disintegration of the young climber, desperately\nwanting to be chosen for the final assault\non the summit, but knowing he could not\nface it if it should come. The tense, nerve\nracking torture of waiting did not quite\ncome through,\nJennifer Ellison, as Ransom's mother,\nwas faced with an um enviable task. At\ntHe best of times, it is difficult for a young woman to act a middle aged one,\nbut when the part is as obscure as this,\nit becomes nearly impossible. Miss Ellison did not grasp the 'significance of her\npart (in common with most of the aud-ien ce) and consequently, she never quite\nmade up her mind how to interpret it.\nNeither she nor Roger Haddon need\nbe discouraged. They will surely in future\nreceive parts more amenable to their tal-ents.\nAlas, there is no space to mention alt\nthe others. SuTtice w say that each played\nhis part to his utmost ability and, a high\ndegree of ability wag apparent.\nBut mention must be made of the men\nbehind the stage. In all recent product-ions, even when the performers have been,\nbelow par, the quality of the sets, both\nm design and construction, has reached,\nthe highest standards. This play required\nseveral sets, and Hagen Jurke, Chris\nNicolas, Tony Shipley and their colle gue s met the challenge with characteristic in-ge nuit y. Particularly impressive was a blizzard scene, which was so realistic that\nit drew spontaneous applause \u2014 or was\nthe clapping an attempt by the audience\ntc keep warm?\nIt is to be hoped that in future more\npeople will think it worth-while to attend\nDramatic Society productions. For this\none, the audiences were well below cap^-a city./ But -in all justice, the Concert\nHall should iha v fe been as overflowing\nwith people as the Dramatic Society is\nwith enthusiasm.\nEddie Fersht\nCARNIVAL CONTRIBUTORS\nThe oom pani es listed below have con.\ntri bu fed to making this carnival possible.\nTo them a very special and sincere thank\nyou.\nAertex\nAllen West & Co.

The pattern of such evening**\nWas followed with the usual items, curio\nstalls, Scabasre't, buffet and a most un-Asian \"hop\".\nThe curio stalls with their carvings,\nchopsticks and novelties differed little\nfrom previous ones, the cabaret, however,\nWas varied and of a high standard. The\nMalayan candle dance which started the\nprogramme was delightful with its subtle\nintricacies, and contrasted with the\nsimpler and equally entertaining Indonesian candle-dance later in the pro-gram me. Of the two Chinese dances\ngiven, the dexterity of the performers\nwas obvious in the sword dance, while\nI.C.'s small stage j hampered the shawl\ndances whose shawls looked a bit tired\nafter their round of College International\nevenings. The vocal part of the cabaret\nstarted off with a group of Malayan songs\nin which the audience even joined. Two\nsongs were given, the first dolefully telling\nof a broken hearted lover, while the other,\nthough supposedly in a lighter vein, differed in style and presentation. A group\nof three songs by a Chinese tenor was\nwell presented, and the third in English,\nfor our benefit was especially well re-ce i ved. One of the highlights of the evening's entertainment was a performance by a Japanese guitarist, a former pupil of\nSegovia and apparently a star in his own\nright. With a seemingly effortless rippling of the fingers, he presented the intricate scoring of two items of Spanish\nguitar music showing what the instrument was capable of in the hands of a more than competent player. The other,\nand to me, the better, of the two highlights was a set of two Indian dances\npresented by a young and beautiful Indian\ngirl. The first was a temple dance to the\nLord Krishna, which, were informed, was\nonly recently secular is ed for us mortals\nto see. Even to the uninitiated and that\nmust have included nearly all of us pre-sent, the grace and fluidity of motion\nwas breath-taking \u2014 from the delicate\nshaping of the fingers, to the beautifully\nsinuous motion of the arms., The second\ndance, in praise of Spring, was as technically brilliant as the first, while the\nUnquestioned imagery e vol led could have\nimpressed even t*he dullest brown-b agger. Stage lighting was good throughout most\nof the cabaret, but non-existent in the\nlast number where it could been used to\ngreat advantage. A note of appreciation\nto the M.C.'s, the Silver to un gue d Ashfag Qureshi and the more down to earth\nand equally a mus if ng Wing Kong.\nA novel attraction was the sale of Japanese rice wine, sake, and Chinese millet\nwine, Kao Liang. The sake was enjoyable,\nthough the rougher and more potent\nChinese wine hit our throats with a bang.\nIn the line of solid refreshment, the hut-Mt was tasty,, small, (and choice fc on existant.\nIMBIBAGE FOR WOMEN AT LAST!\nAt last the sorties of the dreaded Misses\nBradford into one of the last wholly male\npreserves of 1.0. have had their effect.\nCertain members of Weeks Hall unable to\nresist the pitiful cries of the dy pso maniacs in ICWA for alcohol, have decided to supply the long awaited opportunity, for\nmixed drinking in I.
