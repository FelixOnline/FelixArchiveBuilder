I have been reading it weekly since I started\nCollege and would be disappointed to see it go.\nYour editorial said that the column will be scrapped due\nto 'popular demand'. I take this to mean that you don't think that very many people read it, and that you have\nsomething better with which to replace it. I think that you\nare underestimating the number of people who read The\nBaron. It's readership is certainly not limited to those\npeople who appear in it. I know a lot of people who have\nnever appeared in The Baron, but who read it regularly,\nboth for humour and information. I think that if you were\nto compare the number of people who read The Baron\nwith those who read other regulars, such as the sports\npage, racing column or music reviews, you would find\nthat The Baron is far more popular. If you have to cut\nanything, maybe it should be one of those rather that The\nBaron.\nI think that The Baron is an excellent parody of college\nand student life, and scrapping it would be a major loss\nboth to FELIX and to its many faithful readers.\nYours sincerely,\nGavin Spittlehouse (DOC 2).\nThanks for the letter, Gavin, but the Baron has been\ndropped for now, due to pressure of exams, etc., etc.\nHe's still in cold storage, though, so don't be surprised\nif he pops up once more this year!\nUGMS: the\nchips are down\nDear Judith,\nWith regard to your editorial (FELIX March 23), I would like to make the following points concerning\nUGMs.\nFirstly, although UGMs have appeared quo rate this\nyear, this has seldom been the case. They merely seem\nto be because there are usually at least 300 people in the\nJCR at lunchtimes anyway. The fact is, at UGMs this year,\nmost of the students deemed 'present' are just eating their\nlunch and couldn't give a toss if there is a meeting going\non or not. When abstentions and votes cast are counted,\nthey rarely total 150, let alone 300.\nSecondly, regarding the location of UGMs: The JCR\nobviously won't do, nor would any other place where the\nquorum can be fiddled in the way I have described. UGMs\nwere traditionally held in the Great Hall. Was this to cope\nwith the vast numbers of students desperately trying to\nfight their way in, to get a seat so that they could pay close\nattention to what was going on? Somehow I doubt it.\nThis leaves a dilemma: If UGMs are held in the JCR,\nthey are quo rate until everyone has finished eating their\nlunch and get up to leave. If they are held somewhere far ty like the Great Hall, no one bothers turning up anyway.\nOne solution is to lower quorum. It seems to me,\nhowever, that it is low enough already and dropping it\nfurther would make UGMs even more unrepresentative.\nIs it not an indictment of how boring student politics has\nbecome if a college of 5000+ students cannot muster 300\nfor a meeting once a month?\nThe ideal, of course, is to make UGMs interesting. If\nJoe Student attends a lively and, dare I say it, fun U GM, he may well go to the next one, possibly with a mate or\ntwo. It appears to me that people are turned off for a variety of reasons: Union Officers giving lengthy, boring\nreports; Sabbaticals attempting to sabotage meetings; faulty\nPA system; arguing political factions; constant challenges\nto the Chairman's ruling; speakers ranting on for hours;\netc, etc...\nI don't know the answers, but I do have a few questions:\nAre UGMs properly advertised?\nWhy do the Union hierarchy appear un bothered by the\napathy that exists at ICU?\nWhy are students so apathetic to their Union anyway?\nUGMs are the only forum for students to hear the people\nthey voted in explaining what they do with their time,\ndespite the idea put forward by one sabbatical recently\nto abolish them altogether.\nOne of the reasons I stood for the post of next year's UGM Chairman was to try and break down the barrier\nbetween students and 'those people sitting up there at the\nfront' at UGMs. However, given the level of disinterest\nat IC, could anyone really care less?\nCheers,\nPaul Shanley.\nEndurante?\nDear Judith,\nStudent life at some Italian universities is reputed to\ncontain features that might make the Imperial student raise\nan eyebrow. We refer to the well established Goliardia\ntradition that many student there undergo.\nGoliardia derived from the Latin 'Golia' meaning\nexcellence at everything, was a term used to refer to\nstudents. The traditional view held by many at the time\nthe term was coined was that a student should be\noutstanding at studies, be physically robust, and be aware\nof contemporary Italian culture. Being a student at\nuniversity was considered to be adequate proof of the\nformer. Italian students devised many light-hearted tests\nto determine the other qualities mentioned. Passing any\none of the various tests of character earned the students\nthe accolade of Goliardia (member of the Goliardia).\n1) The arena.\nIn this event all the competing candidates are made to enter\na ringed enclosure in nothing but their underclothes and\non all fours. The only form of motion allowed is crawling.\nThe contestants are eliminated when they have their\nposterior bitten. The contestant managing to avoid\nsuffering this humiliation emerges victor.\n2) The juke box.\nIn this event the contestant is placed in a man size cupboard\nwith a slit in it. Other students put money through the slit\nand request a song to be sung. Failure to satisfy the\naudiences' high expectations of the singers result in the\njuke box being shaken violently.\nWe urge students at Imperial to borrow a leaf from our\nItalian counterparts. In particular we urge Fiona Nicholas\nto introduce the Goliardia tradition as a part of the Rag\ntradition. There will be no dearth of ideas about what\nstudents here could be made to do to earn the accolade\nof Goliardia.\nYours sincerely,\nLuca Zullo,\nYishu Nanda,\nChem Eng PGs\nFELIX Friday 29th April 1988 23\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFELIX-800 NOT OUT\n3df ft lK \"PACKS PUNCH\nFELIX, the student newspaper of Imperial College, was born eight hundred\nissues ago today. Since its humble geste tn ered beginnings, it has seen fifty-six\neditors steer its course from the kitten, wide-eyed and blinking, to the cynical,\ninquisitive full-grown cat of the nineteen eighties.\nThe first issue of FELIX was sold for\nthree old pence on 9th December\n1949. Only six hundred copies were\nproduced as the new editorial team\nwere unsure as to how a newspaper\nwould go down at IC. It was typed,\ngeste tn ered by the College books tall, and then sold around departments and\nfrom the Union Bar. The Editor, Ted\nHughes, set the tone of the newspaper\nin his editorial, which he suitably\nplaced first in the sheets. The aim of\nFELIX was to provide a 'commentary\nupon events and personalities' as a complementary source of information\nto The Phoenix, the Union's arts and\nliterary paper which was originally\nstarted by HG Wells.\nThis first FELIX was much thinner\nand events orientated than today's are\nand it contained just one news story,\nabout raucous behaviour at a Guy\nFawkes night party. Out of its twelve\npages, three were devoted to the boat\nclub. The others contained\nConstituent College Union reports, an\narticle on the Brighton Rally, a sports\nreview, a diary of 'what's ons', letters\nand gossip.\nThe editorial board was delighted\nby the response to the newspaper. All\nsix hundred copies had been sold\nbefore 10am and some students had\nbeen re-selling their copies for as\nmuch as four pence to latecomers. It\nwas decided that they would move the\nprint run up to one thousand copies\nto cope with the demand. They also\nagreed that FELIX would come out\nfortnightly during undergraduate term\ntime.

It was only four pages and\nthe type was reduced, enabling just\nas much text to be fitted in those four\nNo 111 25th October 1957\npages as was fitted before on twelve.\nThis was the first time that FELIX\nwas printed, giving the editorial board\nthe ability to reproduce photographs\nas well as line drawings.\nIn the spring of '51 John Midgley\nsucceeded Clifford Hargreaves as\nEditor. By then the paper was settling\ndown into the format it was to have\nthroughout the fifties: sports at the\nback, news on the front, letters and\neditorial to the front and a series of\nopinion articles under the title of\n'Viewpoint'.

    "content": "FELIX\nRag Fete\nIt's Rag Fete tomorrow and as an avid\nEastenders' fan I can't wait to meet\nDonna and Elizabeth (I wonder why\nthey couldn't get one of the hunk y men as well!). FELIX is going to have\na stall there where we will be flogging\noff our t shirts and sweatshirts and a photographer will be going around\ntaking pictures of you all which you\ncan buy for Rag next Monday.\nThe best bit will be the Exam Blues\nBall that evening. It's going to be my\nlast chance to let my hair down before\nall my staff desert me to revise.\nCollege Finance\nI spent yesterday ploughing through\nthe report on the organisation and\nmanagement of the College Finance\nOffice. I'm afraid I was not at all\nsurprised by the conclusions that were\nreached. We all knew when the new\ncomputing system was installed that\nit had been badly thought out and the\naccounting package unsuitable. No\ndoubt a few administrators will be\ngiven the push, if only sideways, to\nstop them from doing any more harm.\nThe worse thing to come out of this\nwhole fiasco is the bad feeling that has\nbuilt up between College and its\nsuppliers, some of whom have not\nbeen paid for over six months.\nCollege currently owes the Print Unit\nin excess of \u00a36000 for work it has\ndone over the last year, so I hate to\nthink how much the total debt is to\noutside suppliers.\nIt will take a long time for all of us\nto regain faith in the Finance Section.\nUnion Finance\nIt appears that the Snack Bar and the\nUnion Bar have lost money, and been\nlosing it for a long time. The Union\nOffice are tight-lipped on the subject\nbut concerned enough to call in the\npolice. I agree that it is worrying that\nso much money should have gone\nastray (rumoured to be between\n\u00a35,000 and \u00a310,000, although nobody\nwill confirm a figure with me) but\nthey seem to have little regard for\ntheir snack bar and bar staff. One of\nmy friends who worked casually in\nthe Snack Bar one night a week last\nterm was told that she had to see the\npolice and was given no reason why.\nAfter several re-scheduled\nappointments, she was told that they\nno longer wanted to interview her.\nAgain she was given no reason.\nPerhaps you think that such a loss\ndeserves the utmost secrecy but\nthey've thrown suspicion on all the\noude t staff and made them all feel like\nthey've done something wrong.\nI do hope that they find out where\nthis money has gone because such a loss affects us all as Union members\nand outlet users\u2014which takes me onto\na second point.\nThe portions are\ngetting smaller!\nThe Union Office have told the Snack\nBar that a portion is a spoonful of\nsalad. This is clearly outrageous\nbecause last term I got two spoon fulls. This is an effective 100% increase in\nthe prices. I'm now still hungry after\nvisiting the Snack Bar and I'm revolting (no jokes please). I no\nlonger believe the Snack Bar to be\n'good value' as it once used to be. The\ntrouble with the Union is that it's been\ntaken over by managers who are not\nconcerned with students but with\nmaking a profit. They should be\nencouraging students to use the outlets\nnot forcing them away because of\nirregular opening hours, minute\nportions and bad value for money.\nI'm now taking my custom to\nWaitrose.\nKebabs\nI was very impressed by the quality\nof the kebabs they now serve in\nSouthside. In fact I have been\ncontinually impressed by the rise in\nstandards of the various College food\noutlets since Rob Northey took over\nas Refectories Manager. Again I'm concerned about the prices.\nNow for the rant...\nA few years ago there was a tendency\namongst Union Officers to want to\ntake over failing College outlets\nbecause they thought they could run\nthem better, rather than pushing\nCollege for a better deal. I know\nbecause I was part of that movement.\nMy Union heyday was picketing the\nCollege Bars because we wanted the\nUnion Bar. I think, on reflection, that\nwe were wrong.\nWe now concern ourselves with our\nbar and snack bar. We no longer have\nthe power to persuade College to\nlower their prices because we're\ntrying to make the profit as well. The\nUnion has employed two new\nmembers of permanent staff to cope\nwith these outlets. It no longer has\ntime to concern itself with the simple\nthings like campaigning for lock\nchanges in Southside, realistic prices\nin the Southside Shop, a better\nCollege careers service, lecturing\nstandard, etc.\nThe Union is becoming curiously\nmore and more insular rather than\nopening itself up. Today's Union is\na union of secrets and publicity stunts.\nI don't think that the Union has done\nanything of real significance for the\naverage student for years. I invite\nletters on the subject, especially from\nUnion Officers.

It was decided that\nFELIX should start accepting\nadvertisements from local traders and\nbanks eager to attract student custom.\nThe revenue wasn'ta great deal but\nit enabled the price to stay at three\npence until 1957.\nIt was at this time that the new\nUnion Building was completed and a FELIX Office was placed on its third\nfloor. A member of the Editorial\nBoard inhabited this office between\nl pm and 2pm every weekday in order\nto receive news and articles. This\nroom was also used by the production\nteam to paste the paper up every other\nTWO GIRLS\nNEEDED\nFROM EACH DEPARTMENT\ni TO STAND IN THE RAIN,\n1 WIND AND SNOW (OR\nHALF AN HOUR EVERY\nI FORTNIGHT\n' SElllM\nFELIX\nDon't ill ruth ft \u00bbnt*\ndrop a it u ts fata rU\nThe Ualac lack w CM* \u00bb tact a ate mb tr tl Bit Filix Stall.\nSunday. The FELIX staff seemed\nquite happy with their new room\nbecause it overlooked Queen\nAlexandra House, whose inhabitants\nwere notorious for leaving their\ncurtains open when undressing!\nThe FELIX news pages were\ndominated by stories of the proposed\ndemolition of the Imperial Institute to\nallow a new, sprawling 'island'\ncomplex to be built. The College also\nannounced its plans to develop the\nPrinces Gardens site for new Halls of\nResidence and a sports centre.\nFELIX was still being published\nfortnightly by very primitive printing\nmethods by 1959. It was at this time\nof massive College expansion plans\nthat the Union, staff and students\nbegan to express doubts about the way\nFELIX was produced. Several other\nLondon colleges had started up their\nown newspapers which were heavily\nsub sidi sed by their unions and of a much higher quality than that of\nFELIX. It still cost 3d but was only\nmaking a profit of \u00a3 2 each year. It\nwas at this time that the FELIX staff\nfaced the decision of whether to\nincrease the price and the quality of\nthe publication. There were also calls\nthat FELIX should go weekly. These\nwere rejected for two reasons: it was\nnot possible for a student to get a degree and produce a newspaper each\nweek, and they felt that College\nwasn't generating enough 'hot' news\nto fill a newspaper each week.\nFELIX entered the Sixties guarded\nand cautious about its future. The staff\nrealised that if FELIX was to compete\nwith the College's broadsheets it\nwould have to be printed on better\nquality paper, raise more advertising\nand charge 4d for each copy. There\nwas still the inconvenience of having\nto send the artwork up to Lancashire\nfor printing which wasted two days\nand made sure that most news was out\nof date by the time FELIX was\npublished. Successive editors brought\nout news supplements in geste tn ered form which were inserted into each\ncopy before distribution to try to keep\nthe paper 'fresh'. Throughout the\ndecade they were hampered by\nunreliable printers who could not\nmeet deadlines or could only print\nillegibly.\nBy 1967 new printers had been\nfound which ensured FELIX always\ncame out every other Friday. This\nnecessitated FELIX moving up to\ntabloid size from its usual A4 format.\nFELICES of the late Sixties were\nfar more political than they are now.\nThey featured news of Vietnam,\nFELIX2. FELfX, DECEMBER 3rd1976 or fantasy?

Again it found\nitself being criticised as a waste of\nmoney and trees. Some important\ndecisions had to be taken by the\nEditorial Board and the Union about\nWhy FELIX?\nEverybody's heard of FELIX the cat. So why was the newspaper called after\nthis American cartoon character? The truth of the matter is that nobody is really\naltogether sure why Ted Hughes, the first editor, decided on the name. FELIX\nwas actually suggested by FC Ewells which is well-reported in the first issue\nbut at no point does it say why everybody thought the name was an apt one.\nThe most likely theory is that it was a bastard is ed version of Phoenix, which\nwas a literary magazine produced by the Union twice a year and was the only\nUnion publication up until that point. It is easy to see why a cartoon character's name should seem to fit so well when its brother publication is the high and\nhaughty Phoenix, rising periodically from the ashes.

    "content": "jam\nWail Street (15)\nIt is unfortunate in a sense that\nMichael Douglas has received so\nmuch hype for his role in Fatal\nAttraction and little, in Britain at least,\nfor his magnificent part in Wall Street.\nWinning an Oscar is not easy,\nespecially against such talents as\nWilliam Hurt and Robin Williams,\nbut I can say for certain that Douglas\ndeserves it fully for bringing the\ncharacter Gordon Gekko truly to life.\nGekko is a corporate raider, has the\nsole occupation of obtaining what he\nwants\u2014usually money\u2014when he\nwants, and using it in any way\nnecessary to bring more capital gains.\nHis office furniture alone could testify\nto his income, and we need n't even\nlook at his art collection or beach\nhome for further proof. From his first\nappearance, right up to his final one,\nDouglas makes it clear that no one\nand nothing is more important than\nbeing wealthy and a part of that one\nper cent of American people who own\nhalf of the country's riches.\nBalance this with Charlie Sheen, a young broker who wants in on the\nfaster world of higher finance, but not\nat any price. With the totally ruthless\nGekko as teacher, however, anyone\ncan go astray, and the character of\nBud Fox, once again made believable\nby superb acting, quickly does. We\nfollow Fox's induction into the nasty\nworld of money, and we are\naccompanied by Carl Fox watching\nalso, and forced to bear witness to the\nfast rise and inevitable fall of his son.\nThe scenes with Charlie Sheen\nopposite his father Martin are a delight to see and add further realism\nto this movie.\nYou have to be good to get to the\ntop, and Bud Fox is. To stay there\ntakes something more, complete\ndisregard for everybody except\nyourself, and only Gekko has that in\nthis film. Fox is on his way out\nquickly, but if the good guys must go\ndown, they always go down fighting.\nRevenge is sweet, and Fox does get\na small taste.\nDon't be fooled, there isn'ta happy\nending. Oliver Stone (director of\nPlatoon and Midnight Express) does\nnot provide a heart-warming couple\nof hours of entertainment. Rather he\ngives us a lesson. Not that walking\nover people is bad\u2014Gekko is doing\nquite well. Nor does he say that you\ncan do well if you're willing to take\non Gekko and his rivals. Bud Fox\ndoesn't. The lesson is that to play with the\nbig boys you have to be one of them.\nIf you're not then it's only a matter\nof time before you get your fingers\nburned. The big boys live by one rule:\n'Bucks is everything,' Douglas tells\nus, 'the rest is conversation'. If you\ndon't play by the rules, you don't play.\nI couldn't help being reminded of\nThe Hitcher while watching Wall\nStreet. Rutger Hauer takes a full two\nhours to corrupt his innocent protege,\nwhile Michael Douglas does it in just\nthirty minutes. The dealing shown is\nalso reminiscent of the showdown in\nTrading Places, but Wall Street has\nno Eddie Murphy, no laughs, and no\nrunners up.\nThe most striking quality of this\nfilm is its realism, provided partly by\na wonderful cast, and aided\nimmensely by the New York\nbackdrop, ever present and always\nimpressive. The business world\nexists, and no doubt there is a Gordon\nGekko, or many, somewhere.\nMichael Douglas convinced me of\nthat. In Fatal Attraction he proved\nthat he is a star. In Wall Street he\nshows just what an enormously\ntalented star he is.\nSee this film. I can guarantee you'll\nenjoy it. Wall Street opens tonight at\nthe Odeon, Leicester Square.\nAndrew Clarke.\nThe Princess Bride (PG)\nI suspect very few people over the age\nof ten would be attracted by the\nadvertising for this film. After all, that\ntends to be the audience that fairytales are aimed at. The release during\nEaster indicates that perhaps the\ndistributors and film makers consider\nthis to be a children's film. But I would disagree.\nBased on a book by William\nGoldman, (Marathon Man, Magic),\nit tells the story of the true love\nbetween a simple farm boy, Westley,\n(Cary Elves) who is in fact as much\nof a hero as Indiana Jones, and\nButtercup (Robin Wright in her first\nfilm role). They suffer from none of\nthe problems of modern day true\nlove\u2014safe sex, mortgages and what\nto put in the children's packed\nlunches\u2014but every conceivable\nmisfortune of medieval times.\nTorture, kidnapping, a good deal of\ninnocent violence and even a giant\nrodent of which James Herbert would\nbe proud.\nThe baddies get their rightful\npunishment, the goodies get their\nvarious revenges, and in the end true\nlove wins, as we were promised all\nalong. It still sounds like a Disney\ncartoon doesn't it?\nThe adult element comes in the\nhighly satirical humour, predominant\nthroughout, and often very subtle.\n'You just made one of the two\nclassical major blunders' laughs the\nevil mercenary Vizzini, who has\nswitched poisoned drinks while the\nhero's back is turned, 'The other is\nto start a land-based war in Asia.' The\neffect is reminiscent of Time Bandits\nwith a simpler story. Nothing\ncomplicated to distract you from the\nfun.\nThe cast are good, and special\nperformances by Peter Falk, Mel\nSmith, Peter Cook and Billy Crystal\nas the wizard Miracle Max, with\nJewish accent and made-up like Yoda,\nadd a small touch of class.\nThis is a pleasant film, enjoyable\nto watch, and made j fi th tongue\nfirmly in cheek. Above all it is nice\nto see another low budget British film\nappearing to challenge the big bucks\nHollywood productions being\nincessantly thrown at us. The Princess\nBride not only fares well against\nthem, for entertainment value it beats\nmany of them hands down.\nAndrew Clarke\n18 Friday 29th April 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Wi!\"\"WM\n#1. * :\nreviews\nOOTBALL\nby\nAdrian\nGraingerThe end of the season is nigh with\npoints at this stage vital for those\nteams pushing for promotion or\npulling away from the dire disasters\nof relegation. There are two sets of\nfixtures as it is Bank Holiday\nweekend. Check press for KO times.\nSaturday 30th April\nChelsea vs Liverpool\nStamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)\nChelsea are desperate for points in\ntheir fight against the play-off\nposition, but a game against the newly\ncrowned league champions wouldn't really be their ideal choice of game.\nTwo goals late on against Cup\nfinalists (my start of season\nprediction) Wimbledon gave the\nBlues a vital point last week but they\nwon't be expecting that sort of charity\nfrom Barnes, Beardsley and Co.\nLiverpool to win. (I wish Dalglish\nwould learn to speak properly\nthough).\nCrystal Palace vs Blackburn\nSelhurst Park (Selhurst Park BR)\nThis second division tussle looks a classic with both sides looking for top\nflight football next year. Palace must\nhope that the sides above them slip up\nin order to make the play offs and a game against the side one above them\nis the best way of insuring that this\nhappens. Blackburn recruited Ossie\nArdiles and Steve Archibald to bolster\ntheir challenge and look set to at least\nshare the points.\nMillwall vs Stoke City\nThe Den (New Cross tube)\nMillwall have had a great season and\nhead the table, looking set to make\nDivision One for the first time. A win\nwould at least guarantee a play off\nplace and four more points would\nmake the dream a reality. Stoke are\na good side and Mick Mills has a team\nfor the future. They will return, but\nnot this year. Millwall to take the\npoints.\nBrentford vs Doncaster\nDivision Three game.\nLeyton Orient vs Hereford\nBrisbane Road (Leyton tube)\nThe battle for places in the Division\nFour play off places could hardly be\ncloser or harder. Orient must win\ntheir last three games to make sure of\ntheir deserved place, starting off with\na victory here.\nMonday 2nd May\nArsenal vs Coventry\nHighbury (Arsenal tube)\nThis game is of new real importance\nwith the distant position of a place in\nEurope for the Gunners being of some\nI suppose. They lost a brilliant\nLittlewoods Cup Final last week and\nthis might throw them. Coventry are\nlooking for top eight place for\npersonal pride only and might prove\ntough opposition. A draw looks\npossible if Arsenal are still under the\nweather.\nCharlton vs Tottenham\nSelhurst Park (Selhurst BR)\nCharlton looked doomed a few\nmonths ago but now have a lifeline\nto survival and they must win this to\ninject life into the battle campaign.\nCrooks netted twice more against\nNewcastle last week and has proved\na valuable asset this year. Spurs aren't out of the relegation battle either yet\nand losing games 39 and 40 could put\nthem in the play off position, so they\nmust salvage something too. A hard\nfought score-draw is what I will\npredict.\nWest Ham vs Chelsea\nUpton Park (Upton Park tube)\nThis can best be described as the\ntypical end of season 6 pointer with\nrelegation a possibility for the loser,\nwith the added spice that the teams are\nlocal rivals and enemies! West Ham\nhave thrown away their old form of\nplay and look a desperate side, full\nof good players who won't score and\nan injury list longer than the team list.\nChelsea had a bad run which put them\nin this position and a point here would\nsuit them fine. I think that the\nHammers will take the points in a scrappy but exciting game. (11.30am kick off).\nWimbledon vs Sheffield Wed\nPlough Lane (Wimbledon Pk tube)\nI congratulate the Dons on reaching\nthe FA Cup final and I am sure that\nthey will do themselves justice on the\nday. The result of this game isn't really important but I am sure that\neach side will play as good as usual.\nInjuries must be avoided for the home\nside, so they must be 'Wise'!\nWednesday are in-form and a draw\nat QPR last week kept up their\nchallenge. Wimbledon to win by the\nodd goal.\nFulham vs Bury\nThe home team\npromotion only a hope...\nto win with\nmathematical\nGames of the weekend:\nCrystal Palace vs Blackburn.\nWest Ham vs Chelsea.\nby\nAdrian\nBourne\nThe fanatical Italian Tifosi will make\nsure that Ferrari will get a rapturous\nwelcome as the Formula One circus\nreturns to Europe for the San Marino\nGrand Prix at Imola, Italy, on\nSunday.\nFerrari enter the race in their best\nshape for five years and a victory for\nlocal hero Gerhard Berger will\nelevate him to the status of a god, last\noccupied by the late, great, Canadian,\nGilles Villeneuve, whose career and\nstyle Gerhard has remarkably\nmatched.\nNiether completed the traditional\nkarting/Formula Ford/F3/F2 ladder\nthat most drivers climb but quickly\nprogressed from other areas of the\nsport. Villeneuve was World\nSnowmobile champion before moving\ninto Fl straight from the American\nFormula Atlantic.\nBerger started in Motocross, then\nAlfasud racing and a bit of European\nF3 before leapfrogging into Fl. One of Berger's first Alfasud races\nwas at Imola in 1982, a support event\nto Villeneuves's last Grand Prix.\nGilles was cheated of victory by\n'team-mate' Didier Pironi when\ncruising to an unchallenged 1-2 for\nFerrari and Gilles vowed never to\nspeak to Pironi again. This would\ntragically prove correct, as Villeneuve\nwas killed in an horrific accident\nthirteen days later at Zolder, Belgium,\non 8th May.\nBerger admits that his favourite\ndir ver of all time is Villeneuve and\ntheir styles have frequently been\ncompared. Perhaps the best\ndescription I 've heard is 'looking like\nan accident with somewhere to take\nplace, but never happening'.\nLike Villeneuve did, Berger should\nhave scored his first win on home soil\nbut his car faltered when he held a commanding lead. My only regret is\nthat he drives Ferrari no 28, whereas\nVilleneuve's old number was 27.\nBerger's greatest opposition will\nagain be the McLaren-Hondas of\nAlain Prost and Ayrton Senna and\nNigel Mansell's Williams-Judd.\nThe Dino-Ferrari circuit at Imola,\nnamed after Enzo Ferarri's fighter\npilot son, is 3.1 miles with long\nstraights, tight corners and silly\nchicanes. It is undoubtedly a horsepower circuit which should see\nthe turbos well up in qu ali fi ying but\nit is also notoriously bad for fuel\nconsumption which will hit the turbos\nin the race.\nAfter the successful predictions in\nthe last column (four winners and four\nsecond places), I 'll put my head on\nthe block again and go for Ayrton\nSenna to win, after the\ndisappointment of being disqualified\nin the last two races, and Nigel\nMansell to be leading atmospheric.\nSome of you may have seen the\nexcellent BBC coverage over the\nholiday of the British Formula Three\nand Saloon Car championships. Both\nare benefitting from the increased\nmedia attention with better sponsors\nand larger grids. Both series have\nraces this Bank Holiday Monday\n(May 2), F3 at Silverstone, Saloons\nat Thruxton.\nThe saloon car scene is currently\ndominated by the Ford Sierra RS500;\nAndy Rouse, Jerry Mahoney and\nGraham Goode the likely victors.\nClass B will be dominated by the\nBMW M3, with a well known face\nin the Prodrive no 33 car. TV\npersonality Mike Smith proved that\nhe is a very serious and highly\ntalented driver with third place overall\nin the recent Donington European\nrace, despite the death of his race\nengineer on the way to the circuit.\nPossible F3 winners include the\nFinn Jyrki Jarvilelito (known as JJ\nLehto) Martin Donnelly, John Alcorn,\nRoland Ratzenberger (yes, really!)\nDamon Hill, son of double world\nchampion Graham Hill.\nOn the rally scene the World\nChampionships visits Corsica, island\nof tragedy for the last two years. In\n1986 the brilliant young Finn Henri\nToivonen was killed in the accident\nthat led to the banning of the group\nB 'supercars'. Last year the co-driver\nin a showroom class Peugeot lost his\nlife, showing that the ban was a hasty,\nill-conceived over-reaction.\nExpect the Lancia's to win again\n(they've won every round so far this\nyear) with Massimo Biasion and\nMarkku Alen the drivers.\nCoverage of the San Marino Grand\nPrix will hopefully be live on 'Sunday\nGrandstand', with recorded highlights\non 'Grand Prix', both on BBC2. The\nother events mentioned will be\nrecorded and transmitted later\u2014keep\nchecking your Radio Times for\ndetails. Next week we look at Jaguar's preparations for Le Mans and the\nImperial College connection with\nF3000.\n16 Friday 29th April 1988 FELIX\n\n"

The Kebab Bar is\nserving food during the Southside Bar open hours along with a limited\nrange of drinks.\nICU calls in\nthe police\nImperial College Union President\nSydney Harbour-Bridge has called in\nthe police following a large loss made\nby the Union Snack Bar and Union\nBar over the past year.\nThe disc rep ances came to light\nfollowing the appointment of Reggie\nBlennerhassett as Union Finance\nOfficer. It appears that a large sum\nof money has been un accounted for.\nThe police have interviewed all the\nSnack Bar's and Bar's permanent\nmembers of staff but nobody has been\ncharged.\nSome of the staff are unhappy about\ntheir treatment and the lack of support\nthey have received from the Union.\nOne member of staff, who asked not\nto be named, said that a lot of bad\nfeeling had been created by the\nPresident's action and that they had\nbeen called before the police without\nbeing informed about what was going\non. Deputy President Alan Rose\nrefused to comment on the situation\nbecause it is still being investigated\nby the police.\nNew optician\nThe Health Centre has a new visiting\noptician, Mr D Raz, who will visit the\nCentre on Thursdays.

The\nConsultant Psychiatrist continues to\nattend each week.\nUp in smoke?\nAn advertising campaign based on\nresearch from IC's Department of\nCivil Engineering has been cancelled,\nfollowing complaints from the\nCollege.\nProfessor Robert Perry is\nundertaking an investigation into\nindoor pollution caused by three\ncomponents of tobacco smoke. The\nproject was partly funded by the\nTobacco Advisory Council, which\ncommissioned a campaign reassuring\nthe public about the effects of passive\nsmoking. Professor Perry is the Head\nof the Public Health and Water\nResources Engineering Section, a fact\nwhich is included in the campaign.\nAccording to Professor Perry's work, even a room with a visible\ntobacco haze contains less than two\nper cent of the permitted workplace\nlevel of in hal able particles. He also\nfound that average carbon monoxide\nlevels were less than five per cent and\nnicotine levels less than four per cent\nof the allowed exposures.\nA letter to the Council from\nProfessor Perry concluded the\nfindings 'put into some perspective\nthe relative contribution of\nenvironmental tobacco smoke' to\nindoor air quality, an extract from the\nletter, including the Imperial College\nletterhead, was used in the Council's advertisements. However, College\nDirector of Public Relations, Iain\nMore, said the advertisements 'did\nnot reflect the message the research\nproduced.'\nProfessor Perry agreed that the\nconcentrations of the three\ncomponents which were studied were\nrelatively low, but added 'there are\nanother two hundred down the line\nand they include ones which cause\nirritation and distress to non-smokers'. He also remarked that an\nunderstanding of the components of\nsmoke was different to understanding\ntheir effects on health.\nIain More described the settlement\nwith the Council as 'amicable' in what\nwas a complicated disagreement.\nAlthough about half the College's research funds come from non-Government sources, he had had no\nother problems with sponsors'\nreferences to Imperial College in their\npublicity.\nA Tobacco Advisory Council\nrepresentative has been quoted as\nmaintaining the Council's right to\npromote the Professor's findings if\nImperial were in agreement, adding\n'we still think the research is sound'.\nGovernment\ncracks down\non NUS The Government is to carry out an\nextensive study of the role of student\nunions in universities, polytechnics\nand colleges. The survey, which is to\ninvestigate the costs, organisation and\nlegal status of the unions, will be\npaying particular attention to the\nNational Union of Students.\nEducation Secretary Kenneth Baker\nsaid, in a written answer to the\nCommons, that the Government was\nconcerned that the money paid to\nstudent bodies should be used to\nprovide services for students and not\nfor politics. It also believed that many\nstudents did not want to be\nrepresented by the NUS, though\ntrying to limit membership to\nindividual choice, as some\nConservative MPs suggest could\nprove difficult. This is because many\nstudents are affiliated to the NUS\nthrough their local students unions,\nand restricting the rights of these\nunions to affiliate to the national body\nw oud raise complex legal issues.\nThe NUS is unconcerned about the\nsurvey, which they think will only\nvindicate the students unions, and the\nNUS, and demonstrate the importance\nof the work they carry out for\nmembers.\nRoyal visit\nKing Olav of Norway was the guest\nof the Department of Mineral\nResources Engineering two weeks\nago when he came to Great Britain on\na state visit.\nThe King was shown around an\nexhibition on 'Energy for the Future',\nsponsored by the Norwegian State Oil\nCompany, by Professor John Archer\nand meet students from Norway who\nwere studying for a degree in\nMinerial Resources Engineering.\nShan's Dodgy\nSporting Tips\nCarlisle Z45 Tina's Song\nPlumpton 4.45 Mr Caractacus\nCarlisle 4.25 Tender Whisper\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board and is printed by the Imperial College\nUnion Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel 01-589 5111 ext 3515).

All the\nchildren were doing science courses.\nBritain and Hong Kong come near top\nin all areas, Japan's children are\nmiddling and Americans appear to be\nmorons. These appearances can be\ndeceptive and our results actually\nobscure major holes in our\neducational system.\nThe major differences are that here\nonly 20% of the population are still\nin school at the age range of the tests\nand those people are specialists. It is\nnot surprising that they do well in the\ntests. In both the USA and Japan most\npeople are still at school at the age,\nso, although their actual performance\nmay be worse overall, far more\npeople have some grasp of what the\nsciences are about. In Britain the\npeople not doing the tests are likely\nto be utterly ignorant of the subjects\ninvolved.\nOur education system is therefore\nwidely regarded as producing better\nexperts than anyone else, but the\nexperts are too narrow minded on one\nhand and our general population is\nwoefully ignorant on the other.\nNeither of these facts is likely to\nprove conducive to our national\nsuccess in the long term.\nIf we want to build a productive\nhigh-tech future then we need a population that is educated enough to\ndo our scientific and technical jobs.\nIt is not enough to have a small band\nof experts to do all the technological\ndirty-work: the whole of the\npopulation must be well enough\ngrounded in the basics of science to\nunderstand what is going on. One of\nthe reasons why Britain's workers are\nless efficient than their competitors\nabroad is because they are more\nstupid. Once they have left school (as\nlikely as not with no qualifications)\nthey never again set foot in an\neducational establishment. They don't know enough to understand the\nworkings of the machines they\noperate and therefore they are never\nable to suggest improvements to\nthem. Their lack of training also\nmakes them less versatile and this\nprevents easy switching from one job\nto another. Instead of encouraging\nretraining, unions have often stood\nfirm against changes in working\npractice fossil ising their members\ndiscovery if it was dangled in front\nof their nose.\nBritish universities pride\nthemselves on knowledge for the sake\nof knowledge. There is nothing\ninherently wrong with that except that\nit costs money that might be better\nspent elsewhere. As it is, our whole\ne duct ion system has been distorted to\nkeep the universities supplied with\nexperts. The cost has been a poorer\neconomy and a general population\nwallowing in glorious ignorance. We\ncannot and must not let in continue.\nUNDER THE MICROSCOPE by Steve Black\nlack of versatility.\nBut there are other reasons for\nwanting a well educated populace. If\nall the science is done by a small\ngroup of experts and nobody else\nunderstands what they are doing, the\nmajority can easily become suspicious\nand distrustful of what is going on in\ntheir name. This' is already\nhappening. Many areas of science are\nmistrusted by the public because no\none has taken the effort to explain\nwhat is going on and why.\nSome of the public mistrust may be\njustified. Our education for specialists\noften produces the sort of dedicated\nexpert who knows and cares about\nnothing outside his own field. Such\nexperts have no real sense of public\npurpose. Even if they did have they\nwouldn't be able to communicate it\nto the public. We don't, however,\nneed more applied research (or we\nmight do, but that's another issue), we\njust need experts with a sense of their\nrole in society. We need people who\nappreciate the use or possible use of\ntheir work. We need people who\nknow what society needs and who are\nprepared to keep an eye open for\nscience that might be useful. As it is\nwe have a load of superbly trained\nexperts who couldn't spot a useful\nHistorically the British school\nsystem has been based around the\ntraining of elites (like those who want\nto go to university) and it has become\nvery good at it. But we have tended\nto neglect the rest. But, it is\nimpossible to build a successful\nsociety out of Sun readers.\nIf the universities are to survive\nthen they must convince the rest of\nsociety that they do something useful.\nThey are hardly going to succeed at\nthis if they hang on to their elitist\ntraditions. If science is to survive in\nthis country then we have to explain\nto the people; we have to tell them\nwhat we are doing in a way that they\ncan understand. Then perhaps we will\nget the money to keep the universities\nin a healthy state.\nFermat's Phoenix\nOne of the most intriguing of the\nunsolved problems in mathematics\nwas very nearly solved recently, but\nit staged a last minute recovery.\nFermat's last theorem has been the\nsubject of more attempted proofs than\nany other theorem, probably because\nof its intriguing simplicity. The\ntheorem states that the equation\nX n=Y n+Z\" has no whole number\nsolutions when n is greater than 2.\nFermat, a17 th century French\nmathematician, had a bad habit of\nleaving theorems lying around\nwithout proofs. By the end of the 18th century other scholars had solved\nthem all except this simple one which\ntherefore became known as Fermat's last.\nBecause of the simplicity of the\nequation many non-experts have\nattempted spurious proofs thereof, but\nthese have usually proved to be\ncomplete and utter rubbish. Experts\nin many branches of mathematics\nhave also been attempting proofs ever\nsince the theorem was published, but\nthese have been hardly any more\nsuccessful. This has led to a considerable degree of caution among\nthose who think they might have\ncracked it. The biggest breakthrough\never occurred a few years ago when\nsome pretty weird results were\napplied in a new way to show that the\ntheorem had only a finite number of\nsolutions. The latest attempt at a complete proof was by a Japanese\nmathematician, Yoichi Miyaoka, who\nwas so cautious that he didn't mention\nFermat's theorem by name in the\nwhole of the presentation of his\nresults.\nThe supposed proof involved some\nvery esoteric theorem-juggling\nbetween different areas of\nmathematics and was so complicated\nthat probably only five or so other\npeople in the world were capable of\nunderstanding it. It involved some\ntranslations of problems about\nnumbers into questions about\ngeometry and topology where some\nuseful and powerful theorems exist\nthat can (and have) solved very\ndifficult problems in number theory\nbefore.\nUnfortunately, one of the people\nwho is checking the work has recently\nsaid that there is a balls-up in it.\nSomewhere in the translation process\nfrom numbers to topology, Miyaoka\nused a dod gy theorem. Now it may\nbe that a suitable correct theorem\nexists, but he had assumed that\nanother theorem would be generally\napplicable when it wasn't. More work\nis said to be needed.\nOn the other hand this is widely\nregarded as the best attempt at a proof\nfor years and has broken new ground\nin translating numerical problems into\nother problems that can be more\neasily sorted out. So although this\nparticular proof may be wrong (and\nwe have to wait until the correction\nhas been thoroughly checked) they\nmay at last be going in the right\ndirection.\nFriday 29th April 1988 FELIX\n\n"

Union\nPresident Mr Sydney Harbour-Bridge\ntold FELIX yesterday that such losses\ncould not be accounted for purely\nfrom petty pilfering.\nThe workers in both outlets are\nextremely unhappy about the way that\nthey have been treated. They claim\nthat they have been given no\ninformation about what has been\nhappening, and were told by the\nUnion Office that they had appear at\nan interview by Police Officers\nwithout an explanation. They feel it\nis unfair to effectively sack all the\nstudent casual staff of both outlets\nwithout any evidence that they were\ninvolved in any criminal activity at\nall.\nThe losses were noticed when the\nUnion appointed an accountant to\nkeep the Union Snack Bar and Bar\nbooks in January. Before this, Jen\nHardy-Smith, the Union\nAdminstrator, was handling the\ninvoices and payment for the outlets,\nas well as her normal duties, but had\nsubstantial trading loss, and, on\nfurther investigation, that the Union\nBar was also making less profit than\nit should. This prompted Mr Harbour-Bridge to call in the police\nfor the first time. They advised that\na stock taking system be introduced to\ndiscover where the losses were\noccur ing.

A team then spent two\nweeks watching the entrance to Beit\nQuadrangle but discovered nothing of\nsignificance.\nA second stock take was carried out\nat the end of last term which showed\nthat goods were still disappearing\nfrom both outlets. The police decided\nto carry out interviews with all the\nSnack Bar and Bar staff two weeks\nago. A number of staff were seen but\nno conclusive evidence was\nunearthed. A few members of the\ncasual bar staff admitted to petty\nthefts, indicating that they believed it\nto be 'common practice'. It is still to\nbe decided if they are to be\nprosecuted. The police did, however,\nrecommend that the entire staff be\ndismissed if the huge losses are to\nstop.\nWhen the accounts for 1986/87\nwere returned from the College\nAuditors last week, seven months\noverdue, it was discovered that the\nSnack Bar had made a loss of \u00a33,000\nand not a profit as was previously\nbelieved.

It took two years to come\nto any firm decisions but the Union\nfinally agreed that it would fund the\nproduction of the newspaper. Students\nwould be able to read FELIX free of\ncharge. It was FELIX no 302, edited\nby Oily Dawson, which was the first\nto declare itself editorially and\nfinancially FREE.\nHalf a year later a motion was taken\nto the Union's Council that FELIX\nshould be published weekly and\nincorporate all other ICU publications\nthat had sprung up around it. It was\nalso agreed that the Editor would have\nto become a sabbatical post in order\nto carry out the job satisfactorily, and\nit was accepted that the paper would\nhave to drastically increase its\nadvertising revenue.\nOn Friday 13th September 1974\nFELIX entered a new era when it was\nprinted for the first time by offset litho\non the College premises. This was to\nbe the era of faulty equipment,\nendless nights and tired and emotional\nEditors. It was the final step in a series of attempts to make FELIX\nmore immediate and accessible.\nEditor Mike Williams heralded it as\na chance for a stronger FELIX and\nit was a period of intense optimism\nfor everybody who was involved with\nthe paper. The problems with the\nPrint Unit were still to come.\nFor the next few years FELIX\nbecame a weekly twelve or sixteen\npage booklet, still with a heavy clubs\nand events orientation. It also brought\nout special issues such as its careers\nsupplement, still with us today, the\nFELIX Motor Rally and photographic\ncompetitions. By the end of the\ndecade the Union had invested in a litho and phototypesetting system for\nthe Print Unit so that the FELIX\nOffice was now producing the\nHandbook, Alternative Prospectus\nand the Phoenix. The Office had also\nmoved down to a suite in Beit Arch,\nmaking the paper even more\naccessible to the average student.\nIt must have seemed that FELIX\nhad everything going for it but both\nthe Seventies and the Eighties have\nseen major clashes between Union\nOfficers and the FELIX Editors. In\n1976 a motion of no confidence in\nEditor Clive Dewey was proposed by\nboth the Union and his own staff over\nhis handling of the staff and the dire\nfinancial situation he had allowed the\npaper to get in after spending most of\nhis budget on one issue in the Autumn\ncontinued on page 15\nACCOMMODATION: FROM ONE HOSTEL TO HALLS, HOUSES AND HEAD TENANCIES\nWhen FELIX was first published in 1949, there was only one hostel for use by IC students,\nBeit Old Hostel. Residents were not allowed overnight guests in any shape or form and were\nwoken up by bells every morning.\nDespite the addition of a new hostel in No 12 Princes Gardens for 24 men, hall capacity still\nlagged far behind demand and the Union complained that this was the reason very few students\nwere interested in Union affairs.\nCollege decided that it was time to build more accommodation and took on an ambitious\nplan to build halls of residence around Princes Gardens. The first hall was Weeks, donated by\nVickers in return for guaranteed places for their engineering students. Unfortunately after Weeks\nhad been built they discovered that the concrete they had used could be dissolved by water!\nThe next halls were Southside and Linstead with plans to build a sports centre and another\nhall on the Northside site\u2014when the money ran out.\nThe only addition that has since been made to the site was an extension to Linstead made\npossible by a mystery donation of \u00a3350,000.

Between the\nyears 1953 and 1962 the student population of this College will be expanded from 1500 to over 3000, To accomodate the extra numbers the College\nand Union Buildings will be added\nto, and in son. cases, modified.\nIt is a vast or oj ect, involving the\nexpenditure of \u00a315 millions of public funds.\nDuring the past eighteen ra on th s four preliminary projects have been\nput in hand.

After the Island Site, Blackett,\nand Roderick Hill Aeronautical Engineering\nBlock had been completed, W2 now affectionately known as the Huxley\nBuilding \u2014was built to house the ever-expanding Physics Department, Mathematics\nand Computing.\nThe most recent addition to IC has been the\nnew Computing Building next to the walkway\nwhich should be opened any year now!\nW2N early-there!\nThe\n, 1\n1\ncomplete and the building should bp ready by the beginning of lerm.

Contractors\nwork on the replacement\nof the blocks started at\nthe beginning of the\nsummer at a cost estimated\nto be in the region of\n\u00a340,000.\nThere is speculation\nas to why the blocks are\nfalling apart. Mr. P.W. Throsby, Harden of Weeks\nHall, suggested that it\nmight be 'natural decay\nj fall down? The answer\noba bly not, but in the long\nii lit y.

Clarke, Nicholls\nand Marcel, were appointed\nat a cost of \u00a38,000 to\nassess the hall by means\nof a physical test in vol v in deflect o meters pi\nby the Civil Engit\nvideo\nDepartment here at IC. It would appear that\nfurther internal reinforcement work on each\nroom is a possibility\nwhich is not being ruled\nout. Meanwhile, it has\njust been learnt that\nWeeks Hall will be\nevacuated for at least\nthe first term. Presumably\nthe hall residents will be\nfiltered into places in\nresidence created by\nstudents who fail their\nexams and Vlth former s who fail their A levels.

Debate raged for three years until a referendum\nwas held. Unsurprisingly the student body wanted more say in who was their\nelected representative.\nDuring the late Sixties the Union became very much more political, as was\nreflected in the FELICES of that time and the Seventies were a time of great\nUnion management expansion when FELIX Editor and Deputy President\nbecame sabbatical posts.\nTHE.

The original\nplans in 1980 were that the\nmoney should go towards\nimproving student residence, but\nit has since been discovered by\nUnion Officers that the grounds\nare held in trust by the Governing Body and that the intention\nof the original agreement was\nthat ail money raised from their\nsale should be used only to\nprovide further sporting facilities\nfor students.\nNo 630 3rd December 1982\nHarlington gravel has been news in\nFELIX throughout the Eighties. A detailed report of what the money\nshould be used for was front page\nnews in 1982 but six years on\nnone of it has been spent on the\nstudents.\nThe Eighties have also seen the\nCollege keen to get their hand on\nthe Union Building for the\nexpansion of the Biology\nDepartment and as a centre for\nshort courses. In 1982 College\nSecretary John Smith urged the\nUnion to accept his proposals that\nthe Union facilities be placed in the\nbasement of Southside. The\nproposals were rejected.\nThe College was more\nsuccessful in 1986 when, due to\na weak Union Executive, the\nBot/Zoo Common Room and Old\nFELIX Office in Beit Arch were\ngiven away to Biology because\nCollege had given the Union\ncontrol of the Union Bar.\nThe Union is still in a strong\nposition today with a completely\nnew management plus the\nappointment of a Finance Officer\nand Union Manager.\nterm. There was bitter\ncorrespondence over his alleged bias.\nEventually he was only censured at\na Union General Meeting and it was\nagreed that a FELIX Business\nManager should be created who\nwould authorise any payments so as\nto avoid any further potentially\ndisastrous financial years.\nIn 1979 FELIX was charged with\n'profiteering' in its charges to Union\nclubs. In a bitterly fought FELIX\nEditor's election, one candidate John\nShuttleworth 'exposed' the fact that\nthe Editor was charging for paper\nplates and labour when all FELIX had\nto pay for was the paper. Shuttleworth\nwent on to win and take the Union to\ncourt after he failed his summer\nexams and was not considered to be\nof 'good academic standing', one of\nthe conditions of taking up a sabbatical post. He lost his fight.\nThe next controversial year was\n1981 when Editor Steve Marshall also\nfaced a motion of No Confidence at\naUG M. There had been 'growing\ndissatisfaction' with his editorship\nwhich accusations of bias, misleading\nstories and personal vendettas.\nThe FELIX of the Eighties has had\nits share of controversies. It has been\ncriticised as being stodgy and boring\none minute, biased and critical the\nnext. In recent years' it has been\nforced out of Beit Arch to a basement\nin the north side of the Quadrangle\nin exchange for more sophisticated\nprinting equipment and more space.\nIt has always come out on a Friday\nno matter what accidents have\nbefallen it. It has faced the threat of\ncensorship by the Union. But it is still\nin the strongest position it has been\nfor several years with an average of\ntwenty pages each week.\nFELIX has seen eight hundred\nissues come and go and since 1949 it\nhas remained the newspaper of\nImperial College provided by the\nUnion to inform, criticise and\nentertain the students of Imperial.\nThe FELIX spirit\ntaken from FELIX no 100, December\n1956:\nThis Spirit of Felix ie always evident.\nSome Editors produced \"stodgy\" issues, some\nwere very frivolous. But I.C. news and views\nhave always been faithfully recorded and the\npaper has always spoken its mind. The spirit hf;P been passed on by successive Editorial Boards. They have worked re a team an with\nan enthusiasm that defies analysis. Editors\ncame and' went - few could stand up to the\nracket for more than half a dozen issues.

There were mumbled\nwords of reassurance, but all knew\ndeep down in their hearts the truth that\nhad been starkly shown, the naked\ntruth that no one could now ignore.\nNo, this was not the latest horror\nvideo. This was a programme\ninfinitely more disturbing. Doctors to\nbe, the Horizon series really pulled\nout the stops on Sunday night,\nproviding a feast of exam pressure\nwith those who passed and failed in\ndisturbing close-up detail. The\nanguish shown on the faces is real,\n'I know because I was there'. Yes, I failed my exams (one of four) in\nsummer and I opened that little brown\nenvelope with my typed name on it.\nOne of the most disturbing facts\nwas the number of people I failed to\nrecognise in the programme. It does\nnothing to the confidence when you\nsee people just as able as you being\nasked to leave the school. A couple\neach year (especially after the second\nyear) fail to make the grade who\nreally did want to be doctors and spent\nmost of their life attempting to\nachieve their ambition.\nIt is not the same as Biochemistry\nor Physics, Electronics or Life\nScience. Medicine is a vocation, there\nis an undefinable element that makes\npeople want to be doctors. I never\ndecided to be a doctor, but I know\nnow I could be nothing else. This\nmakes the anguish and the failures so\nmuch more painful. One almost wept\nto see the faces of those who failed.\nMaybe a good thing about this\nprogramme is that the pressure side\nof medical school is seen, and that it\nisn't all fun and games. If that greater\nunderstanding is revealed then there\nhas been a benefit. I do wonder\nhowever, how many people will have\nbeen put off medicine due to that\nprogramme on Sunday?\n4 Friday 29th April 1988 FELIX\n\n"

An independent report into the running of College finance has slammed\nthe Finance Office for 'working in an environment of continual crisis\nwithout adequate computer systems of sufficient experienced staff.'\nThe Office, which deals with all\nCollege Research contracts and the\npayment of every Imperial College\nbill, has been having major problems\nthroughout the year, with its new\n1N TAC computer system.\nAs reported in FELIX last term, the\nFinance Section lost a great deal of\ninformation when the computer went\ndown for four days. They have since\nbeen trying to retrieve their records\nand sort out the system.\nThe report by Management\nConsultants Deloitte, Hoskins and\nSells states that there are 'serious\ninadequacies' in the accounting\npackage which the College installed\nin the Summer of 1986. It says that\nthe operating procedures had been\ntackled by 'extensive ad-hoc in house\ndevelopment' and the users had\nmodified the original package so\nmuch that it placed undue reliance on\nthe College resources. It is no longer\npossible to use the supplier's knowledge to fix any problems that\nnow occur with the package.\nThe problems with this system have\nresulted in bills going unpaid for\nnearly six months and suppliers\nrefusing to carry on delivering to the\nCollege.\nOne source told FELIX that the\nRefectories Section had to send out\n'runners' with manually-drawn\ncheques in order to secure deliveries\neach day.\nThe report suggests that the College\nrevert to a manual system for the rest\nof the financial year until the\nconfusion has been sorted out. It also\nsuggests that the present computing\nsystem should only be used for basic\naccounting functions until a totally\nnew accounting package, more suited\nto the College's needs, is installed for\nthe 1989/90 academic year.\nOne of its other recommendations\nis that 'outside assistance' might be\nrequired in order to have the end of\nyear accounts ready in time, which\nwill cost the College even more\nmoney.\nIt says that the departments should\ntake on more of the administration\nside of the finance system and\nrecommends that a pilot scheme on\nResearch Contract approval and\nOrder Production should be initiated.\nThe report indicates that this could be\ndone by de-central ising part of the\nFinance Section: 'a complement of 80\nstaff appears large to operate a computerised finance function in an\norganisation of Imperial's size'. It\nsuggests that some of the staff could\nbe transferred out to departments once\nthe current problems have been sorted\nout.\nIt is unknown, however, how much\nthe recent events have cost the\nCollege. As well as paying for the\noriginal accounting package and the\nextensive Management Consultants\nreport, a great deal of staff time has\nbeen spent trying to work the new\ncomputer system. Academics and\nadministrators have also had to spend\ntime chasing unpaid invoices through\nthe Finance Section, and explaining\nto suppliers about the problems.\nIt is also unclear as to how much\na new computer system that could\nfulfil the College's requirements\nwould cost.\nFire in Linstead\nPhew, what a scorcher!\nLinstead Hall in Princes Gardens was\nevacuated early on Wednesday\nmorning after a resident's room was\nset alight.\nWarren Duffin, a first year\nMathematics student, raised the alarm\nwhen his coffee maker caught fire and spread to his curtains. The fire\nbrigade was called but the blaze had\nalready been put out using fire\nextinguishers.\nEye witnesses told FELIX that\nthere was a great deal of smoke\nbillowing from the room.\nMr Duffin's curtains were badly\nsinged and his coffee maker was\ndestroyed. Also many of his\npossessions were soaked by the fire\nextinguishers.\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL. COLLEGE UNION "

The motion springs from a suggestion that loans should be introduced\nin a letter from the Department of\nEducation and Science that found its\nway to the national press in early\nOctober. The problem its creates immediately is whether it was intended\nas bluff or as a feeler prior to some\ndefinite action. However, it probably\nheralds a hardening of attitude towards increase in student grants.\nIn view of the element of doubt,\nMr. Cavanagh fee is that, like NUS,\nICU should act as though it is a No 223 1st December 1965\nThe threat of student loans has been with us\nfor well over twenty years now. Successive\nConservative governments have tentatively\nsuggested them to test public opinion. In the\nSixties grants were already under fire and have\nnever increased as much as inflation each\nyear.\nWith the swing of public opinion to the Right\nin the Eighties, it is almost a certainty that\nstudent loans will be introduce in the Nineties.\nCOCKROACH\nMENU AT\nCOLLEGE\nSTUDENTS at aLoi. dc n college protested angrily about\" the cockroaches.

It was\ndifficult to imagine how they could\npossibly follow it. With Waiting for\nBonaparte they haven't disappointed.\nHow Green is the Valley was a fiery\ncollection of music designed to bring\nto the boil an angry rebellious side in\nall but the most passive listener. The\nlatest album heralds a new era for The\nMen They Couldn't Hang. Gone are\nthe political anthems of their previous\ntwo albums. Instead deeper lyrics\nconcentrate on more subtle issues,\nnotably on a nautical theme.\nAmongst the fast-moving tales of\nsmuggling, legacies and marine life\nis the obligatory slow ballad\u2014now a trademark of TMTCH's albums.\nIsland in the Rain takes off where\nScarlet Ribbons and Parted From You\nhave previously. A memory of lost\nlove ghosting on an empty beach, this\nis a song that will strike a chord with\nanyone who longs for the past and\nwhat might have been.\nA review of this album would be\nincomplete without mentioning the\nnew single. The Colours is quite\nsimply a masterpiece\u2014the last speech\nof a convicted mutineer on the\nscaffold. He gives an alternative\ndefinition of the Union flag:\n'Red is the colour of the new\nrepublic,\nBlue is the colour of the sea,\nWhite is the colour of my\ninnocence,\nNo surrender to your mercy'\nIncluded with initial copies of the\nalbum is a song book containing\nmusic and lyrics of a selection of\nsongs from all three albums.\nIf you only buy one album this\nyear, make sure it is Waiting for\nBonaparte\u2014you won't be\ndisappointed.\nPaul Shanley\nGhostdance\nAfter hearing their first compilation\nalbum, and looking at the audience\n.queueing outside, I expected\nGhostdance to be a hardcore goth\noutfit. Then, when they emerged,\nthere wasn'ta piece of black clothing\nto be seen on the band. They also had\na very 'pop' sound, and with their\nvocalist's incredible voice, I wouldn't be surprised to see them getting near\nthe top 40.\nMac\n-W fl fO British films are often delightfully\nfunny and almost always sadly\nrealistic. 'Wish You Were Here' is\ncertainly no exception. What else\ncould you expect from David Leland,\nthe director of 'Mona Lisa\"?\nSet in a small seaside town in postwar Britain, and loosely based on the\nearly life of Cynthia Payne, the film\nfollows the transformation of 15 year\nold Linda (Emily Lloyd) from\ninnocent adolescent to not-at-all\ninnocent and very pregnant\nadolescent.\nIt's good fun, and provides\nextremely pleasant entertainment.\nThis is one of that rare breed of film,\na box office smash which is just as\ngood when tr an fer red to television.\nAndrew Clarke\nCUT THE KRAP\n\u2022 Cut 'n' Blow Dry \u00a35.00\nWednesday 10am onwards\nin the Ents Room (above the\nNew FELIX Office)\nYeah, I know, so it's summer and that\nmeans exams and that means revision\nbut come on, when has that really\nmade any difference? I mean, there\nare priorities! Take the Soup\nDragons. Now, admittedly I'd always\nthought they were pretty lacking when\nit came to sparkle, but when I saw\nthem live they were actually quite\ngood. But not good enough to deserve\nall the acclaim heaped on them by the\nmusic press last .year. Their best\nmusic always fell just short of\nexciting, but a miss is as good as a mile, or so I'm told. Good as a support band but really just another\nguitar group. They're on at the Town\nand Country Club tonight.\nNow the Jesus and Mary Chain.\nThey really can deliver the goods and\ntonight they're playing an 'intimate'\ngig at UL U, which basically means\nif you go to the bar you'll miss half\nthe show. But I always thought that\nthe Chain went down better in the\natmosphere of a smaller venue, so\ndon't be put off. They're promoting\ntheir compilation of b sides and out-takes, 'Barbed Wire Kisses', released\nlast week. Moody, yes. Blunt,\ndefinitely; but this can really never\ndisguise what it basically is: a collection of near-misses, not-quite s. Put it this way; 'Sidewalking' is the\nbest thing on it, and the only other\nmoments of consequence are 'Kill\nSurf City' and 'Surfin' USA'. And,\nat a pinch, 'Happy Place'.\nSunday sees the return of Throwing\nMuses to the Town and Country Club.\nAn extraordinary blend of psychedelia\nand folk tinged with just about every\nother musical style you can think of.\nSupported by the equally good Pixies.\nLast time, these two bands together\nproduced a gig which was heralded\nas the best of the year, and among the\naudience were many people of note\nfrom the world of music. Expect the\nsame again!\nAlbum Review:\n'Lovely'\u2014The Primitives\nThis classic album opens with the\nversion of 'Crash' which stormed the\ncharts last term. A surprise for those\nof us who expected to hear the 1986\nversion which sounded like Jesus and\nMary Chain would have had Debbie\nHarry sung for them. None the less,\na pleasant surprise, for this was pop\nmusic at its best. The rest of the album\nwas as expected. More Mary Chainesque sounds with 'Spacehead',\n'Nothing Left', 'Stop Killing Me' and\n'Buzz Buzz Buzz'. While 'Carry Me\nHome' is pure Monkees, 'Shadow' is\nstraight from '67 and 'Thru the\nFlowers' and 'Ocean Blue' approach\nAll About Eve. 'Dreamwalk Baby',\n'Run Baby Run', 'Don't Want\nAnything to Change', 'I 'll Stick With\nYou' and 'Out of Reach' represent the\nsound I expect The Primitives will be\nsticking to from now on, in the same\n| groove as 'Crash'. My only complaint\nis the absence of 'Really Stupid'\nwhich is brilliant, but luckily this is\non the b side of the latest single, 'Out\nof Reach'. To summarise? This is\nwhat pop music should be all about.\nFELIX Friday 29th April 1988 19\n\n"

While\ngrants and awards have fallen in value\nby 21%, parental contributions\nincreased by 86% (\u00a3480) on average.\nHowever, a large part of the increase\nin income may be accounted for by\nthe value of covenanted tax rebates\nwhich are estimated to have risen an\naverage from \u00a365 to \u00a3211 and which\nhave been phased out in the last\nbudget.

    "content": "continued from the front\nbe dismissed and the Snack Bar closed\nuntil the position of its permanent\nmembers of staff had been reviewed.\nICU Deputy President Alan Rose,\nwho has overall responsibility for the\nUnion's trading outlets, was not told\nof Tuesday's meeting and was only\ninformed of the decisions that had\nbeen made yesterday morning. Mr\nRose was said to be extremely\nconcerned that he had not been\npresent at such an important meeting\nor kept informed of crucial decisions\nwhich had been made.\nThe casual bar staff were informed\nof their dismissal yesterday morning\non the grounds of pilfering.\nBoth Mr Norman Jardine, the\nSnack Bar Manager, and Mr Mark\nAnderson, his Deputy, were sent\nletters by the President yesterday\nafternoon. In them Mr HarbourBridge said that they had been\nsuspended on full pay in view of their\n'acknowledged misconduct' of their\nhandling of stock. When they were\ntold of their suspension, they were\nescorted off Union premises.\nMr Harbour-Bridge told FELIX\nthat the Snack Bar would be closed\nuntil the beginning of next academic\nyear. He is unwilling to re-open the\nSnack Bar if the inquiry decides to\nreinstate the permanent staff, and\nthere would be nobody to run the\noutlet if they did lose their jobs. The\nUnion Bar will also be closed for the\nduration of the Summer vacation. He\nsaid that this would enable vital\nrefurbishment work to take place in\nboth outlets.\nThe Union Bar will be run on\nskeleton staff for the rest of the term\nas no more casuals are to be\nemployed. The present Union Bar\nManager Adrian Johnson has agreed\nto stay on as Deputy Bar Manager and\na new permanent bar worker is to be\nemployed. Meanwhile both Mr\nHarbour-Bridge and Honorary\nSecretary Chas Jackson will be\nhelping Mr Johnson run the Bar. Mr\nJackson told FELIX that the Bar\nwould be working on restricted\nopening times. He said that it would\nnot be open during weekend\nlunchtimes and three nights a week.\nMr Harbour-Bridge said that he was\n'very grateful to Jelly (Mr Johnson)\nfor being so reasonable about the\nwhole thing.' He added that all the\nBar locks had been changed\nyesterday.\nMr Harbour-Bridge said that he\ncould only justify his decision on the\nbasis that \u00a335,000 had been lost from\nthe Snack Bar and \u00a3 6 , 0 0 0 from the\nBar. He said that he could have\nsacked the staff who were suspected\nof petty pilfering but if he had got the\nwrong people it 'would have been far\nworse' than sacking everybody.\nYou may have been surprised to see\na FELIX out on a Thursday rather\nthan a Friday. This is a special\nflysheet issue to keep you up-to-date\non the events as they occur in the\nUnion Office, Snack Bar and Bar.\nThere will be a normal size FELIX\nout tomorrow with more news as it\nhappens.\nI hope that you have taken time to\nread the news story. It is important\nto remember that nobody has been\ncharged by the police for theft yet.\nThere are a great deal of interesting\ntheories flying around the Union at\nthe moment but none of them has been\nsubstantiated. I hope that most of us\nstill believe in 'innocent until proven\nguilty'.\nI think that Syd and his\n'investigator y committee' have acted\nas they believe is best for the Union\n(in the long run). They made some\ntough decisions, ones which I would\nnot have liked to have made. It\nconcerns me that the justification of\nhis actions was purely monetary. He\ndoes not seemed to have considered\nthe people involved. They have\nsacked the innocent to get at the\npossible guilty. They have sacked\npeople who have worked very hard\nfor the Union; who have put a great\ndeal of extra time and effort into their\njobs. They have split the Union into\ntwo.\nPossible theft is always a very\ndifficult situation, but there is no\nexcuse for the way that the Union staff\nhave been treated. One thing the\nPresident, and the Union, must learn\nis that it is important not only to be\nfair, but to be seen to be so.\nBoycott! Total lack of communication Dear Judith,\nI write with reference to the recent\npolice investigation relating to the\nUnion Bar and Snack Bar, which\ninvestigated losses from these outlets.\nWhile I accept that the\ncircumstances prevailing could not\ncontinue as they were, I feel that the\nmanner in which the investigation was\nconducted was an outright insult to the\nmany people who have worked hard\nand consistently over extended\nperiods of time in these outlets.\nThere has been a total lack of\ncommunication between the Union\nOffice and the staff, and this has\ncreated much bad feeling. For\nexample, this must be the first time\nthat staff members in any institution\nhave been forced to book\nappointments with police officers.\nNone of the staff were informed by\nthe Union Office of the reason for\ntheir interrogation, and so the\ninformation we eventually managed\nto glean resulted from unsubstantiated\nand often am big io us rumours. This\nwas information that should have been\npresented by right to all those\nconcerned, preferably in writing.\nThe whole charade has been\nappallingly organised. Some people,\nin the midst of revising for vital\nexams, had their appointments with\nthe police re timed on several\noccasions, only to have them\ncancelled completely. Again, no\nexplanation has been forthcoming.\nThe final outcome appears to be a decision to sack all the members of\nUnion Bar casual staff, staff who rely\nheavily on money earned in the Bar\nto live on. Surprisingly enough, once\nagain no explanation has been given.\nThe ex-staff are now treated as an\nobject of constant scrutiny and\nsuspicion, suspicion that is in all\ncases, both unfounded and untrue.\nI look forward to hearing an\nexplanation of these events in the near\nfuture, though I must say this seems\nunlikely.\nI would also like to thank you for\nthe support given by FELIX in these\nmatters.\nName withheld by request.\nDear Judith,\nToday we were told that following\nthe discrepancies found after\nstock taking for the period Summer\u2014\nXmas '87 subsequent to which a brief\npolice investigation was carried out,\na blanket dismissal of the Union Bar\nstaff has been executed.\nWhilst an investigation into the\nlosses is obviously warranted, sacking\neverybody in sight is not going to\nsolve the mystery and only serves to\npunish those members of staff who\nare innocent. Many of us were not\neven employed for the majority of the\nperiod over which the loss was\nincurred.\nApart from the loss of much-needed\nweekly income essential to\nsupplement the insufficient London\ngrant, this also puts an unjust slur on\nthe characters of many honest\nstudents. Are we likely to get a job\nelsewhere in College after such\nindirect libel?\nNot everyone was interviewed by\nthe police and yet everyone was\ndismissed. Is this fair treatment? It is\nknown that the losses accumulated\nover a period of time (prior to '88\nalthough it has been put that it still\ncontinues)\u2014the sum involved, about\n\u00a36000\u2014to penal is e recently employed\nstaff seems non-sens ical. Jelly is now the only member of\nstaff still working\u2014it could not\nfunction without him and the plan is\nto employ outside temporary staff\nwhich will cost the Union more and\nimplies that no IC student is\ntrustworthy enough to work in this\nbar. We feel that this whole affair has\nand still is being handled badly, and\nif we cannot be reinstated then those\nof us who are innocent would like our\nnames to be cleared along with an\napology for the off-hand manner in\nwhich we have been treated.\nWe understand the Union's position\nin this matter, but feel that this is not\nthe right course of action.\nUntil this is cleared up, we would\nbe grateful if all IC students, staff etc\nwould boycott the Union Bar (if only\nto make Jelly's job easier!).\nYours faithfully,\nDebbie Nolder, Cath Maxwell &\nJeff Lloyd\non behalf of the Union Casual and\nBar Staff.\nPS.

    "content": "Features\nTomorrow's Rag Fete is,\nas usual, going to be the\nevent of the year\nfor anyone with\na slightly off\nbeat sense of\nhumour.\nEastenders fans\ncan also thrill to\nguest\nappearances by\nMatilda Ziegler\n(Donna) and\nLucy Bayler\n(Elizabeth) who\nlaunch the event\non the Queen's Lawn at\n2.30pm. Although people with an aversion to\nsoap operas are strongly advised to\nmiss the opening, the rest of the day\npromises something for everyone.\nKeep fit by running up and down the\nQueen's Tower, eat a Chaps curry,\npelt Union notables with wet sponges,\nbuy lots of very old Rag Mags... .what\ntremendous fun for all the family,\nespecially for those of a more\nbarbarian nature. If you really want\nto get vindictive you can hire QTSoc\nto attack a friend. Preferably one you\ndon't mind losing.\nA little light entertainment will be\nprovided by a display team from the\nBomb Disposal Squad, who should\nalso be equipped to deal with the\nexplosions from the balloon throwing\nstall. Science fiction videos will\nabound, courtesy of Rag Fete\norganiser and ex-SFSoc chair being Dave Clements.\nTurning one's at ten ion to more\npractical matters, non-veggies may be\nglad to discover the burger and pig\nroast stalls, as well as the inimitable\nChaps Curry emporium. There will\nalso be a bar until five o 'clock.\nGamblers will rejoice at the larger\nnumber of ways to try their luck and\nwin mind-boggling prizes. Rag\nproudly presents the tom bola, the\nhuman fruit machine(!) and, of\ncourse, the Rag Raffle. Tickets for the\nraffle can be bought at the Fete or\nfrom an itinerant Rag Rep; the first\nprize is a weekend in Paris. The draw\nwill take place sometime during the\nafternoon, as will the presentation of\nlast year's Rag money.\nThe grand finale of Rag Fete is that\ngreat British institution, mud\nwrestling. Organised by Fiona\nNicholas, RCSUVP/Rag Chair\nelect/Ladies' Rugby Team supremo,\nit promises to be fairly messy. No\ndoubt lots of well known\nexhibitionists will participate purely\nfor the beautifying effect of mud, but\nthere should be some scope for taking\nembarrassing photographs.\nAfter everyone has removed mud\nfrom their hair, clothes and other\nplaces, there will be a big party in the\nUnion Building, run by ICU Ents\nuntil the small hours.\nMeanwhile, Raggies will gather\nsomewhere in the Queen's Tower at\n6.30pm for the Rag AGM.

    "content": "Cookery Club\nA gastronomic\nsurvey of the world\nThe summer is coming up. Many\nstudents will no doubt travel around\nEurope on Interrail, others might be\nmore fortunate to find themselves in\nmore exotic parts of the world. One\nshould avail this rare opportunity for\nenjoying the cuisine of the host\nnation, yet one is not always sure\nwhat dishes to be on the look out for\nor equally importantly where to eat.\nI have negotiated with Judith a brief\nto write articles that try to address\nthese issues.\nI would like to write articles on\neating out in Spain, France, Italy,\nGreece, Middle-Eastern countries,\nIndia and the Far East. I will try and\ncover the more popular student\ndestinations before the others.\nI am relying on the international\ncommunity at Imperial College to\ngive me the necessary information to\nbe able to write suitable articles. Full\ncredit will be given for any\ninformation that is used. I can be\ncontacted on int 4412 or 4320.1 will\nbe most happy to meet anyone with\nuseful tips at a time and place of their\nchoosing. I depend on YOU!!\nA Summer festival\nThe arrival of the summer means a significant change to the food we eat.\nA sample of the things that I will be\nmaking over the summer include a rich strawberry mousse, chicken\ntikka, and a sangria to quench the\nthirst.\nChicken Tikka\nThis simple dish became legendary in\nHolbein House when I served it at a barbecue accompanied with freshly\nmade corr i ander chutney. The recipe\nis simple.\nIngredients:\n8 chicken thighs\nI inch long piece of ginger root\n4 cloves garlic\nJuice of a whole lemon\n1 tsp red chilli\n1 tsp ground corr i and er'A tsp t umm eric1 tsp ground cum min'A tsp freshly ground pepper\n]\nA tsp salt\n4 heaped tablespoons of whole milk\nyogurt\nI tsp 'garr am masala'\n(Garram masala can be pur ched at all\nIndian grocers. It is made by grinding\nequal parts of black pepper, cum min cinnamon, cloves and black\ncar dom mom pods. A little of this\nfragrant powder can be sprinkled over\nany Indian dish a minute before\nserving to impart it with a great\naroma.)\nMethod:\n1. Remove the skin from the thighs,\nand cut the pieces into two.\n2. Prepare the marinade by finely\nchopping the garlic and the ginger,\nthen blend it with the rest of the\ningredients.\n3. Add the chicken pieces to the\nmarinade and refrigerate the mixture\novernight.\n4. Cook the chicken pieces under the\ngrill on high heat until they begin to\nlightly brown. You might like to add\na little of the marinade that is left over\nthe chicken. Continue cooking on low\nheat until well cooked, basting with\na little oil as the cooking proceeds.\nSangria\n1 was told how to make this regal\nconcoction by Maria Issabella from\nBilbao. She tells me that she makes\na heavy duty sangria by adding\nCointreau and other goodies to the\nstandard recipe. Unless you want to\nget stone drunk over the summer I would stick to the recipe below.\nIngredients (for ten people):\n4 litres ordinary red wine\n2.5 litre orange juice\n4 oranges\n2 lemons\n2 bananas\n2 peaches\n1 large cinnamon stick\nSugar\nMethod:\n1. Chop the fruits into chunks.\n2. Add all the red wine to the fruits,\nthe cinnamon. Add sugar to taste\n3. Cover and leave to lie outside for\n6 hours.\n4. Add the orange juice to the mixture\nand refrigerate overnight. Drink it the\nnext afternoon. I recommend that you\nthen sit back to watch the cricket on\nthe box.\nThe summer festival will continue in\nnext week's FELIX.\nBye for now,\nYishu Nanda,\nHead Chef, FELIX.\n40mm^m mm \u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u2022 . . . . . . . \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022 .\nI A ROOM WITH\nA VIEW\nICU Honorary Secretary\nChas Jackson\nChas Jackson, Imperial College\nUnion's Honorary Secretary was born\nin Todmorden, West Yorkshire in\n1964. He admits to having enjoyed his\nschool days although he says that he\nhad a fairly traumatic childhood. He\ncame to Imperial in 1982 to study for\na degree in Chemical Engineering,\nwhich he finally obtained last year.\nDuring his six years at Imperial, he\nhas lived in a wide range of College\naccommodation and is presently\noccupying a single room on the\nnot th side of Falmouth-Keogh Hall in\nthe Southside Halls of Residence.\nHis first year was spent sharing a room with two other students in\nMining House, one of the Evelyn\nGardens houses. He became very\nactive in the House and was selected\nas a re-applicant for his second year.\nFor the next few years he lived in\nseveral flats in both Hamlet Gardens\nand Lexham Gardens.\nHe prefers living in the flats to halls\nor houses because he likes a kitchen\nto himself rather than having to share\nit with eighty other residents. When\nhe does cook in Southside, which is\nabout three times a week, he takes\nover the kitchens later on in the\nevening to avoid the peak times when\ntwenty students are trying to cook on\ntwo cookers. He says that has no\nregrets about not having lived in\nSouthside during his first year\nbecause it is much more impersonal\nthat Mining House was.\nChas' room not only contains the\nusual bed, desk, chair and sink but\nalso a fridge, a stereo, and half a bicycle propped up against the wall.\nHe says that the room is just\nbeginning to reflect his personality\nafter eight months. \"It's very difficult\nto do anything with a Southside\nroom\", he claims. His major problem\nwas trying to erase the personality of\nits last occupant. \"I used to spend a lot of time in this room when Gutman\n(last year's Honorary Secretary) lived\nin it. I found it a bit hard getting used\nto the idea that it was now my room\nand not his.\"\nHis favourite possession is his pre-amp, an impressive instrument with\na built-in oscilloscope that shows the\nwaveforms of the music while it's playing. \"It helps to impress the\ngir lies\", he jokes. He prefers\nlistening to his large record collection\nwhen he got time to relax rather than\nsitting and watching the television on\ngallery level like most FalmouthKeogh residents.\nChas has a surprising amount of\nbooks on his shelves, most of which\nare science fiction or Chem Eng text\nbooks. His book collection and all his\nother possessions get more and more\nevery year. He had to use a transit to\nmove into his latest room even though\nhe had junked quite a lot of stuff\nbeforehand.\nI asked him what his future plans\nwere after he leaves Imperial?\n\"To earn enough money to run a car\", he says.\nFELIX Friday 29th April 1988 7\n\n"
