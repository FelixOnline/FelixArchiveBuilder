    "content": "2 News\nUnexpected Week-long Nursery Closure\nBY SHAUN JOYNSON\nImperial College students and staff\nhave breathed a sigh of relief on\nlearning that the College Nursery in\nPrinces Gardens is to re-open\ntoday, Friday 10th December.\nThe Nursery was closed with\nless than one day's notice on Friday\n3rd December after a series of\ndisagreements between staff led to\nwhat the Director of Personnel and\nAdministrative Services, Caroline\nFox, called a 'breakdown in\ncommunications'.\nThe disagreements, which began\nearlier this year, have led to a number of staff threatening to\nresign. These disagreements appear\nto be personality clashes rather than\nconflicts in teaching styles and\ncentre on one or two members from\na total staff of around half a dozen.\nThe Nursery cares for staff\nchildren as well as children of\nstudents and has been in operation\nat the College for a number of\nyears. It is paid for mainly by\nparental contributions, with some\nsubsidy from the Union and\nCollege authorities.\nCaroline Fox said that the decision to close the Nursery had been\ntaken because, had the resignations\nthreatened by staff gone ahead, the\nNursery would have had an\ninsufficient number of experienced\nstaff. \"We did look at the\npossibility of using agency staff,\nbut there were none available,\" she\nsaid.\nDespite the staff problems, Ms\nFox is adamant that the children's care was not affected. \"Nurseries\nare strictly controlled under the\n1989 Children Act, which stipulates\nthat the children must be under\ncontinuous supervision at all times.\nOur aim is now, and has always\nbeen, to put child care first and if\nthere had been insufficient number\nof staff to ensure this, then we\nwould not have opened,\" she told\nFelix.\nShe added that she would be\ntaking a conciliatory line with staff\nand trying to sort the matters out to\neveryone's satisfaction. Wpxried\u2014\nparents^get fr ered' at a meeting on\nWednesday and were told of the\nrather than just one single\noccurrence.\nMs Fox does, however, believe\nthat the staff can sort out these\nproblems given time: \"Parents bond\n**ii\ny\",J tT|n gly with individual staff\nmembers that work in the Nursery.\nMany haye come back after mater-pro bl eras and of the, ef for^ be ir ig1n it yle a vl with their first child. We\nmade t of resolve the differences:\nOne factor that4& th t pg lft s tk\nhave been a contributory'factor in\nthe staff pro bl \u00a3fl is% i|5* Jh'\"ei ir| pid\nexpansion of the* ^fot ser' y that has\ntaken pla le in the last year. \"Every-thing see fn s to Jjai\u00a3sJ\u00bbpp\u20ac^d't fr' once,\" sai*d Ms Fox. \"We've had an\nexpansion in the facilities occurring\nat the same time as new buildings\nhave come into use.\"\nIn addition to these changes,\nFelix has learned that there have\nbeen changes to procedures in the\nNursery and some staff believe that\nmatters have been brought to a head by a combination of events,\ndo have af very strong community.\"\nChristmas Caper Success\nThis year's Christmas Caper took\nplace in the College last Sunday\nand Joe McFadden went along to\nfind out more. The Caper was\norganised by the HUB Office and\naimed to introduce children to the\nfun and excitement that science and\ntechnology can offer.\nCraft stalls, science demonstrations and games took place in\nthe Sherfield Ante-Room and Main\nDining Hall. There was also a 'Science Shop' held in the Senior\nCommon Room.\nDemonstrations and hands-on\nexperiments were run by Imperial\nCollege staff and students. There\nwas also a show by Science\nMuseum staff based on the popular\n'Launch Pad' format.\nChildren had the chance to see a cat's eye view of the world, learn\nabout human hearing and the\nphysics of music, have fun with\nbubbles and watch an explosive\ndemonstration by the Chemistry\ndepartment. Other activities\nincluded face-painting, 'Reindeer\nRacing' and making Christmas\ndecorations. Volunteers from\nImperial College's tutoring scheme,\nthe Pimlico Connection acted as\nguides for everyone coming to the\nCaper. These and other students\nTake four hundred and fifty children and two hundred adults.\nMix with various craft stalls and science experiments and\nstir the whole concoction for three hours.\nDoes this sound like a recipe for a nervous breakdown?\nfrom the College also helped run\nsome of the stalls. Those who went\nalong included families of College\nstaff and children from local\nschools.\nThe HUB Office would like to\nthank everyone who helped on the\nday or provided materials for any\nof the activities.\nJtiospital\nClosure?\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nAND ANDREW TSENG\nThe fate of Charing Cross and\nHammersmith Hospitals could be\ndecided by Christmas following\nincreased speculation this week.\nIt has been rumoured that\nVirginia Bottomley, Health Secretary, will announce the merger of\nboth hospitals and the closure of\nthe Hammersmith Hospital before\nthe end of the winter festivities. It\nwould mark the reshaping of\nLondon's health services.\nShould an announcement be\nmade, it is expected that Hammersmith Hospital will be closed. Staff\nand services would then be moved\nto Charing Cross. This would\nbecome a specialist hospital\nproviding cancer treatment and\nother services for West London.\nThe Royal Marsden and St Bartholomews are also under threat, with\npredicted losses of at least 1,000\nbeds. It has also been suggested\nthat the Royal Marsden will be\nrelocated to Surrey.\nHowever, any relocation could\njeo pardi se the 'Chelsea Medical\nSciences Centre'. The centre was\nproposed by Ms Bottomley in her\nreply to a report on London\nmedicine by Sir Bernard Tomlinson\nlast year. It would federally link\nvarious West London medical\ncentres, including the Royal\nMarsden and Imperial College.\nOther institutions that would\nform part of the centre are the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute,\nthe Institute of Cancer Research\nand the Royal Postgraduate\nMedical School. These institutions\nmay be the subject of mergers with\nImperial College {Felix 982),\nforming a possible 'Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine'.\nThe deadline for articles for the Christmas Special is 6pm today\n\n"

    "content": "12 Reviews\nLook Closely Now . . .\nWithin the hallowed halls of the Royal\nAcademy, above the seething mass of the\nAmerican Art show is an exhibition in miniature.\nIt is not a collection of paintings, but the\ndrawings which preceded them. The collection\nhas been lent by the J. Paul Getty museum,\nwhich houses a collection of paintings by the\ngrand masters on the sunny island of Malibu.\nBasking in the afternoon heat, the curator\ndecided to make a collection of drawings, which\nhas grown to be one of the most valuable and\ninteresting collections of such items anywhere.\nSome 120 of these are being shown at the Royal\nAcademy - quite a privilege since, in the Jean\nPaul Getty museum, no more than thirty are\nshown at any one time.\nThe drawings date back as late as the 1500s and many of them are exceedingly fragile, being\nlittle more than sketches on scrap paper. Others,\nhowever, are executed with such a mastery of\ntechnique that they could be finished works in\ntheir own right. Often these are simply\npreliminary sketches for oil paintings.\nWhen looking at these, the first thing you\nnotice is how incredibly well the artists could\ndraw in those days. Having been force fed on a steady diet of modern art with its unruly daubs\nand pretensions, it is refreshing to see something\nthat really could be described as fine art.\nPaintings by artists such as these are often\noverlooked because they have been reproduced\nso many times, but the drawings beg you to look\nclosely and admire the real skill involved.\nAmongst many relatively unknown artists are\nsome gems by recognisable names: a tiny picture\nof a child with a lamb by Da Vinci and a delicate\nsketch by Rafael stand out in the renaissance\nsection. Rubens' sketch of a Korean man is\nunusual, not least because of the mystery of how\na16 th century Flemish painter could have met a Korean years before there were any links\nbetween the two worlds. The star of the show is\ncommonly acknowledged to be a near perfect\nwatercolour of a stag beetle by Durer, but many\nof the lesser known pictures are far more\ninteresting.\nReligious images abound, with a variety of\npictures showing God within his billowing\nclouds, and an element of humour is often\npresent. In one picture, for instance, a collection\nof peasants bow down before God whilst a couple of children take a piss unnoticed in the\nforeground. Many of the drawings are almost\ncaricatures, with the features exaggerated to\nmake them more amusing. A personal favourite\nwas a little detail of a peasant couple dancing.\nIn all, this is a surprisingly interesting and\nrefreshing exhibition, with work by artists\ngreater than any you could find today. Their\ntechnique was impeccable, their discipline\nICU Bookstore\n* CORONATION ST.%\nMERCHANDISE\nNOW AVAILABLE\nLighters, Bottle Openers,\nMugs, Playing Cards,\nand loads more all with\nthe logo from your\nfavourite program...\nDon't forget Xmas\nCard and other gift\nlines at superb prices\nij^STILL IN STOCK\nKorean Man by Peter Paul Rubens\nunknown by modern standards - a perfect\nantidote to the freedom that is destroying\nmodern art.

    "content": "18 Opinion\nEditorial\nPaper\nThe student newspapers within Imperial College\nseem to be coming under attack at the moment.\nAs well as the petition going round complaining\nabout Felix, Pit is being criticised for not having\nenough naked women for the RSM's liking and\nBroadsheet is s lagging off Guildsheet.\nWith the editors of each publication changing\nevery year, the style and content is bound to\nchange. But people will insist on comparing\neverything to years gone by. Things do change\nand people have to accept that. If the Pit editors\ndon't want the pages of Pit adorned with scantily\nclad females this year, that's their decision. The\nsame goes for the other editors. If they want to\ndo things differently, that's up the them, they are\nthe editors. That's what 'editor' means - the\nperson in overall charge of the newspaper.\nIf people are unhappy about the content, then\nshould do something about it. They should air\ntheir grievances, not to their mates, but to the\npeople concerned. It's no good complaining if\nthe people able to change things don't know\nwhat to change. I mentioned earlier about the\npetition that is currently circulating regarding\nthe quality of Felix this year. None of the people\nwho I understand to be involved have come to\nsee me. If they, or anyone else has comments or\ncomplaints, please come and tell me. It isn't difficult to find me - I tend to spend a large\nproportion of my time in the Felix Office (next\nto the Union Lounge in the Union Building). I am perfectly willing to talk to anyone about\nFelix. If you don't feel able to come in and talk\nto me, then you can always write me a letter. It\nwon't get ignored and I will take on board any\nsuggestions you may have.\nTo be perfectly honest, I'm not totally happy\nwith the way that Felix has been this term, but\nthere are a number of reasons for it. Owain\nmentions some of them briefly in his reply to\none of the letters on the opposite page. I feel that\nit is important for clubs and societies to be able\nto publicise themselves to the student population\nand as a result, a large part of each issue is\ndevoted to them. A common complaint is that\nthere are too many reviews. If you actually look,\nthere is, on average, one page per review type\n(such as cinema, books, theatre) and I think that\nit is a useful section.\nI am trying to produce a Felix in which there\nis something for everybody. I don't expect\neveryone to like all of it, because that just isn't realistic. I am aware that there has been a lack of\nvariety this term and a few people have already\ngiven me suggestions for changes that could be\nmade. Next term will see a lot more features and\nquite probably some sort of opinion column. I need people to not only write the articles, but\nalso people to suggest the ideas. So, if you have\nany, please let us know.\nDon't Forget\nAnyway, rant over with and on to other things. It\nappears that there is aUG M today. In case you\nhaven't seen the posters or you missed the\ncaptions on the front cover, it's in the Ents\nLounge on the ground floor of the Union\nBuilding at l pm. There don't appear to be any\ninteresting motions for this one; in fact there\ndon't appear to be any motions at all. But go\nalong anyway. It'll give you a chance to ask the\nSabbaticals (and any of the other Union officers)\nwhat they've been up to this term and what\nthey've done for you. They are there to represent\nyou and put forward your views to people both\ninside and outside the College. There are reports\nelsewhere in this issue from the Union Office\nSabbaticals which tell you a bit about what\nthey've done, but go along and quiz them about\nthem - how much do you really know about their\nactivities?\nPlug\nThe production of the Felix Christmas Special is\nnow under way. It will be a larger than normal\nissue and it will hit the departments on the last\nday of term.\nCredits\nPrinter: News: Puzzles: Last, but not least:\nAndy Thompson Andrew Tseng (Ed) Catfish Penguin\nShaun Joynson Sphinx Charlie Ixary\nTypesetter: Joe McFadden\nRose Atkins Lynn Bravey Photography: Collators last week:\nMichael Ingram Ivan Chan Ivan Chan\nBusiness Manager: The Hub Office Owain Bennallack\nSimon Govier Features: Jon Jordan\nOwain Bennallack (Ed) Xmas Decorations: Simon Shaw\nAdvertising Manager: Kristine J Vaaler Simon Shaw Joe McFadden\nSteve Newhouse Rachel Mountford Penguin Penguin\nOwain Bennallack Michael Ingram\nReviews: Layout & Proofing: Joe McFadden\nJuliette Decock (Books) Kin Wei Lee Michael Ingram\nRekha Nayak (Theatre) Patrick Wood Melissa Parcell\nJon Jordan (Music) Michael Ingram Ivan Chan\nMarcus Alexander (Arts) Mylan Lester Jon Jordan\nSMALL ADS\nChristmas Carol Party - video, AV, mince\npies, mulled wine, plus surprise guest.

    "content": "16 Reviews\nYo La Tengo\nShaker\nYo La Tengo recently released one of the year's best albums in 'Painless' (remember Tintin's10) and now the generous souls have decided to\ncontinue their spate of activity by releasing this\nsingle which contains two songs unavailable\nelsewhere.\n'Shaker' discards any of their trademark late\nnight atmospheric s and goes for a dark\nmenacing drone, aching for a release which\nnever comes. 'For Shame Of Doing Wrong'\ntreads familiar territory in being a warm,\nembracing wash of organ and MBV-esque\nvocals. Downsides? It's not long enough...\nRidley Dash\nReleased on Matador\nJPS\nExperience\nBleeding Star\nWell, this is a surprise - a band from New\nZealand who aren't Crowded House! What's more, they're actually rather good.\nThey know how to plunder effectively. 'Ray\nof Shine' nicks a Johnny Marr guitar line and\namazingly comes off all the better for it. The\nbest track here though is 'Spaceman', where\nthey kick up one heck of a fuzz and still manage\nto pull out a great Pop hook. The only lazy\ncomparison I can think of is The Jesus & Mary\nChain jamming with MB V,( not again, Ed) but\nthis doesn't go half way towards describing the\nambient intensity this band possess.\nOccasionally they lose the plot and the tracks\ndo tend to merge into one towards the end.\nNevertheless, the subtle mix of light and shade\nensures that there are enough highlights to\nsatisfy, making this a worthy debut album. (7)\nVik\nReleased on Flying Nun Records\nNirvana\nAll Apologies/Rape Me\nHearing 'All Apologies' taken from the recent\n'In Utero' album is like reading Revelation\nwithout the books before. It can stand alone -after all, it ju icily wetted our appetites when\nserved up at their sham boli c set at Reading '92.\nJayhawks\nBorderline\nLabelled simply, the Jayhawks are proud\npurveyors of 'country rock'. Proud and\nconfident on stage, Mark Olson, the lead\nvocalist, smiles a lot. A big rubbery grin which\nplays across a face reminiscent of a young\nElvish Brando. He smiles because he's happy\nand he's happy for the Jayhawks are playing.\nThey played a set trading everything from\ntheir acclaimed 'Hollywood Town Hall' album,\nallowing a jamming fluidity not always\ndisplayed in their plastic ally circular work.\nSometimes this awakened dull o us songs like\n'Two Angels' but of more danger was the\ndissipation of the excellent 'Sister Cry'. A track\nworthy of the Black Crowes ended up more akin\nto the Grateful Dead on bad acid. Boo.\nTintin\n\u2022 Ml The Jayhawks- country rock ster s out to subvert the nation - Mark Olson (far left) with rubbery smile\nIMMtiMM\nS.F. Seals\nBaseball Trilogy\nBarbara Manning of SF Seals is something of an\nunderground star in the US and, it would seem,\na huge baseball fan. This provides the evidence:\nthe band is named after a now defunct San\nFrancisco team and the three songs here salute\nthree players. 'Dock Ellis', the only SF Seals\noriginal, is a fairly ordinary sounding American\nindie song which would be entirely unremarkable were it not for the most exhilarating guitar\nriff of the year so far.\nThe best song, however, is 'Joltin' Joe\nDiMaggio', a swing jazz number of delightful\ntoe-tapping simplicity. It's fun, it's groovy, it's fab! I defy you to find another single which\ndisplays this much diversity or this much\nknowledge of baseball. Fantastic.\nGuy\nReleased on Matador\nH.P. Zinker\nStaying Loose\nUh-ah, I thought, another three-piece guitar\nband doubtless peddling the same clapped out\nfare. 'Reason', the opening track, almost made\nme change my mind in one go.

These noble souls\nwere going collecting on a Rag Raid in aid of\nOxfam. Once we had finally left London, after\nvarious stops to do bizarre things like phone\nRadio 1 in the pouring rain (why can't they\ninstall mobile phones in the minibuses?), we\nmotored off down the M23 and eventually\narrived at our destination no thanks to Tim the\nNavigator (\"it was a short cut honest\").\nWe proceeded to collect lots of money,\ndespite the rainy and windy conditions. Once all\nlight had gone and we could collect no more, we\nheaded off to the nearest town (which happened\nto be Brighton) in search of some food.\nThe bright lights beckoned and drew us\nfatally towards that money eater, better known\nas the Pier. What could we do but enter and we\nall came out with far lighter pockets than we\nentered with, other than our Treasurer who\nseemed to have had a lucky streak and managed\nto come out with more than she entered with.\n(Perhaps we should let her double our total in a similar way )\nOn the way back to the Metropolis, we\nencountered many bizarre things such as\nstrawberry yoghurt and electronic vibrating\npenguins. But anyway, many thanks to all who\ncame and raised \u00a3300 for Oxfam and had an\nexcellent day out.\nThis Saturday the Raggies will be venturing\nFollowing on from last week's hint at the films\nshowing at ICU Cinema, we continue this week\nwith the rest of the line-up. Thursday 17th December brings the latest offering from the\ndepraved mind of Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir\nDogs, to be screened in January '94).\nNewlyweds Christian Slater and Patricia\nArquette go on the run - with police and\ngangsters on their tail. It's a relationship that\nbegins with a bang (pardon the expression) after\nwhich matters become gradually, though\nliterally, explosive. To find out more about this\n'Thelma and Louise meets Reservoir Dogs',\ncome along to True Romance (18).\nAlso showing during the last week of term is\nthe latest Tom Cruise offering. The Firm (15)\nsees Cruise joining an exclusive law practice\nwith Mob connections and soon finds his dream\njob turning into a nightmare. Also starring Gene\nHackman, Holly Hunter and Ed Harris.\nIn a totally different vein, we see Stallone\nhanging on for dear life in Cliffhanger (15). This\nfilm really must be seen on the giant FilmSoc\nscreen to be appreciated since it is presented in\nwall to wall, floor to ceiling Cinemascope.\nSince everyone, on the last day of term, will\nbe feeling rather miserable about the prospect of\nhaving to be with the family over the festive\nperiod and having to control their drinking to\nsome extent, FilmSoc have decided to screen a classic piece of comedy. We all grinned at the\nparrot sketch, we all revelled in the humour of\nBicycle Repair Man, we fell about as if very\ndrunk at the thought of those silly walks. For all\nreptile lovers, FilmSoc has never been more\nproud to present the film Monty Python's Life Of\nBrian (15).

    "content": "II Feature\nEquality Now, The Case For Change\nIn 1991,244 men were prosecuted for\nhaving consensual sex with partners\naged between 16 and 21.\n184 were found guilty and 14 were jailed,\nsome for as long as seven years. Their crime?\nHomosexuality. None of them would even have\nbeen arrested if their partner had been a woman.\nThe chance to end this discrimination is\nexpected to come this Parliamentary session, if\namendments can be inserted into the\nGovernment's Criminal Justice Bill, announced\nin the Queen's Speech last month and expected\nto be published shortly.\nActing on the proposals of the Wolfenden\nReport of 1957, Parliament semi-legal is ed homosexuality with the Sexual Offenses Act\n1967. It stated that a homosexual act between\ntwo (and not more than two) men in private, was\nnot an offense \"provided that all parties consent\nthereto and have attained the age of 21 years\".\nThe price of this reform was what is now the\nhighest age of consent for gay men in Europe.\nIn 1967 although the justification for 21 was\nvery weak, it was accepted as a political com-promise. Two further reports to Parliament have\nboth recommended lowering the age of consent\nyet still there has been no change. What\narguments have been advanced to cause this and\nhow valid are they today?\n1. Homosexuality Is A Sickness.\nIn fact the Wolfenden Report rejected\nsuggestions that homosexuality was a sickness\nand this year the World Health Organisation\nofficially \"declassified homosexuality as a disease\".\n2. Young Men Are Still Confused About Their\nSexuality.\nTo quote the Wolfenden Report: \"We have\ngiven special attention to the evidence on a recognisable age in the fixation of young men's sexual patterns...Our medical witnesses were\nunanimously of a view that the main sexual\npattern is laid down in the early years of life and\nthe majority of them held that it was usually\nfixed in main outline by the age of sixteen.\"\n3. Homosexuality Is Undesirable And Young\nMen Need Special Protection.\nWolfenden, again, succinctly challenges this\nargument: \"We recognise the need for protecting\nthe young and immature. But this argument can\nbe carried too far; there comes a time when a young man can properly be expected to stand on\nhis own feet...and we find it hard to believe he\nneeds to be protected from would-be seducers\nmore carefully than a girl does.\"\n4. Homosexuals Will Seduce Young Men.\nThis is the official justification for having a different age of consent for gay men. Surely\nunwelcome sexual advances serious enough to\nwarrant criminal prosecution are equally offensive whether the victim is a man or a woman and\nthe same law can apply to both.\nA more worrying side to the campaign to lower\nthe age of consent is the effect of failure to\nsecure a change in the law. At the moment, the\npolice are turning a blind eye and the\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner stated that\nenforcing the law \"was not an operational\npriority\". If Parliament decides against change,\n\"it would be a clear signal to make enforcement\na priority\". The result of this would be increased\nfear of prosecution in gay men under 21, deterring them from seeking safer sex advice or from\nreporting 'queer-bashing' incidents.\nThe time has come to end the discrimination.\nJoin the fight for equality now by writing to your\nMP and urging him to attend the debate on an\nequal age of consent and support the motion.\nRachel Mountford\n'The Case For Change' is available free from\nStonewall, 2 Greycoat Place, Westminster,\nSW1P1SB.

    "content": "Feature ft\nconvinced that refusal is nothing but teasing.\nHowever, nowadays women are free to have sex\nif they want to and there is less reason than ever\nthat they should say no if they wouldn't mean it.\nWhen women say no, they mean no.\nOf course, the question has arisen as to what\nextent consent needs to be expressed. (On some\nAmerican campuses it is possible to acquire a document with the help of which a written\nconsent can be settled. Is that what you would\nlike your sexual relationships to be based on in\nfuture?)\nThat a woman might\nsleep around or lead a man on does not make a rape a lesser offence.\nParticularly worrying was the media frenzy\nwhich met the King's College case, linking this\nwith student excesses in general. Some statements that were made implied that, after an act\nhas reached a 'certain' stage, the woman cannot\nexpect the man to stop.\nAfter the acquittal, Lord Russel, the alleged\nrapist's personal tutor, claimed that in certain\n'mitigating circumstances' a rape could be less\nof an offence, if not entirely excusable. The\napproach of the media to appalling comments\nsuch as these has been lacklustre to say the least.\nEverybody at the Imperial College discussion\nmeeting agreed that college members should not\nissue any personal comments in the media.\nAccording to a survey conducted by the\nLondon Student newspaper, an appallingly low\nnumber of \"75 per cent of both male and female\ninterviewees believed that if a woman expresses\nlack of consent once penetration has occurred,\nand if the man persists, that it still constitutes\nrape\".\nJohn Hassard believes: \" No amount of\nmisinterpretation or confused body language can\never justify an assault.\" Furthermore, that a woman might sleep around or lead a man on (the\nKing's College woman was 'accused' of doing\nboth) does not make rape a lesser offence. That\nwould be on the same line as classifying sexual\nabuse as a 'professional risk' for a prostitute,\nlegit imi sing its occurrence.\nOf course, the sleeping around of a man\ndoesn't justify castration either. I mention\ncastration on purpose. Some men seem to have\ndifficulties in understanding the threat a rape\nposes to a woman. I'm sure every man fears\ncastration, and a person submitted to such an\nexperience would undergo a personality change\ncaused by a trauma from which it may be\nimpossible to recover - that should give some\nidea about the detrimental effects of rape.\nAfter all, there have been cases where men\nhave been raped (by men - in case you didn't realise). Imagine this happening to you, and you\nwill understand the concern women experience\nwhen confronted with this topic.\nA further point of discussion was the services\nthat should be available to victims of assault\nwithin college. It was decided that posters\nshould be designed which would provide\nrelevant telephone numbers and advice, and to\nhang these up in both the ladies' toilets in the\nUnion and also in the Halls. Furthermore, a leaflet should be produced containing\ninformation and advice.\nApparently, there now is always at least one\nfemale Security Officer on duty. However, most\nvictims will want as few people involved as\npossible. Remember that it is your right to call\nthe police without any regard to College\nprocedure.\nMany victims feel reluctant to report their\ncase to the police. Most just want to put the\nassault behind them as quickly as possible and\nmany fear embarrassment and intimidation.\nHowever, reporting should be seriously\nconsidered as it might prevent further offences.\nIf you decide to report, then do it as soon as\npossible (the police term this an 'early\ncomplaint'). Try to resist the urge to wash or\nchange clothes as this could destroy vital\nevidence which might forensic ally convict the\nperpetrator. Even though this sounds very\nclinical - try to remember as many details as\npossible, and how you could describe your\nattacker if you don't know his name. Although\nshock is inevitable, tranquillisers and alcohol\nmay both have a negative influence on the\nclarity of your account.\nIf you wish, you can demand to be examined\nby your own GP. If you are registered with the\nCollege Health Centre you might want to ask for\nDr Irene Weinreb who is well-known for her\ninterest in women's affairs. Any counselling\nneeded will be provided by College; it was also\nstressed at the meeting that the perpetrator\nshould receive counselling.\nFor many students, coming to college offers\nthe opportunity to indulge in large quantities of\nbooze without any restrictions by parents etc.\nOften enough, people are even press uri sed by\ntheir peers to consume excessive amounts. You\ncan drink as much as you want. However,\ndrunkenness is not accepted as an excuse for\nanything. And women surely are aware that the\neffects of alcohol are well integrated in many\nconquering strategies which can lead to\ninvolvements you would never think of when\nsober.\nNowadays women are\nfree to have sex if they\nwant to...\nHowever, if two of you wish to sleep\ntogether, I can only tell you that somebody who\nrefuses to use a condom is not worth shagging\nanyway. You can get free condoms at the Health\nCentre (ask for a condom slip) and for more\nurgent cases there are various dispensing\nmachines within the Union and Halls.\nThe author would like to thank Minever\nKavlak, John Hassard, Nicky Fox and also Phill\nHenry, David Spooner and Owain Bennallack.\nSex?\nNo, this isn't Cosmopolitan,\nyou will not be\ninstructed on\ninteresting sexual\npositions and fear not, Felix hasn't gone all sleazy!\nRather, this\narticle concerns\nthe subtle\nre-mapping of\nthe sexual\nlandscape...\nKristine J Waaler,\nthe ICU Womeny\ns Officer, reports.\nThe ICU Women's Officer can be contacted via the Union Office\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 13\nJamais Vu\n(A one-man show by Ken Campbell)\nBrilliant. Absolutely brilliant. This is without\ndoubt the best show I have seen in the course of\nreviewing plays for Felix. It won the Evening\nStandard award for best drama last week (the\naward statue is actually brought on stage as part\nof the proceedings) and it's obvious why.\nForget the fact it's in a theatre which is small\nenough to make the evening feel more like a night out in a comedy club with a single two and\na half hour act. It is a measure of Ken Campbell's skill that he can keep the audience\nlaughing for the full time without it becoming\nboring. What's more, this isn't the usually polite\nlaughter you normally hear in theatres when a particularly witty reference to the tempo of\nIbsen's subtext in his seminal, but unpublished\nwork is made - this is people actually enjoying\nthemselves, actually crying with laughter.\nThe show is about Ken's quest to find out\nabout a tribe in the South Pacific who worship\nthe Duke of Edinburgh and who speak pidgin\nEnglish. He is sent on this quest by a resident of\na mental disorders secure unit who has some\ninteresting theories on TV detector vans, John\nBirt and cycle clips. Sink plungers are integral to\nthe plot, so much so that, at one point, Ken has\nsix held on by suction to his 'fol lica ly challenged' head (see picture).\nThe programme at 80p is worth buying if you\nare interested in pidgin English. It offers such\ngems as 'Puk-p uk he rau sim belli belong pi k!'( The crocodile is disembowelling the pig!) and\n'Hed belong him he stink finish, Daphne' (He\nhas been dead for a long time, Daphne). It would\nspoil it to tell you any more so go and see it.\n(By the way, and I don't normally do this,\navoid the Indian restaurant The Grand Indian 2\non Villiers Street like the plague. I had the\nmisfortune to have a post-performance meal\nthere and it is was the worst meal I have ever\nhad - everything was either lukewarm or tasted\nof Fairy liquid.

Ends 24th Dec.\nKen Campbell with just one sink plunger\ntastefully attached to his head!\nThe Clearing\n\"It's a terrible world to be adrift in.\" Helen\nEdmundson's The Clearing follows the gradual\n'setting adrift' of Irish families and royalists\nfrom their homes by the Cromwell government\nin the 1650s, following the defeat of Charles I. Our heroine is Maddy (excellently played by\nSusan Lynch) who is presented as the very\nessence of Irish beauty - full of caprice, yet\nsensuous and mystical. She entrances her\nhusband Robert (Adrian Rawlins) who is\nforever the upright English gentleman (or at\nleast aspires to be).\nInitially, the political problems, inherent in\nthis mixed marriage, are no problem at all; the\nbaby can be baptised as a Protestant rather than\nCatholic because Maddy optimistically believes\nthat 'your God is as good as mine'. However, as\nshe begins to fight the deportation of her\nfriends, Robert ever more insidiously clam ours to keep his wife, son and home, or at least his\nson and his home, or at the very least his home.\nThe issue then is one of contradicting\nloyalties. Robert is forever trying to 'keep\nafloat', just like Thomas More in A Man For All\nSeasons, a play to whose mood and style The\nClearing owes a lot. Particularly carefully\nstudied are the observations made of the\nrelationships between the characters. For\nexample Solomon, a family friend who fought\nfor the King, explains his differences with\nCromwell thus: \"I 've fought with men and tried\nto kill them... but I haven't hated them.\" Never\nmind the plastic baby; if the use of Tavener's The Protecting Veil as scene-change music -yes, scene-change music - makes you want to\nscream, if it's not quite as gripping or intense as\nyou want it to be, it's refreshing to see a modern\nplay which doesn't have you grappling with\nsubtext and obscure metaphors. It's a great set,\ntoo. See it.\n\"They're wet creatures the Irish...full of tears\nand rain\". This marriage is described elsewhere\nas 'an illusory clearing in a nightmare forest',\nbut Robert's effort to avoid sinking by\nswimming with the flow (irrespective, ultimately, of whoever else drowns) reminds me of\nthe following anecdote: Jimi Hendrix and\nJoseph Stalin were setting out on their well-known journey across Africa, on a path\nnotorious for lion attacks. Jimi noticed that his\ncompanion was sporting a brand new pair of\ntrainers. \"Hey Joe,\" he said, \"where you going\nwith those trainers on your feet? Do you think\nyou could outrun a lion?\". \"No,\" replied the\nRussian dictator, \"I just have to outrun you.\".\nMike Servant\nBush Theatre, Shepherd Bush Green, W12. 081\n743 3388. Tube: Shepherds Bush. Membership\n50p. Cones: \u00a36 cones. Ends 23rd December.\nThe Iron Man\nIn terms of writing rock operas, Pete\nTownshend has got a pretty good CV: Tommy\nand Quadrophenia were two of the best of their\nkind. Ted Hughes' fairy tale book is also a rarity\nin that an adult can enjoy it every bit as much as\na child. So a combination of the two should be\nsomething to sav our. However, instead of\ncharming prose and powerful anthems, we get a more muddied, meandering version of a simple\nstory. For some reason, Hughes' original words\nhave been discarded in favour of a general\ntheme of eco-friendly self-belief that tends to\nthe banal and is far from new or refreshing.\nThe young cast is led by the excellent\nAnthony Barclay as the boy Hogarth. He\nbefriends the Iron Man and persuades him to\nsave the world from the evil Star-spirit.\nBarclay's performance shows boundless energy\nand accomplished singing.

The main subject\ndiscussed was the King's College alleged rape\ncase and the consequences and implications this\nand similar cases might have on subsequent\nallegations of sexual abuse. The meaning was to\nestablish some guidelines for staff confronted\nwith a problem of this kind.\nA short summary of the King's College case:\nA female student of the named college accused a fellow final-year student of rape. However, she\nwas not prepared to go to the police, but\npreferred the case to be dealt with by college\nprocedures, demanding that the man had to leave\nthe college. The man denied the accusations but\n[nonetheless was asked to plead guilty to an*\nunspecified lesser charge, apologise to the\nwoman and leave the university. Subsequently,\nthe accused student decided to call in the police\nand take his chances with a jury, rejecting what\nseems to be a plea-bargain. During the trial, it\nbecame clear that the alleged rapist had been a close friend and trusted confidant of the woman,\nand described by her as \"sweet\" but \"sexually\nrepellent\". Apparently they had, on several\noccasions before, kissed 'passionately', but the\nwoman stated that this was as far as she ever\nwanted to go.\nThe man claimed that she didn't object to any\nof their sexual activities that night until the early\nmorning when she fled to the corridor in\ndistress. The woman stated that she had little\nrecollection of what happened that night,\npresumably due to excessive drinking, until the\nmoment when she felt somebody attempting to\nhave sex with her, escaping subsequently.\n\"No amount of\nmisinterpretation or\nconfused body\nlanguage can ever\njustify an assault.\"\nShe insisted that she would never have given\nher consent, saying: \"I did not consent because I could not.\"\nFollowing the scrutiny of the characters and\nformer affairs of both, the man was acquitted by\na jury consisting mostly of women.\nThe subject, however, is not to discuss the\njustice of the court's decision and it is not my\nintention to stir up a surge of letters about the\ncase. The problem is much more; this and other\nrecent rape allegations which resulted in\nacquittal, whether justified or not, might make it\neven harder for rape victims to come forward.\nSo far, most cases of sexual abuse are not\nreported to the police, let alone brought to trial,\nand it is unlikely that the ratio will improve\nfollowing these acquittals. The public might also\ninfer that a large proportion of rape allegations\nare not genuine, and some men might believe\nthat they can go free when committing rape. But\nrape is a violent act and needs to be treated\nseriously by authorities.\nThe handling of the case by King's College\nhas received a lot of criticism. It seemed that the\ncollege attempted to cover up the incident to\n_save its reputation, trying to deal with an\nallegation of rape via an internal tribunal. If you\ndon't grasp the absurdity of such an attempt,\nthen imagine a college that intended to deal with\nmurder by a disciplinary procedure.\nThe members of Imperial College present at\nthe meeting agreed that any allegation of rape\nshould be reported to the police if the victim\nwishes the perpetrator to be penal is ed. The\nCollege should not attempt to deal with such a serious criminal offence by internal procedures\nbut should recognise that this kind of incident\ndoes not fall within its jurisdiction. Also, the\nhandling of rape allegations by disciplinary\nprocedure could be open to abuse.\nJohn Hassard, Warden of Selkirk and Tizard\nHalls and chair of the meeting, stated: \"Again,\nwithout reference to the King's case, it is\npossible to imagine scenarios in which a woman\nmight wish to exaggerate a man's actions if she\nknew it would not come to the police's attention,\nand whatever forensic evidence might be forth-coming, or to court. If she knew there would be\nautomatic police involvement, she might be\ninhibited - for fear of being found out, or for fear\nfor the man's future. Even easier is to imagine\ncircumstances in which a man might rape if he\nthought there was little likelihood of police\ninvolvement.\"\nThe guidelines which are being prepared will\nalso contain a statement which affirms that a person has the right to refuse or stop any sexual\nact she or he might feel uncomfortable with,\nwhatever the stage of involvement. Since it is\nbelieved that a vast number of students have\ntheir first serious sexual experience during their\ntime at college, such an affirmation is more than\nrelevant.\nOne of the reasons that the alleged rapist in\nthe King's College case was acquitted is\npresumably that the woman never expressed a lack of consent; according to her she simply\nwasn't able to. Frequently, 'silent' consent is\nassumed as long as lack of consent is not\nverbally expressed. And even then some men are\nFree condoms are available from the Health Centre\n\n"

A comedy starring\nRobin Williams who has been limited to seeing\nhis children only on Saturdays. When his\nestranged wife (Sally Field) advertises for a housekeeper, his desperation to be with his\nfamily prompts him to disguise himself as an\nelderly Scottish woman and he gets the job.\nTokyo Story\nAn elderly couple living by the sea visit their\ngrown up children in Tokyo, but find they do\nnot fit in. Their children have become selfish\nand mean, negatively affected by city living.\nThe grandparents are only treated nicely by their\nwidowed daughter-in-law who, despite having\nto live in poverty, has retained traditional\nvalues. The grandparents eventually return\nhome and the grandmother dies, leaving the\ngrandfather to face the future alone.\nDirector: Peter Greenaway\nStarring: Julia Ormond, Ralph Fiennes, Philip\nStone, Jonathan Lacey\nPeter Greenaway is, without doubt, a difficult\nfilm creator. His adeptness at a particular\ntechnique for film-making does not make up for\nthe fact that The Baby of Macon, his latest\noffering, is a very hard film to watch.\nGreenaway's films aren't 'real'. The fine-ness, the gilt, the almost stilted acting, are\nbaroque and formal. But it would be incorrect to\nlabel Greenaway as purely an art director. The\nBaby of Macon is art which reflects life closely -too closely for comfort.\nIt's set in the 16th century and narrates the\nstory of the birth of the Baby to an old woman.\nThe Baby is soon adopted by his sister who\nclaims a virgin birth. He is held up as a miracle\nchild and is exploited by the sister and later by\nthe church.\nThis story is acted out as a 'play with music'\nwithin the film. And the film, of course, is a play\nto us, the audience. These layers are a striking\ntechnique, bringing us much closer to the film.\nBut within these layers of the plays threads 'real\nlife'. For instance, the play has a scene involving\nthe goring of the Priest's son and another\ninvolving the gang rape of the Baby's sister.\nThese are in a play, but the actors actually do\nmurder and rape. It's disturbing and surreal\nLittle Dreams\nThis Egyptian film is about the effects of war on\ncivilians. It is set in Nasser's period and is seen\nthrough the eyes of a young boy. A close look at\nhuman relationships is a strong feature of this\nfilm - in particular the relationship between the\nboy and his widowed mother. The characters are\nimpressive and the scene is well drawn.\nThe film has an award from the Birmingham\nThis rather unusual movie has little interest in\nstory-telling or conventional narrative tech-ni ques. It's essentially about the unpredictability\nand transience of human desire and the film\nportrays this in the story of four drifters.\nNick (Tim Roth) broke up with Carol\n(Phoebe Cates) and now goes out with her best\nfriend Beth (Bridget Fonda). He decides that he\nand Beth should move to Nowheresville, where\nthey might be happier. He leaves a day early,\nphoning Carol, telling her that he needs to be on\nhis own. When Nick returns two days later,\nwatching both scenes: the audience of the play\nadmire the life-like acting, not really realising\nhow real it actually is.\nCentral to the whole film is the evil of\nexploitation: the Baby's sister exploits him, the\nChurch exploits the Baby, the Priest's son\nexploits the sister and, in a bizarre inter-layer\nexploitation, the Prince (who is watching the\nplay) exploits his royal status and condemns the\nsister to her horrifying and real rape death.\nThis exploitation theme is served to us in its\ncomplete rawness. Greenaway's obsessions -grotesque ness, humiliation, nudity - are present\nthroughout the film and culminate in the two\npreviously mentioned and much criticised\nscenes. But what Greenaway serves is the real\nthing. Hollywood exploits our voyeurism, our\ns haden freude, but only Greenaway takes us to\nthe limit.\nGreenaway has defended The Baby of\nMacon's explicitness by saying that this is\nexperimental cinema. But excuses are not\nneeded. The Baby of Macon addresses some\nfundamental problems and, with its real-artificial\ndimensions - is a powerful, sophisticated and\nindeed difficult film.\nSamin Ishtiaq\nThe Baby Of Macon is showing at the National\nFilm Theatre, South Bank, SE1.

All four characters are forced to\nconsider what it is they are really after.\nThe movie is unpredictable and often quite\nfunny, as wills clash (the title is taken from\nNewton's first law). Performances are good and\nalthough the film is slow, it's never boring.\nBodies, Rest and Motion is different to the vast\nmajority of both mainstream and 'indie' fare in\nthat the story just doesn't go anywhere, but it's well worth a look if only to enjoy the trip.\n111 ill II ill HIIIMtMIIIIIIII 1,111,1,111,1\nBodies, Rest and Motion\nNext week's films from ICSF and FilmSoc are on pages 7 and 9\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion 19\nGrumble, Grumble, Grumble ..\nDear Felix,\nI read with a certain ironic sense of\namusement the letter from PIT in last week's magazine, wherein they blame the poor state of\naffairs of Felix on the lack of writers.\nAt the beginning of this term, I offered my\ntime, energy and enthusiasm as a writer for\nFelix. And not just as a writer, but as somebody\nwho had a desire to add a whole new dimension\nto the magazine -1 did not do this for myself, but\nbecause I wanted to enhance the lives of the\nstudents in College by bringing them subjects\nthey had no prior interest in.\nWithin a week, I had written two articles,\nwithin five weeks, I had written two more -1 had\nalso devoted a lot of time to organising the filing\nof information, telephoning art galleries,\narranging for invitations to press viewings, etc.\nAnd yet did these articles get printed? No, the\nweek after? No! The week after that? NO!! Every week it was the same. \"Sorry, but we\nhaven't got enough space\", \"Sorry, we've got a very limited number of pages\". Well, there may\nnot have been 'enough space', but there always\nseemed to be room enough to print two to three\npages of music reviews (I 've got nothing against\nmusic, but this isn't the NME. Surely other\nsubjects should be allowed some space as well),\nthere was always enough space to print reviews\nof children's books (the joke may be amusing\nonce, but more than once? A bizarre way to fill\nup pages in a college magazine.)\nInterminably tedious there was always\nenough space, even, to print full page reviews of\nclassical music. Now don't get me wrong here -I listen to far more classical music than popular\nmusic - but, in a college magazine such as Felix,\nsurely things should be printed with the\nreadership in mind. These reviews could only be\nunderstood by somebody who not only has a deep knowledge of the piece of music in\nquestion, but also knowledge of all the previous\nrecordings done of it. How many people like that\ncould be found at IC?\nWhenever I wrote something, foremost in my\nmind was always the fact that the readership, in\ngeneral had no prior knowledge or interest in the\nsubject. I worked hard to make them interesting,\namusing and lively so that anybody could\nappreciate them and gain something from them.\nIf I did not meet those objectives I felt that I was\nfailing in my job.\nAnd yet, nothing was printed. Eventually,\neight weeks into term and six weeks after I had\nsubmitted my first article, something was printed\n(even then, somehow, it was the wrong one - a draft version rather than the one I submitted for\npublication, but that's another story...). By\nwhich time, I just didn't care. OK, so one article\nwas printed, but would any others appear?\n\"We're still very short of space...\"\nI have reached the point now, where I have a choice. I could just give up entirely, and accept\nthat I have wasted a large amount of my time (at\na brief count, at least thirty hours), expense and\nenergy for nothing. Or I could carry on,\nstruggling against a failing system to produce\nreviews and articles which only appear when\nthey are already out of date...Should I bother?\nYours,\nMarcus Alexander, Mech Eng.\nP.S. Will this letter get printed? Or will it just be\nfiled away along with my other efforts?\nOw a in Bennallack, Features Editor, replies on behalf of Felix:\nShould you bother Marcus? Should anyone\nbother? You say you've spent at least thirty\nhours directed towards, Felix, fine, I 've spent\nat least two hours here every day since the\nterm began and I'm certainly not unique.\nHave you ever collated? I can't recall seeing\nyou swan ning about, deftly enlightening us\nPhilistines as we folded paper during any of\nthe Thursday nights I was here all night,\neight hours, until six am in the morning.\nYes, we all have our own agenda. I myself\nwould certainly produce a different\nnewspaper if I was editor. But understand\nthat Felix un't what anyone would like to see\nin it - it's the best attempt we can manage at\nwhat EVERYONE would like to see in it. I 've\nedited clubs and societies articles that\nneither I nor Felix received any thanks for\nrunning (people assume it's our job - is it the\nfunction of the boat club to take me for a spin\ndown the Thames some fine weekend?). Did\nanyone like or even read those articles?\nFollowing on from this, there are a certain number of pages to be filled and\ncertain criteria to be followed when deciding\nhow best to fill them. Did you know that\nnearly all advertising comes in the first term\nand has accounted for around four pages in\nevery issue? Felix, unfortunately perhaps,\nrequires this additional income. Did you\nrealise that clubs and societies clearly do\nmost of their recruiting during this term and\nthat may account for another five pages an\nissue? So there go ten pages, then you have\nthe cover, then the letters and editorial, and\nthen the news pages...\nIf you had asked, we could have explained\nthat next term things will change as these\nconstraints diminish. But no, you wrote your\nletter in your ivory garret, splendidly isolated\nand uninformed.\nYeah, I know about your article because I admired it and spent more than three hours\nproofing and editing it. Was it read? You\nadmit yourself that you are bringing IC\nstudents 'subjects they had no prior interest\nin'. Personally, I disagree. But I have no\nproblems with you holding your own\nopinions on Felix. How about having a conversation with us next time?\nMatt and the Musical Mishaps\nDear Editor,\nDue to musical differences, unfortunately\n'The Revolutionary Dub Warriors' who were\nscheduled to play at IC Union tonight, Friday\n10th December, will now no longer be doing so.\nBut do not fear, this means admission tonight is\nback to \u00a31 making that Christmas squeeze much\neasier.

    "content": "News 3\nFarewell\nChaplain\nBY JON JORDAN\nThe end of term sees the departure\nof one of College's chaplains, Bill\nRaines. Bill moves to take up a new\npost in Manchester, at the elegantly\ntitled parish of St James and the\nHoly Innocents, Birch with\nFallowfield, in the new year. Bill\nhas been based at Imperial College\nfor six years and, as such, is the\nlongest serving chaplain. Until\nrecently he was often found in\nclouds of cherry tobacco and also\ncounted kite flying and chess\namongst his more salubrious\nactivities.\nDespite being asked for a juicy\nnews bite, all the bearded cleric\ncould murmur was that \"IC is a great place to work, if you're a chaplain at least\". More interesting\nwas his view that Imperial College\nstudents didn't really think about\nscience and particularly science and\nreligion, because they had already\naccepted a certain view about it.\nFelix wish him and his family well\nin their new preferment.\nJohn Patten, one of Oxford's MPs,\nis met by unruly students\nProtests Against Patten\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nStudents throughout the country are\nin uproar at their apparent\nvictim is ation by John Patten\nSecretary of State for Education.\nPatten had to be rescued by\npolice on Monday when over 100\nstudents of Balliol College, Oxford\nsurrounded the Parish Hall in which\nhe was conducting an advice\nsurgery. The students were refused\nentry even though they had every\nright to attend.\nMr Patten used the incident to\nslur students and gain support for\nthe budget shift in student financing\nfrom grants to loans. Speaking in\nthe House of Commons he stated:\n\"The hall was completely\nsurrounded by yo bb ish students\nfrom Oxford University, who I am\nashamed to represent in Parliament,\nand students from Oxford Brookes\nUniversity.\" Mr Patten was in fact\nhimself educated at Oxford and was\nalso a don there, yet he seems to\nfail to see the need for a well\neducated population.\nStudent reform has not,\nhowever, been the only reason for\nrecent student displeasure. Protesting students at the University of\nEast Anglia were served with a writ\nand removed from the registry\nfollowing a weekend sit in at the\nloans office.\nStudent Loans are due to\nincrease next year following grants\nreducing by 10%. The increase in\nthe maximum level of loan gives an\neffective rise in student income\nnext year by 4%. It will also\nincrease student debt by a significant amount.\nKeith Bradley MP, the Shadow\nSocial Security Minister, expressed\nhis concern last week: \"This new\ncut in the grant will undermine\nstudents confidence in entering\nhigher education.\"\nAlthough little has been said\nregarding student grants, many\nmembers of the House of Lords are\nexpressing their discontent over the\nproposed student reforms. Many\nthink that the reforms will give the\nGovernment too much power over\nthe way in which institutions are\nrun. With many of the Lords being\nUniversity Vice-Chancellors, many\nobservers are not surprised that\nJohn Patten has faced opposition.\nSpeaking to the Independent, Lord\nBeloff, a Conservative peer,\ncommented: \" By putting forward\nthis bill, the Government has done\nsomething which I would have\nthought was impossible. It has\nunited the entire university\ncommunity, from the most\nreactionary Vice-Chancellor to the\nmost left-wing student, in\nunanimous objection.\"\nadversity to advantage.\nLife after university is full of ups and downs. To see how you could climb to the top with the world's leading business and\nANDERSEN technology consultancy, Andersen Consulting would like to invite you to submit an application to interview by Friday 17 CONSULTING December 1993 to the Careers Service.

This is a cheap chance to see one of\nthe most infamous of all horror films on the big\nscreen rather than on a bad quality video (which\nyou shouldn't do 'cause it's illegal so stop it).\nThe story concerns a young girl apparently\npossessed by Satan (well, beds levitate,\ncupboards move, she speaks in tongues and does\nsome pretty disgusting things with a crucifix). A priest is called in, whose doubts in his faith\nincrease as his mother's life wanes. Much\nvomiting of pea soup and spinning of heads\nensues with some truly frightening moments.\nHaving said this, the film relies mainly on the\ntension for its horror value, but when the shocks\ncome, they're very icky.\nThe Exorcist begins at 7pm in the Concert\nHall, 2nd floor, Union Building. Admission is\n\u00a31.20 to ICSF members and \u00a31.80 to non-members.\nThe Exorcist\nTue 14th Dec, 7pm, Concert Hall, Union Building\nFather Damien Karras (Jason Miller) in\nThe Exorcist\n/ t>A Gneiss \\\n\u2014Ofc\\p \u2014\nDue to numerous requests\nThe Bar will be open ALL DAY\nfor the last week of term!\n\n"
