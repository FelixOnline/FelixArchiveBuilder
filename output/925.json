    "content": "Letters Felix 925 7 February 1992\nGood, bad, ugly & short review Library\nDear Adam\nThere is apparently a dearth of\narts critics in the Felix office. This\nwas bourne out by Steve\nNewhouse's( The good, the Bad,\nthe Ugly and the Short) article on\nGrease. Who obviously doesn't have a clue what he is talking about.\nMr Newhouse appears to have a large piece of deep fried potato on\nhis shoulder about the \u00a38k of union\nmoney invested in the production.\nTherefore the plethora of criticism\nheaped against the cast, production\nteam and directors seemed out of\nplace.\nThe article should have been held\nback until Grease had finished its\nrun. Such a jaded article which\nlacked any form of constructive\ncriticism could not have done the\nproduction any favours. Nor would\nMutual annoyance\nDear Adam,\nWe are annoyed that DramSoc\nremoved the vast amount of Felix's from college. Felix is an\nindependent newspaper which,\nthough people insist is going\ndownhill, is infinitely better than\nother student rags. It has a dedicated\nteam working all hours to get it to\nus and it is unfair that the vast\namount of students should be denied\nthe opportunity to read about all the\nother goings-on in college.\nWhilst we can recognise that\nDramSoc and the CCUs may be\nslightly annoyed that the review was\nnot all gold, a member of the stage\ncrew did tell us that the review was\naccurate. The editorial encouraged\npeople to see the production and let\npeople decide for themselves.\nDue to these representatives of\nDramSoc committing the act of\ndepriving the students of IC of the\nFelix Newspaper we demand that\nan explanation is written as to why\nRocksoc complaint\nAdam,\nI am writing this letter to\ncomplain about the treatment of\nImperial College Rock Society in\nissue 923 of 'Felix' on January\n24th. When I enquired in person for\nan explanation on Tuesday 27th all\nI received was a mumbled T thought that's what you wanted'\nbefore you ran off to hide\nsomewhere. In the face of such\nblatant rudeness, perhaps you will\nbe brave enough to offer an\nexplanation in writing.\nImperial College Rock Society\nspend a great deal of time, money\nand effort in putting on events for\nthe benefit of the whole college.\nThe success of these events depends\non the response from the students.\nAlong with the posters and flyers\nproduced it was considered that an\nadvert in 'Felix' was the most\nefficient method of reaching the\nmajority of the student body. The\ntreatment our press release received\nat your hands was not what we\n'wanted' or expected!\nTo quote the article entitled 'Son\nof Magic Box': 'Thursday,\nIgnorance etc. IC Union \u00a321 \u00a33. I believe it's somewhere in South\nKensington. I dunno, I 've never\nbeen there.' For your information,\nand future reference, the 'Felix'\noffices happen to be situated in the\nUnion Building, and are, as a matter\nof act, right next door to the Union\nLounge, where the gig was held\u2014\na fact which is painfully obvious to\nThe mouse that roared back\nDear Adam,\nIt was with some pleasure that I started reading Christopher Adams'\nletter printed in last week's Felix.\nHowever, this soon turned to\ndisgust as he criticised the work that\nmyself, Gina Mortley and Jeremy\nBurnell have put in on Wednesday\nand Friday evenings this term.\nStanding at the entrance to Beit\nArch for over 5 hours on bitterly\ncold nights, is no-one's idea of fun,\nhowever much you are paid, and\nsome of us have done this Without\npayment.\nMr Adams had to sign in on\nFriday 24th as he could produce no\nvalid Union Card. He phoned up\nthe bar and a few minutes later\nSuzanne Ahmet came out to sign\nhim in. When I next looked in the\nbook, I saw he had signed in as ' M MOUSE', the first of several that\ntried to come into the Union that\nevening, (one of which was\naccompanied by a'D DUCK'). I phoned up the bar and asked\nSuzanne to send him out to sign in\nagain, which he did.\nThe instigation of Union card\nchecks on Wednesday and Friday\nnights, followed a series of\nincidents at the end of last term,\nwhich included an attempted rape.\nWith the involvement of the\nsabbaticals, the licensees of the Bar\nand the seven Duty Officers, we\nit have helped the union recoup e rate its investment.\nThe production was an excellent\ninterpretation of the musical-and,\nprovided a great evening's entertainment.\nYours sincerely,\nEric Allsop, Mech Eng 3\nDarrell Brown, Mech Eng 3\nSheila Shah. Mech Eng 3\nthey committed this gross act of\ncensorship as well as an apology.\nYours sincerely,\nGavin Pearson, Mech Eng 2\nMark Hearn. Mat Sci 2\nScott Stevens, DoC 2\nNicholas HH Jones, Mech Eng 2\nRichard Patterson, Biochem 2\nNC S Parfitt, Biochem 2\nKathryn Baker, Materials 2\none with even the lowest IQ let\nalone an IC student or graduate! As\nif this pur ile attempt at what I can\nonly guess is humour, wasn't enough, the article went on to say:\n'In reverse order, in third place,\nIgnorance, who I have never heard\nof. Don't blame me if they're\nshite...' If the so-called Music\nEditor, Poddy hasn't even heard of\nthe band, his biased, ill-informed\nopinions are best kept to himself.\nIt is sad enough that this style of\njournalism exists in the 'Felix'\noffice, but by sanctioning the article\nyou violated your duty as Editor to\ngive equal and fair representation.\nIf this responsibility is too much for\nyou, perhaps you would be better\nsuited applying what talents you\nreviewed our security procedures.\nCard checks are one of several ideas\nthat are being implemented\nfollowing this meeting.\nThe Union bar has a private club\nlicence, that is only members of\nICU can use it. This is not the\nUnion's idea, but the LAW, and\nlike all pubs no alcohol may be\ndrunk on the premises once\ndrinking up time is over. This a maximum of 20 minutes, not the 30\nor 40 minutes that many customers\nseem to think.\nTo answer the final points in the\nletter. If you think I have been arse-licking up to any sabbatical this\nyear, why don't you ask them? As\nSCC Chairman and an officer of\nDear Editor.\nFollowing your two reports on\nthe Central Libraries on 24 January,\nmay I offer reassurance to Ms\nHellinger and other worried library\nusers.\nFines will not apply to all overdue\nbooks: only to books from the\nheavily used short loan collections,\nor reserved by another user, or long\noverdue. A warning notice that a book is due back will always be sent\nbefore a fine is levied.\nThe proposed joint library with\nthe Science Museum, amongst other\nthings, should extend access to its\ncollections in the evenings. There\nare no plans to shorten existing\nopening hours at the weekends.\nThe Science Museum Library\ncurrently opens at 10.00am and one\nproposal is to make this the opening\ntime of the joint library. However,\nno final decisions will be taken until\nstaff and library users have been\nconsulted.\nYours sincerely\nRichard Halls, Sub-Librarian,\nReader Services.\nmay possess elsewhere.\nIt is well known that 'Felix' is\nlargely if not totally biased towards\nIndie and Rave music reviews.\nHowever, this does not justify your\nactions which caused irreparable\nharm to our event. In the three years\nI have spent at this college I have\nseen the quality and standard of\n'Felix' drop, most not ica bly in this\npresent year, with the\naforementioned copy probably\nreaching new depths. If this steady\ndecline continues I would advise my\nfellow students to stop bothering to\nread 'Felix', but if they must do so,\n'don't blame me if it's shite!'.\nAD Ham,\nVice President, IC Rock Society.\nImperial College Union, I have\nnever hesitated in criticising them\nif they deserve it. And as for the\nsabbatical position, you'll have to\nwait and see.\nFinally, Duty Officers, identified\nby their orange authority badge, are\nentrusted by the Deputy President\nand the Union with a lot of authority\nand responsibility. If ANY member\nof ICU feels that they are abusing\ntheir position, a formal complaint\nshould be made to the Deputy\nPresident, as well as the letters page\nof Felix.\nYours sincerely\nSteven Newhouse\n(Duty Officer & SCC Chairman)\n\u2014 2 \u2014\n\n"

Surely no lazy\ntramp deserves our sympathy?\nWell the answer is YES they do,\nsince if you ever talk to these people\nyou soon realise that they are not\nlazy or dropouts. They have just\nhad a lot of bad luck. Many of the\nhomeless come to London in the\nexpectation of finding a job. Last\nautumn, I spoke to a man who had\narrived from Merseyside but was\nliving in a tent at Lincolns Inn\nFields (near The Strand). He was\nan electrician with a family to\nsupport, but with no address for\npost he had no chance of finding\nemployment. And with no job he\ncannot afford down payments\n(typically \u00a3400) required to move\ninto a flat.\nThere are hostels and housing\nprojects in London, but many of the\nresidents at Lincolns Inn have\nmoved out of these. As one person\ncommented. 'We are safer in the\npark because everybody knows\neverybody else. Nothing gets\nnicked like it does in the hostels.'\nDespite everything that has\nhappened to them, most remain\noptimistic and determined. With a little help most would help\nthemselves and manage to find\nL.A. Story\nThis week Film Soc is showing LA Story, starring Steve Martin. It's an\nhilarious film about a prime-time\nweatherman who one day breaks\ndown by a motorway sign, which\ntells him his life is going to change!\nSure enough, he falls in love with\nan English reporter (his real-life\nwife aka Victoria Tennant) and also\nmeets a beautiful young woman,\nwho feels like a break from her\nusual boyfriend. He goes on a holiday with the young beauty at a discreet hotel; but as luck would\n5-a side Football\naccommodation and jobs.

At St Mary's Wilson\nHouse Gym, coach Sacha Cole\nspurred IC to a9359 win: their\nbiggest victory this season, despite\nonly having seven players on the\nbench.\nImperial led by a massive 56-26\nat half time, but looked\nuncomfortable for much of the\nsecond period. The loss of Haddon\nand Kountouris on 5 fouls put great\npressure on the rest of the team -for whom there could be no rest on\nthe substitutes' bench. David\nSyriani managed to last out the final\n13 minutes carrying 4 fouls, helping\nto keep IC's presence to at least 5\nplayers.\nWith leading re bounders Michalis\nSenis and Nick Braley unavailable,\nImperial were fortunate to be\nrejoined by Aydin Alatin. His 30\npoint contribution was a significant\nfactor in securing IC's control of the\ngame.

    "content": "7 February 1992 Felix 925 Travel\nourselves in the back of the car. we\ndid see some of the famous sights\nof Rio. Copacabana Beach, Sugar\nLoaf Mountain, the Statue of Christ\noverlooking the shanty towns, the\n'shit brown' river and the streets\nwith homeless kids. All in all. we\nwere glad to leave Rio. However\nthis involved a24 hour bus journey.\nIt did stop at four hour intervals for\nthe essentials. Oh yes, Brazilian\ntoilets - another of Brazil' s innumerable and unmentionable\nexperiences. The next stop was the\norphanage site.\nWhen I arrived the foundations\nwere dug and the well was drilled\n(by hand) to a depth of 8m. Ahead\nwas a lot of hard work, a lot of rice\nand beans and a lot of chlorinated\nwater. All this in the delightful\n4 5 \u00b0 C dry heat.\nThe site was primitive, but had\neverything in a manner of speaking.\nA hut. a tent, a cooker, the well,\na manual flush toilet and a solar\npanel array for recharging car\nbatteries and running our tape\nrecorder.\nThe team worked all the days\nthey could. We filled the\nfoundations with hand mixed\nconcrete and by the time we left, we\nhad built the walls to roof level.\nDuring this time the team got to\nknow each other very well. We had\narguments, and disagreements, but\nwe all had an excellent time.\nThe project had its set backs. A massive bush fire wiped out most\nof the surrounding land (and came\nwithin a metre of our hut), sand was\nlate in arriving, and one of our dogs\ndied.\nAmongst this work, we did see\nsome of the country.

Geneva is in the\nfrancophone part of Switzerland,\nbut since about 40% of the people\nin Geneva are foreigners, nearly\neverybody speaks English anyway.\nGeneva is also very small - in fact\nyou can walk through Geneva in an\nafternoon if you don't stop for\nchocolate, watches, kir sch etcetera.\nDon't do Geneva down though, as\nit can be a good laugh even though\nthere are less pubs in it than in the\nIsle of Man. Lesson Number 1: Switzerland is\nexpensive.\nThere is just no way out of this\none except bar thieving - and Swiss\ncops are good, and they carry guns.\nLesson Number 2: Geneva has\nless nightlife hotspots than all the\nfingers of two people (or four one\narmed people).\nBut since most of you couldn't afford to spend more than one night,\nin Geneva anyway, there are more\nthan enough for a good night out.\nLesson Number 3: Swiss beer\nsucks.\nThis is totally une s capable and\nthe only way out is to buy imported\nbeer which is quite expensive, or to\ndrink spirits which are even more\nso.\nOnce you have come to grips with\nthese three lessons (spend a night\nor two studying them in front of a pint or two or six) you are ready for\n(aka la gare). You should wander\ndown to the lower ground floor of\nthe railway station and exit through\nthe north door, with one of the\nmajor banks on either side - UB S and SBS. and go on past\nMcDonald's and turn left just after.\nA few yards further, turn to your\nleft into a restaurant called Manana\nand go down to the basement. You are now in the 'Cactus club.' Avoid\nthe beers; they are tasteless, bland\nand very expensive. It is essential\nfor you to arrive there during the\nhappy hour which usually lasts for\n360 minutes from 6.00pm to\n9.00pm although you had better\ncheck this.

Switzerland also has the\nhighest GNP per capita in the world\n(a trivial pursuit question) and the\nstandard of living is not all that low\neither.\na wild night out in 'Geneve,\nCosmopolite. Captivante et\nCapitaliste.'\nHow to get pissed on less than\n\u00a320:\nThis is virtually impossible but\nanyway, here goes. When you\narrive in Geneva you will either be\nin Geneva airport (aka Geneve\nCointrain) or in the railway station\nB52, which is Bailey's, Kaluha and\na dash of Grand Marnier set on fire.\nDrink this very fast, with a straw.\nAlternatively try their lush Pina\nColada or their nice and sour\nKamikaze. This should set you back\n\u00a32 a go (during happy hour) and\nwhen you're bored or happy hour\nis over, leave for the Post Cafe, the\nmost English non-pub around. The\nowner is British, always drunk and,\nsurprisingly an ex-physics student\nfrom Edinburgh, I think. Mention\nmy name and he'll tell you to fuck\noff because he has no idea who I am, although he hates my after-shave. Drinks are very cheap there,\nboth in and out of happy hours.\nTequila goes for just over a quid a shot, and miracles of miracles -Guinness is on draught! Equally\nworthy of attention is a local Swiss\nscrum py nicknamed' drain bam age.' Once you are satisfied\nwith yourself, and the bar floor\nstarts to defy the laws of gravity,\nyou may go on. Further along this\nstreet you will find the Star pub and\nthe London pub, both very boring\nbut worth a visit if you've ever\nwondered what a Swiss-English pub\nlooks like, but if you're too pissed\nto bother, let me tell you it looks\nnothing like the real thing.\nThe next step is rather more\ndifficult as you must now find your\nwas to the other side of the lake.\nLake Geneva is part of river Rhone\nand although everybody says it's clean I wouldn't risk a dive in it.\nTo go to the other side can be made\neasy if you use a bridge. There are\nmany handy bridges about but for\nall practical purposes I suggest you\nuse the Pont du mont-Blanc. On the\nway you really must admire the\nhighest water jet in the world - Le\njet d 'eau de Geneve. At this point\nyou have two alternatives, visit\nmore drinking spots or buy some\n\u2014 18\u2014\n\n"

Branches of countless pines\nbrushed past on either side,\nreaching out\u2014grasping\u2014but never\ncatching him. 25, 30, 35mph \u2014he\nwas unstoppable.\nSuddenly Ryan knew that he was\ngoing to crash. His cucumber-sharp\nmind took in the rapid approach of\nthe moist, grassy bank, the trees,\nthe impending doom...\nRyan had fallen prey to one of the\nmost fearsome of all earthly\nexperiences\u2014an IC Cycling Club\nMountain Biking Weekend.\nNine swarthy club members left\nthe noisy midday throb of Southside\nBar, destination Snowdonia, with a lump in their throats and a stirring\nin their trousers at the prospect of\nthe adventure ahead.\nAfter six long, painful hours in\nthe Union minibus, hills hove into\nview. Appreciation was voiced in\nthe form of ripples of excited\nflatulence which resonated along the\nlush Welsh valleys.\nUltimately the group reached\nBangor Youth Hostel, and a short\nwhile later, a pub in the centre of\nthe city. By now it was 9pm, and\nwe weren't quite prepared for the\nsight that greeted us. Considering\nit was Friday night. Bangor was\ndeafening ly quiet.\nIt didn't take very long (about 3'/2\nminutes) for us to collectively agree\nthat Bangor was shit. This feeling\nremained for the rest of the\nweekend.\nSomething else therefore had to\nbe done to provide entertainment,\nand the provision came on Saturday\nmorning in the form of\nmountain bikes that were hired from\nan enterprising youth in Betsw-y Coed for a reasonable sum. He also\ngave us some hand-drawn maps of\nthe area, which proved to be about\nas much use as a cat in a condom\nfactory.\nThe Chairman of the Club, Craig\nWilson, then tried in vain to kill us\nall with the first hill which, although\ntarmac-ed. must have been at least\na1:3 for over a mile. At the top he\nthen admitted that it was actually the\nwrong road anyway but the rest of\nthe party hit him until he agreed that\nit WAS the right road and if we only\ngo...e rrr... left. no right at these\ncrossroads we'll be near the right\ntrack again.\nNot many of us fully recovered\nfrom this first climb, but despite the\nblood gushing audibly through the\nveins in our ears and our throats\nhurting from inhaling the cold, dry\nair we were forced to continue on\nour journey by a large Dobermann\nwhich had come bounding\nanarchically up the hill after us. its\nlong tongue throwing gobs of foamy\nsaliva as it ran. It didn't appear to\nbelong to anyone (or at least no one\nappeared to want it) which only\nadded to its threatening charm.\nThe laws of science dictate that\nwhat goes up must come down, and\ntired though we were, we knew\nthis. The exhilaration of throwing\nyour aching corpse over the top of\na mountain, starting the headlong\nrush to regain some kinetic energy,\ncan only be described as, well,\nindescribable. As we gained speed\nwithout the usual need for physical\nexertion, we realised why we enjoy\nsecond. Needless to say the\nDoberman didn't turn up when it\nwas most needed to corroborate the\nstory.\nThe Forestry Commission have\nyet to send Ryan the bill for the\ndamage he caused to the grassy\nbank, which is under sedation in a remote hospital in the Lake District.\nA small family of squirrels and\nthree moles have put their names\nforward as key witnesses to the\nincident. The rest of the group\nfound this accident amusing, and it\ngave much conversation for the\ncoming evening in Bangor. Even\nCycling in Wales\ncycling. Our speeds got higher and\nhigher as the inevitable competition\nbegan to see who could reach the\nbottom of the valley first.\nHalfway down Ben was leading,\nwith 37mph on the clock. For a while, Ryan was 'not far behind'.\nAnd when he was just 'behind'. A corner had caught him unawares,\nand the skid marks in the\nphotographs indicate his\napproximate angle of approach.\nEventually the carnage was cleared\naway, and the blood licked up by\nthe big mad bastard dog which was\nstill following us around. The rest,\nas they say, is history.\nRyan's front wheel was buckled\nbeyond repair, but, being true IC\nstudents, we re-engineered it\n(jumped up and down on it with\nhighly scientific precision) until it\nwould turn in the forks again.\nOthers amused themselves by\nthrowing sticks for the dog. Instead\nof returning the stick to the thrower,\nthe mindless beast would chase the\nstick and chew the fuck out of it in\nthe most endearing manner. To our\namazement Ryan cycled another\nfive miles on the knacker ed wheel,\nonly slightly slower than we went,\nwhich says something doubtful\nabout his mind's response to the\ncrash. The wheel cost him \u00a3 1 0\nwhen we returned to the bike hire\nplace, because the blok e didn't really believe Ryan's story that a big black Dobermann that had\nfollowed us at 20mph for the last 15\nmiles had distracted him for a split\nRyan himself saw the funny side of\nit in the end.\nOn Saturday we ventured back\ninto Bangor city centre, but this\ntime to the University Union. A rigorous check of Union cards was\nmade at the door. Two meaty\nbouncers stood together glaring at\nnew arrivals while more lurked in\nthe background with malicious\nintent. By the time we had all\nmanaged to get into 'Joes' there\nwere exactly 11 people in the bar,\nand 9 of them were IC students.\nShit. What a groovy place to be at\nUniversity. Made us really feel at\nhome...Predictably we got sick of\nthat and left soon.\nSunday, we bugger ed off into the\nmountains again, but the enthusiasm\nstarted to waver as people began to\ninvent stories about injuries, vital\ninterview preparation and itchy\nshorts etc. So in the afternoon there\nwas just four of us in the mountains,\nand arguably the fittest four, it\nmight be added. We thrashed\nourselves silly for another couple of\nhours until the whip broke, so we\ndid a bit more cycling. This was\nwell worth it, and the rest of the\ngroup kept saying afterwards 'Oh\nI'd have come if I'd known you\nwere only going to be another\nhour.' Yeah! Pull the other one...\nWe returned to London at\n9.30pm into the steamy throng of\nSouthside Bar, our limbs stronger,\nour hearts bolder, our spirits high,\nand our clothes a covered in Welsh\nshite.\n9\n\n"

We were\nshown two entrances, the only ones\nknown, both apparently previously\nvisited by \"Americanos' (probably\nthe Italian group in 1988). Despite\nits altitude, the potential in this area\nmust be low since both entrances\nwere choked a few metres in. and\nthere were springs just below in the\nvillage.\nLomo Meregildo was a plateau at\n1400m, again reached by mules\nfrom Guyabal. We were shown two\nshafts on the south side of the hill\nLos Patios, both ending at 10m depth, and from this high point we\nscanned the area east with\nbinoculars. It didn't look too\npromising, being yet more\nundulating terrain with conical\ndepressions, covered with coffee\nand banana plantations. Two sinks\nwe did investigate were completely\nchoked with vegetation, and there\nwere springs only 10m below.\nThe area around the village of\nPolo, in the east en Sierra de\nBaoruca. looked promising on the\nmap with springs around the village\nat 700m, and some very large\nclosed depressions of between\n300m and 700m about 15km further\nwest. We visited the area for one\nday from Barahona to check these\nleads. The springs were just that,\nwith no entrances, and the locals,\nwho farm the surrounding area, had\nno knowledge of any cave entrances\nfurther west. The limestone in this\narea was much less massive than\nthat in the Sierra de Neiba. being\nrather impure and shattered. An American group had previously\nreached the generally inaccessible\nwestern end of the Sierra de\nBaoruca. 25km away, but had\nfound very little. On this basis it\nseems unlikely that Baoruca is the\nmost promising range for caves as\npreviously thought.\nThe final area visited was in the\nCordillera Central, which has the\nhighest peak, Pico Duarte (317m), in the Caribbean. From Los Copeyes (550m). an 8km mule\njourney northeast led to the\nCatanamatias Valley (1050m). This\narea had been visited once by the\nCircolo Speleologico e Idrologico\nFruilano from Udine. and they had\nexplored the main sink to the\nnorthwest of the village. The Furnia\ndel Cuadro (aka Respiradero del\nDiablo) is, at - 3 8 0 m. the deepest\ncave in the Republic. We marked\nall the entrances in the valley and\nlogged them on an enlarged map.\nEight of these entrances gave access\nto significant caves, such as Cueva\nMalaria - 7 3 m, Cueva Queso\n- 5 1 m, and shafts from 10m to 45m deep. On the hill to the west the\nmain discovery was Cueva Avenger, a shaft system to \u2014 196m. To the east, in the Carrizal valley.\nThe Caving Team\n180m of active river passage led to\na sump in Cuevo Rio at \u201432m.A small group spent a day walking\n8km west to a promising karstic\nplateau at 1450m. north of Loma El Picacho. This area was the only one\non the expedition to have large areas\nof exposed limestone. Cueva del\nHombre Muerta yielded human\nremains, presumably from ancient\nburial. The main find here was\nCueva Machete, which went to 25m length and - 150 depth before we\nran out of time, with the rift\ncontinuing on down.\nThe Dominican Republic\n\u2014A Paradise Lost\nThe expedition combined recon na is ance of three hill ranges\nwith detailed exploration of particular caves, and there are still\nleads in the Catanamatias area.\nBack in Santa Domingo we heard\nof more caves, massive and filled\nwith treasure or voodoo spirits, in\nthe Cordillera Central, but by then\nthe rum was flowing, the merengue\nmusic beating loudly, and our flight\nback the very next day.\nThe Republic has beautiful coasts\nand mountains, and a rich national\nculture, but these are being lost in\nits unrelenting drive towards\nwestern style unsustainable\ndevelopment. Though the likelihood\nof finding caves in the Sierra de\nNeiba and Cordillera Central\nremains good, the potential must\nhave been decreased by the\ndevastating effects of deforestation,\nfallen trees, mudflows. and\nlandslips which have been found\nblocking many entrances and shafts\nin both the Dominican Republic and\nHaiti, denying exploration and\nunderstanding of the caves.\nExpedition Members\nC Birkhead.

One\nsecurity guard stopped a group of\npeople from removing Felices from\nthe Department of Computing but\nthe rest went missing without being\nnoticed.\nMiss Hellinger has since\napologised for her actions, saying\nthat it was one of the 'stupidest\nthings' she had ever done, but said\nthat she would not resign unless\nstudents thought that it was\nnecessary, and that she would be\nputting her case to the\nExtraordinary General Meeting\n(EGM) of the Union held yesterday\n(Thursday).\nRumours that a 'motion of no\nconfidence' in the Union President\nwould be put to the EG M proved\nfalse, but a motion was passed\nwhich intended to ensure that any\ninterference in editorial control or\ncensorship of student media would\nbe a disciplinary offence in future.\nWhen asked if she felt that she had\ngot off 'scot free', Ms Hellinger\nreplied 'you have put me though\nhell in the past three days' in a reference to the vigorous response\nof the College's student media to the\ndisappearance of Felix. Ms\nHellinger also stated that she would\nnot interfere with the production of\nFelix again, but could not give that\nguarantee for anyone else.\nIC Rag, whose event 'Cluedo'\nwas advertised in the purloined\nedition of Felix, are to be\ncompensated for the low attendance\nat the event. Dramsoc and Opsoc\nhave issued an apology to Rag for\nthe damage caused and have agreed\nto raise at least \u00a3750 for charity.\nDetails have not been finalised, but\nthe money will not come from\nGrease profits but from the\nindividuals involved. Since Rag also\nlost out on general publicity and\ninterest in events, members of the\ncast will be helping at the Rag Fete\non 16th May. Ms Hellinger\ndescribed Rag as the 'victims' of the\nremoval and was 'deeply sorry' for\nthe effect of the action.\nPetitions\nRepresentatives of the Selkirk and\nTizard Halls Residents' Committees\nmet with Mr Angus Fraser, IC\nManaging Director, and Mr Gordon Marshall, Director of\nEstates, to discuss a petition\ndistributed to heads of all\ndepartments.\nThe petition drawn up by the two\nhall committees and signed by over\nthree-quarters of hall residents,\nexpressed general dissatisfaction\nwith the poor conditions in\nSouthside Halls.\nIn a letter distributed yesterday to\nall residents on a34 week licence,\nMs Sheelagh Crampton, Accommodation and Conference Manager,\nstated that blocks of rooms in\nSouthside, Linstead and Weeks\nBio Flood\nThe fire brigade had to be called to\na flood in the new Chemistry\nBuilding, last Friday evening. An\nengine from Kensington fire station\narrived within four minutes of the\ncall to aid college technicians who\nhad discovered the flood.\nThe flood started in one of the\npump rooms in the basement of the\nBiochemistry department and had\nreached a depth of over three metres\nbefore being discovered. SubOfficer Marks, one of the officers\ndealing with the flood, said that the\nhigh pressure water had to be turned\noff to prevent the water level rising\nfurther. As a result of this there was\na risk of fire from overheated\ndistillation tanks within the\ndepartment.\nThe fire engine remained at the\nbuilding until there was no longer\nany danger from the tanks\noverheating and left at\napproximately 1.00am. Halls will be set aside for business\nuse, whilst the remaining rooms\nwill be free for student use. It has\nalso been confirmed that students\nwill not have to pay business rates\nand that adequate storage space will\nbe made available.\nThe petition listed a number of\ncomplaints about facilities\nprovided, including excessive rent\nlevels and completely inadequate\nsecurity. According the report of\nthe meeting, the committees did not\nbelieve that security would improve\nwhen the new college-wide\nmeasures are implemented. The\npetition ended by threatening to\ndamage college recruitment by\nletting prospective students know\nwhat conditions are actually like.\n\n"

If you\nwere to decide to indulge in the\nlatter just direct your feet to the\naptly named Jardin Anglais - or\n'English Garden' where you can\nbuy the stuff (of course I wouldn't know what it is although I think they\ncall it Shit - pronounced a la\nFrancaise - or Hash). However, for\nthose of you who - like me - have\nnever ever even come close to the\nstuff, just ask somebody the way to\nBar le Planteur or in Shakespeare's Language, 'Planter's.' The drink\nthere is quite expensive but it is also\nwhere many of the international\nschool (and thus English speaking)\nstudents hang out. It is also fair to\nadmit that this place has lately been\ninvaded by rappers, so beware.\nNext step is to find the way to 'Lord\nNelson's pub.' Nelson's is the place\nto be, crowded, smoky, expensive\nbut full of women (and men for you\nof the weaker sex, I'd hate to be\ncalled sexist). Drink is very\nexpensive there, about \u00a32.80 for a pint of Swiss lager, though you can\nbuy bottled Guinness or canned\nNewcastle Ale which are hideously\nexpensive. Just get one drink,\nmellow out and social is e. Talking\nis free in Switzerland. For those of\nyou out there who smoke, look no\nfurther, a pack of cig s goes for just\nunder \u00a31.50.\nNight Clubbing.\nFor a town of its size, Geneva is\nquite well stocked with night clubs.\nThey are, not surprisingly, very\nexpensive. But have no worries,\nnobody said you had to visit all of\nthem.\nOn the side of the lake you\ncurrently should be on, there are\ntwo night clubs worthy of your\nattention, the 'Underground' and\nthe ' New Morning.' The first one\nis located in the Veille Ville, or Old\nTown. The Old Town is a very\nbeautiful location and marks\nGeneva's original site. Even if you\ndon't wish to go to a nightclub the\nOld Town is a compulsory visit -just walk about in it and gaze at the\nantique shops and at the art\ngalleries. The 'Underground,' like\nmost very expensive and exclusive\nnightclubs, has only got a tiny door\nwith a bouncer that wouldn't even\nfrighten a5 foot train-spotting\nphysicist, thus, your first challenge\nis to find it. The best way to do so\nis to ask someone who looks rich\nand who drives an expensive car.\nThe other way is to walk about the\nold town and find a door with a Ferrari and a Porsche or two parked\nin front of it. The second challenge\nis to actually get in as the only to\ndo so is to look rich. This doesn't mean dressing up nice - it just\nmeans smelling of - no stinking of\n- magic money power. Or you can\nGeneva Cathedral. Not a wild place.\njust to go with someone else that\nknows his way in. Once inside\nhowever, you shall see whether it\nwas worth the effort. The cocktails\nserved in the two bars of the\nUnderground are worthy of attention. It is fair to say however,\nthat since you do not pay an\nentrance fee. drinks are quite\nexpensive.\nDo not worry if you did not\nmanage to locate or enter the\nUnderground as there is a very\ngood bar a few yards up from it, the\nRoi Ubu (Ubu King). It has an\namazing selection of superb Belgian\nbeers - the Belgians and the trapp is t monks are certainly amongst the\nbest brewers in the world. 1 highly\nrecommend the M orr Subite\n(Sudden Death) or Chimay, both\ntypes of ge u ze, the Belgian\nequivalent of bitter. The ' New Morning' is located just beside the\nlake at Quai des Forces-Motrices\n(Motor-forces quay). The entrance\nfee has recently increased to about\n\u00a37, although the. location with view\non the lake is very pretty, the\nambience varies from great to\nmer de ab sol ue ment( the editor\ndoesn't like naughty words) (-which is why I have translated it\ninto French - Ed). \u2022\nProbably the most\" famous nightclub in Geneva is 'Arthur's'. 'Arthur's' is big. very big. It has\nfour dance floors, four bars and a VIP section. Thus, since rents are\nexorbitant in Geneva, it could not\nafford to locate itself anywhere else\nthan in a new Movenpick Hotel\ncomplex beside the airport. The\nonly to get there late at night is to\nwalk, which is not suggested\nalthough you won't get mugged in\nSwitzerland, to take un Taxi or to\nhitch- hike. Entrance is free on\nweek days before 9.00pm( I think)\nbut it certainly isn't on Fridays and\nWeekends. The entrance should set\nyou back \u00a312 and each non\nalcoholic drink will cost you a fiver,\nor more depending on the alcohol\ncontent. The answer to this problem\nis to get pissed before you go to\nArthur's. The music for the dance\nfloors, whether good or bad, is\nunimportant since whatever they\nplay, everybody goes on dancing.\nIn short, Arthur's is a very wild\nplace indeed and if you can only\nafford one bar or nightclub you\nshould go to this one. Beware that\nthey will absolutely not let you in\nwith a pair of trainers so get a proper pair of shoes beforehand.\nIf you spend over a night in\nGeneva another place worthy of\nattention is L 'Vsine (the factory).\nI don't remember where it is located\nbut I do remember that it has live\nbands and stuff like that and that it\n.is usually very cheap (my God, a miracle!) Also 'Short's', located in\nthe Old Town, may have reopened\nsince my last visit to Geneva. It\nused to be a bar with no entrance\nfee and a nice little dance floor.\nMaxim's is only for the very rich,\nand the only way I could afford it\nwas to go with a friend who knew\nthe manager and thus got me free\nentry and drinks. Maxim's is a cabaret with a show of lovely young\nladies covered with little material\nindeed.\nWell, there you go - that's all\nfolks, if you manage your money\ncarefully, you can get mildly\nbuzzed with \u00a310 and get into a night-club with the remaining \u00a310.\nUnfortunately there are about as\nmany chances of this happening as\nthere are of the Queen Mother\ngetting pregnant again! So really,\nthe only way out is to bring loads\nof do sh. By the way, if you ever\nvisit Switzerland, do bring me back\na nice bar of Swiss milk chocolate\nand drop it here c/o Felix.\n- 1 9 \u2014\n\n"

This is\nbecause I am still fuming over the\nsubject matter.\nAttempted censorship of Felix is\nnot new. Last week members of\nImperial College Union Dramatic\nand Operatic Societies, including\nICU President Zoe Hellinger, stole\nabout 3500 Felices from the\ndistribution points around college in\nthe belief that the review of\n'Grease' would damage the success\nof the production.\nIn 1987 Felices were removed by\nthe then City and Guilds Union\nUnion Bit\nPapers are up for sabbatical\nelections just over a week away, so\nif anyone missed the plea for people\nto sit on ballot boxes on 9th/10 th March come and see me. The pay\nis \u00a33 per hour. Other than election\nPurity Test\nDear Felix,\nThe Imperial College Science\nFiction Society is compiling a Purity Test aimed specifically at\nstudents of Imperial and would\nwelcome any suggestions or\ncomments. For those who have not\nencountered one before, a Purity\nTest is a humorous questionnaire\ndesigned to assess the eh tics and\nexperience (sexual or otherwise) of\nGerbil Responds\nDear Adam,\nRe: The name 'Lobo'\nMy point was that while 'Lobo'\nis not a laughable name of itself, it\nis if one assumes it under false\npretences, much as if I were to\nclaim to be French and change my\nname to Valerie Giscard D 'Estaing.\nPresident, David Tyler, in protest\nto a news story which he did not feel\nhad been reported fairly. Eventually\nthe 3000 Felices were replaced and\nMr Tyler apologised, though stating\nthat he thought his action was\njustified. I believe that Felix was\nsubsequently sued over one of the\nstories it ran.\nIn 1981 the last issue of the year\nwas stolen by persons unknown, for\nno obvious reason, though there\nwere a number of suspects. In this\ninstance the entire issue had to be\nreprinted, and no justice was\nforthcoming.\ntime fun, you can keep yourselves\noccupied with ents discos next\nWednesday and Friday and the\nmassive rag BIBIC collection on\nSaturday 16th. That's all.\nCheers, Steve Farrant.\na students. Copies of several past\nPurty Tests can be found in the\nICSF li bary.' Anyone with a recommendation\nor suggested question can find me\nin the ICSF library most lunchtimes\nor can leave a note in the Mech Eng\npigeonholes.\nSincerely,\nNicholas Farrow.\nICSF Librarian.\nApologies for any offence caused\n(none intended). I myself have long\nbeen burdened with such an\nextravagantly peculiar name that I am forced to sign myself.\nThe Flying Gerbil.\nReviews Editor, Felix 91-92.\nOne wonders where individuals\nwho conduct such actions get their\ngall from. Why should the students\nand staff of Imperial be kept in the\ndark? In this case the main publicity\nabout the Rag Cluedo event, which\noccurred the following Saturday, as\nwell as all the events occurring on\nFriday, Saturday and Sunday which\nwere minuted in the What's On\npage had been removed. If an\nindependent reviewer - 1 did not\nwrite the review on Grease - wants\nto write something derogatory about\nit, why shouldn't he or she? Am I given to understand that the reviews\npages are not allowed to say\nanything but good about ICU\nevents? I fail to see the point of a newspaper if it is muzzled by any\nother organisation. In any case the\nreader would soon get wise and\nignore such a newspaper.\nBoth Zoe Hellinger and DramSoc\nhave admitted to their complicity in\nthe affair and have issued apologies.\nBut it was inevitable that an apology\nwould be forthcoming and this is\nnot an issue which can be dismissed\nwith just that. It is very likely that\nmany of those involved would not\ndo it again, but it can be guaranteed\nthat an attempt will be made to\ncensor the College Media in the\nfuture unless it is known to be\nunacceptable. Certain members of\nthe Students' Union still think that\nthe action was justifiable - by which\nis meant that it would be done again\nin similar situation. It is up to you,\nthe readership, to decide whether\nyou want to have the College Media\ncensored whenever it is convenient\nfor a minority. Remember that I was elected to defend the editorial\nfreedom of Felix and that it must\nhave been assumed at the time of\nmy election that I was to decide\nwhat went into Felix and when it\nwas to be published. It may have\nbeen a wrong assumption - in which\ncase I should be no-confidence d. Zoe Hellinger was heavily\ninvolved in the production of\n'Grease', leaving only Steve\nFarrant (Honorary Secretary,\nEvents) to run the union office for\nlarge periods of time as Jonathan\nGriffiths (Deputy President) has\nbeen ill in hospital. I can see why\nthe removal occurred, I can\nunderstand why Zoe thought she\ncould take part in that action to\ndefend the Union's interests.\nFirstly, I do not think the review\nconcerned would have damaged the\nproduction's takings, and secondly,\nthe Union is comprised of the\nstudents of the college, and\nselectively keeping them in the dark\nso that they spend what little money\nthey have on any theatre production\nis unethical. If I had received that\nreview and refused to publish it for\nwhatever reason, that would be\ncensorship. In fact I am stuck in the\nno-win situation whereby I am\nresponsible for everything in Felix,\nyet ethically bound to give voice to\nanybody's opinion. If you object to\nany opinion in any newspaper, the\nway to counter it is not be slating\nthe editor or newspaper, telling\nthem that they have no right to\npublish the opinion, but to write to\nthat newspaper elucidating your\npoint of view. Since any opinion is\npublished, so will yours. This\napplies to the RockSoc letter as\nmuch as the Felix theft situation. In\nthe words of the disclaimer - 'no\nopinion expressed in Felix is\nnecessarily the view of the editor,\nthe newspaper or any of the staff.'\nIf you think the quality of Felix, IC\nRadio or STOIC is low, the way to\nimprove them is by joining the\nalready hard working group of\nvolunteers who make them what\nthey are. I am working eighty hours\na week as it is (sigh pitifully) - there\nare no more hours in the week to\ndo any more work in.\nHaving asked advice from an\nindependent source, I have been\ntold that there is little point in taking\ndisciplinary action against those\nresponsible as it would be difficult\nto prove wrong doing. Therefore I feel I have to go through different\nchannels. This will involve finding\nthe individuals who were\nresponsible - by their means or by\nmine. There will be no victim is ation beyond that - I believe that\nindividuals have to be made\nresponsible for their own actions,\nand part of that is owning up to what\nyou have done. The admission and\napology from DramSoc and OpSoc\nthrough Richard Harrison,\nDramSoc President, I am grateful\nfor and is good as far as it goes, but\nthose who did it must find the\ncourage to put themselves at the\nmercy of the same readership that\nthey denied Felix to. If I know the\nIC readership at all, they won't give\na damn.\nCredits.\nStef, Toby, Sam, Simon, Poddy,\nAndy, Jonty, Scott, Stuart, Marge\nInalia, Mario and Andy, Jeremy,\nJames, Declan, Troy Tempest\n(who e 'er he be), Dave, all the\nreviewers, Steve F, Rose,\nKhurrum, Steve N, Ian, Chris\nRiley, Simon Burton, the caving\nexpedition members those who\nwrote the cycling in wales articles\nwhom I have forgotten and of\ncourse les Sacs-a Dos mange s et\nPhergies claire s at va rie uses.

    "content": "7 February 1992 Felix 925 Reviews\nWalpurgis Night\nLost for\nWords\nThis play, written by Venedict\nErofeyev, has been translated from\nthe Russian by Snoo Wilson, and is\ndirected by 24 year old Dalia\nIbelhauptaite. It is set in a psychiatric hospital. Our hero\nGurevich admits himself to the\nhospital so that he can be close to\nNatalia who is a nurse. This would\ndefinitely raise questions as to his\nsoundness of mind. He is in Ward\n3, surrounded by loonies of one\ndescription or another. There is\nlittle plot beyond this. As each of\nthe 'inmates' takes it in turn to pour\nout their heart, any philosophical\nquestions raised are trivial is ed and\nabandoned. The events go beyond\nfarce in the second half when all of\nword 3 break into song and then,\none by one, leave this mortal coil.\nI don't quite understand what this\nplay was trying to do but it failed\nin all areas as far as I was\nconcerned. They used cheap\nanalogies, crude symbolism and\nclich e after clich e. The direction\nwas awful. With such a big cast and\nsome well respected actors in it, I was disappointed that most of the\nacting was appalling, except for the\nacting genius of the catatonic\ninmate.\nWalpurgis Night runs until the\nend of February. Phone the Box\nOffice on 071-229 0706 for\nperformance times and prices.\nDarwen.\nWhat can I say?\n'Absolutely hilarious' are two good\nwords when describing this book.\nDeric Longden's bizarre way with\nwords and phrases keeps you in\nstitches for most of the novel and\nin tears for the rest.\nAfter the death of his wife, he is\nleft with little more than nightmares\nand his dithering mother. His\nmother is a sweet old lady whose\nheart is in the right place but,\nunfortunately you can't say the\nsame about her brain.\nIt is basically his memories of the\nmonths spent trying to get back into\nthe feel of writing so soon after his\nwife's death, mainly because they\nall feel it would be good for him.\nHis children are supportive, his\nmother is b army and the blind\nwoman who he moves in with is\ndetermined not to let her disability\nrule her life.\nI loved the book, it has its\nhumour, its sadness and even the\nhanging questions all in the right\nproportions. Read it and see if you\nnearly wet yourself when you read\nabout the sprouts just as I did.\nD BC The Camomile Lawn The Antipope\nMary Wesley started writing in her\nmid-sixties and has a whole life time\nof experiences to draw on, this\nshows in all of her books.\nThe Camomile Lawn is a story\nabout seven cousins and their\nfriends, set around the time of the\nsecond world war.\nThe story starts with the cousins\nmeeting on their regular summer\nholiday at the old aunt's house in\nCornwall and goes on to record\ntheir lives throughout, the war,\nincluding the various partner\nswapping and sexual experiences.\nThe sex itself is not actually\ndescribed, making you use your\nown imagination and preventing\nMs. Wesley from stooping to the\nlevel of Jackie Collins and the like.\nAlthough the story line is limited\nand very tacky, the book holds a lot\nof charm and is written with a very\ndry sense of humour. The novel is\nbased mainly in London, but the\nodd snippets of. country life in\nCornwall help to relieve the tension.\nThere are many different\npersonalities in the novel; my\nfavourite of them is an old general\nwho thinks that Hitler is a well\norganised and upstanding member\nof the community, and that the\nNurnberg Rally was all round good\nfun. His attitude doesn't help when\na couple move into the area after\nescaping from the Nazis in Austria.\nTheir son is in a concentration camp\nand the General more often than not\nputs his foot in it completely. I enjoyed the book immensely\nalthough it is directed more towards\nthe female population.\nD BC Robert Rankin tries far too hard to\nbe like Terry Pratchet but\nunfortunately does not succeed. The\nstory line for this book is humorous\nenough and it is a shame that he\nattempts to turn Brentford into a scene from the Disc World.\nOn to the story, Neville the part-time barman and general underdog\nwakes up one morning feeling not\nquite right. The tramp who appears\nlater that day is the key to it all.\nWithout giving the story away too\nmuch the book ends with a holy\nexorcism; fire, water and a few\nLatin phrases. The book loses its\ninitial humour towards the end but\nthe element of drama is introduced\nto fill the gap.\nHaving lived near Brentford for\nmost of my life I managed to get a feel for the area but, as the\ndescriptions provided by Mr. Rankin were fairly vague, any one\nwithout my knowledge is likely to\nlose interest very quickly.\nThe characters were developed\nbut unfortunately very late and\nmeant that you did not have time to\nexperience feeling for them.\nI can't say I didn't enjoy the book\nat all, it did have its moments and\nif there is nothing else to do, worth\na read.
