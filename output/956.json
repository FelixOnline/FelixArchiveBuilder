Miss\nNicky Fox, Union Housing Officer,\ntold Felix that if there were any\nstudents who were still not happy\nwith the lease they hold, they should\nget in touch with the\nAccommodation Office to see if\nthey can change it. She went on to\nsay that if students wanted to either\nleave there rooms late, or come\nback early, to study for exams for\nexample, they should also go to the\nAccommodation Office and explain\nwhy they needed their rooms for the\nextra time. Any student staying in\nhalls over the vacation will be\ncharged normal rent, not\nThis year's sabbatical elections will\nbegin on Monday 8 February, when\npapers will go up for the nomination\nof candidates. A range of posts will\nbe open for election, comprising\nPresident, Deputy President,\n'commercial' rate as was suggested\nby the Accommodation Office last\nyear.\nSpeaking to Felix, John Hassard,\nWarden of Selkirk and Tizard Halls\nof Residence, said that he\nunderstood the importance of\nmaxim ising income from the\naccommodation, but that the\nstudents shouldn't be\ninconvenienced. Dr Hassard went\non to say that more rooms should\nbe available for storage of students'\nbelongings over the vacation, and\nhe couldn't see why only three or\nfour rooms should be provided, as\nwas the case last year, when\nmaximum occupancy of the halls\nover the Easter period was only\n60%.\nHonorary Secretary Events (Hon\nSec Ents), and the joint post of Felix\nEditor and Print Unit Manager.\nElections will also be held for\neleven non-sabbatical posts,\nincluding Ents Chairman, Welfare\nBoat Racing\nby Jacob And elin Imperial College is to host the first\nNational Indoor Rowing\nChampionships.

Social Trends\n1993 also shows that polytechnic\ngraduates are twice as likely to be\nunemployed as university\ngraduates, and that the number of\ngraduates training to be teachers has\nincreased by two thirds.\nEducation Department figures\nshow that while the number of\nmedicine and dentistry graduates\nfell by 100 in the year to 1990/1,\nOfficer and External Affairs\nOfficer.\nEach candidate must be proposed\nby a full member of Imperial\nCollege Union, and seconded by\ntwenty others.

Hustings, where candidates\ncan be questioned, will take place\nin the Students' Union at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School on\nMonday 2 March. South\nKensington hustings will take place\non 4 March.\nAlthough no candidates have yet\nto formally declare that they are\nstanding for election, speculation\nabout possible candidates is rife,\nwith most speculation cent ring on\nthe post of president. Rachel\nMountford, Rag Chair, is expected\nto put up a strong challenge, as\nMark Swan, St. Mary's Students'\nUnion President, may propose her.\nMs Mountford's main rival is\nexpected to be Marc Ellis, last\nyear's Rag Chair. Mr Ellis,\ncommonly known as Penguin, may\nalso be proposed by a influential\nmember of St. Mary's Students'\nUnion. The St. Mary's vote, which\nhas proved significant in electing\nImperial College Union sabbaticals\nin past years, now seems uniquely\nopen to the possibility of a split.\nAnother possibility for President\nis Andrew Wensley, who would not\ndirectly confirm the suggestions,\nbut instead suggested that he might\nstand for Felix Editor and Print Unit\nRowing Champion, will be\npresenting prizes, and guest\nappearances may be made by Andy\nRipley (ex- England Rugby\nInternational) and Matthew Pinsent,\nOlympic Gold Medallist.

The\nnumber of engineering and\ntechnology graduates, and\nmathematical and computing\ngraduates both increased by 4,100.\nThe numbers of full time\nundergraduates has increased by\nover 8% in the year to 1990/1, with\nthe proportion of female students in\nall full time degree courses\nincreasing by almost 10% during\nthe last ten years.\nManager.\nThe election for Deputy President\nis forecast to be the least contested\npost this year. David Goddard, ex-Broadsheet Editor is said to be\ninterested in the post, damping\nspeculation that he would stand for\nFelix Editor and Print Unit\nManager. To some muffled\nexpressions of surprise, Phillip\nHenry, ex Phoenix Editor, is\nactively searching a proposer for the\nposition of Deputy President. At the\ntime of going to press, Mr Henry\nhad yet to secure a proposer.\nCharlie Leary, Chairman of Jazz\nand Rock Club, has been mentioned\nas a candidate for Hon Sec (Ents).\nAn Ents candidate may also be put\nforward this year, as Dominic\nWilkinson, this year's Hon Sec\n(Ents), was involved with Ents last\nyear. This year's Ents Chair is\nAndy Kerr.\nRebecca Land has been interested\nin the position of Felix Editor and\nPrint Unit Manager since last\nsummer, and was expected to have\nan uncontested election until Ian\nDavis announced his intention to\nstand for the post. An amicable\ncontest, though deemed unlikely by\nsome, has not been ruled out.\nOther contenders will\nundoubtedly appear before papers\ncome down and nominations close\non Friday 19 February.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n5 February 1993 Felix 956\nMalaysian night ICSF-double\nOn the February 6th, the Malaysian\nSociety will present Malaysian\nNite, an evening dedicated to the\nheritage that reflects the Malaysian\nlifestyle, culture and cuisine. The\nbuffet, which proceeds the stage\nperformances will be prepared\nprofessionally and shall consist of\nmouth-watering dishes that only\nMalaysian culinary skill can offer.\n\"These include Nasi Minyak,\nliterally meaning 'oiled' rice,\ncooked over a base of onions, garlic\nand selected spices; d aging red nang,a savoury dish of stir-fried\nbeef in a curried gravy of chillies,\nspices and coconut milk; Nasi\nDilau, a yellow rice with origins in\nNorthern India, cooked with spices\nand coconut; and Ay am masa km era h, meaning 'red fried chicken',\nspiced and sau teed with a tomato-based sauce. These dishes are just\nsome of the gastronomic variety of\ndelicacies that will be served and\neverything is halal.\nThe stage performance later in\nthe evening will consist of sketches,\na contemporary dance and\ntraditional dance which stem from\nthe many diverse cultures of\nMalaysia. Amongst these are\nTanian Lilin, the 'candle' dance\nbased on an old Sumatran tale\ndepicting the devotion of a maiden\ntowards her fiance as she searches\nfor her lost engagement ring in the\ndark; the Ngajat, a warrior dance\nof the tribal peoples of Sarawak; the\nLion Dance, which is a Chinese\ndisplay of acrobatic skill; the\nRibbon Dance, performed with\ngraceful movement. The\nprogramme also includes a 'Silat'\ndemonstration, which is the\ntraditional Malay form of\nself-defence.\nTo conclude, all I can say is for\nyou to forget the cold and the rain,\nbut come to support the show and\nyou shall find yourself transported\ninto the enchantment of the Far\nEast.\nWolves dancing\nWinner of seven Oscars including\none for best picture, and, arguably\nthe best 'politically correct' movie\nto come out of Hollywood, Dances\nwith Wolves is definitely a modern\nclassic.\nDirector, producer, and star\nKevin Costner had to put his\nreputation on the line to get it made,\nyet still managed to create a film\nwhich elevated him to super-star\nstatus.\nCostner plays Lt John Dunbar,\nwho is given a choice of postings\nby his superiors after an act of\nheroism during the civil war. He\nchooses a remote part of the\nAmerican mid-west so that he can\nsee more of his country while he\nstill has the chance.\nBut, Dunbar soon finds the\nloneliness of the plains\noverpowering until he befriends the\nlocal Indians who have lived on the\nland for centuries. This leads to a tragic chain of events in which\nDunbar is forced to make an\nextremely difficult decision.\nAs well as using real Red Indian\nactors, the film really accentuates\nthe beauty and vastness of the midwest due to the super photography\nand should not be missed.\nSo, here's your chance to see it,\nbecause FilmSoc will show Dances\nWith Wolves at 7.30pm in Mech\nEng 220 on Thursday February\n11th. Entry is \u00a31.90 for nonmembers and 90p for members and\nremember that membership is now\nonly \u00a33.50 with the first film free.\nExploring space\nThe IC society of Students for the\nExploration and Development of\nSpace (IC-SEDS) presents a lecture\nby Mr Frank Miles on ' TV Coverage of Space from Apollo to\nthe Space Shuttle', that will take\nplace on February 10th in lecture\ntheatre 408 Electrical Engineering.\nMr Frank Miles is programme\nproducer and science editor at\nIndependent Television News,\nLondon and has specialised in space\nreporting for ITN since the Apollo\nmissions in the late sixties. The\nlecture will concentrate on the TV coverage of space missions and its\ndifficulties. Mr Miles will also\npresent previously unknown\ninteresting and amusing facts about\nmany important space mission TV reports.\nThis coming Monday, ICSF is\npleased to present another great\ncinematic double-bill. Firstly we\nhave Predator 2, sequel to the\nclassic Arnie action e er. This time,\nthere's no Arnie, but instead we get\nDanny Glover (from Lethal\nWeapon), Gary Busey (from Lethal\nWeapon), Bill Paxton (from Aliens)\nMaria Conchita Alonso (from The\nRunning Man) and the Predator\n(from\u2014wait for it\u2014Predator). The\nfilm is fast, slick and has some\nbrilliant action sequences.\nSecondly, we intend to show John\nCarpenter's( Assault on Precinct\n13, The Live, The Fog, Halloween)\nclassic remake of The Thing,\nstarring Kurt Russell. This film\npossesses terrific special effects by\nRob Bottin (Legend, Robocop,\nBasic Instinct and Total Recall).\nThe first film starts at 6pm in\nChem Eng LT1. The second at\n8pm. Membership is just \u00a33. For\nwhich entry to your first\nfilm/double-bill is free. Existing\nmembers get in for just 50p for one\nfilm of 70p for both.\nOrienteering\nThe Autumn Term was a very\nsuccessful one for the 'O' club. In\nthe Greater London Orienteering\nChampionships ace runner Gary\nJefferson came 1st in the M19 class,\nRagnhild Balsvik 1st and Tone\nCecilie Nystrom 3rd in the W21\nclass.\nIn the Cambridge Sprinto Tone\nCecilie made it through to the finals\nwhere she came third. Jake Badger\ndid a blistering run to come 9th overall.\nOther major events included the\nKarrimor International Mountains\nMarathon and the November\nClassic National event. We finished\nthe term off with a training weekend\nin frosty Sherwood Forest. Great\nfun was had by all.\nWe have another action-packed\ntimetable for this term (including\nsome night orienteering) and shall\nbe competing in the British\nUniversities' Championships and\nthe international JK over Easter.\nPage 12\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews5 February 1993\nTheatre\nWorlds A partI liked this play for two main\nreasons: The first is that it\nsuccessfully took the piss out of the\nBritish Government and secondly\nbecause it took the piss out of the\nnew immigration procedure at an\nairport, which was devised by the\nBritish Government. I'm not anti-government and do not strive for an\nFelix 956\nanarchic environment, but it is\nrefreshing and healthy to see British\nwriters exploit serious errors in our\nleaders' policies.\nWorlds Apart does no good for\nthe people of Yorkshire since the\nhead of the immigration is\nportrayed as a bigoted Yorkshireman. His passion for cricket and\nother northern traits shine through,\nmaybe because the actor was born\nand bred in Yorkshire? I have no\nidea how true his character was to\nhis real personality, but his\nperformance was fantastic.\nMade to sweat it out in a locked\nroom, the five detained immigrants\nlearn quickly to help each other out\nand attempt to get on well. But\nsome characters just don't develop\na rapport and this results in a handful of hilariously entertaining\nbitching sessions. I am particularly\nreferring to a wealthy, successful,\nAsian businessman and an\nAmerican airforce engineer, who\nargue about just about everything.\nMusic, sport, politics, they cover\nthe lot.\nThe story runs parallel to a Tibetan parable told by a Tibetan\ndetain ee, which applies loosely to\nthe main storyline. This is a really\nclever tactic by the writer because\nit adds another dimension to the\nplay, enhancing the Tibetan feel to\nit. It also enables bizarre interludes\nthat provide a break from the play,\nwhich I feel are more of a theatrical\nequivalent of space-filling than a serious pause from the action.\nConclusion: Go see!\nP. Tentious\n\u2022 Theatre Royal Stratford East,\nGerry Raffles Square, Stratford\nEast tube. Box Office 081-534\n0310. Tickets \u00a32-\u00a312.\nTil'1 Worlds Apart\nThe Last Yankee This new play by Arthur Miller\ncurrently receives its first British\nairing at the Young Vic, directed by\nDavid Thacker. Dealing, as ever,\nwith contemporary American life,\nit is set in a state mental institution\nand follows two different men, both\nthere to visit their wives who are\nsuffering from depression.\nAn immediate contrast exists\nbetween Frick, a no bullshit, fast\nbuck American businessman and\nthe younger, Leroy Haviton.\nCarpenter Leroy's 'You just have\nto love this world' contentment with\nhis mediocre lot in life, bemuses the\nsuccessful Frick, since he also\nknows that Leroy is descended from\none of the country's great\nforefathers. His wife Patricia also\nfinds him frustrating with his\napparent lack of ambition, while\nKaren, Frick's wife, finds solace in\nher husband's ignorance of her.\nThe Last Yankee is a careful\nstudy of the way in which feelings\nof insufficiency and disappointment\nhave come to the fore of the minds\nof these four different people, and\na distinguished cast of Peter\nDavison (All Creatures etc, A Peculiar Practice), Zoe Wanamaker\n(Prime Suspect), Helen Burnsound\nand David Healy, all performing at\ntheir best in the intimacy of 'the\nround', makes for an intense,\nmoving yet off-amusing production.\nAt an hour and twenty minutes\nlong, this play will not tax the bum,\nbut still leaves one uneasy in the\nseat\u2014Miller again manages to\nportray incisively the feeling in\nAmerican society that the world has\nnot turned out to be quite what it\nwas first taken for.\nTom M. \u2022 The Young Vic, 66 The Cut\nage 6\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nFelix 956 5 February 1993\nOn a bike and a prayer\nChris Riley starts across the Atlas mountains and discovers that cycling\nwasn't such a good idea after all\nWe left the metropolis on a chilly,\ncrisp morning where you could see\nyour breath. We peddled out\ntowards Anergui, three hours after\nSaid left. It was still only 8.45am as we passed him plodding in front\nof his mule.\nWe peddled on up the little\ndonkey paths that climb out of the\nImilchil basin, keeping well ahead\nof the mule to avoid scarring the\nbeast, which unfortunately seemed\nto have a phobia about bikes. The.\npoor animal was loaded with two\nstraw weaved panniers which\nbulged with packs, sleeping bags\nand mats. It swayed from side to\nside like some lol loping camel. As\nthe track climbed our front wheels\nbounced uncontrollable and our rear\nwheels span uselessly, forcing us to\ndismount and shoulder the things.\nWith buckling, bowing and\nstumbling legs we thanked our\ninsight and lack of pride for renting\na guide and mule for the bags.\nThe summit of the pass of Tizi\nbought no relief, as the ground\ndropped more steeply than it had\nrisen. There was no mule track. The\nroute consisted of a steep rock\nstrewn river bed - freshly sprinkled\nwith giant sized debris. The mule\nand Said disappeared like free-fall ers from a plane, leaving us to\ntrail blaze alone. Having carried my\nbike up, I was damned if was going\nto carry it down again, like some\nawkward piece of luggage. By\nleaning back behind and below the\nsaddle it was possible to bounce\nover anything and everything -although by the end of the day this\napproach was to cost me five\nbroken teeth on my chain set and a broken spoke on my front wheel.\nAndrea and Stephane preferred a more cautious descent - trying to\npreserve their bikes. They seemed\nmore conscious of the fact that their\nwasn'ta bike shop in a million miles\nof where we were; and there were\nstill over 800km left.\nThe bottom of the descent\nbrought us to the river, winding its\nmuddy way through the Atlas. We\nfollowed its summer starved trickle\nup stream and round its golf- green\nbanks nestling in the red dry rocks\nlike a vein of life. Stopping on these\nbanks for a lunch of bread and\nsardines, we scrounged some tea off\na shepherd boy.\nAs we finished our yoghurts, the\nrain started to spit down on us. Said\nimmediately started to fluster and\nfuss explaining that the river would\nflood very quickly. We donned our\nwaterproof gear and peddled\nthrough the brook upstream a bit\nfurther and then across the muddy\nfields of crops lining the growing\nriver. Other shepherds materialise d, their large, unwieldy herds spilling\nover the cliffs and crags like spilt\ntreacle.\nLittle stone dwellings - like\nCornish tin-cutters cottages - sat\nbelow the heavy sky and awe-struck\npeople peered from the doorways at\nus, three madmen on bikes in the\nstorm. The rain grew stronger and\nturned to hail which hammered on\nmy felt hat and pinged off my\nhandlebars and frame. Stephane and\nI fought on, heads bowed to shelter\nfrom the sting of the storm. Andrea\nwas flagging behind, her asthma\nholding her back as she fought to\nforce the bike through the quagmire\nof ground squirming beneath the\ntyres.\nThe storm passed and the sky\nlightened briefly. We stopped to let\nSaid catch up. He arrived and shook\nhis head to dry his hair, like some\nbig shaggy Afghan hound. The land\nahead rolled gently upwards in vast\nopen short-cropped grassy slopes\nwalled in by steep red crags -darkening in a blackening sky\nahead. We were aiming for a large\ncrag at the far end of the valley,\nwhere we were to pitch the tent. As\nwe passed through the valley\nnomads swarmed down from the\ncrags above, neglecting their flocks\nto come and investigate our convoy.\nBehind the crags, a previously\nsteel grey sky had blackened\nbeyond recognition of day. The\nblackness laid a path for a monstrous electric-storm which\nswept in like an evil spirit released\nfrom the Ark of the Covenant - with\nearth-shaking thunder claps and\nphotographic flashes of sheet\nlightening. We watched like rabbits,\nhypnotised by the lights of a car, as\nSaid struggled to get a tent up. The\nlight show was followed by layers\nof hail - the size of-birds eggs. It\ngrew steadily heavier and harder,\nuntil the noise on the tent was too\nloud to shout above, and the ground\nwas white and icy.\nWhen we finally unzipped the\ntent, a white-out blizzard scene met\nour eyes - the golf-green valley\ncovered in a foot of hail, with a red\ntorrent of uncontrollable water\ngushing Nile-like down the centre.\nDrenched donkeys and soaked\nsheep hobbled past with numbed\nhooves as if towards a promised\nArk.\nDay two of this pass bought a vast\nstony desert plateau. Football sized\nboulders sat stuck in a smooth red\nmud that coated the wheels and\nclung to the brakes. Between these\nstretches were huge tables of\nlimestone and basalt. We carried\nand bounced the cursed bikes for\nover two hours to cross it and\ndescend the other side to a tight and\nsinuous river gorge. Climbing up\nthe other side we hung the bikes\nacross our shoulders again, front\nwheel and handlebars bumping on\nthe stomach. At the shade less burnt\nsummit, we had to stop to patch up\nbleeding knees, elbows and fingers.\nWe had used a lot of water to\nprepare the Tajine stew the night\nbefore, and now only had half a litre\nleft between the four of us for the\nrest of the day.\nIt was almost midday when we\nleft, and we managed to cycle\nlengthy stretches which took us up\nto the stunning ridge above our\ndestination village of Anergui. We\nstood on the edge at 3953 metres.\nThe village below was at 1465m;a difference as great as the height of\nBen Nevis.\nTo our dismay the descent was\nmore draining than the ascent or the\ncrossing of the plateau. For almost\nfour hours back wheels skidded and\nbucked with locked brakes and front\nwheels j it te red and jumped.\nClenched fists and taught fraught\nbrake cables left our hands numbed\nand trembling. The mule fell twice\nin front of us, and Said twice as\nwell. I lost count of my tumbles.\nOur room in Anergui was\noverwhelmingly spacious after the\ntent the night before. The floors\nwere carpeted, the walls clean and\nwhite, and the ceiling adorned with\na pleated blue plastic sheet. The\ntiniest three month old kitten\nscrambled and tumbled about the\nplace, as it took sanctuary in our\nluggage from the strutting bantams\nthat periodically strayed into the\nroom.\nStephane chased the birds\nprovocatively round the floor in a clumsy waltz as I tried to tune a SW\nradio we'd discovered into\nsomething newsy and informative.\nWe settled for France-and-air and\na music show of fluctuating volume.\nThe Beegees crackled in a corner\nas we wrote our journals and played\nchess until the light from the candles\ndied.\nPage 9\n\n"

This\ncomplimentary drink has been\ngiven in past years to DramSoc\nmembers helping with the Festival.\nAs a result of Miss Mountford's conversation with Ms Hurford, a meeting was held in the Union\nOffice, with Chris Davidson, Union\nPresident, Rick Bilby, Union\nDeputy President, Mandy Hurford\nand Andy Kerr among those\npresent.

Wearing a baby's dummy as\na ring falls straight into the\npretension trap (please note, Sloan's Chris Murphy). It shouts 'look\nwe're really wacky', a certain death\nwish in anyone's diary.\nOr so I thought during the first\ncouple of rotations of Sloan's 'Smeared' album; a band trying too\nhard to impress in an already\ncrowded market. But we all have to\nbe humble. Yes, I admit, I was\nhasty, pleading on grounds of\ndiminished liability. 'Smeared' is\none of those dying breeds which\ngrows on your brain, slowly oozing\ninto the deepest cracks.\nThe two upstanding tracks are T am the Cancer' and the rakish 'Take\nIt In' which crackle along, pressing\nall the right buttons.

    "content": "Reviews\nSalome Oscar Wilde's play was directed by\nLoveday Ingram for Leap Before\nYou Look Productions. It was\nstaged at the White Bear Theatre in\nKennington which is linked to a cosy pub with the same name. The\ntheatre is in a room behind the pub,\nwith two rows of seats on two sides\nof the room, the rest of the room\nbeing the stage. Accordingly, the\natmosphere is very intimate and\nintense, which was fortified by a musician, Clive Bell, who played\nMiddle Eastern instruments, and the\nbackground which was hung out\nwith cloths.\nAlthough Oscar Wilde's play is\nbased on the biblical story, he\nturned Salome into a selfish,\nmalicious monster who couldn't bear to be rejected by Jokanaan and\nhence wants his head although\nHerod begged her to have all kind\nof other things instead. Well, Oscar\nWilde has a reputation of misogyny\n- as has the Bible. (There, Salome's name isn't mentioned at all;\nprobably the whole story has been\nmade up anyway. Indeed it is\nknown that Herodias had a daughter\nwith this name; however, it is\nbelieved that John the Baptist was\nexecuted because he was considered\npolitically dangerous - and this was\nby Herod Antipas and not Herod the\nGreat, as often believed.)

But then, the\nincredible happened. RFH in their\nonly two attacks of the game, from\ntwo corners managed to equalise!\nThey then closed themselves in\ndefence hoping to hold out until the\npenalty shoot out. IC attacked\nviciously, hit the post for the\numpteenth time and only managed\nto score in the last minute of the\ngame, T Botzio's lob hitting the\npost (!!!) and J Mottashed getting\nthe rebound to put IC in the semis\nand earn himself his second hattrick of the season, leaving A Galloway, IC's other forward,\nsulking for having temporarily lost\nhis leading goal-scorer title.\nIf SPORTS RESULTS Badminton Football\nIC 1 1-0 Essex IC 1st32 RFH\nSurrey 0-1 IC II Dribblers 3-2 Kings College\nHockey\nIC 2nd XI 3-2 Kent\nSTOP SMOKING The Health Centre\nis running a series of\nworkshops if you want\nto quit apply now to\n15 Prince's Gardens\nor phone 3099\nAll three of Imperial College's badminton team qualified for the\nplay-off round which was held last\nweek.

The ladies\nmatch was won by a walk-over and\nthe ladies moved one step closer to\nthe finals.\nFor the first time this year the\nmen's firsts put out a full team. As\na result we were too strong for out\nopponents and blitzed them 8-1.\nThe same could not be said for the\n2nd team though who were quarter\nfinalists last year. Only 2 of the\nregular 6 players were present to\nplay and on the day an incomplete\nteam of 4 travelled to Guildford\nwith dim hopes and the knowledge\nthat 3 points had to be conceded.\nThis turned out to be an\noverwhelming disadvantage and it\nwas with surprise that the team\nmanaged to grab a consolation point\nout of the available nine.\nThe next round of the tournament\nwill take place on 10th February so\nthose of you who have always\nwondered how the game is played\nplease come and support us on that\nday.

We were soon one-nil\nup as Juliette kicked a cork er into\nthe top right hand corner. The\nopposition soon levelled and at halftime the score was a well earned\none-all. They apologised for not\nhaving oranges and gave us a bottle\nof water instead. Is the team always\nthat thirsty or had they been\ndrinking the night before? I hope\nit's the latter we've a reputation to\nuphold. Paula had some excellent\nruns up the left and amazing cross\nput us ahead again.\nWith twenty seven minutes to go\nthe opposition scored again. The\nscore was two-all when a lucky shot\nwas fumbled by their goalie putting\nus ahead with-only thirteen minutes\nto go.

First\nyears: some history!\nThat is, of course, not quite all.\nPrior to that date, stations on the\nline had been served by\nunderground trains for over 100\nyears. The original Metropolitan\nLine stations between Baker Street\nand Wembley Park were opened to\n(steam) trains on dates between\n1868 and 1909, and then between\n1913 and 1915 the tracks were\nduplicated between Finchley Road\nand Wembley Park providing two\ntracks in both directions. From\n1909, the stations now served by\nJubilee Line trains were served by\nMetropolitan trains between\nWembley Park and Finchley Road.\nIn 1932 the Metropolitan Line\nTravelling\nThe Mind!\nCTS TRAVEL...Reduces the Cost!\nNORTH AMERICA\n071-323 5180\nEUROPE\n071-637 S601\nLONG HAUL\n071-323 5130\nMEXICO\nBOSTON\nCHICAGO\nDALLAS\nLOS ANGELES\nMIAMI\nNEW YORK\nORLANDO\nSAN FRANCISCO\nTORONTO\nVANCOUVER\nWASHINGTON\n205 360 AMSTERDAM\n97 192 CAIRO\n93 186 MUNICH\n122 241 BRUSSELS\n124 240 PRAGUE\n112 224 GENEVA\n93 186 MADRID\n118 235 MILAN\n124 247 PARIS\n122 226 ROME\n171 318 TEL AVTV\n93 186 VIENNA\n44 79 AUKLAND\n108 219 BANGKOK\n60 115 KATHMANDU\n35 71 CARACAS\n75 129 DELHI\n87 10Z HONGKONG\n60 83 JO-BURG\n57 99 NAIROBI\n38 69 RIO\n62 120 SINGAPORE\n99 169 SYDNEY\n63 125 TOKYO\n359 657\n199 399\n239 439\n202 398\n205 329\n267 469\n264 473\n206 379\n284 547\n231 435\n334 661\n265 489\nROUND THE WORLD\n\u00a3799\n44 Goodge Street\nLondon W1P 2A De GOODGE STREET\n1AT A Licensed\n220 Kensington High St.\nLondon W8 7RA \u00a9HIGH STREET KENSINGTON\nif, was extended again, to Stanmore,\nthe northern terminus of the Jubilee\nLine today, and on its way, created\na whole new suburb: Queensbury\ngets its name from the station,\ncoined as a partner to Kingsbury.\nThe Metropolitan Line was now\nseverely congested between\nFinchley Road and Baker Street,\nwhere trains to and from six stations\nterminated as far afield as to within\nten miles of Oxford. To alleviate\nthis bottleneck, twin tunnels were\nexcavated between Finchley Road,\nthrough new stations at Swiss\nCottage, and St John's Wood, to\nBaker Street. There were\npreviously three stations between\nFinchley Road and Baker Street,\nremnants of which can still be seen\ntoday\u2014indeed, one of the station\nbuildings is used as a restaurant.\nAt Baker Street, the tunnels\nconnected to the Bakerloo Line\ntracks, and the service to Stanmore\nwas transfered to the Bakerloo Line\nin 1939, and the Swiss Cottage and\nSt John's Wood stations opened and\nare those used today.\nIn 1949, a report issued by\nLondon Transport, which led\nslowly but directly to the Victoria\nLine mentioned another proposal,\nfor a line running northwest-southeast across central London and\ninto South East London. This\nresurfaced in 1962, in a definite\nproposal for a line running under\nFleet Street, to Lewisham, via\nLudgate Circus, Fenchurch Street,\nSurrey Quays and New Cross using\npart of the East London Line, with\na possible later extension to\nThamesmead.\nIn 1969, Royal Assent (which is\nneeded to build any tube line) was\ngranted by the government in 1969,\nfor the first stage, running from\nBaker Street, via Bond Street,\nGreen Park and Charing Cross to\nAldwych. In 1970, the Greater\nLondon Council ( GLC, RIP),\nagreed to meet 25 % of the cost, and\nin 1971 the Government agreed to\npay the remaining 75 %, and work\nbegan near Bond Street in late 1971.\nDuring the year of the Queen's Silver Jubilee, in 1977, the GLC decided to change the name and the\nJubilee Line was born. In 1979, the\nstation between Baker Street and\nCharing Cross was opened to the\npublic. The tunnels extend to\nAldwych, but the last section is\nunused. In June 1979, the\nGovernment decided that cheaper\nalternatives to the extension through\ndocklands should be considered,\nresulting in the abandonment of\nplans to extend the Jubilee, and the\nconstruction of the Docklands Light\nRailway.\nNEXT WEEK: What Jubilee did\nnext.\nPage 8\n\n"

Within\neach group each team will play each\nother team once, and points shall be\nawarded depending upon the\noutcome of each match; 3 points\nwill be awarded for a win, 1 point\nfor a draw, and no points for a loss.\nThe top two teams from each group\nwill qualify to enter a second phase\nof the tournament, which will be a knock-out stage.
