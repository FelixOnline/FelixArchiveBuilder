    "content": "Page 2 FELIX30 th May, 1973\nLetters to the Editor\nSir.\nIt was with the deepest feeling of regret that\nI read the tale of the sad\ndemise of Mr. Ron Appleby and his missing\n400 copies of Broadsheet ghosted away during the night. The very\nthought of such a perversion of literary genius\nmna kes my eyes fill with\ntears and my breast\nheave with sorrow. And\nas I stop to wring out my\nshirt may I offer him my\nsincere condolences.\nUnfortunately being\naway from college on the\nnight concerned I cannot offer any light as to\nwho were the perpetrators of this dastardly\ncrime but I suggest Mr.\nApplepie should cheer\nup. After all he should\nfeel heartened that in at\nleast one fan of Broadsheet who is not only\ncontent with his quota of\n1 copy but wants the\nwhole satisfaction of\n400! (a potential \u00a34.00\nworth\u2014rotten jews). It\nis remarkable Mr. Applepie has not called in the\npolice to investigate this\nrotten felony. Is he hiding something? Is he\ncovering up? Could our\nintroverted friend in a sudden fit of puritanical\nfrenzy have flung the\nwhole damn lot down the\nCollege incinerator.\nWe must wait and see\nif these call-girls mean\nthe downfall of our esteemed editorial colleague after such an admission of incompetence. After all Guildsheet has no distribution\nproblems with its 700\nplus fun-filled copies:\neven complete with full\nfrontal covers.\nWhich reminds me Mr.\nDowson; what about the\ndistribution of your glorious Felix. In days of\nyore when I arrived for\nfirst lecture on a Tuesday there used to be a pile of mint Felixes (or\nis it Felices) waiting for\nme. Now not even coming into lectures at all I can scarcely find a copy\nof Felix anywhere anytime on the appointed\nTuesdays. Is this Sabbatical efficiency?\nYours sincerely,\nCharles M. Wrigley\nEditor, Guildsheet.\nSir,\nWhilst in the union\noffice recently, I happened on a copy of SENNET. This is, of course,\nthe Journal of the University of Lpndon Union.\nI was immediately struck\nby the finely set out col-um ns, the quality and\nnumber of its illustrations, the superb nature\nof its up to date and extremely relevant news-reports, all with perceptive and witty editorial\ncomment. The sports\npage, to which I do not\nusually cast my eyes in\nthe National Dailies, attracted me immediately.\nThe contributors would\ndo justice to the back\npages of the Observer. I wondered who could it\nbe that was architect ing such a literary pearl.\nInvestigation as to the\nidentity of this Beaverbrook of Malet Street revealed that the post was\nbeing filled on a part\ntime basis by a person\nwho is registered at this\ncollege. Surely I thought\nsuch Talent could work\nwonders as editor of\nour humble Organ, FELIX. Could we not provide\nhim with a sabbatical allowance and, giving him\na free hand, sit back and\nenjoy the benefits of his\nefforts. Ih my estimation,\nconsidering the nature\nof his achievements on\nSENNET, a mere three\nhours, per issue, of his\ntime should be sufficient. He would then be\nfree to do whatever he\nwanted. Perhaps edit the\nTimes, or Punch or perhaps squeeze his black-heads.\nShould anyone wish\nto make the Sennet editor an offer, he can be\ncontacted in the Felix\nOffice. Just ask for Oily\nDowson.\nYours,\nR. LI. Loltey (Tariq)\nSir,\nFollowing the recent\ntrend of Felix (editor)\nbashing I would like to\npropose some constructive ideas as to how the\nunion may obtain value\nfor money both from\nFelix and the 3rd sabbatical officer (Felix edi-tor).\nI would like to see the\npost of Felix editor and\npublicity officer combined and elevated to executive level. This would\nI believe mean that the\neditor has a more detail\nknowledge of what is\nhappening in this college and thus help promote events. Felix then\nmight even carry up to\ndate reports, pictures\nand news. I believe that\nthis would enable the\nless active members of\nthe union to identify\nthemselves with a union\nwhich does, despite its\nlack of publicity, have\none hell of a lot going\non.\nI have specified that\nthe editor should have\nexecutive level responsibility to try to eliminate the alienation which\nhas occurred this year\nbetween the editor and\nunion. The exec must\nwork as a team on Felix\nbecause it is THEIR\nnewspaper to represent\nthe activities and interests of the union. It\ncould also eliminate\nproblems such as responsibility for distribution so that the wretched rag does not lie\naround the union office\nfor days, as happened\nto the last issue.\nFinally I would like\nto emphasise that it is\nthe responsibility of\nclubs and societies to\nsend reports to Felix,\nand the editor should devote more time to chasing such news, rather\nthan obtaining the more\nobscure type of articles\nwe have seen this year.\nMalcolm Newman\nP.S. \u2014 Congratulations\nMr. (broadsheet) Appleby on publically admitting that res exec are\n' exceedingly childish '\n(Felix No. 336).\n* The Editor will be giving his own views on\nhow the FELIX editorship should be run in the\nnext issue, which will be\nthe last this year.\nDear Sir,\nIn the name of Christianity, Mr. Veall has\nshown the Church is\nbent. He has shown\nnothing bent about\nChristianity.\nIn the name of Marxism, it is obvious that\nRussia et al is not exactly straight. Nothing\nhas been shown \"not\nstraight\" about Marxism.\nAs a follower of neither doctrines, and having little faith in either,\nmay I wish upon both,\nan adaptation of an old\nshowbiz expression:\u2014\n\"Kindly leave the page\".\nYours faithfully,\nP.W. Jowitt.\nJOHN LANE\nPresident's Piece PRICES\nAlthough Friday's Finance and Executive Committee's of IC's Governing Body heard a recommendation from the Secretary of the College Mr. Davies for a5 per cent increase in Refectory prices,\nthe final decision will not taken until the full meeting of Governors at the end of June. The Union observers put the case for no increase arguing\nthat the \u00a320 additional increase in grant cannot be\nregarded as an excuse for allowing further in fla tion. Since all colleges and universities are faced\nwith similar deficits if they refuse to put up prices\nand deliberately breach the U. G.C.(i.e. Government) regulations then the Government will have\nto give way and either sub sid is e refectories or better still increase grants to such a level that we can afford the economic price for a meal. Apparently\nthe Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals\nare considering some joint action but whether it\nis the sort of firm stand that we have asked for\nis another matter.\nOn the brighter side the increases would not\ntake place until the beginning of next session when\nit would be easier to mount some resistance to\nthem whereas at the beginning of August this would be well-nigh impossible.\nVACATION FIELD COURSES Over the last few months the union has made\nrepresentations to the College about the financial\nhardship incurred by students having field courses\nduring their vacations. A typical Geology student\nmight lose \u00a3110 because hotel bills are around \u00a33\na night while the subsistence grant is only \u00a31.20\n(\u00a3200 in potential earnings in vacation over 3\nyears).\nThe Rector's reaction was to circular is e Heads of\nDepartments with guidance that where possible they\nshould take all financial arrangements for travel,\nboard and lodgings out of students' hands so that\nno hardship should arise. If this was not possible\nthe previous situation would apply. At first sight a substantial victory but would the finance be avail-able?\nThe money available would increase from\n\u00a324,000, the U.G.C s. amount to \u00a330,000 but, what\nif this was not enough? The departments could claim that for financial reasons it was not \" possible\" to make all the arrangements themselves,\nand the students would be left exactly as before.\nAt Friday's F&E meeting the Rector did give some\nassurances. Departments can take money from\nother sources to supplement the money earmarked\nfor field courses. Also the Rector did believe that\nthere would be no hardship this summer and if\nthere was going to be any he wanted to know. We have proposed that the sum allocated should be\nbased on a survey of field course needs rather than\nan a rbr it ra ry figure but in the short term if you are going to be left out of pocket because of a field course get onto your Departmental Rep. or myself, now. INSURANCE Next session if you have an accident in College\nyou will have automatic insurance cover. This has\narisen from representations to the College from the\nthe P/G Committee about this issue. The final details have not yet been settled but a typical policy\ncovering both post and under graduates might give\n\u00a31000 for death or loss of limb or eyes, or \u00a310 per\nweek for 2 years for a less permanent injury.\n\n"

C.B.C on\na scale which has not been enjoyed for many years.\nSaturday 12th saw I.C.'s already reported victory in the\nU.L. Allan Cup. On Thursday, 17th the I. C.1st and\n2nd VIII's were on show at the Metropolitan Regatta\nat Putney. This regatta, which is held over 3 days, is\none of the oldest and most impressive in the country. In\nthe semi-final of the Senior A VIII's,I.C.'s opponents\nwere Emmanuel School. A disastrous un practised start\nfrom the stake boats saw I.C.|L down very quickly.\nHowever, the long zoom course gave I.C. plenty of time\nto gather themselves and row powerfully through the\nschool to win by \u00a3L. Meanwhile the 2nd VIII went straight into the final\nof the Senior C event against Nat. West Bank and\nTwickenham. After taking an early lead of J LI. C. were disqualified for steering into one of the other\ncrews. It was later found that I.C. had lost the fin off\ntheir boat.\nIn the final of the Senior A VIIIs, I.C. rowed against\nPutney Town and their old adversaries London R.C. I.C. went off the start at 40 and soon pulled out fL lead\nover London. This lead was maintained as they dropped to 38 at the mile post and just touched 36 at Barn\nElms. Putney were well out of it by this time but Lon don attacked coming towards the Black Buoy. In the\nlast minute the I.C. lead varied between ^ L. and a can-vas. As strokes eyes glazed over he made one last desperate attempt hold off London, and since for once all the rest of the crew were with him he succeeded. With the rate at 42 I.C. crossed the line ^ L in front of Lon don.\nThe celebrations were not as prolonged as usual, because two days later three I.C. VIII travelled to Thames\nB Ditton to take part in the regatta there. The Novice\nVIII had their first race on the Friday night and after\nleading for most of the way, were unlucky to lose by 3\nfeet. The 2nd VIII unfortunately had to scratch as they\nwere a man short.\nThe 1st VIII were again rowing Senior A and their\nfirst round opponents were Barclays Bank. A very\npoor row over a very short course saw them scramble\nto an unconvincing ^ L win. In the semi-final they met\nthe powerful Kingston R.C. The1 st VIII, who are\nnot slow off the start, were left standing by Kingston,\nwho by halfway, were just clear. What happened next\nis uncertain as everybody at this stage thought that\nKingston would win. In the next minute the I.C. boat\nprobably moved faster than it has done before and\nKingston, who were nowhere near as fit as I.C., despite\ntheir length lead, never stood a chance. I.C. went right\nthrough them to win by ^ L. The time recorded in this\nrace was the fastest of the day by some 8 seconds.\nThe outcome of the final against Vesta R.C. was\nnever in much doubt as I.C. had dealt savagely with\nthem in training. Rowing well within themselves. I.C. won by 2 L. In the next few weeks I.C. will be appearing at the\nfollowing Regattas. June 2nd \u2014Chiswick, June 9th Wal ton, June 16th( Internal regatta) Putney, June 24, Mar low and June 26th to July 7 (Racing 4th to 7th) at Hen ley. Any support would be welcome.\nGLIDER SMASH\nAce IC glider pilot\nMike Alexander brought\nICU Gliding Club's first\naccident to pass when he\ncrash-landed the other\nweek.\nThe glider is now to\nbe rebuilt, since this will\nsave a considerable sum over the purchase price\nof a replacement. Council agreed at its meeting\non Monday to grant\n\u00a3200 to cover the difference between the insured\nvalue and cost of reb u il ding. The insurance\ncompany have agreed to\npay the full sum insured\nless \u00a325 excess and\nallow ICU Gliding Club to salvage the wreck-age.\nAs Council pointed\nout, the gliders are obviously under-insured,\nand steps are now being\ntaken to correct this.\nMISFIRE The purchase of a.22 automatic pistol was\nagain deferred by Council, pending further investigations by the Athletics Clubs Committee.\nMany uses were found\nby Council for this\nweapon, and Martin Black has volunteered\nfor target practice.\nFelix wishes everyone\nwith their ea^ an is Felix is back again with Summer Fun on June 12th FELIX No. 3 3 7 ; Wednesday, 30th May, 1 9 7 3 .\nEditor: Oliver Dow son.

A sinister\ngroup of call-girls calling\nthemselves Crass Prostitutes of Brixton {Most-ly Lesbians) \u2014 commonly shortened to C PB( ML) \u2014 have been\noffering their services to\nI.C. professors and senior lecturers.\nThey have had especial success in enticing\nEmetical Engineering\nstaff to their \" personal tutorials\". The E.E. de partment is well-known\nfor its strong belief in Associated Studies, and the professors have been\nkeenly subscribing to the\nFrench lessons that the C PB( ML) offers.\nThe organisation caters for the staff of every\ndepartment of Improbable College. A new group who operate in plastic imitation suede and leather garments is\nhaving great success with Chimp is try profs.\nOnce the C PB( ML) Call-Girls have seduced the profs, they use techniques acquired of their\nspecial training school in\nAlbania to extract top-secret classified examination questions from the profs.\nI traced the heir arch y of the organisation back\nto \" Madame\", the ruth-less, fearless Godmother of the C PB( ML). Her name is Madame Shillong. She operates\nfrom a stunning, a we inspiring and quite\nfrightfully ghastly neo Betjeman residence in\nKing's Stile, W.S.007^.

Annual union\nexpenditure is at present\nof the order of \u00a341,000,\nthe difference being made\ngood by income from the\nbookshop and union in vestments (all in British\nSavings Bonds).\nThe Committee has\ngiven a generous rise of\n\u00a3100 on the Union's demand for \u00a34,900. But news this week throws a shadow of doubt on whether or not the \u00a35,000 will\nbe forthcoming.\nGOVERNMENT BLOCK Queen Mary College\nand Royal Holloway College Unions both colleges\nwithin the University of\nLondon, also put in for\nUnion fee increases this\nterm.\nHowever, the colleges\nreferred the increases to\nthe Universities Grants\nCommittee, for guidance\non how the freeze would\naffect their paying an in crease to the Union.

FELIX Editor censured\u2014\nbut resignation bid fails\nOKver Dowson, Editor of FELIX, was \"severely censured\" for \"his part in the\nprinting of the rag mags\" at last Monday'sI.C. Union Council Meeting. The censure motion followed discussion of a paper prepared by Chemistry Department\nrepresentative and Rag Mag editor Michael Williams.\nAn amendment, tabled by Paul Jowitt, Deputy President of 1.C Union calling for Mr. Dowson's resignation as FELIX editor over the issue was defeated, but\nnot before Mr. Jowitt had succeeded in dragging numerous parts of Mr. Dowson's private life into the\nargument. Many at the meeting delighted in these\nexposes, as Mr. Dowson willingly replied to all the\nalle\u00bbat ions. Council also mandated\nMr. Dowson to print the\n\"discussion document\"\ncontaining allegations\nagainst himself on the\nfront page of this issue of\nFelix. Many further alle-gat ions, including charges\nof corruption, bribery and\ndishonesty were levelled\nagainst Mr. Dowson at the\nmeeting.\nMr. Dowson told a Felix reporter after the meeting that the majority of\nthe allegations were \"com-ple te fabrications\". He said that he had been expecting a censure motion\nall year \"as any sabbatical\nofficer\u2014especially in the\nfirst year of a new sabbatical post \u2014 probably\ndoes\" but more for his\nhandling of FELIX, \"es-pec i ally political issues\"\nthan for this.\n\"It can only be described as a witch unt,\" he\nsaid. \"Some members of\nCouncil, eager to injure\nme in any way possible,\nseized upon this opportunity to implicate me as\nhaving made nefarious\ndeals that served to injure\nthe Union, and to pry out\nmany details of my private life that are no concern of theirs\".\nPaul Jowitt, in a letter\n'a polo gi sing' to Mr. Dowson the next day, described the. meeting as .a \"bar-bari c ordeal\". In conversation, he. asked Mr. Dowson to appreciate the\n\"necessity\" of his actions.\nTalking to FELIX, Mr. Dowson said that he had\nexpected and knew that\ncertain facts would have\nto be discussed at some\ntime. \" But1 fail to see the\nnecessity of discussing\ncertain of the matters\ntouched on, certainly not\nat an open Council meet-ing.\"\nMr. Dowson said that\nthe action of Council, of\nwhom the Publications\nBoard is a sub-committee,\nin mandating him to publish a self-defamatory\ndocument, placed him in\n\" an invidious position\".\nHe was dubious about\nthe second part of the\nmotion, which required\nhim to print \"something\"\nin this issue of FELIX \"to make the facts as plain\nas possible\". Council subsequently decided, that\n\"something\" should be\ndone about the document\nbelow which was discussed\nat the meeting. \" A document which in my opinion\nmisrepresents the facts,\nand only presents them\nfrom one angle, can hardly be termed as 'some-thing' which makes the\nfacts as plain as possible\",\nsaid Mr. Dowson, \"especially when its allegations\nare potentially libellous\".\nHe did however state\nthat, by comparison with\nthe allegations in the\ndocument, those made at\nthe meeting were quite\nludicrous. He specifically\nreferred to the arguments\nused by Mr. Jowitt in his\ncall for his resignation.\n\" The suggestion that I 'rigged' the printing contract for FELIX with the\nprinters in order to gain\nfinancial reward for myself is absolutely untrue.\nIt is a shocking allegation to make. Action of\nthis nature on my part\nwould constitute fraud\"\nhe went on.\n. The only commission\nhe received on print he\nhad got for ICU was on\nsome Ents Committee\nposters, he said, and this\nhad been passed on to the\nUnion.\nThe discussion document which specifically\nrefers to Mr. Dowson's alleged mishandling of the\nprinting of the .rag mags,\nis reproduced below.\nDISCUSSION PROPOSED by Mike J. L. Williams SUBJECT: Ollie Dow son and his handling of the Rag Mags. It is with regret that I bring this topic to the attention of Council. Too many times in the past year I've given Dow son the benefit of the doubt but now the ridiculous state of affairs concerning the Rag Mags simply CANNOT go on any longer. The job of editing the Rag Mag was given tome and Mr. M. Moloney in June last year. By the end of the BtjA\ntwo weeks of the next session, the Rag Mag was complete. Dow son had already been approached by my co editor In\nJune so it was just a matter of seeing him, ironing out minor problems and getting it printed. This was done exactly one week later. It was now three weeks into the session and our job was completed. The jokes and written mater if.l now only had to be typed out and sent to the printers, which Dow son cheerfully offered to do. As far as we were concerned, the Rag Mags would arrive in about three weeks time( six weeks into the term).S of ar so good. But then came a setback. It appears that Dow son fell ill and couldn't type the material out in time to get it to the printers( he omitted to in for many one about his illness). The printers received the copy three days late by which time, it appears, they had received a nH.M. S.O. contract, for six million copies of the highway code.'. Along delay was naturally expected and so D pw son was persuaded to change the printers toRo neo. Vickers where the man concerned was Mr. Tony Rogers. Mr. Rogers received only a small part of the Rag Mag with no written material, although Dow son led people to believe that he had received all the copy and would print in a few weeks. By now it was the end of term and many people were understandably very upset at the non arrival of the Rag Mags. But surely, I thought, if Dow son had been telling the truth, the Rag Mags( now ostensibly in the hands of Mr. Rogers) would arrive by the beginning of the2 nd tern. The2 nd term arrived and no Rag Mags did. It was a! this point Dow son's blatant un cooperation was becoming very noticeable. I continually pressed, badgered and pleaded with Dow son about the Rag Mags.I always got the same reply:\" Just give it a few weeks and they' ll turn up. I'll give Mr. Rogers a ring sometime and see what the holdup is\". This dialogue occurred many, many times throughout the second term.Ina last ditch effort to get Dow son moving, I threatened him with exposure to the Daily Express' Action Line.( It is perhaps fortunate that Dow son doesn't read the' Express' because the Action Line department has n't been functioning for sometime now). Still, it got Dow son moving. He contacted Tony Rogers and later gave me the explanation that there had been some sort of mix up and Tony Rogers was apparently still waiting for the rest of the written material which Dow son had omitted to send him. Dow son thus admitted having some( if not all) of the written material still in his possession. Dow son assured meth a the would type out the rest of it( thus admitting that there was still some typing to do \u2014 even after previous assurances of the imminent arrival of the Rag Mags). It was at the next to last I.C.U. Council of the2 nd term that Dow son told meth a the had finally sent in the last lot of typed out material to Tony Rogers. At last! At last! I thought, it's finally happened. But that assurance turned out to be as worthless as the rest. At the end of the2 nd term, still nothing had happened. It was now the Easter vacation, which, un surprisingly. Dow son spent in Ireland where I could not reach him. Sousing the phone number1 had managed to squeeze out of him( he was extremely reluctant to give it) I eventually contacted Mr. Tony Rogers. I say\" eventually\" because the number only connected me to Ro neo Vickers main office.\nI obtained Mr. Rogers' correct phone number by writing him a letter c/o that main office. In that letter I asked him why no Rag Mags had arrived. He replied by phone that he STILL had n't received the final material from Dow son. He said that he, also, had had great difficulty in contacting Dow son and expressed a feeling of contempt for the attitude of our Felix editor in his business methods. So we approach the end of this saga of frustrated attempts to obtain aRag Mag.I asked Tony Rogers to send me all that he had of the copy in the hope that if there was only a few things missing, I could supplement it, return it. and finally get aRag Mag. The sole contents of the folder he sent me was: the cover, the route map, a few pinups( obtained from the offices of the Daily Mirror) and a few notes on printing specifications. Missing were: all the jokes, cartoons, the crossword, photographs, artwork, features, advertisements and credits. On Monday8 th May Is aw Dow son in the I.C. Union office\nwhere I asked him where the rest of the copy was. He said that he still had it at home. I asked him to bring it in the following day and he agreed to do this. At the time of writing he still has n't. In conclusion I'd like to refer to the last Council meeting( Min.No.998)w here Dow son said that he would do all in his;\npower to get the Rag Mags here knowing all along that they couldn't possibly come while he still had most of the copy. RECOMMENDATIONS: iI. C.U. Council severely censures Mr. O.F. Dow son, for has\npart in tl he handling of the printing of the Rag Mags.i iI. C.U. Council mandates the Editor of Felix to print something in the next available edition to make the facts as plain as possible( The\" something\" referred to should be discussed by Council).^ y^ WILLIAMS Chemistry Department Rep.

Having said that, where are\nthe arguments to refute it? It's no\nuse trying to argue on the basis of\nthe mass-media, etc. All change in\nsociety results from grass root level,\nso as an IC community member, I would like to examine some aspects\nof our community, that of Imperial\nCollege.\nI remember one of the sabbatical\npost candidates at the Hustings (the\nlast ones!) saying that there were no towels or soap dispensers in the\nUnion Building and trying to make\nslight political (small 'p') meat out\nof it. I 'll add fuel to his fire; at the\nmoment there are no society name-blocks for the Unon notice boards,\none broken window in the Bot. Zoo.\ncommon rom, one broken window in\nthe Union Arch Messengers office,\n2 broken glasses on the pinball mac hines in a week, about a10 per cent\nloss of the pewter tankards in the\nUnion Bar, and someone has stolen\nthe T.V. aerial in the Union Building.\nGreat. Hilarious. Of course Southside\nisn't exactly much better, resembling\na glorified dos s house. No longer is\nit the \" nice\" bar in college, but a place of diminishing character, style\nand whatever. I can see someone\nsaying soon that it's because\nthe facilities aren't maintained.\nAll that means, is some silly as s( sup-posed ly the Deputy President) running round after everyone else cleaning up the shit they make. Sorry\nbrothers, but that's not on. Apart\nfrom anything else, it's getting slightly expensive.\nTo be fair, I have been one of the\nmain protagonists of the theory that\nthe number of \" outsiders\" attracted\nby Ents events doesn't help. I still\nhold to that. However, I do not feel\nthe student body as a whole isn't innocent of the whole affair. Of course the student body in general\nand N.U.S. in particular has been\nchampioning the right of the in divi du al. It's a pity that we as a body didn't. think of the rights of the body\nitself. We open our doors to more\nor less anyone and wonder why the\nplace is getting fouled up. It's all in\nthe cause of freedom of the in divi dual or socialism or something. What price now the idea that the Union should be outward-looking? Defeatism fn the face of internal problems?\nFELIX cm\n\u2022on\n^ H3N AT \u2022z. Here's our new Felix cat motif. For five years now the \"crusading cat\" has\nbeen our logo. He was a strange character, tacking both a tail and whiskers\n\u2014 so, knowing feline anatomy, you'll appreciate he never stood much chance\nof finding any direction.\nThe new device, drawn especially for FELIX by Nigel Racine-Jaques,\ndepicts a fully-be whiskered and tailed cat, displaying the mascots of IC's3 constituent colleges: a Celsius/Kelvin thermometer for RCS, a singularly\nuseless equal-ended spanner for Guilds', and an equally useless (since it has\nno screw or lighting device) Davy Lamp for Mines.\nWith the new device comes the promised new page one banner. The one\nintroduced in October last year met with a mixed reception, and the contents\nof the \"box\", originally intended for an advertisement has been used for\nvarious debatable messages. This box has now gone.\nWe hope you approve of the changes. Write and tell us what you think.\nxx*xx x*xxx** XX*X*X X**XX*X XXX**X X*XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXX XXX The \" opening\" of the bar to women is not in itself a bad thing. It's just\nthe men they bring along! You see, there's a difference between I.C. women and their boyfriends and any old women and the\nboys they bring along. The former\ncome, the latter don't.( Tell me, tell\nme. P.W. J., how many hoppers did you see today?). But, it's not just out-side rs, we basically don't care, because we know (I hope) somebody else will pay. Rarely do the mass of\nstudents get together and sling out,\nor keep out troublemakers. It'sal most as if we condone the damage\nand vandalism, or even participate in\nit. Well if that's the \" mandate\" the\nDeputy President has, he can hardly\nbe accused of allowing the Union and Southside to attain \" equilibrium\". By the way, the society name-blocks, T.V. aerial, towels, soap, etc.\nwill all be replaced after term has\nfinished, ready for next year's fresh-ers. I just hope they appreciate it, because looking back on this year, quite\nhonestly, we didn't. For God's sake,\nI.C., respect and take care of what\nwe' ve got, it's no use saying if we had better facilities, we would look\nafter it, because that is patently not\nthe case. Gone are the days of a good piss-up, good sing song, in the\nUnion Bar and no damage, with\nSouthside a place for people wanting\na good, not rowdy bar. Here are\nthe days of a lousy piss-up, lousy\nsing-song, leaving the Union in a mess, with Southside a human jungle,\noccasional lousy sing-song and dos s house.\nCheers, but where?\nPaul Jowitt.\nDep. Pres.\nMaintenance-man in chief.\nbut not General Dogsbody or Chief\nCook and Bottlewasher.\nP.S.I 've heard talk of turning the\nD.P. role into a more political one.\nI'm in two minds whether to be in\nfavour (Defeatism) or to contract an\nulcer (Extremely justified pessimism). With all this talk of the environment I'm just waiting for someone to cotton on. Thi is your en v iron ment, OURS; we want control of it,\nand that means control it ourselves,\nand that means ( DoI have to spell\nit out?) S.E.L.F. C.O.N.T.R.O.L.

    "content": "30th May, 1973 FELIX Page 7\nCHICKEN FEED\n\u2014and what the NUS( and ICU) proposes to do about it\nOn Saturday representatives of 600,000 stu-dents, members of 600 student unions, will\ndescend on Imperial College for the NUS Extraordinary Conference on Grants.\nThe Conference, called by the Easter National Conference at Exeter, has to decide what action the NUS\nshould now take in view of the recent government\naward of a flat \u00a320 increase in the mandatory grant\nlevel, and reductions in parental contributions for\nparents with \"residual income\" of less than \u00a31,900.\nThe Government offer\nrepresents only 20 per\ncent of the increase demanded by the National\nUnion of Students, and\nother demands have been\ncompletely ignored.\n1. No action has been\ntaken on discretionary\nawards. These are the\ngrants paid to students at,\nfor example, technical colleges and colleges of further education and, unlike\nthose paid to university and\npolytechnic students, have\nno fixed level. The amount\nof grant paid is left to the\n\"d is re tion\" of the local\neducation authority, and is\nthus almost always very\nmuch less than the mandatory level. The usual\nparental contribution sale\napplies.\nSince students on discretionary awards have been\namong the most active in the grants campaign that\nhas been running since December, the lack of government reaction to this demand has come as a severe blow to NUS hopes.\nThe conference will certainly be as angry as students on discretionary\nawards, and this claim will\nalmost certainly now come\ntop of the list of next year's demands.\nEaster conference did\nmandate the NUS Executive not to accept any increase in the mandatory\nlevel of grants until discretionary awards are abo-is he d. However, the NUS will have its work cut out\nif it is to try and persuade\n.students to send back their\n\u00a320 increase.\n2. Abolition of the\nmeans test. All the Government has actually done is\nabolish contributions for\nparents with residual incomes less than \u00a31,500,\nand reduce them for in comes less than \u00a31,900. No signs at all have been\nforthcoming of the abolition of parental contributions and with it the means\ntest.\n3. Married women's grants. Although Norman\nSt. John Stevas said earlier\nthis year that he was \"sym-pathetic\" to the case of\nmarried women students\u2014\nthey get only \u00a3275 \u2014 all\n\u2022he has done for them is\naward them the flat \u00a320\nincrease that other, single,\nstudents are getting.\nThe mood of the conference is bound to be\nangry. It opens on the\nmorning of Saturday, 9th June, in our very own\nGreat Hall, which Council agreed to pay for as\nICU's contribution towards the cost of the con-ference. It, will be fully\ncovered in FELIX on\nTuesday, June 12th, with\ninformed comment from\nleading NUS policy ana-lys t s.IC Union has submitted\nits own motion for the\nconference. This \u2014 it is\nreproduced below \u2014 will\nbe \"composite d\" with motions from other colleges\nall over Britain, at a meeting in London on\nJune 7th, and a giant\ncatholic motion presented\nto conference on the 9th. So, herewith, the text of\nICU's motion: \u2014\nMotion on Grants of\nImperial College Union\nfor the NUS Emergency\nConference of June 1973\nA. CONFERENCE NOTES1. The Government's decision of 15th May to\nincrease grants by \u00a320\nnext year in addition\nto the \u00a320 decided in\n1971, and the raising\nof the floor of the\nmeans test to \u00a31500 a year parental income.\n2. The lack of any attempt to remove the\nbasic injustices of the\ngrants system, i.e., discretionary awards, discrimination against\nmarried women, no\nLondon allowance for\npost-graduates, and\nthe means test.\n3. The complete lack of\nany move to introduce\nfull cash grants in colleges of education.\n4. The continuation of\nthe full mandatory\nrate at an amount far\nbelow that adequate\nfor a decent standard\nof living.\n5. That the Government\nannouncement in no\nway meets our demands\nfrom the Exeter Conference.\n6. That given the rate of\ninflation since the last\ntriennial review, the\n\"new\" rates, far from\nrepresenting a step towards our claim, reinforces the present situation and perpetuates\nit.\n7. The recent victim is a tion and threatened\ncourt action against\nrent strikers, e.g., jr\u00ab\nReading University, j8. That post-graduates\nare the only section of\nstudents and University staff not to receive\na London Weighting\nto cover the undisputed higher cost of living\nin London. Also for\npost-graduates in gen-era l, the increase of\n\u00a320, amounting to\nonly 38pa week, postgraduates having to\nlive for 52 on their\ngrants.\nB. POLICY AND CAMPAIGN1. Conference therefore\nentirely rejects the\nGovernment \" offer\" %\nIt sees no basis whatsoever to discontinue\nor dilute our campaign\nfor \u00a3105 increase and\nfull grants for all in\nfull time higher e duca tion.\n2. Conference, however,\nsees no point in instructing members not\nto take any extra\nmoney due to them.\nThis is impractical.\n3. Conference, however,\nbelieves that whereas\nwell argued memos\nfrom NUS were ig-no red, militant action\nby the mass of students has forced an\ninterim review and\nwon some concessions.\n4. May 21st should not\nbe regarded as the last\npossible day by which\nthe Government can\ndecide to meet the\nNUS claim since\nmoney can always\ncome from the central\ngovernment funds instead of LEA's. In\nparticular, since PG\ngrants come direct\nfrom central government funds the excuse\nof LEA and parliamentary bureaucracy\nis even less valid.\n5. NUS should maintain\nand defend the cam-pai gn,e. g., rent strikes\nthis term and rapidly\nextend it, right from\nthe start of Autumn\nterm.\n6. NUS and CO's should\nuse the summer vacation for organisation\nand preparation of explanatory campaign\nmaterial aimed at\nfirst year students utilising fresher s fairs,\nnew students mailings,\nNUS introductory\nmaterial.\n7. In particular, much\nmore emphasis should\nbe put on explaining\nthe evils of discretionary awards to all stu-dents.\n8. National Demonstrations and a Day of Action should be organised in England, Ireland, Scotland and\nWales on the same\nThursday in October.\nThese should aim to\nunite the different sees\nt ions of the campaign\nin a massive lift-off at\nthe beginning of term.\n9. The campaign should\nemploy all the tactics\nsuccessfully employed\nto date \u2014 namely,\ncatering boycotts, pick-ets, lobbies, publicity\ncampaigns, occupations, strikes; to be\nbacked up by and extended from the national demonstration\nin a co-ordinated way.\n10. NUS Executive should\nnot participate in the\nTriennial Review next\nyear unless the Government indicates that\nall the Campaign's demands will be con-side red.11. The particularly acute\nproblems faced by\npost grads should be\ngiven more emphasis,\nbut this requires organisation of PG's at\nboth college and national level. NUS\nExec, should convene\na conference of PG affairs officers and activists to elect a National PG Committee, initiate action on grants\nincluding demonstrating boycotts, lobbies\nand other activities.\nAlthough PG's should\nbe organised by student unions we should\nwork for good relation with AST MS\ngroups where these\nexist.\n12. Students must give\ngreater priority to\nseeking support from\nthe labour movement;\nwho face the same\nenemy in their fight\nagainst wage freeze\nand anti-union legis la tion. We must seek\nmore than verbal support but joint actions,\nleafleting, pickets, demonstrations in sup\u2022 port of higher grants,\nto this end NUS Executive should prepare\n\"An Appeal to the\nLabour Mo ve ment which would present\nthe students' case,\nhighlight discrimination against the working class and further\neducation and ask for\nsupport for some concrete campaigning activity with local student union. Unions\ncould then approach\nin a co-ordinated way,\nTrade Councils, Trade\nUnion .branches, shop\nstewards, committees\nto organise joint ac-t ions. To launch^ this\naspect of the comp a ign there should be a \"Na-t ional Week of Explanation\" of the issue of\ngrants to the working\nclass. Also NUS\nshould organise, on a national scale a conference to organise\nstudents' support in\nthe event of a large\nworkers' struggle against the Pay Laws\nand the government\n(e.g. over the engineers'\nclaim).\n13. Conference believes\nthat more emphasis\nshould be put on explaining that the problems of inflation faced\nby students are shared\nby workers, Old Age\nPensioners, etc.A and\nthat the Government\nmust bear responsibility for this inflation,\ne.g. land speculation,\ncut-backs in social\nservices, VAT, agricultural policy, floating the pound. The effects of low grants, the\nmeans test, and the\ndiscretionary awards\nsystem in ex lu ding working class children from sig her education should be\nstressed more with a view to winning working class support.\nWorkers are finding\nthat due to inflation\ntheir nominal increase\nin income has led to\nan increase in parental\ncontribution despite\napparent changes in\nrate.\n14. Conference recognises\nthat we are very limited in our influence on\nthe Press and that a campaign geared to\nwinning over the mass\nmedia has serious in-a de qua cie s.15. Conference believes\nthat active ant f automatic support by the\nNUS Exec, to all rent\nstrikes, teaching or\ncatering boycotts, oc-cup at ions, democratically decided on by\nCO's in the context of\nthis campaign, is essential for this cam-pa ign.16. Conference calls on all\nCO's to immediately\nreport to Exec, any\nsuch actions and calls\nfor a weekly list of all\nsuch activities to be\ndistributed to all CO's.17. Since this Conference\nhas been called in accordance with Exeter\nConference policy,\nwhich called for decisions on the basis of\nUnion mandates, this\nconference must not\nretreat from any previous policies unless\nsuch mandates have\nbeen given.\n18. Conference affirms the\nExeter decision that\nthe Grants campaign\nwould be maintained\nuntil discretionary\nawards had been abo-li she d.C. RENT STRIKES1. Conference recognises\nthe key role being\nplayed in the Campaign by those colleges\non rent strikes. Conference calls for the\ncontinuation of rent\nstrike activity until our\nclaim is met.\n2. Conference deplores\nthe threats of victim is ation( legal and aca-demi c) used by VC's and Principals in their\nattacks on rent strikes.\n3. Conference believes\nthat the best way to\ncounter such threats of\nis to fight them on our\nown ground, in the col-leg es, Conference un\u2022 equivocally supports\nall actions such as partial or total, short or\nmedium-term occupations, as a means to\ncounter such threats.\nIn this respect Conference wholeheartedly\ncongratulates those\ncolleges which have\nalready embarked on\nsuch action; the successful defence of rent\nstrikes is a tremendous\nachievement for the\nwhole campaign. Any\nsuccessful action, such\nas that at Bristol University, gives incalculable encouragement to\nothers and must be\npublicised as widely as\npossible.\n4. Conference recognises\nthat the law does not\nautomatically attack\nstudents active in the\ncampaign but has to\nbe used by College au-thor i ties, etc. Further\nConference believes\nthat the decisions of\nthe courts will be influenced primarily outside the courts rather\nthan by legal arguments; therefore i. In\nthe face of legal\nthreats NUS and CO's should firstly take\nwidespread action\naimed at discouraging\nthe College Authorities from using the law.\nii. If cases do get to\nthe court then hearings\nshould be accompanied by massive nationally organised\naction.\nD. INSTRUCTIONS1. To Exec, GCCC,\nCO's, AreasH To continue the campaign\nfor our demands as expressed at Exeter.\n2. To Exec.: To organise\nnational demonstrations and a Day of\nAction as outlined in\nPolicy 8.\n3. To CO's: To continue\nall the local action\ntaken to date such as\ncanteen boycotts, oc-cup at ions, etc.\n4. To Exec.: Not to participate in the Triennial review next year\nunless the government\nindicates that all the\ncampaign's demands\nwill be considered.\n5.
