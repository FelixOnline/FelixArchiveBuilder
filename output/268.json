    "content": "10 FELIX 27 November 1968\nSPORTS NEWS EPIC WINS EDITORIAL One of the happiest men in I.C. last Wednesday must\nhave been John Ballard, the Rugby captain, following the\n1st XV's very good win in the Gutteridge Cup 1st Round.\nAll has not gone well with the 1st XV this year, but\nnow, after much hard work, John really has a team in the\nfull sense of the word. With luck (often elusive) and\nbarring too many injuries, they are going to be a good team\nto beat.\nWith the Hockey team too, pulling off a similar\nachievement, the Boat Club winning their first (of many ?)\nregatta, and the Soccer Club making steady progress, we\nlook set for another good sport year for I.C. Would the captains of the smaller clubs too, please\ncontribute to this page. The next copy date in Tuesday,\n3rd December.\nGOOD RECORD\nFOR R.C.S. RUGBY\nThis season is progressing\nwell for the RCS Rugby\nClub, but there is still plenty\nof room for improvement.\nThe second team, the\n\" Tankards,\" under the\ncaptaincy of Dai Simms, are\non the brink of their finest\nseason in living memory;\nwith a record of five matches\nwon and one lost, 89 points\nscored against 28, and reserves clam our ing for games,\nthey have no worries at all.\nThe first team, with 12\nold lags returning, looked\ngood on paper at the start\nof the season, but when the\nbest combination had been\nevolved, two players, Mike\nAdams and Roy Anderson,\nwon places in the IC 1st XV and were lost from RCS.\nHowever their replacements\nhave performed nobly and\nthe first team record so far\nis four matches won, one\ndrawn and two lost, with\n171 points scored against 49.\nKIP CONNOLLY I.C. IN\nCONTROL\nGUTTERIDGE CUP Imperial College 38 pts.\nNorthern Poly 0.\nAs the score suggests I.C. had quite a field day in their\nfirst round Cup match\n(U.L. U.) against Northern\nPoly last Wednesday.\nIn perfect conditions I.C. got straight into their stride\nfrom the kick off, and they\nscored almost immediately\nthrough Keith Heaton on\nthe left wing after a multi-handling move. Bob Pine\nconverted from the touch\nline. Then came an avalanche of tries and points to\nput I.C.21 pts. up after 16\nminutes. The whole game\nrevolved around the domination of the I.C. hard boys\n\" up front\" who gave the\nbacks almost immaculate\npossession from both set\nand loose play.\nThe ample possession became an embarrassment to\nI.C. and by half time one\nand all were exhausted with\ntheir own attacking and the\nscore had only been increased to 27-0. With such\na high score it is impossible\nto pick out the individual\nscorers, but it was good to\nsee plenty of tries coming\nfrom the threes.\nI.C. started the second\nhalf lethargically (and. st ifl exhausted) and managed to\nscore only 3 more tries by\nfull time. It would be\nchurlish to criticise them for\na weak second half bearing\nin mind what they already\nhad under their belts; sufficient to say it wasn't as good\nas the first half.\nOne must mention the\ncaptain, John Ballard, who\nmanaged three tries, and\nonce again the pack, who\nwere magnificent.\nTeam : J. Wild, K. Devaney, R. Anderson, J. Ballard, K. Heaton, R. Pine,\nR. Weisner, G. Widelski,\nP. Cox, B. Sullivan, A. Duke, A. Vickerstaff, M. Dodson, S. Simpson, M. Adams.\nL.S.E.3 I.C.4I. C.1st( XI) (Soccer)\nvisited L.S.E. on Wednesday to complete the first\nhalf of the league pro-gram me. As three of the\nlast four games had resulted\nin one-all draws it was\nhoped that a change of\nteam formation could produce a goal-scoring forward line.\nIn the early stages, the\nI.C. defence was rather\nuncertain, not surprisingly,\nperhaps, due to the new\nformation, and the L.S.E. forwards were quick to exploit this and take an early\nlead. The I.C. XI soon\ndrew level, however, with a fine goal from D. King, but\nslack defensive covering let\nin L.S.E. for their second\ngoal. By this time the midfield players were taking\ncontrol and the L.S.E. defence was put under some\npressure, so that T. Mc Cardle was able to take\nadvantage of a defensive\nerror and equalise. Shortly\nbefore a half-time, I.C. were\nawarded a penalty and R. Dixon made no mistake.\nThe game continued in the\nsame pattern in the second\nhalf with the I.C. defence\nnot playing as well as usual,\nbut managing to contain the\nL.S.E. forwards. I.C. used\nthe wind to their advantage\nand T. McCardle picked up a long clearance from M. Davies, in goal, to score a fourth goal. About a quarter of an hour from time,\nL.S.E. scored while the I.C. goalkeeper was injured but\nthey never looked as though\nthey would gain control and\nI.C. were quite content to\nplay defensively until the\nfinal whistle.\nJ. Darley.\nTECH. CUP Mines 3. Guilds 8\nGuilds began their defence of the Technicians\nCup with a very comfortable win over Mines. After\nfive minutes, Wallace\nopened the scoring for\nGuilds with a penalty, and\ncontinuous Guilds pressure\nresulted, in Squire (2) and\nMcCardle adding further\ngoals for Guilds before the\ninterval. Moon scored\nMines solitary goal in the\nfirst half, after some slackness in the Guilds defence.\nGuilds not unnaturally,\ntook things easier in the\nsecond half. McCardle.\nKeir and Coldwell adding\nfurther goals for them.\nMoon for Mines completed\na personal hat-trick to make\nthe final score: Guilds 8,\nMines 3. This was a good\ndisplay by Guilds, although\nR.C.S. should prove\ntougher opposition.\nGUILDS'7s Held at Harlington on\nSunday. Chem. Eng.

U. Cup l?t round\nI.C.6: Bedford College 0\nI.C. fielded a strong side\nagainst Bedford last Wednesday, with very positive\nresults. After 5 minutes I.C. opened the scoring with a clever goal by Tasney, which\nwas immediately followed\nby a rocket of a goal after a short corner from Ray\nPhillips.\nThe final goal of the first\nhalf was scored from the\npenalty spot after I.C's right winger had been rugby\ntackled in the goal mouth.\nI.C.'s defence was never\nin any difficulty and with\nextra support from the half\nbacks I.C.'s forwards could\nhardly fail to score more\ngoals. The fourth came\nafter a fine solo effort by\nTasney, who was having a fine game at inside right.\nThe service from both wingers was first class and more\ngoals might have been\nscored if their crosses had\nbeen better utilised by the\n3 inside forwards.\nHowever more goals came\nfor I.C. following amel6 e in\nthe Bedford goal mouth; Sargeant scored from close\nin. The final goal came\nafter some fine work down\nthe right side of the field.\nIan Tasney deservedly\nscored his 3rd and I.C.'s6 th goal.\nSo I.C. go into the second\nround to play as yet unknown opponents in early\nDecember.\nTEAM: Townsey, Burtt,\nComyn, Sargeant, Hill,\nPhillips, Manning, Tasney,\nPratt, Ringrose and Rodger.\nNARROW WIN\nIN REGATTA The winter term is always\none for hard work, cold\nweather and very gradual\nimprovement for the Boat\nClub, interspersed with only\none or two regattas to\nbrighten it up. Saturday,\n16th November was one of\nthese occasions and the club\nentered the event of Junior\nLightweight Eights in the\nRegatta organised by Vesta\nRowing Club. The crew\nconsisted mainly of oarsmen who began rowing\nwith I.

The competition proved better than\nexpected and although our\ncrew led Bedford from start\nto finish, they were pressed\nhard by a typically tenacious schoolboy crew and\nwon by | length. The final\nproved even more difficult\nand in this race I.C. were\nled by Stratford for most of\nthe race and were trailing\nby a whole length at one\nstage. However, it was our\nturn to fight back and with\nsome good steering by Beck\nover our home course\u2014\u2022\nalmost the same as. that\nused for the Lowry race\n\u2014the crew drew up level\nwith 20 strokes to go ,and\nmanaged to win by 3 feet.,'\nIn the past three years,\nthe Eoat Club has always\nhad difficulty in winning\nOpen Eights events and it is\nhoped that this victory will\nbe the beginning of a series\nof wins this year in eights.\nOn Saturday is the University of London Winter\nVIIIs regatta, in which four\ncrews from the boat club\nwill be competing and it'\nshould prove a profitable\nday's racing.\nG.W.

The former was\nbrought up despite an overall profit of \u00a34,000 last /session,\nthe reason being that a4 per cent increase in the wages of\nRefectory staff is coming up. The decision whether to\nincrease prices will be made at the next Refectory Committee meeting later this term when Mr. Mooney will be\nable to produce figures as to how demand for meals is going\nthis year. One point which will have to be considered is\nthe advice from the U.G.C. that a decrease in standards is\npreferred to an increase in prices.\nAlthough the price of beer\nwas raised by Id. for the\nSummer term last session,\nthis was either not enough\nor too late to prevent a loss\nof \u00a3610 in the Union bar\nand \u00a3220 in Southside. A suggestion was made that\npart of this loss might be\ndue to an inefficient stock-taker (now replaced) who, it\nwas suggested, counted\nempty bottles. Losses of\nglasses were also reported as\nbeing a source of income\nloss. The decision now rests\nwith the next meeting of the\nrefectory Committee, who\nhave referred the matter to\nthe Wine sub-committee.\nShop Stock\nThe Southside shop also\ncame under discussion. Mr. Moonev is tr vine to arrange\nfor the hours of opening to*\nbe re-arranged to give an extension until 6 p.m. Mr.\nMooney is open to suggestion as to what the shop\nshould stock (no contraceptives!). Under the arrangements\nmade for Refectories when\nthe College Block comes into\nuse the pie and chips Refectory will be replaced by\na similar service in the College Block, open from 10\na.m.8 p.m. The suggestion\nthat a room should be available for a Hall dinner every\nevening was also made.\nThe coffee bar will remain\nopen, and the possibility of\nit being staffed by I. C.W. A. next term is being con-side red. A new milk machine is to\nbe installed on a months free\ntrial at the beginning of\nnext term, in the Union\nsnack bar. The cartons will\nbe filled on insertion of the\ncoin, and it is said to work\nevery time. If it is a success\nit will be bought at a cost of\n\u00a3250, and the present machines will be reconditioned.\nTinkers&Diz\nThe folk club is at the\nmoment enjoying great\npopularity with several well\nknown performers paying\nvisits to I.C.A fortnight ago the\nTinkers appeared and gave\na performance of mostly\ntraditional Irish music. They\nreinforced their act with\nmuch chat and this in combination with a sprinkle of\nEnglish and Scottish songs\nmade their performance\nhighly entertaining.\nThe following week Diz\nDizley appeared. Diz is a great entertainer and is\nguaranteed to get any folk\nclub going. His performance*\nconsisted mainly of traditional, bawdy, English songs\nwhich he interspersed with\njokes in the same vein. Diz\nDizley was ably supported\nby members of I.C. folk\nclub which made the whole\nperformance an enjoyable\none.\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification ?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nLAM LEY'SAM for your\u2014\nBOOKS\n\u00a3 ART MATERIALS\nY PAPER BACKS\n5 STATIONERY\ns1 EXHIBITION ROAD. S.W.7P. P. Arnold in action at Guilds-Mines CarnivaL\nRY.G. MAKES\nA LOSS\nThis years Guilds-Mines\nCarnival made a loss of\nabout \u00a3250 despite a last\nminute publicity campaign.\nOnly 230 tickets were sold\nout of a hoped for 300. This\nis amazing when you consider what good value for\nmoney a Carnival ticket is.\nFor \u00a31 each you get a two\ncourse meal, dancing to at\nleast one \" big name\"\ngroup, as well as several\nsupporting groups, free cof-ee bars and a film.\nThe theme \"Play Your\nGame \" brought out many\ningenious costumes which\nthrew interesting light on\nthe favourite pastimes of\nI.C. students. Inevitably\nrug ger shirts were very\nmuch in evidence but the\nfavourite game appeared to\ninvolve the man wearing\npyjamas and the girl wearing\na night dress! The prize, a bottle of whisky, for the\nmost original costume was\nwon by Graham Blackey\n(Elec. Eng. P.G.) and his\npartner, who were playing\ncroquet.\nThe film shown was\nMamie. Unlike most Carnival films, few people had\nseen it before. On the whole\nthe groups were good although whether you like P.P. Arnold is definitely a mater of taste.\nThose who went to the\nGuilds-Mines Carnival had\na very enjoyable evening but\nit would have been better if\nmore people had been there.\nThings tended to quiet en down when half the people\nwere eating or watching the\nfilm. The success of a carnival depends largely on the\nnumber of people who go.\nSo watch out for the R.C.S. Carnival and come along\nand support it.\nMORADE\nLOBBY\nLast Wednesday, MORADE, the Movement for Rethinking of Art and Design Education, in arched on the\nDepartment of Education and Science and then on to the\nHouses of Parliament to lobby MJ.'s with a view to\ngetting a public enquiry into the state of education at\nGuildford College of Design (ex school of art). A petition\nwas handed in at the D. EJS. and the M.P.S lobbied with\nMORADES views.\nThe loh by was organized\nat a meeting held in this\ncollege un Friday, 15th November. This gathering\ndiscussed t ne situation at\nGuildford as well as the\norganisation and publicity\nof the following Wednesday's lobby. A staff member at Guildford described\nthe predicament of the college and then outlined the\nmany gre iv ances. Grievances\nFollowing the sit-in last\nsummer seven full time and\nthirty part time staff who\nhad supported the students\nwere dismissed. Several important courses were closed\ndown with ob t consultation\nwith either staff or students.\nAfter this the Association of\nTeachers in Technical Institutes blacked the school.\nThe administration (head of\nschool with a small group\nof departmental heads) has\nseemed to adopt a policy of\ndeceive, divide and rule.\nParents and selected staff\nhave had \" meetings \" from\nwhich students were barred.\nNew students are being\nactively discouraged from\n\" getting ideas.\"\nWith these fundamental\neducational issues in mind,\nover .300 demonstrators\nstarted from the Royal Col-;\nleg e of Art on the Wednesday and strolled to the\nD.E.S. in Curzon Street to\nhand a petition in. Speakers\nthere included an informative staff member*, and\nTrevor Fisk, secretary of\nN.U.S., who was not well\nreceived. The marchers left\nfor speakers corner for more\nmilitant speeches, including\na condemnation of Education Minister Short for being\nunable to meet the demon-strat or s': M.P's Agree\nTaking buses to Parliament Square, MORA DE proceeded to lobby M.P.'s who seemed to agree with\nthe idea of a public enquiry\ninto education at Guildford.\nOne M.P. even stated that\nhe was a very radical left\nsupporter \u2014 probably the\nNews of the World would\nlike his name.\nA. A. Appeal\nThe Architectural Association who are projected\nto become I.C.'s4 th constituent college are at the\nmoment in the process of\nraising the \u00a3500,000 necessary to pay for new building that it needs.\nThe lease on their old\nbuilding in Bedford Square\nruns out in eight years but\nthe Government will provide the money for the proposed new site at 191-194\nQueens Gate. A condition\nof them coming under the\nwing of IC. is that they\nshould be able to find the\nmoney to erect a new building on this site. This is also\na condition for the A. A. obtaining a grant from the\nUniversities Grants Committee to cover their running costs.\nAn appeal has been\nlaunched to try and raise\nthis \u00a3500,000, an appeal\nbox office has been set up at\n34-36 Bedford Square, and\ninformation being sent out\nto members of the A. A; throughout the world. Over\n\u00a385,000 has already been\ncollected and they hope to\nget the rest from donations\nfor n* numbers and from\ninstitutions and businesses\nconnected with architecture.\nUNSA Conference\nInternational Relations\nClub sponsored the first\nLondon Region United Nations Students Association\nConference during the\nweekend November 23rd24 th. About 60 delegates\nfrom ten colleges in London attended the confer-en ce, which passed a number of resolutions for consideration at national level\nduring the Annual General\nCouncil of UNSA in Janary.

    "content": "FELIX27 November19689 IN THE YEAR\nOF THE PSG\n\" As soon as I heard of American independence, my\nheart was enlisted \" . . . So said Joseph Alson in 1776 and\nso begins a new film \" In the Year of the Pig \" (Institute\nof Contemporary Art, Thurs., Fri., Sat. and Sunday\u20146.00\np.m. and 8.30 p.m. from Nov. 22nd.) The film traces, with\nmeticulous care, the last forty years of the history of\nVietnam and as such is the only documentation so far to\nappear on the big screen of that woeful saga\u2014unhappily\nnot yet complete.\nAs in all good documentation the story is laid before us\nin two parts\u2014a summary of the recent history of the\ncountry and an insight into the present conflict. The two\ncannot be separated of course, and to his credit director\nEmile de Antonio has sifted through newsreel, old and\ncurrent, interviews with generals, soldiers and journalists\nand public speeches by statesmen of both America and\nVietnam and at no time does he lose a sense of continuity\nor relevance of a scene to what either precedes or follows.\nHo Chi Minh went to Paris in 1917, became a devout\nMarxist and set up a successful left-wing newspaper. This\nwas at a time when most of his countrymen were at the\nyoke of a rickshaw wherein sat French generals or diplo-mats. By 1950 Ho was the natural people's leader throughout most of the country, North and South, and the film\nrightly stresses the attraction which this man had, and still\nhas, over the peasants and workers. Then came General\nGiap's legendary rout of the French at Dien Bien Phu\nwhich was not so much a military victory as a public\nrelations triumph for Ho which had a profound and lasting\neffect on world politics. The wretched division into North\nand South at Geneva in 1954 is well-known but the film\nserves as a useful reminder to those of us who would be\nbarely ten at the time, of the installment, by the Americans\nof a puppet ruler in 1956\u2014the vulnerable President Diem\nwhom President Johnson hailed as \" the Winston Churchill\nof South East Asia.\" There is no doubt that had the\nelections, which the North was calling for, been held, Ho Chi Minn would have swept in and the blocking of this was\nthe Americans' fundamental mistake to which the present\nstrife can be traced. There followed the futile rule of\nDiem who, corrupted by his wife and brother whose lust\nfor power was \" little short of pathological,\" finished his\ndays in the back of al ony: fh his throat cut. And when\nthe American \" military advisors a were sent to \" advise \"\nthe Government of the South it was really a question of\n\" what Government?\"\nThe film's account of the war is done, again, entirely\nthrough interview, in the same light as the previous history.\nTo begin with we have a Senator stating that Kennedy really\nwanted to let the South Vietnamese fight and lose before his\ncountry's involvement reached the present scale. We hear\nthe incredibly misinformed rhetoric of Generals Curtis\nLernay and Mark Clark \u2014 the latter's explanation of\nAmerica's reluctance to invade the North taking the biscuit\n. . . \" We don't want to risk the lives of 100,000 American\nBoys against 100,000 of theirs\u2014y 'know, they don't really\ncare how many they lose.!' We have a sonar operator on\nboard the \" torpedoed \" Maddox stating that as far as his\nequipment could tell there wasn'ta submarine or a torpedo\nin the Gulf of Tonkin at the time! And finally there is\nColonel Patton emotionally recounting the scene in the field\nchapel as the soldiers mourned the loss in battle of some\ncolleagues. \" Their faces were determined but reverent. . .\nand a blood ve ood bunch of killers they are.too! \"\nMany people will see this film and reject its claim to\nbe a documentary feature. Biased,\" \" Anti-American \"\nthey will say. It is unquestionably anti-American and this\npoint was put to the Director\u2014de Antonio\u2014after the show.\n\" How can you remain objective when you see B.52s bombing villages or soldiers mistreating old women?\" was his\nreply. There is the other side of the coin of course\u2014\nbombing embassies, machine-gunning shoppers\u2014which was\nadmittedly omitted from the film. But this simply was\nnot meant to be a film to leave you neutral\u2014even if such\na film could ever be made. If a documentary has the function of \" telling it like it is \" then here is a documentary.\nThere is no narrative\u2014the dialogue is that of Senators,\nstatesmen, reporters, soldiers and historians\u2014and their\nfeelings and sentiments shape our impressions. There are\nno actors no fabrications-\u2014when M.P.s pacify a suspect\nwith a boot in the stomach, he feels it. When Senator\nMpreton describes Ho as the \" George Washington \" of\nVietnam we are simply bearing what he doesn't tell the\nPress and when we see the spirit of the North Vietnamese as\nthey shoot down an American plane or when we hear U.S. soldiers referring to the South Vietnamese as \" slat-eyes \"\nwe simply perceive what Time and Reader's Digest don't print.\nDe Antonio expects difficulty in recouping the $ 111,000\nit cost him to make the film. \" No big companies will touch\nit\" he assured me. And so to anyone w no thinks he knows\nthe whole story, go and see this important film\u2014and see if\nsomewhere there isn'ta slight failure in communication.\nJOHN SPENCE\nrecord\nreview\nThe Incredible String Band.\nWee Tarn and the Big Huge\nElectra E UK74036/37 Everybody seems to be\nproducing double albums\nthese days : the Pentangle,\nth g Beatles, and Jimi Hendrix, to name three.

Morning again - Tom Paxton\nThis is Tom Paxton's4 th L.P. and has been released\nto coincide with his annual\nBritish tour which finishes\non 25th November. In\nother words, hard luck, you\nhave already missed him.\nHowever, Paxton devotees\nwill have heard all the tracks\non this L.P. already as they\nwere his \" new\" songs as\nperformed last year at Cambridge Folk Festival and\nlater on the full scale tour in\nNovember.\nPaxton's popularity is\nbased on the superb atmosphere and professionalism\nof his concert performances,\nand on the beauty and simplicity of his melodies.\nHe always seemed to sound\na little flat and anaemic on\nhis earlier records, where he\nlost his concert atmosphere;\na criticism which can be\nlevelled at many folk\nsingers.\nThis latest L.P. is basically similar to his earlier\nwork, with the major exception that on many tracks he\nhas dropped his solo guitar\nThe Incredible String Band\nin favour of a small backing\ngroup. His melodies are as\ngood as ever, but his style\nhas changed very little; it is\nthe mixture as before, with\norchestral padding. He has\ngrown fatter, balder, and\nmore prosperous and in\ndoing so has lost the sharpness of his first records,\nwithout improving and pro-gres sing. He is stagnant.\nHis protest songs are as\neffective as making love by\npost, and he still cannot do\ntalking blues. I have always\nthought Paxton was better\nwhen doing his intensely personal and beautiful love\nsongs, although here his\nconstant fight with the backing makes even these a little \u2022\ndisturbing. The better\ntracks included \" So much\nfor winning,\" \" Morning\nagain,\" the title track, and\n\"Now that I 've taken my\nlife.\" A good L.P. spoilt by\nbad production; rather dis-appointing.\nFred Neil/Bleaker and\nMacdougal\nElektra EKS7293\n\" If you are very hip and\nvery aware,\" says the hand-out, \" you may just have\nheard the rumbling from\nacross the Atlantic about\nFred Neil.\" I must admit\nthat I don't seem to be hip\nenough, as this L.P. is my\nintroduction to him. Fred\nlives in the Florida orange\ngroves, where he is supported by Tim Buckley and the\nMothers, and isn't involved\nwith the world of showbiz.\nAll but one of the songs\nwere penned by Fred, and\nhave a distinct blues feel.\nPerhaps because of this,\nmost of the material is not\nstrikingly original. He is at\nhis best with slower numbers\nlike \" Blues on the ceiling,\",\n\"Little bit of rain,\" and\n\"Other side to this life,\"\nall of which are very good\nsongs indeed, and suit his\ndeep brown, im men sly relaxed voice. Other songs\nare pleasant enough but\nrather unexceptional, and\nthe harmonica B( by John\nSebastian) while good in it-self, is perhaps overdone.\nThe rollicking \" Travelling\nShoes \" is the one fast number which really comes off.\nParts of this LP are very\ngood and we will probably\nhear a lot more of Fred\nNeil in the future.\nCARNIVAL\nWALK\nDecember\n6th "

    "content": "8 FELIX 27 November 1968\nTHEATRE CENSORSHIP\nOne of the most unpopular of the many jobs held by\nthe Lord Chamberlain used\nto be that of censor of all\nstage productions in this\ncountry. Despite five parliamentary inquiries into whether this post ought to be\nabolished, it was not until\nSeptember that ag over ment passed an act to remove it.\nUnder the Theatres Act\nof 1843 all plays publicly\nstaged in Britain and performed by unpaid actors before paying audiences had\nto have a licence issued by\nthe Lord Chamberlain. By\nthis act he was able to ban\na play or parts of a play as\nlong as he considered it necessary for \" the pre serva ion of good manners, decorum or the public peace \"\nto do so. There was no appeal to his verdict through\neither Parliament or the\nLaw Courts.\nHistory\nThe whole history of directives from the Lord\nChamberlain reflects the\nmoral tone of society at the\nparticular time; thus in\nVictorian times censorship\nwas so strictly enforced that\nCharles Kingsley was forced\nto say \" few highly educated\nmen now think it worthwhile\nto go to see any play . . .\nand still fewer educated men\nthink it worthwhile to write\nplays\"; and in the period\nprior to the abolition the\nposition was relatively free.\nIt must be pointed out, how-ever, that even in times such\nas these, censorship still\nplaced great restrictions on\nwhat could be staged, and\nthus Harold Pinter moved a play from the stage to Radio\n3, where the one word which\nthe Lord Chamberlain\nfound objectionable could be\nspoken.\nFollowing the abolition of\nthe Lord Chamberlain's post\nas censor, the moral welfare\nof the public now rests in its\nown hands. Any person or\ngroup (e.g. local councils)\ncan bring proceedings on\nthe basis of Common Law\non such charges as obscene\nperformances, incitement to\nracial violence and libel.\n(It is perhaps interesting to\nnote that the charge is libel\nrather than slander).

At the Student Residence Committee meeting last\nweek, we were presented with a new and very far reaching\nfu gg est ion. The idea is to increase the number of fresher s! a hall from the present total Of about 25 per cent to a hew figure of over 50 per cent. This has been suggested\nto make life easier for fresher s, who perhaps have\nthe most difficulty in finding good accommodation in\nLondon. However, apart from drastically cutting down the\nchances of other students who want to get into residence,\nthis system could produce very large changes in the pattern\nef life in Hall It was decided not to take any decision\nuntil the beginning of next month, and in the meantime\nwe have agreed to find out what the student opinion is.\nThis change would make a lot of difference to the lives of. a lot of students, so please let us know your views, either\nthrough the Union Office, or through \" Communicate,\" the\nfloor reps meeting on Monday and Friday lunchtimes.\nCarnival is again hoping to break the record total of\nmoney collected, and one profitable event could be the\nAll Night Charity Walk. This is due to start on the evening\nof December 6th, just after the Swimming Gala, with\nwalkers setting out from Richmond, going via Kingston,\nClaygate, Kingston and back to college ending with breakfast in the Union. Many more walkers and sponsors are\nrequired. Anyone who doesn't think I can walk 27 miles is\nwelcome to come and put his money down.\nThe President's Dinner and Dance, the final ball of the\nCollege year, which is free and by invitation only, has again\nbeen criticised by some Council members. It is meant to\nbe a reward for those people who have worked hard for\nthe Union'during the year, but it has been argued that\nit-is a waste of the Union's money. One totally unknown\npiece of information is the attitude of the average Union\nmember, who may well not be personally involved. So once\nagain, all opinions will be very welcome.\nWELLS SOC. GHOSTS\nLast Thursday night, the\nH.G. Wells Society's Ghost\nGrodp held its first meeting\nof the term, on Tizard Hall\nGallery. The speaker was\nGrace Rosher, a well-known \" automatic writing \" medium, who described her apparent ability\nto receive written messages\nby h_r own hand, but in the\nstyles of deceased persons.\nThe evidence in favour ot\nher claim cons is 'ed of a film\nshowing her writing with a pen barely touching only\nthe side of one finger, a professional graphologist's testimony to the effect that the\nmessages she was receiving\ncould only have been written by certain persons, now\nlong deceased ; and an opportunity for members of\nthe audience to compare\nfor themselves samples of\nher messages with samples\nof writing made during the\nlives of the now deceased\n\" communicators.\"\nThe expected hostility in\nthe audience's reaction to\nher claim did not materialise significantly, and she\nseemed to stand up quite\nwell to the questions asked\nafter her talk. Most of the\ndiscussion was relevant to\nthe subject, although the\nconversation of certain\ngroups managed somehow\nto digress to the fallacies of\nquantum mechanics, the\npossibility of forging\ncheques, and whether there\nwas lots of sex in the \"after-life.\" An attempt by one\nnotable sce pti c to perform\nautomatic wr i< ins failed to\nproduce much more than\nthe trails one would expect\nfrom an inky spider; ob-vio us ly, spirit-spiders were\ntrying to get through.\nProbably some of the\nmembers returned home to\nsit hopefully with pens on\npaper; any success should\nbe immediately reported in\nwriting, preferably in the\nmember's own style, to the\nGhost Group. Does this\nphenomenon happen ? It is\nnot for us to say, as we are\nnot in possession of all the\nevidence for and against her\ncase ; however, the evening\nserved its purpose in offering an intriguing case which\nwas worthy of a scientific\nchallenge from sceptical IC\nstudents. Grace Rosher's comment to me afterwards?\n\u2014\" They were very kind,\nand I liked them. They're\na nice bunch.\"\nRadio and Electrical repairs ; rapid and in ex pen sive.

In the allegedly humorous farce Rex, President\nof I.C.U., was found guilty\nof running the Union in a spirit contrary to demo-c racy.

As one former\nDebates President put. it:\" it seemed to succeed in\none major object only, the\nself-glorification of Parker.\"\nV*i They have been telling me\nthe most extraordinary\nthings about the staff in this\ncollege. There is a rumour\nthat South-Side Bar was\nclosed at 9.30 p.m. one\nThursday because five of the\nMech. Eng. staff insisted in\ndoing press-ups there.\nRumours from the green\nand pleasant land of Chem.\nEng. say that-a former stu-dents' common room area\nhas been taken over as a private shower\u2014and that\nthis shower is near to the,\nroom of the Head of Department ! But then Ida ren't print everything I'm told.\nLES EB DON MORADE - The Movement\nfor the Re-thinking of Art and\nDesign Education was formed\nlast summer in the midst of\ndeep-rooted confrontations at\nGuildford and Hornsey art\ncolleges between groups of\nstudents and staff and governing bodies and their administrations. The long term aim\nof MORADE is in its name,\nthe short term activities are\nto collect and disseminate\nideas, promote national dis-cuss ions, co-ordinate and organise events to bring about\nreforms in specific cases where they are needed.\nN.U.S. MORA DE consists of stu-dents, staff (students and staff), artists, designers, education a lists, ordinary people,\ndrawn from many art\nschools and universities, etc.\nNUS also are belatedly supporting Morade (only after\ninitially failing miserably\nto do anything for the\nart college situation them-selves).\nBAD VIBRATIONS\nClash AIMS CONTROL \u2014 To the un-in vw l ved scientist the problems of the art colleges are\nvery complicated. The primary concern of Morade is\nthe continual clash between\norganisational and educational imperatives as manifested in the almost permanent \" bad vibrations \" between the administrators and\neducational rectors of the\nart colleges. It is not possible\nto do good creative work in\nan atmosphere of bad will.\nMorade states that art colleges should be bq sed on\neducational rather than ad-ministration al imperatives.\nThe organisation of a school\nshould be a RESULT of\nthe educational process controlled by the students and staff, NOT imposed on the\nschool by often remote and\nuninformed groups (the\nboards of Governors and\nLEA's who frequently impose their conservative lack\nof ideas onto the art colleges\nas if they v^ ere dealing with\nsecondary schools.)\nMorade is campaigning\nPIERS CORBYN outlines the feelings and activities\nof MORADE, the movement which sprang np from the\neducational ruins of Guildford and Hornsey.\nfor the transfer of financial\nand educational control\nfrom the LEA's to the art\ncolleges themselves, the\nmoney forthcoming by a direct grant system.\nCreativity\nSecondary school education severely subordinates\ncreativity to external authority\u2014syllabuses and exam i nations, etc. Morade be-le ives that G.C.E.' s are often quite irrelevant i as to\nentrance qualifications to\nessentially creative institu'tions like art colleges. For\nthe same reasons Morade\nholds that because a student\non entering art college is untrained in developing his\nown creativity the art school\nmust \"facilitate the transition from imposed to exploratory learning.\" This\ncan only be done if there is\nwC^ Deration between students and teachers (hence\nstudents and staff) and if there\nis free access to many different disciplines in the art\nschool.\nChoice\nMany bureaucratic LEAs and governing bodies (who\noften have a high number of\nmilitary men on them) prefer to install \"linear\"\ncourses of art \" education \"\nrather than allow interdisciplinary studies. More linear\ncourses usually means more\ndiploma courses and hence\na higher status to the school.\nA more or less free choice\nof resources MUST be allowed if the student is to\ndevelop real creativity, so\nMorade believes in the vital\nimportance of Foundations\nCourses and the need for\n\" continuous creation of\ncourses to fit group and in-divi TV jal needs..\"\nMo'ra de believes that because of the subjectivity of\nart. work many assessments\ndo not have the value which\nis often placed in them.\nSociety Art is a reflection of the\nwhole of society so art\nschools must never be dictated to and must never become isolated from their\nsocial environment.\nMethods The methods of Morade\nare all-fold: letter\"writing to\nM.P.s and D.E.S. etc, lobbying (see article), demonstrations, marches in order to\nopen Public Enquiries. In\nthe short term Morade will\nconcentrate on specific issues : for example the appalling situation at Hornsey\n(see last Felix), the staff\ndismissals at Guildford etc.,\netc., the closing of the Foundation Course in the Central School of Art. and so\non.\nAppeal In future Morade needs\nto organise more meetings\nand more lobbies, circulate\nmOr\u00a3 information and promote more discussions in\nnewspapers. For all this\nMorade has issued an appeal to all colleges and universities for \u00a325. The issues\ninvolved are far wider than\nart colleges\u2014they are about\neducation as a whole\u2014what\nhappens in Guildford now\nmay be a precedent to what\ncould happen in any universities in a few years time.\nLook at the problems !

    "content": "4 FELIX 27 November 1968\nIn this issue, Piers Corbyn explains the ideas behind\nMORA DE, the organisation trying to change some of the\ntraditional concepts of Art education. In his last para--graph he says, \" The issues involved are far wider than art\ncolleges\u2014they are about education as a whole\u2014what happens in Guildford now, may well be a precedent to what\ncould happen in any university in a few years time.\" The\nmain issue as I see it is the stifling of creativity, from which\nstems the need for good staff-student relations and for\naccess to different dic ip lines within the art school.\nIs there such a stifling of creativity at Imperial College ? I think it is indisputable that in most departments\nthe syllabus is regarded as the be-all and end-all of University life. This is what the student is given to learn and\nonly this will pass him his exams. Any extra-curricular\nknowledge he may desire to pick up will be of little or no\nuse to him academically and realising this, the majority\nof students do not bother to take an interest in matters outside their immediate field of study. This tends to narrow\nthe mind of student with the result that his overall education suffers. Although there are limited opportunities for\nsome undergraduates to study in various departments-Physics 3rd year options offer courses in Mines, Elec. Eng.\nand Meteorology\u2014on the whole Imperial College tends to\nturn out a person incredibly well versed in one subject but\napathetic about anything else.\nTo generali sea bit more, it is fairly noticeable that\nfew people at this college take an active interest in things\nlike politics or literature. The rudimentary courses in\nthese, and similar non-scientific subjects, that take place\naround college seem to generate a lack of interest in those\nstudents taking them. Few people make any sort of contact\nwith R.C.A. and other local colleges despite the energetic\n(though somewhat unco-ordinated) efforts of the External\nAffairs Committee. Let us hope that the arrival of the\nArchitectural Association at some time in the future will\nhelp broaden the outlook of the I.C. student.\nOn a different plane let's turn to the mindless morons\nwho have an uncontrollable urge to scribble on things. The\nlift in the Union becomes more and more pornographic as\ntime goes on. Repeating the standard joke, it may well\nsoon be appearing in paperback form. Seriously though,\nit doesn't say much for the people at this college if some\nof them seem to spend half their waking lives scribbling\ngraffiti all over the place. This may be creativity of a sort,\nbut . . .\nIn a previous \" Comment,\" we noted that it was about\ntime Southside had a fire drill. We are pleased to see that\none has been arranged.\nX Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel. KEN 2963\nEDITOR; PAUL HEATH\nAsst. Editor: Mary Ford\nNews.

He\nstates, in ex cus ably disjointed English, that the\ntwo persons were injured\nduring Morphy Day vio-len c e.I'm not surprised!\nThe level of intelligence that\ndrives people into a running\nturnip battle, wearing a pair\nof spectacles, is similar to\nthat of many IC students,\nwhose thirst for \" A\" levels\nhas deprived them of acquiring a little common sense.\nAs for the man with the\ncarved-up knee, perhaps I can tell you of my good\nfriend who has just lost a knee-cap through his devotion to sport. In his case\nany different? Both volunteered to \"play.\" Both\nwere injured accidentally. If\nyou really consider that the\nthrowing of squashy pears,\nrotten sprouts and the occasional rigid turnip is a violent pursuit, I feel it my\nduty to warn you against\nthe blood-thirsty, brutal\nEnglish game of rugby,\nwhere casualties are so\nfrequent that one barely has\ntime to write about them.\nFRANK COLD WELL Vice-President. C& GU. Negative Attitudes\nSir,\nI would like to reply to\nyour front page article, edi-to rial, and G. Assimakis'\nletter in the last issue. I realise it was very unfortunate that two people were\nso seriously injured on\nMorphy Day but these were\naccidents like those that\nhappen every day in the\npursuit of sport. A recurrence of these will be prevented as far as possible by\nconsultation between the\ncollege presidents. Other\nthan this I believe that most\npeople who went along had\nan enjoyable afternoon.\nIt seems to me that the\narticle about Morphy Day is\ntypical of the negative attitude taken by FELIX about\nalmost everything that is\nhappening around IC. There\nappears to be little respect\nfor reporting the facts in an\nunbiased form. I certainly\ndid not drink \" a complete\nbottle of whiskey \" on the\nBrighton Run (a half bottle\nis my limit) and to accuse\nthe candidates for Mr.\nICWA and their proposer s of being \" all well lubricated\" on one pint is a gross\ninsult.\nIsn't it about time FELIX started to take a positive attitude to what is going on\nwhich might help arouse\nmore interest. You may\nwell \" love writing drivel\nwith everyone else on\nFELIX to help you,\" but I, for one, don't like reading\nit.\nYours sincerely,\nDER MOTT CORR Fine l de as& Intentions\nDear Sir,\nThe mock trial of Rex\nLowin arranged by Debates\nSoc. was, one supposed, a light-hearted platform from\nwhich the President could\nmake known his serious\npoint of view and the approach he has to I.C. Union.\nA soft-sell for some hard-hitting policies and a good\nidea perhaps.\nIn fact I 've seen funnier\nsketches written by third\nformer s, but that aside, the\nidea evidently was to give\nthe impression that it was all\na jolly good joke to 1am po on Lowin but I.C. Union\nmust be all right really if its\nPresident has such fine ideas\nand good intentions.\nThe ideas Lowin put forward were as unsophisticated as the farce itself:\n\" Communications have improved \" he said. \" Students\ncan now get cut-price insurance \" he added to an\naudience which was staggered to learn this was what\nthe President thought they\nreally wanted. To have the\nPresident \" prosecuted \" by\nsomeone as involved in the\nbureaucracy as Dermott\nCorr is evidence of the de-political nature of the event.\nThere was no mention of\npresidential elections, whether or not to join the NU.S. and the abolition of the constituent college system,\nwhich are hardly revolutionary issues and would only\nbegin to make I.C. Union\ninto a democratic, non-re-action ary institution which\nwas not controlled from the\ntop but structured to encourage student involvement\nand decrease apathy.\nMATTHEW DUNCAN JONES Chairman, Socialist Soc.\nO.S. C. Election\nThe Overseas Student\nCommittee was formed last\nyear as a subcommittee of\nS. C.C. composed of all the\nchairmen of the various\nSocieties on S. C.C. and its\naims were to look after the\ngeneral welfare of the overseas students at I.C. Since the people on it\nwere only ex-officio mem-be rs, the committee was\nhardly representative of the\nmain body of the overseas\nstudents, and its members\nwere little interested in its\naffairs so the committee\nhardly accomplished anything last year.\nThis year it was agreed\nthat the committee should be\ntransferred to the welfare\ncommittee and its members\nwill be elected by an annual\ngeneral meeting of all the\noverseas students.

Parking\nPoints\nDear Sir,\nI should like to clarify\nthe situation concerning the\nlocations within the College\nprecincts where students are\nallowed to park their cars.\nThe most important fact\nis that only those who have\nbeen allocated \" S,\"\"Sc,\" and \" D\" stickers are allowed to park in these zones\nduring the day, from Monday to Fridav.\nOnly residents with \" S\" stickers are allowed to park\nin the zone behind Linstead\n(and on the ramp) at any\ntime of the week. For this\nprivilege s they are i not Jo\npark in the zone in front of\nSouthside. This zone is reserved during College hours\nfor commuters with \" Sc \"\nstickers. However, in the\nevenings and at weekends\nthis is open to anyone. The\nsame rule applies to \" D\" zone, in the old Imperial\nInstitute Road.\nThe Union has the right\nto repeal stickers from students making incorrect u \u00a3e of Vim, and to evict^any\ncars not having the authority\nto park in these zones.\nOne further point is that\nResearch Assistants who are\nmembers of the Senior Common Room are not eligible\nfor Union parking spaces.\nYours faithfully,\nD.

It was bought back at an auction held at\nKings College almost a fortnight ago.\nOn that Friday night 75\nLeft Wing Challenge\nat NUS Conference\nNUS moderates had a tough day last Saturday zl\nthe Union conference in\nMargate, They just succeeded in beating off a strong left-win\" challenge\nto their authority.\nThe main debate was on\na proposed amendment to\nthe constitution, to allow\npolitical issues to be discussed at NUS conferences.\nAt present the conference is\nconfined to educational\nissues. The two-thirds majority necessary to alter the\nconstitution was narrowly\nmissed, the card vote being\n169,097 for, 87,541 against,\nwith 5,166 abstentions.\nAn alternative amendment allowing the union to\ndiscuss race issues, was proposed by Alun Evans, the\nvice-president. \" The Union\nmust take a stand against\nPowellism,\" Evans de-clare d. His motion was de-feat ed, but the conference\nlater adopted a motion calling for an \" open door\"\npolicy on immigration.\nIn a speech the day be-fore, Geoff Martin, the\nPresident, hit out at re-reaction and revolution in\nthe university world.\n*' There is a real possibility\nthat the frightening\n'Powellite' hysteria of the\nright, and the wild-eyed extremists of the left are bent\non a course leading to vio-len ce,\" he declared.\nHe outlined negotiations\nthe NUS have had with the\nVice-Chancellors and the\nAssociation of Education\nCommittees. He considered\nthat other educational\nunions were \" far behind us\nin influence, ideas and sucC 3 S S.\" Turning to the student\nmilitants, Martin continued : \" When the name\nof students is being kicked\ninto the gutter by professional agitators, many of\nwhom are non-students\nfrom parasite organisations,\nthen the NUS must face\nthe problem.\" Revolutionary socialism was \" a threat\nto freedom of speech and a challenge to democracy.\"\nFinally he appealed to\nthe NUS to put its conference in order. It was becoming a farce and fewer\ndelegates had attended\nMargate than usual.\npeon le from I.C. descended\non Kings College Union prepared to gain possession of\nMike by fair means or foul.\nThere seem to have been\ntwo factions of W.H.O. at\nKing's; one, led by Frank\nMorris, were busily sawing\nti rough the chains holding\nMike. Although they were\nsurrounded by Kings people\nthere was a bar party going\non and their actions went\nunnoticed. The 181 lb. lump\nof metal was to be auctioned\nat 10 o 'clock and John\nAuger, who claimed to be\nChairman of W. HvO .(much\nto W.H.O. s surprise) had arranged that the bidding\nshould stop at \u00a315 with I.C. holding the floor.\nNear Riots\nCouncil had refused to\nput up this money, but it\nwas raised from Constituent\nCollege funds. The auction\ntook place earlier than was\nplanned owing to the impatience of John Auger. This,\nunknown to him, foiled an\nattempt to steal Mike back.\nAlthough bidding went up\nto \u00a317, IC. was given the\nkey to the chains holding\nMike for \u00a315 cash after\nAuger had threatened to\n\" smash the place up.\" A red-painted Mike was\nhustled into a mini-van which\nwas driven off with rather\nmore noise than speed. The\nremainder of the mob'hut led insults at everything' and\nKings in particular until they\ngot fed up and returned\nhome, most of them without\nhaving caught a glimpse of\nMike.\nUnnoticed\nAfter a rather circuitous\nroute through London there\ncame the triumphal return.\nA few heads turned away\nfor a fleeting moment from\nthe goggle box, someone\neven clapped\u2014but on the\nwhole the arrival of Mike\nback in Southside was not\nquite the occasion that was\nanticipated by most of the\nglory seeking members of\nthe WHO. An attempt to\nbring Mike into GuildsMines carnival was foiled as\nfew of the bearers had\ntickets.\n1975?\nMike will not be returned\nto its plinth until all the\nalarm systems are working.\nAt the present rate of progress this should be at about\nthe end of 1975, but perhaps\nwhen W.H.O. has sorted\nout its own petty internal\nstrike it may deem to return Mike to its owners.\n\n"

In\neach department a member of staff with a special\ninterest in students' careers\nacts as the appointments\nrepresentative and thus students can be advised by\nmembers of staff who either\nhave, or can easily obtain,\ndirect knowledge of their\nstanding or capabilities and\nwho are in touch with the\ntrend of employment in the\nfields concerned. It is open\nto the prospective employer\nto deal direct with the departmental appointments\nrepresentatives or with the\nSecretary of the Board.\nWhen an employer wishes\nto see students from more\nthan one department arrangements are co-ordinated so that interviews may\nall be held in one depart-ment.\nProblems\nThis has been the system which has developed\nin the College but consideration has been given during\nthe last session to extending the service available to\nstudents. The strength of\nthe present arrangement\n\u2014the intimate knowledge\nof the trends in employment in the particular fields\nknown to the departmental\nappointments representative\n\u2014as also its weakness when\nmore general advice is required or information is\nsought about careers in\nfields not directly related to\nthe departmental disc ip lines.

It has been arranged therefore that, from\nthe beginning of next term,\nthe College will share in the\nUniversity Appointments\nBoard's \"Field Office Service.\"\nA few years ago following the appointment of its\nnew Secretary Mr. E. H.K. Dibden, the University Appointments Board explored\nthe possibility of interviewing students in their own\nColleges where a careers\nadvisory service was not already in existence; for want\nof a better term this development was labelled the\n\" Field ( Tices Service.' '\nThis development has\nproved so successful that\nthe Board now provides,\nthrough this means, a full\nscale careers advisory service in many of the major\nColleges of the University.\nCentralisation\nFrom the beginning of\nnext term, it is intended\nthat this service will be\navailable to supplement the\nexisting appointments arrangements in the College\nand on every Wednesday\nthroughout term, Mr. P.A. Ashworth, Deputy Secretary of the University Appointments Board will be\nattending the College to\ngive careers advice to students\nOther improvements in\nthe appointments arrangements should materialise\nwhen the various administrative sections of the College occupy, next summer,\nthe new building currently\nin the course of construction in the centre of the\nCollege site. Then, within\nthe Registry area, there will\nbe a centralised careers\nlibrary, with literature on\nopen access shelves, together with interviewing\nrooms, controlled and coordinated by Mr. Meacock.\nImprovements\nWhen this ac com mod tion is available, the Field Officer Service will oo e rate from there, but until then\nMr. Ashworth will occupy\na\" temporary home,\" the\nlocation of which will be\nannounced as soon as pos-sib le.

Snippings\nof tape recordings on which\nthe arresting voice of Lowin\nwas heard were played to\nthe snoring crowds.\nUn ion\nPropaganda\nWhat Corr lacked in concrete evidence Jane Pearson,\ncounsel for the defer.c?= made up for with her occasional attempts at serious\npropaganda for the Union\nand general lack of wit.\nParker's Newtonian satellite\nalias \" Sam Seed \" alias an\nactual grass root of the\nUnion was called as a witness and assistant Union\nPropagandist.\nLowin, as final witness,\nlaunched into a characteristic gentle tirade of a speech\nlasting several minutes and\ndefinitely not answering any\nspecific questions asked by\ncounsellor Jane.\nHanging\nAfter sentence Lowin was\nhung in Prince's Gardens\nalong with Corr and Parker,\nalas the noose being mistakenly changed for a special harness.\nLost\nOpportunity\nOne can only feel that the\nTrial was an opportunity\nlost for the Debating Society. The speeches were\ngenerally bad and, it would\nappear, mainly off-the-cuff.\nConcentrating on trivialities\nthe speakers ignored all the\npublicised charges and came\nup time and again with irrelevant facts which were not\neven amusing.\nPerhaps next year they\ncan try again.\nthe Conservatives would\ngain from votes at 18. This\nappears to run against the\ngeneral feeling in the national press that most 18-21\nyear olds would vote\nLabour.\nTn answer to questions\nrelating to student affairs.\nSir Edward said that the increase in grants was calculated by dividing the recommended increase by\ntwo. He appreciated the\nstudents' demands for more\ndemocratic running of the\nuniversities, and supported\nmilitant protests on occasions, as long as they did\nnot turn to violence. \u00bb\nL9\nScene: Lecture Theatre.\nSomeone falling off their seat\nsound asleep.
