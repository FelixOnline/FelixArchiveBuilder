    "content": "decided to suspend meetings until such time as we had\na statement which we could give, as the alternative\nwould have been to hold meetings and to deliberately\nmislead the committee. The committee met again after\nan effective gap of two months, not an excessive delay\ncompared to previous years.\nThere was an implied allegation of an irregularity\nconcerning the snack bar about which I know nothing\nand of an IOU taken out by a member of catering staff\nabout which I know something. The money covered by\nthe IOU was apparently taken out before I took office\nbut I was asked to call it in which I did. The borrower\ndoes not know to this day where the money actually\ncame from or to where it is supposed to be repaid. No\none has furnished me with this information and it does\nnot seem to show up on the trading account. The\nmoney is still locked up in my office as I am still unsure\nof its status and I would not approve of its joining the\nun accounted for sums which exist in the Union safe\nand are occasionally used for buying such items as\nbottles of sherry.\nI am charged with a failure to communicate with the\nlicence es and whilst this is not an easy charge to either\nprove of refute, it is to my mind one of the more\nsignificant ones. Whilst I would freely admit that there\nare a number of personal differences between myself\nand the licence es, the important factor is that\nprofessional channels should be kept open and in this\nregard I feel that I have fulfilled my obligations. Both\nwere informed immediately of the apparent shortfalls in\nthe bar and the catering accounts and were involved in\nthe decision making process of what to do about them\nfrom the start. There are a number of people who bear\nresponsibilities for the bar and catering activities and to\nmake the charge that I was making decisions and\nexcluding people who had a need to know is to claim\nthat those people could not possibly have any\nresponsibility for the problems which we have\nencountered as they did not know about them. As soon\nas I became aware of the problems I passed the\ninformation on. None of us were aware of the stock\nsituation before the finance officer began work and I was not and could not have been aware that a possible\ntheft had taken place in either the bar or the snack bar\nbefore this time.\nHaving stated that I could not have prevented\nsomething which I could not have known was taking\nplace I must state that I believe that at all times since\nbecoming aware of the situation I have acted in a proper manner. Since the involvement of the police, my\nrole has become less significant given that their first\ncontact has always been the President. As the\ninvestigation has progressed, there has been\ninformation which has not been passed on to me and\nthis has affected the amount which I have been able to\ndo.\nThe responsibilities are not, as I have already stated,\nvested in me alone. If management was to blame then\nit is the management structure which must shoulder\nthe responsibility and not one person. We have known\nfor a long time that the Union needs to change to ful ful its management responsibilities and I have always been\nsupportive of such moves, particularly from the point of\nview of bringing in a finance officer as I have already\nmentioned. I alone cannot be blamed for the way in\nwhich the matter has been handled given that in the\ninitial stages I was only one part of a group of people\nmaking decisions and in the later stages I was not even\nkept informed of what was happening. If the licence es or the President feel that more should have been done\nin any direction then they themselves had an obligation\nto do something or, if they felt that I should have been\ndoing something, asking me to do it. At the start of the\nyear I asked the President to deal through me if he\nwanted something done about the bar or the snack bar.\nThis was simply because I felt that he had a tendency\nto overreact at the slightest provocation and that this\nwould not be good for staff relations. It was not, and\ncould not have been, any kind of disclaimer of\nresponsibility on his psr t in either area.\nIf the finger of suspicion is to point at all at those\npeople who have handled stock then it must surely\npoint at those who handled invoices or cash. There\nmay be no evidence to suggest malpractice on the part\nof, say, the Union Administrator, but she was never\ninterrogated by the police and in any case there is little\nor no evidence against the bar and catering staff who\nhave been sacked or suspended. The Union must be\nfair and must be seen to be fair, there are not two\nclasses of employee as no one is above suspicion and\nno one is beneath justice.\nI have remained in office but am presently\nconsidering taking up a job offer for the near future\ngiven that I feel very bitter about the way in which I have been treated in the name of a students' union into\nwhich I have put an enormous amount of time, effort\nand (dare I say it?) love over the past three years. I resent being asked to carry the official can for\nsomething which I can accept no blame but for which I would have been prepared to bear whatever part of the\nresponsibility was ex-officio mine for a system which\nhas clearly been shown to be at fault.\nI am prepared to submit my annual report but only if\nthe ICUGM asks for it; it is up to that body to decide\nwhether it is happy to accept the easy solution of\nfinding scapegoats and allowing those who would shirk\ntheir responsibilities to appear blameless.\nI have done nothing dishonest and reject the charge\nof 'gross mismanagement', I feel I have a right to have\nAlan Rose, ICU Deputy President.\n\n"

Due to the overwhelming\nindifference shown to my first article\nI had to plead, wheedle and buy\ndrinks for the FELIX hierarchy\n(where was mine?\u2014Ed) to be allowed\nto write another and to stop being\nreplaced by an article on the spawning\nhabits of the Mongolian tree frog.\nRight, now for the music. Now is\na great time to go to hear classical\nmusic in London. The great part of\nthe world's top fiddle players have,\nor are about to, descend on the capital\nin conjunction with the LSO International Violin Series.\nIn the week ahead you will be able\nto hear Beethoven, Creig, Elgar,\nTchaikovski, Rackmaninov and\nDebussy.\nTonight at 7.45pm at the Barbican\nthe LSO have a rich bill\u2014the star\nattraction of which must be the\nTchaikovski Violin Concerto in D Major.\nThis is a major work with a wonderful, intensely sad subject in its\nfirst movement and all kinds of\nbreathtaking scales. The second\nmovement is full of retrospection and\nwist fullness. It is typical\nTchaikovski\u2014even its happiest\nmoments are introspective and\nregretful of what might have been.\nThe third movement flies along and\nrequires nimble and quick\nfinger work. Sunday May 15 sees another great\nTchaikovski/Mussorzky/Rackmaninov programme at the Barbican. The\nLSO play Night on the Blue\nMountain. The all famous\nRackmaninov Piano Concerto No 2\nand the real star Tchaikovski's Symphony No 6 in B minor.\nIt is impossible to preview all the\nconcerts but I have highlighted the\nbest. The star concert this week is the\nLSO performance of Beethoven's Triple Concerto in C major featuring\nthe brother/sister/sister trio of Myung\nWhun Chung, Kyung Sha Chung and\nMyung Wha Chung. The piece was\nan unprecedented achievement in\norchestration, allowing all\ninstruments to be heard irrespective\nof their very different tones. The\norchestra is almost redundant in some\nplaces as the three solo instruments\nplay as a trio in their own right and\nin places trying to outdo each other\nin the first movement. The second and\nthird movement blend wonderfully\ninto one another with 'cello starting\nand finishing the second.\nAlso appearing on the same bill is\nMahler Symphony No 1 'Titan'\nwhich in my opinion is brilliant.\nMatthew Salter.\n10 Friday 13th May 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nI was listening to a report on the radio\nyesterday which detailed the results\nof an extensive survey into the values\nof 18-28 year olds. I think that most\nof us fit into that category. It\nconcluded that Mrs Thatcher's 'Victorian' values are back and that\nwe were all being far too sensible\nabout life.\nThe average 18-28 year old\npractises safe sex and believes in\nmono go mou s relationships: his views\nare slightly right of centre and he\nsounds as boring as hell. 'Today's young has turned its back on the\nSixties', proclaimed the reporter.\n'Today's young plays it safe'. I had\nto agree with him and I had to identify\nwith Mr Average 18-28 year old. But\naren't we all missing something.\nI always believed that growing up,\nmaturing, call it what you will, was\nsomething that you did by your own\nexperience. We all have to burn our\nfingers before we learn not to touch\nthe fire. Our generation, however,\nhas grown up to be the unquestioning\ngeneration. We believe what we are\nfed by the Government, media and\neven our parents, then we make our\nown conclusions from the information\nwe have been given. All we want out\nof life is enough money for luxuries,\nour own homes and somebody to\nlove. We may occasionally collect a little money for Rag, go to a charity\nconcert, give to the RSPCA, but we\ndon't seem to care for others or give\nthem our precious time.\nI don't remember much about the\nSixties but I certainly prefer their\nvalues to those of the Eighties. I feel\nI 've missed something while\npractising safe sex and planning for\nmy future. Do you?\nPuppet on a string\nI feel really sorry for Sydney\nHarbour-Bridge. He tries so hard to\nmake everybody like him. A few do\nuntil they find out how easily led the\npoor dear is. All this year he has\nallowed himself to be manipulated by\na few key people who make all his\ndecisions for him, give him his ideas\nand tell him what a naughty boy he\nis if he talks to FELIX.\nLast week I received a telephone\ncall from one of the Union Bar\nLicensees. He said that he would\nappreciate it if nothing was published\nconcerning the Snack Bar or Union\nBar losses and that he was asking on\nbehalf of Mr Harbour-Bridge. But\nSyd gave me an hour and a half\ninterview that night where we\ncarefully went over exactly what I could publish. I checked every fact he\ngave me twice. I also spoke to Alan\nRose. I then published the story in the\nFELIX flysheet.\nNext day Syd was severely\nreprimanded by individuals who have\nno place to give advice, or to say that\nthey speak in the best interest of the\nUnion. He has decided not to tell any\nmember of FELIX staff any more\ndetails concerning this; unpleasant\nsituation.\nHowever, last Friday he^Mye a very detailed interview tp Broadsheet\nEditor Dave Smedley on wh if cj wave based his lead story this week. The\nstory, purporting to bethe actual truth\nwas entirely the 'truth'; according to\nHarbour-Bridge. I have spoken to\nmost concerned and they all say that\nthey were never approached by Mr\nSmedley for an interview'. How can\nRCSU allow their newspaper to be\nused in such a blatant pro pog and a campaign? And why was Broadsheet\ncovering an Imperial College Union\nnews story anyway?\nDave accused me in his editorial of\n'effectively create(ing) news at the\nexpense of people'. Strong words but\nare they really justified? I asked the\npeople who I'm accused of using.\nNone of us could see any news that\nI had 'created' at their expense. So\nwhat's Dave getting at? I shall in turn\naccuse Dave of distorting viewpoints,\nprinting one-sided news stories and\nbeing used to further the aims of the\npuppet and his puppet masters.\nAnnual Reports\nI was very disappointed that neither\nthe President nor the Deputy\nPresident presented annual reports\nthis week. I hope that the Annual\nGeneral Meeting next Thursday will\ninsist that both reports are circulated\nin FELIX at a date in the near future\nso that we can all see exactly what\nboth sabbaticals have done for us this\nyear.\nTurn Up!\nPlease come to the Annual General\nMeeting of the Union next week and\nquestion your Union officers about the\npast year.\nRandoms\nDid you know that Cameron Small\ngot aU in Physics?

    "content": "due in part I am sure to the competence of Jackie Pierce, last year's DP,\nand so most reasonable el aims to UFC have been accepted. However it\nbecame clear at the time of the Estimates UFC for next year's budgets\nthat UFC is badly in need of some coherent policies. Bits and pieces of\npolicy on funding, spending etc are scattered through old UFC minutes,\nand I hope that next year's DP spends some time collecting these\ntogether into some form of policy document. This would make\neverybody's job at estimate time much simpler.\nSCC currently has about 2500 members, which means that the subsidy\nthey get from the Union is about \u00a33.50 a head. This represents, I feel,\nexceptional value for money when you consider the degree of activity of .\nthe SCC clubs. One financial bugbear that I am very pleased has not\nrain sed its ugly head this year (touch wood) is the issue of Ultra Vires\npayments. It may be that SCC committees have finally worked out what\nan Ultra Vires payment is (aside from being illegal) and have decided to\nbe good boys. For that I am glad.\nOne final bit of Union business that has been of r eleven ce to SCC was\nthe 'reorganisation' of the room booking system. After it was discovered\nwhat a mess this was it took a massed deputation of MSC chairmen to\nchange it back to what it always was. I trust the old system is now\nworking as well as it always used to, if not better.\n4. Final Bits It certainly has been an interesting year, and SCC chairman an interesting\njob. Its a pleasure to regularly meet and assist such a varied and\nenthusiastic group of people as members of the SCC club committees,\nand they all deserve thanks for their work in their own clubs and\nsocieties. I see the job of S CC chairman merely as one of making things\nas easy as possible for the clubs to get on with doing their business of\nrunning events of interest to their members and students in general.\nSeeing so many clubs doing so well is what makes the job worthwhile.\nOne final notice to all SCC clubs. Please get forms for the Union directory\nfrom your pigeon holes in the Union Office, and send your articles for the\nICU Handbook to Dave Smedley in the Felix Office as soon as possible.\nIt just remains for me to wish next year's SCC chairman, whoever it may\nbe, the best of luck, and I you get as much out of the job as I have.\n'It was a tough job but somebody had to do it.'\n\u2014 Superchicken\nDave Clements, SCC Chairman 1987-88\nSocial Cultural & Amusements Board Chair\nRichard Squire\nA report on the activities of the Social, Cultural and Amusements Board\nduring the 1987/88 session.\n1. Societies Despite the loss of the Music Room, Chamber Music have had a good\nyear, with the formation of a new chamber orchestra along with ICSO.\nThey have also organised four concerts, and several coaching sessions\nfor members.\nChoir have had two successful concerts so far, performing extracts\nfrom 'Seasons' and 'Christmas Oratorio' in the first term, and Verdi's 'Requiem' to a packed Great Hall in March. They also organise many\nsocial events for members, such as rehearsal weekends out of town.\nDeb soc have this year held a major debate on the NUS, and a Collegewide debating competition. Two Debsoc members also won this year's ULU debating competition. Debsoc are likely to transfer to SCC next\nsession.\nDram soc had successful runs of Satre's 'The Flies' and Durrenmatt's 'The Physicists' in the Union Concert Hall, despite one or two difficulties.\nThis summer they are off to the Edinburgh Festival for the Nth successive\nyear. Dramsoc's range of technical services for events is also continuing\nto expand.\nIn their second year, Films oc have successfully increased their number\nof film showings, showing a wide variety of films to a wide variety of\naudiences in Mech Eng 220, on Tuesday and Thursdays. The 'Cult Movie'\nseason was a feature of this year's programme.\nFolk Club has been given new life this year after a long period of\ndormancy, specialising in the performance and appreciation of Folk Music.\nEvents have been held in both the Holland Club and Norman's, and\nmembers played at several events during Rag Week.\nJazz and Rock continues in its expansion, with bands from the club\nplaying gigs both inside and outside College. More new bands have been\nformed this year than in previous years, and two Hops have been held,\nwith improved organisation and increased attendance.\nOrchestra's year has seen performances of Hoist's 'The Planets' and\nTchaikovsky's 'The Nutcracker Suite' among many others. The Orchestra\nhas been more balanced this year, due to an influx of talented new\nplayers into the strings section. The concerts have also been well\nattended, with every seat in the Great Hall filled for the Autumn\nperformance of 'The Planets'.\nLast, but not least, Operatic Society have had a difficult year with a small committee, but due to a lot of hard work by a few people, have\nmanaged to make their shows a success. Their February show this year\nwas 'The Gondoliers' by Gilbert and Sullivan. A strong intake of keen\nfresher s this year should serve to make life easier for them.\n2. The Music Room Over the summer of 1987, the old Humanities buildings of 52-53 Princes\nGate were taken over by the new School of Management. With them\nwent the Music Room, for years the centre of College's musical activity,\nand several other smaller practice rooms. The School of Management\nintended to use these facilities for conference and educational purposes\non a permanent basis, to the exclusion of Music.\nA campaign by the musical community within College ensued, in the\nhope of keeping the space provided for music in College to at least its\nprevious (albeit inadequate) level. A lot of work was done, both by\nmembers of College's Music Committee, and by members of the student\nmusical societies; publicity was produced, a petition raised, and a concert\nheld in Sherfield foyer in protest. The result of all this was not the\nretention of the Music Room for music, but its temporary replacement by\nTerminal Room A, in the old Holland Club building, along with a new\nSteinway concert grand piano for which the money (20K) was arranged\nby College. Replacements for the smaller practice rooms had been found\npreviously, in various parts of the Sherfield Building. However, the current\narrangements are far from satisfactory. Terminal Room A being generally\nacknowledged to be an inadequate, and only a temporary replacement for\nthe Music Room. It must be ensured therefore, by myself, my successor\nand the members of the Music Committee, that the Rector's undertaking\nto look for sponsorship money to fund an extension to the Huxley\nBuilding, for the sole purpose of music, is carried through.\nThanks are due to the chairpersons of the musical societies, along with\nIan Howgate and Al Birch for their work over this issue.\n3. SCAB Nite A few years ago, SCAB Nite used to make a perennial loss. This year, for\nthe second year running, almost \u00a3200 was raised for Rag. Members of all\nthe SCAB societies took part, and my thanks must go to everyone\ninvolved, especially those who helped behind the scenes setting up. You\nknow who you are.\n4. Capital Equipment Again this year, losses to SCAB capital equipment have occurred due to\ntheft owing to lack of security in the Union Building. With luck, the new\nlock system recently purchased by House Committee should improve\nthings, so long as the system is not abused.\n5. Finance A review of UFC financial policy is badly needed, and is currently being\ncarried out. SCAB'S financial policy is currently under discussion, and\nmay need to be tailored to fit in logically with newly formulated UFC\npolicy, governing the presentation of estimates etc.\nThe College's long delay in returning last year's accounts has been of\nno help at all this year.\nIn summary, a mixed year for SCAB. The loss of the Music Room was a bad blow, but all of the societies have had an active year, and one new\nsociety has been started up again.\nMy thanks for help during the year go to Ian, Alan and Chas, Chris\nMartin (for fixing our finances!), the chairpersons of al! the SCAB\nsocieties, and to Bill Wakeman, Nigel, and, of course, Dinah...\nRichard Squire,\nSocial, Cultural and Amusements\nBoard Chairman 1987/88.\n8 Annual Report '88 FELIX\n\n"

See Judith if it's yours.\nUseless phones\nDear FELLY,\nHaving been back at College for two weeks and only\nhaving received two external telephone calls, I must write\nto express my concern over the efficiency of the new\nWeeks/Garden Hall exchange. As I understand from your\nexplanation at the beginning of term, there is only one\nline between the exchange and the main College exchange.\nThis means that only one person in the whole of\nWeeks/Garden Hall can receive an external call at one\ntime. Is this really so? It seems too preposterous to be\ntrue. Before this new, and, I presume, highly expensive,\nexchange scheme, each landing had a simple, four-digit\nextension number, and no problems arose. Now, not only\nis the new phone engaged to all external callers (even if\nit is not actually in use), but its ringing tone is virtually\ninaudible and it needs a sharp tap before it actually\nconnects! What use is a telephone exchange with all sorts\nof high-fal ut in' and fairly useless applications if it cannot\nguarantee simple communication? Why should the external\ncaller (probably long-distance or in a call box) suffer the\nexpense of waiting while the line is supposedly engaged?\nThe most annoying aspect is that the previous phone\nsystem worked efficiently. Perhaps the new Weeks/Garden\nHall exchange should have an external number totally\nseparate from that of the main College exchange. But\nabove all\u2014why the deplorable waste of money on an\nineffective scheme? College\u2014and students\u2014are hard up\nenough as it is without resources being squandered in this\nway.\nYours,\nMadelaine Stafford.\nA A dismay\nDear Judith,\nI was dismayed to read last week's report entitled 'Union\nsquashes debate' (FELIX 801). This report was both\nbiased and incorrect.\nFirst let me clarify that the Anti-Apartheid Society has\na 'no platform' policy against persons who officially\nrepresent the system of Apartheid. It is not against debates\nor public meetings in which Apartheid-related issues are\ndiscussed.\nIn the case of the debate, planned by the Debating\nSociety for May 5, we objected to the invitation of Mr\nJan Castalyn of the South African Embassy. We refused\nto oppose the motion in that particular planned debate\nbecause we did not want to legit i mise Apartheid by\nstanding on the same platform as Mr Castalyn. That is\nwhy it comes as no surprise to me that both Sydney\nHarbour-Bridge and Abby Amushila (who had, at first,\nagreed to speak) and the Zambian, Zimbabwean and other\nAfrican Embassies refused to participate.\nThe article which appeared in FELIX on the cancelled\ndebate, states that members of Anti-Apartheid asked\npeople not to enter Mech Eng 220 'where the debate was\nbeing held'\u2014we could not have possibly done this because\nthere was no debate being held in Mech Eng 220.\nIt also says that the President of DebSoc spent forty\nminutes asking Anti-Apartheid members 'to go into the\ndebate'. Again, this statement is not correct as the\nPresident, Ms Lynda Matthews, could not have asked us\nto join a non-existent debate.\nWhat Ms Matthews did want, was for me to speak, in\nMech Eng 220, to all the Anti-Apartheid demonstrators\npresent, explaining why I believe in a 'no platform' policy;\nwhich, of course, is ridiculous, since none of the\ndemonstrators would have been demonstrating if they did\nnot agree with such a policy.\nThe article also states that we were 'totally against\nparticipating' in debates. This is wholly and grossly untrue.\nI told Ms Matthews that I was personally willing to speak\nin a debate, especially one whose motion was\nApartheid-related.\nWhat this article did not mention was that there were\naround fifty people, demonstrating their disapproval\nagainst the invitation of a member of the South African\nEmbassy, outside Mech Eng 220 and only about five\npeople, mostly members of DebSoc, inside the lecture\ntheatre (presumably having a general discussion).\nYet none of the demonstrators were interviewed or\napproached by FELIX staff, and none of us were either\nnamed or quoted in the article. On the other hand,\nstatements made by members of DebSoc were published\nin FELIX.\nFinally, I think that some people may feel that the bias\nin the article was not unexpected, seeing that it was written\nby Mr Andrew Allum (and sub-edited by yourself). Mr\nAllum is not only a member of the the Debating Society,\nbut was ak j meant to be a speaker in the cancelled debate.\nI hope that the article which appeared last week was\nonly an isolated case and that reports in FELIX, in future,\nwill return to their normal high standard of truthfulness\nand journalistic competence.\nYours sincerely,\nRakesh Muthoo, Chairman, Anti-Apartheid Society.\nMr Muthoo's letter contains a factual inaccuracy: the\nFELIX reporter who wrote the story was Mr Andrew\nWaller who bears absolutely no resemblance to Mr\nAlliiii at all. I apologise if our story appeared biased.\nIt was not intended to.\nDear Judith,\nSanctions or no Sanctions?\nWhat is the role of the IC Debating Society? What is\ndebating all about? What is real freedom of speech?\n'It is essential to the purposes of the College that\nopportunities for free and open discussions shall be\nsafeguarded' (IC freedom of speech: code of practice).\nThis is what we, as IC Debating Society are trying to\ndefend with all the means available to us. We have the\nduty to promote discussion of subjects which we think\nwould be of interest to IC students. As is inevitable, most\nissues have two rivaling arguments and our role is to make\nsure the participating audience is able to listen to both sides\nof the argument. Ideally, no one should obstruct such\ndemocracy, and, surely, anyone opposed to this is termed\nno less than a dictator.\nSpeaking in public is a state of art on its own. Amongst\nthe finest speakers in history one could mention Winston\nChurchill, Mark Anthony, Martin Luther King, Steven\nBico, etc. These people have persuaded a multitude of\npeople of their convictions by means of the spoken word\nand by nothing else.\nWhy should a group of people at Imperial College deny\nthe majority of students at IC of a grand occasion of\ntestifying such an event? Such is the fallacy of what\nhappened on Thursday May 5 in the vicinity of Mech Eng\n220: a historic event in itself, as I realised what a determined few hard-liners bring about. Of course, with\nno respect for lawlessness, I continue in my endeavours\nto ensure the true freedom of speech where absolutely no\none would be inhibited as they speak forth their own\nindividual mind.\nYours democratically and individually,\nMark Gialanze (Physics 1).\nFELIX Friday 13th May 1988 11\n\n"

Sandra Dawson and\nI met the new first years who wanted to meet us. A significant\nproportion of those who turned up had been on the ICWISE course,\nanother of which has been organised mostly by Margaret Cunningham\n(and the Rector's working party for the recruitment of women students)\nfor this Summer.\nCouncil was very boring. Welfare Committee started off well, with the\nalcohol awareness campaign taking shape. However, the campaign was\nshelved until next year (or maybe never) and the committee hasn't met\nsince. Julie Hall, ULU Women's Officer, contacted me last term and there\nwas a meeting of women's reps (I sent Helen Fitzpatrick) where\nimportant issues were discussed. However, when I went to the next\nmeeting, there was no one there and no one had heard of Julie Hall, i It's been a year of firsts for me including: the ICU Ladies Lunch which\nwill hopefully become an annual event, and this report (the first from a Women's Officer). I can't tell you about the video on cervical cancer\nbecause it hadn't happened at the time of writing.\nGood luck to Gill Knowles for next year and hopefully WIST will rise\nfrom the grave as well.\nLinzi Wishart, Women's Officer\nthe basis of University of London teams and in some cases such as\nVolleyball providing over half the UL team.\nThis year, as a committee, we have encouraged coaching in all sports\nand I hope that over the next few years, more clubs may benefit from\nwhat is an important part of training. If more teams are to learn to play\nbetter and more people are to be brought into sport it is vital that\ncoaching facilities are improved. I hope through our Union funding that it\nwill be possible to continue this in the future.\nOff the field advances have been made in a few areas although there is\nstill a great deal to be done over the next few years in particular\nregarding the provision of indoor sports facilities. Agreement has now\nbeen reached as to the type of facilities which should be provided for an\nindoor sports facility on campus and this has now been accepted by the\ngovernors. The development is now at the 'project definition stage' and a number of architects are being asked to submit proposals.\nThe development of the basement of Southside for the provision of a weights gym/health club has also been given provisional approval and at\npresent is being discussed with reference to the type of facilities which\nshould be provided. This is one area in which I anticipate the ACC Chairman and new Union Manager will be very involved over the next\nfew months.\nOutdoors, the extraction of gravel from Harlington is proceeding and at\npresent over half a million pounds has been raised from this source. It is\nhoped that it will not be very long before an astroturf pitch will be put\ndown at Harlington and at present projections are being made prior to a definite decision as to the date and place where it will be.\nAnother significant development next year will be the possibility of St\nMary's students competing under Imperial colours. In all cases. I think to\nobtain maximum benefit to both sets of students, clubs should\nindividually contact their opposite numbers at St Mary's and work out\nhow they may best cooperate. Already, the Waterpolo teams have agreed\nto merge and I would imagine in many sports this would be to the long\nterm advantage of sport at Imperial.\nFinally, I would just like to thank all this year's members of the Mafia\nand those Capo-regimes who have regularly turned up to meetings. May I remind all Capo-regimes that elections for next year's Mafia are on May\n24 and it is in your own interest to stand!\nGood luck to 'Rob' 1988/89 whoever he/she may be.\nRob Gee, ACC Chair.\n.'*th let ics Clubs Committee Chair\nRobert Gee\nAffiliation to the Universities Athletic Union (UAU) has continued to\nenhance the general level of sport throughout the College with several\ngood performances over the full range of sports.\nTeams from Football, Rugby, Badminton, Fencing, Hockey and Squash\nreached the last sixteen in the play offs of the UAU.

The Karate Club have also been very successful this year,\nconsistently winning medals in all University competitions often only\nfinishing second to Cambridge University.\nAgain however, the Boat Club were Imperial's only winners when they\nwon both the first and second eights UAU Championships. This followed\nan impressive summer last year when they won the Visitor's Challenge\nCup at Henley beating UL in the final and had thirteen members of the\nClub selected to row for Great Britain, some in the World Student Games,\nUnder 23 Championships and World Championships.\nOnce again this year it can be seen that many IC teams are providing\nOverseas Students Committee Chair\nQavid Munasinghe\nThe OSC has traditionally been one of the quietest of the MSCs and\nsomewhat remote from the rest of ICU. This year I have tried to bring the\nOSC more into the mainstream of ICU activity, and I hope this policy will\nbe continued in the future.\nREPRESENTATION:\nThe OSC not only represents the various National Societies at IC but\nevery overseas student at Imperial. It is this which leads me to voice my\nconcern at the way College administration treats the overseas student as\na direct commodity. College has realised that full fee paying students\nprovide a valuable source of income and has initiated a series of intensive\nrecruitment programmes worldwide. This has seen the number of\noverseas students at IC increase to about 11 50 this year, and this figure\nwill be exceeded by at least 100 next year.\nMy concern is based on the fact that College does not deem it necessary\nto provide the additional support services in terms of welfare and\naccommodation which will be needed due to the increased numbers.\nIt may prove possible to increase the numbers of overseas students in the\nshort term if the above policies are continued but if the students returning\nFELIX Annual Report '88 5\n\n"

However I must thank Admissions Tutors and\nregistry staff for doing their best in the circumstances.\nMeeting with Schools: This conference, held in the Easter vacation, was\nwell received by the 40 or so senior and Head teachers who attended.\nCollege spared no expense to see that they were fed with all the best\nstatistics (from Peter Mee) and nosh (from Rob Northey)! The most useful\npart was talking to the visitors: I gave them an unbiased view to take\nback to their pupils; IC is a good College - but also faces some serious\nproblems (which many school Heads seemed unaware of.)\n4. Careers Advisors Committee: This committee met once, just before the\nstart of the Academic year. In spite of the good intentions of the\ndepartmental careers advisors and those in Sherfield this particular area is\nseriously understaffed, as I myself have found. I hope the committee\nrealises that finalists need all the help they can get in finding work.\nPerhaps departments should send a questionnaire to all tina'is ts to find\nout exactly what they want to do - this wil i give them some sort of idea\nof the numbers they will be dealing with (i.e. those who want jobs and\nthose who want to do further study). This is one area which I think needs\ndefinite improvement.\n5. Rector's Working Party on the Recruitment of Women Students: Under\nMargaret Cunningham's aegis this working party has discussed some of\nthe problems IC faces in recruiting more women. The IC-WISE courses,\nstarted last year, have paid off and will be run again this year, both as\nresidential and non-residential courses. The number of women students at\nIC has increased to nearly 1000, but shows a slight fall in percentage\nterms.\nIn general, I have enjoyed sitting on College committees in spite of the\npreparation that is needed for each one. I have to be alert 100% of the\ntime; since on many occasions I am the only rep for all 5,250 of you. It's quite a responsibility - administrators and academics see student reps\ncome and go but it's your future which is often at stake.\nB.UNION COMMIT T TEES1. Academic Affairs Committee: This has been the backbone of the\nUnion's work in Academic Affairs. I have tried to make the meetings\ninteresting and have provided refreshments for members at most\nmeetings. Chairing the committee has not always been easy, though. We\nhave had 8 meetings so far this academic year and there will be two\nmore this term. AAC Secretary: Jo Feakes has not been able to attend\nmany meetings this year owing to academic pressures; as a result I have\nnot given her the support that she deserves for doing what is a thankless\ntask. Ordinary members: Gail Turner and Linzi Wishart were ratified at the\nResults UGM last term but both have yet to attend any meetings.\nSabbatical members: I am very disappointed with these members of the\ncommittee. Sydney Harbour-Bridge is the only sabbatical officer who has\nshown any interest in the committees work. Alan Rose and Chas\nJackson's attitudes towards the committee have left much to be desired.\nEven Kingston and Q were better! Information: the three Union\nsabbaticals are ex-officio members of all Union Committees. Dep Reps\nand CCU AAOs: By far the most active and involved members this year.\nIn the past Dep Reps have been crit i sized for not being involved enough\nwith the Union. However with the Lecturer Questionnaire I have been\nable to ensure that almost all of them do their jobs properly. For many\nstudents their Dep Rep is the only Union Officer they have any real\ncontact with; and I am pleased to report that most of them have\naccepted this responsibility.\nThis year's best Dep Reps have been in Guilds - thanks to the efforts of\nBecky Hunt, Guilds AAO. She has taken a keen interest in problems faced\nby all Guilds students, not only those in her department. Dave Bradley\nhas done an excellent job as Mines A AO; he is a useful representative on\nCollege Committees and I shall be sorry to see him go this June when he\ngraduates. Executive Sub-committee: I set up this committee (consisting\nof myself and the three CCU AAOs) so that we could review papers for\nCollege Committees with the idea of co-ordinating representation thereon.\nWe have also been able to deal with matters at CCU level rather than\ndepartmental level, to discuss topics which are then taken to the full\ncommittee for approval. As a forum for discussion, Mason and social ising it has been successful. St. Mary's Academic Affairs: As a result of a motion passed at the committee last term, William Liddell, St. Mary's Education Rep, now attends meetings. Next year there will be 4 reps, the\nEducation Rep (equivalent to a CCU AAO) and 3 year reps (equivalent to\nDep Reps), being pre clinical1&2, and clinical.\nI have been down to St. Mary's several times to lias e with their Union\nOfficers in the bar; these events have been extensively documented\nelsewhere.\n2. Council : This huge committee is at best controversial and lively, at\nworst dull and tedious. I have provided written reports to every Council\nmeeting this year - unlike \"certain Union Officers I could mention\".\n3. Other Union Committees: I have sat on many of the other Union\nCommittees, too numerous to mention here. I am somewhat disheartened\nwhen I see almost the same people each time sitting on them.\nC. GENERAL1. Ac Reps: Much to my regret, I have not been able to get to know as\nmany Ac Reps as I would have liked. I tried to organise some\ninterdepartmental training evening last December but this idea was not\nwell received by Dep Reps. As a result it is hardly surprising if many Ac\nReps have never seen or spoken to me this year. This is not the way I intended the Academic structure within the Union to run; how are Ac\nReps supposed to get involved with the Union at a higher level if they are\nnot in contact with at least their CCU AAO?\n2. Academic Affairs 1/2 day: this event, now in its third year, was run\nlast term and although the attendance was somewhat disappointing, all\nthose present agreed that it had been useful. The meeting was addressed\nby the Rector, who also answered questions from the floor. Looking back\non this year, that's probably the only time the Rector has had to answer\nto ordinary students!\n3. Rest of this term: There will be two more meetings of the full\nAcademic Affairs Committee (including the Joint meeting) as well as four\nof the Executive sub-committee. By the time you read this the\nUndergraduate Studies Committee will have considered its review of the\nMaths Department. Service teaching by the department has often come\nunder criticism. Apart from that there are only a couple of college\nCommittees; most people will be sitting exams.\n4. Next Year: Dep Reps for the departments of Chemistry, Aeronautics\nand Mineral Resources Engineering still have to be elected. As Deputy\nPresident I will have overall responsibility for Academic Affairs within the\nUnion; the College Questionnaire will be run again, with the results being\npublished for the first time. The Academic Affairs Committee itself will be\nstronger, since many of this year's members will be on the committee\nnext year.\nConclusions:\nAt the end of this academic year I will have been at IC for four years; but\nthis year has undoubtedly been the most enjoyable. I have learned a great\ndeal about the way College works; this experience will be useful for me\nnext year. However many of the things I have achieved would have been\nimpossible without the support of other Union representatives, and some\nCollege personnel, some of whom are mentioned in this report. To them I extend my grateful thanks.\nI can only hope that Richard Spencer, this year's Mech Eng Dep Rep and\nmy successor, will be able to look back on next year with the same pride\nI have this year. To him, and a; i of you, I wish the best of luck for the\nfuture.\nCharles Brereton,\nIC Union Academic Affairs Officer 1987-88\nEntertainments Officer\nJohn Noble\nNo report submitted.\nExternal Affairs Officer\nNeil Motteram\nI 've realised a few things in my\npast three terms as EAO:\n1) That the outside world is not really a nice place.\n2) That the government doesn't really give a damn about students.\n3) That the University doesn't care too much about student opinions.\n4) That it helps if the EAO does something all year.\nGERBil l This was a major campaign. We don't have many of those. The support\nwe got from the students after we actually explained to them what was\ngoing on was wonderful. It does prove that IC students do care if the\nissues are explained to them.\nThe strike was not very well followed up. After we got positive\nresponses from some of the MPs that we talked to, we should have\nwritten to them and followed up their interest. This did not happen.\nThe GERBill was considerably amended in its Commons Report Stage.\nThis was due to immense pressure from Labour, the teaching and\nUniversity unions, the TUC, the NUS, and perhaps, us.

Have\nyou ever had that urge, drawing you\nto the open skies and wondered what\nit's like being up there? Unfortunately\nnormal powered flight costs so much\nas to be out of reach of most people's pockets. Microlight aviation is cheap\nand fun. Microlighting is also not\nvery hard, if you can learn to ride a bicycle you can learn to fly a micro light. This is helped by the\ninherent stability of the weight shift\ncontrol trainers: one of the weirdest\nsensations is taking your hands off all\nof the controls and finding nothing\nhappens (micro lights are less affected\nby weather than other forms of light\naviation).

At the end of the first round\nImperial were down 2-1 as Jones and\nRoberts lost to City's strong 1st couple and Morcos and Skipworth\nwon against City's3 rd pair.\nThe match score stood at 3-2 to\nImperial when Morcos and Skipworth\nlost a marathon match against the City\n1st couple 3-6, 6-4, 15-13 after\nholding a match point. In the final\nround, needing to win 2 out of the 3\nremaining matches Imperial scraped\nhome victorious.\nJulian Jones and John Roberts look\nlike developing into a very formidable\npair, although their combined height\nof 11 feet leaves them vulnerable to\ntactical lobbing. The new partnership\nof Hill and Lavelle demonstrates the\ndepth of talent in the IC Tennis Club,\ncoasting against City's equivalent\ncouple before losing narrowly to the\nvociferous American 2nd couple. It\nwas left to Morcos and Skipworth in\nthe deciding match of the day against\nthe Americans to demonstrate the\nfiner points of grass court tennis and\ntake the match 6-2, 6-0.\nThe result guarantees IC a place in\nthe U AU knock-out rounds regardless\nof the result of our match this\nWednesday against UCL.\nRIFLE & PISTOL\nAlways in search of new challenges\nthe pistol team took up standard\npistol, an Olympic discipline not\nnormally shot at IC. As some match\npractice was needed before the\nBUSEF competition at the end of term\nwe challenged the Central Polytechnic\nof London to a match on March 4.\nStandard pistol is a timed discipline\nwith a string of 5 shots taken in 150,\n20 and 10 second. These are repeated\n4 times for each time period. This\ngives an individual score out of 600\nand in this competition the best 4\nscores out of 6 were to count.\nThe teams, in the order they shot,\nwere:\nIC Central Poly\nPaul Deeks Michael Wolf\nIan Draper Rob Silverstone\nAndrew Jones Robin Razzel\nMike Lacey Pete Kershaw\nAndrew Lane Adrian Mitchell\nRoger Winskill Ross\nAfter introductions, and a late arrival\nby Ross (who didn't have time to tell\nus his other name), tha shooting\nbegan.\nSome good scores were shot by\nCentral Poly, their best by Siberstone\nat 331, gave them an overall score of\n1209. These were, however, well\nbeaten by an impressive IC total of\n2050 with the best score of 521 from\nRoger Winskill. A bout of era tic shooting meant their best was almost\nas good as our worst but a good team\nperformance gave counting scores all\nover 500.\nAfter such an emphatic win (again)\nwe look forward to a return match\nsoon. Finally we are still looking for\nmembers and welcome anyone, come\ndown to the range any lunchtime to\njoin.

    "content": "Editorial\nImagine a computer manufacturer\nwho has to pay out vast sums every\nyear because its computers are\nunreliable and break down while\nunder warranty. Any sensible\nobserver would tell the company to\nspend some money on its production\nline and its quality control in order to\nmake its computers more reliable;\nfewer repairs would lead to a long\nterm saving. If the company actually\nchose to cut its losses by sacking staff\nand eco nom ising in its complaints\ndepartment, we would rightly regard\nthe management as stupid and\nincompetent. Yet something very\nsimilar is happening with the Health\nService.\nThe Health Service is (supposedly)\nbecoming an increasing strain on\nGovernment spending. At the same\ntime the British public are becoming\nincreasingly unhealthy. The\nGovernment has responded by\nrestricting the amount of money spent\nby the hospitals. What they ought to\nbe doing is taking action to improve\npublic health. Last year, while the\nHealth Education Council spent \u00a31.4\nmillion on a campaign called Look\nAfter Your Heart (this is about one per\ncent of the advertising budget of the\ntobacco industry), the NHS spent\nmore than \u00a3400 million treating those\nwho had heart disease. Britains have\nsome of the least healthy hearts in the\nworld (two British regions, Scotland\nand Northern Ireland, actually top the\nworld league for heart attacks per\nhead of population).\nThe Government's free-market\ninstincts seem to prevent it fulfilling\nits duty to the public. Nutritional\nlabelling of food has been rejected by\nministers (contrary to their scientists\nadvice) because the powerful food\nlobby were worried that telling people\nwhat was in their food might put them\noff buying it. The Common\nAgricultural Policy and the Ministry\nof Agriculture have conspired to\nsub sid is e the farmers who produce\nsome of the least healthy foods\n(hence, for example, the butter\nmountain). In fact, almost all policies\nrelating to agriculture are designed to\nbenefit the producers and they have\nhistorically completely ignored the\nnutritional needs of consumers.\nRecently those scientists who work\non areas related to public health have\nbeen starting to agree more than ever\nbefore that it is possible to improve\npublic health by concerted\ngovernment action. Several scientific\nreports (on diet and health, the cause*\nof heart disease and so on) have\nproduced urgent suggestions for\naction. However, the politicians seem\ntoo concerned with keeping public\nspending under control in the short\nterm to realise that they could save a fortune in the long term by spending\nUNDER can make more money encouraging\nus to eat an unhealthy diet. And no\nscientist should allow their opinions\nto be bought by vested interests.\nIt requires a lot of effort to create\na healthy society, but in the end it is\nworth it. We need government action\nTHE MICROSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nmoney now to encourage us to be\nmore healthy.\nWe need Government action\nbecause the food industry makes too\nmuch money out of unhealthy foods\nand is therefore willing to promote\nbad habits by powerful advertising.\nEven the tobacco industry (who\ncannot claim that its products are\ngood for you) is still allowed to spend\na fortune every year encouraging us\nto kill ourselves. They get away with\nit because they also spend a lot of\nmoney lobbying MPs in an attempt to\nstop them banning the advertising.\nOther slightly less disreputable\ncompanies, such as sugar refiners,\nhave misused scientific results to\nmake their products seem more\ninnocuous than they actually are. One\ncompany even had one of its own\nexperts make a highly publicised\nspeech claiming that children who eat\ntoo much muesli were suffering from\nmalnutrition because of lack of sugar.\nWe will never build a healthy society\nif we follow the advice of those who\nto promote the public knowledge of\nthe facts of nutrition and health. We\nalso need legislation to force food\ncompanies to tell us what is really in\ntheir products so we know what is\ngood for us and what isn't. We should\naim for a society where people are\nwell enough informed about science\nto judge for themselves how to be\nhealthy.\nIt is good to live in a society where\nthe ill will always be looked after, but\nit is better to live in a society where\nfew people fall ill. We live in a country where the cost of caring for\nthe ill is becoming so large that some\npeople think the state can no longer\nafford to pay it. However, the best\nway to preserve the NHS is not to\nkeep investing more money in treating\nillness (though some may be needed\nin the short term), but to spend the\nmoney in an effort to create a more\nhealthy society. Investing in health\neducation now will ensure that, in the\nlong term, we can afford to look after\nour ill.\nVampire chemical\nkills bugs\nA new idea in chemical weaponry has\nbeen invented by chemists at the\nUniversity of Illinois: it is an\ninsecticide that only kills during the\nday. At first sight this may not seem\nlike such a good idea, since crop-eating insects are likely to be just as\nhungry at night as during the day:\nwhy should we call a truce if they\ndon't! However, the nature of the\nvampire chemicals may make them\nmore useful than other bug-killers.\nThe basic chemical ingredient of\nthe Illinois chemists vampire soup is\na compound called delta-amino levu li nic acid (delta-ALA to its\nfriends). Because of its similarity to\nsome cellular building-blocks, it is\nunlikely that insects can evolve\nresistance to it. In fact, it works\nbecause they absorb large quantities\nof it at night and then, when the sun\ncomes up, light (aided by the other\nchemicals of the soup) initiates a chain\nreaction that transforms the delta-A LA into another rather nastier\ncompound called proto-porphyrin\nwhich buggers cell membranes when\nit gets into the wrong place in them.\nOutside the insects or in the absence\nof light the delta-ALA is harmless and\nrapidly degrades in the environment.\nInsects that have absorbed the\ncompound survive normally until\ndawn when they last about ten\nseconds before spinning around\nviolently throwing up and dying\n(unless they can find a dark coffin\nfilled with consecrated earth).\nThe other additives to the chemical\nsoup can be readily modified to make\nthe mixture highly specific for one\npest. The process of making specific\ncocktails is easy and thousands have\nalready been tried. This is a significant improvement over more\nconventional pesticides where costly\nand slow trial-and-error alterations to\nthe basic killing-molecule are the only\nway to create species-specificity.\nIt all goes to show that even\nwatching old horror films can suggest\nideas for new chemistry.\nIf there is anything you would like to\nsee on this page then now is the time\nto contact me: there are only a handful more issues of FELIX before\nthe summer. Suggestions, ideas,\narticles, abuse to Steve Black, Chem\nPG or the FELIX Office.\n6 Friday 13th May 1988 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "the editor, Liz Holford, has brought out three smaller editions which have\nbeen distributed free with Felix. I think it will take a little time for the\nnew style Phoenix to catch on, but I think an Arts magazine is essential\nin a place like IC. There has certainly been more involvement from\nstudents with the new style of publication.\nPostgraduate Prospectus\nThis used to be called the Postgraduate Handbook but Postgraduate\nprospectus is more correct: it is aimed at final year students thinking\nabout a postgraduate course and gives a student's view of postgraduate\nlife, along with a lot of information which cannot be obtained elsewhere.\nIt was produced by Alan Barnett, again to the usual high standard.\nDistribution again is a problem; this year piles were left in Departments\nfor final year students to pick up, accompanied by a Poster campaign.\nThis has been fairly successful, and I think it has fulfilled its purpose well.\nA.P. Supplement\nBecause we only produce the Alternative Prospectus every two years,\nand it is produced for the year ahead's entry, parts of the current AP\ncould be three years out of date. To counter this, money saved from the\nAP last year was carried over to produce a four page supplement, which\nwas mailed out with the remaining copies of the full A.P. The supplement\nwas produced by Martyn Peck, but was greatly hampered by Dep. Reps\nnot bothering to write anything.\nThe experiment of having an AP every other year, with a supplement in\nbetween needs to be looked at very carefully to see if it has been a success, or whether there is a method that could produce a new AP\nevery year at reasonable cost. I hope this is discussed in depth next year.\nThanks\nFinally, I would like to thank the following, as well as all the members of\nthe Board (especially the editors); Jen, Kathy, Pat and Reggie, Dean and\nRose for their unending help and patience with us all throughout the year;\nAlan, Chas and Ian; Simon Langan for being an excellent Senior\nTreasurer, Nigel and Kamala, who keep the Board running, and finally all\nthe students for reading, listening, watching and perhaps even taking part\nin a publication.\nChris Martin,\nPublications'Board Chair 1986/88.\nRecreational Clubs Committee Chair\nNeil McCluskey\nThe last academic year for the RCC has been totally non-academic in its\nactivities but virtually academic in its running. I have had a fairly easy\ntask in running the RCC with considerable help from the rest of the RCC\nExec and a great deal of co-operation from the ci ub s themselves. It's amazing what they do when threaten to freeze their grants.\nMost clubs have been very active throughout the year. Notably: YHA six\ntimes requesting a tent, six times denied, still doing brilliantly.\nMountaineering managing to devour a number of table decorations as part\nof their annual dinner.\nPhotographic society back in the picture increasing their membership on\nlast year by large amounts.\nParachuting attracting many people willing to pay lots of money to throw\nthemselves out of planes.\nOther mentions should go to the new clubs within RCC, these being\nBeetlesoc and Computer Graphics, with Debsoc halfway to transferring\nfrom SCAB to RCC.\nFinancially the clubs within RCC are managing to spend every penny we\nhave with quite a bit of money going tours. Some eight clubs ran tours\nduring the Easter vacation, putting a he vy strain on the Union vans and\non Chas Jackson.\nNext year's RCC Exec was elected, or should I say merely ratified, on\nThursday 5th May. With an enormous turn-out of both incoming and\noutgoing club chairmen the meeting still only lasted for thirty minutes!!\nWith three out of the five posts going to Scout and Guide, the other two\nbeing outdoor clubs as well it looks like the indoor clubs are going to be\nquiet, shy and retiring for the coming year. I hope they prove me wrong.\nAfter splashes, splutters and fits and starts the following clubs never\nreally got off the ground: Graffitti, Surf and Water-skiing. Graffitti have\nreformed but have yet to claim any money, strange though that may\nseem. I hope next year Surf and Water-skiing will be continued.\nLastly I'd like to thank the UFC and the Union sabbaticals for giving us\nlots of do sh when we needed it and for not bugger ing up the meetings by\nattending!!\nNeil McClusky\nRCC Chairman 1987/88\nSocial Clubs Committee Chair\nDavid Clements\n1. Introduction\nSCC is a strange conglomeration of clubs whose interests vary from\nTransendental Meditation to the City of London, and many of whose\ngroups you might expect to be in conflict with one another, such as the\nConservative Socirty and the Socialist Workers. However, SCC, as the\nbody which provides funding and overall administration to the 32 clubs\nwithin it, does function well, and overseeing it has been a rewarding job.\n2. SCC Business\nThis year the total membership of SCC clubs amounted to some 2500\npeople, about 3/4 of the total undergraduate population of IC. As always\nhappens, some clubs fade out of existance, and new ones form. This\nyear we have made a net gain in clubs, with SWSS (Socialist Workers),\nRockSoc, SLAGS (Student L,,,oi an and Gay Soc) and GLC (the Greater\nLondon Club) forming while Polish and CND have disbanded. Christian\nUnion has also been lost to SCC, but more of that later.\nAs is usually the case, SCC has the largest clubs in college, this year the\nlaurels are shared by Industrial Society and Science Fiction Soc. each\nwith 400 members. Of the religious clubs, the Islamic Soc should be\nmentioned since its membership of about 250 makes it bigger than\nalmost all of the other religious clubs put together. The Islamic Soc\ncommittee are clearly providing a much needed service. The Greater\nLondon club is also an unusual phenomenon in gaining a membership of\n170 in just its first year of existance. Rob Conn, their founder, and\ncommittee should be congratulated for their hard work, and I'm sure far\nfewer of us will now 'live in ignorance'.\nOn a rather less mercenary note than membership figures, a club which\nhas had a notable success this year is the IC Amnesty Group whose\nadopted Prisonner of Conscience, Ivan Starovoit, a Jehova's Witness\nimprisoned in the USSR, has finally been released. One other notable\nsuccess, introduced last year, but only put into full operation this year,\nhas been the SCC video system, now used by clubs throughout the\nUnion.\nOn the organisation side of SCC I'd very much like to thank the vice\nchairman, Sarah Bunney, for her hard work this year; things would not\nhave gone so smoothly without her. Our two senior treasurers this year\nalso deserve thanks for putting up with the boring nec ess it ites of cheque\nsigning sessions and book keeping. Nigel Graham (Civ. Eng.) has been\ntreasurer for several years, but had to give up the job half way thorough\nthe year. He has certainly contributed a great deal to the running of S CC over the years and shall certainly be missed. A presentation pot will soon\nbe arriving, though probably not by the AGM, unfortunately. Dr. John\nCosgrave (Geology) then kindly took up the job of HST at short notice,\nand has been doing an excellent job ever since. Thanks are also due to\nJen Hardy-Smith and Brian Lloyd-Davies in the Union office for making\nthe switch in our HSTs so smooth.\n3. Union Committees\nAs a major subcommittee of council (MSC), SCC sends its chairman to\nboth Council and Union Finance (UFC) meetings. Council, as the highest\ncommittee in the Union, second only to aUG M, gets through an awful lot\nof business, and its meetings tend to be very long. This has been\nespecially true this year with the very necessary Union reorganisation and\nmany other matters being discussed. One thing you can certainly say\nabout this year's president is that he doesn't let sleeping dogs lie, and I think future generations of IC students will benefit from this.\nThe only major item discussed on Council of direct r eleven ce to SCC this\nyear was the issue of the Christian Union. Briefly the issue here was that\nCU requires its members to sign a declaration of faith, and it was deemed\nthat this was contrary to the principle that any IC student can join any IC\nclub. As a result of this the CU are no longer a Union club, but are\norganising events outside Union auspices. This does not seem to be\nunduly affecting their activities, though of course they no longer have a Union grant, and I wish them every success. The restriction placed on\nmembership of CU is in fact imposed by an outside body, and the issue\nof restrictions on club membership resulting from external influences is a can of worms that is probably best left uno penned. As it is this may well\nbe an issue that could 'run and run'.\nThe Union Finance Committee (UFC), the body in contra l of the Union's purse strings, has rather more direct r eleven ce to SCC, since it is from\nthere that we get our money. The Union has been fairly well off this year,\nFELIX Annual Report '88 7\n\n"

    "content": "4. Union Committees and Meetings\na) UGMs: These have suffered from the age-old problem of in quo racy. Even the transfer to the JCR hasn't been as successful as hoped. The\npossible increase in attendances has been offset by problems in counting\nattendance and votes. One problem has been the general lack of\npublicity. One thing that I have noticed has been a lack of policy-forming\nmotions. My intention to produce a Composite Policy Statement may help\nthis situation.\nb) Council: All Councils have been quo rate this year, thank goodness.\nGenerally discussions have been of high quality, but as always have\ntended to go round in circles somewhat. Obviously there has been\ndiscussion on many important issues, particularly changes in the job\ndescriptions. I feel obliged to return to the age-old Hon See's problem\nabout the preparation of papers. Members still hand in reports and papers\nat the last minute. It takes a considerable length of time to prepare\npapers for Council, which people simply don't realise. It is particularly\nannoying when members submit material too late to be distributed and\nread before the meeting.\nc) MSCs: It's quite relaxing to attend committees which you don't have\nto minute. However, I haven't attended as many as I would like, mainly\ndue to pressures of time. Those I have attended have been well-run and\noften very interesting.\nd) Other Committees: The Minor Subcommittees are all minuted by the\nHon Sec, bar Academic Affairs. Union Finance Committee has been the\nlengthiest of these this year but has been chaired well by Alan Rose. I set\nup a more consistent style for the minutes, allowing for greater continuity\nbetween years. One problem has been the constant search for consistent\nUFC policy. As this is often set by precedent rather than in the form of\nmotions, it will be very difficult to set it in the form of a policy\nstatement, although very useful. House Committee has been very useful\nand active. Members have approached it in a refreshingly non-partisan\nmanner. They have seemed willing to address the problems in the\nBuilding, though hindered by College dragging its heels on improvements.\nWelfare Committee has had some useful discussions and External Affairs\nbusiness seems to have been conducted mainly through UGMs. It is very\nsad that Internal Services Committee hasn't met at all this year. Exec\nhasn't met as often as might be liked, and it seems now that this\nsituation should be rectified next year. It has shown itself willing to deal\nwith problems in a quiet manner 'between friends' and on occasion thus\nto create a smoother path than might otherwise be possible. Also\npancakes and maple syrup in the RSM President's room was a treat not\nto be missed.\nd) ULU GUC: As usual this has suffered from the problem of delegates\napproaching it from a political stand rather than from the interests of their\nmembers. Although I often agree with them, I still consider the primary\npu pose of student bodies to be that of looking after the interests of their\nmembers. Political discussion on outside matters is important, but should\nalways take second place. I.C. Union is regarded of somewhat of a maverick because of its difference of approach. Although some people\nrespect us for this, many have the rather dogmatic view that we are baby\neating fascists merely because we are Imperial and not in NUS. I still hold\nout hope whilst such people as Fat Norm (ULU VP F&A) are in student\nunions, but it does nark me a bit.\n5. College Committees\na) Governing Body/ F&E: Surprisingly, there have been some relevant\nmatters at these bodies. The College deficit and Finance Section problems\ntogether with the St Mary's merger have been major issues. There is a promise of more to come with problems due to College policy on\nrecruitment of overseas students being emphasised. One of my best\nmemories is of the chairman of the Governing Body almost ignoring the\nDean of Guilds to tell myself and Alan a set of amusing and racy\nanecdotes.\nb) Parking and Traffic: Again the subject of parking fees has raised it's ugly head. However we provided a set of proposals to raise the money\nwithout hitting those least able to pay.\nc) Joint Trade Unions: Recently I have attended these instead of Syd,\nthe main subject being the proposed closure of Central stores.\n6. Other Jobs\na) Parking Permits: These are a major source of grief. However much\nyou explain, people still accuse the committee of allocating them unfairly,\nand still expect you to have a secret supply long after they have been\nallocated. I'm sure the allocation su stem could be made more efficient ,\nbut I'm also sure that we allocated them as fairly as possible.\nb) Commem Ball: This is something that I could have organised much\nbetter with the benefit of hindsight. All indications are that next year's Ball will be something very special, and organisation is well under way.\nc) Elections: These were very hard work, and I'm quite frankly amazed\nthat they went without major hitch. I was very disappointed at being\nunable to organise a ballot box at St Marys, which would have been a nice gesture on the eve of merger.\nConclusions\nI 've enjoyed my year of despotic power, although it is far from over. I feel that it has stood me in good stead for the future, and my main regret\nhas the strained relations between the Office and Felix. I only wish that I could have had my present level of knowledge ten months ago, and that\nI'd had the perks of any self respecting despot. All I can offer in\nmitigation is that I have always tried to do what I felt was right.\nThankyou, goodbye and goodluck to the Union.\nCredits\nUnlike Gutman, I have managed to retain my hair. This is largely due to\nmy colleagues, Syd and Alan and to those amazing fixtures, the\npermanent staff. Jen, Pat, Kathy, Reggie and Dave have all made the\nshouldering of burdens a little easier. Lastly, thankyou to Ken Weale for\nsome good chats about cricket and to Jelly for some good beer.\nChas Jackson\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nCharles Brereton\nIn this annual report I have summarised the major ache ive ment s of the\nyear and also plans for the rest of this term and the next academic year.\nMy work as Academic Affairs Officer is conducted, on the whole, within\n(i) College and (ii) Union committees and (iii) activities directly related to\nthese, so the report is in three main sections.\nA. COLLEGE COMMITTEES\n1. Undergraduate Studies Committee: Luke Walker, City and Guilds Union\nAAO 1 985-86 said that this committee would form the most enjoyable\npart of any AAO's work; in retrospect I am inclined to agree with him.\nUnder the able stewardship of Professor David Blow the committee has\nprogressed from strength to strength. The members of the Committee, all\nwithout exception, are genuinely concerned about undergraduate\nteaching. The Committee has divided itself into two Working Groups,\nlooking at Teaching Evaluation and Student Needs.\nTeaching Evaluation: this group is responsible for the Lecturer Evaluation\nQuestionnaire, which had a pilot run early in the Spring Term. This was\nnot without its problems, and having seen a few of the analyses of the\nresults I am agreement with the recommendation of the Committee,\nnamely that a pilot run(s) is necessary to iron out the difficulties. I look\nforward to the Questionnaire next year - at last students will be taken\nseriously in all departments where the lecturing is not up to scratch. I hope that all the time and trouble which Students and Staff have taken\nover the past three years will have been worthwhile. My thanks must go\nto Professor David Ewins who chairs the group and Vernon McClure\n(Deputy Registrar) for their hard work.\nStudent Needs: This working group has been looking into the problems of\nstudents' motivation (or lack of it), workloads and failure rates. This\ngroup has not been as active as I would have liked; however the group\nwill be looking into these areas in more detail in the next academic year.\n2. Board of Studies: This \"committee\", consisting of Heads of\nDepartments, Deans, Professors et al is basically a rubber-stamping body\nfor its subcommittees policies regarding course changes etc. and as such\nis quite boring. Nevertheless it is the highest Academic Board in the\nCollege, so student representation on it is vital. Most of the items which\nare discussed are passed with a nod! However, on contentious items\nsuch as the questionnaire or failure rates, I have been quick to put the\nstudents' point of view.\n3. Admissions Policy Committee: College policy on admissions\nprocedures, standards and external publications for prospective students\nis decided here amongst 14 admissions tutors and 4 student reps. The\nbig problem of recruiting more students has been addressed though out the year. In particular, analysing students' reasons for declining offers\nmade has been useful. I was not pleased to hear of the problems which\nCollege is having getting offer/rejection decisions transmitted to\n2 Annual Report '88 FELIX\n\n"

The annual Engineers'\nDinner & Dance held at one of\nLondon's top hotels always sells out\n(in this year's case in 36 hours). It\nwas decided last year that City &\nGuilds should hold a second Dinner\n& Dance, out of the West End, on not\nsuch a large scale as the Engineers'\nBall, which would mean it would be\nsubstantially cheaper. Our aim was to\ncater for those members of IC who\nfeel that Dinner & Dances are just a little too expensive, and for those who\nmissed out on getting a ticket to the\nEngineers' Ball.\nThe result of our aim is the May\nBall.

The first spot which\ncomes to everybody's mind is the\nLatin Quarter, a place where you will\nfind most Parisian students. Lately the\nplace; has become invaded by\nfashionable shops but you will still\nfind great places to eat especially near\nthe Metro St Michel where all the\nNorth African restaurants are located.\nGo into one of them and ask for a 'couscous', a really stuffy dish\ncomposed of semolina, chilly sauce,\nvegetables, veal, chicken and chilly\nsausages, in fact it is so substantial\nthat you will get chock-a block quite\neasily. While we are on the 'Arab\norientated' food try the Lebanese\nrestaurant situated in the Rue Sauton\n(Haubert Hautualite tube station). It\nis a take-away restaurant but instead\nof taking-away soggy French fries\nyou can enjoy great local food. Even\nif it is not French food you can't ignore it because Paris is a multiracial city. Now let's talk French\nfood! If you have 'un cr eux'( empty\nstomach) then go to a Boulangerie\n(you'll always find one within 5\nminutes walking distance from where\nyou are) and eat cro is ants aux\nam andes, pain aux raisins, tar telet tes aux fruits, e clair s au chocolat or a selection of sav our ies such as\nsandwich e erudite or quiche lorraine.\nIf you want to find a good cafe with\na nice 'ambiance' and local people try\n'le Marais' in the 12th arrondissement. Try to avoid modern\nbras series especially those near 'Le\nChamps Elysees where everything is\nexpensive. Now to finish here is a list\nof some great inexpensive restaurants:\nChez Chartier: Rue Montmartre.\nHere you will get 'cuisine familial e' for about 30 Francs, but be careful-meals are not served after 9pm. La Fresque: 100 Rue Rambuteau\n(near Les Halles). Only for lunch, for\nabout 50F you'll get a main course\nwith meat and sauce.'\nLe Petit Vatel: Rue Lobineau\n(behind St Germaine market). The\nstory goes like this: Vatel was the\ncook of Louis XVI and he killed\nhimself because of a sauce that he\nmade which that tasted horrible. The\nrestaurant's like a big kitchen and\nthere's only one table so it's easy to\nmake friends. You might have to\nqueue to get a seat but it's worth it\nbecause the cost is 50F for a whole\nmeal.\nLes Artists: At the corner of Rue de\nSiene. Just ask for Tarte Tatin it is the\ngreatest in the world.\nNow remember that service is\nincluded in the bill.\nBon Appetit,\nOlivier Waser.\nNext week, Yishu Nanda will be\nback with his special recipe for\nStrawberry Mousse.\nSummer Vacation\nResidence Forms\nNow available from the\nSummer Accommodation\nOffice\nClosing date: Friday June 3rd Unfortunately places are strictly limited\nThe\nRoyal School of\nMines Journal\n1988\nThe RS MJ(1988 edition) will be\nprinted in June this year.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the brain lining which\ncan affect the brain, being caused by several different types of germs.\nOne of the most serious bacterial types is Meningococcal Menningitis,\nthe strain in the recent outbreak in Gloucestershire, which caused 158\ndeaths in the 1,090 cases reported in 1987.\nThe germ lives naturally in the back\nof the throat and is spread like colds\nby droplet transmission when\ncoughing, leading to flu-like\nsymptoms, a severe headache\nworsened by movement, a stiff neck,\ndiscomfort from bright light and\nsometimes a rash from associated\nseptic a emi a. Treatment is immediate\nhospital is ation with intra ve neo us antibiotics.\nThe present case is most likely to\nbe an isolated one, according to the\nHealth Centre, as most secondary\ncases are reported within four days,\nthough the incubation period is two\nto ten days.

    "content": "AN NUA President\nSydney Harbour-Bridge\nRegretfully I am not in a position yet to write an annual report because of\nongoing matters which will have to be reported in full.\nSydney Harbour-Bridge\nDeputy President\nAlan Rose\nMr Alan Rose has written his report but has decided not to submit it at\nthis moment in time. It will be published in a future FELIX, as will Mr\nSydney Harbour-Bridge's report.\nHonorary Secretary\nCharles Jackson\nIntroduction\nAt this time last year, Dave Colley (my revered predecessor l suggested\nthat I write my report in much the same format as both his and the\nprevious Hon Sees. In view of the wholesale change in the job\ndescriptions and the extended working year I have decided to follow that\napproach as much as possible but adding in my analysis of the situation\nand my approach towards leaving matters in a fit state to be handed\nover.\nFirst I would like to say a few words of a general nature about the\ncurrent job description. Being almost entirely an administrative post, the\nbiggest problem has been the inevitable learning curve. Hopefully the\nchange in job description will offset this effect. Certainly something had\nto change.\n1. Transport\na) General Administration: Last year saw the demise of shared costing\nfor weekend bookings. This year I tried to run a system where outside\nhire vans were booked as second vehicles for those clubs requiring more\nthan one. However, demand has been unexpectedly high and this system\nhas had its problems with 'one-off users and certain clubs who felt that\nthey were treated unfairly. However, I have encouraged greater flexibility\nin the use of cars and panel vans. This itself has meant that I have dealt\nwith more hire firms than last year, not all of whom are very quick at\nsending invoices. A particular problem that I am trying to alleviate is that\nuntil recently it has been difficult to provide regular figures on the usage\nof the transport account. I am currently working with Reggie to ease this\ntask by the breakdown of expenditure into various subheadings and the\nuse of the micro to speed up calculations. One problem with ascertaining\nthe current position is the lack of an exact carry over figure for the\nbeginning of the year. My own calculations have given a working figure,\nbut sight of the audited accounts would be much better.\nb) Minibuses: This year has seen the delivery of one seventeen seater,\nFLW and the order and eventual delivery of a thirteen seater, FLM. AHU\nhas continued to give problems with the steering, clutch, battery and\nchoke. It has now got a problem with the loss of the synchro mesh on the\nlower gears. OLE suffered a major breakdown, merely because the driver\ndidn't check the water level in the radiator and then proceeded to\ncontinue driving with the oil warning light on. This year I was hoping to\nexpand to six vans but problems with AHU have made this unlikely.\nc) Outside Hire: This year I have used Budget and Translocation to\nprovide more flexibility. However, Translocation can be relied upon to\nsend bills swiftly in contrast to Budget. I have also experimented with\nCrown Supplies. Outside hire always produces problems, for which there\nare no easy solutions.\nd) Accidents: There have been two major accidents, to BLR and an\noutside hire car. These have caused great hassle due to delays and\narguments about the payment of VAT on claims.\ne) Vehicle Insurance: Nat West Insurance Services have been very\nhelpful with advice and the willingness to issue cover notes at short\nnotice. However, the same cannot be said of whoever in the Motor\nInsurers Association rang up the repair ers to say that we were liable to\npay VAT on repairs. As we aren't, this caused me considerable grief,\nfj Problems an the Ho.U on: The first and most serious problem is a government proposal to bring us into line with the EEC by requiring an\nHGV or PSV licence to drive minibuses. At present we use minibus\npermits to exempt us from this requirement on^the grounds that usage is\nnot for 'hire or reward'. As this is planned to happen quite soon, we are\nleft in a difficult position regarding the purchase of new vans. The second\nproblem is the running of the transport system next year. It is rather\nunrealistic to expect the Union Manager to take on this area immediately,\neven if it is desirable for him to do so. The strengthening of the Transport\nOfficer system is one possible way forward.\n2. Insurance\na) Clubs Insurance: The \u00a3100 excess on claims has been a considerable\nburden this year. However the low number of claims may help us in two\nways. Firstly I hope to be able to renegotiate the premium and excess\ndue to the improvement in the claims history. Secondly, it has taken\nlonger to learn this aspect of the job than certain others. I have cleared\nup some long outstanding claims, and hope to be able to clear up others\ndating from last year. There seems to be woeful ignorance amongst clubs\nas to insurers' requirements when making claims. This is understandable,\nbut someone should really have produced a set of guidelines, as is my\nintention. The other problem is that of inventories. I think that it is\ninadequate to attempt the production of a complete new inventory at the\nbeginning of the year. The Union Office is very busy and club committees\nare new to the job. My solution, which I hope to implement, is to store\ninventories on the micro com pu.r in such a way as to allow easy\nupdating. This will also enable production of an inventory for each club to\namend at the end of the year in time for the calculation of the new\npremium.\nb) Halls of Residence Insurance: This has arguably been one of my\nmost successful areas this year. It is certainly one into which I have put\nconsiderable time and effort. Last year the procedure for handling claims\nwas changed but unfortunately my predecessor was not informed of all\nthe requirements. This led to large delays and a considerable backlog of\nclaims. Having managed to convince the insurers that that the delay in\nsubmission of claims was due to College and not the claimants, I set\nabout clearing up the backlog. I have been successful in clearing up\nvirtually all of last year's claims, and most of this year's. Unfortunately\nthis required a flood of information from my office to the insurers, which\ncould be causing delays in the handling of claims. The insurers have also\nbecome noticeably more pernick e ty in dealing with claims. The insurance\nbrokers at Alexander Stenhouse have been a tremendous help, both in\ndealing with my vast amount of enquiries, and in chasing up the insurers.\nA special word of thanks must go to Pete Higgs, who helped me file the\nmass/mess of correspondence from last year.\nA connected task which I have performed this year has been the entering\nof details of claims for the last two years on the micro. This is enabling\nme easily to perform analyses such as changes in the claims history, and\nthe relation of security changes to changes in the number of thefts. A full\nreport on this is being prepared.\nc) Linstead Hall Basement Sale: This has been such a problem as to\ndeserve special mention. Although it has dropped out of the headlines,\nthe task of gaining recompense for those students who lost possessions\nis not easy. The various complications arising from the sale have taken up\nmuch of my time, and the whole sorry affair still has not been brought to\na satisfactory conclusion. Because it is still an ongoing matter, *here is\nnot much of detail that I can say without possibly prejudicing c \"standing\nclaims. When the matter is finally settled, I will take great pleasure in\ntelling the full story, from my viewpoint.\nWhen looking at annual reports for 1980/81, I found the quote \"The\nEndsleigh Halls of Residence Policy has caused us some problems this\nyear, with the largest being the disappearance of luggage from Linstead\nBasement.\" Plus ca change, plus ca meme chose.\n3. Duplicating, Photocopying and Stationary\na) Duplicating: The Gestetner and stencil cutter have been in working\norder for most of the year. However their presence has led to a considerable number of requests from clubs for duplicating. Also I have\nduplicated RSM Newsletters and one issue of Guildsheet. I have reduced\nthe emphasis on use of this process for Union minutes and general office\nbump h.I have mainly used the photocopiers for minutes, leaving the\ngeste t ner for UGM papers.\nb) Photocopiers: Both photocopiers have been replaced this year by\nmore suitable and versatile machines. The copy card system on the main\nphotocopier has been very successful, and will ease both billing and the\nprevention of free photocopying by unscrupulous individuals,\nc) Stationary Supplies: Generally I have used Central Stores for supply\nof envelopes, pens and paper. However, the possible closure of this\nfacility has made the investigation of other sources more urgent. We have\nreceived interesting quotes from a supplier of recycled paper, and hope to\ntie it in to an initiative to organise recycling of paper throughout College\nand its environs.\nFELIX Annual Report '88 1\n\n"

I feel the time could be\ncoming where we will have to advise applicants not to come to London\nunless they are financially secure on their own.\nThe Housing Bill\nThe theory is that with the deregulation of tenancies, that there will be a great expansion of the rented sector because landlords will have more\nrights. This expansion is supposed to lead to a lowering of rents to\n'market levels'. The problem is that the demand for rented\naccommodation in London is so great, when this bill is passed, rents are\nsure to skyrocket. The bill removes many of the rights of the tenants\nagainst unfair landlords and is, on the whole, a bad thing. I feel this is\nsomething we should be focusing on in the coming year.\nHuman Rights Week Simon Boscher and Amnesty have been working on a major Human\nRights Week to be held next February. Despite hassles from those\nwonderful people at ULU, we have been working to get it University-wide\nrecognition. We hope to be taking a motion to the next GUC and\ncooperating with ULU and other' colleges in'its organisation.\nUL U ULU can be a useful forum for debate, ,a powerful lobbying body, a good\ncentral union for the University. ULU can also be a great big floundering\nidiot, a puppy for NUS London to do with what it will, and a political\nbickering shop. We try to encourage the former and discourage the latter.\nULU sabbaticals seem impossible to get hold of, and useful when you do.\nLast week I took a tube out to Malet Street, and did more useful work in\nan afternoon than in three weeks over the telephone.\nWhat we really need ULU for is as a source of information. We caught\non far too late what was happening with GERBill and gained much from a 'borrowed' NUS briefing. As we are outside NUS we need ULU to provide\nan up to date news briefing service. They have a new research officer,\nwe should press the new exec for information.\nNUS\nDebSoc's debate last term showed that there is considerable interest in\nour students as to what NUS has to say. I feel we should invite more\npeople from NUS next year and perhaps re-open the debate on af filli ation. We have ignored them for seven years.\nSpeakers etc. I wish that political societies would inform me in advance of interesting\nspeakers on topics concerning students. A case in point, SocSoc invited\nan MP who was on the committee stage of GERBill at the time\nconcessions were being made. About 20 people were there, half staff.\nIn general we should have more political speakers, for example, at\nUGMs.\nTo Close It's been fun.

Last year \u00a314,700 was donated and despite inheriting\nmany problems from last year's chairman this year's total is set to exceed\n\u00a325,000.\nThe year has been characterised by the continuing success of the\n'traditional' events such as Monopoly, Tiddlywinks and most of the Rag\nWeek events, along with the introduction of many new events and the\nresumption of collections under an Imperial College Union Charity Rag\nlicence. Collecting licences were obtained for Canterbury,\nWolverhampton, Chelmsford and Bedford. These collections passed off\nsuccessfully without incident and I can now look forward to the time\nwhen the Metropolitan Police will allow us to hold London licences after\nour seven years in the wilderness.\nFor the first time this year we decided to operate an incentive scheme.\nThis began by offering Rag t shirts to those who collected \u00a3100 and\nsweatshirts for totals of \u00a3250. During the spring term it became apparent\nthat these were no longer realistic incentives and so jumpers for \u00a3600\nand tankards for \u00a31000 were added to the list. At the time of writing\ntwo people have earned tankards and it is anticipated that by the end of\nthe year five people will have passed the \u00a31000 mark.\nThe only un savoury event of the year was Drink-a pub-dry which took\nplace in the ULU bar, Mergers. Unfortunately the reports that were\nwritten in London Student were highly exaggerated but the situation was\nsolved very quickly when I spoke to the ULU sabbaticals. Since Drink-a pub dry doesn't raise any money for Rag it has been decided that this\nevent will not take place next year. Morphy Day is also to be dropped,\nthis is due to lack of interest.\nThe end of h he spring term was livened up by the serving of an\ninjunction upon myself over some allegations that were allegedly made\nagainst London Rag '88. This injunction was later lifted. The sad part of\nthe whole event was that when I was last in touch with London Rag '88\nit looked as though it was going to lose a lot of money and would need\nbailing out by Intermediate Technology, the charity it was hoping to\nsupport. I will not say 'I told you so' but...\nIt now only leaves me to say thank you to all those who have helped\nRag over the last year and to pass on my best wishes and good luck to\nFiona Nicholas as she takes over the most rewarding job in College.

    "content": "Mr Alan Rose, Deputy President of Imperial College Union, has written an\nopen letter concerning his position with respect to annual reports and\nallegations that have been made against him about his responsibility for\nthe Union Snack Bar and Bar.\nThat I, as Deputy President, bear a global responsibility\nfor the Union's bar and catering activities as a sabbatical officer is without question and in this regard\nI am prepared to be called to account to justify my role\nwithin any part of the management structure.\nThe decision of the Executive Committee to back the\nrecommendation of the self-styled 'investigation\ncommittee' in the removal of the bar and catering\nactivities from my remit implies an instrumental\nresponsibility for the apparent stock shortages\nexperienced by both outlets. This is a position which I cannot accept.\nThe matters which the Executive were invited to\nconsider related to a number of complaints made\nlargely by persons who also bear administrative,\nfinancial and legal responsibilities for the Union trading\noutlets. None of these complaints would implicate me\ndirectly in the stated shortfalls even if they could be\nsubstantiated which, for the main part, they cannot.\nThe only formal allegation made against me is one of\n'gross mismanagement' a term so suitably vague that it\nmay be interpreted to mean anything from dishonesty\nto gross incompetence by anyone not priv vy to the\ndetails of the 'investigation' process.\nIt was alleged that I countenance the practise of\nafter hours drinking which I do not. I have helped the\nbar manager to clear the bar on a number of occasions\nand have rep remanded him in the past for allowing the\nconsumption of alcohol during the afternoon. To back\nup this allegation it was offered as evidence that on a stated night I was locked in the Union Bar drinking with\nthe staff until well into the morning when in fact I can\nconclusively prove that I was in Beit Hall.\nIt was alleged that I acted in defiance of licence es' instructions in allowing 'undesirable' individuals to work\nbehind the bar in relation to one particular person. I did\nnot wish to act on the basis of someone else's personal animosity towards a person who I considered\nto be a valuable asset to the bar but would have\naccepted sound professional reasons or an explicit\nstatement debarring him. No reasons have ever been\nforthcoming and every instruction affecting him has\nbeen carried out to the letter. He was never employed\nby the bar after an instruction was issued and has not\nset foot behind the bar after a further instruction was\nissued.\nThe delays in the production of financial information\nrelating to trading outlets has been cited as my specific\nresponsibility. Providing detailed trading accounts is\nsomething which I am neither required nor qualified to\ndo. Whilst I could have chased some people harder for\nfigures in the Autumn term and perhaps even produced\na few raw figures myself, I was engaged in a great\nmany other activities including organising the\nrecruitment of a finance officer who I believed would\nbe able to produce exactly the kind of detailed\ninformation which was needed. Given that we were all\nconcerned about the standing of the snack bar, raw\nfigures such as the sales figures produced by the Union\nAdministrator (which she could have produced at the\ncommittee at any time) or bank statements may not\nhave told the full story and could easily have lead to\nthe wrong conclusions. For example, a cash fi ow problem in November would have been consistent with\nexpanding into the area or formal dinners where we\nhad invested quite a lot of money but were not seeing\nreturns as the bills had not yet been paid. If this was,\nhowever, symptomatic of a greater problem, we\nneeded last year's accounts (which the College had not\nfinished) and the advice of a professional (who was\ndue to start in the near future). Suppliers had increased\ntheir prices so we increased ours; portion control was\nsaid to be lacking so we tightened it up; takings were\nsuffering at the hand of a better range provided by\ncollege outlets so we looked at what else we could\nprovide. These were the sort of decisions which we\nwere in the position to make and were indeed making.\nThat there were delays in dealing with some other\nissues is cited as dithering on my part. For example,\nthe RCSU claim about poor service at their dinners took\nsome time to sort out. By the time it reached my hands\nthere were no more catering meetings scheduled for\nthe Autumn Term which had one day left to run. I believed that as I had not been present at the dinners\nin question and that the catering staff felt that an\nadequate service had been provided, the matter should\nbe taken to a catering committee, and indeed the ICU\nPresident asked me to make it an agenda item as he\nwished to discuss the whole future of dinners in the\nUnion. By the time the catering manager had returned\nfrom compassionate leave, the finance officer had\nidentified a possible theft of stock or cash from the\nsnack bar. When it became clear that this was to\nbecome a police matter I was advised that the details\nof the trading account should not be made public by\nthe senior treasurer and by the police through the\nPresident. As the catering committee members would\nundoubtedly be demanding details of the account I "

This will\nultimately make recruitment much harder in the long term.\nSOCIETIES:\nOne of the posit ve aspects of the increase in overseas student numbers\nhas been the formation of several new societies, in addition to the 17\nalready in existance. This year has so far seen the formation of a Korean\nSociety, and two others, the Japanese society ,and the Middle East\nsociety will be active by next session. The activities of the societies in\ngeneral has been about normal, though several societies have shown a marked increase in activity.\nos c The OSC executive has generally performed much better than in any\nprevious year ( out of the last five). I hope this shows how by spreading\nthe workload a lot can be achieved in a short time, this bodes well for\nthe future.\nEVENTS\n1. Sports\nThis year the appointment of an OSC Sports Officer has been extremely\neffective. He has been able to coordinate the weekly activities of the\nvarious societies, within the very limited time all oct ed for the use of\nfacilities,as well as organise the International Week sports tournaments.\nThis year the traditional 6-a side football tournament,with teams playing\nfor the Jose Molina (International) Cup, again saw the Cypriot society\nteam victorious, for the second year running. An International week\nbasketball tournament was also initiated this year with Greek, Cypriot, IC\nBasketball and OSC All Star teams taking part. Congradulations to the\nOSC All Star team who performed to a very high standard and won the\ntournament convincingly.\n2. International Night.\nThe highlight of the OSC calendar was the International Night in\nFebruary. This has grown into a major event in recent years, attracting\nabout 1500 people this year, and has gained a reputation as being one of\nthe best International events amongst the London Colleges. It is far\nremoved from any other event at Imperial and draws in many students,\nacademics and families for an evening of varied entertainment. This year\nsaw the traditional national exhibitions, Latin American carnival and AfroCaribbean Disco. The highlight of the evening however was un doubt ably the Cultural Show which had nine acts from the Cypriot,Indian,Korean,Sri\nLankan and Turkish societies taking part, all of whom performed\nextremely well.\nIn conclusion I would say that this year has been particularly successful\nfor the OSC and its' constituent societies on many fronts. I believe there\nhas been a greater awareness of the International community at Imperial\ngiving one the opportunity to find out about the various cultures present\nat IC as well as giving overseas students the chance to bring to the\nattention of all students at Imperial matters of international significance.\nThe spirit of Internationalism which exists at IC and over ides all else\nwithin the OSC bodes well for the future.\nDavid R. Munasinghe.\nOSC Chairman 1987-1988\nPublications Board Chair\nChristopher Martin\nImperial College is fortunate to possess some of the best and widest\nranging media of any University, and Publications Board is the body that\nlooks after the administrative and financial side of these publications on\nbehalf of the Union.\nIt is important to stress that, in normal circumstances, the Publications\nBoard has no editorial control over its publications. I am pleased to say\nthat during the last two years during which I have been Chair, the Board\nhas not encountered a situation where it was forced to interfere\neditorially.\nHowever, a great deal of time has been spent by the Officers of the\nBoard in defending publications from attacks from within the Union itself,\nattacks on the principle of editorial freedom on which our publications are\nbased. Because we have such a wide range of experienced and well\nresourced media at the College, the approach to these publications must\nbe necessarily different from a students' union that just puts out a news\nsheet every week.\nWe cannot allow any one member of the students' union dictate what\nappears and does not appear in our publications, unless that is the task to\nwhich they have been elected, and then that editor is responsible to the\nbody that elects them.\nWe had a situation with the Union Handbook over the summer where\nunacceptable changes were forced through in the final drafts, against the\nwishes of the editor, in order to present a less accurate and more\nfavourable view of IC and IC Union. If any of the publications we produce\nare to have any credibility at all, and are not just to be puppets of the\nUnion administration, then this behaviour cannot be allowed.\nI am pleased to report that, eventually, a policy was passed ensuring that\nthe Handbook editor does have the final say of what goes in the\nHandbook so this situation should not happen again.\nThis year has been an example of a very useful function of Publications\nBoard: to act as a buffer between the Union and the publications, and to\nstop the Union's financial power becoming editorial power.\nI must say that the Union Finance Committee this year has been\ncompletely schizophrenic-one meeting it seems to be the most\nenlightened it has ever been since I started going over 4 years ago\u2014and\nthe next it is a shambles. Particularly, the Five Year Plan meeting showed\na great lacking in any consistent financial policy at all. The policy\nchanged three times in the space of an hour! Sensible, concrete and\nbinding financial policy must be a first priority for the UFC next year.\nUFC did pass policy on the membership subscriptions on the two\npublications that do need to charge membership; IC Radio and STOIC.\nPrevious years have seen the membership fee rise to a level where\nstudents were put off joining; in particular IC Radio was finding great\ndifficulty in providing the kind of service they would like and that the\nstudents deserve. The new policy allows the individual publication to set\nits own membership fee at a level that will encourage, instead of\ndiscourage, new members and will allow a better and larger service.\nSt Marys\nOne change next year that perhaps will affect the Publications more,than\nmost is the merger with St Marys. It will require money from some\"\nsource, to provide Mary's with an Alternative Prospectus, Handbook, and\ncopies of FELIX and the Phoenix, the least they can expect as part of\nImperial College Union. They might want to produce their own Handbook\nand AP; this is up to them. It would be en our mou sly unfair, however, for\nstudents in one part of ICU to have these facilities, and in another hot to.\nThere seems to be a very strong case to be made to College to provide\nthese resources.\nLooking to the future may also see IC Radio and STOIC provided with\nfeeds to St Mary's, particularly their Hall of Residence.\nThe Handbook\nThis was produced over the Summer by Pippa Salmon, and was certainly\nup to the excellent standard we have come to expect. I have yet to see\nan equal to this publication produced by any other college.\nFelix\nUnder the editorship of Judith Hackney, most of the problems this year\nhave been with the Print Unit. Problems with the reliability of the\nequipment kept recurring, and resulted in many all night sessions.\nHowever, FELIX did appear every Friday on time to an excellent standard\nand has been well received and well read.\nMany detailed discussions were held over the future of the Print Unit,\nafter it became clear that the Litho Operator was working well over his\ncontracted hours every week. Steps have been taken to cut down his\nwork load, but the situation will have to be carefully monitored in the\nfuture so the balance between Union work at cost price, and outside\nwork at a profit, is never tipped too far.\nIC Radio\nUnder Steve Gutteridge this year, IC Radio seems to have been adversely\naffected by the substantial membership fee, and this has certainly\nresulted in a poorer service than could otherwise be expected. They are\ncertainly looking to the future, however, and have recently obtained a licence so they can try out the possibility of broadcasting to the Princes\nGardens halls on the FM band, with a large increase in quality. Again, the\nspectre of Community Radio looms, and it is reassuring to see that they\nare well prepared.\nSTOIC\nSTOIC have expanded their programmes to include broadcasting on Friday\nevenings, now that they have their own studio in the Union Building.\nHowever, I must express concern about the manner and amount of\nmoney which has been spent on this project over the past few years. It\nappears that every few months they find they need a new piece of\nequipment in order for them to broadcast...and we are assured that this\nis the last item they will need to finish their studio. I have heard this said\nof no less than five separate claims over the last three years.\nSome Officers within STOIC seem to think the Union has undertaken to\nequip them to whatever standard they like, and all that they have to do is\nclaim of the nearest available contingency fund. I have great doubts, after\n3 years of seeing the Studio develop, of whether unqualified students\nhave enough knowledge to make judgments on the suitability of what is\nvery expensive equipment, and I propose that before any more money is\nspent on the expansion of the Studio, outside expert advice should be\nsought.\nPhoenix\nA new style of Phoenix has appeared this year. Instead of the previous\npractice of producing one a year and then attempting to sell it, this year\n6 Annual Report '88 FELIX\n\n"

The Saturday of the FA Cup\nFinal is upon us once again where two\nteams and their respective faithful\ngather by the shadows of those\nfamous twin towers to battle out the\n'Final Tie' of the greatest and oldest\nfootball competition in the world.\nThis year it is the turn of Liverpool\nand Wimbledon to step out onto the\nWembley turf and sav our the\natmosphere of a lifetime.\nLiverpool\nSo much has been said, seen and\nwritten about Liverpool this season\nthat a few paragraphs can't really do\nthem justice. They are already league\nchampions and Wimbledon alone\nprevent them from completing their\nsecond double in three years. In goal\nis the extrovert Bruce Grobbelaar,\nsometimes brilliant, sometimes\nreckless. The defence will be chosen\nfrom such blockers as Scottish\ninternational Alan Hansen, Gary\nGillespie, Nigel Spackman from\nChelsea and a man who has come\nthrough the ranks (shock, horror,\nsurprise) Gary Ablett. The midfield\nand attack is where Liverpool really\nshow their class. Ray Houghton, a \u00a3700,000 buy from Oxford and a once free transfer from West Ham,\nlooks confident. Big scoring\nsharpshooter and penalty man John\nAldridge has filled the gap left by\nRush. England man Peter Beardsley\nhas been a revelation, who will forget\nthat goal against Everton? New\nmaster Steve McMahon, a midfield\ngenius with a new lease of life.\nFootballer of the year John Barnes is\npure class. He had been living on his\ngoal against Brazil for years but is\nnow an England certainty. Craig\nJohnston, the curly Aussie and Jan\nMolby the s couse Dane are also in\ncontention. With players like Barry\nVenison and Ronnie Whelan as back-ups, the squad looks very strong.\nThe man in charge is Kenny 'sorry,\ncan you repeat that please?' Dalglish.\nHe is down as a player-manager but\nis now content to sit on the bench\nwhile his men do the business on the\nfield. They haven't had an easy\npassage to Wembley with victories\nover Stoke (after an away scoreless\ndraw), Everton, Aston Villa (away),\nManchester City (away) and a tough\ntussle with Nottingham Forest at\nHillsborough. The main man to watch\nis Barnes. If he con jur s up his magic,\nthey could be unstoppable.\nWimbledon\nTwelve years is a long time in football\nand a progression from non-league to\nDivision One and now Wembley is\nquite staggering. It is their first FA\nCup Final and nerves will be jangling.\nIn goal is the captain and all four\ndivisions man Dave Beasant, a highly\npaid player who leads from the back.\nIn defence they have ex-Argyle man\nClive Goodyear, little Terry Phelan\nand ex-Brighton player Eric Young\nwho recently reduced Pompey\ngoalkeeper Alan Knight's face to a disaster area. There is also the Psycho\nVinny Jones, the man-to-man marker\nwho Paul Gascoigne of Newcastle got\nvery intimate with. Under 21 star\nAndy Thorn completes the rear guard. The midfield and attack mixes flair\nwith true grit. Alan Cork has been\nthere since the beginning of time.\nTerry Gibson, the ex-Coventry and\nMan Utd man, plays his part after a record \u00a3 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 transfer. There is\nLawrie Sanchez from Reading and the\nclass little 5'6\" Denis Wise, the man\nwith little hair and a big heart. The\nhit man (no pun intended) is John\nFashanu, the \u00a3 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 ex-Millwall\nfront man and amateur boxer. The\nback-up men include Brian Gayle,\nCarlton Fairweather (let's hope it is)\nand ex-England, Real Madrid and\nWBA star Lawrie Cunningham.\nThe men in charge are Bobby\nGould, the much travelled player\nturned manager, and his sidekick Don\nHowe, with a club who appreciates\nhim now. Their route to the final has\nbeen a mixed bag. Victories over\nWBA (a later goal burst), Mansfield\n(away), Newcastle (away), Watford\n(after being down at half time) and\nLuton at White Hart Lane after also\nbeing 1-0 down. (Denis Wise netting\nthe winner.) The main men to watch\nare Wise and Fashanu, if they sparkle\nthe Wombles could pull it off.\nOn paper it looks a very good final\nwith the perfect match of Champions\nand underdogs. The second string\nlove Wembley, who can forget\nSunderland, Southampton, Ipswich,\nWest Ham or last year's wonder\nheroes Coventry? This may tip the\nbalance and as I predicted the Dons\nto win from Round Three and the fact\nthat they have the guts required, I am\ngoing for a Wimbledon victory after\nextra time or even a replay. Sit back\nin your armchairs this Saturday, open\na can of your favourite tipple and\nsav our the atmosphere. You can even\nthrow a toilet roll at the TV to feel\nthat you are really there! For overseas\nstudents, this is our big day so join\nin and sample the true English way\nof life.\nYours for the last time,\nAdrian AB Grainger.\nby\nAdrian\nBourne\nj^r^ OTOR\nIt's the middle of May on the French\nRiviera. Film stars, directors,\nproducers and Barry Normans are\nlooking for something to do on\nSunday afternoon in between\nwatching the latest offerings at the\nCannes Film Festival. Why not nip\ndown the coast a few miles to Prince\nRainier's place and watch some motor\nracing?\nThat is, in essence, the story behind\nthe Monaco Grand Prix, or is the\nracing the story behind the posing?\nMonte Carlo in May is one of the\nplaces to be seen on the European\nsocial circuit and as such attracts a different type of crowd from the\nnormal Grand Prix. The sponsors\nlove the place and bring guests galore,\nall hoping to see their cars succeed.\nThis puts extra pressure on teams and\ndrivers\u2014not as if they needed any\nmore, for this is the oldest surviving\nstreet course on the World\nChampionship calendar. The circuit\nwinds its way around the principality\nin a tortuous two mile ribbon, past the\nfamous Hotel de Paris, the Casino,\nthe Mirabeau Hotel, through the\ntunnel under Loews Hotel, around the\nharbour and the hairpin at La\nRascasse Restaurant.\nThere are two schools of thought\nabout the relative performances of the\nturbos and at mos on this very slow\n(85mph) circuit. One is that the\ngreater agility and lighter weight of\nthe at mos will give them the edge,\nwhereas some think that the low fuel\nconsumption on this circuit will free\nthe turbos to use more of their power.\nI 'll go for a compromise\u2014the best of\nthe at mos will be better than the\nturbos\u2014except the McLarens. The\nbig question is: can anyone end the\nMcLaren domination of this season so\nfar?\nAlain Prost leads the Championship\non fifteen points with team mate\nAyrton Senna next up on nine. Prost\nwon three consecutive Monaco GPs\nbut Senna won last year in the actively\nsuspended Lotus-Honda. It should be\na classic struggle\u2014two great drivers\nin clearly superior cars fighting\namongst themselves. Qualifying and\nthe start will be all important. If one\nof them gets through the Virage Ste\nDevote first with the other behind\nother cars then the race will be as\ngood as over. The most likely\nintel oper is Nigel Mansell, always\nheroically fast on the streets, but with\na question mark over the reliability\nof his Judd V8 engines. His Williams\nteam mate Riccardo Patrese (winner\nin '82) should also be well up, but I don't expect the Benettons to show as\nwell as they did at Imola. Rory\nByrne's chassis have never gone as\nwell on street courses as on road\ncourses and drivers Routsen and\nNannini have yet to show any\noutstanding street craft. Expect the\nMarches of Ivan Capelli and Mauricio\nEugelmin to be the other leading\nat mos. Head on the block time again: Prost\nto win, Patrese top at mo. After the\nBBC's debacle with the San Marino\nGPI am assured that the race will be\nshown live on Sunday Grandstand,\nstarting at 2.30pm. Over in the States, motorsport and\nthe month of May mean one thing\u2014\nthe Indianapolis 500. This Sunday\nsees the start of qualifying when pole\npositions will be decided. The race\nitself on May 29 will be watched by\n400,000 people making it the world's biggest sporting event. More details\nin two weeks time.\nby\nMartyn\nPeck\nFirstly, Shan sends his apologies.\nUnfortunately, he has been hit by the\nlove bug, leaving me to write his\ncolumn.\nSaturday saw Kalyasi win what was\nsupposed to be a Derby trial.\nHowever, the main contender,\nAlwuhush was withdrawn before the\noff. Apart from the Derby, the other\nclassic which looks exciting is the\nOaks. One of the nags fancied is\nDiminuendo. This left the field\nstanding at the two-furlong marker,\nand was slowing down as it passed the\npost.\nThis weekend, the Irish 2000\nGuineas sees a showdown between\ntwo of this classic's top horses;\nCaerwent, who was disappointing in\nthe English equivalent of this\nprestigious race; and Emmson who\nwill not be suited by the soft ground.\nHopefully, next week I can give\nyou my tip for the Derby.

The\nIrish connection is left very low key,\nalmost as subtle background to the\nevents which the film portrays.\nStarring as the IRA partisan Martin\nFallon is Mickey Rourke {Barfly,\nAngel Heart), cast brilliantly in the\npart which could have been written\nfor him. The film opens with Fallon\nin advert ant ly killing a bus load of\nschoolchildren\u2014the single violent act\nwhich convinces him to leave Ireland\nfor good.\nThat's where Alan Bates (The\nEntertainer) comes in. He plays\nLondon gangland boss Jack Meehan,\noperating a drugs and prostitution\nsyndicate using a funeral director's business as a cover. Meehan offers\npassage to America, a passport and\ncash, but only if Fallon will carry out\na hit on one of his rivals.\nFallon agrees reluctantly and wipes\nthe guy out while he is visiting his\nPrince of Darkness (18)\nGod exists, and it can be scientifically\nproved. This is the stunning\nrevelation presented to us in the new\nfilm by John Carpenter The Prince of\nDarkness. God exists in all things at\na subatomic level, and this results in\nthe strange concepts of Quantum\nPhysics. Also, just as there are\nparticles and anti-particles, there's a God and an anti-God.\nA priest (Donald Pleasance)\nsummons a group of graduate students\nand scientists to an abandoned church\nto probe the secrets of a mysterious\ncann is ter. With the cann is ter they find\nan alternative bible (like an alternative\nprospectus) which tells things as they\nreally were. Apparently the bible we\nall know, was just something for those\nsimple people who didn't know what\ncalculus was. But now 2000 years\nlater we know about Quantum\nMechanics and so the real truths can\nbe explained to us.\nmother's grave. The murder is\nwitnessed by Father DaCosta, an ex-SAS officer turned priest, played by\nBob Hoskins (Mona Lisa, The Long\nGood Friday). From then on the story\nplods along at a steady pace,\ndeveloping into quite a thrilling\nclimax.\nThe film is based on a book by Jack\nHiggins (The Eagle Has Landed,\nExocet) and the author claims a hidden narrative in all his books\u2014\nthe eternal questions about the nature\nof man. This theme is clearly evident\nin A Prayer for the Dying as the\nemptiness which appears when\nyou've reched your peak. Mickey\nRourke shows this in his character,\nrevealing himself layer by layer in a display of fine acting. He explains his\nthoughts to Bob Hoskins from the\npulpit in a short exchange which is\nThe manuscript explains that Satan,\nthe Prince of Darkness, is entombed\nwithin the cann is ter, and it sets out\nto prove scientifically with a series of\ndifferential equations that what Jesus\nsaid 2000 year ago was true. This is\na bit much for the students to take in,\nbut they also have to contend with\nbeing individually killed off or\nzombi fie d because it just so happens\nthat Satan, after seven million years\nconfinement, decides that this is the\ntime to escape and so effect the\ncoming of his father, the anti-God.\nPrince of Darkness marks another\nventure into horror films for John\nCarpenter (Halloween, Christine),\nand here he takes his science very\nseriously. But in the end the use of\nthe strangeness of Quantum Reality\nas a basis for supernatural behaviour\nserves as just a vehicle for a rather\nroutine horror film. There are some\nnice spine-tingling touches, but the\ndelivered with a sad finality. 'There's nothing worth killing for, and there's nothing worth dying for, but the real\ntruth is there's nothing worth living\nfor either.' The confusion in.** le the\ncharacter is much like that of Harry\nAngel in Angel Heart.\nBob Hoskins is not my first choice\nfor a priest (typecasting perhaps?) and\ninevitably his performance is not\nequal to his part in Mona Lisa but he\ndoes well playing a character very\nsimilar to Rourke's. Alan Bates is\nquietly menacing as Meehan.\nYounger brother Billy Meehan,\nsadistically and psychotic ally portrayed by Christopher Fulford,\nprovides a character who you'll love\nto hate, and enjoy the sickening way\nRourke deals with him.\nThe other characters, father\nDaCosta's blind niece Anna, and two\nIRA members sent to catch or kill\nFallon provide a little more depth to\nthe plot if not to their roles.\nA Prayer for the Dying is quite a sad yet enjoyable film, not being\nheavily political, and is worth seeing\nif only for Mickey Rourke. It opens\ntonight at the Leicester Square\nTheatre.\nacting is mostly dreadful and\nunconvincing (or is it that scientists\nreally do act that way?).\nUltimately it is in the silly physics\nand theology that the fun in the film\nlies as it happily explains away life,\nreligion and....everything, in one fell\nswoop.\nSumit Guha\nMUSIC\nAliens Ate My Buick\nThomas Dolby\nAliens Ate My Buick is the sort of\nthing that could easily achieve cult\nstatus if enough people get to hear of\nit. It is, in fact, the latest album from\nThomas Dolby, and is definitely the\nsort of album that reaches out and\ngrabs you. The cover is a mixture of\nsixties style film hoarding, MontyPhython style cartoons, and Flash\nGordon style melodrama. One of the\nunchanging features of rock groups\nis how seriously most of them take\nthemselves and their music. This\ncriticism certainly stops short of\nThomas Dolby, whose latest album is\na series of musical send-ups, with\nhilarious lyrics, and a wide variety of\nmusical styles. The Key to Her\nFerrari sounds like big-band jazz,\nsending up people who fall in love\nwith their car, whilst Airhead and Hot\nSauce have a viciously funky bass,\nand are about women who just refuse\nto be liberated. Ever heard a road-drill\non a record before? Rounding up with\nthe a e the rial Budapest by Blimp, here\nis an album which displays more\nimagination than anything I 've ever\nbought before.\nRichard Fincher\nFELIX Friday 13th May 1988 7\n\n"
