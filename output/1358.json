    "content": "2 felix Thursday 5 October 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTone deafness\n\u201cWhistling a merry tune whilst\nwalking gaily down the street on\na crisp autumn morning, do you\nfind that that the reaction is often\nchildren running screaming in the\nopposite direction rather than an\nappreciative smile from a fellow\npedestrian? Congenital amusia is\na disorder that results in sufferers\nbeing unable to either perceive or\nproduce music.\u201d\nPAGE 5\nChinese whispers\n\u201cRather than starting the year\nand having Felix talk about\nthe activities and indeed the\nwhereabouts of students during\nfresher\u2019s week, this year has\nstarted with very interesting news\nin the form of Emily Chow and the\nChinese society.\u201d\nPAGE 7\nfelix 1,358\nThursday 05.10.06\nBad vs good\n\u201cIn this music section we like to be\ncontroversial so we gave a good\nreview to a new Warp electronic\nalbum and a bad review to The\nYoung Knives album. It would\nbe good to get feedback from\nother people who have heard\nthese albums so that we can get a\ndiscussion going.\u201d\nPAGE 11\nIn a rather furious statement to\nFelix, John Kenchington, the London Student editor, said: \u201cROAR\nshould be seen as a shining example of what not to do to student\njournalism. We want to make sure\nthat London Student does not go\nthe same way as ROAR; our editorial independence should be seen\nas paramount.\u201d Commenting on\nthe somewhat odd behaviour of\nthe removal of clauses from the\npresentation by Vicki Slater, Mr.\nKenchington said: \u201cIt is nothing\nshort of scandalous that Slater told\nus she didn\u2019t know why she made\nthe changes\u201d, adding that this removal from a document tailored by\nMs. Slater for ULU management\n\u201cdoes not bode well\u201d.\nFelix also caught up with Chief\nSubeditor of London Student, Jeremy Harris, at Freshers\u2019 Fair. Mr.\nHarris said that financial independence seemed to no longer be\non the table with regards to London Student\u2019s future, and was very\npessimistic at the chance of it not\nbeing closed in December, when\nULU Council will meet to discuss\nthe proposals: \u201cthey want to close\nus down!\u201d Speaking about the possible independent role of the news-paper, he commented \u201cyou just try\nrunning a student newspaper without collegiate support\u201d.\nHe also discussed the possible\nremoval of the paid sabbatical editor position, saying that it would\nbe \u201cdisaster for the newspaper\u201d,\nand adding that he and three other\nmembers of the unpaid volunteer\nstaff had spent the entire summer\nvacation getting London Student\nready for publication, expressing\nregret that Felix and London Student are the only two London student newspapers with independent\nsabbatical editors. Mr. Kenchington\u2019s statement to Felix also commented on the possible removal of\nthe sabbatical position, saying that\nit would \u201cparalyse the newspaper,\nwhich needs twenty-four hour\nmanagement\u201d.\nULU\u2019s serious financial problems are now widely known, as\nreported in London Student and\nChinese Soc goes on\nAfter last week\u2019s cover story on the\nsuspension of Chinese Soc there\nhave been a mixed bag of updates\non the matter. The society have had\ntheir accounts frozen because they\nsold multi-year membership which\nis illegal, and as yet, the missing\nmoney from the memberships has\nnot been recovered. The accounts\nof the society are still suspended,\nthis means they cannot trade or organise any events that will require\nmoney being transferred to or from\ntheir account. We reported that they\nwould not have a stall at Freshers\u2019\nFair. This was overturned by the\nUnion and they had a stall, though\nit was however closely monitored in\ncase they sold membership. The society\u2019s stall was also monitored for\nthe selling of membership via wireless internet connections, as were\nother stalls at the Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nEmily Chow did not contact Felix directly but got her solicitors,\nRochman Landau, to send a short\nemail to say that they she was not\nprepared to make a comment. This\nemail was not read until after Felix\nwas sent an e-mail on September\n29 from the same solicitors to confirm that the Chinese Society would\nhave a stall at the Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nThis was a day after the last issue\u2019s\nprint date. The reason for the first\nemail not being read is because it\nwas seen as junk mail, as it had a\nfile attachment that appeared to be\nsimilar to a virus attachment.\nThe matter of the money for mul-ti-membership being missing has\nnot yet been resolved. At the time\nFelix went to press, the solicitors\nfor Emily Chow have not met with\nthe Deputy Presidents for Clubs &\nSocieties and Finance & Services\nto discuss any action to be taken.\nThe society\u2019s accounts are likely to\nremain suspended until the matter\nis resolved.\nIt appears, from the solicitors\u2019 let-ters, that Miss Chow has entirely\ndropped any threat of legal action\nagainst the Union or the individual\nsabbaticals involved in the disciplinary proceedings against ICCS.\nThe letters refer to reaching an\namicable agreement with the Union. Felix hopes this farcical situation will be resolved soon.\nMatty Hoban\nThreat to London\u2019s free\nstudent press by unions\nContinued from page 1 other newspapers. At the moment,\nthe newspaper receives almost\n\u00a330,000 from ULU, which is just 3%\nof the Union\u2019s \u00a31m available grant.\nMr. Kenchington questioned the\nlogic of the cutting of this expense,\nsaying: \u201cIt is astonishing that that\nit [the cost] is being targeted so\nstrongly\u201d.\nFelix costs the Union about\n\u00a37,000, not including the sabbatical\neditor\u2019s salary, which brings the\ncost up to around \u00a328,000. However, it made nearly \u00a350,000 last year\nin advertising, with print costs being around this amount. Because\nof the highly targeted nature of the\nnewspaper\u2019s readership, Felix is\nable to charge substantial sums for\nadvertising to corporate entities.\nLondon Student, with a far larger\ndistribution and readership, is\nlikely to be able to command even\ngreater fees than this.\nIn comparison with ROAR, the\nUnion has received far more complaints from the College authorities about Felix in the previous\nyear, though no threats have been\nmade by the Sabbs to close the paper down, or neuter it in a similar\nway to the KCLSU newspaper.\nThe idea of having a \u201cMedia &\nCommunications\u201d Deputy President, responsible for Felix\u2019s overall content, but not its day-to-day\nproduction, has been mooted numerous times, and was allegedly\ndiscussed in the sabbatical team\nlast year. This setup operates in a\nnumber of other universities; most\nnotably at LSE\u2019s Beaver. However,\nin place of a dedicated sabbatical editor, there is a large team of\neditors, graphics assistants, and\ndesigners. The freedom that such\nsystems allow varies from year\nto year according the personality\nof the overseeing sabbatical and\ntheir closeness to the President\nand other officers. Felix, on the\nother hand, has its independence\nguaranteed by the Union constitu-tion, making the editor responsible\nonly to Union Council for the content of the newspaper.\nIt remains to be seen what this\nyear\u2019s sabbatical team will make\nof Felix\u2019s slightly odd status in the\nUnion\u2019s structure.\nNUS protest stunt at Fair\nA number of students took part in an NUS stunt at Freshers\u2019 Fair; the gagging is supposed to\nrepresent the fact that, with the Union leaving ULU, the students will have no voice unless they\ngain national representation through the NUS.

    "content": "ICURFC Canada Tour 2006\nThis July saw 25 of Imperial College\u2019s rugby club head to western\nCanada in search of fame, fortune,\nglory and perhaps a little liquor. The\ntour began in Edmonton. Stepping\noff the plane into blistering heat\nwe realised that things may not be\nquite as straight forward as we had\nhoped. However, rugby boys being\nrugby boys, little time was wasted\nin exploring the local taverns and\neateries, despite our first match being the following day.\nThe second evening presented us\nwith our first fifteen a side match, a\ngame that we were told was against\na team made up of a mixture of players from the local clubs. It just so\nhappened that this representative\nteam was the Edmonton Gold, a Canadian Super League team who finished second this year. The team in\nfront of us contained an awful lot of\ntalented looking players, including\nseveral internationals such as the\nCanadian try scoring record holder\nDave Lougheed and ex Leicester\nTigers winger Winston Stanley.\nHowever, we started with optimism\nand found ourselves only four tries\nto two down at the half, thanks to\nsome great play from the half back\npairing of Rob Robinson and Jim\nPedder. A lack of fitness and match\npractice as well as extreme conditions drain saw IC walking off after 80 minutes of fast paced rugby\nand a comprehensive drubbing at\nthe hands of Edmonton. The game\nended, 57-12. The score line does\nnot reflect how we had played in the\nmatch, and in fact there were hints\nof potential in the scratch squad\ncomprised of 1st, 2nd, 3rd and even\n4th team players.\nHaving enjoyed a few more days\nin Edmonton the journey south to\nCalgary was made for another fifteen a side match, the first sevens\ntournament and of course the legendary Calgary Stampede. It was\nbusiness as usual for the lads as we\nexplored Calgary, but we were a little more wary for our match against\nthe Calgary Irish after our lesson in\nEdmonton. The match looked like\nit may not have gone ahead, with a\nfierce thunder storm raging above\nour heads and interrupting play\nminutes in, but eventually it got un-derway. The Irish took advantage\nof the rain delay and immediately\npushed over for a try from a lineout.\nThis sparked IC into life and started a very tight match, dominated\nby forward play due to the stormy\nconditions. This limited IC\u2019s attack,\nbeing out muscled up front and unable to play the fast running rugby\nwe wanted. A solitary try came from\nQuincy Allen intercepting a miss\npass from the Irish 10 and running\nto the line. The score in the end was\n12-7, but we left feeling that it was\na match we could and should have\nwon.\nNext was the sevens tournament\nat the Stampede Sevens. The IC\nfirst squad qualified for the semi\nfinals having put out the previous\nyear\u2019s champions. This led to a\nmatch against a side from British\nColumbia, Meraloma. After a half of\npossibly the best sevens ever played\nby an IC side we led 25-0, however\na Meraloma fight back saw them\nscore three tries leaving the score\nat 25-19 with only a couple of minutes to play. But IC always looked in\ncontrol and victory seemed secure\nwhen Robinson crossed the line\nlate on, only for his try to be disallowed for time wasting after pressure on the referee from the Meraloma coach. This let Meraloma\nback in the game and a converted\ntry in the last play handed them\nvictory, much to the dismay of the\ntour party. Meraloma went on to\nmeet our old friends the Edmonton\nGold in the final where they were\ncomprehensively beaten. However\nrevenge would be had on Meraloma\nbefore the tour ended. A further\ncouple of days were had in Calgary\nenjoying the stampede and rodeo,\na highlight of the tour for many, as\nwell as a great final night in Cowboys. A special mention has to be\nsaid for Rob Gaskell and the luge at\nDaniel Lindsley\npage 19\nCROSSWORD\n& SUDOKU\nport\nS\nthe Olympic Park, something that\nonly Rob survived.\nThe next five days were rugby\nfree, spent in the glorious surroundings of the Rockies. One night was\nspent in the middle of nowhere at\nCanmore before moving on to Banff\nwhere the lads enjoyed white-water\nrafting, mountain biking, canoeing\nand the surroundings of the Lake\nLouise as well as the never ending\nhospitality of the Banff locals. After Banff we started the long journey to Vancouver with one night\u2019s\nstopover at Shuswap Lake, where\naccommodation was in the form of\nCabooses (railway carriages) and\na boat house. We enjoyed an open\ncampfire, local beer and a few of the\nguys sweated in a traditional Native\nAmerican sauna before an invigorating swim in the ice cold lake.\nThe last week of the tour was\nspent on the west coast at Vancouver and Victoria. Our final fifteen a\nside match was to be against Capilano, a top ranked British Columbia\nside. The game saw the best rugby\nplayed all tour, with the forwards\nfronting up against physically bigger and stronger opposition and\nthe backs running fantastic lines.\nThe game was close throughout\nbut first half scores from Quincy\nAllen and Rob Gaskell gave us the\nedge heading into half time before\nJim Pedder stretched the lead soon\nafter the break with a run from\nhalfway. Capilano scored two of\ntheir own before Raphael Diguisto\nput the game beyond doubt with\nanother try under the posts. The final score was 24-12, testament to a\nsquad that had developed throughout the tour to become a very good\noutfit. Choruses of Sylvia were sung\nwith gusto and new songs were\nlearnt thanks to the good lads from\nthe Capilano side. Be warned, those\nof a sensitive disposition may need\nto cover their ears next term as the\nrugby boys sing the S&M man.\nAfter another few days R&R at\nVictoria on Vancouver Island, where\nthe traditional Kangaroo Court was\nheld \u2013 much to the amusement of\nthe Canadian locals, it was time to\nhead back to Vancouver and the\ntwenty fifth Simon Fraser University Sevens tournament, where our\nold enemies Meraloma lay in wait.\nAgain the first squad looked in good\nform heading to a meeting with\nMeraloma. Rob Robinson looked\nto seek some personal revenge\nagainst the side that denied him at\nthe previous tournament scoring all\nfive of the tries in a 27 to 12 victory.\nThis time we reached the final, losing out in a close encounter to the\nBayside islanders, a team made up\nof Fijians that had won the tournament a total of 17 times.\nThat was the final night of a tour\nthat had been successful on and\noff the pitch. Western Canada had\nproven a tough rugby test for IC but\nit certainly was an enjoyable one.\nICU Rugby Football Club on tour in western Canada.\nwww.tevong.co.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Young Knives stab eardrums\nWhere other more reputable newspapers praise The Young Knives album, we slate it\nWarp electronic album actually good\nWarp is one of the world's best-known and most respected labels,\nand has consistently put out records\nover the last decade that have come\nto be looked on as genre standards;\nc.f. Aphex Twin, Autechre, Black\nDog. Whoever sits and listens to\ndemos at Warp has got to have\ngolden ears.\nIn the last couple of years, we've\nseen a diversification in Warp's\noutput. Gone are the faceless electronic stars of the early 90s, and in\ncome signings like Maximo Park.\nAt the same time, new electronic\nreleases have been faltering, with\nonly Jamie Lidell in recent years\nmanaged to bust through the ob-scureness barrier and get some\nmainstream press inches (he was\nin the Observer Music Monthly,\nf'god's sake). The underground\nstuff has left a lot to be desired,\nwith Black Dog's newie just rehashing early Black Dog (man, that stuff\nsounds dated) rather than attempting some kind of new shit.\nChris Clark isn't exactly unknown,\nand Warp devotees are sure to have\nhis back catalogue. I'll confess to being a relative virgin when it comes\nto Clark, so don't expect a lot of informed piffle about \"oh, he's moved\non, this is new, blah blah fucking\nblah.\" Here's the one-liner, so those\nimpatient internet-grabbers among\nyou can go ahead and queue it up in\nyour Bittorrent clients; this record\nis a fucking stormer.\nClark's motif is big, crackly synths,\nhuge hiphop breaks, and a dash of\nDSP crunch. The opener, Herr Bar,\nrides stuttering, chunky beats with\npretty xylophone patterns, with a\nmiddle eight whose burbling synths\nrecall Nathan Fake's My Bloody\nValentine impression. Just when\nyou're happily bobbing around on\nyour chair, Clark cracks open the\ntrack with swathes of white noise\nsurrounding the already dancefloor\nhumping beats.\nIn a similar vein is the superb\nVengeance Drools, which is crying\nout for an MC like Ghostface Killah, or maybe Aesop Rock, to come\nalong and throw some reasonably\nintelligent gangsta flow over the\ntop. Setting filmic strings atop a\nclunky vintage drum loop, Clark expertly conjures up bad boys cruising the city at night, top down.\nHe isn't all crotch-grabbing, posturing beats, though \u2013 a few tracks\neschew beats entirely, and come\nout sounding like Tim Hecker with\na taste for melancholic melodies.\nFrau Wav flirts with jazz breaks at\ntimes, but drifts almost arhythmica-ly around big (yet far from cheesy)\nviolins and broken, fuzzed out analog synths. Springtime Epigram\nfixates on a burbling sine wave\nand microshifts in the surrounding sounds to create its reflective,\nalmost morbid mood.\nI dropped in a facile comment\nabout cruising round a city at night,\nbutthere'sactuallyanundercurrent\nof city nightlife about this record -in the same way that dubstep has\ntaken the UK garage sound and\npushed it out into darker territory,\nincorporating dance and hiphop elements along the way, Clark's record\ndraws together a veritable shedload\nof genres and shoehorns them into\nhis own dark vision. The papable\nsense of tension about most of the\ntracks, and the sheer overwhelming darkness of the record, conjure\nup the essence of urban decay, of\na city lit up at night by neon glow.\nI'm reminded of the recent fuss surrounding the Burial record; this is\nactually a much better representation of late night London than the\noverhyped dubstep release.\nMy final words are reserved for\nthe last track on the album, the epic\n(in a good way) Autumnal Crash.\nHere Clark hits upon the per-Editorial\nRant\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nW\nelcome to the\nsecond music\nsection of the\nyear. I didn\u2019t get\nmany objections\nto the album list last week so I assumed that I am 100% correct. I for\none am not sure about this.\nAnyway, this week I wish to tell\nof the wonder of FREE CDs and\nFREE GIGS. I repeat, FREE CDs\nand FREE GIGS. If you would\nlike FREE CDs and FREE GIGS\nthen come along to our Music\nFelix meeting. This meeting will\ntake place today (Thursday 5th\nOctober) at 12noon in Da Vinci\u2019s\nor some part of the union. There\nis a picture above of me so that\nyou have a visual reference. I also\nhave said FREE CDs in my hands.\nIf you can\u2019t make it to the meeting\nand haven\u2019t tracked us down at the\nFreshers\u2019 Fair then e-mail us (look\nat the top of the page).\nAlso this week we have two album reviews. One of these albums\nis already out and available for\nyour consumption; the Clark album\nis brand spanking new. In this\nmusic section we like to be controversial so we gave a good review to\na new Warp electronic album and a\nbad review to The Young Knives al-bum. It would be good to get feedback from other people who have\nheard these albums so that we can\nget a discussion going. What we\nsay shouldn\u2019t be the be-all and end-all, so we want to know what you\nthink about these albums.\nWe are also helping to organise\nan event in the union. This will be\nnext Friday, which is October 13th.\nUnion Events are providing two\nacts who are called Ross Copperman and Rushmore.\nRoss Copperman has been\nreceiving some attention recently\nfrom the radio and is touring universities across the country. Along\nwith these two bands, we at the\nmusic section have selected a band\ncalled The Sailplanes. This band\nsound somewhere between Sonic\nYouth and Sleater Kinney. We like\nthe sound of them and hope you\nwill too. Watch this space for more\ninformation.\nAlso look out for Alternative Music Society nights on October 12th\nand 21st. On October 12th there\nare four acts with a beautiful, melodic edge and it will \u00a31 entry and\nfree for members of the society. Go\nlisten and enjoy!\nMaybe I should cheer up; it could\nbe worse. If I\u2019m given an album\nfeaturing a brightly dressed farmer\nstanding alongside a man made\nentirely of straw, I should be grateful that I\u2019m not reviewing \u201cGeneric\nIndie-Rock Group (Number 107)\u201d,\nwhose style consists entirely of tat\nfrom Camden Market in an entirely\nwitless and unoriginal attempt to\nbe edgy, with music to match.\nSo here we have the debut full al-The Young Knives\nVoices of Animals and Men\n(Transgressive)\nbum from Oxford-based The Young\nKnives, and past form initially revealed a band which is lively and\nfun. Unfortunately, for the main\npart, this album is anything but.\nWhen you press play, you\u2019re greeted with a drum crash which fills\nthe headphones. Good start. From\nthere it\u2019s all very much downhill.\nLike most bands of the moment,\nthe music consists solely of choppy\nguitars bereft of any rhythm, melody or originality in a crass attempt\nto copy the post-punk era. Lyrically,\nit\u2019s nothing exciting; in fact it\u2019s just\nplain lazy.\nLead singer Henry Dartnall just\nbarks out almost randomly-com-posed lines, consisting of three\nwords each with no poetic cohesion\nwhatsoever. When he can\u2019t be bothered it generally degrades to shouting the same thing over and over in\nan effort to fill airtime.\nThe early songs are full of faults;\nan attempt at humour in the opener\nPart Timer \u2013 where the music stops\nandthebanddiscusswhattodonext\nmid-song \u2013 falls flat, mainly due to\nthe weakness of the surrounding\nelements. A crack at evoking the\nspirit of Syd Barrett-esque whimsy\nsuffers from the general malaise in\nthe lyrics. Some interesting guitar\nwork pops out in Mystic Energy but\nthen mutates into sub-Sonic Youth\nnoise. Whilst taking this in, I cannot help but think that if you give\na three-year-old a Tommy Tutone\nand record what happens, it would\nbe more complex then this. Some\nof it is catchy; but then again so is\nsyphilis.\nHalfwaythrough,however,there\u2019s\na glimmer of hope. After the rocker\nHere Comes the Rumour Mill,\nthere\u2019s the delight that is Tailors.\nTaking the rather esoteric noise of\nscissors cutting as its basis, along\nwith a doleful acoustic guitar, this\nsimple track about haberdashery is\none of the rare moments where the\nwhimsy pulls off. Topped off with\nHenry Dartnall's delicate vocals,\nyou\u2019re left with something truly\nmystical. The surreal Half Timer\nleads into the genuinely funny She\u2019s\nAttracted To, showing that when\nthey put the effort in, The Young\nKnives can be a stand-out band.\nBesides, I defy anyone to not crack\nup at a song which starts \u201cWho are\nthese people? They are too stupid\nto be your real parents!\u201d\nAfter that it falls back to the same\nstate as before, albeit with some\nmelody and the surprising heartfelt Loughborough Suicide. I\u2019m not\ngoing to explain the album further;\ntrees have been killed to create this\nnewspaper and I\u2019m not letting their\npulp be used in vain.\nDespite some promising moments The Young Knives have\nshowed themselves to be another\nsub-standard band with few ideas.\nIf I hear another release like this\nsoon \u2013 which is likely \u2013 I\u2019ve a feeling my brain will melt. Or maybe I\nshould cheer up; it could be worse.\nMatthew Hartfield\n\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\nClark\nBody Riddle\n(Warp Records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nfect formula; emotive, overdriven\nRhodes chords, and a skittering,\nthundering breakbeat, building upwards and onwards with ever-thick-ening washes of static and faraway\ncity samples, gradually losing all\ncoherence and crashing into thick,\nHecker-like washes of reverb.\nI love this record. I love the oppressive aura. I love the dark, instrumental hiphop influence (yeah,\nlike Prefuse). I love the incredibly\ndetailed production that almost,\nalmost lets the tracks overflow the\nspeakers and set them crackling.\nMost of all, I love that the album\nflows almost perfectly \u2013 from the\nwake-up call of Herr Bar to the\ngentle fade-out of Autumnal Crash\n\u2013 this feels like a perfectly formed\npiece.

    "content": "A very early start on a miserable\nMonday morning in late June signalled the start of the Fellwanderers Summer Tour in the Swiss\nAlps. The Alpine Pass Route (APR)\nmakes a complete East to West\ntraverse of Switzerland, from Sargans to Montreux, and it was our\naim to tackle a significant chunk of\nthis epic journey.\nWe awoke in Meiringen to a glorious morning, and we were able to\ntruly appreciate our amazing sur-roundings. After a gentle \u2018introductory\u2019 day\u2019s walk we, spent the night\nin Grindelwald,, pitching our tents\nwith views of the Eiger. The entertainment for the night was provided\nby trying to light our cooking stoves\nusing ethanol instead of the recommended petrol, much to the amusement of eight hungry people.\nAfter a restless nights sleep due\nto heavy rain and thunderstorms,\nwe packed up and began our day\u2019s\nwalk. The walk was described as\n\u2018surprisingly steep\u2019, which we were\nsoon able to verify. Nonetheless,\nsuperb weather and scenic views\nmore than compensated for the\nphysical exertion needed on this\nsection. After more than 10 hours,\nhaving passed the Eiger/M\u00f6nch/\nJungfrau triple, we were relieved\nto pitch our tents and cook dinner,\nwith the stunning Staubbach waterfall illuminated in the background.\nUnfortunately, later on the following day the weather deteriorated\nand we had to change into our wet\nweather gear before continuing our\nascent to our rest point for the day,\nthe Rotstockh\u00fctte. The remote hut,\nat 2039m, is only accessible on foot.\nAfter a not insignificant pass following the Rotstockh\u00fctte, we tackled the highest (at 2778m) and the\nmost demanding of all passes on the\nAPR. Descending, steeply at times,\nabove glaciers we dropped to our\nnights rest, overlooking the amazing Oeschinensee. We were joined\nby some Swiss fishermen who had\ntravelled up to the Oeschinensee for\na weekend of fishing, and seemed\namazed to find us there. They could\nnot understand what we were doing there if we weren\u2019t fishing!\nThey made us feel most welcome,\noffering us their special homemade\n\u2018firewater,\u2019 which ensured a good\nnights sleep.\nAfter a rest day paddling in the\nlake, we climbed to the Bunderchrinde pass \u2013 a magnificent gap\nin a craggy ridge \u2013 and then down\nto Adelboden. The following day to\nLenk was \u2018relatively undemanding\u2019.\nAfter the usual procedure of pitching tents and cooking dinner, we\nvisited \u2018Andy\u2019s Pub\u2019 in Lenk, which\nwas exactly as the name indicates.\nWith a relatively early start, and\nthe absence of a reception, we left\nLenk unable to pay for our night\u2019s\nstay. We had already accomplished\nthe highest sections of our journey,\nbut nonetheless, today required the\ncrossing of two passes. Truttlisberg\npass at 2038m was our first, with our\nascent livened by climbing steel ladders beside a waterfall. After a brief\npause, we had to prepare ourselves\nfor our second pass of the day, the\nKrinnen pass at 1659m. Upon our\napproach to this wooded ridge, the\nweather deteriorated, and flickers\nof lightning and rumbles of thunder\nwere evident in our surroundings.\nWhen the rain caught up with us,\nit really made up for the glorious\nweather that we had received so\nfar. Very heavy thunderstorms accompanied our descent to Gsteig,\nwhere it was decided that in our\nsodden state, we should seek alternative accommodation. The one\nopen hotel in Gsteig, the very nice\nlooking Hotel Baren, took sympathy\non us, and Tim negotiated an effectively half-price deal. A superb meal\nin the adjacent restaurant didn\u2019t\ndisappoint, despite Evelyne nearly\nsetting the place on fire before we\u2019d\neven eaten.\nThe next day, after a promising\nstart, the weather again turned\nagainst us and we joined a herd of\ncows in a shed for our lunch. In the\nafternoon, we crossed the Col des\nAnderets, and after a welcome hot\nchocolate at Isenau, the brightening weather tempted us to carry\non a little further, to Col des Mosses. An amazing walk contouring\naround the mountainside provided\nspectacular views of mountain tops\npoking out above the clouds, with\nthe Mont Blanc massif visible in\nthe far distance. On arrival at our\nintended campsite, it became apparent that it was not aimed at people with tents. Too tired to carry on\nany further, we found a quiet area\nof the site and pitched our tent in\nsomebody\u2019s garden, ensuring that\nwe would have an early start in\nthe morning in case the owners\narrived.\nWe awoke with great determina-tion. Today we would tackle the last\nsignificant chunk of our trek. We\nhad great expectations of an amazing view of Lake Geneva, with Montreux remaining hidden behind a\nfinal spur of hillside. However, after\nseveral hours\u2019 walk we were presented with a blanket of haze and\nvery poor visibility. After spending\na few minutes cursing our luck, we\nwere rewarded with clearing views\nof Lake Geneva some 1200m below.\nOur destination that evening proved\nto be a perfect penultimate conclusion to our journey - we reflected\non our journey, as we wined and\ndined watching a delightful sunset\nsat 800m above the Lake, with the\ncity street lights glowing in the dis-tance, and the occasional sample of\nthe vibrant Montreux Jazz Festival\nclimbing to our ears.\nOur final base in Vevey acted\nmore as an expensive baggage\nstorage facility than a cheap hostel.\nWe celebrated the final night of our\ntour, enjoying drinks and dancing to\nthe live bands at the festival. After\ntwo weeks trekking across Switzerland, accomplishing over 10,000m of\nascent, and over 180km of mountain\ntrails we travelled back to England.\nWhilst hard work at times, we could\nall reflect on the magical scenery\nand the good times that we had all\nhad together.

    "content": "This is the winter of dress content\nMissing fashion shows, size 00 and the end of What Not To Wear\u2019s Trinny & Susannah\u2026 whatever next?\nAnother year, another set of rules\nto learn. I\u2019ve been getting rather\nbored of my wardrobe recently,\nsame old skinny jeans with flat\nshoes and variations on the theme\nof a tight top. So, this year\u2019s resolution is to wear outfits that cost no\nmore than \u00a350. When I mean outfit,\nI mean, shoes, underwear, top, bot-toms, bag, jewellery, the whole fucking lot. Should be interesting and\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to end up looking\nlike some kook from the local mar-ket, but at least mornings will be\nfilled with mental maths, (\u00a33.99 plus\n\u00a31.50 plus\u2026), instead of: \u201chmmm,\ncould this pink nail varnish possibly\ngo with my red shoes?\u201d\nI was recently given tickets to\nLondon Fashion Week, but being a\nsocial recluse, I decided that gallivanting in Yorkshire was much\nmore interesting. During a visit to\nWhitby Abbey I instantly felt the\nneed to don a nice black dress and\ngo hunting for Dracula, strange girl\nyou might think, but at least the catwalks agree that everyone\u2019s inner\ngoth should be celebrated; the Gothic Look is back! But for me the look\nshould really be called \u201crock\u2019n\u2019roll\ngroupie.\u201d Galliano\u2019s new collection\nlooked more like a homage to Axl\nRose (read Oral Sex). To perfect\nthe look, think sliver skulls, leather\nand bandanas. However, if like me\nyou\u2019re on a budget, Camden Market, famous for the weird and won-derful, will supply your every need\nfor the Gothic look.\nCharity shops have long been\none of my favourite haunts. I once\nfound a child\u2019s old school kilt for\n\u00a31.50. It belonged to Marianne\nHartley-Brown, and every time I\nwear it I wonder what she\u2019s up to,\nand whether she\u2019d approve of her\nkilt going to indie club nights and\ngetting drenched in beer. I haven\u2019t\nworn it for a while, due to the fact\nDolly Delaney that wearing a 7 year-olds kilt restricts ones breathing somewhat\n(I\u2019m a singer, didn\u2019t you know, and\nI breathe from the diaphragm). But\nthe recent rise of tartan and plaid\nhas made me re-think. If, like me\nyou have the same idea, be warned.\nOverdosing on the Scottish rag\ncould make you look like a Bay City\nRollers fan (a bad, bad thing). Keep\nit simple, ie only wear kilts.\nBy far the best look of this season is the Tailored look. Many of\nthe catwalks have tried to keep it\nsimple, with tailored dresses and\nleather gloves. But I say the more\nandrogynous your look the better.\nEven though it pains me to say it,\nKate Moss works androgyny better\nthan anyone I know: grey waistcoat\navec matching suit trousers and a\ncrisp white shirt. But, if you aim on\nbecoming a Moss-follower, make\nsure that the trousers fit your arse.\nMany a time I\u2019ve seen women with\nsaggy, unfitted bums and it looks\nawful.\nThis is a particularly sore point\nfor me. I am one of those Size 00\u2019s\nand believe me, it\u2019s crap. No I\u2019m not\nanorexic; I just have crappy genes\n(or should I say jeans?). At 5\u201d1, I\nwas always the smallest at school. I\ngave up ballet classes, so I could be\nwith the rest of my year on Thursday evenings; playing netball. The\nworst decision of my life, as no one\npassed the ball (well they couldn\u2019t\nsee me) and my graceful walk started to deteriorate. But then this year,\na revolution happened. Size 00 jeans\nappeared in Gap (albeit, in Japan)\nand I quickly shelled out \u00a345 to get\nthem. So long saggy bum, hello tight\narse! Larger people often complain\nabout Size 00\u2019s, but quite frankly\nthey have a much better fashion life\nthan us. They get way more material for their money\u2019s worth and never have to worry about their arses\nfilling trousers. They have wonderfully voluptuous breasts and are a\ndamn sight more intimidating that\nmyself when it comes to shouting at\nthe editor, because he won\u2019t make\nyou tea. So you see, Size 00\u2019s are the\nreal victims here.\nIf you are reading this and are utterly incensed at my words because\nyou\u2019re a larger woman and find it\nhard to dress yourself; then never\nfear. What not to wear (WNTW) is\nback. However, singer Mica Paris\nand \u201csupermodel\u201d Lisa Butcher\nhave replaced the duo of Trinny and\nSusannah. Last weeks\u2019 episode of\nWNTW had the same format as the\nlast episodes T&S presented, but\nI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all it shared with\nthe former shows. The clothes were\nmediocre and the advice was neither helpful, nor intelligent (flared\ntrousers make you look taller?!).\nT&S have now moved over to the\ndark side, ITV, and are presenting\ntheir own new show. How could\nthey sell themselves so cheaply?\nI am outraged and only hope that\nthey return to their rightful home\nsoon.\nYou may remember my first article of the 2005/6 year. I talked about\nthe new trends of that autumn and\nalso about a dress. \u201cThe Galaxy\u201d.\nThe dress of 2005. Many people\nhave called me the \u201cMystic Meg\u201d\nof the fashion world; some have\njust called me lucky. Whatever your\nstance, here are my top 5 predictions for this autumn:\n1) Gaucho Bag, by John Galliano\nfor Dior. As seen on Mischa Barton\nand currently being advertised by a\nmake-up less Kate Moss. It\u2019s a steal\nat \u00a3915 (as in most girls will have to\nsteal it).\n2) French Connection\u2019s Serpent\nDress; a bronze-sequined striped\nnumber. Every girl\u2019s been talking\nabout it, but at \u00a3130 it\u2019s time to start\ngetting yourself a rich and generous boy.\n3) The Little Black Dress. It\u2019s\nback, it\u2019s black and it\u2019s strapless.\nPrada have the perfect one for\n\u00a31,160.\n4) Gold is lighting up the catwalks\nthis season, for the ultimate ghetto\nchic, get down to Asda and buy a\ngold dress for \u00a314 from George!\n5) Chunky knits are warming\nup every the hardest of fashion\u2019s\nhearts. Stand out from the grey\ncrowd with Joseph\u2019s Blue jumper,\n\u00a3209.\nSTUDENT SHOP AT TOPSHOP OXFORD CIRCUS!\nFashion favourite Topshop is holding two shopping evenings for students at its\nOxford Circus store on Tuesday 10th and Wednesday 11th October.\nStudents are invited to enjoy 20% discount, quickie style advisor appointments\nand a free gift with every purchase over \u00a315. The evening events run from\n6pm \u2013 10pm and valid student ID will be required for discount.\nChristian Dior, Gaucho Bag, \u00a3915\nAlexander McQueen,\nAssymetrical Tartan Kilt \u00a3995\nAnna Sui, Strapless Cocktail\nDress \u00a3285\nFrench Connection, Serpent\nDress \u00a3130\nGalliano\u2019s\nnew collection\nlooked more\nlike a homage\nto Axl Rose\u2026\nTo perfect the\nlook, think sliver\nskulls, leather\nand bandanas.\n15\nfelix\nThursday 5 October 2006\nFASHION fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

There may\nbe a lucious and free-flowing mane\ncovering the troubled individual,\nbut delve a bit deeper and I bet\nyou\u2019ll find a Y somewhere in their\nchromosomes. It is statistical likli-hood that the baryon-informed being standing in front of you is not a\nwoman. It\u2019s not sexist; it\u2019s an un-disputable fact. So, why do so few of\nthe fairer sex grace the corridors of\nBlackett? Is the lack of ladies something we should worry about?\nVariety is the spice of life and if we\nare to believe the proverbial nursery rhyme (\u2018What are little girls\nmade of?\u2019) then physics is missing\nout on a lot of spice. In order to prevent extinction of this endangered\nspecies, a government initiative\nlabelled \u2018A Strategy for Women in\nScience, Engineering and Technology\u2019 was launched in April 2003 to\ntry to coax women into science. A\nmonth later the Institute of Physics jumped on the bandwagon and\nlaunched their own \u2018Women in\nPhysics\u2019 group whose efforts includes a \u2018how to attract women\u2019\nguide for physics departments.\nThe Institute\u2019s repertoire of hot\ntips includes advice to mechanics\nlecturers like: \u2018Make sure that examples given reflect modern society and are gender neutral. e.g. a bicycle is neutral, a car \u2013 particularly\na racing car- is more male.,\u2019 and\neven lecture theatres themselves\nmust take note, \u2018Do you have photographs of physicists on the walls?\n\u2013 if so what fraction are women?\u2019\nPolitical correctness gone mad?\nCertifiable, by the sounds of things.\nWhy men are lured by the seductive call of calculus and the major-Emma Turner ity of fashion students are female\nhas long been the subject of debate,\nand some suggest the root of it lies\nin our childhoods. When selecting\ntoys scientists have observed that\nlittle boys will gravitate towards\na ball or toy trucks whereas little\ngirls will tend to pick a doll. But is\nthe reason nature or nurture? Studies have shown that in general men\ndo slightly better in mathematical\nproblem solving and spatial reasoning than women suggesting an\nin-built mental difference between\nthe sexes. This is not to say that\nwomen cannot learn these skills\nto the same ability, but it may take\nthem longer. Although there is increasing evidence that this is due to\ncognitive differences in the brain,\nthe jury is still out. But there is no\nescaping the evidence that there is\na deficit of totty in the physics de-partment. Physics requires those\n\u2018male-favoured\u2019 skills that the majority of women shy away from thus\nfemale physicists are few are far\nbetween.\nSo how would you ever recognise\nsuch an elusive creature if by some\nmiracle you were to stumble across\none? She is often to be found in the\nlibrary or computer room, beavering away on her projects and problem sheets. A female physicist is\nalways working hard. She is more\nlikely to be surrounded by a gaggle\nof men than to gather with her own\nkind. For some unknown reason, female physicists spread out over the\nmale student body evenly like a thin\nlayer of oil on water. Finally some\nstudies over extensive periods of\ntime have shown that in some specimens traditionally female traits\nbecome reduced over years of male\nexposure and in extreme cases are\nlost altogether.\nAccording to Bob Forsyth, Senior\nWhistling a merry tune whilst walking gaily down the street on a crisp\nautumn morning, do you find that\nthat the reaction is often children\nrunning screaming in the opposite\ndirection rather than an appreciative smile from a fellow pedestrian?\nIf so, Krista Hyde and colleagues\nat the Montreal Cognitive Neurological Institute may hold the key\nto this most distressing condition.\nYou, like some 4% of the population,\nmay suffer from congenital amusia,\nor what our friends at the Royal\nCollege of Science refer to as \u2018tone\ndeafness.\u2019\nCongenital amusia is a disorder\nthat results in sufferers being unable to either perceive or produce\nmusic. These symptoms often manifest themselves despite apparent\nnormal neurological history, edu-cation, intelligence and memory. It\nis a lifelong musical affliction. Behavioural studies have previously\nassociated amusia with a severe\ndeficit in pitch processing but until\nrecently there was no neurological evidence to support this theory.\nHyde\u2019s study is the first such investigation into neural correlates\nof congenital amusia and appears\nto have discovered the area of the\nbrain responsible for the disorder.\nThe investigation consisted of two\ntests based firstly on the ability of\npatients to detect if and when they\nwere singing out of tune, and secondly on musical memory. The differing brain anatomical responses\nbetween the two groups of patients\nto the tests were quantified using\nweighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nComparison of images from the\ntwo groups revealed the inferior\nright frontal cortex to be responsible for pitch encoding and melodic\npitch memory and therefore ultimately amuisa. In particular a decrease in the concentration of white\nmatter was observed in amusical\npatients.\nWhite matter is composed of\nmyelinated nerve cells and serves\nto transmit information within\nthe brain and the spinal cord. The\nchanges in concentration of white\nmatter is thought to reflect a larger\nreduction in the connectivity between the pitch processing centre\nof the inferior right frontal cortex\nand the auditory centre of the brain.\nUltimately this revealed the link\nbetween the anatomy of the brain\nand musical behavior that eluded\nresearchers.\nHowever, far from having inherited that toneless crooning from\nyour dad, this disorder could potentially be the result of environmental conditions. The integrity of\nwhite matter in the frontal hemisphere of the brain is thought to be\nvitally important to normal musical\ncompetence.\nA possible lack of extensive exposure to music it is suggested may\nresult in a reduced myelination rate\nof the connecting nerve cells and\nas a result the connectivity of the\ntwo musical centres of the brain is\nimpaired. Hopefully, Krista Hyde\u2019s\nresearch will now go some way to\nhelping all those talent TV shows\nhopefuls understand why their musical efforts are not appreciated by\nthe other 96% of the populace.\nHow do you solve a problem\nlike\u2026congenital amusia?\nTutor for the physics department,\nthe highest percentage of girls the\nphysics department has ever seen\ncurrently resides in the fourth year,\nhitting the heady heights of 25%.\n\u2018But unfortunately it\u2019s been trickling down to just under 20% since\nthen\u2019 he says regretfully.\nA1:4ratiomaynotseemlikemuch\nbut even this is a veritable battalion\nof girls compared to earlier times.\nLooking back in history the ratio\nof female to male physicists exponentially decreases. You\u2019d be hard\npressed to find the female version\nbefore the 20th century as they were\nforbidden access to higher learning\nand laboratories. In the 16th century King James I rejected the idea\nDean Veall\nof educating his daughter reasoning that, \u201cTo make women learned\nand foxes tame has the same effect\n- to make them more cunning.\u201d It is\na relief that this theory is no longer\nbelieved (by the majority at least)\nor we would be lacking some vital\ncontributions to physics today. For\nexample, without women in physics\nwe would not have the nuclear shell\nmodel. Maria-Goeppert-Mayer won\nthe Nobel Prize in 1963 for her discovery of \u2018magic numbers\u2019 (certain\nnumbers of nucleons in an atom\nthat cause it to be extremely sta-ble) and their explanation in terms\nof the shell model.\nGranted, the number of achievements by men far outweighs those\nby women and from the evidence it\ndoesn\u2019t look like the stats are going\nto even out any time soon. However,\nwithout any sign of gender bias it\ndoesn\u2019t seem that there is anything\nfor the feminists to get testy about\nin the Blackett lab. If a girl wants to\nget with the physics program then\nIC welcomes you with open arms.\nAs always in life you can lead a\nhorse to water but you can\u2019t make\nit do a physics degree. On a positive\nnote however, being in the gender\nminority can have its advantages.\nAfter all anything rare is generally\nconsidered valuable. You don\u2019t have\nto be a spice girl to have girl power\nin the physics department. Sisters\nare doing it for themselves.\nWhat? More Science? Well,\nseeing as you asked so nicely\u2026\nFirstly, those fun loving mathematicians at the American\nAssociation of Mathmaticians\nare currently looking for contributions to the 4th annual Math\nArt Exhibition. For more information visit http://www.ams.\norg/amsmtgs/2098_intro.html.\nThe Gresham Society is holding a free lecture on London\u2019s\nEcology at 1pm on October 9 in\nBarnards Inn Hall.\nIf you are having trouble making sense of the universe, then\nMichael Frayn, novelist and\nplaywright, and Paul Davies,\ncosmologist, are talking about\njust that, also on October 9 at\nIPPR, Southampton St, WC2.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t seem to\nhelp, you can always come\nhome to the Sir Alexander\nFleming building at 6pm on October 12 to hear Bernard Carr,\n(Queen Mary, University of London), Paul Davies, (Macquarie\nUniversity) and Rodney Holder,\n(Faraday Institute) explain \u2018Why\nis the universe so uncannily fit\nfor life?\u2019.

Read on to discover a\nmore of an all-round education that happens to be right on your doorstep (Okay, maybe a bit further).\nTo all the freshers reading this, well\ndone for getting to Imperial, and I\ndon\u2019t mean because its a great uni-versity. No, I mean well done for\ncoming to London, because its such\nan amazing city.\nIf, like me, you love art, theatre,\ndance, opera and comedy, then\nyou\u2019ve picked the best city in the\ncountry (if not the world) in which\nto live. If you don\u2019t, then you\u2019ve\npicked the easiest city to acquire\ncultural knowledge without much\neffort, and being able to talk about\nsuch things might even help to get\nyou laid (well, you can live in hope,\nanyway).\nSo for all those who are new to the\ncity (and all those who\u2019ve never left\nSouth Ken) here\u2019s a little guide to\nsome of its highlights.\nLondon is full of galleries. Everywhere you look there are posters\nadvertising exhibitions at the Tate,\nNational, Hayward and Serpentine, to name just a few. Though it\nall seems a bit overwhelming, the\ngreat thing to remember is that\nmost galleries and museums are\ncompletely free (at least for the\npermanent collection).\nTry to avoid the Tate Modern\n(Blackfriars tube) being your only\ncultural experience in London. Yes\nit\u2019s big and exciting and all that, and\ntheTurbineHallisbreathtaking,but\nEmily Lines\nArts Editor\nit\u2019s also always completely rammed\nwith tourists and kids on school\ntrips, which do tend to detract from\nyour enjoyment. Also, some of the\nworks are downright weird.\nSo for a much more relaxing in-troduction, head to the Tate Britain\n(Victoria), where the collection has\nsome of the best of British Art from\n1500 right up to the present day. It\nis also currently hosting the Turner\nPrize exhibition (\u00a35).\nAnother amazing and sometimes\noverlooked gallery is the National\nPortrait Gallery (Trafalgar Square).\nIts fantastic collection provides\na unique record of public figures,\nfrom monarchy in the Middle Ages\nthrough to rock stars of the modern\nday. It is currently running an exhibition of David Hockney\u2019s portraits\n(\u00a36 for students).\nThe West End houses arguably\nthe most famous theatres in the\nworld, and chances are Mum and\nDad will want to \u2018see a show\u2019 when\nthey come to visit. Take full advantage of this and make them pay as\ntickets are outrageously priced (\u00a340\nplus for many shows).\nAlthough Leicester Square is full\nof \u2018discount\u2019 ticket booths, they are\n(in my opinion) largely rip-off mer-chants, selling mostly tickets for\nthe least popular shows at full price\nwith a hefty (\u00a32.50-\u00a35) agent\u2019s fee.\nThe TKTS booth is the only official\ndiscount agent, and sells tickets for\na lot of shows on the day. Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, at the Royal Academy of Arts from October 10\nTwo left feet?\nTry your hand at handball!\nSign up for our free handball\ntaster afternoon on\nSunday 8 October\n2.00 to 4.00pm\nThere\u2019ll be drill practices and technique\ninstruction finishing off with a big match!\nforms are available to download from the\nwebsite or pick one up at reception\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nWant to experience London\u2019s Arts\nscene? Living on a student budget?\nLike free tickets?\nWrite for Arts Felix!\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt sells tickets for up to half price,\nso you can expect to pay \u00a315-\u00a325, although it will never have tickets for\nthe best shows (Billy Elliot, Guys\nand Dolls etc.) or any of the new\nones (Wicked, Daddy Cool) so cannot be relied on. Go with no fixed\nideas, preferably on a weeknight,\nand you might get a good bargain.\nThe only other option for cash-strapped students is last-minute\nstandby tickets. These are sold\nfrom the box-office, usually an hour\nbefore the performance, although\nnot all shows offer them. The National Theatre sells tickets for \u00a310\nfor all its shows 45 mins before\nperformances.\nOpera and ballet have a reputation for being expensive and inac-cessibleformsofentertainment,but\nthis doesn\u2019t have to be the case.\nThe ROH and Royal Ballet (Cov-ent Garden) have a student standby\nscheme that sells tickets for \u00a310 and\nadvertises to students via text messages (register online). The ENO\n(St Martin\u2019s Lane) sings entirely\nin English, and is often much more\ncontemporary that the ROH. Contemporary dance performances\ncan also be found at Sadler\u2019s Wells\n(Angel).\nOf course, London has much\nmore to offer than I can list here, so\ndon\u2019t be confined to South Kensington. Go out and explore the richness and variety, and you might find\nthere\u2019s more to life than science.\n12 felix Thursday 5 October 2006\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

All this was on top of a sturdy\nbackbone of resident DJ\u2019s (includ-ing Rory Phillips of Trash-fame).\nAlthough in a similar vein to\nTrash, Our Disco did without the\n\u2018fascist fashionista\u2019 door-policy and\ntoo-hip clientelle. Musically, there\ntended to be a more electronic bent\nto the tunes on offer, making for a\nlower proportion of Indie Kids on\nthe dancefloor.\nThe final event at Plastic People\nattracted so many people that by\nmidnight the queue snaked most of\nthe way down the street, much to\nthe dismay of anyone hoping to actually get in. We, however, did manage to negotiate our way in at a reasonable hour and enjoyed a fitting\nsend-off for what had, for the past\nthree years, been a staple Friday\nnight outing.\nAlex Baldwin & Greg Mead\nNightlife Editors\nFollowing a couple of events at\nthe overpriced and oversized Canvas in King\u2019s Cross, things did not\nlook good for our beloved clubnight.\nDespite attracting huge crowds,\nCanvas has none of the cave-like\ncharm seen at Plastic People and\non top of this, the entry and drinks\nprices soared well beyond what\nOur Disco regulars were used to,\nthe promise of cheaper drinks for\nthe second Canvas event made for\na considerably better night, the fact\nthat it wasn\u2019t free entry also dissuaded random people just looking\nfor a free night out from attending,\nwhich is probably a good thing in\nthat part of the world.\nThe club\u2019s stint at Canvas climaxed with a night featuring the\nbest in recent French Electro acts\nincluding Justice, Mr. Oizo and a\nbrief live performance from petite\nMiami rapper Uffie.

If\nyou absolutely insist on hosting\none of these parties, you could do\nworse than to pay heed to this brief\nand poorly-constructed selection of\nhints and tips.\nMost people will tell you that the\nmost important part of hosting a\nhouse party is inviting the right\npeople, but these people are wrong.\nInvite everyone in your phone memory and all your e-mail contacts\nand get your housemates to do the\nsame. Invite your next door neighbours and their childen, hell, why\nnot just invite the whole street?\nRight, now you have some people to attend your party, we come\nto the single most important ele-ment: dips. One flavour of dip will\nnot usually be enough, although\nthere\u2019s no need to expand your selection beyond red and white, but\nfor heaven\u2019s sake remember to provide enough crisps, which must be\nsturdy enough for dipping.\nFree booze will also help to keep\nyour house guests interested. Provide some beer for the gents and\nsome tasty punch for the ladies.\nIn conclusion, the only thing you\nneed to throw a great house party\nis drugs, yes lots and lots and lots of\ndrugs.

Prior to the summer\nvacation, Roar was printed every\nthree weeks during term time; the\nnew Roar team will only be producing four issues a year. The make-up\nof staff has also been modified; the\neditorial team no longer have their\nown individual sections to edit. The\n\u2018managing editors\u2019, full-time students who run the paper on a day-to-day basis, no longer exist. It is\nnot clear how the paper will be run\nin future without the work of these\nexperienced volunteers.\nThe removal of the editorial team\nis reportedly the result of 64 students signing up at Freshers\u2019 Fair,\nwith none going on to contribute\nto the paper, though no facts have\nemerged related to how many of\nthe 64 simply chose not to write. In\ncomparison, Felix has in past years\nhad more than three hundred people sign up to write for the paper,\nand has often only added five or six\npermanent volunteers to its editorial team. The outgoing managing\neditor, Lauren Thompson, in comments made to London Student,\nstated that \u201cKCLSU are trying to\ngag their student press\u201d, and suggested that the removal of the editorial team was in fact linked to the\npoor relationship between the sabbatical officers and the newspaper\u2019s\neditors. There have also been allegations that the Kings College management leant on the Union to remove the editorial team, after what\nthe management felt were factual\ninaccuracies in several articles.\nThe changes were pushed\nthrough by the previous holder of\nthe Vice President of Communications post, Sneha Solanki, and the\nex-President, Daryn McCombe,\nalong with several other unnamed\nmembers of the Union\u2019s execu-tive, and announced suddenly to\nthe Roar staff in June. All but one\nof the eight members of the Roar\neditorial team have questioned the\nrationale behind the changes, one\ncomplaining that it would result in\n\u201cutter, utter chaos\u201d.\nEd Drummond, the new VP Communications, has accepted that\nthe changes may not have been\nnecessary, but that they prevented\nRoar from becoming \u201cstale\u201d. Felix\ncontacted Mr Drummond with a\nnumber of questions; a reply came\ntoo late to make it into this issue.\nHowever, on the KCLSU website,\nMr Drummond has posted in the\nsabbatical\u2019s blogging area, asking\npeople to make comments about\nthe future of Roar on a KCLSU\nmessage board \u2013 to date, there\nhave been a total of 8 replies. One\ncomment read: \u201cMaybe the offic-ers/staff/Roar editorial team could\nfigure out exactly what Roar is for,\nand exactly what kind of students it\nis aimed at. Maybe then the content\nwould become obvious.\u201d Mr McCombe has refused to comment on\nthe changes or the reasons behind\nthem, leaving the staff to guess\nwhat the purpose was.\nLondon Student have also faced\nthe threat of closure, or at least\ndamage to their printing numbers\nand frequency. ULU, London Student\u2019s publisher and part-funder,\nhas recently completed a huge Consultation Project on ULU\u2019s serv-ices, involving officers from student\nunions across the city. London Student received a mixed response;\nout of fifteen unions surveyed, only\nfive unions were positive about\nthe newspaper, whereas four were\nfiercely critical of it. Imperial College Union were one of the five that\nrated London Student positively.\nA presentation by one senior ULU\nmanager stated: \u201cThe situation\nwith London Student cannot continue in my view\u201d, referring to the\nfact that newspaper receives 5% of\nULU\u2019s college grant at a time when\nmany other ULU services have\nbeen disestablished.

    "content": "The devil wears Prada?\nInnocent Anne Hathaway\u2019s encounter with the darker side of fashion...\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nThe Devil Wears Prada is a screen\nadaptation of Lauren Weisberger\u2019s\nnovel with the same title. However,\nwhat is it about the book that has\ncaught the eye of the masses? What\nis the tipping point of the novel that\ncatapulted it into a novel with film\nrights? It is undeniable that the\nclassic my-boss-is-a-monster lines\nare rather funny. However, it is the\nrumour that the story\u2019s monster,\nMiranda Priestly is loosely based\non Lauren Weisberger\u2019s experience when working as an assistant for Anna Wintour, US editor of\nVogue that sealed the deal.\nThis is the new generation of\nchick-lit books: The kiss-and-tell-all\ngenre.\nIn this film, Anne Hathaway takes\nthe lead as Andrea Sachs, a fresh\ngraduate from Northwestern University. A serious, aspiring journalist with stereotypical prejudice\ntowards fashion, she winds up at\nMiranda Priestly\u2019s (Meryl Streep)\noffice without a clue to Miranda\nPriestly\u2019s position in the fashion\nworld. Despite her odd-ensemble,\nshe gets hired as Miranda Priestly\u2019s co-assistant. In the beginning,\nshe rebels against the general wave\nof expensive clothes at Runway.\nHowever, she soon crumbles to colleague pressure when she realized\nthat she wanted to win Miranda\nPriestly\u2019s approval.\nWhy does Andy (Andrea) want\nto stay in Runway, a magazine she\ndoesn\u2019t care about? Quoted as \u2018the\njob millions of girls would kill for\u2019,\nthe belief is that once Andy has finished one year as Miranda Priestly\u2019s assistant, Miranda will help her\nto get into any magazine or newspaper she wants.\nHelping Andy along the way is a\nmultitude of interesting charac-ters. A stylish gay man is as crucial\nto the fashion world as clothes are.\nIn this movie, Nigel (Stanley Tucci)\nis the man with the taste that even\nMiranda agrees with. Mild-mannered and a complete gentleman,\nhe assists Andy in her fashion\nchoices with generous helpings\nfrom Runway\u2019s fashion wardrobe.\nThe costume designer for this film\nis none other than Patricia Fields,\nwho is well known for her work with\nSex and the City. And I guess that\nexplains the extremely gorgeous\ngreen Calvin Klein dress which I\nam still hankering after.\nBack to the movie, another interesting addition would be Christian\nThompson (Simon Baker), a successful writer. While he helped her\non an impossible task i.e. to obtain\nHarry Potter books before they\nwere even published, they share\nmore than a favourable working re-lationship. The constant flirtations\nand Andy\u2019s personal attraction for\nhis curly blonde hair and generous\nbuild make him the most unwelcome and yet the most welcome\nthreat to her domestic life with\nAlex, her live-in boyfriend.\nAdrien Griener plays her down-to-earth boyfriend. A one-dimen-sional character just like her two\nfriends, Doug and Lily, they were\nall quite impressed with the side\ngains of Andy\u2019s career at Runway\nat first. However, when it seems\nthat Andy was changing and losing\nher personality just to win Miranda\u2019s approval, the friendship and\nher relationship with Alex slips into\na downward spiral.\nThe movie is definitely not a strict\nabider of the book. However, it is a\nvery neatly-sealed movie that gives\nit a simple and easy-to-follow sto-ryline. Unlike the book, which gave\nin detail Miranda\u2019s various and pe- Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway starring in The Devil Wears Prada\nculiar demands, the movie simply\nused a shortened slide-show method to explain Miranda\u2019s vicious-ness. An aspect that I disagreed\nwith would be the fact that they\nmiss out how Miranda discarded\nher Hermes scarves as if they were\ntissue paper. Miranda\u2019s wasteful\nhabits have to be highlighted if the\nmovie is to generate more revenue\nfor its controversial likeness to\nAnna Wintour.\nAccording to popular opinion,\nMeryl Streep did a great job as\nMiranda Priestly. In fact, the title\n\u2018Devil wears Prada\u2019 could not be\naccurate as trivia tells us that 40%\nof her shoes in the film were from\nPrada. And of course, nobody could\nmiss the obvious scene in the beginning when the camera zoomed in\non Miranda\u2019s bag of choice for the\nday. There are many opinions that\nstate that Meryl Streep gave her\ncharacter an unquestionable sense\nof grace and style. Despite the fact\nthat I agree with their opinions, I\nhave to digress on this portrayal of\nMiranda Priestly.\nIn the book, not much is known\nabout Miranda Priestly. While we\nknow she is unreasonable and dif-ficult, her personal life remains an\nundisclosed issue. In contrast, the\nmovie gives a perspective of Miranda Priestly as a hardened woman\nin her career with a broken family.\nThe movie has softened Miranda\nPriestly into a common stereotype\nthat might have helped with the\nstoryline. Unfortunately, I disagree\nbecause stereotypes are for Disney\nfilms.\nWhile Anne Hathaway did a great\njob as a girl who got lost in the evil\ndrift of fashion, I think she needs\nanother film that can rid her of her\nDisney-princess qualities. Perhaps\nit is a personal cynicism issue, but\nI think the film had a more fairy\ntale-like quality than a sleazy tell-all film.\nThefilmreachesitspinnaclewhen\nAndy realizes that her decision to\ngo to Paris as Emily\u2019s replacement\nhas changed her into a corporate\nhonour-less person. Without giving\naway the ending, I have to say that\nthis is another Disney aspect of the\nfilm. While unreasonable demands\nsuch as Miranda\u2019s might not exist in\nthe real world, it is na\u00efve to refuse a\njob promotion because your friend\nwanted the same promotion. Poetic\njustice is for fairy tales and frankly,\nthe Devil wears Prada should not\nbe a fairytale.\nLastly, I always have a lot of expectations from films. I have read\nthe book two years ago and hence,\nI have my own opinions of it. Therefore, to be fair, the film is indeed entertaining and it is quite a treat for\nthe eyes. When there is Paris, New\nYork, beautiful clothes and shoes\nin the mix, it is a sure-win for eye\ncandy. Nevertheless, be forewarned\nthat it is a comfort-film as it is filled\nwith common stereotypes and an\neasily-digested storyline.\nHathaway\u2019s lawyers refused to sue Starbucks for taking four\nattempts to make the perfect latte maple macchiato.\n13\nfelix\nThursday 5 October 2006\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm times from Friday,\nOctober 6 to Thursday,\nOctober 12, 2006\nPaid Previews\nOpen Season (PG) (RT 1h50)\nSat/Sun only: 10.50 13.10\n15.20\nSubtitled Shows\nWorld Trade Centre (12A) (RT\n2h30) Sun @ 15.10 and Tue\n@ 18.20\nAudio Description\nLittle Miss Sunshine (15) (RT\n2h5) Daily: (10.20 Sat/Sun\nonly) 12.40\nWorld Trade Centre (12A)\n(RT 2h30) Daily: 15.10 18.20\n21.10\nThe Devil Wears Prada (PG)\n(RT2h10) Daily: (10.30 11.30\nSat/Sun only) 13.00 14.00\n15.30 16.30 18.00 19.00\n20.30 21.30 Sat Late: 23.15\nThe Departed (18) (RT 2h55)\nDaily: (10.00 Sat/Sun only)\n13.20 (14.20 Not Sat/Sun)\n16.40 17.40 20.00 21.00\nWorld Trade Center (12A)\n(RT 2h30) Daily: 15.10 18.20\n21.10\nClick (2006) (12A) (RT 2h10)\nDaily: 12.20 15.00 17.50\n20.20\nThe Queen (12A) (RT 2h5)\nDaily: 12.10 14.50 17.30\n20.10\nHoodwinked (U) (1h45) Daily:\n12.30 14.40 16.50\nThe Children of Men (15)\n(RT 2h15) Daily: 12.50 15.40\n18.10 20.45 Sat Late: 23.30\nLittle Miss Sunshine (15) (RT\n2hr05) Daily: (10.20 Sat/Sun\nonly) 12.40\nTalladega Nights (12A) (RT\n2hr10) Daily: 18.50 21.20 Sat\nLate: 23.50\nThe Black Dahlia (15) (RT\n2h25) Sat Late: 22.45\nLife And Lyrics (15) (RT 2h)\nSat Late: 23.00\nGeneral\nshowings\nNew\nreleases\n\n"

    "content": "If you have often sat in front of the\nTV and thought to yourself that\nwhat you are watching is actually\npretty rubbish, then you are part of\na huge society of different nationalities who every day complain about\nwhat they watch, but yet they still\nwatch it. If you are one of these\npeople, and think to yourself that\nyou could make a TV programme\nthat would be much better than\nthis then you need to be part of another society too. I welcome you to\nthe Student Television of Imperial\nCollege; we like to call it stoic tv for\nshort.\nWe at stoic tv work together as\na team to make a wide selection\nof programs such as news, light\nentertainment, short films, the\nnews, and so much more. These\nare then broadcast across campus\nin the Junior Common Room on\nthe walkway, and Da Vinci\u2019s (from\n1-2pm each day, so keep a lookout\nover lunchtime!). And all our programmes (including those from the\nlast two years) are available 24/7 on\nour website, at www.stoictv.com.\nAll these programmes are created by members of our society who\nare generally interested in making\na program or broadcasting in our\nstate of the art studio located at the\nWest Wing of Beit Quad. You will be\nsurprised to know that a lot of the\neffort that goes into a successful\nbroadcasting is not just a good programme idea or a good show; there\nare many behind the scenes technicalities that are very interesting.\nBut that isn\u2019t the only point of stoic\ntv - mostly we\u2019re seeing how much\nwe can get with and how many celeb\nparties we can gatecrash just because we\u2019re holding a TV camera!\nWe offer a range of different shows\nand events throughout the year and\nthere are new programmes this\nyear too, including \u201cAsk The President\u201d, an interactive debate show\nwith the Union President, and a\ncomedy sketch show. Our live news\nshows, where we keep the College\nup to date with the latest goings-on\nand events, are also very popular.\nWe\u2019re holding a few workshops\nto introduce you to our kit (which\nis pretty hot), our studio, and show\nyou some of the stuff we have\ndone \u2013 from films to news \u2013 or more\nimportantly, what you can do. All of\nus are approachable and some of us\naren\u2019t even technical wizards \u2013 me,\nfor example!\nThere is a place here for every-one. We need \u2018front-of-camera\u2019 people as much as technical staff. It\u2019s a\nreally good conduit for an ego that\nneeds a little massaging or a creative writer with a crazy idea for the\nnext Blair Witch Project. Alternatively, if you like lots of attention because you\u2019re holding a large piece\nHey you. Welcome to the wonderful\nworld of ICRadio. First things first,\nthroughout this I will be quoting\nfive songs, whoever comes to our\nfreshers\u2019 beer and biscuits evening\nnext Monday from 6pm (we are in\nBeit Quad in the basement mixing\nup the medicine) with all five answers first will win a mystery prize\nworth around \u00a325. Just to help I\u2019ve\nalready done two of them and for\nthe most part do not make sense in\nthe sentences.\nSo, now for the serious stuff, we\nbroadcast 24/7 at www.icradio.com\nand on 1134AM in Wye. We have\naward-winning shows covering\nmore types of music than you\u2019ve\never heard of, from rock to pop to\nhip-hop with some ska, punk and\njazz, and a whole host of speech\nbased programs. We run all our\ntraining and within 3 hours can\nhave you presenting your own\nshow. In the two years I have been\ndoing this I have gone from pathetically poor to unbelievably average,\nbut that\u2019s the point: anyone can\nhave a go.\nIC Radio gets all the latest\nalbums and singles before the\nshops from major and independent record labels that our music\nteam get to review and sometimes\nreceive free invites to gigs. We\nhave top-notch DJ equipment we\nhire out to other societies, clubs\nand bars for events. We own a\nprofessional level recording facility\nfor any band on the run to rent.\nWe can help you achieve your\ngreatest dreams, God only knows\nwhat you\u2019d be without us (now that\nquote was quite poor and not even\ncorrect).\nWe need presenters, technical\nguys and gals, producers and a\nbucket full of others. We welcome\nany ideas and are able to make\n(almost) anything happen. So get\nstarted and you can play to the\nworld over and over and over and\nover, like a monkey with a miniature cymbal\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019ll see you\nfor beer and biscuits.\nIf you are interested and you\ndarn well should be, email man-ager@icradio.com.

How about you get off your backside and create it!\nIC Radio\nwelcome\nof shiny, technical material in your\nhand then this is the place for you.\nIt\u2019s loads of fun! Just like real TV,\nwe have a national awards ceremony we get to attend every year. Our\nstation won the Best Male, Best Female and Best Broadcaster awards\nlast year (so you could call us officially the best student broadcaster\nin the country!) Who knows, maybe\nyou can help us win something next\nyear?\nThe first step to getting involved\nis attending a freshers workshop\n(whether you\u2019re a fresher or not!).\nIf you like what you see then become a member, sign up to a few\nprogrammes or start one of your\nown. There will also be more formal\ntraining sessions so that you can\nuse our kit to its fullest potential.\nSo we look forward to seeing you\nat stoic tv in the West Basement of\nBeit Quad, or e-mail info@stoictv.\ncom for more details.\nWorkshops\nOur renowned workshops run next\nweek, on both Sunday and Wednesday, and give you a unique introduction to the world of stoic tv, and TV\nstudios in general. The workshops\nconsist of three sessions, each lasting about an hour. The first two\ninvolve producing a short light entertainment programme; it tends to\nbe quite chaotic but it\u2019s always good\nfun. We\u2019re not trying to produce a\nBAFTA award-winning entertainment show, just give you an idea of\nhow things work at stoic tv.\nStudio\nIn the studio you\u2019ll be able to have\na go at being a presenter, which is\ngreat fun if slightly nerve-racking!\nThe ability to talk non-stop is help-ful, but you are largely at the mercy\nof the rest of the crew to feed you the\ninformation you need and do what\nyou are expecting. There\u2019s nothing\nquite like introducing a segment\nand then looking in horror into the\ncamera as you realise you still have\nfifteen seconds left to talk.\nFor the more reserved among us,\nwhy not have a go at controlling a\ncamera, as instructed by the programme\u2019s director. Or you could be\nthe floor manager \u2013 this person is\nessentially in charge of the studio\nand is responsible for making sure\neveryone knows what they are do-ing, from telling the presenters\nwhich camera to look at to counting\ninto and out of video segments so\nthat the presenters know when to\nstop and start talking.\nGallery\nThe gallery is the nerve centre of\nany recording. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll\nfind the boss, or the director. The\ndirector\u2019s job is to keep the whole\nshow on track from deciding what\nthe cameras should do to cueing in\nvideo segments, or just telling the\npresenters to wrap it up because\nthey\u2019re being dull. If you like shouting and bossing people around then\nthis is the job for you, but at the\nsame time you need a cool head\nas you have to be thinking not just\nabout what is happening now, but\nalso about what is happening next.\nThe director works closely with\nthe vision mixer, who controls which\npictures go to tape (or to broadcast\nif it\u2019s a live show). There\u2019s also a\nsound mixer who does a similar\nthing for audio, and VT operators\nwho play in video footage such as\nmusic videos and interviews. They\nalso need to press record at the\nstart of the show, otherwise people\nwill get very upset when you tell\nthem that they have to it all again.\nEditing\nMost programmes need to go\nthrough post-production after being recorded before they make it to\nthe screen. At its simplest, editing\nis simply rearranging bits of video\ninto the right order and length.\nThen you add captions, music,\ngraphics, special effects and more\n\u2013 the list is endless. It can take a\nvery long time but the results can\nbe spectacular.\nTo give you a taster, we\u2019ll produce\na trailer for a film or TV show from\na set of clips we\u2019ve prepared. You\u2019ll\nget to call the shots, deciding what\ngoes where and how to make it look\nperfect.\nIf editing is your chosen art, then\nwe\u2019ll give you dedicated training on\nthe use of our suites so you know\nhow to do all the basics. All you\nneed is creativity and imagination.\nInterested?\nIf all that sounds like fun, then come\nalong and get involved. We\u2019ll be\nrunning two workshops. The first\non Sunday October 8 and again on\nWednesday October 11, both from\n2 to 5pm. And because we all know\nthat bribery works, there\u2019ll be free\nfood, beer, soft drinks and whatever\nelse we can tempt you with.\nMichael Higgins\nStation Manager\nFilming on The Matt And Dave Show. Join stoic tv and you can make television programs too.\n16 felix Thursday 5 October 2006\nlubs& ocieties\nS\nC\n\n"

    "content": "Summer break television\nThe good, the bad, the legend, the cavernous mouth pieces, the manic depressive, the podgy bloke havin\u2019 a\nlaff and the ugly, as well as numerous other clich\u00e9s.\nTom Roberts\nTV Editor\nI never thought I would slip into the\nstereotypical habits of student television viewing. I\u2019ve nothing against\nthose of you who rush home to get\nyour fix of life on Ramsey Street\nor family friendly detective\nshows played out on balsa wood\nsets starring old, white haired,\nshould-be-by-name porn stars.\nI just never expected these\nbrain disengaging, and obviously I mean that in a relaxing\nsense, programs could be so\ncompelling.\nWaking up at 9:25 during the\nweek will never be the same\nagain for me thanks to The\nJeremy Kyle Show during\nthe holidays. Taking over from\nTrisha \u2018get-in-da-kitchen-an\u2019get-me-some-chicken-and-riceand-peas\u2019 Goddard, Kyle has\nbrought his straight down the\nline approach to daytime chat\nshows.\nVarious ogres sporting bigger\ngaps between their teeth than\nthe yellow enamel ridden pegs\nthemselves bound onto the\nstage spouting nothing audible,\nliterally, in order to meet pre-watershed requirements. But\nwhereas you get a sense Jerry\nSpringer\u2019s audience are actually the ones out for blood carrying 6 inches of serrated steel\non their belts, Kyle keeps a serene atmosphere in place at all\ntimes. Calming his audience by\nrequesting boos and jeers are\nwithheld, a bodyguard is rarely\nsummoned. Not that Jezza K,\nas his homies should call him,\nwould ever need them. His combination of brick-shithouse stat-ure, chav hypnotism and \u201ctwo\nsides to every story\u201d attitude\nensures smooth runnings.\nIt is this final point that makes\nThe Jeremy Kyle Show tower\nabove the competition. The\ninitial guest is not necessarily\nthe one who walks unchanged\nor unscathed. Often having\ndespaired that they\u2019ve been\nwrongly done in their life, the\naccused guest enters stage left\nand Kyle deftly probes his way to\nthe bottom of each story giving his\nmeasured advice that the \u2018victim\u2019\nscowls at. Prejudice is thrown out of\nthe window, then down the nearest\ncliff and into the cave at the bottom\non The Jeremy Kyle Show. There is\na real sense\nthat the\nriff raff out\nthere aren\u2019t\nall bad and\ncan change\ntheir ways.\nThis is\ncertainly\na positive\npoint.\nUnfortunately, my\ntaste for\nall things\nstudent didn\u2019t completely change\novernight. The success of Deal\nOr No Deal remains a mystery to\nme. I have never witnessed such\na self-congratulatory, patronising\nand downright daft premise for a\ngame show. Please, before you remove this page of the newspaper,\nwhilst particularly paying attention\nto seeing how many tiny fragments\nyou can tear my emboldened name\ninto, hear me out.\nI congratulate Noel Edmunds\nfor bursting back onto the television scene. Hopefully, this is just a\nplatform for higher prospects, but\nI severely doubt Deal is a short-term affair. My main qualm with\nthe program is the audience\u2019s need\nto clap every bloody time anything\nat all happens. The contestant asks\nEdmunds for \u2018The Question\u2019 in the\nfinal part of\nthe round.\nInevitably,\nthe smug\ngit in the\nhigh chair\nreplies:\n\u201cNo deal!\u201d\nto which\nthe audience claps,\ncheers\nand even\n\u2018woops\u2019.\nThis is not\nan American game show! Why do\nthey shout like they\u2019re at an NFL\nmatch where there is a vast open\nstadium for their cola induced\nwooping to gush out of?\nTaking a step back, why does this\ninsistence on requesting The Question even exist? Is the contestant\nso stupid, he/she has forgotten the\nrules? So stupid, he/she has forgotten that Edmunds has previously\nspoken to the banker who has offered a wodge of cash? No, just like\nthe endless rapturous applause,\nthis is just a device to stretch out\nthe proceedings before the inevitable conclusion is reached,\nfor this is a game show where\nthe prize has already been decided before a cameras have\nbegun to roll!\nDeal Or No Deal is a monotonous game of probability\ndisguised by the black phone\nthat has reset the cement on\nEdmunds career. Rarely do the\ncontestants accept the banker\u2019s\noffers more out of fear of being\ninfinitely booed rather than out\nof sensibility and therefore the\ngame is over before it\u2019s even\ncommenced.\nOne man that can present a\ngame show is Stephen Fry. QI\nis a quiet triumph nestling in\njust beyond the primetime slots\nof BBC2. Whilst QI provided\nplenty of summer evening\u2019s\nentertainment, Fry\u2019s two-part\ndocumentary The Secret Life\nOf The Manic Depressive was\neasily the best viewing during\nthe holiday. Fry suffers from bipolar disorder along with 4 million other people in the UK. In\nthe documentary Fry discussed\nhis condition with incredibly\npersonal insight, as well as visiting friends and folk who cast\nlight on the subject.\nThe program blew away the\nna\u00efve clouds covering my eyes\nand probably many others\nthroughout the UK. I fell into\nthe category of people immediately addressed by Fry as believing manic depression was a\nsimplified way of saying you\u2019re\njust really, really low. Here lied\nthe programs biggest success.\nIn similar fashion to Pete winning Big Brother and successfully drumming up awareness\nfor toilettes, The Secret Life has\nStephen Fry largely to thank for\nits success because of his willingness to open up so much of\nhis life, which could not have\nbeen easy.\nNot since last terms Tony Robinson: Me And My Mum, have audiences had the chance to relate and\nempathise with well known faces so\nclosely. Having been expelled from\nschool and imprisoned largely due\nto his extremes of mood, Fry came\nthrough all of this to get to where\nhe is today. Even more surprisingly\nhe thanks his manic depression for\nthis success. The program is due\nto be repeated in the near future\naccording to the BBC website and\nI urge you to watch if you missed\nout.\nMoving from one intellectual\nextreme to the other, we arrive at\nLoose Women. Riding high on the\nrecent wave of independent women\nattitude largely thanks to Sex And\nThe City and possibly a certain song\nby Destiny\u2019s Child, a group of forty-somethings sit around a table running their mouths about all sorts of\ntopical views. The conversation is\nabout as intellectually stimulating\nas talking to a bottle of botox and\nis comprised of whatever bullshit\nhas been written in Heat or Hello\nor Closer or Cosmopolitan during\nthe week. So, the content doesn\u2019t\nexactly match up to Question Time,\nbut one thing the women do have in\ncommon with the politicians on that\nprogram is that the waffle spewing\nfrom their mouths is unbelievably\nhard to comprehend.\n\u2018Feminism\u2019 is the first word that\nsprings to mind when viewing the\nprogram, but even this isn\u2019t accurate as the opinions are tinged by\na sense of misandry that lies within\nsome of the loose women. Occasionally a special guest of the lesser\nsex is brought out and at this point\nwe may expect a tip in the balance\nof the man hating fuelled conversa-tion, but this adds fuel to the fire as\nthe women out do each other and silence the poor bloke with their endless talking. I\u2019ve already spent too\nlong on this and I feel I\u2019m treading\ninto dangerous territory but television would be a better place without\na live version of OK magazine.\nFrom one program to next via\na tenuous link, we arrive at a program not afraid to offend for the\nsake of comedy with Extras. Andy\nand Maggie make a welcome return\nbut this time the tubby wannabe\nactor has got his own show com-missioned, whilst the dapsy blonde\ncontinues to basically dig holes for\nher best friend to fall into.\nThe hook for the first series was\nthe chance to see famous stars\nparodying themselves but this has\ntaken a back seat as Ricky Gervais\nLoose Women: Giant axe wounds.\nDeal Or No Deal: Noel Edmunds spots an\naudience member with no hands or voice.\nThe Secret Life Of The Manic Depressive: Stephen was feeling\nparticularly pleased with himself after successfully leaving his red\nboxer shorts in a white wash.\nlets the story of come to the fore.\nAndy is rising through televisions\nranks where reality is not all rosy.\nMajor changes to his script are\nmade by those \u2018in the know\u2019 and\nsomehow the hollow gap between\nhis agent\u2019s ears has become even\nmore vacuous.\nUntil the third episode with an hilariously \u2018macho\u2019 Daniel Radcliffe\nand a dwarf known to me as none\nother than \u2018Him from Willow\u2019, Extras suffered slightly from Gervais\u2019\nslightly heavy handed attempts at\ntelling us how much of a struggle\nthe television industry is. Still, Gervais continues to produce comedy\nthat is a cut above the competition\nand each episode is over faster than\nStephen Merchant can unsuccessfully chat up a pair of women.\nThe Charlotte Church Show\ndeserves no tenuous link however.\nI\u2019m going to put as much effort into\nthis summary as it takes to give a\nchavette her own television chat\nshow. The show begins with some\nstat about Cardiff\u2019s crime rate and\ndepicts brawling Welshmen, which\nis not something I\u2019d be promoting if I was constantly pushing the\nfact I\u2019m obsessed with the country I originate from.

    "content": "3\nfelix\nThursday 5 October 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPresident is the only student that\nsits on College Council, his word\nwas trusted. Unfortunately,\nthis has left the names of\nthe constituent faculty unions in disarray.\nThe RCSU, CGCU and\nICSMSU names were\nchosen through student\nreferenda, and have strong\nhistorical significance. In\nthe College Centenary\nyear, in which the College\nis attempting to attract donations from alumni (many\nof whom have strong faculty affiliations), some have\nquestioned the wisdom of\nthis rejection. It is likely that\ncampaigns will take place\nthis coming year to attempt to\nreverse the ruling.\nICFoNSSA (Imperial College Faculty of Natural Sciences Students\nAssociation) and ICSMSU\nbecomes ICFoMSA\n(Imperial College Faculty of Medicine Students Association).\nThe last time\nthe names\nwere taken to\nthe Council,\nthe infamous\nMustafa Arif\nwas President. He\nreported\nback to Union Council that\nthe names had been\naccepted - however, the\nreality was that the names\nhad been rejected. As the\nNew NUS Extra card\nThe National Union of Students\n(NUS) have scrapped discounts on\ntheir card, which is freely available\nto all students of affiliated student\nunions, and introduced a new paid-for \u201cExtra\u201d card that carries the\ndiscount capability.\nThe NUS Extra card costs \u00a310,\nand can only be purchased by students of a union which is fully affiliated with the NUS. The income\nfrom sales of the card is divided\nbetween the NUS and the affiliated\nunion, with \u00a34 being received by\nthe union for each card sold. When\nstudents buy the Extra card, they\nalso receive an International Student Identity Card (ISIC), issued\nby the International Student Travel\nConfederation (ISTC). This popular\ncard is accepted internationally as\nproof of student status, and gives\nthe holder discounts on travel, hos-tels, hotels, restaurants and attrac-tions, as well as providing access\nto the services that ISTC provides,\nsuch as a 24 hour emergency helpline for students abroad. Bought\nseparately, the card costs \u00a37.\nBen Harris, Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare), has said to\nFelix that the annual cost of membership of the NUS would be \u201cabout\n\u00a330,000\u201d, but that the amount could\nvary, though it would rise no higher\nthan \u00a350,000. Imperial College has\naround 11,000 students; should,\nsay, 50% of these students decide\nto purchase the \u201cExtras\u201d card, this\nwill bring the Union an additional\n\u00a322,000 in revenue from the commission on card sales, thus reducing the net amount the Union would\nbe paying the NUS to around \u00a38,000,\nif Mr. Harris\u2019 ballpark figure is to be\nbelieved.\nThe card was initially trialled\nat thirteen Student Unions in the\nnorthwest of England during the\nacademic year of 2005-6, and following a decision made at the NUS Annual Conference in April, the card\nis due to launch nationally for 2006-7. The results from the original\npilot scheme in the northwest can\nbe found on the NUS online support site: www.officeronline.co.uk.\nHowever, it is restricted to those\nwho are registered with the NUS\nand so non-members of the NUS\ncannot see the results, and hence\nreporters at Felix were unable to\nview these as well. Deputy President (Education & Welfare), Ben\nHarris, also could not gain access\nand would not be able to use this\ninformation in any campaign material provided to students during the\nupcoming referendum.\nThe old and free card is now\nknown as the Democracy Card and\nit denotes membership of the local\nand national union. It only provides\naccess to \u201cdemocratic processes\nand to some areas of nusonline.\nco.uk\u201d without any discounts available with it. The card can be purchased online, but only at those\nuniversities that have chosen to\nparticipate in the scheme.\nNUS claim to be committed to the\nsmooth transition of the NUS Extra\nscheme and will keep members updated with the \u201clatest information,\ncase studies and updates.\u201d King\u2019s\nCollegeLondonStudentUnionisdoing it\u2019s utmost to promote the card\nbut it has found some hostility with\nother unions. Clare Solomon, SOAS\nofficer, said to London Student that\nthe scheme \u201c\u2026totally contradicts\nboth our value statements and our\nethical supplier policy.\u201d This was in\nreference to the companies providing the discounts being large busi-nesses, which \u201c\u2026make too much\nprofit.\u201d\nThe introduction of the card has\nprompted questions about the state\nof the NUS\u2019 finances. A report submitted by Salford University\u2019s Union President, Stephanie Walker,\nsubmitted to USSU Council, states\nthat in the year 2004-5, the NUS was\nindebted to the tune of \u00a3700,000, and\nwas suffering an annual shortfall of\n\u00a3200,000. Various measures have\nbeen enacted in order to attempt\nto reduce costs, such as relocating\nto the northwest, and selling offices\non Holloway Road. The report also\nstates that the purpose of the NUS\nExtra card is to \u201crecuperate costs\u2026\nwhich would secure the future of\nnot just the NUS but individual students\u2019 unions as well.\u201d The report\nalso contains a number of interesting points, including the fact that after tax, VAT, and various production\ncosts, NUS will only receive around\n\u00a32.50 per card sold. Felix could not\ngain access to this material first-hand, as Imperial College Union is\nnot affiliated to NUS.\nThe introduction of the NUS Extra card is adding to the debate on\nwhether Imperial College Union\nshould join the NUS. Many still receive student discounts by showing\ntheir Imperial College swipe-card\nand so may see the NUS Extra as\nunnecessary thus the NUS only\nhaving national representative\nbenefits.\nThe NUS referendum is anticipated to take place in November.\nMatty Hoban\nThe new NUS Extra card, which includes ISIC branding\nJCR complete and on time\nThe redevelopment of the JCR finished on time, much to the relief of\nthe sabbs, who had been worrying that the area would not be usuable\nfor Freshers\u2019 Fair. With several rooms in the Union out of use, space\nfor this year\u2019s Fair has been tight. The JCR now has a brand new fast\nfood bar at the far end. Felix enjoyed a rather tasty burger during a\nrather busy afternoon. QT\u2019s is back, and much better looking.\nTanaka students miss Fair\nFelix has learnt that students at the Tanaka Business School had\nlectures scheduled from 9am until 6pm on Tuesday, forcing them to\nmiss the entire Freshers\u2019 Fair. There is a College-wide agreement\nin place that lectures are suspended during Freshers\u2019 Fair. CGCU\nPresident, James Fok, alerted the sabbaticals to the problem, but\nunfortunately it was too late to take any action.\nDa Vinci\u2019s lukewarm opening\nDa Vinci\u2019s was open for Freshers\u2019 Fair; however, the resulting decor\nleft something to be desired. Those responsible have insisted that\nthe bar is not yet finished, and that new furniture will be arriving\nnext week. However, freshers didn\u2019t seem to mind, and the bar was\ncrammed throughout their first few days at the College. As long as a\nbar is open, Felix is happy.\nCollege rejects RCSU,\nCGCU, ICSMSU names\nCollege Council, the highest body\nin the organisation, has rejected\nchanges to the Union constitution\nin the summer vacation that would\nhave settled the names of the\nthree constituent faculties of the\nUnion to Royal College of Science Union (RCSU), City &\nGuilds Union (CGCU), and\nImperial College School of\nMedicine Students\u2019 Union\n(ICSMSU). Any changes\nto the Union constitution\nmust be passed by College Council. As the\nchanges have been\nrejected, the new\nnames of the faculties are\nnow somewhat unwieldy. C&G will\nbecome ICFoESA (Imperial College Faculty of Engineering Students Association), RSCU becomes\n\n"

Our entertainments venues\nat South Kensington, Charing Cross and Wye were packed to\nthe rafters on most nights, indicating (I hope) that our members\nare impressed by our newly refurbished facilities. Freshers\u02bc fair\nwas a huge success and credit must be given to the dozens of\nFaculty and CSC people who worked tirelessly alongside Sta\ufb00 and\nSabbaticals before and after the event to make it run smoothly.\nOf course Freshers\u02bc Week would not be the same without the\no\ufb03cial freshers\u02bc welcome talks, which were attended by nearly\n3000 students on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. If you were\nlucky enough to make it to one of these events and witness the\nCollege\u02bcs extraordinarily cheesy promotion video, then you may remember hearing one or two\nrepresentatives from the Union speak as well!\nI appreciate that the speakers at these talks have an irritating tendency to throw a lot of facts and\n\ufb01gures at their audience in a short amount of time, and I am just as guilty of this sin as any other.\nSo, for the bene\ufb01t of those who didn\u02bct make it to these talks and for the bene\ufb01t of those who did\nbut would like to see more information in print, here is a summary of the welcome speech I gave to\nour incoming students earlier this week.\nWhat is Imperial College Union?\nImperial College Union is many di\ufb00erent things to di\ufb00erent people but in essence it is what you,\nour student members, want it to be.\nWe are the voice of the students of Imperial College: we run a large network of student\nrepresentatives and welfare o\ufb03cers across the whole College. All of these people work tirelessly to\nraise students\u02bc concerns to the College and external organisations about any subject ranging from\nthe quality of lectures and food outlets on campus to campaigning on national issues such as top\nup fees and student debt.\nWe are a community of 11,500 students: we exist to bring our students together through our\ncomprehensive events programme and our plethora of student clubs and societies.\nWe are a federation of clubs, societies and constituent unions: our international societies,\ndepartmental societies, faculty and campus unions represent the diversity of our students at\nImperial and tailor events and activities to their needs and interests. We run over 270 well funded\nspecialist clubs and societies at Imperial College and if none of those interest you then we can help\nyou set up a new society.\nWe are part of a wider student movement: we are part of the London student community and are\npresently a member of the University of London Union (ULU). As Imperial College becomes an\nindependent university in its own right this academic year, we will be forced to disa\ufb03liate from ULU\nand seek alternative means of representation \u2013 indeed there are rumours that a petition is being\nprepared to organise a referendum to a\ufb03liate to the NUS this autumn\u2026\nWe are an advice and support resource: if you have any concerns about your course, your\naccommodation, your health, student debt or employment then please come and visit our\nprofessional student advisor at the Information and Advice Centre in our South Kensington Building\nwho is always happy to help. The Sabbatical team, too, are always willing and able to help you.\nWe are often referred to as a building: when in fact we operate in three buildings (South\nKensington, Reynolds and Wye) and have a presence on almost every campus in the College. The\nBeit Building, which is our main building in South Kensington, is presently undergoing a large and\nexciting refurbishment programme that may cause limited disruption over the next couple of years.\nWe are 100 years old this year! So we will be co-ordinating a wide range of events throughout\n2007, climaxing with our extravagant Centenary Ball, which will be held at the South Kensington\nCampus on 16th June 2007 (put that date in your diaries!).\nImperial College Union exists to help all of the students of Imperial College to get the most out\nof their time at Imperial College. It is an entirely student led and governed organisation, run by\nstudents for students. If you have any ideas about how we can serve our student members better\nor want to \ufb01nd out a little more about how the Union works and how you can get involved in its\nactivities, then please come along to our Freshers\u02bc General Meeting on Monday 9th October at 6pm\nin the Union Concert Hall.\nTFL Discount\n30% discount on Oyster cards\nTransport for London is o\ufb00ering 30% discount on\nOyster travelcards for students at Imperial.\nA Student Oyster photocard entitles the holder to\nbuy student rate Bus Passes and Travelcards valid for\n7 Days, one month or longer periods of up to one\nyear. Students will get 30 per cent o\ufb00 the adult rate.\nStudent Oyster photocards are only available by\napplication and a fee of \u00a35 applies. Please ensure\nthat you read the eligibility criteria before you apply\nas the application fee itself is non-refundable. Please\nnote that if you are registered on a part-time basis\nyou will not normally be eligible for a photocard and\ncannot apply online.\nIn order to apply, you will need:\n\u2022 Your credit/debit card number and expiry date\n\u2022 A digital photograph of yourself saved as a jpeg\n\u2022 Your Imperial College London ID card.\nApply online here:\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/fares-tickets/2006/\nphotocards/18.shtml\nUnion Website\nJoin online now!\nDon\u02bct forget you can join\nClubs & Societies online at\nimperialcollegeunion.org.\nDid you see anything at the\nFreshers\u02bc Fair that took your\nfancy?

    "content": "Chinese Whispers again\nR\nather than starting the\nyear and having Felix\ntalk about the activities\nand indeed the whereabouts of students during\nfresher\u2019s week, this year has started with very interesting news in the\nform of Emily Chow and the Chinese society, seen on the front page\nof last week\u2019s Felix, after solicitors\nacting on her behalf threatened the\nUnion\u2019s President, ex-President,\nand two sabbaticals with legal action unless they reverse the decision to suspend the Chinese society\nfrom any and all activity including\nthe Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nThe Union informed the society\nthat they would not have a stall at\nFreshers\u2019 Fair or be allowed to run\ntheir society until several monetary\nissues are cleared up, including\ncharging \u00a310 for multi-year memberships when it\u2019s illegal to do so,\ntaking money from freshers at\nFreshers\u2019 Fair last year which is\nalso illegal (whoops), and very interestingly organizing an event in\nHong Kong which cost \u00a313 to attend,\nwithout the Union\u2019s knowledge or\nconsent (double whoops). Most im-portantly, a lot of this money, including the money from the Hong Kong\nevent and the extra money from\nthe multi-year memberships, has\nnever been banked into the ICCS\naccount \u2013 thrice whoops.\nSo, because of all this, and I\npromise not to mention the almost\n\u00a32000 debt as an additional reason,\nJohn Sargent applies some good old-fashioned common sense to the laughable\nprospect of Union Officers being sued by one of their constituent clubs.\nthe Union contacted the president\nand treasurer in August. What last\nweek\u2019s article didn\u2019t mention, how-ever, was that the first contact the\nChinese Society had with the Union\nPresident John Collins regarding\nthe matter was the letter from a\nlaw firm in Hong Kong threatening\na lawsuit over the suspension of the\nsociety; I thought this was slightly\nimpolite to say the least.\nIt is very likely that I\u2019ve missed\nabout thirty steps worth of bureaucratic councils, committees, tri-bunals, assemblies, directorates,\nconventions, panels, and governing\nbodies before the situation gets extreme enough to take the issue to\ncourt \u2013 clearly Miss Chow had other ideas, but this author thinks that\nshe probably should have thought\nthis one over a bit more carefully\nbefore she brought in the suits.\nI could refer to the Union consti-tution, the charter, and all sorts of\nrules governing clubs and societies,\nbut it boils down to this: the DPFS\ncan freeze the budget of a society if\nthere are monetary problems, such\nas, let\u2019s say, taking money from\npeople associated with your society\nand not banking it into the society\u2019s\nbank account, otherwise known as\nfraud. The DPCS can suspend a\nsociety for incomplete documen-tation. And since the President is\nresponsible for all Union activities,\nhe can do all of the above and more.\nThis action was taken against the\nsociety, and not against any one\nF\nor the majority of their\nlives, human beings usually try to avoid unnecessary suffering. Perhaps\nthis is slightly different at\nImperial, where the proportion of\nthose with a masochistic tendency\nis higher, but I would hope that this\nbasic part of human character still\nstands within us. Let\u2019s just hope it\ndoes, it\u2019s not like the first week of\nterm isn\u2019t hard enough! So why,\nthen, is there a great proportion\nof campus that is deciding to go\ndeliberately against the grain and\nsearch for pain?\nOK, so maybe it\u2019s your first day,\nfirst year or perhaps coming back\nafter a long summer where you\nmissed out on that addictive uni at-mosphere. You come (back) to your\nfriends, get \u2018chillaxing\u2019 and let the\ngood times roll. That is what life\u2019s\nabout. Each and every action performed by you this week will probably be aimed at acquiring some\nsort of benefit, be it material or\nnot, like making a friend or new acquaintance soon to become a \u201cnetwork\u201d contact. In fact, if you were\nto perform an action that resulted\nin no gain, yet lost time and energy,\nthen you would probably class yourself as a grade A idiot. Right? Now\n\u2013 let\u2019s think. What actions are there\nfrom which you can receive no gain,\nnone whatsoever, yet still consistently undertake the very same\naction?\nFor every act there is most cer-tainly, most definitely, a desired reward no matter who undertakes it.\nThe difficulty arises when trying to\nasses the nature of that reward. Different people from differing views,\nfor instance atheists, Jews or Sikhs,\nall may agree on the same action\nbeing \u2018good\u2019; charity for instance.\nCharity has no overt reward. You\ndon\u2019t really even know that your\nmoney will reach the needy due\nto the thousand obstacles in the\nway. Yet, you give that coin or note\nnonetheless because you feel some\nsort of gain \u2013 perhaps the world will\nbenefit from it (or if you\u2019re really\nclever, to impress someone and get\na bonus, or a raise, brownie point\nor some other deviant material re-ward). But sometimes we act in a\nway that defies temporal logic. Perhaps there is something in human\nnature that pushes each individual\nto strive for more than one\u2019s land,\nflock or pride. But this lifelong push\ntowards being more than what\none already is rests on two factors\nthat seem to be infinitely variable\nbetween different individuals; certainty and purpose. I may perform\nan action that has no reward, not\nin this world at least, yet I have a\ncertainty that there is a much more\nintangible reward and satisfaction.\nIt is not done simply for a material\nreward or for the hope of a better\nliving.\nSo today is the 9th day of fasting\nin Ramadan. Just to refresh \u2013 that\u2019s\nno food, nor water between sunrise\n(about 5am) and sunset (around\n6.30pm). Furthermore, lying, cheat-ing, backbiting etc, are actively discouraged by individuals who are\nfasting, while supplications and\nmeditation over one\u2019s purpose in\nlife increase. There is no fear about\nloss or hunger. If you consider today\u2019s political climate, there isn\u2019t\nany concern about the attitudes or\npossible actions of other people.\nAnd there is no material reward,\nexcept the certainty that God will\nbe happy with you, and that makes\nyou quite happy. It is your view\nabout what happens after life that\nchanges how you acts in this one. To\nmany, this is a dangerous mind-set,\nliable to corruption and the worst\nforms of extremism. But, to others\nit represents a liberation from one\u2019s\nown weaknesses and fears, and becomes the centre of life\u2019s purpose\nitself, and a satisfaction with what\nwill come after.\nFor those who enjoy their suffering...\nindividual such as the president\nor treasurer, so here\u2019s my honest\nquestion: where the hell does the\nlawsuit come into play?\nI should also point out, for everyone\u2019s benefit, that if you infer\nor claim that you have no internet\naccess, it is wise not to go posting\npublicly on Facebook.\nLet\u2019s look at it from another per-spective. This year, I am a committee member of the CGCU Motor\nClub, and we can\u2019t get our funds released because we have yet to elect\na president and treasurer (whoops).\nBecause this isn\u2019t directly my fault,\nperhaps I should sue the union officers so I can get this year\u2019s budget\nreleased. There are two problems,\nthough \u2013 since clubs and societies\nare not actually legal entities, it\nwould mean it\u2019s me suing rather\nthan the club suing. Additionally, by\nsuing officers of the union I\u2019m not\njust taking the Union to court as an\nentity, but also involving Imperial\nCollege. What chance would I have\nfacing the wrath of College, suing\nfor something I can\u2019t sue for in the\nfirst place?\nSo in conclusion, Miss Chow has\ndone nothing wrong, unless you\ncount the whoopsie on Facebook\nand seeking legal action in the first\nplace \u2013 but neither has the Union.\nSurely, then, everyone can start\nworking towards a solution instead\nof being at each other\u2019s throats\nwhen it is certain that this conflict\nwill result in no gain for anyone.\nJohn Sargent\nDear Editor,\nIn his opinion piece on joining\nthe NUS, Mr Guite argues his\ncase in favour of affiliation, but\nhe completely fails to consider\nthe other side of the issue.\nMr Guite talks about a free\nICIS card and discounts one\ncan get with the NUS card;\nhowever, he fails to mention\nthat the NUS card itself is no\nlonger free but costs \u00a310. No\nNUS card, no discounts.\nThis is in addition to the substantial affiliation fee the Union\nwill have to pay. In the last\nreferendum on NUS affiliation\nat Imperial in 2002, 72% voted\nagainst affiliation. This large\nmajority is even more impressive considering that at that\ntime the NUS card was free for\nstudents.\nWe just did not want to affiliate to a body whose politics are\nso far removed from ours. ICU\nhas always been an apolitical\norganisation, focussing their efforts on issues directly affecting\nImperial students as students\nand not getting encumbered\nwith general politics. According\nto the their website, the NUS\nspends quite some time in front\nof embassies, demonstrating\nagainst wars etc, which is fine\nin general but really not their\njob, instead of concentrating on\nstudent issues such as tuition\nfees which they spectacularly\nfailed to prevent.\nThings like this happen when\npeople are only interested in\nclimbing the political ladder\nand see the NUS as a first step\nto do so, as has been the situation for quite some time. Mr\nGuite himself agrees that the\nNUS needs reform. However, I\nthink that he is somewhat over-optimistic when he says that\nwe would be at the forefront of\nreforms if we joined. We would\nbe the new guys, with little\ninfluence. We would be just one\nvoice, lost in the noise.\nNow, let me assume for a\nmoment that the NUS did offer the benefit of lobbying at\nthe highest political levels on\nstudent issues, disregarding\nfor a moment the question of\nwhether it is effective at this or\nnot. Do we really need to spend\n\u00a350,000 for this to happen? The\nNUS would campaign on the\nmost important issues anyway,\nand we would reap the benefits\nwhether we are affiliated or not.\nAnd for the rest we would not\nhave the power to push them\nin a direction they did not want\nto go. So why join and spend all\nthat money that could be put to\nbetter use increasing the funding for our clubs and societies,\ndirectly benefiting all students\nat Imperial?\nDaniel Sauder\nLetter(s)\nto the\nEditor\n\u201cShe probably\nshould have\nthought this one\nover a bit more\ncarefully before\nshe brought in\nthe suits.\u201d\n\u201cBut sometimes\nwe act in a\nway that defies\ntemporal logic.\u201d\nOmar Hashmi\n7\nfelix\nThursday 5 October 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"
