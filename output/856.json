    "content": "The Delator ColumnBy Paul Shanley\nStreet\nof\nShame\nHomophobia hits town. Last Sunday's 'quality' papers\nsunk to new depths with their opinion articles\nconcerning the resignation of. Lord Dervaird.\nThe worst offender by far was the Mail on Sunday.\nIt's 'Black Rod' column-supposedly a parliamentary\nreview-carried a snide eight-line article which started\nby claiming 'I could not care less about the sexual\norientation of the Scottish judiciary' and ended by\nstating the opposite.\nThis pails into insignificance, however, on reading\nthe John Junor column. The author of this nonsense\nis an ex-Fleet Street editor. Until a few weeks ago,\nhe wrote for that bastion of Imperialism, The Sunday\nExpress. They are rumoured to have sacked him for\nbeing too right wing!\nIt would be insulting to repeat the comments Mr\nJunor made. Perhaps an idea of their nature can be\ngleaned from reading the adjacent story-also from\nthe twisted pen of Mr Junor. The (serious) suggestion\nmade called upon the Archbishop of Canterbury to go\nto Lebanon in search of his envoy Terry Waite. If Dr\nRuncie died on this mission, the article reads, there\nwould be a 'consolation of knowing that in death he\nwas achieving more than he has ever done in life'.\nUtter rot.\nOne has to question the morals of the newspaper\nbarons. Only a few weeks ago, The Sun carried the\nheadline 'Actor dies of AIDS' in bold 72 point type\nacross the front page. For an actor to die is sad, for\nsomeone to die of AIDS is tragic. The question is, if\nIan Charleston had died of some illness, or if someone\nout of the limelight had died of AIDS, would it have\nwarranted the same attention? It seems a very sick\nway to sell copy. The Sun is not the most subtle of\nnewspapers, anyway. It is The Sun that described\nAIDS as 'The gay plague'. It is The Sun that hounded\nElton John over allegations of illegal homosexual\npractices in his private life, and it is The Sun that\ncondoned the tagging of gay prisoners in American\ngaols a la Hitler.\nThe McCarthyism displayed to homosexuals is not\na new problem. It appears a shame that more tact is\nnot shown by the media, in these post-HIV days.\nUltimately, the public express their opinions of\nnewspaper credibility by which ones they choose to\nbuy. The tacky side of British journalism, as\ndemonstrated by The Sun, the Mail on Sunday et al,\nis condoned or at least tolerated by consumers. The\nonly way this kind of moral, as opposed to political,\nprejudice can be eradicated is by refusing to purchase\nthose titles that per vay the lie. Until this happens, the\npublic get what they deserve. It is The Sun that is the\ntop selling newspaper in the country.\nPage 10\nRude words\nI don't know what all the fuss was about regarding\nthe Dave Allen show last week. The language was no\nworse than that used in a school playground. The\nshow itself was broadcast at 10.30pm a time well\npast the 'watershed' observed by all channels.\nDoubtless, Mrs Whitehouse's National Viewers and\nListeners Association will make a big fuss about it.\nHowever, every TV set has an on/off button. If\nparents are acting responsibly, they will exercise their\nright to use it or else send their children to bed.\nTelevision companies shouldn't be held responsible.\nIncidentally, having watched the programme, I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd seen in\nyears.\nTubes\nSorry to harp on about tube barriers again. South\nKensington station managers are now behaving much\nmore responsibly. A manual gate is now staffed all\ntimes for those who wish to use it. This has\nconsiderably eased the bottlenecks that were\noccurring at peak times.\nOn the minus side, stage one of the refurbishment\nof Gloucester Road station is complete. Lots of tube\nbarriers are in place. As has happened with other\nstations, LRT staff see this as an easing of their\nworkload. They are quite happy to watch people\nhaving difficulty using them, especially the disabled,\nelderly and mothers with small children.\nAt Easter, FELIX will be sending a camera crew\ndown to Gloucester Road to film commuters having\ndifficulties. The prints will, of course, be sent to\nLondon Underground. In the meantime, if you use the\nstation, insist on using a manual gate.\nBad bets\nBetting scandals are rife in the sporting world. A fortnight ago, former Swindon Town manager Lon\nMacari was charged by the Football League with\nplacing an illegal bet. Early this week, snooker star\nSilvino Francisco was arrested, but not charged, with\nbetting irregularities in a match with Terry Griffiths.\nSubstantial wagers were placed on the match, which\nGriffiths later won 5-1. Bookmakers suspended\nbetting 37 minutes before the game commenced.\nIn the case of the former, there is no question of\nmalpractice involved. The bet was placed, it is\nclaimed, as insurance against Swindon getting\nknocked out of the FA cup at an early stage.\nRules, however, have to be obeyed. There is no\nessential differences between insuring against a loss\nand fiddling the result.\nI hope that the action taken will be consistent. If\nthere is the possibility that a player or club have\ndeliberately thrown a match, the individuals involved\nshould be banned from their sport for life.\n\n"

    "content": "Hardened Balloonies\n'Scuse me mister, can I have a go?' were the first\ninquisitive words of a young Yorkshire lad who\ncouldn't quite understand why we had just landed a hot air balloon in his school playing field.\nWe had driven to Harrogate with GBNRU, the\nCollege's77 thousand cubic feet hot air balloon. Why\nHarrogate? You may well ask. What would possess\nanyone to spend their New Year's weekend driving\naround the lanes of West Yorkshire, following a hot\nair balloon? Once you have flown in a wicker basket,\n1,500 feet up, in complete silence, it makes all the\nsupport work worthwhile.\nHarrogate was the venue for the Brass Monkeys\nballoon meet: three days of organised chaos with\nthirty balloons flying from and into Harrogate,\norganised by the Pennine region of the BBAC.\nMy one flight of the weekend started in a pasture\nfield of a friend of a friend's farm, about four miles\nsouth of Harrogate. The envelope was soon inflated,\nready for take off and the pilot burned lots of propane\nto get the envelope full of very hot air to give us a fast\nclimb. The quick-release open, we shot skywards,\ntaking us over the PCZ (restricted flying area), and in\nthis case a stud farm which we had to clear at 1,000\nfeet. I was navigating, keeping tabs on our position\nas the wind blew us towards Harrogate's 'The Stray',\na200 acre park. The pilot took us down to about 250\nfeet, making navigation harder, as the view was not\nan exact copy of the map.\nThe impending gloom of the late afternoon and a distinct possibility of not being able to reach our\nintended landing site, forced a premature landing.\nDescending again, there was an obvious field ahead\nwithout crops, cattle, power lines or farmers. Passing\nover a wood we dropped to 50 feet and looked down\nonto a gold course (not a good landing site) and\ncrossed the road at 30 feet.\nOur landing site lay on the other side, and by\nopening the parachute vent in the crown of the\nballoon, we dropped into the field. Knees bent,\ngrabbing the struts and rope handles, we braced\nourselves for touch down. A quick burst of propane\nsoftened the blow, and we bumped and bounced\ndown the field until the balloon was no longer\nbouy ant. Unlike my previous unceremonious landings,\nthe balloon stayed upright while we waited for the\nretrieve crew to arrive. They were sitting in the lounge\nbar of the Granby Hotel in Harrogate, next to our\nexpected landing site. Marcus went off to use an\nonlooker's earphone to give our position, and\neventually they arrived and loaded the gear out of the\nfield into the van.\nThat was the last flight of the weekend, and as it\nwas not dark, we went off to refuel, then back to our\nhosts in Otley for a New Year's party. Many of the\nother balloonists stayed at the hotel to do a 'night\nglow' that evening in the car park, putting the burners\non and taking off to about 20 feet on a tether. This\nmakes the envelopes look pretty with the balloon lit\nup from inside, it also keeps the sponsors happy. Five\nbleary faces crawled from their sleeping bags on\nMonday morning, 'great party', and staggered to the\nvan for another dose of the Ml. Ballooning is the sort of sport where you can spend\nhours waiting for the right conditions, but when you\nfinally get airborne it's an incredible thrill. Many of the\nIC club members are pilots under training, and getting\nyour pilot's licence is very possible before you leave\nCollege. If you fancy being a passenger and seeing\nwhat people get so excited about, or if piloting is your\ngoal, come and see us.\nThis term, trips are planned to Newbury and\nCambridge and we are planning to take part in one of\nthe huge European or Canadian balloon meets this\nsummer. IC Balloon (not condom) Club meet at 1pm in the Southside Upper Lounge every Thursday.\nStudent Christian Movement\nAlright, alright, I admit it. I have got an ulterior motive.\nThe new IC SCM group. Sorry, Student Christian\nMovement^you know, political, social, international,\nquestioning, having a good time, that sort of thing.\nAnyway, what I was going to say is, people don't really think any more round here. I mean, look at IC\nitself. A formless conurbation of impersonal\ntechnological architectures, (OK, just for you I 'll try\nto make them a bit shorter) with people too busy to\neven (so you're fussy about split infinitives too, are\nyou) get anything DONE. Or THOUGHT. Where's the\nfeeling of community? The meeting of minds? The\ncoming together of disparate cultures? (Yes, I have\nbeen to the Southside Bar. That wasn't what I meant.)\nAnd this pre o cup ation with MONEY. Well I suppose\nwe've got the Government to blame for that. (What\nabout Eric Ash? Let's leave him out at this stage,\nplease.) And frankly it's hard to credit, with all this\nfrantic Science and (Vorsprung durch) Technology and\n(hi there, St Mary's) Medicine going on that some\npeople actually manage to believe in God. What about\nme? Listen, can we leave this till later? No? Well yes\nI do, but not like that, much more, well more sort of\nvague, magical but kind of practical sense.\nNo, it's not Religious Pragmatism. Well maybe it is.\nWhat I was about to say is, there's got to be more\nto it than that. Say: maybe what's needed is a bit of\nspace to attack things, ponder them, infiltrate them,\na bit of sabotage of the old preconceptions. And\nmaybe, perhaps, regain that spirit of\ncommunity...who are you calling a bloody idealist?\nWhat's wrong with being an idealist?...Now I hoped\nyou'd say that. No really, you've got to believe I mean\nit. Well it's every Tuesday at half five, in the\nChaplain's Office (you've got to start somewhere),\nthat's the basement of 10 Princes Gardens.\nSCM, yes, I thought I'd told you what it stood for.\nAnd it's going to be brilliant. (Don't be insane! You're\njust the sort of person it needs.) And probably good\nfun too.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Whatever happened?\nvj as1, ca^ \u00b0\n^0 \\Vdtf at^, da^e\\., A vo a a. \u201e c, as v\\ VP vJ aV saw\nCa\\c^ WU Have you ever wondered what happened to that\ncandle?\nOnce upon a time, not so long ago, there was a little\ngirl, and her name was Emily. Now Emily had a shop,\n(imagine one of those shops which have all been\nturned into antique or tea shop pes, the ones with\nbeautiful Georgian glass bow-fronted windows), but\nit wasn't an ordinary kind of shop, because it didn't actually sell anything. Everything in the shop was\nsomething that Emily had once found, and had\nbrought home to Bagpuss.\nHe was the most marvellous, the most magical, the\nmost wonderful...sag gy old cloth cat, in the whole\nworld.\nOne day, Emily found a thing. It was long and thin,\nand it was big. It was very big, In fact, it was so big\nthat Emily had to go and chat up a man she knew,\nwho had a big truck, so that she could take it home\nto Bagpuss.\nWhen she had got the thing home, and had carried\nout her bargain with her friend, the man with the big\ntruck, she put the thing in front of Bagpuss, and woke\nhim up...\nBagpuss,\nBagpuss,\nGreat fat furry cat-puss,\nWake up and see the thing that I bring.\nWake up,\nBe bright,\nBe golden and light.\nBagpus, oh hear what I sing.\nShe used to sing, but, being a bit tired after her\nbargain with her friend, the man with the big truck,\nshe just shouted in his ear.\n'Wake up, you lazy g it!' Nothing.\nSo Emily did something.\n'Wow!' said Bagpuss, 'Do that again! Please!'\n'Not until the children have all gone home.' said\nEmily.\nAnd, of course, when Bagpuss wakes up, all his\nfriends wake up, (which can make some of the things\nhe used to do very embarrassing). The mice on the\nmouse organ woke up and stretched. Garbiel the toad,\nand Madelaine the rag-doll woke up and stretched.\nProfessor Yaffle, the woodpecker, climbed down off\nhis book-end, and went to look at the thing, as did\nall the others.\nIt was indeed a big thing. It was about thirty feet\ntall and four feet in diameter, and had some very\nderogatory things about the RCS painted on the side.\nThe mice went off and got their buckets and mops\nand other assorted cleaning equipment, and set to\nwork on the thing, singing...\nWe will wash it,\nWe will scrub it,\nWe will give it a rub, rub, rub...\nExcept, that is, for Willie Mouse, who suddenly\ndiscovered what an inferiority complex was, and went\noff to have it on his own. Professor Yaffle also\nvanished. He was, after all, only a little pecker.\nThe mice were all tired out, when they had finished\nwith the thing, and they went off somewhere to have\na cigarette. Curiously enough, it seemed even bigger\nafter the mice had finished.\n'What do you think it is?' asked Gabriel of\nMadelaine.\nMadelaine just grinned, and blushed. So he asked\nBagpuss, instead.\n'Looks like an old bit of water pipe, filled up with\nwax, and with a ship's mooring line going up through\nthe middle.' said Bagpuss. 'But I can soon find out,'\nhe added, and telephoned Shaun Crofton.\n'Says it's a candle,' said Bagpuss, three weeks\nlater, when he'd finally managed to get through.\n'Oh,' said Emily, in a disappointed sort of way\n'Never mind,' said the mice, 'we'll put it in the\nwindow, anyway.'\nAnd they did, which was pretty incredible, since it\nweighed some eight tons, and all of them together\ndidn't outweigh a bag of sugar. Unfortunately for\nWillie Mouse, he had chosen to sit and sulk in the shop\nwindow, and it really was a very big thing. \u2022\n'That's got rid of that little shit.' thought Bagpuss,\nfor Willie Mouse really had been getting to be a pain\nin the arse.\nThen, Bagpuss gave a big yawn, and settled down\nto sleep. And when Bagpuss goes to sleep, all his\nfriends go to sleep, which rather pissed them off,\nbecause they tended to keep getting caught in the\nmiddle of something.\nThe mice were ornaments on the mouse organ.\nGarbriel and Madelaine were just dolls.\nProfessor Yaffle was a carved, wooden, book-end,\nin the shape of a woodpecker.\nAnd Bagpuss himself, once he was asleep, was just\na sag gy, old cloth cat...baggy, and a bit loose at the\nseams.\nBut Emily loved him (at least, until she found out\nabout him and Madelaine, anyway).\nThe End.\nAndrew Smith.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Eric Clapton\n'Brilliant!' I don't think I could describe it any other\nway. Yes, I'm talking about Eric Clapton at the Royal\nAlbert Hall. All seated tickets were sold out by\nNovember so only standing tickets are available. Not\nsuch a disadvantage. All were bopping out of their\nseats before the concert was even half-way through.\nAh yes, the concert. About three quarters of his new\nLP Journeyman was played, sounding even better live\nwith just three other musicians. Then we have some\nof the old favourites interspersed; / Shot the Sherriff,\nWhite Room, Wonderful Tonight and many others.\nClapton played for well over two hours, finished at\n22.55 hours.\nThe support band was Zucchero Sugar Fornaciari,\ncurrently Italy's biggest ever star. His two most recent\nalbums have sold more than three million copies\nbetween them. To coincide with his live performances\nin the UK, he will be releasing a British LP, a compilation of his successful tracks, some re-worked\nby Zucchero with English lyrics.\nTechnically speaking, the concert was superb, with\nsingle, but extremely effected lighting and better than\n\u2022expected sound quality given the acoustics of the\nRAH.\nIf you fancy a good night out, at exceptionally great\nvalue, you'll need to start queueing outside the RAH\nbox office by 4.45pm; tickets go on sale from 6.45pm at \u00a3 1 1 . Note, only 300 standing tickets available each\nnight, so don't leave it too late.\nJeremy.\nIndie pop spectacular\nI think everyone who went to last week's Carnival\nthoroughly enjoyed the night, even if some of you tried\nare in act ment of a Milk Tray advert to scale the back\nof the Union Building and bypass security. And all\nbecause the lady loves...The Men They Couldn't Hang. All of the bands played to rooms heaving with\nappreciative audiences, and the spinning mixes from\nthe fingertips of a guy called Gwyn kept body and soul\non a party high until the wee small hours. Many thanks\nto all those who helped on the night to make the\nCarnival such a success.\nAfter a weekend of Perrier water, television and\nearly nights, the Ents crew are fully recovered from\nthe rig ours of last Friday and ready for more aural\nassault, starting tonight. It's an Indie Pop Spectacular,\nwhich roughly translates into two bands who play\nguitars and things (like drums), a late bar, and a disco\nbased around independent popular music. (Aren't Kylie and Sinitta etc, etc on an independent label?)\nThe bands in question are Rain and The Septembers\nwho are nothing like Kylie and wouldn't be seen dead\nwith Pete Waterman. Both play good rockin', guitar\ntwanging, foot stomping songs, and are currently\ntouring the London gig circuit. Catch them before they\nstart recording cover versions of Little Anthony songs.\nThis gig will be well worth a visit, and there are\nrumours of another of the world famous Ents Bar Quiz\ncompetitions. Tickets are only \u00a31.50 in advance, and\nFREE to Ents cards holders. Bargain! See you later in\nthe Union Lounge.\nRufus Isaacs.\nRoyal Albert Hall 23.01.90\nPsychedelic Furs Competition\nTwo free tickets STILL to be won... Just answer the questions below and get the answers to the FELIX Office\nbefore Tuesday 30 January to win two tickets for the concert at Brixton\nAcademy on February 6:\n1. Which two members of the band are brothers and what do they play?\n2. Who di signed the cover of the band's first album?\n3. Tie-break: How many singles have Psychedelic Furs released since\nthey formed?\nThe winner will be drawn from the correct, closest or wittiest entries on\nTuesday and printed in FELIX on Friday 2 February,\nClint Poppie Expose\nClint Poppie of mega pop band Pop Will Eat Itself\npublicly exposed himself at Camden Palace on\nTuesday 17th. Waved He waved his tool at two inter pid FELIX reporters with\nno apparent shame, but detailing the incident any\nfurther would fall into blatant pornography.\nMore? Such an incident along with the fact that it has\nhappened before leaves one only to worry of the\nfurther consequences for the band.\nWill it happen on stage?\nAnother Jim Morrison flasher scandal?\nOnly time will tell\nNEXT WEEK: Ian Brown of The Stone Roses shows\nus his willy!!\nFull Carnival review next week Page 6\n\n"

This is a55 mile hike over\nDartmoor, the object being for the teams of six to walk\nfrom checkpoint to checkpoint, which are situated on\nthe summits of the many tors, going through ten in\ntwo days. The event has been running for about 30\nyears now and is open to young people, from both\nmilitary and civilian organisations. Too easy? Please\nread on...\nThis year's 'Ten Tors' takes place on the 19th and\n20th May and we hope to enter two teams. The\nselected few will be driven down to Okehampton on\nthe Friday, where we stay at the Army base. The walk\nbegins at 7am on the Saturday morning following a rude awakening from the Army controllers playing the\ntheme tune to Chariots of Fire\\ Each team will then\nwalk for 10 to 12 hours, stopping only for food and\n'blister control' and should hope to cover about 30\nmiles (6 tors) by nightfall, when the checkpoints close,\nforcing the teams to stop and camp. Another early\nstart on Sunday morning is necessary in order to cover\nthe remaining 20 to 25 miles before the finish time\nof 5pm.

After the kit checks (there are various\ncompulsory items) and the talk on 'Safety on\nDartmoor', we pitched the tents and ate heartily.\nHaving been woken almost before we had gone to\nsleep by Chariots of Fire, played over the t annoy system, we got up, packed and had breakfast (Gavin's speciality, burnt ready-bre k ll). We packed our rucksacks and made our way to the\nstart, where we spoke to other teams who seemed\nsurprised we had never seen Dartmoor before. Prestart chats always make you nervous when others\nappear to be more familiar with the course, and this\nwas no exception! The awaiting teams, about 2000\nyoung people, were addressed by Colin Moynihan,\nprayed for by the Padre and then started. We were\noff on our way to the first Tor, with map and compass\nin hand. Team spirit remained high despite the rough\nterrain and the reappearance of Gavin's hot chilli with\na number of us. At each checkpoint we had a five\nminute break whilst our 'route card' was processed,\nwhich showed we had covered the ground and is used\nas a safety check. Sometimes we were even given\na kit search.

By now it was\nsheer determination and chocolate that got us\nthrough. We all walked in together, as we had been\nall the trek, bracing ourselves for each painful step\nforward, but in silence as we had run out (or walked\nout!!) of conversation except for discussing the map\nreading. We were given our medals and met by Gavin,\nwho nursed us back to the minibus -where we\ncompared blisters, listened to the Charts and fell\nasleep.

    "content": "The Rector is wrong\nDear Dave,\nThe decision taken by College to cut funding in the\ncareers service demonstrates an amazing lack of\ninterest in students by College administration. The\nprovision of student services such as careers,\naccommodation and welfare are not luxuries; they are\nessential services that need to be maintained.\nThe College should by all means investigate\nalternative forms of funding in services but not at the\nexpense of decreasing the level of support. In\nassessing possible sources of funding, the\nManagement Planning Group could do well to look at\nprofit-making parts of its own organisation, such as\nthe College-run companies and bars.\nIn addition, instead of cutting essentials, why isn't the Rector looking at trimming other less necessary\nservices? The salary of an information officer and an\nassistant is scant when compared with the cost of\nrunning the HUB Office. It is true to say that the office\nadministrator, Lady Ash, is unpaid. However, the\nsame cannot be said of the secretarial support she\nreceives. Likewise, with the office space and facilities\neg phone bills, Apple Macs, laser printers etc.\nWould the HUB Office exist if the Rector's wife was\ngainfully employed somewhere else?\nCollege are already in danger of deterring sixth\nformer s with their high rent levels. If word gets round\nto prospective undergraduates about the removal of\nthe careers service, UCCA applications are going to\nplummet.\nYours,\nPaul Shanley.\nSmall Ads The Rector is right\nDear Dave,\nUniversities have been subject to an increasingly\nferocious financial squeeze for more than 15 years.\nThe actions we have to consider in order to keep\nafloat, invariably involve the weighing of unpalatable\noptions. That is the back cloth to the problems of\nfinancing of the Careers Centre, to which you referred\nin your column last week.\nA few facts: The industrial contribution of \u00a313,000\nper annum is not 'profit'. It is a modest contribution\nto the overall costs of the Careers Centre. The\npossibility which MPG considered was one which is\nthe norm in the USA to recruit a number of post\ngraduate students to assist in running the library.\nThere are pros and cons to this approach. However\nthere is no possibility of the industrial contribution\nbeing endangered by so doing-I have confirmed this\nperception with Mr Russel Clarke.\nThe problem to be solved is to obtain a more\nsubstantial contribution from industry. At present two\nfirms provide very substantial help: Kodak in\nseconding Mr Terry Mettric, and BP in seconding Mr\nBill Fox. Both of them make a marvellous contribution\nto the Careers service, bringing great experience from\nindustry to bear on the problems faced by individuals.\nThe contributions from the rest are somewhere in the\nrange of 'modest' to 'token'. Yet the search for talent\nis at present the first imperative for any company. The\nrecruiting costs for a single graduate are in excess of\n\u00a310,000. Now look at the case of a single firm-a management consultancy enterprise. They recruited\n23 of our graduates last year. No doubt they will\nrecruit as many again this year. It is not unreasonable\nto ascribe a figure of a quarter of a million as lying at\nthe basis of the College's interaction with that firm.\nI believe that they could afford a substantial annual\ncontribution to Imperial College\u2014and by substantial\nI mean a significant fraction of the salary of an\nInformation Officer. So far they have not even been\nasked...I believe that we should re treble our efforts\nto obtain support from industry and commerce for an\nactivity which is a vital service to students but equally\nvital to their future employers. If we could make\nprogress in this direction it would ease the problem\nfaced by MPG in deciding the people power that we\ncan afford.\nI must take issue with you, Dave, in what I read as\na denigration of the role of Departmental Careers\nAdvisers. I believe the Department to be the natural,\nfirst resource for students seeking guidance on future\ncareers and employment. The Departmental Careers\nadviser is the focus of this activity, but in most\nDepartments (certainly the one in which I worked at\nUCLI, most members of staff are involved. The totality\nof experience in a Department, is a very considerable\nresource. Most people will give disinterested advice.\nBut of course they are within a subject domain. It is\na two-edged weapon: on the one hand they may\noverestimate the charms of that subject and the\nassociated career; on the other they will have an\nexpertise within it which cannot be matched by\nanyone outside.\nThe Central service is essential-quite apart from\nthe central organisation which is needed in order to\ninterface with the companies. By commending the\nDepartmental contribution I do not in any way wish\nto undervalue the benefits which students can derive\nfrom professional careers advisers. Their role takes on\nparticular importance for students who have no clear\nnotion of what to do next, or students who want to\nembark on a career which is not related in any way\nto their undergraduate studies.\nFinally, your nihilistic assessment of the stimulation\nprovided by 'every course in the College' simply does\nnot accord with what I hear from students-even\nwhat you could read in the Alternative Prospectus.\nThere are sparkling courses there are no doubt some\nbad ones, and probably a lot in the middle. Why damn\nthem all? One reason why a lot of students leave their\nsubject is because the other options pay well and give\nearly opportunity of superior responsibility. That is a challenge for high technology industrial employers.\nSome of them, I am glad to say have appreciated the\npoint.\nYours,\nEric A Ash.\nSee editorial for reply\nAnti-Welsh behaviour\nDear Dave,\nWhat a fine feature the calendar was in this week's FELIX-so helpful!\nHowever, I'm rather disappointed to see that\nalthough you have St Patrick's Day marked down,\nPage 14\nyou've forgotten St David's Day.\nWe are outraged, heartbroken and mortally\nwounded by this Anti-Welsh behaviour.\nTwo Welsh Elec Eng 1st years.\nADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Bass player seeks band.

    "content": "Film\nPiravi\nFilm\nCasualties of War\nWell, here we are, barely a month into the new year,\nand already two Vietnam movies. Has Brian De Palma\n{The Untouchables) directed a movie that will stand\nout from the crowd? He's used a true story, first\nreported in The New Yorker in 1969.\nEriksson (Michael J Fox) is the 'cherry' of a squad,\nhaving been in country for only three weeks. An\nidealistic young man, he has enough courage to stand\nup to his sergeant, Meserve (Sean Penn), when an act\nis c omitted that Eriksson finds morally unacceptable.\nMeserve, unbalanced by the death of a radio operator\nin a supposedly friendly village, decides to take a little\n'portable R&R' with the squad on the next mission.\nThey kidnap a young Vietnamese girl and rape her.\nThe film divides neatly into two parts. The first tells\nof the events leading up to the abuse of the girl, and\nthe second deals with Eriksson's quest for justice,\nagainst a system geared to ignore crime in wartime.\nBoth the lead actors turn in a strong performance.\nOnce associations with his past work are forgotten,\nit can be seen how well Fox has been cast, portraying\na very young man caught in a moral struggle between\nstopping what he believes is wrong, and his loyalty\nto the squad, and especially the sergeant who saved\nhis life.\nPenn gives human depth to a character that could\nhave been a one-dimensional 'nasty piece of work',\nallowing us to see the sergeants motivation for doing\nwhat he did.\nThe rest of the cast are not so lucky though, coming\nacross as very predictable characters, who never\ndevelop a real personality.\nOn the whole, the film is very intense with the\ntension mounting nicely, but it is marred by several\nrather obvious set pieces, portraying what a 'nice guy'\nEriksson is. The opening and closing scenes, set\napproximately in the present day are pure corn too.\nThe main failing of the film is that little or no attempt\nis made to portray the true horror of what happens\nto the girl. She become merely a pawn in the struggle\nbetween Eriksson and Meserve, without any\nsemblance of a character of her own, her only role is\nto react to what happens to her.\nAny film which relegates such a hideous crime as\nrape to the sidelines, while investigating injustice is\nseriously flawed.\nAdam T. Streetwalker\nThis is billed as an opera-it is a misnomer in that the\n'music' is more sound-effects. There are no tunes, and\nmuch of the dialogue is spoken English, sometimes\nseeded with a rhyme or two. There is continual usage\nof expletives c once ring and denigrating sex. There is\noften repetition of phrases to pummel the point in, and\nfrequently the phrases are sung in a monotone, very\nloudly, each of the five singers on a different note.\nIt relies on heavy atmosphere rather than plot to\ndisplay the utter nastiness and sordidness of ordinary\nlives-in this respect it has similarities to the film Last\nExit to Brooklyn. It is an unusual and stimulating\nformat.\nThe 'opera' is based on six engravings by William\nHogarth set in seventeenth century London. They plot\nthe downfall of an innocent Yorkshire lass on her\nPage 4\ncoming to the big city. She is pulled into harlot ry and\nvarious other vices; it is a cautionary tale of first order\nhypocrisy and supercilious ness. The playwrights\n(Christina Jones and David Joss Buckley) are\ntwentieth century and have overlaid modern values.\nThe brothel keeper, Madame Midnight-ades an it is ed Fagin, is heard to say 'Men are so suspicious of a woman with wit' when advising her prostitutes on\nhow to behave in bed. Indeed the most effective\naction in the piece is when our fallen heroine is trying\nto find custom by opening her arms and shawl, smiling\nand closing her arms and then repeating in a very\nmechanical and disturbing way.\nThe ending of the tale is rather impenetrable\nalthough the absolutely final twist is all too clear.\nThe twist is expected for a while simply because\nDo you watch subtitled films for the sex? Bad luck,\nthis film hasn't got any-just some serious tension.\nPicture this; a damp remote village in India,\nChakyar, a decrepit old man, his invalid wife and soon\nto be married p lumpish daughter. We start with\nChakyar or dad looking forward to his only son\nreturning from University. Dad makes the arduous\njourney to the bus stop by foot and ferry. His son is\nnot on the bus. Next day he repeats the journey, but\nagain no son. Then a University friend reluctantly\nadmits that the son has been taken away by the\npolice.\nThe distressed dad now makes the long journey to\nthe university. He enquires about bis son's disappearance, but is fobbed off by officials. However\nhe is naive and returns contented. His daughter is not\nso easily fooled and journ ies to town where she learns\nof her brother's fate.\nThis is director Shaji's first feature film and it shows.\nHis previous experience was with short films. Piravi\nsuffers from being too long at 110 minutes. It is\nheavily padded with persistent shots of the beautiful\nbut irrelevant scenery and arty symbol is ation. Shaji has tried to build up tension, but the plot is\nnot a firm enough foundation. The plot is so weak it\nmakes Knight Rider look well thought out.\nThe camera work was often dod gy. Some scenes\ngave me flicker vertigo and left me with a headache.\nMany of the scenes were too dark, even allowing for\nartistic effect.\nOn the plus side the acting was excellent. The\ncamera often lingered on just an actor's face for many\nseconds. Without exception the feelings could just be\nread off the face-absolutely superb.\nWould I recommend it? The film is subtle in that all\npolitical events are off-screen, yet the oppression is\nalways present, with the use of clever parallels.\nHowever to my taste the film is far too long and flags.\nThe film ends with the father starting to go insane.\nWe never discover the whole truth about the son.\nPiravi won the Charlie Chaplin award at the 1989\nEdinburgh Film Festival and the Grand Prix at Locarno.\nIt opens at the ICA Cinema on Friday 26 January for\nthree weeks and plays daily at 5.00, 7.00 and\n9.00pm. Charles Tomkins.\nTheatre\nthe play is set in the past and any self-respecting\nplaywright wanting to write a cutting social critique\nis bound to try to bring it up to date.\nThe acting was good; the singing was adequate for\nthe music and my only minor complaint is that the\nheroine (played by Christina Jones) did not have a brilliant singing voice and had a very dubious Yorkshire\naccent. Also she was the only one of the three\nprostitutes that managed to remain attractive even\nwhen she was racked with dip theria. Streetwalker is on at the Bush Theatre, in the Bush\npub next to the BBC TV Theatre on Shepherd's Bush\nGreen. The closest tube is Shepherd's Bush. It costs\n\u00a34.00 for students and \u00a36.00 for others.\nAdam Harrington.\n\n"

Mr W.D. Evans, chief engineer\nof College Estates, reported that the\ndamage was fairly superficial and would\nprobably take about a month to repair.\nMr Evans reported that copper flashing\nfrom the roof of the physics department\nwas ripped off and landed in Prince\nConsort road. It did not hit anything,\nthough the road was closed for two hours\nas a precaution.\nA metal chimney on the Mines building\nwas cut down as the chimney started to\nlook dangerous. Windows were blown out\nin various places including Civil\nEngineering and in Ayrton road. Stones\nfrom the roofs of buildings were brought\ndown, though no casualties have been\nreported.\nA plank from the scaffolding of\nworkmen on the north side of Princes\nGardens crashed through the roof and\nwindscreen of a student's car, virtually\ndes toying it. Falling slates damaged cars\nin Callendar road, smashing windscreens\nand bodywork.\nA sizeable lump of lead measuring about\nsix foot by two foot was blown from the\nroof of the union building and landed\nbehind the building. It is now in the\npo session of Dave Williams in the Union\noffice.\nThe storm has had gusts of up to110 mph, and was described as hurricane force\n12. It swept the south of the country,\npeaking in severity in the mid-afternoon.\nIt was responsible for the deaths of more\nthan twenty people and caused travel chaos\nover a wide area, closing virtually all\npublic transport networks and severely\naffecting roads.\nMr Evans said that the damage was\nnowhere near as severe as from the great\nstorm of October '87, though\nmeteorologists have described it as\n'similar' in strength to the great storm at\ntimes.\nv flying, wind-powered builder's plank successfully tackles a1956 Triumph Herald.\nImperial industrial dispute?\nIndustrial relations are set for a stormy\npatch at IC following the college's decision to make the post of 'Head\nGardener' redundant. This would leave the\npresent head gardener, Mr Christopher\nSpeirs, who is 50, out of work and\nhomeless. Mr Spiers currently rents\naccommodation from the college.\nThe National Union of Public\nEmployees (NUPE) have made a strong\nprotest to the college authorities\nconcerning the action, claiming it was an\n'arbitrary decision' and that they find it\n'totally unacceptable'.\nThe college maintain that they need to\ncut costs. Mr Robert Letham, senior\npersonnel officer of the college, was\nunwilling to discuss individual cases,\nthough he said 'the MPG( management\nplanning group) had decided that it was\nin the managerial interest that all\ngardening in the college was to be done\nby contractors.'\nNUPE claim that the college had a duty\nto consult with the unions before any such\naction and that they failed to do this. Mr\nBrian Murphy, the NUPE representative\nat IC, said he suspects that the college have\nbeen slowly contracting out such work to\nprivate employers over three years without\nconsultation so that by this time they could\nbe seen as unreasonable not to complete\nthe transition.\nMr Letham bore this out by saying that\nas over 90% of gardening work was done\nby private contractors they 'couldn't go\nback' by not doing the same to the final\ncollege funded gardening post. He stressed\nthat there was a recommendation to\nconsult with the unions, but no\nrequirement to do so.\nMr Michael Jackson, the Area Officer\nof NUPE, said in a letter to the Rector,\nSir Eric Ash, that the 'majority of Chris\nSpeirs work still exists and he still carries\nit out to the satisfaction of his managers\nand the college', though he concedes that\nthe job would take on a more supervisory\nrole. He informed the Rector that, in his\nview, because the job is not a highly paid\none the financial benefits to the college of\nhiring out the work and sacking Mr Speirs\nwould be minimal. 'We are always\nprepared to discuss the implications of the\nfinancial position of Imperial and the ways\nin which savings can be made. However,\nwe would draw the line emphatically at\nenforced redundancies to achieve this,' he\nsaid in a letter earlier this month. Mr\nJackson declined to speak directly to Felix\non any of these matters.\nMr Murphy said that three years ago Sir\nAsh explained that the college was \u00a33\nmillion in the red, but denied the\npossibility of private contractors being\nbrought in. A recent report in the Times\nHigher Education supplement put Imperial\nCollege in the top eight colleges in London\nin most serious financial trouble, with an\nexpected debt of \u00a38 million by 1992/3.\nThis is putting severe pressure on college\nadministration to cut costs.\nN UP E accuse the college of\n'blackmailing' Mr Speirs to 'go quietly'\nby offering a more generous financial\narrangement if he did so. They question\nwhether the college will contract out other\nservices in the future, like catering and\ncleaning. IC NUPE have managed to raise\n231 signatures on a petition registering\ndiss approval of the college's proposed\naction.\nImperial College Union have decided to\nremain at a distance from the dispute, after\na discussion in the Union's Executive\nCommittee.\n\n"

    "content": "FeliX The Rector's letter\nBefore replying to Sir Eric's letter, I feel I should point\nout that Mr Shanley's letter was received before the\nRector's.I should also like to apologise for referring\nto Dr Russ Clark as Mr Clark in last week's issue and\nfor incorrectly titling Sir Eric as Sir Ash.\nNow for the shock. I agree with the Rector;\ncompanies should contribute a lot more towards the\nrunning of the careers centre. The amount raised at\npresent is pitiful compared to the vast recruitment\nbudgets employed by industry. It is sad, therefore,\nthat a concerted effort has not been made by the\ncollege to obtain such funding. The College's Management and Planning Group should have\nconsidered this option before imposing the cuts on the\ncareers centre. With postgraduates running the\nlibrary, the chances of attracting revenue will fall.\nWouldn't it have been wise to sell the centre at its\npeak rather than run it down and try to market it as\nan 'old b anger?' At the risk of repeating myself, postgraduates\ncannot do the work of the present Information Officer.\nIn general, postgraduates have as much knowledge\nof the job market as undergraduates. How can they\nbe expected to help and advise people in their search\nfor a job when many of them have not left academia?\nTo aspire to the American careers centres is to ignore\nthe huge difference in our educational systems. A first\ndegree in America will often span five years, with the\nstudent working for a large part of the extra time, in\norder to pay their way. At last, Sir Eric has found an\nadvantage to Britain's American-style loans system-we will receive much older and more experienced\npostgraduates, who will be able to run our careers\ncentre.\nIf you are a postgraduate, prepared to work for \u00a34\nan hour every day from 11am to 4pm, I would be\ninterested to hear from you. You are just the sort of\npostgraduate the careers centre will need-dedicated,\nreliable and underpaid; and likely to fail your PhD as\nwell, I should say.\nOn the question of my denigrating the departmental\ncareers services, I would like to know where half of\nthem are (I have never seen any publicity for them)\nand how capable they are of coping with the 100 or\nso enquiries the Central Careers service deals with\neach day. I am sure these services play their part in\nguiding students into their chosen careers, but they\nare not sufficient for everyone's needs.\nAs for my comments on the courses at IC, my point\nremains; IC kills imagination in all but a few students.\nIf the Rector believes that what students say to him\nis representative and that the Union's Alternative\nProspectus (AP) is an honest opinion he is very naive.\nThe AP is written by Departmental Representatives\nunder the watchful eyes of their Senior Tutors. The\nlast time the truth was told, in a supplement to the\nAP two years ago, the departments slammed the\npublication and the College practically refused to help\nwith its distribution. Needless to say, the supplement\nwas reprinted after consultation with departmental\nsenior tutors. How can such a publication be honest\nwhen it is written by a student, who is still studying\nfor their degree?\nSabbatical Elections\nYes, it's almost that time of year again! Anybody\nthinking of standing should see me as soon as possible\nto discuss the printing of their publicity. If you require\ncoloured inks or paper, I will have to order them in\nadvance. I have left a space in the print schedule\nduring February to allow for election publicity. I apologise to anybody who may be inconvenienced by\nthis but I have to be able to print everyone's publicity\nby the papers down deadline.

    "content": "Storm Damage\nContractors cordon off the road outside the Physics department as debris flies from the roof.\nMontpelier\nwashed up\nThere is anger in Montpelier hall after large damp\npatches appeared in rooms behind the showers after\na major refurbishment just over a year ago.\nDr Kevin O 'Connor, warden of Montpelier hall,\nrecounted the history of the damp patch, which started\nthree years ago when Dr O 'Connor notified Mr Peter\nHallworth, managing surveyor of residences, about\nsuspected dampness in rooms near the showers. Dr\nO 'Connor said that Mr Hallworth denied that it was\ndamp, but one and a half years later a ceiling collapsed\nin one of these damp rooms, narrowly missing the\nac cup ant. Action was taken, and the showers were totally\nredone, including re grouting and re plumbing. Dr\nO 'Connor claims he asked Mr Hallworth why the\noriginal plumbers were not called to account for their\nwork, assuming that they ought to repair the damage\nthey had caused. Dr O 'Connor said he was intensely\nirritated by Mr Hallworth's response. 'He said \"thats\ntotally unreasonable\u2014 in the real world it does not\nwork like that\". I 've got more qualifications, more\npeople working under me, than Peter Hallworth\u2014\nwho is he to say I'm not in the real world?' said Dr\nO' Connor.\nTwo weeks ago large damp patches appeared in\nrooms adjacent to the showers, and again the warden\nof Montpelier informed Mr Hallworth and asked for\nthe contractors to make good their repairs. Dr\nO 'Connor said that Mr Hallworth discounted the\npossibility of getting contractors to fix a year old\nproblem that they themselves created.\nMr Hallworth was unavailable for comment on the\naffair, though Mr Jo Dines, the assistant clerk of\nworks, denied that there was anything out of order.\nHe said that the contractors, 'Gaydales' would do the\nrepairs, under guarantee. He offered no complaint\nf their past work.\nNUS voted\nout\nA motion at last night's Union General Meeting has\nresolved not to hold a referendum on re affiliation to\nthe National Union of Students (NUS). The motion,\nproposed by JD Griffiths, found the NUS to be an\nundemocratic organisation. Until members are\nallowed to opt-in and opt-out, the motion continues,\nICU will not consider are affiliation vote.\nQuorum was successfully called upon the meeting\nas it reached a motion on travel costs when\nrepresenting ICU. The proposer of the motion, Mr\nJ F Lucas now hopes to call an emergency general\nmeeting to discuss the motion. Mr Lucas will require\n120 signatures on a petition to the President in order\nto call the meeting. His motion resolves to pay 100%\nof IC students' travel costs when representing the\nUnion inside London and 60% when outside the\nLondon area. Mr Lucas feels that high travel costs\nare currently di sua ding students from representing\nICU in sports.\nThe meeting closed, unable to discuss motions on\nsupport of the Ambulance workers and support of a NUS loans demonstration and a motion calling for\na campaign for the College's Careers centre.\nAmnesty\ntalk\nTwo students who visited the Thailand/Burma border\nlast year will be giving a talk on the human rights\nissues of the area on Tuesday 6th February at 5:45\nin the Brown Committee room on the top floor of the\nUnion building.\nThe IC Amnesty group have organised the talk, and\nthere will be a connected slide show.\nSee no evil\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, visited the Careers advisory\nservice last Monday following the article on the\nservice in last week's Felix. Dr Russ Clark, head of\nthe CAS, said that there was 'a useful exchange of\nviews'. He added that he 'would like to think that\nhe (the Rector) was impressed with the layout and\nefficiency with which we operate'. Dr Clark thought\nthat the Rector would still be committed to the use\nof postgraduates, but would reconsider the\nappointment of a careers librarian if put through the\nManagement Planning Group.\nDr Clark finished by saying that he was pleased\nthat the Rector took notice and hoped that 'the\nprofessional it y of the careers librarian would be\nrecognized'.\nMoney go\nround\nThis month Professor R.W. H. Sargent of Chemical\nEngineering has won the much coveted Research\nGrant Stakes trophy. He has been awarded \u00a3446,760\nover three years from Prosys Technology Ltd for\n'Development of SPEEDUP'.\nThe 'Free market economy Booby Prize' is\npresented this month to the Medical Research Council\n(MRC), who have given \u00a32881 over one-and-a half\nmonths to Professor R.R.

Together with any students who wish to support\nthe ambulance crews, they are to meet by the Post\noffice on Exhibition road at noon on Tuesday January\n30th. Students and staff will be asked to stand in protest\nfor 15 minutes during their lunch hour. An MSF\nsource said the action was not a stoppage. Some Heads\nof Departments were expected to attend, he added.\nHumanities\nlecture\nThe Humanities department have arranged a lunch\nhour lecture on the subject 'How should science\njo una lists write about science ?'\nIt will be given by Dr Bernard Dixon, formerly the\neditor of the 'New Scientist', and will take place at\n1:15 on Tuesday 30th January in the Read theatre,\nlevel 5 of Sherfield.\nSPORTS RESULTS\nUAU RUGBY\nIC\u201412 Swansea\u201431\nDurham 1\n1\n\u2014\n3\n2 IC II\u20140\nIC III\u20147 Exeter III\u201420\nUAU MENS HOCKEY\nIC II\u20141 Nottingham II\u20143\nIC III\u20142 Swansea III\u20141\nFriendly\nIC IV\u20140 Charing X II\u20144\nLADIES HOCKEY\nLondon Hospital\u20142 IC II\u20140\nFOOTBALL\nIC IV-4 IC V \u20140\nIC VI\u20140 UC VII-2\nPage 16\n\n"

    "content": "Fixx\u2014Terence Blacker\nBook\nJonathan Peter Fixx is a self made man, the idealised\nproduct of the Thatcher decade, although he would\nhave become the same man without our most\ninfamous leader. He graduated from the school of hard\nknocks with honours, learning that the most\nfinancially profitable solution to a is always the best\nand that money comes before all else.\nLife started hard for Fixx, his father, a war hero, dies\nat an early age. His mother left alone to care for her\nonly child employs a nanny, Aunty Bar-Bar, to look\nafter him. From here on his life is a roller-coaster of\nups and downs, both financially and personally.\nAfter the removal of the revolting Aunty Bar-Bar,\nwho sexually abuses him in the bath and in his own\nbed, he is sent to a boarding school where he becomes\na teenage pimp. He then moves on to become a small\ntime gangster and extortionist in some of the less\nrespectable districts of London.\nMoving into business he manages to make lots of\nmoney in various less than moral, if not illegal\nmethods. Some of the companies that he owns\nproduce what can only be described as less than\nreputable products, ranging from a single dose a month contraceptive pill that causes cancer to germ\nand viral warfare weapons.\nThen deciding to settle down he sets out to find a wife of good breeding with a country estate and a castle for him to play in. Having eventually persuaded\nher father, he marries a young lady but still feels the\nnecessity to spread himself around, giving other\nwomen the pleasure of his company, normally in their\nbedroom's. Meanwhile, the Inland Revenue and VAT men have\ndiscovered the creative accounting that has helped\nhim become so wealthy so quickly. As a bribe he is\noffered the chance to work for Queen and country,\nin return the criminal proceedings would be stopped.\nThe work involves travelling around the world picking\nup and dropping packages and information, in short\nhe is to become a spy.\nWith a story line like this you would expect a fast\nmoving hilarious book that would keep you on your\ntoes throughout. In places it is like this, indeed it is\nan enjoyable read for the most part. There are one or\ntwo things however that I found rather distressing\nabout the book.\nCall me old fashioned, or a winging boring\nconservative (with a small 'c') but the idea of making\na cheap laugh out of child abuse seems to be as low\nas you can get. References to 'Mr Doodah' and calling\nsex 'going to Bedfordshire' are not the sort of thing\nthat a book should be based on or mention at all.\nIt is not that the subject should be brushed under\nthe carpet, it should be treated with tact and respect.\nAdded to this is one of the most offensive things I have read in a book for a long time. As I have said\nhe at one stage owns a company that produces a viral\nwarfare weapon. One of these is a virus that\nsupposedly attacks only homosexual men.\nUnfortunately during a test trial the virus escapes and\nstarts infecting most of Africa. Later on in the book,\nas he sums up his life he says that he was responsible\nfor introducing AIDS into the world. The insinuation\nthat AIDS is only a homosexual problem is not only\nwrong but very offensive to me and I expect the\nmajority of the homosexual community.\nAfter the fuss that 'Satanic Verses' produced I feel\nthat something should be done to stop offence being\ncaused by such obvious lies.\nLeaving that aside; what about the literary quality\nof the book? For the most part it is quite average in\nits quality, with none of the characters particularly\nwell done, although this might be too much to expect.\nFixx himself seems to spent most of his time in self-glorification, having very little time for other people,\neven his wife, and especially his mother.\nThere are various other sub-plots that add interest,\nsuch as his mother starting a female masturbation\nclass and his wife's attempts to start an art gallery.\nIn a book of this type there in never room for much\nartistic licence and so there is not very much in the\nway of an atmosphere created or very much literary\nskill.\nReading the review comments on the back of the\nbook I find it hard to understand why such respectable\npublications as The Guardian would make such\ncomments as 'overwhelmingly comic'\nOverall I find it hard to recommend this book to\nanyone, although I expect that some people would not\nfind it offensive I think the majority of sane 'normal'\npeople would. Nobody should have to sink to these\ndepths to try and produce a supposed humours book\nand I will certainly think very carefully before buying\nany books by this aut hour in the future.\nIan Hodge,\nIn Pursuit of the English\nTheatre\nIn Pursuit of the English is a sympathetic satire of the\neccentricities of English life, seen through the eyes\nof a young woman, recently arrived from Southern\nAfrica, where she has lived all her life, to find her roots\nin England.\nDoris has never considered herself as anything but\nEnglish and is surprised to find that Londoners look\nupon her as foreign. She soon discovers for herself\nthat being English abroad is rather different from being\nEnglish in England.\nAfter a bewildering time trying to find cheap, good\naccommodation, she is befriended by Rose, an\nEastender who takes her back to where she lives and\nwhere her friend, Flo, has a room to let. Flo lives with\nher second husband Dan, and her son by her first\nmarriage, Jack. It is not exactly a happy household-Dan makes Jack work very hard and gives him no\nmoney, Jack resents Dan because he is not his real\nfather, Flo has divided loyalties between her husband\nand her son. Rose is in love with Dan's brother but\nthey aren't getting on very well because she won't give him what he wants. This is the situation in which\nDoris finds herself, as friend and confidante of Rose\nand to a lesser degree of Flo and Miss Privet (a prostitute who is also renting a room in the house),\na situation which can become awkward at times.\nAlthough nominally about Doris trying to fathom the\nstrange ways of Londoners, the majority of the play\nis about the problems of those in the house, especially\nRose.\nSet in post-war Britain, 1949, shortages are still\nvery real and Flo and Dan are forever waiting for the\nwar damage, 'due any day'. Flo would scrounge\nanything given half a chance and tries to take\nadvantage of the kindly Doris, until Rose puts her foot\ndown. Cigarettes and nylons are still very much\nluxuries and Rose cannot believe the kind of clothes\nDoris has and takes for granted.\nThe play does not avoid delicate issues such as\nprostitution-it is open about such things, but never\nvulgar and deals with such subjects sympathetically.\nIt also explores the mixed feelings people had about\nthe end of the war. Of course everyone wanted the\nfighting to end but with the cessation of hostilities\ncame the end of the spirit that united the Birtish people\nin a common cause. During the war a working class\nperson could talk to someone from the middle class\nand each would discover the other 'not so bad when\nyou got to know them-not their fault poor sods'. A woman could share a blanket in an air raid shelter with\na man and 'no one would think the worst'. But once\nthe war was over life resumed as before and all this\nwas lost. In common with many people Rose misses\nthis and almost wishes there were still a war 'Not the\nkilling of course, but then I didn't really know anybody\nwho was killed', 'People liked each other'.\nThe staging of the play is unusual in several\nrespects. The scenes are divided by blackouts and\nshort musical/dance interludes. There is little scenery\nbut this is very cleverly compensated for by mime; for\ninstance when Doris travels on a bus; or through the\nwords of characters: two removal men for instance\ndescribe the decor of a room Doris is looking to rent.\nIngeniously structured asides provide an insight in\nDoris's mind. They are said while other characters are\ntalking to her and they appear to take only a split\nsecond.\nThis is an innovative, thought-provoking play, not\nto mention an amusing evening's entertainment, full\nof thoroughly English humour and I definitely\nrecommend it.\nIn Pursuit of the English is on at the Lyric Theatre,\nnear Hammersmith tube station, King Street, London\nW6. Tickets for this studio production are \u00a36. Ring\nthe box office on 01-741 2311 for information on\nconcessionary tickets. The play runs until February\n24.\nJ. L.W. Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "Arts Week at IC\nIn just over a week's time, Imperial College plays host\nto what is hoped will become an annual event -The\nArts Week. Running between 5 and 11 February, The\nArts Week is a celebration of Christian involvement\nin the arts and consists of live events such as music\nand drama, an exhibition and a service. Here we\nreview the week's happenings, whilst below we talk\nto Si Bichara, Co-or d in at or of The Arts Week.\nThe main thrust of the week is in the live arena.\nEvery lunchtime from 12.30 to 1.30 or 2.30\n(depending on the day), things will be happening in\nthe Union Lounge (in through the doors of the Union,\nsharp left).\nOn Monday, singer guitarist Keith Thompson is\nperforming. Keith's tuneful voice and soulful lyrics\nmake this event one not to be missed-especially as\nhe is doing one of his rare solo performances.\nFor Tuesday, we have been lucky to get Fat &\nFrantic, one of the hottest bands playing on the circuit,\nwith a debut single just starting to climb the charts.\nThis'll be your only chance to hear them in London\nwithout paying the prices demanded by the Astoria\nor Dominion! They'll be going on with Steven Turner,\na poet of no little note. Don't be put off by the word\n'poet' as the combination exceeds the sum of both\nparts.\nOn Wednesday, Fresh Claim appear, playing their\nown brand of extremely loud funk rock, together with\nGriff Pilchard, a veteran of the Greenbelt festival, and\none of the craziest, funniest people this reviewer has\never seen. He'll hopefully be playing his classic 'I'm a frog and I like mud' song. This should be well worth\nattending-even if just to laugh at Griff.\nThursday sees a more relaxed and unusual\nschedule, featuring Sandra the clown (yes, clown!)\nand The Imploding Hampsters, who describe\nthemselves as 'a red-hot jazz trio'. They're a relatively\nnew combo who look set for big things in the future.\nFinally, Friday hosts one of the highlights of the\nweek-ff W/ 'ng Lights Theatre Company performing\ntheir acclaimed revue 'World Exclusive'. Riding Lights\nhave performed all over the UK, and their credits\ninclude the Edinburgh Festival and numerous\ntelevision appearances. It has been a major coup to\nget them to perform at IC.\nThe events have been designed to allow you to pick\nup lunch at the Union snack bar, then go across to the\nLounge and watch some first class entertainment\nwhilst eating. All the above performances are free \u2014\ncourtesy of IC Union and their sponsors, and are\nguaranteed to spice up your lunchtime.\nDuring the week, and the week before, a fine art\nexhibition will be taking place in the Sherfield Ante\nRoom, bringing together many contrasting styles of\nwork. The exhibition is free and will be accompanied\nfrom time to time by musicians. Drop in on your way\nto the refectory!\nOn Sunday there's a closing service to round off the\nweek and bring the threads of different arts together.\n10.00am in the Sherfield Ante Room.\nWatch out for the posters, giving up to date news\nabout what's happening, and for The Arts Week\nGraffiti board in the JCR to allow you to give us your\nreactions to this new event.\nThe interview\u2014sort of\nFelix: So, can I ask you first why you think Imperial\nneeds an arts week?\nSi: Well, why not? I think it'll give us all the\nchance to go to some very good gigs-for free, if\nnothing else! I know that I 've got a little bored\nwith sitting around the JCR at lunchtimes over\nthree years, and these events will provide some\ndiversion.\nFelix: Is that where the idea for the week came from?\nSi: No...well...not really. That's how I got\ninvolved, but really it's more a chance to show off\nwhat we can do.\nFelix: By we you mean...?\nSi: Christians in general. I think what we're trying\nto say is that we're not just boring farts who hang\naround with long faces all the time, which is an\nimage people probably have. We're trying to say\nthat we can have fun, and also that we can\nproduce high quality music and so on, which is\ncapable of competing with the best in the world.\nFelix: So will this be a religious week?\nSi: Not so's you'd notice. All the performers are\nChristians, sure, but this week isn't about\nspeakers or preachers or people trying to shove\nGod down your throat. Just good art, music,\npoetry, clowning, and so on.\nFelix: Can we talk about the acts you've got lined up\nfor us?\nSi: Sure. We made a decision in the early stages\nof planning that we'd go for the best, irrespective\nof cost, and if we had to cut down on the number\nof events as a result, so be it.\nFelk: So you think you've got the best?\nSi: I think we've got some first class people. Fat\n& Frantic are a very good band-they'll be big in\n1990. Riding Lights are real pros -1' ve seen them\nPage 8\nperform before and it really is an experience not\nto be missed. I mean, everything we've got is\nreally good, but those two really stand out. And\nGriff.\nFelix: Who?\nSi: Griff Pilchard. He's this n utter who's coming\non Wednesday. I think he's hilarious, but you\neither like him or don't. Definitely worth sampling,\nthough.\nFelix: It's all free, isn't it?\nYup. Union Lounge, lunchtimes, 5th9 th. there.\nFelix: What about this 'graffiti board'?\nBe\nSi: Well it's basically just a big white sheet of\nhard board stuck up in the JCR for people to write\ncomments on about The Arts Week. OK, some\nidiot is bound to write 'Fuck Off, or a similar\nwitticism, but that's inevitable, really. At least it\ngives pe o pea chance to feed back to us.\nFelix: And fine art In the Ante Room?\nSi: Yes. Again, all week. Some good painters are\nexhibiting-art aficionados take note! And we're\nhoping to have some musicians in there on the\nodd lunchtime to accompany the perusal of the\npaintings with a little light music.\nFelix: Sounds terribly civilised.\nSi: Terribly.\n\n"

    "content": "Physicists in Japan have discovered a gyroscope effect which could force a rethink on\nthe current theories of mechanics. Stalled from publishing, their results could be as\nsignificant or as unfounded'as 'cold fusion'.\nGyromania\nThe g ryo scope is a curious beast. When spinning it\nstands upright effortlessly, as if by magic. It will rotate\nhorizontally about an anchor at one end. Dancing on\none foot it glides around as if to music.\nIn fact, all its mystical properties are a consequence\nof the conservation of angular momentum law. This\nmerely says that the angular momentum remains\nconstant unless acted upon by a torque (a twisting\nforce). The angular momentum is the momentum\nassociated with the rotation of a body. For the\ngyroscope it is de cri bed by a vector with magnitude\nproportional to the several characteristics of the rotor.\nIts direction is that of the spin axis.\nIn order to change the direction of the gyroscope\na force must act on the rotor, which effectively alters\nthe plane or direction of the rotor's spin. The action\nof gravity when a gyroscope is fixed off vertical at one\nend of its axle, means that it will 'p recess': the whole\ngyroscope will rotate in a circle around this point of\nattachment. This is because the force due to gravity\nproduces a torque around the pivot, which causes the\ngyroscope's angular momentum vector to rotate in\nthis manner, rather than fall downwards.\nThis outlines why gyroscopes behave as they do\nand clearly is not a detailed explanation. What it is\nintended to show is that gyroscopes are well\nunderstood. They are an integral part of kinematics\nnot a separate entity, All their properties are described\nby the laws of linear and rotational mechanics.\nThis said, machines using gyroscopes make\nappearances in the headlines at surprisingly regular\nintervals. Devices have been designed which claim to\nhover above the ground without energy loss or will\nspeed you to Australia in a few hours. They are often\npatented and bought out by large companies\npresumably in the hope that one day they will pay off.\nAccording to the present theory of mechanics, there\nis no change in weight for a normal g ryo scope between its spinning and stationary states. If the\ngyroscope is spinning on a vertical axis its motion does\nnot produce a force which would contribute in any\nway to the apparent weight of the gyroscope.\nLast month however an article was published in the\nwell respected Physical Review Letters (vol 63, No 25\npp2701) contradicting this. The paper was written by\ntwo Japanese physicists H Hayasaka and S Takeuchi.\nThey claim that a weight reduction can be observed\nbetween ag ryo scope spinning in one direction and\none spinning in the opposite direction or stationary.\n-This is bizarre.\nThe experimental arrangement consisted of a sensitive chemical balance with standard weights and\na small electric gyroscope (with three alternative\nrotors of different masses and made from aluminium,\nbrass and silicon-steel). The apparatus was\ncontained in a vacuum vessel.\nAfter accelerating the gyroscope up to speed the\npower from the AC motor was cut so that the\ngyroscope 'free-wheeled.' The rotation speed was\ndetermined using astro bosco pic tachometer. The\nweight was measured 10 times for a range of rotation\nfrequencies from 3000-13000 rpm in 1000 rpm\nsteps. On alternate steps the rotors were turned\nupside down.\nIn all cases the weight of the gyroscope decreased\nlinearly with frequency when the gyroscope was\nspinning in an anticlockwise direction as viewed from\nabove. The weight changes were between 2mg to\n11mg for the 175g rotor with the sensitivity of the\nbalance being a claimed 0.3mg. The results from the\ngyroscope spinning in the other direction or stationary\nshow no weight change whatsoever at any of the\nf re que n ces of rotation. The data is remarkably well\ncorrelated.\nExtensive cross referencing was said to agree with\nthe results. The apparatus was run in a magnetically\nisolated cylinder where the magnetic field was 1 /100\nof the strength of the external environmental magnetic\nfield. This again is claimed not to affect the results.\nThe lift available on the g ryo scope due to the fluid\neffect of air was found to be 260mg. However the\npressure during the experiment was between 104\nand\n107\ntimes lower than this. However the most\nconvincing argument is that the lift would be produced\nin either direction of spin. The experiment was\nrepeated on different days and with different\norientations (North, South, East, West) and again no\ndifferent conclusions were made.\nThe whole experiment is convincing and at the\nsame time totally inexplicable. The most fundamental\nstatement is that if this effect is real then nature is\nsensitive to the 'handedness' of things; forces applied\nto bodies with right handed properties have a different\neffect to those acting on left handed ones. The force\nwe seem to see is effectively a repulsive 'anti-gravity.'\nIf such a force turned out to exist the effect on physics\nwould be profound. We now await further\nexperiments and confirmation or contradiction.\nThis\nBy Simon Haslam\nWeek\n\u2022 Solvent resistant plastic has been made by a new\ntechnique whereby the surface of polyethylene\n(polythene) is coated with poly flu oro ethylene. The\nlayer is deposited by either blowing the polythene into\nshape using a mixture of fluorine and nitrogen gas or\nby treating the products with the gas afterwards. This\nprovides a tough outer layer which makes the plastic\nvery res ili ant to common solvents such as turpentine,\noil and petrol. The latter property means that car\nmanufacturers such as Volkswagon, BMW and\nPeugeot are using the new super-polythene for petrol\ntanks. Plastic tanks are less likely to rupture in the\nevent of a crash but ordinary polythene allows fuel\nto slowly escape through the walls. The most\nawkward problem however is that fluorine is the most\nreactive of all the elements and is obviously highly\ntoxic. Mixing it with nitrogen makes it more\nmanageable and there are now several companies\nspecialising in producing the new plastic.\n\u2022 A lost glove and camera were spotted just before\nbeing burnt up on re-entry into the atmosphere. They\nhad been dropped by astronauts twenty years ago and\nare among 20,000 objects item is ed by the radar\ntracking station, RAF Fylingdales, in order to prevent\nthem being misinterpreted as early warning of a nuclear attack.\n\u2022 The American Superconducting Super Collider\n(SSC) is to be the biggest particle accelerator in the\nworld (and will be sited in Texas, of course). Some\nmembers of Congress now believe the 20 GeV proton-proton collider will need twice the $5.9 billion formally\ndeclared as its final price.\nThis follows what has appeared to be the almost\nweekly increase in the estimated cost of the proposed\nhigh energy physics machine. Instabilities in the\nsuperconducting magnets are likely to require beam\naperture widening and possibly more focussing\nmagnets which would increase the circumference of\nthe ring by 2km to 87km. Computer modelling is also\nsuggesting that the problems are highlighted at low\nenergies and so higher energy proton injection is being\nproposed (at an additional cost of $288 million). At\nthis rate the SSC may well cost more to build than\nthe Channel Tunnel.\n\u2022 NASA's latest shuttle mission (involving\nColumbia) has recovered a satellite which had been\nin orbit for nearly six years. This will provide scientists\nwith useful data on how spacecraft survive though\nlong periods in space from its 57 experiments\ncontained on board. The satellite was due to be in orbit\nfor no more than ten months but its retrieval was held\nup by the Challenger disaster.\n\u2022 Irradiated food is the subject of a recent House\nof Lords Select Committee report which says that the\n'overwhelming weight of evidence is that irradiation\nof food on the limited basis proposed by the\ncommission is safe'. The suggested foot stuffs, which\nincluding shrimps and 'poultry meat', appear to be\nchosen arbitrarily but the document states 'such a limitation will enable the effects of irradiation to be\nmonitored and suitable regulatory controls developed'.\n\u2022 'Chaos Reigns'.
