    "content": "2 FELIX THE RECTOR'S SP BBC H. The Rector in his speech at the Commemoration\nDay celebrations in the Albert Hall confined himself almost entirely to a factual review of the\nprogress that has so far been made in the expansion\nprogramme for the college. He began \"by quoting a government estimate that 85,000 more scientist and\nengineers would be required during the next 10 years\nand went on to show that I.C. is doing its full\nshare in trying to achieve this increase.\nVITAL STATISTICS\nDuring the 3 years 1953 to 1956 the number\nof students has increased from 1650 to 2240, an\nincrease of 36/0. A corresponding increase of 33;i> has taken place in the number of staff, mainly\nby the creation of 5 new chairs in the departments of Aeronautical Structures, Instrument Technology, Nuclear Power, Parasitology and Soil Mechanics.\nINCREASED ACCOMODATION\nThe Reotor stated that the total floor spa oe had. been increased by 2Cf~> by the ^sd&it i of fi of an\nextra floor to Mines and the Goldsmith's extension\nbud il dings, and the erection of the new building\nfor Aeronautics and Chemical Engineering. This\nbuilding 13 rapidly ne-o ing completion, and the\nAeronautics department is already in occupation.\nThe Hector reaffirmed the authorities' intention\nto increase residential ac como dati on as soon as\npossible, and reminded his audience that the College had recently acquired a site in Princes Gardens, and hopes to have ac como dati on for another\n450 students ready in two years time.\nThe first quarter of the expansion programme\ncould now be considered complete, and the staff\nand students were thanked for their co-operation\nunder difficult conditions.\nThe Rector concluded by outlining the iraa edi ate expansion programme, and he felt that with\nthe aid of the government, University, and all others concerned it should be possible to achieve\nall the objectives.\nCH PRC H SERVICE The Rector, Deans, graduates, visitors and\nstudents assembled in Holy Trinity Church for\nworship, before proceeding to the Albert Hall. The preacher was the V. Rev.Dr. A.C. Don, Dean\nof Westminster.\nThe gist of Dr. Don's sermon was as follows:\n-The climate of opinion is changing so that,\nwhereas Huxley and other great scientists of the\n19th. Century had to fight for /hat they believed\nto be true, the Church has learnt much from\nScience and there is now.an attitude of mutual\nrespect. However, faith is no optional extra.\nTo worship God as Lord only of the Church, and\nnot also of Creation, and therefore of History,\nPolitics, Science, is to court idolatry. The\nscientist must also answer the question:\"What\nthink Ye of Christ ?\"\nSIR JOHN COCK CROFT'S SPEECH. THE FUTURE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY\nThis years Special Visitor for Commemoration Day was Sir John Cockcroft, K..C.B., F.R.S., Director of the Atomic Energy,\nResearch Establishment, Harwell, who was\nintroduced by the Chairman of the Governing:\nBody, The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Falmouth.\nSir John, in his opening remarks, outlined\nthe basic research that had been carried out\non nuclear physics a quarter of a century ago\nand stated that the rapid development going\non at the present was only possible because\nof this work. He prophesied that twenty years\nhence the greater part of all energy in this\ncountry would be provided from atomic sources\nand considered that I.C. had an important\npart to play in this development^' by the\nrecent creation of the Chair of Nuclear Power.\nWeed Killer Sways U.S. Presidential Election.\nSir John pointed out that the advent of the\natomic era heralded more automation but he\nstressed that this was merely a continuation\nof something that had been going on since the\nIndustrial Revolution and was not new. He\nstated that automation would make a lot of\nunskilled workers redundant but that many more\ntechnicians would be required to operate the\nnew machines. Sir John was emphatic that it was possible to train unskilled workers to\nbecome semi-skilled technicians, thus giving\nthem a greater interest in their work. He\nagreed,however,that the development of technology would produce many new problems,and\ninstanced the increased crop yields in the\nU.S. due to the use of new weed killers, which\nhad given rise to problems that were a major\nissue in the present Presidential Elections.\nNeed for Creative Designers.\nSir John outlined what he considered were\nthe ingredients for technical success. These\nwere firstly a basic new idea or synthesis of\nideas, secondly, adequate facilities and funds\nfor the development of that idea, and thirdly a team of technologists capable of designing\nand streamlining the product for maximum\nproduction. At present we were most in need\nof technologists and compared with the United\nStates and Russia we were outnumbered by 10\nto 1 and 20 to 1 respectively,\nSir John ended by appealing for a more\nbroadly based education for technologists\nwith more time given in the curriculum for\nthe humanities. The greatest need in Industry today was not for men who had specialised\nin a particular narrow field of technology\nbut for those who had a bro ard scientific education and were able to adapt themselves\nto the continually changing needs of new\ndevelopment. He thought that Imperial\nCollege had an important part to play in providing this form of education and advocated the provision of residential facilities for all students as a necessary part of their education.\n\n"

A group\noutside transferred it through the wicket gate\ninto a waiting car which vanished into the night.\nThose Miners remaining after the coup ret i red without much trouble to the \"Queen's\", only\nto be attacked by angry Guildsmen in Queen's Gate Terrace after closing time - Rutter lost his trousers in public.\nThe Spanner attended the Mines Union Meeting on Tuesday. When the meeting ended at 1.56\nit was suspended from second floor windows in the R.S. M. entrance arch. Meanwhile Guilds had\nmassed in Room 17, and, Just after 2 p.m., came round to the front Of Mines. They got their beloved match wood back after 20 minutes of hard\nscrapping. Several trousers changed hands, and\nthe appearance of a police car brought matters\nto a close. We hope to print additional details\nand a photograph in the next issue.\nCOMING EVENT!

BR AM LEY\nWriting an editorial is a very difficult job.\nWe were going to write about the standard of\nmanners in I.C. we actually saw the Chairman\nof the S. C.C.( of all people) comb his hair when\nstanding in the middle of Claridges' Ballroom J We were intending to praise Dr. Sparkes despite\nhis unkind remarks about \"distortions which\nappear in FELIX\" at the Union Meeting. We were\nto point out that the staff orations on Commem.\nDay might have been as audible as Andy Levine's had they taken the trouble to rehearse as he\ndid. The production manager tells us that we\nhave no room for all this in this issue.\nI.C. UNION MEETING The Extraordinary Union Meeting was actually held In the Concert Hall, much to most peoples\nsurprise. The Hall had a completed flooring which was tastefully covered with green canvas.\nThe two main items were a dissertation from\nthe Planning Officer, Dr. Sparkes, and the\npresentation of the House Committee's Report.\nThe latter item is reported below.\nDr Sparkes was introduced by K itch who said\nthat we should now hear 'straight from the\nhorse's mouth' of the progress of the building.\nDr Sparkes said that Mr Kitchener was a rude\nman and he had never been called a horse before\nIn front of so many swine. Dr Sparkes made\nno promises and he defended the contractors.\nIn 17% of the contract time 45# of the work\nhad been done. Good labourers were as scarce\nas good students and when one sub trade defaulted\nthis had a snowball effect on stopping the\nwork of others. Penalty clauses In building\ncontracts could not be imposed these days.\nDr Sparkes praised Mr Biggs and said that\nthe work he has done on our behalf was five times that of Mr Mooney (which was praised\nin the last issue). He told of similar bu il ding troubles in Paris and hoped that this\nwould be some consolation to us. When K itch called for questions for Dr Sparkes to answer,\na voice at the back said \"What is the name\nof the play?\" (Let us not be unkind to Dr\nSparkes, he is doing his best with a thankless\ntask.)\nThe House Committee report, reproduced in\nslightly abridged form, was presented as a basis\nfor discussion and adopted \"in toto\" after very\nlittle debate by the Union. However, provision has\nbeen made for amendments to be made at future\nUnion meetings.\nThe Governing Body have provided, free of\nrent, certain rooms for the use of the Union. The\nresponsibility of the care and running of the new\nBuilding, wh i oh will cost about \u00a3250,000, rests\nprimarily on the students of the college; all members of the Union are requested to co-operate by\ntreating the Building, fun it ure and fittings with\nproper care and respect.\nIX_ TRANS AN TAR TIC RECONNAISSANCE On Tues. l6 th Oct., Dr. V.E. Fuchs gave a most interesting and informative talk entitled\n\"Trans-Antarctic Reconnaissance\". Before a large\nenthusiastic audience, he told the story of his\nrecent visit to the Weddel Sea to set up a base\ncamp, to receive the main body of the expedition\nlater this year.\nHe was introduced by Prof. H.H. Read, who put\nforward the suggestion that the \"Theron\" was trapped\nin the ice by design rather than by accident, in\norder to attract public attention. Dr. Fuchs said\nthat as a result of the publicity thus received,\ntheir funds had been considerably swelled.\nHe took up the story from their arrival at South\nGeorgia and told of their adventures in the ice before they reached a suitable place to build the base.\nHe gave an account of the unloading of the stores and\nof the misfortunes which overtook them, until they\nwere finally ready to leave. He said he was very\nanxious to get back to the 8 members of the base party\nwho have passed a very uncomfortable winter under an\nupturned packing-case.\nHis talk was fully illustrated with colour slides,\nwh i oh were of a high standard and were extremely in-te resting. A vote of thanks was proposed by Jon Stephenson,\na past-graduate geologist here, who will be accompanying Dr. Fuchs on the expedition.\nVIEWPOINT The opening and closing hours, and general\nadministration of the new building will be as al ready outlined in the Blue Book.\no on+.H. nn -n "

Last year there were 3000 pre s ent, this year there seemed to be considerably\nmore. To the strains of dignified and glorious\nchamber music the brightly be-robed elders,\npreceded by student officials, made their way\nslowly across the arena to their positions\non the dais. The Student Orator, Randy Andy,\nread his Opening Proclamation in precise and\nstrident tones. The choir then gave a pleasant\nrendering of Purcell's \"Welcome All*. Then began the tedious presentation of\nAssociates and Dlplomates. Over three hundred\ngraduates tripped across the platform with\ntro glod y te tread and bowed in various comic\nways to the Chairman of the Governors and the\nChairman of the Delegacy. The latter part of\nthese proceedings became more soporific due\nto a stroke of genius by Miss Imogen Hoist,\nConductress of the Music. The Guildsmen were\npresented to the accompaniment of sweet and\nmelodious music (quite out of character).\nA touching ceremony followed when Mr William\nSelkirk, donor of Selkirk Hall and the Selkirk\nScholarships in Mines, was presented with an\nhonorary A.R.S. M. at the grand old age of 95.\nA precedent was set this year by the introduction of rather humorous citations accompanying the presentations of the newly elected Honorary Fellows. This is a departure which\nis to be encouraged. (We suggest that the Staff Orator should peruse the columns of Felix more\nclosely and lay In a better stock of jokes for\nnext y \u00ab*r.) The Rector then gave a short report on the\nexpansion of the College. An account of his speech will be found elsewhere in this issue.\nNever have so many suffered at the hands of\nso few as the choir (?) sang (?) aided (?) and\nabetted (?) by the organ (?) \"The Shepheard's Wonder*. This was set to music especially\nwritten for the occasion by Christopher Shawj\nwe wish he had not.\nThe College was fortunate this year in having as its special Visitor Sir John Cockc r of t, who gave an interesting discourse on\nthe future role of technology (reported\nelsewhere). The ch ql r 'then led the whole\nassembly in the national Anthem and the Ceremony\ncame to a close with the recession.\nCLARIDGES\nThis year's Commemoration Ball was not as\ndignified an affair as one might^expect from\nits venue and the price of tickets. Even our\naugust President, with his charming lady\n(rumoured to be an ex girlfriend of Oggi),\nIndulged in some rather hectic jiving. The\nBall could however be described as a success,\nin fact, on the whole very good. The crowded\nfloor, which allowed the intimacy of a rugby\nscrum, and the continuous buffet, excellently stocked with highly indigestible delicacies,\namply provided for the Freudian lusts of the\nPresident and the rest of his students.\nThe evening wore on and was finally brought\nto a close at 2.30a.m. by the singing of 'Auld\nLang Syne* and a rousing Boomalaka by the Guilds\ncontingent. Everyone seems to have enjoyed\nthemselves and we can recommend this function\nas an expensive luxury which should be indulged in at least once.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX3 Profile: ROGER SYKES\nThe Editor of Phoenix, accomplished artist,\nmusician and amateur astronomer, is a delightful\ncharacter who really enjoys the full life he leads,\nRoger Ian Sykes comes from Almondbury (pronounced\n\"Aimbree\") in the West Riding of Yorkshire and is\ntwenty-one years old. He is now a third year- Aeronantical Engineer - but after four years at I.C. While at King James G.S. in his home town, he\nacquired an enthusiasm for art and in particular\nscraper-board drawings. Today, R.I. Sykes is one\nof the few recognised scraper-board artists in this\ncountry. Ever since he won a competition at the age\nof 13, his entry appearing in the local evening paper,\nhe has had his drawings published regularly in that\npaper. How there is one in every issue. Recently Roger\nillustrated an official guide-book to Derbyshire. He\noften undertakes commissions for drawings of an architectural nature, illustrates Christmas Cards, and,\nmoreover, is a first class cartoonist.\nIt is not surprising that, when leaving school at\n18, Roger considered art as a career. He is, however,\nvery much1 interested in astronomy, and, in particular,\nastronautics. It was A.C. Clarke, Chairman of the\nBritish Interplanetary Society, who advised Roger to\ncome to I.C. Roger won a scholarship here and so it was that art became \" a hobby that pays\". This \"hobby\nthat pays\" was very useful when the first year had to\nbe repeated - it provided almost enough money to live\non. The first year s avr him as Art Editor of Felix, and\na founder-member of the I.C. Art Club. In his second\nyear at college Roger joined the Air Squadron.\nThe a foregoing should be enough to make the brown\nbag gers sit up and think again, but Phoenix, art,\naeronautical engineering and space-travel are by no\nmeans the limit of our subject's activities. At 14,\nRoger was playing a banjo in a local amateur dance\nband. Since he has been in London he has played his\nelectric guitar in o of fee houses and pubs, for cash.\nHe plays in the Air Squadron dance band, occasionally\nin the I.C. Jazz Band, and often at hostel \"sport\nparties\".\nCautiously, having noticed a vicious sheath-knife strapped to his leg, we asked Roger if he had\nany particular likes or dislikes. He likes modern\npoetry (he is compiling his own book of quotations),\n\"Home Rule for Yorkshire\", wine, song and one woman.\nHe dislikes the \"Yorkshire pudding\" served in London,\npeople who are seated in railway carriages when he has\nto stand, and women who wear trousers. When asked what\nhis ambitions were,Roger said that he hoped to graduate\nwithout further delays, and to take part time art\ntraining after he leaves whilst being employed in\nastronaut ies. Roger does not wish to make his drawing\na full-time occupation unless he can really make it Pay. His marital status, he said, was \"doubtful\" -but there is a snapshot of a very ote uri i ing lady in\nhis hostel r or a Jj Hett vt a to the tdi to t.U.L.U., Malet Street,\nLondon, W.C. I2510.56. The Editor,\n'Felix',\nImperial College.\nDear Sir,I would like to inform you, with reference\nto your Editorial of October 6th., that SENNET's accounts balanced last year without financial assistance from the University Union or any other\nbody. I would deny emphatically the implications\nof your following remark about dictation. Perhaps you were misled in your guesswork\nby the grant made by the Presidents' Council to\nassist in the paying off of the loan made In\nthe summer of 1954 when SENNET was first start ed. I do not know if I need to add that I do\nnot think that SENNET is original in having an\ninitial debt nor are we any more subject to\ndictation than the man who has an overdraft at\nhis bank.\nYours faithfully, Elizabeth Harrison,\nEditor, rEN W ST.( We thank Miss Harrison for her letter. Overcome with humiliation, we must admit the fact\nthat FELIX starts off each session with an overdraft with I.C. Union. We congratulate the staff of SENNET on the quality of the paper considering the job they must have to make ends meet.\nWe wish we could profile Sir Laurence Olivier in every issue. - J. V. B.)I.C. Union,\n17th. October.\nThe Editor,\n'Felix'.\nDear Sir, At present there are two Christmas Is lands; one is in the middle of the tac if ic Ocean, the other in the Indian Ocean southwest of Java. It is proposed to create a third island in the middle of I.C. where all shipwrecked mariners from the sens of science\nare invited to join a community dedicated to\nthe pursuit of literature and philosophy and\nconvened to preserve life from the strangleholds of authority, restriction and into ler ance. May I implore prospective Islander? to\ndigest the notice appearing on the Union's internal board by the bar and to append their\nsignatures before this venture sinks.

First man home was John Evans in27 m54s for the\nmuddy, hilly5$ mile course. Dave Briggs (an\nI.C. fresher) did well in coming in10 th. The other event was the University Trial over &i mile at Hempstead. This was easily\nwon by D. Briggs in34 m57s, in so doing he\nbeat two years U.L.1 st. team. The Club can\nalso be proud of the fact that wo had seven\nmen home in the first twenty.\nMOUNTAINEERING CLUB\nThe Freshers Meet\nTwenty campers and ten others arrived in North Wales at 2.00am. on Saturday 20th. Oct.\nThe rain came in horizontal sheets and the\nsix who were staying in the hut quickly\ndisappeared in the gloom leaving the others\nto their fate. The campers quickly revised\ntheir idea of camping at 2000ft. near Llyn\nBochlwyd and pitched the camp about 200yd s. from the road. Apart from the gale, the rain\nand the new lake which formed round the tents,\neverything went well. One pair did however\nmanage to pitch their tent inside out, a remarkable feat in the conditions.\nThe gale continued and whilst the hut men\nslept in front of a roaring fire most of the\ntwenty were sitting in squelching sleeping\nbags holding on to their shuddering tent poles.\nMid-day Saturday saw most of the campers\nbilleted in farm houses, barns\u00bband huts throughout the valley. That was the end of the rain.\nFor the rest of the weekend a high standard\nof climbing was maintained on six different cliffs. No accidents are reported although\none unfortunate leader found himself hanging\nupside down from a belay and another was saved\nfrom scattering the gaping crowd below by a holly bush.\nThe fresher s did extremely well, many doing\ntheir first rock climb in t ne pouring rain.\nIt does not rain perpetually in Wales and it is hoped that there will be enough support\nto run another coach at the end of January.\nSAILING CLUB\nThe annual knockout competition for the\nCastaway's Cup was held at Welsh Harp on the\n20th. and 21st. October, when 13 college teams\ncame to the line. I.C. entered two teams, the\n1st. team meeting U.C. in the final after beating Guys, N.E.C. and <\n*\n.\nM.C. The first race of the final was won by 'J.O. by the narrow margin of 20y pts. to 19 pts.\nThe second race was very keenly contested and\ninteresting for the tactics used. After one\nround I.C. was in a strong position with 1st.2 nd. and 5th. but one boat hit a buoy In the\nsecond round whilst duelling with two U.C. boats and so had to retire. This left li.C. the winners by 40i pts. to 37^ pts. The I.C. team was J. Conway-Jones, A. J. Dunbury, M. Ccl lye rC. Gant, J.S. Smith and Miss J. Stevens.\nSWIMMING CLUB\nThe Club had its first match of the season\nversus Kings on Friday. After e very exacting\nmatch Kings won by 36-34 pts.

    "content": "FE SQUASH NEWS Tha squash season is now well under way.\nThe 1st. team have played three matches so\nfar. In two of these, against Battersea and\nthe School of Oriental and African Studies we\nwere successful. The third match against St.\nCatherines College Cambridge played at home\non Saturday 27th October resulted in our first defeat. It was extremely hard fought and was\nonly decided in St. Catherines favour in the\nfifth game of the final tie. George Hodgson, a freshman, has now established himself on the first team and Harry\nMills, an insurgent from Capetown University\nand Richmond Rugger Club is at present providing strength at number five. We welcome back to the club Ray Scott-White\nwho two seasons ago was a regular 1st. team\nmember and is now gradually regaining his old\nform.\nHOCKEY\nIn the first match of the season, on Wed.\nOct. 17th., I.C. gave a good account of itself by drawing 3-3 with a weakened St. Bart's Hospital team at Harlington. I.C. may be\nconsidered fortunate in that they scored their\nfirst goal against only nine opponents but\nnevertheless they earned a draw. It was an\nentirely different story when the Old Dunstablians were entertained the following Saturday.\nExtremely poor positional play gave the CD's, chance to make additional use of their hard\nhitting and I.C. must be considered lucky to\nhave lost only five goal3 to one.\nComing 1st. team fixtures ares-Sat. Nov. 3rd. Vickers Armstrong H. Wed. Nov. 7th.U.L. Cup. 1st. round.\nVOLLEYBALL On the 18th. October the first lunch time\nVolley Ball game took place in Hyde Park.\nMrs Robinson \"volleyed off\" the first ball and a team of twelve then proceeded to warm\nup. Even the Editor of Phoenix joined in and was seen keenly trying his hand at\nthe game.\nContrary to popular belief this game is not a girl's game; two good teams make it good to watch and good exercise to play. It\nIs widely known on the Continent.\nAll are welcome and if numbers are large\nsome sort of booking will be introduced. So\nif you want to play, come along to our ground,\nbetween the Albert Memorial and Alexandra Gate\nany Tuesday or Thursday at 1.15 pm. Further\ndev elopements will be posted on the Pol'sh\nSociety notice board.\nThe idea to 'play ball' during the lunch\ntime breaks (Tuesday and Thursday) was originated by the Polish Society and gained the\nsupport og the Union. A proper portable\nequipment has been Durchased and this will be in use In a week or two.\nPhoto opposite; \"Robb\" starting\noff the volley ball game.\nLIX I RUGGER\nThe 1st. XV has had somewhat mixed fortunes\nto date mainly due to the l*> ck of spirit on the\nfield among the forwards ^no un decisive tackling\nand falling by the whole team. The 2n d.,A,B, and CX Vs are as yet undefeated.\nIn a match which s nou ld have been won more\neasily I.C. defeated U.C.H. by 19 pts. to 8\npts. Perhaps the best display to date was\nagainst Wasps Vandals the following Saturday.\nHere the forwards showed that they do possess\nsome vitality and good marking by the I.C. backs coupled with tireless covering by Gilbert\nsaw the Wasps leading by only a dropped goal\ntwenty minutes from 'no side'.''\"The superior\nfitness of the opposition then cat ie to the fore\nhowever, and they scored 17 more points before\nStone went over for a try in a state of near\ncollapse just before the final whistle.\nThe less said of the match against Reading\nUniversity the better, for unenthusiastic\nforward forward play, poor marking and tackling\nby the backs and a succession of petty in f ring ment s In our own 25 allowed Reading to amass\nan early lead. Only late in the second half did I.C show any spirit when they scored\n6 points from a good try (Stone) and a penalty\ngoal (Hearn).\nA considerable Improvement was shown last Saturday when I.C. defeated Rosslyn Park 'A' by two penalty goals (Stone) and two tries( Lanz and Shepherd) to two tries and a penalty\ngoal, after losing Charles In the f lr3t ten\nMinutes. As so often happens the loss of a mail brought out the best in the team and apart\nfrom one or two defensive lapses and an alarming tendency to give away penalties within a kick able distance, th9 side seemed quite imp-res sive. Stone was a tower of strength at\noutside-half and Dibley was predominant at\nwing-forward.\nResults.\nWed. Oct. 17th. I.C.19.U. C.H.8. Sat. Oct. 20th. I.C.3. Wasps-20.\nWed. Oct.* 24th. I.C.6.
