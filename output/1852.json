AlisonsCardigan13, a full-time Stan Twitter moderator,\n22 Hat Winner, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English Literature with Folklore conducted the investigation, resurfacing the six-year-old anti-Swift tweets on Tuesday\nmorning.

However, industry insiders suspect that this\ncontroversy during the rollout of her eighth album in\nthe last four years may boost Grammy odds. Although\nTaylor herself has not yet made a statement, many believe there may be a new digital album variant including\nher response as a bonus track.\nOne fan, Everwhore, says \u201cwe can\u2019t really be sur-prised, it\u2019s so difficult to be a Swiftie these days. I\u2019ve been\ndealing with the oppression for over ten years now. All\nTaylor has left to claim back is her Name and her Reputation.

Sometimes while scuba diving, I\u2019ve\nended up in situations where I couldn\u2019t\ntell up from down and I couldn\u2019t see a\nthing as my mask was filling up with\nwater. Breathing isn\u2019t always the most\nnatural at first. You may feel like taking\nout your mouthpiece and screaming\nbut of course that\u2019s the worst thing you\ncould possibly do, so you must stay calm\nand think logically. You feel much freer\nand use your own creativity to go much\nfurther. This is quite like how research\nworks and knowing that you can apply\nthe same logic in situations where your\nlife depends on it does make it easier to\ndo it when it comes to doing research on\ngravity or theoretical physics. After all,\nwhen your life doesn\u2019t depend on it, it\u2019s\nthe easy part.\nOne of the takeaways from the book\nis that gravity has a well-hidden sense\nof humour, why is this?\nThis is sort of a play of words on the\nfact that gravity is often portrayed as a\nrather serious phenomenon. We may\nhear about the \u201claws of gravity\u201d as if\nthey were firmly dictated by someone\nelse. In fact, the word gravity is very\nclose to \u201cgravis\u201d which means serious in\nLatin. What is true is that at the scales\nwe are accustomed to, gravity is indeed\nthe most serious phenomenon there is,\nacting on everything and everyone in\nexactly the same rigid and intransigent\nway. According to Einstein\u2019s theory of\nGeneral Relativity this has to be true\nunquestionably. One of the theories I\nhave been working with Prof. Andrew\nTolley, also here at Imperial, and with\nother collaborators worldwide and more\nrecently also with Prof. Toby Wiseman\nand many of our studentsm, is that on\nvery large distances or time scales, as\nlarge as the observable Universe today,\ngravity may be allowed to \u201crelax\u201d to\nsome extent and not behave in quite the\nsame way as to what we are used to here\non Earth and in the Solar System and in\nour cluster of galaxies. This could help\nus with what we call the Cosmological\nConstant Problem which is one of the\nmost profound problems of modern\nphysicsattheinterfacebetweenquantum\nparticle physics and gravity, two of the\npillars of modern physics.\nThe strap line of your book is A\nLife in Pursuit of Gravity. Scientists, in\npursuit of answers about our universe,\nhave proposed many different forms\nof gravity\u2014such as general relativity,\nquantum gravity, massive gravity,\nhigher-spin gravity, and more! How\ndo you construct/revitalise a theory\nof gravity? And what are some of the\nmodern, up-and-coming methods\nused to verify proposed theories of\ngravity?\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that in many\nways there is no shortage of novel and\ncreative extensions to gravity. In fact,\nit is relatively easy to come up with a\nbrand-new grand idea that will change\neverything. The problem is that these\nalmost never work, and are almost\nnever as original and creative as one\nmay think. The reality is that General\nRelativity has done an impeccable job\nat describing gravity so far, so we really\nneed to learn from it and base ourselves\non it. The really challenging part is to\ntweak General Relativity ever so slightly\nwithout making it fall apart completely\nand that\u2019s where it requires a huge level\nof ingenuity in appreciating how to turn\nthe right knobs in the right way while\nholding the right pieces in place. In fact,\na lot of it is in the structural integrity of\nthe model in a way that can often not be\nseen from the outside. You know you\u2019ve\ndone it right if from the outside almost\nno one can see the tricks and devices you\nsecretly engineered.\nWhat message or piece of advice\nwould you like to share with students\nwho are just starting their journey in\nscience? Could you use a concept from\ngravity to illustrate your point?\nEmbrace the free-fall! No two\ntrajectories will ever be the same, so\nthere is no point comparing yourself\nwith others, just trust your own and most\nimportantly enjoy it! The ride may not\nend up quite as you expected and you may\nnot end up where you originally thought\nyou were headed but that\u2019s ok, that\u2019s just\nfree-fall adapting for the curvature or\nthe complexity of the reality in which we\nfind ourselves but that\u2019s what makes your\njourney so unique and so precious.\nProf Claudia de Rham, moderator of the Abdus Salam Fesitval lectures delivered by Prof Brian Cox CBE and Prof Atish Dabholkar in January 2024.\nFrom left to right: Prof Claudia de Rham, Prof Jerome Gauntlett, Prof Brian Cox CBE, Prof Atish Dabholkar, Prof Daniel Waldram, Prof Ian Walmsley FRS CBE, Prof Hugh Brady Taylor Pomfret\nGeneral Relativity\nhas done an\nimpeccable job at\ndescribing gravity,\nwe need to learn\nfrom it and base\nourselves on it.\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | BOOKS 04 October 2024\nI\nfinished Tripticks late at night, with a\nglass of strong whiskey in hand while\nmy father expounded to me about a\nmysterious methanol poisoning of some\nold Antarctican physicist. The whiskey\nwas delicious, and this strange division\nof attention felt right for a novel closer\nto a pop-art collage than traditional\nliterature. The book was grotesque,\ndeeply confusing, and at times made me\nlaugh out loud for minutes on end.\nAnn Quin was an experimental\nEnglish writer in the sixties and early\nseventies. She was often depressed,\nusually stoned, and died by suicide off\nBrighton pier in 1973. Most of her stories\nconcern a certain grim post-war miasma\nthat hung low upon Britain during her\nlifetime; in Tripticks, she takes a jaunt\nacross the pond to a radically different\nenvironment. Quin presents a vast,\nhallucinatory USA, drowning in excess:\nall golden deserts, white McMansions,\nand wild, hedonistic terror.\nQuin was writing in reaction to the\n\u2018peace and love\u2019 hippie naivete of the\nsixties. She cordially despised Jack\nKerouac\u2019s similar novel On The Road,\nmainly because of its zen, happy ending.\nIn Tripticks she attempts to record the\nhypocrisy and frivolity of that era \u2013 not\nfrom a conservative standpoint, but\nfrom one of sober, progressive disgust.\nNotably, there are no working-class\ncharacters in Tripticks. The tortured men\nand women who criss-cross America\n(finding brief Life\u2019s Callings in cult\norgies, Freudian analysis, commercial\nreligion, appropriation of native ritual,\netc.) are universally upper-class drifters\nwith Cadillac-driving fathers and sky-blue swimming pools. At no point on this\ncaustic Odyssey does anyone run out of\nmoney.\nThe story is presented as a prose-poem, bouncing quickly between\nimages, from memory to experience\nto premonition. The protagonist\u2019s\nthoughts are often indistinguishable\nfrom commercial slogans and snippets\nof TV-speak, in a way that reminded\nme of Don DeLillo or some New Wave\nsci-fi. The core narrative \u2014 as far as I\ncould extract it \u2014 is about a man being\npursued by, or perhaps pursuing, his \u201cNo.\n1 X-Wife\u201d and her new \u201cschoolboy gigolo\u201d\nof a lover. Large chunks of the book,\nthough, are fragmentary flashbacks to\nthe protagonist\u2019s lives with ex-wives one\nthrough three, and all the violent and\nincestuous degeneration those lives were\npainted with. Tripticks is a road trip, but\nalso a bundle of letters, a Sears catalogue,\nand a sharp but stifled scream.\nLike Anna Kavan\u2019s Ice, this is also\nan early feminist text with no explicit\nfemale perspective. The main character\nis cruel and hyperactive, viewing all\nwomen in terms of their sexual potential\nand all men in terms of sexual rivalry.\nThe women themselves are presented as\nsuperficial, scheming, and universally\npromiscuous. Sex in this book is more\na matter of desperate, depraved one-upmanship than anything else, with new\nfetishes described in the same tone as\nnovel features in the ex-wife\u2019s gleaming\nautomobiles. Still, Quin was a staunch\nfeminist. She seems to be taking aim both\nat chauvinistic life-lenses and at the kind\nof abstracted, white, capitalist feminism\nthat was prominent at the time. She saw\nthis as altogether too divorced from the\nmaterial conditions of real women under\nbondage. I can\u2019t claim to be an expert on\nthis field of thought, but it was definitely\nan interesting read.\nExperimental, frenetic, and darkly\ncomedic, Tripticks is a great book for\nanyone plumbing the stranger byroads\nof British literature. If you\u2019re ever on a\nlong ride across the American southwest,\nconsider thumbing through this to pass\nthe hours \u2014 and don\u2019t trust anyone with\na name like \u201cNightripper\u201d. It\u2019s a red flag.\nReview:\nTripticks\nby Ann Quin\nBOOKS\nBooksWriter\nDANIEL HESK\nDaniel unpacks the absurdity and\nexperimental storytelling of Ann\nQuin\u2019s surreal novel Tripticks\nBridgeman Oswald Jones\nWouldyou\nliketosharea\nreviewofyour\nrecentread?\nSendusyourreview(s)\natbooks.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

To\ntell the truth, after deciding I wanted\nto study in Germany, I realised it was\nmy only option in conjunction with my\nBiological Sciences degree. Language\nwas something I had always adored at\nschool, and I was determined to combine\nmy German A-Level with my studies\nat Imperial. It was a chance to not only\nindulge in a new culture, but witness\nfirst-hand the benefits of sustaining\ninternational relations, something so\nimportant in a world of collaborative\nscience.\nHeidelberg itself is a city of around\n150,000 people in the southwestern state\nof Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. I fell in love with\nthis place in the Neckar Valley where\nscience and the arts exist so cohesively.\nBut perhaps this is not surprising, and\nI am simply following in the footsteps\nof professors and poets alike who\nrelished its romantic setting. Take the\nPhilosophenweg or \u201cPhilosopher\u2019s path\u201d\nfor example, where writers and poets\nhave spent many an hour reflecting on\nthe trials and tribulations of life, not\nto mention the student population.\nHeidelberg University is the oldest in\nGermany, dating back to 1386, and I\nfeel proud to have been a member of its\nrenowned international community.\nThe stanzas that follow are somewhat\nof a diary entry \u2013 or perhaps a love letter\naddressed directly to the individual\nmoments, the people that collectively\nwrote the pages of my Heidelberg\nstory (combined with a little humour).\nThrough my poem, laced with a couple\nGerman words for good measure, I\nhope to encourage and inspire the next\ngenerationofImperialundergraduatesto\ntake the leap that is studying abroad. I\u2019d\nbe lying if I said it was plain sailing in its\nentirety but trust me when I say it is the\nchallenges and rollercoaster journey of\nemotions for which you will be eternally\ngrateful. The experiences you face will\nbe uniquely yours and that, I feel, is a\nbeautiful thing. My year in Heidelberg\nwas a time of immense personal growth,\nand I built relationships and made\nmemories I will treasure for the rest of\nmy life.

Funding has been a nagging issue for university\nmanagement for the past few years, as inflation has\ncaused home fees to drop in real value and has also been\nexacerbated by a drop in international students from India\nand Nigeria in particular. These students are more likely\nto bring dependants such as their families with them,\nhowever, curbs on dependents visas by the previous Tory\ngovernment has led to a decrease in numbers (and student\nvisas) in general. Quite a shot in the foot, considering\nthe value and worth British universities provide in terms\nof economic output and soft power globally, but the\nJohnson-Truss-Sunak administrations were extremely\nshort-termist, trying to win back a base that was either\ntoo radicalised, or too offput by their faux populism.\nUniversities have relied on international students\nfor a bulk of their funding, and the volatility of student\ndemographics, inflation and other factors have led to\n40% of universities running on a deficit for the 2023/24\nacademic year, according to a report by the Office for\nStudents.\nAs Vice-Chancellors (the equivalent of the Provost for\nuniversitieswhodonotusetheAmericanisedmanagement\nstructure Imperial uses) come to grips, many voices have\nrung out to offer solutions, not least our own Provost, Ian\nWalmsley. In a May 2024 piece for Times Higher Education,\nWalmsley argued for quite a unique solution beyond the\nusual ideas of raising home fees or introducing a graduate\ntax. He argues that \u201cwe could separate tuition fees from\nloans\u201d allowing for greater control of prices by institutions\nrather than the government. Interesting. Walmsley later\ndescribes how the difference between the government\nloan and tuition price would be made up either by\n\u201cemployers with a need for particular skills\u201d, or even a\n\u201cadditional, university-underwritten loan scheme\u201d (oh!) or\nperhaps more scholarships and bursaries. Interestingly,\nWalmsley gives the example of the perennially mentioned/\ncompared/better-off MIT as an example for tuition waivers\nand a \u201cneeds-blind\u201d application system.\nAs a final remark, the Provost also said \u201crather than\nblanket additional funds for all students, it will suffice to\ndirect funding towards the facilities needed for world-leading education, student support and research.\u201d It\u2019s very\nhard not to look at this very cynically as the Provost just\nasking for more funding for Imperial, which ostensibly, fits\nthe criteria he sets out quite well.\nBut as no official government policy has been\nenacted, and Universities UK, the representative body\nof Vice-Chancellors (and the Provost), has just released\na \u201cblueprint for change\u201d the future of funding is far from\nbeing clear.\nWe(t)lcome Fair\nThis year\u2019s Welcome Fair was a mixed experience. Felix\nreceived a lot of signups with a large number of writers\nwho are interested in a variety of sections. It was great\nmeeting a lot of you, and we can\u2019t wait to see what the\nyear has in store for us. It wasn\u2019t fun being in the dripping\nrain, being soaked through whilst you desperately try\nto interest the vast swathes of freshers disinterestedly\nswarming past (and trying to get out of the rain).\nOur marquee had several leaks, which led to several\neditors desperately trying to use a bin bag to hold water\nfrom one of the leaks. Everything was wet, and I still feel\nwet as I write this.\nTo the Union\u2019s credit, it wasn\u2019t their fault we were all\nsoaked. That was the rain\u2019s. The Fair was planned to be\noutside for security reasons- to prevent the estimated\n11,000 students from crushing each other. A source close\nto the matter has told me that issues with Queens Lawn\nsuch as activism may lead to bigger issues, and also that\nQueens Lawn would be damaged as inevitably some 11,000\nstudents walked around. Similar reasons were given for\nthe lack of use of indoor spaces. In previous years we have\nhad a massive crush as clueless freshers try to navigate\nthe confined walkways and paths around campus. Whilst\nit\u2019s fair and reasonable, it was also a somewhat miserable\nexperience.\nAnd on a final note, the end of Welcome Week doesn\u2019t\nmean you can\u2019t join clubs and societies anymore. If\nany readers are still interested, they can visit the Union\nwebsite to see further details on every club or society that\nthey want to join. Here at Felix we accept newcomers\nyear round, and are more than happy to see fresh faces\nthroughout the year- and I\u2019m sure many other societies\nfeel the same way. So, if the rain scared you off, it\u2019s not too\nlate- make your university experience about more than\nlearning.\nEDITORIAL\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"

Solutions to these\nproblems in four dimensions were only\ngiven in 2010 by Imperial physicists\nand professors Claudia de Rham,\nAndrew Tolley, and New York University\nprofessor Gregory Gabadadze.

Having\njust landed from quite a different part of\nthe world, Madagascar, the culture shock\nwas deeper than I would have admitted to\nmyself.\nWhile all the lectures were great, it was\nhard to connect at first with the real kind\nof science that college teaches. I learnt\nto appreciate the little things, and while\nthe first few weeks were quite tough, I set\nup a network of friends that eventually\nmade things much easier. With a group of\nfriends, I founded the first astronomical\nsociety of our university. We set up a plan\nwhich I went to defend high up in the\nUniversity Presidency at the time, asking\nfor space on campus. With their approval,\nour society slowly grew. The society\nfinally made me feel like I belonged to\na larger cause, something bigger, and\nsoon everything else about my university\nexperience followed much more easily.\nRecently, I was invited back to give\na talk at my old University.

The\nproject was studying the correlation\nbetween the gravitational and magnetic\nfields of Mars, with exclusive data\njust freshly recovered from the Mars\nPathfinder. In the moment, it was so\nexciting! Or so, I thought it should have\nbeen. But as I kept going through my\nproject, I slowly started to realize that\nthis kind of data analysis wasn\u2019t what\nmade me tick.\nThe context was amazing of course,\nand so were the people I worked with,\nbut the actual work wasn\u2019t what I was\nfinding the most exciting. That\u2019s when I\nrealized that I was much more attracted\nto theoretical concepts.

The\nstaggering two-figure unemployment\nrates of the 1980s are now hardly\nmore than an unpleasant memory.\nIronically, the UK is now faced with the\nopposite problem: while it boasts an\nunemployment rate of 4.4%, comfortably\nbelow the average given by the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation\nand Development (OECD), economic\ngrowth is hindered by a shortage of\nworkers. About one in ten available jobs\ncountry-wide does not find a suitable\ncandidate. This overall value hides\ngreat sector-specific discrepancies, with\nvacancies notably reaching a whopping\n18% in manufacturing, according to a\nrecent study by Statistica.\nThis crisis would be more accurately\nlabelled as skills shortage, as the pool\nof Britons seeking employment is\ntheoretically sufficient to satisfy all\noffers. While wage expectations factor\nin too, a mismatch between the skills\nrequired and those present on the job\nmarket still account for about a third\nof the vacancies, disproportionately\naffecting small businesses.\nOn the other hand, many recent\ngraduates are faced with low demand\nin their professional area, and struggle\nto jump unto the jobs market without a\nreconversion or a serious scaling down\nof their wage ambitions. The cost of\nundergraduate education in the UK,\nwhich is now the highest in the rich\nworld, makes those situations more dire\nthan in other European countries. The\nyearlyinvoicereceivedbyahomestudent\nin a British university could cover 50\nyears of education in a French university.\nAs such, most degrees that don\u2019t prepare\nfor high-income jobs have an appalling\nlow return on investment.\nExcellence in the field of humanities\nand arts remains valued in the UK, a\nlegacy of the times when the country\u2019s\ndecision-makers were better versed in\nGreek poetry than in data analysis. But\ntoday, the visibility of highly successful\npublic figures with such backgrounds,\nlikeformerPrimeMinisterBorisJohnson,\nstem mostly from survivor bias. In fact,\nonly about half of male undergraduates\nwill get a positive economic return on\ntheir English or Philosophy degree,\nwhereas Maths or Computing degrees\nare virtually always a good investment.\nThis would pose little concern if\nstudents enjoyed their degree and career\nmore,butthelevelsofstudentsatisfaction\ncorrelate with the environment of study\nmuch more than with the choice of a\nuniversity major. A more realistic and\ncareers-targeted approach to course\nguidance is thus required. Naturally,\nsecondary-school students which a\ngenuine passion for liberal arts shouldn\u2019t\nbe discouraged from pursuing this path.\nBut it is a shame that those who feel\ndaunted by STEM, or aren\u2019t yet motivated\nby any specific subject, too often follow\nthrough by default. Reconversions to any\nline of work are much easier for those\nwho already possess employable skills.\nEnsuring the offer and demand\nfor employment meet constitutes\nsensible policing, and is all the more\nbeneficial in a context of fast-changing\njob opportunities. Brexit-induced\nrestrictions to immigration, combined to\na particularly slow recovery of workforce\nactivity following the Covid pandemic,\nhave caused unprecedented imbalances\nin the jobs market. Endowing workers\nwith sought-after skills would be crucial\nin turning Britain\u2019s GDP growth figures\npositive again.\nThat would demand an ambitious\nparadigm shift. Qualified blue-collar\njobs are too often shunned, although\nthey can offer hefty salaries for those\nwith the appropriate skillset and\ninterest, in addition to a low vulnerabiliy\nto AI replacement. Inspiration could\nbe taken from countries like Germany\nwhich promote a dual education system,\ncomplementing classroom theory with\nwork experience in partner companies.\nApprenticeships there are not only\nfacilitated by law, but a true cultural\nnorm.\nTo increase economic incentive, the\nBritish government could raise the cost\nof degrees leading to low employment\ndemand and use the funds to create\nlearning paths targeted to industries\nwith the most alarming recruitment\nissues. Last month, Prime Minister\nKeith Starmer has launched a new\nprogram, dubbed Skills England, that\naims at \u201cfir[ing] up the training of all\nUK workers\u201d, in a promising first step.\nThat alone remains unlikely to suffice.\nA country still so permeated with the\nchildhood dream of Harry Potter\u2019s Sorting\nHat should not shy away from more\nassertive career guidance.\nCOMMENTS\nThe case for better\ncareer guidance\nCommentsEditor\nGUILLAUME FELIX\nOnly half of male undergraduates will\nget a positive economic return on their\nEnglish or Philosophy degree\n\u201c\nThe skillset of many Britons aren\u2019t properly\ntargeted to market needs Many key industries in Europe are understaffed.

A 93-meter catwalk stage,\nforming a figure-eight loop around each\nwing of the stadium, allowed Adele to\nconnect with her fans. I had never before\nconsidered the idea of a pop-up stadium,\nbut I thought, \u201cWell, it is Adele.\u201d A quick\ncalculation of an average ticket priced at\n\u20ac125, multiplied by 80,000 seats, and 10\nshows, gives an estimated income of 100\nmillion euros in sales.

The plant had run\nfor 57 years and its closure has seen widespread\ncoverage in the national press with The Guardian calling\nthe shutdown the \u201cend of an era.\u201d\nCoal has been part of the UK\u2019s energy mix since 1882\nand has played a significant role in powering the UK. As\nnew technologies show themselves to be superior and\ncarbon pricing come into effect, coal power generation\nis going into steep decline. The closure marks a major\nmilestone for climate action in the UK, and sets it apart\nas the first G7 nation to achieve this goal.\nThe plant was closed after a just-transition plan was\nagreed for its staff and it is\nexpected to take two years to decommission. The site\nwill become one of three sites for the East Midlands\nFreeport, which is government-supported. Additionally,\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says\nthey will support green jobs at the site.\nThe power plant was subject to some controversy\nafter 114 activists had been arrested as part of a protest in\n2009 with evidence from an undercover police officer,\nMark Kennedy. Mr Kennedy joined Sumac Community\ncentre in 2003 and formed several romantic relationships with women who were involved. The case against\nthe activists was thrown out in 2011 because Mr Kennedy had failed to disclose who he was. Another undercover police officer said, to The BBC, \u201cI would seek out the\nmost vulnerable people in those communities. The reason for that is the most vulnerable people are the easiest\nto manipulate.\u201d\nEd Matthew, director at climate\nchange think tank E3G, said\n\u201cThe UK was the first country to build a coal-fired\npower station. It is\nright that it is the\nfirst major economy to exit coal power. This is true global leadership, lighting the path for other countries to\nfollow.\u201d\nThe closure is something to celebrate, but there\u2019s certainly room for sentimentality as infrastructure that\nwas both deeply flawed and had a profound impact on\nour society is shut down. The Nottingham Post quotes local historian Ian Castledine saying \u201cI\u2019m here to see the\nold girl out. ... We saw the last coal delivery come in a\ncouple of weeks ago, which was quite emotional. Cooling towers have been a huge part of the landscape of\nGreat Britain for a long time. ... They were such a landmark \u2013 wherever you go, people would say \u2018I know I\u2019m\nhome when I see the cooling towers\u2019.\u201d Maybe someday\nwe will think of renewable infrastructure as Castledine\ndoes of cooling towers.\nSeparately, the Coal Authority, the UK\u2019s coal regula-tor, has refused to grant licences for a new coal mine\nin Cumbria. This comes after a High Court ruling on\nthe 13th declaring the mine unlawful in a case brought\nby Friends of the Earth and South Lakes Action on Climate Change. The Tories backed the coal mine in the\ncase, with Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, agreeing that\nthe mine would be net-zero. However, the new\nLabour government withdrew their backing,\nadmitting that the 99% of the mine\u2019s emissions from burning the coal should\nhave been\ntaken into\naccount.\nENVIRONMENT\nBritain\u2019s last coal-fired power plant shuts down\nEnvironmentEditor\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nD\navid Lammy gave his first\nmajor speech as Foreign\nSecretary on 17th September in Kew Gardens. His speech\nwas intersectional, covering\nglobal inequality, indigenous\nknowledge, and racial justice\nall as part of \u2013 and essential to \u2013\nclimate justice.\nLammy explained the core\nidea of his approach that \u201cnothing could be more central to the\nUK\u2019s national interest than delivering global progress on arresting rising temperatures.\u201d He\nlater told Outrage + Optimism\nthat \u201cI\u2019m outraged morally that,\nit\u2019s still the case that global majority countries, global South\ncountries, are feeling very left\nbehind.\u201d\nLammy also announced he\nwould be appointing Special\nRepresentatives for Climate\nChange and for Nature, who will\nsupport him and Ed Miliband.\nThe Special Representative for\nClimate Change will be Rachel\nKyte, Professor of Practice in\nClimate Policy at the Oxford.\nDavid Lammy calls for\nclimate justice in Kew\nLecture\nEnvironmentEditor\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nUK total inland coal consumption, 1913-2023, from UK Government, 2024\nDavid Lammy by Lauren Hurley / No\n10 Downing Street - Number 10 Flickr\npage, OGL 3\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n16 | BUSiNESS 04 October 2024\nS\neptember 18th marked a dramatic\nmove by the Federal Reserve (Fed) to\ncut interest rates by 50 basis points,\nwhich contrasted sharply with the Bank\nof England\u2019s (BoE) decision the following\nday to keep rates steady. The difference in\ncentral bank policy has created divergent\neconomic outlooks between the U.S.\nand the U.K. in the currency and bond\nmarkets. Interest rates represent the\ncost at which banks lend to one another\nand significantly impact the economy.\nLower rates stimulate the economy by\nencouraging borrowing and spending,\nwhich can increase the money supply.\nAlternatively, in periods of high inflation,\nwhere there is too much money in\nthe system chasing too few goods\nand services, higher interest rates are\nimplemented by the governing central\nbank to decrease the money supply,\nthereby decreasing inflation.\nCurrently, the inflation rate in the U.K.\nis at 2.2%, and the inflation rate in the\nU.S. is at 2.5%. It is worth noting, that the\ndecision to raise, decrease, or hold steady\ninterest rates depends on factors like\nemployment and growth. For example,\nin early 2022, both countries\u2019 central\nbanks were concerned with bringing\ndown inflation, despite being in the cycle\nof raising interest rates and holding them\nsteady.\nBonds are significantly influenced by\na country\u2019s interest rate. A bond is a loan\nthat governments offer to investors, and\nin return for buying government debt,\ninvestors receive interest payments. The\nyield on these bonds refers to the return\nan investor expects to receive each year\nuntil the bond\u2019s maturity passed, and can\nchange as interest rates move around.\nGenerally, as interest rates decline, the\nprices of existing bonds increase, and\ntheir yield decreases. The price of a bond\nand its yield are inversely proportional.\nAs an example, in the U.S., if the interest\nrate is at 5% and then decreases to 4%,\nexisting bonds with the 5% interest rate\nbecome more attractive to investors.\nThis causes the price of these bonds to\nincrease; however, the return on the\nbond (the yield) decreases because the\nfixed interest payments are now a smaller\npercentage of the higher bond price.\nWith the Fed\u2019s decision to cut interest\nrates, the yield on U.K. gilts (bonds) has\novertaken U.S. bonds. In a recent episode\nof the Odd Lots podcast, Dan Ivascyn,\nChief Investment Officer of Pimco \u2013\nwhich manages $2 trillion in assets and\nhas significant exposure to bonds \u2013\nstated, \u201cThe U.S. is not the only game in\ntown anymore... [The UK bond market]\nout-yields the United States.\u201d On the\nday of the BoE announcement, two-year\ngilt yields increased by 0.03 percentage\npoints. Likewise, the pound rose 0.3\npercentage points.\nThese higher yields on gilts are\ncontributing to a stronger pound as\ninvestors pile into pounds. Although,\nother factors also drive the currency\nmarket, such as expectations of future\ninterest rate policy, market sentiment,\nand geopolitical factors. This drives\nup demand and increases the pound\u2019s\nvalue on the foreign exchange markets.\nAs a result, the pound is now at its\nstrongest level relative to the U.S. dollar\nsince 2022, which could cause a range\nof economic consequences, from more\nforeign investment to better deals for\nU.K. consumers.\nAsthepoundbecomesmoreexpensive\nrelative to the U.S. dollar, exports from\nthe U.K. would become less competitive.\nHowever, a rising pound gives U.K.-based\nconsumers increased buying power for\nimports. Ultimately, the BoE is likely to\nbegin cutting rates, as signaled in the\nlatest meeting, if inflation continues\nto trend downward. In the meantime,\ninvestors might consider purchasing\ngilts to lock in higher rates. Additionally,\nthe pound-flush U.K. resident could take\nadvantage of the favourable spread by\nplanning an overseas vacation.\nBUSINESS\nDiverging paths for the Bank of\nEngland and the Federal Reserve\nBUSINESSWRITER\nDANIELA FIRAM\nThe Bank of England holds rates steady while the Federal Reserve cuts\nrates, impacting bond and currency markets\nBank of England.

Each table\nwas supplied a trashbag, two chairs and\nenough space for two members, however\nmany societies found the space limiting.\nContrastingly to last year's Freshers\nFair, there was a strong presence of\nsecurity staff hired to enforce the oneway movement of the crowd. Gates,\norganised due to security requirements,\nwere placed around the entire fair, with a\nsingle entrance to the public.\nThe sleek, informative map, shared\nonly digitally in support of sustainability\nefforts and provided to societies the\nmorning of, showed the one-way flow, the\nentrance and exit as the Exhibition Road\nand City and Guilds Building entrance\nrespectively. Fortunately, the Fair was not\nseperated from rest of South Kensington's\ncampus, with students easily able to take\na lunch break or rush to the library to\nprint more flyers.\nAt the fair, each CSP presented their\npurpose via posters, members dressed in\nartistic or athletic costumes, and various\nitems chosen to grab the attention\nof people passing by. For example,\nFelix's Editor-in-Chief Mohammad\nfrequently wore the large cat costume\nhead, attracting noticeable attention.\nOtherwise, the K-Pop Society brought\nvarious lightsticks, the Drama Society\nbrought posters of their last shows and,\nif possible, sport teams brought their\nathletic equipment to parade.\nIn spirit of the rivalry between\nImperial College (IC) and Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine (ICSM), sport\nsocieties drew up posters making claims\nabout whose team beat their counterpart\nin the opposing school. One girl walked\naround in the rain with a poster reading\n\"We beat IC 8-0\". Students unaware of the\nnew categorisation of all CSPs may have\nnoticed that ICSM and IC sports societies\nwere no longer in the same section. ICSM\nstudents were granted their own student\nunion section, named ICSM Student\nUnion (ICSMSU) earlier this term.\nAs always, CSPs provided arrays of\nQR codes linked to websites, WhatsApp\ngroupchats, Instagram pages, newsletter\nforms, and membership signups, hoping\nto establish immediate relationships\nwith prospective students. Fortunately\nfor every society, a new Imperial student\ncould easily be identified by their newly\ndesigned bright red lanyard.\nDeputy President Christian Cooper\nheld up the spirit by positing various\ninterviews with society members on\nIC Union's Instagram @icunion. Other\nstaff helped students find their stalls,\nprovided cloths to soak up the rain, and\nplastic bags and tape rolls for students to\nbind tents closer together to keep water\nfrom dripping onto students.\nDespite the offical ending of the Fair\nat 5pm, many societies began packing up\nclose to 4pm, mostly due to the decrease\nnumber of visitors and the increasing\npour of rain. Wet posters and papers\nwere thrown into bins, as stickers, and\nmemorabilia were packed securely into\nany available bags. Many students waited\nbeneath the tents, shoes soaked, before\nrushing to the closest building. As\ngroups left their stalls, tables and chairs\nleft folded on the floor, lanyards were\nreturned to the staff and coverage was\nsought by every student.\nDespite the terrible weather, every\nstudentwaspartoftheFair;ifnotpitching,\nthen listening to their counterpart.\nAfter Fresher's Fair, the real work of\nintroducing new students into societies\nbegins; highlighting that the fair \u2014 while\nincredibly useful \u2014 is only a small aid in\ngrowing and maintaining a successful\nsociety. Now CSPs need to guide every\ninterested fresher step-by-step to avoid\nloosing them to another CSP.\nWith the end of Welcome Week\napproaching, we at Felix hope everyone\nhad a wonderful week and can avoid the\nfollow up to Fresher's Fair: Fresher's Flu.\nSPORTS ZONE9-64\nCOMMUNITY ZONE 65-90\nICSMSU ZONE 91-154\nARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 155-184\nHOBBIES ZONE185-214\nCOMMERCIAL ZONE\nCULTURE ZONE 281-329\n64 62 60 58 56 54 52 50 48 46 44 42 40 38 36 34 32 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10\n1\n3\n5\n7\n2\n4\n6\n8\n63 61 59 57 55 53 51 49 47 45 43 41 39 37 35 33 31 29 27 25 23 21 19 17 15 13 11 9\n89 87 85 83 81 79 77 75 73 71 69 67 65\n90 88 86 84 82 80 78 76 74 72 70 68 66\n109 107 105 103 101 99 97 95 93 91\n110 108 106 104 102 100 98 96 94 92\n133 131 129 127 125 123 121 119 117 115\n134 132 130 128 126 124 122 120 118 116 114 11 3 112 111\n153 151 149 147 145 143 141 139 137 135\n154 152 150 148 146 144 142 140 138 136\n155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184\n213\n211\n209\n207\n205\n203\n201\n199\n197\n195\n193\n191\n189\n187\n185\n214\n212\n210\n208\n206\n204\n202\n200\n198\n196\n194\n192\n190\n188\n186\n225 223 221 219 217 215\n224 222 220 218 216\n243 241 239 237 235 233 231 229 227\n244 242 240 238 236 234 232 230 228 226\n245 247 249 251 253 255 257 259 261 263 265 267\n246 248 250 252 254 256 258 260 262 264 266\n269 271 273 275 277 279\n268 270 272 274 276 278\n306 304 302 300 298 296 294 292 290 288\n305 303 301 299 297 295 293 291 289 287 286 285\n329 327 325 323 321 319 317 315 313 311 309 307\n330 328 326 324 322 320 318 316 314 312 310 308\n280\n281 282 283 284\nACADEMIC\nZONE 226-279\nQUEEN\u2019S\nTOWER\nDANGOOR\nPLAZA\nOUTDOOR\nZONE 215-225\nRAMP\nFACULTY\nBUILDING\nSKEMPTON\nBUILDING\nCITY AND\nGUILDS\nBUILDING\nSHERFIELD\nBUILDING\nGREAT\nHALL\nCENTRAL\nLIBRARY\nDYSON BUILDING OF\nDESIGN ENGINEERING\nRCS1 BUILDING\nSIR ALEXANDER\nFLEMING BUILDING\nCHEMISTRY BUILDING\nSIR ERNST CHAIN BUILDINGWOLFSON LABORATORIES\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE STUDENTS\u2019 UNION\n1-8\nDALBY\nCOURT\nFresher's Fair Map Imperial College Union\n\n"

Walking along 5th Avenue, I\nturned right at 50th St to finally reach the entrance\nto NBC Studios, the iconic building where The Tonight\nShow Starring Jimmy Fallon is filmed every weeknight.\nUpon previously catching a glimpse of the guest\nlist, I was delighted to see Channing Tatum at the top.\nTatum is an American actor and film producer who\ninitially got famous from films like Step Up (2006)\nand Magic Mike (2012), and I had recently watched Fly\nMe to the Moon (2024) where he co-starred with actress\nScarlett Johansson. Most importantly, he was named\nthe \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d by People Magazine in 2012.\nDuring the show, Fallon started off by bringing\nup his role as Gambit in Deadpool & Wolverine (2024),\nthe highest-grossing film of his career. Tatum talked\nabouthowemotionalhewasabouttherole,explaining\nthat he had \u201cbeen trying to play that character for the\nlast 20 years\u201d. He expressed his gratitude for Kevin\nFeige, current president of Marvel Studios, and Ryan\nReynolds, who starred as Deadpool, for making it\nhappen. When further asked about the potential for a\nstandalone movie after the acquisition of 21st\nCentury\nFox by Disney in 2019, he playfully mentioned that\nhe would \u201ckill kittens to make that happen.\u201d In\nhindsight, former US President Donald Trump might\nhave watched this show to get inspiration for the\nrecent debate!\nThe conversation then moved on to Tatum\u2019s work on\nlast month\u2019s psychological thriller Blink Twice (2024)\nas tech entrepreneur Slater King. He had worked with\ndirector Zo\u00eb Kravitz, also his fianc\u00e9e, commenting\nthat \u201cthe movie is her whole personality, and the\nmovie is terrifying\u201d. He further mentioned that the\noriginal title of the movie was \u2018Pussy Island\u2019, giving the\nimpression that Kravitz has a headstrong personality\nand a somewhat unconventional approach to directing\nfilms. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly,\nKravitz stated that \u201cwomen were offended by the word\u201d\nand that society is not ready to embrace it yet, leading\nher to change the title.\nThesecondguestwasLizaCol\u00f3n-Zayas,anAmerican\nactress from the Bronx known for playing in the\ncomedy-drama series The Bear (2022) as Tina Marrero.\nFallon expressed his excitement for her success as she\nwon the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding\nSupporting Actress in a Comedy Series.\nFinally, to end the show, the band Lawrence\nperformed their new song \u201cWhatcha Want\u201d from\ntheir fourth studio album Family Business. Lawrence\nis a sibling-duo band founded by Clyde and Gracie\nLawrence. Their father Marc Lawrence is a prominent\nfilmmaker, screenwriter, and producer known for\nmovies like Miss Congeniality (2000). Lawrence was\npart of the audience that night and his presence was\nacknowledged by Jimmy Fallon throughout the show.\nNeedless to say, towards the end of the show, someone\nin the audience asked him the typical question of \u201cHow\ndo I become a filmmaker?\u201d only to receive the generic\nanswer of \u201cJust keep going.\u201d\nThe most ironic part about these comedy show\ntapings was the sign at the front signalling the\naudience when to laugh. In my opinion, this\ndiminishes the comedic aspect of the show when\nhumour is, at its essence, mostly subjective. On the\nother hand, it makes perfect sense for a comedy\nshow to have the live audience laugh at everything\nthat has the potential to be amusing to at least\none person. Humour is unpredictable. Even when\nlooking at the YouTube videos from this particular\nshow, there are a few clips that were more impactful\nwith millions of views. Others, not so many. When\nanything has the potential to go viral, every second\nof the show matters.\nFrom the perspective of contemporary society,\nsocial media plays a significant role in comedy,\nshows, and film. As shortened media content with\nedited clips of longer videos get more popular over\ntime, watching a live 40-minute running time\ncomedy show could even seem exhausting. One\nmight ask, was it worth it? Yes. Why? It was free! So,\nif you ever find yourself in NYC, get a ticket to the\nJimmy Fallon Show.\nThe Jimmy\nFallon Show\nExperience\nFILM&TV\nPeeking behind\nthe curtains of a\nlate-night talk show.\nFilmWriter\nSIJUNG LEE\nHe had \u201cbeen trying to play that\ncharacter for the last 20 years\u201d\n\u201c\n\n"

To\nsell out the stadium for consecutive\nshows is an achievement only done by\nlegends. Such a title is well deserved\nfor world-famous country-turned-pop\nsinger and songwriter Taylor Swift.\nThrough its genius strategy, Swift\u2019s Eras\nTour invites fans who remembered\nrocking out to \u201cLove Song\u201d and \u201cFearless\u201d\nin the 2000s, as well as younger fans who\nfirst listened to Taylor Swift when she\nreleased \u201cShake it Off\u201d. Safe to say, fans\nof different decades enjoyed the show.\nDespite the diverse age demographic,\nmost attendees were female.\nThe show was a momentous occasion\nfor many fans, who came dressed up in\nthe theme of their favourite era, wearing\ncowboy hats and carrying rows of\nhomemade friendship bracelets on their\narms \u2013 a trend that grew exponentially\ndue a lyric in one of Swift\u2019s songs.\nAt 8pm, the show started with \u201cMiss\nAmericana and The Heartbreak Prince,\u201d\nas the album Lover kicked off the nine\neras.Eachera,definedbyoneortwosister\nalbums was accompanied by a fitting\noutfit alluding to her music videos.\nEach fan was given a free wristband\nwith an attached lightbox, and as such\nthe crowd became one with Swift,\ntransforming into a sea of red during the\nRed era or purple during \u201cFearless\u201d. A\nwhite snake became visible in the crowd\nduring the Reputation era.\nAs in every show, Swift performed\nher acoustic section with her guitar and\npiano, by mashing two songs that had\nfans only guessing hours before the\nshow started. In this instant it became\nclear, that it is not only Swift\u2019s well tuned\nvoice that built her success, but also her\ndedication to the two instruments, and\nthe creative brilliance of her lyrics and\nmelodies.\nAs if in a movie trailer, each era gave\na snapshoft of Swift\u2019s life, jumping\nbetween contrasting themes of fame,\nlove, fun, escapism, independence,\nand struggle. Swift\u2019s newest album The\nTortured Poets Department brought out\na new theme; mental health struggles\nas a consequence of fame and social\nmedia. While she previously explored\nfame during her Reputation album,\nseeing how she set the songs in an the\neerie insane asylum \u2013 built with a metal\nwhite bed and creepy nurses \u2013 brought\nout Swift\u2019s openness to embrace change\nin her style.\nSimilar to Adele, Swift gave her\naudience a show of her best songs, in an\nevening of experiences giving decades of\nmemories and emotions.\ndemonstrated, while she continued\nin her mezzo-soprano (medium,\nfemale) vocals.\nPart time singer, part time\ncomedian\nBetween songs, Adele interacted\nwith her fans, shooting t-shirts into\nthe crowd with a cannon, inviting\nfans on stage for brief interactions,\nand sharing her thoughts, feelings,\nand gratitude. My sister and I\nlaughed when she introduced Skyfall\nby saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get dramatic!\u201d and\nwe let out the occasional \u201caww\u201d\nwhen she talked about her struggles\naround the time she wrote \u201cSomeone\nLike You\u201d.\nEarly in the show, she invited a\nyoung couple from South Africa, who\nhad flown twelve hours to Munich\njust for her performance, on stage\nbecause she loved the girl\u2019s energy.\nHer witty reactions to the girl and her\nboyfriend\u2019s awe-struck comments\nhighlighted her high degree of social\nintelligence and quirky charm \u2013\nqualities that can make an audience\nfall in love with her, and a skill\nevery performer would benefit from\nmastering. Even though she spoke\nonly implicitly about her past, every\nfan who had followed her public\nlife since the release of \u201cChasing\nPavements\u201d in 2008, understood\nwhat she was alluding to. It created a\ntight-knit feeling of belonging.\nIn early September, Adele\nannounced she would take a break\nfrom performing and releasing\nnew music after her final shows in\nLas Vegas in November. However\nshocking it may be, her recent\ninterest in Hollywood may give fans\nthe comfort to see her act on the small\nand large screen.\nHopefully Adele will return to\nthe stage once again \u2013 astonishing\nvoices like hers are rare and precious\nnowadays.\n\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001d\u0017\u001b\u001a\u001d\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0014\u001a\u0012\u0011\u0010\n\u201c\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0019\u0013\u0012\u001c\u001c\u0013\u0019\n\u001b\u0011\u0014\u0019\u001e\u0014\u0019\u0010\u0012\u000f\u000e\u001c\u0012\u001d\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001e\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\u0017\u001c\u001a\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001c\u001a\u0015\u0014\u0019\u0018\u001b\nTaylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour welcomed 85,000 fans\nto Wembley Stadium for a three and a half hour\njawdropping show, and a nostalgic setlist.\nfor many fans, who came dressed up in\nthe theme of their favourite era, wearing\nshow started.
