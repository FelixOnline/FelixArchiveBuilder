    "content": "Sport\nFootball: Cup Final Defeat\nQM C II 1 IC III 0\nIn a scrappy, closely contested match last\nSa:urd a> at Motspur Park. IC III were\nnarrowly defeated by QM C II. The game\nwas dominated' by mid-field stalemate, both\nsides playing 4-1*2. The pick of the chances\nwen: to the opposition. Paul Simpson\nkeeping IC in the hunt several times with a sc'.id performance between the posts.\nDave Lynne was unlucky in the first half\nwhen his flashing shot was turned past the\nr x>>\". Apart from this, few other chances fell\nto Dave or Steve Cussens up front and the\nhalf-time interval arrived with the score still\nA fighting mid-field of Paul Snedker.\nDave Wadsworth. Mark Whitehead and\nAnton Miiner set the pitch alight early in the\nsecond half, but the flames of passion were\ndoused seven minutes from time when an\nunlucky run of the ball in the box ended up\nwith Pau! finally being beaten. Substitute\nMatin Barnes pulled a muscle. Captain\nChns Gordon shouted at everybody but it\nwas all to no avail. The rest of the defence.\nJohn Barden. Bryce Goldborough and\nDave Keliand all contributed to a solid back\nfour performance but in the end the lack of\npenetration was our downfall.\nSpecial thanks to our most loyal supporter. Sue Matthews, who lasted right\nto the Vindaloo end. and to all the others\nwho came along.\nKings II 1 vs 2 IC II\nA Bill calling for IC 2nds to be awarded\nthe Divisional Cup was passed by a two to\none majority on its First Reading in the\nChamber of Colliers Wood on Saturday.\nThe Final Reading will be on Wednesday 21\nMarch.\nThe debate began with a strong attack\nfrom a Militant King's Left Winger which\ni or ceC Defence spokesman Rob Richards of\nIC to c once ed an early clause. There\nfollowed some heated exchanges and several\ntimes the Speaker was forced to make\ncontroversial interventions. John King from\nthe IC front benches redressed the balance of\nthe proceedings by forcing home a Point of\nOrder. The Speaker called for an immediate\nadjournment.\nAfter the second sitting produced no more\nthan forty-five minutes of filibustering from\nthe King's members, the Speaker agreed to a guillotine under the 2 x ten minute rule.\nDavid Lyunne the IC spokesman on\nEnergy with clear Right Wing tendencies\nleapt to his feet and carried the day with a sweeping attack on an Opposition back-ben cher. In an Amendment Mr Barry Tuzio\ni Independent) called for more Bank\nHolidays and a re-ordering of the days of the\nweek. This left both Whips a little non-plus sed. Nevertheless after a division the\nMotion was carried and the House rose at\n4:45pm.

Holland. Jones\nwas not deterred by the onlookers (or\npursuits). Racing began with a fresh wind\nand freezing conditions, but the two IC\nteams were undeterred by this harsh\nenvironment as they sailed towards victory\nafter victory.\nThe event was sailed in Vauriens\u2014best\ndescribed as a shoe box with a point at the\nfront. IC perfected the art of roll tacking these tubs, while opposition's imitations\nfailed miserably (interesting fact considering\nit was our first experience of these boats).\nEven so. the racing was close and some\nmatches were quite tricky. The tension could\nbe felt both on the bank and on the boats.\nIC's consistent team work pulled us through.\nTostevin's tactic of confusing the opposition\nby altering the start line produced some\namusing results. He managed to sail off with\nthe starting buoy. In another eventful race,\nRobson managed to maintain the team's winning position despite persistent attempts\nat a bad on ing ship, following the trend set by\nJones earlier in the week. Kennedy had\nconsiderable success in a very reluctant\nboat\u2014it stopped still after each tack.\nThe a pre s sail was equally enjoyable and\nwas centred around various pubs/night\nclubs in the town. We delighted the natives\nwith a display of British vigour and managed\nto totally dominate the dance floor in our\nown inimitable style.\nOur windsurfing attempts were less\nsuccessful and our thanks must go to the\nTilburg team for winning our only race. The\nsailing crews should also be mentioned, for\nwithout their continued efforts such excellent results would not have been achieved.\nFinally our two captains\u2014Jones and Bevan\nshould be thanked for leading us to our\nrespective victories.\nWith the weather getting warmer by the day,\nand the smell of freshly mown grass drifting\non the breeze, some of you must be itching to\nget back into your whites, and to hear the\nsound of leather on willow once again. IC\nCricket Club plays on Wednesday and\nSaturday throughout the summer. As well as\nfriendly games, we are entered for the UL U and U AU Knockout competitions.\nWe hope to run three or four XIs, but\nbecause of College'sun civilised behaviour,\nputting our exams in the summer term, we\nneed a very large 'pool' of players.\nIf anyone is interested in playing either all\nseason, or only occasionally, please contact I* Eastland, Chem Eng 3 (Captain) orT Hclsby.\nCiv Eng 3 (Sec), giving playing standard and\ntype (ie bat/bowl/w kt), for further details.\nIndoor 6-a side\nIC3\nset off early Sunday morning to make\ntheir debut in the U AU6 a side (Indoor)\ntournament at Brunei. LSE were dispatched\nwith cons u mate ease (they never arrived!)\nand the team progressed to a straight\nshowdown with Warwick University for a place in the final. IC batted first and, after\nstart by Eastland and Helsby, collapsed.\nJarret managed to steer the side to 122 after\n12 overs, with 42. IC then dismissed\nWarwick for 71 thanks to a sprawling, one-handed catch by Eastland.\nAnd so to the final. IC found themselves\nin the field and some good bowling and tight\nfielding restricted their opponents, UEA, to\n94 runs off their allot ed12 overs. IC\nscornfully breezed to 95 off only 6 overs with\nsome notable performances from Helsby\n(25), Harlow (20) and Jarrett (20).\nIC deserved to win as they provided the\nballs for the tournament (in every sense) and\nthe most competent umpire, Stuart Turner.\nNow the boys must go to Lancaster for the\nfinals on April 2.\nDetective Gregor Booth had been hired by\nthe Wimbledon Wombles to investigate the\ntheft of a horde of badges from Tobermony,\nwho wanted them back to make into a necklace for his lover, Madame Cholet.\nSuspecting a team of West Country womb les, Grego was led to Winslade Park, Exeter.\nPerchance, the final race of the Reebok\nSouthern Universities Cross-Country League\nwas taking place. Our hero ran in it, purely to\navoid suspicion, and finished 25th. He then\nturned to greet the rest of his CID team as\nthey finished the race.\n'Well done Sam,' he said to Sam.\n'Gee thanks, Gregor,' was the reply.\n'Nice run Graham,' he commented.\n'Yeah, thanks,' Graham answered.\n'Well run Rob,' he said to Rob finishing\n51st. 'Well done to you to,' Rob replied.\n'Good one,' Gregor said to Dave Evans as\nhe finished last.\n'Piss off, you pear-faced bastard scum-bag,' spluttered Dave casually.\nIn the end it was all too easy for our hero\ndetective. Hundreds of badges were given out\nat the prize ceremony afterwards. Imperial\nCollege took home six for being the best\noverall college team. They won't be returned\nto Tobermony.\nDon't forget the Hyde Park Relay is\ntomorrow at 2:30pm. Friday, May 4, 1984] I FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "I't t f ii it; Untie\nby Dr Bernard Lamb\nAn extract from The Phoenix 1984.\nThe writer turned over in bed, torn between composing\nthe next dramatic sentence of his novel and the subtler lures\nof sleep. Just as his subconscious formed the phrase:\n\"There was a pregnant pause...\" his mind relaxed into sleep.\nThe thought was trapped where it was formed in his brain,\ndeep in the word-generating convolutions of the cortex.\nSwiftly, the denizens of the verbal underworld pounced on\nit.\n\"Have you heard?\" hissed the quotation mark.\n\"Heard what?\" asked her partner at the other end.\n\"About the pause. The pause is pregnant!\"\n\"Well! Well!\" cried the exclamation mark. \"Whatever\nnext!\"\n\"What I'm in a terrible hurry to know,\" panted the dash,\n\"is who did it\u2014who's the wicked father-to-be?\"\n\"You can stop looking at me,\" said the dot dot dot dot. \"I 'll\nadmit I often insinuate, but I never inseminate. Maybe one of\nthe parentheses did it...They always seem to need a suitably\ncurved partner.\"\n\"You're asking for a punch up the bracket,\" retorted the\nparenthesis. \"We need a suitable partner, yes, but no one\ncould say a pause was a possible par nter for a parenthesis.\nAnyway, how do you know the pause is pregnant?\"\n\"I can answer that,\" replied the full stop gravely. \"The\npause missed her period twice, and that's a most serious\nmatter.\"\n\"Well, I didn't do it,\" said the colon. \"I was feeling much\ntoo turgid when the pause must have conceived, though I feel a new man since my irrigation. It could have been the\nsolidus who did it: we all know he has his inclinations.\"\n\"You're doubly dotty to accuse me, colon,\" replied the\nsolidus. \"After all, I'd only just had a stroke.\"\n\"Yes, but stroking whom'\" chipped in a kinky comma.\n\"Look up there!\" indicated the caret.\nThey looked\u2014and saw that a question mark hung over\nthem all.\n\"Which of you made the improper lias on?\" it asked.\n\"Not I,\" replied the ampersand, curling its curves tighter\nand hugin g its tail. \"I was only briefly standing in for AND. Perhaps it was the hyphen\u2014always trying to cut a bit of a dash and link up with anything in sight.\"\n\"Thank you, but I'm a hyphen, not a low ph en,\" came the\ndignified reply.\n\"I don't believe that any of us respectable punctuation\nmarks would ravish a pause,\" said the semicolon. \"After all,\nmost of us put a stop to things or at least come in in the\nmiddle; we don't usually start things on our own. It's far\nmore likely that one of those words did if.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the apostrophe, \"it must've been that horrid\nlittle word OF. Not only is he terribly possessive, but he\nfrequently has tendencies that can only be described as pro-genitive.\"\n\"Of course it wasn't me,\" replied OF indignantly. \"It was\nfar more likely to be you, apostrophe, always hanging\naround those sinuous s' s \u2014might easily go for a pause, too.\"\nThis reply made the apostrophe so cross that he was\nalmost beside himself with rage, looking more and more like\nan umlaut every minute. Pairs of 'acutes' and 'graves'\ntwittered in foreign accents, looking like sets of raised\neyebrows beside the from of the circumflex. The cedilla\nsoftened gently under the sea.\n\"We're all getting nowhere,\" snapped the asterisk. \"We\nstill haven't identified the *ing villain who *ed the pause. My guess is that INTO done it. He's always trying to proposition\nthings.\"\n\"All right, so I take the accusative,\" said INTO, \"but I can't simultaneously be dative or genitive.\"\n\"He's got a case there\u2014several in fact,\" remarked the\nablative absolute, \"so we must see that his case goes to the\nright court.\"\n\"That's easy,\" pointed out a rather demonstrative pro-noun. \"It all depends on the type of word. If it's lower case, it\ngoes to the lower court; if it's upper case, it goes to the\nhigher court, where it can be sentenced to capital punish-ment.\"\n\"I don't think a preposition would proposition a pause into\npregnancy,\" remarked INTO. \"It's far more likely to have\nbeen a verb: they're always doing things, not just showing\nothers the way.\"\n| \"Don't blame me,\" said WAS DONE. \"I 've been in a I passive mood for ages! The guilty party must have been in\n| an active mood, like FORCE.\" FORCE looked threateningly at WAS DONE.\n\"No!\" he shouted. \"Force, forced. See, I'm only a weak\nverb.

    "content": "The National Union of Students (NUS) held its Easter\nConference at Hull during the vacation. Imperial College\nsent two visitors, Hugh Stiles (RCC Chairman) and David\nRowe (Publications Board Chairman), who report here on\ntheir findings.\nThe annual NUS Conference at Christmas chiefly\nconsidered the report and plan for next year, whereas the\nEaster Conference debates policy and the financial\nestimates. In addition the hustings and elections for the\nmajor Union posts are held at this time.\nThe Conference was held in Hull's City Hall, and was\nattended by about 1,500 delegate students from ail over\nthe country. The first impression that anyone gets at the\nConference is that NUS is still an intensely political\nanimal. The presence of the student groups such as the\nNational Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS), and\nthe Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) was very\nevident. At caucuses, held between Conference sessions,\nthey exerted a great influence on the voting behaviour of\ndelegates. Despite this, however, the proceedings were\nvery democratic and every attempt is made to allow any\ndelegate, whatever their politics, to have their say.\n\"Together we are\nstrong\" says Stewart\nOpening Address\n\"Whether you like it or not, the public\nrecognises the NUS.\" With this quote Neil\nStewart opened the NUS Conference. And\ndelegates were stunned to learn that these\nwords came from none other than John\nSelwyn Gummer, chairman of the\nConservative party. Stewart went on to warn\nus of something that we were soon to find out\nfor ourselves. The delegations to NUS Conference contain \"small groups of\nunrepresentative dogmatists\". \"The new\nleaders of the FCS,\" we were told, \"toy with\nracism, sexism, ignorance and prejudice.\" He\ncriticised the far Right and the far Left for\ntheir politics of fatalism, defeat and despair.\n\"We will stand against them, we will defeat\nthem as we did in the past,\" bellowed Stewart\nto rapturous applause.\nThe President made special mention of the\n\"New Deal Campaign' which calls for every\nstudent to be treated as an independent adult.\nHe said that this would be the centre-piece of\nthe conference.\nThe President ended his stirring address on\nan optimistic note. He said that NUS was\nstronger now than for many years. It had\nrouted all diss affiliations( for the simple\nreason that NUS is now democratic) and\nenjoyed a high standing with the public and\nmembers alike.\nPage 6\\JMWkWkWHtkWMWMkWB^SBBMM\nNeil Stewart, retiring President of the\nNational Union of Students.\nWkWBMWFriday, May 4, 1 9 S4H HH Motions\n-the great\npolicy debate\nThe motions debated at Easter were the\nmost important part of the Conference,\nsince they determine the policy of the\nNUS.\nOf the hundreds of motions proposed,\nonly seven are 'prior it is ed' for debate. Most\nof these are of immediate concern to\nstudents; others affect society as a whole.\nMotion on Further Education\nThe NUS condemned the Government's white paper 'Training for Jobs'. The motion\non Further Education was critical of the\ncentralised control of FE and pointed out\nthat the White Paper does nothing to tackle\nunemployment, challenge the crisis in FE and\nexpand opportunities for training and\neducation. Further Education Colleges now\naccount for more than 50<7c of the NUS membership.\nThe increasing influence of FE colleges was\nevident in some parts of the motion,\nencouraging a concentration of resources in\nthe FE sector within the NUS.

    "content": "News ran HH RM Hi Government Cuts Travelling and Housing Slashed\nThe Easter vacation has seen two sources of bad news for students'\nfinancial position. Firstly, the beginning of April saw the implementation\nof the government's cuts to the troublesome Housing Benefit scheme\nwhich will reduce term time benefits for many students; and secondly, on\n4 April Sir Keith Jospeh announced the forthcoming changes in the grant\narrangements for meeting students' travel costs. Both these changes will\nparticularly hit students in London where rents are high and where many\nstudents are forced to live some distance from their colleges.\n1. Housing Benefit\nDuring the Easter vacation the 'Unified Housing Benefit' system\ncelebrated its first birthday. Since the scheme came into full operation\nlast April, it has dragged the benefits network to new depths of chaos\nand disrepute and has hoisted severe financial hardship on some of the\npoorest members of the community.\nNow the government have decided to mark the anniversary of the\nscheme's birth by imposing more cuts onto an already inadequate\nsystem. The draft proposals for the changes, announced in the\ngovernment's autumn statement, were greeted with severe public\ncriticism which forced a re-think of the strategy. However, the final\nproposals, announced on 6 February, made no substantial alterations\nbut naively attempted to defuse opposition simply by delaying the\nimplementation of some of the cuts until November 1984. Although\nthis delay and confusion within hard-pressed local authorities who are\nnow faced with having to implement two sets of complex changes in\nthe regulations, with the resultant administrative chaos, in both April\nand November.\nThe April changes are designed to reduce benefits for those with\nincomes above the government's 'Needs Allowance' figure and that\nun fortuna t ly means term time rebates for many students will be\naffected. Thus many of you will not have been delighted to find a letter\nawaiting your return for the new term informing you of the amount by\nwhich your benefit has been reduced. Particularly hit will be students\nreceiving rare rebates during term time, and those who have extra\nincome above their grant eg sponsorships, scholarships etc. Average\nterm time losses should be around \u00a31.00 per week so if you seem to\nhave lost much more than that it could be worth checking the figures\nwith the Student Services. Luckily vacation rebates should not be\naffected (this time) apart from the extra delays the changes will cause.\n2. Grants and Travelling Expenses\nOn the 11 November 1983 Sir Keith Joseph announced that the main\nrates of student grants would be increased by 4% from Autumn 1984.\nThus, the main rates of grant for 1984/5 will be:\nStudents studying in London \u00a32,100\nStudents studying elsewhere \u00a3 1,775\nStudents living at home \u00a31,435\nAt that time the Education Secretary also indicated that plans were\nafoot to review the arrangements for the reimbursement of student\ntravel expenses. The results of this review were duly announced in the\nHouse of Commons on 4 April 1984.\nAt present there is an element of \u00a350 per year included in the student\ngrant towards travelling cot sts. In addition, students are entitled to\nclaim back any extra amounts they spend above \u00a350 on daily traveling\ncosts to College and on 3 return journeys to their parental home. From\nSeptember 1984 all this will change. The flat rate of \u00a350 included in the\ngrant will be raised to \u00a3100 which is good news for those students\nwhose travel costs are below \u00a3100. However for those with higher\ntravel costs the news is that you will no longer be able to reclaim\nmonies above the flat rate unless your travel costs exceed \u00a3250. This\nmeans that all those students whose travel costs are bet wen \u00a3100 and\n\u00a3250 will have to meet the excess out of their own pockets. Needless to\nsay this will particularly discriminate against students for who it may\nbe unrealistic to seek alternative accommodation partway through\ntheir courses to take account of the changed regulations. These\nstudents will be allowed to claim reimbursement of any costs above\n\u00a3150 although this will still leave them having to meet any deficit\nbe we en \u00a3 100 in their grants and \u00a3 150 above which they can claim, from\ntheir own pockets.\n'Summer Letting'\nVacation Work\nINTRODUCTION\nLast year there was a major re-organisation of the way in which many\nof the College's residences are dealt with during the summer vacation.\nIn the past, many rooms were left empty during the long vacation.\nLast summer, however, effective organisation and marketing resulted\nin all residences maintaining high occupancy levels throughout this\nperiod and the income which we produced was more than double that\nof any previous years.\nAlthough marketing is carried out centrally the letting schemes are\nmanaged by teams of students who are responsible for almost all\naspects of management from keeping financial records to cleaning the\nrooms.\nTHE JOBS\nEach scheme will be operated by Assistant Managers and cleaners and\nthere will be a Co-or d in at or who has overall responsibility for the\nschemes as a whole. The Assistant Manager's job is hard to define since\nit requires a willingness to do whatever is required.\nAt the beginning of the scheme the main task is to clean the rooms\nready for the summer guests and set up an office. As soon as the\nletting s start, vast numbers (we hope) of guests will arrive. This will\ninvolve handing out keys, taking money and dealing with a lot of\nenquiries from guests. This period tends to be incredibly hectic calling\nfor considerable stamina and patience to cope with the volume of work\nand the long hours.\nAfter the initial period the job settles into a routine of taking new\nbookings, collecting rent and maintaining a high standard of service\nand cleaning. At the end of the scheme, all the rooms have to be\nprepared for the returning students.\nThe volume of work is high throughout the summer, but there is a great deal of variety and it offers an unique opportunity to gain\nmanagement experience on an exciting and challenging project.\nFor those of you who are looking for a slightly less demanding\nsummer, there are a number of vacancies for cleaners. Although the\nwork is mainly concerned with cleaning rooms, changing linen and\nshowing guests to their rooms, it is a chance to work as part of a team\nin a lively environment.\nTHE SCHEMES\nEvelyn Gardens\nThis is the largest of the schemes with around 400 beds to fill.\nThere are eight cleaners.\nDuties include running a small continental breakfast service.\nHamlet Gardens\nInitially we are looking for three assistant managers. Traditionally the\nmanagers at Hamlet have done the cleaning themselves in order to\nincrease their earnings. We will need to discuss this possibility with the\nnew managers before deciding on cleaners. Hamlet Gardens offers\naccommodation for over 200 guests which includes some specially\nequipped flats for families.\nBeit Hall\nBeit Hall is being included in the summer letting scheme for the first\ntime this year. We need one assistant manager here whose job will be to\nassist the housekeeper in all aspects of the scheme's management.\nRemuneration\nThe basic wage for assistant managers is \u00a380pw plus free\naccommodation and a bonus at the end of the scheme.\nWe can offer cleaners \u00a3 1.70 per hour, plus free accommodation with\na minimum of twenty-four hours work per week and opportunities for\nworking additional hours.\nApplication forms for all these jobs (together with the answers to\nany questions that you might have) are available from Student\nServices.\nThe closing date for applications is 18 May.\nPage 4 \\ Friday.

Since then detailed\ndiscussions have taken place\nbetween the College and the\nUnion to iron out the details.\nUnion Deputy PResident Christine Teller said she felt that\nthe Union had made its case well\nand felt confident that approval\nfor the takeover will be given on\nTuesday.\nPorn Rumpus\nAn allegedly pornographic story\nhas overshadowed the launch of\nIC's literary magazine, The\nPhoenix.\nThe magazine went on sale for\nthe first time on Wednesday this\nweek.

Mr Newman is,\nironically, better known for his\noutspoken campaign against\npornography on the College\ncampus.\n\"The story does contain\nshocking and disgusting things,\nand things that degrade women,\"\nsaid Mr Newman. \"I wasn't careful enough when writing the\nstory.

She has accepted a job in Graphic Design\n(her original qualification) and thoroughly enjoying her new job. We all wish her the best of luck and many thanks for all she has done for ICU.\nUnion Refectory.\nAt the end of last term College were considering radical changes to the\nUnion Lower Refectory. IC Union put the proposal to College that the\nUnion manage the Lower Refectory. We have been compiling information on\nsimilar refectory outlets since last August. The proposal has been\ndiscussed with Simon Perry,Refectory Committee Chairman and John Smith,\nCollege Secretary. The last issue of Felix gave a misleading impression\nregarding whether or not the decision for ICU to manage the refectory had\nbeen taken. The decision has not been taken yet. We will be continuing\nthe discussions on Tuesday 1st May. I expect a final decision to be\ntaken at this meeting, and then if a favourable decision is made, the\nproposal taken to the Rector's Policy Committee on May8 th.I will report\nverbally at the U GM the outcome of the various meetings. If College ever\nmanage to make a decision.\nStudent Residence.\nTogether with representatives from the Hall and House Wardens I have\ncompiled a report noting all the outstanding aspects of the Lauwerys\nResidence Report and any unsatisfactory aspects of the recent decisions\ntaken regarding student residence. This report will be discussed at the\nStuden*. Residence Committee on Wednesday 2nd May, as will the student rents\nfor next year. I will report any decisions taken verbally at the UGM.\nI:; COST.\nSteve Bishop was unable to attend the INGOST 198M Conference, and so\nJoanna Claydor accompanied Jim Boucher to Helsinki to represent IC. I approached the Rector asking for financial help with travelling costs for\ntae delegates, which he agreed to do. The Conference was extremely success-ful, the delegates are expected to give a full report to next Council. One\nof t ne outcomes of the Conference was the suggestion that IC host INCOST\n1535. At present Iam looking into the feasibility of hosting INCOST 1985,\ntrie subject of which will be Biotechnology, and will be discussing the issue\nwit ft College on Wednesday. Anyone interested in helping please come and see\n.\n'\n.\n\"\nv'S Conference.\nFollowing the last decision at aUG M to send observers to NUS Conference,\nLaveftoweand Hugh Stiles represented IC at the Easter Conference in Hull.\nThey intend to report their impressions both in Felix and at the next\nCouncil.\nTransport.\nDue to a re-vamping of present transport booking procedures, I have been\nnegotiating deals with some local hire companies so that vans may be hired\nat lower rates than present commercial charges. At present two companies\nlook promising.\nPresident's Report/continued...\n7. Southside Gym and Central Laundrette.\nThe Southside Gym is now complete! The Central Laundrette, as far as Iam aware is incomplete, however, Iam assured the completion is imminent.\n8. Security.\nAt the end of last term several meetings were held between the Chairman of\nthe Student Residence Committee, Estates, the Security Officer, the Southside Wardens and myself, to discuss security in the Southside Halls. Due\nto the costs of security and messenger personnel being transferred onto the\nresidence account, a new system of messenger and security manning was\nproposed - to reduce costs and in order to maintain a high level of security,\nchanges to the Southside Entrances were proposed. The work has been started\nand should have been completed for the beginning of term - however, it is\nbehind schedule! The proposed system is a set of double doors on both\nentrances, the outer being on an ASSA key system, the inner on a key card\nsystem. The entrances may also be monitored by a TV camera.\n9. House Wardens and Head Tenancy Managers.\nAm umber of wardens and head tenancy managers are leaving at the end of this\nacademic session. Anyone interested in applying for such positions should\nobtain an application form from the IC Union Office. The deadline for\napplications is Monday 21st May198 U. DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO UGM.\n1. Travel Centre.\nA three way contract has been signed between the Union, College and STA\nenabling STA to trade at Imperial under the banner 'UL'J Travel at IC*.\nThe travel centre is being installed in the North West corner of the JCR\non the site of the old bar counter and should be open by the second week\nof this term. The office will be open normal office hours during terra\nand will provide a full range of travel services though Railcards will not\nbe available.\n2. Self Defence.\nWe are still waiting for the Metropolitan Police to set a date for the self\ndefence course jt Imperial (these are heavily in demand!). It is unlikely\nthat we will be able to run a course this term but Iam optimistic about\nbeing able to offer a course in October. Notes have been circulated to all those who showed an interest in the course and I will continue to collect\nnames and notify people further when a date is set.\n3. Estimates of Expenditure 84/85.\nThe Union Estimates are now being churned through the College system and I will not know until later in May the outcome. We will be discussing\nestimates at UFC on the 22nd May (note changed date) following the College\nFinance and Exec meeting.\n4. Bars.\nYou will probably have noticed that the prices of draught products have\nchanged. Most have gone down despite the Budget increase of 2p3p per\npint. Iam now looking at other product areas and hope to see further\nprice decreases particularly in spirits.\nThe guest beers for this month are Burton in the Union and one of Flowers\nor Springfield in Southside. We have introduced Castlemaine lager into\nour range.\n5. Refectories.\nYou will already have read that we have approached College about the\npossibility of taking over the Union Refectory and a decision should have\nbeen made by the time of this meeting.\nWe have also continued to press for firmer control and better management\nof College Refectories. However, a discussion at the last meeting of\nRefectory Committee about the targets for individual outlets - whether\nprofitable outlets should subsidize unprofitable outlets was considered\ninappropriate by the Chairman leaving me to wonder exactly what Refectory\nCommittee is there for. It still seems that administrators condone gross\nmismanagement rather than have to introduce change.\n6. Trnasport. \u2022\nWe have sold OB W and are presently awaiting delivery of the new van which\nwill be a17 seater, we are also setting a discount arrangement with one of\nthe major van hire companies.\nAfter much discussion at the end of the last term we have agreed on a new\nmembership and format for Transport Committee which will be similar to\nUnion Finance Committee. After the constitution has been approved by\nCouncil the revamped committee should start work by the end of this term.\nRETURNING OFFICER'S REPORT.\nThe following elections will take place at the UGM:1. Haldane Book Buyer.\n2. Haldane Recore Buyer.\n3. Felix Business Manager.\n1\n4\n. ICU Publicity Officer.\n5-7. 3 Ordinary Members Union House Committee\n8-11. 4 Delegates to GUC.\n12-13. 2 Ordinary Members of Union Council.\nPapers for the above elections will be taken down at 5.30pm on Wednesday 9th May. Nominations must be fully proposed and seconded by then.\n\n"

A team of six students will spend\nnearly three months pioneering\nnew routes in the Andes and\ncarrying out scientific work in\nfields such as meter ology and\ngeology.\nThe volcano, El Altar, rises to\na height of 5,465m and is\nregarded as one of the most\nspectacular and challenging\npeaks in South America. The\nteam hopes to make the first\nBritish ascent of Obispo, the\nhighest peak of El Altar.\nThe group will be giving a presentation in College next\nsession on the outcome of the\nexpedition. They are being sponsored by IC Exploration Board,\nWH Smith, Waitrose, Woolworths and NatWest Bank.\nThe expedition is also being\nhelped by IC Bookshop, Sherfield Refectory and the Health\nCentre. A raffle is presently being\nheld as the latest in a series of\nfund raising efforts by the team.\nElectronic Locks Delayed NEWS IN\nBRIEF The College has set up a new\nCentre for Composite Materials\nto co-ordinate research and\nexpertise in this important and\nexpanding area of engineering.\nThe Centre will be a central point\nof contact in the College for\nindustrial users of such materials.\nThe Maths department has\nformed a Mathematical Advice\nCentre to co-ordinate its\nconsultancy to staff and research\nstudents in other departments.\nThe College has raised a total of\n\u00a37,655,915 in research contracts\nthis session up to March from a total of 229 projects.\nTwo IC students attended the\nInternational Conference of\nStudents in Science and\nTechnology( IN COST) in\nHelsinki during the vacation.

The locks will\nbe magnetic, operated by a small\nkey-card, the size of a key fob,\nwhich will be issued to each\nresident.\nThe new security/ system will\ninvolve two sets of doors on each\nentrance. The outer doors will be\nas at present, opened by the\nresidents' room keys. Inside there\nwill be a second set of doors\noperated by the magnetic cards.\nThe Selkirk/Keogh entrance already has two sets of doors, but\nthe Tizard/Falmouth entrance at\npresent only has one set. Work\nhas recently begun on the installation of a second set inside the\npresent doors.\nThe reason for the delay is\nproblems with the matching of\nthe magnetic device with the\nCollege'sASS A locks. When\nfitted there was a gap between the\ndevice and the door which would\nhave allowed the lock to be\ninterfered with. The company\nsupply ik ng the magnetic devices,\nCor Keys, has now solved this\nproblem and is expected to\ndemonstrate the modi fide d device to the College this week.\nGeoffrey Reeves, College\nSecurity Officer, told FELIX that he hoped the new locks\nwould be installed later this term.\nHe said no decision had yet been\ntaken on the hours when the\ndoors would he locked with the\nnew locks. At present the doors\nare locked at 7:00pm every night.\nFalse Alarm Southside residents were kept\nawake for two hours from\n4:00am Wednesday morning due\nto a fault in the Southside fire\nalarm system. This is the latest of\na series of false alarms since the\ninstallation of the \u00a3100,000\nsystem.\nWednesday's false alarm was\ndue to a faulty detector going off\nspontaneously. The source could\nnot be located from the central\nmonitoring board and an\nengineer had to be called in\nduring the night to fix the system.\nThe alarm went off in term it tant ly for two hours as each detector\nwas tested to locate the fault. The\nmain Southside security desk was\nflooded with calls from angry\nSouthside residents who had\nbeen woken by the disturbance.\nIn a letter to the Estates section\nDr Henry Hutchinson, Warden\nof Selkirk and Tizard Halls has\nexpressed concern about the\nfrequency of the false alarms and\nthe fact that people are now\nignoring the alarm.\nFire and Safety Officer Mr Bob\nFog gon said that smoke\ndetectors in kitchens were being\nreplaced by less sensitive heat\ndetectors and that although the\nsystem's teething troubles were\nnot completely ironed out the\n'battle was being won'.\nThe new system has been in\noperation for four weeks and was\ninstalled to bring the Southside\nHalls in line with the fire\nregulations contained in the 1971\nHotel Accommodation Act.\nAlthough the Act does not cover\nstudent accommodation the\nCollege have been forced to\ninstall the new system because of\nthe increased letting of the Halls\nas Hotel accommodation over\nthe summer. Since then the\nsystem has gone off several times\nduring the Easter vacation,\nmainly due to over sensitive\nsmoke detectors in the kitchens.\nSERVICING & REPAIRS\nat\nRICKY'S GARAGE( Personal service guaranteed.)\nI* QUEENS GATE PLACE MEWS,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON.\nLONDON S.W.7 Tel : 01-581 ISM\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 BH H Page\nFriday, May 4, 1984\n\n"

    "content": "Vacancies for Head Tenancy Managers\nTHE WARDEN\nThe Warden is based at Hamlet\nGardens and a self-contained flat\nis available which would be\nsuitable for a single person or for\na couple.\nThe Warden is responsible for\nthe management of Hamlet\nGardens, the largest of the head\ntenancies (see below for what this\ninvolves) but is also responsible\nfor general issues in all of the\nhead tenancies and arranges\nmeetings with the head tenancy\nmanagers where these issues can\nbe discussed. The Warden\nrepresents the head tenancy\nmanagers on the Students'\nResidence Committee. The ideal\ncandidate for this role would be a postgraduate student with at\nleast two years left at College.\nTHE MANAGERS\nThe accommodation which is\navailable for the managers is\nnormally only suitable for a single person.\nThe manager's role can be\nconsidered under three headings:\n1. Domestic\nBefore residents move in the\nmanager is resp on sibi le for\nmaking a note of the readings on\nall gas and electricity meters, so\nthat any bill sent to students can\nbe verified. The manager is\nresponsible for checking-residents in at the beginning of\nthe session and giving out keys.\nThroughout the term, various\ndomestic supplies such as bin\nbags, cleaning materials and light\nbulbs are required. The manager\nis responsible for obtaining these\nfrom the College Stores.\nIn those head tenancies where\ncleaners are employed the\nmanager should ensure that this\nis properly carried out.\nThe landlord is usually\nresponsible for the majority of\nrepairs but because repairs cost \u2022\nmoney, a manager will soon learn\nAlthough managing a head tenancy involves a certain amount of hard\nwork, the main requirement is an interest in Residence and a commitment to making your head tenancy a success\u2014socially, administratively and\nfinancially.\nWe are currently looking for two managers for Lexham Gardens, one\n\u2022 for Hamlet Gardens and one for 8 Earls Court Square who wo\u00bbld take\nover at the beginning of next session.\nWe are also looking for a Warden who will have responsibilities in\nrespect of all the head tenancies.\nto detect just the slightest hint of\nreluctance in the landlord's manner when the question . of\nrepairs is mentioned. Nevertheless, it is the manager's job to\nreport defects to the landlord and\nencourage him to rectify them.\nAt the beginning of each\nsession managers should collect a list of all existing defects. This is\npartly to prevent the new tenants\nbeing blamed for damage caused\nby the previous occupants.\n2. Finance\nThe manager is responsible for\ncollecting the bills and bill\nreminders from Student Services\nand delivering them to the\nstudents. Prompt action is\nessential in this area. Managers\nare also expected to chase up\noutstanding Bills.\nIn some head tenancies,\nmanagers have to empty gas,\nelectricity and telephone meters.\nOccasionally at the beginning\nof session, the managers collect\nany unpaid deposits as students\nmove in.\n3. Social and Discipline\nMuch of the head tenancy\naccommodation is in the form of\nflats, which tend to generate their\nown social life. Others are more\nlike Student Houses where it is\nvery important to give the lead in\norganising social ever'..'.\nIn all the head tenancies the\nmanager is responsible for\nmaking sure that no nuisance is\ncaused to neighbours and that no\nOver b reo thing is\nDANGEROUS\nMost swimmers know that tak nga to t of deep b tea th sw rtl enable them to sw,m further underwater Some do not know, however, that this is a potentially rat al practice.

Managers need\nto have a weekly 'clinic' where\nresidents can report defects and\nwhen other matters can be dealt\nwith.\nAlthough this description\nmakes being a manager look like\na full time job, in fact it is not as\nbad as it sounds.\nMost things only have to be\ndone once or twice a term and are\nnot particularly time consuming.\nNevertheless, these jobs involve a high degree of resp on sib lit y and\ncommitment and if you are\nthinking of applying you will\nneed to talk to your personal\ntutor or supervisor before doing\nso..\nThe work tends to be\nconcentrated into specific\nperiods such as the beginning of\nterm (particularly the first term).\nExperience has shown that\nresearch students find it easier to\nreconcile the management role,\nwith their academic work.\nThe job can be demanding at\ntimes. Student Services is able to\nhelp with many problems, but the\nmanager is often left to his/her\nown devices.\nNevertheless, it provides an\nexcellent opportunity for anyone\nwho is interested in Residence to\ndevelop administrative and management skills.\nIf you are interested, and\nwould like to discuss what the job\ninvolves in more detail, please\ncome to see me in Student\nServices.\nApplication forms are\navailable from the Students'\nUnion Office and must be\nreturned to the students union by\nMonday 21 May.\nMichael Arthur\nStudent Services\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\nMidsummer Dinner& Dance Thursday17 May Melon\nHam Cornets\nChicken Chaudfroid\nPotato, Rice, Tomato & Green Salad\nFresh Fruit Salad\nor\nBlack Forest Gateaux\nCoffee\nPlus: one glass of wine on arrival.

    "content": "Motion on Disabled Students\nThe Conference voted to campaign against\ndiscrimination towards disabled students.\nThere was a call for integrated education for the disabled, and improved access 1\n0\nbuildings in schools and colleges.\nAn amendment condemning the NUS campaign \"Students with Disabilities' as\nbeing under-staffed, under-funded and\nunder-prior it is ed was defeated.\nGreater participation in Union affairs by\ndisabled students was encouraged. At the\nsame time, the setting up of a \"Social Policy\nGroup' for disabled students was\nrecommended.\nSen Deal Motion\nThe NUS \"New Deal for Students\" campaign\nreplaces the old Grants and Cuts campaigns.\nConference called for opposition to all cuts\nin all educational sectors. The general theme\nof the debate was the in sistance that students\nshould be treated as independent adults and\nnot as children living away from home. A set\nof right wing counter proposals, suggesting\nthat NUS should \"'mind its own business\"\nwere heavily defeated.\nAlong with the main motion a call for\nbetter lecturer training was passed.\nLaw. Civil Liberties and the Police Bill\nThe Conference voted to campaign against\nthe Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, but\nrejected more radical moves which would\nhave included non-cooperation with the\nPolice.\nAll the hard left proposals were heavily\ndefeated during the debate. The Union was\nmandated to write, however, to Mr Leon\nBrittan. the Home Secretary, calling for the\nimmediate withdraw) of the bill.\nThe motion, approved overwhelmingly by\nConference, said that the bill would lead to a lack of trust between the Police and the\ncommunity.\nFinancing and Ultra-Vires\nConference passed the motion condemning\nthe fact that student union auto mon y and\nfinancing were being increasingly subject to\nattack. This particularly impinged on the\nability of student unions to make pay ents to\noutside bodies (ultra-vire s). A more extreme amendment, advocating\nillegal payments by student unions, was\ndefeated.\nRacism and Fascism\nIn a heated debate on racism and fascism.\nConference voted that anyone who was a declared racist of fascist should be banned\nunder the NUS policy of ' No Platform',\nwhich should be rigorously upheld.\nThere was some debate about who should\ndecide who were racists and fascists and who\nwere not. A right wing motion calling for\nfreedom of speech for all, including racists\nand fascists, was heavily defeated.\nNational Health Service\nA motion concerning the principle of free,\nuniversal health care for all was passed by\nConference. In addition, the nationalisation\nof the pharmaceutical industry, and the\nabolition of all private medical care was\ncalled for.\nFELixWmmwmammmmmauummmmummm\nEmergency Motion\nOf the emergency motions proposed, ranging\nfrom discipline of students. Sarah Tisdale.\nVA'I on tak ca wav food and Travel Grants,\nthe following were selected:\n1. 7 ravel Cjrants\n2. Miner's dispute\n3. Rugbv tour of South Africa\n4. Liverpool City Council (not debated\ndue to lack of time)\nThe Government's announced intention to\nreplace the present travelling expenses\nscheme with a flat rate payment was strongly\ncondemned in the first emergency motion.\nAnd the Government's policy was again\ncondemned in a debate on the miner's strike,\na debate of little direct relevance on students.\nA proposal for an ultra-vire s payment to the\nminers strike fund .was defeated however.\nSporting links with South Africa were\ncondemned, and there was a call for the spirit\nof the Gleneagle's agreement to be upheld.\nElections\n-Labour\nmaintain hold\nElections\nIn the election for President of the NUS Phil\nWoolas (Labour) narrowly defeated Jane\nTaylor (Left Alliance). The Labour majority\nwas slashed from 319 last year to only 26 this\nyear, an indication of the increasing influence\nof the broad-based Left Alliance grouping.\nThe National Organisation of Labour\nStudents (NOLS) held all the posts they\nwanted and therefore kept their grip on the\nexecutive for the third year running.\nOf the seventeen members of the National\nExecutive for next year eight are Labour, four\nare Left Alliance, one is Socialist, two are\nIndependent, one is Conservative and one is\nSDP.\nPhil Woolas, the newly elected\nPresident of NUS, prepares for the\nyear's journey ahead of him.\nmm mm ww Friday, May 4,1984 a mw mw m Guest\nSpeakers\nGuest Speakers\nThe speakers nominated were:\n1.

An Iranian student\nOf these, the first six were invited to s pei> as a result of the ballot held.\nPeter Heathfield and the rank and fin\nminer predictably spoke out against the\nGovernment's policy of pit closures and\nredundancies. Both of these speakers were\nvery popular with most of the delegates anc\nreceived standing ovations.\nConclusions\nThe main arguments put forward in recent\nyears against IC's re-affiliation to NUS have\ncentred around politics, democracy and\nmoney. It has been said that NL'S is too left\nwing, undemocratic and too expensive. The\npolitical complexion of the Conference, and\ntherefore the NUS. is moving towards centre-rather than far-left, since del gates are now\nelected by cross-campus ballots. The cost of\nre-affiliation would be \u00a315.000 which is about\n6% of the Union's budget. One must consider\nwhat \u00a315.000 means to IC Union. It could\nmean new vans, new sabbaticals or new clubs\nand societies. It could also mean membership\nof the NUS coupled with a leaner look to IC\nUnion. With our \u00a315,000 the NL'S could\nafford to take on two new members of staff\nand thereby possibly provide services of\ngreater value to IC. We could not be sure of\nthis.\nOne thing, however, is sure. Join NUS or\nnot, IC cannot afford to continue to plough\nan independent furrow, mindless of the\nintolerable divisions that exist in student\nsociety today, and which threaten to\nundermine our future, our jobs and the future\nof education in Britain.\nHand on heart, we cannot say that re-affiliation to NUS could give a big.\nindependently minded College like IC. value\nfor money. But on moral grounds, if none\nother, we must look to align ourselves with\nthe aims and policies of the National Union\nand to seek closer links with other colleges\n(especially in the London area). To use a phrase from Conference: 'Together, we are\nstrong.\" Think about it.\n\n"
