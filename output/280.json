Gone are the\nmass Freshers' lunches with\nhundreds of overwhelmed\nfirst year undergraduates\ncrammed together to eat in\nutter confusion.\nThis year, after today's undergraduate Freshman's Reception in the Royal Geographical Society Hall, the\nfresher s will go to their Departments for an introductory talk (11.15 a.m.). After\nbreaking into groups and\nmeeting their tutors, they go\noff to lunch, no special\narrangements having been\nmade. In some cases, it is\nthought that tutors will take\ntheir groups out to eat some-where.\nThe afternoon of Monday\nis free, to enable Freshers to\njoin all the clubs and societies exhibited in the Union\nbuilding on Tuesday, first\nyear Undergraduates start\nthe ' Departmental Induction Procedures', while\nsecond and third year students begin normal classes.\nPostgraduate Freshmen\nare left to hang about the\nCollege until 6.0 p.m. when\nthere is a reception for them\nin the College block ground\nfloor dining-room.\nAll students must register\nby filling in a Registration\nform, and returning it to the\nRegistry on Level 3 in the\nCollege Block. The three registration days are Monday,\nTuesday and Wednesday of\nthis week. Where applicable,\nUndergraduates may collect\ntheir L.E.A. grant cheques\nfrom the Registry at the\nsame time.\nLODGINGS\nSHORTAGE\nThe number of lodgings\non the list of the UL Lodgings bureau has dropped to\nonly 10% of that on last\nyears list. This is largely as\na result of the decision to\ntell landladies that only\nthose who would accept any\nstudent regardless of race\nwould be listed. Accordingly, the bureau is only helping Freshers.\nTo ease the situation,\nICU has compiled a list of\naddresses which may be of\nuse, and Mick Braybrook is\nworking in the Union Office\nhelping people in difficulties.\nAnyone knowing of suitable\naddresses is asked to give\nthem to Mick as soon as\npossible. As one Union\nofficial told FELIX: \"at\nleast this shows that students\nare prepared to make sacrifices in the fight for their\nprinciples \".\nThe Queen to open College Block\nOSCA Appeals\nIn this age of greater\nsocial awareness, it is becoming increasingly obvious\nthat the student can play a significant part in the life of\nthe community in which he\nis so often regarded as a' parasite', or at best a tolerated visitor.\nThe time has come for\nthe Universities and Colleges to give up their roles\nas islands, set apart from\ntheir surrounding environments, from which students\ncan observe the troubles and\nproblems of the people all\naround them from the safety\nof their own private com-m unity. The opportunities\nare there for actual firsthand experience of life and\nthe problems it brings to\nsome people.\nThroughout the country\nstudents are realising their\ngreat potential in the field\nof community service. In\nplaces like Liverpool, Sussex,\nExeter and Hull students are\ninvolved in schemes which\ngive them enjoyment and\nsatisfaction, and also greatly\nbenefit the community of\nwhich they are a part.\nStudent involvement in\nLondon is very low and\nprospective volunteers are\nnot encouraged by the complex network of voluntary\nand statutory organisations\nin this field.\nLondon OSCA organisation for student community\naction exists solely for students in higher education in\nthe Greater London area and\nis run, by students, as a clearing house to put you in\ntouch with the type of job\nyou would like to do. It has\nbeen found necessary to\nemploy four former students\nto spend the amount of time\nthat full-time investigation\nand evaluation demands.\nImperial College has a society for involvement, the\nO.S.S., but even so the possibilities are very varied and\nno College Society can hope\nto do justice to every aspect\nof what is a very wide field.\nOSCA is working for YOU,\nand is here to be used.\nThere is a great deal of\nscope and many of the opportunities would never be\nlisted in a social services\ndirector. These are practical\njobs that benefit people\ndirectly. Some of your time\nat College can be spent in a way that will benefit the\ncommunity and yourself, but\nyou are never tied to a scheme; you are free to do\nas you like at all times.\nIf you would like to help,\nand that's what it comes\ndown to when all's said and\ndone, you can see us at the\nFreshers' Reception, or leave\na note addressed to 'OSCA'\nat the Union office. If you\nwant to come and see us\npersonally, there will always\nbe someone to welcome you\nat:\u2014 28, Woburn Square,\nWC1.

Tel. 969-9491.\nThe mystery guest who\nwill formally open College\nBlock on November 27th will be, it has been revealed,\nthe Queen. Prince Philip, a more frequent visitor to IC,\nwill accompany Her Majesty. The Queen will take tea\nin the Students' common\nroom. The Rector has\nvetoed a suggestion from\nICU President Piers Corbyn\nthat the tea should be open,\nand so only a few selected\nUnion officials will be in vi ted. The Board of Studies\nhas agreed to the suspension\nof lectures on that day.\nOn the left, our photographer captures the impersonal nature of the partly-opened College Block.\nStudents using the facilities in the new Science Museum\nLibrary premises.\nMORALS AND ECONOMICS\nIn this Felix exclusive, Helen Lewis-Jones of the organisation 3W1( see front page)\ndiscusses the role of fund raising in relation to the problem of World poverty.\nFund raising improves\nthe quality of life for thousands of individuals, but it\nis now apparent that the\nraising of money alone is\nnot enough. The contribution that a private individual\nor agency can make towards\nthe Third World can at best\nbe a drop in the ocean.\nSo why approach \" impoverished students\", demanding part of their paltry\ngrant? Simply because certain facts must be faced by\nan intelligent section of the\npopulation, and they must\nbe faced now. In international relations the poor\nnations are treated as if they\nwere as economically developed as the rich; this means\nthey generally get a raw\ndeal. International agreements are dominated by the\ninterests of the \"White\n5 Year Plan\nIn response to a request\nfrom the Rector, ICU Council has set up a working\nparty to prepare evidence\nfor the IC quin que n niu m report to the UGC. The committee has met several times\nover the vacation and collected evidence from several\nUnion bodies, e.g. on sports\nfacilities. A major part of\nthe report will concern academic matters, particularly\nteaching methods, methods\nof assessment, course con-tent, and, most radically,\nhow to break down the rigid\ndepartment structures by\nthe proper use of course\nunits.\nEvidence would still be\nwelcomed from individual\nstudents, and should be in\nto the Union Office in the\nnext week.\nMan's Club\".\nTwo arguments can be\nused: moral and self-interest. The moral one is\nthat out of humanitarian\nreasons we could not let half\nthe world remain under-developed. The economic\nargument is that the rich\ncountries cannot afford to\nignore half the world in\nterms of untapped talent and\nresources. The problems of\noverpopulation and the gap\nbetween the rich and the\npoor are surely going to be\nthe most serious in the next\nfew decades. The belief that\nunderlies 3W1 is that the\ndiscrepancies between the\nrich nations and the poor\nwill be the all-time problem\nof the next twenty years.\nThere is no single panacea.\nEvery expert will tell you\nthat these problems must be\nsolved. The Government\nfaces them in theory, but is\nreticent about practical\naction where it seems to\nthreaten short-term strategic\ninterests. Governments mask\ntheir inactivity by altruistic\nrhetoric: Government aid is\noften little more than a political chess game.\n3W1, based on the BanPenney\nFaces ICU\nThe Rector, Lord Penney,\nhas acceded to a Union request to answer criticism of\nhis policy on discipline procedures and other issues at\nthe first Union General\nMeeting of the session on\nOctober 9th. Watch out for\nposters giving the time and\nplace.\nker's Order scheme, is essentially in existence to combat\nthis apathy and resistance by\ninforming intelligent public\nopinion. Every student who\nsigns a Banker's Order will\nbe sent a series of dossiers which will contain\narticles by a variety of experts concerned with the\nproblems of the developing\nnations. Ideas for future\naction will also be suggested.\nWe can all be armchair\nintellectuals. If you sign a Banker's Order, you will\nautomatically become a part\nof the \" Unlimited Company\" of 3W1, which has\nthe funds, the information\nand the organization to\nreally make an impact in\nthis country.

Welcome to Imperial\nCollege, part of the University of London. It is not, at\npresent, our concern to talk about the University of London,\nfor that great lumbering dinosaur needs an obituary rather\nthan an editorial, but to talk about I.C. as a University\ncollege. What, we may ask, distinguishes a University col-leg e? The long forgotten Robbins' report set forth four\naims of a University. These are worthy of attention if only\nbecause a member of that committee was I.C.'s late Rector,\nSir Patrick Linstead, and because at I.C., at least, the\nmoney has been more plentifully available than in many\nother institutions.\nRobbins' Aims\nRobbins said a University should educate, should train,\nshould advance knowledge and should transmit culture. We\nhave looked at these aims in relation to I.C. elsewhere, in\n' I.C. Socialist', the ' Anti-Handbook', but to do so again,\nhowever briefly, might be instructive.\nThis year should see the climax of a mounting campaign\nby I.C. students to prevent the complete obliteration of the\nfirst aim by the second. Linked as I.C. is to industry, the\ntemptation to put on narrow courses with the intention of\ntraining specialists has long proved irresistible to I.C's Board of Studies. This is what makes the Board's refusal to\nallow student observers on a regular basis so disappointing.\nAs Freshers will rapidly discover there is a real need to\nprovide an education which will broaden the mind; to, in\nthe classic phrase, \"prepare the whole man for the whole\nlife\". This is what is meant by the student campaign to\nbroaden courses, but as several of I.C.'s leading academics,\nincluding Lord Jackson, the Pro-Rector, realise I.C.'s special is m is failing even the Philistines of industry, whose need\nis for generalists rather than specialists. There is a need too\nto educate students to have a critical mind, so that they can\ncontinuously re-educate themselves in future years, and to\nparticipate in a conduit community\u2014but we will return to\nthis theme.\nUndergraduate fresher s will soon discover the role that\nresearch plays in this college. It is a predominant one, some\nwould say an almost exclusive one. Far from the aim that\nUniversities should push back the boundaries of knowledge\nas it is, only by living in a live research environment can\nthe teaching aspect of the college best flourish. However,\nfresher s will be slower to discover the culture which I.C. is transmitting. Of course, the college has an ethos, but this\nethos often falls far behind what can be termed cultural.\nLet us seek to build a community which has a real culture,\nwhere scientific integrity will flourish no matter what industry may say, and the many world cultures present at I.C. may be variously transmitted.\nCo-adult Community\nWe have, as promised, returned to the subject of com-m unity. Our Rector rightly stresses the need to build a community at I.C, one trusts he means a co-adult community\nin which there are no distinctions between staff, students,\nacademics or the ' authorities'; such a co-adult community\nis, as we have seen, vital to the fulfilment of the aims of a University. It is this need that makes the limitations placed\non participation high-lighted in todays news, on the B.o. C,H.o.S. and as regards the AA, most disquieting.\nThis too, is where the real worry lies about the Governors' insistence on ' double punishment', the principle that\nthe college has a right to supplement the legal processes of\nthe land in certain offences. Let the Rector when he addresses ICU on the 9th of October relinquish this insistence so\nwe can start to build this community. If not, people will\nseize upon this issue to expose staff-student relations as mere\npaternalism, and he may well wish he had abandoned\n' double punishment' for reasons of expediency as well as of\nprinciple.\nFELIX, THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nPhone 01-589-2963.

Everyone\nand everything is here to\nhelp you.\nI.C. and London can be\ngreat places to live in \u2014 so\nlive! Don't be too much of\na cabbage, though remember if you don't do enough\nwork you may get thrown\nout. Three years is a short\ntime really, so you need to\nget to know people, and one\nof the best ways to do this\nis to join one of I.C.'s teeming clubs. (Come to Freshers Afternoon in the Union).\nA lot will happen this\nyear; these events will be\ndevelopments of last years\nmany discussions and chan-ges. Back numbers of Felix\n(get them on Freshers Afternoon) should provide useful\nand informative reading.\nImportant matters to be\ndiscussed this year are:\u2014\nRepresentation on the 3\nmost important committees\nof the college (see Felix\nnews). The Rector's reply is\nnot good enough and the\nStudents Union must decide\nwhat to do next.\nI.C's Education: the student body has expressed an\noverwhelming desire to broaden degree courses but the\nchanges themselves have yet\nto be decided upon and\nagreed with the authorities.\nDouble Discipline: (Pun-ish ment under 2 codes of\ndiscipline for the same thing)\nWatch out for leaflets on\nthis important matter. It is\nexpected that The Rector\nwill turn up at the first\nUnion Meeting on October\n9th to explain his position.\nAnd many more items \u2014\nread next Felix and wall\nposters to get all the facts.\nSee you all, I hope, on October 9th. How lo make your\nmoney go further\nWhen the problem that you're faced with is the long ness of the time\ncompared with the shortness of the money, likely as not the answer\ncould be a visit to your local branch of Martins.\nAt Martins we have a way of applying all our experience of\nmanaging money to help you make the most of yours.\nCall in and have a word with the local Martins manager\u2014\nguaranteed un stuffy. We don't promise he'll make money for you,\nbut we're absolutely positive he'll see you get the best possible\nvalue out of whatever you've got.\nAsk him for the leaflet we've prepared specially\nfor students.\nMartins have a branch at\n35 Gloucester Road, London S.W.7.

Mooney\nMoans\nAs old lags Will now have\nrealised, the price of Mooney\nfood has increased yet again\n(3d. for main course, 2d. for\nsweets). This time most of\nthe increase is because more\nstaff are needed for the new\ncollege block refectories.\nThe final increases were\nsanctioned after the end of\nlast term when no members\nof the catering sub-commit-tee were available. Keith\nGuy, the only student to attend the meeting, Said the\nprice increases were inevitable under the dire um stances. However, many complaints\nare being made. In particular\nthe standard of food in the\nSouth-side lower refectory\nhas deteriorated tremendously in the last year and is now\n' almost inedible'.\nThere is faint glimmer of\nhope for the future. At the\nlast Union Council meeting\nit Was suggested that the\noperational research unit at\nIC be asked to make an efficiency study of IC's ref ect or ies. Prof. Eilon, head of the\nManagement Engineering section of Mech. Eng., in a letter to Pete Earl, Deputy\nPresident, suggested that an\nM.

Sir Robin Darwin,\nRector of the Royal College\nOf Art, who replaces him,\nrecently attacked the UGC\nand IC for the way in which\nthe site for the A A was ob-tai ned. A former IC President, Dr. A. Kitchener, has\nalso been appointed to the\nB.o.G.; FELIX files show\nhim to be a bald but efficient President although a rather better cricketer. N.C.

Despite his invitations to join\nhim, tempered with childish\ncomments such as \" It's quite\nwarm for the time of year'\n(the Sinister black pipe marked ' Sewers' was pointed out\nto him at a later date) were\nignored in favour of listening to predictions from the\nBracknell Oracle. Within the\nhour High Sea creamed out\nof Ramsgate harbour under\nfull sail, the scene was set for\nsome perfect sailing. This\nblissful existence was rudely\ninterrupted when we came\nout of the lee of the Kent\nCliffs. The sudden presence\nof a swell produced a similar\neffect to a17 in. armour\npiercing shell hitting a green-house. We now paid the price\nfor a hurried departure; the\nfirst knell of the calamity was\nthe Still half full bottle of\nduty free whisky performing\na death defying leap into the\nbilges. The skipper Who had\nbeen transferred directly\nfrom the arms of Bacchus to\nthose of Orpheus reacted like\na true salt.

Apparently\nthe response rate from this\ncollege was so good two years\nago and the information obtained so complete that it has\nbeen thought worthwhile to\nenlarge the scope of the study\nto find out What has happened to the drinking habits and\nattitudes of this group of\nstudents over a two year\nperiod. This will add enormously to the value of the\nstudy.\nSo all third year students\nshould look out for another\nquestionnaire which will appear shortly in their depart-ment s.

The first\nwas to concentrate all Administration in one building;\nthe second was to supply\nfrom the areas vacated by the\nvarious sections of administration new sites, rooms and\ngeneral accommodation for\nthe increasing needs of the\nacademic side of the college;\nthirdly because of increased\nnumbers the College felt the\nneed to provide more social\naccommodation and, with\nthis in mind, new refectories,\ncommon rooms, a large hall\nfor 800 people and two seminar areas (each taking 120),\nwere included in the build-ing.\nIn a separate part of the\nbuilding at the western end\nare also located not only the\nNational Science Library but\nthe Lyon Playfair, which is\nfor scientific matter, and the\nHaldane Library which is for\nbooks of general reading and\nalso includes a record library\nof high repute. The academic\nportion of the building is\nhoused on the upper floors at\nthe eastern end. On the top\nfloor are the offices of the\nRector, and Secretary, as well\nas the Maintenance and Development offices. On Level 4\nis found the Finance and Supplies section of administration\nand on Level 3 is the Registry. These sections may be\nreached by staircases located\nin the main hall in the middle of the building and also\nby staircases at the eastern\nend. There will also be a lift\nat the eastern end as well as\ntwo lifts in the main Hall.\nOn Level 2 at the eastern\nend is a cloakroom for the\nmain Student Common Room\narea, which is approximately\n9,000 square feet, off which\nis a Conference Room which\nwill be used by the Union.\nThis large Student Common\nRoom can be used for many\npurposes. It is completely\nnewly furnished by the College for the benefit of stud-ents, the carpets are plugged\nand can be removed if the\nroom is used for dancing or\nother activities where a carpet is not required. There will\nalso be a Bar at the end of\nthe Room and students can\ngo from the Common Room\ninto the Student Buttery,\nwhere it is hoped to be able\nto serve this type of meal,\nplus teas and coffees, for most\nof the day. The exact times\nwill be notified to students.\nBeyond this and further west\nis the Senior Common Room,\nthe Staff Dining Room and\nButtery, which are only open\nto members of staff.\nComing down to Level 1,\nor Ground Floor Level, will\nbe found the main College\nRefectory, which will serve\nboth cafeteria and waitress\nserved meals at lunchtime\nand will cater for large dinners in the evening. This Refectory has an ante-room,\nwhich is next door to the\nmain lift hall, and both this\nante-room and the refectory\nwill be open to all members\nof the College at lunchtime.\nBelow the ante-room on\nLevel 0 is a Quiet Room,\nwhich will hold about 130\npeople, and will be used for\nChurch Services of any religion and other similar pur-poses.\nAll that has been said so\nfar deals with College Block\nto the west of the main lift\nhall and main entrance. To\nthe east of this Hall there\nare, on Level 5, various\noffices, the two seminar\nrooms mentioned previously\n(one of which will be used for\nconcerts) and below these on\nLevel 4 will be various other\noffices and the lower entrances to the seminar rooms.\nOn Level 3 and 2 is located\nthe Great Hall, bookings for\nthis and the seminar rooms\nand the Quiet Room, will be\nthe duty of the Domestic\nBursar's Office. The Great\nHall is composed of a moving stage so that the number\nof people accommodated will\nbe dependent on the position\nof the stage. The numbers\naccommodated in the flat\narea of the Hall will be between 500 and 200. There is\nto the rear of this a bank of\nthick seats (holding about\n300) and there are, of course,\npress rooms, a projection\nroom and general operation\nrooms.\nFrom Level 2 entrance can\nbe gained to the two libraries\nwhich are located on the\nnorthern side of the main\npart of the building which\nleads to what used to be\ncalled Imperial Institute\nRoad. The only part of this\nInstitute which now remains\nis the Queen's Tower, which\nis surrounded by a lawn.\nOn the Ground Floor,\nunder the Great Hall and to\nthe west of the main entrance,\nare located the various sections of the Domestic Bursar's staff, including the Security Office, Student Houses\nand Halls of Residence Office\n(these latter two will move in\nOctober), the Books Office\nand Enquiry Desk for Bookings, and the General Messengers' Office.\nAlso on this level is the\nFirst Aid Room, where\npeople may go to rest if they\ndo not feel well. (They\nshould, however, inform the\nHealth Centre so that a nurse can come over if\nnecessary).\nOn the level below will be\nthe Telephone exchange\n(which will also be moving\ninto College Block later)\nand the Post Room.\nAt the present moment\nthere is a temporary office for\nthe National Westminster\nBank on Level 4 in the Main\nLift Hall, but this will be\nmoving as soon as possible\nto the most western end of\nthe building on Ground Floor\nLevel, and the Bank will have\na separate entrance on to the\nroadway which circles College Block.\nMention has not been\nmade of the fact that on\nGround Floor Level or Level\n1, the kitchens which will\nprovide the meals are located.\nConnected to these will be\nthe Office of the Refectory\nManager, Mr. Mooney, and\nhis various offices.\nNot in the building, but\nbuilt in conjunction with it is\nthe College Bookshop. This is\nlocated on the walkway\nwhich runs the whole length\nof College Block, on the\nsouth side, at Level 2, and is\nconnected with the Walkway\nwhich goes past Elec. Eng.,\nR.S. M., and Mech.

    "content": "HIST DAY SPECIAL6 D IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 280 29th SEPTEMBER, 1969\nHelen Aims High\nHits College\nA smile from Helen as the first Banker's Order is signed\nLast February five Oxford\nstudents formed an organisation known as 3W1 Third\nWorld First. Within 21 days\nthis organisation had encouraged 1000 students to sign\nbankers orders to contribute\none, two, or three per cent of\ntheir incomes towards the\nalleviation of world poverty.\nBy the summer the movement\nhad spread with equal success to 2 other universities.\nNow 3W1 is starting up at\nIC, where pretty Helen\nLewis-Jones aims to sign up\n10% of IC students.\nA vivacious blonde, Helen\ngraduated from Edinburgh\nlast session and is now employed by 3W1, who realised\nthat full-time workers would\nbe needed to maintain the\nmomentum gathered last ses-sion.\nIn an exclusive interview\nwith Felix\u2014see back page\u2014\nHelen told our reporter that\nthe average human being is\napproximately 18 years old,\nis illiterate, has a life expectancy of 34 years, and exists\non insufficient food. The increase is expenditure on\ntobacco and drink in the past\n2 years is, according to aV. C.O. A.D. pamphlet, greater\nthan the total amount of\ngrant aid sent each year to\nthe developing countries.\nHelen believes the solution\nto these enormous problems\ndoes not lie in the emotional\nresponse of collecting tins or\npictures of swollen-bellied\nchildren, but involves a rational decision of commitment and education. This is\nwhy 3W1 concentrates on the\nuse of Banker's Orders and\nwill circulate, to those who\nsign, an information dossier\non the subject.\nHelen told a small planning group of leading IC students that although backed\nby Oxfam, students could\nchoose the agency they preferred (e.g. Christian Aid,\nWar on Want, etc.) and the\nscheme and country to whom\nthey wished to give. After\nthe meeting, several Banker's Orders were signed.\nWearing the prettiest of\nmini-dresses and a red PVC\nmac, Helen promised to return today and will also speak\nat a meeting tomorrow (Tues-day) in the Union Top Refec\nat 1 p.m. Now turn to the back page\nfor an exclusive FELIX\ninterview with Helen LewisJones.\nBlow to Participation Hopes\nIn a midsummer letter to\nnew Union President Corbyn,\nLord Penney, the Rector of\nthe College, informed the\nUnion that it could have 3\nobservers on the Governing\nBody, but said little else to\nencourage hope of full Union\nrepresentation on important\nCollege bodies at an early\ndate. In particular, the observers on the Governing\nBody will be subject to strict\nconditions and the Board of\nStudies has completely rejected proposals for regular\nUnion observers at its meet-in gs. Corbyn is known to regard the letter as most dis-appointing.\nThe infamous JURGO (the\njoint committee of the Union\nand Governors) is to be reshaped so it may better fulfil its liaison function. The\nmembership will consist of 10\nmandated student representatives,3 Governors, the Rector, Pro-Rector, Deans of the\nConstituent Colleges, Secretary, 4 elected non-professorial staff, and one Warden.\nThe new JURGO meets on\n17th November.\nICU Council will be allowed its three observers on\nthe Governing Body for an\nexperimental period of 2\nyears, provided the meetings\nare treated as confidential.\nHowever, it is unlikely the\nUnion will agree to the Rector's suggestion that the observers must not be m and at able, or that they should be\nexcluded from meetings discussing staff appointments,\nselection of courses, or determination of academic stand-ard s. First Union reactions\nare that these are areas of\nvital interest to students, and\nthat the threatened exclusion s make a mockery of the kind\nof real participation the\nUnion is seeking.\nThe Governors have delayed a decision on the Union\nrequest for observers on the\nFinance and Executive Committee of the BoG, regarded\nas one of the major centres\nof power, until Lord Sherfield, their chairman, returns\nfrom hospital.\nHowever, the major blow\nto student hopes comes in the\ndecision of the Board of Studies not to invite students observers except on specific\noccasions. This is almost\ncertain to prove unsatisfactory to the Union as the\nmajor anxiety of those advocating participation was to\nbroaden courses, reform\nmethods of assessment, and\ngenerally to discuss important academic matters.\nThe subject matter of the\nRector's letter is certain to\nbe raised at the first IC Council meeting, and probably at\nthe first Union Meeting.\nEngagement\nThreatened\nThe long and protracted\nnegotiations which could\nbring the Architectural Association into IC as the fourth\nconstituent college, have been\nmoving comparatively swiftly\nduring the vacation.\nSince the allocation of the\nsite in Jay Mews, near the\nRCA, for the use of the A A by the University Grants\nCommittee (acting as the\n\"marriage-broker\") the A A has been trying to find half a million pounds to finance the\nmove from its present cramped site. During the vacation\nthe UGC offered to match the\nA A pound for pound in their\nfund-raising now that the A A have collected over \u00a3180,000.\nHowever, the A A is showing\nconsiderable reluctance to\njoin on IC's terms, and at\npresent IC's Secretary Micky\nDavies and Rector Lord\nPenney do not seem keen to\ncompromise.\nContacts between A A and\nIC students have brought\nsympathy for the A A point\nof view. At present the Association is highly independent\n\u2014it is led by meetings of the\nschool community, consisting\nof lecturers, students, and all\ntypes of staff. There are no\nwritten exams, most work is\nproject work, and there are\nno permanent academic staff,\nand only the principal stays\nfor more than 2 years. The\npresent lecturers are architects from businesses who\ncome in and out, thus preventing ideas from fossil is in g,[f the A A joins IC all this will,\naccording to our Rector, have\nto go. The school will be\ngoverned by our BoG, their\nstaff will have to include at\nleast 10 permanent members,\nrecognised as teachers by the\nUniversity of London, and\nthe inflexible course unit and\nexam systems will be imp os ed. Above all it is difficult to\nsee how the real sense of the\nacademic community, both in\nterms of study and control,\ncould be preserved.\nLord Penney is reported to\nhave told A A Principal John\nLloyd in public that the University was responsible for\nthe strict terms of the mer-ger. The UGC's offer of\nmoney is, in fact, conditional\nupon the merger taking place.\nGiven all this, the A A students say it is not worthwhile joining, in contrast to\nthe IC students, who would\nwelcome their creative influence. However, informed\nopinion now suggests that\nthat Lord Penney and the\nGovernors will not be too\ndisappointed if the move\nbreaks down altogether.\nCollege Block\nAbove is a view of the new\nCollege Block, parts of which\nare now coming into use.\nSee back page for further\npicture and news, and page\n6 for a guided tour of the\nnew building by Carl Seaford, the Domestic Bursar.\n\n"

That's something no-one expected until Martin Bland broke the\nnews to a startled college that he would be proposing Piers at the forthcoming election.\nFrom then it was only a matter of time before he won 40% more votes than Spike Bantin\nand was declared President of the Union. Although only in his fifth year at college he is\npossibly the best-known person there, if only on account of the colossal amount of duplicated info, sheets he turns out. To explain how he lost his senses and was conned into proposing Piers, we persuaded the aforementioned Martin Bland to write a short profile of\nthe man himself.\nCorbyn \u2014 Genius or Madness ?\nIt has been said that\ngenius and madness are separated by a thin line. Piers\nRichard Corbyn, or \"Crow-face\" to his friends, has one\nfoot somewhat shakily\nplanted on each side of it.\nHe may often be seen striding from Soutshside to the\nUnion, or Physics, clutching\ngreat sheaf s of paper, which\nhe tends to leave in trail's behind him, like fallout from\nthe information explosion,\nand muttering to himself a strange monosyllable best\nrendered in print as \"buzz z buzz z\". This phenomenon has so\namazed the students of I.C. that When the first ever college wide election for the\npost of president was held\nlast June, they decided to\ngive Piers the job.\nWho is Piers Corbyn? He\ncomes from human parents\n(though looking at him you\nmay suspect some traces of\nchimpanzee) somewhere in\nthe region of Newport,\nShropshire, where he is\nknown to his family as\nRichard and to his friends\nas \"Mad Dick\". He first entered these hallowed halls in\n1965 as a physics undergraduate with an insane desire\nto work. He soon began to\ndivert part of his energy to\nother aspects of student life,\nand threw himself into the\nclub scene, spending his\nthird year as president of\nMaths, and Phys. soc. He\nwas associated with various\nother club activities and even\ndisplayed his athletic prowess\nby croSS-country running,\nand it was no doubt then\nthat he acquired the somewhat extravagant habit of\nrunning to Marble Arch and\nback at 2 a.m., to the bewilderment of the fuzz and the\nhorror of passing taxis.\nLast year, as a first-year\nPhysics P.G., Piers really\ncame into his own as the I.C. catalyst, except that in his\ncase he increased the rate\nof action rather than re-action. I had the misfortune\nto live on the same landing\nas Piers last year and many\nwas the night I was kept\nawake by the clattering of a typewriter (my typewriter, he\nseemed to borrow it permanently!) as the latest bump h sheet was born. Piers had an\nobsession with spreading in-formation, Which, I suppose,\nis highly commendable in a floor rep., as he was at the\ntime, but hard on my type-writer.\nFrom the whirlwind of\nCorbyn energy was born the\nU.S.K. of Which you will\nread much elsewhere, and\nthe new constitution would\nnot have come about without\nhim. Not that he accomplished these things alone, of\ncourse. The Corbyn enthusiasm is infectious (beware!)\nand he is a past master of\nconning people into doing\nthings for him. Even I,I must admit, was conned into\nproposing him for president\nand managing his campaign.\nHe conned the Union Top\nBrass into giving him a Union General Award, the\nhighest honour the Union\ncan give one of its members,\netc., etc., in recognition of\nhis efforts. He even conned\nthe Union members into\nvoting for him. So there he\nis, President, and I am back\nwhere I began.\nSo I hope you're happy\nwith your President. Next\ntime you see him in the bar,\ntry and get him to buy you\na drink (something I always\nfind very difficult) and tell\nhim what you think of him,\nthe Union, I.C. in general\nand anything el ese you think\nis worth the effort. He's your\npresident, make sure he\nknows how you want your\nUnion run and make sure he\nruns it that way. I'm off to\nI.C.I, so you'll have to see\nthat he behaves yourselves.\nHave a good year!\nMARTIN BLAND\nEarl Arrives\nPresenting Mr. Pete Earl,\nabout whom little was known\nuntil the middle of last term.\nThen posters began to appear\nin the departmental buildings\nand halls of residence, bearing a line sketch and the\nlegend \"Pete Earl, VicePresident\". This duly came\ntrue at the very end of last\nyear.\nIn an election poll of over\na thousand votes, Pete Earl\ndefeated George Assimakis\nby only 30 vote's, no mean\nfeat considering how well-know his opponent is.\nIn contrast to George, he\nproduced very little electoral\npropaganda and information,\nhis campaign rested solely on\nhis hustings speech, although\nhe did have the considerable\nbacking of the R.S. M. and\nthe Rugby Club.\nHe is a Minesman, a member of the Anglican Chaplaincy, and, by common consent and opinion, a nice guy,\nwhich is a useful qualification for one of the most\nthankless jobs in the Union,\nthe Deputy Presidency. He\nhas been defeated in a bid to\nbecome a Floor Rep., and\nwas the assistant secretary of\nthe Athletics Club Committee, organising coach transport for teams and other\nsuch business. He helped to\norganise the Rugby Club\nduring his time with A.C.C.; this year he will be vice-chairman of the Chaps club,\nthe Mines' drinking club,\nand as such he will be in\ncharge of discipline.\nIn the academic year 67-68 his was the task of organising the Carnival Fete. It\nrained on the day and a loss\nwas made, but it was said at\nthe time that Pete was relatively inexperienced and received little or no help from\nthe Carnival Committee.\nSince then he has had time\nto gain experience in org a Pete Earl\nni sing committee affairs, and\nis now about to embark on a year of helping to organise\nthe Union's affairs, on which,\nwe hope, he will spend\nslightly more time than he\ndoes with the Mines drinkers.\nNot having any propaganda\nto keep to, he has a free\nhand in his policies; whether\nthese prove right or not we\nwill not know until the end\nof the year.\nGuy \u2014 At Last\nKeith Guy was voted Secretary of the Union by a substantial majority over S. Sivasegarem, although one\ntenth of the poll abstained.\nIronically, last year he was\nan opponent of some of the\nconstitutional reforms, mainly on the grounds that\nthe proposed council would\nbe far too unwieldy to be\neffective, since its size would\nbe swollen with several departmental reps. This was an\nobjection held by many, and\nwas the greatest stumbling\nblock in having the reforms\npassed, as they finally were,\nbut the reforms did mean\nthat Keith was elected by all\nthe members Of the Union.\nHe is in a unique position\nto express his views on Council, for this will be his fifth\nyear as a member, having\nheld several different post of\nresponsibility since the beginning of his third year.\nHe's been at I.C. for seven\nyears, and has a Masters degree in Chemical Physics.\nHaving blown himself up\nduring his studies for\na Ph.D., he started again\nafter two year and is at present studying in Chemical\nEngineering.\nTo go briefly through his\ncareer, he claims to have\ndone nothing in his first year,\nthen became secretary of\nConSoc. (Conser vat ive Society) in bis second. He\ntook over as chairman of\nConSoc. in his third year\nhere, and then chairman of\nthe Social Clubs Committee\nWhen he Started his first year\nas aP.G. He became, in\nquick succession, a floor rep.\non council, secretary of the\nEntertainments Committee,\nand then Chairman of the\nEnts. Committee.\nAppropriately, he describes the Union as his main\nhobby, and en j by s watching\nthe same people squabbling\nover the Council Table every\nyear. He is married to a schoolteacher, has no children yet. Politically, he says\nhe is a \"left-wing conservative, if anything\", but plenty\nof people could be found to\ndisagree with the \"'left-wing\"\npart! Nevertheless, he claims\nthere are as many hard-line\nright wingers he disagrees\nWith as there are on the extreme left, and the only\npeople he is intolerant of are\nthose Who will not tolerate\nothers.\nSo that is Keith Guy, one\nof the most experienced\npeople in the Union, and\nholding a job which means a great deal of hard work.\nGood luck to him!\n\n"

Since then there has been Benjamin, The Graduate, in another Nicholls-directed film. He\nmanaged to break two marriages in the space of one film,\neven going to the lengths of kidnapping the bride with the\nwedding ring hardly on her finger. Most recently, Laughter\nin the Dark, from a book by Nabokov, has a cinema usherette stealing a millionaire art-dealer away from his wife and\ndaughter. The road to the divorce courts means thriving\nbox-office.\nCurrently, the most controversial \"other woman\" is a nineteen-year-Old girl played by Judy Geeson, in Three into\nTwo Won't Go, one of the few notable films released during\nthe vacation. Iris Murdoch wrote the screenplay, and Rod\nSteiger and Claire Bloom do most of the acting. Like George\nand Martha, the couple they play, the Howards, are unable\nto have oh il d ren. Unlike George and Martha they are also\nunable to come to terms with their disability and are slowly\nbut surely drifting apart from each other. The husband is\na business man, used to travelling as a sales representative to\nthe Manchester branch of his firm and, on the return jour-ney, spending the night at a hotel managed by an old friend\nof his. His wife is busy decorating their new home in the\nsuburbs, where most of the later action takes place. Miss\nGeeson is the young hitch-hiker picked up on the return\njourney by Mr. Howard, and spending the night with him at\nthe hotel. The following morning she decides to stay there\nand work as a maid and waitress. Steiger shrugs his shoulders, gives her a fiver and drives homewards to his long\nsuffering wife.\nHe soon travels north again. Not unnaturally he visits the\nhotel on both north and southbound journeys, only to discover on his return stay that the girl has handed in her\nnotice and left no hint of where she is going. He soon finds\nout. however, for a few days later she arrives at his house\nand introduces herself to Mrs. Howard, who invites her to\nspend the night. From there the plot unfolds with the predictable result.\nCONTRIVED\nIt is the character of the girl which seems most contrived.\nShe keeps a notebook in which she takes notes on all the\nmen she has slept with, giving each a mark or grade, like a schoolteacher marking a child's exercise book. She is able\nto present any personality she likes according to the demands\nof the situation; at one time warning Mr. Howard that if he\ndoesn't do as she says, she will swear at the top of her voice\nin the hotel breakfast room, at another, tearfully explaining\nto his wife that she thinks she is going to have a baby. She\npays the molested schoolgirl so well she is allowed to stay on\nat the Howards' until she can have a medical check. A great\ndeal of the story rests on the baby the girl says she is expecting and the childless marriage of the Howards. Steiger is\npersuaded that the child is his, and he, presented with the\nproof that it is not he who is infertile, agrees to do anything\nfor the girl if she will not have an abortion.\nThe best of the film lies in the Bloom - Steiger dialogue.\nHaving moved into a house Where neither of them really\nbelieves they can live happily without children, they constantly bicker over whether they should adopt a child or not.\nShe feels certain about his infidelity but still clings to the\nhope that a baby could repair their marriage. She regularly\nvisits her mother in an old peoples' home and has to listen\ncontinually to the story of how her father brought another\nwoman to live with him, but she, Mrs. Howard's mother,\nwas too proud to leave him. Steiger refuses to let his mother-in-law live in his house, and is taking to drink in the face\nof his marital problems.\nIn among all the tension and adultery, there are some\nsurprisingly funny episodes, but overall it is a form of\ndomestic tragedy with the young and free seemingly wielding\ndestructive power over an older generation weighed down\nwith conventions and responsibility. Perhaps with less accomplished actors and actresses, some of the situations portrayed\nwould seem farcical and the characters absurd; the film\nhas none of the powerful darkness of atmosphere that lasted\nthroughout the night of fun and games in Virginia Woolf.\nThere the action was compact, sometimes acidly funny, at\nothers just quietly sinister, but even during the most unbelievable episodes it was compelling because the characters\nwere so well drawn in Albee's original play. It was the older\nexperienced couple, who seemed to detest each other, who\nhad learnt to live together, and the younger college doctor\nand his wife Who were forced to see their marriage as a sham.\nThree into Two Won't Go is worth seeing for the acting,\nbut the well-written screenplay and dialogue disguises a plot\nthat is both contrived and predictable. You could say that\nthe girl seems so inhuman because She is merely a symbol of\na youthful avenging angel sent to punish a couple unable to\nlive with each other's inadequacies and their own fears, but\neven as such she seems a parody of a human being. To me\nnone of the subsequent action fulfils ,the promise of the\nfilm's beginning, but i lt is a notable addition to the eternal-triangle film-theme market.\nBLOW-UP AT IC\nI.C. Film Soc. Programme\nthis year is well balanced and\nincludes Tom Jones, Blow-Up,\nThe Taming of the Shrew,\nfilms from the Czechoslovak\nRenaissance (1964/8) and lesser known American films such\nas The Trip and The Queen.\nShowings are every other\nFriday at 7.30 in the Concert\nHall. For further details visit\nthe Society's stall at the Freshers' Day Union Fair.\nRECORD REVIEWS\nUnhalfbricking\nFairport Convention (Island\nILPS 9102).\nThe Convention's third LP,\nthis contains three very long\ntracks including Sandy\nDenny's \"Who Knows Where\nthe Time Goes?\" and\nDylan's \"Percy's Song.\"\nTheir current single release,\nalso a Dylan song, is probably the worst track and\nseems to have been selected\nas the only track short\nenough to be released separately. Nevertheless, the standard overall is very good,\nand the group have proved\nextremely capable at arranging traditional songs for\nproduction on record. There\nis only one example on this\nLP, but it takes up half the\nplaying time of the first side.\nFairport Convention seem\nto inhabit the border between folk and pop; their\nmusic is a modern arrangement of basically simple old\nmelodies. Lead singer Sandy\nDenny is one of the best girl\nsingers in Britain, often\nsounding like America's Judy\nCollins.\nWith a little\nhelp from my\nfriends\nJoe Cocker (Regal Zonophone).\nJoe Cocker sings many standard soul songs as well as his\nfirst two singles \"Marjorine\"\nand \"With a Little Help\nfrom my Friends.\" Among\nthe older tracks are the Animals' hit of a few years ago\n\"Don't let me be Misunderstood\" and the best track, in\nmy opinion, \"I Shall be Released\". Together with several less well known songs,\nthese comprise a very enjoyable record, which confirms\nJoe Cocker's position as\nBritain's major white soul-singer.\nThe Pious Bird\nof Good Omen\nFleetwood Mac (Blue Horizon).\nThis LP takes tracks from\nFleetwood Mac's first two\nalbums, added to which are\ntheir first instrumental single,\nAlbatross, and their latest,\n\"Need your Love so Bad.\"\nSeveral are composed by\nPeter Green and Jeremy\nSpencer, and most tracks are\nworth listening to, but 1\ncannot see the point in producing a record containing\nmaterial already on records\nwhich Fleetwood Mac fans\nwill have bought before.\nIt is interesting to know\nthat only Spencer and Danny\nKirwen were not in John\nMayall's Bluesbreakers before joining Fleetwood Mac.\nAs a collectors' album\nLooking Back, by John Mayall, is unique. It contains\ntracks recorded by all the\nmembers of his group over\nthe past years, including\nMick Taylor, Ainsley Dunbar, Eric Clapton, Jack\nBruce, Mick Fleetwood,\nJohn McVie, Peter Green\nand, of course, John Mayall.\nBring your grant cheque to the Midland Use it to start a bank account with\nthe Midland.

Box31 Derby The Anti - Hero\nTo students about to\nplough into another year's study of scientific texts and\nnotes, and to fresher s faced\nwith a ghastly array of textbooks they will be urged to\nbuy and will never read, it\nmay seem sheer stupidity to\nsuggest that there is any\nother kind of literature with\nwhich they can pass their leisure time. But unscientific\nreading does not automatically mean uninteresting read-ing, and some contrast in\nwhat you read is essential if\nyou are to avoid becoming a dreaded \"damned scientist\"\nwith a mind like an automatic clock. So read on.\nThe paperback edition of\nA Small Town in Germany\nhas just been printed by Pan\nBooks at 6/-. The author is\nJohn Le Carre, best known\nfor \"The Spy Who Came In\nFrom The Cold\". All of his\nfive novels contain main\ncharacters whom he tries to\nmake as unlike able and detestable as possible, the antihero taken to extremes, and\nalthough his books are on\nespionage they are as different from the conventional\nFleming or Deighton spy-thriller as Graham Greene is\ndifferent from Enid Blyton.\nThe small town in Germany is Bonn, the western\ncapital but overshadowed by\nthe much larger cities of\nHamburg, Frankfurt, Munich. The anti-hero is a British\ncivil servant, Turner, sent to\nthe British Embassy to investigate the disappearance of\na minor official who took\nwith him several major files.\nTurner seems to hate every-one; his main qualification\nfor his job is his ability to\nbreak down the people he\nhas to interrogate.\nAt the Bonn Embassy he\nmeets the father of a girl he\nhad interrogated at a previous occasion, and who had\nconsequently had a nervous\nbreakdown. He soon makes\nhimself unpopular with almost all the other officials\nand staff, except for de Lisle,\na diplomat who can see that\nTurner's main war is with\nhimself. His main aim is to\nfind out as much as possible\nabout the character of the\nman who disappeared, hoping\nhe will be able to see where\nhe would logically hide with\nthe files, but he finds this surprisingly difficult, the man\nseemed to be friends with\nno-one, a shadow working in\nthe embassy for twenty years.\nSlowly he develops some\nform of affinity with the de-fe ctor, both men at war with\neveryone else and with each\nother.\nThe noticeable thing about\nTurner, Leamas and Smiley,\nLe Carre's anti-heroes, is that\nno matter how contemptible\nand unlike able they are por-t rayed, as you read on you\ninevitably start to understand\nthem and come to sym pathis e with their quandary. This is\none of a very few books\nwhich can honestly be described as thrillers.\nFor science-fiction addicts,\nJim Ballard's Disaster Area\nhas been produced in paperback from Panther, 5/-. It\ncontains nine stories not reprinted from previous collections and of a very high stan-dard. The disaster in the title\nsometimes refers to a worldwide disaster, as in Storm\nBird, Storm Dreamer, where\nmutation has caused some\nseabirds to grow to gigantic\nsizes. At night they come to\nhaunt the private world of a man living alone on an abandoned jetty. More often, the\ndisaster is a private disaster,\nthe disaster of two men deprived of sleep and dreams by\na scientific experiment, or the\ndisaster of a man stranded in\na city which stretches indefinitely in all directions. Ballard's characters live in a dream world constantly turning to nightmare.\nFinally, if all you want is\na fast-moving blood-and-thunder story, Panther have\nalso recently published a glut\nof Chester Himes novels, all\nconcerning two negro cops,\nCoffin Ed and the Grave Digger. The setting is Harlem at\nnight, the plots concern dope\nsmuggling, gold robbery,\nmurder and almost any crime\nyou care to mention. All very\nslick and amusing, these are\nthe kind of books you can\nread in an hour or two and\nthen throw away, or take\nback to the second-hand\nbook shop.\nBookshop expands to College Block\nThe bookshop has now moved from its cramped quarters\nin the Beit quadrangle to new spacious premises between\nChem. Eng. and College Block and with the move has come\na complete change around of the system designed to make\nit both more attractive and efficient.\nBooks are now on display and can be perused before\npurchase, the range of books being gradually built up,\nparticularly in paperbacks and fiction. A changeover to the\ncontinental A4 system of paper sizes is being implemented.\nThere is a large browsing area where the books are kept,\nan exit from which is via a cash desk and a' quick sales'\ncounter for ties, pens, etc. The duplicating service, details\nof which can be had on request, will be continued and the\nshop has a staff of four under Miss Basden, the manager ess. All profits go into the Union, so that it is in the interests\nof all students to shop there.\nHours of opening are 9.30 to 5.30 on weekdays in term\ntime, closed from 11.50 to 12.30 during the first two weeks\nof this term but open all day thereafter. During the vac.\nthe hours will be 9.30 to 2.30. Unfortunately, book tokens\ncannot be bought or accepted. It can be reached along the\nwalkway on the North side of College block from level 2 of\nElec. Eng., Civ. Eng. or Chem. Eng. or up the steps from\nthe link road behind Chem. Eng. A large illuminated sign\nmarks it clearly.\nFresher s do not be put off by imitations There is only one IMPERIAL COLLEGE BOOKSHOP\" Inside\nInformation \"\nThe Dickens Press has this\nsummer published a most\nuseful series of paperbacks\ncalled \" Inside Information \"\n(5/- each). An attempt to present the guidance of experts\nfor today's man in the street\nthe books deal with several\nof the most important social\nproblems.
