M.C. who spent their summer holiday in Scotland all arrived, by a miracle of chance, at Glencoe Youth Hostel at approximately the same time. Thereafter, we spent three days\nin the S.M.C. hut on Ben Nevis and about eight days\nin Skye. The stay at the hut was most successful and three great ridges of Ben Nevis were climbed. To emerge from the wild and lonely grandeur of these ridges onto a summit decorated with. tourists and orange peel was like entering another, less pleasing, world. If they had come up for the view they were disappointed for the Ben is most unkind to the tourist in this respect. We arrived at Glen brittle on a glorious day.\nFrom the 'bus the main Cu ill in ridge seemed ' bec kon us was the weather going to improve at. last?\nIt was not to be, for poor weather, thick mist and two days spent on rescue parties put us ill at ease with the Cu ill on. Had the virtues of these\nhills been exaggerated? Then came a day of glorious sunshine with lunch on the Cio ch and tea on S gur r Alasdair, the latter accompanied by the most wonderful view Britain can offer on one side the jagged peaks of the ridge, on the other, the islands resting peacefully on a blue sea. Me ran down the stone shoot into Coi re Lagen, happy in the k nov/ ledge of a day well spent. She Cu ill in had Nvoven their spell and v;e had fallen under it. INSECTS G* oMa>ez>\nbut the entire absence of some animals which the zoologists had come prepared to study, and the grounding of most insects rather spoiled this line of work. The surveyors set forth man-fully on most days laden with an impressive array of instruments, but on several occasions were forced to return when the rain on their theodo lite telescopes cut visibility down to little more than a few inches.\" \"OUR oe s cR VER.

    "content": "FELIX\nTHE SUMMER REGATTAS1951 will surely go down in history as\n\"Cambridge's Year\". Having won the Boat Raoe\nand beaten Yale and Harvard in America, the\nCambridge college crews proceeded to win six of\nthe nine events at Henley and ended the season\nwith their Goldie crew winning the Eights for Great Britain in the European Championships. As\na result of this high standard, competition in the\nSummer Regattas was keen and the races fought out\nstroke for stroke.\nHaving won the Thames Cup at Walton, the I. C.1st VIII went to Reading with high hopes, and with\na little more stride in the second minute, might\nwell have won. However, after a very exciting\nrace, St. Catherine's( Camb.), the finalists, beat\nthem by a canvas. So to Marlow. Here the Eight\nwere drawn against Clare, second on the river at\nCambridge and stroked by the redoubtable David\nJennens who led Cambridge to so many great victories this year. The crew rowed extremely well,\nled Clare off the start and hung grimly on to a lead of one-third length for more than half the\ndistance. From here to the finish the greater\nsolidity of Clare at the finish of the stroke began to tell and they slowly pulled up to win a very good race by half a length. Clare went\nthrough to the final. Marlow really begins the Henley fortnight - a Royal Regatta, wh i oh this year will be remembered\nby all who saw it for some magnificent rowing and\nracing on all four days of a very hard-fought and\nexciting character. Drawn against Peterhouse\n(Camb.), I.C. paddled up to the start in fine\nfettle, though not as far advanced as their coach\nhad hoped owing to one or two mishaps during\ntraining. Still the crew looked good and felt it and rowed a race which neither they nor Peterhouse\nare likely to forget in a hurry.\nBoth crews s tru ok37^ in the first minute and\nI.C. were ahead at the first signal. At the\nBarrier both were striking35 and Peterhouse were\nslightly in the lead. At Fawley Peterhouse were\nleading by nearly half a length in a time of 3\nmin. \u00a38 sees, and both crews were still striking\n35. At Remenham Club, I.C. began to take it home\nand raised their rating. Peterhouse replied and\nat the mile signal both crews were striking38 with Peterhouse just in the lead. This rating\nwas held the whole of the way along the enclosures,\nboth crews fighting it out stroke for stroke and\nvirtually level until the last few strokes when\nPeterhouse pulled ahead to win by a canvas. A very fine race. The time, one of the fastest\nof the day, was 7 min. 8 sees.\nOwing to vac. work, the crew had no further\ntraining before Kingston Regatta and this told its tale in the way the crew scrambled home in their first heat. However, they improved with ea oh heat and just lost the final to Argosy B.C. by a quarter length.\nCREW: G.W. BENSON (bow); R.G. SEAMAN;\nJ. CM. TAYLOR; H. METCALFE;\nP.G. ESSAM; A.G.P.

Having\nvisited many places of interest, we had u Batch in the evening with the University. Although we had\nfirst and second places in nearly all the track\nevents, the match was lost, according to their\ncalculations!\nA weak was spent at Ballerup, just outside\nCopenhagen. Five days were had in sightseeing,\ninvolving late nights and erratic meals! This inevitably lowered our standard of athletics, but were\nable to sake a good show at Horsholn, collecting an\nassortment of pots.\nA quick visit was made to Blsinore, where we\nwere the guests of the town. Having seen Hamlet's castle, had a banquet(and a much needed siesta!) we\ncompeted against teams from Norway, Sweden, Finland\nand Denmark. I.C. reached the finals in some events,\nbut the standard was very much international.\nOur final match was at Aarhus, I.C. again\nsuperior in track events, but the Danes better in field events, the mato h being lost5761. Many things will be re men be red of the tour.\nPerhaps the occasion when we discovered, too late,\nthat excess fares are'nt paid at the barrier Sasray\nbailed us out t Or the very tipsy Dane who fell out\nof a carriage door, backwards, with an unsuspecting\npassenger!

The\nboaters worn by the team- they had their uses!\nOur thanks go to Norman Bamways for arranging\nthe tour so well, and to the Danish for such overwhelming hospitality. WICKETS IN THE WEST The team which went on the club's Devon Tour\nat the and of June was weakened by the absence of\nseveral of the bast players. As a result the matches\n\u2022era marked more by in aiv i dual achievement than\ncollective success. Brightest in the spectrum of\nbrilliance was Holy Reynolds who reached a score of\n24, for the first time in his life, after taking 5\nwickets for 29 in tha game against Tavistock. Rambau'E end Wyles each made a useful score in innings which\nwould otherwise have bean total losses, wot less\noutstanding in a different sense, was that batsman\nwho contrived to be bowled first ball twice in the\nsame day.\nBy the sea at Paignton, or in'.the timbered\nbuildings of old-world Uxater, the players were able\nto relax from th air daily cares.

    "content": "FELIX 5\nCOMMEMORATION BAY In October l845 \u00bbGeorge Street,Hanover Square saw\nthe opening of the College of Chemistry, later, by consent\nof Queen Victoria, called Royal. This was the first fore runner of the Imperial College. The Centenary of this event was celebrated in October 1945 when the Visitor to the College, His Majesty the King,accompanied by Her Majesty the Queen,graciously attended formal celebrations in the Albert Hall, at which some 5.000 guests were present. For the next two days\" the College was open to some 6.000\nguests who visited the Departments.\nThe Royal visit was commemorated by Commemoration\nDay Lectures, delivered in the next three e years. In1949. however,it was decided to try a different sort of function. The new ceremony was designed to give the Colleges, the, Students,and the newly elected Dlplomates and Associates, severally, a special part in the Function. The three Colle ges in turn invite the rest of the College and College Guests to a Conversazione. The College of the year leads\nthe Procession, in which all the students of Imperial College march to the Great Hall of the University, followed by a cohort of Teaching Staff in scarlet and Gold and the\nChairman of the Governing Body,the Rector, the Distinguished) Visitor and other personages.\nWithin the Great Hall the newly elected Diplomates\nand Associates are presented to the Chairman of the Cover\nning Body and the Chairman of the Delegacy. This pre a ent ation has been revised so as to make the ceremony more\npersonal and impressive for the individual student. It represents a public recognition of his academic career at Imperial College. Scrolls are presented to newly elected Honorary Fellows and in1949 an Imperial College Choir gave the first performance of Sir George Dyson's\" An\ninvocation to Science\", a setting of an extract from\nWordsworth's Excursion composed especially for the Imperial College. A short address is then given by the Distinguished Visitor. In1949 this role was filled by Mr.Herbert Mor rl son,the Lord President of the Council./ Six Governors of the Imperial College are appointed by the Privy Council/. Last year Sir Bruce White,himself an old student of the\nCity and Guilds College, kindly filled at short notice the\ngap left by the death of Field Marshal Lord Wavell, who\nhad accepted the invitation. This year marks the Centenary of the Royal School of Mines,which started life in1851 as the \"Government School\nof Mines and Science applied to the Arts\". Sir Andrew\nMcCance.an eminent old student of the R.3.K., has accepted\nthe invitation to be the Distinguished Visitor, and the\nOld Students of R.S. M.are holding a special evening\nConversazione at the R.S. M. on a more ambitious scale than usual. The Union hold a Commemoration Ball in the evening.\nThis year Commemoration Day will be celebrated on 25th October and the Ball will be held on 26th October to relieve the crowded programme.\n(With acknowledgements to 'The Record')\nMORPHY DAY\nThe Morphy and Lowry Cups are fought for by eights of the three colleges, from Hammersmith\nto Putney. Excitement always runs high and great battles are wa& ed not only by the crews but also by the other members of the colleges massed along the banks near the I.e. boat house. SATURDAY HOPS\nThis year one oat ur day evening in each\nmonth will be kept free of all organised ent-ert a in ment, the lounge and bar still being open\nto students who like to use them more quietly, i he first such night is Sat. 13th Oct. Clubs and\nSocieties are welcome to organise their own dances\non the remaining Saturuays, but the I.C. Entertainments Committee promise to hold informal dances on\nthose evenings not otherwise filled. Admission to the \"hops\" for Union members with or without partners will only be on production of Union Card while unaccompanied la die^ may only gain admission on production of special tickets which\nwill be sent to selected Colleges. An admission\nfee may be charged at the discretion of the committee. It is hoped to hold a rather special \"Guy\nFawkes Hop\" on November 3.\nSUNDAY FILM SHOWS\nThroughout the first two terms the I.C. Film Society presents films of a persistently high quality, on alternate Sunday evenings in the New\nlounge. This years programme includes such films as \"A Day at the Races,\" Swamp Water\" \" Bicycle Thieves\" and \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\" Deta il s of membership of the Society and tickets for the shows may be obtained from the Secretary.

TRAVELS\nGETTl NG AWAY FROM IT ALL\nFROM OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT\nThis year's long vacation has been characterized by the range of the travels under-taken. It is as if I.e. men had vied with\neach other for the distinction of travelling the farthest. Their wanderings cover four\ncontinents. Prizes for the furthest destination go to three parties who went to America,\nAsia and Africa respectively. David Griffiths and Bryan Pile were among several Miners who\ncor s sed the Atlantic to visit gold mines in Canada, where, they admit, they \"staked no\nclaims but claimed a few steaks\". Sam Mossman\nand George sturt flew to Bahrein Island in the\nPersian Gulf, there to interest themselves in oil free from politics. Wally Goss took a University soccer eleven on a tour of Kenya\nand describes his experiences in the next column.\nAs usual the Mines sent a contingent to the\nGold Coast, over 2000 miles away. Other\nvisitors to Africa were Brian pur slow and\nCM. Hargreaves who took a boat to Tangier\nand returned overland through Spain.\nThere were the usual hordes of penniless\nI.C. men scouring Europe for the lowest dives\nand cheapest hotels. Spain and Austria again\nseem to have been popular in direct proportion\nto the favour ability of their exchange rates.\nPour members of I. C.W. A. were seen in an\ninnsbruck beer garden swigging lager from\nlarge tankards in the company of leather-trouser ed Tyroleans, (from a usually reliable\nsource). Near Seville, Stephen wear ne nearly\nbuilt a dam on the Guadalquiver, was shaved\nby a barber and escaped a visit from your reporter only because he was making up to a girl in the local cigarette factory at the time.\n(Continued on p'. ge 3.)\nHAIRCUTTING SERVICE\nThe services of a Hairdresser, Mr. Mablin,\n. will be available to members of the Union, in a' room on the second floor of the Refectory\nBuilding. Appointments will be by bookings to\nMr. Mablin only.\nAt present he will be at College on Mondays\nand Tuesdays, 9.Cam.-6.0pm., but this will be\nextended to further days if there is the demand.\nUntil a wash-basin is installed, probably in the new year, the service will be haircutting\nonly, for which the charge is l/6d. Razor\nblades are on sale.\nGENERAL ELECTION\nThe next FEIIX appears on Friday 26th October,\nthe morning of the Election results, and will include\nnews of the latest results at sale time.\nFELIX SALES\nFELIX is on sale in the main entrances to the\nR.C.S., Guilds and Mines, the Huxley Building\nR.C.S., Guilds, Mines and the Huxley Building from\n9.30 - 10.15, and in the Hostel and Q.A. in the early\nmorning. During the day it is available in the Books tall, Bar and the Guilds' Library.\nKENYA SOCCER TOUR On July 26th. the London University Soccer\nClub party left London Airport to fly to Kenya\nfor a Tour of IB games at the invitation of the\nKenya Football Association. The party comprised\na Vice-President of the Club, myself, the Secretary, and 18 other players drawn from 8 Colleges.\nThe Tour covered 38 days on the Island of Zanzibar. Both games in Tanganyika were played at\nDar-es-Salaam, whilst the 15 In Kenya were spread\nover 7 at Nairobi, 4 at Momba^sa, 2 at Kisumu and\n2 at Nakuru. Of all these 10 were won, 3 drawn\nand 5 lost, with 49 goals scored against 20 - in all a very creditable performance considering\nthat at one stage 9 games were played in13 days'.\nMy reflections upon returning home are\ntwofold, from the social and from the football aspect. Most striking to a newcomer to thi3 part of the world la the presence of large\nnumbers of Indians as part of the population.\nThe white, or European, com rm in lt les are small and\nsomewhat isolated, and as a result their way of\nlife is con a ider ably freer than ours, aided and\nabetted by the absence of the austerities of the\npresent day British Isles. , The cost of living is slightly higher, but offsetting this are the\nconsiderably higher salaries and the much lower\nincome tax rate - maximum 3/6d. in the \u00a31. A non-graduate teacher, for instance, would commence at a salary some \u00a3300 higher than his counterpart here at home. Much has been done to\neducate and house the African native, but it is a slow and laborious undertaking, and apart from\nthe immediate surrounds of towns, he remains with\nall his inheritances but savagery and cannibal is e. Writing of the native brings to mind the\nfootball out there, for of the 18 games played,\nbut 5 were against all-white teams, the rest were\nagainst African or Asian sides. It was the\nAfrican style of play that required some change\nof tactics from the normal method of play, for\nall Africans play barefooted, and as a result, at first there was some hesitancy to treat the\nbare foot as the booted foot would be treated l Accordingly the African had the opportunity to\nget to the ball and then use his outstanding\nspeed and agility to full effect. But having\ndiscovered the right tactics to overcome this,\nthe problem became less' acute, for the African\nhas no strategical brain, his football is stereotyped and he cannot adapt it to suit con-di tio us. But it was an experience to watch them,\nand on occasions to control their games, one\nwhich will remain with me for always.\nW.P. Goss.\nCOMMEMORATION BALL\n-B. S.M.

He have\nnot produced a Freshers' issue, filling our pages\nwith exhortations to rally round, keep the flag\nflying, etc., etc., since this would be unfair to\nour established readers, nevertheless, we take\nthis opportunity of urging every Freshman to take\nsome part in Student activities.\nThe aim of this paper is to provide an inde-pendent, objective view, unbiased by sectional interests - this can only be done properly if the\ndifferent shades of opinion are communicated to us,\n(preferably in writing). Letters, articles, suggestions and comments, of a provocative nature are\nparticularly welcome, but please try to make your\ncontribution a constructive one. \"The Hops\",\n\"Culture at I.C.\", and \"Social colours\" were the\nsubjects most hotly contested last year; no doubt\nother controversies will arise in the future -Felix thrives on them jJ Although Felix caters primarily for hone con-sump tion, many copies are sent to past students\nboth at home and abroad.

He waits\nBespectful, eagar, while with sage lyn odA von er able nth year man orates.\nLet's walk up, gentle reader, and inquire\nWhat makes the young man tremble so with joy,\nWhat makes his eyes light up with noble fire.\nBut hark! The grey beard speaks. He says, \"\nMy boy.\nyou'll b~e \u2014\nhire at least a~~ ye~ar7 And though June is very near\nThere rsa lot of time to fill in on the way, So you'd batter join some clubs,\nCat to know the local pubs And learn what student life is like today.\nThese scars upon my arm,\n(\nThough they're really not much harm) Last year on Putney towpath-Morphy Day Got a pair of flannel bags Off a Miner dressed in rags\nBut you should hava seen the one that got away jOur rowdy weakly Hops And the melee s with the cops\nAnd the Guy Fawkes Bonfire on the Hectors lawn.\nIf you're with u aT good for you\nYou're our comrades brava and true,\nIf you're not you merit nothing but our scorn.\nThere are lots of things to do But they all depend on you So for Gods sake don't brown bag and stay away If you won't lend your support\n(\nAnd you definitely ought)\nThen our social life will wither and decay.\"\nThese words of wor i'i ly wisdom smote the youth\nHe turned away, his moist eyes focused far\nBut the vat aran, delivered of his truth\nFelt sudden thirst and led him to the bar.\nMESS RS BROWN a BROWNER It is becoming distressingly apparent that the\npresent system of recognition of student achieve-ment by the student Unions is most inefficient and\nbiased. At present only those who are giants in\nthe field of athletics gain honour.\nNo thought is given to that increasingly large\nproportion of students who would very much like to\nf cari loi pate in the: joyful activities \"if only\nthey had the time\", men who work.hard both ay day\nand by night.\nI would therefore suggest that a new club be formed, in the manner of the other august clubs,\nfor those students who have \"never done anything for\nthe College\". The number would have tobe strictly\nlimited and to effect this a point system could be introduced: say,\u201410 pts. for attending the Annual\nSports,\u2014\u00a7 pts. for going to a hop,+15 for going to\nlectures, and so on. The holding of any Union\noffice ot the gaining of colours would immediately\nd lsw u ali fy members. Kaon term a list of members, elected by pop Jalar vote in each college, could be prominently displayed on the notice boards, and the club tie,under\npain of the usual'penalties, worn on Thursdays and Fridays.\nK.P. QUEENIE'S REBORN\nThe Ayrton Hall refectory on the first floor\nof the Unwin building will already be familiar to\nmembers of the College. It is a greatly enlarged\n'Queenie's', the ref eo tory run for many years by\nMrs. Bohling in the south extension of Guilds. The main entrance to the building, (the old Royal College of Needlework), is in the Imperial Institute\nRoad, opposite the Post Office. Another entrance\nis just round the corner in Exhibition Hoad, and there is also a route from the ground floor of\nGuilds. The new hall is of a size comparable to\nthe College refectory in the Union building, and\nwill cater for 200-300 persons. It is hoped that\nit will ease the lunch-time load on the other re-fec tory. On the second floor is the Guilds Library and\nin one corner of this will be found the new home of\nthe Union Library. The latter will be open between\none and two o 'clock, and between five ana six.\nHowever, through the cooperation of Mr. James, the\nGuilds Librarian, it will also be possible to bor-row books during the Guilds Library hours, viz:\nten to five, Mondays to Fridays.\nA more detailed survey of the Ayrton Hall refectory and the Un v/ in building will appear shortly\nin the PHOENIX REVIEW.( Continued from page1.) Geoff. Fishwick found himself a summer sinecure\non the toe of Italy. In his own words \"Its no place for heels'.\nJoe Rawicz reached Finland, and the other\nScandinavian countries received a good quota of\nvisitors from the College. In July the Athletic\nClub sent a team to Denmark where they had a very\nsuccessful tour. Four members of the mountaineering club spent a strenuous time scrambling on the\npeaks of the Dauphine Alps.\nPerhaps the most original holiday was spent\nnearer home by the members of next year's Expedition to Africa. They went on a 'pilot' expedition\nto Holy Island, a barren uninhabited isle east of\nthe Scottish Arran, for the pur pot e of testing\ntheir comp a tibi li ties and ropes.\nThis report would he incomplete without\nmention of those seasoned 'voyageurs' who travelled hopefully but didn't arrive - or if they did,\nhave somehow escaped our notice. We offer them our condolences and apologies respectively.\n\n"
