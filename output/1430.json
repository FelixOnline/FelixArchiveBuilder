Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nIslam Awareness Week 2009 -The Five Pillars\nSome of you were in on it. Many of you experienced it. Now, Saira Wariach will let you all find out what\nThe Game was all about as Islamic Society host their Islam Awareness Week\nT\nhe 2nd-6th March was\nIslam Awareness Week\nat Imperial. There were\nstalls throughout the week\noffering henna, calligraphy and just a little enlightenment as to\nwhat was REALLY going on. 2009 saw\na fresh approach to this annual event.\nEach pillar of Islam was uncovered as\nthe week unfolded:\nMonday - Declaration of Faith\nWe started the week with the first pillar of Islam \u2013 Faith in One God, and in\nMuhammad (Peace be upon him), his\nfinal messenger.\nResonating with Reason was a discussion panel of three student converts\nto Islam \u2013 all from very different cultural backgrounds. It aimed to retrace\neach of their individual journeys, while\nat university, that had led them to recognise this faith as their own.\nThe panel comprised of Nicole\nAhmed, who found Islam at Imperial\nafter being raised without a faith in a\nBangladeshi family; Fatin Phang, a Chinese Malay, currently doing her PhD\nat Cambridge University; and Hamza\nTzortzis, originally a Greek Orthodox\nChristian, who lectures internationally\non Islam, philosophy and politics. The\nvenue was packed, there were even\npeople on the stairs (don\u2019t tell Health\nand Safety).\nThe audience raised their own\nquestions during a very successful 45\nminute Q&A session. Many stayed behind afterwards for refreshments and\ndiscussions with speakers and ISoccers\n\u2013 which is what it was all about in the\nend. Conversation, education, and mutual respect; the perfect beginning to\nthe week.\nTuesday - Charity\nA fundraiser BBQ for Save the Children was held in Beit between 4-7pm.\nAs well as tasty food for the enjoyment\nof all students on campus, this provided a great opportunity to encourage\nstudents around campus to pose questions and learn about Islam from quizzes and discussion. Over 150 burgers\nwere sold, and all revenue went to Save\nthe Children. A lot of students even\nbraved the rain near the end and had\na great time.\nWednesday \u2013 Hajj Pilgrimage\nMalcolm X has been an inspiration to\nmany revolutionaries over the years,\nand his life has been taken as a model\nfor many ordinary people looking to\nchange their lives and the community\naround them. IAW was a platform on\nwhich we brought the great personality\nto Imperial\u2019s attention, and what influenced him to develop such morals and\nvalues.\nA talk on Malcolm X, highlighting\nthe influence Islam had on the latter\nyears of his life, after he had performed\nthe pilgrimage to Makkah, was conducted by Sheikh Ahmed Babiki (who\nhas recently been involved in similar\nevents alongside Malcolm X\u2019s daughter Malikah Shabazz). He gave a brief\noverview of Malcolm\u2019s life before focusing in detail on some of the ideals\nfor justice he so strongly held, bringing\nto people\u2019s attention the highly-preju-diced society within which he developed those ideals.\nFree pizza was a great attraction and\nan opportunity for discussion, with\nabout 120 people attending overall.\nPeople left feeling inspired, and curi-ous; not only about Malcolm X, but\nabout the teachings of Islam.\nThursday - Fasting\nAs Muslims, we are obliged to fast for a\nwhole month, Ramadan. During IAW,\nwe challenged people to try fasting for\na day, from dawn till dusk, and then\nto break their fast with delicious food,\ngreat company, an inspiring talk and\nentertainment. The event was publicised as \u2018Fast and Feast\u2019 and was held\nfrom 5.30pm in SAF.\nThe event started on time, with a\nturnout of about 150+, one of the biggest turnouts of IAW, about a quarter\nnon-Muslims. Almost all the Muslims,\nand about 10 non-Muslims, took up the\nchallenge and tried fasting on that day.\nParticipants shared their experience\nand views about fasting, and improved\ntheir understanding. They learnt that\nit is not only abstaining from food and\ndrink, but includes a more spiritual as-pect, as well as self discipline.\nThe event continued with a talk by\nImam Ajmal Masroor on the topic\n\u201cThe relevance of acts of worship in\ntoday\u2019s Society\u201d and a performance\nby our very own Imperial Nasheed\nGroup.\nBefore the event, the sunset prayer\nwas held in congregation on the SAF\nconcourse, and witnessed by many\nnon-Muslims who were curious to see\nthe final pillar\u2026\nFriday - Prayer\nThe weekly congregational prayer was\nalso held as usual, at Friday lunchtime,\nin the Union Building.\nAs the last day in IAW, Friday needed a spectacle. It had to encompass\nall five pillars from the week, yet still\nbe less academic and more fun than\nthe talks preceding it. It had to be a\npantomime.\nOr so they thought! The EndGame\nevent was publicised as an \u2018evening\nof entertainment\u2019. However, there was\na top-secret performance kept under\nwraps until the show itself. The mantra\nof which was to truly surprise the audi-ence, bending their perceptions while\nconveying the pillars in so subliminal\na way that Derren Brown would be\nfooled.\nThe event proved successful. However,thedetailscannotberevealedincase\nthe clamoured-for repeat performance\nis honoured. This is no hyperbole, the\nshow is probably like nothing ISoc has\never done before\u2026 and was a mission\nwell accomplished.\nA successful term for\nImperial\u2019s Dance Company\nW\nhat a month February was for Dance\nCompany! Two\ncompetitions, a\nguest performance\nand eight awards\u2026.\nThe competition season started two\nweeks ago when five dance teams travelled up to Loughborough University,\namidst snow-covered fields, to strut\ntheir stuff at the Loughborough Dance\nCompetition 2009 for the very first\ntime. Full of anticipation and high ex-pectations, our beginner ballet, beginner tap, advanced ballet, contemporary and jazz dancers took to the stage\nto dazzle more than 20 universities in\nfront of a 400+ strong audience.\nCompetition was fierce with such a\nhigh level of dancing on display, but\nthat did not distract us from our goal.\nAfter a long, exhilarating day and having taken part in the Nokia Tube Dance\nat lunchtime, our efforts were certainly\nrewarded. Our sparkling, sophisticated\nbeginner tap dancers and beautiful beginner ballerinas (choreography by\nFumiyo Nakagawa and Louisa Brown\nrespectively) both pipped the post winning first place in each of their catego-ries. Additionally the elusive advanced\ncontemporary entry (choreography by\nElisa Bellomo) and the talented advanced ballerinas (choreography by\nLouisa Brown) were awarded second\nand joint third place respectively. The\nhigh energy, star-struck, advanced jazz\ndance (choreographed by Hildur Einarsd\u00f3ttir) just missed out on a place in\nthe highest subscribed category of the\ncompetition.\nAfter such a successful day at Loughborough spirits were high for the Edinburgh Dance-Off, a competition that\nImperial has made their mark on over\nmany years. Here, we saw the arrival\nof our sixth dance team, the sexy advanced tappers (choreography by Zo\u00eb\nDobell), to form our biggest ever dance\ntroupe of 37 dancers! Having danced\nto the highest standard, the audience\n(and I) were wowed by Imperial\u2019s melange of acts.\nThis was reflected in the judge\u2019s decision to award first place to Imperial\nin the beginners/advanced ballet and\ncontemporary categories, and second\nplace to beginners tap. But the celebrations did not end there \u2013 two of our\nvery own dancers, Elisa Bellomo (win-ner of \u2018Best Dancer Award 2008\u2019) and\nAlvaro Feito Boirac, took to the stage\nto perform the last act of the day, their\noriginal guest piece based on a tale of\ntwo lovers.\nAfter such an ecstatic day, our celebrations commenced with food, drink\nand laughter, and continued by boogy-ing late into the night!\nClaire Stanley reviews the overwhelmingly successful term for\nDance Company, with prizes, dancing and celebrations galore,\nwhat more could you ask for?\nTop: Advanced Contemporary Team.

It annoys\nme because she has enough\nmusical talent to be suc-cessful, without all the \u201cI\u2019m\ncute and pissy, love me, love\nme please\u201d shit. There\u2019s too\nmuch to be annoyed about\nindividually, so here\u2019s a list:\nthe teacup, the eye-watering\nfringe, the post-it note dress\nthe piece of sellophane on her\nhead, and, and the \u2018I\u2019m too\ndamn cool for light mockery\u2019\nattitude. SHIT.\nSICK\nSHIT\nI\nt is hard to imagine the suited\nand belted multimillionaire\nwearing a pair of punk platform\nshoes. But it is true that he was\nonce so fond of them back in his\nfashionista days. The wise and charming businessman speaks of getting into\nfashion as if it is the most natural progression for him. His father was an apprentice at Burton, and the family went\non to start a small textile workshop in\nLondon. Mr. Tillman followed his father\u00eds footstep in fashion and spent\ntwo years at the London College of\nFashion.\nAfter graduation he took an internship with Lincroft on Savile Row,\nsewing suits for customers who were\n30 years his senior. In his spare time,\nhe would shop for cheap and stylish\nclothes on Carnaby Street in London.\nHe then started to design his own\nclothes and sell them in the tailor shop\nas well as taking them to Kings Road.\nAs his designs gathered popularity, his\nambitions grew and he eventually took\nLincroft onto the London Stock Exchange, at the tender age of 24.\nAs a young boy, Mr. Tillman would\nwalk around the Jaeger shop on Regent\nStreet with his parents. He adored the\ndesigns. Jaeger was in deep trouble in\nthe late 80s, losing \u00a312 million before\nbeing put on sale in 1990. Mr. Tillman\nacquired the company, \u00ecI had to have\nit\u00ee, he said. Under new establishment,\nJaeger immediately cut its losses to\n\u00a33.5 million the next year, and has seen\noperational profit of around \u00a31 million\nin 2008.\nWhen Mr. Tillman took over the\ncompany, he recognised the main reason for its failure; Jaeger was too quick\nto reinvent itself, and had lost a lot of\nits original supporters. After he gaining control of the company, he put\nJaeger back in tune with the designs\nthat have made the company famous.\nA lot of fans have since re-embraced\nthe brand. Mr. Tillman then went on\nput out a new line, Jaeger London, to\nattract the original fan\u2019s daughters.\nJaeger Children is now on the drawing\nboard, an attempt to attract the grandchildren as well.\nHow does Mr. Tillman position\nJaeger in the current economic cli-mate? \u201cI\u2019d like to call it a downturn,\nnot a recession,\u201d he smiles. He sees the\ndownturn as a chance to create more\nopportunities, a chance to focus on\ngiving customers what they want.\n\u201cAlthough it might seem like people\nare spending less, they are actually\ninvesting in quality products.\u201d He believes that the quick-buy philosophy\ncannot last forever, and the best combat strategy is to keep up the qualities\nof his products.\nThe secret behind Mr. Tillman\u2019s success is \u201cbelief\u201d. He believed in his vision and went ahead to design his first\ncollection when he was doing an internship at Lincroft. The creative and\nproducible collection enabled his first\ncommercial success. Although it might\ncome as a cruel fact for some cutting-edge designers, commercial success\nusually stems from authentic products that do not lose their \u201ccommercial\nflair\u201d, with products appealling to the\nmass market in its own niche.\nMr. Tillman thinks that designers\nshould focus on their ability to build\na collection. The cross between creative design and entrepreneurship can\ncause a designer to lose his flair. Forming business collaborations is the way\nforward.\nWhen asked how to find the suitable\nbusiness partner, Mr. Tillman admits\nthat there is no perfect formula. He\nalso understands the difficulty for designers starting up their new business-es. As a London College of Fashion\ngraduate, he has pledged \u00a31 million to\nsponsor 10 MAs every year at the LCF.\nIn addition, as a chairman for the British Fashion Council, he has pioneered\na BFC fashion fund with Vogue to support designers financially and to give\nthem business mentoring.\nTop fashion journalist Hilary Alexander was suitably frustrated with\nthe locations of the shows during the\nFashion Week. She missed enough\nshows last season that she wrote on\nher blog to vent her disappointment\nabout the impossibility of getting from\nshows to shows across central London\nand Paris. As the top man of the BFC,\nMr. Tillman has announced that the\nLondon Fashion Week tent is to be\nmoved from its current location at\nthe Natural History Museum to the\nSomerset House next season. He\nhopes that the larger venue can\naccommodate the majority of\nthe catwalk shows.\nIt is without a doubt that\nLondon has become one of\nthe most interesting and\nsuccessful fashion capitals\nin the world. The two designers that have collaborated with the global high-street fashion house. H&M, in the past\ntwo seasons were both British - Stella\nMcCartney and Matthew Williamson.\nThe February London Fashion Week\nhas also seen a record attendance. Mr.\nTillman believes that the brilliant British talents have attracted more fans to\nthe UK\u2019s fashion industry. The forward\nthinking fashion mogul hopes that\nthe BFC can acquire a more respectable stature in the UK and that also\nit will become an organisation which\nreceives the same level of professional\nrecognition as in other countries such\nas France and the US. With some government support, there can\nperhaps exist a\nthriving garment manufacturing industry here,\njust like Italy.\nY\no, so I went to the Design\nMuseum; it was waste. I\njest. But I seriously did go\nthere to see the exhibition\non fashion designer Hussein Chalayan.\nI will say it now, if you want to see\nsome gash, go to this exhibition. It also\nhas video installations featuring Tilda\nSwinton, though thankfully not her\ngash.\nVulgarity aside, the runway show\nprojected as part of the tour does show\none piece where the model is wearing\na hat; this hat looks like some kind of\n1960\u2019s UFO and the dress she is wearing originates from said hat. The dress\nis subsequently abducted by the hat\nand the model stands naked in the\nmiddle of the runway while the other\nmodels parade.\nSome of the clothes that did not remove themselves were simply divine\n(insert flamboyant hand gestures).\nThere was one ruffled dress, entirely\ncompact tulle ruffles. I had to touch it!\nI got told off for doing so, but totally\nworth it. However, my experience was\nsomewhat tainted hence forth; due to\nthe cripplingly fragile nature of my\npsyche being unable to brush off this\nmicro-humiliation.\nOnwards, you are transported to a\nworld of cone heads dressed as puritanical executioners, or at least I think\nthat is what the designer intended to\nconjure, alternatively\u2026 I am wrong.\nAnother interesting dress I felt\ncompelled to touch, (this was prior\nto the \u201cexcuse me, please do not\ntouch the garments\u201d episode, while\nI was on a fabric induced high) was\na rubber dress. It appeared to have\nbeen moulded while under some\nextreme G-force, forcing the rubber\nto ripple backward as if the dress\nwere liquefying off the mannequin.\nApart from these, his most publicised crowd pleasers are the LED\ndress and the mechanical transformer dress. That should make\nsome Mechanical Engineers jizz in\ntheir pants.\nAftermarvellingatdresseswithbuiltin neck rests and an entirely carpeted\ncoat you are led to the video installation section. This would be the point\nwhere my appreciation and tolerance\nfor modern art falters slightly. People\nseem to get tied up in their own head\nwith this preoccupation for being odd\nor kooky. The screens show the aforementioned art-house-actress-turned-blockbuster-sellout, Tilda Swinton.\nShe plaits her hair. She unplaits her\nhair. She washes her clothes. She looks\nin the mirror. These images are juxtaposed with a seemingly unrelated dialogue discussing human DNA. I think\nit was meant to distort my perspective\nand provoke self reflection.\nFrom the quest for identity to Urban Outfitters?! Yes, it is that small a\nleap. Hussain Chalayan has put out a\nready-to-wear line of uniquely constructed garments currently stocking\nat UO, so go and piss your money up\nthe wall there, I do all the time. I love\nthat place.\nI fear I have belittled this mans crea-tions; in fact I love them all. If I could\npersonify and romance them, I would.\nBasically, go to the exhibition.\nHussein Chalayan exhbition at the\nDesign Museum runs until 17th\nMay. You have two weeks.\nOh la la la la, it\u2019s Chalayan!\nVicki Masding risked her life to touch Hussein Chalayan\u2019s gorgeous designs at the\nDesign Museum. You\u2019ll be glad to know she escaped alien abduction\nAlien abduction and lasers. Sci-Fi\nSociety\u2019s dream girl.\n\n"

It is however far from\nplaying out long held fantasies of being\na doctor in the world of ER or Grey\u2019s\nAnatomy. Instead, it is a step by step\nexercise in patient care and treatment\nmanagement.\nA virtual hospital has been set-up\nand designed to look like Imperial\u2019s\nown real-life facilities where everything is made to mimic the actual experience of being on a hospital ward.\nEven online versions of members of\nstaff bear an eerie resemblance to their\nreal-life appearance.\nFrom the comfort of a classroom,\nstudents can log into the virtual medical world and transport their avatars\nto the computer-generated hospital.\nThere they check in at a reception\ndesk, put on an access badge and pick\nup their assignment to begin work. If\nan assignment takes place in a respiratory ward, students have access to\nrecordings of real-life patients\u2019 breathing to help with their diagnoses. And\nif it is decided that x-rays are needed,\nthey can stroll down to the radiology department and order them. The\nidea is to think through the tests and\ntreatments in the same way that a doctor would and reinforce lessons about\nresponsibility and hospital protocol.\nStudents even have to virtually wash\ntheir hands before visiting a patient,\notherwise their investigation is halted\nand they lose points. If advice, help or\na friendly chat is needed, students can\ncommunicate with their professors\nand other colleagues within the world\nthrough their avatars.\nAs enjoyable as playing doctors may\nsound, this game-based learning does\nnot aim to replace traditional face-to-face training or the experiences gained\nfrom walking the wards of real hospitals and interacting with real patients.\nThe 3D virtual world cannot replicate\nor convey real human emotion, distress\nor suffering nor teach how to effectively deal with it. And apparently avatars\ncan\u2019t be killed. In the world of Second\nLife there is even a simple mute button\nthat can be clicked to silence any people you may wish to ignore- if only real\nlife were that easy.\nAlthough the program is not part of\nthe medical school\u2019s official curriculum\nquite yet, in the future, educators see it\nas a new way of learning for students\nthat also taps into their sophisticated\nand savvy computer skills.\n\u201cThe aim is to develop a more engaging learning environment\u201d said\nMaria Toro-Troconis, a senior learning technologist. \u201cYou\u2019d like to say\nthis makes learning fun and easy,\u201d says\nJenny Higham, head of undergraduate\nmedicine, \u201c[but] at the end of the day,\nthere\u2019s still a basic requirement to learn\nthe facts.\u201d\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nPresident Sarkozy has opened an exhibition containing ten projects by\ninternational architects which outline their vision for Paris in 2029.\nSarkozy\u2019s grand plan is for a greener city, and the ten options include radical ideas like a monorail network, recycling stations buried beneath parkland\nand local power generation.\nNicknamed the \u201cCity of Light\u201d, Paris is usually defined as everything within\nthe p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique or ring road, giving it an official population of two million\npeople. But the French capital is surrounded by a plethora of suburbs and\ntowns administered by separate county councils and inhabited by a further\nsix million people.\nPressure has been growing to merge some of the neighbouring councils\ntogether into something akin to the Greater London Authority for London\u2019s\neight million inhabitants. While Sarkozy is pushing for this, he is opposed by\nthe Socialist Party which is in office in most of the councils and which support the decentralisation.\nFrance\nDavid Kellermann, acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of US mortgage\ngiant Freddie Mac, was found hung in his basement after apparently\ncommitting suicide.\n41-year old Mr Kellermann had worked for Freddie Mac for 16 years, beginning in his mid-twenties as a financial ana-lyst, and rising through the ranks of the cor-poration. The death was reported by his wife\nat their home in eastern state of Virginia.\nFreddie Mac is a private corporation that\ndeals with financial services, namely owning\nor guaranteeing mortgages. In September\n2008, to prevent it from collapsing, the US\nFederal Government took over control of the\ncorporation, and appointed Kellermann as the\nCFO. But recently Freddie Mac\u2019s losses have\nspiralled out of control, and Mr Kellermann\u2019s\ncolleagues reported that he had been working\nlong hours.\nUSA\nJacob Zuma is expected to become South Africa\u2019s next president on the\n6th of May, after his party the African National Congress won 66% of the\nvote in the general elections.\nA controversial figure, Jacob Zuma is a former guerrilla fighter and was an\ninmate at Robben Island prison alongside Nelson Mandela. For years he has\nbeen embroiled in legal battles on allegations of corruption and fraud, which\nhave only recently been dropped \u2013 on a technicality.\nDespite his many flaws, Mr Zuma is undoubtedly a man of remarkable\nqualities. And qualities he will need if he is to lead a country which contributes a third of the 48 sub-Saharan economies\u2019 GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Too many African countries have collapsed because of leaders who view\ngovernment as a means of accumulating power and dispensing favours. Mr\nZuma needs to show that South Africa, a beacon of hope for a continent of a\nbillion souls, can still lead the way.\nSouth Africa\nNATO and Russia have restored formal diplomatic contacts, eight\nmonths after they were suspended over the five day war with Georgia in\nAugust 2008.\nThe 28 members of the NATO military alliance met with a Russian envoy\nin Brussels on Wednesday 29th April. A NATO spokesman said that disagreement continued over Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia (which has been promised NATO membership), and NATO\u2019s planned military exercises there next\nmonth. But significant progress had been made on the Conventional Forces\nin Europe Treaty, which aims at limiting the number of tanks and other conventional military equipment between the Atlantic and the Ural mountains.\nNATO decided to gradually resume its ties with Russia, especially on issues such as nuclear non-proliferation, the war in Afghanistan, and the fight\nagainst terrorism, but emphasized that neither should shy away from issues\non which they fundamentally disagree.\nRussia\n\u2018UCL\u2019 shits all over Imperial\nDan Wan\nEditor-in -Prowling\nAfter years of Imperial shitting all over\n\u2018UCL\u2019 in the league tables, \u2018UCL\u2019 have\nfinally \u2018shat\u2019 back in a fashion befitting\nto their intellect, and the only tables involved were snooker tables.\nDuring the closing days of the Spring\nterm, the Union snooker rooms were\nbroken into and heavily vandalised;\nincluding the deposition of faeces on\nsnooker tables. The tables and walls\nwere also targeted. Graffiti included\nseveral ambiguous but aggressive mes-sages, such as \u201cfuck off\u201d and \u201cc*nt\u201d. To\nwhom these messages were targeted is\nstill not clear, but it is thought that the\nunruly depictions of genitalia are to\nprovide clues.\nA carefully constructed structure\nmade of broken snooker cues, triangles and a chair was also erected on\ntop of an uncovered snooker table.\nIts delightful centrepiece featured an\nimpressively large piece of excrement.\nThe owners were seemingly so pleased\nwith their creation, they decided to\nsign their name beneath it; the letters\n\u2018UCL\u2019 were found painted onto the\ntable felt with an unidentified white\nsubstance, thought to be paint or glue.\nAfter a month of headstratching, felix\nhave finally identified the meaning of\nthe letters as Bloomsbury Community\nCollege\u2019s lesser used name of \u2018University College London\u2019.\nHowever, Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) Lily Topham, has raised her\ndoubts that the defacement was work\nof UCL students.\n\u201cI\u2019m doubtful as to whether it was\nactually UCL or our students trying to\nput the blame on someone else \u2013 there\nis absolutely no solid evidence to suggest who it was.\u201d Miss Topham duly\nnoted the absence of 3rd floor video\nsurveillance.\n\u201cThis incidence has highlighted the\nproblems with security \u2013 particularly\non the upper floors of the Union, be-cause, although the Union has investigated available CCTV footage and\nquestioned stewards on duty during\nthat night, there is no CCTV on the top\nfloor of the building and during busy\nnights it is very difficult to track every\nperson in the Union building who takes\nit into their head to do damage.\u201d She\nalso reassured us that the Union Building\u2019s security was also under \u201cwholescale review\u201d for the new term.\nThe faeces was thought not be of\nhuman origin, and is reckoned to be\nsheep\u2019s, by the well-proven investigative method of scratch\u2019n\u2019sniff. After\nextensive examination of Beit Quad\nCCTV however, there were no sightings of any farm animals within the\nUnion compound.\nThe snooker rooms, which are found\non the 3rd floor of the Union Building\nin Beit Quad, were thought to have\nbeen infiltrated between 22:30 and\nmidnight after a play held in the Union\nConcert Hall on the 20th of March.\nA witness to the aftermath voiced\nhis concerns with the motives of the\nvandals. \u201cIt is immensely worrying on\ntwo levels. Who\u2019s carrying around a\nbag of shit purely to deposit its contents on a table? If not, who would\nbring a poor farmyard animal into the\ndepths of London and have it shit all\nover a snooker table?\u201d Another stu-dent, who wished not to be named,\nalso described the Union\u2019s third floor\nas \u201csmelly as fuck\u201d. felix concurs with\nboth witnesses. The damaged snooker\ntables have since been relayed with new\nfelt. Topham assured that the damage\nwould not be inflicted on the Snooker\nClub financially.\n\u201cAs soon as the scene was discovered\nwe informed the club and to ensure\nthat they wouldn\u2019t suffer materially\nfrom these actions. The Clubs and Societies Board had unanimously voted\nto fund the refelting of the vandalised\nsnooker tables from Contingency,\nhowever, Sport Imperial very kindly\noffered to help as well, so my sincere\nthanks to Neil Mosley [Head of Sport\nImperial] for his support.\u201d\nTopham went on to condemn the\npeople responsible for the vandalism\n\u201cWhoever did this needs serious psychological counselling if they think\nthat was they did was funny or acceptable behaviour.\u201d\nAt the end of the Spring term, another similar incident occurred in the\ninflatable laser quest in Beit Quad,\nwhere it was found that an individual\nhad left some excrement in one of the\ncorners. As a result, the attraction was\nshut early so that the problem could be\ndealt with.\nThus far, the Union is dealing these\nas two separate incidents.\nNews in Brief\nGreen Week competition winner\nICU RAG Mag: Funny and Free!\nSwine Flu hits the World, hard!\nThe winners of Imperial College Union\u2019s \u2018Greening Imperial\u2019 competition are announced online today, with two students sharing the \u00a31000\nprize.

To everyone\u2019s surprise it\nwas two senior members of the ACC\nthat managed to fail at this, notably\nthis year\u2019s Hockey Club Captain and\nnext year\u2019s ACC Chair!\nAll present and correct, the triple\ntrain journey to Aachen in Germany\nwas followed by a festival atmosphere.\nAachen\u2019s fantastic sports centre was\nbased in the west of the suburban area\nwith views across the historic spa city.\nAfter a introductory lunch, many of\nthe party chose to explore the town,\nonly for a call to come thought that ladies were needed to play table-tennis.\nTeddy Middlebrook was selected as she\nhad her own table at home, and Izzy\nSmith went along to join her as everyone else ran off. Results were rather\nbetter than expected with the men\nand women winning many games, but\neventually coming 3rd. As the epic ta-Continued on page 25\nTim Simpson\nKendo club find national success\nAs with all competitions the day starts\nwith an ungodly noise- that of the\nalarm clock at an abnormally early\ntime of the morning. On this day, the\n4th of April and the day of the National University Kendo Competition,\nthe alarm sounded about 4.45am. That\nis the spirit of commitment shown by\nyour very own kendo club. By 5.50am\nthe competitors were all huddled in\nVictoria ready for the first train of the\nday to Canterbury where the fight was\ngoing to be hosted by the good boys\nand girls of the University of Kent.\nA smaller competition than last year,\nafter Cambridge Kendo Club made a\nmess of the timings and enraged judges\nfrom as far afield as Japan, only 8 University teams were to take part. These\nincluded teams from Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford and UCL- so all our\nold rivals were back yet again.\nHowever before the main competition there was the kyu-grade individuals for those lower down the food chain\nthan the black belt (\u2018Dan grades\u2019). Six\nof our team went that show. Of special\ninterest were two of last year\u2019s beginners and some of this year\u2019s club stal-warts, Benny Wong and Danny Mak.\nWong had some cracking fights which\nincluded the first having an encho (ex-tra time, 1st score wins) that was at\nleast double the length of the actual\nmatch itself. The star of this particular\nshow, however, was Danny Mak. Mak\nmanaged to win three fights outright\nwith a mixture of kote (wrist) and men\n(head) cuts before losing out to a kote\nfrom a 10 year kendo veteran who belongs to the Mumeishi club. That club,\nbased outside of London, is rich in Japanese kendoka, and has our very own\nYoda in residence, Yoshikawa-sensei,\nas one of their teachers.\nFollowing soon after the kyu grade\nbouts were the Dan grade competition and the ladies competition (for all\nranks). Imperial only had one competitor for each. Tin Wong was the man up\nagainst it all in the Dan grade competition but he came acropper with two\nmen cuts received from a very athletic opponent. Rachel Soon tried her\nhand against two opponents both her\nsenior in terms of experience but lost\nout to the eventual winner of the ladies fight, T. Volkata, from Edinburgh\nUniversity.\nAfter these warm up \u201cexercises\u201d the\nmain competition took place. This involved 5 kendoka from each Uni team\ngoing to head-to-head in a set of individual bouts. Imperial\u2019s first match was\nagainst Oxford. Of the fights two were\ndraws with Tin Wong and Christos Argryakis holding their own, whilst Ali\nHammad and Daniel Mak won their\ntussles with a men cut and a kote re-spectively. The second set of matches\nagainst Edinburgh went less well. Unfortunately Edinburgh\u2019s team of ninja\n(with two newly arrived Japanese ken-doka, including a 5th dan) managed\nto overcome some spirited defences\nalthough notably Tin Wong managed\nto hold that bundle of vicious feminin-ity, T.

I\nwent on Sunday which was apparently\nquieter but still fairly populated. It was\nalso nice to see my old pals from previous shows surrounded by big crowds,\nnamely Pacemaker and DIGISKIN.\nWhat made The Gadget Show Live so\nunique were the many special features\nnot found in most of other electronics\nshows: the spectacular stage shows at\nthe \u201cGadget Show Super Theatre\u201d, the\n\u201cHow To Theatre\u201d where independent\nexperts teach you how to get the most\nout of your gadgets, and the many\nhands-on opportunities with gadgets as small as webcams to as big as a\nfighter jet. Yes, they somehow managed to land a Red Arrow in the convention hall, courtesy of the RAF. No\ntest flights though, sadly, but there was\na \u201cGadget Test Track\u201d where I test-drove an awesome electric bicycle.\nEven though the show was mainly for\ncompanies to promote their products,\nThe Gadget Show Live had a dedicated\narea for antique computers and mobile phones from the last thirty years,\ncourtesy of The Centre for Computing\nHistory. Most machines were switched\non for attendees to play with, the most\npopular ones being Atari\u2019s Pong, the\nApple II and the original Sony Playstation. It was every gadget-lover\u2019s\nfantasyland.\nThere is no doubt that I\u2019ll be back\nnext year. Keep it up, guys!\nThe Gadget Show Live \u201809\nRichard Lai travels north to check out the TV show\u2019s first ever exposition.\nDell Adamo\nFrom \u00a31,649, www.dell.co.uk\nMindflex - a mind control game\nVeho USB\nMicroscopes\nIf you don\u2019t have any spare USB ports\non your computers, you should look\naway now: Veho is a UK company\nwhich specialises in interesting USB\nproducts. The most interesting one\nwas their USB Microscope line (pic-tured left), starting from \u00a359.99 for\ntheir VMS-001 model (1.3 megapixels,\n20x-200x magnification). Their more\nexpensive VMS-004 (\u00a369.99) features\na more powerful 20x-400x magnifica-tion, but the 2-megapixel resolution is\nonly achieved by interpolation.\nAnother special product from Veho\nis the \u201cmuvi\u201d (pictured right), which\nis officially the world\u2019s smallest cam-corder. This \u00a380 tiny package has a\n2-megapixel sensor, and comes with a\n2GB microSD card (about two to three\nhours of recording). You can upgrade it\nto 8GB maximum too.\nTo my surprise, PC World had a pretty\nimpressive-looking stall at the show,\nbut it wouldn\u2019t change my distaste of\nthe chain store. They did, however,\nshowcased the Adamo, a new premium line of laptops from Dell.\nThis MacBook-like laptop recently\ncaused some stir in the computer industry because of its diamond-studded\nprice tag. Since last Saturday, PC World\nstarted offering the said laptop for just\nunder \u00a31,700, but eagle-eyed readers\nmight have noticed that you could save\n\u00a350 if you buy direct from Dell\u2019s web-site. What a bargain!\nDon\u2019t have high expectations though:\nthis 64-bit Vista, 13\u201d portable only has\na 1.20GHz CPU, 2GB 800MHz DDR3\nRAM, 128GB SSD and just a 1-year\n\u201cPremium Warranty Support\u201d. The\nbuild quality and weight (1.81kg) could\nbe better for the price too. If you\u2019ve\njust won the lottery as well, go for the\n\u00a32,249 model (1.4GHz, 4GB RAM).\nThis could well be the puzzle of the\nyear: the objective of the British-made\nReVoMaze is to guide the shaft out of\nan internal maze (no map given, of\ncourse), and if you fall into a trap you\nmust start from the beginning again.\nThe idea is that you have to memorise\nthe path, and then work on the speed.\nI had a go on the blue one - the entry model - and had no success. If your\nmemory and speed is better than mine,\nyou can then upgrade to the advanced\ngreen model which has just come out.\nThree more harder models will be released throughout the year.\nPart of that slightly large price tag\nactually goes towards an accumulating\nprize fund for the national ReVoMaze\ncompetition. To enter, all you need to\ndo is visit their website and register\nyour unique number etched on the\nshaft. So far they have gathered just\nover \u00a32,170 in the pot, which will be\nshared between winners of each of the\nfive categories at the live event. Surely\none of them should be a bright student\nfrom Imperial?\nReVoMaze\n\u00a369.99, www.revomaze.co.uk\nSmoking is bad for you, m\u2019kay? Well,\nit depends. Regular smokers might\nwant to consider the realistic-looking\nbut much healthier electronic cigarette\nfrom Cigstar. You will still be getting\nyour doses of nicotine bar the tar, and\nthey come in many flavours too (to-bacco, Marlboro, menthol, chocolate\nand vanilla). What\u2019s best is that each \u00a31\ncapsule is equivalent to 15 to 20 ciga-rettes! The \u00a335 starter kit will therefore\nlast you for a while with its 6 capsules.\nEven though e-cigarettes sound\ndorky, you wouldn\u2019t see the dif-ference: the head glows gently\nwhen you inhale, and you puff\nout what appears to be smoke\n- it\u2019s just water vapour! This\nmeans you can now \u201csmoke\u201d in nonsmoking areas!\nThere are no health issues to worry about: the e-cigarette has been\ntested by New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of\nHealth, and apparently soon to be\nconfirmed by the NHS. We will also\ntry to get hold of one for review, so\nstay tuned!\nCigstar\nFrom \u00a334.99, www.cigstar.co.uk\nBeing a bloke, I am naturally programmed to like my big toys, and I\nthink I\u2019ve just found a new favourite.\nOut of the many electric-bicycle makers in the show, Ultra Motor stood out\nwith their A2B Metro - the world\u2019s\nonly power-on-demand electric bicy-cle. The other electric bicycles only\nuse the motor for assistance instead of\nacceleration.\nSeeing that the show had a test track,\nI had a go on the Metro and loved\nevery second on it. Controlling the acceleration was just like using a normal\nmotorbike without the noise. The motor did respond with a slight delay, but\nthe acceleration was quick enough to\nremove my slight frustration.\nApparently under power the Metro\ncould travel up to 15.5mph, and on a\nsingle charge it has an unassisted range\nof up to 20 miles. However, if you do\nrun out of juice you\u2019ll be pushing a\n37kg bicycle on your own.\nSuch fun doesn\u2019t come cheap either:\nthe A2B Metro will cost you \u00a32,000,\nand even their power-assisted version,\nthe A2B Hybrid, goes for \u00a31,700.\nUltra Motor A2B\nFrom \u00a31,700, www.ultramotor.com\nNVIDIA is about to launch their 3D\ngraphics products in the UK. The technology is not as simple as you might\nthink: the supplied glasses are actually\nbattery-operated, and they respond\nto an infrared transmitter to flicker at\n60Hz. You then need a 120Hz screen,\nso that the graphics card can display\ntwo offset images at the right timing\n(but only one port is required from the\ncard). The glasses then block out one\nimage at each flicker to create the 3D\neffect.\nWhat you will see in PC World soon\nare some \u00a3330-\u00a3400 NVIDIA graphics\ncards that come with the 3D glasses and\nUSB transmitter, along with a range\nof 120Hz screens. If you already have\nthe NVIDIA 8800 GT or better cards,\nyou can get the glasses and transmitter\nalone for just \u00a3139, but don\u2019t forget the\nscreen!\nOn NVIDIA\u2019s website you will find a\nlist of 350+ tested games, and around\nhalf of them are rated \u201cvery good\u201d,\nuncluding \u201cFallout 4\u201d, \u201cLeft 4 Dead\u201d,\n\u201cGRID\u201d and \u201cMirror\u2019s Edge\u201d.

I\nobserved Anna from afar, now that she\nhad returned to her spot by the junction where traffic from the lorry park\nlivened. She was complaining to me\nabout the cold; I don\u2019t blame her. My\npalm seemed to be fixed in its thumbs-up gesture not because of my enthusiasm \u2013 it was simply frozen.\nSomething was going terribly wrong.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if the roundabout had\ndirected the traffic into different di-rections, one heading to Zaragoza/\nMadrid and another into Barcelona\n\u2013 there were hardly any vehicles going southwards. For those that were\nsouthbound, the merciless junction\npresented little room for stopping. The\nwait continued.\nI went over to Anna and gave her a\ncuddle, just for the sake of salvaging\nour morale. She was ready to give up\nand more keen on using public trans-port. With sleep deprivation kicking in,\nI feared that I would soon snap myself.\nHow had we managed thus far?\nAnna and I had set off from Clapham Junction four days ago, accepted\na lorry ride to Portsmouth to catch a\nferry bound for Caen, blitzed through\nNorthern France until Brive, where our\nluck expired. From there we inched to\nthe south of Toulouse. Rested, we attempted a border crossing via Andorra\nonly to find the mountain passes grid-locked with snow; several short hitches\nand much walker later we wound up in\nthe Spanish Pyrenees. Our fortune returned with a ride that took us across\nthe mountain range by nightfall. Having slept rough in a car park in the\nlorry park just outside of Lleida, Catalunya, we hoisted the cardboards on\nthe fifth day hours before the sun was\neven in sight.\nNot that me and Anna were the only\nones partaking in this bizarre, if not\ninsane, endeavour. Being the 18th of\nits kind, the charity Link Community\nDevelopment (LCD) \u2013 it does work in\nAfrican countries to improve standards of education \u2013 has hosted the\nMorocco Hitch every year since its\ncreation in 1992. Apparently, hitchhiking almost penniless across the continent to the African country closest to\nthe UK would be an effective fundraising mechanism: at least a thousand of\nus did buy that concept, raising over\n\u00a3300,000 in the process.\nIt all started when a certain Miles\nGlanfield brought news of this event to\nthe conversations of Selkirk Hall\u2019s 3rd\nfloor kitchen. \u201cChallenge yourself to it\u201d\nwas my first reaction. Granted, this is\nno London Marathon, or anything remotely as physically demanding. But,\nas we found out soon enough, it is actually our mentality that is put to the\ntest.\n\u201cWhenever\nour fortunes\ntook a detour\nit did send us\ncrying for antidepressants\u201d\nWe had previously found ourselves\nwaking to rainwater seeping through\nour tent; three hours of thumbing later\nour chances of getting a ride was slimmer than that of us dying of pneumonia on the spot. We were drenched to\nthe bone. The invitation to travel by\npublic bus was too hard to resist. But,\nstaying true to our personal challenge,\nour endurance put up a good fight and\nwon over the temptation.\nAlmost two hours had passed since\nsunrise. Still nothing. A little earlier I\nhad run into trouble with the police:\nfor treating the police like a taxi serv-ice. I was reminded just how spoilt a\npair of hitchers we were to begin with\n\u2013 our longest wait on the first two days\nlasted no more than half an hour.\nI can\u2019t recall doing anything involving that much unpredictability in my\nlife (albeit a mostly uneventful life). We\ncould enjoy a glorious moment as we\nbreeze through hundreds of miles, but\nwhenever our fortunes took a detour\nit did send us crying for anti-depres-sants. But it is not without its positive\noutcome \u2013 it served as a reminder to\nus to treasure every of those \u2018glorious\nmoments\u2019 with awe and appreciation.\nIt has even more to do with human\ninteraction. When one gets an insight\nof the lives of one\u2019s Samaritans, it sets\nthis personal enlightenment from that\nexperienced by travelling on public\ntransport. For once, I felt privileged to\nbe part of a stranger\u2019s voyage, share our\nvarying objectives and destinations yet\nostensiblyheadingtowardsthesamedi-rection. In an increasingly frigid world,\nimmersing into the everyday lives of\nChris the Portuguese marine-turned\ntrucker, Barrie the Anglo-French cook,\nMartine the geography teacher, Julien\n& Laure the nomadic hippies and Romain the crane driver was no everyday\noccurrence.\n(Special mention to the French\nbusinessman who scared us shitless\nby graphically depicting what would\nhappen if the Toulouse nuclear power\nplant explodes \u2013 even I, with my minimum knowledge on the French lan-guage, understood what he was saying.\nWe bore with his banter as he took us\n20k across the outskirts of Toulouse.)\nSpeaking of frigid, I had now begun\nshivering in Lleida. My patience was\nwavering. Then my eardrums shook\n\u2013 it was to the awakened grinding of\na lorry engine. In a seemingly vain at-tempt, deterred by my many failures\non a similar effort, I raised my \u2018Madrid\u2019 sign so that the conductor de\ncami\u00f3n could see. His gesture in re-sponse, I swore down, must have been\na hallucination.\nSo I approached him.\n\u201c\u00bfVa usted a Mardid?\u201d \u201cSi.\u201d (\u201cAre you\ngoing to Madrid?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d)\n\u201c\u00bfDe verdad?\u201d \u201cDe verdad, t\u00edo. Puedo\ntomarte a Mardid.\u201d (\u201cReally?\u201d \u201cReally,\nbruv. I can take you to Madrid.\u201d)\nUpon hearing the news, Anna displayed her talents as a dancer by sprinting and leaping into me in a celebratory\nhug \u2013 the exhilaration beats watching a\nsimilar scene from Dirty Dancing.\nThat exhilaration is what found\nthroughout the trip: it gives proof that,\nthe bitterer a situation gets, the tastier the sweetness when it bears fruit.\nWetness, coldness, sleeplessness, we\nendured them all \u2013 the belief that our\nfrustration would soon end, and tables\nwould turn, kept us going. Just like the\nmonstrous queue to a rollercoaster\nride, it was all part of the suspense.\nOur driver, who introduced himself\nas Amadou, kept to his word: with his\ntwo new companions he now roamed\nthe autopistas that led us inching towards Madrid. Only one small problem\nthough: of Malawian ancestry, he spoke\nextremely little English. The same situation would have baffled many hitch-ers who, some of them had confessed\nto us, relied entirely on English to get\nthem through the continent.\nFortunate for us, Amadou was fluent\nin both Spanish and French; unfortunate for me, Anna had fallen asleep at\nthe back, leaving me to fend for myself with my patchy GCSE-standard\nSpanish.\n\u201cJust like the\nmonstrous\nqueue to a\nrollercoaster\nride, it was\nall part of the\nsuspense\u201d\nNot saying I dreaded exposing my\nunfamiliarity with the language: they\nlove it when they see you try, don\u2019t\nthey? Quite so. My enthusiasm to\ngenerate conversation with Diego, the\nwindow salesman who took us across\nthe tunnels from Vielha to Lleida, kept\nmy phrasebook glued to my hand. Until\nthe awkwardness \u2013 and the dark \u2013 got\nthe best of me, and I stayed quiet for\nthe remainder of the ride. I managed to\ndescribe this unease to Amadou, who\nseemed to have sensed the novice in\nme anyway without saying.\nOne hour of endless conversing\nlater, he remarked that I hadn\u2019t once\nused my phrasebook \u2013 he was flattering me. But then, as \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019\nfound consciousness and tuned in with\na now French-speaking Amadou, my\nhead was able to interpret bits of the\ndialogues from a language I knew little\nof; similarly, after we had parted ways\nwith the trucker, Anna expressed her\namazement on her ability to uphold a\ndiscussion on politics and life using her\nmeagre post- A Level French.\nI then remembered what Diego had\nmentioned a day earlier. \u201cA practicar/\naprender (una idioma), viajar\u201d \u2013 in order to practise/learn a language, travel.\nToo true.\nWestoppedatapetrolstationenroute\nto refuel. As we clambered back into\nthe truck I looked through the wind-screen. My heart almost stopped at the\nsight \u2013 a vehicle bearing the insignia of\nthe Guardia Civil (Spanish paramilitary police) had pulled into the station.\nI certainly didn\u2019t forget that carrying\nmore than one passenger in a lorry\nisn\u2019t exactly legal in Spain. As I feared,\nwe came under their scrutiny. Unwittingly I had left my cardboard perching\nbehind the windscreen, though upside\ndown; a civil guard squinted to read\nthe sign (\u201ccharity hitch\u201d) while Amadou convinced the other that Anna\nand I were his friends rather than mere\npassengers (not entirely untrue).\nEventually we had once again evaded\narrest. Maybe I should stop forgetting\nthat the continental folks tend to be\nmore lenient on crimes petty as illegal\nhitchhiking on a French motorway, or\npitching tent on private land, or kip-ping tramp-style in a car park without\nshelter?\nA lot of people believed that hitchhiking was all about getting from point\nA to point B with zero expenses, save\nthe energy and effort of raising your\nthumb long enough to get yourself\npicked up \u2013 I had been one of them. I\nwas especially ruthless with the plan-ning: my emphasis had been on my\ndestination, Morocco, rather than the\nprocess of getting there. As much as I\nhate to admit it, I was wrong.\nShould I have kept up with that attitude I would have missed so much\ndetail in the fabric. In my urgency to\nreach Morocco I have made decisions\nthat could have potentially hastened\nor slowed down our progress. For in-stance, my stubbornness prevented\nus from travelling towards Bordeaux\nfrom P\u00e9rigueux (just west of Brive), a\nroute that would have saved us days of\nmisery and pointless wander; that said,\nboth Anna and I had agreed with hind-sight, it would mean sacrificing the\nmemories of moments and encounters\nwe now share and cherish.\nTwo pieces of memory we would never trade in for a faster track occurred\nsoon after Amadou had dropped us off\nin the suburbs of Madrid and led us\nto the train station (fine, we cheated\na little bit). As we waded through the\nstreets, I couldn\u2019t help but feel the sentiment of the tri-colours (Anna being\nwhite, me being yellow and Amadou\nblack) striding across a country renowned for its racism \u2013 this metaphor\nreflected the tolerance and kindness\nwe enjoyed. For once, my cynicism\ncrumbled in defeat.\nThe other occasion took place in\nValdemoro, a vibrant town south of\nMadrid. We had arrived at the Repsol\nin search for a hitch down to Algeciras\nferry port, preferably from any of the\nmany lorries lodged by the petrol sta-tion. Perhaps we didn\u2019t have any preferences at all, since we were in no position to bargain when the entire Spain\nhad plunged into an Easter traffic\nlockdown.\nSoon enough, after spending overnight at the station waiting and resting\n(hardly), the futility became clear. We\ndevised a plan: we would stay in Valdemoro for a day before making another\nattempt to hitchhike. Julian, who ran a\nnight shift behind the tapas bar, offered\nus a ride into Valdemoro town. Unbeknownst to us, the hotels declined any\ncheck-ins before 12pm; and so for four\nhours, we took pleasure in Julian\u2019s hospitality at his flat.\n\u201cI believed that\nhitchhiking was\nall about getting\nfrom point A to\npoint B with zero\nexpenses\u2026I was\nwrong\u201d\nCame noon, and Julian\u2019s Romanian\nhousemateLorenaemergedfromslum-ber and aided our search for cheap accommodation (Julian was still asleep).\nThe pair took it upon themselves to\njudge that we were too famished to\ncontinue our hitch \u2013 we devoured at\ntheir expense (including Anna\u2019s very\nfirst chocolate con churros). When I attempted to pay, Lorena grimaced and\ntapped her cheek.\n\u201cThis (gesture) means you\u2019re hurting\nmy feelings,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou\u2019re my\nguests \u2013 allow us to look after you.\u201d\n*\nTheGatwickExpresswasinfullswing\nwith a pledge to deliver us to Victoria\nStation within 30 minutes. My shoulders felt uneasy without the weight of\nmy rucksack; but I was relieved. Anna\nwas busy texting her boyfriend, with\nnews of her arrival from Morocco and\nflirtatiously stressed how much she\nmissed him. A sign bearing \u2018Clapham\nJunction\u2019 sped by \u2013 I was reminded\nhow Chris the Portuguese trucker had\nclogged up the entire cross-junction by\nstopping to pick us up, and grinned.\nNow things have finally come to a full\ncircle. I found myself asking whether I\nwould dare to go hitchhiking again.\nQuizas \u2013 perhaps.\nThis article is dedicated to Chris,\nBarrie, Martine, Romain, Julien &\nLaure, Diego, Amadou, Julian & Lorena, as well as any unnamed individuals who had offered us a hand along\nour hitch to Morocco. Also to Miles,\nto whom I am grateful for introducing\nme to this event of a lifetime.\nInterested?

He has now organised the Zero\nEmissions Race which will see 6 electric vehicles racing 40,000km around\nthe world, across 6 continents, all in 80\ndays!\nHis electric car for this race is being\nbuilt by Imperial College students. The\nteam have called themselves Racing\nGreen Endurance (RGE), and will be\nthe only student led team in the whole\nevent.\nThe project started as an autono-W\nhat if cars could\nrun on wind power\nalone? Britain is at\nthe cutting edge of\nwind-powered car\ntechnology. British Greenbird has just\nset the land speed record (202.9km/\nhr) for a wind vehicle on 26th March,\nwhilst Ecotricity, a British energy com-pany, is sponsoring the revamp of the\nLotus Exige sportscar into an all electric vehicle powered by wind-generat-ed electricity.\nBut this is no recent development.\nBack in the 1970s, when the last fuel\ncrisis hit western economies, the\nWindmobile (\u201cland sailer for the higway\u201d) featured on the cover of the 1976\nissue of Popular Science magazine.\nThis amazing vehicle could be powered by wind on the highways alone, or\ncould use wind to extend the range of\nits electric motor. Like the Greenbird,\nWindmobile could run on wind already\navailable in the atmosphere alone. For\nmost cars though, especially within\nthe city, the wind is not fast enough to\npower them. Windmobile could use its\nsmart design to aid its movements and\nso extend range; the Popular Science\narticle reported. The designer\u2019s view\nwas that placing a similar sail on personal vehicles could extend their range\nup to 40% as well. The plans were in\nmotion for a four-seat family Windmobile, but the economic forces precluded\nthis green technology and as soon the\noil prices were down again, the Windmobile was buried in history.\nSeveral other patents have been filed\nsince the 1970s for using wind energy\nfor fuelling cars. Many of these are\nbased on the simple observation that\nat high car speeds, the incoming wind\nspeed is also quick and could generate electricity. Now the skeptics could\nsay that most of this incoming wind\nis generated by the car\u2019s movement\nin the first place, which is true (un-less you live and drive in windy areas\nused by the Green Bird), but the fact\nthat this wind energy is going to waste\nstill stands. So, many patents are based\non internal wind turbines that capture\nmuch of the incoming wind which use\nit to generate electricity and so extends\nthe car\u2019s range. This works in much the\nsame way as re-generative braking; it\nis the recycling of waste energy rather\nthan creation of energy anew. (Another\nway around the fact that a lot of energy\nis expended by cars just to push the air\naround themselves, and so is lost on\ndrag, is to design cars so to minimize\nthe drag \u2013 this is the idea behind Aptera electric car now on sale in California. With its light and streamlined\nbody Aptera is very reminiscent of the\nWindmobile.)\nWind cars: future of motoring?\nThe newest development in this area\nis RoarMaxx\u2019s Formula AE sportscar\ndesigned by two enthusiastic highschool students who decided to design\na car that would recapture some of the\nwind energy.\nThe \u201cenergy lost under the friction of\nthe air will be recovered through aerodynamically optimised intakes, which\nforce air into the turbines like fans that\nwill spin brushless synchronous alternators recovering a predicted 20-25%\nelectrical energy which will then get\nstored in Ultra-Capacitors for immediate usage. Four strategically placed air\nflow recovery systems will be installed\naround the vehicle, but their intakes\nwill not be obvious because the body\nwork design will incorporate them in a\nway that\u2019s very pleasing to the human\neye; an important key factor in vehicle\ndesign.\u201d\nLike the later version of Windmobile,\nthis car will also incorporate roof-top\nsolar panels to extend the range a further 15-40%. The combination of such\n\u2018airflow re-capture energy\u2019 and a sail\nthat would generate energy from the\ntrue wind (the one not caused by the\nvehicle\u2019s movement), might one day\nlead to an all wind-powered electric\nMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107 investigates the past, present and future of wind-powered cars.\nImperial College\u2019s Racing Green Endurance team with their new toy, a sportscar they are turning into an\nelectric car for the December\u2019s Zero Emissions race around the world.\nAndrew Hadland\nScience Correspondent\nWind powered Lotus Exige.\nWindmobile was tested by Popular Science\u2019s writer in 1976.

The vehicle used its electric motor to get up to the speed of 30mph and then\non windy highway the wind-only propulsion\ncarried on. With crosswinds of above 9mph\nthe Windmobile runs on wind and can reach\n62mph. Popular Science described it as being\nlike \u201csome kind of space capsule out of a Walt\nDisney movie\u201d.

The technology is probably already\nall there, buried in unused patents, but\nthere are no economic incentives to\ndevelop it.\nA more realistic way of using wind to\npower cars is to harvest wind for the\ngrid, and then charge your electric car\nfrom that grid. In this way you use clean\nwind-power to power your electric car.\nThis is exactly what the new development by Ecotricity is trying to do. The\nproject of turning a Lotus Exige into an\nelectric sports car is reminiscent of the\nTesla Roadster, an electric sportscar\nfrom California.

Dental evidence showed that a specimen\npreviously thought to be an Eoraptor\nwas a previously unclassified genus of\nthe Ornithischian order.\nRadiometric dating techniques recently developed at the University of\nBristol showed that the species lived\nwell into the Holocene, outlasting all\nother species by 65 million years. It\nis not clear why the species survived\nthe Cretaceous Tertiary mass extinction that is thought to have caused the\nextinction of all dinosaurs. Some estimates obtained from IridiumII/IridiumIII ratios place that date as little as\n2.5Kya, or about 500 years BC.\nNotable on the specimen are tool\nmarks on the bones. Researchers originally thought that the long scratches\nwere made by tools during excavation,\nbut closer analysis revealed that the\nscratches were coated with a layer of\nsilica, like the rest of the bones. Electron micrographs of the scratches reveal that they are very well defined,\nand do not resemble the more irregular scratches often found on dinosaur\nbones from the teeth and claws of\npredators of scavengers. A fragment\nof iron oxide was also found within the\npelvis. According to Dr. Martin Bunt of\nthe Natural History Museum the iron\nmust have been introduced to the skeleton prior to burial.\nPalaeontologists have struggled to\nexplain apparent scorch marks on the\nteeth of the dinosaur. Professor Mark\nAllison of Imperial College London\npostulated that strong calcification of\nteeth can only be explained by exposure of the growing teeth to prolonged\nand intense heat. \u201cThe only possible\nsource of the heat, as I see it, is inter-nal, it almost seems as if the pyromani-cus breathed fire\u201d.\nResearchers are struggling to find the\ncause of death of D. pyromanicus. The\nbones show none of the telltale signs of\nNew dinosaur discovered\non the Isle of Wight\nChad Huleatt\nPalaeontologist\naging, such as poorly healed fractures\nof tumours that are often found associated with dinosaurs that died of old\nage. The tool marks and iron found on\nthe bones has led Dr. Peter Sutton, of\nImperial College London to suggest a\nhuman cause of death. Allison points\nout that the dinosaur lived well into the\niron age, when the Isle of Wight was\nknown to have been populated by people possessing the relevant knowledge\nfor the production of iron weapons.\nAccording to Allison, D. pyromanicus\nmay be the first example of an extinction caused directly by man.\nPhysics students nominated\nfor Nobel Prize this year\nStudents from the Department of\nPhysics at Imperial College have been\nworking on a project in an attempt to\nidentify the problem with the latest\nclass of Photon Torpedo\u2019s. The study\nis part of their third year group project\nand has led to their work being short\nlisted for the Nobel Physics Prize this\nyear.\nThe students from the Physics department have discovered that a phenomena known as \u201cLong Anti Matter\nExposure\u201d has been causing problems\nwith the detonation device in the tor-pedo, hence making it difficult for any\ndestruction. In order to study the effect in more detail, they have built their\nown torpedo and have been closely\nmonitoring the \u201cLong Anti Matter Exposure\u201d factor.\nOver the past six months they have\nhad the torpedo locked safely in the\nbasements of Blackett next to the small\nparticle collider under heavy guard,\ndue to fears that members of the secret\norganisation, \u2018Junior Officers of the\nHudya Nikabolokov\nForeign Correspondent\nKlingon Empire\u2019 wanting to steal it.\nProblems, however, arose when the\ncollider was in use which led to an interaction between the anti-matter in\nthe torpedo and the collider. The outcome was the creation of a small worm\nhole in the basement which has led\nto several long haired, black-clothed,\ngreasy creatures appearing in the Physics Department.\nA spokesman from the Physics department told felix that \u201cWe believe\nthat the incident that occurred in the\nbasements of Blackett was an act of\nsabotage, our biggest fear is that it is a\n\u2018Junior Officers of the Klingon Empire\u2019\nattack.\u201d\nNevertheless, the resulting creation\nof the worm hole, whether it was intentional or not, has led to the students\nbeing nominated for the prestigious\naward. The results are to be announced\nin Stockholm later this year in front of\nthe King and Queen of Sweden.\nMembers of the covert JOKE squad just before the raid\nThe real thing may not have been this epic\nScientists from around the world converged to the Great Hall in early March\nto take part in the Ig Nobel 2009\nRoadshow.\nThe Ig Nobel Prize is an annual\naward given out every October, the\nsame time as the Nobel Prizes, to research that makes people think about\nthe sciences. Commenting on the 2006\nawards, Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research, cosponsor of the awards, said: \u201cThe prizes\nare intended to celebrate the unusual,\nhonour the imaginative - and spur\npeople\u2019s interest in science, medicine\nand technology.\u201d\nPrevious winners of the award include Pierce Barnes, a research associate in chemistry at Imperial College,\nwho in 2006 calculated the number of\nphotographs you must take to (almost)\nUnion bars to sell students\nPurely Indiscriminate\nSparkling Substance\n\u0425\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043c\u0430\u043d\nEastern Blocker\nensure that nobody in a group photo\nwill have their eyes closed. Other highlights include Fiona Barclay who created the Periodic Table table.\nA rather surprising entry into this\nyears award came from Imperial College Union who entered a paper on\nlager. The study investigated under\nhow many different brands they could\nmarket the same lager under in the\nUnion Bars before arousing any sort of\nsuspicion. It was found that they could\nmarket up to eight different brands, including one brand of wheat beer and\none non-alcoholic brand. The beer that\neveryone has in fact been drinking is a\nspecial brand from Kentucky\u2019s finest\nbrewery, however the Union refuses to\nrelease the name of the brewer.\nOther highlights for 2009 include\nproof that dog fleas jump higher than\ncat fleas and that our perception of\ncrisp-crunchiness is influenced by\nsound-effects.\nA strong contender for the secret Union beer\nY\nou are doomed.

The last time that\nfelix had the honour of Hangman\u2019s\npresence was in the Winter term and\nwe caused quite a shit storm.

The Imperial College Immortals (ICIs) chalked up their\nfirst game of the season on Sunday. A\nfair crowd turned up to support ICIs\nbattle against one of the UK\u2019s top senior teams, The London Cobras.\nIt was clear from the start who the\npros were when on the first play ICI\nbarely returned the kick-off for more\nthan 10 yards before their wedge\nbusters destroyed our feeble first\nwedge consisting of Quincy (No. 52),\nMac (55), Jan (58) and Arthur (77) and\ntotally flattened Big Geoff (88). The offence which was lead by Kennedy (9)\nwere unsuccessful on their first drive\nand were forced to punt on the 4th\ndown, which was returned for the first\ntouchdown for the Cobras.\nICI were clearly rattled with no one\nreally ready for the brutal physical\nchallenge ahead. It was not until the\nsecond quarter that they started to get\ntheir act together. The defence lead by\nGoose (42) started to bond. Big open\nfield tackles came in from the two\nstandout defensive backs Fisher (20)\nand Ramirez (25) with Quincy doing it\nfor the D Line gave the defence some\nconfidence.\nThe offence was able to feed off this\nsuccess and with one of the last play\nof the first half, the O-Line of Sanches\n(78), Sikorski (68), Tovell (63), Mac and\nQuincy held strong and Kennedy was\nable to dodge a tackle and make our\nfirst ever 1st down, which considering the quality of the opposition was a\nhuge achievement.\nThe second half began and the wedge\nseemed to have a new lease of life,\nholding form to allow a longer return.\nBoth the offence and defence worked\ntirelessly for the whole game with the\nhome team picking up two more first\ndowns from Newton (16) and Tino\n(81).\nIt is true that ICI were outclassed on\nthe day but each and every player gave\nit their all and the experience gained\nfrom coming face to face with a team\nwho only conceded 9 points in their 10\ngame regular season is priceless. The\nImmortals are now league material. So\nnext year they look forward to games\nagainst other universities and hopefully making it to the play-offs.\nSadly we are saying farewell to a couple of members of the team. Thank you\nvery much for all the hard work put\nin over the year from Stan, Ramirez,\nBinnie and Sanches. These places will\nneed filling up next year so bulk up and\nget in touch!\nGeorge Barnes\nImperial fencing finishes\noff a brilliant season with a\nresounding win\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird. Last year, we had finished\nall our matches before the Christmas\nbreak...\u201d Our president, Chris Namih,\nuttered those words before we set\noff to Southampton at the beginning\nof this term for our last (postponed)\nleague match.\nWinning it made us undefeated\nsouth-east conference champions. It\nalso meant that the season was still on\nfor a while yet... Two months on, we\nhad narrowly lost a BUCS championship quarter-final to Northumbria, and\nfenced our way into a playoff match for\npromotion into the highest league division in the country, the Premiership.\nWinning this meant fencing against\nthe likes of Oxford and Cambridge (the\ntop two teams in Britain) next year, and\nwould give us the chance to start a rivalry with UCL (it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t\nlike them, or think we\u2019re the better\nLondon uni, but I\u2019m just saying...)\nOur opponents were Bath, last-placed in this year\u2019s premiership with\na none-too-flattering record: just one\nwin out of six matches played, and\none walkover conceded. The team\nthat turned up only consisted of three\nfencers! As we warmed up, many of\nus couldn\u2019t help feeling that the premiership was within our reach. Some\nclub novices and friends, as well as the\nBUCS silver medallist women\u2019s team,\nhad turned up to cheer us on; they got\nthe win they were hoping for as Imperial dominated the match from start to\nfinish. The sabre wasn\u2019t much of a contest as Jean-Romain, Naren, Wookie\nand Maiyuran made it 45-16; the foil\neven less so with Chris G, Namih, Little Ed and Indy getting a score of 45-8.\nBig Ed, Ale and Marcello rounded off\nthe match with a comfortable 45-13\nwin in the epee. That was it, Premiership. Sorted!\nDespite a slight anticlimactic feeling,\nafter what was our largest win of the\nyear, we were still pretty chuffed at the\nseason we\u2019d had. The win was the cue\nfor a whole evening of fun, as we went\non to shave the president\u2019s hair off at\nthe union (and, in a related incident,\nAndreas\u2019s, Wookie\u2019s, Maiyuran\u2019s and\nSjoerd\u2019s) and then went out for a 30-strong dinner and a bit of partying! I\nthink everyone in the club, from the\nnovices to our adored president, deserves a special mention for making\nthis year such a great one for fencing\nat Imperial. Cheers guys, and see you\nnext year in the Premiership!\nFencing\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 135\nBath Men\u2019s 1st 37\nIndy Leclercq\nAt least we still have the Gutteridge Reserves Cup\nIn the twilight of what had been a successful season for the Imperial 2nd XV,\nthe players were determined to seal a\ntrophy, especially off the back of a huge\nand comprehensive 69 \u2013 0 victory of\nMiddlesex in their midweek league\nmatch. Despite having not played a\ngame in the Reserve Cup so far, IC\nknew they were in for a stern test from\nwhat would be a dogged, albeit less tal-ented, UCL 2nd team. Moreover, the\n2s were now Imperial\u2019s flagship rugby\nteam in all ULU competitions, given\nthe shock exit of the 1st XV a fortnight\nago.\nIn the pre-match huddle, Coach\nBrimah\u2019s instruction was to bring out\nthe running game from the word go.\nStraight off the UCL kick-off the 2s ran\ntheir now famous Brunel ball; a strong\ncrash up the middle from Adam Foley\nbeing followed by a burst up the blind\nside from Rob Dowden and China Lite.\nImperial recycled well and soon earned\na penalty inside the UCL 22, which,\nwithout any hesitation, was kicked for\ngoal to put Imperial 3 \u2013 0 to the good.\nDespite this electrifying start, Imperial then stuttered. A workmanlike attitude from the UCL forwards coupled\nwith some poor decisions with ball\nin hand led to UCL having consistently good field position. Fortunately,\nthe UCL kicker did not have the same\ncomposure as his counterpart, and\nfailed to capitalise on a penalty that\nwas imminently kickable. Imperial\nthen began to claw their way back to\ntheir early match form. Despite conceded the majority of the possession\nto their opposition, UCL never threat-ened, and soon the Imperial back three\nshowed their class with some searing\nbreaks from deep. On one occasion\nfullback and man-of-the-match Dowden made 50m in one break that markedly resembled a knife cutting through\nsoft butter. Unfortunately, the supporting players failed to show the required\nslight-of-hand required to score the try\nthat was deserved.\nNo matter; Imperial were now rejuvenated and had the ball deep in the\nopposition territory. A short chip from\nfly half Scott Greening, which was\nwell pressurised by Foley, forced UCL\ninto conceding a lineout on their own\n5m line. Following on from previous\ngames, the Imperial forwards showed\nutter domination in the lineout, with\nthe catch and drive resulting in Imperial\u2019s first try of the game; the ball\nhaving been put down finally by Ben\nMoorhouse.\nThe wide conversion shanked; the\nRugby\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 20\nUCL Men\u2019s 2nd 3\nScott Greening\nscore was 8 \u2013 0. Imperial should have\ncarried this lead into the halftime in-terval, however indiscipline gave away\na penalty that even UCL couldn\u2019t\nmiss, allowing them to score their first\npoints, leaving 8 \u2013 3 as the halftime\nscore.\nThe second half began in a similar\nvein to the first half, Imperial failed to\nexert their authority in the opening 10\nminutes of the half, allowing UCL too\nmuch ball and then kicking away the\npossession they had. It was a moment\nof vision and opportunism that led\nto Imperial\u2019s second try. From a penalty in Imperial\u2019s half, rather than kick\nfor touch, Greening noticed the UCL\nteam idling, clearly trying to recover\ntheir breath. Greening took a quick tap\nand chipped over the static UCL line.\nDespite the covering winger and fullback the bounce of the ball was good\nand was caught by the chasing fly half.\nDespite bouncing off the attempted\ndouble tackle, Greening responding\nto calls from David Bowe and span the\nball out to Lite to touch down in the\ncorner. The wide conversion was again\nfailed, leaving the score at 13 \u2013 3.\nFrom this point out Imperial oozed\nclass and exerted their marked supe-riority. The whole team ran its pattern just as they had trained, with the\nforwards securing quick ball, and the\nbacks running with pace and from\ndeep. Lite made continuous breaks\ndown the right flank, repeatedly out-pacing his opposite man, despite being \u201cshown\u201d the inside. Powerful runs\nfrom Imperials big boys, most notably\nConan O\u2019Rourke, made deep inroads\ninto the UCL defense. After 10 phases\nof superb organisation and distribution\nfrom scrum half Penfold, Imperial span\nthe ball wide through the hands, allowing Bowe to run through a gap so big\nhe could have moon-walked through.\nThis time the touchline conversion\nwas successful, bringing the score to\nit\u2019s ultimately finality, 20 \u2013 3.\nImperial continued this pattern to\nthe death, running continuous phases\nand looking dangerous. Unfortunately,\nno more points could be added. It was\nno matter, UCL knew they had been\nbeaten by a class act in the second\nhalf.\nThe Reserve Cup was therefore retained for another year by Imperial.\nThis trophy was no less than the team,\nled expertly by Captain Andy Macfadge, deserved after a hard and ultimately rewarding season.\nDismal end to an abysmal\nseason for both rugby 1sts\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nThe end of the season couldn\u2019t have\ncome any sooner for Imperial College\nRFU and Imperial Medicals RFU 1st\nteams. Both sides have had a difficult\nseason in the BUCS Southern Premiership B, fighting for survival and pride.\nDespite their best effort, including a\nnail-bitting Varsity that saw the match\ngo into extra time yet again, neither\nteam managed to make a very successful season of it in the league. Both teams\nwere, however, hoping for better success in the ULU cups, something which\nboth clubs have managed to have a\nfirm grip over the past few years. Imperial\u2019s 1sts managed to get a bye straight\ninto the quarter-final of the Gutteridge\nCup, a competition which they have\ndominated over the years and planned\nto do the same this year.\nCollege managed to get a walkover\nover SOAS who were unable to field\na team, which left on King\u2019s College\nin the way of them and another Gutteridge Cup final. Having beaten King\u2019s\nmany a time before in the competition,\nthe side was ready for the match, how-ever, it seems that the King\u2019s side wanted to get to the final more than Imperial did. The end result, King\u2019s beating\nImperial and eventually beating Royal\nHolloway.\nThis was not the only success for\nKing\u2019s College, as their own medical school, GKT, were yet again in the\nUnited Hospitals Cup against Imperial\nMedicals. The UH Cup is oldest rugby\ncup competition, predating the Calcutta Cup by four years, and the Medicals have been the holders of the prestigious cup for the last seven years. It\nseemed, however, that lady luck wasn\u2019t\non their side either as their 1sts, 2nds\nand 3rds all managed to lose to GKT\nin the final.\nHopefully the new season will bring\nbetter fortune for both sides as they try\nto retain the former glory they once\nhad.\nImperial\u2019s 2nd XV with the mighty Gutteridge Reserves Cup\nIC 1st XV looking dejected after this year\u2019s closely fought Varsity\nThe Imperial fencers avoiding a lunge attack from the Bath fencer\nThe newly formed Imperial Immortals, Imperial\u2019s very own American Football team\nphoto by Joe Muddiman\n\n"

For\nsome, it is the final leg of their university life whilst for others it is only the\nbeginning. Either way, the end result is\nthe same; pure relief that it is finally all\nover.\nAs I now personally reach the end of\nmy fifth year at Imperial and look forward to employment, I couldn\u2019t help\nbut look back at the major aspects of\nmy university life. As I see it, there are\neffectively five aspects, or pillars, to any\nstudents life at university and if any of\nthese pillars fall, you time will be a long\nand arduous one. Education, Clubs and\nSocieties, Finance & Services, Housing\nand Entertainments. Some of these\nare clearly interlinked and dependent\nupon others, but the point stands, if\none of the categories has a problem,\nyou will notice it.\nSeeing as the first story of this year is\nabout entertainment, let\u2019s go with that\none. After a hard days work in the lecture theatres and labs, or even after a\nhard fought sports fixture or concert,\nthe students need a place where they\ncan go, relax and have a good time.\nThe most obvious choice for this is the\nStudents\u2019 Union, but the problem is, as\nmany students have pointed out time\nand time again, it\u2019s rubbish!\nTo me, it seems that the Union has\nhad a communication problem with its\nstudents. I\u2019m sure that numerous attempts have been made and I am sure\nthat students have given their input,\nbut is it just me or do they not seem\nto listen? Freshers\u2019 Week and the Summer Ball will always be busy, no matter\nwhat university you go to in the coun-try, yet even though they know it is going to be busy, they still manage to get\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nThe pillars of\nuniversity life.\nChapter One\nAnnabel Slater has a bone to pick with The Rogue\nI\nmperial full of plain Janes with\ndelusional perceptions of self-worth, shallow brains. So says\nthe Rogue, quickly assuring us\nthat he is not some careless student hack in the Comments section,\nspouting a sexual frustration induced\nharangue that insults almost everyone here at Imperial. No, he has a wise\ncommentary to deliver, based on carefully observed field evidence which\none can and has witnessed every day.\nApparently, Imperial\u2019s womenfolk\nneed taking down a peg. Especially,\nhe stresses, the main breed- the plain\ngirls (again, the Rogue can help you out\nhere- they\u2019re the ones who aren\u2019t \u201cfollically challenged\u201d by which we can only\npresume means bald or bushy haired,\nor have kind of symmetrical faces,\nor don\u2019t have the body of a fat child).\nThey\u2019re too proud. Nauseating. Supercilious. Full of undeserved confidence.\nThe Rogue reports how if, as a humble student, you catch the eye of a passing female student, the stranger will do\none of two things. This is very impor-tant, so it was printed in bold type.\nthings wrong. The acts don\u2019t reflect the\ngeneral population of Imperial, when\nthey do try, the tickets are considered\nto be expensive.\nI\u2019ll be the first to give credit when\nthey deserve it, and for what they did\nat the Easter \u201cCredit Crunch\u201d Carnival, they definitely deserve it. There\nwere no big name Radio 1 DJ\u2019s costing\nthousands of pounds, there weren\u2019t\nextravagant decorations and they offered something for everyone, all for a\nlow price. The result, a packed Union,\nwhich would have happened anyway,\nfull of people having a good time, enjoying the music and the company of\npeople they were with. The result for\nthe Union, a healthy profit margin.\nWhy has this taken so long for them to\nfigure out and why was it so difficult?\nI know for a fact on the Tuesday of\nFreshers\u2019 Week, the Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) Lily Topham,\nwanted to have a showcase of the different arts societies of the Union. The\nresult there was a very full Union with\npeople having a fun time and again the\nUnion making more profit; more profit\nthan Tuesdays from previous Frehsers\u2019\nWeek. Yet she was met with several\nobstacles from the Union who didn\u2019t\nthink the quality of the acts would be\ngood enough! How wrong they were!\nThe initial outlook for the Summer\nBall looks promising, yet again it seems\nthat they are taking on board what students have wanted for some time. Variety! They have several live bands, actual live bands, not like last year where\nthey advertised that The Klaxons were\nplaying, only for students to later realise that it was a DJ Set. What was the\npoint of paying so much money for\none member of a band to play a DJ Set,\nwhat was accomplished?\nOverspending the entertainments\nbudget for the Ball by around \u00a312,000\nand making a total loss of around\n\u00a38,000 for the whole ball, that\u2019s what.\nAn even more interesting question\nis how have they managed to stick to\ntheir budget this year, which was similar to last year\u2019s, and somehow get a\nbetter, wider range of acts for the Summer Ball?\nThe credibility and popularity of\nany venue is mainly based on word of\nmouth, and having people tell you that\nthe Union is a rubbish venue to go to as\nsoon as you arrive won\u2019t help at all. At\nthe same time they haven\u2019t been seen\nto be doing much about it and have\ncarried on regardless of what students\nsay.\nLet us really hope that this new\nchange in direction is a positive one;\none where they listen to the students\nand give them what they want and not\nsimply do what pleases them, and then\nmaybe, just maybe, we can have a Union where the students will be proud of\ngoing to.\nOne-shewillwalkpastwithoutnoticing (Oh! She did NOT\u2026 what a stuck-up bovine!), OR, two- she will glance at\nyou, hold your gaze for a little too long\n(probably pretending to wonder if she\nknows you, ha!) before embarrassedly\nglancing away, \u201cself-disapproving and\nannoyed that she isn\u2019t more of a bitch\u201d.\nYou know, I can really sympathise with\nher, what girl *doesn\u2019t* wish just that,\nwhen she makes eye contact with a\nstranger? Like, duh! The horror! The\nsheer nerve! A deplorable sense of\nself-importance, indeed, when a girl\nyou don\u2019t know either walks past you\nor LOOKS AT YOU and then WALKS\nPAST YOU. What kind of creatures are\nthese?\nHaving pointed out the nauseating\nshortcomings of the average Imperial\nfemale, the Rogue generously tosses\nout a noble concession. Clearly, this\nnet of criticism cannot be laid on every\nImperial girl, he adds halfway through\nhis pontification (I can nearly use big\nwords as well as he can), having previously and suitably established that all\nof Imperial\u2019s womenfolk are egotistical,\nthat supercilious girls with borderline\ntrainwreck bodies are being increasingly witnessed every day at Imperial,\nthat their unattractiveness only makes\ntheir behavior all the more appalling,\nand that girls who were bullied in high\nschool should seriously think about\nwhether they deserve to be confident\nat university or not (they don\u2019t, he reassures us). No, the responsibility for\nthe creation of these deluded creatures\nlies with Imperial\u2019s male student des-peradoes, who first encouraged these\nbloated egos. Why, in a spot of healthy,\nsneering dB\u2019s voyeurism the Rogue\nand his similarly shrewd male friend\nobserved a \u201cmoderately attractive\u201d girl\ndancing with a group of \u201cdisgusting\u201d\nmale students (possibly perverts too,\nin the Rogue\u2019s words), then receiving\nsome \u2018nauseatingly insincere\u2019 attention\nfrom one of them in the hopes of getting an accidental shag. Of course, he\nfailed, because he was one of those lap-dogs that the Rogue is not. Meanwhile,\nthe girl, like the rest of her vile gender,\nsubconsciously \u201ccongratulated herself\non the hollow offer of casual sex\u201d and\nfilled up her ego some more.\nThe Rogue concludes that this fun\nlittle story illustrates his central the-sis- that the way in which men and\nwomen react to each other has degenerated appallingly in Imperial, although by the end of his article, he\u2019s\nsuddenly attacking the superficial male\nas the creator of these Frankenstein\nshe-monsters, as well as the original\nconcept of airheaded, power tripping,\nborderline fugly females. We\u2019re just\ntwo completely different species, aren\u2019t\nwe? How else do you explain the reeking air of superiority that the Rogue\u2019s\nkeen and fair senses detect from Imperial womenfolk? No doubt, articles like\nthe Rogue\u2019s can help us all get along\nwhen we have to. So come on- don\u2019t\nyou realize that Imperial is apparently\na godforsaken establishment where\nalmost all the men are desperate, and\nall the women stuck-up? Being at Imperial, you see, has utterly destroyed\ntheir desire of \u201ca meaningful platonic\nrelationship\u201d. Appallingly, most of\nthem are shallow, undesirable creatures to boot! Take those awful women\ndown a peg. Quick, male students, step\nback and take a good look at yourselves\nto check you\u2019re not becoming a lapdog.\nI\u2019m not sure how- probably, it involves\nnot being nice to girls, especially those\nwho aren\u2019t even pretty enough to deserve it. Girls, we need to take a look\nat ourselves too- apparently we all look\nlike we\u2019ve been made over by mentally\ndefective makeup artists! But what do I\nknow- I mean look, I\u2019m a woman and\nI\u2019m even writing into Felix to comment\non the Rogue\u2019s so intelligently written\npiece. The Rogue\u2019s already laid it all\nout, without having to answer the begging question of whether he actually\nhas any female friends here, or just the\nmoronic caricatures he nurses in his\nhead. I\u2019m just making sure everyone\nunderstands his message, I don\u2019t even\nhave a cool nickname. And just look\nat me. Chances are, I\u2019m just a typical\nImperial girl. One of those typical de-luded, once-bullied girls, validating my\ngargantuan sense of superficial self-worth with the regular attention of\ndesperate males, and by nabbing a bit\nof print-space\u2026\n\u201cLet us really\nhope that this\nnew change of\ndirection is a\npositive one\u201d\n\u201cGirls, we need\nto take a look at\nourselves too-apparently we all\nlook like we\u2019ve\nbeen made over\nby mentally\ndefective\nmakeup artists!\u201d\nphoto by ian gillett\nDylan Lowe finds kindness in a \u2018treacherous\u2019 world\nW\nhenever I turned\nmy attention to\nthe \u2018dangers & annoyances\u2019 section\nof my travel guide,\nI knew I was heading towards a very\nwrong direction.\nHustlers? Faux guides? Pickpockets?\nRobberies at knifepoint? What was I\neven thinking in the first place?\nNot that my past experiences helped:\ntrust me, I have long since lost my innocence to this ruthless world. To this\ndate I still refuse to let a stranger into\nthe one-metre radius of my baggage,\nand find deception in every unrecog-nisable face. Paranoia? No my friend,\nvigilance. And, to a certain extent,\nsnobbery.\nSurely, strangers do not deserve your\nindividual attention, let alone your individual sympathy. Especially when, as\nthey attempt to explain their hardship,\nthe meanings are lost in translation. So\nwhy not despise them? To sum it up in\none, typically-English, phrase \u2012 \u2018bloody\nforeigners\u2019.\nI soon found myself at the mercy of\nthese \u2018foreigners\u2019.\nTo participate in an activity that\nis hitchhiking, one must step into a\nstranger\u2019s vehicle with all of his cynicism and distrust cast aside. The fact\nthat the driver has cared to express interest on some stranger\u2019s welfare is an\nunambiguous indication of kindness.\nSimilarly, they have as much to despise\nagainst foreigners as we do; still they\ndispel cultural differences and commit\ntheir act of charity.\nAnd there should be no scepticism\non this \u2018charity\u2019 \u2012 it doesn\u2019t necessarily include a sinister element. However\nthe movie industry decides to portray\nhitchhiking, Anna and I weren\u2019t escaping convicts, and the drivers who\npicked us up certainly weren\u2019t serial\nkillers. Here is the proof: I have made\nit back in one piece.\nThanks to the media, our society\nseems to be swathed with a swarm of\nsad faces or mourning gowns. When\nthe pages of your newspaper are brimming with negativity, one can\u2019t help but\nre-modify his perspectives of the world\naccording to this pessimists\u2019 model.\nBut then, as human nature dictates, we\nthrive on gloom.\nAfter all, pain is more deeply felt \u2012\nand inflicts more emotions \u2012 than the\nprocess of healing.\nAway from the media coverage and\ncomputer screen, I took it upon myself\nto search for and experience genuine\nkindness first hand. What I found, as\nI tread my path, was the joy of discovering displays of compassion from the\nmost unlikely of places.\nThe formidable appearances of several drivers along our way would have\nrepelled us from accepting the rides.\nChris initially emanated the impression of a Mediterranean miscreant;\nBarrie with his Mohican hairstyle appeared rascal-like with sadism lurking\nbehind his eyes. Both turned out to be\nthe nicest individuals I have ever met.\nRather than taking advantage of our in-nocence, like their fellow countrymen\nwould, the Romanians in Valdemoro\n(Julian & Lorena) had spent a staggering twenty Euros on a pair of complete\nstrangers.\nThere is always a motivation behind\nevery deed of kindness. In hitchhiking\nterms, many of the drivers who picked\nus up craved for the companionship, a\nbreak from long periods of isolation.\nSometimes it was because we possess\nsomething they need, for example a\nbetter map.\nIt may be spiritual rather than materialistic \u2012 sympathy, redemption for\none\u2019s previous wrong-doings, repayment for others\u2019 displays of kindness,\neven the mere satisfaction which\ncomes with being charitable.\nThere is no such thing as absolute\nselflessness; selflessness will always be\ntainted by at least a small smudge of\nselfish mindset. Yet, the simple act of\ngenerosity as motivated by mostly selflessness is, as quantified by our cynical\nsociety, most noble indeed.\n\u201cThere is always\na motivation\nbehind every\ndeed of\nkindness...\nsometimes it\nwas because we\nhad something\nthey needed\u201d\nHitchhiking, I discovered, brings\nthe best out of this generosity. We\nhave been fortunate to have received\nfrom individuals not because they had\nso much to give away, but rather the\ncontrary.\nWhether the manifestation of generosity may be materialistic as money,\nrefreshments, or something as subtle\nas space, privacy, or most certainly\ntheir time, many of which our Samaritans lacked, they were still willing to\ngive to a couple-in-need.\nLorena emphasised how much generosity and hospitality she had encountered and received when she was\nherself travelling. As though in debt,\nshe felt it was her morale duty to repay\nthe kindness by becoming benevolent\nand generous herself. That way, she\nbelieved, was the only way to overcome the \u2018treachery\u2019 that enshrouds\nour lives.\nI hope I have now repaid this kindness by shedding some optimism on\nthis sceptical world.\nAfonso Campos likes clapping and being locked in\nT\nhere\u2019s something quite\nspecial about doing things\nthat the great majority of\npeople never actually get\ndo. It\u2019s not necessarily because they\u2019re exclusive or open only to\nan elite and select group of few who\nhave somehow, magically acquired invitations to these not-even-that-glam-orous happenings.\nFor the most part, these things are\nbest when they are very low-key rather\nthan elaborate spectacles including\ndancing mexican midgets in ill-fitting\ncashmere underwear and stick-thin\ncatwalk models carrying trays filled to\nthe brim with intricate canapes of crap\nyou have never even heard of or could\neven fathom eating, like domesticated\nferret covered in bacon, cut into thin\nslices and dipped into a bath of pink\ngold.\nOne of these things is being backstage at the end of an incredible play.\nThere is an inexplicable and splendid\nbeauty about the theatre that you just\ncan\u2019t find at the movies.\nThe ovation and the actors covertly\nshedding a tear, the scenographers\nsmiling timidly, the directors oozing\na radiant love for their craft, the audience shouting a corageous and mighty\n\u201cbravo\u201d, the lights slightly dimmed,\nthe echo of the endless clapping - the\nfinale of a fantastic play is one of the\nmost amazing experiences one can go\nthrough. It\u2019s borderline impossible to\nstand on the sideline and not feel like\nyou are in one way or another part of\nthis great machine where the boundaries and truth are too indistinct to\nmake out.\nAs you peer through the sides of the\ngreat stage and for a brief moment, one\nof the actors turns back and your eyes\nfatefully cross, it all becomes evident.\nAll the people on stage, all the people\nin the audience, and yourself, you are all\nthere opposing realism and supporting\nart for art\u2019s sake. While experiencing\nthis from backstage is pretty magical\nbecause you are privy to the hard work\nthat goes into making it all happen, it\nis just as satisfactory to experience this\nfrom the audience. If you have never\nhad the fortune to live through a scenario in the likeness of this one, I urge\nyou to seek one soon.\nThere is something else that I have\nfor eons wondered about and only just\nvery recently manage to experience \u2013\nlock-in at a pub. I have always wanted\nto know what it feels like to stay in a\npub past closing time. I\u2019m sure I am not\nalone in this musing and also sure that\nlike myself, you have peered in through\nthe shuttered windows of your local as\nyou stumble back to the bus station in\na sort of drunken stupor.\nInside it you witness a scene that you\nwish you could be a part of.\nYou see people holding lit cigarettes\nindoors, pints flowing past legal selling time and maybe half a dozen faces\nhaving a laugh and talking about an\nobscure and random topic like postmodernist Italian cinema or the fall of\ncalligraphy as an everyday art-form or\nsomething equally befuddling to your\nbrain. You desperately want to be part\nof it but you do not belong to this secret society for you do not work at any\nestablishment where lock-in happens;\nnor do you actually know anyone who\nworks at a pub that could potentially\ninvite you.\nWell, you might know someone, but\nthey hate you because you have never\nbeen invited for lock-in by anyone\nand hence will not invite you. It\u2019s that\ndreadful cycle where you think you\nhave no way in, similar to that whole\n\u201cin order to get work experience you\nmust have work experience\u201d conun-drum. Quite recently however, I have\nbeen fortunate enough to have been\nin many lock-ins at a really fun pub in\nTottenham Court Road, and it is every\nbit as good as I imagined it to be. Besides the paramount pleasure of being able to smoke cigarettes indoors\nthrough the night, I was inundated\nwith good conversation (of which I understood a fair amount) and made even\nbetter friends. I am thankful that there\nis someone in my life who has noticed\nthat something like that would be an\neasy way to break my monotony and\nmake me happy. If you ask nicely, I may\nbring you along next time I go.\nThere\u2019s\nsomething I\nhave wondered\nabout and only\njust very recently\nmanage to\nexperience \u2013\nlock-in at a pub.\u201d\n\n"

After their disappointing last\nplace finish last season, the more experienced squad, further bolstered by the\naddition of a couple of gifted finishers,\nset out this season to avenge their battered reputation.\nCardiff, always the southern conference favourites, were unsettled after\na rare 3-6 defeat to the Devils before\nChristmas. However slip ups against\nOxford and Bristol in away games\nleft the Devils one game behind the\nWelsh team going into their final\nmatch against each other. This match\ncounted two-fold as the last match of\nthe Southern Conference, but also as\nthe semi-final for the playoffs for the\nnational division, in which Cardiff\nand Imperial were drawn against each\nother reguardless of who finished first\nor second in the conference. So, a win\nfrom Imperial would ensure a place in\nthe play off final, but only a win by 4\ngoals would take them to the national\nfinal with the Southern Conference\nsnatched from Cardiff.\nThe game started hard with the\nDevil\u2019s defence and netminder placed\nunder constant pressure, struggling to\nfind a rhythm against the Redhawks\nonslaught. As the half-way point of the\nfirst period passed, Imperial started\nmounting their own attacks, which\npaid off when Tom Koch broke the\ndeadlock 14 minutes in, assisted by\nChris Clough.\nImperial made it harder from them\nselves when Chris Clough was then\ngiven 2 minutes for tripping. The team\nshowed resilience however and Koch\ngot his second goal while Imperial were\ndown one man at 17 minutes, leaving\nthe first period Cardiff 0-2 Imperial.\nImperial were quick off the mark in the\nsecond period, with Clough back on\nthe score sheet 2 minutes in, giving the\nDevils an unprecedented 3 goal lead.\nThis did not please Cardiff whose frustration was shown when Evan Juurakko, the season\u2019s highest penalty taker,\ndropped his gloves to entice Imperial\u2019s\nFreddie Hellander into a fight, getting a\n2 -minute penalty for roughing. Playercoach Vince Miller further increased\nImperial\u2019s lead, with an individual effort at 27 minutes. The disillusioned\nCardiff side hinted at a fightback when\nAlyn Wallace skated by Imperial\u2019s confused defence and scored unassisted\nmaking the score 4-1 to Imperial College. But after avoiding trouble earlier\nin the match, Freddie Hellander was\ngiven a 2 minute penalty for holding,\nleaving the team with potential trou-ble, eased slightly when Cardiff picked\nup their own penalty 30 seconds later,\nDavid Williams getting 2 minutes for\nhigh sticks.\nThe beginning of the third and final\nperiod saw goals replaced by penalties\nwith Imperial\u2019s Paul Gilmartin and Ilya\nSmirnov receiving 2 minutes for un-sportsman like conduct and tripping\nrespectively.Howeverthreequickgoals\nin the final 8 minutes by Chris Clough\nand Tom Koch getting his third and\nfourth of the match, closed the door\non Cardiff, with a final score of Cardiff\nRedhawks 1-7 Imperial College Devils.\nThis 6 goal win gave the Devils their\nfirst ever conference win and first trip\nto the play off finals against the winner of Manchester and Huddersfield\nfor the national division 2 title on 19th\nof April.\nGeorge Garnier - www.georgegarnier.com\nPostman Pask delivers Imperial I to 12th\nStroke Adam Freeman-Pask was instrumental in leading the top IC crew\nto 12th position overall in the biggest\nhead race of the season. The all-IC\ncrew was comprised of four college\nfreshers and finished second in the S2\ncategory in 18:18.72.\nTideway Scullers\u2019 School I were the\noverall winners finishing in a time\nof 17:25.21. Sculler\u2019s crew included\nAlan Campbell (Olympian/Sculler\u2019s\nHead of the River Champion), Iztop\nCop (Olympic Gold), Mahe Drysdale\n(World Champion, Olympic bronze),\nOlaf Tufte (Olympic Gold) and Ondrej Synek (Olympic Silver). Despite\nthe hired guns the win is attributed to\nex-Imperial cox Ali Williams who in\na limited time transformed the single\nscullers into a crew of sweep rowers.\nRumour has it they made the switch to\nsweep rowing as a result of becoming\nbored out of their sculls. The standard\nof competition in the HORR following an Olympic year is always toughest\nmaking Imperial\u2019s 12th place ranking\neven more poignant. The crew were\nsatisfied with the result and Pask feels\nhe\u2019s a really happy man.\nIC I (Adam Freeman-Pask, Leo Carrington, Ole Tietz, Henry Goodier, Simon Hislop, Josh Yerrell, Dan CadouxHudson, Danny Bellion) were coxed\nby Henry Fieldman (12th/409 overall,\n2nd/81 in S2). The crew missed out\non the University pennant to Oxford\nBrookes by 20 seconds. Brookes is\none of the top-ranked university clubs\nin the country and have consistently\nbeen a thorn in the side of IC crews.\nBoy-siders Carrington, Goodier, Yerrell and Bellion have set high standards\nfor emerging fresher talent at Imperial and their break into the first eight\nbodes well for the coming years. Head\nCoach Steve Trapmore gave an uplifting speech to all crews before individual crew chats: \u201cYou know what it\u2019s\nlike, you\u2019ve all done this race before\u201d, at\nwhich point Bowman Bellion revealed\n\u201cEh, well I haven\u2019t actually.\u201d\nThe crew set-off at number 2 following last year\u2019s strong performance from\na crew featuring IC\u2019s George Whittaker, Freeman-Pask and Hislop, but was\nineligible for the University pennant.\nCox Henry Fieldman was ecstatic, if\nnot incomprehensible with this year\u2019s\nresult, \u201c12th f*cking place after an Olympic f*cking year, with half the crew\nf*cking freshers. That\u2019s f*cking awesome man! FML!\u201d The Henry Fieldman Express was in top gear coming\nthrough the final hundred metres and\non-looking alumni on ICBC\u2019s balcony\nattested to \u201chearing the boat sing.\u201d\nThe upset of the day came with the\ndefeat of IC II by the hands of arch-nemesis IC III who ranked 6 places\nhigher (70th overall) than the second\nboat (76th overall). When crew selections were finalised for the race there\nwas disappointment in the third boat\nas many felt they had performed better in training than those chosen for\nIC II. But the crew should have been\ndelighted not to be banished to the second boat because as Dan Topolski put\nit: \u201cThere is no joy in coming second,\nbecause to be second is to be last.\u201d The\nsecond boat, or \u201cbanter boat\u201d were out-gunned by the third who made a gallant effort in the black stallion Vespoli.\nIC III (Tom Bell, Tom Arnott, Gareth\nBrown, Kieron Docherty, Iain Palmer,\nMike Zammit, John Davey, Andy Gordon) were coxed by Nicola Quinn-Pyatt and finished in 18:53.16 (8th/91 in\nS3, 70th/409 overall).\nIC II (James Wedlake, Will Todd,\nJohn Dick, Richard Winchester, Dom\nMeyrick-Cole, Adam Mayall, Adam\nSeward, Alex Gillies) were coxed by\nConnie Pidoux and finished in 18:56.63\n(76th/409 overall, 8th/81 in S2). The\ncrew were devastated by the result and\nwere barely able to face IC III, whose\ndelight could not be contained. It was\nclear when they came off the water that\nthe crew was not pleased with their\nrow. A steady rhythm could not be\nfound and they had to bludgeon their\nway through the course. Will Todd and\nChristina Duffy\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nRichard Winchester sought comfort in\neach other and disappeared after the\nrace to be alone together.\nIn the novice camp, IC IV performed\nwell. (Sean Delaney, John Beaty,\nRory Fallon, Thomas Walshe, Benjamin Fahs, Patrick Hudson, Andreas\nPr\u00f8sch, Alistair Larsson) were coxed\nby Deepika Reddy and finished in\n19:37.87 (187th/409, 4th/60 in Novice\ncategory).\nThus ends the head race season and\nwe can finally look ahead to regatta\nracing; an entirely different form of\npain. Post race celebrations began in\nWalkabout and all camps were satisfied after wins from both England and\nIreland in the Six Nations Rugby. (Ire-land became Six Nations Grand Slam\nChampions\u2026 England came second).\nLondon RC attracted a huge crowd\nof intoxicated rowers for the jungle-themed after party. Moshing, table\ndancing and naked swimming in the\nThames all made for a thoroughly enjoyable evening.\nThe men\u2019s squad will have a brief\nrespite from intense training this week\nbefore the entire club jets off to Italy on\nSaturday for Easter training camp.\nCox: Henry Fieldman, Adam Freeman-Pask, Leo Carrington, Ole Tietz, Henry Goodier, Simon Hislop, Josh\nYerrell, Dan Cadoux-Hudson & Danny Bellion\nImperial come 2nd in IDEA\nLeague held in Aachen\nContinued from back page\nImperial Boat Club enter\nGuinness World Book of\nRecords, just\nEarlier this year, Reporter wrote about\nthe day the IC Boat Club broke a very\nspecial world record. Steve Trapmore\nMBE, Head of Rowing, describes the\nday.\n\u201cOn 11 March I took a team of Imperial College Boat Club rowers to Dorney Rowing Lake, venue for the 2012\nOlympic Regatta. Helped by coach\nStu Whitelaw, we set out to attempt a\nworld record for the fastest time a rowing eight can tow a water-skier over\n100 metres.\u201d\nThe current record stood at 19.9 sec-onds, held by a French team. After a\ncouple of failed attempts with celebri-ties, including ex Blue Peter presenter\nKonnie Huq, waterski professional\nStuart Marston took up the reins.\nStraight off, the Imperial rowers powered Stuart over a faultless 100 metres\nwhich we clocked at 19.3 seconds. Annoyingly the Guinness World Records\nadjudicator clocked the same attempt\ntwo seconds slower!\nTrapmore went on to say that \u201cAfter pointing out that we were perhaps\nmore experienced at timing rowing\ncrews, I invited the adjudicator to follow the attempt in the Sport Imperial truck rather than from a safety\nboat on the water. This did the trick,\nand although we timed the run faster,\nthe official verdict was 19.58 seconds,\nbreaking the previous world record by\nalmost 0.4 seconds.\u201d\nImperial Devils looking cool as ice after their win against Cardiff (yes it is a bit of a lame pun)\nThe rowers with Stuart Marston after they broke the world record\npicture courtesy of reporter\nphoto by neil mossley\nClaire Taylor with support from Team Fit on the leg press challenge\nble-tennis battle kicked into full swing,\nImperial Judo was showing the other\nthree universities (Delft-Netherlands,\nAachen-Germany and Zurich-Switzerland) a little bit of Imperial finesse,\ncomfortably winning and boosting our\nconfidence for the next day.\nThat evening was spent in the town,\nwith most of \u201cTeam Fit\u201d retiring early\nto prepare for what was to be a very\ntiring day, and the Floor Ball fraternity\nstill very unsure as to the exact rules.\nThursday morning drew in, and\nafter a decidedly less than adequate\nsleep on the gym floor, Imperial ladies\ntook to the Floor Ball arena- still no\nwiser about the rules. The match was\nalways going to be tough, but a 13-3\nloss did not reflect Imperial\u2019s ability,\nlikewise the men would struggle in\nthe first two games. By the third and\nfinal game, however, the ladies had\nnotched up a 3-2 victory over Delft,\nand the men were only 2-1 down deep\ninto the second half also against Delft.\nUnfortunately, the keen forward Jack\nCornish got \u2018hit on the head with the\nball\u2019 whilst just having a casual jump.\nThis was in breach of the rules and he\nwas penalised with a two minute sin-bin; the only one of the tournament!\nThis left IC with only three outfield\nplayers. They managed to hang on for\nthat time, but didn\u2019t manage to win.\nHowever, the ladies\u2019 victory secured\na respectable 3rd place, considering\nthe majority of the players had never\nplayed Floor Ball before!\nThe evening was then a classic, starting with a formal dinner at the premier\nUniversity venue. The alcohol was certainly in abundance allowing spirits to\nfly high and friendships to be forged.\nTo the amazement of Imperial, the\nscoring system had worked out in our\nfavour and we had managed a commendable 2nd place overall! The champagne continued to flow on the tables\nof Team IC, before we were ushered to\nthe most prestigious club in Aachen.\nCelebrations continued into the small\nhours, but not without incident\u2026 but\nwe certainly can\u2019t remember them!\nThe next day, IC clearly took the trophy for bar heavyweights, with many\ncontenders for the top ten headaches.\nAn enjoyable three days saw success,\nfriendships and celebrations, none of\nwhich would have been possible without the backing of Sport Imperial and\nso a big thank you goes to them from\nall of us. We all look forward to Floor\nBall next year.\n\n"

One of the\nbiggest results from the survey was the\nfact that students would much rather\nprefer to see a live band over a live act.\nThe other big result from the survey\nwas that a whopping 83% of the students told felix that it was the people\nand not the acts that make the night,\nwith one student commenting that \u201cI\ndidn\u2019t really care who the acts were, it\nwas Freshers\u2019 Week, I would have gone\nalong anyway.\u201d Another result that\ncame from the survey was the cost of\nthe tickets for the big blow-out finale\non the Friday of Freshers\u2019 Week, with\n70% of the students questioned thinking that the \u00a314.50 ticket price was too\nexpensive for what was on offer.\nThe general consensus amongst\nthe student body was that for any big\nevent, whether it be Freshers\u2019 Week,\nend of term Carnival or the Summer\nBall, people are going to come along no\nmatter who the acts are, and if they\u2019re\ngoing to pay a fair bit for their ticket,\nthey want something good. In the recent International Student Barometer\nsurvey, Imperial was rated bottom for\nentertainment enjoyment out of all the\nRussell Group universities; even below\nour own Medical School. A problem\nthat seems to have been occurring over\nthe past few years is that there has been\nlittle input from the student body into\nwhat they want in terms of entertainment from their Union, or what could\nbe even more worrying is that their input has just been ignored.\nIt does seem, however, that they have\nfinally started to lis-ten, with the Easter\n\u201cCredit Crunch\u201d\nCarnival being a\nprime ex-ample. The theme was elegant to say\nthe least: keep it simple, keep it cheap.\nThis is exactly what they did with tickets only costing \u00a35, no major headline\nacts that would cost several thousand\npounds and, as expected, the Union\nwas full with around 1,200 students\nhaving a great night. Following on\nfrom the success of the Easter \u201cCredit\nCrunch\u201d Carnival, it seems that the\nUnion has decided to yet again listen\nto its students.\nThis year\u2019s Summer Ball, which takes\nplace on the 20th June, promises to be\na great hit with acts that will satisfy a\nvast range of students. The ticket pric-es, however, are more than last year,\nwith ICU commenting that \u201cTicket\nprices this year have risen owing to\nseveral factors, costs of organising the\nevent have risen, bearing in mind ticket prices for the event have remained\nstatic over the past two years. In addi-tion, this year we have also applied a\nmore rigorous budgeting process for\nthe event, taking into account more\nrealistic costs than in previous years\nand this has highlighted the need to increase ticket prices to avoid incurring a\nfinancial loss on the ball.\u201d\nIt is also reported that Imperial College have made some generous contributions to the Ball this year, including\n\u00a313,000 for general costs, the College\ncatering department donating around\n\u00a32,000 and Commercial services donating nearly \u00a310,000 to cover the\ncost of hiring the marquee after it was\nfound that Outreach, who normally\nsplit the cost of the hire, pulled out in\nthe last minute.\nThe organisers of the Ball have put on\nthree separate entertainment sections\nthis year; the live music section will\nbe in the Beit Quad where there will\nbe bands playing from 20:00 onwards.\nOn the Live Arena, the headline act for\nthe evening will be Athlete who will be\nplaying a one and a half hour live set,\nwith Rosie & The Goldbug and Tape\nthe Radio as the supporting acts of the\nnight. Joining them will be the eventual\nBattle of the Bands winner as well as\nJeff Automatic from Club NME.\nAs usual, there will be a selection of\ndrum and base acts with Pendulum (El\nHornet DJ Set) feat. MC Jakes being\nbilled as the headline act in the Dance\nVenue. Other acts include Chase &\nStatus feat. MC Rage, Scratch Perverts,\nKilla Kela and Interlope (LIVE) that\nwill be playing you into the small hours\nof the morning.\nFinally there is the Cabaret Stage\nOfficial line-up for the\nSummer Ball announced\nUnion finally listens to its students, but why did it take so long and are our students\ngoing to be at a loss? Editor in Chief, Jovan Nedi\u0107, finds out\nStudent bands to\nplay with top acts\nat Summer Ball\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 1 May 2009 felix\nNews\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nJazz and Rock Society, in conjunction with Imperial College Union are\nhosting a Battle of the Bands competi-tion, with the eventual winner playing\nalongside with Athlete, Rosie and the\nGoldbug and Tape the Radio.\nThis move by the Union is seen as a\npositive one, with ever increasing student input to the entertainments that\nare provided at the Union.\nThe competition will consist of three\nheats, held on the 7th, 14th and 21st\nMay, followed by a final on Friday, May\n29th. A top selection of judges will be\nat the event deciding on the different\nwinners, these include; Hannah Theodorou who is Deputy President (Edu-cation & Welfare) and a massive fan of\nGoldfrapp , as well as Kadhim Shubber,\nDeputy Editor of felix, who\u2019s claims his\nfavourite artist at the moment is Laura\nMarling.\nEach battle will start from 19:00 in\ndB\u2019s, entry will cheap and there will be\na raffle at the end where the first prize\nill be free tickets to this year\u2019s Summer Ball. The bands will be playing a\nmixture of covers and their own songs\nthroughout the night so there will be\nsomething for everyone. There might\nalso be a possibility of selecting one of\nthe finalists from the runners-up by\nmeans of an online vote.\nSo if you are interested in having a\ndirect input into what you listen to at\nthe Summer Ball, then go along and\nsupport your favourite band, either\nthat or bribe the official judges. I hear\nthe Deputy Editor has a particular liking for Innocent Smoothies and chocolate Brownies!\n\u201cWe don\u2019t\nforesee that\nany IC students\nwill be unable\nto purchase an\nentertainments\nticket due to\nan external\ncustomer taking\nthat place\u201d - ICU\nRosie & The Goldbug Tape the Radio Scratch Perverts\nChase & Status\nGlobe Girls\nof an increased capacity, which allows\nfor 1000 extra attendees than we have\never sold before, we don\u2019t foresee that\nany Ic students will be unable to purchase an entertainments ticket due to\nan external customer taking that place.\nIn addition we are monitoring ticket\nsales closely throughout this period to\nensure that if we are approaching capacity that the ability for externals to\npurchase tickets will be removed.\u201d\nSeveral students were also concerned\nas to why the line-up wasn\u2019t announced\nearlier so that they could take advantage of the early tickets, to which ICU\nreplied \u201cWe have withheld the line-up\nuntil this point as we awaited a full set\nof contracted acts. In previous years we\nhave released acts based on provisional\ncontracts and we have been let down.\nWe have attempted to avoid a situation\nwhere tickets have been purchased\nbased on a line-up which is not 100%\ncertain, to avoid disappointment.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition we aim for students to\nmake their decision to attend the ball\nbased on a line-up in it\u2019s entirety and\nnot on single acts. We have worked\nhard this year to ensure that there is\na wide variety of entertainment on\noffer, hopefully providing something\nfor everyone. We have based many of\nour decisions for this year\u2019s line-up on\nfeedback gained from the Trading and\nClubs & Societies surveys, particularly\nin relation to having a live arena for the\nfirst time.\u201d\nEven though the line-up this year\nis considered to be the best in recent\nyears, several students have wondered\nwhy it has taken so long for the Union\nto listen to them and if they will do in\nthe future. Only time will tell.\nPENDULUM\nATHLETE\nSince their debut album \u2018Vehicles & Animals\u2019\nin 2003, Athlete have been at the forefront of\nthe UK\u2019s indie rock scene playing to crowds\naround the world.\nTheir first album was met with critical and\ncommercial success producing singles such\nas \u2018You Got the Style\u2019 and \u2018El Salvador. For\ntheir second album \u2018Tourist\u2019, Athlete scored\ntheir biggest hit-to-date \u2018Wires\u2019 which went\non to win a coveted Ivor Nevello award for\nBest Contemporary Song. \u2018Beyond the Neighbourhood\u2019 was released in September 2007\nreaching number 5 in the UK album chart and\nspawning the hit single \u2018Hurricane\u2019. They are\ncurrently working on their fourth studio album and are about to embark on an intimate\nUK tour ahead of its release.\ni.e. not a live set... AGAIN\n(El Hornet DJ SET)\nNOEL FIELDING &\nDAVE BROWN\nNoel Fielding, star of the BBC\u2019s Mighty Boosh and his Gorilla costume-toting friend Dave Brown are here\nto offer a roller coaster trip through their unique minds! Noel and Dave explain more: \u2018The Doctor came to\nLondon from Eastern Europe in 1876, he rode into town on a mule dragging a half man half pencil behind\nhim on a pencil case the size of a hospital stretcher. The pencil woke up with no recollection of the great\njourney, frightened, incensed and slightly jet-lagged he ran straight to London Zoo and skewered a pack\nof rare monkeys making the worlds largest marmaset kebab.\u2019 That clears that one up then! Expect great\ncomedy, superb music and much laughter.\nwhich will host a variety of live performances which include the Globe\nGirls and Imperial\u2019s very own Jazz Big\nBand. Headlining the Cabaret stage\nthis year will be Noel Fielding and\nDave Brown, better known as The\nDoctor and the Pencil. The duo from\nthe hit TV show The Mighty Boosh\nhave joined forces to bring you a live\nshow that is certain to have you rolling\nin the isles.\nAs well as live music and DJ sets, the\nSummer Ball will also have other attractions to keep you entertained into\nthe small hours of the morning, such\nas the Giant Fun Fair and of course the\nsurvivors breakfast and photo.\nThe line-up for the Ball is meant to\nbe a close guarded secret to ensure\nmaximum impact, however, rumours\nof some of the acts have been circulating after a few of bands advertised\nthe event on their website. Athlete\nhave even been telling their fans on\ntheir website that \u201cAlthough the event\nis aimed at students of the college it\nis not an exclusive gig and tickets are\navailable.\u201d This has left several students\nworried that there will not be enough\ntickets available for Imperial students,\nhowever, a statement sent by Imperial\nCollege Union stated that \u201cAs a result\nStudents at the Survivors Photo from last year\u2019s Summer Ball\nPhoto by Ian Gillett\nIC Big Band win\nGold Award at\nNational Festival\nHaving wiped the floor with the competition at the regional heat of the\nNational Concert Band Festival, the\nImperial College Big Band travelled\nto the Royal Welsh College of Music\nand Drama in Cardiff to play in the\nnational finals of the festival over the\nEaster break. Despite having to catch\na coach from college at 7am, the band\nwere in fine form under the direction\nof Andy Simm, opening their set with\nTom Kubis\u2019 up tempo tune, \u2018On Purple\nPorpoise Parkway\u2019. The band captured\nthe essence of Don Menza\u2019s classic,\n\u2018Groovin\u2019 Hard\u2019, and the set ended with\nPat Metheny\u2019s technically intricate\n\u2018The First Circle\u2019, which allowed the sax\nsection to indulge in some jazz flute\nplaying that would put Ron Burgundy\nto shame.\nDespite tough competition from\nother regional winners the band were\npresented with a gold award, the only\ngroup in the \u2018open big band\u2019 category\nJon Dennis\nThere\u2019s always one person that decides not to look at the camera\nto do so. The judges praised the band\u2019s\ntight ensemble playing, commenting\nthat the set was a \u2018most enjoyable performance\u2019 and one they \u2018would happily\nhave paid to see\u2019. The soloing interplay of saxophonists Jamie McDougall\nand James Trippett was described as\n\u2018lovely\u2019, whilst Chaz Keiderling and his\nhorn were commended for reaching an\n\u2018appropriately timed climax\u2019 that put a\nsmile on the judges\u2019 faces.\nThis outstanding result shows the IC\nBig Band to be one of the top university big bands in the country and is the\ncrowning achievement of a successful\nyear for the band. Having enjoyed the\nunique cultural experience that Wales\nhas to offer, the band will be taking\ntheir award-winning jazz on tour to\nBerlin in September. Their next performance will be in the MDH at the\nSummer Ball on 20th June, and promises to be one of the highlights of the\nball.

This makes\nthe Camden Crawl (24th\n- 25th\nApril)\nthe perfect place to enjoy the very\nbest of what London\u2019s up and coming music scene has to offer. A quick\ntube ride away and you\u2019re in Camden High Street, home of London\u2019s\n\u2018alternative\u2019 music scene. Right on\nour doorstep, you don\u2019t need to get\na train back home, so you can stay\nuntil four in the morning to party.\nYay!\nCamden Town is full of great\nclubs and bars, with a music style\nsure to cater to you. Weather it be\nIndie, Trance, Electro, Punk, Rock,\nFolk or anything else you can think\nof!\nFirstly, collect your wristband.\nA simple affair, you hand in your\nticket and are rewarded with a plastic wristband, a map, and a booklet\ncontaining information on every\nband playing (over 150!). Personally I was like \u201cFUCK YEAH\u201d to\nthe Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and thusly my\ncompanions and I queued up at the\nMTV stand to get an extra wristband for this for an hour and a half!\nLuckily, the sunny weather and ice\ncream van made this bearable.\nIn Camden, the fun starts early;\nthe afternoons were filled with\nplenty of live bands performing in\nsmall pubs with great atmosphere.\nOf particular note were the King\nBlues, who seemed to be playing\neverywhere (including the MySpace\nBus). We saw them at the Island\nRecords 50th birthday party at the\nConstitution Pub. However, to get\nto this pub we had to take a boat\nride. Fun, but I\u2019m sure unnecessary.\nAfter spending the afternoon in\na pub drinking, it was the general\nconsensus that food at the Camden\nLock would be great. This legendary\nplace is home to food from all over\nthe world, being practically thrown\nin your face. The Food Editor who\naccompanied me suddenly decided\nto visit the infamous shop, Cyberdog. OMFG this place is WEIRD!\nI\u2019ve been before and love how cool\nthe place is, and the music that is\nplayed there, but let\u2019s be honest, the\npeople working there look like third\ngeneration freaks. It scares me. Ah\nwell, time to drink.\nWhen it came to the evenings, it\nwas time to see some real bands!\nThe highlight for the first day was, of\ncourse, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Man\nthat chick is cool... and hot. I\u2019ll tell\nyou who else was awesome though:\nDatarock. They were so camp and\nfull of energy, much like the Food\nEditor Afonso Campos. After the\npartying of Day One, it was time to\nrest and head on to Day Two.\nThe second day was even better\nthan the first, with awesome bands\nlike the The Computers, being a lot\nof fun. But the steal of the show was\ndefinitely the amazing DJ set from\nCount + Sinden. I\u2019ve never been\nso sweaty in my life, raving to their\nhard core Drum & Bass as well as\nsick Dub Step tunes.\nThe Camden Crawl is a definite\nmust for students. With a weekend\nticket costing only \u00a360, it\u2019s something that should definitely not be\nmissed next year!\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n12 felix Friday 1 May 2009\nFood & Drink\nFood & Drink Editors \u2013 Rosie Grayburn & Afonso Campos\nAfonso Campos\nFood Editor\nVegans may\nactually be OK\nA students guide to wine\ninto a glass, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s possible to\naccomplish this without too much of\na judder. All in all, wine is a drunkard\nstudent\u2019s best friend.\nAs utopian a symbiotic relationship with wine it is that I describe,\nthere comes a point that \u2018drinkability\u2019\nbecomes a less compelling factor. In\nshort, you realise that you\u2019re one of (a)\na ponce, (b) old, (c) rich or (d) orally\nfixated. At this point wine becomes a\nrather more fascinating subject. You\nliterally find yourself reading the wine\narticles in the Guardian magazine.\nWhat could possibly drive one to such\ndespicable extremes?\nDepends whom you ask, really. To the\nFrench (who are usually fairly convincing in matters of the taste-buds) a wine\nis its personality. It has to be a strong\npersonality: recognisable and in a clear\ntradition. To many an Australian, wine\nis a commercial product, which can be\ndone badly or well and they don\u2019t put\ntoo much stock in the Old World voo-doo. To many an American, a wine is\nas good as it is big -- high alcohol, high\nconcentration and served in a nice big\nheavy bottle.\nWell, whatever the motivation, different wines do taste different and where\nyou have differences, you have differences of opinion. Noticing these differences can be great fun. If you\u2019re a fan\nof white, try the following experiment.\nGet a friend. Go to the bar. One of you\nget a glass of Chardonnay (oaked if pos-sible) and the other get a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. Swap the glasses about a\nbit so you don\u2019t know which is which.\nSwirl the liquid in the glass a bit. Taste\nthem both making sure to smell while\nyou drink. These two grapes usually\nproduce wines which are poles apart:\none of them will be more neutral, tasting of melons, apricots, possibly a little\nbutter or vanilla, depending on how it\u2019s\nmade -- that\u2019ll be the Chard. The other\nwill taste of grapefruit, elderflower,\npassionfruit, possibly a little cat\u2019s piss\nif you know that smell or even B.O. -that\u2019ll be the Sauvignon.\nIt\u2019s fascinating isn\u2019t it? The recipe\nafter all is essentially the same: grape\njuice left to go bad. But what\u2019s your\nfavourite? Once you can answer that\nquestion, you\u2019re half way there. And\nonce you\u2019re over the threshold, the\npossibilities are endless. A wine is after all a function of a huge number of\nparameters: grape variety, soil com-position, total rainfall, total sunshine,\nripeness of grapes at harvest, winemaking techniques including optional\nsecondary fermentation, lees-stirring,\noak ageing, bottle ageing\u2026 the list is\nendless.\nThe result: you have every taste from\nchocolate pudding to smoky bacon\ncrisps to tinned asparagus to treacle\ntart with custard. All you\u2019ve got to do\nis think about what you\u2019re drinking\n(and possibly spend a little more than\n3.99 - say 4.99 to start with - see how\nyou go).\nHere are some cheap but good suggestions from the best place which is\nclose and cheap: Waitrose.\nI\n\u2019d tried the stuff before being\nan undergrad, of course, but\nthe main use of wine in social\nsituations was, as far as I and my\nfriends were concerned, the op-timising choice of parameter for a payoff function of drunkedness with constraints on time, cost and maximum\ndisgustingness of the intoxicant.\nBeer didn\u2019t really cut it: you can try\nto get drunk on beer if you like (and\nmany do employ this method to great\neffect), but you are fundamentally limited on volume. The human stomach\ncan take two pints. Even if you can cue\nup a third somewhere else in the sys-tem, at a paltry 5% alcohol you need at\nleast two hours of fairly committed effort to get (un)acceptably sloshed.\nSpirits are a step too far, though.\nLarge amounts of gin, for instance, are\nnotoriously bad for emotional stability:\nnext time you\u2019re around a(nother) girl\ngive her loads of gin and see what hap-pens. To reach a tolerable level of drink-ability in Scotch, you need to spend at\nleast twenty quid a bottle, then you\u2019ll\nonly end up giving most of it away and\nregret the whole sordid affair the next\nday with the feeling that someone had\npumped mercury into your ears while\nyou slept. And whatever anyone tells\nyou, vodka is disgusting.\nWith wine on the other hand, a bottle\ncan be polished off within about fifteen\nminutes -- then it\u2019s simply a matter of\nfine-tuning. There\u2019s also the downabil-ity factor: if you find yourself invited to\n\u2018save the queen\u2019 (a penny) when tossed\nDavid Stewart gives his oneology views on the

term, another\nrampage of food sections\nto keep you well-fed\nand your tummy happy\nthrough a period that\ncannot be easy on any self-respecting\nImperial student who wants to come\nback to university by the end of a glorious fun-filled summer. Sometimes\nI catch myself thinking that I am not\nthat student, and that with something\nresembling a frail certainity, I might actually be that kid you heard about once\nwho got kicked out for failing his ex-ams. Immediately, upon this thought, I\nget up, look at my books and fall into a\ndeep hatred of mathematics and phys-ics, and gracefully recommence this\ncycle of pathetic self-loathing that is\nnot the most conducive to effective\nstudy.\nI do not help myself in this aspect one\nbit though. This easter holiday, I decided shun revision for a while and go to\nNew York City for about one week, and\nfoodies, let me tell you, what a holiday\nthat was. Not only did I venture there\nwith some great friends, despite the\nfood experience not being everyone\u2019s\nfavourite gourmet extravaganza, it was\nwithout the shadow of a doubt, a pornographic feast for my palate and taste\nbuds. None of it was guilt-free and I\nmust have put on more weight than I\ncare to think about, but it was worth\nevery gram and every cent. Two dining\nexperiences stick out however.\nThe first one, was right before a Ra\nRa Riot gig at Webster Hall. We were\ntaken to an incredibly small establishment that goes by the name of\nArtichoke. There was a small queue\nforming outside, and inside there was\nno seating area and just barely enough\nspace to order what was described to\nme as New York City\u2019s best slice of\npizza. These gigantic pieces not only\nfilled me up, but were without a doubt\nworthy of the hype. If you are in the\nCity soon, please, do yourself a favour\nand indulge in these blasphemously\ndelicious slices (artichoke and spinach\nrecommended).\nThe other restaurant was something\nunlike anything I have tried before.\nFoodswing\u2019s, a vegan joint in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Despite walls\ncovered in the usual hippie PETA\npropaganda and lies, the food was\nshockingly good and interesting. Bacon\ncheeseburgers, milkshakes and cheesy\nfries are not exactly the kind dishes\none would expect at a place where the\nthought of even touching an animal is\nenough to sicken the waiter. Through\nclever use of tofu and flavourings, we\nwere presented with something that\nnon only resembled meat, it tasted\nquite similar if not oddly better. The\nbuffalo faux-chicken wings were to die\nfor and the peanut-butter \u2018milk\u2019shake\nwas galactic. Try these if you go.\nWhite:\nRobert Mondavi - Woodbridge Chardonnay 06 \u00a36.99 (Oaky, exotic, yet restrained)\nCardeto 2007 Orvieto Classico, Umbria, Italy \u00a33.79 (Light, perfumed, typically Italian)\nJoseph Leitz 2007 Riesling Pfalz, Germany \u00a37.99 (German wine can be dry and zingy)\nRed:\nClassic 2007 C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne \u00a33.99 (Spicy, light, yet warm)\nSalduba Garnacha 2007 Cari\u00f1ena, Spain \u00a34.99 (Fat, chocolatey, fruity)\n\n"
