    "content": "I One Nuclear Bomb Can\nRuin Your Whole Day'\nFire From The Ashes\nEdited By Kenzaburo Oe\nNo slogans, no banners, no\nCND Signs. Just ordinary\npeople telling us that 'a nuclear bomb really can\nruin your whole day'. This\nis the first ever collection in\nEnglish by Japanese\nwriters on one of todays\nmost urgent and universal\nthemes and its well timed\nrelease marks forty years\nsince the bombings of\nHiroshima and Nagasoki.\nMany of the authors are\nthemselves sur viv i or s of\nthese bombings and\nalthough the book places\nno blame, nor offers any\nsolution, it is nevertheless\nvital reading for anyone\nwishing to enter the\nnuclear debate. After\nreading this book my\noverriding feeling is one of\nshock, shocked by the\nnormality of the events\nprior to the bombing,\ncontrasted with the\nabstract,factual way in\nwhich the scenes\nafterwards are presented.\nThis is an important\ncollection of short stories,\nwell worth \u00a33.50, and well\nworth reading.\nPete Wilson\nbooks A ballad is traditionally a poem narrating a popular\nstory, but I'm not sure that\nThe Ballad of Typhoid\nMary would be a popular\ntale at all. It is about Mary\nMallon, a typhoid carrier\nwho was immune to the\ndisease but dealt death to\nthousands of New Yorkers\nfor whom she cooked.\nShe embarked from an\nemigrant ship on which 436\ni\\\\m' out of 544 passengers,\nincluding all of her family,\nhad died and fell straight in\nto the clutches of a pae dio phil ic doctor.\nDorfheimer liked little girls,\nbut this one cooked him\nscrambled eggs; he died.\nAfter that came a succession of posts where\nMary cooked fragrant,\nambrosia l meals for her\nemployers\u2014usually ending\nup killing them within a fortnight. Eventually a particularly evil character,\nhaving identified her as the\nnow legendary 'Typhoid\nMary', employed her to\nlook after a young Downs\nSyndrome girl. Caroline\nsurvived three happy years\nwith Mary which provoked\nher guardians to take her\naway and kill her\nthemselves.\nMary's twilight years\nwere spent as a virtual\nprisoner in hospital\ngrounds, allowed out once\nevery three weeks to go\ns hoping. It is still a mystery\nhow much she knew about\nthe disease which she\ncarried, whether she\nrealised that she spread\ndeath or merely thrust the\nthought deep into her\nsubconscious. It is\ninteresting that long after\nshe turned to the church\nfor comfort she could never\npray for herself; someone\nelse pe formed the office for\nher.\nFor the amount of detail\nin this story the book is too\nlong, more saga then\nballard both in its length\nand in its macabre nature. I would have welcomed more\ninformation about the\ncentral part of her life, and\nfeel that Federspeil has\nspun out a long short story\ninto a short long story.\nPublished by King Penguin,\n'The Ballard of Typhoid\nMary' costs \u00a32.95.\nSarah Kirk\nUnfortunately for those\nwho have seen Mad Max 2,\nMad Max beyond\nThunderdome will probably\nbe a bit of a disappointment. This is not\nto say that George Miller\nhas lost any of his ability to\nhandle action, it's just that\nthere isn't enough for a genre that is noted for it's innovative and exciting\nchases. I am not sure\nwhether this is the fault of\nthe story or having brought\nin an extra director, George\nOgilvy.\nIf the nuclear apocalypse\nwasn't bad enough, Max\nstarts off in the film by\nhaving his transport stolen\nby a one-parent family\nteam of pilots. This means\nthat on arrival in\nBartertown he has nothing\nto trade except his skills,\nwhich are of course,\nsufficient to obtain him a job as a mercenary. His\nemployer, com pet ant ly played by Tina Turner, is\nAunty Entity who's control\nover the town is threatened\nby the head (and\nshoulders) of the electricity\ngenerating workers a giant/dwarf team known as\nMaster Blaster Max's task\nis to eliminate Blaster in a gladiatorial combat in a large birdcage called\nThunderdome. I don't wish\nto spoil the plot, but I will\nsay that Max's subsequent\nexile causes him to meet\nthe children of survivors of\nan air cash who welcome\nhim as the messiah who\nwill lead them to the\npromised land. This section\nFILM of the film is rather slow,\nbut the contrast probably\nenhances the fast and\nMad Max meets Flamingo Kid.\ntunes are chopped and\nbadly abused.\nThis little moral tale is\nabout yet another American\nkid growing up in yet\nanother American summer\nholiday but the film is\nredeemed by some\nexcellent acting. Richard\nCrenna's smooth talking\nsalesman leads Jeffrey,\nexciting shoot out at the\nend.\nThe sets and costumes\nare as i magni native as the\nlast film, but the nihilistic\ndesert is not exploited as\neffectively as before. The\nphotography, however, is\nlargely excellent and the\nuse of close ups of some\nexotic faces is wonderful,\nan enjoyable film.\nThe producers of Mad\nMax are obviously, aware of\nthe advertising mileage to\nbe had from music, as\nshown by Tina Turner's recent hit. Further evidence\nof the symbiotic\nrelationship between film\nand music is provided by\nThe Flamingo Kid. The film\nis set in 1963 and hence\nuses a lot of music from\nthat time, or there about s. This is very nearly a fault\nas the makers of the film\napear to have attempted to\ncram in as much nostalgic\nmusic as possible, with the\nresult that a lot of classic\nMatt Dillon, away from his\nfather's educational wishes\nwith seductive lines, such\n\"Who s. nd the\nHollywood hero\nw ns d end?!\" as 'You don't see\nphilosophers making\n$50,000 a year' and\n'Socrates rode around on a donkey'. All this leads to a fairly engaging but\nephemeral comedy.\nBy contrast the early\nsixties was also the time\nthat Jean Luc Godard was\nbegining to shock\naudiences with his\nsubversion of cinematic\nconventions and his recent\nfilm contains many of his\ntrademarks. The\nphotography, for example,\ncontrasts modern dull\nEurope in the form of cars,\nbland rooms, gas stations\nwith references to land\npoints, (from the postures\nof Mary) nature's beauty,\ngreen fields, red poppies\nand storm tossed lakes.\nThe soundtrack again uses\nmusic, Bach, Dvorak, to\nuseful effect, but being\nGodard it is often in abrupt\nsnatches between sacred\nsilences and street noises.\nThe plot is straight\nforward enough. It is a remaking of the Virgin Birth\nset in modern Switzerland.\nMary, a keen basketball\nplayer, lives in a petrol\nstation and Joseph is a taxi\ndriver. This being modern\ntimes Joseph finds Mary's pre gn a cy somewhat hard to\ncope with, as he has not\nbeen anywhere near her,\nand he suspects someone\nelse until he is 'put right' by\nan unshaven and somewhat\nheavy handed Angel\nGabriel. The family soon\nsettles down and before\nlong Jesus, surely still too\nyoung, set off 'to do his\nfather's work'.\nGodard constantly\nreminds us of Mary's spiritual nature by using\nshots of the moon. Always\na chaste and virginal\ngoddess, and even a nativity scene with all the\nappropriate animals.\nFinally, the film requires a fair degree of effort from\nthe audience but it's worthwhile to see some\ninnovative cinema work.\nJim Claydon\n10 Friday 1 November FELIX\n\n"

Not because of\nmy sometimes terrible\nsexist attitudes\u2014attitudes\nthat I have grown up with\nbut would never defend,\njustify or exhort; attitudes\nthat I strive to change\nMy hypocrisy lies in the\nfact that I, along with Mr\nJones, am a member of a Union that condemns\npornography and RSMU,\nyet does not act; a Union\nthat at fine occasions such\nas Commemoration Day\ndons an air of\nrespectability, a false\npolished sheen hiding an\ninfantile, violently\nprejudiced and sexist\norganisation.\nThat these 'fine' RSMU\ngraduates, re splenda nt in\ntheir gowns, should honour\nsuch great men as TH Huxley, and uphold 'the\nstudy of science for\nscience's sake', is, in my\nopinion, true, sickening\nhypocrisy. Students like the\nHon Pornographer, and\nother supporters of archaic\nsexist traditions, each year\ninsult my College.\nI am proud to be a student at IC, but I am not\nproud to being a party to\nthe hypocrisy of its\nstudents and Union. We are\nall gui lit y of hypocrisy.\nJoint resp on sibi l ty means\nthat we, members of ICU,\nmust be accountable for\nthis hypocrisy, even though\nit stems from a minority.\nI hope Mr Jones, and all\nof you, will join me and\nmany others in criticising\nourselves and doing\nsomething about it.\nYours sincerely\nMichael P Newman\nEditors Note: I'm quite keen\nto keep discussion going\non any subject. FELIX\nshould be open to anyone\nwho has an opinion to\nexpress. I feel, though, that\nthe correspondence on\nMichael Newman, Mike\nJones etc has gone on long\nenough. No more\ncorrespondence will be\nprinted on this subject\nunless it is excessively\nwitty or interesting\nGood Bye\nSir,\nHaving lived in the\nFremantle Hotel between\nSept 84 and July 85 I feel\nyour article last week under\nthe headline 'Good\nRiddance' was a gross\nmisrepresentation of the\nfacts, and did not do justice\nto the community spirit\nwhich developed amongst\nthe residents there.\nWhilst it is true that\nstructure ly the building was\nin a poor state of repair,\nthis was entirely due to a recalcitrant owner against\nwhose lack of concern, the\nresidents, warden and\nCollege had continually to\nstruggle in order to get\neven the most urgent\nrepairs done.\nNevertheless, due entirely\nto the good sense,\ndetermination and good\nhumour of the residents\n(particularly the first years\nand re-apps) the Fremantle\nenjoyed one of the most\nactive social lives of any of\nthe Imperial College\nresidences, and certainly\nprovided myself and many\nothers with their most\npleasant memories of life at\nImperial College.\nTherefore, it must be said\nthat many of the people\nwho actually lived in the\nHotel will greet the news of\nit burning down with very\nmixed feelings, and it is\nalso true that in terms of an\nenjoyable social\natmosphere, in my five\nyears at IC I have never\nbeen in a residence to\ncompare with it.\nYours sincerely\nRay Jones\nSubwarden\nFremantle Hotel\nWhite Noise\nDear Mr Southey,\nMy first impression of IC\nRadio was that it provided\na useful and informative\nservice to the students of\nthe college, playing a wide\nvariety of popular music.\nHowever, this cannot be\nsaid of the programme I heard on Wednesday night.\nOn returning from the\nSouthside Bar, I tuned to\nIC Radio, as many students\ndo at that time of night and\nwas subjected to idiotic\nbanter, stupid jokes\n(including something about\na competition where the\nprize was 'a night of\npassion with Madonna')\nand too much so-called\n'alternative' music. The\npresenters obviously did\nnot approach the job with\nthe same sense of\nresponsibility as do other\nIC Radio presenters.\nSo this Wednesday night,\nif the 'William and Paul'\nshow (original name isn't lit?) occupies the late slot\nthen I for one will be\nhaving an early night.\nYours sincerely\nSP White.\nPhantom Fight\nDear Hugh,\nI was fascinated to hear of\nthe antics of the 'Phantom\nSoaker' (FELIX, 25th October 1985), but was\ndisturbed by Mr Reeves'\nconcern about the\nPhantom's health.\nI feel sure that despite a non-conformist attitude of\nthe rewards due to socalled 'snobby nosed\nswot s', this anonymous\naqua phil e is quite sane.\nAfter three weeks, totting\nup in excess of a phenomenal 30 soakings,\nthe Phantom's true identity\nis still unknown. This fact\nproves that he has an\nunnatural skill in the art of\ncamouflage. His attacks on\nnoted academics and\nrespected staff show that\nhe has nerves of steel and\na constitution comparable\nto that of renowned\ndeviants.\nIf my deductions of the\nPhantom's character are\naccurate,! believe that\nhe/she will accept this\nchallenge;\nI, Andrew Vickers,\nchallenge the 'Phantom\nSoaker' to a water-fight in\nthe Round Pond (Hyde\nPark), at a time of his/her\nchoice. Weapons are water\npistols, buckets or plastic\ncarrier bags.\nI look forward to hearing\nfrom Imperial College's own notorious fiend\nthrough your newspaper.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Vickers\nYes To Indsoc\nSir,\nDesigned to cause\ncontroversy or designed to\nfill space? Surely you could\nhave spared us the drivel\ncontained in Steve\nMarshall's article last week.\nTo say that it was short on\nrational argument would be\ncharitable (though I admit\nthat it made up for this in\npure abuse!). I joined the\nIndustrial Society a couple\nof weeks ago and I'm still\ntrying to find something\nsinister about it. I for one\nfind the real problems that\nindustry faces a lot more\ninteresting than those\ncontrived for us in College.\nTo suggest that it is\nwrong to want to know\nmore about the\nopportunities available after\ncollege is obviously\nridiculous\u2014surely most\npeople want to look at a number of other\nuniversities before picking\nImperial College\u2014was that\nwrong?\nThe continuing health of\n,a company is, in part, due\nto attracting appropriate\ni new employees\u2014does Mr\ni Marshall really deprecate\nthe small cost that may be\nincurred in entertaining to\nachieve this? The\n;continuing health of\nJBritain's industry is\nimportant, if only so that\nthe wealth of taxes\ngenerated are sufficient to\nsupport those who 'choose\nother more aesthetic things\nin life'. Perhaps Mr Marshall\nis biting the hand that\nfeeds..?\nIC students have a right\nto know what goes on in\nthe outside world. They\nhave the intelligence to\nmake up their minds for\nthemselves. Any attempt to\nrepress this right by the\nUnion, due to the prejudice\nof a small number of hacks\nwho happen to have\ninfluence in the hierarchy\nwould be an act unworthy\nof a free, democratic\norganisation.\nYours,\nTrevor Power\n| Mech Eng 2\n2 Friday 1 November FELIX\n\n"

After suffering\nextensive damage it\ncontinued blindly for\nmillen i a. The years passed.\nThen in the twenty-first\ncentury, a colony ship\ndestined for Mars was\nsurreptitiously rerouted to\nTitan and only the leaders\nof the Military Industrial\nComplex knew why...'. But\nso do you pretty soon as\nevery single element of\npotential suspense in this\nbook is given away.\nMeanwhile by page 13, the\nrobots on Titan have\nevolved by the most\npreposterous chain of\nevents into life forms\ncapable of inventing sex. If\nHarry Edison had picked\nup the theme at this point it\nwould have been an\namusing book. If Isaac\nAsimov had, it might have\nbeen thought provoking. As\nI walked into the trendy\ncommunity centre in\nChelsea, sat down and\nwatched an Opera so bad\nthat it made me want to\nscream and bang my head\nagainst the wall. I was sure\nI had come to the right\nplace.\nEgad! Gadsookers! This\nwas a burlesque on\nRestoration Opera\n(1700ish \u20141770ish) performed, shall we say in\nthe style, spirit and to the\nstandard of 18th century\nOpera.\nI sat through two operas,\nThe Chaplet, about the\neternal triangle of love, and\nPyramus and Thisbe about\ntwo star-crossed or at least\nwell-separated lovers. It\nwas difficult to tell whether\nthe two works were\noriginally so droll and\nunbelievably slapstick, or if\nthey had been suitably\naltered by the company.\nit is, it's rather long. There\nare lots of quite clever\nideas and the near-future\nworld Hogan describes is\nas believable as any of\nArthur C. Clarke's novels\nbut the whole lot is blotted\nout by clumsy writing. The\nconcept of a robot\ncivilisation where the roles\nof organic and synthesized\nmaterials are reversed\nseems inventive: but by\nusing it as a direct analogy\nof the entire history of the\nhuman race, and littering it\nwith names reeking of post-Tolkien drivel, most of the\npossibilities are wasted.\nAnd as for a latter-day\nNASA hiring psychics, God\n(and there is religious\nphilosophy a plenty) only\nknows why this\ncomplication was\nnecessary. This book\nshows that it is difficult to\ncombine the stories of\nGalileo, I, Robot and the\ncomplete works of Arthur\nC. Clarke into one volume.\n40p pages of stumbling,\nnear-future philo soph ising for \u00a32.95. Methinks\nsomeone was trying to\nwrite 2001 and got 1002.\nThe singing was fair, just\nthe odd rushed beat that\nhad the orchestra wince\nand pause, and very well\nthey played too, all eleven\nof them.\nThe two high points of the\nevening were, for me, the\nwall in Pyramus and\nThisby, and the finale. The\nwall seemed to imagine\nthat it was a person\ncovered in carpet tiles, and\nhence kept on turning\nround and knocking\nunconscious members of\nthe cast. At the finale came\na highly contrived audience\nriot, where upon a signal\nwe all shouted and pelted\nthe cast with Brussel\nsprouts and plastic fruit.\nImperial Opera, the\naugust dodos that provided\nus with this entertainment,\nwas founded in 1979 by a bunch of Ex-IC students\nand their associates. Since\nthen they have performed\nmany operas, by\ncomposers as diverse as\nPurcell, Hoist, Offenbach\nand Dvorak. They hope to\nperform Salad Days in\nGuernsey, sorry folks, and\nRuddigore by Gilbert and\nSullivan at the Secombe\nCentre (wherever that is) in\nOctober.

    "content": "I By Ratfink\nI have to begin this week\nwith a minor correction to\nlast week's column. The\nfemale fresher which Mr\nTony Spencer, failed\nBroadsheet editor, was\nseen escorting back to\nEvelyn Gardens was in fact\nmale. Sorry Tony.\nSpeaking of editors,\nhowever, brings me round\nto a field always rich in\neccentricity. Probably as a result of the fact that\nediting any college\npublication requires a warped mind and a degree\nof dedicated lu nancy these\nI people rarely have a low\n: profile. Our own ex halted; editor Hugh Southey is\n| already known for his wild\n! mannerisms, hopping\n(around and waving his\narms in the air. Indeed so\nhyperactive is Mr Southey\nthat one person already\nthis term confused his\nnormal behaviour with an\noverdose of amphetamine\ndiet pills. Is the strain of\neditorship getting to the\nman? Jokingly it has been\nsuggested that Mr Southey\nis in fact the psychotic\nphantom so aker still at\nlarge in College. And now\nto fuel this rumour comes\nthe story that when one\nFELIX reporter went to\ncheck the handwriting the\nletter published in last\nweeks FELIX had vanished\nwithout trace!\nThe most deranged\neditors of all are those of\nthe C CU papers of course.\nNow, following the\ntemporary departure from\ncollege of previous editor\nMark Cottle, Guildsheet has\nbeen largely in the hands\nof the progressively more\nrotund duplicating officer\nAdrian Johnson. Mr Cottle\nhimself gained a certain\nnotoriety before untimely\nbrain damage and personal\ncircumstances terminated\nhis reign, but Mr Johnson\nhas been trying hard for\nthe really big league.\nCuddly Adrian's escapades\noccur at night when he\nsleepwalks. During the\nsummer he developed a tendency to get into bed\nwith his room mates in the\nmiddle of the nigh f. So\ndeep was his trance that\nthe only means Guilds VP Symon Corns could find to\nrepel the invasion was\nseveral swift blows across\nthe backside with a shoe\n(kinky these Guildsmen).\nFollowing this our hero\ntransfered his attention to\nthe wardrobe, in which he\nfound himself awakening\none morning. The final and\nmost gross tale occured\nafter one of the Guilds\nfresher s buffets when the\nrotund one was 'crashing\nout' in a friends nearby\nroom. The slumbering\nwanderer found the urge\non this occasion to relieve\nhimself during his travels,\nand picked as his spot his\nhost's bed.

    "content": "Man in the Eye\nPeter Hallsworth\nIf you're in College accommodation and your roof\nleaks, the floor's rotten or the windows haven't been\ncleaned the man ultimately res posible is Peter\nHallworth. His full title is Managing Surveyor\n(Residences) and his role is to centrally administer the\nmaintenance and up-grading of buildings and the\nadministration of housekeepers and cleaners. This\nweek FELIX interviewed Mr Hallworth to hear his views\non the existing housing stock and the recent\nimprovement programme he has begun.\nPeter Hallworth is a quiet,\nwell-spoken man who's title\nseems far too grand to sit\ncomfortably on his\nshoulders. Despite this he\nis a competent\nadministrator who has\nsuccessfully coordinated\ngeneral maintenance and\nthe recent major works\nsince his transfer from\nEstates to the new post in\nMay 1984. He describes his\nrole as 'providing a cost-effective service which will\nmaintain and improve the\ncurrent College residence\nstock to ensure residences\nare kept to a comfortable\nand reasonable standard\nfor the residents.'. Mr\nHallsworth also makes\ninspections of Head\nTenancies and with regard\nto Hamlet Gardens said\ntentatively 'We must\ncontinue to persuade the\nlandlords there to improve\neach year and upgrade\nthose properties as much\nas we can.'\nThree major renovation\nprojects began over the\nsummer, all under Mr\nHallsworths control.\nCompulsory repairs were\nmade to Willis Jackson\nHouse to bring it into line\nwith the Housing Acts and\nthese were completed just\nbefore the start of term. In\naddition to the legal\nrequirements three\nbathrooms were converted\ninto double showers and\nextensive areas of dry rot\nwere discovered and\nrepaired. This work in\nEvelyn Gdns is just the\nbeginning of a rolling\nprogramme, including the\ncurrent external repairs,\nwhich will see all the\nhouses upgraded by the\nend of 1987-88.\nImprovements were also\nmade to Montplelier over\nthe summer vacation\nincluding the complete\nrefurbishment of the top\nfloor. Asked for his\nopinions on the residences\nSecurity has long been a problem in Southside with\nthe doors fr que ntl y being\nwedged open or simply not\nlocking after people; 'Even\nwhen you have mechanical\nclosing systems they can\nbe wedged open. This puts\nextra strain on hinges and\nsprings which are\nfrequently readjusted.\nThere is no real answer\nother than people\nphysically closing doors\nbehind them.' Steps are\nbeing taken to improve the\nsituation; the Selkirk door\nhas already been changed\nand are improvements\nabout to be made at the\nWest end. Once the new\ndoors are all in place an\nelectro-magnetic locking\nsystem will be made\noperational on the second\ndoors to replace the old\nelectric bolt type. As Mr\nHallsworth frankly admits,\n'The 'Betalock' electric\nlatches fitted to the top of\nthe doors have proved to\nbe a complete failure.' He\nalso agreed that if this new\nlock was unsatisfactory the\nonly real answer would be\nto man both of the doors.\nOver the last vacation the\nHall laundries on Gallery\nLevels in Southside were\nremoved and this has led to\nmany complaints that the\ncentral la und re tte in the\nbasement cannot cope.\n'The central la und re tte was\ninstalled with a view to\nremoving Hall laundries\nfrom gallery levels so that\nkitchen facilities could be\nimproved. It was opened in\nMr Hallsworth said, '/ think\nsome of the Halls,\nparticularly Linstead and\n. Weeks, are of a very\nreasonable standard in\nboth accommodation and\nfacilities. Places like\nMontpelier do need a considerable amount of\nwork but we have started\nsome of that this year.'\nThe major concerns over\nSouthside are mainly the\nfire alarm, security and the\nlaundry facilities. While the\nfire alarm is not Mr\nHallsworth's direct concern\nhe said 'It is well known\nthat the fire alarm system is\nnot satisfactory in\nSouthside building and\nthere is no point denying\nthat fact. I know that\nMaintenance Services\nSection is actively engaged\nin solving the problems and\nI think it has improved in\nrecent months.'\nJune '84 and fitted out with\nequipment equal to that in\nthe Halls, 8 washing\nmachines and 4 tumble\ndryers. Knowing the Hall\nlaundries were to be taken\nout of use I have installed\nan extra tumble dryer, a spin dryer and a sink to\nupgrade the facilities. The\nusage is obviously very\ngreat and a number of\ncomplaints have been\nraised with regards to the\ninadequacy of the provision\nthere. With the new\nproposals to leave Selkirk\nand Tizzard kitchens on\ngallery level it may well be\npossible to bring the\nSelkirk laundry and drying\nroom back into use. This\nwill give extra facilities to\nthe 72 students in that Hall\nand ease the load on the\ncentral laundry.'\nMr Hallsworth was quick to\ndeny the allegation that\nHalls are receiving a disproportionate amount of\nthe funds available. While\nhe could not allow the\nHalls to deteriorate he\nenvisaged the majority of\nfunds available would be\nspent on the Houses. This\nis confirmed in the\nconclusions of his current\nreport to the Student\nResidence Cttee, 'During\nthe last financial year\npriority has been given to\nensuring that the main\nareas of neglected\nmaintenance and repairs to\nthe residence stock are\nattended to.... The priority\nalready given to improving\nthe standard of\naccommodation, facilities\nand equipment in Houses\nwill continue in the year\n1985/86.'\nThe impression given by Mr\nHallsworth is that of steady\nimprovement without\ncomplacency. Often fairly\nminor improvements, such\nas ensuring the windows\nare cleaned properly, are a major task. Though his\nbudget runs into tens of\nthousands of pounds, funds\nare still limited in a world\nwhere the estimated cost of\nelevator refurbishment in\nTizzard is \u00a365 000. Mr\nHallsworth does remain\noptimistic however, 'Over\nthe last 18 months I 've\nbeen particularly\nchallenged by a complex\nand difficult job, and on the\nwhole I 've received the\ncooperation and\nunderstanding of the vast\nmajority of people who\nhave a vested interest in\nstudent accommodation. I look forward to another\nyear where we can see a good measure of\nimprovement within the\nCollege residences.'\nFELIX Friday 1 November\n\n"

Suffering from\nthe loss, but more\ndetermined, IC continued\nto control the game. Ian\nParker finally converted a short corner leaving us 1-0\nup at half-time.\nBack up to 11 men after\nborrowing RCS's right\nwing, skills emerged which\nnobody thought existed\nand Ian Parker put another\ngoal home from a penalty\nflick after a scuffle around\nthe goal.\nSupport from the IC\nladies hockey team spurred\nthe team on, especially\nJohn Stonham who was\nseen in Sussex'sD and\nmanaged a shot,\nsubsequently saved and\nnudged home by Justin.\nAll I keep hearing is 'four\nwin's in a row \u2014 you're\nkidding'.\nSunbury 1 IC 2nd XI 1\nIC second XI recorded their\nfirst point of the season in\na closely contested 1-1\ndraw.

IC spent some\nconsiderable time\nentrenched in the wrong\nhalf with the opposition\nforcing a series of short\ncorners from which they\nwere unlucky not to score.\nIn the face of some\nadversity the seconds\nforced their way out of\ntheir half to create an\nenterprising attack\nculminating in some\nclinical finishing from Nick\nHope to gain the equalise r.

Sir Keith has\nadministered severe cuts in\nthe government's funding\nof universities. These cuts\nhave affected the quality of\nthe education you are\nreceiving. They have meant\nthat you have had to run up\nan overdraft so that you\ncan complete your studies.\nBritain needs high quality\ngraduates. The electronics\nindustry, for example, can\nnot get enough graduates.\nThe government has\ndecided to spend money on\ndefence rather than\neducation. This decision\nseems set to do\nincalculable damage to\nBritain's industry. It is vital\nthat we make our views\nknown when Sir Keith visits\nCollege. Join the Socsoc\npicket of the Great Hall.\nPlease make the picket\npeaceful, though. It\nseriously damages\nstudents' interests if they\nare seen on TV throwing\neggs at government\nministers.

If you\nare a Union officer who is\ngoing to the event, may I suggest you make a donation to cover the cost\nof the food and drink you\nconsume, this way you can\ninfluence College and ,i ave a good time without\ncosting the Union anything.\nThe Union is short of\nmoney.

It is difficult\nto know what to think. Mr\nSmith and Mr Northey\nseem to be desperate to get\nrid of the bar. The\nappointment of Mr McVey\nas a Bar Manager can only\nhave been a short term\nmove by College. Mr\nMcVey was unhelpful and\ninexperienced.\nUntil recently it seemed\nlikely that we would have to\ntrade part of the Union\nBuilding for the Bar. The\nlatest document seems to\nsuggest that we should be\ngiven the Bar for free. The\nUnion must ask why\nCollege plans to give away\na bar that apparently makes\nlots of money.\nCollege claim that they\nare transferring control to\nimprove efficiency. If this is\nthe case, the Union must\ndo its best to get a good\ndeal from College. The\nnegotiations about the Bar\ncould be used to the\nUnion's benefit. The\ndiscussion document\nsuggests that the Union\nshould be given a separate\nlegal identity (at present\nthe Union cannot be\nprosecuted, it is regarded\nas part of College). If the\nUnion does become a seperate legal body, it\nshould consider asking for\nownership of the north side\nof Beit. This would mean\nthat Life Sci could not\nattempt to take over the\nUnion Building. I realise\nthat given the current\nfinancial climate this\nunlikely. It does no harm to\nask, though.\nNobody, though, seems\nto have considered the\npossibility that the College\nwant to get rid of the Bar\nfor a specific reason.

    "content": "Another Barman\nBites The Dust\nUnion barman Tony McVey was\nsacked by refectory manager\nRob Northey on Monday, after\nthe bar failed to open on\nSaturday night. Mr McVey's dismissal comes only four\nweeks after the controversial\nresignations of former bar\nmanager Doug Armstrong and\nbarman Brian Ellison.\nMr McVey did not arrive to\nopen the Union bar on Saturday\nevening, and the casual staff\nwere unable to contact either\nMr Northey, who was away for\nthe weekend, or barman Dave\nBrennan, each of whom has a set of keys. The bar remained\nclosed all evening and both the\nstaff and the weekend\ncustomers went over to\nSouthside bar. The bar was\nopen as usual on Sunday.\nMr McVey had been working\nat IC for only five weeks when\nhe was transfered to the Union\nbar from a job in the refectories.\nWhen he made the\nappointment, Mr Northey was\nconfident that Mr McVey had\nthe necessary experience to run\na bar. He told FELIX on\nTuesday that he would not be\nappointing are plac ment bar\nmanager, since the future of the\nbar was still uncertain owing to\nthe plans for a Union takeover.\nHe felt that it would be unfair to\nmake a new a ppp ointment when\ncontrol of the bar might very\nshortly be changing hands, and\nadded that for the moment the\nbar would be run on a day to\nday basis.\nMr McVey is now working in a pub in Woolwich, where he was\ncontacted by FELIX on\nWednesday evening. He said\nthat he was unable to open the\nUnion bar on Saturday night as\nhe was ill with a form of food\npoisoning. He had asked a friend to try and contact Mr\nNorthey or assistant refectory\nmanager Martin Parsons on his\nbehalf but he had been unable\nto do so. Mr McVey denied the\nsuggestion that he had been\noffered his present job last\nweek. He said that he had rung\nthe pub on Monday, following\nhis dismissal, and had been\noffered the job from that\nevening. He declined to make\nany comment on Mr Northey's running of the bars.\nMr Northey said on Thursday\nthat he had taken 'everything\ninto consideration' when\nmaking the decision to dismiss\nMr Mc'v 'ey, but fe it that more\neffort could have been made to\nget the keys to the bar.\nMr Northey stood by his\noriginal decision to appoint a barman from the refectory staff,\nrather than to advertise the\nvacancy. He said that it was far\nbetter to give the job to\nsomeone he knew, particularly\nin view of the short term nature\nof the appointment. He admitted\nthat he had been more aware of\nthe possibility of a Union\ntakeover of the Bar than he had\nbeen prepared to admit at the\ntime.\nGoing\nUnderground\nCity and Guilds Union held a UGM with a difference on\nMonday afternoon. Due to an\nerror over room bookings Mech\nEng 220 was not available, so\nthe meeting was held on the\nLondon Underground. Guilds\nPresident Roger Preece opened\nthe meeting on the westbound\nplatform of South Kensington\nStation with his own report.\nAfter the first adjournment, the\nremaining reports were read,\nbut not necessarily heard, on\nthe second carriage of a circle\nline tube. Elections for various\nposts were then held before the\nsecond adjournment at Baker\nStreet. Despite frequent appeals\nover the station t annoys y tem, the meeting continued on the\nplatform with the remaining\nelections, and closed with a resounding 'Boomalaka'.\nA Walk In The Park\nSixty IC students took part in\nthe Campaign for Nuclear\nDisarmament demonstration last\nSaturday. The 'Rally for the\nHuman Race', attended by\naround 100,000 people, was the\nlargest CND demonstration in\nLondon for two years. ICCND\ntook the chance to publicise the\narrival of SDI 'Star Wars'\nresearch at Imperial College. IC\nSocialist Society and members\nof Imperial's trade union\nbranches were also on the\nmarch.\nThe demonstration began\nwith a circular march from Hyde\nPark, taking in both the US and\nSoviet embassies. The marchers\ntook part in a four minute 'die-in' and a four minute sit-down\nprotest along the way. On\ncompleting the route, protesters\nformed a giant CND symbol in\nthe park.\nThe success of the\ndemonstration will be seen as a boost to CND, both nationally\nand at college level. After a year\nin the shadow of other popular\nmovements such as Live Aid,\nthe debate on SDI is bringing\nthe nuclear issue back into the\npublic eye.\nFree Friday 1 November No 719\n\n"

They urge the Government to\nfollow suit.\nIn defending their\nopinions, the academics\nhave expressed concern\nthat SDI will divert\nresources away from the\nrejuvenation of British\nindustry, and that it could\nlead to a new 'Star Wars'\narms race between East\nand West. The petitions\nrefer to a set of papers by\nProfessor David Parnas, an\nex-member of the SDI\npanel on 'Computing in\nSupport of Battle\nManagement'. Professor\nParnas' report claim that\nSDI is not only unreliable\nand un trust wort y, but is an\nimpossible task to realise.\nProfessor Manny\nLehman, the IC Academic\nwhose research contract\nsparked off the\ncontroversy, told FELIX\nthat his views do not differ\ngreatly from those of his\ncolleagues. Reiterating his\nbelief that the research will\nprovide scientific proof\ndetrimental to the future of\nSDI, Professor Lehman\nstated that his work was\nnot specifically on SDI, and\nthat ignorance of software\ntechnology was a greater\nthreat to mankind than the\nnuclear arms race.\nHead of Department,\nBruce Sayers told FELIX\nthat he didn't support SDI\nbecause it diverted\nresources away from the\nAlvey resource work which\nin his view is more\nimportant to the UK.\nOn Thursday, STOIC\norganised a debate\nbetween Professors\nLehman and Kowalski.\nProfessor Lehman stressed\nagain that he was not\nbuilding components of the\n'Star Wars' system. His\ncontract was to investigate\nthe software technology\nnecessary for such a programme . He was\nadamant that the system\nwas not viable, saying that\n'Software of the size and\ncomplexity necessary to\nachieve the SDI target\nclearly can not be built'.\nProfessor Lehman also\naired his views on 'software\nPollution' claiming that\nerrors in software that did\nnot show up until program\nexecution are potentially\nthe most dangerous part of\nthe system.\nProfessor Kowalski was\nconcerned that SDI will\ntake funds away from\neconomically useful\nresearch. He also said that\nthe result of investigative\nstudies of SDI should make\nthe political leadership of\nthe world realise that it is\nimpossible, but these\nresults could be dismissed\nas motivated by left wing\npolitics.\nTrue Grit\nProposals to extract a layer\nof gravel from beneath the\nIC playing field at\nHarlington are to be\nimplemented when\nplanning permission is\nobtained. Henry Streeter\n(Sand and Ballast) Ltd, the\ncompany which has been\nmining the gravel on a site\nadjacent to the playing\nfields, has accepted a tender from College to\ncarry out the work.\nThe Union is arranging a meeting with College to\ndiscuss the matter. ACC chairman Simon Errington\nis concerned that there will\nnot be suffice nt space\nremaining for IC sports\nclubs once the work\nbegins.\nReeves Flushed\nCollege Security Officer,\nGeoff Reeves, confirmed\nthis week that he had been\nsoaked. In his weekly\nbulletin on the soaking\nsituation, Mr Reeves said\nthat \u00a350 of clothing had\nbeen damaged by the\nSoaker and that he would\nmake the Soaker replace\nthe clothing when he\ncaught him. Mr Reeves has\nset up a so aker hotline on\n3371.\nBreakfast In Beit\nA group of QT members appeared outside the Union\nbuilding to eat breakfast yesterday lunchtime. To avoid\nbeing recognised they wore pyjamas, dressing-gowns,\nslippers and sunglasses (a QT trademark). While reading\nthe morning papers they ate cornflakes, followed by coffee\nand biscuits.\nA QT Spokesman contacted FELIX later, 'claiming\nirresponsibility for the event'. He said an Annual Dinner\nwas too expensive nowadays and this event provided good\nvalue at a fraction of the cost. He went on to warn of the\ndanger of jumping in front of fast cars. He said that the\nUGM on Tuesday could be a possible target for a QT\nActive Service Unit.\nData\nProtection\nExamination marks will\nhave to be disclosed to\nstudents as a result of the\nimplementation of the data\nprotection Act in 1987.\nThe current practice is to\nnotify the result (ie pass or\nfail) of an exam, sometimes\nwith a grade. Present\nUniversity of London\nregulations prohibit the\ndisclosure of actual marks\nto students. The new Act is\nforcing a change in these\nrules, although no change\nwill take place for exams\nheld in 1986.\nThe University's Academic Council is\nsuggesting that all exam\nmarks should be notified to\nindividual students as a matter of course. However,\nthe College's Board of\nStudies, meeting on\nWednesday, refused to\nsupport this view despite\npressure from student\nrepresentatives. The\nCollege wants to meet the\nminimum requirement of\nthe Act, and only disclose\nexam marks to students\nwho specifically request\nthem. This view will be put\nto the University, which will\nfinally decide the\nprocedure to be adopted.\nIf the College's view\nprevails it has been pointed\nout that if only a small\nproportion of the 4800\nstudents at IC write to the\nRegistry to find out their\nmarks this will create an\nenormous administrative\nwork-load. Union President\nCarl Burgess said he hopes\nthe Union will encourage\nstudents to make such\nenquiries with a view to\nforcing the College to\nreveal marks to everyone\nautomatically.\nColditz\nMajor Patrick Ried MBE\ngave a Wellsoc lecture to a nearly full physics lecture\ntheatre on Monday evening.\nMajor Ried was imprisoned\nin Colditz castle for two\nyears and escaped in 1942.\nHe spent an hour retelling\nstories of his days at the\nGerman prisoner of war\ncamp for dedicated escape\nartists. His anecdotes were\nentertaining and frequently\nstirred the audience to\nlaughter.\nMajor Ried's experiences,\nand those of his fellow\nprisoners, have been made\ninto a film and a television\nseries. He has also written\nthree books on the subject.\n16 \u2022Friday 1 November FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Home News\nDear Hugh,\nOver the past two weeks I have read, with no great\nsurprise, your stories about\nthe troubles Selkirk and\nTizard are suffering as a result of modification to\nSouthside. I was a resident\nin Tizard Hall for two years,\none as a re-app, and served\non the Hall Committe for\nmost of that time. It was\ntherefore with some\nsurprise that I learnt of the\nforthcoming work over the\nsummer. No mention of this\nhad been made in hall\ncommittee meetings. There\nwas no consultation on the\nsubject, no chance to air\nthe views of the people\nwho actually live there, not\neven formal notification\nbefore the end of term. The\nfirst any Tizard Hail official\nknew (warden included, i believe) was when the\nassistant sub warden got\nback from holiday and was\ntold by the housekeeper\nthat 'work starts in two\nweeks'!\nBeing somewhat\nconcerned about this rather\nunsatisfactory state of\naffairs, I went and so oke to\nDave Kingston and Carl\nBurgess during the\nholidays to find out if the\nrumours I had heard were\ntrue. Unfortunately they\nwere. The plans seemed t) have been slipped th rou gi, in the interregnum period\nas last year's exec moved\nout and this year's moved\nin. The current exec was\napparently told what was\nhappening, saw no reason\nto complain or even to tell\nthe Southside people what\nwas going on, and\ncontinued merrily on their\nway. They didn't even seem\nto accept that a different\nplan was possible, though\nnow Carl seems to accept\nnot only the pos sib lit y but\nthe need for 'different\nplans'.\nThey even had the gall to\nsuggest that the ICU exec\nknew more about what\nliving in Southside is about\nthan the hall committees.\nCome on, you people\nwere elected by us to\nrepresent us not to help the\nManaging Surveyor\n(Residences) in trying to\npush through plans that\nwill wreck hall social life\n(which might have been the\nidea in the first place). The\nhall committee wouldn't have had to produce a petition if you'd done your\njob properly.\nYours annoyed ly Dave Clements\nPhysics 3\nGreat Bores\nToday\nof\nArts\nDear Editor,\nWhilst I appreciate your\ninclusion of arts reviews in\nFELIX, can I draw your\nattention to the lack of vital\ninformation in the 'Bloody\nFunny' review. There was\nno mention of where the\nshow was pia ying, not even\nthe title of Ms Ingleton's comedy. Wishing to share\nthe joke I managed to\ndiscover that it was at the\nICA until Saturday 19\nOctober and it was entitled\n'Strip Jack Naked'.\nLet's hope this attempt to\npromote culture in IC\ncontinues, but that reviews\nare more helpful in future.\nYours disappointed ly Marion Cook\nMat Tech 2\nEditors Note: I must\napologise.

If anyone wants to\nhelp with proof reading\nthey will be more than\nwelcome in the FELIX\noffice.\nPolitics\nDear Sir,\nI should like to reply to S Dunlop's letter of last week\nconcerning Southern\nAfrica,\nThe African National\nCongress (ANC) is a communist front\norganisation in South\nAfrica aided by military\nlinks with the PLO and\nSWAPO, with the aim of\noverthrowing, by violent\nand bloody means, the\ngovernment of S Africa.\nGromyko, in his recent\npublications on S Africa\nnas frequently\ncongratulated the 'fine\nwork' done by the ANC and\nclearly sets out how to use\n'military force' so that when\nin power they can demand\na 'monopoly of power' ie\ndictatorship. Recent\nevidence has shown the\nANC seek power not peace,\ndomination not freedom.\nWe must work toward\nchange in the present\nsystem not by violent\nstruggle but through\ndemocratic processes. That\nis what I believe State\nPresident Botha is trying to\nachieve and why I support\nhis measures of reform.\nGraham Brown\nDear Hugh,\nAt the risk of becoming\nknown as 'notorious\ncollege bore' Mike Jones\nhere's another letter for\nVC J \u2014 maybe if you think it\nmerits a full page article\nplease go ahead and\npublish! What follows is the\nentire text of a letter written\nto me personally from\nnotorious college bore\nMike Newman plus my\ncomments and replies. As\nyou will see I have\nODviously stirred up a bit of\na hornet's nest inside Mr\ni Mew man's mind.\nDear Mike Jones,\nHaving read your letter I was very confused. Firstly\nyour original letter was an\nattack on me not my\narguments. I felt the tone of\nthis first letter and\npresumably the reasons for\nwriting it, were not those of\nsomeone condemning\nRSMU and its support of\nevents showing hard-core\npornography. I have no\nidea what your views are\non nuclear warfare, human\nrights, sexism and porn, all\n' know is your letter\nattempted to question my\nsincerity over all these\nissues. If as you say in your\nsecond letter you hold\nsimilar ideals to me it\nappears you are not willing\nto act on them, and indeed\nwould rather attack people\n'ho are doing something.\nAs I say in my second\n's tter it is the way that\n-hose people are going\nabout doing something that\nquite frankly gets on my\ntits rather than the ideals\nconcerned\u2014more about my\nmethod at a future\ndate\u2014groans of boredom\nfrom the silent majority at\nIC. Back to M Newman's letter.\nYour whole ignorance on\nthe matter of the issue you\nwrite about is unbelievable.\nAn 'anti-porn' motion was\nput to an IC UGM in 1983-34, RSMU cleverly\nprevented it being debated\nat the first UGM (does\nanyone else remember the\namendment trump card!)\nAt the next one it was\ndebated for the first time,\nand was passed despite t ne futile efforts of Chris\nCrownshaw exhibiting his\nusual respect for\ndemocracy cy walking out\ntrying to create in quo racy. Indeed it was quite a sight\nthese chickens running!\nPresumably you would\nhave enjoyed it as much as\nme as we hold similar\nideals, (cont on page 94)\n\u2022L10 loin the\nWorldbeaters\nFlights\u2022Trains \u2022Tours \u2022Accommodation SkiHolidays\u2022 ISISInsurance\u2022 \\S\\ CCard\n^ GroupRates \u2022Weekend Breaks ULU Travel\nImperial College, The Junior Common Room,\nSherfield Building, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7. 01-581 8882\nA Service of\nSTA\nTheWorldbeaters\nAHO\nGOVERNMENT BONDED UNDER A TO L822 IN ASSOCIATION WITH SATA C CHARTER ERS FELIX Friday 1 November 14\n\n"

    "content": "Floods, and the destruction\nthey can cause, pose a major threat to built-up\nareas in the vicinity of\nrivers and estuaries. In\nthese areas flood-gates are\nsometimes used as part of\nflood protection schemes\nto control storm and tidal\nsurges, and so reduce\npotential risk to life and\nproperty. Dr D Hardwick,\nfrom the Civil Engineering\nDepartment, has been\ninvolved with the testing of\npossible flood-gate designs\nfor a number of major\nprotection schemes,\nincluding the Thames\nBarrier Project.\nFlood-gates have to be\nFLOODS\nAn in-depth study by FELIX Science Editor Debbie\nWilkes\nFig. 1\ntailored to meet the needs\nof each individual area.\nBecause of this predict on of how they will perform is\noften difficult, especially if\nthey have unusual duties,\nor complex structural\nfeatures. A major problem\nis that turbulence in the\nsurrounding water flow can\ninitiate vibrations in the\nstructure that ultimately\nlead to structural fatigue or\neven spectacular\nresonance. By building\nrealistic small scale models\nit is possible to investigate\nthe suitability of floodgates\nof novel design under\nfuture operating conditons\nand ensure that they won't suffer vibration induced\ndamage. Dr Hardwick's group test designs by\nconstructing small scale\nmodels that are inexpensive\nyet yield a great deal of\nvaluable information.\nThe Thames Barrier\nProject is probably the\nmost well known flood\nprotection scheme that the\ngroup have worked on.\nThey were involved at an\nearly stage, working with\nthe consultants Rendel,\nPalmer and Tritton, looking\ninto the basic design and\nways to improve it. Later on\nthey worked with the\ncontractors studying the\nfeasibility of getting the\ngates into position by\nfloating them in on a falling\ntide. The barrier has a design life of eighty years,\nbut it will be effective for\nfar longer. During this time\nit will be used initially only\nonce or twice a year, with a really disastrous flood\nlikely to occur once every\ntwenty years. Without such\na barrier the threat to\nLondon would be\nintolerable.\nOn the strength of their\nexperience with the\nThames Barrier, Dr\nHardwick's group were\nasked to test a possible\ndesign for the proposed\nScheldt barrier at Antwerp.\nThe city of Antwerp, on the\nRiver Scheldt, is\nincreasingly threatened\nwith flooding, as a result of\nstorm surges from the\nNorth Sea. In 1980 it was\nproposed that a flood\nbarrier, similar in function\nto the Thames barrier,\nshould be built just down\nriver from the city. The\ngroup were asked to carry\nout vibration studies on a possible configuration put\nforward by the designers\nJoint Venture SVKS of\nBrussells. The design\nconsisted of 3 80 metre\nspan drop gates spann ng the busy navigation\nchannel, but stored high\nup, allowing traffic to pass\nbeneath; in the event of a flood warning these gates\nwould drop down blocking\noff the channel. These were\nflanked on either side by 50\nmetre span radial gates\nreaching to the margins of\nthe es tura ry. Physical\nmodels , such as the one of\nthe radial gate shown in fig\n1 were constructed, which\nreproduced to scale the\nmain geometric and\ndynamic features of the\nproposed gates. Studies\nusing the models showed\nthat the radial gates had\nexcellent stability, but that\nthe drop gates should be\nclosed and locked well in\nadvance of the approaching\nsurge if serious vibrational\nproblems were to be\nFig. 3\navoided. The design study\nhas been completed but\nsevere financial constraints\nhave delayed\nimplementation.\nOn a more modest scale,\nthe North West Water\nAuthority are at present\nconstructing a scheme\nwhich will reduce the risk\nof flooding on the River\nWye at Garstang, between\nLancaster and Preston.\nThis scheme is shown in\nFig 2; at the approach of a storm surge the pair of\ngates, which normally rest\non the river bed, are\nautomatically raised\ncausing water to be\ntemporarily stored on the\nflood plain up steam of the\ngates. This water would\notherwise flood the built-up\narea which is down steam. The group were asked, by\nthe designers Messrs Rofe,\nKennard and Lapworth, to\nprovide information on the\nwater levels once the new\nsystem was installed, and\nthe effect it would have on i an ex i siting pump intake\njust downstream. The\nmodel that they\nconstructed, shown in Fig\n3, was inexpensive to build j and gave speedy and\nsatisfactory results.\nThe use of small scale\nmodels can be very\neffective, as it allows\nresearchers to gain\nvaluable information about\nhow new flood-gate\ndesigns will perform, and\nhow to modify proposed\ndesigns. In the case of\ntotally new designs models j may be the only source of\ninformation. Without well\ndesigned flood protection\nschemes there is an\nunacceptably large risk to\nlife and property in many\nareas.\nFig. 2\nFELIX Friday 1 November 7\n\n"
