He\nwent on to say that from \"internal\nenquiries\" that the footballers had\nmade, it was not clear that 1CU AFC had been unambiguously resp on si ble. The Hammy Ten, he told Felix,\nattracted other people from outside the club such as \"girlfriends,\nflat mates and friends.\" Mr Dunsby,\na third year maths student, reported that the group was \"loud and\ndrunk... high-spirited and singing.\nKids and beer, they just don't mix.\"\nWhen asked about the damage, he\nsaid that they had gone to apologise to two of the pubs that had\ncomplained to ICU.\nIn a written statement to ICU\nCouncil, the outgoing Union\nPresident Eric Allsop said that \"the\nUnion disciplinary committee was\nnot well placed to deal with the\ntrue nature of the crime (ie not just\nbring the Union into disrepute but\nthe College as well) and [have]\npassed the issue up to the College\ndisciplinary.\"\nCollege Tutor, Dr Gareth Jones,\nsaid \"it's very bad and has certainly harmed the College... the\nCollege takes a serious view....I am\ngoing to visit the pubs and find out\nfirst hand from the publicans.\nThese pubs now have a very bad\nopinion of IC students and it will\ntake some time to correct that.\"\nHe said that the football club are\nvery reluctant to reveal identities\nand it will be difficult to take to a disciplinary. He declined to speculate on the outcome of the College\ninquiries.\nThe enquiry was underway as\nFelix was going to press.\nMedics Miffed by Rec\nRoom Bill\nJITEN PATH\nThe St Mary's Union (ICSMSU)\nhas been hit for the first time\nwith un for seen costs amounting\nto \u00a330,000, their bill for the use\nof the Recreation Centre in\nWilson House.\nThe Centre provides sports\nfacilities for all the clubs and societies within Imperial College,\nalthough the amenities are predominately used by those in the St\nMary's Medical School.\nUntil this year, all costs for use\nof the Centre by the medics have\nbeen met by the St Mary's Finance\nDepartment. A recent reassessment of this policy has meant that\nthe \u00a330,000 fee would be transferred to the ICSMSU. This left the\nUnion with an overspend of\n\u00a325,000 on top of their \u00a343,000\nbudget, which has been covered by\nthe St Mary's Finance Department.\nIn order to cover this year's costs,\nKatie Armstrong, the 1CS MSU President has requested an extra\n\u00a325,000 to be earmarked.\nIt has not yet been made clear\nas to how the situation will be han-d led, although Ms Armstrong, said\nthat Tim Clarke, Pro Rector, was\n\"being absolutely fantastic\" in easing the situation. Final decisions\nhave yet to be made as to how the\nfacilities will be charged for in\nfuture years but Mike Hansen,\nDirector of Finance, said that \"decisions will not be made until\nFebruary\" but \"the Union cannot be\nexpected to pay all the charges\nbeing made.\"\nImperial College Union's Indian\nSociety staged its annual\ncultural festival on Wednesday\nnight to an 800 strong crowd in\nthe Great Hall, writes fit en Patel.\nThe act which appeared to steal\nthe show was, ironically, a student from Queen Mary &. Westfield College who performed a dance routine to Michael\nJackson's \"Who is it?\"\nA fashion show followed (photo\nat right) with traditional and\nwestern clothes being worn by\nstudents from Imperial College.\nThe clothes were provided by\nVenisons, Raymonds and\nCiro Citerio.\nReactions to the event were universally positive. One student\ncommented that it was \"fanta s tic and even better than last year.\"\nPhoto: Virginia\nBYANDY SINHARAY\nThe traditional Imperial College\nUnion Rag Week may have 'died a death', it emerged this week.\nFelix has learned that Rag Week\nground to a halt due to what\nappears to have been a lack of\norganisation. Last week's Royal\nCollege of Science Union Beer\nFestival was intended to have\nmarked the beginning of Rag\nWeek.\nThe events were to include the\nC&.G Union Slave Auction, the\nSponsored Nude Kamikaze Parachute Jump (which abandoned due\nto an apparent lack of participants)\nculminating with Firewalking, which\nwas also cancelled. Rob Park, the\nex-RCSU vice-president who ran\nthe Beer Festival, said \"personally, 1\ndon't think they got organised...\nthere was a lack of communication\nover the summer.\" The Beer\nFestival, which took place in the\njunior Common Room on\nWednesday 12, was organised by\nthe RCSU Rag staff, who are separate from those at ICU.\nOutgoing ICU President, Eric\nAllsop, told Felix that the week \"may\nhave died a death through a lack of\norganisation.\" He also thought that\nit was possible that other factors\ncould be to blame such as the\nevents not seeming relevant to\ntoday's students, in addition to\npoor publicity. \"It only dawned on\nme that it was Rag Week when I heard of the Beer Festival,\" he said,\nadding that ultimately the charities\nIC supports would stand to lose the\nmost, and that ICU Rag would be\nshamed by the larger Rag collections of St Mary's and Charing Cross\nMedical Schools.\nThe ICU Rag Chair, Louise\nChoo, was not available for\ncomment.\n\n"

Paul Oakenfold, starts\noff with the laid back tr an cy number Mystery Land by Y Traxx, then\nJay Dee's Plastic Dreams rolls nicely into the dreamy Remember, by\nB.T. Next drops Energy 52's Cafe\nDel Mar, nice dreamy breaks and\ndriven beats, then the pace is lifted\nwith Nightmare by Brianbug one of\nmy favourites of the moment, massive tune. Keeping things rolling\nalong nicely with Oakenfold's mix\nof Olive's You're Not Alone, BBE's Flash then in comes D.J Scot\nProject's How Deep Is Your Love, a very slightly dod gy mix quickly sorted out. Yes even Oakenfold is not\nperfect, well not all the time.) This\ntrack has a slightly harder feel to it,\npicking up the pace again with its\nsoft techno sounds. This harder\nfeel is kept going until Marmion's Schoenberg is dropped from the\ntop, still with those harder beats.\nFinally and surprisingly started from\nthe beginning again, is Transa's Prophase in that hard trance y style.\nOver all as you would expect from\nsuch a quality DJ you're taken on a pleasant journey gradually building\nin pace as it progresses. I did\nexpect more involved mixing, but it\nis all kept neat and simple. 1\nassume to appeal to a wider audi-en ce. CD02. Nick Warren. This one\nstarts off with what you should all\nknow, Ultra Nate's Free, the former\nnumber 1, then it gets a little less\ncommercial with Alex Neri's Planet\nFunk 2 and the Heartist's Belo\nHorizonti before the wicked 187\nLockdown's Gunman is dropped in.\nThings are kept going with the\nequally good Ajare from Way Out\nWest (incidentally Nick Warren is\npart of Way Out West.) Then with a flick of the wrist the mood is totally changed and The Prodigy's Breathe comes tearing at you. Then\na quite superb mix of this into JDS's Nineways, then the tempo slowly\nbuilds from these break beat driven\ntracks to more rolling tr an cy house\ntunes such as Underworld's Cow\nGirl, Moon Man's Don't Be Afraid\nand Chicane's Offshore. Then for\nsome reason which I could not\nunderstand Stretch &. Vern's cheese-ta stic Get Up is brought in,\ntotally killing any vibe that had been\ngot going then the equally weak\nDario G Sunchyme is dropped in. It\nfinishes with the excellent\nChemicals Brothers' Block Rockin'\nBeats.\nOverall these CDs give a comprehensive review of the current\n'club scene' from cheese y chart\ntoppers to underground classics. I preferred the Oakenfold CD due to\nit being more of a journey and no\ncheese fillers. The Warren CD\nwould have been so much better if\nhe had left out the commercial\nstuff, because the change of styles\nfrom break beat to house was quite\nsuperb. But I prefer my music harder and on the more underground\ntip. These CD's seem to be aimed\nat a broader audience, not one for\nthe hardcore. ITTcl\nMP\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nBig Bud - Rafiki / Memories kkk k( Creative Source 015)\nI could not decide which of these tracks was the\nA side due to them both being equally strong\ntracks. Keeping with Creative Source's intelligent more musical stepping style of D&B, but\nwith a definite air of originality. Memories starts\noff with a stepping break beat, then rolls in with\nstrong atmospheric als and ab-line. Rafiki is in\nmuch the same style with very deep and haunting feel with echoing beats. Top quality production as you would expect. If anyone thinks D&B is not a form of music, just samples and big b lines they should give this a listen and they\nmight learn something.\nD.J Suv - free beat EP (double vinyl) kkk k( Full Cycle Rec)\nD.J Suv, the least known of the Full Cycle col-lect ive, offers us a4 track EP for his debut solo\nproject. And what a way to start - if he keeps\ngoing like this he won't be the least known for\nlong. All four tracks are absolutely firing, pack\nfull of fresh ideas and originality with that distinctive Full Cycle feel. Fat b lines, stepping\nbeats 'n' breaks, clever arrangements, dark\nsamples and excellent use of a piecing piano\ntone in 'Output'. Everything you would expect\nfrom this label , still leading the way after many\nyears at the front. Setting a trend that so many\nother's will follow. MP\nLA Synthesis - Harmonic Disassembly\nUniversal Language - Released 01/12/97\nHarmonic Disassembly is the trio's first release\nfor the famous Universal Language label (also\nhome to the very funky Jedi Knights). The title\ntrack is an awesome trip into old skool electro;\ncomplete with authentic robotic voices, funky\nrhythms and a vibrant string section. Skyline is a straight 4/4 effort, blending technology with\ndeep harmonies. This falls into the groovy deep\nhouse cat a gory. Look out for this EP!\nHonesty - Weitzeituhr\nSonic Icons - Out now\nGerman electronic music continues to soar to\nnew heights. This 10\" EP on a new Berlin label is\nbest classed as completely freestyle; juggling\nmoody ambient synth melodies with unconventional rhythm patterns and extremely funky\nbasslines. Da Doub lies somewhere between\nelectro and and jazz. Acapulco Gold would glide\neffortlessly into the midst of any Detroit techno\nset. Both mixes of Cote d'l voire are examples of\ncutting-edge dance music with a groove.\nComputers ain't funky? Don't believe it!\nAlick\nFull Intention - (I love) America. Remixes\nkkk( Stress Rec.)\nStress have re-issued the 96' classic America\nwith a shed load of new remixes, from the likes\nof Sharp, Gant, Todd Terry, Jean &. Peran, UBQ\n&. Jason Nevins. So there should be something\nfor everyone here from gay disco style mixes to\nthe fat 'speed garage' mix of Gant and a more\nbanging mix by Sharp. These are all top quality\ntracks in there own right and very different from\neach other, except for the title sample which is\nthe only thing that lets these tunes down. It\nbecomes a bit annoying after a while, well it did\nfor me after repeated listening of all eight re-mixes. But the strength of the re-mixes, makes\nit a useful addition to any record collection. A nice diverse selection of mixes from some of\nthe best re-mixers in the business. Worth a lis-ten.\nLucid - / Can't Help Myself kkk\n(Delirous)\nThis is Lucid's debut single and it's not bad at\nall. There's four mixes to choose from, all have\nthat hard house feel to them in varying degrees.\nWith driven beats and b line, with those dreamy\ntitle vocals from Clare Canty in a folk style.\nThere's nothing part icu aly special about this\ntrack, but there's also nothing wrong with it.\n\n"

The stereotypical skinhead yo b is actually not\nthe spiritual leader of England's army of lager louts, but rather a tuneful, music maestro. The evidence for this bizarre statement\nlies on his CV. Just underneath the\nprevious bands section you can\nfind listed The Happy Mondays.\nAnyone who doesn't recall the\npopularity of the phrase 'You're\ntwist in' my melon, man' is either\ntoo young or was utterly oblivious\nto what was happening during the\nearly 90's. As you're no doubt\naware, this featured the vocal talents of the aforementioned yo b, Mr. Ryder.\nUnfortunately all good things\ncome to an end, so inviting some\nof his mates (and some members\nof the Mondays for good measure)\nShaun grouped together another\nensemble and from the ashes of\nthe Mondays rose Black Grape.\nTheir first album it's Great when\nYou're Straight...Yeah! went down a storm as the guys themselves were\ncausing a storm on and off camera.\nShaun's confession to going to the\nHacienda in his younger days just\nto steal women's handbags didn't exactly aid Black Grape's appeal to\na wider audience. Mind you people\nwho are easily offended please\nnote - this album doesn't hold\nback.\nCommencing with Ronald and\nNancy Reagan's confessions to\ndrug addiction. Get Higher starts\nthe album as it means to go on, the\nstyle of the album being similar to\ntheir first. For the uninitiated this\nentails lots of shouting and swearing (often at the same time!) laced\nover some damn fine tunes. Make\nno mistake, you will be singing\nalong to the an the mic melody\nlines, that scream out with energy\nusually found in dex tro l tablets.\nDadi was a Badi stands out, with\nlyrics that home in on the band's life growing up in and around\nManchester, and Money Back\nGuaranteed gets a mention simply\nfor pure quality. These two are definite future single contenders.\nAll in all a very listenable album\nto get the old blood circulating as\nthe cold nights draw in. Black\nGrape aren't going to win awards\nfor the profound ness of their lyrics,\nbut thumping out stuff to keep the\npunters happy doesn't seem to do\nOasis any harm. In short, buy this\nalbum, but don't play it to your\nparents.\nElliot\nCOMPETITION\nT SHIRTS TO BE\nHAD!!\nThere are a couple of T shirt\ncompetitions this week.\nThe Wildhearts\nand Moby (seen\nmodelling said Tshirt) have both generously sent a few Tshirts down to Felix\nas giveaways. All you\nhave to do, is to\nanswer the two\nrespective questions\nto win either Tshirt.\nHere goes then...\nWildhearts Question:\nWhat is the name of the band\nthat two former members of\nthe Wildhearts left to form?\nMoby Question:\nWhat is Moby's name?\noriginal first\nYou can drop your entries in to\nthe Felix office, located in the left\nhand corner of the Union build-ing.\nSINGLES\nNaughty By Nature - Mourn You Til I join You\nSuperior hip-hop from one of the most consistent outfits in the last ten years. Notably slick,\ngreat rhymes; this is modern r'n' b at its best. A live version of the Nothing To Lose soundtrack\ntitle track is even better than the a side with\noodles of their deliberate swagger and bass lines\nthat hit you right in the stomach.\nYo La Tengo - Little Honda\nThe hushed vocals and the steady riff remind\nme of The Jesus and Mary Chain circa. The\nSound of Speed, but the gentle lyrical humour\nlifts it to the standard you'd expect from\nMatador Records. The true talent of the band is\nglimpsed in the depth and quality of the b sides,\nall of which are absolute blinders.\nQueen Latifa - It's Alright\n'When I'm sexing you, when I'm next to you,\nthen I know it's alright'. Piss off, will you? Why\ndo all these records sound the same? Expertly\nput together, wonderfully sung, produced to\ndeath and an absolute waste of time.\nNovacaine - Pond Life\nVery average, plodding middle-of-the-road\nAmerican dull-rock. You can tell that they are\nreally trying very hard to be taken seriously, but\nyou get the feeling from this record that the\nform has already been exhausted, which is a very harsh thing to say about any record.\n| THE ESSENTIAL CHOON Finley Quaye - It's Great When We're Together\nBrimming over with groove, with an unforgettable hook and as funky an arrangement of\nstrings, hammond organ, drums and bass as you\ncould wish for, this ultra laid back number has\nthe same feel as Lovely Day and has instant\nclassic written all over it.\nLife of Agony - Desire\nTerribly serious, moody, kind of Seal meets\nMetallica ballad. 'Uncomfortable, feeling miser-able, and I never want to change'; how many\npubescent rock outfits have thrown that lyric\nout? Competent enough, but not very interest-ing. That's it really.\nGlobal Communication - The Groove\nSearing trumpet and fluid percussion give out to\na magic acid jazz bass line, and there are a couple of deadly organ solos, but the whole thing is\nlet down by the one and only vocal; the endlessly repeated 'You've got to move to the\ngroove'. One of the remixes which cuts out the\nvocals altogether is top notch.\nLotte - Somebody's Fool\n'I'm exiting, sexy and cruel, but I'm just some-body's fool'. Femme rock a la Brooks, No\nDoubt, et al, though slightly less nauseating,\nwith a more imaginative guitar arrangement. The\ndelicate acoustic b side 5fn December suits her\nvoice so much more, and almost makes the\nrecord worth buying\nThe Verve - Lucky Man\nAnother solid single from Ashcroft and co.; perhaps with a little less of the immediate appeal of\nthe last couple of records, and it goes a little too\nmuch John Power on occasion. Not bad, but a bit 'Verve-by-numbers'.\nWay Out West - A/ are 2\nGently put together, yet hard house music,\ndarkly arranged with an un intrusive, even dis-tant, vocal part. Way Out West showing why\nthey are one of the most sought after dance\nbands out there. All you need is a whistle and its\nIbiza 1994 all over again. H Mr. Trout\n\n"

    "content": "21 November 1997 COLUMNS\nThank Cod it's over. After more\nelections in a year that Italy\nmanages, we finally have a pre s ident. Congratulations to Messrs\nHeeps and Joynt, who 1 am sure\nwill do what is required of them.\nAs usual, there is considerable disquiet about the role of the medical\nblock vote, though I detect that\nthis time it is a little bit fiercer than\nusual. Yes, on the face of it, it is a disgrace. At first, it does appear to\nbe the pathetic action of an egotistical union executive committee.\nBut this is unfair. We must consider the special circumstances relating to medical schools. In a nut-shell, they are not quite as sophisticated as the South Ken mob, not\nreally capable of assimilating complex issues and views. Evidence of\nthis is clear- one only needs to\nlook at the last round of Research\nAssessments. The only ratings\nbelow 4 were achieved by the\nmedics, thereby dragging down\nthe College down from its\ndeservedly lofty position. To be\nfair, things will improve as these\nnew boys are brought under the\nImperial wing. St Mary's, for all\ntheir talk of intellectual superiority,\nused to get fairly dismal ratings,\nbut they have now redeemed\nthemselves under our guidance.\nMark my words, when we get\nthem all licked into shape, block\nvotes will become a thing of the\npast and we shall be one big,\nhappy family.\nTwo weeks\nago I brought\nworrying news\nabout the Holland\nClub, the refuge ~\u2014~\nfor many of us in\nCollege. The s ug CT[ mK\"\nges tion was that\nCollege Catering ^\nwere going to Q take over control\nof this august\norganisation. \u2022\u2014\u2022\nFortunately, this IS)\nnot now the case,\naccording my old sparring partner\nJohn Foster, Head of Catering. He\nvery kindly informed me that there\nwere never any plans to do so, and\n1 am prepared to accept that at\nface value. Less charitable souls\nhave suggested that this has all the\nhallmarks of aU turn, a view to\n4 af which I do not subscribe. So that's settled, I hope.\nThe media are much valued by\nImperial College, and rightly so.\nEven in my own case, I know that\nLynda Davies, Head of PR, forever\nsings my praises and never misses\nmy birthday. Ever keen to help the\ngentlemen of\nD the Fourth\nEstate, Lynda\nand her people\n' \u2022 I produce a Media Guide, a lavish \u2022 book that\nlists all our\nT~ experts and their\ntU chosen fields.\nYou want to\nWgL \\mj know who can\nj Bf \u2014 \u2022 solve your drug\nJ problems? Look\nat the book.\nQuark queries? It's all in there. Any\njournalist would find it very helpful,\nso they all get copies if they want\nit. They also give a copy to all our\nexperts. Bearing in mind its quality\nand size, this must cost a small\nfortune, and the lucky recipients I have spoken to all say that is of no\nuse to them whatsoever.\nThis Devil-may-care attitude\nto costs is not new in\nSherfield, of course, but this is an\neasy one to solve. Why not only\nsend it to people that want it, thus\nsaving a lot of time an a lot more\nmoney, to be spent on something\nuseful such as undergraduate\nteaching? Radical concept, eh? By\nthe way, the Felix Office didn't get\ntheir copy... Look, keep your hair\non, Simon. The Felix office does\nhave a copy (although I picked it\nup myself) and although it looks\nexpensive, it is relatively useful.\nEd.\nFinally, 1 hope I didn't bore you\ntoo much this week, as Ali\nCampbell suggested last week in\nhis piece. Funny, incisive, witty, all\nwords that no one could reasonably use to describe his article. To\nbe accused of tedium by a man\nwho wrote 400 words on the hilarity of apportioning curry bills is a marvellous case of Dear Pot, Yours\nsincerely Kettle, I think you'll agree.\nThought for the day\nNo. 6: Ego\nIt's me! I'm beautiful! I rock! I'm the greatest\nman alive! I'm just so\nperfect!\nI never used to pay much attention in Latin lessons. I preferred\nto carve the word \"arse\" into the\ndesk with a pen so that nothing\nsave an industrial sand blaster\ncould remove it, and copy my second declension nouns off Peter\n\"ninety per cent or suicide\" Dodd.\nAs a result, I shall leave the\ntranslation of the word \"ego\" to\nbetter-informed scholars.\nWell, we've all got one. Some\npeople's are bigger than others'.\n(Ego, that is). A good thing or a bad one? All you young ladies\nwho tell me that an ego is the\nmost unattractive feature that a gentleman can have seem to\nreverse your allegiance when you\nare drunk. Why is it that when I spend three painstakingly ego-free hours with a nice member of\nthe opposite sex, using all my\ncharm, wit, and the eyelashes\nthat Cod gave me (all right, there\nis a bit of exaggeration going on\nhere, but bear with me), my\nefforts are ruined by a self-obsessed moron? Why does\nsome fat blok e with ether-strength armpits, a beard that\nwent out of fashion in the Ice\nAges, a disgusting check shirt\nthat was cobbled together by his\ngrandmother, and above all, a Hitler-size ego, stroll up and\nspend approximately two minutes forty five seconds telling her\nabout how many pints he can\ndrink before she lets him stick his\nmangy diseased tongue down her\nthroat? (Yes, I'm being really\nbitchy here. There is no justice in\nthe world of courting. Any young\nwoman who is not in the \"re pul sive-men-are-ac tu ally gorgeous-after-a few-pints\" brigade, I'd like to hear from you before I use\nmy column to inflict nineteen\nyears of sexual bitterness upon\nthe unsuspecting student pop u lace.) How many people find that\nthose of their friends with the\nbiggest self-worship coefficient\nare the most popular, while those\nthat try to be as ego-diminutive\nas they possibly can are regarded\nas soft, weak, unable to hold\ntheir alcohol, or even of dubious\nsexual standing?\nAll things considered, maybe I should turn into an egotistical\nlout so that I can begin to enjoy\nmyself a bit more. Women will\nfall at my feet as I pepper them\nwith my fantastic guitar-strum-ming abilities; friends will be possessed by true hero-worship\nwhen I tell them about how I once got 78% in a Physics test;\neveryone will really appreciate my\nboring them with knowledge of\nobscure indie bands from the\nearly 1990s, and of economics\nstatistics from the 1980s. Hey, a passport to popularity. Wait,\nwhere are you going?\nBeware. The ego is the path to\nthe world of the Spod. Avoid it at\nall costs.\nAli Campbell\n\n"

    "content": "MORE LETTERS 21 November 1997\nm t</y^ know who to believe and\n\"V&M to be honest I don't care.\ni WE The Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine was\nfounded on the first of August\n1997. The election of a new president should be a time for putting\npast grievances aside and allowing\nthis latest addition to Imperial\nCollege to have a chance to pro ove that it can work alongside the rest\nof the CCU's. Finally, am I just being suspicious to question the fact that one\nof the presidential candidates in\nthis election has credit as \"Right\nHand Man\" to Felix?\nYours\nNick Newton, ICSM\nI am very pleased to hear that,\nregardless of how you voted, you\ntook the time to talk to the candidates in person - if only everyone cared enough to do so. You\ncertainly cannot be accused of\nthe mindless block voting I was\ncomplaining about last week.\nThis is indeed a time to \"put past\ngrievances aside\" and cooperate;\nexactly why the lack of free voting\nwas such a disaster.\nI am however, extremely\noffended by your accusations\nthat I threw my support behind\none candidate. This is simply\nuntrue, and I challenge anyone to\nfind the slightest bias in Felix's election reporting. The reason\nthat Mark Baker appears in the\ncredits of Felix is that he contributes a vast amount of time\nand effort to the paper, as he has\ndone for several years. Ed\nOPERA LAST\nDear Jeremy,\nDue to an enormous cock-up\nby the Union officials, especially\nthe late lamented president, OpSoc\nhave been forced to move the\ndates of their show back a month.\nWe were given a promise to have\nthe Concert Hall for the first week\nof February by Eric Allsop last term,\nbefore we booked rights and fixed\nourselves up with a director, an MD and pianist. However, a member\nof our committee happened to be\nin the Union Office, and happened\nto hear that actually, despite everything we'd been told, the Concert\nHall was to go the Charing Cross\nand Westminster Operatic Society,\nduring the same week as ourselves,\neven though they shouldn't have\nbeen able to make a definite booking this far in advance. Obviously\nwe weren't particularly impressed.\nOK, I admit, the extra month might\nhelp by making the show even bet-ter, but if one society can be\npushed aside for another like this,\nwhat's to stop others being equally\nbadly treated? You might think I'm making a great fuss about nothing,\nbut this is serious. If we had been\ntold that we couldn't change the\nrights, we'd have had to cancel the\nshow completely, make new\narrangements and lose masses of\nmoney and time, and then possibly\nnot have been able to put on a show at all. This has been narrowly averted, fortunately. This comes\nas an unfortunate reminder not to\ntrust anyone's word, and to get\neverything in writing. I'd like to\nadd that I 've nothing against any\nother Operatic Societies, that I wish them nothing but success, as I know from bitter experience how\ndifficult it is to get anyone at this\nextremely artistic place to come\nand watch anything that isn'ta computer screen.\nYours sincerely,\nJulia Harries, Chem 2\nDON'T LOSE YOUR\nRAG\nDear Jeremy,\nI felt moved to write to Felix after\nreading the issue of Friday 14th, concerning the glaring inaccuracies contained in the \"Rag Mag Beyond A Joke\" article. 1 would like to know\nwhy, if Felix is supposed to be impartial, no-one on the RAG committee\nwas contacted to give our side of the\nstory: if someone had spoken to us,\nthen maybe the facts could have\nbeen printed in the story.\nSo, to the errors. Firstly, we\nwere only asked to delete two\njokes (not three), which we duly\ndid, before any copies were sold.\nSecondly, I would like to know\nabout the \"collection planned for\ntuesday morning\". In my position\nas secretary, I deal with organising\nlicenses for such collections, and\nunless 1 am suddenly suffering from\namnesia, our next collection is at\nthe Wimbledon vs Man Utd match\non Saturday, where we were never\nintending to sell RAG Mags.\n1 would also be interested to\nknow who \"voiced concerns\" that\nthe 'Mag' would not make any\nmoney. The production cost was\n43p per copy, and with a cover\nprice of \"60p minimum\" (and a substantial number of people who are\nprepared to pay a pound), by my\narithmetic if we sell a comparable\nnumber to last year, we should\nmake a reasonable profit (that is, if\nwe are allowed to...). Contrary to\nyour claim, advertising WAS\nsought, and it was unfortunate that\nno-one responded in time, despite\ninterest being shown. If you look at\nthe ICU RAG Mags from the previous decade (and even further\nback), you might notice that they\ndo not contain any advertising.\nPeople tend to (rightly) feel cheated when they buy a RAG Mag\nwhich is half full of adverts.\nAs for our new president's com-ment s, would it not have been fairer for him to speak to us first, and\nto leave spouting any sound bites that he had on the matter until after\nour meeting at the Union Exec,\nwhen we will have had a chance to\ngive our side of the story? I would\nalso be interested to know if he has\nseen the RCS RAG Mag, which has\nfar more potential to be offensive\nin content than our effort. Has he\nalso seen any previous ICU RAG\nMags? 1 suspect not, because, to\nthe best of my knowledge, this\nyear's is far less offensive than anything that has gone before it.\nFinally, on a lighter note, I'd like\nto take this opportunity to thank\nthe RCSU for organising and running a fantastic Beer Festival: certainly the best since I 've been here.\nYours,\nPaul Cole, Mech Eng 3,\n1CU RAG Secretary 1997-8.\nPS: Call me sad if you want, but I have counted the jokes in the RAG\nMag: There are 3 \"Gay\" Jokes, and 3\n\"Racist\" Jokes, including one of\neach which was censored. On the\nother hand, there are 1 1 \"blonde\"\njokes, numerous \"1C MenAVomen\"\nJokes, etc, so we think that if we\nhave been offensive, at least we\nhave been universally offensive.\nA joke is a joke, and if you took\nthem too seriously, then you would\neither have to be pretty stupid, or\nhave bigoted opinions anyway.\nAfter all, most people don't think\nthat all blonde women are REALLY\nslags, do they? I would also like to\npoint out that the ICU RAG committee which approved this RAG\nMag is Multiracial.\n1. The reason why we reported that three jokes were to be\ndeleted is that, at the time of\nwriting, three jokes were to be\ndeleted.\n2. The reason why we reported that you had a London collection is that the RAG chair gave us\na timetable that clearly states\n\"November 15th London\nCollection\".\n3. 60p over a cost of 43p is\nnot a good margin (the RCSU\nmanaged to produce a much\nthicker effort for less than 30p). Anybody who feels cheated if a mag they bought for charity contains adverts is clearly a cretin.\n4.1 have read the entire RCSU rag\nmag and found it much more\namusing and (therefore?) less\noffensive than your own.\n5. A joke is not, necessarily a joke. Of course people don't really think that blondes are slags,\nbut there are plenty of people out\nthere who think that black people\nand gays are stupid, inferior or\nworthy only of derision and\ndestruction. \"Jokes\" such as the\nones censored from your mag,\nonly serve to prolong and perhaps\nto incite such bigotry.\nYou write of such \"jokes\" \"if\nyou took them too seriously ...\nthen you would have to be pretty\nstupid.\" What makes you a better\njudge that the ICU president,\ndeputy president, manager, print\nmanager and printer, who all took\nthe matter very seriously? You\ncertainly make it very tempting to\nsuggest that the one who has\n\"bigoted opinions anyway\" is\nnone other than yourself. Ed\nTIMEWARP\nDear Felix\nI was sitting in the JCR today\nflicking through Felix when my\nattention was diverted by one of\nthose message boards that you see\nmade from little flashy red lights,\njust by the canteen. 11 told me that\nthe time was 16:36 though it had\nquite blatantly just gone three and\nthen continued by informing me\nthat the ICU cinema will reopen\nsoon showing \"The Adam's Family\nValues\" and \"Shindler's List\" in -get this - May 1994. Why is it\nthere? Why? Is it some in-joke that\nno-one has explained to me? Or\nwas it really set up in 1994 and\nhasn't been changes since? Can\nsomeone explain?\nThen I glanced down at the\nback page of Felix to see a 'recent'\nphoto of IC Shooting Club, one of\nwhom, a friend of mine, 1 know for\na fact to be living in Grenoble at the\nmoment on a year out. The photo\nmust be at least a year old.\nFeel like I am living in a time\nwarp. Perhaps I am.\nHelen Johns, Phys 2\nWhen I saw it, it was advertising\nthe ICU carnival with the Whirl y gig room. Made me feel quite\nnostalgic. Ed\n\n"

Chi also\nbowled his first ever 200+ game.\nAnd then he did it again! All teams\nbowled impressively, with a very\nhigh standard of bowling from all\nover the country, and although we\ndid not win, everyone had lots of\nfun.\nCanoeists sight Wales Volleyball invincible(ish)\nA proposed trip to visit the Tyne\nTour, where many other university\nclubs go, met with almost zero\nenthusiasm. However, it was\nnoted that the forecast was for rain\nin North Wales, so we could have a cheap trip away to the hut.\nHooray!\nThe 6 hour drive up there was\nunusual in that nothing appeared\nto go wrong. No boats lost, no\ntrailer detachment, only the sounds\nof eating from the back seats\n(Adam and Sonia appeared to be\nrather hungry all the way there).\nWater appeared scarce on arrival,\nbut levels rose overnight, not surprising given the rain.\nAfter breakfast the Conwy was\npicked as the river of choice for the\nday, a fine paddle marred only by\nDean playing 'pop goes the shou l der'. Ross was then delegated to\nfetch his car for the drive to\nLlandudno A+ E, while the rest of\nus left Ginger Baldy (mk II) to look\nafter the rest of the club. The elite\nteam of silly boat paddlers then\nheaded on down for the harder\nlower stretch. A fine chili and a good performance in the pub fol-lowed.\nSunday started a bit earlier, but\nwith the bonus of a flat tyre on the\ntrailer. We dumped it at the put in,\nbalanced on rocks while Ross again\nskipped a morning's paddling.\nMeanwhile everyone else was\nherded down the easy upper\nGlaslyn, uneventfully with the\nexception of Nicky trying to\nacquaint herself with the local trees\nagain, and Sonia collapsing due to\na lack of meat in her diet.\nFinally we arrived at the\nAberGlaslyn Gorge (scene of many\nan epic), with the water fairly high.\nOur new Nottingham boys went off\nwith the German n utters on the\nfirst run, Ross, Tim, Garth (in\nAdam's solid grade V boat) and\nMark followed, and caught them\nwhen Ginger Baldy (mk II) and Ali\n'the fish' swam, affording the rest\nof us much amusement. A second\nrun was swiftly arranged, with Rich\nCity Boy taking Phil's recommended line, and discovered a new form\nof fear in the back of his wetsuit\nwhen he vertically pinned in it.\nAll in all, one of the best trips\nwe've ever done, with records for\nattendance, female attendance,\nand beers consumed.\nNext trip: 11th13 th December, email slap per s@ ic.\nac.uk for more details, or check\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/clubs/rc c/ canoe.\nICVC v METS\nDespite some of our main players failing to attend the game, IC boys\nshowed the Metropolitan police that they rule when it comes to action\non the court. A combination of Ming on setting, Bass's left hand and\nRados' sonic spike destroyed their defence and shook their confidence.\nA breathtaking match ended up with 3-1 win and three valuable\npoints in the League table.\nICVC v UCL\nThe IC boys started the game with an unbeaten record so far in their\nBUSA and league games. The sole aim was to keep it that way. With\ncoach Panos out of action and giving orders from the li de lines, the boys\nwon the first two sets.\nHowever, thanks to an injury to Spyros the IC side then lost the third\nset.

    "content": "20\nFOOTBALL SHORTS\nVin Shanley\nC alvin and Hobbes. The Book\nof Insults. Last month's FHM. They're all \"dippers.\"\nThey all sit nicely on top of the cistern in your bathroom. All ready to\nbe \"dipped in\" whenever convenient. Toilet reading material. Isn't it brilliant? You can read however\nmuch you want and stop. You\ndon't have to finish a chapter or\nfind out what happens next. I mean, since when did anyone ever\nread War and Peace on the bog?\nFootball Shorts is lavatory literature for the football fans. There\nare hundreds of short anecdotes\nfrom King Eric, quotes from \"Turnip\nTaylor\" and gaffes that Tony Banks\nwould be proud of. The author\ntackles subjects systematically,\ndealing with managers, players,\ngoalies, referees, clubs and fans in\nseparate chapters. However, this\nisn'ta book that you just read\nstraight through. You pick it up\nnow and again, open it up at a random page and just read a few\nparagraphs.\nPlenty of quirky facts can be\nfound: Some Americans thought\nthat Glen Hoddle was a malt\nBOOKS\nwhisky. David Ginola is an anagram\nof vagina dildo! Perhaps the\nstrangest is the church in Surrey\nthat had footballer's shirts draped\non the pews and flags in the aisle\nfor a footballer's service. The vicar\neven opened his sermon with a few short blasts on a referee's whistle!\nThe best and funniest section\nby far, though, is the gaffes chap-ter. It's packed with a collection of\ncommentating cock-ups. There's Alan Ball's\"I'm not a believer in\nluck, although I do believe you\nneed it\", John Motson's \"The World\nCup - truly an international event\"\nand Gazza's infamous \" I never\npredict anything and 1 never will\ndo.\" In essence, this is a football\nbook but I think its appeal is very\ngeneral. So, if your toilet is short of\na good dipper, you could do a lot\nworse than this.\nPublisher: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a34:99 Dennis\nFURNACE\nMuriel Gray\nJ ust like an alcoholic hits the bottle,\na trucker hits the road. Stunned by\nthe news that his long time girlfriend is pregnant and has decided\nby herself to have an abortion, Josh\nSpiller gets into his electric blue\nPeterbilt and takes the first load he can\nfind that'll take him out of town. You\nsee, he feels comfortable sat in\nJezebel with the radio and CB fighting\nfor his aural attention. He can just let\nhimself slip into a trance and not\nworry about anything. The problem is\nhe's been on the road well beyond the\nlegal limit. So, as he drives the through\nthe strangely affluent town of Furnace\nlooking for a place for a quick nap and\na coffee, the unthinkable occurs. As he\napproaches a crossroads, a woman\nseems to appear at the side of the\nroad and pushes a baby with its pram\nunder the truck. Josh breaks but he's too late and this is where his nightmare begins.\nThe memory is etched into his\nmind but the image is torn. Witnesses\nreport that there was no woman, just\na gust of wind. The police play on\nJosh's fatigue and try to make him\nchange his statement, as the woman\nhe describes is actually the highly\nrespected town councillor, Nelly\nMcFarlane. Josh is confused: No-one\nis angry at him, no-one is condemning him for his carelessness and the\nsheriff, John Pace, is insisting that he\njust gets as far away from Furnace as\npossible. Josh leaves quickly but carries a demonic curse with him. He has\nthree days to live and the only way to\nreverse it is to go back and uncover\nFurnace's dark secrets.\nOne-time co-presenter of The\nClothes Show, this is Muriel Gray's second novel. (Her debut being The\nTrickster.) The main priority in a book\nof this sort is to give the reader something they can identify with so that\nthey actually care about what happens and if it wasn't for Josh's finely\ntuned sarcasm, the main character\nwould come across as a whining pain.\nAs it is, though, he makes us laugh\njust enough for us to sym pathis e with\nhim. The story moves very quickly. In\nfact, it could easily be made into a trash TV movie. There's nothing particularly bad about that. It's an enjoyable read but inevitably trash lacks\nsubstance. Apart from the early a cci dent, it fails to capture you as it did\nthen. However, it is tightly written.\nYou may not be monstrously excited\nbut you won't be bored either. This is\nonly Muriel Gray's second novel and I can see her getting better as she con-tin u es. Could be one to look out for in\na few years time.\nPublished by: Harper Collins\nPrice: \u00a316.99\nDennis\n21 November 1997\nHE DIED WITH A FELAFEL IN HIS\nHAND\nJohn Birmingham * * *\n\"He died....\" is basically a history of\nthe 89 flat mates the author had during eight years of house sharing. The\nbook is at times hilarious and always\nentertaining as the author races\nthrough the series of freaks and crazy\nanecdotes. For those of you who are\nsharing flats, I would expect that the\nbook would have an added punch to\nit. The book really works because of\ncharacters such as 'Thunderbird Ron',\na socially inept bodybuilder and PJ, a fish finger addict. There is also a clear\nImperial student - 'Brainthrust\nLeonard1\n, \"a gawky third-year engineering student with an unrivalled\nback catalogue of Star Trek fanzines\nand Australian Playboys\". Sound like\nanyone you know?\nThe chapters in the book deal on\nparticularly embarrassing or notable\nevents - such as destroying a housewarming after getting completely\nstoned in the 'Horny London Babes\nFiasco' (it's set in Australia by the\nway), or deal with one particular\nactivity - such as his enjoyment of listening to fellow flat mates having sex.\nInterposed between chapters are the\n'Voices of the damned\" - confessions\nby acquaintances on the terrible\nthings that they had done. These are\nespecially amusing, so 1 won't ruin\nthem for any of you. 1 should probably warn people with a delicate disposition that they may not enjoy this\nbook as much as I did, and they may\nprefer 'Pride and Prejudice' or something instead. Small paragraph sections by friends detailing their worst\nflat sharing experiences is a nice\ntouch and it increases the nightmares\nper page rating.\nIt obviously is not a book with\ngreat literary or scientific worth - but\nits not meant to have any. I would\ndefinitely recommend this book - borrow it from someone if you can.\nAnyone looking for flat mates should definitely read it to find\nout the danger signs of possible psychopaths and anyone should\nread it because it is very funny. It's a good quick read (I read it in an\nevening, but I did have to review it)\nand people with a sick sense of\nhumour should enjoy it more than\nmost, especially the bits about\nblok e swanking off dogs ....\nPublisher: Flamingo\nPrice: \u00a35.99\nChiron\n\n"

The\nmain advantage of this, (at least to\nsome of the students) was that at\nleast one of the study group tutors\ngave out glasses of wine during her\nsession. 1 would like to offer my\nthanks for this, as it certainly\nlivened the session up.\nI would suggest more tutors try\nsomething like this, as study group\nattendances would certainly\nincrease.\nYours,\nJames Phillips, Elec Eng II\nOPERA FIRST\nDear Editor,\nI would like to congratulate\nFelix for printing a useful preview of\nan opera several weeks in advance,\nso that I could book good seats.\nHaydn's La Fedelta Premiata at the\nGuildhall School of Music and\nDrama was absolutely s uber b, with\nglorious music, excellent acting\nand singing, and an extremely\nfunny production.\nThank you,\nDr Bernard Lamb, Biology.\nBLOCK VOTE OR\nDIVINE INTERVENTION?\nDear Felix,\nNice to see a bit of raw anger in\nlast week's editorial. I must say that\n1 do (for the most part) agree with\nall the points made. For too long,\nthere has been an \"us-and-them\"\nsituation with St Mary's and events\nlike these only serve to fuel mistrust on both sides of Hyde Park. In\nall subsequent elections, 1C SMU has always advocated block voting\nso, in fairness, this was to be\nexpected. However, a large part of\nmy anger points squarely at the\nstudents who did not vote because\nof either sheer idleness or plain\nstupidity. To all those people; do\nyou really not care who runs your\nunion? Do you have a Union card?\nDo you know what the black metal\nbox is?\nEqually though, criticisms levelled at the medics of being \"child-ish\" are also important. I think that\nby block voting, the medics are\neffectively saying, \"we can't think\nfor ourselves.\" Without being ironic\n(1), surely all medics have a mind of\ntheir own and can decide for them-selves? This leads me to believe\nthat this was more of a political\nassertion by ICSMU to ensure that,\ndespite us all being part of the\nsame College, they are, in all but\nname, still a seperate entity. By\nacting in this manner, the medics,\nand in particular ICSMU exec, can\nonly expect contempt from other\nstudents here (from those who can\nactually be bothered to have an\nopinion, that is). Grow up, St\nMary's exec, and wake up the rest\nof you.\nDetracting from criticism\n(unusual for me, I know), I would\nlike to congratulate Charlie Joynt on\nhis victory. At least in this case,\nthere are no doubts that we have\nthe right man for the job. I would\nalso like to thank Simon Baker for\nhis highly flattering comments in\nhis column last week. Simon, your\ncash is the post. Also, on a more\nlighthearted note, have you ever\nrealised that Jeremy looks like\nGeorge Dawes (from Shooting\nStars) but with hair? Uncanny...\nRegards,\nRobert Emerson JMC2\nOk, let's clear this up right\naway...\nThomson Dawes\nTwo things before I start: I do\nnot expect this to be published\n(though it would be nice) and I am\nwriting not only for myself but after\nseveral people have asked me to.\nFelix is a the newspaper of the\nImperial College Students Union.\nThe student is made up of all the\nconstituent colleges, as was\nexplained to me when I came over\nto Imperial for the hustings. ICSM\nis now part of Imperial ans as such\nit is highly inappropriate behaviour\nfrom the editor of Felix to make the\ncomments that he made in his edi-to rial.1 am not going to write here\nthat 1 was unbiased in the way that\nI voted. Andi Heeps is a friend of\nmine, but at the hustings I made\nthe effort to talk to Mark Baker to\nfind out for myself what he was like\nbecause if he had been the better\ncandidate I would have voted for\nhim. Medical students, like most of\nImperial College students I am led\nto believe, are blessed with minds\nof our own. If certain factions\ndecide to throw in a block vote\nthen they are doing so of their own\nfree will and not because someone\nhas coerced them into doing so.\nThe way the votes are cast,\nwith each person filling in the voting slip themselves makes me\nsceptical of how particular to\nMary's this \"block vote\" is. The statistics show that the South\nKensington campus voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mark\nBaker. This wouldn't have anything\nto do with a block going on against\nmedics among the few students\nthat bothered to vote would it?\nAs a source of information and\ncomment for the students it is\nFelix's responsibility to ensure that\npeople know that elections are taking place and to encourage as\nmany people to vote as possible\nbut in a non-partisan way. Instead\nit appears that the editor threw his\npersonal backing behind one candidate and is now acting like a spoilt\nchild who has not got his own way.\nThis is not good journal sim and it is\ncertainly not the sort of behaviour\nthat 1 would expect from an intelligent person who obviously realises\nthe power of position.\nSince becoming involved in ICU\nactivities at the beginning of term\nall I remember hearing is how badly\nthe ICU has been treated by\nMary's, Something I find hard to\nbelieve given the fact that you outnumber them almost ten to one.\nWhen 1 actually spoke to people in\na position to know at South\nKensington they denied that Mary's was ever a trouble maker. I do not\nDeadline for letters is 6pm Tuesday. Letters may be edited for\nlength, but will not be altered or corrected in any other way.\nLetters may be signed or anonymous, but please show your swipe\ncard when submitting them.\n\n"

    "content": "21st November 1997 MUSIC 15\nALBUMS\nSomething To Remember Me By * * * * '/2\nALABAMA 3\nExile On Coldharbour Lane *\nIf B en Lee. Who is he? Well, this\nAustralian singer made some\nwaves in 1994 when his now\ndefunct teen punk band Noise\nAddict released their debut album,\nCrandpaw Would, Since then, Ben\nhas enlisted the services of the\nmost wonderful of instrumental\ncompanions, the trusty acoustic\nguitar. What we have here is 14\nsimple acoustic songs. Just Ben\nand his guitar. Well, 13 really. A Month Today, the world-weary\nsong which shows Ben to be older\nthan his official 18 years, is performed a cappella.\nMusically, Ben pretty much\nuses the same formula throughout\nthis album. A nice little rhythm and\nan uncomplicated strumming s ys tem. However, formulas don't become formulas for no reason at\nall. They become formulas because\nthey work. The treat is Ben's lyrics.\nEach song may have the same\nmusical base but each tells its own\nstory. Mostly experiences from\nBen's life, they're cleverly written.\nEight Years Old is the best,\ntelling a touching story of first love.\nDuring a bus-ride, Ben meets the\ngirl he loved but was rejected by\nwhen he was eight and she touches his knee. He feels like he's eight\nagain but can't accept the offer,\ntelling her, T was in love. I was\neight. Almost a decade later. A decade too late.' 1 mean, 1 know\nthere's not many romantics out\nthere (or are there?) but that is\nbeautiful beyond words.\nDaisy also explores the theme\nof unrequited love in youth. Career\nChoice chronicles the part of Ben's youth in which he fell victim to procrastination and is full of T could\nhave been....'-type lines. There's2 Sisters, which has a slightly smoky\nafter hours feel, which analyses\nwhy some people just don't get on\nwith each other. There's also a humourous and equally serious\ntrack about fallen 80s TV stars from\nshows such as Family Ties, Punky\nBrewster, Growing Pains and\nDifferent Strokes. In short, Ben is a gifted songwriter. Simple tunes are\njust the basis for the almost effortlessly familiar way in which he\nexpresses himself. So, I give you\nBen Lee. I'm sure they'll be even\nmore to remember him by in the\nfuture. CI\nDennis\nIf this album were a woman it\nwould be Victoria Adams. If it\nwere a footballer it would be\nDavid Beckham. 1 like this CD, it\nmakes me smile. And if I didn't already own it...I'd go out and buy\none. Well actually I am not Jeremy\nClarkson, Master of Bullshit, and\nExile On Coldharbour Lane only\nresembles Posh Spice in that it definitely does not smile, just like me\nwhen I'm listening to it. There are\nmany reasons why. The album contains a distinct lack of variety, so\nsadly falling victim to, and indeed\nbeing found very, very guilty of the\nsame charges that are constantly\nthrown at dance music. In my op in ion, it sounds like funky-styled\ncountry and west e my blues with\nrepetitive, unimaginative beats and\nrhythms. Oh yeah, and the occasional political message thrown in\nfor good measure. Excessive listening will undoubtedly leave your\nears with a deep and immediate\nyearning for some quality sounds.\nO.K., it's not so bad that your\nbrain will bleed before you are able\nto reach for the eject button. But if\nan album can, at best, barely reach\nthose not-so-dizzy heights of plain\nmediocrity, then what's the point\nin buying it? If you are lucky enough\nto have a burning hole in your\npocket then 1 say let it smoke, let it\nsmoulder. DON'T BUY THIS CD.\nFor I'm sure you'd rather briefly\nsuffer from mild thigh burn than\nown this ranking stain of monkey\njism.\nIf this album were a woman, it\nwould be Marlene from\nNeighbours. If it were a footballer it\nwould be my mum. And the full 63\nminutes of this trash could only be\nconceivably endurable under the\nheady influence of some very top\ngear. EH Gabriel\nTHA BOMBI\nHow all tha b boys and b girls doin? Its\nanother week and another column, more\nnews about what's goin' on in the world of hip\nhop and RnB.\nTupac's back. Released this Monday is a new album of unheard 2Pac cuts from his old\ndays with Interscope Records (1991-1994).\nThe posthumous release is a double LP called\nRU Still Down (Remember Me), the CD version includes a12 page booklet all about the\nman. From what I 've been told the album\ncomprises of a couple of choice cuts and a load of stuff that wasn't considered good\nenough for release when he was alive.\nThe Fresh Prince is back, except Will no\nlonger wants to called the Fresh Prince,\ninstead he is Will Smith movie mega-star and\nhip hop star. Well that's what he says he is,\nhaving had the opportunity to listen to a couple of the cuts off the forth coming album, I would describe him as a movie mega-star and\na POP star. If the rest of the album is anything like the tracks I heard then it can only\nbe described as commercial pop/swing, the\nLP's called Big Willie Style and will be drop pin' in next week\nTha Bomb album of the week is the medicine man Lynden David Hall's Medicine 4 My\nPain, this man has brought an album that is\nsoul at its very best. The musical content is\nbest described as Nu Soul and with this LP he\nhas gone up directly against big name\nAmericans such as Maxwell and D 'Aneglo and\nfor me he has come out on top, this deserves\nto be massive and if his record company\nbacks it then it will be. This will be a classic\nso don't hesitate for a minute when buying.\nOn a single tip there are some serious trax\nbeing released on British this week and a trip\ndown to the local record store to purchase\nthese three tunes is essential. First up we got\na British RnB group, Truce with their joint\nNothin' But A Party, this has got that party\nvibe to it, if there was any justice this would\nblow up massive; this is a tune, buy. The original first ladies of hip hop, Salt'N 'Pepa, return\nafter a long time out with their new album\nBrand New, the first single to be lifted from it\nis RU Ready. Now I heard this track an age\nago and I 've been telling y 'all about for a time,\nand at last it's here. This bang in' high tempo\ntrack is a stone cold killer; it comes on two\nCDs l&J., with the second CD containing the\nhit singles Shoop, Whatta Man & the classic\nLets Talk About Sex. My third and final single\nrecommendation is the latest Missy joint Sock\nIt 2 Me, this is the second cut from her highly acclaimed debut album. The groove is created by Timbaland and the Da Brat helps out\nas a guest, listen to this and you'll want it.\nOther singles out or drop pin' soon include\nStomp from Cods Property, this dope little\ngospel track has Salt (from Salt'N 'Pepa)\nappearing on rap duty, this good and well\nworth a listen. The latest offering from Shola\nAma is a ballad called Who's Loving My Baby,\nthis is as good as the previous two and should\nfly straight into the top spots in the chart. For\nall the DnB boys I have to met ion the massive\nDigital from Golide, this is rough and raw, a baseline that blows you away, KRS1 is pure\nclass, this is Tha Bomb.\nTill next time, I'm out.\nTha Bomb! - Diary Dates\nThere's loads of shit goin' on in the capital in the upcoming weeks and its time for a run down of all the bang in' dates. The craziest hip hop sound, horror rap, comes to town\nas The Gravediggaz fly in to promote their new\nalbum, they play at Subterania, Ladbroke\nGrove on Wednesday (26), doors open at nine.\nThis is a must for all the true hip hop head z, it'll be one muth a fuck a of a night. Another\ngroup of innovative hip hoppers, Spearhead,\nbring their sound to us the following week on\nDecember 3rd at the Forum; Michael Franti\nand the boys always put on a good show. On\na RnB tip, the three funky divas, En Vogue hit\ntown on December 4th, this will sell out so\nget those tickets quick. Looking to the future,\nthe most eagerly awaited concert date was\nrecently announced - Puffy playing Wembley\nArena on January 13th. Puffy and the whole\ndamn family coming over for their first ever\nEuropean concerts, big name family members\nLi 1\n\" Kim and Mase will be in attendance, so get\nthose tickets fast.\nAf//en\n\n"

A number of pub\nlandlords have alleged that students were being rowdy and were\nabusive to other punters. According\nto a member of the bar staff at The\nDove Inn on the Upper Mali, who\nclaimed to have been on duty that\nevening, they received a telephone\nwarning from another pub, The Old\nShip, saying that the students \"had\njust started a ruckus\".\nHe said that after the students\nhad left, they went out to \"check\nthe back\" where they discovered\nthat a table had been thrown into\nthe adjacent River Thames and that\nbathroom plumbing had been\nripped out and toilet seats taken\noff. However he went on to tell\nFelix that \"it wasn't really a big\ndeal... most of the students were\nout for a good time... most of them\nwere nice kids. It was just a small\nhandful of maybe five or six\". At the\nnext pub, the Blue Anchor, a barman said that \"the students were\nabusive to staff... and insisted on\nstanding on chairs and singing.\" He\nthen went onto say that Police\nwere called. It was later discovered\nthat parasols had been thrown in\nthe river. A member of staff at The\nRutland added that the students\nwere being \"extremely obnoxious...\nthey were abusive to the landlord\nand they started dropping glasses\non the floor blatantly. When we\nasked them to leave, they threw\numbrellas and a table into the\nriver... there's moorings down the\nway, and it's a worry to the boat\npeople.

Call her what you like,\nthe Icelandic princess, the quirky\nweird singer who likes a bit of wailing and screaming now and again\nor just plain Bjork. The result is\nalways guaranteed to be the same,\nsheer class and stylish stage presence. The backdrop was a funky mix\nand mash of paper streamers that\ncreated an eerie effect of a living\nforest under the glare of the lights.\nInitially the backing musicians\nentered the stage, eight string players in all, including two double\nbassists. Unlike her previous HUGE\nscale tour(she played Wembley\nArena last time), this time round\nshe has decided against playing all\nthe instruments live, probably more\nto do with the fact that it is a much\nshorter affair.\nThe woman herself came on to\nthe sound of Hunter, opener off\nHomogenic, and the whole set\nstarted off like a dream. Clever\nlighting kept Bjork's face in the dark\nthroughout this track, creating an\nair of mystery to her already\nunfathomable persona. She shot\nthrough the set with a number of\ntop class tracks, Homogenic providing the majority of the material,\nthough it was spread pretty evenly\nover all three albums. Inevitably she\nhas now got such a large repertoire, she can't play all the tracks\nyou hope to hear. Those lacking\ntonight were classics like Big Time\nSensuality and Army Of Me, but\nthankfully she restrained from playing the pompously char to phil ic It's Oh So Quiet. What she missed out\non were more than made up for by\nthe outstandingly gorgeous songs\nthat blended perfectly with her\nmagnificent voice (you either love it\nor loathe it). The crowd showed\ntheir appreciation by the obviously\npositive reception given to each\ntune, especially in Violently Happy\nwhere the rare sight of po going was exhibited. One candid moment\nin the set was during a recent track\nlifted from the new LP when she\nsang '....Baby!', as though she was\ntrying to do an uncanny impersonation of Madonna. She, even managed to laugh at this e mbar is singly schizophrenic remark. The string\nADAM Colours^^ \u2022f his is an album that simply\nI hasn't been out of my CD\nJl player since I got hold of it\n(and yes 1 do have other CD's). It is\nquite simply one of the best e pies of no-messing jazz-stepping\ndrum 'n' bass avail i ble. It starts off with a funky bongo\nand wah-wah jam that makes you\nthink it's about to break into the\nShaft theme music.

However, the blend\nof samples and less hectic beats\nmakes the album a much mellower\nlisten and the whole thing hangs\ntogether really well. It's clear from\nthe start that this album is not destined for the dancefloor but has\nbeen put together for listening\npleasure.\nThis is just one of those albums\nwhich sounds like a greatest hits\nplayers orchestrated their sounds\nwith the pounding emotion captured in all of her albums while the\nbasic foundations of the tracks\nhave moved away from your normal everyday beats present on the\nfirst two albums to slightly more\nirregular rhythms and scathing,\nscraping sampled beats.\nUndoubtedly the most heartfelt\ntrack off Homogenic is jog a but live\nsomething seemed to be missing,\nleaving you cheated of an expected\nmasterpiece. However this was\nprobably the only flaw tonight in an\notherwise complete set.

I work together with Trevor Morgan\nand Chris Gower on the new dance and club section of Felix. We aim to cover reviews, features\nand club listings on a wide range of dance music;\nreflecting the London scene as it really is!\nThe Electric Cafe is also the name of a radio\nshow that I run weekly on the Student Radio\nNetwork for two hours (Sunday night/Monday\nmorning @ midnight till 2am). It can be listened\nto using IC Radio. Each show aims to introduce\npeople to a variety of electronic music; from\ndrum'n 'bass to funky techno, ambient to deep\nhouse. Most of all we believe very strongly that\nthere is something for everybody in electronic\nmusic. We interview artists and DJs in order to\nmake the music less faceless and more personal.\nSo do listen in if you are interested!\nNow that the plugging is out of the way, I should get on with the column and a very interesting new club night that has caught my eye. To\ncoincide with the new single by LA Synthesis (see\ntechno reviews section), a joint venture between\nVent and Universal Language is starting tonight at\nThe Soundshaft (Hungerford Lane, London WC2).\nUniversal Language is a label that has been\nputting out some outrageously funky electronic\nmusic for several years, with big acts such as the\njedi Knights and Gerd currently enjoying enormous critical acclaim. Tonight you will be able to\nsee LA Synthesis and Spacetime Continuum (aka\nJonah Sharpe from Reflective Records in San\nFranscisco) playing live. Tom Middleton and Mark\nPritchard from Global Communications will be up\nCLUBSCENE - COMPILATIONS\n1 0 1 % SPEED GARAGE\non the decks. All this for a mere \u00a35 if you remember your student card. Now that can't be bad for a Friday night can it?\nFinally, if you are beginning to think about\nChristmas Presents for friends, then I want to recommend three great DJ mix albums on CD.\nThe MayDay Mix (Open) is by one of the originators of techno music. Derrick May hails from\nDetroit and has become a legend with tracks such\nas Strings of Life. His DJ talents are no less awe-some. He keeps his mix extremely funky yet varies\nthe musical style throughout. There are no rules\nwhen he is on the decks. Tracks are stopped midway through and even mixed backwards into each\nother. This is an essential album for c lubbers and\nDJs alike!\nX Mix Deep Space Radio (Studio !K7) features\nthe mixing talents of another Detroit Legend,\nKevin Saunderson who was the brains behind\nInner City and E Dancer. This is a varied selection,\nfeaturing hard techno from Dark Comedy hand-in-hand with minimal house from Octave One. As\nyou would expect, the mixing is flawless.\nSubculture (Subclub/BMG) has been prepared\nand mixed by one of the pioneers of the Glasgow\nscene, DJ Harri. The character of the mix is\nsmooth and seamless, which is appropriate as the\nmusical style represented throughout is deep\nsoulful house music. This album is not about taking you higher, but instead putting you in a groove. It works well in the bedroom as well as on\nthe dancefloor.\nAlick\nON THE\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSPCECED\nGAI\nThe most unimaginative title in the\nworld ever!\nW ith the explosion of\nSpeed Garage onto the\nLondon club scene, and\nthe increasing popularity of it\nthroughout the rest of the country,\nit is inevitable that the period\nbefore Christmas will see countless\ncompilations being released under\nthe title of 'Speed Garage'.\nThe mission, if I wished to\naccept it, was to search out an\n'album' which truly represents the\nscene at this present time.\nThis CD is an hour long epic live\nin the mix from Trinity at the\nChunnel Club by DJ Jay Dee. Trinity\nis a night in Vauxhall which caters\nfor both the Speed Garage and\nHard House scenes, and this is a set played out to a packed crowd\nof serious c lubbers. The opener, Kym Mazelle's Big\nBaby is a soulful starter which combines funky beats with catchy lyrics.\nThe next two tunes are on the\nsame wavelength, with large lyrical\ncontent, before DJ Ride and\nMichael King's Renegade Bass, featuring remnants of a classic old\nSkool tune, takes over and treats all\nto the first real helping of raw Drum\n'n' Bass. This ingredient is very\nmuch in full effect from then on,\nwith a bass y sound system continuously screaming to be turned\nup. 187 Lockdown's Gunman, possibly the most recognised speed-garage tune features, as does\nPeekay's Sweet Sensation , another\ntune which brings back memories\nfrom the 90's Old Skool era.\nThe album closes with New\nHorizons It's My House and\nSmokin Beats Vol 4 jazz House,\nboth of which take a more tune-ori-ent a ted approach as opposed to a phat and p hun kee bassline. This\nconcludes an hours worth of music\nwhich covers all components of\nthis particular scene.\nAll in all, this compilation contains 16 massive underground\ntunes which are expertly remixed\nby Jay Dee. A worthwhile addition\nfor those in the know, and a damn-good starter for those wanting to\nget in the know, del Chris\nAt the EC1 Club\nIf speed garage is your scene\nand you're looking for a late\nThursday night out, then we\nhave found the club for you. 'On\nThe Edge' boasts resident DJs '\nThe Dreem Teem' and Dexter, as\nwell as other big name DJs on\nrotation, playing only the finest\nunderground tracks.\nDue to the late opening hours\n- the latest in London for a Thursday night - it is considered\nas more of an after club and so the\ncrowd do not arrive until li sh. Most of them are regulars, and\ncan only be described as\n'London's Nuttas',- they have\nevery intention of dancing all night\nuntil the lights go up at 6am. Within the silver walls and\ndecor, the atmosphere is 'chilled\nout'. You won't find the attitude\nthat some clubs have become\nfamous for.

It\ntakes place in a funeral parlour\nwhere people have come to view\nand pay their last respects to various deceased - a bizarre situation\nwe are not familiar with in this co un try. Yet these three stories, each\nabout different lives, people and\nthemes are not brought together by\nthe morbid element present in each,\nbut by the different way they each\nportray the idea of love in it's most\npleasurable, horrible and amusing\nforms.\nThe first tale we hear is that of\nEmil, the funeral director played by\nRobert Jeez, who is going through\nthe agonies of unrequited love as he\nwatches the object of his 'silent'\ndesire use the viewing to build up\nher contacts for her real-estate bus i ness. The feelings, that I am sure we\nhave all experienced, are displayed\nwith such honesty and honour that\nwe laugh with, not at, the somewhat\nsad figure.\nThis is followed by the story of\nMac (Karen Ascot) who tried to forget her troubled past by carving herself a lucrative career - corpse rob-bing. We are taken by her brash,\nconfident personality through the\nwickedly amusing episode of trying\nto rob her now deceased grand-mother. It's not long, however,\nbefore the tough outgoing exterior is\nbroken by the reality of her life. It's a shocking and moving tale.\nFinally we meet the recently widowed Virginia, played by Ann\nPenfold, who has inherited unpaid\nand un payable debts. As the tale\nwinds itself slowly into a knot, leaving the overwhelmed widow\ntrapped and helpless, a cunning\ntwist of fate provides an ingenious\nanswer.\nEach story is wonderfully written\ntwisting to some unexpected cli-max, and each gripping ly told,\npulling the audience through a range\nof raw emotions. The intimate theatre and stage put the truth and\nreality of the situation directly in the\nface of the audience and when one\nof the actresses reduces herself to\ntears you are truly able to believe\nher sad plight.\nWith no entrances or exits, no\nflashy lighting changes and minimal\nstaging and movement, it's hard to\nsay whether this play might appeal\nto the majority of people. (In a theatre that could possible seat 100\npeople I somehow don't think that\nthis is the intention.) The acting is\nsuperb (the credentials in the program are enough to tell you this)\nand their use of the audience and\nscript delightful.\nIt is an evening of looking at\ndeath in a light we are not quite\nused to, being drawn through a depth of emotions, and walking out\nwith a smile on you face. Strange,\nbut true.\nMatt Williams\n\n"

In a worrying ly vertical career move Miss Silverstone\nplays spoilt brat Emily T. Hope,\nwho stages her own kidnapping in\norder to attract the attention of her\ncareer-obsessed father (Jack\nThompson). She foolishly locks\nherself in the boot of her car to\nawait her pick up, clearly not anticipating the presence of a car thief\n(Del Toro) and the inevitable hilarious consequences. But there's more to it than that.

A great piece of daring and original\ncasting has Walken as Emily's menacing and on-the-edge uncle who\ngoes looking for her, and Del Toro\nis also pretty good doing his\nFenton in The Usual Suspects act.\nBut we've seen these things before,\nand in much better films.

The handful of exceptions (eg Apocalypse Now) is now\ngreatly enriched by Regeneration, a film full of deeply disturbing and\nharrowing images. Adapted from\nthe novel by Pat Barker, it tells the\nstory of Dr William Rivers (Pryce),\nthe renowned psychiatrist in\nCraiglockart Castle, a13 th century\nkeep just outside Edinburgh which\nwas used as a military hospital for\nshell-shocked soldiers during the\nfirst world war. Rivers himself is on\nthe edge of a breakdown as a result\nof his involvement with his\npatients. They include Siegfried\nSassoon (Wilby), a brilliant and\nheroic soldier who is by no means\nmentally disturbed, but has been\nsent to the asylum for publishing an\noutspoken - and illegal - pamphlet\nproclaiming his opposition to the\nwar. Sassoon strikes up a friendship with fellow patient\nWilfred Owen (Stewart Bunce),\nencouraging him to write some of\nthe finest poetry to emerge during\nthe war (and indeed this century).\nSeemingly un constrained by the\nfilm's modest budget, Regeneration\nis brilliantly directed by Gillies\nMackinnon, who manages to draw\nfaultless performances from the\nentire cast and crew. Even the\nromantic sub-plot of Billy's love\naffair with Sarah (Tanya Allen in her\nfeature film debut) - turns out to be\nessential to the film as it is used as\na contrast to the devastation of\nwar. Essentially the film is more\nabout humanity and the nature of\nmind rather than war itself. It works\nat a very subtle level, showing\nrespect for its audience by not forcing any viewpoint upon them whilst\nconfronting them w j th their own\nmorality. You will need to take your\nbrain with you for this one but it's worth the effort.

Since Malaysian students\nare considered 'overseas stu-dents' they are obliged to pay a tuition fee much higher than self-supporting home students.\nFor example, in Imperial\nCollege an Engineering Undergraduate course for a self-sup-porting student would cost about\n\u00a3750 per annum, while for an\noverseas student it would cost\nmore than \u00a39000. It has also\nbeen mentioned in the Times\nHigher Education supplement that\nthe potential fee income from the\n18,000 Malaysian postgraduates\nand undergraduates would\nexceed \u00a3130 million.\nPRAED STREET\nRAPES\nSt Mary's Union are warning students and staff to be on their\nguard, after two women were\nraped in the road adjacent to the\nmedical school. The women were\nattacked in separate but similar\nincidents where they were approached from behind by a man\nwith a knife, who then forced\nthem into a nearby vehicle driven\nby an accomplice. Both women\nwere subsequently gang-raped.\nRob Clark, lC U's Deputy President\n(FfkS), has also urged students to\nexercise caution in the area.\nOn Tuesday, the British Medical\nAssociation published the first\nmajor report on the therapeutic\nuse of cannabis. It drew distinctions between recreational and\nmedicinal uses of the drug; thousands of people currently resort\nto the illegal use of cannabis in an\nattempt to ease the symptoms of\ncancer, muscle s past i city, pain,\nanorexia, epilepsy, glaucoma,\nbronchial asthma, mood disorders\nand psychiatric conditions, and\nhypertension. It is also thought to\nease the joints of arthritis suffer-ers. Most of the prior claims of\npain relief from the drug has been\nanecdotal, but the report examines the scientific evidence for the\nwider medicinal use of can nib in oid s( cannabis derivatives); it\nsets a future research agenda and\nidentifies the legal steps that need\nto be taken before new treatments can be developed. It suggests that advice should be given\nfrom the WHO to the UN\nCommission on Narcotic Drugs to\nreschedule certain can nib in oid s under the UN Convention on\nPsychotropic Substances. If that\nfails, the Government is to consider changing the Misuse of\nDrugs act to permit the prescription of certain can nib in oid s to\npatients whose symptoms are\ninadequately controlled under\npresent arrangements.\nCareers Fair Fares\nWell\nIVAN CHAN\nThis year's careers fair has\nreceived a record turn-out both\nin terms of the number of students that has visited the fair as\nwell as the number of companies\nwhich were involved.\nIn total 1500 brochures were\ndistributed throughout the day\nwithin the Union Building. There\nwere more than forty companies\nattending the Fair. The three largest\nvenues within the Union Building\nwere used. The Union Concert Hall,\nUnion Dining Hall and the Union\nGym were packed with employers,\ntheir stalls and job-hunting students during the day. One visitor\ncommented \"1 think that this gives\nus an good opportunity to try and\nPhoto: Xavier\ndecide what do with our lives in the\nfuture.\"\nAccording to Mark Home, the\nEvents and Marketing manager of\nImperial College Union, the companies are \"very happy and had\nvery nice things to say about average IC student.\"\nThis year's careers fair was\norganised by ICU, arranged by Mr\nHome and ICU Office Manager\nMichelle Lewthwaite during the\nsummer and into this term. It has\nbeen the biggest independent student union-organised fair in the\nUK. Students can also use the\nCareers Office in the Sherfield\nBuilding throughout the year.\nRCS Union Finally Elects President\nANDY SINHARAY\nAfter a summer of administrative\nturmoil the RCSU Elections took\nplace last week, only a couple of\ndays after those of Imperial\nCollege Union. Though only\naround 200 votes were cast, the\nturnout of 11% was comparable\nto that of the recent ICU\nElections.\nThe former RCSU vice-pre si dent, Rob Park, told Felix that there\nhad been no logistical problems. \"It\nwas slow,\" he said, commenting on\nthe progress of the proceedings.\n\"Turnout was lower than 1 hoped,\nbut it wasn't surprising,\" he said,\ngoing on to cite the timing of the\nelections being so close to those of\nICU and the time of year. The new\npresident of the RCSU is Physics\nPhD student Helen-Louise\nWindsor, who beat her only op pos er, Hooman Behnia, by 98 votes to\n45; 40 voted for new Election. \"The\noverall turnout was so poor,\" she\ncommented, and said that during\nher campaign she had encountered\nconfusion and even ignorance from\nvoters about which elections she\nwas standing for. On the question\nof the relevance of the Kensington\nCCUs, she was convinced that they\nstill have a role in the modern IC. \"1\nwouldn't have stood for a role in a CCU of I believed they didn't have a future,\" and went on to mention\ntheir potential importance after the\nmedical merger. Rufina Emo and\nDave Wharton were jointly elected\nfor the post of Vice President, and\nwere the only candidates standing.\nThe job of Academic Affairs Officer\nwas similarly taken by Phil Smith\nand Nic Thompson.\n\n"

Even the IC Fourths would\nhave been disappointed with such\na performance. Injuries to key players meant that Chris Tannizeris\nmade his first team debut while\nJules Porreca made a comeback at\nright-back. The latter struggled and\nwas at fault for UMDS' opener 15\nminutes into the first half. Things\ndid not improve after that and\nSteve Fleming dropped back into\ndefence as the Firsts switched to\ntheir customary 3-5-2 formation in\na bid to get back into the game.\nUMDS got another after a terrible\nmix-up between Donal Keane (yet\nto recapture his glorious form of\nlast season) and German Shanidze.\nA half-time talk by captain Psycho\nworked miracles as Imperial pulled\none back straight after the restart\nafter a UMDS defender headed a Richard Pratt cross into his own\ngoal. What followed was massive\nIC pressure; Amo hit the post and\nhad an amazing bicycle kick which\njust went over the bar, while top\nscorer Alex Marcos managed not\ntop score on more than one occ a sion. In the end UMDS managed to\nhold on to their lead. How could\nthis happen? As with World War II\nwe must make sure that this never\nhappens again. That's rubbish. We\nare at war with every College in\nLondon and, of course, Germany.\nOne battle may have been lost, but\nhave no doubt, we will win the war.\nICAFC 11-2 UMDS I ICAFC III v LSE II\nThe thirds continued a great BUSA\nrun by annihilating an LSE side from\nthe division above us. It was a solid\nfirst half performance and IC went\nahead . Andy made a dubious tackle on the LSE keeper to leave a simple tap in for Lee. The second\ngoal saw Lee scorching down the\nleft touch line, cutting inside and\nshooting it past the bewildered\nkeeper. IC continued with a solid\nperformance, especially in defence\nwith Jamie, Andy Binstead and\nMiles looking firm!\nThe second half saw two further goals from IC. Andy Bellis\ncurled one in from the left-hand\nside of the penalty box and Andy\nMurphy finished off a great break\nfrom Simon to leave 1C with a comfortable lead. Despite a late penalty to spoil Ricky's clean sheet, it\nwas another spell binding performance from the thirds. Who can\nstop us now? Who are Man Utd\nanyway?\nICAFC III 4 I LSE 1\n1\n1\nICAFC II v LSE II\nSince the injury to Captain Dan\nWaight sidelined him for most of\nthe remainder of the season, this\nmatch was \"for Dan\", in the words\nof stand-in captain Loz. We did the\nDan warm-up and then we went\nout and did him proud.\nThe match was an even contest in midfield and up front. Only\nin defence could the teams be\nseparated. Luckily this was due to\nthe fact that LSE were pants and\nLoz, Fresher Phil and Phil The Pill\nwere rock solid for IC. The first\ngoal was scored by Si after a scrambled clearance from LSE. The\nnext came from a long ball over the\ndefence beautifully put away by an\nLSE donkey, rattled by the presence of The Boy Martin and Pistol\nPete. The next was another long\nball but this time Pete saved the\ndefence the trouble of scoring,\nwalking around the keeper and\nslotting it home.\nThree-nil up at half-time and\nthe game was won so we went to\nsleep. Chris \"Scouse\" Barlow did\nus proud in goal but couldn't keep\na clean sheet. Still, we had won the\nmatch for Dan and that was what\nmattered. The seconds are indebted to Dan for whipping us into\nshape with strict discipline and\ngreat leadership. Get well soon.\nICAFC II 3 - 1 LSE II\nICAFC V v RSM II\nLast Saturday brought together\ntwo teams who's derby history\nrivals that of Manchester and\nLiverpool.There is never more than\none goal between these teams and\nso it proved in this second round\ncup tie. IC V took the lead after\ntwenty minutes when Pokki, our\nnew thai signing, played an expert\npass behind the defence for Andy\nto finish with a low shot in the bottom corner. The rest of the half\nwas very scrappy with lots of challenges thrown in from all angles\nuntil RSM II equalise d through\ntheir captain's chip. The second\nhalf was one way traffic with IC V retaining the ball throughout but\nthere seemed to be no way past\nRSM's goalkeeper. The frustration\ngrew deeper until Nick ran forty\nyards with the ball and slipped it\nthrough for Andy to score his sec-on d. The third came soon after\nwhen super sub Darren was left\nwith a simple goal following some\ngood passing. Minutes later RSM II\nprolonged the tension after some\nrubbish defending attributable to\nan anonymous player. The draw\nfor the next round is at home to\nHolloway at the start of next term.\nLet us hope for yet more glory for\nIC and the defecation of RSM into\nthe proverbial toilet bowl.\nRSM II 2 -3 ICAFC V Try, try and try again for rugby team\nICURFC Iv BLACKHEATH\nOne very hazy Saturday 18 sex\ngods and 1 sex goddess turned up\nto partake of the gentleman s sport\nof Rugby Union Football aga nist the\noldest club in the land.

But the example that may\nbe of more relevance to us is the\nanomaly of the Oxbridge tuition\nfees.\nThe Universities of Oxford and\nCambridge receive an extra \u00a32000\nper student in Government subsidy\nfor their tuition. Others such as\nExeter and Durham receive a small\nextra subsidy, since they are colle-gia te, but the amount pales into\ninsignificance compared with the\nOxbridge windfall. This is an anathema to the left-wing view, that\nthose with immense privilege and\nglittering future prospects are given\ntaxpayers' money to enhance their\nown education beyond what others\nin higher education receive.\nPerhaps students at Imperial, who\nno doubt have almost as glittering\ncareer prospects to look forward\nto, should lobby for some\nGovernment cash?\nOxbridge has a rather interesting set of excuses for their generous agreement - the usual chain of\nevents that occur when some\naugust institution finds its happily\narranged state of affairs under\nattack (the other one in the news\nrecently is the Royal Opera House).\nTheir first line of defence was that\nthe excellence of the universities\nwould be under attack, with words\nsuch as \"mutilated\" and destroyed\"\nbeing used to refer to the inevitable\nconsequences. Oxbridge students\nhave also not been slow off the\nmark in seeing their system threat-e ned. \"It seems likely that it's the\nmotivates him or her, results in a better performance in their studies.\nThe Cherwell (their equivalent to\nFelix) says in grave tones that \"the\nsheer expense of maintaining a system where students receive one to\none tuition from tutors will render\nthe arrangement impossible to sus-tain, and Oxbridge will have to turn\nto the system of lecture and seminar based degree courses practised\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nWW\nEye\nstudent who will end up footing the\nbill - although even if students do\ncome up with the cash, it may not\nbe enough\". Their Vice-Chancellor\nchipped in: \"We believe the two\ncollegiate universities to be national assets that need national support\nin order to maintain their achievements at the forefront of world\nclass teaching and research.\"\nWhat they are defending, in\nreality, is their college and tutorial\nsystem. Students are taught in\ngroups of two or three, which\nallows a much more personal style\nof teaching.

The \u00a335 million extra they\nreceive from the public comprises a minute proportion of the total budget at the universities. Complaints\nfrom smaller colleges they could be\nleft destitute or bankrupt merit little\nsympathy either: larger colleges are\nknown to take the lion's share of the\nextra subsidy, and are easily\nwealthy enough to sub sid is e the\npoorer ones - Trinity College\nCambridge (total value; \u00a3300 mil-lion) already assists smaller col-leg es. It would not be beyond the\ningenuity of Oxbridge to fill the gap\nwith other forms of funding. The\nexistence of world-class research\nand teaching at a number of other\ninstitutions, notably our own, further undermines the strength of\ntheir argument.\nThere was increasing bitterness\nin Oxford last week at the comments of an ex-bursar and the\nCollege Warden, Sir Christopher\nBall, who said that taking money\nfrom the Government was like \"tak-ing candy from a baby\". He said\nthat Oxbridge needed to be more\nhonest in its dealings with the\nGovernment. Reaction was swift\nand a little distasteful: \"These were\nunpleasant allegations from a biased source, it was not an even-sided viewpoint. ... I don't think\nthat, from the point of view of\nOxford and Cambridge, this is a very helpful story.\" In that last com-ment, at least, the don in question\nis right. Baroness Blackstone has\nnot withheld her intention to \"cor-rect\" the anomaly, and their are few\nOxbridge alumni in the Cabinetwith one major exception - Tony\nBlair. An Old Boy Network is little\nuse without the old boys.\nChancellors from other Universities\nhave been coming out of the\nwoodwork suggesting other uses\nfor the money. It seems another\n\"untouchable shrine\" of tenuously-justified public expenditure is coming to an end.\nV \u00ae 7 princes Gardens, *****\nLondon SW71NA.\n1 \\\nImperial College Sports Centre\nis the place to he seen on campus.\nEverybody wants to look go otl l You have no excuse not to, when you\nparticipate in any of the sports session\navailable.\nThe centre otters excellent rates for\n* 25 Metre Swimming pool and spa pool\n9\n4 S qi KM o': \u2022\u2022\u2022; .\u2022 ;\n.\n* Fully fci[i;;r;;^ x> fe: :\n* Saiiiw :t nd steam roo'a.:;lS f clf l:.*,.....J..;;; \u00a5\nS||J:; go\nBring this Advert to the Sports Centre recep tio i and claim your free Sauna session.\n('\u2022'.'\u2022:\u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,!\u00ab.\u2022 \u2022...-.:..v. cS/fSM ro "
