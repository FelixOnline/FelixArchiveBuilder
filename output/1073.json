    "content": "10 NEWS FEATURE FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER A rower or a rugby player - who would you like to unwrap?\nMany women are absolutely fascinated and completely hooked on rugby\nand rowing. The sheer athletic is m and highly physical nature of these sports\nhave most definitely prolonged this fascination.\nThe rugby teams have the physical consistency of a Reubens nude paint-ing. The rowers clearly have the bodies of some of Michealangelo's most\ninteresting paintings; due to their well honed bod s, long lithe legs and great\nteeth. They arc simply Britain's answer to the surfer-beach boy. In short the\nrowers arc certainly \"pretty boys.\"\nMeanwhile, the rugby team are not a pretty sight - this is probably due to\nthe excessive consumption of Union curries and barrels of beer. Regardless\nof this fact the rugby boys have cheeky, great, big walloping thighs and a personality overload. Hence a photographer and 1 went to watch the IC\nrugby firsts play St Georges medics last Wednesday. I had expected the IC\nrug ger boys to be beer-bellied misogynist Neanderthals who would sooner\neat a female jour no than speak to her. Instead they were human and almost\ngentlemanly.\nThe weather j# as bitingly cold and the playing field was a potential swamp.\nThe match was simply watching thirty men if du lge in rou j jji, f&'t in dj pteron e driven wrestling and running; it was great ! By the end of the game I had developed an acute understanding of the rugby psyche. Basically they\nplay a grimy, dirty and sometimes pain full) physical game; this explains\nwhy their social life is grimy, dirty, and joyfully physical. The sordid rugby\n\"sex anthems\" reflect the kind of attitude needed for such a gruelling game.\nIn reality the IC men's rugby team admitted to worshipping at the alter of\nthe IC Virgins (women's rugby team), and were serious exponents of\nwomen's rugby.\nAt the dawn of 1997, is there any\ngoodwill between the women and\nmen of Imperial?\nAfua Osei investigates the state of\naffairs between the Sexes (opposite\npage), and explores the IC man's sporting talent (this page).\nOriginally I had intended to literally investigate the IC male sporting talent by\ngetting good shots of them in the showers; with as one rugby player politely\nsaid \"tinsel around their tod gers.\" The rowers were extremely enthusiastic,\nabout flaunting themselves to satisfy the female population, but due to the\nrowing boys' timing being Off last week, we were unable to lias e with them\non the photographic front. We did take some shots of the rugby players in the\nshowers but unfortunately the camera lenses steamed up. Although do not\ndespair, if there is sufficient demand I will most definitely pursue this assign-ment.\nTo help you decide who to unwrap on Christmas morning, the cream of IC's sporting talent have kindly given us a few words of wisdom:\nThe rowing boys insist that they arc fit, last forever, and have impressively\nlarge protruding organs, while the rugby team state that the rowers \"can't get\nit up after two pints\" and are too tall to fit under the mistletoe.\nHmm, tricky one. You decide.\nFELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER NEWS FEATURE 11\nImperial College Male:Female Public Relations\nOut on the streets that constitute Imperial College's campus, the wild groups of predatory men and women stalk one another. But, trapped and with opinions\nsquirmed out of them, what do the les hommes et les femme s of IC think of each other?\nThe bois trou s men seem to think that Imperial women are far too studious. A common jibe is that many good-looking women are too prudish, extremely\narrogant and unapproachable.\nBut arc these men just intimidated by the powers of female intellect and sexuality?\nPerhaps not; others responded more positively:\n\"There arc a lot of foreign women at Imperial, and they have a great sense of style\"\n'They are very tasty and I could eat them all\"\nOne response which provoked great hilarity was this gem: \"Imperial College should pass a resolution banning women from having any morals or any\nboyfriends. This is to enable IC women to adequately satisfy the huge male population\" When asked about emotions and feelings, this IC man proclaimed that\n\"You can feel for them on the night\" A rubber blow-up doll was suggested as another solution to his problem, but the interviewee insisted that he already had\none! Elsewhere, another extremely lonely and frustrated man whined that he was unable to find anyone at IC with \"A massive chest and long legs.\" In this\ninstance a pair of melons from Sainsburys would probably better suit this gentleman, because he obviously feels more comfortable with inanimate objects,\nrather than females of the human species!\nOn the other side of the gender divide, the disappointed women felt that IC men are, in summary:\n\u2022 Lf f\\g JI4* \u00bb I?v3 M \u00bb| 1\n0 v*I^\\)m. JL\nSad and scrawny\n\"Nerdy and hideous\"\n\"Similar to an array of volcanic pimples\"\nAnd to seal the evolutionary death knell for the Imperial College man, a female Cambridge student visiting our union happily guaranteed that the male talent\nwas better back there.\nDespite these reactions, it seems that underneath all the bluff, Imperial men and women have a huge adoration and appreciation of each other, which they will\nonly confess to when gently coaxed. It also seems unbelievable that Imperial women feel that there are no decent men. Is it possible that they are being over\nselective...?\nEitherway, after scouting the imperial campus for seven hours - we have found a sea of gorgeous kiss able men for your mistletoe. They're out there some-where, happy hunting!\n\n"

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER General Election to be held over Easter holidays\nNEWS TEAM Tory MPs from more than a dozen\nmarginal constituencies are believed\nto be swaying John Major's decision\nover the date of the next General\nElection. These MPs are in constituencies which contain a relatively\nhigh percentage of students. They\nfear that most students will vote\nLabour in the next election, so they\nfeel that it is in the best interests of\nthem and their party if the election is\nheld during the Easter vacation,\nwhen most students have gone home\nfor the holidays. Many party strategists see April 10th as the most likely date, and the Prime Minister himself has said that the Government\nmay be forced to go to the polls\nbefore the pencilled-in date of May\n1st. The majorities of Tory MPs in\nseats such as Luton, Coventry,\nPortsmouth, Oxford and Exeter are\nonly a few hundred, and with over\nten thousand students in their constituencies they believe that the date\nof the election could substantially\ninfluence their chances of re-ele c tion. Some are already aware that\nthey only secured their tiny majorities in 1992 because the election was\nheld on April 9th. On the other hand,\nsome Conservative MPs lost their\nseats in 1992 when students made a group decision to vote by post in\nareas such as Bath, York, and\nCambridge.\nA senior Tory spokesman made\nthe position clear. \"If we manage to\nhave not just polling day but also\nmost of the campaign during the hol-i days, we have increased our chances\nof holding those seats.\" With the\ngovernment majority at the last election a mere twenty-two, then clearly\nthese dozen constituencies were crucial to determining the government\nof the country over the last four\nyears.\nLabour strategists are believed to\nbe mobil ising in preparation for an\nApril election, and are campaigning\nto persuade students to register to\nvote. Furthermore, a group of more\nthan 6000 Labour students are running a campaign to show members\nhow to use postal votes, so that\nwhenever the election is called they\ncan vote wherever they feel their\nvote will be most useful. Their\nleader, Ruth Potter, said \"If the\nTories go for April, they will have an\nadvantage because students tend to\nvote Labour. But we are working\nhard in our campaign.\" One Tory in\na marginal seat commented \"It is a bit of a dated concept that all students are left-wing\".\nUnsurprisingly, Kensington and\nChelsea is not one of those constituencies said to be at risk from the\nhotbed of left-wing extremism that is\nIC. Despite the turmoil that has\nAUT CONDEMN PAY OFFER\nThe Association of University\nTeachers has condemned the 5%\nover two years increase in pay they\nwere offered, dismissing it as \"total-ly inadequate.\" David Triesman,\nGeneral Secretary of the AUT, said\n\"All HE unions were united in rejecting this...Taken as a package this\noffer is actually worse than the last.\nMembers will be very angry indeed.\"\nThis means that the dispute will\nprobably become more disruptive,\nwith the threat of further strike\naction. The AUT have expressed\npleasure that the employers are\nshowing willingness to discuss the\nmatter, but, as Mr Triesman points\nout, \"Real negotiations are needed\nurgently.\"\nWILSON HOUSE\nAfter months of negotiations\nbetween College and St Mary's Student Union, College has finally\nagreed to fund part of the cost of\nrefurbishing the bar in the\nRecreational Centre at Wilson\nHouse. The work is expected to be\ncompleted by the start of next term.\nAs well as being used as a sport\ncentre and an examination hall, the\nRecreational Centre also stages the\nannual musical productions by the St\nMary's Hospital Opera Society and\nthe Medics' Soiree. At the moment,\nthe bar is only ever opened on such\noccasions. After the refurbishments,\nwhich will include the addition of a table-tennis table, it is expected to be\nused as a place for club meetings and\nprivate study. The Warden, Dr Bryan\nClarke, hopes that residents will\nmake full use of the new facilities to\njustify the investments made by\nCollege.\nrecently surrounded the local Tory\nparty with the de selection of Sir\nNicholas Scott, this remains one of\nthe safest Conservative seats in the\ncountry.\nAlthough the effects of students all\nvoting from home are hard to predict,\nit seems clear that the election date\ncould prove crucial to the outcome of\nthe 1997 General Election.

It is even theoretically possible that Magnus\ncould one day be taught to walk and\ntalk.\nTOXIC PAINT\nA more accurate method for testing\nfor toxic metals in paint has been\ndeveloped by Imperial College's Centre for Analytical Research in\nEnvironment in Berkshire. The new\ntechnique, known as neutron activation analysis, or NAA, will be able to\nprovide a reference against which\npaint toxicity can be calculated.\nThis technique could have applications in the toy manufacturing\nindustry, where toxicity levels in\npaint have to be regulated. Because\nNAA is highly accurate, the EU are\ndemanding that this system should\nbe used to set the standard. Paint\ncontains cadmium, mercury, barium,\nchromium and small amounts of\narsenic. The upper limits on the\nquantities of these potentially lethal\nelements must by law be carefully\ncontrolled.\nLECTURERS\nA recent national survey of university lecturers was published in the\nGuardian last week. Among those\nwho took part in the survey, 9% of\nlecturers confessed themselves to be\nalcoholics, 23% were clinically\ndepressed, and 60% expressed a desire to leave.\nSi;\nARE YOU EASILY\nU Office before\nThursday to register.\nNews in Brief\n\n"

Also in disagreement are the staff of the\nmedical center in Princes\nGardens, who are threatening\nstrike action over the increased\nworkload.\nThe Registry Department\nclaim they have the full backing\nof the Rector, and remain confident that their scheme will soon\nbecome an integral part of the\nadmissions procedure. \"Our\nultimate aim is for everyone to\nbe able to go down to the\nUnion bar and\npull,\" said a happy,\nnewly engaged researcher.\nCold turkey for\ncuny addicts\ncontinued from page J only feasible explain ation was\nthat the whole lunch operation\nwas merely a front for a vast\nnarcotics ring.\"\nSure enough, forensic analysis showed traces of crack\ncocaine in the pork bi ryan i.

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER Wujiy\nii jy bi j jgf e Westminster Eye- Hamish Common\np.; ij This time it's my\nI local MP that's in\nW' thc hot wat er.\nDavid Willetts, MP for Havant, has\nresigned as Paymaster-General amid\nmore sleaze and intrigue, with predictable reactions: Labour's Deputy\nLeader, John Prcscott, along with.\nLynne Armstrong, Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for\nHavant would even like him to resign\nand fight a by-election! Thc\nGuardian jumped on the sleaze bandwagon with gusto, devoting as much\nspace to a character assassination of\nMr Willctts as it did to Dunblane thc\nday after thc massacre .\nThc background to this sorry state\nlies with the relationship between\nNeil Hamilton and Ian Greer.\nHamilton, a former minister, has\nbeen accused of several parliamentary crimes, including payments for\nasking questions in the House, dod gy stays in thc Ritz and murky dealings\nwith a lobbyist. To cap it all, he proceeded to sue the Guardian for libel,\nand mysteriously dropped the case\nthc day before thc trial began. Into\nthis delightful scenario stepped\nDavid Willetts, who was a junior\nwhip when the now defunct\nCommons Committee on Members'\nInterests was investigating Neil\nHamilton. The only evidence against\nWilletts was a hand-written memo to\nthe Chief Whip about what to do\nwith the Committee investigating\nHamilton. \".. .[The committee chair-man] is now expecting to receive a formal complaint about Hamilton\nreceiving money etc. He could (i) argue now sub jud ice and get [the]\ncommittee to set it aside; or (ii)\ninvestigate as quickly as possible,\nexploiting good Tory majority at\n| once]\" Willetts freely concedes that\nthis was a poor example a whip's note, containing to much of what he\nthought and too little of what he said.\nAs a junior whip he would have been\ntrying to impress his seniors by\ndrama ti sing accounts of conversations. The new Committee on\nStandards and Privileges decided that\nthc evidence he gave to thc previous\ncommittee was inconsistent in its\nown right and with Sir Geoffrey\nJohnson Smith, thc previous committee chairman. \"We cannot accept\nmuch of thc memorandum submitted\nby Mr Willetts, nor much of his oral\nevidence, as being accurate. ...We arc\nvery concerned that any Member\nshould dissemble in his account to\nthe committee and believe this\nresponse has substantially aggravated the original offence. We have\ndecided that in any future investigation of matters of privilege or of\ncomplaints about the conduct of\nMembers, it will be our normal practice to take evidence on oath.\"\nThc committee concluded that\nWilletts had sought to influence the\noutcome of thc Interests\nCommittee's decision on Hamilton,\non the evidence of the hand-written\nnote and Willctts' economy with thc\ntruth. It assumed that the note was an\naccurate record of thc conversation,\nthat Sir Geoffrey should not have\nbeen talking to him, and that Willetts\nlied before the committee. Such a damning indictment in these times\ncould only lead to Willetts' resign a tion, which he did with a speed and\ngrace which improves his chances of\nre-appearing on the front benches at\nsome stage in the future.\nMost politicians agree that Willetts\nwas brought to book less for what he\ndid than that he was a victim of his\nown naivet e. He was made a whip\nafter a short time in the Commons\nbecause although his ability was\nobvious, he needed some exposure to\nthe rougher aspects of political horse-play. His previous career had consisted of time in the Number 10 Policy\nUnit, and then as head of the Centre\nfor Political Studies. With such a background and intelligence (he was\nknown as Two-Brains) it was natural\nhe would undergo rapid promotion.\nAfter four years in Parliament, he\nwas the first of his intake to become\na Minister of State. Such a career\npath attracted jealousy from his col-leagues, and there were few tears\nshed when thc whiff of scandal rose\naround him. It seems the Standards\nand Privileges Committee were not\nimmune to this. The committee had\njust been created after thc Nolan\nreport, and it felt that the public's faith in thc parliamentary process\nwould only be maintained if it\naccomplished its duties with unanimity and force. It consisted of a hot ch pot ch of embittered Tories and\nLabour MPs intent on party political\nadvantage. It had already leaked\ninformation, and especially in the\nclosing stages of the proceedings it\nseemed to be driven by partisan con-side rations. The most obvious case of\nthis was Quentin Davies, a talented\nTory MP who has never had the\nappointments or publicity that\nWilletts had. His scorching cross-examination shocked many Tories,\nand his scrutiny of the text on a two-year old quickly-written note was\nunprecedented.\nIt is saddening that a career built built\nup over many years has fallen victim\nto the jaundiced mood of the\nCommons today, but Mr Willctts\nmay be one of thc few former ministers who could be in a position to salvage his career. The Committee on\nStandards and Privileges has passed\nits first test in the public eye, and it\nseems the Tories have forgiven Mr\nWilletts for his indiscretions. How\nlong it will take them to forgive Mr\nDavies is unclear.\nDon't forget to pick up some of the\ngreat Christmas giveaways in this\nweek's issue of Something for the\nWeekend.\nThe Weekly Poem\nby PoetIC\nLeaf Relief\nFollowing a gentle arc,\nThe river-path among trees\nWhose shimmering leaves and dappled bark\nPut my restless mind at ease.\nThe all absorbing masquerade,\nOf London's dark and guarded blot\nIs held worthless in this leafy shade\nWhere my city life is soon forgot.\nSo when I walk with unbalanced gait\nAnd there's chaos in my personal space,\nI saunter here to put things straight\nAnd let the real world touch my face.\nby Nick Reeve, October 96\nPoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College, for more details of\nour meeting times contact Keith McNulty on ext 58610 or via\nk. mcnulty@ ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER SPORT 19\nIC rugby : down but not out\nGARETH WILLIAMS\nFELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT\nIC's Gutteridge Cup run came to a halt against the medics of St\nGeorges. An explosive first five minutes saw tries scored by both teams,\nwith Andy Mayes replying to St\nGeorges opening salvo. After the\nopening frenetic burst IC had their\nbacks to the wall, and despite some\ncourageous tackling were unable to\nprevent St Georges stretching out a healthy lead before half-time.\nAfter the break, IC raised their\ngame and came storming back at St\nGeorges. Debutants Kolone Yung\nand Matt Fogerty putting in impressive performances. Dan Doherty was\nhis normal fiery self, and Martin\nByre fancied himself as a fly-half -though surely without the kicking\nskills.\nThe two heavyweights Geoff\nMillet and Rob Gare beefed up the\nscrum with Jasper Hyde and Matt\nAnstead combining well in the line-out. Number 8 Paul Hardcastle\ncapped a good performance by\ncrashing over the line from a tap\npenalty.\nFor the backs, Chris Mutter and\nDave Gol formed a solid pairing in\nthe centre, showing touches of real\nclass. Dave Chatterji was like a whippet behind the forwards, forming a smooth link to silky skills out-side-half Gareth Williams.\nPersistent IC pressure resulted in a further try for grease lightning\nwinger Maru Woodhouse.\nUnfortunately it was not quite to be,\nas the first half deficit proved just a mite too difficult to overcome.\nHowever, it was still a brave effort,\nwith IC hampered by the absence of\nJack Peart and Oily Littleton to\nULU.\nOur last fixture of the year is the\nChristmas dinner, when we will be\nlooking forward to 1997. IC seem\nwell placed for a successful campaign in the new year, which could\nwell prove to be one of our most successful for some time.\nFourths humiliate UMD S Obviously from start to finish IC\ndominated this game, to such an\nextent that the 7-1 score- line flattered\nthe UMDS. Individual performance\nof the match must go to Sion Hale\nwho scored a stunning hat4 rick. The\nfirst was a penalty following a foul on\nDmitri, then a well taken tap in, but\nthe highlight was his third, a spin-ning, curling shot from the right wing\ninto the top corner. Not bad for a left\nback totally out of position!\nThe other goals were scored by\nChris, direct form a corner, two from\nRyan, including an excellent glancing\nheader and an own goal created by\nDmitri. For the second time in two\nmatches Adam hit an unstoppable\nshot onto the left-hand pest, and again\nplayed supremely well in the centre\nof midfield. His play deserved a goal\nand it is a great shame he missed a last minute penalty.\nWe had shots inches wide, shots\nwhich hit the cross-bar, and two\nheaders from only yards out when it\nseemed easier to score than miss. All\nin all IC were unstoppable. At the\nha ff time stage in the season we are in\na great position to win promotion,\nand having qualified for the National\nStages of BUSA this has the makings\nof a famous season for the Fourths.\nIn this match report I really wanted\nto write about a Hitleresque ref showing as little compassion as the ICU\nstewards, but the ref was fine, unlike\nthe power crazy stewards who continue to operate a harsh regime where\ninnocent people are made scapegoats\nfor more serious offences. It really\nneeds to be sorted out, but for now\nnever mind since we're only students\nand we don't matter.\nRS M leave the rest behind\nFollowing the news that our closest\nrival Gold II have now lost a game\nand draw one, the RSM had an\nopportunity to move 5 points clear at\nthe top. Although starting early, we\nstill managed to arrive late at the\nground of Royal Vets due to some\ngood co-piloting by Roger and Si.\nThere were a couple of big changes\nin the team this time around. Seeing\nthat Swedish strikers are renowned\nfor their composure in the box,\nsomething the Scotland-Sweden\ngame bears witness to, we played\nMagnus H. up front. After about 5-minutes a corner was driven long to\nthe back post were Neil headed it\nback into the danger area. Now\nsomething incredible happened,\nsomething that will be discussed (at\nevery opportunity!) in the RSM\nhalls. From out of nowhere Fredrik\nstep up to calmly place the ball past\nat least 8 players + the goalie. His\nfirst goal for RSM, surely many to\ncome. The rest of the half saw RSM\nagain having virtually all the possession but not being able to convert it\ninto goals. Michel produced a bit of\nmagic when he left 3 defenders for\ndead. The second half saw the game\nproceed in similar fashion. Keith\ncome close with a shoot that struck\nthe post. Si was brought on when\nabout 20 minutes remained. He\nquickly got control of the ball inside\nthe box and calmly placed his shoot\nin the corner. The two Swedes,\nMagnus H and Magnus W, interconnected well down the right leading to\na deep cross to the left which Si easily headed inn from the tightest of\nangles. It seemed we would be\nrewarded a penalty when Michel was\n\"hacked\" own in the box. The referee seemed less convinced and let\nplay continue. The result of this negligence was booed by the spectators\nsimilar to the McDonalds add. The\nopposition must be commended for\ntheir commitment, although some of\ntheir tackles were reckless. Still a comfortable 3-0 victory.\nLondon six-pack sees IC Sailing\nClub triumphant\nAt the recently held London Six\nPack, IC Sailing Club tried out their\nnew and improved team for 1996-97.\nHosted by the University of London\non our home water, the event is one\nof the premiere university team racing competitions in the sailing cale n dar. IC, having put together a. team\nnot three days before, went into the\nevent looking to gain experience for\nthe forthcoming qualifiers and the\nBritish University Sports\nAssociation (BUSA) nationals.\nThe first day's racing was blessed\nwith a good force three breeze which\ncarried the boys through three consecutive victories over strong teams\nrepresenting Cambridge, London\nand Oxford Ladies. This brought\nsmiles to Imperial faces especially as\nthe University of London were to be\nbeaten by only one other team.\nLunch brought a change in for-tunes, and the lack of experience\nshowed as IC conceded some narrow\nlosses to some very good university\nteams. Despite two wins at the end of\nthe day IC were eliminated from the\nfinals.\nSunday racing continued throughout the day with most sailors feeling\nsomewhat fragile from the previous\nnights festivities (including fireworks and bonfires!!).\nThe eventual winners were\n\"Castaways\" an ex-London boys\nteam who showed their experience\nby not losing a match throughout the\nentire weekend.\nRESULTS\nRUGBY IC2 ND1224 CHARRING CROSS SNOOKER IC CHRISTMAS OPEN FINAL SIMON BA UGH32 RUSSELL TOWERS FOOTBALL I C1ST10 GOLDSMITH'Sl STIC2 ND11I C3R DIC3 RD21 ROYAL HOLLOWAY4 THI C3R D02R S MIC4 TH71 UMD S2 ND IC5T H44RS M2N DIC6 TH15 LSE6 THR SM30 ROYAL VETS "

Mais turn, for here i shall present to you, dear reader, my\ntop tips for the perfect tele visual Crimbo. And, as they say, what a Christmas line-up it is too. In all hon-est y, this i:; the'best for many yeses,\npartly because someone c in d><< JTV that there ::is on if t quai i a eek \u2022\n\u2022\nbra hon at (lie end of December, a fact\nor iii tr cc from their diaries last, year\nStarting with films, it's hard lo know\nwhere to begin. As you gro h ably know by now, Jurassic Park\n(BBCi, The B.e m tim of the Day iT Vi10:00p m) are the\nbig h lie ' ,. \u2022\nunusually has the largest number of\nmust-sees , including The Wizard of\nOz (BBCI, 11:20am), Revenge of\nthe Pink Panther (BBC 1, mid nigh l) and Casablanca (BBC2, 3:10pm) ii\nyou haven't seen the latter and tail to\nwatch it this year, I shall personally\nsend the boys round to ask why. The\nMonday before has the brilliant My\nLeft Foot (C4, 10:05pm), the sole\nhighlight of the day, but Christmas\nEve does better with Cliffhangcr\n(BBCI, 9:00pm), the old faithful\nTop Gun (1TV,9:45 pm), Blazing\nSaddles (BBC2,10:00pm) and Drop\nDead Fred (C4, 6:45p m).I'm sorry,\nthe last one is a terrible error, Vicmy nuclear strength Nurofen have\njust kicked in.\nBond fans are not to be disappoint-ed; Never Say Never Again (BBCI,\nBoxing Day, 1:50pm) and, slightly\nunderrated, The Living Daylights\nKlfV, 29th,8:00 pm). As well as\nClouscau, Peter Sellers gets a bit of a season this Christmas, with three of\nhis other films- The Battle of the\nSexes (C4, Christmas Day, 6:50pm), the brilliant send-up of trade unionism I'm All Right Jack (C4, New\nYear's Day, 5:05pm) and the incomparable Dr Strangelove (C4, 2n d,12:25am). Incidentally, The Man\nwith two Brains (C4, 27th,10:00 pm), which always, bi/.ar rely, reminds me of Dr Strangelovc is well\nworth a look.\nDiehard Felix readers will remember\nlast Christmas when 1 waxed lyrical\nabout The Italian Job. This is without doubt on of the funniest caper\nfilms ever made, completely timeless\nand beautifully cast with Michael\nCaine opposite the redoubtable Noel\nCoward. If I feared that it wasn't on\nthis year, not being in its regular\nChristmas Eve slot, but am delighted\nto say that it is on Boxing Day\n(BBC2, 4.25pm). What's more, The\nIn r roc cp' ilo^ RRn IK th Id nj m\"! and Louise (BBCI, 3th,10:20 pm), Die Hard (ITV, New Year's Day,\n9:00pm), ET (BBC1, New Year's Day, 6:10pm), The Birds (BBCI,\nChristmas Eve, 12:50am), The\nGraduate (BBCI, Boxing Day,\n12:05am), Grease (BBCI, 27th.2:55 pm), Raiders of the Lost Ark\n(BBCI, 22nd,8:00 pm) and\nShadowlands (BBCI, New Year's Eve, so video, 8:00pm). There are\nalso a couple of Carry on films\n(Girls , Matron and Cowboy) and a few from-TV movies, normally, not\nto be touched with a barge pole, but\nPorridge (BBCI, New Year's Day,\n2.00pm) is just about the exception to\nthe rule.\n\"Normal\" output has not been\nneglected this year, with the BBC the\nclear winner as it has been since the\ndawn of time. Christmas specials are\nin abundance, the best being They\nThink It's all Over (BBCI, 23rd,10.00 pm), Father Ted (C4,\nChristmas Eve, 10:00pm), One Foot\nin the Grave (BBCI, Boxing Day.\n9:00pm), The Brittas Empire\n(BBCI, Christmas Eve, 6:30pm), The Fast Show (BBC2, 27th,9:40 pm) and Shooting Stars (BBC2,\n27th,(9:00 pm). First and foremost\nhowever, is the three-part Only\nFools and Horses special (BBCI,\nstarting Christmas Day, 9:00pm), which may, apparently, be their last,\nalthough Del Boy has had more\nretirements than Frank Sinatra. It\nshould certainly be the highlight of\nAuntie's schedule, and alone constitutes more watch abl c comedy than\nAs the more astute of you may have\ngleaned i rom my column, I am a bit\nof a traditionalist.

    "content": "6 NEWS REVIEW FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER Autumn Term Do you remember...\nISSUE1063... When library users had a lucky\nescape as bits of concrete started\nfalling just inches from unsuspecting\nstudents. The library was in the middle of building work that would add\ntwo extra storeys and extend the\nground floor.\nJust hours before Felix went to\npress, a four ton lump of concrete fell\nfrom the ceiling of the walkway just\noutside the library entrance. Nearby\nworkmen observed that \"it would\ndefinitely have killed anyone underneath it.\" Mr Ian Gillet confirmed\nthat nobody had been injured but nervously joked that someone had \"felt a draught down the back of his neck as\nit fell.\"\nThe incident prompted an investigation into safety on the various construction projects around campus but\nunfortunately was not the last to\nbefall work on the campus.\nOn a brighter note for construction\nwork, the Union saw the transformation of its Ents Lounge into the\nglittering spectacle of dBs, the culmination of two years of strategic plan-ning. The \u00a30.1 million project\ndesigned by the College's CAD\nOffice just made its building schedule in time for the grand opening.\nEvents and Marketing Manager\nMark Home, commented that the old\nEnts Lounge had been like \"a sixth\nform disco\" and looked forward to\ngetting the crowds in. A term's worth\nof usage seems to have bom e out stu-dents' initial impressions that it was a significant improvement on the old\n\"dark blue box,\"wi fh the room being\npacked most lunchtimes and on ents\nnights.\nThe entertainment front was also\ngiven the boost by the news that\nImperial College Union was one of\nthe few in the country to serve\nGuinness after NUS Services Ltd,\nthe group that supplies all NUS affiliated unions, fell out with the comp a ny. Regulars in the Union Bar looked\nsmug in their newly privileged pos i tion.\nSmugness radiated elsewhere too\nas Imperial's Boat Club triumphed\nagain, this time at Henley. In a round\nup of the summer sport, Felix reported an elated rowing team scooping\nthe Grand at Henley for the first time\nin the club's history.\nISSUE1064 The University of London Union's year got off to a bad start as they\nlost one of their sabbatical officers\nbefore term even started. Claire\nLawrie, a former LSE student who\nheld the position of Deputy President\nfor Finance and Services for approximately one month before resigning\ndue to \"family problems.\"\nThe UL U President, Sarah White,\nsometime President of ICU, assured\nmembers of the Union that \"... the\nservice that we provide has not been\naffected.\" However, the ULU stall at\nICU's Freshers' Fair seemed to be\nsomewhat disorganised, with Ms\nWhite scurrying around due to a late\ndelivery.\nMeanwhile, back at UL U central,\nthe papers went up for nominations\nfor the sabbatical post. By the close\nof nominations, only two people\nwere fully seconded, Nick Dearden,\nan MSc student from LSE, and Ben\nHughes from Royal Holloway. Mr\nDearden turned up at ICU to advise\nour sabbaticals which way to vote, a clear breach of UL U election rules.\nNaughty boy.\nCloser to home, the Royal\nGeographical Society unknowingly\nhosted a stripper at the City and\nGuilds Union's fresher s' reception.\nThe stage show, organised as a simple publicity stunt by the C& GU,\nbarely raised a murmur around\nCollege, though one of the College\nTutors, Dr Gareth Jones, commented\nthat he was \"very disturbed to hear\nthat it happened.\"\nThe RGS were less than amused,\nand threatened never to allow another Union event on their premises.\nICU President Eric Allsop suggested\nto Guilds that it probably wasn't such\na good idea but conceded \"that how\nthey present themselves to the student body is ultimately their dec i sion.\"\nISSUE1065 Sadness over closure of 'excellent'\nMontpellier Hall headed the front\npage story of issue 1065.\nMontpellier, the last of College's post grad only halls, has been earmarked for closure in September\n1997, with the loss of 75 beds. Senior\nacademics questioned the decision,\nvoicing concern over the priority of\npostgraduate accommodation.\nThe decision to close the Hall was\ntaken by College's Management\nPlanning Group, in view that it could\nnot really postponed much longer.\nThe Hall faces a renovation bill of\n\u00a3600,000. Not everyone was happy\nwith the closure, however. Dr\nRichard Clark, warden of the Hall,\n\"expressed sadness\" at the decision,\nat that it would be \"a great loss.\"\nBack to the antics at UL U, the\nelection for the vacant Finance and\nServices sabbatical took place. Nick\nDearden, favourite of the previous\nincumbent, won convincingly despite\nworries over a pre-campaign interview he gave to Felix the previous\nweek. The interview went against\nUL U electoral regulations, but, luckily for Mr Dearden, the Elections\nCommittee chose not to prohibit his\nnomination.\nThe \"casual ballistics\" of a drunken Southside guest were considered lucky not to have injured\nsomeone after one a \"friend-of-a friend\" of a Southside resident threw\na full can of beer off the roof of the\nHall. The can arched gracefully into\nthe lounge window of a mews house\nbehind the Hall. The resident was not\npleased, and somewhat shocked, but\nstill magn amino us ly conceded that\n\"we were all students once.\" The\nSouthside student was not quite so\nlucky and faced a disciplinary\nResidences Tribunal.\nISSUE1066 At the start of a recurring theme,\nClayponds' security came under\nthe spotlight. \" A spate of crime at\nClayponds, the College's South\nEaling residential estate, has been at\nthe centre of rising complaints of\n'inadequate' security at the site\"\nbegan the article, pointing out that\nthe current rate of one theft every ten\ndays was quite appalling. After an\ninitial spat over figures, with some\nCollege authorities claiming that\nthere had been no break-ins for four\nweeks, the debate, carried out in the\nmedium of Felix's letters page began\nto centre on the proposed security\nmeasures.\nStudents wanted deadlocks, the\nCollege said that it couldn't afford\nthem without upping the rents. The\nstudents wanted deadlocks, as recommended by local crime prevention\nofficers. The College installed a \"man and his dog\", who stayed, in\nthe main, in his van. The students\nwanted deadlocks and bars, \"We\nwouldn't mind it looking like\nAlcatraz if we got to keep our stuff.\"\nsaid one. The College installed some\ncarpets instead, at cost of \u00a3163,170\n(including VAT) and sent round a questionnaire. The survey revealed\nthat the students were not prepared to\npay extra rent for extra security.\nAnother theme that kept popping\nup during the term, again connected\nto money, was the threat by the\nAssociation of University Teachers\nand other higher education unions\nto strike over their 1.5% pay offer.\nAt this stage, the unions were balloting their members, but the result was\nwidely predicted to be a un an amino us 'yes', which would\nherald the \"first wide scale industrial\naction in HE for ten years.\" David\nTreisman, General Secretary of the\nAUT summed up the employees feelings \"All groups in the public sector\nhave had to deal with an effective pay\nfreeze over the last two or three\nyears, but university staff have been\nout ting up with one for fifteen.\"\nThe NUS immediately pledged to\nsupport any strike, whereas ICU\nwere slightly more reserved in their\nsupport. \"The AUT have a perfectly\nvalid protest, and so we'd like to\nback them on this issue. However,\n\n"

Not, as\nyou might think, in an attempt to\nwoo their vote, but rather in a desperate scramble to foist these potentially anti-conservative electors off\non some safer MP and away from\ntheir own fragile majorities. The theory is that around Easter, when most\nstudents are on vacation and no\nlonger concentrated in large num-be rs, the effects of their supposedly\nleft-wing vote will be diluted and\nConservative MPs with a small\nmajority will be saved from defeat.\nI bet students have never realised\nthat they instill such fear in MPs\nbeyond that which a great unwashed\nmob generates when they threaten a prim to ff. However, it is a shame that\nthe effect of most students will be, if\nyou excuse the pun, marginal on the\nfates of MPs sitting on small major i ties. Unless, of course, large groups\nof students choose to use postal their\nvote all in one constituency as the\nNUS is pushing for. I must say that\nthis sounds faintly undemocratic, but\nthe thought of MPs cowering before\na few students is quite amusing.\nCloser to the campus, the Rock the\nVote wagon has slowly been lurching around London, even pausing to\npick up a few completed voter registration cards from our own JCR. But\nan even better wheeze has been\ndreamt up by some publicity wag -the Spice Girls are to stand for the\nsoon to be vacant seat of Kensington\n& Chelsea, or so reports last week's Sun. This would, no doubt, cause a bit of surge in the turnout for this\nconstituency as students rushed to\ncast their votes for their favourite\nbrand of Spice. Just think - with the\nglamourous pouting five some on on\nthe podium with the spectacled and\nsuited, for some the the choice would\nalready be made. But don't forget\nhow broad their appeal could be;\nwith the Girls claiming Mrs Thatcher\nas one of their heroines, they might\njust appeal to that other group whose\nvote certain a Tory MP cannot\ndepend upon - the Kensington &\nChelsea Conservative Party. Sir\nNicholas, not being adverse to a bit\nof 'spice' himself, would be grinning\nall the way to the ballot box.\nLastly, it has come to my attention\nthat a bizarre global celebration is\ncoming up.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER Engineering Fears\nNEWS TEAM The Engineering council has\nannounced future plans for tougher\nentry standards for engineering\ndegrees. The report, known as SARTOR '96, suggests candidates should\nhave 24 points or over at A levels to\nstudy for MEng degrees, 18 for\nBEng (Hons), and 6 points for a BEng. There are 10 points for an A level grade A,8 for aB,6 for aC, and so on.\nSeveral university heads slammed\nthis approach as being \"elitist\" and\ndescribed it as a threat to the prof es sion. One pointed out that \"there was\nvery little correlation\" between A level grades of students studying\ncourses and their final degrees.\nThe report recommends \"fewer\nand better chartered engineers and\nmore and better incorporated engi-ne ers.\" The four year MEng meets\nthe criteria needed for registration as\na chartered engineer. The BEng\ndegree course could end up being re-registered as an Incorporated\nEngineering degree, or IEng. The\nEngineering Council has plans to\npromote these courses. A spokesman, Robin Bond, said that\n\"those gaining IEng will not be seen\nas failed chartered engineers. By\nhaving a degree specially for the\nincorporated rank, we are emphasising the importance of the practical\napproach to the profession.\"\nVice-Chancellors are concerned\nthat a low proportion of institutions\noffering engineering courses will be\nable to ask for candidates to have the\nhigh grades the MEng degrees would\nrequire, with some institutions being\nforced to drop engineering.\nPostgraduate loans\ncontinued from front page\nmitte e General Secretary John Gray\nphrases it, may well not end up being\nvery profitable to the students. Not\nonly does this plan elude-the real\nproblem of Higher Education fund-ing, but, apart from one-year vocational students for whom this plan\nmay come in handy, most sus cri bing to this plan will find that, despite the\npreferential terms, this loan can turn\nout to be a time bomb ready to detonate at the end of their three years of\npostgraduate study. In any case, this\nplan does not modify the intrinsically\nmorose situation of postgraduate\neducation. For this plan to be seen as\na real encouragement, the students\nwould need to be, as Mr Gray puts it,\n\"pretty confident they will get\nstraight into a big money job\", which\nis unlikely to be the case for most.\ni \u2022i xv lift *\u00bb'*k \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\ntls lii iS S iii asK at 1\nPHOTO: ALDOUS The Christmas spirit finally made to some parts of the campus, as a cheery Santa visits the cleaners of the Blackett Laboratory. He's making\na list, checking it twice, he's going to find out who's naughty or nice...\nPolys above Oxbridge in citations index\nNEWS TEAM New light has been shed on the\n\"new\" versus \"old\" university debate\nthis week with the publication of\neight fund-holding council asses-ment overview reports.\nSome former polytechnics scored\nvery highly, while other more established institutions attained less than\nglowing results. These reports, published by the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England, cover\neight subject areas and are a collation\nof the results and recommendations\noutlined during the asses ment of\nindividual establishments during the\n95/96 academic year. Each university and college was awarded a specific number of points in each of the\nareas: curriculum design, teaching,\nlearning and asses ment, student progression and achievement, learning\nresources, student support and gui d ance, and quality assurance.\nThe standard of higher education\nin English universities has been\nshown to be high, with most universities achieving good scores in most\nor all of the above areas. The quality\nof courses has since been approved\nby the funding council in all but six\ncases.\nAmong the consistent top performers are the University of\nNorthumbria, Queen Mary and\nWestfield College, Sheffield, Hull,\nWarwick, and University College,\nLondon.\nAlso issued last week were the\nresults of a survey by an American\nbased organization regarding the\nresearch strengths of British universities. The Institute of Scientific\nInformation, which monitors science\npublications, published their report\non university research which took\nfour years to compile. The ISI\nassessed research in twenty-one\nareas and ranked institutions according to the total number of citations\nreceived and the number of citations\nattained per paper for each field, the\nlatter allowing smaller universities to\nbe compared more equitably with\nlarger, more reputable ones.\nCareful examination of the conclusions drawn shows that Oxbridge\nresearch strength is very high, with\nOxford earning a place in the top\nthree for 17 out of the 21 fields\nincluded. Cambridge, s lig h ltl y lower\ndown the scale from Oxford, came\ntop in seven fields.\nOther establishments also fare\nvery well. Imperial College top the\nleague for citations per paper in both\nClinical Medicine and\nPharmacology, as well as falling\nwithin the first three for\nMathematics, Ecology/Environment,\nand Immunology. Imperial also\ndominates the \"Total citations\" table,\nbeing one of the top three universities for seven out of the twenty-one\nresearch fields assessed.\nWelsh student\naims high\nA Welsh student studying at IC has\ndeclared her ambition to become the\nfirst person from Wales to go into\nspace. Rhian Felstead is studying\nEngineering and French.\nShe has set her sights on travelling\nto Toulouse, the headquarters of the\nFrench Space Agency, for her year\nin Europe. Although Rhian has\nalways been interested in the final\nfrontier, her desire to journey into\nspace was recently ignited when she\nmet Helen Sharman, the only Briton\nto have gone into orbit. \"The way\nshe talked about what it was like,\nhow she felt....I was fascinated.\" The\nfirst step toward space, learning to\nfly, will have to wait until she completes her degree, as Rhian was not\nquite tall enough to enter the College\nAir Squadron. However, she refuses\nto let such a setback block her\nprogress \"Being in space and experiencing it for myself. That's the ultimate thrill.\"\n\n"

The piece of form-work (timber\n'A' frames used to set concrete) was\nin turn dislodged when a crane lifting\nanother frame knocked it.\nAn air ambulance and conventional emergency services were called to\nthe scene to attend to the injured\nman. After treatment on site for his\njaw, which was described as\n\"smashed\", he was taken to hospital.\nThis is the fourth incident this year\ninvolving one of the cranes on the\nBMS site. Over the summer the larger crane, 61 metres tall and stabilised\nby concrete weighing 100 tonnes,\nturned the wrong way and crashed\ninto the Chemistry building. A second incident involved a large block\nof concrete falling from a substantial\nheight. This accident led to a high-level health and safety investigation,\nwhich may eventually result in\nchanges in design of these types of\ncrane. On another occasion, due to a breakdown in communications, a crane put several tonnes of steel reinforcing rods through a window in the\nChemistry building. Four people\nwere in the room at the time.\nMiraculously, no-one was injured.\nFollowing these incidents, Schal,\nthe main contractor, has established a permanent Quality Manager on site.\nA Safety Manager was also appoint-ed. In response to the question of\nwhether further incidents were still\npossible, Ian Caldwell, Director of\nEstates, confidently stated \"We\nbelieve that what is in place should\nprevent other problems.\"\nAs a direct result of this accident\nchanges have been made to safety\nprocedures on site. Form-work that is\nstacked up in storage will be securely\ntied to the A frame, so it cannot fall.\nProgress on the construction, some of\nwhich is ahead of schedule, should\nnot be hindered by the new rule.\nThe injured man state was\ndescribed as \"stable and recovering\"\nby College officials, but \"would be\ndrinking soup for a while.\"\nJ ii\nEmergency services in action at the scene of Friday's a cci dent. A worker was seriously injured when the main gate\nstruck his jaw.\nPostgraduate loans scheme introduced\nMATHIEU RICHARD\nA new postgraduate loan plan is\npresently being discussed in the form\nof a collaborative project between\nMidland Bank and a group of 1\n1\nBritish universities, potentially\ninvolving the 30,000 postgraduate\nstudents of York, Durham, Bath,\nEssex, Sussex, Exeter, Reading, East\nAnglia, Surrey and Birbeck College\nin London.\nThe official aim of this new type of\nagreement is to \"encourage postgraduate study\" by offering the students\npreferential terms for bank loans.\nMidland Bank will offer loans of up\nto \u00a310,000 for fees and maintenance\ncosts (or \u00a35,000 for one-year cours-es) at a rate only 2 percent over their\nbase rate, and repayable for up to\nseven years after the end of the\ncourse.\nThis plan will add, to and supplant\nin many cases, the quasi-nonexistent\nResearch Council studentships and\nthe rare Government's Career\nDevelopment Loans by complementing public funding for postgraduates.\nThe latter was severely criticised by\nEssex Vice-Chancellor Ivor Crewe\nas \"inadequate to meet the [present]\nresearch needs of this country... and\nthe future staffing needs of our uni-vers i ties.\" Therefore, Mr Crewe welcomed the agreement as \"a very positive move\" towards more generalised postgraduate study.\nNevertheless, this optimistic view\nwas not shared by everyone. The students themselves, through the voice\nof their representing body, the\nNational Postgraduate Committee,\nexpressed their doubts as to the real\npurpose of this plan and its concrete\nconsequences.\nEffectively, Midland Bank's profitable \"marketing exercise\", as corn-continued on page four\n\n"

    "content": "14 COLUMNS FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER A week last Friday, at lunchtime,\nsomeone suggested that it was time\nmy photo was changed. I agreed,\nthinking that the Schal hat was more\nrelevant to last year's Felix, when\nscarcely a week went by without\nsome disaster engulfing Campus\nRenaissance. This year by comp ari son, things have been going pretty\nwell, with the BMS a mere three\nweeks behind schedule and rising\nlike the clappers. And then Friday\nafternoon's incident occurred, the\ndetails of which you will have seen\nelsewhere. Thankfully not as serious\nas it might have been, the contractor\nconcerned nevertheless received\nnasty injuries from which we all\nhope he will make a speedy recovery.\nWhat is particularly worrying is the\nfact that this occurred barely a month\nafter an independent safety review\nand the appointment of a Quality\nManager. The banal response that\naccidents do happen on construction\nsites is no excuse, particularly when\nprocedures are supposed to have\nbeen reviewed and tightened up.\nIt gets worse. The following Monday\nevening, a couple of chemists. They\nwere leaving the department by the\ndoor next to the site over which there\nis scaffolding, ushered through by\none of the workmen, who was direct-Simon Baker\ning the crane driver. Half way under\nit, the workman shouted \"Get Back\",\nshortly after which there was a loud\nbang on top of the scaffold walkway\nsuch that it visibly moved. Once they\nwere given the all clear and had\nwalked under it the workmen laughingly remarked\nthat \"I 've saved\nyour life. You\ncould have been\nkilled.\" This is\nabsolutely scan-da lou s. If possible\nthe worker responsible should be\nfound and\nremoved from the\nsite permanently.\nSuch a cavalier\nattitude will result\nin people both student and contractors alike being\nseriously injured.\nIt gives me no\npleasure to say\nthat the way things\nare going some \\1r\\[ r*f) fRp fl Cnn one will be killed VU1 C CUL RC U aU U before this project is over, at which\npoint the excrement will hit the rotating machinery with some force. I acknowledge that putting up large\nbuildings like the BMS and altering\nthe Library is an inherently risky\nbusiness, and safety is all about managing that risk. If however, the project had to conform to some of the\ncrackpot health and safety regulations that I as a chemist follow, I doubt very much if they would get\nbeyond the foundations. Sloppy\nsafety, like most\nworking practices,\ncan inevitably\ntraced to equally\nbad management.\nAt this point, dear\nreader, you would\nexpect to lay into\nmy esteemed\nfriend Ian\nCaldwell.

It\nincluded Delius's first masterpiece (a nostalgic farewell to the latter part of\nhis youth in Paris), an early one by\nRichard Strauss and one by Bruch\nwritten at the peak of his creativity,\njust before he became conductor of\nthe Liverpool Philharmonic Society.\nAll three are very generously\norchestrated, lyrical and rhythmically\nvivacious; just right to display the\nmusical strengths of ICSO, which are\nnow better than ever.\nThere are several other links\nbetween the three composers.\nBruch's most popular violin concerto\nlent ideas to Strauss on more than\none occasion in later life, including\nthe Alpine Symphony. Half of the\nscores Delius possessed were of\nmusic by Strauss, which helps to\nexplain how Delius learnt to balance\ngreat orchestral forces so well (but\nIC Choir\nLast Friday night (13th December)\nsaw this term Is concert of the\nImperial College Choir in the Great\nHall, Sherfield. Having heard from a number of sources a lot of impressive things about the standard of\nsinging, and on seeing an almost full\nhouse, I went to my first l.C. Choir\nconcert with high expectations. As\nis common in I.C. there are often\ndifficulties of varying levels caused\nby the male/female ratio; surprisingly it is the deficiency of male voices\n(there are almost as many male\nsingers as there are altos or sopra-nos) that is the problem. However,\nthis was made up for by some clear\nand confident singing especially\nfrom the tenors. It seemed that each\nmember of the choir knew when to\ncome in without waiting for someone else to follow (a common occurrence in some well-known choirs).\nI was not too convinced by the\ntempo, generally finding them a little on the slow side but this was the\nonly thing which made me feel a little uncomfortable. The four soloists\nand orchestra were remarkable, particularly the two sopranos (Naomi\nHarvey again and Janet Shell) who\nmanaged to deliver some of the\nmost horrendously difficult vocal\nlines ever written with such ease.\nwith poetry in place of rhetoric). The\nall-pervasive influence of Nietzsche\nat that time showed in the work of\nDelius and Strauss and encouraged\nthem in, among other things, their\nstrong egotism. Delius's consequent\nrejection of conventional morality\nled to the disease which blinded and\ncrippled him and which was probably contracted in a Parisian brothel.\nThe ICSO performance of \"Paris\"\ngripped throughout, from the atmospheric opening with the plaintive\nwoodwind solos on to the song- like\nviolin solo and the final, blazing,\n\"dawn\" section. This was reminiscent of JMW Turner's early masterpiece \"Norham Castle: Sunrise\" now\non show at the Tate Gallery. The bassoons took good advantage of the\nunusual opportunities offered to them\nin this piece. The orchestration is so\nmulti-faceted that I can only propose\na general vote of thanks to the rest of\nthe orchestra! The dynamics of this\npiece required and received very sen-Climbing in\nIC MOUNTAINEERING CLUB\nAfter a number of destination\nchanges (ranging from Devon to\nNorth Wales) we finally set off on\nFriday night in a completely random\ndirection.

    "content": "20 SPORT FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH DECEMBER FELIX SPO\nDeadlock in IC Derby as Seconds tie with Thirds\nThere was never any doubt that this\nwas a BIG match. Thanks to the relegation of the seconds last year, both\nthe second and third teams play in the\nsame division - hence this derby.\nNeither team's form thus far into the\nseason had been that good but this\nmatch wasn't about league status or\npoints - it was about pride and honour and all the things that are noble\non this earth. It was also about a large\nnumber of pints that had been staked\non the outcome but that was the furthest thing from our minds as the ref\nblew his whistle and the seconds\nkicked off.\nThe game started well for the\nthirds - strong challenges came from\nboth sides but the commitment from\nthe blues made it hard going for the\nseconds. The pace of the game was\nfast and the ball was played up and\ndown the field in frenzied attacks.\nBen and Simon were snorting fire\nand brimstone in midfield and it was\nabout fifteen minutes before the seconds started to fight back. With the\ntide of the game turning slightly, the\nthirds broke from defence with a strong run through the middle. The\ndefence backed away and so the shot\ncame from outside the penalty box\nand dipped over Steve's head into the\ngoal - the thirds had taken a shock\nlead. The rest of the half was dominated by a seemingly endless string\nof corners for the seconds. At last\none of Felix's in swingers was bundled into the goal by the mighty\nRobo and so half-time arrived with\nhonours even.\nSecond's captain Steve was not\nhappy at half-time - his standing in\nthe club, along with numerous\ndrinks, were on the line here. \"The\nSlags\" needed to show that they had\nthe class to beat the thirds with a little bit of intelligent play instead of\nthe headless chicken approach of the\nfirst half. The thirds resolved to keep\nbattling and start the second half as\nthey had the first.\nFrom the kick-off the seconds\nstarted to show that they could manage to pass the ball. The thirds didn't seem to be able to mount any form of\nattack as the ball was pinged about\nthe pitch from second's red shirt to\nsecond's red shirt. Defenders Will,\nGerman and Loz, 21, took control\nand gave the midfielders a bit of time\nto play with. Slick passing down the\nleft from Si, Phil \"the pill\" and Hajo\ncarved out many opportunities but\nstaunch defending, particularly from\nfull-backs Tim and Jamie who,\ndespite struggling with ridiculous\nhairstyles, ensured that the only shots\non goal were long-range efforts\nwhich the 'keeper dealt with easily.\nThe pressure continued with attack\nafter attack being repulsed by the\nthirds. Captain Dan showed what\ntrue commitment was by blocking\none cross with his testicles. Some of\nthe thirds commented, perhaps cruel-ly, that it was the first time that they\nhad seen him use his head this sea-son. As the clock ran down the sec-on ds' forays became tinged with desperation as they knew there was not\nmuch time left to save their re put a tion. Martin's bet that he would score\na hat-trick was lost, however, as the\nthirds' grit and determination at the\nback meant that they emerged moral\nvictors with a draw.\nThe league points were shared but\nthere was no doubt at who was more\npleased with the result. The seconds\nwill have to finish games off if they\nare to be promoted this season. The\nthirds' defensive fortitude will serve\nthem well if they can keep it up in\nsubsequent matches.\nSport in brief\nIC THIRDS TAKE ON RS M The Mines played IC III and through\na mixture of a slight inability of the\nRSM to finish the opportunities provided to them and some reasonable\ndefending from IC especially in the\nsecond half when they seemed content with playing 5 in midfield, we\nonly managed to score 2 goals. The\nfirst by Magnus in the first half the\nsecond in the second half by Craig\n(stealing the glory from Roger,\nunlucky mate).We would like to\nthank the opposition of IC V for providing the meal tickets for 2 of our\nteam.\nBOAT CLUB The boat club took a small squad to\nlast weekend's Walton Small Boat's head, but still managed to win most\ndivisions.\nThe double scull of Tom Gale and\nMartin Kettle were the fastest crew\nof the day, beating former World\nChampion Peter Haining in the\nprocess.\nRacing in a single scull, Pete\nWilson comfortably won the Senior\n2 and Senior 3 divisions, whilst\nSimon Dennis took the Novice\ncrown.\nRichard Dunn and Simon Wall\nhad a storming row in their class, finishing within a second of Atlanta\nOlympians Graham Smith and\nRupert Obholzer. Stefan Eyre and\nPaul Backes were third overall.\nSeveral other divisions were won\nagainst notable opposition, including\nthe University of London, who must\nby now be getting highly embarrassed by their inability to beat one\nof their constituent colleges.\nRUGBY SECONDS Despite a determined and aggressive\nperformance, IC Seconds went down\nfighting, 24-12, in a closely fought\ncontest with Charring Cross Seconds\n(again!) Early scores for Charring\nCross only succeeded in stirring the\nIC fire, with tries coming from\nDarren Bryce and David Pearce, and\na conversion from Justin Lee. The\nstars of this glittering performance\nare too numerous to all be mentioned\n- you all know who you are.\nHowever, special credit goes to Dave\nPearce and Peachy who both starred\nin unfamiliar positions.\nWe are now looking forward to\nour grudge clash with the Firsts next\nweek, when we hope we can repeat\nthis outstanding performance.\nSnooker Open \"Best in living memory\"\nLast Sunday saw the traditional\nImperial College Christmas snooker\nopen. There was a shock in the first\nround with the reigning champion\nJon Fulcher being beaten 2-0 in two\nhard fought, close frames by Club\npresident Russell Towers. Russell\nthen proved that this was no fluke by\nprogressing to the final with21 wins\nover first Alex Robinson and then\nSteff Lewis, winning in dramatic\nstyle after Steff went in-off the final\nblack. In the top half of the draw\nSimon Baugh made it to the final,\nbeating Aki Pakarinen (2-0) and Tim\nDann (2-1).\nThe final was a close affair. The\nfirst four frames were shared with\nRussell twice coming from behind to\nlevel at 2-2. In the deciding frame\nRussell pulled away to a35 point\nlead before Simon pulled himself\nback into it with some consistent\nscoring and then took the lead with a difficult 26 break. Simon eventually\nsecured the frame and match with the\nfinal blue and pink. The final was\ndescribed by one of the spectators as\n'the best in living memory'.\nThe Snooker Club now looks forward to a key match at Cardiff next\nweekend.\nInauspicious start for IC wrestling\nThe newly-formed Imperial Olympic\nWrestling Club got of to an inauspicious, if predictable, start at the 1996\nLondon Freestyle Championships on\n14th December. The championships,\nheld at Kensington Sports Centre,\nwas the last major tournament of the\nseason, and many of the country's top wrestlers attended. The sole IC\nentrant suffered two heavy defeats\nagainst experienced opponents,\nincluding an ex-Hungarian national\nsquad member, in the Senior 82kg division. Kensington Wrestling Club\n(which the Imperial club is part of)\nfared rather better, taking 3rd in the\n90kg,2 nd in the 82kg and firsts in\nboth the 57 and 62kg Senior events,\nand numerous trophies in the Junior\ncategories.\nFrank Murrey, sports and leisure\nmanager at IC, presented the trophies\non the day, emphasising the hope that\nwrestling will play an important role\nin the life of the planned sports centre to be built under Princes Gardens.\n\n"

A permanent\nQuality Manager was installed on\nsite by the main Contractors, Schal,\nand the College Safety\nRepresentative, Ian Gillet, was to\ntour the site weekly. The Quality\nManager would review the project\nover a month and report on his rec-om mend at ions, as well as keep an\neye on the day to day running of the\nconstruction. However, concerns\nwere not all smoothed, with one student commenting \"I still check the\nroof just outside the library just\nbefore I go in.\"\nRag inflicted the local populace\nwith their brand of humour in their\nannual Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump Rag event. Eight\nlucky and plucky souls gathered in a minibus outside Harrods to see who\nwould be the last one back to the\nUnion in a nude running contest. It's all for charity mind, and the event\nalways raises a lot of interest.\nThis year was no exception as a somewhat less fit competitor was\npicked up by the Police. Luckily for\nhim, they were in a nice mood and\nescorted him back to the Union\nbuilding to find some clothes. After\nreassuring their superior that it was\njust a student stunt, one commented\n\"women and children don't want to\nsee naked overweight blok es on the\nstreets.\" Rag Chair Andy Southern\ncounted this year's event to be a success. A secret pet was discovered in\nSelkirk Hall after one re-app found\nhimself sharing his morning shower\nwith a swarm of crickets. Not that\nsomewhere there was a resident that\nkept crickets. No. Selkirk Hall was\nhost to a tarantula spider, and the\ncrickets were just its food!\nThe culprit was soon apprehended,\nand the Hall fumigated. The resident\nwas given 48 hours to get rid of the\nspider. The homeless arachnid was\nlast seen advertised on a notice board\nin the Chemistry Department.\nISSUE1071 The Budget finally arrived and was a bit of a non-event really. Higher\nEducation got an extra \u00a3200 million,\nscience an extra \u00a320 million. The\nAUT claimed that their campaigning\nhad reduced the expected cut from\n3% to a mere 0.5% in real terms.\nRodney Eastwood, College's Director of Planning, said that the\nextra funding did not reverse last\nyear's deep cuts, but it was still too\nearly to say what affect the Budget\nwould have on Imperial College.\nFollowing the strike action two\nweek's earlier, HE staff were preparing to boycott teaching quality\nassessments as the next stage of their\nprotest. David Treisman, of the AUT,\ndescribed the Budget as \"a change in\nthe step of decline\" of HE funding\nbut stated that essentially, they were\npinning their hopes on Sir Ron\nDealing's report.\nAnother success story on the sporting front also with strong Imperial\nCollege involvement was the victory at the United Kingdom\nChampionships of the ULU Karate\nTeam. The team comprised two current IC student, a former IC student\nand a medic from University College\nHospital. They beat teams from\nManchester, Aberystwyth and\nLiverpool on their way to the title.\nA week after Lord Sherfield, a former Rector of the College died,\nNobel Laureate and Imperial College\nProfessor Abdus Salam passed away\nat the aged of 70. A leading light in\ntheoretical physics, Professor Salam,\nalso played a major role in many\ninternational organisations, including\nthe Third World Academy of Science\nand as scientific advisor to the United\nNations Educational and Cultural\nOrganisation.\nAutumn saw a mid-term trough for\nthe Royal College of Science Union\nas two of its officers resigned. Both\nthe Senior and Junior Honorary\nTreasurers submitted their resignations in a bad week for the RCSU.\nSenior Treasurer Ann Mitchell, was\nforced to resign due to a technicality\nin the Union's rules - the HST has to\nbe a permanent member of staff, and\nDr Mitchell had recently been moved\non to a short term contract. The HJT,\nChris Bragg, on the other hand was\nsimply annoyed with the financial\nincompetence of club treasurers, and\nafter two years in the job already\nunder his belt, decided to resign.\nRCSU President, Mo Dulloo, agreed\nthat there were some people who\nwere \"clueless\" about financial poli-cy.\nISSUE1072 More doom and gloom in the air for\nstudents with the news that the fatal\nbrain disease meningitis had\nclaimed two students at Cardiff\nUniversity. Five others were still\n'under observation' but were generally though to be OK. It was revealed\nthat the hall that the students lived\nhad had a case of bacterial meningitis\nfive weeks earlier. The President of\nCardiff Student's Union, Dot Hodge,\nsaid the two deaths had been trau-mati c. \"Most students of this age are\nnot used to dealing with this sort of\ngrief. Our priority is to do everything\nthat we can to help them cope.\nMedics in the news again as the\nsecurity at Wilson House became a hot issue. Four residents of the house\nwere disciplined under a new rule\nthat fines anyone who opened the\nfront door to people with out access\ncards. The fines of \u00a310 each were\nimposed by the porter after he caught\nthe students holding the door open\nfor their friends. Bryan Clarke\ndefended the fines by saying \"A rule\nis a rule. It has to be all or nothing for\nit to work.\" Sami Ansari, President of\nSt Mary's Student's Union described\nthe move as the \"gun-ho approach to\npolicy typical of IC bureaucrats.\"\nFinally, the long running saga of\nSir Nicholas Scott came to a head.\nAt a meeting of the full constituency\nparty he was de selected by 509 votes\nto 439, despite a last minute appeal\nand the backing of a hundred fellow\nMPs.

The\nEuropean Parliament disagreed and\nextended their investigation in to the\nBritish Government's handling of the\nBSE crisis. Elsewhere in the EU,\nbeef curtains remained firmly shut.\nISSUE 1068\nIn a much abridged Commemoration Ceremony, a bold Sir\nRonald Oxburgh told g radu and s his\nfears that \"the quality of education\nwas being threatened\" by the cuts in\nhigher education funding, he went on\nto highlight the College's achievements and the boat Clubs victory at\nHenley in particular, suggesting that\nanyone who could help financially in\nbuilding the new boat house should\nnot \"hesitate to let me know.\"\nMedical students reared their\nheads again with new uproar at room\nallocation in Wilson House, a previously medics only hall. The residents\nclaimed that non medical students\nhad been given places in preference\nto medical student in spite of an\nassurance that the homeless medics\nin question would be given places.\nThe Warden of the hall, Bryan\nClarke, told Felix that \"some of the\nrooms had become available for a short period because some of the residents had travelled abroad on place-ment.\" He pointed out that no medical students had applied for the\nplaces when they were advertised.\nStudent representatives disagreed,\nsaying that the spare rooms should\nhave been foreseen, and the displaced students had now found alternate accommodation and thus didn't apply for the rooms. They suggested\nthat this was \"a well orchestrated\nmove by the College to start introducing non-medics into Wilson\nHouse,\" and went against the grain of\nan earlier promise to keep the hall\nsolely for pre-clinical students after\n1998.\nExtremism of a different kind cast\na shadow over London as reports of\nactive fundamentalist Islamic\ngroups rose after a summer lull.\nKing's College seemed to attract\nmore than its fair share of attention as\nleaflet e ers taunted College and\nUnion authorities by placing themselves just beyond the jurisdictional\nboundaries. A statement from King's College Union read \"We find it\nimportant to protect our students\nform fundamentalism, especially the\nreligious type. King's has had problems with such groups of all faiths in\nthe past.\"\nOn a lighter note, the sandwich\nmakers of the College catering\ndepartment came into focus, or more\nprecisely, their valuing of their own\nwork. Following complaints about\nthe price of sandwiches, Felix decided to investigate... And found that,\nwhile the cost of the materials for\nproducing a simple sandwich\namounted to about 20p, the prices\nvaried between those of the College\ncanteens, those of local shops and\nHarrods. The College blamed overheads for their higher priced product.\nThe students, and staff, were uni m pressed.\nISSUE 1069\nThe question in everybody's mind\nwas whether or not the vote by higher education workers of all levels to\nstrike would actually mean IC getting pickets on the gates and a total\nshut down. Despite claims that the\nvote was \"the first time in history...\nthat everyone from 'porter to prof es sor' are going to close university\ngate\" the vote was far from\nun amino us. Three of the trades\nunions in the higher education consortium voting on industrial action\nonly made the majority required for\naction by 2%. However, Bryan\nWilson, President of the Imperial\nCollege branch of the AUT, pointed\nout that the turnout of 59% was higher than the average turnout at General\nElections of 50%. This, he said, was\na \"reflection of the anger\" felt by\nstaff at \"paltry pay rises.\"\nPro-Rector Alan Swanson commented that he would be \"surprised if\nthe Government turned in their\ntracks\" as result of the strike, but\nspeculated that the strike would be\nfairly solid among technical staff.\nAlthough this would mean the shut\ndown of many labs, he left it to\nHeads of Department to advise to\nstudents whether to turn up or not.\nOne definite downer was the\ndefeat by St Catherine's College,\nCambridge of Imperial's University\nChallenge team. After last year's glorious victory, much was expected\nof the four team members. However,\nwith presenter le remy Paxman urging them on (the fact that St Cats is\nPaxman's alma mater didn't escape\nThe Mirror's TV critic), the gallant\nfoursome fell on the last question.\nAll was not lost, though, they still\nwent through to the next round as the\nhighest scoring losers.\nIn a sudden announcement, Sir\nNicholas Scott, MP for Kensington\n& Chelsea, was told that he would\nbe replaced by his constituency party\nas the candidate in the next election.\nThe executive of the Kensington &\nChelsea Conservative Party decided\nto drop Sir Nicholas as their candidate after he was found drunk face\ndown in a gutter at the Tory party\nconference. In response, Sir Nicholas\nthreatened to resign, thus putting the\nGovernment's fragile majority in\njeopardy. He called for a full meeting\nof the constituency party to which he\nwould put his case. The electorate\ncarried on as normal.\nISSUE 1070\nIn the event, the miserable and\nappalling weather discouraged most\npeople from coming into College on\nthe day, but striking staff were\nmanning the picket from an early\nhour. Imperial College was not the\nworst hit HE institution by a long\nway, but even here the strike had\nsome effect. Five departments were\nclosed entirely, and several others\nhad a 'reduced service'.\nThe strikers were in a bullish\nmood. \"The whole of HE is screwed\nsaid one picket er of the proposed\nGovernment cuts. Students came in\nfor some minor criticism from some\nNews Review "
