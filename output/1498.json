    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX\n22 Friday 21 october 2011\nComment Editors: Sam Horti\nTim Arbabzadah\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nE\nquality is based on the\nmathematical equation. x =\nx, y = y, there\u2019s no 2 ways\nabout it. It has to be the\nsame quantity, size, value\netc. When applied to people, it refers\nto the state of being equal, especially in\nstatus, rights and opportunities. What it\ndoes not take into consideration is the\ndifference between people, their role in\nthe world, their characteristics \u2013 their\nindividuality. It turns human beings into\nnumbers and equations, in order to suit\nthe logistics, to make it easy for law-makers. On the other hand, fairness involves taking into consideration a person\u2019s needs, his/her background \u2013 his/\nher individuality. It treats human beings\nas more than just numbers and equa-tions, it treats them as individuals with\nemotions, beliefs and morals.\nTake the famous battle of the sexes.\nMen and women are not the same, they\nare different: they have different emotional and physical needs, different\nMahfooz Hasan\nDid you know I once saw John Cleese\nin a curry house?\nWhen Equality is Unfair\nways of thinking, different way of doing\nthings etc. Providing them with equal\nresources and treating them as equals\nis at times unfair. For example, giving\nboth men and women one month parental leave is unfair. A woman needs to go\nthrough a great deal more during preg-nancy, child-birth, and after the child\nis born. Egalitarianism would suggest\nan equal time off for both parents, but\nanyone with any sort of logical thinking would agree that women should be\ngiven a longer maternal leave than men\nget for paternal leave. Equality can at\ntimes be unfair, and to exercise a fair\nsystem one must look at the individuality of a person, rather than just looking\nat people as numbers and equations.\nLet\u2019s look at a more controversial\nexample: wages. Almost everywhere\nyou will see that employees of the same\ngrade are paid equal salary. For exam-ple, all sales assistants in a supermarket\nwill be paid x amount of money, so as\nto comply with equality laws, and at\nT\nhis one sentence can kickoff a near-endless conversation of who saw who,\nwhere and doing what.\nLike them or loathe them,\ncelebrities do get people talking. Off\nthe top of my head, I can\u2019t think of\nany other use they might have. Every\nday it gets easier to gossip \u2013 not just\nbecause of The News of the World\u2019s\nstandard journalistic practices \u2013 but\nalso because of the sheer abundance\nof celebrities in our society today.\nThe only celebrities I had when I\nwas growing were Eric Cantona, Konnie Huq and Leonardo from the Superhero Mutant Ninja Turtles. Now\nthere are more celebrities than there\nare particles in the universe. Part of\nthe reason for this is that the entry requirements for becoming a celebrity\nhave been severely lowered. Instead\nof being a great athlete; successful\nmusician or actor; or a superhero role-model, celebrity status is endowed on\nanyone who has been on half an episode of X-Factor or Big Brother. Honorary celebrity status is even granted\nto the siblings of celebrities, regardless of their talent, or lack thereof.\nWhile I do worry that this is raising a culture of entitlement and that\nfame is an ends unto itself, I can go\nabout my daily life more or less nor-mally. Celebrities are other people.\nWhat really concerns me is where this\ntrend is heading. Another reason why\nwe have so many celebrities today is\nthat yesterday\u2019s celebrities (providing\nthey haven\u2019t slipped into the limbo\nof obscurity) are still around, mixing with the celebrities of today. The\ncelebrities of tomorrow will have to\nmingle with both of these earlier spe-cies, while more continue to be made.\nThe Earth can only support so many\npeople: it will positively groan under\nso many egos.\nIf the cult of celebrity continues to\ngrow at this rate, I predict that there\nwill come a point where everything\nflips. It\u2019ll happen when there are more\ncelebrities than \u201cnormal\u201d people. By\nvirtue of their rarity, the normal people will be the new celebrities. For a\nwhile, more traditional celebrities will\ncontinue to be pumped out, elevating\nthe status of the \u201cnormals\u201d who are\nleft. Suddenly, celebrity magazines\nwill begin pandering to them, so that\nthe celebrities can find out how dress,\neat and exercise like a \u2018normal\u2019 per-son.\nThat\u2019s only the tip of the pendulum\nthough. Once TV producers cotton on\nto the reversed social order, they\u2019ll\nstart making shows where celebrities\nare turned into ordinary people. The\nprizes would br grandiose: one million\npounds! \u2013 removed from your estate.\nThen the biographies and tabloid confessionals would come out, the truth\nin first edition. Celebrities will admit\nto all the drugs they haven\u2019t taken, all\nthe people they haven\u2019t slept with, all\nthe outrageous behaviour that they\nmight have exaggerated a teeny bit.\nThe greatest revelation will be that\nfirst glace this appears to be fair and\njust. But if we consider the individuality of the persons working in that post,\nwe see that the output varies from person to person. Not everyone is equally\nmotivated, equally skilled or equally\nhonest \u2013 not everyone has the same\ncharacteristics. An employee who puts\nforth double the effort, and sells double\nthe quantity of stock is paid the same as\nan employee who puts in a luck-lustre\neffort and couldn\u2019t care less about how\nmany products the shop is selling. In\nhindsight, surely, that looks like a poor\ndeal for the employee who actually\nwants to work.\nConventional wisdom suggests that\nunequal salary would cause friction and\njealousy in workplace, but in truth an\nequal salary system is worse. It infuriates the hard-working employees, who\nfeel aggrieved that colleagues that are\nputting in less effort are paid the same\nsalary. It can bother them so much that\nthey eventually slack off themselves.\nResearch shows that this breeds\nmore envy, and produces lower morale\namongst employees than there would\nbe in an unequal wage environment.\nFurthermore, an equal salary means\nthere is no longer a monetary incentive\nto exceed in your job. Employees also\nperceive the equal wage system as less\nfair, and this perception will lead to decreased efficiency in the workplace.\nOf course, there are times when\nequality is fair. For example, men and\nwomen should be given equal opportunities to pursue a good education and a\ncareer of their choice. But perhaps we\nshould not be so fixated on the ideology that equality solves discriminatory\nproblems. Perhaps discrimination at\ncertain times provides the solution for\nsome of the problems; discrimination\nbased on people\u2019s work ethic, their effort and their honesty. Equality at times\nis unfair, and we should seek to be a\nsociety that aspires to be fair, not to be\nequal.\nCharlie Sheen is actually a practicing\nMethodist.\nI can\u2019t imagine what will happen after this great reversal, nor can I think\nof a way that it can be avoided. Celebrity begets more celebrity. They feed\non the fuel of interest, and can only\ndie when that fuel is exhausted. But\nwe\u2019ll never stop talking about celebri-ties. How do I know? I don\u2019t even care\nfor them and I\u2019ve spent the whole of\nthis article talking about them!\nRhys Davies\nI\u2019m going to show her my Ohhh face\nI would like to make it clear\nthat this article is not a vent\nfor my disappointment at\nbeing the one person in the\nUK not to have their phone\nhacked by The News of the\nWorld. Although, I am quite\ninsulted at not being hacked.\nDon\u2019t you know who I am?\n\n"

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nFELIX\n10\nTips and hacks\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 21 october 2011\nMmm... Ice Cream Sandwich\nEarlier this week, Android and Samsung held a\njoint event to announce some news we\u2019ve been\nwaiting on for a while. Why the joint event? Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Nexus will be the first phone to\nship with Android 4.0 \u2013 Ice Cream Sandwich. The\nGalaxy Nexus is a behemoth of a device, with a\n4.65\u201d HD display. But other than that, it\u2019s pretty\nmuch what you\u2019d expect from a top end smart-phone. The main selling point, as seems to be\nincreasingly the case with flagship phones, is\nthe new operating system at its heart. Ice Cream\nSandwich brings with it a slew of new features,\nincluding a lot of UI overhaul. Much of it we\u2019ve\nseen elsewhere, but some things do stand out.\nAndroid Beam for example, which uses NFC to allow you to tap your phone with another to share\nanything from contacts to directions. Together,\nI\u2019m sure this combination will do nothing to hurt\nAndroid\u2019s popularity.\nBitcoin, the decentralized \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 favoured by anarchists and drug dealers for its pri-vacy, has suffered a minor crash in value that has\ntaken it from a value of $30 per coin to parity with\nthe USD. Some commentators expect the value\nto slide further, reflecting a return to reality after\na heady year of press attention. Each coin represents an extremely large number and is calculated\nin a computationally intensive process that limits\nthe chance of the market being flooded; with the\npower required to produce more coins increasing\nregularly and their value at current levels, it is becoming uneconomic to make more. All of this isn\u2019t\na death knell for the currency, yet the massive\nrate fluctuation is probably going to cause new\ninvestors to steer clear of the coins. Indeed, it is\nhard to see major investors going after Bitcoins\nas a serious investment - with no clear \u2018issuing\nbank\u2019 or fiscal policy and less purchasing power\nthan the US dollar, traditional investors are likely\nto see Bitcoins as a no-go zone for now. Where\nthe Bitcoin goes from here isn\u2019t very clear, with\nsome seeing this crash as a mere phase in the\nlonger process of establishing the legitimacy of\nthe currency. One thing remains certain, unless\nthe Bitcoin world builds more of a connection to\nthe physical world of goods and services, it\u2019s unlikely to become more than a niche currency for\nthe mildly paranoid or the tad criminal.\nBitcoin suffers devaluation\nAs I\u2019m sure many of you know, Research In\nMotion last week suffered its biggest ever\nservice disruption, with millions of customers\nacross the globe affected. Users lost access to\npush email, BlackBerry Messenger, Facebook\nand Twitter applications, and even in some\ncases their internet access. For a company that\nbuilt its reputation on many of those features,\nand indeed, the stability and reliability of\nthose services, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a week the executives would rather forget.\nWhile over here there were probably many\npeople rejoicing that the \u201criot-inducing\u201d messaging service was down, the consumers were\nleft wondering why. Even now, BlackBerry\nhave not exactly been forthcoming on the\ndetails, saying only that their failover, well,\nfailed. That is, for some reason their main\nserver network was down and their backup\ninfrastructure didn\u2019t manage to take over\nproperly. Along with that, all we do know is\nthat the problem occurred at their datacentre\nin Slough.\nThere is speculation abound on the internet,\nas always, as to why this happened in the first\nplace. Some say the cause was an update to\nthe original server (in which case a manual\nswitchover should have taken place), some\nsay it was a bug in one server. Whatever the\ncause, Research In Motion claim the failover\nswitch had been tested, but it seems not rigorously enough. Regardless, the issue here is\nclearly that of not enough redundancy.\nWhile this is speculation, it doesn\u2019t seem\nThe BlackBerry Crumble\nunreasonable to assume that this failover\nswitch and this network of servers in Slough\nare of utmost importance given the number of\nBlackBerry users that were affected in the first\ninstance. Hence, it would make sense to have\nnot just one set of backup servers, but two or\nmore. Indeed, it has been said in the past that\nmaintaining scalability of their infrastructure\nhas not been Research In Motion\u2019s top prior-ity. This would be fine if their customer base\nwas sticking around a fairly stable figure, but\nthat\u2019s not the case. While their share prices\nmay have been dropping recently, their market\nshare in UK mobile handsets has been on the\nrise, and last year they had a massive increase\nin year-on-year sales. The fact that they\u2019ve\njust released a new fleet of devices is unlikely\nto reverse that either.\nBut let\u2019s say that this was unavoidable, that\nno matter what, the datacentre was always\ngoing to fail. Then we still have the issue of\nwhy the problems spread across the world and\nlasted for a few days. At the time of the fail-ure, emails weren\u2019t being pushed to devices,\nBlackBerry Messenger wasn\u2019t working, etc.\nSo it seems, with nothing to lose, they may as\nwell have \u2018disconnected\u2019 the centre, whatever\nthat involved, wired up the backup server as\nthe active one, and started again.\nPerhaps the problem could be pinpointed\nto the backlog. Considering that these servers apparently serve Europe, the Middle East\nand Africa, even a few minutes of downtime\nwould cause a massive backlog, which may\nhave been too much for the secondary servers\nto cope with. Maybe that server then crashed,\nand all traffic was rerouted to another datacen-tre. Which then crashed. And so on. But again,\nthis seems unlikely, considering the time delays between each affected region. Whatever\nthe cause, it\u2019s clear the company needs to\nre-evaluate its infrastructure. If this were to\nhappen globally on the BlackBerry Enterprise\nServers, I think the company would struggle\nto recover.\nHowever, I don\u2019t want this to seem like\nan attack on BlackBerry. I love the devices,\nand actually wasn\u2019t that angry during the\noutage. But many were, and just because I\nwasn\u2019t enraged doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t believe it\nshould\u2019ve have happened. At least, on a positive note, they were slightly better at keeping\ncustomers informed than they were at working\non the problem. Also, they are offering reimbursements in the guise of free apps to every-one, which is better than nothing.\nChris Bowers\nDennis Ritchie - An Unsung Hero\nThe world has lost two giants of technology in\nas many weeks. The news that Dennis Ritchie\ndied on 12 October, aged 70, after enduring\ncancer and heart disease for several years, elicited a quieter response than that for Steve Jobs.\nRitchie was the creator of the C programming\nlanguage and one of the co-inventors of the\nUNIX operating system, which means we\u2019re\nliving in a world Ritchie helped to invent.\n\u201cWhen Steve Jobs died last week, there\nwas a huge outcry, and that was very moving\nand justified\u201d, said Rob Pike, a colleague of\nRitchie\u2019s, speaking to Wired. \u201cBut Dennis had\na bigger effect, and the public doesn\u2019t even\nknow who he is.\u201d\nPretty much all of the daily interactions\nwe have with technology owe something to\nRitchie\u2019s creations 40 years ago. The internet\nis built on UNIX, from the server farms behind Google and Amazon to the router through\nwhich you\u2019re locally connected. Your TV\nprobably runs an operating system based on\nUNIX. As does your Mac, your iPhone, your\niPad - OS X and iOS are built on a UNIX variant - and of course any Linux machine.\nThen there\u2019s C, the language in which UNIX\n\u2013 and a vast amount of other software from the\ncore of Windows to MATLAB \u2013 is written.\nAnd when software isn\u2019t written in C there\u2019s\na very good chance it\u2019s written in a language\ndescended from, or heavily influenced by,\nRitchie\u2019s creation, whether C++, Java, or C#.\nUNIX was developed by Ritchie and Ken\nThompson at AT&T\u2019s Bell Labs in the 60s after the project they had been working on \u2013 an\nambitious multi-user operating system known\nas Multics \u2013 was dropped by the company for\nbeing too complex. Young, idealistic, and stub-born, Ritchie and Thompson decided to build\na simpler, streamlined version of the operating\nsystem by themselves: Unics \u2013 or UNIX \u2013 a\npun on Multics, was soon born.\nC was designed by Ritchie initially as a\nmeans to an end in developing his new operating system, but its versatility and ability to be\ncompiled to different computer architectures\nquickly made it an enormously useful tool. The\nC Programming Language, the book Ritchie\nwrote with Brian Kernighan, setting out the\nstandard definition of the C language, has become a classic.\nDue to its official status as a telecoms mo-nopoly, AT&T was at first unable to enter the\ncomputer industry and thus unable to market\nthis new operating system it suddenly had its\nhands on. So Ritchie and Thompson simply\ngave their creations away to friends and colleagues in universities, who used them to teach\na generation of programmers, engineers, and\ncomputer scientists.\nEven more crucially, Ritchie\u2019s initial free\ndissemination of UNIX and C led to the free\nsoftware movement. When AT&T eventually\nwriggled itself into a position where it could\nmake money from UNIX, MIT researcher\nRichard Stallman started making a free version\nof UNIX under the GNU (Gnu\u2019s Not UNIX)\numbrella. GNU \u2013 along with its Linux kernel\nand myriad satellite utilities \u2013 is at the core of\neverything open source.\nIt\u2019s so easy to forget about the countless, un-sleeping machines behind the slickness of today\u2019s interactions with technology, but Ritchie\nlives on in the hearts of most of them. Now\u2019s\na good time to spare a thought both for them\nand him.\nDouglas Heaven\n\n"

The Christian Union\u2019s\nlatest poster, for instance, which advertised with glee a speaker who is said\nto \u201cput the fear of God up atheists\u201d,\nusing the same reassuring tones that\nCrusades-era religious believers were\nso good at employing. And yet \u2013 no\ncolumn on it. I just couldn\u2019t summon\nthe will to invent new defecation-based\nswears that adequately captured the\nbarrel-scraping depths to which those\nshit-gargling evangelists had stooped.\nMaybe, I thought, I was getting old. I\nwas mellowing.\nThen a friend of mine forwarded\na link to a Felix article. And after I\u2019d\nblacked out with incandescent rage\nand laid waste to a small segment of\nWest Kensington, I found myself with\na desire to write. The article in question\nfeatures in last week\u2019s Felix, discussing the merits of the Jeremy Kyle show\nwith all the thoughtfulness and understanding of a Tory social policy.\nAs a piece of writing, it makes about\nas much sense as the opinions it clumsily attempts to shit out onto the page.\nStarting off appearing to criticise the\nmuch-maligned talk show for the way\nit treats its guests and so on, by the end\nof the article the author is praising it\nfor being such. \u201cIt may well be \u2018human\nbear-baiting\u2019\u201d, he writes, barely visible\non top of his stack of high horses, \u201cbut\nto be honest it\u2019s funnier than a penguin\nAngry Geek\nYour meat offends me, deal with it\nLow Class versus No Class - Jeremy\nKyle and Felix TV\nplaying a banjo.\u201d Well, as long as it\u2019s\nfunny.\nIt\u2019s probably worth mentioning that\nthe Jeremy Kyle show is not the best\ntelevision show around. Remember,\nthough, that the production team heavily cherrypick their guests to maximise\nwhatever effect they\u2019re going for that\nweek. The one solitary piece of factual information in the Felix article\nexplained how some episodes focus on\nsob stories, others attempting to \u2018resolve\u2019 conflict - generally through poking the guests until one of them snaps\non camera. Once you\u2019ve got the right\nguests, the rest is left up to Jeremy him-self, a man with slightly less charisma\nthan a dead monitor lizard, and equally\ncold-blooded.\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the fact that the\nshow appears to appeal to people \u2018below you\u2019, though. The entire show is\ndesigned to make you think it\u2019s targeting someone less classy than you.\nThat\u2019s the show\u2019s selling point: that\nwhen you watch it, you get to feel su-perior. Even the Felix article manages\nto deduce this with the limited number\nof brain cells seemingly available to\nthe author, noting in conclusion that\n\u201cit does wonders for your ego to know\nthat you will never be as shit a person\nas they are\u201d, although this fact is noted\nwithout the appropriate level of irony.\nIt\u2019s no surprise though. Most of this\narticle was written on autopilot, spewing out lines repeated so often they\u2019ve\nlost all meaning. It\u2019s like Racist Fuckwit Bingo. \u201cLeeching off the government.\u201d Tick. \u201cToo damn lazy to get a\nI\nwas eating my lunch in the JCR\n(two-bean goulash YUM! :D)\nand this random guy just comes\nand sits down next to me and\nstarts devouring a greasy\nstinky burger. I asked him if he minded moving because I find the stench of\ncooked meat to be nauseating. As you\nmay have guessed, I\u2019m a vegan. When\nI see people eating meat, cheese, cake\nor any other food that has come from\nanimals, I just feel sick. I\u2019m not one of\nthose in-your-face vegans, but I have\nmy right to ask someone to move if\nthey\u2019re going to offend my beliefs.\nThe guy rudely told me to f**k off, so\nI just moved to another table. I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to stoop to his level so I just\nwalked away. Always ignore a bully ;)\nAnyway, I\u2019m not here to preach, I\njust want to explain my views. If you\neat stuff that comes from animals, you\nare wrong. I\u2019m sorry, but you are. You\ncan defend your actions as much as\nyou like by saying that animals don\u2019t\nhave emotions or can\u2019t feel pain, but\nthey have rights and you are abusing\nthem. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not saying that\nyou can\u2019t eat meat because everyone\nhas freedom, but you have to know\ndeep-down that what you are doing is\nimmoral.\nNo-one has asked animals if they\ncan eat their meat or drink their milk.\nI don\u2019t go around eating people\u2019s babies because that would be frowned\non and I would go to prison, but it\u2019s\nno different to eating animals. The\nother day I was on my uncle\u2019s farm\nwhen some chicks were hatching and\nI just couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would want to murder those little\ncuties. When you look in their eyes\nthere is something there, like an unex-plainable connection. I think the baby\nchickens have just as much a soul\nas we do \u2013 along with loads of other\nanimals.\nSome people argue that eating the\neggs of chickens (or ducks, or other\nbirds) doesn\u2019t harm them in anyway,\njob.\u201d Tick. \u201cThey need educating\u201d.\nHouse! What do I win, George? Oh, it\u2019s\na fundamental misunderstanding of the\nfoundation of equality that modern society is built on. Hooray!\nI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of bullshit like\nthis, and having to excuse my own\nfucking institution when talking to other people. That friend that sent me the\narticle? He goes to Aberdeen University. The only reason he saw this article\nwas because it got linked to on a major\nInternet forum that decried it as horrific and insulting - which it is. While\nit thrills me to have something to be so\nriled by, and it pleases me that Felix\ncan still print student opinion no matter\nhow moronic, I think it\u2019s time for some\nof us to take a step back and actually reexamine the world we\u2019re living in.\nI don\u2019t expect people who are educated enough to study at Imperial,\nand interested enough to sign up for\na course based on science, reason and\nintellect, to be writing in their student\npaper espousing the merits of inequality and holier-than-thou fuckwittery. I\nknow I detest almost every single one\nof you fuckers, but I do that anyway.\nThat\u2019s a baseline. You don\u2019t have to\naspire towards that goal by being the\nbiggest horse cock you can possibly be.\nSo maybe next week we could have a\nTV section about actual television, and\nI\u2019ll try and have a comment column\nabout how funny it is when geologists\npretend they\u2019re actually doing science.\nThat way, no-one has to be sterilised.\nbut if you think about it, it\u2019s sort of\nstealing. No-one has asked the chicken if you can take her eggs and I read\nthis article once that said that they\nhave tested chicken\u2019s stress levels after stealing their eggs and it goes up!\nI don\u2019t think I could eat an omelette\nknowing that there is a stressed chicken on my hands.\nAnyway, that\u2019s my little piece over.\nLike I say, I have opinions and I\u2019m\nnot expecting you to read my articles\nif you don\u2019t like them, so there is no\nneed to post nasty comments about my\narticles on the Felix website. I don\u2019t\nmind constructive criticism, but I\nwon\u2019t read your abusive comments :)\nGurl With Opinions\nApparently he likes to lick things clean. This is an innuendo-free caption\n\n"

The game began well for the\n4s with the defence standing strong,\nbut then the RSM strikers became too\nmuch and they scored two well-taken\ngoals in quick succession. Shortly af-ter, however, veteran 4th team member,\nLuke Reynolds, managed to score one\nof his trademark reverse stick shots. IC\npressed, but unsuccessfully, and these\nattacks left gaps behind for the RSM to\nexploit. The RSM managed to hit a few\nmore goals, but the efforts from James\nPeck and Luke meant that the final score\nof 7-3 was a respectable one, consdier-ing the RSM team do have some very\ngood players.

However, it wasn\u2019t long before\nIC hit their stride. Some quick passes\nsaw Harry Stevenson open the scoring,\nbefore Teddy Middlebrook doubled the\nadvantage. With a two goal cushion IC\nhit cruise control. Anytime the UCL\nplayers collected the ball, player of the\nmatch Celia Hayes broke down the attack and linked up with the midfield\nbeautifully. The icing on the cake was\na brilliant breakaway goal that Harry\nscored with a sweet strike. 3-0 the final\nscore was well deserved.\nThe Ladies\u2019 2s were next up and keen\nto show what they could do. IC started\nwell, but the difference in benches (UCL\nhad 8 more subs) proved to be the biggest factor, and eventually, UCL broke\ndown a tired IC. The final score line of\n5-0 definitely flattered UCL. There were\nmany positives to take away from the\nloss, with many players in the team actually playing for the first time. All the\nfreshers performed very well, with Leslie impressing the most. Despite being a\nnovice, she played a great game, defending fearlessly and played some fantastic\nballs.\nThe last game of the day saw the\nMen\u2019s 3s take on UCL Men\u2019s 3s in what\nwould be the biggest IC victory of the\nday. UCL were on the back foot straight\nfrom the push back with IC pressing\nhard. IC found themselves 2-0 in 10\nminutes, with Kenneth Chau and Alex\nKirby both getting early goals. The defence also proved that anything the attack could do, they could do better, with\nJack Tremlett and Alex Jones shutting\ndown any UCL play. Another goal from\nKenneth and a double from James Goksaran put IC 5-0 up early on in the second half, which was also how the game\nended.

    "content": "The launch of the QE2\nFELIX Friday 21 OCTOBER 2011 15\nBUSINESS\nLegend has it that, as for all faithful\nMuslims, the day came when the good\nKing Musa of Mali announced to his\npeople that he would be leaving Mali\nfor the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca.\nThe announcement, though praised by\nthe wise and respected by all his sub-jects, came with fear, as the trip from\nNiani to Mecca was long and perilous.\nWishing to ease their king\u2019s trip,\nthe people of Mali helped with the arrangements of the royal caravan. When\nit finally departed, the royal party was\nsomething to be seen: more than a thousand courtiers attended King Musa,\naccompanied by their servants and belongings and carried on myriads of camels in a procession so long it was said to\ntake more than two days to see it pass\nby. Among their effects, King Musa\nhad taken with him the royal treasury\nof Mali, which, according to the legend,\nconsisted in such a wealth in gold that\nit required no less than a hundred elephants to be carried.\nAfter a peaceful journey through the\nSahara, the royal party reached Egypt,\nwhere caliph Al-Nasir received King\nMusa warily in Cairo; his spies had told\nhim that the king\u2019s wealth was so fabulous he could have bought the whole\nof Egypt. However, the Caliph needn\u2019t\nhave feared, as Cairo\u2019s most capable\nmerchants were on his side.\nAccording to the legend, whilst AlNasir and Musa entertained themselves\nin staring contests to determine who\nshould vow to whom first, Musa\u2019s royal\nIf central banks could instigate growth\nby simply printing more money, they\nwould have done so a long time ago.\nA recent Bank of England (BoE) research report attests to the theory that\ncash injections are inflationary: while\nthe Quantitative Easing (QE) package\nof \u00a3200bn had an initial macroeconomic impact of 1.5-2%, it was quickly\nfollowed by an increase in Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI, the key index for in-flation) of about 1.5%. Inflation may\nhelp reduce unemployment according\nto Keynesian doctrine, but it will not\nbenefit the underlying economy in the\nlong term.\nSo why would the BoE, with the\nbenefit of hindsight in these statistics\non the first QE program, still press forward with a second round of Quantitative Easing \u201cQE2\u201d, creating \u00a375bn of\nelectronic money with which to buy gilt\n(UK government bonds)?\nFor one thing, the negative effect of\nthe first QE package - inflation - appears\nto be far smaller than what would be ex-pected: although the BoE had injected\nthe capital equivalent of 14% of the\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) into the\neconomy, inflation accounted for by the\nQE so far has maxed at 1.5% - small in\ncomparison to the money injected.\nBesides, since reaching its peak in\nJanuary 2010, the growth of the broad\nmoney aggregate M4 (an estimate of the\nentire supply of money within an econ-omy) has been stagnant; it has even de-clined. Given the velocity of circulation\nof money went unchanged, this suggests\nthat the country may soon be facing de-flationary pressures instead of an inflationary ones. In the face of deflation QE\nmight not be so bad an idea after all.\nSecondly, whether originally intended\nor not, QE2 will buy more time for the\ncoalition government - for George Osborne\u2019s fiscal consolidation plan and\nausterity measures to begin to work.\nDespite the coalition government\u2019s\nfreezing of spending, cutting of civil\nservant jobs, and reducing of social\nwelfare payments, the UK economy, as\nmeasured by GDP, has grown slower\nthan expected. This will hurt the growth\nof tax revenue, and delay Osborne\u2019s\ntimetable for deficit reduction. QE2\ncan help here in two ways: by creating a positive impact on GDP growth\nin short time horizon, and by helping to\ninflate the economy, thus reducing the\ncost of any tax reductions implemented.\nAdditionally, by lowering the yield on\n10-year government bonds through\nQE2, the BoE will manage to reduce the\nborrowing cost for the coalition govern-ment, at a time when interest payment\nfor government debt already accounts\nfor 7% of the budget expenditure.\nWhatever the problems with QE it\nwould therefore seem that unless more\npublic sector jobs are to be shed, sig-Shiang-Jin Chin\nhousehold visited Cairo\u2019s bazaar to buy\nfor their master all the luxuries on offer.\nUpon realizing that the fabled wealth of\nKing Musa was no tale, the merchants\npromptly discovered that what no Egyptian would have paid more than 3 dinar\nfor, Musa\u2019s subjects would buy for 30.\nThey increased their prices by so much\nfor the Malians that upon leaving Cairo\ntowards Mecca the king\u2019s wealth had all\nbut vanished, left in hands of the happy\nfew bazaar merchants.\nThese merchants, suddenly rich and\nlacking of any good incentive to save\nor bury their new fortunes, simply increased their consumption proportion-ally. But their interests clashed: they all\nwanted to buy then same fine things and\nthe market became saturated with de-mand. They discovered that they could\nnot get all they wanted without bidding\nup the prices and soon Cairo\u2019s real es-tate, food and commodity market prices\nhad doubled, reaching levels hitherto\nunknown. Such are the risks of QE.\nIn 1752 the Scottish Philosopher David Hume came up with an explanation\nfor the mechanism by which the Egyptian economy could have equilibriated\nfollowing this cash injection: Hume\u2019s\nprice-specie-flow mechanism.\nCrucially, medieval Egypt was not an\nisolated community, but traded actively\nwith countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. After King Musa left, it found itself\nflooded with gold, and this lead to internal inflation. However, foreign goods\nwere still as cheap as before, and having more gold, Egypt could steeply increase its imports. Concurrently, Egyptian goods being so expensive, exports\nwould have ceased. This would then\nlead to a decrease in the gold income\ndue to exports, and, imports being paid\nin gold, to an effective export of Egypt\u2019s\ngold; the balance of payments would\nMansa \u2013Emperor\u2013 Musa of Mali (1312-1337, bottom right), holding one of the golden nuggets Mali was so famous for during the Middle Ages\nDavid Hume (1711-1776), Scottish Philosopher and Economist\nWhilst QE2 is being launched, Cameron happily counts how many more are\ngoing to be needed. This is cagely received by an ageing Osborne and King.\nnificant reductions to the funding for\nschools and hospitals are made, or support cut off for those reliant on public\npension schemes and social benefits, the\nburden caused by repayments must be\nshared. In launching the QE2 the BoE is\nsimply making this decision for us.\nThe Economy in History\nThe Cautionary Tale of Mansa Musa of Mali\nPanta rei; money too\nthus become (very) negative.\nThen, as more and more gold was\ntaken abroad, Egyptian inflation would\nhave to come to an end and bazaar merchants would begin to feel their pockets empty. Unable to bid up their prices\ninternally, price deflation would follow.\nHowever, Hume continued, since Egyptian prices were then set to deflate, at\nsome point their goods would again become attractive exports that foreigners\nwould pay for in gold. So, after a time,\nan equilibrium would be reached, and\nthe balance of payments be restored.\nIncidentally, a great deal of king Musa\u2019s gold ended up in Italian merchants\nhands, where it helped finance the early\nItalian Renaissance.\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\n\n"

Biochemistry\nwas, for me, basically two years spent\nstudying proteins, and one year in the\nManagement School, to deal with the\ntrauma.\nI graduated in 2010.

Yet, there are no more\nhoops to jump through, no more do\nthis coursework or pass that exam; no\nmore levels of this academic adventure,\nor that fluorescent light bulb moment.\nThe chains that reined in the horse are\nremoved, and suddenly \u2026 whoosh. The\nhorse doesn\u2019t know where to go. Why\nisn\u2019t there someone telling you what to\ndo!?\nAfter Imperial, everything is easy -working, mastering, projecting. That\u2019s\nwhy being an alumnus and being involved in gazillion different projects is\nthe norm. Or perhaps, some of us are\nthose strange species of workaholics\nwho are actually addicted to (and might\nI add in confession, get an adrenalin\nrush out of) working, projecting, and\nhobbying (as well as opinionating).\nWith your shiny degree, you would\nthink you know a lot, have seen a lot,\nand damn the world \u2013 you\u2019re going to\nmake it through. Eventually, you mature\nand actually grow up. For real this time.\nAs you realise, there is so much to\nlearn, and not enough hours in the day\nto get everything done, but despite everything you still make time for the important stuff. You also learn to handle\nironing: smooth and without creases.\nIn retrospect, if I had to do my degree\nall over again, I would be fearless, take\npart in a lot more activities, branch out\nS\no it\u2019s two weeks in, and\nthings aren\u2019t going as you\nplanned. It isn\u2019t exactly\nhow it was sold to you.\nSure, you\u2019ve been out\nmost nights, met a million people you\ncan\u2019t remember, been a bit of a tourist and burnt a few meals. But you\u2019ve\nalso missed more 9am lectures than\nyou made it to, piled up a mountain of\nwork, and have come to realise that you\nare no longer one of the elite. Yes, you,\nthe geek extraordinaire with a billion A\nlevels, are average. You\u2019ve finally met\na group of like-minded people, and all\nit\u2019s done is deflate your ego. You\u2019re just\na fish in a very large pond, more like a\nlake actually, maybe the Serpentine in\nHyde Park now you mention it.\nYou\u2019ve walked past the library (to\nfind something to eat after you\u2019ve\nsomehow burnt your spag bol), and\nnoticed the pale, hopeless faces of the\nmasses already stacked inside. Why are\nthey all still working at 1am? Do they\nknow something you don\u2019t? Why didn\u2019t\nthey tell you it would be so hard? Suddenly, you miss your mum, the dog and\neven the batty old neighbour next door.\nRelax. In two more weeks you won\u2019t\nremember this freak out. You\u2019ll feel\nlike you\u2019ve known your new friends\nyour whole life, and won\u2019t know how\nyou ever lived without them. The library will become your new haunting\nground \u2013 so many floors to socialise\non, it\u2019s a good job it\u2019s open twenty-four\nhours. Right now, everything is new.\nYou\u2019re settling in. Hold off on that\ntuition fee refund request. Look just\na little closer, and you\u2019ll see things\ndifferently. Those people stacked in\nthere? They\u2019re on Facebook; their\nflat-mate forgot to call for Sky Broadband. Their faces are hopeless because they\u2019re more hung-over than\nthey ever imagined possible. It was\ntheir society social last night, and the\nnight before that it was a house party\nof an acquaintance. Everyone eats in\nthe library caf\u00e9, not because they\u2019re\nchained to the library, but because in\nthe middle of South Ken, it\u2019s a pretty cheap option. See how easily that\ndreary image dissolves? Now it seems\nImperial really is just like any other\nUni.\nSure I probably shouldn\u2019t write\nanything disparaging about Imperial;\nyou\u2019ve only just started and it\u2019s intimidating enough without listening to a\ndisillusioned third year. But I decided,\nas with most things in life, that honesty\nis the best policy. University is over-whelming, but it\u2019s also the best thing\nyou will ever do in your life. Yes we\u2019ve\nall heard the myths about Imperial. We\nall know the stereotype. Let\u2019s take a\nmoment to look at it anyway. Imagine\nhim:\n1. He\u2019s painfully introverted. Then\nwhy is everyone walking around in\nand actually enjoy my time at Imperial.\nIn fact, I should\u2019ve regularly gone to\nMindy Lee\u2019s art workshops in Blythe,\nand been more proactive on the History\nof Art humanities course in the twentieth century liaison at UCL, as well as\ncommunicating with fellow humans a\nLOT more. Shyness gets you nowhere,\nneither does awkwardness, neither does\ngeekiness for that matter.\nWhen you start your degree, and\nthroughout it, just remember a little\nfact: you\u2019re still a baby. Focus on your\nstudies and appreciate that your parents\nand lecturers care about you. In the real\nworld, you\u2019ll grow up fast enough.\nIn a bittersweet way, graduating is a\nprocess in the coming of age ceremo-nies. Welcome to the real world, inde-pendence, toughness, explorations and\nthe make-a-difference-to-the-world-especially-now-Mother-Teresa-is-no-longer-with-us feeling. Don\u2019t forget\nyou\u2019re a citizen of our society - define\nit and make positive ripples in the pond,\nbefore you explore the ocean as a grown\nup. Even if you still sleep with the light\non.\ngroups? Surely they\u2019d all be friendless?\nWhy is Queen\u2019s Lawn always humming with chatter? Even in summer\nterm when exam timetables demand we\nare our most anti-social?\n2. He\u2019s Einstein bright. That Keeno\nfrom the front row of your lectures\nwon\u2019t get grades any higher than yours.\nPromise. It\u2019s just how he rolls.\n3. He\u2019s definitely male. You\u2019re not really reading this article then, because I\ncan\u2019t be from Imperial if I\u2019m a girl, and\nI can\u2019t be a girl if I\u2019m from Imperial.\nObviously.\nImperial-schmerial. The stereotype is\nlargely myth, but that won\u2019t stop us all\nfrom propagating it. The truth though,\nis that Imperial is up there with the best.\nIt\u2019s going to work as hard for you over\nyour lifetime as you do for it in those\nfour short undergraduate years. It\u2019s\nworth working hard at having fun here.\nCongratulations on arriving/returning\nfor 2011/2012. Make it count!\nKeep your gowns on if you\u2019re unemployed. Thug life\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 9\nFriday 21 october 2011\nCloaking with carbon nanotubes\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Europe and North America experienced\nmuch severer winters than we do now\n\u2013 people could frequently walk or even\nskate across a frozen Thames. This period is called the Little Ice Age, though\nunlike true ice ages, it had its origins\nin the waning strength of our sun and\nit was only experienced in isolated regions with a minor global temperature\nchange. Whereas the millennial changes\nin the sun were responsible for this pe-riod, a team of scientists from the Met\nOffice, Oxford and Imperial have attributed current cool winters to the smaller\n11 year solar cycle.\nVisible and infra-red light do not vary\nmuch during solar cycles, meaning the\ndirect temperature change is small.\nHowever the fluctuation of the UV light\nis much greater. UV radiation is both\nabsorbed by ozone and helps to create\nit; this process is what warms the middle of the atmosphere where the ozone\nis concentrated. The team of scientists\nused recent measurements of the UV\nradiation, which showed an even larger\nUV change than previously expected, to\ndrive a climate model. They found that\nthe recent decrease in solar UV caused\ncooling in Northern Europe and southern North America during winter, whilst\nnorthern North America and southern\nEurope warmed in the model, which\nagreed with real life.\nThe model showed that these surface changes were linked to the direct\ncooling of the middle atmosphere by a\nnetwork of dynamical adjustments that\nweakened the Northern Hemisphere\nwesterly winds at the bottom of the\natmosphere. This causes the observed\ntemperature changes, for example: by\nblowing less warm oceanic air from the\nAtlantic onto Northern Europe the climate to cool.\nThis work demonstrates that the 11\nyear cycle in the sun\u2019s strength can\nhave noticeable effects on our winters\nand could have considerably contributed to the last two severe winters here.\nHowever, one of the research\u2019s authors,\nAdam Scaife, highlights how \u201cThis\nisn\u2019t the sole driver of winter climate\nover our region, but it is a significant\nfactor and understanding it is important\nfor seasonal to decadal forecasting\u201d. It\nshould also be noted, that like the Little\nIce Age, the overall global temperature\nchange during the cycle was small, as\nthe regional changes mentioned cancel\neach other out - meaning it has no effect\non global climate change.\nBy recreating the naturally occurring\neffect of a mirage in the lab, researchers have hit upon a way to create\ncloaking devices that work for visible\nlight, effectively making objects invisible when viewed from certain an-gles. Now, let\u2019s just try to get through\nthis without mentioning Harry Potter.\nA mirage \u2013 like you often see on the\nsurface of roads in the heat \u2013 occurs\nbecause light moves slightly faster\nthrough a medium when it\u2019s hotter\nand, therefore, less dense. The difference in temperature between the\nair near a hot road surface and the air\nhigher up makes light bend on its way\nto your eyes. When deflected in this\nway, light travelling from something\nabove the road \u2013 the sky, in a typical\ndesert mirage \u2013 can reach you from\nthe angle of the road surface, creating\nan odd visual effect.\nDr. Ali Aliev and colleagues at the\nNanotech Institute at the University\nof Dallas, Texas, have recreated this\neffect by using electrically heated\nsheets of carbon nanotubes. These\nwafer-thin sheets \u2013 around 20 micrometers thick \u2013 prove to be very\neffective at heating a surrounding me-dium, creating steep mirage-inducing\ntemperature gradients near their sur-face. Due to the temperature inertia of\nthe nanotube sheets, the temperature\ngradient can also be easily modulated\nresulting in different degrees of deflection for the light hitting the gra-dient.\nThe researchers explored the mirage effect by measuring the angular\ndeflection of a laser beam directed\nparallel to the sheet\u2019s surface. They\nfound that deflection works for light\nin the UV to infrared range, a significantly greater range than for previous\ncloaking techniques. Carbon nanotube\nsheets are particularly good at producing light deflection because of their\nexceptionally high thermal interaction\nwith surrounding media, caused in\nturn by the high internal surface area\nand high thermal conductivity of the\nindividual nanotubes.\nAliev and colleagues also compared\nthe de\ufb02ection of light across different\nmedia, finding, for example, that the\ndeflection angle in helium is much\nsmaller than in air or argon, which\nis consistent with the low refractive\nindex and high thermal diffusivity\nof helium. Overall, however, larger\nangles of deflection are produced in\nthe higher density of a liquid than a\ngas, making the cloaking effect more\npronounced in water than air, for in-stance. On the other hand, the higher\ndensity of a liquid increases the heat\ncapacity of system and correspondingly reduces the obtainable rate for\ntemperature modulation and, thus, angle of deflection.\nThe most obvious application of this\nkind of technology is in cloaking devices for submarines and other stealth\nvehicles. Unsurprisingly, the work\nwas partly funded by an Of\ufb01ce of Naval Research MURI grant and an Air\nForce Of\ufb01ce of Scienti\ufb01c Research\ngrant. But Aliev has also shown, in a\npaper published last year in Nano Letters, that modulating the temperature\nof the same carbon nanotube sheets\nproduces sound waves. He has suggested this aspect could have useful\napplications in sonar technology for\ndeep-sea exploration \u2013 and, of course,\nfor finding those invisible subma-rines. On the other hand, it might also\nbe possible to make these sheets into\nloudspeakers, as Chinese researchers demonstrated two years ago by\nmaking a speaker out of a flag (look\nfor \u201ccarbon nanotube speaker\u201d on\nYouTube). It appears we now have a\nwhole new potential for loud clothing.\nAliev and colleagues published their\nlatest results last week in the journal\nNanotechnology.\nDouglas Heaven\nMaking up roughly 20% of the air we\nbreathe in, oxygen is one of the most\nabundant elements on Earth. It is used\nby all forms of life for respiration, which\nprovides the energy organisms use to\ngrow, repair and live. However, it has\nnot always been in such plentiful supply.\nInitially, when the Earth \ufb01nished forming (I say \ufb01nished, it is actually constantly changing and adapting) 3.5 billion\nyears ago, the surface was a blistered\nmass of volcanoes spewing magma and\ngas out into the open. There occurred an\nevent, named the Great Oxidation Event\nwhich resulted in oxygen of the atmosphere and the beginning of air as we\nknow it now. Most \ufb01gures indicated this\nto have occurred c2.5 billion years ago\nand there has been much speculation as\nto what caused this event, which eventually lead to the development of life on\nEarth.\nMost commonly, the starting point for\noxygen generation is sulphur from vol-canoes.At the time, most submarine volcanoes produced gas with low sulphur\ncontent, but as the global sea level began\nto drop, more of the Earth\u2019s was exposed\nto the surface and the exposed volcanoes produced gas with a much higher\nsulphur content, particularly sulphur di-oxide. The gases eventually dissolved in\nseawater and broke down forming bubbles of oxygen in the water, which we\nknow can be used to sustain life \u2013 most\n\ufb01sh and marine wildlife uses the oxygen\ndissolved in water in order to respire.\nBy analysing rock strata from around\nthis era, paleochemists found that a certain isotope of sulphur (\u039433S) indicated\na lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. This\nisotope disappeared around the time of\nthe Great Oxidation Event and the emergence of the O2 molecule radically altered the redox-based biochemical processes beforehand. Further analysis of\nthe data showed that the trigger for this\nisotope may have been the redox ratio\nbetween the two sulphur-based gases\nreleased by volcanoes \u2013 sulphur dioxide\n(SO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S).\nA higher ratio of SO2/H2S produces\nsigni\ufb01cantly more of the MIF isotope.\nAs the composition of volcanic gases\nchanged, there led to more oxidized gases and so lower \u039433S.\nKump and Barley, two geoscientists\nfrom Pennsylvania State University and\nthe University of Western Australia in\nCrawley, respectively, have been analysing data for some time in this \ufb01eld \u2013 speci\ufb01cally using carbon dating techniques.\nThey argued that subaerial volcanic\ngases are more oxidized than submarine\nones and proposed an increasing impact\nfrom subaerial volcanoes would have\nresulted in increasingly oxidizing volcanic emissions. However, some question their results, saying that the \ufb02uids\nfrom the sea\ufb02oor that Kump and Barely\nused to de\ufb01ne the redox at the time of\nthe Great Oxidation Event was \u201cpoorly\nconstrained\u201d. Other also argue that it is\nnot redox conditions altering the SO2/\nH2S ratio, but gas pressure.\nFurther analysis into this phenomenon\nrequires us to consider various gas equations in competition, each struggling to\nbecome dominant as the global temperature and pressure changed. Rather than\nbore you with too many more \ufb01gures\nand equations, it is easier to describe that\nduring the period 2-3 billion years ago,\nglobal sea levels did fall and a combination of the changing degassing pressure\nand higher proportion of subaerial volcanoes led to a higher proportion of both\nsulphur dioxide and hydrogen in the air,\nas well as amounts of carbon dioxide.\nCompeting processes of thermochemi-cal reactions led eventually to dominance of water vapour and ultimately the\nfall of sulphur altogether.And with more\noxygen, breeds life.\nPavitar Devgon\nMini \u2018little ice age\u2019\nperiods explained\nThe prize for identifying Diamond is a smug sense of satisfaction\nOn the oxidation of Earth\u2019s atmosphere...\nWant to write for\nFelix Science?\nEmail us!\nLuke Sheldon\n\n"

The series of\nfriendlies played against a combination\nof UCL and the RSM provided valuable\nexperience for ICHC and an opportunity for the freshers to impress and show\nwhat they were capable of.\nThe matches at home did not end\nwell for Imperial as Fortress Harlington failed to live up to its name.

The contest against UCL\nMen\u2019s 1s therefore provided an opportunity to try out a host of new tactics revolving around a new system of\nplay.

With a squad of 14, including 6 freshers, IC started the game\nbrightly. A host of surging attacks\nfrom the right piled on the pressure\nand IC forced a short corner. Unfortunately, a fumble with the stop led to\nUCL winning the ball and scoring a\nbreakaway goal. IC tried to get back\non level terms and played very good\nhockey, however, they could not stop\na second UCL goal; 2-0 being the final\nscore.

While the music policy\nis slightly questionable, it\u2019s difficult to not be drawn in by the festival\u2019s Wonderland-like aesthetic.\nSet around a lake in the Cambridgeshire\ncountryside, the festival area is decorated with\nenchanting lights and quirky sculptures. There\nare a lot of spots that lend themselves to simply lying down and chilling out. There\u2019s also an\nimpressive selection of \u201cstuff\u201d to wander in and\nout of, ranging from theatrical performances to\nmud wrestling to mini science fairs.\nThe festival harbours an ambiance of mellowed permissiveness, not quite as all consuming as the organisers\u2019 crackpot ramblings\nwould have you imagine, but certainly more\nso than other festivals. Seemingly insignificant additions like being able to swim in the\nlake without the bother of some abrasive safety\nwarning make this all the more noticeable.\nFittingly, for the unrushed dynamic, the musical acts this year weren\u2019t the type to get you\nfrantically arranging meeting times. Of course\nCan you keep a Secret?\ncus Nasty. Besides this, the general trend was\nmiddle-of-the-road indie-folk by day, distinctly\ninaccessible techno by night.\nIn short, going to Secret Garden Party is like\nordering a Sunday roast and only being served\nthe trimmings. It\u2019s good fun - but come next\nyear if you can find a picturesque lake that\ndoesn\u2019t cost \u00a3160 to hang around for a week-end, go with that.\nthis itself wasn\u2019t an issue; in fact it\u2019s very refreshing to go to a festival where there\u2019s no\npressure to see a performance. However, rather\nthan \u2018up and coming\u2019 many of the artists were\nmore \u2018down and going\u2019. The \u2018big\u2019 names that\ndid perform \u2013 Blondie and Alabama 3 \u2013 managed decent sets despite poor sound quality on\nthe main stage. A few favourites put on a great\nshow: XXXY, Mosca, Dark Sky and MarBeen spending Friday nights, living in a hipster\u2019s paradise\nKina Grannis is a California-based American\nsinger-songwriter and YouTube sensation. She\nbegan performing to her stuffed animals from\nthe age of four, before progressing to her video\ncamera, and finally to people. This month, she is\non the European leg of her world tour. She also\nplans on touring Southeast Asia and Australia\nlater in the year.\nIn 2008, she won the \u2018Doritos Crash the Super\nBowl\u2019 contest, and signed onto Interscope Records. A year later, she left the record label in\norder to pursue her musical vision as an independent artist. Her new album, Stairwells, was\nreleased in April of this year. The album name is\na reference to her college days, when she often\nsat in secluded stairwells to make music. Kina\ndescribes her style as a happy medium between\npop, folk and indie. Her elegant vocals and the\nunique charm she brings to her music set her\napart from other guitar-playing singer-songwrit-ers.\nShe recently played her first London show to a\nsold-out audience at the Monto Water Rats. The\nvenue was small and intimate \u2013 perfect for her\nsolo acoustic guitar set. The opening act was fellow YouTuber Imaginary Friend, whose haunting vocals and simple guitar accompaniment\nwere well-received.\nKina\u2019s performance began with her walking\nbarefoot onstage to cheers and applause from\nher fans (or, as she affectionately calls them, her\n\u2018kinerds\u2019). She opened with \u2018World in Front of\nKina finished the show with her audience\nsinging along to the excellent \u2018Message From\nYour Heart\u2019, the song that won her the Super\nBowl contest. She ended the evening with a\nmeet and greet for her kinerds, many of them\nwalking away clutching several signed copies of\nStairwells.\nKina Grannis returns to London later this\nmonth to play the last show on her European\ntour before flying back to America.\nMe\u2019, the first track on Stairwells, and a fitting\nfirst song to play on her London debut. In between jokes, anecdotes and guitar-tuning, she\nplayed fan favourites, such as \u2018Valentine\u2019, \u2018The\nOne You Say Goodnight To\u2019 and \u2018Cambridge\u2019.\nThe audience was also treated to interesting\nrenditions of \u2018Oops I Did it Again\u2019 and Coolio\u2019s \u2018Gangsta\u2019s Paradise\u2019, the latter of which\ninvolved certain amounts of rapping (a slightly\nsurreal experience).\nThere\u2019s nothing more hardcore punk than having a\ncreed to live by. The straight-edge subculture \u2013 an\nabstention from drugs, promiscuous sex, and often\nhair \u2013 was a creed of sorts, inspired by the anti-hedonistic stance of 1980s bands such as Minor\nThreat, and many bands have adopted the stance\nof political revolutionaries.\nBut Refused (1991-1998), a hardcore punk band\nfrom Sweden, wrote manifestos. A typical liner note\nproclaims \u201cthe art produced by Refused is a weapon in the service of the struggle and an inseparable\npart of it\u201d.\nTheir final press release, announcing their split,\nbegins: \u201cJust like the political theorists and philoso-phers...we also managed with a sort of self-fulfilling\nprophecy. A manifestation of an idea to a concrete\naction\u201d. But they believed in their own pretensions,\nthey backed every word of their cod-theoretical cant\nwith an intensity of songwriting and performance\nthat made you believe it too.\nRefused started out on This Just Might Be The\nTruth (1994) as a good European version of The Nation of Ulysses. Like their American counterparts,\ntheirs was a punk that had roots in the protest song:\nSongs to Fan the Flames of Discontent (1996) which\ntook its name from a 1909 songbook from the Industrial Workers of the World.\nBut it is for The Shape of Punk to Come (1998) that\nthey truly matter. A few years ago Kerrang! ranked\nthis album at #13 on their \u201c50 Most Influential Albums of All Time\u201d. Yeah, who cares about Kerrang!\nand who cares about lists? Few people noticed The\nShape of Punk to Come when it came out \u2013 it lives\ninstead, as it\u2019s title proclaimed it would, in the hardcore scene of today.\nRefused songs are full of complex rhythms and\nstomach-lurching dynamics. In The Shape of Punk to\nCome they also play around with electronica and jazz\nand the kind of studio production that normally kills\na band of this persuasion. Here it\u2019s done so artfully,\nfitted so well to the songs, and without loss of inten-sity, that it lifts this record atmospheres above the\nangry, shouty street-punk kids they\u2019d grown from.\nBut most importantly, Refused could write pop\nhooks worthy of ABBA. Take \u2018Summer Holidays vs\nPunk Routine\u2019 from their last album: sandwiched between churning guitars, you\u2019re hit by a euphoric rush\nmore uplifting than anything you\u2019ll find in Ibiza.\nRefused broke up in 1998, bitter, disenchanted,\nand tired. True to their grounded roots, they played\ntheir last show in the basement of a friend\u2019s house.\nWhen the police raided the party and shut the band\ndown, they saw it as a liberation.\nA few mp3s can downloaded from www.burningheart.\ncom/refused/index.html but you should buy The\nShape of Punk to Come immediately.\nPunk Planet by\nDouglas Heaven\nThis week: Refused\nKina Grannis in London\nAh man, that was dog\u2019s mess that I just stepped in.

This has a direct effect on\nthe type of students who end up studying STEM subjects at university, with\nImperial in particular attracting fewer\nand fewer students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.\nTeach First is an independent charity\nfocused on delivering far-reaching so-better job satisfaction, security, lifestyle\nor long holidays?\u201d And, whilst the average starting salary of a teacher is below\nImperial\u2019s graduate average, it is still\npossible to progress rapidly in to positions of leadership within schools, with\nsalary scales for head teachers in inner\nLondon schools reaching upwards of\n\u00a3100,000. Additionally, Britain isn\u2019t the\nonly country struggling with a lack of\nSTEM teachers \u2013 lots of British STEM\ngraduates end up immigrating to Australia or New Zealand to teach. But\nthe most important thing, according to\nCarlos, is that \u201cteaching is a vocational\nthing, and if you love what you do then\nmoney shouldn\u2019t really come into it\u201d.\na good middle ground, since there is no\nobligation to stay in teaching after the\ntwo year programme, thus keeping your\noptions wide open. As third year physicist Elwin Carlos points out, \u201cTeach\nFirst is creating a movement for change,\ninnovation and inspiration, not just in\nthe classroom, but in the boardroom, the\ngovernment and across society\u201d.\nSalary is undeniably a leading reason\nwhy graduates tend to stay away from\nteaching, and to students for whom\nsalary is the biggest consideration, careers in banking or consultancy might\nlook more attractive. However, as Hunt\npoints out, \u201care those jobs going to give\nyou a chance to change people\u2019s lives,\ncial change by addressing educational\ndisadvantage \u2013 driving up standards\nand raising aspirations in schools facing challenging circumstances. They\nhave their sights set on Imperial College to help combat the so-called\n\u201cSTEM challenge\u201d.\nOver the last nine years, Teach First\nhas been strengthening their connections with Imperial, and has taken on\n89 Imperial graduates into the Teach\nFirst Leadership Development Programme (LDP). This year Teach First\naims to recruit around 1000 graduates\nand experienced professionals to the\nLDP, with just under half of all recruits\ncoming from a STEM background.\nTeach First currently have three student brand managers at Imperial: students who promote awareness of Teach\nFirst across campus, whether through\npromoting events, shout-outs in lectures or working with staff.\nFelix got in touch with these brand\nmanagers, and asked them about their\nexperiences.\nDouglas Hunt, a fourth year chemist,\nwas drawn into what he describes as\nan \u201cinnovative graduate programme\u201d\nafter getting involved in teaching with\nthe Student Associates Scheme (a now-terminated scheme in which students\nspent fifteen days in schools as teaching\nassistants). He acknowledges that many\nstudents might not think of teaching as a\nlifelong career, but Teach First provides\nFEATURE\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nC\nan you think of any reason\nwhy an Imperial student\nmight want to become\na teacher?\u201d \u201cThey got a\nthird class, maybe?\u201d This\nresponse from a second year mathematician may well sum up the opinions\nof some Imperial students, and indeed\na section of society\u2019s wider opinion of\nthe profession. We\u2019ve all heard the age-old adage, \u201cif you can\u2019t do; teach\u201d. And,\nwith the starting salary for teaching being significantly lower than the average\nstarting salary for Imperial graduates,\nnot to mention challenging classroom\nconditions, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine why\nthe UK faces its largest shortage of\nScience, Technology, Engineering and\nMaths (STEM) teachers. \u201cYou\u2019d be at\nthe bottom of society. You\u2019d be in your\ncrappy Smart car and everyone would\nbe looking at you\u201d, the mathematician\ncontinues. This week we challenge\nsome of the misconceptions surrounding teaching, and ask why more Imperial graduates don\u2019t generally consider\nteaching as an acceptable career option.\nFirstly, why is Britain\u2019s lack of STEM\nteachers such a problem? According to\nTeach First, a charity that directs high\ncalibre graduates towards teaching disadvantaged children, \u201c46% of employers are concerned that they will not be\nable to fill posts in their organisations\nthat require graduate or higher level\nSTEM qualifications\u201d. In order to tackle the STEM professional shortage, one\nneeds to understand just why there is\nsuch a low uptake of STEM graduates\ninto teaching or STEM careers gener-ally. And with the UK\u2019s international\nranking in Science and Maths compulsory education steadily declining in recent years, it has never been more important to address the issue.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be at the\nbottom of society.\nEveryone would be\nlooking at you\u201d\nThe unused green chalk looks on enviously at his academically superior comrade\nMatthew Colvin\nWHY SHOULD\nYOU GO INTO\nTEACHING?\nTeach First\n6 FELIX\nFriday 21 OCTOBER 2011\nAcademia: over on the other side\nOf course, there is one group of Imperial students who will certainly end\nup teaching, though they might consider it a mere aside to their primary\nvocation. Academics, whether they love it or hate it, spend large amounts\nof their time teaching. Some might regard this as a drop in the ocean\nwhen compared to the demands of research work, but such a view is\nmisguided; aspirant lecturers should be careful not to underestimate the\nprimacy teaching will assume in their work.\nCertainly there are big differences between the classroom and the lecture theatre. The material is more advanced, while students are (for the\nmost part) easier to handle. Putting ideas across is a lot more straightforward when your audience is actually interested.\nIn some respects, then, teaching at university level is a more detached\naffair. Students are largely expected to be self-motivated and to take\nresponsibility for their own work. Because of this, the necessary skills\ndiffer from school teaching, with a greater emphasis on command of the\nsubject, as opposed to engagement with pupils.\nMany academics rate teaching very highly. One anonymous lecturer\ntold Felix: \u201cteaching is one of the main perks of the job.\u201d Another interestingly noted that \u201cit is a commonly observed fact in the academic community that engaging in teaching while doing research ... often enhances\nthat research.\u201d So the two certainly are not mutually opposing interests.\nKaty Bettany, Matt Colvin, Navid Nabijou and\nDeepka Rana investigate Imperial\u2019s preconceptions\nwith a profession keen to take on some of the\ncountry\u2019s top science graduates\n\u201cTeach First is trying\nto create a movement for change and\ninnovation\u201d\n\n"

Families are out, the squirrels are being pretty inquisitive and the pedal boats on the lake\nare politely bumping into each other. In the middle\nof it all, a sprawling white structure with a pretty\nweird wooden entrance, out of which snakes a long\nqueue. Next to it sits the entrance for people who already have tickets - little groups of stylishly dressed\n(to not use the word arty) people filter into the airy\nwhite tent in pretty excited fashion.\nWelcome to Frieze art fair.\nI have slowly been discovering the world of contemporary art over the past couple of years, and\ntrying (but generally failing) to \u201cget\u201d it. I thought\nthat going to Frieze, and seeing how the art world\nworks for myself, might help the process somewhat\n\u2013 it would also be a chance to see the very bleeding\nedge in contemporary art and see what artists are up\nto at the moment. If you\u2019re still wondering what it is,\nFrieze art fair is an annual event that brings together\nthe biggest galleries and collectors in the world to\nshowcase (and sell) the latest contemporary art.\nWhy is it such a big deal?\nFor starters, it\u2019s pretty big. Walking in, you get\nan impression of bustle, and a sort of unfocused\npurpose \u2013 everyone is walking around, observing\nthe artworks (and each other), emitting an opinion,\ntaking pictures. In fact, to the layman, that is what\nsets it apart from any old museum exhibition at first\nglance: people are snapping away at the things they\nlike, and the interest in some pieces is tangible.\nThe sheer size of the place gets to you after a\narts editors, I began wandering around.\nDescribing what I saw would take a catalogue,\nor rather more simply, a camera. There was so\nmuch on display, spanning so many artistic influ-ences, sub-genres and mediums of expression, that\nit would be impossible to sum it up.\nPosters, sculptures, videos, collages\u2026the (in)\nfamous boat (exemplifying \u201cready-made art\u201d,\napparently), the shadow-of-a-banana-that-is-sup-posed-to-look-like-a-wine-bottle or even a pair of\nturntables playing random static in a loop were all\n\u201cart\u201d, and it was all for sale.\nI enjoyed it a lot, though. Stepping through the\nentrance was like entering a parallel world, where\nthe usual rules don\u2019t apply. For contemporary art-ists, it\u2019s all about capturing an idea, drawing attention to something that is usually overlooked, or\nseeing something from a different angle. This can\nlead to the creation of pieces that can either strike\na strong chord with the viewer or that just seem\nvery silly. The beauty of an event on the scale of\nFrieze is that there will almost always be a piece\nfor everyone (check out our favourites on these\npages).\nI\u2019m still not sure I \u201cget\u201d contemporary art \u2013 but\nFrieze has made me eager to see more.\nPersonally, one of my favourite pieces was \u2018So\u201cI\u2019m still not sure I \u2018get\u2019\ncontemporary art - but\nFrieze has made me eager\nto see more\u201d\nIndy Leclercq\nA Saturday afternoon in the park\nlar Catastrophe\u2019 by Jennifer Allora and Guillermo\nCalzadilla a collaborative duo who represented\nthe USA at this year\u2019s Venice biennale. A collage\nof broken solar cells on canvas, arranged to form a\ngeometric pattern, it was very striking visually but\nalso served as a reminder that while progress has\nbeen made, solar panels have been touted as a big\nsource of renewable energy for a while without\nthere having been that much concrete progress.\nTrouser presses and biros are not friends\nFrieze Art Fair 101: A novice\u2019s impressions\nCarsten Nikolai\u2019s work deals with the\nunderlying randomness of life, and the\nbeauty that it can occasionally give rise to.\nHis work on grids, published in a book that\ncan only be described as art, is fascinating\nand beautiful. Grid Index is the product of\nlong research into the codes that rule over\nthe production of grids and patterns. The\nunpredictability is what I find most appealing \u2013 a grid with a regular patter develops\nareas of absolute but wonderful madness.\nAlso at Frieze was a series of works\ncalled \u2018batterie random dot\u2019, made in\n2011. Glass plates with positive and negative transparent prints of entirely random\ndots were placed on top of each other.\nOnly some dots are visible from the top\nand therefore, the rest of the work remains\nan unsolvable mystery.\nI am not entirely sure why the works of\nCarsten Nikolai appeal so to my aesthetic\ntastes. Perhaps because their simplicity\nis deceptive - one is first drawn in by the\nelegance and perfection, and only later begins to understand the concealed mean-ing.\nCarsten Nikolai\nThat\u2019s strange, Google Maps says this is Starbucks\nCommissioned specially for Frieze Art Fair, Elena Bajo\u2019s piece \u2018The Pervasive Element\u2019 was carefully planned and executed to engaging\nresult. A long piece of cardboard, which was placed on the grounds of Regent\u2019s Park during the construction of the massive tent that was\nto house Freize, was picked up by the artist and rolled up. It contained the imprinted footsteps of the workers who had walked over it in\nthat period. In a way, \u2018The Pervasive Element\u2019 was a time capsule; it captured not only a moment in time, but also a sentiment that was\ncertainly no longer present at Frieze by the time the VIPs rolled around. A beautifully edited and collaged newspaper detailing the installation was handed out to the public \u2013 a free and very special souvenir (you even had to pay for water at Frieze).\nElena Bajo at D + T Project\nIdris Khan at Victoria Miro Gallery\nI really loved the piece by Khan at Victoria Miro. It consisted of photographs of musical scores, which had then\nbeen layered over one another to create a blurred effect.\nKhan simulates the lives of musicians using their musical\nscores. For example, he created a piece in 2005, using\nBeethoven\u2019s sonatas, in which their layered photographs\neventually created a wall of almost total blackness, symbolising Beethoven\u2019s deafness. Khan also borrows from\nbooks, as well as using his own words, to create works\nthat perhaps bring different aspects of the original work\nto light. Unfortunately, there were few pieces by him at\nFrieze, but what was exhibited certainly made the cut.\nARTS\nwhile. Picking up a map at the entrance, it doesn\u2019t\nseem that big; when you realize that in an hour\nyou\u2019ve only seen 5 galleries out of the 173 presenting work, the fact that it\u2019s set over four days makes\nsense. The fair is laid out as a series of stands (which\ncover about 20 square meters on average), all numbered and set up in neat rows. Despite the orderli-ness, it\u2019s all a bit daunting to the neophyte. Armed\nwith recommendations from your ever-dependable\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 21 october 2011 19\nCOMMENT\nI\ndon\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard, but\nthere\u2019s an exhibition on at the\nV&A at the moment. You know,\nthat nice building on the other\nside of Exhibition road \u2013 the\none that has \u201cart\u201d and \u201cdesign\u201d in it. If\nyou\u2019re a fresher, and you haven\u2019t paid it\na visit yet, that\u2019s fair enough. I do suggest you go at some point in your next\nthree (or four) years \u2013 it\u2019s just across the\nstreet, and you\u2019d be surprised at how\nrefreshing a bit of \u201csomething that isn\u2019t\nscience\u201d can be. If you\u2019re not a fresher,\nand you haven\u2019t been yet, go \u2013 if only\nto ogle at/try and chat up one of the fit\nart students taking notes at the latest\nexhibition (also it\u2019s a refreshing change\nfrom Imperial).\nI was at the V&A at the weekend \u2013 not\nfor the above reasons \u2013 for their new exhibition on postmodernism. Before you\nstop reading this in disgust, let me just\nsay two things: this is not a review of\nthe exhibition, because I know next to\nnothing about art, and what the fuck is\npostmodernism? Your guess is as good\nas mine, mate.\nMaybe the exhibition could provide an answer? The main thing I got\nout of wandering through weirdly lit,\nhigh-ceilinged rooms for an hour and\na half was this: No-one effing knows\nwhat postmodernism is. Apparently,\nyou can ask fifty different people who\nTim Arbabzadah\nIndy Leclercq\nWould I be THIS hot with glasses? Meh.\nPostmodernism... wait, don\u2019t run away!\nare knowledgeable about this kind of\nthing and you\u2019ll get fifty different an-swers. Fifty different \u201cvalid\u201d answers. It\nmakes my physicist brain start twitching nervously; which is, apparently, the\nwhole point. So, there\u2019s a word describing something that everyone (read: art\nboffins) can relate to but that no-one can\nreally define. Honestly, as far as intellectual abstraction and weird concepts\ngo, quantum mechanics has nothing on\npostmodernism.\nOne way of approaching it, I\u2019m told, is\nby using modernism as a starting point.\nEverything that modernism stands for,\npostmodernism wants to subvert, de-stroy, and turn on its head.\nThis was pretty evident at the exhi-bition, with posters, paintings, clothes\nand various household items that most\npeople would call \u2018weird\u2019 but are apparently just \u2018postmodern\u2019. You can make a\nprefab garage with elements of classical\nGreek architecture, encase a turntable\nand some speakers in industrial con-crete, or make a chair that only a one-legged dwarf would be able to fit into\nand call all of it postmodern.\nYou can also make Blade Runner, or\nform Kraftwerk: yep, that\u2019s postmodern too. All the weird fashion trends in\nthe eighties? Bizarre buildings? About\nfive hundred weird teapots? The word\nyou\u2019re looking for starts with a \u2018p\u2019 and\nD\no you wear glasses? It\nseems like a decent proportion of the population do. If my unscien-tific, empirical study of\nlooking around sometimes (leave the\nhardcore, well researched science for\nlectures) and thinking, \u201cshit, a lot of\npeople wear glasses\u201d (I\u2019m all eloquent\nlike that, my parents are very proud)\ncounts for anything then I have definitive evidence that a non negligible\nnumber of the population wear glasses.\nIt seems that a lot of people don\u2019t have\n20/20 vision. As a side note, that\u2019s a\nphrase that I find odd. Anyone who\nhas good eyes says they have that; but\nI thought it was only those with perfect\nvision. I guess it\u2019s like the way everyone over 5ft10 tells you that they\u2019re\n6ft.\nI think a guy I used to get the train to\nschool with put it elegantly one cold,\nrainy morning when he said: \u201cHaving\ncrap eyes would be well annoying\u201d. At\nthe time, my eyes weren\u2019t yet \u201ccrap\u201d,\nso I smirked along with him, laughing\nat those inferior specimens of humani-ty. Then, when I was about 17, it turned\nout I needed glasses. Karma\u2019s a bitch.\nNow I move on to my dilemma and\nwhy I turned to contact lenses. My\neyesight is not great, but it\u2019s just about\ngood enough to be able to function\nwithout glasses from a visual stand-point, although perhaps socially it\u2019s\nanother story. For example, I know\nthat things that are blurry shouldn\u2019t be\nblurry. I can see that the sign has writing on it, but I can\u2019t read the writing.\nMy eyes are such a tease.\nSometimes, I think I\u2019d prefer it if\nthere was no hope of seeing someone\u2019s\nface clearly from a short distance, rather than sharp focus being just about\nout of my reach. So, my eyes exist in\nan irritating in-between zone. If they\nwere a bit worse I would resign myself\nto the fact that I just don\u2019t have great\neyesight, and if they were slightly better I wouldn\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s basically the optical equivalent of being\nin the Friend Zone with that girl/guy\nyou really like. Thinking about it, the\nultimate all or nothing, win or lose,\nglory or failure solution to both problems probably involves copious consumption of alcohol. I\u2019ve heard horror\nstories about LASER eye surgery. If I\never have that then I\u2019m going medieval\nin terms of anesthetic \u2013 just in case.\nPutting contrived analogies aside for\na second, there is another solution to\nthe bad eyes that doesn\u2019t involve glass-es. During the summer, I actually managed to achieve one of the things I had\nplanned: I tried contact lenses. Saying\nthat, I did do it right at the end of the\nsummer, so it\u2019s only a partial victory\nfor pro-activeness.\nWhy would I do such a thing when\nmy current glasses work fine and are\nhipsterlicious? I can feel my bespectacled brothers and sisters reading in\ndisgust, thinking I\u2019m a vain sell out.\nPartially true, but also it\u2019s just nice to\nnot have to carry around glasses and\nfeel lost if you don\u2019t have them.\nI\u2019m not going to say that they have\nimmediately revolutionized my life.\nMainly because, at the minute, it takes\nends with an \u2018n\u2019.\nI\u2019m going to attract the ire of many ar-tistically-inclined people here but to be\nhonest, it seems to me that while there\nmay be some justification for it, most\nartists and designers just ran out of conventional ideas, took a lot of drugs and\nmade a bunch of weird \u201csubversive\u201d\nshit and sold it for a lot of money. Fair\nplay to them \u2013 even though the whole\nthing collapsed under its own weight\nwhen people realised they were paying\n$50,000 for a weirdly-shaped coffee\nmaker.\nI do think some postmodernist concepts are relevant to today\u2019s society,\nthough. Modernism is definitely dead;\nthere are no more ideals of machine-like\nperfection, no more utopias, and fast-paced art (and society) isn\u2019t based on\nreason and scientific thought any more.\nNow, superficial style is everything,\nart is more about meaning than artistic\nskill and the things you see in galleries,\nlike everything else, are all meant to be\n\u201cconsumed\u201d.\nIn conclusi- wait a minute. It makes\nsense now: postmodernism is basically\nThe X Factor.\nan extended period of humming the\nRocky theme tune for me to pluck up\nthe courage to put them in. Also, I\ndon\u2019t trust myself to be able to remove\nthem while drunk; wearing them on a\nnight out is therefore not yet an option.\nHopefully, practice makes perfect.\nThey do, however, have one trump\ncard: at first, every time you are wearing them, you think about how awesome it is that everything is now essentially in HD without the aid of glasses.\nMy contact lenses do seem to want to\nremind me of this fact, by starting to\ngo intermittently blurry after I\u2019ve worn\nthem for a few consecutive hours.\nThe take home message is this: book\nan appointment and try contact lenses.\nIf you\u2019re squeamish about touching\nyour eye, don\u2019t worry, a lot of people\nare, you\u2019ll get over it. Once you do you\nwill feel like an absolute boss. Besides,\nduring the start of term, when work is\nat a relative minimum, it is the best\ntime to take the plunge.\nWait, that last sentence was transfer-rable advice.\nIt was either this, or use a picture of Kraftwerk.

Instead clubs can either sell\ndrinks with a 10% discount, or sell drinks\nfor full price with 10% of the bar spend going to the club. Clubs can also pre-order\na bar tab and distribute it as \u2018tokens\u2019, but\nin order to comply with the Union\u2019s newly\nintroduced Responsible Retailing of Alcohol Code of Practice, clubs cannot provide\nmore than 8 units (or an average of 4 pints)\nof alcohol for free per person.\nThe AEB, discussing the situation in a\nUniversity College London\u2019s new proposals have s\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMatthew Colvin meeting on Monday, was unanimous in\ntheir disapproval of the new rules. One\nAEB member, wishing to remain anony-mous, told Felix that, \u2018the whole tokens\nsystem is fundamentally flawed. Unless\nyou have stewards with hawk-eyes watching everyone at every moment, there\u2019s no\nway that you can stop people moving tokens around amongst themselves. We\u2019re\nbeing told that we aren\u2019t responsible\nenough to decide how much is our limit \u2013\nfrankly it\u2019s just insulting.\u201d\nThe AEB follow in the footsteps of\ncomments made by senior members of the\nAthletics Club Committee, whose members organised an online protest, and the\nRoyal School of Mines.\nChair of the AEB, Chandana Shankar,\ncited the system as \u201cunworkable\u201d, focusing on the financial background of the sit-uation: \u201cCurrently the legal and financial\njustifications for the new bar night system\narevague.MichaelFosterneedstobackup\nhis decision with figures and facts because\ncurrently the students feel that he is using\nthem to claw back money lost through bad\ndecisions made in previous years. I feel\nthat the Union\u2019s bars should not be making\nmoney on bar nights and the only way to\nprove that they do this is by being up front\nand transparent about costings.\u201d\nPosting on his online blog on October 6,\nFoster stated the reasoning behind the introduction of the new rules, explaining that\nthe Union was \u201closing money every time a\nbar night was run, as the keg price did not\naccount for various staffing costs, including the (often quite significant) cleaning\ncosts.\u201d\nThe AEB has pledged to express the\nboard\u2019s concerns at the next meeting of\nUnion Council on Monday 31 October.\n\u00a9\n2011\nKPMG\nLLP,\na\nUK\nlimited\nliability\npartnership,\nis\na\nsubsidiary\nof\nKPMG\nEurope\nLLP\nand\na\nmember\n\ufb01rm\nof\nthe\nKPMG\nnetwork\nof\nindependent\nmember\n\ufb01rms\naf\ufb01liated\nwith\nKPMG\nInternational\nCooperative,\na\nSwiss\nentity.\nAll\nrights\nreserved.\nThe\nKPMG\nname,\nlogo\nand\n\u201ccutting\nthrough\ncomplexity\u201d\nare\nregistered\ntrademarks\nor\ntrademarks\nof\nKPMG\nInternational.\nStraight talking from KPMG.\nGraduate Programmes \u2013 All degree disciplines\nDrinks, presentation and networking\nwith KPMG\n6.30pm, Tuesday 18th October\nKPMG, Presentation Suite, 15 Canada Square,\nCanary Wharf, London E14 5GL\nwww.kpmg.co.uk/careers\nNo bull.\nDeputy President (Finance & Services) Michael\nFoster\u2019s response to Felix:\n\u201cIt is very easy to see why the AEB would not like this new procedure \u2013 I\ncan imagine no Management Group will. It represents the loss of a very\ngood deal for clubs. However, this deal was both irresponsible and unsus-tainable, and, as DPFS, it is my responsibility to ensure the future stability\nand sustainability of the Union\u2019s activities. I would hope that Management Groups take their wider responsibilities into account, and instead\nof mourning the loss of a ridiculously good deal for clubs, appreciate that\nwe all need to act sustainably to keep this Union as it is for many years\nto come.\n\u201cAs an aside, despite all the reported unhappiness with the new bar nights\nprocedure, the Royal School of Mines will soon be hosting their second\none this month, and the German Society were thrilled with their night. They\nhave, as a result, got more members than ever before, and were able to\nenjoy a great social event at the Union Bar for their whole society.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\n12 FRIDAY 21 october 2011\nA\ns we picked our way\nthrough the tents outside\nSt Paul\u2019s Cathedral this\nMonday one thing was\nclear: anarchists are not\nan easy bunch to organise. Not a surprise,\nperhaps, but add to this a passionate belief in not telling others what to do, and\nsuddenly you find yourself voting about\nwhether to vote\u2026\nWe visited the makeshift campsite for a\ncouple of hours, waiting for the General\nAssembly at 7pm. The meeting didn\u2019t\nget under way for another half hour\nwhile some organisers politely asked the\ncrowds to take a seat by the cathedral\u2019s\nimposing steps. The whole effort was\nlike herding cats but where the cats are\ndead. Throughout the meeting, organisers repeated and repeated how everything\nwas \u201cjust a suggestion\u201d. But while this\ndisorganisation was all rather cute and\nharmless, it slightly undermines the message that people in this country ought to\nhear \u2013 our economy needs change.\nThese protests are for a reason \u2013 the\nworld\u2019s economy is still in a mess. Banks\nand global financial institutions are powerless to solve this crisis. Governments\nare even more impotent. How much of\nthis can really be a surprise? We have\nmore or less the same economic system\ntoday as that which brought the economy\nto its knees just three years ago; we built\nan engine that we didn\u2019t know how to fix\nand no-one has come up with anything\ndifferent.\nIn 2008 policy makers could at least\nplead naivety; who could have seen the\nsudden collapse of the world\u2019s largest\nbanks? And who could have known the\nfull effect of this on our interconnected\ncompanies and countries?\nWell actually Joseph Stiglitz, that\u2019s\nwho. This professor of economics and\nNobel laureate was our Cassandra. He\nwas preaching long before the housing\nbubble and credit default swaps of the\ninherent dangers posed by lax legislation and misaligned incentives. His 2010\nbook Freefall, recently updated, is his\nvictory lap. But more than \u201cI told you\nso\u201d, Stiglitz offers a way out of the mire.\nPoliticians would do well to head his ad-vice. For all their vague talk about \u201cjustice\u201d, the St Paul\u2019s protestors could too.\nStiglitz lays the blame for the crisis\nsquarely at the feet of free markets and\ntheir ideologue proponents. Key to the\ncollapse of the financial system was the\nproblem of externalities, he argues. Externalities are by-products of business\nfor which there is no market mechanism\nto account - sometimes positive, sometimes negative. If I own a bee farm and\nan orchard sets up next door, the orchard\nbenefits significantly from my bees\u2019 pollination without affecting me. But should\nthe orchard owners not pay for this privi-lege? This is an externality - the market\nprovides no way of paying me. A negative externality would be global warming - harm is caused by business but not\nin a way penalised by the markets.\nStiglitz argues that banks, with their\nlight touch regulations, posed huge negative externalities on the economy as a\nwhole in a number of ways: the misunderstanding of risk, performance related\npay and implicit government subsidy.\nBefore making a loan, banks need to understand the risk associated with the borrower defaulting and adjust the interest\nrate accordingly. But to further decrease\nrisk, banks started to package loans together with assumption that the more\nloans one had, the more the risk was\nspread out. This was fine, provided defaults weren\u2019t correlated. But when house\nprices started to fall across the country,\ndefaults became very correlated indeed.\nBecause many of these loans had been\npackaged together in highly complex\nways, banks suddenly realised that they\ncouldn\u2019t really tell which loans were safe\nand which weren\u2019t. They also couldn\u2019t\ntrust the safety of other banks and so\nstopped lending to each other, resulting\nin the credit crunch. Stiglitz\u2019s verdict is\nclear - commercial banks shouldn\u2019t be allowed to create products they don\u2019t fully\nunderstand. As US Treasury Secretary\nHenry Paulson quipped, \u201cthe only useful financial innovation in recent decades\nhas been the cash machine\u201d.\nPerformance related pay was abandoned by most professions when it\nbecame clear that it rewarded quantity,\nnot quality and encouraged short term\nresults. These are precisely the problems plaguing modern banking. Bonuses are paid for gains but pay is not\ndocked for losses, promoting excessive\nrisk taking as bankers just couldn\u2019t\nlose. Mortgage vendors were rewarded\naccording to the number of mortgages\nissued, not their quality, leading to the\nphenomenon of \u201cliar loans\u201d for which\nborrowers required no proof of income.\nEven after the Crunch, the flow of bonuses continued, making a mockery of\nthe claim that they were performance\nbased.\nThe economics of occupation\nRory Fenton and Kadhim Shubber on the latest protest in London\nJulian Assange addressing eager protestors at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Where\u2019s Julian?\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBut perhaps the strongest externality\nwas the implicit guarantee that the government would always save the biggest\nbanks to protect the rest of the economy.\nThis safety net enabled banks to take\nmuch greater risk at much lower interest\nrates - a subsidy of billions of dollars,\ngreatly distorting the market. When the\nbailouts were received, very little was\nloaned on to small and medium sized\nbusiness, the risks of speculation were\nstill too tempting.\nUnlike some of London\u2019s protesters,\nStiglitz is no communist and recognises the importance of markets - the\nkey is regulation. As the world sits on\nthe brink of what may well be a double\ndip recession, here are his suggestions\nfor policy changes to make a difference:\n1. Separate commercial banks from\ninvestment banks - banks shouldn\u2019t be\ntaking huge risks with ordinary households\u2019 money.\n2. Require banks to keep some of\nthe mortgages they sell on their books\nto ensure they have a vested interest on\nproviding loans to those how can afford\nthem.\n3. Give share holders greater say\nover executive pay and stop payments\nin stock options - they encourage short-term thinking.\n4. Require bailout funds to go to\nsmall and medium sized business. Much\nof it is their money, after all.\nThis is Stiglitz\u2019s manifesto for\nchange. As protesters endure the biting\nwinds outside St Paul\u2019s, they could do\nworse than adopt it too. Free markets\nhave failed but markets can still work\nwithin sensible rules. But this isn\u2019t the\nwhole story. The protestors are also\ncampaigning against the erosion of our\ndemocracy, in which government rules\nin the corporate interest rather than the\npublic interest (the trickle-down myth\nused to pretend that the two are one and\nthe same), and they are also protesting\nthe enormous inequality in our society.\n2008 should have been our wakeup\ncall. Instead policy-makers decided that\nit was just part of the normal capitalistic\nboom and bust. It\u2019s clear that there has\nbeen a much deeper shift. We need to\nre-evaluate how we run our society, and\nto whose advantage the current system\nis geared. Failure to change in 2008\nbrought around the current difficulties.\nThe world cannot afford to make the\nsame mistake twice.\nMarket Failure\nRisky business\nBankers on benefits\nWhat\u2019s to be done?\nPerformance related pay\nand other oxymorons\nKadhim Shubber\n\u201cBanks and global\nfinancial institutions\nare powerless to\nsolve this crisis\u201d\n\n"

However, we would\nlike to say a very special thanks to the Jewish\nSociety Interfaith Representative.\nOn Tuesday 18 October, Interfaith and the IC\nJewish Society set up a Succah on campus, for\nthe first time ever in the university\u2019s history. It\nwas undoubtedly a great success.\nThe week-long Jewish festival of Succot,\n(singular: \u201cSuccah\u201d), is named after the symbolic wilderness shelters or temporary huts\ndwelt in by the Israelites whilst in the wilderness of the Sinai Desert, after they were freed\nfrom slavery in Egypt and before entering the\nPromised Land, forty years later.\nThese temporary shelters are dwelt in again,\nevery year, from the 15th to the 21st day of the\nJewish year. The commandment \u201cto dwell\u201d in\nthe succah is fulfilled by spending as much\ntime as possible inside, including eating one\u2019s\nmeals, as well as sleeping in the succah, if possible and weather and health permitting.\nThe Succah must have at least three walls and\na rooftop made of thatch or branches that provide shade, but also allow you to see the stars. It\nis traditionally decorated with autumnal fruits\nas a reference to the end of the harvesting season and with Judaic themes, as well as the four\nkey species - a palm branch, three branches of\nmyrtle, two willow branches (the lulav) and\na citron (the etrog). Although each represents\na different type of person, all four species are\ntaken and bound together to symbolize that the\nmitzvah, or \u201cgood deed\u201d, of Sukkot unites us\nall.\nThough on the one hand, dwelling in the simplicity of the Succah reminds us of the frailty\nand transience of life, it reminds us of God\u2019 s\nEstamos de volta!\nWho hasn\u2019t heard of the amazing Portuguese\ncuisine? Of the famous Brazilian carnival? Of the\nfast-growing Angolan economy? Yes, between\nfootballers, hot weather and welcoming, fun\npeople, Portuguese speaking countries have had\ntheir fair share in leaving cultural marks\naround the world \u2013 and now, we\u2019re\nready to do the same at Imperial.\nStarting small but enthusiastic,\nwe\u2019re not only looking out for\nthose who see this society as a\nreminder of home, but for anyone\nwishing to learn more about our\ncultures and love for mingling.\nWith an events calendar already\nestablished for this term, don\u2019t be fooled\nby quantity, because we are best at making\nup for it in quality time spent between friends!\nThe first event of the year has already been a\nsuccess! Teaming up with the King\u2019s College\nPortuguese & Brazilian society, members of\nthe IC Portuguese Speaking Society went on a\npubcrawl between Vauxhall and Stockwell. The\npubcrawl was a great success, highlighted by the\nbreak in social drinking to watch the PortugalIceland match, an important qualification for the\n2012 UEFA cup. Rest assured, Portugal won by\na stunning 5-3, and at the time of writing currently sits atop the Group H qualifications,\nalthough tied point-wise with Denmark. But enough of the football.\nAnyone is welcome to join our\nfirst dinner in Stockwell on October 28, where a growing Portuguese community brings to us\ndishes that will make anyone fall\nin love and ask for more. Meeting\npoint will be Vauxhall tube station at\n20:00, where we will then head over to\nO Campino, where we\u2019ll enjoy a menu that includes starters, a main course, a drink and coffee\nfor \u00a38.\nIf you prefer a proper night out, we propose\nInes Vaz\nPortSoc arrive at Imperial College\nInterfaith make history after celebrating Jewish festival on campus\nAndrea Levy\nSayinthen Vivekanantham\nInterfaith Committee 2011-2012, left to right: Cornelius Ng (Cath Soc Rep), Mustafa\nKhan (AB Soc Rep), Sayinthen Vivekanantham (President), Sukhraj Takhar (Sikh Soc\nRep), Dodie Levene (Jewish Soc Rep)\n\n"

It was\nwhilst studying here that Angela first came\nacross the concept and she admits that she was\nsurprised to find nothing comparable on her arrival to London. \u201cWhen I came to Imperial and\nI looked to join societies I assumed there must\nbe something like Fusion because it\u2019s London.\nI looked around and there was nothing. A lot\nof societies have their own smaller events but\nnothing really infuses loads of other societies\nand especially nothing integrates other universities\u201d\nAnd so with a spark in her eye, a little determination and a desire to give something back\nto the charity that sponsors her own doctoral\nstudies, Angela conceived Fusion@London.\nWhilst related to its Northern cousin, Angela\npromises something leaner, meaner and more\nmetropolitan. \u201cLondon Fusion fuses three different universities, that\u2019s the one major differ-ence, whereas York was just York. London\u2019s a\nlot bigger. We\u2019re looking to book headline acts,\ncelebrity artists and comperes.\u201d\nCoinciding with London Fashion Week 2012,\nFusion intends to serve a little slice of the catwalk in its own unique serving style, \u201cIn York\nthey showcase mostly High Street fashion\nstores, like Hugo Boss, Mango, River Island,\nplaces like that. We\u2019re still focused on showcasing student talent; most of our designers\ncome from London College of Fashion, Central\nSaint Martin\u2019s so in that sense we\u2019ve also involved those two universities.\u201d\nThe grand scale of Fusion gives the performers the opportunity to work with world-class\nartists and designers, something that filters\ndown to create a world-class show for the rest\nof us. \u201cThe unique structure of Fusion gives a\nmore enriching experience than university societies could provide on their own, stretching beyond the boundaries of their own institution,\u201d\nFusion committee member and UCL student\nCharlotte told Felix. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to\nexpand your horizons.\u201d\nWith hip hop, belly, ballet, contemporary, lyrical dance, burlesque and much more, Fusion\nhopes to choreograph a spectacle that leads the\naudience with it, keeping them in its thrall at\nevery turn. Angela hopes that Fusion can have\na unity and continuity that has been lacking in\nsimilar events, where individual clubs and societies tended to contribute scenes in a piece-meal, disjointed manner.\nFelix paid a visit to the auditions earlier this\nweek, to test the air amongst the potential con-tributors. The atmosphere was dense with tingling excitement (possibly heightened by the\nstress of auditioning) and a buoyant optimism\nhung in the air that this was something only\npossible in London.\nWe spoke to Azel, a student who\u2019d recently\njoined UCL from Leicester, who told us that\nshe doubted a similar project could take place\nanywhere else. \u201cIt definitely wouldn\u2019t have\nhappened in other cities. In smaller towns\nuniversities are more insular and there\u2019s less\nconflict in London between unis.\u201d\nAll this however does come with risks. Historically intercollegiate events have tended to\nmiss the bar; one needn\u2019t think too far back\nto recall the phenomenal success of the ICLKCL-Goldsmith\u2019s joint Summer Ball last year\nand the black hole it created in Union financ-es. But the human investment that has gone\ninto Fusion suggests this could be amongst\nthe first to buck the trend. Never before have\nstudents been invited to collectively create the\nevent rather than pay their entry fee and prop\nup the bar.\nFusion launches later this month with\ntheir Halloween Masquerade Ball at the\nCaf\u00e9 de Paris, Piccadilly, on the October\n31. \u00a39 tickets (\u00a312 for non-students).\nGo to fusionatlondon.com for more de-tails.\nThe farmer wants his chickens back\nFollowing huge success at the University of York, the\nfashion and dance project hits the London Universities\nWill Prince\nIn the face of stricter drinking rules, the Medics had to think of alternative intiations\n\n"

That\u2019s why it\u2019s completely OK to\nfeel sick of them. There is, however, a place in\nLondon where you can have your coffee or tea\nlike you\u2019ve never have before. It\u2019s small, it\u2019s\ncozy, it\u2019s friendly, it\u2019s \u201cBetty Blythe\u201d. Named\nafter the Hollywood starlet, \u201cBetty Blythe\u201d is a\nbeautiful, vintage teashop and fine food pantry\nin west London \u2013 just 10 minutes walking from\nHammersmith Station.\nBetty Blythe offers a complete selection of coffees and teas, as well as a wide range of fresh\npastries, muffins and cakes. The highlight of a\nvisitor\u2019s experience in my opinion is the maca-roons. They look fresh and they taste fresh; having just the right size they match incredibly with\na morning or afternoon tea without being too\nsweet. The counter is full with beautifully made\ncakes and colourful treats and the staff look very\nkeen to help you choose!\nBetty Blythe is also a wonderful spot for an elegant hen-do or a birthday party offering pretty\ndecor and delicious food. You can choose be-Food Bites\nMichael Krestas\nVintage and glamorous Betty\nCluster Bombs\nI have recently tried the new Kellogg\u2019s Special K\nHoney Clusters and although I did not have many\nexpectations (I usually expect low fat cereals to\nbe plain and boring), they have become my first\nchoice for breakfast. This is because they are\ncrunchy, sweet, and healthy. For sure, they are\nmuch better than any other variations of Kellogg\u2019s\nSpecial K, but the downside is that they are expensive when not on offer. George Trigeorgis\nFood Editors: Anastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\n\u201cI want to keep fighting because it is the only\nthing that keeps me out of the hamburger\njoints. If I don\u2019t fight, I\u2019ll eat this planet.\u201d Take\nthis George Foreman quote, replace \u2018fight\u2019\nwith \u2018study\u2019 and \u2018hamburger joints\u2019 with \u2018Byron\u2019 and it\u2019s instantly applicable to me. Well,\nsort of. OK, not really, but I still really like\nByron.\nFor the unenlightened, Byron is a hamburger\nrestaurant chain that was set up in 2007, with\nseventeen restaurants currently scattered about\ncentral and greater London, two of which are\nalmost on Imperial\u2019s doorstep (one opposite\nGloucester Road station, the other a few minutes walk from South Kensington station).\nThey all sport a clean, minimalistic look, but\nat the same time none of their restaurants have\nnever felt cold, simply because they\u2019re always\nbustling with life. Or maybe I\u2019ve always been\nfar too focused on the delicious food to ever\ntake notice.\nByron\u2019s menu isn\u2019t exhaustive by any means,\nbut by GOD do they focus their attention well.\nIf you\u2019ve never been a fan of hamburgers\nsimply because no place seems to get them\nright, try here. No soggy salad, no overload\nof cheese, buns that actually complement the\nmeal rather than exist as a source of carbohy-drates...\nAm I getting the message across that I really\nrather like this place? The classic cheese is the\ncrowning jewel; six ounces of freshly ground\nbeef (cooked, obviously) with a slice of cheddar (or the cheese of your choice) and just the\nright amount of veggies to keep me sufficient-Byron means Burger\nLaurence Pope ly hooked and drooling all over my keyboard.\nOutside of the Heaven-sent hamburgers are\na modest number of main and side salads,\nwhich, whilst crunchy and better than most,\npale in comparison to their meatier main\ncourse brethren. The choice for vegetarians is\nsomewhat limited however \u2013 there\u2019s a veggie\nburger (made with grilled Portobello mush-room), and one of the salads is meat-free (the\nbuffalo mozzarella and lentil), but beyond that\nyou\u2019re rather limited in choice.\nIf you like either of those then you\u2019re in for\na treat, but slightly pickier vegetarians may\nvery well want to give Byron a miss. Obligate\ncarnivores on the other hand will not be disap-pointed.\nThe dessert menu is small as well, but does\ncontain some very nice after-dinner treats to\nindulge yourself with. Unfortunately light sorbets or fruit salads are missing from the menu;\noften after a large meal the last thing you want\nto eat is a rich chocolate brownie or cream-laden banana split.\nSomething small and sweet to end the meal\nwith would round it off nicely, possibly accompanied by a glass of wine \u2013 of which there\nis a respectable selection.\nI could try and go on about meat texture,\nsubtle flavours and whatnot, but at the end of\nthe day I\u2019m no food buff. Let me put it simply \u2013 I know what I like, and I like Byron. So\nwill you.\ntween the main caf\u00e9 and the downstairs tearoom\n\u2013 for a more private space.\nBetty Blythe is the absolute vintage and glamorous get-together place for you girls to meet,\nchit-chat, have your party and gossip (now I\u2019m\nbeing rude!). For you guys I have one thing to\nsay: the food there is too good to get stopped by\nthe girlie tone of the caf\u00e9.

If so, something\u2019s going wrong.\nI realised my demise when, strolling\ndown the fashionable Boulevard de la\nCroisette in Cannes, rather than checking out some bronzed Adonis sunning\nhimself on his yacht, I found myself\neyeing up the arm-candy the most stylish women of Cannes were toting. The\nthought of the fabulously assured way\none woman carried herself would never\nleave me until I might be able to buy\nthat kind of fabulosity in the form of\nher gorgeous vintage Louis Vuitton Epi\nSaint Jacques. And the fashion merry-go-round turns around again. And it\nwill carry on turning for all you fashion\nfreaks like me, unless we set ourselves\na drastic (but affordable) quota, for we\nmust not let our plastic/leather/pleather\n\u2018frenemies\u2019 eat away at what remains of\nour fashion-infested souls.\nMaybe remind me again of this resolution the next time Phoebe Philo creates another drool-worthy C\u00e8line tote.\nAt least my soul will have somewhere\npretty to live\u2026\nerence to the latest overdraft-busting\nPrada Saffiano tote still yields the inevitable questions from parents, boyfriends\nand most unfortunately, jealous friends.\nDo they not serve an equal purpose?\nNo, alas, the answer delves much deeper than the mere fabric from which our\nbags are made.\nThe bags we carry are a sign of status,\nand a great bag is a marker of fashion\nkudos and respect. \u201cRespect for what?\u201d\nI hear all you doubters cry. And here\u2019s\nthe ugly truth, ladies: respect for your-self. Was J.K. Rowling right about Horcruxes, the vessels Voldemort chose as\nmeaningful objects in his life in which\nto keep fragments of his soul? Is the designer handbag a modern-day woman\u2019s\nequivalent to a Horcrux \u2013 a lifeless object which we (unknowingly) perfuse\nwith the very essence of ourselves?\nAnd, having chosen as our vessel a bag\nwhose assault on our Visa/Mastercard\nbill is somewhere on par with a Cruciatus curse, have we not sold a fragment\nof our soul to the fashion industry?\nDeprived of the logo-embossed leather\nI\nrather like shoes, which is a\nproblem because buying shoes\nis usually the low point of any\nshopping trip, especially for\nmen. I guess we buy fewer shoes\nand don\u2019t spend as much money on\nthem, and thus as inferior customers\nget massively inferior treatment in shoe\nshops.\nYour average \u2018Office\u2019 will stash the\nmen away into one corner to be buffeted left and right while we look at our\nmeagre, drab footwear selection by staff\nmembers carrying myriad boxes back\nto the exquisitely more profitable and\nfairer sex. Worse still are shoe shops\nthat coldly point gentlemen up a flight\nof hidden stairs to, what is at first sight\nan abandoned attic. The music \u2013 which\nprovides a youthful, fresh and lively\nparty atmosphere to the ladies section\ndownstairs \u2013 imbues the men\u2019s section\nwith the ambience of a nightclub too\nearly in the evening: the punters, semi-embarrassed at turning up to such a deserted establishment, awkwardly stake\nout their spot and trying not to make\neye-contact.\nSo far thus had been my shoe shopping experience two weekends back, I\nAMan\u2019s Shoe Haven\nI went in, it was full of people and the\nmusic was up, but somehow I wasn\u2019t\nbeaten back by the sensation of anarchic\nviolence that had been present in every\nother busy shoe shop I\u2019d been in that\nday. A staff member said \u201cHello,\u201d with\na merciful absence of that \u201cCan I help\nyou?\u201d bullshit. I found a pair of trainers that I quite liked. They brought me\na pair that fit. I liked them. They gave\nme a 10% student discount (non-NUS,\nmassively, massively lacking from other retailers ) and\u2026 brace yourselves\u2026\na canvas bag to take them home in.\nLike seriously you know how Office and Topman give you those paper\nbags that fall apart and kill your hands\nand generally make your life hell by\nthe time you\u2019ve gotten two tube trains\nhome on a Saturday early evening.\nNot so with these guys, despite being\nwas out looking for a pair of weather\nproof hi-top trainers for day to day\ncasual wear in the lab and out to the\npub and gigs. Budget: up to \u00a380. Not a\ntough ask by any stretch of the imagi-nation, but after several big-chain shoe\nstores I was so un-inspired that I was\nbeginning to wonder if I even needed to\nreplace my hole riddled, rapidly decaying Reeboks.\nThis was a sorry state of affairs, my\nlast shoe shopping attempt had been\nwith my girlfriend and I\u2019d wound up in\nsuch a terrible mood we nearly broke up\n(happily to say we\u2019re still together and,\nafter a veritably geological time period,\nthe woman in Schuh eventually brought\nout the correct size pair of vans that I\nnow own); if I had another awful shoe\nshopping trip I may have had to give up\nentirely on shoes and fashion footwear\nout of rags.\nLuckily I found Offspring on 60 Neal\nStreet (although if it\u2019s more convenient\nfor you, they have one on Camden high\nstreet). I had never heard of it before\nbut the window looked promising. In\nfront of my weary eyes was shop full\nof nothing but beautiful trainers of all\nvarieties.\nFederica Amato and Saskia Verhagen discuss the curse of the designer handbag\nMatthew Allinson tackles the hell of the High Street and finds heaven at Offspring\ncheaper than competitors they gave me\na proper bag I can use again.\nI know the quality of the bag is a\nweird point to get all excited about but\nI mean, trainers are all pretty much the\nsame wherever you buy them from but\nI have so much time for seriously good\ncustomer service at no extra cost, and\nthe proper bag is a tangible example of\nhow these guys provided it.\nOffspring made me realise I don\u2019t hate\nshoe shopping \u2013 I just hate most shoe\nshops. All I ever wanted was a wide selection of trainers to choose from and\nto be treated like a human being while I\nmade my choice. If, like me, you share\nthese modest demands, I highly recommend you try these guys out.\n\u201cThey brought me a\npair that fit. I liked\nthem\u201d\nHandbags \u2013 probably the best place to keep your sleeping pills\nWho needs shoes? I use reinforced bin bags \u2013 deal with it\n\n"

MI6 chief \u2018Control\u2019 (John Hurt)\nmanaged to narrow the search for the\ninfiltrator down to a shortlist of suspects\nbefore his own untimely sacking: Percy\nAlleline (Toby Jones), who takes over\nthe top job after the dismissal of Control; Bill Haydon (Colin Firth), a player\nwho slept with Smiley\u2019s wife; Director of Operations Roy Bland (Ciar\u00e0n\nHinds); and skillful double-bluffer\nToby Estherhase (David Dencik). One\nis guilty of passing secrets to the Russians \u2013 Smiley must root out the spy to\nsave the reputation of the Service before too many vital secrets are leaked.\nHe is assisted in his search for the mole\nby junior MI6 official Peter Guillam\n(Benedict Cumberbatch), former Head\nof Personnel Connie Sachs (Kathy\nBurke), and Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy),\na fellow agent with his own agenda.\nThe plot twists slyly as we follow Smiley\u2019s investigation, and catch fleeting\nglimpses of the shadowy past through\nhis flashbacks.\nDirector Tomas Alfredson (best\nknown internationally for directing the\n2008 vampire film Let The Right One\nIn) carefully extracts his adaptation\nfrom the intricately detailed original\nnovel to produce a bleak, beige, suf-focatingly male-dominated world into\nwhich the viewer is drawn \u2013 a far cry\nfrom the usual glamour of our James\nBond-esque spies. The superficial,\nback-stabbing nature of office politics\nis captured effectively which, along\nwith the conversations being filmed as\nthough the viewer is eavesdropping,\nadds to the uncomfortable air of secrecy\nand lies felt throughout the film. Hats\noff to Casting Director Jina Jay \u2013 the\noutstanding cast were chosen perfectly,\nand the list alone gives some idea as to\nthe quality of the acting. Oldman portrays the taciturn Smiley brilliantly,\nbringing danger and anger to the character that wasn\u2019t seen in the original\nadaptation when Alec Guinness played\nthe role. He is backed up, of course, by\na fantastic supporting cast including\nsome of the best of British actors, who\nall seem to be at the peak of their game.\nThe only flaw in this film is that the\nwhistle is blown too soon. For a few\nquick-witted, spy-minded types, the\nguilty party can be sussed out well before Smiley catches up; however this\ndoesn\u2019t really seem to matter \u2013 this\nfilm is more about the journey than the\ndestination. The story is teeming with\ntension, secrecy and twists, but while\nthere\u2019s not a lot of laughing to be done,\nand its pace and tricky plot will not be\nfor everyone, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\nstill comes highly recommended.\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTop 15 UK Box\nOffice\n1) Johnny English\nReborn (PG \u2013 Rowan\nAtkinson, Rosamund\nPike, Dominic West\n2) The Lion King 3D (U\n\u2013 Jeremy Irons, Matthew\nBroderick)\n3) The Three Musketeers (12A \u2013 Matthew\nMacfadyen, Milla Jovovich, Luke Evans)\n4) Real Steel (12A \u2013\nHugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly)\n5) Tinker Tailor Soldier\nSpy (15 \u2013 Gary Oldman,\nJohn Hurt, Colin Firth)\n6) Footloose (12A \u2013\nKerry Wormald, Julianne\nHough)\n7) Dolphin Tale (U \u2013\nHarry Connick Jr.,Ashley\nJudd)\n8) Midnight in Paris\n(12A - Owen Wilson,\nRachel McAdams)\n9) Don\u2019t Be Afraid of\nthe Dark (15 \u2013 Bailee\nMadison, Katie Holmes)\n10) Drive (18 \u2013 Ryan\nGosling, Carey Mulligan)\n11) Crazy, Stupid, Love\n(12A \u2013 Steve Carell, Julianne Moore)\n12) Abduction (12A\n\u2013 Taylor Lautner, Lily\nCollins)\n13) The Inbetweeners Movie (15 \u2013 James\nBuckley, Blake Harrison)\n14) The Debt (15 \u2013\nSam Worthington, Helen\nMirren)\n15) The Smurfs (U \u2013\nHank Azaria, Neil Patrick\nHarris)\nWhere the hell\u2019s Johnny English when you need him?\nLove a good sci-fi (who doesn\u2019t)?

Whilst constantly mocked\nby his fianc\u00e9e (McAdams), he finds\ntrue happiness by wandering around the\nFrench city. He stumbles on a mysterious car one night, with its passengers\nurging Gil to come and join them. Deciding to go along for the ride, he finds\nhimself socialising with the literary\nlegends of the 1920s Lost Generation\n(Hemingway, Stein) who he has admired throughout his entire life.\nThe illusion the past creates, how we\nare never wholly satisfied with where\nwe are at the moment, and our constant\ndesire for a better life, are the challenges Gil faces when he sees something so\nglamorous. But Allen is here to assure\nus that it\u2019s not really all that bad; if we\nstick with it and have patience.\nAllen has his ups and downs, but this\nis one of his more moving pieces of\nwork in recent years.

Without\nturning this review into a convoluted love letter to her,\nthere is a girl you\u2019d want to hang out with more than\none who tweets: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t my bbm working I\u2019m trying\nto send a picture of my dick (shaped bruise) to my\nfriend Stacey this is an OUTRAGE\u201d\nSlow Club\u2019s second album, Paradise, is less a\n\u2018middle finger\u2019 and more a \u2018slightly cheeky two-fin-gered salute\u2019 to their aforementioned twee image.\nBandmate Charles Watson has been relegated to\nguitar and backing vocals, and while they still write\nupbeat indie-folk love songs, there\u2019s more texture,\ncomplexity, and humanity. If their first album is a\nsweet stickman drawing, their second is more like\nthe dense palette that adorns its album cover.\nUnderpinning all of this is Rebecca Taylor. The same\ngirl who tweets, \u201c100 PINTS OF WINE PLEASE BAR\nKEEP\u201d, also writes beautiful phrases like \u201cA chauffeur-driven dream\u201d and sings them with the sensitivity of\na neutrino detector (Zing!) . Which makes her pretty\nawesome in my books. Oh dear, I\u2019ve turned this review\ninto a convoluted love letter after all.\nIf you get bored this weekend, drink 100 pints of wine\nand tweet me from the hospital @kadhimshubber.\nBetter still, photoshop a picture of Ryan Gosling sitting\non Taylor\u2019s face and tweet her @SLOWCLUBREBECCA.\nMusic Editors: I\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nStephen Smith\nT\nally Hall is a slightly quirky five-piece band, named after a shopping\narcade in Michigan, with the final\nline-up was completed while they\nwere studying at the University\nof Michigan. It consists of Rob Cantor (guitar,\nyellow tie), Joe Hawley (guitar, red tie), Zubin\nSedghi (bass, blue tie),Andrew Horowitz (keys,\ngreen tie) and Ross Federman (drums, grey tie)\nwith them swapping around vocal duties, and\noccasionally doing some excellent vocal har-monies. About the whole tie colour thing, basi-cally, when on stage, they always wear matching shirts and trousers (recently with a dapper\nwaistcoat) and a tie of the colour listed.\nTheir debut album Marvin\u2019s Marvelous Mechanical Museum, named after a museum in\nthe real life Tally Hall, was an incredibly solid\noffering \u2013 if you ask me, every song is good.\nThere really aren\u2019t any duds or, even worse, the\ndreaded \u201calbum filler tracks\u201d. You know the\nones I mean, the songs that couldn\u2019t be blander\nif they tried; usually, the name is even something dull and instantly forgettable. Thankfully,\nthere\u2019s none of that irritation on Marvin\u2019s.This is\npossibly because they are songs that have been\nhoned, perfected, recorded and re-recorded over\na number of years. It may sound obvious, but\nto me the difference between the demo versions\nand the album versions shows what an expen-sive, professional studio does to the sound.\nIn terms of genre, the songs on Marvin\u2019s are\nreally a mixed bag. The band themselves described the sound as \u201cwonky rock\u201d, due to the\noften comical, upbeat lyrical style and music.\nThey manage to write light-hearted songs that\nare both enjoyable musically and lyrically,\nwhile maintaining enough credibility for you to\ntake the heavier songs seriously. It\u2019s difficult for\nme to pick out favourites, as I love them all, so\nI\u2019ll try to choose a range of styles.\n\u2018Just Apathy\u2019, a prize-winning song (literal-ly), is brilliantly arranged: starting off as a quiet\npiano ballad and building up, before returning\nto the piano at the very end. \u2018Two Wuv\u2019, the\ncatchy song about their love for the Olsen twins,\nincludes some lovely harmonies at the end.\nStaying with the theme of more recognizable\nThey have the gall\nTim Arbabzadah welcomes you to Tally Hall...\ned songs; the enjoyment and personalities just\ndon\u2019t quite ooze out in the sound. Perhaps, because I had looked up videos of them performing the songs live before the release, the album\nfelt dated by the time I heard it. Good and Evil\nis still littered with top-notch songs, right from\nthe start in fact. \u2018Never Meant To Know\u2019 is a\ndreamy song that\u2019s also my mantra around revision time. \u2018Cannibal\u2019, \u2018Misery Fell\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019\nall deserve a mention. The later being the almost solo piano offering from Andrew, a great\ngeeky love song \u2013 something we can all relate\nto. Pushed to choose a favourite track from the\nalbum, I\u2019d say \u2018Turn the Lights Off\u2019.\nTo sum up, Tally Hall is an amazing band\nwith two great albums. If you poke about on\nYouTube you can also find some great hidden gems, including their comedy skits. \u2018Just\nA Friend\u2019, a cover of the Biz Markie song, is\na fan favourite. Joe shows off his beatboxing\nskills, while Zubin practices his soul singing\nvoice \u2013 that he later uses for \u2018To Be With You\u2019.\nCheck them out, and thank me later, as I have\nhad to miss out a lot.\n\u2018indy\u2019 style, \u2018Greener\u2019 is a song about a failing\nrelationship and envy. Okay, I know, but it\u2019s not\nas emo as that sounds; and even if it is, the lyrics\nare good enough to not be lame or cringey.\nOn the more off-the-wall side there is \u2018Welcome to Tally Hall\u2019, a song introducing the\nband. It\u2019s not just an oddity that\u2019s only good\nonce, it\u2019s a legitimately great song in it\u2019s own\nright. The part where they introduce each mem-ber, his instrument and tie colour is a classic\nverse. Then there\u2019s the line \u201cI might rap like an\nEnglish chap\u201d rapped, in an attempted upperclass English accent.\nThe band\u2019s second studio album is Good\nand Evil and was released earlier this year on\nQuack! Media. First off, it\u2019s definitely a more\nmature album. There\u2019s much less wackiness in\nthe songs, which I guess has its merits. It definitely feels like they set out to make an album\nwith an underlying theme, rather than just a collection of songs.\nIt\u2019s a great album, but there is something\nmissing that was present on Marvin\u2019s: the sense\nof fun; the mix of serious songs and light-heart-Be sure not to miss...\nColtrane nephew, Brainfeeder honcho and seasoned\nbeatsmith Flying Lotus has been conspiring with audiovisual masterminds AntiVJ for a special three-of-a-kind\nspectacular to be performed exclusively in Los Angeles,\nParis and London town.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\n14\nBusiness Editors: Nina Kearsey\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 21 OCTOBER 2011\nThere was a global economic meltdown in\n2008. World governments have since spent\ntheir time running through plans A-Z to try\nand reboot economies, but so far any recovery\nhas been wiped out by other problems such\nas the crisis in the Eurozone. The problem of\nwhat to do with the levels of debt has been\npuzzling politicians all over the world. Big\nplayers, including Ben Bernanke, Chairman\nof the Federal Reserve, and Sir Mervyn King,\nGovernor of the Bank of England, seem to\nthink Quantitative Easing (QE) is the solution.\nIn buying government bonds, the central\nbank raises the price of the assets bought and\nreduces their yield. The aim of QE is to increase the excess reserves of banks so if everything goes belly up and debt is defaulted,\nthe bank has enough cash (or liquid assets) to\ncover their back. So although the process increases the rate of inflation, the normal citizen\ndoes not get any access to the new money; it\u2019s\nused to save the same people who caused the\nmess in the first place. Prices go up but with\npay packets frozen debts are no easier to deal\nwith.\nThe problem is deciding when to stop. How\nmuch money can be printed before the situation spirals out of control? Because it\u2019s not\njust inflation QE will affect, it will also lead\nthe weakening of a nation\u2019s currency, which\nis especially problematic in an export based\neconomy (it becomes more expensive for you\nto buy goods from outside, and cheaper for\nothers to buy yours). As soon as the \u201cgood\ntimes\u201d return QE needs to be reversed and\nbanks will need to buy back the assets otherwise the problems could very quickly get out\nof control.\nThe recent party conferences produced\nsome interesting alternatives, such as that\nproposed by the current chancellor George\nOsborne. Although the now famous Plan-G\n(G for graphene) stole the headlines, a \u00a350mn\ninvestment into R&D is unlikely to save the\nRajvinder Virdee\nWhether \u2018tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\nAnd by opposing end them?\nQE, or not QE, that is the question\neconomy. More interesting was the mention\nof Credit Easing. The real difference with this\nalternate kind of Easing is that the Average Joe\nmay actually see some benefit of the process.\nInstead of a central bank, e.g. the BoE, buying\nbonds in banks, the aim is to buy corporate\nbonds. Whilst no one has quite yet decided\nwhat an English version of Credit Easing\nmight be, it would seem that banks will be\nencouraged to bundle together the loans and\noverdrafts of small companies which would\nthen be bought by the BoE. This should in\ntheory ease cash flow for small companies and\nhelp them stay liquid through the recovery.\nAnother problem with QE that has recently\nbeen uncovered is the pension \u2018black hole\u2019.\nPension fund liabilities stretch long into the\nfuture, usually linked to long-term bond\nyields. QE lowers bond yields and so this\nwould seem a problem, and it is. In fact it\u2019s\na big problem. When the BoE\u2019s first round of\nQE was finished, resulting in \u00a3200bn worth of\nbonds bought, it was estimated that the pen-Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Sir Mervyn King, Govenor of the\nBank of England, ponder possible solutions to the worsening financial situation.\nSPECIAL REPORT: Quantitative Easing\nTwo of our top contributors summarise the situation and pass comment. Rajvinder Virdee\nintroduces us to the policy in the context of the worsening global financial situation and explains its effects on the man-on-the-street. Then, in the second part of our special, Shiang-Jin\nChin delves into the reasoning behind this measure, and discusses some of the broader implications in terms of British economic policy.\nYour new BUSINESS editors bring you a special report into Quantitative Easing\nLetter from the Editors\nThe news in finance and the economy does not\nendear itself to an \u2018everyman\u2019 readership. Obtuse\nlanguage, subtle argument and the inescapable\nrequirement to resort to mathematics and statistics define a small subset of Business readers from the many that filter through the headline\npages of our broadsheets and other newspapers.\nBut whether understood or not, the financial situation of the UK, the Eurozone and overseas (albeit\nmostly in a westerly direction), has begun to impact on readers of Arts and Business alike. Inflation and interest rates are tangible, and now, more\nthan being felt, they will hurt: inflation in the UK\nrose above 5% this September, spurred mainly by\nincreasing energy prices, while interest is flatlining\nat a tenth of that, and rumours it could be cut to\nas little as 0.25%.\nWith the pragmatism of scientists we may look\nto solve these economic woes. More than their solution however, it is the mechanism by which these\nissues are tackled that we should consider. We\nhave to create the conditions in which a solution\ncan be achieved: namely, by fostering debate. And\nas debate begins with information, we are here to\ninform. Read our section, tell us what you like and\nwhat you don\u2019t; tell us what you agree with, disagree with, and why. We\u2019ve an advantage in knowing our readers to be smart and mathematically\nadept. We know you can understand; all we really\nneed is your interest.\n\u2013 The Business Editors\nsion deficit of FTSE 350 companies increased\nby \u00a370bn. Now the BoE has committed to yet\nmore QE, it has estimated another increase of\n\u00a325bn in the deficit will occur. And these are\nconservative estimates. To cover the deficit,\nemployers will have to use more of their own\nmoney to pay off pensions resulting in lower\ncapital expenditure being pumped into the\neconomy. These new facts seem to make QE\nseem less and less attractive.\nIt\u2019s hard to say if QE is working or not with\nso many problems going on at the same time\nin world economies. In light of the pensions\nissue it seems we are seeing the bad effects of\n\u00a3200 billion, but the benefits of just \u00a3130bn.\nMost of the central banks love the idea of QE,\nbut it\u2019s not completely apparent why. Instead\nperhaps George Osborne should be praised\nfor having the guts to say he is going to try\nsomething else. Credit Easing seems fairer,\nand will inject money into the economy where\nit is hurting the most: on the High Streets, in\nshopping centres, and in people\u2019s pockets, not\njust the bonus packets of bankers as QE does.\nSo, to QE or not QE? It would seem that perhaps QE should not be the way forward. It\u2019s\nbeen tried for three years, and although it may\nhave helped prevent a double-dip recession, it\nis no way to promote economic growth. If the\nquestion were reduced down to picking teams\nas in the school playground - sorry Ben, but\nlet\u2019s go with George.\n\n"

It is the perfect moment to visit, the\nrooms being relatively empty and peaceful.\nThis is very conducive to a careful, and thus\nmore interesting viewing of the National Gallery\u2019s splendid collection. However there are\nfew students, excepting those who focus solely\non Art of course, who know how to look at a\npainting in order to get the most out of it. We\nunderstand little about the myths and fables\nthat are the subject of many paintings, less\nabout technique, and even less about symbol-ism. Without basic knowledge, going to a gallery can become a torturous journey into a land\nof boredom.\nLuckily, Art Shots is here to help. On the second Friday of every month, Rose Balston leads\na group of approximately fifteen people around\none section of the National Gallery\u2019s collec-tion. Having lived and studied in Italy for four\nyears, Rose wanted to share her knowledge of\nItalian art with the general public. The National\nGallery, with its enviable collection, was the\nperfect place to start. She runs many art tours,\ncatering to different levels of interest and ex-pertise. Art Shots in particular is a tour aimed\nexclusively at young students and professionals\nwho perhaps do not have the time to visit museums on a regular basis, but still want a deeper\nunderstanding of art.\nRose concentrates on four or five works\nfrom a particular period, allotting time to each,\nwhich, on our own we probably would not. Approximately twenty minutes were dedicated\nto each painting on the tour of the Florentine\nRenaissance that took place last Friday. The\ntour itself commenced with a short history of\nFlorence, as it stood just before, as well as during the Renaissance. Not only did this place the\nworks of art into historical context, it was also\nrife with compelling, little known details. Then,\nthe tour commenced in earnest, with the group\nhuddled around a painting about which Rose\ngave an enthralling lecture. At first, everyone\nwas shy about answering the questions posed\nbut by the second painting, Rose had succeeded\nin drawing answers from us all.\nThe symbolism in each work of art was\nheavily drawn upon, and in most cases, the\nindividual was compelled to find an answer\nbefore Rose finally explained in detail. This\nwas remarkably useful, because it taught us to\nfind the symbols on our own, a skill which can\nthen be practiced on any normal visit to a mu-seum. Symbolism is intricately related to the\nmyths and legends upon which most paintings\nfrom the Renaissance are based on. The group\nthus became acquainted with Ancient Roman,\nGreek and religious stories, some of which are\ncommonly known, but many of which we only\nhave a vague idea about. There was also discussion on the innovative techniques, which\nstarted and developed during the Renaissance.\nIt was fascinating to find out for example, that\nmost painters of that period were also amateur\nmathematicians, who used mathematics to\nachieve perfection of form and composition.\nArt Shots is not just a cultural activity. There\nis an important social component to the eve-ning. Drinks beforehand are at six, in the National Gallery caf\u00e9, where one can chat to Rose\nand her collaborators. Then, the tour of the\ngalleries is followed by dinner in either a Soho\npub, or one of two private members clubs. Discussions that began during the tour are continued throughout the meal. As the whole affair\nbegins quite early, it is perfectly possible to\ncontinue on to bars and clubs afterwards and\nnot miss a Friday night if one is worried by that\nprospect. Furthermore, the price of dinner is\nnot included in the tour price, so one can leave\ndirectly after the tour, at a very reasonable hour,\nboasting about their newly acquired, slightly\nobscure, knowledge.\nAlthough the price of the tours is possibly a\nbit steep, at \u00a320 for an hour and fifteen minutes,\nthey are well worth it. In order to learn quite\nsimply, how to look at art, it is only necessary\nto attend once. If I returned to the National Gallery today, to the Florentine Renaissance section in particular, I would without a doubt find\nmyself understanding far more than before last\nFriday.\nAlex Horne is something of a mystery to me. He\u2019s\nlittle known except by regular explorers of the\ncomedy circuit and yet seems to have the phone-book of an A-list celebrity comedian. Here\u2019s\na man whose shows pull in the likes of Tim\nMinchin, Harry Hill and Jimmy Carr to name but\na few, and yet who himself is rarely seen on TV\nor heard on radio. But if there were any question\nmarks hanging over his comic credentials, his\nSection does more than answer them.\nThe Horne Section is a musical mash-up cabaret extraordinaire, where maestro Alex Horne\ninvites comedians and other entertainers alike to\nwork their art with the able, and optional, assistance of his several-piece band. Never flustered\nby the spontaneous suggestions of the audience,\nthey flex their embrasures and plectrum-fingers\nin the opening moments, asking for a rhythm,\nkey and two well known tunes, before seamlessly\nmelding it all together in a flurry of musical tal-ent.\nWith a loose structure around proceedings,\nthe Horne Section guarantees to throw up something unique, in the main due to its invitational\nbill. Fresh from a stint on the Edinburgh Fringe,\nwhere the show was one of the most lauded, the\nCriterion Theatre is a slightly more restrictive\nsetting than that of the Spiegeltent, which had\nthe much more relaxed and comfortable feel of\na comedy-club-cum-garden-party. The product is\nnevertheless of the same high quality, most of the\nacts are worth seeing on their own merits - Tim\nMinchin, Josie Long and Beardyman are all appearing in tomorrow\u2019s show alone.\nStarting late in central London, the Horne Section puts a nice icing on the cake of a Saturday\nnight, allowing punters to grease their own funny\nbones before they get tickled at the Criterion,\nand how. Little compares to the Horne Section\nand anything that does falls a long way short\nof this paradoxically polished yet spontaneous\nproduction.\nThe Horne Section runs every Saturday\nat the Criterion on Piccadilly until November 26\nShots of Art\nWant to get your Horne on?\nEva Rosenthal\nThe National Gallery in a way you\u2019ve never seen before\nWhat do you think Venus and Mars have just finished?

I am happy to say that I was hooked as\nsoon as I tuned in.\nThe fly-on-the-wall nature of the programme\nmeans that you really get a feel for what the\nschool is like. The show stays impartial at all\ntimes: you see both the good and the bad and you\naren\u2019t distracted by hasty conclusions or incessant\nmoralising by the producers. There is a real sense\nthat we are seeing what Passmores is really like.\nEach episode focuses on only one or two groups\nof pupils which allows their stories to be examined in full. Difficult issues aren\u2019t shied away\nfrom \u2014 with, amongst other problems, teenage\npregnancy and bullying being explored. Even the\nmost troublesome and disruptive pupils aren\u2019t\ndemonised. Care is taken to show both sides of\nthe story and commentary from both pupils and\nstaff shows how the current situation developed.\nParticularly poignant is the case of Vinnie, whose\nPick of the week\nFriday | 1945 - 2030 | BBC3\nMerlin\nMagical drama.

Philip Glenister is a MASSIVE LAD.\nJ\neff Lindsay\u2019s book \u2018Darkly\nDreaming Dexter\u2019 (which I\u2019m\ntold is very good) is the basis\nfor Showtime\u2019s multi award\nwinning program Dexter. The\nprotagonist, who gives the show its\nname, is cunning, brutal and funny.\nBy day he\u2019s a blood spatter analyst for\nMiami Metro Police Department. By\nnight, a serial killer. What sets Dexter\napart from other protagonists is that he\u2019s\na normal human - he makes mistakes:\nhe\u2019s no Jack Bauer or Michael Schofield\n(24 and Prison Break, respectively).\nWe are first introduced to our lead\nas he gives a sinister sounding monologue backed by equally chilling music\n(written by Daniel Licht) whilst driving through the night towards his first\nvictim. The viewers are immediately\ninformed that Dexter is a killer first and\nforemost; demonstrated only a few minutes later where we see him beginning\nto clinically cut up his prey.\nAs the first season develops we learn\nmore about Dexter and the writers begin to reveal why he is as he is; why he\ncarries his so called \u201cdark passenger\u201d;\nhis homicidal inner voice, if you like.\nThis alter ego is put to good use when\nchallenged by the \u201cice-truck killer\u201dan unknown assailant who captures his\nvictims (all prostitutes), mutilates them\nand then leaves them literally bloodless\nfor the police to find. As the plot thick-ens, the killer leaves clues for Dexter, to\nlure him in and to \u2018play\u2019 with him. The\nchallenge is unduly accepted by our favourite serial killer with some gripping\nconsequences.\nDexter manages to be captivating,\nmysterious, sad and brutally dark at the\nsame time. It\u2019s definitely worth watch-ing.\nbehaviour and quality of schoolwork has dramatically deteriorated since his parents separated. His\nheartfelt conversations with his favourite teacher,\nMiss Conway, were a particular highlight.\nThe stars of \u2018Educating Essex\u2019, however, are\nclearly the teachers. The programme\u2019s masterstroke is not just restricting their screentime to interactions with pupils. You get to see banter in the\nschool office; senior staff messing around at their\nregular meetings and the head teacher, Mr Goddard, jumping out from behind a door to scare his\ndeputy, Mr Drew.You get to see that these are real\npeople and this leads you to care for them. This is\ncertainly helped by their clear desire to help their\npupils. As Mr Goddard says, the school\u2019s aim is\nthat \u201cnobody leaves without enough qualifications for the next step in their lives\u201d. It\u2019s clear that\nthe staff do everything they can to achieve this\nand it\u2019s uplifting to see when they succeed.\nIn the first episode Mr Drew tells a pupil that\nshe \u201cwill never, ever come up against people who\nare as calm and patient as we are, for the rest of\nyour life\u201d. With all that he has to put up with, all\nthe while remaining calm and focused on his duty\nof care, you can certainly believe him. This programme is the perfect antidote to all the newspaper scare stories about the collapse of the education system. If even a few schools work as hard\nas this for their pupils I think that we\u2019re going to\nbe alright.\nThis is inspiring, well above average television.\nI strongly urge you all to watch the remaining\nepisodes and catch up on what you might have\nmissed online.\nWe\u2019re still\nlooking for new\nwriters - email\ntv.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cThe perfect antidote to\nnewspaper scare stories\nabout the collapse of the\neducation system\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nFly-on-the-wall documentary shows true colours of the state system\nEducating Essex \u2018not as bad as it sounds\u2019\nDexter is my \u2018favourite\u2019 psychotic serial killer\nGeorge Barnett turns his pen to a less provocative subject\nTELEVISION\n(Nice try, give it another month or so \u2013 Ed.)\nEssex girls - can\u2019t beat \u2018em can you?

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 13\nFRIDAY 21 October 2011\nSaturday saw a global day of occupation\nand protest in 951 cities across 82 coun-tries, making this day one of the most\nwidespread days of resistance ever seen.\nApart from Rome, they were also entirely peaceful. This was no random event\nbut part of a global tide of uprising that\nbegan in the Arab spring and has swept\nacross Europe and America. Although\nyou may question the link between the\nprotests in the Middle East and apparent Western democracies two common\nfeatures have ran through them all: high\nunemployment combined with increasing difficulty to live on low wages and\na feeling that the general public have no\ncontrol over their governance.\nThese two themes were the main constituents of a manifesto published ahead\nof the actions on Saturday that aimed to\nvoice the reasons behind these protests.\nIn a style true to the movement the manifesto was produced over four months in\nconsultation with the people involved\nin the movements in Britain, Egypt, Tunisia, Germany, Spain, the USA, Israel\n& The Palestinian Territories, Brazil,\nMexico, Uruguay, Argentina, India and\nAustralia. It highlighted how, whether\nit be Mubarak, the IMF, multinational\nbanks or the G8/20, we are all dictated\nby a few people to whom we never gave\npermission. In the words of the Indian\neco-feminist Vandana Shiva, we demand\nreplacing the G8 with the whole of humanity \u2013 the G7 billion. The manifesto\nstates that more than ever before our\nlives - including jobs, education, health\nand environment \u2013 are shaped by cor-porations, banks, markets and financial\ncrises.\nAlthough the manifesto attempts to\naccurately portray the global movement\neach country and region has taken particular emphasis on parts that are important\nto them. The Middle East is obviously\nfocussed on dictatorships whilst Japan\nhad a Fukushima element to the Tokyo\noccupation. Italy and Spain have emphasised political corruption and America\nand the UK tend to have centred on in-equality. The most common of threads\nthough is that we are born equal, and\nshould be treated so.\nIn the largest UK demonstration \u2013 Occupy London Stock Exchange (still ongoing at time of writing) \u2013 has occupied\nthe space outside St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral\nwith up to 5000 people, after a high court\ninjunction was imposed on the original\ntarget of the neighbouring and privately\nowned Paternoster Square. And not surprisingly inequality is a strong theme as\ninequality in the UK is only second to\nthe US out of Western states. A banner\ndisplaying the slogan of Occupy Wall\nStreet \u2013 we are the 99% - highlights how\nin the UK 1% of the population have accrued a third of the wealth.\nPlacards and conversations echoed this\nsentiment. A placard stated \u2018I have no\njob but now I have an occupation\u2019which\nagreed with the feelings of a surprising\nnumber of young unemployed graduates\nI spoke to who feel they were sold a lie\nabout education. After all that time and\nmoney they are left as part of the ever\nrising youth unemployment. One particular protester, educated to masters\u2019\nlevel, questioned our state\u2019s derision\nof the poor and acceptance of the rich.\n\u201cCurrently I am living on \u00a353 a week\njob seeker\u2019s allowance to pay food, bills\nand other costs in London. This is barely\nenough to even survive but yet the law\nsays this is how much you need to live\non. However they have decided no maximum to live on, people receive million\npound bonuses, where is the equality?\u201d\nThis feeling of injustice is now evolving into an attempt to create a new de-mocracy, one where everyone participates and decisions made at least have\na chance of representing the majority of\npeople. The whole protest in St Paul\u2019s\nworks as horizontally as possible. Everyone has a say in small groups with\na spokesperson sent to give feedback to\nthe whole occupation in what is called a\ngeneral assembly. The common feeling\nis that this protest is there to stay; people\nare planning to camp or make return vis-its. The persistence and growth of this\nmovement across the world is giving\nconstant strength and support. Normally\nprotests are dismissed in the few hours\nafterwards, the people ignored. However, by staging a permanent protest\nthis becomes increasingly difficult and\nthere\u2019s a chance our voices may finally\nbreak through.\nAs one middle aged occupier described\nhow the current way our society functions \u201cconstantly degrades\u201d him, others\nmimicked the Zapatista\u2019s of Mexico in\ndeclaring \u201cYa basta! (Enough!)\u201d\nLast Friday, after a week of revelations\nover wrongdoing in his affairs, the Defence Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, announced\nhis resignation to the Prime Minister.\nThe first Tory cabinet minister to resign\nhas been replaced by Philip Hammond,\nwhose Transport brief is now to be fulfilled by Treasury minister Justine Greening.\nDr Fox has been under a great deal of\npressure to resign after it was discovered\nhe had been granting inappropriate access to both himself and the Ministry of\nDefence to Adam Werritty, a friend and\nlobbyist. Mr Werritty accompanied the\ndefence minister on a number of official\ntrips, including visits to foreign diplomats\nand military figures. He also styled himself as an \u2018Advisor to Rt. Hon. Dr. Liam\nFox MP\u2019 on business cards, despite having no official role in the Government.\nDr Fox apologised to the House of\nCommons on the 10th of October for\nhis actions, but this was not enough to\nquench the controversy over his position,\nand he ultimately resigned on the 14th.\nThe Prime Minister expressed his regret\nin seeing Dr Fox leave the Cabinet, while\nLabour\u2019s shadow defence secretary, Jim\nMurphy stated, \u2018It was inconceivable that\nonce a minister had been seen to break\ntheir own code of conduct on so many\noccasions that he could survive\u2019.\nAt the time of writing, the Cabinet Office report on the extent of the relationship between Dr Fox and Mr Werritty in\nGovernment is yet to be fully released.\nMr Werritty has been interviewed by\ncivil servants as part of a Cabinet Office\nEnquiry, with Whitehall officials said to\nbe alarmed with the details uncovered.\nThe Enquiry has already confirmed that\nLiam Fox did indeed breach the ministerial code. However, the final report is\nexpected to find that he did not benefit\nfinancially.\nThe cunning of Dr Fox\nReporting on the last calamitous cabinet days of the Defence Secretary\nGazing into the soul of the 99%\nPhilip Kent\nLuke Seldon\n\u201cEveryone has a say\nin small groups\u201d\nA whirlwind of business cards and political bust ups for Dr Liam Fox\n\n"

His\nfirst concept was to develop a product\nto help people publish stories around\nsocial media, in particular Twitter. He\nwas bold, and moved from Brussels\nto Silicon Valley with his girlfriend\nwithout knowing what to expect and\nwith only a few contacts. After six\nmonths of hard work and networking,\nhis business, Storify, got $2 million\nfunding from Khosla Ventures and\nalso managed to sucure a co-founder\nin the media industry. Xavier was\njuggling his time between meetings\nwith venture capitalists and coding\nthe product by himself.\nHis start-up, Storify, allows people and companies to create stories\naround posts on social media sites including Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube. He is passionate about the concept of sharing and how his product\nallows people to capture individual\nposts, photos and links that would\notherwise have been lost in the web,\nand create stories around them. According to Xavier \u201cEverybody is a re-porter, but thanks to journalists, those\nvoices can impact wide audiences, be\nremembered, change the world\u201d. His\naim is to reinvent storytelling with\nsocial media; to make everyone a\n\u2018journalist\u2019.\nOne tip he gives to aspiring entre-preneurs: \u201cDon\u2019t ask for permission;\nask for forgiveness.\u201d It is, after all,\nin the words of Steve Jobs, those of\nus who \u201cthink different ... have no\nrespect for the status quo\u201d, that will\nmake a noticeable difference in this\nworld.\nThe second visiting entrepreneur\nwas Josh Liu from Minutebox. Josh\nis an alumni of Imperial College, and\nhis product focuses on getting people\nforming contacts between specialists\nin certain areas of expertise. Though\nthe first iteration of his product got\nsome negative publicity on TechCrunch (a leading technology/start-up blog), Minutebox went on to become a succesful startup, enabling\nindividuals to take part in live chats\nwith professionals in various fields\nthrough looking at their LinkedIn\nprofiles. Josh came from a working\nclass family and fought hard to break\nout of it and build his own business.\nHis biggest piece of advice from the\nevening was to make sure you have\na great team when starting out, as\nthese are the people who you will\nbe spending most of your time with.\nEven though Josh was not a technical\ncofounder, it was his succesful collaboration with the team he formed\nthat ensured the eventual success of\nMinutebox.\nThe visit from Xavier and Josh is\njust the first of many inspiring talks\nImperial Entrepreneurs has planned.\nThe focus of the society is to promote\nentrepreneurship and the idea that\nthere are other prospects for Imperial graduates than the very tempt\u201cStorify allows people\nto create stories around\nposts\u201d\nIn Profile Storify\n\u2022 Launched 2010 with $2M investment from Khosla Ventures\n\u2022 Won SxSW startup competition\n2011 before public launch\nIn Profile MinuteBox\n\u2022 First appearing in 2008, MinuteBox Direct (v.2) launched 2011\n\u2022 Named by TNW as the \u2018standout\u2019\nstart-up at the incubator program\nSeedcamp, London\nBusiness Editors: Nina Kearsey\nBe\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBy\nJamal Khan & Rafal Szymanski\ning route toward investment banking.\nImperial College represents some of\nthe top intellect around the world, and\nit is just this kind of people that are\nable to create innovative companies\nof their own which generate value for\nsociety.\nIf you are interested in entrepreneur-ship, starting your own company, the\ntechnology sector, or just want to listen\nto some very inspiring speakers, come\nto the talks organised by Imperial Entrepreneurs!

    "content": "COMMENT\nYes \u2013 Alexander Karapetian No \u2013 Alexandra Nowbar\nW\ne shouldn\u2019t be so quick to react\nnegatively towards the recent\nintention to change towards\nthe American style system of\nhaving a Grade Point Average\n(GPA) by UCL. Students under the UK classification system are often under great pressures to attain\na degree with 2:1 or above, with those not doing\nso risking slipping completely under the radar of\npotential employers.\nTheAmerican system awards degrees with grades\nworked out from the average of the results of all\ncourses taken. The grades are numerically representative of performance, more so than simply \u2018\u20192:1\u2019\u2019,\nwhere one could be within the range of 60% to 69%,\na large difference in academic performance. The\nsystem also allows for ranking within a cohort, offering honours such as Salutatorian and Valedictorian for the second highest and highest respectively.\nI disagree with such rankings, however, since this\nwould discourage student cooperation and would\nincrease competition, adding another pressure to\nthe myriad already present in typical university life.\nAspects such as a numerical GPA can be used\nto the student\u2019s advantage when looking for a job.\nUnder the American system, since students associate their degree modules with majors and minors,\none could recalculate their GPA using only classes\nwithin the major (e.g. for very specific job applications relevant to the major or to look more attractive\nby eliminating minors which may bring the average down). Applying this kind of system in the UK\nwould provide pros and cons in a threefold manner.\nFirstly, it would allow for employers to get a better feel for how well a student performed over their\ndegree course on average. They would be able to\ndistinguish between a borderline and comfortable\nfirst, useful in pruning the 70 from the 90 per cents.\nThe disadvantage to this is that an average student\nwho endeavoured tirelessly to bag a first with 70%\nor so will not be able to consider themselves safely\nin the same league as those in the 90s. Perhaps this\nis the right way forward though.\nThe second element to consider if this system\nwere widely implemented in the UK is that employers would then be compelled to consider a GPA as\ncriteria for selection, rather than simply the top two\ndegree classifications. By setting the bar reason-ably, one would hope this could prevent the unlucky\nstudents who narrowly miss a 2:1 from feeling like\ntheir degree was a waste of time. Also, those who\nwould normally obtain third class honours could\nstill be taken into consideration, since reshuffling\nmodules in the calculation could allow the blow of\na low GPA score to be somewhat softened.\nLastly, one factor pushing UCL to consider the\nswitch to GPAstyle scoring is grade inflation. Does\na first from 2010 carry the same weight as one from\n1994? Are students getting better/exams getting\neasier? That\u2019s another discussion in itself, but it\nshould be noted that with a GPA system using class\nranking, grade inflation is eliminated. It is particularly evident that an increasing amount of British\nstudents are leaving for American universities. In\nthe US, students can keep their options open by\nway of choosing minor courses alongside their ma-jors. Although this can be said to exist in the UK,\nthe choices are severely limited in comparison. A\nstudent would not have to choose their major until\nthe end of the second year in the US.\nOne could argue that costs remain a significant\nfactor deterring students from the American uni-versities. However, it remains a little known fact\nthat many British students will qualify for help\nas the British are relatively less well off than the\nAmericans. A student with family income of\n\u00a332,000 ($60,000) or below will have zero to pay\ntowards fees, accommodation and even an annual\nflight back home. Students with a family income\nat the UK threshold for aid from grants (\u00a337,425)\nwill still only have to pay a few hundred pounds,\nand those with incomes up to \u00a364,000 still receive\naid from US universities. While the US certainly\nhas more elite universities in the world\u2019s top 20,\nthe UK\u2019s strong position for such a smaller country and population in world rankings must not be\noverlooked. The US degrees last longer, and UK\nstudents can be said to study a more focused curriculum with the added intensity of a shorter space\nof time.\nAlthough my personal opinion remains against\nimplementing the GPA system in the UK since I\nappreciate the prestige associated with first class\ndegrees and feel many benefit from the masked\npercentages and employment securities attached to\nthe current system, I do believe the American style\nsystem has its merits and could be the key to a pro-gressive, internationally unified university system.\nI\n\u2019m here to advocate the British university\nsystem. It should be a walk in the park \u2013\nHyde, not Central. And yes, that was about\nas hilarious as Gurl With Opinion\u2019s article\nfrom last week was profound. She (or the\ntroll) informs us that boys are magnetized by their\nconfidence. I imagine boys reading her pearls of\nwisdom will be sceptical about this presumption\nand perhaps wonder why a girl so confident would\nnot reveal her identity. But that aside (wouldn\u2019t\nwant to make too much of a fuss in case it was a\ntroll), I expect my side of the argument to be easy\nto the point of thinking I could get away with any\nold ramble. However, there\u2019s been too much daft\nwriting of late so I will make an effort to present\na strong case that focuses on undergraduate study.\nThe first hurdle to consider is the obvious financial burden of studying in the US: a minimum\nof 4 years\u2019 study for an undergraduate degree at\naround \u00a330,000 per year. That\u2019s a lot to fork out\nwithout the help of a loan. That\u2019s not to say a student wouldn\u2019t get a government loan, it\u2019s just that\nthe US Department of Education want the money\nback at a rate of 3.4%. Yes, that\u2019s a preferential\nrate when compared to ordinary loans but back in\nBlighty the rate, which used to be 0%, is currently\na meagre 1.5%. These British handouts may not\nbe sustainable, especially with our current level\nof graduate unemployment, but in the current economic climate I might venture that student loans\nare water under the bridge. For the sake of the issue\nin hand (and my mental health) we won\u2019t worry\nabout any of that.\nIn my naivety, I\u2019d expect the next hurdle for a\nhigh school graduate to be what subject to do but\nnot on your nanny. We may not be fond of our obligation to choose a subject of undergraduate study\nin sixth form, but far better to decide then than to\nfloat around university aimlessly taking random\nclasses. In the US a student commonly would not\nhave to declare their \u201cmajor\u201d until the end of their\nthird \u201csemester\u201d and even then a large proportion\nof students change their minds! At Harvard University, for example, a third of undergraduates\nchange their fields after this declaration. Think\nhow much time these students must be wasting.\nThe well-defined pathways in the British higher\neducation system help students maintain focus.\nAnd undergraduate students are known to be susceptible to indecision and easy distraction; more\nchoice is not necessarily a good thing. At Imperial,\npeople can, and do, change courses, but only very\noccasionally. Perhaps this is because we aren\u2019t being bombarded with temptation from a wide range\nof classes.\nI hope no one gives me nonsense about the\nAmericans thus becoming more cultured and well-rounded because ultimately a student can\u2019t really\nbe a jack of all trades; whether it\u2019s before or after\nuniversity, we will all have to settle down and pick\na career path. In theory there is nothing wrong with\ndoing a minor but I feel that our system of having some optional modules within a course is more\nlogical; there, a science student could take an English minor or an art class and because these would\nstill be worth credits (i.e. doing well matters) they\nwould take equal priority to studying for the major.\nI believe other interests really ought to be pursued\nexternally.\nSpeaking of other interests, I imagine the sportier British student might envy Americans because\nof their college level sports. Americans have definitely tilted the balance in favour of promoting\nsport but I suspect they have gone too far. It is\nsometimes said that achievements on the field can\noutweigh academic achievements on admission to\nsome American universities. There is a great deal\nof pressure on universities in the US for their sport\nteams to do well, so one can understand why they\nrecruit in this way. But that\u2019s not all. The real scandal is the escalation of sponsorship of in college\nfootball (American football) and the reported cor-ruption. So let\u2019s not be too jealous, I\u2019m convinced\nthat us \u2018Brits\u2019 don\u2019t adopt the same obsession with\nwinning and thus cheat or break the rules.\nUCL deciding to offer GPAs as an alternative\nto the degree classification disappointed me, initially because I\u2019m a patriot so I\u2019d rather fix any\npurported issues within the current system than\nadopt the American way, but also in part because\nthe continual monitoring reeks of primary and secondary education. So-called grade inflation can be\ncountered by simply relaying one\u2019s actual marks\nand this is not unheard of in the job market.\nIf Gurl With Opinions is speaking her ridiculous\nmind,IfiguredI\u2019dbetterspeakmyslightlymoresensibleone,lestpeoplelosefaithinwomankindaltogether.\nSadly, I\u2019m not sure much can be done to redeem her.\nCould the American university system\nwork here?\nFELIX Friday 21 october 2011 21\n\u201c\n\u201d\n\u2026 the American style\nsystem has its merits\nand could be the\nkey to a progressive,\ninternationally unified\nuniversity system\n\u201c \u201d\nThe well-defined\npathways in the British\nhigher education\nsystem help students\nmaintain focus\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n18\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: Sam Horti\nTim Arbabzadah\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 21 october 2011\nT\nhe question of what happens to us after we die is\none that has troubled us\nas a species for thousands\nof years, and to this day\nmany among us still wrestle daily with\nour own doubt and confusion over the\nmatter. The posthumously themed won-derings of religious movements and\nphilosophers alike have produced many\nweird and wonderful ideas filled with\nfantasy and creativity. The conspicuously man-made nature of the afterlife\nas displayed in modern religions isn\u2019t\nsomething that I feel it would be worthwhile to investigate at great length,\nmainly because of the fact that it is so\npalpable that the term \u201cflogging a dead\nhorse\u201d comes to mind. The grubby fingerprints of mankind are present wherever you look.\nTo give a brief example, I would invite you to call to mind a fundamental\nbelief that many religious people will\nespouse; specifically the idea that your\nown immaterial soul (whatever that\nmeans) leaves your body to travel onto\nthe afterlife after your body has expired.\nThe religions of our time do not seem to\nhave quite the required imagination to\nfree their minds of the earthly shackles\nthat bind them, and therefore we are left\nwith a post mortem experience which\nmay evoke fear or joy in highly developed primates, but would have no effect on an immaterial soul. The eternal\nfires of hell proclaimed in the gospels\ncan be extinguished when you realise\nthat a soul has no skin to feel the pain\nof a burn, and I\u2019m afraid the promised\nvirgins in the Islamic Jannah (paradise)\nare going to have to remain distinctly\nunsatisfied for obvious reasons.\nWhat the concept of an eternal heaven gives many people is hope of a better\nexistence. By simply doing good on the\nearth and acting in accordance with the\nteachings of your chosen celestial lead-er, you can achieve perfection after you\npass away. Leaving aside the implications this has for morality (what would\nhappen without the promise of heav-en?), I would like to ask those of you\nwho hope for an afterlife a simple ques-tion. Would you enjoy heaven? Whenever I have asked myself this question,\nthe answer is always a resounding no.\nHeaven would quite simply be hell to\nme.\nWhat heaven gives us is the offer of a\nnever-ending existence, and personally,\nI do not wish to exist for eternity. The\nthought of being trapped behind the\nbars of being is to me a horrifying one,\nhowever great my existence might turn\nout to be. After all, after my \u201csoul\u201d has\nspent 20 million years inside the pearly\ngates, I think it may struggle to find\nsomething to do for fun. As If anyone\ntells you that they wish to exist forever\nthen it is safe to say that infinity is not a\nconcept they have firmly grasped. Otherwise, it must be accepted that they\nwish to inhabit a realm from which\nthere is no escape, a realm which they\ndesire so strongly that they are willing\nto pay the measly entry fee of their free-dom, surely one of the most important\nthings a \u201csoul\u201d possesses.\nOf course this offer that heaven gives\nyou, and that God gives you, is not an\noffer at all. It is an insistence. An insistence that you must spend your timeless\nstay endlessly praising and worshiping\nthe ever-watching big brother. Worst of\nall, alongside the limitless grovelling\ncomes a further requirement \u2013 that you\nmust enjoy yourself in the process. This\nidea, that you have no choice but to\nhave fun whilst you submit completely\nand selflessly to an unelected dictator,\nis something that I find indescribably\nnauseating and very creepy. As Christopher Hitchens so wonderfully puts it,\nit would be akin to living in a \u201ccelestial\nNorth Korea\u201d. The difference being of\ncourse, as Hitchens himself points out\nis that \u201cat least you can fucking die and\nleave North Korea\u201d. Taking part in this\neverlasting horror show isn\u2019t something\nthat I could possibly wish on my worst\nenemy, let alone myself.\nAs I see it, not having an afterlife is\nby far and away the most attractive op-tion. Living life as if there is nothing\nmore to come is surely the most ful-The Heaven of Hell\nSam Horti\nYou\u2019d think they would have got around to installing an escalator by now\nAs this year\u2019s cohort of new graduates\neases itself away from university life,\nmany will either be beginning or continuing in their new careers. However, it is\nimportant to realise that unemployment\nremains an ever present issue for gradu-ates. Unemployment finds itself at its\nhighest total since 1994, with just over\ntwo and a half million people finding\nthemselves out of work \u2013 a significant\nproportion being newly graduated stu-dents. Despite these solemn figures, it is\ngood to take a step back and realise that\nImperial degrees remain highly sought\nafter, and that we must not lose focus\non what this university has to offer other\nthan study.\nThe university experience has become\ninternship-focused as of late, with undergraduates \u2013 from first year onwards\n\u2013 relentlessly applying for summer place-ments. The tenacity and drive of said students towards securing a career must be\nadmired, but at what cost does it come?\nThere are those who can balance the\nhunt for a suitable internship alongside\nacademic work, social and sporting activ-ities. However, there are also those who\nwill struggle with the balance that such\na schedule demands. It is necessary\nfor these individuals to realise that not\nall aspects of the university experience\nneed to be juggled at once.\nInternships provide a good deal of experience in the \u2018real world\u2019, with the promise of a salary providing students with a\nsignificant incentive (especially with the\nspectre of student loans awaiting grad-uates). However, they are by no means\nthe be all and end all. Despite the latest unemployment figures leading to the\nperception that internships will give you\na head start, employers will also be impressed by a dedication to college life,\nor relevant experience towards the line of\nwork you take interest in \u2013 not necessarily the first class honours you achieved.\nIt is important to remember that not\nevery aspect of university leads towards\nyour future after graduation. This is why\nthe comments such as those made this\nweek by the Arts & Entertainment Board\non the issue of bar night policy must be\nadmired. The fact that club chairs have\na common goal towards the improvement\nof social events is a testament to the\nthriving extra-curricular side of Imperial\nthat is often overlooked by many. Gain\nrelevant experience for the future if you\nare able, but make sure to find this not\nonly in the workplace, but elsewhere too.\nFELIX\nThe path to graduation:\nnot all about internships\nfilling and productive way to live, and\neven the religious pay attention to this\nfact. I do not know a religious person\nthat honestly conducts themselves as\nif this earth is some sort of trial, one\nbig cosmic joke to which the punch\nline comes in the form of slavery to the\nalmighty God who so graciously gave\nus life in the first place. Only once you\nfully realise that this life is the only one\nthat you\u2019re going to get are you able to\nlook upon the face of true freedom and\nembrace your ultimate independence.\n\u201c \u201d\nTaking part in this\neverlasting horror show\nisn\u2019t something that I could\npossibly wish on my worst\nenemy, let alone myself.\nWant to stop\nobnoxiously titled\ncomment pieces\nlike the one\nopposite going\nin?\nWhy not write for us then!\nSend your submissions in to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDLC \u2013 To pay, or not to pay?\nS\no, a little over a week ago Valve brought\nout a fairly large update for their flagship game Team Fortress 2. So what?\nIgnoring the fact that TF2 is now over\nfour years old and still receiving content updates which it celebrated this time last year\nwhen microtransactions were first introduced into\nthe game - the MANN-conomy Update (I\u2019m not\nmaking this up). Amongst other things the update\nallowed players to purchase in-game weapons and\npurely cosmetic add-ons for the nine classes with\nreal-world cash. The update was initially received\nwith mixed reviews \u2013 \u2018buying your way to victory\u2019\nand \u2018Valve\u2019s sold us out\u2019 were two of the many\ncomplaints angry fans put forward, whilst others maintained that nothing was on sale (at least,\ngame-changing wise) that couldn\u2019t be found by\npenniless schmucks. One year on, and everything\u2019s\n(mostly) settled down.\n\u201cThe answer is far from a\nsimple yes or no - it almost\nfully depends on how it\u2019s\nimplemented\u201d\nFor me, this raised a question \u2013 are microtrans-actions and, alongside them, DLC (Download-able Content) a good or a bad thing for gaming\nas a whole? The answer is far from a simple \u2018Yes,\nit\u2019s the perfect next step\u2019 or \u2018No, I\u2019d rather jump\nin a pool full of broken glass\u2019. It almost fully depends upon how it\u2019s implemented. Not fully? No.\nQuite possibly I\u2019m nostalgic about the times when\nyou bought a game and you got everything in one\ngo, and now, paying extra for content that should\nhave come with the product in the first darn place?\nMicrotransactions and DLC: a bright idea or a big mistake? Laurence Pope decides\nHmm.\nIn all fairness Valve has managed to implement mi-crotransactions and distribute DLC in the best way\npossible. Most of their products (TF2, L4D1 and 2,\nPortal 2) have and continue to receive free large updates that throw in a lot of extra content: extra maps\nand campaigns for the L4D series; new challenges\nfor Portal 2; and new weapons for TF2 \u2013 the sort of\nstuff most other game companies would charge for.\nTo date, only TF2 and Portal 2 feature micro transac-tions, though the Portal 2 \u2018store\u2019flopped rather miser-ably.\nThe TF2 \u2018store\u2019was implemented remarkably well,\nhowever. All weapons and most cosmetic items are\nfindable in-game through a random drop system,\ncraftable through another menu, and there\u2019s even an\nin-game trading/ bartering system so technically one\ndoesn\u2019t have to use the store to gain an advantage. In\npractice though weapons are a little harder to come\nby, but the point still stands \u2013 no money has to be\nspent in order to find everything that has any significant impact in battles. It\u2019s by no means perfect, but\nGabe Newell and the TF2 team have yet to go down\nthe Bobby Kotick route.\nTo give Valve extra credit, not all the money they\nearn stays with them. Valve introduced a scheme allowing modellers and mappers to submit their weap-ons, cosmetic items and maps to them. The best ones\nget implemented into the game, and 25% of the proceeds go to their creators. Big bucks can and have\nbeen made \u2013 after one update, one creator received\na cheque for \u2013 wait for it \u2013 $47,000. If that\u2019s not rewarding one\u2019s fans, I don\u2019t know what is.\nNow that\u2019s enough about a half-decent way to\nimplement DLC and micro transactions. The immediate case that springs to mind regarding a poor\n(read: disgusting) way to do DLC is neatly illustrated\nby Bioshock 2. The problem? After the first \u2018DLC\ndownload\u2019 was released, it was discovered that the\ncontent delivered had actually been on the disc the\nGaming in Reverse \u2013 Because old gold is the best gold\nWelcome to Gaming in Reverse, where every week\nwe use The Power of Writing to reverse time on a\ngame series or remake. We\u2019re flipping history to\npretend the newest games are the oldest games!\nCan we prove that older is actually sometimes bet-ter?\nFinal Fantasy: Because IX\nis obviously the best one\nWe thought it was crazy when Square Enix swaggered into the crowded ring of Japanese RPGs with\nits debut entry Final Fantasy XIII. With one beautiful but flawed game it had thrown the gauntlet\ndown at its own feet, challenging itself to make 12\nsemi-sequels, through commercial success or fail-ure, to reach an ultimate Final Fantasy that would\nlive up to the name.\nIf its fourth sequel Final Fantasy IX is anything\nto go by, then it will be an easy triumph. By taking\ndaring risks with the stagnant JRPG formula, the\ncreators have proved themselves to be heroes worthy of their self-imposed quest.\nFans will remember that where Final Fantasy XIII\nhad a glossy sheen of High-Definition polish, Final\nFantasy XII instead revelled in its matte textures\nand an earthy look that suited its world so well.\nBut we hadn\u2019t seen anything yet. Sure, Final Fantasy XII was richly drawn with subtle texture work,\ngaming\u2019s equivalent of painterly brush strokes, Final Fantasy IX instead celebrates fine art itself with\ngorgeous, hand-painted backdrops. It simply boycotts the loss that comes when concept art is translated into polygons.\nAnd yet they\u2019ve lost none of the drama. Despite\nfears that the rigid hand-drawn backdrops would\ntake away from the trademark flamboyance of Final Fantasy\u2019s story scenes, the whole adventure is\ninstead given the air of a performance. Plot now\nunfolds on fixed sets, and without the luxury of\ndynamic angles and motion-blur zooms, the burden of entertainment is left to well-written dialogue\nand charmingly theatrical movements. Final Fantasy X\u2019s blunders, voice-acting as a whole having\nbeen completely excised, deemed unfit for the job\nof carrying this magical adventure is completely\nscrapped. In its place is witty, and sometimes touch-ing, on-screen dialogue that is a simple delight for\nbeing written in pixels and read in the mind \u2013 and\nit\u2019s all the better for it.\nIn fact, pretty much all of it is. For all these the-atrical, literary, and visual delights FF IX is still a\ngreat game with secret items to be discovered and\ntense battles to be fought. By stripping away the\nmodern gleam and glitz Squaresoft (as it is now\ncalled) has made a world that feels lived-in, a story\nthat feels crafted and characters that feel cared for.\nIt is a wonderful tale, one that, if something cataclysmic should happen, we\u2019d even be content to\ncall our last taste of the series.\nThis would be a worthy Final Fantasy.\nIf you have an idea for a Gaming in\nReverse or any games article for that\nmatter, then get in touch! Wedon\u2019t bite!\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOmar Hafeez-Bore\nwhole time. The DLC download was not content \u2013 it\nwas a key. You had already bought the extra content\n2K were charging you for.\nLater, 2K Games commented on the locked con-tent, claiming it was \u2018necessary to maintain consistency between all players regardless of whether they\npurchase the DLC or not.\u2019 This paper thin rationale/\ndirty lie cut little ice with the rightly put-out gaming\ncommunity. You do not do DLC like this.\nBut, for this to be a marginally balanced argument\none has to look on the other side of the fence. You\nneed to worm into the heads of the game developers\nand see it from their point of view. DLC and micro-transactions allow developers to create new maps,\nweapons, campaigns, or what have you, without\nneeding to initiate a long and expensive game development cycle. It\u2019s cheaper to make compared to a full\ngame, and they make a fair amount of money from it.\nTF2\u2019s store does so well that Valve was able to make\nTF2 free to play and still pump out profitable updates.\nOne does need to remember that game companies\nare, at the end of the day, businesses out to make mon-ey. That\u2019s what a business does, and from this point of\nview DLC and microtransactions are simply a logical\nstep forward. Fans will buy new content, helping to\nfill the coffers of the afforementioned companies.\nBut is it the best way forward? To commit the argument of moderation, everything needs to be balanced.\nDLC and microtransactions can enrich a game, provided they\u2019re fairly priced and offer sufficient con-tent. On the other hand, it\u2019s no substitute for new\ngames; too much DLC stifles creativity. Overuse has\nthe potential to make comapnies lazy, wallowing in\nold products to earn them money. Like technology,\ngames need to keep inovating and testing new things\nout.\nValve has shown that innovation, DLC and micro-transactions can walk hand in hand. They are able to\noffer huge content packs for free, which in turn endears them to their customers, keeping them loyal \u2013\nand keeping them buying. But I\u2019ll be honest here; as\nI said at the start, I\u2019ll never fully come round to\nthe idea of paying extra for something that really\nshould have come with the initial product.\nFour years old and still going strong\n2K\u2019s DLC disaster - how NOT to treat your\ncustomers\nFELIX\n36 Friday 21 OcTOBER 2011\n\n"

Munnar is a gem in the heart of Kerala, nestled\nin the Western Ghats, and is home to some\nof the most breath-taking mountain and plantation scenery the country has to offer. After\nsurviving a treacherous bus ride up windy\nhills I was lucky enough to catch some of the\nsights on offer.\nWishing you were here\nner you\u2019ll be just fine. And even in my case,\nthe afternoon swims in waterfalls, friendly\nwaves from tea pickers and the freedom of\nan absolute must, and the daily rental fee is as\nlow as a standard tuk-tuk ride anyway. And\nof course, don\u2019t skip on the freshly brewed\nchai.\nAll in all Munnar turned out to be one of\nmy favourite destinations in India, especially\nafter the hustle and bustle of the dusty, tem-pley north. It\u2019s a brilliant place to unwind,\nand a great portal to the rest of \u2018God\u2019s own\ncountry\u2019; it\u2019s a place where not even the torrential downpour of the thick monsoon can\nbring down your spirits.\n\u201c...afternoon swims in\nwaterfalls, friendly waves\nfrom tea pickers and\nfreedom of the road\u201d\nChris Richardson\nEscaping India\u2019s dusty north for some much needed rest\nand recovery in the plush green scenery of Kerala\nMunnar: your cup of chai\nGet there: Gospel Oak/Hampstead (Overground),\nor Kentish Town (Northern line)\nSee: One of the best skyline views of London\nEat: Amazing gastropub fare at The Bull and Last\nCost: \u00a310-20 for a meal, or \u00a32-7 for nibbles\nVisit Parliament Hill this Saturday to browse one\nof the most picturesque weekly farmers\u2019 markets\nin London and for stunning views of the capital\u2019s\nlandmarks.

While it serves as the perfect hub for\nnecessities, the true beauties of Munnar lie\nin the outskirts. Instead of succumbing to the\ndreaded tuk-tuk drivers, I decided to rent myself a motorbike and head for the scenery.\nThe sights on show were nothing less than\nfantastic: I spent the day venturing further\nand further afield, zipping by luscious lakes,\nplush plantations and wild elephants, occasionally stopping to take a snap or two. Highly recommended is the ride to Top Station,\nabout thirty kilometres out of town, where\nyou can pick up a tasty thali and admire the\nGhats and gaze into the neighbouring state of\nTamil Nadu.\nMotorbiking might evoke images of cruising in the sun, but be warned \u2013 the ride is\nnot for the faint hearted. Blissfully forgetting\nabout the altitude and the monsoon I opted to\nwear beach gear, only to be caught by torrential downpour. The slippy roads would have\nbeen tolerable had I not also neglected the\nsetting sun; needless to say, the ride home in\nthe dark was a slow one. To add to the thrills\nI tried to convince myself that I was a main\ncharacter from a zombie movie.\nBut as long as you\u2019re not a complete span-Travel on your doorstep\nStunning skylines from Parliament Hill\nPlanning a trip to Munnar? I stayed at a wonderful hotel\ncalled Tea Castle, nestled ten kilometres out of town. The hotel offers peaceful serenity and unbeatable views of the surrounding mountains and tea fields from its brilliant bedroom\nbalconies. The staff were very helpful when it came to organising day trips, and the top-notch Keralan cuisine dished up\nat the classy rooftop restaurant always went down a treat.

We are led to believe that we\nare the only Students\u2019 Union in the UK to\nhave published such a document.\nSo what is it?\nThe NSS Response is a booklet we have\nwritten that summarises our analysis of\nthe NSS data, addresses concerning (as\nwell as positive) issues in college and\nprovides 35 \u201cUnion Recommendations\u201d\nto help improve the Student Experience at\nImperial College.\nIt was written by myself, Scott Heath\n(Union President) and Andrew Keenan\n(Representation Coordinator) over the\nlast month. Whilst putting it together\nwe made sure it was student focused\nand we used numerous direct student\nquotes from the NSS 2011. We also felt\nit was important that it was as student-friendly as possible to read. So, as you\nJason Parmar\nDeputy President (Education)\ndeducation@imperial.ac.uk\ncan see, we have including several useful\ninfo-graphics, began with a \u201cTop 10\nrecommendations\u201d and kept the main\nmessages from the response as concise\nas possible.\nWhy?\nAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all read previously in\nFelix, Imperial College dropped 11 places\nin the 2012 Sunday Times League Table,\nthe first time Imperial has scored outside\nthe top 4 in fourteen years.\nUniversity League ranking tables\nhave, over the last few years, given\nmore weighting student satisfaction\nand teaching over categories such as\n\u201cLearning Resources\u201d and \u201cStaff-Student\nRatios\u201d. However, the NSS response isn\u2019t\nonly about trying to get Imperial back\nup the league tables. The low results\nin the NSS reveal a genuine problem\nwith the quality of teaching at Imperial.\nIf college takes on board and effectively\nimplements what this response from the\nUnion and student body recommends\nthen we should see a dramatic increase\nin the quality of teaching and student\nsatisfaction at Imperial College.\nThis is our best opportunity to change\nthe student experience at Imperial\nCollege to make it better for all of us. We\nneed to make sure your year/dep reps,\nwhile on Student-Staff Committees,\nraise the concerns you are having in\nyour department and work together\nto provide solutions. Instead of solely\nmaking complaints, we should be proactive and work together with staff in our\ndepartments to address the issues that\naffect the Student Experience.\nI hope you enjoy reading the NSS\nresponse, and if you have any questions\nplease e-mail us or, even better, come by\nthe Union Offices (2nd Floor of the Union\nBuilding) to have a chat about it!\nNational Student Survey 2011 Response\nyour\nsabbaticals\nimperialcollegeunion.org/sabbs\nKeep up-to-date with your Sabbaticals at:\nimperialcollegeunion.org/nssreport\n\n"

Point 34 from Section E\ngrants the Union President permission to\nsuspend \u201cany defendant officer in relation\nto whom [he] is the relevant authority\u201d.\nThe Staff/Student Protocol is a document which governs the relationship between the Union, its officers and staff. It\nis designed to protect the democratic structure of the Union from staff interference\nand, in this case, protect staff from public\ncriticism by officers. As a result, meetings\ndiscussing staff matters are held in closed\nforums and student media cannot directly\ncomment on the performance of a member\nof staff. Controversy arose due to ambiguities regarding the interpretation of the reg-ulations. Kwan had referred to the member\nof staff in question directly but in a private\nforum, specifically by email.\nThe policy also prohibits direct interaction between students and staff where it\nwould involve criticism of work perfor-mance, as this may be considered a form\nof harassment. A case of constructive dismissal could ensue if a member of staff\nfeels the need to resign after they believe\nthe Union or any of its officers has harassed them.

In this case, Kwan\nreturned to his duties after just two days\nafter Heath closed the investigation with a\npunishment as per the Union\u2019s Disciplinary Policy.

However, Jacky expressed his\nconcerns about Union finance to a member of staff directly. It is up to interpretation whether his frustrated tone could be\nconstrued as directed to the individual.\nThe CGCU President received messages of support from his committee and faculty students when his suspension became\nknown, many of whom believe the actions\nwere unwarranted. Jacky is known to have\ncommented on the speed of the payment\nsystem, having previously taken a position\nas Vice President of Finance and Activities for the CGCU. In dispute was whether\nthe comments, maintained as constructive\ncriticism, were inappropriate when directed towards a member of staff.\nThe frustration appears to stem from\npayments requested 6 weeks ago with\nalleged little indication for reasons for\ndelay. The faculty obtained approval for\ntheir grant in August last year with the\nfunds being transferred this week. The\nCGCU President was particularly focused\ntowards the arrival of a shipment of yearbooks required for Commemoration Day,\nwhich occurred on Wednesday 19 October.

Drawing galleries from not just the major art hubs\nbut from the world over, they come\nto present the best of their wares \u2013 a\nshopping opportunity for a (predomi-nantly Russian) few, for the rest of us,\na chance to bask in an abundance of\nthe foremost in contemporary art.\nIt\u2019s the meeting of diverse minds\nthat makes Frieze unique. Individual\ngalleries bring their own eclectic col-lections, adding to the broader tapestry of the occasion. From the irreverent humour of Elmgreen & Dragset\u2019s\nlife-like baby asleep in its cot outside\na hotel room door (complete with \u201cdo\nnot disturb\u201d sign hanging from the\nhandle) to the more cynical humour\nof Michael St John\u2019s Bathroom Wall\nStall, a collage of corporate distaste\nand pop culture (scrawled with an\nunintentionally Frankie Boyle-esque\n\u2018haunted pussy\u2019), Freize touches every shade in the spectrum. And even\nbeyond into the darker extreme, the\npure cynicism of Andra Ursuta\u2019s de-flated, semen-spattered, Crush, crip-plingly detailed complete with wispy\npubes has a fascinating gloom that\nmakes it hard to look away from.\nIf that could be described as sub-lime, then Takeshi Murata\u2019s psychedelic Popeye Zoetrope was certainly\nridiculous. His acid-trip trompe l\u2019oeil\nof tens of Day-Glo Popeye figurines\nspinning in a box of dimensions\nthat shift as you view it from different angles was about as close as the\nart world gets to legal LSD. Slightly\nless colourful was Rashid Rana\u2019s mosaic of a busy South Asian junction\nmade up entirely of postage stamp-sized monochrome pictures of itself\nat different times of day. The notion\nof small snapshots, moments in time,\nbuilding to create a deeper, inherent\nstory indulged the latent physicist in\nme.\nTaking a step back from the works\nthemselves, it\u2019s intriguing to observe\nthe personalities of the different pop-up\ngalleries, and more so the trends in taste\nbetween nationalities. Contributors from\nLondon and New York dominate and\ncollectively illustrate the differences in\nartistic palate either side of the pond.\nThe Modern Institute of Glasgow\npresented a selection of Jeremy Deller\u2019s reverential posters that combined\npunchy Carmen Miranda colours with\na clean-cut, quintessentially British\ndesign, in homage to Keith Moon,\nPaul Gascoigne and the Happy Mondays, amongst others.\nThe whole affair is something for\nthe eyes to savour, much sweeter than\nthe sum of its parts, that stretches well\nbeyond just the installations.

Therefore, doctors who\nhave been working for long periods without sleep\npose a safety risk to both themselves and their patients because they are more likely to commit medical errors and make poor judgments than if they were\nwell rested.\nHence, this study was designed to find out whether\ncertain drugs can be used to resolve the problems of\nfatigued and sleep-deprived doctors.\nThe study, carried out as a randomised controlled\ntrial, looked at the effects of Modafinil on the performance of 39 healthy male doctors who have been\ndeprived of sleep for one night. 20 of the doctors\nwere given Modafinil while the other 19 were given\na placebo.\nA series of tests were then carried out to assess\nthe cognitive processes of the doctors and their\nclinical psychomotor skills. Interestingly, those that\nwere given the modafinil drugs performed better in\nthe psychological tests than the placebo group. The\nmodafinil group also behaved less-impulsively in the\ndecision-making tests; showed a better result in the\nworking memory and planning tests; and were more\nresponsive to changing demands. This indicates that\nthey had greater mental flexibility.\nOn the other hand, the placebo group was expected to perform sub-optimally in the surgical motor skill\ntasks under conditions of fatigue as a previous study\nfound that these tasks are susceptible to the effects of fatigue. It is worth noting, however, that the\nmodafinil group performed the same as the placebo\ngroup in this task showing that modafinil administration did not improve psychomotor performance. It is\nthought that little demand is placed on higher-cogni-tive centres to carry out the surgical skills. Therefore\nan improved cognitive process has no advantage for\ndoctors performing surgical tasks.\nThe researchers stress that until further investigations are done that the use of pharmacological\nenhancement in the workplace cannot be recom-mended. A larger sample size, long term study and\ndifferent characteristics of the sample have yet to be\ndone to confirm the findings of the study.\nThe investigation only involves the effects of one\ndose of modafinil over a short period of time. In addi-tion, the participants were only young doctors and no\nolder participants were included. Therefore, before\na sound conclusion about the benefits of modafinil\nto the sleep-deprived doctors can be drawn, further\nresearches are needed. There are also challenging\nethical considerations that have to be taken into account very carefully.\nUntil then, perhaps, a good-quality sleep is the\nbest solution. Farhan Abdullah\nClimate change and global warming caused by\ngreenhouse gas emissions have important implications on re-shaping Earth\u2019s landscape. Animal species can suffer dramatic consequences,\npossibly even extinction, from these changes.\nScientists have been studying how climate\nchange affects the habitat of frogs, and in what\nways changes to their habitat conditions could\nlead to the risk of extinction of some species and the consequent loss of biodiversity\namongst the amphibians.\nIn the study, scientists from the University of\nEvora in Portugal and the Brown University in\nRhode Island, US, used a model that attempts\nto predict the geographical movements of 15\ndifferent species of amphibians in the western\ncoast of US up to the year 2100, under two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios \u2013 one\nmoderate and one more extreme. The models,\nbased on weather data of the same region between 1961 and 1990, analysed the geographical distribution of the different species and\npredicted for each of them the possible range\nof movements (technically defined as \u201cshifts\u201d)\nthat the species could undergo because of the\nmodifications to climate conditions.\nIn their work, published this year in the international journal Ecology Letters, Regan Early\nand Dov F. Sax observed that there can be discontinuities in the path of frogs\u2019 movements.\nThese discontinuities are called gaps and consist of particularly hostile geographical regions\nthat block the migration from one place, whose\nclimate becomes hostile for the survival of the\nspecies, to another place where a more suitable\nclimate exists. These regions could be physical barriers such as mountains. \u201cFor example,\n[one frog species] may be unable to shift into\nits full potential future range because climate\nvariability after 2050 causes the landscape\nconnecting northern California and Southern\nOregon to become climatically suitable only\ntransiently\u201d, explain the scientists. In simple\nwords, if the species wants to move it should do\nit very quickly, otherwise the region will be not\naccessible anymore and a gap will block future\nmovements. Scientists claimed that gaps in the\nclimate-path or range shifts of a species could\nseriously endanger its survival in the long term\nup to 2100.\nBut not all hope is lost for the frogs. The\nscientists discovered two factors that can determine the ability of the frogs to emigrate to\nplaces with more suitable climatic conditions,\nin either greenhouse emission scenario: spreading the population in a certain territory (defined\nas dispersal), and the frog\u2019s ability to persist in\na certain geographic area for a short time, even\nin non favourable climatic conditions (called\npersistence). The better the species is at these\ntwo things, the better their chances of survival\nwill be. The most surprising discovery was that\nparticularly persistence ability up to one decade\nwould be the most favourable factor to expand\nthe range shift of a species in a scenario where\nlocal climate fluctuations and variability occur.\nOther scientists have argued some limitations\nof the study, in particular regarding the assumption that the species\u2019 distribution is in equilibrium with its environment, and the assumption\nthat species cannot live in the future in climatic\nconditions which are different from those they\nare used to live. For instance scientists suggested that in the Pleistocene (from 2,588,000 to\n11,700 years ago) some amphibians could live\nunder climatic conditions that were very different from those in which they live nowadays.\nAlthough adaptation of the species is a further important factor to be investigated, the present study gives some guidelines which may be\nuseful in order to conserve the biodiversity of\nspecies. For example, we could promote movements along certain territories by assisting or\nincreasing populations that naturally establish\nthemselves in the territories or mitigating the\nimpacts of climate changes using irrigations to\nimprove habitat quality. In the case when gaps\nare present in the climate-path, we could even\nconsider whether to use or not the controversial\nstrategy of \u201cmanaged relocation\u201d or assisted\nmigration of some species into more suitable\nhabitats.\n\u201cFurther refinement and application of cli-mate-path analysis [\u2026] would improve our\nability to forecast species\u2019 responses to climate\nchange and inform our use of alternative conservation strategies\u201d, comment the two scientists in their work. In other words, if we can\nunderstand where they would like to move, we\ncould help them do it.\nAntonio Torrisi\nFrogs\u2019 habitats affected\nThis frog is WELL DENCHHHHHHH... They should name it Judi\nGraphene based electronics\nGraphene is a unique material that promises to\nrevolutionise electronics. Consisting of a two dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon molecules\n(effectively a single layer of graphite) it is the\nthinnest, strongest and most conductive material\never discovered. As such it could lead to the development of flexible computer displays, lighter\nairplanes and faster Internet connections. The\ngovernment has recently recognised the promise\nof this material, with Chancellor George Osborne\npromising \u00a350m for graphene research.\nNow a team of scientists from the University of\nManchester, including Professor Andre Geim and\nProfessor Kostya Novoselov, who were awarded\nlast year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in\ndeveloping a method to produce the material, have\nannounced that they are one step closer to fulfilling graphene\u2019s full potential. Writing in Nature\nPhysics earlier this month the team has described\nhow graphene had previously not exhibited Anderson localization, an effect common to many\nconductors in which they act as insulators at low\ntemperatures. However, by creating a structure of\nalternating layers of graphene and boron nitrate,\nnicknamed the \u201cgraphene \u2018Big Mac\u2019 \u201d, the team\nwas able to cut down on external potentials affecting the graphene and observe the effect.\nThe lead author of the Nature article, Dr Leonid\nPonomarenko, has said \u201ccreating the multilayer\nstructure has allowed us to isolate graphene from\nany negative influences of the environment and\ncontrol graphene\u2019s electronic properties in a way\nit was impossible before.\u201d\nProfessor Geim added that \u201cLeaving the new\nphysics we report aside, technologically important\nis our demonstration that graphene encapsulated\nwithin boron nitride offers the best and most advanced platform for future graphene electronics. It\nsolves several nasty issues about graphene\u2019s stability and quality that were hanging for long time\nas dark clouds over the future road for graphene\nelectronics.We did this on a small scale but the experience shows that everything with graphene can\nbe scaled up.\u201d He hopes that in the coming months\nscientists will be able to use this research to create\nnew and improved models of graphene transistors.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nSurvival guidelines as frogs migrate due to climate change\n\n"
