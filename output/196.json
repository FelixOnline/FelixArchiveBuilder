Altough the Judo Club fully appreciate any space we are given in' Felix', we\nwould rather that the facts given bear a closer resemblance to the truth than was the\ncase in the last issue,\n. TWO points require correction:\n1) The venue for our home matches is the\nBudokwci and\n2) Training conditions are very much closer\nto the prim at ive than the 'superb'.\nIn anticipation of more accurate\nre pao ting on future Club activities.

Gordon Hall. HEALTH ROOM HATES SOUTH SIDE\nThere's the case of the girl who, after a South Side party, needed 9 stitches in her\nnose the day prior to her wedding. Just\none of the many accidents that the Health\nRoom has had to deal with as a result of\npeople passing through locked glass doors,\nfalling down the spiral staircases ( esp.\ndangerous to girls wae ring high heels ),\nand students climbing out of one room into\nanother via the window.\nThe Health Room is also worried about\nescape during fire. Not only are the stair cases connecting landings dangerous with a crowd rushing down, but the concrete stairs\nare faced with wood; and how many residents\nare familiar with the escape routes from\nthe balconies to the ground when the lifts are NOT TO BE USED? These too are of a dangerously narrow-radius spiral nature.\nIn short then, the Health room consider the South Side Halls of Residence\npoorly.designed for use by students, who\nare naturally higher spirited than the\naverage human being. South side has,\nperhaps, more dangers lurking for the us -wary than any other I.G. building.\nWATCH IT, STYNX !\nBrighton Students' Carnival Magazine has\nbeen sent to the Public Prosecutor foi lowing complaints about its pornographic\ncontent.

To\nobserve and film the island animals he plotted their daily routes\nthrough the forest, built hides\nand camouflaged photographic\nequipment. He obtained unique\nfilm sequences of lemurs, by\nplaying recordings of their voices\nto attract attention and received\nsharp warning calls in response.\nHe later remarked that the creatures would probably have responded equally well to the William Tell Overture.\nIn conclusion he answered\nquestions, and the audience\nshowed their appreciation of such\na warm personality with treme nI dous applause.\nparking\nfrom page 1\nOn being asked why this area\nshould not be used for parking\ncars, as the scooter owners were\nnot quite so desperately short of\nparking space as car-owners, he\nreplied rather (vaguely that the\nCollege had not considered it\nsuitable.\nMr. C. Hingley said he thought\nthe road in front of the hostels\ncould be used to park one line\nof cars\u2014as it was last year \u2014 without causing any inconvenience.\nHe was at once accused of wishing to desecrate the beautiful outlook of the halls. Mr. Hingley\ndefended his suggestion by pointing out that such a line of cars\nwould not be visible from any of\nthe bedrooms, and that apparently\nit was not intended for the \"beau-ti ful outlook \" to be appreciated\nfrom the ground floor lounges, as\nthe windows of these were draped\nwith heavy, vision-impeding net\ncurtains. Mr. Stevenson was not,\nhowever, sufficiently impressed to\nadopt the idea.\nVarious elaborate and expensive schemes were put forward by\nresidents involving the building of\nunderground or multi storey car\nparks. Mr. Stevenson made it\nclear that all such propositions\nwere out of the question as the\ngovernment did not and would\nnot allow any money for the\nbuilding of car parks for students.\nThus, when the two new blocks of\nhostels went up in Prince's Gardens in two years' time the situation of the residents would be\nmuch worse as the present car\npark would have to disappear,\nand instead of 30 spaces for 400\npeople there would be no places\nat all for 1,200 people.\nThe position of the College as\na whole was also said to be des-per ate, as when the building programme was complete, the number of parking spaces available\nwould be less than a third of the\nanticipated number of cars.\nH.T.

He studied engineering\nbut war came before he qualified. In the Revolutionary Army\nhe met theatrical artists and with\nthem set up the highly experimental Proletcult Theatre in\nMoscow. He experimented with\nfilms and was invited to make\npropaganda films to glorify the\nRevolution. \"Battleship Potemkin \" and \"October\" were highly\nsuccessful and established Eisenstein as a great artist.\nIn later years he had difficulty\nin reconciling his creative artistry\nwith the ideological message his\nfilms were supposed to convey.\nMeanwhile he taught film technique at the Institute of Cinematography founded by Lenin. With\nthe threat of war in 1938 he was\nasked to produce a patriotic film.\nHe chose the story of Prince\nAlexander Nevsky, set in the 13th century. This was so successful\nthat from 1941 to 1947 Eisenstein worked on his masterpiece\n\" Ivan the Terrible.\"\nIvan was to have been in three\nparts, but the third was never\nfilmed. Part I( finished in 1945)\nis largely a chronicle of history :\nit was a great success and earned\nEisenstein the Order of Lenin.\nPart II is a more personal story\nof Ivan as a man with doubts\nand fears, an insight into the\nmind of a powerful ruler. The\naction concerns the Boyars' plot\nto usurp Ivan. The film was not\napproved for ideological reasons,\nand was refused exhibition until\nten years after Eisensteins' death\nin 1948.\nIn \"The Boyars' Plot\"\nsound and colour (in the banquet\nscene) are used as media for expression in a way that has not\nbeen bettered to this day. \" It is\na thrilling film, showing Eisenstein at the height of his powers,\na film artist in unequalled control\nof his medium.\"\nCome and see it on November\n22nd.

    "content": "FELIX EDITORIAL\nWHEN THE THIEVING HAD TO STOP\nA trail of petty dishonesty and some major thieving over the\nlast two years has at last been brought to a head. Two students of\nthis Union have been caught stealing and sentenced by the executive.\nThis action is long overdue, and the fact that it has been hidden by\na cloak of secrecy is most unsatisfactory. Accepting that the situation is \" delicate \" one must still act positively, and indicate that the\nmatter is not one to be taken lightly. \"Borrowing\" articles from the\nUnion Is in itself disgraceful, but stealing money is shocking. This\nis a Students' Union, and the .whole structure depends upon the\nhonesty and integrity of the student who makes it. If standards are\nso low that persons will unashamedly steal from their own union then\nthat union must collapse.\nLast year two coats were stolen; this year several small items\nhave been reported missing, and Felix itself reports a constant disappearance of revenue. The paper costs four pence; if you pay only\nthree pence you are in principle as guilty as the man who takes a couple, without paying and explains that the Union can afford it.\nAbroad one hears tremendous admiration for the British integrity and\nhonesty. South Americans will tell you proudly that in England you\ncan leave a bicycle outside while you shop ; it will still be there when\nyou come back. In their country this is extremely unlikely. But is\nthis attitude disappearing ?\nIt is extraordinary perhaps that a theft as blatant as taking\nmoney from a collection box should have been caught. Countless\nthefts must have gone unnoticed, for after all, the Union does hot\nhire detectives to watch \"hard up\" students. It is perhaps regrettable that the guilty parries are being shielded from the full glare of\npublicity, for there is little more effective a deterrent than public\nhumiliation.\nWILL UNION MEETING SET THE, TREND\nTo-morrow sees the first I.C. Union meeting of this academic\nyear. At the time of going to press neither the President or the Secretary had any idea what the final agenda would be. This first meeting\nis traditionally the one where the previous year's accounts are presented\u2014a laborious process which has been much reduced in recent\nyears. Inevitably the motion about where our carnival proceeds\nshould go will come up, and doubtless mental health, narrowly passed\nover last year, will receive considerable support. There is talk of a motion concerning the I.C. mascot \" Phoenix,\" and where it should\nbe shown ; this topic has received much publicity of late, but is unlikely to provide exciting debate. Perhaps it will be left to Mr.\nBerry and his projected enquiry into the \" state of the Union \" to set\nalight the stream of passion reserved by a few for this hardy topic.\nMr. Berry was instrumental in nearly filling the R.G.

RIDING\nCENTRE42 The speaker at the next meeting of the Literary Society, to be\nheld on Wednesday, November\n13th, at 7.30 p.m. in Falmouth\nHall, will be Clive Barker, the\nDirector of Drama at Arnold\nWeskers \" Centre 42.\" The following week, on November 20th, the society will have as its guest\nJohn Chapman, author of some\nof the famous \" Whitehall\nFarces\" (\" Dry Rot,\" for ex-ample) and many television plays\nincluding the recent series \"Hugh\nand I.\" Mr. Chapman has announced his intention of \" killing literature stone dead,\" so this\nshould prove a most interesting\nevening. All members of I.C. are\nwelcome at these meetings, which\nare quite informal and provide\nample opportunity for discussion\n(and coffee) with the speaker.\nDepartmental It would possibly be an exaggeration to state that all innovations in this College were conceived in the Electrical Engineering Department; it would be\ntrue, however, to say that this is\noutstanding in its progressive ness. Under the ambitious leadership\nof Sir Willis Jackson it has been\nthe first to attempt to civilise its\nundergraduate philo technic morons by providing a course in\nhumanities. Second year electrical students in addition have lectures weekly in Social Anthropology and in Political Science.\nA third lecture course is soon to\nbe added to these in Industrial\nPsychology.\nThe Electrical Department was\nalso first in instituting the third\nyear economics course held at\nL.S.E., and is alone in requiring\nall its students to take it.\nINTERDEPARTMENTAL\nCOURSE\nTh6 first interdepartmental\ncourse ever at I.C. was proposed\nby the Electrical Engineers, this\nbeing in the Science of Materials.\nThis subject is considered to be\nof fundamental importance to\nmost branches of science and en-g in ee ring, and the course is open\nto postgraduates in the departments of Chemical, Electrical and\nMechanical Engineering, and of\nChemistry, Mathematics, Metallurgy and Physics.\nAnother idea of this department has been to have as lecturers two engineers also employed in Industry at the present\ntime; the close contact thus\nachieved between Industry and\nthe Department being of benefit\nto both.\nCHEAPER T.V. Professor C. Cherry's work on\nthe compression of bandwidth of\ntelevision signals is showing signs\nof success. At present, television\nis very inefficient in that a very\nlarge amount of superfluous detail is transmitted along with the\nessential signal. Professor Cherry\nand his research group have been\nable to remove about two-thirds\nof this excess detail from a television picture without causing\nany apparent deterioration of the\npicture. The remainder can be\naccommodated in a narrower\nband-width. The quantity of information that can be transmitted along a line is limited by\nthe bandwidth of the individual\nsignals. Thus, the B.B.C. who\npay \u00a310,000 per mile of line per\nyear to the G.P.O., would have\ntheir costs appreciably reduced if\nsignal bandwidth s were reduced\nby two-thirds.\nH.T.

Mr. Stevenson replied that this was reserved for scooters and\ncycles. When told the surf a ee was so slippery that no scooter could\npossible stand up on it, he remarked that \" no one had ever told him\nthis.\" It was further suggested that the energies of the workmen at\npresent engaged in knocking holes in the concrete walls by hand, be\ndiverted towards surfacing this plot, as presumably there was some\nmachine that could carry out the former activity.

SSSSS!!3S^ COLOR PROBLEM\nSir,\nI have a complaint about the college barber which I would like\nto bring to the notice of other members of the Union through your\npaper.\nOn the 1st of this month I went to see the barber to book an\nappointment for a friend. He told me he would not make an appointment for my friend if he had hair like mine. (I am an African and\nhave curly hair.)\nThe implication of this is that those who have hair like mine\ncannot avail themselves of a service provided in college. What is\nmore, as there is no announcement to warn us, we have to go to\nthe barber severally to face the indignity of being told that we have\nhair of the wrong sort!\nI feel strongly that any service provided under the auspices\nof the Union should be available to all members. If the purveyor\nof a service feels himself unable to perform it as fully as possible\nhe should immediately confess the fact and then be replaced by someone more versatile.\nThis whole incident is thrown into sharper relief by an encounter\nI had with this same barber over a year ago. On that occasion I asked\nhim for information about purchasing a pair of clippers. He refused\nto tell me because, as he said, I would use it to cut my friends' hair\nand thereby threaten his livelihood. Therefore, one way and another,\npeople with my kind of hair are not supposed to have their hair cut.\nYours sincerely,\nSAM APEH\n(Zoo. P.G.) Ed.\u2014Complaints of this nature should be treated extremely\nseriously by the Union. This paper will support fully any effort to\nprevent such discrimination.\nSIRS: H:::;:: \u00bb KZ I GET DRESSED!\nDear Sir,\nI.C. needs a boost for budding\nBeau-Brummels. This College has\na singular lack of elegance; rivalled only perhaps by a coach outing to Wigan or a minor agricultural show, it is populated by\npeople who are content to drift in\nd ribs and drabs through an unspectacular and colourless higher\neducation.\nTo these students I would say,\nlet us try and bring some style to\nthis College; in clothes, mannerisms and speech. If you come\nto College; in a suit then let it be\na clean one with a quarter of an\ninch of cuff showing; if you do\nnot possess a clean suit then come\nin other garb but try and make it\nf usta little bit startling and different. Of course there are many\nwho aspire to no more than dirty\njeans and sweaters, I have nothing\nagainst this, but do make sure the\nsmuts on the jeans are placed in\na balanced way and in contrasting\ncolours. If you must have dirt\nunder your fingernails then try^\nand make it dirt of an interesting\nhue, something to match bloodshot eyes perhaps.\nWatch a group of Students\nwalking, standing, sitting or talk-ing; hardly a pretty picture. Try\nand look elegant when you are\nrelaxed, do not get hunched over\na newspaper in the Union lounges,\nbriefcases clutched in the lap or\nby the edge of the chair; relax,\nstretch, even yawn and do read\nthe Society columns.\nSpeech is where lack of elegance is really shown up, I do not\nrefer to accents but to phrase o logy. English has become a language of tinned clich es based\non a small number of overworked\nwords. Elegance of speech can\nbe brought into a conversation of\nalmost any intellectual level; try\ncalling your friends \" A second\ncousin to a Rhubarb Tree\" or\n\" Horace Hotpot' instead of\n\" Spawry-Eyed * * * *;\" even\ntry inventing a few words, their\nuse can bring startling results:...\nFinality, do not neglect the\nSocial Graces, to extract a pearl\nfrom the world you must know\nhow to open an Oyster.\nSo, fellow shadows, let us cultivate elegance and nurture colour\nand movement, without of course\nbeing affected; who knows? we\nmay rise to a strata unbounded\nby mere test tubes, mine shafts\nand spanners.

Similarly our\nindividual magazines\n\"FLEET\" intends to incorporate\nALL COLLEGE magazines and\nthus become the ONE big magazine for the whole of the University. I think it is high time for\nthis.

The myth of this being\ntoo large and impersonal a unit is\ntossed around without any attempt at justification. It is just\nnot true\\ A General Studies\nlecture a week is no substitute for\na night at an L.S.E. bar social.\nThe exaggerated emphasis\nplaced in the constituent colleges\nis reflected by the fact that we\nhave had to wait seven weeks\nfor the first I.C.

Most students of I.C. have\nnever even seen him. Nearly all\nother London colleges have mascots on permanent display in their\nUnion buildings. A mascot is the\nfigurehead of a college and helps\nto maintain that spirit which is so\nessential for an active union.\nHere at I.C. there is a great\ncollege spirit within the three\nconstituent-colleges\u2014spirit which\nis fostered by the presence (or-cas ional absence of Spanner,\nTheta and Mitch. We feel however that I.C. spirit should also\nbe encouraged and that I.C. should become more of a single\nunit within U.L. U.

OUT OF CUP\nI.C.2, Goldsmiths 3.\nBy Kerry Peters\nLosing a Cup match is always a rather bitter experience, especially in such an early stage of a competition, and the fact that\nWednesday's game could\" easily have gone to either team did little to\ncheer the I.C. XI. But they had no reason to be ashamed of their\nperformance for, considering the appalling conditions under which\nthe match was played, both teams' play was admirable.\nI.C. settled down the more\nquickly and were unfortunate to\nmiss some early scoring chances.\nAs it was, the first goal came for\nGoldsmiths from a penalty flick\nawarded after a shot from a corner was stopped on the line by a defender's foot. I.C. fought back\nand equalise d through a, fine goal by Anketell after 20 mins., and\nthe score at half-time wasl-1.\nGoldsmiths Take the Lead\nEarly in the second half a defensive muddle let in Goldsmiths\nfor their second goal, but on\nthree-quarters time I.C. equalise d again, this time when the Goldsmiths goalkeeper had missed an\neasy clearance, leaving an open\ngoal for Hough to score. With\nabout ten minutes left to\" play,\nand the game still in the bab ance, Goldsmiths took the lead from a short corner and I.C. were fighting\nfrom behind again.\nPenalty Missed\nA draw, which probably would\nhave been the fairest result, was\nalmost within their grasp, when\nthe Goldsmiths goalkeeper sat on\nthe ball and I.C. were awarded a penalty flick. Unfortunately\nPhillips's shot hit the crossbar,\nand with only a few minutes of\nplay left I.C. didn't look like\nscoring again.\nOf the two defences, EC's, looked the more solid, but their\nforwards, although moving well\ntogether at times, lacked the necessary finishing power, so that\npossibly on this account the Goldsmiths victory was a deserved\none.\nCAMBRIDGE\nSQUASHED\nThe weekend saw the annual\npilgrimage of two squash teams\nto a provincial university. Along\nwith the ten players went an assortment of fans and the Captain\nof Golf. The latter was seen only\nonce throughout the week-end\nand then loudly declared himself\nto be in search of \" randy birds \";\nhe was seen no more.\nThe reason for the weekend\nwas somewhat different, and although one member was seen with\ntwo strange girls late on Saturday his squash appeared unaffected. We continue to have an\nexceptionally strong team, probably the strongest college team in\nthe country, and our record shows\nwe will take some beating.\nPreview\nAthletics:\nWed., Nov. 13\u2014U.L.

RUGBY\nStill Unbeaten\nThe feeder sides in the club, the\nEx 1st and A's) still boast an\nunbeaten record after four\nmatches and the Ex A's only defeat has been at the hands of the\nBl's. Such strength at these levels\nhas helped the 1st XV to put up\nsome very good performances\nlately even though they have suffered from a few injuries among\nthe backs.\nFaults are still present, how-ever, the main one being the\nteam's slow starting. Being 14\npoints down to Kings after 15\nminutes and 11 down to Richmond after 10 minutes just isn't good en aug hl The team finishes\nstrongly enough, but we must\nlearn to go off with a bang before\nthe important Cup Match on\nNov. 20th.

Defeats by Kings\nand U.C. as compared with draws\nagainst Christ's College and Guys\n(the latter we finished with9 men)\nillustrate this inconsistency.\nIn contrast, the 4th XI are now\ntop of their league, being undefeated in 4 matches and having\nscored 29 goals.\nI TODAY I Can I.C.

    "content": "FELIX7 Miserable Morphy\nEverything started normally\u2014R.C.S. travelled by way of Gloucester Road to Putney and Guilds by High Street Ken., where Rod\nJones, Guilds Vice-President, had his first meeting of the day with\nthe gentlemen in blue. The trouble concerned the Guilds hand luggage \u2014several large Michelin lorry tyres. During the day he had\nhis name taken once, was told not to be cheeky, and asked to keep the\ncrowd in order countless times.\nOn arrival at Putney, 250 Guilds and 150 R.C.S. were told to\nfight 50 Mines. At the time this seemed a great move ; after all, who\npinched the Spanner ? But, when custard pies had been pitched into\nChris Tye's and Bob Schroter's faces by Jim Marshall (Vice-Presi-dent, Mines) \" I did not know what I was doing.\" Mines, after a bombardment of 1^ cw t. of tomatoes, 1 cw t. soot and \\ cw t. flour,\nfelt they were so outnumbered that they just ran, and ran, nearly to\nHammersmith.\nNODDY BIKES\nThen there followed a long\nwait while R.C.S. and Guilds\nofficials tried to organise themselves into two separate sides and\nstart again. But very few people\nwere co-operating, there were\nvarious distractions. U.C. came\nand nearly stole a fire-extinguisher off Jezebel which upset\nR.C.S. and then two policemen\non Noddy Bikes roared through\na crowd of Guildsmen, being\nliberally covered in flour on the\nway.\nBOAT RACES\nA brief melee between the two\nColleges took place, and four or\nfive R.C.S. and 1 Guildsman lost\ntheir trousers. This led on to the\nBoat Race. The Lowry was won\nby Guilds by two lengths over\nR.C.S. Another wait. Another\ninterruption by U.C. Then the\nMorphy Race. . This also was\nwon by Guilds, 2\\ length winners\nover Mines.\nAfter another interruption\nfrom U.C. the journey back be-gan. This took some time since\nthere are several zebra-crossings,\nand London Transport were\ntroublesome as well. On arrival\nat Prince Consort Road via South\nKensington, a ring-a ring o' roses\nround the Albert Hall was performed and that was that! !\nIN RETROSPECT\nThis year's Morphy Day was\npathetic. There were too few\nR.C.S. and Mines, there was very\nlittle College spirit\u2014-e.g. when\nPete Cunningham, R.C.S. VicePresident, was being de-trouser ed without success, no R.C.S. men\ncame to assist. Surely, the idea\nof Morphy Day (other than the\nboat races) is to have good boisterous fun, not to hound a minority miles down the tow\npath. If the constituent Unions\ncannot organise their big day of\nthe year better there is no point\nin holding it.\nN.J. W. SILWOOD IDYLL\nSome people like their weekends carnal, others, intellectual;\ntwenty-seven of the latter, perhaps also attracted by the economics\nof the thing, en coached on Saturday, 2nd November, for Silwood\nPark, Sunninghill, for one of Touchstone's Weekends. They were\nsurprised by the hut accommodation, but it was pleasant enough, and\na walk through Windsor Great Park on Sunday morning was delight-ful. Food was excellent and company congenial.\nMr. Frank Greenaway was un- borne in mind, at least one group\nfortunately unable to address us, was surprised at the views at tri bu being in hospital, but Mrs. Greenaway gallantly started the proceedings with her views about the\nRobbins report, the Two Cultures, and the emancipation of\nwomen. A discussion followed,\nand after dinner the company\nbroke up into three groups which\nattempted to answer such specific\nquestions as : What, if anything,\ncan be done to bridge the gap between the two Cultures at University, Grammer School and Primary School levels?; are the aims\nlisted by Robbins for Higher\nEducation (a) the right ones, (b) in the right order of importance,\n(c) exhaustive? has the emancipation of women been beneficial to\nmen? and so on. The discussion,\nat least in your correspondent's group, was of good intellectual\nstandard, and a fair balance was\nstruck between progressive unanimity and democratic disagree-ment.

The early morning crowd were treated to\na Boomalak'a. A duck fell into the Serpentine. Mike Cox was seen\npicking plastic daffodils. They matched his yellow tartan pyjamas.\nA group photograph was taken on Albert's feet.\nMeanwhile back on the road\nBo, just being run in after his\nmajor operation the week before,\nwas experiencing some valve\ntrouble in Brixton. At Norbury\nhe had a seizure. His engine had\nonly been rebuilt on Thursday.\nAfter working on him for an\nhour, he went like a Bo-mb right\nthrough to Brighton, spending\nmuch of his time in the oncoming traffic lane, preceded by a motor cycle escort, and followed\nby the Land Rover maintenance\ncrew. On one hill, free wheeling,\nhe managed to reach 50 m.p.h. However, he did disappoint\nmany people when he went up\nhills. They were expecting him\nto stop. Bo hit Brighton at 1.15\np.m., having averaged 14 m.p.h.. Harry Watson and Pete Moss,\nthe two drivers, went with Bob\nSchroter to the Motor Club\nLuncheon at the Neville House\nHotel, where they met Col.\nBrowne, Hon.
