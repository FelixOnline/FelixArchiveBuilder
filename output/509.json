Eilon,\nChairman of the Refectory Committee\nThe boycott of the Southside Refectory on February 8th was\ncalled for the purpose of expressing students' dissatisfaction\nwith the quality of food and services. I very much regret that\nthe U GM found it necessary to take such action, since blanket\ndisapproval of a service is singularly unhelpful, and it is only\nthrough constructive criticism and positive suggestions that\nimprovement in quality can be made.\nDuring the last two months, the President of the Union was asked on\nfive separate occasions to compile a list of complaints and suggestions\nand to discuss them with the Domestic Secretary and the Refectory\nManager. When the list was eventually submitted, it consisted of brief\nsurveys carried out by students of the three union refectories. Some of\nthe information in these surveys is un doubt ably useful and is being now\nconsidered; some of the suggestions are inevitably contradictory, and it\nis noteworthy that not all the comments are critical; it would certainly\nbe erroneous to conclude from the surveys that the majority of the\nrefectory customers are dissatisfied.\nBut the point that I must make is that these surveys were sent to the\nDomestic Secretary three or four days before the boycott took place,\nand obviously after it was announced. How can the boycott possibly be\njustified when we had no opportunity to study the list of complaints, to\ndiscuss them, and to take action where- appropriate?\nIn a leaflet distributed by pickets on February 8th, appealing to\nstudents who even like the food at Southside to support the boycott, a list was given of eleven alternative restaurants \" of comparable prices\"\nin the vicinity of the College. On what evidence was such a statement\nmade? If the President of the Union conducted a survey of prices at\nthese establishments, why did she not submit the evidence to me or to\nthe Domestic Secretary? I have grave doubts whether it can be shown\nthat prices at these places compare favourably with ours for the same\ntype of food. But if anyone has information to the contrary, I would like\nto have it, and I would certainly investigate the matter.\nSo, what has the boycott achieved? First, it had a detrimental effect\non the takings in the refectory, and in this respect the adverse publicity\nand the sustained unwarranted attacks on the refectory are possibly\nmore damaging than the one-day boycott. The result is that the\nfinancial position of the refectory account is being undermined, and\nsince the account is not allowed to be run at a deficit, the burden in the\nlong run will fall on the customers.\nSecondly, the boycott has dealt a severe and unjustifiable blow to the\nmorale of the refectory staff. Although attempts were made to explain\nthat the boycott was not aimed at Southside staff, they - and indeed the\nrefectory staff as a whole - inevitably regard this action as a criticism of\ntheir work, particularly as the publicity campaign waged at the U GM and elsewhere has specifically centred on the quality of food, on its\npreparation and on the standard of service. This de moral ising effect is\nmost unfortunate, since I can vouch for the fact that the refectory staff at\nall levels have been sincere in striving to provide as good a service as\npossible. If they perceive that their efforts are not in the least\nappreciated, it would not be surprising if some become cynical and\napathetic.\nThirdly, I believe that the credibility of those who have waged this\ncampaign has been seriously tarnished. They appear to be motivated\nby action rather than reason, with deplorable consequences.\nI therefore appeal to all those who use the refectory facilities to show\ngood sense. The food and service are, of course, not perfect. Perfection\ncannot be attained at mass-feeding outlets at popular prices, and\nalthough some people expressed in surveys a willingness to pay more for\nbetter quality, this will not suit the majority of refectory customers. I believe that quality has greatly improved in recent years, but we are\ncertainly not complacent There is room for further improvement, and\nwe are constantly examining means for achieving it. The customers can\nobviously make a contribution to this process by making their views and\nsuggestions known to us, but my plea is: be constructive. Vicious\ncriticism and blanket disapproval - as expressed in the recent campaign\n- do nothing but damage.\nTHE MEANS TEST AND YOU\nThe ICU grants campaign is now under\nway. In the next few weeks, informative, and\nhopefully useful, articles will show the main\ninjustices and anomalies in the present\nsystem and point out courses of action which\nyou as individuals and collectively can take to\nrectify these.\nThe focus of action presently is the means\ntest. The large response to Michael Arthur's articles on covenanting, and to the present\nNUS campaign, are an indication of the\nimportance of the subject to both parents and\nstudents. A Government survey in 1974/5\nshowed that 75% of students did not have\ntheir award made up to the full amount by\ntheir parents. There is no legal obligation for\nparents to make up this amount. Especially\nfor London students, and in particular IC, life\nJUSTA GIGOLO\nI wonder why Marlene Dietrich (now 78\nyears old) chose this film for her first screen\nappearance for 17 years? Apparently she\nfound David Bowie (who plays the 'hero') a \"very interesting star\" - quite a fair comment\nabout someone who has renounced the rockstar world and who now describes himself as\n\"a quiet chap who travels a lot\"!\nThe film is set against the background of a tortured yet decadent Berlin during the\nperiod 1918- 1928and traces the struggle of a young gentleman (David Bowie) who arrives\nat the Great War just as it ends - too late for\nhim to perform with honour and is thus left\nwith no clear sense of purpose. Returning to\nBerlin from France he discovers that his\nfamily's elegant town apartment has been\nturned into a seedy Boarding House; his\nfather has suffered a stroke upon hearing that\nthe war is lost and his mother (Maria Schell) is\nworking in undignified circumstances at the\nnearby Turkish Baths. What hope can there\nbe for an officer trained for battle and heroism .\nis expensive enough on a full grant, and\ntherefore even harder with less. Our parents\nalready pay for our education through\ntaxation, as we will for the next generation. So\nwhy should they pay twice?\nThe parental means test applies to all\nstudents, receiving mandatory awards from\ntheir local authority, who have not been\nfinancially self-supporting for the previous\nthree years. Since most students spend at\nmost one year in industry after leaving\nschool, the majority are subjected to the\nmeans test. It seems strange that legal\nminority lapses at the age of 18, with the\nexception of students. It can not be right for\nan adult to be compelled to depend on\nfinancial support from his/her parents. The\ndecision is to pursue a further education\nin a land of unemployment and inflation?\nHowever, all is not lost for one whose\nvulnerability makes him desperately attractive to women, and we see Kim Novak\nintroducing him to the kind of sophisticated\nelegance that only an older woman can\nprovide, while an upper class prostitute\n(Erika Pluhar) gently instructs him in the art\nof flexibility and adaptation.\nHis old army captain (David Hemings)\npersuades him that he must join the new\nmovement to the right - the path to a new\nGermany - but to no avail.\nBy chance, while moping over the loss of\nhis childhood girl friend (Sydne Rome) he is\noffered an opportunity to escort an elderly\nwoman, and almost without realising it, he\nbecomes just a gigolo, under the command of\nMarlene Dietrich.\nThe film, directed by David Hemings, was\nclearly intended to be a moving tragedy (with\na hint of comedy) about a confused and\nuncertain young man desperately turning\nabout to find a direction in life, and unable to\nconceive how others could adapt so well, so\ncourse clearly should be the decision of the\nindividual alone with the guidance of parents\nand teachers, and not dependent on parental\napproval and finance.\nIn recent years, grants campaigns and\ndemonstrations have lost direction, losing\nthe support of the students and the impact on\nthe Press and education authorities.\nCynicism and apathy have left activists going\non marches which degenerate into '-'days-out\" in London, with the majority seeing the\nwhole issue as a pointless exercise. This year\nspecial attempts are being made to show the\nrelevance of the campaign to all students,\nculminating in a demonstration in London on\nMarch 9th. As Mary has said, an IC float is\nbeing arranged; anyone interested should\ncontact Tim Hillyer (Maths 2) or Sheyne\nLucock in the Union Office.\nTim Hillyer\nExternal Affairs Committee\nquickly. By taking the line of least resistance,\nhe is continually swept along subject to the\nwhims of others.\nBowie is undoubtedly well-cast and is\nrequired to say little throughout the film\nreminding us of his past involvement with the\nart of mime. I couldn't help thinking, though,\nthat his speaking voice was just not quite\nright- and it was therefore good that he didn't have to say much.\nHowever, like so many other films, this one\nnever quite made it. The impressive opening,\nthe stunning location shots (it was filmed\nentirely in Berlin) and the moving theme\ntogether with fine supporting actors, led one\nto anticipate far more than the film was\ncapable of giving. It was like one long\napp et ising introduction to something that\ndidn't come. Suddenly, the film was over with\nwhat was surely intended to be a climax - but\nwasn't. As a result it left me with no positive\nlasting impression - save one of acute\ndisappointment. The story was good, the\nacting was good, the setting was good - but it\nnever got off the ground.\nSheyne Lucock\n\n"

If Mr. White\nhad been able to control his\nindignation sufficiently to read to\nthe bottom of the page, he would\nhave noticed that the article was\nwritten by Mary Attenborough\nand not be me.\nWelfare Day and the articles in\nthe preceeding edition of FELIX were not designed to express a particular viewpoint on any\nsubject but to present a number of\ndifferent opinions and sets of\ninformation in order to help\npeople make up their own minds\non the various issues raised.\nFor the purposes of my job as\nWelfare Adviser, my personal\nviews are irrelevant. I am only\nconcerned with presenting alternatives never with foisting\nopinions and I have never\nattempted to voice my personal\nviews on such matters, in FELIX or anywhere else.\nIf Mr. White is interested in*\nconsidering the wisdom of\ncommitting actionable libels\n(especially against lawyers), I would be happy to advise him!\nYours faithfully,\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\nDear Sir,- Bearing in mind the\npoints raised by Bob Bradley in\nhis letter to FELIX last week, as\nChairman of IC Liberal Club.

It couldn't possibly be\nthat they want to break the\nshackles of Islam and have a Western education, to be free to\nwrite critical letters to newspapers\nand to protest about govern-ment s'( \"blasphemy\" - Ayatollah\nKhomeini), to drink alcohol, to\ngamble, to steal without having-their hands chopped off or to buy\nsex without being liable to be\nhanged for adultery?\nIf they really want to criticize\nWestern Society then let them do\nso from their repressive (to women\nand non-moslem at least) Islamic\nRepublic and not when they are\nliving in safety and hypocrisy\nhere.\nA. Walker, Chem. P.G. Dear Sir. - We would like to\nanswer the points made by Mr. Thomson in his letter last week\nwith reference to strengthening\napartheid and to comment on the\nissue of picketing interviews held\nhere by firms operating in South\nAfrica.\nMr. Thomson is putting\nforward that the only way of\nstrengthening apartheid is by\nvoting or joining the South\nAfrican army. Surely, any person\nwho puts the fruits of his training,\ninitiative and experience into a company is actively supporting\nand strengthening that company.\nIt is such companies that have\nbuilt up and are maintaining the\napartheid system. Their massive\nprofits rely on the cheap labour\nand minerals provided by the\nblacks and their land.\nMr. Thomson also claims that\nthe presence of English speaking\nwhites weakens the Afrikaaners'\nposition. The Afrikaaners' are not\nstupid or inexperienced as far as\nmaintaining their lucrative position goes - the introduction of\nother whites into engineering jobs is not to take the jobs of\nAfrikaaners but to fill the\nvacancies created by their policy\nof not letting blacks become\nengineers with any responsibility.\nThe introduction of highly\ntrained people from Britain and\nother countries thus enables the\ncompanies to keep the blacks\nuneducated and in a position for\neasy exploitation.\nBut to take the above points\nfurther, every individual plays a role in the struggle for or against\nthe apartheid system since they\ncreate an atmosphere of opinion,\nwhich, for instance, either\ndiscourages or encourages people\nto take jobs in South Africa. This\nrole is not insignificant.\nFinally, on the issue of having\na picket at the interviews for such\njobs. We support picketing these\ninterviews and, having discussed\nthis with many people, feel it\nimportant to clarify what we\nmean by picketing. We mean\nserious picketing, the purpose of\nwhich is to have detailed\ndiscussions not only with the\npeople entering and leaving the\ninterview room but also with\npassers-by. As a general principle\nwe believe that it is only in\npossession of the facts relating to\nthe situation and with thoroughgoing discussion to\nestablish the validity of such facts,\ntheir importance and relevance\nand to develop an overall analysis\nof the situation, that a person can\nmake a proper decision.\nFor this particular picket we\nfeel the aim of discussion should\nbe to establish: -1) The situation in South Africa\nand the means by which it is\nmaintained.\n2) ^'he role played by a person\ngoing to work in South Africa.\nYours faithfully,\nP.

A cult hero in\nEngland, he is an exciting artist who can\nnumb the senses and flare the imagination\nwith enviable ease. Anyone who has seen the\nabove films may well expect a minor\nmasterpiece produced on an in hi hit iv c budget. Well this time I believe lie even\novercomes the budget.\nDonald Pleasence plays Dr. Sam Lootnis. a psychiatrist who treats mad Mike lor 15\nyears, during which the lad never speaks but\njust slates at a wall. Fortimalcly Ihis period is\nomitted from the film and the story resumes\non October 30th1978. Mike suddenly\ndecides to skip the loon ie bin in Loomis' car\nand returns to Haddoiilicld lor Halloween.\nLaurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a plain, studious\nvirgin who, along with her two friends Annie\nand Lynda, becomes (lie centre of the\nconstant (although distant) attention of\nMichael. She sees a strange masked face at\nevery corner. Carpenter cleverly uses the\nassociation of the moving camera shot with\nthe killer's eyes to produce fear at every hedge\nor tree.\nLaurie is babysitting that night( conveniently) and also her friends happen to\nbe doing likewise over the road. They,\nhowever, plan to use the opportunity to\nentertain their male friends in all sorts of\ninteresting ways. The director has now set the\nscene for the gruesome events of that evening.\nThe action is genuinely shocking without the\nneed for rivers of blood - no, no that would\nannihilate its icy elegance, (indeed, even\nTony Hancock as the reluctant blood donor\nwould supply more than appears in the\nstory). Carpenter chooses instead to weave\nsuspense into every frame. This ensures that\nyou look for every detail in the dark rooms; a hint of white mask or flash of steel. Thus you\nbecome part of the farce, making the whole\nfilm enjoyable and pleasantly shocking.\nThe monster (Tony Moran) does a lot of\nheavy breathing and is cast as the bogey man a Halloween trick on legs, the maniac who is\npurely evil and the sadist who takes pleasure\nin his work, all at once. Promiscuity is dealt\nwith swiftly and painfully in an Old Testament style. The girls are your outer self-roaming dark rooms, leaving doors not only\nopen but also unlocked - while Laurie is the\nhealthy virgin who overcomes all.

The film had caught my\nimagination after hearing the above poem on\nCapital Radio^ coincidence? ) which I thought was somehow compelling. I hoped\nthat my Halloween experience would not\naffect my opinion of the film. Judge for\nyourself.\n\" Magic\" is, broadly speaking, the story of\na man's tragic love for a married woman and\nhis battle with success. Anthony Hopkins\ngives a superb performance as Corky, a talented magician. He has an initial flop with\nhis act due to a lack of stage presence, but\nafter incorporating Fats, a ventriloquist's dummy, he has more success. Fats is a foul\nmouthed extrovert, everything that Corky is\nnot, but perhaps wishes to be. Ben Greene\n(Burgess Meredith) discovers Corky and\nnegotiates a big T.V. deal. The act\nmeanwhile has become famous and Corky cannot bear the strain. He disappears to his\nold home town and meets Peggy, (Ann-Margaret) who is an old flame. He relies on\nFats to trap his beloved and slowly slips into\ntotal schizophrenia. The bulk of the film\ndeals with this relationship and Corky's mental decline.\nIt is totally unfair to compare this film with\nHalloween in any way. It is another type of\nhorror: more subtle, not intended to shock\nbut to arouse mental terror which cannot be\neasily expressed. The violent moments are\ndealt with as they should be - as coarse, brutal\naction. You can almost feel the pain in fact.\nAttenborough must be congratulated for the\nway in which he contrasts Corky's schizoid\nsolitude with the mild mannerisms when he is\nwith Peggy. Fats is not the ideal dummy, but\nhe takes on more and more life as the film\nprogresses. I found the quality of dialogue,\nacting and direction very high and just\ncannot wait to see more of Anthony Hopkins.\nI came out of the cinema, not with an audible\nbuzz, but with racing mental activity. The film thus seemed to last for hours longer than\na mere 107 mins. I don't wish to say any more\nabout this film because I feel it may spoil your\nenjoyment. It is strange, compelling, eerie.\nWhat better recommendation could you ask\nfor?\nP.S. Lovely pic's by kind permission of 20th Century Fox (Magic) and Miracle Films\n(Halloween). Many thanks from the\ngroveller dept.\nNext week - Sgt. Pepper perhaps.\nMark Smith\n\n"

U. Cup.\nIn the first game played on Saturday at Chislehurst a very close-fought game was marred only by a poor referee whose knowledge of\nthe rules was non-existent, positioning d is bol ical, and fitness pathetic.\nThe referee capped his performance by booking the Fifth's captain\nAlan Cable (the mild-mannered sweeper who often quotes lines from\nShakespeare at opposing Forwards). On the credit side the Fifth's always looked in command in this first match and Aled Phillips\nproduced a storming performance making the first goal for John Healy\nand scoring with two other spectacular efforts.\nIt was with this in mind that the lead when Bob Dhillon broke up a Fifth's looked forward to the Middlesex attack and laid the ball\nreplay at H arlington on out to Dam ion Kelly who ghosted\nWednesday, (several players past three defenders before\nseeming far happier to be going to passing the ball to John Healy\nthe ground by coach than who was left with the simple task\nsomeone's car). This match was of slotting the ball past the keeper\nhowever to prove one of the most from about thirty yards,\ndramatic ever seen at Harlington. with IC now ahead Middlesex,\nThe early running was made by true to the spirit of this cup-tie,\nthe Fifths and two fine early goals came charging forward and for\nonly served to spark Middlesex the last twenty minutes play\ninto action. The first goal by flowed from end to end with both\nDennis Cook, a very handy one, teams having several chances to\ncoming from a Stu Dillon corner score. In fact in the dying minutes\nand the second an unstoppable a Middlesex forward did break\ndrive by Al Cable. For the through the IC defence, and it\nremainder of the half Middlesex was only a breathtaking save bt\nwere doing most of the attacking Steve Veats that maintained IC's and only some fine defending by lead.\nIC kept the score to 3:2.

With only ten men the Fourths played their best and\nmost enjoyable game of the season.\nIt started badly, however, with Guy's taking the lead very early on. A minute later Hanke headed in from O 'Kelly's free kick.\nGuy's scored from a rebound later on during one of their rare sorties\nup field. The IC equalise r that followed was surely the best goal of the\ngame; Hanke volleyed a loose ball from outside the area into the top\nright-hand corner giving the surprised keeper no chance whatsoever.\nIC snatched the initiative and went ahead when Porter knocked the\nball past the keeper after O 'Kelly had dazzled Harry (their fullback) with\nan ama sing run and sent in a viciously curving cross.\nJust before the interval the IC defence were outnumbered and a low\nhard shot made the score at half time, 3-3.\nThe second half began well with Rake and Hanke combining neatly\non the right wing and O 'Kelly popped in the fourth goal.\nGuy's started to apply the pressure and Marten, who had performed\nwell in an unaccustomed position was unlucky when the referee\n(otherwise perfect) pointed to the spot. Thankfully Veats saved\nmiraculously but the pressure was sustained.\nFull-backs Caffyn and Morris kept IC in the lead by making many\nheroic f ask fes, and overlapping usefully to make the extra man for the\nIC 2nd'S REACH FINAI ALMOST Last Saturday IC 2nd's played their cup semi-final against QMCII and\ntheir luck run out when they were beaten 2-1 after extra time. On the way\nto the match, spirits were high in anticipation of winning and of the\nensuing celebrations. After changing, Phil Niccolls cigars were\nceremoniously laid on the dressing room table for consumption by the\ngoal scorers after the game.\nThe conditions were ideal forthe game; a firm pitch and a fairly strong\ncross-wind giving no particular advantage to either team. IC lost the\ntoss and were soon under pressure from QM C with Al Betts producing\nthe best saves of his season and Neil Price having to clear off the line for\nthe third match in succession. However this early pressure paid off for\nQM C when following a very long throw in (to the 6-yard box!) Barry\nHatton was adjudged to have elbowed the QM C centre-forward in the\nback when challenging for the header. Despite polite protests from\nChris Beer mainly consisting of \" Oh no!, On no! etc.\" the penalty was\ngiven and Al Betts, although diving the right way, stood no chance of\nsaving the kick.\nFollowing this setback, IC played better football and instead of\npassing to their opponents so often, began to create good moves which\nproduced a few shots at goal. QM C missed a few easy chances of\nincreasing their lead with IC's defence still playing a bit shakily, but\nfollowing one of these misses IC scored their equalise r. Phil Niccolls\ncollected the ball in midfield and bolted a ball to Dave Higgs who beat\nthe two defenders to the ball and chipped the ball over the goalkeeper's head. The game consisted, until half time, of a series of attacks from\nboth sides with no more real chances being created by either side.\nIC played their best football of the match for the first 15 minutes of the\nsecond half. Alistair Lenzcner, being fed by balls from Adrian Clarke,\ncontinuously beat Q MC's full-back and, crossing the ball, creating\nchances for Dave Higgs and Paddy Leaney (substitute for John\nDemnitz). There were several goal mouth scrambles with Adrian Clarke\nhitting the crossbar, Phil Niccolls hitting the goalkeeper's \"legs and\nseveral balls being cleared off the line. After those frenzied fifteen\nminutes the game degenerated a bit with Q MC's 'smooth self centred'\ncentre-back and extremely beefy right-back doing 2 footed tackles on\nanything that moved, and N. Price trying to even up the casualties\ndonned his leather gloves to keep his 'delicate' hands warm, and kicked\nthe ball as hard as possible in the QM C midfield player's face.\nUnfortunately he only stopped playing for a couple of minutes.\nIC continued doing most of the attacking,and Alistair Lenczner\nremained cool after being vis cio us ly hacked down - in fact so cool that\nhe froze into the background for the rest of the game. Indeed the only\nevent at any mention from then on to full time was N.( Price's attempt to\ndo an 'overhead scissor's kick' which resulted in nothing but great\nembarrassment.\nWhen the full time whistle went, it was decided to play extra time,\nfifteen minutes each way, however the referee only played ten minutes\neach as we discovered having lost. Anyhow two minutes into extra time\nQM C were making a rare dangerous attack with Chris Beer and Neil\nPrice running back covering two forwards. Chris Beer, in clearing the\nball, kicked it straight at Neil Price's face, who, remembering what he\nhad done to the QM C player earlier in the game, put up his hands to\nprotect his face. In doing so he patted the ball down in the path of one of\nthe Q MC's forwards who then mis kicked the ball over Al Bett's head.\nThe ball hit the crossbar and went in the goal and Chris Beer summed\nthis up saying 'Oh, really'. IC now began desperate attacks with Clive\nWhiteside hitting roof of the net, but time had run out for IC with only ten\nminutes each way. IC were out, Neil Price had been let down by the rest\nof the team and is now seeking a transfer. IC trooped back to the\nchanging rooms, Phil Niccolls' cigars were unceremoniously crushed in\nthe ashtray, Barry Hatton re-applied his hairspray and donned his\nshades, Chris Beer disappeared for a sherry party and in his quaint\nBirmingham manner, Paul Barnet summed up'the day 'So near and yet\nso far'.\nTeam: - Betts, Barnet, Hatton, Beer, Price, Clarke, Niccolls, Whiteside,\nHiggs, Demnitz (Leaney), Lenczner.\nAl Betts Brother\nIC IST XI 6 V1 QM C7 FEB. IC IST XI8V2 GUYS HO SP.10 FEB. Last week saw IC gain two further wins in league games. This now\nputs them in a very strong posit ii on. second in the table to Bedford\nCollege. The only notable fact to be recorded is the scoring of the team's50 th league goal in Saturday's watch against Guvs.\nP.R.; busy midfield.\nThe danger relented and with Reeve'.s sensible influence as sweeper\nIC pushed forward and when Rowley chipped through for Hanke to\ncomplete his superb hat-trick, the result was beyond doubt.\nTeam: Veats, Caffyn, Morris, Reeve, Marten, Rowley, Rake, O 'Kelly,\nPorter, Hanke.\n\n"

This is why Iam trying to introduce driverless\nactivities like the 'New Horizon' thing I 've been plugging lately.\nTherefore this week's offering is\nfor activities we can organize in\nconjunction with the Imperial\nCollege Red Cross Detachment,\n( ICRC D). The ICRC D is in\ncontact with volunteer agencies\nthat are desperate for people to\nhelp in the local hospitals, (not in\nstrike breaking activities) assisting with the social welfare of\npatients, something the full time\nnursing staff just haven't the time\nto provide but of which they say,\nis just as important as the medical\nattention. If you help with some of\nthese activities, the range is wide,\nfrom hospital shops to bedside\nvisiting, then contact me or\npreferably Roger Serpell, of the\nICRC D who can put you in touch\nwith the relevant agency. Roger\ncan be contacted via internal\nmail (Aeronautics) or phone\ninternal 3707.\nThe reason Iam issuing these\npleas on behalf of the ICRC D is\nthat Roger has his hands full with\nthe first aid side, especially now as\nthey are on emergency stand-by,\nfor the London ambulance service\nand doesn't have time to organize\nthe welfare side. If anyone is keen\non this sort of thing, the ICRC D are looking for a group leader to\ntake on this administrative side of\nthe organization, the volunteer\nneed have no first aid experience\nbut will be given training if\ndesired. If you are interested\nplease contact Roger as soon as\npossible as this situation has been\ndragging on for some time now\nwhile the hospitals are crying out\nfor this help.\nDon't forget the ICCA G meeting this Monday, 12.30\npm.

    "content": "Brain Drain\nREFECTORY BOYCOTT\nThe Boycott was, on the whole, a great success. Thanks are due to all\nwho helped, particularly Andy and Chris who organised the alternative\nfood. A few students did eat in Southside on that day (mostly just the\nmoron element which every College suffers from who are determined to\ngo out of their way to oppose the views of the vast majority), but most\npeople who did turn up to eat soon realised that the alternative food was\nboth better and cheaper.\nAnd isn'ta strange coincidence that chicken dishes were served\nduring and on the day after the boycott?\nENTS DISCOS\nEnts had their first disco in the Lower Lounge last week after repairs to\nthe floor had been completed, and most people seemed to think it was a good idea to hold it in the same room as a bar. Unfortunately this will not\nbe able to be repeated for a few weeks for various reasons, but I hope\nthat this will become their regular room in the future. The numbers who\nattended last week seemed to easily compensate Ents for having to\nreduce their entry charge to 10 p(a condition upon which they were\nallowed to use the room).\nFIRE ALARM\nThere was a false fire alarm last week, which un fortuna st ely provoked\nlittle response from the occupants of the Union Building at the time.\nEveryone knows that the majority of five alarms in the Union are false\nones caused by some idiot pissed out of his head, but there only has to\nbe a real one once and someone is likely to die if they don't get out. So\nnext time it happens, shift your bloody arse s out of the place without me\nhaving to come and kick them!\nR.S. M.

I decided to pretend to be ill because I couldn't take the\nstresses of being President any longer. Which rather naturally\nbrings me on to the controversy surrounding Welfare Day.\nAbortion. A couple of people have commented about abortion, not\nliking the inference of the article that I wrote in FELIX in the Welfare\nsupplement. As Welfare Day was aimed at giving people information\nabout services available to them, I cannot see that there was anything\nwrong in the information contained in that article. Furthermore, for\nthose people interested in the Union policy on this issue I should point\nout that our Union supports the National Abortion Campaign and that\nevery woman should have the right to decide whether to terminate her\npregnancy. Both the so-called \"Positive Alternatives to Abortion\" Society and also a letter appearing in last week's FELIX, seem to be\nopposed to the concept of the woman deciding as to whether she wishes\nto continue a pregnancy. It would seem to me to be a personal right to\ndecide.\nRefectories. As you probably know, the Refectory boycott was an\noverwhelming success. I must thank Chris Fox and Andy Lewis for such\na marvellous job with the food, (everybody agreed that it was better\nthan the normal service) and they even managed to make a. \u00a35.12 and a half pence profit, (something like 5% of turnover). It looks like we may\nbe no nearer stopping the use of the regulator in the way in which it has\nbeen used in the past, i.e. food prices may continue to go up by the full\namount of the Financial Times Grocery price index. By now aUG M should have taken some more policy on this and I hope we'll be able to\nget a change of heart from college.\nThe Union is also very much concerned about offering constructive\nsuggestions for the Refectory management to consider. If you have any\nideas please come and see me and we will pass them on.\nSocial Functions. A letter in FELIX a couple of issues ago suggested\nthat there was too much clashing of social functions on the same night.\nAlthough there is some feeling that anybody who doesn't want to clash\ncan stop themselves from doing so we thought we might give a whirl to\na new idea and that is Annie (int. 2232) will keep a bookings book for\nany social functions, either in or outside College being organised by\nsomeone in College. So, if you don't want to clash you can ring up\nAnnie and ask her if she knows of anything on that date. This of course\nwill only work if everybody voluntarily decides to tell Annie the date of\ntheir functions.\nBicycles. Just to prove yet again that I really do read FELIX, there\nwas another letter a couple of weeks ago, about bicycles getting lost\naround College. Although I haven't had any time to look into College\narrangements for bicycles there is one small thing you can do to help\nstamp out bicycle stealing, i.e. that is register your bike with your local\npolice station. Apparently each bike has a frame number. If you live in Kensington I have obtained the appropriate forms and they are in the\nUnion Office, (with Annie).\nDon't forget that papers go up for sabbatical elections on Monday,\n19th February, and if you don't want to stand you can always come\nalong and join in the fun at Hustings on March8 th. Mary Attenborough\nMEL KINKIE\nSTRIKES AGAIN\nHello Students, are you sitting comfortably and listening out there?\nGood, then I 'll begin. Once upon a time there existed three bears who\nlived up in IC Union Office and disguised themselves as Union Officers.\nEvery week they used to dream of naked bodies and various forms ol\nbizzar e sex. They also used to write obscure articles for Fid. IX which\nwent like:\nSocial Colours\nI am now accepting nominations for social colours. Any member of\nthe Union can nominate anybody for absolutely anything - and all\nnominations are judged by a colours committee which awards colours\nto people who have made a significant contribution to the non academic life of the Union. So let's be having your nominations.\nClosing date for nominations: March16 th. Insurance\nIf you've got a musical instrument, I received today some hump h from people who specialise in insuring instruments for students (so it\nseems). So if you've got a good organ - come up and see me about it.\nMike The Elk ICU Hon. Sec.\n\n"

Opsoc's latest annual light opera\noffering, 'The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein' is really pulling in the\nmasses. Or at least, this production deserves to. Still, you have\ntonight and tomorrow left, so I 'll give you some idea of what you are in\nfor.\nOpsoc, in the person of Ian Gledhill (Producer) have resurrected this\nonce most popular work by Jacques Offenbach ('Can-Can' to peasants\nlike you and me) in a fresh and entertaining manner. The plot is\nsupposedly a satire on German militarism and chronicles the fortunes of\nFritz, a private soldier, admirably played and sung by...(rustle, rustle,\nsearch through programme)... Terence Newcombe. Fritz is a good ole\ndown-to-earth bod who stones plenty of crows and raves about his\nmagic Wanda(Delith Brook). She raves about him and so all is\nsweetness and light- until the Duchess( a fine performance by Deborah\nJohns on) shows up. The Duchess being a well brought up and sheltered girl naturally has fantasies about whatever is inside a uniform,\nespecially if they are clean wholesome and stone crows. Inevitably,\nFritz becomes the latest pet and rockets to Commander-in-Chief of the\nDvichess's Army, much to the dismay of the current incumbent. The Duchess's affection for Fritz does not endear him to her current suitor,\nthe rather wet Prince Paul (Tim Johnson) or the Duchy's Chamberlain\nBaron Puck(Steve Chaytow) who, along with the ex C inC, General\nBoum(Richard Stockton), cobble together and prescribe a treatment of\nblood-letting, preferably Fritz's. To amputate a convoluted plot, Fritz falls the way he rose when the\nDuchess discovers that he prefers Wanda's ravings to those of her own.\nAll inevitably ends happily with Fritz and Wanda paired off to produce\nmore soldiers for the Army, and Prince Paul drying out and no longer\nlooking delicate ten feet in front of the Duchess.\n'The Duchess of Gerolstein' is assuredly a 'sparkling and tuneful' work,\nvery popular in the second half of last century. However, this century it\nhas somewhat fallen from grace - only being recently revived\nprofessionally. Ian Gledhill suggests that'the subject matter - a satire on\nGerman militarism was hardly appropriate after the rig ours of two world wars.'\nThe Opsoc production includes a new version of the Third Act,\nmostly reworked by the Producer. The original opera included a bedroom scene in the Third Act but this was e razed from the D' Oyly Carte Production in1897.To return to the original score meant\nrestoring a bedroom scene- hence the reworking.\nAs usual the Opsoc stalwarts were in fine voice - items I particular i ly enjoyed were the ' Duty' duet between Fritz and Wanda and the Sabre\nroutine.Acting generally seems to have improved on previous years'\nperformances - characters appeared less wooden than usual; one\nexample - I have not seen anyone look as angry as Delith Brook.\nChoreography of Opsoc productions is a perennial problem - more\nthan half a dozen people dancing on the Concert Hall stage at one time\nbears more resemblance to the Shed when Chelsea manage a no-score\ndraw than musical entertainment. However there is no solution save\nfinding an improved stage. While restricted to such economy of space,\nthough, Opsoc soldier on exceedingly well.\nNEW MEMBERS REQUIRED FOR EASTER SHOW 'Trial by Jury'\nby' Gilbert and Sullivan AND FOR OPSOC'S SUMMER TOUR IN\nBUD LEIGH SALTER TON, DEVON FOR MORE INFORMATION CONTACT JANE TURNER, CIV. ENG.( Int.3280)\nPrince Paul (Tim Johnson) drinks from the green and gold cup in the final scene of\nThe Grand Duchess of Gerolstein.\nTICKETS STILL AVAILABLE\nfor\n'The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein\nTONIGHT AND TOMORROW Union Concert Hall,7.15 pm Contact Union Office or Alan Crewe (Met.II) for details\nS ome things I always enjoy about Opsoe product ions.

The energy and creativity is there and I use it. No problem!\"\nWould you believe that this can be j achieved by a simple natural mental '\u2022\ntechnique, which can be easily learnt by\nanyone, in a few minutes? Transcendental\nmeditation ( TM) is a systematic procedure,\npractised for 15-20 minutes twice daily,\nsitting comfortably, with the eyes closed. The\nTM tech ni qi\" allows the mind to settle down\nto a less excited state. The person experiences\nquieter and quieter levels of thinking till he or\nshe arrives at a state of complete mental\nstillness. In this state the attention is said to\nhave gone beyond, or transcended, the\neveryday level of thought - hence the\ndescription 'Transcendental Meditation'. It\nrequires no changes in diet, philosophical\noutlook, or life-style. Nor does it involve (\nescape or withdrawal from life - on the1 contrary, its purpose is to make activity\nmore dynamic and enjoyable.\nIt all sounds a little far fetched, doesn't it?\nPerhaps, but can you be sure?\nWhatever our reaction to Maharishi\nMahesh Yogi, the Himalayan sage, who\nintroduced TM to the World in 1958, over 2\nmillion people, in all walks of life, have learnt\nthis technique. With about 92,000 med it at or s in England, and around 1,500 learning per\nmonth. TM is being used extensively in many\ndifferent fields: education, business, med-i cine, governmental and even military\nprogrammes all over the World. Kaiser\nAluminium Company, the U.S. Army,\nStrategic Air Command, scientists at\nHouston Space Centre, the Illinois House of\nRepresentatives, Canadian Civil Service,\nand the U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and\nWelfare and many 'big name' academics\nhave thrown their weight behind TM. Over\n600 research studies at major universities in\nEurope and the States, have shown reu lts are\nnot only subjective but can be objectively\nverified.\nWell just what are the benefits?\nIncreased Intelligence growth rate!\nIntelligence measured as I.Q. has hitherto\nbeen thought to reach its peak in the late\nteens and then remain constant or even\ndecrease. Students practising TM regularly\nwere found to show a greater increase in\nintelligence than among control students.\nOther benefits such as clear thinking,\nimproved concentration, memory, iri crea sed well-being and reduced anxiety-have all been measured at scientific research\ncentres all over the world. As any student\nknows, learning ability depends on the state\nof mind. A dull mind comprehends little, but\na clear alert mind results in maxim ising learning ability.\nThe practice of TM produces a deep level\nof rest and relaxation, releasing stress and\nfatigue from the nervous system, and\nresulting in a general improvement of health.\nOver 100 medical practitioners in England\nhave written to the Dept. of Health and\nSocial Security suggesting that TM should be\non the National Health Service and in the\nUSA,14% of professional baseball and\nfootball players have taken up TM to\nimprove their game.\nWith a clearer mind and a fresher body,\nmed it at or s found social behaviour becomes\nmore harmonious; friendships become\ndeeper and easier to make. As TM dissolves\ntensions and fatigue we have more of\neverything, including energy, to live life to\nthe full and give more to everyone.\nOn the level of society, studies have shown\nthat as little as 1% of med it at or s in a community is enough to reduce negative\ntendencies to a measurable extents e.g. road\naccidents, hospital admissions and crime\nrates have been reduced by, on average, 17%\ncompared to control cities, where the crime\nrate was still increasing at the national\naverage.\nA society consists of a collection of\nindividuals. The increase of coherence and\norderliness found in individual life will be\nreflected in society. Even in Britain, suffering\nfrom strikes and social turbulence, if a sufficient number of people begin to practise\nthe TM and TM sid hi( more advanced\ntechniques) programme.\nI.C.T. M. Soc., was started to tell as many\npeople as possible about T.M. Here in IC in\nthe last 10 years hundreds of students and\nstaff have learnt T.M. In the T.M. Soc. we have regular talks\nabout the technique, meetings, discussions,\nparties, outings, and plenty of opportunity\nfor meeting people.\nThe next and last introductory talk this\nterm will be held in Mech. Eng. 664 at 5.30\npm on Monday 19th February and will\nlast about 45 minutes. Those interested (and\nthose sceptical etc!') please come along and\nfind out more or come just to eat and drink\nthe free tea and biscuits.\nJon Rees\nIC TM Soc.\nWATER POLO On Thursday 8th our 1st team played a game in the U.L. U. league against university\ncollege.\nIC started off very well with hard play, this\nenabled Steve Taylor to score with a very well\nplaced lob shot. U.C. pushed back, but close\nmarking thwarted their attempts and with a fast turn in play Steve was able to score\nanother goal. U.C. broke back and put in a good goal. Play went backwards and forward\nuntil Philip Mills scored a goal with a hard\nshot from the right wing. In the second\nquarter U.C. with a few substitute changes\nstarted a concerted attack and scored two\ngoals, Steve scored his third goal with\nanother lob and then U.C. broke back to make\nthe score 4-4. In the third quarter Steve\nscored another goal and Dave Dunstone\nscored a goal from very close in. U.C. however also managed to score three goals.\nThe final quarter showed up our weakness\nwith U.C. scoring another couple of goals and\nSteve scoring our final goal, making the final\nscore 7-9.\nUrania's Sauai\npart pj..\nIN sef ffc HorA COMMUNICATIONS CENTRE/' k6 USS FUU*0 Mf tWA J \u00a3 \" MV ft C RHkGfiKttON \\S: COURSE- - AND T^M PTI X Loses, w<& WAY AGAIN..\nWoU SA\\b^ fbu,\njk MEW How 16\n(Fcf THrS -TH1U6I\nI CAN D(2AK e,Ai^ RfcUNcj, 60TA LW'r f tose UTTI-\u00a3^T4\u00a3\u00a3\nCTHGRC.THeEC DA&UNC,)!\nATTENTION I WHILE\n4.0U LOT WERE\n\u2022PRfrTTlNG RW3UNU\nI FOL1NJD THE\nPLRNET MH5ELF.\nWE RRE NDU1 IN\n\u00a33EQ5 TR Ti OMH R4 OWP\nRfiUVE THE CONTINENT\nWHERE THE FeDeKflT10fi<\nV AND JON'T CALL ME \"DA^UNQ\" \u2014IT'S lft MY v JAY| So WHAT If WE\n6AT>f tR PtSUPU^ElJtoRE UST?WWfflErSHE _\nnR&ie aims wt of 'ro^4: OM HUN1, Z RT IONS NftKgAk\u00a3,siR,f&k K6%u\\m6 n5 fT IS\nUPPfl5\u00a3D pa\n\n"

    "content": "Issue No.509 Friday. 16th February. 1979\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCzernuszka proposing Northern\nU GM REPORT LOBBY OF GOVERNORS TODAY\nIC students are to lobby College Governors today in abid to\nchange the use of the regulator in refectory price fixing and to\nmaintain the right of Refectory Committee to decide all food\nprices.\nThe decision to lobby the Finance and Executive Meeting at\n170 Queens Gate from10.00 am today was taken at a well-attended IC Union Meeting on Tuesday this week after Union President Mary Attenborough hinted that students might\nshortly face a5 per cent food price increase.\nThe Meeting also empowered the Union Executive to organise a24 hour boycott of all student refectories if the lobby fails to achieve its\naims. After the response to last week's Southside boycott students were\nconfident that a general boycott call would be obeyed, and defeated an\namendment to limit action to one refectory only. No date was fixed for\nthe boycott.\nHOUSING A motion calling for a full-time\nUnion staff member to deal with\nthe housing problems of IC students was passed by the\nMeeting. The College will be\nasked to provide extra cash for\nthis post.\nProposed by External Affairs\nOfficer Sheyne Lucock, the\nmotion also called for the closing\nof loop holes in the Rent Act,\nsecurity of tenure for all residential occupiers, compulsory\npurchase of empty property, and the use of short-life property for\nstudent housing.\nThe Union resolved to\ncontinue its efforts to house its\nown students and to campaign for\nFOOD PRICING THREAT\nA proposal submitted by the Rector to the Finance and Executive\nCommittees on 16th February, if passed, could remove from the\nRefectory Committee all decisions concerning refectory food pricing.\nThe proposal, which appeared under item 5 (Finances of Refectories:\nUse of the Regulator) states:\n'In the Rector's view, moreover, It Is Inappropriate for the Refectory\nCommittee Itself, whose membership consists largely of consumers, to\nbe Involved In decisions of this kind and the best arrangement Is tor the\nregulator and the termly adjustments, If any, to be applied by the\nDomestic Secretary In consultation with the Chairman, Refectory\nCommittee. He would, however, himself wish to be consulted about any\nproposed termly adjustments, and, before author ising action, would\npropose always to consult the President ICU and, where desirable,\nother appropriate persons.'\nAt the moment, Refectory Committee, which has six voting student\nmembers, can discuss the financing of the refectories. If this proposal is\nimplemented, though, prices could be increased, without reference to\nthe Committee, by the Domestic Secretary (Capt. J WG Lindley) and the\nChairman (Prof. S. Eilon) simply by applying the regulator. ICU need\nnot be informed of such increases which would necessitate the Union\nhaving to monitor prices continually and comparing them with the FT\nGrocery Index.\nAlthough the Rector and the Union President would be consulted\nshould a termly review occur, there is no guarantee that such a review\nwould ever take place.\nIn an attempt to prevent this proposal being accepted, and to protest\nat the past use of the regular, ICU decided to hold a lobby of the\ngovernors attending today's Fan dE meeting (see-UGM report). It is vital\nthat this lobby is well-attended or else IC students may lose what little\nsay they have in the pricing of refectory food.\nchanges in housing law and\nincreased housing provision.\nA Union byelaw change\noutlining a method of dismissing a departmental representative was\ngiven a first reading. This would\nallow a meeting of 15 per cent of\nthe students in a department to\ndismiss their representative.\nIRELAND Lengthy and heated discussion\non a motion dealing with the\nproblems of Northern Ireland\ntook place resulting in the passing\nof policy unrelated to the terms of\nJan Czernuszka's motion.\nThe original motion stated that\n\" Ireland is one nation\", condemned the British \"colonial\nforce of occupation\" and called\nfor a \"total withdrawal of British\nImperialism from Ireland \".\nRCS President Chris Fox and\nIrish woman Liz Lindsay proposed an amendment saying\nthat Northern Ireland is part of\nthe United Kingdom, that the\nGovernment has a duty to\nmaintain law and order, and that\nmembers of terrorist groups are\ncriminals and do not deserve\npolitical status.\nDespite an animated and\nimpassioned speech against the\namendment by another Irish\nstudent, Des McL ern on, it was\npassed after several contributions\nfrom both Irish and British\nstudents.\nAn attempt by Mary Attenborough to change the\nmotion yet again was defeated\nand Chris Fox's proposals became\nUnion policy.\nThe Meeting was unable to\ndiscuss two further controversial\nmotions on the legal is ation of\ncannabis and on gay rights before\njit was adjourned at 2.30 p.m. "

    "content": "REVIEWS!\nNot many people know this but last month\nGenesis played a low-key London concert for\nthe benefit of Spanish an arc is ts. Mr. Genesis\nP. Orridge is a member of a wonderful little\ngroup called Throbbing Gristle.\nRecently the music press has printed much\nintellectual rubbish about T.G. so here, if\nyou're interested, is what they are really like.\nT.G. consist of Genesis on violin, bass,\nvocals (?) and effects; Cosey Fanni Tutti on\nguitar mutilation; Peter Christopherson\n(sleazy) on tapes, electronics, radio and\ndigital clock; and Chris Carter on T.V. tapes\nand electronics. Quite a selection and you\nshould hear them play them.\nT.G. say they play 'Industrial music for\nIndustrial people' and this only takes place a few times a year so every period of\nindustrialisation is different and eagerly\nanticipated.\nThis particular exhibition took place in a freezing deserted old school and started with\na film 'After Cease to Exist' for which T.G. provided the eerie soundtrack. Its main\ntheme seemed to be castration and was a bit\ndifferent to say the least. Throughout, T.G. had just sat on stage watching and chatting.\nThey then decided to start the demonstration\nunannounced, Gen started the occasional\nstrumming, Cosey plucked the odd string,\nstill sitting down and wearing her coat. Chris\nand Peter with their backs to everyone began\nto play with the radio and TV. and the\nelectronic clock was started.\nThe first piece lasted a few minutes, then\nthere was another, then Genesis went to the\nmicrophone for a while, I saw his lips move\nand a sound came out of the speakers.\nT.G. have released two albums and a hit\nsingle. I don't think they played anything from\nany of them, and if they had no-one would\nhave recognised it as everything was\ndeliberately low-fi with plenty of echo and\ndistortion.\nEverything seemed pure in pro visa tion; noone clapped, T.G. would have been offended\nif anyone had wanted to; no-one danced, the\nodd poseur tried and failed. Mouths were\nopen, eyes just observed, occasionally a muscle twitched as some random rhythm was\nnoted.\nA few more pieces passed, a few more\nvocals, even a disco track, then they'd finished all they wanted to play and the clock\nshowed 57 minutes. But a normal rock\nconcert lasts one hour so the show must go\non. All implements were turned to full and\ntortured to produce the most mind blowing\nwhite noise ever experienced.\nThen exactly one hour after they'd started\nthey stopped, again to rap tuo us non-applause and apathy. A tape of Abba was\nCONCERTS played over the P.A. and everyone instinctively headed for the door back to their\neveryday mundane lives.\nBut wait! Genesis is at the mike again and\nyou can even hear what he's saying, \"Some\npeople missed the film so if you want we'll\nshow It again.\" Thank-you T.G. but not today\nplease.\nThrobbing Gristle are unique in ova tors and\ninfiltrators in rock and make everyone else at\nwork in the medium look obsolete. If you've\nbeen to some concerts go to see T.G. for the\nultimate rock gig, let's just hope that fame\ndoesn't finish them.\nI'm still not sure if I enjoyed the experience\nyet. Maybe I 'll find out before I die or maybe I won't. That's all.\nPeter S. Mash\n(How about it Ents?)\nPunishment of Luxury are a Newcastle\nband formed in late 7 7 and have, already\nacquired cult status in London, being almost\nevery music critic's darlings. One of the first\npeople who recognised their potential was\ndear old John Peel himself who invited them\non his show when they were still non-entities.\n(This is how I became acquainted with the\nband-dashing out next day to catch them live\nat the White Hart pub, Acton, where they gave\na devastating performance).\nPunilux are: Brian Bond (vocals), Jimmy\nGiro( bass). Nevil Luxury( guitar) MaLacabella (guitar) and Jeff Thwaite\n(drums) and play powerful rock augmented\nby a subtle but extremely effective use of\nthe at ric s. Their live rendition of their single\n\"Puppet Life\" is astonishing; no dry ice, no\nlasers, no back projections, no lights - a bit of\nchoreography, mime & genuine emotion/or\ncalculated lack of it make up for the multi-million dollar presentations of the \"name\ngroups\".\nPunilux have recently signed with United\nArtists and their first album is in the making-world beware! Catch them in the intimate\natmosphere of IC's Concert Hall, next\nSunday, February 18th in a few months you\nmight be queuing outside the Rainbow or the\nHammersmith Odeon to see them.\nJ. Malathronas\nEnts Ass. Publicity Officer\n\"The Changeling\" by Thomas Middleton\nand at the Aldwych Theatre (Royal William\nRowley Shakespeare Company).\nThe play, written in 1622, is one of the\nbetter known of its era. Even by modern\nstandards, it has all the right ingredients;\nhumour, tragedy, lust, revenge, murder and a cataclysmic finish.\nIt is set in Alicante, and I assume the date is\nsupposed to be contemporary with respect to\nthe time of writing.\nThe matter of the play concerns the\nchanges in fortune experienced by certain\nindividuals in inversely parallel situations,\nand the ultimate balance attained.\nThe production is impressive, with strange\nlighting arrangements which change the\natmosphere from complacency to stark terror\nin seconds, music (directed by Gordon\nKember) which is equally versatile, and a powerful sense of visual metaphor throughout which has become one of the\ntrademarks of the R.S.C. The stage has an\noff world look to it, and at times it seems as if\nthe play is set inside a glowing furnace,\nparticularly in the opening sequence, when\nthe players process along the stage, some\nwith masks, serving to give an impression of\ncursed misery, one and all moving like\npuppets, tied by the cutting threads of terrible\nfate. Cheerful? The rest of the play is\ncompletely overpowering, but with the\noccasional break for humour to allow one a gasp for breath, even then the humour has\nsinister or ironic overtones.\nThe criticism which could well be raised\nabove all this is as to whether the play itself\nmerits such a stunning production. I believe\nso, because the director (Terry Hands) has to\nproduce the play to its best advantage, and\nMiddleton and Rowley, whilst being exceptional a times, do not possess the wit,\ncontinuity or consistency of Shakespeare. I do not believe that a play is overproduced\nunless it actually detracts from that which the\nauthor has written, and in \"The Chang ling\" the converse is true.\nDiana Quick played the part of Beatrice, the\nparagon of virtue who fell into wickedness\nand vice. If actors and actresses really do\nbecome the part they play when on stage, I'm surprised she survived the first week. She\nportrayed such tragedy and inspired such\npity that at times one was struck senseless.\nEmrys James, an actor whose work I have\nalways admired, was as well suited to-the role\nof De Flores, the wretched servant and\naccomplice to Beatrice as any could have\nbeen.\nThe fools inthe madhouse were well played\ntoo, and their keeper Loilio (Barrie Rutter)\nwas exceptional.\nAll in all. this is a rivetting production and\nvery well worth seeing.\nDEBATING SOCIETY\nThe li rst in as cries of mini-debates was held in Me chEng lecture theatre ' J'. The motion proposed by Mr Berry was that the house did not\nbelieve in proportional representation. His long and\nintricate speech outlined how\ndisastrous such a system would be\nfor the democracy of this country\nand how it could lead to the total\ndestruction of our civilization.\nThis motion was immediately\nfollowed by a vigorous defence of\nproportional representation by\nMr. Hunt bach who quoted many\ncases where such a system seems to\nbe successful and gave statistics to\nsupport his argument.\nThe voting heralded the end of\nexhaustive discussion from the\nfloor with Mi. Berry having to\nanswer more than his fair share of\nquestions.\nThe result of the show of hands\nwas a60% support for the motion.\nAt the next mini-debate on the\n2 2 nd of February in Me chEng340 the motion will be, \" This House defends the Right of Every\nStudent to Remain Aloof From The Activities of Their Student\nUnion.\" The speakers include\nChris Fox and Bernard Smith so it\npromises to be a great success.\nJohn Shuttleworth Publicity Officer GO CLUB\nFollowing the successful tournaments held at the end of\nterm, Go Club is holding another\nHandicap tournament on Sunday\nthe 18th of February in Southside\nUpper Lounge (i.e. this Sunday)\nstarting at about 2 30 p.m. The tournament will have 3\nrounds and free refreshments\nwill be available to those who\nenter.\nThe entrance fee (all of which\ngoes into the prize fund) is 25 p.

    "content": "I CROSS COUNTRY\nTEDDY HALL RELAY\nLacking for suitably tough competition\nnearer home, our runners have been forced to\nventure further afield to exercise their legs.\nSt. Edmund Hall, Oxford, were hosts for a4 x3 mile relay. The site of the first 4 minute mile\ndid not inspire an absentee-weakened team,\nkeeping us out of the medals, these being\ntaken by Bristol, Leicester (2nd and 4th) and\nBeading. The former won in 65 minutes,\nalmost 3 minutes ahead of our A team. Ian\nMorton led off, showing well in 5th position\nalong the river, but failing under a late-onset\nhangover, handing over in 10th to Bryan\nAcford who streaked round in our fastest time of the day to gain four places, eyes set\nintently on matching a female acquaintance\nstill finishing the first leg. The short legs of\nDave Rowson, happy on home ground, could\nnot however cope with the impromptu steeple\nchase over VII Is left straddling the towpath,\npassing baton in 7th place to Mick Pickard\nwho held position, striding out over a final\nstraight of 90% puddle to maintain a creditable 7th place.\nWay back in 31st, and last, position, the two\nman Jesus College team encouraged each\nother on this final quarter mile splash with\ncries of \"Come on Jesus, walk on water\".\nThey paid for their blasphemy.\nMeanwhile, a vendetta motivated Gary\nLonghurst was running hard to place the B team in 21st after the first leg, with Geoff\nSherwood recovering from being overtaken\nby a middle-aged jogger to gain a place but\nthen lose it again, retching under the strain of\na sprint finish and a college pork pie. Nick\nBullock raised us3 places, demonstrating our\nstrength in depth, which depth abruptly\nended with a borrowed Oxford and England\noriente er gliding us up to a final 13th position.\nThis was still too low to avoid a shower queue\nin changing rooms boasting a dry-ice heated\nstone floor.\nG. Sherwood\nLast Saturday the 1979 Southern England\nX country championships were held at\nParliament Hill fields and Hampstead Heath.\nNorth London, and some of the Club were\npresent to compete in the Junior Men's and\nSenior men's races.\nAfter making use of the luxurious changing\nfacilities and trying to get filmed by the be eb, which seemed to depend on whether or not\nyou were swearing about the complete lack of\nchanging facilities as prompted by the Sound\nRecordist. We were then ready for the start of\nthe Junior race which consisted of 2 laps of\nthe 3 mile circuit and proved to be very\nheavy going.1\nIn this race Ian Morton ran\nwell to finish 82nd and Gary Longhurst came\n129th. After the Junior race the main race of the\nafternoon the Senior Men's race was then\nheld. This race was of 9 miles duration\nconsisting of 3 laps of the circuit and was of a very high standard, being contested by\nAthletic Clubs from all over the South of\nEngland.\nThe First IC runner to finish was Mark\n.Pickard in 256th, who had opted to run in the\nSenior although he was still a Junior, he was\nfollowed home by Brian Acford in 2P2 nd, closely followed by Dave Rosen in 348*' \u2022 with\nGeoff Sherwood coming 396th. Mick Kelly\nwas also present and helped with the\ncollecting of numbers and recording the\nscores.\nI ORIENTEERING\nThe Orienteering Club made its weekly excursion out of town on Sunday, this time to pastures new, pleasant and very fast under boot, by the name of Worth Forest which sits at the far end of theM23. The day's best run was by club captain\nAndy Quickfall, running well to win the\n\" Mean B\" class by a margin of seven-and-a half minutes. Club stalwarts David Rosen\nand Steve Kirk finished within seconds of\neach other in 7th and8 th places in the \" Men A\" class, and Ken Warren, having won his\nweekly battle, getting out of bed in time,\ndawdled round to finish 11th in the \" Men19 III. C.IV HONG KONG S.C.( Away) 6-3\nThe feature of this match, quite apart from\nthe six excellent wins achieved by Kumar and\nLakhani, was the bat-smashing Jeff Stean\n(3rd team captain and voyeur) debacle - a two-piece bat is no excuse for losing three\ngames (I do it with a one-piece bat).\nI.C. II V DEPT.OF.EMP.III (away) 6-3\nThe winning run of the seconds was\ncontinued here, despite all three players\nlosing to the D of E number one (who was\nbeaten by a certain fourth team player not\nlong ago).\nThe match was very close with both Tyre\nand Sobhampanak having match points\nagainst them before finally winning in three\ngames.\n' '' ~\nSOUTHAMPTON AMAZED Last Saturday, the Captain of Southampton University Tenpin Bowling team was amazed when London succeeded in fielding four full teams, including a full ladies team, for the first time in two years. His amazement turned to worry when two-thirds of his team failed to arrive by roll-ofi;\nwith about ten minutes to go before London\nwere entitled to claim a walkover in the first\ngame, the rest of the away team arrived,\nrushed onto the lanes, and proceeded to take\nthe upper hand. Although the London2 nd and 3rd teams found some consistency in the\nsecond game, both were only level on points\nwith Southampton after this stage.\nMeanwhile the 1st team looked set for its\nfirst defeat of the year.

    "content": "Page 18,\nAFTER THE BOYCOTT There can no longer be any doubt that students are dissatisfied with\nthe refectory service at this college.\nThat is the view of IC Union Executive members and several Union\nOfficers after last week's24 hour boycott call was followed by almost\nthe entire student body.\nFor much of the day's meal times the refectory was empty save a few\nlonely eaters who had defied the pickets. Refectory staff stood huddled\naround the service counter de moral is ed and watched the pickets\nturning away customers at the entrance.\nOnly 45 meals were served in Southside student refectory on\nThursday: 8 breakfasts, 27 lunches and 10 evening meals. In Linstead\nHall, where the evening meal is brought from the Southside kitchens,\nonly 24 of the 120 residents ate in hall after the Union had asked them to\nsign out in support of the boycott.\nRefecto.'y Committee Chairman Professor Eilon is not, however,\nconvinced that there is widespread dissatisfaction. In his view students\nobeyed the boycott call purely out of loyalty to the Union and because\nof the presence of pickets on the door. He pointed out that the boycott\nleaflet had told students to stay away from Southside even if they were\nsatisfied with some meals.\nI saw several people being turned away by the pickets. And the\nUnion's alternative food service, which provided about 120 lunches,\ncertainly influenced many.\nBut Union Secretary Mike Elkin told FELIX that it was mainly staff who\nneeded persuading not to eat in Southside and that many students\nmade no attempt even to approach the picket line.\nAnd Barry Austin, proposer of the boycott motion at the Union\nmeeting, said that he visited Southside refectory the next day and\npeople had told him that they had taken part in the boycott because they\nagreed with its aims.\nThe Union alleges that the quality of food is poor, prices are too high\nand inflation price increases are too great. The boycott was called to\nprotest at all these.\nBut refectory staff were confused over the students' aims and many\ntook the boycott as a personal attack on their work. They did not\nunderstand why Southside should have been singled out and had\nexpected\" the boycott to be called off after the abandoning of a threatened price increase in January.\nThe Southside Supervisor said she had seen many students eating in\nthe refectory for three years, which did not indicate widespread\ndissatisfaction. Complaints were usually only about food not being hot\nenough and staff said that if a student made a genuine complaint about\na meal it was always exchanged.\nStaff had prepared food for about 200 at lunchtime and said that the\nmeals would be wasted.\nCatering Manager Victor Mooney, whose name is synonymous with\nCollege food, told FELIX that the meals would not be served again the\nnext day. He said that his thoughts about the boycott would be\nunprintable. Such action could only result in further cuts in services and\nunemployment of refectory staff.\nHe recalled the far greater choice of refectories available to IC\nstudents in the late 60s and claimed that boycott action in 1969-70 had\nbrought services down to their present level.\nHe said that the cheap restaurants had an easier task than he as they\nwere open all day and 52 weeks a year. He was providing a service\ntaylor ed to the needs of IC students. This was the only London College\nserving meals at weekends, he claimed.\nAs if the boycott itself was not enough, when the refectory closed 20\nminutes early at lunch time due to lack of customers, Paul Davies, one of\nthe pickets, led a group of students to sign the complaints' book in\nprotest at the early closing.\nWhat the boycott has achieved remains to be seen. Professor Eilon, in\na statement reprinted elsewhere in FELIX, says that such action can\nonly undermine the financial position of the refectories and that the\nburden will fall on the customers. The food was not perfect but\nimprovements were being made.\nUnion Officers however consider the action very successful and say\nthat the College must now take note of students' feelings.\nDOWNSTAIRS RECORDS & TAPES BOUGHT\nSOLD & EXCHANGED\nBEST PRICES PAID\n\u2022\nSHADY'S RECORD LIBRARY\n\u2022\nBIG DISCOUNTS ON SELECTED\nLP's PLUS A GOOD\nSELECTION OF CUT-OUTS\n& OVER-RUNS\n\u2022\nPOSTERS, BADGES\n& COLLECTOR'S SINGLES\nMUSIC MARKET\nINCORPORATING\n\" SHADY DEALS\"20 HIGH STREET, PUTNEY, LONDON, SW15\nNEW RELEASE& CHART SINGLES ONLY70 p LARGE SELECTION OF IMPORT LP's,7\"&12\" SINGLES1000 s OF GOLDEN OLDIE SINGLES INC.

    "content": "Page 8\nA STATEMENT\nby Ms. M. Attenborough,\nPresident of Imperial College Union\nThe statement issued by Professor Eilon claims that our Refectory\nboycott was not a useful action. However, it was very largely Professor\nEllon's uncooperative attitude in refusing to believe that there was large\nscale dissatisfaction existing with the refectories which forced us to\nhold a boycott.\nIt is not true to say that we have not attempted to put forward\ncomplaints and suggestions to the Refectory committee. Representatives of the Union sit on the Complaints and Suggestions\nsub-committee of the Refectory committee and have constantly\nexpressed a wide-scale dissatisfaction. Also, the Union's Permanent\nWorking Party prepared a report for Captain Lindley after he suggested\nthat he was unaware of those aspects that people were dissatisfied with\nin the refectories. However, it seems strange that the Refectory\nmanagement should turn solely to the Student Union in order to\ndiscover the dissatisfaction with the service provided and in order to\nfind what .improvements should be carried out. Surely it is the job of the\nmanagement to constantly explore such dissatisfaction and to carry out\ntheir own investigation. The Student Union, after all, is very much\noverworked and has a whole number of areas of concern to students\nthat it has to do work on. The boycott was also held to show the large scale dissatisfaction with\nCollege's pricing policy and at this point in time, the use of the\nregulator. Two price increases have occurred during the last three\nmonths, totalling 3.3%, and more, it appears, are now on the way. While\non the subject of prices the leaflet distributed by the pickets on\nThursday listed alternative places to eat at \"comparable prices\". The\nleaflet was not intended to advise people to eat outside the College on a regular basis. We believe that it is better to improve the service at\nreasonable prices given by the refectory at College in order to give a better seri vce to everybody. This is one of the terms of the Refectory\nClub's own constitution. A boycott is merely a way of making a point\nagainst current policy and it is hoped that by taking heed of our\nsuggestions and the feelings of the College something positive will be\ndone which will, in the long term, increase trade to the refectories.\nI went to great pains to explain to Southside refectory staff that our\naction was not aimed at them. I would certainly hope that the good\nrelations that do exist between students and those people that work in\nthe refectories will continue.\nI therefore appeal to all of the Refectory management, to the\nRefectory Committee and to the Rector to show good sense. The food\nand service are, of course, not perfect. More can be done, however to\nachieve popular prices and get better quality to suit the majority of\nrefectory customers. To constantly up prices on the basis that small\nincreases will not be noticed by most people is, in fact, my definition of\ncomplacency. We are the customers and we are calling for action now to\nimprove quality and stop the vicious and blanket price increases as they\ndo nothing but damage.\nMary Attenborough\nPGTipsMost postgraduate research students have not completed their\ndegrees three years after registering at Imperial College and half have\nnot finished after four years.\nThese disturbing facts come from figures made available to the\nCollege's Board of Studies last week and indicate that all is not well\nregarding postgraduate research at IC.\nThe statistics cover students who entered College in 1974-5 and in\n1975-6, and state the position as at October 1978.\nOf 237 students admitted for research in 1974-5 only 118 (49.9 per\ncent) had been awarded a higher degree. 9.3 per cent had withdrawn,\n13.0 per cent were still at College, 27.4 per cent had left College but were\nstill registered, and 0.4 per cent (one student) had failed.\nThese students had been The statistics show that very few\nregistered for Ph.D, MPhil, DIC or achieve this.

PG Affairs Officer\nA Lobby a Day Keeps the Fees Away\nPerhaps I'd better start by explaining exactly what it is we're\nafter, and how much it will cost the College. As you may know,\nthe Government requires the College to supplement its income\nby charging each student a fee for tuition, and at present,\noverseas students are charged more than home students for\nthe same education. The Government has announced that\ntuition fees should be increased for next session supposedly to\nkeep in lime with inflation. What we are trying to do, therefore,\nis to persuade College not to implement any increase, thus\ndefying the Government, as Bradford University once did. The purpose of all this, ultimately, is to change Government policy,\nwhich is where the lobby of MPs comes in.\nIf you take the difference between the income the College would receive\nfrom increased fees, and the income they would receive by keeping fees\ndown and charging overseas students the same as home students, then\nthis comes to just over \u00a3400,000. So, effectively we're asking the College\nto do without that amount of money next year - which is going to take\nquite a bit doing.\nThat's why we've organised a campaign on the scale we have, as was\nreported in FELIX last week.\nThe most important thing you can do is help with the LOBBY A DAY and the SPEAK IN, which are both designed to draw the\nattention of the media to our campaign. Lobbying your MP at the\nHouse of Commons need n't take longer than about 20 minutes, and if\nyou've never been inside the House before, then it's quilt: a worthwhile\nexperience. (We provide you with a briefing sheet and a list of simple\nquestions to ask him!)\nSPEAK IN This is to take place at Speakers' Corner on Sunday 25th February,\nhopefully all through the day. What we need are as many people as\npossible to take it in turns to read a short speech about the fee increases -just about 10 mins long - hopefully alternating English with a fair\nnumber of foreign languages, so we need plenty of overseas students to\ntake part too.\nHARDSHIP If you think you may not receive additional income to cover any\nincreases in Fees, or you know anyone in that position, then we would\nlike to know about it (anonymously if necessary).\nHELP If you'd like to help with either the lobby-a day or the Speak-in, then\ncome into (or ring) the Union Office (int. 3915) and ask to see Jen\nHardy-Smith, (see the advertisement in this week's FELIX). A full\nbriefing for all those involved or interested will take place on Tuesday\n20th February at 6 pm in the Green Committee Room, Union\nBuilding.\nSheyne Lucock\nExternal Affairs Officer\n\n"
