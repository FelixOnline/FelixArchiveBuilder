    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 24 February 2012\n22\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM\nTime to place your bets an\nFelix Film gazes into the future and predicts the winners for this year\u2019s Oscars \u2013 read at\nBest Picture:\nThe Artist\nWho knew a black and white silent film could be this\ncharming, crowd-pleasing and moving? In this advanced\nday and age of sound, colour and computer graphics, Michel Hazanavicius (director) grasped the hearts of audiences worldwide by taking cinema back to its roots. It\u2019s a\nlove story between the two leads, but also a loving tribute\nto Hollywood. Scooping up pretty much every single Best\nPicture award there is in America, it\u2019s hard to see such a\nrevolutionary film not walking away with the top prize. The\nonly real potential competition this faces is from another\ncritics\u2019 favourite, Alexander Payne\u2019s The Descendants, but\nthe buzz around The Artist is far too strong to topple at\nthis point.\nBest Actor:\nJean Dujardin \u2013 The Artist\nWithout any audible spoken dialogue, the little-known\nFrench actor managed to make everyone fall in love with\nhis handsome and likable George Valentine. The range of\nhis facial expression is astonishing, and the same can\nbe said for his tap-dancing skills. With Cannes, Golden\nGlobe, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA and numerous\ncritics\u2019 circle award wins already under his belt, it would\nbe a safe bet to assume that he is a shoo-in for Oscar\nglory. George Clooney (The Descendants), the next best\nin the category and the potential upset for the night,\nneedn\u2019t be too disheartened. He\u2019s already won an acting\nOscar back in 2006 for Syriana; and the Academy isn\u2019t a\nfan of repeat-winners.\nBest Actress:\nViola Davis \u2013 The Help\nA tough one to guess, since she faces such a strong\ncompetition from the always amazing Meryl Streep, who\ngives yet another superb performance in The Iron Lady\n(the other nominees, I\u2019m afraid, can all forget it). But the\ntides seem to be turning in support for Davis. Having\nwon over her peers as evidenced by her Screen Actors\nGuild Award win, the much underrated actress who has\nalways impressed in dozens of supporting roles, it only\nseems right for her to be credited for her tremendous\nperformance here. It\u2019s a shame to say that Streep\u2019s third\nOscar win will just have to wait another couple of years.\nThere is also huge support for Davis\u2019 film, whereas very\nlittle exists for Streep\u2019s Thatcher biopic.\n\n"

    "content": "In the 1930s, soon after Einstein came up with\nhis equations on general relativity, Karl Schwarzchild developed a solution that predicted what\nbecame known as a black hole. Essentially a\nmass compressed into such a small volume that\nits gravitational pull is literally irresistible; not\neven light is fast enough to escape. But then you\nalready knew that.\nSince then, black holes have been thought to\nexist at the centre of just about every galaxy and\nacts as a cosmic plug hole, pulling matter in and\ncutting it off from the rest of the world. Small\nwonder then that they have such a reputation as\ndestroyers of stars and planets. However, one international team of astronomers is studying an\nopposing side effect \u2013 black holes may help stars\nto form.\nStanislav Shabala of the University of Tasmania, Mark Crockett of University of Oxford and\nSugata Kaviraj of Imperial College led a team to\ninvestigate this phenomenon within the nearby\nCentaurusAgalaxy (a cool 15 million light years\naway). Their results were published in Monthly\nNotices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\nSince most black holes are not static but spin-ning, they can distort the space around them into\nspiral patterns. This means that the stars and\nstellar dust around the black hole are constantly\nin motion, being compressed, stretched, rapidly\nheated and quickly cooled. When enough of\nthis dust comes together in a small enough area,\ngravity acts and clusters form, eventually growing into the bright stars of the sky.\nUsing one of the Hubble Space Telescope\u2019s\ncameras, Wide Field Camera 3, the astronomical\nteam studied what is known in the business as\nNGC 5128, more easily recognised as the Centaurus A galaxy, near (in an astronomical sense)\nthe Centaurus constellation. Scientists observed\na belt of dust running across the galaxy in the\nvisible light spectrum. But inspecting the ultraviolet and X-ray frequencies, they saw that the\nbelt extends almost a million light years from\nthe black hole in the centre. Analysis of this data\nprovided the astronomers with an exceptionally\naccurate map of the history of the stars forming\nin this area.\nIt appears that the distance from the black hole\nand the age of the stars has a correlation; the\nstars at the very extremes of the cosmic outflow\nare younger, increasing in age as you get closer\nto the black hole. This supports the theory that\nthe denser regions of dust near the black hole\nare able to compress into stars, forming at earlier\ntimes.\nBlack holes: cosmic creators\nArtist\u2019s impression of a black hole\nSo why do astronomers look up into the sky\nand take pictures of the stars? Well, one of the\nlargest areas of research in 21st century physics focuses on the conditions of the early universe and what was going on then that led up\nto what we see today. As Dr Shabala comments,\n\u201cThis enhancement of star formation by out-flows would have been even more important in\na younger universe, where dense clumps of gas\nwere much more common. Our study highlights\nthe need to consider the role of \u2018positive\u2019 feedback from outflows in our current paradigm of\ngalaxy formation. It adds an exciting new piece\nto a great puzzle \u2013 that of understanding how\ngalaxies came to be the way they are today.\u201d\nAutistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1% of the population. The main\ncharacteristics of ASD are difficulties in social\ninteraction, communication, and repetitive be-haviours. It is a difficult condition to diagnose,\nespecially in young children, but researchers\nat Birkbeck College have just published some\npromising findings that open a new path to early\ndiagnosis.\nAt the moment, ASD can be diagnosed from\nthe age of two by doctors and psychiatrists with\nthe Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule\n(ADOS) which observes social interaction between the patient and the examiner. Mayada Elsabbagh, from Birkbeck College at the University\nof London, and her colleagues, have published a\nstudy in Current Biology measuring the brain\u2019s\nresponse to viewing faces gazing directly toward\nor away from infants aged between 6 and 10\nmonths, from a sample of 104 infants (54 with\nfamilial risk for ASD and 50 control infants).\nEvent Related Potentials (ERPs) were measured\nby electroencephalography as the children were\nshown faces gazing toward or away from them.\nAt 36 months, the infants were clinically tested\nforASD.\nThe results showed differences between the\ncontrol group, the risk but no ASD group and the\nrisk ASD group. More specifically, the amplitude\nfor gaze shifts away versus toward was higher\nfor the infants not diagnosed with ASD. More\nresearch has to be done, but by developing this\nmethod, a diagnosis for children as young as 6\nmonths old could be possible.\nMost symptoms of ASD are not observed before the child is one, but this study has shown a\nclear difference between infants with and without\nthe disorder. The starting point of the study was\nthe observation that autistic people often find it\ndifficult to look at others in the eye. Describing\nthis difference in sensitivity to eye gaze at such\na young age could provide an explanation of the\nother symptoms of autism. Sensitivity to eye gaze\nis linked to social and communication skills. This\ninsensitivity in infants affects the development of\nthe brain and could provide an explanation for the\nsocial \u2013 communication difficulties that define\nASD.\nASD is still a very misunderstood disorder. It is\nthought to be caused by genetic and environmental factors and some researchers are working on\ndiagnosing from the genome of patients. This is a\ndifficultandcomplextaskaseachpatientisdiffer-ent and many combinations of genetic variations\nhave been known to lead to some form of ASD.\nEarly diagnosis however is crucial. It provides\nparents with the information necessary to explain\ntheir child\u2019s behaviour and take care of them.\nMore importantly, the earlier ASD is diagnosed,\nthe earlier it is possible to \u2018treat\u2019the child and put\nin place the necessary care and support structure.\nThere is no cure forASD, but some methods exist\nand offer the tools to encourage the development\nof the child and his/her social integration. One of\nthese methods,Applied BehaviourAnalysis, uses\nsystematic teaching and behavioural learning theory which is, amid some controversy, successful.\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nFELIX\nFriday 24 February 2012\n10\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nPavitar Singh Devgon\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease affects almost 30 million\npeople around the world but it remains a poorly understood condition with no cure and few effective\ntreatments. However, recent studies by scientists at\nColumbia and Harvard universities provide tantalis-ing evidence of how the disease spreads through\nthe brain and even offer hope of way to stop it in its\ntracks.\nTau proteins have a vital function inside neurons\nin stabilising microtubules, which transport vital\nchemicals around these brain cells. In Alzheimer\u2019s\npatients, however, these proteins become distorted\nand begin to clump together \u2013 causing the tubules\nto collapse and the cells to die. This is known as\ntauopathy. Tangles of tau protein, along with plaques\nconsisting of the beta amyloid peptide, are main biochemical indicators of Alzheimer\u2019s.\nPreviously scientists had been divided on whether\nthis tauopathy spread from one area of the brain to\nneighbouring regions or whether it developed in different areas independently, with some regions being\naffected first since they were more vulnerable.\nStudies on humans had proved inconclusive. Research on mice genetically engineered to produce\nthe distorted human tau was suggested, but was\ninitially abandoned since scientists previously were\nonly able to create mice that produced the faulty\nprotein across their entire brain at the same time,\nmaking it impossible to map how it spread with time.\nHowever, in a paper published in PLoS One, the\nColumbia team describe how they managed to engineer mice which initially only produced the protein\nin the entorhinal cortex, an area of the brain responsible for memory production that is one of the first to\nbe affected by Alzheimer\u2019s in humans.\nExamining the brains of mice of different ages\nshowed clear evidence that tauopathy spread slowly\noutwards from the entorhinal cortex with time. While\nscientists are as yet unsure of the exact mechanism\nthat causes this spread they believe that their findings may apply to humans as the dissected mice\nbrains showed striking similarities to those of deceased Alzheimer\u2019s sufferers.\nBetter knowledge of how Alzheimer\u2019s works may\nlead to people being able to be diagnosed earlier.\nMore importantly, since these findings seem to\nprove the theory that the disease originates in one\npart of the brain, it may be possible to protect neighbouring areas from \u2018infection\u2019 \u2013 thereby preventing\nfurther progression of the disease.\nFurther research with the genetically modified\nmice may help to identify specific treatments that\naccomplish this. Scientists also suspect that other\ndegenerative brain diseases, such as Parkinson\u2019s,\nmight spread through the brain in a similar manner,\nmeaning that it is possible that treatments for them\nwill also be found.\nMarie-Laure Hicks\nNew research into Alzheimer\u2019s\nNew autism diagnosis in infants\nLast year\u2019s announcement by the OPERA particle\nphysics collaboration that they had seen neutrinos\ntravel faster than light may have been down to nothing more than dodgy wiring, it was announced yester-day. One of two possible causes was a faulty optical\nfibre, and the other concerns an oscillator used in\nGPS clock synchronisation. OPERA is still studying\nthe extent of these two effects. New measurements\nare planned for May.\nKelly Oakes\nFast neutrinos foiled by wiring\n\n"

It is in everyone\u2019s interest that the LHC continues\nto fulfill its task and help us unravel the\nbeautiful mathematics that regulates\nour Universe. In the eventuality that the\nHiggs boson is not discovered, our current theories will have to be completely\nrevised and researchers would have to\nface whole new challenges.\nhttp://press.web.cern.ch/press/PressRe-leases/Releases2012/PR01.12E.html\nSCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 24 February 2012 11\nExploring the God Particle\nMichele Tonutti explores the Large Hadron Collider\u2019s main experiment\nPhysical Sciences Laboratory, University of Wisconsin-Madison\nI\nf the God Particle is real, 2012\nwill be the year of its discov-ery. Scientists at CERN have\nbeen searching for proof of the\nexistence Higgs boson since\n2008, when the construction of the\nLarge Hadron Collider finally came\nto an end. Now, after four years, the\nLHC \u2013 a 27-kilometre ring of superconducting magnets located in Geneva,\nSwitzerland \u2013 is ready to take up a new\nchallenge. On 13 February, CERN announced that in the next year the Collider will fire proton rays at an energy of\n4 TeV. Until now, the LHC has run at a\nbeam energy of \u2018only\u2019 1.18 TeV (Phys-ics fun fact: 1TeV is about the kinetic\nenergy of a flying mosquito). Up until\n2009, the highest energy used for this\nkind of experiment was less than 1 TeV;\nthis record was held by the Tevatron accelerator at the Fermi Laboratory in Illinois, USA.\nSo far, researchers have been hesitant\nto boost up the working energy of the\nLHC, even though the system is meant\nto sustain collisions of protons up to 14\nTeV. The major quench incident that occurred in 2008, just a few months after\nthe inauguration, showed that extreme\ncare is needed when dealing with such\nhighly energetic particles. In that case,\nfaulty connection between magnets\ncaused six tons of liquid helium to be\ndispersed in the tunnel. This caused\nheavy damage to the instrumentation,\nforcing CERN to stop the experiment\nfor several weeks. Money and time\nwere wasted, and people\u2019s safety threat-ened.\nMoreover, in March 2010, the new\nresearch program officially started with\na 7 TeV proton collision (3.5 TeV per\nbeam), causing mass panic around the\nworld and rumors of a possible catas-trophe. Despite the general fear, the\nLHC has been functioning as smoothly\nas ever. However, the potential risks of\nthese experiments are not to be ignored.\nIn the press release following the an-nouncement, CERN\u2019s Director for Accelerators and Technology Steve Myers said: \u201cWhen we started operating\nthe LHC for physics in 2010, we chose\nthe lowest safe beam energy consistent\nwith the physics we wanted to do. Two\ngood years of operational experience\nwith beam and many additional measurements made during 2011 give us the\nconfidence to safely move up a notch,\nand thereby extend the physics reach of\nthe experiments.\u201d\nMyers also mentioned that the LHC\nwill undergo a long shutdown at the\nend of the year. During this 20-months\nbreak, new technology and improvements will be implemented, so that in\n2015 the collider will be able to work\nat the maximum energy of 7 TeV per\nbeam. However, Research Director Sergio Bertolucci believes that it is likely\nthat major results will already be seen\nby the end of the year. \u201cBy the time the\nLHC goes into its first long stop at the\nend of this year, we will either know\nthat a Higgs particle exists or have ruled\nout the existence of a Standard Model\nHiggs,\u201d he claims in the press release.\n\u201cEither would be a major advance in\nour exploration of nature, bringing us\ncloser to understanding how the fundamental particles acquire their mass, and\nmarking the beginning of a new chapter\nin particle physics.\u201d\nThe Higgs boson is often referred to as\nthe \u201cGod Particle\u201d because of its central\nimportance in modern particle physics.\nAccording to the Standard Model \u2013 the\ncurrently most accepted theory on interactions between particles and forces \u2013\nits existence is necessary to explain why\nall the other particles have most of their\nmass. Its discovery would therefore\nconstitute a major step forward towards\na better understanding of how the laws\ngoverning our Universe work.\nThe LHC is the main contributor of\ndata regarding the Higgs boson, and\nthe announcement strengthened the already widely held feeling that we are\nnow closer to finding this particle than\nwe have ever been before. The results\nproduced by ATLAS and CMS, the two\nmain experiments looking for the Higgs\nat CERN in the past few years, allowed\nphysicists to narrow down the hypothetical mass of the Higgs to a window\nof merely 16 GeV. This mass is now\nthought to be around 124-126 GeV.\nHowever, for the results to be considered a real discovery a year\u2019s worth of\nconsistent observations are needed. Statistically speaking, particle physics has\na well defined definition of \u2018discovery\u2019:\ndata must have a five-sigma (or five\nstandard deviations) level of certainty.\nThis is simply a scale of how unlikely\nit is that the results are only a product\nof chance rather than an actual effect of\na physical phenomenon. In a nutshell, a\nthree-sigma level would represent the\nThe Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) general purpose detector at CERN, used for studying the effects of proton-proton collisions\nAre we on a collision course with the Higgs boson?\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nFELIX Friday 24 February 2012 17\nNever let Ishiguro go\nSure, this book involves a parallel soci-ety, human cloning, and organ farming,\nnarrated through the eyes of an independent and vaguely rebellious protag-onist, but still: Never Let Me Go isn\u2019t\nwhat you would expect from a work\nof science fiction. With little futuristic\ntechnology and absolutely no extraterrestrial life forms to be seen, Kazuo\nIshiguro\u2019s most recent novel captures\nthe reader\u2019s attention not with ray guns\nand worm holes but with characterisa-tion and imagery.\nBefore I go on, I have a confession to\nmake: I watched the movie first. I know,\nI know; I\u2019m doomed to picture the characters as the actors that portray them,\nI couldn\u2019t possibly approach the novel\nin quite the same way, everything\u2019s hor-rible, why would I ever do that, et ce-tera. And while I certainly suggest you\nread the book before seeing the movie\n(which may or may not have something\nto do with Keira Knightley), the latter\ndoesn\u2019t ruin the former. Don\u2019t let having seen the film put you off. (Just as\nlong as you remember that Robbie is,\nin fact, not the newest incarnation of\nSpider-Man.)\nSet in England during the late twentieth century, the novel\u2019s premise is\nan alternate history in which medical\ntechnology has already advanced to the\npoint of human cloning. Seeing this as\na possibility for the improvement of\nmedicine as a whole, society has established clones as a source of spare parts:\nthey are raised like cattle (except with\nmore instruction in the arts) in institutions eerily reminiscent of boarding\nschools until they reach adulthood, at\nwhich point they begin \u2018donating\u2019 non-vital organs one by one until they \u2018complete\u2019. As a result, human lifespans\nhave been expanded \u2013 and collective\nconceptions of ethics eliminated.\nThe protagonists are three such clones\nwho have grown up together at Hailsham, one of the \u2018schools\u2019. Narrated by\nKathy, one of the three friends, the story is a series of recollections from her\npast. It is split into three parts \u2013 representative of three stages of their lives \u2013\nwith less than ten pages taking place in\nthe present tense. This structure opens\nitself up to a lack of plot focus: more\ntime is spent layering flashbacks within\nflashbacks, their context often ruled by\nKathy\u2019s thought processes, than retelling key events.\nThe book is narrated in the first person and so the reader\u2019s only window\ninto this parallel world is through\nKathy\u2019s mind. Her passively observant\npersonality colours this window with a\nstrange sense of detachment. It is not\nuntil the reader puts the book down and\nagain begins to look at things through\nhis own eyes that certain absurdities\nof their society reveal the full extent\nof their strangeness. Kathy, like all the\nother clones, is, for most of the novel,\nso complacent with what is done to her\nthat the reader initially struggles to find\nthe events as revolting as they truly are.\nThe novel is thus an exercise in self-ex-ploration for the reader as much as the\ncharacters; I, for one, thought it shocking how non-immediate my moral response to the story was.\n\u2018Completion\u2019, the euphemism for\ndeath used by all characters throughout\nthe book, is one example of the way\ncharacters confront the world they were\nborn into: they don\u2019t. Even though they\nare (mistakenly) informed about their\nfate at a young age, the trio of protagonists rarely questions its nature and, if\nthey do, it is in the form of throwaway\ncomments rather than fundamental considerations of the value of their exis-tence. While each character is aware of\nthe truth, they seem to refuse to admit it\nto each other, allowing each individual\nto continue life in their own bubble of\nfictitious safety.\nHaving read only one other of Ishiguro\u2019s pieces, The Remains of the Day,\nI suppose I\u2019m not really qualified to\nmake sweeping generalisations about\nhis writing voice and stylistic idiosyn-crasies. But certain elements are still\napparent. Without spending significant\namounts of time simply describing the\nscenery, Ishiguro manages to create\nstrikingly beautiful images to accompany his stories by relying on the reader\u2019s\nown memories and imagination. Also,\nin both novels, the characters and their\nrelationships are all Very British: emotional restraint and tact underline their\ninteractions. Fellow Eddie Izzard aficionados will remember the compari-son: \u201cOh, I\u2019m... oh. Well, I \u2013\u201d \u201cWhat is\nit, Sebastian?\u201d \u201cI thought you... I better\ngo.\u201d It is not the kind of drama you eat\npopcorn to.\nThe downside of this is that, occa-sionally, conversations become almost\nA call to arms in the fight to save our libraries\nI first found out about The Library\nBook in a small addendum to a piece\nin the Guardian by Lucy Mangan,\none of my favourite columnists, announcing that she was one of the\ncontributors. Investigating further, I\nbecame even more interested upon\nfinding out that the contributors\nalso included such impressive figures as Stephen Fry, China Mi\u00e9ville\nand Alan Bennett. Yet, even having\nknown beforehand the amount of talent involved I have to say that the\nbook far exceeded my expectations.\nIn essence The Library Book is\nsimply twenty five highly skilled\njournalists, writers, broadcasters and\nother public figures coming together\nto each write a short piece, whether\na fictional story, essay or deeply personal recollection, focusing on their\nlove of libraries. The book comes in\nat under 200 pages and yet manages\nto include a breathtaking degree of\nvariety. From Mangan\u2019s hilarious description of the rules she would put\nin place if she were ever to set up her\nown library, to Bennett\u2019s engrossing\nand fantastically detailed account of\nthe importance libraries played in\nhis early life and education, to Julie Myerson\u2019s story of how libraries\nhelped her become a writer \u2013 which\nwas honestly the most inspirational\nthing that I have read in the last year.\nGiven the situation that many libraries now find themselves its no\nKazuo Ishiguro applies his unique writing style to the realm of science fiction\n\u201cMovement through\nthe novel is guided\nnot by actions or\nevents but by memories and realisations.\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski surprise that many of the contributions have a political spin. While\nreferences to specific politicians\nmay quickly become dated the central message \u2013 that libraries are vital\nresources that can not only help the\ndisadvantaged but also bring communities together \u2013 is timeless. In\nthe words of Karin Slaughter \u2013 \u201cKids\nwho read become students who do\nwell in school. Students who do well\nin school go to college.

This\nbook should be required reading\nfor all those in government who are\nconsidering closing down libraries.\nIn short, this is both an entertaining and stimulating read that should\nappeal to anyone who loves books.\nThe skill of the contributors is visible\nfrom the outset and the short length\nonly serves to make its laudable message all the clearer and means that\nthe book it accessible even to those\nwho don\u2019t have much free time.\ntoo stilted for comfort. As a whole,\nhowever, it works; Ishiguro\u2019s style\nonly enhances the impression that the\ncharacters are living next to each other\ninstead of together, that many of their\nrelationships (with the exception, per-haps, of Tommy and Kathy\u2019s) lack a\ncertain element of depth because they,\nas a mechanism of self-defense, refuse\nto open up. The presence of this closed-ness throughout the novel makes rare\nmoments where it is broken all the\nmore powerful. One scene, in particular\n(and I shan\u2019t spoil it) carries such raw\nemotion that, in less than two pages,\nit brings to the reader an explicit understanding of the character\u2019s strug-gles, and a revelation of the author\u2019s\npurpose. This would not be nearly as\npowerful were it not for the context of\nthe rest of the novel, which gradually\nbuilds up the backdrop onto which the\ntruth is painted.\nMovement through the novel is\nguided not by actions or events but by\nmemories and realisations. Don\u2019t get\nme wrong: it\u2019s not boring. It\u2019s beautiful.\n(Granted, this is coming from someone\nwho much prefers character-based writ-ing. If, browsing the sci-fi shelf, you are\nlooking for action-packed adventures\nand heroic acts, you may be disap-pointed.) Page by page, Kathy comes\nto terms with her past and, as a conse-quence, her future. Ultimately \u2013 and I\nsay this at the risk of being incredibly\ncheesy \u2013 it is a story of love and the\nmeaning of life. The element of science\nfiction is used as a foundation for the\ndevelopment of characters and messages that are as applicable to our world as\nit is to theirs.\nCall me cynical, but I find the quality\nof writing in this genre rather hit and\nmiss.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 24 february 2012 15\nL\nate on a Tuesday night, a\nmonster was born. One that\nwould increase exponentially with size; prove that\nImperial students, for all\ntheir academic brilliance, follow the same\nbehavioural patterns in a crowd as anyone\nelse; and leave many of us sleep-deprived\nduring our 9 o\u2019clock lectures the following day.\nThe phenomenon fizzled out as soon\nas it exploded onto our screens: most of\nthe activity was within the first 24 hours;\nanother 24 hours later and the group\u2019s\nactivity had mostly ceased. I know a few\npeople have looked upon it and wondered\nhow something like this hasn\u2019t happened\nbefore: there are a huge number of jokes\nto be made from the relatively mundane\ngripes about everything from Imperial\u2019s\nemail system to the shortcomings of various campus eateries. Nothing remotely\ninsightful,butthingsthatpeoplecanrelate\nto. Indeed, upon the afternoon/evening\nwhen everyone was done with lectures,\nserendipitously on a Wednesday when\neveryone is free after 12, the \u201cmemes\u201d\ncame thick and fast, rapidly expending\nany joke that is vaguely Imperial-related\nor funny. I put the salient word in quotation marks because technically these templates with text aren\u2019t a meme \u2013 a meme\nis only formed if it becomes popular and\nspreads. You can\u2019t just \u201ccreate\u201d one.\nBy Thursday, the Facebook page was\ndominated by increasingly wordy pic-tures, reposts and somewhat nonsensical\ncontributions \u2013 signs that the low-hang-ing fruit such as the sex ratio or Imperial\u2019s\nworkload have long since been eaten. It\ntakes insight, effort, or considerable luck\nthat you\u2019ve stumbled upon an observation nobody else has in order to be funny.\nOnce all the easy jokes have been made,\nyou quickly find yourself scraping the\nThe great Executive Committee blunder\nImperial Memes: a post mortem\nbarrel since there\u2019s no new input mate-rial. Jokes are not a renewable resource.\nOn a positive note, among the convoluted\nadditions there were several genuinely\nwitty ones that were borne from an earnest attempt to be original.Alot of people\nsimply don\u2019t care enough to spend a good\nhour thinking up something clever, so\nthey fart out the first thing that comes to\nmind so they can be part of this fad. Fair\nenough, it\u2019s not something to be taken se-riously, and if this annoys you then you\nneed to chill out: being unfunny is as-ymptomatic of any remotely pathological\nbehaviour.\nTwo weeks on from the page\u2019s incep-tion, and activity has slowed to a trickle.\nYou still get the odd Slowpoke who completely neglects that someone else might\nhave actually taken the mickey out of\nHuxley building\u2019s labyrinthine layout al-ready, but now most of the posts seem to\nbe made by those who make a genuine effort to make a new joke, since it\u2019s no longer a bandwagon to jump upon as quickly\nas possible any more \u2013 which encouraged\npeople to slam on their keyboards and\ncrack out a \u201cmeme\u201d as quickly as pos-sible.\nOne of the real \u201cmemes\u201d in the Imperial Memes page turned out to be making\njokes about the eastern Asians at Imperial, which progressively ventured into\nthe realms of outright racism. In theory,\nthere is no problem with making a joke\nabout a stereotype as long as it ends with\nthat. However, issues can arise with the\nvery existence of a mild \u201cracist\u201d joke that\nmight well be quite clever and innocuous within the right context: there is the\ndanger that without any sort of criticism\nor way of keeping things in check then\nincreasingly more offensive comments\nbecome acceptable. I suspect this is how\ntime after time you see once-hilarious\nT\nhe Union\u2019s Executive\nCommittee is charged\nwith deciding how the\nUnion is run on a day-to-day basis. It approves\nthings like the Summer Ball, and the\nwhole Union\u2019s, budget to make sure\nthings are progressing how the student body wants them to. Three weeks\nago the Executive Committee chose\nto reallocate nearly \u00a335,000 away\nfrom Clubs and Societies funding.\nThe rationale given by Michael Foster (Deputy President for Finance and\nServices) for this 10% cut was that\n\u201cthe total grant underspend [by clubs\nand societies] last year was greater\nthan the changes to funding.\u201d Grant\nmoney left unspent at the end of the\nyear by a club is reabsorbed by the\nUnion and generally deemed as unnecessary funding. Foster then went\non to say \u201cthe reallocated money will\nbe much more effective invested in\nsupport mechanisms.\u201d\nIt has since emerged that this figure\nof 10% is incorrect and that an accounting mistake led to the Executive\nCommittee being misinformed as to\nthe magnitude of the underspend. The\ntrue figure is now understood to be\n3.9% yet the reallocated amount still\nstands at 10%, leaving clubs without\nmoney which in the past has been put\nto good use. This cut is going to have\na much greater effect than previously\nthought by club officers \u2013 and indeed\nthe Executive Committee who made\nthe decision. Club budgets will be\ndecided by the Clubs and Societies\u2019\nBoard (CSB) on the 27th February,\nleaving the Executive Committee no\ntime to reconsider the cut undertaken\nwith erroneous information. The CSB\ntherefore has no choice but to cut 10%\nof last year\u2019s pot from needy clubs\nand suggest that the members of these\nclubs will have to make up the difference themselves.\nThe Executive Committee clearly\nhas a big impact on how Union societies and bars are run but many of these\ndecisions, including the one over\nclub funding, are made behind closed\ncomedians fall from grace: their material slowly adopts a tinge of blue, slowly\nenough for their audiences to get used to\nit, until one day someone who\u2019s never\nwatched any of their shows complains\nto Ofcom and highlights what\u2019s now\nbecome Klansman-level racism. There\u2019s\nno danger of this slippery slope if you\u2019re\ntaking a stab at faulty College facilities \u2013\ndespite my sincerest hope that the new Library doors can feel it every time they\u2019re\ncursed at, their marginalisation will never\nbe a problem. Even the inter-departmen-tal snobbery that as a physicist I dabble in\nis fine: there is nowhere for \u201cengineering\nDoes this caption help clear it up?

The student body therefore\nhas no capacity to review financial\nor commercial decisions made by the\nSabbatical Officers. These Executive\nmeetings offer a means for personal\nviews to be approved by an often ill-informed committee. Clearly an overhaul of the commercial decision making process is required \u2013 either the\nmembership of the Executive needs\nto be opened up in order to break the\nSabbatical\u2019s strangle hold on it, or the\nUnion Council needs the capacity to\nreview these closed-door decisions.\nUntil then, we\u2019ll still be burdened by\nthe risk of our elected officers making\npoor commercial and financial deci-sions.\nHenry Abbot\nVeli Akiner\n\n"

After decades in\nthe business and several major films, this is only Plummer\u2019s second nomination, but it will be wise to start polishing up on his acceptance speech. His restrained yet\nabsorbing performance as a gay father and recent widower who comes out of the closet in the last few years\nof his life has won the critics over, having already scored\nmore than a dozen prestigious awards for this role. It\u2019s\nnever too late to win an Oscar, and Plummer certainly\nproves that.\nBest Supporting Actress:\nOctavia Spencer \u2013 The Help\nNot much room for debate here. Spencer is hands-down\nthe most memorable performer of the lot as the straight-talking, strong-spirited Minny Jackson. The fact that there\nis much critical acclaim around the film is also a strong\npushing point, a key factor a couple of her competitors\nseem to lack (Melissa McCarthy \u2013 Bridesmaids, Janet\nMcTeer \u2013 Albert Nobbs). The only real visible threat is\nB\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo who, if The Artist decides to clean house\non Sunday can cause an upset with a surprise win in\nher category, but Bejo herself hasn\u2019t been the subject of\nmuch attention when it came to actual winning. Spencer\nis a relative unknown, but this awards season will do wonders for her career.\nBest Director:\nMichel Hazanavicius \u2013 The Artist\nIt takes guts to make a silent, black and white film, but\nHazanavicius (above, with the canine star of The Artist,\nUggie) managed to create something truly enchanting\nand extraordinary. It has been years since the Academy\npaid attention to a black and white film, let alone a silent\none, but The Artist has been the talk of the town and Hazanavicius is the man responsible for this miracle. Hopefully he has paved the way for filmmakers to take more\nbold, unusual steps, but only time will tell on the legacy\nhe will leave behind with his latest work. But for the time\nbeing, he should enjoy and soak up all the applause and\nacclaim he and his film are currently receiving. He deserves it.\n\n"

    "content": "ment. For example, Jim Murphy, a\nlawyer who has been very critical of\nthe Get Britain Working scheme, said\nthat it \u201camounts to exploitation, decided at the whim of a Jobcentre Plus\nadviser.\u201d None of this is true. In fact,\nas of last year, Jobcentre Plus doesn\u2019t\neven exist at all. It is now merely the\npublic face of the DWP.\nIn its place are a series of private\nemployment consultancy firms. In\nLondon, for instance, the MWA is\nprovided by a company called Seetec,\nin the South East by A4e. A4e has a\nparticularly bad reputation. On Monday, the Mail published an article stating \u201cLabour MPs claim A4e\u2019s record\non finding people jobs is \u2018abysmal\u2019\u201d\nand demanding that Emma Harrison,\nthe head of A4e, should stand down.\nIt seems that while Harrison was in\ncharge of A4e, she was also advising the government on its Get Britain\nWorking programme. Presumably not\njust an innocent coincidence.\nNor is Seetec scandal-free. According to the unemployment rights\nblog Intensive Activity, Seetec do not\nprovide refunds for travel expenses,\nthough they are obliged to do so in their\ncontract. MWA participants in London,\nthen, are forced to choose between\nlosing all their JSA, or spending it on\ntransport to and from their compulsory\nwork. A weekly London bus pass for\na JSA recipient is \u00a39.40: for an unemployed young person, this reduces total\nweekly income to around \u00a344. MWA\ntherefore makes life extremely uncomfortable for a jobless young Londoner.\nIt is worth remembering that the\ncareers advisers mentioned above are\nemployees of these companies. They\nhave the authority to make someone\ntake up Mandatory Work Activity, and\ntherefore the power to cause serious\nsuffering to an individual whenever\nthey so desire. Being private contrac-tors, they are accountable to no one but\ntheir managers, and there is no formal\nmeans of complaint except, of course,\nthrough the courts. It is impossible,\nthen, for even the Secretary of State to\nsack a bad adviser.\nThe MWA contract between the government and Seetec is available online,\nand it includes a clause stating that\nSeetec (and presumably also the other\ncompanies) are paid according to how\nmany people they get onto MWA. Peraps advisers would force job seekers\ninto MWA in more situations than nec-essary, just to make more money. After all, making money is what private\ncompanies do.\nGovernment statistics released this\nmonth (see above graph) show that\nthe ratio of MWA to Work Experience\nparticipants \u2013 a ratio we would expect\nto stay roughly constant \u2013 sharply increased in September and again in\nNovember; funnily enough, September was the month in which Jobcentre\nPlus started being replaced by private\nemployment consultants. The joys of\nprivatisation...\nGiven all the above, I think it is fair\nto say that the switch from Jobcentre\nPlus to private consultants was a bad\nidea. There is the corruption at A4e,\nthe illegal behaviour at Seetec, the very\nhigh possibility of unnecessary forced\nlabour, and the unaccountability of the\nadvisers, and all of this just since September 2011. Conservatives... What\nwill they do next, privatise the NHS?\nWho benefits?\nAll premeditated crimes have motives,\nand the same can be said for the Get\nBritain Working programme. Who\nbenefits? There are at least five parties\nto consider: the job seekers, the gov-ernment, the taxpayers, the employment consultants, and the corporations.\nAll could lose or gain from the work\nexperience schemes; looking at who\ngets what might enlighten us to the\ntruth.\nFirst, the job seekers. The scheme is\nintended to help them, as the Department for Work and Pensions says, they\nmean to \u201cfight poverty, support the\nmost vulnerable and help people break\nthe cycle of benefit dependency.\u201d But\nthe latest unemployment figures reveal\n8.4% unemployment, which rises to\n22.2% among 16 to 24-year-olds, and\nunemployment is rising all the time: so\nthe work experience scheme will not\nhave an appreciable effect on youth\nunemployment. It is arguable that the\njobless are gaining skills for their CVs\nfor when the recession is over; but this\nargument must be set against the fact\nthat job seekers are being forced to\nwork for under \u00a32 per hour. I think we\ncan confidently say that, except in perhaps a few circumstances, job seekers\ndo not benefit from the scheme.\nThe media and (to an extent) public\nhysteria about \u201cbenefit scroungers\u201d\nwas fairly ubiquitous in 2011; the Daily Mail\u2019s infamous Jan Moir, for exam-ple, said of Cait Reilly, \u201cnobody owes\nthis girl a living. Least of all those who\nwork.\u201d Then, Get Britain Working\nprobably seemed like it was working\nfor the government. Now, however, the\nsame Daily Mail has criticised the government\u2019s handling of the scheme, and\non top of this there are public protests\nand suggestions that the government\nwants to return us to Victorian Britain.\nAs yet there are no reliable polls on the\nmatter so it is hard to tell, but I would\nguess that the weight public opinion\nis against the government in this case:\nthey thought they would benefit from\nthe scheme but they haven\u2019t.\nIf taxpayers benefit from the scheme\nit can only be because fewer people\nare accepting Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance,\neither because they have returned to\nwork, or because they have had their\nallowance removed as punishment.\nUnemployment is rising, and has been\nfor some time, so the former cannot be\ntrue. As for the latter, it is impossible to\ntell how many people have been pun-ished, since the published statistics are\nso minimal they could hardly be called\nstatistics at all.\nWe do know, however, that 24,010\npeople were referred to MWA between\nMay and November 2011. If we assume that 10% of these were punished\nand lost their benefits for 13 weeks, the\ngovernment will have saved about \u00a32\nmillion, a negligible quantity. Since\nMWA is the most punitive and the\nmost used of the three work experience schemes, we can guess a total of\nabout \u00a36 million gained from the work\nprogramme in 6 months. The taxpayer,\nthen, can hardly be said to benefit.\nComparatively, employment consultancy firms must adore Get Britain\nWorking. Not only does the privatisation of Jobcentre Plus provide companies like Seetec and A4e with very\nlucrative contracts, but the government is a customer which can (hope-fully) never run out of money. There is\nno doubt that these companies benefit\ngreatly from the programme.\nWith corporations it is a much more\ncomplex story. Let us take Tesco, for\nexample. At first, they benefited slightly from the scheme: for each MWA\nplacement, they got 120 hours of labour for free. That\u2019s \u00a3730 saved per\nperson, at minimum wage. But Tesco\nis a vast corporation, so the amount of\nmoney which they saved in this way is\nnegligible.\nRecently, however, Tesco has suffered from serious public anger. After\nan advert was placed on the Jobcentre\nPlus website advertising work at Tesco\nin return for Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance,\nthousands of angry consumers attacked\nTesco\u2019s Facebook wall threatening to\nboycott the company until they stopped\nemploying MWA participants. Soon\nafterwards, angry campaigners staged\na protest at a Tesco store in Westmister,\nforcing it to close.\nOver all, Tesco has not benefited\nfrom Get Britain Working, and the\nsame can be said, though to a lesser\nextent, of the other participating cor-porations.\nStupid or evil?\nWe are left, then, with a government\nscheme in which the only beneficiaries\nare private employment consultants.\nAlthough, were it not for the unanticipated public anger, the government\nand some corporations would have\nbenefited also. Job seekers, for whom\nthe scheme is allegedly designed, come\nout worse off over all.\nWhich leaves one question: is Get\nBritain Working a very poorly designed scheme or a cynical attack on\nthe unemployed? I know which side I\ncome down on: government advisers\nare surely not stupid enough to unintentionally create such a dreadful pro-gramme.\nWhat we have here is a nasty scheme\nwhich punishes the unemployed and\nbenefits only a few companies; which\nputs power into the hands of unaccountable advisers, and pays them to\nabuse it; which has the ability to totally\nruin the lives of those it is explicitly intended to help. But it is a scheme which\nmany of us may soon have to face.\nAs graduation day approaches, and\nyouth unemployment rises, the Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance looks like an increasingly likely possibility. But we\nmust be wary: this is a programme\ndesigned to trick the jobless, not help\nthem.

When we switch off like this\nwe can sleepwalk through the days and\nfind that life simply passes us by. As we\nwatch time slip past, we seldom take the\nchance to ask the important questions:\nWhy are we here? What is the meaning\nof life?

Questions of what it means\nto be human and what purpose life\nserves (if any) should not be limited to\nlectures in the humanities department\nor late night ramblings after watching\nThe Matrix.\nMaybe we can blame Imperial for not\nputting enough emphasis on humanities\nor that they give us too much work as\nexcuses for why we never have a chance\nto stimulate such debates about the soul\nand purpose of life. Whatever the rea-son, maybe you could take a moment\nand think about it for a second. Whether you are agnostic, atheist or religious,\npeople always think about where we are\nand where we are going. The idea of a\nsoul is one that everyone has considered\nand yet not discussed.\nThe Islamic Society will be looking\nto ask some of these questions during its \u2018Discover Islam Week\u2019 (DIW)\nthat kicks off on Monday 27 February\nwhere we will begin by examining the\nnature of the soul and exploring ideas\nof spirituality and asking what it fundamentally means to be human. On\nTuesday 6 March, Dr Timothy Winters\nwill be asking what it means to be free\nand whether ideas of faith and liberty\nare fundamentally in opposition. What\ndoes it mean to be free? Do you have\nfree will? Does being faithful mean you\naren\u2019t free? Come discuss these questions in the Q&A.\nThe week will also feature exhibitions on Tuesday 28 and Thursday 1\nMarch in the SAF building on all aspects of Islam. The exhibitions will\nconsist of both informational posters\nand decorative Islamic cultural decora-tions.

There will people around\nto talk to and answer any questions you\nmay have about Islam.\nDIW is an opportunity for everyone\non campus to take a step back from the\nwork and explore these questions as a\ncollective.

    "content": "MUSIC\nA few of you may remember an article which appeared in Felix Music last term about a trampy\nman who played an acoustic gig on a boat. Well\nthis man is about to have his Imperial fame replenished as this week I acquaint you with UK post-hardcore masterminds Meet Me In St. Louis.\nThe band, fronted by aforementioned trampy\nman, Tobias Hayes, are once again from Surrey,\nand after forming in 2005 only had a very short\nlifespan of 3 years. Despite their massively premature demise, Meet Me In St. Louis are loved\nso dearly within the UK independent music scene\nthat they even have a day dedicated to them (24th\nSeptember, the day their debut album was re-leased) so everyone can remember how amazing\nthey were. This widespread affection for the band\nis completely justified and I can quite proudly say\nthat they are possibly the best band I\u2019ve ever laid\nears on (not literally, don\u2018t be trying any funny busi-ness).\nAs you may have noticed, their name has been\nstolen from an old American musical and this\ntheme continues with every one of their tracks being titled after lines from films (10 points if you\nknow which films they\u2019re all from). But moving on\nto the more important matter: their music. Meet\nMe In St. Louis have an absolutely unique sound\nand it truly is incredible to witness. They get the\nmixture of sliding mathy riffs and intense breakdowns absolutely perfect and then incorporate\ncontinually changing time signatures to keep you\non your toes. As musicians, the members of this\nband will not fail to amaze you. It\u2019s very rare to\nlisten to a track that the bass part catches you\ndoing some air-bass but bassist Lewis Reynolds\nhas well and truly made a slapper out of me (not\nlike that, I meant as in slapper of the bass \u2013 the\nguitar, not the fish).\nI don\u2019t mean to undermine the other members of\nthe band; believe me, after listening to MMISL you\nwill be a master of the air-everything. Their debut\n(and only) album Variations On Swing is essential\nto your life and is by far one of the best pieces\nof post-hardcore I\u2019ve heard. So go get your filthy\nhands on it, check out the recommendation and\nsee you all next week!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendation\nListen to \u2018All We Need is a Little Energon and a Lot\nof Luck\u2019 (that\u2019s a quote from the old Transformers,\nby the way).\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nLesson 7: Meet Me In St. Louis\nFELIX Friday 24 February 2012 19\nO2 Academy, Islington\nMonday 27 Feburary\nBe sure not to miss...\nDilated Peoples\nAt a loose end on Monday night?

I can\u2019t, so please do it for me.\nAlex Ramadan\non you.\nIn conclusion, the band isn\u2019t actually very\ngood. But to be honest, being good isn\u2019t really the point of them. One doesn\u2019t listen to an\nAxCx album for the music in the same way one\ndoesn\u2019t buy a Bugatti Veyron to use as a car, or\nan Apple Mac to use as a computer. It\u2019s about\nthe concept behind the product as opposed to\nthe product itself. Anal Cunt are just about being monstrously offensive in every possible\nway, and by fully committing to the cause, become so much greater than their sum of their\nparts.\nand incomprehensibly screeched lyrics. The\nsongs have little to no structure and barely last\nmore than 40 seconds. They are undeniably the\nmost difficult band to listen to ever. It is impossible to take them seriously and herein lies their\nbeauty and the root of their enduring success.\nAxCx were, for their entire 23-year existence,\na joke, and the joke itself is the key to their sur-vival.\nIt\u2019s not to say that Seth Putnam and the various others that joined him in the band\u2019s line up\nover the two decades hated extreme metal and\nwere maliciously attacking it, rather they realised that by making music that was so offensive it could only be justified by having horrific\nlyrics and song titles, and vice-versa. That the\njoke itself was never explicitly stated made it\nall the better, with a notable moment being the\nrelease in 1998 of Picnic of Love, an album of\nacoustic guitar, falsetto vocals and song titles\nsuch as \u2018I Respect Your Feelings as a Woman\nand a Human\u2019.\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear who the joke was on.\nPerhaps on the people who don\u2019t get the joke,\nor it\u2019s actually on the people who do get the\njoke but listen anyway. If you think about it too\nhard however, you realise that you\u2019re trying to\nderive some profound definition of satire from\na 47-second long segment of white noise and\nscreaming entitled \u2018I Pushed Your Wife in Front\nof the Subway\u2019 by a band called Anal Cunt and\nget the sneaking suspicion that the joke is in fact\nI\nwas exceptionally upset to hear about\nthe death last June of Seth Putnam, lead\nsinger of Anal Cunt (or AxCx). For\nsome reason, his death wasn\u2019t reported\nthat widely in the mainstream media, and\nin my post-teenage years my involvement in the\nmetal scene has been dramatically diminished,\nso his passing passed me by. I loved his band\nmore than can possibly be explained in anything\napproaching logical terms, but I hope to make\nyou want to listen to them anyway.\nI rarely make it through an entire AxCx al-bum, and never in polite company. I generally\ndip in and out for about 5 minutes or so before having to not listen to anything else for a\ncouple of hours. To call this band challenging is\nsimilar to calling World War II bad: undeniably\ntrue, but so wildly understated as to make the\ndescription seem fatuously incorrect. Simply\nreading the track listing of an AxCx album is an\nuncomfortable experience, and most of the song\ntitles are un-printable. For the full horror expe-rience, I recommended going to the Wikipedia\npage for their 1999 opus, It Just Gets Worse.\nIf you manage to do that without contacting\nThe Daily Telegraph, I would recommend popping the album on. The songs are the logical-extreme of what can be considered music, and\nthat is exceptionally dependent on how loosely\none is willing to define \u201cmusic\u201d.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX Friday 24 february 2012 5\nthe students were stirred because \u201c[the\nArchbishop] is in some respects a representative of the college\u201d. There was\na widespread outcry amongst the majority of undergraduate students at the\nUniversity, showing their dismay at an\nadvocate of their institution \u201cpromoting discrimination\u201d. Through engaging in the public discussion Selwyn\nCollege have shown that Archbishop\nSentamu\u2019s views are in the minority,\nthe majority of which support complete\nmarriage equality.\nAlfredo Carpineti, President of IQ,\nImperial\u2019s LGBT Society, commented\non the Archbishop\u2019s interview, seeing\nhim as \u201chiding behind the banner of\npreserving tradition and history\u201d. Carpineti insists that following this view\nwould have meant, \u201cwomen wouldn\u2019t\nbe allowed to vote, the slave trade\nwould still be legal and most of the\nadvances in Science, Technology and\nMedicine wouldn\u2019t exist\u201d.\nHe concludes that, \u201cgay marriage is\nlong overdue and it\u2019s not happening\novernight. I long for the day in which\ndiscrimination of gender identity and\nsexual orientation is no more. I cannot\nwait for IQ, the Imperial College social\nclub that I represent to become redun-dant: until we are all equal nobody is\nreally equal\u201d.\nHowever the former Archbishop of\nCanterbury Lord Carey agrees with\nArchbishop Sentamu, but goes one\nstep further, declaring \u201c[we] cannot allow this act of cultural and theological\nvandalism to happen\u201d. This view appears to also be backed by an alliance\nof Bishops, Tory MPs and other legal\nfigures. Lord Carey informed press at\nthe launch of Coalition of Marriage\nthat he was worried and disappointed at\nthe Cameron\u2019s move to redefine the nature of marriage. \u201cThe government has\nno mandate from the people to redefine\nmarriage\u201d, he assured, continuing to\nsay his gay friends felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and \u201cexploited\u201d.\nBoth Archbishop Sentamu and Lord\nCarey both put emphasis on the fact\nthat this issue is not about same-sex\nrelationships, the Archbishop stating\n\u201cI support civil partnerships\u201d. The big\nbreakthrough of 2005 gave same-sex\ncouples many of the same rights as heterosexual ones, such as custody of chil-dren, social security, and inheritance.\nHowever currently same-sex couples\ncannot be married in the same sense as\nheterosexual couples.\nBritain seems to be behind the times\nin this respect as for example some\nstates in the US have legalized same-sex marriages. The most recent state to\njoin this group is Washington. Governor Christine Gregoire signed the new\nbill this month, saying, \u201cI\u2019m proud\nour same-sex couples will no longer\nbe treated as separate but equal\u201d. This\ncame about just before the Governor of\nNew Jersey vetoed a bill for the same\ncause, despite it being cleared by the\nstate Senate, renewing a call for a refer-endum. Democrats supporting the bill\nwere disappointed at this move, arguing gay marriage to be a civil right that\nshould not be subject to referendum.\nEven in a country where Christianity has more influence same-sex marriage has been legalized in seven states.\nHowever seven out of the fifty states\nstill shows that there is a long way to go\nin the \u2018land of the free\u2019. Over time the\nUK has become an increasingly secular society, so why should the meaning\nof the word marriage be isolated just\nto that of being between a man and a\nwoman? The meaning of marriage has\nalready changed over time with the\nchanging of society. Previously marriage used to be for status, family honor\nand politics (as pointed out in the letter\nby Selwyn College). Today the majority of people marry because they are\nin love, no matter their religion, race,\nor social background. So why is it that\nsame-sex couples in Britain today cannot do this also?\nArchbishop \u201chides behind banner of preserving\ntradition\u201d over gay marriage statement\n\u201cGay marriage is long\noverdue and it\u2019s not\nhappening overnight\u201d\n...Continued from Front Page\nSelwyn College, Cambridge, gave Archbishop Sentamu\u2019s views a cold reception following his statement\nJames Mottram\n\n"

At the moment, it\u2019s the Republican nominations that are taking up\nvaluable headline space. They are not\ntoo dissimilar to an arrogant, terrible,\nand loud punk-rock band: they shout\nincoherently about how great they are\nwhen all the evidence seems to suggest the opposite. If I\u2019m honest, I think\nthat the Republican field is incredibly\nweek this time around. Even John McCain maybe thinks so: he accidentally\nendorsed Obama and not Romney in\nwhat I can only imagine was a Freudian\nslip. I want to waste your time by immaturely discussing the potential (and\nreal) candidates.\nThis year, some wild cards have been\nthrowing their hats into the ring. There\nwas the brief period when Donald\nTrump looked like he was going to run.\nI can\u2019t imagine him being the people\u2019s\ncandidate, given that he is possibly the\nleast humble and relatable man inAmer-ica. In fact, he\u2019s made some statements\nthat are so incredibly douchey that I almost started assuming irony. Until, with\na sigh, I realised whom I was thinking\nof. Prime example of this is when he\nuttered the phrase: \u201cPart of the beauty\nof me is that I\u2019m very rich\u201d. Replace\n\u201cbeauty\u201d with \u201cfundamental characteristics\u201d and \u201cvery rich\u201d with \u201ca massive\ndickhead\u201d and then the sentence becomes accurate. Sarah Palin threatened\nto run, but, if you ask me, and I guess\nyou sort of unwillingly are if you\u2019re\nreading this, she prefers campaigning\nand celebrity status; she doesn\u2019t seem to\nactually want to do the job, she\u2019d rather\njust complain about how others are.\nThen there was Michelle Bachmann \u2013\nwhose husband allegedly tried to cure\npeople of homosexuality. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t cure himself of stupid-ity, or his wife for that matter. If you\nwant to donate to the \u201cbuy a Bachmann\na brain cell\u201d campaign, please do so by\nbuying me a drink in the Union.\nThe two front-runners, it seems, are\nMitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. So\nfar, it hasn\u2019t been a friendly rivalry.\nThe gloves are so far removed from\ntheir hands that only the Hubble telescope is capable of picturing them. Of\ncourse the attack ad is the embodiment\nof this. It\u2019s now somewhat of a tradi-tion. One ad that particularly caught my\neye was Newt Gingrich\u2019s attack against\nMitt Romney that built up to the shocking truth: \u201cand just like John Kerry\u2026\nhe speaks French\u201d. First of all, this is\nconfusing an ability that could only improve foreign relations with something\nthat is a hindrance. Secondly, and im-portantly, the footage of Mitt Romney\n\u2018speaking French\u2019 consists of Romney\nsaying: \u201cBonjour, je m\u2019appelle Mitt\nRomney\u201d. He\u2019s not exactly discussing\nphilosophy at the Sorbonne now is he?\nWith my extremely limited capability\nat French (my family will fully back\nme up on this) I think I could possibly\nmanage that \u2013 and this is coming from\na person who got a B in GCSE French\nand still thinks the only explanation is\nthat they wrote \u201cU\u201d incorrectly on the\ncertificate.\nRomney is not exactly innocent in\nthis mud slinging match. On his website there is a whole section of videos\ntitled \u201cunreliable leader\u201d. At first, I\nthought that this was the first incidence\nof someone making attack ads against\nA weak Republican field\nthemselves. It turns out they are all referencing Gingrich.\nThis is just the foreplay though; the\nmain event is still to come. The big race\nto the White House isn\u2019t in full swing\nyet (we would all definitely know if it\nhad as it would be impossible to miss).\nThere\u2019s one issue that continues to bug\nme about the US electoral system, besides some of the candidates. It\u2019s the\nsmall point of how the votes are counted\nand how the election result is decided. I\ncan understand why you would have a\nSenate and a House in which each state\nlocally elects someone to go and sit for\nthem. (Although, I should hasten to\nnote, there is still the argument that it\nshouldn\u2019t be this way and that proportional representation is a better system,\nbut that\u2019s a different debate.) However,\nI cannot understand why, when electing the President, they have the points\nsystem whereby each state has different points and everything\u2019s muddled\nand weird. It basically ends up meaning\nsomeone in one state will have a more\nimportant say than someone in another\nstate. Why not have it just as whoever\ngets the most votes wins? That\u2019s simple\nand democratic. When I think of the\nsystem they have in place, I feel like\nI\u2019m in a lecture where some maths is\ninvolved: I understand the how, but the\nwhy is still a bit of a mystery. In fact,\nthat\u2019s sometimes the feeling I get when\nI think about how any politicians got\ninto their positions of power.\nHave Newt\nand Mitt\nunfairly made\nan attack\nad about\nyour hidden\ntalent? Tell\nus about it:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nNah dude I swear it\u2019s THIIIIS big. As if your policy is that all encompassing\nThis year\u2019s Summer Ball is set to see all\nthe fun of the fair, figuratively and finan-cially, following the wise and not entirely\nunexpected decision to revert to a more\ntraditional event than last year.\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\nMichael Foster announced the latest\nplans (to bring back a black tie dress\ncode and the option of a sit down formal\ndinner) at a meeting of Imperial College\nUnion Council on Monday 13 February.\nThe event is set to be held on Saturday\n23 June. A preliminary budget has been\napproved, the current plan will be taken\nto the Finance & Risk Sub-Committee\nof the Union\u2019s Trustee Board, and any\nchanges will be reviewed by the Union\u2019s\nExecutive Committee. Steps are clearly\nbeing taken to ensure that the event is\nless susceptible to financial risk and\nloss.\nThe paper suggested that students\nshould be involved \u201cat all levels\u201d. The aim\nof this appears to be to gain the atten-tion, and raise the expectations, of the\nstudent body, in addition with increasing\nthe transparency of the event itself. Currently, it appears to be working. Other\nthan speculation over budget changes\nand an increase to proposed ticket prices (between \u00a325 and \u00a330 for entertainments only and between \u00a35 and \u00a37 for\nthe after party) immediate feedback to\nthe plans has been positive.\nThis is sensible, and in ways inevita-ble. Taking a risk on this year\u2019s Summer\nBall would have been wholly illogical. The\ndebate and conversation that emerged\nafter the controversial decision to have\nlast year\u2019s Summer Ball take the format\nof a festival with no compulsory formal-wear was widespread. Any risk of fostering further discontent is something that\nideally must be quashed.\nAt this moment in time, and with no\nfully concrete plans in place, it is hard\nto argue about what potential improvements could be made. That is to say, shy\nof an open bar (it has, after all, been a\nlong time since the heady days of a \u00a31\npint). Some have suggested one main\nheadliner to cut down on the cost of various artists across stages, though two\nmain acts on two stages with support\nis also a decent choice. The decision to\ntake a more reserved standpoint on the\nrunning of this year\u2019s event is for all intents and purposes, following last year,\nfar wiser than persisting with something\nthat breaks drastically from tradition.\nCrowdpleasing is the name of the\ngame all around. There is still some time\nuntil the main event, but the signs look\npromising. Tentative, but promising.\nStill Summer Ballin\u2019\nTim Arbabzadah\nDonald Trump...\nmade some\nstatements that\nare so incredibly\ndouchey that I\nalmost started\nassuming irony\n\u201c\nDonald\nDonald\nmade s\nmade s\nted\nted\nony\nony\nToo much burgundy?\nEmail address spanning\ntwo lines annoying?\nEmail: comment.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Enough for two ramekins.\nIngredients:\nThe filling:\n1 cup blueberries\n2 tsp vodka\n2 tsp all purpose flour\n2 tsp sugar\n1 tsp lemon juice (optional)\n\u00bd tsp lemon zest (optional)\nThe biscuit:\n\u00bd cup all purpose flour\n90ml cold milk\n1 tsp baking powder\n3 tbsp cold butter cut in small squares\n1 tsp sugar\nA pinch of salt\nPreheat your oven at 190\u00b0C.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine all the filling ingredients but be careful not to mash the blueber-ries. Place the filling in two ramekins. It should\nbe enough to fill 3 quarters of each ramekin.\nIn a separate mixing bowl, combine the flour\nwith the baking powder, the sugar and the\nsalt. The butter should be cut in small square\npieces and it should be very cold. This will ensure that the biscuit will have a good texture.\nMix the butter with the flour mixture but be careful\nnot to overmix. If you overmix then the biscuit will\nbe very hard. The milk should be cold and this helps\nto achieve the required texture. Add the milk slowly into the mixture. Again be careful not to overmix.\nPlace the biscuit batter on top of the blueberries\nand brush with milk. In a tray put some foil and then\nplace the ramekins on top. This will ensure that your\ntray does not get dirty from the blueberry juices.\nPlace it in your oven and bake for about 15\nminutes or until the biscuit is golden brown.\nNote that this recipe could be made with almost\nany kind of fruit that you have in your fridge. It is\ngreat made with apples or bananas or strawberries\nbut my personal favourite is the blueberry cobbler.\nA great dessert to share!\nYiango Mavrocostanti\nveggiewiz.blogspot.com\nH\nannah and Clare are two real\nfoodies who have become\nvegan for a month to raise\nmoney for the Multiple Sclerosis Trust. They\u2019ve decided\nto make the most of this opportunity and are\non a quest to find really good vegan food.\nFollow their progress in their weekly column\nto see if they really can find vegan food that\nsatisfies the meat-eaters among us.\nHannah\u2019s Cheap and Easy Vegan Mediterranean Couscous \u2013 serves 1\nIngredients\n70g giant couscous\nDrizzle of olive oil\n1 crushed clove of garlic\n1 courgette\n1 can of chopped tomatoes\n\u00bd teaspoon of sugar\n1 medium red onion\nPinch of salt\n1. Fry couscous (2mins) in oil or until golden brown, before covering in water (approx.\ntwo times the volume of couscous) and boil\nuntil soft.\n2. Chop onion into chunks, sweat in oil until\nsoft. Chop courgette into chunks and add to\nonions along with the crushed garlic.\n3. Drain chopped tomatoes and add to veg-etables.\n4. Add sugar and season before cooking until\npiping hot.\n5. Mix in soft giant couscous and serve.\nThis was the first week of our vegan challenge to raise money for the MS Trust. Although we were dreading it, we secretly\nhoped that this new lifestyle would make us\nfeel healthier, slimmer and happier; so far\nit\u2019s been a bit of an uphill struggle.\nAlthough it\u2019s been tough, we have discovered the delicious Bear Granola Nibbles\nsold in SAF (the tropical crunch flavour is\nparticularly good). They serve as a really\ngood snack to satisfy our food cravings, and\non the back of this we thought we\u2019d sample\nsome snacky dessert delights. In Wholefoods we bought a \u201cBanoffee Cream\u201d Tart\nand a Banana Walnut \u201cChocolate\u201d Chip\niced cupcake. To be honest both would be\ntopped by a good hobnob, but if we had to\npick one it would be the \u201cBanoffee Cream\u201d\nTart. It\u2019s fresh, creamy and would be satisfying for any sweet tooth. On the down side\nwe don\u2019t like that we can\u2019t figure out what\nthe \u201ccreamy\u201d topping is made from, and to\nbe honest there\u2019s an overriding sense that the\nwhole thing is artificial.\nFor now our quest to find amazing vegan\nfood is still ongoing. Tune in next week! For\nnow we\u2019re off to make a cup of tea (with\nsoya milk of course), and remember this is\nall for the MS Trust so please sponsor us\nat uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/go-ingvegan.\nFirst week dish for the vegans. Alternatively, visit Gaucho for a juicy steak\nApologies to Clare and Hannah...\ndients, nothing too complicated.\nThe preparation of the meal is quick and\nvery simple. Chop the vegetables, fry them for\na few minutes in olive oil, add the mince and\nany herbs that you like (salt, pepper, paprika,\ncumin etc) and fry until the meat is cooked.\nThen add the tomato sauce and wait until\nYou have finished lectures, you have just returned home and you are starving. The worst\nthing is that you\u2019re sick of eating fast food,\nbut you don\u2019t have that much experience with\ncooking.\nRelax, this article is dedicated to you! There\nare a lot of simple recipes, even for those of\nyou who have little time to go to the supermarket and prepare your meals. And the most\nimportant thing is that these recipes have a\nlow budget and will save you a significant\namount of money if you make them often.\nRemember, the secret of success in cooking\nis to be creative, so let\u2019s get our hands dirty\nand try the following dishes. I call the first\none the \u201cEasy Choice\u201d. The usual ingredients\nare some tomato sauce, an onion, a tomato,\nsome parsley, a lemon, pita bread and as much\nmince as you like. Cheap and common ingre-it is absorbed by the meat. At the end, add\nsome parsley and lemon and enjoy this delicious mixture in a pitta bread, as shown in the\npicture. You may find this recipe very helpful\nif you have some meat left in the fridge, or if\nyou have small portions of various different\nmeat and vegetables that you don\u2019t know how\nto combine.\nThe second recipe has as prerequisites a few\npotatoes, one or two tomatoes and an egg. Cut\nthe potatoes into small pieces and fry them.\nRemove the oil from the pan, chop the tomatoes into small pieces and add them to the pan\nwith the potatoes.\nFinally, add the egg and wait until you get\nan even mixture (this should take only a few\nminutes). Add some salt and pepper, and your\nmeal is ready! See? Cooking is easier than\nyou think. Just give it a try, let your creativity shine and remember that practice makes\nperfect.\nClare Cheng and Hannah Cox have survived the first\nfive days of their quest in veganism\nVegan Diary: Week One\nGet creative in the kitchen after lectures\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nBlood-red cobblers with a touch of booze\n\n"

This event is the most\npopular student archery competition on the\ncalendar and this year was no exception with a\nnew record of over 520 entrants descending on\nthe Telford International Centre.\nDespite the early start of 8:15am, all 14 members travelling to the competition were in good\nspirit and looking forward to the day ahead.\nNormally, whenever theArchery Club travels\nwe get quizzical looks from passers by because\nof our large unwieldy bags with long arrow\ntubes sticking out of them. This year however,\nafter the walk from the station to the International Centre in the pouring rain, the team was\ngreeted by the the MCM Expo happening at the\nsame time in the other hall at the centre.\nThe first session of the day was running late,\nso this gave a good distraction for those with\ncameras, and the entire team was (perhaps too)\nexcited to see at least 7 people in Stormtrooper\noutfits.\nAt least we all seemed fairly normal.\nThe standard indoor round for student archery competitions (termed a Portsmouth)\ninvolves shooting 60 arrows towards a 60cm\ndiameter target face at a distance of 20 yards\n(18m), giving a maximum possible score of\n600. At BUCS indoors, each archer is given 2\nminutes to shoot the 3 arrows of an end. These\nare then scored and totalled, the whole process\nbeing repeated 20 times.\nHannah Beasley-Suffolk, a first year bio-chemist, took the gold medal in the ladies senior recurve category, fending off the challenges from archers of Edinburgh, Birmingham and\nNottingham universities.\nSPORT\nFELIX\nFriday 24 february 2012\n38\nWeb: www3.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nFacebook: Search \u2018Sport Imperial\u2019\nTwitter: @SportImperial\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editor: Indy Leclercq\nThe winning score of 573 with 60 hits and\n35 golds was a full 7 points clear of the nearest\nchallengers. Her round was exciting too; there\nwas a nerve racking moment when Hannah\ndidn\u2019t realise it was her turn to shoot, resulting\nin having to shoot 3 arrows in just 40 seconds.\nThankfully records officer Adam Holliday realised this, saved the day and Hannah was still\nable to put in a 10-9-9 end!\nThere was yet more drama at this year\u2019s indoor championships for the Imperial team than\never before.\nAn unfortunate moment of tiredness for\nequipments officer Richard Yim meant that he\nwas unable to shoot his third arrow within the\ntime limit, which resulted in a zero scored for\nthat arrow.\nCaptain Jonathan Hutt also managed a moment of panic when he reached the target and\nthought he had only shot two arrows in one end.\nThe crisis was averted when he realised that it\nwas just a soft part of the target and his arrow\nhad passed nearly all the way through!Despite\nthe drama that occurred throughout the shoot,\nboth team scores were also good.\nThe senior team (Hannah Beasley-Suffolk,\nRichard Yim, Jonathan Hutt and Stephen\nWood) came 9th out of 43 with a cumulative\nscore of 2183 and the novice team (Ben Hou,\nYun Shi and Cassie Epps) came 20th out of 36\nwith a score of 1270.\nAll in all it was a fun and eventful day, and\nthe club is now looking forward to several open\ncompetitions in the next few weeks, as well as\nthe British University Team Championships\n(BUTC) taking place in Coventry on Saturday\n10th March.\nLater in the year we also have the BUCS\noutdoor championships; this is always a good\nweekend spent outdoors camping and shooting\nand we are again hopeful of good results.\nLike Legolas, but without the pointy\nears\nDon\u2019t mess with them \u2013 those smiling faces hide some deadly marksmanship\nIC Archery\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nFELIX Friday 24 February 2012 37\nSport Editor: Indy Leclercq\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s actually getting pretty tough to remember how many polo nationals I\u2019ve\nbeen to these days. However, this year,\nwith a new venue in the Midlands, we\nwere expecting something a bit different\nand a bit special. With some stunning\nnew club shirts courtesy of the extremely generous Rydges Hotel Kensington\nand the attached Polo Bar on Gloucester\nRoad we felt confident that we were going to at least look the part; with marginally more practice as a team this year\nthan on previous occasions we had fingers crossed for a strong finish.\nWith the expense and the requirement\nfor time off of college it\u2019s often pretty\ntricky to get people to commit to the\nevent, but this year we managed to pull\ntogether a lower intermediate team for\nthe third nationals in a row. By combining our weight with Oxford Brookes\n(who train at the same school as us) we\nmanaged to twist a couple of beginners\narms enough to make them play in a\nmixed team as well.\nEarly on the morning of the 9th of\nFebruary we converged on Euston sta-tion, with Miss Sheena Cowell meeting\nme early for what she termed \u201cmoral\nsupport\u201d as I lugged the club kit across\nLondon. My teammate and club chair\nMikaela Bryant-Meisner and other newbie Miffy Oliver showed uncharacteristic punctuality and we all managed to\ncollect our tickets and board the 08:45 to\nRugby without issue. None of us envied\nfinal teammate and polo stalwart Jon\nMatthews\u2019 decision to drive his motorbike up rather than joining us.\nIn true SUPA style, despite rocking up\nwith hours to spare before our first match\neverything had changed by the time we\narrived. Miffy and Sheena would now\nbe split playing between 2 mixed teams\ninvolving themselves, Oxford Brookes\nand RVC and the ensuing confusion was\nan excellent source of stress for the 4\nor 5 people in charge of various different things for the rest of the weekend.\nAs it turns out the first chukka (match)\nof the tournament would involve Miffy\nand two equally confused compatriots\nfrom Oxford Brookes. The scratch team,\nnever having played together, did well\nto hold their own and Miffy managed to\nscore the goal that kept them to a slim\ndefeat at 2-1. Later on, it became apparent that the match had been recorded as\na draw rather than a loss, a mistake we\nweren\u2019t complaining about.\nLater that afternoon Sheena and Miffy\ngot the chance to play together for the\nfirst time; they had been bumped up a\ndivision from the relatively slow Beginner 3 section to the much more viciously contested Beginner 2s and a\nteam of West Country thugs from UWE.\nThe UWE lads had just the testosterone\nlevel required to play at what was arguably a dangerous pace for riders of that\nlevel and the muscle to bully their way\naround the pitch. Despite some obvious\nfouls they clearly had the better of the\nBrookes/Imperial combo. Regardless of\nwhat some might call a whooping the\ngirls both claimed they enjoyed the opportunity to play at the faster pace. That\nsaid, they barely had time to take it in\nas their next chukka, another Beginner 2\nmatch, came up pretty quickly.\nPlaying with a slightly different team\nyet again we had to cross our fingers that\nthe girls would manage to gel quickly\nand come away with a strong result. In\na scrappier but less one-sided match we\nlooked on with cheers of encouragement and advice. Sheena, not wanting\nto be outdone by the younger Myfanwy,\nlooked set to get her goal tally off the\nmark as well but her consistent hitting\nand well-timed run left her just wide of\nthe mark to get the equaliser. However,\nyou can never quite rely on your pony to\nbe entirely on your team and an unfortunate ricochet from an opposing pony\u2019s\nleg finished the job Sheena started as the\nmatch ended in a draw.\nAfter this the confusion really set in.\nThe snow started coming down and the\npony providers and tournament officials\nstarted looking at moving chukkas from\nother days. Hungry, cold and tired it\ntook quite a while for us to figure out\nthat Sheena would have one more chukka that night, the final one of the day.\nWith the addition of Steff from RVC\nand Sam from Oxford Brookes, the girls\nmade for a strong team and came away\nwith a runaway victory.\nWith the way the draw worked this\nyear our teams all got Friday off so we\nsettled in for a long night at the pub followed by drinks in our rooms. There\nwas some pretty excellent food at the\nB&B, a lot of drunken banter with\nBrookes (which somehow resulted in us\nowning the Brookes Polo T-Shirts) and\nmore rum, gin, vodka, wine, beer and\ncider than I care to admit to. After an\nextremely lazy day, Friday night saw us\nslightly more sedate at our instructor JJ\nSpark\u2019s 40th birthday party. Needless to\nsay the B&B staff were not polo\u2019s biggest fans by the end of the evening, and\nwith our Lower Intermediate team set to\nplay against Brookes first thing in the\nmorning the quest to leave each other\nin a worse state in the morning provided\nsome additional amusement.\nThe stress of the morning hit new\nheights when a lorry breakdown meant\nour horses arrived late and we took to\nthe field significantly later than our opponents only to realise that one horse\nhad taken a knock in the lorry and was\nlimping too much to play. A desperate\nswap to another unknown pony left us\nready to play our training partners and\nMikaela, Jon and I got stuck in and were\nsurprised to find ourselves 1-0 up early\non. Georgie, Charlie and Tess were on\nform though and a close fought match\nensued with Brookes keeping us at bay\nand with a goal from Jon the buzzer\nwent with the score at 2 all. Needing a\nresult the match went to penalties and\ntaking the first one from 15 yards despite a smoothly hit shot my attempt hit\nthe boards just to the side of the goal\nand Georgie Haycraft\u2019s level head and\nincreased experience sent us into the\nlower half of the knockout. Our second match saw us pitted against 3 girls\nfrom Nottingham. We\u2019d been on a high\nduring the Brookes match, working as\na team, lots of good natured yelling at\none another and pretty relaxed given\nwe were playing some familiar faces.\nThis didn\u2019t last and our communication\nstarted to fall apart in a scrappy match\nending one apiece. Jon got his chance to\nmake me feel slightly better about missing a penalty during the match and so\nthe resulting sudden death penalty fell\nto Mikaela\u2026 unfortunately, this was the\nsecond match we lost on penalties. Very\nBritish \u2013 well, except Mikaela.\nWe were all pretty ready to drown our\nsorrows and fortunately SUPAwere well\nprepared for us with a fancy dress party\nset to start at 9pm. As a white knight, his\nfaithful steed, an evil dragon and a damsel in distress we were continuing the\nvery British vibe. However, for all you\nfreshers out there, a warning as to the\ndangers of pre-drinks. If you pass out on\nthe bed in a onsie before the party you\nare likely to earn yourself the nickname\n\u201cDrunken Dragon\u201d or something much\nless forgiving and less printable. Things\ngot pretty messy from that point and our\nwhite knight totally failed to protect our\nPonies, snow and a broken jaw at polo nationals\nPolo\nAlex Savell\ndamsel in distress from falling over and\nmanaged to lose his faithful steed and\nroommate (who had the keys) at some\npoint during the evening.After a confus-ing, and in some cases extremely hungover morning we were just about ready\nto look at getting on ponies.\nOur rematch against Notts did not\ngo great; a strong game plan from the\nNottingham girls left us unable to really\nimpact the game as we wanted and one\nslightly lucky backhand to score was the\nonly consolation in an otherwise very\none-sided match. The 2 chukka final of\nthe B3 was hard-fought and fast. Despite Sheena managing to finally get her\ngoal tally off to a proper start and both\nplayers saying it was one of their highlights of the weekend the girls had to\nsettle for second place. The LIs, on the\nother hand, were in the running for the\nwooden spoon against ULU, one more\ngrudge match to conclude.\nThings didn\u2019t get off to a great start.\nLeft waiting in the warm up arena, we\ntrotted around, until in a moment of extreme intelligence Bumble decided that\n4 legs were too many to keep track of\nand proceeded to trip over them. I took\nan unceremonious tumble while a confused looking Bumble clambered back\nto his feet entirely unaffected. Things\ndidn\u2019t get a great deal better on the\npitch; us against ULU is always pretty\nphysical and this wasn\u2019t any different.\nLots of fouls, lots of ride-offs, lots of\naction \u2013 inevitably, injuries happen. A\nstray elbow connected with Jon\u2019s jaw\ncausing an impressively swollen tongue\nand what turned out to be a fracture.\nAll in all the clearly talented beginners\ncame out of the tournament with hangovers and exhaustion as scars, whereas\nthe club chair Mikaela managed to come\nout of the LI tournament unscathed\nand we expect her to proudly carry the\nwooden spoon home. Still, some silver\nash trays, a good time, Jon lost for words\nand the summer nationals yet to come;\nI\u2019ll take that.\nThere\u2019s nothing My Little Pony about this\nClassy outfits for a classy sport (no, that was not a class-based joke)\n\n"

The Fairtrade\nFoundation also sets a cap on the minimum selling price of the products. This\nensures that the farmers\u2019 labours will always bring in enough money to sustain\ntheir families and communities. This\nis not true for non-Fairtrade producers\nwho have to work for zilch in famine or\nwhen demand and subsequently selling\nprice drops to nothing, meaning not being able to make ends meet.\nAnother example is that health and\nsafety must be enforced to ensure that\nmachinery is handled correctly and the\ndangers are known. Specific hazardous\nmaterials are also banned to ensure the\nsafety of workers, while environmentally sustainable and natural methods in\nfarming are promoted.\nOn top of ensuring that producers are\nnot being ripped off, the Fairtrade Foundation invests into a community fund to\nbe spent democratically by cooperatives\nin the area on schools, clean water, new\nroads etc.\nMost people nod and agree that\nFairtrade is the right way to conduct\nbusiness, but are worried that being ethical means that your wallet has to suffer.\nThis is an untrue myth: 100g of coffee\nhas the standard price of \u00a32.68 while the\naverage Fairtrade price is \u00a32.50 while a\npack of 8 bananas typically costs \u00a31.38,\nFairtrade bananas cost \u00a31.15.

Coming\nup tomorrow (Saturday 25 February) is\none of our biggest events of the year,\nour Metric Night: Let it Rain.\nGetting people involved in a charity\nis never easy, not least because it usually involves asking people to give you\nmoney and get nothing in return! This\nis why it is becoming more and more\nwidespread for charities to mix music\nand charity. Listen to good music while\nhelping children in third-world countries \u2013 what more could you possibly\nask for?\nFor tomorrow\u2019s Metric Night, Raincatcher has invited several notable artists to perform live. Space Heroes of the\nPeople, for example, are guaranteed to\nliven up our event with nothing but a\ndouble bass, some random drumming\nand their charming voices inspired by\n(quote) modern architecture, medieval\nhistory and soviet science fiction!\nWe\u2019ll be having in-house acts as well,\nby performers from within Imperial\nCollege including acoustic performers\nCarmay Lin and Edward Myung, our\nrock guitarist and singer Oli Clipsham\nMatthew Murchie\nRaincatcher Imperial hosts a night at Metric in the name of charity\nRaincatcher Imperial took over Metric last year as well\nL\nast Saturday, I went with\nmy housemate to watch\nSolemates, the event put\non by Singapore Society.\nI had never been to any\nof their events before and didn\u2019t really\nknow what to expect. I found a packed\nGreat Hall, which had been converted\ninto a theatre. The first thing that hit me\nwas the Great Hall could actually be\nused for things other than exams.\nThe show started with a couple of\nvideos and then the two hosts came\non. They were genuinely funny, got the\ncrowd in a good mood, and really set\nthe tone for the evening.\nThe main event took the form of a\nmusical complete with a live band behind the sets. The basic story was a re-imagination of the classic Cinderella\nstory. The hero is the quiet, sensitive,\nand obedient Umber Ella (Bennett Tan).\nHis two loud, obnoxious twin brothers\nalways boss him about and make him\ndo their chores. To add to his woes, his\nfather doesn\u2019t let him go to the ball,\nwhere he\u2019d hoped to meet the princess.\nHis Fairy Godfather (played by the brilliant Lei Ting Wei) comes to his rescue\nby helping him and his mop go to the\nball. There he loses his shoe, in a comically over done way. The princess finds\nhim by using the smell of his feet, and\nthey are united.\nThe script was injected with humour,\nand managed to pull off the boy gets\ngirl ending without being too cheesy.\nThe comedic aspects of the show were\npulled off with ease, certainly no awkward \u201cpause for applause that doesn\u2019t\ncome\u201d were in sight. One part I particularly enjoyed was when during a dance\nsequence something is knocked over.\nThen, right at the end, the workers are\nfixing the table \u2013 it was a call-back that\neveryone appreciated and didn\u2019t really\nexpect. All of comic relief characters\nwere on point \u2013 the audience certainly\nseemed to think so as well. The twin\nbrothers always got a laugh for there\nback and forth exchanges. I think that\nthe Fairy Godfather was probably my\nfavourite though. In the words of one\nperson I talked to after: \u201cI\u2019ve never\nheard someone talk Singlish so fluently\u201d. Luckily for me, there was a guide\nto Singlish included. That\u2019s not to take\naway from the main character, who successfully portrayed the shy, everyman\ncharacter that you were rooting for.\nThe dance routines were all sleek and\nwell-rehearsed, and looked quite com-plicated. Admittedly, my dancing experience consists of drunkenly waving my\nhands slightly, but still, it was impres-sive. The singing was all pretty good as\nwell. I would reserve special praise to\nEsther Chan, who played Mop and had\na great voice.\nAt the end of the night, when the cast\nand production team all took a group\nphoto, you really get a sense of how\nmany people are involved in this. Having tried before to organise a group of\nfriends to meet up at a certain time in\na certain place, I can appreciate how\nmuch of a headache it is to get people\ntogether.\nThe show had two directors, Jaren\nSoo and Yap Chinhua. They seemed to\nrelish the opportunity to be involved\nin something so large. Yap Chinhua\nsaid: \u201cThe opportunity I was given to\nfreely create a little world in which the\nstory and the characters inhabited was\namazing. There was much excitement\nwithin the individual teams \u2013 dance,\nchorale, acting, logistics, music, lights\nand sound \u2013 but it was the final synthesis and pulling together that I really enjoyed.\u201d He made sure to point out that\nthe show took a lot of effort. \u201cIt was\nalmost magical, but there was actually\nno magic, only hard work and the sheer\ndesire to create everything from nothing.\u201d He then went on to say why the\nshow is so important to the society: \u201cthe\nmusical \u2013 an imperative component of\nour events calendar \u2013 allowed us Singaporeans to come together, to move and\nbreathe with one aim. It created what\nour Society holds dear- a home away\nfrom home.\u201d\nAt the very end, outside, they gave\nout some snacks and a free beer. A lot\nof people remained outside Sherfield\nto talk, and overall I went home happy\nand impressed that a group of people\ndoing this in their spare time could\ncome up with something as polished as\nit was.\nSingapore Society\u2019s Solemates\nTim Arbabzadah goes to the Great Hall for something that isn\u2019t an exam\nI would photoshop a love heart, but that may be hard to justify to my supervisor in terms of time well spent...\nImperial College Singapore Society\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX\nFriday 24 february 2012\n32\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

He believes\nin the justice system, he has respect for\nthe police force and the work they do, he\nis passionate about arresting the scums\nof L.A., and he appears to be a family\nman with two children he is dedicated\nin taking care of. For him, slightly\nbending and sometimes outright breaking the law is absolutely fine, as long as\nhe has a justifiable goal. He is the kind\nof cop who would beat someone half\nto death to get some vital information.\nCops could get away with this kind of\nmindset but in the 1990\u2019s, the infamous\nRampart scandal was shaking up the\nL.A. police department, with corrupt\ncops being discharged and attracting\na lot of embarrassment and negative\npress attention to the police force.\nCaught in the middle of this chaos is\nthe equally chaotic and volatile Brown,\nwhose stubborn, crime-fighting nature\nrefuses to tone down despite the scrutiny his occupation is under. One day\nhe chases and beats up a man who accidentally crashed into his car and tried to\nflee, and his rampage with his police baton ends up getting caught on a civilian\ncamera. The video and his name are all\nacross the evening news later that day,\nand attracts even more protest, something his powerful bosses, trying their\nabsolute best to survive the aftermath of\nthe Rampart scandal, are furious about.\nHis professional life is therefore in\njeopardy, with Internal Affairs (Weav-er, Buscemi) wanting to bury this case\nfrom the public by getting rid of Brown\nas swiftly as possible.\nThings at home aren\u2019t much bet-ter. The two women (Heche, Nixon),\nwho happen to be sisters, who Brown\neach fathered a daughter with, have\nkicked him out of their house and he is\nnot a welcome member at their dinner\ntable, despite his desire to bond with\nthis daughters (who are incidentally,\nboth cousins and sisters). His domestic life consists of lazing around his\ncouch, watching television, drinking\nbeer and endlessly smoking. He needs\nhis job more than ever to remain sane\nDirector Oren Moverman\nScreenwriters James Ellroy, Oren\nMoverman\nCast Woody Harrelson, Sigourney\nWeaver, Robin Wright, Steve\nBuscemi\nRampart\nJohn Park\nand have some sort of purpose in life.\nBeing targeted as a sacrificial lamb by\nhis employees at this point in his life is\neven less welcoming, and Brown is not\nwilling to go down without a fight. A\nlegal battle ensues in which he tries to\nnot only clear his name, but also keep\nhis job.\nBut luck is most certainly not on his\nside. Even when he is trying to lay low\nand correct some of the mistakes he has\nmade, he somehow ends up making his\nsituation worse, with his life further\nspiraling out of control. Brown may\nnot be a likable character at first, due\nto his shockingly impulsive and violent\nbehaviour, and the fact that very little\nis told about him prior to a lot of these\nhectic events also don\u2019t help the audience trying to understand this man. But\nthe superb Harrelson is able to do wonders with his surprisingly underwritten\nmain character. A highly underrated actor who sails through different genres\nwith competence and ease, the versatile\nHarrelson is a tour-de-force in capturing Brown\u2019s hardships and his daily\nintimate struggle to please everyone\naround him.\nDespite the fiery nature of its plot,\nRampart chooses to linger in many long\ntakes and carefully observe Brown\u2019s every single thought and movement. This,\ncombined with Harrelson\u2019s intense per-formance, is an exceptional character\nstudy that truly draws you in to this fascinating tale of someone hitting rock-bottom. Just as you thought it could not\nget any worse for Brown, it does, in the\nmost unfortunate way imaginable, and\nwe start to wonder whether his life will\never turn around. Although it would be\nfair to assume that he himself played\na part in this mess, given all the tough\nhoops he is required to jump through,\nwe begin to wonder if the punishment\nfits the crime.\nIt doesn\u2019t have much else to tell outside the central character\u2019s plot which\nin itself is also greatly restrained, and\nbecause of this, the talented range of\nsupporting actors are merely treated as\nnothing but slightly long cameo roles.\nWeaver and Buscemi shine in their brief\nscene they share with Harrelson, Heche\nand Nixon are both suitably cranky and\ndissatisfied with their children\u2019s father\u2019s\nirresponsible string of actions. Robin\nWright has an interesting role as a mysterious lawyer who might or might not\nbe after Brown. But the real star here\nis Harrelson, playing a conflicted man\nin a complicated movie, in a raw, brave\nperformance with a touch of priceless\ndark comedy here and there that shows\nHarrelson yet again on top form.\nEnjoying a nice cup of coffee - a luxury most actors can\u2019t afford on set but...to heck with it, I\u2019m Woody Harrelson!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 24 february 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nA\nre women unhappy\nat Imperial? Some, it\nseems, are. Some men\nare too. Whether these\nare vocal fractions of a\nsilent majority, or simply a vocal minority remains to be seen, but it doesn\u2019t\nreally matter. Every student at Imperial\ndeserves freedom to be him/herself and\nto thrive to his/her full potential, minority or not \u2013 and women at Imperial are\na minority. Within the central Union we\ndo a lot of work for many of the recognised minorities but have done little\nrecently for women.\nHistorically we have had a women\u2019s\nofficer, women\u2019s society, and a women\nonly social space, but as time wore on\nand gender parity drew ever nearer,\nwork on women\u2019s rights fell by the\nwayside, replaced by newer, fresher\ncampaigns. Perhaps we stopped fighting for gender equality because we\nthought the battle was won, or perhaps\nmembers of the Union became convinced that the stereotypical burning-bra-brandishing brand of feminism\ncould gain little traction at Imperial and\nthus discarded it, failing to replace it\nwith an equally passionate but different\ncoloured effort through oversight. Either way, the Union slowly let the feminist narrative slip further and further\ndown the agenda. I imagine it is easy\nto become complacent and to believe\nthat women are represented and catered\nfor when Women in Science EngineerI have a smartphone: progress at last\nEveryone deserves to be happy here\ning and Technology (WSET), winners\nof President\u2019s Award in 2010, are so\nblazingly successful in their every en-deavour, forgetting that WSET in fact\nhas defined a very narrow if extremely\nvalid scope of operation for itself and\nnever endeavoured to address many\nof the issues that affect many women\ndaily. As a result we now have no feminine voice on campus. Traditionally this\nvoice would have found itself through,\nfirst the Women\u2019s Officer and then the\nGender Equalities officer. For whatever\nreason, this mechanism is not currently\neffective, as recent articles in Felix have\nbrought to blinding light.\nWe recently gained access to the data\nfrom the Student Experience Survey\ncarried out in October. On first glance\nit appears that 10.2% (382/3763) of un-dergrads, 3.5% (28/792) of PG-Taught\nand 7.9% (21/267) of PG-Research\nstudents answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to \u2018Do you\nfeel [your gender has] affected the\nquality of your experience at Imperial\nnegatively?\u2019. There are many ways this\ncould be interpreted as we do not yet\nknow whether it was women or men\nwho felt their experience had been com-promised; but for now, all we can say\n(and rest assured the breakdowns will\nbe shared as soon as we have them) is\nthat 10% of undergraduate students feel\ntheir experience has been negatively affected by their gender \u2013 and this is un-acceptable. The College is taking this\nvery seriously.\nI\nrecently joined the twenty-first\ncentury and got a new phone.\nActually, that\u2019s not quite ac-curate. As well as servicing my\ntelecommunicative needs, it also\nhas a whole array of shiny doodads\nand gizmos. It has a camera with the\nresolution to individually identify the\nhairs in Karl Marx\u2019s beard from across\na crowded dinner party. Its GPS is so\nprecise it even knows when I\u2019m standing on one leg in the middle of the Sahara (sadly though, not in Fulham for\nsome reason). It is capable of posting to\nFacebook and Twitter so I don\u2019t have to\nbe near a computer to be vain or inane\nanymore. On top of this, it has a veritable host of apps, each more pointless\nthan the last. I can even phone people\nwith it... though I haven\u2019t quite worked\nout how yet.\nI am amazed that what would have\nbeen a supercomputer thirty years ago\ncan now nestle down in my trousers.\nAlthough it makes for a rather dubious\nchat-up line, I had resisted the electromagnetic pull of new technology up\nuntil this point. Admittedly, this new\ndevice throws off enough energy to\ngive me leg cancer even when it\u2019s in my\nother trousers, but my main reason to\ncoyly refuse previous techno-advances\nwas my belief that a phone should be a\nphone and just that.\nThis fear of the future, of change, of\nthe unfamiliar, is only so clich\u00e9 because\nit is so ancient. Scrape away all the gadgets and pretty colours and the scene\nhasn\u2019t changed much since pre-history,\nwhen a prognathic ancestor of Steve\nJobs brought tablets back to the cave.\nHis friends must have looked at him as\nif he\u2019d been at the red berries.\n\u201cLook, friends! The age of the tablet\nhas arrived.\u201d\n\u201cBut what does it do?\u201d (Thousands of\nyears on, and this conversation proves\nthat history does indeed repeat itself)\n\u201cBefore you could only etch your pre-expressionist imaginings on the cave\nwall but this is a piece of wall you can\ntake with you. You can show all your\nfriends!\u201d\n\u201cBut all my friends are in the cave!\u201d\n\u201cThis is for when they\u2019re not!\u201d\nImpressed awe all around as people\ncame around to the idea of mobile com-munications. Words came later, much\nmore gradually, as people got worse at\ndrawing and their scribbles looked less\nand less like what they were supposed\nto. Compare Egyptian hieroglyphs with\nGreek lettering, and look at what passes\nfor the Greek constellations \u2013 Egyptian\nconstellations were the ancient equivalent of a Flickr album.\nAlthough impressionism waned, innovation soared as the scroll was intro-duced. Thus, the ancient world learned\nthat things didn\u2019t have to weigh four\ntonnes and need a wheelbarrow to move\n\u2013 aesthetics, ergonomics, and compactness \u2013 a lesson we only remembered\nin the nineties. A few hundred years\nlater and the book appeared, shortly followed by the bookmark, a quantum leap\nin user interface.\nAt the turn of the last century, or\nThe Union has a duty to ensure all\nstudents it represents have freedom\nof speech and freedom from harm. If\nstudents do not feel comfortable expressing feminist (or any) perspectives,\nsomething has gone very wrong. If\nwomen do not feel represented and supported in our current system, something\nhas gone very wrong. It is difficult for a\nstudent who does not feel empowered\nto develop into everything he/she can\nbe, and that is what the Union is here to\nhelp achieve.\nI\u2019m not sure what direction this debate is going to take; indeed as an\nelected representative it isn\u2019t my place\nto make executive decisions but to col-Is it called Welfare coz he iz well fair innit?\nIf students do not\nfeel comfortable\nexpressing\nfeminist (or any)\nperspectives,\nsomething has\ngone very wrong\n\u201d\nhas\nhas\nrong\nong\n\u201c\nIf stude\nIf stude\nfeel com\nfeel com\nlect views and act upon them. We may\nend up with a feminist society, a gender\nequality society, a women\u2019s officer, a\nregular forum facilitated by the Gender Equalities Officer, who is here to\nbe the mouthpiece on these issues, or\nsomething entirely new. To work out\nwhere to go next we will be co-hosting\na forum with those who have recently\nvoiced opinions for all those interested\nin gender issues two weeks from now \u2013\nplease attend if you have any views you\nwould like to be considered.\nIn the meantime if anyone would\nlike to share any thoughts on this issue\nplease feel free to comment or email me\non dpwelfare@imperial.ac.uk.\nthereabouts, we got ourselves in a\nslight muddle.

    "content": "Hyderabad city, India. Capital of the\nstate of Andhra Pradesh, the second\nlargest city in South India, and my\nhometown for the first few years of my\nlife. Having lived in Hyderabad for\nalmost a decade, and visited the place\nvirtually every year since, you can\nunderstand why the city is extremely\nclose to my heart. It would undoubtedly be impossible for me to write about\neverything Hyderabad offers in a mere\nfew hundred words, and I wouldn\u2019t\ndare attempt it, so I\u2019m going to tell you\nabout a few of my favourite sights.\nHyderabad is a perfect mix of al-FELIX\nFriday 24 february 2012\n30\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel Editors: Chris Richardson\nDushi Arumuganesan\nTRAVEL\nVaidehi Konteti luring historical charm, reflecting the\ntown\u2019s heritage, and bustling modern areas: a clear demonstration of\nthe town\u2019s progress. Quirky narrow\nstreets, beautiful mosques and packed\nbazaars are unquestionably the defining features of Old City. Here, you also\nfind Hyderabad\u2019s most famous land-mark, Charminar. The word Charminar\nliterally means \u201cfour towers\u201d, and this\nis an apt description of the monument.\nCharminar, which artfully houses a\nbeautiful mosque, is an ornate structure\nconsisting of four minarets connected\nby arches. Climb up the 150 steps to\nthe top of a minaret, and experience\nimpressive views of the immediate Old\nCity area and beyond.\nJust off one of the side roads from\nCharminar is Laad Bazaar, famous for\nits bangle stores. The bazaar is a spectacular sight of shimmering stores and\nthrongs of people bartering for the best\nprices. The shopkeepers have always\nreminded me of hawks as they wait\naround the shop entrances, swooping\ndown on us at first sight, and luring us\ninto their stores.\n\u201cHyderabad is a perfect mix of historical\ncharm and bustling\nmodern areas\u201d\nA whistle-stop tour through the sights of the famous Indian city\nThe Heart of Hyderabad\nWhile the Old City does have its at-tractions, my favourite spot is actually\na more modern sight: Birla Mandir.\nThis is a handsomely designed temple,\nof Sri Venkateshwara (a Hindu deity),\nbuilt entirely from white marble, which\nis situated on top of the hill \u201cNaubath\nPahad\u201d. The graceful beauty that the\nedifice radiates never fails to draw me\nin; and with fine, intricate carvings, the\ncharm is definitely not lost when seen\nup close. Furthermore, the panoramic\nviews of Hyderabad from the courtyard outside the temple, are simply\nspectacular; seeing the pinpoints of car\nlights and hearing the distant noise of\nbusy city life below, a feeling of calm\nalways envelopes me.\nFrom the vantage point of Birla Mandir another signature sight of Hyderabad is visible. The mammoth Buddha\nStatue, particularly beautiful when lit\nup against the evening sky, is located at\nthe centre of Hussain Sagar, a massive\nartificial lake in the heart of the city.\nSurrounding these waters are an array of noteworthy attractions. Firstly,\nTank bund. This is a popular prom-enade, where families go to buy icecream and coconut water from the\nstreet vendors whilst absorbing the\nview of the lake and the monument.\nNecklace Road, where one may come\nacross the famous NTR gardens, is a\nrecognized hangout for Hyderabadis.\nHere you can also find \u201cEat Street\u201d; I\nam not exaggerating when I say that\nevery imaginable type of cuisine can\nbe found here. I tend to stick to the Indian delicacies, but you\u2019ll be more than\nspoilt for choice, whatever your taste.\nBeware though, during holidays it can\nfeel like the whole city has flocked to\nthis area, so unless you particularly\nwant to battle for seats and devote\nhours to queuing up for your food,\nsteer clear of this zone.\nOver the years, I have travelled to\nmany parts of India and each place\nappeals to me in its own way. Hyderabad\u2019s rich Indo-Muslim-British history and its geographically almost-cen-tral location within India, has shaped it\ninto a city of many influences and this\nis what sets it apart from the rest. The\ncity has so much to offer and I could\ncontinue to write about Golconda Fort,\nFaluknama Palace and so on, but I\nwould never be able to do it full justice.\nExperience it for yourself, and like me,\nyou may just find a spot for Hyderabad\nin your heart.\n\u201cThe graceful beauty\nthat the edifice radiates never fails to\ndraw me in\u201d\n\u201cHyderabad\u2019s rich\nhistory and location\nis what sets it apart\nfrom the rest\u201d\nGet shopping... So much to see, so little time\n\n"

However, on 13 January, the night\nof a Stooshe event in Metric, the entry barrier was being enforced \u201cso tightly\u201d that access to the Union Concert Hall, the venue of\nICU Cinema productions, was not permitted\nwithout paying.\nThe extra charge of \u00a33.50 required by the\nUnion thus raised the cost of seeing a film\nat ICU Cinema to \u00a36.50 or \u00a37.50, depending\non membership status. ICU Cinema also noted that they were not aware of this restricted\naccess until \u201cone of our committee members\nwas refused entry without paying\u201d.\nReduction in attendance due to the additional charge has resulted in losses for the\nsociety, which resulted in the paper requesting \u201ccompensation from the Steward and\nEnts team for lost ticket sales totalling[sic]\n\u00a394.50\u201d, a figure described as \u201cconservative\u201d by the paper.\nICU Cinema told Felix in a statement that\n\u201cICU Cinema were happy that the union\nexec committee acknowledged the difficulties encountered by our event by approving\nour compensation request. While a long\nterm solution to the problem of access to\nclub and society events in the union building\non Wednesday and Friday evenings has not\nyet been reached, we hope one will be found\nand implemented soon.\u201d\nA Union steward, who was not on duty on\nthe 17th, and also wished to remain anony-mous, told Felix that there is a form that societies should submit when an event is held\nwithin the Union building, to allow access\nwithout charging. When someone attempts\nto access such an event, the senior steward\nchecks the paperwork to see if the event really is being held. He continued to say that\nthe form may \u201cnot have been filled out correctly\u201d or \u201cmay have been lost, or filed in\nthe wrong folder\u201d, so causing the issue.\nIn addition to the approval of compensa-tion, alternatives to the current arrangement\nof the entry barrier were discussed \u2013 it is\npartially required to ensure that the rooms\nare not filled beyond legal capacity. It was,\nhowever, acknowledged that this issue was\na one-off, with a lack of communication\nfrom both parties being part of the issue.\nThe union also wishes to support societies\nsuch as Cinema, especially as they want to\nprovide entertainment and activities for students who do not wish to drink.\nA loss of over \u00a390 is significant for the\nsociety, who is experiencing a \u201cfinancial\ndeficit\u201d. Running a film currently costs the\nsociety \u00a3120, making the compensation,\nwhich was given, a large proportion of their\nrunning costs.\nICU Cinema awarded compensation\nfor Friday night Union losses\nPhilip Kent\nWho\u2019s game?\nVarsity 2012\nImperial College vs Imperial Medicals - Wednesday 21 March\nMatches at Harlington, Wilson House, Ethos and The Stoop Stadium, Twickenham, home to Harlequins RFC\n56 teams, 28 matches\n10 sports, 1 winner\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/sports/varsity\nTickets FREE for\nImperial students!\nYou must register for your free JPR Williams match ticket online by 7 March, or you will need to pay the full price of \u00a310 at the gate.\nIn Brief\nDeputy President (Education)\nseized by hitsquad\nOn Friday 17 February, Deputy President (Educa-tion) Jason Parmar was attacked in his office by\nthe RAG hitsquad and dragged to Queen\u2019s Lawn,\nwhere he was tied to a bench and left to rot.

The\ndecision to close the postgraduate hall\nof residence was made in December\nby the College Management Board, a\nbody that has no student members and\nwhose reports are confidential. As it\nemerged at the forum, neither the central Union nor the GSA were directly\ninformed of this decision. The plans\nOpen discussion forum sees mixed views over ongoing developments\ncame to light after Clayponds sub-war-den Craig Court heard rumours about\nthe closure, which were later confirmed\nto Union President Scott Heath. Speaking to Felix the GSA President, Robert\nTang, said that he deeply regrets \u201cthe\nlack of communication the GSA receives regarding the College decisions\non the closure of Clayponds\u201d.\nAccording to Tang, should Clayponds close the cheapest accommodation the College would be offering to\npostgraduates next year \u201cwould be en-suite rooms at Orient House, at around\n\u00a3199 per week\u201d. Heath estimates that,\nincluding travel, the living costs per\nmonth at Orient House are \u00a3200 more\nexpensive than the \u00a3600 per month\nat Clayponds. Rent at the newly constructed Griffon Studios in Battersea\nstarts at \u00a3235 per week. The College\nis planning to open new postgraduate accommodation, Imperial West,\nEarlier this month undergraduates of\nSelwyn College at the University of\nCambridge voted to send a letter to the\nArchbishop of York, John Sentamu, in\nlight of his views on gay marriage. In\nan extensive interview last month with\nThe Daily Telegraph about the Church,\nracism and his life experiences, the\nArchbishop stated a \u201crelationship between a man and a woman \u2013 that\u2019s marriage\u201d.\nThis has come about in light of the\ngovernment moving toward legalising\ngay marriage in Britain. After objections were raised a public consultation\nwas arranged to take place in March to\ndiscuss the topic. Archbishop Sentamu\nraised his objections, affirming that it\nwasn\u2019t the role of the State to define\nwhat marriage is. He predicts that there\nwill be a \u201crebellion\u201d in the House of\nCommons over the issue, being sure\nthat they already have \u201cone hundred\nMPs signing up that they\u2019re against to\nchange this tradition\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to redefine what I call\nvery clear social structures that have\nbeen in existence for a long time and\nthen overnight the state believes it can\ngo in a particular way\u201d commented the\nArchbishop, then relating this move by\nthe government to be like the actions\nof dictators.\nThe letter appeals to Archbishop\nSentamu to reconsider his comments,\nquestioning whether marriage today really is defined as being between a man\nand a woman. They combat his likening\nthe government to dictators, replying,\n\u201cno new measures are being imposed\nupon those heterosexual couples who\nare already married or are planning to\nmarry in the future\u201d.\nThe LGBT Officer of Selwyn College, Lewis Bartlett, explained that\nUniversity students\nrespond to Sentamu\nmarriage comments\nClare Cheng\n...Continued on Page 5\n...Continued on Page 3\nTHE\nSABBATICAL INTERVIEWS\nPage 7\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 24 february 2012 13\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nA\nnyone that knows me\nwell will know that over\nthe past few months I\nhave fallen hopelessly in\nlove. Forgive me for using such a tired clich\u00e9, but it really was\nlove at first sight. Yes, since the moment\nI first clasped my eyes on a Chanel hand-bag, I was infatuated.\nI have a friend who is a designer handbag junkie, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel,\nBalenciaga\u2026 the list goes on. They are\nall beautiful bags, but I never used to understand her obsession. Then, one day, I\nsaw her classic Chanel Flap Bag and I\nsuddenly understood. There was something about the thick, textured, quilted\nleather \u2013 sumptuously soft, yet firm.\nThere was something about the intertwined gold chain and leather strap that\nhugs ones shoulder like an old, comforting friend.And don\u2019t even get me started\non the exquisite finishings \u2013 perfectly\ncrafted inside pockets, the gold hallmark on the inside flap, and of course\nthe trademark Chanel clasp. I would\ndrool over this bag like a lovesick teenager whenever she had it on her. Then,\nin December, my fairy godmother friend\noffered to loan it to me for a few months\nand made my Chanel dreams come true.\nIt took a short while for us to get\ncomfortable with each other. But after\na few awkward outings we became best\nfriends and lovers. My pet name for the\nbag was simply \u2018The Chanel\u2019. Over the\nChristmas holidays The Chanel came\nhome with me to meet my parents, my\nsister, my friends, and my extended\nfamily. Everyone (apart from, unsur-prisingly, my Dad) fell in love with The\nChanel, just as I had. This year, we even\nspent Valentine\u2019s Day together. But this\nis no Hollywood movie. Very soon, The\nChanel will have to be reunited with its\nrightful owner, and our love affair must\nend. As I mourn the loss of a great love,\nI can\u2019t help but reflect upon what it was\nAFrench love affair\nthat I really loved about The Chanel...\nIn our society, material goods provide a vital language through which\nwe communicate with each other about\nthe things that really matter \u2013 family,\nfriendship, community, and purpose in\nlife. We use the language of goods to\ncommunicate status, social identity, af-filiation, and even our feelings. Our\nsociety is constructed so that material\ngoods facilitate our participation in the\nlife of society. As marketing guru Ernest Ditcher poetically puts it: \u201chollow\nhands clasp ludicrous possessions because they are links in the chain of life\u201d.\nMaterial goods have always possessed\nsome kind of intrinsic, symbolic value\nfor humans. But in modernity, and this\nage of wealth, goods are becoming more\nnovel, less meaningful, and more rapidly replaced. We buy novel goods, get\nbored, buy more goods, get bored, all the\nwhile keeping society locked into consumption growth. Our relationships with\nmaterial possessions have become more\nlike fleeting summer romances, rather\nthan great, life-long loves.\nPsychologist Tim Kasser highlights\nwhat he calls the \u2018high price of materialism\u2019 arguing that values such as\npopularity, image, and financial success,\n\u2018external factors\u2019, are psychologically\nopposed to \u2018intrinsic values\u2019such as self-acceptance, affiliation and a sense of belonging in the community. Our society\nis obviously more heavily fabricated\non external factors. This is particularly\nproblematic since it is actually intrinsic\nvalues that contribute most to our sense\nof happiness and well-being, not external factors such as, say, a Chanel bag.\nIn fact, \u201cvoluntary simplicity\u201d has become an entire philosophy for life, drawing on Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s teachings\nsuch as \u201clive simply, that others might\nsimply live\u201d. There is even a scientific\nbasis behind the philosophy that our\nlives become more satisfying when we\nengage in activities that are purposeful\nand materially light. This all makes complete sense, and I find myself agreeing\nwith this notion. Outwardly simple, inwardly rich. I totally get it. However, er,\nnow how can I best put this? I\u2019m sorry\nMahatma Gandhi, but I am still in love\nwith Coco Chanel...\nSo what exactly is it about The Chanel? Mademoiselle Coco Chanel was\nborn into humble beginnings in Saumur,\nFrance in 1983. She grew up in an or-phanage, became a seamstress, and then\nwent on to redesign the way women\ndressed during the 20th Century. She liberated women from their common stereotypical uniform, turned clothes into\nworks of art, and then turned the fashion\nindustry upside down. In short, she had\na dream, made that dream a reality, and\nchanged the world for the better. The\nreason that a Chanel bag is worth more\nthan other bags is because it celebrates\nCoco Chanel.\nI think that owning luxury goods can\nbe about more than just portraying an\nimage to society about who you are.\nOwning luxury goods can also send a\nmessage to others about what human\ncharacteristics you valuable or admire.\nMaterial goods have, and will, always\nhave an important place in our lives.\nHowever, it is time for our relationship\nwith them to change. Rather than just\nblindly chasing novelty goods, (which\nare more familiar to us 90\u2019s babies than\nanyone else \u2013 Tamagotchis, Yo-Yos,\nmicro scooters, Furbies... the list is end-less) we should make more selective\nchoices about what we buy. Our possessions should be less about following\nnovel trends, and more about championing great design or expressing our indi-viduality. Some companies have already\ncottoned onto this \u2013 the NikeiD label is\none example of how consumer goods are\nbecoming more personalised. But there\nis still a long, long way to go.\nThe Western world, at least, needs\nmore quality goods, and less of this\nmass-produced crap. We can all do our\nbit to help advocate quality over quan-tity.As Coco Chanel said herself: \u201cSome\npeople think luxury is the opposite of\npoverty. It\u2019s not. It is the opposite of vulgarity.\u201d\nThe reason that a\nChanel bag is worth\nmore than other\nbags is because\nit celebrates Coco\nChanel\n\u201c\nThe reas\nThe rea\nChanel\nChanel\n\u201d\ns Coco\ns Coco\nOh Coco, smoking isn\u2019t cool, it just sort of looks it.

Whether I\u2019m in the pool, on\nthe bike, or on a run I usually get\nsome \u2018quality\u2019 time with my own\nthoughts. What follows is the result of this\ntime alone\u2026\nRecently in Felix, Laurence de Lussy\nKubisa wrote a remarkable article in\npraise of the new library doors. In typically electrifying prose, he has prostituted\nyour loyalties.

I have to ad-mit, I was rather happily surprised by the end.\nI\u2019m sure most of you know (and love) the\nAdam Sandler classic comedy that goes by the\nsame name. Those of you who do will probably hear the words \u201cmusical adaptation\u201d and\ncringe \u2013 give it a second though! For those of\nyou who live in a box, The Wedding Singer\nwas a 1998 Rom-Com set in the 80s, starring\nAdam Sandler (Robbie, a lowly wedding sing-er) and Drew Barrymore (Julia, a loved-up ca-ter-waitress). The story itself winds around the\n\u2018Will they? Won\u2019t they?\u2019 scenario with plenty\nof hilarity to drag it away from the romance\nand into the comedy.\nHaving originally been an American film,\nbrimming with typical All-American charac-ters, the dreaded American accent, without\nfail, came into play in the MTSoc adaptation.\nHowever, what was noticeably uncomfortable\nin the first half hour slowly died down to the\npoint where the audience would barely notice it at all; the numerous other distractions\nonstage outshine the minor bother of the US\ndrawl.\nOne of the highlights of the evening was\nthe energy-filled \u2018Saturday Night in the City\u2019\nwhere you will get your fill of group dancing\nand 80s pop culture.

The\nchoreography, devised by MTSoc\u2019s James\nPerry, was executed sharply, tightly and with\nvigour; the majority of songs were eagerly\nbelted out with a pleasant lack of bum notes.\nNigel Fullerton as Robbie and Lucy Forman\nas Julia promise to bring real integrity to the\nprotagonists, putting their all into the songs,\ndances and acting in general.\nThis is a great offering from MTSoc, and\nonce tech, props and costumes are in place\n(they hadn\u2019t gotten round to it yet on Monday\nevening \u2013 hence the lack of information on design in this review!) I have great hope that this\nmusical will be as popular with the audience\ntoday as the film was in \u201998.\nThe Wedding Singer at the Union Concert\nHall. From 29 February \u2013 3 March.

Moving down the corridor had the aim of feeling claustrophobic; immersed in the overbearing activity of the mind.\nUnfortunately for me, due to the fact that my\nstature is roughly that of Tom Cruise, it wasn\u2019t\nquite as claustrophobic for me.\nThe creative process was very much organic.\nThe concept was conceived and developed at\nTwisted exhibiton\ngets us all strung up\nhouse parties.

Those damned academic\ncommitments trumped my desire to go see the\nhottest female rapper since Missy Elliott said she\nwanted to search around in my trousers for Lord\nknows what (well, I assume she was talking to me,\nbut one can never be quite sure when it comes to\nmass-distributed music).\nMissing the gig is a bit depressing for two rea-sons: 1) It\u2019s probably the best opportunity I\u2019m going to get to throw myself at Azealia Banks\u2019 feet\nand propose to her, thus beginning what I term,\n\u2018My Incredible Awesome Life as Mr B.\u2019; and 2) I\nhaven\u2019t been to Heaven for a looooooong time and\nI\u2019m beginning to miss it.\nThe last time I was at Heaven (a gay club which\nmoonlights as one of London\u2019s best music ven-ues) was Valentine\u2019s Day 2011 \u2013 I assure you, it\nwas moonlighting as a music venue on that date.\nSleigh Bells were playing that night and my friend\nJamie and I had gone to see them. It was a great\nnight of delightfully unnecessary guitar riffs, pummelling rapid-fire drums, and gratuitous crowd-surfing by vocalist Alexis Krauss. Admittedly there\nwas also a bit of moshing with 16-year-olds but\nhey, kids, if you\u2019re going to get rowdy at a gig, be\nprepared to get owned by a skinny Imperial sociopath on a power-binge.\nSleigh Bells are a band who are on a sort of\na power binge. They know they\u2019ve got big musical guns, and they know that if they point them\nin our general direction things are going to get\nfreaky. Like their debut album Treats, Reign of Terror is full of clashes, thumps, and bangs that are\ndesigned to make you go a bit mental and try to\nbreak your neck. They suffuse this unashamed\nbrashness with Alexis Krauss\u2019 caramelised peach\nvoice in a way that makes you want to piss off\nyour neighbours by turning the volume up to \u2018Bro,\nthat\u2019s quite loud\u2019 at 4am in the morning.\nMy good friend, and doppelganger, Matt Allinson\nrecently posted on Facebook that the \u201cjury is still\nout\u201d on this album. I\u2019m planning on breaking into\nhis flat in the middle of the night, sneaking into\nhis room while he\u2019s sleeping, and jumping onto\nhis bed with with a boombox blaring \u2018Comeback\nKid\u2019, screaming \u201cTHE JURY\u2019S DEAD FROM ALL\nTHE AWESOME!!!\u201d\nIf you have experience in breaking into people\u2019s\nhomes in the small hours of the night, tweet me\n@kadhimshubber and lend your expertise.

These annoying patches are only fleeting and the album has enough beautiful moments to be deemed a successful return to action for the band. The end track, with the same\ntitle as the album, is a shimmering joy which\nleaves the listener in no doubt that The Shins\nare back.\nSubpop, which the band used to be on, are\none of my favourite ever labels. The Seattle\nrecord label which has had everything from\nNirvana to Fleet Foxes on is normally a\nsure-thing for me if I am ever in need of some\nbands to get me through the day. I was therefore disappointed to hear that The Shins would\nnot be releasing on Subpop, as it seemed to\nme to be a marriage made in heaven. It strikes\nme now though, after listening to the album\nas a whole, that by self-releasing, The Shins\nhave been able to produce a more mature and\npolished album. It may not reach the heights\nof Wincing the Night Away but Port of Morrer\ndoes bring a freshness which was sorely missing in 2012. The lolloping indie pop that was\nonce plastered wall to wall at the beginning of\nthe new millennium is now only done well by\na few bands and this album shows that Mercer\nand co deserve to be considered contenders.\nThe latest album from The Shins, Port of\nMorrer is released on March 19.\nbefore reaching Coldplay levels). There is an\nunderlying message of hope throughout the\nalbum which I never garnered from the three\nprevious albums which all had quite dark un-dercurrents. The Shins\u2019 new found maturity\nbrings with it a more expansive sound including string sections and a glockenspiel, with\nsome tracks even verging on funk.\nThere are certain times, however, when the\nsongs fail to hit the mark, including \u2018It\u2019s Only\nLife\u2019, which was not as heartfelt and moving\nI\nwould like to be honest and say that I\nhad little hope for The Shins in 2012.\nTheir Grammy nominated delight,\nWincing the Night Away, shoved lead\nsinger/songwriter into the limelight but\nnearly five years have passed and the musical\nlandscape has changed significantly. When I\nheard the announcement that The Shins were\ngoing to release a new album, Port of Morrer, in March, on frontman James Mercers\u2019\nown label Aural Apothecary, I pondered as to\nwhere the poetic indie pop which I used to so\nenjoy would fit; guitar music has dropped entirely out of the charts and the young dreamers\nwho would once have been exposed to jangly\nalternative rock through watching the OC are\nnow transfixed on the overproduced pomp that\nis Glee. Let us say that it is not 2007 anymore.\nI am pleasantly surprised to report then, that\nafter listening to Port of Morrer, none of these\nissues matter. Mercer has returned with a mature and elegant album, and the wait has certainly done him and the band no harm.\nThe album kicks off with the energetic\n\u2018Rifle\u2019s Spiral\u2019 which is certainly one of the\nstandout tracks for the album. The next track,\n\u2018Simple Song\u2019, was released as a taster to the\nalbum and so the keen-eared among you may\nhave heard it already. It is thoroughly enjoyable with a catchy chorus that nearly verges on\nepic (but thankfully manages to contain itself\nThe Shins are back, but should I care?\nMark England ponders the question on everybody\u2019s lips\nReviewed in 60 Seconds\nMark England\nSimon Hunter\nEverything looks better in the dark\nHaving been released 40 years ago, this review is probably a bit late. For those of you\nwho are less than familiar with the work of\nDavid Bowie this album is a great place to\nstart.\nThe Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the\nSpiders from Mars is about the human-like\nalien, Ziggy Stardust, sent to earth to bring\nhumanity hope in the last five years of its ex-istence. This is one of the shortest and most\naccessible of David Bowie\u2019s albums, and in\nmy opinion his best. It is full of cracking pop/\nglam-rock songs, some of which you will be\nmore than familiar with, all of which will\nleave you keen to press repeat.\nAlex Ramadan\nUsually, listening to Snares would be a great\nway to burn calories through hearing. This time\naround, Aaron Funk stretches time out into a\ngroove, letting shine through all the intricacies\nso deeply ingrained in his work. The result gives\nthe sensation of atmospheric electrocution in\nslow motion.\nThe title sums it up: a kaleidoscopic take on\nan otherwise somewhat monotonously upbeat\ngenre. Less expected are the orchestral samples\ninterspered between percussive jabs akin to\nsticking a knife in a toaster.\nThe aural equivalent of realising that the\nparacetamol you took to help you sleep contained\na significant amount of caffeine.\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nLast June saw the release of Hollie Cook\u2019s self-titled debut album. Unfortunately it passed me\nby at the time \u2013 the wonderful lilting reggae\nrhythms would have been the perfect accompaniment to summer.\nMany parallels can be drawn with Lily Allen;\nboth are London-based daughters of famous\nmusicians (even if Keith Allen is better known\nfor his acting) and both make their own, individual brand of pop music. Despite this, there\nare large differences in their output; Cook\u2019s\nvocals more dreamy, floating effortlessly over\ncatchy reggae hooks.

The men\u2019s\nfirst team kicked off proceedings in\nEthos at 2pm, facing a Durham side who\nturned up with minutes to spare before\nthe scheduled 2pm start. Confidence\nwas high amongst the guys, having been\nfreshly crowned Southern Premiership\nchampions and only having suffered one\ndefeat all season. Durham, on the other\nhand, sat at the bottom of the Northern\npremiership, having lost all their league\nmatches this season.\nThe Imperial team had undergone\na few changes from the team that won\nthe league in late January; president\nEd Collier and top sabreurs Maiyuran\nRatneswaran and Henry Gann were\nunavailable. They were replaced by Camille van Hoffelen and Chris Lawrence.\nThey completed the squad made up of\nChris Gilliam, Indy Leclercq and Glen\nOstacchini in foil; Jonathan Ashcroft,\nTom Powell and Harry Gulliver in the\nepee and Dider Nohlmans, captain, in\nthe sabre.\nAfter a bit of a delayed start (due to\nsome excessively long warming up by\nthe opponents) the first bout of the day\ngot underway in the foil. Ostacchini\nmade a fine start, which was then continued somewhat shakily by Leclercq and\nthen confirmed by Gilliam in the third\nrelay. The foilists found their groove,\nand when the ninth and final bout came\naround, they were a massive 36 points\nahead. Ostacchini dispatched the opposing anchor (an epeeist) in style, to finish\nthe match with a score of 45-14 and a\nvery encouraging lead for the sabreurs\nto build on.\nTechnically, the sabre team fielded\nagainst Durham would count as a \u2018B\u2019\nteam, although this was by no means evident in the cold, calculating demolition\nof the opposing team.

The mere\nsuggestion of this was scoffed at by the\nepeeists, though, with the motivation to\nwin all the more fired up by the victories of their squadmates. The match was\na much tighter affair than the two previous weapons, with Durham leading\nfor most of the way. This was not un-expected: the Northeners\u2019 strong point\nwas known to be the epee, which was\nwhy the team was relieved to have put\nthe match away beforehand. IC were\nthree or four hits down going into the\nfinal bout, and some valiant fencing by\nGulliver saw the match go down to the\nwire, with Durham eventually taking it\n45-43. It was smiles all around as the\nmen fulfilled the expectations and qualified themselves for the semi-finals, to be\nheld at Sheffield.\nNot long after the guys vacated the\npiste, it was the Women\u2019s turn to don\ntheir kit and make sure they were going\nto be joining the guys in Sheffield. The\nteam of Hannah Bryars, Alice Mitchell,\nEmily Bottle, Jing Quek. Zoe Robinson\nand captain Charlotte Levin were ready\nfor a Bristol team currently in a division\nbelow them, the Western 1A. Given that\nthe girls were current southern premiership champions and undefeated all sea-son, the match promised to be straightforward\nStarting with the epee, the girls fought\nvaliantly although the Bristol team\nproved to be too strong for Mitchell,\nBottle and Levin. They posted the respectable score of a 29-45 loss, leaving it\nto the sabreurs and the foilists to win the\nmatch. Up next, indeed, was the sabre \u2013\nfenced by Jing Quek, Bryars and Robinson. This was an IC-dominated affair,\nwith the girls posting a comfortable win:\n45-19. Now 10 points ahead, they were\nperfectly poised for the win, finishing\nwith their strongest weapon, foil. Led\nby Sports scholarship athlete Bryars, the\nfoilists went one better on the sabreurs\nand posted a large victory of 45-13, leaving no chance to the Bristol girls. Tenth\nmatch, tenth victory of the season for the\nseemingly unstoppable Imperial College\nFencing Women\u2019s first team.\nThe serious stuff is now to come, in\nthree weeks time. Both teams will be\nheading up the M1 to the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, where BUCS\nis holding a huge, multisport event for\nthe finals of various cups and champi-onships.

Since then many\nClayponds residents have spoken out\nin praise of Clayponds, with one commentator on the Felix website saying\nthat \u201cthe suggestion that there\u2019s nothing\nto do around Ealing is silly, especially\nin light of the busy Clayponds social\ncalendar\u201d, and that he can make it from\nthe hall to College in \u201c35 minutes\u201d.\nThursday\u2019s forum also questioned the\nCollege\u2019s interpretation of last year\u2019s\nfocus group, with it being pointed out\nthat it showed that while postgraduates\nwere \u201cwilling to accept a commute\u201d as\nlong as it was under \u201c90 minutes\u201d, that\n\u201cthe preferred rent for postgraduate accommodation is \u00a3145 per week\u201d.\nSpeaking at the forum Scott Heath,\nUnion President, said that he would\nraise these issues with the College Accommodation Office, the Rector and\nthe College Council. Speaking to Felix he admitted that the Management\nBoard decision meant that getting a\nreprieve for Clayponds would be \u201cdifficult\u201d but said that he \u201cwill push hard\u201d\nto increase the accommodation bursary.\nViews about the Holland Club, officially a private members club for non-academic staff but in practice frequented by many postgraduates, were more\nmixed. Heath indicated that while the\nUnion will fight to ensure that student\nhave a say in the running of the Club\nhe believes that the College\u2019s proposed\nrenovation of the space could have\nmany benefits, including providing a\ncommon area for taught postgraduates,\nwho are currently barred from the Senior Common Room. Others, however,\npointed out that many postgraduates\nare happy with the Holland Club as it is\nand Club manager Kevin Young complained of the lack of communication\nfrom the College. Director of Commercial Services Jane Neary did not attend\nthe forum.\nTang has told Felix that while he has\nreiterated \u201cthe importance of student\ninput in this project\u201d he wants to em-Future of Clayponds and Holland Club remains unconfirmed\nphasise to students that \u201cthe proposed\nplans is to convert Sherfield Building\nlevel 0 into a 24/7 PG social space\nwith a refurbished Holland Bar and\nnot a closure as previously reported\u201d.\nHe said that he believes \u201cPG (Taught),\nwho cannot currently use the SCR, can\nreally be benefitted from this change\nand I expect the new space can be used\nby PGs who are not normally based at\nSouth Ken.\u201d\nFeedback provided by attendees to\nthe forum showed that the vast majority of attendees were still opposed to\nthe Holland Club proposals. Heath,\nhowever, pointed out to Felix out that\nwith only 35 people of the 100 or so\ninvited to the event on Facebook actually attending it was unlikely that the\nforum was truly representative of the\npostgraduate population.

The\nlatest campaign pictures show an\neclectic yet simultaneously elegant\ncollection, effortlessly working the\nbiggest trends this season. For the\ngirls there are spots and stripes\nclashing excitedly with colour blocking and floral patterns, topped off\nwith chunky bracelets, sweet detachable collars and large petal\nnecklaces. Similarly for the guys,\nthere are some surprisingly wearable pieces in simple slim cuts and\nluxurious fabrics \u2013 what guy doesn\u2019t\nsecretly fancy a bit of silk or cash-mere?\nHowever, with so much going for\nit and such a build up to its launch,\nthere is one slightly large downside\n\u2013 this is a collection that may require overnight campouts, but then\nagain, perhaps that\u2019s a price worth\npaying for such a delectably perfect\npatterned look.\nthoughts makes for the perfect time\nto head over to the pop-up bars and\nboutiques to indulge in some of\nfashion\u2019s favourite munchies; from\nFrea Frozen Yogurt to Chambord,\nwhilst enjoying the tracks being\nspun by fashion\u2019s favourite DJs.\nWhether it\u2019s a complete wardrobe\noverhaul you want or just a chance\nto feel like a front-row editor, LFWeekend is most definitely one not\nto miss.\n\u201cThe International\nFashion Showcase\nhas it all\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE\ncle in the Guardian, Reilly stresses that\nher work was compulsory, \u201cI thought\nthe \u2018training\u2019 was optional, and it came\nas a shock to be told I was required to\nattend;\u201d but the government\u2019s website\nfor sector-based work academies (the\nscheme in which Reilly was made to\nparticipate) clearly states \u201ctaking part\nis voluntary\u201d. So which is it?\nThe government seems to have made\nfinding the answer to this question rather challenging. Unlike other aspects of\nGet Britain Working, the sector-based\nwork academy schemes seem to have\nno formal regulations (or if they do,\nthey are not publicly available).\nBut it is possible to find regulations:\nsimply a matter of discovering an obscure inter-departmental memo from\n15th June 2011 stating that, \u201cService\nAcademies ... should now be known as\nsector-based work academies.\u201d Now,\nService Academies do have formal regulations (though they are a challenge\nto find) and they make for interesting\nreading.\n\u201cThe decision to participate in a Service Academy will be voluntary\u201d according to the regulations, but, \u201conce a\nclaimant...has opted to participate in a\nService Academy, taking up the place\nand attendance on the training becomes\nmandatory.\u201d You can agree or disagree\nto a work experience placement, but\nif you agree you are not allowed to\nchange your mind.\nIt sounds like Cait Reilly was the\nvictim of a very unfortunate misunder-standing. Her adviser rightly told her\nthe training was optional, but neglected to mention that she would have to\nstay for the entire training period if she\nagreed to it. Moreover, in her Guardian article, Reilly claims she was told\nthe training would last for one week,\nrather than two: one week would have\nbeen fine, two weeks forced her to quit\nher museum job. Her adviser\u2019s stupidity cost her her job and, quite possibly,\nspoilt her chances of ever becoming a\ncurator.\nWe might reasonably ask why Reilly\nwas offered the training at all. According to the DWP, \u201csector-based work\nacademies are one of the services that\nJobcentre Plus offers to help you get\nback into work.\u201d But clearly Reilly\u2019s\njob at the museum was more practical\nthan a Poundland training scheme, especially given that she \u201calready had retail experience,\u201d as she claims. Presumably her careers adviser simply forgot\nto take this into account.\nWho, then, is at fault? If we believe\nthe right-wing press, then we must\nblame Cait for complaining at all, but\nin truth Cait was completely right to\ncomplain about her dreadful treatment.\nA\nspectre is haunting our\nfutures \u2013 the spectre of\nunemployment. Most of\nus are soon-to-be gradu-ates: some of us, inevi-tably, are the soon-to-be unemployed.\nWith every month, increasing numbers\nof young people are finding themselves\njobless, and increasing numbers are\nturning to the government for support.\nBut what kind of support do they re-ceive? The \u201cWork for your Benefits\u201d\nscandal has flooded the media with\nallegations and insinuations about the\ngovernment\u2019s treatment of the unem-ployed: is it supportive help or slave\nlabour? As graduation day approaches,\nwe all need to be aware of what is really going on; we need to be prepared\nfor when unemployment comes for us.\nA case study: Cait Reilly\nYou might be familiar with the story of\nCait Reilly, an unemployed Birmingham University graduate who wanted\nto be a curator. Jobless for 18 months,\nshe eventually managed to find unpaid\nwork in a museum to gain experience\nwhile looking for a paid job. But a\nmuseum was not good enough for the\ngovernment: she had to cancel the work\nand take up \u201ctraining\u201d at Poundland\ninstead, or lose her \u00a353 per week Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance.\n\u201cIt was not training, but two weeks\u2019\nunpaid work stacking shelves and\ncleaning floors,\u201d she wrote in the\nGuardian, \u201cI came out with nothing;\nPoundland gained considerably.\u201d Her\nstory started a wave of popular disdain for what has come to be known as\n\u201cworkfare\u201d.\nAs part of its Get Britain Working\nprogramme, the Department for Work\nand Pensions (DWP) has introduced\nnew work experience schemes for the\nunemployed \u201cwhich aim to fight pov-erty, support the most vulnerable and\nhelp people break the cycle of benefit\ndependency.\u201d\nBut critics argue that the reforms are\nnothing more than forced labour, that\nthey exacerbate unemployment and\nthat they provide corporations with\nfree work paid for by the taxpayer. \u201cWe\nwere doing exactly the same work as\nthe paid staff,\u201d said Reilly, \u201cIf the Government subsidises high street chains\nwith free labour, they don\u2019t have to\nrecruit. It causes unemployment rather\nthan [solving] it.\u201d\nReilly has become a divisive figure: a\nhero for those on the left, a lazy elitist\nto those on the right. But for all its emotional power, the truth behind her story\nhas remained elusive. In her own arti-If we believe the left, then we must\nblame the government for having this\nscheme in the first place: understand-able, but again wrong. The blame can\nonly be left with the careers adviser,\nand her employers.\nThe fact that Reilly\u2019s adviser evidently caused her suffering raises the\nquestion of how much power advisers\nactually have. What do they have the\nauthority to do, who do they work for,\nand are they accountable when they\nmake mistakes?\nForced labour or not?\nThe DWP\u2019s Get Britain Working\nhomepage is a chaotic mixture of various overlapping schemes, programmes\nand initiatives. Aside from Reilly\u2019s\nsector-based work academies, the government also offers two other alleged\n\u201cforced labour\u201d schemes: Work Experience and Mandatory Work Activity\n(MWA). These are the source of a lot\nof the popular anger about the Get Britain Working programme, and, as with\nmany things that cause anger, they are\nnot fully understood.\nWriting in the Guardian, John Harris said of people on Work Experience\nschemes, \u201cthey can refuse to take part\nor pull out during the first seven days,\nbut thereafter the work becomes compulsory.\u201d This is not quite true. Benefits\ncan, in fact, be removed from any job\nseeker who, \u201chas, without good cause,\nneglected to avail himself of a reasonable opportunity of a place on a training scheme.\u201d In other words, if your\nadvisor suggests a Work Experience\nscheme and you refuse it, you risk having benefits stopped for anything from\none week to six months.\nBut fear not! There is a way to avoid\nWork Experience: you must first agree\nto it, then attend the first meeting, and\nthen within seven days you must tell\nyour adviser in writing that you wish to\nleave the job. Simple! Not only is Work\nExperience rather more punitive than\nJohn Harris claimed, but it comes with\na prohibitively complex set of regulations that take a lot of time to under-stand: it must be easy to get caught out\nby them, and get punished as a conse-quence.\nThe Mandatory Work Activity\nschemes are altogether more contro-versial. \u201cWhere advisers believe a job-seeker will benefit from experiencing\nthe habits and routines of working life,\nthey have the power to refer them to\na four week placement,\u201d according to\nthe Department for Work and Pensions.\nBut according to John Harris, \u201cpeople\nare forced \u2013 via the threat of their jobseeker\u2019s allowance being suspended \u2013\nto put in 30 hours a week doing work.\u201d\nAgain, rhetoric about MWA is everywhere but facts are harder to come by.\nThe content of these schemes is very\nlike Work Experience, the real difference is in the sanctions for failure. A\njob seeker cannot choose whether or\nnot to participate in the scheme, it is\naimed at those who lack the motivation\nto voluntarily take part in Work Experience. If you refuse the scheme, you lose\n13 weeks\u2019 JSA; if you miss a day of\nwork, you lose 13 weeks\u2019 JSA; if your\nsupervisor is dissatisfied with your per-formance, you lose 13 weeks\u2019 JSA. If\nyou fail your Mandatory Work Activity\ntwice then the penalty increases to 26\nweeks. And if the Welfare Reform Bill\nbecomes law, a triple failure at MWA\nwill cancel your benefits for 3 years.\nIf 26 weeks with no income (and presumably no food or shelter) were not\nbad enough, note that there is no way to\nappeal against the decision, even if you\nbelieve the punishment to be a mistake.\nThe only way is to take the government to court, a high-stress prospect,\neven worse at a time when you have no\nmoney to pay for travel or a lawyer.\nIf you are able to demonstrate \u201chardship\u201d then you may be able to keep\nyour benefits, but in the MWA regulations the definition of \u201chardship\u201d focusses almost exclusively on those who\nare severely disabled, pregnant, or with\nyoung children. There is little hope for\nan able-bodied, childless job seeker.\nIt is disconcertingly easy to describe\nall three kinds of work experience as\n\u201cforced labour\u201d. In the case of MWA,\nthe work is genuinely forced; the other\ncases provide ways of avoiding the\nwork, but the regulations are so unnecessarily complicated that knowing\nhow to quit is a huge challenge in it-self. I believe it is likely that the government made the regulations complex\non purpose: this way they can claim the\nschemes are voluntary, while in practice they are not.\nThe advisers\u2019 authority is also worth\nquestioning. In all these cases an adviser has the power to force someone to\nwork, even when, as with Cait Reilly,\nthe work spoils their future prospects.\nThe MWA regulations tell us where\nthis authority comes from: the power\nto force someone to work \u201cmay be exercised by, or by employees of, such\nperson (if any) as may be authorised by\nthe Secretary of State.\u201d Up until now, I\nhad believed that the advisers were employed by the state as civil servants: I\nwas wrong.\nThe Job Centre Myth\nIn the popular imagination, Jobcentre\nPlus is a government agency and its\ncareers advisers work for the govern-A cartoon demonstrating the popular perception of workfare\nFELIX\nFriday 24 FEBRUARY 2012\n8\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nTruth, lies and tall tales abou\nStephen Smith conducts an in-depth investigation of the Workfare scandal.

Horrified, Walter and Gary\nsearch out Kermit (Steve Whitmire),\nwho is depressed from his dull post-the-atre life, and together they round up the\nold Muppets Gang.\nThey find Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson)\nplaying with a tribute group called the\nMoopets in Reno, Gonzo (Dave Goelz)\nrunning a firm selling toilet bowls and\nMiss Piggy (Jacobson again) editing Paris Vogue. Among the guest stars is Emily\nBlunt, amusingly reprising her role from\nThey\u2019re back! YES!

Yes the story is\nridiculous, yes the jokes are cheesy, yes\nthe whole thing is mental but come on \u2013\nyou\u2019ve got to admit you\u2019ve missed them.\nIn this latest tale of hilarity, the Muppets\u2019 greatest fan Walter (Peter Linz),\nwho is himself a muppet from Smalltown, USA, is on holiday in Hollywood\nDirector James Bobin\nScreenwriters Jason Segel,\nNicholas Stoller, Jim Henson\nCast Jason Segel, Amy Adams,\nChris Cooper\nThe Muppets\nLucy Wiles\nThe return of the Muppet puppets\nThe Devil Wears Prada as Miss Piggy\u2019s\nsecretary. Can the old gang pull together\nfor one last show and raise the $10m\nneeded to buy back the old studio from\nTex Richman?\nThe film is actually cleverly done. Using the Muppets\u2019 long absence from the\ntelevision as a premise, this film neatly\ntaps into us old nostalgic former fans,\nwho still feel for these anarchic and\nloveable characters, whilst also winning\nover new followers. And even though\nit\u2019s very silly, it\u2019s still hugely enjoyable.\nThe film\u2019s humour and big-heartedness\nare refreshingly disingenuous, the self-referential jokes very well-handled.\nAs it always has been, the beauty of\nthe Muppet is the insincerity; in fact the\nonly sincere thing about it is the affection\nemanating from the audience.

As the\noverly sentimental, manipulative film\nthat stole the much-coveted Best Picture slot from Drive, the lowest rated\nfilm on Rotten Tomatoes that made it to\nthe nominations list in this year\u2019s Oscars, it looks as though Daldry\u2019s most\nrecent work won\u2019t be receiving similar\nattention his previous films such as Billy Elliot and The Hours enjoyed.\n9/11 is a delicate subject that cannot\nbe taken lightly in fictitious work. Set\na foot wrong and you will most likely\noffend those who were involved in the\nincident. It remains a fresh wound, and\ntherefore the subject needs careful di-rection. But with Extremely Loud and\nIncredibly Close, Daldry is too careful\n\u2013 and is so worried of doing anything\never so slightly wrong that he struggles\nto aim higher. The story centres on a\nyoung, intelligent boy, Oskar (Horn),\nwho may or may not have Asperger\u2019s\nSyndrome (\u201cthe tests were inconclusive\u201d), who loses his father (Hanks) in\none of the Towers. He and his father\nwere close, and the many expeditions\nhis father sent him on, a set of elaborate\ntreasure hunts riddled with fascinating\nclues and investigations, are no more.\nA year goes by, and finally working\nup the courage to enter his father\u2019s\nroom which has been left untouched by\nhis mother (Bullock), he finds an envelope with the name \u201cBlack\u201d written on\nit, and inside, a key. Interpreting this as\nhis deceased father\u2019s one last expedition set out for Oskar to embark on, he\nmakes it his mission to find out what\nthis key opens and why his father left\nit hidden for him. His hunt takes him\nall over New York, as he slowly works\nhis way through visiting every single\nperson in the city named Black, asking\nabout his father. He meets a variety of\ncharacters, none of whom can help him\nregarding the key.\nEvery encounter he has with a different stranger is somehow a new lesson\nlearned. A long list of fantastic supporting actors surround Oskar in his jour-ney: Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright\nplay a couple going through a divorce,\nJohn Goodman is the sympathetic door-man, Zoe Caldwell is the caring and\nconcerned grandmother, Bullock as the\nmother he doesn\u2019t quite appreciate, and\nmost memorably, Max von Sydow as\nan old renter in Oskar\u2019s grandmother\u2019s\nhouse who he befriends. He doesn\u2019t\nspeak, and communicates by writing\nnotes, and with the words \u2018yes\u2019and \u2018no\u2019\nwritten on the palms of his hands. With\nabsolutely no dialogue, von Sydow enters the film with warmth, immediately\nbefriending Oskar, becoming the only\nperson the young boy can vent his anger to.\nThe problem with Daldry\u2019s film is\nthis: it only makes a lasting emotional\nimpact using its supporting characters.\nNothing substantial ever materialises\nfrom the boy alone, and his quest to\nfinding the right lock for his key loses\nsteam very quickly, because something\nthis far-fetched will not have a meaningful answer \u2013 and surprise, surprise,\nthe mystery behind the key is nothing\nmore than a simple misunderstanding,\nalmost rendering the long build-up use-less. Oskar is furious when he finds out,\nand chances are, you will be, too.\nHorn, a new discovery in his remarkable screen debut, doesn\u2019t have the\nluck of playing a likable part \u2013 often\nthe boy\u2019s naive yet relentless obsession is irritating to watch \u2013 as he lashes\nout at those trying to help him. The\nconstant flashback that shows Oskar\u2019s\npainful reaction to his father\u2019s death is\noften too forced for its own good, and\nit\u2019s far from a pleasant experience being repeatedly bombarded with heavy-handed scenes. Oskar is a unique child\nbut the film fails to explore any deeper\ninto the boy\u2019s upbringing or surroundings that attempt to explain his charac-ter.\nMuch like this year\u2019s string of disappointing films (J. Edgar, The Iron\nLady), Daldry puts together a wonderful ensemble of actors, but doesn\u2019t\nknow quite what to do with all the\ntalented individuals in the cast. There\nare unquestionably moving moments,\nthanks largely to Bullock (watch as\nshe steals the final few moments of the\nfilm) and Davis, but even all of these do\nnot add up to much, leaving the central\nprotagonist with a lame little adventure\nwith hardly any sense of fulfillment.\nThe final scene is an even bigger disap-pointment, brutally trivialising the rest\nof the film. We spent two hours watching the trials and struggles of an immature little boy with far too much to\nhandle at his age. But what does this all\nmean and come down to? Shockingly,\nnot a lot.\nNow listen, that headline up there is in no way sexual. I swear!!!\nFELIX Friday 24 February 2012 25\n\n"

Imperial has never had any support for students\nwho aren\u2019t in halls and with a bit of effort I\u2019ve\nmanaged to secure funding for them directly\nfrom college because they saw that that was\nsomething that needed doing. I guess it\u2019s just\nthe general thing of asking for something to\nhappen and if it\u2019s reasonable it usually happens.\nFor example, in the cafeteria, there was no glu-ten-free signposting. A group of students said\nthey wanted it so I took the issue to catering and\nit happened. In addition, there wasn\u2019t enough\nstorage capacity for cycle storage in Beit Quad;\nstudents said that they wanted more and now it\u2019s\nmore than doubled. It was also really satisfying working on the student experience survey\nbecause we got a 50% response rate. College is\nworking on that and once that\u2019s fully unpicked\na lot of interesting things will come out of it.\nWhat have you enjoyed least?\nFrustration: trying to get staff and students to do\nthings when they\u2019re just too busy. Very rarely is\nit lack of will \u2013 it\u2019s almost always that it just gets\nleft by the wayside. There\u2019s also the frustration\nof not having enough time to get everything you\nwant to do done this year. However this is going\nto change as I\u2019ve created training for welfare\nofficers, so they\u2019ll be better equipped to do their\njobs so, in turn, students are better equipped to\nachieve their goals in terms of campaigns. It\u2019s\nalso incredibly frustrating occasionally not being kept in the loop with big decisions. Sometimes you come up against a wall and are unable\nto change things that seem easy but for bureaucratic or logistical and legal reasons that can\u2019t\nbe done. It is also hard to let people know what\nyou\u2019re doing and to maintain dialogue \u2013 it\u2019s not\neasy.\nHow far have you delivered on your manifesto points?\nI had seven objectives. I would say the introduction of a GUM clinic at the Health Centre isn\u2019t\npossible, however I\u2019ve been in contact with\ncharities to see if they\u2019ll provide screenings on\ncampus, which is looking hopeful. As for the\nrest of them, I\u2019ve done them. Revamping volunteering is really exciting; we\u2019ve engaged a staff\nvolunteer who is going to create a brokerage\nservice to help students achieve their goals. For\ncampaign weeks we have a new system \u2013 any\nstudent can campaign on anything they want.\nThey just have to fill in an application form;\nthey don\u2019t have to be a special officer to do that.\nApart from that I\u2019ve come up with a billion new\nobjectives. We\u2019re soon going to have poster\nboards around college with welfare information on them in the toilets. We ran the welfare\nsurvey. We\u2019re having Imperial\u2019s first ever blood\ndrive \u2013 that\u2019s coming up in the next few weeks,\nand we are about to regain our fair-trade status\nwhich we lost two or three years ago.\nIs there such a thing as an average day?\nThere is no average day! For example, yesterday I was on the interview panel for a new\ndisabilities tutor from 10am to 5:30pm, after\nwhich i had to catch up with 80 new emails in\nmy inbox. The day before that i had 5 hours of\nmeetings and emails in-between! However, in\nan average week I have two or three big college committee meetings, five or six meetings\nwith senior college staff about issues such as\nsecurity, accommodation, counselling, and the\nHealth Centre. Then I have several meetings\nwith students, the welfare officers and sometimes students come to me with campaigns they\nwant to run or other personal issues.\nWhat have you gained from being DPW?\nI would say an appreciation of the importance\nof prioritising big projects. If you spend all\nyour time answering emails or going to meetings then you don\u2019t actually get anything done.\nI\u2019ve also learnt how much the Union does and\nhow much you can get done in this position.\nI\u2019ve also been inspired meeting senior people\nwho have similar values and care about similar\nthings.\nWhat advice would you give to those considering running for DPW?\nYou really need to think carefully about what\nneeds to change. You should find out what issues there are, learn about quality legislation,\nabout how many different areas the DPW looks\nafter, and how completely different your year\ncould be depending on where you decide to pri-oritise. You also need to realise how important\nit is to decide and to have good officers so that\nthey can focus on certain areas while you look\nafter others.\nW\nhat have you enjoyed most?\nI\u2019ve enjoyed having an excellent insight into the higher education system. I get to meet\nrepresentatives from other\nRussell Group Student Unions at the Aldwych\nGroup where we talk about a whole host of top-ics. Seeing how other institutions deal with issues,\nand seeing how Imperial is unique in its own way\nhas been fantastic. I\u2019ve also enjoyed learning time\nefficient techniques that you can only learn where\nyou\u2019re balancing a huge amount of things. I\u2019ve\ndone things I didn\u2019t think I could do in the past\nby effectively organising my time. I was also fortunate enough to attend the IDEA league and take\ncharge in running my own projects, like Representation Week 2012 and working in a representation\nteam to produce the White Paper Response and the\nNational Student Survey Response.\nWhat have you enjoyed least?\nIt was hard at the start to get things done as quickly\nas I wanted. There are more bureaucratic processes\nboth in the College and Union than I naively antici-pated. Although we aren\u2019t one of the most bureaucratic institutions, occasionally it can be frustrating\nwhen things move more slowly than you\u2019d initially\nplanned. But a larger contributor to \u201cSabbatical\ndissatisfaction\u201d is probably the sheer amount of\nmeetings and e-mails. Some can feel like an inefficient use of time as you often create a large workload through your meetings and then can be in the\nposition where you don\u2019t have time to complete it!\nHow far have you delivered on your manifesto\npoints?\nObviously there aren\u2019t any 8am starts, but the College Working Day is still a contentious and very\nmuch ongoing issue. It\u2019s definitely not over yet,\nand we\u2019re trying to make sure we get involved with\nall the future strategic conversations. One question\nthat\u2019s in the back of my mind is \u2018is an hour too long\nor short for a lecture?\u2019\nThis year we made sure our voice was still heard\nby the government by writing our response to the\nGovernment\u2019s White Paper. Interestingly, the government actually listened to us and have scraped\npenalties for early repayment. I\u2019d like to think that\nit wasn\u2019t just coincidence and we helped the government make the decision. Soon, we\u2019ll introduce\nNotebox, which is a site for shared learning for all\nImperial students. It has notes, past papers and forums for every module in every department.\nRegarding e-learning in general, it\u2019s been fantastic to see the idea of podcasting being resonated\naround the university (mostly with students) in\nline with my manifesto 11 months ago. We might\nstill be years behind places like MIT but we\u2019ve approved Panopto as the method for video podcasting after an extended pilot scheme where some\n200 lectures were trialled. I ideally hope for an\nrollout before the end of the year, but most likely\nI\u2019d be pleased if it can be fully rolled out by the\nstart of next year.\nIs there such a thing as an average day?\nJust like I\u2019m sure every other sabbatical in the\ncountry says, \u201cthere is no such thing as an average week\u201d. But it\u2019s true, our remits mean we cover\nso many different areas that we\u2019re always doing\nsomething different each week, it\u2019s what makes the\njob so interesting. usually there are one or two of\nthe many large committees I sit on that are usually\ntwo-three hours long, along with meeting with senior College figures. The rest of the time is spent\nwith the huge amount of emails/tasks and some of\nmy own projects. Finally, for a break I\u2019ll play some\nsquash and get out some of that excess stress.\nWhat have you gained from being DPE?\nI\u2019ve gained an incredible insight into how a mul-timillion pound company and university works,\nthe experience has been amazing. I\u2019ve been privileged to proudly represent all 14,000 students at\nImperial College. I get the opportunity to work\nalongside world leaders, which is amazing. I\u2019ve\ngained more public speaking experience, and definitely improved my leadership and communication skills. I\u2019ve been able to significantly improve\nmy non-academic skills in this role, which nicely\ncompliments the excellent education I\u2019ve had so\nfar at Imperial.\nWhat advice would you give to those considering running for DPE?\nThere\u2019s a huge amount of emails and meetings. I\nwas surprised coming in and not being able to just\nget on with your projects. There\u2019s a large remit and\ns it\u2019s almost like being a consultant at times. I think\nit\u2019s really important that next year\u2019s DPE remembers that you won\u2019t always get the quick results\nyou expect, there\u2019s often complications, approvals\nor financial issues. Also, a lot of the job is thinking strategically. You can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t always\nexpect immediate results as much of what you do\nwill be sowing the seeds for future generations\nof students, so some of your work often won\u2019t be\nseen for years to come.\nJason Parmar\nDeputy President\n(Education)\nNicolas Massie\nDeputy President\n(Welfare)\nThe DPW helps students with various welfare issues that they could\npotentially encounter in their time\nat Imperial College\nThe role of DPE exists to serve the\nacademic needs of the student\nbody through liasing with academics and College staff\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nNEWS\n\n"
