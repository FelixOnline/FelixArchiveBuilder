    "content": "10 MU X IC FOLK CLUB\nThe Rise and Fall FOR THOSE who have not heard, the\nImperial College Folk Song Club has\ncancelled the last five events planned\nfor the 1975\u201476 academic year, including\nthe termly Ce ili dh, and a guest\nappearance by Rosie Hardman.\nThe reason? The club has over\ntwo hundred members in and around\nIC, but in recent weeks we have\nregularly run the club with barely\ntwenty people in the audience. Evidently,\nthere has been a sudden drop in interest\nin folk music; or perhaps there is a general concensus of opinion that IC\nFolk Club is not as good as it once\nwas; or maybe it is too expensive, or\nthe last bus is too unreliable, or tube\nfares are too high, or there is too\nmuch work to do . . . . ? ? ? ? Whatever the\nreason there is little point in continuing.\nIt is both embarrassing to the organisers,\nand insulting to the guests, to ask\nprofessional singers to travel a couple\nof hundred miles to play to so few\npeople, however enthusiastic they\nmay oe.\nBut enough of moaning about the\npast:\nNomination papers have already\nbeen posted for next year's committee,\nwho traditionally take over at Easter.\nThere will be an AGM before the end\nof term, at which I hope there will be\nsome serious discussion about the\nfuture of the club. Indeed, the credibility\nof the entertainment for \" minority\" groups in College could be a serious\nsubject for debate. Does it matter if\nFolk Club disappears? Maybe Jazz Club will be next? Maybe Film Soc?\nMaybe Ents? If students want\nentertainment \" On Campus\", they\nsometimes seem very reluctant to show\nit! If they do not want it, we may as well\nall give up! I hope that Folk Club will\nreappear in October, as strong and\nenjoyable as ever. I hope there will\nbe someone there to join in the chorus,\ntoo.\nby Dave Rhodes WANTED\nFELIX\nSTAFF!!\nIn this clean orderly,disciplined world,\nwho needs guys like McMurphy?\nEverybody!\nJACK KKH OU OW OWE FLEW\nOVER THE\nCUCKOO* NEST\nJantasyJ'ilm s^ Hf j V presents m kwA MILOS FORMAN FILM JACK NICHOLSON in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST'X Starting LOUISE FLETCHER and WILLIAM REDF1ELD Screenplay LAWRENCE HAUBENana1\nBO GOLDMAN\nBasedon the novel by KEN KESEY Director of Photography HASKELL WEXLER \u2022 Music-JACK NITZSCHE\nProducedby SAUL ZAENTZ and MICHAEL DOUGLAS Directedby MILOS FORMAN V United Artists\n* \u2022\n\u2022\nAT\nran s america Comp an1| OWIGINAL SOUNDTRACK ALBUM AVAILABLE ON FANTASY FtECOBOS]\nODEON LEICESTER SO\nTELEPHONE:|.9306111 "

So I don't think I could be judged harsh, for expecting\nsomething above average, but for me,\nthe band's brand of sleazy, B movie\nmusic came in furlongs behind the\nexciting rock'n 'roll animal that was Eddie and the Hot Rods. The Hot Rod's singer, be spl end ent in odd striped pyjamas who was presumably ' Eddie', was the hero of\nthe night, cartwheeling, running and\njumping his way through a variety of\ngood rockin' songs, drawing on what\nseemed limitless amounts of energy\nTheatre\nMusic Here, for public delectation, is the second instalment of Alan. Douglas'\ntrilogy of make-what-you-can-of-400-hours-of-unused-Hendrix-factory-jams\nalbums, a basically thankless task no\ndoubt motivated by green ies before\nthe eyeballs. The genius of the man (Hendrix,\nthat is) is still there \u2014 that's been\nevident in even his worst moments,\nexcept the pitiful \" Isle of Wight\"\nrelease when he was most definitely\nunfit for play, but the way that the\nperformances have had to be fiddled\nwith, edited, and abruptly lopped off\nin places shows how desperate people\ncan get when they think they're onto a sure thing and have to capital is e on it.\nThe title track is a tasty little\nHendrix blues, with a solo that sounds\nbeautifully co-ordinated and rehearsed\nfor something that has been allowed\nto gather dust for years in a warehouse\nawaiting the outcome of all the legal\nto maintain the visual excitement of\nhis acrobatics. I got the impression\nthere was a frustrated violence trying\nto escape through Eddie's act, which\nseemed to me to range from the\nsexuality of Jagger to the absurdity of\nChaplin. All this was backed up by\nthe Hot Rods themselves, a tighter\nbunch of young rockers you couldn't wish to see or hear anywhere.\nSo to the Kursaal Flyers, stars of\nstage, screen and the NME. They were\nvery well received by the sizeable attendance, why, I cannot say, their\nset being a much more limp one than\nthat of their predecessors. True, I was not exactly familiar with the\nSorry folks!\nThomas Stevenson\nThirdly, lastly, finally and in\nconclusion, the 21st National Student\nDrama Festival is rapidly approaching,\nit takes place in Edinburgh from 2\u20149\nApril, and, although IC will be unrepresented this year, still promises\nto give a good time to all participants,\nwhether active or passive. Last year, in London, IC Dramsoc's performance of Albert' s Bridge by\nTom Stoppard was one of the highlights\n(you may have seen a photograph of\nthe production in the new NUS newspaper). A number of Dramsoc\nmembers spent the whole week at the\nFestival and found it stimulating and\nexciting. If you want to know more\nabout the 1976 Festival I suggest you\ncontact me or those in the Dramsoc\nstoreroom. The programme is likely to\nbe announced next week.\nInspired music\nHie\nhassling and double-dealing that has\nbeen going on since James Marshall \u2022\nHendrix moved on to (hopefully) better\ntimes.\n\" Hear my train\" is of course just\na filler, considering the completeness\nof the eleven-and-a quarter minute\nversion on the \" Rainbow bridge\" set. No way could you add much to that\nversion.\nHearing this, so many years after\nhe' s disappeared from the forefront of\nthe biz brings back the reason why he' s considered so great \u2014 the amount of\n\" feeling\" to be found everywhere in\nhis playing. This record isn't perfect,\nit's not precise or crisp, not even\ntechnically amazing, but it contains\ngreater things than devices or studio\ntechniques can produce. It's inspired\nmusic, where Hendrix constantly\nexplores, and it's beautifully un contrived and natural.\nThere are some dod gy moments, as Dobin Degoslow\nrepertoire, save for their single\n'Speedway', but then neither am I with the Hot Rod's. Paul Shuttleworth, much photographed\nsinger of the Flyers, came on like\nSouthend's answer to Humphry Bogart,\nsliding his way through a particularly\ngutless set of songs, which for some\nreason, seemed to be setting the\naudience alight. Ironically the Kur saal' s highest moment came with the encore.\nGene Pitney' s\"24 Hours from Tulsa\". In a pub atmosphere, the lyrics and\nmannerisms of Shuttleworth probably\ncome across better, but like their\nfellow booze band Kilburn and the\nHigh Roads, no way are they going to\nmake it on the concert circuit.\ncontinued from page 8\nJULIE TIPPETS - FREE3IRD!\nnatural to do it like that. I mean, I 've\ndone a lot of experimenting in the last\nfew years, and had intended a couple of\nyears ago to make a completely 'free'\nalbum,' sort of using the same sort of\nlayers, but completely free, no actual\nstructures. But then I found I was actually writing songs, you know, and it\ncame out like that.\" Right now Julie Tippetts is rehearsing\nher new band, Butterfly, in readiness\nfor a short tour of mostly colleges, which started in Manchester on February\n24th followed by a London gig at Kings\nCollege two days later.\n. Did she see the band staying\ntogether as a long term thing?\n\" We're seeing how it goes with this\ntour. I mean obviously it would be nice\nto carry it on if it feels good, and if\npeople like it. There are tentative\nplans for it in the future, but at the\nmoment I just want to get these two\nweeks out of the way. There are things\nin the air for going abroad, but I'd just\nlike to see how it goes and take it from\nthere \u2014 I don't want to look too far\nahead.\" Her coffee remains untouched ... but\nI never doubted her for a moment.\nCOPY DATE\nMon 1st March\n2.00pm on \" Blue suede shoes\" which sounds\nlame compared to his\" In the West\" version, and \" Machine Gun\" never\nwas a particularly good song, likewise here. But the albums slowest number\n\" Once I had a woman\", taken at ape de strain blues pace oozes with\nconfident relaxed guitar-work, vaguely\nreminiscent of \" Red House\". From necessity, it's a bit butchered\nin parts, but you can't keep a good\nman down, especially when he' s of\nHendrix quality and although he hasn't been circulating for the last 5 years he\nstill stands head and- shoulders above\nanything that's arrived since his departure. The man was a giant.\nFIRSTLY MY apologies to Paul\nEkpenyong and all the other readers\nwho were fooled by last week's review.\nAs far as I know the Chi eve ley Theatre\ndoes not exist and no playwright has\nbeen crafty enough to claim the authorship of the three plays described\n;though I am working on' t). Secondly, the latest news from the\nNational Theatre on their ticket selling scheme. You will remember that, a few\nweeks ago, I mentioned that the cheapest\nseats available for booking in advance\nin the Lyttelton Theatre will be \u00a32.35;\nthe \u00a31 and 50p seats will only be\navailable on the day of the performance\nto those willing to queue at 8.30an Their latest advertisement says, in\nvery small print, that for performances\nfrom May 1st they will sell half the\ncheap seats in advance. That' s progress\nfor you.\nJimi Hendrix - Midnight Lightning (Polydor)\n\n"

    "content": "6\nmix External Eclairs\nA typical week in the life of an External Affairs Officer\nMONDAY Got up just in time for a10.30 am lecture. Having\nsurvived this, I rushed off to the Union to check the post. I then\nwrote up a lab report and typed a few envelopes for a petition\nwhich I was circulating to all Council members (on Discretionary\nGrants). At 5.30pm I took a seat in the S CR for the Union Finance Committee meeting. First we sorted out the Union Estimates for\nnext year and then went on to discuss major equipment claims from the clubs and societies, which are, of course, the most\nimportant part of the Union for the ordinary student.\nTUESDAY Staggled out of bed at about 12.00 noon having\nmissed the morning's lecture and made, my way into College, stopping for some shopping en route. Distributed petitions and\nsettled down in the Union office to scribble a few lines for the\nAlternative Prospectus, which is to be sent out to prospective\nfresher s. Chatted to Jill Daniels, President of RCA about IC students\nusing their refectories and various other topics. Phoned IF to\nspeak to Margaret Slimming, but she'd gone to Liverpool. At 5.30pm STOIC wanted to interview me for some reason so\nI went along and sat with Chalky, making faces at Nick and Tony\nwhile they were being interviewed.\nBushed straight off to Ealing Technical College with Duncan\nTurner, secretary to the External Affairs Committee, for a meeting of the West London Are aLSO. This was extremely boring,\nespecially since we were in quo rate and therefore unable to take\nany decisions. I proposed that we make funds and transport for\nthe next NUS conference available to all small colleges( less\nthan 750 students) in West London, and this was accepted.\nPicked up a Sennet on the way home \u2014 mostly as boring as\nNational Student. I was very interested to read about the election\nprocedure at Thames Polytechnic, perhaps some of their ideas\nare worth considering for IC.\nWED NE SAY \u2014 Actually made it to lectures today. Went along\nto the J CR at lunchtime to hear the arguments. I'm afraid I don't quite understand the need for a separate \" action group\", surely the Overseas Student Committee is adequate? Spent an\nhour or so wandering around the College putting up posters for\nthe demo today.\nI phoned up Brunei University to talk to Phil Stopford, their\nExternal Affairs VP. He told me that they are also knee-deep\nin elections; the new President is Jim Dale, an Independent\nSocialist. I was interested to hear that David Wilks,( the first\nConservative, to be elected to an NUS Committee since1969, when he received the most first preference votes at the recent\nUniversities Conference), had been elected President at Leicester University by 1000 votes to 200. Last year's President was a Marxist. That should send the old swing-o meter be ser k! In the evening I attended the UL US RC( Students Representative\nCouncil), which was addressed by Ralph Dahrendorf on the\nsubject of Overseas students' fees. Trevor Phillips, President of\nUL U, told us of discussions which he had recently had with\nMPs. Another member of the Council reported on the ILEA meeting which he had attended that afternoon. They had decided\nRIDING\nWhat springs to your mind\nwhen \" Horse Riding\" is\nmentioned? Thelwel has a lot to answer for, for riding's image! Yet riding is an\nincreasingly popular sport as\nthe success of the recently\nformed Riding Club testifies.\nThe Riding Club first\nofficially came into existance at the end of last term and\nhas been growing steadily\never since to its present\nmembership of twenty-eight.\nTo quote its constitution, it\nexists\" to aid its members in\nthe art of horsemanship and\nthe promotion of a general\ninterest in riding throughout\nthe College, and also to\npromote competition between\nthe club and other clubs of\nthe University of London.\" Every Wednesday afternoon,\ntwelve members of the club\ngo to Trent Park Stables in\nEnfield, a large Riding School\nchosen because:-(i) it gives reduced rates\nto students,\n(ii) at the same time beginners\nmay receive lessons while\nmore experienced riders can\nride in the two hundred acres\nof wooded parkland that make\nup the Park. It is also possible to receive more\nadvanced tuition, which is\nquite popular, although it is\nat full rate. Thus Trent Park\nStables can run three different\ntypes of riding at the same\ntime, a valuable feature.\nHowever, such is the\ndemand that we are now\ninvestigating other riding\nschools in London with a view to running more than\none ride a week, and to\nbroaden our activities further.\nIt is also our hope to form\na riding team to represent IC\nin competition with other\nLondon Colleges and perhaps\nother Universities. Al lof this sounds expensive.\nYet riding need not be nearly\nso expensive a pastime as\nit is generally thought. Nor\ndo you need to possess\" full regalia\" to ride. So,\nif you have a pair of jeans\nand are interested, come\nalong and find out more about\nthe club any Thursday between\n1.30 and 2.20pm in room 407A in the Department of Electrical Engineering.\nAdam Rawicz-Szczerbo\nto cutback overseas student places by 60% by 1982, which we\nthought was a disaster since this would mean the closure of\nmany courses and several colleges. I spoke to Trev Phillips before the meeting began and he\nasked me whether it was true that Nick Brayshaw was standing\nfor President.\" I think I 'll just have to go back and stand myself\", he said. THURSDAY Having been up until 2.00am writing my report for\ncouncil and sorting out some problems in my lab report, I overslept and missed yet another lecture. But I managed to make\nmy assessment which went rather well. Today of course was the day of the Great Debate. Charles Clarke managed to speak for about 15 minutes without approaching\nthe subject. When I got up to speak it was hard to find anything\nto say since Pete Teague had already said it all, concisely, and logically as he always does. I hope that I managed to clarify\na few points and I hope Charles takes them to heart. The result\nwas, in my opinion, very satisfactory \u2014 the vote of about 360\nto 41 for the part of the motion expressing the view that NUS does not represent the views of its membership was better than\nI had hoped for, and the vote on d is affiliation surprised Charles by its closeness. I should just like to point out that the FELIX report was not quite correct in stating that those present voted\nto stay in NUS \u2014 in fact, the meeting voted that d is affiliation was\nnot the best way to chang a the Union. I hope that the Union officers\ncan interpret that as a mandate to change the NUS by other\nmeans, that is, by working through the inadequate but existing\nprocess. I relaxed in the evening by getting rather drunk before, during\nand after Guilds Revue. I made two mental notes while in the\nUnion bar; (a) it is about time that the Union bought the External\nAffairs Officer a pot, since the bar tends to run out of pint\nglasses when two C CU functions end up in the bar; (b)I must\nask John Downs to explain the technique of drinking a yard of\nale. FRIDAY \u2014 I thought this was to be a quiet day \u2014 nothing down in\nthe diary except for a Welfare committee meeting. But as soon as\nI entered the Union office at 11.30am, it all changed. Apparently\nChris Cullen, Andy Vallance Owen, Tony Brown and a few other\npeople from the Students for Representative Policies group had\nbeen studying their NUS direct action briefing, since they had\noccupied 3 End sleigh Street, the NUS Head Office. I was immediately on the phone: no reply from NUS, so I tried Brunei \u2014\nStopford had been up till 4.00am at vote counting and consequently\nhad not surfaced. So I rang Dave Hughes at Kings' and he gave\nme the story. I found a few useful people, that is, Messrs Barratt,\nSantilli and Housden and jumped into the nearest taxi crying\n\" End sleigh Street, please\". When we arrived, it was all happening.\nDue to a press leak, their move had been anticipated and so the\noccupiers had only held the ground floor. Everyone was there \u2022* all\nthe NU Shacks, the W RP, the CP,U CL Fascist Society, etc. It\nwas interesting to note that Clarke' s first reaction was to tell\nthe students that if they broke into the files, the NUS executive\nwould call in the police. Of course, the former is exactly the\nprocedure advocated by the NUS themselves l The protest\nessentially concerned the Bucharest bean feast o, and a copy\nof the 17 page communique was circulated. It was a nauseating as\nI had expected, full of the usual leftist clich es, and perhaps not\nin itself worth worrying about - but the NUS still have to justify\nwasting money on this sort of thing.\nNewspaper of Imperial College Union\nFELIX \u00a9 1976\nEditor\nPaul Ekpenyong\nPublished by the Editor on behalf of the Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board.

    "content": "FIU X5 Immediately after the N USd is affiliation debate last Thursday\nCharles Clarke\ntalked to Clive Dewey\nFELIX: Charles, what are your feelings\nabout today's debate?\nCLARKE: I thought it was fairly\nsatisfactory. I think it reflects the\nproblem that NUS has had for some time\nnow and that's getting across to\nstudents in ordinary unions what our\npolicies and activities really are. I think that was reflected in the first\nvote (IC voted overwhelmingly that\nNUS is unrepresentative). Obviously\nIm glad that the question of d is affiliation has finally put an end to it.\nWe are very keen to encourage\nmore active student involvement\nin their own unions, and of course\nat some stage we need to look at\nsome changes to the NUS constitution'.\nIn the last year we've seen great\nefforts to 'democrat is e' NUS. What\nare you and the Executive doing to\nprevent the shambles at Scarborough\ncaused by Alistair Stewart's misrepresentation of the Electoral Reform\nSociety?\nI don't think Scarborough was a shambles\nin the way you describe. The key thing we're trying to do to democrat is e NUS is to get across to the membership\nwhat the policies are and what's going\non. National Student is the most recent\nexample of this.\nWe are very keen to encourage more\nactive student involvement in their\nown unions, and of course at some\nstage we need to look at some changes\nto the NUS constitution.\nYou mention National Student, what\nwere your feelings on this month's issue?\nAlthough it was the launching issue, I was fairly pleased with it. It was strong in the most important respects,\nweak in one or two, but that's not\nsurprising. Generally I was very\npleased with it.\nAs regards news, do you think that a weekly paper will be a much more\neffective venture?\nThe main problem here is one of\nfinance. Ideally we'd like to get it on\nto a weekly basis, but I don't see that\nhappening for sometime yet.\nI think people will accept that the\nkey thing is to get the facts over\nto the membership'. That' s what the\npaper is about'. I don't just mean\nNUS facts, but news about the\nstudent movement as a whole'.\nDo you think the activists who attend\nNUS conferences will accept they cannot\nhave a campaigning newspaper and\nwill agree to finance the launching of a fact-based weekly?\nNational Student is a student newspaper.\nI think people will accept that the key\nthing is to get the facts over to the\nmembership. That's what the paper is about. I don't just mean NUS facts,\nbut news about the student movement\nas a whole.\nDo you feel that the prominence given\nby the press and others to the International debates is the cause of the\npresent 'disenchantment' with NUS\nthat you mentioned in the debate?\nThe International debates are certainly\namongst the most contentious and\nthus get more coverage in both the\nnational and student press. I don't myself feel that they take up a great\ndeal of the union's work. I think it\nis important to maintain our International\nlias on with other unions and our\ninternational activities on certain\npolitical questions.\nAre you trying to say that the disenchantment boils down not to what we\nfight on, but how we fight on the issues\naffecting students?\nThat' s always been an issue. I myself\ndon't believe that just by polite\nargue ment we can win the case. We\ncertainly need that polite argue ment, but we also need to be prepared to\nshow that students are backing that\nparticular claim. The only comment I'd make, is that\nin the areas one mentions, be it\nGrants, Overseas Students, whatever,\ninternational events do have quite\nan impact on what happens'.\n/ take it then that you believe NUS's first commitment is to its home students\nand that the press should focus more on\nNUS policy on Grants, Education, etc?\nI'd agree with that a hundred per cent.\nCertainly that is the main orientation\nof our policies. The only comment I'd make, is that in the areas one mentions,\nbe it Grants, Overseas Students,\nwhatever, international events do\nhave quite an impact on what happens.\nFor example if Denis Healey goes to\ndo an oil deal in the Middle East, then\nit has an impact on Overseas Students\nbecause he' s talking about deals on\nthat kind of thing.\nLet's talk about NUS's image. Do you\nthink its credibility could be enhanced\nto produce a more effective unified\nunion?\nThere are certainly measures which need to be taken. The disunity is essentially a feature of the current\npolitical position in the country. There\nis disunity, and there is no cover-up\njob I can do to hide that fact, and I wouldn't desire to. Because people\nhave different views as to how we\nshould deal with the economic problems\nfacing us.\"I myself don't believe\nthat just by polite\nargue ment we can win\nthe case.\"\nIC has a large percentage of overseas\nstudents. Could you perhaps tell us\nyour reaction and what NUS intends\ndoing about proposals to increase\noverseas students fees to over \u00a32,000\nper annum?\nWe are totally opposed to these proposals.\nThey will discriminate particularly\nagainst the 83% of students who come\nform the Third World and self-supporting.\nWe are organising a number of events;\nthe Overseas Students Day of Action\nhas already taken place, as have\nformal representations to the Government\nand Members of Parliament.\nNow that IC students have decided to\nstay in NUS, what would you like to\nsee them help NUS?\nThe most important thing for Imperial\nstudents to do is to get out and support\nthe campaign (grants). I hope that\nmeans on February 27th( grants\ndemonstration) they' ll come out and\nsupport it. Much more than that it's necessary for everyone at the debate\nto go out and argue the case with all those students who weren't at the\nmeeting. Then for the students in the\ncollege to take it out more widely into\nthe community and gain support there.\nThank you very much Charles.\nMy pleasure.\nSWIMMING GALA Tuesday, March 2nd at 6pm in the\nSports Centre\nAdmission 10p Free Beer afterwards!\nTo Enter: Seeyour CCU President\n\n"

In the\nquarter-final stages, Neil\nBinder and Mike Gibson\ncruised to a comfortable\nvictory over D Bales and\nAndy Devaney.\nThey were followed into\nsemi-finals by P Whitlock and J Hughes who won by default;\nA Gribble and K Freeman\nwho beat Alan Whatling and\nBill Jeffery in a very close game; and T Adey and I McDermott who came from\nbehind to win against Ian\nHall and Stuart Adamson.\nIn the first semi-final,\nWhitlock and Hughes won a comfortable first game against\nBinder and Gibson who\nbegan slowly and never\nlooked threatening. However,\nin the second game, both\npairs were more evenly\nmatched and only a fine\nfinish by Gibson gave him\nvictory over the other pair.\nBinder and Gibson won the\nthird game after establishing a clear lead. The second semi-final was less of a fire-cracker with\nAdey and McDermott scoring\nconsistently throughout and\nalso achieving the highest\nscore of the evening \u2014 138.\nThey eventually won 2\u20140 to\nreach the final.\nThe final, between two\npairs who had, until then,\nnever met in a game, proved\nto be an exciting match with\nA dey and McDermott beginning\nwell and running up a confident 2\u20140 lead although\nBinder and Gibson played\ncompetently. Binder and\nGibson however, avoided\ndefeat by sneaking home the\nwhitewash-beater with a calm double one in the third\ngame. In a high scoring\nfourth game, Binder slotted\nhome to square the match at\n2 - 2 .\nThe final game of the\nmatch see-sawed back and\nfourth until the penultimate\nthrow with Binder and Gibson on double one and A dey and\nMcDeimott on double two. The match was finally decided\nby Gibson who snatched\nvictory from almost ignominious defeat.\nPaul Whitlock\nChalky\ngets it\nJOHN WHITE, better known\nas Chal key, was elected\nas Honorary Secretary of\nIC Union at yesterday's Union meeting. This followed\nthe resignation of Mervyn\nPitchers from the elections\nlast Wednesday which left\nMr White as the only candidate\nrunning.\nThe Union meeting at\nwhich the main business of the day was the hu sting of\ncandidates for the sabbatical,\nDP and NUS delegate elections\nwas the most well attended\nto date. The meeting was\nlive red up by Mike Williams\nfalling asleep during the\npresidential hustings and then\nduring his proposal speech\nswearing at a certain member\nof the audience.\nUnion Bar Knickers\nScandal\nA PROPS AL by Mary Attenborough, Mathematics departmental representative, that\neach member of IC Union\nExecutive should donate a pair of their underpants to\nthe Union bar was narrowly\ncarried by 13 votes to 10\nwith five abstentions at the\nlast Union Council meeting.\nThe proposal was seen as\na\" if you can't beat ' em, join' em\" move in the latest\nround of the Union bar knickers scandal. Mr Teague, ICU President and chairing the\nmeeting at the time, inquired\nas to where the underpants\nwere to be placed in the bar.\nWhere upon Ms Attenborough\nreplied instantly \" On top of\nthe ladies knickers\". The recommendation is( not) to be\ncarried out.\nThe meeting however, did\ndiscuss less trivial matters\nthan this.\nDue to the large number of\nthefts recently from functions\norganised by the Union, the\nDP, after consultations with\nthe ICU Exec and the Ents Chairman, Andy Higman, has decided that only NUS members\nand guests of IC students\n(who must be signed in the\nguest book to be provided)\nwill be allowed into IC functions.\nThis measure will not be\nimplemented until next year.\nThe Working Party on\nUnion Response presented\nan interim report in which\nvarious short-term changes\nto the Union structure were\nproposed.A lengthy discussion followed which resulted in\nan open meeting of the\nWorking Party being called with the date yet to be\ndecided. This date will be\nwidely publicised and all\nmembers of the Union will be most welcome to air\ntheir views. Chris Kourouniotis how-ever, provided the sensation\nof the afternoon when he\nrefused to make a speech and\nanswer questions. This followed a proposal speech\nby Ms Attenborough in which\nshe attacked the election\ncampaign bump h of Mr\nEverett who is also a candidate for the post of\nDeputy President.\nThe polling days for these\nelections are on Monday 1st March and Tuesday 2nd March. Voting for the NUS delegation will be on the\nMonday and ballot boxes can\nbe found in the Union,'\nSouthside and J CR. There\nwill also be a roving ballot\nbox.\nSTOP PRESS\nELECTIONS\nNOTICE\nThe Returning Officer\nwould like to re-iterate. the\nfact that all the College wide ele c it on s are in the\nfoi m of a secret ballot.\nThere is no way of .con-firming that anyone person\nor group will vote for any\ncandidate. This comment has been re-iterated because\nsome candidates \u2022 have in\ntheir publicity been making\nsuch inferences.\nWARNING\nThe College Fire Officer has\ngiven strict instructions\nthat no-one is to go up on the\nroofs of the Union Building, Botany and Zoology department\nand Beit Hall during the\npancake race next Tuesday\nIf anyone is found on the\nroof, the race will be\nimmediately stopped and\npancake races on Shrove\nTuesday will be banned in\nfuture.\nIn addition the ICU Exec have\nwarned that no water is to be\nhurled around the Beit Quad\nbefore 12.30pm on Tuesday.\nThey are employing people\nwho will ensure that the\nabove two warnings are\nheeded. So be warned!\nSPORT\nDear Sports Readers, Sorry about the lack of\nsport this week fol les, but\ndue to lack of time (election\nbump h had to be printed) we\ncould not print a bigger FELIX to accommodate any more\nsports reports.

    "content": "4 EILL5\n( IstUw to t&i EAXUr\nAlfs Army amuse royalty\nSir, \u2014 May I bring to your\nattention the fact that the\nremark by Mr Richard Parker\n(ICU A AO) referring to the\n' Facade', of Alf' s Imperial\n(Pacifist) Army, of \"fighting\n\" high\" Christianity and to\nthe \" true metal\" yet to be\nrevealed, was utter nonsense,\nbased not just on a mis-understanding, but, apparently,\nan ignorance of fact.\n\u2022 The battle against the\nChristian Union, which\noccured during the CU mission week, was organised\nat the instigation of the\nCU themselves. Alf' s Imperial\nArmy (AIA) accused them\nhenceforth with practicing\nlow church evangelism after\nthe mould(!) of Billy Graham,\ncausing the mindless peasant\nmasses to stray from the\ntrue path of faith according\nto Charles I authorised\nversion. They disagreed. This conflict was resolved in\nbattle (pacifist type) where\nthe CU showed themselves\nto be of the true faith and a truce was called in good\nspirit and both war ing parties proclaimed their\nunited stance in the defence\nof the Faith and Propagation\nof the Word So much for the\n\" Facade of fighting \" high\" Christianity\". As for Alf' s\"taking over\nICU\", may I suggest you\nread an excellent article in\nFELIX No 412 by Mr Parker,\nin which he shows the IC\ncan be taken over by anyone\nwho can get \" 2 0 people who\nare willing to sign a piece of\npaper\", said piece of paper\nbeing a nomination for a place in ICU, supposedly.\nAnd, after all, at IC \" We substitute selection from a competent few with proscription\nof an unopposed few, so who\nneeds military take-overs\n(pacifist-type)?\nMr Parker also implied\nthat we are a threat to\ndemocracy in IC. May I remind you that we have,\non numerous occasions, declared our all eg ien ce to\nthe Crown, our support of\nthe principles of British\nConstitutional Government and\nthe legally elected Government,\nour ad her ance to the law and\nthe teachings of the Church\nof England. In addition we\nhave informed HRH Charles, Prince of Wales, of our\nactivities, who would, wrote\nhis aide, be \" most amused\" by them. Our patron the\nWizard of the Antipodes has\nalso pledged that we shall\ncease all activities if \" Her Majesty or Her Majesty' s Government or Her envoys or\nHer Representatives in the\nAntipodes So decide.\" Also Alf' s Army is based on\nprinciples parallel to the\nBoy Scout movement, and\nno-one regards them as a threat to democracy, surely!\nActually, I appreciate\nthat Mr Parker's comments on\nAlf' s Army (Imperialist-pacifist-fun-type) were probably made with the\ntongue in cheek attitude\nwith which we regard ourselves. If so I respect Mr Parker for\nhis insight and am glad at\nleast one person not in Alf' s doesn't take Alf' s Army\nseriously. However, Honour\ndemanded a reply!\nMay I just say one more\nthing, unconnected with what\nhas gone before?\nR CSU presented C CU with their shields, purloined\nmonths before. I see this as\na precedent for the return\nof our colours, captured by\nR CSU unarmed (arm less!) forces on Morphy Day '75.\nNaturally, the presentation\nwould take place with full\nceremony and Alf' s pacifist\ntype army would undertake to\norganise the colonisation' of\nany nearby rag objective in\nthe name of R CSU Rag '76, to\nthe great benefit of said\nnoble charity fund. I'm sure\ntheir wise and enlightened\nRCS press y would agree to this,\nbeing wise and enlightened,\n(and wanting to win the Rag\ncollections race) if it was\nsuggested to him. (I'm too\nshy).\nThank you for your kind\nindulgence.\nI am. Sir, your humble and\nobedient servant,\nIAN HOLIDAY( A1A)\nNUS non-debatable\nSir, \u2014 Regarding last week's d is affiliation nen-debate, for\nwhich the first motion was\nthat NUS is unrepresentative\nof the bulk of student members,\nfrom which the second motion\n(that d is affiliation is the\nbest way to counter this)\nwas meant to follow.\nI call it a non-debate\nbecause the first motion,\nwhich underpins the whole\nd is affiliation argument, is\nby nature a non-debatable\nissue. Whether or not the\nNUS represents its members'\nviews is a matter for systematic\nresearch, and no amount of\nrhetorical assertions which\nmerely beg the question, or\nmerely deny it, is going to\nconvince me one way or the\nother.\nClearly what is needed is\na properly conducted survey\nof the opinions of a representative sample of students.\nComparisons between student\nopinions and NUS policies can then be made, and\nsensible conclusions can\nbe drawn. Opinion polls may\nnot be infallible, but they\nare patently more dependable\nthan these 'finger on the\npulse of the people' arguments.\nYours faithfully\nCRAIG DUNANT El ecE ngU G2 Sir, \u2014 I would like to make a few points regarding the\nfarcical debate I attended\nlast Friday on NUS.( i) The misunderstanding\nwhich resulted in the failure\nto attend of one of the speakers\nwas unforgivable. Whoever\nmade the arrangements should\ntake the b lame for not checking with Mr Minnis either by\nletter or telephone. Thus,\nthe debate was already\nunfair and heavily weighted\nin Mr Clarke' s favour.\n(ii) All credit must be\ngiven to Pete Teague for\nspeaking for the motion, at\nsuch short notice. I think\nmost students would agree\nthat he spoke much better\nthan Charles Clarke, who\nmanaged to avoid the motion\nfor much of h is speech\n(iii) The major event of\nthe meeting was the voting\non the second part of the\nmotion, whether or not to\nd is affiliate. From my position,\nthe voting looked approximately\n5 0 - 5 0 , or possibly a slight\nmajority to d is affiliate. Obviously most people agreed\nwith me, as when the result\nwas read out; there was\nstunned silence. I am sure\nthe counting of the votes was\ndone with complete sincerity,\nbut is not this method of\nvote counting liable to error?\nI am sure nobody present\nexpected such a difference\nDeputy President\nanswers critics\nSir, \u2014 I was very interested\nto see a letter of criticism lodged against me in FELIX No 4 f2 and would like to\ntake this opportunity to\nreply to these criticisms. Indeed the Union is for\nthe students, for all of the\nstudents, and I would hope\nthat they make as much use\nof Union facilities as possible. However, as DP, one of my\nmain responsibilities is the\nUnion Building and this\nincludes discipline within\nit. If, at any time, members\nof a particular club or\nsociety are found to be\nmisusing the facilities or behaving in a manner\nother than that which is\nreasonable, then I am\nempowered to take such\nsteps as are necessary to\ndeal with the situation.\nOn this occ as sion, due\nbetween the totals.\nConcluding, a secret\nballot would -be the fairest\nway of solving this issue\nonce and for all (well, for a few years at least). This would provide the true,\ndemocratic result, and stop\nall the uncertainty, which\nhas gone on this year. Please, Mr Teague and company,\ncould not this be arranged\nbefore the end of term?\nYours faithful ly.\nJ STUART MatRs I to the unreasonable attitudes\nof certain members of the\nSnooker Club who failed to\nproduce their Union cards on\nrequest, I had no choice but\nto close the room. I would\ntherefore not agree that\nMessrs Mills and Latter\nwere deprived of Union\nfacilities because of \" a personal grudge\" between\nthe above people and myself.\nI would remind Messrs\nMills and Latter that the\nsituation was fully explained\nto them when they accosted\nme in the Union bar on the\nsame evening. Surely they\nrealise that it would have\nbeen a complete contradiction\nto allow them the use of the\nsnooker tables after having\nclosed these facilities down\nfor the night and especially since the incident had yet\nto be resolved with the\nappr opiate parties.\nDespite this, I would\nreiterate my apologies to all\nUnion members who were\ninconvenienced by this\nregrettable action.\nIn conclusion, I would\nlike tn point out that I was misquoted in so much as\nI did not say \"the innocent\nalways sutler\", but that\n\"unfortunately, some innocent\npeople always suffer through\nthe actions of the inconsiderate\nfew\".\nYours sincerely\nRI ZSH A KIR Deputy President\n\n"

Coup de Cologne\nCOLOGNE UNIVERSITY won this years Hyde Park\nRoad Relay and so, for the\nfirst time in its 28 year\nhistory, the winners\ntrophy goes abroad. The six man team covered the\neighteen mile course (each\nrunner completing one\nthree mile lap) in a time\nof 85 minutes 23 seconds.\nThe last team home, in a time of 125 minutes 17\nseconds were the courageous\nand dogged team from\nMons University in Belgium.\nFor their valiant effort,\nand for coming last for\nfour consecutive years,\nthey were presented with\na wooden spoon at the\nend of the tea-time presentation ceremony.\nLater in the evening,\nwhilst attempting to rock a car across Queens Gate\nthey were caught in the act by a passing police patrol\ncar. Two members of the\nteam, unable to make a sufficiently fast escape\nwere apprehended by the\nLaw and taken to the local\nstation. There they became\nunable to understand English and were discharged without\ncharges being made.\nBlood..'.\nExactly100 teams began\nthe race at three o' clock on\nSaturday at the start in\nRotten Row and 97 teams\nfinished. According to one\nseasoned runner, the ground\nwas very hard and the\nlong straight section on the\nnorth side of the Se'r pen tine was . . . unpleasant. This was because runners were\nable to see the course\nstretching out in front of them\nfor miles and miles.\nSixteen Continental Universities from Belgium,\nWest Germany and the\nNetherlands competed in what is, for IC,a prestigious\nevent. Birmingham University,\nthe favourites to win were\nunable to attend due to the\naffects of flu and the loss of Ron Smedley to an International Championship match.\nThe start of the race \u2014 far left captain of the Cologne team and\nsecond from the right lan Ellis, IC Captain.\nThe race was started\nvery informally with a quiet \" are you ready ... Go\" from one of the officials. In the first three laps the\nlead positions changed\nradically each time runners\ncame to the end of a lap. However, after the fourth\nlap, six teams emerged as\ncontenders for the leading\npositions. Sweat...\nThey were Lough borough College's A and B teams, Durham University, Borough Road College, Manchester University and\nCol log ne University. Over\nthe duration of the race the\nlast lap set out over 20\nminutes after the race had\nbeen won!\nThe lap record was\nequalled for the third time\nin as many years by David Moorcroft of Loughborough\nCollege A team. He covered\nhis lap of 2 miles and 1740\nyards course in in 13 mi nut21 seconds and won the\nmedal for the fastest runner\nin the competition.\nToil... The Union building provided\nvery cramped changing\nand showering facilities for competitors. It was in\nthe Union Dining Room that\nMr Teague, de put ising very capably for Lady Flowers who unfortunately\nwas ill, presented the medals\nand trophies to the winning\nteams. The Lady Roderic Hill Cup for the winning team\nwent to Cologne University.\nThe Steve Webb Trophy for\nthe second fastest team went\nto Loughborough College A team. The Imperial College Union Cup which is awarded\nto the fastest team from a college with under 500 male\nstudents went to Borough\nRoad College who came fourth\nin a time of 87 minutes 17\nseconds. Medals were\nawarded to each member of\nthe trophy winning teams.\n...and beer.\nCongratulations are due\nto the Imperial College Cross\nCountry Club, their executive\ncommittee and especially to Rich Harrington for\norganising the event with\nsuch efficiency. The Road Relay has become an important\nevent in most British and\nsome Continental Universities calender s and will hopefully\nremain so. Oh by the way, the IC contingent came 24th.

The next post in the ICWA\nhierarchy, if such a term can\nbe used for so informal an\nassembly, is that of the\nTreasurer without whom no\norganisation can hope to\nfunction smoothly. The job is\nnot difficult but is vital, it is an excellent training\nfor aspiring accountants!\n(And thats 25% of the ICWA\nmem ber ship.)

I would, however, like\nto elaborate on the role of\ndep reps as not only do they\nlet the departments know what\nthe committee is doing, but\nthey also provide the essential\nfeedback from the departments\nso that the Association's activities reflect the needs\nand wants of its members.\nThe need for this cannot be\nstressed enough. The dep\nrep's role is a key one,\nbut sadly, in the past, people\nholding these posts have\nfailed to realise this. Only\nwith dep reps can ICWA\noperate to its members best\nadvantage so, if you stand for\na post please remember this\nand play a full part in the\ndecision making and\norganising.\nAs you can see from the\nabove each post is interrelated and the whole thing\ninvolves a lot of team effort.\nStanding for a post, winning\nit and then not pulling your\nweight is letting both your\nfellow committee members\nand ICWA at large down.\nWhat I would like to see\nIC Astronomical Society present\n\"The Amateur and his\ninstruments. \"\nan illustrated lecture by\nERIC MOBS E BY, F.R.

She talks to\nIan Morse about the musical\ndirection she has taken since\nleaving the rock scene at the\nheight of her fame.\nTHE YEAR WAS 1968. The band was\nthe Brian Auger Trinity, and \" This Wheel's on Fire\" had hit the charts\nwith a bullet! The girl who fronted the\nband looked a wild, totally emancipated\ncreature, with a clear, biting tone to her\nvoice. She had just been voted 'Brightest\nHope' in the Melody Maker poll, and\n'great things' were being predicted for\nher. She was Julie Driscoll. The Trinity at that time were a hugely popular outfit, especially on the\nContinent, where ' Jools' was regarded\nas something of a cult figure (sic).\nAnother single followed, \" Road to\nCairo\", together with an album \" Open\", and her success seemed guaranteed \u2014\nwhen suddenly, to the great surprise of\nthe majority, she seemingly just packed\nher bags and walked out on the rock\nscene altogether. Apart from a brief\nencounter with acting, when she portrayed\na hitch-hiking hippie wench in one of\nthose social comment plays, popular\nwith the BBC at the time, it was the\nlast mass media ever heard of the girl.\nIn 1970, she released an album \" 1 9 6 0 \" ,\nand married pianist/composer Keith\nTippetts, since then Julie has been\ninvolved with the British avant e garde/\nfree music scene.\nJulie Tippetts and I are chatting in\nthe office of some big wig at RCA House. On the walls are splattered\ngold and silver discs, most of them\nawarded for the work of the Sweet. She\nmakes me a cup of coffee, but I notice\nshe's not drinking her's. This makes\nme suspicious \u2014 after all is not this\nthe very same female who's witch-like\nappearances on Top of the Pops, scared\nthe daylights out of impressionable\nsmall boys, back in '68? Does she\nlike people who write about her? Well,\nshe' s smiling a lot and these days\nlooks almost angelic, with not a trace\nof the facial paint work that epitomized\nthe late sixties epoch. I decide to cast\nfate to the wind, and start my '20\nQuestions' routine. So why did you\ndecide to opt out of the rock scene in\nthe first place?\n\"I definitely needed to get out; I couldn't have carried on with that way\nof life, it became unreal. I wanted to\nbe involved in things that were real\nand honest, and I found that I was in\nfact living a bit of a not dishonest\nexistence, but an unreal one. And I really had to get out of that\".\" Before I met Keith I hadn't really\nlistened that much to people like\nArchie Shepp, although I was always\ninterested in those sort of fields. It\nwas just a matter of having them sort of\nlaid on me, you know. Of course\nAuge(Brian Auger)was always interested\nin jazz and he was always open to\nthings, so I suppose I was drawn a bit\nthat way. But then my musical tastes\nare pretty broad, that's why I think an\nalbum like 'Sunset Glow'( her new\nrecord) \u2014 portrays a lot of the things\nthat I feel musically, instead of being\nin one sort of area\". What of her acting\ncareer? I remember he getting favourable\ncritical response at the time. Did she\nreceive offers of other parts?\n\"I did, but I don't feel drawn towards\nacting. It's a matter of channelling\nmy head somehow or other into one\ndirection, and music seems to be it.\nI 've never studied,but then I 've never\nstudied music as such either, but that\nseems to be the one that's taken its\ncourse throughout my life, so that's the one I 've to actually stick to.\nAnyway, I don't think I 've got that\nkind of front anymore, to get into\nacting, you know. I mean you start\ngetting involved with acting and you're\nacting, and I think that can sort of\nrub off on your own life; and I want\nto get involved with things that are\nnatural and honest.\" It was in 1971 that husband Keith\nunleashed into the world his magnum\nmasterpiece, 'Septober Energy', performed\nby the fifty-odd piece Centipede. Julie wrote the lyrics, and played with the\noutfit on all their too-few gigs. (Incident-ally there are plans underway to\nre-float the musical whale, after a successful performance in France, just before Christmas. Mr Tippetts is\nat present, busy writing a few short\npieces to be included with ' Energy'. By this time the lady was fully engrossed\nin the avant e garde, and has been\ninvolved at various stages of Spontaneous\nMusic Ensemble's lifespan, the group\nled by alto is t, Trevor Watts and\ndrummer, John Stevens.\nIn late 1973 Jools sang the poetry\nof Paul Haines on American composer\nCarla B ley's acclaimed work, 'Tropic\nAppetites'. How had she come to be\ninvolved in the recording? \"It was\nIrene Schweitzer (Swiss pianist)\nreally, she knew Carla, and Carla said\nshe needed a vocalist. Then she wrote\nto me and asked if I was interested in\ndoing it.\"\nHow did she feel about the way the\nalbum was produced?\n\" They weren't finished tapes even \u2014\nit was a bit hard,\" she emphasises.\n\"I mean, I was originally going to go\nover there (America) to do it, but as it\nwas I learnt the things from tapes that\nCarla had sent over, and did it like\nthat. I must admit Iha v n't played it\nthat much, I think its turned out a bit\nlike it actually was recorded \u2014 a bit\ndisjointed, perhaps not as flowing even\nas Carla would have wanted it, because\nit was done bit by bit, and I don't feel there was an actual flow about\nit. But, that could be because of\nmyself. I probably would have liked\nto have participated a bit more than just\nsinging the actual parts and songs\nas such, so that could be an unfair\ncriticism of the album, it could be\njust from my point of view\". We talked for a while about the\nfree music scene in London. Did she\nhave an opinion on why in this country,\nthe music had not achieved the media\nacceptance it enjoyed on the continent?\n\" There doesn't seem to be much\nroom f or it really, does there? I don't know, when you go to places like\nGermany and see just what a unity\nthere is between musicians \u2014 it's crazy that there's not something\nhappening like that here \u2014 there always\nseems to be a block put on it. There's not the outlet on radio for a start,\nmaybe it's even down to being a small\ncountry. I really don't know, and yet\nit's there \u2014 it's all there, it just seems\nthat people don't know where it is;' The new album came about as a result of her long friendship- with\nproducer Giorgio Gomelsky, who had\nfirst 'discovered' Julie Driscoll singing\nin an office while she was secretary of\nthe Yardbirds fan club, in 1966. He had\nrecently been getting a new record\nlabel together (Utopia) and asked if she\nwas interested in doing anything for it.\n'Sunset Glow' is the result.\nI find the record surprisingly easy\nto listen to, compared to say, the\nexperimental work she has recently\nbeen involved in with S ME. Was this a conscious attempt on her part to reach\na wider audience?\n\" No, it wasn't an attempt to do\nanything like that really, other than I suppose to put together all the things\nI 've learnt musically, it felt very\ncontinued on page 9\n\n"

Born in\nthe Ukraine, Borochov took\npart in the Socialist movements\nin Russia around the turn of\nthe 20th century, spent ten\nyears in political ex il s after\nhaving been imp r is i one d for\ntwo years, and died an\nuntimely death in Russia in\n1917 on the eve of the\nRussian revolution.\nBorochov analysed the\nJewish problem in Marxist\nterms. He noted that although\nthere was a large Jewish proletariat, its role was\nmarginal, this being in the\nnature of the occupations.\nThe economic structure of\nthe Jewish people in Eastern\nEurope, compared to other\nnations, was abnormal,\nespecially in that Jews were\nusually not employed in the\nprimary means of production.\nAn example is that whilst\nmany Jews might be cobblers,\nfew, if any, were farmers\nand kept the calves from\nwhich the leather was obtained\nIn other words, even if\nvast numbers of Jewish workers went on strike, the\nimpact on the national\neconomy would be negligible.\nFurther, even if Jews tried\nto move to other spheres of\nactivity, there would be\nresistance from the existing\nGentile labour force, resulting\nin emigration, amongst other\nthings.\nThe only solution to\noccupational redistribution\nand economic normalisation\nwas the concentration of\nJews in a national homeland:\nPalestine. This would then\nbecome the base in the\nfight for a Socialist society.\nIsraeli society today is\ndominated by three main\nIC Ground\nCommittee AGM\nThurs 4th March\n1.00pm Great Hall\n(prior to UGM)\ngroupings that grew out of\nthis Social ist Zionist movement,and a representative\nof one of them was recently\nwelcomed by IC Jewish Society as speaker. Nahum\nSneh of \" Map am\", the\nUnited Workers Party, spoke\nabout the development of\nLabour Zionism. He dealt\nwith the aspects already\nmentioned and went on to\ndiscuss the attitude of his\nparty to Palestinians. Essentially, it has always\nrecognised Arab Palestinian national rights in Palestine, side by side with Jewish national rights, but rejects\nsome of the currant PLO ideas because they would\nreduce the Jews to a second\nclass religious minority. He pointed out the oft-forgotten\nfact that already Weizmann\n(a chemist who later became\nthe first president of Israel)\nhad conceded that part of\nthe Palestine problem lay\nin the clash of two rights.\nArab leaders did not\nseize the chance to rise up\nagainst British colonialism, but the Jewish battle against\nforeign domination reached a climax in the War of\nIndependence in 1948/9.\nFinally Nahum Sneh felt\nthat an old saying still holds good: \" Zionism is the\nnational liberation movement\nof the Jewish people\". To put the Mapam party\ninto political context, I would like to add that in\n1974, after the last Israeli\nelections, Mapam provided\ntwo Ministers out of a Cabinet of twenty-one, whilst\nthe Israel Labour Party\nprovided fourteen. As far as\nthe stand of the party is\nconcerned, Sneh described it\nas approximating to the\nBritish left-wing \" Tribune\" group.\nDORI SCHM ETT ERLING SKIING!!!!!!\nIC Ski Club weekend in\nAviemore\nMarch 13th14 th Cost \u00a319.50, Ski hire: \u00a34.50\nSki pass: \u00a33.50 per day\nIf you want to come along to\nthe final meeting on Tue s24 th Feb at 1.00pm in the\n\" Room at the Top\"( IC Union).\nFor further details, see the\nClub notice board \u2014 right\nhand side of Union Building. WELLSOC\nLighter than air flight\nANTHONY SMITH, the well\nknown journalist and\nbroadcaster, gave an absorbing\nlecture on the subject of\nballooning and \" How to\nBuild Your Own Airship\". He explained the situations\none should not get into when\nballooning, or rather landing\nafter the flight, such as\navoiding being charged by\na rhino; this he discovered\nwhen he was landing in the\nSerengeti National Park. One\nof the problems in flying over\nremote areas is that one must\nbe in contact with one's ground crew \u2014 the alternative\nis a long walk!\nMr Smith and his friends\nhave the distinction of being\nthe owners of one of the\neight airships in the world.\nThey built it themselves, and\nhe talked amusingly about\nthe red tape they ran into with\nthe civil aviation authorities,\nand then went on to explain\nabout the technical difficulties\nthey encountered. One problem\nwas that in effect they were\nstarting from scratch as the\nliterature which existed\nfrom the \" Golden Age of\nairships\" was very specialised, and hence they had not\nbeen use to his group until\nthey had obtained some\npractical experience.\nHe concluded by saying\nthat in general there was\na great future for airships\nin cargo handling.\nNext summer, his group\nhope to test their airship in\nBrazil. Apparently this is\none of the best places to\nfly. At the end of the lecture,\nMr Smith made a small\nrequest. Anyone want to\nbuy an airship?\nHolidays for deprived\nchildren\nARRANGEMENTS are being made to send four children to\nthe United States for a month's holiday at a Y.M.C.A. Summer\ncamp. The camp is charging them no fees as these children\nare in care,-are all from deprived families and have never\nhad a holiday. To make this trip possible \u00a3500 must be\nraised to pay for their airfares.\nThe problem of raising \u00a3500 is proving more difficult\nthan was first believed possible. The venture does not\nseem to fit into the right category for donations for most\ncharitable foundations to make a contribution.\nApproaches have been made to travel companies but so\nfar only brochures with the appr pri ate price lists have\nbeen returned.\nIt would be a great pity if the holiday had to be cancelled and the generous offer from the camp refused. The camp\nis the Ralph S. Mason camp in New Jersey 70 miles from\nNew York. It is a mixed camp for about 300 children aged\nbetween eight and fifteen. The facilities are superb. There\nare opportunities to take part in a wide range of sports,\nincluding canoeing, archery, boating and riding; and there\nare many other activities, such as art and crafts, photography and music.\nIt is a marvellous opportunity for the four children\nconcerned, and it is disheartening that it has received such\na negative response from all the organisations that have\nbeen approached for help. Especial ly as it was hoped, if this\nyear's was successful, to organise the scheme on a permanent\nbasis. If you know of any group of people or organisation who\nmight be interested in contributing or raising funds, then\ncontact T.C. Mer nick le, Mech Eng Dept, Imperial College. It does not have to be in the region of \u00a3500, all offers for\nhelp in raising funds will be appreciated. Karen Gadd\n\n"
