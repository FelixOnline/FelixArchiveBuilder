    "content": "\u2022LETTERS:\nOUR Social apathy\nDear Sir,\nWe are writing to draw the attention of the\nhall residents (Weeks, Tizard, Keogh and\nFalmouth) about the apathy of their social\nclub chairmen none of whom could be\nbothered to even acknowledge the formal\ninvitation, for an inter-hall table tennis tournament, sent to them by Linstead social\nclub chairman, sometime during the last\nterm.\nWhether this is due to their inability to\ncope with their duties or some unknown form\nof inferiority complex (Linstead after all is\nnumber one). We are going to place them in\nthe bottom of the league if there is no reply\nwithin one week.\nSincerely yours\nS Cochester\nNaseei Ahmad\nLinstead Hall\nNorthern\nIreland\nDear Sir,\nIn last weeks issue of FELIX, Cathsoc\nmade an appeal for an end to the prevention\nof terrorism act, in line with Sein Fein (IRA)\npolicy. Before the readers start writing to\ntheir MP's as suggested by Cathsoc, I feel that\na few more points need to be considered.\nFirstly, it should be remembered that one\nof the main reasons for the acts existence is to\nhelp protect the people of Northern Ireland\nfrom the continual onslaught of violence\ndirected at them by the IRA, UVF, INLA and\nall the other psychopaths who have plagued\nthe province for the last fifteen years.\nSecondly, the people of Northern Ireland\nhave repeatedly endorsed this policy and\nindeed have called for increased protection\nagainst terrorists. I find it difficult to believe\nthat the government could be justified in\nremoving the small amount of protection\nthat has been granted so far.\nLet no one be in any doubt that the\ncampaign against the prevention of terrorism\nact is seen by the people of Northern Ireland\nas a part of the wider cam npa ign of violence\nbeing waged against them.\nCertainly a political solution must be\nsought in Northern Ireland but whilst the\nterrorists are still killing them the\ngovernment are obligated to protect the\npeople.\nHaving read this article you are urged to:-1 Inform yourself (as widely as possible) on\nthe views of the people of Northern Ireland.\n2 Write to your priest (or minister) asking\nhim to speak out against tacit support being\ngiven to the terrorist by various 'concerned'\ngroups.\nYours faithfully\nDavid Kirk\nCollege\n'out of touch'\nDear Sir,\nThank you for your coverage of the\nabolition of the Joint Honours (Bio)\nChemistry/Management Science course. The\nabsurdity of this decision is unparalleled.\nThat the College Board of Studies has given\nin to the Chemistry department shows how\nout of touch College is from the outside\nworld, as well as current students. You only\nhave to read how College sells the joint\nhonours course in the 1985/6 IC prospectus\nto see how ridiculous the Board of Studies\nhas been:\n'The need for scientists to be well versed in\nmanagement techniques has become evident\nin recent years. Surveys of graduates working\nin industry and the public sector indicate that\nmany assume managerial responsibilities\nrelatively early in their careers, and even\nthose who remain scientists spend an\nincreasing amount of their time on\nmanagerial functions...\n...Comparisons of British science degrees\nwith those on the Continent show that\nmanagement subjects play an important part\nin the curriculum of the courses in Europe.\nThus the need for management education is\nnow strongly emphasised by industry and\ncommerce as well as by government bodies'.\nThe real reason why the director of\nundergraduate studies in Chemistry has\nswapped the course is that when the twelve or\nso students leave the Chemistry department\nbefore the third year, the money the\ndepartment can claim from government\nsources goes down. Elementary logic then\nsays, if you stop the students changing\ndepartments, then the Chemistry department\ncan claim more (as government grants are\nproportional to the number of third years)\nand so it gets richer!\nThe claim that s ut dents can just do an MSc\nin Management Science if they are so inclined\nis, as is widely known, not valid: Only 15% of\nthe MSc students in Management Science\nhave managed to get grants.\nHoping that this matter will be raised when\nthe UGC visits IC,\nYours sincerely,\nJohn Hartz\nDept of Man Sci\nFELIX\nIt has always been the platitude of the Estates\nSection to say that 'the welfare of the students\nis the prime consideration'.\nThe Estates Section, headed by Mr DW Clark, is responsible for the maintenance of\nthe College buildings and halls of residence.\nThe Willis Jackson affair (see front page)\nraises a number of important questions.\n\u2022Why did the Estates Section allow the\nhouses in Evelyn Gardens to deteriorate so\nmuch in the first place?\n\u2022 Why was Michael Arthur told only last\nweek that students must be re-housed, when\nEstates knew eight months ago?\n\u2022Why will the work on Willis Jackson not\nstart until March 1985? Could it not have\nbeen done over the Summer vacation in 1984?\n\u2022In what sense can the welfare of the\nstudents be said to have been of prime\nconsideration when they are compelled to\nmove house during their exam revision?\nI doubt that we shall ever know.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to\nGrenville, Ajay, Nigel, Pete, J Martin, Hugh,\nHugh, Dave Jones, Richard, Tinker, Finian,\nGary, Jeremy, Chris, Pete H, Pete C, Farah,\nJudith, Duncan, Patrick, Rosemary and\nTony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed bythe Union Print\nUnit, Imperial College, Prince Consort Road, London SW7.\nTelephone 0\n1\n-5\n8\n9 5111 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1985.

When it does\narrive, lists will be posted on the Photosoc\nnoticeboards for both colour and black and\nwhite demonstrations, as these had to be\ncancelled last term.\nThis will also enable you to get on with\nprinting for the big competition. The main\ncontest will require a portfolio of three or\nfour (maximum four) of your best photos,\nreflecting your diversity, artistic merit, or j photographic skills (only one portfolio per\nentrant). This is not a printing competition,\nso print quality and printing techniques will\nnot be essential features. Obviously, they will\nenhance the finished photo, through. Both\nblack and white, and colour prints (not\nslides) will be considered, but black and\nwhite preferred, as colour prints do not\nreproduce very well, (a selection will be\nprinted in FELIX and Phoenix). Size is\nunimportant, though again, larger prints\nhave a greater impact, generally.\nThe competition will be judged by a committee (not the Photosoc committee),\nand there will be prizes of \u00a310 and \u00a35\nvouchers from Jessops, for first and second.\nThe test will also be printed in FELIX and\nPhoenix. It is open to any Photosoc member,\nand is an ideal way to enter your first\ncompetition.\nThere will be a subsidiary competition on\nthe theme of 'Christmas' (which gives you\nquite a wide scope, really).

    "content": "EFEATURE FEATURED\nThe National Union of Students\nholds biannual conferences at which\ndelegates from most student unions\nin the UK meet to decide the Union's policy. Since IC Union is not in the\nNUS, students at Imperial rarely\nhear much about the work of the\nNational Union, so J Martin Taylor\nwent along to the Christmas\nconference held last term in\nBlackpool to report on it and give his\nimpressions to FELIX readers.\nThe train arrived at Blackpool nearly an hour\nlate and hundreds of students swarmed off,\nheading for their hotels then the elegant\nsplendour of the Winter Gardens. Once\nthere, a long queue snaked along the foyer\noutside the conference hall as delegates\narriving late waited to register and obtain\ntheir all-important badges and cards before\nbeing allowed in to see the NUS President,\nPhil Woolas, make his opening speech. They\ncouldn't fail to hear him anyway since the\nconference proceedings were being relayed\nthrough the public address system in the\nfoyer. Posters and leaflets promoting an\nastonishing range of political viewpoints and\nhighlighting the world's trouble spots were\nadorning every square metre of wall space\nand being eagerly thrust into every hand.\nThe first impressions of the Conference\nexceeded my expectations. I knew that in\nstudent politics this is the main event, the\none no-one who's anyone can af fort to miss\n\u2014 but this was a political jamboree to end all\npolitical jamborees. Even those who detest\nthe organisation, from both sides of the\npolitical spectrum, could not bring\nthemselves to stay away.\nThe disruption that was to be the most\nnotable feature of the next few days began\neven as the Conference started with the set\npiece opening address, which was mainly for\nthe benefit of the press. Any delegate can, at\nalmost any time, go to a microphone and\nraise a point of order and if 50 delegates\nsupport him or her then they get a minute's speech. Since at least 50 people always\nseemed to put their hands up as a reflex\naction, any irrelevant or looney speech could\nbe made. Not surprisingly there were often\nqueues at the microphones to make such\nspeeches. The particular issue to upset\ncertain delegates even before conference\nbegan was the suspicion that the bouncers\nemployed by the NUS to police the\nconference were non-union is ed and had\nmade sexist remarks to female delegates.\nAfter the opening session the Conference\nsplit into three sector conferences for Friday\nevening and Saturday morning. The sectors\nare: Universities; Public Sector Higher\nEducation (PSHE), ie polytechnics; and\nFurther Education (FE). Each has its own\nnational committee (for which elections were\nheld at this Conference), and debates and\nadopts its own policies.\nThe most notable event of these largely\ntedious proceedings was the near riot caused\nby the appearance at the Universities sector\nmeeting of the Under Secretary of State for\nHigher Education, none other then our very\nown Peter Brooke. Mr Brooke had been\ninvited, along with Tom McNally of the SDP\nand Andrew Bennet of Labour, to speak and\nanswer questions from university delegates.\nImmediately he appeared on the platform\nthere were shouts of 'No Tory Scum' and a group formed in front of the platform\nshouting and screaming at Mr Brooke.\nDespite repeated requests from the chair the\ndemonstrators, the majority of whom were\nnot university delegates, refused to leave or\nremain silent. As Peter Brooke attempted to\nspeak a loud haile r was produced to prevent\nhim being heard. Tom McNally addressed\nthe Conference over the heads of the\ndemonstrators, warning the NUS that it\nThe NUS Executive on the platform during the Conference Photos: J Martin Taylor\nmust overcome this type of behaviour if its\ncase was to be heard properly. At this point a jug of water was thrown at Peter Brooke,\nafter which the chairperson ad jou red the\nConference and left the platform along with\nthe MPs.\nThe Conference was only returned to\norder after Phil Woolas took the chair and\nthreatened to expel the demonstrators from\nthe entire Conference if they continued. The\nuniversity delegates supported his in closing\nthe sector conference to delegates from\nother sectors. The debate with the three\nMPs finally went ahead, with Mr Brooke\nstruggling with many of the questions he was\nasked. He was forced to admit that student\ngrants had been cut contrary to promises\nmade by Mrs Thatcher in 1978, and that\nsome students might not be able to complete\ntheir courses as a result of the latest cuts.\nThe other two MPs had an easy time\nattacking the government although they\nseemed a little sketchy on facts with some\nquestions. Overall, Tom McNally probably\ncome out best.\nOf the other sector conferences the main\npoint of interest was the continuing assertion\nof the FE sector. One speaker at the FE\nsector meeting condemned NUS as the\n'National Union of University Students' a sentiment which echoed the general feeling\nof FE delegates. The NUS is having to look\nmore and more to this sector which\ncomprises around 500 of the NUS's850 student union members. Policy on Further\nEducation was later adopted by the whole\nConference, and FEs are pressing for a larger share of NUS's resources and for\nbetter representation on the Executive.\nSaturday afternoon and evening were\ndevoted to Commissions. These are small\nmeetings of interested delegates held to\ndiscuss particular sections of the Executive's report. I attended sessions on Sport,\nEntertainments, Services, Postgraduates\nand Racism and Fascism. Altogether over 40\nCommissions were held, at each of which an\nExec member responsible for that area of\nwork was present to answer questions and\nrebuff criticism. Most of the time the Exec\nwere on the defensive, finding it hard to\nprove that anything concrete had been\nachieved. The standard way of making it\nappear you've done something is to organise\na specialist conference on the subject \u2014 it's probably possible to attend one such\nconference almost every weekend\nthroughout the year!\nThe idea of the Commissions is to smooth\nthe way when the Exec Report is put to the\nwhole Conference on Sunday. This may\nhave worked, or it may be that so much time\nwas wasted on points of order that delegates\nwere too concerned that there may not be\nenough time to debate their pet motions that\nthey didn't want to waste time questioning\nthe Exec Report. Either way, the Exec got off\nextremely lightly since many sections of the\nreport were wish y was hy to say the least.\nTUCsE-WTS\nSUPPORT THE\nPICKET\nTHE. - RoyAL SCHOOL OF M/ iV VE ARE CR^ a niz j/^ A SAinVj AFRICA S Arx African/ em sassy Picket Wednesday(2*05:1S Kews/A/(5nT) NJ TU&E S7/^JC>M1P'a OKU,\ns.o. Ci-rt;\nTms i ti&m fen*\nEb\nPoster at the Conference about the RSMU\nbar night - note the spelling!\nThis is a pity because, to my mind, the\nReport should have been the most important\ndebate at the Conference. The most notable\nact of dissent ion was whilst the Endsleigh\nInsurance part of the report was being\ndebated. Four Endsleigh banners hanging\nfrom the balconies around the hall were\npulled off by demonstrators to show their\ndissatisfaction with the 'NUS name for\ninsurance'. This section of the report was\nreferred back.\nTwo guest speakers were heard during the\nConference, chosen by a ballot. The first was\na speaker from the Polytechnic of North\nLondon (PNL) about the Harrington affair,\nand the second was Betty Heathfield, wife of\nthe NUM General Secretary. These\nspeakers reflected the two issues which\ndominated the Conference most. I had\nexpected the miners' strike to be most\nprominent, but even this was eclipsed by the\nPNL dispute. This was mainly due to a fierce\nargument between PNL student union and\nthe NUS Exec over the best way to achieve\nthe agreed goal of 'No Nazis on Campus'. In\nthe end the emergency motion on the issue\nwas amended to reflect the Executive's view.\nThe debate on the miners' strike didn't provide much ground for dissent ion. The\nmain contention was whether to give \u00a31000\nor \u00a320,000 to the striking miners. The option\nsupported by the Exec (\u00a31000) was passed.\nNo anti-NUM speech was heard and the only\nanti-NUM amendment was not debated due\nto lack of time.\nOther motions debated were on the NUS\n'New Deal for Students' (basically a souped-up grants claim), the Grants Demonstration\non 28 November (criticizing the Exec for\npoor organisation) and Student Financial\nSupport. In general a lot of time was spent\ndiscussing the differences between\nmoderate (ie Labour) and more left-wing\namendments which called for such things as\naffiliation to the TUC, support for ultra vire s payments disregard for the law and\nmobilization of students in a joint struggle\nwith the working class to overthrow the\nbourgeois establishment to end repression of\nstudents and workers (or something similar).\nThe latter were routinely defeated.\nOne other notable decision by the\nConference was to end individual\nmembership of NUS for students at colleges\nnot in NUS. If ratified at the next conference\nthe dozen or so IC Union members who have\njoined NUS on this basis will lose their\nmembership. This step has been taken to\nemphasise the NUS's status as a federation\nof student unions, rather than an individual\nmembership organisation. This is in\nresponse to allegations that NUS is a 'closed\nshop' made during some re affiliation comp a ign s in Scotland.\nThe Conference was marred by\ndisruption, intimidation and occasional\nviolence. The conflict existed almost entirely\nbetween right-wing members of the\nFederation of Conservative Students and\nextreme left-wing Trotskyist groups such as\nthe Revolutionary Communist Party. Both\nwere present in insignificantly small numbers\nin terms of votes, but only a few people can\neasily cause a lot of disruption. The FCS\nmembers deliberately provoked the Trots,\nwho responded predictably. The tactics of\nFCS caused them to be shunned not only by\nthe Conference as a whole (when they were\nmaking election speeches nearly everyone\nstood and turned their backs on them), but\nalso by moderate Conservatives led by NUS\nExec member Chris Davies, who formed a separate organisation to work at the\nConference, with some success.\nThe NUS is at present completely in the\ncontrol of the National Organisation of\nLabour Students (NOLS) who have\nsuperceded the cross-party Left Alliance.\nHowever, like the Labour party, NOLS is in\nthe throes of a. fierce internal power struggle\nbetween the 'Democratic Left' (Kinnock-style Labour) and Militant, as well as other\ngroups. In addition, there was much\nevidence of general dissatisfaction with the\nNUS leadership from many at the\nConference, particularly the FE sector\n(amongst whom Militant is strong). How\nthese factors will affect future control of NUS\npromises to be interesting at least.\nIt wasn't possible for me to go to the\nConference with a completely open mind\nsince several years of involvement in student\npolitics has provided me with some\nknowledge of its workings. Before I went I was impressed by some of the work the NUS\nis doing, although I was concerned that much\neffort (and money) is wasted on irrelevant\nissues. The Conference explains a lot.\nBasically, the useful work NUS does\nhappens in spite of the Conference, the\nirrelevant work because of it. The whole\nthing costs around \u00a3200,000 but I can't see\nthat any useful purpose was served or that\nthe work of the NUS was helped very much.\nIt's great fun, if you enjoy that sort of thing,\nbut at a cost of \u00a320,000 for IC Union it just\ncan't be worth re affiliating.6 Friday 18 January 1985\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022PUZZLES\nTinker\nThe puzzles this term will be a little easier than last, so that more\npeople can have a go at them. The first puzzle falls easily into\nthis category.\nFour Heads of Department have decided they can stand it no\nlonger, and have decided to end it all with a one-way visit to the\nQueen's Tower. Each Head faces the tower, which is 70yd s away from them, in the directions N, S,E&W. Sadly, although each has read a great deal about the history\nand architecture of the building, none recognise it in front of\nthem. After a few moments' thought each decides that it would\nbe easiest to follow someone else, hence turns to the person on\ntheir left and follows them at 1yd/ sec.\nIf they are to reach the tower at all, how long will it take them\nto do so ?\nSolutions to the FELIX office by Wednesday.\nNow for the three remaining solutions to the Christmas\npuzzles.\nThe problem of connecting the six matches was solved as\nindicated.\nThe paper-folding puzzles were folded as follows, and is one\nentrant pointed out, are considerably easier to solve than to\nfold, draw or explain.\nSlide butt through to dotted line, then press flat.\nTuck corner in slot whilst folding 1/2 boundary, then put V section behind 2.\n4\nNow to what everyone agreed was by far the most difficult\npuzzle. The answer to the sphere cutting problem is NO.\nI received three different solutions to the problem. One\nargument was of a similar order of complexity to mine, one a great deal easier, my admiration goes to the inventor of the third\nmethod which was apparently to draw out the majority of the 42\nsegments by hand.\nI give ava rien t of the most elegant method sent in by Jeremy\nSmith of Physics III\nWe begin with a sphere centred on(0,0,0). If we cut this with 3\nplanes X=0,Y=0 and Z=0 each doubles the number of pieces\nleaving us with 8 pieces. The 4th cut, however, can only cut 7of the 8 pieces. The single point generated by the 3rd cut must\nprevent at least one segment from being cut. This may be\nproved with the following argument.\nThe said point may be considered as cutting in half each of\nthe 3 lines that pass through it.\nSince the 4th plane may only cut each line once, there will be\nthree half lines uncut by the 4th plane.\nThese three uncut lines bound a segment which cannot itself\nbe cut by the 4th plane.\nThus each cut can at best double the number of volumes,\nminus the previous number of points.\nAs we cut the shape we increase the number of points by the\nprevious number of lines and increase the number of lines by\nthe previous number of planes.\nHence the maximum number of segments may be tabulated\nas follows.\nPLANES/CUTS LINES POINTS VOLUMES\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 2\n2 1 0 4\n3 3 1 8\n4 6 4 15\n5 10 10 26\n6 15 20 42\nThis gives the maximum number of segments less than 43.\nIt seems likely that since all four completely different\napproaches gave the same maximum of 42 segments, that six\nplanes are indeed sufficient to cut a sphere into 42 segments. I would be interested to hear from anyone who can show this can\nactually be done, and hence whether this really was the\nquestion of life, the Universe and everything!\nPrizes\nThere were seven correct solutions to both the area\ndissection and the folding puzzles.\nDAVE CRUST a Physics PG and TONY CHURCHILL the\nFELIX printer were the winners.\nTo the volume puzzle there were five solutions, JEREMY\nSMITH of Physics III was the lucky winner.\nThree people managed the volume dissection puzzle, and\nthey all gave correct solutions to the six other puzzles as well.\nPETER BEARDWOOD of Chemistry won the \u00a310 prize for his\nseven correct solutions and although he generously offered any\npossible winnings to the famine appeal, he remains at liberty to\ntake his cheque and do with it as he sees fit.\nJeremy Smith won the prize for the volume dissection puzzle\nbut as he had already won \u00a35 he kindly donated his prize money\nto the only other person to get all the puzzles right without\ngetting a prize: M Moutoussis of Physics I. What a nice lot!\nFriday 18 January 1985 FELIX\n\n"

A notice was\nobtained that will close the\nbuilding unless the repairs are\ndone. Despite the fact that the\nCollege then knew by the middle\nof the summer that the work was\nrequired and the building would\nneed to be emptied, residents\nwere only told last week. Mr\nDonald Clark, Estates Secretary,\nclaimed that negotiations with\nthe Royal Borough of\nKensington and Chelsea, and the\nsystem of allocating contracts,\nmeant that the warden and\nstudents could only be informed\nsix weeks before work started. As\nall the student houses are built to\nthe same standard they are all\noutside the regulations and the\nlocal authority has the power to\ninspect and obtain writs for all\nthe properties. Mr Clark said that\nthe local authority was being 'not\nunreasonable', and no further\ninspections appear to be planned.\nThe residents of number 66\nEvelyn Gardens have delivered a letter to the FELIX office, with\ncopies to Ian Bull and Michael\nArthur, Student Services Officer,\nclaiming that the Estates Section\nwas behaving in an 'arb it ary and\nunfeeling manner'. They have\nnot been informed of the move in\nwriting or told where they will be\nmoved to. The work, costing\nmany thousands of pounds for\nthis small part of Evelyn Gardens\nalone, will start in March and last\nuntil the summer, disrupting the\npreparations for the summer\nexams of other Willis Jackson\nresidents. Michael Arthur also\nonly found out about the work\nlast week, although he stresses\nthat all the students being moved\ncould be found places elsewhere.\nThe contravention of Housing\nRegulations highlights the state\nof the property in Evelyn\nGardens. A backlog of repairs\nhas built up, including dry rot,\ntiles falling off walls, problems\nwith water heaters, leaking roofs,\nand other major external repairs,\nalthough Mr Peter Hallworth,\nManaging Surveyor (Residence),\nstressed that the structure of the\nbuildings was still basically\nsound.\nThe Halls of Residence\nContents Insurance states that\nthe College must keep the\nproperty 'in efficient condition\nand good care' and take 'all\nreasonable precautions to\nprevent loss, damage injury or\naccident'.\nMr Clark pointed out that his\nSection is very short staffed. He\nblamed the leaking roofs on dead\nbirds getting jammed in rainwater guttering.\nNew video\nThe College has commissioned\ntwo video films, one to attract\nhome and overseas students and\nthe other to obtain industrial\nsponsors for research.\n'Many universities are now\nusing video films to supplement\ntheir prospectus', said a representative of the company\nmaking the films.\nBudget\nraised\nThe distribution of the Science\nBudget for the next academic\nyear was announced last week in\nthe House of Commons by the\nEducation Secretary, Sir Keith\nJoseph. The rise of nearly six\npercent on last year's figures is\nlower than expected, because\nextra cash was needed to fund\nstudent grants.\nThe Natural Environment and\nMedical Research Councils have\nbeen worst affected with\ndecreases in real terms. The\nScience and Engineering\nResearch Council (SERC) like\nthe Economic and Social\nResearch Council have had their\nallocations increased by a modest\nsix-and-three-quarters percent.\nThe SERC are delighted that they\nare receiving more money\nalthough the increase is seen as\ninadequate. The extra cash will\nbe used to fund new top-quality,\nor alpha-rated, university\nprojects. There is no indication of\nan increase in the number of\nstudentships.\nRector ill\nLord Flowers was admitted to St\nStephen's Hospital on Tuesday\nfor tests.\nThe Rector, who has not been\nwell recently, is expected to be\naway' for up to three weeks. He\nwill be convalescing out of\nLondon, and members of the\nCollege have been requested not\nto write or telephone. His doctor\nhas ordered complete rest.\nProfessor Swanson, the Pro\nRector, will be undertaking the\nRector's duties during his\nabsence.\nFlowers, 60, is leaving the\nCollege this year to take up his\nduties as Vice Chancellor of the\nUniversity of London.\nFour members of the Computing Department recently took\nfirst prize in the European Finals of the Association of\nComputing Machinery (ACM) programming competition.\nThey will go on to take part in the World Finals in New\nOrleans, USA on March 13.

The\nfirst concerned changing the\nword Chairman to Chairperson,\nand the second sought to remove\nall other sexist references: Both\nchanges were defeated and the\nmeeting closed, without the\nquorum being challenged, after\nonly fifteen minutes.\nCard sharp\nBe warned if you have a Midland\nAutobank card.

The cleverer\nNat West computer remembered\nthe extra day but penalized\nMidland customers by retaining\ntheir cards.\nThe, error has now been\nrectified, but if you used your\nAutobank card to obtain money\nduring the first week of January,\nit will still be retained by\nServicetill.

    "content": "REVIEWS^\nSINGLES\nElvis and the Jordainaires:\nElvis Medley\n50 years after Elvis' birth,\nthis is the most tasteless\ncommemorative single I have\never been subjected to. The\nonly possible reason to buy it\nis the B side's original version\nof 'Blue Suede Shoes'.\nThe Associates: Breakfast\nThere was a time when it\nseemed the whole world\nexcept me were in love with\n'Party Fears 2' with this new\nsingle it seems like most of the\nworld except me dislikes it. I can't win! The piano playing is\nluxuriously brilliant, and at\nlast, the vocals have stopped\ngrating. As a 'breakfast' this is\nlike croissants and coffee,\nrather than toast and muesli \u2014\nSunday morning music.\nRah Band: Are you Satisfied?\nEver since Matt Bianco\nburst into the charts with a unique brand of soul-jazzing\nlast year, other artists have\nbeen trying to emulate their\nsuccess. A moody little piece\nthis one, a bit Radio 2, but /\nlike it. I find it best in bed with\ndim lights and a glass of\nchilled white wine. Try it!\nPointer Sisters: Neutron\nDance\nSaw the excellent video of\nthis at the flicks last week (it's advertising the new Eddie\nMurphy movie). Ever since\nthen, my feet have been\ntapping every time I hear it.\nThe fifth single from 'Break\nOut' I find it quite incredible\nthey can release such\nconsistently high quality\nproduct. Besides, I just love\nthose sultry voices.\nLinda Ronstadt: Falling In\nLove Again\nLoathe as I am to admit to\nliking the music of Ms\nRonstadt, this return to the\nsound of the 20's from her\nalbum 'Lush Life' and\nfeaturing the Nelson Riddle\nOrchestra, is simply superb.\nFlipped with the vocally erotic\n'Sophisticated Lady', this\nsingle is three minutes of\nundiluted mmm mmm. H20: You take my Breath\nAway\nCan't wait to see the video\n'cause the picture sleeve has a photo of a break dancer, and I just can't imagine breakdancing to H20. Good song\nthough. Heavily overproduced by Bob Sargent,\nthis could be the one to bring\nthe band back to the top of the\ncharts. Then again, it\nprobably won't!. THE A TRE\nScrape off\nthe Black\n'Scrape off the Black', by\nTunde Ikoli; Dir.: Alby James\nat The Arts Theatre, Leicester\nSq. till 2 February and then the\nAlbany Empire (6-9 February).\n'Scrape off the Black' is the\nfirst play in the GLC's second\nBlack Theatre Season; a festival\nthat attempts to make the West\nEnd audience aware of the talent\nof black actors, writers and\ndirectors involved in many of\nBritain's fringe theatres. The\nfestival hopes to bring three new\nproductions together:\n\"Vigilantes', by Farruk Dhondy,\nThe New Hardware Store' by\nEarl Lovelace, and, at present,\nTunde Ikoli's new play\nperformed by Temba Black\nTheatre Company.\nThe play set in the mid 70's concerns itself with the\nproblems faced by the half-caste\nchildren of a mixed marriage in\nthe 50's both with regard to their\nsociety, but more particularly\nwithin the family unit. It deals\nextensively with loneliness,\nwhich none of the characters\ncan escape from. Trevor (Ben\nOnwukwe) is the obvious victim\nof emotional starvation ('Does\nshe love me? DO YOU?',\n'Course I do, I'm your mother1), but the problem runs deeper\nthan that, as isolation is passed\nfrom mother to son, from son to\ngrandson.\nAs an example of Black\nTheatre, I sense the issue of\nracial politics (which reached a climax about this time) is used as\na means (rather than the end) to\nfocus on intense, but not\nnecessarily related family\nproblems. If the author had laid\nthe emphasis upon the subject\nof illegitimacy, with an all black\nor all white cast in mind, the\nmessage in the play would still\nhave been as relevant.\nThis is no slur on the play of\ncourse. Indeed, this is an\nexample of black theatre in\ndirect contrast to current trends\nin the media (especially\ntelevision) to deal directly with\nracial conflict: apartheid in\nforeign countries, police\nrelations with minority groups.\nThe acting throughout is\nexcellent, particularly from Rose\n(Catherine Terris), a pathetic\nbingo addict and hypo cond ria c. Whether the festival achieves its\naim remains to be seen, but\n'Scrape off the Black' is certainly\ngoing in the right direction.\nJohn Burgess\nFELIX Friday 18 January 1985 9\n\n"

Indeed,\ntradition breaking does not stop there, we have a far larger orchestra then ever before, and highly\nambitious staging, far beyond any of our previous\nattempts. The revolutionary aspects do not stop\nthere. Our production is very different in itself with\nGilbert's highly complex plot cunningly simplified\nby our producer Ellis Pike.\nA scene from last year's production, lol an the NEW CHAMBERLAINS REQUIRED\nAs we still have a month to go, we desperately\nneed help building set and front of house, if you are\ninterested, please feel free to come to the Concert\nHall any weekend, or contact the Chairman, Gary\nAtkins via Chemistry II UG Mail Racks, or any\nOpsoc member. If you want to help, or find out what\ngoes on behind staging a production, now is your\nchance to find out.\nTICKETS AT LUDICROUSLY LOW PRICES\nAs you can see tickets are once again a snip this\nyear. Please buy your tickets early to avoid\ndisappointment. We will be selling tickets every\nlunch fi me in level 2 Sheffield from 4 February. We\nhope to see you at what promises to be one of our\nbest ever shows.\nSCANDALOUS PRODUCTION\nIf you saw our production of lol an the you will\nknow our attempts to modernise the setting, and\nwe have done it again, with the show set in 1930's Germany in the mythical state of Pfennig\nHalbfennig, presided over by Grand Duke\nRudolph. The plot involves a planned revolution by\nmembers of Ernest Dummkopf's Theatrical\nCompany overthrowing Rudolph but things go\nhopelessly wrong \u2014 but that's giving the plot\naway... The score includes much of Sullivan's best\nand most exciting choral music, with a dramatic\nduel in the first act, and adi thy ram bic dance in the\nsecond.\nAnother feature of lol an the was the design of the\nfemale choruses costumes, but Duke's costumes\ngo further with everyone in unexpected dress\nthroughout.\nTHE GRAND DUKE\nBY GILBERT & SULLIVAN\nIN THE UNION CONCERT HALL TUESDAY 12TH SATURDAY 16TH FEBRUARY\nAT 7.30PM EACH NIGHT\nTICKETS \u00a32.50 (\u00a32.00 STUDENTS)\nFROM: THE HALDANE LIBRARY, OPSOC MEMBERS\nON THE DOOR, THE OPSOC ROOM3 RD FLOOR UNION BUILDING\n8 Friday 18 January 1985 FELIX\n\n"
