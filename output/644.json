    "content": "Luba's Bistro\n6 Yeomans Row, SW3\n589 2950\nNot having found a suitable recipient for a really bad review in recent weeks, I decided to\ntry Luba's. Situated off Knightsbridge, vaguely opposite\nthe Brompton Oratory, the interior evokes\nmuch of the charm of a Siberian dentist's waiting room.\nStarters cost from \u00a30.90 for corn on the cob\nto \u00a31.85 for spiced herring with sour cream.\nWith a sense of masochistic glee, I plumped\nfor Kapoostniak\u2014braised cabbage with\nIREVIEWS\nprunes and sour cream. The inspiring name\ntogether with the revolting combination of\ningredients suggested a sure fire failure. I was\ntherefore most disappointed to find myself\ntucking into a very tasty and spicy concoction\nwith the added bonus of being able to play,\ntinker, tailor, soldier, sailor with the prune\nstones.\nMy companion ordered Piroshki\u2014minced\nbeef and egg wrapped in a pancake and deep\nfried, \u00a31.40. This was also judged to be\nexcellent.\nA good rule of thumb for determining\nwhether or not a restaurant is expensive is the\nChicken Kiev test. This ubiquitous dish is a useful pointer because it offers little scope for\nvariations. Some may be a little bigger or be\nserved with a few more chips than others, yet\nprices vary enormously. Luba's Chicken Kiev\nat \u00a35.25 puts it well into the extortionate\nbracket.\nNevertheless, main course prices vary from\n\u00a31.95 for spaghetti to \u00a36.25 for steaks.\nSpaghetti at \u00a31.95 was rather dull but an\nadequate portion. The Chicken Supreme,\n| however, at \u00a32.95 came in an over salty\n; glutinous sauce which verged on the inedible.\nPuddings start at \u00a30.95 for yoghurt with\n\\ honey. We both went for Luba's special\nI Sernic, \u00a31.30, which consists of cream cheese\nand raisins wrapped in a pancake and served\nI with peaches and cream. This was delicious.\nAn unusual feature of Luba's is that you can\nbring your own wine. This means that instead\n| of paying \u00a34 for revolting, un drinkable wine in\nI a restaurant you can buy some revolting,\njun drinkable wine for \u00a31.73 from an off-licence\nI and take it with you. As a way of cutting down\nI the cost of eating out it has much to\n:\nrecommend, but one suspects that because\ni enormous profits are not being made on the\nwine, there is a compensating mark-up on the\nfood.\nThe bill for two at Luba's came to \u00a311\nincluding service\u2014a result achieved by limiting\nchoices to the cheap end of the menu.\nAlthough by no means the best value for\nmoney around, it is sufficiently interesting to\nbe worth a try.\nFilm\nReviews\nHandgun, Cert 18, directed by Tony\nGarnett showing at ABC Shaftesbury\nAvenue.\nChauvinism is apparently not dead, but:\nalive and well and living in Texas. Obsessed\nwith their frontier image this is a macho state\nwhere a man can still be a man and the\nwomen are grateful for it, or at least the men\nthink so. Into this red-necked society comes\nKathleen (Karen Young) who finds life a bit\ndifferent from her Boston upbringing.\nThis is essentially a serious film which\naddresses itself to the problems of chav in ism, attitudes to rape and gun law, but at the\nsame time builds to a tense climax and is\ncompetently performed throughout.\nTo a non-Texan, and especially a non-American, the attitude towards guns is\nfrightening and this film is quite timely as there\nis a growing lobby in the States to do\nsomething about the huge numbers of guns in\nprivate hands. Texas was chosen, obviously,\nas an extreme example. At one point Kathleen\ndecides to buy a gun, and her instructor from\nthe local club takes her along to the local gun\nstore. This place is not some discrete little\nemporium specialising in hunting rifles and air-rifles for junior to try and assassinate sparrows\nwith; this place is reminiscent of a large arsenal\nand looked like it could outfit a fair proportion\nof the US Army. T shirts, that medium of\nmacho ag it prop display anti-gun law slogans\nand the radio relates moral little tales of the law\nof the West; why bother to turn a burgle r in,\nwhen you'd derive more satisfaction by\nblowing him away with your nice little\nshotgun.\nThe result of all this mega machismo is that\nKathleen's easy-going New England ways are\ntaken as 'the green light' and when she resists\nshe is raped at gunpoint by her boyfriend who\nobviously believes this is what a man would\nhave done in the ol' days, before welfare\ncheques and health care. The police are loth to\nact: this is Texas, juries rarely convict, she\nasked for it. So, in the tradition of the old west,\nKathleen decides she must take revenge\nherself and learns to use a gun with\nsingle minded determination.\nThus we have a fairly standard format of\nattack and revenge, but the ironies of the\nsetting raise it out the humdrum. It is a piercing\nfEu x w mt mmm mmm mmm mm look at a society in love with the gun: they\nwiped out the Indians with it and now they'll\nuse it however they choose. Among this\nsociety armed to the teeth are the survivalist s' who long for the return to the wild west and\nthe collapse of civilisation so they can emulate\ntheir heroes, wear the badge and be the\narbiters of life and death. Perhaps life is bad\nenough for the world beneath the shadow of\nan old third rate actor who'd like to be John\nWayne. Beware a president from Texas, he'd probably think he was John Wayne, charged\nto run them com mies out a town.\nEducating Rita, Cert 15, directed by Lewis\nGilbert, starring Julie Walters and\nMichael Caine. Now showing Classic\nHaymarket and Warner West End.\nThis is the film of the successful stage\ncomedy by Willy Russell.\nThe Rita of the title is a twenty-six year old\nhairdresser from a Northern working class\nneighbourhood. She is married to Denny, who\nwants to start a family, but Rita does no*: want\nto have a baby until she has 'found herself. In\nan effort to do this she enrolls on an Open\nUniversity course because, as she says, she\nwants to 'know everything'.\nThe task of 'educating' Rita falls to Frank a disillusioned academic who is causing concern\nto his colleagues by arriving at his lectures in a somewhat inebriated state. On his first\nencounter with Rita he tells her 'all I know is\nthat I know nothing'.\nWhen Denny discovers that Rita has\nI secretly been taking the pill, he burns all her\nbooks. Given the ultimatum to stop studying\nor leave, she leaves.\n[ Soon she is sharing a flat with Trish, a i cultured extrovert who is not quite as carefree\nas she seems.\nAfter attending Summer School, Rita\ndiscovers that she is now on equal terms with\n\u2022 the other students and is soon in great demand\nwith the 'proper students'.\nThis change in Rita frightens Frank as he\nthinks she is losing her original personality and\nbecoming 'academic is ed'. When he challenges\nher she replies 'What you can't bear is that I'm educated now. I 've got what you have and you\ndon't like it\u2014because you'd rather see me as\nthe peasant I once was. I don't need you. I 've\ngot a room full of books, I know what clothes\nto wear, what wine to buy, what plays to see,\nwhat papers and books to read. I can do it\nwithout you.' Frank asks her if this was all she\nwanted; 'Have you come all this way for so\nvery, very little?'\nRita has achieved what she wanted. She js\n'educated'. But that doesn't seem so important\nto her now. She has other things to think\nthings to think about.\nThis is a charming film, well worth seeing\n(even if you've seen the play) and strongly-recommended.\n\n"

    "content": "Free Accommodation\nNext Year\nDoes the idea of not having to pay for your accommodation next year\nappeal to you? If it does have you considered becoming a Head Tenancy\nWarden or Manager?\n\u2022 Managing a Head Tenancy\ndoes involve a fair amount of\nwork but most of all it requires\nan interest in Residence and a commitment to making a particular Head Tenancy a success.\nThe Head Tenancies include\nHamlet Gardens, Lexham Gardens (maybe), Earls Court\nSquare, Gerrard Mansions and\nthe Fremantle Hotel. Each of the\nHead Tenancies belongs to an\noutside landlord and is leased to\nthe College for one to three years\nat a time.\nWe are now looking for a Warden who will have responsibility in respect of all of the\nHead Tenancies and there are\nalso vacancies for Managers in\nsome of the individual schemes.\nThe Warden is based at\nHamlet Gardens where a self\ncontained flat is available. As\nwell as running Hamlet Gardens\nwith, the help of a Manager, the\nWarden is responsible for\narranging meetings with all the\nHead Tenancy Managers and\nrepresenting them on the Students' Residence Committee.\nThe ideal candidate for this\njob would be a postgraduate\nwith at least two more years to\ngo, who has some experience of\nthe Head Tenancies and some\nwell developed ideas on how\nthey could be improved.\nIncidentally, the accommodation would be suitable for a couple, so applications are\nwelcome from couples as well as\nfrom single students.\nThe Manager's job is more\nspecific and can be considered\nunder three headings:\n1. Domestic\nBefore Residents move in the\nManager is responsible for\nmaking a note of the readings on\nall gas and electricity meters, so\nthat any bills sent to students\ncan be verified. The Manager is\nresponsible for checking Residents in at the beginning of the\nsession and giving out keys.\nThroughout the term, various\ndomestic supplies such as bin\nbags, cleaning materials and\nlight bulbs are required. The\nManager is responsible for\nobtaining these from the College\nStores.\nIn those Head Tenancies\nwhere cleaners are employed, the\nManager should ensure that this\nis properly carried out.\nThe landlord is usually responsible for the majority of\nrepairs but because repairs cost\nmoney a Manager will soon\nlearn to detect just the slightest\nhint of reluctance in the landlords manner when the question\nof repairs is mentioned. Nevertheless, it is the Managers job to\nreport defects to the landlord\nand encourage him to rectify\nthem.\nAt the beginning of each\nsession Managers should collect\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nAccommodation for Next Session\nA substantial amount of accommodation can now be\nbooked for next session.\nSingle and double rooms in Grenville Place SW7 and\nPhilbeack Gardens, SW5. Singles \u00a318-26.50pw; doubles\n\u00a319-20pw. Flats situated in Fulham and South Ken. There are flats\nfor groups of 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8 and 10. Rents are from \u00a323-25\neach per week.\nFor further details contact Student Services or ring the\nowners direct: Mr Christian 385 9882 or Mrs Belforte 731\n0292.\nIMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nSYMPHONY\nORCHESTRA\nConductor:Richard Dickins\nSoloist: Anna Meadows\nRIMSKY KORSAKOV Capriccio Espagnol\nMOZART \u201e r, Bassoon Concerto\nGLAZUNOV Symphony No 5\nWednesday May 10th The Great Hall Opm\nTickets \u2022 \u00a31 (students 75pJ from: Orchestra Members\nHaldane Library\nThe Door\na list of all existing defects. This\nis partly to prevent the new\ntenants being blamed for damage caused by the previous\noccupant.\n2. Finance\nThe Manager is responsible for\ncollecting the bills and bill\nreminders from Student Services\nand delivering them to the\nstudents. Prompt action is\nessential in this area. Managers\nare also expected to chase up\noutstanding bills.\nIn some Head Tenancies,\nManagers have to empty gas,\nelectricity and telephone meters.\nOccasionally at the beginning\nof the session, the Managers\ncollect any unpaid deposits as\nstudents move in.\n3. Social and Discipline\nMuch of the Head Tenancy\naccommodation is in the form of\nflats, which tend to generate\ntheir own social life. Others are\nmore like Student Houses where\nit is very important to give the\nlead in organising social events.\nIn all the Head Tenancies the\nManager is responsible for\nmaking sure that no nuisance is\ncaused to neighbours and that\nno damage is caused to the\naccommodation. Managers need\nto have a weekly 'clinic' where\nresidents can report defects and\nwhen other matters can be dealt\nwith.\nAlthough this description\nmakes being a Manager look like\na full time job, in fact it is not as\nbad as it sounds.\nMost things only have to be\ndone once or twice a term and\nare not particularly time con-sum ing. Nevertheless, these jobs\ninvolve a high degree of responsibility and commit t ment and if you are thinking of\napplying you will need to talk to\nyour personal tutor or supervisor before doing so.\nThe work tends to be concentrated into specific periods such\nas the beginning of term (par-ti cula rly in the first term).\nExperience has shown that\nresearch students find it easier to\nreconcile the management role\nwith their academic work.\nThe job can be demanding at\ntimes. Student Services is able to\nhelp with many problems but the\nManager is often left to his own\ndevices.\nNevertheless it provides an\nexcellent opportunity for anyone\nwho is interested in Residence to\ndevelop administrative and\nmanagement skills.\nIf you are interested, more\ninformation is available from\nStudent Services. The closing\ndate for application is May 27.\n\n"

    "content": "Anything For A Choired Life\nWhat a hard time musical organisers are going\nto have next week in Primelia College! The\nWind Band are doing the '1821' Concert on the\nsteps outside the Queen's Arms on Tuesday,\nthe orchestra are doing a concert on\nWednesday and on Friday the Choir take over\nthe Great Hall.\nThe Wind Band ex-committee (Dune U Verymuch, Chris Taltipps and Mike Entuckyhome) have decided that putting out more\nthan twenty-five chairs is too much for them,\nso on the Queens Lawn, 25 chairs will be put\nout in a5 x5 square.\nHere comes the difficulty: the choir, headed\nby Erich von Braun, and the orchestra, led by\nRich T Biscuit, will, between them, be sending\na party of four people to listen to the concert.\nThe people from the choir only sit on high\nchairs, while the orchestra members only sit in\narmchairs. In the traditionally over-organised\nstyle of Music Society, the party have been\ntold that they must sit in a2 x2 square, in a certain pre-set seating arrangement, and the\nWind Band have been told that this 2x2 arrangement of seats must appear in their 5x5 arrangement of seats. Unfortunately, no-one\nhas told the Wind Band how many choir or\norchestra members there are (eg they could be\nall choir, three choir, one orchestra etc), and\ncertainly not what the 2x2 seating arrangement is (ie for three orchestra and one choir\nmember, there are four different arrange-ment s). Fortunately the committee have found an\narrangement of armchairs and high chairs so\nthat, no matter what the party is, they can be\nsat down without moving any chairs.\nCan you give a sample pattern that will\nsuffice?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35 from\nMend-a Bike for a randomly selected entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nBombed Out\nThe maximum number of garlands needed is\n10. Its necessity is shown in the two diagrams\n(the second of which was shown by the great\nalgebra is t Sylvester), and its sufficiency was\nshown by the argument submitted by Elizabeth\nBerry, a physics PG, but since the argument is\nrather tedious, I don't propose to write it out\nhere.\nThe winner this week was Tim Pigden from\nMan Sci, who can collect his \u00a35 prize from the\nFELIX Office after 1:30pm on Monday.\nA Slice of the Pi\nIn this week's Footnotes, there is no puzzle; I shall simply suggest a definition, and a few\ndeductions, then suggest a few questions, and\nprint anything interesting that comes up.\nA definition of pi for a polygon could be:\npi = Perimeter\nwidth\nwhere the width of the polygon is defined as\nthe greatest distance between two points on\nthe perimeter. This definition works best for\nconvex polygons (ones for which all interior\nangles are less than 180\u00b0).\nConsider a triangle sides a,b,c, with a the\nlargest of the three. The greatest distance\nbetween any two points is clearly the longest\nside so:\npi = a+b+c a Therefore, for a triangle, pi ranges from\n2 (b+c=a) to 3 (a=b=c). What can you say about four sided\npolygons? What shape polygon maximise s pi? Is there a general rule for the maximum\nvalue of pi (eg for maximal pi for a polygon\nof n sides (call it say pin, is it true that\npin is always greater or always less than\npin-l)? Tell me about pi!\nWMKABOVT100KSH\nby MtMe Optics Inc.\nThe process of lithography was invented by\nAloys Senefelder in 1798: the artist uses a grease crayon, or liquid grease, to apply an\nimage to a granular surface\u2014originally\nBavarian limestone, now more often an alloy\nplate. The surface is then dampened and\ninked: the dampened surface rejects the ink,\nbut the greasy image retains it and carries it, in\nturn, to a sheet of paper. Commercial\nlithography developed during the 19th century.\nBy the 1880s it was common practice to photo-sens it i sea lithographic plate and transfer an\nimage to the plate by light, through a half-tone\nscreen. Offset lithography was achieved by\n1900: the image is transferred from a curved\nmetal plate to a rubber blanket and then to a sheet of paper. The rotary principle not only\nspeeds up production but enables the image to\nbe set down the right way round on the plate,\nrather than reversed as in the direct process.\nOriginal versus Reproduction\nThe jargon term is 'offset-litho', as in FELIX, as.\nin glossy magazines, as in posters and book\nillustrations. There is no technical reason why\nthese should not be 'original' prints\u2014the\nreason is the snobbish desire of the print\nmarket to perpetuate art patronage as an\nesoteric pursuit open only to a moneyed elite.\nAs a result the offset process is outlawed as a fine art medium, a mystique has grown up\naround 'originality', and a reproduction is\nassumed to be, at best, a mediocre version of\nthe artist's original concept. And so it may be,\nfalsifying colour, tone and texture, but equally\nan original drawing or watercolour may be\nreproduced so faithfully (either manually or\nphotographically) that the facsimile could be\nmistaken for the original: by limiting the edition\nand signing the prints, the price of the\nreproduction sky-rockets from a few \u00a3s up into\ntwo or three figures.\nPrints Framed or Unframed\nThe above is neither Walkabout or Looksee,\nbut prompted by my excursion to 'The Roster\nShop' (168 Fulham Road, open six days a week) and 'Zella 9' (2 Park Walk, open seven\ndays a week until 9:00pm) on the same\nafternoon.\nZella 9 has, and I quote, 'the largest (and\nnicest) collection of limited edition prints in\nLondon'. Their prices are from \u00a34 (for postage-stamp-sized etchings) to around \u00a3100. Some\nare very fine: Tully Crook's 'Beyond the\nPlantations' silk screen is of tropical vegetation\nin disconcerting l yun tropical, swimming pool\ncolours which emphasise the dreamlike quality\nof the scene; Rosamund Jones' etching of a golden cockerel is a delicately traced flash of\nochre feathers. They also sell picture\npostcards (21p each) of Ronald Searle's manic-depressive and amorous cats\u2014offset-litho\nfrom ink, watercolour and pencil original.\nAt the Poster Shop the posters on sale are\nmostly advertising exhibitions held in\nEuropean or American art galleries. Prices\nstart around \u00a33 and rise well into two figures.\nThese prints are unsigned and do not qualify\nas 'originals'.\nDoes this reduce their artistic appeal? Is a Bresson photo on a poster advertising an\nexhibition of Bresson photos any less 'good'\nthan a signed copy on Kodak paper? And what\nif the poster is framed, rather than pasted on a hoarding?...like Zella 9, the Poster Shop offers\na framing service. The moral seems to be, buy\nwhat you enjoy\u2014if the kick of a signature or\nrarity value adds to the pleasure of ownership,\nbe prepared to pay for these.\nMeet Henry and Caroline\nAs you ponder, investigate what else this part\nof the Fulham Road has to offer.\nThe Pan Paperback Bookshop also sells\nPicadors and Penguins; its open until 10:00pm.

Deterrence is there when\nyou have retaliation, but if you've got a weapon that you could possibly fire first and\nuse to destroy your opponent's missiles,\nthat's not retaliation at all, that's getting in\nquick before your opponent does, and that's very unstable.\nJ MT: Aren't many missiles based on\nsubmarines, making them invulnerable to a first strike?\nNT: Actually this is not true as far as Eurostrategic weapons are concerned because\nvery few are in submarines, most are based\non land.\nPW: Eighty percent of Russian forces are in\nmissile silos.\nIn fact I'm not sure that in practice a first\nstrike is actually a reality, but it's certainly\nsomething that the Americans talk about\nand I think that any talk like that is very\ndangerous because it's going to frighten the\nhell out of your adversary. And there comes\na point when frightening your adversary is\ncounter-productive because they're so\nfrightened they fire off.\nNT: What you're saying is that the existance\nof these weapons deters the Russians, or the\nAmericans, from starting a small war in\nEurope. And that's true, given our present\nsituation which is that neither side wants to\nstart a war, because a conventional or a nuclear war would lead to a huge damage on\nboth sides. So that's one point, the reason\nthere hasn't been a war since the second\nworld war is that nobody wants one, because\nit would be a disaster, nuclear or otherwise.\nJMT: Well, surely that's deterrence, isn't it?\nNT: That is deterrence, yes. But when you\nconsider the specific role of the new nuclear\nweapons there is no way you can argue that\nthe Cruise missile and Trident are a deterrent in any sense more than what we\nhave now, because there is no point in\ndestroying people ten times over. And when\nit comes to destroying other people's missiles, that isn'ta deterrence either, that's just an incentive for them to send theirs off\nsooner. So we don't disagree with the notion\nof deterrence in military strategy, but the\npoint is that the sheer numbers of weapons is\nmaking a nonsense of deterrence.\nJMT: The reason for that surely is to have\nenough missiles so that enough would\nsurvive a first-strike by your opponent to\nenable you to retaliate.\nPW: That's one reason why the whole\nconcept of first strike is dangerous.\nNegotiations\nJMT: President Reagan has recently offered\nto meet Mr Andropov, and his negotiating\nposition for such a meeting is the 'zero\noption' to eliminate all land-based medium\nrange missiles in Europe. Do you see this as\na reasonable offer to the Russians?\nNT: Well, he's ignored a whole lot of\nweapons. He's ignored all the aircraft and\nsubmarine based weapons, and the British\nand French weapons. There are 400\nPoseidon missiles allocated to NATO for use\nin Europe in American submarines. So he's carefully ignored all those, so we have to say\nthe offer is unfair to the Russians because\nthey have relied much more on land based\nweapons.\nPW: What the offer essentially means is that\nthe Russians would have to get rid of every\nsingle SS20 and the Americans wouldn't deploy their proposed missiles, but they\nwould still retain a very strong force. In fact\nwhat they are suggesting to the Russians is\nthat they unilaterally disarm very, very\nheavily.\nNT: But having said that I personally feel\nthat it would have been something of a coup\nif the Russians had accepted the zero option,\nbecause my feeling is that the Americans saw\nit as a way of out mano eu ve ring the Russians\nin the public eye. I don't think it was ever\nintended as a serious disarmament initiative.\nJMT: When you're negotiating of course\nyou have to start from a position and\nhopefully work towards somewhere in the\nmiddle.\nNT: The worrying thing is that the\nAmericans don't seem to want to do that.\nThey haven't made any shift in their position\nat all from the zero option, whereas the\nRussians have at least made several offers.\nJMT: What do you feel that the Russians\nhave offered?\nPW: They've offered to reduce their\nweapons to the equivalent size of the\ncombined French and British weapons,\nwhich seems perfectly fair to me.\nJMT: Of course the British and French\naren't directly involved in the present\nnegotiations.\nPW: That's precisely what's wrong with\nthem, that's another reason why they're not\ngoing to work.\nPage 101\nJMT: So you're not optimistic that anything\ncould come out of the present negotiations?\nPW: Well it could, certainly. But as long as\nthe media regard it as a propaganda battle\nand as long as politicians go on the way they\ndo, just trying to score points off each other,\nthen I don't think the negotiations are going\nto get anywhere.\nConclusions\nSo what do I conclude from all this.\nPersonally 1 remain unconvinced that the\npeace-loving Soviet government is just\nwaiting for a conciliatory gesture from the\nWest and they will reduce their military\nbuild-up. I find the increasing tendency to\nsee Russia and the US as equally guilty for\nthe present impasse in negotiations\ndisturbing as well as being a distortion of the\ntruth. Let's not forget that in 1976\nJimmy Carter was elected pledged to reduce\nmilitary spending and to negotiate an end to\nthe arms race. The Soviet response was to\nincrease their levels of conventional and\nnuclear forces, and to invade Afghanistan.\nIn the end it was Carter who had to agree\nwith proposals from Europe to plan\ndeployment of new weapons, and to develop\nthe MX missile. Those who doubt the\ndetermination of President Reagan to\nachieve arms reductions cannot dismiss\nCarter's sincerity so easily. The fact is that\nthe Kremlin would regard a lack of\ndetermination by the West to deploy new\nweapons if necessary as a victory not for\nhuman survival and the good of mankind,\nbut as a victory for their negotiating and\npropaganda tactics enabling them to step\nahead in military strength. If there are\ndoubts in some peoples' minds about the\nsincerity of Ronald Reagan's commitment to\npeace, there can be no doubts about the lack\nof sincerity displayed by the Soviet\ngovernment. I cannot believe, much as I would like to, that they will agree to arms\nlimitations unless they are forced to.\nThe issues surrounding the disarmament\ndebate are both numerous and complex and\nI cannot cover all aspects in this article.\nHowever, I feel it is important to counter the\nde facto argument that because nuclear war\nwould be a tragedy of unprecedented scale\nas described in London After The Bomb we\nshould rid ourselves of nuclear weapons.\nThe idea that possession of weapons makes\nyou a more tempting target flies in the face\nof the lessons of history. Wars have started\nwhen one state believed it was sufficiently\nstrong to overpower another without risk of\ndefeat. The strong attack the weak every\ntime.\nThis is an extremely depressing topic,\ndespite being of the utmost importance.\nThere is no doubt that the proportion of the\nworld's wealth and resources being\nsquandered on military purposes is absurdly\nhigh, and it is a sad reflection of the type of\ngovernments ruling most of the world. It is\nhard to see a solution in the short term, but\nwhat is required is that the leaders of all the\nmajor world powers are responsive to the\nwishes of the majority of their people. I believe that we do have this responsiveness\nin the West, but there is little chance of\nseeing it in the Eastern bloc whilst\ntotalitarian governments hold power.\nmme am iau mmm sama mm FE "

    "content": "U5 AF* As defence hots up as an election issue Robert Kelseyputs the case\nfor unilateral nuclear disarmament.\nAS word or a Shield?\nFew people doubt these days\nthat the arms race is madness.\nMilitary expenditure is a waste\nof the earth's resources. Billions\nof pounds are spent each year on\nweapons of mass destruction\nwhich supposedly will never be\nused; millions of people are\ndying already from disease and\nstarvation. Individual nations\nare themselves for more security,\nbut overall the world becomes\nincreasingly unstable. The\nhuman race could be destroyed\nby a nuclear war; a nuclear war\ncould be started by accident; an\naccident is inevitable unless the\narms race is halted and re-versed.\nThe question these days is a matter of response to this\ncontinuing crisis. There are\nbasically three schools of\nthought: peace through strength,\nmultilateral disarmament and\nunilateral disarmament. The\nfirst two options are commonly\nlinked together; the second two\nare not necessarily mutually\nexclusive.\nPeace through strength is\nundoubtedly a silly policy. It is\nshort-sighted and insular,\nneglecting the long-term effects\nof an arms race and ignoring the\nthreat to global security. Although there has been peace in\nEurope\u2014plenty of wars else-where, but peace in Europe\u2014for\nthe past thirty-eight years, does\nthat mean this peace will\ncontinue for ever? If there is any\nchance of an accident occurring,\nthen given indefinite time it will\nhappen. With the arms race\ncontinuing, the nuclear balance\nbetween East and West grows\never more precarious, like two\npiles of single bricks growing\nmore unstable as they get higher.\nThe situation is already absurdly\nout of proportion, since both\nsides are in possession of\noverkill; it is worsened by\neconomic recession, aggressive\nposturing and talk of war-winning strategies.\nPage 6 H HM DH From Russia's point of view\nthe policy of peace through\nstrength must have the appearance of threatening behaviour.\nTaken with subversion by the\nCIA( principally in Latin\nAmerica), direct intervention\nsuch as that in Vietnam, and\nAmerican forward bases in\nEurope, the Russian threat\nbegins to look no worse than\nthat from America \u2014 it all\ndepends on where you stand.\nThe notion that we must arm\nourselves to negotiate from a 'position of strength' (that we\nmust arm ourselves to achieve\ndisarmament) is blatantly\ncontradictory. The policy of\npeace through strength is self-defeating anyway: increasing our\nweapons strength to neutral is e the Soviet threat will only result\nin the increase of that threat.\nThe Russians will not stand idly\nby while we attain superiority,\nand then allow us to dictate\nconditions for disarmament.\nThey will pursue the same\nstrategy, and numbers of nuclear\nweapons will rise to some new\nplateau from which the whole\nbusiness will start all over again,\nbut with increased risks. The\nproof of the pudding is in the\neating: multi late rial disarmament negotiations have been\ncontinuing, on and off, since\n1963 (The Partial Test Ban\nTreaty) with only limited success. The arms race has barely\nperceptibly slowed, neither\nstopped nor reversed.\nFar better would be to attempt to de-fuse the Russian\nthreat, by removing one of our\nbricks from the pile with no pre-conditions. Then we could see if\nthe Russians respond, by removing a brick from their own\npile. This process might continue\nat least until both piles are\nstable, it is a process of staggered\nmultilateral disarmament,\nalthough each step requires a unilateral initiative. Every time\nwe increase our weapons\nRobert Kelsey\nstrengths it is a unilateral\nescalation of the arms race, so\nwhy not a unilateral decrease?\nIn this context it should be\nnoted that CND's immediate\npolicy is for Britain unilaterally\nto abandon nuclear weapons (as\na first step towards a world free\nfrom weapons of mass de st ruc tion). There is no implied intention that the West or NATO as a whole should overnight disarm\nitself completely\u2014a common\nfallacy. That would be to remove\none pile of bricks entirely,\nwhereas CND'scone rn is to\nremove one brick as a unilateral\ninitiative. Another common\nfallacy is that of Britain's independent deterrent. We are\nnot an imperial power any more,\nhardly a major one even; it's about time we accepted this fact\nand ceased wasting our money\non Polaris and Trident. No way\ncould we use them without\nconsulting NATO. As for Cruise\nmissiles, they are controlled not\nby us but by America; the British\ngovernment has rejected suggestions of a dual-key approach.\nJapan has no nuclear wea-pons, and they have more reason\nthan any other country to\nprotect themselves from a nuclear attack. (Nuclear weapons are nuclear targets.)\nAustria and Finland have no\nnuclear weapons, despite being\nclosely adjacent to Russia\u2014they\nMay13,1983 MMM HH Hi obviously feel safer without\nthem. Canada, Norway and\nDenmark, although they are\nmembers of NATO, have not got\nany nuclear weapons.\nSwitzerland has no nuclear\nweapons, instead her defence is\ntruly defensive\u2014it provides no\nthreat, whether real or per-ce i ved. Deterrent defence, on the\nother hand, maintains peace by\nthreatening offence; it is more,\nlike a sword than a shield. A world in which everyone is\narmed with swords is overall\nmore dangerous than one in\nwhich some have swords and\nothers shields, or one in which\neveryone has shields. America,\nwith its handguns, is overall\nmore dangerous than Britain.\nThe logical extension of peace\nthrough strength is that every\ncountry in the world has nuclear\nweapons. Would there be no\nwars, and would we then be safe?\nA policy of unilateral nuclear\ndisarmament does not exclude\nthe possibility of multilateral\ndisarmament. Peace campaigners are frequently charged with\njeo pardi sing disarmament negotiations, and of making war\nmore likely. But surely the\nGeneva Talks on theatre nuclear.\nweapons, President Reagan's zero option, and President\nReagan's proposal of START\n(Strategic Arms Reduction\nTalks) have been prompted by\npublic opinion more than\nanything else, and public opinion has been prompted by peace\ngroups.\nWould unilateral disarmament by Britain make war more\nlikely? That is for individuals to\ndecide according to their con-science. In the words of Bertrand\nRussell 'Remember your humanity and forget the rest'.\nw mmm mmm mmm FE "

    "content": "CND Issue\nPeople have already started\nquestioning my political bias in\npublishing a CND feature this\nweek so perhaps a few words of\nexplanation will not come amiss.\nAlthough I am sympathetic to\nthe ideals of the CND movement\nI believe it would be an abuse of\nmy position to use FELIX as a means of promoting these\nbeliefs. However I do feel that\npeople's thinking about nuclear\narms needs to be regularly\nstimulated (whatever their\nfeelings) and when several\npeople asked me independently\nif I would include an article in\nFELIX covering some aspects of\nthe nuclear debate, it seemed\nlogical to include them all\ntogether in one issue. Inevitably,\na large amount of the material\nhas been written by members of\nC ND, and in particular by\nRobert Kelsey. I make no\napology for this; it is simply an\nextension of the usual 'Opinion'\ncolumn which frequently appears in FELIX. One thing which\nEDITORIAL\nI should perhaps apologise for is\nthe way I referred to this as a 'CND issue' in last week's editorial, thus misleading some\npeople into thinking it would be\nused as a vehicle for my own\npropaganda.\nNaturally Consoc and other\ninterested bodies will be allowed\nthe right of reply; indeed their\nchairman John Pattison has\nalready arranged for FELIX to\ninterview Lady Olga Maitland.\nFinally, to J Martin Taylor\nwho not only interviewed Philip\nWebber and Neil Turok, but\nalso coordinated all the CND\npages and supervised the laying\nout and pasting up, I offer my\nthanks for the huge amount of\nhard work it involved.\nFlashing\nOne of the more disturbing\naspects of the flasher in the\nUnion gym was his method of\nentry.

This week, I shall give a taste (in more senses than one)\nof one of the most entertaining\npress releases ever to reach my\ndesk.\nIt came from a Mr Cecil\nGysin who, the heading tells me,\nforms half of the directorship of\nGysin and Hanson Ltd, the\nFELIX HH B^ f^ilM H Hi SBELOW\nx \u00a3*_iT C, ICCCCOIO~0~l\"|~'~,~|~,\"|~l~ l~l~ l~r\"t~ l~l~ l~l~ l~l~ l~l~[~ l~l~ l\"*l\"' l~l~ l~l~ l~i iii ri iiii ii~i ri~i \u2014\niii iji r_ ii it i ill ll ll il\"l llI lil ll llI lil ll Ill ll Ill j~ i~i~i~i~ ri~i~i~i~ i~t~ i~)~t~ i~i~i~ i~t| i_i_i_i_ i~i~i~i~ i~i~i~ iii iii~ i~i~i~ i~t~ i\"iii iiii iii iii it iiii it ir' other half, surprisingly, not\nbeing Mr Hanson but one HZ DTM E Esterhavzy.\nGysin and Hanson Ltd are\nproducers of natural sausage\nskins, and the press release goes\nto extraordinary lengths to\nconvince me of the superiority of\n'natural' skins, which are made\nfrom intestines, over 'reprocessed' skins, made from the\ninner membrane of the hide of\nthe animal.\nTHE SAUSAGEAND ITS SKIN\nA guide to one of the world's most popular foods The accompanying literature\nis produced by the Natural\nSausage Casings Association,\nwhich must surely qualify as the\nworld's most obscure pressure\ngroup. The sausage, it points\nout, is the world's oldest\nconvenience food and the\nbrochure goes on to explain\nin detail some rather more than I wanted to know about sausages,\nincluding its history, hints on\ncooking it, recipes using it, and\n(most importantly) how to tell\nwhether the skin on your\nsausage is naturally salt-covered\nor whether it is the inferior and\nignoble reprocessed collagen\nvariety.\nIn case any of my readers are\nas ill-informed as I was, and are\npuzzled and concerned over the\nintricacies of the humble sausage\nand the i rr ever sable physical and\nmental damage which may be\nproduced by continued consumption of reprocessed sausage\ncasings, let me as a public service\noutline just a little of what I have\nlearnt.\nThe first literary mention of\nthe sausage is Homer's Odyssey,\nwhich was written in 850BC, although, the brochure says, sausages were recorded'in Asia Minor\nin 6000BC( presumably in a prehistoric sausage recording\nstudio, another first for radio\nover print). We are then led to\nconsider whether Roman orgies\nwere so popular because sausages were eaten there, and\nponder the fact that Constantine\nmade sausage-eating illegal\nwhen he embraced Christianity.\nThe best sausages, we are told,\nare to be seen in butchers' shops,\nI May13,19831 where they can be seen hanging\nin luscious curves which tell you\nthey are in natural skins. Natural\nskins will not burst during\ncooking, are juicy and provide\nadditional protein, allow the\nsausages to be neatly linked\nwithout leaving unsightly folds\nat the ends, and give the sausage\nits attractive curve and an\napp et ising bloom.\nSausages should be fried tin\nmedium heat for 5-7 minutes on\neach side. NEVER PRICK\nYOUR SAUSAGES.\nBut enough of the mouthwatering brochure with its\ntasteful logo, and back to Mr\nGysin's press release which\nopens with the searching quest-t ions 'Why is there such a steady\nincrease in home sausage mak-ing? Could it be the consumer's objection to man-made collagen\ncasings so prevalent in super-markets' products?' and goes on\nto announce their pride that they\ncan now supply by mail order:\n25 yards of natural hog\ncasing\u2014en cough to make 201b of sausage\u2014plus a recipe leaflet\n(with instructions) and a pack of\nready-mixed herbs and spices. It\ncomes packed in are seal able tub\nand will keep for 6 months in a cool larder. \u00a33 includes postage\nand packing, and there is no\nVAT to pay.

Ghent\nprovides early season experience\nof racing high quality opposition\nover a2,000m multi lane course.\nThe journey over to Belgium\nwas on a 'luxury' coach arranged\nwith London RC. After a guided\ntour of most of Northern Europe\nwe arrived in Ghent at 6:00pm to\nfind that the boats had already\nsafely (?) arrived. Following a short practise on the course,\nwe went off to find the accommodation provided by the\norganisers. It turned out to be a Nazi prisoner of war camp run\nby Adolf Hitler's son hastily\ndisguised as a Belgian Youth\nHostel.\nOn the Saturday, the first\neight entered the open eights\nevent and the remainder of the\nsquad entered cox less fours. In\nthe heat of the eights, the\npolished Cambridge University\ncrew got off the start very\nquickly together with Dutch\nclub, Nereus leaving IC in third\nplace just ahead of the British\nlightweight eight. With a storm-er of a row, the IC crew pulled\nback to come second to Cambridge by one length, beating\nNercus by V4 length and the\nlightweights by l'/4 lengths. In\nthe final IC were the slowest\nqualifiers, but even so rowed a disappointing race coming fifth\nwith Cambridge winning.\nThe cox less4 produced an\nexcellent row in the heat in\nwinning by literally a couple of\nin chek s from a four from the\nBritish lightweight squad. Their\ntime was the fastest of the\nqualifiers. The two UL crews\nwere well beaten with times 5\nand 13 seconds behind IC.\nIn the final the College four\nhad another good one coming\nthird behind a British heavyweight four all of whom had\nwon silver medals in Moscow,\nbut had not been pushed in the\nheat.\nOn the Sunday the main\nsuccess was the under-23 cox ed four taken from the 1st VIII.\nThey rowed their heat at 7:30am despite three man Andrew\nSpalding being decidedly ill, and\nqualified. In the final, following\na slow start, the IC crew pulled\nthrough the massive German\nfour, who were last year's world\njunior champions, to come\nsecond winning the second\nmedal\nThe under-23 eight had a bad\nrow coming fourth in the final.\nThe cox less four again entered\nthe open event and having had a bad row in the heat, only\nqualified for the final when a German crew dropped out.\nLying in third place with 500m to go, the IC crew was ready for\nthe final push when the UL crew,\nV4 length down, spurted and\ndeliberately steered into IC,\nrobbing them of a medal. It is a sign of the poor quality of the\nUL crew when they have to\ndeliberately crash to prevent a College crew from beating them.\nMeanwhile, back in England,\nthe remainder of the boat club\nwas racing on the Thames in\nLondon. On Saturday at Mortlake regatta, the senior B eight\nfailed to produce the form of\nwhich they are capable, losing in\nthe final. The ladies novice 8\nreceived no reward for enthusiastic training, losing to Westminister Hospital in the final.\nOn the Sunday, at Vesta\nDaskes, the Senior B eight broke\ninto two fours. The cox less four\nhad difficulties with the rudder\nand lost by a canvas. The cox ed four managed to win their event\ndespite having to re row the final\nagainst Exeter University after a dead heat.\nAll in all a successful weekend\nfor the Boa. Club. Dickhead of\nthe Belgian Tour award goes to\nPeter McConnell who not only\nsteered the cox less four over\nevery lane of the course, but also\nforgot his n is sport! c key IC vs Presidents XI 7-2\nThe game always promised to be\nhigh scoring with both sides\npushing forward. However with\nthe First XIs defence being\nrather better organised and\nmarking tighter it came as no\nsurprise when they raced to a three nil lead with a shot (at\nlast) from Ayers and goals from\nParker (after a lot of effort) and\nRealff.\nAt this point the Presidents\nCaptain Webb stole a rather\nlucky goal from a def el c tion within the firsts defence. Halftime refreshments (champagne?)\nwere supplied by birthday boy\nEldridge, who obviously intended to spur the l sts onto\ngreater things.\nThe second half was just as\nexciting with the firsts pushing\nforward and only being prevented from scoring by a number of saves by Butler however\nthe l sts forward line's efforts\nwere rewarded by further goals\nby Ayers (2), Bell and birthday\nboy himself (on his second\nattempt). This left the firsts in\njubilant mood, if not rather\nslack in defence, and with\nStroomer, Gray and Clift it was\nhardly surprising that they can\nget everyone in defence flat\nfooted and Clift scored a well\ndeserved goal.\nUmpires: D Hardwick, A Whitehead.\n1st Team: Jones, Riley, Cunningham, Parker, Eldrige, Ayers,\nFranklin, Realff, Bell, Garmes,\nDubenski.\nPresidents: Butler, Clift,\nStewart, Coatesworth, Murrey,\nWebb, Stroomer, Gray, Wigney,\nmod ley. PS: Many thanks to Dr and\nMrs Hardwick for the wonderful\nmeal after the game.\nTonight's the night we see the\nHarlem Globetrotters at Wembley; meet at the Sportscentre at\n5:30pm for the tube. Apologies\nto those who were unable to get\ntickets.\nLast week's issue of FELIX\nshould have contained a mammoth Squash Club tour report,\nwhich is probably why it wasn't printed. Never mind. The club\nofficers are instead currently\ndeciding whether to start their\nown 'Spot the Ball' competition,\nrun along similar lines to those\nin the popular press, to be\njudged by the eminently qualified Simon Roberts.

    "content": "Last year a group from IC published a book on the effects of nuclear\nweapons. In this article J Martin Taylor writes about the book and\ninterviews two of its authors.\nBombs Away!\n'Do you believe you could survive a nuclear\nwar? If you do, you will find the facts\ncontained in this book extremely disturbing.'\nThe book London After the Bomb, written\nmainly by a group from our own Physics\ndepartment, is a concise and readable\naccount of what the authors predict would\nbe the effect of a nuclear attack on London.\nIt is a well researched and thought out\nprediction too, and the conclusions that they\nreach are as bad as one might expect they\nwould be. If anyone is still in the dark about\nthis and imagines that nuclear weapons are\nactually quite cuddly then I would strongly\nrecommend this book to them.\nThe authors have in the main attempted\nto present facts rather than make points in\nthe disarmament debate, although as they\nconcede they 'have not attempted the rather\nartificial exercise of concealing our views\naltogether.' In particular they seem to\nexaggerate for effect the risks of an\n'accidental' nuclear war, and in a section\nlabelled 'The Breakdown of 'Deterrence\"\ntucked away at the back of the chapter on\nCivil Defence they are also guilty of some\nmisrepresentation in saying that the\ndeterrence policy requires that 'we must\nlearn to live with their (the nuclear\nweapons') eventual use'. But I suppose they\ncan be allowed a few excesses, after all it\nmakes the book seem more relevant if you\n\u2022believe that the balloon might go up\nanytime.\nIn addition to the chapters on the effects\nof a nuclear weapon, the likely pattern of an\nattack, and the immediate and long term\neffects, they point out the severe inadequacies of the Home Office's Civil Defence\nplans and 'Protect and Survive' particularly.\nIt surprises me that they ever expected to\nfind that civil defence was a realistic\nproposition, if indeed they ever did. They\ncorrectly conclude that 'there can be no\neffective civil defence against an all-out\nnuclear attack'.\nAfter reading the book I was able to\ninterview two of its authors, who are both\nstill at Imperial College: Dr Philip Webber\nand Neil Turok. What follows is a summary of the discussion in which I tried\nto find out how their views on disarmament\nrelate to the findings of the book, and then I finish with some of my own conclusions on\nthe disarmament debate. Please note that the\ninterview was conducted in March and there\nhave been some new moves in the Geneva\nnegotiations since then.\nJMT: What prompted you to, write the book\nin the first place?\nPW: We wanted to know what would\nhappen if there was a nuclear attack, and\nthere didn't seem to be much information\navailable about it. We never intended to\nPage 8 H MBH H BH HH BE HB MH Hi write a book; we intended to write\nsomething like a four page pamphlet, but the\nmore we researched into it, the more we\nfound discrepancies with what the Home\nOffice said, and there was so much material\nthat it became very long. Then the\npublishers became interested and approached us about it.\nJMT: And has it sold well?\nPW: It's sold very well; over 25,000 copies.\nJMT: You say in the introduction that in the\nbook you tried to present the facts rather\nthan your political views, and I would agree\nthat there is very little in the book which\nisn't factual. Could you briefly outline your\nviews on the issue of nuclear arms?\nPW: I don't think we realised until we wrote\nthe book the sheer scale of the numbers of\nweapons and more particularly the new\ndevelopments in the types of weapons and\nwhat they are capable of. Once we did\nrealise, we felt that the risk of nuclear war\nbreaking out was higher than ever before\nand that should things continue as they are\ndoing at the moment then there is no way we\naren't eventually going to have a nuclear\nwar. It's a real arms race, and no arms race\nhas ever finished without a war in history\nbefore, and there's no reason to suppose this\none will; we can't see any way out of it other\nthan a de-escalation of the numbers of\nnuclear weapons.\nNT: But all five authors have our own\npolitical views, and we've tried in the book\nto avoid putting them before the facts.\nPW: I think it's important for people to\nmake their own decisions based on accurate\ninformation, but the point is that they're not\ngiven accurate information by the Government.\nJMT: So could your views on nuclear\nweapons be described as unilateral is t? NT & PW: No, no not at all.\nNT: To a certain extent I think that the\nnuclear issue is not a political one and our\nmotivation in writing the book was not to\nmake it into one. We think it's an issue of\nsuch importance that everybody ought to be\nconcerned about it regardless of their\npolitical affiliations. Obviously some of the\npolitical parties seem to be more interested\nin getting rid of nuclear weapons, like the\nLabour Party who have a unilateral is t policy.\nJMT: But your personal views you wouldn't describe as unilateral is t? PW: I don't just want unilateral is m,I want\nto reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons\nby whatever process.\nNT: I don't think unilateral is m is a useful\nword actually.\nJMT: To be more specific, do you feel that\nthis country should not have any nuclear\nweapons?\nNT: Firstly, there is no doubt that Cruise\nmissiles and Trident are a large escalation in\nthe number of nuclear weapons owned by or\nstationed in Britain and I regard them as a major threat to peace in Europe, so Cruise\nand Trident in particular I am very strongly\nagainst.\nJMT: You focus on these two types of\nmissile as being a new threat to peace?\nPW: Take the case of Trident, for example.\nOne Trident submarine is more powerful\nthan the entire Polaris fleet now, so that's a massive escalation, and Cruise missiles are a potential first-strike weapon, although the\npresent government deny that they are.\nJMT: But Cruise missiles take a long time to\nreach their target, don't they?\n\u00ab Ar*If H,:i Neil Turok (left) and Philip Webber: 'A cut in the West's numbers of weapons.....would be a very good reason for the Russians to follow suit.'\nPW: But if you can't see it coming It is\ncertainly stealthy enough to be a possible\nfirst strike weapon aimed at a missile silo,\nwhich is very disturbing.\nWe don't just see it as an arms race in\nquantity, the point is there is a change in the\nquality which is des tabi lising. The numbers\nhave gone way beyond deterrence, I don't think that this level of weapons is a deterrent\nat all, I think it's des tabi lising and likely to\nbring us to a nuclear war starting by\naccident or even to force the USSR into such\na corner that they feel they have to fight.\nJMT: So you feel that we should be\nextremely cautious about improving our\narmories, not to be seen to be building up,\nalthough you aren't in favour of scrapping\nall our nuclear weapons at the moment?\nNT: The priority at the moment is not to\nhave any more weapons. Once that is\nachieved, and I think everybody should be\nconcerned to achieve that, then we can talk\nabout scrapping Polaris. But that's a secondary issue at the moment.\nJMT: But do you feel that both sides have to\nbe involved, that you have to take the\nbalance of arms into account?\nPW: One thing I would advocate is\nmultilateral disarmament by unilateral\nstages.\nNT: That's the only way multilateral\ndisarmament ever comes about.\nPW: Negotiation is not going to work.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 i^^HI HH HB BIi^ H May JMT: So you feel that if this country or\nanother in the West were to reduce their\narms by a certain level that this could be\nfollowed by the Easterion bloc?\nNT: Yes, or vice-versa. The Russians have\njust offered to reduce the numbers of their\nnuclear weapons and I think we in turn\nshould offer to reduce ours.\nPW: It's appalling the way the government\nhas reacted to the Russian offer. I'm not\nsaying that they should accept it, but they've\njust dismissed it as being totally un imp or tant.\nJMT: Do you think that the Russian\ngovernment has the same pressure on them\nto negotiate as the West? In the West there is\npublic opinion pressuring President Reagan\nand Mrs Thatcher and, since politicians\nalways like to be popular, there must be a strong incentive for them to try to reduce the\nlevels of arms which would be a popular\nachievement.\nPW: I think there's intense pressure of the\nRussians from within because of internal\nproblems they have with the other Warsaw\nPact members and their large non-Russian\ncommunities, and they have severe\neconomic problems. All these things make\nthem not want to spend so much on arms.\nBut what I think really motivates the arms\nrace is basic fear, fear of the Russians and\nthe Russians' fear of us.\nJMT: What would you see as being a good\n13,19831~\nway, if any, to break through this fear and\ndistrust?\nPW: By communication, and I think a very\nstrong form of communication the West\ncould make about their intentions would be\na cut in their numbers of weapons which was\nclearly announced and performed and seen\nto have been done. I think that would be a very good reason for the Russians to follow\nsuit.\nCivil Defence\nJMT: In the book you take a lot of space\nattack i qg the government's civil defence\nplans and the pamphlet 'Protect and\nSurvive'.\nPW: We don't attack them actually\nJMT: You point out how inadequate the\nplans are.\nPW: I think it's worth pointing out that we\ndidn't set out to criticise what they said at\nall. We were shocked by the level of\ninadequacy of the Home Office advice, and\nin fact we found it very misleading in some\ncases, particularly when you consider that\ntheir private internal documents present a totally different picture to their public ones.\nJMT: What advice do you think the\ngovernment could usefully give and what\npreparations do you think they should make\nfor a nuclear war, given that all such\neventualities have to be planned for by the\ngovernment.\nPW: Well, they could start by telling the\ntruth.\nNT: It is very important to let people know\nhow bad nuclear war is, because only if\npeople do know that, and realise how much\nmoney is being spent on nuclear weapons,\ndo they start to take an interest in what's happening. But more than providing\n'information on what nuclear weapons can\ndo, it becomes a question of whether the\ngovernment should be encouraging people\nto build deep shelters. To us it seems a pre t'y irrelevant question at the moment because\nvery few people can afford one. And I don't think the government could justify spending\na large amount of public money on shelters\nbecause it's just not practicable; people\nwould face such serious problems in the long\nterm anyway after a nuclear attack. The only\nviable option at the moment is to try and\navoid a nuclear attack; it's not really a serious option to try and survive one.\nJMT: Do you not feel that what the Home\nOffice is trying to do is to provide\nreassurance, because they wouldn't want a general panic if a war seemed likely? Of\ncourse the Home Office must know that the\nmeasures suggested in 'Protect and Survive'\nare inadequate.\nPW: The danger with that point of view is\nthat as long as you don't know the truth you\ncannot make decisions about your future\nwhich are valid. If you are going to be\ndestroyed in a nuclear war in ten years' time\nis the government being helpful by not\ntelling you; because the point is if you know\nthere could be a nuclear war in ten years'\ntime you could do something about it and\nstop it. If we felt people couldn't do\nanything to stop it happening then obviously\nwe wouldn't be saying what we are saying, it\nwould be an absolute waste of time and it\nwould be totally irresponsible. But people\ndo have the power to change things so that\nwe can have a society where we are not living\nunder the threat of a nuclear war. That's what we're really talking about, and we're\ntalking about that globally, because it won't work in isolation.\nJ. Martin Taylor: 'Unconvinced'\nJMT: I imagine a lot of the government's thinking must be that obviously they can't have everyone running around the country\ntrying to escape; that in itself would create\ngreat problems for survival.\nPW: That is actually one of the main reasons\nfor civil defence, because in fact strangely\nenough here we are supposedly defending\nour freedom with nuclear weapons and the\nvery preparations for nuclear war are the\ncomplete removal of such freedoms. You\nwould have the rounding up of likely\nsubversives and there is no definition of\nwhat a subversive is. It's probably somebody\nlike us for all we know.\nJMT: So you don't feel that there is much\nthe government can do about Civil Defence\nother than setting out the facts?\nPW: As long as they continue to lie and say\nthat most of the population could survive a nuclear attack they are just misleading\npeople and encouraging them to put their\nheads in the sand. As far as we can see with\nthe number of nuclear weapons we've got,\nthe civil defence of this country is a nonsense.\nDeterrence\nJMT: Perhaps the only part of the book\nwhich I didn't find entirely factual was in\nchapter six where you talk about the\nbreakdown of deterrence. Given that\ndeterrence is designed to prevent a war\ntaking place, how do you justify saying that\nit has failed?\nPW: Well, it hasn't failed yet.\nJMT: When you say it's broken down you\nmean that in some way it's no longer\nworking as it should do?\nNT: It's no longer a reason why a war hasn't started, it's no longer preventing a war. In\nfact at the moment the principal danger of\nworld war is the fact that these weapons\nexist, because that leads to the hostility there\nis between East and West.\nPW: Take the Pershing II missile which can\nget to Moscow in five or six minutes, once\nthat's deployed Russia has to go for a launch-on-warning response, there's no\nother way they could possibly reply to that\n(continued on next page)\nIPage9\n\n"

Between\nMonday 19 and Friday 25\nMarch about half-a dozen\nmembers of IC CND canvassed\nCollege Halls of Residence,\nnamely Holbein, Garden, Falmouth Keogh and Linstead.\nThis involved knocking on\npeople's doors, and asking five\nquestions. (Not everyone was in,\nand we couldn't do every Hall\nbecause our numbers were\nlimited.) The Wardens of Weeks\nand Selkirk-Tizard Halls denied\nus permission to knock on\ndoors, so instead we handed out\nleaflets in the form of question-n aires. Only nine of these were\nreturned, but they roughly\nparalleled the overall results (as\ndid each of the houses in divi du ally).\nThe aims of the canvass are at\nleast twofold: to count existing\nopinions on major issues of\nnuclear defence, and to ensure\nthat people are aware of these\nissues. We spent a lot of time\nQuestion Response\nNo Yes Undecided Do not\nor don't wish to\n\u2022 know answer\n1.

Question five is now of\ncourse highly relevant!\nAn /// Wind\nWhen the Wind Blows by Raymond\nBriggs, directed by David Neilson,\nWhitehall Theatre.\nWhen the Wind Blows is a play about civil\ndefence during a nuclear attack. Set in a country cottage in the southeast of England,\nHilda and Jim (played by Patricia Routledge\nand Ken Jones) are a retired working class\ncouple. It is a time of very grave international\ntension \u2014 a crisis is imminent\u2014and Jim\ndecides to build a shelter in their living room\naccording to the official governmental Protect\nand Survive. Moments later, they hear a pre-pack broadcast on the radio\u2014enemy missiles\nwill strike in three minutes. In they go into their\nshelter, a nuclear bomb detonates some way\noff, their house is very nearly reduced to\nrubble, but they survive. An intense quietness\nand loneliness sets in. There is no water or\nelectricity. A day or two later they feel sick,\nthey pass blood, hair starts falling out and\nenormous spots grow about their knees.\nThe play is a black comedy about the futility of\ncivil defence for the purposes of surviving a nuclear attack. The two characters are easily\ndefined. The wife doesn't want to think about a thing like war\u2014it has got nothing to do with her\ndaily work and its problems\u2014it will never\nhappen. She is ignorant of the facts. But the\nhusband does know; he has his wits about him,\nbut submits to authority. They know best, he\nfeels. Needless to say, there are many such\ncharacters in this country. Ignorance,\npassivity and blind obedience to authority are\nrife.\nHowever the play is extraordinarily\nunpretentious, low-key and dare I say it, even\nsimple. I honestly think the arguments about\nnuclear defence and nuclear warfare have\ncome a long way since the realisation of the\nhopeless inadequacy of second world war\nFELIX^ H HIM I defence methods in the face of spectacularly\nsophisticated and destructive weaponry. I think, and I hope, the public has moved on\nfrom discussing those points raised in the play.\nThe Whitehall production is unquestionably\na piece of political theatre. The company and\nits backers have obviously not put on the show\nas a form of light relief after a hard day's work.\nThe intention of course is to get people to\nappreciate the futility\u2014the dangerous futility\u2014\nof the government's war preparations. But the\nonly people who would be changed by seeing\nthe play would be people like Jim and Hilda in\nthe play\u2014people ignorant of the facts, people\nindifferent to the situation, people who say\n'yes' to authority, people who think the next\nworld war or a nuclear war will be like the last,\nand people who haven't realised that each\nnuclear bomb is now ten times as destructive\nas the Hii-^shima one. There are plenty of\nthese people about but one has to ask whether\na theatre in arguably the smartest street in the\ncountry is the place to reach them. A cursory\nglance around the audience suggests not.\nIt is for this reasons that I cannot really\nrecommend the play to anyone at IC\u2014anyone\nthat is who has taken the trouble to examine\nthe debate in a rational and intelligent way.\nHowever the play does have its odd flashes of\ncleverness and insight, as when Jim says of the\nRussians 'democratic principles will be instilled\nin them whether they like it or not' and when\nHilda often says 'Oh I'm sorry, I keep\nforgetting. That was last time.' (ie the last war).\nThe play is quite good at showing the nostalgia\npeople have for a previous war\u2014the\ncomradeship, the unity of purpose, and the\nother 'advantages' of a war (a taboo subject).\nSome pretty frightening electronic sounds,'are\nused in the play to simulate nuclear sirens Snd\nwhen 'the bomb' goes off an extremely loud\nand long rumbling sound is relayed that\nliterally shakes the audience and the theatre.\nIt is a pity When the Wind Blows is so' low-key. The whole debate about war and its\nethical and political consequences is discussed\nin far more involved and provocative ways\nelsewhere (such as at the National Theatre).\nThe Whitehall production is a contribution to\nthe debate, but, I fear, a minor one.\nNick Bedding\nDon't expect me to try to tell\npeople how to vote: vote according to your consciences on the\nmajor issues. I think nuclear\ndisarmament is the most important issue of all, for this country\nand the future of all humanity.\nRobert Kelsey.\nCiv Eng 5,\nKen Jones and Patricia Routlege in 'When the Wind Blows'\nIPag*\u00bb7\n\n"
