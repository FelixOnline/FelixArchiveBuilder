Arts Editor, Claire, reviews this sweet pop-up just in time for summer!\nFOOD\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nA\ns term ends\n(at last!) and\nsummer makes\nits approach,\nwe can all take a well-de-served break from the\ndaily grind of revision and\nexams. Holidays abroad,\nlazing around in the sun,\nicecreaminthepark-what\ncould be better? On your\nlist of indolent summer\nindulgence should definitely be Whisk Dessert\nBar, a pop-up restaurant\nin Angel which serves\nup a three-course meal\nconsisting only of des-serts. That\u2019s right, dessert\nfor the appetiser, dessert\nfor the main course, and\ndessert for\u2026 dessert.

Their\nnew location in Angel is\nspacious and very chic \u2013\ndark wood and mirrors,\nblack-and-white tiles and\nleather seats. It gives off\nthe air of an elegant diner.\nWith Nat King Cole and\nsensual jazz playing while\nyou eat, it\u2019s an excellent\nplace for a date.

Simon Jenkins, the\nmain man in the kitchen, is\nan award-winning pastry\nchef most recently named\nthe Craft Guild of Chefs\u2019\nPastry Chef of the Year\nin 2018. The three-course\nmenu he has created is\nfull of innovative flavour\npairings and intriguing\ntwists on old classics.\nYou get a fixed starter and\ndessert, but get to pick\nfrom one of six desserts\nfor your main course.\nFor a little extra, you can\nsample one of the teas or\ndessert wines specially\npicked to complement\neach main course.\nThings got off to an\nexciting start with the\namuse-bouche, which was\nstrawberry jelly, vanilla\nyoghurt mousse and lime\nfoam. The lime foam dissolved into nothingness on\nthe tongue, leaving just a\nhint of lime to accompany\nthe strawberry and vanilla\nmousse.\nParsnip ice cream and\nhorseradish zest? Not\nsomething I\u2019d ever think\nof putting in dessert, but\nthere it is on the menu as\npart of an orange-choc-olate confection. Something to try the next time\nI\u2019m back! I had a beautifully light vanilla parfait\nwith fresh berries, aged\nbalsamic vinegar and basil\n(though it could have used\na little more basil flavour),\nwhile my dining companion had a very yummy\ndeconstructed rhubarb\ncrumble.

I\nvery nearly went for the\nblue cheese myself, but\nwas prevented from doing\nso by my long-standing\nhatred of celery. Fortunately, Randon brought\nout one of the new dish-es-in-testing for us to have\na sneak preview.

Being the hypefest that E3 is,\nnot everything lives up to the standard set by fans that\nis not being a blatant cash grab!\nGAMES\nConnor winzar\nGames Editor\nE\n3 has always\nbeen Christmas\nfor gamers, with\nplenty of good\nreleases that fill you with\nsurprise and wonder, as\nwell as a fair handful of\nbad releases, the ones that\nmake you question how\nthe marketing directors\nkeep their jobs. Now, I\ncan imagine most people\nhave heard about some\nof the better releases like\nCyberpunk 2079, Doom\nEternal and Watch Dogs\nLegion, and that\u2019s why\nI wanted to focus on the\nless thrilling events that\ntranspired during E3, so\nlet\u2019s get right into it.\nStepping up to the plate\nfirst is the announcement\nof more human NPCs\nand a battle royale mode\nin Fallout 76, which was\nsomehow met with a great\ndeal of applause. Let me\nelaborate, when your\naudience is applauding\nyou for having more\nhuman NPCs in a game,\nit speaks volumes about\nthe already poor quality\nof your game, especially\ngiven the past controversy\nthat has followed Fallout\n76. So, to suddenly hear\nthe applause for such\na simple addition to an\nalready very broken\ngame is saddening to say\nthe least. What would\nhave been better is an\nannouncement that they\nwere going to actually\nmake the game playable,\nas opposed to adding a\nbattle royale mode and a\nfew human NPCs. All-inall, it\u2019s a depressing feat\nin itself.\nNow I like to consider\nmyself a man of finer\nthings, those finer things\nbeing binge watching\nAlways Sunny In Philadelphia and learning bird\nlaw. However, I was by\nno means anticipating\nRob McElhenney (Mac)\ncoming onto the stage\nin all his muscle-bound\nglory and revealing a new\nshow during the Ubisoft\nconference. Despite possessing the same charm\nand charisma as his acting\nrole, it seems that gaming\nfans were not thrilled\nby the announcement\ndue to it being a show as\nopposed to a game. The\nshow itself is focused\naround the life of game\ndevelopers and features\nthe likes of Community\u2019s\nDanny Pudi and Always\nSunny In Philadelphia\u2019s\nDavid Hornsby. The\nresponse from gaming\nfans is expected given\nE3\u2019s predominant focus\non gaming as opposed to\nany other media, regardless of if they relate to a\ngame. Regrettably, Rob\u2019s\ncharm couldn\u2019t win the\nfans over.\nAnd with that unfortunate tale told, I shift\nmy cynicism towards the\nblatant cash grabs of E3.\nNow by cash grabs\nI\u2019m not referring to the\nclassic triple A titles with\nhorrific micro-transac-tions - looking at you\nEA. Thankfully, this E3\ndodged that matter only to\nswerve into the oncoming\ntruck that is mobile game\nreleases, which are notorious for their micro-trans-actions and supposedly\n\u2018free\u2019 price tag. Just like\nthe degradation of the\nCommand and Conquer\nseries to a mobile game,\nanother IP received the\nsame treatment, Commander Keen, originally\na classic on the MS-DOS\nin 1990, the once sacred\nchildhood memories have\nnow been desecrated with\nits return as a mobile\ngame. Now I understand\nthat a mobile game on\nits own is perfectly fine,\nhowever, more than likely\nmicro-transactions will\nNuclear Winter, I hope it\u2019s warmer than the cold shoulder given to their fans// Bethesda\n\u201cWhen your\naudience is\napplauding\nyou for\nhaving more\nhuman NPCs\nin a game,\nit speaks\nvolumes about\nits already\npoor quality\u201d\nbe applied to this game\nin another blatant cash\ngrab. So for those who\nwere gaming back when\nit was initially released,\nget ready to play it again\nwith none of the original\nvintage pleasantries and\nall of the cash grabbing\nmechanics that come with\nthe modern age; fingers\ncrossed that it doesn\u2019t turn\ninto a raging dumpster\nfire.\nSpeaking of blatant\ncash grabs, another mobile\ngame to unpleasantly\nsurprise fans is the very\nmuch undesired pop vinyl\nmobile game featuring\n\u201cE3 Dodged\ntriple A micro-transactions\nonly to swerve\ninto the\noncoming\ntruck that is\nmobile game\nreleases\u201d\nGame aesthetics that only a developer could love // Wikimedia\nISSUE 1726\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nE3, now get ready to read about the downright awful!\nGears of War. Honestly,\nI don\u2019t know what was\ngoing through their minds\nwhen they made this but\nit was most likely dollar\nsigns at this point, but\nat least they announced\nanother Gears game rather\nthan what they did to Sam\nFisher (from the Splinter\nCell franchise). What\nhappened to Sam Fisher,\nyou ask? Well I want you\nto imagine this - you\u2019re a\nhardcore Splinter Cell fan\nand have been waiting for\nanother addition to the\nseries since its last release\nin 2013, suddenly a news\nnotification appears on\nyour phone with the text\n\u201cSplinter Cell\u2019s Sam\nFisher returns\u2026\u201d your\neyes lighten up only to\nrealise that he\u2019s now an\nadd-on character in a new\nTom Clancy mobile game.\nSo, long story short,\nfans were, as you would\nimagine, very disappointed with the news as their\nWetwork hero returned\nonly in mobile game\nform instead of an actual\ntriple A title; something\nwhich developers thought\nadequate to boast at E3\nas opposed to announce\nit any other point in the\nyear where the spotlight\nwouldn\u2019t be as near as\nbright, nor focused.\nDevelopers of\nShenmue 3 should have\ntaken that advice when\nthey abruptly announced\nto their Kickstart funders\nthat they were now\nbeing funded by Sony\nand that the game was\nalso going to be an epic\nstore exclusive. Refusing\nto offer refunds to said\nKickstart funders, they\nclaimed that their money\nwas used to show interest\nin the game as opposed\nto fully fund a new entry\nto the series. With blatant\ndishonesty also being\nshown by the fact that\nShenmue 3 already has\na Steam Store page, yet\nthe developers have now\ngone back on their word\nto crowdfunders with its\nexclusivity to the Epic\nStore. Here\u2019s hoping that\nthe refunds eventually\ncome through.\nWhat may not be\nreceived particularly well\nare reboots of the Battletoads and Contra series\nwhich both look fairly\nawful, to say the least.\nHaving seen better days,\nEven in low resolution Keanu Reeves is just as beautiful on printed paper as he is on stage // Xbox\nRyo Hazuki also looks down on mistreating fans// Neilo & Ys Net\n\u201cWetwork\nhero returned\nonly in mobile\ngame form\ninstead of an\nactual triple A\ntitle\u201d\nthe Battletoads reboot\nfeatures Rash, Pimple,\nand Zits in cartoonish\nform, the game looks\nlike it plays similar to the\noriginals, but by no means\ndoes it catch its aesthetic.\nContra, on the other hand,\nplaysverydifferentlyfrom\nits predecessors and looks\nnothing like it, bearing\nthe name of Contra in \u2122\nfashion, it appears to be a\nblatant cash grab.\nAll in all, E3 could\nhave gone a lot worse and,\neven then, it was made up\nfor by some absolutely\nbrilliant releases, but\nwhat truly won my heart\nwas the Devolver confer-ence, which took jabs at\nmultiple companies and\neven going so far as to\nrelease a new game which\nis a bootleg collection of\nits other games. Presenting itself in a cinematic\nfashion that continued on\nfrom its previous conference in 2018, Devolver,\ncame across as comedic\nbut not cringey (looking\nat you Anthem confer-ence, dear God that was\npainful to watch). With\nnew horizons being sailed\ntowards in the gaming\nindustry, I\u2019m looking\nforward to see what comes\nof it.\n\u201cAll in all, E3\ncould have\ngone a lot\nworse and,\neven then, it\nwas made up\nfor by some\nabsolutely\nbrilliant\nreleases\u201d\n\n"

Before the newspaper goes on hiatus until\nOctober, it seems only fitting to report on the events\nwhich, to a large extent,\nplayed out just across\nthe park from Imperial\nCollege this April.\nThe afore-mentioned\nenvironmentalmovements\nare a counter-culture of\nthe 21st century, opposing\n\u201cExtinction\nRebellion\nechoes the\nmessage of\nthe Campaign\nfor Nuclear\nDisarmament\u201d\n\u201cExtinction\nRebellion has\nreframed the\ndebate on\nclimate change\nand added\nurgency to\nthe discourse\non climate\nchange\u201d\nthe elements of society\nthey see as culpable for\nenvironmental damage\nand the present climate\ncrisis, much as the coun-ter-cultural movement\nof the `60s opposed war,\nparticularly the nuclear\nvariety. The first environmental movement arose in\nresponse to the over-use\nof the insecticide DDT,\nwhose unintended threat\nto human and natural life\nwas made known by the\nbiologist Rachel Carson\nin her book Silent Spring.\nIs the most recent wave of\nactivism anything new?\nAre Extinction Rebellion,\nand related movements,\nhaving a meaningful\nimpact?\nAs with the movement\nagainst DDT, science has\nbeen the trigger for recent\nprotests. Extinction Rebellion cites the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC)\nreport, which predicts that\nemissions of greenhouse\ngases must reach net zero\nby 2050 in order to avoid\na heating of more than 1.5\ndegrees Celsius, as one of\ntheir sources of motiva-tion. Extinction Rebellion\nechoes the message of the\nCampaign for Nuclear\nDisarmament when they\nargue \u201chumanity, as well\nas life on Earth, is facing a\n\u2018direct existential threat\u2019\u201d.\nExtinction Rebellion\nhas re-framed the debate\non climate change and\nadded urgency to the discourse on climate change\nSecondly, it promotes\nactive participation in\ntackling the climate\ncrisis. The decentralised\nnetworks that it builds up\nin the preparation for the\nprotests give spaces for\ncommunities to meet and\ncampaign on environmental issues. This physical\ninteraction, lacking in\none-way dissemination of\ninformation via traditional\nandsocialmedia,mayhelp\nto achieve the changes in\nlifestyle and culture that\nthe IPCC argue \u201chave a\nconsiderable influence on\nenergy use and associated\nemissions\u201d, and may\ninfluence new groups of\npeople such as high street\nshoppers. Direct action\nforces want to act as a\nrepresentative of the environmental movement not\njust as a citizen, but also\nas a friend, child, parent,\nemployee, or employer.\nOf course, activism\nalone won\u2019t achieve the\ndecreases in emissions\nnecessary to avoid a long-term warming of 1.5\u00b0C,\nbut equally an economy\ngeared for exponential\ngrowth and legislation\nsupporting this will fail.\nUnarguably, the Extinction Rebellion movement\nis controversial. Their\npolicy of advocating\nnon-violent civil disobedience saw 1130 arrests in\nten days from activists. So\nfar seventy people have\nbeen charged but police\nhave admitted that they\nhave limited sentencing\npowers for further arrests.\nExtinction Rebellion made Central London stop to consider climate change for ten days in April // Artur Donaldson\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 21ST\nJUNE, 2019 FELIX\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe actions have included\nacts of rebellion ranging\nfrom unfurling a banner\nsaying \u201cdon\u2019t jail the\ncanaries\u201d from a DLR\ntrain in Canary Wharf in\nresponse to the role of\nthe financial services in\nfunding environmental\ndestruction, to lining\nWestminster Bridge with\nplants during ten days of\nprotest in April. Despite\nbringing central London\nto standstill they received\na significant amount of\nsupport. Just after the\naforementioned protests,\na quarter of 2000 UK\ncitizens who responded\nto a poll by ComRes\nagreed with the statement\n\u201cI support the aims and\ntactics of Extinction Rebellion\u201d, the majority (43\n%) responded that they\ndidn\u2019t know, and a third\ndisagreed.\nThese mixed responses\nsuggest that environmental movements have the\npotential to be divisive.\nUnlike avoiding nuclear\nwar, the benefits and\ncosts of climate change\nmitigation, the challenges\nin achieving it, are less\nobvious. I spoke with a\nGreen party candidate at\na later protest who argued\nthat, to achieve a zero-car-bon economy by the IPCC\ndeadline of 2050, the UK\nneeds to invest in wind\nand solar generation, but\nwas unable to give any\nfigures to support his\nargument nor to counter\nthe challenges of supply\nand demand, the greatest\nchallenge at present.\nGiving people facts is key.\nHuman activities have\ncaused a rise in global\ntemperature of one degree\nCelsius since pre-indus-trial times. Students and\nacademics have the ability\nto testify to these facts,\nand these facts need to be\nheard on the streets.\nFurthermore, civil\ndisobedience can exclude\npeople who could lose the\nright to work, study or the\nability to pursue a certain\nprofession should they be\ncharged. When I visited\nthe protests at Marble\nArch, many protesters\nseemed to be in fairly\nfinancially secure situations and of a left-leaning\npersuasion. Though the\nmovement describes itself\nas non-partisan, some of\nthe messages mixed the\nseparate issue about Brexit\nwith the climate debate.\nIn a country which voted,\nrightly or wrongly, for an\nexit from the EU, mixing\nissues which are not\nrelated is dangerous. If too\nmuch emphasis is placed\non tactics which exclude\nparticipation of certain\nmembers of society, this\ncould be used to paint\nharmful stereotypes of the\nenvironmental movement\nsuch as that of the white\nmiddle-class \u201chippie\u201d or\nthe wealthy, tofu-burg-er-chomping millennial.\nRole-models of all creeds,\ncountries and classes exist\nwithin the environmental movement and can\nsupport those from other\nsections of society to\namplify environmentally\npositive culture. From\nWangari Maathai, the\nfounder of the Green\nBelt movement in Kenya,\nto Greta Thunberg, the\nsixteen-year old standing\nfor the climate outside\nthe Swedish parliament,\nenvironmentalists span all\nages and continents.\nNot all protesters I\nspoke with at recent environmental protests have a\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 21ST\nJUNE, 2019 FELIX\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nsecure income, and it was\nclear that efforts had been\ntaken to avoid religious\nor financial obstacles to\nparticipation. Coaches\nprovided free low-carbon\ntravel from all corners of\nthe country to London and\na self-organized network\nof environmentalists\nprovided accommodation.\nTongue-and-cheek, one\nmight even say that the\nprotests provided benefits\nto London. They temporarily installed a solar\nfarm at Marble Arch and\nprovided a full-scale simulation of a zero-emission\nzone in central London.\nThey also brought social\nco-benefits, protesters\nsupported the local\nhomeless community by\nproviding free food and\ntaking collections for the\npoor.\nSo, is environmental\nactivism an effective\nstrategy to tackling\nclimate change? I argue\nit has a part to play.\nExtinction Rebellion has\nan enormous potential\nto build communities\nand place pressure on\npoliticians. But there is\na risk it could polarize\nopinions on the climate\nchange. Uninformed\nactivists can project a\ndamaging image on the\nenvironmental issue, and\nits demand to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions\nto net zero by 2025 are\npretty radical to say the\nleast. However, activism\ncan help to create communities which support\nchanges in lifestyle which\nmay encounter resistance\nif introduced through\nlegislation. The climate\nemergency requires action\nglobally, and rapidly. Both\ntop-down and bottom-up\napproaches are necessary\nto achieve this.\nThe public uproar from\nSilent Spring resulted in\nthe US administration\nintroducing a nationwide\nban on DDT, though it\nwas only in 1972, a decade\nafter the publication of\nSilent Spring that this\ncame into law. Extinction\nRebellion achieved some\nof its goals more rapidly.\nThe UK government\nannounced a climate\nemergency on 1st May as\na result of pressure from\nthe Extinction Rebellion\nmovement and has committed to net zero carbon\nemissions by 2050. But is\nthis enough?\nNo.\nGovernments alone,\nthrough a top-down\napproach, have limited\nimpetus or ability to\nmake the necessary\nsocial changes to tackle\nthe climate emergency.\nBefore 2050 there will\nbe at least six general\nelections and, as has been\nshown in the US with\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal from\nthe Paris Agreement,\nfuture politicians may\nnot respect words written\non paper by current ones.\nWhat action \u201cthe climate\nemergency\u201d needs is\nnot yet well defined, but\nsurely a cultural shift\nmeans more than banning\nplastic straws. Bottom-up\napproaches from environmental movements can\nhelp to create communities to facilitate changes\nin lifestyle, and hold\ngovernments accountable\nto their commitments.\nSee you next year!\nA warm welcome to the Sustainability\neditors for 2019-20 Anthony Cheuk, Sam\nOwens, and Xiuchen Xu.\nWatch this space and the paperless version\nof the column at felixonline.co.uk/\nExtinction Rebellion even installed solar panels at Marble Arch // Artur Donaldson\n\n"

Our prior instalments have touched on\nsome of the general do\u2019s\nand dont\u2019s of setting up\na tech start up, and also\nour personal journey.\nIn this final issue of the\nterm, Tom and I detail\nImpromptu.\nThe inspiration for the\napp stems from our time\nas students at Imperial\nwhere we found that\nour social life revolved\naround our department.\nUnfortunately we did not\nfeel integrated to the rest\nof the college, let alone\nour surrounding neigh-bourhood, and we would\nhave welcomed the means\nto do things with people\nnearby (to both make\nfriends and explore the\ncapital). Having surveyed,\nwe found this to be a\ncommon theme amongst\nstudents, academics and,\nalso, young professionals\nwho struggle to develop\na social life outside of\ntheir work place. The\noverriding criticism in\nthis regard was that there\nis no efficient means of\ninteracting with fellow\ncitizens and that prevalent\nevents apps simply regurgitate \u201cTimeOut\u201d listings, \u201cThe\ninspiration for\nthe app stems\nfrom our time\nas students at\nImperial\u201d\nor solely cater to dating/\ncorporate events.\nOur solution to this\nproblem was the development of a peer-to-peer\n(p2p) events platform\nwhich tempts users with\nrandom events involving\npeople nearby. When\nthinking about potential\nUSPs, several points were\ncrucial to us. Variety was\nthe first; our own experience had shown that\nGoogle was a powerful\ntool to do specific things\nbut broadening horizons\nby doing new things was\nnot as easy. Spontaneity\nwas the second; despite\nthe wealth of opportunity\nLondon offers, finding\nfriends happy for others\nto join them watching the\nfootball. Furthermore,\nthe nature of Impromptu\nwill benefit amateur\ngraphic. Social media\nwill play a major role in\nour marketing campaigns\nbut we really hope that\nImpromptu will grow organically and build a loyal\nuserbase. We have plans\nthat will enable the app\nto evolve with reference\nto content and to different\ndemographics. We look\nforward to sharing this information in the new term\nalong with updates of our\nprogress over the summer.\nWe are on target to\nlaunch during Freshers\u2019\nweek. Prior to this we\nwill be group testing for\n6 weeks. If you would\nlike to be a part of this\nprocess and have your\nfeedback contribute\ntowards the final\nproduct, please forward\nyour email address to\ni m p ro m p t u s o c i a l @\ngmail.com\nHave a great summer\nbreak and join us in September.....\nISSUE 1726\nFELIX\n13\nTECH tecfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nImpromptu is launching to Imperial students in two months\u2019time // Impromptu\n\u201cOur solution\nto this problem\nwas the\ndevelopment\nof a peer-to-peer events\nplatform\nwhich tempts\nusers with\nrandom events\ninvolving\npeople\nnearby.\u201d\n\u201cOur\nmotivations\nare centred\non enhancing\nthe student\nexperience. \u201d\nTom Burgoyne\nImpromptu\nSpontataneity is at the core of the app // Impromptu\nthings to do at short notice\nis famously problematic.\nThe third was cost; we\nare both passionate about\nensuring students and\ncharities have free access.\nAs cheesy as it may\nsound, our motivations are\ncentred on enhancing the\nstudent experience. These\nUSPs were bolstered by\nthe creation of a unique\nx/y browsing interface,\nand some unique code\nwhich we are not at liberty\nto discuss at this moment.\nPractical examples of\nImpromptu\u2019s use might\nentail coming out of work\nwith the evening free\nand no plans in place. A\nsimple browse of the user\ninterface will provide a\nhost of interesting options.\nOne might find someone\nkeen on playing tennis\nand needing a partner,\na group of girls looking\nfor another to join them\nfor a movie, a tourist in\ntown looking for a local\nto share a drink with, or\nperhaps, even a group of\npromoters, university societies and charities (think\nrecruiting people to food\ndrives etc.).\nThe concept lends itself\nto any city or town with\na university. Our predominant user base will\ncomprise students and\nyoung professionals aged\n18-30. We also endeavour\nto engage local businesses\nthat cater to this demo-\n"

    "content": "Psychedelics research at Imperial College enters a new\nphase\nSCIENCE\nJoe Sheppard\nScience Editor\nT\nhe second phase\nto be exact. This\nyear the newly\nminted Centre\nfor Psychedelic Research\nat Imperial College\nLondon began conducting\na first-of-its-kind phase\nII clinical trial designed\nto test how effective the\nhallucinogenic compound\npsilocybin is at treating\npatients with major depressive disorder versus a\ncurrent prescription anti-depressant, escitalopram.\nWhile several clinical\ntrials using psilocybin\nhave been catching headlines recently, the research\nat Imperial College is\ntaking the next step by\ncomparing psilocybin, the\nactive ingredient in magic\nmushrooms, with the current standard of care, to\nsee just how much better,\nif at all, psychedelics can\nmake the lives of patients.\nWhy the sudden in-in many clinical studies\nthroughout the 50s, the\nspread of psilocybin and\nLSD out of the clinic and\ninto the general public\nworried the American\ngovernment. Afraid that\nthe values of middle-class\nAmericans were being\neroded, the government\nbanned psychedelics,\nlabelling them as being\n\u201cwithout any currently\naccepted medical use in\ntreatment.\u201d Research into\nthe medicinal benefit of\npsychedelic compounds\nwas almost completely\nabandoned by the end of\nthe 1970s and yet the idea\nthat the intense experiences induced through the\npsychedelic state might\nhelp patients reconcile\ngrief or engrained addictive behaviour persisted\nin the minds of a few\npioneers.\nInterest was reignited\nin 2001 following FDA\napproval for a clinical trial\nshowing that psilocybin\ncould reduce obsessive\nbehaviour in patients with\nOCD, and again in 2006\nwith a study showing\nthat psilocybin-induced\nspiritual experiences\ncould have long-lasting\npositive effects on wellbeing and behaviour, even\nin healthy patients. In\neffect, these two studies\nopened the floodgates on\nFDA approval for clinical\ntrials using psychedelics\nand granted long sought\nafter credibility to the\nemotional significance of\n\u201cthe trip\u201d and what is now\ncalled the psychedelic\ntherapy model, in which\npatients without a history\nof schizophrenia are given\nhigh-dose psychedelics\nand are guided through\nthe trip by trained therapists under controlled\nconditions.\nHow does psilocy-state can lead patients\nto find new perspective\non events in their past.\nIndeed, it may be through\nreconnection with the past\nthat the benefits of psilocybin are achieved, in line\nwith a newly proposed\nfeature of depression\ncalled derailment, which\nsuggests that an inability to identify with past\nversions of yourself can\ncause a loss of identity\nand purpose which may\nlead to depression.\nPharmacology versus\ntrial, patients with major\ndepressive disorder will\nbe randomised to receive\npsilocybin at varying\ndosages and six weeks\nof daily escitalopram or\nplacebo, with all patients\nparticipating in guided\npsychotherapy. The effectiveness of both treatments will be determined\nthrough self-assessed\nquestionnaires on depressive symptoms as well as\nfMRI scans of the brain,\npaying special attention to\nareas of the brain sensitive\nto emotional stimuli.\ncybin has been found to\ncause increased amygdala\nactivation in response to\nboth negative and positive\nvisual stimuli and the\nstrength of this activation\npredicted reductions in\nthe severity of symptoms\nin patients with treat-ment-resistant depression.\nThe attenuation of visually\nstimulated amygdala activation in patients receiving antidepressants and\nenhancement in patients\nreceiving psilocybin gives\ncredence to the hypothesis\nthat psilocybin can put\npatients with depression\nback in touch with their\nemotions.\nUsing fMRI to study\nhow psilocybin and SSRIs\ncanalleviatethesymptoms\nof depression despite\ntheir different mechanism\nin the brain can offer\nresearchers insights into\nthe complex neurobiology\nof these conditions. fMRI\nalso offers researchers a\nchance to more objectively assess the magnitude\nof relief from depressive\nsymptoms and, by\ncombining this analysis\nwith questionnaires,\nconclusively demonstrate\nthe therapeutic potential\nof psilocybin-assisted\npsychotherapy. When\nthe results of this study\nare published it will be\ninteresting to see, not\nonly which treatment\noffered the most benefit\nto patients, but also what\naspects of the psyche-delic-trip can predict the\nbest outcomes for patients\nand if these meaningful\nexperiences can be sought\nout and encouraged in our\ndaily lives.\nIf you would like to\nvolunteer for this study,\nplease contact the study\ncoordinator Bruna\nGiribaldi on b.cunha@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nA typical setting for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy\n// Centre for Psychadelics Research\nISSUE 1726\nFELIX\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n8\nterest in psychedelic\ncompounds?\nIt may surprise you\nto know that the idea of\nusing psychedelics during\npsychotherapy has been\naround for some time,\nand can be traced back to\nthe modern rediscovery\nof psychedelics in the\n1940s and 50s. Less\nthan 10 years after its\nrediscovery by renowned\nchemist Albert Hoffman,\npsilocybin was already\nbeing synthesised in commercial labs and sold as a\nnovel psycho-therapeutic\ndrug under the brand\nname indocybin, sharing\na place on the shelf with\nover-the-counter LSD,\nbranded as Delysid.\nDespite showing promise\nas psychotherapeutics\nbin-assisted psychotherapy work?\nThe experiences that\nfollow taking a psychedelic are highly contextual\nand deeply personal, the\nword psychedelic is itself\nderived from the Greek\nwords psyche (mind) and\nd\u0113los (manifest), alluding\nto the highly individual\neffects of taking these\nmolecules. The types of\nexperiences that participants encounter during\nguided sessions can vary\nhugely, but cases of reconciliation with past grief,\ndeep personal introspection or feelings of bliss\nare consistently reported.\nThis is an important\nfactor in the treatment\nmechanism of the psychedelic therapy model.\nRather than blunting the\nemotions of patients with\ndepression, which is a\ncommonly reported side\neffect of antidepressants,\npsilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has granted\nthem insights into the\nemotional root of their\nissues, with some patients\nrevealing that they had\nachieved one of the most\nsignificant emotional\nbreakthroughs of their\nlives during psilocybin-as-sisted psychotherapy. It is\neasy then to misinterpret\npsilocybin as a wonder\ndrug which can fast-track\nthe benefits of visiting a\npsychologist or taking an-tidepressants, which often\nrequire months of sessions\nor repeat prescriptions to\nachieve results. But this\nis not the case, psilocybin\nis thought to push the\nbrain into a more flexible\nstate wherein negative\nthought patterns can be\nloosened and through\nheightened association\nnew personal insights can\nbe uncovered. Combined\nwith the support of trained\ntherapists, the psychedelic\npsychedelics\nRather than aiming to\ntreat a single chemical\nimbalance in the brain,\nas do traditional antide-pressants, called selective\nserotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), psilocybin\nassisted psychotherapy\nuses the brain states\ncreated through altering\nthat chemistry to bring\nabout lasting emotional\nimprovement. But how\ngood is it? Does the psychological benefit persist\nor do patients relapse\nshortly afterwards? The\nlack of head-to-head\ncomparison has so far\nprevented researchers\nfrom objectively quantifying the benefit of\npsychedelics versus anti-depressants. This is where\nthe clinical trial at ICL\ncomes into play. In this\n\u201cDoes the\npsychological\nbenefit persist\nor do patients\nrelapse shortly\nafterwards?\u201d\nAs previous research\nhas shown, depressed\npatients show greater activation of the amygdala, an\narea of the brain sensitive\nto emotional stimuli,\nwhen they are confronted\nwith visual stimuli that\nevoke negative reactions,\nsuch as angry or fearful\nfaces, a response that is\ndampened by antidepres-sants.

Make sure you are protected!\nSCIENCE\nOpenshaw\nScience Writer\nW\nhen Max\nwas 18, he\nwoke up\none morning feeling very unwell.\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t get up,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cI had been out\nthe night before and my\nboyfriend at the time\nthought it was just a\nhangover, but his flatmate\ncame in and said I looked\ntruly awful.\u201d Eventually,\nMax was taken in a taxi\nto Whitechapel Hospital.\nIt was there that he was\ndiagnosed with measles.\nNow 28 and a freelance\nart director, Max is lucky\nenough to have made\na full recovery. He did,\nhowever, miss the first six\nweeks of his degree. \u201cI\u2019ve\nkind of blocked it out, I\nwas so unwell. I had just\nstarted an art degree, and\nI was away for nearly half\nthe term,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cWe have all\nbeen urged to\ncheck that we\nhave had two\ndoses of the\nMMR jab.\u201d\n\u201cThere are\nplenty of\nreasons a\nstudent may\nhave missed\ntheir MMR, not\njust as a result\nof vaccine\nhesitancy\u2019.\u201d\nDespite having been on\nthe brink of elimination\nin 2015, unfortunately\nmeasles cases like Max\u2019s\nare once again on the rise\nin the UK. Last week,\nImperial students were\ninformed by email of\nan outbreak in the local\ncommunity. As a result,\nwe have all been urged\nto check that we have\nhad the recommended\ntwo doses of the MMR\n(Measles, Mumps and\nRubella) jab. But the\nreasons why we may have\nmissed out on having the\nvaccine as children are not\nstraightforward.\nWe all think we know\nthe story. \u201cIn 1998,\nAndrew Wakefield\npublished a, now discred-ited, paper linking the\nMMR to autism,\u201d Public\nHealth trainee Dr Catherine Huntley explains,\n\u201cleading to intense media\ncoverage, which had\nan important impact on\nMMR coverage.\u201d Those\nchildren who missed out\non having the MMR as\na result of the scandal\nare now populating UK\nuniversities. \u201cThis group\nof people is more susceptible to measles because\nimmunity levels are low,\u201d\nDr Huntley continues.\nAs a result of the\nscandal, the latest wave of\nmeasles cases can, in part,\nbe attributed to Andrew\nWakefield. And vaccine\nhesitancy, as it is politely\nknown, is thriving once\nagain. Social media is\nbringing together communities of so-called \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019, feeding them\nfake news and fuelling\nscepticism of expert\nopinion (which, for the\nrecord, is that the MMR\nvaccine is very safe). It is\nthe perfect populist storm.\nOr at least, this is the story\nwe read in the papers.\nBut the \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019\nare only partly to blame.\nThere are other reasons\nwhy Imperial students\nmight have missed their\nMMR: a childhood spent\nliving overseas, or a\nchange of GPs at a critical\nmoment. I grew up in\nLondon, yet I only had\nmy MMR when I arrived\nat Imperial. My parents\nsimply forgot to take me\nfor my jabs. Max, too,\ndid not miss his MMR\non purpose - his family\nmoved to the UK from\nHong Kong when he was\nsix and his records got lost\non the way.\nFear of being brandished as an \u2018anti-vaxxer\u2019, or an assumption that,\nbecause you have pro-vac-cine parents, that you\nmust have had the MMR,\nmay in fact be acting as\nbarriers to checking that\nyou\u2019re covered. Instead,\nit\u2019s possible that, like Max\nand me, you just slipped\nthrough the net. It will\nonly take one phone call\nto your GP surgery for\nyou to find out. If you\ndon\u2019t have a family doctor\nor you\u2019re unable to find\nout your immunisation\nhistory, Dr Huntley says\n\u201cYou can go ahead and\narrange to be vaccinated\nagain\u201d. It is safer to do\nthis than to potentially be\nleft unprotected.\nI asked Max what\nadvice he would give to\nsomeone trying to decide\nwhether or not to have the\nMMR. \u201cI would definitely\nhave it,\u201d he said. \u201cMeasles\nis a horrible sickness to\nhave. It\u2019s very contagious\nand can be dangerous\nto others.\u201d Measles is\npreventable, and it will\ntake little effort to check\nthat you\u2019re protected.\nSo, don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t\nassume, just go and check.\nIt is only together that\nwe can bring an end to\nmeasles in the UK.\nHow to recognise measles: symptoms include fever, a cold, and, eventually, a spreading red-brown rash // Wikimedia\nMadeleine\n\n"

People\nmade these demands clear\nthrough peaceful sit-ins,\nand were met with the\nuse of force by Sudan\u2019s\nmilitia. That didn\u2019t stop\nSudan\u2019s people from\ncontinuing to demonstrate\ntremendous strength and\ncourage at the face of\nbrutality and harsh inhu-manity, and eventually\nled to the toppling and\noverthrowing of OmarAl-Bashir on 11th\nApril\n\u2013 a revolutionary success\ndeemed legendary by\ninternational spectators,\nand deemed tradition\nby the locals, who have\npeacefully toppled two\nprevious governments,\nonce in 1964, and again in\n1985.\nThe Rapid Support\nForces, or the RSF, led\nby Mohamed Hamdan\nDagalo \u2013 better known\nas Hemedti - replaced\nBashir\u2019s rule following\nhis overthrowing on\n11th\nApril, as well as the\noverthrowing of his successor less than 48 hours\nlater. They proposed a\nthree-year transitional\nperiod in which a military\ngovernment was to lead\nthe country, but were\nmet with resistance from\nthe Sudanese public\nthrough peaceful sit-ins.\nThe public made their\ndemands very clear\nthrough the Sudanese\nProfessionals Association\n(SPA), as their \u201cofficial\u201d\nvoice, and a democratically elected civilian\ngovernment topped the\nlist of demands.\nThis time round, the\nprotestors were met with\na horrific slaughtering\ncampaign led by the RSF,\naka the rebranded Janjaweed (which translates\nto \u201cdevils on horseback\u201d).\nSystematic rape of men\nand women was being\ncarried out on the roads\nof the capital, Khartoum,\nwith endless accounts of\nchildren having had to\nwatch their parents being\nraped in front of their own\neyes.

    "content": "ISSUE 1726\nFELIX\n32\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nINVESTMENT\nTom Alston\nInvestment Editor\nICIS Co-Editor\nA\nt the beginning\nof last year\nMiFID II was\ni n t r o d u c e d\nto make the financial\nindustry more transparent.\nOne key aspect of this is\nthe move from bundled\nto unbundled products\nbrokerage firms provide.\nPreviously, a fund manager buying a security\nthrough a broker would\npay a hefty commission.\nThis would cover the cost\nof putting the buyer and\nseller parties together as\nwell as the research that\nthe brokerage firm provided to the fund to educate\nit on which security to\nbuy. The research and\ntransaction were bundled\nunder one cost, hence, the\nfirms provided bundled\nproducts. This research\nwould include access to\nanalysts who specialise\nin specific asset classes\nand industries, libraries\nof thousands of research\npapers as well as of\nmeetings with executives.\nHowever, this provides a\ndark cloud under which\nthese brokerage firms\noperate. Who do they\nrepresent and are they\nproviding the best deal\nfor their customers? This\nis where MiFID II is\nsupposed to shake up the\nresearch to remain unique\nand competitive following\nthe introduction of the\nlegislation. So have their\nradical expectations been\nmet? It has certainly had\na global effect. A recent\nreport from Greenwich\nAssociates found that\nmany US investment\nmanagers are contemplat-ing, under pressure from\ntheir clients, unbundling.\nThis is thought to be due\nnot only to the fact that\nany fund manager moving\nmoney for European\nclients has to comply with\nMiFID II but also the\nincrease in transparency\nis seen as the way forward\nin financial legislation.\nMiFID II is also reshaping\nthe industry. With research\nfirms having to offer\nmore bespoke services to\nclients, meaning fewer analysts covering a specific\nniche in the market, many\nanalysts fear the security\nof their career. With\ndecreasing demand and\nincreasing competition, as\nfund managers decrease\ntheir dependency on larger\nall round brokerage firms,\nmany will perish in the\nstruggle to come out on\ntop. A clear indication of\nthis shift is the comment\nRichard Buxton, Cheif\nExecutive of Old Mutual\nGlobal Investors Cheif,\nmakes in the Financial\nTimes article MiFID II\nleads to an exodus of sell-side analysts, in which\nhe states his firm has\nbecome \u201cinundated with\nCVs\u201d. Who would blame\nthem when JP Morgan\nis offering access to its\nequity research for as\nlittle as $10,000 yearly.\nFear not though, for it is\nnot all doom and gloom.\nMiFID II has paved a\nway for a brighter future,\nespecially for smaller\nbrokerage firms. Their\nability to provided very\ndetailed analysis on a\nmarket niche gives them\nthe edge over their larger\ndominant counterparts.\nAs Mahesh Narayan at\nThomson Reuters states\nin an interview with\nFinextra, smaller firms\nindustry.

How do you\nvalue financial research?\nDoes this mean the end\nfor brokerage firms?\nHow will this affect the\nglobal financial industry?\nSpecialised Firms Before\nthe implementation of\nMiFID II, with the financial industry travelling in\nsuch an ambiguous direc-tion, uncertainty was ripe.\nBrokerage and research\nfirms knew there was\na rocky road ahead.

We\u2019ve\nreceived alo whopping 1768 responses to our call to arms, from a wide cross-section of the Imperial populus.\nOur committed team of Felix reporters turned \u2018sexy-time\u2019 investigators (STIs, if you will) have spent the better half of yesterday trawling through\nall the data, filtering through all the responses to make sense of all your bedroom shenanigans. To be quite honest, some of the responses to the\nsurvey were, well, unconventional, but we\u2019re not here to judge. However, we might be signing up for Counselling.\nThis year, we thought we\u2019d switch up our writing style just a smidge (why take things seriously when none of you lot did).\nSo, without further ado, here\u2019s the 2019 Felix Sex survey.\nWho took the survey?\nAssuming our very scientific sex survey is\nindeed indicative of Imperial as a whole,\nWhich way do you swing? Well, most Imperial students\n(78.6%) identify as straight, with the non-heterosexual\ncomponent taking up the remaining 21.2%. These\ninclude people identifying as bisexual (11.6%),\nhomosexual (5.7%), pansexual (1.1%), queer (0.8%),\nasexual (0.7%) and other (1.3%), as unfortunately our\nlist is not nearly comprehensive enough to include other\npossible sexualities (e.g. demisexual, aromantic, etc.)\nAs with everything\nvaguely fun\nat Imperial,\nundergraduates are\noverrepresented in the\nSex Survey this year,\ncomprising nearly\n90% of respondents.\nUndergrads\n89%\nPostgrads\n7.4%\nAlumni\n7.4% Staff\n1%\n79% Heterosexual 21% Non-hetero\n55% Bisexual\n27%\nHomosexual\n6% Other\n3% Asexual\n4% Queer\n5% Pansexual\nthen the skew in the male:female ratio (61:38) should come as no surprise to anyone. Nonbinary (don\u2019t identify fully as male or female) account for 0.9% of respondents, and 0.4% of all\nparticipants identify as a gender different to what was assigned to them at birth.\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n30%\n11 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24\nShoutout to the 9 people who identified\nas other - not sure how you can other\nyourself in this category, but thanks for your\ninput anyway! We\u2019re assuming you\u2019re just\nunemployed.\nContrary to popular belief, most Imperial students have indeed had \u2018the\nsex\u2019! In hindsight, this would actually make sense, given that it\u2019s a good\nform of exercise (finding a sexual partner that is, but also the sex part).\nThe data suggests that the average Imperial student loses their\nvirginity at 17 years, 7 months and 27 days, at approximately 2:24 in\nthe afternoon, give or take a few decades. This would indicate that the\naverage Imperialist pops their cherry just in time to start uni - maybe to\nprevent appearing inexperienced following their first conquest at Sports\nNight.\n18% Virgin\nAge\n\n"

Considering\nICSM is the pit of all debauchery this should come as no surprise. Surprisingly, JMC has redeemed itself to land a spot in 3rd, at around 9 times a\nmonth.

Along\nwith Yusef Salaam (Ethan\nHerisse), Raymond\nSantana (Marquis\nRodriguez) and Antron\nMcCray (Caleel Harriss)\nthey join in with a throng\nof boys headed to Central\nPark. At dusk, dozens\nstrong,thiscrowing,joyful\ncrowd runs into the park,\nraising a ruckus in their\nwake. Even without prior\nknowledge of the real-life\nfates of \u2018The Central Park\nFive\u2019 we expect tragedy\nto strike because we are\nconditioned to know that\nespecially in film, but also\nin life, unbridled shows of\nfreedom rarely go unpun-ished, particularly not for\nkids who look like Kevin,\nKorey, Yusef, Raymond\nand Antron.\nIn the park, jubilance\nquickly sours to something with an edge -scraps break out amongst\nthe group; when the\npolice show up, the boys\nscatter, stumbling through\nthe undergrowth. Unbeknownst to them, across\nthe park, Trisha Meili\n(Alexandra Templer) has\nbeen dragged off the path\nwhilst jogging, brutally\nraped and left for dead.\nFaced with the task of\nfinding Meili\u2019s assailant\nand with no leads save for\na conference room full of\nblack teenagers arrested\nfor \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d,\nDetective Linda Fairstein\n(Felicity Huffman) seizes\nan opportunity.\nWhat follows is a\nlesson in the lethal chasms\nin modern American life.\nFarstein, who is white and\nmiddle aged, is unable to\ncorrectly parse the slang\nphrase \u201cwiling out\u201d,\nwritten on a report of the\nboys\u2019 activities, to mean\n\u201cacting out\u201d. Instead, she\nbecomes convinced the\nchildren were \u201cwilding\u201d.\nThe kids held in custody\nquickly turn from possible\nwitnesses to the rape\nto probable suspects.\nFarstein condemns the\ntwelve and thirteen year\nolds out too late, to be feral\nanimals on the rampage.\nWith swift and profound\nvenom she labels the\nchildren, whose names she\ncannot remember, thugs\nand predators - scum to\nscrubbed away.\nDuring the four part\nseries, we witness \u2018The\nCentral Park Five\u2019 being\nconvicted, imprisoned,\nand then in 2002, acquitted after a spontaneous\nconfession from a serial\nrapist. Ava DuVernay\u2019s\nemotive direction which\nputs the viewer in the\nplace of the five accused,\nmakes When They See Us\nintensely painful viewing\n- I found it difficult to\nwatch each episode all\nthe way through in one\ngo.

Huffman\nproves a genius bit of (un-intentional) meta-casting,\nas her real life college admissions scandal simmers\noff screen, her presence is\na constant reminder that\nthe law views all as equal,\nbut some more equal than\nothers. The young actors\nplaying the principal\nfive are extraordinary in\nportraying children whose\ninnocence is quickly\nchipped away by pain,\namongst them, Jharrel\nJerome, who played adolescent Kevin in Moonlight, gives a particularly\nshining performance.\nQuite by chance this\nweek I was reading about\nCharles Foster, an Oxford\nprofessor who lived a\nsummer as a badger\n(including eating worms\nand crawling about on all\nfours through the Welsh\ncountryside). Foster, by\nhis own explanation, had\nundertaken this unconventional exercise as a way of\nstripping away the trappings of what it meant to\nbe human - to ally himself\nwith the bestial parts of\nhis being (though not of\ncourse, it must be said, to\nthe extent of eschewing a\nbook deal or several interviews with high profile\nnational newspapers). I\ncouldn\u2019t get Foster out\nof my head as I watched\nWhen They See Us. What\nbetter delineates what\nprivilege really means?\nA white, well regarded\nlawyer, spends months in\na dug out \u201csett\u201d, feasting\non worms and is called\nan eccentric, profound,\nfree thinker; a group of\nblack children from the\nprojects come home late\nfrom school and are called\nsavage animals by public\nofficials, and locked away\nfor decades for a crime\nthey did not commit.\ndo anything\u201d, Antron\u2019s\nfather tells his son in one\nof the most powerful\nscenes of the first episode,\nbegging him to falsely\nconfess: \u201cThey will lie\non us.

But recently,\nresearchers think that they\nhave found the one major\nreason behind the event.\nApparently, it was\noxygen. \u201cMore specifi-cally, what we have found\nis that the variations in\noxygen concentrations\nduring the period can be\ncorrelated with cycles\nof \u2018boom and bust\u2019 in\nthe biodiversity of the\nCambrian. Higher concentrations of oxygen are\nfound in periods where\nspecies thrived; lower\nones are related to extinction events,\u201d says Dr.\nTianchen He, one of the\nleading researchers from\nthe University of Leeds.\nThe researchers\nmeasured oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere\nat the time by studying\ntwo isotopes of sulphur\n\u201ccorrelations\nbetween\noxygen\nabundance\nand the\nblooming of\nlife coud not\nbe clearer\u201d\n\u201coxygen\nvariations...\ngave way\nto other\nenvironmental\nand geological\nfactors\u201d\nand carbon that are\npresent in rocks of the\nperiod excavated in the\nbanks of the Lena River,\nSiberia. In a chemical\nprocess known as reduc-tion, compounds with\nboth oxygen and sulphur\nor oxygen and carbon\nlose their oxygen atoms\n(they are \u201creduced\u201d), and\noxygen in gas form is\nreleased. Thus, when high\nconcentrations of reduced\ncarbon and sulphur are\nfound in rocks from the\ntime, it can be deduced\nthat the amount of oxygen\nin the atmosphere was\nalso substantially large.\nThe variation of\noxygen in the rocks\nwas compared to past\npalaeontological worldwide records on species\nbiodiversity throughout\nthe Cambrian, and the\ncorrelation between\noxygen abundance and\nthe blooming of life could\nnot be clearer. \u201cThis cycle\ncontinued for 40 million\nyears, causing micro-ex-tinction events when\noxygen concentrations decreased,\u201d says co-author\nProfessor Graham Shields\nfrom University College\nLondon. \u201cThere is a\nsingular, final and globally\nevidenced episode of oxygenation around 500 Ma\nat the end of the Cambrian\nPeriod called the SPICE\nevent. The subsequent\ngeological period, the\nOrdovician, was quiet by\ncomparison.\u201d\nIt seems that oxygen\nvariations were instrumental for explaining the\nradiation of multicellular\nlife, but, once this class\nof organisms was estab-lished, it gave way to\nother environmental and\ngeological factors as the\nmain driving force behind\nbiodiversity dynamics.\nThe end of the Ordovician\n(440 million years ago)\nsaw a major extinction\nevent that drastically\nreduced the number of\nmarine species. This time,\nthough, it was a global\nglaciation that caused the\ncatastrophe.\nThe researchers are\nto be analysed in order to\nconfirm that the variations\nwere, indeed, a global\nphenomenon. Provisional\nresults from rocks found\nin China appear to comply\nwith the hypothesis. \u201cWe\nhave found a similar\npattern at least for one of\nthe excursions in South\nChina. However, we are\nstill working to confirm\nour findings in Morocco\nand Mongolia,\u201d says Dr.\nHe.\nOne of the most\nessential elements for\nour survival was most\nprobably instrumental in\ntriggering the changes\nthat made us what we are.\nBreathing not only keeps\nyou alive, but may also\nhave been responsible for\ngenerating multicellular\nlife in the first place.

Why don\u2019t\nyou take a look at what\ntwo participants this year\nremember from their first\ntime in the Holy Land.\nMohammed Sakir\nMahmood, Medecine:\n\u201cIsrael is rich with\nhistory and controversy.\nMainstream media today\nfocuses on the political\nconflict within the region.\nHowever, what the Israeli\nSociety has achieved\nis moving the spotlight\naway from politics\ntowards something that\nis undeniably Israeli\nto its core: the start-up\nnation. Many students at\nImperial College have\nbeen involved in the entrepreneurial world, or at\nthe very least, have heard\nthe term thrown around\nin discussion; but experiencing a nation which has\nbuilt its current standing\non innovation was truly\nsomething else.\nHuman capital is a key\nresource in the country,\nand a mindset of challenging the status quo is\ncommonplace. The combination of the discipline\ninstilled by compulsory\nmilitary service, and the\ncountry\u2019s focus on STEM\neducation, has produced\ninnovations such as\nMobileye and Pillcam.\nIt was truly a privilege\nto visit establishments\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nImperial College\nsuch as the Technion,\nthe Hebrew University\nof Jerusalem and the\nWeizmann Institute \u2014\nthe birthplace of many\nof these world-changing\ntechnologies.\nAs well as the\nwide-ranging tech visits,\nthe programme included\nmany opportunities to\nexplore the country\u2019s rich\nculture and natural beauty.\nA highlight of the trip was\nclimbing Masada to watch\nthe sunrise amongst the\nbeautiful vistas surrounding the mountain; the\nsignificance of the place\nwas made apparent by the\nhistory lesson we received\nfrom our tour guide, Ilan\nBloch. The story of King\nHerod\u2019s retreat and the\nJewish settlers was simply\nfascinating. Israeli food is\nalso something to behold,\nfrom the deliciously\nsweet and creamy Malabi\nto the rich and savoury\nShakshuka \u2014 needless\nto say our appetites were\nwhetted well.\nLast, but not least, the\nreligious significance of\nIsrael wasn\u2019t lost to us.\nThe Bahai gardens in\nHaifa was a spectacle to\nbehold indeed, with lush\ntrees lining the walkways\nadorned with gleaming\nwhite marble, all in the\npresence of tomb of the\nBahaUllah. Jerusalem,\nbeing a religious epicentre\nfor Jews, Muslims and\nChristians, showed us\nhow these groups live\ntogether.\nThe committee of the\nIsraeli Society should be\nlauded for their efforts,\nas the trip was a truly\nmonumental achievement\nthat they should be proud\nof. Their efforts led to\nstudents from all departments and many different\nwalks of life coming\ntogether and creating\nmemories to be cherished\nas well as lifelong friend-ships.

Each of us had preconceptions of Israel, and\nwe set out to see what the\ncountry could offer.\nWhat we got was a\nglimpse into an ancient\nculture, a story of a\npeople whose resilience\nwas embodied, not only\nby their famous entrepreneurial spirit but also\nby an unending struggle\nto find their place in the\nworld. This story was told\nby the spectacular sights\nand sounds we immersed\nourselves in, from the\nblood fraught history of\nMasada, to the harrowing\nnarrative of the Holocaust\nMuseum and the bustling\nnightlife of Jerusalem and\nTel-Aviv.

Notably,\nthe circadian rhythm, an\ninternal clock that determines our sleep-wake\npatterns, is hereditary (so\nif you\u2019re having trouble\ncatching those worms,\nyour parents may be\nto blame!).
