Ecuador. French\nGuiana, Guyana, Panama, Surinam, Venezuela. Bolivia (suspected).\nAsia- Bangladesh (north and east), Burma, China (Hainan Is and\nsouthern provinces), India (NE\u2014Orissa State and Assam plus\nUttar, Andhra & Madhya Pradesh), Indonesia (Kalimantan, Irian\nJaya, Java, Sumatra), Kampuchea, Laos, Malaysia (Pennisular and\nSabah & Sarawak), Nicobar & Andaman Is, Nepal (Makwanpur\nDist), Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam.\nOceania- Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands (West), Vanuatu.\nAfrica- Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Comoro Is,\nMadagascar, Zanzibar.\nAreas from which Fansidar resistance is reported (suspected):\nBrazil, Indonesia, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, Thailand.\nAreas from which Maloprim resistance is reported: Kenya,\nTanzania (especially Dar es Salaam).\nPHLS Malaria Reference Laboratory. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\nTips for health care while\nabroad\nFood and drink Always boil tap water or use\nsterilis ing tablets. Never drink un pasteurised or un boiled milk. Peel or well wash in boiled\nor bottled water all uncooked fruit,\nvegetables and salad. Have very small\nhelpings of food new to you. If necessary\ndrink bottled water. These recommendations\nare made because diarrhoea is a common\nproblem for the traveller and is due to\nphysical or chemical properties in the food\nor due to infection. Immunisation against\ncholera and typhoid do not give complete\nimmunity from these diseases.\nSkin care\nMake sure that your feet are adequately\ncared for and that you have well-fitting\nshoes. Blisters which may become infected\nseverely limit your mobility.\nMake sure you are adequately covered\nagainst bright sun and use a suntan lotion.\nOver-exposure can lead to quite profound\nillness at the beginning of a holiday.\nPersonal hygiene\nAlways wash your hands before eating or\nhandling food, particularly if you are\ncamping.\nHeat Exhaustion\nIf you sweat a lot your body will lose both\nfluid and salt. This can lead you to feel\nunwell with headaches, dizziness and\nnausea. You should therefore drink plenty\nof fluid and take extra salt.\nDiarrhoea\nIf you develop diarrhoea do not eat solid\nfood initially and take some anti-diarrhoea\npreparation. Make sure that your fluid\nintake is high. Remember you are losing\nfluids in sweat and in diarrhoea and must\nmake up this loss as well as maintain your\nnormal fluid intake. Ten or twelve pints in\n24 hours is not excessive. The same advice is\ngiven for vomiting.\nOn your return to the UK\n1. Remember to continue taking your\nanti-malarial tablets.\n2. If you become ill remember to tell your\ndoctor that you have been abroad and which\ncountries you have visited. Malaria, for\nexample, may occur up to fifteen months\nafter leaving a malaria area.\nFor further information contact a doctor\nor a nurse at the Health Centre or come in\nand collect leaflet SA35 entitled Protect your\nhealth abroad of which a large number of\ncopies have been ordered.\nThanks are due to the Malaria Reference\nLibrary at the Institute of Hygiene and\nTropical Medicine for permission to\nreproduce the map showing the incidence of\nmalaria.\nTessa Addenbrooke\nPage101 June 3,1983 FELIX\n\n"

But drinking is a process which involves all sorts of\nchoices. You chose what to drink, when to drink, with whom\nto drink and, of course, how much to drink.\nThe BBC programme What's Your Poison? and the BBC\npublication of the same name look more closely at all these\nchoices. If you want to put your drinking onto a sensible and\nhealthy footing, then you should watch the programmes and\nread the book.\nThis leaflet concentrates on your own drinking style.\nHow much are you drinking?\nThe first thing you should do is to try to measure how much\nyou drink. The best way to do this is to work out how much\nyou actually drank last week. Begin with yesterday and work\nbackwards one day at a time. Although the figures are\napproximate, you can use the basic scoring unit of one drink\nas follows:\n=\n1\n=\n1\n=\n2\n=\n3\n=\n7\n1 litre bottle of wine =10\n1 bottle of sherry or port =12\nhalf bottle of spirits =15\nWork out the total for each day and then the total for the\nweek. Try to be as accurate as possible.\nNow look at the TOTAL column. If your daily rate was\nnever more than 6 and your weekly total was under 30, then\nyou score A. If your daily rate was sometimes between 7 and 10 and your\nweekly total was under 50, then you score B. If you daily rate was regularly between 11 and 15 or your\nweekly total was between 51 and 75, then you score C. If you daily rate was ever more than 16 or your weekly total\nwas more than 76, then you score D. Before checking what these scores mean, you should\nanswer the following quiz as well.\nPut a tick against those questions to which you would\nanswer 'yes'. You must answer 'yes' to at least one statement\nin each question. If none of the statements are exactly right\nfor you, choose the one which is nee. est to your position.\nWhat kind of drinker?\n1. If I was advised to give up drinking for the sake of my health:\n(a) I could do so easily\n(b)I could do so but I'd miss it\n(c)I could do so but with difficulty\n(d)I could only do so if I had help\n(e)I don't think I could do it\n2.

    "content": "IWELFARE SUPPLEMENT!\nHealth and Travel Abroad\nWhether you are going abroad for holiday\nor work, a brief conference or a more\nprotracted posting, on an expedition of\nexploration or to visit family and friends,\nadvice on health matters and specifically on\nprotection against disease can be obtained\nfrom the Health Centre. Immunisation\nclinics are held on Monday, Wednesday and\nFridays from 2:30 to 3:30pm, no appointment is needed, no charge is made and any\nmember of Imperial College or the Royal\nCollege of Music may attend. At these\nclinics advice may be obtained not only\nabout im munis ation but also about any\nhealth questions related to your travel.\nGeneral Advice\n1. Plan well ahead. Some im munis ation schedules require eight weeks to be\neffectively completed but if less time is\navailable some protection can still be\noffered.\n2. Find out about the health risks in the\ncountry/countries to which you are going.\nFriends or colleagues already there,\nembassies and travel agents as well as\ndoctors and nurses in the Health Centre can\nhelp you.\n3. Consult your doctor about any medical\ncondition which requires continuous\nmedication. Make sure that you have\nadequate supplies of medication for the\njourney and first few weeks at least abroad.\nMake sure also that there is a source of\nsupply in the country to which you are\ngoing\u2014a lost suitcase containing your\ninsulin or oral contraceptives or any other\nregular form of medication is often more\nthan a mere embarrassment.\n4. Consult your doctor also about any\nmedical symptoms you may have and allow\nenough time, if this is possible, to have any\nnecessary examination and special investigations done. Glandular fever in a Land Rovei\nis very uncomfortable!\n5. Have a dental check-up before going\nabroad for more than a short time or if you\nhave any doubts about your teeth.\n6. If you are going to Bulgaria, Poland,\nRomania, Iceland, Hong Kong, and in some\ncases Austria, take your National Health\nService card with you. You may require it to\nobtain treatment.\n7. Take a simple first aid kit containing at\nleast an anti-diarrhoea preparation, an\nantiseptic cream, dressings, a supply of\naspirin or paracetamol, water-purifying\ntablets and insect repellants. Sun-screen\npreparations may be as necessary in Iceland\nas in India.\nSpecial disease protection (ie im munis ation or\nvaccination)\nImmunisation is possible against the\nfollowing diseases: polio, typhoid, yellow\nfever, tuberculosis, tetanus, cholera, rabies,\nhepatitis.\nImmunisation against all except yellow\nfever, rabies and tuberculosis can be done at\nthe t Health Centre. Notice is needed for\ninjection of gamma glob ul in against\nhepatitis but otherwise all vaccines are held\nin stock. Yellow fever and rabies injections\nare available at the British Airways\nImmunisation Centre, 75 Regent Street,\nLondon W l, telephone 01-439 9584 from\n8:30 to 16:30 on Mondays to Fridays.\nCharges are made by British Airways for all\nim munis at ions they give.\nSome countries require evidence of\nim munis ation against cholera and/or yellow\nfever. It is always wise to ask for a yellow-fever certificate since the injection lasts for\nten years and even if the certificate is not\npresently a legal requirement for the country\nto which you are going it may become so\nwithin the next ten years.\nWhen attending the im munis ation clinic\nremember to tell the nurse or doctor if you\nare unwell, if you have any allergies, regular\nmedication or if you are pregnant.\nThe Immunisations\n1. Polio. An oral vaccine usually\nadministered on a sugar lump. A primary\ncourse is offered to all babies in the UK and\nin many other countries. This consists of\nthree doses at six-weekly intervals.\nThereafter a booster dose at five yearly\nintervals is recommended for people of any\nage travelling to an endemic area. A full\nFELIXI [June 3,19831\nprimary course should be taken if you have\nnot had one before.\n2. Tetanus. This again is offered to all\ninfants in the UK. It is given as an injection\ncombined with dip theria and often\nwhooping cough (DPT or Triple Vaccine)\nand in this form has been offered since the\nlate 1950s. A person who has had a primary\ncourse consisting of three injections at\nintervals of six to twelve weeks between the\nfirst two and six to twelve months between\nthe second two needs a booster of one\ninjection at ten-yearly intervals.\n3. Typhoid. Immunisation is advised for\nthose travelling overland or intending to\nspend considerable periods of time in areas\nwhere hygiene or sanitation standards are\nlow. Two injections at a four to six week\ninterval constitute a course. Thereafter a single booster at three-yearly intervals is\nrecommended.\n4. Cholera. This is now a widespread\ndisease to which at least partial protection is\ngiven by im munis ation. This consists of a single injection and the immunity given lasts\nfor six months.\n5. Yellow Fever. This occurs in Central\nAfrica and South America. A single\ninjection is given and it is often recommended that it be the first injection of a comprehensive im munis ation schedule.\n6. Rabies. Immunisation against this\ndisease, which is contracted following a bite\nfrom an infected animal, is available as a course of two injections at an interval of\nfour weeks. It is not usually recommended\nroutinely for travellers going overseas except\nfor those who, from the nature of their\nwork, are at special risk of contracting the\ndisease eg agricultural, veterinary and\nscientific staff.\n7. Hepatitis A and gamma glob ul in. Hepatitis A is common in countries with\npoor sanitation and those intending to travel\noverland or to camp are advised to have\ngamma glob ul in. This provides some\nimmunity for three to six months.\n8. Tuberculosis. People who have not had\na BCG injection (usually given in the UK at\nschool at the age of 11 to 13) are advised to\nbe skin-tested to ascertain whether they have\nimmunity to tuberculosis. This test can be\ndone at the Health Centre. If you are not\nimmune aBC G vaccination can be\narranged.\n9. Malaria prevention. Malaria is\nendemic in many parts of the world as is\nshown on the accompanying map. One bite\nfrom an infected mosquito during a single\novernight stop in a malarial area can lead to\nthe disease. Prevention is partly achieved by\ntaking anti-malarial drugs appropriate to\nthe area. Advice about the drugs to be taken\nshould be obtained from the Health Centre\nsince the malaria parasite is becoming\nresistant in different areas to different drugs.\nThe anti-malarial drug is taken regularly\nstarting one week before departure, while in\nthe malarial area and for six weeks after\nleaving the area. Many preparations need\nonly be taken once a week.\nOther measures such as the use of a mosquito-net, wearing adequate clothing to\ncover arms, legs as well as trunk and the use\nof insect repellants should also be taken.\nTessa Addenbrooke j \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HH^ H Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "IWELFARE SUPPLEMENT!\nColds* and\nCoughs\nI A cold is the most common infection that we\nsee in the surgery. It can be caused by a wide\nrange of viruses, and complete immunity is\ndifficult to achieve, hence having several\ncolds in the course of one year is not\nunusual. Again, because of the different\nviruses involved, symptoms will vary from\nperson to person and from cold to cold.\nHowever all cold infections are self-limiting,\nthe body's immune system clearing the virus\nfrom infected cells after a week or so. Being\na viral infection, antibiotics are ineffective\nand therefore treatment is aimed at\nalleviating symptoms.\nGenerally, a cold starts with a vague\nfeeling of being unwell, sometimes accompanied by aching muscles and a headache, or\njust a'mu zz y' head. It is usual to have a fever up to 39\u00b0 at this stage. The sufferer\nthen goes on to develop a runny nose, which\nafter a couple of days becomes blocked with\nthicker white or yellow mucus.\nA cough usually starts with irritation at\nthe back of the throat, and as the sufferer's nose becomes more stuffy, the cough will\nbecome productive and 'chest y'.A sore\nthroat is a fairly frequent accompaniment of\na cold, or may arise on its own, but usually\nsettles without treatment after a few days.\nFor the relief of aches and pains and to\nreduce temperature, aspirin or paracetamol\ntablets, taken in a dose of up to two every\nfour hours, are usually effective. If a sore\nthroat is prominent, gargling with two\nsoluble aspirin, dissolved in warm water (or\nStomach\nUpsets\nMost stomach upsets are short-lived\ncomplaints, settling within a few days with\nsimple treatment, without recourse to\nmedicines. Vomiting may be due to eating\nbadly cooked or contaminated foods, to\ndrinking too much alcohol, especially on an\nempty stomach, or as part of some other\nsystemic illness.\nDiarrhoea, which is usually accompanied\nby spasmodic painful stomach cramps, often\ntemporarily relieved by going to the toilet,\nmay occur on its own, or along with\nvomiting. It is most frequently due to viral\ninfections, which may be contagious, or to\neating contaminated food or water.\nTravellers' diarrhoea is often due to\ncontamination of food and water by germs\nto which the traveller has no resistance\norange juice to disguise the taste), will ease\nthe inflammation and soreness.\nWith a runny nose, a supply of handkerchiefs is the first line of defence. If a stuffy\nnose is keeping you awake at night a steam\ninhalation will clear your nose for a short\ntime and enable you to get off to sleep\u2014fill a bowl with water just off the boil and lean\nover this, covering your head with a towel to\ntrap the steam. Breathe the steam in and out\nthrough your nose for ten minutes. A teaspoonful of vapour rub. such as Vicks.\nwill increase the inhalation's effectiveness.\nCoughing is a protective mechanism,\ndesigned to prevent the windpipe becoming\nblocked with secretions, and therefore\nsuppressing aches ty cough with cough\nmedicines is not advisable. However, should\na dry cough be very troublesome, such as\nwhen it keeps you awake at night, or\nupsets your favourite lecturer, it may be\nhelped by a steam inhalation, or cough\nmedicine can be bought, without a prescription, at a chemists.\nA cold normally gets better within seven\nto ten days, although a runny nose often\ntakes a bit longer to come back to normal. It\nis worth seeing the doctor if a fever persists\nlonger than 48 hours, or if a sore throat lasts\nmore than four days; some other infection\nmay be the cause of your symptoms. If you\nstart coughing up large quantities of green\nor yellow phlegm, of lf your cough persists\nfor more than one week after your other\nsymptoms have cleared, these may be signs\nof bronchitis and seeing the doctor would,\nagain, be worthwhile.\nAlan Swann\nRubella\n(German Measles)\nMany of you will have had German Measles\nand some may even believe that they have\nhad it several times. Others may have had it\nbut so mildly that they were unaware of it.\nRubella or German Measles is a viral disease\nwhich affects people of any age. One attack\nconfers a high degree, if not total immunity\nagainst further attacks. The importance of\nthe disease is its effect on the baby of a woman who develops it in the first fourteen\nweeks of pregnancy. The risk is high for such\na baby to be born with congenital\nmalformations of the heart, ears and eyes.\nIn many schools im munis ation against\nrubella is offered to all girls around the age\nof thirteen. Such im munis ation probably\nprovides as high a degree of immunity as\ndoes having the actual disease.\nImmunisation against rubella can be done\nin the Health Centre. A blood test can be\ndone to test for the presence of rubella\nantibodies. If these are not present the\nperson is at risk of developing the illness. All\nwomen who intend to have children are\nstrongly advised to ensure that they are\nimmune to rubella and, if they are not, to\nhave the im munis ation. Immunisation\nshould be done when a woman stands no\nchance of becoming pregnant since a baby\nconceived within three months of its\nmother'sim munis ation is at a similar risk to\na baby being born to a mother who develops\nthe disease in early pregnancy.\nWhy not attend the Health Centre now for advice on rubella im munis ation?

The fact is that one's health-in the broad World\nHealth Organisation sense of physical, mental and social\nwell-being-is to a considerable extent under one's own\ncontrol, at least in the affluent West. For example avoidance\nof excessive smoking, excessive alcohol, and excessive\neating immediately reduces drastically one's chances of ill-health and premature death. There is some evidence that\nregular exercise, a balanced diet with a high proportion of\nvegetable fibre and a relatively low proportion of saturated\n(approximately equivalent to animal) fats, and an overall\nintake which keeps one at one's 'ideal' weight, will reduce\none's chances of ill-health. Similarly, there is evidence that\nFor everyone who has survived this year at College, the\nUnion and the Health Centre have got it together to\ngive some tips on how to survive next year and the\nintervening holidays.\nleft-Dr Gillon, Health Service Director\nbelow-Jacqueline Faridian and Gay Challands\ndevelopment of a lifestyle which avoids regular stresses, and\nwhich copes with unavoidable stress so as to minimise its\neffects also promotes health and reduces ill-health. ,\nOf course a lot of illness is beyond our control, but once\nagain much of that can be dealt with perfectly well by the\nindividual independently. The large majority of coughs, colds,'\nsore throats and flu-like illnesses are caused by viruses for\nwhich by and large there are no medical treatments.\nMoreover the large majority get better on their own thanks to\nthe remarkable powers of the human body to combat them.\nFor these conditions rest and symptomatic treatment\navailable at the chemist are all that is usually necessary. In\nthe information that follows we have tried to help people sort\nout what they can reasonably expect to deal with themselves\nand when it would be more sensible to consult a doctor or\nnurse. None of this however is done in order to discourage\npeople from consulting us at the Health Centre if they don't know what to do. Every member of Imperial College is\nwelcome at the Health Centre. But we do know that many\npeople prefer to deal with problems and potential problems\non their own where they can and part of this supplement is\ndesigned to help them to do so.\nThe other part is designed to remind people of the facilities\nwe do offer at the Health Centre and to encourage readers to\nuse them if they need them.\nRaanan Gillon\nFELIX June 3,1983 Page 5\n\n"

Arid if\nyou scored over 31, that equals D. You should now have two scores of A,B,C or D. They are\nboth meant to help you understand what kind of drinker you\nare. Everybody who drinks can get into difficulties because of\ntheir drinking. In other words everybody is vulnerable to\ndrinking problems. The first quiz helped you to measure your\nvulnerability in terms of the amount you are drinking. The\nsecond quiz helped you to measure your vulnerability in terms\nof the extent to which you are dependent on drink.\nIf you scored the same letter on both quizzes, then read the\ndescription of that letter printed below. If you scored two\ndifferent letters, read both descriptions but pay particular\nattention to the higher scoring letter. Think about\nhow you can modify either the quantity you drink or the\nway you drink it, in order to reduce the higher score.\nA Non-dependent drinking\nIf you are included in this category, you have no reason for\nimmediate concern about your drinking. Remember, however,\nthat drinking behaviour is not a static phenomenon and that\nyou cannot assume with certainty that you will always be\nincluded in this category.\nB Mildly Vulnerable Drinking\nThis category comprises those people who may drink regularly\nbut whose total consumption is not likely to be very high. Some\npeople will be suffering harm themselves or causing difficulties\nfor others from time to time. Individuals in this category may\nexperience a need to drink, but this is likely to be something\nwhich happens only occasionally or which is not particularly\nstrong.\nYou should maintain a careful watch on your drinking\nbehaviour, since you have already entered the vulnerable area.\nVulnerability occurs on a sliding scale and category B drinkers\nare, therefore, at the early points of that sliding scale. Ifyou are\nincluded in this category, you should be particularly on guard\nfor any changes in your drinking behaviour which would lead\nyou further along the sliding scale of vulnerability, you should\nwatch how much and how often you drink with particular care\nand also pay attention to the way in which other people view\nyour drinking.\nC More vulnerable drinking\nIn this category are those people who drink regularly and\nfrequently. They are likely to be harming themselves or others\nand may not even realise they have problems caused by drinking The need to drink may not be recognised because regular\ndrinking prevents them from noticing it.\nYou should make a definite attempt to decrease both the\namount and frequency of your drinking, since you have entered an area of significant danger. Do not deceive yourself.\nEverybody who is included in category C is running a very high\nrisk of developing an accelerating number of drink problems.\n\u2022\u2022Dependent drinking\nIn this category are those people who cannot live easily without\nalcohol. If they stop drinking altogether or decrease their\nintake significantly, they are likely to suffer unpleasant physical\nand emotional symptoms. These can include trembling hands,\nagitation, sweating, confusion, moodiness, depression and\nhallucinations. This is altogether different from the more usual\nexperience of a hangover, which relates to a single drinking\nepisode. These individuals are certainly harming themselves\nphysically, psychologically and socially and are likely to be\ncausing suffering to other people. They will also be requiring\nincreasing doses of alcohol to be certain of achieving the same\neffects as were previously attained by smaller amounts.\nIf you are included in this category, you should seek further\nhelp.

    "content": "Cocktail of\nFantasy\nRampant\nRamblings\nOnce upon a time, long before colour telly or\nListermint, there was a little huddle of mud\nhuts, deep in the heart of fashionable stone age\nBritain (just north of Chelsea).\nAnd the leader of this village was a big butch\nlettuce farmer called Oglebong the poorly\nnamed. He was one of those men you saw\nthrowing concrete pizzas about in the\ngymnasium and jogging round Hyde Park on\ntwo fingers, you know the type.\nOglebong used to protect the village from\nmarauding tribes of insurance salesmen and\nreligious minorities, so he was very popular\nwith locals.\nBut one day an itinerant ethnic minority\ncame tramping around the village trying to sell\nclothes pegs and effigies of Margaret Thatcher.\nOglebong was duly called to perform his\nhighly diplomatic 'get thee behind me Satan'\nbit whereupon things started to hot up a bit.\nThe itinerant, realising the sales patter was\nfalling short of adequate, switched to all out\nconfrontation tactics and threatened to put a curse on the village. Oglebong's reply was\nsomewhat less verbose with the result that our\nsalesmen ended up sampling the local mud\npatch orally, some way outside the village. Not\nwishing to appear foolish she immediately\nuttered the curse '...And during the summer\nmonths, gremlins shall rise from the earth and\nthere shall be a great cacophony of sound that\nwill ruin reception of Radio One and render all\nthought impossible.' And then she vanished in a cloud of pique.\nSure enough, that summer, the gremlin rose\nfrom the ground and started putting together\nquite a passable cacophony, and try as he\nmight Oglebong just could not communicate\nwith these people.\nThen time went past, and the mud huts\nchanged to brick, and somebody invented\nListermint and colour telly s and urban scrawl\nand the whole place just got swallowed up.\nThen one day somebody decided to build a Hall of Residence, and it just so happened that\nthis Hall of Residence was over the exact spot\nwhere the village was. And it just so happened\nas they dug the foundations down, all these\ngremlins who had been having a great party for\nsome 2,000 years decided it was a good time to\nget back to work.\nSo every summer they dress up in funny\nblue boiler suits, get out their hammers and\npower drills and put together a reasonable\ncacophony. So if you ever wondered who to\nblame, blame Oglebong.\nRhyno\nThe long-awaited The Hunger (directed by\nTony Scott) has arrived in London at the same\ntime as its star, David Bowie, starts his concert\ntour. Fans unable to afford or obtain a ticket to\nthe concerts and tempted to see the film\ninstead should consider whether they want to\nsee their hero playing the cello (a tolerable\nmime) and aging to 300 in the space of a day or\ntwo.\nThe film begins with John (David Bowie) and\nMiriam (Catherine Deneuve) at a disco. They\npick up a young couple and tempt them back\nto their home, only to murder them and drink\ntheir blood. Miriam is a vampire, capable of\nliving forever (although not immortal) and\npossessed of a rather un feminine degree of\nbrute strength. She preys on humankind, not\nonly for physical sustenance, but for love. She\nis apparently able to seduce man or woman\nwith equal ease and doesn't seem to care\nwhich. She promises her loves eternal life and\neternal youth. In that, she lies, for her mate will\nonly stay young for 300 years and then a sudden and terrifying aging process takes\nplace. This is the fate of John, Miriam's present lover. Miriam is touchingly portrayed\nas a sorrowful, human individual (apart from\nthe grisly requirements of the vampire way of\nlife!) genuinely in love with John and his\npredecessors and deeply distressed at their\nfate. She tries to enlist the help of Sarah\n(Susan Sarandon) a doctor researching\npremature aging. However, she is forced to lay\nJohn to rest and hopes to console herself with\nSarah as her new mate.\nThe film is a potent cocktail of fantasy and\nnightmare, but suffers the fate of nightmares in\nthat it becomes more and more unbelievable\nuntil sanity intervenes and the horrific climax\nof the film draws grim laughs rather than\ngasps.\nDespite this, The Hunger is beautifully\nmade. The gruesome vampire scenes\nportray a fight for survival rather than\ngratuitous violence. (But why couldn't they\njust go to a blood bank and make a withdrawal?) Miriam's modern-day vampire\nchateau in New York's clean, wholesome and\nbeautiful, and yet lit to produce a feeling of\nantiquity and mystery. Touches of black\nhumour are evident too\u2014John (apparently\naged forty) goes to see the doctor, Sarah, and\nshe promises to be with him in fifteen minutes.\nHowever, taking him for a crank, she leaves\nhim alone and two hours later he has aged to\napparently ninety in her waiting room. Later,\nSarah explains the gift of a golden ankh from\nMiriam, whom she hardly knows, by saying\nthat she's European.\nAnd so to the verdict. I enjoyed The Hunger\nimmensely (but it is well known that I am fond\nof vampire stories). I think tales of vampires\ncan never have a very credible plot and this\none not only does well most of the time, but\nactually has some structure and the correct\ntwist is achieved at the end, if by rather\ncontrived means.\nWatch out for Bauhaus singing 'Bela Lugosi\nis Dead' at the beginning\u2014this group aren't exactly Bowie-clones but the connections are\nthere. And finally, I think David Bowie must be\nthe only actor to be carried out of lifts twice by\na woman in separate films. (Remember The\nMan Who Fell To Earth?).\nDiane Love\nMalaysian Kitchen\n234 Old Brompton Road, London SW5\nTel: 370 2421\nOpen: Mon-Thurs 6:00-ll:30pm; Fri and Sat\n6:00-12:00pm; Sun 12:00-2:30pm and 6:00-11:00pm. What on earth did Shakespeare mean by\n'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?'\nPerhaps the object of his affections was a princess who was always about to reign, but\nwhat about the connotations of hornets,\nhorseflies and hay fever not to mention heat\nrash and 'It's a Knockout'. Surely no harridan\ncould merit such remorseless condemnation.\nNow, if the Bard had penned 'Shall I compare thee to a deep fried wu n tun' the\nresulting image would have been clear and\nunambiguous. A delectable morsel, light and\nex huber ant in constant danger of being\ndevoured by swooping gods.\nThe junction of Old Brompton Road and\nEarls Court Road is not the likeliest location\nfor gastronomic revelations but once you have\neaten at the Malaysian Kitchen you will\nwonder what you ever saw in a hamburger.\nEat here with others, not so much for the\nsake of human variety as for the variety of\ndishes that can then be ordered. Everyone\nhas a bit of everything, one dish at a time.\nStart with Satay (\u00a32.05)\u2014tiny delicate\nskewers of meat served with a peanut sauce\ndip \u2014 cubes of cucumber and onion are\nprovided so that not a scrape of the delicious\nsauce need be wasted. Not as weighty as the\nname suggests the aforementioned Deep Fried\nWun Tun (\u00a31.95) is the other compulsive\nstarter. The light crispy covering encloses a ball of minced pork and prawns and comes\nwith a dark piquant sauce.\nChoosing the main course is agonising 'If\nonly there were enough of us to order\neverything,' only the price (\u00a34.15) wrenched\nthe eye past Asam Udang\u2014marinated fried\nprawns in tamarind sauce\u2014and Sambal\nSotong (\u00a32.65)\u2014squid in samba l sauce\u2014was\nhard to resist.\nIf the decision making gets too difficult you\ncan always opt for the 10 course meal (\u00a39.50)\nwhich gives you the opportunity to sample ten\ndifferent dishes.\nOur choice of Nonya Curry Chicken (\u00a32.85)\nand Tau U Bak\u2014Pork in Soya sauce\n(\u00a32.85)\u2014was interesting in that it illustrated\nthe similarity of Malaysian cuisine to Indian\nand Chinese food. Yet the curry was very\ndifferent from anything you might find in an\nIndian restaurant and the pork was a far'cry\nfrom the standard Chinese restaurant offering\nof un recognisable lumps of protein swilling\naround in monosodium glut o mate. Egg fried rice (\u00a31.00) and Oriental fried rice\n(\u00a31.55) were also sampled although the only\nperceivable difference between the two was\nthe 55p. As a side dish we tried Ikan Bilis (\u00a31.05)\nwhich consists of match stick sized fish fried in\na slightly sweet coating.\nFor puddings try the Ice Kachang (\u00a31.25).\nAlthough ice with syrup, red beans, grass jelly,\npineapple, corn, lychees and ice cream sounds\nmarginally less alluring that a summer's day, it\nreally is incredible. For the less adventurous\nthe mixture of kiwi fruit and mango sorbet\n(\u00a31.15) affords the only mango sorbet I have\never eaten which actually tastes like mangoes.\nIf you have ever chewed sugar cane, the\nsugar cane drink (50p) will bring back\nmemories, otherwise it will probably remind\nyou of water with sugar in it. However, the\nhouse wine at \u00a32.95 for half a litre was\nreasonable and they do cocktails (two) at\n\u00a32.45.\nYou can expect to pay between \u00a37 and \u00a310 a head for 3 courses without drinks and it's worth every penny.\nPage 4 June 3,1983 FELIX\n\n"

The\nNo. 647 w mm \u2022 ii mi iii iii Conservatives won Mech Eng\nand Mines under both systems\nwhilst the JCR (Labour) and\nSherfield/Union (Alliance)\nresults were also the same on\nboth occasions.\nWhen considering the College\nas or te single constituency the\nConservatives won under the\nfirst-past-the-post system but the\nAlliance won the STV election\nby two votes after receiving the\nbulk of Labour's second preferences when Labour were\neliminated.\nExam Students Disrupt\nWindow Cleaners\nA final examination was disrupted\non Monday afternoon when\nwindow cleaners started work on\nthe room where the exam was\nbeing held.\nHalf an hour after the start of\nthe third year Structural Chemistry paper in Chemistry Lecture\nTheatre B, two window cleaners arrived and slammed all the\nwindows shut before starting to\nclean them. According to RCSU\nAcademic Affairs Officer Brian\nStevens who was taking the\npaper, the cleaners were tapping\nagainst the windows and calling\nloudly to each other. One of the\nin vigil at or s went outside to\nremonstrate with the cleaners,\nwho left after some argument.\nThere had apparently been\ncomplaints some weeks before\nabout the windows\u2014one lecturer said that they did not look\nas if they had been washed since\nthe Old Chemistry block was\nbuilt\u2014and the department's Director of Undergraduate\nStudies, Dr Brian Levitt, had\nasked Estates to have them\ncleaned.\nJim Boucher, the Union\nAcademic Affairs Officer, told\nFELIX that he would look into\nthe matter and ask for the\ndisruption to be taken into\naccount during the marking of\nthe paper; normally if a description of this kind occurs, extra\ntime is allowed at the end of the\nexaminations, but in this case\nthe in vigil at or s finished pun crt u ally at five o 'clock.\nDr Simon Perry, the new Chairman of the Refectories Committee,\nj samples a Mooney and realises the magnitude of his task.\nFriday, June 3,1983 Free\n\n"

With\nHaptinstall opening the bowling,\nthe first ball bore a por tenuous omen, catching wicket keeper Harlow with his pants down and\ngoing for four byes.\nSome initially weak bowling\nby IC made it look like a possible\n200+ for St Thomas'. However,\nIC fought back taking the last six\nwickets for only eight runs\nleaving St Thomas' with a score\nof 157 all out off a full 40 overs.\nIC went into bat facing an\nassortment of UL U, United\nHospitals and random bowlers.\nAt first it appeared that they\nwould coast to victory with\nJarret (with a Walkman!?) and\nKelly providing the thrust of the\ninnings.\nFELIX \u2022 \u2022 MM MM BMI However, disaster struck.\nKelly and Jarret both fell and\nthe run rate dropped. The ULU\nwas now steaming in from the\nMotorway and causing havoc.\nThe other opening bowler was\nbrought back at the Cabbage\nPatch end and again caused\nhavoc. After Tear ran Bell out\nthe scene was very gloomy with\n16 runs required off two overs.\nThis be carr thirteen runs off the\nfinal over with Tear who'd by\nnow had got his eye in, on strike\n(IC were also nine w! ket s down). The first ball went for an\neasy sing k. as did the second\nball (li required off 4 balls).\nTe~ then despatched the third\nball for four\u2014the tension was\nmounting. The next two balls\nboth went for two leaving IC\nrequiring three runs to win off\nthe last ball. However IC could\nstill win with the scores tied having lost the least number of wickets.\nTear composed himself, remaining cool, hit the last ball and set\noff likewise did Heptinstall. One\nrun completed the fielder had\nthe ball in his hand, he threw\ntowards the bowlers stumps,\nwould it hit? Would Heptinstall\nmake it?

Addressed to the Union at large,\nbut clearly aimed at me in\nparticular, it concerns the\nfurious arguments the two have\nbeen disputing in the Union\nOffice lately.\n'There has been some\ndisagreement between us\nover the running of the\nUnion.

When he appointed Jonathan Miller as acting\nPresident in his absence, it was\nas plain as the nose on his face\n(his own face, not Jonathan Miller's) that this was a calculated insult to Andy.\nBut it is the last sentence of\nthe memo which is the most\nsurprising, particularly since, as\nI have said before, Stephen is\nnormally most careful in his\nchoice of words.\n'We feel that any further\nundue controversy would be\nuncalled for.'

    "content": "IWELFARE SUPPLEMENT!\n. STUDY AND\nEXAMINATION STRESS\nLearning strategies\nEveryone who has had to work for exams\nknows about this. A surprising number\nhowever seem to know little about how to\ncut down the anxieties associated with\nlearning and examinations. There are many\nuseful books available including Learn how-to study by Derek Rowntree (\u00a31.25 in the\nCollege Bookshop). A list of several other\ntitles appears at the end of this article. The\nHealth Centre also has a a leaflet with very\nbrief notes about learning and examination\nstrategies, which are summarised in what\nfollows. The first thing to realise is that there\nis reasonable evidence from psychological\nexperiments that one can only learn for\nabout five hours in every 24 hours and that\nwithin that five hours learning is made most\nefficient if it is broken up into periods of 20\nto 40 minutes with short rests in between.\nThus it is much more efficient to plan one's work on the basis of five efficient hours a day than to do nothing for weeks and then\nto start to stare at books until the dawn\nchorus kidding oneself that one is learning.\nMoreover, a lot of students fail to realise\nthat it is impossible to read all the books that\nevery lecturer recommends\u2014there simply\nisn't enough time. Thus, one of the vital\npreludes to efficient learning is efficient\nallocation of one's available time between\nthe competing subjects. Another misconception is that a book on a reading list\nnecessarily has to be read from cover to\ncover. Often it is far more efficient, from the\npoint of view of learning, to 'plunder' the\nbook in order to tackle a specific problem.\nFinally, so far as learning is concerned, short\nperiods of 'memory-jogging', the day after\none has learned something and then a week\nafter, and then a month after, and then every\nthree to six months, helps to embed\ninformation in one's long-term memory.\nExamination strategies\nIt is remarkable how many students coming\nup to finals haven't developed strategies for\ntaking examinations. People have offered\ndifferent approaches but the following is a fairly standard one.\nArrive a few minutes early. Coming in a few minutes late almost inevitably increases\none's anxiety and decreases one's efficiency.\nOpening strategies\nSpend up to 15 minutes for a three-hour\nexam preparing your answers by reading the\nquestions carefully and choosing the ones\nyou'll answer. Write yourself a timetable for\neach question and make quick notes about\nsalient facts you want to use for each. As\nyou remember more facts add them to your\nlist. Re-read the examination instructions\nand the precise wording of the quest on s you\nintend to answer.\nencourages you and the answer will\nencourage the examiner to think 'ah\u2014a good paper'. Follow with a favourite\nquestion that you hoped would appear and\nhave prepared and can answer well (again, if\nit's there).\nFinally, answer more difficult questions.\nEven if they appear difficult, you can usually\nget some marks simply by doing what you\ncan. You must always answer all the questions\nrequired. The first 50% marks for any\nquestion is much easier to obtain than the\nnext 50%.\nPlanning\nIt sometimes helps to spend a minute or two\non each question jotting down your plan for\nanswering it. This will help you organise\nyourself and show the examiner that you\nhave done so, even if you haven't finished\nthe question. Cross out with one line the\nplan when you have finished the question to\nshow that it is not part of your answer.\nStrategies if things go wrong\n1. If you run out of time, use notes, explain\nthat you ran out of time and that the notes\nindicate the points you would have gone on\nto discuss or the way you would have solved\nthe problem.\n2. Getting stuck. Allocate a short time to try\nand remember or puzzle out the answer. If at\nthe end of that time you still are stuck go\nonto the next question and alter your\ntimetable so that you make sure you answer\nthe necessary number of questions.\n3. Panic/blackout/terror. The best thing for\nthis is to anticipate it long before the exam\nand discuss it with people at the Health\nCentre who can help you to 'de sens it is e' yourself to this problem, which is usually of\nlong-standing. If it does happen in the exam\ntry and 'switch off. Close your eyes and try\nto think of something pleasant and relaxing,\nand do nothing for five minutes. Then try\nand see how you would explain the problem\nin front of you to someone who knows very\nlittle about the subject\u2014a school child for\nexample. If that doesn't work, try the\n'scribble strategy' in which you write out\nwords related to the subject which\nsometimes lead to other words...and other\nwords...and get your mind thinking again.\nIf none of this works tell the in vigil at or immediately. It is sometimes possible to be\nseen at the Health Centre and for the\nexamination to continue there after\nappropriate treatment. However, more\nimportantly, if you have had severe\nproblems with examinations previously,\ncome and discuss this at the Health Centre\nwell beforehand. All the doctors are\ninterested and a variety of ways of dealing\nwith such problems are available.\nRaanan Gillon\nA few other titles\nOpen University-Preparing to Study \u00a32.50\nThe student's guide to efficient study - D James' \u00a32.65\nHow to study effectively - Dr Chris Parsons\n\u00a31.25\nThe student's guide to success - W Fisher,\nLassie \u00a32.95\nOrder of questions\nStart with the 'gift' question- -if it's there.

Medical and\nnursing attention.\nCriteria for entry\nYou feel very ill and incapable of fending for\nyourself, and alas, there are no nearby\nparents to run home to, or a good pal in\nyour corridor to lean on\nThe doctor or nurse thinks you arc ill and\nprobably incapable of fending for yourself.\nYou require a degree of medical and\nnursing supervision and further invest iga tion. Eg: 'a bad virus' or 'running a high\ntemperature'.\nYou have something quite catching, such\nas chicken pox, and it is best for many that\nyou are not too mobile and readily\nspreading your bugs!\nIn a nutshell, you, or at least your health,\nmight be better off by being with us rather\nthan by being wherever you would otherwise\nbe.\nNaturally, we hope you need never have\nto experience the sick bay, or come\nanywhere near it! Should you however\n(unfortunately) need to come and 'stay\nwith us a while' here is an advance welcome.\nMs Sew Ee\nContraception\nIt's impossible to discuss adequately here the\nvarious methods of contraception available\nbut remember that they are available for\nthose who want them, and that confidential\nadvice can be sought at the Health Centre. A pregnancy at College would be disastrous\nfor many, but is avoidable if precautions are\nlake n. One method that has recently become\navailable is the 'morning after' pill\u2014a 'rescue' method that can be used when you\nhave failed to take precautions or when\nsomething has gone wrong with your chosen\nmethod of contraception\u2014for example if a pill is missed or a sheath has split.\nThe morning after pill is fairly effective up\nto 72 hours after intercourse. If you think\nthat you are at risk of pregnancy and you see\nus within 72 hours\u2014and that's always,\npossible\u2014we have clinics where you can be\nseen without an appointment every day\nbefore 11:00am \u2014a morning afer pill has a reasonable chance of stopping you from\nbecoming pregnant. Don't wait to see\nwhether your period comes on or not\u2014by\nthen pregnancy may have started.\nIf you want to find out more about this or\nany other method feel free to come and sec\nus before you start a sexual relationship\nrather than alter.\nAlan Swiiiin\nSprains, strains\nand RICE\nMonday morning clinics at the Health\nCentre tend to be busy with sprains and\nstrains from the weekend's sporting\nactivities. The majority of injuries we see are\nrelatively simple 'soft tissue' injuries \u2014\ninjuries to the muscles, tendons and\nligaments around joints, rather than injuries\nto the bones and joints themselves. The\nmajo'ty of these injuries will get better\ngiven time, but early, simple treatment,\nwhich can be carried out without involving\ndoctors or first aid ers, will help minimise the\ninjury, and help obtain recovery in the\nshortest possible time.\nIn soft tissue injuries some of the fibres of\nmuscles or ligaments are torn, with resulting\nbleeding and swelling as fluid leaks from\nbruised blood vessels. Early treatment is\naimed at preventing further damage, and\nminim ising bleeding and swelling of the\ninjured part, to reduce pain and speed up\nhealing. The treatment can be conveniently\n' remembered by the mnemonic RICE\u2014Rest,\n| Ice, Compression, Elevation.\nContinuing to use an injured muscle or\nligament will only increase the internal\nbruising and hence increase the damage to\nthe tissues. Resting the injured part\u2014not\ncontinuing to play on, or walk unnecessarily\non a sprained ankle will minimise the effect\nof the sprain and maximise the rate of\nrecovery. Witu\na bad sprain, it may be worth\nresting it in bed for the first 24-48 hours.\nCooling the skin overlying the injured\nt; art will lessen the pain of the injury, and by\nreducing the circulation in the area, will\nreduce the leakage of fluid from damaged\nblood vessels, and hence lessen the degree of\nswelling that would otherwise occur. The\nbest way of cooling the skin is with an ice\npack\u2014ice cubes in a plastic bag. or wrapped\nup in a towel or sock, being laid over the\ninjured area for 10-15 minutes. If ice is not\navailable, a towel soaked in cold water is\nnearly as effective. This treatment can be\nrepeated every few hours in the first day.\nCompression Wrapping a crepe bandage\naround the injury will help reduce swelling,\nand, by splinting the area will make it less\npainful and help prevent further damage. To\nbe really effective, the bandaging should\nextend some way on either side of the injury,\nto splint the muscles acting on the injured\narea\u2014an effective bandage for an injured\nankle, for example, should run from the toes\nto just below the knee.\nThe bandage should be worn for some\ntime after the injury has occurred\u2014until all\nthe swelling has subsided. It may be taken\noff at nigh;, but reapplied before getting out\nof bed in the morning\u2014when the swelling is\nat its least.\nI he fourth part of the early treatment is\ne/ cv ation v. ith injuries of the lov i 'er leg much\nof the swelling can be reduced by keeping-the injured part elevated\u2014above the level of\nthe v v. n st it possible, to allow gravity to\nassist in dispersal ol the blood and thud that\ncollects around the injury. When silting\ndown for any length of time, eg for a lecture,\nan injured ankle should always be propped\nup to prevent the accumulation ol fluid\naround the injury\nBy the third or fourth day alter the injury .\nwhen most of the acute pain and swelling\nhas subsided, the injured area should he\nexercised to prevent it stiffening up. and to\nrebuild us strength. The main aim is to put\nthe injured part through its lull range of\nmovement, but not to induce pain\u2014if an\nexercise hurts, you're doing too much too\nsoon. Start off with passive exercises\u2014where\ni he movements are done without force or\nweigh i bearing. and gradually progress to\nexercises where the movements are done\nagainst resistance. With the average ankle\ninjury it is usual to be able to start jogging\nafter one week, providing you have carried\nout the initial RICE treatment.\nAlan Swann\nFELIXI I June 3,19831 I Page7\n\n"
