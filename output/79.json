C. party led by the retiring president,\nJohn Alexander, boarded a plane for Switzerland. From Basle we went by\ntrain and bus South to A roll a, which\nis a centre for some of the classic mountaineering country of the Valais,\nThis was the beginning of the club's Alpine meet which lasted three weeks.\nWith our guide, who was engaged\nfor the first week, we climbed the\n4500 feet to the Cabane de Bert ol, one of the cl in bing huts erected by\nthe Swiss Alpine Club for the use\nof mountaineers. >Ve lived in this world of rock, snow and ice for the\nnext eight days. On clear morn ln crs the isolated Dent Blanche and Matterhorn towered proudly, crisp and\nglistening in the crystal air. In that first week we followed in the\nsteps of Maurice, our guide, who\ngave us invaluable instruction and\ntook us on a variety of rock and\nsnow climbs, the most entertaining beine; the ascent of the Bouquetins.\nPy the end we were quite sick of our\nroutine diet in the hut,- food we\nhad laboriously carried up -and\nit was very pleasant to return to\nthe rrr een freshness of the valley. Saying goodbye to our guide,\nand one of the party who had a date\nin Finland,the rest of us travelled by train across to'-'erm at t,wh i oh nestles under the famous 'latter horn. Cont. p.9. Col. 3.\nBIG HITTING IN DEVON BY OUR CRICKET CORRESPONDENT\nReaders of \"FELIX\", who also\ntake the \"Manchester Guardian\", may\nhave read already an account of the\nDevon Tour, which began: \"Among many\ntouring sides recently, one of the\nmost successful was Imperial College\nwho have Just returned from the\nMr. Whiteway of cider fame,\nI.C. scored 197-3 dec. in110 minutes, finishing with a hurricane\nstand of 70 in23 minutes between\nHearn (30 n.o.) and Kitchener\n(106 n.o. including 17 fours and\n2 sixes). Walker (28) hit the\nfamous oak tree which flourishes30 yards from the wicket. Whimple\nKITCH AND HIS MERRY MEN\nWest Country .... a feature of the\ntour was the high scoring of the\nCollege batsmen, who compiled 1,271\nruns for the loss of only 41 wickets\nat an average scoring rate of 92.7\nan hour\".\nThis amazing scoring began in the first match against the Royal\nNavy Engineering College (Plymouth),\nwhen I.C. scored 205-6 dec, including an opening partnership of\n73 by Fox (46) and Walker (35),\nand a fine 57 not out by Shepherd.\nRain then made conditions very\ndifficult for our bowlers, but six R.N.E. C. wickets were taken fee\n188 before the close.\nI.C. began disastrously against\nthe Royal Naval Barracks, losing\ntwo wickets in the first over. However they fought back to 72-5 by\nlunch, after which a sparkling stand\nof 44 in20 minutes between Weale\n(15) and l.it che ner(126) laid the\nfoundation for a declaration at\n229-8, The Barracks batsmen were\nnever happy against Bhatti (5-28)\nand were all out for122. I.C. were particularly keen\nto beat the Royal Marines, Lyranstone, as they had not done so for many years. Thanks to a complete\nrout by Dytham(3-8) and IIearn(4-12).\nthe Marines were put out for55 and\nI.C. won by six wickets,\nTn the traditional country\nmatch at Whimple, who are led by\nreplied spirited ly and reached\n167-4.\nSome more riotous hitting at\nTorquay led to an I.C. score of\n252-7 dec in, i ust over 2 hours\n(Shepherd 80, Dacies 73, Hearn 35).\nUnfortunately rain ended proceedings when Torquay had scored\n4-0.\nKen i'.'ea le(67n.o. including\nsix sixes) and V/h iddon(52 in29 minutes) were the main contributors\nto I.C.'s total of 180-4 dec. at\nBrixham. Brixham played defensively\nand could manage only 95-4 in reply\n(Cook 4-23).\nTn a fine match at Paignton,\nI.C. began at a crawl and had\nreached only 45-3 after an hours\nplay. At this moment of crises' Davies (42) and Kitchener (44)\nadded 65 in38 minutes, and the\nI.C. total of 152 was too many for Paignton, who were dismissed for106 after their opening pair had\nput on 82.\nIn the evenings the tourists relaxed their weary limbs and\nrestored their strength, either\nin the dingy pubs of Plymouth\ndock land or the old timbered\nhostel cie s of lix e ter. Even Gordon\nGreen would have admired the high\nstandard of Sport, which cul in in at i in a cordial exchange of views with\nrepresentatives of the United\nStates Navy (Most of which was\nanchored in Torbay\"1\nand the Devonshire Constabulary.\nMER8E RT WO THANKYOJ\n, I'M NOT A/\\ FR\u00a3SHMAN/^-~\nPublished by tilt FEUX BOABO, Imperial College Union, London, S.W.7.

His career is litt ered with the usual landmarks which\nmake a man fit to lead one of the\nlargest Colleges in the country, He\nwas head boy at Rutherford School,\nNewcastle, and has been President\nof R.C.S., l,C. Soccer Captain, and\na member of Council for two years.\nHe has hewn timber on a vacations!\nJob in Finland! attended Scientific Conferences in Sweden! played Soccer\nin Germany, and done one or two other\nthings in France. At one time, Jim\nwas Sports Editor of FELIX, His interests are unusually broad i in fact\nhere lies his peculiar genius, He\nnever pretends to knowledge which\nho does not possess, being the\nWorld's Worst Liferoan, and consequently, since most people are only\ntoo eager to air their ignorance,\nhe generally listens rather than\ntalks i thus he knows everything that\nis going on in the Union, and is in excellent touch with student opinion.\nEvery President of I,C. has an\narduous task. He is burdened by a huge variety of committees, with\nner hap s a meeting per day throughout\nhis reign. He must lend his Official presence to many social functions\nthroughout the University, This year\nthere ian special problem,\nThe Union showed many signs of\ndisintegration last year. Each Club\nand Society functioned as well as\nover (although not, to an old ob-server, better) but a cooperate\nUnion spirit was absent, Union meetings were disorderly shambles, end\noften not worth attending. There\nwere no Rags. From previous experience of hooligan students, the\nSenate was Justified( in its own\nview) in banning Rags. But,from our\npoint of view, it was not. Our spirit has been sapped. Our constituent\nColleges have not been united in any original and harmlessly eccentric activity since the Victoria Rising of March 1983. In another\nyear the Rag tradition will be lost for ever, and shortly after, perhaps like our present chemists, we\nshall\" voluntarily\" work on Wednesday afternoon,\nIt is an accident of time that\nJim Anderson has to face this crux\nin our affairs. If he succeeds no\nbetter than his predecessors, he\nwill fail. But he is experienced\nand informed; he prefers common\nsense to the Blue Book, and he has\nthe blessed gift of forthright honesty and sincerity which will ensure\nfor his counsels respect and attention. AS A PRESIDENT, HE CANNOT BE\nBAD. CAN HE BE GREAT?\n0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0\n0 - C0I consider the following points\nan essential guide to the student\nwho is aiming t*' derive the utmost\nbenefit from his stay at Imperial\nCollege.\n1) .

The\nsome arguments apply to Formal\nnance si by attend lng those fu notions the most immature student will soon\ndispel his fears about being tongue-tied and leaden-footed.\nThe athletic prowess of this College is legion in the University.\nIn order to achieve this position many students have indulged in Sport in midweek. Not only does\nthis midweek Sport enhance the reputation of the College, but it also\nenables the individual to maintain\na reasonable level of fitness, Unfortunately, some departments make\nit difficult for students to have\nWednesday afternoons off, but that\ndoes not prevent the more sensible\nmembers from having their Sport,\nIt is those students who remain\nchained to their benches during\nWednesday afternoon who are to be\npitied.

    "content": "TUESDAY, 4th OCTOBER 1958 FELIX5 knowledgeable for boding; some just\nwith pure lust. A Carnival is what\nyou make it. You can enjoy yourselves\nin any mood. The Authorities provide the main theme: the rest is up\nto you. Last year Mines started the\nball rolling with an all night orgy\nentitled \"BEER GARDENING\". Judging\nby the state of things the next\nmorning, beer wasn't the only thing\nthat was dug up.\nThe Cabaret (there is always\na Cabaret, though most of the parti ci pants are too drunk to care) was\na great success, being reminiscent\nof the days when Kitchener was an\nUndergraduate, and not Secretary\nof the Union. Guild's came next,\na few weeks later, with \"CAVEMEN\nCAPERS\". This was actually reported\nin the \"Evening Standard\" , who told a credulous public that a thousand\npeople were present, and that there\nwas also a fight with trifle pu dd ing. The latter was unfortunately\ntrue; the former not. R.C.S. made'\nup their collective minds not to have any rowdyism at their Carnival\n\"ALICE IN WONDERLAND\". The hall in which it was held was delightfully decorated, and if things were at rifle quiet, the true Carnival\nspirit was there (bottles of it). Many of you will remember reading about the demonstration by Lon^.\ndon students on November 5th1953, against the banning of an official rag. The Senate House, which cont-ro ls London University, took strict measures to prevent any similar occur en ce in the future, and the\nUnion Officers of I.C. organised a counter attraction at Harlington,\nour Sports Ground in Middlesex. It was felt at first by the majority\nof students that such a venture would\nend as a complete failure, but this did not prove to be the case. Those\nwho went to Harlington (and there\nwere many) enjoyed an evening which\nattained Carnival standard\u2122 Quite\napart from the lavish display of\nfireworks, there were hot dogs and\nbarbecued pig, dancing and all other\nforms of entertainment usually indulged in on such an evening. As\nLeft: Boanerges, the Guilds'\n{residential oha riot, bought\nback in the mists of time and\na regular Brighton Runner.\nEight: Dennis , theft.& S. presidential oha riot which\nconsumes big-ends faster than\nfuel.\nfar as can be ascertained, only two\npeople went to Hospital. Both re covered.\nLest you should think that\nCollege life is all beer and women,\nlet me mention some of the more serious extracurricular activities. The Dramatic Society has been hampered in no small degree during the\npast year by the loss of its stage.\nMost kindly Q.E. C. came to the rescue with the offer of their' s. The\nDramatic Society began work immediately on \"The White Sheep of the\nFamily\" which they successfully\nproduced in December. Then again,\ntowards the end of the Spring Term,\nthey put on two one-act .plays:\n\"The Proposal\" and-Anouilh's \"Ant-i gone\". These rather difficult' plays were extremely well produced and\nacted. Keep it up, Dramatic Society!\n. You may be surprised to hear\nthat FELIX fulfils several subsidiary duties, besides being the College newspaper. Last year he ran a Food Questionnaire which asked for particulars regarding food stand-ard s, times of eating, places of\neating and so on. From the results, after they had been digested by the\nStatisticians, came forth the sur-p rising fact that some people at\nthis College didn't eat at all. To\neat in London may cost a little at\nthe Savoy, but its cheap at Moonie's. Is hall not quote results, as they\nwill probably bore you; and anyway\nthey are out of date.\nWe have a newly formed Art Club\nwhich held several exhibitions last year, of which one was a general\nexhibition, and the rest by particular artists. Being a scientist mys elf, I am in no position to say\nwhether the standard was high; I judge the paintings by the feelings\nthey arouse in me. There were several nude studies.\nThe Photographic Society's Annual Exhibition was of a very\nhigh standard, although the entries\nwere fewer than they could have\nbeen. Don't be put off by the work\nof a nucleus of geniuses; you may\nbe one yourself, anyway.\nIf you've read this far, you\nmust have noticed the abundance nf\nsuperlatives like \"successful\".\nMost things this College does are\nsuccessful. To a certain extent it depends on the man at the top, but\nwithout you and your support, they\ncould not do what they manage to do.\nAnd some of you, like Ponsonby or Preuveneers there, will be well on\nthe way to the top.\nI.C. has the reputation of having the finest, and being the finest,\nin almost every field. And not only in its College activities either; which is proved by the notable\nglider record set up last May by\nFrank G. Irving, of the Aeronautics\nDepartment. Frank and Lorne Welch\nwere the first people to cross the\nChannel in a two-seater glider while airborne.' More about this remarkable personality is to be found\nelsewhere in these pages.\nThe Field Cup Race is solely for Guildsmen. Every year the five Engineering Departments in Guilds'\ncompete for a cup not much larger\nthan a hen's egg, presented by Mr.\nField for the winners of this truly remarkable race. It is run from the\nCollege to the Serpentine (and often\nin it); the winners are the first to cross this stretch of water.(q.e.d.) and there are no holds barred.\nLast year's epic consisted of\nconveying the four elements, each\nin its own bucket, along the route.\nAfter two minutes, the Entrance..\nHall of Guilds' was inches deep in the elements. A trail of twisted buckets- and blazing paraffin told of the passage of the battered Guildsmen. To the Serpentine: no boats.' The boat house keeper knew\nus too well. After twenty minutes\nwith Guildsmen throwing one-another\ninto the water, Civil Engineering\nbecame the winners. Apparently just in time, for three large Policemen\nflew down from Heaven on the crowd\nchanting \"Peace on Earth and good-will towards man\" as they arrested\nonlookers. When they had had their fill, they flew away as quickly as\nthey had come.\nla sO BL LAKE O US TOPERS AT THE \"FROSFBar\"\nfrank Irving (centre), alias the '.Tioked Warden A formerly\nthe Dreaded Dean, can be observed frater ni sing with (left\nto right) Paul Langston, Captain of I.0 \u00bb Gliding Club ,\nIan Duff , President of I.C.

Generally speaking,\nthat is. But this year, at this College, you are going to. find a number of old-timers reduced* to the\nranks.\nDuring the past year we have\nbeen tossed around from one re fec tory to another, from one Hop-base\nto another, until we're as green as\nyou are. We've been awakened by air compressors so early -for so long\nthat we hate the Diesel Cycle. And\nwe know that we're coming back to\nthe same thing for yet another year.\nWe ' re looking forward to it, just as\nyou are; perhaps more so, because\nalthough life is slightly hectic\nand unpredictable at the moment\n(even the Brown-Baggers are being\nstirred from their lethargy), we\nhave a surprisingly large number of\npleasant memories of last year at\nImperial College.\nIn other fields, however, interest was greater than ever before.\nMines was waking up to the fact that\nit had n't a mascot, whereas Guilds'\nhas boasted a1901 James and Brown\nnamed Boanerges (\"Bo\") who regular-ly competes in, and completes,the\nBrighton Run.\nMines therefore bought a Trac tion engine (Clementine) , which\nafter a vast amount of work by a few people was finally persuaded\nto move under its own power. Many\npeople feel that a pit pony would\nhave been much more appropriate.\nLater in the season R.C,S.( pronounced R.C.S.) decided to buy a1916 Dennis fire-engine. This, in view\nof the unstable nature of experiments conducted in the domain of Pure\nScience, was generally considered\nto be a good purchase, apart from\nthe fact that the engine's pump blew\nup in the 1920's, and t ne big-ends\nhave a habit of going.\nWhilst on the subject of mas-cots, we must mention Herbert, our\nPhoenix.

Much more will be\nwritten. The best thing you can do\nis to go and find out for yourself.\nFrom Hops we pass on to the subject\nof the sedate (well, at first) College Rail, Last year, due to the death of Sir Roderic Hill, there was no Commemoration Day Ball. Commemoration Day\nis an annual event, commemorating\nthe visit of King George VI to our\nCollege. An Easter Ball was held,\nhowever, last year at Claridges,\nduring the whole of one night. This\nwas a most lavish affair, including\nan impromptu and,indeed,an unwitting\nCabaret display by certain gentlemen\nwho were engaged in painting an\nadjacent lounge.\nEach one of the three Colleges\nin I.C. holds its own evening dress\nDance ( I refrain from using the\nword formal, for reasons which become obvious when one imagines the\nLeft: Mike Neale, last\nyears president of\nI.C.

Weemjpe)\nBY JOHN SCOTT SEELEY\nFor the last year the peaceful\ncalm of Imperial College has been\nshattered by the roar of the aircom pre es or and the chatter of the\npneumatic drill. The builders are\nin, and they will be staying with us\nfor several more years. Between the\nyears 1953 and 1962 the student pop-ul ation of this College will be expanded from 1500 to over 3000. To accomodate the extra numbers the College\nand Union Buildings will be added\nto, and in some cases, modified.\nIt is a vast project, involving the\nexpenditure of \u00a315 millions of pub-li c funds.\nDuring the past eighteen months\nfour preliminary projects have been\nput in hand. One has been completed:\n9 fourth storey having been added to\nthe R.S. M. and Goldsmiths' extension\nof Guilds. The architects were i. 'or-man and Dawbarn. The Union Building\n(N. side of the Beit Building, close\nto the Albert Hall) is being converted from a two-storey building of\n25,000 sq. ft. to a four-storey\nbuilding of 50,000 sq. ft. Work\nbegan in July '54 and is due to be\ncompleted in July*56. A permanent\nrefectory is already installed in the\nground floor of this building. The\narchitects are S ut cliff and Partners\nwith Sir Hubert Worthington as cons ul tant. By far the largest of the present projects is the Roderic Hill Building on. the South side of\nPrince Consort Rd., next to the Royal\nCollege of Music. The finished front\nof this bu il bing is shown in our\nillustration, from the drawing by Mr.\nFrank Weemys. This new building will give an ett increase of 81,000 sq. ft. to house the expanded departments of\nChemical Engineering and Aeronautics.\nAeronautics is due by October '56\nand Chemical Engineering by January\n'57. The architects are again Normman and Dawbarn with Sir Hubert Worthington, as consultant.\nThe large single floor Bessemer\nLab. in the R.S, M.is being converted to a three-storey building for use\nas engineering workshops and mater-i als laboratories, giving 10,000 sq.\nft. of additional space. Building\nbegan in January ' 85 and is scheduled\nfor completion for the beginning of\nthis session. The architects are\nNorman and Dawbarn.\nFor the future, plans of most\ninterest to FELIX readers will be\nthose applying to Union Buildings.\nAs a Remembrance to Sir Roderic Hill the Beit Quadrangle will be laid out\nas a semi-formal garden with grass\nlawns and York stone paths, and some\ncentral feature which may\nbe a fountain. The tennis club have\nrecieved extra courts at Harlington\nas compensation for the loss of its old courts on this site. I.C. students will welcome the proposal that,\nat long last, the Hostel ac com md dati on is to be increased. At present\nthis has not been made definite, but\nwe can hope for room for additional\n100 students.\nOn the wider plane legal difficulties have arisen in clearing ths\nImperial Institute Rd. / Prince consort Rd. site for the complete development of the College. This is a Government affair. In the debate\non Scientific and Technical Manpower\nin the House of Commons on July21 st, Mr. Brooke (Financial Secretary to\nthe Treasury)stated that; \" in order\nto overcome these legal difficulties it may be necessary for the Government to introduce enabling legislation after the Recess\"'..\nComment\nIt can be justifiably stated\nthat the progress of the Contractors\non the Union Building seems to be\nvery slow. Their job Has been difficult in that they started with\nhalf a building and have had very\nlittle room to mano ue vre to build upwards. But as a team they seem\ninferior to those across the road\nworking on the new Aeronautics and\nChemical Engineering Building.\nLet us hope there is no inferior work put in to complete the contract\nby July '56.\nThe tentative proposals, at\npresent under discussion, for the expansion of the Hostel, are that the\nwhole of the Beit and Union Buildings\nwill be given over to Union activities and student residential acc-omo dati on. General student feeling has been of this opinion for years\npast.. If this college is to continue\nto provide University level education, its residential ac como dati on must be increased at least four-fold.\nThe dreadful alternative is that\nI.C. might become a Technical\nInstitution with only its academic\nreputation left. It is the duty of\nall to ensure that this never\nhappens.\n* *\n# ****** * ' * \u2022 * * * * * * * * \u00bb * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \u00ab * * \u00ab * * * * * * * * * ******** *\n\n"

As far as we know, the layout of three (and not two) columns\nwith right hand justification( an\nO.K. word for this year) has not\nbeen used in this paper before. It probably will not be used again.\nPapers like Sennet receive a large bonus, grant, or whatever\nyou care to call it to assist them\nfinancially. We have a just pride\nin being the only un sub sidi sed Newspaper ( we repeat ; Newspaper)\nin the University of London. What\nyou read is not views censored by\nan oligarchy. The Union Officers, the Administration; in fact , the\nwhole of I.C. is part and parcel of\nFELIX.He is your forum and informant.\n\u2014 \u2014 now *l \u00bb\u00a9\u00ab\u00bbrH \u00bb*h F.R.S.1 WANTED IMMEDIATELY.\nTO BE TRAINED FOR NEXT YEAR.\nSports Editor. Production Manager.\nNews Editor. Circulation Manager.\nArtists. Salesmen.\nProduction Workers.\nApply through Rack.\nReturning to Imperial College\nafter a vacation spent far away, we\nwere surprised that two innovations\nhad come into being. Firstly, we\nare not writing in FELIX as he was\nlast term. Some will wonder whether\nthe paper is stepping backwards in the direction of SENNET. We are\ntold, however, that the loss of\nthose endearing little typing mistakes and ragged edged columns\nwill not affect the character of\nFELIX. Judge for yourself.... if you feel like writing to the\nEditor about it, don't pull any\npunches.\nThe second surprise is that\nsome University Union Official has deemed,it necessary that every\nmember of L.U. should have a spec-i al Union card which he would have\nto produce in order to gain admittance to the U.L. U. Building. The\nreason for this Gestapo-like move\nappears to be that in the past the\nfacilities have been misused by\noutsiders. At least, they s aem to\nthink that it may be outsiders, but\nregret ably there is a hooligan element in the University. However,\nafter careful consideration in the\nao pro pri ate quarter, these new\nUnion cards have been issued, and\nanybody who wants to enter must\nproduce one on demand. To the\nenquiry as to what is wrong with\nthe individual College Union cards\nthe reply is: \"The door keepers can't recognise them\". What is wrong with\nthe idea of keeping facsimiles of\nall the London Colleges1\nUnion cards\nat hand for the door keepers' reference? That might be a little cheaper than the costly business of\nprinting thousands of these identity cards. We hear that they are\nintending to print them in diff e rent colours every year. This may or\nmay not be true, but each student\nwill have his name and number. If student money is involved in the\nfinancing of this operation, it is an outrageous misdirection of\nfunds that are in great demand for much more worthwhile projects. To\nthe point that may be put forward\nthat not all colleges have their own union cards, the answer is that\nthey only might be provided with\nsome proof of their membership of\nU.L. U. This innovation smacks of a worst type of bureaucracy, we shall be requiring passports next in order to enter lectures! Every student who is issued with one of these\natrocities ought to tear it up. Worse\nregulations in the same stupid vein\nmay follow.\nooo ooo o Who is this intake of ICWA from\nCanada who sends the hardened editorial heads spinning?\nooo ooo o Rumour has it that Messrs .

CHESTER,THE\nCHAIRMAN OF THE ATHLETIC\nCLUBS COMMITTEE 1954-55\nThis year almost all clubs\nreport an increased membership,\nwhich is a favourable reflection on the athletic interests of this year's intake of Freshmen. Seven\nout of sixteen U.L. Championship\nCups have found their way into the\nImperial College Trophy cases,\nalthough this is fewer than last year, it in no way detracts from the\nfact that we have had another\nsuccessful year in the field of\nSport.\nThe Rifle Club had their most\nsuccessful year ever. The College\nteam shot in the Inter-University\nleague and won for the second time\nin three years. We won in the London\nUniversity league for the fifth successive year - practically a moh opoly. The Judo Club have also done\ngreat things and lost only one match\nin ten. They are perhaps one of the\nbest teams in the country and have\nbeaten both Oxford and Cambridge\nUniversities. The boat club reports a most\nsuccessful year, in the Winter term\nthey sometimes ran us many as twelve\neights, and this term had a record\nof four eights and one four racing\non the same day. Five pots were\ncollected by the club during the\nVinter regattas, and in the Head of\nthe River Race the Club as a whole\nimproved on last year's results, and\nthe first eight brought home the\nU.L. Head of the River Cup. This\nterm the four racing eights are all rowing extremely well and at the\nUniversity Regatta the first eight\nwon the Allom Cup and the second and\nfourth eights won in their div is ions. The first two eights are\nrowing in all the regattas between\nnow and the end of the Summer and\nthe first eight finish at Henley,\n'\n.\nVe wish them every success.\nThe Rugby Club had an average\nseason and although the U.L.15 a sides eluded the in, they were consoled by winning the U.L.7 a side\ncup for the first time. The club is to be congratulated on their initiative in organising an Easter tour\nof Cornwall, where, to say the least, they by no means disgraced them-selves.\nThe Hockey and Soccer clubs\nwere again eluded by the glitter. of silver cups although both clubs\nreport successful seasons. The\nHockey Club concluded the season\nwith a tour to Holland, where they\nlost only one match in ten.\nInternational Relations were\nagain enforced oy the Badminton\nClub's successful tour to Germany,\nafter winning the Larcome Cup for the fourth successive year.\nThe Fencing Club had a season\nin which? out of 9 matches and the\nU.L. Team Championship were won. The\nclimax was the defeat of King's College who have been undefeated in this University for a long period.\nThe Golf Team and the first Cricket XI both have excellent records and to date remain unbeaten.\nThe Cross Country Club are to\nbe congratulated on successfully\norganising the Road Relay Race, in which 30 teams competed, and this College came fourth. Both the Cross\nCountry and the Athletic teams were\nrunners-up for the Univensity Championships.\nOf the other clubs, the Boxing\nClub was reformed this year after a year's inactivity and came 4th.in the University Championship. The\nSailing Club ( the present holders\nof the Links Memorial Trophy ) have\nincreased in strength and won the\nU.L. points Championship in their new\nboat, and were unlucky not to win the\nteam Championship.\nThe squash and Table Tennis\nClubs report successful years and\nthe Lawn Tennis Club are doing well. The Swimming Club convincingly won\nthe University Polo League, losing only 2 out of 15matches, and although\nthey gained as many points as last year in the Swimming Championships,\nthey were squeezed into third place.\nAt the beginning of the year\nin my introductory speech to fresh\nfresher s,I was heard to say one\nclub was no concern of mine.\nUnconcerned by my lack of attention,\nImperial CollegeWomen's Sports\nClub have exploited their athletic talents in the field of hockey,\nnetball,badminton,squash,swimming,\n(Continued next oo lu m n.I.C.

He straightened up but flew\ninto more lift, and in the true\nspirit of a glider pilot he began\nto circle. Some tine Jaterhe found\nhimself at 15'000 feet.

Their greatest\nsuccess, however, is in the field of\nathletics, not only have they won\nthe U.L. factor cup which is a handicap event based on the number of\nclub members, but they also won the\nImperial College Challenge Cup - a very fine team effort.
