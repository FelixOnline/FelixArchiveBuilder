The most common methods are sniffing/snorting\nand smoking. Additionally, depending on your own personal\npreference for cocaine consumption (we all have one, don\u2019t\nwe?), you will experience variations of the effects felt. Crack\ncocaine (which is generally smoked) reaches the brain faster\nthan sniffed/snorted cocaine. This enables you to experience\nmuch more intense highs. However, be prepared for the equally\nintense comedown. Due to these naturally more powerful highs,\ncrack cocaine is much more addictive. The effects of smoking\ncrack have a duration of anywhere between 5-15 minutes,\nwhilst sniffing cocaine lasts 20-50 minutes. Whilst normally\nthis writer has no objection to drug use, in the case of crack\ncocaine, I draw a line. This writer does not advise trying crack\ncocaine.\nLegality\nThe good news is that cocaine is a decriminalised substance in Portugal and Colombia. So\nif you fancy taking cocaine without fear of a criminal record that\u2019s where you need to be\nheading. The bad news is that the UK is still very much stuck in the late 20th\ncentury (in the\nearly 20th\ncentury you actually could buy cocaine from shops). Cocaine is a class A drug in\nthe UK. This is the most serious classification. Being found in possession can result in a seven\nyear prison sentence and a fine.\nThings to do when you\u2019re high\nDo\n\u2022 Go to Metric.\n\u2022 Go out with friends.\nIn Metric.\n\u2022 Make sure you\u2019re\nin an environment\nyou\u2019re comfortable\nwith. (Metric)\nDon\u2019t\n\u2022 Feel peer pressured. If you\ndon\u2019t want it, don\u2019t do it!\n\u2022 Go to Fabric. The new\nanti-drug measures sound\na little too heavy handed.\n\u2022 Take in conjunction with\nother uppers. You don\u2019t\nwant that heart rate getting too high.\nWhat it does\nCocaine is a powerful energising\nstimulant. Once taken, expect to\nfeel stereotypical effects such as\nan increased heart rate, sweating,\nand dilated pupils (that\u2019s right,\nyou will feel your pupils dilate).\nCocaine acts by increasing the\nconcentration of serotonin and\ndopamine in the brain. This allows\nthe user to experience a feeling\nof lightness, confidence and alert-ness. If you see someone with all\nof the above symptoms in Metric,\nthen they\u2019re definitely having a\ngood time, and that\u2019s not because\nthey\u2019re enjoying Metric.\nSome statistics\nAccording to The Independent, \u201cabout one in 24 (4.2%)\nof people between 15 and 34 in the UK\u201d admitted taking\ncocaine in the past twelve months. This means that Britain\nhas the highest rate of cocaine use among young adults in\nEurope. With an EU average of 1.9% it\u2019s no wonder we\nvoted to leave. Europe can\u2019t even keep up adequate levels\nof cocaine use. The same report also showed that nearly\none in ten people in the UK aged from 15 to 64 had used\ncocaine at some point in their lives. So, if you\u2019re struggling\nto find friends at Imperial College to share your rampant\ncocaine habit with, you are not alone.\nCoke\nImperial College has a strict zero-tolerance policy on drugs.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug use, visit talktofrank.com\nGlossary\nRushing \u2013 Term used when experiencing increased levels\nof alertness and confidence. Used in a sentence as simply\n\u201cI\u2019m rushing\u201d.\nFiending \u2013 Used to express coming down. For example,\n\u201cNow I\u2019ve stopped rushing, I\u2019m fiending\u201d.\nGram \u2013 The common unit when buying cocaine is a gram.\nLarger weights can be bought if you\u2019re richer than the rest\nof us. Smaller weights can also be bought if you\u2019re just\nlooking for a quick hit.\nLine \u2013 Quite literally a line of cocaine. Lines come in various sizes, from 0.1 grams (normal) to half-gram lines for\nthe professionals out there.\nKey \u2013 Quite literally cocaine on a key (for example a\nhouse key). Prepared by simply inserting a key in to your\nfavourite bag of cocaine, keys are naturally smaller than\nlines. Keys are desirable due to a reduced amount of\npreparation required compared to lines.\nPrices and Mixing\nCocaine sold on the street is often mixed with absolute shite. In order to increase the amount\nthey have to sell, often dealers mix or \u2018cut\u2019 good cocaine with local anaesthetic, quinine,\nor good old fashioned sugar. Although sugar won\u2019t do you much harm up your nose, other\nchemicals will. People frequently have adverse effects, not to the cocaine, but the other crap\nin there. Be wary of this. The price for pure cocaine in London is AT LEAST \u00a310 a point (\u00a310\nfor 0.1 gram, \u00a3100 for one gram etc.). If you are interested in buying cocaine use some\ncommon sense! If the deal is too good to be true, then it probably is.\nCharlie\nThe Devil\u2019s Persil\nCoca\nColombian\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nC U L T U R E\nFriday 2 December 2016 13\nculture.felix@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/culture\nThe success of the\n#saveourculture campaign\nhas led to the reopening of\nfabric, but has an opportunity\nbeen missed to rationalise the\napproachtodrug-relatedharm\nin clubs?\nL\nast week it was\nannounced that fabric\nwould be reopening\n\u201csoon\u201d, along with\nan extensive new\nlicensing agreement.\nParticularly salient for\nstudents in London is the new\nblock on under 19s from\nentering on club nights and\nthe lifetime bans for those\nfound with drugs on them\nor attempting to purchase\ndrugs within the club. The\nrecent saga of closure,\n#saveourculture campaign,\nand reopening was triggered\nby the deaths of two 18-year-olds (in separate incidents) at\nthe club over the summer. In\nlight of this, while I\u2019m ecstatic\nthat one of London\u2019s top\ndance venues is reopening\nits doors, I can\u2019t help but feel\nthat both the club and the\ncouncil missed an opportunity\nto champion a more logical\napproach to club drug use.\nClearly everyone has agreed\nthat stopping deaths at the\nclub is the priority, but how\nmuch are the new measures\nreally going to help?\nThe club is already infamous\nfor its thorough search procedures on entry: many times\nI have experienced rather\nmore intimate touching than I\nwould like without having had\na drink bought for me. In fact,\nfabric has been commended\nby a district judge on its\nindustry-leading approach to\ndrug searches and security.\nHowever, updated measures\ninclude increased CCTV\nsurveillance and \u201cSearch\nCaptains\u201d, which apart\nfrom allowing clubbers to\nempathise with victims of the\nStasi, I doubt will have any\nimpact on drug abuse at the\nclub. Tighter prohibition will\nmerely drive drug use further\nunder the radar. Facing a\nlifetime ban if caught at the\ndoor, surely clubbers will\njust ingest the currently fashionable upper before they\nreach the end of the queue.\nIf anything, this is more likely\nto make them overdose - think\nhow many friends haven\u2019t\nmanaged to make it out after\npre-drinks. Kicking young,\ninsensible drug users out of\nclubs and onto the streets\nor into warehouses will only\nlead to more harm. Inside\na club, they can at least be\nmonitored by staff and cared\nfor until help arrives.\nDrug charity The Loop\nprovides drug testing and\nwelfare at music events, and\nwas extensively involved in\nthe licensing review process.\nIn 2013, its director Professor\nFiona Measham provided\nlower doses than MDMA.\nThis strategy would have a\ntwo-pronged effect on club\ndrugs, forcing shady dealers\nto increase the purity and\nquality of their drugs, further\nleading to less chance of\naccidental overdose.\nPolice, clubbers, and venues\nhave the same objective:\nreducing harm from drug\nuse. It\u2019s time for a logical,\nhealth-centred approach\nto this aim. Prohibition has\nfailed to stop deaths and\nwill continue to fail. The\n1994 Criminal Justice and\nPublic Order Act was created to close down illegal,\nunderground raves and\nmusic events. This led to\nthe establishment of venues\nlike fabric, which present a\nsafer environment for lovers\nof dance music to let loose.\nThe increasingly oppressive\nresponse to drug use will only\nlead to the return of illegal,\nunlicensed events, which lack\nthe staff or facilities to help\nclubbers that go too far.\nOpponents of anonymous\ndrug testing assert that it\nencourages use of dangerous illegal drugs, but let\u2019s be\nhonest and ask ourselves how\nwell the current approach is\nworking to prevent it. Findings\nby the Crime Survey of England and Wales showed that\nin 2015, ecstasy use by young\nadults had increased by 84%\nsince the year before. A more\npragmatic and compassionate approach to drug use is\nTheo Farah\n\\\\ A common\nimpurity in ecstasy\npills is PMA, which\nis fatal at much\nlower doses than\nMDMA \\\\\ndrug testing at the Warehouse\nProject in Manchester, one\nof the largest dance music\nevents in the UK. Tests are\ndone to determine the purity\nof drugs handed into amnesty\nboxes near the entrance of\nthe venue. If this strategy was\nused more widely, the results\ncould be posted in real time,\nalerting clubbers to particularly impure or dangerous\nbatches of pills. A common\nimpurity in ecstasy pills is\nPMA, which is fatal at much\nTime for a fresh approach to club drugs\n\\\\ Clearly everyone\nhas agreed that\nstopping deaths\nat the club is the\npriority, but how\nmuch are the new\nmeasures really\ngoing to help? \\\\\n\\\\ Opponents of\nanonymous drug\ntesting assert that\nit encourages\nuse of dangerous\nillegal drugs, but\nlet\u2019s be honest and\nask ourselves how\nwell the current\napproach is working\nto prevent it \\\\\nthe route to preventing harm.\nDrug testing would provide\nuseful information to users\nabout the risks associated\nwith the drugs they\u2019re taking.\nIt\u2019s hard not to compare drug\nprohibition with the failure of\nabstinence based approaches\nto pre-marital sex. It\u2019s time to\nquit the puritanical crusade\nagainst drug use and start\nsafeguarding drug users,\notherwise we\u2019ll keep losing\nyoung lives to dodgy pills.\n\\\\xxnu\n\n"

The edges\nwere puffed up in a glorious\ngolden brown, giving space\nfor the apple compote, fresh\nberries and toasted almond\nslices in the centre. I took\nmy knife and fork, cut a\nrather large section, added\na dollop of that sweet cream\nand stuffed it in my mouth\nimpatiently. Instantly I knew\nthere was no going back.\nThe batter transformed into\ntwo distinct phases that\ncomplimented one another:\nthe crispy, chewy edge and\nthe soft, fluffy insides that had\nsoaked up the sweet juices\nfrom the berries and apples.\nIt was simple, and absolutely\nE\nvenings on a\nWednesday for\nme are often spent\nalone in bed,\npropped up by a\nfew lumpy pillows\nand my loyal companion,\nNetflix. The one that just\npassed was no exemption,\nwith the addition of feeling\nbetrayed after a solid five\nhours binge-watching the\nlast episodes of The Crown,\nand left having to entertain\nmyself with my nose in the\nBS 5500:1991 (which is,\nin engineering lingo, the\nspecification for unfired fusion\nwelded pressure vessels),\nlooking for the definition of\nsome Factor C.\nTaking a break from the\n657 or so pages of ill-sized\nTimes New Roman that\nhad morphed into fuzzy\nsquiggles, I reached for my\ndinner, an unappealing bowl\nof romaine lettuce topped\nwith slices of avocado, olive\noil and seasoned with za\u2019atar.\nMy stomach rumbled in disappointment while my mind\ndrifted back to my breakfast\nearlier that morning at Where\nthe Pancakes Are.\nYes. Where the Pancakes\nAre. The name of the delightful pancake house. She takes\nup a quiet side in Flat Iron\nSquare, a newly opened\nindie street food hub away\nfrom the hustle and bustle of\nthe nearby Borough Market.\nWalking in through the glass\ndoors, shutting out the biting\ncold November winds, I was\ngreeted by a room saturated\nwith Scandinavian hygge.\nThe railway arch was cleverly\ntransformed into cosy space,\nlit up by the warm, welcoming light from the uniquely\nshaped lightbulb filaments.\nSmall indoor plants adorned\nthe wooden tables and chairs,\ncreating a simple, homely\natmosphere.\nThis was actually my second\ntime visiting. The second time\nin a week. Quite a dedication\nfor someone so absorbed in\nthe exciting events in SW7,\nsuch as snoozing over morning lectures and fiddling with\nflanges at hours past twilight.\nAnd for a food blogger\nwho had once set a golden\nrule that she never visits a\nrestaurant more than once,\nthis little place definitely held\na strong attraction for me to\nvisit again, much more than\nqueues outside The Breakfast\nClub some 100 meters away.\nThe waitress gave a friendly\nsmile and handed me the\nmenu, along with a glass and\na carafe of water. It was a\nsimple list of pancakes, the\nsavoury, the sweet, and their\nproud speciality, the Dutch\nBaby. Following my stack\nof wonderful, fluffy berries\npancake from my prior visit,\nI went for the sweet Dutch\nBaby without hesitation.\nWhile waiting for the\nmoment of birth, I spotted the\nowner, Patricia\u2019s stylish, short,\nblonde hair behind the coun-ter. I introduced myself as the\nblogger behind the photo\nof her pancakes a few days\nback, and invited her to share\nher story over coffee.\nPatricia lives a life\nsurrounded by all sorts\nof pancakes. The large,\nsteaming Dutch pancakes\nin the local pancake house\nduring her childhood in\nHolland. Living off crepes on\nthe streets of Paris as a poor\nstudent. The fluffy American\npancakes during her eight\nvarious festivals, which she\nhumorously described as her\n\u201cmilitary training\u201d.\nHer strong, determined,\ngaze from her light blue eyes\nwas softened by a motherly\naffection as she continued to\ndescribe her dreams of creating a nutritious, wholesome\ndining experience which this\nancient, universally loved\ndish fuses with modern food\ntrends. In this room, pancakes\nare not reserved for break-fast, but also for lunch, dinner,\na full meal or a decadent\nsnack.\nHer menu was not\ncomprised of your usual,\nsuperficial, artery-clogging,\nsyrup-soaked stacks, but an\nhonest menu with high-quality,\nlocal ingredients, inspiration\nfrom different cultures, and\nmost importantly, generous\nheaps of TLC. Behind it were\nsprinkles of pancake-related\nstories, happy memories serving waffles at school fairs and\nlove for her two children.\nMidway through our con-versation, my Dutch Baby\narrived on a hot, cast iron\nskillet of a cradle with a pot\nof cream, all on a wooden\ntray. The beautiful, peaceful\nChristy Lam\nyears in California as a film\nproducer, striving in the\nthen-booming independent\nfilm industry of the 90\u2019s. Now\nher own inventions in her first\nbrick-and-mortar restaurant.\nAll after a gentle nudge\nof courage, experimentation and her days serving\nthousands of pancakes at\ndelicious. Of course it didn\u2019t\nlast long.\nMy second visit was\ndefinitely not the last. My\nthird visit was on a bright\nSaturday afternoon, a mere\nten days later. This time I tried\nsomething unexpected \u2013 the\nAustralian. This was not as\npancake-y as the rest, with it\nbeing a stack of corn fritters,\nwith crushed avocado, cr\u00e8me\nfraiche, preserved lemon and\na mixed leaf salad on top.\nThe fritters were hot with a\nslightly crunchy edge, a good\nkick of saltiness and a citrusy\nhint from the lemon. The\nwhole combination was light\nand satisfying. I was tempted\nto encore the berries pancake\nfrom my first visit \u2013 two thick,\nfluffy buttermilk pancakes\nwith a sweet elderflower\nand forest berry compote,\ncream, crushed meringue and\nroasted nuts.\nThat, was where the pancakes were.\n// This was actually\nmy second time visit-ing.

So, does this TV drama do\njustice to it\u2019s weighty topic?\nT\nhis was an unusual\nshow for a number\nof reasons. The\nshow starts off\nfairly simple but\nslowly evolves into\nan intriguing drama with\ncomplexity and depth.\nThe series features Riley\nKeough as law student Christine Reade, who makes a\ndecision to become an escort\nright about the same time\nshe starts an internship at a\nlaw firm. Money is obviously\nthe primary factor, but for\nChristine specifically, it\u2019s also\nabout power. The first few\nepisodes of the series revolve\naround her managing multiple roles together and making\neverything work.\nThe show really starts to get\ngoing after all the setup has\ntaken place. You may expect\nthat a standard story where\nthe character realises the\nerror of their ways and leaves\nthe profession; however, in\nthis case, the show subverts\nthe tropes. For Christine,\nthings don\u2019t go quite as\nsmoothly as she\u2019d like and\neverything begins to slip.\nOne of her clients starts to\nget obsessively attached, and\nChristine sleeps with her boss\nonly to find out he\u2019s involved\nin shady dealings. It starts to\nbecome harder and harder\nfor her to keep the different\nparts of her lives separate\nfrom each other. The later half\nof the show revolves around\nChristine losing control and\ntrying desperately to get it\nback, leading to an engaging\nand riveting spectacle.\nThe aesthetics of the show\nare impressive, if not bleak\nand colourless. We\u2019re treated\nto a landscape environment\nconsisting of large windows,\nexpensive hotel rooms, and\nfancy restaurants, none too\ncolourful and all full of class.\nGiven that the main players\nof the show are rich business\npeople and lawyers, it\u2019s a\nperspective that makes sense.\nThere\u2019s even a brief indication\nof how small the high life\nenvironment is when Christine\naccidentally runs into her\nboss while seeing a client.\nThe choreography is well\ndone and works in conjunction with the sound to\nreally produce an interesting\nviewing experience. It all\ncomes together to really feel\nthe impact of the scene and\nthe intensity of what the characters are experiencing. For\nexample, in one scene, when\na character is jogging but\nconstantly looking back, the\nviewer is made to feel uneasy\nand worried with them.\nAnother great scene occurred\ntowards the end when Christine is masturbating alone but\nunable to get off, symbolising\nhow all her choices up to that\npoint have led her to get all\nthe money and control she\ncould want, but ultimately,\nwith no satisfaction.\nThis is a show where the\nmain character is an escort,\nso as you might imagine,\nthere are a number of explicit\nscenes. To be frank, they\nare the least interesting\nparts of the show, sometimes\ndeterring from the bigger\nstory. If you\u2019re looking for\nsoft erotica, you\u2019re going to\nbe disappointed. Personally,\nthe only reason they were\ninteresting was to see how\nthey contribute to the bigger\npicture.\nThe characters are a stimulating bunch, in that you don\u2019t\nreally care for or relate to\nany of them, even Christine.\nMost of them are\ncold and\naloof\nwhile\n\\\\ If you\u2019re looking for soft erotica,\nyou\u2019re going to be\ndisappointed \\\\\nThe sullen pout costs extra \\\\ Starz\nsome of them are downright\nruthless at times. This is in\nline with the kind of people\nand environment that\u2019s being\ndepicted, especially with the\nemphasis on the not-so-great\nparts of people. Emotions,\nor having some sort of emotional attachment, is depicted\nto us as a negative trait,\nwhere you need to be distant\nto move forward in such an\natmosphere.

Sometimes you genuinely believe\nChristine cares only to realise\nit was all a charade.

Attracting\nsomeone for sex becomes\nmore of a challenge, because\nit means not only looking\nfor someone interested in\nsomeone of your gender and\npersonality, but also someone\nwho doesn\u2019t see the disability\nas a problem, or (ugh) fetish-ise it. It can be harder to pick\npeople up in a bar or club,\nand someone with a disability\ncan quite often be ruled out\non dating websites because\nthere are so many other\npeople it would be easier to\ndate. And this is unfair.\nDisabled people often have\nto work extra hard to prove\nthemselves as sexual beings,\nexaggerating their sexuality\nand emphasising their sexual\nidentity, just to be given the\nDisabled people are not sexless\ntheir condition. This stigma\ncan come in many forms, but\none of its manifestations is in\nan inability to view disabled\npeople as sexual beings.\nIn general, the sexual\ndesires of those with disabilities tend to be overlooked\nbecause they have so many\nother things to worry about,\nand because the sexuality of\nthose with disabilities is not\nvisible or portrayed in the\nmedia. But this isn\u2019t to say\nthat they don\u2019t have the same\nurges and needs as able-bod-ied folks. And moreso, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t\nhaving great sex.\nIn the same way that we\nmake adjustments for other\nthings in our life, like leaving\ntime to commute to work, or\nputting a towel down before\nhaving sex when Aunt Flo\nis in town, depending on\nthe nature of each person\u2019s\nL\nife is hard, and finding\nour way through the\nlabyrinth of dating,\nrelationships, and sex\nis one of the hardest\nand most formidable\ntasks we face as millennials.\nOne thing that\u2019s usually a\ngiven is that we all like sex\n(unless you\u2019re asexual, which\nis totally okay, or you make\nthe choice not to have sex for\nwhatever reason (whether it\u2019s\nbecause it causes you pain\nor mental turmoil, or because\nyou believe that it is an affront\nto God), which is also totally\nokay). But when it comes to\nhunting for a potential mate\n(or mates), we often have a\nvery narrow view of who fits\ninto our dating pool.\nAnd I\u2019m not talking about\ndating someone out of\nyour league, or trying to\nbreak that racial bias that\nwe so vehemently deny. I\u2019m\nreferring to the desirability\nof people with disabilities.\nAs well as the physical or\nmental problems associated\nwith their disability, disabled\npeople also have to face\nsocial complexities, one of\nwhich is the stigmatisation of\ndisability, some changes may\nneed to be made. Sounds like\nit could be a lot of work, but\nreally this doesn\u2019t have to be\nany more of a big deal than\nremembering that Nancy isn\u2019t\ninto butt-stuff.\nI\u2019ve known people to be put\noff having sex with disabled\npeople because it can be\ncomplicated, intimidating,\nand can require forward\nplanning. Certainly for those\nhaving sex with a person with\nsevere physical disabilities for\nthe first time, there can be a\nlot of anxiety. But it needn\u2019t\nbe something to worry\nabout \u2013 it\u2019s not like anyone is\ngoing to break like delicate\nporcelain as soon as you\ntouch them (if they are likely\nto, they\u2019ll warn you), and their\npriority is probably going to\nbe for you both to get off,\nso they\u2019ll probably make the\nsame level of consideration\nas able-bodied people. It\ncan be immensely frustrating,\nwanting to experience the\nrawest of human desires with\nsomeone, but being held back\nby the way that you are per-ceived. It can be hurtful to be\nrejected for no reason other\nthan the inconvenience of a\nminor physical obstacle.\nAs a society, we need\nto break away from the\nsubconscious idea that phenomenal sex is a privilege\nof the able-bodied. The best\nexperiences often come from\nbreaking away from our\nnarrow view of who we are\nattracted to, whether that\nmeans being open to someone of a different gender,\nrace, or number of limbs.\nWe\u2019re all struggling through\nthe existential angst of our\nmodern, soulless world, so\nlet\u2019s bond over that and try\nnot to create additional barriers to having the sensational\norgasms we all deserve.\nThough we\u2019re often led to believe that having a disability automatically leads to a sexless existence\nthiscouldn\u2019tbefurtherawayfromthetruth.Throughtheveilofcomplexitiesandsocialawkwardness\nwhat often awaits is just another sexual being.\n\\\\ It can be\nfrustrating, wanting\nto experience the\nrawest of human\ndesires with\nsomeone, but being\nheld back by the\nway that you are\nperceived \\\\\n\\\\ It means not\nonly looking for\nsomeone interested\nin someone of your\ngender, but also\nsome who doesn\u2019t\nsee the disability as\na problem, or (ugh)\nfetishise it \\\\\n\\\\ The best\nexperiences often\ncome from breaking\naway from our\nnarrow view of who\nwe\u2019re attracted to \\\\\n\\\\ Their priority is\ngoing to be for both\nof you to get off,\nso they\u2019ll probably\nmake the hows and\nwhys and what-not-to-dos pretty clear\nas you go \\\\\n\\\\ One thing that\u2019s\nusually a given is\nthat we all like sex \\\\\n\n"

Loads more\ninformation about the club is\navailable on our Facebook\npage, website or just send us\nan email. We\u2019d love for you\nto come and fly with us!\nO\nn a cold\nSunday\nmorning,\neight\nmembers\nof Imperial\nCollege Gliding Club, both\nnew and experienced, set off\non an expedition to a new\nairfield. Meeting on campus\nat 6:30am was a small price\nto pay for what lay ahead.\nParham is a small, quiet\nairfield compared to our\nhome base Lasham, which is\nsurrounded by flat fields in\nall directions. Parham offers\nviews of rolling hills and the\nSouthdowns ridge: a line of\nchalk hills extending almost\n200km ending at the south\ncoast.\nWe would be flying in our\nown two-seat training glider,\na Grob 103C and a hired\nDuo Discus. These were\ntowed to Parham in their\ntrailers by our Imperial alumni\ninstructors, Tom Arscott and\nGuy Dutton.\nOnce we arrived at\nParham and rigged the\ngliders, to ensure the\nwings and tailplane were\nsecurely attached, we got\nflying! On the ridge, any\nstrong northerly wind will\nbe deflected up the hills,\nproviding rising air for gliders\nto gain altitude. Gliders can\nstay aloft for hours at a time\nby flying back and forth\nalong the ridge.\nGliding above the ridge is\nexhilarating. The continued\nsupply of energy enabled\nus to make spectacularly\nspeedy low flights, following\nthe terrain of the ridge. We\nwere all able to have at least\none hour-long flight and two\nof us were even able to fly in\nformation together for two\nhours, covering 60km on the\nridge.\nWe flew for as long as\npossible, being the last to\nland back at Parham, de-rigging our gliders just before\ndarkness. The trip was a huge\nsuccess, with both returning\nmembers of the club making\nprogress with training and\nnew members discovering the\nthrills of gliding.\nICGC has its own fleet of\nthree modern gliders: one\ntwo-seat trainer and two\nglass-fibre, high-performance,\nsingle-seat gliders. The club\nis run by the students and\norganises trips to Lasham\nevery Saturday and Sunday.\nTraining is done in the twoYachtclub\u2019sFar-Easternadventure\nF\nrom the 27th\nto 31st\nof October 2016,\nthe 10th\nChina\nCup International\nRegatta was hosted\nin Shenzhen,\nattracting over 140 teams\nfrom all over the world\nincluding Russia, the USA,\nAustralia and Germany,\namongst others. Imperial\nCollege Yacht Club (ICYC)\nsent out Team Imperial,\ncomprised of students and\nalumni from Imperial, Oxford\nand Cambridge Universities.\nThey were participating as\nthe only British boat in the\nRegatta, the first time in\nseven years a British boat has\ncompeted in the event.\nThe crew consisted of nine\nmembers, brought together\nby Bob Xu, the president\nof ICYC, and skippered by\nRobert Page, an Imperial\nalumni and a member of the\nRoyal Ocean Racing Club.\nAfter a few days practicing\ntogether as a team for the\nfirst time, the racing kicked off\nwith a day passage race from\nHong Kong to Shenzhen,\nwhere the majority of the\nracing was held.\nDespite being agonisingly\nclose to the finish, the passage race was called off due\nto the lack of wind before any\nof the First 40.7 class could\nfinish. After navigating Chinese immigration, the team\nmanaged to get to the hotel\nand got some much deserved\nrest to ready themselves for\nthe races to come.\nOver the next three days,\ncompeting with a host of\nexperienced teams, including\nprofessionals from New Zealand and Beneteau America,\nthe Imperial boat performed\nextremely well in their first\ninternational regatta and first\ntime racing together. After the\nfour days of racing, thanks\nto strong racing tactics and\nexcellent teamwork onboard\n(and despite frustration from\nchangeable conditions), Team\nImperial managed to achieve\npositions of 9th\n, 15th\n, 19th\n, 11th\nand 13th\n. This gave an impressive overall placement of 14th\nout of 25, beating Beneteau\nAsia, as well as crews from\nRussia, Canada, Germany\nand Australia amongst others.\nICYC would like to take\nthis opportunity to thank the\nItalian renewable energy firm\nChemtech Solar, especially\nits Managing Partner, Ms.\nChery Zeng, for her generous\nfunding to make this journey\npossible.\nICYC is recognised as the\nonly student-led yacht club\nin London. ICYC\u2019s next race\nwill be April 2017 in France,\nattending the EDHEC Sailing Cup (Course Croisi\u00e8re\nEDHEC), also known as\nthe biggest student sailing\nregatta in Europe. This will be\na historical entry as the last\ntime Imperial participated in\nEDHEC was back in 1980s.\nAlex Eckl and Bob Xu\n\n"

One highlight talk was on \u2018Esports and\nCompetitive gaming in the\nUK: A Summary and Future\nPossibilities\u2019. It was basically\nabout how e-sports is still a\nrelatively new \u2018thing\u2019 and how\npeople don\u2019t really treat competitive gaming in the same\nE\nsports have rapidly\nbeen gaining\npopularity recently\nand have been\nmaking a name for\nthemselves across\nthe gaming community.\nHowever, despite this spike\nin popularity, they have\nyet to be taken seriously or\nstarted building a community,\nbringing like-minded people\ntogether. An organisation\ncalled Varsity Games is\nthe first to aim at rectifying\nthis injustice and it\u2019s began\nwith an all-out DOTA 2\ntournament which took place\nlast Saturday on the 26th\nof\nNovember.\nThe tournament took place\nat the Gfinity Arena in Fulham\nBroadway with teams from\ngames between two teams,\nwith a best-two-out-of-three\ncompetition in each game,\neach competing for honour\nand glory. The winners of the\ngames would then proceed\nto the finals for a game that\nwould decide the winner of\nthe Varsity Games London\nTrophy.\nWhen I arrived at the\nvenue, I was immediately\nstruck by the professionalism and skill involved in the\nsetup. For those of you who\ndon\u2019t know, the Gfnity arena\nis located at Vue Fulham\nBroadway. The game was\nlive-streamed onto the big\nscreen and the audience\nwatched from the comfort of\ncinema seats we all know and\nlove. The teams playing had\ntheir own booths right in front\nof the screens with some of\nthe best computer setups I\u2019ve\nseen and technicians on hand\nto fix any technical issues.\nEveryone was presented with\nvideo interviews of all the\nteams, with the members sharing stories from their early\ngaming days and their teams\u2019\njourney working together.\nThe tournament got into\nfull swing with the first game\nbetween UCL and KCL. The\ntwo teams both selected\ntheir characters and the\ncountdown began to the first\ngame. Once it began, there\nwas a frenzy of spells, deaths\nand characters dodging and\nattacking wherever possible.\nThere was also live commen-tary, which only added to the\nexcitement and got everyone\nhyped. Even I was enjoying myself, in spite of never\nhaving played or watched\na game of DOTA in my life.\nThe two teams were pretty\nevenly-matched and that led\nto some intense and exciting\nviewing. Both teams won one\nway as conventional sports.\nVarsity Games restated their\naims on how they want things\nto change and help gaming\nbecome serious. Plus we got\ntreated to a free drink AND a\nhot dog! #Profit.\nThe next game was between\nImperial College and LSE.\nImperial fought bravely\nbut ultimately they lost two\nmatches and were unable to\nprogress to the finals (Never\nmind lads! You\u2019ll do better\nnext time). That meant the\nfinal was to be between KCL\nand LSE but before the match\ncould start, there was a delay\ndue to technical difficulties.\nThis was blamed on DOTA\nneeding an update that was\nexpected to come in the next\ncouple of weeks. There was\njust was enough time for me\nto drop out, queue for food,\nleave because it would take\ntoo long, and arrive for the\nstart of the first match.\nAs the final began, KCL\nwere able to dominate the\nfirst match. For the second\nmatch, LSE tried a tactic\nthat took the entire room by\nsurprise but that ultimately\npaid off, helping them win the\nsecond match. Finally the last\nmatch of the day was under-way, to decide the winner of\nthe tournament. Both teams\nstarted off on equal footing,\nbut slowly LSE were able to\ntake the lead and gain the\nupper hand, winning the\nfinal match, and in turn, the\ntournament.\nThe LSE team members\nrushed on stage, beaming\ntriumphantly. The team\nraised the trophy in unison,\nVarsity Games at Gfinity\nthus capping the first Varsity\nGames tournament. After\na final round of interviews,\nand a round of applause for\nthe organising team and the\nGfinity crew, the event was\nofficially over and everyone\ndispersed.\nAll in all, the event was\nsuccessful and well executed:\ndefinitely worth spending my\nentire Saturday on. Varsity\nGames plan to expand and\nhave more events, with a\nlarger variety of games.\nWith regards to promoting\nesports, the organising team\ndefinitely did a good job and\nI\u2019m eagerly looking forward\nto the next one.\n\\\\ The event was\nsuccessful and well\nexecuted: definitely\nworth spending\nmy entire Saturday\non \\\\\nthe four major universities\nof London, King\u2019s College\nLondon (KCL), LSE, UCL and\neven one from Imperial.\nThere was to be two major\nAn open-spaced and efficient setup, perfect for a tournament! \\\\ Shawn Briggs\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nImperial\ndoesn\u2019t need\nyour money\nAlexandre Adler explains why we\nshould fight tuition fees at Imperial\nA\nspectre is\nhaunting Imperial: the spectre of tuition\nfees. Six years\nago now, the\nconservative-led government\ntripled fees, expanding on a\npolicy started by New Labour.\nStudents around the country\nrose up in protest, but to no\navail. Since then, young Britons have depended on government loans, meaning that\nthey start their professional life\nin debt. The poorest students\nhave meagre grants, and EU\ncitizens just have to spit out the\ncash. Overseas students, some\ncoming from less affluent parts\nof the world, naturally have\nto pay two to three times the\nprice.\nOne could reasonably expect that Imperial used these\nnew revenues to enhance its\nstudent experience, or the\nvolume and quality of its re-search.\nA quick look at the college\u2019s\nown financial statement dispels this impression immedi-ately. So shall we look at the\nnumbers?\nFor the year 2014-2015, the\nlast for which such a statement\nis available as of this article\u2019s writing, Imperial posted\na \u00a3129 million surplus, or a\n13% profit, up from an \u00a385\nmillion surplus in 2014 thanks\nto the inclusion of a one-off\nResearch & Development government credit. Without it, the\nsurplus for 2015 would stand\nat a respectable \u00a382.1 mil-lion. The really funny thing is\nthat this amount exceeds the\ntotal fees paid by British and\nEU students by \u00a318 million.\nThat\u2019s right, Imperial could\noffer every one of its EU and\nBritish students a free ride and\nstill manage to have a surplus.\n(Thank god the financial statement also contains a public\nbenefit statement that includes\nthis sentence: \u201cThe College\noffers one of the most generous overall student financial\nsupport packages in the UK.\u201d)\nAlternatively, for the same\namount, it could halve the fees\npaid by overseas students. But\nCollege apparently has other\npriorities, and estimates that it\nneeds this surplus every year\nto achieve other goals.\nIf you think that this is explained by greater investment\nin research, then you may be\nslightly mistaken \u2013 the sum\nof academic staff salaries,\nsalaries from grants, and the\namount spent on research\ngrants and contracts are all\ncompletely covered by funding council grants and Imperial\u2019s research income. (In fact,\nthe difference comes in at \u00a350\nmillion of extra income.)\nNo, these surpluses are\nfunnelled into paying for Imperial\u2019s asset expansion pol-icy. Forget Nobel prizes and\nscholarships \u2013 the priority is\nreal estate. As prices in London have continued to grow,\nthe College has acquired\nmore and more buildings,\nfrom South Kensington\u2019s post\noffice (\u00a318.2 million), to postgraduate accommodation for\nits GradPad venture (\u00a398.1\nmillion), to its \u201cResearch and\nTranslation Hub\u201d (\u00a332.9 mil-lion). This brings the College\u2019s\nassets to a glorious \u00a31.4 bil-lion. That\u2019s right, Imperial is\na billionaire from real estate,\njust like that orange man you\nsee a lot in the newspaper.\nAnd just like Mr. \u201cCuckwork\nOrange\u201d (reusing one of his\nfans\u2019 favourite expressions),\nImperial also has trouble delivering good returns on in-vestments. The College has\na large endowment fund of\naround \u00a3113 million, which returned an unimpressive \u00a31.7\nmillion last year. Some of it\ncould maybe be attributed to\nthe profits being re-injected\ninto the fund (the statement\ndoesn\u2019t specify whether or not\nthis is the case), but it clearly\nis dismal when compared to\nthe performance of the largest\nfunds of the country, like Cambridge\u2019s. It is clear that a large\namount of money is immobi-lised for little purpose.\nI could go on dissecting the\nfinancial statement for quite\nsome time. But the essential\nmessage there is this: Imperial\ndoesn\u2019t need most of the fees it\ncollects to pursue its essential\nmissions. I would love to hear\nthe viewpoint of the financial\ndepartment in this paper: they\ncan probably explain all of\ntheir investment decisions as\nsound. However, that is not\nthe issue.

Played by Francesca\nAnnis and Deborah Findlay\nrespectively, the juxtaposition\nbetween the calm and uptight\nexterior of Rose and the\nscatterbrain Hazel leads to\nan opening that is nothing\nshort of hilarious, in a play\nthat is as laugh-out-loud funny\nas it is touching.\nRose, Hazel, and Hazel\u2019s\nhusband Robin \u2013 played\nby Ron Cook \u2013 are retired\nnuclear scientists, having\npreviously built and worked\ntogether at a coastal plant.\nSome months prior, the plant\ngoes into meltdown and, with\ntheir home now a threat to\ntheir lives, Hazel and Robin\nare forced to move into a\nseaside cottage outside the\nexclusion zone. It is then,\nafter decades apart, that\nRose arrives unannounced.\nDespite the pretence of\nfriendliness, it is clear neither\nwoman carries a great deal\nof affection for the other; both\ndismissive or blas\u00e9e to each\nother\u2019s jokes and anecdotes.\nWhen Robin appears on\nstage it is clear why \u2013 Rose\nis most definitely in love with\nher ex-colleague and he\nwith her. As a matter of fact,\nthey\u2019ve been having an affair\nfor years. This is by no means\na spoiler, you\u2019d have to be\nblind and deaf not to spot\nit a mile off. Which is good\nbecause, although it plays an\nimportant role in the plot, it\ndoes not serve as the performance\u2019s main dilemma \u2013 that\nis not to be spoiled.\nThe premise of three retirees\nin their late sixties chatting\nin a cottage is, on the face\nof it, rather drab. Yet what\nis presented over the course\nof two hours (no interval, so\nmake use of the lavatories\nwhile you can) is a dialogue\nand set of actions that is, right\nnow, taking place amongst\ngroups of students all over the\ncountry. Bad food is eaten,\nhome-made wine is guzzled,\ncharacters gossip, reminisce,\ntalk over one another, mutter\nsarcastic comments, disguise\nflirting with fighting, dance to\ntheir favourite song, and pour\ntheir drunk little hearts out.\nThe cottage itself even feels\nlike a student house with its\ndamaged furniture, blocked\ntoilet, and general feeling of\ndecrepitude. Far from being\ndull, were the play two hours\nof chat between Rose, Hazel\nAdam Gellatly\nand Robin, it would have no\nproblem providing a thoroughly enjoyable spectacle.\nJust underneath the surface\nof Kirkwood\u2019s witty dialogue,\nhowever, is a twist that adds\ndrama and a wonderfully\nengaging narrative to the\nplay, forcing the audience to\nreanalyse all that has come\n\\\\ The Children is a\nremarkable telling\nof how in spite of\nold age, our human\ndesires, aspirations,\nflaws, anxieties, and\nhumour differe little\nfrom when we were\nyoung \\\\\nThe Children is on at the\nJerwood Theatre (Royal Court\nTheatre) until 14th February\n2017\nTickets from \u00a310\nFrancesca Annis in The Children \\\\\nJohan Persson\nbeforehand. Once the true\nnature of events is revealed, a\nnew layer is added to each of\nthe protagonists' personality;\nthis propels the production\nfrom good to great. It is\nat this point when, despite\nfeeling inconsequential at the\nbeginning of the play, age\n\\\\ What is presented\nover the course\nof two hours is a\ndialogue and set of\nactions that is right\nnow, taking place\namongst groups of\nstudents all over the\ncountry \\\\\nis of the utmost importance.\nLines that had once appeared\nas throwaway now take on\na new level of poignancy;\nthe character development\nthat Kirkwood has employed\ncould quite easily be the subject of an essay. An explicit\nresolution to the play\u2019s central\nproblem is never reached, but\nthe combined effort of script,\ndirection, and acting provide\nenough of an insight into\nthe souls of Rose, Hazel and\nRobin that it needn\u2019t one.\nOn a technical note, the\nstaging serves to add,\nrather than distract from the\nperformances. The set leans\nat a slight angle \u2013 fitting for\nan old cottage on a hill \u2013\nalluded to only by a rolling\napple and the accumulation\nof water in one corner. The\nlighting changes subtly with\nthe passing of time, or with\nthe arrival of a car outside\nthe kitchen window. Robin\nand Hazel\u2019s cottage has\nno electricity until 10pm\neach day, and the transition\nfrom the faint glow of gas\nlamps to the bright lamps,\ncoincides perfectly with a\nreinvigoration of Rose\u2019s spirit\nduring an intimate scene\nwith Robin.\nAlthough talked about\nconstantly, no children ever\nappear during The Children.\nA child, however, can be\nheard laughing at all the\njokes and quips; not from\nthe stage, but the audience.\nThe youthful laugh from\nthe lower circle is so fitting\nto the play\u2019s underlying\nmessage, the more cynical\naudience members might\nthink she was a shill. The\nChildren is a remarkable\ntelling of how in spite of old\nage \u2013 with all its physical\nlimitations and responsibilities \u2013 our human desires,\naspirations, flaws, anxieties,\nand humour differ little from\nwhen we were young.\n\n"

The joyous end to the Rio\n2016 Olympic Games was just\nas well, considering the numerous issues and controversies in\nthe build-up, and even during\nthe Games, ranging from a\ngreen diving pool and empty\nseats to the Zika virus outbreak\nand the filthy state of Guanabara Bay, its waters containing\n\u201csuperbugs\u201d and even dead\nbodies, among a plethora of\nother nasty things.\nOn the bright side, this Olympics turned out to be a highly\nsuccessful one for Team GB.\nWith 67 medals won in total\n(27 gold, 23 silver and 17\nbronze), this was their highest\ntally since 1908, surpassing\nthe tally of 65, set right here in\nLondon four years ago. They\ncame in 2nd\nplace in the gold\nmedal standings by country, a\nplace and a single gold medal\nabove China, who were on\n26 (which is a pretty remarkable achievement, considering\none does not simply win more\nmedals than China in the Olympics unless one is the US). There\nwas joy for Imperial in this as\nwell, with Imperial alumnus\nMelanie Wilson competing in\nthe Games as well. Better yet,\nshe was part of the women\u2019s\neight that won a silver medal\nin rowing, coming from last\nplace at the halfway point to\nbeat Romania to the 1st\nrunner\nup spot right at the death. Yay\nfor Imperial!\nI do (not) apologise for seizing this opportunity to gloat\nabout an excellent Olympic\ncampaign it\u2019s been for my\nhome country, Malaysia, as\nwell. Our Olympians managed to secure five medals,\nour best ever tally at a Summer\nGames. We even managed to\nwin medals in a sport that isn\u2019t\nbadminton for only the 2nd\ntime. Yes, five medals hardly\nmatches up to Team GB\u2019s 67,\nbut for a country still waiting\nfor its 1st\nOlympic gold medal\n(which has come tantalisingly\nclose on a few occasions now\nbut still proves rather elusive),\nA mere 17 days after the conclusion of the Olympics, Rio\nde Janeiro would once again\nplay host to one of the sporting world\u2019s biggest events \u2013 the\nParalympic Games, where I will\nmake a point of congratulating\nonce again the success of Team\nGB. Their 147 medals, 67 of\nwhich were gold, put them\nfirmly in 2nd\nplace in the medals\n200m event in athletics. Once\nagain, I unapologetically use\nthis chance to gloat about\nMalaysia\u2019s achievements at\nthe Paralympics. It was, like\nthe Olympics before it, also\nMalaysia\u2019s best ever showing\nat the Paralympics \u2013 this was\nthe first time we managed to\nwin a Paralympic gold medal,\nand we won three of them (and\na bronze medal as well). Needless to say, our Paralympians\n(and Olympians, of course)\nreceived a hero\u2019s welcome\nupon their return from Brazil.\nGiven the hype of London\n2012 and the majesty of one\nof this year\u2019s most important\nsporting events in the world,\nyou would expect the Paralympics to be met with just as much\nexcitement and enthusiasm as\nthe Olympics before it. Given\nit was held in the same place\nas the able-bodied Olympics\nand that ticket sales were\nhigh, you\u2019d think that was the\ncase. With over two million\ntickets sold, you\u2019d be forgiven\nfor suggesting that the Rio\nParalympics would surpass\nBeijing 2008 as the 2nd\nmost\nattended Paralympics Games\nManaging to sell so many\ntickets is indicative of success,\nyet a dismal 12% of ticket\nsales not too long before the\nGames, supposedly due to a\nlack of interest from the locals\nand sponsors, left a lot to be\ndesired and resulted in significant budget shortfalls. The\norganisers were also unable\nto pay travel grants of up to\n$8 million to participating\nnations. Sir Philip Craven MBE,\npresident of the International\nParalympic Committee, certainly had grim words to say\nabout it: \u201cNever before in the\n56-year history of the Paralympic Games have we faced\ncircumstances like this.\u201d\nOnly after cuts had been\nannounced, and drastic measures taken, that ticket sales\nbegan to take a turn for the\nbetter. Launched by former\nLondon 2012 marketing director Greg Nugent, backed by\nrock band Coldplay and even\nreceiving a personal donation\nfrom Prince Harry, the #FillThe-Seats campaign took off. A\ncrowdfunded initiative to buy\ntickets for Brazilian children\nto watch the Paralympics, it\nwas of no small help in doing\nexactly what its name suggests.\nParalympiansachievelegendarystatusbutwho\nwastheretowitnesshistoryinthemaking?\ntable, 30 medals ahead of 3rd\nplaced Ukraine and an additional two ahead of the US in\nfourth. We at Imperial were\nonce again represented, this\ntime by Bioengineering PhD\nstudent David Henson MBE.\nThe former army captain, who\nhad previously completed a\nMasters degree in Biomedical\nEngineering here at Imperial,\nwon a bronze medal in the T42\n\\\\ Never before in\nthe 56-year history\nof the Paralympic\nGames have we\nfaced circumstances\nlike this \\\\\n\\\\ Kentaro Iemoto\nthis\u2019ll do nicely.\nin history.\nBut what went wrong?\nTicket sales soared and eventu-ally, the final figures were able\nto paper over the cracks that\nwere initially present. Again,\nit seems another case of \u2018all\u2019s\nwell that ends well\u2019. But this\nmust never happen again.\nLondon 2012, the most successful Paralympic Games ever\nin terms of ticket sales, with 2.7\nmillion sold, set the benchmark\nfor disabled sport and showcased Britain\u2019s diverse nature.\nIt left a legacy for disabled\nsport and took it to a new high.\nParalympic wheelchair racer\nAnne Wafula Strike gave an\nInterview to The Guardian,\nsaying:\n\u201cWe should be proud of\nwhat we achieved in London\nin 2012, when people started\nto look at us as fully fledged\nathletes. The world has a lot to\nlearn from 2012, they should\nask for the notes. Sport is the\nonly language everyone can\nspeak. Whether you are tall\nand a superstar like Usain\nBolt, or whether you are racing\nin a wheelchair, everyone\nunderstands.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shame that the\nimmediate successor to the\nvery Games that raised\nthe benchmark and set the\n\u201cgold-standard\u201d of disabled\nsport came so dangerously\nclose to throwing away the\nlegacy its predecessor stood\nfor. They\u2019ve had seven years\nto plan and budget for this,\nbut perhaps the strain of hosting a succession of big events:\nthe United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development\nin 2012, a Papal visit in 2013,\nthe FIFA World Cup two years\nago and now these Games,\ncoupled with the country\u2019s economic condition. Needless to\nsay, it has all taken its toll.\nMore obscure but no less sig-nificant, the Paralympic Games\nare as much a celebration of\nsport as the Olympics are. It\u2019s\na statement of empowerment\nto all the disabled persons out\nthere that even with a disabil-ity, you can still participate\nin sport. You can still dream\nof and achieve something\nbig. And most of all, you can\ninspire, motivate and empower\nothers like you to do the same.\nJust because you can\u2019t see, are\nunable to move around without\na wheelchair or suffer from an\nintellectual disability, doesn\u2019t\nmean you\u2019re anything less\nthan an extraordinary human\nbeing. This certainly applies to\nsport as well, and practicing it\nis something everyone has a\nright to. In fact, that\u2019s one of\nthe fundamental principles of\nOlympism:\n\u201cThe practice of sport is a\nhuman right. Every individual\nmust have the possibility of\npractising sport, without discrimination of any kind and\nin the Olympic spirit, which\nrequires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship,\nsolidarity and fair play.\u201d\nThe legalisation of same-sex\nmarriage in the US last year\nrepresents a major victory\nfor the LGBT community. They\nare human beings and have\nas much of a right to do just\nabout everything a heterosexual person can. If we as a\nsociety can acknowledge and\naccept the LGBT community as\nequals and for who they are,\nthen we can do the same for\nthe disabled. Having a disability is always going to create\nchallenges, and just because\nable-bodied people aren\u2019t in\nthe same boat doesn\u2019t mean\nwe should see them as inferior.\nAgain, a disability is nothing\nto be ashamed of, and having\none of any sort does not make\none any less \u2018human\u2019 in any\nway.\nAnd it is due to these reasons that the Paralympics must\nnever be seen as less important or worse still, cast aside in\nfavour of its able-bodied coun-terpart. That would be a mass\nact of discrimination against all\nthe Paralympians and disabled\nathletes out there, robbing\nthem of the chance to realise\ntheir dreams and essentially\nsending a message to the\nworld that disabled people\nmatter less. It would not only\nrepresent a huge step back for\ndisabled people, but one for\nthe entire human race as well.\nThe Paralympics in Rio, supposedly a step forward from\nthe success of London, very\nnearly turned into a step back.\nThankfully that didn\u2019t happen\nand hopefully it\u2019ll be a more\npositive story four years from\nnow in Tokyo.\nBeng Tan\n\\\\ Jonas de Carvalho\n\\\\ Kentaro Iemoto\n\n"

Find\nout in January.\nT\nhinking of\nWimbledon, visions\nof grassy courts,\nworld-ranking\ntennis pros, and\nSue Barker should\ncome to mind. So when we\ntold our runners that the next\nrace would be in Wimbledon,\nthere was a predictable\nwave of excitement. Those\nwho were savvy enough to\ndeduce we weren\u2019t tennis\nplayers, or that it wasn\u2019t July,\nmay have known there may\nnot be green grass involved,\nbut rather hills, cross country\ntrails, and grass of a browner\nshade. Mud \u2013 I\u2019m talking\nabout mud.\nThis is precisely what\nImperial College Cross\nCountry and Athletics\n(ICXCAC) faced last\nWednesday when they\nrocked up to Wimbledon\nCommon. This course is\nthe third and final London\nCollege League (LCL) of\nterm and usually brings\nabout a Marmite argument.\nSome hate it for being long,\nundulating and bramble-ridden, while others love it for\nbeing long, undulating and\nbramble-ridden. Whatever\nside we took, Imperials\u2019 30-plus runners took off into the\ndwindling sunlight with steely\ndetermination.\nThe course loop was 4.7 km\nwhere women ran one loop,\nand men ran two. Notable\nfeatures included a bottleneck\ncorner 30 metres in (causing\nproblems for those at the\nback), a giant log to hurdle\nover (great for athletics\ntraining), and an uphill slalom\nrich with brambles (as fun as\nit sounds).\nImperial women completed\ntheir race first, with Katie\nOlding, Ellie Johnstone\nand Charlotte Vanlancker\nleading us in. Imperial\nmen, meanwhile, had\nHarry Scriven, Will Jones\nand Greg Jones taking the\ntop three spots. Notable\ncongratulations go to Katie\nand Greg for currently\nranking 5th\nand 9th\nin the\nindividual women\u2019s/men\u2019s\nresults table for LCLs. Keep\nit up guys! With team\nTheultimatefangirl\u2019saccountofwomen\u2019s\neasternregionals\nO\nn the 19th\nand 20th\nof\nNovember, I\nparticipated\nin the\nWomen\u2019s\nEastern Regionals for Ultimate\nFrisbee. While I could just\nlist the outcomes of matches,\nI think it\u2019s time the sports\nsection of felix discussed what\ngoes the behind the scenes\nof an ultimate tournament \u2013\nparticularly from the lens of\nan inexperienced player.\nAs a part of Imperial\u2019s\nsecond team, dD2, I didn\u2019t\nreally have the pressure of\nwinning on my shoulders.\ndD2\u2019s main goal was to\nimprove and learn how to\nplay as a team. Although we\ndid not place so well (19th\nof\n21 teams), we were proud\nof our improvement and\ngrowth over the tournament\nweekend. While we lost all\nour games on the first day,\ndD2 managed to tie and win\ngames on the second day.\nSince Imperial\u2019s first team\n(dD1) and dD2 didn\u2019t play\nat the same time, dD2 spent\nmuch of our breaks admiring\ndD1. I think it came to a point\nwhere dD2 kept saying,\n\u201cdid you see that throw,\u201d\nor \u201cthey\u2019re so good\u201d. And\nto be honest, dD1 is good.\nI don\u2019t think the outcome of\nWomen\u2019s Regionals reflects\nthe skills of our women\u2019s first\nteam. They throw the disc\nwith some pretty impressive\nphysics, leaving me to admire\nto ability to throw discs with\nsuch grace.\ndD1 finished 6th\noverall,\nbarely missing the top four\nqualifying spots for Nationals\nafter losing to UEA and\nSussex in their games-to-go.\nWatching dD1\u2019s last games\npulled on my heartstrings;\nwhile dD1 played clinically,\nthey had a major height\ndisadvantage. This resulted\nin Sussex and UEA chucking\ndiscs into the scoring zone\nand ultimately winning the\ntie-break points.\nAlthough there was some\ndisappointment with the final\nresults, we played some fun\nultimate and had a great\ntournament. Also, dD1 beat\ntheir long-term rival team,\nCambridge so what more\ncould we ask for?\nMay Kyaw\nICdeserveLeo\u2019sOscarafterbeatingBears\nImraj Singh\nto close out the game with\ninterceptions from Henry\n\u2018Old Man\u2019 Alston, Panujum\nTaleongpony and the ever-present Jason. Special\nmention to big man Panujum\nfor being stopped on the\ntwo-yard line following a\nstampeding run down the\nfield. The Immortals closed\nout the game confidently with\nthe final score being 42-6.\nFollowing this win, the\nImmortals now lie in the\nplayoff positions for the first\ntime since the 2014 season,\nwhen they reached the\nnational semi-finals. They will\nbe looking to take another\nstep towards replicating their\nprevious playoff success in\ntwo weeks against a UEA\nteam, keen for retribution.\nF\nollowing a strong\nwin and a defensive\nshut out against\nthe UEA Pirates,\nthe Immortals were\nlooking to build\nupon their momentum and\nannounce themselves as\nserious playoff contenders.\nStanding in their way were\nthe Immortals\u2019 fierce rivals,\nRoyal Holloway.\nThe Immortals received the\nball to start, with Markus\n\u2018Donald Plump\u2019 Mohr\ncatching the deep ball\nand returning it 20 yards.\nLikely the first ever kick\nreturn from an O-Linemen\nin BUCS history. A strong\noffensive drive ensued,\nbut came to an abrupt halt\nwhen Quarterback Jason\n\u2018Poundcut\u2019 Kuilan threw an\ninterception under intense\npressure due to some\nquestionable blocks from the\nImmortals O-Line. Fortunately,\nthe defence came out firing\non all cylinders and after a\nseries of big plays, got the\nfirst score of the day with\nJonas \u2018More-muscles-thanbrains\u2019 Schwenck sacking the\nBears\u2019 QB in the endzone.\nNot wanting to be outdone\nthe Immortals Offense upped\ntheir game, scoring on the\nfollowing two drives with\npowerful and evasive runs\nfrom Jason and running back\nGuillaume \u2018Cheerleader\u2019\nFontan capping off long,\ncomposed drives. Half time\nscore: 14-0.\nThe Immortals came\nout in the second half all\nguns blazing, scoring\ntwo touchdowns in quick\nsuccession. The first coming\nfrom a Marshawn Lynchesque run from Offensive\nMVP Guillaume and the\nsecond due to a strip sack\nfrom Overall MVP Henners\n\u2018Exclusively Canine\u2019 Turner\nleading to Defensive MVP\nHarry \u20180 Picks, 0 Aves\u2019\nLawrence picking the ball up\nand scurrying to the endzone\nto extend the Immortals\u2019 lead\nto four scores. On the next\ndrive, a quick wide receiver\nscreen and a momentary\nlapse in concentration led\nto the Bears\u2019 sole score\nof the day. Shout out to\nWill \u2018Loosey\u2019 Coidan for a\ndiabolical tackle attempt,\ntaking out his own pursuing\ndefender and crushing\nany dreams of consecutive\nshutouts.

The rules are\nsimilar to hockey, but with\nshorter sticks (about a foot\nlong), meaning players must\ndive to the bottom of the pool\nto flick the weighted puck\nalong the pool floor and into\nthe goal. With IC member\nnumbers tripling compared\nto last year, it could be said\nOctopush is one of Imperial\u2019s\nfastest growing sports.\nWith the captain falling out\nof the car having arrived over\nan hour early, we made a\nkeen first impression. This was\nthe first tournament for all of\nour novices, where they put\ntheir skills to the test against\nWarwick and host Oxford\u2019s\ncounterparts, winning every\nmatch and bringing home the\nNovice Star. As Imperial\u2019s\nfirst all-novice team in several\nGreat Britain internationally\nwas never going to be easy,\nbut helped improve skills and\ntactics to fight back stronger\nnext time. Accused of removing the puck from the goal,\nwe fought our case that it was\nnot completely across the line\n(where\u2019s underwater goal-line\ntechnology when you need\nit?). Debating the intricacies\nof the rulebook in gameplay,\nwe picked a fight with the\nwrong player, who proceeded to announce he was\na qualified referee.

This\ndisability is known as being a\nwoman. Now before your wives/\ngirlfriends/assorted mistresses start\ngetting menstrual and forgetting\ntheir place, let me clarify: most\nwomen are disabled. If they\naren\u2019t disabled, then why do they\nconsistently get paid less for doing\nthe same job as a man? The reason\nfor this is that the female brain is\nscientifically proven to be smaller\nthan that of men (I know this is true\nbecause I read it in the Bible), and\nindeed they find it more difficult\nto do simple tasks because they\nare always worrying about their\nbiological clock ticking away.\nFurthermore, it has been proven\nthat these poor women, who have\nnot been told they were born with\na feminine disability, took almost\ntwice the amount of time a man\nwould taken to get the job done\nas they were too busy looking for\npotential partners and crying. Sir\nTim Hunt told me so.\nAnother disability that women\nface is the fact that they are\nmedically weaker and often find\nit difficult to fight muggers. It\nseems they are unable to use the\nmuscles in their, um, lady parts,\nin order to fight other people. I\nmean, you must be retarded if\nyou haven\u2019t realised you can just\ntrain it like any muscle. I saw this\ndocumentary called Teeth a few\nyear\u2019s ago and this woman was\nso far advanced (not evolved,\nOK thought police!) that she had\ntrained her, um, delicate flower, to\nbite on the cocks of weaker men.\nCome on ladies! If feminism is so\ngreat, why haven\u2019t you all been\ndoing this???\nI imagine the majority of my\nreaders will not have understood\nthe reference I just made to what\nis a common mental retardation\ncalled meminism among women. In\nfact this condition is infective, and\nis on it\u2019s fourth infective wave of\nthis epidemic. It leads to some even\nbelieving that they can be presi-dent, which of course we all know\nis a crazy impossibility. So please,\nfor the price of a Daily Mail, you\ncan help us finally alleviate the\nsuffering that these poor women\nfeel by allowing them to live their\ndreams of being somebody\u2019s wife.\nT\nhis week, dearest\nreaders, I want to write\nto you about a disability.\nThis is a disability that\nhas no charity, has no\nrepresentation, and has\nno-one spreading awareness. This\ndisability is known as not caring\nenough about the environment.\nNow admittedly all I have is a\ndegree in psychology from UCL,\nso it doesn\u2019t really count for much;\nhowever, this degree has given me\nthe ability to diagnose people with\nillnesses that they didn\u2019t even know\nthey had, so I think I\u2019m basically\nthe same as a science doctor.\nFrom my various experiments\nI have deduced that this illness\nprobably has something to do with\nthe brain. Of course I say experi-ments, but what I really mean is I\nsat down and thought about what\npeople sometimes do and gave a\nscary name to it. From this vague\nset of assumptions, I have also\nconcluded that it has something to\ndo with bacon somehow getting\ninto the bloodstream and causing\npeople to stop care about animals,\ntrees, and the eternal life force that\nguides us all, mother Gaia. It is\ncalled Pigirrumatoris.\nThis disability means that there\nare people among us who are\nliterally incapable of stopping\nthemselves from putting animal\nproducts into their mouth, and so\ncan\u2019t fully experience the sheer\nmajesty of tofu and vegan cheese.\nHonestly I would rather have both\nmy legs amputated and scoop my\neyeballs out with a spoon than use\none of those new five pound notes\nwith their microscopic-traceable\namounts of an animal fat byproduct WHICH IS DISGUSTING AND\nHONESTLY I NEVER EXPECTED\nMARK CAIRNEY TO BETRAY\nME LIKE THIS. Anyway, as I was\nsaying, people who don\u2019t overreact to small things like this have\nobviously got something medically\nwrong with them. How hard is it\nto empathise with a cow, I mean\nreally? If you squint hard enough\nthey even look like us, if not a\nbetter version since the consume so\nmany more whole wheat grains.\nThe treatment for this, I believe,\nis not accepting that everyone has\ndifferent opinions about animals\nand their importance, and high\ndoses of kale take on a regular\nbasis. I have a friend who was\nonce in the throes of Pigirrumatoris\nbut luckily due to my intervention\nof taking all the fun and joy from\nhis life, he can properly experience\nwhat it\u2019s like to be a normal human\nbean. I mean human being.\nIf you aren\u2019t vegan,\nyou clearly have a\nmental degeneracy\nJonathan Masters wants more\nrecognition of the disability that is\nomnivorism\nWe must protect\nwomen from trying\nto live their dreams\nMonathan Jasters reflects on the\ndifficulties that women face due\nto being the inferior sex\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nSarah Palin\n\n"

Do\nthey period dress the stage\nand cast, and risk being\nforgotten in the plethora of\nShakespeare productions?\nOr do they approach the\nplay from an entirely new\nangle knowing that, should\nthey fail, being a forgotten\nproduction would turn from\ncurse to blessing? The Royal\nShakespeare Company\u2019s\nproduction of King Lear at the\nBarbican opts for a mixture\nof the two, leading to an\nadaptation that trips over\nitself too often to fall in love\nwith it.\nDirected by Gregory\nDoran, and starring Sir\nAnthony Sher as Lear, the\nplay opens well. A minimalist set \u2013 brick wall backdrop,\nwith rising central panel\nto allow for the arrival of\ncharacters \u2013 onto which\nKing Lear and his throne\nare carried. The dispersion\nof incense from the stage,\nthe black and gold colour\npalette of the characters,\nand the beautifully subtle\nlive music create a surprising\nsense of place. And the\nsubtle changes to the set\nduring the 3 hour perfor-mance, for the most part,\nallow the imagination to\nfill in the blanks where the\nstage does not. Characters\nappear stage right to depict\na hallway leading to a great\nchamber, faint whispers\nof seagulls and waves are\nheard as Edgar and the Earl\nof Gloucester hike along the\nDover seafront, and crickets\nchirp as night falls.\nWhen the design choices\ndo not work, however, they\nfeel either clumsy or rushed.\nAnachronisms appear\nfor no reasonable artistic\nbasis: early 20th\ncentury\nleather suitcases carried\nby sword wielding dukes,\nand what is meant to be a\ncloak disguising Edgar, is\nactually just a grey hoodie.\nNowhere is the design more\npainful to behold than in\nAct 3 Scene 7 \u2013 the blinding\nof the Earl of Gloucester.\nPainful, sadly, for the wrong\nreasons. A Perspex cube\nacts as Gloucester\u2019s torture\nchamber, thus allowing the\nsmearing of blood, and\ndrawing gasps from the\nmore squeamish audience members. Granted,\nAdam Gellatly\nconveying the removal of\ntwo small organs to an entire\ntheatre is difficult, but the\naddition of the transparent box sticks out so badly\namong the regal gowns, all\nsense of horror is lost. The\nscene is made even more\nawkward when a wounded\nDuke of Cornwall goes out\nof his way to enter the cube,\nsimply so we can have more\nblood smearing. Forget\nthe acting, now you really\nknow he\u2019s hurt! The whole\nfiasco is rounded off when\ntechnical difficulties cause a\n5 minute interruption to the\nperformance, the untimely\nnature of which has clearly\ndisrupted the acting of\nOliver Johnstone as Edmond\nwhen Act 4 is allowed to\ncommence.\nDespite this hiccup, Johnstone\u2019s performance is very\ngood, particularly in Act 3\nScene 4, when Edgar has\ndescended into madness,\nand meets Lear, who is in\nturn well down the road\nto insanity. Sher\u2019s perfor-mance, although marred\nby audibility problems in\nthe opening scene \u2013 please\nstop turning your back to\nthe audience \u2013 provides the\ntwo most powerful scenes\n\\\\ Though some\nstaging decisions\nraise eyebrows\nthere\u2019s enough\ntextual content\nto satisfy avid\nShakespeare\nfans,and\nnewcomers will\nfind the narrative,\nat the very least,\nengaging \\\\\nKing Lear is on at the\nBarbican until 23rd December 2016\nTickets from \u00a310\nAntony Sher as King Lear and Graham\nTurner as Fool \\\\ Ellie Kurttz, Royal\nShakespeare Company\nin the play: Act 3 Scene 2,\nwhere in a raging storm Lear\nand his Fool are projected\nupward on a mechanical\nplatform and the old king\ncurses his ill treatment with\nan intensity to match the\nwonderful stage direction,\nand the play\u2019s final scene,\nwhere in stark contrast to\n3.2, a dying Lear caresses\nhis dead daughter, Cordelia.\nOf all the cast, however, it is\nAnthony Byrne as the Earl of\nKent who fills his role best.\nAfter banishment by Lear,\nhis return as the disguised\nCaius \u2013 bald and now with a\nGeordie accent \u2013 inhabits a\nnew character so greatly, it\nwould be no surprise if those\nunfamiliar to King Lear did\nnot recognise him until he is\nrevealed as Kent near the\nplay's end.\nThis being said, as with\nthe set design, the character\nportrayals sometimes spark\nbemusement. Edmond, the\nbastard son of Gloucester\nwho betrays his father,\nand brother, should be a\ncharacter that sparks as\nmuch disgust from the audience as Goneril or Regan.\nInstead, Paapa Essideu\u2019s\nperformance is more comic\nrelief; it works of course \u2013\nsnarky off-hand comments\nand winks to the audience\n\u2013 drawing laughs a plenty.\nSadly, the overall result is\nthat upon his killing at the\nhands of Edgar, it is impossible for one to feel joy at the\ndownfall of the script\u2019s true\nmenace.\nYet, with all the issues\nsurrounding this production,\nit is still Shakespeare, and\nthe performances are strong\nenough to hold together\nwhat is perhaps his most\ntragic of tragedies. Having\ncombined both the Quarto\nand Folio texts of the King\nLear there\u2019s enough meat\nto satisfy avid Shakespeare\nfans,and newcomers will find\nthe narrative, at the very\nleast, engaging. Upon leaving the theatre, however,\nboth parties are likely to be\nleft pondering the play\u2019s creative decisions, and not one\nof literature\u2019s saddest tales.\nT\nhe Royal Opera\nHouse\u2019s The\nNutcracker, like\nthe switching on\nof the lights on\nOxford Street,\nor the Selfridge\u2019s window\ndisplay, marks London\u2019s\ncountdown to Christmas. The\nChristmas themed ballet is\na tradition that has roots in\nImperial Russia. The ballet,\nwhich was commissioned by\nthe director of the Russian\nImperial theatres \u2013 complete\nwith score from Pyotr Ilyich\nTchaikovsky, story by Marius\nPetipa (who based it on a\nE.T.A Hoffman fairytale), and\nchoreography by Lev Ivanov\n\u2013 was first performed in 1892\nat the Mariinsky Theatre in\nSt Petersburg. At the time, it\nreceived negative reviews,\nbut since then, countless\nadaptations around the world\nhave ensured its place as\none of the most well known,\nand most beloved ballets.\nThe score and the story are\nso ubiquitous in Western art,\nand music, that the chances\nare you will have heard bars\nof The Dance of Sugarplum\nFairy, even if you\u2019re not able\nto name it as such.\nThe ballet follows the story\nof Clara, a young girl who\nsneaks out of bed one night\nto play with her new toy,\nthe Nutcracker, only to be\ntransported to a wonderland\nby the travelling magician,\nDrosselmeyer. In this Kingdom\nof Sweets, she battles a\nmouse army, witnesses the\nNutcracker transform into\nthe Prince, and travels to the\npalace, where she is greeted\nby Sugar Plum Fairy and her\ncourt. Over 400 performances have taken place\nat the Royal Opera House\nalone. The present ROH\nadaptation is choreographed\nby Peter Wright, who first\nadapted the ballet in the\n1980s for the Royal Ballet. His\nrevision turned back decades\nof tweaks; Wright collaborated with a musicologist\nRoland John Wiley, to bring a\nversion to the stage that was\nas faithful to the 19th\ncentury\noriginal as possible.\nThe Wright version, performed by the Royal Ballet,\nhas been recorded and\ntelevised numerous times, and\nhas thus set a standard by\nwhich all other performances\nare danced. None of this century\u2019s worth of stifling history\nseems to sit heavily on the\ndancers' shoulders, each of\nwhom dance with abandon in\ntheir performance. Franscesca\nHayward, as Clara pitches\nIndira Mallik\nThe Nutcracker is on at the Royal\nOpera House until 12th January\n2017\n.\nTickets from \u00a360\nSteven McRae as The Prince and Iana\nSalenko as the Sugar Plum Fairy in The\nNutcracker \\\\ \u00a9 2015 ROH | Photograph\nby Tristram Kenton\nthe performance of a young\ngirl just right \u2013vulnerable,\nwondering, but with plenty of\npluck; she is quick-footed and\nteasing as she shows off her\nnew toy to her brother in the\nopening scenes, bold as she\nbrings down the Mouse King\nwith a well aimed strike of\na heel. When Drosselmayer\n\\\\ None of this\ncentury\u2019s worth\nof stifling history\nseems to sit heavily\non the dancer\u2019s\nshoulders, each of\nwhom dance with\nabandon in their\nperformance \\\\\ncasts his spell to whisk her\naway to the Kingdom of\nSweets, she truly seems to\nshrink down, Alice-like, as\nthe Christmas tree behind her\ngrows, and grows \u2013 filling the\nentire height of the cavernous\nRoyal Opera House.\nOn the night I saw the\nperformance, as the Sugar\nPlum Fairy and her prince\nrespectively, Lauren Cuthbertson and Federico Bonelli\ndanced to thunderous rounds\n\\\\ Glitter and gilt\nabound, this is a\nlight and frothy\nproduction \u2013 a\nfitting celebration of\nPeter Wright's 90th\nbirthday \\\\\nof applause. Cuthbertson was\ninundated with bouquets of\nflowers as she took her bows,\ndeservedly so: at points she\nseemed to fly, leaping and\npirouetting across the stage\nin a show of breathtaking\nathleticism and skill. Bonelli\nwas never quite able to\nreach Cuthbertson\u2019s virtuoso\nheights, but partnered her\nadmirably, highlighting his\nown talent in his solo piece.\nFrom my perch in the upper\namphitheatre, the artifice of\nthe stage below was appar-ent, but this did nothing to\nhamper the charm. Rather the\naction seemed to take place\nin a gigantic doll\u2019s house,\nrather like the doll\u2019s house\nwith which Clara plays in the\nopening scenes of the pro-duction. The set whirled and\ntransfigured itself; cosy rooms\nmelted into snow filled town\nsquares, only to be replaced\nby wintry fields, giving way\nto sumptuous palaces. Julia\nTrevelyan Oman\u2019s beautifully\ncrafted set design borrows\nfrom the look of the 19th\ncentury Imperial Russia; glitter,\nand gilt abound. The Kingdom of Sweets seems entirely\nbuilt entirely from spun sugar.\nThis is a light, frothy produc-tion, the two hours fly by - I\nleft the theatre in a state of\nchildlike wonder, thoroughly\nin the Christmas mood.\nThere is no subversion, no\nnew edgy angle, the Royal\nBallet and Wright have\nchosen not to reinvent the\nwheel; wisely so. The Nutcracker is deeply traditional,\nperformed and staged with\nexcellence: happily, it wears\nnone of the weariness that\nwe might expect from such\na long running production.\nPeter Wright\u2019s 90th\nbirthday fell during this run, this\nyear\u2019s production is a fitting\ncelebration and tribute to the\none-of-a-kind dancer, and\nartistic director.\nThe\nNutcracker |\nLondon's\nChristmas\ncountdown has\nbegun\n\n"

We thought\npreliminary fundraising would\nbe a good opportunity to\ntest the waters, and to get a\nheadstart on raising money\nfor our charities... We noticed\nhow few people carried cash\non them \u2013 because of this\nwe set up a separate online\ndonation page for the day of\nJailbreak. Using technology\nwas an effective solution, and\nwe raised \u00a3200 from here.\u201d\nOn the day of Jailbreak,\nBrownian Motion hit the busy\nLondon streets and managed\nto raise \u00a3700. This allowed\nthem to book flights to Dubai\nonly to almost immediately\ncancel the tickets to buy flights\nto Bali, a good 7,000 km\nfurther away yet still within\nbudget (return costs were\ncovered by the Jailbreaking\nteams). Almost 24 hours later,\nBrownian Motion checked\nthemselves in a luxurious four\nstar hotel, having broken the\nprevious Singapore record.\nBut Brownian Motion weren\u2019t\nthe only team to achieve\nimpressive distances this year.\nOver half the participating\nteams reached the 1,000 km\nmark, and over a quarter of\nthe teams surpassed the 2,000\nkm mark.\nIn not so close but equally\nastonishing second place,\nrip harambe travelled\nan impressive 4,515 km,\nmanaging to reach Gambia\nin the process. Team rip\nharambe, consisting of first\nyear medic Benjamin Jones\nand his climbing partner,\nsecond year Southampton\ncomputing student Samuel\nLaw, achieved their mission\nby identifying the destination\nwith the best distance to price\nratio the night before. (\u201cOur\ndreams of Kazakhstan were\ndashed by a long stopover in\nMoscow\u201d).\n2016\u2019s Jailbreak challenge\nwent a lot smoother this time\nround. Last year, one of IC\nRAG\u2019s Jailbreak teams got\npulled off a flight to Turkey\nafter terror suspicions (it\nwas all a misunderstanding).\nDespite the lack of drama this\nyear, there were still surprises.\n\u201cI spent \u00a336 on 3G sending a\nSnapchat, which was fun\u201d, says\nJones of team rip harambe,\nwho we hope will think twice\nnext time he enables data\nroaming in Gambia.\nThough Jailbreak is often\ncriticised when donation\nmoney is spent on travelling\nexpenses, teams are expected\nto pay for their journeys back\nand they usually also acquire\nsponsorship per mile travelled,\nso in the end, despite travel\ncosts, the fundraiser yields\nsignificant proceeds. RAG\nchair, Cynfelyn NancarrowLei, said \u201c [We tried] to create\n\\\\ Our dreams\nof Kazakhstan\nwere dashed by a\nlong stopover in\nMoscow \\\\\na per-mile sponsorship form\nprior to the Jailbreak, so that\nyou raise more for Charity\nafter the Jailbreak (when you\nknow how many miles you\nhave travelled) than you do\nfor flights during the event.\nI really pushed that this year\nin the presentation I gave and\nin emails and social media.\nUnfortunately the winning\nteam didn\u2019t adopt this method.\nIf they did they could be\nraising a hell of a lot more.\nMost other teams will however\ndid take our advice.\u201d\nThe top two teams (distance-wise), Brownian Motion\nand rip harambe, have so\nfar raised \u00a3355 and \u00a3435\nrespectively. In total this year\u2019s\njailbreak has raised \u00a310,000\nso far but is expecting to\nraise somewhere between\n\u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000 by\nthe end of term.

In\nthe meantime the Union, in\nconjunction with College,\nwill locate an appropriate\nspace for members of Islamic\nSociety to pray, which takes\ninto consideration the club\u2019s\nneeds such as proximity to\nwashroom facilities.

We were told\nthen that we might be moving\nout of the room soon, so we\nshould wait and see what\nhappens.

There\u2019s\nno better rule.\" It is\nkeenly observed by Christian\nBurgess who delivers a no\nfrills production of Great\nExpectations superbly carried\nby convincing performances\nand slick directing.\nGreat Expectations is Dicken\u2019s penultimate novel and\nperhaps his most assured; by\n1860 Dickens had acquired\nconsiderable life experience\n\u2013 he had separated from his\nwife Catherine Dickens, and\nwas concealing a surreptitious affair with the much\nyounger Ellen Ternan \u2013 this is\nchannelled into the capricious\naffairs of young Pip along his\njourney toward adulthood.\nMany of the novel\u2019s themes\nreflect the Victorian Britain in\nwhich it is set: social injustice,\npoverty, a gothic depiction\nof the waning aristocracy.\nOthers are timeless characteristics of the bildungsroman:\nunrequited love, disenfranchised youth, pride,\nignorance, and catharsis.\nBurgess tactfully navigates\nthese themes to give a balanced performance. For those\nwho know the novel well,\nthere is admirable continuity.\nThe dialogue is lifted directly\nfrom the text and the sparse\nset design leaves the imagination to conjure up the story\u2019s\nmany vivid settings,\nfirmly ingrained in our\nsubconscious from\nthe descriptions in\nthe book. A general atmosphere\nof foreboding is\nmaintained by\nAndy Taylor\u2019s\ndroning orchestral score and\nthe troop of\nactors who,\nwhen not per-forming, stand\nautomaton-like\non stage, mirroring\nPip\u2019s reactions to the\nunfolding drama.\nThis quirk is used\neffectively to narrate the\nplay; the same actors deliver\nPip\u2019s inner monologue as we\nmove from scene to scene.\nThis gives an impetus to the\nplot and paces the performance excellently, the entire\nperformance is no more than\ntwo hours yet covers most of\nthe intricacies in the novel.\nEzra Kitson\nOne disappointing omission\nare the scenes at Wemmick\u2019s\ncastle, and the development\nof Wemmick\u2019s eccentricity is\nlargely neglected throughout\nthe play, but given the constraints of time this is justified.\nDuring the performance,\nonce again, I was reminded\nof why Guildhall is considered\na world leading conserva-toire. The calibre of talent\nwas very high: Luke Thallon\u2019s\nportrayal of Mr. Jagger was\n\\\\ Christian Burgess\nwho delivers a no\nfrills production of\nGreat Expectations\nsuperbly carried\nby convincing\nperformances and\nslick directing \\\\\nAnya Chalotra as Miss Havisham \\\\\nGuildhall School | Clive Barda 2016\nsuperbly imperious and\nundemonstrative. It is rare\nthat after reading a novel,\nour perception of a character\nis improved by another\u2019s\ninterpretation: this was a first\nfor me, and I look forward\nto seeing how the career of\nthis young actor progresses.\nAlso notable were Rupert\nHenderson and Amelia\nStrohm, who played Pip and\nEstella respectively. In many\nways the complexities of the\nplot hang on the relationship\nbetween these two charac-ters, and the actors bore the\nweight of this burden admira-bly. Pip\u2019s transformation from\na blacksmith\u2019s apprentice to\na besotted gentleman was\nachieved seamlessly, his\nperformance confident and\nfunny throughout. Estella was\nplayed with a solemnity and\nnobleness that reminded me\nof the woman with \u2018beauty\nlike a drawn bow\u2019 that Yeats\ndescribes in No Second Troy.\nTheir relationship was con-vincing, tragic and provided\na firm foundation for the rest\nof the actors to work from.\nWhen Dickens first conceived the plot of Great\nExpectations, he called\nit \u2018a very fine, new and\ngrotesque idea\u2019. The more I\nreview shows, I am starting\nto recognise that successful\ndramas share aspects in\ncommon. Great Expectations may be grotesque,\nand it certainly is fine, but\nit is not entirely new; the\nfundamental principles\nupon which good plot,\ncharacter and story\nare based on never\nchange. According\nto E.M Forster:\n\u201cThe final test of a\nnovel will be our\naffection for it, as it\nis of anything which\nwe cannot define.\u201d\nThe care put into\na performance like\nthis demonstrates why\nGreat Expectations\ndeserves its reputation\nas a classic.\nRupert Henderson as Pip, and Amelia Strohm as Estella \\\\ Guildhall School |\nClive Barda 2016\nD\nespite the\npre-existing\nManon by\nJules Massenet,\nPuccini chose to\nwrite another\nopera based on the story of\nManon Lescaut, defending\nhis decision thus: \u201ca woman\nlike Manon can have\nmore than one lover.\u201d The\nsentiment is not untrue; by\nturns passionate, coquettish,\nand mercenary, Manon is\na character who captivates\nboth the audience and her\nfellow protagonists on stage.\nManon begins the opera\nas an unsuspecting ing\u00e9nue\nof striking beauty. In keeping\nwith the long tradition of\nbadly treating women like\nher, she is desired, and\nexploited. Her father sends\nher to a convent; her brother\nhappily sells her off to the old\nlecher Geronte. Geronte, on\nhis part, tries to abduct her\nby force but she escapes with\nDes Grieux, the student she\nhas just met and fallen in love\nwith.\nUnlike most other na\u00efve her-oines, however, Manon is not\njust a helpless character at the\nmercy of circumstance. She\nwants to have it all, though\nthis eventually leads to her\nundoing. Act II finds her the\nlavishly kept mistress of Geronte rather than the devoted\nwife of Des Grieux. When\nDes Grieux comes to find her,\nManon wants to flee with him,\nbut cannot quite tear herself\naway from her jewels, leading to their fatal delay and\narrest. She is deported\nwith other prostitutes\n(the devoted Des\nGrieux follows her)\nand dies of thirst\n\u201cin the Louisiana\ndesert\u201d.\nModernised\nproductions seem\nto be in fashion\nthis season: director Kasper Holten\u2019s\nManon Lescaut is set\ntwo centuries forward\nin contemporary Paris.\nHaving watched the modern\nproductions of Cymbeline\n(delightful) and Oreste (ter-rible), I\u2019m not actually sure\nwhere Manon Lescaut falls on\nthe spectrum. The sets were\nindividually stunning \u2013 a crystal cage with garishly pink\ntrimmings for Act II, a bro-ken-off highway to nowhere\nfor the final scenes \u2013 but\n\\\\ Sondra\nRadvanovsky\nmanaged to bring\nout the complexity\nof the character,\nwith her voice\nalternating to\nevoke both the\nlighthearted\ncoquette and the\ndesolate fallen\nwoman \\\\\nManon Lescaut\nraises some\nquestions\nClaire Chan\nManon Lescaut is on at the Royal\nOpera House until 12th December 2016\nTickets from \u00a313\nKrist\u012bne Opolais as Manon Lescaut in\nManon Lescaut \\\\ The Royal Opera\n\u00a9 ROH | Bill Cooper 2014\ndidn\u2019t really come together\nto tell a coherent story.

What is the\npoint\n\\\\ Antonio\nPappano is an\nexperienced\nconductor of\nPuccini at the ROH,\nand he does not\ndisappoint \\\\\nof a modern setting? If the\nplot works better in its original\nhistorical period, importing it\nto the modern era feels more\ngimmicky than constructive.\nIt is a bit hard, for example,\nto imagine anyone being sent\nto a convent or deported for\nbeing a courtesan in this day\nand age.\nNevertheless \u2013 the essence\nof an opera should remain in\nits music. Puccini\u2019s score for\nManon Lescaut is beautifully\nlush and symphonic. It was\nthought to be his response to\nthe German operatic giant\nWagner; as a great fan of\nWagner, perhaps that is\nwhy I found it particularly\nenjoyable. Antonio Pappano\nis an experienced conductor of Puccini at the Royal\nOpera House, and he did\nnot disappoint. As Manon,\nsoprano Sondra Radvanovsky\nmanaged to bring out the\ncomplexity of the character,\nwith her voice alternating to\nevoke both the lighthearted\ncoquette and the desolate\nfallen woman. Tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko also made\nfor an emotionally raw\nDes Grieux, though his\nvoice perhaps did not\nquite match up to the\npowerful orchestra.\nA very good performance all round,\nand worth going to,\neven if the production does leave a\nfew open questions\nat the end.\nJonas Kaufmann as Chevalier des Grieux in Manon Lescaut\n\\\\The Royal Opera \u00a9 ROH Bill Cooper 2014\n\n"

Its original run was a\ncultural touchstone, and its\npopularity made it an ideal\ncandidate for Netflix\u2019s recent\nrevival spree. How does the\nrevival compare?\nR\neviving beloved\nTV shows can be\na tricky business.\nShows that are\nmissed tend to build\nup a mythology\naround them; with time and\nabsence, every fault and\ninconsistency is forgiven. To\nbring them back, however,\nis to burst the rose tinted\nbubble of fond nostalgia and\npush them into the harsh lens\nof reality. For the creators,\nraising the old magic from\nthe dead is a nigh impossible\ntask, as the latest revival of\nthe X-Files proved.\nGilmore Girls, a generational show about mothers\nand daughters, was set\nagainst the backdrop of a\nquirky town in Connecticut. It\naired for seven seasons and\nwent off the air nine years\nago. The show creator, Amy\nSherman Palladino, left the\nshow at the end of the sixth\nseason in the wake of failed\ncontract negotiations. Having\nhanded over her show, she\ngave interviews in which she\nshared that she had already\nplanned the show\u2019s trajectory,\nincluding the intriguing \u2018four\nlast words\u2019. Thus, for its final\nseason, a case of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Gilmore Girls was born;\nthere was one version of\nthe show that played out on\nthe CW in weekly episodes,\nand another which remained\nhidden in Amy Sherman\nPalladino\u2019s imagination.\nNetflix couldn\u2019t have hoped\nfor a better sales pitch when\nthey decided to bring back\nthe show for a limited run of\nfour 90-minute episodes this\nyear. Finally, the world would\nsee the true Gilmore Girls, the\noriginal vision.\nBuzzfeed, AV Club, and\nTV Line went to work and\npainstakingly curated every\nlast update from the set; it\nseemed every single one of\nthe original cast members\nwould be returning: from the\ntown troubadour, to Sookie,\nplayed by Melissa McCarthy,\nwhose career has reached\nstratospheric heights from her\ndays of cheerily commanding\nthe kitchen of The Dragonfly\nInn. There was, of course,\nto be one glaring omission\nfrom the cast list, Edward\nHerrmann, who played the\nGilmore patriarch Richard\nGilmore and passed away in\n2014. How the show would\nhandle his passing remained\none the most hotly anticipated\naspects of the show\u2019s return,\nalong with the perennial ques-tion: \u2018Jess or Logan?\u2019.\nThe series finally dropped\nFriday of last week. From the\nvery first scene of \u2018Winter\u2019,\nthe opening episode of the\nrevival\u2019s quartet, it is clear\nthat Amy Sherman Palladino is very much back in\nher element. Exposition-y at\nfirst, understandable for a\nshow that is working to catch\nup its viewers on nearly a\ndecade of the characters\u2019\nlives, Gilmore Girls quickly\nsettles back into its mile-a-minute pop culture peppered\ndialogue.\nStars Hollow\u2019s cutesy New\nEngland town charm is a\nwelcome break from the real\nworld. It seems, as Lorelai\nsays at one point, truly like\na town inside a snow globe.\nThe outside world, aside\nfrom the tyranny of the wi-fi\nfree-loaders at Luke\u2019s Diner,\n\\\\ To bring back\nthem back, how-ever, is to burst the\nrose-tinted bubble of\nfond nostalgia and\npush them into the\nharsh lens of reality\n\\\\\nEven famous people have awkward family pictures \\\\ Netflix\nResiliance runs in the family \\\\ The\nCW\\Netflix\nseems hardly to have touched\nit. What the show fails to say\nabout the world at large,\nit does incredibly well in\nits interpersonal dynamics\nbetween the characters.\nEdward Herrmann\u2019s absence\nis felt keenly; the Gilmore\nwomen: his wife, Emily, his\ndaughter, Lorelai, and grand-daughter, Rory, each struggle\nto come to terms with their\ngrief, as well as how best to\nhonour him throughout the\nfour episodes.\nEmily\u2019s character arc is the\nmost drastic and the most\nsatisfying; she leaves behind\na life in Hartford society that\nbrought her no joy to live\nin a cottage in Nantucket,\nregaling schoolchildren with\ngraphic and bloody stories of\nwhaling at a new job in the\nmuseum. Lorelai finally gets\nmarried to Luke, due to an\nepiphany she has behind a\ncoffee shop (where else for\nLorelai?), after repeatedly\nattempting to find herself on\na \u2018Wild\u2019 (book) journey fail.\nIn one of the most tear-jerk-ing moments of the revival,\nshe calls her mother from\nthe top of a hill recounting\n\\\\ Stars Hollow\u2019s\ncutesy New England\ntown charm is a welcome break from the\nreal world \\\\\n\\\\ Echoing his father\u2019s wit is the\naforementioned JJ,\nplayed by real-life\nCerebral Palsy sufferer Micah\nFowler \\\\\nsitcom follows the DiMeo\nfamily as they relocate to\na new town in order to be\nable to better provide for\ntheir oldest child JJ who has\ncerebral palsy.\nSpeechless starts off\nstrongly, with a tightly\nE\nver since the success\nof the show, ABC\nseems to have made\n\u2018Modern Family\u2019 its\nmotto. Leading the\ncharge on diverse\nsitcoms, in recent years it has\nput out excellent shows like\nBlack-ish, Fresh off the boat\nand, now, Speechless. This\npaced in medias res opening sequence that rapidly\nestablishes the character\ndynamics. Minnie Driver is\nthe well-meaning but embattled mother, competitive and\njumping at the bit to right any\nperceived injustices, while\nJohn Ross Bowie (The Big\nBang Theory\u2019s Barry Kripke)\nis her sarcastic straight-man\ncounterpart. Echoing his\nfather\u2019s wit is the aforementioned JJ, played by real-life\nCerebral Palsy sufferer Micah\nFowler. Then there are his\nyounger siblings: the quintessential middle-child, Ray, and\nthe hyper-competitive runner\nDylan. An additional appendix to the family comes in the\nform of the school grounds-keeper, Kenneth, acting as an\naide to and the voice of JJ.\nThe comedy is disarming and charming, but still\nmanages to maintain a wry\nedge. It very much has the\nfeel of a John Green or early\nWes Anderson coming of age\ncomedy, but with a healthier\ndose of reality. While it\nleans on certain character\narchetypes, it never feels\nderivativeness. It is refreshingly\noptimistic, and while it treats JJ\u2019s\ncondition seriously, it does not\nreduce him to his condition.\nHe is witty, sharp, and comfortable in his own skin. I look forward\nto see how the premise develops\nwith time.\nstale. This sitcom is like an onion;\nit has layers. Take, for example,\nthe aforementioned archetypal\n\u2018middle child\u2019. He is well realised\nin his motivations and is sympathetic and understandable in his\nactions. Pains are taken to ensure\nthat these characters are justified,\nand doing so makes them feel very\nreal despite their surface-level\nBig Talk |\nSpeechless\nA modern family \\\\ ABC\nAnurag Deshpande\n\\\\ The comedy\nis disarming and\ncharming, but still\nmanages to maintain a wry edge. It\nvery much has the\nfeel of a coming of\nage comedy \\\\\nher favourite memory of her\nlate father. It\u2019s a moment of\ncatharsis for the two women\nwho have had a fraught relationship for the series\u2019 run.\nLater, in a scene mirroring\nthe first ever episode, when\nLorelai asks for money from\nher mother, and is asked\nto spend time with Emily in\nreturn, there is none of the\nbitter resentment that accompanied Friday night dinners.\nThe youngest Gilmore\u2019s\narc by contrast brings no\nreal comfort. In the original\nrun, Rory was the bookish\nwunderkind that could do\nno wrong. She glided on her\nbrains and her grandparent\u2019s\nfinancial power from Chilton\nvaledictorian to editor of the\nYale Daily News.\nEven a spectacular meltdown in the later seasons\ndidn\u2019t hold her down for\nlong- she graduated top\nof her class, and set off\non the campaign trail with\nBarack Obama (pre-2008\nrun): a fledgling Christiane\nAmanpour. The revival finds\nthe early promise of success\nshattered, utterly broken, and\nchewed up by life. Rory is by\nher own admission \u2018rootless\u2019,\nessentially unemployed,\ncouch-surfing, and always\non the search for her lucky\nunderwear (that she never\nfinds). This is the tragic side\nof her millennial identity. She\nbecomes associated with\nthe thirty-something club,\nthe gang of highly qualified\ngraduates unable to move out\nof their parents\u2019 homes.\nThe show is similarly\nunforgiving to the rest of\nRory\u2019s generation. We\nwere introduced to Lane,\nRory\u2019s childhood friend, as\na sixteen year old desperate\nto escape Stars Hollow, and\ncould be no other ending. We\nare left to presume that the\nbaby is Logan\u2019s, her engaged\ncollege boyfriend with whom\nshe\u2019s been having an affair.\nJust in case we missed the\nChristopher-Luke parallels\nbetween Logan and Rory\u2019s\nother significant boyfriend,\nJess, we are shown Jess\nthrowing a very Luke-like\nwistful look at Rory in one of\nthe closing scenes of \u2018Fall\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a neat ending, it ties\neverything up in a bow (much\nlike How I Met Your Mother\u2019s\nbig reveal that Aunt Robin\nwas the woman for Ted all\nalong). It\u2019s clever, it works on\nthe page.\nYet on screen, it is a faintly\ndisappointing end to Rory\u2019s\nstory, a girl who in her\noriginal iteration was more\nconcerned with chasing\naccomplishments than boys .\nThe Gilmore Girls revival is\nsuccessful in many ways in\nthat it manages to capture\nthe magic of the original\nrun, namely its quirkiness\nand humour. It delivers both\nlaughs and tears.\nYet it doesn\u2019t quite live up to\nthe insanely high expectations\nSherman Palladino built up\nfor herself. The show seems\nunable to move past narrative\nsymmetry to give its younger\ncharacters\u2019 endings worthy of\ntheir character growth.\nThe show allows the older\ncharacters (Emily, Luke, and\nLorelai) to grow out of the\nlives that no longer make\nthem happy and into lives that\ndo, but dooms the younger\ngeneration to retracing the\ngrooves of their parent\u2019s lives,\ntrapped in the snow globe of\nStars Hollow.\n\\\\ Rory becomes\nassociated with the\nthirty-something\nclub, the gang of\nhighly qualified\ngraduates unable\nto move out of their\nparents\u2019 homes \\\\\nher mother\u2019s antique shop,\nto live life as a rock star. She\nis shown in the revival to be\nstill working in the family busi-ness, taking care of her twin\nboys, and barely finding time\nto fit in band practice. Paris\nGeller, ever the firebrand, is\nsuccessful and still making\nteenagers cry, but has children being raised by nannies:\na reflection of the childhood\nshe also had.\nEven Logan, who managed\nto escape the family business\nhe never wanted to join in\nseason 7, is back working\nfor his father, going along\nwith a loveless relationship of\nconvenience.\nThere is a sense of\neverything coming full\ncircle in the revival. There is\nnarrative symmetry in Rory\u2019s\nadmission \u2018Mom...I\u2019m pregnant\u2019. Of course, the famous\nlast words had to be this; in\na generational show, there\n\\\\ The Gilmore Girls\nrevival is successful\nin many ways in that\nit manages to capture the magic of the\norginal run \\\\\n\n"

Either they\nabsolutely love the food,\njob and ethos or, they are\ndoing it as it\u2019s the only option\navailable to them. Frankly,\nthe peanuts that you get paid\nfor working 14 hour shifts,\noften for six days straight,\nwouldn\u2019t make any job worth\nit for the money alone. At the\nrestaurant I worked at over\nmy holidays, which would be\nconsidered fancy by some\nand expensive by most, one\nmight assume that staff have\na better living. That is not\nthe case \u2013 we calculated my\nco-workers wages at \u00a33.35/\nthere for the food. Some\nreally are only doing it as it\u2019s\nthe only option available to\nthem!\nWith that in mind, you have\nto also accept that chefs who\nwant to work for the love and\njoy of it will not necessarily\ngravitate towards some of\nthe dining establishments you\nmight frequent on a regular\nhr, if you took into account\nhis salary and lack of any\npay for overtime. I was not\nnearly so lucky \u2013 I worked\nfor completely free \u2013 but I\nhad chosen to do so to build\nmy skillset and pursue my\ncareer. I was being paid in\nthe knowledge and skills\nthat I learnt. But, I think it\u2019s\nimperative that you bear in\nmind that chefs are not all\nbasis. You don\u2019t expect the\nlove and attention to detail\nthat you might see in a fine\ndining restaurant in your local\ntakeaway, so don\u2019t expect the\nsame standards of care and\nhygiene! It\u2019s one of the reasons that I shy away from so\nmany small, hipster eateries\nwith extremely trendy overhanging haircuts, amazingly\nring laden fingers and more\npotential causes of anything\nfrom an innocuous hair, to a\nnight of the shits. And those\nare the smallest of issues\nin large kitchens. You can\nhardly begin to imagine the\nproblems that you don\u2019t see.\nRoaches in flour bags, frogs\nin unwashed salad leaves, the\nlist goes on and on.\nI\u2019m not saying that high\nend chefs are immune from\nhygiene errors, but we certainly take a lot more care.\nThings from basic food safety\ncertificates to having a head\nchef scream at you for not\nwashing your hands thoroughly all give me much more\nfaith in similar restaurants.\nSo what can you do? The\nsimple answer is to do it\nyourself! Cooking for yourself\ndoesn\u2019t guarantee you an\nescape from hairs in soup,\nor as my girlfriend once\ndiscovered a rogue fly that\nflew into her salad. But it certainly means you won\u2019t have\nanyone to blame but yourself.\nBetter than GBK\nLets be real \u2013 none of us can afford\nGBK anyhow. Fortunately, buying\nburger patties and cooking them up\ndoesn\u2019t get your hands too messy,\nand the results are delicious, as felix\nfinds out.\nI\nmust start this article\nby giving credits to my\nAnonymous Kitchen\nHelpers: they are the\nones who remade the\npuff-pastry last time, after\nruining it. It\u2019s always great\nhaving helping hands, even if\nsometimes they can be more\nof a hindrance.\nBut now I am not going to\nAndrada Balmez\ntalk about my experiences\ncooking \u2013 I want to talk about\nmy experiences eating out.\nNot going to Nandos \u2013 by\neating out I mean just changing\nkitchens in halls and not being\nthe head chef, but more like\nan assistant. It happens even\nto the best of us\u2026 but I am,\nultimately, a student so, when\nfood is offered to me, I cannot\nsimply say no. Right?\nSome of my friends decided\nto make burgers, and I decided\nto trust them and have some\nfaith that I wouldn\u2019t die. And\nbelieve it or not, I had an\nextremely delicious dinner \u2013\nwith less effort than I would\nnormally invest in a dinner \u2013 all\nI had to do was to fry some\nmeat. Easy peasy!\n\t\t\t\t\n1. Find someone who is not\nafraid to fry meat, especially\nwhen all the oil starts spitting.\nMake them feel like they have\nto do it so everyone can survive the night and start them\non frying the burgers on a high\nheat.\n2.Make the sauce: mix the\nketchup, the mayo and the\nDijon mustard in a bowl; chop\nthe onion in small pieces and\nadd it in the mixture to taste \u2013\nyou can leave it out entirely.\nChop the salad leaves into bite\nsized mouthfuls, and mix with\nthe tomatoes Finish with the\nlemon juice and mix a bit more.\n3.When the burgers are close\nto done, add the two slices of\ncheese on top of each patty\nand keep it in the pan for some\ntwo extra minutes or until the\ncheese is melted, but not for\ntoo long \u2013 you don\u2019t want\novercooked meat, right?\n4.Build your burger. Add\nsome tomato slices and maybe\nsome extra salad or onion. Top\nup with the sauce and add the\ntop slice of bun.\n5. Enjoy!\nYes, number five is actually a\nstep: you definitely must relax\nand forget about all the student\nworries and enjoy an easy-to-make and almost-healthy meal.\nIngredients\n4 burger patties\nOil\n4 burger baps, sliced\n8 slices melting cheese\n2 tbsp mayo\n1 tbsp ketchup\n1 tsp Dijon mustard\n1 small onion\nSalad leaves\n\u00bd lemon\n2 sliced tomatoes\n//Some of my\nfriends decided to\nmake burgers, and\nI decided to trust\nthem and have some\nfaith that I wouldn\u2019t\ndie.

The\nnew games offer a fresh and\nupdated take on the title while\nstill staying true to the original\nformula; they remind us why\nthe series is still so popular\nafter 20 years.\nOne of the largest changes\nthese games have brought is\nthe Island Challenge, in the\nnew Hawaii-themed region\nof Alola. This is a refreshing\nchange of pace from the previous games\u2019 usual setup of\nbeating gyms and collecting\nbadges. The challenges come\nin all sorts of forms, including\na scavenger hunt, memorising\ndance moves and tailing after\nsome water pok\u00e9mon. These\nchallenges are integrated\nwith the new environment,\nmaking you explore the new\narea and helping Alola feel\nlike its own region rather\nthan an overworld map. The\nChallenges prevent things\nfrom getting too mindless,\nsometimes showing up\nunexpectedly, and make you\nconstantly fine-tune your team\nwhile always being on alert.\nThe rewards of completing these challenges are\nZ-crystals, the new feature\ncreated for this generation.\nThese help spice up battles\nand don\u2019t feel as gimmicky\nmaking it feel like a moving\nstory, \u00e0 la the anim\u00e9.\nAs you progress through the\nworld, there are a number\nof interesting and unique\ncharacters you meet who\nadd their own flair to the mix.\nThere\u2019s the new Pok\u00e9mon\nProfessor, Kukai, who is permanently shirtless and always\nready to get into the thick of\nthings. There\u2019s also Lillie, a\ncharacter with a mysterious\npast, and your fun-loving rival\nHau. There\u2019s even someone\nwho\u2019s similar to the edgier,\ndouchebag rivals of the old\ngames, namely Gladion,who\u2019s\nobsessed with beating you.\nThe trial captains themselves\nhave more personality than\nthe old gym leaders due to\nhow much they\u2019re involved in\nthe Island Challenges and not\nconfined to gyms.\nBut, of course, this wouldn\u2019t\nbe a Pok\u00e9mon game without\nthe pok\u00e9mon and these\ngames do not disappoint.\nApart from the 80 or so new\nPok\u00e9mon (bringing the total\nto over 800!) there are also\nregional variants of some\nolder Pok\u00e9mon. Once again,\nthey are in line with the\nnature of Alola, with designs\nand characteristics that make\nsense for the region. For\nexample, the Alolan form of\nExeggutor, apart from now\nbeing a grass and dragon\ntype, is huge and basically\nresembles a palm tree. The\ngames capitalise on the\nfact that there are so many\npok\u00e9mon now, letting you\ncatch a wide variety right\nas the trailers made them out\nto be. The basic gist is that\nZ-crystals allow Pok\u00e9mon\nto use Z-Moves, which can\nonly be used once per battle\nand have varying effects.\nSome are straight up attacks\n\\\\ The new games\noffer a fresh and\nupdated take on the\ntitle while staying\ntrue to the original\nformula \\\\\nA brand new region to explore and discover! \\\\ Game Freak& Nintendo\nPok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon is\nout on the Nintendo 3DS\nwhereas others can be status\nchanges. The rest of the battling system remains the same\nas before with some minor\ntweaks like knowing the type\neffectiveness of your moves,\nand the new Battle Royale,\nwhich is a free-for-all match\nbetween four players.\nWith a 30-plus hour\nstory mode, these games\nare largely focused on\nworld-building. They are\nwritten and made in a way\nthat makes you focus on\nthe journey and adventure,\nrather than grind towards the\nend. The plot is enjoyable\nand helps stitch the entire\ngame together, even if it isn\u2019t\nparticularly special and a bit\npredictable. There is an air of\ngeneral mystique that draws\nyou forward and lets the characters speak for themselves.\nThis game in particular has a\nlarger emphasis on cutscenes,\n\\\\ The games\ncapitalise on the fact\nthat there\u2019s so many\npok\u00e9mon now,\nletting you catch a\nwide variety right\nfrom the start \\\\\nfrom the start. This makes\nteam-building more fun and\nenjoyable as opposed to\nbefore when you were stuck\nwith birds and bugs for the\nfirst three routes or so.\nThe very outdated system of\nHM\u2019s has also been removed\nand is now replaced with\nPok\u00e9mon Ride, which fulfills\nthe same purpose while being\nmore fun and enjoyable. This\nalso means you can have a\nfull team of Pok\u00e9mon that\nyou like, rather than having\none or two as obligatory HM\nslaves.\nPok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon\ncan arguably be considered\nthe best games in the series\nreleased up until now. They\u2019ve\nrejuvenated the system while\nkeeping the original DNA\nenough that new players can\neasily jump in while older\nplayers can still play with a\nsense of familiarity. It\u2019ll be\nintriguing to see where the\nseries goes next, because\nSun and Moon is clearly the\nbeginning of a new era rather\nthan the end of an old one.\n\n"

Cowan, the Leader\nPublic meeting to save Charing Cross\nA packed crowd criticised changes to A&E services\nStephen Naulls\nof the Council asked the\naudience what type of world\nwe want to hand on to our\nchildren, following a scathing\ncriticism of the government\u2019s\nplans to radically overhaul\nhealthcare in the borough as\npart of an extensive cost-cut-ting programme touted to be\nworth in excess of \u00a31.3bn.\nRoger Steer, a member\nof the team involved in the\ncritical appraisal of the STP,\nvoiced concerns over the\nviability of the plan, which\nwould see a reduction of\nin-patient capacity by 600\nbeds in a time when the population of North West London\nis projected to increase by\n26% over the next 20 years.\nThere was also a criticism of\nImperial College Healthcare\nTrust\u2019s statement claiming\n\u201cthere will be no reduction in\nthe hospital\u2019s A&E and wider\nservices during the lifetime of\nthe STP\u201d as spin, given that\nthe duration of the plan is\nonly five years; hardly providing lasting protection for the\nstatus of the hospital. Indeed,\nfor a plan which claims to be\nsustainable and transform-ative, there is little evidence\nof any consideration of the\nlong-term ramifications of the\nreforms.\nThere was further elucidation of the exact changes that\nwould be made to Charing\nCross\u2019 A&E services. Since\nHammersmith and Central\nMiddlesex A&Es were closed,\nother A&Es in London have\nstruggled to meet the national\nwaiting time requirements\ndue to increased pressure on\nservices. Again, Cllr Cowan\noutlined the calculated use of\nA&E classification to deceive\nthe public on the fate of the\nservices. Currently, CX has\na \u2018Class 1\u2019 categorisation,\nwhich NHS England defines\nas a \u201cconsultant led 24-hour\nservice with full resuscitation\nfacilities and designated\naccommodation for the\nreception of accident and\nemergency patients\u201d. The\nplans would see CX downgraded to a \u2018Class 3\u2019 A&E\nwhich is \u201cnurse led and treats\nminor injuries\u201d. As the panel\njested \u2013 if your child got their\nhead stuck in a bucket, you\u2019d\ntake them to a Class 3 A&E\nto get some Vaseline to help\nslide it off. More seriously\nthough, this draws to attention the clear deception of\nthe public on the true extent\nof the changes; in a world\nincreasingly consumed by a\npost-truth politics, politicians\nappear more concerned with\nmasking the truth from us than\nengaging in a real debate\nabout the future of our health\nservice.\nAlso under threat would be\nCharing Cross\u2019 world-class\nstroke services, which would\npotentially be relocated to St\nMary\u2019s in an effort to create\na \u2018superhub\u2019 capable of competing on the international\nstage. For campaigners from\nSave Our Hospitals on the\npanel, however, providing\nrapid and safe treatment\nfor Londoners takes priority.\nThe shift in location would\nsee two stroke centres based\nwithin one mile of each other,\npotentially leaving NW\nLondon dangerously isolated.\nThe government\u2019s pledge\nthat they could transport\nsomebody from Chiswick\nto Paddington in under 14\nminutes was laughed off by\nthe audience. But beneath the\nlaughter remains the much\ndarker truth that the extent\nof the centralisation present\nin the plan could put patients\nin danger, especially if the\npopulation projections are\naccurate and acute demand\nin NW London continues to\ngrow.\nThere was a chance\nfor ICSM students to ask\nquestions too. A member of\nBMA Imperial\u2019s contingent\nquizzed the panel on the\nconsequences for undergraduate medical training. With\nclosures resulting fewer hospitals to train in, students voiced\nconcerns that there would be\nfewer learning opportunities\ndue to saturation of their\nclinical placements with more\nstudents per consultant and\nthe impact of this on their\nongoing training.\nWhether this outcry from\nboth local residents and students at the plans will change\nthe future of Charing Cross\nremains to be seen.\n\\\\ Cowan asked\nwhat type of\nworld we want to\nhand on to our\nchildren, following\na scathing criticism\nof the government\u2019s\nplans \\\\\n\\\\ There was further\nelucidation of the\nexact changes that\nwould be made to\nCharing Cross\u2019 A&E\nservices \\\\\nTeach\nFirst\nis\na\nregistered\ncharity,\nno.\n1098294\nDevelopyourskillsandhelpputanendtoeducationalinequality.\nteachfirst.org.uk/recruitment\nApplynowforourundergraduateandgraduateopportunities\nPrint ad for Imperial.indd 1 31/10/2016 15:45:42\n\n"

OK, most mornings. OK,\nOK, I\u2019m still in bed watching Jeremy Kyle yell at someone for having\n3 wives and 1 kid whom they all swear is theirs, but we\u2019ve gone\noff topic. Seeing as this is \u2018disability week\u2019 I figured I should talk to\nsomeone who knows enough about overcoming a disability to be\nawarded an MBE, win an athletics bronze medal and participate\nin research on their own prostheses. Talk about owning your disability\n(which we will actually do, later on)! Meet David Henson. He has\nagreed to play host to my first celebrity interview and talk about how\nhe tackles playing multiple roles at once as well as re-adjusting to\nlife as a bi-lateral amputee. Why is my lethargic attitude to an\nearly morning relevant? Well read on and see why asking\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d becomes painfully clear.\nHow do you balance all the research, training and\nfame you\u2019ve acquired since becoming both an academic researcher and Paralympic athlete?\nI think the balance is something that\u2019s developed over time, so certainly when I started\nmy PhD last year, the balance was too much\nin the favour of my PhD and my athletics and\nhome life suffered. Then, as I got closer to the\nParalympics, my academic and home life suffered as I put too much on athletics. I\u2019ve just\nfinished the 2015/16 athletics season and I\u2019m just\ntrying a new way of balancing all of the different\nactivities I\u2019ve got going on. With a bit more of a\nbias towards the academics. Even though I\u2019m a part-time PhD student, I\u2019d like to push on with my work;\nthat\u2019s where my career lies. As for athletics, while it\u2019s\na career now, it\u2019s not going to last forever. It\u2019s physically\nimpossible to last forever. So, when I finish athletics, whenever\nthat might be, I want my career to be in a good spot to take over.\nI actually find all the different elements to be complimentary to one\nanother. As an amputee pushing into the high level sport that I\u2019ve done,\nI\u2019ve found weaknesses and limitations of my body, that take place on a\nday-to-day basis, are all amplified at speed. I think it\u2019s easier to identify\nfunctional weaknesses in my body where I can improve and how that\ncan translate from the track into everyday life and how it can inform my\nresearch. I think that it all works well, but definitely finding that balance\nand keeping supervisors happy is a difficult one, but I tend to make it\nwork by getting up earlier. On a University day, I get up at 4:15 [am]\nand I\u2019m in the office by 7:00 [am], sometimes earlier. I\u2019ll try and a get a\ntraining session in either before work or during the day with the fabulous\npeople in my department [I possibly count as one of these people due to\nthe single time I went running with David]. A normal training session will\nbe two hours on the track and an hour and a half to two hours in the gym\nand I\u2019ll get those done back-to-back. In the morning, I\u2019ll be on the track\nat 8:00am and I\u2019ll have all my training sessions done by midday. Then\nI\u2019ll have some lunch and I\u2019ll be working from home in the afternoon. So\nit works out but it\u2019s taken a long time to get right.\nYou mention finding things out about your body. As you\u2019re an ampu-tee, do you find there\u2019s a more personal than professional drive in your\nresearch looking at amputees?\nDefinitely, one of the things I perhaps worried about at\nthe start of the research was a bias but I think it\u2019s OK.\nI\u2019m coming at this from a bias point-of-view, it does\nprovide a massive drive for me. I never really saw\nmyself as an academic, I never thought I was clever\nenough to do that. Before I joined the army I was\na mechanical engineer, then I joined and went\nthrough the officer route and as far as I was\nconcerned that was my career. That\u2019s what I\nwas going to do and that\u2019s what I was happy\ndoing. All I ever really wanted to do was be an\nengineer in the army. When I lost my legs I was\nforced to reconsider my career route, I could\nhave stayed in the army and flown a desk for a\nwhile which isn\u2019t quite the same. I joined to be\na professional soldier, to go on operations and\nthat side of my life was taken away from me so it\nbecame non-viable. Looking back on previous qualifications and the situation I found myself in, with the\nprosthetics, I felt that I could use my own experiences\nto make things better for the amputee population. [I\nhave] a distinct bias towards military amputees, as they\u2019re\nessentially my extended family \u2013 a group I personally care\nabout on an intimate level \u2013 so I came back to Imperial to do a\nMasters in engineering and more research into kinds of engineering\nsystems that can be developed for interaction with the human body.\nFrom the masters I felt I didn\u2019t know enough still, so I wanted to carry on\nto a PhD so I knew enough about my own body and my own situation\nto try and contribute towards solving the problem, rather than waiting\nfor someone else to solve it for me. Qualifications aside, it\u2019s been so\nbeneficial to me from a psychological point of view. There are strong\nlinks between service men and women coming out of that service envi-ronment, and the lack of contribution you once felt as part of the army,\nand depression and mental health problems and I feel that switching\nstraight into academia and contributing in a different way has kept my\nDavidHenson\nMBE\nMilitaryveteran\nBronzemedallist\nPhDstudent\n\\\\ Roger Keller\n\\\\ Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes\nmental health at a stable and positive level.\nWith a focus on Imperial College, does access to the College\nor the ability to move around campus hamper you at all? How\nwould you rate the facilities we have here?\nFor a central London based institution, it could be a lot\nworse. We are limited by real-estate, everything has to\ngo up. So there are lifts and there are old buildings\nlinked into new buildings, so it\u2019s a very difficult map\nto negotiate. I get a parking permit and there are\nlifts everywhere, sometimes there are issues with the\naccess facilities being maintained properly. The lifts\ncan be broken which causes a number of problems.\n[The lifts] are few and far between so there\u2019s a fair\namount of walking but actually the college has gone out\nof their way to make sure everything they can do is done\nto a reasonable standard. There are a limited number\nof toilet facilities and sometimes the disabled facilities are\neither broken or occupied and that makes things difficult for\nsomeone with a disability. I don\u2019t feel like it hampers me unless\nthings have gone wrong. There have been times when a lift has\nbeen out of order and has been for a long time, which massively\naffects how far I have to walk. If I have to walk further, then I\u2019m\nmore tired which affects the work I\u2019m doing. The distance is only\neight or nine hundred metres but as an amputee walking is difficult\nbecause you\u2019ve lost your legs and any extra walking you have to\ndo is taxing.\nAnd has being an amputee hampered your ability to do research?\nNo, absolutely not. I\u2019ve benefited by coming through the military\nsystem, whose focus is on rehabilitation and occupational health so\ngetting someone ready to return to work is massive. I was in a very\ngood position, mentally and physically, to come back to work. I\nnever felt any hesitation or dubiousness about coming back to Imperial. I knew I could do it and I don\u2019t think [being an amputee] has\nhampered me. I\u2019m in the biomechanics lab, which means we\nuse [reflective] marker systems and I need to place things\non ankles, therefore I\u2019m down on the floor, so may have\nto get someone else to do that for me. But, my brain is\nstill functioning, the rest of my body is still functioning and it\u2019s all about thinking your way through\nobstacles that you are confronted with.\nIf you have other disabilities, such as being\nblind, deaf or having lost your arms, do you\nthink research isn\u2019t as accessible?\nThere\u2019s definitely no excuse not to do it if it\u2019s\nsomething you want to do as there\u2019s always a\nsolution. In this science and technology insti-tution, there are people that can help develop\na solution if one doesn\u2019t already exist. My\nGrandad is blind, 90 years old, and completed\nhis bachelor\u2019s degree five years ago. He did a\ndegree in Law so he required someone to help him\nread papers and get the background information he\nneeded but it worked out fine. If he can do it, then a\n30-year old man who\u2019s lost his legs can do it.\nHere at felix, we\u2019d like to get an idea of how individuals are\n\u2018owning their disability\u2019. Do you get many people asking for you\nto participate in their research? And because you want to own\nyour disability, do you approach it as \u201cI\u2019m going to help as many\npeople as possible\u201d?\nIt\u2019s a difficult one. You do get asked to do an awful lot\nwhich is why, certainly from a research point of view, I\u2019d\nalways advocate paying people with a disability to come\nand do your study as chances are they\u2019ve been asked\nto do a few before. You essentially become someone\nwith a specialist qualification, so being reimbursed can\nsave them getting frustrated by what they\u2019re doing.\nThe individual can then build it into an income which\ngoes a long way. It\u2019s a weird one as you want to help\nthe cohort you\u2019re a part of and you want to contribute\nto the collective knowledge on that particular disability.\nYou just have to balance it; you do need to own your\ndisability which generally means getting back to work.\nIt means you don\u2019t have all that time available but you do\nfeel a certain obligation to go and take part. You have to\nmake sure your delegation and allocation of time is well man-aged. Otherwise, you can get swamped and you start working\ninto the evenings which affects your home life. If you start taking\ntoo many hours out of the day, you\u2019ve got to make those hours\nup at some point so it\u2019s understanding where you can make them\nup and being more flexible. It is all about owning your disability,\nwhether that\u2019s contributing to society through being a taxpayer, or\ncontributing to the knowledge of your condition by taking part in\nor conducting research.\nDo you feel you\u2019re treated differently in research because you\u2019re\ndisabled?\nI don\u2019t know, I hope not. I don\u2019t feel like I have been treated differently as a result of my disability. There are other things which I\ndon\u2019t think give me special favours, but other projects I have going\non outside of Imperial give links to the college so I feel like a have\na slightly different role to that of a normal PhD student just because\nof where I\u2019ve come from. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s through disability;\nthe only special dispensation I get are to do with access\nand if I ask for a different chair or lower desk then those\nprovisions are put in place. But my deadlines are still\nthe same, still have to do the same presentations,\nstill have to submit papers and everything is still\nthe same. They just try and make me feel a bit\nmore comfortable.\nDavid has in no way let his \u2018disability\u2019 ruin\nhis life. During the interview I could tell he\nhad spoken enough about the traumatic loss\nof his legs that continuing to talk about it only\ndrives him more to improve the experience for\nthose who will unfortunately follow him. I am\nhumbled to have been given an insight into the\neveryday life of a man who would usually be\nout on the track or sitting on numerous committees in an advisory role. Here is someone who has\npicked themselves up and tackled the problem head\non. His attitude of using his own experiences to help\nothers is a mantle I hope more take up, not just for the\nbenefit of others, but allowing them as an individual to truly\nown their disability. Maybe I should start setting my alarm.\n\\\\ My brain is still functioning, the rest\nof my body is still functioning and it\u2019s\nall about thinking your way through\nobstacles that you are confronted\nwith \\\\\nSam Smith\n\\\\ Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes\n\n"

Take\npity on Kafka \u2013\nwhile having an\neponymous adjective may\nmean your style has made\nits lasting mark on popular\nculture, it also means that it\nhas become ripe for parody;\nnever mind the legions\nFarahani plays his wife\nLaura, who turns her hand to\nnumerous creative endeav-ours, and dreams of being\na black-and-white-outfitted\ncupcake-baking country-star.\nThe film covers a week in\nPaterson\u2019s life, and the routine\nis immediately established:\nwaking early, Paterson drives\nhis bus around the city,\neavesdropping on the passengers and writing poetry\nin his breaks while his wife\npaints and makes new outfits;\nreturning home, he walks his\ndog and stops off at a bar\nfor a beer. The scene fades\nto black, and the new day\ndawns.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much\nit. The days aren\u2019t all the\nsame, but very little actually\nhappens. There\u2019s no grand\nnarrative arc, no crucial\ndenouement \u2013 in essence, Jarmusch rejects the conventional\ntrappings of screenwriting.\nBut Paterson is all the better\nfor it: through paring down\nthe plot, Jarmusch strips away\nany extraneous flesh, leaving\na clean bone of a film \u2013 one\nan inner strength as true and\nclear as the waterfall Paterson goes to every lunch-break\nfor inspiration.\nPaterson operates on one\nlevel as a rejection of modern\nlife, made not in anger, but\nin quiet dignity, and a heroic\ntribute to blue-collar America:\nPaterson refuses to use a\ncell-phone, surrounds himself\nwith mid-century design, and\nhides away in a basement\nden stacked with books and\nDIY paraphernalia. But it is\nfar from a one-sided assault\non modernity: Laura uses a\nlaptop and a tablet, and Paterson never makes any form\nof grand statement about\nwhy he eschews technology.\nWith Paterson, Jarmusch is\nnot railing against the horror\nof screen-burn. Instead, he\nis encouraging us all to stop\nand look around, to take in\nthe wonderful magic of everyday life.\n\u2018They\u2019re just words,\u2019 Paterson says towards the end\nof the film, referring to the\npoems in his notebook. Yes,\nwords may only be words,\nbut in Paterson, Jarmusch has\nmanaged so masterfully to\nuse spoken words to conjure\nup a fantastical tone poem,\none whose strength lies in\nits stoic dignity. Paterson is\na truly generous film, one\nthat \u2013 to bastardize William\nCarlos Williams somewhat\n\u2013 is so sweet and so cool,\nin equal measures. It is an\nuplifting display of hope in\nthese trying times: hope in the\ninnate goodness of the human\nspirit, in the healing power of\ncreativity, and in the essential\nbeauty of everyday life.\nFred Fyles\nJimJarmusch\u2019slatestworkPaterson\nis a breathtaking exploration\nof day-to-day life, blissful love,\nand the sheer power of poetry.\n\\\\ Jarmusch has\ncreated a many-layered film that\nbelies its simple\npremise, and merits\nrepeat viewings \\\\\nthat can powerfully yet subtly\nshow off its best attributes.\nThe dialogue, as you would\nexpect from Jarmusch, is\nsimply superb, completely\nnailing the wandering nature\nof conversational speech; it\u2019s\nlike being an intimate witness\ninto dozens of fascinating\nconversations, allowing us\nto revel in the simple power\nof language. Cues and references in the script are brought\nback again and again, both\nvisually and through speech,\ncreating a many-layered film\nthat belies its simple premise,\nand merits repeat viewings.\nDriver is on superlative form\nhere, easily delivering his best\nperformance on screen yet.\nHis Paterson is \u2013 compared\nto those around him \u2013 a quiet\ncypher, one who is more\ncomfortable listening than\ntalking, and stands at the eye\nof a cyclone of conversation;\nthe majority of his lines come\nin the form of a voice-over\nof him reading his free-verse\npoems, written by New\nYork School member Ron\nPadgett. Driver displays great\nbravery in taking on this role:\npoetry reading, especially in\nfilms, has associations with\nover-dramatisation and poor\nwriting skills. Driver and\nJarmusch eschew the easy\noption, which would have\nDriver reading out obviously\npoor-quality work; instead,\nDriver lovingly gives the\npoems the attention and care\nthey deserve, but no more,\nmaking them all the more\nA nuanced study of domestic bliss \\\\ Soda Pictures\nA stunning\nstudy of\neveryday\nbeauty\nof individuals who use\nKafkaesque as a synonym\nfor \u2018dark\u2019, \u2018alienating\u2019, or\n\u2018pertaining to queues\u2019. As\nsuch, perhaps American\ndirector Jim Jarmusch\nshould be worried: over\nhis last eleven films, since\nhis directorial debut in\n1980, Jarmusch has carved\nout a niche for himself in\nindependent American\ncinema with his trademark\nstyle. Going into a Jarmusch\nfilm, you sort of know what to\nexpect: reels of exceptionally-crafted dialogue; an\nindustrial, washed-out\nsoundtrack; and probably\na cameo from Tom Waits.\nSurely it\u2019s only a matter of\ntime before \u2018Jarmuschian\u2019\nenters into our popular\nlexicon.\nOn paper, Paterson, his 12th\nfilm, finds Jarmusch treading\ndangerously close to the\nrealm of self-parody: Adam\nDriver stars as Paterson, a\nbus driver living in Paterson,\nNew Jersey with a penchant\nfor modernist American\npoetry, particularly William\nCarlos Williams, and his epic\npoem Paterson; Golshifteh\n\\\\ In Paterson,\nJarmusch has\nmanaged so\nmasterfully to use\nspoken words\nto conjure up a\nfantastical tone\npoem, one whose\nstrength lies in its\nstoic dignity \\\\\n\\\\ Driver is on\nsuperlative form\nhere, easily\ndelivering his best\nperformance on\nscreen yet \\\\\npowerful for it. Similarly, Farahani is pleasingly earnest as\nLaura, whose creative interests pull her in a multitude of\ndifferent directions. A lesser\nfilm would portray Laura as\na scatterbrain, a dilettante\nwho will never get anywhere.\nBut Paterson never stoops this\nlow: the central pair are perfectly charming, possessive of\nJames Marsh is acclaimed as\none of the best documentarians\nworking today. Ben Collier takes\na look at two of his most famous\nworks, Man on Wire and Project\nNim, to latest if the man can live\nup to all that hype (spoiler: not\nreally...)\nI\noften hear people sing\nthe praises of director\nJames Marsh and his two\nsupposed classics Project\nNim and Man on Wire.\nHaving recently seen\nboth films, I thought it would\nbe interesting to present my\nreviews this week in tandem.\nThe reason for this is that I\nnoticed a lot of similarities\nin presentation and subject\nmatter between these two\nfilms\u2026 I also bloody hated\none and quite liked the other.\nIt just so happens that Man\non Wire \u2013 which fell under\nthe \u201cbloody hated it\u201d banner\n\u2013 was the first of the two I\nchose to watch. It documents\nthe life of French gymnast\nPhilippe Petit, an eccentric\ntight-rope walker, most well\nknown for his stunt-walk\nbetween the twin towers.\nWhilst I ultimately see this\nfeat as slightly overhyped,\nit was undeniably big news\nin its time and therefore a\nseemingly good subject for\na documentary. Overall, the\n\u2018feel\u2019 of the film is competent\nenough and the editing is\nadequate, if lacking a certain\nenergy. The problem with\nthe film is simply its content:\nunless you like seeing people\nparroting endless, repetitive\npraise for two hours, hyping\nup an event for which there\nonly exists four photographs\nand is over in five minutes, I\nwouldn\u2019t recommend it.\nThe main problem here is\nPhilippe. He comes across as\na selfish, self-aggrandising\negotist and, unlike in Project\nNim, no one featured in the\nfilm seems to question what a\nhorrible man he is. For exam-ple, at one point Philippe talks\nabout cheating on his long\nterm girlfriend immediately\nafter completing his walk and\nthe story is romantically used\nto make Philippe seem oh-so\npassionate and mysterious.\nLater on, Philippe allows\nthe same girlfriend (along\nwith many friends) to be\nextradited from the US and\ncuts contact with them. This\nact isn\u2019t condemned at all,\nbeyond one of his friends\nshowing a bit of emotion\nwhen he talks about quickly\nforgiving him. With not one\ndissenting voice in the entire\ndocumentary, I am forced to\nbelieve that Marsh intended\nme to root for (maybe even\nlike?) this man.\nThe recreations of Philippe\nand his team sneaking their\nequipment into the towers\nwas initially going to be the\none redeeming aspect of\nthis film. However, a quick\nGoogle search reveals that\nalmost all of the story was\nexaggerated or completely\nmade up in an attempt to\nmake Philippe appear more\ndaring and rebellious than he\nactually was. Whilst I understand the need to dramatize\nthe real world for the sake of\nan engaging story (The Cove\ndid this well, for example) this\npart of the film just made me\nfeel lied to. Ultimately, Man\non Wire is not the awe-inspir-ing masterpiece I\u2019ve heard\nnumerous critics describe\nit as. It\u2019s an overly long,\nhero-worshipping, and unfor-givably boring film about a\nman who deserves absolutely\nnone of your attention.\n\u00a7\nI think it\u2019s time for a bit more\npositivity. Pleasingly, the 2011\nfeature Project Nim, also\ndirected by Marsh, succeeds\nin a lot of places that Man on\nWire fails. The documentary\ndescribes a controversial\nstudy from the 1980s, which\ninvestigated whether a chimpanzee (Nim) could be taught\nsign language and communicate with humans. When the\nproject ends in failure, Nim\nfinds himself in ever direr situations before dying at a very\nyoung age.\nIt is the experiment itself, run\nby Dr Herbert \u2018Herb\u2019 Terrace,\nthat makes up the bulk of the\nrunning time. Manipulative\nand selfish, Herb is almost\nas unlikable a character as\nMan on Wire\u2019s Philippe Petit:\nbeyond merely his character,\nHerb\u2019s experiment \u2013 which\nseemed to take a back seat\nto Herb sleeping with all of\nhis students \u2013 is ultimately\npresented as pseudo-scien-tific nonsense. The idea of\ntaking a baby chimp from\nhis mother and entrusting a\nclueless, upper-middle class\nhippy family to then teach it\nsign language during adolescence is a wholly pointless\nscientific endeavour in my\neyes. What\u2019s important here\nis that there is a difference\nin how Herb (in contrast to\nPhilippe) is presented to us by\nthe director. Where Philippe\nwas showcased in a romanti-cised light and talked about\nexclusively by his hero-wor-shiping \u2018friends\u2019, Herb \u2013 and\nhis experiment \u2013 are actually\nchallenged. He isn\u2019t free from\nscrutiny as Philippe seemed to\nbe, allowing the film to focus\non an unlikable man and\nhave it not ruin the expe-rience. I, for one, actually\nloved to hate him.\nI felt a similar way towards\nNim\u2019s first human \u2018mother\u2019\nStephanie LaFarge. In our first\nact we see a lot of Stephanie\nraising Nim like a human child\nin her bourgeois-bohemian\nNew York mansion. What\u2019s\ndifferent about Stephanie\nis that she is so ridiculous,\nindulgent, and stupid that\nshe doesn\u2019t even require any\nruntime being set aside for\ncriticism. Anthropomorphising\nher little \u2018child\u2019 constantly,\nStephanie at one point speaks\nabout trying to smoke weed\nwith Nim and even discusses\nsexual tension between the\ntwo\u2026 I wish I were joking.\nIn most other aspects the\nfilm is perfectly passable.\nThe post-production job here\nwas obviously monumental,\nand the filmmakers did well\nto establish a steady pace\nand coherent story line. Just\nas a little aside to finish on\n\u00ad\u00ad\n\u2013 I wasn\u2019t a fan of the fact\nthat all the interviews took\nplace in front of generic grey\nbackground. I have always\nconsidered it much more\neffective when documen-tarians film their subjects in\nsomewhere more personal\nto their interviewee. Fictional\nfilms do not have a monopoly\non the use of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne,\nand by choosing interesting\nand personal locations we\ncan often gain an understanding of characters. Since\ncharacters are the driving\nforce in these two films, it\u2019s a\nsmall change that would have\nadded a lot.\nDocumentary Corner | James Marsh Special\nDon\u2019t look down! \\\\ 2008, Jean-Louis\nBlondeau\\Polaris Images\nIt\u2019s a monkey, not a baby \\\\ BBC Films\n\\\\ Man on Wire is\noverly long, hero-worshipping, and an\nunforgivably boring\nfilm \\\\\n\\\\ The project is\nultimately presented\nas pseudo-scientific\nnonsense \\\\\n\n"

Mathematical fractals,\nsuch as \u2018the Mandelbrot\nSet\u2019 are simply formed by\nrepeating the same equation\nthousands of times and\nlooping the answer into the\nstart. This forms an infinitely\ncomplex pattern, which can\nform beautiful pictures when\nviewed graphically. For this\nreason, fractals are often\nused in fashion as well as\ncreative arts with one famous\nexample being paintings by\nKatsushika Hokusai. Even\nthe work of famous classical\nmusicians has underlying\nfractal algorithms to explain\nA foundation in fractals\nF\nollowing the general\nvibes of this tragic\nexcuse of a year,\nscientists have now\nconfirmed that 2016\nhas seen the largest\ncoral die-off ever recorded on\nAustralia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.\nThe most affected area\nruns along the northern part,\nwhere an average of 67%\nof all shallow-water coral\nhas been lost in the past 8-9\nmonths.\nThe worst part is that the\nnorth side of the reef was the\nmost pristine and protected\nsection of this natural marvel.\nThe well-known marine\nresearch station, Lizard\nIsland, is directlywhere most\nof the die-off has occurred.\nEarlier this year, I asked a\nfriend of mine how to get\ninvolved with the research\nthey were doing and she just\nreplied \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend it right now, the coral\nis bleached to heck and\neveryone working there is a\nbit sad at the moment\u201d. I now\nrising temperatures. For now,\nthese parts are safe, but it\nwould take at least 10-15\nyears before the northern\narea of the reef regains its\ncoral. However, there is a\nrisk of a fourth bleaching\nevent this coming summer that\ncould damage the already\nbroken reef beyond repair.\nAn even more terrifying\nprediction has also been put\nforward by Drew Harvell, a\nrenowned professor in ecology biology who specialises\nin marine diseases. She says\nthat after mass bleaching\nevents, outbreaks of coral\ndisease often follow as \u201cthe\ndouble whammy of corals\nbeing stressed and warm\ntemperatures favour infectious\nmicro-organisms\u201d.\nThe take away message\nfrom this story, is if you\u2019ve\never fancied visiting this\nnatural wonder, do it sooner\nrather than later. With these\nclimate predictions, it won\u2019t\nbe so \u2018Great\u2019 in a few years\u2019\ntime.\nunderstand why.\nFurther south, scientists\nwere very much relieved to\nsee lower levels of death and\ndestruction. Professor Andrew\nBaird led teams of divers to\nre-survey the reefs in October\nand November, and has\nconfirmed that on average 6%\nof bleached corals died in the\ncentral region, and only 1%\nin the south this year. These\ncorals have bounced back\npost-bleaching and regained\ntheir vibrant colour. This is\nwelcome news after the majority of them bleached over\nsummer, and there were fears\nmany were too far gone.\nThe reason for this partial\nprotection of the reef may\nbe to do with the upwelling\nof cold water from the Coral\nSea reducing heat stress from\nBarrier bleaching isn\u2019t so Great\nAquestionofbodyandmind\nBen Sharpless discusses the latest controversy surrounding the new \u00a35 note\nA\nn ever growing\nbody of\nevidence is\nsuggesting that\ndepression,\nand other\nforms of mental illness, can be\nlinked with physical conditions\nlike bowel and skin diseases.\nWhile it\u2019s clear that mental\ndisorders are associated\nwith a higher incidence of\nphysical conditions, how\ngeneralized (over a range\nof physical health outcomes)\nthese associations are is far\nless clear.\nA recent study by psychologists at the University of Basel\nand Ruhr University Bochum\nhas identified temporal patterns in the mental and physical\nstate of 6,500 young people.\nIn particular, the study links\narthritis and digestive system\ndiseases with depression,\nanxiety with skin disease\nand others like epilepsy with\neating disorders. Previously,\nevidence linking physical and\nmental disease was largely on\na single-case basis, but for the\nfirst time it has been formally\nnoted that the two are corre-lated, with physical diseases\noccurring more frequently in\nadolescents having previously\nsuffered a mental illness. Interestingly, the same might be said\nabout mental disorders occurring after the onset of particular\nphysical diseases. Diseases\nrelating to moods, feelings\nor attitudes like depression\noften saw the development of\narthritis or digestive diseases,\nwhile anxiety disorders were\nmore common with people\nwith a history of heart disease.\nAnother study looked at\nthe association of 16 specific\nmental disorders with the\nsubsequent onset or diagnosis\nof 10 chronic physical condi-tions. The cases were spread\nacross 17 countries, with the\nmain outcome of the study\nbeing that all kinds of mental\ndisorders were associated, at\nleast in part, with a significant\nrisk of developing one of a\nwide range of chronic physical\nconditions. The authors suggest\nthat current efforts to improve\nthe physical health of individuals might be too narrowly\nfocused on a small group of\nthe most severe mental disor-ders, while it might be more\noptimal to consider integrating\nphysical health considerations\ninto the treatment of all mental\ndisorders, as early as possible.\nThese studies offer insight\ninto the causal relationship\nbetween physical and mental\ndisease, throwing light on the\nprocesses that are relevant\nto their origins and perhaps\nhow to better treat them indi-vidually, or even together. The\nresults of these studies, and\nothers, are likely to cause many\nto doubt the effectiveness of\nwhat can only be described\nas the appalling treatments\nthat exist for many serious\nmental diseases. Arguably,\nwe\u2019re not advanced in the\nareas of physical science,\nphilosophy or psychology to\nfully explain the interaction\nbetween physical and mental\ndisease, or how to properly\ncure them. That said, now\nthat the relationship between\nthem is better established,\nwe might better anticipate\nmental or physical disease\nin all their forms. The origins\nof one might well stimulate\nthe onset of the other, and\nperhaps more study into the\nnature of this relationship will\nlead to better treatment, and\nultimately prevention of the\ncrippling and cyclic nature of\nmental and physical disease.\n\u00a35fortopqualityanimalfat\nI\nntroduced in September\nof this year, the revamped\n\u00a35 bank notes are\ndesigned to be more\nrobust and last longer\nthan the previous edition.\nAlready seen in countries\nlike Australia, Canada and\nIndonesia, these polymer\nbank notes are designed\nnot to be torn, therefore\nincreasing their lifespan by\nabout 2.5 times, reducing the\nneed to produce more.\nThough unlike these\nbanknotes, the UK\u2019s \u00a35 note\ncontains one surprising ingredient \u2013 tallow.\nTallow is a processed form\nof rendered beef fat obtained\nfrom cows, and is probably\nbest known as once being\nused in candles as the main\nform of light in pre-electrical\ntimes. More recently, it is\nfound in soap, the production\nof biofuels, and food produc-tion, such as deep-fryed fast\nfood.\nThe Bank of England has\ndeclined to comment on any\nfurther details about the use\nof animal fat in its banknotes,\nwithout giving a reason or a\npossible alternative, but the\nnews has left many people\nangered and triggered a\nlarge online petition to have\nthe banknotes removed\nor replaced. While most\nof the time vegans \u2013 and\nother consumers \u2013 have a\nchoice to consume animal or\nnon-animal goods, there is\nlittle choice when it comes to\nwhich currency you use. The\nuse of animal fats also implicates religious groups such\nas some Hindu, Sikh and Jain\ngroups, who are forbidden\nto use beef products, in line\nwith their faith.\nProtesters argue its use as\nunethical and needless, citing\nthe lack of animal fats in\npolymer banknotes of other\ncountries, and the petition\nagainst the use of tallow in\n\u00a35 banknotes has reached\n100,000 signatures at the\ntime of writing.\nF\nact: A 10-year old\ngirl discovered a\nnew molecule in her\nchemistry lesson.\nAnyone who did\nchemistry at school\nwill remember those ball-and-stick molecule toys that\nteachers used to try and\nget everyone enthusiastic\nabout covalent bonding.\nBut 10 year old Clara\nLazen decided she knew\nmore than her teacher.\nClara managed to\narrange black, red and\ngreen balls (represent-ing carbon, oxygen and\nnitrogen) into a complicated arrangement that\nlooks like the result of a\nbet on who could make\nthe most excessive molecule before someone got\nshouted at. And yet, when\nshe asked her teacher if it\nwas real, he wasn\u2019t sure.\nTurned out she had discovered tetranitratoxycarbon\n\u2013 a molecule that doesn\u2019t\nexist in nature, but could\ntheoretically be made in\na lab. Cue the youngest\nauthor of a paper in Computation and Theoretical\nChemistry and everlasting jokes about being the\nteacher\u2019s pet. While the\nmolecule hasn\u2019t actually\nbeen made yet, in theory\nit could be used to store\nenergy or as an explosive similar to dynamite.\nFunnily enough, now she\u2019s\nmore interested in biology\nand medicine.
