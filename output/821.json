    "content": "Feature\nShould web an babies? Recent developments in Parliament\nhave suggested that a Private\nMembers Bill similar to David\nAlton's may be introduced to this\nParliamentary year. It seems,\ntherefore, likely that abortion-related issues will be back in the\nnews in 1989.\nAbortion is perhaps a most relevant\nissue to young people. It is likely\nthat within the not-too-distant\nfuture most students will have faced\nthe questions, whether directly or\nindirectly, of having an abortion. In\nthis article, I, as Chairman of PATA\n(Positive Alternatives to Abortion)\nwould like to put the case against\nabortion.\nI would like to do this by first of\nall discussing the concept of\n'Human Life' and then countering\nthe argument of pro-abortionists.\nAfter this I would like to detail the\nvarious methods of abortion and\nfinally to conclude by suggesting\nalternatives and ways in which the\ndemand for abortion can be\nreduced.\nCentral to the moral argument\nagainst abortion is the belief that\nfrom conception the human embryo\nis a new and distinct 'Human Life'.\nHowever, the term 'Human Life' is\none of difficulty. Depending upon\npersonal preference it may be\ndefined in many ways; for example\nspiritually, philosophically, or\nscientifically. Let us consider these\nthree approaches for a moment.\nThe spiritual approach usually\nregards 'Human Life' as beginning\nat the moment a soul becomes\npresent. This sort of approach is\nassociated with religious groups and\nalthough it seems rather vague, it is\nimportant to note that all the\nWorld's major religions oppose\nabortion.\nThe philosophical approach\nusually bases its arguments around\nvague and arbitrary concepts such\nas 'consciousness' and 'degree of\ncult uri z ation'. As these\nphilosophical arguments are highly\nsubjective and very difficult to\nprove, there is no general consensus\nfrom this approach.\nFrom the moment of\nconception there\nexists a complete\nhuman being\nFinally, there is the scientific\napproach. Unlike the other two, this\napproach is neither subjective or\nnon-provable. It is a biological fact\nthat from the moment of human\nconception there exists a distinct\nhuman being who is both alive and\nof the human species\u2014a 'Human\nLife'.\nWhat is so significant about the\nmoment of conception that makes\nBy the 8th week the\nembryo is essentially\ncomplete\nit the starting point for life? First of\nall, it is the very first point at which\nthe genetic, physiological and\norganic make-up of the embryo is\nestablished. It is the point at which\nlife, in the form of the growth and\ndevelopment of the embryo, begins.\nSecondly, nothing short of death,\nwhether by natural or artificial\nmeans, will prevent the embryo\nfrom developing into a newly-born\nbaby. This cannot be said about any\npoint before conception.\nLet us now consider the\ndevelopment of this human life\nfrom conception to birth.\nAt conception the development of\nthe embryo begins. As soon as the\n18th day, the heart has begun to\nbeat. By the 25th day the embryo's eyes, spinal cord, nervous system\nand major internal organs are\nbeginning to form. From the 6th week onwards, brain waves can be\ndetected, the complete skeleton has\nbeen formed in cartilage and pain\ncan be felt.\nBy the 8th week the embryo is\nessentially complete. At this time\nshe (assuming a female embryo) can\nspontaneously move her limbs and\nresponds to touch. Bone is\nbeginning to replace cartilage and\nfrom now until birth she is known\nas a 'foetus'\u2014meaning 'young one'.\nIn the 3rd month the baby moves\nmore vigorously, inhales and\nswallows the amniotic fluid, and\nurinates. Within another month she\nis about 30cm long and her heart\npumps 50 pints of blood per day.\nShe sleeps, wakes, responds to light\nand sound and may even suck her\nthumb. From now until birth,\nfurther development is largely a matter of growth. Under British law,\nabortion is still allowed for another\n3 months.\nThe first medical ethic is t, Hippocrates, forbade all abortion.\nEven as late as 1949, the World\nMedical Federation adopted the\nGeneva Code of medical ethics'\nwhich state that;\nT will maintain the utmost respect\nfor Human Life from the moment of\nconception'\nWhy have attitudes changed so\nmuch since then? I believe part of\nthe answer lies in the area of\nfinancial expediency and ignorance.\nBut more of this later.\nCountering the Arguments\nA main argument in favour of\nabortion relates to the physically\nand mentally disabled. The\nargument runs; 'If an unborn child\nis found to be mentally or physically\ndisabled, then it is in the interest of\nthe child and mother that an\nabortion be carried out'.\nThis argument is riddled with\nholes. First of all as an argument in\nfavour of abortion its applicability is\nvery limited. Of the three milion or\nso abortions carried out in England\nand Wales since 1967, less than 3\n%\nwere on the grounds of physical or\nmental handicap.\nSecondly, it arrogantly assumes\nthat a handicapped person would\nrather be dead than alive. Just\nbecause a handicapped person\nwould rather not be handicapped,\nit does not follow that they would\nrather be dead.\nIt is also very unclear about what\nactually constitutes a physical or\nmental handicap. Surely blindness\nand deafness are physical\nhandicaps! What about a club foot!\nEven if the argument dealt only with\nthe 'severely physically and\nmentally disabled', it would still be\nequally difficult to define which\ndisabilities are severe and which are\nnot. And what gives us the right to\nmake these kinds of decisions\nanyway?\nIn many ways this argument is\nreally one of financial expedience.\nIt is much cheaper to have an\nabortion than to look after a handicapped child. This is a factor\nof which governments are very\nmuch aware, but rarely admit.\nHowever, the DHSS did come close\nto admitting just this in a report\ncalled 'Prevention and Health:\nEverybody's Business (HMSO\n1976)', when in reference to the\ndemands made on the health and\nsocial services by mongol and spina\nbifida children, they stated;\n'...it seems likely that, in general,\nthe cost of these demands will\nexceed the cost of a program to\ndetect the condition.'\nNo civilised society can justify\nabortion on the grounds that it is\ncheaper to abort than to care.\nIt is often argued that abortion is\nPage 22 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Travel\nSpain is a huge country of great\ncontrasts. In fact, many would claim\nthat it was in fact four or five\nseparate nations, which have always\nbeen hard to unify under one ruler.\nWave after wave of invaders have\nvisited this peninsula, the Romans\nand Visigoths leaving a predominantly Christian heritage\nuntil the Moors arrived, with the fire\nof Islam in their hearts, leaving an\ninfluence on the country hard to\nreconcile in Western Europe. The\nMoorish influence has left many\nmonuments of great beauty, and a love for water so characteristic of a desert people.\nFor many people, Spain is two\nweeks on the beach toasting\nthemselves, getting a few beers\ndown in the process. Unfortunately\nthey miss the heart of this beautiful\ncountry, that is still, perhaps, a bit\nof a mystery to us North Europeans.\nHere are a few places that catch\nsome of the flavour of the country.\nTOLEDO\nToledo is a stunning city, caught in\na bend of the raging River Tagus.\nThe medieval city remains intact\nbehind its walls, a blend of Moorish,\nChristian and Jewish architecture\nuntouched by time. Here Moorish\nand Christian kings ruled, building\nmagnificent monuments to their\nGods, with Christian architects\nbuilding mosques, and then later,\nMoorish architects building\nchurches. The Jewish influence is\nalso very strong, the city's two\nsynagogues containing fantastic,\nintricately carved interiors.\nA good time to wander the\nnarrow winding streets is late\nCathedral, Toledo\nafternoon, as the sunlight still\nbathes the golden buildings and\npeople begin to stir from their siesta\nafter the heat of the day. Stroll along\nthe walls, where El Cid once\nvanquished the Moors, or hide\naway in a cool, dark bar and sip at\na glass of sherry. Or, climb the\nnarrow streets to the top of the hill\nwhere the cathedral stands, one of\nthe most beautiful in Spain, which\nthrongs with people at all times,\npaying respects to their God.\nProbably the most famous\nresident of Toledo was El Greco, the\nGreek. This Cretan left his home\ncountry, came to Spain, and found\nin Toledo a new home and\ninspiration for his most famous\npaintings. Toledo is where most of\nhis pictures still remain, and it is\nonly here that you can experience\nthe luminous light that is so\ncharacteristic of his paintings.\nThe best place to stay in Toledo,\naway from the droves of tourists, is\nthe youth hostel, part of a castle\nfacing the city proper, with\nswimming pool included! And, the\nnight life is not at all bad; once the\ncoach loads of Americans have\ndeparted, the locals come out in\nforce and spend the night in\nnumerous bars tucked away in little\nalleys. I for one stayed in a bar until\n6am, and even then there was no\nsign of it closing.\nSANTIAGO DE\nC0MP0STELA\nSnuggled in the rich green hills of\nGalicia is the city of Santiago. The\ninhabitants of Galicia, the Gallegos,\nconsider themselves to be a separate\nrace, descended from the Celts. In\nfact Galicia, with its greene s s and\nsea airs is more reminiscent of\nBrittany and Cornwall than the\nburning heat of the heart of Spain.\nSantiago may have been the first\ntourist destination of all\u2014in the\nmiddle ages thousands of pilgrims\ncrossed Europe and Northern Spain\nto see the bones of St James\n(Santiago in Spanish), which were\nmiraculously rediscovered as the\nReconquista started. The holy relics\nthemselves are housed in the\nmagnificent Baroque cathedral, best\nseen as the setting sun lights up the\ngolden sandstone. If you are lucky,\nyou may see the enormous incense\nholder being swung the length of\nthe cathedral\u2014it takes eight priests\nto manage the thing!\nAnyway, for us mere mortals not\nup to a pilgrimage, a stroll through\nthe portico ed streets, stopping off at\na few bars for a glass of Riberio wine\nstraight from the cask should suffice\nfor an afternoon's entertainment.\nFor the more adventurous, try\nPulpo Gallego (octopus) or the\npimientos fried in butter (only one\nin ten is hot!).\nSantiago\nPage 10 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "t Letters\nLoans Demo\nBad Publicity\nDear Editor,\nI feel 1 must write in response to a letter which\nappeared in issue 820 on December 2. It is the\none concerned with the perception of the\napparent apathy of IC students in general\ntowards Student Loans.\nI, for one, am certainly not in favour of them. \u2022\nNeither do I feel total indifference towards the\nsubject. I believe that going on a demonstration.\nis everyone's right as we are living in a democracy. I grant you that the demonstration\nreceived widespread publicity, but so too did the\nnegative aspects of its latter stages. This will only\nserve to fuel criticism and unsubstantiated beliefs\nthat university students are hotheads and only\nlooking for trouble. I am sure that all those who\nsigned the letter wholeheartedly disapproved of\nthe events with the Police at the time of the\nmarch. I would be much happier, however, if I saw their signatures at the bottom of letters to\ntheir local MP, voicing their objections about\nStudent Loans, rather than seeing them in a letter\nto FELIX, which labels all IC students as'\napathetic. Such a letter might not seem a very\nstrong action or appear to have much impact, but\nif the 'thousands' who took part in the march\n'from as far afield as Dundee' did so then perhaps1 Kenneth Baker and his Parliamentarian\ncolleagues would pay more attention to the\nstudents' plight.\nAfter all, we live in a system where the MPs[\nare meant to act as our representatives when1 decisions concerning policies and laws are made..\nIt may not be 100% efficient but let us make the;\nmost of it and carry out some positive and\ndecisive action.\nYours,\nL Abati, Life Sci 2.\nAn Open Mind?\nDear Editor,\nSome of the issues facing us today are\nimportant for us to consider, however, I must say\nthat the 'Questions 88' discussion missed the\nmark by a mile. 'Questions 88' was an event\norganised by the IC Islamic Society two weeks\nago, in which they said they sought to compare\nthe three ideologies, Islam, Democracy and\nSocialism. The Muslim speaker, understandably\nheavily biased towards Islam, started his\ncomparison by equating socialism with\ncommunism and democracy with capitalism. If\nthis were really tbe case, then why have two\ndistinctly different words in the English language'\nto describe them? As most informed historians-would agree, the first signs of socialism are seen\nin early Jewish history, long before either Islamor communism were thought up. So it was put-to the speaker that perhaps a comparison of Islamand Judaism would be more appropriate here?\nThe speaker replied that Judaism was not 'away1 of life' and wasn't worth talking about, he\nwanted to talk about communism. So let us resign\nand allow him to have his way.\nFrom this position he proceeded to expound,\nhow, in its origins (ie not taking contemporary\nextensions into account) communism be lei ved in\nthe non-existence of God, and capitalism didn't care about God. However, as any visitor to\nAmerica would be able to verify, passed down\nfrom the American Constitutions (or 'creed' as\nthe speaker put it) all of the US money has\nprinted on it 'in God we trust'. It seems so\npointless to have a debate of this nature at\nImperial just so that a speaker can share his\nignorance with us.\nA 'Questions 88' leaflet asked 'Do You Have1\nAn Open Mind?'. Perhaps it would have been\nbetter phrased, do you have an open mouth? As\nthe speaker treated the debate in the way a mother would, force feeding her baby, waving\noff the pesky flies of communism and capitalism.\nBut then again can a Muslim have an open mind,\nas like the speaker said, their freedom lies in that\nif they disagree with something in Islam, they get\nthree days to argue about it, before they are put\nto death. In future, however, the Imperial College\nIslamic Society could perhaps invite a more\ninformed speaker, if they intend to compare Islam\nwith other ideologies.\nYours sincerely,\nKeith T Adeney, Elec Eng 3.\nWendy's Letter\nDear Bill,\nIt seems that I can no longer appear to be sitting\nsmugly in my Ivory Union Tower doing\nabsolutely nothing about students loans.\nI must confess that when first approached\nabout the mass lobby on Thursday 24 it was by\nindividuals associated with IC Socialist Worker\nSociety who in my view merely act as a front for\nthe SWP in a not always amenable manner. For\nthat reason, I was hesitant to attend the march.\nSince then I have spent a considerable amount\nof time digesting the White Paper, not just\nreading it, but making notes and considering the\nimplications of the finer details.\nThere are two stages of opposition to the\nscheme which can be taken; that of opposing the \u2022\n.principle or opposing the practicalities of the\nsystem.\nI do not suggest for one moment that the\nprinciple be accepted but that if all our eggs are\nin one basket, then a loans system may be\nimplemented which apart from anything else,\ntakes very little account of the cost of living in\nLondon.\nIt is therefore my intention to produce a paper\nfor submission to the Governing Bodies of both\nImperial and other London colleges highlighting\nthe effect the system will have on the quality of\nstudent life and ultimately the intake levels upon\nwhich they so heavily rely.\nThe main problem with London is that the\n'extra' loan facility on top of the 'full' value of\nthe grant will barely cover the loss of housing\nbenefit and that consequently students will still\nbe graduating with heavy bank overdrafts over\nand above their student loan. The Government's proposals for repayment of the loan will become\nsomewhat irrelevant when a student has a bank\nbreathing down his n^ ck, for quick repayment1 of an overdraft, perhaps in\"excess of the loan.\nIf London colleges and their students are not\n.o be discriminated against, an index-linked 'free'\nloan must be provided as well as the top-up loan\nto take account of inflated rents, travel, food,\ncosts, etc, otherwise the only students who will\nbe able to study in London will be those\nundertaking course that are guaranteed to\nprovide healthy salaries and give a high chance\nof obtaining sponsorships; the Royal College of\nScience will be worse hit by this.\nSo, perhaps in the future, those who think I couldn't be bothered to attend the march should\nperhaps come and speak to me so that our\nignorance of each other's activities and aims can\nbe remedied.\nYowrs,\nIan Morris, ICU Hon Sec.\nOn your bike\nHarry\nDear Bill,\nThank you for the feature about me in FELIX\nrecently. As a 'Character' at IC I believe I have\nwidened the concept of what is a Professional\nMathematician!!\nFELIX readers may be interested to know thai\nI used my techniques to obtain all the numbers\nup to 200 digits asked for by Keith Devlin in the\nGuardian Micro-Maths (17th Nov). His problem\nwas stated as: 527 degrees F is such that it\nbecomes 275 degrees C: so what is the next\nnumber with this property that the 5 moves from\nthe front to the back when you change from F to C. The next number with this property is 5294,\n111764,70588 F=2941,17647,05882,35275C. To determine all such numbers up to 200 digits\ntook .081 sec execution time and I 'll send you the\nprogram (all 21 lines of it) and output.\nHowever the reason for this letter is that I have\nbeen approached to take part in a Project that\nmight interest some IC students.\nBill Morgan is a stuntman who has featured in\nJames Bond films as well as others. He wants to\nmake the longest motorcycle jump and land in\nwater in London Docks and so get into the\nGuinness Book of Records. (His target is around\n,225 feet.) He has sponsorship from a French\nCircus which puts on dare-devil feats and\nChannel 4 TV is interested. He is not worried\nabout landing in the water at around 60 mph... T can have speed boats churning up the water so\nthat I land in foam...' What he wants to know\nabout is the dynamics involved.\nTreating the bike and Bill as a 'particle' (typical\nmathematical approximation!) he should lift off\nat 45 degrees (it will be from a ramp on a dock side), travelling at about 60 mph. The particle\nwill then rise to around 110 feet and plunge into\nlovely Thames Water. This is of course,\nneglecting..., neglecting...and what about...?\nAn accurate careful analysis of the whole event,\nincluding entry into the water, will not be easy\nand the 'show' is scheduled for later summer\n1989. What is being initially aimed for, if we can\nformulate the equations correctly, is a realistic\ngraphic visual computer simulation so that we\ncan see how Bill and his bike will fare as they fly\nthrough the air and enter the water.\nPage 2 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

Would you care for a cup\nof tea?'\nShe turned round and the most\n, peculiar sight met her eyes. There,\nin a clearing, stood a long wooden\ntable and around it sat three of the\nstrangest creatures she ever had\nseen. The voice spoke again.\nT asked if you would like a cup of\ntea?'\nIt belonged to a very curious\nlooking man with a long cloak and\na very silly hat. Alice remembered\nher manners\n'Thank you very much', she\nreplied courteously.\n'Well, you can't, we haven't any'\n'Then why did you ask me if I wanted some?' Alice retorted.\n'Well, you see, I am completely\nmad. Mad as a hatter. Indeed I am\na Mad-Hatter: Bill Madhatter at your\nservice'\nAnother voice rang out from the\nother side of the table.\n'He's not really a hatter', cried a rabbit-like creature with a mass of\nspiky hair, 'He used to run a newspaper, until he annoyed the\nKing of Heartless.'\n'Goodness Gracious! What did\nthe King do'\n'It was terrible. He cut off his Print\nUnit. Would you like a cup of tea?'\n'But you have no tea?'\n'Of course not, but its only polite\nto ask. Anyway, I am also\ncompletely mad. I'm Ian, the Mad\nMarch Haircut and this is Chas, the\nDormouse,'\nAnd with that, he hit the small,\nfurry, snoring creature sitting next\nto him. It woke up with a start.\n'What! Er, yes, er, no, of course\nI wasn't asleep. I never sleep. Good\nHeavens! who might you be?'\n'I'm Alice,' said Alice.\nT would offer you a cup of tea, but\nI'm afraid I'm sitting in the teapot'\nAlice looked, and indeed he was.\n'Hello.

I'm most\ndreadfully sorry, but, as you know,\nI'm as mad as a hatter.'\nAt that very moment, they heard\na trumpet call. The dormouse woke\nup with a start and hid in the teapot.\n'Quick!' shouted the hatter 'Stand\nup! Sit down! Kneel! Pray!! It's the\nKing.'\n'Curiouser and curio user,' thought Alice. At that very moment\nthe royal party thundered into the\nclearing, waving flamingos. The\nMarch Haircut bowed low.\n'Your Gracious Majesties,' he\ngrovelled, 'May this humble servant\nintroduce you to Alice.'\nAlice had always been taught to\nbe polite.\n'I'm very pleased to meet you,'\nshe said, and curtsied.\n'We should think so too. We are\nNigel, the King of Heartless, and\nthis is Fiona, the Queen'\n'Money!' the Queen spat out.\n'Give me money, money. Money\nfor blind people, ill people, children,\nanimals, RAG!'\nShe waved a can under Alice's nose. This was rather rude, Alice\nthought, although she didn't say so\nout loud. That would be even ruder.\n'Later Fiona, Later,' the King\ninterrupted, 'We wish to converse.'\nHe smiled sincerely, straightened\nhis crown and handed Alice a piece\nof paper.\n'We wish you to fill in the royal\nquestionnaire.'\nAlice looked at the piece of paper.\nIt was full of the most peculiar\nquestions.\n'Your Majesty!' exclaimed Alice,\nquite forgetting her manners, \"This\nis complete and utter nonsense'\nEveryone went quiet. The\nDormouse shivered inside his\nteapot. The Mad Hatter hid under\nhis silly cloak. The King went\npurple.\n'Off with her head! Off with her\nhead' he screamed.\nAlice stayed calm.\n'You cannot do that,' she retorted,\n'Its not allowed'\n'We can do as we want.' and the\nKing pulled out from under his\nrobes a large blue book.\n\"This is the book of all the rules of\nWonderland'. He waved it\ntriumph ally in the air.\n'Rule 41 clearly says that the King|\nis allowed to interpret the rules\nwhen the rules do not make sense'\n'BB But,' squeaked a tiny voice\nfrom inside the teapot, 'who decides!\nif the rules make sense or not'\n'We do, of course,' spat the King,\n'and we are rewriting all the rules\nso that none of them make sense.\nThis will make me the most'\npowerful person in Wonderland'.'\nHe was giggling manic ally and'\npointing at the teapot.)\n'Off with his spout' he cried.\nThe Royal Guards advanced on;\nAlice. \"This is very silly' she thought!\nand, saying goodbye as politely as j she could under the circumstances,\nshe started to run into the forest as\nfast as her legs would carry her. She I ran for miles and miles. She ran\nuntil her legs ached and she had to ]\nrest down under a gigantic\nmushroom.\n. She remembered this place: it was\nwhere she had first met the\ncaterpillar on her first visit to\nWonderland. Strangely enough,\nthere was no sign of the caterpillar\nnow. All that was left now was a: pile of paper plates and an uneaten j bowl of chilli.

Such a! peculiar mixed up place couldn't., possibly exist in reality, could it?'...j Ents\nTo end off the term, on Wednesday\nDecember 14, Ents are putting on a Christmas Party in association with\nThe Institut Francais (the French\nsecretarial school just down by\nSouth Ken tube station). It starts at\n8pm, featuring a disco, bar\nextension, the works and perhaps\neven some mince pies for the first\ngroups of people in. Tickets are\navailable from the Union Office (\u00a31\nadv, \u00a31.50 on the door, or free with\nan Ents card).\nAlso a quick note to tell you that\nwhen you do come back to College\nnext term, there's a Carnival on\nFriday January 13 to welcome you\nhome. The whole of the Union\nBuilding is being used, with bands,\ndiscos, comedy, theatre, casino,\nfilms, food and very late bar\nextensions (imagine Freshers' Week\ncrammed into one night!); look out\nfor details at the start of the new\nterm.\nBut what of the events that have\ngone on this term. Freshers' Week\nwas a resounding success, despite\nthe chaos caused by the postal strike\nThe New Years Party started off the\nyear, my particular favourites on the\nnight being The Muscle Shoal, but\nalso with excellent entertainment\nfrom from The Company She Keeps\nand Boys Wonder. The comedy night\nwas a storming evening, packed to\ncapacity and with Mark Thomas in\ndefinitely the best form I 've seen\nhim in. Finally, to end the week,\nThe Freshers' Ball. The Chevalier\nBrothers (now sadly demised)\ntopped the night, supported with\ndance sounds from African band\nTaxi Pata Pata, and homegrown\nband Dave, Puppy and the Happy Dogs\nand not forgetting the flurry of\ndiscos, films and drinking that also\nwent on all night.\nThe Silwood Bonfire Party was a hearty evening. After the bonfire\nand fireworks, and numbing\ncoldness, everybody went indoors\nto warm up and more importantly\nto see the Virginia Vagabounds, who's unique style of foot-stomping\ncountry and western sent all of the\ncrowd into a frenzy (we were in no\nway responsible for the other band\nthat evening).\nFinally, as a warm up to\nChristmas, The jets played last week,\nprobably the funniest and liveliest\nband I 've seen in College.\nAll that's left for me to do is\nremind you not to forget enjoying\nyourself next term and to say a huge\nword of thanks to everyone who\nhelped out this year.\nCheers, Paul Watkiss.\nPage20 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

You\ncan understand why if you try\ngetting into the kingdom by public\ntransport\u2014the mountains are quite\nan obstacle. The capital is Oviedo,\na rather dull city, nice cathedral. The\nreal reasons to visit Asturias are the\nmountains and the coast, along\nwhich a privately owned railway\ntrack runs. The scenery is\nwonderful, thousands of tiny rocky\ncoves washed by the Atlantic,\ninterspersed with the occasional\nfishing village, where the locals will\ngreet you with warmth. The\nwonderful thing about Asturias is\nthat only the Spanish go there on\nholiday, and there aren't many of\nthem even! (The Atlantic is quite\nwarm here as well.)\nBe sure to try Sidra Asturiana\nwhile you are visiting, just like\nscrum py, except for the customary\nmethod of serving it.

    "content": "The Rules\nBRIEF IDEA OF THE GAME\nThe idea of the game is to buy and rent\nproperties so inefficiently and un profitably that\nplayers lose any wealth they may start the\ngame with. The first player to lose all his money\nbecomes The Biggest Tit In College. When a player's token lands on some exorbitantly overpriced and badly situated property, he must\npurchase it from the College Loan Account,\nhereafter referred to as 'The Bank'. The object\nof purchasing property is to collect rents and\nlose money. Under no circumstances should\nany player attempt to reduce the rents on\ntheir properties to a reasonable level; this\nis cheating. Players are advised that\ninefficiency wins in this game.\nRentals are greatly increased by building\nhouses and hotels on the sites. This is an\nobligatory requirement.\nPlayers may note that 'Fisher Hall' is not\npresent on the board. Fisher Hall is the only site\non which a player may theoretically purchase\nthe site and then not build a house, or charge\nrent, for several game turns.\nPlayers may not mortgage their sites unless\nthey have less than \u00a3100. At this point they\nmay take a ridiculously high loan from The Bank\nwhen mortgaging their sites.\nCollege Cock-ups and Union Upsets give\ninstructions that must be followed.\nSometimes players land in a tutorial.\nThe game is one of shrewd and amusing\ntitration suitable for those of an unstable\ndisposition.\nEQUIPMENT\nPlayers may have noticed a surprising,\nsimilarity between the game of 'Monopoly' by\nJohn Waddington Ltd and the infinitely superior\ngame of 'Mammopoly'. This mere coincidence\nallows players to utilise the money, houses,\nhotels, dice and tokens available in the\naforementioned 'Monopoly' game. Players may\nlike to steal the communal Hall copy of\n'Monopoly', ransacking it for the relevant\npieces. It has been calculated that the ensuing\ndrop in weight of the 'Monopoly' box should\ncorrespond to the contents of approximately\ntwo Southside Bar ashtrays. Using this\ningenious decoy device, players should be able\nto return the vandalised 'Monopoly' game to\ntheir Hall Porter without fear of reprisal*.\nPlayers are provided with a game board\nwhich bears a cunning similarity to the College\nHalls of Residence system. Again this is a mere\ncoincidence and is completely unintentional.\nPlayers are also provided with two sheets of\nTitle Deeds which should be cut out with\nparental assistance.\nFELIX accepts no 'esp on sitH l tv 'of ef v action taken with te gard to\nthe Mammopoiy game, ot the rules contained therein\nPREPARATION\nPlace the board on a good-sized table, as are\nfound in the Union Bar or Southside Bar. Each\nplayer is provided with one token to represent\nhim on his travels around the board. Each player\nis also given the amazing sum of \u00a31,500. All\nother equipment goes on 'The Bank'. One of\nthe players (the least trustworthy) is elected\nBanker, while another is elected 'Dork'. The\npurpose of the 'Dork' is to provide adequate\nalcoholic beverages to make the game\nenjoyable.\nMONEY\nEach player is given \u00a31,500 divided as\nfollows: two \u00a3500-four \u00a3100-one \u00a350-one\n\u00a320-two \u00a310-one \u00a35\u2014five \u00a31's. All remaining Monopoly money goes to 'The\nBank'.\nThe 'Dork' may require some real money in\norder to perform his task. As the game\nprogresses, and the beverages flow, the 'Dork'\nis more likely to accept Monopoly money as\npayment. This will cause much hilarity when\nhe is told by the bar staff exactly where he\nshould go. {This will not be to 'Tutorial' and in\nany case he should not pass 'New Term' and\nwill not collect \u00a3200 Top-up Loan.)\nTO START THE GAME\nStarting with the Banker, each player in turn\nthrows the dice. The player with the lowest\ntotal starts play. He/she/Jason Lander places\nhis/her/its token on the corner marked 'New\nTerm', throws two dice land probably his\nstomach later on in the game l and moves his\ntoken clockwise around the board by the\nnumber of spaces indicated by the dice. After\nhe has completed his play, the turn of play\npasses to the left. Note that one or more tokens\nmay rest on the same space at the same time,\nalthough the last player to land on the space\nmay be required to take a suitable penalty, such\nas being the 'Dork'.\nAccording to the space upon which his token\nreaches, a player may have to buy Building\nSites or properties (obligatory if the player has\nthe money available)\u2014or be obliged to pay rent\nl if another owns the property l, pay Poll Tax,\nplay 8 College Cock-up or Union Upset, 'Go to\nTutorial', etc.\nIf a player throws a double he earns himself\nanother turn. This may be thought of as dealing\nbehind the back of certain College officials\nwhile they are out at lunch, on holiday, etc.\nHowever, if three such doubles are thrown in\na row, the player has been discovered and must\npay for his heinous cri nie by attending a tutorial.\nEvery time that a player's token either lands\non or passes over 'New Term', while going\nclockwise around the board, the Banker, acting\non behalf on our old mate Ken Baker, hands him\nthe generous sum of \u00a3200 as a 'Top-up Loan'.\nLANDING ON UNOWNED\nPROPERTY\nWhen a player lands on an un owned property\n(i.e., on a Building Site for which no other player\nholds the Title Deed), whether by a throw of\nthe dice or by a move forced by the instruction\nof a College Cock-up or Union Upset, and he\nholds enough money to buy the site, that player\nmust purchase it. For this he recieve s a handsome Title Deed card showing ownership\nwhich he places face-up in front of him. Note\nthat all sites bought must be declared in this\nway, however dod gy or em barra sing the\ntransaction was.\nLANDING ON OWNED PROPERTY\nWhen a player lands on owned property,\neither by a throw of dice, or by a move forced\nby a College Cock-up or Union Upset, the\nowner collects rent from him in accordance\nwith the list printed on the Title Deed card\napplying to it. A/ of e. lf the site contains a House\nor Houses, the rent is exorbitantly higher than\nit would be for an un improved Site, if the Site\nis mortgaged, no rent can be collected. Double\nrent cannot be collected from a Pattern-Group\nif one site is mortgaged. Mortgaged property\nis designated by turning the Title Deed\nrepresenting that property upside down.\n/Vofe.lf the player fails to give his rent before\nthe next throw of the dice, he becomes the new\n'Dork'.\nADVANTAGES FOR OWNERS\nIt is an advantage to hold Title Deeds for all\nSites of a complete Pattern-Group (for example\nOlave House and 170 Queensgate) because the\nowner may then charge double rent for\nun improved Sites of that property. This is yet\nanother ingenious device for screwing rent out\nof unwilling residents.\nHouses can only be built on Sites of a complete Pattern-Group owned (see\nHOUSES)\nLANDING ON COLLEGE COCK UP\nOR UNION UPSET'\nA player thi ow s the two dice twice and sums\nthe total of the four throws. The result is then\napplied to the table of College Cock-ups or\nUnion Upsets given on the Mammopoly board.\nThe instructions given are then followed. The\n'Get out of Tutorial Free' instruction must be\nremembered until used After being used it\nmust be promptly forgotten. This memorized\ninstruction may be sold to another player at a price agreeable to both. In this case the memory\nof the 'Get out of Tutorial Free' instruction must\nbe transferred between players. In light of the\nabove complications, it may be de eem ed wise\nto record 'Get Out of Tutorial Free' instructions\nusing a pencil and paper.\nLANDING ON FREE PARKING\nWhen a player lands on this Space, one of the\nOther players must pretend to be Nigel, our\nbeloved Union President. The lucky player then\nhas to grovel to 'Nigel' in the most appropriate\nmanner until he is given the Free Parking Permit\nhe so des per at fy requires. If he fails in this task,\nhe will have to park his car round the back of\nthe Old Chemistry Building.\nBANKER\nSelect as Banker a player who is the most\nuntrustworthy, low down piece of cow dung\naround the table.\nTHE BANK\nThe Banker preferably uses for the Bank a pint glass placed at his elbow, but in practice\nit will be found that the banker becomes quite adept at using his pockets. In this case, he\nshould become the 'Dork'.\nIf the Bank (College Loan Account) runs out\nof money, a very sorry state of affairs, the\nBanker must issue I.O. U.'s for whatever\namounts are required.\nTUTORIAL\nA player lands in Tutorial if his token lands\non the space marked 'Go to Tutorial', or if he\nthrows doubles three times in succession.\nNote: A player will not recieve \u00a3200 Top-up\nLoan on his way to a Tutorial for being a Girly\nSwot.\nA player gets out of a Tutorial\u2014{1) By throwing a double on his next turn. If he\nsucceeds, he can throw again and move\nforward the appropriate (or inappropriate)\nnumber of spaces. (2) Using his memory of a previous 'Get Out of Tutorial Free' instruction.\n(3) By completing Quantum Mechanics Problem\nSheet 3 before his next turn.\nSkiving a Tutorial: If a player is not 'sent\nto Tutorial', but in the ordinary course of play\nreaches that space, he is 'Just Skiving' and has\nmanaged to avoid yet another boring,\nincomprehensible tutorial. Well done.\nHOUSES\nHouses can be bought only from the Bank\nand can only be built on Sites of a complete\nPattern-Group which the player owns. If he\nbuys one House, he may place it on any Site\nwithin the Pattern-Group. The next house he\nbuys must then be built on a different site:\nproperties must be developed evenly\nthroughout the game. The price paid for houses\nis given on the Title Deed cards for each Site.\nA player must, if his financial standing allows,\nbuild at least one house every turn.\nHOTELS\nA player must have four Houses on each Site\nof a complete Pattern-Group before building a Hotel. The Hotel is bought from the Bank for\nthe sum shown on the Title Deed plus the four\nhouses already on the Site. Only one hotel may\nbe built on any one site.\nSELLING PROPERTY\nUndeveloped sites and Refectones/Bars may\nbe sold to any player as a private transaction\nonly when the seller has less than \u00a3100. No\nSite, however, may be sold to another player\nif buildings are standing on any Sites in that\nPattern-Group. Any buildings so situated must\nbe sold back to the Bank before the owner can\nsell any Site of that Pattern-Group. Mortgaged\nproperty cannot be sold to the Bank -only to\nother players.\nHouses and Hotels may be resold to the Bank\nat anytime that the owner has less than \u00a3100.\nIn this case the Bank will pay one half of the\nprice paid for them. In the case of Hotels, the\nBank will pay half the cash price of the Hotel\nplus half the price of the four Houses which\nwere given in purchase of the Hotel.\nMORTGAGES\nMortgaging properties can be done through\nthe Bank only when the owner has less than\n\u00a3 100 ready cash. The mortgage value is printed\non each Title Deed. The rate of interest is 10%,\npayable when the mortgage is lifted. If any\nproperty is transferred which is mortgaged, the\nnew owner may lift the mortgage at once if he\nwishes, but he must pay the 10% interest.\nHouses or Hotels cannot be mortgaged. All\nbuildings on a Site must be sold to the Bank\nbe j ore that Site can be mortgaged.\nBuilding cannot proceed on mortgaged\nproperty.\nBANKRUPTCY\nWhen a player is bankrupt, he must sell any\nproperty he owns in an attempt to raise money.\nIf even this attempt (jails, he is deemed the\nwinner, and must buy a round of drinks, even\nif he is not the current 'Dork'.\nRULES FOR PLAYING THE SHORT\nGAME\nIf time is short and optimum fun is required,\nthe following rule may be applied... Every time\na player pays rent, he must down a pint of a suitable beverage.\nof Mammopoly\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\ngood for society because it helps to\neliminate disability. But can\neliminating disability at the expense\nof eliminating the disabled really be\ncalled a good thing? Scientific\nresearch and the development of\nnew surgical techniques provide far\nmore effective means of doing this.\nRape is another situation often\ncited as a justifications for abortion.\nAlthough it is a terrible crime\ndeserving of severe punishment, is\nit right to kill the innocent unborn\nchild who may be conceived?\nAn important point is made in the\nbook 'New Perspectives on Human\nAbortion', in which psychologists\nMahkorn and Dolan state that in the\nIf you are at all\nsquirm ish skip the\nnext six paragraphs\ncase of rape victims who become\npregnant, '...the pregnant victim's problems stem more from the\ntrauma of the rape than from the\npregnancy itself.'\nIn the long run it is often found\nthat the abortion is self-defeating in\nthe sense that it may give the\nmother more emotional problems\nthan if she'd gone the full term and\nhad the baby adopted. In actual fact\nthere is now a recognised condition\ncalled Post-Abortion Syndrome. It\nis akin to the disorder shown by\nVietnam veterans who repressed\ntheir experiences then, years later\nshowed emotional problems.\nSymptoms include recurrent\ndreams of the abortion or unborn\nchild, reduced capacity for feeling or\nexpressing emotions and guilt.\nA very common pro-abortion\nargument is to simply assert that it\nis 'a woman's right to choose'. In\nmany issues, this sort of assertion\nis perfectly justifiable. However, it\nis not logical to extend this\nargument to the case of abortion\nwhere the 'rights' of the unborn\nchild must also be taken into\naccount. Genetically,\nphysiologically and organically the\nfoetus is distinct from the mother.\nSurely the unborn child's 'right to\nlife' exceeds the mother's 'right to\nchoose'.\nIt is also true to say that whilst the\nmother and father had the 'right to\nchoose' to prevent the mother from\nbecoming pregnant, they didn't exercise their right. After\nconception, the 'right to choose' no\nlonger exists.\nThe Methods\nThere are three main methods of\ncarrying out an abortion. The first\ninvades the uterus from below; the\nsecond involves the use of drugs\nwhich poison the unborn child and\nthen empty the uterus through\nsubsequent labour and delivery. The\nthird invades the uterus from above.\nAll three methods are quite\nnauseating and if you are at all\nsqueamish, I would suggest that\nyou skip the next six paragraphs.\nHowever do note that these\nmethods are used to carry out over\n170,000 abortions every year in\nEngland and Wales, and their\nbarbarity does in itself constitute an\nargument against abortion.\nIn the first category falls the\nSuction-Aspiration method. This is\nthe most commonly used technique.\nIt involves the insertion of a hollow\nplastic tube\u2014which has a knife like edge around the top\u2014into the\nuterus. The suction from this tube\nis about 30 times as powerful as a home vacuum cleaner and so tears\nthe baby's body to pieces. The\nplacenta is cut from the inner wall\nof the uterus and the scraps sucked\nout into a bottle.\nThe Dilatation and Curettage\nmethod. This method is similar to\nthe suction method except that the\nabortionist inserts a curette, a loop-shaped steel knife, into the uterus.\nWith this the placenta and foetus are\ncut into pieces and scraped out into\na basin. Bleeding is usually profuse.\nThe third 'blow uterus' method is\ncalled Dilitation and Evacuation. As\nthis method is used in later months,\na pliers-like instrument is needed\nbecause the baby's bones and skull\nhave calcified. There is no\nanaesthetic for the baby. The Doctor\ninserts the instrument up into the\nuterus, si eze s a leg or other part of\nthe body and, with a twisting\nmotion, tears it from the baby's body. This is repeated again and\nagain. The spine must be snapped\nand the skull crushed in order to\nremove them. The nurse's job is to\nreassemble the body parts to be sure\nthat all have been removed.\nIn the second category is the\nProstaglandin abortion. This\ninvolves the injection of the human\nNo civilised society\ncan justify abortion on\nthe grounds that it is\ncheaper to abort than\nto care\nhormone Prostin E2 which results in\nviolent labour and the delivery of\nwhatever size baby the mother is\ncarrying. The baby is usually too\nsmall to survive the traumatic\nlabour.\nThe most common third category\nabortion is the Hysterectomy. This\nis similar to an early Caesarean\nsection. The mother's abdomen is\nsurgically opened, as is her uterus.\nThe baby is then lifted out with the\nplacenta discarded. This method is\nused particularly in the case of late\npregnancies.\nAlternatives\nOnce again we ask ourselves why\nattitudes have changed so much\nsince the statement by the World\nMedical Federation in 1949 which\nquoted earlier. Forty years ago,\nabortion was not acceptable to most\npeople. Now it has become almost\ncommonplace. I don't say this\nlightly. In 1987, 174,246 abortions\nwere carried out in England and\nWales and the number is rising\nevery year.\nOne main reason for the\nwidespread acceptability of abortion\nis its legality. The Abortion Act was\npassed in 1967 and allows abortions\nto be carried out on both 'medical'\nand 'social' grounds. Reading the\ntranscripts of the debates which\ntook place in Parliament at the time,\nit is hard not to notice the stress\nplaced upon the point that this bill\n\u2022was only intended for so-called\n'hard cases' eg severely disabled\nfoetuses, victims of rape. There was\nno intention to introduce Abortion\non Demand. However the legal\ninterpretation of the act has\nproduced just this. A survey of\nGynaecologists in 1988 GALLUP\nshowed that 72% had found that\n'abortion on demand' existed in\nsome of the NHS hospitals in which\nthey had worked. 83% considered\nit to be available in the private (free-charging) sector.\nThere is additionally a belief that\nlegality implies moral correctness.\nWould we accept this argument as\na justification of apartheid in South\nAfrica?\nAnother reason for its\nacceptability is the prevalent\nignorance of the issues involved.\nMost students are much better\ninformed a bot nuclear disarmament,\napartheid and ecological matters.\nWhat you don't know about you\ncan't take issue with.\nAt Imperial College it is the society\ncalled PATA which campaigns on\nthese on these pro-life issues. The\ninitials PATA stand for Positive\nAlternatives To Abortion. As the\nname suggests, we are not solely\nnegative in our approach to\nabortion. We also wish to stress that\nthere are alternatives to abortion\nand that there are things which can\nbe done to lessen the need for\nabortion.\nThe main alternative to abortion\nis adoption. For many years the\ndemand to adopt has been very\ngreat. According to the British\nAdoption and Fostering agency,\nthere are at least 100 applications per\nbaby available for adoption. It is\nperversely ironic that while such a demand to have a child to love and\ncare for exists, over 170,000 unborn\nchildren are being aborted annually.\nAlthough the use of contraception\nmay help to prevent parents from\nresorting to abortion, the fact that no\ncontraceptive is 100% effective must\nalso be taken into account. Even if\na human life has been created\nunintentionally then the only moral\nchoice is to proceed with the\npregnancy. It should also be noted\nthat some contraceptives are\nactually abortion devices as they\nartificially prevent the fertilised\nembryo from lodging in the womb.\nThe best way to reduce the\ndemand for abortion is to find the\nreasons and then to address them.\nOne main reason is the financial\nburden of bringing up children. This\nfactor is particularly relevant in the\ncase of the disabled.\nA solution to this problem is for\nsociety to put a greater emphasis on\nhelping to share this burden.\nPragmatically, this means that\npublic opinion should encourage\ngovernment to give greater support\nto those with children. Facilities for\nthe disabled should also be better\nfunded.\nEven if the result of this may be\nslightly higher taxes, surely this\nwould be a small price to pay for a more caring and civilised society.\n200 A graph\n150\n100\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 23\n\n"

The\nevents of the meeting were\ndescribed by a spokesman from\nULU as 'dramatically disturbing to\nthe general position of the Union'.\nAn initial motion of censure,\nwhich labelled Mr Jackson as\n'incompetent', was proposed by\nSimon Aldis, co-President of the\nSchool of Oriental and African\nStudies Union (SOAS) and was\npassed convincingly. A subsequent\nam mend ment, proposed by Chris\nMassey, the Senator for Medicine to\nthe GUC, proposed a 'no-confide nc ing' of Mr Jackson.\nMr Massey, discharged himself\nfrom hospital where he was\nreceiving treatment for a painful\ntendon injury, to be at the meeting.\nWhen his motion failed by a margin\nof 2%, he resigned in tears,\nbelieving this to be the honorable\nline of action.\nThe motion came after weeks of\ndisquiet among executive committee\nmembers, who claimed to be 'totally\noutraged over Stuart Jackson's lack\nof action', particularly with respect\nto the march over student loans, his\ndisregard for his Vice-President's, and his failure to provide briefings\nfor members of the Executive,\nSenate and other representatives,\non the meetings they were to\nattend.\nFears about his inadequacy came\nto a head at the NUS conference,\nwhen Mr Jackson arrived four hours\nlater than the other members of the\nExec, and proceeded to listen to his\npersonal stereo for the remaining\ntime.\nIn the 'no-confidence' motion\nwhich followed there were 56 votes\nin favour, 32 against and 1\nabstention. In order for a President\nto be ousted a two-thirds majority\nin favour of the motion is required.\nThe motion failed by two votes, the\nrequired figure being 58.\nThe narrow margin in the voting\nhas prompted a call for Mr Jackson\nto resign from a number of colleges,\nm clu dr ng SOAS, King's, LSE, UCL,\nThe London School of Pharmacy\nand St George's Medical School.\nA number of representatives from\nImperial voted against the motion,\nand Mr Jackson has written to Nigel\nBaker, ICU President, to thank him\nfor his support.\nMr Jackson told FELIX he thought\nthe motion was a 'personal\nconspiracy' against him. He said\nthat the Exec's accusations oi\ninadequacy were 'a smoke screen\nfor political and personal\ndifferences'. He said their\n'mouthing, banal left-wing\nstatements' would not prevent him\nfrom continuing in office as 'one of\nthe few conservatives who has\nmade an effort to work with\nstudents who follow robotic, left-wing violence.'\nHe claimed that although the\nStudents' Union is against him, he\nhas 'a large amount of respect from\nthe University itself. T will not\nleave,' he concluded, 'they'll have\nto drag me kicking and s cree ming out of my office.\nExecutive members and\nrepresentatives of a number of\nstudent unions in ULU remain\npessimistic about the remainder of\nhis time in office. A spokesman for\nSOAS told FELIX, 'his disregard for\npublic relations and his ceaseless\nability to open his mouth before he\nthinks, will lead to trouble'. They\nhope to remove some of Mr\nJackson's responsibilities from him\nand claim that, if no change is seen,\nthey will attempt a no-confidence\nmotion again, possibly in the near\nfuture.\nICU vote for action on\nStudent Loans\nA motion calling for the Union\nExecutive to present a petition\nagainst student loans to MP's at a Parliamentary lobby on January 19\nwas passed at Thursday's Emergency Gene: meting. The\nmotion also called foi .he Union to\norganise a half day strike, subject to\ndepartmental ballots, which would\nenable students to attend the lobby\nand to regularly liaise with the\nNational Uni if Students (NUS).\nUnder the motion, the IC Union\nPresident, Nigel Baker, has been\n' mandated to write to the Secretary\n. of State for Education explaining the\n. reasons for the action taken by IC .\nUnion.\nSpeaking in favour of the motion,\nproposer Julian Moore said that the\nintroduction of Student Loans was\nan admission by the Government\nthat student grants were too low.\nHe added that the loss of benefits\nwhich will accompany the\nintroduction of loans will cost\nstudents \u00a31000 a year, according to\nNUS figures.\nA second motion, suggesting that\nLondon students should receive an\nextra \u00a3270 in the final year and \u00a3360\nin other years was also discussed\n_ passed. The motion also,\nsuggested ii u:.. system of housing\nsupport should be established to\ncompensate for the loss of housing\nbenefit in London, and stated that\nthe Union 'does not, in any way\nendorse the principle of Student\nLoans.'\nUnder the terms of the motion,\nthe President is mandated to discuss\nthese issues at the Governing Body\nand to ask the Governers for their\nsupport.\nThe Union hope to be able to\narrange an open debate between a number of MP's on the Loans Issue\nrt the start of next term.\nFinance\nforces quick\nmerger\ndecision\nThe proposed merger of IC with\nRoyal Holloway and Bedford New\nCollege (RHBNC) now looks more\nlikely to go ahead, following a review of their Chemistry\nDepartment.\nThe review was carried out ir\nresponse to a recent report by the\nUniversity Grants Committee\n(UGC). It concluded that the\nDepartment would in no way satisfy\nthe size criteria recommended in the\nUGC report even if its staff and\nstudent levels were to reach the\noptimistic targets set by the College.\nIn order to avoid closure, the\nDepartment's only viable line of\naction lies in a merger with IC,\naccording to the Head of Chemistry\nat RHBNC. Staff at Royal Holloway\nclaim that such an event would lead\nto Chemistry students from IC being\ntransferred to RHBNC, thus\nswelling their department.\nRHBNC face increasing problems\nwith their plans to raise the money\nnecessary to implement a merger. If\nthey are able to sell the land they\nown on the opposite side of the A30\nthey will no longer have the room\nnecessary to house IC students. As\nthis is the main advantage of a merger to IC, it seems the land will\nhave to be retained.\nThe RHBNC Council also\nintended to raise a large sum of\nmoney from the sale of their world-famous picture collection, but the\nhandling of dic uss ions about such\na sale resulted in a large amount of\nharmful press exposure. As a result\nthe possible sale of certain pictures\nhas had to be postponed until\nMarch next year, at the earliest, to\nallow public interest to quiet en. The main buildings of RHBNC are\npresently undergoing a large\nstructural survey, the result of\nwhich is likely to demand expensive\nbuilding. They are also in the\nprocess of building a new library to\nreplace the present 'porta cabin' housing. This project alone is\nexpected to cost \u00a32.9 million at\nJanuary 1988 prices. The elusive\nworking party is reported to have\nalready drafted an initial report on\nthe possibility of a merger, but has\nofficially postponed its release date\nto the end of January. RHBNC\nCouncil have, however, announced\nthat a decision whether to merge\nshould definitely be made by the\nend of the academic year.\nPage 6 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nWays Out of the Arms Race:\nSolutions to a Problem\n'Ways out of the arms race?'\nThe man stared nervously at the\nun blinking video camera.\n'I 've really no idea.' He recently\nwon a Nobel prize, and was still not\nused to persistent reporters. 'Thats\nwhy I'm here as a matter of fact.'\nThis answer was typical of about\nhalf the people asked at our recent\nInternational Scientists' Congress\nheld here at Imperial College. The\nother half were people from\nweapons labs, from universities,\ndefence organisations, from think\ntanks, peace groups and Research\nInstitutes who are often specialised\nin explaining why their own\nspecialty is the Way Out. So\nStrategic Defence Initiative (SDI)\nadvocates (add mitte d ly thin on the\nground these days) would claim that\nthe way forward is to build 100%\neffective defenses, then with\nmissiles obsolete and impotent, get\nrid of them. Arms control experts\nwould claim that you need treaties,\nyou can verify them, and build in\nstability in arms reductions. Some\npeace groups would unilaterally\nrenounce the need for nuclear arms,\nand then hope that what used to be\ncalled the Evil Empire would do the\nsame.\nOf course, these days, it's all\npretty much a state of flux, what\n\u2022with President Gorbachev's 'Christmas Present' - the heralding\nof a 'New Era' - as our national\nthe demos were\norganised by\ntwo Nobel Prize\nwinners\npress breathlessly put it. But the\nthree examples of 'Ways Out of the\nArms Race' given above delineate\nthe range of views held by most\npeople, and most people who came\nto our Congress.\nWhat characterises all three ideas\nis the need for an assessment on\nhow smart they really are as plans.\nSo if one could prove scientifically\nthat SDI will not work because of\nO level physics reasons, then you\ncould safely ignore the SDI\nadvocates (maybe looking for their\nvested interests in being advocates)\nand seek your solution to the arms\nrace elsewhere. If one could prove\nthat verification of a Comprehensive\nTest Ban would not be possible,\nperhaps for geophysical reasons,\nthen one could discount the second\noption. The third option is rather\nmore difficult, since one is dealing\nwith people rather than physics.\nHowever it is worth exploring, and\nit is here that scientists have a major\nrole to play.\nIn our conference we had Robert\nMcNamara and Richard Garwin\ndebunking the Star Wars mythology\nwith a mixture of their hard - nosed\npragmatism and O level physics.\nJosie Stein described the dirty deeds\nof Star Wars advocates, who\nsuppressed contrary experimental\nevidence, and told lies to their\nfunding agencies. To balance these\nthree Americans we had Secretary\nGeneral Gorbachev's space and\npolicy advisor Roald Sagdeev tell us\nof the likely Soviet response to a continuing SDI implementation. It\nis quite clear that in SDI, as in all\nforms of warfare, one has to take the\nopponent into account. We had\nthirty other experts talking about\ntheir specialties: the role of British\nand French weapons, the\nverification of treaties, the arms race\nat sea, the arms race and sexuality, -conventional force reductions,\nmodels of stability. We had forty\nposters on weapons and war\nresearch.\nThe announced Soviet force\nreductions were hinted at by many\nof our speakers from the Eastern\nbloc, who also predicted progress in\nchemical weapon treaty-making\nsoon. We had speakers discuss\nother technological developments\nwhich should interest us all: K. Subramanyam argued his case that\ndeveloped countries, in seeking to\nlimit developing countries from\nacquiring the bomb, were being\nmore than slightly hypocritical if\nalso continuing to proliferate new\ntechnologies. Our talks did not\navoid controversy: Subramanyam\nhad to justify his government's nuclear position to understandably\nconcerned Pakistanis in the\naudience. A letter was sent to\nBenazir Bhutto congratulating her\ndecision to scrap Pakistan's nuclear\nweapon program, if or when she\nfinds that it exists.\nWe had a demonstration to the\nIraqi Embassy, protesting their\nproven use of horrific chemical\nweapons against Kurds. We had\nanother to the Israeli Embassy,\nprotesting their imprisonment of\nMordechai Vanunu, who revealed\nthe 'secrets' of the Israeli nuclear\narsenal to the Sunday Times. We\neven had our own police escort, but\nthen the demos were organised by\ntwo Nobel prize winners.\nIt was an extra or d in airy time for\na Congress, given Gorbachev's initiatives, developments in new\narmaments, and the extra or d in airy changes in the nature and public\nperception of the threat. The\nprimary aim was not to attract press:\nlet's be honest, 550 scientists sitting\naround talking is not intrinsically\nnews-worthy. However, we had\nabout 100 press organisations and\nindividuals come. We had ten\ntelevision companies taking film.\nMore important is the mood of those\nparticipants. Whether they work in\nthe field of arms control, or were\njust interested bystanders, they\nwent away from Imperial College\nfeeling refreshed, re vitali sed having\nlearnt new things and made many\ncontacts. They had had their ideas\nchallenged, and maybe even had\nnew ones. Congress telephones\nhave not stopped ringing: the MOD\nasking how many of 'their people'\nwent: Novosti, AP, TASS and UPI\nwanting a speech from somebody\nwho built bombs.\nMany people helped this\nCongress, and they deserve our\nthanks. Bill Goodwin crawled out of\nbed at the ghastly hour of 10 am to\nhelp us copy speeches for a clam our ing world press.\nIan Morris and Nigel Baker helped\nus to set up our exhibition of arms\ncontrol posters in the JCR. We had\nenthusiastic and vital help from\nTariq Ali, Michelle Clarke, Sarah\nConyers, Ian Cormack, Rebecca\nCowley, Clare Davis, Rachel\nDowling, James Durrant, Gordon\nEdge, Ina El-Kadhi, Frank\nFederman, Natalia Karapanagioti,\nMartin Kinsey, Sam Lee, Zahid\nMalik, Thomas Manzocchi, Gregory\nMarkonizos, David Marshall,\nGeorge Mitsioulis, Christine Mollet,\nJoachim Muller, Rakes Muthoo,\nVicky Phillips, Mike Plummer,\nFarzana Saeed, Gunter Siddiqi,\nNaeem Siddiqi, Peter Sidley, Lara\nSherwin, Chris Veal, Hans\nViehmann and Angeles Vorvolakos.\nOne important thing seems to be\nthat East and West are talking to\neach other increasingly and over an\never-widening range of issues.\nPerhaps a more important thing is\nthat North and South are beginning\nto do the same: the tensions caused\nby the inequalities in the Developed\nand Developing Worlds are more\nand more being seen as the primary\ncauses of the many wars since the\nSecond World War, since nuclear\nweapons began keeping the peace.\nThe aims of the Congress continue,\nand indeed are sharpened by the\nthe MoD asking\nhow many of 'their\npeople' went\ndevelopments of this week. The\nThird International Congress is\nalready germinating.\nWays Out of the Arms Race? At\nour Congress, we did not\nnecessarily provide any single\nsolution, but we hope that maybe it\nwas part of a solution.\nHOW WE\nGOT OUT\nOF THE\nARMS RACE\n(or made our best attempt)\nPage 26 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nThe Meaning of Life\nIs there any scientific alternative to\nthe traditional conflicting ideas of\nevolution and the futility of life? To\nwhat purpose are we evolving?\nHow?\nOn Sunday December 4 a conference discussing 'Evolution,\nScience and Spirituality' was held\nby the Theosophical Society at the\nInstitute of Complementary\nMedicine.\nRupert Sheldrake, described as\n'the most controversial scientist on\nEarth', has spent the last ten years\nconsidering the subject. He has\nstudied natural sciences at\nCambridge and philosophy at\nHarvard, and holds a PhD in\nbiochemistry. He has contributed a regular column to The Guardian and\nwritten in The New Scientist, as well\nas being the author of two books;\nThe Presence of the Past and A New\nScience of Life.\nAccording to Sheldrake eternity\nand evolution are two theories often\nthought to be working at cross-purposes. Eternity describes a state\nwhereby the laws of nature never\nchange, as illustrated by physics and\nchemistry. Hence the term\n'discovery' when a new hypothesis\nis made; it is assumed that there is\na set of static laws of nature, all of\nwhich we will one day know.\nEvolution describes a state of affairs\nsuch that laws develop continually,\nillustrated by geology and biology.\nEverything is headed for a final\nculmination when the ultimate\npurpose or 'Omega Point' is\nreached, the exact dimensions of\nwhich have not been formulated.\nDr Sheldrake the or is es that the\ntwo interplay, and redefines them\nas 'Habit and Creativity'.\nHabit\nThis proclaims that everything\nbelongs to a level of organisation,\nthe broad categories of which are\nroughly as fig 2.\nfig 1\nIt is such that the whole system is\nmore than the sum of the parts. This\ncan be idealised as in Figure 1.\nEach system has its own 'm orphic field' which perpetuates habits,\nthemselves altered slightly by\nindividuals so that they are\nexternally changing.\nThe oscillator y rhythms inherent\nin all of us produce these 'm orphic fields', eg sleeping and waking,\nmenstrual cycles, molecular\nvibrations, heartbeats, etc. Morphic\nfields in effect link everything about\nus together and organise the form\nand shape of each system. These\nm orphic fields are not created by\neternal laws; they depend on the\nforms of previous similar systems.\nuniverse\nt galaxy\n\u2022\nsuns and planets\n*\necosystems\ni animal relationships\nt individuals\nt molecules\nt atoms\nt superstring s etc.\nfig 2\nDr Sheldrake explained that the\nm orphic fields contain an inherent\nmemory of all that has happened.\nWhen something occurs for the first\ntime (due to creativity), the m orphic field causes this to occur with\nincreasing ease in the future,\nindependent of location. As an\nexample, he suggested that once a particular crystal has been formed *\nsomewhere in the world, its\nsubsequent crystal lisa tion anywhere\nfrom the same type of components\nwill be easier.\nThe counter-argument to this has\nbeen that fragments of the crystal\nhave somehow been carried from\none laboratory to the next, perhaps\nin scientists' beards!\nDr Sheldrake has been testing his\nidea in the Open University on the\nabnormal d velo p ment of fruit flies.\nOnce abnormal development has\noccurred, it becomes easier for\nsubsequent fruit flies to develop\nabnormally although they are not in\nany way related to the fruit flies\npreviously tested. Experiments have\nalso been carried out in the UK,\nUSA and Australia on the ability of\nunrelated rats to escape from mazes\nwith the same results.\nMemory is not stored\nin brain cells; they are\ndrawn from a 'cosmic\nmemory bank'\nThis theory of habit has three\nmajor effects on former\nassumptions.\n1. Heredity\u2014habits and\ncharacteristics are carried through\nm orphic resonance and not genes.\n2. Memory\u2014This is influenced by\nthe similarity of thought pattern\noccurring in the past. The most\nsimilar pattern transmitted is usually\none's own in the past; otherwise it\ncould be another's thought pattern.\nMemories are drawn from a 'cosmic\nmemory bank'. An analogy is that\nyour brain is like a TV set\u2014it tunes\ninto fields but does not record\nprogrammes which have passed its\nscreen before. Memory is not stored\nin brain cells; this is backed up by\ncircumstantial evidence that the part\nof the brain containing the memory\nhas not been conclusively found-no complete removal of memory\ndue to the destruction of brain cells\nhas yet occurred. Ian Stephenson\nproduced some case studies\nwhereby children 'remembered'\nthings that they could not possibly\nknow. The usual counter-argument\nto these studies is that it is either not\npossible as it cannot be explained,\nor that it proves reincarnation.\nMorphic resonance provides a better\nexplanation. Telepathy, which Dr\nSheldrake claimed has happened to\njust over fifty per cent of the world,\ncan also be explained by this theory.\nHowever, this brings up a question: since survival of the spirit\ndepends on one's memories, what\nhappens when we die? If the\nmemory is not stored in the brain,\nspiritually we must survive.\n3. Rituals\u2014All societies connect\nwith their ancestors through rituals,\neg Thanksgiving, Passover,\nEucharist. From the theory of\nm orphic fields, the more similar the\nritual is carried out to the way it was\noriginally done, the more you can\nconnect with all the people who\nhave carried it out in the past.\nCreativity\nThe habits theory explains regularity\nin the universe\u2014but where did this\ncome from? There are three different\nexplanations to this:\n1. Throw backs or reversion:\nsomething that has happened in the\npast, stored in the m orphic field,\nhappens again.\n2. 'Evolutionary plagiarism':\nsomething that has happened\nelsewhere occurs, eg the eyes of\nvertebrates and octopuses are\nsimilar although they have\ndeveloped from different origins.\n3. Influences from 'above' or\n'below': from 'below' we are\nconsidered to operate entirely due\nto chance, ie we can't predict or\nunderstand anything in the\nuniverse, a 'materialistic' viewpoint.\nFrom 'above' we are governed by\nthe Platonic Theory of Creativity, an\neternal stand consisting of latent\narchetypes produced by a supreme\nbeing.\nAccording to Dr Sheldrake, then,\ncreativity is thus two-fold, as\nexplained in religion, eg Shiva and\nShafti (where Shiva is formative but\nlacking energy; Shafti, blind\nun directed energy; together they are i creative), Yin and Yang, Spirit and\nLogos, or, indeed, man and woman.\nThe two interact at all levels and\nsustain one another.\nThe Theosophical Society\u2014\nTheosophy is defined as 'Divine\nWisdom' and represents the\n'knowledge of truth'. Its\nfundamental principles are the unity\nof all, the universality of law and\nevolution. The address of the\nSociety is:\nDept ESS,\nThe Theosophical Society,\n50 Gloucester Place,\nLondon W1H 3HJ.

    "content": "Sport\nJUDO Champions TH ESVOKIS PAGE\nAgain!\nLast weekend were the two most\nimportant days in the diaries of Judo\npl avers in universities, colleges and\npolytechnics all over Great Britain\u2014\nthe 1988-89 British Students Judo\nChampionships, incorporating the\nBritish Universities Championships\nand the British Colleges and\nPolytechnics Championships.\n186 of the best Judo players from\n49 universities, colleges and\npolytechnics gathered to Crystal\nPalace National Sports Centre on\nDecember 3 and 4 amongst these,\nrepresenting University of London,\nwere four Imperial College players;\nPete Swettenham, Dave Buttles,\nJonathan Lean and Yoke-Foong\nTan.\nThe first day was an individuals\nevent, each player competing within\ntheir own weight. Our two black\nbelts, Pete and Dave did very well\nand Dave won two bronze medals\nin the under 86kgs category\u2014on in\nthe Universities Competition and\none in the Unis, Colleges and Polys\ncombined events. Pete started his\nday by throwing his first opponent\nin five seconds and then proceeded\nto win every one of his fights until\ndrawing in the semi-finals.\nUnfortunately, he lost this last draw\non a decision\u2014and so took the\nbronze in the under 71kg category.\nHe got his revenge by very\nconvincingly beating this same final\nopponent in another fight the\nfollowing day...!\nJon won his first fight in his first\nround, but lost to an eventual\nfinalist, so finishing un placed in the\nunder 78kgs. Yoke-Foong was left as the only\ncompetitor in the women's under\n48kgs category after one woman\nwas moved up one, and the others\npulled out due to injuries, and so no\ncompetition here was held. She\nopted to fight in the higher weight\ncategory rather than pull out\nwithout fighting, but finished\nun placed in the under 25kgs group.\nThe total medal count for London\nafter eleven gruelling hours was 2\ngolds, 1 silver and 7 bronzes.\n...Then they all had to get up\nagain on Sunday morning for the\n8.45am start of the teams events.\nThis was a more exciting day, with\nmainly the London Uni and\nGlasgow Uni crowds trying to shout\neach other down.\nIn the five-man team event,\nLondon University went on to beat\narch rivals Cambridge in the finals.\nThe two IC men Pe^e and Dave did\nnot concede a fight.\nIC's four judo representatives Jon, Dave, Pete and\nYoke-Foong.\nIn the ten-men area competition,\nLondon lost in the semi-finals in a very close contest against Scotland,\nthe eventual winners. Hero of this\nevent was Dave Butles, with the\nscore standing at two wins a piece\nand five draws, everything rested\nwith the last fight\u2014Dave's. Unfortunately, he took a very bad\nfall and dislocated his right\nshoulder. Despite pleas from his\nteam, coaches and supporting\ncrowd not to fight on, he did, after\nthe first aid crew put his shoulder\nback in. But after getting out of a hold down and then being charged\ninto the mat on that same shoulder,\nhe was forced to concede the match\nwith 45 seconds to go.\nIn the Women's Teams events,\nLondon could only field a team of\nfour women and lost their matches.\nYoke-Foong was unfortunate\nenough to be drawn against a gold\nmedallist in the under 72kgs in her\nfirst fight and in her second the\nunder 61kgs gold medallist, who is\nalso one of the National Student's squad going to the USSR this\nmonth.\nHOCKEY Fine\nPerformance\nIC III\u20142\nThames Poly II\u20140\nAfter a good term, IC Ills wanted to\nfinish on a high note. Going into the\ngame with Andy Lewis, a reprobate\nfrom the first eleven, hopes were\nhigh. After a period of heavy\npressure, including some fine saves\nfrom debut ant keeper Jasbir Lota, IC\nbroke into the oppositions D for\nKeven Hill to finish superbly for his\nfirst IC goal.\nIn the second half the pressure\nwas on the IC goal and only\nexcellent defending prevented the\nscore being levelled. After one or\ntwo missed opportunities, a rare\nbreak out of defence gave Steve\nBurton a chance to redeem himself\nand put the result beyond doubt,\nwhich he did by slotting the ball just\ninside the right hand post.\nMEN'S HOCKEY League\nHiccup\nThe 2nds remarkable record of\nfourteen games unbeaten was\nstopped on Saturday on a pitch at\nMilton Keynes which resembled a football field. The season began with\ntriumph in the UAU, defeating all\nopposition with a team that other\nuniversities would be proud to call\nl sts.21 goals for and 1 against\nensure a strong position going into\nthe Challenge Round.\nIn the Saturday Club league, IC's strong position in second place has\nbeen under threat as injuries in both\nthe l sts and 2nds has weakened the\nteam considerably. Improvement by\nplayers such as Manog Tseung and\nJason Currey, the solid\ndependability in defence of John\nBlanshard and Paul Turner, and flair\nup front from Mark London\nsupporting centre forward Max\nMichaelis have eased the burden,\nbut the straw that broke the 2nds backs was added by Milton Keyens\nin a hard, determined battle with\nclose chances at both ends. IC still\nremain in touch with the league\nleaders and with the return from\ninjury of several players over the\ncoming weeks.\nBADMINTON UAU\nMisfortune\nIn November an IC team took part\nin the UAU individual\nchampionships at Nottingham. In\nthe men's singles Tim Bartle lost in\nthe first round and Trevor Kernick\nin the second. Both played well\nagin st players of a high standard.\nHans Mullannaa did extremely well.\nHe reached the quarter finals with\ngreat ease where he unfortunately\nmet the number 41 in the world and\nit is no disgrace to lose to people of\nthis standard. In the mixed doubles\nRichard Etheridge and Sue Wain,\nSteve Madden and Tarn were\nunfortunately knocked out in the\nfirst round but Simon Hughes and\nJo rache d the last 16 to lose closely\nto a Loughborough pair. In the\nmen's doubles Trevor and Richard\nhad the misfortune of meeting the\nmen's doubles champions in the\nfirst round and Hans and Steve lost\nclosely to a Lancaster pair. Simon\nand Tim though did well to reach\nthe last 16 eventually losing to an\nextremely strong Liverpool pair. A great weekend was had by all and\nthanks are due to Steve's parents for\nputting and feeding us up.\nPage 28 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nm7|m Look Back In\nAnger\nBy John Osborne at the Theatre\nMuseum Covent Garden\n'Why is Jimmy Porter angry?',\nasked puzzled critics of John\nOsborne's bitter anti-hero as he\nexploded onto the Royal Court's stage in 1956, depriving them of an\nevening of comfortable mush and\nbreaching the walls of post-war\ntheatre's sanctuary for imperial\nnostalgia.\nAs Jimmy's wife Alison explains\nto her 'Edwardian plant' of a father,\n'You're hurt because everything is\nchanged, Jimmy's hurt because\neverything is the same.' Educated,\npassionate, and hungry for change\nJimmy's is the voice of post-war\nyouth. Sceptical of the 'new deal'\npromised in the new world of\nLabour's Britian, they are bitter at\nthe reality that the class structure\ndinosaur is still casting bleak\nshadows on their lives and futures.\nJimmy's response is to go into\nbattle in his own inimitable way.\nRising to the bait of her parent's excessive d is apporval and their\neccentric schemes to di sua de him he\nis driven in his pursuit of English\nrose Alison, even to the final\ndesecration of marrying her. With\nhis enemy hostage intact he daily\nwins the petty victories of\npersecution with his constant\ntaunting. His attacks are dampened\nonly by the presence of Cliff a mutual friend and 'no-man's land'\nbetween the unhappy couple. So we\ndiscover Alison at the start of the\nplay; under siege, heading for\nexhaustion, and weighed down by\nsome unwelcome news which she\nmust find a way to break to her self-absorbed tormentor.\nThe living room intimacy of the\nTheatre Museum's tiny low level\nstage is the perfect setting in which\nto subject the audience to the\nclaustrophobia and in e luc t ability of\nthe scenes to come.\nIn Jim Dunk's new production\nRobert Daws has amplified Porter's obnoxious ness out of the realm\naccessible to human sympathy and\ninto a region where hate and pity\nmust be our main feelings towards\nhim. Jimmy's overheated tirades in\nthe first act may leave you with cloth\nears, off of which the most profound\nelements of his ranting s may simply\nbounce for the rest of the play. In\nthis he lacks the sugar coated\nsarcasm and understated venom\nthat Richard Burton brought to the\nscreen adaptation, with a character\nwhom one felt paid doubly with the\nslow burn of self-consuming\nbitterness for every insult he threw\nat those around him. The frantic\nagitation of Daw's Porter, especially\nduring the first act, hardly cuts as\nnoble a figure. To interpret this\nMolotov cocktail of a man as\nsomething of a psychiatrist's nightmare can hardly be said,\nhowever, to depart too far from\nOsborne's flaming text.\nDunk's approach to the end of the\nplay is a refusal to cloak Alison's previous suffering with a neat and\nsentimental reconciliation scene; her\npathetically limp figure leaves one\nin ni to who is the victim\nand \u201e,,w me aggressor in the\nsupposedly mutual battle. This\nfloats the issue of the couple's future\nas an unresolved question and\nprevents an obscuring of the play's complexities by a 'happily ever\nafter' ending and as such it is a welcome interpretation of a much\ncriticised ending.\nIn 1956 Jimmy Porter was the\nangry young spokesman for an\nangry new generation. Today's generation's are sure to thank\nOsborne for the theatrical revolution\nof his first play and its legacy of\nrealism in the theatre, but what do\nthey make of the bitterness and\nanger without their own sense of\nstruggle? What kind of figure does\nPorter cut in the eighties of the\ninstant coffee hero? The play may be\ndated but whether or not it is\nirrelevant to the audiences of today\nremains for them to judge.\n\u2022 Why is Jimmy Porter angry? If you\nwant to find out you're guaranteed\nan evening of provocative theatre\nthat will keep you buzzing into the\nwee small hours. You'll leave with\na thirst for more drama with even\nhalf this energy and guts, and with\na tendency towards itchy feet the\nnext time you're served up a slice\nof safe trivial theatre. If, however,\nyou don't much care, well, they say\nthat ignorance is bliss.\n(Look Back in Anger continues at\nthe Theatre Museum Covent\nGarden until December 17.)\nMAC.\nI cut myself shaving\nCameron's Closet\nCert 18\nWhat can I say? This is pretty much\nyour average, off the shelf demonic,\nblood and gore type horror movie.\nHere's how it goes, you remember,\nwhen you were five or six year's old, when you went to bed and you\nkept thinking there was something\nunder the bed or in the wardrobe.\nWell in Cameron's case, there is.\nWell you can guess the rest, the plot\ntrundles along at a steady pace\ntaking the usual trail of corpses\ntowards the inevitable final\nconfrontation where the foul fiend\nis sent back to the deepest pits of\nhell from whence it came.\n! The acting is average, and the\ndirector, Armand Mastroianni, has\ndone his best with the script and an\nobviously limited budget. The real\nstart should b ave been Carlo\nRamhildi, who did the special\neffects and who was responsible for\nFT, Close Encounters and snuff movie\neffects in Alien.

Haunted is a typical\nHerbert horror story. That in itself\nis not too bad a thing, but it does\ngive his new book a feeling of\nrepetition with respect to its recent\npredecessors.\nAsh is a psychic investigator. He\nmakes his living exposing fake\nmediums and providing rational\nexplanations for alleged spooky\ngoings on.\nHe doesn't believe in ghosts.\nThe Mariel family hire him to\ninquire into the strange experiences\nthey have undergone in their big old\nhouse, Edbrook.\nAsh is hindered by his rationality,\nscepticism, and the hosts who are\njust bloody odd.\nAs the story unfolds it becomes\nquite clear what is going to happen\nat the end, to us if not Ash. He just\ngets more confused and jumpy. 'It's okay David, it's just skeletons\ntapping in the closet. Go on let them\nout.'\nWhere this story fails in tension\nand surprise. In plot it is too similar\nto James Herbert's The Jonah and The\nSurvivor.\nOnly the lead role is of\nimportance. The additional\ncharacters provide a means of\nrevealing traumatic events of the\npast and the discoveries reflect a naivety and self-deceit which is\nslowly uncovered. But they serve\nlittle other purpose.\nThe predictable clich ed remnants\nare of course well written and it's nice to see Herbert return to a more\nclassical horror theme, absent in\nrecent books.\nHowever, at \u00a311 for just 224 pages\nI can't recommend this to anybody\nother than existing converts.\nWait until it's available in\npaperback, and buy the James\nHerbert compilation in the\nmeantime.\nAndrew Clarke.\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 35\n\n"

    "content": "Sport\nIts the hack y racers!\nSAILING\nLiam's Luck\nLast weekend saw the Sailing Club\ntravelling to Exeter for the last away\nmatch of the term. After an early\nstart, Henry was seen discussing\nrace tactics with the great white\ntelephone and the Tufty Club were\nshowing a distinct lack of speed,\nprobably due to a high facial friction\ncoefficient. In the first race IC had\n\u2022an excellent start but Liam, showing\nhis natural flair, decided to give his\nboat abou yancy test and soon\nmoved back into last position. This\nincident resulted in much mirth\nfrom everyone except the captain,\nBill, who realised we were losing,\nbut by some brilliant tactical racing\nfrom the remaining IC boats, IC\ngained first and second places to\nwin the race. Liam stood out again\nin the second race due to the fact\nthat he had been replaced by\nRichard, despite this, IC went on to\nwin first, second and third places.\nBy now the wind was building\nsteadily and the conditions suited\nsome of the heavier members of the\nIC team. For the afternoon session\nit was decided that to make closer\nracing the IC and Exeter teams\nshould be mixed. In the third race\nRichard lead from the start to take\nfirst place and led his team to a close\nvictory. Charles had a near perfect\nstart in the fourth race by crossing\nthe start line second himself, and\nforcing two boats to start badly,\nunfortunately, because of the\nconfusion of the rearranged teams\nthe boats that had been forced to\nstart late were on Charles' team.\nDespite this Charles went on to lead\nhis team to a con vining win, even\nthough Richard took line honours\nagain. After another display of front\ncrawl from Liam, the wind had\nbecome very gusty with the forecast\nfor a force 7, so racing was\nabandoned for the team to lark\naround in Exeter's new boats.\nFOOTBALL\nBattling Draw\nHaving gone out of the cup by the\nodd goal in nine on Saturday, IC's sights turned towards the league.\nUnbeaten so far, the question on\neveryone's lips was 'can they keep\ngoing 'till xmas?'. A poor start, and\na dod gy back pass resulted in a goal\nagainst IC. Another was conceded\nlater, as some heads began to drop.\nHowever, after the turnaround, IC\nlooked a different team. Mike\nConnor, playing his last game\nbefore returning to the States had as to rmer; Julian Fordham danced his\nway around the pitch and Neil\nLeonard's tireless running created\nspace up front. It wasn't long before\nIC's start, Guy Phiri found the net\nwith a shot from the edge of the box.\nThen tragedy! Kev Graves, who was\ngrowing in confidence all the time,\nwent in for a tackle. Badly miss-timed, it resulted in a very bad break\nof his leg. Like a true tour vet, he\ngritted his teeth and waited to be\ntaken to hospital. The gallant\ncaptain Jezz Holland kept him\ncompany, and IC brought on\nCameron Gilmour as super-sub.\nDown to ten men IC surged\nforward, and it wasn't long before\nthey gained a penalty after Guy\nPhiri was fouled. Ed Coates slotted\nit home very nicely and IC got the\ndraw they so richly deserved.\nk..........K'\"9' Neil McCluskey\nNeil has adopted the quite\nmundane tactic of being seen\nregularly in the Union Office. As\nto what he does I am not quite\nsure. He doesn't sharpen pencils,\nstaple bits of paper together or do\nnothing like the current Union\nPresident.\nThe fact that Neil is a capable\nperson (though at what I am not\nquite sure) puts him at an immediate disadvantage in his quest\nfor the post of Union President.\nHis campaign has been very\nlow key to date, consisting almost\nentirely of articles on the Union\npage of FELIX about nothing in\nparticular. In fact no one seems to\nknow who he is. So here is a brief\nrundown:\nHe was born and laid in a manger in Clapham. This wasn't because there was no room at the\nRed Lion inn, but because the\nbailiffs had taken the furniture.\nHe was slung into the mines at\nthe age of 2 where he was used\nto mop sweat of the brows of\nminers.\nBy a stroke of luck, at 15 years\nof age he found the Hope Diamond on the floor of the pit and\nsold it at immense profit. He then\nfounded his multinational corporation TCI', moved in with a girl called Tara, became pregnant,\ngot into drugs, caught and was\ncured of the pox, and finally joined the moon ies. He could chant louder and\nmore clearly than anyone else, but\nwas ousted because he caught\nver ruc as and joined the Foreign\nLegion. There he was used and\nabused by many of the Officers,\nespecially Field Marshal Tufty\nFluffball who loved the way he\nsat. They would often walk out\ninto the moonlit dunes together\nand describe their stamp collections beneath star-studded skies.\nOne night a meteor blazed from\nthe sky and happened to ca on tain some very frustrated aliens. On\neyeing nubile Neil ambling\nthrough the sand they couldn't resist beaming him up. They used him and abused him in the\nmost horrible ways. Suffice it to\nsay he walked bow legged for\nseveral weeks afterwards. Bored,\nthe aliens deposited him in a dreary Quad in South Kensington. There he made his way,\nstill bow legged, up a set of stairs\nto the office where he has remained ever since.\nLiz Warren\nField Marshal Tufty Fluffball\nhas since had a sex change opera-tion, changed his name to Liz\nWarren and is now responsible\nfor cooking the books etc in the\nFELIX office. Liz, not content with\nthis numerical gastronomy has set\nher heart on becoming editor of\nthe publication.\nTowards this end Liz has set\nabout learning the intricacies of\nthe printing machine, typesetting\nand tea making, and eating\nmuesli. Unfortunately, she is taking the idea that knowledge can\n'rub off too seriously and is trying her best to seduce the current\neditor.\nIf she succeeded in her quest,\nsay sources within the FELIX of-f ice, her staff would be reduced,\nthrough constant nagging, to\nquivering jellies within a week.\nRobin Davison\nRobin Davison used to be the archetypal nerd, a member of the\nScience Fiction society, and a train\nspotter until he decided he would\nlike to stand as FELIX Editor.\nOvernight his image completely\nchanged; the flares went in the\nbin and he went into Next to\nemerge cravat ted and well\nheeled.\nRob has taken to writing articles\nin the Telegraph and shows an\noverwhelming interest in learning\nhow to use every piece of\nmachinery within the FELIX of-f ice. Unfortunately Rob is taking\nthe idea that knowledge can 'rub\noff too seriously and Bill often\nhas to swat him off his shoulder.\nGood luck Rob, you will need it.\nDavid Williams\nDave Williams is a man with long\nhair and looks like a girl ie. David,\nwill therefore be ideally suited to\ntake over the post of Hon Sec of\nEntertainments, from Wendy\nMorris. Dave will be standing on\nthe ever succesful Bums and Tits\nplatform, and in fact has already\ncommissioned FELIX to typeset te his posters which proclaim 'vote\nfor me I'm a girl ie( honest)'.\nDavid's only qualification for\nthe job is achieving the post of\nduplicating officer of RCS Union.\nNevertheless he has already\nbegun his election campaign in\nearnest and at every available opportunity wanders around the\nSnackbar and says hello to people he has never met before.\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 29\n\n"

    "content": "On the Tube\nUnderpants in the bath\nPhillipe always jotted down his thoughts while sitting on a table in his\nfavourite jazz club, before the throngs started arriving. Like always, he\nraced down the road in his immaculately kept dark green Bugatti Coupe\n50, past the cinema outside which people waited for the next show to start.\nA poster showed James Dean in a clip from 'East of Eden'. Phillipe turned\nround a corner and parked his car outside a dark alley. He walked the rest\nof the distance, lighting up a Gauloises on his way and went throught a door into the basement where black musicians from Harlem played every\nSaturday. This is what he wrote.\nChristmas is an occasion celebrated around the world by devout Christians\nand others (Protestants, Evangelists etc.) in a fashion which suits the culture\nof the country. In East Beirut shots are fired at anything that moves. In\nSouth Africa, Santa Claus races around Johannesburg in an armoured\nMercedes 500SL giving Afrikaaner children water cannons and toy guns\nto protect themselves from black violence. At home we have to repeat the\nsame routine again. Meet all those relatives who we despise, get run over\nand mowed down by little cousins who want to play Monopoly, buy a hundred million presents, commit the sin of gluttony by eating numerous\ndinners, overdoses of mince pies and burnt Christmas puddings soaked\nin Cointreau, indulge in excessive amounts of champagne, port and lager.\nAnd then make the New Year's resolutions and jot them down on a FiloFax. But there are also the bright side of things. You can go to a party and\nstand under the mistletoe reeking of mouthwash. If you happen to meet\nyour dream person, try to strike up a conversation (assuming you are not\nsuffering from brain death due to the lectures you had so far). Remember\nthe times when Christmas used to be fun? When you were very little,\nstanding in a cot, a nappy tied round your bum, covered with Boots talcum\npowder and had your cheeks pinched by stupid adults who made silly\ncooing sounds and showered you with an avalanche of coloured blocks,\nballoons, pink rubber nipples and toys which made a rattling sound when\nyou shook them, making you wonder if they were broken even before you\nhad a chance to throw them around. It is also a nice occasion when you\nare old and senile and your bones rattle, so you end up listening or talking\nto yourself when nobody else is interested in what you have to say. On\nChristmas day you sit where the in-laws put you (most likely very close\nto the fire-side) and watch Roger Moore in a James Bond yarn the umpteenth\ntime.\nSo what happened in 1988? A few months ago, the smooth talking\nMargaret made the statement that there could be no united states of Europe.\nI do not understand her vague political and economical reasoning but let\nus examine the more obvious side of things. The matter of fact is that the\nBritish cannot accept to be called Europeans, because this reduces them\nto mere faces in the herd and puts their culture, eccentricity and\nindividuality at jeopardy. How can the stiff upper-lipped Englishman from\nEton who drives a smooth cruising Jaguar, lives in Tunbridge Wells and\nconverses with old club by gentlemen about Spitfires and the Empire,\nassociate himself with plump Germans eating Sauerkraut and drinking Beer\nin big electrical corporations, saying;'Und zat ist all in the past now, ya!',\nor with the average Baguette carrying, beret wearing Frenchmen? Nor do\nI see the Neighbours and Marks & Spencer mentality Englishwomen getting\nto terms with their rather cool 'Marie-Claire' counterparts. There exists a Dutch sailors' poem written a century ago which sings the praises of French\nwomen in bed and English women in the kitchen. Anybody who can\nconfirm the truth in this statement, please do drop into the Felix\nHeadquarters for a drink and a chat. So if we cannot stand the i dio sync rac ies of our Euro ^ns cousins, what charm do we find in the 'merchant-minded', 1 mouthed Yanks? What makes us watch their shallow,\nnihilistic films, eat their 'plastic' processed food and copy their style in\nmoney and finance? Does Maggie feel that if we criticize their gun-boat\ndiplomacy they would impose a trade embargo on 501s? Well, yet another\nclown got elected in the washing-powder style American presidential\nc map a ign and off went the Iron lady attired in her Christian Dior dress\"\n(bought with money taken out from university grants) to play with him\nwhatever games politicians play. George Bush has been a member of the\nelite Harvard University Skulls & Bones club (males only). In the initiation\nceremony, a recruit is asked to tell everything about himself. Bush disclosed\nthat he wore underpants in the bath. When asked why, he confessed that\nhe did not want to look down on the unemployed. However that was back\nin the Forties and things have changed. Ms. Bhutto has become the Premier\nof Pakistan, the most boring country after Saudi Arabia, and if all seats\nfor Siberia are booked then this is the place where you can send your\nmother-in- law on a one way ticket. But the change is nevertheless welcome.\nNew theories are being suggested for the Kennedy as s as i nation. Here is\nour analysis: J. Edgar Hoover never developed a liking for J.F.K because\nof the latter's womanizing and other colourful pastimes. He may have\nconspired with the Mafia to have Johny killed. Shopping could be the most\nharrowing part of the story. Buying a present for your girlfriend or boyfriend\n(depending what your preferences and inclinations may be) is bad news.\nWhere would you go? Go to Harrods and get lost in its opulent and\npretentious interiors. And as you try to find your way to the Perfume\ndepartment to douse yourself in half a bottle of Davidoff, you see hordes\nof overdressed rich aliens out to buy English goods so that when they go\nback to whichever philistine land they come from and brag about having\nseen all the sights in London, which in their opinion is a way to become\ncivilized . But as any self respecting connoisseur would tell you, it really\nboils down to the rules of Cricket, either you know them or you do not.\nThe English people, however cannot be pardoned either. They believe that\nif they know a thing or two about wines, can order pastry in a French\nbrassiere and have a Constable or a relic of the Raj in their living rooms\nthen they are made of finer clay than the rest. What nonsense! Go to Oxford\ncircus or Regent street avoiding the Hispanic women who stand outside\ntube stations handing out pamphlets for English language schools, mad\ncab drivers giving their frightened American passengers five hundred horsepower rides down the road, and the clumsy shoppers who cannot walk\nstraight, to finally discover, upon entering a rather tacky shop that you\nhave not brought your wallet.\nThe 'on the tube' shopping guide: -Buy a bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau for\npeople who consider themselves slightly sophisticated, but tell them that\nit should be drunk before New Year. -Perfumes and toiletries from House\nof Fraser Armani, Dunhill, Trussardi, Grey Flannel (for men) Chanel,\nPoison, Clinique (for women) Ladies leather purses in Next, High street\nKensington Unisex hats, berets and other para ph en alia in Amazon, Church\nstreet Kensington. Jumpers for boys and girls in Jumpers, High street\nKensington Men's accessories in Blazer, King's Road and High street\nKensington Waistcoats in Kensington Market, designer waistcoats from\nTom GUby's waistcoat gallery, 2 New Burlingtion Place. American Classics\nnear Covent Garden tube station sell good second hand clothes Ladies items\nin Hermes, New Bond street and Browns in South Molton street. Toiletries,\ngreasy facial creams, fuming bath salts and mediocre perfumes from Body\nShop. Probably the best bet is to buy watches, bangles, braces and silver\ncondom carrying cases etc. (available from a certain shop near Habitat on\nKing's Road) from Kensington Market, Camden Town Market and resort\nto giving away scarfs, gloves, handkerchiefs, boxer shorts and braces bought\nfrom Tie Rack and Sock shop. Finally a few words of wisdom for the new\nyear:\nAnd if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press, End in what All begins and\nends in-Yes; Think then you are TO-DAY what YESTERDAY You were\n-TOMORROW you shall not be less.\nOmar Khayyam\nEmile Nizan\nDecember 1988\nLondon\nPage 32 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nWhat's the point of /C\\f Christmas?\n\" \u00bb' _ :\n\u2022 \u2014 * JAg^zA\nBy Keith Adeney 7\nChristmas has many faces, from mince pies to sliced turkey; Santa to the\nbaby Jesus. Christmas trees, carol singing, and sending Christmas cards,\nall are images of Christmas. But have you ever stopped and wondered\nwhere Christmas gets all its 'added baggage' from? After all it is the\ncelebration of Jesus' birthday; or is it?\nThe Winter Solstice\nLong before the birth of Jesus,\npeople had held special celebrations\nat the time of the winter solstice, the\nshortest day in the year. In the\nnorthern hemisphere the winter\nsolstice ('solstice' literally means\n'the sun standing still') falls on\nDecember 22nd. When people saw the days getting\nshorter, they thought that the sun\nwas dying, so they performed\nrituals to make sure of its return.\nWorshippers of the sun celebrated\nthe 25th of December as the sun's birthday. They built bonfires on this\nday to mark the fact that the amount\nof sunlight was to now increase day\nby day. Druids would make human\nsacrifice to their woodland spirits to\nappease them and persuade them to\ncause growth in the following\nspring. Later the ancient Romans\nspread a festival called saturn alia through their empire. It was held in\nthe latter part of December and\nwent on for a week. It was given in\nhonour of Saturn, the god of\neverything that grew. During this\npublic holiday, people exchanged\ngifts, especially candles, and slaves\nwere freed for a day, and allowed\nto do and say what they liked.\nThe Birth of Christ\nWhen Jesus was born 2000 years\nago, there were no birth-certificates.\nNo-one knows the exact day of\nJesus' birth, moreover we do know\nit was not in December, as the\nshepherd and the sheep they were\nwatching would have frozen in the\nPalestinian winter. In the early days\nof Christianity it was decided to\ncelebrate Jesus' birthday in\nmidwinter. This was because it was\nalready an important occasion. The\nfestivities that were in existence\nwere changed from celebrating the\nsun's birthday, to celebrating the\nbirthday of Jesus Christ, God's own\nSon.\nSo celebrating at the end of\nDecember goes back much further\nthan Christianity, but where did all\nthe spin-offs we know so well today\ncome from?\nThe First Santa\nChildren are told to hang their\nstockings up by the fireplace on\nChristmas Eve. Santa then dutifully\nfills them with toys and candy when\nhe comes down the chimney to put\npresents underneath the Christmas\nTree. But where did this jolly red\ngentleman, who drives his reindeer\nteam through the skies come from?\nThe original Santa Claus was St.\nNicholas, the Bishop of Myra in Asia\nin the fourth century. He was\nfamous for his generosity, which is\nwhy he is presented as the giver of\ngifts at Christmas.\nOne story about him is that\nbecause he was a shy man, he liked\nto give money anonymously to the\nneedy. So, one day, he climbed the\nroof of a house and dropped a purse\nof money down the chimney of a' family of needy girls. The purse\nlanded in the stockings which the\ngirls had hung up by the fire to dry.\nNow children expect a similar\n'purse' to drop into their own\nstockings. These days however the\nstockings are generally not so\noptimal ly located, so Santa has to\nslide down the chimney in his soot-proof coat to fill them.\nThe first European St Nick was\nDutch. He was a bearded man on\na white horse, bringing presents for\ngood children and a bundle of birch\nrods for naughty boys and girls.\nWhen the tradition spread to\nAmerica, children thought that he\ncame from the North Pole, so he\nneeded a sledge and reindeer. This\nis the Santa who-also visits Britain.\nThe Christmas Tree\nThe Christmas Tree goes back to the\neighth century, to a missionary from\nDevon called St. Boniface. He went\nto Germany to teach people about\nChrist. There, one December, he\nencountered a group of people\nstanding beneath an oak tree ready\nto sacrifice a child to please their\ngod. Boniface rescued the child and\nhad the oak tree chopped down. At\nits foot was a small fir tree. Boniface\ngave this to the people as a symbol\nof life. He called it the tree of the\nChrist-child.\nThe story continues many\ncenturies later in the December of\n1540, when Martin Luther, the\nfamous German church leader, cut\ndown a fir tree and took it home\nwith .him. The evergreen tree\nreminded him that life continued\nthrough the winter, when most of\nnature appeared to have died. He\nattached a number of candles to\nilluminate the tree and to express\nthat Christ was welcome in his\nhome.\nBut it was not until the middle of\nthe' nineteenth century, that the\nPage 24 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nChristmas Gourmet Why not amaze or enchant your\nfriends by cooking a com muni al Christmas dinner for your flat or\nhall landing?\nRoast turkey with sausages, bread\nsauce, stuffing and gravy, roast\npotatoes, boiled potatoes, b russel sprouts and carrots; Christmas\npudding and brandy butter.\nIt is probably easiest to buy an\noven-ready frozen turkey. Allow\nabout %lb per person e. g.a61b turkey for 8 people. Thaw the\nturkey for about 24 hours. Place the\nstuffing (packet stuffing is easiest)\ninto the neck end of the body cavity.\nRub a little salt and pepper into the\nskin to season it. Place the turkey in\na roasting tin, resting on small dabs\nof butter, and cover with rashers of\nbacon (this gives a tasty tang to the\nturkey skin). Cook at 230 C/450F or\ngas mark 8, allowing about 15\nminutes for every pound, plus 45\nminutes.\nTo make the roast potatoes, peel\none or two potatoes per person and\nplace around the turkey about 1 x k hours before the end of cooking.\nSpoon a little of the fat over the\npotatoes. Turn over halfway\nthrough cooking.\nApproximately % hour before the\nend of cooking place the small\nsausages around the turkey. Spoon\nfat over them and turn once during\ncooking.\nTo make the bread sauce, put Vi\npint of milk into a pan and season\nwith salt and pepper. Add two or\nthree slices of bread crumbled into\nbreadcrumbs (stale bread works\nbetter!) and warm gently for 15\nminutes. Heat the sauce rapidly just\nbefore serving.\nMake the gravy when the turkey\nhas finished cooking. Remove it, the\npotatoes and the sausages from the\nroasting tin (place them on a plate\nand keep them warm in the cooling\noven). Pour away most of the fat\n(but not directly down the sink) and\nput the roasting tin on a hot ring.\nAdd a little flour to the fat and let\nit cook and thicken, then dilute the\ngravy with water (using water from\nthe vegetables improves the flavour)\nuntil you get the thickness you like.\nAlternatively you can make gravy\nfrom a packet, but it really doesn't taste the same.\nVegetables: peel or scrape the\ncarrots. It is more impressive to cut\nthem into strips about 1 Vi\" long.\nPlace in salted water, bring to the\nboil and simmer for about 20\nminutes. Peel the potatoes and cut\nthem into evenly sized chunks.\nCook similarly to the carrots, but for\n30-35 minutes. Prepare the sprouts\nby slicing off the end of the stalk.\nRemove the outer 2 or 3 leaves and\nmake crosswise cuts into the base of\nthe stalk (this allows the sprouts to\ncook more thoroughly). Place them\nin a pan, salt and pour boiling water\nover them. Bring back to the boil\nand simmer for 20-25 minutes.\nChristmas pudding and\nBrandy butter\nBuy your Christmas pudding: it is\nfar too late to make one as it requires\nabout eight hours cooking and\nseveral months for the flavour to\nmature!\nTo make the Brandy butter, cream\n(i.e. put the butter in a bowl and\nsoften using the back of a wooden\nspoon to press the butter against the\nside of the bowl) 3oz butter until\npale and soft. Beat in 3oz of caster\nsugar gradually and then add 2-3\ntablespoons of Brandy slowly\n(taking care not to let the mixture\ncurdle). Leave the butter to harden\nbefore serving.\nVegetarian Menu.\nVegetarians do not eat nut roasts for\nChristmas dinner. What they do eat\nis Mushroom Timbale. The recipe is\nas follows (quoted from Not Just A Load Of Old Lentils by Rose Elliot,.\nFontana 1972):\nIngredients\n1 large onion 8 flat mushrooms 2\ntomatoes, skinned 2 oz butter 1 tbs\nflour Vi pint water 1 tsp yeast extract\n1 heaped tsp mixed herbs 8 oz finely\ngrated cashew nuts8 oz soft\nbreadcrumbs 2 eggs salt and pepper\nto garnish:\n1 tomato, sliced\n1 lemon, sliced\na few sprigs of parsley\nMethod\nPeel the onion and chop finely;\nwash and finely chop 4 of the\nmushrooms and slice the tomatoes;\ns aute together gently in the butter\nfor 10 minutes, then add the flour.\nStir for a minute, then add the\nwater, yeast extract and herbs. Stir\nuntil thickened, then add the rest of\nthe ingredients. Line a21b loaf tin\nwith foil then brush thoroughly with\nmelted butter. Place the remaining\n4 mushrooms,black side down in\nthe bottom of the tin, spoon the\nmixture on top, smooth over and\ncover with more buttered foil, tying\nsecurely with string. Steam for two\nhours.

    "content": "Music\nOn Christmas\nChristmas, a time for kindness,\ngoodwill and peaceful\ncontemplation of religious matters,\nwhen people renew acquaintances\nand celebrate the birth of our Lord.\nCrap! Christmas is the season when\nwestern society nose dives into a pit\nof opportunist commercialism. It is\nan economic a nomo ly where\neveryone goes apes hit about\nshopping ('Nightmare on Oxford\nStreet'), when big business pushes\nElvis, Santa's Nephew.\nproducts on consumers when their\ndefences are down. This is the time\nwhen our seasonal companies\nemerge, like Brig-o Doon they\nappear magically once a year. For\ninstance, have you ever seen a Ronco advert between January 5th and December 1st? Ronco only exist\nfor one month a year, in which time\nthey sell all their 'useful' items such\nas 'Map-o Meter' or 'Handy Finger\nNail Counter', next year I am\nreliably info med they are bringing\n'out a Christ dec ruc i fier. MB games\nare another yuletide -ria nu fact u rer, producing 'Buckan or 'Twizzler',\ngames which re mans in the shops\nuntil the next Christmas. And then\nwe come to the seasonal music\nscene and that great British\ninstitution K Tel records. Why not\nbuy your lo\\ td one a boxed set of\nslushy songs done by relatives of the\noriginal artist's neighbour? Who\nlistens to 'Christmas Songs' by Val\nDoonican aside from Doonican\nhimself (how many log fires has that\nman got?)?\nOutside the fantasy world of K Tel\nthe usual music monster mutates\nitself in an attempt to emulate K Tel.\nSlade return again, on crutches, to\nonce again sing 'Merry Christmas'\nagain and wave their scarves again\nwhat do they gain? Is this their only\nfunction on this planet? Yes. What\nis the forum for Slade, what is the\nmedium by which they can bid us\ngood tidings so frequently? 'Top of\nthe bloody merry Yuletide Pops\nthat is the twisted creature that is to\nblame. Throughout the year it is a bad programme, filled with\nnauseating rent-a smiles and inane\npseudo-celebrities watching the\nlatest puppets mime to a pre-produced lump of sonic Mills and\nBoon dolly mixture, but it is not\ndisturbing, so it does not bother you\nbecause you can switch it off\n(though now you must not listen to\nthe radio either). However, at\nChristmas Top of the Pops pervades\nall space, it becomes a grotesque\nparody of itself and you cannot\nescape from it, it appears to be on\nall channels at all times. When you\nturn the telly on to watch Blue\nPeter's Chrissy party, where they\nshow you how to build an\nauthentic-looking advent utensil\nusing a Mini Metro and nonflammable tinsel, you find yourself\nseeing Jimmy Saville's tobacco-'Streetcred' Springsteins rendition\nof 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town'.\nCommercialism in music? No, these\nserious artists are singing about\nwhat they believe in. Festive TOTP\nalso includes the statutory 'White\nChristmas' by Bing (is he Val\nDoonican's dad? they have the same\nlog fire) Crosby, the annual David\nEssex emetic dirge and the random\n'nice' song that gets to the top of the\ntinsel-covered charts.\nPerhaps the only thing on TV\nmore obtrusive than Top of the Pops\nat Christmas are the ghosts of\nChristmas past; that is, the four\nfilms which always push their way\nonto the viewing lists in late\nDecember, 'The King and [' with\nDuncan Goodhew in glorious\ntech nicol our, 'The Wizard of Oz'\nstarring Toto in even more glorious\ntech nicol our, a hairy-chested Bond\nfilm and some weak adaptation of\nCharles Dickhead's' A Christmas\nCarol'.\nSpeaking of Christmas carols,\ndon't. They are the epitome of all\nthat is bad about Christmas, and so\nthey should be since they broadcast\nthe whole sordid affair. Everyone\npretends to enjoy them and\npretends not to loathe carol singers\nwho come around during the\n'Morcombe and Wise Yuletide fun\njape programme', all singing the\npopular harmonies and none\nsinging the original tune. Songs\nmutate with each successive\nChristmas. The chief collaborators of\ncarol singers are the brass bands\nwho bus k in awkward places and\n'par p' their way through your least\nfavourite songs (which you have on\nJohn Belushi gets into the festive spirit.\nAn elf.\nthe K Tel Val Doonican log fire\nensemble from last year anyway).\nThis season has a strange mass-brainwashing effect, people actually\nstart to like pantomime. The most\nrepulsive of all Victorian products.\nHow can someone tell themselves\nthat the chirp y cockney Jim\nDavidson's transvestite pan to is\nentertaining? Good old right wing,\nracist, rich Jim Davidson makes a few bob and a tanner for Christmas\nby dressing up in garish bloomers\nand making people vomit\u2014what an\nentrepreneur. Big brothers must be\nlacing the syrupy sherry and mince\npies with some standard-destroying\ndrug.\nOf course some people enjoy the\nChristmas period. Chaps can get\ntogether, get drunk and shout their\nown version of those festive greats.\nIt is simple to substitute rude words\nfor the religious ones and end up\nwith a liver-split tingly funny song\nto spill your drink to.\nIt is impossible to escape from\nChristmas music because all the\naudible media feel it obligatory to\nplay as much as possible\u2014even the\nmighty John Peel succumbs to\ncompiling a festive fifty, and all\nother Radio One DJ's become\nChristmas machines.\nNo one ever says anything against\nthis time of year, it is above criticism\nbecause it is Christmas. Still people\nbuy sty lo phones and socks for\npeople who don't want them and\nwho buy them a dec ruc i fier and\nBuckeroo in return. Still shops put\nout hideous ribbon-dominated\ndisplays in their windows which are\ncornered with spray-on fake snow\n(caustic over-cleaner) and every year\nit gets worse.\nAn outsider might see it as\npunishing ourselves around the\ntime of the great annual turkey-cull.\nJesus and St Nicholas have a lot to\nanswer for.\nPage 30 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Alternative\nNorman\nthe ex-Union Rat\nreturns\nDear Bill,\nHere's a note for your bumper\nChristmas edition which you may\nfind time to read, that is if Liz\nWarren lets you come up for air. It's good to see that at least two\nstudents will be warm during these\nlong, .dark winter nights. After all,\n'tis the season to be jolly, though at\nIC one has to be very jolly indeed\nfor the whopping 19-day 'holiday.'\nChristmas might pass by completely\nunnoticed if the break was any\nshorter. Several people have\nthought of an alternative to holidays\n- sabbatical. This wonderful\ninstitution, taking its name from the I hebrew word 'shaba th', to rest,1\ngives people an opportunity to\nsharpen pencils (Deputy President\nChas Brereton), bon k nurses\n(Honarary Secretary Wendy\nMorris), or wear cheap suits and do\nnothing (Union President Nigel\nBaker).\nIn order to qualify one has to win\nvotes, and here are some tips on\nhow to gain Sab Cred:\n1. The Steph Snell Approach:\nChain yourself to the microphone at\nUGM's. This is similar to Suffragette\ntactics, and every bit as annoying.\n2. The Dream Ticket Approach :\nTeam up with some bona fide hacks\n(The Cosmic Ferret, Dave Williams\n... s hurleys home mistake - Ed ...\netc.) This should have the opposite\neffect to Dan Quayle.\n3. The Literate Approach : Write\nat least two letters per week to Felix.\nThis is the method preferred by\nFrank Leppington, head of the\nMaths Department. Unfortunately\nFrank does not qualify for a sabbatical, but this does not stop\nhim writing a lot of letters.\nOne person who has already\nearned his Sabbatical Holiday\nPackage is now aspiring to greater\nglory. He means to become ULU\npresident, although his wardrobe is\nby Marks and Spencer and he;\ndoesn't give a toss about anything.\nPersonally I don't think Nigel Baker\nwill make it. His last name is a complete non-starter, and his fear of\ngetting his suit damaged during\nprotests (viz. Westminster Bridge)\nseems to throw his manhood into\nquestion.\nIn matters of fashion one has to\nadmire Wendy Morris, my adopted\nfather. His dress sense is impeccable\n- nowadays that is. On taking a trip\nthrough a worm-hole in space-time\nto Wendy's past I found quite a different state of affairs. He was a sorry sight - greasy hair, flares, Doc\nMartins and volcanic acne. A nurse\nwouldn't have looked twice at him.\nPlus ca change, plus c 'est la rae me chose...\nIt is mysterious that \u00a322000 should\nhave gone missing from the\nrefectory. Even more mysterious is\nthe appearance of a red Porsche 924\n(with electric sun-roof) in the garage\nof Mr Northey. These facts may be\nunrelated, but I suspect that they are\nnot. You see, I recently materialized\nin Mr Northey's skirting board\nwhile he was doing some 'creative\naccounting.'\n'Hmmm...\u00a373,000 profit last year.\nThe Porsche is \u00a330,000, electric sunroof \u00a35,000, leather upholstery\n\u00a32000, a garage in Kensington\n\u00a310000 and ten bottles of Bollinger\nto celebrate - that's \u00a347000. I 'll\naccount for it by a clever mixture of\nsalary rises and rising costs, not that\nanyone will read it anyway. Except\nfor the committee, and they can\nhave 4000 each. They'll know\nnothing, they'll see nothing.'\nOne of my favourite hangouts is\nthe HUBby office. For a start they\nleave tasty morsels of cake and ice\ncream on the floor. Eric's always\nthere.\n'Can I have some more cake\nplease?'\n'When I say so, Eric. Don't forget\nwho wears the trousers around\nhere.'\n'Then can we have another party\nwith lots of ice-cream and cake and\na magician who pulls a floppy white\nbunny out of a hat?\n'Shut up,' she said dominantly\nand stuffed some more cake into\nEric's mouth. Then she cracked her\nwhip and sat down to write another\ntome for Felix about her trousers\nand her HUBby office.\nI see that one of Union President's Nigel Baker's favourite haunts is the\nPiano Wire in Soho. After a hard\nday doing nothing, he carefully\ntakes off his Marks and Spencer\nsuit, dons his fish-nets, high heels\nand lacy panties to swanker over to\n'The Club.' He might not be King\nof ULU, but he makes a race Queen. By the way, Nigel, Butch sends her\nlove and so do I, Love,\nNorman (The Ex-Union Rat).\nPhoto glove story\nOne day Wendy and Nigel were in the snack\nbar, burbling happily. 'Eeek,' said Wendy.\nAll of a sudden, in walked Chas. Chas was\njealous. 'Eeek,' moaned Wendy.\n'You bounder,' cried Chas, 'Wendy is mine,\nkeep your hand off her.' 'Eeek,' screamed\nWendy.\n'I challenge you to a duel,' said Nigel. 'You!\ncad,' said Chas, through pouting lips. 'Eeek/\nsaid Wendy.\nAnd so Nigel challenged Chas to eat a croissant at dawn. 'Eeek' said Wendy.\nAs luck would have it Chas choked on a caterpillar. Nigel and Wendy, on the other\nhand, had a lousy weekend in Bognor.\n'Eeek,' said the croissant.\nPage 4 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\n'Well it looks like a Death Star'\nWillow\nEmpire, Leicester Square\nEnter the world of Willow. A world\nof hopes and dreams, myth and\nmagic, good and evil. Forget all you\nknow or think you know.\nGeorge Lucas, master storyteller\nand Star Wars creator presents us\nwith a daring tale of exciting\nadventure, conflict between right\nand wrong, and ultimately the\nvictory of compassion, virtue and\nfriendship.\nThe tale follows a path across a war-torn land of s or cer or s, rebels,\ntrolls and all manner of evil. A mishmash of every previous\nadventure you care to recall is the\nresult, and consequently it is lac ning only in originality.\nIn turn we see elements of The\nHobbit, The Story of Moses, Gulliver's Travels, Raiders of the Lost Arc, Sinbad\nand even The Perils of Penelope\nPitstop. Mostly it is a reworking of\nthe Star Wars trilogy, in story,\ncontent and character is ation. Willow is a dwarf-like creature,\nmember of the Nelwyn race, and\nbudding but un confident s or cer or. His people are primarily farmers\nand mines, and while that may\nsuggest his being Welsh, it reminds\nme of Luke Skywalker.\nHe is aided considerably by\nMadmartigan, an outcast Daikini\nwarrior played by Val Kilmer (Top\nGun). He may look like Mel Gibson\nand act like Kurt Russell, but this\ncharacter is pure Harrison Ford\nmaterial. Han Solo, come on down!\nRomantic interest rears its soppy\nhead in the shape of Sorsha,\ndaughter of evil Queen Bavmorda.\nSacrificed\nYouth\nCert PG, ICA from December 9\nLi, seventeen, a young Chinese girl\nfrom an unspecified 'city', is\nplunged into a completely different\ncountry culture, in the Dai minority\nin China. Arriving in her regulation\njeans and loose grey shirt, she is the\n'educated' girl who doesn't know\nhow to flirt amongst the Dai girls\nwho swim naked in the river, and\npay ten cents a time to look in a full\nlength mirror for twenty seconds.\n'We were taught that beauty lies\nin simplicity' say Li. So, perhaps it\nShe's an evil bitch who gradually\nbecomes entangled with enemy\nMadmartigan as he crusades\naround, ever the dashing\ncompanion, and classic hapless\nrogue.\nElsewhere we see the Emperor,\nDarth Vadar, Obi Wan Kenobi and\nLando Calrissian, loosely disguised,\nand supporting a plot we all know\nbackwards. Even R2-D2 and C3 PO are present, as two argumentative\nnine inch fairies, Rool and\nFrangean. Their timing is superb,\ntheir wit is not. They add little,\ndoes, but she is inhibited by this\ndoctrine, and it is only when she\nadopts the long skirt and bright\ncolours of the Dai girls that she can\ncome to terms with her own\nsensuality.\nSacrificed Youth watches this\ndevelopment, and it is also a tribute\nto the Dai people for whom beauty\nis a way of life.\nThe film is very pretty to look at,\nhowever, it is saved from shallow\nsentiment, and seems not to notice\nthe easy path (trodden by many\nprevious, western film makers) of\npatronising women, seeing them as\nbeauty only. I defy any woman not\nto identify with Li, who buys\nmedical books eagerly at the\nsecondhand stall in the village, and\nhas the authority to walk in and\nsave a boy's life when he is\npoisoned, is surrounded by\nsuper sitio us chanting s and-exorcisms. The dual qualities of\ndetract much and prove to be quite\nirritating.\nWillow is a film with high points\nand low points. Val Kilmer is\nundoubtedly the pinnacle and steals\nthe show. The special effects are\nquite convincing (though the same\nteam have done better), and the\nsets, costume and photography\ncombine to provide a feast for the\neyes.\nThe low points are more difficult\nto single out. The script is weak in\nplaces and some of the acting poor\n(notably Warwick Davies as\nsensuality and intelligence, go hand\nin hand. 'At last', at last, at last' I think it is wonderful to watch.\nIt is easy to identify with Li.\nArriving in her blue jeans and flat\nblack pumps, she could be any\nEuropean kid, suddenly swept into\nan alien culture, this helps make\nSacrificed Youth very accessible to\nwestern eyes. As close to Li's almost\ncomplete conversion to the Dai way,\nwe have Ren Jia, a young man in the\nsame situation as Li, but who will\nnot accept his new lifestyle. It is he\nwho points out that the Dai girls\nhave their 'fun' for only a few years,\nand then they are married and then\nblack-toothed grannies...but it is he,\nalso, who laments the upbringing\nthat had made him unable to\nexpress his feelings directly. They\nhave been raised in a 'sophisticated'\nfashion, and have lost the\nspontaneity and instinctive ness of\nyouth.\nWillow). There is a general feeling\nof incompleteness, and the movie\nremains shallow. It needs more\nnovelty to offer any challenge to Star\nWars, and to be frank it could never\nparallel the true masterpiece.\nWillow is the perfect film for taking\nyoung relatives to see this\nChristmas. It's a mixture of fun,\nexcitement and fantasy. Bu then so\nis Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and that\nis quite simply more entertaining.\nAndrew Clarke.\nThe conflicts between these two\ncultures are not labour ed, and the\nstoryline is quite absorbing. It is easy\nto draw parallels between what is on\nscreen and one's own life, helping\nus to examine our own attitudes and\nconsider our own personalities, this\nis the most important contribution\nthat cinema has to make to the\nconsumer, aside from sheer\nentertainment.\nBeauty in Sacrificed Youth is an\ninherent quality. Because of this,\nevery character has their own\ndignity. The acting is well-mannered and natural, the\nphotography pleasing and the film,\nas a whole, well put together,\nflowing with warmth and implicit\nhumour. This has to be worth 96\nminutes of anybody's precious time.\nSusan Appleby.\n(Sacrificed Youth is in Chinese with\nEnglish subtitles.)\nPage 34 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

See St\nMary's Med School for details,\ntickets available at lunchtimes.\nby Dave Williams\nOn Tuesday the sixth of December\nat 3.38pm at the Tower of London\nPier, the mascots of City & Guilds\nCollege Union, Spanner and Bolt,\nwere exchanged with the Royal\nCollege of Science Union for a cheque for \u00a31,100.\nThe Vice Presidents of the\nrespective unions shook hands and\nthe deal was done, C& GU had\nregained po cession of their long lost\nmascots.\nThis is the true, public image of\nmascot ry, the story that should be\nhitting the headlines.. Mascotry is\nsolely concerned with raising money\nfor charity and maintaining the\npride of one's own college by\npreventing the loss of one's own\nmascot. This often results in some\nhair-raising moments and massive\nadrenal in surges, but in the end it's all good honest, clean fun as any\nmascot e er will tell you.\nThe current tale of Spanner and\nBolt all started back on the 22nd of\nMarch last year, C& GU had just\nfinished holding their elections\nUGM. Naturally the mascots had\nbeen in attendance as had a rival\nmascot ry team from the Royal\nCollege of Science. Plans were afoot\nand two taxis containing RCS men\nattempted to follow the car in which\nSpanner and Bolt were leaving\nCollege. The first taxi was soon\nspotted and lost quickly by the\nGuild's car. Not thinking anything\nwas amiss, the C&G UGM departed\nquickly to the Queen's Arms to\ncelebrate the successes of the\nelections.\nHowever, doom lay on the\nhorizon, for, in the car with Spanner\nand Bolt, was an RCS man closely\ncovered by another RCS man in the\nsecond taxi.\nAfter following a random route\naround the backstreet s of London,\nthe car returned to the College area,\nj dropping its occupants at the\n[Queen's Arms. The car and mascots\nthen went for another little wander\nbefore being parked behind\nLinstead. Due to skillful driving by\nthe second taxi driver, the RCS man\nwas still behind the Guild's car,\nwatching all that went on. With this\ninformation of the location of the\nmascots, the RCS soon gained\naccess to the car boot.\nA sense of excitement swept\naround those present, somewhat\nakin to the thrill of finding the Holy\nGrail. The RCS wasted no time in\nspeeding off into the distance and\nsafety, later returning to the bar to\ncelebrate.\nBecause of impending exams in\nthe following term both sides\ndecided that the recovery tasks were\nbest left until the new year. This\nterm has thus seen extensive\noperations by C& GU in carrying out\na number of tasks set by RCS.\nThe term started with the C&G executive officers offering to show\ntheir knees for 50p. This was very\nsuccessful and resulted in a very\nstrange response from the Rector.\nThe Guild's scarf was also strung\nacross Beit Quad welcoming the\nfresher s to IC. Later that week\nGuilds collected on their fresher s' pub crawl, whilst the C&G exec,\ntastefully dressed themselves as the\nRCSU mascot, Theta.\nDressed in drag at RCS Freshers'\nBar Night, Guilds were told that the\nfollowing week they were expected\nto 'bus k' outside Mech Eng. Here\nwe discovered not only could\nGuilds juggle the books, but they\ncould juggle tennis balls as well.\nThe human coffee machine in the\nJCR is best left un mentioned, but is\nincluded for completeness as people\nliked and trusted the automatic\nmachines far more.\nWe were soon to see several\nmembers of Guild's Motor Club\nquickly moving, repairing and\nlocking cars, as C&G were told to\norganise a scrap metal collection\naround College.\nIt was now getting close to\nChristmas so it was decided to send\nC& GU off to Leicester Square, carol\nsinging. Unfortunately, the noise\nwas so bad that they were moved\non by the police. Later Guilds were\nsent into the College car park, first\nwashing cars and then charging staff\na nominal fee for entry in the\nmorning. We must not forget that\neveryone who bought a pizza at the\nBeer Festival was helping to raise\nmoney for the recovery fund.\nAll this brings us to Tuesday,\nDecember 6th. After being told to\nmake themselves available, the\nGuild's Office received a telephone\ncall at 11.50am telling them to go to\na telephone box for further\ninstructions, then another box, and\nthen another...finally, after spelling\nRCS across a map of London, they\narrived at the Tower of London\nwhere the mascots were finally\nreturned.\nThere used to be a time when each\nCollege with ir. the University of\nLondon partook in the thrills of\nmascot ry. It now is left as almost the\nsole duty of the colleges of IC and\nthe medical schools.\nA number of London colleges still\nkeep mascots; these include Queen\nMary College (a large plaster\nleopard), Kings College (a6001b concrete and brass lion), St\nBartholemew Hospital (a very large\npenguin made from beer barrels),\nCity University (a concrete carrot).\nThough they are mascots and all\nviolate (ie they don't mind being\nstolen) the colleges themselves\ndon't have active teams who are out\nto steal other mascots. Even\nImperial College has a mascot, Mike\nthe Micrometer, which is\noccasionally seen at UGM's, if the\nDeputy President can be bothered\nto bring it out. It is a fully working\nmicrometer and until it was\ndropped by a team from QMC, was\naccurate to 10,000th of an inch. This\nmascot was built in 1966 to replace\nthe previous violate mascot of ICU,\nHerbert the Phoenix (hence the\nphoenix on your Union card).\nHerbert was named after IC's most\nfamous alumni, HG Wells. He was\nlost in 1964 to persons unknown,\nand nothing has been seen of him\never since. Mike was constructed\njointly by the CCU's, being cast in\nthe Mines, machined in Guilds and\ncalibrated by the RCS.\nThere is a strong 'spirit' within\nmascot ry, as it is very much a team\ngame. There are rules which are\nmeant to ensure people don't just\nbeat up each other to gain po session of a mascot. All the best and most\nsuccessful raids have employed\ncunning or just plain opportunism\nat the ineptitude of the opposition.\nMascotry at IC has come under\ncriticism over recent years, many\nseeing it as trivial and an excuse for\na bunch of hacks to be even more\nimportant. Hopefully the \u00a31,100\nraised for Great Ormond Street\nHospital by the theft of Spanner and\nBolt will raise interest and action\ninto an activity which receives no\nfinancial support from the unions,\nand yet is fun, exciting and very\nworthwhile.\nDave Williams,\nRCS Vice President.\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 31\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nLife: a meaning\nSheldrake is one of of several to mix\nbiology with philosophy/religion\nothers being the Gaia Hypothesis\nand Creationism.\nThe crux of this argument is in his\nideas on creativity where he talks of\nthings from below and above and\nintroduces oriental mystical ideas.\nLike Creationists before him he has\na set of spiritual beliefs that he is\ntrying to substantiate in scientific\nterms and is trying to prove a 'God'\nin scientific theories. Such science\nis often of a low quality, being based\non poor methodology, equivocal\nevidence and tenuous interpretation\nof data, eg the decay of the speed\nof light curve wildly exaggerated by\nCreationists and used with doubts\nover carbon dating to show how the\ngeological time scale can be 'fitted'\nto the Biblical one.\nMust science and religion be\nconcurrent, non-overlapping facets\nof life leaving those with views on\nboth in an almost intellectually\n'schizophrenic' state? It is obvious\nthat Sheldrake has based his\nthinking^ on observed biological\nphenomenon with, as yet, no\nunequivocal explanation and has\nused his the o soph ical ideas based\naround mysticism to explain these\nphenomena in a supposedly\nscientific manner. There are current\nmoves in Islamic circles to put\nforward Islamic interpretations of\nscience and conversely Christian\nScientists and Scientologists have\ntried to view God in scientific terms.\nHowever, in all honesty if the role\nof science is to provide an objective\nanalysis of the natural world by an\nexperimental hypothesis method\nthen it is not possible to view it in\na religious dimension as such a dimension cannot be objectively\nassessed. This is not, however, to\nsay that the spiritual dimension is\nworthless, rather the areas should\n0*\nbe viewed in their own right and\nany overlap or interplay between\nthem should be restricted to the\nphilosophical and not the scientific\nrealm. Indeed, instead of seeing\nscience and religion as being\ncontradictory as is often the case,\nthey may instead be seen as\ncomplementary facets of life.\nOne can in some ways sym pathis e with Sheldrake for challenging\ncurrent biological thinking. That\noften mentioned concept of\nscientific inertia does in many ways\nplague biology. Evolution is often\ntaught as fact and not theory and\nprogress is often hindered by\noutdated classifications and schools\nof thought.\nScience, instead, must be seen in\na more dynamic and equivocal\nmanner with a greater exchange of\nideas and more critical examination\nof ideas and facts.\nChristmas Shopping This once a year pastime need no\nlonger be a boring drag, as with the\naid of your FELIX guide we hope to\nbring some fun into this event.\nA mere ten minute walk from\nCollege is that rather famous place\n'Harold' where the OK Ya! from\n'Clarm' go shopping. However, it\nis not as an expensive rip-off as\nmany believe and is definitely worth\na visit. First head for the food hall\nand get a little Christmas spirit with\nHarrods own 15 year-old malt\nwhisky at a mere \u00a315.20. In the\nconfection ary section a marzipan\nFather Christmas can be found for\na fiver and a large hand-made sweet\nselection in a basket for \u00a340. On\npassing through to the Edwardian\nChristmas section don't miss the\nthree foot high 'Hansel & Gretel'\nhouse made of gingerbread and\nmarzipan and the Edwardian\nexhibition itself is quaintly pleasant\nand interesting. Finally for Harry\nit's up to the top floor for the toy\ni section passing the half hour queue\nfor the Edwardian circus en route.\nHere you'll find every Motor Club\nmember's dream: a Ferrari Testarosa\nscaled down to a kiddies version,\nfully working with petrol engine\u2014\na snip at \u00a312,500.\nNow fight your way down to\nKnightsbridge tube as the next stop\nis Piccadilly Circus and Tower\nRecords where some off beat stuff\nwas discovered. Take Bing Crosby\nand White Christmas for \u00a32.49 (give\nit to Grandma) give all science\nfiction bugs the Dr Who theme\ni music for \u00a35.29, for Monty Python\nfans 'The Life of Brian' soundtrack\nat \u00a36.99 and for the more nostalgic,\n'Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club\nBand' is \u00a36.99.\nNext head up Regent Street and\nyou'll pass Dunn and Co where you\nScottish beret for a Hogmany Party\nis \u00a37 and if you're fed up of your\nfather's seventies kipper ties buy\nhim a 'Christmas wrapping paper'\nsilk one from the Tie Rack (\u00a312.99).\nOf course, Hamley's had to be\nvisited\u2014everyone is a kid at heart.\nFor those keen academics, a chemistry set is approximately \u00a320,\nand electronics set (level 3)\u2014\u00a369 and\na Merit microscope and slide set for\n\u00a339. For the stupid hacks in the\nUnion, who can't walk home\nstraight after a party without falling\nover a baby walker at \u00a325 might be\nuseful.\n. A right hand c ii ve is io ii into\nCarnaby Street is worth it for those\ninto their fashions but it is not cheap\nand it's Christmas decorations are\nawful. However, nip up to Great\nMarlborough Street and the Poster\nShop and for the richer among you\nAndy Warhol's 'Cars' posters in\ncolour (A2 size) at \u00a327 are\nrecommended. Just down the road\nfrom here is Liberty's with a distinct\nmedieval Christmas flavour and\nsome good press ies for the ladies.\nOn approaching Oxford Street\nbeware of the monster raving loony\ntraffic wardens with megaphones\nacting as an advanced form of\nlollipop person! Oxford Street is\nlong and bland consisting of mainly\nclothes shops but there are a few\ngems. For U2 addicts still minus a rattling hum, \u00a36.99 at Virgin is the\ncheapest. While in the maiden shop,\nif you have any well cool friends, get\nthem Acid Beats 2 at \u00a36.40 for the\nlatest in LSD bops. Selfridges' book\nsection has 'The Snowman' by\nRaymond Briggs (\u00a36.95) and a good\nafter dinner read especially for\nIndsoc members) is Norman\nTebbit's 'Upwardly Mobile'. While\nyou're there go and see Father\nChristmas as well. Athena has\n'Beach Party\u2014the last resort' at \u00a34\ni with plenty of useful ideas as to\ni being a Costa del Thug.\nAt last Athena has two presents\nfor our beloved President Nigel\nBaker: 'The Noddy Treasury' (\u00a38)\nand the\n89 'Bros' annual (\u00a35) which\ncombined with the 'Bros Chistmas\nGift Box' from Tower Records at\n\u00a39.99 should make Nige's Christmas\none of ec stacy. However, if the real life spoofs\ncalled Nige, Chas and Wendy aren't good enough then play the 'Spitting\nImage Game' from Virgin (\u00a312.99).\nA quick per am bulat ion down Charing Cross Road and\nLong Acre and you hit Covent\nGarden. Excellent for Christmas\ncoffee on the plaza it has an\nauthentic festive spirit\ncomplemented with fairground\nrides. If the shopping's hitting a rut,\nhead for the General Store where\nsomething for everyone should be\nfound for a few quid.\nDave Thomas\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "Alternative\nA Christmas B Arthur Michael was dead. There is\nno doubt whatever about that. The\nregister was signed by the\nclergyman, the clerk, the\nundertaker, and the chief mourner.\nDerek signed it. And Derek's name\nwas good upon anything he chose\nto put his hand to. Old Arthur\nMichael was dead as a door-nail.\nDid Derek know he was dead? Of\ncourse he did. How could it be\notherwise? Derek and he were\npartners for I don't know how many\nyears. Derek was his sole ex rif ut or, his sole administrator, his sole\nfriend, and sole mourner.\nDerek never painted out old\nMichael's name. There it stood,\nyears after, above the fortress door:\nDash and Michael. The firm was\nknown as Dash and Michael.\nSometimes citizens new to\nCheapskate called Dash Dash,\nsometimes Michael, but he\nanswered to both names. It was all\nthe same to him.\nOnce upon a time\u2014of all the good\ndays in the year, on Christmas\nEve\u2014Derek sat busy in the Surefield\nfortress. It was cold, bleak, biting\nweather: foggy as well: and he\ncould hear the citizens outside,\nwheezing up and down, beating\ntheir hands against their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the\nwalkway to warm them. The\nCheapskate clocks had only just\ngone three\u2014or were just about to,\ndepending on which clock you were\nlooking at\u2014but it was already dark.\nLights were burning in the\nneighbouring offices, as computers\nsat idly around like cherries for the\npicking.\nThe door of Derek's office was\nopen that he might keep his eye\nupon his secretary, John Cratchit,\nwho, in a dismal little cell beyond,\nwas copying letters. Derek had a small fire, but the secretary's was so\nvery much smaller that it looked like\na single lump of coal. But he\ncouldn't replenish it, for Derek kept\nthe coal in his own office; and so\nsurely as the secretary came in and\ntried to warm himself on the\ncomputer, but it was gone.\n'A merry Christmas!' cried a cheerful voice. It was Derek's wife\nMad Dash, who had come upon\nhim so quickly that this was the first\nintimation of her approach.\n'Bah!', said Derek, 'Humbug!'\nMad had so heated herself at the\nChristmas Caper that she was all in\na glow\n'Christmas a huai bug, dear, you\ndon't mean that I'm sure.'\nT do. Out with merry Christmas!\nWhat's Christmas but a time for\npaying bills without money, a time\nfor finding yourself a year older but\nnot an hour richer. If I had my way,\nevery idiot who goes round with\n'Merry Christmas' on his lips would\nbe boiled with his own pudding,\nand buried with a stake of holly\nthrough his heart.'\n'Derek!' pleaded Mad.\n'Mad' returned Derek s| 'keep Christmas in your\nme keep it in mine.'\nDerek took his d in ri McNorthey's tavern, art c Kha read all the quality^,\nhome to 170.\nNow, it is a fact, that there was\nnothing exceptional about the\nknocker on the door, except that it\nwas very large. As Derek\nhis key in the lock of the\nsaw in the knocker Arthur\npiggy little face. To say that\nnot startled would be uni\npaused as he opened the door, half\nexpecting to see Arthur's pigtail\nsticking out from the other side of\nthe door into the hall. But there was\nnothing, and Derek closed it with a bang that resounded around the\nhouse like thunder. He went\nupstairs to his room, put on his\ndressing gown, slippers and\nnightcap. Then he heard a sound.\nA clanking noise, as if someone\nwere drag giri ga chain over casks in\nthe wine cellar. The he heard the\nnoise on the floors below, then\ncoming up the stairs. 'It's humbug\nstill, and I won't believe it,' said\nDerek, remembering how ghosts\nwere described as dragging chains.\nHis colour changed when it walked\nthrough the door and stood in front\nof him. T know him, it's Arthur\nMichael!'\n'Can you sit down?' Derek asked,\nlooking doubtfully at him.\nThe ghost sat down, giving his\nchains a frightful rattle.\n'Why do you trouble me Arthur?'\n'I. wear a chain I forged in life. I have come to warn you that you\nbear a chain heavier and longer than\nthis. I am here to warn you that vo u yet have a chance of escaping my\nfate. You will be visited by three\nclowns. You cannot hope to shun\nthe path I tread unless you meet\nthem. Expect the first tomorrow at\none.' With this the ghost left, arid\nDerek instantly fell asleep.\nDerek awoke. Michael's ghost had\nbothered him exceedingly. WaStRd\ndream? It was almost the hour for\nthe first clown to visit. At the\nappointed time the curtains were\ndrawn aside and a short little man\nappeared. T am the clown of\nChristmas Past' said the spirit. It put\nout its hand, clasped Derek by the\narm and led him fro iri the house.\nDerek recognised the place they\nwent to. It was still Cheapskate, but\nit was strangely different. There\nwere lots of computers for a start.\n~ ere k to a room\n, a solitary citizen,\nreading a book. Derek recognised\nhimself as the citizen. Then some\ncited\nTeat party, with food\ni lent y. Derek watched\nself entered into the\nwith the rest of the\nthe spirit led him\ni several more festive\ntig s in Derek's past, before\nhe pleaded with the spirit to be\ntaken home.\nAwaking again, Derek had no\nneed to be told that the hour was\nonce again upon him. He saw a strange light in the next room, and\nventured to investigate. It was his\nown room. In it stood a tall, ugly,\nrugby player. T am the clown of\nChristmas Present' he said.\n'I went forth . last night on\ncompulsion' said Derek, 'Tonight,\nif you have anything to teach me\nthen let me profit by it.'\nThe clown took his arm and led\nhim downstairs. There were people\ntalking, laughing and having a good\ntime. Derek recognised them a? citizens at the Lumpsofmetahvorshippers Cocktail Party. 'Why are\nthey so happy?' asked Derek,\n'They're so poor.'\n'Well, you see' the clown replied,\n'They may be poor, overdrawn and\nliving in run down, gro tty flats,\npaying extortionate rents, but they\nstill accept any excuse to dress up\nand have a good time.'\nThen the clown grasped his arm\nand moved him on. He took him to\nthe house of Cratchits. Wendy\nCratchit was cooking the Christmas\ndinner. Her two sons, Chas and Bill\nwere laying the table. At that\nmoment in came their father, John\nCratchit, with Tiny Nigel on his\nshoulder. Alas for Tiny Nigel, he\nhad his limbs supported by an iron\nframe and bore a tiny crutch. They\nwere a happy family, a Derek kept\nlius eye on Tiny Nigel until the\nclown beckoned him to leave. Derek\nre tur end to his room and as the\ncl bc||i struck twelve the clown\ndisappeared, to be replaced by an\neven more fearsome sight. A massive woman stood before him.\nT am the clown of Christmas yet to\ncome!' she bellowed, putting more\ndread into Derek than even he\nthought possible, she led him away\nto the Cratchits' house. It was quiet,\nvery quiet. The noisy little Cratchits\nwere as still as statues in the corner.\nIn the other comer lay a tiny crutch,\nno unused. 'Oh clown' begged\nDerek, 'tell me it isn't so, where is\nTiny Nigel?' The spirit beckoned\nDerek to the dresser, to an opened\ndrawer. In it there lay a bank\nstatement. Derek read it. 'Spirit, is\nthis how it will be? Tiny Nigel will\nbe forced to drop out because he\ncan't afford to study at Cheapskate?'\nThe spirit said nothing, but took\nDerek back to his room, and left him\nto sleep.\nDerek scrambled out of bed. He\nwas so fluttered and glowing that he\nran out into the street and stopped\nthe first citizen he met. 'What's today?' asked Derek. 'Why,\nChristmas Day' replied the citizen.\nT haven't missed it' thought\nDerek, 'the clowns ha vd done their\nwork in one night.

    "content": "News Review...News Review....News Review...\nIf one is to use the benefit of\nhindsight to review the news from\nthe last ten issues of FELIX, what\nbecomes apparent from the eighty\nor so items is that accommodation\nand top-up loans occur most\nfrequently. The same would be true\nfor any college this term and will\nsurprise few people, however\nFELIX continued to report other\nrelevant issues such as collapsing\nceilings, computer thefts, merger\nnegotiations and the demise of\nNorman the Rat. Does anything\never change at Imperial?\nThe most important story of the\nterm started, when Kenneth Baker\nvisited the College in late October\nfor informal discussions with the\nRector, Professor Ash and with t 'chosen few' students. The visit was\nnot publicised and remained a low-key affair, but Mr Baker revealed his\nintentions to introduce top-up loans\nKenneth Baker's loans\nin a White Paper. He was\nquestioned on the plans for\nCommunity Charge and replied that\nstudents would receive an 80%\nrebate against the actual charge that\nis paid when the system is\nintroduced in 1990. He also\nadmitted it would also lead to a'd is entitlement to benefit' but added\nthat the generous terms of the loans\nwould compensate for the loss.\nThe 'education debate' as it\nbecame known in the media, was\nworking up to fever pit ich, with\ncon travers i al statements by Lord\nChilver adding fuel to the fire. Lord\nChilver became chairman of the\nUniversities Funding Council\n(UFC), the body which replaced the\nUGC, and is vice-chancellor of\nCranfield Institute of Technology.\nAn interview with The Times Higher\nEducation Supplement reported that\nhe believed the principle on which\neligibility to enter higher education\nis governed should be 'the student's willingness to commit his or her\nown resources to gaining that\neducation'.\nThe second week of November\nsaw the publication of the now\ninfamous White Paper on 'Top Up\nLoans.' The full story was reported\nin FELIX within one day of its\npublication.\nThe report bases a student's requirements on a national income\nsurvey and allocates \u00a31179 for rent\nin London\u2014equivalent to \u00a330 in 39\nweeks. Imperial students in 1990\nwill borrow \u00a3460 per year (\u00a3340 in\ntheir final year) and will no longer\nbe entitled to housing benefit.\nThis daunting prospect caused\nfifteen thousand students (including\nnearly 30 from IC) to assemble on\nWestminster Bridge to demonstrate.\nViolent scenes were widely reported\nas the demonstration deteriorated\ninto a pit i ched battle. Students'\nUnions blamed confrontational\ntactics of the Socialist Workers Party\nstudents and he,a vy handed\npolicing.\nThe student loans debate\ncontinues at IC\u2014an extraordinary\nmeeting of the Union last Thursday\nagreed to protest with a Collegewide ballot and petition.\nStudents may well be short of\nmoney after 1990 but will feel lucky\nif they have a roof over their heads.\nAccommodation problems have\njeen reported almost every week in\nFELIX.\nThe Freshers' issue recorded the\nmerger of Mining and Southwell\nHouses in Evelyn Gardens, the new\nhall is still named Southwell as\nplans to call it 'Monk Hall' were\ndropped. The College gambled \u00a31.6\nmillion buying 'Olave House' from\nthe Girl Guide Association. Most of\nthe money for this purchase comes\nfrom a loan, the repayments for\nwhich would require rents of \u00a3100\nper week for each room. The\nCollege can only charge, a more\nrealistic, \u00a355 per week and Mr John\nSmith is hoping mortgage interest\nrates decrease soon. Hamlet\n\u00a31.6 million\nspeculation\nGardens was damaged by squatters\nagain last summer, this time causing\nseveral thousand pounds worth of\ndamage. The infamous Bernard\nSunley House received a \u00a3530,000\nupgrade of three of the five houses\nbringing it in line with local\nauthority requirements.\nThe College reconsidered damage\ncharges made against former\noccupants of Lexham Gardens. The\nHead Tenancies were returned to\ntheir landlord with \u00a38,362 in\ndamage charges.\nA rent strike was looming in mid-October after Fisher Hall residents\nclaimed they had been misled over\nthe rents, followed by Beit Hall\nresidents also angry at the College's decision to charge a week's rent for\nthe Christmas vacation. Union\nHonorary Secretary, Ian Morris,'-':\nproposed a motion in late October\nto the College Governing Body that\nrents should be sub sidi sed from\nfunds from overseas students.\nThis proposal was later echoed by\nCollege Secretary John Smith,\narguing for a transfer of funds from\nacademic to the residence accounts.\nHe produced a paper suggesting\nthat money from overseas students'\nfees could be used but realised it\nmay meet opposition since they are\nnot always guaranteed a place in\nHall.\nCeilings have collapsed twice in\nEvelyn Gardens this term,\nfortunately not injuring any of the\nroom's inhabitants. Managing\nSurveyor of Residences, Peter\nHallworth, claimed it was the result\nof dampness caused by students\nfilling baths to the rim before getting\nin. He also stated that students were\nin no danger despite the three\ncollapses in the last two years.\nMontpelier Hall and 170\nQueensgate were up for sale this\nterm, the latter, however, the result\nof a QT Society spoof\nCollapsing\nceilings\nadvertisement. Montpelier, which\nrequires a \u00a3230,000 upgrade, failed\nto receive any bids in the \u00a35 million\nregion, which could enable the\nCollege to purchase a suitable\nalternative hall and sale plans were\nscrapped.\nOn October 19th College officially\nmerged with St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School at a ceremony\nattended by HRH the Princess\nRoyal. In the same week it was\nannounced talks had begun on a merger with the Royal Holloway\nand Bedford New College. Plans for\nthe merger suggest the\naccommodation problems could be\nsolved since undergraduates would\nlive at the RHBNC site of Egham in\nSurrey. Professor Ash is also known\nto be keen on a strong arts and\nhumanities department for IC. The\nUniversities Funding Council\nagreed. to fund such a merger\nbetween RHBNC and IC fueling\nsp eo ul ation that it is likely to go\nahead. Royal Holloway and Bedford\nNew College have received publicity\nafter their Governing Council\nproposed to sell their Holloway\npicture collection. The College faces\ninsolvency in 1990.\nIt's not all doom and gloom for\nstudents though. Rag Week has\nraised over \u00a37,500 but without Chas\nBrereton's piano marathon during\nwhich \u00a31,500 was collected for\ncharity last year the figure is less\nthan before. Tiddly Winks down\nOxford Street in Freshers' Week\nraised \u00a32698. The Rag Mag has\nfinally been produced under the\neditorship of David Williams though\nnot without problems from the\nCensorship Committee who found\nsome of the jokes distasteful.\nRag Mag tasteful\njokes\nThe College continued suffering\nfrom a spate of computer thefts\nwhich are believed to have cost\ninsurers about \u00a3150,000. The Rector's computer, worth \u00a36,000 was\nstolen from his Electrical\nEngineering office over the summer and since then thefts have occured in Mechanical Engineering\nand the School of Management.\nCollege Security believe the\nthieves have access to pass keys\nand may include a member of\nstaff.\nThe Main Dining Hall received\na refurbishment costing \u00a3300,000\nand made a loss of \u00a322,000 in the\nlast financial year. In the year\n1986-87 a gross trading profit of\n\u00a373000 was made. FELIX reported\nthat changes made to the lighting\nplans by the Rector's wife pushed the cost up by \u00a330,000. Mr Rob\nNorthey's empire was also\nfeatured in the news pages when\nit transpired that sales of salads by\nweight, in The Gardens, was il-legal. The Union Snack Bar, also\nfamous for its loss making ac-ti vi ties, received a refit costing\n\u00a340000 and the attention of\nmanagement consultants.\nThe Debating Society held the\nmost contentious meetings this\nterm with speakers on the subject\nof 'A Future for South Africa'.\nEnoch Powell,the former MP\nspoke to the HG Wells Society on\nthe subject of 'Textural Criticism\nof the Old Testament'. Mr Powell\nis also famous for his political\nviews.\nFinally, there were red faces all\nround in Mechanical Enginering\nwhere ,a giant candle is being\nbuilt for charity. Firstly the wick\nwas dropped to the bottom of the\n10m mould, and now it appears\nan error must have been made in\nthe heat transfer calculations, as\nthe candle may not solidify in\ntime for the lighting ceremony in\nHyde Park!\nFELIX staff would like to wish\nyou all a Happy Christmas.\nPage 36 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

Incidentally Bill Morgan's father was at IC as a student in the Aero\nDepartment..so he tells me.) If so then a line to\nme, via FELIX or MSF Office, Sherfield Building,\nwould be warmly welcomed.\nHarry Fairbrother.\nSuntan Health\nShock\nDear Editor,\nI was rather surprised to read of the proposal\nto include a solarium in the new College 'Health'\nClub (FELIX 819). I had hoped that the desire of\nthe young and fair-skinned to burn their bodies\nto a frazzle was on the wane; but it would seem\nthat no 'Health' Club is complete without the sun\nlamp, which imparts neither health nor vigour,\nexcept when used to treat a few medical\nconditions under qualified supervision. For some\nunfortunate individuals the consequences of an\nartificially maintained year-round tan are\npremature ageing of the skin and/or skin cancer.\nI think you would be hard-pushed to find a dermatologist who would approve of even the\nnewer so-called safer sun lamps for purely\ncosmetic purposes.\nSun worshippers may argue that tanning is\nharmless if practiced in moderation, and indeed\nnot everyone with a fair skin who spends a lifetime in a sunny climate develops skin cancer,\njust as many people at our chillier latitude do,\nand sometimes on parts of their bodies usually\nprotected by clothing. There is no way I know\nof determining a 'safe' level of exposure to natural\nor artificial sunlight for any individual, but some\ngeneralisations may be made.\n1. The fairer your skin, the greater the risk.\n2. Skin cancers are extremely common forms\nof cancer in Caucasians in sunny countries such\nas Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n3. The most common site affected is the face,\nas this is usually constantly exposed to sunlight,\nand the people affected are often those who work\npr spend their leisure time out of doors.\nI would like to stress that I am not suggesting that\n.we should hide from the sun which is necessary\nto both our physical and emotional well-being.\ni But I do feel we should avoid additional 'out of\ni season' tanning, by natural or artificial means.\nT also feel we should not seek to perpetuate the\nmyth that unlimited tanning is healthy, as distinct\nfrom an exercise in vanity, by filling our Health\nGyms with solaria.\nYours faithfully,\nAlison Davies, Library Assistant, Geology Library,\nformerly staff nurse at the Department of Radiotherapy, North Middlesex Hospital.\nPS.

Companies and students\n' always comment on how well it is run and a large\nprofit is made.\nIn past years this has gone to pay for events,\n'but this year the Union is taking \u00a38,000 of the\n' profit while Indsoc receives \u00a32000.\nThe Union has not organised the Careers Fair\n\u2022and Indsoc has provided all the manpower.\n\u2022 In your article you stated that \u00a32000 was to be\n\u2022 spent on a dinner. This is incorrect, in fact, \u00a3400\n\u2022 was spent on a dinner for 15 people at \u00a325 per\nhead. This expenditure was specifically approved\n. by Nigel Baker prior to the fair although he now\n.seems to have changed his mind.\nAs a Committee we felt that it would be wrong\nto pay ourselves so we decided instead on a dinner. This was open to anybody who came and\n{put in forty hours works over four days consisting\nof Monday afternoon and evening as well as\ntwelve hours each day on Tuesday, Wednesday\nand Thursday. Only one non-committee member\ndid so, although it wasn't Chas Brereton, who\n'tried to invite himself along.\nTo conclude, our dinner was in payment for\na minimum of forty hours work, and that doesn'ti include the previous nine months organisational\n'effort put in by Indsoc and I deeply resent the\ninsinuation that we had a piss-up at ICU's 'expense.\nIf we were to be paid properly then we would\n\u2022 each receive over \u00a380, but we didn't request this\n.as the whole aim is to raise money for Indsoc\nmembers' benefit.\nPlease get your facts straight before you start\nmaking allegations.\nYours,\nS] McCali, Elec Eng 2\nMilk\nDear Bill,\n30/11/88\nThe R CSU Office is the one place I know,\nwhere anomalies appear regularly in the\neveryday running of life. It is also a place where\nis to un ding feats of creativity are instituted,\ni very day one or the other of these things is\n;u ar anteed to occur.\nToday, it is the appearance of around four\nhundred pints of milk. The milk is stored in40 j pint containers. But, how the milk is contained,\n\u2022and in what manner it arrived, are of little\n(consequence. That is, these questions take no\nprecedence in the minds of the people of the RCS,\nwho now have to figure out what to do with this\nquantity of milk. It didn't take them long to figure\nout that they can't drink it all. Not even if they\nLetters\ni ave no other form of nourishment for the next\nive days. (Five days is the limit that I put on the\nmilk staying fresh!)\nOne hack I spoke to had written his name on one of the containers. 'That's mine!' he said. He\n\u2022claimed that he was going to drink it all. I pointed\n-out that he had three days to the sell-by date, and\n.that the container was larger than his torso. 'Well,\nI'm going to buy lots of breakfast cereal.' Was\n.the convincing reply.\nAn attempt has been made to sell over the\nphone a large quantity of milk to the various\nrefectories and food outlets around College, with\n\u2022some success it seems! Although, some form of\n[explanation was found to be necessary before the\npotential buyers would take the offer seriously.\n| Does anyone fancy a milk drinking competition?

    "content": "Why Indsoc\nMust Go Ex-FELIX Editor Steve Marshall expresses\nhis opinion on the Industrial Society in a feature ripped out ot a1985 FELIX\nHave you noticed there is a new and ever more\ncomplacent type of student\nat IC? Collectively they are\nknown as the Industrial\nSociety. But what is it and\nwhat are its aims? It\npostures and camouflages\nif self as a Union club but it\ncomes from outside and is\nultimately controlled by\nthose who would seek to\nbulldoze students into a career in industry before\nthey have had the chance\nto freely reflect and form\nopinions of their own about\nthe desirability of such a career. And it does f his by\nclandestinely getting its\nfinger in the pie three years\nbefore there's anything like\na reason to justify it. I would like to take the\nopportunity of presenting\nhere a few personal\nopinions of such a trend,\nwhich I see as yet another\nnail in the coffin of Imperial\nCollege and a gradual\nwhittling away of a free and\nunprejudiced student area\nin which to learn, have fun\nand mould opinions and\nideas as the bedrock of any\nfuture thought about\nanything and everything.\nIn my time I have\ndigested much of the\nambience of Imperial\nCollege and hence\nformulated more than a few\nviews about it, and, in\nparticular, I have probed its\ndullness to the hilt, and its\nappalling sparsity of\ninsight. About its root\ncause? A complete lack of\nany kind of creatively\nrebellious element on\ncampus. But, I feel, as ever,\nthat things can always be\nchanged and so here are\nsome views I should like to\ndisseminate amongst you.\nFor a start, let's face it\nthat the students who run\nIndustrial Society are a rare\nbreed indeed, though,\nun for tu at ely, far from\nextinct. They are people\nwho spontaneously\nejaculate with emotion at\nthe prospect of a new\nforeclosure and being 'in\nthe know' about an exciting\nnew merger. But we all\nknow that industry is a grind for all those but the\npriv il f ged few who reach\nthe top by treading on\nothers.\nTo attempt to present\nsuch a deathly dull\nboredom as 'More\ninteresting than I could\nhave imagined' and to\nglamor is e it as 'a good\nlaugh' and lo speak of 'free\ndrinks on the firm' which\nare provided by the theft of\ndecent wages for those\nwho work at the sharper\nend of industry is both\nshabbily dishonest and a blatant shitting on the\nheads of those who do the\nreal work in industry\u2014the\noppressed majority.\nAnd those students who\nhave recently joined, no\ndoubt as a result of a certain fresher s gullibility\nthat is only to be expected,\nshould be aware that they\nare merely tokens in the\nf radula nt power games\ntaking place now in\nuniversities throughout the\ncountry. That their token\nsupport is what will make it\nincreasingly difficult for the\nIndustrial Society to be\nseen as an undesirable\nintruder in an academic\nenvironment is quite plain.\nIronically, any attempt to\nremove them will be hailed\nby them as a suppression\nof freedom, but, at the end\nof the day, Carl Burgess,\nICU President, must have\nthe courage of his\nconvictions and boot the\nwhole travelling circus off\ncampus. And there is no\nneed at all for him to\nexpend effort trying to\njustify his actions fearing\ncrucifixion at Council and\nthe U GM because it is clear\nthai the Industrial Society\nis nothing more than an\nimmense and deviously\nclever PR exercise as\nunwelcome and\nretrospectively obvious as a smear of shit on a toilet\ndoor. But it slinks far worse\nbecause it is underhand\nand has been slipped in\nbefore anyone noticed what\nthey were up to. Its a con-trick because you don't realise and register\nconsciously what such an\ninfluence is doing to you,\nespecially when you're new\nto student life and frankly\nlack the nous to see what' s happening here.\nLet me list what's wrong\nwith it and why it has to go.\nIt is a restricting of ideas. It\nis a cramping of university\nlife by its continual\nreference to what happens\nat the end of it as if College\nitself were merely a stepping stone \u2014 this is a com tempt i ble idea and\ntends to obscure the value\nof a university education\nand steals from those who\nmay choose other more\naesthetic things in life and\nwho turn their back on\npower struggles and\nseriously believe the planet\nis in danger of being\nreduced to a cold and\nruthless rubble of\ndwindling significance\nprecisely because of such\nshallow attitudes to life in\ngeneral, foisted upon\nimpressionable students\nwho thought they could be\nfree of such influences in\nwhat is supposed to be a society of diverse and\nfascinating people. But\nthey're all the same and\nthey want everyone else to\njoin in and become faceless\nboring, uninspiring\nautomatons in a big\nmachine they think they\ngrasp the consequences of,\nwhereas really they have\nbeen press uri sed by hard-sell and the threat of not\ngetting a job in a cult\nfer v our which demands of\nits devotees an astounding\nand no doubt lucrative\nreverence for the great god\nIndustry. In return they are\npromised a job which they\ncould have got anyway.\nAnd so they miss out on\nuniversity and all it has to\noffer in a blinding\nallegiance to complacency\nand all the canker such an\nattitude shovels out into\nsociety.\nBut much much worse\nthan all of this is the fact\nthat it is a sprawling and\npervading debasement of\none's leisure time to feel\nobliged to look to one's masters in industry at the\nend of three years. And so\n\u2014 called recreation\nobtained through such a 'social' society can never\nbe divorced from the\nreason behind, why you are\nthere ko c king back the\ngratis drinks \u2014 the\npremature ingratiating of\nyourself with those who will\nrule your lives at the end of\nit just because you have let\nthem. It truly is a horrible\nthing to have turned up to\ntinker with your enjoyment\nof life here at Imperial. To\narrive at college to find you\nare already being\nmanipulated by people who\nhave no right to be granted\nsuch influence over you is\na shame-faced incongruity\nand its ef flu via spreads\neverywhere its Thatcherite\nideology. To feel obliged to\nmake ugly decisions about\nwhether membership of\nsuch a society will improve\nyour chances of a job is\nnot what the Union is all\nabout and such a society\nshould not be granted\nUnion status. It is an\ninterloper.\nSuch a discouragement\nof free and critical thought\nby a foisting of early\ncommit t ment and this\nwhole phenomenon of self-seeking student barons of\nindustry with their rapidly\nmaturing obscene\nwallowing greed and slimy\npresumptions in disguise as\nordinary students with\ngenuinely sincere and\nalt unti c interest in the\nsubject of industry is the\nsaddest thing that has ever\ncrawled out of a shit-heap\nand into a student\nenvironment.\nSteve Marshall\n\n"

    "content": "News\nCollege pays up on\nLinstead sale\nThe College is to make \u00a35-7000\nworth of 'ex-gratia payments' to\nstudents who lost possessions in last\nyear's Linstead Hall basement sale.\nThe offers have come after insurance\ncompanies refused to settle claims\nover the sale. The payments will be\nmet by the College's central\naccount.\nThe offers have arrived a year\nafter the Linstead Hall basement\nsale, in which students' possessions\nstored in the basement of Linstead\nHall were sold. The sale was held\non December 5 last year, after\nnotices were placed in FELIX telling\nstudents to remove any items stored\nin the basement. College officials at\nthe time claimed that the items sold\nhad been left in the basement for\nsome time and were unlabeled.\nCollege Senior Assistant Finance\nOfficer, Malcolm Aldridge told\nFELIX that the College would be\nmaking offers 'without prejudice' to\nthe students concerned. The offers,\nhe said, would be 'between a half\nand a two thirds' of what the\nclaimants originally sought.\nCollege Secretary, John Smith\nsaid that if students accept the\nclaims they will absolve the College\nof 'any supposed liability.' He\nadded that, as 'offers without\nprejudice' their offers would not\naffect any court case, should\ndissatisfied students wish to sue the\nCollege. 'We as a College do not\nadmit liability,' he said.\nMr Smith went on to say that the\nCollege had 'learnt its lessons'.\nThere are now rules for storage of\nbelongings in Linstead Hall\nbasement. Students are limited to a storage period of 13 weeks, with a maximum of \u00a3500 worth of\nequipment per student. Items must\nnow be clearly labeled with their\nowners name, address, department\nand a date of deposit.\nMr Aldridge condemned the\nPro'.'in cia l insurance company for its\nlate reply to the claims. The\ncompany, which is responsible for\nthe College's Halls of Residence\ninsurance, did not reply to claims\nmade in January this year until\nOctober. Mr Aldridge said he felt it\nwas 'particularly bad' that\nindividual claimants had not been\ncontacted. He added that the policy\nis due for renewal next August,\nwhen he will look at it more\ncarefully than most of those due for\nrenewal.\nThe claims range from \u00a32500\nworth of ski equipment to small\nclaims of \u00a370 or so. Mr Aldridge has\nspoken to the claimants of the four\nlargest losses from the seven he has\nofficially received. He told FELIX\nthat he hopes to contact all of the\nclaimants in writing before the end\nof this term.\nPNL\npicket\nFive students at the Polytechnic of\nNorth London (PNL) were\nsuspended on Tuesday 6 December.\nThe suspensions were made after a disciplinary hearing for six students\nwho protested against MP, Mr\nNorman Tebbit's visit to PNL.\nMr Tebbit visited the Polytechnic\nin November to speak to its\nConservative Society. A PNL\nspokesman told FELIX that Mr\nTebbit was shouted down by\nstudents during his speech. After\nthe meeting a group of students\nrushed past security guards and\n'attempted to jostle Mr Tebbit'. The\nstudents were apprehended and\nsuspended from the College,\npending their hearing on December\n6.\nA small picket was held by\nstudents outside the hearing and\nPNL's Governing Body meeting to\nprotest against the suspensions.\nMerry Christmas Mister Botha\nStrong feelings for and against\napartheid were brought to the boil\nlast Thursday when Debsoc invited\nMr Jan Castelyn from the South\nAfrican Embassy to speak on behalf\nof the South African government.\nMr Castelyn, who last week\naddressed an audience of 800\nstudents in Bristol University,\ngained an audience of less than 40\nat IC. The low attendance was partly\nattributable to a handout by Imperial\nCollege Anti-Apartheid Group\nurging students not to attend the\nlecture. 'Listening to Mr Castelyn's speech', they claimed, 'is clearly in\ncontradiction with our belief.\nMr Castelyn deli -red a thirty\nminute speech on the South African\ngovernment skirting the issue of\napartheid.\nDr Kevin O 'Connor of the\nDepartment of Computing, who has\nlived in South Africa for 25 years\nwas unimpressed by Mr Castelyn's claims that his audience had only\nheard 'one side of the story'. He\ndescribed the claim as\n'inappropriate, presumptuous,\npatronising and a waste of time'. He\nalso said that Mr Castelyn's speech\nlacked substance on the whole, that\nit did not address the issues and that\nhe seemed to be 'out of touch with\nthe aspirations of the people.'\nMr Castelyn's defence centred\naround two themes. He firstly\nclaimed that sanctions were, and\nwould be, of negative help. As\ncompanies pull out of South Africa,\nhe said, they lose their influence,\nand their South African employees\nlose their jobs. 'Lost jobs don't help\npeople,' he added. He secondly\ninsisted that the problems in South\nAfrica had been exaggerated by the\npress, which highlighted only the\nbad incidents, he said 'you can find\nbombs, street violence and the\nkilling of innocent people here in\nLondon'.\nHe did not address the\nfundamental issues of state\ninstigated violence, human rights\nand one-man-one-vote. He\nfrequently insisted that the\ngovernment was prepared to talk to\nblack leaders, many of whom are\nimprisoned or in exile. .\u201e\nPage 8 FELIX December 14 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nChristmas tree appeared in Britain.\nIt was introduced by Queen\nVictoria's husband, the Germanborn Prince Albert. Its popularity\nincreased from then on as it became\na part of the celebration of\nChristmas. Decorations were also\nadded to the tree. Each with its own\nstory.\nDecorating the Tree\nThe Star\nThe practice of decorating the\nChristmas Tree with a star is a reminder of the star which led the\nthree wise men to the birth place of\nJesus. Sometimes a doll is placed at\nthe top of the tree. Originally this\nwas supposed to represent the baby\nJesus or the Angel Gabriel, but\nnowadays the doll often is dressed\nas a fairy or a princess!\nTinsel\nA legend is told to explain the\norigins of tinsel: Once there was a poor woman, working hard to\nprovide for her family. One night\nsome spiders spun their web on the\nfamily's Christmas Tree and in\nacknowledgement of the woman's goodness, the Christ child turned\nthe webs to silver.\nChristmas Cards\nThe first Christmas Card was made\nin 1843 by Sir Henry Cole, founder\nof the Victoria and Albert Museum,\nLondon. The card was sent to Mr.\nJohn Horsley and was titled\n'Brimming Cheer'. It pictured a family celebrating Christmas and\ngiving gifts of clothing and food to\nthe poor. It is on display in the\nVictoria and Albert Museum.\nChristmas Plays\nIn times before most people could\nread, Bible stories were presented to\nthe een era l public in the form of\nplays. Christmas plays, or Nativity\nplays as they are often called, which\ndepict the story of the birth of\nChrist, are often performed in\nschools at Christmas, and continue\nthis tradition.\nThe Christmas Gift Of Peace\nOn Christmas Eve 1914 it was cold\nand frosty on the battle field.\nGerman and British forces, in the\nmidst of World War I, stood facing\neach other, separated by a strip of\nno-man's land intersected with\nbarbed wire.\nSuddenly, amazed British soldiers\nsaw lights come on along the line of\nenemy trenches. Then came the\nunbelievable sound of singing -German soldiers singing 'Silent\nNight, Holy Night'. When the\nsound died away the British soldiers\nreplied with 'The First Noel'.\nThe singing by both sides went on\nfor an hour and was followed b v invitations to cross over to enemy\nlines. One German with great\ncourage began to walk across to the\nBritish trenches, followed by other\nGermans, hands in pockets, to\nshow that they had no weapons.\nMen who had spent weeks trying to\nkill each other now embraced, sang\nand exchanged souvenirs and\nchocolate. Even a football match was\norganized...\nWhen Christmas Day dawned\nbright and cold, there was no sound\nof rifles or gunfire. The men had\nagreed among themselves to cease\nfire. And for that one brief day peace\nreigned on the battle front.\nIt has been almost 2,000 years\nsince the angels declared the Good\nNews of Jesus' birth to the\nshepherds. 'Glory to God in the\nhighest, and on Earth peace, good\nwill toward men'. Sadly, much of\nour world still knows very little of\nthat peace.\nThe story of Christmas\nIn those days Caesar Augustus\nissued a decree that a census should\nbe taken of the entire Roman world.\n(This was the first census that took\nplace while Quirinius was governor\nof Syria.) And everyone went to his\nown town to register.\nSo Joseph also went up from the\ntown of Nazareth in Galilee to\nJudea, to Bethlehem the town of\nDavid, because he belonged to the\nhouse and line of David. He went\nthere to register with Mary, who\nwas pledged to be married to him\nand was expecting a child. While\nthey were there, the time came for\nthe baby to be born, and she gave\nbirth to her firstborn, a son. She\nwrapped him in cloths and placed\nhim in a manger, because there was\nno room for them in the inn.\nAnd there were shepherds living\nout in the fields nearby, keeping\nwatch over their flocks at night. An\nangel of the Lord appeared to them,\nand the glory of the Lord shone\naround them, and they were\nterrified. But the angel said to them,\n\"Do not be afraid. I bring you good\nnews of great joy that will be for all\nthe people. Today in the town of\nDavid a Saviour has been born to\nyou; he is Christ the Lord. This will\nbe a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in\na manger.\"\nSuddenly a great company of the\nheavenly host appeared with the\nangel, praising God and saying,\n\"Glory to God in the highest, and\non earth peace to men on whom his\nfavour rests.\"\nWhen the angels had left them\nand gone into heaven, the\nshepherds said to one another,\n\"Let's go to Bethlehem and see this\nthing that has happened, which the\nLord has told us about.\"\nSo they hurried off and found\nMary and Joseph, and the baby,\nwho was lying in the manger. When\nthey had seen him, they spread the\nword concerning what had been\ntold them about this child, and all\nwho heard it were amazed at what:\nthe shepherds said to them. But\nMary treasured up all these things\nand pondered them in her heart.\nThe shepherds returned, glorifying\nand praising God for all the things\nthey had heard and seen, which\nwere just as they had been told.\n|(Luke.2.1-20)\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 25\n\n"

    "content": "News\nGospel is\noriginal\nEnoch Powell delivered a lecture to\nthe HG Wells Society last week on\nthe topic of 'Textual Criticism'\nbasing his case on the sequence of\nauthorship s of the New Testament.\nMr Powell, who is a former\nProfessor of classics, defined textual\ncriticism as 'the science of art of\nrestoring the authors' true intention\nwhen it has been lost'. He has\nexamined second century AD Greek\ndocuments for contradictions\nbetween text and context, and has\nfound the first Gospel of Matthew\nto be the original.\nIntercollegiate perks go\nMascotry\nCity & Guilds Union's mascots,\nSpanner and Bolt were returned to\nthem last Tuesday by the Royal\nCollege of Science Union (RCSU).\nCity and Guilds raised \u00a31,100 for\nGreat Ormond Street Hospital's Wishing Well Appeal, in the ransom\nof their mascots.\nRCSU VP, Dave Williams said\nafterwards, 'Same again next year\nboys'.\nSee feature on page 31.\nComputer\nthefts\nAn IBM computer, worth \u00a33,500,\nwas stolen from the Chemical\nEngineering building on Monday.\nOn the subject of police\ninvestigations into computer thefts\nwithin IC, Head of Security Geoff\nReeves said, T have to confess we\nhaven't got a great deal'.\nAstroturf\nIC Union will spend \u00a3350,000 on an\n'Astroturf' pitch at Harlington the\nCollege sports ground.\nThe pitch will be used for hockey\npredominantly, but will have\nfacilities for football use. It will be\nused for tennis during the summer\nmonths, said ICU President Nigel\nBaker.\nThe tenders for the work have to\nbe presented by the end of term and\nthe work will be finished by October\n1989.\nI.C. students who spend their first\nyear in Inter-Collegiate Halls will no\nlonger be guaranteed a year's residence in I. C.ac como dati on. The\nmove comes as a result of the\nincreased pressure on the\nAccommodation Office as the\nunder-graduate fresher and postgraduate overseas intake increases.\nIC students were previously\nencouraged to apply to\nintercollegiate Halls since the\nnumber of applicants accepted was\nset as a proportion of those\napplying.\nImperial College now has a guaranteed number of places\navailable to it in intercollegiate halls\nafter changes to intake procedures.\nIn future students applying for\nfirst-year accommodation in College\nwill be asked to choose between IC\nand intercollegiate accommodation.\nThe Students Residence Committee\n(SRC) hopes that an increased\nnumber of fresher s will be housed\nin Inter-Collegiate Halls, thus\nproviding IC with more space to\nhouse its overseas postgraduate\nfirst-year students.\nAt present all fresher s, except\nthose living in the Greater London\npostal districts, are guaranteed a place in residence. This year,\nhowever, the guarantee required all\nbut 20 of the 1,700 places available\nin IC residence. Although 160 of the\nplaces were subsequently released\nfor re-allocation, Dr Levitt of the\nSRC described the statistics as 'too\nclose for comfort'. He believes the\nnew system will increase the\nCollege's capacity to house fresher s, re-apps and overseas postgraduate\nstudents. He hopes that fresher s presently in inter-collegiate\naccommodation will be unaffected\nby the change and that the\nAccommodation Office will be able\nto honour its original claims and\nhouse those who wish to spend a subsequent year in I.C. accommodation.\nUnion President Nigel Baker\nexpressed doubts about the\nproposals. T can't see people opting\nto go and live five miles away when\nthey could be in College', he said.\nCouncil sketch\nAnyone listening to 1C radio's news\nbulletin would be forgiven for\nthinking that the Union had agreed\nto purchase a fish tank for the Union\nOffice. They were close; at Monday\nnight's Council (the decision\nmaking body of the Union) a motion\ncalling for a 'think tank' of ex-students to be set up was approved.\nThe business moved swiftly on to\na motion designed to prevent\nsocieties such as Industrial Society\nspending externally generated\nincome on dinners for its members.\nThe motion was put forward by Mr\nBaker in a remarkable U turn after\ninitially approving the idea of a dinner for the society. Under the\nterms of the motion, externally\ngenerated income used for\n'gratuities' should first be approved\nby Union Finance Committee\n(UFC). The motion was passed\ndespite protestations from the\nFELIX Editor who claimed that it\nwould make utilising the FELIX\nStaff Fund, recently approved by\nPublications Board very difficult.\nGavin Spittlehouse presented his\nreport on this years Careers Fair,\n(Mr Spittlehouse represents the\nUnion as both the Chairperson of\nthe Industrial Relations Subcommittee and the treasurer of\nIndustrial Society). He calculated\nthat the Fair had generated \u00a310,000\nprofit, but the bone of contention\nwas should Ind Soc receive payment\nfor the Fair?\nCouncil finally degenerated when\nan irate FELIX Editor, Bill Goodwin\nasked the executive to explain the\nsetting up of a committee to look\ninto the standard of FELIX. Mr\nGoodwin asked the Exec to explain\nwhy he had not been informed\nabout the committee, the reasons for\nit being set up, and why he had not\nbeen invited to attend the meeting.\nUnion President Nigel Baker\nresponded that the Exec wished to\nmeet before approaching the Editor\nso that they could first discuss the\nperceived problems amongst\nthemselves. City and Guilds\npresident Ralph Greenwell said that\nthe committee had been set up\nbecause of complaints that the\nGuilds cocktail cards printed by the\nPrint Unit had to be reprinted when\nthey were discovered to be covered\nwith inky fingerprints, and because\nGuilds were unhappy about paying\nfor advertisments in FELIX.\nMr Goodwin retorted that if there\nhad been any complaints then he\nshould have been informed and\npointed out that other clubs and\nCCU's pay for their advertisments.\nCompetition\nHoneywell has launched its fifth\nannual Futurist Competition for\nstudents, offering three prizes of.\n\u00a3700 to entrants submitting the best\n2000 word essays. The competition\ninvites students to speculate on the\ntechnological developments of the\nnext 25 years in the fields of\naer c pace, energy, manufacturing,\nautomation and technology in the\nhome or work environment.\nThe UK winners will attend a banquet in Madrid with winners\nfrom similar competitions from\nEuropean countries to compete for\nfour one year scholarships at a US\nuniversity.\nFor further details contact Mike\nKean on 0344 416379.\nWine\nwhipped\nOver \u00a3150 worth of wine and spirits\nwas stolen from IC Wine Tasting\nSociety's locker in the Union\nBuilding over the weekend. The 30\nbottles of wine , brandy and port\nand two cases of beer were stolen\nafter thieves forced the locker open.\nThe theft came after WineSoc's 'duty-free' trip to France. The drink\nstolen belonged to the club and\nmembers. WineSoc Chairman,\nEmma Simpson said, 'whoever did\nit either knew we'd gone (to France)\nor was just bloody lucky.'\nICU Deputy President said he\n'very much doubted' the incident\nwould be insured against.\nWinner\nG Copland of Mineral Resources\nEngineering wins the one gallon\nbottle of whisky in the FELIX\n'Alcohol Awareness Week\nCompetition', correctly answering\nthe four difficult questions.\nCome and collect the prize from\nthe FELIX Office. FELIX\nrecommends not to drink it all at\nonce!\nAnd finally...\n(FELIX would like to thank Nick\nWright for producing the Christmas\ncover. Nick worked solidly from\n8pm until 2am to produce an\nexcellent design for which we are\nextremely grateful.\nDecember 14 1988 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
