The issue of\naffiliation to N.U.S: is again being\nraised because of the changing\nstatus of I.C., and the fact that\nunder half the present students\nwere here when the issue was\nlast raised two years ago.\nMany students argue that I.C. can voice its opinion nationally\nwithout joining N.U.S. But what\nhope have 3,000 students in comparison with the 250,000 members\nof N.U.S. N.U.S. is in fact regarded as National Student\nopinion, Government Committees\ntake notice of it, and also it has\na voice in Parliament through\nM.P.s drawn from all parties.\nFor example, through pressure,\nit achieved the reversal of a Ministry of Pensions decision to\ncharge P.G. students the heavy\nself-employed (Class 2) N.I. rate,\nand has gained the concession of\nallowing students 6 years in which\nto pay back N.I. contributions. It\nis at present campaigning for\ncontributions to be credited to\nstudents throughout their studies.\nWe will not, however, be\nswamped, in the vast membership\nof N.U. S.I.C. will be able to\ncontinue in its present manner,\nbut will also have a voice at the\nbi-annual N.U.S. council, where\nthe executive is elected, motions\non many topics concerning students and education are debated,\nand action is decided upon.\nAdvantages\nThere are many activities in\nwhich affiliated colleges may take\npart, including the \" Observer\nMace \" debating competition, the\nN.U.S. Drama Festival and the\nStudent Newspaper Competition.\nThere are also many concessions\navailable to individuals such as\ncheap travel, charter flights, vacation employment (non-vocational)\nscheme, and discounts in various\nshops. Admittedly, these concessions may be obtained by individual members of N.U.S.( who\npay 15/- subscriptions) but these\nmembers have no voice in the\ncouncil of N.U.S. At the present rate of Is. 3d. per member the cost of joining\nfor all I.C. would be about \u00a3200\np.a. plus about \u00a3100 to send delegate to council, which is less than\nis already paid by individual\nmembers of I.C. to N.U.S. This\nfee will rise to 2s.6d. in 1967/8.\nThis amount is very small in the\nlight of the c. \u00a316,000 annual budget of I.C.U. Will our money be wasted by\nN.U.S? Consider the benefits and\nwork done by N.U.S., and also\nthe fact that of the \u00a3500,000 annual budget of N.U.S., only\n\u00a316,000 comes from student sub-script ions. The issue will be further dis-cussed, and more information\nwill be forthcoming in Felix and\nat an N.U.S. Forum.\nPENELOPE WILLIAMS\nMIKE EDWARDS\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX11^ fA VB it### Dear Sir,\nI understand that the column \" Foreign Affairs \" is written by\nChris Lampard of Aero 1. Surely he is supposed to give a brief\nsurvey of events in other colleges, not his personal opinions. In the\nlast edition he used the fact that only six students turned up from\nKings to an Anti-Apartheid rally as an excuse for a long harangue,\nfull of sarcasms, such as {zealous an ties and pink student-politicians.\" Let's get a few things straight, Mr. Lampard. You don't have to\nbe a communist, or even a fellow-traveller, to be revolted by the\nbrutality which exists in S. Africa to-day. The country is a police\nstate, geared to the suppression of the black population. The blacks\nare unable to hold political meetings, belong to Trade Unions, vote\nin a General Election, hold any position of responsibility or power, or\n\u2022even move about the country without police permission. Peaceful\ndemonstrations are impossible\u2014remember the Sharpeville massacre?\nThose people were unarmed ; they were shot in the back running away\nfrom armour d cars. (The armoured cars were sold to the S. African\nGovernment by Britain. Does that mean nothing to you ?) Mr.\nLampard asks \" is everyone really in sympathy with a terrorist movement ?\" I suggest that, regrettably, no other course of action is open\nto the blacks.\nAs for \" meddling in the internal affairs of another country \";\nnobody lives in splendid isolation\nthese days. What happens in S. Africa concerns us, here and now,\nthe more because we do an ever\nincreasing amount of trade with\nS. Africa, including a song which\ngoes \" If you make money from\nVerwoed, how can you tell him\nthat he's wrong ?' It's easy isn't it, Mr. Lampard, you just keep\nyour eyes shut tight.\nFinally, I must level some adverse criticism at the editors,\nMessrs. Walker and Williams, for\nallowing this to be printed, for,\npurely by accident, I saw the copy\nbefore going to press, and voiced\nmy opinions. I'm afraid that, if\nFelix is prepared to print articles\nsuch as this, then I am not prepared to give my services to Felix\nany longer\u2014you may consider\nme resigned.\nB.J. BULL( Felix ex-cartoonist).\nANTI\u2014APARTHEID\nIn your last issue you printed something purporting to be a news\nitem under \" Foreign Affairs \" entitled \" Anti-Apartfieid Apathy \"\nconcerning the attitude of students of Kings College. However, it\nmainly contained a series of naive opinions.\nThe And-Apartheid rally was to protest against the discrimination\nwhich exists under an oppressive regime, and not to condone acts of\nterrorism. It is one of the tragedies of the South African situation\nthat there can Tie no democratic opposition, and. opposition to the\nregime can now only take the form of revolutionary and terrorist\nactivity. It is because we for sec the repetition of an Algerian, situation\nthat we oppose Apartheid.\nThe writer accuses us of \" meddling in the internal affairs of\nanother country.\" This opinion is superficial. Surely the writer must\nrealise that the present course of events in South Africa will lead to a collision, which could easily be a war extending over the whole African continent, if not the world. For South Africa has most of the\nmajor problems of the world m microcosms, and to be apathetic\nabout Apartheid is to be apathetic about many things.\nYours sincerely,\nBARRY UTTING (Chairman),\nROY CLARKE( Secretary),\nROGER A.

Do Well\nAgainst Formidable Opposition\nThe training camp was due to\nstart at Miskin near Cardiff on\n28th December, but had to be\ndelayed by twenty four hours due\nto the snow which had cut off\nmuch of South Wales. However,\nthe thaw was quick and training\nwas not badly affected.\nThe finals was the Nos Galan\nat Mountain Ash on New Year's Eve. I.C. had already seen the\ncourses for the five races, of\nwhich club members had entered\ntwo\u2014the one and the four miles.\nMountain Ash is a small mining\ntown in a deep valley, and the\ncourses all include an uncomfortable number of very steep\nhills. Still, at least the snow was\nalmost clear, and hills were not as\ndangerous in descent as they\nmight have been.\n4 p.m. saw the start of the mile\nrace, I.C. had little hope of success as there were five internationals in the field of thirty!\nH. Dickson caused quite a stir by\nleading the first break after half\na mile. Inevitably he faded but\nfinished only twenty seconds behind two four minute milers\n(Simpson and Whetton) in 15th place. A. Bishop was a tired\n17th after a severe cold and P. Blake 25th. Olympic Send-off\nDuring the evening other races\nwere held and then near midnight\nthe climax mounted. A torch-bearer ran down the mountainside pre cee ded by a car with\npolice siren, and eventually ran\ndown the packed mam street with\na further escort of more torch\nbearers. As he reached the start\nof the four mile race, a Verey\nrocket was ignited followed by\nover two hundred runners to the\necstatic cheers of spectators, who\nlined every yard of the route with\nflaming torches\u2014an atmosphere\nunrepeatable anywhere else.\nThose who had earlier raced in\nthe mile soon found the bills very\nhard going, but A. Cope had a very good race, just winning a Nos Galan vest (awarded to the\nfirst fifty) and was backed up well\nby D. May and D. Reaves. The\nrace was won by A.

GRUNDY\nI.C.34 Reading University.\nStruggling near the bottom of\nthe Premier League, I.C. disappointingly returned from Harlington on Saturday, January \\6th, without the mud h needed win to\nboost their dwindling confidence.\nWith Grundy back in the team\nat centre-half, the home side had\nbeen slightly rearranged, Morland\nmoving up to centre-forward to\ndemonstrate his much boasted\ntalents. This excellent move soon\npaid off when Morland clinched a half-chance with a shot from close\nrange. At this stage the I.C. wing-halves easily contained a dormant Reading attack, and kept\nthe home forwards well supplied.\nLuxton and Crisp were both in\nelusive form and the latter made\nuse of his exceptional control in\nthe muddy conditions to formulate the second I.C. goal. Moving\nthrough the Reading defence on\nthe left he crossed the ball for\nBatcup to score with one of those\n\"out-of-the-hat\" t went v five yard\ndrives. Soon afterwards, Luxton\nput the ball into the net but was\nadjudged to have used his hands.\nReading now came more into\nthe game and scored when the\ncentre-forward was left un-marked, and a minute later a long\nshot from the Reading inside-right completely beat the I.C. defence and evened the scores.\nIn the thirty-fifth minute, I.C. were awarded a free kick from\nwhich Johnson, aided by the wind,\nscored with a high, dipping lob.\nHowever, the I.C. defence, playing the double centre-half system\nrepeatedly show ea lack of co he sion. This was demonstrated\nwhen the Reading centre-forward\nCUP DEFEAT\nThe I.C defence failed to keep out Kings in their second round\nCup tie; Kings won 6-2.\nBy TY E \"God help Cardiff\" was Arthur\nLoveday's comment when he\nheard of the proposed f fagin s' trip\nto the Welsh capital for the\nEngland v. Wales Rugby International. The party, some 20\nstrong, clutching sleeping bags\nand cans of beer, left Paddington\nat 6 p.m. on Friday, 15th January. Emerging from the piles of\nempty cans at Cardiff station they\nwere met by some of the Cardiff\nUniversity Biochemists who they\nwere to play the next morning.\nThe opposition set out to drown\nany potential playing ability in\nthe f fagin s' team; little resist en ce to this gesture was forthcoming\nfrom f fagin s. After stop-tap and\na curry, accommodation was\nsought and eventually found. The\nnumber of residents of University\nHall increased substantially that\nnight.\nSaturday morning dawned wet\nand windy. Late, as usual, fifteen\nplayers turned out to play in vile\nConditions\u2014heavy rain and high\nwinds. The game was very even,\nbut the I.C. backs could not\nhandle the ball cleanly.

A Reading full-back was\nthen taken off with a torn ligament thus reducing both sides to\nvirtually ten men.\nFurther stoppages resulted in a deterioration of the game, but\nReading took t ne lead trom a penalty when their left-winger\nwas fouled in the area.

A great deal of financial support will be required and\nwe expect that it will be some\nyears before the union is achieved,\nthough this is a particularly busy\ntime for those working out the\narrangements.\nIn our own undergraduate\ncourses there are unlikely to be\nmajor changes-in the pattern, type\nand length. Students will be accepted to read for honours degrees in primary disciplines and\nstudy in more specialised fields\nwill continue to be deferred to the\npostgraduates age. I hope that\nit will be easier for undergraduates to transfer from one department to another and that there\nwill be greater freedom of choice\nand variety in the courses for\nancillary subjects. These might\nextend to subjects outside Science\nand Technology and to those\ngiven in- other departments.\nPOSTGRADUATE\nDEVELOPMENTS\nAt the postgraduate stage one\nyear courses of study will constantly develop and change. This\nis a dynamic part of our work\nwhit ii responds very quickly to\nmeet the needs of industry and\ngovernment. A recent example\nis the course on Transport, started\nless than a year after the publication of the Buchanan Report.\nMany of the most active scientific\nand technological fields at the\nmoment border on different disciplines. Several of our courses are\ndesigned for these workers and\nfurther cooperation between de departments \u2014and not limited to\nsuch courses\u2014may be expected.\nWe shall be taking a look at three\nparticular areas\u2014earth sciences,\nlife sciences and natural resources.\nIt is a fairly safe prediction that\nour computing facilities, soon to\nbe operational, will increase the\ntempo in many fields. Even in\nthe next decade fresh growing\npoints, at present unforeseen, may\nspring up at the College, but\nsome space has prudently been\nreserved for them in our long-term plan.\nRESIDENTIAL AND SOCIAL\nLIFE\nMost of the additional residential and social provision will be\nprovided through the full development of the sif\nes in Prince's Gardens. The next two projects\nwill, we hope, be the Sports\nCentre on the north-west corner,\nand New Hall in the south-east\none. The refectories and common rooms in College Block will\nprovide another main centre for\nsocial life, and conveniently near\nthe libraries.\nIn writing of the future the\nmost important point can sometimes be overlooked; that the\nCollege only comes to life\nthrough its members\u2014its staff\nand students. To them much is\nbeing given and from them much\nwill be expected. The years\nahead are full of promise and op-port unity.

Bean,\nBarry Pichler\nAndrew Mayo,\nJocetyn Mackintosh\nJohn Cawson\nPUBLIC IMAGES\nAfter the un he ava Js of the new Union Officials settling down last\nterm, a few. new ideas are beginning to develop from the embryo\nstage. By far the most important of these is the proposed European\nConference for Technical Students in Manchester during the Summer\nvacation. This is one of the very few outward looking ventures\nin which I.C. has ever participated, and the pub ili city we shall receive\nshould do any amount of good in improving our public image.\nFar too many people in the past have regarded students as irresponsible lay about s; it does appear, however, that this attitude is\nslowly changing. On the B.BC. programme \" Any Questions \" last\nDecember \"John Fireeman, in particular, thought that students are\nresponsible beings. The Kensington Post praises I.C. in its selection\nof the Notting Hill Housing Trust as this year's charity (see below).\nTo live up to this slowly improving image, we must beware of\nletting our spirits carry us away, if and when participating in rags\nof any sort. Morphy Day this year and the Festival Hall Carnival\nRaid two years ago were successful\u2014for little inconvenience was\nincurred. But Morphy Day 1962 went to the other extreme. Zebra\ncrossing snakes are fun, but when traffic is held up along the whole\nof Cromwell Road, no wonder the public are dubious. (If the\nrumour now circulating of placing a zebra crossing outside Mech.\nEng. comes off, wc can be sure it won't stay long if it's misused\nevery other day.)\nThe Carnival Commandoes always come into a good deal of\ncriticism for rowdyism\u2014they do a good job\u2014they collected over\n\u00a31,200 last year in the West End.\nTO THE COUNTRY\nSilwood Park\u2014to most people the, name conjures up a place\nwhere zoologists and some botanists disappear in their third year.\nIt is also the venue for Touchstone Weekends. These weekends are\nexcellent value. They take the form of a prominent person making\na short speech introducing'a topical subject, which is followed by\ndiscussions. Both staff and students are welcome, the charge being\nonly 15/-. This terms weekend is on. February 6th7 th, when Sir\n\"Michael Wright, G.C.M.G., a prominent British spokesman on Disarmament, will introduce the topic \" Is far-reaching disarmament\nUtopian ?\"\nTouchstone is one of the few ways we have to improve our\nknowledge on specific matters of general and topical interest. I sincerely hope that this term's Weekend will not be cancelled for lack\nof support!; as happened the last Touchstone Weekend.\nBut for Kensington's two principal housing trusts, the Ken- .\ns lng ton and Notting HiH societies, we shudder to think how |\nmany families would be facing a cheer Jess Christmas this year.\nBoth have had an exceptionally busy and fruitful year; the\nNotting HiH Trust alone has raised well over \u00a350,000 in Its\nfirst year.\nThis trust was recently adopted by, students! of the Imperial(\nCollege of Science and Technology as its \"beneficiary\"\u2014and\ntih js is typical of the help the society is getting from students\ngenerally. In addition to collecting money for the Trust students\nnave been hard at work on one of the Trust's houses im\nNorth Kensington. They have been scrubbing floors, scraping\noff the old wallpaper and generally preparing the place for the\nbuilders who w* II complete the conversion of the hou ee.( Which goes to illustrate how stupid arid .unfair it is to j condemn students as a whole as selfish amd irresponsible.)\nextract from editorial of the Kensington Post 25th December 1964\no THE VISITATION\nEvery five years the University Grants Committee visits the college, and meet representatives\nof the students, among others, for a discussion on\nany problems or ideas they have. It is extremely\nregrettable that although the visit this March was\nknown about well before the end of las f term, no\neffort was made by the President to ask reps to\nprepare memoranda of the opinions of their years\nuntil last week. This gave most of them four or\nfive days to do the job, hardly enough time for\ndocuments to be prepared. Incidentally, rumour\nhas it that plans for the Sports Centre in Princes\nGardens arose as a direct result of the last quin-que n ni al visitation\u2014is it too much to hope that\nthe place will actually be built after this next one ?\nI.C. EXPANSION\nMy picture is a copy of a post card available\nfrom the Domestic Bursar's office, and entitled\nsimply \"Aerial View of Imperial College of\nScience and Technology.\" Surely, Mr. Seaford,\nwe don't own the whole of the G.P.O., three\nmuseums and several embassies, not to mention\nthe Albert Hall. I still can't get into the latter by\nshowing my Union card, anyway !\ncuT THE BIRD\nI'm still not quite sure whether the hour I took to read \" Phoenix \" last night was well s pj nt or not. Certainly \" Sussex Rides \" was one of the\nmost entertaining short stories I have read lately ;\ncertainly the centre page mythological zoo was well\ndrawn, if a little out of place; and certainly my\nintellect couldn't raise or lower itself sufficiently to\nappreciate Mr. Lindsay's and Miss Youle's writ-in gs, although I understand that one about the\nabacus\u2014I think; certainly most of the articles,\nespecially Brian Bull's, were worth reading. I suppose this all adds up to a qualified success.\nHowever, I still remain unrepentant in the belief\nthat the content does not justify the high class/cost\nprinting techniques used. Above all, the magazine\nis too impersonal and \" well written\" to really\nappeal with a character of its own. I also wonder\nif all that blank space'is \" artistic \" or just due to\nlack of copy.

IL NEAR IV RUM BY$6000\nAPARTHEID-NO\nOn Thursday, Professor Charles Manning, Professor Emeritus\nof International Relations at the London School of Economics proposed the motion, \"The Apartheid is the only solution for South\nAfrica to-day.\" He was opposed by Colin Legum, Commonwealth\nCorrespondent of The Observer. The motion was defeated by 24\nvotes to 71 votes with 29 abstentions.\nProfessor Manning began by saying that the Proposition was\nnot going to debate the moral issues of Apartheid. He felt sure that\neveryone, not least himself, deprecated the use of violence in the\nfur the rence of any chosen policy. \" The \u00abas e for the proposition,\"\nhe said, \" is that Apartheid is the only treatment for South Africa\nto-day. We, cannot be sure whether this will turn out to be the complete solution, but at this time it is the only possibility which will\nlead to a solution.\" Professor Manning ended with a challenge to the\nOpposition to give any alternative to Apartheid.\nMr. Legum, a born South African who was active in politics and\njournalism there until he left in 1948, began by regretting that the\nProposition had not dwelt more on the moral issues surrounding\nApartheid. He felt that these were the roots of most people's objection to Apartheid. He did not feel anyone should accept the situation where separation existed as in South Africa.\nMr. Cloete, of the Nuclear Technology Department, carried out\nProfessor Manning's arguments again challenging the Opposition for\nan alternative policy. Roy Clarke, Secretary of the newly formed\nIC. Society for Racial Equality, spoke very fluently but apparently\non another motion. His vivid description of South Africa was good\nbut like Mr. Legum he did not offer any alternative policies.\nex-MP fights Race\nLord Brockway s logical and reasoned appeal for racial equality\nwill, I am sure, have finally converted any wavering segregationists\nwho heard him talking in the Physics Building on Thursday dinner\ntime. The IC Society for Racial Equality was fortunate in obtaining\na speaker who not only felt profoundly about racial problems, but\nwas able to argue with a simple eloquence and practical straight-forwardness, and Slough, called attention to\nThe formerly Fenner Brock- our dependence on immigrant\nway, and ex J Labour MP for Eton labour to run the transport s ys Com, on page 12.\nRAMSEY\nto speak\nOn February 9th, His Grace\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury is\nto visit the College to speak in\nGeneral Studies.

GS. was selected.\nBut on Sunday night, 24th, Walton collected a letter returned\nby the Glasgow post office, which he identified as the one he had\nsent the previous week.

It consists\nof a short play, into which is interwoven Geometric Dancing,\"\n(a combination of Ballet and\nMorris Dancing.) There will be\na professional producer/choreographer, and a professional\norchestra. Music might have to\nbe specially written.\nThe idea is that the play be\npart of The London Festival, with\nsix performances around July\n15th. Although this is after the\nend of the Summer term, more\nvolunteers are welcome; at least\n25 people are required, and it\nwill^probably be a. more attractive\nproposition to P.G.' s, since it involves one evening a week at\npresent (Monday), and probably\nmore nearer the performance.\nAll interested should see Dr.\nCameron as soon as possible,\nsince rehearsals have already\nstarted.\nThe play will be expensive to\nproduce (\u00a31,000-\u00a31,500), and it\nis hoped that external backing\nwill be forthcoming. Nowhere has\nyet been found to present it, although The Goldsmiths' Hall has\nbeen rumoured. As part of the\nLondon Festival, it would particularly attract the tourist trade;\ntickets will be expensive and their\nprofits will go to charity.\nEach performance will be followed by a champagne party, and\nit is hoped that the audience will\nwear costumes of the King James\nperiod.

    "content": "8 FELIX\nThe Rector, Sir Patrick Linstead\nwrites on the future of I.C. under the Robins Recommendations\nScience and Technology are of vital importance in the national\nlife to-day. Not only are they important but they are generally\nrecognised to be important Whether we like it or not they have\nbecome \"news,\" and by force of circumstances the College is now\nbeing pushed more and more into the limelight. Its staff and old\nstudents are taking an ever-growing part in public affairs. Its present\nstudents will have to take similar responsibilities in the future. The\nFinancial Times recently said that in relation to Technology, Imperial\nCollege \" seems to fill the role that All Souls is supposed to play in\npolitics.\"\nThis is a good point from which to take a look at how the\nCollege will probably develop as a result of the Robbins Report. But\nin the present climate in Britain, the other major reports which have\nled to the reorganisation of the structure of civil science are not\nwithout effect on our work, especially with the growing realisation that\nso much depends on the progress which can be made in scientific and\ntechnological fields. It is a challenging time to be helping to guide\nthe College towards its new role and there is little of the traditional\npeace and quiet. A particularly busy and important stage was\nreached about a year ago when plans were laid for the Robbins\nexpansion period.\nThe Consort Nuclear Reactor being assembled at Silwood Park.\nPhoto by kind permission of G.E.C. Ltd.\nTHE ROBBINS REPORT\nTactics to deal with both the\nemergency national shortage of\nplaces for undergraduates and the\nlong-term expansion plan had to\nbe settled quickly. We were not\ncaught exactly unprepared by the\nrecommendations of the Robbins\nReport and the unforeseen speed\nwith which we were asked to submit our plans caused no insuperable difficulty. A committee,\nbriefed to study our long-term\nacademic policy, had already gone\nsome way in its deliberations.\nWhat was practicable in physical\nand academic terms could be assessed realistically against the\nbackground of our previous ten\nyear expansion programme.\nAbove all, the College already\nshowed some of the characteristics of a Special Institution towards which it was asked to chart\nits course\u2014its level of teaching\nand research in Science and Technology, its very high proportion\nof postgraduate students, its very\ngood equipment and technical as-sistance. In framing plans for\nthe future, therefore; we could\ntake into account other characteristics of these Institutions\u2014\ntheir recommended size and diversification into related fields.\nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANS\nTaking the plans for the- emergency period first, further expansion has already started and the\nfi is t group of. undergraduates\nhave begun their courses. Extra\nplaces have been provided in the\nMathematics department, where\n52 and 53 Prince's Gate, have\ngiven elbow-room to start a second undergraduate honours\ncourse biased towards the industrial and statistical applications of\nthe subject. By reorganising the\nuse of the building and splitting\nthe first year into two sections for\nlaboratory work the Physics Department has been able to increase\nits already very large undergraduate entry. Extra Engineering places will be possible on the\ncompletion this summer of the\nlast stage of the Mechanical Engineering building with more accommodation for the common\nfirst year course and with the\nThe Aero and Chem. Eng. Extensions under construction.\nSummer 1964.\nroofing-in of the space on top of\nthe Electrical Engineering build-ing. Nearly all the first wave of\nextra places are being provided in\nthese three main fields. In numbers they are expected to build up\nto perhaps 450 more students per\nannum.\nAccording to the long-term\nplans now with the UGC there\nshould be 4,700 students at the\nCollege in 1973-74. In the intervening years, the emphasis will\nshift from undergraduates to post-graduates- as the emergency of\nbulge\" expansion is gradually\nabsorbed into the main one. Indeed towards 1973-74 the proportion of undergraduates in the\nstudent population will fall. In\nthe ten years which lie ahead it\ndoes not seem practicable to\nachieve the Robbins recommendation that half the students\nshould be postgraduate, but the\nproportion should reach perhaps\n43 per cent. In the total of 4,700\nstudents are included 400 Architects which will be the major diversification into fields outside\nScience and Technology\nREBUILDING PROGRAMME\nMajor physical changes necessary before there is room for\n4,700 students in South Kensington are: the new College Block\n(Administration, Great Hall, libraries and social areas), the demolition and rebuilding of the\nRoyal College of Science Building\n(for Chemistry), and a massive\nsouthern extension of the Physics\nbuilding (mainly for Mathematics\nand Meteorology). It is planned\nthat the students of Architecture\nwill have a building in the vicinity\nand we can look forward to more\nresidential and social developments in Prince's Gardens. At\nSilwood Park, where facilities are\nan essential complement to those\nat South Kensington, the first step\nwill shortly be taken in an expansion of the academic and residential accommodation. This is\nalready inadequate for the growing numbers requiring to use the\nField Station even for short\nperiods only.\nThat is a sketch of where we\nexpect to stand ten years hence\nbut as the years go by the various\ndevelopments will take place in\nfits and starts as buildings become\navailable, equipment is installed,\nstaff appointed etc. Members of\nthe College in the years immediately ahead will find' that there\nare many more undergraduates\naround and that all accommodation\u2014academic, social and residential\u2014will be heavily used since\nbuildings will probably not keep\npace with the rise in numbers.\nTowards the 1970's the physical\nshape of the College will be\nclearer and, we hope, most of the\nbuilding upheavals over. Many of\nthe academic developments now\n\n"

M.( Editor,\nAs early as last November, the\neditor and sub-editor of \"Phoenix\"\napproached your reviewer in the\nBeit Quad and persuaded him to\nwrite a few words on the latest\nissue. He accepted, but not without misgivings. What could one\nhave said about previous\n\" Phoenix \"? One had to be an\n\" arty type \" to appreciate most\nof the content of last year's issues.\nTo the plain, unassuming scientist\nit was so much trash. Surely\nShakespeare turned in his grave!\nThis issue is a considerable im-prove ment. The presentation and\nthe format are of the same high\nstandard that '\"Phoenix\" has\nhas always set. The articles are\nwell written, both in respect of\nthe standard of English and in\ntheir readability. It was pleasing\nto find that in general those\nstories with a veiled meaning\nyielded their secrets with a little\nprodding.\nWhilst one cannot vouch for\nthe factual correctness of the\narticles on the development of the\nCollege, and on higher education\nin Israel, they contain a wealth of\ndetail, evidence of considerable\nhard work on the part of the\nNOT LEY Scrutiny)\nauthors. The pretentiousness in\nstyle and concept of the scientific\nliterature was shown up for what\nit is worth.\nOne wonders to what can be\nattributed this singular improvement in a magazine which until\nrecently was rapidly approaching\nits doom. Can it possibly be\nconnected with the appointment,\nas deputy editor, of a former\neditor of \" Scrutiny \"?\nBy D,I. WILLIAMS\n(Assistant Editor, \" Felix \")\nThe latest issue of \" Phoenix \"\nappears to continue its recent\nchaotic course. The face may\nhave changed, but the spirit remains the same.\nThe cover lacked the striking\nqualities of its two predecessors\n(the bird on the Union door\nwould have been more appropriate and striking). Presentation\nwas spoilt by the complete lack\nof photographs\u2014an opportunity\nwas missed to polish Paul Rogers'\ninformative article (many photographs are available of college\ndevelopment in progress and of\nmodels of the future look).\nPoor presentation also must\nhave deterred non-Israelis from\nreading Carol Thompson's article\non education (and her editorial\nwas a tedious skeleton out of the\ncupboard). But Brian Bull's item\nwas excellent (though I know of\none English folksong collection of\n1882) and should surely further\nhis cause.\nTony White's story too was well\nconceived and executed, and his\ncharacters were convincing (his\nWelshman is my roo:n mate!).\nChris Wright's science-fiction was\nmediocre. Peter Hall must have\nhad a nervous breakdown, and\none hopes that this was the worst\nexample of his literary powers\u2014\nas also Reg. Lindsey.\nThe same may be said for the\npoets\u2014only three lines of Christine Youle's \"Lament\" made any\nsense! and Bruce Gregory should\nstick to his abacus.\nArtwork, however, was generally good, but it was unfortunate\nthat Chris Wright's mythological\nfigures were titled only in the\nContents. But I preferred Brian\nBull's block colour to Mr.\nWright's dots, dashes and Topolski impressions.\nNo amount of quotes filched\nfrom Herodotus, Byron or Shaw,\nitems from past issues, or tongue-in-cheek hints for thesis-writers\ncan compensate for poor original\nworks.\nAs in so many other Union\nactivities the main problem is\napathy, and a small nucleus of\ndiehards are left to struggle\namateurish ly on. Remedies:\nMore contributions, please\n(greater competition is bound\nto improve the magazines quality\nnext copy date February 1); and\n\" Phoenix\" staff, see what the\nnational magazines do, and try to\nemulate their better points (why\nnot start with the Reader's DiRest ?).\n/process of bringing \u201ep*& gT*' Tl*1\n. *\nt/ manner in which a person,hL nSb \u201e' ' t \u00bb>\n' \\0*s.ix c. with notion of 3 be^ o,, \u00ab.\n\u2022 he mati c instruction, s cr \u00bboo)/nS 3 1\n\" ^iV J JJ?*\n7 10 the young (and, by e* ten , \u00b0 r tr J't th^I preparation for the v vor fc Zr%nf*, \u00b0\u00bb.?'ni\nn \u00a3t!> \u2022\ncourse of scholastic / ns tn,c t^4l, \u00a3\nJil i!t{? fU|| TO EDUCATE\nIS TO LEAD\nNever has there been greater need for such leadership,\nor greater opportunities for teachers to take this lead.\nEducation today is full of new life; one of the major\ngrowing points of our society.
