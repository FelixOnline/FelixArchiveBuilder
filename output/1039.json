FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 3RD1995 DIARY\nThe Hellenic\nSociety\nThe Hellenic society is a national society\norganised by Greek IC students, and its\npurpose is to cater for all those interested in\nGreek culture, be it in the shape of music,\nphilosophy, dance, science, food, wine,\nlanguage, literature, or whatever else.\nmonday6 november\nCross Country\nRegular Monday night run. Meet at 5.30 pm\nat bottom of Union staircase.\nConcert Band\n5.15 - 6.45 pm. Great Hall, Sherfield. Any\nability.\nSki Club\n12.30 - 1.15 pm, Southside Upper Lounge.\nRegular meeting.\nStudent Industrial Society\nMeeting 12.00 - 2.00 pm.

Regular meeting.\nArtSoc\n9.30 pm, Union Dining Hall.\nCome and sign up for the many trips to\nmusicals, plays, ballet, opera, etc.\nmonday We also hope to make all these forms of\nGreek Culture more widely known, while at\nthe same time educate ourselves in the\ncultures of other countries. In short, we want\nto make more friends.\nThe highlight of this term's events is the\nfirst 'Greek Evening' of the year which will\ntake place in the Main Dining Hall of the\nSherfield on the 1st of December with Greek\nfood, wine and live music until the early\nhours. Then comes the 'Electroacoustic\nAcroasis', a live music event in the union\nlounge where student bands from IC and\nother universities can come and play. We\nhope to get a wide variety of styles from\ntraditional greek all the way to heavy metal,\nvia jazz and indie.\nWe also invite big names from the\ndomain of science, culture, economics and\npolitics to give lectures.\nApart from social ising, we also feel that\nas a large Society of IC we have the obligation\nto strive towards the common good. We have\ntherefore decided to bring up an issue that we\nattach great importance to, namely excessive\nposter abuse or poster pollution, as we put it.\n1. Although posters are necessary, the\namount of posters that are up at the moment\nis excessive and very often posters are placed\non no-poster areas.\n2. More posters means less trees.\n3. More posters means less effective posters\nsince no-one reads them.\n4. Clubs are spending a considerable amount\nof money on posters, which could be used\nmore constructively.\nTo set an example the Hellenic Society\nhereby undertakes to put no more than three\nposters per event in the designated poster\narea, and to take them down properly once\nthey expire.\nRemember, you don't need to be a member\nto be informed of the Hellenic Society's activities.

    "content": "baker-simon\nFirstly, let me assure you this is me, honest, not\nsome dod gy Canadian DJ trying to dupe you. It's good to talk, but there are limits. Since Her\nMajesty could hardly accuse someone of being an\nimpostor just in case, surely calls are checked to\nsee that they are from who they should be. I suspect that some switchboard operator may receive\na job transfer to the Tower of London.\nThe Beit Quad refurbishment fiasco rumbles\non with the news that, shock horror, it would be\nvery expensive to move the Union to Sherfield.\nNow the fact that everyone else in College knew\nthis from day one inevitably leads one to ask what\nthe hell College Estates are playing at. God only\nknows how much money has been wasted on\narchitect's fees and misguided feasibility studies.\nThe obvious way forward is to convert the Biology\ndepartment to provide accommodation and\nrefurbish Beit Hall thus giving the required conference facilities next to existing amenities. To\nmove all the administration and the Union was\nclearly going to be prohibitively expensive.\nHowever, the motives for wanting this are completely understandable. For the first time, senior\npeople in College have asked what actually gets\ndone in Sherfield. Why do we need such a large\ndepartment to manage an organisation the size of\nImperial, where a lot of decisions are taking by\nindividual departments anyway? By moving them\ninto a smaller building, this bureaucratic monster\ncould be reduced in size and made more efficient.\nNobody can dispute the chronic over manning in\nSherfield, where the various departments have\nexpanded unnecessarily to fill the available space.\nTo solve this, how about, for example, cutting the\nfat from departments such as the enormous\nRegistry that seems to do little apart from issue\nCouncil Tax exemption forms and add up our\nexam marks. Better still, why not put the whole\nof Sherfield administration out to competitive\ntender as has been done in the Civil Service.\nEarlier in the week, I read an article in the Daily\nTelegraph suggesting that in deprived inner city\nareas, teachers rather than parents are to blame\nfor the poor performance of children. Fair enough\nyou say. Must be written by some smart arse from\na right wing think tank who went to Eton. This\narticle was in fact written by a teacher who works\nin an inner city comprehensive which until about\nthree years ago was one of the worst performers\nin the country. By changing head teacher, scrapping lunatic progressive teaching methods and\ngetting, dare I say it, back to basics, GCSE pass\nrates have more than quadrupled in three years.\nTeaching unions are constant iy moaning about not\nbeing treated as a professional body of people, but\nit is hardly surprising that the vocal minority of\nbad teachers that cling to failed practices harm the\nwhole profession.\nAs regular as the National Lottery draw is the\ngriping and w hinge ing about this national in st it u tion. Recently there has been a storm of protest\nover the allocation of money. ToorightI say. I 've\nbeen buying tickets every week since it started\nand they haven't given me as much as ate nner. Being forced to watch Anthea Turner every week\nto check I have lost is almost too much to bear.\nmichael lud lam This is my third year at Imperial. The last two\nwent quite well. Exams were passed and course\nwork was relatively simple. I was enjoying myself,\nhad good friends. I was partaking in that getting\nolder bit, the whole learning experience. I came\nback ready to start my third year at the beginning\nof this month expecting more of the same.\nI got it wrong. Pretty much everything has\nchanged. It is as if everyone I know who is in their\nfinal year has been clipped in a whopping great vat\nof sincerity. As if someone somewhere is desperately trying to take out all the fun of being at col-leg e. The word on the street, in the lecture the-at re, in the bars has changed to \"jobs jobs jobs\" followed closely behind by \"marriage, mortgage and\nkids.\" It's getting kinda depressing. Suddenly I have all this work that needs doing today, not in\nMay like I was used too. Ok so maybe I was hugely naive, I didn't really listen to all those warnings\nabout this place. I discovered my worse fear -Imperial College means degree machine.\nThose who did not reach the hurdle of second\nyear exams have been discarded by the way side.\nNo more friendly res its, fall below and you're out.\nEven those who failed just one exam are no longer\nwelcome. It is hardly the friendly little sweet college I thought it was. It's like that pit monster in\none of the Star Wars films, it's gotta have those\nsacrifices. All those course work assignments and\nproblem sheets to satisfy the hungry beast. Eating\nup all our free time. It is starting to make me\nworry, oh I should be working, not writing this\ncolumn. I should stay in to work, not go out and\nmeet people and enjoy myself. It's like they no\nlonger want me to expand my horizons.\nIt is cyclic problem, the more one person worries about their mark it makes everyone else\nworry and so on. People are frightened of not\nkeeping up. We are all beavering away becoming\nexcellent scientists, engineers and medics but not\nvery good people. If you weren'ta geek when you\narrived they are trying hard to turn you into one.\nSo when it comes time to play, we play far too\nhard. How can the Rector be surprised that there\nis a big drink and drug problem here. What better\nway to forget all the stress than get completely off\nyour face so you remember none of it. We've all\ndone it haven't we? I have seen perfectly normal\ngood healthy people turn into nervous wrecks,\nthrough an excessively large work load.\nMy reckoning goes that college should be\nabout an experience, about joining the ride and\nenjoying yourself, enjoying your course and the\nrest of your life. Dare I say it, there is more to the\nride than your course. The pressures of the our\ncourse are immense. Does college really believe\nthat they only want good academics and not well\nbalanced individuals? However we do not have\nmuch choice, we have to play the game. What\nelse we do?\n\n"

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY NoveMBER 3RD1995 NEWS\nPhoto: William Lorenz\nUnfinished: Installation of smoke detectors has taken over a year\nFire Alarm Tests Continue BY THE NEWS TEAM Residents of Southside Halls are\nset to be subjected to daily early\nmorning fire alarm tests for\nanother month.\nThe alarms have been sounded at 9am each day since the\nunsuccessful fire practice on\nOctober 17th. Alarms failed to\ngo off on staircases two and four\nleaving residents unaware of the\nwarning to evacuate the building.\nHowever, Prof G New and Dr J Hassard, the hall's wardens, said\nthey were satisfied with the\nturnout of the other staircases. In\nan open letter to the four halls,\nthey said that there were to be no\nfurther fire practices this term,\nso alarms should be taken seri-ou sly. The source of the problem is\nthe 15 year old alarm control s ys tem, sections of which have\ntaken to spontaneous failure.\nDue to the disappearance of the\ninstallation details necessary for\nfault location, the only means of\ntracing failures is trying the system and seeing if it works. Faced\nwith concerns of student safety if\nthe system failed between test-in gs, Graham Cox, College Fire\nOfficer, said the system had\noverlap and that he was satisfied\nwith the level of protection currently offered.\nAlthough the present fire\nprotection is perfectly legal for\nstudent residences, it is well\nbelow the standard required by\nthe Fire Precaution Act (1972)\nfor paying members of the pub-li c. The sole reason Southside\ncurrently holds hotel status is\ndue to a loophole in the law. As it\nhas applied for certification,\npending a visit from the fire\ndepartment, the dubious nature\nof the system is given the benefit\nof the doubt.\nSimilar to one in Linstead\nHall, the system is currently\npartly installed and will be\nbrought on line over the next few\nweeks. It will have the capability\nto pinpoint fires down to the\nnearest room, report disablement\nor breakdowns and detect\ncannabis smoke. Students who\nburn their food are still a problem that hopefully the Fire\nDepartment will solve, but the\nnew hardware should be in place\nby the end of November until\nwhich time testing will continue.\nNews in brief\n'Beit Option'\nConsidered\nAn initial sounding of the 'Beit\nOption' has been the concern of\nImperial College's Estates\nDivision this week, as Ian Frame,\nDirector of Planning, went on a walk about with Union staff. The\nparty looked at the various parts\nof the Union building that would\nbe moved or altered if the proposal is taken up by the College.\nSarah White said that the\nCollege has been \"fiddling\naround with the idea\", and will\nbe doing some rough costing over\nthe next few weeks. She added\nthat most of the work has been\ndone already as the Biology part\nof Beit had been dissected in the\noriginal plans. However, Ian\nFrame commented that the idea\nhas not yet gone to the quantity\nsurveyors and reiterated that the\ncosts have to balance.\nLabour Whip\nStephen Byers, Labour MP for\nWallsend, was a guest of Imperial\nCollege Union Labour Club on\nOctober 20th. He is seen as one\nof the brightest young stars in the\nParliamentary Labour Party\nbecoming party Whip recently.\nHe spoke to a sizeable gathering on a range of issues including sleaze and arms sales to Iran\nand Iraq, both topical issues subject to inquiries by Nolan and\nScott. However, many members\nof the audience were surprised\nthat Mr Byers described himself\nas a socialist while very much\nbeing a supporter of Tony Blair's style and policies.\nOne of the more impressive\nof the Labour Club's guests, he\nvery capably fended off questions\nfrom Consoc members especially\nover local government. After one\nquestion he particularly emphasised that Conservative run\nWestminster Council is the only\none in the country which has\nbeen officially found corrupt, and\nthe council appointed solicitors\nwho refute these allegations are\nhardly 'independent'.\nMotor Show Protest\nTraffic around Earl's Court was\ndisrupted twice over the weekend as people demonstrated outside the London Motor Show.\nSecurity guards and Police were\ncalled in to restrain protesters as\nthey tried to clamber over the\nbarriers surrounding the building.\nLast Friday evening saw\n'Critical Mass', a cyclist pressure\ngroup, arriving at the Show for a rally after their monthly meet\nunder Waterloo bridge. The\ngroup of about a thousand\ncyclists proceeded slowly to the\nBrompton Road entrance of the\nshow. There they were confronted by locked gates and irate security guards. Along the route of\ntheir ride, the flow of traffic,\nalready fairly stagnant in the rush\nhour, ground to a halt with\nmotorists venting their irritation\nby sounding their horns.\nOne driver tried to force\nhis way through the crowd of\nbicycles but was advised by a Police Officer to stay put, much\nto the delight of the assembled\nmasses. The cyclists were keen to\nstress the peaceful nature of their\nprotest, aimed at demonstrating\nthe hypocrisy of motoring in\nLondon.\nOne individual expressed a desire \"to spread love and peace\"\nthroughout the capital by \"wav-ing and smiling at people\" as they\npassed.\nSunday had the 'Reclaim the\nStreets Action Network' out in\nforce opposite the Warwick Road\nentrance to Earl's Court. It was a much smaller demonstration\nthan Friday's but more vocal;\nchanting slogans and cheering\neach bus and booing each car that\npassed.\nThe protesters generated a lot of noise but were mainly ineffectual in disrupting the flow of\nvisitors to the show. At one point\nthey tried to bring their own\nChinese Dragon style model\nLondon Bus on to the road, but\nwere forcibly prevented from\ndoing so by a ring of Police.\n\n"

    "content": "O kay, I know many of you spend\nFriday morning in various states of\nconsciousness at the back of the\nlecture theatre. But have you\never wondered how much conscious control you have over your own thoughts\nand actions? This month at the Royal Society,\nJeffrey Gray, a professor of psychology at the\nInstitute of Psychiatry, discussed the problem of\nconsciousness and who should solve it.\nThere is very little agreement on what the\nproblem with consciousness is. Some people\nwill always argue that consciousness is a mystery\nof life that can never be explained. However,\nmost scientists now agree that consciousness is\nsomehow linked to brain activity. Have you ever\nhad too many beers and noticed the pub spinning around you? If so you will 'realise that substances like alcohol, which alter brain chemistry,\nalso alter consciousness. Perhaps then, a good\nplace to begin understanding consciousness is to\nlook at what makes the brain special. The trouble is, of course, that scientists are still arguing\nabout the best way to do this.\nHistorically, neuroscientists have gained a lot\nof insight into the workings of the brain by\nstudying patients with brain damage.\nOccasionally we get a glimpse into another per-son's consciousness: for example, patients who\nbehave as if the left side of space, and even their\nown bodies, had ceased to exist. Dr. Oliver\nSacks, author oi Awakenings and The Man Who\nMistook His Wife For A Hat has written some\nof the most sympathetic and wonderful tales I have ever read about people suffering from\nthese unimaginable mental conditions.\nMany neuroscientists believe that consciousness will ultimately be explained in terms of\nbrain structure and the firing of groups of neu-Can You Believe Your Brain? It's all in the mind\nSarah Tomlin grapples with consciousness\n'pf tiC^ TJ.:^ \u2022 MK \"\u00a3:\n\\.. /i>t> g. wife 'fM ,':\u2022;, Miy:\"ky;.:\nThe Margaret Thatcher\nIllusion\nFilling in the gap: Cover\none eye, stare at the dot on\nthe right-the lines on the\nleft should join up.\nIs This a Spiral?\nron s. But another alternative is a kind of panpsychism (unfortunately nothing to do with a small\nguy with a goatee and pointy ears playing the\npipes) in which all matter shares in conscious-ness. This view has recently been expressed by\nthe mathematician Roger Penrose in his book\nThe Emperor's New Mind: concerning com put ers, minds and the laws of physics. He suggests\nthat the secret of consciousness may have something to do with the mysteries of quantum mechanics, since science has so far\nfailed to explain either properly.\nAs a psychologist, Jeffrey\nGray believes that a satisfactory\ntheory of consciousness should\ntry to explain as many aspects of\nit as possible and should be able\nto answer some key questions. How did conscious experience evolve and how does it help\nan animal survive? How are conscious experiences linked to brain events and how do they\nalter behaviour? The problem with such an\nambitious, all-embracing approach, is that the\nconcept of consciousness is so rich and complex\nthat Professor Gray admits he has not\nyet come up with a simple definition of it. He is not alone in this:\nFrancis Crick has written \"we did\nnot attempt to define consciousness itself because of the clangers\nof premature definition.\" (If this\nseems like a cop-out, try defining\nthe word \"gene\" - you will not find\nit easy).\nSometimes it is easier to begin\ndefining something by what it is\nnot, and it is astonishing how\nmuch subconscious activity takes\nplace in our brains. There is a lot\nof experimental evidence to show\nthat consciousness always comes\nafter the brain processes to which\nit is linked and more importantly,\nit comes too late to affect them.\nThis agrees with the observation .\nthat conscious events occur serial-\"\nly while neural processing operates\nin parallel. During the few seconds or so that it takes you to read\nthis sentence, your eyes are following the words,\nyour brain is mentally processing their shape and\nmeaning, but how much of this activity are you\nactually aware of ?\nThis raises the question that if so much brain\nactivity and subsequent behaviour is subconscious (including reflex actions , such as removing your hand from a hot stove) then what does\nconscious experience add to our behaviour that\nthe subconscious cannot do by itself? Jeffrey\nGray explains\n\"Along with everything else that that, This, by\nFreud got wrong, he also the^ \u00bb not \u2022 , \u2022 ,i, Freudian sub con wrongly treated the sub cons c \u20220us ness s cio us as a mystery.\" Along with\neverything else\nthat Freud got wrong, he also wrongly treated\nthe subconscious as a mystery. It is not.\"\nIncreasingly, scientists understand in more and\nmore detail how the firing of neurons is linked\nto subconscious behaviour. It is the fact that\nsome of this mental activity becomes conscious\nthat is the real mystery.\nLoo link Researchers in 'California have recently demo hi:st rated vision without awareness (also called\n'blind sight') in normal sighted volunteers,\nBlindsight has previously h bed in so in e patients vw ' ' ll iii not se 'ss:f he location ol objects near them, they per f btn l well\nabove the level oi pure chance.

David Corelli is an assistant district attorney who\nis called to investigate the murder of a prominent\nmillionaire. While investigating the crime, he is\nconfronted with the fact that Trina Gavin (Linda\nFiorentino from The Last Seduction), the wife\nof his best friend and the woman he has been in\nlove with since college, is the prime suspect.\nClues which lead to the suspect are fingerprints on the murder weapon; sightings of Trina\nvisiting the millionaire's beach house; and a silver\nbox engraved with the Chinese character for\nJade - the name of one of the millionaire's many\nlovers.\nFiorentino gives a cool, if unsurprising performance as a two-timing clinical psychologist.\nMentally Trina appears to be a bit of a weirdo\nand sexually she is very liberated - a side of her\npsyche which her husband is ignorant about.\nWritten by Basic Instinct screenwriter Joe\nEszterhas, Jade contains few surprises. The millionaire who is into bon king young attractive\nwomen and the attorney who is in love with the\nprime suspect have both featured in films of this\ntype before. There is, of course, the obligatory\ncar chase thrown in but this comes across as\nbeing so preposterous and clumsily filmed that it\ndoes little to raise the adrenaline levels of the\naudience.\nFor the first half hour or so, Jade seems\nunpromising although Shawn Murphy's music\nscore does well to build up the tension in the\nopening scene where the murder is heard but\nnot seen.\nIn the end director William Friedkin does\nmanage to shape an entertaining film, even\nthough it is a bit predictable and tacky at times.\nfilm: the horseman on the\nrOOf nag pie The Horseman on the Roof, or for those endearing people biking level three French the original\ntitle is Le Hussard sur le Toit, will be playing at\nthe London Film Festival on Monday.\nIt's1830' s France and cholera is spreading\nlike a wild rumour through the country obliterating villages and leaving dead bodies for the\nscavenging crows. Angelo is a colonel of the\nHussars fleeing the Austrian agents sent to\ntrack him down, for Italy has been invaded by\nAustria. The words viva Italia' are Angelo's, and\nhe defends them with fist and sword.\nAngelo finally arrives in Manosque searching\nfor his friend Guiseppe. The local population has\nbeen driven mad by the paranoia of the cholera\nepidemic. Only hysteria and chaos rule, and after\nbeing falsely accused of poisoning the local water\nwell, Angelo is driven onto the rooftops. Above\nhim are the crows waiting for him to die and\nbelow the mob want to hang him.\nThe rain comes and Angelo finds shelter in\nan attic where he meets Pauline, an elegant\nwoman whose calmness and relaxed attitude is a stark contrast to the death crazed mob: a chance\nencounter which is lost by the morning ,as she\nhas gone. Their paths cross again and Angelo\nfeels obliged to help Pauline on her journey to\nfind her husband. The journey is fraught with\ndanger, avoiding the cholera and the army, who\nare enforcing quarantine, but Angelo still makes\nthe detour.\nThe Horseman on the Roof is adapted from\nthe book by Jean Giono: some adaptations seem\nto skim over events trying to squash everything\ninto 100 minutes, but The Horseman on the Roof\nis the complete opposite. It is long, and each\nminute is saturated with events. Characters\ncome and go but the overall feeling is everything\nis known about them only after a short dialogue.\nEach screen is complemented by the changing\nscenery, as Angelo and Pauline's journey takes\nthem to a different idyllic part of France.\nDirector Jean-Paul Rappeneau binds the\nfilm together well as the large number of events\nand different backdrops would usually just create confusion. Each scene flows effortlessly into\nanother and you slowly become amazed by\nAngelo's character; his resourcefulness, strength\nand the pity he shows to the dying, risking his\nown health. Pauline then strikes you as a stub-bom woman, caring only for herself and her\ndesire to find her husband. There is a love story\nin this film somewhere, but it doesn't surface\nuntil late in the film, since Angelo is an army officer and so hides his love behind his honour and\nhe does it obviously a bit too well.\nOverall The Horseman on the Roof is a good\nfilm, with an authentic setting in an grim but\ninteresting period in history. However\nRappaneau never lets you forget the bitter taste\nwhen people die at random and the look of fear,\ndeath and pain in each victim's sunken eyes.\n\n"

Because, after seeing ex-Alarm frontman Mike Peters performing an\nacoustic show of songs old and new, the only\nconclusion I can draw is that The Alarm weren'ta great band - they were a brilliant one. (But then\nI really knew that anyway.)\nness, he jovially retorted: \"I think that we've got\na few trains potters in here tonight.\"\nAnd yet it's remarkable that there aren't more of the same sort of 'trains potters' around.\n'68 Guns', Where were you hiding when the\nstorm broke?', 'Spirit of 76', 'One step closer to\nhome' and 'No frontiers', to name but a few, are\nsongs that take in influences as diverse as the\nClash and the Stones, that had something unpretentious and important to say, and yet which lie\nneglected by so many.\nNot that this is supposed to sound like an\nepitaph.

On one occasion, when\na large number of obscurities were being\nrequested by fans eager to prove their die-hard i material, mainly taken from last year's debut,\n'Breathe', stands up entirely on its own merits.\nThe new songs may not have quite managed to\ncapture the exquisite ness of old yet but as\nproven tonight, they will certainly age well. And\nin an era of meaningless, hungover music culture,\nthat's way more than you've reason to expect.\nlike I once said - Mike Peters deserves your\nattention now.\nalbum: the smashing\npumpkins - mellon collie\nand infinite sadness^s shopper To spend 24 hours with the Smashing Pumpkins\nwould be impossible joy. To spend two hours or\nso with this album in their royal presence is thus\nbut a bare able compression. Split betwixt two\nhalves, per fec dy complementary, like night and\nday, dawn and dusk, rest 28 new tracks. The two\nCDs, crammed with the same number of years\nworth of Billy Corgan's meticulously woven\nmelodies, may be verging on the verbose, but\nthen we're not being given a tour of McD's. In contrast with most other big bands, the\nPumpkins haven't \"matured\", \"progressed\", or\n\"diversified\", not because they tried not to, but\nbecause everything they do is peculiarly idiosyncratic. Corgan's lyrics may be at times self-in d ul gent, not to mention inaccessible, but songs like\n'Bodies', 'Thirty-three' and 'Bullet with...'\nredeem his stature and hark to the earlier days of\n'Gish' and 'Siamese Dream'.\nThough not every track is a gorging grunge\nlandmark, to attempt superficial comparisons to\n80's style revival would be totally out of place.\nSweet cherish able numbers like 'Stumbleine',\n'By starlight' and 'Farewell and goodnight' are\nevidence enough for me that Corgan's talent,\nrelent ies sly emitted from my CD player, is\nunique.\nIncidentally, the last song calls on the hitherto unexposed voice of James Iha, making you\nwonder if this man could possibly attain saint iy status. He also wrote \"Take me down\" (a sure\ncontender for the tide of best-track) not so\nmuch a love song as a ray of hope at the twilight\nof Corgan's bitter day. I wish it was mine.\nNow you may think that dais is hopeless\ninfatuation, but you'd be wrong. There is no\nother reason to buy this album other than for\npure musical delight. Don't pretend you need to\nunderstand it, you don't.(8) "

    "content": "...the slightest\nexertion would\nmr\nWith 3 weeks rem air ring of our holiday we broke\nsouth from Peru and\ncrossed the border into\nBolivia at the border town\nof Copacabana.\nBolivia is the poorest country in the western\nhemisphere and it certainly shows, there are\nonly 2 paved roads in the whole of the country\nand luckily we travelled one of them into La\nPaz. La Paz is renowned as being the highest\ncapital in the world - not true. It is not the\ncapital of Bolivia, merely its biggest city and\ncentre of commerce... I digress. More worrying\nthan La Paz's lack of bona fide tide is its lack of\nbreathable air; sat in a valley below the Andean\nAltiplano it is at 4000m above sea level and is\nwhere Olympic\nathletes train before\ncompetitions. After\nlife in London, a good 30m above sea\nlevel (50m if you're\non the second floor)\nLa Paz proved to be\nliterally breath-taking\nand the slightest\nexertion would leave\nyou gasping like a fish on dry land. The\none advantage of all\nthis puffing and\npanting is that upon\nreturn to Britain, you\nfeel like you have\nsuper-human\nstrength.\nSouth East of La\nPaz lies the city of\nPotsoi. A silver town\nduring Spanish m le, it is now mined cooperatively by the local men. These \"men\"\n(starting at age 10) live on what silver they\nmine, some carry over a ton of metal ore on\ntheir backs in a day in tunnels 4ft high by\ncandlelight and for their trouble they will earn\n\u00a35 a day. They are doing well if they live to be\n50, though many will die in cave-ins before\nthat. They only let us 'Gringos' in because we\ncome bearing gifts; coca leaves for their\nendurance, fuel for their lamps, dynamite for\ntheir mining, that sort of thing.\nSouth West of Potsoi in the Altiplano lies one\nof the world's largest salt plains, the 'Salar\nd 'Uyuni'. 10 billion tons of virtually pure salt\nstretching dead flat across hundreds of square\nkilometres of land, broken up only by the\noccasional lone island of rock. Local belief is\nthat it was formed when the seas dried up and\nall of the fish were turned into islands. When I asked why Bolivia's economic situation could\nnot be improved by export of this salt, I was\ntold of how Chile took Bolivia's one access to\nthe ocean rendering it landlocked. This land\nwill be returned within a decade when Chile\nhas exhausted the\nsilver mines there\nwhich currently\nconstitute 10% of its\nm Gross Domestic\nProduct.\nH From Uyuni I travelled back to La\nPaz on one of the\nworld's highest\nrailways and from\nLa Paz back to Lima\nand from there to\nLondon. The\nsadness at leaving\nthese places and\n\u2022 especially the people\nwas immense. The\ngeography is\nstunning but it is the\npeople that endear\nthemselves to you.\nI They're not in the\nrat race, they take\neach day as it comes\nand it may sound\nblessedly simple but its not - its hard. Its also\nextremely well worth seeing with your own\neyes. Contact me, James Madden, via the Felix\noffice if you like.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 3RD NOVEMBER 1995 . FIVE\nu Freddie Starr ate my grant!\"\nThe political consensus\nregarding the future of higher\neducation is at first sight seam-less, differing only in the choice\nof buzzwords. All parties propose\npassing on some of the cost of\nhigher education to the students\n- an acknowledgement at last\nthat the tax system cannot\nentirely support a mass higher\neducation system.\nThe Conservative National\nPolicy Group on HE, along with\nLabour and the Lib Dem's would\nlike to see HE expansion continued and sincerely believe that\nthey can do this without raising\ndoubts about quality.\nThe actual outcome will of\ncourse depend on the result of\nthe next election, but also on the\ncontribution that the student\nmovement makes to this discus-sion. And this is where the problems begin.\nEarlier this year the NUS\nconfirmed its anachronistic and\nUtopian posture by refusing to\nsupport a call for ruthless reform\nof HE funding. Instead it grasped\non to the ephemeral tenet on\nwhich its existence depends - a restoration of grants to 1979 levels and reinstatement of benefits.\nThe NUS finances depend\non student acceptance of credulous platitudes which are\nwheeled out to every dewy eyed\nand shivering fresher counting\npennies at Christmas. Any helpful idea has to combat student\npoverty, explode the myth of\n'free education' and reject the\nPerhaps not, but Nooman Haque\nexplains who might soon.\npatronising doctrine that society is in debt to students.\n'New Solutions' is an\nassemblage of 100 student\nunions who are encouraging\nstudents to partake in the\ndebate. The group is lead by\nGhassan Karrian, President\nof ULU and supported by\nSarah White, President\nof Imperial.\nI do not do ub the sincerity of this\nmovement but I do question the\nmotives of Mr\nKarrian. The J clue which\ngives the\ngame away\nis the adjunct ive 'New' - the Blair hallmark to describe rehashed\nTory policies.\nThe incumbent Baron of\nCastle Malet will be only too\npleased to show you around his\nKingdom, and in particular\nshow off his treasure trove of\nprominent Labour front\nbench ers. Mr. Karrian (a Labour councillor) appears to\nbe destined for the Commons\nand in this respect his actions\ncould be interpreted as part of\nhis career drive (though stories\nof students slipping up on the\nroad from Bloomsbury to\nWhitehall as a result of his oily\nprogress are unsubstantiated).\nX> a a2H One could also assume that\nhe is testing Labour policy\namongst the students and thus\nworking more for them than\nfor those that was elected to\nserve. The issue is a serious one\nand remains to be resolved. Mr\nKarrian is paid by ULU\nand should act and\nthink in\naccord ance with the\nneeds of\nJ his con-st it u ents, not\nthose of his\nLabour friends.\nThe effects that a politically biased\nnational student\norganisation have been\ndevastating to the student movement in the\npast. In 1992 the NUS encouraged students to vote Labour in\nmarginal constituencies. This\nhigh profile campaign only\nencouraged the Conservative\ngovernment to speed up it's Voluntary Membership Billdesigned to curb student union\npower and remove government\nfunding for student sports,\nsocieties and entertainments.\nThe actions of the NUS nearly\nkilled off the SU's that pay a premium for it's rather shoddy\nservice. This greedy cabal of\nLeftists should be dismantled\nand the (comparatively) efficient\nservices (NUS Legal and NUS\nEnts) should go their separate\nways, allowing subscribing SU's to pay according to their specific\nneeds\nI wonder too if the other\nstudent unions involved in 'New'\nSolutions are aware of Mr.\nKarrian's left leaning tendency,\nparticularly our own Ms. White,\nwho has offered her e mail\naddress to field enquiries about\nthe group.\nPerhaps Miss White is aware\nbut fears the charismatic Mr\nKarrian, or perhaps she too has\nambitions Westminster way (it is\nmore likely however that she\nskips happily through the blossoming meadows of ignorance\nand innocence and to credit her\nwith being so shrewd as Mr.\nKarrian is a generous and purely\nhypothetical extension of her\nabilities).\nEither way, the lack of a clear statement declaring political impartiality clouds the important debate which Mr Karrian\nand Miss White have entrusted\nthemselves to lead. Their desire\nto encourage student wide\ndebate is welcome but with the\ncloud of uncertainty over their\nmotives is rather hard to lift. If\nwe are to provide input into the\ndebate, Mr. Karrian, we must\nknow what and for whom you\nstand.\nOPTIONS: The major parties' views on higher education funding.\nConservative Party\nKeep lid on growth of HE and\ndevelop more lower level cours-es. Eventual elimination of grant\nand introduction of comprehensive loan system to cover main te nance. Radical Tories want\nvouchers for fees payment.\nLabour Party\nContinued expansion of HE, creating \"Seamless robes of learn-ing\", \"University for Industry\",\n\"learning accounts\" and \"learning\nbank\" i.e students, state and\nemployers contribute to a reservoir of cash. Don't like fees\nvouchers but favour \"learning\nentitlements\".\nLiberal Democrats\nContinued expansion of HE. Also\nfavour \"learning accounts\".\nMaintenance paid for by state\nand fees paid back after second\nyear.\nNUS\nReinstatement of housing benefit\nand income support. Return to\n1979 level of student grant\n(approx cost at least 7p on\nincome tax).\nNew Solutions\nLoan system for maintenance\ngrants. Employer contributions\nfor tuition.\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 3RD1995 LETTERS\nLETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY ALEX FEAKES\nHam and\ne^ heads\nDear Ed,\nI would like to appeal to any ICU\nmember interested in ham radio.\nThe Union's amateur radio club,\nHamsoc, is currently inactive and\nneeds keen members (especially\nlicence holders) to get it up and\nrunning once more.\nThe club owns \u00a315,000 of\nequipment and has been allocated a budget for the coming academic year. If anyone is interested\nin either running or joining the\nclub, could they please drop me a line via the RCC Exec, pigeon\nholes in the Union office.\nYours etc.\nRobert Lea,\nRCC Chairman.\nDear Sir or Madam,\nIt's all\nGreek to me\nThis is in reply to last week's letter by Mr Daniel Figueras-Niets.\nSince I cannot comment on anything said in council meeting that\nDaniel refers to (I was not pre-sent) this is aimed at anyone who\nthinks that overseas students are\ninactive in Union matters.\n37% of the college's student\npopulation is of non-British origin\n('overseas students'). This percentage puts Imperial among the\nmost multicultural academic\ninstitutions in the world.\nAfter twelve months of the\nwork in the Union as the OSC\nChairman last year, I can safely\nsay that overseas students contribute much to the Union's life\nboth through the overseas societies and the rest of Clubs and\nSocieties. 'International Night' is\nthe largest student organised\nevent of ICU. It is not, however,\nthe case that overseas societies\norganise events for the sake of\noverseas societies alone. Just\ncheck the article in this week's issue by the Hellenic Society and\nall this comes into context.\nTo conclude, it's the 'ancient\ncurse' of our college that IC students don't really get involved\nwith IC matters; but of those few\nthat do, at least 37% are overseas.\nSincerely Yours,\nAndreas Mershin.\nOSC Chairman 1994/95,\nPhysics Ac Rep 95/96.\nIt is a shame that your letter\nquickly slides into being an\nadvert for OS C events rather\nthan taking the opportunity to\nanswer the letter and the issue.\nDear Felix,\nI was concerned and quite\nfrankly amazed to read the inaccurate comments Mr. Figueras\nNiets attributed to me in last\nweeks Felix. Not surprisingly he\nseems unable to remember the\nhalf of what was said some three\nweeks after the event. As a result\nI feel obliged to explain exactly\nwhat I said and in what context.\nAt the council meeting in\nquestion I was outlining how\nImperial College is fundamentally different from other British\nUniversities. At one point I explained how Imperial has;\n\"Many foreign students as well as\nstudents on 9 to 5 courses who\nthen don't give a shit about the\nUnion.... They are here only to\nget a degree.\" I never once\naccused 'foreigners' exclusively\nbut merely highlighted why many\nof Imperial's members, British or\notherwise, are so apathetic\ntowards their Union.\nI find it only natural that students faced with high academic\nwork loads are not wholly enthusiastic at the idea of working for\nthe Union in their spare time.\nIndeed the demands placed upon\na student studying in a language\nother than their own seem truly\nhorrific. However I would like to\ntake this opportunity to detail\nthe reality of student representation at iCU.\nThere at present some 2639\nforeign nationals studying at\nCollege making up 36.5 % of\nImperial's student body. Out of\nthe 52 officers involved in the\nrunning of Union activities only 5\nare from overseas. In fact even\nthe Overseas Clubs Committee\nChairman is himself British! The\nquality of Imperial is largely due\nto the quality of it's overseas students but it is quite clear there is\nconsiderable shortfall in their\ninvolvement in running NonAcademic matters.\nI am sorry Mr Figueras-Niets\n'felt undignified' [sic], but I would appreciate it if he could in\nfuture check his facts before portraying me as some un-informed\nracial bigot. In short, I apologise\nto all Overseas students for Mr\nFN's misinterpretation of my\ncomments but I feel I have no\nreason to apologise for what I actually said and what I believe.\nYours Sincerely,\nTim Townend, DP(Clubs and\nSocieties).\nThank you for allowing us a glimpse into the Union's book of\nrecords, but what was actually\nsaid or the backgrounds of the\nstudents referred to fades in\nimportance against the perceived\nattitudes of the students, their\nUnion and their Sabbaticals.\nStudents will only get involved\nin activities and events that\ninterest or cater for them, so to\ncomplain that people do not get\ninvolved is more an expression of\nthe fact that you cannot be all\nthings to all people.\nOpportunities are there for all to\nget involved: Imperial's multicultural nature is a strength,\nallowing exposure for students\nto other cultures.\nLetters may be\ncommented on by a guest\neditor whose\nopinions are not\nnecessarily those of the editor.\nDeadline for letters:\n6pm Monday.\nPlease bring your union\ncard for\nidentification.\nHall Vacancies\nPlaces are now available in twin and triple rooms for new or continuing undergraduate and\npostgraduate students in halls of residence (Evelyn Gardens and Prince's Gardens).\nSingle rooms are available in Clayponds for postgraduate students. Please contact the\nStudent Accommodation Office, 15 Prince's Gardens (tel: 0171 594 9444).\n\n"

    "content": "gig/interview: trans-global\nunderground xi\nAfter an excellent set from Tribal Drift,\nsome funky hip-hop from Eusebe and admirable\nmixing from Coldcut, we were finally treated to\nTransglobal Underground. So was it worth the\nwait?\nWell, quite a few of the crowd failed to take\nthe pace when confronted with an extended 90\nminute set and encore. The music was never\nfrantic but the beats grabbed you by the scruff of\nthe neck and forced you to dance. I was surprised by the breadth of the set, which had\neverything from crashing guitar riffs and rapping\nto extensive bongo and drum workouts.\nand is the driving force that holds their diverse\nsound together.\nThe band hopes to find time in the New Year\nto take a month of gigging to record a new\nalbum, from which they should get an entirely\nnew live set. If the material they played tonight\nis anything to go by, then this will be well worth\nchecking out.\nAsked if they have any message to get across,\nDubla said that they want to try and break down\nbarriers in music, building on the start they've\nalready made. Apparendy, Natacha wants to see\nmulti-ethnic music raised to the same level of\nprominence that it has in France, Belgium and\nthe Netherlands, where it receives regular radio\nplay.\nii stir u Before the gig, I chatted to the band's bassist,\nDubla, who promised that they would play four\nor five new songs. They didn't disappoint and\nalthough the fans cheered the fam i liar 'na-na,\nna-na-ner' of old favourite 'Temple Head', I couldn't help di in king that it was overshadowed\nby the newer material.\nIt's easy to see how vocalist Natacha Atlas\nmaintains a solo career in addition to her work\nwith the band. Her mix of singing and Indian\nstyle chants underpins all of Transglobal's music\nIf there is one thing the band hates, it's pigeon-holing. Dubla tells me half-jokingly that if\nthey ever manage to completely categorise\nTransglobal then he'll move on. He talks at length\non the stupidity of the system and decides that\nhe wants Transglobal to be the next Britpop\nband. Tme to his word the band announced,\n'Well, well, Britpop goes multiracial\" over the\nPA at the end of the gig. Looking at the smiles on\npeople's faces after the gig, I can only hope so.\nalbum: superchunk -here's where the strings\ncome ir uk It's all in a name. Unfortunately for Superchunk,\nthe reference to large vomit' in their name is\ntrue. The band appear to be Bob Mould\nwannabe es who have veered towards Madder\nRose but lost the whole plot along the way, while\n'Here's where the strings come in' sounds as\nthough it was recorded in someone's garage on a DAT machine.\nRecent single, Hyper Enough' is the highest\nquality fare on offer. But, it's the first song and\nfrom here on the album gets progressively worse.\nFrom 'Iron On' onwards there is a deep gorge of\nsongs that all sound the same so it's not a case of\nthe best being save .until last.\nI had great hopes for this album since\nSuperchunk had supported the great Teenage\nFanclub. Alas, this time the Fannies' judgement\nproved to be just about as good as Jacques\nChirac's nuclear policy. Oh well, we all make\nmistakes. (3)\nalbum: asian dub\nfoundation - facts and\nfictions,.\ni aul shore\nI didn't know what to expect but I was\nimpressed right from the start of this album with\nthe fusion of Eastern rhythms and Western\nbeats.\nThe album contains a unique blend of musical genres, with tracks ranging from the incredibly mellow 'Journey' to some very hard edged\nrap tunes towards the end of the album. They\neven lay a strong, funky electric guitar sound over\na jungle beat on 'TH9', while 'Thacid' could have\nbeen written by Josh Wink.\nAs their name would suggest, there are a lot\nof Asian style melodies. However, these are not\nso much emphasised as blended in with the varied collection of instrumental and sampled\nsounds and this mixture of styles compensates\nfor the lyrics, which sound a little harsh at times.\nAll in all, the twelve tracks cover a lot of\nground and this is well worth a listen.

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 7 TH1995 NEWS\nCouncil Elections\nwill be Re-run\nOne of the shortest Emergency\nCouncils on record met on\nTuesday night to consider a motion put forward by the\nExecutive Committee \"that\nCouncil nullify the elections of\nordinary members that took\nplace at its meeting on 10th October and that new elections\nshould take place.\" The motion\nwas supported by a handout distributed by those most incensed\nby the original election's'un constitutionality'. A bone of contention was\nwhether or not the proposing\npapers for ordinary members\nshould have gone up for two\nweeks prior to the elections. This\nwould have made all Union\nmembers aware of the forthcoming elections, so they could stand\nif they so wished. However, it\nwas established at the meeting\nthat the constitution is ambiguous on this point, and that many\ninterpretations could have been\nmade.\nPoints were raised over the\npracticality of running the elections again, and the principle of\nhaving open elections not exclusive to those in the know. Sarah\nWhite said that the motion was\nmeant to address peoples' feelings over the first elections, and\nthat, if passed, the papers for the\nposts would go up the day after.\nThe debate continued for twenty\nminutes before being called to a vote by the Council Chair, and\nthe motion was passed by 12\nvotes to 9, there being 31 voting\nmembers present.\nOxfam Cash Stolen\nin Raid on Rag\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nAn estimated \u00a3300 of rag\nfund ra is i hg for Oxfam was stolen\nfrom the ICU building last\nWednesday. Rag collectors had\nspent Wednesday afternoon in\nEmbankment station, and had\nleft the profits in the rag office\non the west side of Beit Quad\novernight. The proceeds from a collection in aid of Oxfam went\nmissing sometime after 7pm. IC\nSecurity discovered that the window had been removed whilst\npatrolling later that evening, but\nthe loss of money was only discovered the next morning.\nSpeaking on behalf of the\nRag committee, Eleanor Tench\nspeculated that the perpetrators\nwere IC students with some\nknowledge of the union building\nas the charity collection buckets\nwere later found in the union\nchanging rooms. \"I don't understand the mentality of someone\nwho would steal from charity\"\nshe said. \"Freshers have got up at\nsix o 'clock in the morning to col-lect, and some bastard's got the\nproceeds in their pocket... we're\nvery very angry.\"\nJohn Lambert, currently Rag\ntreasurer, is temporarily overseeing the Rag committee in the\nabsence of an elected chair. The\nprevious incumbent, Richard\nWillis, resigned last month after\nbeing criticised when a first year\nstudent was found drunk on the\nwalkway after the rag fresher's event.\nGET READY GET FRESH!

    "content": "FELIX The student newspaper of\nImperial College\nIssue 1039\nNovember 3rd1995 Linstead Scapegoated in Halloween Debacle\nBY JONATHAN TROUT The most serious disturbances of\nthe term occurred on Tuesday\nnight, when the activities of\nLinstead and Southside residents\nresulted in the Police being called\nto Prince's Gardens. The complaints of local residents have further resulted in the indefinite\nclosure of the Linstead Bar.\nThe annual Southside\nHalloween party, held on the\nbuilding's upper gallery, developed into a lively occasion with a constant, but not especially high,\nlevel of noise emanating from the\nhigh rise block. This was not a particular problem until a fire\nalarm in Linstead Hall led to the\nexpulsion of at least 150 students\ninto the Prince's Gardens area.\nWith some of the newly\narrived fresher s in a fairly inebriated state, the ritual banter started up between Southside and\nLinstead Halls. Following the\nretreat of the Linstead Hall residents after the all clear, the\nSouthside residents were then\nrequired to evacuate their halls\nwhen their fire alarms sounded.\nWith students now in fine voice,\nthe exchange continued between\nthe grounded Southsiders and\nthe Linstead revellers.\nUpon the arrival of Ian\nCaldwell, Director of Estates,\nthe Linstead residents gave\ngrudging acquiescence to his\nrequests for calm, and returned\ninside. At this point the incident\nshould have ended, but for a further fire alarm in Linstead Hall.\nFollowing this evacuation the\npolice arrived on the now\ncharged, yet good humour ed, scene. After a short chat with\nEarl Lancaster, the Linstead Hall\nWarden, the police departed.\nAfter some coercive words\nAlbert Hall Awaits\nLottery funding\nAlbert Hall spokespeople have\ndismissed suggestions in national\npapers that they have already\nreceived \u00a340m in Lottery funding Page 3\nfrom their Warden, the Linstead\nresidents returned inside, in\nmost cases to their rooms.\nHowever John Hassard, Warden\nof Falmouth Keogh Hall, who\nwas not present at the scene,\ncommented: \"it was like a riot,\nand riotous behaviour is deeply\nregretful.\"\nThe concern of College\nauthorities over the allegedly\nhigh level of student alcohol consumption later manifested itself\nwith the Rector, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh's instruction, to close\nLinstead Hall's bar. Some have\nraised questions as to the wisdom\nof this action. One of the Bar\nCommittee members working\nthat evening told Felix that most\nof the student drinking took\nplace not in the Linstead bar but\nin the Southside Disco.\nWith the Director of Estates\nbeing close at hand in his 47\nPrince's Gardens College flat to\nwitness the proceedings, residents have been told officially by\nthe Rector that the bar will not\nbe available until students\n'behave in a reasonable and\nresponsible' manner.\nWith suggestions that\nCollege has been seeking to close\nthe bar for some time, residents\nspeculate whether the popular\nsocial amenity will ever reopen.\nThis, together with the unfairness of not closing Southside's more profitable licensed premises were matters on which neither Sir Ronald or Mr Caldwell\nwere available to comment. Both\nthe ICU President, and Mr\nLancaster were said to be \"bewildered\" by the decision. Sarah\nWhite said: \"This seems like a violent, knee-jerk reaction from\nsomeone not in possession of all\nthe facts.\"\n\n"

So much so in this case that the design\nand direction outshines what is a very creditable\nperformance by a largely well-known cast. The\nproduction as a whole is an outstanding success\nfor Matthew Warchus in his debut as a professional director on the London stage. Jonson is\nconsidered by many to be the English Moliere, a theory successfully borne out by Warchus in this\nproduction.\nJonson's black comedy revolves around the\n\"Venetian miser Volpone who feigns sickness in\norder to trick the wealthy of Venice into bestowing gifts on him. For these acts, they believe they\nshall be the sole benefactor of his will, beliefs\nreinforced by Volpone's parasite and trickster,\nMosca. Following his performance in the BBC's The Singing Detective, Michael Gambon is a natural Volpone, although it would be nice to see\nhim play something other than a sick man and a grumpy bachelor.\nSimon Russell Beale had little difficulty in\nstealing the audience's affections as the intriguing\nyet loathsome Mosca. But the star of the show\nwas Robin Soan's Corvino, the foolish Venetian\nmerchant who even tries to get Volpone to sleep\nwith his wife in order to claim his fortune. He\nhad the audience completely convinced, and the\ntwo faced nature of his character was captured\nperfectly.\nOverall it is a superb production.\ntheatre: trouble sleeping\ngrasshopper\nSome 10 minutes after leaving Victoria we\npulled into a station that looked like it had been\npulled out of an inter-galactic airport. \"Canary\nWharf?\" I mused. The huge, towering, grey-white office block glistening in the lights\nin front of me would have been enough\nto fool the keane st Fleet Street Editor.\nBut no, sure as I had expected I was in...\nwait for it... East Croydon!\nYou may have thought that\nCroydon is nothing but a dull, leafy sub-ur b. But tucked away just behind the\nrailway station in the upstairs floor of a like-named pub (as fringe theatres\nalways are) lies \"The Warehouse\". With\narni nute to spare I hurried into the darkened theatre, the audience looked at me\nexpect and y,I bowed... and took my\nseat.\nAn established focus of local thespian enthusiasm, the Warehouse was\npreparing to be graced by a production\nof the prodigal Aussie, Nick Ward.\nTrouble Sleeping is his seventh production (not including his 3 prize-winning\nfilms), which at the age of 33, is a lengthy repertoire.\nThe play opens with Rosemary\nDaley (Sandra Voe) watching an egg boil\n- for the full three minutes. Perhaps it's a device to paint a picture that is as simple as can be of Rosemary and her son\nTerry (Peter-Hugo Daly) but it is also a metaphor\nfor the shell that is their life which - under a little pressure - can so easily crack.\nTerry is a BR worker who harbours an obsession with fire-arms which takes shape in his\npredilection for clay-pigeon shooting. However,\nthings take a sharp change in direction when\nRosemary finds out that her well married sister,\nUrsula (Eve Pearce), is ill and will be coming to\nlive in her old home once more. As if this weren'ta bad enough upset for poor Terry, Ursula invites\nAngela (Miranda Pleasance), an attractive run-away, to live in the Daley house-hold. This all\nproves too much for Terry when his secret pom\nvideos are discovered - the only release for his\nsexual frustrations. He is torn between loyalty\nand love for his mother and the sorry state of\ndenial he suffers through his attraction to Angela\nwh uch finally cracks his manly shell.\nIt's not that Nick Ward doesn't manage to\ninvoke feelings of sympathy in his audience, its\njust that these are due to the pathetic characters\nrather than the accomplished performances. He\nhimself says that some actors have trouble\nadapting from screen to stage and Miranda\nPleasance (a familiar \"The Bill\"/ \"Casualty\" face)\nis an unfortunate victim of this syndrome. Ward\ncan conjure a promising scene, but like\nCroydon's \"fools-wharf\" appearance, he does\nnot produce the feelings, only simple imitations.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 3RD1995. THREE\nAlbert Hall Funding Uncertain\nConfusion\nover \u00a340m Lottery\nPayout\nrenovations\nBY AAARK BRIDGE\nDavid Elliot, the Deputy Chief\nExecutive of the Royal Albert\nHall, has said that there is still no\nsign of whether their application\nfor \u00a340 million pounds of lottery\nfunding had been successful.\nThis follows recent reports\nwhich cast doubt over the success of the Albert Hall's application for Lottery funds to renovate\nthe historic Hall's surrounding\narea.\nIn an interview with Felix\nMr Elliot explained that any\nmoney that 'came their way'\nwould be used to expand the\nnine year programme of 'recon-struct ion and betterment'. This\nplan is in trouble as it is being\ncurrently funded by internal budget surpluses. The stated goals of\nthe ongoing scheme are to\nimprove the atmosphere and\nenjoyment for patrons, perform-ers, and promoters alike.\nPart of the plan involves the\nrestoration of the building's ancient ventilation system to its\noriginal design, which optimised\nnatural convection effects, and\nremoved blockages that were\ninstalled to conform to fire regulations. Permission has also been\nobtained for the rebuilding of a conservatory on the south side of\nthe Hall, re housing restaurants,\ncloakrooms, and other amenities\nthat were moved into the main\nbody of the building when the\noriginal was destroyed earlier this\ncentury.\nPart of the strategy involves\nthe creation of a level under the\nbuilding extending through to\nPrince Consort Road. Access\nwould be via the slip roads either\nside of the main stairway opposite the Royal School of Music.\nThese roads currently lead to\nunderground parking for res i dents.\nThe extra space generated\nby the changes will become a service yard allowing rigging to be\ncarried under the building and\nlifted onto the stage. Further\ndressing room space will also be\ncreated.\nAnother major alteration will\nbe the pedestrian is ation of the\nroad that encircles the Albert\nHall, \"to create something like\nCovent Garden, with cars able to\ngo in and out\". Over 1,600 of the\nHall's seats are scheduled to be\nmodernised, and permission has\nalso been granted for the side\nentrances to be glazed so as to\ncreate more foyer space.\nThe refurbishments have an\nestimated cost of \u00a35 7m. If the\n\u00a340m application to the Lottery\nfund is accepted, the project is\nscheduled to begin within a year.\nThe media may have influenced the application's outcome,\nas they appear to have induced\npolitical controversy over allocation of grants to 'highbrow' arts\nMedia Criticism of\nHeritage Commission\nNational media have extensively\ncovered the heritage commission\ndes ici on, but some of the jou nal ism seems as biased as the claims\nof money mis-distribution itself.\nThe Sunday Times purported\nthat the Albert Hall will be allocated \u00a340m of lottery funds for\nmajor works on the building,\nthough they quoted the Chief\nExecutive as saying he had yet to\nhear of any such decision. This\nappears to be born out by a statement to issued to Hall employees\nsaying \"Despite the story in the\nSunday Times ... subsequently\nrepeated in other newspapers;\nthe Hall has received no indication yet as to whether our application has been successful...\"\nThere were also reports of complaints by Midlands MPs that too\nmuch money had already been\ninvested in the South.\nOn Monday October 23rd The Daily Telegraph wrote of\nhow big charities had a drop of\n14% in donations. The\nIndependent carried a story on\nhow smaller organisations, such\nas one for Eritrean Refugees,\nwere considered for lottery\nmoney. Richard Branson [who\nbid unsuccessfully against\nCamelot] said that the Lottery\nwas being driven by greed that\nmight lead to the same disrepute\nas the 'fat cat' bosses of the privatised utilities.\nWednesday's Times and\nDaily Telegraph explained the\nChurch of England's view that\nthe Lottery \"Exploits the vulnerable and undermines the public\ngood\". Both then pointed out\nthat the Church had made applications for \u00a319m and had already\nreceived Elm. Staying with\nChurch issues on Thursday, The\nDaily Telegraph said the Church\nof Scotland would not be making\nany applications. The British\nMedical Journal reported a17% increase in the number of calls to\nGamblers Anonymous and\nblamed the BBC for over-public-it y. They claimed that right wing\nTories were pressing Kenneth\nClarke to disregard plans to raise\ntaxes on lottery takings.\n\n"

Boat Club\nput the victories of the preceeding months behind them and\nfocused their attention towards\nthe 1995 Henley Royal Regatta\nand Woman's Henley.\nThe woman's crew entered\nthe College Eights event with the\nconfidence of being U AU Champions by a considerable\nmargin. This confidence was not\nmisplaced in the initial rounds in\nwhich they destroyed the Oxford\ncollege crews of St.John's and\nWolfson. However the major\nthreat and eventual defeat cae\nfrom across the Atlantic. The\nmammoth Wisconsin University\nEight was just too fast, in a time\nten seconds quicker than the winners of the next event up.\nIn the college fours event,\nafter coming through to beat\nEdinburgh from being a length\nbehind at halfway, the women\ndid not have the strength in\nreserve to overhaul a strong\nExeter challenge. In club fours,\nthe Imperial crew met the eventual winners in the first round\nand pushed them closer than\nany other team.\nAt the Henley Royal\nRegatta I.C.'s men again\nfronted strong entries in\nmany events, and s pir ted performances were seen in the\nhotly contested Brittania,\nVisitor's, and Temple\nChallenge Cups. However,\nmost of the attention was\ncentred on the con trove rial \"bumping-up\" of the College\nfirst eight from the \"Temple\"\nto the more prestigious\nThames Challenge for Club\nEights.\nThe Temple eight was\nmade up of two previous\nHenley winners and members of the development squad.\nThey started their campaign with\na slightly shaky performance\nagainst.an American college crew\nbut with the steadying influence\nof the previous Club Captain,\nTom Miller and 1994 winner\nJohn Moore on board, the crew\nsucessfully qualified for the next\nday's race against Kingston\nGrammar School.

This boat was stoked by\nMartin Kettle, now an I.C. alumni and a previous twice winner at\nHenley. He and his partner Dave\nGillard, formerly of Cambridge,\nwere clearly in the top two pairs\nat the regatta. However, when\nyou come up against Redgrave\nand Pinsent, presently four\ntimes world champions and\nworld record holders, even an\nI.C. rower could be forgiven\nfor losing. Dave and Martin\nwere knocked out in the\nsemi-finals, where the\nLeander pair slashed thirteen\nseconds off their own course\nrecord.\nThe \"bumped-up\" College\nFirst eight looked to have a tough job on their hands in\nthe higher event, with many\nAmerican entries and some of\nthe faster British crews,\nincluding the Goldie eight\nfrom Cambridge, who had\nmade only one change since\nthe Boat Race. After a confident procession to Saturday they\ndrew the favorites, Goldie. In a race which was described by one\ninternational reporter as \"the\nmost impressive row of the day\"\nthe Imperial boys sped up the\ncourse leaving the Cambridge\nSquad with no answer to finish in\na whipping 6 min 06 sec, taking a full three seconds off the previous record. A difficult win over a good Notts County crew meant a final against the undefeated\nUniversity of Washington Junior\nVarsity. The race was won within\nthe first minute and Imperial\nhammered the point home in\nstyle to win by nearly four\nlengths to gain the club its fifth\nHenley event in four years.\nANY STUDENTS INTERESTED IN\nJOINING I.

    "content": "REAL LIFE FELIX FRIDAY 3RD NOVEMBER 1995 . SEVEN\nA close encounter of\nthe sw M(s) Il@mh in It was a nice, bright\nmorning near the end\nof the Easter Holidays\nin April 1995.\nTwo things crept into my\nmind as I woke up that morning;\nCornflakes and differential equations. The former because I was\nhungry and needed some break-fast, the latter because I couldn't do them and needed to know\nhow to in order to prevent my\nfirst year exams from descending\ninto farce.\nBreakfast and mathematics\nhad been uppermost in my mind\nfor at least the last few mornings,\nbut something else was to happen that same day which was to\nchange my life for the next fifty,\nwell, twenty, no,say ten, well,\nalright, three, days. But the odd\nthing wasn't so much that I felt\nmy life had changed, but the fact\nthat it should have been affected\nat all. Or this life, at any rate...\n\"This is Peter,\" my .mother\nsaid, gesturing to the large, mid-dle-aged genial man who was at\nour breakfast table talking to my\nfather. By this time, I'd decided\nthat cornflakes were a far higher\npriority than differential equations. She ushered me into a chair, adding, \"He's a spiritual-ist.\"\nAn alarm bell in the back of\nmy mind started ringing. For me,\nspiritualism and science went\ntogether nowhere near as well as,\nsay, union ents managers and\nstrange trousers. I was an engineering student. At Imperial\nCollege. I had no time for Russell\nGrant wannabe es peddling pseudoscience. Differential equations\nsuddenly seemed like far more\nreassuring territory. So what did\nI do?\n\"Erm, hello, Peter, how do\nyou do?\" I mumbled cautiously,\nshaking the prof erred hand. I sat\ndown, feeling as though I'd crossed some point of no return\nin etiquette terms. But there was\na way out. I'd have my corn-flakes, exchange a few pleas-an tries, talk about the weather,\ngasp in horror at my watch and\nsay I'd need to do some exam\nrevision, escaping to the comparative freedom of differential\nequations. Easy...\nHe chatted to my parents\nand sister for a while, talking\nabout spirits, e the ric bodies,\nastral projection and the like,\nwhile I crunched through my\ncornflakes. I listened, geni un ely interested. And then I was surprised at being interested. This\nwasn't right. It wasn't what any\nself-respecting engineering pupil\nwould be seen dead doing, talking to a spiritualist, if that's what\nhe was. But the real shock had\nyet to come.\nApparently completely off\nthe cuff, he asked, \"We've met\nbefore, haven't we?\"\n\"Erm, have we?\" it was certainly news to me if we had.\n\"We were both priests in a temple. This wasn'ta few years\nago, or hundreds of years ago,\nwe're talking tens of thousands\nof years ago - \"\nI gaped.\n\" - and,\" he paused dramatically, \"You were just as stubborn\nand irksome then as you are\nnow!\" He laughed.\nI gaped some more. What\ndid he mean, \"stubborn and irk-some\"? More to the point, what\nwas all that about priests and\ntemples and thousands of years?\nI asked him, and he told me. Not\nthis life but another, one of thousands that each one us lived. I was more than just a mere IC\nengineer, though that was what I was now. He told me about eternal souls, about reincarnation,\nabout my aura and the colours\nthat it was showing, that the fact\nthat Buddhists got it right and\neveryone else was wrong, man,\njust wrong.\nBut that was the scary part.\nPeter wasn't talking like some\nwashed-up sixties drug gie. He\nwas terrifyingly ordinary, a man\nwith a family who wouldn't have\nlooked out of place dishing out\nfinancial advice in Barclay's. He\nspoke with a conviction borne of\nexperience, a man who claimed\nthat he'd had the ability to read\naurae - a person's spiritual bar-code, of you like - since the age\nof nine. Either that, or he was\nlying.\nI felt good. I'd found out\nsomething interesting about\nmyself and about life. But then I felt bad about feeling good. I wasn't meant to be interested. I was a man of engineering, a student of the sciences, and profound sce pti c of all things non-scientific. Where were his equations, his graphs, his tables, his\nreferences to papers in Nature\nmagazine? And I began to feel\ngood about feeling bad about\nfeeling good. At last, scientific\nobjectivity and water tightness had prevailed over metaphysical\nwoo lines s. But then I began to\nfeel bad about feeling good about\nfeeling bad about feeling good.\nWas a science-based education\nclosing my mind to concepts that\nscience was too arrogant to\nadmit that it couldn't explain?\nPeter took leave of us later\nthat morning, vanishing out of\nmy life as abruptly as he had\nentered it. Well, this life, at\nleast. I thought that making a joke about seeing him again in\nanother few thousand years\nwould have been a bit tactless, so\nI left it at that.\nHolidays ended, and exams\nloomed. Mad weeks of over-working, under sleeping, under-eating and under shaving ensued.\nExams, a bit of Felix hacker y, and foreign holidays passed by,\nand mornings where I'd get up\nthinking of cornflakes but not,\nmercifully, differential equations. But for a while afterwards,\nI couldn't help viewing people\ndifferently. My family, all my\nfriends, everybody it seemed,\nhad been roaming the planet for\nmillen i a, jumping from life to\nlife, person to person, country to\ncountry, inhabiting one mass of\norganic machinery for a few\nfleeting decades before moving\nonto another, and having no recollection of the previous one.\nI had conversations with a longtime friend of my parents,\nwho really did dish out financial\nadvice in Barclay's, talking about\nthe Theosophical Society, about\nBlavatski, and even Albert\nEinstein, and Richard Feynman.\nMen who were not merely\naccepted by the establishment\nbut had actually come to personify it, yet once their plaudits and\nNobel Prizes had been safely\npocketed they turned some of\ntheir attention to matters of the\nmind, of life, death, birth,\nrebirth. Matters which that same\nestablishment has steered well\nclear of, dismissing it as the\nrealm of cranks and fortune-tellers. Not that it's easily under-stood, though.\nI think I prefer differential\nequations. They're far more\nrespectable.\nAndy Sinharay\n\n"
