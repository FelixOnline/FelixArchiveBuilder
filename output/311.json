On of the things to be discussed is the following late notion accepted\nby tie president, which cones hot off the presses... \"ICU notes with approval the growth and expansion of the ICU Travel Service over the past 3 years. ICU hopes that this expansion will continue and will eventually provide a fully comprehensive programme of travel bookings for individual Union members. To this end ICU calls upon all all commission fees henceforth to be pooled and used solely on expansion\nof tbe Travel Service\" The lowdown on this notion is that the Travel service now needs a part\u2014tine\nassistant during the summer tern, and if the com miss sion fees are pooled, these\nshould just about pay for him. It appears that keen devotee of the ga ne of football, John \"What's Cricket?\" IcC ul lou gb, has turned his attentions to a new sport, that very upper\u2014class\npursuit, CROQUET. The great man is forming a croquet club, Irhich is going to meet\non the Queen's Tower Lawn (at last they' ve a use for it) on suitable days\nto putts nail balls through nearly as s nal1 hoops.

Apparently he\nenjoyed the concerts as\nmuch as the audiences for\nhe has offered to play another concert here free,\nthe proceeds going to\ncharity. Details have not\nbeen settled yet, but the\ndate will probably be Monday, May 15th. If you missed seeing him last time\nround, see him now; those\nwho have seen him once\ndon't need urging to go\nagain\u2014they'll be there.\nFriday, MAY12 th sees\nthe only London appearance of one of America's biggest bands \u2014 THE DOORS. They have not\nbeen seen in this country\nsince the Isle of Wight festival in 1970, since when\nJim Morrison, the lead\nsinger has died. Morrison\nwas the unwilling figurehead of the group; before\nhis death he had virtually\nopted out of the role forced on him. He never\nwanted to be a pop star.\nNow the rest of the band\nare producing their own\nmusical ideas, and the\nsame brilliant playing ensures that few DOORS fans\nwill be disappointed.\nTickets for this concert are\n\u00a31 in advance and \u00a31.20\non the door.\nThe usual Saturday concert on May 13th features\ntwo bands. FLASH are an\nexcellent new band \u2014 this\nis one of their first London\ngigs \u2014 whose music has\nbeen likened to that of\nYES. (Indeed, their lead\nguitarist, Pete Banks, was\nonce with YES). Also appearing is the Roy Young\nBand? \u2014 no pretensions,\njust good stomping rock.\nAdmission: 50p in advance,\n60p on the door.\nSpencer Davis has formed a new band and produced a new album\nrecently. Their debut performance in this country\nwill be in the Great Hall\non May 20th, accompanied\nby Amazing Blondel, who\nnot only play a truly amazing number of instruments,\nbut who also have a reputation for telling obscene\njokes.\nEST, DRINK & DON T FORQET yOUR... REFECTORIES\u2014A DREAM COME TRUE\nThe Rectory Account has 4 components which\nmake up the eventual surplus, balance or loss, namely:\nThe Bar Account\nThe Cellar Account\u2014likely to make the usual \u00a32000\u00a33000 profit this year\nThe Catering Account\nThe Shop Account\u2014likely to break even this year.\nThe Union over the past few years, has very strongly\npressed the point that the 2 main Accounts (Bar and\nCatering) should be considered as separate, i.e. Bar\nprofits should not be used to sub sid is e Refectory\nlosses, but this year no major battle of words looks\nlikely to be fought on this issue as both of these\naccounts look like ending up well in the black.\nBAR PROFITS MEAN 2 NEW BARS\nThe Bar Account had a net surplus of \u00a36000 by January and thus a price decrease was decided upon:\u2014this\nnever happened, because the main breweries increased\ntheir prices by 1p per pint and instead this increase\nwas not passed on. Still, the end of the year surplus\nfigure on the account is likely to be in the region of\n\u00a32000.\nFar from being misers though, the Bar Committee\n(the only major College Committee to have a Student\nChairman \u2014 Pete Earl), besides promising no price\nrises for next year, decided this was a golden opportunity to make some improvements around the place.\nThus, this Summer, 2 major schemes are being under-taken.\nFirstly a new bar in College Block is being built\u2014the\nconnecting wall between the J CR and committee room\n216 is being knocked down and a bar the size of the\nSouthside one is being constructed along the northern\nwall of this new annexe to the JCR.\nSecondly, in the Union, the present very meagre bar\nin the Lower Lounge, which has become very popular\nthis year, is to be re-vamped, extended along the East\nwall (where the Juke Box is) to the doors and properly\nshuttered, so that Brendan doesn't have to carry out\nelaborate stocking and un stocking arrangements every\nnight.\nAND A NEW LOWER REFECTORY\nWhilst talking about Refectory developments, a major\nfacelift is to be given to the Union Lower Refectory.\nIf an application to the University Grants Committee\nfor a loan for redevelopment of the archaic area is\naccepted, then the whole of the present furniture and\nequipment is to be chucked out and a brand new Refectory is to be built from scratch. The Union has an\ninvestigating team preparing ideas at the moment and\nany comments to them via Dave Amos or John\nMcCullough (both to be found in the Union Office) will\nbe welcome.\nIf the UGC application is not successful, then at the\nvery least a new coat of paint and new furniture are\npromised.\nBUT WHAT ABOUT PRICES?\nThe most important annual problem is always prices\nfor next year. Two years ago the Catering account made\na thundering \u00a328,000 loss. Last year it was \u00a33,500 down.\nIn both cases big price increases followed. This year,\nhowever, with increased Conference bookings (which\nhelp to stem losses in the vacations) and increased\nconsumption (was the food better this year?), a possible surplus of about \u00a38,000 is in the offing on a turnover of \u00a3250,000 (\u00a335,000 up on last year). \u00a36,500 of\nthis surplus is already committed to revamping/replace-ment of crockery, cutlery and machinery, and it is hoped\nthat, starting with this amount this year, a fund can be\nkept on an annual basis to help pay for capital equipment expenditure, etc. Any surplus on top of this fund\nmoney (maybe \u00a31,500 this year?) will go towards another pool, as contingency money to offset any future\nlosses.\nIT'S A NATURAL ONLY\n\u00a31.75\nInc.

Both travel and insurance operate in the\nvicinity of Committee Room 216, at the East End of the Junior Common Room\nin College Block.\nThe Travel Service operates 2 lunch-times a week at present inside 216, Tuesdays and Thursdays 1.00-2.00. But with heavy business likely in the Summer\nTerm, watch out for notices \u2014 the time-table may expand. Pete Guthrie is your\nTravel Officer this year and can be contacted for emergencies in Linstead Hall.\nGeoff Tate is one of his assistants and Geoff will be taking over next year. Business\nconsists of giving out international Student Identity Cards and selling flights to\nEurope, N. Africa and the Near East, and trains also to those destinations. Ship\ntravel and travel to N. America, Asia, Australia etc. is provided for by way of information of the best place and way to fix up your trip. Bon Voyage!\nThe Endsleigh Insurance Service operates 5 lunchtimes a week (from about\n12.30-2.30) either in 216 or just next to it in the J CR. Motor, Travel and Life Insurance are 3 of the most popular services, but this is by no means a full list.

He was committed to Inner\nLondon Sessions.\nMcCarthy family wrote to the Governor of Wormwood Scrubs to enquire about\nStephen's condition as they were very worried.\nMcCarthy family wrote to \"The Sun\". The reply was that there was little chance\nof success in a complaint as Stephen was a borst al boy.\nProbation officer expressed concern at Stephen's condition.\nReply from Assistant-Governor of Wormwood Scrubs that Stephen was \"fit and\ncheerful\".\nMcCarthy family received notification that Stephen had arrived at Dover Borstal\non 8th December.\nMcCarthy family wrote to the Daily Express, who, in their reply, advised them to\ncontact the N. C.C.L. The N. C.C.L. were sympathetic, but, so far, have made no\nimpact on the authorities.\nMcCarthy family visited Stephen at Dover. He was still not at all well, though\nthe doctor said that he was much improved..\n25 November\n10 December\n1970\nFebruary\nApril\nMid-October\n16 November\n24 December\n25 November\n26 November\n7 December\n8 December\n11 December\n12 December\n20 December\n1971\n10 January\n14 January\n15 January\n16 January\n22 January\n26 January\n29 January\n2 February\n3 February\n19 February\n25 February\n15 March\n20 March\nMay\n3 July\n24 July\nAugust\nSeptember\n8 & 9 October\n28 October\n\"Who Killed\nStephen's sister and her boy-friend visited him and found his condition was very\npoor indeed.\nStephen failed to appear at Inner London Sessions because of illness.\nTelephone call from Governor of Dover that Stephen had been admitted to\nFolkestone Hospital with a suspected mastoid.\nStephen transferred to Brook Hospital, Woolwich, a neurology hospital. Immediately on his arrival, he was taken to the operating theatre. His family was told\nthat, the following day, he would be feeling much better. Later that night they\nreceived an urgent message to return at once as Stephen had taken a turn for\nthe worse. Letter written to Home Office.\nMcCarthys made official complaint to Scotland Yard. Three police appeared at\nBrook Hospital, where Stephen was in a coma. They demanded to see witnesses.\nNewspapers, who enquired at Scotland Yard both on 22nd and 23rd of January,\nwere told that no complaint had been made.\nStephen died.\nInquest opened and adjourned until 19th February.\nThe newspapers finally took up the story.\nStephen's funeral, filmed by '24 Hours'.\nInquest.

They were blackmailed by their lawyers into keeping quiet.\nStephen McCarthy?\" is a small booklet price 10p from:\nThe McCarthy Committee,\n50 Courteney Court,\nHolloway,\nLondon N7.\nCROSS ROADS\nOne does not have to be particularly committed to the ideas and ideals of the\nMoral ReArmament movement to have an interest in the life of its founder, Frank\nBuchman. Any man who had such an influence over so many people deserves\nattention.\nThus comes \"Cross Road\u2014The Frank Buchman Story\" to the stage of the Westminster Theatre. The play is presented in a cunning Mixed-Media form, with\naction on stage interspersing sequences of still slides and live film. We are led from\nBuchman's small town origins in Pennsylvania, through his work in six continents,\nto his death in Germany in 1961. The young cast, eight of them from five con-tin ents, sing and talk of their own lives and experiences, as well as of Buchman\nand his ideology. The effect is often almost that of watching a Television document-ary, and that is my main criticism of this production\u2014as a play\u2014there is insufficient action on stage to balance the enormous amount of (excellent) projected\nmaterial.\nBut to criticize an M.R. A. play in conventional terms is like discarding the\nSpecial Theory because of Einstein's shocking handwriting. It is the matter, and\nnot the form, that is important. Some of the acting is pretty awful, but, oddly enough,\nthis enhances the production, for it shows the absolute honesty of the cast, and\ntheir belief in what they are saying. They are really not acting at all. Cynics may\nsneer, but there is a genuineness here that is refreshing.\nTHE DOORS \"OTHER VOICES\" (Elektra)\nQuestion: Why do so many Rock and Roll stars die? Answer: Because there are\nso many Rock and Roll stars. There seems to be in people's minds a fundamental but imaginary difference between a musician leaving a group and carrying\non elsewhere, and a musician leaving the group to join the Grateful Dead (sorry).\nIn fact Canned Heat managed very well after the death of Alan Wilson (ask everyone who saw them at the Albert Hall last year, except of course the Melody Maker\ncorrespondent) and the Allman Brothers still boogie on with that macabre name\ndespite the death in October of Duane Allman. But wasn't Jim Morrison the only\nmember of the Doors\u2014most people had only heard of him either when he whipped it out on stage at Miami, or when he died and was buried at Pere Lachaise\ncemetery in trendy Paris \u2014 near the grave of Moliere. Woudn't the names of\nRobbie Krieger, John Densmore and Ray Manzarek have been forgotten if the\nrest of the group had decided to call it a day?\nNo. Jim Morrison was\nonly a quarter of the Doors\nwith a flair for poetry, a love of the Blues and a sexy voice. The songs on\nthe early Doors albums\nwere always given joint\ncredits so people may not\nrealise that some of the\ngroups' more familiar numbers \u2014 \"Light My Fire\",\n\"Touch Me\", \"When the\nMusic's over\" (We want\nthe world and we want it\nnow!) were written by Robbie Krieger. And don't the\norgan and guitar solos on\n\"Light My Fire\" send a shiver down your spine?\nOf course Morrison gave\nthose songs a charisma\nwhich will not be imitated\n\u2014don't expect the group\nto play them this Friday\u2014\nbut the faith in their ability\nto write more good songs,\nand in the record buying\npublic to remember that\nability (alas, not fulfilled\u2014\nthe record did not make\nthe top thirty in the States,\nDISCS\nalthough it scored quite\nwell over here) must have\nbeen what decided the\nthree to stay together. In\nfact the Doors had almost\nbroken up before Morrison's death and would\ncertainly not be playing at\nImperial College tomorrow\nif he were still alive.\nNow to \"Other Voices\".\nIt could be summed up as\na fairly logical progression\nfrom \"L.A. Woman\" but\nwith Robbie and Ray doing the singing. As such it\nis not outstanding, falling\nshort of the classic first\nalbum or \"Strange Days\"\nbut I'm enjoying it more\nthan I did \"Waiting for the\nSun\" or \"Morrison Hotel\".\nHappily the two vocalists\ndo not make strenuous\nattempts to sound like Jim\nMorrison. Ray, whose\nvocal debut on record was\n\"Close to You\" on the\n\"Absolutely Live\" album,\nsounds more at home on\nthe funky (yuk) rocking\nnumbers like \"Hang on to\nYour Life\" and the incredible \"Tightrope Ride\" than\non the softer numbers like\n\"Ships with Sails\" where\na shadow seems to creep\nover the music (guess\nwhose) notwithstanding\nthe fact that \"Ships\"\nevokes an atmosphere\nsimilar to \"Riders on the\nStorm\". In the unhappy\n\"I'm Horny. I'm Stoned\"\nRobbie shows his vocal\ntalents too. Nice bit of\nsaloon bar piano on this\none.\nI'm sure all Doors\nfreaks already have this\nalbum. If you doubt its\nquality, or think you don't like it, try to forget it's the\nDoors and think \"This is a funky little band\". Failing\nthat, try to imagine Jim\nsinging these songs (it's not difficult) and ponder\nover what little difference\nit makes. And try to see\nthem live.\nYOU'D BE SURPRISED\nWHO USES THE\nI.C.

One who has been subjected to an academically biased and intellectually very narrow course\nof study since the age of fifteen, at which time that vital\ndecision was unlikely to have been entirely his own.\nIn general he has had no reason to question the nature\nor direction of his education, or the way in which that\neducation affects his non-academic development. His\nscrutiny of University options would probably have been\nfar from critical and his final choice of Imperial College\nwould undoubtedly have been based on its reputation,\nwhich in the eyes of most headmasters serves to nullify\nany possible disadvantages.\nWhat are the disadvantages? They lie mainly in\nthe failure of the College\nto either recognize or accept its responsibility to\nstudents as individuals.\nThe sort of person who\nfinds his way into I.C. is\njust the person who needs\nmore from a university\neducation that a narrow\ncourse of study, with a very high work load, in an\nenvironment that is socially inadequate and intellectually uninspiring, and\nin an atmosphere that is\npotentially extremely op-press ive. On arriving at Imperial\nCollege the fresher finds\nhimself part of a very small\nsocial group, a member of\nhis year of his department,\npart of system that is so\nstructured that there is a minimal amount of contact\nwith other groups. Barriers\nexist between depart-ment s, between years\nwithin departments, between undergraduates and\npostgraduates, and between staff and students.\nEven within the confines\nof the College and its already narrow influence the\nindividual is still further\nisolated from any diversity\nof stimulation, intellectual\nor otherwise.\nThe College will argue\nthat it is up to the initiative of each individual student to pursue such alternative activities as he may\ndesire in the friendly, you-can - get - it - if - you-really-want-it community that is\nCentral London. Can they\nbe so naive? Do they really\nimagine that someone\nwho has to commute daily\nfrom his beds it in Wimbledon, and who knows no\nbetter from school than to\ngo home and do his\n'homework' in the even-in gs, wil go out into the big\ncity in search of cultural\nor intellectual ful fl ment? The average I.C. student\nin that position is too concerned with trying to sort\nhimself out a passable\nsocial life to even think\nabout it.\nThe College insists that\nplacing the burden on the\nindividual is all part of the\n'challenge' of university\nlife, vital to a process of\ncharacter building and essential in producing the\nsort of good moral fibre\nthat industry demands of\nits young employees. It\nassumes that secondary\neducation has been successful in producing an\nannual supply of eight hundred well balanced individuals who are both intellectually and socially accomplished and have\ncome to the College committed to three years hard\nwork towards a well\nchosen and well defined\ngoal, and consequently\nwill neither need nor ask\nmore of the college than\naccess to its specialised\nteaching and research\nfacilities and a successful\npassage through its examination machinery. That is\nthe only sort of student\nthat I.C. really caters for,\nand if the College truly believes that the majority of\nits students represent such\nideal material for their\nconcept of a university\neducation (or is it just an\nindustrial training ground?) then they must\nbe shown otherwise. Any\nindividual has the right to\nan education that caters\nfor his own needs and not\njust the needs of external\nindustrial interests. That is\na right which can and must\nbe exercised.\nChris Sheppard\nKIBBUTZ\nWhat's it all about. Stay with\nus for a month or more as a working visitor and discover\nfor yourself.

In recent years \"Icky\" has visited France, The Channel\nand Scilly Islands, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Denmark and Sweden, as well as many pub-to-pub weekend\ncruises around the coast.\nThis year started well for \"Icky\" with a splendid winter refit and consequently she is sailing very well in-deed. Over the Easter vac. she was chartered for 4\nweekly cruises, and visited Belgium, France and the\nChannel Islands.\nFrom the 9th \u201416th April, Peter Banbury, Tony Atkins, and Sandy Ealing sailed from Dover to the\nHamble, and although storm bound for a couple of days\nmanaged some very fast sailing in a Force 6, along the\nsouth coast. Over the next eight days, Icky was sailed\nby Peter Banbury, Malcolm McVean, Bob CranmerBrown, Dave Hobman and brave Christine Fisher. The\n126 mile trip from the Isle of Wight to Guernsey in a brisk NE wind took 24 hours, and on arrival we were\nall entertained very well at the Royal Channel Islands\nYacht Club, where lager was cheap at 7\u00a3p and the\nshowers unbelievably welcome. From St. Peterport in\nGuernsey we sailed to St. Malo in a record 9 hrs., averaging 6.4 knots in a Force 5\u20147, with some dramatic\nnavigation through a200 yard wide channel in the\nrocks, at the entrance to St. Malo harbour. The return\ntrip to Guernsey against the wind took a hard 18 hours\nand from 3\u20145.00 a.m. saw some brave sail changing\non a plunging fore deck by a wet and exhausted crew.\nEventually we left Icky in Guernsey, having heard a series of Gale Force warnings from the NE\u2014for those\nworried about it, \"Icky\" has weathered several Force 8\nGales, but it's just not possible to sail to windward in\na Gale!\nOver the summer, there will be a number of sailing\nweekends, and several cruises lasting from one to five\nweeks\u2014the latter as a charter to Spain and back! At\n\u00a340 per week for 5 people, this is a very cheap way to\nspend an exciting holiday. If you'd like to come along\nfor a weekend or a week, contact Bob Cranmer-Brown,\nChem. Eng. P.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX Thursday, May 11th,1972 CONFERENCE\nAT THE\nCROSSROADS\nThis year's Birmingham Conference of the National\nUnion of Students will be remembered in NUS history\nas the conference of the LCDSU\u2014the \"Liaison Committee for the Defence of Student Unions.\" The Liaison\nCommittee say that they were formed firstly to \"win the\nNUS to its policy on the question of Student Union\nAutonomy and secondly to draw together all those\nunions and groups of militants in the ongoing fight\nagainst the state's attack in education and the other\ncentral political issues of the day.\" They formed up at\nthe November Margate conference, Piers Corbyn being a founder member. This Birmingham conference\nmay yet turn out to be the first of a series of such\nLCDSU-dominated conferences. It is to be hoped that\nthey will not do further irreparable damage to the reputation of the NUS.\nThe LCDSU succeeded not\nonly in pressing their point with\ngreat forcefulness, but also\nproved to delegates, onlookers,\nreaders of the popular dailies\nand the tax-paying public alike\nthat NUS conferences can be\nthe biggest farce around\u2014one\nday Lew Grade will televise it\nas a never-ending, self-perpetuating series. For that's just what\nit is. I know that this is only my\nsecond conference, but as I once again witnessed the resurrection of Autonomy and Ulster\nand the birth of Women's Lib\nas a new topic for the book, I felt as though I had been sitting\nin that conference hall all my\nlife.\nPerhaps the most intriguing\nthing to a layman and non-par-tic i pant like myself is the seriousness with which the proceedings are taken by the de le gates, even (or perhaps I should say especially) by the\nmembers of the LCDSU. I firmly\nbelieve, unlike some of my\nstudent press colleagues, that\nthe organisers of this faction\nhave only the good of Student\nUnions in their minds, and had\nno intention of directly making\na laughing-stock of conference.\nAs I saw a Liaison Committee\nmember get up to every motion\nand propose an amendment expressing their basic principles,\nthese manifestly being that\neverything that's wrong with the\nworld is the product of Imperialism, Capitalism, Toryism, and,\nmore generally, Ted Heath, I realised suddenly \"God! They\nreally do expect conference to\ntake them seriously!\" . . . though\nI did find it very difficult to\nconceive that if one overthrew\ncapitalism pollution and overpopulation would be instantly\ncured, which is what they seemed to be implying at one stage.\nTheir beliefs are quite possibly\ncorrect\u2014but, having heard them\nchurn up the same argument\nfor the same amendment to\nevery single motion that came\nup before conference over those\nfive long days, one sym pathis es with conference for being\ndisillusioned and defeating them\nevery time. At one stage I felt\nlike dashing out and joining the\nConsevative Party. (You'll probably be pleased to hear that,\non reflection, sense prevailed\nand I didn't). And now, having bored you\nstiff with my personal views on\nconference, and before launching into a mammoth resume of\nwhat really happened motions-wise (yes, the TRUE unexpurgated facts as only FELIX can\ntell them!!) you will be treated\nto a brief bit of chit-chat about\nthe IC delegation and weather.\nThe latter, which is really\nwhat you wanted to know about\nanyway, was pretty terrible (NO,\nI'm talking about the weather,\nnot the IC delegation!!!). Come\nto think of it, it was pretty terrible at Margate last November\ntoo. Must be something about\nthe weather in the constitution\n(GET ON WITH IT!!\u2014we didn't pay for you to go so that you\ncould write 2,000 words on the\nweather\u2014Ed). The Imperial\ndelegation consisted of John\nMcCullough, Dave Hobman, Rob\nArmitage, Chris Sheppard, Piers\nCorbyn and Pete Ransome. If it\nstrikes you that the last two were\nthe two NOT to be elected to\ngo, you'd be right . . . . but\nDave Amos and John Murlis had\nto drop out at short notice, and\nso Piers and Pete agreed to\ncome with observer status. And\nso the intrepid six, together\nwith passengers, duplicator, 30\nreams of paper, 'n suitcases and\nyours truly, your very own pet\n(Miaaooouuu!) reporter, crowded into the RCC Transit at 1100\nhrs. on Monday, 10th April and\nproceeded at breakneck speed\nup the Edgware Road and\nthence up the M1 to beautiful\nBirmingham. Then, feeling suitably elevated by a70 minute\nwait in the registration queue\nand having moved my luggage\nhalf a mile on foot to another\nhall of residence and subsequently discovered that the\nwalk from the conference hall\nto the hall of residence where\ni was staying was in the region\nof a mile or more (needless to\nsay, with their delicate constitutions, the delegation travelled the distance by van), I enthusiastically entered the conference hall in anticipation of\nTurn left,\n\u2022\nleft, then\nleft again\nanother thrilling opening speech\nfrom who is without doubt the\nworst speaker in conference\u2014\nour press y himself, the Rt.\nDishon. Digby Jacks.\nBut now to serious matters:\ni.e., the motions that were variously passed and defeated (or\nat least the important ones):\u2014\nAUTONOMY was by far the\nlongest debate, lasting for a good eight hours in toto, in bits\nand pieces between 9 a.m. and\n1 a.m. the following morning.\nSurprisingly perhaps to those\nuninitiated in conference, little\nif anything new was raised, and\nthe majority of the time was\nspent counting and recounting\nthe four or five card votes that\nwere demanded by the LCDSU.\n(For those who do not know, a card vote is one where the total\nstrength of the constituent\nunions are counted as votes in\na secret ballot\u2014usually motions\nare passed on a show of de le gates' cards. The Card Vote\nprinciple tends to favour the\nlarge colleges, invariably universities and poly s; this is because\nof the system of allocation of\ndelegates' cards to small col-leg es). IC (John McC) spoke\non this motion censuring those\nCO's who had not yet coughed\nup the 1p levy, let alone the 2p one, levied by last November's conference and the emergency\nconference in January.\nWOMEN IN SOCIETY was\nwithout doubt the most interesting motion passed, and perhaps\nthe most important. Besides outlawing strip shows in Student\nUnions (which was, naturally,\nall the popular dailies reported)\nthe motion more generally supported women's right to equal\nopportunity and pay, equality in\neducation, coed schools, more\nsex education, free cont race p tion, and the abolition of single-sex colleges. Dave Hobman,\nfamed liberator of the Union\nBar, spoke on behalf of IC for\nthis motion.\nENVIRONMENT. Conference\naccepted that the world was now\nin a most dangerous situation\nbecause of pollution and over-population, and called for a reduction in the former and free\ncontraception to help combat\nthe latter. An interesting\namendment tabled by the executive was that all smoking in\npublic places should be banned.\nHaving passed this by an overwhelming majority, conference\nproceeded to totally ignore it\nand continued to smoke pro-fuse ly. Nor have I noticed ICU\ntaking any action on this most\nthoughtful and sensible amendment by banning smoking in the\nUnion Building, etc. (Now you\nknow that I'm a non-smoker!!).\nIt is making a mockery of conference if CO's take no notice\nof the motions they themselves\nhave passed.\nJAMES. Conference totally rejected the James Report on\nfurther education as a \"total\nhot ch pot ch of ideas\" which\nwould result in \"an elitist system of Higher Education with an\ninferior Teacher Training sec-tor\". Conference called for an\nend to the binary system of\nfinancing of further education. It\nalso called for a \"Day of\nAction\" to protest about James,\nBinary, and the government's attitude to Autonomy.\nGRANTS. The Imperial-supported amendment extolling the\nvirtues of and pressing for a 'Student Wage\", to be paid to\nall students for the duration of\nthe academic year and without\nparental contribution, upon which\nincome students would pay income Tax and Social Security\npayments was passed by a large\nmajority. The motion also called\nfor equal \"wages\" to be paid to\nall students irrespective of sex\nor the sector of higher ed they\nare in.\nCONFERENCE REFORM (My\nGod, does it need it!!). After\nmiscellaneous suggestions, including one that instead of two\nconferences a year we have one\n8-day one (it was then pointed\nout that not everybody was that\nsuicidal ly inclined), Conference\nset up a working party to look\ninto the whole set-up. Amongst\nthings they will look into will be\nthe election of ail delegates by\nunion meetings (like the ICU\nsystem, in fact, is at present. . .\nmany other colleges' delegations\nconsists of volunteers or co-opted members, and no election\nis held), which would probably\nmean that the LCDSU and any\nother similar organisation that\nmight set up would receive less\nsupport, and that Conference\nwould become more moderate;\nthey will also consider the\nnecessity for the mandate ment of delegations by their unions\non important topics prior to conference (which would weaken\nsplinter groups still further) and\nmethods of saving conference's time (very welcome, in view of\nthe time spent on points of\norder and information and in\ndragging up every sub-sub-para-graph of the cons it uti on in every\nmotion.).\nF.E. COLLEGES. This motion\nrecognised that many FE colleges have no facilities what-so ever, and that the others have\nvery little. The exec was censured for their lack of leadership\nover the binary campaign, and a move to establish a fund for FE\ncollege unions was referred to\nthe Finance Committee for its\nconsideration.\nEMERGENCY MOTIONS concerned the campus problems of\nseveral CO's. A motion on Lancaster supported the students\nthere on their action over the\ndismissal of Dr. Craig; another\nsupported the students of\nMagee College in Londonderry,\nwhich is threatened with clo-sure; and yet another expressed\nconference's support for Steve\nParry, expelled sabbatical president of Brighton College (he has\nsince been reinstated).\nENTERTAINMENTS. A report\nproposing an NUS limited liability ents brokerage was adopted by a large majority. This will\nentail CO's buying shares in\nthis company and, perhaps,\nhaving a bit of a rough time\nents-wise for at least several\nmonths. The idea is that this\nbrokerage will be able to book\ngroups at a lower price than individual colleges are having to\npay at the moment. However, it\nseems likely that the big agencies to whom all the artists are\nsigned will boycott this broker-age, and thus their groups will\nnot appear at colleges.\nBut the NUS, in its infinite\nwisdom, thinks that this situation\nwill change, in that they depend\nso much on the college circuit\nthat eventually they'll give in and\nagree to book groups to us for\na reduced fee. Whether this will\nwork or not remains to be seen\n. . . . on condition that you yourselves boycott visits to see\ngroups perform at other venues\nthan colleges, it might just\nwork . . .\nELECTIONS is the only thing\nleft to tell you about. During the\nfirst two days of conference, the\nexecutive for next year was\nelected, or, should I say, re-elected, since it remains virtually unchanged. Almost every\nelection was a straight fight between a retiring exec member\nand a candidate put up by the\nLCDSU . . . so the \"Telegraph\"\nhad to swallow its pride and\nsocialist tendencies and declare\nits relief that a Communist had\nwon the election to President of\nNUS against a Marxist-Trotskyist ultra-left-winger. Needless to\nsay, the LCDSU lost every ele c tion, although they consistently\npolled a third of all the votes,\nand in some cases rather more.\nSo Digby Jacks is president for\nanother year. And the rest of the\nold regime will continue. At any\nrate, for another year. And,\nhaving elected their chosen\nexecutive, conference will proceed to censure them whenever possible at next year's November and April confer-en ces. When, once again, the\nfarce will recommence.\nWei, are you still with me?\nYou're probably the only one!\nI'd like to apologise for the\nvery heavy political content of\nthis article: although I'm no\npolitician, since there was no\ndoubt that the political element\nwas the most important single\ntheme of the conference, I felt\nit necessary to elaborate on it.\nWhat has the conference\nachieved? Well, let's hope that\nthe Constituent Organisations\nwill act upon the motions, the\nExecutive will honour their in-struct ions, and that the authorities will consider fully the views\nof Conference. Then, perhaps,\nconference will achieve far more\nthan might at first appear.\nRanee for\nonly \u00a32.25?\nGet hovered!\nGreat hovering Hoverlloyd is the\ncheapest, most exciting way to go\nall Continental.

EXAMS\nAfter the dizzy heights of the recent elections and sweeping generalisations characteristic of them we are suddenly reminded that even\nthe president of the Union has to pass exams!\nIn fact, it has become\napparent that the college\nauthorities had not thought\nof this either and so we\nare (or rather Chris Sheppard is) faced with an\ninteresting situation. The\nUnion constitution is more\nthan vague over this point.\nThis is hardly surprising\nsince there have only been\nthree sabbatical presidents\nup to date, none of these\nbeing undergraduates at\ntheir time of office.\nThe problem has been\nlurking around for quite\nsome time and now we\nhave come face to face\nwith it.

Saturday, 6th May\nDear Professor Skempton,\nAfter a considerable amount\nof thought regarding my present\nsituation in the Civil Engineering\nDepartment I have decided to\nwithdraw from the forthcoming\nexaminations. This has not been\nan easy decision to make but I am now sure that it is the only\nsatisfactory one. In reaching it\nI have tried to take into account as many of the influencing factors, both personal and\notherwise, as I am able. I do,\nhowever, find it impossible to\nrational is e some of these factors\nand it is this that has made the\nfinal decision so difficult to\nmake.\nMy original choice of civil engineering was made without any\ndifficulty at the age of fifteen.\nBy that time I had shown some\naptitude for things practical; my\nsomewhat greater ability at\nscience and mathematics had\nbeen fostered at the expense of\nany literary interest, and my\nteachers explained in their reports that I exhibited a certain\nquality ot \"leadership\". The\nsimple analysis of civil engineering as a blend of technological and creative ability, together with its social relevance,\nand, when concerned with con-tr acting, its reliance on good\nhuman relations, altogether presented a too ideally attractive\nproposition. My decision was not\nreached by an appraisal of a selection of alternatives, but by\nbeing provided with someone\nelse's evaluation of my vocational potential, together with the\ncorresponding and suitably attractive career choice.\nOn arriving at college and\nentering the Department I was\nstill very much subject to the\nsomewhat romantic idea of becoming a civil engineer. My\ncommitment in emotional terms\nwas almost complete, and this\ntogether with my good A levels\nconstituted what I suppose was\nexcellent honours degree mater-i al.I was however, conscious of\nthe idealism inherent in my\nchoice and was very concerned\nwith finding some justification\nfor it in the course. Thus I began my time here at I.C. deliberately looking for a correlation\nbetween what I was studying,\nthe way I was studying it, and\nwhat I perceived as the aims,\nobjects and responsibilities of\ncivil engineering as apr of es sion. In that search I was frustrated. I was disillusioned by\nthe seemingly abstract course\ncontent, by the lack of thematic continuity, and by the impersonal nature of staff/student\nrelations. I was also disappointed by the Jack ot community life\nat the College and by its general insularity in both social and\nacademic terms.\nThe result of this dissatisfaction was for me to make the\nCollege as small a part of my\nlife as possible, doing an absolute minimum of work, and seeking elsewhere those things which\nI had previously imagined to be\nan integral part of university\nlife but which I was unable to\nfind at I.C. My decision to return into the\nsecond year was based on the\ncondition that I would assume\na quite different approach to the\nCollege, the Department and the\nCourse. That I have done. From\nthe start of the session I have\nattempted to investigate many\naspects of the student's lot here\nat I.C. Where I have found anomalies or def ici en ces, points\nof difference or a lack of under-standing, I have attempted to\nwork constructively, both per-s iii i.4k son ally and through my involvement in the Union, to correct\nthem. This has applied particularly to my course where I first\nattempted to discover some intrinsic interest, and then to\nap poach it purely as an intellectual exercise. I failed in both.\nI have come to realise that\nthe course here is doing nothing\nto further my development in\nany sense of the word. On the\ncontrary it is, in many respects,\nconflicting directly with some of\nmy most deeply felt ideals and\naspirations, and far from stimulating any truly creative res-pons e, is only limiting my realm\nof experience to the detriment\nof my \"education\".\nI am firmly committed to the\nconcept of a system of education that can be variable in content and approach, and which\nis not constrained by the inadequacies of selection, by the rigid\ndivision of disciplines, or by the\nemphasis on examination results\nas a criterion of success. I am,\ntherefore, the product of a vastly different system of education whose values have been\npredominate in my upbringing\nand the et lects of which, although I may be conscious of,\nI am unable to neglect. To\nweigh my desire for self-deter-mi nation against an awareness\nof the aspirations of a family\nI love is indeed a difficult thing\nto do.\nMy final decision to withdraw\nfrom the examinations results, I hope, from a certain degree of\nmutual respect between myself\nand the department. It has never\nbeen denied that the Department\nis happiest with students who\nare completely committed to a career in civil engineering, and\nwho in return for a degree of\nthe indisputable repute which\nthe College awards, are prepared to accept the way in which\nthe Department chooses to conduct its affairs, whether they\nare likeable or not. The Department also hopes that its stud-ents, far from regarding the\ncourse as a means to an end,\nare attempting to grasp a real\nunderstanding ot the subject\nand are prepared to subordinate themselves to that aim. In\nshort, the staff of the department expect of the students a devotion to the subject of the\nsort they themselves feel. That\nis an expectation which I re-spec t. It remains, however, that I do\nnot present such ideal material,\na fact which both the Department and I have been aware of\nfor some time. For me to sit the\nforthcoming examinations would\ndo nothing to enhance my principles nor, I believe, those of\nthe Department. I now feel that\nthe best way to realise a mutual\nacceptance of my total in com pet ability with the course is tor me\nto withdraw from that part which\nformally epi to mises it.\nThe reason for me public ising my intention to withdraw from\nthe examinations is because of\nthe way in which it relates to my\nbeing President-elect of the Union. While I regard both the criteria and the results of an\nexamination in civil engineering\nas distinctly separate from those\nfor the election of President of\nthe Union, I do realize that neither the College or the Union is\nclear about this in terms of pol-icy. For that reason I intend\nfirstly to put the question to a Union meeting and if their support is forthcoming to proceed\nto the College for their decision.\nIn the event of the Union not\nwishing to support me I shall\nresign.\nYours sincerely,\nChris Sheppard.\nMIXING BEIT\nHALL A questionnaire has\nbeen sent round to the\nresidents of Beit to find\nout their reactions to a possible room-by-room mixing\nof the sexes both in the\nOld and New hostels. The\nmixing would be engineered to have about half men\nand half women on any\nfloor, mixed randomly. The\nbath and toilet areas would\nbe open to use for both\nsexes.\nThis would, we feel, lead\nto better mixing of the\nsexes and bring the sexual differences into per-spec ti ve. People at the\nmoment see the opposite\nsex too much as sexual\nobjects, and not enough\nas human beings first and\nforemost. The only kind of\nrelationship with the opposite sex that is possible,\nthey imagine, is a sexual\none \u2014 the idea of a platonic relationship does not\noccur. Thus one would get\na more balanced, mature\noutlook on both sides, and\na generally more relaxed\natmosphere.\nThe mixing of the bath\nand toilet areas is primarily a matter of convenience\n\u2014any embarrassment felt\nat first would quickly dis-appear.\nSome structural alterations would have to be\nbe made but these were in\nthe pipeline anyway: e.g. shower doors, not curtains;\nimprovement of kitchen\nfacilities in Old Beit, etc.\nThe analysis of the questionnaire will be put before\nthe Beit hall residents'\ncommittee on May 22nd and they will decide whether to implement the suggested system, which if\nthey agree, could easily be\nin operation for October\n1972.\n\n"

Undoubtedly next year will see a Union free from communication wrangles, a union where participation and involvement become the rule rather\nthan the exception.\nELECTIONS (or if at first you don't succeed)\nI cannot help but comment on the situation\nwhereby one person was able to successfully\nchallenge the election of Honorary Secretary\nand force the union quite rightly into re-open-ing and re-holding of that election. It was\nobvious to every member of the executive that\nthe Imperial College constitution was pathetically weak and it is with regret that there has\nnever been time enough for John McCullough's constitutional changes to be discussed. I don't know whether to treat the uncontested re-ele c tion with grateful thanks to the three defeated\ncandidates who stood down or with disappointment because they had not fought on! One thing\nis certain, the road has been opened to anyone\nwhether they are merely seeking justice or\nwhether they only seek trouble and confusion,\nto bring the union to a halt.\nACCOMMODATION\nFinally I think we must be grateful that this\nyear has not seen the situation whereby hundreds of IC students have been homeless. I feel\nthat now is the time for consolidation in housing\nrather than advancement. A start was made in\nOctober when twenty-four women were moved\ninto Selkirk\u2014now they must be integrated\nwith the rest of the residents, not isolated at the\ntop of staircase 8.\nBeit Hall too, should scatter it's women's rooms amongst the men's and hopefully try and\nattain an atmosphere of understanding between the sexes. The union has its part to play,\nand could start well by reducing the number of\nUnion Officials' places thus allowing more ordinary IC students the opportunity of at least\none year's residence.\nFelix, 11th May\nThis edition of FELIX was edited by David\nHobman with able and generous assistance\nfrom ex-Editor Dave Sugden, Business manager\n(turned journalist) John B. Stares, Ross\nMcBeath and Editor-elect Oily Dowson. Bob\nCranmer-Brown and Denise Lisenden thought of\nthe features while the reviews were produced\nby Bob Carter and Syd Amor. Photographs\n(nudge, nudge) were taken, developed and\nprinted by Colin McCall, while the Sports Page\nwas Chris Potter's baby. Typing by multi various young ladies.\nAdvertising Agents are University Press Representation, Grand Buildings, Trafalgar Sq.,\nLondon WC2 (next time get more).\nFelix is printed with painstaking care by F. Bailey and Son Ltd., Dursley, Gloucestershire,\nand is published by the Editor (is it?) on behalf\nof ICU Publications Board, London SW7 2BB, tel. 01-589-2963 (int. 2881) (ask for Lulu).\nRenders Comments\nBlack Thoughts\nDear Sir,\nI would like to bring to the attention of your readers\nthe forthcoming election for the Sabbatical position of\nHon. Secretary of IC Union; this election is equally important as the previous, aborted attempt and, as such,\nI hope that Union members will spare a little of their\nvaluable time to ensure that the democratic process\nprevails over the bureaucratic. (bureaucrat, (by oo 'rok'-kr at) n. Official who works (?) according to a fixed\nroutine without exercising intelligent').\nThe STV system as used by IC Union is nothing more\nthan a sophisticated form of constitutional castration.\nIt is a sad and sorry indictment of our Union that the\nnegligent transactions, or perhaps the administrative\nincompetence of a few can thwart the will of the major-it y.I sincerely hope that the Union Members will feel\nmoved to mandate me to extricate the executive, and\nthe Union, from its aimless perfunctory writings.\nMy aim is to revitalize the enthusiasm of the average\nunion member,\u2014a goal which can only be achieved by\na person who is both approachable and informative;\nsomebody who union members can meet for a chat, who\nwill fully account the executives' action through the\nmedia of a weekly Felix and prominently placed notice\nboards.\nUnion General Meetings have sunk into a morass of\npetty bureaucracy; many union members with constructive ideas to contribute at meetings are befuddled by the\nprocedural techniques used by both chairmen to railroad official motions through, and by factions who have\na bare-faced disregard for the feelings of the muffled\nmajority. These monstrous political methods born out\nof dishonour and deceit, are an in f ring ment of one's dis-cus sion. The Union's Blue Book (which this year carried a red cover!) should contain standing orders;\nformal business at UGM's must be sped up so that\neverybody is able to take part in debate.\nI am not a person who sits in an ivory tower immune\nfrom current events, I have the ability to get things done,\nI am an eminently suitable man for the job.\nI remain, Sir,\nthe Union's servant,\nMartin C. Black.\nMore Elections\nDear Editor,\nFor once I'm not wasting space in your admirable\npublication by talking about general apathy in IC for\nICU. That would be a waste of time! What has disgusted\nme\u2014even in this cynical state\u2014is the general level of\nactual disinterest from those who actually attend ICU\nmeetings and appear concerned.\nI think the last straw was the election of Student\nResidence Officer (and one or two others) last term.\nHaving made a specific point of information regarding\nabstentions at the Union meeting in question, I was not\nsurprised to see so many abstentions (20 per cent) for\nSRO compared with about 40 each for the remainder.\nFinal figures were:\nWinning Candidate ... 183\nOther * 143\nAbstentions ... 82\nPapers 7\nTotal 415\nYou don't need a Mathematics Degree (sic) to see\nthat the winner didn't have a50 per cent majority do\nyou? And you should not need reminding of an analogous example either!\nThis raises a number of questions:\n(a) Why so many abstentions?\nWhy accepted?\nWhy not challenged anyway?\nWhy am I bothered?\nAlternatives?\nWhat is worse?\nthink the large proportional of abstentions can\n(b)(c)( d)(e) \u2022(f) Well I be due to either voters being unable to choose between\napparently equal candidates and/or dissatisfaction\nwith both candidates.\nI understand the winning candidate was considered\nelected on the basis that the election was not true STV\n(which it certainly wasn't). Anyway there were 80 people that abstained and since\nthere could be a valid questioning of the election why\ndid no-one challenge? (You still can!). I nearly did. I wrote a letter and delivered it but then withdrew it.\nJohn B. Stares\nMaths. Dept. Rep. (72/73\u2014unopposed).\n(This letter has been shortened\u2014Ed.).\nBlack\nHatred\nDear Editor,\nOn reading M. C.B.'s letter my Super cultural mind\nsprang immediately to\nShakespeare; \"It is a tale\ntold by an idiot, Full of\nsound and fury signifying\nnothing\".\nThe pompous and\npedantic ramblings contain within it maintain\nthe standards that we have\nall come to expect from\nM.C. B.( It's easy to guess\nwhat the C stands for).\nThis pomposity in my opinion would serve to alienate\nthe ordinary members of\nthe Union whom he is pretending to want to draw\ninto the mainstream of\nunion life.\nAll would be union executives make the predictable point of stating their\nvehement dislike of bur-e ac racy, M.C.... B. is no\nexception. He promises us\nthe ultimate in Student\nUnions; a streamlined Corporation over which he\nwould pontificate and enact his fantasies of being a big business entrepreneur,\nquite a frightening thought.\nWhat this organisation, run\nby Zurich type gnomes\nheaded by M.C....

These were Country\nJoe's first words as he\ntook the stage on Saturday night and the audience obediently echoed it.\nOf course it was a sham\nthis time\u2014just to test\nwhether the audience were\neating out of his hand,\nwhich they were. In his\nhand he had lots of goodies\u2014a very fine show, in\nthe words of \"Entertain-ment is my Business\". The\nsongs never lost the attention of the audience\nwhether they were lewd,\nlike \"Movie-Ola\" and \" On notch of your c.\", sad, like \"The Ballad of\nJean Duprez\", simple optimistic songs like \"Free\nsome day\" or the acid\n(perhaps the wrong word\nin County Joe's case)\ndigs at people in high\nplaces like \"Tricky-Dicky\n(He's a genuine plastic\nman)\" for Richard Nixon.\nThat's the way to sing protest songs, right? A lighthearted dig, and not a clumsy pseudo-accusation\nassociated with groups\nlike Chicago.\nNearly all the songs,\nwith the exception of\n\"Jean Duprez\" were short\nand to the point and for\nthis reason there were far\ntoo many to be recorded\nin detail. But Country Joe\nwill always be associated\nwith anti-war (or at least\nanti-draft) songs and he\ndid of course do \"l Feel-Like-rm-Fixin'-To-Die-Rag\"\ncomplete with \" Fish\" chant, and the other anti-draft song called \"Kiss My\nAss\". Before the Vietnam Rag he told a long\nanecdote of how the police\nat Boston forbade the\ngroup to say \"it\", and his\ntrial for saying \"it\" at Wooster, Massachusetts. In his\ndefence, after having been\nasked what the word\n\" Fuck\" had to do with going to Vietnam, he said\nwell, when someone gets\na letter in the post saying\nhe's going to fight in Vietnam he'll probably say\n\"Oh Fuck\".\nRight On said the audience and they joined in\nwith the cheer just like the\ncrowd at Woodstock. I wonder how many of them\nreally had experienced the\ndraft. Still it's the singer,\nnot the audience, and Joe\nentertained par excel-len ce. Linda Lewis (again?)\ngave an excellent opening\nset with some wistful\nsongs about life and love\nand was warmly received\nby a surprisingly small\naudience.\nHIP, HIP, HOORAY!\nYes, another year of boring Presidential waffle is\ncoming to an end and as it's difficult for me to write\nit as it is no doubt for you to read it, I'm sure it's a reason for pints all round.\nIn Snapping Jaws I 've\ntried to implore you to\ncome to the last couple of\nUnion Meetings, so I thought I'd write something on those projects\nthat are underway at the\nmoment and will be happening before next October.\nBesides the developments with respect to the\n2 new bars and the new\nlower Refectory in the\nUnion, there is going to be\na general facelift given to\nthe Union Building this\nsummer. Nearly every\nroom in the Union will be\nrepainted and the floors\nsanded, there will be a revamping of the Concert\nHall Stage, general rewiring within the building\nand a new Gymnasium (or\nat least the old one should\nlook like that). Plans are\nin hand to turn the Room\nat the Top (formerly the\nUpper Refectory) into an\nInformation Centre with\nTravel and Insurance\nthere next year, an Office\nfor the Ents Committee\nand Dyelining and Duplicating facilities. Details\nare not complete yet, but\nif you have any other ideas\nof ways to make use of this\nunique opportunity or suggestions for paint schemes\netc., then contact me in\nthe Union Office.\nWhile we're still pressing to get a Weekly Felix\nwith a sabbatical Editor\nnext year, we are also investigating to what extent\nwe should finance the expansion of STOIC. To that\nend I 've prepared a survey\non the student TV services\nat the moment running in\nBritish Universities \u2014 replies are still coming in,\nbut in talking to a number\nof Presidents I 've found\nthat expansion is ex pen sive. However a number\nof Colleges, e.g. Brunei\nhave very effective Campus Radio operations\u2014\nthey run for example for\n1\u00a3 hours per morning and\n3 hours per evening, 5\ndays a week. I hope, during this term, to look into\nthe possibility of ICU starting a campus Radio, next\nyear. During this term, I think it has been realised\nthis year how vital good\ncommunications are to the\nwell being of the Union\nand hopefully these appraisals of the various\nAbsolutely\nthe last\nPresident's Piece\n(this year!)\ncommunications media\npossible within ICU will\nbear fruit in the years to\ncome.\nAnother campaign I hope to wage this Summer\nTerm is to list the Accommodation Bureaux within\nthe area, and with the aid\nof Nick Gregory, The\nUnion Solicitor, to seek out\nthose bureaux acting in\ncontravention of the Accommodation Agencies act\nand to black them in coordination with the local\nTrades Council and at the\nsame time put pressure on\nthe Local Council to put\npressure on these agen-cie s. So we're by no means\nslacking now your backs\nare turned and you're facing examination papers\u2014\nkeep watching Snapping\nJaws (there should be four\nmore issues left).\nThanks for bearing with\nme for so long. Best of\nluck with the exams and\nhave a good Summer!\nSo you need to\nearn a living?\nIt would be fair to say that most students do not want\nto leave college, much preferring the free and easy\nway of life. Unfortunately all good things must come to\nan end and in one year's time, from which you will\ngather this article is aimed at this year's second year,\nthis will be the case for the majority of you!

He will undoubtedly be busy first term next\nyear so why not take the\nopportunity of his free time\nthis term and have a chat\nwith him. An appointment\ncan be made with this\ngentleman through the\nAppointments Office Room\n306 College Block.\nIf you want a job there\nis no time to delay!\nTo those students who\nare going to wait for a job\nto come to them and to\nthose students who believe\nfirms are just tearing their\nhair out to employ graduates I implore them to be\na little more thoughtful in\nthe dole queue. It has\nbeen proved these past\ntwo years, that if you want\na job you have to\ni) know what you want\nto do\nii) know where to get\nthis type of job\niii) work hard to get this\njob.\nSo why not take a couple of days after your\nexams this year and think\nabout getting a job.\nSO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?\nIf you know what you\nwant to do, where you can\ndo it, if you know the Managing Director, and his\nson or daughter, do not\nworry, you will probably\nget a job.\nAPPLY EARLY TO FIRMS!\nWARNING THIS MAN\nIS INSANE\nOliver Francis\nDOWSON\n\" Felix \" Editor\n1972-3\nFriday, 2nd June\nR.C.S.

Challenge Cup at Motspur Park on Saturday, 11th March. A large number of\nthe Club supporters travelled with the team to Motspur Park and cheered them to a50 victory.\nStraight from the kick-off the I.C. team began to show their supremacy and ten\nminutes into the game the Q.E. C. defence failed to clear a J. Kelly corner and M. Pearson was left with the easiest of tasks to put I.C. one up. This raised the confidence of the team and they continued to dominate the play. The I.C. defence had\ncomplete control of the Q.E. C. attack and this seemed to inspire the rest of the team\nto play some imaginative and rewarding football. I.C. increased the lead when B. Milne beat the Q.E. C. 'keeper with a header from aC. Willcock free kick. By half\ntime the lead had been increased to 3 goals to nil. B. Smith had endorsed the\nI.C. superiority, when following a fluid move down the left flank, N. Fryer pulled\nthe ball back across the Q.E. C. goal for Smith to head just inside the far post.\nThe second half was more even with the I.C. team relaxing a little and allowing\nQ.E. C. more possession of the ball. However, they did not have the ability to break\nthrough a solid I.C. defence, and although I.C. were not playing with the same attacking flair as they did in the first half they added yet another goal scored by B. Milne. With the ground now becoming rather cut up, and the Q.E. C. team resigned\nto defeat, the I.C. team re-asserted their superiority. They began to push the ball\naround the pitch, and dictate the pattern of play. The final goal came from P. Worthington, who overlapped from his normal full back position to see the opposing defence open up before him, and his shot left the Q.E. C. 'keeper with no chance.\nThis was a great finish to a good season, and after the final whistle the achievement of retaining the trophy for the second successive season was celebrated by\nteam and su porters alike.\nTeam: M. Whitham, P. Worthington, P. Maslin, S. Wells, M. Pearson, N. Fryer,\nB. Smith, C. Willcock (capt.), B. Milne, J. Kelly, I. Rodgers, P. Bartlett.\nBADMINTON Best Ever Year\nIn the three years I have been at I.C. the season has been by far the most successful of all.\nPreviously main achievements were primarily restricted to 1st team efforts.\nThis season, however, has seen every team do more than just pull its weight as the\nleague table shows.\nMens I1s t We tried to win them all but didn't quite\nMens II 1st manage it. The IV mens incidentally lost the\nMens III 1st league by 1 game. The ladies, though start-Mens IV 2nd ing off badly, really showed what they could\nMixed I1s t do towards the end of the season. The\nMixed II 1st tragic game against Q.M. C. cost them the\nLadies 2nd league. Ah well, that's life !\nUndoubtedly the Great Hall has been the reason for the Club's success, and\nhopefully the Club next season will be even more successful as far as extending\nits facilities to non-team members. Club play will be one of the main points that\nnext year's committee will try and promote, so I hope that people will take advantage of this. Moving on:\u2014\nThe B.U.S. F. championships were held in Edinburgh this year. The team included 4 selections from I.C., Stu Donald, George Georgiou and Dave Ward, Sue\nThompson as reserves. Georgiou and Donald have all 3 medals now. Gold, Silver\nand Bronze, never mind, eh!\nThe U.L. U. Championships:\nMens Doubles \u2014 Donald \u2014 Georgiou I.C. Mixed Doubles \u2014 Miss Hilary Rowson \u2014 Georgiou I.C. Mens Singles \u2014 Closing finalist S. Donald I.C.A mention must be made of the ladies doubles (Sue Thompson, Hilary Rowson) who did well to get to the semi-finals but unfortunately lost to the eventual winners.\nOur annual singles championships was won this year by G. Georgiou in one of\nthe closest finals to say the least. 18-17, 12-15, 18-17; 4 rackets were broken in the\nprocess of this game which added to the excitement of the game and the despair\nof Georgiou (they were his). The men's handicap has now, ! think, become as\ntraditional as the men's singles. It was won this year by Georgiou and Donald\nagainst a very steady pair (except for right at the end of the game) Ward and\nPalmer 21-19, 21-19.\nThe last achievement by the Club was the winning of the U.L. U. knockout\ntournament. Thanks go to Hilary Rowson, Brenda Dilly, Sue Thompson 'Souki'\nDave Ward, Stu Donald and George Georgiou. I should end for fear of getting this\nedited with a final thank-you to the committee, Chris Gaukroger, Dick Thompson,\nJohn Powell, Steve Sanderton, for all their co-operation and enthusiasm. The delectable Hilary must also be thanked for doing an excellent job of captaining the\nladies and demonstrating her very strong objections at the committee meetings.\nBradford\nBarrel\nGoes To\nIC\nEvery year, Bradford\nUniversity Sailing Club\nholds an inter-University\nTeam Racing Tournament\nin Firefly dinghies, to\nwhich a selection of the\nbest British teams are in-vite d. Last year I.C. came\nsecond, being beaten by\nTrinity College Dublin\nonly on the result of a pro-test, so we were determined to win this year. The\ntournament is half-Ameri-can (each team sails all\nthe others once), the winner being the team winning\nthe most races, or by\npoints in the case of a draw.\nSaturday's courses were\nshort, so that good positions at the start line\nmeant more than team tactics during the race, and\nthe results served to show\nI.C. that their starts could\ndo with some improve-ment. We did not get all\nthe 1st three positions in\nany of the races, but managed to beat every team\nwe sailed against, except\nBangor. The races were\ngenerally friendly, although\nthe race against T.C.D. caused us to protest\nfor some pretty dirty tac-tics, but with proverbial\nIrish blarney they got away\nwith it at the hearing.\nSunday left us two races\nto sail. Some good team\nracing gave us our first\n1,2,3 against Bradford, and\na further win against Notingham (revenge!) meant\nthe trophy was ours.\nTeam:\nHelms: Ed Hyams, Alan\nCurran, Derek Clark.\nCrews: Peter Waite, Graham Eastwood, Mike Martin.\nResults:\nAgainst:\nLeeds 14-6|, St. Andrews 15-6f, Reading 16-7f, Bangor 8f12,T. C.D.128 f, Southampton 12-8J, Aston 11-9|, Manchester\n13-7f, Bradford 15-5f, Nottingham 14-6f. Graham Eastwood.\nEDITORIAL\nA great year for I.C.! Almost every club has won a major trophy which leaves us far and away the best\ncollege on the field of sport. In fact I hope some of\nthe other colleges in ULU read this so that next\nyear they will be able to arrange some acceptable\nopposition.\nWe have taken the \"big three\", that is the ULU\nFootball, Rugby and Hockey Cups which was last\nachieved by I.C.( who else!) in the early sixties.\nMr. Georgiou's badminton club has again been\nas boring as ever, winning everything in sight. His\ndemands for space have not gone un-noticed but\nhis command of English does seem to be excessive.\nThis term, sport still functions in I.C. in the form\nof the Cricket and Tennis clubs whose support must\ncome from P.G.' s and undergraduates with sense.\nThe Tennis club, having lost heavily in the first\ngame, expect to improve during the season.\nRuss Smith has an easier job because at least 3 or 4\nfresher s have looked good enough to fill the vacant positions\nin the cricket 1st XI. There is enough experience to see the\ncricket club to their third win in succession \u2014 in the ULU\nCup although there is still a lack of really good fast bowlers.\nThe year has proved a successful one for all clubs; the\nimpression that has been gained by the editor is that whilst\nfirst teams have been consistently good, all members of the\nclubs have had a chance to compete and gain enjoyment\nfrom their sport\nIn the last issue of FELIX, I should like to wish everybody\nthe best of luck with exams, and I hope to see you all lining\nup for the first games of next year.\nCastaways Cup Victory!\nFor the fourth year in succession I.C. won Castaways'\nCup\u2014the U.L. inter college Team Racing Championships\u2014at the Welsh Harp.\nOriginally 3 teams were entered from I.C. in this\nknockout competition. Each round of the competition\nconsisted of two races\u2014the teams changing boats\nbetween races.\nThe third team won their preliminary round but were\nunlucky to be eliminated in the first round in Saturday's blustery conditions.\nThe other two teams fought their way eventually to\nmeet in the semi-final. This proved to be a very exciting\nmatch with the second team sailing very well to contain the first team to a very narrow win in the first race\n10 to f. However in the light winds of Sunday afternoon,\nthe first team had an easy victory 5 f to 15\u2014total score\n15f to 25f. The first team then met Guy's Hospital in the final.\nThe first race started with I.C. in a disastrous position\n4,5,6, but close fought tactics eventually found the team\n2,4,5 on the finish line\u2014losing by 1J points 11 to 9f.
