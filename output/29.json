It see irs to me to be utterly pointless and futile to whip\nup a false sense of antagonism between members\nof the same college in order to stage a battle royal on Morphy Day.\nThis is Just a personal opinion and I would not have thought of airing it but for the fact that other people have been trying to force their views on to me.

The possibilities are endless - Scepticus\nhas a vision! However, when you,sir, _\nproposals were not in jest I was somewhat annoyed.\nI, therefore,carefully scrutinised the viewpoint. My\nannoyance melted to pity. Pity for a student who so\ncompletely missed the object of College life( which\nis what his article primarily attacks and not solely\nthe Hostel). Pity for a gentleman who has so little faith in human nature. Pity for a fellow whose in te rests are so narrow that he is liable to \"become a brown b agger in self defence\". Pity for a, self appointed outcast.\nFor surely the main and rather broad object of\na residential college life is to afford one an opportunity of finding one's feet in life. Most students\ncome to I.C. direct from a sheltered home and school\nlife or even from a rather unnatural service life. By entering the Hostel they obtain an excellent\nopportunity to learn a considerable amount about\ntheir fellows and, what is perhaps more important,\nabout themselves. No one can deny that there is a back-slapping and noisy rug ber talking facet to n many\nsided Hostel life. Why should it be denied anyway?\nThe world is made up of a great variety of types of\nwhom this particular group is one that must receive\nattention like the rest. Our job is not to turn away\nnot-agree with their views out we must learn to\ntolerate them. This we partially do by the numerous\ninformal discussions that take place nightly over\ncups of coffee. Other opportunities are afforded\nby the multitude of college activities that can more\neasily be attended by the resident student.\nAgain, examinations give a fair idea of ability at one's studies but one needs the chance of assessing one's non-academic potentialities. Surely it is a great asset to know how others will react to one's own views and methods of dealing with people,before\nventuring into the competitive outside world.\nTherefore I suggest that Scepticus has a closer\nlook at Hostel life before he levels any further unconstructive criticism based on superficial and\nlimited knowledge, for such unthinking remarks may\ndo more harm than good.\nYours,etc.\nD.

The Lowry result\ngoing equally astray, though the eight who sporting ly started the race with a broken oar rowed like winners\nalmost all the way.\nCongratulations to the Soccer Club on their fine\nperformance against N.K. C. It is a great pity,almost\nthe same team playing in Guild's jerseys should give\nsuch a disheartening display against the Mines Rugger\neleven, who won the first game of the Technology Cup\ncompetition.\nThere never was any doubt as to who would win\nthe U.L. Cross Country Championship. It was only a question of by how great a margin, well done I. C.C.C.C! With, so many dazzling successes of other clubs,\nthe Hugger Club people feel they should refrain from\n..ub li city until they too have won aU.L. cup; but\ntheir record to date of - 9 won, 2 drawn, 2 lost games\nis very creditable, in view of the prominence of some\nof their opponents. When the team has mastered the\nart of falling on the loose ball, the Cup will be well\nwithin their grasp.\nBOXING\nQuite a large audience witnessed a fine\nperformance by I.C. Boxing Club when they beat\nKing's College by 4 bouts to I in the gymnasium\non Tuesday 27th November.\nMalcolm Muir, who is to be congratulated\non his twice being selected to represent U.L. this season, gave I.C. the lead by winning the\nfirst bout from D. Jessett on a very close points\ndecision. Kings' drew level when the versatile. L. Dujon gained a points decision over John Davies\nbut were hardly in the picture during the rest of\nthe evening.\nAfter a quiet exhibition bout by two boxers\nfrom Goldsmiths' College, Peter Harding put I.C. ahead when he gained the verdict over J. Sharpe.\nLen Palmer, the I.C. Flyweight, delighted the\nspectators with some excellent boxing in his ex-hi bit ion with R. Leigh. Len certainly earned the\napplause at the end of the bout since he was a stone lighter than his opponent.\nThe last two bouts of the evening both\nyielded points victories for the I.C. men, Bill Shepherd beating D. Gill and Ricky Forscher\nbeating the amusingly unorthodox R. Campbell.\nFENCING\nThere have been no deaths in the Club\nthis year. This is probably due to the high\nproportion of beginners. ( I must, in pas-sing, record the fact that there have been no\nbirths either; but the reason for this escapes me.) The classes on Monday and\nThursday evenings have been well attended,\nand there is plenty of talent among this year's newcomers, amongst whom we have four from\nI. C.W. A. Owing to an accident, for which we\nwere not responsible, to M.L^ on Paul, we have\nbeen short of one instructor for the whole of\nthe term, but Mr. Za biel ski, pronounced George,\nhas been carrying on successfully alone.\nOn the sole occasion this term on which\nwe were able to employ our full team, we beat\nthe Polytechnic 16 - 11. The remainder of our matches against King's College Hospital, St. Paul's, Westminster, Dulwich College,\nagainst whom we lost narrowly 13 - 1h, were less\nsuccessful - owing to the claims, and effects, of another I.C. Club,'the University and the\nCommemoration Ball on members of the team.\nJUDO\nIn the first match of the year, King's College decisively beat the I.C. team by three\nmatches to nil, with five draws (\n1\n+ points to\nnil), although most matches were hard fought.\nThe beginners' bouts ended usually in draws,\nas is so often the case before many throw B have\nbeen mastered. Both of King's(3 rd Kyu) scored\ntwo points off Phillip s,I.C.(2 nd Kjru) , the\nfirst being a particularly well executed ankle-throw. Our President, K.A. Everard (1st K| ru)\ndid well against Wetenhall (1st Kyu) , who is rumoured to have been practising hard of late. V/e ten hall threw Everard only once, by a cunning\na shi guru ma cum-oso to gari. All members of the\nI.C. Club, not only those in the team, will have to practise harder, if future matches are\nto end more favourably for I.C. MORPHY-DAY\nThe weather was fine, with afresh south-e rly wind and a fast ebb tide, as the three\ncrews paddled up to the start of the Morphy Oup.\nRSM. were on the Surrey station, O&G. in the\nCentre and ROS. on Middlesex.

A word of praise must go to the O&G.o ox for his tactics at this point, for though\nrather heavy-handed with the rudder, he nevertheless used his commanding lead to keep RSM.\nout of the stream between Harrods and the Mile\nPost and at the same time enticed RCS. too far over to Surrey, from wh i oh position only sudden\nand drastic action saved a clash as Gardner\nbrought Guilds back to their own station.

    "content": "FELIX A NOTE ON BEETONS FUNCTION HISTORICAL\nSince the days of NEWTON, students compiling laboratory reports have often found that several of their experimental observations appear to be at variance with the theoretical laws which their lecturers have decreed shall govern the events they are investigating. The earliest attempts to make these results acceptable to examiners and\nmoderators were usually made by the method suggested by BOYLE by the application to the worst results of an arb it ary constant C( the culinary constant). This method gives a good first approximation and is still widely used where the time factor is important( e.g. when only two days\nremain to write seven reports). Later research has de velo oed more powerful methods, particularly those of BEET ON and COOKE which are the subject of this note. COOKE'S LAW\nCOOKE (1916) suggested that the use of the\nCulinary Constant C had the disadvantage that a check of the calculations would instantly reveal its use and the resulting report, being inconsistent, was aesthetically unsatisfactory. He enunciated the famous law which bears his name and\nwhich may be stated as follows: \"In any set of experimental observations, if some observations lead to results which are clearly incorrect and require amendment, the observations must be amended at the same time to conform to the\namended results.\" This was a great advance, but still left the\nstudent without guidance on which results to amend\nand by how much to amend them.\nThe Work of BEETON\nBESTCN (1949) revolutionised previous methods\nand in the short time since his paper was pub-li shed his methods have found widespread accept ance. BEETON'S contribution may be summarised\nas follows. If a dependent variable y obeys the relation y= f(x), experimental determination of the relations hip can be represented by y= f(x+ s) where s is an independent random variable introduced by ex peri mental error. BEETON points out that in all practical cases s may be replaced by a new\nvariables introduced by calculating values of x from suitably chosen values of y on a slide rule working to2 significant figures only. Thus the relationship becomes y= f(x+ s) which is BEETON'S FUNCTION.\nWHERE THE \"TIME\nFACTOR lS\\Mf\u00bbORTANT\nINTRODUCED B>y exPERt MENTAl. ERROR. Amp li cations of BEEION'S Function It is unnecessary to point out how the use of BEETOil'S function reduces the labour of laboratory work.\nThe actual observations are worked out from\nthe known laws governing the experiment to be\nperformed before entering the laboratory. If no'\nsuch laws exist suitable data can be obtained from\nthe Laboratory Reports of previous years'( successful) students. Actual work in the laboratory is reduced to two quick readings to determine the\napproximate range of which the apparatus is capable. The remainder of the laboratory time\nmay be spent in the consumption of coffee. Further Research Further research is in hand to extend the\nprinciples of the work of COOKE and BEETON to ease\nthe lot of the post graduate student engaged in original work. Here, the difficulty is that the\nfundamental laws on which the calculation is to be\nbased are' usually unknown. Some success has been\nachieved with the aid of a crystal ball pur chas ed\nfrom Government surplus stocks( Balls, crystal, gazing, Engineers,22 C/1380) but this method is nearly as laborious and little more accurate than actual laboratory work.\n( Continued at! the foot of the next column.)\nS SER PX EYL I AD No matter how uninteresting the news, this morn-ing, one can be sure that the average dally paper will have contrived some way of making it interesting. Whatever has happened, a conference, opening of\"new\nbuildings, etc., it's a foregone conclusion that the papers will find some member, of the female sex who is, at least, remotely connected with it. The only other requirements are that she should have been photo graphed in a bathing costume, and been involved in a major scandal. Let us take an example from j she \"Sserpxe Y li ad\" this fic tito us title would be catchy enough for any paper.\nIt was reported that Mr. Churchill was to meet\nPresident Truman. The problem confronting the papers\nis how to bring these dry facts home to such as Mrs.\nSmith who is washing some_ Q.S.\" small s\" in Swindon.\nThey are the common folk of these islands the backbone of Old England. Their language is simple. They have learnt all there is to know about the high cost of living, death duties and- 19/6 in the \u00a3, in the severe classroom of everyday life. But, ask them\nwhat a Coalition is and few could tell you and I doubt whether you'd get one to tell you how many\nmasts it has. Nov/, let us look at the way in which the dailies bring this news of Mr. Churchill to us.. Do they show\na photo of the Premier and give a learned explanation of \" balance of payments\"? No, that would bore them.\nInstead our paper, with commendable research, finds a gentleman, who hay pens to be an American who\nhappens to have met Mr. Churchill during the war. By\ngreat good fortune he also has a country mansion at which it is within the bounds of _p p.ss j._b ili. ty. J; hat. Mr\nChurchill might stay. Lastly, and most - essential, he\nhas a wife who, being attractive, has been photo graphed in a bathing costume.\nThat catches them.. Put a headline two in ci. es\nhigh on the front page and nobody notices it, but give Betty Grable a two column spread and every body sits up. Think what a 'wow' FELIX would be with:' SWEETHEART'S SCARF - WINNING EIGHT'S TALISMAN\nA pretty crepe de chin e scarf depicting beauty\nspots of the \" Potteries\" fluttered in the breeze\nas the winners of the Lowry Cup (see Sports Review:\nAlan Knobby) flashed, past the post yesterday. The\nscarf was at the neck of Bob Merryweather who cox ed the victorious Mines Vl ll to finish3 lengths up. Many admired the charming scarf worn by the\nhandsome fair haired student, but few realised that it brought unexpected luck to the crew.\nThe scarf belongs to Miss Felicity Filigree,. who is Merryweather's fiancee. At their last meeting,\nMiss Filigree thrust the scarf into Bob's hand with the injunction: \"Wear it, it' ll bring you and your boys luck, Sonny\" (She has always called him Sonny\never since he told her he was the Marquis of Blandford) \"Oh - and for heaven's sake, don't get your trousers wet or you' ll catch your death o' cold\". With these words of encouragement, Miss Filigree left to return to her work as Rodent Operative in Maida Vale, and, unfortunately, was not able to wit ness Bob's victory. When interviewed after the race and told of the\ncrew's success. Miss Filigree was almost speechless with delight, but managed to say to our reporter \"He better, hadn't get any flour on my scarf. Well I gotta push - I'm after another rat now\".\nSuch is the nature of this pure and generous Engl is. maid- she never. lets work inter fefe with her pleasure.

DEBATE\nOne of the beet debates of recent months\nwas held in the U.L. U. Hut on 23rd November,\nbut although it was comparatively well attended (as debates go), members of I.C. Union were\nconspicuously absent.\nThe motion before the House was that \"This\nHouse believes that the first allegiance of\nthe creative artist is to himself. The principal speakers were from the Universities of\nCambridge, Cardiff, Dublin, St. Andrews, Sheff ie ld and London; and the motion was carried by\na narrow margin.\nIt is a great pity that there seems to be\nvery little enthusiasm for debating among members of I.C. Union and even among members of\nU.L. U. because it mean's that an old and valuable\nUniversity activity is being neglected. Debating\nas we know it has been associated with the Univ ers i ties for over a hundred years and modern\ndebating has its origins in the scholastic disputations practised in the mediaeval Universities. Other Universities have strong debating traditions and it is to be hoped that some effort will be\nmade to make debating a regular part of Union\nact iv t it y at I.C. as well as at U.L. There is to be one more U.L. U. debate this term on the 'Mother or Child' controversy with,\nit is hoped, speakers from the Society of Jesuits and the medical profession. Next term there\nwill be debates on politics and the arts,among\nother topics.\nL.C. MUSICAL SOCIETY CONCERT\nIt is a great honour that Dr. Reginald Jacques\nshould have undertaken the regular conducting of the\nI.C. Choir. Dr.Jacques succeeded in putting a polish on the choir singing that gave real distinction to\nthe performance of Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratoria.\nThe two soloists, Eileen Price and Bryan Corrie, sang\nin a manner worthy of the conductor and of the occasion.\nVaughan Williams' 100th Psalm - performed by the Choir\non Commemoration Day - gained im measure ably from the\nbetter acoustics of the Q.A. H. concert hall compared\nwith the University Great Hall. The other vocal works\nincluded groups of madrigals and carols, and. 'a is me charming solos sung by Eileen Price. Of the Jacques.\nOrchestra one can only say that they amply maintained\ntheir high reputation for sensitive playing and\nensemble; particularly in their exquisite rendering of\na Purcell Chacony, and the joyous and vigorous performance of Hoist's St.Paul's SuiteS Y MP OSI UM ON EATING A DOUBLE -pAGE SPREAD-(sec pages 4\u00bbi) "

WEARNE\nA.F.m* This being our second birthday, we are devoting some\nspace to a survey of landmarks in ou-r short history. FELIX has appeared fortnightly for29 issues and has established a place in college life. We\nhave settled down to a fairly steady pattern, being limited financially in printing standards, and on\nthe contribution side by the regularity of the events\nwe chronicle. The Board has to exert great ingenuity in order to avoid monotony.' We wear out staff rapidly half a year being the mean Editorial life. FELIX first appeared on 9 th December 1949. Ted\nHughes ( hitherto unemployed\") was the Editor and\nreported their own arrival together with the scoop of a term's events.600 copies were quickly sold out, and\nin the following two terms, one thousand were sold regularly. The reluctant \u00a35 backing by the Union, extracted by Derek Howe, then Guilds President, was\nsoon proved good business. FELIX No. 2 started the\nProfile series with \"The Bar\". A series of ' Drinking Mans Guide' tottered from issue to issue. Ted Hughes handed over to Clifford Hargreaves at the\nend of the summer. No. 10 was a Fresher s' number for last year, and was the first to be printed photo-graphically, as at present. In this process the same\nbody of typescript is reduced to' fit six pages. The\ngreatest advantage of this new style is that any\nblack and white illustrations can be reproduced, including photographs if a special print is prepared\nby 'screening! Issue No. 10 published a large map of\nthe district. for the fresher, and No. 11 followed with the first Road-Test, on ' Cross lays' Cowley'\nand this Pin-Up :-No. 14, reporting the Mines\nwin in the Morphy, celebrated our first birthday with a short l review of the early Union politics of FELIX.\nIn the spring John Midgley succeeded Clifford Hargreaves\nas Editor. By then the layout of the paper was settling down\nto its present form : Sports page at the back, News on the\nfront and letters to the J^5\"\" Editor' on page two. A series of 'Viewpoints'\nbegan including' Culture in I.C.','A paper University' in the field of\nthe InterCollegiate scheme discussions, etc.' We recorded the Rectors' visit to America and an\nR.C.S, Smoking Concert\nand made full use of the Festival Club and Britain. By the end of last summer the planned ill u stra tion of articles was effective. balancing the lack of\nideas for cartoons. The present aim is the development of our own ' screening' process. Our photo-graphic advisors have been working a year on fin ding a substitute for the commercial screen, price j \u00a375. (They need more assistance now).\n1200 to1250 copies were sold regularly throughout last year, the finance of the printing process\nremaining slightly in. our favour until the rise in paper costs which resulted in the general increase in national newspaper prices. FELIX decided to keep to its original price, and to make up the loss by organising social events. The FELIX dance last term provided this sufficient until next Easter, and thus we kept our independance. We consider that finance is the greater part of dependance,\nand it is interesting to note that our contemporary\nat Queen Mary College receives up to \u00a3125 a year, We are only responsible to the Union for p of tio y and financial sanity; through our Board of Direct ors, the Officers of the Union. Sales now touch the 1300 mark. The new Board is greatly changed from that band of early enthusiasts. At the moment it is still incomplete, and though\nfew members are in the Hostel, we rely enormously\non the help of residents for production and sales. You, the reader, should realise that our newspaper can only improve when we receive enough copy\nto make a proper balance between the interests of\nthe three colleges, the clubs, the hostel and the\nnonresidents. P.S.A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL OUR READERS.\nof the Bowls\nPROFILE*A. F.Ill Anno F eli c istres. I he re are many to whom the Lancashire cotton town of Rochdale may\nseem just another drab, un roman tio, industrial conglomeration, situated pn the rain swept slopes of the Penn in es. This town, however, has given birth to two great English Institut ions - the Cooperative Movement, and\nGracie Fields. Although it is not\nsuggested that Jack Raymond Howerth i a an Institution, or even a bighearted star of variety, it is not inappropriate that he should have bean born\nand bred in Rochdale. For in his six foot six of skin and bone he incorporates those distinct Northern characteristic of solid, down-to-earth common sense, and an unrivalled capacity for hard work. In no-one\ncould the old saying \"work hard, play hard\" be better illustrated than in \"Our Jack.\" Educated at Rochdale HighSchool, he completed one year in industry before going to Loughborough College. Here he obtained a plum coloured blazer of phenomenal length, which some\nmay claim to ba the inspiration for the new Guilds blazer. He also obtained a First class Honours diploma\nin mechanical engineering, and made a reputation for athletic prowess, especially at bowls and liard ice. A period of recuperation followed, when he found himself a comfortable niche, as asap per sub alter n, on the\nRock of Gibraltar. The war was by\nthis time over, and he was able to take full advantage of the base to\nfurther his research into the habits, and ancient customs of the Spanish mainland. He indignantly denies that concern in the fall of the ape population was the reason for his posting. Some would say that like all sensible Northerners he emigrated to\nthe South. but, in any case, he came\nto Guilds in1949, as a student in the\nElectrical Department. From his earliest days in College he has been\nassociated with the Union in all its varied forms, and it is not surprising that he has become a widely influential figure in the present day running of our affairs. As President of Guilds\nhe is living up to his guiding principle that a job worth doing, is worth doing well. Jack is dogmatic when he speaks\nof Union activities. He thinks that the Union is of sufficient scope to\nprovide interest for all tastes, and\nany person who does not give his \"whole available energy\" to such an\nenterprise is not worthy of a pl'ace\nin College. The more lethargic amongst us must admire Jack's undoubted\nsincerity. His present pet a version is\" Felix\". As a rug ger player his approach\nto the game is in the highest traditions of the game, and the spirit, and standing of the I.C. Club is entranced by his able leadership. Those who hear his stentorian voice on the more informal occasions might be\nsurprised to hear that his interest in song goes somewhat deeper. A member\nof the Choir, which rendered the first performance of \"An Invocation to Science he regrets that his crowded life no\nlonger permits his active support of the official College songsters. Howarth at home is characterised by his collection of smoking utensils, and wide range of readable literature. Perhaps it is as well that his record library is kept in the relative safety of \"oh ez lui.\" An interest in walking is claimed, and the landlord of the\nfamous Moorcock Inn could no doubt subs t anti ate this. Jack wishes to repudiate the\nrumour that at the end of the year he\nwill take up a course in Civil Engineer ing, at Cambridge. This is to be\nregretted, for he would surely maka an\nexcellent football secretary for St.\nJohn's! "
