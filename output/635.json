    "content": "WAIKA80UTLOOKSEE \\\\\nby Mobile Optics inc.\n4^\nIf you walk northwards along Exhibition Road\nand cross over into the Park, two minutes\nfurther on, on the Kensington Gardens (left\nhand) side of the road, you will come across\nthe Serpentine Gallery. Exhibitions of modern\nart are shown there by the Arts Council and\ncurrently the gallery is shared by two\nexhibitions of works made during the last\nfourteen years. Both Tony Carter (sculptor)\nand Martin Froy (painter) take reality as their\nstarting point, but that's about the only link\nbetween them. Martin Froy most frequently\nuses the orthodox media of oils and\nwatercolours to express impressions of\ninteriors and landscapes: Tony Carter\nemploys any medium, or combination of\nmedia, to give concrete expression to his\nsensations and ideas.\nPaintings, constructions, drawings\nFroy's140 works demonstrate his continuous\nexperimentation within the two dimensions of\ncanvas and paper, and sometimes border on\nthe third dimension with 'bas relief con-struct ions. Two landscapes hang side by side, one in\nthe acid lemon and lime green colours of a spring hedgerow, the other in shades of\nbleached denim and rolled oats\u2014a cold, empty\nbeach. In both the paint is applied thickly; the\nsurfaces are encrusted, and mottled like a Berber carpet. His two kitchen interiors share\nnone of this emphasis on surface texture.\nSmooth-edged areas of colour depict shape\nand suggest fruit and vegetables, a dresser\nwith the top drawer open and a homely clutter\nIREVIEWSI\nof pots and jars. The colours are those of\nsunshine on candy\u2014soft blue-greens and gold\nwith splashes of vibrant pink. The same soft\nluminosity is recognisable in some of Froy's watercolours: 'Primaries' and 'The Loire at\nPouilly' have the appeal of life through rose-tinted spectacles. By contrast, his biu e and\ngrey watercolours show a precisely observed\nworld of strawberry plants, Welsh hills and\nsummer thunderstorms.\nIn her introduction to the exhibition\ncatalogue, Judy Marie writes that Froy is\ndriven by a determination that each work\n'should impress itself at once as being alive and\ngenuine'\u2014the life in his pictures is unquestionable. It's a positive self-confident life,\nsometimes gaudy, occasionally subdued,\nrarely straying from the path of good taste. As\nsuch, it would grace most walls, with little risk\nof causing offence.\nImages of subject/object duality\nIf Froy's work has much immediate appeal\u2014to\nthe eye and the emotions\u2014Tony Carter's sculptures are either easier, or a lot harder, to\nget to grips with. The objects he uses are\nundisguised\u2014a spirit level, a saucepan, a knife\u2014but have been subtly changed, by their\nsetting or by the process of their 'decoration',\nin accordance with the artist's subjective\nvision.\nTwo precision engineered tuning forks, one\nbronze, one steel have gracefully ornate, even\nbotanical, prongs. They have the title 'Spring\nsong\u2014season turning'...sprung steel...turned,\npointed foot...two notes, as in the first cuckoo\nof spring...! The craftsmanship is superb, the\nresultant objects beautiful, and the title a jo ky riddle. This is both the appeal and the\nfrustration of Carter's3D still life sculptures.\nTheir subject/object duality is a cryptic tease,\na sort of visual Times crossword and, just like\n3 - DOWN, may be either rewarding or\nbamboozling.\nThe faithful One' - after Picabia\nWhere, When, \u00a3?\nMartin Froy, Paintings, drawings and\nconstructions 1968-82, and Tony Carter,\nSculpture 1968-82, are at the Serpentine\nGallery, Kensington Gardens, till February 13,\nopen daily 10:00am5:00 pm.

    "content": "& 111\n<or\nFun for All? Dear Sir\nAs the girlfriend of a third\nyear Mining student, and one\nwho attended Friday night's Mines Review, I should like to\nmake a few comments on my\nimpression of the evening, and\nanswer in part the points raised\nin Mr Kelsey's letter which,\nappear in your January 28 issue.\nI found Friday night's entertaining neither offensive, dis-gusting, degrading, or pornographic and you may be interested to know nor did any of the\nother girls I spoke to. In reply to\nMr Kelsey's letter:\n1. In no way could the film\nthat was shown on Friday be\ndescribed as 'pornographic'. I feel a better description would\nbe 'mildly amusing'.\n2. I did not feel that the\nproceedings were in the least bit\noffensive to women. The whole\nevening was meant, and taken,\nin a light-hearted jocular fashion.\nI would never presume to state\nwhat was offensive to men\u2014I do\nnot see how he could possibly\ncategorically declare what is\noffensive to women.\n3. Let me assure Mr Kelsey\nthat I did not feel de-human is ed in the least.\nAs to the comment that \"lust\nreplaces love; rape replaces\nsex\". Anybody affected in this\nway by the Review I suspect is in\nserious need of help.\n4. In Mr Kelsey's third point\nthat such events degrade sex\u2014\nI'm afraid I fail to see the\nconnection between 'humorous\nt it il ation' and a sexual relationship between two people. He\ngoes on to say that in this day\nand age, 'pornography is the\ntheory, rape the practice', I would say that anybody who\ntakes pornography in a serious\nand disturbing way may very\nwell be a danger to so ce it y, but I cannot believe that a group of\npeople laughing at a slightly\nmore bizarre aspect of life poses\na real threat. ,, -Yours faithfully\nCreena McKay\nPog e2BB HH HM HH HUi Dear Martin\nThe 'freedom of will' argument used in last week's editorial\nto justify pornography (if all\nparties consent), has a fundamental flaw. You said that if a person commits rape then they\nwill be punished by law. If my\ndaughter/girl friend/mother was\nraped I would feel 'hang the\nbastard' rather than saying\n'OK, he will be punished by the\nlaw'. Law exists to protect not\npunish (hence the drink and\ndrive law, as an excellent\nexample of this).\nI would have thought that the\nevidence presented last week justified the statement that pornography especially when violent,\nde human is ed the victim in the\nsight of the 'observer', but judging by the response more reasoning is needed. We are all affected\nby the world around us, this is\nobvious in children, but people of\nall ages are affected. As an\nextreme example, men put\nthrough terrifying ordeals in\nwars, often end up deeply\npsychologically disturbed.\nIn pornography the attention\nis drawn (pulse quickens etc),\nthe mind becomes totally absorbed and the tension which\nthe 'performer' builds up is in\nthe body alone. It is this\nextreme tension in why people\nenjoy it (note motor-racing\ndrivers, etc, all enjoy the tension\ninvolved in the sport, and not so\nmuch the driving round a track).\nSince this tension is caused by\nthe body, then the body becomes\nthe critical factor involved,\nhence the de human is ation. This\napplies much more if the scenes\nare violent because these cause\nfurther tension (more excite-ment) so there is a tendency to\nenjoy these acts of violence. I am\nnot saying that a person actually\nthinks that a woman (or man) is\nnot human but, to take a lesser\nexample, if a certain person is\nconstantly being humiliated then\nsooner or later someone will\ninjure the victim because of an\nattitude rather than a thought.\nOne of the ways the Third Reich\nde human is ed Jews was to force\nnude Jewesses to dance on\ntables\u2014this was a positive policy\nof theirs, not an accidental side\nto enjoyment.\nIt is sometimes said of sport\nthat it gets rid of aggression by\nbeing aggressive and sexual\ndesires are got rid of by pornography (especially if violent it\nseems). From reports of violent\nfootball crowds this may seem\nimprobable, but as those are\nminorities they are not really an\nargument against this idea. For\nthe majority, who play and\npresumably those who watch,\nenjoy the competition and skill\nrather than beating hell out of\neach other. yo urs sj lu r, r/y Mark Aldcrton\nEE1\nDear Martin\nThe question of the\nmale/female ratio at IC is worth\na few sentences. The reason\nthere are so few women at IC is\nbecause at school they are\nstuffed with Victorian middle-class attitudes and discouraged\nfrom studying technical subjects.\nIt has nothing to do with the\nsocial atmosphere here, of which\nthey are almost totally ignorant.\nMany other students living in\nLondon don't know what it's like at IC, so how on earth are\nhigh-school girls from the\nMidlands expected to know? The\nMines Review is a symptom of\nthe ratio at IC, and cannot\nplausibly be advanced as a cause.\nYours\nJeff Fowler\nChem Eng 4\nPompous, I? Dear Martin\nI write to express my deep\nconcern at Mr Farzi Deravi's letter in the last issue of FELIX.\nIt is a letter the style of which\nis indicative of those who wish to\nreduce issues of political decision-making to the level of personal\nabuse.\nAfter lengthy discussion the\nExecutive Committee unanimously decided to remove some\nposters; posters that depicted\nmutilated corpses with the\nheadline 'Zionist Atrocities in\nLebanon', posters which the\nIslamic Society agreed not to use\nat Freshers' Fair, considered by\nthe Executive to be an unnecessarily sensational way in\nwhich to express a point of view.\nTo allege that members of the\nExecutive are psychotic (suf-fe ring from a severe mental\nderangement of personality)\nclearly constitutes a libel, therefore should such allegations\nbe repeated appropriate action\nwill be taken.\nIf people think their views are\nenhanced by surrounding them\nwith such defamatory statements\nthen, I am afraid, they are sadly\nmistaken.\nPower brings responsibility. It\nwould be shamefully irresponsible if I were to permit this\nUnion to become the venue for\nthe tyranny of mindless fanaticism./ remain, sir, yours sincerely\nStephen Goulder\nPresident of Imperial College\nUnion\n\u2022February 4,19831\nDear Martin\n1 am writing to inform your\nreaders that I was a witness to an\nincident similar to that described\nin one of last week's letters. A number of posters that depicted\nthe massacre of civilians in\nLebanon, displayed by the\nHellenic Society, were removed\nby Mr Goulder on the grounds\nthat they were 'sensational'.\n'Freedom of expression' was\nthe argument used by many\nintelligent people, including\nmembers of the Union Exec, for\nnot banning last week's Mines\nReview. Yet. this right was quite\nblatantly violated m the incidents mentioned abo\\e. Ironically, the Human Rif cMs Week\nwas organised to show what\nabuse of power and tyranny lead\nto.\nIt must also be mentioned\nhere, that the only posters\nremoved by Mr Goulder were\nrelated to the Lebanese issue.\nOther 'sensational' posters on\ndisplay in the JCR were not\naffected.\nYours faithful!)\nH Qudi\nScrum Down\nSir\nI observed with interest at the\nU GM the antics of the Mines\nblock vote. Cheers, jeers,\napplause and cat-calls all to\norder. Further. R SMU football\nand rugby training was cancelled\nspecially. And what was the\npublicised purpose of this\nmindless unanimity? The defence\nof the rights of the individual!\nYours in doubt\nAndy Wood\nMech Eng 3\nDear Sir\nI am issuing a challenge to the\nLeft Alliance at IC. Stand up\nand be counted at the next\nU GM. The only thing to emerge\nfrom the farce that purported to\ndemocracy on Tuesday was that\nissues are irrelevant to Union\nPolicy: numbers are not.\nThe side with the better\nargument has no guarantee of\never being heard. The quality of\nthe speech in terms of stirring\noratory has more sway but\nabove all else, the faction with\nthe largest number of mindless\nsupporters will win the day.\nIf the Left Alliance feels it has\nany support among the students\nat IC, it must demonstrate this\nby ensuring that a large number,\nsufficient to outvote the Mines\ndelegation, appears at the next\nU GM.

Main \"courses range in price from 88p to\n\u00a32.80 and are served with chips (or boiled\npotatoes) and a choice of vegetables.\nEntrecote steak with chips and green beans\n(\u00a32.80) was fine as was the Mixed Grill (\u00a32.20).\nBest value however, must be the aforementioned Chicken Kiev at \u00a31.95 which would\nhave been good at twice the price.\nPuddings range from 35p to 60p with extra\nice cream and extra cream at 20p each.\nChocolate Gateaux with cream comes to\n80p \u2014a safe choice. Banana Split with extra ice\ncream and extra cream makes an excellent\npudding for 98p. The set dinner for around \u00a31.65 is not\nparticularly good value in that the same items\nare on the menu for a total of 5p more.\nThe extensive wine list consists entirely of\nred and white wine. Bottle \u00a32.95, half bottle\n\u00a31.50, glass 57p. Nevertheless, the red was\nsurprisingly good and one could easily pay a fiver for it elsewhere.\nThe Stockpot takes a little finding. It is at the\nSloane Street end of Basil Street which runs\nbehind Harrods. Considering that it is virtually\nthe only place around where you can choose\nfrom a wide range of dishes and still eat for less\nthan \u00a35 per head including wine, I am sure that\nyou will find it well worth the trek.\nCordon\nBleugh\nThis week, for the independents who like\npacked lunches but are bored of cheese and\npickle/ham and tomato sandwiches, here are\nsome portable Cordon Bleugh recipes.\nFirst of all, my own special recipe for baked\napples. Fry 4oz mince for a few minutes, with a little onion or garlic. Season with salt and\nfreshly milled pepper. Cut off top large eating\napple, and scoop out the insides. Stir a large\ntablespoon of lime marmalade into the mince\nand then spoon it into the apple. Bake for an\nhour in a moderate oven. This will travel well\nwrapped in foil. If you have a tupperware box\nof some sort you can make up a salad to go\nwith it. One particularly fine dressing is\ncomposed of equal parts cider vinegar, olive oil\nand black treacle, with a squirt of lemon juice.\nToss chopped sausages and cold spaghetti in\nthe mixture, drain and stir in' half a cup of cold\nstewed rhubarb.\nFinally, instead of the ubiquitous chocolate\nbiscuit or Mars bar, why not make some\nChocolate Crispies? Melt a few ounces of\nchocolate in a large bowl over a pan of boiling\nwater. Dice one carrot and one onion. Fetch a packet of cornflakes or rice cri spies and a few\nraisins. Put the vegetables into the chocolate\nwith the raisins and then stir in as much cereal\nas will go. Spoon dollops of the mixture onto a baking sheet and leave to set in the fridge or\nfreezer. The cri spies can be kept frozen until\nrequired.\nFELIX Poge9\n\n"

    "content": "Democracy in ICU\nSimon Rodan. Imperial College\nUnion's External Affairs Officer,\nhas written a letter to FELIX,\nprinted on page 2. which criticises IC students for the result of\nthe WIST motion at Tuesday's Union General Meeting, he\nargues that quality of argument\nand moving oratory counted for\nlittle, and the only influence on\nthe final result was the number\nof people in favour of one side\nover the other. 'How can this be\ndemocracy?' he asks.\nCertain members of WIST\nadvanced a similar argument.\nSurely, they said, supposing only\na handful of student.' were\nopposed to. say. racism, then the\nmajority in favour of racism\nshould not be allowed to win.\nBoth arguments are wrong.\nThe whole point of democracy\n(literally 'government by the\ncrowd') is that it consists of\nlegislating in accordance with\nthe wishes of the majority: it\ndoes not (indeed cannot) make\nexceptions when the majority are\nbiased, uninformed, stupid,\nimmoral or just plain wrong.\nAnd if a couple of hundred\nMiners choose to 'sacrifice their\nindividuality' (as was alleged)\nand vote just as Nigel Walls tells\nthem to. then the v must be\nallowed to do so. Had anyone\nforced them to support their\npresident, principles of democracy would have been violated,\nand complaints would have been\nin order. But every individual\nEDITORIAL\nmember of the Royal School of\nMines was entitled to vote\naccording to his or her con-science, and the fact that enough\nof them felt so strongly about\nthe motion that they were\nprepared to show up in force is\nperfectly in or dei, anu there is\nlittle point in anybody complain-ing.\nDemocracy is far from ideal as\na system of government and it\nhas many weakness ness. notably\nthe majority often have little\nidea what is best for them, but it\nis generally acknowledged in the\nWestern world to have fewer and\nless serious weaknesses than\nother forms of government, and\nuntil someone comes up with\nsomething better, democracy\nwill have to serve as best it can.\nThis said, there are certain\nprerequisites for a meeting to be\nrun democratically, some of\nwhich came dangerously close to\nbeing broken on Tuesday.\nIt is obvious that when a vote\nis taken, the votes must be\ncounted fairly and accurately,\nyet the tellers were so badly\norganised on Tuesday that\nduring the first card vote whole\nblocks of seats were counted\ntwice, and even after the second\ncard vote the final result was\nannounced prematurely, and\nmany people are still under the\nimpression that the motion was\nonly defeated by six votes. When\nthe hall is as packed as it was on\nTuesday, it is essential for the\nUnion officers to divide the\naudience into separate blocks so\nthat each section can be carefully\ncounted by the tellers. The\nChairman should then collect all\nthe figures together, check that\nhe has been given the totals for\nall parts of the hall, and then and\nonly then give them to the Union\nAdministrator for adding up.\nThere is no point in having a card vote at all if the counting is\nthe mad scramble it became on\nTuesday.\nWindow Cleaning \u2014 The Final\nInstalment\nThe window cleaners who were\nemployed to clean Southside\nhave now finished and been\npaid, so it is now safe to leave\nyour wardrobes unlocked again.\nPresumably the reason so many\nrooms didn't have their windows\ncleaned is that it was necessary\nto conserve water.\nLate Notices\nMichael Arthur has asked me to\ninform you of a vacancy for a student (preferably writing up)\nto man a hotel reception desk\nduring the day. Almost no actual\nwork is involved, as the job\nmainly involves just being there.\nRemuneration is negotiable.\nContact Student Services for\ndetails. v After last Tuesday'sU GMa yellow rucksack, a squash\nracket, and a Unichem bag\ncontaining hair care products\nwere found in the Great Hall.\nThey may be claimed from the\nUnion Office.\nFinally, may I remind you\nthat next Friday is the nearest to\nValentine's Day, and seasonal\nsmall ads must be in by Monday\n5:30pm.

For\nStephen is becoming regularly\nparanoid that sooner or later\nsomeone is going to propose an\nemergency motion of no confidence in him. At the last two or\nthree UGMs, he has been quite\ncertain that he was due to be 'no\nconfide n ccd'. This week, for\nreasons about to be explained,\nhe actually went so far as to\nwrite a speech opposing the nonexistent motion. It came about\nlike this.\nOn Monday afternoon, the\nday before the meeting. Martin\nTaylor visited John McCallion\nin the Unic n Office. Since the\nsubject of lis visit was rather\nsensitive, Martin didn't want all\nthe world and his dog to\noverhear and so he asked John if\nthey could talk privately in his\noffice. The effect on Stephen\nFELIX\nBELOW\nGoulder was remarkable: he\nI visibly paled and as soon as\nMartin and John had left, went\ninto his own office and spent the\nnext ive minutes with his car to\nthe door hoping to overhear the\ndetails of what must surely be\ntreasonous plans to overthrow\nthe President.\nUnfortunately John and\nMartin are well aware of\nStephen's fears and suspected he\nmight be listening in. and so they\nstifle J giggles and fabricated a perfectly serious conversation\nabout whether Nick Pyne would\naccept the motion, and whether\nStephen had found out about it,\nand whether the U GM would\nvote against him or not.\nWhen the misc he vio us pair\nleft the office later, Stephen's face had turned from white to\ngrey, and later that evening he\nactually left the bar early to\ny HH HB HH BH February\niii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii i11II III NUI III III IL III TI II;I1~1 Il\"l~ il TI l \u2122\nIIII III1 \u2022 III1 III III~1 If I \u00bb I1 \u2022 \u2022 Il\" II \u2022 l~i ii_i\"i rrr i\"i\"i~ i~i\"i\" r ri\"r allow himself time to prepare an\nopposing speech. As if anyone\nwould bring themselves to speak\nagainst such a well-loved and\nhard-working President!\nCONSIDERING THAT writing\na music review allows such\nwonderful potential for venomous insults, one cannot fail to\nbe impressed at the benevolent\ntact of IC Orchestra's former\nleader David Bogle, particularly\nsince the object of his criticism is\nthe widely-disliked Warden Don\nMonro.\nDon is conductor of the\nConsort Chamber Orchestra,\nknown rather less pretentiously\nas String Band, and reading\nbetween the lines of Criticon's review of their last concert, Mr Bogle is less than impressed with\nDon's contacting.\nYet he is so polite about it all.\n'Don Monro would be the first\nto point OIM that he is learning\nhis conducting technique' he\n4 1983 HH HH B WH H writes. Isn't that so much more\ngenteel than saying that Don\nhasn't got a clue about conducting and is in considerable\ndoubt over which end of the\nbaton he should hold.\nDID YOU NOTICE the openings of the first few paragraphs\nof the report Stephen Goulder\nsubmitted to the U GM? 'Hopefully everybody will\nhave read the article in FELIX...\n'As reported in FELIX...' >\nThe concern held by many of\nus, and voiced by Martin Taylor\nin FELIX' How gratifying to know that\nour Executive take the Union\nnewspaper so seriously!\nAND FINALLY, next week I 'll\nbe announcing the results of the\nET lookalike competition: any\nlast minute entries?\nI Page5\n\n"

For myself, I enjoy these\ntimes when work which one should\nbe doing goes by the board (bored?)\nanyway, and when one pulls out all\nthe stops and stops which one never\nknew even existed. In my first year\nat Garden Hall I organised events: a party with plenty of food and drink\nto which nobody came, and herbal\ntea-tasting sessions (a whimsical\nexperiment which was certainly\nfunny...nobody came to them\neither). BUT we had lunch together\non Sunday, a walk in the park und a visit to the theatre. Our Contact\nWeek person was a nun, which is\nsomeone you don't get to talk to\nevery day of your life. I was\nsurprised to discover that she didn't think Christianity was the only true\nreligion. Other Contact Week\nvisitors include religious deep-thinkers, theological students,\ndeacons and deaconesses, priests\nand vicars (hence last year's expression 'Knickers to vicars,\nNuns are more fun').\nContact Week is the biggest event\nof the West London Chaplaincy.\nPeople from many and varied\nreligious walks of life come from\nnear and far to Imperial College and\nelsewhere.

The\ngroups meet more often than usual,\nsometimes once a day or more, and\nthereby get to know each other\nbetter. The aims of the Week are\nthus: (1) to de vel on the life of each\ngroup and bring in fresh ideas; (2) to\ncontact or re-contact ot tier people\nin the hall or department; and (3) to\ntalk individually to a mature\nChristian with a different religious\noutlook on life.

    "content": "continued from page two\nWater Water\nEverywhere....,\nDear Martin\n| I have been disappointed (if\nnot surprised) by the reaction of\nyour correspondents and yourself to the College Secretary's directive on water usage. It\nseems incredible that in a college of such a strong scientific\nand engineering these people\nshow so little understanding of\nthe problems, efforts being\nconcentrated in a campaign to\nmalign John Smith. I would like\nto challenge the points raised in\nlast week's FELIX. The directive of John Smith,\nto fill baths with cold water by\nSunday noon, was, as reported\nin FELIX, issued on Friday. The\nappeals by the water authority\nnot to hoard water were not\nbroadcast till after this time, and\nI myself recall none before\nMonday morning. Mr Smith\nacted perfectly correctly.\nFurther criticisms of Mr Smith said the measures were\nunnecessary and ineffective. I am now reading for the MSc in\nEngineering Hydrology (Water\nEngineering) but my argument\ndoes not require tiny vast hydraulic understanding, rather CSE\nphysics would suffice. I am\nsurprised since most IC students\nmust have at least O Level\nphysics at the total misapprehension shown, even by you, the\nwise old Editor of FELIX. You\nWrote most profusely in a 'monumentally asinine' (sic) way\nthat we will suffer no harm\nunless the Kensington/Chelsea\n'and Westminster pumping stations fail. Quite rightly you\nstated \"It's highly unlikely that\nboth of these will fail simultaneously\" and the front page\narticle that a breakdown is\n\" unlikely unless the strike\ncontinues for several weeks\".\nPump failures are of minor,\nrelevance, the worry is of failed\nwater mains.\nLet me spell this out in\n' Mickey Mouse' style. The\nsupply of water to buildings and\nhigh places is dependent on the\nmain ten ace of pressure in the\ndistribution system. Burst pipes\nrelease the pressure maintained\nby pumping, so water will not\nflow uphill to our roof tops and\ntanks.\nI am sure that the residents of\nthe top floors of Southisde,\nNorthisde and all other College\nresidences are well aware that\nthey are a long way above\nground, and that the water tanks \u2022\nare above their heads. It is\nprecisely these tall buildings\nwhich will be affected first by a pressure loss. The residents of\nthese buildings will lose their\nsupply (even if they do have O level physics). Incidentally,\nseveral burst mains have oc-cur red, one in Fulham Road.\nI support Mr Smith's directive\nand believe it shows a degree of\nforethought not attained by the\ncorrespondents, editor and\nreporters of FELIX. With reference to the garbage\n(as normal) scribbled by Paul\nSimion (who gets a high quota of\nmentions), the directive was that\nthe stored water is for flushing\ntoilets. Mr Smith did not\n(unfortunately) instruct you to\ndrink it Paul. We don't need\nsterile water to flush our loos.\nI am sure that such an important resident of Bernard\nSunley House can prevent his\nco-habitants from dipping their\ntoes in the stored water; is\ncapable of finding a low lying\nlaunder et te and washing from a sink. Further I'm sure that a man of such authority and\ncleanliness can wash a bath, but\nas I said the cleanliness of the\nwater is unimportant.\nFinally, window cleaners\ndon't use much water, certainly\nless than a few bath fulls (and\nwho's been complaining about\ndirty windows?) and I wasn't aware many IC students bathed\nvery regularly anyway.\nYours odour less lyC P Bardsley\nPS: What as lagging Mr Smith\nwould have had with no directive and no water!\nWhat Strike? Page 41\nDear Martin\nI must clarify the situation\nconcerning the proposed Bernard\nSunley House rent strike as\nreported in your January 28\nissue. Your article, although it\nattempted to be objective, lacked\nthe accuracy that we have come\nto expect from FELIX. I think\nthis is due to your use of Paul\nSimion as a major source. In fact\nit was unwise to trust his version\nof events as he has political\nmotives (ie his desire to be\nelected U GM Chairman this\nyear). Your article lays the\nblame quite firmly upon STOIC\nwhereas we both know that\nSTOIC reports, not incites, the\nnews.\nOn Saturday 22 Mr Simion\ntold me that he was thinking of\norganising a rent strike and\nwould he get STOIC coverage.\nWith an eye for a scoop I HHS IMH HH MH February 4,1983\nconsulted my superiors who said\n'cover it in case it happens'. On\nSunday the cameras took shots\nof the outside of Bernard Sunley\nand the offending interior. WE are unable to get the wardens'\nreaction because Mr Simion\nrefused to tell him that he was\norganising a rent strike in case\nthe Warden quo shed it. He then\ncalled together a proportion of\nthe house committee who agreed\nto withhold their rent until the\n31st but were puzzled that Mr\nSimion did not know how to\norganise a rent strike despite his\ndesire to be seen as a man of the\npeople, fighting for the downtrodden student. Apparently he\nasked Mr Gould er how to\norganise a rent strike but was\nadvised that as it would fail it\nwould be political suicide. So by\nlate on Tuesday night Mr Simion\npointed out to me that he had\nnever had anything to do with a rent strike, had never heard of\none and never wanted to be\nconnected with one. On Wednesday STOIC was requested to\nwithhold the item on the grounds\nthat FELIX had agreed not to\nprint it either (obviously a figment of Simion'sima gina tion). WE agreed on the grounds\nthat no strike equals no news.\nThe strangest thing is that\ndespite Mr Simi on telling\nSTOIC, FELIX and Mr Goulder, he failed to inform the sub-wardens, the warden: Nick\nCampbell, or anyone from\nCollege. The warden knew\nnothing about it until questioned\nby FELIX and his reaction to\nme when I told him what was\ngoing on was that it was just an\nattempt to further the political\ncareer of a certain member of the\nhouse.\nMr Simion, the man who\nrequested that STOIC support\nhim in his campaign to be\nPresident in 1985 (despite the\nfact that we are constitutionally\nforbidden to do so) then attacked\nSTOIC for sensationalism even\nthough we did not mention the\nnon-event until February 3 and\nthen only in our defence. He has\nsince attacked the idea of a rent\nstrike, his own idea. This begs\nthe question\u2014is a man who\nstands for one thing and then\nfalls in with the people he is\nattacking a man suitable to hold\na Union office never mind the\nseven committee seats that he is\nrumoured to hold in ICU and\nUL U. It will be a sad day for the\nUnion if Mr Simion is elected\nU GM Chairman or even President as he hopes. No, Mr Simion, you are to blame\u2014not\nSTOIC. The only thing that we\ndid wrong was to enter the house\nwithout the Warden's permission\nand he has accepted our apology.\nWhat right have you to attack\nsuch a popular and hard working\nwarden as Nick Campbell?\nYours objectively\nRichard Copnall\nDear Sir\nWe feel obliged to correct\nyour article in last week's FELIX( no 634) about a supposed rent strike in Bernard\nSunley House. You stated,\nincorrectly, that there are only\nten cooking rings to serve 108\npeople. In fact, Mr Simion,\nwhom you quoted, was referring\nto only one of the four kitchens\nin the house. Only one bathroom\nin the house is in the condition\nthat you described and this is\ndue for re decoration. The members of the House\nCommittee who convened the\noriginal meeting now realise that\ntheir action was ill-advised and\nregret that the whole matter got\nout of hand. Bernard Sunley\nHouse, in common with the\nother student houses in Evelyn\nGardens, has a well-established\nprocedure for attending to\ngeneral repairs and main ten ace. We feel that this is able to cope\nwith any demands made upon it.\nThe House Committee wishes\nto make it clear that rumours of\na rent strike in Bernard Sunley\nHouse are unfounded.\nYours faithfully\nBernard Sunley House\nCommittee\nSmall Beer\nDear Editor\nI am writing you in the hopes\nthat you could publish the article\nfollowing, to advertise a new\nsociety which is just in the\nprocess of getting officially\naf filli a ted to Imperial College.\n\"Imperial College Brewing\nSociety is a new club, trying to\nget officially recognised by IC\nUnion (already 20 members).

The anti-porn crusader holds\nhands with a TV star outside Friday's review.\nThe controversial RSM Review\nwas picketed by over one hundred\nmembers of WIST and various\ncollege religious societies last\nFriday.\nSeveral other London colleges,\nincluding the RCA and the\nLondon School of Economics,\nwere represented on the picket\nwhich was peaceful and not\nintended to prevent people\nentering the Review.\nWIST had announced at their\npreliminary meeting that they\nwere not concerned so much to\nstop pornography generally, as\nin Soho, but to stop it in IC.\nThey were worried that women\nstudents would be put off from\njoining IC, which is why WIST\nput forward a motion in Tuesday'sU GM. Some students were noticeably put off entering, and felt it\nwas necessary to enter the review\nin large groups. No police\nattended the picket, but several\nIC security guards were ob-serving.\nAfter the male strip-tease act,\nthe transvestite com per e came\nout to chat with some of the\nprotesters, including Michael\nNewman. S/ he considered that\nthe men who went into their\nshow of their own accord\nenjoyed it just for the fun it was,\nand so it was not capable of\nstirring men to rape. S/ he\nclaimed to see herself as a mother figure to the strippers in\ntheir everyday problems of\nsupporting family and children.\nU GM SANCTIONS SMUT would close the meeting unless it\nbecame more orderly. This\nprovoked more rowdiness until\nthe Miners shut up at a gesture\nThe motion on sexually explicit\nevents on Union premises was\nheavily defeated at Tuesday's UGM, largely because of several\nhundred Miners who were there\nspecifically to vote against it.\nAfter much discussion, it was\nproposed that the motion on\nsexually explicit events on Union\npremises be voted on first.\nLouise McKeown of WIST\nstated, against cat-calls, that\npornography serves to divide\nsociety in Imperial College.\nPornography is a mockery of\nhuman sexuality, and to thus\ndegrade human beings was an\nunhealthy form of amusement,\nshe said.\nNigel Walls, R SMU President,\nreplied that the motion was\nagainst our rights, as intelligent\nNo. 6 3 5 HH H^MMm consenting adults, to what we\nwant to do. He saw the Review,\nin particular, as good harmless\nfun that wasn't meant to be\nserious.\nSumming up for the motion\nHugh Southey stated that events\nlike the Mines Review discouraged women from attending\nIC. He added that those complaining about the poor male/\nfemale ratio should do something about it and not support\nevents which ensured the numbers of women remained low.\nAfter more dissension, Gaynor\nLewis of RS M also spoke against\nthe motion. At one point shouts\nfrom the audience threatened to\ndrown out the speakers com-p let ely, whereupon the Chairman Nick Pyne announced he Ages ti cula tory Nigel Walls\nI Friday, February 4,19831\nfrom Nigel Walls.\nThe motion was defeated by\n463 votes to 297.\nOther items on the agenda\nwere dealt with more summarily.\nThe motion to ban all Imperial\nCollege ties with South Africa,\nwas again met with heckling\nfrom the Miners. David Hodes\nstopped during the reading of his\nmotion, to say that he was trying\nto exercise freedom of speech\nrights that were denied to him in\nSouth Africa.\nA spokesman from R SMU said it would take years to\ninvestigate Imperial College's connections with South Africa,\nand that it would be 'pretty\nstupid' to pass this motion,\nalthough several Union members felt that RS M had a vested\ninterest, as RSM depends heavily\non its contacts with South\nAfrica, and it probably employs\n50% of RS M graduates.\nTwo votes had to be called\nfor, and the motion was defeated\nby 264 votes to 233.\nkW I HUM H Free\n\n"

The club\nneeds a good turn-out on\nFebruary 23 for the last L CL race, so, see you there.\nVolleyball\nIn this exciting episode of the\nSpiker's Saga I have the pleasure\nto present a new competition,\nthe score of last week's match, a new high in volleyball ing sartorial splendour, and an apology\nof truly grovelling dimensions!\nFirst the scores\u2014last week the\njet-setting first team voyaged to\nWatford and for the second time\nthis season beat the upstart\nnortherners, though for some\nunaccountable reason we lost\nthe first set. Final score 6-15, 15-3, 15-12, 15-2, exit Watford.\nOn the way up we held an\nofficial Club Meeting, and this is\nwhere the competition (nay,\nchallenge) comes in I CV BC claims the record for holding an\nAthletics Club General Meeting\nin the most unusual place: the\nback ot an ICU transit van doing\n70mph up the Ml. Any club who\nthinks it can outdo that are\nwelcome to try. If they win, they\ncan buy us all a drink for being\nthe first.\nNow folks, it's cringe time. In\nmy article of two weeks ago, I put in an appeal for Greekspeaking Barry Manilow fans to\ncontact one of our members.\nUnfortunately I forgot to specify\nthat these poor people must be\nexclusively female, and un savoury conclusions appear to\nhave been drawn by certain\nreactionary elements. Anyway, if\nI gave offence or caused suffer-ing, my humble apologies\nChristos (please let go of my\narm), it was only meant as a joke.\nIC vs Kingston 59-78\nOn Monday evening a well\ndisciplined Kingston team\nplayed us in a hard fought\nmatch. At half time we were five\npoints behind with everything to\nplay for, but the beginning of the\nsecond half saw us drop further\nbehind until eventually the task\nwas too much , and we lost 59-78.\nIC vs Ealing 70-62\nThe following night we travelled\nout to Ealing with five players\nto a match that had the prospect\nof being a farce since they so\nobviously outclassed us.\nThe final result may have been\na shock but it was certainly well\nearned. Once settled our defence\nwas tight and throughout the\ngame patient build-ups saw our\nscore tick over nicely. Their\ngreater experience probably won\nthem the game.\nIC2 vs BSOl 1-4\nIC3 vs Bed C05 IC4 vs City 2 3-2\nOur first win this term! While I hope there are many more like it,\nit's difficult to envisage any great\nsuccesses for as long as IC students continue to drop like\nflies in the spring term w nen the\nprospect of finals looms that bit\ncloser. Do other sports clubs\nsuffer similar selection problems?\nOn a lighter note, four members saw seventeen-year-old\nSohail Quasir, Pakistan, bt r.t Greg Gurkin, Australia, 3 i ro\nwin the 3M British Open Squash\nChampionship at Wembley last\nFriday, and learnt a thing or two\nin the the process!\nPaderborn Tourist Office\n(Germany) have written and\nhave set one of their young\nladies to work on our behalf (!).\nMeanwhile Newnham College,\nCambridge, thanked us for our\nchallenge but pointed out that\ntheirs was an all-female college!\n1C vs UC 10-1\nHere's another lengthy report to\nfill out the space so that Chess\nClub won't get a look in.\nThe IC machine rolled into\naction against UC in the semifinal of the KO Cup. Pre-match\ntraining the previous evening by\ntwo of the men proved its worth,\nwith exemplary performances by\nyour resident transvestite com per e, Zombie Willis, and\nmale stripper on roller skates,\nIan 'who says you.can't play\nwhilst still drunk' Bull.\nHuff Chrisslet and the club\nn utter, Dominic, taunted the\nopposition with a series of outer\nMongolian War chants, numerous mis hits and the occasional\nburst of poetry.\nOn the other hand, the ladies\nproved that soft toilet paper in\nthe ladies only can reap generous\nrewards! They took UC ladies to\nthe cleaners in the Jaffa cake\neating contest, and just to rub it\nin also outshone them at bad-minton.\nAnyway, to sum up, IC won\n10-1, and this very strong team\ngoes on into the final.\nFirsts\nIC vs Borough Road 11-0\nA smartly turned out (interview\nsuits predominant) IC 1st XV arrived at Borough Road expecting a hard game in one of our\ntop College fixtures. Two years'\npreviously we received a good\nfifty points thrashing. However,\nit was soon evident that our\nteam, especially the forwards,\nwere more than a match for our\nopposition. The first half saw IC\nalways permanently entrenched\nin the Borough Road 22. Un fortunately, due to some rather\nhurried play, most of the good\npossession was wasted and the\nonly score was a penalty by Paul\nBarker. Fortunately, the second\nhalf saw IC continue in good\nform, dominating up front. In\nscrum, line out and loose and\nthis was soon rewarded with an\nexcellent push-over try from a five yard scrum, scored by Stuart\nJohns. The backs stifled the\nopposition effectively throughout the game and showed their\nopportunity when Alastair Davies broke a tackle to score in\nthe corner after good work from\nthe forwards. In the latter stages\nof the game, the PE college's fitness began to tell, but resolute\n.defence kept them out.\nFirsts\nIC vs Thames Valley 6-0\nAn IC 1st XI playing with only\nten men, pulled off a fine\nli c tory \u2014largely attributable to\nthe team's international flavour.\nMargaret Pencil (fried yam with\ncoconut) and Geoff Graces (leak\nsoup) scoring five of the six\ngoals.\nDespite Graces opening up an\nold sickle wound early on and\ntemporarily reducing IC to nine\nmen, the defence remained\nrelatively sound with keeper\nCasey only suffering a mild\nstroke instead of the usual heart\nattack. A much relieved D Roosevelt (the only member of\nthe team with a Blue Peter badge\nfor mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) was thus saved from\nhaving to administer the kiss of\nlife for the fourth successive\nweek.\nThe highlight of the game\ncame when Casey was overcome\nby an attack of spontaneous\nlaughter and collapsed in a heap\nwhile saving a penalty flick.\nSeconds\nIC vs Amersham 1-0\nIt seemed a fruitless vi\nOne-nil down within a minute\nDuncan had a tussle\nWith a man made of muscle\nNick had a chance, but did miss\nit\nPerhaps Amersham were ruthless\nAnyway our attempts seemed\nuseless\nBut in the after-match raffle\nJim won a pineapple\nSo our visit proved not to be\nfruitless\nFELIX February 4,1983 Page13\n\n"

If you\nremember, British Rail were running a direct\nroute from Killinbuckton to Higher Pay rise,\nbut were having trouble turning the train\nround at Killinbuckton. Now, having found this\nroute quite popular, they've decided to add\nanother restaurant car, to make sure everyone\ngets fed up with the journey. Sir Peter CarrParker-Tendant has deemed that this shall go\nwith the other restaurant car.\nThe problem, then, is this:\n1. The train arrives from Higher Payrise in\nthe order: locomotive, second class coach,\nrestaurant car, restaurant car, Pullman car; it\nmust leave in the same order, but facing in the\nopposite direction.\n2. The locomotive and the Pullman car\nmust have been turned around when they\nleave, the two restaurant cars and the second\nclass coach need not be.\n3. There is no ordering to the restaurant\ncars; they may leave in any order.\n4. Killinbuckton is entirely flat, hence no\nrolling of vehicles is allowed.\n5. Nothing can move without being coupled\nto the locomotive.\n6. Nothing can move round an acute angle.\n7. Everything must be at a standstill for\ncoupling or uncoupling to take place (no\n'pushing').\n8. The locomotive can move in both\ndirections.\n9. The figures indicate how many vehicles\nwill fit in each section of track.\nWhat is the minimum number of moves\nrequired to turn the train (the first move starts\nwith the train standing on the line from Higher\nPayrise; a move ends whenever the locomotive\nhas to stop for coupling, uncoupling or a change of direction)?

Apparently, 'latch strings 'Is hyphenated in Chambers\n20th Century Dictionary and Scaramouche\nsuggests a i at ch springs as the longest two-vowel, two-syllable word: however, looking in\nmy Collins English Dictionary, I found that\n/at ch strings was all one word, and uva tch springs does not feature at all. Over to you,\nScaramouche!\nmi: There are 27 lines Iff: to be completed, of\nwhich 15 will earn a player a no in er line by\ncompleting a box. So assuming no line\ncompletes two boxes simultaneously, there\nare twelve turns left in the game, which means\nthat since it is your turn to play, your opponent\nwill have the critical last move fas explained\nlast week). But every line which completes two\nboxes (a 'double-cross') will wu sie precisely\none move, so your strategy is therefore to\nensure there are an odd number of double-cross moves played. Now I explained last week\nthat every long chain except the last will result\nin a double-cross (when the two-square\nsacrifice is mad p to gain control of the next\nchain) so you must aim for an even number of\nlong chains. In the diagram, the area\nimmediately above the centre line is already a long chain, and the a iea immediately below it\nwill develop into on'i very soon. The two\nsquares in the bottom left hand corner cannot\nform a long chain, so you must prevent your\nopponent making the group of three in the top\nleft into a long chain. He can do this next move\nby playing horizontally from the top left hand\ndot and the only way you can prevent this\nwithout allowing him to force another double-cross is to play the double line shown in the\ndiagram, sacrificing two squares.\nSUMMER VACATION WORK\nThe School Examinations Department of the University of London has vacancies\nfor Seasonal Temporary Clerks to check school examinations and computer\ndocuments.\nStarting Date: At weekly intervals from 23 May to 4 July.\nDuration: Until the middle of August in most cases.\nHours: 9:30am to 5:30pm, Monday to Friday.\nWages: \u00a365.00 per week (under review)\nNB: Income tax is not deducted in the case of students returning to university/polytechnic after the vacation.\nAppointments are made subject to satisfactory interview.\nInterviews will be held during the following weeks: 21-30 March and 6-8 April.\nNB: The University is unable to accept responsibility for travelling expenses or for finding\naccommodation for students whose homes are not within travelling distance of London.\nFor further details and an application form ring Miss J A Slater, Assistant Personnel Officer,\nSchool Examinations Department, on 01-636 8000 ext 4050 as soon as possible.\nClosing date for applications: 4 March 1983.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of ImperiatCollegeUmonPublications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

    "content": "Airplane II - the sequel, now playing at\nthe Plaza, Lower Regent Street.\nYou thought this column was becoming far\ntoo high brow didn't you? Some bloody\npseudo-intellectual little fart going on about the\nprecise nuance of some obscure film of a lesbian workers co-operative in Cambodia\nfilmed in grain-o vision by a one-armed dyslexic eight-year-old. Well, this week it's let your\nhair down time. Nothing particularly subtle\nabout this one, it's just a good laugh.\nIf you've seen Airplane, then this film won't contain any surprises. The cast is virtually\nidentical, even down to the little boy who gets\nto chat to the pervert Captain Oveur on the\nflight deck. The gags come thick and fast and\nare as corny as ever; it definitely justifies a second viewing just to get all the clever bits\nyou missed first time round while you were\nbusy ch cu kling at the last bit of lunacy.\nBut this isn't just a bit of exploitation to cash\nin on the unexpected success of Airplane; I suppose that's part of the joke, you are\nparodying the sequel which just rips off the\npunter by reworking the same threadbare plot\nin a slightly new guise; this film finds a whole\nnew vista of unexplored hokum to demolish.\nContent in the knowledge that no self-respecting director will ever make an Airport\neighty-wat ever, the merciless satirical gaze is\ncast on the world of sci-fi. As demonstrated by\nHREVIEWSU\nthe classic Dark Star and somewhat less\nmemorably in Flesh Cordon, this is a rich field,\nmerely waiting for the death blow to demolish\nthe facade of respectability that SF has\nsomehow managed to build around itself.\nThe film is set on the first shuttle taking\ncolonists to the moon. Almost gratuitously, a quick jibe is taken at Toaiering Inferno as the\ncigar-chewing rough neck discovers that the\nnew ship isn't quite as safe as its cracked up to\nbe. Thus, inevitably the missions heads for\ndisaster, as the parodies come thick and fast.\nMission Impossible, 2001 and Star Trek all\nreceive their share ot the flak. William Shatnci\nmakes a brilliant contribution as the manic\nmoon-base commander, a total change from\nthe ice cool woman is er boldly going nowhere.\nIt is assumed that Lloyd Bridges manages to\ncure his glue addiction from Airplane and\nmakes a come back to talk our hero 'Striker' in\nto land. This time Striker not only has to cope\nwith the memory of his ill-fated Vietnam mission but also has his crack-up as a shuttle\ntest pilot on his mind. But despite impossible\nodds, he brings her in, the wind (on the moon!)\nwhistling through his hair.\nWell, I really enjoyed this film, and I hope\nyou will too. One tip: remain rooted to your\nseat as the credits roll, or you'll miss a real gem\ndelivered by William Shatner right at the end.\nI would use this column to remind you that\nEnts arc showing my all-time fave film on\nThursday, The Tin Drum (well, should be the\nkiss of death to death), but since you won't be\nseeing this till Friday, what's the point. If you\nsaw it, you'll have you're own opinion, if not,\ntough. Ents really seem to be trying hard this\nterm with a pretty good line up. More power to\nyour various elbows lads, but don't forget to\npay for them this time!\nAnd don't think just because you live out in\nthe wilds of inter-collegiate halls that you're\nbadly off. The Scala in Pentonville Road is well\nworth a visit. There's a different film every day\nand all-night ers on Saturday. If you want to\nknow what's on. there's a programme in the\nFELIX Office Atter the film, why not check\nout the local night-life.

    "content": "IREVIEWSI\nOpium for Tea\nPoppy by Peter Nichols with music by\nMonty Norman, directed by Terry Hands,\nRoyal Shakespeare Company at the\nBarbican Theatre.\nThe first new play to be seen in the Barbican\nTheatre, Poppy is a splendid affair. It is a pantomime and a musical in the Victorian\nfashion. The play boasts quite an impressive\npedigree. Peter Nichols is a very talented\nplaywright, and Poppy is his third work to be\npremiered by the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany, the others being Passion Play and\nPrivates on Parade, both major award\nwinners. And Monty Norman, who wrote the\nmusic, holds many stage musicals and film\nscores to his credit. His most famous film\nscore is Dr No, from which the James Bond\ntheme became the famous signature tune for\nall the Bond movies.\nPerhaps the Victorian's most favourite\npastime was pantomime. But pantomime in\nthose days was much more political than is\ncommonly realised. Nichols has hit upon the\nbrilliant idea of staging a Victorian pantomime\nabout the Victorian's favourite occupation:\nimperialism. A superb joke is therefore made\nat the expense of the Victorians and their\nvalues.\nMany of the traditional pantomime\ncharacters fill the cast. There is a Jack Idle\n(Stephen Moore) and his pan to horse, and\nSally Forth, a schoolmistress (played by Julia\nHills) and Cherry her pan to mare. Dick\nWhittington, the squire, is played by Geraldine\nGardner, a young lady with superb legs. But by\nfar and away the funniest character is Lady\nDodo, the\" dowager Lady Whittington, played\nby the RSC's resident clown, Geoffrey\nHutchings. This man in drag stole the\nshow\u2014his impersonation was truly inspired\nand comic.\nThese characters meet up with Obadiah\nUpwards a London merchant played by\nBernard Lloyd. They set off for India and\nChina to make their fortune.\nThe play opens with a greeting by the\nEmperor of China. Tao-Kuan, played\namusingly by Tony Church. Queen Victoria\n(Jane Carr), the Fairy Queen would you\nbelieve, appears as if by magic, and at once the\ntwo are at loggerheads. For although Poppy is\na comedy and a musical, its subject matter is\nessentially serious. It is about yet another\nhorrifying and profoundly embarrassing period\nof English history; the mid-19th Century opium\nwars. Poppy charts the Victorian hypocrisy of\na foreign war waged solely to ensure that\nChina remained addicted to opium, the single\nmost profitable export of the British East India\nCompany. Victorian morals are shown to be\nnothing but hypocritical.\nIt all started when opium was traded for tea\nand silk. Very soon the British Empire became\nthe world's largest grower, processor and\nexporter of opium. It was grown in India but\nChina was its main market. The English\nfostered addiction in China and by the 1840s, ten to twelve million inhabitants were addicted.\nTo the grave consternation of the English, the\nChinese Emperor started to stamp out the\ntrade. A fleet of gunboats was promptly sent\ndown to defend the profits, thereby starting\nthe Opium Wars of 1839-42. In the words of\nLord Palmerston, Queen Victoria's Foreign\nSecretary 'these half-civilised governments\nsuch as those in China, Portugal and Spanish\nAmerica all require a dressing down every 8or10 Chinese court scene in RSC's 'Poppy'.\nyears to keep them in order'. David Whitaker's portrayal of Palmerston in the play is the\nfunniest thing 1 have seen for months. He is\nperched like a ventriloquist's dummy on the\nknee of the merchant Upward, and through\nhim Upward mouths his demands for free\ntrade and new markets. Palmerston orders the\ndispatch of a task force with the Cutty Sark as\ntroop carrier.\nBy the treaty which followed, Britain gained\nHong Kong, a secure future for the Poppy\ntrade with trading ports up and down the\ncoast. But the musical takes us past the end of\nthe Opium Wars to a period twenty years later\nwhen the British tried to ratify a treaty which\nthe Chinese refused to comply with. A combined Anglo-French force of 18,000\ndestroyed the Chinese navy and military forts.\nThe Emperor's Summer Palace, repository of\nan ancient civilisation, was looted of its\nprecious treasures and burned. Centuries of\nChinese tradition, the epi to my of their culture,\nthe Versailles of the East, were destroyed in\ntwo days.\nThe export of opium tripled over the next\ntwenty years. The trade was diversified but still\nsurvives today. Hong Kong is one of the focal\npoints for the world's supply of opium en route\nfrom Burma, Thailand and Laos to the\nexpanding markets of the Third World. The\nislanders are also today among the world's most avid users. Opium was officially banned\nin 1896 but now changes hands as its less\ndetectable derivative Heroin No. 3. What is\nnot used by the residents is exported to Japan\nand the States. The Great British legacy of\nunbridled free trade survives.\nThe RSC's product i>n involves much\naudience participation (we are all referred to as\n'boys and girls') and ad lib bing. The designs\nand costumes are sumptuous and the music and\nlyrics catchy. Two particularly good numbers\nare The Blessed Trinity (the three Cs:\ncivilisation, commerce, Christianity) and The\nBounty of the EarHi ,.\\ng by Queen Victoria!\nPoppy is a tasteful treatment of a very serious\nsubject and because i; is mixed with comedy,\nthe strong political m to sage makes a direct hit\nat the audience's private political parts. It is\nfun, imaginative, provocative and strong in its\nmessage. In short it is theatre at its best.\nThe last performances are on March 7-9 and\nMarch 17-19. Seats are still available.\nNick Bedding\nNuclear\nCon-Fusion\nBedsitting Room II by John Antrobus and\nSpike Milligan at the Gate at the\nLatchmere, Battersea. Directed by John\nAntrobus.\nAlthough it sounds unlikely, this is a comedy\nabout the after-effects of a nuclear war on\nLondon. Nuclear war isn'ta subject one\nimmediately associates with humour but in this\ncase comedy serves only as a medium to\nconvey something of the consequences of a nuclear war. All the problems are covered:\nlack of medical care, no food, radiation\nsickness, poor communications, no shelter,\nmutations, psychological problems and so on.\nSounds hilarious doesn't it? Well it is funny.\nThis is Milligan style 'Daz-boxes worn round\nthe waist' lOOm ph zany comedy. Originally\nwritten in 1963 it has been resurrected and\nupdated by Antrobus. Whereas the original\nhad* a go at Harold Wilson, this version\nridicules Mrs Thatcher and the tories with\nmentions of the Falklands, Costa Mendez and\nthe Franks Report.\nAlthough the underlying subject matter is\nobviously serious the sheer chaos and absurd\ninconceivable results of nuclear war make the\nproduction amusing. The population is about\n900, no-one knows what has 'won', a char-lady\ncalled Mrs Scroake is Queen of England and\nso on. Mixed with this are knock-knock and\nother weak jokes that Tony Blackburn\nwouldn't use in his show.\nThe production was lively and went down\nwell with the audience (though one suspects\nthat many theatre-goers guffaw when i Wey think they are expected to, rather than when\nsomething genuinely amuses them).\nThe Gate Theatre is in The Latchmere pub\nin Battersea Park Road. It is a new theatre club\nwhich also features food and drinks in the\nrestaurant/cocktail bar which are designed to\ncompliment the plays. In this case a cocktail\ncalled Bikini Atholl was available.\nBedsitting Room 2 continues until Feb 19.\nNick Hill\nFELIX1 I February 4,19831 I Page7\n\n"
