A butterfly stomach, a dry mouth,\nsweaty palms, a thumping heart, a tense neck and a dull, pounding\nheadache; we all know how it feels.\nStress has become ac liche of the\neighties to the point where it has\nbeen accepted as normal. It is\n'trendy' to be busy, to be rushing\naround the place, to have 'no time\nto stop'. The medical dangers of\nstress have however, been\nconstantly buried in the subterfuge\nof action. A recent survey\ndiscovered that almost 80% of\npeople medically classified as being\nin a 'high stress risk group',\nbelieved that they were in no\nmedical danger as a result of the\nstress they were under. Medical\nhistory tells a different story.\nStress claims to be one of the\nbiggest Twentieth Century killers,\ndirectly linked to heart disease and\ncancer, responsible for 75% of all\nillness in Britain today. It costs about\n40 million working days each year,\nand accounts for 50% of deaths in men over 40 in Britain.\nA recent survey showed that\nuniversity students are under\ngreater stress than students in any\nother area of education. It also\ndiscovered that even greater levels\nof stress are encountered at\nuniversities falling into one of the\nfollowing categories.\ni) those situated in the centre of\nlarge cities.\nii) Those containing an uneven\nratio of males and females.\niii) Those situated in 'expensive\nliving cost' regions\niv) Those with high academic\nentrance requirements\nv) Those specialising in\nmedicine, veterinary medicine,\n' science or engineering.\nOn this basis, Imperial College\ncould be renamed 'Stress City.'\nStress-related disease is now so\nprevalent it is estimated to cost the\nmedical and social services an\naverage of \u00a355 million a year\u2014two\nor three per cent of the gross\nnational product.\nResearch into stress is going on all\nthe time, and it is now thought that\npeople can become hooked on the\nhormones they produce under\nstress. Permanently busy people can\nget high on their own 'nor-adrenaline', and so they become\nTHE TELL TALE SIGNS OF STRESS\n\u2022 Do you feel guilty when relaxing\u2014uneasy if not 'on the go'?\n\u2022 Do you lie awake worrying about tomorrow?\n\u2022 Are you tense...does you neck feel 'knotted up'?\n\u2022 Are you impatient or irritable\u2014do you interrupt when others\nare talking?\n\u2022 Do you feel that you have a lot on your mind \u2014have difficulty\nconcentrating?\n\u2022 Are you smoking or drinking more\u2014do you eat in a hurry?\n\u2022 Does life seem full of crises\u2014are you always having rows?\n\u2022 Do you find it difficult to make decisions?\n\u2022 Do you feel frustrated when people don't do what you want?\nIf you' ve said yes to any of these, read on... dependent on constant challenge,\nand non-stop deadlines is the only\nway to produce their best.\nPeople experience stress\ndifferently. Some thrive on what\nothers perceive to be negative\npressure; too little stimulus can also\nbe stressful.\nOur response to stress is part of\nthe dynamics of staying alive, the\nprimal instinct to survive. However,\ntoo much noise, too many people,\ncrowded cities, not enough air,\nexercise, peace or tr an quli ty, constant self-induced pressure over\nacademic work, and a consuming\ndesire to excel in examinations all\njangle the nerve endings, causing\nirritability, apathy, tension and,\neventually, illness.\nEating badly, drinking too much\nand particularly smoking can all\ncause strain. Mental stress is\ngenerated by aggression, impatience, anger, fear, anxiety, emotional\nconflict, inner turmoil, financial\ninsecurity, competitiveness and all\nthe major life events from childbirth\nthrough marriage to divorce and\nbereavement.\nChemical treatments such as\ntranquillisers are often more\nharmful than beneficial, and all-to-often become addictive. Last year\nfifteen million prescriptions were\nwritten for tranquillisers. It is\nestimated that there could be three\nmillion addicts in Britain.\nAlternative therapies and simple\nrelaxation exercises have provided\na far more effective re leif from the\nsymptoms in a number of cases.\nAromatherapy, the art of healing\nand relieving stress with the\nessen tia roils of plants is rapidly\nincreasing in popularity, and many\ndoctors recommend meditation and\nyoga for relaxation. A good way to\nhelp keep stress down is to\nremember to breath deeply from the\ndiaphragm and not the chest. This\ncontrols the blood pressure and\nreduces the tension in muscles.\nIt is important to cut down on\ndrinking and smoking. These may\nbe used to 'unwind', but the relief\nis only temporary, and the effect\nthey have numbs, rather than\nsolves, a problem. It is also obvious\nthat a large number of people at\nImperial have little or no beneficial\nexercise in their daily schedule. No miracles are required in this area.\nYou will survive if you are not in the\n1st XV in rugby. Gentle rhythmic\ncycling, jogging or swimming are\nideal ways of reducing the tension\ncaused by stress. They release pent-up energy and encourage deep,\nrefreshing sleep.\nBe aware of the damage stress can\ncause you. Review your lifestyle and\nunder. Take it easy, plan ahead so\nthat you can have 'evenings off occasionally, and don't ever believe\nthat getting tomorrow's problem\nsheet in is the most important thing\nin the world.\nMy aim is not to leave you with\na10% increase in stress levels,\nbecause you are so worried about\nthe dangers of stress! Reasonable\nlevels of stress are quite natural and\ninherently good. Stress is the body's ammunition in danger. It is a state\nof arousal when the body responds\nto unusual demands. The release of\nstress chemicals such as adrenaline,\nincreased blood pressure, heart rate,\noxygen intake and blood flow to the\nmuscles are all things that enable us\nto move fast and think clearly. But\nif the pressure is kept up for too\nlong, those responses become\nharmful, unhealthy and counterproductive.\nWorking on this feature made me\nmore and more aware of the risks\nevident at Imperial. Exams matter,\ndegrees matter, careers matter:\nHealth matters immeasurably more\nPage 10 FELIX January 27 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nDynamic\nDemocracy\nDear Bill, ' '.\nI have just attended the Student Loans meeting\nin the Great Hall and feel that some complaint\nmust be made about the disgraceful manner in\nwhich it was conducted.\nThe Chairman, Neil McClusky, who is neither\nthe U GM Chairman nor the Union Council\nChairman, was extremely biased in the comments\nthat he made both to the Rt Hon Peter Brooke\nand to the floor. Whether his views are pro- or\nanti-loans, the meeting should have been chaired\nin an impartial manner to give a fair chance to\nall points of view. The Chairman also called Peter\nBrooke, Mr Easterbrooke and Peter on several\noccasions, talked to Nigel Baker and rudely\ninterrupted with so-called points of information\nwhile Peter Brooke was in the middle of\nanswering questions.\nSurely it would not have been too much to\nexpect some courtesy to be shown to a guest by\ntwo official representatives of Imperial College,\nespecially when one was the President himself.\nNicky Fox, Physics 2.\nDog's Life\nDear Bill,\nI feel I must reply to the criticisms of my work\nin the article ' View from a Bridge'. The tone of\nthe article is such that it appears that I have done\nvery little work for the Union at all. I would like\nto point out that when last week's article was\npublished, I told Syd that I would expect to be\ns lagged off if there were things which people had\ncontinually pressed me on, but which I hadn't done. I would not accept criticisms where no one\nhad ever asked me why I hadn't done something.\nSyd is billed as 'diplomat extra ordinaire' but\nsurely it would have been diplomatic and more\nconstructive if he had discussed his criticisms\nwith all of us before rushing into print.\nI accept the criticism that I have done very little\nin the field of Academic Affairs, but I wonder if\nI could have done anything at all given my job\ndescription in August. Perhaps Mr HarbourBridge could explain why he initiated the changes\nin the sabbatical job descriptions without\nconsulting any of his Officers. For example, the\nDeputy President was made Chairman of the\nTransport Committee. This apparently innocuous\ntitle does not take into account the fact that vans\n.have to be serviced, insured, allocated to Clubs\nand Societies, bills paid, accounts balanced etc\u2014\nall of which takes a lot of time. The other\nsabbaticals will tell you that the system nearly\nbroke down during the summer. (It is rather\ndifficult to take a van for servicing when you have\ncontractors etc to deal with during a refurbishment of the premises.) This issue has\nbeen resolved now, but I should say that I see\nthe job that I'm doing now to be considerably\ndifferent to what Syd proposed last year. I regret\nto say this, but I have become more of an administrator rather than a representative.\nAlthough I tend to work most weekends, the\namount of administrative work that needs to be\ndone has crowded out most of the time that I would like to have devoted to Academic Affairs\nrepresentation, for example.\nI am sorry that Syd has Seen fit to ridicule me\nin front of the students, the Union Officers, and\nthe College personnel with Whom I have regular\ndealings. As well as this I am facing a revolt from\nthe Major Sub-committees (which control and\noversee the activities of the Union Clubs) over\nfundamental changes in the way that their\nfinances are dealt with. It brings into question\nwhether you can afford to have someone who\napparently has no credibility left, to have overall\nfinancial responsibility for an Union with a \u00a32\nmillion annual turnover and to make and implement important decisions on behalf of the\nstudents and negotiate with College on that basis.\nAs a result I have serious doubts as to whether\nI should continue as Deputy President when it\nseems that in doing so I will only cause more\nharm than good.\nI believe that I have worked hard for the\nstudents of College this year. I may not always\nhave done my best and admit that I have made\nmany mistakes in the course of my work. I would\nbe interested to hear what the IC U GM has to\nsay on this matter. If the students of this College\ndon't think that I'm doing my job properly, then\nthey will surely get rid of me.\nYours sincerely,\nCharles Brereton, ICU Deputy President.\nCounter-Waffle\nDear Bill,\nI did not intend to write in response to letters,\nbut considering the personal nature of Mr Greenwood's letter, I felt compelled to defend\nmy honour.\nI am writing in my own defence; it would be\nvery easy to get someone else to do it for me, but\nthis is a tactic used only by Union Officers who\nwish not to dirty their image. 'Ignore it, they'll\nforget it in two weeks; never write back', are very\nwise words from a very wise woman; the Union\nAdministrator. As a result of this advice we will\nnever hear Nigel Baker defend himself, it's too\nrisky.\nMr Greenwood has unfortunately got a number\nof matters wrong in his letter, it being rather long\nI shall not bore you with an expansion of my\nprevious article to correct these at the\nembarrassment of Mr Greenwood' s misunderstandings. It is, I feel, completely\nunderstandable that an enthusiastic, yet\ninexperienced, young Union activist will jump to\nthe wrong conclusions in his haste to make press.\nI only wish Chris had consulted me as to the\ncontent of his letter as well as Nigel, for I may\nhave managed to save him the embarrassment\nof being made a stool pigeon, something which\nwill not aid his campaign for Guilds Vice\nPresident at all. This is indeed sad as I believe\nthat Chris would do the job concerned well, and\nI am dismayed by his rash behaviour.\nWhat does help his cause is that he is, in fact,\nright that a Union Welfare Committee met last\nterm; I had not noticed its occur ance as the\nminutes were not distributed by the President at\nCouncil. Unfortunately I fear the meeting was\nm early used to rubber stamp the pre organised and hence predetermined ideas of the President.\nHe is also right that a Welfare Officer has been\nelected and I must apologise to that person for\nnot noticing his presence; it is presumably\nbecause the President had decided his job spent\nmuch of his budget before he was elected.\nMr Greenwood suggests my article was a matter of 'sour grapes'. This is not true; I have\nno political ambitions in this Union as, in fact,\nI cannot possibly take up a post next year. The\nseries of articles are intended to let me say what\nshould have been said many times, but which\nmost people are too scared to utter.\nI hope Chris will understand at the end of the\nseries that the articles had to start with the\nsabbaticals as they would have held no credibility\non other matters if I was not willing to criticise\nmy friends first. A cover up does no one any r good.\nChris asks what I did for Joe Student last year.\nWell I suggest he reads my seven page annual\nreport, especially the section on the \u00a33 million\nfrom Harlington that my research and negotiation\nhad all but secured for the Students' Union of\nthe future. Nigel Baker blew the whole deal\nwhilst breaking a Council ruling in the process.\nI would also like to announce my resignation\nfrom the post of Publications Board Chairman as\nI really cannot be bothered with pathetic people\nlike Nigel Whitfield any more. I am sure the\nCommittee will survive perfectly well without me\nas the Committee itself does very little anyhow.\nThe paper referred to in Nigel's letter in the last\nFELIX had been distributed in draft form at the\nPub Board meeting of December 5. It was\ndiscussed at the next meeting on January 9, which\nMr Whitfield did not attend, but sent a report\npointing out his abstention from all votes which\ndid not involve giving him more power. That\nmeeting, not I, agreed to the President's suggestion to redistribute the paper and ask for\nvery rapid comment. The paper did not suggest\nanything be done to IC Radio, only that someone\nbe appointed to look into a series of possibilities\nconcerning the whole of Pub Board. I therefore\nfind Nigel Whitfield's uninformed letter to FELIX\ninsulting, but wish him luck for the remainder\nof his degree and request he update the Pub\nBoard minute book with the last one and-a half\nyear's minutes as is his duty before the record\nof these meetings are lost forever.\nYours Sydney Harbour-Bridge,\nTolerance\nDear Bill,\nReading Mr Harbour-Bridge's article in the last\nissue, I suddenly became conscious of the fact\nthat Welfare money had been used in an irregular\nfashion by ICU to organise that ludicrous 'AIDS\nDay'!\nAnd what was there? Three homosexuals trying\nto persuade us of the justness of their views, a couple of other people, with enormous crosses\nhanging around their necks, d is tru but ing syringes 'for the safe use of drugs' (obviously had\nproblems with Bible comprehension) and a 'family planning' group: Totally irrelevant! A shame for Imperial College!\nI call all students who subscribe to my point\nof view to react;,some people have to be ousted\nfrom somewhere (remember last term's 'questionnaire' ?).\nEmmanuel Saridakis, Physics 1.\nPage 2 FELIX January 27 1989\n\n"

    "content": "News\nLoans demo faces\nset-back\nThe National Union of Students\nLondon branch ( NUS London) and\nthe University of London Union\nhave pulled out of the anti-loans\nmarch scheduled for 1 February.\nMembers of the Federal Campaigns\nCommittee (FCC) , a group set up\nby the UL U President's Council to\ndiscuss student loans have now\naccepted responsibility for the\ndemonstration.\nThe march was initially planned\nby NUS London for February 1st to\ncoincide with the last day for\nsubmission of comments on the\nGovernment White Paper on student loans. They withdrew\nbecause they believed that they did\nnot have the resources to organise\nthe march safely. The UL U Executive Committee had previously passed a policy to\nsupport the NUS and so also\ndecided to withdraw.\nLouise Van der Straeten, Vice\nPresident of UL U told FELIX that\nthe UL U Exec had no resources to\norganise the march itself and added\nthat several members of the Exec\nwould be unavailable on1 st February due to prior engagements.\nShe said that UL U would be writing\nto its constituent unions, stating its\nwithdrawal of all support for the\ndemonstration and said that they\nwould now concentrate their efforts\non the march organised by NUS National on February 25th. In a discussion on Monday evening described by the Chairman\nof the meeting as 'farcical', a motion\nwas passed to use the title UL UFC C on the publicity prepared for the\nmarch. Simon Aldiss, Co-President\nof the School of Oriental and African\nStudies (SOAS) proposed that the\nleaflets be headed with the words\n'London Students Against Loans' to\navoid use of the UL U name but\nseveral members felt that such\npublicity needed 'a commitment of\nactual organisations and representatives.' A subsequent vote\nresulted in an 18-14 majority in favour of the use of the name UL UFC C.UL U Acting-President, Nicola\nJones expressed her anger at the use\nof this name and stressed that 'the\nUL U Executive does not support the\nmarch and the FCC is not a recognised body of UL U.' She also\npointed out that the use of the title\nwas illegal and that UL U would\nconsider taking legal action against\nanyone involved in the production\nor distribution of publicity bearing\nit.\nThe FCC printed thirty thousand\nleaflets using the name UL UFC C and claiming support from the NUS Universities National Committee,\nbut following a meeting of the UL U exec on Tuesday when the Executive again rejected requests to\nsupport the march new leaflets\nheaded 'London Loans Campaign'\nhave been printed.\nKeith Budden, UL U International\nOfficer, whose name is on the public\norder bill for the march argued that\nit would continue without UL U and\nNUS support. He has negotiated a route with the police which will take\nthe march from Finsbury Circus to\nShoreditch Park and has insured\nhimself for up to \u00a33/4m. He insisted\nthat the Executive's support is\nneeded 'to provide money for\nleaflets, stewards' bibs, a lorry with\naPA and a number of other items.'\nHe added that the use of the name\nUL UFC C would give 'c redi oil it y' to\nthe march.\nMr Al diss and Jim Coyle, President of Goldsmiths College\nStudent Union have since added\ntheir names to the public order bill\nfor the march and, along with the\npresidents of the Institute of\nEducation and City University and\nthe co-presidents of Queen Mary\nCollege and SO AS, have set up an\norganising committee for the march.\nA meeting of 20 stewards was\nheld last night after further\ncommunication with the police. The\norganisers intend to ' vet' the\nstewards and will be providing\nthem with bibs and providing the\npolice with photocopies of their\nunion cards. They hope that 'up to\n80 stewards' will be available to\noversee the demonstration.\nImperial College Union held an\nemergency executive meeting on Wednesday morning at which it was\nnoted that the original decision to\nsupport the demonstration was\nmade at the last UG Mon the\nunderstanding that the NUS was\nthe organising body. The Executive\nreleased a statement withdrawing\nits support for the march on the\nbasis that such action would 'place\nthe members of IC Union in physical\ndanger.' The decision overturns a motion passed at the last U GM on\na technicality. The proposer of the\nmotion, Julian Moore, now intends\nto support the Executive in their\ndecision.\nAUT\nUpdate\nIC Union is to investigate the legal\nposition of students and their\nUniversities where degrees are\naffected by the AUT' s examination\nboycott after a mandate at Monday's Council meeting.\nUnion President, Nigel Baker is to\nvisit a barrister today in order to find\nout whether there is any legally\nbinding requirement for Universities\nto provide final examinations. If\nthere is a legal case for students to\ntake up, Mr Baker hopes its use will\nput pressure on Universities to\nsupport the AUT' s claim for a wage\nincrease for 1988/89. He added that\nhe thought there may be other legal\ngrounds for a court case apart from\na breach of contract, saying 'We are\nlooking at all sides of it.'\nExecutive\nAnnouncement\n\u2022 ICU has a policy that it should\nsupport the demonstration on February 1.\n\u2022This support was given on the\nunderstanding that the NUS had\ncalled a national demonstration on\nFebruary 1.\n\u2022 ICU Exec has met and, in agreement with the proposer of the\nmotion, has decided that IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION WILL NOT BE\nSUPPORTING THE DEMONSTRATION ON FEBRUARY1. The reasons for this are:\n\u2022 The NUS has withdrawn the\nmarch.\n\u2022 UL U feel that they do not have the\nresources to organise the march\nproperly and so are not.\n\u2022 Political activists, ie members of\nSocialist Workers Students Society\nand Militant, are now organising the\nmarch.\n\u2022The stewards are likely to be\nmembers of SWSS.\n\u2022 SWSS are campaigning for an illegal march to the DES on that day.\n\u2022 The Exec feel that the march is\nlikely to degenerate into a riot.\n\u2022The Exec feel that if ICU support\nthe march we will be placing the\nmembers of this Union in physical\ndanger since we cannot guarantee\ntheir safety.\n\u2022 I hope you understand the\nreasons for this decision.\nNigel D Baker,\nOn behalf of ICU Executive.\nComic\nRelief!\nEx Union President, Sydney Harbour-Bridge (name changed in\naid of Comic Relief) has resigned\nfrom his post as Publications Board\nChairman. The move is reported to\nbe a result of pressure from IC Radio\nStation Manager, Nigel Whitfield.\nAt Monday's Council meeting Mr Harbour-Bridge told members\npresent that he felt there were more\nproductive things he could do with\nhis time. Mr Harbour-Bridge is\ncurrently standing for the post of\nUnion House Committee Chairman.\nRed faces\nThere were red faces all round this\nweek when a Dalek smashed its\nway into the FELIX Office and exterminated the small ads. Gorgeous pouting Steve Meyfroidt,\n20, said, 'It was like a bolt from the\nblue'.

    "content": "Opinion\nICU - the Fourth Reich?\nBy now the details of the decisions taken at ICU council and the details\nof the motion to be taken to next weeks U GM will have been reported\nby FELIX and ICU will have a clear choice on whether to abolish UG Ms as the supreme body of the union. The purpose of this article is not to\ncriticise any of the union officers for their views, which I believe to be\nsincerely held. It is to initiate a more detailed debate on the issues raised\nby the proposal and to think through some of the consequences for the\nunion and for FELIX. I do not believe that such a debate has occurred,\ncertainly not at the recent council meeting. This article is intentionally\nbrief and so not exhaustive. It is also provocative, but so is the proposal\nto be put to the U GM. more polarised, and often less\nrepresentative groups eg Major Sub\nCommittees (MSC's). In effect this\npower would place more stresses on\nCouncil as a decision making body\nincreasing its factionalism. Indeed,\nit is questionable whether Council\nat the moment conducts itself\neffectively in terms of debate and\ndiscussion.\nThere are other ways in which the\nproposed change in the balance of\npower could affect Council. For\ninstance it would be much easier for\na sabbatical to revoke their election\nmanifesto confident in the\nknowledge that 20 to 30 votes at\nCouncil would see him, or her,\nthrough the year.\nIn the same way major policy\ndecisions could be taken by groups\nof individuals elected by, though\nnot representative of, the student\nbody. Thus there would be the\ndistinct danger that the views of the\nUnion as would be expressed by the\nCouncil would significantly diverge\nfrom the views of students. The\nmajor difference from the current\nsituation is that this could arise\nconsciously by Council members\ntaking a 'more balanced view'rather\nthan passive apathy at UG Ms. Lastly a parallel proposal has been\nmade at Council for more authority\nto be delegated to its sub-committees. This delegation could\nbe justified by managerial\narguments. However, despite\nappearances, in a student union the\nmanagement arguments must be\nsubjugated to those of democracy\nand accountability. If this is not\nchallenged a system is legitimised\nwhere key decisions are taken by an\noligarchy of no more than 8 or 9\npeople. I understand that Mrs Thatcher uses the same system\nherself.\nFELIX\nThe problem\nPerhaps the clearest aspect of the\nmatter. It is to integrate Saint Mary's Hospital Medical School Students\nUnion ( SM HMS SU) into ICU as a Constituent College Union with full\nparticipation in the re cost it u ted union of ICU, within the constraints\nof a split site. This is a dilemma\nfacing a number of colleges\nthroughout London and no doubt\nthe executive would have analysed\ntheir solutions.\nThe working party solution\nThe proposal to radically change\nthe status of UG Ms is an extreme\nproposal which I would now like to\ndiscuss at some length.\nIs it Democratic?\nThis is, of course, not the question\nwhich is central but will no doubt\nbe raised by many students. The\nanswer is that the Union would still\nbe run along broadly democratic\nlines with mass elections, with an\nAGM where reports can be\npresented and Emergency General\nMeetings (EGMs) that can be called\nby students. However, it is better to\nquestion whether this framework,\nwould strengthen the Union in terms of increased participation in\nits affairs and its campaigns by\nstudents. I think not.\nICU Council\nThe incorporation of medical\nschool student union reps on Council will not change it\nappreciably. Their numbers will be\ntoo small to significantly influence\nCouncil other than as a pressure\ngroup. The same problems that exist\nwith the representative role of\nUG Ms would exist in microcosm on\nCouncil. The real changes would be\ndue to the concentration of\nsovereign power in the hands of a small core of individuals who will be\nfree of any wider accountability to\nthe student body. Their\naccountability would be to smaller,\nIt is quite clear that the abolition\nof UG Ms would leave FELIX as the\nonly medium for direct\ncommunication between ICU and its\nsabbaticals. This undoubtedly would make FELIX much more\npowerful within the Union. That the\nExec realise this is clear from their\nrather heavy handed attempt to\nexert authority over the Editor and\nthe editorial authority of FELIX. In\na very specific way the exec will\nbegin to define themselves acting as\nif they are accountable to FELIX. It\nis through FELIX that they will have\nto persuade, convince, justify and\ncampaign.\nThis raises the serious question of\neditorial freedom that I am sure Bill\nGoodwin can discuss elsewhere. I would only offer the view that the\npower of FELIX will undoubtedly\nplace it in a very good postion to\nconstruct alliances of its own and to\nplay the system whether as 'king-maker' for future sabbatical\ncandidates or as a voice of a certain\nsection of the Union. This will\ncrystal is e the central problem and\nthe greatest argument against\nincreasing de facto the power of\nFELIX. This is again accountability.\nAn editor with any degree of\neditorial freedom would only be\nnominally accountable to Council.\nCouncil would, therefore, become\ndependent on the whim of such an\neditor acting alone (rather like Lee\nHarvey Oswald). Should Council\nfind this intolerable and totally\nconstrain the editor FELIX would\nbecome the docile organ of the\nUnion rather like Pravda. And the\nUnion would have sacrificed both\nFELIX and its U GM on the basis of\nshort term goals.\nParticipation\nThe power of an open meeting to\ninvolve ordinary members in important affairs of the Union is\nundeniable. Certainly a general\napathy - perhaps complacency -amongst students exists yet ther\nhave been many occasions\nthroughout the last ten years when\n600 people packed the Great Hall\nans played an important role in Union policy. Eliminate the U GM and such popular involvement in student politics will be severely\ndiminished. It is interesting to see\nthat no national trade union has\nabandoned the public meeting as an\neffective mechanism for the\nparticipation of members in party\naffairs. They recognise that the only\nreal power they have is through a mass action. How sure would\na future president be of being able to\ninvolve students in mass action? Fragmentation of the Union I have discussed a situation where\na remote council and executive lose\ncontact with the views of the\nstudent body. I suspect that if this\noccurs then eventually those bodies\nthat offer participation will attract\nthe enthusiasm and loyalty of\nstudents, in particular the CC Us and\nto a lesser extent the MSC s. This\nwould inevitably lead to a less\ncorporate approach to decision\nmaking with ICU's role diminishing\nin proportion to its loss of popular\nsupport. The Exec will have to\nreconcile many more vocal and mandated council members less\nprepared to compromise. A new\ntribalism would emerge.\nThe election and dismissal of\nsabbaticals\nI am old enough to know former\npresidents of the ICU who were\nelected by and from Council and\nwere dismiss able by Council. The\ninevitable consequence of making\nCouncil supreme is that any sabbatical who is gets a vote of no\nconfidence at a meeting would\nprobably be unable to continue in\noffice. I also suspect that a proposal\nwould eventually emerge to return\nto the election of the sabbaticals by\nCouncil acting as an electoral\ncollege. You may think this last\npoint a flight of fantasy yet it is not\nso distant from the leap to create a sovereign Council.\nThe solution\nI cannot do other than stimulate\na debate from which I hope amore\ninspired vision emerges. I do not\naccept that there is no federal\nsolution which preserves and enhances both the new C CU and\nthe reconstituted IC/S M HMS SU. Having decided that the baby and\nthe bath water should be separated\nthe drowning of the baby is not an\nacceptable alternative.\nStephen Goulder\nICU President 198283\nRCSA Rep to Council\nJanuary 27 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

Subsequent jumps\nare \u00a312, approximately \u00a34 of which\nwill be refunded by us on production of are cie pt.

This will\nthen be completed on the Saturday\nat Headcorn Parachute Club (near\nAshford) and, weather permitting,\nyou will also do your first parachute\njump.\nIf after reading the above you are\nstill interested come along to our\nweekly Monday meetings at\n12.30pm in the Union Dining Hall\n(first floor of the Union Building).\nYou will be required to pay a \u00a320\ndeposit to secure your place on the\ncourse and \u00a34 Club membership.\nIf you are still unsure please feel\nfree to come to the meetings and\nhave a chat with one of the\nCommittee.\nI.C.C.A. G. ICCA G \u2014 Is there life after College?\nWhilst at College it is all too easy to\nbelieve that these Ivory Towers are\nall that matters for the next three or\nfour years and in so doing ignore\nthe existence of a far larger\ncommunity which is all around us\nand has had to tolerate the presence\nof five thousand or more Imperial\nstudents every year.\nICCA G is part of a national\nnetwork of College Community\nAction Groups. The words Community Action do not mean\nthat we are all out to change the\nworld but it does mean that we are\na part of a group of over 15,000\nstudents who are involved in the\ncommunity in which we live and\nstudy through many different kinds\nof voluntary work.\nWe now have a new constitution\nwhich should make it easier for us\nto publicise and organise links with\nthe local community. But whilst we\ncan put as many posters and write\nas many articles as we like about\nvoluntary work. such as the\nPlaygroup which we are involved\nwith, the Soup Run and other\nactivities, it is all wasted unless\npeople are prepared to look outside\nCollege and see what else is going\non.\nThere will be a meeting next\nMonday (23rd) at 12.45pm in the\nICCAG/Rag Office which is on the\ntop floor of the Union Building. So\nif you are interested then come\nalong or if you can't make it then get\nin touch with us through the Soup\nRun or the ICCA G pigeonhole in the Union Office.\nWELLSOC\nIllegible\nWellsoc have done negotiation with\nthe managers of Skirmish to offer\nhis game again at 75% discount (ie\n\u00a35). most of this is illegible\u2014TS.\nSNOOKER\nThe Snooker Club is proud to\npresent the 1989 doubles\ncompetition.

Imperial\nCollege Conservative Society is still\nvery active and has five speaker\nmeetings scheduled for the rest of\nthis term. Notably we have Douglas\nHurd, the Home Secretary, visiting\non February 7. The Society supports\nthe Government's plans for student\nloans and we believe the majority of\nIC students couldn't really care less.\nWe should not think that the current\nleft ish rabble is representative of\nmore than a handful of hacks.\nOur contribution to the argument\nwill be a speaker meeting on \u2022February 14 by Angela Rumbold,\nMinister of State for Education and\nKen Baker's deputy. Ms Rumbold\nwill put the Government's case on\nloans and we hope many people will\ncome and listen to the expert.\nFOOTBALL SKI RACING\nWham!\nRoyal Free\u20141\nIC II\u20142\nIC's successful season continued\nwith another fine win against RF H on a very heavy pitch. Unable to\nplay their normal fast flowing\nfootball, IC worked hard to secure\ntwo points in their title challenge. It\ncould have been a different story\nhad RF H scored a one on one after\nten minutes, but a brave save from\nWebster Nonde kept IC on course.\nIt wasn't long before the dead lock\nwas broken when Guy Phiri beat\ntwo defenders and squared the ball\nfor Adam Thomas to pass the ball\nto the net, just like Jimmy Greaves\nshowed him in the week. A good\nfirst half performance was consolidated when Mickey Plummer dribbled through most of\nthe RF H team before firing home for\ntwenty yards. Mickey and Ed Coates then both hit the bar and the\nkeeper made good saves from Guy Phiri and Russ Dark as IC piled on\nthe pressure. But close to the end,\na mix up in IC's defence allowed\nRF H to get a cons il ation goal, and\nan equalise r may have ensued but\nfor resolute defending from Captain\nJezz Holland and Ivan Parkin.\nIC (l st s)l Goldsmiths\u20140\nA mere 2,500, IC's lowest home gate\nof the season, turned out on this\ndismal Saturday afternoon to see the\n'Blues' register another crucial\nchampionship victory against\ndefending champions, Goldsmith's Collge.\nThe muddy conditions made IC's normally fluent passing game\nsomewhat difficult to play but it was\na typical piece of one-touch football\nthat brought the winner midway\nthrough the first half. A series of\ndelightful passes released Pip Peel\non the left and his pin-point cross\nwas beautifully chested down by\nPaul Olden who calmly slipped past\na defender before jabbing him his\nsecond goal in successive games.\nThe rest of the game was a tale of\ncrunching tackles and IC attacks\nfrustrated more by the elements\nthan by good defending. Goldsmiths came back into the\nmatch as IC legs began to tire in the\nlast fifteen minutes but Messrs\nEwart, Hattersley, Fisher, and Burton showed why IC have the\nbest defensive record in the league,\nkeeping them comfortably at bay;\nindeed Paul Olden nearly added a second a second late on when he\npowered a head just wide.\nIC now lead the Premier Division\nby three points left to play.\nLast Sunday night the Superbowl\nwas not the only major sporting\nevent occurring. Three teams from\nIC Ski Club were battling it out in freezing conditions at Brentwood\ndry slope in the third race of the\nseason. The biggest problem of the\nevening turned out to be the ski\nbindings which were set at a ridiculously low setting, so skis\ntended to come off spontaneously,\nresulting in a lot of falls. Despite\nthis, the 1st team survived the first\nround unbeaten, and the 2nd and\n3rd teams lost only one race each,\ndue to the dubious placings system\nused by the organisers, the 2nd and\n3rd teams could not subsequently\ncome higher than 7th, so they did\nvery well to come 7th and 8th respectively after a thrilling race\nbetween themselves. Anna performed some more ballet in the\nsecond round, injuring herself in the\nprocess, and forcing a re-run of the\nentire round. In the rerun everybody got it right, qualifying us\nfor the final against RH BN C1st, which we won by 2 gates.\nThanks to Anna, Emma, Derek,\nClive, Chris, Patrick, Stefan, Guy, Paul, Danny, Jack, the two others\nwhose names I 've forgotten, and especially 'the fan club'.\nNext race on Saturday Feb 25 at\nHemel Hempstead (sign up on 23rd please).\nHOCKEY\nIC 3rds \u20146\nMeadhurst (BP)\u20140\nAfter a defeat on Wednesday the\n3rd again produced a very fine all\nround performance for a resounding\nvictory on a very wet pitch due to\nsome far from fine weather.\nA quiet day in goal for Andy still\nsaw him give the opposition there\nbest chance to score when he gave\naway a penalty flick, but he\nredeemed himself producing a good\nsave. Gary (a renegade from some\ntotally un credit worthy team)\nplaying in his first game after injury\nhad an important role at centre-half\nsetting up lots of play for the\nforwards.\nSeveral good crosses supplied by\nVijay enabled Kaleem to add two\nmore to his tally for the year, and\ndespite his inability to convert short\ncorners, Steven managed to score\nanother hat trick. The game didn't go all IC's way with the home side\nquick on the break and despite stout\ndefence, especially from Eric, they\nwere unlucky not to score, with a saved penalty and a disallowed\nshort corner. Somewhere amongst\nall this Kevin brought the total to six\nwith a 'delicate' 'placed' shot.\nJanuary 27 1989 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Someone to\nLove\nICA, from Jan 20\n'This is a movie isn't it?' asks Orson\nWelles, approaching the end of\nSomeone to Love.\nHenry Jaglom's( writer, director,\nmain actor) previous film Always\ntold the story of his own divorce,\nand starred himself and his ex-wife,\nshot in the home they lived in before\nseparating. Small wonder, then,\nthat this new product seems barely\nshifted from reality, an unusual\nhybrid of cinema and documentary,\nwith a touch of home movie style\neven (barring the competent camera\nwork and superb editing, the latter\nJaglom's forte).\nJaglom plays film director Danny,\npuzzled by the fact that none of his\nfriends seem to be in permanent\nrelationships. Plus his girlfriend\nwon't let him sleep overnight in her\nbed, her own space. Danny's sensible, property a qui ring elder\nbrother, Michael, has acquired a lovely old theatre in Santa Monica,\nand sold it, shortly to be turned into\na shopping centre. Naturally,\nDanny invites all his 'lonely heart'\nfriends to the theatre on Valentine's Day, pulls along a camera crew, and\nfilms, rapping out ' Why are you\nalone?' to all and sundry.\nThe film is shot through with\nemotive, ironic and often funny\nobservations by a splendid range of\ncharacters, all believable as\nindividuals, and nicely rounded off\nby the slightly cynical Michael, a bit\nsuspicious of ' all these actors,\nartists...that kind of thing.' As the\nparty progresses everyone eats,\ndrinks, talks, and has their say into\na camera.\nThis part of the film has been\nlovingly crafted to blend formal with\ncasual proto graph y, cutting off\ncamera exchanges (private scenes\nover lunch, and in the ladies room)\nwith Danny' s free-for-all talk\nexchange in the main theatre hall.\nEven a reluctant cameraman is\npulled to face the camera to consider\nhis partner-less state.\nPresiding over, or rather behind\nevents is Orson Welles. In this, his\nlast screen performance, Welles is\nlifted almost entirely out of context\nand given an un moving, magisterial\nposition seated in the back row of\nthe theatre. 'I'm speaking from the\ncheap seats, not Mount Sinai' he\nbarks, necessarily reminding on and\noff screen mentor Jaglom not to take\nhis word as law. Welles is\ncommentator, the supreme\nr1ti lf The Long Dark TeaTime of the Soul Douglas Adams\nMany moons ago the British radio\ncomedy scene was shattered by a revolutionary new series. Where The\nHitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy broke\nnew ground was in its humour as\nmuch as anywhere. It had some.\nAfter bleeding the characters,\nplots and universe in general dry,\nwith three good books and a lousy\none, Douglas Adams has begun a new collection. It seems that he\nwants to be remembered as 'that\nman' who wrote some funny stuff\nonce for the wireless by not writing\nanything else amusing.\nIt is almost impossible to describe\nthis latest book without reference to\nits predecessor Dirk Gentry's Holistic\nDetective Agency which sat in the\nbest-seller lists for the whole of last\nyear. Why either one could be a observer, throwing out the funniest,\nand most profound lines in the film\nconcerning the feminist revolution,\npopulation explosion, decline of the\ncommunist state of the movie and\nmore. This, apart from the ideas and\nhumour, is a priv el edged glimpse\ninto the 15-year friendship between\nJaglom and Welles: Welles giving\nJaglom insight, and relishing the\nsuccess, beyond the author's reputation, I cannot fathom.\nGently is a sleuth with some\ninterest in Physics, and attempts to\nprove the fundamental interconnected ness of all things. This he\nquite resoundingly fails to achieve.\nFurthermore he has become the\nmain character of the second tale,\nrevealing just how incompletely he\napproaches everything, but more\nimportantly losing all the mystery\nwhich kept me reading the first\nbook when the story escaped me.\nWhile the plot is just about\ndecipherable this time, the\ndescriptive passages and observational style maintain Adams'\nunique manner, and the book is\nlargely unoffensive, it is not funny\nor compelling or even thick and\nchunky and nice to hold. I only read\nit to the end to find out just what\nthe eagle and Coca-Cola vending\nmachine had to do with everything.\nThe answer to that can be found on\npage 242.\nThose of you about to buy it\nbecause you didn't get it for\nChristmas\u2014don't bother.\nAndrew Clarke.\nrepartee involved. The film ends\nwith Welles shouting 'cut!' as\nDanny's movie has run its course,\nand a marvellous image of a deep\nrumble-bellied laugh, with a glint in\nthe eye that will refuse to die.\n' My God, you are looking for\nemotional truth' exclaims Yelena\u2014\nwhether Jaglom finds any is\ndebatable; what has been\nReviews\nImpressionists\nUnder the umbrella of\nImpressionism in the 1870s and '80s, it would be hard to find two more\ndisparate talents than those of\nClaude Monet and Pual Gauguin.\nMonet, the master, whose 'Impression: Sunrise' gave the\nmovement its name, enjoyed critical\nand financial recognition for his\nartistic strength and originality. His\nwork is a celebration of light, never\ntwice interpreting the subtle\ninterplay of light and shadow in quite the same way. By applying\nsmall, separate daubs of colour,\neach object in his work 'loses its\nlocal identity' and vibrates to give\nan impression of the whole.\nIn total contrast, both in art and\noutlook was Paul Gauguin. The\nman whose rebellious attempts at\nemancipation from European discipline ended in abject poverty in\nthe South Seas, broke from the\nImpressionist style at the early\nstage. At variance with Impressionist practice, he used strong, flat\ncolour with forms often rimmed\nwith contour lines. Simplifying his\npalette, he adopted a vivid reinterpretation of colour rather than\na naturalist reproduction. \"That\nshadow is rather blue, so paint it\nwith pure ultramarine. Those leaves\nare red? Put on pure vermillion.'\nThese two hard-backed volumes\nfrom part of \"The Impressionists'\nseries, published by Cassell. They\nare exquisitely produced to a glossy\n96-page formula, perfect for the\nesoteric coffee table, and have the\nvirtue of being reasonably priced.\nBoth texts are very interesting,\nconsidering his rebellious attitudes,\nescapist travels, and attempted\nmurder with a cut-throat razor by\nVan Gogh, however un salaciously described. These are beautiful\nbooks, of the sort that it is very\npleasant to leaf through in bookshops, and think of an excuse\nto yourself for buying.\nAlan Young.\naccomplished is an entertaining\nchronicle, documenting an entire\ngeneration. Gleeful comedy, delicate character is ation, the'mighty\nWelles and skillful editing all combine to make Someone to Love an\ninteresting film, and as funny a documentary as you're likely to\nfind.\nSusan Appleby.\nJanuary 27 1989 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "Travel\n^INDEPENDENT\nELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER T RAV Off the beaten track - Brunei\nThe oil and gas rich State of Brunei\nDarrussalam, on the northern coast\nof the island of Borneo, is one of the\nsmallest and wealthiest nations in\nthe world. With an area of 5,765\nsquare kilometres and a population\nof 220,000, Brunei has a per capita\nincome of about US$17,000 per year,\ngiving its people one of the highest\nstandards of living in Asia.\nThe country is a monarchy, ruled\nby His Majesty Sir Hassanal\nBolkiah. Brunei was a British\nprotectorate until January 1 1984\nwhen it became independent. The\ncapital is Bandan Seri Begawan.\nThe country has not developed\nquite as fully as a tourist spot,\nthough the potential is there. This\ncountry would be for those who are\ntired of going to the common places.\nIt will be a change albeit an expensive one.\nThe climate is equatorial with high\ntemperature, humidity and rainfall.\nTemperatures average 28 \u00b0C and\nthere is little variation. So take with\nyou t shirts, short sleeve shirts and\nshorts. It tends to get very hot\nespecially under the sun.\nThe first thing you notice about\nBrunei, as your plane prepares to\nland, is the greenery. Green trees,\ngrass and bushes everywhere\nIt seems they have built a city in\nthe middle of the jungle.\nThe capital itself is small, probably\nthe size of Kensington. Everyone\nknows everyone there. Thanks to\noil, however, the cars you will find\non the roads will be of the latest\nmodel. Almost everything is\nimported, as it is cheaper to do so.\nThat includes even the vegetables.\nThe most famous landmark of\nBrunei is the Sultan Oman Ali Saifuddin Mosque, in the capital,\nnamed after the present ruler's father. It's simply majestic. You just\nhave to stand back and look. It is an\nedifice of classical Islamic\narchitecture. Its distinct feature is\nthe gold-plated dome which rises to\na height of 52 metres. Be careful that\nyou are properly dressed and leave\nyour shoes/sandals outside when\nyou go in. Part of the capital stands on water.\nIt is a grouping of small villages on\nBrunei River called Kampu.ig Ayer\n(or water village). In fact it was the\noriginal capital and synonymous\nwith Brunei itself. The Italian\ntraveller, Antonia Pigaletta, who\ntravelled with Magellan and arrived\nin 1521, described it as a city of\n25,000 families.\nThe town is basically an extensive\ncollection of houses on stilts. These\nhouses have all the luxuries\nnormally associated with modern\nliving, including schools, clinics,\npost offices, electricity and water\nsupplies. Take a tour of this village\nby one of the numerous water taxis\navailable. It's a bit of a wonder that\nthey don't get tired of living there,\nsurely if you don't look where you\nare going, you end up with wet\nclothes.\nThe Nurul Iman Palace is the\nofficial residence of His Majesty, the\nSultan. You should be contented\nwith just a look from outside as it\nis not open to the public. However,\nif your visit coincides with the Hari\nRaya Festival (at the end of the\nfasting month of Ramadan) the\npalace is open and the public is\ninvited to visit the Royal Family and\nlook around the palace. This is\nusually some time in April or May. The other places to visit are the\nBrunei Museum and the Arts and\nHandicrafts Centre. The museum\nhas a large collection of exhibits of\nthe cultural heritage of the country.\nThe Arts and Handicrafts Centre\noffers silverware, bronze ware and\nbrass ware which are crafted\naccording to the Malay Cultural\nHeritage. One thing to see, is how\nthe Kris is made. Kris is the Malay'sI ancient weapon. It has a razor sharp\nblade which is usually wavy. It was\nused by the royalty and commoners\nin the old days.\nSeria is the most vital town after\nthe capital and has been the seat of\nBrunei's petroleum industry since\ni oil was first struck there in 1929. Just\noutside this oil town is Lumut\nwhere the world's largest Liquefied\nNatural Gas plant operates.\nThe cheapest places to stay in Brunei are prop ably the Brunei\nHotel and Capitol Hostel. The rates\nare still pretty high. Phone them\nfrom the airport.\nTransport is the most frustrating\naspect here. Public transport is\nvirtually non-existent except for the\nvery expensive taxis. Everyone here\nseems to have one or two cars.\nLuckily the capital is small enough\nthat you can visit all the places on\nfoot. Though as I said, it can get\nbloody hot walking around.\nThere are coaches to other towns\nrunning from the bus station in the\ncity centre.\nThere are no direct flights to\nBandan Seri Begawan from London.\nYou will have to go to Singapore\nand take a connecting flight. The\nfare from Singapore to Brunei is\nabout the same as from London to\nSingapore, there is a wide variety\nfrom Aeroflot (very cheap but via\nMoscow, a painfully long flight) to\nthe direct flight by Singapore\nAirlines. For British citizens, visas\nare not required for visits up to\nthirty days.\nNote: Brunei is an Islamic\ncountry. So please dress modestly.\nKissing and holding hands in public\nis frowned upon.\nWaseem A Siddiqi,\nElec Eng 3. ,\nPage 6 FELIX January 27 1989\n\n"

    "content": "City & Guilds blood donations\nOn Tuesday January 31, the South\nLondon branch of the National\nBlood Transfusion Service will be\nholding a day-long session in Southside Gym. Their target is 160\ndonations during the day, and a list\nfor volunteers is posted in the City\n& Guilds Union Office.\nEvery donation has to be\nthoroughly tested before it can be\nstored ready for use in an emergency or an operation\u2014blood\nwhich has successfully been tested\nhas a shelf life of 35 days maximum.\nSome tests can be performed at the\ndonation site itself; the rest must be\ncarried out in a laboratory, no more\nthan three hours after donation.\nTesting starts with taking two\nsamples from the donation\u2014all\nthree lots of blood are immediately\nlabelled to allow identification. One\nsample is used for grouping; the\nother is allowed to clot, forming a serum which is used for testing for\ndiseases which may be transmitted\nby transfusion. The labelling used\nemploys a bar code, allowing any\ndonation in the UK to be traced back\nto its origins.\nThe grouping test identifies the\ntwo main blood group systems\u2014\nABO and Rhesus (Rh). The ABO system falls into four main groups\u2014O, A,B and AB, the Rh system divides into Rh positive and\nRh negative. Thus eight categories\nof blood type are formed, aside from\nother, more complicated, systems.\nMost people will remember blood\ngrouping from ' O' Level Biology.\nAll these tests can now be\nperformed automatically, with chemical changes being assessed by\nphotoelectric cells and results\ncompiled by computer. Donor\nrecords are also stored on computer,\nthe two systems being linked.\nDisease testing on the clotted\nsample checks in particular for\nsyphillis, hepatitis B and HIV. All such tests are performed separately,\nto allow use of the most sensitive,\nrapid and economic method for\neach. Syphillis is not as serious a problem as it used to be, but still\nexists in the general public\u2014each\ntest costs about five pence. Hepatitis\nis a more serious problem, as the\nvirus lives in the plasma, which is\npooled from many samples for\nplasma products. Thus thousands of\npeople could be infected with\nhepatitis from a single donation.\nSeveral methods of screening exist\nfor hepatitis, all involving detection\nof the virus in the blood. The cost\nof the cheapest test is about twelve\npence per sample.\nThe most recent screen to be\nintroduced is one for HIV, which\nlooks for the HIV antibody. This is\none of the more expensive tests\ncarried out, at forty-five pence per\nsample.\nMany more tests are carried out,\nmost for tropical diseases which are\nrare in the UK\u2014this is why people\nwho have recently been to certain\ncountries are asked not to donate\n(they may have returned with more\nthan just a tan!).\nAll blood that is collected in the\nUK is collected by the BTS, part of\nthe NHS\u2014there is as yet no private\nservice. There are no financial\nrewards for giving blood, just a satisfaction at having potentially\nsaved someone's life. Besides, it's a good excuse to lie down for half\nan hour and grab a cup of tea during\nthe day.\nCouncil\nSketch\nAnd it all began so quietly.\nMonday's Council sort of drifted\ntogether with a resigned air. There\nwas little on the agenda that even\nsparked a little enthusiasm from the\nattendees. A little debate on sub wardens was referred back to\nHousing Committee because Council\nwas too bored to discuss it. A few\nradicals felt the need to take legal\naction against the AUT over their\nboycott of exams, but nobody's heart was in it.\nBut slowly the tension began to\nbuild up. Even more unlikely,\npeople began to wake up. The\nattacks on democracy were\nbeginning. Neil M cCl us key proposed a motion, which at first\nreading, looked so uninteresting\nthat it could have passed as any\nother Council paper. But Cosmic\ntried to amend it! It must be worth\nlooking at. The motion made it no\nlonger compulsory for subcommittees to present their minutes\nto Council, merely to report to it.\nLess things for Council members to\nread, must be a good idea. With as uprising ly short debate, the motion\nwas passed, meaning that the exec\n(amongst others^ no longer have to\ntell anyone exactly what they are\ndoing. Then all hell broke loose.\nThe SM HMS U/ ICU working party\nhad found a problem over UG Ms after the proposed merger of the\nUnions next year. It seemed unfair\nthat ICU( with the majority of\nstudents) should hold the majority\nof UG Ms where Marys' opinions\nwere likely to be swamped. It seems\nreasonable, except that the solution\nis, obviously, to abolish UG Ms and\nmake Council the supreme body.\nMuch of Council loved this; some\nof Council thought it the most\nout r ago us thing they had ever\nheard, and so the fun began. Syd\nHarbour Bridge proposed amendment after amendment before anyone had had a chance to\ncomment on the original. In one of\nthe most sophisticated bit of\nfilibustering (delaying tactics) ever\nseen, he pretended to support the\nmotion whilst delaying it for over an\nhour. In attempting to mandate the\nFELIX Editor to print reports he\nbrought back the oldest Council\nche s nut of them all and forced the\ndebate several miles off the point\nbefore the poor chairman had a chance to take control. (Now repeat\nafter me, children, You can't tell the\nFELIX Editor what to put in FELIX)\nAfter half of Syd' s garbled,\nmisunderstood and mostly unheard\namendments were passed and the\nother half consigned to oblivion, he\nwithdrew the whole lot, triumphantly having moved the\nmeeting an hour closer to the\nlooming guillotine. Steph Snell then\npicked up the whole of Syd's discarded amendments and got\nthem reinstated, wasting another\nhalf an hour.\nBy now both sides were in full\nswing with hastily imagined amendments being created around\nthe table, pitched in to be taken up by a voter, and then battered down\nwith points of information, procedural motions, and good old\nfashioned ranting. Dave Clements\nwas in fine form, turning pinker and\npinker whilst defending good old\nhome-spun democracy with all his\nmany years of experience. At one\npoint a point of order was raised\nchallenging that the point of\ninformation raised took precedence\nover the procedural motion which\nhad interrupted a speaker to go\nstraight to a vote on an amendment.\nBut then it was all over. Democracy\nhad lost a battle and Council had\nrec com ended that it became the\nsupreme body. Disheartened and\nexhausted, the meeting staggered its\nway to the guillotine and fell apart.\nWe were diss a pointed but not\ndisheartened. It's one thing for a bunch of hacks to vote for their own supremacy, quite another for the\npeople to vote away their\nfundamental right of reply.\nFelix\nWALTER\nWALTER\nOld and new readers of this column\nalike will soon become aware that\nWalter hates to be the bearer of bad\nnews; any subject which might\ncome under this heading he tends\nto treat lightly or not at all. He especially hates to be the first bearer\nof bad news, and it is therefore with\nreal regret that he draws readers'\nattention to the fact that papers for\nthis years circus of sabbatical\nelections will be going up in about\na month, and that the race for\ncandidates is getting under way.\nOne always views the said circus\nwith a certain wry amusement; how\nwill a candidate announce his or her\nintention of standing? Two years\nago, Mr Sydney Harbour-Bridge got\nhis campaign underway by standing for every committee in sight, and storming out of them all\nin turn, carefully explaining why in a signed letter to FELLX afterwards.\nOther people prefer the time\nhonoured method of loudly denying\nthat they intend to stand at all, although those that must be\ndifferent pretend to be Charlie\nChaplin. Don't they, Mr Goodwin?\nSo be warned: if a close friend\nstarts storming out of committees,\nwriting letters to FELIX, pretending\nto be Charlie Chaplin, or most\ndamn ingly of all denying their\nelector i al intentions - take them\naside and talk sensibly to them. Try\nto deflate their ego, to negate the\npsychosis. If all else fails, Walter\nrecommends the use of a gallon of\nparaffin and a match\nAs a break from this incessant\nUnion bilge, more news on the\nAustralian takeover of west London,\nwhich has now reached as far as the\nKw ali ty Tando ori by South Kensington tube station. Walter\nentered this establishment the other\nday to be greeted by a suitably\ndusky gentleman who treated him to a wide smile and the phrase:\n'G 'day mate. This table do yer?'\nOur hero whistled a polite chorus\nof Waltzing Matilda, and retired\nfrom the fray.\nAs an enraged aside, Walter has\njust discovered that if you buy a small portion of grated cheese from\nthe Caterpillar Cafe, it will cost you25 pence. This is a blatant rip off for\nwhat amounts to a small handful of\nI cheap plastic cheddar. Walter\nsuggests a mass boy cot of the\nex h orbit ant place, as only that will\npersuade the con cie nc less profiteers\nin power to recognize the fact of the\nmatter: their catering outlet is\ndisgracefully expensive.

    "content": "Opinion\nThe case for student loans My only disclaimer in this article is\nthat I am not a member of Consoc\nor Indosc. My reason for writing this\narticle is that I feel there is too much\nbias in favour of the anti-loan lobby\nand that this is not a fully\nrepresentative view of the feelings\nof the people in College. This article\nattempts to explore some less\ndebated ideas.\nThe purpose of higher education\nCentral to the loans debate is the\nquestion of the purpose of higher\neducation. The major claims of the\nanti-loans lobby is that the whole of\nsociety benefits from higher\neducation and should therefore\nsub sid is e the privileged few who\nenter into it.\nIn its guidelines published prior\nto the White Paper the NUS quoted\nBruce Johnstone who said 'the\npublic benefits are such as more\nenlightened discourse, lower crime\nrates and more stable economy',\nand yet Britain in the late 1980s with\nmore people than ever before in higher education shows none of\nthese attributes.\nThe concept that educating people\nto a high standard makes them\nbetter people is completely\nfallacious. Student benefits from\nhigher education are said to be one\nor more of the following; more\nmoney, more options and more\ncontrol over life, and I believe that\nthis is predominantly true.\nAcademic Freedom\nA further argument against loans is\nthat it will result in students having\nless academic freedom both in the\ncourses they choose to take and in\n'their right' to pursue thought freely\nwithout pressures from the outside\nworld inter fer ring. However, is such\nfreedom a right? Or is it a privilege\nto be earned? I believe that academia\nmust remain accountable to society\nin general if it is to benefit society\nas a whole, but in the past it has all\ntoo often adopted a clandestine\nivory tower approach giving what,\nif crudely stated, can be said tc be\nno more than a perpetual self ego\ntrip to those within it. How many\nin academia (students and lecturers)\nare aware of the demands that the\noutside world is making? To be\nhonest, industry, commerce and the\ngovernment sector are finding it\nincreasingly hard to find graduates\nand post docs of the appropriate\ncalibre and training to fill their\nvacancies and this is despite the fact\nthat there are supposedly more\npeople in higher education than\never before. Surely this implies that\nthere is something wrong with\nhigher education at the present.\nIt think a turning point is now\noccurring in higher education as the\npower of academics decreases and\nthe demands of society increase,\nand somewhere there must be a balance between the immediate\nneeds of society-and the pursuit of\nacademic freedom which, if the\nprivilege is used properly, benefits\nsociety.\nThese needs of society and the\nworld outside are increasingly being\nmet by vocational and sandwich\ncourses that are becoming increasingly popular with even the\nmost academically gifted students\nand if loans are introduced I believe\nthat this trend will be accelerated.\nThe responsibility of loans\nHaving aired some views on the\npurpose of higher education I now\nwish to consider how this will be\naffected by loans.\nThe anti-loans lobby claims that\nloans will discourage students from\nless well off backgrounds and increase the drop out rate from\ncourses and the time taken to\ncomplete courses. This argument\ntends to centre around the notion\nthat at 18 the average potential\nstudents is too young to take on the\nresponsibility of a loan and the\nworries of repaying it. The White\nPaper as it stands is simply\ntransferring the responsibility of\npaying from parents to the student,\nthe student paying back in relation\nto earnings. With the safeguards the\nWhite Paper details in relation to\nthis, the loans system in terms of\npaying is certainly no more unfair\nthan the current grants system. The\nreason why students object to loans\nis that it entails responsibility. Yet\nas stated near the beginning of this\narticle, I believe students benefit as\nmuch from higher education as does\nthe state as a whole. If students are\nnot responsible enough to face the\nburden of loans are they responsible\nenough to pass through higher\neducation? I believe that entering\nhigher e duct ion at 18 and living in\nacademia for three to four years is\nan insular environment which leads\nto false expectations and a suboptimal use of all facilities available\nin undergraduate life caused by a lack of direction in what one is\ndoing. Basically this is well demonstrated by IC student apathy.\nMany potential students (though\nI think fewer at IC) regard entry to\nhigher education as a right and a time for a 'good dos s' expecting the\nstate to sub sid is e it all. Many students expect the state to pay an\naverage circa \u00a315 per week housing\n| benefit (much of which is illicitly\nobtained) and yet easily spend at\ni least \u00a320 a week plus on entertainments\u2014particularly drinking. Personally I believe this expectation\nis inherently selfish especially when\nunder current tight monetarist\npolicies and ever less cash to go\nround there are many people in far\ngreater need of such benefits. OAPs,\nsingle parent families, etc. For those\nwho don't believe my claims on alcohol expenditure a trip to\nSouthside Bar on a Friday night\nshould be worthwhile. However, I am no killjoy and believe in having\nfun but fun and selfishness don't mix.\n! I think loans will make people\nmore responsible to higher\neducation and more deserving of\nthe places they earn hopefully\nencouraging people to earn with\nmore maturity and experience.\nA balanced education\nHowever, the White Paper does\ncontain one, somewhat disconcerting, aspect which is that\nof tokens to do courses and students\nhaving the power to decide what\ncourses are run. The inherent\n' problem in this is that students may\ndismiss more theoretical or useless\ncourse in favour of more vocational\nones to the detriment of their overall\nunderstanding. This is where the\nfree market policy of higher\neducation collapses and why, as I\" stated earlier, there needs to be a balance between the immediate\nneeds of society as a whole and\nacademic freedom. However it may\nmean that the quality of courses\nimproves as lecturers bid to\nmaintain the popularity of their\nsubjects.\nConclusions\nTo conclude, I believe higher\neducation is a privilege and not a right and that loans will encourage\nresponsibility in students\nencouraging entry at a more mature\nage. This would be of benefit to both\nstudents and society as a whole.\nHowever in such a system more\nsafeguards need to be applied to\nensure a rounded educational\nbalance in options taken and to\nmaintain balance between the\nimmediate needs of society and the\nprivilege of academic freedom.\nJanuary 27 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nSpace Invaders\nOn Saturday Feburary 4, the\nScience Fiction Society will be\nholding its one day Convention,\nPicoCon, in the Union Building.\nWhat is a Science Fiction Convention, and why do people\nwant to talk about SF for the whole\nday?\nAn SF Convention (or to use the\nstandard abbreviations, an SF Con),\nis a collection of SF related events\nthat takes place over a day, or\nweekend (PicoCon is a one day\naffair), where guests come and talk,\nfilms are shown with the general\nidea of having an enjoyable SF\nrelated time. The actual events in\ngeneral cover a very broad range. At the last World SF Con held in the\nUK( the 1987 WorldCon, called\nConspiracy, Brighton), the talks\nranged from discussions of\nparticular authors' work, conversations between authors and\nscientists about how likely their\npredictions were, talks on how to\nwrite SF and, more importantly,\nhow to get published and much\nmuch more. Over five days there\nwere twelve hours of talks each day\nin five separate streams (that's60 hours a day) and that doesn't include the video and film shows.\nKen Livingston even gave a talk on\npossible future politics!\nOf course one area that always\nfascinates SF fans is that of space\ntravel, and many SF writers are in\nfact scientists of one form or\nanother. Dave Brin, who talks to\nICSF last year, is a come try physicist, and the famed Carl Sagan\nhas written science fiction (whether\nthat includes the Cosmos series is\nanother matter). The process also\nworks the other way; Arthur C Clarke is credited for inventing the\nidea of the geostationary\ncommunications satellite. Science\nfiction, in fact, inspires many people\nto go into scientific careers, as I'm sure is true for many IC students.\nThere is also a very strong vein of\nanarchic humour that permeates the\nSF fan world, perhaps due to all the\nstrange and conflicting fur ere s they\nread about, and there are usually\nsome very odd things happening at\nconventions. At the recent Oxford\nCon, Co nine, there was a performance of Fundament a thirty\nminute opera based on Isaac\nAsimov's Foundation saga (not just\nthe first three books but all five!), i The one thing about conventions\nthat you can expect is that the\nunexpected will happen. This\nunfortunately sometimes applies to\nthe guests as well. At last year's University Convention (UniCon) in\nWinchester, the guest of honour,\nPatrick Tilley, left a couple of hours\nafter he arrived, leaving only a short\nnote and a pair of boot laces. Somehow I doubt he'll ever be\nasked to a convention again.\nWhat are SF fans like? Strangely\nenough, and against all the\nsuggestions the media will give you,\nthey are completely ordinary\npeople. They do not dress up like\nDr Who( we leave that to the\n'Whovians' and the less said about\nthem the better), make beep beep\nnoises or try to beam up to the\nEnterprise. However, they are likely\nto be more interested and aware of\nscience than most people, and\nperhaps that is why Imperial has so\nmany SF fans. They are also\nperhaps a little more aware of the\nlong term implications of scientific\nand technological advances, since\nmany have been considered by\nscience fiction writers, and that\ncannot be a bad thing for anybody.\nIn general SF fans are ail very\nfriendly and only too willing to talk\nto others who show an interest in\nSF.\nAnd what can you expect from\nPicocon? Some of the guests are\ndetailed in this article, and there's a provisional timetable as well.\nAmong some of the other activities\ngoing on. the Amateur Rocketry\nGroup needs some explanation.\nSince model powered rockets can\nnow be imported, a group of SF fans\nhave got together to sell them and\nwill be giving a talk on how to build,\nfly, retrieve them, and, most\nimportantly, how not to kill yourself\nwith the things. There will also be\nSF war gaming all day, with Paranoia (apt description) game and\na Space: 1889 scenario (that's the\nnew one about the Victorian space\nexplorers). We' ve got a full\nprogramme of films and television\nSF, and there will be many other\nthings happening that we haven't planned for, as is usual for a Convention. Hope to see you all at\nPicocon next Saturday.\nprolific British SF writers. He's written a vast number of books,\nranging from the near future (eg\nGround Zero Man) to the far future\n(Orbitsville series) and most recently\nto an isolated double world system\nwhere ba loons can act as spacecraft\n(The Ragged Astronauts and The\nWooden Spaceships). He is renowned\namong SF fans for his frequent\n'Serious Scientific' talks (which are\nneither), packing halls at WorldCon\nand Nova Con whenever he gives\none.\nlast year's Picocon and was so\npopular that we asked him back.\nDave Langford\nDave is a reformed Nuclear Scientist\n(see The Leaky Establishment for what\nis definitely not the story of his\nnuclear career!), who now makes a living as an SF writer and fan, and\nis an almost permanent fixture at all\nUK SF Cons. His manic talks are\nvery well worth attending. His most\nrecent book, Dragon Hiker's Guide to\nBattlefield Covenant Beyond Dune's Edge Odessy 2 is a salutary lesson and\nthreat to anyone who ever thought\nabout writing a sequel.\nTerry Pratchett\nTerry is unusual among British SF\nwriters in dominating the Times\nBestseller list with one of his books.\nThis was Mort the latest in his\nexpanding series of DiscWorld\nbooks, which are doing for Fantasy\nwhat The Hitch Hikers Guide did for\nscience fiction. Terry was a guest at\nDave Lally\nDave runs the fan club for that most\nenigmatic television series The\nPrisoner, and promises to be giving\nus a run down on the real spying\nbackground of one of its devise rs.

    "content": "Reviews\nThe Woman in\nBlack\n\"The combination of the peculiar,\nisolated place and the sudden\nappearance of the woman and the\ndreadful ness of her expression\nbegan to fill me with fear. Indeed,\nI had never in my life been so\npossessed by it, never known my\nknees to tremble and my flesh to\ncreep, and then to turn cold as\nstone, never known my heart to\ngive a great lurch, as if it would\nalmost leap up into my dry mouth\nand then begin pounding my chest\nlike a hammer on an anvil, never\nknown myself gripped and held fast\nby such dread and horror and\napprehension of evil...'\n... .and I was merely the audience.\n'It was as though I had become\nparalysed. I could not bear to stay\nthere, for fear, but nor had I any\nstrength left in my body to turn and\nrun away, and I was as certain as I had ever been of anything that, at\nany second, I would drop dead on\nthat wretched patch of ground.'\n....well, seat 27 row M to be\nprecise. Call me susceptible if you\nlike but The Woman in Black (of which\nthe above is an extract) is a ghost\nstory of the chilliest and most\nspine tingling order.\n'Twas a dark and stormy night\nwhen I battled against the elements\nand District Line commuters to get\nto the first preview of this new play:\nStephen Mallarat's adaptation of the\nSusan Hill book. The essence of the\nspooky tale is introduced to the\naudience by means of the\nprotagonist hauntingly recounting\nhis story to an actor whom he has\nengaged to help him present the tale\nof events to a small audience of\nfamily and friends. The motive?\nApparently to explain an (as yet\nun articulated) recent family tragedy.\nWith half an eye for potential theatre\nmanagers, the actor sets about\ntransforming the pedestrian and\noverlong monologue into a two-hand er play, heavily relying upon\nthe wonders of 'recorded sound'\nand the imagination of the audience.\nFor instance, a wicker hamper, first\na desk then railway carriage seat, is\npulled centre-stage; our hero\ngingerly climbs aboard and, to the\naccompaniment of much hoof-clumping and jigging up and down,\nthe 'pony and trap' draws away.\nBy this device the ground work is\nlaid meticulously, if slightly\nlabour i ou sly, but as the two\nrehearse together scenes lengthen\nand the incidence of fatuous\nreferences to Henry Irving decreases. The lighting becomes\nCocktail\nHollywood likes to go through\nfashions and phases, if a film of a certain genre is successful then\nother directors and producers try to\ncash in by grabbing on to its coat\ntails. This is what gave us the\noutbreak of Vietnam movies, a spate\nof baby movies and now we have a series of bar movies that includes\nIronweed, Barfly and now Cocktail.\nBut as the first two are mainly about\nseedy alcoholics in the last stages of\ndestroying their livers, Cocktail is set\nin New York's Upper East Side, a land of fast money and fast sex. Tom\nCruise is ambitious, he gets plenty\nof the the latter but wants plenty of\nthe former as well, so he works as\na barman to pay his way through\ncollege. But here barmen are sought\nafter performers. They throw the ice\nin the air and catch it in glasses held\nbehind their backs while pouring\nthree drinks simultaneously and at\nthe same time deciding which of the\nbeautiful customers they are going\nto screw that night. Mr Cruise is the\nbest of the best in this game. He\nworks with his bar,-room mentor\nplayed by Australian Bryan Brown\nwho spouts bar-room philosophy\nwhile trying to get married to\nsomebody (anybody) that is young,\nattractive and above all, rich. In the\nend he manages to do this and uses\nhis wife's money to open Manhattan's most exclusive and\ntrendy watering holes. He finds\nsuccess and money aren't all he\nthought they were. Meanwhile, Mr Cruise finds true love, accidentally\ngets true love pregnant and loses\ntrue love. When his friend kills\nhimself Mr Cruise is inspired to get\ntrue love back again, for a nice\nhappy ending.\nBasically, this film is little more\nthan another Hollywood crowd\npuller. You can lie back and for one\nhundred minutes or so the film\nwashes over you. Absolutely no\nstrenuous thinking at all is required\nfrom the audience. Technically the\nacting and directing is reasonable\nbut as a whole the film simply does\nnot hold together.\nMike Morton.\n'Sorry, the 6X is off.'\nmore dramatic as the emphasis\nshifts from the telling of the story to\nthe events themselves, characters\nand audience now fully absorbed.\nFinally comes the watershed: A massive expansion of scale,\nemotionally, dramatically and\ntechnically. A staircase, landing and\nnursery are now differential ly illuminated to great effect. A dull,\nrepetitive creaking is heard\noverhead. Through shimmering\ncurtains we see our hero in silhouette, step by deliberate step\nslowly ascending the stairs. Screams\nand apparitions; explanations and,\nof course, the twist in the tale...\n.. .But for that you will have to go\nand see for yourself. I recommend\nthis play unreservedly, and not just\nbecause it provides the perfect\nexcuse to grab hold of the arm of y or( carefully selected) companion. John\nDuttine and Charles Kay gave\ncompelling performances\ncomplemented by a superb\nproduction. This is one not to be\nmissed.\nThe Woman in Black is on at the\nLyric Theatre, Hammersmith until\nFebruary 11.

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nInto the valley of death\nChildren squabbling and fighting in a primary school\nplayground would have displayed more maturity than the\nUnion Officers attending Monday's Council. The meeting\nwas chaotic beyond belief with shouting, swearing,\namendments to amendments and procedural motions\ntaking the place of rational debate - indeed of any debate\nat all.\nAnd amidst the confusion, this bunch of overgrown\nkiddies voted for a half-baked scheme that would abolish\nUnion General Meetings (UGM's) and turn Council into the\nsupreme body controlling the Union.\n'We're the kings of the castle and you (the students) are\nthe dirty rascals!' Heaven help us.\nOn Tuesday next week at 1pm in the JCR, in a move\nwhich reaches new heights in collective absurdity, the\nUnion Executive will ask the U GM to vote for its own\nabolition. They will ask you, the students, to relinquish any\nsay that you have in the way that the Union is run and to\nhand absolute power over to the handful of infant\nmega loma nics who sit on Council. And absolute power\ndoes corrupt absolutely.\nTheirs not to make reply\nAlthough the proposal is the most serious ever to come\nbefore aUG M, the Union have given it very little thought\nand even less debate.\nUnder the proposed regime twenty-five students with no\nparticular qualifications, a very limited ability for rational\ndiscussion, and their own self interests their main priority,\nwill be quite free to ignore a mandate from 4000 students.\nAnd if the mandate involves extra work on their behalf then\njudging from the behaviour of the Neil McCluskys (Council\nChairman) of this world this is all the more likely.\nTheirs not to reason why The executive will argue that unless we abolish UGM's we will be unable to merge with St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool Union. They will say that time-tabling difficulties will\nnot allow the 2 0 0 or so medics resident at the Medical\nSchool time to attend UGM's at the Imperial site on a lunch\ntime. This, the argument runs\", will make UGM's less\nrepresentative.\nGiven the logic of the executive's argument, their\ndecision to abolish UGM's and make the Union totally\nunrepresentative defies any sort of rationality.\nAbsurdity\nTo say that there is no alternative to the abolition of\nUGM's is patently absurd. St Mary's holds its UGM's in the\nevening and manages to rouse a very full attend en ce \u2014why\ncan't IC do the same ? Has anyone considered asking St\nMary's to shuffle parts of their time table? I doubt it. For\nan unofficial committee of ten people to presume that only\nthey know what is best for the Union is extreme arrogance.\nIt is easy to forget that Imperial will gain very little from\nmerging with St Mary's Union, whereas St Mary's stand\nto gain a great deal of money. If it wasn't for this fact St\nMary's would have have absolutely no interest in merging\nat all; like the RSM they are fiercely independent. For the\nUnion office to sacrifice its accountability to students and\nthe democracy of the Union for the benefit of a couple of\nhundred medical students is the height of stupidity.\nAt this point, I suppose the executive would retort that\nstudents are not interested in UGM's anyway. Of course\nstudents show no interest when the Union does absolutely\nnothing to encourage them to attend or even to inform them\nwhen UGM's are about to take place. A handful of posters\nwhen they can be bothered is not really good enough. A few years ago, before each UGM, the Hon Sec would\ngeste tn era complete set of UGM papers which the FELIX\nEditor would allow the Union to place in FELIX. Students\nknew both the date of the UGM and had a chance to think\nabout the issues which were due to be raised. This year\nthere has been one half-hearted attempt at producing an\nExec News; it contained no details of the motions and the\nexec couldn't be bothered to collate it into FELIX. No\nwonder students do not attend UGM's. It pains me to have devote so much space in FELIX to\na proposal which is so blatantly ridiculous. I urge you to\nattend the UGM on Tuesday and vote against this motion.\nThere will be petitions circulated at the U GM copies of\nwhich are available for signing now in FELIX and IC Radio.\nDo not let the Union become a dictatorship.\nThe Union does not consist of the 25 people who\nregularly attend Council, nor does it consist of the\nSabbaticals or the Union Office. The Union is made up of\n4000 students all of whom should have a right to say what\nthe Union does. Do not sign that right away by being\napathetic and not voicing your views at the UGM.\nComment page 11 and page 8\nCouncil Sketch page 19\nThanks to Dave, Sez, Liz, Ramin, Doug, Paul, Steve, Andy, Sumit, Dave,\nJulian for his opinion article on page 8, Wendy, Jason, Mike, Andy, Andy,\nRob, Simon, Cosmic for Space Invaders, Phil, Ralph, Neil, Syd, Walter,\nRose, Dean, the reviewers, Steve, Rugby Club, Christian Union and SF\nSoc for collating last week, this weeks colla tors and anyone I have\nforgotten (Adam).\nIN M K8-3\"\u00a3.cr FiT or| TAK\u00a3-M CO fC^ P\\M C r8oT ri-e coM Ten ri To SS~ <\\\\e TMA\u00a3-i_e. sss.fc,\n&3T2,e ev- GUN\\\nANP ONe 'FR.es H LiQuiDi'seP BA8y...\nOH GOV J fr tAT I5S\\ C KIH K VE VOU\nS \u00a3\u00a3i>T HIS' \u2022TXo? <hO\nv xe?

    "content": "THE . cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nCouncil votes to make itself supreme body\nFarewell to democracy?\nFollowing a heated debate\nMonday night's Union Council\nvoted to abolish Union General\nMeetings (UGM's) by a two thirds\nmajority. The motion, which\nconstitutes a change in Union by-laws, will now be put to the U GM on Tuesday and it will have to be\npassed by a second U GM before it\ncan be taken to the Governing Body\nfor approval. If passed the move\nwill leave Council as the supreme\nUnion decision making body.\nUnder the the terms of the\nmotion, students will be able to\nmandate Council members to\nsubmit motions to Council provided\nthey have 25 second ers. Ordinary\nStudents will be free to attend\nCouncil Meetings, but they will not\nhave voting rights and will have\nspeaking rights only at the Council's discretion. The Hustings U GM for\nSabbatical candidates will be\nreplaced by an elections meeting,\nbut students will still be able to call\nEmergency General Meetings if they\ncollect 150 second ers. The motion was submitted to\nCouncil by the unofficial working\nparty set up to investigate the\nmerger between IC Student's Union\nand St Mary's student's Union. The\nworking party argued that the\npresent U GM system is\nunrepresentative because students\nfrom St Mary's are unable to attend\nUG M's on the IC site. They say that\nthe only viable solution to this\nproblem is to abolish UG M's leaving\nCouncil as the supreme decision\nmaking body.\nThe working party, which has met\nregularly since the start of the\nacademic year consists of 5\nrepresentatives from IC Union and\n5 from St Mary's. The party\ndiscussed the U GM at a meeting on\nDecember 19, for 2 hours, according\nto St Mary's Union Secretary\nGraham Price. Mr Price told FELIX,\n'We've been in student politics a long time and we went away and\ndiscussed the matter for a week\nbefore Christmas until two weeks\nafterwards. Council at IC would\nhave a lot more student scrutiny'\nUnion Deputy President Chas\nBrereton, a member of the working\nparty, said that the party had rejected the proposal that motions\nshould be submitted through the\nConsituent College Union (CCU)\nUG M's because this would create\ndifficulties if motions were to be\nam mended. He added that\nalternating the UG M's between St\nMary'san dIC would also be\nimpractical.\nSpeaking on behalf of a group of\nstudents in opposition to the move,\nPostgraduate Affairs Officer, Dave\nClements outlined his concerns that\nthe new system would make it\ndifficult for students to make their\nvoices heard. He.was particularly\nconcerned that the move would\nallow Union Officers to make\n'decisions behind closed doors'\nwithout being accountable to the\nstudents who elected them.\n'I am disgusted. It is wrong.' he\nsaid, 'The name Students' Union\nimplies that it is an organisation run\nby students for students. The\nremoval of UG M's is a hacks charter\nand would lead to a union run by\nhacks.'\nMr Clements went on to say that\nthe poor attendance at UG M's this\nyear was the result of poor publicity\nby the Union and expressed concern\nthat motions submitted by minority\ngroups would not interest Council\nand would not be given a fair\nhearing. He added that petitions in\nsupport of retaining UG M's are\navailable for signing in the FELIX\noffice or Imperial College Radio.\nUnion President Nigel Baker\nadmitted that it would 'take up too\nmuch time to open Council to\neveryone' and that speaking rights\nmight be a problem when Council\nwas short of time. He went on to\nsuggest that Union Officers would\nbe 'a hell of a lot more accountable'\nto students through links with\nDepartmental and Accademic Reps.\nDeputy President, Chas Brereton\ntold FELIX 'If someone has something sensible to say I would\nhave no hesitation in granting\nspeaking rights, but I cannot answer\nfor the rest of Council.'\nWhen questioned about publicity\nfor UG M's Mr Brereton told FELIX\n'er what can we say? The walkway\nhas been spattered in posters. Exec\nNews could be produced but that\nremit falls to the Hon Sec. There is\na limit to what you can do.'\nComment page 4,8,11\nISSUE 825 27 JAN 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Music\nGlass-ware\nOn the Richter scale of weirdness\nGlass' music is more than a tremor\nbut less than a Tippett. It is part of\nthe minimalist genre, which tries to\nmake music in the simplest possible\nway, that is with the least number\nof themes. The trick is to use the\nsame melody repeatedly without\nletting the music become boring,\nand Glass manages this fairly well.\nHe often takes the theme, stretches\nit out in time and adds it to itself,\nso that we have repetition on two\nor three time scales. The whole\nthing is like the superposition of\nwaves, and this may be why Glass\nlikes the idea of Light. His music is\napproachable by all because it has\nsome dashing good tunes (although\nit is too complex to whistle).\nA characteristic example of his\nwork is the opera Einstein on the\nBeach (CBS Records M4K38875). The structure consists of long Glassy\narpeggios forming the meat,\nseparated by Knee Plays. This is a strange name but the entire opera\nis self-consciously strange. The\nKnee Plays are nonsense texts set to\nmusic. In the first Knee Play we start\nwith a single deep note on a synthesizer to which a chorus of\nfemale voices counting beats in a bar\nis added. After a few repetitions a woman starts counting over the\nchorus and then reads a text which\nstarts 'Will it get some wind for the\nsailboat. And it could get for it is.\nIt could get the railroad for these\nworkers. And it could be were it is.\nIt could Franky it could be Franky\nit could be very fresh and clean...'\nand so on. This first Knee Play is\nprobably the parody of a Bach\nfugue.\nThe musical imagery is quite\ninteresting with three themes\nrecurring throughout. These are the\nTrain, the Trial and the Spaceship.\nThe train represents both the toy\ntrains that Einstein played with as\na child and also the trains used in\nhis thought experiments to display\nthe bizarre effects of Special\nRelativity. In the Trial we are shown\nwhat must have been Einstein's nightmare in which he has to face\nthe terrible consequences of his\nwork on the bomb. The Spaceship\nrepresents another of the standard\nged an ken experiments, and also the\nidea of freedom. Sometimes a solo\nviolin plays arpeggios in the\nforeground set against a complex\nand repetitive backdrop of electronic\nkeyboards and chorus. The violinist\nwas dressed as Einstein in the\nperformance in the New York Met\nbecause, like Sherlock Holmes,\nEinstein was a part-time fiddler.\n\u2022 This is not a recording which I would buy, but it does make a refreshing change from the\nmainstream i.e. Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, The Four Seasons...\nHis latest opera The Making of the\nRepresentative of Planet 8 has been a huge success. It was broadcast on\nRadio 3 on December 12, and is\nbased on a novel by Dorothy\nLessing in which an ice age destroys\nall life on planet 8\u2014a planet not\nunlike our own. The story is very\nmoving, the music's good so if you\ncome across a recording give it a try.\nRam in Nak is a Philip Glass likes his new magnetic boots.\nRock locks\nKERRANG!\nThe Dirty Strangers\u2014Trill Records\nRocky City Angels\u2014Geffen Records\nThe Dogs D 'Amour\u2014China Records\nAlthough these albums have been\non release for about one and-a half\nmonths now, no one seems to have\npicked up on them yet, so I think an\nairing in FELIX will do them no\nharm.\nI 'll start with the Dirty Strangers\nwhich included guest appearances\nfrom Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Phil Spalding. It is clear to see\nwhy Ron and Keith were included,\nas this record is pure early seventies\nStones, it is one of the most blatant\nand sincere of the current set of\nStones rip-off records, that is no\nreason to shun and dismiss it as the\nsongs are fresh, bouncy and often\namusing. This is all good stuff as the\nguitar work is sleazy and growls at\nthe tunes, a perfect complement to\nthe fake cockney of the lead vocals.\nThe Rock City Angels are a young\nAmerican band from Tennessee and\nare another of Geffen Records'\nexcellent pool of mean, talented and\nstreet wise bands, such as Tesla and\nGuns and Roses, in fact the G' N'R similarity doesn't stop there. This is\na superb mix of old white blues and\nmean red neck boogie a la Lynard\nSkynard. The guitar work of Mike\nBarnes and Doug Banx is quite\nconsiderable coming up with lively,\nthrow-away tunes like Hush Child to\nthe haunting classic Mary. The song\nwriting is equally accomplished with\ndeep emotion and though coming\nthrough well is the harsh social\ncomment made in Beyond Babylon.\nOn the whole\" it is a long way\nremoved from the 'get-your-knickers-off-girl-and-have-a good-time' type of song that has become\nexpected of heavy rock music. If\nnothing else this record provides\ngood value, giving you four sides of\nfine music for the price of a single\nLP. Although looking at the Dogs\nD 'Amour one would expect to hear\nsomething like the Motley Crue\nsound, the music contained within\nowes more to the classic white blues\nof the mid- to late sixties and the\nattitude of someone like Hanoi Rocks.\nThe Dogs are a British band who\nhave risen through the clubs and\nhave just beaten their\ncontemporaries The Quireboys to a major record deal.\nAs is vogue nowadays, the vocals\nare grave and strained, though\ntuneful throughout. Again we see\na high level of song writing ability,\nthis time from lead vocalist Tyla, he\ngoes from the bad ass rock ' n' roll\nof Debauchery to the tearful lament\nof How Come it Never Rains. All this\nis thrown carefully on top of the dirt\nsweet guitars of Jo Dog, with a neat\nbass, drum, and sax back to tidy\nthings up with. This could have\neasily been lost on a first album but\nthe production of Mark Dearnley,\nhas held it together, he has been\ncreative though cautious and also\nmanaged to give it a live thrill. All in all probably the best of the three\nLPs.\nDave Williams Well, if the records are half as good\nas the reviews we should soon be\nhearing this dense vinyl from all\nthose good time boys on Radio\nThree. Nice one Dave.\nPage 16 FELIX January 27 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Eviction? Playgroup\nNews\nCentral\nStores\nclosure\nThe College's Central Stores were\nfinally closed on the 16th of\nDecember. This was the culmination\nof plans started in January of last\nyear which were intended to make\nuse of the space for the Chemistry\nDepartment and for the\nInterdisciplinary Research Centre's Superconductor Research Unit.\nStocks are now stored in departmental stores and transferred\nas required by internal requisition.\nThe plan was first announced in\na letter sent to all Heads of\nDepartments on January 7th,1988. A joint Trade Union Committee met\nin March and decided to produce a report in response to this\nannouncement, which was published on April28 th and suggested that the existing stores\nshould be refurbished and reorganised.\nIn a meeting between Heads of\nDepartments on June 1 the College\nand Union reports were discussed\nand it was decided that the\nreorganisation should go ahead. It\nwas felt that the College had gone\ntoo far down the road of stores\nspecializing in numerous fields, and\nthat refurbishment of the preexisting Central Stores was unfeasible. The decision was presented to the Unions in a meeting on June 9 in which the\nCollege Secretary, John Smith,\nstressed that devolving the Central\nStores into departmental stores did\nnot mean an end to central\npurchasing. Stocks would be\ndelivered to the Goods Inward\nsection and distributed to the\ndepartments where they were\nneeded. There were to be no\nredundancies as the seven members\nof staff would be reallocated or put\nin charge of transferring stocks\ninternally.\nIn order to avoid shortages the\nnewly appointed Deputy Finance\nOfficer, Philip Shaw, proposed that\nstocks would be moved between\ndepartmental stores by requisition.\nStationery is now kept on the fourth\nfloor in the Sherfield Building and\nmoved to other stores in all departments as necessary. One of\nthe faults in the new system is the\nduplication of the same goods in several places in College. A spokesman from the College Trades\nUnions told FELIX that a central\nstationery store would probably be\nmore efficient.\nMr Bruce Kent, former President of\nthe Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), spoke to a meeting of the Methodist Society\nyesterday lunchtime.\nAround 80 people attended the\nwide ranging discussion that\ncovered topics from press bias,\nphone tapping and the second\nworld war to US, Soviet and Labour\nParty politics as well as nuclear\ndisarmament. The atmosphere was\ngenerally friendly and Mr Kent later\ntold FELIX that although the\naudience may not have agreed ed with everything he said there was\nnot much disagreement.\nHe argued that the World has\nbecome accustomed to nuclear arms\nand regarded them as a fact of life.\nHe added that nuclear arms are\ndistracting peoples attention from\nthe real issues of pollution, health,\nnational debt and AIDS. However,\nhe was still optimistic and said that\nrecently the situation had changed\n'dramatically'.\nPaid at\nlast?\nStudents who worked on the\nSummer Letting Scheme in Beit Hall\nand Hamlet Gardens last Summer\nare to receive a bonus payment for\ntheir work after waiting 3 months.\nThe Summer Letting Scheme lets\nrooms in College Accommodation\nover the summer and is run by\nstudents. Workers are promised a minimum bonus payment for\nworking the whole summer plus a variable amount based upon the\nscheme's profits and their\nindividual performances.\nCollege Accommodation Officer,\nLoretto O 'Callaghan told FELIX that\na part payment is to be made to\nworkers in Beit Hall subject to a written report from last year's scheme co-or d in at or, Simon Chadwick, whilst those in Hamlet\nGardens will be paid in full. She\nsaid that the delay was due to Mr Chadwick's refusal to submit a report to her, with bonus\nrecommendations. Students who\nworked in Evelyn Gardens will not\nbe paid until Mr Chadwick presents\nhis report.\nMr Chadwick is refusing to\npresent his report until he is paid for\ntwo weeks work which he claims\nthe College has not paid him for. Ms\nO 'Callaghan has now agreed to\nauthorise this payment, and is\nwith old in gMr Chadwick's overtime\nj claim until he presents his report;.\nThe College is considering evicting\ntwo students from its houses in Evelyn Gardens if they do not\narrange for payment of their rent\ntoday. Senior Assistant Finance\nOfficer Malcolm Aldridge told\nFELIX that the-College is legally\nentitled to remove people who have\ndefaulted on their rent.\nIC Union President Nigel Baker is\nunsure what stance the Union\nshould take on the students'\nposition. He told FELIX that the\nCollege had \u00a321000 worth of unpaid\nresidence bills last term. He is\nagainst any action which may\nan tag on is e this problem, which may\nlead to rents increasing in the\nfuture.\nIC Union is considering the opening\nof a Union Playgroup in the Union's Lower Lounge.\nUnion President, Nigel Baker, told\nFELIX that he was making a 'feasibility study' into a Day Nursery with Westminster Council's Child Day Care Adviser.\nIf the idea is approved at IC Union's Council in March, the Nursery will\nbe held in the Union Building'sLower Lounge on weekdays between 9 am and 12 noon.\n25 Children between the ages of\n3 and 5 will be admitted, with\nchildren of students being given\npriority.

    "content": "Wet Union\nDear Bill,\nHow does this sound as a newspaper headline?\n'University Union Politburo abolish democratic\nrepresentation for students'. The Daily Telegraph\nabout the antics of some left-wing students'\nunion? No, actually it will probably be the\nGuardian referring to I CU.I have been informed that, without consulting\nthe student body\u2014ICU Council has proposed that\nUG Ms \u2014 to whom it is responsible\u2014should be\nabolished. One may use the analogy of abolishing\nthe House of Lords. A more accurate appraisal\nwould be the Cabinet abolishing the House of\nCommons. Just because ten per cent of our\nstudents cannot attend UG Ms under the current\nsystem, Council decided that rather than reschedule them they will take the opportunity to\nabolish them altogether. When I asked Nigel\nBaker what was wrong with rescheduling UG Ms to 7pm on Fridays, I was told that this w oud be\ninconvenient for IC students. I make no comment\non that excuse for an excuse. The truth is simple.\nInevitably, since seats on Council are contested\nposts, their occupants will be people of an ambitious and egotistic nature. How frustrating\nit must be that there are regular UG Ms at which\na mere three students can present motions critical\nof them. Wouldn't it be wonderful if UG Ms didn't take place (fewer embarrassing\nre val at ions!) while increasing the number of\nsecond ers required to 25 should help crash any\nremaining dissent. It is now easier to form a society than to criticise Council.\nThe final stage in the removal of accountability\nis, of course, gagging FELIX. Council now want\nto make FELIX directly accountable to U GM s.Oh, of course, UG Ms are going\u2014FELIX would\nbe directly accountable to Council. Perhaps we\nwill see on Friday mornings 'FELIX\u2014the organ of\nIC Union'. I think I 've made my point. It would\nappear that a healthy dose of Glasnost (and not\na little Perestroika (spell?\u2014TS), i.e. restructuring\nof the Union) are required.\nThe motion has to be passed by two UG Ms. No doubt, if the usual poor attendance continues,\nit will be passed. Attend aUG M; they're an\nendangered species, and this may be your last\nchance to see one.\nSimon Bradshaw, SCC Vice Chairman.\nRant with a hole\nDeor Bill,\nI am writing concerning the 'Students Against\nLoans' posters put up by Water Polo Club around\nCollege both before and after the Christmas\nbreak.\nI'm no Union hack but I can tell that these\nposters break Union rules. Campaigning against\nstudent loans is obviously nothing to do with\nwater polo, and so the money given to Water Polo\nClub by the Union cannot be spent on campaigning against loans.\nWhat makes things worse is that this has been\ndone with the full knowledge of Ian Morris. I Letters\nthe posters that they are breaking Union rules,\nbut he has also told them that he will take no\naction against them because he supports their\ncampaign.\nNow this is hardly professional behaviour from\na man who wants to 'consider how best to project\nthe Union' and who claims to be 'not so\nimmature as to wreck the Union from within'.\nYours,\nAshley Unitt (Computing 3).\nHonour Shock\nDear Bill,\nI am writing this letter to bring to light a great\nevil that has been committed in this wonderful\nworld of ours. I refer ,of course , to the recent\nomission in the New Years Honours List.\nI was shocked to see that the names of \" Mad\" Nige Whitfield and Tom Cunnington were left\noff the list. The accomplishments and great her ioc deeds of these two men must surely rank\namongst the finest in the known world. Who can\nforget the incident in the winter of 88 with the\nferret and the apple on the stick?

    "content": "Opinion\ninterested in sponsoring a student\nwill not be interested in extracurricular activities as they are not\nlooking for a broadened character\nbut a character specialised in the\nparticular vein that will suit them.\nThe result will be a dramatic\nreduction in the activities of the\nStudents' Union, an increase (if\npossible) is timetabled hours and the\nloss of a mind broadening education.\n10. Get out of London completely.\nThis would enable IC to continue to\nrun in exactly the same way. It\nwould undoubtedly cost a considerable sum as the College is\nnot allowed to sell the London site\noff to a non-academic tenure\nwithout Royal consent.\n11. Relocate part of the College\nactivities on the outskirts of London.\nThis is what is being proposed by\nthe merger with Royal Holloway &\nBedford New College (RHBNC).\nThe proposal at the moment would\nappear to suggest a split site\ninstitution under the name Imperial\nCollege with research and major\nlaboratory work based at IC and\nteaching facilities based at RH B NC. This would mean that only\nresearch and third/fourth year\nstudents need to be based at the\nSouth Kensington site. This is\naround 2,500 students from IC plus\naround 500 students from RH B NC. Of these, the College could house\naround 2,000 students at the present\nrents .By selling off some of the\nmortgaged property, the rent might\nbe reduced to an average of \u00a330 per\nweek. This would save the average\nstudent at the South Kensington\ncampus around \u00a3200 per year. It\nshould be noted that many of the\nstudents would be postgraduate\nresearch students who would be\nbetter located out of London as they\nare not free in the summer to take\nup jobs and supplement their\nincome or to get out of London to\nreduce their costs. The situation on the IC campus would still be one of\nhigh expense and the housing\nproblem, although improved, would not be solved.\nOther effects of the merger would\ninclude:\na) Large transport costs for\nstudents and staff who need to use\nfacilities on the other campus, eg\npostgraduate demonstrators,\nlecturers and students requiring\nlaboratory space.\nb) The cost of living in Egham, the\nlocation of RH B NC, may be less\nthan South Kensington, but the\ndifference is not all that significant.\nIt is rumoured that the University\nFunding Council will support the\nmerger by funding extra student\naccommodation in Eg ham. If\nsufficient money is put in this could\nbe of considerable benefit to\nstudents at Egham.\nc) The distance between campuses\nwould doubtlessly result in uneconomic use of staff and student\ntime. Timetabling problems would\nbe immense and it may become\napparent that to overcome the time\nlost in travel it is necessary to\ntimetable more activities at one time\nthat there is space available for. This\nwould mean extra cost in creating\nmore space through building programmes.\nd) The effect on the Students'\nUnion could be disastrous. The\nEgham site would doubtlessly have\na lively social atmosphere, but the\nSouth Ken site would deteriorate\ninto a hive of academia and very\nlittle else.\nClubs and societies will find if extremely difficult to operate under\nthis situation. One society cannot\noperate from two campuses that are\nso far apart. If two societies were to\noperate from the different sites it\nwould be far worse than at present\nas the experienced people, capable\nof running the societies and teaching new-comers, will be at\nSouth Ken and all the new-comers\nwill be in Egham.\nThe effect of Arts students upon\nthe politics of the Union will mean\nthe moderate and apolitical nature\nof IC will be destroyed. Art's students will dominate student\naffairs in the new college. This is\nlikely to mean that IC will become\njust another college of ranting\npoliticians who miss the most\nimportant topic: the needs of the\nstudents.\ne) An improvement in the\ncharacter of the College will be\nunavoidable, as the presence of Arts\nstudents and an improved sex ratio\nwill lead to the establishment of a more balanced community. This\nmay improve recruitment in the\nfuture.\n12. The College, or possibly the\nUniversity of London, could oppose\nthe proposed, student loans system\non the grounds of un work ability and the likely to effect on Higher\nEducation in London. This would\nonly be a short term solution unless\nthe College was willing to fight for\na more realistic London grant at the\nsame time.\nI do not like the thought of any of\nthe above, but favour a well thought\nout, united and careful approach to\nthe last point. I fear that an ill-informed University Funding Council has already decided that\nmoney can be saved by merging IC\nand RH B NC and that we will find\nit difficult to stop this merger now\nI also feel that the RH B NC merger\nhas not been at all well thought out\nand will be considerably less\nefficient than two independent\ncolleges. I would be interested to\nhear the College Secretary's views\non the matter.\nTell me what the\nfuck is going on?\n'Request for information!' screamed\nSteph Snell. 'Will somebody tell me\nwhat the fuck is going on?' This was\none of the many insane comments\nmade on Monday night at Imperial\nCollege Union's longest running\nfarce - Council. Monday's performance turned out to be\nsomething of a dramatic classic with\nSydney Harbour-Bridge resigning\nfrom one post, only to put himself\nforward to take up another, petty\ninsults being traded around the\nroom faster than a stock market\ncrash, Andrew Meredith (RCS\nA AO) voting both for and against\nthe same motion and Cosmic (alias\nDave Clements) storming out in a tantrum, setting an example as to\nhow mature post grads should\nbehave.\nThe reason behind this chaos lies\nin a report put forward ICU Exec\nand St Mary's Exec which, among\nother things, suggests that Council\n(yes, the childrens' c rec he I described in the first paragraph)\nbecome the policy making body of\nICU. This proposal does two things.\nFirstly it removes the right of\nstudents to vote and talk on issues\nconcerning their future and the\nfuture of this college. Secondly it\nhands over these responsibilities to\na few people, most of whom were\nnever even voted into their positions\nof power, but elected unopposed.\nThe majority of the debate, when\nnot dedicated to petty bickering and\nrattle throwing, centred around how\nthis 'supreme' Council would go\nabout notifying its student\n'populace' as to what decisions it\nhad made, instead of actually\ndebating as to whether or not a student's right to speak and vote\nshould be removed.\nHowever when a motion was\nfinally put forward giving students\nthe right to speak at Council it was\ndefeated by a large majority. Also\nwhen, at last, Nigel Baker asked\n'Whether Council believed that the\nabolition of UG Ms was too great a price to pay for a merger with St\nMary's', Council decided that it was\nnot and promptly voted tp abolish\nUG Ms by a large majority.\nThe next question to be asked is\n'why did Council vote this way?'\nThe answer to this can be gleaned\nfrom a comment made to me by\nGraham Price, secretary of St\nMary's Union. He said, \"The thing\nthat has always angered me about\nthese meetings (Council) is the\ncomplete insecurity of the people\npresent.' From this, one can deduce\nthat the people on Council are there,\npossibly, to boost their egos and\nsatisfy their megalomaniac\ntendencies. So it comes as no\nsurprise that they should vote\nthrough a motion giving themselves\nsupreme power over Imperial\nCollege Union.\n'Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely'\nLord Acton, 3rd April 1887\nDEFEND UGM's Would you like a student's union which\nwill:\n\u2022 spend your money without your consent\n\u2022 make decisions behind closed doors\n\u2022 consist of Union Officers who do nothing and get away\nwith it\n\u2022take actions in your name behind your back\n\u2022 be accountable only to itself\nNO?\nSign the petitions in FELIX, IC Radio and STOIC to\ndefend UGM's from abolition.

    "content": "Opinion\nView from\nThe survival of IC as an institution\nof excellence is dependent upon its\nability to recruit high standard\nstudents and pump out higher\nstandard students into industry and\ncommerce. The matter of producing\nhigher standard students is one for\nanother opinion article but it is a fact\nthat over the past four years the\naverage entry grades at IC have\nbeen steadily falling and that the\ncost of living in London is a topic\nstudiously avoided at all costs\nduring interviews with prospective\nstudents.\nIn view of the increase in the cost\nof living in London over the past six\nyears, the changes in Government\npolicy towards education which\nhave already cost the average\nLondon student approximately \u00a3200\nmore a year and the reducing value\nof the grant in real terms, which is\nonly worth 85% of what it was six\nyears ago, it is the opinion of the\nauthor that student finances will\nbecome the pre domine nt factor in student recruitment in the future.\nThe following set of figures aim to\ndemonstrate that Imperial is in a very poor position to attract\nstudents on grounds of financial\nbenefit.\nYearly cost of essentials for student year (Oct to July)\nLondon Student\nRent = \u00a347.59 x41 week (39 during term and short holidays\nand two over the summer) / \u00a31947.50\nFood = \u00a320 x31 weeks (total term) \u00a3620.00\nBooks and stationery = \u00a3140 \u00a3140.00\nOther equipment = \u00a380 \u00a380\nTransport and travel:\nParental home to College = \u00a350\nTo and from College daily = \u00a3150 \u00a3200.00\nClothes and laundry \u00a3200\nTOTAL \u00a33187.50\nNon-London Student\nRent = \u00a327.50 x41 weeks \u00a31127.50\nFood = \u00a317 x29( average term length outside\nof IC \u00a3493.00\nBooks and stationery = \u00a3140 \u00a3140.00\nOther equipment = \u00a380 \u00a380\nTransport and travel:\nParental home to College = \u00a350\nTo and from College daily = \u00a350\n\u00a3100.00\nClothes and laundry \u00a3150.00\nTOTAL \u00a32090.50\nThe difference in the cost of living is around \u00a31,000 per year. However\na London student may benefit from an extra \u00a3350 grant and is eligible for\napproximately \u00a3400 (on average) more housing benefit than a student in a provincial university. This means London students pay an extra \u00a3250 per\nyear to be educated.\nNeither group will gain housing benefit under the new student loans\nscheme and hence the Extra Cost of a London Education (ECLE) will jump\nfrom around \u00a3250 to \u00a3650 per year. The Government aims to freeze the\ngrant through the loans scheme; the effect of inflation on the larger costs\nin London will mean that, at present rates, the E CLE will increase by \u00a365\nper year until such a time as the Government deems it appropriate to reassess the grant.\nA further matter that is not taken\ninto account in the above figures is\nthat of entertainment. This is not\nsomething which interests the\nGovernment; as in their eyes,\nstudents should not be spending\nmoney on being entertained. It is,\nthough, a matter that should\nconcern the College.\nStudents entering colleges such as\nIC have worked hard and long to get\ntheir grades and wish to learn a little\nmore about life than can be read in a book. They will spend money on entertainment and will broaden\ntheir education in doing so; the cost\nof this will influence their choice of\nuniversity or college.\nLondon may have the widest\nrange of entertainment in the\ncountry but it is also the most\nexpensive in the country. A trip to\nthe cinema in London will cost\nnearly double what it would at a provincial university; a pint of beer\nis one-and-a quarter to one-and-a half times the cost of the same beer\nin the North of England; a theatre\ntrip is generally too expensive to\nconsider.\nLondon students are often unable\nto afford the entertainments that\nstudents at other universities enjoy.\nWorse still, having worked hard at\nschool and not enjoyed this time as\nmuch as they might have done, they\nfind that even their peers who are in\nlow paid jobs can afford to spend\nmuch more on entertainment.\nShould the price for becoming\neducated and improving the\ncountry's prospects be three years\nsolitary confinement during the\nprime of your life? The way things\nlook, it could be this way for many\nstudents at IC unless they are\nwilling to accept an even larger\noverdraft.\nAs potential students become\naware of the effect that London will\nhave upon their social life and/or\ntheir pockets recruitment figures at\nIC will fall. \u00a31000 a year is an\nincomprehensibly large figure for a17 year-old who is trying to decide\nwhich university to go to.\nI see the College as having a series\nof options. If IC is to stay in London\nwe must look at adapting the\nCollege to make us more attractive\nto potential students; we cannot\nreduce the costs of London, but we\ncan try and make life here better\nvalue for money.\nSuggestions\n1. Cut timetabled hours, saving\ncosts and releasing staff time for\nother activities, releasing student\ntime for greater appreciation of\nLondon and enjoyment of cheap\nUnion-based entertainment or to\ntake up part-time jobs to\nsupplement their income.\n2. Re-direct staff time towards\ngreater research to increase the\nacademic reputation of the College.\n3. Research into graduation salaries\nfor students from department to\ndepartment and compare with other\ncolleges. If salaries and employment\nrates for graduates are not high, the\nCollege should do something about\nthem as they are crucial if we are to\nrecruit students.\n4. Coordinate an informed and honest recruitment drive from each\ndepartment, with emphasis on those coming from families who are\nable to afford to support their\nstudents, sponsored students and\nthose who are very dedicated.\n5. Invest time in the gradual\ndevelopment of Alumnus links with\nthe department by providing an enjoyable and more relaxed\nenvironment for work. Ex-student\nsupport in the areas of recruitment,\nemployment or sponsorship will not\nbe forthcoming if they do not enjoy\ntheir time here, or if they are\nforgotten for twenty years and then\ncalled back to a dinner with people\nthey never knew and at this point\nsqueezed for a quick buck.\n6. Invest money in the Careers\nService, as this is vital to the future\nof the College. Prepare the service\nfor a heavy demand for vocational\njobs.\n7. Help the Students' Union to\nnegotiate student deals with industry and commerce to help\nstudent funds.\n8. Reorganise many of the jobs in College so that they can be done by\na series of students as part-time\nlabour.\n9. Turn the College into a sponsorship based college. The idea\nis that students will only be accepted\nonto courses if they are sponsored.\nThe departments would have to\nspend a considerable amount of\ntime negotiating mass sponsorship\ndeals with industry to try and corner\nan even larger section of the market.\nThe effects of this would be:\na) Students at IC would be able to\nafford to live in London and would\nprobably have vacation jobs to\nsupplement their income.\nb) Students that came would have\nto be completely sure of what they\nwish to do in life and sure that it\ncoincided with what their sponsors\nwanted.\nc) It is likely that much of RCS and\nRS M will cease to exist, due to a difficulty in finding sponsorship,\nleaving ' Imperial College of\nEngineering and Medicine'.\nd) Courses would be heavily\naffected by industrial and commercial demands and as a result\nacademic freedom would be\nseverely damaged.\ne) It is likely that companies\nJanuary 27 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
