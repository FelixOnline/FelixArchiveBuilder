In these articles, I often preach\na humanist approach to photography,\nand what this form of art means to us as\na community and as individuals. Nevertheless, as winter fades away and I sunbathe in Dalby Court, I would now rather\nfocus on a completely different part of\nphotography: landscapes.\nWhile often looked down upon by\npretentious photographers, critics, and\namateurs such as myself, landscape photography is no less important than any\nother uses of the medium. It is a way to\nremember places we have been to and\nsceneries we have enjoyed, sometimes\nin a childish or naive sense. This genre\nis also why many people get into photography in the first place; they want to\ncapture the awe of jaw-dropping moun-tainscapes or incredible feats of human\narchitecture and engineering.\nHere I present two landscape photos,\nthe first of which is one of my favourite\nphotographs of all time. Grotto in an Iceberg (1911) by Herbert Ponting was taken\nduring Scott\u2019s infamous Terra Nova Expedition, of which Ponting was the official\nphotographer. It most perfectly portrays\nthe cold and inhospitable South Pole,\nrepresenting one of the 1000 still images taken during the expedition. Another,\nadmittedly more famous, version of this\nphoto exists, where Ponting poses two of\nhis colleagues at the entrance of the grot-to. Comparing this with Grotto in an Iceberg would give an interesting perspective on how the senses of scale change.\nIn a very naive way, we can associate\nthis photo to the past winter, which may\nbe a banal interpretation, but still a completely valid one. As I feel the sunrays\nhitting my skin, I wish to celebrate the\nchange of season, so here is something\nto remind us of the upcoming summer:\nThe Great Blue Hole by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, an activist-photographer who has\ndedicated himself to many successful environmentalist projects such as the widely famous The Earth from Above (1999).\nFor Yann, the tranquillity and peacefulness of this picture is something we need\nto protect: \u201cMan is part of nature. We\u2019ve\nforgotten that\u201d. His website collects hundreds of other astonishingly beautiful\npictures, and I have never seen such a\nlarge body of work containing so many\ntruly impressive photographs.\nIn both of these pictures, the objective is to inform rather than to provoke.\nTo narrate or to document is a pure intent because photography is, first and\nforemost, the art of seeing. Thus, in the\ngrandiosity of these landscapes, we are\nreminded that a great picture is not necessarily a thought-provoking master-piece, but could simply be a portrayal of\nwhat is around us, as sometimes all that\nbeauty needs is to be captured by a lens.\nIt is in that same way that I suggest we\napproach this year\u2019s change of season:\njust look around and take a great picture.\nSeasonal Landscapes\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nNo more overthinking, just enjoy the sun\nScan the QR code to\nsubmit for the next\ntheme \u2018Smells like\nhome\u2018:\nGrotto in an Iceberg Herbert Ponting\nThe Great Blue Hole Yann Arthus-Bertrand\n\n"

It signals the paper\u2019s intent to report fairly,\nhonestly, and comprehensively.\nThe Washington Post, famed for breaking the Watergate scandal that brought down US President Nixon, only\nadopted a slogan in 2017. The paper\u2019s former executive editor Marty Baron describes the process in a piece for The\nAtlantic: \u2018Staff teams were assembled. Months of meetings\nwere held. Frustrations deepened. Outside branding consultants were retained, to no avail.\u2019\nIf you look at the front page of this paper at the mast-head, you\u2019ll see our very own motto, \u2018Keep the cat free\u2019\n.\nLike the NYT\u2019s slogan, ours is open to interpretation,\nand until this week, I hadn\u2019t the story behind how it came\nabout.\nIn my three-and-a-half years at the paper, I\u2019ve heard\ntwo explanations of what Felix\u2019s motto means and as it\nturns out, both are true.\nOn Tuesday, I spoke to Michael Llewellyn-Williams,\nFelix Editor from 1974 to 1975. Llewellyn-Williams, now a\nprofessor at San Jose State University, recounted the story\nof Felix\u2019s 25th anniversary, and how it eventually led to the\npaper\u2019s motto.\nAhead of the anniversary, he invited editors from years\ngone by to a commemorative dinner. The founding editor,\none Ted Hughes, was unable to make it, but the paper\u2019s\nsecond-ever editor \u2013 Cliff Hargreaves \u2013 did attend, together with several others (see image above).\nA number of former editors were unable to join\nthe group and sent their regrets. \u201cOne letter,\u201d says\nLlewellyn-Williams, \u201ccame from an editor \u2013 I can\u2019t recall\nhis name now \u2013 but he signed it off with \u2018Keep the cat\nfree\u2019\n. And that\u2019s where that slogan\ncame from.\n\u201cThere were two reasons\nbehind it. I think the editor\nwho wrote that was making a\nplea that Felix should not have\nto be paid for. [Felix cost three-pence, rising to sixpence before\nthe fee was abolished altogether\nin 1971.]\n\u201cBut the other reason, and why\nI adopted it as a slogan was... my dear friend\nTrevor.\u201d\nSir Trevor Phillips now hosts Sunday Morning on Sky\nNews, but in 1974, he was President of Imperial College\nUnion.\nTogether with the Felix Editor, the\nUnion President was (and still) is a sabbatical officer \u2013 meaning a student who\nhas just graduated or taken a year out of\ntheir studies to serve in the role as a paid\nmember of staff.\nBut Phillips had other ideas, says\nLlewellyn-Williams. \u201cHe had a thought\nthat the sabbatical part of the editorship could be taken away from the Felix Editor and given to another Union\nofficer. So that\ncaused a bit\nof alarm.\u201d\nThe plans\namounted to\nnothing in\nthe end, says Llewellyn-Williams, but they left their\nmark on Felix\u2019s eventual\nslogan: \u201c\u2018Keep the cat free\u2019\nwas kind of, keep it free\nfrom Union pressure.\u201d\nThe first unveiling of the catchphrase was at the paper\u2019s 25th Anniversary Dinner, when it was used as the final toast, but it wasn\u2019t until some\nyears later that \u2018Keep the cat\nfree\u2019 was adopted as Felix\u2019s\nmotto.\nIn 1977/78, Llewellyn-Williams paid for a Felix Editor Honour Board to be made. \u201cThis inevitably led to the question of what was\nto go at the top of the Board \u2013 the Imperial College crest with its motto, or\nsomething else?\u201d\nIn order to maintain the paper\u2019s claim\nof independence from Imperial College\nUnion, a separate Felix crest was creat-ed. \u201cI remember seeing dozens of designs before coming up with the one\nthat exists now,\u201d says Llewellyn-Williams.\nIn the final issue of that academic year\n(#488, 16th June 1978), then-Felix Editor\nDuncan Suss used the crest together with the \u2018Keep the\ncat free\u2019 slogan as a full front page, marking its first appearance as the paper\u2019s motto.\nLlewellyn-Williams can\u2019t recall when the slogan appeared on the Felix masthead but he observes: \u201cWhile the\nmasthead went through various changes, somehow the\nmotto endured.\u201d\nThe Felix 25th\nanniversary dinner in 1974, containing the paper\u2019s first reference to the \u2018Keep the cat free\u2019 catchphrase. Felix #371\nFelix #370\nThe Felix Honour Board once hung in\nthe old Felix offices, but now resides in\nthe Union Dining Hall. The crest at the\ntop contains the motto, \u2018Keep the cat\nfree\u2019\n. Felix\n\n"

The Annual Sustainability\nReport 2022-23 recommits to achieving\nnet zero for their operational emissions\n(about 20% of Imperial\u2019s total) without\noffsets by 2040.\nImperial\u2019s decarbonisation strate-gy, created by consulting firm ARUP,\nlaunched in March. The strategy includes\ncommitments to get off Combined Heat\nand Power for good by 2030 and to switch\nto heat pumps in district heating systems\nacross South Kensington, North Acton,\nand White City. Where there aren\u2019t heat\npumps, Imperial is investing in them,\nand where buildings aren\u2019t energy efficient enough for heat pumps the College\nplans fabric improvements to enable\ntheir use.\nImperial signed off on the fully-costed\nplan, committing \u00a31-1.5 billion to decar-bonisation over the next 16 years. The\nstrategy explains how, by 2040, the College will avoid emitting 519,500 tonnes\nof CO2\nequivalent, and reach net zero operational emissions excluding transport.\nDespite recent improvements, Imperial\nhas the highest emissions per full time\nstaff and students among UK universities\nand is in the top five total by operational\n(scopes 1 and 2) emissions.\nAs part of decarbonising Estates,\nWhite City South will be a zero fossil-fu-el campus and a heat pump has been installed at the Clinical Research Building\nat Hammersmith Hospital. New major\ndevelopments will be Building Research\nEstablishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) rated or similar\nfrom this year on. There are plans to electrify the\nfirst-floor\nkitchens in\nthe Sherfield Building. Electrification\nof kitchens\nis an improvement\nnot just\nfor emis-sions, but\nalso means\nc o o l e r\nk i tc h e n s\nfor staff.\nI n\nterms of\nprocure-m e n t ,\nwhich is\nabout half\nof Imperial\u2019s scope 3\n(indirect)\nemissions,\nall major\nsuppliers will be assessed on their environmental policies by this September.\nSustainability criteria now form 20% of\nthe criteria by which big suppliers to Imperial are assessed. Most of the emissions\nfrom our labs are part of procurement,\nbut Imperial is on target for all labs to be\nengaged in an efficiency programme by\nsummer 2026.\nThe College\u2019s ICT is 30% of total emis-sions. The ICT team plans to work on\nbaselining power consumption across\ncampus to\ngive them\nb e t t e r\nknowledge\nof where\ne n e r g y\ncould be\nsaved and\nswitching\noff devices\nwhen not\nin use.\nT r a v e l\nis a major\nsource of\nImperial\u2019s\nemissions,\nwith business travel\nmaking up\n10% of total\nemissions\nand student\ntravel an\neven larger portion.\nI m p e r i a l\naims to reduce emissions from air travel by 25%\nper staff full-time equivalent by 2025-26.\nThe College is also exploring carbon pricing to address the remaining emissions\nfrom commuting and business travel. On\nWednesday the College published its new\nSustainable Travel Policy. The two main\nrecommendations of this policy are that\njourneys taking less than five hours by\ntrain should be taken by train instead of\nflying, and remote work should be priori-tised wherever possible.\nAnother source of carbon emissions is\nour diets. Beef is much more carbon-in-tensive than other foods, and Imperial\nhas reduced the amount of it on its menus by 47%. The College plans to eliminate\nbeef fully from menus by 2025-26. Cooking oil consumption has also decreased\nby 50%.\nStudent and staff engagement on sustainability is ramping up. This year we\u2019ve\nhad Sustainability Fortnight, hosted the\nLondon Student Sustainability Conference, and continued to be involved in\nStudents Organising for Sustainability\n\u2013 not to mention student societies and\ncampaigns. Imperial aims to further engage people in these events and eventually run a mandatory sustainability induction course for staff, following a climate\nliteracy staff course planned in autumn.\nDespite major efforts to decarbon-ise, Imperial continues to invest in fossil fuels. They commit in their Socially\nResponsible Investment Policy to using\ntheir relatively \u201cmodest\u201d endowment to\ninfluence fossil fuel companies\u2019 behaviour and engage in \u201cregular, honest, assessment of progress, rather than rhetoric\u201d with the same industries which hid\nclimate science from the public for dec-ades.\nNonetheless, Imperial\u2019s new sustainability policy is a good reason to get excited about decarbonisation on campus.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001a\u0016\u001a\u0013\u0012\u0015\u0011\u0013\u0015\u0016\u0019\u0014\u001c\u0015\n\u0010\u000f\u000e \u0010 \u0015\u0011\u0013\u0012\u0012\u001c\u0016\u0015\u0013 \u0015 \b\n\u001c\u0015\n\u0019\u0012\u0007\u0015\u001b\u001c\u0019\u0006\u0005\u0015\u0012\u001c\u0011\u0015\u0004\u001c\u001b\u0013\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001b\u001c\u0017\u0018\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001d\u0016\u001c\u0019\nIs Imperial trying to emulate President Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act?\nFIND THE BRANDNEW DOCUMENTS\nHERE!\nSTUDENT &\nSTAFF TRAVEL\n(37%)\nFUEL & ENERGY\n(3%)\nPROCUREMENT\n& SUPPLY\nCHAIN (38%)\nNATURAL GAS (15%)\nPURCHASED\nELECTRICITY\n(6%)\n\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001d\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001f\n\u0014\u0013\u0014\u0014\u0012\u0014\u0011\u001f\n\u0010\u0018\u0019\u000f\u000e \u001f\n\u001a\u001c\u001d\u0015\u0015\u001d\u000e \u0015\n\n"

The roles are\nvoice-casted to reflect the personalities of the charac-ters: Orpheus, the spirited youth, is given the voice of\na high tenor; Eurydice and Persephone, the headstrong\nwomen, are given powerful mezzo roles; Hermes, the\nnarrator and Greek Chorus, is given a rugged voice\nfull of soul and passion; and finally Hades, master of\nHadestown, challenges the depths of the human vocal\nrange as a low bass.\nAs soon as the lights dimmed, we are greeted by Melanie la Barrie as Hermes \u2013 sauntering on stage in a glorious ensemble of sky blue and white \u2013 who beckons at\nthe audience \u2018ALRIGHT!?\u2019, to which we enthusiastically respond \u2018ALRIGHT!\u2019. At this point we burst into the\nopening number, a glorious symphony of soul where we\nare reminded that the play we are about to see is \u2018an old\nsong\u2019. The band were on superb form for the whole play,\nnot a single missed note, and despite the sometimes virtuosic nature of the score, they still maintained a pure\naura of charisma and cool.\nFor the remainder of the first act, we see the interactions between Donal Finn\u2019s Orpheus and Grace Hodgett\nYoung\u2019s Eurydice play out, both seamlessly acting out the\nyoung and innocent love between the two characters, all\nthewhileweseeHadesandPerse-phone in the background on their\nbalcony above the cast and crew.\nThroughout the play we also are\nserenaded by the smooth silky\nharmonies provided by the Fates,\nplayed by Bella Brown, Madeline\nCharlemagne, and Allie Daniel,\nwhose rendition of \u2018When the\nChips are Down\u2019 had me enam-oured. Hades, played by Zachary\nJames, sings his glorious rendtion\nof \u2018Little Song Bird\u2019, although having been listening to Patrick Paige\nsing it an octave lower for so long, it felt a little less powerful and temptuous than his rendition.\nThe second act was where we were shown the full capabilities of the staging set-up. A fully functioning two\nwheel revolving stage and vast mechanically moving\nbackdrops meant no scene was static; the perpetual motion of every character meant that finally, when Orpheus\nlooked back, the immediate cease of movement from\nthe stage and the characters, in combination with the\nblinding light, stunned many in the audience. It goes to\nshow that even a story so familiar as Orpheus, where we\nknow the inevitable tragic ending, can still shock us and\nmake an audience gasp with upset when done with a\nstellar cast and expert staging. As we are reminded time\nand time again, \u2018it\u2019s an old song\u2019, but what Hadestown\nproves \u2013 and proves well, judging from the audience\u2019s\nreaction \u2013 is that even an old song sung again and again\nwilll not lose its impact when done with such a pristine\nrevitalisation.\nI urge you all to see Hadestown while it lasts in the\nWest End. It is a true testament to what a musical made\nin the 21st\ncentury should be: not a cheap, lazy rendition of a feckless love tale with angsty rock songs, but a\nheartfelt, masterfully composed work of pure melodra-ma. If there\u2019s one thing Hadestown proves, is that what\nwe want is more musicals just like it.\nWay Down and\nSent to Heaven\nARTS\nHadestown, and the\nreturn of the classic\nmusical\nArtsEditor\nGILBERT JACKSON\nOrpheus and Eurydice find eachother in Hadestown Hadestown Gallery\nThe Fates and stage crew Hadestown Gallery\nEven an old song sung again\nand again willl not lose its\nimpact when done with\nsuch a pristine revitalisation.\n\u201c\n\n"

The acclaimed\nmusic producer\u2019s foray into writing is meant as a\ntool to help artists, regardless of their level, develop an\nunderstanding of their own artistic process. Rubin\u2019s\ndecades of experience with musicians, from the Red\nHot Chilli Peppers to Ye (the rapper formerly known\nas Kanye West), are proof that he knows how to help\nand encourage a variety of artists. Neither strictly self-help nor purely non-fiction, The Creative Act straddles\nbetween the two genres. As if engaging in a conversation with Rubin himself, the book provides a sense of\npeace and solace in the beauty and uncertainty of creating art.\nAlthough I am not currently engaged in any artistic\nprojects, during exam season, The Creative Act served\nas a timely reminder that I did not need to be making\ntangible creations to be an \u2019artist\u2019, and especially that\ncreativity transcends the conventional definitions of\nproductivity which have been drilled into us from a\nyoung age. I found Rubin\u2019s discussions about mindfulness particularly compelling. Buried in textbooks\nwhich drained my time and energy, I saw The Creative\nAct as a nudge to re-engage with the real world: to take\nin the sounds and sights of my surroundings and use\nthem for rejuvenation. Moreover, I sometimes found\nRubin\u2019s tips versatile and applicable to individuals\nacross diverse stages of life, making this more than just\na book about the creative process (and thus \u2019a way of\nbeing\u2019).\nThe opening segments of the book feel effete as Rubin aims to reiterate the power that art holds, trying to\nbring its enigmatic capabilities into words. The book is,\nas Rubin acknowledges himself, a collection of \u201978 areas\nof thought\u2019 rather than a structured guide. While the\nlack of structure gives the book a fluidity that makes\nit easy to melt in and out of, it comes at the expense of\nreaders being able to actualise Rubin\u2019s strategies and te-chniques.\nAs the book progresses, though, Rubin actually\ndelves into direct strategies to nurture creativity and\nself-management during the artistic process. However, at times, The Creative Act also reads like a poorly\nwritten set of A-Level Philosophy essays, filled with\nvoid but intriguing assertions. Most chapters \u2013 often\none page \u2013 can simply be distilled into one-liners like\n\u2018be authentic\u2019, \u2018build constructive habits\u2019 or \u2018\u201cfailure\u201d\nis okay\u2019, none of which are particularly groundbrea-king. These surface-level ideas are thrown around,\nthen repeated, and Rubin swiftly moves on even before you realise he has finished the first tangent. Even\nthough the book contains an abundance of anecdotes,\nthey often feel generic due to the anonymity Rubin\nprovides his clients and therefore do not resonate.\nConsequently, these factors make it difficult to retain\nRubin\u2019s suggestions. I imagine I would have to undertake multiple readings to fully comprehend and absorb his suggestions. Unfortunately, it also veers into\na style reminiscent of Rupi Kaur, where half-senten-ces masquerading as poetry fall short of actual reve-lation.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t dislike The Creative Act, I felt that\nRubin disappointed in his ability to evoke emotional\ndepth and provide a clear message, both of which undermined his execution. I believe that other books with\nsimilar objectives and better execution exist. Nevertheless, given its accessibility, dipping your toes into The\nCreative Act to see if it works for you could just re-ignite\nyour artistic fire.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001c\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001c\u001d\u0016\u0017\u001d\u0016\u001a\u0015\u0014\u001e\u0015\u0013\u001d\n\u0012\u0014\u0011\u0010\u001d\u0012\u000f\u000e\u0014\u0017\u001d\u0015 \u0014\u0017\u0010\u001e\u001d\u001e\u0018\nBOOKS\nAditi Mehta explores\nthe depth of Rick\nRubin\u2019s creative guide.\n\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001a\u0019\u0016\u001d\u0015\u0017\u0016\u0019\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0013\u0017\u0014\u0013\u001d\u0017\u0016\u001d\n\u0018\u0011\u0019\u001d\u0010\u0019\u0016\u0018\u001d\u000f\u0012\u000e\u001d\u0018\u001b\u001d\u0019\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0013\u0019\n\u201c\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0019\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001d\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001c\u001f\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001e\n\n"

This was not the only noteworthy rendering of a song: \u2018I believe\u2019 was performed beautifully by the ensemble \u2013 including Clarisse Bonacina,\nAlvin Chung, Aleera Ewan, Solen Marqueste, Hannan Seyal, and Averen Turay \u2013\nbut as this coincided with the onstage sex scene, the audience may not have fully\npaid attention to the cast\u2019s brilliant talent at this point. While this particular scene\nwas originally close to rape, the co-directors wisely softened this, so it became a\ngentler, more sensual experience for both characters. However, it turned out that\nJack Finnis\u2019 and Michael Langton\u2019s characters (Hanschen and Ernst) were the only\ntwo who ended the musical on a happy note, even as the two actors wrestled with\nthe script to turn a stereotyped love story into something sweeter.

The choreography of the two instances of slapping was not entirely realistic, and at times the\nactors were hard to hear: but no doubt that was down to faulty equipment, and would\nhave been much worse if someone other than Josh Henry had been designing sound,\nand someone other than Joshua Gray had been musical director.

For this reason, these animals are often\nused in promotional materials for zoos and conservan-cies to garner sympathy and attract donations.\nA prime example of this is the use of the giant panda\n(Ailuropoda melanoleuca) used in the World Wildlife\nFund\u2019s (WWF) logo. The cuddly, charming bear has been\nan icon of the organisation for more than 60 years;\nits \u2018endangered\u2019 IUCN conservation status \u2013 recently\ndowngraded to \u2018vulnerable\u2019 \u2013 serves as an\nappropriate reminder of the importance of the\nWWF, and other such conservation efforts. The\npolar bear (Ursus maritimus) is another iconic\nbear species that has become synonymous with\nthe impacts of global warming; imagery of them\nclinging onto diminishing ice floes has repeatedly\nbeen used in climate-change-activism media.\nDespite this, there is an ongoing debate about\nwhether such attention is actually helpful for conservation and biodiversity. Some argue that focusing attention on these attractive species overshadows\nless-charismatic ones. This often causes the latter to be\nneglected by conservation efforts, and sometimes even\nhave negative attitudes towards them perpetuated.\nThere is no denying that stunning photos of\ncharismatic megafauna are a powerful resource\nfor charities, zoos, and non-profits looking to\nattract funding and visitors, and content featuring these\nanimalsismorelikelytobepromotedbynewsoutletsand\nsocial-media algorithms. Charismatic megafauna can be\nsimilarly useful for attracting ecotourism \u2013 experiencing\nwildlife in its natural state \u2013 which typically provides\nmarked economic benefits for local communities and\nconservation efforts.\nUnfortunately, the economic benefits offered\nby charismatic species might incentivise\npreferentialtreatment.A2021reportfromwildlifecharity\nBorn Free found that UK charitable zoos spent less than\n10% of their funds on in-situ conservation, with most of\nthem going towards developing new exhibits. The conclusions of conservation research are mixed; one study\nfound that, in Italy, the \u2018more appealing\u2019 bird species tend\nto have a better conservation status. Another study highlights that although consumer advocacy for charismatic\nmarine species is useful for promoting conservation,\ncharisma is not a sufficient\ndriver for widespread\nreversal of biodiversity decline in\nthe oceans.\nA third paper concludes that media representations of\ncharismatic megafauna can create false perceptions\nof their abundance, which the study claims hinders\nconservation communication efforts by downplaying\nthese animals\u2019 extinction risk and need for conservation.\nAdditionally, the activity associated with mass\necotourism can even be detrimental to other parts\nof the species\u2019 ecosystems. Excessive jeep or boat\ntraffic that\nallows tourists\nto get up close\nand personal\nwith charismatic\nmegafauna, for example, can damage populations of\nsmaller local animals and insects, and the surrounding\nhabitat. Their visual appeal can even cause charismatic\nmegafauna themselves to be exploited for commercial\npurposes or targeted by poachers, putting them at greater\nrisk of endangerment.\nSupport for charismatic megafauna might\nstill be warranted given that many of them are top\npredators or keystone species in their ecosystems,\nproviding benefits such as population regulation and\ninsights into ecosystem health. An example is the value\nelephants offer as ecosystem engineers, transforming\ntheir habitats by trampling undergrowth and clearing\nforest through their natural movements, which can\nlet light into overgrown areas and promote growth.\nComparatively, although the giant panda is held in\nhigh regard for its unique appearance and charm,\nit offers little-to-no benefit to its ecosystem,\nconsuming a single food source and largely\nnot being self-sufficient. Insects, on the other\nhand, hold high value in their synergistic roles as\npollinators and decomposers, despite typically being\ndisliked or neglected.\nIt\u2019s tricky to say for certain whether charismatic megafauna\u2019s contribution is a net positive or negative. Whereas the use of charismatic megafauna for promotional and\nfundraising purposes appears to be effective, it is also evident that this can be misleading and detract from wider\nconservation issues. It is important for all elements of\necosystems to be valued in equal measure, and to not neglect species that look less attractive or seem less important than\nothers.\nIs conservation a beauty pageant?\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\nThe subtle prejudice in fundraising for wildlife preservation\n\n"

Common drugs developed include small molecule drugs (e.g. aspirin), vaccines,\nbiological medicines (antibody drug conjugates,\nnucleotides, etc.), and emerging therapies such as\nimmunotherapies. Chances are, you interact with this\nindustry\u2019s products daily. These drugs and therapies\nhave huge commercial value, with Yahoo Finance ranking the industry as the 20th\nlargest worldwide. In 2022,\nthe industry generated \u00a31.18 trillion ($1.48 trillion) in\nrevenue, about \u00a3150 per person globally. This continual\ngrowth means pharma attracts scrutiny for perceived\nprofiteering, especially evident in high drug prices during a drug\u2019s early lifecycle.\nBig pharma, big margins?\nThis notion seems valid, with giants like AstraZeneca reporting $8.3 billion in profit in 2023, and Pfizer,\nthe industry leader in revenue, reporting $58.5 billion.\nHowever, substantial operating costs and the slim probability of a drug successfully reaching the market are\noften overlooked. For instance, Pfizer reported a 41%\noperational decline in year-on-year earnings from\n2022, primarily due to the success of their COVID-19\nvaccine drying up. AstraZeneca\u2019s $8 billion profit\nagainst $45.8 billion revenue in 2023 equates to an 18%\nprofit margin, lower than industries like Big Tobacco (47.8%) or the rental market (33.3%).\n\u201cBeing a little fish in a big pond\u201d\nMedium and smaller-sized pharmaceutical companies\nface even greater challenges. Alnylam, a newer entrant\nfounded in 2002, reported\na net loss of $440 million\nin 2023 despite leveraging\nRNA interference (RNAi)\ntechnology and being re-cogni- sed among\nF o r b e s \u2019\n1 0 0\nmost innovative\ngrowth companies in 2016. This\nreflects the harsh reality of an\nindustry where regulatory\nagencies halt market\nentry after billions\nof dollars and\ndecades of de-velopment.\nWith only\none in 30\ndrugs successfully\nmaking it\nto market,\nthe few that\nsucceed must\ncover the losses\nof numerous failed\ncandidates.\nBusiness is business\nTo sa- feguard their inventions,\npharmaceutical companies file for\npatents early, typically lasting 20\nyears, granting exclusive rights to\nproduce and sell their products. The average time for\ndrug development and market introduction ranges\nbetween 10 to 15 years, leaving a narrow window of\nfive to ten years to recoup investments before competitors introduce \u2018biosimilars\u2019. Developing one drug\ncan cost between \u00a31 to 2 billion, which must be recouped alongside any losses from failed candidates before turning a profit. After a patent expires, a typical\n66% price decrease is expected within\nfive years. Many promising therapies\ndo not receive backing, solely based\non their profitability if they make it to\nmarket. This affects treatments for less\ncommon diseases or specific genetic\nmutations, like niche cancer treatments\nsuch as immunotherapies.\nScientists need to find\nsomething both innovative and\np r o f i - table, or t h e i r\nwork may be rejected.\nWhile the industry\u2019s issues impact consumers\nwho have no alternative but to pay, can\nthis solely be blamed on \u2018big pharma\u2019, or is it a\nproblem with the\npatent system and\ninformation sharing\nin the scientific com-munity?

Co-directors Jasmine Ajaz and Nathalie Tedfors Lindell clearly poured\nheart and soul into the blocking, casting, and vision of this production; the story\nwas conveyed without a hitch, painting a picture of a 1890s German village where\nteenage girls are told about the reproduction cycle in terms of storks delivering ba-bies, and stifled teachers preside over all-boys classes chanting Latin-like automa-tons. When the songs began, pent-up emotion poured forth, exquisitely conveyed\nthrough Amy Thorton\u2019s stunning choreography, which was one of the highlights\nof the show.\n\u2018Mama Who Bore Me\u2019, the opening song, might have been one of the better musical numbers in a score which included some questionable lyrics, but the skill of the\ncast and crew was consistent throughout the production: Cecilia Longoni, playing\nWendla, sang her way through frustration about her own ignorance, an abrupt destruction of that ignorance, and a return from beyond the grave in a voice as clear as\nwater from a spring. Her onstage lover, Oli Keene as Melchior, likewise blew the audience away with their voice, emotional range, and performance as a resolute atheist and nihilistic rebel. In a similar vein, Daria Ditri\u2019s and Jonny Williams\u2019 characters\n(Ilse and Moritz respectively) had only the briefest of chances to convey an achingly\ndoomed relationship, but both actors rose to the challenge admirably.\nA fine line has to be walked between expressing young, lustful urges and making\ntheatre, but Jasmine and Nathalie managed to strike a certain balance between the\ntwo, though some audience members were unprepared for the depths Spring Awakening is prepared to skinny dip into. From the script, I gathered that the point of the\nmusical is to hold up prudish, close-minded ways of thinking and demonstrate what\ngoes wrong if young adults are kept in the dark about sexual maturity, puberty, and\nall the emotional baggage they entail. Nonetheless, the script does this in a very explicit way, and is quite polemic in its depiction of bisexuality, its portrayal of sexual\npractices, and its commentary on consent, among other sensitive topics. Love is\nportrayed as an awkward, dangerous force, sometimes as the first step on a path that\nleads to fatal consequences, and while this musical runs no risk of being didactic, it\nwould benefit from answering more of the questions it raises about the vulnerabilities of growing up.\nThis is all the more relevant given the varied hurdles the teenage characters face,\nsharply juxtaposed with the fact that only two cast members play all the parts of the\nadults, including parents and teachers, which is a clever playwriting device \u2013 these\nwere Jay Etim and Alfie Grimshaw as Adult Woman and Adult Man respectively. (Note\nthat Jay had had all of two weeks of being an adult, which made their portrayal of oppressive religiosity all the more impressive.)\nThe minimal set worked well with the close-minded, stifling atmosphere the teenagers are shrouded in, and the scene changes were described simply and elegantly;\nfor example, soulless classroom changed into peaceful forest through the addition of\nbranches hanging under the proscenium arch and leafy lighting design, showcasing\nthe harmony the stage manager (Liberty Wright) and lighting designers (Jarek Ciba\nand David Liu) were working in. There\u2019s a moment when set and music collide wonderfully during the number \u2018Totally F**ked\u2019, and hidden mechanisms spewed illustrated letters detailing the intricacies of losing one\u2019s virginity across the stage, which I\nassure you is entirely within keeping of the plot.\nMTSoc rocks\nSpring\nAwakening\nArtsWriter\u0003\nSOPHIE R.

We\u2019re seeing a mushrooming of projects across the tropical belt which were established without any consultation or free, prior, and\ninformed consent of the local communities. That\u2019s\ncausing conflicts in and between the communities\nand the companies, and it\u2019s doing very little to stop\ndeforestation because these projects are not properly\nconceived.\nIn that context, what kind of solutions\ndo you propose that would both preserve\nbiodiversity and mitigate climate change\nbut also celebrate indigenous communi-ties?\nThe first thing is rapid decarbonisation in the Global\nNorth and supporting tropical forest countries to forge a\ncleandevelopmentpathway.InplacesliketheDRC,where\nonly a fraction of the population has access to electricity,\nwe need policy imperatives that enable the country to\nharness its enormous potential in renewable energies\nsuch as solar energy and localised hydroelectric projects\nto leapfrog fossil fuel-dependent energy networks.\nThe second thing is supporting local and indigenous\ncommunities on the frontline of tropical deforestation.\nThat means helping them to secure rights to their land,\nwhich is a prerequisite to fair and effective forest protec-tion. We should then support them to monitor and protect their lands through low-cost, simple technologies\nand to develop sustainable livelihoods in those areas, so\nthey can be the drivers of their own development.

Basing targets and policies on\nscience still sounds good if this science\nincludes indigenous wisdom. The trouble is, it often doesn\u2019t.\nRainforest Foundation UK (RFUK) is\nan organisation dedicating to protecting\ntropical rainforests by championing the\nrights of indigenous communities. The\ncharity empowers local communities\nin Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nGhana, Peru, Republic of Congo, and Kenya. Felix spoke to Joe Eisen, RFUK\u2019s executive director, about the experiences of\nindigenous people who live in rainforest\nareas being used to offset pollution generated in the West.\nHow have fossil fuel companies treated marginalised and\nindigenous communities?\nThe development of fossil fuel projects\nin the tropical forest belt can have pretty severe impacts on local communities.\nIn the Congo Basin, which is the region\nthat we\u2019re most involved in, fossil fuel\nprojects have led to economic and physical displacement of local communities.\nThe promised trickle-down benefits, in\nterms of jobs and taxes and so on, often\nfail to materialise in any sustainable\nway in the local communities. In other regions where you have a very long\nhistory of fossil fuel extraction \u2013 places\nlike the Nigerian delta \u2013 the effects have\nbeen extremely severe on multiple lev-els.\nAt the moment, the governments of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo\n(DRC) and the Republic of Congo are trying to attract fossil fuel companies. For\nexample, the DRC government has auctioned 30 oil and gas blocks \u2013 many of\nwhich overlap with tropical forests, protected areas, and the ancestral lands of\nthousands of communities.\nCan you tell me a bit more\nabout the role that indigenous\ncommunities have to play in\nclimate action?\nThe founding principle of the Rainforest Foundation is that the best way\nto protect tropical forests is to entrust\nthem to the communities that live in\nthem. It\u2019s been increasingly borne out\nby the science that the areas under the\nformal control of such communities\nare better managed, better protected,\nand deliver more economic, social, and\necological benefits. For years, the prevailing conservation model promoted\naround the world was one of fortress\nconservation \u2013 the idea that you could\nprotect areas of wilderness through\nguns, guards, and fences. Not only does\nthat have social and environmental\nimpacts on communities themselves,\nit\u2019s also less cost effective. A lot of the\nwork we do is to try and push for laws\nwhich recognise the rights of indigenous and other communities to protect\nforests, and then equip those communities with tools they need to defend\nand manage those lands. Indigenous\ncommunities play a critical role \u2013 the\nchallenge now is to support them to se-cure, protect, and manage their lands at\nthe scale necessary to avoid the worst\nimpacts of climate change.\nWhat do you know about the\nScience Based Targets Initiative, and how do they prevent\nthat from happening?\nWe don\u2019t really work so much on sci-ence-based targets. On the face of it, it\u2019s\na framework through which the private\nsector can make tangible, concrete steps\ntowards reducing their emissions and\nthat is important.
