    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nThe weather is cold and fresh, the\nsky is bright and there are some\nflurries of snow swirling around my\nhead. Strangers smile at me in the\nstreet as they scrape ice off their\ncars. And Silent Alarm, the debut\nalbum by London art-school types\nBloc Party, is being pumped into\nmy head by those famous white ear-phones. It is all too perfect, and\nbrings a tear to my eye.\nThis album really is that good. It is\nso exciting and forward looking, yet\nso \u201cthe sound of now\u201d. Whether it\u2019s\nobserving the interweaving guitar\nand vocal harmonies of Helicopter\non MTV2, feeling like you\u2019re hearing\nsomething that shouldn\u2019t see the\nlight of day for another decade in the\nform of the dark, techno-fueled comment on mental illness that is She\u2019s\nHearing Voices, or just plain getting\nyour groove on down the club to the\nthumping Banquet, you cannot, nor\nshould you want to, avoid Bloc Party.\nAny discerning fan of the alternative\nmusic scene will be well aware of\nthese songs already, so let\u2019s delve\ndeeper into this album.\nCheck out Positive Tension, a\nsparse and moody song, with spacey\nguitar effects squelching around\nyour head, before guitarist Russel\nLissack goes all Johnny Greenwood\nand rocks you into oblivion, as bass-ist/vocalist Gordon Moakes intones\n\u201csuccess\u201d over and over again. Or\nthe opener Like Eating Glass, with\nthose awesome drum rhythms you\nusually find in electro songs, vocal-ist/guitarist Kele Okereke yearn-ingly yelping \u201cI cant eat I can\u2019t sleep\n/ I can\u2019t sleep I can\u2019t dream\u201d, and\nyou just melt. Price Of Gasoline is\nincredibly dense and dark, sounding\nlike something dredged from the\ndeepest trench of London\u2019s dirty\nnew-wave scene (for those in the\nknow think Lomax).\nNone of this however can prepare you for their quieter songs.\nMany of you will already be familiar\nwith latest single So Here We Are,\nwith drummer Matt Tongs post-rock\nsnare drumming, and the climactic\nchorus (when it finally arrives) of\nKele shouting \u201cI\u2019ve figured it out\u201d.\nBlue Light is a tender tale of love\nlost and coming to terms with it\n(\u201cif that\u2019s the way it is, then that\u2019s\nthe way it is\u201d), with the feeling of a\nheart-break resolved being poignantly echoed in the music.\nBut best of all, and probably the\nstandout track on the album, is\nThis Modern Love. Kele\u2019s voice is\npanned around your head through\nlight distortion, playing call and\nresponse with himself before gently\nbegging \u201cbaby you\u2019ve got to be more\ndiscerning, I never know what\u2019s\ngood for me / Baby you\u2019ve got to\nbe more demanding, I\u2019ll be yours\u201d,\nthe last phrase sang in breathy harmony by the rest of the band. Then\ncomes military drumming, and a\nsimple yet moving repeated guitar\nriff, with glockenspiel lovingly laid\nbeneath it. The drumming gradually\nbecomes more complex as the band\nharmoniously sigh beneath Kele as\nhe sings \u201cThis modern love breaks\nme / This modern love wastes me.\u201d\nThe song builds towards the end as\nthe two guitarists perform the most\nrestrained guitar sparring ever\nheard, and drops right back down to\nKele\u2019s call and response motif.\nDespite the fact that this album\nis about three songs too long, it\nis almost this generation\u2019s OK\nComputer (and I\u2019m a huge\nRadiohead fan). Unfortunately I\nthink it will age quickly. The music\nscene it emerges from is changing\nso rapidly. Fortunately I cannot see\nBloc Party ever getting tied to one\nsound, so we will be graced by their\npresence for many years to come.\nJames Millen\nProg-rock! The genre (with its silly\nname) is often associated with\nimpenetrably complex time signa-tures, stop-start rhythms and splitting headaches as a result of both.\nYeah I know, original journalism,\nwell what do you expect? I\u2019m not\npaid to write this crap. OK any-way, De-loused In The Comatorium\ncame along a couple of years ago\nand everyone went crazy with how\namazing it sounded. It was a completely indefinable experience, and I\nwas scared that the follow up would\nnot even compare in greatness. I lay\nawake at night crying at the thought\nthat they would turn into a rap-reg-gae band with 12 minute baboon\nsolos. So now with this, their 5 song\n77 minute opus, I am ready to go\nthrough the sleepless nights again\nbecause this album is challenging\nand obtuse but ultimately rewarding\nand never disappointing.\nFor those who have little patience,\ntolerance and demand immediate\nresults (in other words, Americans),\nbeware for this album unravels its\nideas, narrative and purpose slowly\nand almost painfully. It is an album\nthat you will either love or hate, this\npartly explains its brilliance as we\nall know that universally approved\nalbums are always bland and hard\nto feel passionate about. The psychotic genre hopping and guitar\nsoloing is a reflection on a colourful\nlife\u2019s worth of drug abuse, death and\nfrustration. Some see the obscure\nlyrics and awkward music as a way\nto obscure their humanity but Omar\nand Cedric are intelligent, complicated and challenging individuals.\nBy reflecting this in the music they\nare exposing their true selves and\nnot a watered-down version.\nOpener Cygnus\u2026Vismund\nCygnus, starts with a plaintive\nacoustic guitar and characteristic\nCedric croon and out of nowhere, the\nguitars and drums enter and sound\nunforgiving. There is increased\nLatino influence with both the opener and L\u2019Via L\u2019Viaquez employ LatinAmerican rhythms that drive the\ntracks with great swing. After all,\nOmar and Cedric said that they\u2019d\nrather have people swing their hips\nto their music than pogo. The Mars\nVolta sound has moved completely\naway from At The Drive-In, where\nthere is no real trace of Fugazi\ninspired punk-rock which has lost\nall meaning for them and they refer\nto it as \u201cjock-rock\u201d.\nThe album has three facets, the\nslow plaintive side demonstrated\nby The Widow and Miranda, That\nGhost Just Isn\u2019t Holy Anymore\nwhich both seem inspired by the\npassing of Jeremy Ward and surpasses Televators for its emotional\nimmediacy. The other sound is the\nmentioned Latin-American influenced rhythms and thirdly there\nare the post-rock sounding \u201cnoodling\u201d bits and jamming which colour and break up the former sounds.\nCassandra Gemini is the culmination of all these facets and may feel\nunordered but order is never fun or\never really human. They refuse to\nbe anything except themselves and\nfor that they have produced a truly\ninspirational album.\nMatty Hoban\nSINGLE REVIEW\n\u201c\u2019Mon tha Biffy!\u201d Biffy Clyro have\nprovided the best live sets I\u2019ve ever\nseen, closely challenged by Muse.\nUnfortunately, the bane of every\nindie elitist\u2019s life, popularity, has\nhit Simon Neil, and the brothers\nJohnston like a big Kerrang! shaped\ntruck.\nAfter their second album, The\nVertigo Of Bliss, things seemed to\ngo a bit crazy in camp Biffy. There\nwas the download-only single\nThere\u2019s No Such Thing As A Jaggy\nSnake which, despite sounding like\nthree blokes screaming over the top\nof a snake charmer\u2019s melody, beat\nreleases by Avril Lavigne and Keane\nto the top of the download chart.\nThey then released their new album\nInfinity Land, with singles Glitter\nAnd Trauma (skittery alt-rock), My\nRecovery Injection (accessible emo-style rock) and now Only One Word\nComes To Mind. What does their\nnew single sound like? Well, I\u2019ve\nheard it compared to The Smiths.\nBright guitars jangle, drums bounce\nalong, and they show off their triple\npronged singer attack with some\nnifty vocal harmonies. It\u2019s got a tune\nlike no Biffy song since their debut\nalbum Blackened Sky. and then,\nrandomly, at the end it explodes\ninto a heavy metal riff! Bonkers. It\u2019s\nbound to bring even more black clad\nteenagers into their ever-increasing\nfold. And after years of being one of\nthe most exciting underground rock\nbands in Britain, they deserve all\nthe success they will get.\nJames Millen\nBloc Party on Mars, anyone?\nForgive the bizarre headline, but two of the best albums of the year so far are reviewed\nbelow.

He looked\nunflustered as the charges\nwere read out \u2013 no doubt he\nhad heard them numerous\ntimes before.\nThe allegations were based\non computer evidence, quoted\nand repeated several times by\nJohn Hardy, appearing for the\nUS government. As this was\nan extradition hearing, the\ndefence was unable to challenge any of the evidence in\ncourt, and so its reliability was\nnot discussed. The evidence\nquoted included email communications with a person on\na US naval ship \u2013 the dates of\nwhich, according to the Free\nBabar Ahmad campaign, coincided with Mr Ahmad\u2019s wedding day and his honeymoon\non a remote island without\ninternet access. Also quoted\nas evidence was a publicly\navailable documentary DVD\non 9/11.\nEdward Fitzgerald QC, for\nthe defence, stated the risks\nfacing Babar if extradited to\nthe US, the first being indefinite detention as an \u2018enemy\ncombatant\u2019, which would\ninvolve \u201ca flagrant denial of\nthe principles of justice\u201d.\nThomas Loflin, a Supreme\nCourt attorney and expert in\nUS criminal law, appeared\nas an expert witness for the\ndefence having submitted\ntwo affidavits to court. He\nstated that there was a real\nrisk that Mr Ahmad would be\nturned over to the military\nas an \u2018enemy combatant\u2019. If\nso, he needn\u2019t even be given\na trial.\nUnder Military Order\nNumber 1, the only trial available to him would be by military commission, to which\neven evidence obtained via\ntorture would be admissible.\nThe Order expressly forbids\nappeal to any other court. A\nmilitary commission could\napply the death penalty. He\ncould be handed over to the\nmilitary as an \u2018enemy combatant\u2019 even if tried and acquitted in a civilian court.\nMr Ahmad could be\ndetained in Guantanamo Bay,\n\u201cor worse\u201d, according to Mr\nLoflin, who also referred to\nprisons in other countries\nsuch as in Afghanistan, Egypt\nand Pakistan. The \u2018Doctrine\nof Specialty\u2019, which prevents\nan extradited person being\ntried for offences other than\nthose he was extradited for,\nwould not apply in such places since they are outside US\nterritory. Mr Loflin also commented that \u201cUS courts have\na somewhat elastic view of\nthe Doctrine of Specialty\u201d.\nEven if not declared an\n\u2018enemy combatant\u2019, Mr\nAhmad could be subject to\n\u2018Special Administrative Measures\u2019, regardless of whether\nhe is convicted or awaiting\ntrial. Under these measures he could be indefinitely\ndetained in solitary confinement and have restrictions\nplaced on his contact with\nlawyers.\nMr Loflin then mentioned\nthe possibility that if Mr\nAhmad was tried in a civilian\ncourt, the death penalty could\nstill be applied if prosecutors\nseek a superceding indict-ment, for example combining a conspiracy to murder\ncharge with a murder charge\n(which can carry the death\npenalty). He also expressed\ngrave doubts that Mr Ahmad\ncould get a fair trial by jury\nin America, citing attacks\nand discrimination against\nMuslims after 9/11.\nMr Loflin further affirmed\nthat a written assurance that\nthe death penalty would not\nbe applied had to come from\nthe top if it was to be effective\n\u2013 that is, from the President\nor the Attorney General.\nThe opposing lawyers could\nnot agree on whether declaring Mr Ahmad an \u2018enemy\ncombatant\u2019 would be a breach\nof the Extradition Treaty.\nIn the end Mr Hardy agreed\non what the potential consequences were if Mr Ahmad\nwere handed over to the mili-tary, but would not agree on\nwhether there was a real risk\nof this happening.\nAt noon on the trial\u2019s second day, Mr Hardy asked the\njudge for a further two to three\nweeks to gather more evidence to support his case by\ninteraction with the US gov-ernment. This was granted,\nand the trial was adjourned.\nIt was agreed that a review\nand remand hearing be held\non 24 March 2005, via a video-link with Mr Ahmad.

    "content": "LIVE REVIEWS\nIt was my first time at the Spitz\nand I was really impressed. It\u2019s a\nfive minute walk from King\u2019s Cross\nstation and really easy to find. We\nwalked through the blistering cold,\npast the old Spitalfield market and\ninto the Spitz. As I entered, a restaurant greeted me with warm gusts\nof gastronomical delights. I ignored\nmy urge to steal someone\u2019s plate of\npasta and proceeded up the stairs to\nthe venue.\nThe venue is awesome and holds\nabout 250 people. Its white walls\nare separated by oak beams which\nreach up to the high ceiling. The\nroom is surrounded by a cushioned\nbench \u2013 handy if you\u2019re a lazy git like\nme. The stage was lit by purple and\nblue spot lights; simple but classy.\nWhen we got there it was starting to fill up and shortly after the\nfirst band came on - the Scottish\nband Half Cousin. I was watching\nfrom the \u2018wings\u2019 and watched as\nthey proceeded to carry on half a\nradiator, part of a shopping trolley,\nan old electronic drum kit (the kind\nyou can buy from Argos), and an\nold blue metal locker. To be honest\nI expected at worst some sort of\nexperimental noise bollocks. What\nwe got was phenomenal: the lead\nsinger, clearly an accomplished gui-tarist, finger picked his way through\nsome delicate and beautiful riffs. He\nmade me laugh though; he was so\nScottish Indie he could have joined\nBelle & Sebastian and no-one would\nhave noticed.\nHis gorgeous voice shut me up\nthough. I don\u2019t yet know what it\nsounds like on record but live it\nwas ethereal. The rest of the band\nkicked in; the drummer looked like\nHagrid from Harry Potter, his huge\nunkempt beard shaking as he furiously battered his unconventional\nkit. Using the radiator and office\nchair leg (set up on a cymbal stand)\nas substitute cowbells (a wise decision as they provided the same high\npitched percussive element but qui-eter, shorter and sharper), Hagrid\nbust out some strange break-beat/\nrock-beat hybrids. As he was cymbal\nand high-hat shy the beats sounded\nsparse and though loud and powerful allowed the more graceful guitar\nand vocals to shine through. The\nbass player was also an integral part\nof the band playing heavily distorted\nbass lines, but in short bursts again\nnot suppressing the vocals. At the\nsame time he used his foot to hit the\npads of the aforementioned electric drum kit, adding another layer\nof percussion. The band was completed by keyboard player who also\nadded percussion by drumming on\nthe big blue locker they brought\u2026 I\ndon\u2019t know why but it sounded mint.\nThey finished their set with a solo\nacoustic song, got up and packed\ntheir gear into the big blue locker.\nDIY efficiency at its best.\nThe night was going well by my\nstandards, and I tentatively waited\nfor Hood to come on. I was also\nunsure about how exactly they\nwould put together a live show that\nwould meet the high standards that\nthey set on their records. Hood is\nan ever-evolving collective. Over\ntheir nine albums of work (of which\nI have heard four) their musical\nstyle changes covering many genres\nincluding indie rock, electronica and\nhip hop. Indeed their universally\nacclaimed Cold House is blessed by\nthe presence of hip hop experimen-talists cLOUDDEAD on no less than\nthree tracks. Their line up reflects\ntheir recording career with a very\nlong list of temporary members.\nFounding members Richard (vocals\nand guitars) and Christopher Adams\n(bass) are joined by Stephen Royle\non drums as a permanent member,\nand aided by Mark Wright.\nOpening with You Show No\nEmotion At All, they began to show\ntheir proficiency in the live field.\nAgainst a backdrop of projected\nautumn sunsets in public parks (I\nfound this quite nostalgic) they created a warm atmosphere of guitars\nand keyboards brushed with skittering beats and white noise, the bass\nundulating like the hills in the film\nreel. It was compelling to watch, and\nmore so to listen. However, three\nsongs in and disaster struck \u2013 an\nonstage power cut! I\u2019ve never seen\none of those before. So for the next\ntwo songs the PA was a bit sketchy\nwith a loss of vocals at one point, and\nalso the drummer\u2019s headphones fal-tering, knocking him out of time. It\nmust have been really gutting for\nthe band and we were certainly disappointed as it really affected their\nperformance.\nHood persevered like professionals and continued to play tortured,\nbeautiful creations. The system\nreturned to normal and Hood played\nout the rest of their set. Anyone who\nknows Hood will tell you that it\u2019s\nvery hard to successfully describe\ntheir music. The vocals drift like\nghosts in and out of the intricate network of notes and electronic beats,\nsupplemented by live drums and\nkeyboards. The resulting sound is\nbeautiful and melancholy, tragic and\ninspiring, heart warming and spine\nchilling. I know this appears to be\nhyperbole but they were very very\ngood, and only massive technical\nfailures held them back from a near\nperfect performance. Monkeez\nLast Wednesday night I lost my\nLondon-afflicted musical purity\nand descended deep into the dungeons that is The Play Room, at\nChez Stelios (10 Paddington St\nMarylebone, Tube: Baker Street).\nMy friend suggested that I come and\nhang out while he played in the band\nfor Nicholece K Garner, the star\nact that night, supported by 3-piece\nShrugged.\nThe wave of nostalgia hit me the\nmoment I entered the room. I\u2019ve\npreviously been avoiding London\u2019s\nlocal music scene for two reasons\n\u2013 I thought that for my first year\nat least I should hang out with my\nclassmates and attempt to concentrate on my course. Also, I left my\ndear music-loving friends back in\nhometown Melbourne, and had a\nmighty hard time convincing the\nclassical music geeks in London\nthat the alternative stuff is cool.\nNa\u00efve as I was, I\u2019ve wasted a lot of\nvaluable time not enjoying London\u2019s\nunderground music scene.\nThe Play Room transported me\nback to my days in Melbourne,\nwhich is a city littered with invisible\ntreasures \u2013 funky hideaway bars\nand jazz clubs that crawl with life\nat night. The cozy dark room with\nlow ceilings, pretty lights and lots\nof candles was buzzing with people\nthat you don\u2019t see on the streets of\nLondon during the daytime hours\n\u2013 the all-natural part hippie tren-dies, or \u201cSt Kilda crowd\u201d as we\nwould say at home. The atmosphere\nwas friendly and relaxed, and nearly\neveryone seemed to be mates with\nsomeone on stage.\nNicholece K Garner \u2013 also a\nMelbourne girl \u2013 brought her whole-some, vibrant style to the heart of\nLondon. With a clear high voice that\nwas not at all whiney (see: Kasey\nChambers), husky at times but very\nbold and direct, Nicholece\u2019s singing\nwas energetic and captivating. The\ngroup worked very well together as\na whole, the musicians getting on\nwith what they were doing without\na fuss. The songs had varied themes\nof nature, loneliness, \u2018naughty\u2019\ngirls... the usual innocent stuff \u2013 my\nfavourite being The Stop And Go\nMan about a relation of Nicholece\u2019s\naspiring to be the man with the stop\nand go sign on a country road in\noutback Australia.\nThere were bits of funk, blues and\neven reggae in the set, at times\nsounding a lot like the John Butler\nTrio (especially when singing about\nJabbaluka, a controversial uranium\nmine in the Northern Territory). She\nwhetted our appetite with interesting introductions to each number,\nand added to the relaxed nature\nof the whole thing with her chirpy,\nuninhibited style. Nicholece and\nco. were musical and entertaining\n\u2013 it was fresh, a little different, and\nthe sort of unoffensive music that\nalmost anyone would be content to\nlisten to.\nOf course, going to see unsigned\nbands can be dangerous business\n\u2013 it\u2019s venturing into the unknown\nwhere lies the occasional treasure,\nbut there\u2019s certainly a lot of strange\nwaters to wade though. Shrugged\nwereaninterestingbunch\u2013Ithought\nat one point Matchbox 20, at another Coldplay, and constantly about\nhow the singer would benefit from\na lesson or two. Don\u2019t get me wrong\n\u2013 they could make a pretty good\nnoise, and the musical ideas were\nsound \u2013 with some lovely melodically sensuous chord progressions\nto prick up the ear. Unfortunately for\nthem, the singer was, only a little,\nbut pretty consistently below pitch,\nwhich may not annoy most people,\nbut my musical ear betrays me yet\nagain. Having said that, Jack White\nmanages to miss four or five pitches\nbut somehow it\u2019s still OK, so maybe\nhe\u2019s onto something...\nThere was certainly a lot of acting\ngoing on on stage \u2013 the frontman\nswinging from side to side with his\neyes closed was not too unusual, but\nthe bassist curiously managed to\nplay the instrument with his elbow\nbent (possibly in some strange show\nof pained emotion) back so that he\nlooked rather like a chicken. They\nhad very lyrical melodic lines, and\nambiguous chord points that were\nvery attractive. The lyrics were not\nvery memorable, but all in all, a\ndecent show.\nIt was certainly an interesting,\nentertaining night out, and I have a\nfeeling that I got good value for my\nmoney (all four pounds of it). It\u2019s\ntempting to indulge in taking a risk\nevery forthcoming Wednesday \u2013 and\ngoing to The Play Room to be enter-tained. The venue itself is so snug\nand comfy \u2013 it\u2019s an appealing place\nto de-stress midweek whilst enjoying some new and unusual music,\nand it\u2019s a great way to keep in touch\nwith some of the goings-on in alternative music... I\u2019ve finally realised\nthat it makes you look pretty cool\nwhen you can talk to musicians and\nmusic-lovers about bands no one\u2019s\nheard of.

The Great Hall was\nunrecognisable, decked out with\na huge stage, speaker stacks that\nlooked like Stonehenge, and a bar\nof similar proportions. Another bar\nhad appeared in the Ante Room,\ncatering for thirsty punters enjoying\nmore live entertainment in the Main\nDining Hall.\nThe famous Big Band kicked off\nthe proceedings, beginning their\nfourth gig in four days. It didn\u2019t\nshow. In fact, this reviewer had seen\nall three of their preceding shows,\nand, if anything, they were getting\nbetter. After a blistering first set,\nthey began running up a healthy bar\ntab, handing the torch over to rock\nband Cartel to get underway in the\nGreat Hall.\nAll the way from Stoke-on-Trent\n(someone\u2019s got to be), Cartel\u2019s\nunique brand of melody-driven\npunk-rock, interspersed with\ncomedy banter and shameless plugging of CDs, went down a storm.\nThe crowd bounced their way\nthrough a 45-minute set encompassing plenty of the band\u2019s own catalogue and even an unlikely Franz\nFerdinand cover. You can catch\nCartel at this Friday\u2019s Rock City\nevent at the Union \u2013 I\u2019ll be down the\nfront, spilling my beer.\nMeanwhile in the MDH, the Big\nBand were launching into their second set. Packed with classics, their\nshow ended with the whole room on\nits feet, dancing in the aisles. Huge\nthanks go to the whole band for\ndelivering the goods once again. You\ncan see them for the last time before\nEaster on Thursday 17 March in\ndB\u2019s, and I suggest you do, if only for\ntheir unfailingly entertaining range\nof hats.\nEveryone then seemed to pile\nen masse into the Great Hall for\nsome up-beat tunes from DJ Mark\nRivkin, followed by the final band of\nthe evening, the gloriously monik-ered Our Souls. Their set was a\nhigh-velocity trip round almost\nevery genre of popular music imagi-nable, all delivered in a foot-shuf-flingly funky style. The crowd was\nshaking its thing and the drinks\nwere flowing.\nThe night culminated in a\ntrademark set from Fabric resident DJ MacPherson, before the\naudience dispersed and the lights\nwent down.\nIn all, the evening raised several\nthousand pounds, which is to be\nsplit between Oxfam and Action Aid\nfor redevelopment in the areas hit\nby the tsunami. The money will be\nused, amongst other things, to provide local people with tools, mate-rials, shelter and wages as they\nrebuild their communities and get\nthemselves back on their feet. It\nwas all made possible through the\nsupport of production companies\nOrbital Sound and Sound2Light,\nthe generosity of the bands and\nDJs, the bars and the caterers, and\nthrough the unfailing enthusiasm,\ncommitment and expertise of the\nevent\u2019s organisers, Richard Jordan,\nMark Rivkin and Kylie Daniels.\nOrganising an event on this scale is\nchallenging enough, but to do it for\nzero cost, so that every penny of\nticket sales goes to charity, is a fantastic achievement.\nBut no money would have been\nraised without those of you who\npaid your tenner and came along\non the night. You\u2019ve really made a\ndifference, and shared Imperial\u2019s\nbest night of entertainment this\nyear. So thank you. But you don\u2019t\nhave to stop there. Real change to\nhelp the world\u2019s poor will come only\nfrom sustained effort. So do your bit\ntoday, and let\u2019s not wait for the next\ntsunami.\nFEATURE felix@ic.ac.uk\nClockwise from top left: Cartel, Our Souls, the Jazz Big Band, and Our Souls again\n\n"

Apart from being\n\u2018that place where we have\nexams and go to the JCR\u2019,\nit also boasts the Blyth Art\nGallery on its fifth floor. This\nis the annual setting for\nPhotosoc\u2019s exhibition, displaying the best work from\nour members.\nThis year the committee\ndesignated the (optional)\ntheme to be \u2018Exploring Time\u2019.\nThe theme was deliberately made to be quite vague,\nin order to give members\nfreedom to interpret it. As a\nresult, our exhibition has a\nreal mix of photos, some quite\nwacky shots as well as more\nconventional prints.\nHalf of the photos are\nframed, with the rest being\nmounted directly on foam\nboard to give an experimental\nfeel to a section of our exhibi-tion. The photos are roughly\nsplit between digital and film\nprints, both black and white\nand colour. Digital prints are\ncertainly more of a feature in\nthis exhibition compared to\nprevious years. For the first\ntime, we are also exhibiting a\nset of camera phone photos,\nby Gus Sepp.\nAsinpreviousyears,awards\nwere given for the best photos\nat the opening evening (last\nThursday). Rather than the\ncommittee judging, the task\nwas given to Richard Dickins,\ndirector of music at Imperial,\nand Mindy Lee, the College\u2019s\narts animateur, both of whom\nhelped organise the exhibition along with the Photosoc\ncommittee and members.\nThe overall winner was\nKristina Buch, with runners-up in colour (Sarah Shemilt)\nand black and white (Pavlos\nPapaefstathiou).Alsonewthis\nyear was the audience vote,\nwon by Fenella Beynon. The\nvote was conducted using a\nstate of the art ballot box, specially cobbled together from\nspare bits in the dark room,\njust in time for the opening\nevening.\nAlso exhibiting alongside\nPhotosoc are some jewellery\nsculptures which look impossible to create. If you have got\nany spare time, make sure\nyou visit the gallery before 20\nMarch when the exhibition\nends to see our award winning work!\nIf exhibiting in a real art gallery sounds good to you, join\nPhotosoc and you\u2019ll be able\nto take part in next year\u2019s\nexhibition. Photosoc holds\nmeetings every Thursday at\n1pm in dBs and events (some\nsubsidised) throughout the\nterm, ranging from photo\nshooting trips to studio sessions to darkroom tutorials.\nIt\u2019s great to see that we have\nso many photographers at\nImperial.

    "content": "SINGLE REVIEWS\nThe Subways are a hotly tipped trio\nfrom that most rocking of places\u2026\ner, Welwyn Garden City. Somehow,\neven with their rather suburban\nsurroundings, they have managed\nto craft a fantastically filthy and\nraw brand of garage rock. This is\ntheir first single off of their debut\nalbum but don\u2019t let that fool you,\nthey are seasoned professionals\nhaving already played Glastonbury\nas well as the Reading and Leeds\nfestivals. The single is a ball of musical energy, played fast and hard it\ndoesn\u2019t get the chance to outstay\nits welcome clocking in at only 2:58.\nIt\u2019s very reminiscent of The Von\nBondies at their rollicking best and\npaints a bright future for this young\nband. Dom Wong\nAfter the huge successes of\ntheir two most recent albums, Get\nReady in 2001 and Retro in 2002,\nManchester\u2019s arguably most influential band return with the first single from their eighth studio album\nWaiting for the Sirens\u2019 Call. Krafty\nis a far cry from the band\u2019s club-orientated earlier albums, applying\nsynthesisers and electronic drums\nas embellishments rather than foun-dations. The song has all the ingredients of a great New Order track\n\u2013 emotive electronica, timeless\nvocals, and Peter Hook\u2019s inimitably\ngnarly bass. The chorus is anticli-mactically drab after the potential\nyou can sense in the build up, the\nsong in general lacking the dynamics and strength one would expect\nfrom a grand return single. The\nband themselves consider this to be\none of their finest ever tracks, but,\nwhile undeniably being a good song,\nit feels more of a mid-album filler\ntrack given New Order\u2019s history.\nBen Ramadan\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBrit Awards 25\nThe Brits this year were unusual as guitar bands\u2019 impact on the charts crossed over to the\nawards ceremony. Felix tried to get into the red carpet area and spent the night outside\n23\nLIVE REVIEWS\nIf you didn\u2019t already know, the 25th\nBrit Awards were held two weeks\nago at Earls Court, London. I decided to try my luck and get some\ninterviews for both readers of Felix\nand listeners of IC Radio.\nI turned up outside Earls Court 2\nearly in the afternoon and found out\nthat the security at this event was\nvery tight. I was hoping to get into\nthe TV/Radio Press Area so I could\ntalk to the stars as they arrived but\nthe one thing I needed to achieve\nthis was a Red Carpet Pass. After\nabout half an hour of trying to convince the staff that I was meant to\nhave one, I was escorted off the\npremises. Things were not looking\ngood.\nEventually I managed to sneak\nback in and convinced one security\nguard to let me into the paparazzi\narea, so I could at least see all\nthe arrivals. Soon afterwards some\nmembers of Stoic arrived and they\njoined me.\nFirst to arrive were Franz\nFerdinand \u2013 the Scottish band with\nthe most nominations of the night.\nSoon afterwards the Scissor Sisters\narrived, then Lemar and Jamelia\ncame together. They kept on coming - Keane, Daniel & Natasha\nBedingfield, McFly, Aleesha ex-Misteeq, Robbie Williams sporting\na newly shaven head, Green Day,\nJordan, Steve Brookstein from XFactor, Joss Stone, Simon from\nBlue, Minnie Driver, Sharon &\nKelly Osbourne, Will Young, Dannii\nMinogue, Rooster, Gwen Stefani\u2026.\nThe list goes on.\nUnfortunately from my position\nI couldn\u2019t get any interviews but I\nnearly talked to Snoop Dogg and\nPharrell who came over. I asked\nPharrell how he was doing and he\njust nodded at me, which doesn\u2019t\nreally work for radio. Anyway, the\nstars came and went and we decided to retire to a pub because it was\nfreezing outside.\nThe Scissor Sisters opened the\nnight with a great performance of\nTake Your Mama Out alongside\nJim Henson singing watermel-ons, barns and giant birds. They\nwere the big winners of the night\nscooping all three awards they\nwere nominated for \u2013 International\nBreakthrough Act, International\nGroup and International Album.\nFranz Ferdinand, Keane and\nJoss Stone all walked away with\ntwo awards each, Robbie Williams\nwas presented with the Best Song\nFrom The Past 25 Years by Little\nBritain\u2019s Matt Lucas and David\nWalliams (who dressed up as ex-Take That members Gary Barlow\nand Howard Donald), while Sir Bob\nGeldof received an Outstanding\nContribution To Music award.\nThe Brits are known for their\ngreat duets \u2013 past examples have\nincluded Kylie & Justin Timberlake,\nRobbie Williams & Tom Jones \u2013\nand this year was no exception.\nDaniel and Natasha Bedingfield did\ntheir first ever duet singing Chaka\nKhan\u2019s Ain\u2019t Nobody, Lemar and\nJamelia did a very hot performance of Addicted To Love and there\nwas a surprise duet on the night\nbetween Robbie Williams and Joss\nStone with Angels.\nUndeterred I went back to Earls\nCourt 2 after the awards, not knowing anything about what had happened at the ceremony, hoping to\ncatch some of the stars as they\nmake their way to the aftershow\nparty which was also held at Earls\nCourt. Surprisingly the first person to the leave the event was\nJordan. She said the highlight of the\nevening was the food but she also\nsaid, \u201cThere were good perform-ances. I liked Daniel Bedingfield\nand Natasha they were very good\nand Robbie Williams and Joss. Very\ngood.\u201d\nGirls Aloud left not too long after-wards. Cheryl was a bit disappointed to lose out to McFly in the Best\nPop Act but Nadine enjoyed the\nevening: \u201cIt was very very good. The\nhighlight was Jamelia and Lemar\nfor me,\u201d whereas Sarah preferred\nSnoop Dogg and Pharrell\u2019s performance of Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\nas did Amy Winehouse: \u201cSnoop and\nPharrell made my fucking night,\nactually they made my week.\u201d When\nasked how the night went Amy\nreplied, \u201cMy night starts now. They\ndidn\u2019t even have any Jack Daniels in\nthere\u2026 Me saying that I look really\npissed \u2013 I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve been drinking\nwater because I\u2019d rather stay sober\non a shitty night than drink shitty\nalcohol and get depressed.\u201d\nI saw other celebs walk by that\nI couldn\u2019t coax over to talk to me.\nThey included Simon from Blue, who\nwas on the phone and just waved,\nand Tom from McFly, who looked\nover when I called his name out\nand then proceeded to walk straight\ninto a bollard. Unfortunately Stoic\ndidn\u2019t capture that on film \u2013 they\nleft shortly afterwards whereas I\npersisted and got to talk to a few\nmore people.\nFame Academy headmaster\nRichard Park thought it was \u201cabsolutely marvellous, sensational per-formances. I love Franz Ferdinand\nso I thought they were fantastic but\nthere was any amount of highlights:\nJoss Stone singing with Robbie\nWilliams that was awesome, Green\nDay just brilliant. This was one of\nthe best Brits I\u2019ve ever been to and\nI\u2019ve been to them all for twenty\nyears. The feeling when Geldof sang\nI Don\u2019t Like Mondays was also mar-vellous. Great night.\u201d Fellow reality\nTV judge, Nicky Chapman from Pop\nIdol \u201chad a great night\u201d and loved\nRobbie and Joss\u2019 performance.\nI just managed to spot Capital\nDJ Foxy leaving not from the red\ncarpet and rushed over to him, then\nspotting he was with fellow presenter Katy Hill. Foxy was very friendly\n\u201cHello there. It was very good \u2013 a\nvery good show, Chris Evans was\nvery good, Gwen Stefani was very\ngood, the Scissor Sisters were a\nbrilliant opening, don\u2019t you think,\nMiss Katy Hill?\u201d and she replied,\n\u201cBrilliant opening, absolutely fan-tastic. You were quite excited with\nBob Geldof.\u201d Foxy thought he was\n\u201cfantastic\u201d and the award was \u201clong\noverdue.\u201d When asked about the\natmosphere backstage Foxy told\nme, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it 16 years\nnow so I suppose it was very organ-ised. But it\u2019s always fun, a good\natmosphere. I managed to do my\nshow before and do some backstage\nstuff and then come out and then I\nwatched the show. It\u2019ll be the best\nTV show they\u2019ve ever done by a\nlong way \u2013 it\u2019s a made for TV award\nshow.\u201d Katy Hill was disappointed\nthat Natasha Bedingfield didn\u2019t win\nanything - \u201cI think she\u2019s amazing\u201d\n- but when asked about the duet\nshe explained, \u201cI thought the choice\nof song was a bit bizarre seeing as\nthey\u2019re brother and sister \u2013 it was a\nlittle bit lovey-dovey and a bit sexy. I\nthink they could have chosen a better song but they\u2019re both amazing\nsingers,\u201d and Foxy agreed, \u201cThey\u2019re\nclass those two. Joss Stone was also\nclass. I think it\u2019s interesting because\na lot of people chat, there\u2019s lots of\npeople you know so it ends up being\nquite a chatty night and there\u2019s lots\nof booze going so everyone\u2019s getting\nhammered and people lose concen-tration.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\nSPORT sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\n33\nBy Gemma Dor\u00e9\nWell the Riding Club A Team\nhad an interesting season\nthis year. We only had three\ncompetitions, as Kingston\nhad dropped out of the league\nbefore Christmas. We were\ncompeting at our new yard at\nTrent for the first time, so the\nextra training sessions really\ncame in handy.\nOur first competition of the\nseason was at Brunel \u2013 not\nour favourite venue, I have\nto say \u2013 we always seem to\ndo badly there and this year\nwas to prove no exception. I\nwoke up on the Monday with\nan awful cold, and by the time\nevening came I found myself\non the phone to captain Jo\nhaving serious doubts that I\u2019d\nbe able to ride. She convinced\nme to come along anyway,\nand so I arrived at Snowball\nFarm wishing I was in bed!\nThe rest of the team were\nfit and healthy, and Tess was\nexcited to be at her first ever\nBUSA comp. This soon wore\noff however, as you realise\nthat a large part of doing well\nin BUSA, as with all aspects\nof equestrianism, involves\nhaving luck on your side and\nwhat kind of mood your horse\nis in \u2013 and it really can go both\nways.\nThe dressage was a bit of a\nshambles really. You need to\nbe within about 5% of the leading test to be in with a chance,\nand a red-faced Tess (who\nspent the whole warm-up\nwishing that she was allowed\nspurs on her deceptively lazy\nhorse, who seemed immune\nto the whip) got off to a really\ngood start being less than 3%\nbehind the leader. Zo\u00eb and I\nwere just about on the case,\nboth being 5% behind, and Jo\nhad felt the brunt of BUSA\nbad luck, by being the last to\ngo on her horse, which was\nabsolutely knackered by this\npoint, and could barely maintain a good canter.\nNot surprisingly, we went\ninto the jumping in last place,\nand \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 the jumping was merely a formality, as\nthe track was tiny, with the\nonly \u2018problem\u2019 being a tight\nturn into the last fence which\nwas a style. This meant that\nit had no real bearing on the\nresults, and last is where we\nstayed. Tess did brilliantly to\npick up fifth in her first comp,\nand Zo\u00eb beat me to eighth\nby one point. The highlight\nof the day for me was the\nworried manner with which\nthe other teams enquired\nif we still rode at Medburn,\nand if we did, would we be\nusing Winston (anyone who\nrides that horse is scarred\nfor life)!\nNext up was UCL. Again,\nthe dressage was awful. I\nthought I\u2019d done really well\non Cashmere, possibly the\nidlest pony I\u2019d ever ridden.\nHe went quite well, and did\na nice test, with a fairly consistent head carriage. I really\ndidn\u2019t expect to be so far off\nthe pace \u2013 over 10% behind,\nthough the lead scores were\nsome of the highest I\u2019ve ever\nseen at BUSA. In my defence,\nI was still relying heavily on\nNurofen to get me through\nthe day and I was first on, and\nthe Judge is usually always\nover- or under-generous with\nthe 1st rider (I claim under!)\nTess rode the huge Bertie\nexcellently to take the leading\ntest with him. Jo did a great\njob on Frank, and Zo\u00eb \u2013 who\nis more used to taking her\nmum\u2019s Thoroughbred eventing \u2013 is, by her own admis-sion, not a cob rider, so I\u2019ll say\nno more about that! Again,\nthe jumping had very little\ninfluence on the dressage,\nbut we got two riders placed\nagain \u2013 Tess joint third and Jo\njoint eighth.\nAnd now, the home comp.\nWell it was interesting! I had\nonly ridden my dressage\nhorse, Malibu, three times, (I\nrode my old dressage horse,\nthe phenomenal Winston, at\nleast about 100 times) and\nZo\u00eb had only ridden Gus for\nabout 20 minutes (though he\nis very similar in character to\nZo\u00eb\u2019s favourite horse, Basil).\nThere were no worries about\nTess and Jo though \u2013 they\nknew their horses inside\nout.\nThe dressage was the best\nyet; we ended on a score of\nsix, with both Jo and Zo\u00eb\nabsolutely blowing away the\ncompetition on Storm (who\nis not an easy ride) and Gus,\nwho developed brain strain\n(though after Zo\u00eb got off, as\nshe was lucky enough to get\nhim first) when the second\ngirl bullied him a bit, and he\ntherefore decided to have a\ntantrum in the middle of their\ntest. There is no consoling\nGus after he\u2019s been upset, his\nlittle thoroughbred brain can\u2019t\nhandle it, so the third rider\nalso had a dreadful time! Tess\nwas ever so disappointed with\nher six mark discrepancy.\nThe Brunel girl had ridden\nMerlin before, at a friendly\ncomp we held for C team riders last year (what their best\nfirst team riders were doing\nthere I\u2019ll never know, hardly\nfair on the other universities\nwho did send C team riders),\nand knew exactly what buttons to press. I had Malibu\nfirst (bad luck of the draw)\nand she was like a rocket,\nbut had calmed down by the\ntime her subsequent riders\ngot on. The girl who won on\nher made two mistakes that\nthe judge didn\u2019t seem to pick\nup (grrrr), and the less said\nabout the whole thing the bet-ter, as far as Tess and I were\nconcerned!\nThe jumping was slightly\nmore eventful than previous comps, but not much as\nTrent had lowered our course\nafter the previous week\u2019s B\nteam comp. Trio, Flash, BJ\nand Pablo all jumped really\nwell, though when I warmed\nTrio (Tess\u2019 jump horse) up,\nhe was squealing, bucking\nand bronco-ing like a rodeo\npony, and progressively got\nfaster and faster for the other\nteams. Tess did a brilliant\nround on him though, especially since she had him last,\nand he really was a like a\nsteam train by this point. Jo\njumped a brilliant clear on\nFlash (with Zo\u00eb and I just\nhaving one pole) to secure\nfirst, with Zo\u00eb in third, Tess\nin fifth and me in seventh.\nWe got team first place, and\nto cap it all off, Jo and Tess\nmade it through to the region-als as the two highest scoring\nindividuals, so big congratulations for them!\nIf there are any people\nreading this who fancy a go\nat competing, then please\nget in touch, as we are losing four team riders this year\nand would love to hear from\nanyone who is happy doing\na Novice level dressage test\nand jumping a strange (some-times in the worst sense)\nhorse around a 3ft course.\nYou can find all the info you\nneed on our website: www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/riding.\nRIDING\nGoing for a ride\nZo\u00eb and Dutch at Brunel\nJo on winning form with Storm\nTess jumping Mouse\nThe A team, desperate to get down to the pub\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nIn October 2006, the first home and\nEU undergraduate students paying\n\u00a33,000 a year \u2018top-up\u2019 fees will arrive\nat Imperial College. Whilst they will\nnot pay the fees until after they grad-uate, the College will receive the\nmoney up front, through the Student\nLoans Company. Consequently,\nthere will be a fair amount of extra\nincome coming into Imperial, estimated at around \u00a311m per year\n(once all undergraduates are paying\nthe higher fees).\nWhere will the extra \u00a311m be\nspent? Well, just over \u00a33m will\nbe spent on financing a bursary\nscheme, approved by the Office of\nFair Access. This will be used to\nprovide bursaries of between \u00a3300\nand \u00a34000 to supplement the maintenance grants and loans received\nby students from the poorest back-grounds. That still leaves the other\n\u00a38m \u2013 which the College still needs\nto work out how to spend.\nA substantial proportion of it\nshould go directly into teaching.\nBut how exactly should a few extra\nmillion pounds a year be used to\nimprove teaching quality? There are\na huge number of possibilities. It\ncould be spent on facilities such as\nlabs or libraries. Maybe there could\nbe more use of (expensive) practical\nteaching rather than theory-based\nteaching (lectures) where that is\nappropriate.\nExtra money could also be allocated to staff pay. This could be\nbeneficial to students and teaching quality in a number of ways.\nFor example, by offering higher\nsalaries, the College could attract\nbetter lecturers. Staff/student\nratios could be improved, leading to smaller classes. Have you\nbeen affected by a brilliant lecturer\nbeing made redundant because they\ndo not bring in enough research\nincome? Having extra money to\nemploy teaching staff could allow for\nsuch teaching experts to be hired or\nretained.\nPerhaps you think that teaching\nitself is OK but that money needs\nto be invested in supporting skills\ndevelopment. Would you like the\nCollege to spend more money on\nthings like \u2018soft skills\u2019 training and\nhelp with job hunting?\nThese are all the sorts of questions\nwe need to be asking. Higher tuition\nfees improve the status of students\nas \u2018customers\u2019 of the College. If we\nare going to be paying the College\na significant amount of extra money\nthen we should be in a strong position to influence how that money is\nspent.\nHow to spend money on improving\nteaching quality is something that\nthe Union as well as the College as a\nwhole need discuss in a positive and\nconstructive manner. I welcome all\ncomments from students and look\nforward to the debate.\nHow should teaching be topped up?\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nThe house-hunting checklist\nIt\u2019s getting to that time when students are starting to think about\nwhere they\u2019re going to live next\nyear. Perhaps you have to move\nout of halls, or perhaps you would\nlike to move somewhere for another\nreason.\nWhen trying to find a place to rent,\nit can be a stressful time, not only\ntrying to find somewhere but also\nkeeping your potential housemates\nhappy, as many people have different standards in what they are\nlooking for.\nIt\u2019s important to read any contract\nyou are given thoroughly before signing it, as in some cases it could contain unfair terms. The Information\nand Advice Centre Offers a tenancy\nagreement checking service which\nis free to use. We will be able to\nadvise you if the terms within the\ncontract are unfair or not.\nBelow is a checklist of things to\nlook out for when having a look\nround a property. I hope that it will\nbe helpful for you. Also, as this is the\nlast issue before Easter, I\u2019d just like\nto say happy holidays!\nExternal features\nA visual inspection of the exterior of\nthe property is always useful. Look\nfor the following:\n\u25cf Slipped or broken tiles\n\u25cf Rotten timber (especially window\nframes and doors)\n\u25cf Broken guttering\n\u25cf Crumbling or cracked walls\n\u25cf Adequate storage for rubbish\n\u25cf Whether the property has a yard\nor garden \u2013 if so, ask who will be\nresponsible for its maintenance.\nInternal features\nThere are a number of questions\nthat you need to ask either yourself\nor the landlord/agent when visiting\na property. These include:\n\u25cf How many rooms are there in the\nproperty?\n\u25cf How many are communal rooms?\n\u25cf Are enough facilities being provided for the number of people who\nwill be sharing the house?\n\u25cf Is the furniture in a good state?\n\u25cf How is the property heated?\n\u25cf Do the fridge, cooker etc work\nproperly?\n\u25cf Is there plenty of hot water?\n\u25cf Is the house free of damp and/or\nmould?\nSafety and security features\nIn addition to checking for yourself\nthat the contents that are provided\nare sufficient and in working order,\nit is vital that you ask questions to\nthe landlord/agent about the safety\nand security of the property. If in\ndoubt, talk to the Information and\nAdvice Service. The following questions are essential:\n\u25cf Does the landlord possess a current gas safety certificate?\n\u25cf Can the landlord prove that a\nCORGI registered engineer carried\nout the inspection?\n\u25cf Have you checked to see that all\ngas appliances within the property\nhave been included, and passed as\nbeing safe, on the gas safety cer-tificate?\n\u25cf Did the inspection take place\nwithin the last 12 months?\n\u25cf Is there any fire detection equipment (eg smoke alarms) and does\nit work?\n\u25cf If there was a fire, would you\nbe able to escape using the main\nexits?\n\u25cf Has the electrical wiring been\nchecked within the last five years?\n\u25cf Are all plug sockets free from\ncracks or other damage?\n\u25cf Are there sufficient plug sockets\nin each room?\n\u25cf Does all furniture comply with the\nrelevant regulations?\n\u25cf Are there locks on the windows?\n\u25cf Have the previous tenants all\nreturned their keys?\nLocation of the property\nAs well as looking at the property\nitself, we recommend that you also\nconsider where the property is situated and ask yourself the following\nquestions:\n\u25cf Is the area convenient for your\nstudies?\n\u25cf How close are you to public trans-port?\n\u25cf Are local shops and facilities ade-quate?\n\u25cf Would you feel safe walking in the\narea at night?\nIf you have any housing enquiries at\nall, or would like to discuss this article further, contact the Information\nand Advice Centre on advice@ic.\nac.uk or 020 7594 8067.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nThe joy of... Faculty Unions\nImperial College Union is renowned\nthe world over for having a slightly\nbizarre and rather complex struc-ture. The layer that bewilders most\npeople is our system of Faculty\nUnions. Originally developing from\na collection of social clubs based in\neach Constituent College (prior to\nthe recent restructuring of Imperial\ninto Faculties), the Faculty Unions\noffer our students another layer of\npossible involvement in College life.\nWhat do they do, though? They\nco-ordinate academic representation in their respective Faculties\n(using a network of representatives\nelected by each course, year-group,\nresearch group, etc); organise central activities (such as RAG Week\nevents, bar nights, freshers\u2019 balls);\noversee the Buddies Schemes which\nintroduce freshers into the wonders\nthat Imperial College has to offer\nand look after other aspects of student welfare; and serve a variety of\nclubs and departmental societies,\noffering them a link to the Union,\nas well as keeping track of their\nfinances.\n\u201cWow!\u201dIhearyouexclaim.\u201cInever\nknew they did so much! How do I get\ninvolved?\u201d Well, the City & Guilds\nCollege Union (representing all students in the Faculty of Engineering),\ntheFacultyofLifeSciencesStudents\u2019\nUnion and the Faculty of Physical\nSciences Students\u2019 Union (known as\nLifeSci and PhysSci to their friends)\nare currently in the middle of election fever. Whilst nominations are\nclosed for most positions, it\u2019s not\ntoo late to take an active interest in\nthe elections, read the candidates\u2019\nmanifestos, and vote for those who\nyou think will represent you the\nbest. In addition, Faculty Unions are\nalways crying out for more support\nfrom volunteers. Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine Students\u2019 Union\n(ICSMSU) is holding its elections\nnext term, so look out for more info\non this. For more information on\nall elections, please see www.union.\nic.ac.uk/elections.\nThat \u2018OLE Survey\nOn-Line Evaluations (or OLEs, as\nthey are more affectionately known)\nseem to be all the rave at the\nmoment.

    "content": "From the director of the hugely\nsuccessful Gladiator comes this\nyear\u2019s early summer blockbuster\n\u2013 an epic of gigantic proportions\nnamed Kingdom of Heaven. It is of\nreassurance that Ridley Scott \u2013 the\nmaster of modern epics \u2013 will be\ndirecting this. Scott has claimed\nhimself that this production will be\n\u201ceven grander than Gladiator.\u201d The\nfilm boasts a strong cast, featuring\nOrlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, Eva\nGreen, Jeremy Irons, David Thewlis\nand Brendan Gleeson, to name but\na few.\nSet in 12th century Europe and\nthe Middle East, this movie epic\ntells the story of a young peasant\n(Orlando Bloom) thrust into a long\nwar. Serving a doomed king and\neventually rising up to knighthood,\nhe finds himself faced with the\ndaunting task of protecting the people of Jerusalem against external\nthreats whilst trying to keep peace\nacross the land. All this while falling in love with an exotic princess\n(Green). In short and from the trail-er, it looks like the product of three\nepic films \u2013 Gladiator, Alexander\nand A Knight\u2019s Tale \u2013 thrown togeth-er. However, given the current situation in the world today, it will be\ninteresting to see how Scott has\ndealt with the sensitive issue of the\nCrusades whilst still being historically accurate.\nJudging by the trailers, the film\nseems to follow Scott\u2019s previous\nwork \u2013 Kingdom of Heaven certainly does look like a visually grand\nmasterpiece. The trailer shows dramatic landscape shots of amassing\narmies and powerful battle scenes\ninterspersed with lines of poignant\ndialogue. The soundtrack accompanying the trailer gives the musically\ninclined amongst us something to\nlook forward to: Harry GregsonWilliams has produced a very atmospheric and moving score not dissimilar to the soundtrack accompanying\nGladiator. Why exactly Scott did not\nkeep Hans Zimmer, the composer\nof Gladiator\u2019s soundtrack, on this\nproject is still unclear. It is interesting to note that although Scott\ndecided to replace Zimmer with\nGregson-Williams, the exact opposite occurred for the scoring duties\nof Madagascar.\nThe acting talent seems promis-ing. Liam Neeson looks particularly\nfitting as Godfrey of Ibelin, and Eva\nGreen does a commendable job of\nlooking like the hauntingly beautiful\nyet vulnerable and forbidden prin-cess. Orlando Bloom \u2013 the protagonist of the film \u2013 is the only one I still\nhave issues with, however. True, he\ndoes manage to look convincingly\nrugged in some of the shots as the\nyoung valiant knight. Still, though,\nhe delivers his lines with a stilted\nforcedness that makes me cringe. I\nthink giving awe-inspiring pre-battle\nspeeches is just not his thing. Let\u2019s\nhope he doesn\u2019t throw us another\nwooden performance reminiscent of\nthose he gave us in Pirates of the\nCaribbean and Troy \u2013 maybe then\nKingdom of Heaven might just live\nup to its hype. Marya Ziauddin\n20th Century Fox presents\nFelix previews the next two big releases from 20th Century Fox\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\n26\nKingdom of Heaven\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nStarring: Orlando Bloom, Eva Green,\nJeremy Irons, Liam Neeson,\nEdward Norton, David Thewlis\nReleased: May 6\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHas Orlando Bloom been in a movie that wasn\u2019t set in the past?\nRepair for adventure!\nThe Academy Award winning director of the worldwide smash hit Ice\nAge, Chris Wedge, brings you this\nground-breaking, spectacular, three-dimensional world, taking animation\nto a new level.\nIt\u2019s set in a world full of mechanical walking talking robots! To make\nthings better, about five Oscar winners have been brought in to voice\nthe robots, each with their own\ndistinctive personality. Characters\ninclude the idealistic robot Rodney\nCopperbottom (Ewan McGregor)\nwho tries to convince his electronic\nmates to come together and make\nthe world better; a beautiful executive Cappy (Halle Berry); the despicable corporate tormenter Ratchet\n(Greg Kinnear); a master inventor Bigweld (Mel Brooks) who has\nlost his way; and a group of misfits known as the Rusties led by\nFender (Robin Williams) and Piper\nPinwheeler (Amanda Bynes).\nFender\u2019s head, arms and legs routinely fall off at the most inconvenient moments and as Rodney fulfills\nFender\u2019s ongoing need for repairs,\nthe two become great friends. Piper\nis Fender\u2019s tomboy sister, who surprises everyone with her determination and strength.\nThe story continues with Rodney\nhaving two main dreams. One is to\nmake the world a better place and\nthe other is to meet his most adored\nidol, Bigweld. On his way, he meets\nCappy who catches his interest.\nDespite his good intentions, Rodney\nends up facing opposition from an\nevil corporation lead by Big Weld\nand finds some unlikely allies in the\nform of a ragtag group, the misfit\nrobots, as he tries to make robots\ncapable of making the world a better place.\nOn first impression, Robots doesn\u2019t\ncome over too well. It is supposed to\nbe a comedic tale but somehow it\ndoesn\u2019t go in that direction. Yes, it is\nfrom the director of the well known\nhilarious Ice Age, but the trailer\ndoesn\u2019t really set it off right. A robot\nsays: \u201cI know this place like the back\nof my hand\u201d, then looks at his hand\nand says \u201chey, that\u2019s new!\u201d. Imagine\nhow long that took to come up with.\nBut with Chirs Wedge, the expectation is high; though it doesn\u2019t seem\nso funny.\nAs is always said, never judge a\nbook by its cover. After all, it\u2019s suppose to be a heart-warming story\nthat proves that a robot can shine\nno matter what he or she is made\nof. Well, if you would like to see what\nChris Wedge has done or see how a\nworld might exist if it was completely inhabited by robots (what would\nit look like? how would the robots\nact?) then go and see this film.\nVidula Vinayagamoorthy\nRobots\nDirector: Chris Wedge\nStarring: Ewan McGregor,\nRobin Williams, Greg Kinnear\nPreviews: March 12, 13\nReleased: March 18\nI can think of easier ways to make babies\nListings: page 17\n\u201cThe expectation\nis high; though it\ndoesn\u2019t seem so\nfunny\u201d\n\u201cIt will be interesting\nto see how Scott has\ndealt with the\nsensitive issue of\nthe Crusades\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005 5\nIn February, the Kyoto\nProtocol limped comically\ninto effect, and for those\nwho believe generally in the\npredictions of science, the\ndecrepitude of Kyoto hurts\nlike a laughter stitch. It is\npathos at its most excruciat-ing. It is a satire on itself.\nFor thirteen aching years, the\ncreators of the agreement\nhave been at the throbbing\nnexus of economic, scientific\nand political information.\nArmed with the sword of\nreason, and set against a\nbackdrop of impending dis-aster, these trusty guardians\nof our future have tirelessly\nnegotiated the Protocol\u2019s\ndetails. They\u2019ve thrusted,\nthey\u2019ve parried, they\u2019ve com-promised, they\u2019ve traded,\nthey\u2019ve amended, they\u2019ve\npushed and they\u2019ve pulled\nand they\u2019ve come up with a\nreduction in global greenhouse gas emissions of 4.8%\nbelow the 1990 level.\nMost scientists in a position\nto comment will tell you this\nisn\u2019t enough. In fact it\u2019s hilarious in its inadequacy. It\u2019s\n\u2018duck and cover\u2019 for human-ity. Even if it were to be fully\nimplemented for 100 years it\nwouldn\u2019t be enough. Even if\nit included the United States,\nChina, India and Australia, it\nwouldn\u2019t be enough.\nIn fact, plot the predicted\ntemperature rise over time\nwith no reduction in carbon\nemissions next to the temperature rise with the Kyoto\ntargets and the lines stay as\nclose as Laurel and Hardy.\nBut here\u2019s the punchline: the\nprotocol is set to expire in\n2012 and, due to American\nsabotage, no plans have yet\nbeen made for a replace-ment.\nAs if that weren\u2019t painful\nenough, some critics estimate that this piecemeal gesture will cost $1 trillion. So\ngeared is the global economy\nto the release of carbon into\nthe atmosphere that even\nthis vague attempt towards\nsustainability costs roughly\n4% of the sum of all involved\ncountries\u2019 GDPs. This is why\nthe US doesn\u2019t want to get\ninvolved.\nSome in the US are also\nconcerned that Kyoto is\nEuropean and Eastern imperialism through the back door\n(which is funny when set\nagainst the imperialist implications of one twentieth of\nthe world\u2019s population using a\nquarter of its energy output),\nbut mainly \u2013 to paraphrase\nBill Clinton, one among many\nto torment Kyoto \u2013 it\u2019s the\nstupid economy.\nAnd here lies the central\nparadox, which is the cornerstone of this epic tragicom-edy. All our main economic\nmodels are based on an infinite amount of resources and\nan infinite capacity for pollution to provide everlasting\neconomic expansion. This\nis the banana skin. This is\nwhat\u2019s providing the laughs.\nIt\u2019s Basil Fawlty\u2019s despera-tion, David Brent\u2019s vanity and\nFrank Spencer\u2019s well-mean-ing clumsiness together.\nScience, it is assumed, will\nprovide the answers to make\neconomies grow forever.\nBut it\u2019s now science that\nis telling us that there just\naren\u2019t infinite resources on\nthe planet and there isn\u2019t\ninfinite capacity for pollu-tion. Kyoto\u2019s feeble doddering\ncomes from trying to square\nan infinite model with a finite\nworld. And, to someone who\nbelieves in science, it seems\nthat the economic model has\nto change in some way. I don\u2019t\nknow how, but there has to\nbe someone out there clever\nenough to work it out, if only\nbecause the hapless fumbling\nof international policy-mak-ers is becoming less and less\nfunny.\nOh, Kyoto! What a complete farce\nWithout US participation and with targets set far below the levels demanded by scientists,\nRichard Fenning asks how anyone could take the Kyoto protocol seriously\nAlternative medicines on trial\nDo alternative therapies have any scientific basis?\nElena Lengthorn went to the Royal Institution to find out\nThis debate, one of the Royal\nInstitution\u2019sfirstpublicevents\nof the year, was inspired by\nthe publication of Times columnist Toby Murcott\u2019s book\nThe Whole Story: Alternative\nmedicine on trial?\nExpert witnesses came in\nthe form of Murcott himself;\nDr Mike Cummings, medical director of the Medical\nAcupuncture Society (MAS);\nand Dr Andrew Moore, editor of eBandolier.com, a\nwebsite on evidence-based\nhealth care. During one of\nthe Institution\u2019s Talking\nPoint events, the public were\nencouraged to quiz the speak-ers, and the questions were\nably directed from the chair\nby writer and broadcaster\nVivienne Parry.\nMurcott, one-time bio-chemist, began the event by\nreminding the audience that\ncomplementary medicine\nworked alongside to Western\nmedicine and not a replace-ment. Alternative medicines\ncannot be tested in the same\nway as conventional drugs.\nThe issue at stake for Murcott\nwas not whether the alternatives work, but whether\nscience can measure them\nworking. He also suggested\nthat more individualised\nalternative treatments create\na better relationship between\nthe practitioner and patient.\nIf a little massage therapy\nis making the difference and\ndoing the trick then why not\nuse it?\nA show of hands revealed\nthat over 50% of the audience\nin the auspicious Faraday\nLecture Theatre had undergone some form of complementary treatment. Clearly,\nmore and more people are\nclaiming benefits from\nalternative treatments, and\nMurcott would like to see science applied to verify them.\nThe second speaker of the\nevening was Mike Cummings,\na former RAF Medical Officer\nwho, bizarrely, learnt acupuncture during his service.\nDespite little favourable evidence at the time, he was\nkeen to continue with practising the therapy after success\nwith some difficult cases.\nAfter leaving the military and\ntaking over an acupuncture\nclinic, he started looking for\nscientific evidence for acupuncture and doing his own\nresearch. Cummings claims\nthat 85% of modern medicine\ndoes not have the sort of evidence that is demanded of\nacupuncture.\nFinally, Andrew Moore, the\nman with the evidence, crys-tallsied the debate down to\ntwo things, claiming the data\navailable was inadequate and\nover-sold. He provided compelling examples, including a\nwidely cited study on tennis\nelbow in the Rheumatology\njournal based on six trials.\nOne was not randomised,\nanother two were not \u2018double\nblind\u2019 (when both the patient\nand the practitioner are\n\u2018blind\u2019 to the treatment being\ngiven) and one was invalid.\nWarming to his theme, Moore\naccused the well-known\nCochrane Collaboration, a\nnon-profit outfit who provide\ninformation on the effects of\nhealth care, of over-selling.\nHe also suggested that evidence that acupuncture can\nbe dangerous and has injured\npatients exists. Although this\npoint was not disputed, the\nsmall numbers involved were\ninvoked: there have been an\nestimated ten deaths to date.\nThe event really brought\nthe lecture hall to life, with\nthe audience clamouring for\nVivienne\u2019s attention, and even\nshouting from the upper gallery to get questions heard.\nThe alternative therapists in\nthe audience were desperate\nto tell their stories, as were\nthose who had received treat-ment.\nOne couple enthusiastically recounted the tale of a\nneighbour\u2019s dog who received\nacupuncture once a month.\nWhether the ardour of the\naudience reflected general\npublic opinion, or just the\ninterest of those attracted to\nthe event, was unclear. What\nwas startlingly obvious from\nthe beginning was that many\nin the audience didn\u2019t need or\nwant evidence, just to share\ntheir experiences. For them,\nat least, anecdotal evidence\nwas enough.\nKyoto: when it comes down to it, isn\u2019t it all a bit of a joke?\nAs you all know, this year is\nEinstein Year.\nAside from the plethora\nof events being organised\naround the globe to celebrate physics, PhySoc have\nalso been heavily involved in\norganising things. As part of\nan outreach programme, students have ventured into local\nschools and given a series of\nlessons and demonstrations\non physics.\nIn addition, this Saturday\nis the Big Day of Physics at\nImperial\u2019s physics depart-ment. People from all over\nLondon are welcome to\nattend. There are plans for\na two hour challenge to take\nplace in the morning, where\nschoolchildren from the outreach programme will build\ndemonstrations on various\nphysical concepts.\nAfter lunch and a judging\nsession, there will be lectures\nrunning for the more mature\naudience, including topics\nsuch as Life As A Quantum\nMechanic and Physics And\nCreativity. Whilst the lectures go on, there will be a\nsimultaneous series of smaller seminars and group discussions \u2013 two on environmental issues, one on music\nand one on life as a physics\nstudent.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Chris Rowlands\nAvid readers of Felix may\nhave noticed a large number\nof reports in the sports pages\ninvolving the little known but\nvery sexy sport of Ultimate\nFrisbee. It is a fact of life\nthat frisbees are cool, but if\nyou don\u2019t really fancy running around after 175g of\naerodynamic plastic, there is\nthe more sedate alternative\nof Frisbee Freestyle.\nWhile they\u2019re not getting\nVietnamese children to sew\nclothes together for Tiger\nWoods to flaunt himself in,\na certain multinational company recently decided that\nFreestyle was rather stylish.\nSince they spent rather a\nlarge amount of money on the\nidea, it would seem a shame\nnot to at least try it. The basic\nidea is that you spin the frisbee very fast, then toss it\naround your body in a variety\nof silly ways. Next, toss it to\nsomeone else, who does their\nown mean little manoeuvre,\nmuch like a plastic-assisted\nbreakdancing face-off, but\nwithout the bling and inevitable 14-year-old ghetto kid\ngoing \u201cman, that was whack\nfo\u2019 shizzle\u201d.\nThe first thing to do is get\nyour frisbee and spray the\nunderneath with silicon spray.\nThis will make it nice and\nslippery and make performing tricks much easier. Feel\nfree to make anything else\nnice and slippery as you see\nfit, and make sure you trim\nyour nails since they\u2019re going\nto be important in a minute.\nHold the frisbee like you\u2019re\nabout to throw it, but instead\nof throwing it a long way,\nthrow it only a short distance\nand with so much spin your\nwrist snaps [see picture 1].\nDo it a bit less next time\nthough. When it comes back\ndown, put your finger underneath it and let the frisbee\nspin on your nail. This is actually quite tricky as you have\nto move your finger so that\nit is under the lowest part of\nthe frisbee. But once it\u2019s spin-ning, you can appear both\nsmooth and sophisticated, as\nSteve demonstrates [see picture 2].\nFrom this position, you can\ntoss it into the air and catch it\nagain, bounce it off your knee\nor grind it on your teeth. You\ncan also perform chest rolls\n[see picture 3] and back rolls\n[see picture 4], although you\nmay find this easier if you\nmove your pony tail out of\nthe way.\nOnce you\u2019ve mastered all\nof the above, you are ready to\nfurther your mystical journey\ninto the finer aspects of fris-beetarianism (the belief that\nwhen someone dies, \u201chis soul\ngets flung onto a roof, and\njust stays there\u201d \u2013 George\nCarlin). For this, I can highly recommend contacting\njuggling@ic.ac.uk and telling\nus how clever you are. We\u2019ll\nbe in the union on Tuesdays\nfrom 6pm onwards, and just\nbefore this article ends, I\u2019d\nlike to thank the IC Disc\nDoctors for the loan of one\nof their frisbees, a replica\nof which can be seen in the\nUnion Bar for those of you\nwith sharp eyes and a taste\nfor real ale.\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE SEVEN: Frisbee freestyle\n1. Throw the frisbee a very short distance, with a lot of spin; 2. \u2018Catch\u2019 it and let it spin on your fingernail;\n3. Try a \u2018chest roll\u2019 if you\u2019re feeling adventurous; 4.

However\nlong you have to wait until\nseeing the latest DramSoc\nproduction, Noises Off by\nMichael Frayne, it will be too\nlong!\nDirected by Andre Refig,\nthis is sure to be an evening\nof farcical fun. How could\nanyone miss out on a play\nthat contains female leads\nwearing nothing but their\nunderwear and sardines that\ncan manage to attack actors\nat all the wrong moments?\nThe play is based on a theatre group\u2019s production Noises\nOn, but things are not going\nwell. With Lloyd, the sarcastic and perfectionist director,\nclashing with Selsdon, a geri-atric, alcohol-dependent old\nhack, and angry lovers being\nchased with fire axes, this\npromises to provide entertainment throughout.\nIt starts with a rehearsal for\nNoises On, which frankly isn\u2019t\ngoing well. As the show is on\nin only a few hours and some\npeople have had only a catnap\nbehind the sofa in the last 48\nhours, things are getting a bit\nstressful. With missed cues,\ndoors that can\u2019t open, and\ncharacters being assaulted\nwith various bunches of flow-ers, nothing starts smoothly.\nThis play really captures\nthe stress and sometimes\nextreme panic that settles in\nduring any production. The\ninherent trick in Noises Off is\nhow the cast have to execute\nthe same dialogue and complex entrances and moves,\nbut from the reverse perspec-tive. This is achieved by turning the whole set around during the second act! No mean\nfeat... but the show must go\non, even though there\u2019s utter\nbedlam backstage and the\nmatin\u00e9e is descending into a\ncomplete nightmare!\nI have to recommend this\nlatest offering from our resident thespians, as it brings\ntogether wit with intellectual\nofferings, which many farces\nfind difficult. Showing Monday\n14 March to Thursday 17\nMarch at 7.30pm in the Union\nConcert Hall, it\u2019s only \u00a34:50\nfor students and \u00a36 others.\nDramsoc presents...\nan evening of farcical fun\nDRAMSOC\n3 4\nFemale leads wearing nothing but their underwear?

    "content": "FILM film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSam Raimi\u2019s production of Boogey\nMan exploits all of those fears of\nthe dark that we had as children\n\u2013 things that go bump in the night,\neerie shadows, shifty shapes and\nthat sinisterly semi-open closet\ndoor. Boogey Man does a good job of\ncreating that all-too-familiar sense\nof fear most of us harboured as\nchildren, only this time it\u2019s better\nbecause we can take refuge in the\nfact that it is being played out on\na screen in front of us rather than\nexperiencing it directly again.\nThe film opens with eight-year-old Tim Jensen trying to sleep in\nhis room at night. His imagination\nruns into overdrive and everything\nin his room seems to take on sinister\nand ghastly shapes in the moon-light. After repeatedly opening and\nclosing his bedside lamp to confirm\nthere is nothing in the room with\nhim, his father finally enters and\nscolds him for his irrational fears.\nIn order to prove there is no \u2018boogey\nman\u2019, Tim\u2019s father makes a show\nof searching through the room and\nloudly announcing its absence. That\nis until Tim points to his slightly ajar\ncloset door. The father approaches\nthe closet and is suddenly seized\nand pulled inside by something and\nthen disappears forever. And so\nbegins Boogey Man.\nNow, fifteen years on, Tim (Barry\nWatson) is a successful magazine\neditor, engaged to his girlfriend and\ncolleague Jessica (Tory Mussett).\nUnable to put the past behind him,\nhe still harbours a fear of closets\nand has not been home since the\nincident with his father fifteen years\nago. He receives a phone call at\nhis girlfriend\u2019s house one weekend\ninforming him of his mother\u2019s death\n(possibly another victim of the boogey man?) and decides he has to confront his fears by returning to the\nhouse \u2013 the place it all started \u2013 and\nspending the night there.\nThe actual idea behind the film\nmust be commended. Sam Raimi\nand Stephen Kay do a good job of\ndeveloping the story in such a way\nthat it keeps you guessing through-out, at who \u2013 or what \u2013 the boogey\nman actually is. Is it just a figment\nof the protagonist\u2019s imagination or\nis it really something supernatural?\nThe film also has some good frights\npacked in \u2013 things that will make\nyou jump in your seat and make\nyour heart beat faster.\nHowever the film lacked a lot,\nwhich is the reason why Boogey\nMan failed to make the mark.\nDialogue and character development are virtually non-existent \u2013\nyou end up neither knowing nor caring about Tim\u2019s new girlfriend. Tim\nalso meets his childhood friend Kate\nwhen he returns home. Although\nthere are hints of sexual tension\nbetween the two, the relationship\nis completely overlooked in order\nto make way for sweeping, badly\nangled camera shots of the house\n\u2013 something you already get plenty\nof. Add in some completely random\nplot \u2018asides\u2019 such as a little girl who\nknows the truth about the boogey\nman and an uncle who gets shrink-wrapped, and you get a better idea\nof just how much of a non-event the\nactual plot was.\nPlot holes aside, perhaps the biggest letdown was the ending. It\njust was not scary \u2013 simple as that.\nSeveral loose ends were left untied\n\u2013 the mystery behind Tim\u2019s uncle\u2019s\ngruesome death and the point of\nthose missing children with a grey\nhue just weren\u2019t explained.\nOverall, the film is suitable for\nsome gasp-out-loud frights, but\nif you want to see a movie that\nactually has a plot, stay in your\ncloset when Boogey Man rolls into\ntown.\nWho\u2019s hiding in your closet?\nAn opportunity to exploit childhood nocturnal fears is missed in a second-rate horror, writes\nMarya Ziauddin.

Often sensa-tionalised in the media, we are told\nit is a clear black and white issue,\nwhere paedophiles are quite clearly\nevil people.\nSo it\u2019s very strange to think that\nanyone would want to make an entire\nfilm about this controversial issue.\nAs distasteful as the concept may\nbe, it\u2019s approached with surprising\nsensitivity and taste. The Woodsman\nis a courageous and often moving\ndrama about a convicted paedophile\ntrying to go straight.\nKevin Bacon stars as Walter\nRossworth, a convicted paedophile\nwho has just been released from\nprison after serving 12 years and\ngets a job in a Philadelphia lumber yard. It\u2019s not such a good idea,\nthough, that his downtown apartment is opposite a primary school.\nAt the local lumber yard he meets\nand begins a strange affair with\nVickie (Kyra Sedgwick). Vickie, who\ntakes an instant shine to a loner-like\nWalter, is ready to confess her worst\nsins to him, but he is not inclined to\nreciprocate. And, when he finally\ndoes, he immediately shows her the\ndoor since his guilt and embarrassment makes it extremely difficult\nfor him to stay with someone once\nhis secret is revealed. Walter seems\nkind and repentant, yet can he ever\ntruly be forgiven or trusted again?\nHow much sympathy can we\nextend to a man who has done the\nthings Walter has, and who may still\nbe capable of doing them?\nTo its credit, The Woodsman does\nnot try to force too much compassion on us, or to advance any plea on\nWalter\u2019s behalf, apart from the recognition of his humanity. For some\nviewers \u2013 as for some of Walter\u2019s coworkers and family members \u2013this\nmay be too much to ask. But the\nmovie neither excuses nor exploits\nhim, and instead regards him with\nwary, ambivalent curiosity.\nThe whole thing hinges on Bacon\u2019s\nperformance, and his quiet, brooding turn is among the best work\nhe\u2019s ever done. He\u2019s also backed\nby a solid cast with good contributions from both Sedgwick (his\nreal-life wife) and Benjamin Bratt,\nwho plays Walter\u2019s understanding\nbrother-in-law. It is hard to doubt\nBacon, who has already been widely\npraised for his bravery in taking on\nsuch an unpalatable role. Walter is\nliterally being torn apart by his own\nself-contempt. Holding on Bacon\u2019s\nface in tight close-up, Kassell gazes,\namazed as he acts with every mus-cle, every pore of his body.\nOther great performances include\nMos Def as a local cop making it very\nclear that he\u2019s keeping a close eye\non Walter. There is some fantastic\ndialogue between Sergeant Lucas\nand Walter. Def plays a unique and\nespecially human police officer who\nsees it as his mission to put scum\nlike Walter back in jail. Lucas can\u2019t\nunderstand why such criminals\nare ever released into society. And\nprepare to be amazed by Hannah\nPilkes, who plays one of the film\u2019s\npotential victims. It\u2019s unsettling and\nabsolutely mesmerising.\nThe movie provides no easy\nanswers, and it has the good sense\nto know when to shut up and let the\nimages tell the story. The way Walter\nlooks away from adults and at little\ngirls says things more powerfully\nthan any dialogue ever could.\nThe Woodsman is very well directed for a debut. Kassell\u2019s direction\nis visually strong without becoming\na distraction. She directs the film\nin an unassuming, stripped-down\nstyle, avoiding any visual or narrative clutter that would pull attention\naway from the actors.\nWalter\u2019s quest for normality isn\u2019t\neasy, and it isn\u2019t linear. In fact, it isn\u2019t\nclear if he\u2019ll ever make it. As he tells\nVickie, most paedophiles are never\ncured and end up reincarcerated.\nThe resolution the picture offers\nmay be more hopeful than believa-ble, but the filmmakers nonetheless\nmake an honest attempt to avoid\neither prurient sensationalism or\nfake redemption.\nThe subject matter alone will be\nenough to keep some audiences from\nseeing The Woodsman. However, I\nwould strongly suggest you go and\nsee this film, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel.\nHaj Alttahir\nThe Woodsman\nDirector: Nicole Kassell\nStarring: Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick\nLength: 88 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHI\nCrash landing onto a screen near you\n\u201cThe Woodsman is\nabout a convicted\npaedophile trying to\ngo straight\u201d\nKeanu Reeves in Constantine: it\u2019s\nthe Matrix wardrobe again\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\n28\n\n"

But\nSpirit was a horse. Winston\nChurchill wasn\u2019t a horse but\nI bet he liked them... almost\ntoo much... but that\u2019s not the\npoint.\nSo another competition\nyear is over for the Imperial\nCollege Riding Club B/Shield\nTeam. The word \u2018year\u2019 is used\nin the loosest sense as we\nonly competed in four competitions against the same\nthree teams; Reading, RVC\nand Surrey.\nThe second competition was\nthe RVC home competition,\nheld in the delightful township\nof Slough. Cold, early mornings aren\u2019t conducive to me\nbeing in the best of moods so\nwhat could have made the day\nbetter? It sure wasn\u2019t waiting\noutside in the cold at 8am\nfor our driver. What it was,\nthough, was the lack of mini-bus. That\u2019s right. No showing up in classy IC minibus\nstyle for us. Instead, we had\nto sprint across Hyde Park\nto Paddington, considerably\nweighed down by our extensive riding kit: hats, boots,\nwhips (ooh-err) and back\nprotectors (similar to Kevlar\nstab-proof vests).\nSo what, I hear you ask,\nactually happened at the com-petition? Well, as is normal,\ndressage was first up for the\nday. I took a gingery (chest-nut) animal who was apparently still a baby, Kat rode\nMouse, Sarah was on a small\npony called Becky and El\nchose Rocket who was reappearing from last year.\nNothing terrible happened\nand I was able to perfect\nmy dressage reading abil-ity. Lunch was mediocre, a\nfew sandwiches and \u2018Nice\u2019\nbiscuits: disappointing really\nafter Reading\u2019s banquet from\nthe previous week, but free\nlunch is free lunch. When\nyou\u2019re standing outside in the\ncold for six hours, you learn to\nvalue your lunch.\nAnyway, jumping closed the\nday. All four teams gathered\noutside the arena to watch\nthe horses warm up. Kat was\ndelegated to ride Aria again\nthis year, a chunky grey mare.\nSarah took Acti who I had done\nwell on last year, and El rode\nDutch who had tossed her off\nlast year (pun intended?)\nOnce again, \u2018dumb-as-nails\u2019\nKate (me) took on the powerhouse giraffe-on-speed that\nwas Figaro. But we all sur-vived, which was nice. There\nwere no frightful incidences\nto report, except that one of\nthe Reading girls didn\u2019t pay\nmuch attention and went\nthrough the jump rather than\nover it. Their grave mistake\nwas our outrageous gain and\nwe actually, truly, for once,\ndidn\u2019t lose! We came third and\nI got an individual 7th. A good\nday for all.\nA week later, it was our\nturn to host the ceremony\nand we were allowed to do it\nat midday as opposed to stupid o\u2019clock. This week Sarah\nwas replaced by Jess. Now,\nthe point of home competitions is a home advantage.\nOr so I have always been led\nto believe. However I feel as\nthough I have been lied to. For\nall the money I spent learning\nhow to ride Pablo, I may as\nwell have not bothered as we\ndidn\u2019t produce the goods. Kat\nrode Sushi: I didn\u2019t see it but\nunfortunately someone else\ndid amazing on that pony so\nKat suffered numerous penal-ties. Jess and Storm did fine\nand Jess got the best score,\nmeaning no penalties. El and\nLily performed a good, test\neven though Lily resembles\na mule. Can you guess what\ncame next? Yes, lunchtime\nfollowed by jumping. Can you\nsee the pattern?\nWhile we ate, we watched\n(some with excitement, some\nwith apprehension) as the\njumping course was erected.\nThe aforementioned emotions increased as the A team\ndemonstrated how good our\nhorses can be. BJ, Flash and\nTrio wowed the other teams\nwith their speed and agil-ity. Avignon caused people\nto bury faces in sleeves to\nstop laughter being heard.\nOK, so it wasn\u2019t that bad but\nshe did just blankly refuse to\njump and so enter Shannyn\n\u2018squeals-like-a-pig\u2019 to act as a\nreplacement.\nThe long and the short of it\nwas that our jumping course\ncaused numerous problems.\nThere were poles down everywhere and a few refusals\nthrown in for good measure.\nBut us IC girls came out tops\nand won ourselves another\nthird place, Jess got herself\nan individual 2nd and I got an\nindividual 5th. So again, not a\ncompletely failed day.\nFinally the last competition\nwas held in Farnham, home\nto the Surrey girls. We arrived\nridiculously early thanks to\nLuke, our chauffeur for the\nday. What have I said about\nearly mornings? Throw in\nthe fact that it was hovering around two degrees and\nI was not the happiest bunny.\nThe Reading girls got lost en\nroute, delaying the start of the\nfight... I mean competition.\nThe horses weren\u2019t anything\nspecial and there\u2019s nothing\nto really say about them. We\ndid what we try to do best\nbut usually end up failing at,\nand went to work on the dressage tests. No-one appeared\nto do terribly on our side. The\njudge once again thought oth-erwise, and the marking was\nextremely questionable which\ndidn\u2019t improve the bleak day.\nLunch was terrible. And\njumping just capped it off. The\ncourse was NOT an actual\ncourse. It was just numerous\nrandomly numbered jumps\nwhich happened, by chance,\nto be spatially similar in terms\nof being enclosed by the same\nfence. It caused us to force\nthe horses to bend in ways\nthat would make a Cirque du\nSoleil contortionist wince.\nNeedless to say, the jumping was humorous but not\nbeneficial to our team score.\nJess barely managed to drag\nher tired and flat-footed steed\naround and took several poles\nand jump wings with her. I\ngot one pole down on the\npro-show jumper who was\nminus an important piece of\ntack (in my opinion), El had\na similar round and Kat took\non \u2018Georgina Ballerina\u2019, who\ncould be likened to one of the\nhippos from Fantasia, but all\nwent well. And the results? A\nnot unexpected fourth place\nfor Imperial College, with Kat\nand El getting 7th and 6th\nplace respectively in the indi-viduals.\nSo that was that. Final count\nfor Imperial: two third places,\ntwo fourths and a smattering\nof individuals. We lost of the\nleague, RVC won the league\nbut fun was had by all. At\nleast, I hope we all had fun.\nFun tended to be had most by\nme in the Union later those\nWednesday evenings. The\nUnion encourages me to drink\nresponsibly, but seeing as I\nhad to drink for four people...\nRIDING\nRiding roundup Results\nMONDAY\n28 FEBRUARY\nFOOTBALL\nHolloway Men\u2019s 5th 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 0\nNETBALL\nGoldsmiths Women\u2019s 2nd 11\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 28\nGoldsmiths Women\u2019s 1st 13\nICSM Women\u2019s 2nd 22\nTUESDAY\n1 MARCH\nBASKETBALL\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 43\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 45\nWEDNESDAY\n2 MARCH\nFENCING\nReading Women\u2019s 1st 135\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 89\nFOOTBALL\nRoyal Free Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 3\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nHOCKEY\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 4\nICSM Men\u2019s 1st 2\nGKT Men\u2019s 1st 1\nPortsmouth Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nICSM Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nICSM Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nRSM Men\u2019s 1st 1\nGoldsmiths Women\u2019s 1st 8\nICSM Women\u2019s 3rd 0\nLACROSSE\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 4\nBath Women\u2019s 1st 15\nTABLE TENNIS\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 4\nYork Men\u2019s 1st 12\nSATURDAY\n5 MARCH\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 0\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 5th 5\nSt Bart\u2019s Men\u2019s 2nd 2\nKing\u2019s Men\u2019s 5th 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 1\nSchool of Pharmacy Men\u2019s 1st6\nSt Bart\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rd 3\nICSM Men\u2019s 4th 0\nSUNDAY\n6 MARCH\nNETBALL\nGKT Women\u2019s 2nd 10\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 0\nSponsored by\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 4\nGKT Women\u2019s 1st 3\nBy Hannah Marshall\nWhat a nail-biting finish to\nthe ULU League! ULU ladies\u2019\npremier two teams battled\nit out on Monday night at\nHarlington in a match where\neverything was at stake. IC\nhad to beat GKT to stay in\ncontention to win the league,\nwhile GKT only had to draw\nor win to gain top spot.\nThe match started with\nImperial dominating play,\nmoving the ball decisively\naround the pitch and creating\na decent array of chances. A\nshock goal from GKT against\nthe run of play in the first half\ntook the wind out of IC\u2019s sails\nfor a while, but they fought on\nrelentlessly, building play and\nlooking the sharper team.\nStill 1-0 down at half time,\nbut full of optimisim, IC\nagain set the pace after the\nrestart.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before some\npromising pressing play was\nrewarded by a short corner\nin the Imperial side\u2019s favour,\nand Helene Wehrmann put a\nvenomous shot in the bottom\nright corner to bring it back\nlevel.\nThe cold of the night and\nmurmurs of flu took their toll\nfor a while, as IC were forced\nto absorb some pressure\nthemselves, with GKT determined not to be made to look\nstupid. Two rather unfortunate goals were conceded by\nIC as concentration lapsed,\nand they found themselves\n3-1 down.\nIt took a second delightful\nthrough pass fromWehrmann\nto the slick stick of Roxy FP\nfor IC to pull back a slither of\nhope and bring the score to a\nmore respectable 3-2.\nThen, with ten minutes\nremaining, Helene really did\nhave the goal in her sights\nthat night, working even more\nmagic with a second short\ncorner conversion, making it\nall even at 3-3.\nIC knew that a draw simply wasn\u2019t good enough, and\nin the dying minutes Helene\nand Roxy joined forces again,\nwith Roxy\u2019s touch on a flying pass from midfield just\nenough to send the ball over\nher shoulder and that of the\nrooted GKT \u2018keeper. A sure\ncontender for goal of the sea-son, not to mention the fact\nthat it won the game for IC at\na tense 4-3 final scoreline.\nWhilst Roxy and Helene\nstole the show in terms of\ngoal scoring, the defeat of\nGKT was at the hands of a\nformidible team effort, and\neveryone played exceptionally well.\nNow all that remains is to\nbeat them again in the final of\nthe ULU Cup when we have a\nfull strength team... bring on\nthose GKT Medics!\nHOCKEY\n\u2018Goal of the season\u2019 brings dramatic triumph\n\n"

    "content": "THEATRE\nTaking a break from the West End\ntheatre scene can be refreshing, but\nit can also be risky. If you like to take\nrisks and see new plays, and support\nthe arts in a way that might actually\nbenefit the growth of fringe theatres,\nI encourage you to take a step out\nand do some research on the theatres that house this kind of work.\nBut don\u2019t go to The Most\nHumane Way to Kill a Lobster, at\nleast not until the end of the run.\nPerhaps, by then, it might have\na bit more meat on its bones and\nbe able to pull off what put me off.\nFirst time playwright Duncan\nMacmillan and first time director Claire Lizzimore are just that\n\u2013 first-timers. There were several\nmotifs and effects that they both\nwanted to incorporate, but it came\nacross as a desperate attempt at\nan ideal that just can\u2019t be fulfilled\nin small theatre, with a small cast,\nand with an under-worked script.\nInexperience isn\u2019t terrible, however \u2013 this production was a great\nway to watch progress. It would be\ninteresting to see the show twice;\nonce at the beginning and once at\nthe end of the run in order to see\nhow the show has improved.\nThe Most Humane Way to Kill a\nLobster is about anything but. There\nmay have been a motif or symbol\nof some sort involved there, but I\nmissed it. Loretta, played by Holly\nde Jong, is an estranged mother disconnected from the rest of the world.\nThroughout the play she is gaining\ncourage to confront a dark spot in\nher past while maintaining a home\nand raising a daughter.\nLoretta is the only character who\nspeaks for the whole of the play. At\nthe supposed climactic point of the\nplay, one other character speaks,\nbut it doesn\u2019t really set his character\napart from Loretta\u2019s in any sense.\nI\u2019m sure the directors want to\nsend the message: it\u2019s not what we\nsay but what we don\u2019t say, but this\ntired clich\u00e9 is just that \u2013 tired, overused and overemphasised. The only\nway most directors and playwrights\nknow how to convey this message\nis by talking too much and giving\nemphasis on silence at the climax,\nwhich tends to be more annoying\nthan anything else.\nCharacter development in this\nproduction was rather poor. I could\ntell that the actors could give more\nthan they were giving; they all had\nthe potential to do far better. None\nof them were truly in the moment,\nI saw each of them thinking about\ntheir next move before they made it\nand calculating what their response\nwould be to their scene partner. Most\naudiences can see that, and many\nactors think they can ride on past\nwithout anyone noticing, but audiences are smarter than you think\nand they are a massive beast that\ncan tear a production to shreds if the\nactor isn\u2019t in the moment.\nSo the lesson here is that progress\nis great but new writers and directors shouldn\u2019t bite off more than\nthey can chew if they want to be\nsuccessful. Baby steps are the safest route.\nPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of this one,\nperhaps you\u2019ve heard too much\nabout this show. Maybe you\u2019re sick\nof the publicity it\u2019s getting. I was too.\nThat\u2019s why I saw it. Hype is hype,\nladies and gents, and you never\nknow how things really go down\nunless you see them with your own\neyes.\nSo I feasted my sights upon Patrick\nStewart and Joshua Jackson in their\nperformances of David Mamet\u2019s A\nLife in the Theatre.\nForthosenotfamiliarwithMamet\u2019s\nplays, they are all full of short lines\nmeant to be carried as realistic conversations with the characters interrupting each other, interrupting\nthemselves and responding quickly\nto the many things going on around\nthem. There are no dramatic pauses\nor thoughtful self-righteous scenes\nfor the actors to embellish.\nMamet is also very anticlimac-tic. He despises the \u2018shock and awe\nfactor\u2019 in the clich\u00e9 sense. Mamet\nstrives to shock audiences by showing them a very raw vision of life.\nHe uses dry humour to make his\naudiences laugh, and as soon as\nthe audience is used to laughing he\nsubtly grabs them by the balls and\nmakes them cry.\nThis particular Mamet play is\nabout two characters, one young\nand one old, one with experience and\none without, and you follow them on\na journey through, pardon my pun, a\nlife in the theatre.\nJoshua Jackson, while dreamy and\nall that good stuff, played more than\nan inexperienced actor \u2013 he was\none. Next to a marvel like Patrick\nStewart, it took me a while to discover Jackson\u2019s character. He was\nout for the laughs and when he got\nthem, he became more relaxed and\neased into it. But actors should not\ndepend on their audiences for suc-cess. They must be able to hold their\nown, and I noticed him struggling\nwith that.\nPatrick Stewart, on the other hand,\nwas astounding. His performance\nwould make Mamet cry. He obviously understood Mamet\u2019s intentions with the character and the play\nand carried them out with apparent\nease. Hurrah for actors who study\ntheir playwrights!\nThe set and lighting were very\nclever and should be studied by\nthose considering a career in both\nfields. On the surface it was very\nsimple, but this sort of simplicity is\nrather hard to come by in a successful fashion. The actors, when \u2018performing\u2019, played to an audience that\nwas behind them. Our backstage\nwas their audience, and their backstage was where the audience was.\nBut the way the drop was painted\nand the way the lights were used,\nyou could almost see the mirror\nimage of yourself watching the play\nthey were putting on for another\nfictional audience.\nOut of all the West End shows\nI\u2019ve read about and seen, I think\nthis one is the most worth the theatregoers\u2019 money. It has a splash of\nAmerica with British theatre experience that balances and carries itself\nvery well.\nThe Most Humane Way To\nKill A Lobster\nCloses 19 March\nTheatre 503\nLachmere Pub\nBattersea Park Road, SW11\nBox Office: 020 7978 7040\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nLobsters and a different opinion\nTatum Fjerstad checks out the hype and gives new talent a chance\nEXHIBITION\nA lot has been said about Matisse.\nHe\u2019s been referred to as both\n\u2018unchallenging\u2019 and \u2018a genius\u2019,\nand vast numbers of exhibitions\nhave been devoted to his work. He\nenjoyed success in his lifetime and\ncontinues to be popular. Matisse is\nknown by most and should, in fact,\nbe a part of anyone\u2019s knowledge of\nart and artists. So, with this recom-mendation, I do urge you to book\ntickets and go to the new show at\nthe Royal Academy.\nI particularly love Matisse for\nhis use of colour: the colours are\nbold, bright and exquisite. However,\nthe focus of this exhibition is not\nso much colour but Matisse\u2019s fascination with and use of textiles\nthroughout his lifetime. The exhibition charts the involvement of\nMatisse with textiles form birth to\nthe end of his career.\nIt\u2019s often easy to overlook the\ninfluence of textiles on the composition of Matisse\u2019s work; however,\nthis exhibition snaps them all into\nfocus very effectively and with a\nlasting effect. Samples of textiles\nfrom the artist\u2019s hometown as well\nas pieces representative of his personal collection are shown alongside the paintings that used them as\ninspiration.\nOne of the many treats in this\nexhibition (while it is small, it does\npack in a lot) are the paintings\non loan from the Hermitage in St\nPetersburg. Many of the paintings\nwill be familiar to cognoscenti, at\nleast in style and content even if\nthey\u2019ve never seen them, but the\npaintings on loan from Russia will\nbe new to most and represent a\nperiod of Matisse\u2019s artistic development that many will be unfamiliar\nwith.\nOther pieces meriting one\u2019s special attention are the collage and\npaint works. These are what could\nbe called the culmination of his\nobsession with textiles, forms and\ncolour. In his later life, Matisse\ndevoted increasingly more time\nto these, producing some truly\nstunning works of impressive\nsimplicity. What is missing from\nthe exhibition, however, are his\nchasubles, but these are included in\nthe catalogue.\nI do suggest booking tickets in\nadvance for this show, or at least\nattempting to turn up at not particularly normal gallery-going time, as\nit is likely to be a very busy one.

    "content": "14 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Louisa Evans\nDid anyone notice those three\nlarge, white trucks parked up\nby the Sherfield Building?\nOne of them had a microwave\ndish sticking out of the top,\nwith the sacred markings of\nthe media on it: \u2018BBC\u2019. Simply\nlooking upon the three letters\nbrought thrills of excitement\nto the passers-by: I know,\nI saw you all turning your\nheads in excitement \u2013 I was\nwatching you from the walk-way!\nThe political heavyweight of\nthe televisual airwaves was in\nLondon. Question Time had\narrived at our very own Great\nHall. Kept that quiet, didn\u2019t\nthey?!\nWell, I suppose it is understandable really. They\nwouldn\u2019t want a bunch of\nnosy students rocking up and\npestering them with excited\nquestions, would they? Well,\nI ignored what my common\nsense was screaming at me\nand went behind the scenes\nto watch how a real television\nprogramme is put together.\nThe setup started at 7.30am\nand by 10am the set was built,\nthe lighting rigged and the\ngleaming white letters saying \u2018London\u2019 had been laid\nout ready for inspection by\nthe set designer, Paul Devine.\nNo one was overly impressed\nwhen some careless footwork\non my part sent them flying\nso they had to be relaid, but\nthe crew were looking a bit\nbored so I thought I\u2019d give\nthem something to do.\nThe set designer took me\nthrough the setup stage by\nstage. To light the four guests\nand David Dimbleby took\nno less than 72 individual\nlights. Sound was provided\nby two sets of microphones\nfor each of the panellists and\nsix boom mikes over various\nareas of the audience and, in\ntotal, 30 people were needed to get the show on the\nair. This made me stop and\nthink. Maybe that\u2019s where\nwe\u2019ve been going wrong at\nSTOIC (Student Television Of\nImperial College). We usually\nhave one guy on sound, one\non each camera (often just\none) and one guy to do vision\nmixing and directing (obvi-ously slightly redundant \u2013 or\nso we thought \u2013 with only one\ncamera). Hmm.\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that the\nreally exciting kit arrived, in\nthe shape of eight large format cameras and one \u2018glam\ncam\u2019 \u2013 a guy dressed in black\nrunning about the stage with\na hugely complicated but\nimpressively effective steadi-cam, followed closely behind\nby a guy carrying the cables.\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like a great\njob description, but it was fast\nwork and you get to be on television loads!\nShortly after everything\nwas plugged in, the floor manager called us over to actually sit as the panel to finalise\nthe camera shots to be used,\nthe lighting and the sound.\nVery cool. I didn\u2019t dare move,\nbut just about the best bit\nwas when they did a steadi-cam rehearsal for the title\nsequence.\n\u201cCue music! And go!\u201d and\nthe Question Time theme\ntune rang out over our heads\nas the lights came up. Even\ncooler.\nProbably the most amusing\nevents of the day in hindsight\nwas when one of the crew\napproached me rather tentatively and asked if I was\nKaren. Before I could reply\nshe said, \u201c...because there\nare two guys from Special\nBranch looking for you down\nthere, can you go and talk to\nthem?\u201d\nI practically jumped out of\nmy seat. I definitely wasn\u2019t\nKaren and on no account\ndid I want to be mistaken for\nanyone who was wanted by\nSpecial Branch!\n\u201cErr, no!\u201d I stammered.\nThe woman asking me was\ntaken aback by my abrupt, if\nfaltering, response, \u201cgosh no,\nI don\u2019t know who Karen is, I\u2019m\njust a student!\u201d It wasn\u2019t until\nlater that it dawned on me.\nFar from seeking out a fugitive who had gone into hiding\nat Imperial College, the two\npolice officers were probably\ninterested in the fact that\nthe Home Secretary, Charles\nClarke MP\n, and the shadow\nhome secretary, David Davis\nMP\n, were about to show up.\nDimbleby himself arrived a\nfew hours before the show\nwas to go on air. It was really\ninteresting seeing him walk\non set. A bit stereotypically, he\nwas followed by an entourage\nof trendily-dressed young\nladies gushing at him about\nhow great it was to see him\netc, and as soon as he arrived\nall the newspaper-reading\nloungers seemed to sit up a\nbit more straight and a hush\ndescended on the crew. Well,\nto some extent. The uber-cool\npointedly ignored his arrival\nin an \u2018I-know-you\u2019re-here-butI\u2019m-choosing-to-ignore-you\u2019\nway.\nThere was definitely a\nchange in atmosphere in\nresponse to Dimbleby\u2019s arrival though. He did a couple\nof interviews for them (more\never-so-grateful gushing) and\nthen moved on to recording\nthe trailer for the show to be\nbroadcast in only a couple of\nhours, before the news. He\nwas a lot more playful and\nlight-hearted than I imagined \u2013 the serious, hard-hit-ting Dimbleby seemed to be\nreserved for the politicians\nonly, and I felt very smug at\nthat. He clearly enjoyed his\nwork and spoke of how it was\nvery important for the BBC\nto keep the public informed\nof global events that changed\nthe lives of thousands of people as well as the domestic\npolitics hitting our headlines\non most days.\nThe trailer took only two\ntakes, with the minimal\namount of fuss and both-er. Then it was down to\nrehearsals. Again, I was a\nlittle bemused \u2013 Dimbleby,\nrehearsing? But it was true:\nI saw it with my own eyes. I\neven recorded it with STOIC\u2019s\nown camera, until he started waving his hand at me\nand pointing urgently as the\ntheme tune rolled out once\nagain. At first I thought he\nwas just being friendly, even\nhumouring me. Then I realised it wasn\u2019t quite a cheeky\nglint in his eye and I dropped\nthe camera out of sight, like a\npaparazzi caught red-handed.\nHe was fairly jovial about it,\nexplaining to me that rehearsals are, in fact, confidential\nand asked me who I was filming for. I gushed and giggled\nout an answer, much to my\nown embarrassment. All the\ncameras were trained on me\nat the time \u2013 this wasn\u2019t how\nI had wanted to introduce\nmyself!\nRehearsals were pretty\nquick and we were sat in\nthe audience and grilled by\nDimbleby (again \u2013 but in a\nnice way) as part of the sound\ncheck. That was pretty exciting too. The topic of the day\nwas the case of the young\nMuslim girl who had won the\ncase against her school about\nher wish to wear a more\nmodest uniform in accordance with her view of Islam.\nI thought I had the subject off\npat, but when you get pointed\nat by the man himself and the\nwhole crew is silent (with the\ndirector in the outside broadcast truck outside), it feels\nlike being interrogated by the\nGestapo! I was truly in awe of\nhis superpowers.\nI got to chat to Dimbleby\nafter the rehearsals were\nover on a PR venture promoting STOIC. He was quite surprised \u2013 and impressed\n\u2013 to find that we did all of our\nwork for the sheer love of it\nand didn\u2019t get any accreditation towards our degrees.\nI stopped short of giving\nhim a business card though\n(I got them done for free at\nVistaPrint, trouble is, that\u2019s\nexactly what they say on the\nback). Besides, I had given\none to Paul Devine earlier in\nthe day, and he\u2019d even come\nover to our studio... obviously\nto see who his closest rivals\nin the ruthless world of media\nwere and steal our secrets.\nThe show went on air at\n10.35pm. Apart from the bit\nwhen Charles Clarke MP\ndropped his tie-clip microphone and nearly burst our\neardrums, the recording\nlooked ridiculously easy.\nEverything ran so smoothly.\nAlmost like a STOIC produc-tion. It had made for a pretty\ninformative and very exciting day for all \u2013 Dimbleby\nhad never imagined getting\non STOIC.\nDramsoc helped the crew\ntake down their kit, and reality fell upon us all once more.\nThe tantalising, heady touch\nof the media world had passed\nand, as we stood there, waving the trucks off into the\nmoonlight, we all shared the\nsame thought. Could we put\nthis on our CVs as work experience if we applied to the\nBBC?\nFor more information\nabout making television programmes or filming events,\ncontact us at info@stoictv.\ncom.\nBehind the scenes at Question Time\nTwo members of Imperial\u2019s own television station found their way behind the scenes\nwhen David Dimbleby and his team set up shop in the Great Hall last week\nSTOIC\nSTOIC\u2019s David Balfour practises his debating skills on the Question Time panel\nImperial\u2019s Great Hall is transformed into a BBC studio\n\n"

There\u2019s two points\nfor each corrrect answer, making a\nhuge 48 points available. It\u2019s enough\nto let some of you catch up!\n1. Way back in the autumn term,\nwe did our very first issue. Nobody\nentered. Shame really, \u2018cos it\nwas great. The main feature was\nMission: Imperial, where we took a\npicture of the Felix tank and you had\nto tell us where it was in College.\nWe\u2019ve since lost the tank so, we\u2019ve\nused The Hoff instead. Guess what\nwe want you to tell us about this pic-ture? (Clue: tell us where it is)\n2. In our second issue we did one\nof our favourite quizzes, Whose\nBreasts Are These? For some\nreason the editor wasn\u2019t too keen\nthough, something about \u2018too much\nnipple\u2019. But who\u2019s this?\n3. George W Bush Is Dumb, and\ndepsite our best efforts, he\u2019s still\nthe boss. Not especially surprising\nreally. Tell us which of these quotes\nisn\u2019t a real Bush-ism.\nA. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about AIDS\ninside our White House. Make no\nmistake about that.\u201d\nB. \u201cWhen we consider the future\nof our nation\u2019s libraries... we must\nremember the lessons of September\n11th.\u201d\nC. \u201cI believe that, as quickly as\npossible, young cows ought to be\nallowed to go across our border.\u201d\n4. In Goonies Never Say Die we\nasked you to match the Goonies\nquote to the character. We don\u2019t\nwant to repeat ourselves though.\nThis time, tell us which of these\nquotes isn\u2019t from a legendary eighties film (and is from some poncey\nbollocks instead).\nA. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why. I think you\u2019re\na lonely person. I drive by this place\na lot and I see you here. I see a lot\nof people around you. And I see all\nthese phones and all this stuff on\nyour desk. It means nothing.\u201d\nB. \u201cUnbelievable, that old Biff\ncould have chosen that particular\ndate. It could mean that, that point\nin time inherently contains some\nsort of cosmic significance... On the\nother hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence.\u201d\nC. \u201cAnd then there was your\nboobs we did. Now, your boobs were\nMinnie and Mickey, I remember\nthat because of Disneyworld. And\nFelix! Felix is what we called your...\n*meow*.\u201d\n5. In issue 1305 we asked you wether\na celebrity was Dead or Alive. It\u2019s\nthe same again this time around.\n6. It\u2019s the General Election in a matter of weeks, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come\nup with something really satirical\nand witty nearer the time. Until then\nwe\u2019ll do what we did before, The\nBlair Film Project. Tell us what\nfilm Blair has managed to squeeze\nhis way into.\n7. Foot In Mouth was a quote quiz,\nwhere you had to match the bullshit said to the celebrity bullshitter.\nHere\u2019s a quote, who said it?\n\u201cInstead of getting married again,\nI\u2019m going to find a woman I don\u2019t like\nand just give her a house.\u201d\n8.Wetookthepissoutoftheover-paid\nprima-donnas of the Premiership\nwith Ugly XI. Here\u2019s another ming-ing footballer. Tell us who it is.\n9. For International Beats we\ntranslated a song into a foreign language and then back again, creating\na hideous shitty version, like a Joss\nStone cover if you like. Tell us the\nartist and the title of this song:\n\u201cNot more long frightened of the\ndarkness\nNeither the noon darkens anything\nNothing so ridiculously adolescent\nand desperate\nSo childish\nIn a better slower rhythm\nAnd more calculated\nNo opportunity of the escape.\u201d\n10. When we did Coffee Break\nCryptograms we didn\u2019t think anyone would like it, seeing as though\nwe just got it off the web (though\nnot the first page of Google, we\u2019re\nfar too cunning for that). Here\u2019s a\ncryptogram for you. Tell us what it\nmeans.\n11. Baby pictures of famous people\nwas the idea behind Hollywood\u2019s\nFinest. Here\u2019s another baby, tell us\nwho he/she/it grew up into.\n12. At Christmas we did a couple of\nthings, the big one being our SuperMega-Ultimate Xmas Lyrics Quiz,\na true test of festive spirit. What\nsong is this?\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s been so long\nBut I will be there\nTo sing this song\nTo pass the time away\nDriving in my car.\u201d\n13. Our other Christmas thing was\nGood Year / Bad Year, our very\nbrief quiz on 2004. Here\u2019s an even\nbriefer quiz on 2005:\nThe Huygens probe landed on\nSaturn\u2019s moon Titan this year, but\nhow many moons does Saturn\nhave?\n14. The first issue of the year brought\nDouble Vision, a chance for us to\nfiddle around badly with Photoshop,\na task with which we succeeded\nspectacularly. Here\u2019s a mix of two\ncelebrities, just tell us which two:\n15. The Movie Quote Quiz does\nexactly what it says it does. However\nseeing as though it\u2019s the last issue,\nand it\u2019s far too easy to Imdb straight\nquotes, we\u2019re gonna mix it up a little.\nLike question nine, it\u2019s going into\nanother language and back again.\n\u201cIt did not matter. Did not it signify anything. When I was broken,\nI would leave and would steal some\nmore. We ran all. We settle police\nofficers. We settle lawyers. We settle\nthe judges... all was for the to take.\nAnd now it is all over.\u201d\n16. Odd Ones Out was a bunch of\nrandom sets, and you just had to\ntell us which didn\u2019t belong. Same\nthing this time too \u2013 which is the odd\none out here, and more importantly,\nwhy?\nHere are Bert, Mustafa (looking\nrather fetching in his pink shirt),\nHe-Man and Chuck Norris.\n17. Beat The Intro was another\nlyrics quiz, however, it\u2019s far too easy\nto just Google these things. This\ntime you have to complete the song,\nwhich has an Imperial theme.\n\u2018Oh RSM...\n18. Here\u2019s a Close-Up of an album\ncover, you just tell us the artist and\ntitle please.\n\n"

    "content": "Apathy. It could be the greatest threat to humans yet.\nChanges in climate could lead\nto outbreaks of malaria, water\nshortages and flash floods.\nSkin cancer might even cause\n5000 more deaths a year. So\nwhy are we more passionate\nabout foxhunting?\nThat was a question raised\nduring the Royal Society of\nArts (RSA) debate on climate\nchange earlier last month.\nThe debate questioned\nwhether climate change really is one of the most pressing\nthreats ever to mankind.\nGuest speakers included\nMichael Grubb, Professor\nof Climate Change and\nEnergy Policy at Imperial\nCollege, Stephen Tindale of\nGreenpeace UK, BP\u2019s environmental advisor Chris\nMottershead and Vijay\nVaitheeswaran of the The\nEconomist. And, like the\nBritish Government has\nbegun to agree, they believe\nthat we\u2019re in a lot of trouble.\nBeginning the debate,\nStephen Tindale commented\nthat \u201cnot a single paper challenges that climate change\nis happening\u201d. Assuming a\nlinear increase in global\nwarming is in store for us,\nhe believes that one in three\npeople will suffer in the next\ncentury unless we act now.\nBut neither the root of climate change nor the changes\nwe face are completely clear.\nStudies reveal that global warming is happening,\nbut not how, said Professor\nGrubb. \u201cThe science behind\ntheIntergovernmentalPanel\non Climate Change [IPCC]\nstops at the end of this cen-tury, so it\u2019s difficult to know\nhow things will proceed\u201d he\nsaid. That places a big question mark over how to tackle\nboth the change in climate\nand the consequences.\nHowever, Vijay Vaitheeswaran believes that \u201cbecause\ncarbon dioxide stays in the air\nfor about a century, we should\nnow be concentrating on preparing future generations\u201d as\nwell as reducing emissions.\nHe also believes that Europe\nalone can\u2019t solve the problem of climate change and\nthat people need to act on an\ninternational level. The Kyoto\nagreement that came into\naction on 16 February hopes\nto do just that.\nYet there are sceptics of climate change who argue that\nhumans are not to blame for\nglobal warming. They shine\nthe torch of responsibility at\nsolar cycles and the changing\nfrequency of volcanic erup-tions. However, findings last\nweek, that the past 40 years of\nocean warming can be linked\nto the industrial release of\ncarbon dioxide, might change\ntheir minds.\nAmong the impending dis-asters, we are also told of the\nnumber of appealing possibil-ities. Tales of grapes growing\nin Southern England, hotter\nsummers and warmer winters are just a few examples.\nThe climate section of the\nBBC website even says that\nby 2060 the south of England\ncould experience weather\nlike that of the Loire Valley,\nin France. All this amounts\nto a confusing message for\nthe public, and some may be\nseduced by the idea. It might\neven explain some of the\nUK\u2019s indifference to climate\nchange.\nMuch like climate change\nitself, apathy towards it is\nglobal too. Despite 51% of\nAmericans expressing concern about global warming,\nan annual poll in the US found\nthat a large number of people\nconsidered it \u2018a bit of a yawn\u2019.\nBut the poll\u2019s results are\nno surprise really. It is well\nknown that the US churns\nout a huge percentage of the\nworld\u2019s industrial greenhouse\ngases and still doesn\u2019t consider carbon dioxide a pollutant.\nProfessor Grubb made it\nclear at the RSA conference\nthat the US even has the highest total carbon emissions,\nas well as the highest per\ncapita. \u201cCountries like the US\nwho are powerful and have\nthe greatest emissions are a\ngreat threat,\u201d he believes.\nCanada, Australia and New\nZealand as well as the UK\nare such countries and hang\nclose to the heels of the US.\nInterestingly, Grubb\u2019s results\nshowed India and China, with\ntheir massive populations, far\nlower down the carbon emissions scale.\nIronically, the US refuses\nto ratify the Kyoto agreement\nbecause of a \u201clack of restrictions on emissions by emerging economies China and\nIndia\u201d said The Japan Times\n(17 February 2005). Yet these\nare the countries to which the\nWest voices their authority.\nThey often argue that such\npopulations do little to combat climate change.\nDuring the RSA conference,\nVijay Vaitheeswaran stated\nthat \u201cdeveloping countries\nresent being told to reduce\nemissions by rich countries\nwho have become prosperous\nthrough polluting. They often\nask: \u2018why should we slow our\neconomy for you?\u2019\u201d\nA valid point. So how do\nwe reach a compromise?\nAccording to the majority of\nthe panel, the answer lies\nwithin well-coordinated communication between politicians of all countries. It also\nrequires establishing a trend\nthrough setting an example.\n\u201cIf Europe doesn\u2019t break with\nits efforts, it\u2019s a more hopeful\nsituation with the US,\u201d said\nProfessor Grubb. This option\nalso relies on businesses taking more action.\nHowever,ChrisMottershead\nof BP trusts in the steps\nindustries are already taking.\n\u201cGovernments and industries\nare tackling climate change,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cbut we should be\nconcentrating on implementing technology within companies to reduce carbon emissions.\u201d\nThe Carbon Trust is less\nconvinced and is running a\ncampaign to enthuse businesses to get a move on.\nIn DEFRA magazine, Tom\nDelay, Chief Executive of the\ntrust, says: \u201cSome UK businesses have chosen to act\nalready \u2013 but more need to do\nso. Businesses need to understand that there is a real commercial benefit to be gained\u201d.\nHe also believes that \u201cas\npublic concern about climate\nchange grows, businesses\nwill naturally become more\ninterested in and committed\nto cutting their carbon emissions\u201d.\nSo what will it take to\ngenerate public concern?\nFictionalising natural disasters such as The Day After\nTomorrow and Twister\nappear only to boost box\noffice earnings, and experts\npour scorn on the science\nbehind them.\nThe British Government\nappears to be taking the\nissue more seriously now.\nWith energy suppliers and\nthe Energy Saving Trust, it\nhas just launched a \u00a33m campaign to address feelings of\napathy in households tackling\nclimate change.\nOur concern should be\ngrowing. But if we need evidence on our doorstep, then\nthe predictions state we need\nonly wait a decade or two.\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nGlobal warming: does anyone care?\nThe evidence is there, the scientists are in agreement, but still the public remains sceptical.\nCato Hoeben reports on an expert discussion of public apathy towards global warming\n\u201cDespite 51%\nof Americans\nexpressing concern\n...a large number\nconsidered it \u2018a bit\nof a yawn\u2019\u201d\nI, science A science magazine for Imperial College Out Monday 14 March\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\n4\nWhat can I do?

    "content": "By Richard Kirk and\nAtul Rana\nAfter a season of continuously being dicked on, the\nalmighty deIViants started\nwinning matches and we\nwant to share the goodness\nwith everyone. So here are\nour victorious tales of deIVi-ancy.\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nSt Bart\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nWe set out to Stepney Green\nwith a thirst for revenge as\nmemories of our last disastrous encounter were still\nfresh.\nThe match started off with\nfrosty snow falling on the pitch\non a chillingly cold afternoon.\nThe first half was uneventful,\nbut the game soon livened up\nin the second with credit due\nto Zaidi and James.\nQuite frankly, Zaidi rocks\non pitch for us. Supported\nby a few ringers (mentioning\nno names, Andreas, Rich F,\nCharlie and Andrew) in mid-field, we showed that we are\na force to be reckoned with,\nso when James put the first\ngoal in from a sharp strike,\nwe were in for the kill.\nAs for St Bart\u2019s, they were\ngood, but not good enough.\nAzlan quickly picked out\ntheir star player, giving Tim\nand Tom the chance to force\nmany attacks. Continued\npressure pushed us further\nahead with a goal from James\n\u2018Charlie\u2019 \u2018Will I ever live up\nto my brother\u2019s reputation\u2019\nEdge.\nThe defensive fort was\nbeing held tight by Rich,\nAndrew and Atul, who spoiled\nany attacks. Not all credit can\nbe given to them though, as\nwe still have Doug, our wicket\nkeeper/goalkeeping star who\nonce again denied others the\nsatisfaction of calling him\n\u2018Dirty Sheets\u2019, wiping up any\nchances that St Bart\u2019s may\nhave had. We must also mention a notable performance\nfrom Ray in midfield, who is\nproving to be once of the most\nsuccessful freshers ever to\ngrace DeIViant ranks.\nIt is always good to have\nsuch a victory, however this\nweek\u2019s result was particularly\nsweet as after our last meeting we went away robbed 3-3\nafter a last minute goal from\na penalty corner.\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 4\nGKT Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nThis was a monumental event\nin deIViant history, as we\nmade friends with the opposition\u2019s ladies\u2019 team (or so\nwe\u2019d like to think). But back\nto the point, we won our first\nBUSA match ever. No doubt\nthese winning memories will\nbe glorified in the hazy mists\nof beer in the future!\nStruggling to get a squad\nin at the start of the match,\nthe deIViants were helped by\nlady luck when the fifth team\nmatch was abandoned. From\na feeble seven players, we\nnow had a magnificent 13.\nThe game began at a shockingly slow pace, so much so\nthat captain Kirk retreated\nback from his experimental\nmidfield position to defence\nto chill with the gang at the\nback. Fortunately James,\nAndreas and JonnyQ showed\ntheir dominance in mid-field, keeping GKT in their\nplace. Their best chance only\noccurred when captain Kirk\nshot at his own net, trying to\nchip our \u2019keeper Doug!\nAndreas then quickly\nsaw GKT\u2019s weak spots and\nrammed two goals in. But\neven with our 2-0 lead we\nwere not happy. JonnyQ\nreminded us of recent draws\nfollowing from leading positions in his motivational half\ntime team talk. This talk must\nhave worked, as in the second half we were much more\naggressive with Manish, Atul\nand Ray making some fine\nchallenges to prevent their\nattacks reaching our D.\nThe hero of this half was\nAndreas again. With another\ntwo goals, he thrusted us into\nthe lead. It must be noted that\nCharlie faced GKT\u2019s number\n10 with passion resulting in\nthreats from the GKT nutter\nsuch as \u201cI will break your\nlegs\u201d and \u201cI will eat you\nalive\u201d before the said opposition player decided that\nstealing our beloved Charlie\u2019s\nstick and throwing it off the\npitch would be best plan of\naction. The official umpire,\nmeanwhile, was probably\ndaydreaming.\nThe game ended with a barrage of short corners against\nGKT. Sadly these were all\ndirected at Tim, who felt that\nhe could do a far better job\nthan the rest of us and then\nsingle-handedly managed\nto miss three short corner\nopportunities in a row.\nWe then spent a few hours\nin the pub with GKT, where\nwe successfully smashed\npin glasses, both insulted\nand impressed GKT ladies,\nand even learnt a few drinking songs from their ladies\u2019\nsquad to add to our repertoire\nof deIViant tunes. Notable\npoints of the post-match celebrations involved Tim downing four shots of gin when\nLauren asked him (funnily he\nnever drinks with us for some\nreason), Ray and Andrew\u2019s\n\u2018pint through socks\u2019 and\nDoug\u2019s party piece fineage\nwhile drinking six shots of\ngin. He also deIViantly managed to lose control of his pint\nand smash it on the floor.\nHappy with our first BUSA\nwin and overall five points in\nour first year in the BUSA\nleagues, the fourths have finished the year in style and\nthe chant \u201cIC IVths walk on\nwater\u201d was sung out again to\nlift those deIViant spirits up.\nHOCKEY\nDeIViants start a winning streak\nImperial Medicals\nMen\u2019s 1st 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 2nd 4\nAfter relegation in BUSA,\nthe inquest into what went\nwrong concluded that our\n(Imperial Seconds\u2019) mistake\nwas leaving Will in charge.\nEven though he was only in\ncharge for one game, the boy\nmanaged to relegate us, but\nnot content with that he also\nhad to personally score the\nscreamer of an own goal that\nsank us. Special Will, very\nspecial.\nWith the bizarre events\nof this season\u2019s BUSA fixtures behind us, Team\nBouncebackabilty needed\nto rapidly accumulate some\npoints in the last few games\nin the ULU league to avoid the\ndrop in both competitions.\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to get\nthe boys up for this game,\nour opponents were medics.\nAnd not just any medics, they\nwere our own medic first\nteam who were also firmly\nlodged in the southern hemisphere of ULU Premier 1. So\na six-pointer and a bit of old\nschool rivalry to boot looked\nlike making for an interesting day.\nOur skipper got up that\nmorning went out for a fry-up\nin preparation for the game\nat his local greasy spoon, but\nwas kidnapped by the Links\nboys and was next seen waddling around Princes Gardens\nnaked! The rest of our merry\ngang managed to make it\nthough, and for once we had\nsubs and balls to warm up\nwith. It was all looking too\ngood to be true, but would it\nlast or would it all fall apart?\nWe started well with Kemo\nand Will looking solid at the\nback, when not practising\ntheir diving for future fixtures that is. With the midfield of Easter and Has doing\n\u2018exactly what it says on the\ntin\u2019 and Parrott and Benji\nlooking dangerous out wide,\nthe job of the resident mole in\nthe hole was taken by Hideki,\nleaving Pacman up front.\nSoon a free kick about 40\nyards out on the right hand\nside was awarded. All the big\nguns/big headed folk went up,\nbut Easter had other ideas.\nAfter spending an entire\ntraining session taking free\nkicks from long range that\nweek and with a bit of a tail\nwind and the low sun in their\nkeeper\u2019s eyes, he decided to\nhave a pop... a poor decision\nthough, and the effort was\nfairly comfortably saved.\nWith a lot of our players out\nof position, the quick counter\ncould have caught us out, but\nEaster dealt with the clearance and put the considerable bulk of Greedy away down\nthe left wing. Greedy put over\na cross, the medic \u2019keeper got\na touch on it and it fell in the\nbox. First to react was Hideki,\nand a tricky ball was athletically volleyed in. A very cool\nfinish and just the start we\nwere looking for.\nWe didn\u2019t have to wait\nlong for the second either. A\nParrott run and shot down\nthe left had their \u2019keeper\nflapping again, resulting in\nanother loose ball in the box.\nAnd yes, up popped the mole\nfor his second, another good\nslot and we were flying.\nThere was very little traffic\ngoing in the other direction\nand it was evident that Clifton\nwas getting seriously bored in\ngoal. When he was called into\naction, the voices in his head\nwere definitely on song and\nthe red mist had descended,\nbut other than adding a little\nspice at the back, this was\npretty irrelevant that day.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the\nthird to come. Benji was away\ndown the right hand side and\nfinished emphatically for his\nfirst Imperial goal. Keep a\nclean sheet now and it\u2019d be a\ngood points haul for us all in\nour fantasy league. But wait,\nthat bloody pesky mole hadn\u2019t\nfinished yet and cunningly\ntook on the keeper, rounding\nhim with ease to tuck away\nhis third and our fourth.\nMeanwhile, AK had been on\nthe sidelines making a dramatic recovery from his four-month long injury. He suddenly declared himself fully\nfit and came on for the man of\nthe match Hideki.\nA great result put us nearly\ninto the safety of mid-table\nmediocrity. ICSM at the time\nof writing have a lowly one\npoint and are lying in the\ndrop spot. But ULU tables\nare never up to date so hopefully we will get a repeat of\nthis fixture next year as it\nalways makes for an interesting clash.\nFOOTBALL\nSeconds edge closer to ULU safety\nBy Ben Anstiss and\nClarice Chung\nTwo Head races over a single weekend, Saturday\nin Reading and Sunday in\nNottingham (BUSA), meant\na busy few days for Imperial\nCollege Boat Club. Reading\nwas an opportunity for the\n\u2018non-student\u2019 Senior 8+\n(made up of graduates and\na few ex-IC rowers), the second \u2018student\u2019 Senior 8+ and\nthe Novice men and women\nto show what they\u2019re made\nof before the massive Head\nof the River Races on the\nThames this month.\nThe Novice girls and the\nstudent Senior 8+ competed\nin the morning division. The\ngirls made a vast improvement on their performance\nin Peterborough to come second in their division (far, far\nbetter than last!) just behind\nthe Reading crew. They have\nreally worked hard these past\nweeks to improve dramatically as a crew and should\nbe commended for the effort\nthey and their coaches (Foxy\nin particular) have all put in.\nThe non-student Senior 8+\nand the Novice men competed\nin the afternoon division. The\nnovice crew decided to boat\nextra-early to get a nice long\nwarm-up paddle before rac-ing. So early, in fact, that the\nsenior crew were nowhere to\nbe seen and their boat was\nstill on the trailer. As a testament to IC efficiency, when\nthe novices de-boated, the\nsenior guys were all standing round, their boat on the\ntrailer; they had managed to\narrive, rig their boat, race and\nde-rig in well under an hour.\nTherewereexcellentresults\nfor both boats, with the senior\ncrew coming 1st in the Senior\n1 category, 1st in the division and 3rd overall for the\nday, just behind Isis (Oxford)\nand Leander. Particularly\nwell done to Rich \u2018Hasselhoff\u2019\nHarrison who rowed so hard\nhe threw up 15 strokes from\nthe finish. The Novices won\ntheir category easily, placing\n10th in the division and 18th\noverall, 36 seconds behind\nthe senior boat! Their next\nrace is the Kingston Head\non 12 March, then the weekend after it\u2019s the Head of the\nRiver Race on the Thames\nfrom Chiswick to Putney.\nDetermined to carry\non from the success of the\nReading Head, a small group\nof rowers piled into our shiny\nnew minibus for the long tedious journey to Nottingham. It\nwas, in general, a relatively\nsuccessful day with IC boats\nbeing placed in the top 3 for\nevery race they entered.\nThe men\u2019s coxed four of\nOli, Rich, Iain, Big Ginger\nHenry and little Ali won their\nevent easily. Our top men\u2019s\neight came up against their\nold rivals Oxford Brookes\nin a bid for the headship.\nUnfortunately for them,\nBrookes were rather stacked\nwith GB rowers who\u2019d just\ncomebackfromtrainingcamp\nin Seville. And being Brookes\nboys, they spend their entire\nlives rowing and pretending\nto do \u2018degrees\u2019 in tourism or\nhotel management.\nThe women performed well,\ndespite a major disadvantage.\nWhilst all the other crews\nparaded their incy-wincy\nchild-like coxes, they were\nstuck with me \u2013 rather too tall\nand definitely far too heavy to\ncox. To top it all off, I\u2019d forgotten my lifejacket and CoxBox\n(the magic box that tells me\nhow fast we\u2019re rowing and\nconnects my microphone to\nthe speakers so that the rowers can hear me). Oops...\nThe coxed four came joint\nfirst with Cambridge, even\nafter a ten second penalty\nfor use of foul language. The\ncoxless four brought home\nbronze medals, despite having never rowed together\nbefore. The eight raced well,\novertaking both Brookes and\nLoughborough along the way.\nThe race officials had repeatedly told us that we\u2019d won\nthe Championship Eights,\nbut at the medal presentation we were suddenly told\nwe\u2019d got silver. They\u2019d made\na typo, apparently, that took\n10 seconds off our time. How\nconvenient that Nottingham\nshould win (narrowly) on\nhome ground! Never mind,\nwe\u2019ll open up a can of whoo-pass on them at the Women\u2019s\nHead, revenge will be sweet!\nROWING\nWinning wet weekend for Boat Club\nSPORT sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\n34\n\n"

The hospital\u2019s\nmain services would transfer\nto the Hammersmith hospital\nin Acton, but no-one knows\nwhat the future will hold for\nImperial College teaching at\nthe site.\nAccording to an article in\nThe Observer, \u201cconsultants\nat both hospitals were told of\nthe plans last week, but were\nwarned by their chief executive that it would be officially\ndenied if the plans emerged\nin the run-up to [general\nelection] polling day\u201d.

The young,\nfemale and ethnic minorities were hardest hit my the\nrecent economic depression\nwith unemployment rates rising to 80-90% in some Roma\ngypsy communities. It is\nfeared by many that Bulgaria\nruns the risk of losing the\nnew generation to a lack of\neducational opportunities\nand a breakdown of the traditional social support network\nwithout replacement with the\nnew.\nWhile laying to waste much\nof the original state welfare,\nthe cultural transision necessitated to provide support for\norphansanddisabledchildren\notherwise has been slow. The\nadoption of orphans is a new\nphenonemon in Bulgaria,\nand in its early stages has\noften been exclusive of ethnic\nminorities and the physically\ndisabled.\nImperial College Aid to the\nBalkans (ICAB) is a new society that will organise volunteer placements to Bosnian\nand Bulgarian orphanages\nand children\u2019s homes starting this summer. Many of the\nproblems in these institutions\nstem from a lack of staff. We\nhope students from Imperial\ncan provide worthwhile support to the existing carers\nand help fill this gap during\ntheir stay.\nThere is of course a danger\nthat this charity will become\npart of a so called \u2018NGO syndrome\u2019. It is no exaggeration\nto say that often well mean-ing, but essentially ineffec-tive, western organisations\ndo little to help in the countries they operate in, and in\nsome cases get in the way\nand even exacerbate the\nproblems they are there to\nalleviate. We hope, however,\nthat ICAB will be able to offer\na valuable resource and will\nfill a demand for staff that\nplagues these institutions.\nOur overall aim is achievable\nand coherent: to provide a\nmemorable summer experience for some of the most\ndisadvantaged children in\nEurope.\nThe trips will be in groups\nof four and last a minimum\nof two weeks. Our sister\norganisation OXAB has been\nrunning similar projects for\nseveral years with much\nsuccess, and through these\nlinks we have already set up\nplacements for Imperial this\nsummer. ICAB is merely the\nmediator; it will be the student who decides when to\ngo, where they go and who to\ngo with. This is an opportunity to do something different\nthis summer, to learn about\nanother part of the world, and\nhelp out at some of the most\nunderstaffed institutions in\nthe two troubled countries.\nTo find out more about the\nBalkans and ICAB, please\ncome to one of our meetings:\non Thursday 10 March (today)\nat Charing Cross Seminar\nroom B1 (basement of the\nReynolds), or on Tuesday 15\nMarch at South Kensington\nCampus, SAFB room 121\nopposite lecture theatre 1.\nYou can also visit our website,\nwww.icab.org.uk.\nWant to do something different this summer?\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nAID TO THE BALKANS\nFor those of you who don\u2019t\nknow, the students\u2019 union has\na gem of a club housed in the\nbasement of the Southside\nBuilding, off Exhibition Road.\nYes, it\u2019s a Free Weights\nClub focused on general fitness and specific sporting fitness needs. It\u2019s not exactly\nfree, but it is cheap and it has\na great range of high quality equipment. The term \u2018free\nweight\u2019 is used because we\nhave barbells and dumbbells\nwhich are used while exercising without the direct control\nafforded by the arms or levers\nof a machine.\nFormed in the late 1980s, the\nclub has grown significantly\nto have around 250 members\neach year for the past few\nyears. In the past five years\naround \u00a325,000 of members\u2019\nfunds has been invested in\nupgrading the equipment to a\nhigh standard.\nIsn\u2019t free weights just for\nbodybuilders and Olympic\nweightlifters, I hear you ask?\nOf course bodybuilders use\nfree weights just as they use\nmachines. However, your free\nweights gym is not focused\non being a bodybuilding\nclub. Certainly, people can\nbuild their body mass in the\ngym, but the focus is on general fitness and supplementing sports fitness training\nthrough lifting weights. The\naim is improved strength,\npower and endurance.\nFree weight training is a\npreferred means of developing elements of specific fitness for many sports. For\nexample, to be considered\nfor the elite squad of English\nrugby, you must be an effective user of free weights able\nto do lifts such as the clean\nand the snatch.\nThe Free Weights Club\nenjoys the membership of\nsportspeople from a variety of clubs including bad-minton, water polo, martial\narts, rowing, rugby and foot-ball. Importantly it also has\na strong contingent of non-sports club members, many\nof whom are members of\nother clubs and societies.\nWe have around 80 square\nmetres of floor space, including zones for bench press,\nsquats,freeweightbarbelland\ndumbbell exercises as well as\na number of free weight and\nfixed weight machines for\nspecific muscle group work-outs. Warming up, there is a\nbicycle and there are mats for\nstretching.\nThe club has two qualified\ninstructors but in addition has\nrecently enlisted the services\nof a well-known advocate of\nfree weights. Linford Christie\nhas competed and won at the\nhighest level in his sport. He\nwon Olympic gold in the 100\nmetres in Barcelona in 1992 in\naddition to world and national\ntitles. Free weights have been\nan integral part of his training\nprogramme for over 25 years.\nWe asked Linford what he\nsaw as the benefits of using\nfree weights. He told us that\n\u201cfree weights challenges you\nto ensure you get your technique right so you can apply\nmaximum effort (both physical and mental) so you can\nkeep on improving your performance\u201d.\nElaborating, he said:\n\u201cWhen you do free weights\nit is important to make sure\nyou use each muscle group\neffectively. For each exercise\nyou need to know what are\nthe prime or secondary movement muscles and what are\nthe stabilising muscles. You\nneed to know the right way\nto push or lower a weight. If\nyou do this and get your technique right you can then face\nthe mental challenge of lifting\nthe weights according to the\nprogramme you are working\nto and aim at improvements\u201d\nAnything else? \u201cYes, when\nyou are competing or training\nfor your sport it\u2019s very rare\nthat your muscles work in iso-lation. When you use most\nmachines you are typically\nisolating a muscle group or a\nfew muscle groups. When you\nuse free weights, all muscle\ngroups are in use, whether as\nprime or secondary movers\nor indeed as stabilisers. That\nis a key reason why sports\npeople have a preference for\nfree weights\u201d.\nIn respect of machines versus free weights, Linford com-mented: \u201cI do use machines\nfrom time to time and you\nhave some here. They are\nwithout doubt useful and have\ntheir place. However, you just\ndon\u2019t face the same challenge\nwith lifts such as the free\nweight bench press and free\nweight squat\u201d.\nMmm, but isn\u2019t there a danger you might lift too much\nand get injured? \u201cWell no,\nthat\u2019s where common sense\nand experience come into\nplay. You should lift with good\ntechnique and according to\nyour capability and not that\nof others. For some of these\nexercises, like the bench\npress, you should have a\nspotter or helper present in\ncase you feel you need some\nhelp. If you are working to a\nprogramme you shouldn\u2019t be\ngoing overboard anyway. By\nall means aspire to do what\nothers have achieved, but\ntake the necessary steps and\nprecautions in getting there.\u201d\nDo you think you would have\nachieved your goals without\nusing free weights? \u201cNo I\ndon\u2019t. Machines just cannot\ndo enough for you if you want\nto reach the pinnacle of your\nsport.\u201d\nIn which case, are they\njust for the elite? \u201cNo way.\nAll of the squad members\n(both male and female) I have\ntrained with over the years\nhave used free weights and\nso did my competition and\ntheir colleagues. I certainly\nsee the same in other sports.\nAnd of course in the gyms\nI have trained in over the\nyears I have seen lots of non-sportspeople use free weights\nto good effect. I have been\ninvited many times to give\nadvice to schoolkids who are\nencouraged and keen to use\nfree weights.\u201d\nWhy get involved with our\ngym? \u201cWell I do know some\nof the past and present members and I am doing quite a\nbit toward helping people in\ntheir endeavours. Although\nwe have an Olympic bid going\non, I value facilities like this\nand am keen to see people\nmake as much use of them as\npossible to help achieve their\ngoals \u2013 whether sporting or\njust general fitness. I did not\nhave a gym like this available\nto me when I first got going.\nIt\u2019s a great asset and I can\u2019t\nbelieve that the students only\npay \u00a325 a year to use it. The\nUnion has done well by its\nmembers\u201d.\nWhether you just want to\nimprove your fitness or are\nseeking to achieve your goal\nof sports stardom, your Free\nWeights Club will be delighted\nto see you. Visit us in the\nbasement of the Southside\nBuilding or contact our club\nsecretary for more information about joining and using\nthe facilities.\nChristie backs Free Weights Club\nFREE WEIGHTS\nImperial Free Weights Club members with Olympic gold medallist Linford Christie\n\n"

    "content": "By Barnaby Adams\nHad any one heard of the Arts\nFest until a few weeks ago? I\ncertainly hadn\u2019t, but that outrageously pukish pink publicity campaign somehow managed to get over 250 people to\nattend the variety show that\nwas the Arts Fest 2005 Finale\nConcert.\nAs well as more traditionally \u2018artsy\u2019 items such as performances by Imperial Brass,\nSinfonietta and IC String\nEnsemble, the Finale Concert\nshowcased everything from\ndance to martial arts.\nThe highlight for me was\nthe capoeira demonstration.\nI\u2019m not sure anyone in the\naudience had ever seen or\nheard of the Brazilian martial\nart before. Everyone seemed\nenthralledbytheuniquefusion\nof South American music, self\ndefence and dance. There\nwere certainly a few worried\nlooks and gasps from the\ncrowd when the Capoeiristas\nstarted bashing their swords\ntogether... I\u2019m not sure the\nUnion steward standing next\nto me, shifting in his boots,\nenjoyed it so much.\nWith entertaining, and at\ntimes off the wall, commentary from the evening\u2019s hosts,\nAlyona Andreicheva and\nNeville Tam (both dressed to\nthe nines), the show was a\ngreat demonstration of the\nrange and quality of performing arts at Imperial College.\nA special mention should go\nto Lara West, a dancer with\nDance Company who broke\nher foot in their last piece\nbut carried on valiantly to the\nend. Her dedication is admi-rable!\nThe Arts Fest 2005 week\nopened on the Monday with\na \u201cfolding session\u201d in the\nJCR at lunchtime by Origami\nSociety, which was followed\nin the evening by a Chamber\nMusic Concert. Although the\nattendance was reasonable,\nthe high standard of ensembles deserved a bigger audi-ence.\nThe Jazz and Rock gig\nnight featured sets from four\nbands playing music ranging\nfrom ska to blues rock. At the\nnight\u2019s peak, White Elephant\nwere performing to an appreciative audience of over 130\npeople. My personal highlight was the ska band Circus\nPenguin, who I thought were\nworthy of a later slot.\nThe Dance Extravaganza\non Wednesday afternoon had\na disappointing attendance,\nperhaps due to the business\nof sporting activities, but I\nguess not many people knew\nwhat exactly to expect from\nsuch a vaguely branded event.\nThe 30 or so who did turn\nup had more than a pleasant\nsurprise, finding free introductory lessons in capoeira,\nbreakdancing, hip-hop, contemporary dance, latin and\nsalsa which ran all afternoon\n\u2013 it should have been named\nthe Dance Marathon.\nLater that day, over 150\ncharitable souls attended the\nTsunami Appeal Concert featuring Symphony Orchestra,\nChoir and Big Band.\nConsidering that the event\nwas free, with voluntary donations only, the total of over\n\u00a3450 was astounding and was\ntestament to the generosity of\nImperial students and staff.\nJazz Big Band as usual\npulled in the crowds and\nperformed their \u2018Atomic Big\nBand\u2019 show to a packed dBs.\nIt\u2019s a pity that the Union isn\u2019t\nalways this bustling, as a fant-abulous night was had by all.\nMuch overlooked, but\nnot forgotten, was the Art\nExhibitionintheBlythGallery.\nNot only was I impressed by\nthe quality, but also the imagination evident in the works\ndisplayed, all of which were\nby Imperial students.\nIn summary, I felt that Arts\nFest 2005 was a week of high\nquality, fun and free events\nwhich perhaps deserved\nmore notice.\nIt remains to be seen whether Arts Fest 2005 will be successful in getting more people\ninterested in artistic pursuits,\nas was its aim. Certainly the\nattendance was improved at\nthe established events such\nas Jazz & Rock and Big Band\ngigs, but the uptake on some\nof the new events such as the\nDance Extravaganza was less\nimpressive. Was it because it\nwas all branded as \u2018Arts Fest\u2019,\nwhich certainly made some\npassers-by refuse flyers without a second glance at what\nfree events were on offer?\nRegardless, I am looking\nforwards to what Arts Fest\n2006 might have in store.\nAll new Arts Fest ends on a high\nARTS FEST 2005\n16 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk\nTop to bottom: Jazz and Rock gig night in dBs; Capoeira free lesson during the Dance Extravaganza; Dance Company free lesson\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 10 March 2005\nMUSIC music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s grim oop North\nNewcastle\u2019s finest and Warp\u2019s latest signing, Maximo Park, chat to Felix\nabout their accents, pop, and the red book\n21\nINTERVIEW\nOK, Lord Of The Rings mania has\ngone too far when they let the hobbits form a band. Cheap shot at the\ncertainly eccentric looking Young\nKnives who take to the stage to an\nalready large crowd. Hailing from\nOxford (shirt and tie: check. Thick\nrimmed glasses: check. Boring monologues between songs: check), they\nmake a curiously angular new-wave\nracket whilst looking like accountants being electrocuted. Yelpy,\ndischordant and not bad at all.\nBut the sold-out crowd at London\u2019s\ntrendy Infinity club in Mayfair aren\u2019t\nhere to see some socially retarded\nmidgets, oh no. They\u2019ve come to see\nthe on-the-up northerners known\nas Maximo Park. Having to force\ntheir way to the stage through the\ncrowd singer Paul announces \u201cWe\nare Maximo Park from Newcastleupon-Tyne\u201d before leaping in the\nair in perfect synchronicity to the\nmusic.\nAnd what music! It\u2019s somewhere\nbetween the tunefulness of Franz\nFerdinand, the mad choppiness\nof The Futureheads and the pop\nsensibilities of Pulp. Hearing the\nsongs sang in a heavy and melodic\nGeordie accent is a relief after so\nmany bands that hide their accents.\nThe crowd dances crazily and\necstatically (Probably helped by\nthe cheap cheap drinks), and loud\ncheers ensue for staples The Coast\nIs Always Changing and brilliant\nnext single Apply Some Pressure.\nThe band put on a good stage show\nas well, with guitar sparring between\nlead guitarist Duncan, and bassist Archis. Lukas, the keyboardist,\ndoes a strange foot-stopping karate-chopping dance whether he\u2019s playing or not, and Paul leaps around,\ndoes mad-eyed stares, and generally causes the sound-engineers\na headache by flinging his microphone around on a tiny stage, causing much humming feedback. At\none point he pulls a mysterious little\nred book from his suit-jacket (the\nband are all immaculately dressed)\nand seems to sing his lyrics from it\nfrantically.\nAfter a not too surprising encore\n(you\u2019d have to fight your way\nthrough the crowd to get away, so\nthey just hung around at the back of\nthe stage) they stuck around to DJ\nuntil 3am (Interpol, Coctau Twins,\nPhil Collins (!), the Batman theme)\nand talk to anyone who came their\nway (especially if they were ladies, of\nwhich there were plenty). I dragged\nPaul backstage for a chat.\nI saw you supporting The\nFutureheads a while back,\nand you both seem very proud\nto announce where you\u2019re\nfrom, and don\u2019t try and hide\nyour accents. This is often\nmissing from music, why do\nyou think this is?\nIt\u2019sstrangethatpeoplecaresomuch,\nand that people draw attention to it.\nIt seems the most straightforward\nand honest thing in the world to sing\nin my own accent. It\u2019s embarrassing\nto put on a fake accent. I wouldn\u2019t\nexpect you (I am a pansy southern-er) to put on earthy northern tones\njust to fit in. We want to appear to\nbe honest, there\u2019s a certain kind of\nband where you know that the music\nhas come from a central core of\ntheir person, which is the thing that\nmakes the music resonate. That\u2019s\nwhat we want to be, I can be happy\nthat we haven\u2019t tried to fool anybody,\nthat our music\u2019s pure.\nDo you write the lyrics?\nYeah, I write the words. I came into\nthe band a little after everyone else,\nthere were a few lyrics there already\nlike \u201cI\u2019ll do graffiti and you\u2019ll sing to\nme in French\u201d and I just changed\nthe clauses. Duncan and Archis\nsang before, and they swapped guitar and bass. That was how Maximo\nPark worked, and I\u2019d seen them in\nNewcastle a few times.\nYou\u2019re signed to Warp, which\ntends to be an electonica\nlabel, and I find it interesting that they\u2019re your record\ncompany...\nSo do I, and that\u2019s one of the reason\nthat we signed to them. We met with\na number of different companies,\nand the independent company that\nis Warp stood for the same things\nwe stood for; being creative, being\nindividual, trying to push things as\nfar as they can go. They weren\u2019t\nsaying, \u201cwe want you to be an indie\nband\u201d or anything, and the term\nindie doesn\u2019t really mean anything\nto me now. The word independent\ndoes, but that\u2019s not its meaning any\nmore.\nMany small bands get so fed\nup of record labels they split\nor form their own label...\nWell, that\u2019s kind of what we did ini-tially, set up \u201cBillingham Records\u201d,\nnamed after the town where I was\noriginally from. We put out 300 copies of our debut single on red vinyl,\nrecorded in a house in Newcastle\nwhere we used to rehearse. Duncan\nis a trained sound engineer and\nhe recorded it. We did everything\nourselves, the DIY ethic. That\u2019s how\nthey (Warp) found out about it, we\nput it in Rough Trade (famous independent record shop/label), put it in\nthe right places, and they picked up\non us and decided that they wanted\nto sign a band like us.\nA lot of bands don\u2019t publicise\nthemselves very well, but\nyou have made a really good\nstart. How does it feel to have\nsold out a few gigs already,\nand did you feel constricted\nby a small stage?\nThe whole of this tour\u2019s sold out\nnow, which is amazing. It just steps\nup every time, which is really heart-ening. I personally like playing\nlarger stages, but I also like the\natmosphere of smaller gigs. There is\nsomething that gets lost with larger\naudiences. It\u2019s the law of averages,\npeople will be there for different\nreasons. It\u2019s nice to play in a 200\ncapacity place with people who are\nobsessed with music. That\u2019s why we\nwrite songs, to try and reach people\nwho wouldn\u2019t normally listen to an\nedgy guitar band. That\u2019s why we try\nto be as poppy as possible.\nPeople often hate the idea of\nbeing \u2018pop\u2019. Why do you think\nthat is?\nPop to me just means a tradition, a\ntradition that you love and you hate.\nYou want to rally against the stuff\nyou hate, and the stuff you love does\nthis. Whether it\u2019s Aretha Franklin\nor Smokey Robinson singing these\nsoulful pop songs, or Liz Fraiser\nfrom the Coctau Twins gushing out\nthese beautiful choruses. It\u2019s working within constrictions, but we like\nto write pop songs with a verse and\na chorus, but breaking down the\nboundary as to what the chorus is\nand what the verse is. We just want\nto play around with that idea.\nDo you think that the recent\ninjection of intelligence into\na lot of music, such as Franz\nFerdinand or Bloc Party, is\nmaking pop more credible?\nI think that\u2019s true. We want to put an\nintelligent spin on things because\nnot do so would be alien to us. I think\npeople don\u2019t give the masses or the\npopulous enough credit. So much\nis sold to the public that is sub-standard, and because that\u2019s the\ntradition record companies think it\u2019s\nnot worth worrying about because\n\u201cpeople\u201d are stupid. I believe that\neveryone\u2019s got something in them\nthat means that they can connect\nwith another person. That\u2019s what we\ntry to do, we try to connect person\nto person via word of mouth, rather\nthan going \u201cthis is a big band, here\nis our single, you will like it because\nit is advertised well\u201d. We want to\nget into peoples faces, but then they\ncan make their own mind up, and\nthen hopefully they will be given\na better product. An independent\nrecord company is the same as a\nbig record company, it\u2019s trying to\nsell something, but it\u2019s trying to\nsell something that is beneficial and\ngood rather than something lame.\nI hit your message board\nand found rubbish questions\nlike \u201cwhat\u2019s your favourite\ncheese/lollipop?\u201d and \u201cis the\nred book a harking back to\nlove?\u201d\nIt kind of is! The reason that it first\nappeared is a double gesture really.\nI didn\u2019t know the words to the songs\nthat well, I couldn\u2019t remember what\nI\u2019d started, and the words to each\nverse are different. I wanted it there\nso I decided to make it a performance piece. You might as well use it\nas something entertaining. I\u2019m on a\nstage and people have paid to see\nthat, people don\u2019t want you to just\nstand there. The music deserves a\nbit more. It may be a bit too theatrical for some people, you\u2019ve got to\ncarve out your own individual way\nof dealing with things, and that\u2019s\nmy way of dealing with forgetful-ness! I used to have the lyrics inside\nthe book, and it\u2019s sometimes nice\nto reference things. Everyone goes\n\u201cthis is really good, you\u2019ve got to\nhear this\u201d, so why can\u2019t you do the\nsame with books? Why does \u201chigh\nculture\u201d have to be divorced from\n\u201cpop culture\u201d, I think everything\nshould be sitting next to each other.\nIt\u2019s a more expansive way to look at\nthe world.\nFinally, I had trouble in chatting to all of you in the venue\nbecause you were always\nsurrounded by ladies! Surely\nthis is a good thing?\nThe world is a big place, and everyone\u2019s got a chance! Duncan and\nTom (the drummer) both have girl-friends, but the rest of are just very\nlonely individuals... well I am, that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m the singer! There\u2019s no time\non the road for a relationship.\nUnless you get a girl in the\nband\u2026\nUnless\u2026[some careful considera-tion] I don\u2019t think there\u2019s room,\nwe\u2019ve already got five people, that\u2019s\nquite a large number.\nJames Millen\nMaximo Park\nInfinity\nHHHHI\nMaximo Park: often set upon by feral stripy ties\nDemo\nreviews:\nwe love\nnew music\nDEMO REVIEWS\nWith influences as diverse as Sylvia\nPlath, White Noize and Mowtown,\nthe inimitable Freezerburn are a\nforce to be reckoned with, meaning they can be forgiven for taking\nfrom everyone, and sounding like\nno one. Championed by the likes of\nIkara Colt, Miss Black America and\nStu Campbell of JJ72 and Lowgold\nfame, the Hampshire trio have made\na tentative foothold on their path to\nmusical glory, by the means of their\nbrief yet promising demo.\nTitle track Candela is the\nautumn rainy-day anthem we\u2019ve\nall been waiting for.

Finishing off with a crashing crescendo, Freezerburn entertain with a DIY foot-tapping charm\nthat doesn\u2019t fail to seduce. Into Your\nArms is a feistier, thoroughly ener-gising effort, with Kat\u2019s wailing being\na textured foil to the lead.

Numaan Chaudhry excogitates\nThe start of this week saw\nDeutsche Boerse AG, the\nprimary stock exchange\nin Germany, drop its proposed bid to pay \u00a31.3bn for\nthe London Stock Exchange\n(LSE) after continual shareholder opposition to Chief\nExecutive Werner Seifert\u2019s\nacquisition plan.\nDissident shareholders\nnow own between 50% to 60%\nof Deutsche Boerse\u2019s stock,\naccording to public statements from involved firms,\nprivate letters of opposition\nsent to Deutsche Boerse and\npeople familiar with the mat-ter.\nThe move to abandon the\nbid raises questions about the\nfuture of Mr Seifert, who has\nonce before tried, and indeed\nfailed, to buy the LSE in his\nlong-term drive to outpace\nthe European rival exchange\noperator Euronext and kickstart consolidation among\nEuropean stock exchanges.\nMr Seifert faces an arduous\ntask of repairing badly frayed\nrelations with a majority of\nshareholders of the German\nstock exchange operator as a\nresult of the bid.\nThe change in the bid\nmarked a stunning reversal,\nas Mr Seifert\u2019s talks to buy\nLSE have been public since\nlast December.\nNow Deutsche Boerse\u2019s\nexit leaves open the door for\nEuronext to buy the London\nexchange. However, unlike\nGerman law, both LSE and\nEuronext would have to seek\nshareholder approval for a\ntakeover or merger under,\nrespectively, UK and Dutch\nlaws.\nIn a statement on Monday\nevening, Deutsche Boerse\nsaid it reserves the right to\nreturn with a new offer if LSE\nis made an offer, from another\nexchange or otherwise.\nPressure on Mr Seifert had\nmounted. Some of the dissident shareholders had publicly said they are preparing\nan attempt to vote out the\ncompany\u2019s supervisory board\nat its annual shareholders\u2019\nmeeting, which is set for May.\nThe structure in Germany\nis slightly different as firms\nhave two boards: a supervisory board of mostly non-execu-tive directors and a management board of \u2018insider\u2019 direc-tors.\n\u201cWe strongly believe the\nmajority of shareholders are\npublicly and privately against\nthis deal and the company is\naware of this,\u201d was the opinion of a partner at TCI, a\nstakeholder of this deal. They\ncommented after Deutsche\nBoerse\u2019s decision as an indication as to what course of\naction the dissident shareholders might now take.\nMany dissident shareholders argued in recent days that\nacquiring LSE would have\ndestroyed shareholder value\nand that the company\u2019s cash\npile of more than 600m euros\nmight be better spent buying\nback its own shares and paying out higher dividends.\nSome dissidents said they\nhad no choice but to seek\nthe board\u2019s removal because\nDeutsche Boerse has refused\nto put its decision to acquire\nLSE to a shareholder vote.\nThe battle dividing\nDeutsche Boerse is the latest instance of hedge funds\nbuying up stakes in companies that are in the midst of\nacquisition bids in an attempt\nto influence the outcome of\na deal. In Deutsche Boerse\u2019s\ncase, however, the fight has\nspread to include other major\nand prestigious investors\nsuch as Fidelity Investments.\nThe clash showcases how\nEuropean shareholders are\nstarting to take a more active\nrole, something they have\nlagged behind US investors\nin doing.\nWhile the rebellion has\nbeen led by UK and US\nhedge funds, such as TCI and\nAtticus Capital, a number of\nsignificant institutional investors have joined rank, including Fidelity, Merrill Lynch\nInvestment Managers and\nGenerali Asset Management.\nIn addition to those heavyweight investors, two large\nUS institutions with big holdings in Deutsche Boerse signalled to management over\nthe weekend that they, too,\nopposed an LSE takeover.\nMr Seifert, along with\nDeutsche Boerse\u2019s supervi-sory-board chairman, Rolf\nBreuer, who is also chairman of Deutsche Bank AG,\nhad played down the threat\nposed by dissident sharehold-ers, arguing that a majority\nof shareholders supported\nan LSE acquisition, in recent\nweeks.\nBut support has been\nquite meagre, with just two\nbig shareholders, Union\nInvestment of Germany and\nState Street Global Advisors,\nstating their backing for an\nLSE bid.\nRecently, the rebels appear\nto have the momentum.\nDeutsche Boerse\u2019s shares\nlast week traded at volumes\ntwice the typical daily aver-age, the bulk of trades being\nconducted by hedge funds\nattempting to make gains by\nbetting that Mr Seifert would\nbe either forced out or back\ndown from an LSE bid, opening the door to share buy-backs that could boost the\nstock\u2019s value.\nUp for sale: the London Stock Exchange\n\n"

Hence, Alfred has\nnever known intimacy with a woman\nuntil he marries Clara McMillen\n(Laura Linney). Alfred is a biolo-gist, and being the scientist that he\nis, he believes that there is a scientific solution to every problem. Thus,\nafter a disastrous first night in bed,\nhe decides to meet up with a sex doctor to resolve their issues; a meeting\nthat spurns Alfred and Clara into a\njourney of sexual experimentation\nand discovery.\nMuch to Alfred\u2019s surprise, he discovers that other couples are similarly ignorant about sex (it is the\nyear 1948). Realising this astonishing dearth of clinical research and\nscientific data about sex, he sets\nhimself on a journey to understand\nit by stripping away the emotional\nentanglements. His research exposes not just the common heterosexual relationship, but also other\ncontroversial relationships such as\nbestiality and homosexuality. It also\nfavours polygamous relationships as\nthese apparently have the ability to\nspice up one\u2019s sex life.\nAlfred does not just view his find-ingsasaseparateaspectofhislife;he\napplies them to his marriage as well.\nThrough his research, he becomes\ninvolved in a homosexual relationship with his research colleague,\nClyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard). He\neven allows his wife, Clara, to engage\nin extra-marital sex. When his findings are first published, they are\nlikened to the explosion of an atom\nbomb by the press and Alfred is held\nin high regard by every American for\nhis expertise in sex.\nHowever, his fall from the throne\narrives when he decides to publish\nhis findings on the sexual behaviour\nof American women. His research\nis met with disgust, and he loses all\nfunding for his research. His wave\nof bad luck does not end there. The\nsexual utopia Alfred has created\nbetween his research mates and\ntheir wives crumbles to pieces when\nClyde\u2019s wife threatens to leave him\nfor another man. As a result, Alfred\nspirals into a pool of self-doubt and\ndepression.\nFrankly, Kinsey does not provoke\ntoday\u2019s audience as much as he\nmust have done in the fifties. The\ninternet has, without doubt, helped\nalert today\u2019s public to every imaginable and warped method there is to\nachievesexualsatisfaction.However,\nthe real shock behind Kinsey is the\nfact that homosexuality, bestiality\nand polygamy were practised in the\nfifties. Many have argued that these\nmethods are prevalent in the 21st\ncentury due to moral degradation\nin our society. However, the satanic tools accused of spreading this\nmoral degradation had not yet come\ninto existence in the fifties. Does it\nmean that these things, considered\nunnatural by many, are in fact, natural after all?\nThe cast list is one to be applaud-ed. Liam Neeson plays the role of an\nemotionally inadequate scientist to\nperfection. His control of his body\nlanguage and facial expressions is\na perfect manifestation of his acting\nskills. Peter Sarsgaard also gives a\nconvincing performance as a bisexual young man. However, Laura\nLinney needs to vary her facial\nexpressions to further strengthen\nher role as the supporting, unconventional wife of an eccentric.\nOne cannot watch Kinsey and not\nexpect any scenes of nudity. Kinsey\nis in fact littered with nudity and\nprovocative sex scenes. However,\nthese are done in an objective and\ntasteful manner which helps remind\nthe audience that it is purely a biopic\ndepicting the scientific findings of\nthe American sexual culture in the\npost-war years.\nOverall, Kinsey is a not a movie to\nbe taken lightly. It provokes one to\nquestion one\u2019s sexuality and one\u2019s\nidea of \u2018normal\u2019 sexuality. It might\neven prove offensive to some, but\nfor open-minded viewers who can\ntake it in their stride it is well worth\na watch. Nevertheless, watching\nthe eccentricities Mrs Kinsey has\nto endure puts all other relationship\nissues in their place. So, Mrs Kinsey,\nI salute you! Angela Yuen Lee\nLet\u2019s talk about sex\n\u201cSexual behaviour in the human male\u201d \u2013 Alfred Kinsey 1948\nKinsey\nDirector: Bill Condon\nStarring: Liam Neeson,Laura\nLinney,Chris O\u2019Donnell\nLength: 119 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHHHI\nA movie about sex. A ruler. You write the caption\n\u201cHomosexuality,\nbestiality and\npolygamy were all\npractised in the\nfifties\u201d\nFlying high\nDiscontented pilot Frank Towns\n(Dennis Quaid) and his co-pilot AJ\n(Tyrese Gibson) arrive on a plane\nin the Mongolian desert to pick up\na group of oil-digging people and\ntake them back home. So, after a\nfew arguments and angry looks,\nthe group eventually packs up and\ndeparts.\nThe audience gets to know each\ncharacter after a bit of friendly chat\nbetween the seated groups. As you\ncould very well guess, the plane ride\nisn\u2019t what you would call a smooth or\npleasant journey. A huge sandstorm\ncauses turbulence. Towns makes\nthe dumb decision to fly through,\nover and then around the storm.\nUltimately the plane starts falling to\npieces and crash lands.\nObviously the radio antenna is one\nof the pieces that falls off, causing no\ndistress signals to be sent out before\ncrashing. Though Towns endangers all their lives, no-one puts the\nblame on him as he flies through\nthe storm. Instead they thank him\nfor crashing.\nAfter realising they are in the middle of a huge desert and miles away\nfrom their original path, they realise no-one is going to find them.\nOne important comment that did\ncome up every single time was that\nnobody really cares about these people and nobody would actually be\nsearching for them. Rub it in, why\ndon\u2019t they?\nSo they have very little water and\neven less food and the hope of being\nrescued is quickly dwindling. After\na huge display of animal behaviour\nover water, Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi)\nbrings on the unexpected news of\nre-building the plane. Of course, they\nhave all the tools necessary and the\ndesign, according to Elliott, is per-fect. This plan, however, needed a\nlot of cooperation from every single\nperson. After firstly disbanding the\nidea, they give it a shot as it would\nbe something to do as opposed to\njust standing around.\nThe newly built plane is to be\nnamed Phoenix after a mythical bird\nthat is reborn from its own ashes,\nhence the name of the movie.\nI must admit that this was one\nof the better films that I\u2019ve seen\nfor some time. The audience is\nkept thrilled with the inclusion of\na marauding gang of black-clothed\nninja-looking bad people who use\nhumans as target practice.\nThis plot is not about history or\nheart-warming characteristics of\nthe human soul. It isn\u2019t a love story\nand you won\u2019t be impressed by the\nsolution to their problems either.\nThis is just a good old movie that\nwill get your heart pounding the\nold-fashioned way (remember what\nthat\u2019s like?) It\u2019s just plain exciting.\nIt\u2019s an extraordinary bit of film\nmaking. The questions are: can\nthey all work together? Can Elliott\u2019s\ndesign work? Will they get out before\nthe ninjas attack them?\nHowever, the main and most interesting question is: who is going to\ndie next? The pacing of the movie is\nbrisk and energetic and it has loads\nof spirit.\nAs for acting skills, Ribisi\u2019s high\nnasal voice is just hilarious and\ndeadly serious. Does this movie\nbring out the action-adventure-ness\nin it? Definitely!\nThe CGI is also pretty good and\nbelievable, though the sandstorm\ndid seem pretty as opposed to scary\nwith its mysterious shifting sand.\nSure, the movie is pretty predictable,\ndue to its lovely title, but it\u2019s great\nfun. It also had a great soundtrack\nthat couldn\u2019t have been any better.\nAll that can be said is, this flight is\ndefinitely one to be boarded!\nVidula Vinayagmoorthy\nFlight of the Phoenix\nDirector: John Moore\nStarring: Dennis Quaid, Giovanni\nRibisi, Miranda Otto\nLength: 113 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHHHI\nCrash landing onto a screen near you\nAs part of the release of Flight\nof the Phoenix, 20th Century\nFox have generously provided you with the opportunity\nto win t-shirts, a gift set (with\nwatch and swiss army knife),\nand \u2018sandwizards\u2019 (?)\nTo win, be one of the first to\nanswer this:\nIn the 1965 original The Flight\nof the Phoenix, which desert\ndid they crash into?\nEmail your answer to film.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk.

Stormy is\nhorny (again), and out on the prowl.\nThe object of last week\u2019s affection has revealed himself to be an\nuptight philistine, completely unable\nto cope with a couple of paranoia-inducing prank emails and dirty text\nmessages. He\u2019s got so angry over\nwhat, to me, is an exercise in jest,\nand is completely avoiding a good\nfriend of mine, who, to be fair, sent\nhim non-anonymous ego-flattering\nmessages, rather than insults. Alas.\nMy mother\u2019s test \u2013 making a guy\nangry, to see whether he\u2019d be violent\nor psychotic towards you \u2013 has been\nfailed miserably.\nThis, along with his non-existent\nerection and permanent beer gut,\nseem to come along with smoking\na small greenhouse-worth of wacky\nbaccy every week for the past four\nyears. Stoners are not for Stormy.\nIt\u2019s not just my mother who has\na test. There\u2019s my very own one,\nwhich determines whether a guy\nwill understand me or not. It\u2019s based\naround reactions to a very sick joke,\nwhich as a medic I really shouldn\u2019t\nbe laughing hysterically at. The only\nchap I\u2019ve ever had true feelings for\nlaughed at it for ages and saw the\nsardonic humour in such a dark\nimage.\nWhat\u2019s funnier than a dead baby?\nA dead baby in a clown suit.\nLet me know whether you find it\nfunny too. No, really. No-one likes a\nman who takes life too seriously!\nBlack humour aside, there\u2019s only\none thing I want you all to focus on.\nNo, not the comparative failure of\n\u2018Hospital Watch\u2019, which has yielded\none Orlando Bloom lookalike with\nhideous dress sense, adding more\namusement to the unexpected\nappearances by gangster Sikh from\ntime to time. I really don\u2019t understand how somebody could think\nthat promoting a fundamentalist\nagenda whilst quizzing a girl as to\nwhat she\u2019d like in a partner for the\nentirety of the date would endear\nhimself to her. Similarly, rolling up\nwith a list of profoundly worrying\ncharacter traits, including the need\nto carry weapons (the ceremonial\nSikh sword plus a pair of numchucks\nfrom his days as a \u2018professional witness\u2019 at a known Rudeboy hotspot),\nisn\u2019t a conventional aphrodisiac in\nany shape or form.

Conventional wisdom dictates\nthat women are drawn to capability,\nand thus power. However, the people\nwith the most to offer tend to be the\nmost silent on this matter, and by\nextension, the most single. Perhaps\nrelationships are for the more misguided amongst us.\nApologies for having to bitch about\nthe considerable boasting I\u2019ve had\nto put up with this week \u2013 the week\nthe medics are forced to think about\ntheir elective (studying abroad)\nplacements a whole fifteen months\naway. It\u2019s a shame that a placement\nin England is looked upon unfavour-ably, since we\u2019ve got the leading\nresearch institutes right upon our\ndoorstep. I could\u2019ve sworn the proposed IC-UCL merger would\u2019ve let\nus demolish the building midway\nbetween them, and take over the\nruins of Buckingham Palace with\nour new super-site. Alas, this is not\nto be, since a key academic involved\nin the merger plans is too busy\nfeasting his eyes amongst the current second year talent.\nI would consider heading over to\nUCL to check out the talent, but\nI\u2019ve never met a more vacuous set\nof good-looking guys in my life. Give\nme the talented and funny Imperial\nchap any day. Let\u2019s forgive him once\nmore for boasting since he\u2019s actually\nmade it so close to a girl (an experience which the current second year\nin physics are currently celebrating\ntheir Celtic friend with an unsettling\nAsian fetish for doing!)\nAnd it\u2019s on that note, I\u2019d like to\nleave you. It\u2019s the failures and mishaps that are the pillars of success.\nFrom gangster Sikh to the humour-less stoner, the only way is up!\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nMost of you know me as \u201cthe irritating guy in the back row that makes\nlots of noise during classes\u201d. But the\ntime has come for me to reveal my\ntrue identity: I am a social anthropologist researching at Imperial\nCollege.\nThe main objectives of this column are to analyse and interpret the\nbehaviour of people at IC in general.\nDay 1. The ratio\nOne of the reasons for the choice\nof Imperial College as my research\nenvironment is, obviously, the girl-boy ratio. Yes, I bet most of you\nhaven\u2019t realized, but we have an\nastonishing 65 guys for every 35\ngirls! How lucky are we?\nThe purpose of this week\u2019s article\nis to consider the following ques-tions:\n1. Why do we have only 35% girls?\n2. Where are those 35%?\n3. How do boys behave?\n4. Something else that I forgot now,\nbut I\u2019ll include when I remember it.\nHere\u2019s my attempt at answering\nthose questions.\n1. In case you haven\u2019t noticed,\nyou\u2019re studying at a so-called \u201ccollege of science, technology and medicine\u201d. So, what part of science and\ntechnology (let\u2019s forget medicine)\nhaven\u2019t you understood?\nLet\u2019s put this in an easier way for\nyou to analyse:\nGuys \u00f1 science + technology\n= abstract thinking \u2260 (paint-ing and colouring).(animals and\npeople).(decorating houses).(writing\nand reading) = humanities and arts\n\u00ef Girls\nSo, if you were a girl, would you\nprefer sciences to healing people\nor expressing yourself artistically?\n(If so, sorry, but you shouldn\u2019t be\nreading this article...)\nGirls, unless they are real geniuses or couldn\u2019t get into medicine\nor have some fetish for engineering,\ndon\u2019t come to Imperial. (Don\u2019t start\nsaying all that bollocks about equality and stuff, because we all know\nthis will continue to happen for at\nleast the next 30 years.)\n2. Well, 35% is quite a lot! I can\u2019t\nquite remember the last time I saw\nso many girls together (perhaps at\nthat party with South Kensington\nfirefighters\u2019 unit? Or maybe the\nChristmas I spent with the troops\nin Iraq...)\nBut why does it seem to me that\nthis college only has about 7.3% of\nfemales? I could be harsh and say\nit\u2019s because a big percentage of girls\nhere look like boys or because they\nnever leave their classrooms, but I\u2019ll\nleave this question open for you to\nthink about it.\n3. This really embarrassing ratio,\nthe lowest on Earth right after the\npercentage of girls working as taxi\ndrivers and postmen, can\u2019t only be\nthe girls\u2019 fault.\nIf we, guys, behave as we do (nerd-ing a bit here, nerding a bit there, not\nshaving, not putting in a minimum\neffort with dressing up, not having\nintelligent and sensible conversa-tions, getting drunk and throwing\nup all over Beit Quad), then the only\npeople we can blame for this miserable situation are ourselves.\nSo come on, start showering\nonce a week, buy a new secondhand set of clothes in Portobello\nMarket, start reading poetry and\nwatching flowers blossom, and you\nand I will see, in 3478925347825\nyears\u2019 time, great changes taking\nplace (perhaps, and let\u2019s be auda-cious, raising the ratio to 37.3% to\n62.7%). Let\u2019s do it!\n4. I still can\u2019t remember anything\nto put here, so I\u2019ll leave it for next\ntime (if they let me continue writing\nthis outrageous column!)\nPS. If you took this article too per-sonally, I would recommend that you\nget a life (you can start by buying a\nsense of humour!)\n\u25cf Comments? felix@ic.ac.uk\nAnalyse them\nby DIOGO GERALDES\n\n"

However I do have issues\nwith rabbits or other animals being\nbred and killed for the sole purpose\nof their skins being used to make\nsomeone look \u2018cool\u2019. It is not even\nas if the skins are a utilised byproduct of meat used by the hungry\nlocals in these countries, who are\nwithout a doubt earning less than\nour minimum wage to make these\nboots and clothes. There was also\nan example of fox fur being used\nas a fashion accessory in the Julien\nMacdonald show to launch London\nfashion week. I am sure it was not\nlong ago that supermodels and animal rights campaigners were united\nagainst the use of fur.\nAs is the case in science, when\nan opinion is formed it is often\nnot a one-sided argument. Should\nanimal fur be used in fashion? I\nown leather shoes; however these\ncows were not bred solely for their\nhide, their meat was used too. There\nare also the cases where I feel animal fur being used is a good thing.\nTake the example of the Australian\nbushtail possum (Trichosurus\nvulpecula), introduced into New\nZealand from Australia back in\n1858, which has since had a devastating impact on New Zealand\u2019s\nnative ground nesting birds, nearly\ndriving these species to extinction\n(a well-known example is the kiwi).\nA national possum eradication programme is underway, costing the\ncountry $50m annually. One way\nthat has been developed to help\nraise funds to cover this is the\nsale of possum fur products. Once\nkilled, possums are put through a\n\u2018possum plucker\u2019, removing their\nfur, which is then made into\njumpers, socks, gloves and nipple\nwarmers (yes that\u2019s right, nipple\nwarmers) to sell to locals and tourists alike.\nSilwood residents put forward\ntheir opinions on this, and although\nscientists are not renowned for\nbeing the most fashion conscious\nbunch, the results were interest-ing. With an even split of males and\nfemales taking part in a question-naire, more than two thirds of people disagreed with fur being used\nas a fashion accessory. The vast\nmajority did, however, agree that\nin cases such as the Australian\nbushtail possum, fur clothing is a\ngood way to raise funds for much\nneeded and financially restricted\nconservation.\nThe possum fur nipple warmers\ndid not go down so well, with only\none person admitting they would\nwear them.\nSpeaking out for Babar Ahmad...\nand for all of us\n\u201cAll it takes for evil to triumph is for\ngood people to do nothing\u201d\nEdmund Burke\nOn Wednesday and Thursday of\nlast week, Babar Ahmad faced the\nnext stage of his extradition hear-ing. Ultimately, the hearing was\nadjourned until April, giving time\nfor the prosecution to wind their\nway out of the latest brick wall they\nhave hit in their desperate efforts to\nextradite Babar. You can read about\nthe case and what happened inside\nthe court in more detail on pages 1\nand 2 of this newspaper. I want to\ndiscuss what happened outside the\ncourt on Wednesday morning.\nIt was a cold morning. No \u2013 it\nwas an unbelievably cold morning,\nwhich deteriorated further as the\nsnow and sleet kicked in. But this\ndidn\u2019t deter over 200 people from\ngathering for hours outside Bow\nStreet Magistrates Court in Covent\nGarden to protest against what was\nhappening inside.\nThis number included around\n40 people from Imperial College.\nThe official Union delegation was a\nmixed group of undergraduates and\npostgraduates, Muslims and non-Muslims, black and white, women\nand men. In fact, the turnout, particularly given the weather conditions,\nwas extremely impressive, with the\nonly notable absentee being our\nbeloved president, Mustafa Arif.\nIt is true to say that the protest really got going after we all\narrived, and despite not being able\nto use our megaphone, a considerable amount of noise was made.\nProtesters\u2019 chants ranged from\n\u201cFree, Free, Babar Ahmad\u201d to\n\u201cWhat do we want? Justice! When\ndo we want it? Now!\u201d But it was also\nclear that most people in attendance\nlinked what was happening to Babar\nto issues of civil liberties and the\n\u2018war on terror\u2019 in the wider world,\nwith \u201cTony Blair, you will see, Iraq\nand Babar will be free\u201d and \u201cHey!\nHo! We say no to Guantanamo\u201d\nalso ringing in the ears of those in\nthe court room. I learnt later that\nBabar and his family heard our\nchanting and were pleased at the\nlevel of support.\nAfter a short \u2018break\u2019 for tea, lunch\nand anything else that people could\nthink of to warm themselves back\nup, an even larger crowd gathered\naround the court again to listen to\nseveral speeches, many of which\npointed out the links between the\nrestriction of civil liberties and\nrecent events in the Middle East,\nwith the 19 March anti-war demo\nbeing frequently plugged.\nSpeakers ranged from Lindsey\nGerman (convenor of the Stop\nthe War Coaltion) to Yasmin\nAtaullah, a representative from the\nMuslim Association of Britain and\nRespect. There were also representatives from the Muslim community and the Socialist Workers\nParty, but perhaps the most moving\nspeech was saved to last. Follwing\nBabar\u2019s father and his solicitor\nwas Martin Mubanga, one of the\nfour Britons recently released from\nGuantanamo Bay. Listening to this\nman, who has been held captive in\nsome of the worst prison conditions\nin the world for the last three years,\nseemed to move the whole crowd\nand put into perspective the reality\nof what Babar may face if he loses\nhis case.\nThe large turnout was impressive,\nand showed many people\u2019s realisation that we have to keep the fight\non the streets as well as in the cour\nroom itself. It also showed good\npeople\u2019s willingness to stand up in\nthe face of evil, and to stand firmly\nagainst it. Whilst the turnout was\nhigh, we hope that even more of\nyou will join us next time, when\nBabar\u2019s hearing returns to court on\n18 April.\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\nLetters to the Editor\nPembridge prank\nproves costly\nDear Editor,\nHas anyone got a clue what is\ngoing on with Pembridge students\nbeing fined? Apparently a toilet was\nwallpapered with newspaper and\nrumour has it with some skill. A\nstudent prank, and not a bad one at\nthat either. However the whole hall\nhas been given a fine of \u00a320 each to\n\u2018cover the cost\u2019 of the damage, that\u2019s\nabout two and a half grand. I had a\nlook at the toilet and someone has\ntaken the paper down leaving no\ndamage to walls or the paintwork at\nall and if you have a look round the\nplace that toilet is somewhat unique\nin that respect. What\u2019s with the huge\ncost? Surely they cannot fine over\n100 innocent people when no actual\ndamage has been done, but we are\ntold if we do not pay it will be taken\nstraight out of our deposits.\nYours,\nName and department supplied\nSmoking ban\nDear Editor,\nI would like to applaud the Union\u2019s\ndecision to make DaVinci\u2019s bar\nsmoke-free. Smoking is antisocial,\nselfish and inconsiderate, so I am\ndisgusted by the unscrupulous tactics employed to incite smokers into\nretaliation.\nThis evening inflammatory notices were placed on every table,\nclearly designed to taunt smokers.\nThe signs carried a cartoon of a\nman smashing through a brick wall,\nwith an AK-47 in one hand and an\nUZI in the other, guns blazing. The\nwords NO SMOKING were painted\non the wall in dripping graffiti. When\nI asked a girl behind the bar about\nthe signs, I was told that \u201csometimes the end justifies the means\u201d,\nso I suspect they were created by\ndisgruntled staff who resent the no-smoking rules.\nI encourage everyone who, like\nme, detests being forced to inhale\nothers\u2019 fumes to visit DaVinci\u2019s this\nmonth and submit their feedback to\nthe Union.\nKind regards,\nWillard Wheezer\n(Real name and dept supplied)\nProtesters make their feelings clear outside Bow Street Magistrates Court\n\n"
