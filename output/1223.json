A pub crawl,\nLondon raid and a ball later, it'll end on\nIC Radio would like to wish you all a happy new year. And if \"listen to ICR\"\nwasn't one of your new year's resolutions,\nthen it really should have been!\nThe grand IC Radio station relaunch!\nFor a variety of reasons, it's taken longer\nthan expected to complete our brand new\nstudios in Beit Quad. We were broadcasting from the first day of term, but to be\nhonest the studios were a tip, we had\nabout half the equipment we really need-ed, and the production studio was merely\na figment of the technical team'si magi nation.\nBut now everything is finally up and\nrunning, including interview room and\n(shock!) production studio. As a result,\nwe've decided to stage a Station\nRelaunch event on Thursday 17th Jan. at\n7pm in the Union Bar. There'll be the\nusual fun and games, plenty of drinking\nand a chance to meet\\greet\\kill\\shag\nthose bastards who keep playing loud\nmusic in the mornings.\nRag Ramble\nFriday February 22nd with a School\nUniform Day and balloon lift on the\nQueen's Lawn.\nThe ICU Rag Week nominated charity is\nthe Shooting Star Appeal, raising money\nto build the first specialist hospice for terminally ill children in Kensington, Chelsea\nand all of West London.\nThe sexy new website on\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/rag will tell you what's going on, and so will Felix over the next\nfew weeks. There's every chance for you\nto get involved and get yourself out of the\nlibrary, so go on, you know you need a break by now...\nSave A Nation\nRespect to Islamic society and everyone who got involved in the \"Save A Nation\" campaign for Afghanistan last\nterm.

Well, IC Radio is an\nICU society, and so any IC student can\njoin. No experience is necessary, and\nthough we have over 100 members, we're\nalways on the lookout for new ones. We\nhave opportunities in every aspect of\nradio, from publicity to presenting.\nWhy choose us?\nBut, when presented with the ch bice of IC\nRadio or one of the myriad of other stations available to you, why should you listen to us? Well, our playlists are chosen\nespecially for the student audience. You\ncan listen to your friends/contemporaries/ enemies making stars/idiots of\nthemselves. Aside from a couple of minutes at the beginning of each hour, there\nare no adverts. We run loads of competitions and, due to the smaller audience,\nyou're a lot more likely to win. And apart\nfrom all that, you can come and present or\nFalmouth Keogh Rule!\nCongrats to John-Joe, Javed and the FK\nHall committee for putting on a storming\nshow to raise money for the Rotherham\nHospice in December. Everything from a Steps tribute band, leg waxing and slave\nauction to an unintentionally Full Monty\nraised \u00a3700, and a very good time was\nhad by all. Nice one, guys!\nCarolling for cash\nTwo groups of carol singers made beautiful music just before Christmas. A group\nfrom the medical school serenaded travelers at Victoria Station for CLIC, while IC\nchoir sang their hearts out at Marylebone\nstation and around the local mews just off\nExhibition Road for the Shooting Star\nAppeal.

    "content": "book reviews\nFinally we have Armadillo (1998), Boyd's tale of the \"little\narmed man\", Lorimer Black, who works as an insurance loss\nadjuster. Black wears invisible armour every day as he carefully prepares the image he will present to his business clients. In\nfact his whole life has been reinvented, so that the real Milo\nBlocj with his loving but demanding family are consigned to a completely separate sphere. Lorimer blends perfectly in a world\nwhere nothing is quite what it seems, but his stability is rocked\nwhen he is assigned to investigate a major business fraud that\nseems to taint everyone associated with it. To make his life even\nmore complicated he becomes infatuated with a woman he has\nglanced briefly, driving by in a taxi. Boyd extends the armour\nmetaphor even further as Lorimer Black collects ancient (and of\ncourse expensive) helmets. When he accidentally traps his own\nhead in his latest acquisition, he has to be freed by the local\ncasualty department, a literal release prompting him to reclaim\nhis real self. If you watched the recent television production of\nthis novel (adapted for the screen by Boyd), reading the book\ncan seem like looking over a familiar script. There is an extra\nsub-plot here concerning a rock musician who claims to have\nsuffered a debilitating breakdown, but who manages to rebuild\nhis career based on what he perceives and Black's other-world-ly cool (a taste for esoteric music), but otherwise Boyd's TV\ntranslation was faithful to the original.\nIt appears that Boyd has not lost his taste for oddball characters, far flung geographical locations and a long historical per-spec ti ve. April sees the publication of a new novel Any Human\nHeart: The Intimate Journals Of Logan Mountstuart, another fictional autobiography which promises to take us on a global journal through the twentieth century. Even after reading ten of his\nbooks in quick succession, my appetite is whetted rather than\nsatiated and I shall be joining the queues as the checkout.\nA Complete list of the works of William Boyd\nA Good Man in Africa (1982)\nAn Ice-Cream War (1983)\nOn The Yankee Station (1984)\nStars and Bars (1985)\nSchool Ties (1986)\nThe New Confessions (1988)\nBrazzaville Beach (1991)\nThe Blue Afternoon (1995)\nThe Destiny of Nathalie X and Other Stories (1997)\nArmadillo (1998)\nTo be published in April 2002 by Hamish-Hamilton is William\nBoyd's new novel, Any Human Heart: The Intimate Journals Of\nLogan Mountstuart (priced at \u00a317.99.)\nThis is the story of Logan Mountstuart, told through his intimate journals. His life spans the 20th century and his travels\ntake the reader from Uruguay to Oxford, Paris, the Bahamas,\nNew York and Africa. We meet his three wives, and notaries\nfrom the worlds of royalty and literature.\nAdrian\nOpen Season by CJ Box\nPutnam, $23.95\nGame warden, Joe Pickett is your ideal family man with a loving wife, Marybeth, two young daughters and another child on\nthe way. Joe is the ranger in Saddlestrmg, a small Wyoming\ntown which is typical of any rural American dwelling, right\ndown to Main Street and the large number of townsfolk who\nenjoy hunting in the nearby countryside.\nOne Sunday morning, Joe's discovers the body of a local outfitter in the woodpile in his backyard. In the man's hand is an\nempty cooler, which has all the signs that it contained a small\nanimal. This local man is no stranger to Joe as in the first week\nof his job Joe caught the outfitter, Ote Keeley, poaching deer.\nThe confrontation, at the time, ended with Ote humiliating Joe\nby grabbing his gun away from him.\nJoe immediately contacts the County Sheriff Bud Barnum and\nBarnum recalls that Ote had gone into the Bighorn Mountains\nwith two other men as part of a poaching ring. The Sheriff\ndecides to send one of his deputies along with Joe and Wacey\nHedeman, a neighbouring game warden into the mountains to\nbring back the other poachers. When they arrive at the campsite they find that the other guides have been murdered and a local vagrant (who was killed at the campsite when the rangers\nopened fire) is accused of the murders.\nThe case seems closed but Joe is not entirely happy and he\nhas many questions unanswered. These questions and especially their answers will not only affect Joe but serious jeopardize his life and that of his family.\nThis is the first novel by C.J. Box and will probably end up on\nnumerous short lists for best first novel. The plot, in my opinion,\nis interesting but quite thin and although it discusses many\nissues such as environmentalism, big industry and the struggle\nto do the right thing in life it doesn't cover any new ground.\nWhat makes this story stand out is the author's description of\nremote wilderness (similar to Steve Hamilton's A Cold Day in\nParadise) and his character development. This is definitely true\nof Joe. Some people would (cruelly) describe him as slow but is\nin fact quite sharp, deeply loyal, and very stubborn and has a devotion to his family above all else. The portrayal of his wife,\nhis daughters (especially his eldest, Sheridan) are equal believable while the lesser characters and equally convincing. Alas\nthough there were not enough potential villains and the dialogue sometimes sags. Box has heaps of potential for the future\nand many others would be proud of this as a first novel. One\nfinal thing I would like to say about this book is that it's the first\nbook of possible hundreds of mystery titles that I have read\nwhere I guessed both the villain and the reasons why the\ncrimes were committed about half way in. I'm still not sure if\nthis is a good thing or a bad one. The writing, though, was crisp\nenough to keep me interested in the characters until the very\nand quite shocking end.\nPublished my Putnam, $23.95 and is available from Amazon,\nCrime in Store and can be ordered from any leading bookshop.\n\n"

The\nadded crisis of actually landing\nmyself a girlfriend merely compounded the situation, and as\nsuch I'm not sure how interesting it would be to ask 'Should I take her out to dinner, go to\nthe pub, shag her senseless, or\npull her sister'.

    "content": "reviews music\nINTERVIEW with\nRichard from Hood\nHood's bassist Richard Adams spoke to Felix before their recent\ngig at the Arts Cafe (see review, right). The album Coid House\nis out now and was reviewed in Issue 1218.\nFELIX: Can you introduce yourself, and say what you do?\nRICHARD: I'm Richard and I play bass, and guitar sometimes.\nIs Cold House an intentional progression or did you have a plan at the start?\nA little bit, but, well, it was just a bit haphazard really. We had\na set of songs that we liked that fitted together, but a lot of it\nwas trial and error. We wanted to make a more diverse album,\nbecause we've done the same stuff throughout, but we wanted\nto do that without it sounding like a compilation LP - we wanted it to flow, so it was definitely intentional.\nIs there any symbolism behind the title, Cold House? Where\ndid that come from?\nIt was what Chris [lead vocals and guitar] wanted to call his\nstudio, 'cause he lives in a cold house, and no other titles that\nwe came up with really fitted. That one did, so it stayed, and we\nalso think that Cold House could be a genre of music.\nYou've got Dose One and Why? [from cLOUD DEAD] performing on the record - did you meet them to record it?\nThey approached us a couple of years ago, we hadn't heard of\nthem, but Chris just loved it and we thought \"let's get them in\non it\", 'cause we wanted to work with hip-hop people. We\nheard what they were doing and it wasn't dissimilar to our\nideas; we just had completely different backgrounds.\nAre you going to continue using hip-hop?\nI don't know really, 'cause we try to change stuff on every\nalbum. We want to do it but in a really commercial way, like Puff\nDaddy, so we want really commercial samples so we can have\na hit and sell out [laughs]. I really want to do it, but to make a full on hip-hop record would be too much of an obvious move.\nI noticed more than ever on CcJd House that there are elements of glitch core and electronica, really similar to stuff on\nToytronic and Tigerbeat Six. How do you feel about comparisons to artists like Kid606 and Cex?\nIt's OK, but I think we're more interested in Autechre and Boards\nOf Canada and stuff like that over here. I mean, I do like Cex and\nKid606, but I also want something with a tune and a melody\nthat you can follow. It's the more melodic end of electronica that\nwe like, but we're not closed to more abstract ideas.\nFinally, are there any live antics planned for tonight?\nWe always want to make a lot more sound live, so it's not just\nlike someone putting a CD on. We want to make it a bit different and more aggressive. But we're not as intense as we used\nto be. When we played with Mogwai about two years ago, they\ninvited us up to play on Like Herod, and my brother Chris just\ncame on with his BMX and started riding around the stage in\nhuge circles. It was one of the most surreal things I 've ever seen\nin my life. We're not going to be quite as wild as that tonight, I don't think. Unless Chris is planning something in secret...\nChris\nLIVE: Hood + Wauvenfold +\nCassette Boy @ Arts Cafe\nTonight's show features one of the most flawless line-ups I have\never experienced. Wauvenfold are first to the stage. Tom Hill\nand Noel Murphy mutilate twitch y cut-up beats and squeeze\nnumerous melodic gurgles from their mixers and laptops,\nsounding established and confident. Playing tracks from their\nrecent On the Blink ER Wauvenfold perform their songs with\nease and humour in a live environment, adding a much-needed\nwarmth to their compositions.\nCassette Boy follow, with their peculiar blend of topical performance art and satirical cut 'n' paste. Very sick indeed, but\nvery humorous nonetheless. Perhaps they could rely less on\nshock tactics and yes, perhaps they could attempt something\nmore original. But as far as disturbing, sardonic musical projects go, they're pretty unbeatable tonight.\nFinally Hood (pic above) take to the stage. This is the last leg of\ntheir UK tour, promoting their powerful new album Cold House.\nOpening with They Removed All Trace That Anything Had Ever\nHappened Here, they pitch breakbeat rhythms against haunting\nviolin drones, hesitant guitar and a delicate forlorn vocal.\nCold indeed! You can feel it in the air, as their music seems to\nconvey heightened emotion. Yet Hood's music sounds comparatively warmer live than on record, with Gavin's faultless drumming technique en erg ising the band and transforming them\ninto a more relentless and aggressive unit.\nFinding time to perform a few older numbers, Hood build up\ntheir set subtly until a critical point is reached when they\nexplode into their finale, Diesel Pioneers. Ten minutes of furious\nmes m eric white noise follows, until Hood decide that enough is\nenough and quit the stage to rapturous applause. A spectacular performance from a naturally impressive band.\n9B000 Francois & Chris\n\n"

Then\nthe other two left and Danny [Andriano] joined and then me.\nWe'd all been in various punk bands before, and we all knew of\neach other.\nWhat's the motivation behind the band?\nThe main motivation was to emulate our idols - the Sex Pistols,\nthe Ramones, punk derived from the aesthetic...\nBut the Sex Pistols weren'ta real punk band, they were more\nof a novelty band...\nWell, we're really more interested in the image. We love the\nschlocky misfits kind of performance. In that sense, the music is\nsecondary - it's the visual effect we go for.\nHow have you enjoyed this tour?\nThe other two tours were a disappointment in every way. The\ninterest, the vehicles, the turnout, the food, everything. But on\nthis one, every show is better than the last. The only real problem is trying to sleep.\nOne thing I like about your music is the attention paid to\nlyrics...\nYeah, that's one thing Matt is definitely good at. I suppose that\nthe imagery and gimmicks are good, but we wouldn't want to\nmake them overtly so. At the end of the day, the lyrics are\nimportant.\nI 've heard and interviewed a lot of up and coming indie bands\nhere at UL U, and I can't remember any of their names. Why do you think you're going to be any different?\nI don't know. Our goal is just to play music. Success or lack of it\nis coincidental, but it would be welcomed.\nRobert\nOUT THIS WEEK\nThe following are due out on Monday 14 January.

    "content": "talk felix\nBy Nate Evuarherhe\nI was most disappointed to hear last term,\nthat the Lecturer Evaluation Scheme was a dismal and utter failure owing principally to\nstudent apathy, and a number of other\nGreat Union Screw-Ups. (Namely poorly\nwritten, hack-able computer programmes.)\nIf you've ever wondered how on earth some\nlecturers of this University managed to get\nthe jobs they currently hold, this was a much-awaited chance for us to do some\nevaluation and academic feedback, and I think the Union owes it to the entire student\nbody to orchestrate an evaluation/feedback\nprogramme of some sort.\nBut as far as brilliant ideas go, this is\nabout where it stops. Not only was the\nentire scheme poorly and incompetently\nrun, but it was also revealed last term, that\nstudents of the computing department had\ndetected a bug in the supposedly secure\nonline system. That means of course, that if\nyou took the time to log on and evaluate\nyour lecturer, the said lecturer could (in the-or y) be looking at your evaluation and plotting to fail you at the end of the year.\nThe bottom-line being, that somewhere\nbetween student apathy, and yet another\nGreat Union Screw-Up, a wonderfully br il Inkwell\nlian t idea went drastically wrong.\nStudent apathy, as is by and large the\ncase, was clearly the result of a belief in an\ninability to effect change... a sense of impotence. A feeling that the evaluation would\nultimately amount to nothing and, at the\nend of the day, horribly bad lecturers would\nstill roam the halls next year, and beyond.\nThe Scheme failed to make clear the possible consequences of student opinion.\nWhat happens to those lecturers we deem\nto be grossly incompetent, and fundamentally bad teachers? Do they get the sack?\nDo they get a talking to by the head of the\ndepartment or what?\nThe poorly conceived scheme failed to\nconvince students on why it was important\nthat they voted. The result being that voter\napathy was inevitable from the start.\nThe timing was also horribly wrong.\nThere is a student \"cycle of life\" at IC. In the\nfirst few weeks of term, the student is live-ly, energetic, and bubbling with enthusiasm to make the best of the term etc. etc. Of\ncourse by week 6, this becomes a figment of\nthe imagination, and by week 9 nobody\nreally gives a dead rat about study groups\nand seminars anymore. The idea of carrying\nout lecturer evaluation in the dying weeks\nof the term was an ill-advised and unintelligent one. In plain and simplistic terms, by\nthat time of the term, nobody gives a monkeys about anything anymore. Most certainly not \"lecturer evaluation\"! A scheme in\nthe very first weeks of the second, or third\nterm would have been a far more fruitful\nand successful project.\nAnd finally, let it be said, that the hacking\nof the supposedly secure website, by students of the computing department, speaks\nof shamefully farcical planning by the\nUnion. If Imperial College of Science and\nTechnology (keywords: science and tech-no logy) cannot adequately produce a viable\nand operational online system, then in all\nfairness, how can the Union ever be taken\nseriously?\nThe sad and unfortunate result of all this,\nis that the small number of IC students who\nfelt the need to voice their opinion about the\npeople who teach them, would of course\nremain unheard, and this is heart-breaking.\nAfter all let's face it, a great many of the\nlecturers who walk these halls are simply\nexcruciatingly bad teachers, who make sitting in a lecture like watching a really long\nmonologue in a badly written play.\nThe Student voice must be heard.\nEditorial\nHappy New Year, dear readership, and welcome to another term of journalistic delight.\nThis first issue, I will be the first to admit, is\nslightly paltry, perhaps. While the excuse is\nlame: many of my writers have not returned\nto the fold yet, it is valid, in that I believe\nthat it is my job to edit this newspaper, and\nensure its continuing existence financially,\nbut not nec ess a rly to write it all. This is\nmeant to be a student news papa er. Not to\nmention how lazy I am.\nI have been informed by nearly everyone\nthat my editorials are boring and full of useless information. Now I thought that this\nwas fun and quirky, but apparently it's not.\nAs such, I'm now going to fulfill the point of\nan editorial by, in the words of a so-called\nfriend, 'creating a coherent view of the\nissues raised in that week's publication'.\nSo, news. Ah yes, that which we don't write until Wednesay night, and now is\nMonday night (split deadlines). Fine, so\nthat'll not happen. I 'll comment on other\nissues.\nLEQs. Oh yes. You can see the Inkwell\nabove is discussing this, and while I agree\nwith his sentiments, I feel it should be\npointed out that the Union is not entirely to\nblame (especially the security matters), as\nInkwell implies, but since it represents all\nstudents here, it should have been more\nsure that everything went according to\nplan. However, you can't ever tell College\nwhat to do, sadly. The words 'lumbering'\nand 'behemoth' spring to mind.\nIn fact, having spoken (personally, and\nnot professionally) to various important\npeople in the Union, it is clear that the LEQs\nwere actually very important to them, and\nfrom what I know, most of the blame should\nbe laid on College.\nSimilarily, there is a letter complaining on\nthe same subject, and from the negative\nfeedback that Felix and others have\nreceived, I have to say that it seems that\nthere could be a few improvements.\nHowever nothing ever works first time, and\nthis is the first year that it has been a joint\nUnion-College venture, so I'm willing to\ngive them a chance. If they screw up next\nyear, however...\nSo that was my attempt at trying to be\ntopical and actually commenting seriously\non the issues that affect the students.\nPerhaps I'm too apathetic al, but frankly that\nwas a real effort. I think next time I 'll stick\nto something easier, like random banter and\nspace filling when I have half a page left...\nnot that I mean that.\nNo really. So I think I 'll stick to what I know, and do something easier, like discussing my sex life. Last week I went to\nbed with several nubile young...\n\n"

    "content": "reviews book\nThe Second Part of the\nnovels of William Boyd\nThe article published in Felix last term reviewed the first five\nbooks of William Boyd. Here we examine his more recent\nwork, starting with what many consider to be his most\naccomplished novel The New Confessions (1987). It is certainly his longest and most ambitious work, taking in major world\nevents throughout the first half of the twentieth century. It\ntakes the form of the fictional autobiography of John James\nTodd, who as we have come to expect in Boyd's work, is\nsomething of a loner, struggling to relate with his family,\nfriends and society. The plot takes us from an austere Scottish\nupbringing, including of course another vivid account of life\nat a public school, albeit an extremely eccentric one. Apart\nfrom an early gift for mathematics (a fascination of Boyd's to\nwhich he returns in his next novel), Todd finds his main creative outlet in photography, which eventually guides him towards his career as a film director. The novel takes us\nthrough the horrors of the trenches in the First World War, and\na period in a German prisoner of war camp, which provides\nTodd with the contacts that enable him to get a foothold in\nthe fledgling German film industry, where he eventually\nmakes his reputation. His only reading material as a prisoner\nis Rousseau's Confessions, which becomes an obsession for\nhim and the main key to the novel. It is certainly, true that\nwhen the action moves away from Germany with the rise of\nNazism and with Todd attempting to .build a new career in\nHollywood, the story begins to lose momentum. Todd sees little action in the Second World War and the main battles in the\nlatter part of his life come with the spectre of McCarthyism. It\nmay perhaps be a truthful reflection of a life where great early\npromise is never fully realised and where the twilight years\nmay offer a chance of redemption (the are many things in\nTodd's life for which he has no cause to be proud), but not\nnecessarily a happy ending. One gets the impression that\nBoyd has enthusiastically embarked upon an epic, but ultimately hasn't the stamina to complete the task, but if this\nremarkable book fails to live up to its early promise, the\nattempt is never less than entertaining and for the most part\nit is compelling.\nIn Brazzaville Beach (1990) Boyd examines many ethical\nissues relating to the nature of scientific research. He manages to weave these concerns into a plot which encompasses\na doomed love story that takes place within the Mathematics\nDepartment at Imperial College (a backdrop in name only, the\ndepartment is fortunately un recognisable) leading the main\ncharacter, Hope Clearwater to flee London for an African primate research station, where she attempts to piece her life\nback together. While the events in England that led to her\nflight are gradually revealed in flashback, the situation in\nAfrica becomes fraught as her research on the chimpanzee\ncommunity begins to radically conflict with the long held theories of the project leader. The violence she observes in the\nchimps behaviour is mirrored by the civil war taking place\naround her and the desperate attempts of senior members of\nthe research team to suppress her findings.\nBoyd handles this plot with incredible skill, combining a novel of ideas with an action thriller. This is the third of his\nnovels to be at least partially set in Africa and these scenes\nconstitute the most powerful and evocative aspects of a complex but highly readable and gripping story.\nFor his next novel Blue Afternoon (1993), Boyd moves to a new continent, with most of the action taking place in Manila\nin 1902. At one level this is an intriguing detective story in an\nunfamiliar historical setting. Salvador Carriscant is a doctor,\ndedicated to introducing modern medical practices into a country which is just recovery from a bloody colonial war\nwith the USA. His infatuation with the wife of an American\narmy officer develops into a full blown affair, whilst at the\nsame time a series of murders takes place with the evidence\npointing to the perpetrator being a medical man.\nThis central core of the novel is book ended by the story of\nKay Fischer, a struggling Los Angeles architect, who in 1936\nencounters Carriscant as an old man when he comes to her\nclaiming to be her father. This dual perspective opens up the\nstory, deepening the mystery surrounding Carriscant, so that\nalthough one can admire his efforts to modernise the Manila\nhospital when faced with every kind of obstructiveness, prejudice and suspicion, he remains something of an enigma.\nOnce again Boyd displays his mastery of a complex narrative,\nmaintaining the suspense and delivering a few shocks in the\nprocess.\nThe Destiny of Nathalie X(1995) is Boyd's second short\nstory collection and it is dominated by the title story, which is\none of the best things he has written. The social satire of his\nthird novel Stars and Bars was sometimes overblown, but\nhere it is razor sharp.\nIn 40 pages he dissects modern Hollywood as producers,\nagents and actors queue up to exploit the latest European art\nhouse success in the shape of a new African / French director\nAurelian. Our hero is probably insane, but the industry is desperate to laud his genius with devastating and hilarious\nresults. Nothing else in this sometimes experimental collection quite matches this opening shot, but all the stories are\nentertaining.\n\n"

    "content": "charity feature\nSave A Nation campaign raises El 3K \u00a313,600. A small or a large amount of\nmoney? To you and I an immense amount,\nbut what is it to Afghanistan's eight million people in desperate need of aid? A welcome gesture of compassion from\nImperial College students.\nIn an attempt to raise money for the\nAfghan people, and to bring about a greater awareness of the many hardships\nthey are facing, Imperial College's Islamic\nSociety decided to run an appeal during\nthe last few weeks of the winter term.\nEntitled, 'Save a Nation' and with the slogan Act Now1\n, it aimed to raise \u00a310 000 to\ndonate to Islamic Relief, a UK registered\nchanty that has been working in\nAfghanistan since 1992.\nThe campaign was planned to coincide\nwith the Islamic holy \u201e\nmonth of Ramadan,\nwhich sees Muslims\nacross the globe fasting for thirty days.\nWith empty stomachs,\nit is always easier to\nemp a this e with those\nless fortunate and consequently it is a time\nwhen Muslims are\nencouraged to give\ngenerously to people\nin need. Furthermore,\nRamadan provided the\nperfect opportunity to\nintroduce friends\naround campus to\nMuslim traditions such as fasting, breaking fast and praying together, allowing\nthe other cultures at Imperial to become\npart of the appeal.\nFittingly, the opening event of the campaign was an Inter-Soc Iftaar dinner (a meal to break fast). Dinner was provided\nby the Islamic society, but the real treat\nfor the night were the snacks supplied by\nIC's national societies: PakSoc came bearing samos as, MalaySoc, spring rolls and\nArabSoc traditional Arabian pastries.\nFood was followed by a short presentation from Islamic Relief about their work\nin Afghanistan, at the end of which it was\nexplained to the 200 strapped-for-cash IC\nstudents present how a little money goes\na long way. Confronted with facts such as\nthat five pounds provides a child with\nflour for a month, even the poorest con-tribute d. At the close of the event one of\nthe campaign, the total amount raised\nstood at \u00a32000.\nDuring the following weeks, further collections were made after the Islamic\nSociety's daily if t aar( held throughout\nRamadan in the JCR) and after the weekly Friday prayers, which alone raised\nmore than \u00a35000 over the duration of the\ncampaign. Young, innocent first years\nwere dressed in luminous yellow jackets,\ngiven big buckets and also sent collecting\naround campus, but by far the most successful collection (also being equally the\nmost embarrassing) was the collection\nescapade on the 8th December. Equipped\nwith more yellow jackets and this time\nsandwich boards for good measure, the\nIslamic Society's more adventurous members travelled to Green Street for a full\nday's collection aimed at Saturday shop-per s. They returned with \u00a31500 to add to\na fast rising total.\nNo appeal is complete without a few\nbazaars and jumble sale type events so in\ntrue Blue Peter style two bazaars were\nheld in the JCR selling 'Save a Nation'\nmerchandise. This included a very stylish\nblack T shirt fronted by the appeal logo\n(still available if anyone is interested), cds\nof 'Muslim vocal performance' and Eid\ngreeting cards. These proved successful\nways of raising money, as people were\nmore willing to give for something in\nreturn, and the sales resulted in the campaign being publicised widely across\ncampus.\nA sponsored run in Hyde Park marked\nthe grand finale of the campaign. Around\nthirty (insane or committed?) people gave\nup their last Wednesday afternoon of\nterm to run around the Serpentine in the\ncold December air. Some (less insane or\nless committed?) people walked around.\nWalking or running, a single lap around\nthe Serpentine added a further \u00a32000 to\nthe appeal.\nThe total amount of money raised\nthrough this campaign stands at \u00a313,600,\nsurpassing the aim and everyone's expectations. This money will go towards the\ncommunity projects being run by Islamic\nRelief in Afghanistan and maintaining the\nmany refugee camps that have been\nformed in the last few months. It will help\nprovide much needed food, water and\nhygiene kits for the\nAfghan people. Islamic\nRelief has a refreshing\napproach to humanitarian aid, taking into\nconsideration the\nneeds of the host population and trying to\nprovide respect, consistency and fairness\nin its relief work.\nThe Islamic Society\nwould like to thank\neveryone who took\npart in the various\nevents for their time\nand effort, as well as\nthe other Imperial societies that helped out. The biggest thank\nyou, however, goes to all of the IC students and staff who donated money to\nthe appeal, allowing us to show our fellow beings in Afghanistan that we care.\nWe hope that amidst all the money collecting and fun people became more\naware of the problems being faced by\npeople in Afghanistan, and that our work\nfor them does not end with this cam-pa ign. For anyone wishing to give to Islamic\nReliefs Afghanistan Appeal you can contact Islamic Relief on 08704 443 132 or\nvisit their website at www.islamic-relief.com. There is still much work to be\ndone and money is desperately needed.\nICU Islamic Society\nislam@ic.ac. uk\n\n"

ERASMUS too, one of the newest\nadditions to the OSC group,\nwere looking strong blending\nfootball styles from across\nEurope to dazzling effect.\nTowards the end of the group\nstage things were reaching\nboiling point, with everyone\nfighting tooth and nail for a coveted spot in the quarterfinals.\nSurprise team of the Cup were\nundoubtedly Thai Soc whose\nintricate passing and lighting\nspeed saw them all the way to\nthe semis.\nLittle praise could be given to\nthe OSC Exec team; they were\ndescribed by some as being in\nthe midst of a \"Manchester\nUnited style\" crisis. Having\nassembled an all-star line up,\nincluding three of last year's Afro Caribbean Society win-ne rs,a series of ludicrous errors\na la Messers Barthez and Cole\nmeant that going into their last\ngame they were without a point.

The first semi\nWrestlemania\nThis winter saw the brave\nmembers of the Imperial\nCollege Mixed Mud Wrestling\nTeam (ICMMWT) intrepidly\nsetting out into the arctic\nwastes of North Wales to\nengage in combat on the peak\nof Snowdon, where they were\nto obliterate all opposition to\ngain the title of 'Dirtiest Little\nMonkeys In The World'.\nThis was no easy task, how-ever, having to take on the\ncream of the world's crop of\nmud wrestlers, but one that\nthe I CMM WT faced with guts\nand determination.\nThe first bout saw Lindsey\n'Dirty' Brookes taking on Fai\nChun 'Hu-Lang' Jones, where\nthey tussled in the deep, deep\nmud, vying for that fatal\nmoment when they could\nstrike the killing blow, and\nrender the other one topless.\nUsing a cunning manoeuvre\nlearnt in 'Nam, Lindsey soon\ngot the upper hand, ripping\nthe flimsy fabric of her opponent's bodice asunder like so\nmuch moist tissue paper.\nThe next round saw James\n'Dirty Dirty' Saffin demolish\npoor Odin 'Dirty Dirty Dirty'\nWatts, for another 8 points to\nthe ICMMWT, and this lead\nwas built upon by Penny\n'Filthy, Dirty, Filthy, Little\nMonkey' Moomin, whose top-ripping technique was un sur passed, bringing the rather\nmuddy cup back home. Where\ncan we go from here, but\ndown? Into the mud...\nsaw Sikh Soc thrash the Thais\n4-0 (including a blistering hattrick from Player of the\nTournament - Parveiz Petkar)\nleaving Sikh 'keeper Stuart\n\"Singh\" Coleman without having to make a save.\nThe second semi saw ERASMUS continuing with their solid\nbrand of football to grind out a20 victory over the decidedly\nfrustrated Turkish side. And so\nthe final saw ERASMUS line up\nagainst the as-yet-unbeaten\nSikh Soc team.\nThe third-fourth play-off was\nnaturally a low-key affair with\nthe tired looking Thai side\ngoing down 3-0. This left all\neyes focused on Court 1 for the\nGrande Finale where much\nwas expected of the two final-is ts; and neither failed to di sap point. Both teams shook of their\ntiredness to contest the match\nof the tournament. Sikh Soc,\ndespite not having any substitutes for the whole competition\ngave as good as they got and\nresponded with a cracking\nequalise r having gone 1-0\ndown.\nERASMUS though left a little in\nreserve going ahead with two\nclassic strikes, which would\nnot look out of place in next\nsummers World Cup in\nJapan/South Korea. They\nweathered late pressure from\nthe Sikh side well surviving a last minute disallowed equal is er and the tantrums of Sikh Live\nWire Vishaal Chhatralia (EE2)\neventually running out 3-2 winners and champions of the tour-name nt.

    "content": "music reviews\nJimmy Eat World\nJimmy Eat World\nOut now on Dreamworks records\nThis is the fourth album from the up and\ncoming American pop thrashers. It was\nrecorded with the band's own money\nafter they were dropped from their previous record label.\nThe release of Jimmy Eat World was\noriginally planned for the middle of\nOctober but due to its unfortunate original title [Bleed American), they thought it\nbest in light of the events of 11\nSeptember to postpone the release and\nrethink the title too.\nThis is a typically American album,\nand I mean that in a good way. From the\nlyrics to the production, it is refreshing.\nBands more about machismo than substance - the likes of Blink 182 and Limp\nBizkit - currently dominate the American\nmusic scene, and this really is the perfect\nantidote to such dross.\nJimmy Eat World are a band with their\nhearts strapped firmly to their sleeves.\nSongs like Hear You Me, // You Don't, Don't and Your House certainly would not\nlook out of place on, say, a soundtrack for\nDawson's Creek - you know, when they\nsit around a fire and discuss their best\never hot chocolate moment and then\nsmile at each other while exchanging\nglances of unrequited love. Anyway...\nThe album opener and first single, Salt\nSweat Sugar, hits you between the eyes\nlike a ballistic missile, and while you're\nstill reeling from that, Praise Chorus\nleaves you sadistically wanting more.\nFor those less intense moments, tracks\nlike The Middle and The Authority Song\nfeature pop sensibility crossed with killer\nhooks.\nThere's something for everyone.\nCandidate\nTiger Flies\nVarious\nA Wireless Nation Vol 1\nOut Monday 28 Jan on Snowstorm records Out now on GranKru records\nCandidate first found their way into the\nspotlight in April of last year when their\ndebut album Taking On The Enemy's Sound was released, but after playing\none gig they dived back into their shell\nand disappeared. And as they say - out\nof sight, out of mind.\nBut not for long. The north London\nfour-piece are back, and with something\nspecial. Tiger Flies is a delicate mix of\nnatural rhythms and chilled-out melodic\nsamples, which sounds like the bizarre\nlove child of Zero 7 and Coldplay.\nBe warned - this isn't the kind of music\nyou can just listen to. It's the kind of\nmusic you have in the background when\nyou're doing really important things, like\ncoursework or seducing your gentle-man/lady/farm animal of choice.\nIf you pay attention though, amidst the\ntwinkling guitars and unobtrusive beats,\nthere are colourful lyrics with hidden\nmeanings and double entendres sprinkled throughout.\nThe really amazing thing about this\nband is the fact that they can play a myriad of weird and wonderful instruments,\nfrom hammond organ to waikiki guitar\nand back again.\nThe really bad thing about this band is\nthat their vocalist desperately needs to\nwork on his voice. I can say this again\nand again about so many bands - they\ntry so hard with their music that they forget to find someone who can actually\nsing.\nApart from that, this is a good, solid\nalbum from a band who are going somewhere provided that they don't disappear\nfrom the scene like last time.\nThis is a compilation album featuring the\nbest of UK rap and drum 'n' bass.\nThe compilation is centred around the\n\"A Letter To Tony Blair\" campaign, which\nattempts to implement legislation forcing radio stations to play at least 40%\nBritish origin music, 20% of which must\nbe that of new or un established bands.\nThis would no doubt increase the variety\nof music on our airwaves. The campaign\nis being run by GranKru records in conjunction with the Media Access Trust.\nThey say, among other things, that such\na law would \"enhance and benefit local\ncreativity\".\nThe CD includes music from such luminaries as the Freestylers, Asian Dub\nFoundation (pic above), Grooverider and\nMaxim of the Prodigy. Because of this, it\nfeatures quite a diverse range of styles\nwithin the two main genres - hip-hop and\ndrum 'n' bass. One might have thought\nthat there was more \"music of British ori-gin\" than this (house, indie and rock productions are conspicuous by their\nabsence). Still, for the two genres covered it gives a pretty broad overview\nwith some quality tracks.\nThe Optical and Ed Rush piece\nCompound is a particular favorite. It features a sort of deep throbbing bass noise\nsimilar to that on Crazy (no, not the\nBritney Spears track) and is a nice slice of\ndrum 'n' bass.\nSome of the less well-known acts have\nproduced songs especially for the album,\nberating the music industry. As a political tool, I don't know how this will fare.\nAs a compilation album, it's OK but far\nfrom brilliant.\nID Warul Jess Alex\n\n"

Well it's Pulp's on page 16\nand William Boyd's \u00a9 ip apIS Teddington Under Threat\nTeddington, the favoured sports field of\nthe average medic, is in great danger of\nbeing sold, a recent confidential College\ndocument has suggested. This possibility\nhas been the subject of rumours for years,\nbut the document has indicated that IC\nwill submit an application for residential\nplanning permission in \"the early part of\n2002\". However, we cannot find any evidence that this has taken place yet.\nThe sports ground at Teddington was\ngiven to the St. Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool (SMHMS) as a gift by Lord\nBeaverbrook in1935, to show his gratitude for medical treatment he had received, but since the merger of Imperial\nCollege and SM HMS in1989, it has\nbecome the property of College.\nA few years ago, a review of sports facilities, conducted by Frank Murray, demonstrated that IC had an excess of outdoor\nsports grounds in proportion to its require-ment s, whether this allows for separate\nC CU teams or not is not known. Ideally,\nCollege would like to find one centrally\nlocated ground, which would ac com mo:?% Mall -ff ii J iff lM BP \u2022 -'\nThe Pavillion at Teddington\ndate all of the outdoor sports requirements for IC. However, although this may\nsound attractive, it is not known whether\na suitable ground has been identified. A review was initiated eight months ago to\nassess how each of the outdoor sports\ngrounds could best be utilised and in an\narticle for the ICSM Gazette, Neil Mosley,\nThe Sports and Leisure Manager, stated\nthat no decisions would be made regarding the future of the sports grounds until\nthe results of this review were published.\nHowever, it is also known that, at this\ntime, a firm of planning consultants was\nappointed to investigate how planning\npermission could be secured for\nTeddington, despite the anticipated opposition from Richmond Council, the local\nresidents and sports governing bodies\nsuch as Sports England and the National\nPlaying Fields Trust. Although the results\nof the review are not yet known to stu-dents, the College Strategic Plan has outlined that they will sell one of the sports\nfield over the course of the next two years,\nand while Teddington is not explicitly\nmentioned in relation to this, a later part of\nthe plan states that it is \"under review\",\nwhile all the other major sports areas will\nbe kept for continuing use. One interesting point is that this is expected to generate only \u00a34 million, where it has been suggested that the ground should generate\nsomething in the region of \u00a320 million, but\ncontinued on page 2\n\"No appeal is complete without a few bazaars and jumble sale type\nevents.\nIlk. j^ MW*\nOr a nice white elephant.\n\n"

OK,\nso they're not fat, but two of them are certainly portly. They're\nalso geeks - this is apparent from their use of crazy sounds with\nmuch knob twiddling. And ironic dancing too. They do their job\nand then let a real showman take the stage.\nThe last time I saw Jarvis Cocker was in Stoke Newington a year or two ago, around the time Pulp released This is Hardcore.\nAs you may recall, this was when he went a bit funny and\n\"introspective\". Needless to say, he was terrified to see someone\nwho'd recognised him. Thankfully tonight, the Jarvis of old is\nback, all elbows and posturing and wriggling.\n\"It's been a while since we've been here\", says Jarvis wistful-ly, gazing around the sold-out arena. The next moment, he leaps\nup onto a monitor and starts waggling his wrist. \"That's still\nloose\". Then he raises his leg and gives it a shake. \"And that still\nworks... so let's do it\".

They then played\neight songs back to back consisting mainly of those from the\nalbum 1977, including Angel Interceptor and Oh Yeah.\nIt soon dawned on me that this was going to.be a brilliant gig\n- it was the last of the tour, Tim's voice was on fire, and the band\nwere putting their all into it. After the first eight songs there\nwas a shift in style, as they played tracks from Free All Angels.\nWalking Barefoot was exceptional, as I think everyone else\nagreed, to go by the applause they received. I noticed after an\nhour that no songs from Trailer or Nu-Clear Sounds had been\nplayed, but that didn't matter - they worked the crowd well,\nplaying the favourites early on.\nAsh then revealed two interesting facts: firstly, Westlife have\na sense of humour (still to be proven) and secondly, Westlife are\ndrug gies. Tim went on to explain that Westlife rolled them a joint using a \u00a320 note, at which point they burst into Burn Baby\nBurn - fantastic!\nAfter a few more tunes such as Candy and Jesus Says, they\nwent off, only to return for an encore; and what an encore! It\nwas the longest encore I 've ever heard, lasting over 45 minutes,\nwith new songs, covers, fake snow falling from the balcony and\nthe band's determination to make it their longest gig ever,\nwhich it eventually was.

    "content": "reviews book\nBlock, Orion, \u00a316.99\nIf I had any choice in the matter I would love to make a home for\nmyself in New York. After numerous trips to this city it is one\nplace I feel totally comfortable both with the people and the\ntown itself. Over this past year I have read numerous novels\n(especially mysteries) which take place in this city and its five\nboroughs. I can say that the best writer, in my mind, who manages to get a grip, not just now but for the last four decades, on\nthe vibrant cosmopolitan and dark side of this city is the writer\nof the Matt Scudder series, Lawrence Block.\nA prominent and well-to-do New York City couple, Bryne and\nSusan Hollander, returning to their Upper West Side apartment\non a fine summer day are brutally murdered by two thieves and\ntheir bodies are discovered a few hours later by their daughter,\nKristin.\nA few days later the murderers are found dead in a Brooklyn\napartment. The likelihood is that their deaths resulted from a murder/suicide after a falling out. To the police this is an open-and-shut case but the couple's niece has her suspicions that\ntheir daughter, who inherits a fortune with their deaths, is\ninvolved somehow. She relays these doubts to Matt Scudder\nwho decides to look at the case for her and of course he discovers more than just a simple robbery/murder.\nIn this the fifteenth Scudder novel, the former alcoholic PI is\nvery different from the young man that was introduced 30 years\nago. Scudder has aged with each book (he is now 61) and so his\nreactions, both physical and mental, are not as quick as they\nonce were. He has mellowed over the years and works more\nwith the police than once he did.\nHope to Die has many of the familiar characters that we have\nbeen introduced to in previous novels such as Elaine, Mick\nBallou and TJ. Block writes about the people and their actions\nwith shocking reality as he does with New York itself.\nLike with all Scudder novels, I can find no faults with this\nnovel and it would seem that Lawrence Block is as good a writer as when he started out many years ago.\nNote: Hope to Die can be read as a stand alone but to get a proper feel for Matt and his past I would start earlier. Some fans\nsay that new readers should start with either the fifth or sixth\nnovels (Eight Million Ways To Die and When The Sacred Ginmill\nCloses.) Starting with these novels you are introduced straight\naway with the brilliance of Block's writing but they miss out on\nMatt's alcoholism. For me you have to start with the first book\n(The Sins Of The Fathers) to get a true feeling for the world of\nMatthew Scudder.\nFor those who do wish to begin at the beginning, Orion has\njust published the first three Matt Scudder novels in a very\nattractive trade paperback entitled The Matt Scudder\nMysteries Volume I: The Sins Of The Fathers/ In The Midst Of\nDeath/ Time To Murder And Create priced at a very reasonable \u00a310.99 and available in any major or specialist bookshop.\nThe Best Reads of 2001\nBelow I have compiled a list of what I consider to have been the\nbest books that I personally read in 2001. Not all books were\npublished in 2001 but they were read over the past year.

A return to the\n1980's( when inflation topped\n10%) would cripple the co un try.

The Trustees, of\nwhom the Union President is one, welcome applications for grants from students in the College and have a maximum\nof \u00a350,000 to allocate each year.\nThe principles under which the\nTrustees operate have been laid down by\nthe College's Governing Body. Perhaps\ndue to the origins of the funding, income\nfrom the Trust is intended for the benefit\nof IC students mainly in relation to sport-ing, athletics and recreational facilities,\nthough only to finance new or improved\nfacilities, and not to meet running costs or\nreplacement of consumables.\nIn making their decisions the Trustees\nwill weigh up the cost of the bid versus\nits potential benefit, the financial risk\nshould other sources of funding be\ninvolved, the merit of the bid (i.e. whether\nit is likely to enhance or maintain the reputation of the College) and whether it is\nlikely to unduly benefit those who are not\ncurrent students.\nThose activities with Union backing\n(i.e. part of an official club or society) and\na long and sustainable existence are more\nlikely to gain support. While it is usually\ngroups that benefit, it is also possible for\nstudents to submit individual bids,\nthough often they will compete either at\ncollege level or higher, thus enhancing\nthe prestige of the College.\nExploration Board\nThe Exploration Board was set up in 1955\nunder the sponsorship of the College, the\nUnion and the Constituent College\nAssociations to consider proposals for\nexpeditions submitted by students of the\nCollege, and to administer funds given by\nthe sponsors to assist with the cost of\nthese expeditions. Each of the sponsoring\nbodies is represented on the Board, which\nmeets twice a year to consider proposals\nsubmitted to it.\nThe Board may decide to recognise\nexpeditions as official College ventures,\nthus providing insurance for personnel\nand equipment. In many cases recognition carries with it a grant towards the\ncost, though most expeditions are also\nrequired to raise support in the form of\nmoney or equipment from sources outside\nthe College. In addition, a variety of\nequipment is held for loan to approved\nexpeditions.\nThe final meeting of the Board for this\nacademic year will take place on 6th February, so if you are planning an expedition for this summer you need to start\nputting together proposals immediately.\nSee www.su.ic.ac.uk/exploration for\nmore information\nRob\nEating Disorders\nEating Disorders\nEating disorders affect many people.\nAnorexia Nervosa sees the individual\nstarving them while Bulimia Nervosa has\npatterns of binge eating followed by vomiting and laxative abuse. Either way the\nrelationship with food is changed and are\noften due to feelings that make the affected person unhappy or depressed. It may\nbe associated with sadness, guilt, loss,\nfear or anger.\nIt is difficult to say how many people in\nthe UK are affected by an eating disorder.\nMany go undiagnosed but it is believed\nthat one in every hundred young women\nare affected by Bulimia and a smaller, but\nstill significant, number by anorexia. The\nRoyal College of Psychiatry estimated in\n1992 that at any one time 60,000 individuals were receiving treatment for an\nAnorexia or Bulimia. Currently, the Eating\nDisorder Association believes the figure\nto be more likely 90,000, with many more\nundiagnosed, particularly those with Anorexia Nervosa.\nPhysical signs of Anorexia can include\nsevere weight loss, dizziness, const ipa tion, poor circulation (feeling cold) and\nsleep difficulties. Women also experience\nthe stopping of periods, which usually\nreturns once the starving has halted.\nOften Anorexics will experience osteoporosis (thinning of the bones).\nPsychologically there is depression, mood\nswings, intense fear of gaining weight\nand a distorted perception of body weight\nand shape. Behaviourally those affected\nwill wear baggy clothes, exercise excessively, lie about eating meals and will\ndeny any problems associated.\nBulimia\nHere physical signs can include sore\nthroats, repeated mouth infections,\ndry/poor skin and sleep difficulties.\nPeriods don't stop, but can be irregular.\nDue to the vomiting, those with Bulimia\noften have poor teeth and will avoid\ngoing to the dentist. Psychologically\nthose affected feel depressed, and exhibit\nmood swings and highly emotional\nbehaviour, which is caused by the body\nreacting to the consumption of large\namounts of food followed by vomiting or\ntaking laxatives.\nIf you feel you do have a problem the first\nstep (slightly clich ed) is to recognise it.\nFrom here there must be a genuine desire\nto get better, possibly altering your\nlifestyle, behaviour and circumstances.\nThe reason for your problem also has to\nbe investigated and changes made here\nas well as re-shaping your ideas about\nfood and weight. Remember, though, you\nare not alone. Medical advice should be\nsought and speaking to a counsellor could\nbe extremely important especially with\nlook at the reasons for the eating disorder.\nLosing weight\nIf you wish to or need to lose weight for\nhealth reasons its best to do it via a controlled programme. Begin with cutting\nout the crap in your diet; junk food, fatty\ncakes, chocolate; replacing with additional fruit and vegetables. Take additional\nexercise, and build up slowly. Remember\nyou can speak to your doctor about advice\non your diet and changes to your life that\nyou can make\nEating Disorder Association Helpline01603 621414 (weekdays 9am to 6.30pm). David\n\n"
