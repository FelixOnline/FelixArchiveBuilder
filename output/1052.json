    "content": "simon baker\nJarvis Cocker. Jarvis Cocker. Ah,\nthe mere mention of the man's name fills the heart with joy! His\nactions at the Brits, the most insipid\nback-slapping jolly of the year, may\nnot have been seen by many people\nthanks to the gutless folk of TTV,\nbut have done more to raise him to P cult status than even the truly bril1liant 'Different Class.'I said a con- ' ?\npie of weeks ago that the most dis- IB? lP*'V~f tasteful piece of television likely to be screened\nthis decade was that concerning the American\ntoddler beauty pageants. Mais non, mes amis.\nMichael Jackson's 'performance' was truly sick.\nIt was cheap, tacky, blasphemous and deeply\noffensive. Portraying himself as the second\nMessiah, healing by the laying on of hands was\ndisgusting, and the children's presence was\nalmost as distasteful as the citation of unparalleled syco phan cy read out by Bob Geldof, a man\nof whom we all expect better. What made it\ntruly hilarious however, was the way that the\nman Cocker stole all the headlines from this\nnasty piece of transatlantic mediocrity by jumping on stage. As for Jackson moaning' about the\nchildren that were injured, apparently by security guards, it is the best case of the pot calling the\nkettle black (or should that be white?) I have\never seen. Allegedly.\nThe Scott Report has generated almost its\nown weight in newspaper articles and despite\nthe fact Sir Richard, who must have shares in a papier company, wrote bis detailed conclusions\nover 1806 pages (plus an appendix of about 500\npages and a large index), everyone seems to have\ncome to a completely different one. Having\nactually trawled through the five volumes that\nmake the London phone book seem like\nGuiUsheet (in length not content, you under-stand), I'm afraid that a couple of heads must\nroll. To pre c is the report would take\nthe whole issue of Felix, so I 'll get to\nthe point. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the\nAttorney-General, was either\nincompetent or deliberately misled\nministers by advising them wrongly\nover the use of Public Interest\nImmunity Certificates. Further , he\ndid not involve himself personally\nwhen Michael Heseltine expressed\ngrave doubts about the actions he\nwas effectively forced to take. As a awy er, Lyell should have got\ninvolved, and for this reason he should resign.\nThe case of William Waldegrave is a little\nless clear. Scott says that 'Mr Waldegrave knew,\nfirst hand, the facts that, in my opinion, rendered\nthe \"no change in policy [over defence equipment exports]\" statement untrue' yet 'I did not\nreceive the impression of any insincerity on his\npart giving me the evidence he did.' The implication is of incompetence rather than deception.\nWhether this is a case for resignation is a difficult\none that should be decided by him and the\nPrime Minister. But I don't fancy his chances.\nI have restrained myself for a few weeks,\nnot saying a thing, but I cannot go on. The BMS\nfiasco goes from strength to strength. One wonders what is keeping the poor dears at the borough council so busy. The solution is, in exchange\nfor approval, to offer to make Imperial College\nRoad a public highway and let them stick parking meters along it. Do that and it'll be sorted by\ntea time. Of Ian Caldwell, who is still not 'wor-ried about this latest setback', I am in awe. What\nwould worry this man? Imperial is very lucky to\nhave such a cool, level-headed man working for\nus. If I had his job, I would be on tranquillisers by\nnow. And then there is Schal Project\nManagement. Less charitable souls than myself\nwill begin to wonder if this is a contradiction in\nterms. Somebody somewhere must be very\nuncomfortable.\nbook - rebel heartS bax,, R,t \u2014\nThis book examines the Northern Ireland troubles and the thinking behind the IRA. Kevin\nToolis is a journalist who has researched his subject over many years, gaining the confidence of\nthe upper echelons of the IRA, speaking to its\nleader and an IRA informer, amongst others. The\ncontacts have enabled Toolis to produce a perceptive and fascinating work.\nHe starts by outlining the republican background from which the IRA grew, and then\nworks deeper and deeper into the structure of\nthe organisation. We see the disdain for the\nProtestants who \"get all the jobs\" and the huge\nhate for the RUC and British crown \"oppressors\". It is felt (and is probably true) that the\n\"occupying\" British Army have cold-blooded ly murdered suspected enemies - \"They try to use\nthe civilian population as shields...You do not\nhave to be a Republican or even a Nationalist to\nbe murdered. There is no such thing as impartiality of law and order in this area.\"\nThe most revealing and chilling parts of this\nbook come when Toolis is interviewing the IRA\nleaders: within their own little world, they seem\nperfectly rational. However, their world is so isolated that to most others their actions seem\nanathema. Toolis is also allowed to hear the last\ntaped confession of an IRA informer, recorded\nminutes before he was killed. After a while Toolis\nadmits that the thousands of deaths inflicted\nbecome a blur - no one person is remembered\nand it feels as if they died for nothing.\nToolis writes an incredibly revealing account\nwhich flows surprisingly well and is an excellent\nread. He has explored the subject in such depth\nand has such contacts that this could well be\ndescribed as an authoritative masterwork. If you\nalways wondered what the IRA were about, this\nbook is superbly en kg h ten ing. With the recent\ncollapse of the ceasefire and the IRA back in the\nnews, it is more relevant than ever.\n\n"

Neil O 'Shaughnessy,\nSenior Union Steward, cited his\nplans to better publicise Clubs &\nSocieties using the five major student publications. The candidates were also asked whether\ntheir past associations with specific clubs might impinge on their\nimpartiality, if elected.\nPiers Williams, Pub Board\nChair and the only candidate for\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices), was described by his\nproposer as \"level headed and\nclued-up\", and managed to bring\nsome levity to the evening. He\nwas questioned at length regarding his hair-dying habits, denying\nrumours that this had ceased in a search for credibility. Piers did\nface some serious questions,\npromising to steer ICU through\nits 'financial turning point' given\nthe recent cuts.\nThe three candidates for the\nICU Presidency, Eric Allsop,\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN Sticky: The candidate for Felix editor and Print Unit manager, Alex\nFeakes, and his proposer Mark Baker were particularly well-flan ned to appease the wrath of St Mary's at the hustings on Wednesday.\n(Current ICU council chair and\nMechEng PG), Mark Bridge\n(Felix news-writer and chemistry\nUG) and Luke Morales (Ents DJ\nand Biology PG) were grilled\nextensively on numerous topics.\nLuke and Eric advocated staying\nout of the NUS whereas Mark\nappeared to support affiliation.\nTheir political views were also\nscrutinised though they all\nappeared to back 'New\nSolutions', a non-NUS affiliated\npressure group proposing alternatives to student funding.\nThe candidates all seemed to\nbe keeping their spirits up after\nrigorous treatment at the hands\nof St Mary's on Wednesday. \"I 've\ndrunk piss before and I'm sure\nI 'll drink it again in the future,\"\ncommented Eric Allsop.\nNew Election is also standing\nfor all posts, if another poll next\nterm is a better option than any\nof the candidates. Voting will\ntake place in departments around\nSouth Kensington, Paddington\nand Silwood Park sites next\nMonday and Tuesday.\nSir Ron to\nInvestigate\nBY DIPAK GHOSH\nThe Government's favourite\neducation trouble-shooter, Sir\nRon Dearing, is to carry out a thorough review of the Higher\nEducation sector. According to a recent ministerial announce-ment, Sir Ron's enquiry will take\nabout 12 months, with the final\nreport widely predicted to criticise provisions in the Bill, and\nrecommend yet another student\nfunding mechanism.\nThis has triggered some of\nthe members of the House of\nLords to describe the Student\nLoans. Bill as a 'dead duck'.\nDuring the debate which preceded its second reading in the\nUpper Chamber on Monday, a large number of peers called for\nGillian Shepherd, Education and\nEmployment Minister, to scrap\nthe Student Loans Bill alto get h er.\nOne detractor was Lord\nMorris of Castle Morris who\ncautioned the Government\nagainst imposing the Bill. \"Even\nat this late stage, withdraw it.\nScrap it. Take the advice of the\ngood old English proverb: if at\nfirst you don't succeed - give\nup'.\", he pleaded.\nNew medical syllabus leaves students in the dark\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nImperial College authorities\nacknowledged last week that the\nsyllabus for the Imperial College\nSchool of Medicine's( ICSM)\ndegree is not ready, leaving current students ignorant of the content of the later years of their\ncourse. The course is being overhauled in preparation for the\nmerger of Charing Cross and\nWestminster and St Mary's medical schools in 1998, and changes\nin it could mean less choice for\nthe students.\nThe content of the new\ndegree's curriculum has been\nthrashed out at numerous working parties and discussion groups,\nyet important elements of the\ncourse's structure remain un re solved, particularly the new clinical aspects. Professor Edwards,\nPrincipal of the ICSM, explained\nthat the review of the degree was\nimplemented because of a decision by the General Medical\nCouncil's education committee\nto alter how doctors are trained.\nHe stressed that \"we can't resist\nthis change,\" and that it was\nimportant that students would\nnot be disadvantaged by the\nchange.\nLouise Moran, Education\nRepresentative of St Mary's Union, told Felix that medical\nstudents are pleased with the\ncontent of the new degree,\ndescribing it as 'good, but tough'\nbut she pointed out that the plans\nwere not finalised. This raised\nconcerns that the October 1998\nintake of students would be used\nas \"guinea pigs\" for the course\nwithout any compensating reduction in workload for the extra\nclinical work in the new degree's first year. She said they had been\ntold that the relocation of the\nschool to the South Kensington\nsite would mean that there would\nbe \"not as much choice, and a more difficult course.\"\nIn answer to this, Professor\nEdwards said that the switch over\nto the new course in 1998 would\nhappen for all the years, and that\nthere had been a \"decrease in factual content\" and an \"increase in\nself learning\" (around a core curriculum that all students would\nbe taught.\nThe prospectus for the\ncourse is currently being pre-pared,, and Professor Edwards\nexpressed the opinion that the\nchanges for the course should be\nfinalised \"as quickly as possible, if\nnot this year\" in order for them\nto be publicised. However, he\nadmitted that some very basic\nthings, such as the convergence\nof the entry criteria for Charing\nCross and St Mary's, have not\nbeen fully cleared up, though\nfunding for the extra year which\nthe new degree entails has been\nsecured.\nLouise agreed that the funding issue had been worked out to\neveryone's satisfaction, but\nrepeated that students are\nunhappy with the timetable for\nthe implementation of the new\nsyllabus. She hoped that they\n\"would sort it out before the\ncourse starts.\"\n\n"

    "content": "Russian crystal technology has been used in a joint research effort at \u2022\nImperial College to develop an ingenious laser with eye surgery potential. > 1 \"VS\nJames Porteous reports on some focused work in the Blackett Laboratory. \u2014\nCrystal Laser Vision\nIt is often the case in science that\nresearchers inadvertently 'discover'\nimportant new ideas and techniques\nwhile searching for the answers to questions about something entirely different. In fact,\nwe owe much of the growth and diversification\nof tecl in ology to such accidental revelations. A case in point is an on-going collaboration\nbetween Russian and Imperial College scientists. While looking at the properties of new\nsemi-conducting materials they realised that a unique Russian crystal and a sliver of semi-con-duct or can be used to build an unusually cheap\nand compact laser with the potential to be used\nin corrective eye surgery.\nThe focus of the excitement is an extremely pure garnet crystal, grown meticulously in a laboratory at the General Physics Institute in\nMoscow and brought to London to be harnessed\nto the equipment of the Solid State\nExperimental Research Group at Imperial\nCollege. Made up of the elements erbium and\nchromium, the crystal is special because it\nabsorbs and emits near infra red light at the\nunique wavelength of about 2.98 microns. Using\nthe crystal as a light 'generator', the combined\nteam developed a laser to test the light emitting\nproperties of semi-conducting material at\nImperial College. The happy spin-off from\ntheir research was the realisation that they\nhad engineered a laser which, with its\nparticular wavelength and short, accurate pulses, would be ideal for use in\ndelicate eye surgery.\nAt nearly three microns, the\nlaser's near infra red wavelength\ncorresponds to the pea\nwater's light abs or pti or spectrum. Because h umar tissue is mostly water, it\nmeans the laser does\nnot penetrate deeply\ninto tissue, but is\ninstead absorbed\nalmost immediately at a very thin depth.\n\"It's quite amazing to watch\" said Dr. Chris\nPhillips of the Department of Physics at Imperial\nCollege. \"If you put your hand in front of the\nlaser, it will burn a tiny hole in your hand, but\nyou can't actually feel that hole\nbecause the penetration depth is wv \u00ab\nabout five microns and the nerves in ^k.1 your hand are deeper than that. You\ncan effectively tattoo your hand and\nnot feel a thing. Consequently healing\noccurs in just a couple of days.\" In eye\nsurgery, where precision and minimal\ndamage are imperative, this new\nRussian crystal laser has ideal properties and very exciting potential.\nAlthough laser technology is now\nwidely applied in eye surgery, the crystal laser has some special bonuses that\nshould make both technology companies and op thal mo logi sts itchy with\nexpectation. An ultra violet laser has\nalready been developed in the U.S. for an eye surgery technique called\nphoto-refractive ke rate c to my, or\nPRK, which treats mild degrees of\nnearsightedness by shaving microscopic layers off the cornea to change\nits shape and, therefore, alter the focal\npoint of light on the retina.\nThe PRK technique removes thin\nlayers of the cornea by d is mp ting the\nchemical bonds between tissue mole-cu les, but the new crystal laser can\npotentially do the same job, better.\nWith its very short (80 milk on mil-lion th s of a second) and very intense\n(10 million watts) pulses of light, the laser\ncan remove tissue just a few microns thick\nwithout affecting the chemical structure\nof surrounding tissue or damaging\nnerves. The real magic of the crystal\nas er light is its unusually shallow\npenetration of the eye compared to\nother ultra violet and infra red\nlasers which require local anaesthesia. There is a possibility\nthat surgery with this new\nshallow' laser may not\neven need anaesthetic\nhelp, but aside from\nthat potential in nova tion, the laser's special\ncharacteristics mean it\ncould be easily employed in eye surgery other\nthan for corneal shaping.\nBut where does the sliver of semi-con duc tor come into the story? Answer: as an extra\npiece of clever innovation which not only gives\nthe new laser its impressive pulses, but which\ncould actually revolution is e how lasers are engi-Chris Phillips (above) and Kostya Vodopyanov are part of\nthe Solid State Experimental Research Group in the\nBlackett Laboratory, Department of Physics.\nnee red. The Russian and Imperial College\nresearch team developing the laser technology\nhave patented the use of a semi-conductor\n'wafer', just a few atoms thick, which is a substitute for the expensive and bulky electronic\nequipment currently used to pulse laser beams.\nThe wafer which is made from indium and\narsenic, and grown atom by atom at Imperial\nCollege, acts as a kind of light 'valve' or shutter,\nby only emitting light of a certain wavelength. As\nlight of increasing intensity is shone through the\ncrystal and onto the wafer, it suddenly becomes\ntransparent and emits light for just 80 million-millionths of a second before 'shutting' again,\ncreating a pulse of intense, near infra red light.\nTrains of these pulses make up the beam which\nis then amplified by mirrors to laser intensity.\nAccording to Dr. Chris Phillips the crystal\nand semi-conductor wafer combination is beautifully simple conceptually and very efficient in\npractice. It means a potential end to very expensive \"garage-sized\" lasers, and because it is all\nsolid state material rather than gas or liquid tech-no logy, consistency and reliability are built in.\n\n"

This\nmeant serious wind, so did we have sails small\nenough for everyone?\nAfter arriving at our rented house on the\nbeach, we ran across the sand dunes to the\nnearest pub to meet up with Nottingham\nUniversity's windsurfing club. The\nNottingham lot had arrived on Thursday\nnight and had already had a chance to size up\nthe conditions.

Thanks must go to Rob, who drove\na fair portion of the way home.\nThe club has some racing events organised for the future and would like to get in\ncontact with people who can race a long and\nshort board in the top division (those who\nhave sound water starting abilities and can\nhold down big sails).

How are we\ngonna make it for another thousand years, for\nChrissake?\"\nRalph Fiennes plays Lenny Nero, an ex-cop\nand dealer in SQUIDs - Superconducting Quantum Interface Devices - playback versions of\npeople's experiences. These are held on digital\ndisc, and when played back allow the user not\nonly to see and hear, but also to feel every single\nevent. Whatever you want - sex, violence or\nthrills - Lenny will get it for you. Anything, that\nis, except blackjacks' - the SQUID equivalent of\nsnuff movies, which become the illegal drug of\nchoice for many.\nSet in Los Angeles, where the streets are\neven now rife with gang warfare and police\ncheckpoints, the film paints a bleak picture of a future which could be reality in only three years'\ntime. The execution-style murder of Jeriko One\n(Glenn Plummer), a rap star and race rights\nactivist, pushes the tension on the streets to an\nall-time high. Through a series of anonymous\nplayback clips showing the murder of J eriko One\nand a friend of his, Lenny becomes inextricably\ninvolved in a chain of events which threaten his\nown life, but far more important to Lenny is the\npossible danger to Faith (Juliette Lewis), a former girlfriend. Lenny is still in love with Faith,\nnow a successful singer (Lewis does a pretty\ngood job of covering PJ Harvey's 'Rid Of Me'\nand Hardly Wait'), but Faith no longer has any\nfeelings for him. She has moved on with her life,\nleaving him with only a bottle of vodka and a shoe box full of playback clips of their time\ntogether. It is up to Lenny, with the help of Mace\n(Angela Bassett), to solve the connection\nbetween the two murders while keeping their\nlives intact.\nStrange Days portrays a dark, often shocking vision of civilisation at the end of the millen-niu m.A soundtrack which contains Deep\nForest, Skunk Anansie, Tricky and plenty of rap\nenhances the feelings of extreme unrest on the\nstreets.\nDirected by Kathryn Bigelow {Point Break\nand Blue Steel) and written by James Cameron\n(The Terminator, Aliens and True Lies), this\ncontains some exhilarating action scenes and\nstunts, some unexpected twists in the storyline\nand excellent acting by Fiennes, Bassett and\nLewis.

That singular animal who is actually a bit\n- well - creative?\nIf you are, then\nphoenix needs you!\nphoenix is the annual,\narts publication of IC,\nand is your chance to get your work distributed to the poor, culture-starved masses.\nBut what sort of art are we talking about\nhere? Well, just about any! This year we're\ntaking prose, poetry, stories, artwork, animations, audio, video, interactive works, and\nalmost anything else we could distribute!\nDon't let the medium restrict you - be creative and just express yourself.\nThe suggested theme is 'Manipulation' -feel free to interpret it as you wish or ignore\nit completely, it's just there to provide inspiration if you need it.\nThis time the editors are Mark and\nJeremy - you can reach us via the Felix\npigeon holes, by phoning or faxing 58072, or\ne mailing m lt bl@ doc.ic.ac.uk or the soon-to-be-set-up phoenix e mail account.\nSo, if you feel inspired or already have\nsome work you want to share with the world,\ndrop in for a chat or even an argument -either is fine by us!\nJust one restriction - we'd like any work\nin by the end of this term, 22 March. If this\nis no good then come and talk to us, you\nmight be in luck...\nWargaming\nGo into any good hobby or games store these\ndays and more than likely you'll be confronted by a huge range of playing card-size packs.\nThis is the new world of Customisable Card\nGames (or CCG s to those in the know). The\nrange of themes is huge: there are games\nbased on films, TV series (I think you can\nguess which ones I'm referring to), games\nand books, and others along more fantastic al lines - the list goes on and on. At the rate at\nwhich new games are becoming available, the\nlist will soon top one hundred.\nCCG s work on the principle of having\nan initial set of over 300 cards, which are randomly spread though packs. Most of the really useful cards are 'rare cards', which means\nthat you only get 2-6 (depending on the\ngame) in a starter pack of 60 cards (\u00a36 or\nupwards); or 1-2 in a booster pack of 8-15\ncards (\u00a32). There are also common and\nuncommon cards, with equal numbers of\nrare, uncommon and common cards in a set.\nOnce you think you've got a strong\nenough deck to compete, the game itself\ninvolves defeating your opponent's deck one\nway or another, using the cards properties to\nwhittle away your opponent's strength while\ndefending your own.\nIf you want to collect a set and have a few duplicate rare cards, there are plenty of\npeople to trade cards with. Several cards of\ndifferent rarity can change hands at one go,\nso you need a razor-sharp mind to make the\nbest deals! If there's no one around to swap\nwith, you could always put an advert on the\nthe Internet: the newsgroup rec.games.tr ad ing-cards.marketplace is a good place to start\ntrading or buying cards. Be careful when buy-ing, as most deals come from the US and\ninvolve dollars. Some cards can be rather\nexpensive; a Black Lotus (from the\nMagicThe Gathering set), now out of print,\nwill sell for about \u00a3150. Even rare cards\nwhich are still in print, such as a Darth Vader\n(from the Star Wars set) can go for around\n\u00a335, and it's only been available 5 weeks!\nShould any of you start playing aCC G,I'm looking for a Darth Vader at the\nmoment! If you already play a CCG then\ncome to Wargames club - we have several\nMagic, Star Wars, Middle Earth and Star\nTrek:TNG players.\n\n"

This soundtrack accomplishes that with\nample to\nspare, allowing\nus to\nenjoy some of\nthe best\nof British\nmusic, with exclusive\ntunes from the\nlikes of\nPulp, Blur, Sleeper, Leftfield and Primal Scream\n(read the posters).\n'Trainspotting' takes the unique atmosphere\nof a superb movie and some diverse and brilliantly creative music along for the ride.

    "content": "play: 1 9 5 3 d lire sar nii el It's not a new story: Craig Raine has updated\nRacine's Andromaque, which in turn was adapted from Andromache by Euripides. However\nthis version is set in a world in which England\nsurrendered the second World War. Hitler is still\nalive and Mussolini's son is King of Italy.\nThe sumptuous Art Deco palace of the\nItalian King is the setting for this tragedy. One of\nVittorio Mussolini's spoils of the war is Annette\nLeSkye, the Jewish English Queen, whom he\nhas installed in the palace, but with her young\nson also present placed under lock and key.\nElitler's envoy, Orestes, arrives in Rome to\nretrieve the boy for the Fiihrer, but Orestes is in\nlove with the German Princess Ira who loves\nVittorio. Vittorio is betrothed to Ira for the good\nof the Axis Powers, but he's really in love with\nLeSkye.\nEmma Fielding is distinguished as the\nmanipulative and spoilt Princess Ira and Jason\nIsaacs' boxing and pool playing Vittorio is played\nwith an aggression which would make him feel\nat home in the East End gangland.\nThe play is not quite as gripping as it could\nbe, this is not a fault of the director, Patrick\nMarber (writer of Dealers Choice, and collaborator with Steve Coogan) or the writer,\nwho introduced some very interesting metaphors in the modem English\nverse, but of Racine's original. Over\none half of the play is used in setting\nthe background whereas the tragic\nending is almost brushed over. One\npossibility could be to play without an\ninterval so keeping the dramatic con-t inuit y. Otherwise this is a finely cast\nplay with an interesting interpretation\nof how the second half of the twentieth century may have evolved.\nplay - les enfants du\nparadis :Iaire Samuel\nThere has been much criticism of Simon\nCallow's adaptation of the classic French film,\nLes Enfants du Paradis, managing to create a four\nhour stage production from a three hour movie.\nHaving not seen he original, which has been\nvoted the best French film ever made, by the\nFrench Film Academy, I can not comment on\nwhether the spirit of the film has been captured\non the stage but only on the play itself.\nThis is a complex love story, definitely not a boy meets girl, all in love, live happily ever after\nscenario, but considers the many forms which\nlove can take and means of acquiring it. The narrative is centred around Garance, the beautiful\nyoung actress and the theatre where she, the\nebullient actor Frederick Lemaitre and the\nmime artist Baptiste work, and how their lives\nare intertwined with that of an assassin\nLacenaire.\nThe difficulties on transposing a film to the\nstage have been mostly overcome by a giant\nI aime ida01713594404: ml XS fc jt l;h pf:99! wv nd liam s theatre 0171 369\nsky lip tn ipn in Vn. ^ P\" \u00bb**:\nrevolving stage as the central theatre, which\nunfortunately did tend to squeak and rattle a bit,\nand with the atmospheric music and lighting,\nprovided a dark backdrop of early nineteenth\ncentury Paris.\nThe initial scene setting was a bit slow, but\nthe play soon came to life with the confrontation\nbetween the innocent Baptiste and evil\nLacenaire over possession of Garance. Rupert\nGraves is not quite the great Pierrot he is meant\nto portray but admirably acquits himself in the\ntheatre mime shows that interspersed the play,\ntheir own theme complementing the plot.\nIncluding, in the only spoken play-within-play, a memorable performance of how not to perform\nOthello. The dark, subversive Lacenaire, played\nsuperbly by Joseph Fiennes (Ralph's younger\nbrother) with aristocratic poise in a long black\nflock coat and top hat is the star player, but\nbeware of walking canes. Although this is not a truly great production, it still remains a beautiful\nstory, so do not be deterred by its length, and it\ndefinitely does not deserve all the slating it has\nreceived in the press.\n.. . .\nan ideal husband\n/ 71 369'\n7 -f^ps tJ ik^f}17192S7616:u fd; Hllll\n\n"

To me\nthey were merely Slayer-wannabes with a fine\nline in crass, bordering-on-the-Satanic lyrics.\n1993's million-plus selling album, 'Chaos A.D.', however, was much more promising, particularly\nthe likes of 'Refuse/Resist' which moved away\nfrom the speed and the stupidity and into mid-paced, controlled power. Now, with their sixth\nalbum, Sepultura have produced a work of stunning cohesion and breathtaking brutality.\nQuite simply, 'Roots' is heavier than an elephant with a weight problem and is consequently\nnot for the migraine-afflicted. Opener and top 20\nsingle, 'Roots Bloody Roots', speaks for the whole\nalbum with its snarling, rabid guitars, 'pour some\nhot whisky down my larynx and then mb it with\nsandpaper' vocals, and Latin American tribal\nd mm ming. The latter musical element is a conscious decision on the band's part as they have\nsought to capture some of the ethos of their\nhomeland amidst their modem, metallic fury\n(hence the album title). Luckily for them, and for\nus, it has worked a treat.\n'Ratamahatta' is a glorious rush that sees\nSepultura vocalist, Max Cavelera, and Brazilian\npercussionist, Carlinhos Brown, exchanging furious Portuguese lyrics. If you can resist jumping up\nand down to the manic percussion and razor-sharp guitars then you're... well, probably just a less excitable and more sensible person than I am.\nGoing back to their roots doesn't just mean\nbludgeoning us though. 'Itsari' is an acoustic number that was recorded with the Xavante tribe in\nthe Amazon jungle. It is certainly more than a mere curio and serves as an atmospheric breather\nthat builds from a delicate intro to an intense yet\nsensitive finale. In many ways, the claustrophobia\nthat the track invokes makes this song 'heavier'\nthan all of the other, considerably louder, songs on\nthe album.\nSepultura have successfully come up with a sixth album that sounds as fresh as if it were their\nfirst, and that incorporates their cultural heritage\nin a natural and plain angry sound. As far as I'm concerned, this is the only jungle music worth\nbothering with... (8)\n-album: st. germain -boulevards.pulaski\nThe man behind St. Germain, Ludovic Navarre,\nis a reclusive French misanthrope who doesn't believe in setting himself easy tasks - to wit, fusing\ndeep house beats with late-night, jazzy atmospheric s. This seemingly perverse notion should be\ndoomed to failure since jazz and house are pretty\nmuch polar music styles - one relies on musical\nfreedom and improvisation, where mistakes are\nintegrated into the whole, while the other uses\nrigid beats and synthesised sounds to create a surface perfection. That it isn'ta failure is a testament to Navarre's unique talent.\n'Deep In It' opens in style, a glorious, laid-back groove overlaid with all the basic jazz vibes,\nsoulful piano, the works. 'Thank U Mum (4\nEverything You Did)', despite the appa ling title, is\neven better - a deep bass-line, shimmering backing and mysterious vocals combining to produce\nthe warmest sound imaginable. Mummy must be\nproud.\nIt's not all wine and roses, though. 'Street\nLove' falls into the old jazz trap of being, well, bor-ing, while 'Dub Experience IT is nothing more\nthan a pleasant bit of light dub-reggae, which is as\nout of place as you'd imagine.\nMinor irritations aside though, this is a unique, soulful and very cool album. (8)\n-gig: echo belly i lucas\nTo expectant applause, Echobelly bound onto\nstage and go straight for the tunes. There's no\nsigns of any arrogant posturing or gigantic egos\nhere.\nWhat hits you first and foremost is the music.\nBut, like the advert for Granary, if you 're male and\nheterosexual you cannot fail to miss the protagonist of the proceedings. In this case it's Sonya\nAurora Madan. Her sub dy effusive sexuality\nexpresses itself in some of the kindest and quirkiest moves. And though she is naturally under stat ed, paradoxically the sheer energy and exuberance of the music comes through her as if she was\nthe vessel for it's oh-so-slightly screwed-up\nmelodies.\nMadan has an angelic voice, but unlike that of\na choirboy, there is a certain knowing there, which\nshe is totally un-self-conscious of. And, like a shooting star in a starry sky, she stands out.\nIt was a storming gig. What more can I say?\n\n"

    "content": "With a fair quantity of alcohol inside us both a two month \"adventure\" during the summer\nseemed like a fantastic idea. Meet new people,\nsee new sights, sample foreign culture and cui-sine, be threatened with deportation, get driven\nround Hungary by an Austrian art smuggler,\nand discover you suffer from vertigo halfway\nup the highest mountain in Poland. Travel. It\nbroadens the mind. It also makes you smell.\nWe decided on Eastern Europe largely\nbecause it was cheap (where else can you get top\nquality wine for 7pa glass served by the man\nwho made it, or \"THE-BEST-ICE-CREAM-IN-THE-WORLD\" for 8pa scoop?). It's also close\nto home. Close, but still far enough away to\nrequire a24 hour coach journey: the coach journey from hell. Our coach proclaimed itself to be\nthe property of the Czech National Hockey\nteam, but it apparently also moonlights as the\nNational Express service from Victoria to\nPrague. Judging by the rather fetching upholstered chairs, I suspect the Czechs play in pur-ple, and that the average player is around 3ft6 in in order to be seated comfortably in the \"luxurious reclining seats\". It was only an extra 20 quid\nto fly, but we were on a budget.\nThe plan was to work our way up through\nPoland and the Baltic States, then head back\ndown to Hungary, up to Slovakia before making\nour way back to Prague. We saw a lot in those\ntwo months. Much of what was formely Soviet\nBlock is still relatively untouched by capitalism\nand stereotypes of grim, industrial landscapes are\ncomplimented by unspoilt towns and villages\nwhere people seem genuinely intrigued by west-em visitors. \"You just want to look around the\ncountry and then go home?\" asked one bemused\nUkranian we met on a train.\nSome events stick out in the mind more\nthan others. Refusal to pay a bill in a Lithuanian\nrestaurant which tried to charge us 100 Lits (a third of a months wages for a Lithuanianenough to buy 50kg of bananas. Lithuanians are\nobsessed by bananas) for a salad we hadn't even\ngets deported\nfrom Lithuania\nordered resulted in armed members of the local\nconstabulary informing us that if we didn't pay\nup immediately we would be deported that\nevening. That was in the first week.\nMemories of the three days spent in the\nPolish Tartras will be with me for ever. I really\nshould have taken a change of T shirt. After 72\nhours in the same clothes, day and night (we did-n't realise that half of Poland's youth come to the\nTartras every year and the chances of a bed or\nshower are non existent) things were a tad\nunpleasant. My companion's discovery, made at\nseveral thousand feet above sea-level, that she\nhas a disabling fear of heights was an interesting\naddition to the \"experience\", but the sheer beauty of the landscape, the fresh air, and the satisfaction of looking back and saying \"I did it\" more\nthan compensated.\nThen there were the people: we met an\nAustrian in a pizza restaurant who offered to take\nus to our next destination. He later confessed he\nsmuggled rare postcards to sell back home for an\noutrageous profit, producing a holdall stuffed full\nof forged dollar bills. Then there was the elderly\nLithuanian lady who stopped to tell us, in sign\nlanguage, about the night the Soviet troops\nstormed the parliament at the start of the revolution. As we examined the remains of the bara-cade s the citizens of Vilnius had erected, it\nemerged that she had been there. And I mustn't forget the restauranteur who spoke dod gy English and in translating the menu offered us\n\"bollocks\" and \"breasts\". Quite.\nTwo months were spent in fairly random\nwandering through the unknown, not knowing\nwhere we were going to sleep, unsure of what\nexactly we were eating, being confused by the\nranting s of ticket collecters, customs officers and\narmed policemen, and loving every minute of it.\nGraham Trevitt\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY MARCH 1 ST 1 9 9 6 . THREE\nBicycle Thefts Cause Alarm\nBY DIPAK GHOSH\nA spate of bicycle thefts around\nCollege has triggered the installation of closed circuit television\ncameras to counter the growing\nmenace posed by criminals.\nThe easily accessible sheds\nbeside RCS I have been the most\nregularly hit, but the Southside,\nMechanical Engineering and\nMain Library sites have not\nescaped. One thief was caught\nlast week in the act of stealing a bike, by an Imperial College\nSecurity guard, and was subsequently handed over to the\npolice. Despite the large number\nof incidents, this was only the\nsecond time since October that a thief has been caught stealing\nbicycles.\nThe recent surge in bike\nthefts has meant that the need\nfor routine patrols of bike sheds\nhas become a priority. Plain\nclothes police and IC security\nstaff routinely patrol the bike\nsheds to deter potential culprits.\nThis clearly has had limited success so far, suggesting that the\nthefts have been due to a well\norganised'group.\nClosed Circuit TV( CCTV)\ncameras have been purchased by\nCollege to cover the walkway\narea in between the Mechanical\nEngineering, Electrical Engineering and the RSM. There are\nalso plans to introduce similar\ncameras around the main library,\none of the largest bicycle storing\nareas, though this is subject to\nthe availability of funds.\nKeith Reynolds, College's Head of Security, emphasised\nthat the main problem in procuring more cameras is their cost.\n\"Last year we concentrated on\ncomputer security - upgrade of\nbike security is dependent on the\nbudget,\" Mr Reynolds insisted.\nHe defended Security's current\nperformance saying, \"It would be\nideal if there was one central site\nfor parking bikes, but at the\nmoment there are all scattered\nabout thus making it difficult to\nmonitor.\"\nMr Reynolds also said that\nthe bike shed for the new\nBiomedical Sciences has not been\nfully integrated into the plans.\n\u2022 The current provisional proposal\nis to locate it in the walkway,\nthough this will not be enough to\naccommodate all the bicycles\nthat will be coming along with\nthe medical students.\nWith CCTV s likely to be\ninstalled in the walkway area\nduring the next three or four\nweeks, Mr Reynolds advises students worried about security to\npark their bikes there.\nPHOTO: IVAN CHAN\nOn Tuesday Imperial College security apprehended a thief stealing\na bicycle, but as the owner has yet to come forward, the police have\nbeen unable to press charges. Anyone who lost a bike at the beginning of the week should contact Sherfield security (extension\n58900.)\nEnglish Heritage to decide on BMS plans today\nBY TIM ST CLAIR\nEnglish Heritage (EH) will meet\ntoday to decide whether to give\ntheir support to the plans for the\nnew Biomedical Science (BMS)\ncomplex. They will make a recommendation to Kensington and\nChelsea Borough Council\n(K& CBC) in time for the next\nplanning meeting, scheduled for\nWednesday of next week.\nRepresentatives from English\nHeritage came to Imperial\nCollege on Tuesday to examine'\nthe proposed construction site.\nThis inspection was followed by a meeting with architects from Sir\nNorman Foster and Partners\nwhere the plans for the BMS building were examined to assess\ntheir compatibility with the present architecture. It has emerged\nthat English Heritage's interest in\nthe much delayed demolition of\nRCS II building centres not on\nthe old building's preservation,\nbut on the suitability of the proposed BMS building for it's planned location adjacent to the\nQueen's Lawn.\nThe emphasis is on the long\nestablished designation of the\nScience Museum / RCS I area as\na conservation zone, and the fact\nthat the Queen's Tower is a listed building. This enforced\npreservation means that any\nmajor new construction work\naround the Queen's Lawn area\nmust fit in with the current environment. Ian Caldwell, Imperial\nCollege's Director of Estates,\nsaid that he didn't anticipate any\nmajor problems, though he\nadmitted that they may have to\n'tweak the plans a little.' He\nexplained that the building's 'off-shoots' would actually be 'architecturally joined up' to the RCS I building. It is possible that EH will give their consent to the\nBMS proposal with the proviso\nthat adjustments are made to the\narea where the buildings meet.\nThe RCS II building should\nhave been demolished by the\nmiddle of February but College\nplanners still insist that this time\ncan be made up. If EH give the\ngo-ahead as expected, demolition\nis set to 'go ahead almost instantaneously'. Mr Caldwell predicted that they would only end up\nbeing three weeks behind s ched ule, an amount he felt could be\neasily absorbed. \"We never\nexpected that getting planning\nwould be easy,\" he said.\nMr Caldwell does admit that\nEH should have been involved in\nthe planning process at a much\nearlier stage. He says that this\ndelay is due to 'a breakdown in\ncommunication'. Apparently this\noccurred when documents\nmailed in October by K&CB C were not received by EH, but he\ngenerously commented that they\nwere now being 'very helpful'.\n\n"
