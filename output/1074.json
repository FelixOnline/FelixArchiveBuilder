    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 10TH JANUARY LETTERS& EDITORIAL11 Letters to Felix Student Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Fe a kes/ Advertising Manager Mark Baker Dear All,\nOne of our Union's best services\n(and biggest earners) has just been\nlost. Do you care? Do you even\nknow? You should.\nThe ICU Bookstore used to make\naround \u00a370000 profit annually, all of\nwhich was directed back into the\nUnion, and ultimately to us - the stu-dents.\nIt also used to offer basic stationary and essentials at near-cost price,\nobviously to the direct benefit of all\na tlC. Further, it was one of the biggest\nand most successful Union-run\nstores in the UK, a fact that you\nwould expect College to have been\nproud of.\nYet the decision was made, somewhere 'up there' in the Sherfield\nbuilding to put the contract out to\ntender. Ignoring the facts above, and\ntypically not asking the customers of\nthe bookstore what their views are,\nICU was made to compete with the\ncountry's largest outlets. Despite\nsubmitting a competitive bid, the\nUnion came second and Waterstones\nwill operate from the new library\nsite.\nEven if ICU had been successful,\ntheir profitability would have been\nseverely dented by the high rent and\noverheads. They will continue to\noperate from the walkway site, but\nare prohibited from selling texts. The\nfuture of the store is uncertain, but\nwhatever the shop is used for (ideas\non a postcard) it will be impossible to\nrecoup the lost funds. Negotiations\nare underway for College compensation to the Union, but what type of\nsolution is this? \u00a370000 less for the\nCollege to spend, with no financial\ngain for the Union and large sums of\nmoney disappearing off the campus\nand into Waterstones' bank account.\nWhy?\nThis disregard of the Union and\nthe students needs seems to me to be\nsymptomatic of a fundamentally\nflawed 'us and them' attitude. The\nCollege decision-makers repeatedly\nact without researching or even\ninforming the student population.\nPlans are made out of sight, then presented imposingly so that we can\nonly accept or reject them, when\nboth students and staff should have\nbeen involved from the beginning.\nIt is a mistake to run IC as a prof-it-motivated research company. It is\na university and its prime function is\nto educate - without students it could\nnot exist at all. Yet, undergraduates\nespecially feel increasingly sidelined\nand that they are working for the college rather than the college working\nfor them. This matters! The bad news\nwill spread, and the appeal of universities with superior student facilities,\nsuch as Sheffield will grow. An IC\nthat is socially dead will not be academically great.\nICU owns none of it's buildings,\nand its continued existence relies on\nthe benevolence of College decision-makers rather than any legality or\nrights. The next few years will see\nmajor upheaval around the site, particularly in Beit Quad. Perhaps\nCollege will take the opportunity to\nact positively for the non-academic,\nnon-economic good of the students. I doubt it.\nJeremy Thomson, Phys 3.\nRight. Hands up all of you who\nknew that, (a) there was going to be\na new bookshop, (b) the franchise to\nrun it had been put out to tender by\nthe College, (c) the Union had been\ninvited to tender and had submitted a proposal, (d) the current bookstore\nwould no longer be allowed to sell\nbooks once the new shop opened, (e) the Union runs the current bookstore\nand (f) the surplus made on the\nbookstore is ploughed back into\nUnion services?\nI suspect that (a) and (e) might be\ncommon knowledge, (f) may have\nelicited a small response, but (b),(c) and (d) are largely unknown to the\nmajority of staff and students here.\nThis is through no fault of their own,\nthey are not involved with management of the shop, and have not been\nkept informed of the ramifications of\npossible outcomes of the tender.\nThe college general public are the\nultimate beneficiaries or losers of\nany trading activity on campus.\nPresumably they are interested in\nwhom supplied the products they\nbought and where their money will\ngo, but unfortunately have little idea.\nSome form of market research may\nhelped form a picture of how best a franchise holder might achieve \"aca-demi c book selling excellence\" in\nline with the Rector's wishes.\nThe committee appointed to\naward the tender might then have\nhad an expanded brief to consider\nthe peripheral benefits of a campus\nbookshop as well as a straight forward service based examination. A different, some might say less narrowly envisioned, set of criteria\nmight of led to a different decision,\nas the Deputy Rector might say.\nAnyway, enough carping on after\nthe horse has bolted etc. There arc,\nhowever, a few questions that remain to be answered over the conduct of the College toward the\nUnion with regards to the bookstore,\nand why the College is giving the\nimpression that its long term plans\ndiscount the Union as a valid,\nautonomous and vital part in this\ninstitution's reputation and the\nmaintenance of its member's well-being.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 10TH JANUARY\nWaterstone's awarded Bookstore tender\ncontinued from front page\nget, but conceded that there was\n\"...no denying that the extent to\nwhich the Union depends upon the\nGovernors has increased.\"\nWaterstone's academic book sales area manger Hereward Corbett\nrecounted being \"c huffed to bits\"\nupon hearing the news of their successful bid. Speculating as to why\nthey had won the tender, he drew\nattention to the \"powerful\" IT investment Waterstone's had promised,\nand the positive references from the\non-campus bookstores they already\noperate at universities such as Bath\nand UEA. Mr Corbett also pointed to\npositive relations with College officials, saying \"We got on really well\nwith them... after all, we are looking\nfor a partnership.\"\nOutlining plans for the new book-store, Mr Corbett explained that it\nwould broadly resemble the recently\nrefurbished branch at Notting Hill\nGate, but that an external designer\nwould be brought in to make the IC\nstore \"a bit whizz y.\" The store will\noperate with a core staff of eight, and\nnegotiations are already underway to\ntransfer existing staff directly from\nthe Union outlet. It is not yet clear\nwhether Waterstone's will offer part-time jobs to students. Innovations\nmay include the sale of second-hand\nbooks and a discount voucher\nscheme. Although the new store will\nstock a small selection of fiction\ntitles, Mr Corbett affirmed\nWaterstone's commitment to make\nthe IC branch \"The most authoritative and comprehensive science and\ntechnology bookshop in the co un try-Defending the Union's ability to\nmanage, Mr Allsop claimed \"College\nhave failed yet again to believe we\nare capable of doing the job. All our\ntrading outlets have either come online at a profit, or turned inherited\nCollege loss-makers into successful\nventures... For example, the Union\nbar and catering.\"\nMr Allsop went on to suggest that\nsome College administrators \"are\nalready regarding with jealous eyes\"\nsuccessful Union ventures such as\nDa Vinci's Catering, and may be\nseeking to control the way ICU funds\nsporting clubs. The College already\nmakes direct contributions to select\ngroups, most notably the boat club.\nAddressing the wider issues raised\nby the College's decision, the ICU\nPresident outlined the advantages of\nStudents' Unions running their own\ntrading outlets; they can offer a friendlier and hence superior service,\nthey are receptive and adaptive to\nstudents' needs and any surplus they\ngenerate is wholly reinvested in\nimproved services. The profits from\ntrading outlets also afford ICU a degree of financial autonomy, protecting it from the vagaries of national HE funding policy. Were this\nautonomy to be removed, Mr Allsop\nbelieves, the College would have\nunprecedented control over Union\nspending decisions. Although the\nloss of the bookstore will have only\nminor immediate consequences,\nlarger and longer-term projects, and\nperhaps even the day-to-day running\nof the Union may be increasingly\nsubject to College authority. This,\nMr Allsop maintains, could threaten\nto remove IC students from future\ndecision-making processes, even\nthough they are the intended beneficiaries of HE funding and ultimately\nthe customers of campus trading out-lets.\nFire alarm farce MATTHEW KEMP TON On the last Friday of term students in\nSouthwell Hall, Evelyn Gardens had\nto evacuate the building after an\nimpostor smashed five fire alarms.\nAt approximately 5pm fire alarms\nstarted ringing in houses 56 and 57.\nAfter waiting outside in the street,\nwhere there was no roll call, the students were moved into the main\nentrance of the hall, where a bizzar e set of events followed.\nA member of Evelyn Gardens\nsecurity ordered everyone to their\nrooms while a sub warden blocked\nthe way to half the hall. At this point\na drunken man came in, calling himself the 'senior fire officer of\nImperial College' and ordered\neveryone out. This was clearly not\nthe case as an argument followed\nwhich ended with the security man\nsaying 'I don't know who the hell\nyou are, just get lost' and the impostor leaving. Subwarden Guy\nFranklin later discovered the\nsmashed fire alarms and also found\nthe 'fire officer' wandering around\ntrying to find his swipe card and\nglasses. He was taken to see the warden Ken Young who discovered that\nhe had set off the fire alarms after\ndrinking with a friend. A disciplinary hearing will take place soon.\nCollege mislays a \u00a3million in cheques\nNEWS TEAM A major disaster for postgraduate\nstudents was narrowly averted\nthanks to the heroic efforts of the\nCollege Student Finance Office, who\ntracked down missing Engineering\nand Physical Science Research\nCouncil grant cheques worth nearly\n\u00a3lm in total.\nThe absence of the cheques went\nunnoticed until the 2nd January\nalthough they were expected on the\nlast day of term.\nIn their defence, the Student\nFinance Office cited several factors\nthat had contributed to the temporary\nloss of the cheques. The system for\ndelivering funds has changed recent-ly, in order to prevent institutions\ninvesting the money. Following\nGovernment initiatives, the EPSRC\nhas introduced the practice of sending grant money only when it is due,\nrather than paying colleges in full at\nthe beginning of the year. A decision\nto send the money on the 23rd December was reversed when the\nSFO pointed out that College would\nclose on the 20th. The EPSRC\nagreed to send them at noon on the\n20th. Owing to bad weather the\ncourier was late, though this turned\nout not to be the major\nproblem.. .seeing as he actually took\nthem to the Royal College of Art.\nThe security guard who signed for\nthe cheques at the time informed\nFelix that he hadn't realised the\ncourier had got the wrong place, as\n\"...the package was small and the\naddress obscure.\"\nTony Cullen, Assistant Registrar,\nexpressed his concerns about the\nmatter \".. .only as a last resort would\nwe have cancelled the cheques. It\nwould have caused untold problems\nand aggravation to a lot of people,\nnot least students needing to pay\ntheir rent and the like.\"\nFortunately the cheques were\nrecovered on the 2nd and so they\nwere eventually issued only one day\nlate.\nNews in Brief\nYANKS BEAT IC\nOn New Year's Day BBC viewers\nhad a chance to watch Jeremy\nPaxman sneer at American as well as\nBritish students in the International\nUniversity Challenge match between\nImperial College and the University\nof Michigan.\nIC started badly, and although they\ndrew level a couple of times,\nMichigan leapt ahead in the last 10\nminutes, beating IC by a wide mar-gin. \"We had an off day\" said team\ncaptain Mark Pallen. He also conceded that Michigan were the better\nteam. In an attempt to excuse what\nPaxman described as their dress,\nPallen stated that Granada had told\nIC to dress casually but Michigan to\ndress smartly.\nHowever, it is not yet over for last\nyear's team; they are shortly to\ndepart for the States to compete in\ntheir National Academic Quiz.\nTRAFFIC BLACK SPOT\nIt was a bad start to the new year for\nthe passengers of a white Volvo who\nwere involved in a serious car accident last Sunday. The incident took\nplace at the turning into Prince\nConsort Road, just outside the\nPhysics Department. The road was\nclosed off for several hours and it\ntook firemen over an hour to free the\npassengers, having to resort in the\nend to cutting the roof of the car off.\nIn contrast the driver of the other car\ninvolved escaped with minor\ninjuries.\nThe turning by the Huxley\nBuilding seems to be something of a traffic black spot. Last summer, as\nreported in Felix, there was an accident involving an out-of-control\nBMW and a stationary Rover.\nLuckily there were no serious\ninjuries.\nIC RADIO BROKEN INTO\nLast weekend thieves raided\nSouthside Disco and escaped with\nover \u00a31500 of equipment belonging\nto Imperial College Radio. Having\npulled the door away from the booth,\nthey made off with two record play-ers, a CD player and a mixer.\nCollege Security are at present\ncompiling a report on the theft.\n, v ny one with any information on the\ntheft should contact Paul Brown or\nIan Hickvale, at IC Radio\n\n"

    "content": "10 COLUMNS& NOTICES FELIX FRIDAY 10TH JANUARY\nFirst things first, let me wish all of\nyou (or should that be both of you?)\na Happy New Year. Slight change to\nthe usual format this week as you\nwill see later, but first a couple of\nthings to deal with. Unfortunately\nspace does not permit me to mention\nthe exe crab ly awful meal I endured\non my first ever trip to the SCR on\nMonday. Shift the decimal point one\nplace to the left on your cash regis-ter s, College Catering, and you will\nbegin to charge what your products\nare worth.\nThere is however time to mention\nthe grant cheque fiasco, reported\nelsewhere, but you heard it here first.\nLast Thursday the cheques for a significant proportion of the Colleges\nPhD students arrived in Sherfield.\nNo problem, I hear you cry. A simple\nmatter of delivering them to the\nStudent finance office, where these\nthings have been dealt with since the\ndawn of time. But no, the cheques\nwent walk about. So per ambulatory were they, the possibility of stopping\nif he m was contemplated on Friday\nmorning when they still hadn't sur-Ifaced. Thankfully, they turned up\nIthat lunchtime and were promptly\ndished out. What a start to 1997.\nSimon Baker\nVoice of Reason\nThere now follows an open letter to\nthe Rector, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, concerning Campus Renaissance.\nDear Rector,\nFirstly, let me thank you and Ian\nCaldwell for the excellent presentation that you gave last term on\nCampus Renaissance. Say what you\nwill about the Estates Division, and\nfrankly I have said more than most,\nthey are not short of ideas and vision.\nThe transformation of Queen's Lawn\nand surrounding area looks awe-some, and the proposed reappraisal\nof Sherfield hinted at by Mr Caldwell\nis most refreshing; I found it both satisfying and unnerving that almost all\nmy questions and suggestions had\nbeen anticipated! Quite rightly, the\naccommodation has not been over-looked, with the continued renovation and expansion of the existing\nstock. This, we were told would be\npaid for by commercial activities,\nprincipally conferencing. Here I began to waiver.\nThe question you will recall I asked concerned the funding of these\nprojects by conference profits. I clearly failed to explain myself,\nhence your somewhat terse res pons es. The problems I have with this are\nas follows. As Ian Caldwell said at\nthe presentation. College accommodation is a net consumer of cash,\ndespite existing conferencing and\nreasonably high rents to students.\nThis should be a cause of grave con-cern, and rectifying it to an extent\nshould be relatively easy. All support\nservices, such as cleaning and main-ten ance, should be contracted out.\nImperial is in the business of educating not running service companies. It\nalso seems unnecessary for IC to\nown the halls of residence. Whilst\nacknowledging that Linstead Hall\ncould be an exception, the possibility\nof selling the freeholds and leasing\nback the buildings or mortgaging, as\nis the trend in corporate property\nmanagement, should be investigated.\nWe have highly valued, poor performing assets, tying up huge\namounts of cash. Only when the bottom line is in a healthy condition\nshould large-scale investment be\ncontemplated.\nAs it is at the moment, I fear that a likely consequence of the proposed\ninvestment will simply drive up costs\nto the point that the College prices\nitself out of its chosen market, and\nbegin to compete with hotels and\nother, more specialised providers.\nThis will inevitably put upward pressure on student rents, which could\neven force those for whom halls\nwould have been the natural choice\nto seek accommodation elsewhere.\nThe way in which IC can generate\nmore revenue is not to expand inefficient low-margin activities, but to\nfirst tackle waste, improve management accountability and divest functions better done by others. There is\nenormous scope College-wide.\nWishing you and Lady Oxburgh a Happy New Year.\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nI must be in luck: each\nMonday morning I wonder what I'm going to\nwrite about for the week, and each time\nanother Tory MP takes a tumble. Jerry\nHayes, the 43 year old Member for\nHarlow, is at the centre of yet another\nsex scandal for the Conservative Party,\nwith an ex-researcher of his spilling the\nbeans to the News of the World. Sex\nscandals are a serious business, in more\nways than one, and they usually follow\na set pattern: there is some basis in truth,\nand some breathtaking naivet e in the\nMP's past. A press release then goes\nround on Saturday, in time for the\nSunday vultures to prepare their stories.\nSince MPs are taught to keep quiet in\nthese cases, the papers are full of the\nother side's story. If the MP is a minis-ter, he will resign immediately. If he is a backbencher, he will return to face the\nwrath of his constituency, populated\nmainly by shocked elderly ladies.\nThis case has a nasty twist, however.\nThe story was released by his ex-employee and one-time Young\nConservative Paul Stone, who received\n\u00a375,000 for the exclusive: a tidy packet\nfor a24 year-old trainee accountant.\nThe role of Max Clifford, the ubiquitous\npublicist who simultaneously announced his \"vendetta\" against the\nTories, is worrying: he freely admits he\ntimed the announcement with the Prime\nMinister's new crusade on family values to cause maximum damage to the\nGovernment, saying \"in a new year and\nin the run up to a General Election, it is\nimportant to remind the British public of j the Conservative Party's real values.\"\nHe promises to reveal more scandals in\nthe coming months. His justification is\nthe poor treatment, at the hands of the\nNHS, of his disabled daughter over the\nlast ten years, and he has taken it upon\nhimself to wreak revenge on the\nGovernment. The Labour Party are\nplaying the long game: they have managed to criticise Clifford for such a brazen declaration and point out that\nthey never make political capital out of|\nTory scandals (although John Prescott\ncouldn't resist a quick jibe that \"Major's new push on family values was bound\nto end in tears, and it has.\") They are\nacutely conscious that they may soon be\ntargets themselves.\nEven the press are beginning to tire of |\nthese ceaseless scandals, with the\ntabloids giving it headline news treatment one day and completely forgetting\nabout it the next, and most broadsheets\nfitting it around other more newsworthy\nstories. With Paul Stone's supercilious\nsmile shining out of the paper's alongside Max Clifford's horrendously arrogant presumptions, and a story based\npurely on the word of 24-year-old with\na \u00a375,000 cheque - no evidence has\nappeared -1 am confident of where my\nsympathies lie.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE FOR\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENTS THE PROCEDURE FOR EXTENDING YOUR LEAVE TO REMAIN HAS RECENTLY CHANGED.

The bookstore's growing surplus, after considerable re investment in\nAfter running the Imperial College Union Bookstore for over a decade, ICU has been forced to cease the sale of academic books from Easter. The loss of its \u00a3 1 M turnover will amount to a halving of the Union's trading activity. Despite the Union's strong tender to run the new shop, the Rector has awarded the contract to Water stones, a WH Smith subsidiary. They will be the sole provider of academic texts on campus from the19 th of April1997 the official opening date of the new shop according to the tender. The Union's investment in book selling equipment will be lost, as will\nyears of experience in the IC market; a market built\nfrom the loss making ven ture originally inherited by the Union. In spite of two years of\npreparation, and a lengthy tendering process, the news was the shop, reached given to the Union only on the last\nday of the Winter term. ICU has still\nnot received written conformation, or explanation of the decision and the reasons behind it. Since the Union's bid got through to the' second round', beating Dillon s, Blackwell s and The Modern Book in excess of\n\u00a3 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 last year. Its loss will\ngreatly affect the Union's ability to\ngenerate its own funds which, considering the growing financial pressures on higher education, must be ICU's highest priority. Without the flexibility of its own funds the Union for projects like its summer refurbishment of dB's( \u00a3 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 ) .\nDuring its life the ICU Bookstore has admirably demonstrated how a single bookshop can compete on a level field with chain stores. Close cooperation with departments and students enabled it to stock the core books for each course, and electronic Catalogue and ordering systems enabled books to be obtained as fast as any other bookshop. Flexibility\nof operation and constant feedback from customers enabled the shop to\nrespond to. customer demands, and tailor its\nopening hours to suit the college. Its pricing policy of never being knowingly undersold, and customer care ethos was enhanced by the combination of part-time student staff and experienced professionals to provide a truly\nfriendly environment. The only real problem was the cong es tion - alleviated somewhat by the\nopening of the ICU Newsagents which would have been cured by a move to the new, larger shop. If you want more information ring\nthe Union Office on x48060, or email\nany of the sabbatical officers\n(see www.su.ic.ac.uk/union/index.htm)\nThe provision of commercial services enables the Union to both provide essential services to the college, and to ensure such services adhere to the aims and objectives of the Union, determined by you the students. Via the Union's democratic committee structure, services are run in a student orientated, and fully\naccountable manner. The union can ensure quality and value for\nmoney in a purely altruistic man Graphic opposite:\ndB's, in the Union Building. Its\n\u00a3130,000 refurbishment was entirely funded by Union trading surplus.\nner that no company can ever match. The income they generate also contributes greatly to the wellbeing of the rest of the Union. Money that would otherwise have been spent offsite is retained within the College and ploughed back into the noncommercial services the Union provides. The students get to decide what they want their money spent on, rather than having togo cap in hand to college. Given the current financial pressures on College, is it likely that the summer refurbishment of\ndB's would have been a priority to the powers that be? It gives the Union a level of autonomy and flexibility that could not be achieved were it totally reliant upon the College for funding. Furthermore, the Union benefits from the professionalism engendered by the earning process. Staff and student officers of ICU are well aware of the harsh financial realities of the real world, and our policy of employing students wherever possible gives vital work experience as well as a timetable friendly job. Unlike other employers, we recognise that college work and exams must come first,\nand so rota our staff around their commitments.

Professor Ruddock was born in a small mining village in South Wales.\nHis exceptional mathematical ability\nrapidly earned him recognition at\nWest Monmouth Grammar School,\nand secured him a place at IC to\nstudy Physics in 1957. It was here\nthat he was to spend the rest of his\nacademic career. The young Keith\nRuddock developed an interest in\noptics. Under the influence of\nProfessor David Wright, a leading\noptical physicist, he soon became\ninfluential in his chosen area of\nresearch, the study of vision in\nhumans.\nHis success in improving our\nunderstanding of normal vision led to\nhis study of abnormalities of vision\nin patients who had suffered brain\ndamage as a result of stroke or\ntumour. His aim was not only to\nstretch the frontiers of medical science but also to help the many individual patients involved in his pro-j ect. Ruddock was a true human it ari an, regularly travelling across the\ncountry to visit patients who were\nunable to come to London, carrying\nportable equipment specially\ndesigned by him. Several of his\npatients, some of whom knew him\nfor nearly twenty years, became personal friends of the Professor.\nHe was awarded a Royal Society\nExchange Fellowship to work in\nVenezuela with Gunnar Svaetichin, a leading researcher into single-cell\nelectro-physiological recording. On\nhis return to IC, Professor Ruddock\nwas able to use the knowledge he had\ngained to establish a research programme at Silwood Park, where he\nrecorded from within cells in the ret i na.\nAlways finding his research led\nhim into controversial ground\nRuddock always showed great diplo-macy, maintaining his stance yet at\nthe same time respecting the views of\nothers.\nNot only was he a dedicated\nresearcher, the Professor was also\nhighly committed to teaching. He\nwas a charismatic lecturer who\ninstilled a deep enthusiasm for biophysics in his students, often competing to carry out final-year projects or\nPhD's with him. \"Keith really\nengaged students during his passionate lectures on Biophysics, in fact I would say he was one of the best lecturers in the whole department\" one\nof his students remarked.\nIn 1988 he became Professor of\nBiophysics and in 1991 was appointed Head of the Biophysics group in\nthe Physics Department.\nRuddock greatly enjoyed visiting\nformer students all over the world\nand also made frequent trips abroad\nto lecture. It was this love of foreign\ntravel which fueled his passion for\nlanguages - most notably Chinese.\nIn addition to his work for the\nCollege, Keith Ruddock was on several editorial boards and national\ncommittees. He found his work for\nthe Vision Research Working Party\nof the Welcome Trust particularly\nenjoyable. In 1985 he became one of\nthe four founding members of the\nNeuro-op thal m ology Club, the continuing success of which can be\nattributed to his relentless en thus i asm.\nRuddock was not just a brilliant\nscientist but a man who lived life to\nthe full, cramming a lot into his 58\nyears. He took a keen interest in\nrugby and cricket and loved the\nPHOTO: MEILIN SANCHO\nopera.\nHis political beliefs, formed in the\nWelsh valleys of his youth inspired a life-long commitment to socialism,\nled to his marriage in 1963 to Joan\nAnthony, now a Labour MP. They\nhad known each other as teenagers\nand she followed him to IC. They\nspent thirty happy years together but\nthey separated in 1990.\nKeith Ruddock was well-liked and\nrespected by all who met him and\nwill be sorely missed by his family,\nfriends and colleagues.\nImperial ranks fourth for research\nMATHIEU RICHARD\nThe 1996 Research Assessment\nExercise, whose results were published just before Christmas, show\nsignificant improvements in the quality of UK research since 1992.\nThe survey, organised by the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England, evaluates the performances of research institutions in 69\nsubject fields, classifying them in 7\ncategories, from 5* (excellence in all\nsub-areas)to 1.\nIn 1992, the ex-polytechnics participated in the survey for the first\ntime. This year, 192 universities took\npart, covering a total number of\n55,000 researchers. A clear rise in the\nstandards of research has been\naccomplished, with a national average score higher by half a grade than\nthat in 1992.\nUnsurprisingly, Oxford was\nranked top, closely followed by\nCambridge. However, not all the\nresults were so predictable.\nSeveral universities far surpassed\nexpectations, with Goldsmith\nCollege, for example, rising from\n59th to 26th place and Bath\nUniversity, which made it into the\ntop ten.\nThe ex-polytechnics are clearly\nstill catching up on the research front\nin comparison to the old universities.\nMost occupy the lowest rankings in\nthe table apart from a few exceptions.\nThe figures show that most high-level research is still done in English\nuniversities but Scotland, Wales and\nNorthern Ireland are now contributing more significantly. As Brian\nFender, HEFCE's Chief Executive\nputs it \"the real winner of this survey\nis not Oxford, or any of the top ranking universities but the United\nKingdom, which is benefiting from a huge range of high-quality work.\"\nImperial College was ranked\nfourth in the UK, after Oxbridge and\nLSE, attaining an average grading of\n5. A breakdown of this figure reveals\nthat of the research staff at IC, 26%\nwere awarded a5*,50% a grade 5,\nand 22% a grade 4.\nThese results give a good overall\nimpression of the quality of research\nat Imperial, but a more in-depth picture emerges when the 21 subjects\nsubmitted by IC are assessed separately. The departments of the Royal\nCollege of Science all obtained grade\n5 or above, as did all the Engineering\ndepartments. Pure Mathematics\nrecieved a5* rating, leaving even\nCambridge behind.\nSlightly inferior results were\nachieved by the Royal Schools of\nMines and Business and\nManagement, though the grades did\nnot fall below a4. This was somewhat balanced by\nthe Medical School of Imperial\nCollege, St Mary's, ranking top in\npre-clinical studies and the National\nHeart & Lung Institute receiving 5*s for all their departments, demonstrating IC's supremacy in hospital-based\nsubjects.\n\n"

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 10TH IANUARY\nFurther action from the AUT\nMATTHEW BENNETT\nThe Association of University\nTeachers, the largest union involved\nin the one day strike in higher education last November, is to ballot its\nmembers on further action, which\ncould involve disruption of universi-ties' admissions procedures and\nexam marking.\nThe strike took place a week before\nthe November budget and may have\nbeen one of the factors that lead to an\nincrease in higher education funding\nof \u00a3100 million. This was hailed to\nbe a victory as, although it constituted a real term decrease in funding per\nstudent of 0.5%, a fall of 3% was\nanticipated. The Universities and\nColleges Employers Association,\nwho negotiate pay for staff in HE,\nchanged their offer of a pay increase\nfrom 1.5% to 5% over two years.\nThis offer was rejected by the unions\ninvolved in the dispute, and the\nunions organised a \"boycott of be u roc racy\" which mainly involved non\nco-operation in teaching quality\nassessments, which are seen as\nunnecessary and time consuming.\nThe unions rejected the improved\npay offer because it came with a range of provisions and conditions\nattached, which they deemed unacceptable. One condition was that the\nworkers who went on strike would\nhave 1/260 of their annual pay\ndocked. The unions insisted that only\n1/365 should be docked, asking\nwhether their members were only\nexpected to work 260 days a year.\nUCEA subsequently amended\ntheir offer to two years' increase of\n2.5%, with fewer strings, including\nthe removal of the 1/260 clause, but\nthis was rejected by the unions.\nThe AUT committee had pledged\nto give UCEA until the end of\nNovember to produce a\"s at is facto ry\" pay offer. When this was seen as\nun for fh coming, further action was\nsuggested. The original ballot in\nNovember covered \"other action\nshort of a strike\" and the unions\ninstructed members not to cooperate\nwith any reviews or assessments, to\nwork only to contract, and not to do\nextra hours or carry out unpaid work\nor teaching. Academic teaching staff\nhave been instructed to stop external\nexamining.\nThe AUT then announced their\nintention to ballot members over a possible boycott of exam marking\nand a slowing down of admissions\nprocedures. It is the problems that\nthis will create for admissions that\nthe AUT says is \"creating very considerable political interest that will\nhelp in convincing employers to\nchange their position\". Notices were\nsent to employers covering the intention to ballot in December, and the\npapers are expected to be sent out this\nweek. Results are expected in late\nJanuary.\nOn a local level, IC are one of the\ncolleges who are sticking to docking\n1/260 of the striker's pay, while\nmany other institutions have already\nmoved to the 1/365 scale. They did,\nhowever, make a one off payment in\nplace of a pay increase to staff in\nDecember as a \"pay advance on\naccount\" which was hailed by Mark\nScrimshaw, the secretary of the IC\nAUT committee as a sign of the college authorities' sympathy to the\nstaff's pay demands.\nMore funding for Mary's CJD research\nPAUL SQUIRES\nResearchers at St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School may soon be celebrating the arrival of a \u00a31 million\nMedical Research Council grant. The\nfunding will allow research into\nprion diseases to continue, with particular reference to Creutzfeldt-Jakob\ndisease, an illness suspected to derive\nfrom the so called 'mad cow' dis-ease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. The decision is to be taken\nsome time this month following science budget allocations.\nProfessor John Collinge has been\nleading the research group at St\nMary's and the extra funding would\nallow him to develop plans for the\nestablishment of a research unit committed to neuro degenerative dis-eases. The possibility of such an\noffer comes after the recent successes of the Mary's team, which has\nbeen the leading institution researching into CJD. Last October they published the first direct evidence indicating the transmission of BSE from\ncattle to humans, as reported in Felix\n1067.\nProfessor Collinge also intends to\ninvestigate new evidence that some\npeople may have a genetic predisposition to the disease.\nAlso likely to benefit from MRC funding is Harash Narang, a scientist\nbased in Newcastle. His controversial research, especially his claim to\nhave developed a urine test for CJD\nand BSE, has highlighted the need\nfor further research into this area.\nThough in his case, far tighter initial\nconditions are expected to be\nimposed by the Research Council,\nensuring that his findings are verified\nby other experts, before they agree to\nfund him.\nIn response to a likely Office of\nScience and Technology edict to\nconcentrate funding on CJD-BSE\nresearch, the MRC's future allocations of grants will reflect the current\n'beef crisis'. The OST is reported to\nbe considering 'top-slicing' around\n\u00a37 million of its own budget to fund\n\"scientific efforts\" into BSE and CJD\nresearch.\n\n"

Students lose out to Water stone's ROBIN RILEY\nStaff and students of Imperial\nCollege Union have reacted with dismay following the decision by\nCollege to award the tender for the\nnew Bookstore to high street booksellers Waterstone's. Unofficial notification of the decision came in a telephone call from\nProfessor Alan Swanson to Union\nManager Many Hurford on the last\nday of term before the Christmas\nbreak, and was confirmed verbally\nlater that day in an emergency meeting between the Rector and ICU\npresident, Eric Allsop. At the time of\ngoing to press, the Union has\nreceived no official communication\nregarding the decision but is in no\ndoubt as to the result, Waterstone's having been informed of their successful bid.\nThis has prompted the issue of a strongly-worded press release by\nUnion executives, together with an\nadvertising campaign condemning\nthe decision. The new store, currently under construction beneath the\nmain library, is due to begin trading\non April 19th. When the new branch\nof Waterstone's opens, the Union\nwill be required to cease the sale of\nbooks from its site situated on the\nSherfield walkway. According to\nUnion officials, the loss of the bookstore as a trading outlet may have\npotentially devastating repercussions\nfor the way the Union operates, and\nthe scope of its activities.\nMr Eric Allsop expressed his frustration at the lack of feedback on the\nUnion's losing bid: \"I still can't see\nwhat it was that Waterstone's could\nhave offered that we couldn't.\" Union staff had high hopes for\ntheir bid to tender, which reached the\nlast round of competition with\nWaterstone's, beating Dillons,\nBlackwell's and the Modern Book\nPHOTO: LING\nThe golden arches of the local branch of McWaterstone's. Waterstone's have promised a \"powerful IT\" investment in the new bookstore,\ndescribed by the area manger to be a \"bit whizz y.\" Company. Mr Allsop suggested that\nthe College committee set-up to\nadvise the Rector on awarding the\ntender may have adopted a \"Corner-shop mentality,\" labour ing under the\nbelief that the Union, lacking the\nresources of a national chain like\nWaterstone's, would be unable to\noperate a much larger store even\nthough it would have access to the\nsame suppliers, staff pool and\nInformation Technology facilities as\nan external company.\nThe newly-appointed Deputy\nRector, Professor Alan Swanson,\nwas a member of the committee\nwhich examined the bids to tender.\nSpeaking to Felix, Prof Swanson\nexplained that all five bids were of\nsimilar quality, and that all five\norganisations had produced very similar estimates of the likely sales and\nprofitability of the new store. He\nlikened the decision to choosing\nbetween equally competent candidates at a job interview, saying\n\"Another group of people might have\nmade a different decision.\"\nReports suggest the committee\nwas asked by the Rector to focus\nsolely upon determining which\norganisation would provide the best\nservice, and not to consider the wider\nimplications of each bid. This may\nhave hindered the Union's bid, one of\nits main selling points being the fact\nthat profits would remain on campus.\nProf Swanson refused to be drawn on\nwhether, with hindsight, this somewhat blinkered approach had in fact\nproven the best way to proceed. He\nmaintained that the objectives of the\ncommittee had been clearly set out\nby the Rector at the time of its c re ation. Answering the allegation that\nthe College had made a serious error\nof judgement, Prof Swanson replied:\n\"College hasn't shot itself in the foot;\njust maybe shot the Union.\"\nThe ICU President made clear his\ndissatisfaction with the way the decision had been reached, and particularly the timing of the announcement,\nwhich came just before the Christmas\nholiday. Mr Allsop reported that\nUnion staff were \"absolutely gutted\"\nby the decision, and that morale was\nat an all-time low. He concluded that\nthe decision by the College was\n\"., .the most devastating thing to happen to the Union for as long as I can\nremember.\"\nThe ultimate role of the committee\nin the final decision remains unclear.\nIt is not known whether the committee directly recommended Waterstone's to the Rector, or whether it\nmerely advised him upon the advantages and disadvantages of each of\nthe two finalist's bids. Further recommendations may have been made\nby other groups, for example the\nCollege Management Planning\nGroup. These questions may not be\nfully answered until the Rector, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, returns from a visit\nto Hong Kong.\nThe Deputy Rector was keen to\nrepeat assurances that the shortfall in\nthe Union's trading surplus resulting\nfrom the loss of the bookstore would\nbe covered by an increase in the\nannual sub vent ion. When pressed as\nto whether this switch in sources of\nincome would affect the Union's autonomy, Prof Swanson claimed\nthat the financing of most students'\nunions is arbitrary. He went on to\nexplain that however well-run ICU's trading outlets might be, they operate\nfrom College property and so cannot\nreally be considered independent\nsources of revenue. Furthermore,\nProf Swanson pointed out that the\nloss of the bookstore affected only\naround 7% of the Union's total bud-continued on page two\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 10TH TANUARY FEATURE9 In order to overcome the excesses of the festive period,\na Mental Gymnasium of Science is recommended\nTwentieth Century science had\npromised a Brave New World, until\nAushwitz and the Atom bomb. Dr\nMichael Taylor challenges the unethical hotbed of politics and economics\nthat still influences the scientific\nestablishment today.\nWhen scientists like Ampere, Volta social responsibility even then? I and Ohm first understood electricity\nover two centuries ago, no doubt they\ndreamt night and day of fantastic\nmachines to ease the toil of the land\nfor food; to tap the riches of nature\ndeep below mountain, river, tree and\nocean. Their genius gave us the\nopportunity to have surplus production following the industrial re vol u tion, meaning that we had the potential to harness nature's resources to\nmeet everyone's needs. The invention of the light-bulb by Edison\nwould release us from the blindness\nof the night. It seemed as though science had as its basic aim the mastery\nof nature to meet the basic needs of\nsociety - food, clothing, shelter and\nhealth.\nWhy now, as we are on the verge\nof completing the gene map of the\nhuman body, is half of our world\nheld hostage by famine and disease?\nIs it the failure of science? If so, how\ncan we justify research into time\ntravel, the rings of Saturn or the division of a fundamental particle which,\neven after a closer look, seem irrelevant to society at large? If it is not the\nfailure of of science, then shouldn't we be the tribunes of society, opposing the very system that we know has\nfailed to solve these problems?\nIt is important to appreciate that scientists are part of society and so are\ninfluenced by the ideas of society.\nThe prevalent ideas belong to those\nwho own and control the media,\nindustry and academia. Darwin's theory of natural selection wasn't published for 40 years because of the\nstrong creationist ideas in his society.\nCertainly scientists are the ones who\nchoose to work with the military\nbehind barbed wire fences as strategists of destruction, as torture technologists and as germ warfare advisors. Whether or not this is a free\nchoice, in the face of the entry of the\nmarket into most campus ses is deb at able, but do scientists not have a argue we do. Let us never forget that\nit was a chemist who gave Hitler a formula for making soap from\nhuman fat to be sold in the market. A nuclear physicist outlined energetics\nof nuclear fission to the politicians\nwho made the atomic bomb, from\nwhich generations of Japanese still\nsuffer hereditary disorders; a biologist tested Anthrax on sheep, effectively quarantining a whole island off\nthe British mainland, while a mathematician decoded cold war memos\nresulting in brutal military counter\nmeasures.\n\"Science has been\nplagued by capitalism\"\nOur crimes are many and our criticisms few. It is time we faced up to\nsome hard facts. We are not in control of the fruits of our work. As\npawns in a game of chess, we are\nemployed by those who, by deciding\nour funding, also decide our aims for\ntheir own ends. Big oil companies\nlike Shell and BP don't fund research\ninto ecologically friendly cars, for\nexample. Instead, the fruits of our\nlabour are to be used by unelected\nand unaccountable corporation directors and military generals whose\nactions we have little or no democratic say in. I argue that only when scientists are part of a collectively run\nsociety producing for need, rather\nthan for profit, will science not suffer\nthe present corruptions under modern\ncapitalism.\nIt is widely accepted within the\nscientific community that the annals\nof scientific thought are expanding as\nnever before. A fact I can't dispute as\na young researcher struggling to keep\nabreast of monthly developments in\nmy own tiny sphere of research in the\nfield of space and atmospheric\nphysics. Unfortunately, education\nministers and university chancellors\ncomplacently proclaim that they are\nproud of the rate at which scientific\nresearch is being produced at a time\nwhen British scientists are deserting\nacademia in alarming numbers, due\nto grossly inadequate salaries and\nresources. This leaves a disconcerting mass of untapped scientific\npotential and ensures the proliferation of starvation and deadly dis-eases.\nThese defenders of the system\nspeak of the increase of efficiency in\nhigher education, quoting the fact\nthat approximately the same number\nof teachers now teach approximately\ntwice the number of students in higher education as two decades ago.\nWhile this is true and reflects the\nwholehearted dedication of the\nteachers to education they never\nmention the fact that they have not\nincreased resources. The annual government spending on higher education has remained at the same level -7.6% of the GDP (which has itself\nremained level) since 1976. It is not\nsurprising that over 120,000 members of staff in higher education were\non strike on the 19th November\ndemanding something better than the\n1.5% pay rise they were offered. The\nmyth that the cupboards are bare in\nDowning Street can easily be\nexposed when they try to justify\nspending \u00a361 billion on each Trident\nnuclear submarine, while schools\nclose for \"failing\", lecturers are laid\noff, and students live in poverty after\nhaving their rights to free prescriptions, housing benefit, income support and book grants stripped from\nthem. Now they face a tax to pay for\ntheir education. When John Major\nspoke of the need to \"go back to\nbasics\", he did not mean paltry\ninvestment in health and education.\nFurthermore, can we be sure that\nwe are really pushing back the frontiers as this expansion may suggest?\nIf we measure progress by technological ingenuity alone then perhaps\nthe answer to this question would be\nyes. If, on the other hand, we define\nprogress as that which betters life for\nmost of humanity then, in a world\nwhere over a tenth of the population\nis expected to die young, the answer\nmost certainly is no.\nWhile the close links being fostered between science and industry\nshould be nurtured to bring useful\ntools into the hands of those in need\nof them, the favouring of competition\nrather than co-operation between\nresearch groups sponsored by business means that science has also been\nburdened by capitalism. The research\ncentres place emphasis on lavish\ninterior decorating and glossy pamphlets to market their products.\nAlthough attention to detail in\nresearch is vital for a probing under-standing, one look at job advertisements in science magazines such as\nNature, New Scientist and Scientific\nAmerican show the extent to which\nscientists have become narrowed.\nIntellectual isolation ensures a lack\nof opportunity for research, leading\nto delays in breakthroughs, during\nwhich time millions will die of diseases like cancer and AIDS.\nFurthermore, the pressure faced by\nmost young scientists to find contracts is married to a new measure of\nability - the number of research\npapers written. Unfortunately, my\nown experience has taught me that if\nyou want to write more papers in a year, something else has to give.\nResearch inevitably becomes more\nsuperficial and speculative. Is this\ngood science? I feel we should be\nprobing for deeper knowledge and\naiming towards sociological uses for\nexisting and contemporary ideas.\n\"Research inevitably\nbecomes more superficial and speculative\"\nIt is not only science that loses out by\nthis superficiality. Ask someone\nwhen you next buy your fish and\nvegetables in your local market,\n\"who is a more useful part of society:\na doctor, a mathematician, a chemist,\na biologist or a physicist?\" They'll\ntell you the doctor even though all\nfive of them have the same letters\nafter their names.\nAt a time when we can send people to the moon while half of our\npopulation suffers from hunger and\npoverty then we have some serious\nmoral questions to answer before the\nestablishment can praise the achievements of science. In the words of\nAbu Saide Abolhair, \"in the process\nof marching to the horizon of civilisation, let's first stand up and take a step further.\" Only when famine and\ndisease become a past stage in our\nevolutionary history can we say that\nscience is as broad as it is long.\n\n"
