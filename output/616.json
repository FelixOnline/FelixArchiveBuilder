    "content": "Dear Mark\nAs usual, there are a whole\nbunch of points in the last\nissue of FELIX which deserve\ncomment, but the pompous\nramblings of that self opinionated ass Morton really\nclinch it. He obviously appreciates that information is\npower, and appears to be\nclinging tightly to both come on Daddy Nicholas, what is Morton's Mystery?\nWith his total lack of action,\nand his neglecting to inform\nus of plans to close the Union refectory and waste more money on the Lower Lounge,\nit's hardly surprising there's such disinterest in the Union.\nThere is precious little to be\ninterested in.\nOur illustrious President's report is chock-a block with\nthe wonderful things he has\ndone for us. I would just like\nto add that the high-sounding\nthree way negotiation over the\ngames machines involved a single phone call, when I carried out the same task for\nTi zard Hall two years ago. Of course it's quite possible that\nthe Union bureaucracy could\nmake this twice as complicated as necessary, as they do\nwith the club transport subsidies.\nI'm glad to hear Marco had\nsuch a lovely time in Sweden,\nand of course an international\nviewpoint and perspective is\nimportant and useful to\neveryone. Unfortunately, if\nthe rest of us only get to learn\nthat there were discussions on\n\"technical development with\nspecific reference to... the effects on society both positive\nand negative\", perhaps the\n\u00a3200 was not well spent. Some specific information would be a better justification\nfor the trip than the news that\nMarco made a load of pals\nand didn't want to come back\nto London.\nFinally, I appreciate that\nwith the peril of exams approaching, first years are\ninclined to let their minds\nwander to the meaning of li le, as their past experiences Hash\nbefore their eyes. Next time\nsome boring muddled bt tr k like Tim Larcombe writes a logically incoherent soapbox\narticle, I would never th less be\ngrateful if you would just Hush\nit down the appropriate receptacle.\nThanks lor a year's interesting reading.\n] 'ours\nJell' Fowler\nDear Mark\nI was fascinated by your\ninsight into Nick Morton's depth of knowledge of student\nopinions expressed in your\neditorial last week. You omitted to mention his escapades involving residence.\nHe himself admits (in his\nannual report) that he has\nmade himself unpopular on\nthis subject, a comment which\nis more true than many that\nhe has made. Our illustrious\nPresident's major folly in this\narea has been the affair of the\nlinen service. He started out\nwith a supposedly wonderful\nidea that he could save\nstudents a lot of money by\nscrapping this useful feature\nof Hall life. He commissioned\na costing of it, which indicated that students pay about\n\u00a31 per week to have their\nsheets and pillowcases washed,\nironed and delivered to their\nroom. Aha! He could save all\nthe poor students about \u00a330\nper year! But what could one\nreplace the service with? Another Morton brainstorm\noccurs (not unlike a thunderstorm only much more dan-gero us) \u2014 a 'central' laundry\nfacility could be introduced in\nthe basement ol Garden Hall,\nequipped with the machines\nfrom all the Halls' laundries.\nNow Garden Hall has many\nfewer residents than either\nSouthside or Linstead, so I can only conclude that this is\na new use of the word 'central'\nthat I had not previously been\naware of.\nThe last I heard, there had\nbeen no costing of the new\nlaundry, which will certainly\nbe very expensive, or any\nindication of where the\ncapital will come from. When asked about payment ol\nrunning costs ( currently sub sidi sed from Hall funds),\nNick\" proposed charging'' semi commercial\" rates,\n\"sav 50p per wash\" instead ol\n2()p. One should also note\nthat if students have to wash\nsheets as well, it is likely to\ntake two loads coasting \u00a3\\;\nthe savings to students are\nbeginning to diminish. Other\nsupposed advantages of the\nproposed scheme include the\nway that Southside and Linstead residents will have to\nwalk across the gardens to do\ntheir washing and that there\nwill be no security, so people\nwill have to sit and watch\ntheir washing, rather than\nreturning to their rooms to\nwork, etc.\nMorton's folly must have\nother points to commend it,\nlike the subtle aroma which\nwill come from rooms ol\nstudents who can't be bothered to wash their sheets, and\nof course the minimal amount\nol each student's money easily\noutweighs the extra inconvenience and time wasted;\ndoesn't it? The withdrawal of\nthe linen service is apparently\ndependent upon the provision\nof the new laundry; however,\nknowing how fast Estates\nwork, I very much doubt that\nthis could be achieved before\nthe end of September.\nThe most interesting aspect\nof the whole affair is Nick's concern about student op in ions. He was totally nonplussed by a petition from\nnearly a third of the residents\nof Southside asking for the\npresent service to be retained,\nbecause Morton knows better\nthan the students he purports\nto serve.\nJeremy Nunns\nDear Mark\nWe note that from FELIX G15 that certain sexual frustrations have become apparent in Weeks Hall. We also\nnote with pleasure that you\nhave reported the speed with\nwhich the Union is rectifying\nthis situation by provision of\nbrothel facilities in the\nSouthside Bar.\nThe Union has been actively investigating sex in this\nCollege. Indeed, the Honorary Secretary has only recently\nreturned from a highly successful fact-finding tour of Sweden.\nThe success of his research is\nclearly demonstrated by his\ncomplete lack of energy since\narriving back in England. Wc will probably ask P WP lo\ncarry out a further in-depth\nanalysis ol the affair before we\ndisband them (bilaterally!).\nClearly, we must act quickly\nto eradicate sexual devi an cy amongst IC students. This\nreached new heights when\nactivities involving three post-graduates, a bunk-bed and an\noversized micrometer led to\nthe collapse of a floor at 14\nMontpelier Street.\nFinally, there is no truth in\nthe rumour that a special\nSports Day medal will be\nawarded for sexual prowess at\nthe AGM to J. Martin Taylor\n(or was it MartinS. Taylor?).\nBilaterally yours\nNick and Christine\nPS: We are not against sex in\nprinciple.\nSir\nIt is with increasing dismay\nthat I read in your columns\nthe thoughts of those who\nseem to belittle the contribution to College life made by\nthat most eminent among your corr csp on dents, Dr Frank James. They surely\ncannot realise that Dr James'\nwritings are those of the most\nconsistently perceptive and\ninformed persons currently in\nCollege.\nIn my first year Dr James\ngot the new term off to a splendid start by describing in\nFELIX those involved in\nconstituent college unions as\n\" latent homosexual beers willing louts\", a criticism that was at the time wholly\njustified, and which has since\nhad a considerable effect.\nThis is the man that we are\nreally here considering, one\nwho is genuinely more concerned for the welfare of his\nchosen College than his own\npopularity or sabbatical credibility. In the same year\nDr James, in his in disputed role as the closest thing Continued on pa\u00abe4. Page 2 FELIX, May 28, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Missing Cert AA Directed by CostaGavras Now showing Empire 2, ABC\nFulham Rd.\nOn September 16, 1973, at the height of the\nmilitary coup which overthrew the government\nof Dr Salvador Allende in Chile, American\nwriter Charles Hor man( John Shea) dis-appa a red from his home in Santiago. This is\nundisputed fact.\nThe film traces the events following the\narrival of his father Edmund Hor man( Jack\nLemmon) in Santiago to investigate the\ndisappear n ce. It culminates in the revelation\nthat the American government was implicated\nin the overthrow of the Chilean government\nand the subsequent disappearance of Charles\nHor man because he knew too much. This is\npresented as fact, but is hotly disputed by the\nUS State Department.\nEdmund Hor man sued Henry Kissinger and\nnumerous other top US officials but to no\navail.\nThe film was clandestinely filmed in Mexico\nCity, looking not unlike Santiago, with startling\nrealism. Chilean troops were shown every bit\nas menacing as when this writer had the good\nfortune to find himself in Santiago in more\nstable times last year. This, coupled with\nLemmon's brilliant performance a? Edmund\nHorman, showing him to be a man of deep\ndetermination, and a supporter of the \"American Way\" whose great confidence in\ngovernment officials fades rapidly as he begins\nto see through their glossy, compassionate\nfacade, makes Missing one of the best serious\nfilms this year. It was America's entry to the\nCannes Film Festival which must be a blow to\nthe US State Department, who in their\ndetermined efforts to find the truth, have\nproduced a three page denial of events\nportrayed in the film in order that the public\nmay be correctly informed.\nIt is deliberate that I have not said if Charles\nHor man was eventually found or not. If you\ndon't already know the whole story then it is\nbetter to avoid other reviews and to see the\nfilm, as I. did, experiencing the same sense of\nuncertainty that Edmund Hor man and his\ndaughter-in-law (Sissy Spacek) must have\ngone through in their search for Charles in the\nface of total adversity. This, together with the\nremarkable realism, is the backbone of this\nexcellent film.\nS. Marshall (Our Man in Chile.)\nBRITANNIA HOSPITAL\nBritannia Hospital Certificate AA\nDirected by Lindsay Anderson Starring\nLeonard Rossiter, Graham Crowden,\nMalcolm McDowell Now showing ABC\nShaftesbury Avenue, Fulham Road.\nBritannia Hospital is in trouble. Pickets stop\nall but the most urgent admissions and the\nUnions halt cooked breakfasts to the private\nwing. Hospital administrator Mr Potter( Leonard Rossiter) has to prepare for a royal\nvisitor, under instruction from a dwarf and a transvestite, and a maniacal professor prepares to reveal his ultimate creation to the\nworld.\nThese are some of the scanty elements\nwhich go to produce Lindsay Anderson's latest\nblack comedy, which makes an odd trilogy out\nof // and O Lucky Man. Having seen these\nfilms you would expect a strange and humorous look at British life from the inside\u2014you certainly won't be disappointed.\nAnderson draws many characters( and\nactors) from his previous two films including\nMick Travis (the rebel schoolboy from If and\nambitious coffee salesman from 0 Lucky Man)\nplayed by Malcolm McDowell and Professor\nMillar (Graham Crowden) who develops as a brilliantly funny mam character. The Millar\nCentre is due to be opened by \" HRH\" so the\nprofessor, like a modern Frankenstein, pushes\nback the frontiers of science with scant regard\nfor human feelings to please his royal guest.\nThe film has many targets: the trade unions,\nmodern technology, royalty, the police force,\nand the media \u2014 in fact, most British institutions. It is for this reason that quite a stir\nwas caused when it was chosen as one of\nBritain's entries in the Cannes Film Festival.\nThe sick jokes and dark humour may not\nmake it popular with the establishment, but it\ndisplays all the qualities of British humour at its\nbest: cutting, introspective and well performed.\nAlthough the film is episodic (which makes it\nalmost impossible to advertise well) continuity\nis just about maintained as it races towards a moving climax.\nBy its very nature this is a film which will\ndivide the audience and the critics. But you\nshouldn't really miss the chance to see what is\nun doubt ably a major British comedy.\nMark Smith\n*76eat ne Ed (Jack Lemmon) and Beth (Sissy Spacek) look up in a stadium filled with political prisoners and\nthink they see Charles.\nThe Execution by Melissa Murray.\nPresented by Monstrous Regiment and\ndirected by Sue Dunderdale. Institute of\nContemporary Arts, The Mall.\nThe Execution, a play in the style Of a political, historical epic, follows the true story\nof the women behind the killing of Tsar Alexander II, Holy Father of All Russia. Alexander II came to the throne in 1855 and\nproclaimed a programme of social reforms,\nrelaxation of censorship, improvements in the\neducational system, trial by jury and emancipation of the serfs. But the promised\n'revolution from above' failed to materialise.\nDuring these times, higher education was\nvirtually unobtainable for women inside Russia. Those who could afford to, and who\ncould escape their families, went to universities\nin France, Germany and Switzerland, where\nthey also gained a grounding in political theory\nand philosophy, much of it from the writings of\nemigre Russian revolutionaries.\nThe play follows the lives of a small group of\nwomen from the time of an edict which ordered the return of all women students to\nRussia on the grounds that they were leading\ndissolute and immoral lives. The women returned, not merely in obedience to the Tsar,\nbut to begin their active political lives. They\nbegan by merging with the common folk,\nadopting peasant clothes and living and working in the countryside. The government\ninterpreted the movement as an attempted\nrevolution and had most of them arrested.\nHowever they were soon freed and lost no\nPage 6\n\n"

But the\nargument in this issue is moral\nand not monetarist. If we\nwere, as R.S. Alexander suggests, to reward the Argentinian aggression by\nhanding over the Islands without a light then where\nwill it end? Where next:\nGibraltar? Belize.\nThe rest of the world is\nlooking to Britain to set an\nexample and put the aggressor firmly in his place.

Alexander. Now,\nwhile I don't want to ruin the\npoor chap's wonderful article\non the Falkland's Crisis, I should just like to point out to\nhim a few home truths.\nFirstly the Falklands are\nBritish. Does he know what\nthat means? It means that\nthey are of the same blood as\nthee and me (and presumably\nhim). Did his blood not boil\nwhen he heard that a few\nthousand uniformed Gauchos\nhad stomped rudely into their\nlife, their thoroughly British\nlife, and had ordered them to\nget out or act like an Argentinian? A blatant attempt had\nbeen made by the \"pawns in\nthe power strategy of a contemptible fascist regime\"\n(as he put it) to totally convert\nthe lifestyle of the hardy islanders on this anachronistic\nremnant of bygone British\nimperialism \u2014 both phrases\nstraight from his well-worn\ncopy of the \" Little Boys\nBedside Book of Bennisms for\nBeginners\" no doubt.\nSecondly our government\nare not wasting exaggerated\nsums of money on this venture.\nThere happens to be a considerable amount of what is\ncalled \"contingency money\"\navailable which was set aside\nlor just this purpose donkey's years ago.\nThirdly I don't call six\nweeks of laborious diplomatic-pursuit of peace \"intransigence\". Maybe old R.S. would have liked to have seen\noverwhelming apathy about\nthe affair. I suppose that way\nnobody would be killed. But,\nlet's fact it, if the average\nBritish trooper was told now\nthat the government was\nbringing him home because it\nwas concerned about his\nsafety, thanks would be the\nlast thing he would proffer. I think that\" emotion less zombies\" (oh, most pictorial\nR.S.. most pictorial) in the\ngovernment happen to have\nthe backbone to realise that\nBritish people \u2014 and international law don't forget\u2014\nare worth fighting for. Yes,\nand d ving for. It's called guts.\nR.S. Fourthly. I don't really\nthink anybody can describe\nthe role of the Task Force as a mere \" national exercise\".\nThe retaking of South Georgia\nwithout loss of life and the\nlanding of British troops on\nthe Falklands recently were\nboth deeds of sheer professionalism; enough to make\nany British chest swell with\npride.\nFifthly (and I must admit\nrather pettily) R.S. is wrong\nto say that the government's course of action \"puts them in\na comparable league as the\nArgentinian junta\"; on two\ncounts. One, because he's writing tripe again and two,\nbecause one normally compares things 'with' or 'two'\nrather than 'as'. Mind you,\ntranslating Ben nite drivel isn't easy.\nLastly, let me remind him\nof that splendid mother who\nappeared on TV with a brave\nlace just 24 hours alter her son\nhad been killed on HMS Sheflield and urged Britian to\nback the Falklanders. Prats\nlike ' R.S.I can't remember\nmy department or year Alexander' can gripe and wimp\naway all they like. The Falklanders won't want to\nknow.\n1 'ours sincerely\nSimon Pettit\nLife Sci 1\nMr\nIn reply to R.S. Alexander'santi government, anti Falkland Islands and pro-Argentine letter ol last week\n( FELIX615), I note the\nfollowing:\nThe Falklands were invaded\nand occupied about seven\nweeks ago. The United Nations passed Resolution 502\nwhich told the Argentines to\nget out. This was ignored.\nArticle51 of the United Nations Charter allows for\nself-defence when invaded, which is why the Task Force\nwas sent.\nR.S. Alexander prefers a \"sensible and peaceful so lu tion\" probably running along\nthe lines of the Task Force\nwithdrawing, the Falklands\nbeing ceded to the Argentines\nand the wishes of the Islanders\nbeing ignored totally (com-m only known as sell-out). He also suggests that the Islanders\n\"should be given the chance\nof evacuation\" which will probably end up as lor ce able Page 4 FELIX, May 28, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nUNION BUILDING TO CLOSE ?\nSouthside bargain basement\noffered by College\nEditorial\nThe possible motives for agreeing to move the student\nunion facilities to the Southside Halls basement are not\nimmediately obvious to me. We should all look very closely\nat these proposals and decide whether we are really getting\na \"good deal\", as the College claims.\nAt a first impression I don't think we are, although we\nshould all be willing to listen to arguments to the contrary.\nThe immediate advantages are: firstly, the possibility of\nincreased space( with new facilities) and secondly, improved use of the Union by Southside residents.\nBut the great danger is that we will end up exchanging the\ncurrent Union Building for a converted aircraft hanger (the\nmain refectory) and a dinghy basement. We would also be\nbreaking links with the tradition of many years and the\nmove would certainly result in great changes for those\npieces of the Union Building we retain (and possibly also\nalienate former Union members).\nThere are several questions which remain to be\nanswered. How can we be certain that the facilities in\nSouthside would be an improvement on what we have\nalready? Why is the College willing to spend such large\namounts of money to move us? How will the Union Building\nbe used and could these things be done elsewhere?\nUntil all these points and many others can be cleared up\ncompletely it is perhaps unwise to discard the idea out of\nhand. But I feel that we should tread very carefully,\nespecially considering the ICU President Nick Morton\nthinks it is \" a cracking good idea\" and may well continue\nwith these plans without telling us.\nSo far he has taken the staggering attitude of \"Nanny\nknows best'' and has discussed these proposals without any\nreference to student opinion. Now that the plans are\nknown, we should be given all the details and be allowed to\nmake the decision for ourselves.\nA surprise plan to move the Student Union to the basement of\nthe Southside Halls of Residence was revealed by ICU\nPresident Mr Nick Morton last Friday. The plan would involve\nabandoning the current Union Building for use by the College\nand could cost in excess of \u00a3250,000.\nCollege Secretary Mr John Smith suggested the idea to the President\nin March and it was only last week th t the first plans were completed\nby the Estates Department. For this reason Mr Morton decided not to\ninform ICU Council until Monday or include the plans in Exec News\nfor last Tuesday's AGM. The proposals are, at present, in the very early stages of preparation\nand would need to be generally approved before any large amount of\nmoney was committed to further investigation. John Smith told\nFELIX that there was no intention of \" pulling offa coup\" and that the\nidea had only been revealed to assess the level of support.\nMr Smith commented that he had been concerned with the lack of\nuse of the lower three levels of Southside, following the closure of most\nof the Refectory facilities there. This, he said, had prompted the idea of\nmaking Southside a \"focal point of student activity\".\nBy moving the Union to the Southside basement there would be\nwhat he called \"the added advantage\" of having space available in\nBeit Quad. Mr Smith suggested three possible uses for the current\nUnion building. Firstly the top floor could be easily converted for extra\nstudent accommodation. Secondly he admitted that the College has\nbeen under pressure from the Life Sciences Division to expand their\nfacilities. The University Grants Committee( UGC) have also\ninstructed the College to increase the Life Sciences intake and this\nContinued on page 3.\nAbove: the current plan for the ground floor of Southside which now to hue removed for the club area (left) and the refectory and kitchens\ncontains the empty main refectory which was described by Mr Mooney partitioned for the sports facilities (right).

    "content": "The Southside Plan\nut\niT message i\" \u2022 J1JI1 Above: the proposed look of the level, above the Southside Bar.\nContinued from front page.\nwould necessitate an expansion of first year laboratory facilities.\nFinally, and perhaps most significantly, he feels that there is a probable use ol some areas as a \"post experience centre''. This facility\nwould consist of a number of small conference rooms (and fairly\nluxurious accommodation ) which would be hired out to senior\nmanagers in industry attending short courses to improve their\nknowledge and use of modern technology.\nMr Smith assured FELIX that the present Union Bar and Lower Lounge would remain as student areas (and perhaps even some other\nparts of the building). When asked about possible sources of finance in\nthe face of the current eco no mi^ situation he felt that an optimistic\napproach was needed and thought that il the idea was given approval\nthe College could find the money necessary.\nThe move would take place over a two year period beginning in. July1983 at the earliest, and would hence need to be included in the\nCollege budget for 1983/4. This would mean that the student union\nwould have to show considerable interest before next October and l would need to approve more detailed plans by January1983. Monday's ICU Council instructed the Executive to investigate the\nmatter further and the summer months will un doubt ably prove vital as\nfurther details emerge.\nIt seems likely that a College-wide ballot may be called for as a measure ol\" approval.\nSick Bay takes students to\nthe cleaners\nICU Council mandated future Union Executives to \"discuss further on\nthe proposed move to .Southside and report hack\" (to Council) at a meeting last Monday. Although the majority of Council did not share Nick Morton's enthusiasm lor the proposed move (see front page), they requested\nmore detailed proposals before making a final decision.\nSimilar motions were also passed on the future financing of the\nHealth Centre sick bay and a central laundry facility available to all\nstudents. However, it was pointed out that in the event of IC students\nhaving to make a compulsory \u00a3\\0 payment for the sick bay, Royal College of Music students, who also use the sick bay, would be required\nto pay also.\nThe meeting approved the conversion of the Union Lower Lounge\ninto a refectory-type area with bar and the conversion should be.\ncompleted during the summer. Most of the work will be financed by\nCollege although the Union will have to pay for the modification of the\ncurrent kitchen to the Ents Room. Miss Christine Teller was also ratified as acting Deputy President\nand the addition of her name to the DP Honours Board and Pot\nauthorised.\nThe meeting remained quo rate until it was closed, thus allowing\nmatters from as long ago as 1980 lo be noted.\n3-2-1\nQuorum!\nQuorum was successfully challenged immediately alter the\nUnion Annual General Meeting opened last Tuesday.\nHowever the crowd of over 100\nremained to see President Nick\nMorton award Union General\nAwards. These are the highest\nawards the Union can make and\nare given at the discretion of the\nPresident. U GAs were presented\nto Mr Arthur Lovcday (who is\nretiring as groundsman at the\nHarlington sports ground after\ntwenty years service), Lawrence\nWindley, Marco Led wold, Mark Smith, Christine Teller and Nick\nNfprton.\nSocial and Athletic Colours\nwere also awarded alter approval\nhv IC Council. \u00a323.00 \u00a324.00 (4.3%)\n23.00 23.00 (0%)\n21.00 22.00 (4.8%)\n20.00 20.80 (4.0%)\n17.00 17.50 (2.9%)\n17.50 17.50 (0%)\n15.50 16.00 (3.2%)\n11.50 12.00 (4.3%)\nMore rent increases\nThe following recommendations for next year's rent levels will be put\nto the Rector from Student Residence Committee.\nRooms Currently Weekly Rent Proposed rent for 1982/3\nSingles in Weeks, Linstead, Southside\nSingles in Montpelier\nSingles in New Beit\nSingles in Old Beit, Garden, Evelyn Gdns\nDoubles in Linstead\nDoubles in Montpelier\nDoubles in Beit. Garden, Evelyn Gdns\nTriples in Garden, Evelyn Gdns\nThe following points should be noted:\n1. \u00a313,000 expenditure on building insurance has been transferred\nfrom the College central account to the Student Residence Account.\n2. Re decoration and refurnish ment programmes have been\nreinstated after severe cutbacks due to financial problems this year.\n3. The Wardens entertainments allowance is to be reinstated.\n4. Allowing for extra expenditure in points 1-3, the increase in rents\nfor 1982/3 has been held to a reasonable level. This has been possible\nthanks to savings on the linen service and heating and probable\nst a bilis ation of interest rates.\nA few other matters of interest were discussed at Students Residence\nCommittee:\nA. Although S RC will continue with its own plans to upgrade\nlaundry facilities in Halls and Houses, the College centrally is looking\ninto the provision of a central communal laundry lor all. The Union President will pursue this matter.\nB.A voluntary linen hire scheme will be run in the Halls and\nHouses next year.

    "content": "The Southside Plan\nThe news of Nick Morton's great mystery\nleaked last Friday after FELIX had been\ndistributed. I'm a little surprised, not to say\nannoyed, that Morton should take such a clandestine approach to what is probably the\nmost important decision the Union has had to\nmake since its formation. He made no effort to\ninform the Union of what he and College\nSecretary John Smith have been discussing\nuntil it was too late. If he had revealed the\nplans in Exec News last Friday (which he\ncertainly should have) then perhaps we would\nhave had a packed AGM with people who\nwere willing to give their opinions on the\nscheme. As it is, we have to trust that Nick\nMorton knows what he's doing and that\nCollege won't take advantage of the way he\nhas failed to find out what people think, whilst\nhe personally is all for the idea.\nThere is no reason for a great panic or overreaction to what is, after all, only a very\ntentative idea. But we shouldn't be lulled into\ntrusting the Union or College leadership and\neverybody should try to make their opinion\nclear. As soon as more definite plans are\navailable they should be published and some\nsort of ballot, perhaps including Union Life\nMembers, should take place.\nThe whole thing could, of course, fall\nthrough if the money is not available, if\nacademic- departments object strongly (for\nfinancial reasons) or if students generally\ndisagree with the move. We cannot rely on\neither of the former, and the latter is certainly\nthe most important factor to be considered at\npresent.\nAiring Dirty Linen\nSeveral fairly important matters have been\novershadowed by The Southside Plan. It has\nbeen decided that the linen service in Halls of\nResidence is to be dropped. There is some\ndisagreement about the consequences of such\na move and the possible savings for students.\nThe main reasons for agreeing to drop the\nservice was to save money and create a large,\ncentral laundry for use by all IC students.\nWell I doubt whether it will save much\nmoney except if you don't wash the sheets at\nall. At present it costs about \u00a31 a week to have\nclean linen delivered to your door. If you\nwashed your sheets every week and\nconsidered the amount of time, effort and\ninconvenience this causes, then it would easily\nbe valued at over \u00a31.\nSecondly the Hall Wardens are divided over\nincreased laundry facilities. They seem to want\na large laundry, but for use by Hall residents\nonly. Some Wardens disagree with the idea\ncompletely and the in des pensi ble Senior\nWarden Don Monro cooked up the whole\nthing in the first place.\nIt seems very pointless to me and may be yet\nanother false economy.\nFELIX Rally\nAll is not dead at Imperial College! The\nfabulous FELIX Rally will take place on\nSunday, June 20 with clues set by Scaramouche and myself about various places in\nLondon.\nThe idea of the rally is to spend a timed\nperiod on a treasure hunt around Central\nLondon with a set of clues and map\nreferences. Teams of up to four may take part\nand pairs on motorcycles are allowed. Points\nare collected for items of treasure and clues\nsolved, and the winners will have their names\nengraved on the FELIX Rally pot.

However this is not the play's strongest message, and although it is the sort\nof play that induces different responses or\nimpressions in members of the audience, its\nlasting impression was of the sad sight of\nintelligent and calculating individuals resorting\nto desperate almost mad efforts through frustration and impatience in not seeing the\nfruits of their labours. Revolutions don't happen overnight and the characters required\nof revolutionaries who desire to usher in a more civilised society after decades or\ncenturies of habit and conditioning is one of\nalmost super-human patience.\nNick Bedding\nIC Choir members' persistence in selling\ntickets resulted in quite a good audience for\ntheir performance of Bach's St. John Passion\non May21, but pressure of exams or fear of\nPigotts (a weekend in the country to learn the\nwork) had reduced the size of the choir itself\nconsiderably from that which performed the\nVerdi Requiem before Easter.\nBoth choir and orchestra made a firm start\non the opening chorus. The altos immediately\nmade it obvious that they lacked both the clear\ntone of the sopranos and the courage of the\ntenors who, despite numbering only 10 (less\nthan half the alto population), sang with\nconviction and worked hard to balance i he larger numbers of sopranos and basses. The\nsoprano tone did deteriorate somewhat in the\nsecond half when one or two voices, audible\nabove the rest of the choir, became rather\nscreeching \u2014 notably at the shouts of'Crucify\nHim'. The basses were as reliable as ever but\nlacked some weight in the lower register.\nIn general the choir sang the chorales well\nwith a controlled balanced sound. The more\nvigorous choruses were attacked with competence although those requiring more\nagile voices were marred by a great surge of\nrelief in the closing bars.\nThe orchestra showed some disagreement\namongst the strings as to which ascending\nscale should begin one particular aria but\nproduced some lovely woodwind solos. A fine\ncontinuo was played on harpsichord cello and\norgan.\nThe most outstanding solo performance was\ngiven by Penelope Walker( contralto) in\nTennis\nKings College vs IC\n'Chains of Bondage' beautifully accompanied\nby an oboe duet. During the bass aria 'Haste\npoor souls' it was debatable whether it was the\nsoloist William Schimmel, or the choir who\nwas performing at short notice \u2014 the choir's intermittent ' Oh where?' sounding like mass\nheavy breathing. Unfortunately the tenor\nsoloist Lawrence Dale obviously thought that\nthe conductor Eric Brown knew the answer to\n'Ah my soul, what end a waite th thee?' as he\ndirected the whole of this aria (and his\nsubsequent solos) towards him. A clear\nexpressive recitative was sung by Andrew\nKing as the Evangelist. Christus was sung by\nJonathan Best and the soprano solo by\nJennifer Adams.\nGMR\nA concert gir en by the Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra in the Great Hall,\nImperial College. May 19, 1982.\nYour reviewer, after getting back from a particularly shattering day. was sitting quietly\nwaiting for the concert to begin when a very\nbeautiful red headed timpanist bounced up to\nask if I could review the concert for FELIX; never having been known to refuse a lady\nanything 1 agreed.\nThe conceit began with Berlioz's Roman\nCarnival Overture which is a highly complex\nballet than quick bowling, and croquet is not\nthat energetic. OK, so you fluke d two\ncrickets but this was a limited overs game and\nyou cannot bowl three long hops an over\ndown the leg side. You blew it. You lost IC\nthe game. I agree Bussey was also hit all\naround the park but you must take most ol\nthe responsibility yourself. Don't take it to\nheart, Bill old man. Croquet can be thrilling,\nyou know.\"\nHim n rrs skulked into a corner where he\nfound Bussey reflecting on being hit for six\nover long-off' and White contemplating how\nhe once enjoyed a game of cricket. But that\npiece of orchestration and is well suited to the\ntalents of IC SO who gave it a splendid\nrendering. The piano concerto no. 23 K488 by\nMozart followed next and illustrates further, if\nsuch illustration was required, the value of\nmusic making in this College as it allows\ntalented musicians an opportunity to display\ntheir virtuosity which they might not otherwise\nhave. The musician in this case was Damian\nWisniewski who gave a superb rendering of\nthe concerto both in delicacy in playing and in\nhis sensitive interpretation. This latter was in a very romantic mode and shows that one does\nnot have to return to 'how it must have\nsounded to Mozart' in order to produce a beautiful effect. It only requires for it to be\nplayed with sympathy and understanding for\nsuch an effect to be produced. My only\nadverse criticism of this piece was that the\nwoodwind players sometimes let the side\ndown.\nTchaikovsky's4 th Symphony provided a full\noutlet for the energetic conducting style of\nRichard Dickins (dressed in a white dinner\njacket). He controlled the orchestra through\nsome very difficult pieces especially the\npizzicato. Special reference must be made to\nthe brass section and the trumpets in\nparticular who played exactly what was\nrequired; can there be higher praise?\nAltogether it was a most enjoyable evening\nand I left feeling a lot less shattered than when I arrived.\nFrank James\nHaving arrived at Enfield TC, in Dave\nGladman's custom converted ex cort, the IC team and the Steve Will is a pj ire cia tion society had to squeeze back inside as their\ncourts were too wet to play on. There was a change of venue which obviously disturbed\nthe IC side. Gladman and M. Shepherd\nseemed to regard the first match as a warm up and lost 6-0, 6-3 whereas Willis and Phil\n(not shot) Shepherd managed to take their\nmatch to three sets, but lost 2-1.\nIn the second matches Shepherd and Gladman turned on the form and won 7-6, 4-6, 6-1. However, the other match was left\nunfinished at one set each 6-6. in pouring\nrain, howling wind and darkness at 9:30pm. Special mention to M. Shepherd's hairless\nbut shapely legs which gave him extra speed\nowing to reduced wind resistance.\nCricket\nEnfield Chase vs IC\nHimners was desperate for advice alter this\nmatch and a wise old cricketer offered him the following:\n\" Well Bill, il I were you. I would take up\ncroquet. I mean they do play that sort of\nthing in Zimbabwe where you come from,\ndon't they? Alter watching you bowl today, I really feel it is not worth your while carrying\non. Alter all. vo urbo dv is built more lor\nwas three years ago and he hasn't smiled\nsince.\nIncidentally, we were thrashed. All the\nfront line batsmen failed again, led by a stylish golden duck from Simpkin. This really\nis becoming a habit of his. We slumped lo 66\nfor 6 before Morton(45, and Bussey 21 no\nmade the score respectable. Our40 over*\nwere completed with us on 143 for 8.\nAnd then Himners bowled and you can\nguess the rest. Kings won by six wickets with\nmany overs to spare. Follow the advice of-a wise old cricketer. Bill \u2014 take up (roque t! Rock's Revenge\nAthletics\nOn May19 UL U held an athletics meeting\nat Motspur Park. UL men versus Royal Navy; Army; Kent and Thames Valley Harriers. UL women versus the Royal Navy.\nThe IC contingent was comprised of Roger\nFlynn and Karen Barnett. Both were\nsprinting in the 100m'B' string. Prior to the\nmeeting, rumours had been circulating that\nthe Navy's team were for some reason lacking\nin strength. This claim was further substantiated when Karen won the 100m'B' and Roger came second in the men's100m'B', later running a leg in the men's400m medley relay. Incidentally, U LUMen and\nwomen won the meeting.\nFELIX. May 28, 1982 Page 7\n\n"
