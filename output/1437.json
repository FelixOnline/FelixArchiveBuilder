Pyongyang releases statement: \u201cIt\u2019s just not worth it\u201d\nSINGING\nChristopher Anthony John Martin\nBorn in Exeter in 1977, Chris Martin\nsoon became aware of his prodigious musical talent when he was\nsent to harmonica lessons by his\nmother at the age of eight. His\nthen music teacher describing his abilities as \u2018fucking ace\u2019.\nChristopher soon began writing his own bluegrass harmonica\nmusic, winning the Exeter Bluegrass Championchips by age 12, the\nyoungest person ever to do so.\nDuring his second year of univer-sity, Martin was expelled for what\nhe describes as \u2018youthful jubilance\u2019,\nbut what newspapers at the time\ndescribed as \u2018indecent exposure during a tutorial\u2019. Chris later commented\non the incident in his song Driftwood\nwith the lyrics \u201cI got my cock out in the\ntutorial\u201d\nJonathan Mark Buckland\nJonathan Mark Buckland was born\nand raised on a dairy farm in Shropshire. He quickly chose a career in\nthe dairy industry, and it was only\nafter a freak lactation accident in\nwhich Buckland lost total movement of his arms that he chose\nto give up dairy in favour of a\ncareer in music (although\nto this day Buckland still\ninsists on drinking his milk\ndirectly from the cow).\nBuckland is well known\nfor being the most artistly\ncreative of the quartet, going by\nthe nickname within the band of\nJonathan \u2018Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019 Buckland. He primarily works in the medium of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, and most recently created the band\u2019s figurines for the\nvideo Life in Technicolour 2. In a recent\ninterview, Chris Martin commented:\n\u201cHe likes his papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 does our\nJonathan\u201d.\nGuy Rupert Berryman\nBorn in Toronto in 1988, Guy Berryman settled in Worthing, West Sussex\nat the age of 10 and later went on to\nstudy Physics at Imperial College\nLondon. Upon completion of his\ndegree, Berryman joined the\nNASA space program, conducting research into zero-gravity\nspectroscopic absorbtion effects\nin organic compounds. He was\nalso the first person to drink\nhis own urine in space.\nBerryman joined Coldplay\nafter meeting lead vocalist\nChris Martin in a karaoke bar,\nthe two finding common ground\nover their love of West End\nshow-tunes and singing a duet of\nMeatloaf\u2019s I would do anything for\nlove.\nWilliam \u2018Will\u2019 Champion\nWilliam Champion was born in\nMilton Keynes in 1974, the son of\nan accountant and a bookmaker.\nHis favourite subjects in school\nwere Maths and Geography. He\nwas alright at them, but never very\ngood.\nChampion\u2019s favourite colour\nis greyish beige and his favourite food is the mild cheddar cheese\nsandwich. in his spare time, Champion enjoes creating PowerPoint presentations about the television he has\nwatched, and then deleting them.\nIn a recent article written in some\npublication, Champion claimed to\nhave invented the name \u2018Coldplay\u2019, describing the process of its creation as\n\u201c...like taking a mathematical average\nof all band names, which reflects the\ntone of our music quite well, as sort of\nthe average of all music\u201d.\nWords by Peter Sinclair, heads by Sarah-Emily Mutch\nGUITAR BASS DRUMS\nColdplay\nA\nnyone who pays too\nmuch attention to my\nramblings every week or\nso will probably have noticed my general dislike\nfor generic indie-pop quartet Coldplay.\nIn the past I have used them as whipping boys for a musical ultra-main-stream whose aesthetics I sometimes\ndisagree with and often disdain. I have\nclaimed that they are the prime example of the blandness that is pumped\ninto the minds of the population via\ntelevision and radio \u2013 a soulless, emo-tionless swill created for mass consumption using corporate market research techniques and used as a means\nof making profit rather than a means of\nexpressing, well, anything whatsoever.\nA gnawing blandness which grates the\nsenses and erodes the emotion from\neveryday life.\nHowever, this being the final issue of\nfelix of the year, I thought it was time\nI got something off my chest. Despite\nthe blandness, despite the incessant\n4-4 timing of every single song, despite\nthe feeling of impending, irreversible\nloss of cognitive functioning every\ntime someone lists them as one of their\nfavourite bands, I FUCKING LOVE\nCOLDPLAY. I absolutely adore them.\nI want to shout it, proclaim it from the\ntop of the Queen\u2019s Tower \u201cI am in love\nwith Chris Martin\u201d.\nI have harboured this terrible secret\nfor so long. As the trendy music section editor of a trendy student publica-tion, I just wanted to appear edgy and\noffer an alternative perspective to the\nmainstream press, but it was all a sham\n\u2013 a sham that I am happy to rid myself\nof as I step out of the indie-pop closet.\nPhew, that feels better. While I\u2019m at\nit, I also like the Kaiser Chiefs, Two\nPints of Lager, and grating my cock\nwith a cheesegrater while wearing a\ncat-suit and whistling the French national anthem.\nYep.\nScientists have recently discovered aurora borealis to be the sun\nliterally shining out of Chris Martin\u2019s arse\nPeter Sinclair\nA discovery by scientists at University\nCollege London has proved the link\nbetween the music of Coldplay and\nworld peace.\nColdplay\u2019s lead vocalist and mod-ern-age messiah Chris Martin said in\na statement to the associated press\n\u201cThe world peace is what I got in this\nbusiness for. The fact that my music is\ngreat is merely a happy coincidence\u201d.\nHundreds of thousands of copies of\nthe popular indie band\u2019s latest album\nViva la Vida are currently being transported by container ship to volatile areas of Iraq, and massive loudspeakers\nhave been set up on the border of North\nKorea in an effort to beat Pyongyang\ninto submission. Locals have described\nthe music as \u201cdistressing\u201d.\nMusic\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhich acts to see:\nOur favorite mix of music, theatre, comedy, literature and\ncabaret returns for its fourth innings on the 16th - 19th July\nLatitude is a pretty big deal for such a\nyoung festival.

Check out the tracks \u2018Crystalised\u2019\nand their cover of Womack and Womack\u2019s \u2018Teardrops\u2019.\nPassion Pit make great summer pop\nsongs that are reminiscent of past\ntimes, while also sounding fresh and\nexciting. The first album from the\nMassachusett\u2019s \u2018Manners\u2019 is loud, fun\nand full of great pop songs.\nThey may lack depth, and wear their\ninfluences on their sleeves, but when\nthe sun is out and the cider\u2019s flowing\nwho cares.\nLead singer of Radiohead. Ridiculously\nfamous and rightly so. I once met in a\nrecord shop and he signed a 7\u201d for me\n\u2013 best birthday present I\u2019ve ever had.\nThis will be his first solo set since\nthe release of Eraser. Does this suggest\ntheir might be something new soon?\nWild Beasts\u2019 specific brand of indie is\nboth nostalgic and refreshing in one\nbite sized piece.

I am, of course, talking about\nthe Imperial College Union Colours\nceremony where hacks acknowledge\nthe hackery of other hacks.\nThe ceremony included food, as\nwell as numerous bottles of wine and\nbeer, which they didn\u2019t touch (we did\nthough, it would be a great shame to let\nsuch a fine selection of food and drink\ngo to waste!).\nA range of hack species went up to\ncollect their certificates, each showing various levels of appreciation for\ntheir award, with the few non-hacks\nin the room looking baffled as to why\nthey bothered turning up just to collect a piece of paper, well apart from\nthe food and drink of course! The non\nhacks in the room, once receiving their\ncertificates, proceeded to the back of\nthe room, picked up a bottle of wine\nand swiftly left the room, mush to the\ndisapproval of the spotty faced gimps\nsitting in the Union Dining Hall.\nAlthough this is traditionally a ceremony where hacks congratulate each\nother, this was the first time that a\nhack managed to congratulate himself!\nRay Charles, current RCSU President,\nawarded himself RCSU Fellowship for\n\u201coutstanding service to the RCSU and\nkeeping the RCSU performing better\nand better each year. [Dave] has been\nawesome keeping the RCSU going, and\nsupporting me/science challenge very\nstrongly.\u201d\nThis is literally a chase of giving\nyourself a pat on the back!\nIf you want to stop this sort of\nstuff happening, then make sure\nyou nominate people for the\naward next year!\nScandalous\nNews Correspondent\nThe hack filled Union Dining Hall last Thursday where the Colours\nceremony took place. It was really fun!\nMore Colours\nRecreational Club\nCommittee Colours\nHalf Colours\nJim Carr\nSimon Chard\nWill Dugdale\nJonathan Feldman\nRory Fyffe\nSamuel Groth\nTom Haywood\nAndy Parsons\nRobert Porter\nJoseph Rumer\nKapil Sugand\nEduardo Vasquez\nAriadne Whtiby\nJiri Zita\nFull Colours\nBen Banfield\nNathaniel Bottrell\nAndrew Cockerill\nHilary Dyer\nPaul Hutton\nRishi Makhecha\nAbeed Visram\nGrace Yip\nSocial Clubs Committee\nColours\nFull Colours\nAlex Cameron\nKristina Ostman\nMelissa Loh\nJayna Mistry\nNikita Gandhi\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nNext week the UK Parliament will elect a new\nspeaker to the House of\nCommons.\nUsually the speaker is\nelected after a new Parliament has formed following a general election,\nand the current speaker\nMichael Martin has retained his post since 2000.\nBut following unprecedented scenes last month\nwhen MPs were openly\ncalling for his resignation\nover the ongoing expenses scandal, Mr Martin announced he was standing down on 21 June.\nThis week hustings took place between 10 candidates as they put forward\ndiffering programmes for creatively reforming parliament and wider parliamentary culture, which has been called by one candidate \u201cprofoundly old-fashioned, male and frequently boorish\u201d. The speaker should theoretically\nbe politically neutral and be above party politics, which is partly why MPs\nwill vote in a secret ballot.\nThe deep rooted corruption over claiming expenses has shocked not just\nBritons, but many around the world. This is because the UK Parliament \u2013\nformed in 1707 - is often considered the \u201cMother of Parliaments\u201d and many\nother countries have parliaments based on its \u201cWestminster system.\u201d\nUnited Kingdom\nNine million people are at risk of severe food shortages in Ethiopia, as\nthe UN runs out of food aid.\nThe UN\u2019s World Food Program distributes the food to Ethiopia\u2019s poorest,\nwho are hugely dependent on it for their sustenance. The UN says further\nsupplies are not expected to arrive for another five months. Landlocked\nEthiopia lies in Eastern Africa, and relies on the neighbouring country of\nDjibouti for its supply line, but Djibouti\u2019s port is overflowing and congested.\nThe next three months in Ethiopia are usually the hardest of the year, as\nfarmers await the harvesting season in September. The government is said\nto have prioritized imports of fertilizers to increase the harvest. The Ethiopian ambassador to the UK has said that his country is not facing a food\ncrisis, and that food was being delivered by truck from Sudan.\nEthiopia\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nThe results of last Friday\u2019s elections in Iran\nhave sparked huge rallies\nin the capital Tehran.\nThe incumbent, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, won almost\n63%of the vote, while his\nmain opposition rival MirHossein Mousavi garnered\n34%. Voter turnout was\nstaggeringly high, at 85%\nof the voting population.\nAlleged voting irregularities reported by the opposition party, have since\ntriggered protests in the capital Tehran. Over the course of the week the\nprotests have grown larger, and more violent, resulting in the deaths of at\nleast eight people in clashes with the police. Supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have also staged protests in the capital, with masses of people\ncoming in from the countryside, where most of his support base resides.\nWhile international observers have urged restraint and are waiting to see\nhow the situation develops, Iran\u2019s media has been censored, foreign journalists have been banned, and protest leaders have been arrested. The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is actually the head of state, has\ncalled for unity, and is expected to make a pivotal speech at Friday afternoon\nprayers on 19 June.\nIran\nFor the first time in years, first and second year Materials have had all of their\nexams squashed into one week. You\nmay think \u2018that\u2019s not so bad \u2013 Materials people took a soft option anyway,\nwhy are they complaining?\u2019\nFor second years, it was Bad. Last\nyear, the exams were spread out over a\ncouple of weeks at the beginning of the\nthird term, then a fairly hardcore, but\nrelaxed case study with a final report\nand presentation worth 30% of the final coursework grade due in the last\nfew weeks of term. They could put in\nas much or as little effort as they liked,\nwithout having to worry about whether or not it would affect their exam results as well.\nNot so this year. With the case study\ndeadline two days before the exams\nstarted, the time that most students\nfelt was necessary to complete the\ncoursework to a satisfactory standard\nwas distinctly lacking. Revision was\nfraught with the worry that the case\nstudy wouldn\u2019t be handed in on time\nor up to scratch.\nFriday (deadline day) came and went,\nand they entered their exam week.\nMaths on Monday, the exam lots of\npeople were most worried about because everyone knows that maths isn\u2019t\nabout revision \u2013 it\u2019s about practice.\nThe exam itself went pretty smoothly,\nthere were a few minor mistakes, everyone came out tired, pissed off (in\nsome cases) and ready for the next\nround.\nChemistry on Tuesday \u2013 everything\nwent smoothly, though there was some\nworry about a question in Section B,\nwhich came up with an answer that\nhad a magnitude that seemed unrea-sonable. A question was raised, the lecturers came back with a new value for\na constant that had changed from 10-1\nto 10-17. Values were recalculated,\nand an even worse order of magnitude\ncame out. The constant was checked\nMaterials exams end\nwith massive epic fail\nDe La Beche\nagain. It was actually 10-1.\nWednesday was Mechanics. Matrices question, which some people spent\nliterally hours working on \u2013 in one\ncase an entire exam booklet was filled\nwith working out. Somebody raised a\nquery and the lecturer responsible for\nthe question came and changed a value\nin the paper which changed the whole\nmatrix from asymmetric to symmet-ric. People who asked for extra time\nwere denied it, despite the fact that the\nquestion had been completely impossible and the error was corrected relatively late into the exam.\nMicrostructure and Properties was\napproached on Thursday, with everyone thoroughly sick and tired of ex-ams, and hoping for a better day with\nthe exam papers. It wasn\u2019t flawless \u2013\nthere were a couple of misprints but\nnothing major and everyone came out\nlooking forward to the last day of exams (if not for the exam, for the drinking afterwards!)\nWas it too much to hope that Physics on Friday would be a perfect paper?\nMost people certainly thought so as\nthey sat down and started to write the\npaper, but it quickly became apparent\nthat this exam was EASY. The answers\nwere easy to find, it was almost as if\nthey had been thought about previously and come straight to mind. The\nmore observant realised the obvious\ntruth long before the admin did.\nSo when the head exams dude\nwalked into the exam room and announced that the paper was the wrong\none, you can imagine the atmosphere\nin the room. Instead of managing to\nprint this year\u2019s paper, last year\u2019s paper had been given to them; hence the\n\u2018easiness\u2019 of it. Everyone was kicked\nout and told to come back at eleven to\nstart 2009\u2019s paper. Imagine it for a mo-ment. You\u2019re writing possibly the easiest exam of your life and had a bitch of\na week. You\u2019re maybe half an hour off\nfinishing, and are looking forward to a\nquiet pint in the union, already imagining the freedom. Suddenly, you find\nout that no, it\u2019s not the right paper, you\nhave to start again.\nYou have to ask some questions\nabout this. How hard is it to check the\npaper you\u2019ve printed is for the right\nyear? And if it isn\u2019t, how does it take\nforty minutes to realise you\u2019ve given\neveryone the wrong paper? One of the\nlecturers even corrected a typo in the\npaper \u2013 a correction he must surely\nhave had to make last year. We go to\nwhat is supposedly one of the top universities in the country \u2013 how is it possible that mistakes like this are made?\nAnd if there are mistakes that make\nquestions impossible to answer, how is\nit fair that people don\u2019t get extra time?\nWe\u2019re not suggesting that they\nshould have let us carry on with the\nexam and given high marks for those\nwho\u2019d done it before, but the mistake\nshouldn\u2019t have been made in the first\nplace. Some of the lecturers seem to\nhave gone out of their way to make it\nimpossible to get through the end of\nthe year without feeling like crap at\nsome point, and are actually punishing\neveryone. Maybe some people need\nto be punished for not working hard\nenough, but what about those who\nhave?\nWe would like to see a significant improvement next year across the board\nfor all Materials (bear in mind the current second year gave feedback which\nimproved the first year for this year\u2019s\nFresher\u2019s \u2013 where was the feedback\nthat improved it for us??) and hope\nthat these circumstances will be taken\ninto account when they give us our\ngrades.\nHeather Jones\nDavid Birch\nAnuja Shah\nAmar Shah\nAlbert Kang\nAnd the SCC Prize to the Cheese\nSociety, with an honourable mention to the Debating Society.\nRoyal College of Science Colours\nHalf Colours\nVazquez Garcia, Ignacio\nEdward Poynton\nMatthew Taylor\nRay Pang\nFull Colours\nHemal Bosamia\nShappy Guo\nKatherine Gray\nJackie Fok\nOutstanding Service Award\nOliver Rogers\nAndreas Esau\nVicky Erickson\nRCSU Fellowship\nKatya Vyas\nDavid Charles\nJad Marroche\nJenny Morgan\nRCSU President\u2019s Award\nMarc Coury\nLauren Anderson Dring\nChristina Flanagan\nEven more pats on the back for various individuals, this time from the\nRecreational Clubs Committee, the Social Clubs Committee and the\nRoyal College of Science Union.

When I write summer I mean that precious time of the\nyear when London gets more rainfall\nthan during any of the other quarters,\nwhen college and coursework and exams seem nothing but a very bad, very\nlong and slightly too realistic dream\nand when faraway lands beckon with\nthe promise of real adventure meeting\nthe primeval and usually barbarian locals in places as exotic as New Cross\nor Brixton.

It\u2019s not often that you get to\nsee a sequel of a drama movie, but the\noriginal Transformers film portraying\nthe ups and downs of adolescence and\nwhat it means to have a \u2018cool\u2019 car, was\nso successful that the producers decided to bless us with more. But probably\nmost surprising for its daring subject\nis the adaptation of the 20th Century\nclassic, the \u2018G.I. Joe\u2019 graphic novels.\nThemes of death, loyalty and courage\nhave not yet been approached in the\nmanner that director Stephen Sommers has in store for us.\nFor those with younger brothers,\nsisters or other relations, Hollywood\nhas decided to team up with teachers\nand scientists this summer to bring\nyou real educational gems. Everyone\u2019s\nfavourite Ice Age is now set in the dinosaur era so that little kids can familiar-ise themselves with the Earth\u2019s biggest,\nscariest and strongest reptiles. For the\nslightly older kids and teens Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince will provide the perfect way to keep their phys-ics, chemistry and biology knowledge\nfresh over the vacation.\nUnfortunately, the sudden urge to\nmake consequential and momentous\nmovies did not spread throughout\nHollywood as widely as one might\nhave hoped. Hence, there are a number\nof films you might wish to avoid. In\nparticular, keep clear of the mundane\nand drab Sunshine Cleaning, the unoriginal and disappointing Lars von\nTrier film Antichrist. There is also the\nironically titled Tenderness with an\nout-of-this-world plot and novice cast\nthat spells \u2018fiasco\u2019. And beware not to\nmake the mistake of getting tickets for\nthe French Mesrine: Killer Instinct \u2013\nthe trailers look dreadful.\nIn the name of Jonathan Dakin and\nmyself, I would like to say goodbye to\neveryone who skimmed through the\nfilm section from time to time. It\u2019s\nbeen a great pleasure to write for you\nand we really hope you enjoyed the re-views. Have a great summer.\nP.S. Please don\u2019t think that the irony\nof placing this column piece next to a\nreview of the three star rated Terminator is lost on me. My only excuse is the\nfamous phrase \u2018to each his own\u2019.\nThis film is probably more famous\nfor the on-set rants of its star than\nanything else. Who hasn\u2019t heard about\nChristian Bale screaming an f-word\nladen tirade against a member of the\ncrew for minutes on end? It is a shame\nthat this incident has cast a shadow\nover the movie itself, because it is a\nthoroughly enjoyable and fast-paced\naction adventure.\nSet in an alternative future, John\nConnor, a survivor of the robot induced holocaust, is fighting against his\ncyber foes in order to keep the human\nrace alive. If you don\u2019t know the plots\nfrom the three films that preceded this\none, then perhaps it is about time you\nwatched them (definitely the first two).\nAfter his mother survived a killer robot\nplayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in\nthe first movie, a teenage John Connor\njoins forces with Arnie in the second to\nfend off another killer robot. The third,\nin my mind never happened, mainly\nbecause of the absurdly stupid ending,\nwhich led John into the destroyed future where robots have awareness and\ndecide humanity is their biggest threat\n\u2013 and so try to wipe humans out.\nSo we begin the movie with a few human survivors fending off attacks from\nall kinds of assorted robot villains: robot humanoids, robot human catch-ers, robot aeroplanes and even robot\nmotorbikes (which are really cool).\nTrying desperately to fulfil the prophesy that he would one day destroy the\nrobot overlords, Connor (played by a\nvery serious Bale), has to save his father who is not yet his father in a pre-established time paradox from the first\nfilm, with the help of stranger Marcus\n(Worthington). The action mainly focuses on Marcus\u2019 exploits, and this is\nsupposedly because the part of Connor was originally meant to be a small\ncameo, until Bale decided to pad it out\nand give himself an equally starring\nrole. Helping Marcus is sexy pilot Blair\n(Bloodgood) who provides the female\neye-candy against the often topless\nMarcus. Will they be able to save Connor\u2019s father, and at the same time destroy the robots who are trying to wipe\nthem out?\nTerminator: Salvation is a non-stop\nexciting and thrilling two hour action\nfilm, and if the idea of a fast paced action adventure doesn\u2019t float your boat,\nthen don\u2019t bother watching it. The action sequences last for a significantly\nlong time and in this reviewer\u2019s opinion this is a good thing because they\nare very enthralling and exhilarating.\nSometimes the camerawork is annoying as there are very fast and choppy\nmoments of editing, but overall the\nfilm really shines because of its action\nset pieces. The cast give solid although\ntwo dimensional performances: Bale\nand Worthington are stern but like-able, and Bloodgood proves she is\nmore than just an attractive add-on. At\nplaces the script is tacky and cheesy;\nespecially when Bale says the infamous\ncatchphrase \u2018I\u2019ll be back\u2019: at this point a\nwatching.\nOverall, this is a solid action film, and\nif you like action films then you should\ndefinitely see it. If you like Terminator\nfilms then I would also recommend\nit, even though, in my mind, the Terminator series ended with the second\none (and the third one doesn\u2019t exist), as\nthere are enough references to the other films, including a shocking cameo.\nI pretended this wasn\u2019t related to the\nfirst two Terminator films, because to\nTerminator:Salvation HHHKK\nDirector: McG (what a name!)\nWriter: John D.Brancato\nMichael Ferris\nCast: Christian Bale,\n\tSam Worthington,\n\tMoon Bloodgood\n(I kid you not, that\u2019s\nher given name!)\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nThe new Terminator\nsaves the franchise?\ngroan erupted in the auditorium.\nThe fact that this is the fourth instalment of the Terminator franchise\nmakes one wonder how they could do\nanything unique or different to what\nthey have already done in the previous\nfilms. But the setting of post apocalyptic robot-controlled war zone is an\ninteresting one, and it gives the film\na strong and dangerous environment\nfor the audience to explore along with\nthe characters, a feature that keeps you\ndo so would be heresy (the bomb still\nwent off \u2013 what the hell was the point\nin the first place???), so ignoring the\nfact this film is destroying their legacy,\nI just pretended this was unrelated and\nsat back and enjoyed it.\nIt\u2019s a really good film, but I have a\nfeeling you will only agree with this\nopinion if you like explosions, shoot-ing, sexy women and people being\nchased: all the essentially key ingredients of a good action film.\nOr can the Terminator: Salvation box office results be ascribed\nsolely to Christian Bale\u2019s five minute freak-out on the set?\nBruno will do for the image of Austria, what neither Hitler or Fritzl\nmanaged to achieve... How will they ever pay him back?\n20 felix Friday 19 June 2009\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editors \u2013 Rosie Grayburn & Afonso Campos\nAfonso Campos\nFood Editor\nWant curly fries\nwith that?\nA\nnd this is how it ends...\nno tears, no kicking and\nscreaming and as usual\nan unmet deadline. Writing this as Jov furiously\nCMYKs a hundred million different images reminds me that this is actually the\nlast issue. It makes me sad that for the\nnext however many weeks there isn\u2019t going to be something keeping me awake\non a Wednesday evening or getting me\nout of bed on Friday mornings.\nI\u2019m not usually a sentimental guy \u2013the\nlast time I felt any emotion was probably when I was starving coming out of\nmy mother\u2019s womb (does hunger constitute an emotion or a state of being?)...\nas such I will try to keep this last editorial as corniless as possible under the\ncircumstances.\nThis year, the newspaper saw old editors flourish and become more settled,\nmore sure of their own writing and\ntheir stance on issues. It saw an influx\nof amazing new editors too. The technology and music pages have been sensational week and week on end and the\nguys (and girl) editing them could not\nbe more awesome. They have come into\nwhat can oftentimes be a rather stifling\nenvironment for a newcomer and found\ntheir place in a heartbeat. I am happy to\nhave worked alongside them for many\nhours this year. I hope they stick around\nof the wallpaper at my gran\u2019s house in\nSomerset. It has that rustic and antique\nquality to it that the connoisseurs of\ngreat and ancient wallpaper design\ngo nuts for. For me however, what\nmakes the place special is that surreal feeling of being back at boarding\nschool\u2026 long communal benches and\ntables. Nothing says intimacy like enjoying a delicious meal surrounded by\nstrangers. In this manner of new-wave\ndining, I am able to obtain constructive criticism from randoms about my\nconversations with a significant other.\nIf I start swearing or mentioning her\nweight, I can almost always observe a\nface of disapproval or disgust nearby\nthat helps me give up the subject and\nsteer my conversation to something\nless obnoxious. Genius.\nAnd speaking of dining, food at daVinci\u2019s is clearly the highlight. The\nrestaurant has recently been known\nto be operating a recession-proof\nlunch menu from 12 to 2. One is able\nto choose from a huge variety of international haute cuisine dishes at very\naffordable prices. Food names like\n\u2018chicken chausser\u2019 are bound to be a hit.\nIf the names don\u2019t do it for you though,\nthe sight of the delicacies placed upon\nthe silver trays will most definitely do.\nIt is rare to see \u2018noir french fries\u2019 in\nmost places, but this restaurant manages to carbon cook them to perfection on almost daily basis. Served\nwith \u2018radioactive orange\u2019 chicken the\nvibrant colours really are quite spec-tacular. The manager obviously takes\nyour health into account and insures\nportions remain smaller than a baby\u2019s\nfist just like all the supermodels love\n(fact: Imperial breeds supermodels).\nI felt at all times engaged by this eating experience. I think my favourite\npart was queuing for the food. It made\nme feel like part of a secret society of\nthinkers and intellectuals that do not\nneed anyone to do anything for them.\nIndependent thought is the phrase of\nthe day here; the restaurant constantly\nreminds us that good things come\nonly through hard work.\nThe dinner menu is an even more\nupscale. An absolutely unforgettable evening can easily be had. Everything on the menu is cooked to or-der. When I say cooked, I mean put\nin the microwave for thirty seconds,\nbecause management is clearly in tune\nwith your time constraints and is fully\naware of your busy life. Cooking from\nscratch would be too detrimental to\nyour schedule. Consistency in serving\ntimes is something that all the staff\nseem to be proud of.\nThe staff are usually elegant and\nspeak to you in completely unbroken English an astounding 15% of\nthe time. They are clearly happy to\nserve fellow students and friends in\nwhat is not a completely humiliating experience. If you have never\nbeen before I have to suggest the famous french traditional \u2018mixed platter\u2019 which includes a myriad of different deep fried foods. It is hard to tell\nwhat they are by taste or sight, but I\nassume this was a deliberate choice by\nthe chef in an attempt to engage the\ndiner with all senses and enjoy an experience that resembles discovering a\nnew country. Each bite is preceded by\na little bit of fear, which definitely gets\nthe adrenaline going. With enough\ncare, I make out what seem to be onion rings. They are cooked in 3 week\nold oil. People around you may be saying that the oil should be brand new,\nbut you known deep down they are\nuncultured noveau-riche who do not\nunderstand tradition and have no idea\nwhat a coat of arms is. They do not\nunderstand that just like meat needs\nto be hung for a few weeks for maximum taste, oil must follow a similar\nprocess. They probably also do not\nenjoy the great feeling this delectable meal leaves in your stomach for\nthe next three days. I for one understand the chef\u2019s psyche and know for a\nfact he wants the restaurant to leave a\nlasting impression on you. Overall,\nthere is nothing to fault about this\nplace and I must congratulate whoever runs it. I shall return soon but not\ntoo soon for I am still overwhelmed.\nBravo!\nF\nor many decades now, the\nImperial College elite (read\nbest, brightest, richest, pret-tiest, skinniest) has been\ndining in style while you\u2019ve\nbeen stuck in the MDH, JCR or SCR.\nI am absolutely sure that as avid readers of this section you are included\nin this intangible elite, and have been\nlucky enough to try out the wide selection of food available daily at daVinci\u2019s.\nWhile this outstanding review is quite\npossibly a complete and utter moot\npoint, I still think it is worth singing\nhigh praise to this most venerable of\nplaces, where anyone who is anyone\nhas ever sat down for a meal with the\ninherent capacity to change lives.\nThere are a few things I would very\nmuch like to put on a pedestal in this\nlittle but hopefully enlightening piece.\nThese include but are not limited to:\nthe atmosphere and setting, the food\nquality and the service. The familiarity with this trifecta of aforementioned details is obviously ubiquitous\nthroughout the campus, but again, not\nenough can be said about the place as\na whole.\nFrom the second one walks into the\nrestaurant, one is inundated by a feeling of calm, happiness and familiarity. I\nam not one hundred percent sure what\ndoes it for me, but perhaps it has something to do with the black walls and\nblue LEDs. Maybe it\u2019s the absolutely delightful wallpaper that reminds me\nServes 4\n2 tbsp Harriet Harman\n1 red faced Hazel Blears\n2 cloves of Jacqui Smith\u2019s garlic breath\n400g cooked duck (Tory duck house reared)\n150g frozen salaries\nHandful of \u201cwithin the rules\u201d\n200g of church donations\n6 MPs, disgraced\nIn a large frying pan, throw Jacqui Smith\u2019s porn videos and cook\nuntil soft and golden. Add a mixture of public outrage and opportunism from fringe political parties like the BNP\n. Cook until the\nnext General Election, or until the Cabinet get the balls to stab\nGordon in the back.\nAs soon as the expenses scandal hits the front pages, pretend\nthat you have always railed against political corruption and re-brand yourself as a reformer. Place your proposals under a hot\ngrill for 2 minutes and then introduce proportional representation\nthoughtlessly with no care for the consequences.\nExpensesScandal\nSalad\nfor next term as well. As it is inevitable,\nsome of the awesome staff here is leav-ing, probably to count money at some\ninvestment bank or build tree houses in\nNorfolk... wherever they are going, and\nwhatever they are going to do, I wish\nthem the best of luck.\nThis actually opens up many vacancies\nhere. I do hope that if you ever had any\ninclination to write for felix, you do. Getting involved in this thing at the beginning of my first year was the best thing\nI have done at this foresaken university\n(and also possibly the silliest). In fact,\nFood is looking for a new editor as I will\nbe venturing on to something new and\ndifferent come the next academic term.\nIf you have a passion for gastronomy or if\nyou just enjoy all the pleasures of eating\nand its benefits, get in touch. It would be\ngreat to have you around. You may even\nbe able to score free meals at some of the\ncity\u2019s best restaurants and get to review\nthem. Next year is Felix\u2019s 60th anniversary and even though Dan, the new editor still, has not officially taken over, it is\nshaping up to be incredible.\nIt\u2019s all over. Drop the books, ditch the\nnerdy glasses and have an amazing holi-day. Be bold. Eat horses\u2019 testicles, drink\nsnake blood, nibble on scorpions, imbibe\nrice wine in Indonesia... whatever you do,\ndo something different. It sounds long,\nbut 15 weeks are over in a heartbeat.\nHaute cuisine at daVinci\u2019s\nAlfonson Camponan visits Imperial\u2019s best kept secret\ndaVinci\u2019s HHHHH\nImperial Colle Union, SW7 2BB\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org\nBest bits: The people, the food,\nthe atmostphere... too much to\nmention.\nWorst bits: Not having any bad\nthings to say about it for the\nreview\nPrice: \u00a395 inc. canned drinks\nDiners deep in thought... just what the chef ordered...\n21\nFriday 19 June 2009 felix\n\n"

Their\nnames span the alphabet from aikido to wushu, and their geographical\norigins range from South America to\nFar East Asia. On Sunday they all got\ntogether for an afternoon of practice\nsessions at Ethos. Four clubs ran a\none-hour workshop each, to introduce the others to their martial art.\nThe day literally kicked off with tae\nkwon do, one of the few martial arts\nplayed at the Olympics. The tae kwon\ndo club led the warm-up and stretching as well as the first session. The\nclub set a high pace and really pushed\nus hard. Very soon all 30 participants were dripping with sweat while\nthrowing kicks and punches at the\npads offered by the instructors. Under their supervision and encouragement we progressed quickly to more\nand more advanced techniques until\nwe were finally let loose on each other\nfor a gentle round of sparring.\nThe second session introduced ken-do, a sport derived from the ancient\nJapanese swordsmanship. As kendo\nplayers use bamboo swords and wear\nfull body armor this session was in\ninteresting contrast to the previous\nunarmed discipline. Starting from\nbasic food work, we soon were given\nour own bamboo sword to practice\nthe typical kendo posture, the striking distance and of course the loud\nJapanese battle cry. After extensively\nyelling at each other while maintaining the correct attacking distance, the\nsession was concluded by two fully\narmored kendo players who demonstrated some of their skills.\nWith sore throat and aching muscles everybody quickly grabbed\nhomemade muffins and lots of water\nbefore heading straight into the third\nC\nontinuing in a Telegraphesque fashion with the\nfarce that is the ACC\nColours ceremony, felix\nsport have been inundated with letters supporting our stance.\nOne certain club member has commented on another club member who\nhappened to receive colours, chiming\n\u201cBack then, I used to think s/he was fit,\nthen I thought s/he was OK, but now\nI think s/he is well rank and fucking\nannoying.\u201d Moving on, another letter\nwe received commented on Samuel\nFurse. Summing up \u201c... he\u2019s a fraud, he\u2019s\nfriends with someone called Tarquin\nand he doesn\u2019t need any more money\nfrom the union to play polo with NesJack Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nSatirical End ofYear Review\ntor Kirchner and family.\u201d\nHis crony Joseph Lees received similar abuse: \u201cHow can you give the basketball team two grand extra when you\nhave attracted less and less students,\nyear-on-year for the past few years.\nWhat are you, dyslexic?\u201d\nSport Imperial might have informed\nus that to celebrate the achievements of\nboth the Netball and Rugby Women\u2019s\n1sts, they have organised along with\nBUCS, trials for the England Universities squads in their respective sports.\nYou heard it here first ladies.\nLike French, Spanish, Italian and\nJapanese level 1 language classes, the\nunion have finally taken heed and now\nhold the view that the Royal School of\nMines sports teams are utterly useless\nand should either be offloaded to the\nequally useless Royal Veterinary College or subsumed amongst the college\nteams, if they can get into the lowest\nteams that is.\nSimilar in manner to David Charles\u2019\nself-awarding of an RCSU fellowship, I\nwould like to congratulate myslef on an\noutstanding year as sports editor. My\ninput on the ACC scandal was not only\ninformative but relevant and balanced\nin approach and delivery.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 19 June 2009\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 James Goldsack & Katya-yani Vyas\nAbove: the old Union logo with the new one below it\nHaxor McRandy\nHacks spend hours arguing\nover \u00a31 for IC Boat Club\nMajor changes in Union\nPolitical structure\nAt the last meeting of the Imperial\nCollege Union Council, some major\nchanges were made to the Constitution\nand the management structure. After\na 15-hour meeting, which included\na heated debate over a new Imperial\nCollege Union logo and its slogan, the\nCouncil finally agreed upon certain\nchanges to the Constitution, document which governs the running of the\nUnion.\nOne of the major changes included\nchanging the Union\u2019s logo from the\n\u2018Blue Swish\u2019 to the new and improved\n\u2018Block\u2019 design, as can be seen in the\npicture adjacent. The biggest protest to\nthe new logo came from Deputy President (Finance & Services), Christian\nCharles Elizabeth Chigsworth Carter,\nwho questioned the grammar used in\nthe new slogan \u201cActualising student\npotential; always\u201d, however, after con-soltation with the felix Editor, Jovan\n\u017darko Kalashnikov Nedi\u0107, it was found\nthat \u201cboth the speling and gramer was\nperfect [sic x 10].\u201d\nOther changes that were made included changes to Page 3, Section A,\nPart X, Paragraph 12, line 2, word 9 of\nthe constitution where they changed it\nto \u2018there\u2019 and Page 3, Section A, Part X,\nParagraph 12, line 3, word 12 to \u2018sexual\nneeds\u2019, so that the whole paragraph\nnow reads:\n\u201cThe Deputy President (Education\n& Welfare) will be there for the sexual\nneeds of the students of Imperial College Union.\u201d\nOne student welcomed the changed\nsaying that the current DPEW is \u201cwell\nhot innit bro\u201d and that he would \u201csmash\nthat!\u201d. However, one second year medical student said that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch\nthe new DPW (Jonathan Silver) with a\nbarge pole. This is just an attempt by\nthe Union hacks to get with some girls\nwhen we all know that they haven\u2019t got\na chance in hell. It\u2019s nothing more than\nstudent politics gone mad!\u201d\nAlthough there was some criticism\nof the decisions made in Council, most\nof them have been ignored with Council Chair Afonso Costa Campos explaining that \u201cthe numbers lodging the\ncomplaint were nor quorate and thus\ntheir motion was unable to be eligible\nin Council\u201d. Many senior hacks have\ndoubts over this decision and are looking into the strange activities of Mr\nCamp(os), which include buying the\nelection in which he won the Council\nChair last year (felix Issue 1,405).\nIn other news, there have been rumours that next year\u2019s ICU President\nAshley Brown, has decided to drastically change the personnel at the Union. Every member of staff has been\nfired, except for the felix Editor elect as\nMr Brown is scared of what the man\ncan do, and have been replaced by\nOompa Loompas. Mr Brown told felix\nthat:\n\u201cIt was the logical solution in the\ncurrent economic climate. Mr Wonka\nclearly demonstrated that Oompa\nLoopmas were very diligant and loyal\nworkers, and that they would obey\nwhatever their master would say.\u201d\nAlthough this is a bold move by the\nbawlding President-elect, many question whether or not this was just an\nattempt to make him feel bigger than\nhe really is. This fact has mainly been\noverlooked as more students were concerned as to what the Union would be\nserving. When asked about this, Mr\nBrown told felix that:\n\u201cWe will open a new confectionary\nshop in the Union to take advantage of\nthe skills of the Oompa Lumpas, how-ever, we will also be aiming to improve\nthe quality of service offered throughout the Union, including Entertainment, Catering and Finance.\u201d\nOnly time will tell if the promises\nmade by Mr Brown will be true.\n(ED: Most or all of the facts in this\narticle are false, however, some of it is\ntrue. Find out more next year, possibly!)\nAshley Brown with his new working force\nWayne Kerr\nThe Hacks, see definition courtesy of\nLive! had one of their best meetings a\ncouple of weeks ago when the Clubs\nand Societies Board (CSB) met to discuss budget appeals.\nFrom the Athletics Club Committee\n(ACC), two clubs logged an appeal in\nthe hope of getting a larger grant than\nthey were originally assigned by the\nACC Chair and the ACC Treasurer\nearlier that month. The Football Club\nasked for an increase of \u00a31,400 to cover\ntheir large travel expendatures, whilst\nthe Boat Club asked for \u00a33,350 more\nafter they felt hard done by when they\nonly received roughly \u00a310,000 of the\n\u00a370,000 they asked for (Ed: they were\nnever going to get the full amount!).\nIt was decided that the Football Club\nwould receive the full amount, howev-er, the initial claim of \u00a33,350 from the\nBoat Club was rejected. There is no\ndoubt in anyone\u2019s mind that the Boat\nClub contribute greatly to the College, bringing in more BUCS points\nthan the rest of the clubs combined\n(a fact they know far too well!), and\nthey need the money to continue this\nDictionary\nhack |h\u00e4k|\nnoun\n1: Within Imperial College Union, a hack\nis one intensely involved in union politics,\nusually with an unhealthy knowledge of the\nunion\u2019s procedures or constitution. Hacks\ntend to form a clique, which may seem impenetrable to outsiders. Any members of\nthe student media covering political issues\nare also hacks, by virtue of understanding\nwhat is going on. (Ed: except felix writers!)\nOrigin: live.cgcu.net\nH\nhigh standard. After hours of arguing,\nwhich included certain Hacks arguing\nthat certain changes were not consti-tutional, the CSB eventually decided to\ngive the Boat Club \u00a33,349, \u00a31 less than\nthey originally asked for.\nThis writer wonders what was the\nfucking point of wasting so much time\nfor a pound. Hacks fail yet again!\nH\ne\u2019s 10 feet 5 inches tall,\nyou know, and that\u2018s\nwithout shoes on. I\u2019m\ntalking about Barack of\ncourse, who else? Yes,\nI can call him Barack, we are on first\nname terms, and no, you cannot, he\ndoesn\u2019t like you.\nIn other news, Brown (Gordon, not\nAshley, you silly silly hacks) was seen\nbuying large quantities of compost last\nweek lending credibility to the rumour\nthat he is undertaking transfiguration\nclasses at Hogwarts in an attempt to\nspy on his rivals. It is believed that he\nhas chosen the form of a fly as his dis-guise. The evidence is stacking up...\nDavid Cameron has been overheard\ncomplaining about the fact that flies\nseem to be constantly circling above\nhis head, nothing to do with the stench\nof hipocrisy emanating from him of\ncourse...\nIn the recent expenses row it came\nout that Hazel Blears has been claiming for fly spray and fly swatters, when\nquestioned about the odd purchases,\nshe only commented that Gordon\nBrown needed them for his tendency\nto speak/breathe/exist. Coincidence?\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence involves Demi-God Barack\nObama. No doubt you will have heard\nthe furore over Obama vanquishing a\nfire-breathing dragon merely by looking at it with mild amusement. Well\nit seems that he has now developed\na new super-power to add to his ever\ngrowing arsenal. Yes, thats right, with\none swipe of his hand, he is able to\nrender even the most persistent of flies\nunconcious.\nBarry (yes, I can call him Barry)\nknocked a fly for six in an interview\nrecently, prompting speculation that\nhe is not actually human, but rather\na descendant of some kind of alien\nsuper-race.\nInterestingly \u2018not-so-flash\u2019 Gordon\nturned up at Downing Street the next\nday with two black eyes, a broken arm,\nmultiple rib fractures and what looked\nlike a prosthetic leg.\nThe buzz in London is that \u2018paper\nbag\u2019 Brown was attempting to gain\nan insight into what charisma is from\nhis counter-part across the swamp.\nMy advice, Prime-minister, is that you\nshould talk to Sir Peter Viggers about\nhiring out his duck island, take some\ntime off, reconnect with nature, learn\nhow to dodge like a real fly!\nOk, so, Gordon\u2019s a lost cause, let\u2019s\nface it, he\u2019s less popular than malaria.\nWhat we Brits need to concentrate on\nnow is trying to get Bazza to ditch the\nUS and come over here to swat all our\nflies, I don\u2019t know about you but they\u2019re\ngetting pretty damned annoying.\nIt seems that the Royals are doing\ntheir bit, inviting the Obama\u2019s over to\nthe palace for tea. Michelle Obama\neven went in for a hug with the Queen.\nObama was about to follow suit and\ngive Phillip a cuddle, luckily the D of\nE mistook the gesture for an excuse to\nshow of his new break-dancing moves.\nDon\u2019t do things like that Barack, don\u2019t\nyou know uselessness is contagious.\nSo, in conclusion, Obama has signed\na contract to be a judge on the X-factor whilst Gordon Brown has eloped\nwith Susan Boyle, current location\nunknown.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nI was a ginger\nbaby\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness\nBusiness Editor \u2013 Luke Dhanoa\nLuke Dhanoa\nBusiness Editor\nAs I was walking towards college, late\nfor my group meeting, a homeless\ngentleman asked me if I could spare\nsome change. And as I was about to\nexplain that I couldn\u2019t and shuffle on\nembarrassedly it occurred to me that\nthis pungent gentleman was in a better financial position than I was in. In\nfact he was in a much better financial\nposition than most of the students at\nImperial\u2026\nAn entities net worth (or equity) is\nthe difference between their assets\n(stuff they can sell in the long or short\nterm) and their liabilities (money you\nowe). This gives us ALE, the accounting equation:\nAssets \u2013 Liabilities = Equity\nFor the homeless man, who has no li-abilities, equity and assets are the same\nthing. So the Homeless man I saw had\na net worth equal to that of his clothes,\nhis money and his dog.\nFor your average final year student,\nthings are worse. Assets are essentially\nanything that exists in the students\nflat, and liabilites are anything that the\nstudent owes i.e. a huge student loan.\nA final year students net worth will\nonly be greater than zero if they have\nworked a job during their time at Uni\nthat has paid off most of their debt \u2013\ni.e. once every million years. Otherwise the greatest net value that a final\nyear student can have is zero \u2013 here\u2019s\nhow:\nCase 1: You took out a student\nloan.\nAll the stuff you bought with your student loan has been decreasing in value\nas you were using it (depreciation) and\nso even if you tried to sell it all you\nwould never get the full amount back.\nAdd to that all the money you spent on\nfood and drink (which didn\u2019t give you\nanything useful apart from prolonged\nlife) and it is clear that taking a student loan massively decreases your net\nworth over four years.\nCase 2: Mummy and Daddy paid\nfor everything.\nAnything bought by your parents (or\nwith their money) doesn\u2019t count as\nyours and so isn\u2019t an asset. In that case,\nyour best case scenario is to have absolutely no assets, no liabilities and so\nexactly zero net worth.\nSince most people are a combination of the two it is clear that the average leavers net worth cannot exceed\nzero. And since the homeless man has\nclothes, spare change and a dog, he is\nin a better financial position to you.\nBut chin up soon-to-be-graduates;\nthe homeless man is doing ridiculously\nwell these days. Consider the fate of\nthe major companies that fell befoul\nof subprime mortgages: most of these\ninstitutions are also worth less than the\nhomeless man. HBOS, Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan and Citibank all had\nnegative net value over the last twelve\nmonths, whereas our homeless man\nstayed consistently in the black with his\nrags, loose change and dog heavy port-folio. In fact that simple, diversified,\nsteady portfolio has seen the homeless\nman rise in value against GM, Chrysler, AIG and countless other firms.\nAnd not just by marginal amounts. Despite these companies having received\nbillions of dollars of government bail-outs, the homeless man still outvalued\nthese companies \u2013 with little or no\ngovernment help. Armed only with a\nsympathy-evoking canine and a stench\nthat charms pennies from purses, the\nhumble homeless man has managed to\noutperform some of the largest companies on earth, comprised of some of\nthe best minds of their generation.\nThe unsinkable\nvalue of the\nhomeless man\nfelix takes a look at how much poorer you\nare than homeless people\nHomeless men\nhave risen in\nvalue against\nGM, Chrysler,\nAIG, and\ncountless other\nfirms.\nAnd homeless women have done\neven better, because on top of the assets of homeless men, homeless women have (I assume) bras, too.\nFor investors, this is frustrating. Not\njust because of the performance gap\nbetween the homeless and the down\nstock market, but because there is no\nreal way for them to tap into the rock\nsolid dependability of homeless net values \u2013 though not from lack of trying.\nAfter the burst of the Internet bubble\nin 2001, bankers from Morgan Stanley\nfamously attempted to capitalise on the\n\u201cbankability\u201d of homeless people by\n\u201cbuying\u201d them.* But because nobody\nowned the homeless people in the\nfirst place the bankers just gave some\nmoney to the homeless people then\nclaimed them as a commodity. This\nthen boosted the homeless peoples as-sets, skyrocketing their value. Traders\nat the bank then decided to float these\nnew commodities on the stock market,\nand because their value had been sky-rocketing, investors bought up homeless people in droves, expecting their\nvalue trends to continue. However, at\naround lunchtime, many of the homeless bought some lunch with their new\nfound \u201cwealth\u201d which devastated their\nasset base and ruined their value in the\nmarket. The homeless person commodity then crashed spectacularly,\nproviding a lasting lesson about trying\nto buy homeless folk.\n*Not an actual historical event.\nThe last weekly news\nround-up, you may cry\nRich Enough\nThis week the number of people\nwealthy enough not to need to work\nreached a twelve year high of 2.3 mil-lion. The spike has been attributed\nto Gordon Brown\u2019s divinely-inspired\nstewardship of the world economy\nover this period. Increasingly many at\nhome and abroad have been able to\nretire early, confident that they have\nenough to stay wealthy for life.\nThe recent surge in the people\u2019s\nwealth has specifically been attributed\nto rising consumer confidence as the\nPM promised all voters a lick of brown\nsugar if re-elected.\nThe French are currently ahead with\n8.7% of their workforce not needing to\nwork, compared with the UK\u2019s 7.1%.\nThis has caused their trade unions to\nbecome increasingly jealous, meaning\nthat this week they had no specific reason not to protest.\nThe protestors have not realised so\nfar that if they do more working and\nless striking, they too could afford to\nretire early, because they are French.\n*May or may not be true.\nSuccess at the European\nElections\nThree weeks ago, felix was heavily criticised for its endorsement of the BNP.\nAngry students argued that since they\ncould never win a seat, we were only\ndamaging the chances of UKIP as our\nsecond choice. Today we can say we\ntold you so, and are delighted to report that the tireless crusaders of the\nreal interests of indigenous voters have\nwon two seats in the European Parliament. This has already been hailed by\nordinary people as a victory for seekers\nof the truth against the fascist oppression of the mainstream parties, who\nall conspire to keep their snouts in the\ntrough.\nOver the last week, however, leading\neconomists have also joined the chorus of enthusiasm arguing that their\neconomic policies offer the only true\nhope for the future of Britain. Led by\nbeloved leader Gordon Griffin-Brown,\nwhose calls for \u2018British Jobs for British People\u2019 have energised the party\nbase; the BNP has already vowed to\nstop all them immigrants, especially\nthem illigals, taking are jobs. This will\nrepresent a major set-back for the big\ncorporations but lead to improved living standards for indigenous British\npeople.\nEconomists are reminding us the\nbenefits don\u2019t stop there either. Nor do\nthey stop at their other economic policy to end the \u2018socially, economically\nand politically damaging monopolies\nnow being established by the supermarket giants.\u2019 Many of the BNP\u2019s\nsocial policies will also benefit the\neconomy. For instance, capital punishment for those \u2018caught red handed\u2019 will\ndeter and thus reduce crime, increasing public confidence. The optimistic\nsentiments about the prospects for\nBNP government following the next\ngeneral elections have gripped both of\nthe country\u2019s non-Jewish economists.\nMarkets saw their weekly peak on\nThursday, in anticipation of the news.\nSwine Flu\nJust when we thought swine flu was\nonce again confined to where it be-longs, a new wave of infections has\nspread beyond Mexico. It appears the\nnew world order elitist conspirators,\nwho oppose rising economic opti-mism, have reinstated the illness in order to prolong the state of hysteria that\nmakes the public ignore violations of\ntheir rights. Doctors are warning that\nthe disease remains extremely rare so\nvirus enthusiasts should still consider\nchoosing to be gay as their best bet. For\nthose who dislike illness, the advice remains unchanged: avoid anyone with a\nponcho or a lawnmower.\nBroadband Broadened\nThe Government has announced\nnew plans to create a \u2018Digital Britain\u2019\nwhere everyone has access to broadband internet. The plans are so good\nthat they cannot be trusted to existing\nproviders to offer interested clients, so\nall users of the Internet will have to pay\nfor it. The plans also include renewed\nefforts to fight piracy, which have been\nwelcomed by Mogadishu.\nRecently speaking at Imperial College, Nick Griffin commented that he didn\u2019t like the way that many of the\nstudents were squinting at him, whilst he tiraded against \u201cforrins, facists, pakis and all darkies in general\u201d\n\u201cThe French are\ncurrently ahead,\nwith 8.7% of\ntheir workforce\nnot needing to\nwork, compared\nwith the United\nKingdom\u2019s more\nmodest 7.1%\u201d\nSina Ataherian takes a brass-eyed look at this week\u2019s\ncomings and goings in the business and political world\nStay away from these people\n11\nFriday 19 June 2009 felix\n\n"

The 18 month\njourney that started in January 2008 is\nslowly but surely reaching the end, and I\nfeel that an editorial is appropriate.\nTo start off with, I would like to apologise for the length of this article, although I might\nget this wrong and it might end up being quite\nshort! But the fact of the matter is that there has\nbeen a lot on my mind, a lot of issues that have\nbeen burning away, which I have held back, mainly\nbecause I was unsure of the consequences it might\nhave on the paper. But then again, this is the last\nissue, what\u2019s the worst that can happen.\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning. The first term is\nalways full of optimism! Whether you are a first\nyear student, a returning student or a graduate\nwho has, for some bizarre reason, decided to stay\non for one more year to run the student newspa-per, all of you will feel optimistic. \u201cThis will be a\nnew year\u201d you say to yourself, \u201cthings will be different\u201d you reassure yourself. This optimism vanishes\nas quickly as it appeared, as soon as you step foot\non the campus, it is gone. I, for one, was optimistic\nthat our new sabbatical team will be different this\nyear, that they will show themselves as the voice of\nthe students and not just someone who is doing the\njob for their own gain! To me, this means showing\nyour face every now and then, and what better way\nto start than the Freshers\u2019 Week nights. Alas, they\ndid not go. The only ones to make it were myself,\nHannah Theodorou and Mark Chamberlain, the\nlast of which is the ICSMSU President and even\nhe managed to come to our Union to show that he\nwas there for the Medical students. If you want to\nget the students involved with the Union, then you\nhave to show your face, it\u2019s your bloody job! You\nare there to represent the students, how can you\nrepresent them if you do not know who they are?\nSo it wasn\u2019t the best of starts for them, but at least\nthey did make it up as the year went on, most of\nthem that is; Carter (DPFS) still manages to get in\nat 10:00 and leave at 16:00 without fail, also trying\nto find him during those hours is also a fun game!\nMy advice to next year\u2019s Sabbatical Officers, GO\nTO THE EVENTS AT FRESHERS\u2019 WEEK! Show\nyour face, wear brightly coloured shirts, wear your\nbadges, show them who you are and that you are\neasily accessible.\nAs for me, I was full of high hopes that this year\nwill be a good one, all I wanted to do, was expose\nthe problems that I thought existed within our Union. All credit to Tomo, he did an excellent job last\nyear but there were a few stories that I though he\nshould have ran but there was, of course, the fear\nthat we would be sued or that the paper would be\nimpounded. This fear was manifested from the\nStudents\u2019 Union, who came down to the office and\nbasically told us that we can\u2019t write that. The result\nof that was the birth of the gag and an interesting\nfront page that was blank but for a few words. We\nhad been censured, the cat had been gagged and\nfor every issue since then, our logo has had a gag\nover the mouth and we\u2019ve written \u2018news\u2019paper. I for\none was outraged at this, not the act of gagging the\ncat, but the act of being told what you can and cannot write. This all boils down to the Student-Staff\nprotocol which protects the Union staff from any\ncriticism in an open forum i.e. media! My argument\nhas always been that they are here to serve the students of the Union, therefore if they do not do their\njobs properly and it has an impact on the student\npopulation, then the students have a right to know.\nThis is essentially what annoyed me because the\nmembers of staff could continue to fail at their jobs\nand were getting away with providing a sub standard service. So I kept the gag, kept the design and\nwent in with the mentality that if something similar\ncame up again, then I would actually print it.\nJust in case you are interested, the stories that we\nwere told not to print included the old bar manager allegedly beating up a student at the bar when\ndrunk and that some money had gone missing from\nthe safe. Ooops, not sure if you guys were meant to\nknow that!\nSo for those of you who might have been wondering why the cat was gagged and all that, now you\nknow!\nBut what has been achieved since the cat had\nbeen gagged? Have we done enough to ungag the\ncat? I think we have, which is why there is a brand\nnew look. If you ever needed any proof, then here is\na list of some of the problems we have had this year:\n\u2022 Formal reprimands from the Union\n\u2022 College complaints over the Horoscopes\n(lol!)\n\u2022 Threats of lawsuits from Union Entertainment Department (threats, meaning\nthey thought about it and realised that\nthey can\u2019t win!)\n\u2022 Threats of lawsuits from Union Finance\nDepartment\n\u2022 Complaints from Union Catering Department (mega lolz!)\n\u2022 Threats of \u2018no-confidence\u2019 vote over\nHangman articles (again, thought about\ndoing it, then changed his mind!)\nThere are more, but the whole page would be\nfilled which would be pointless, but the message is\nclear; if you don\u2019t do your job properly, you will be\ncriticised. Oh, and before any of you say that I\u2019m\njust being a moaning git, I have been criticised for\nmy work. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, we have had\na few spelling fails this year; several of you have\ncome down to the office to point out the mistakes,\nyet none of you offered to help out, instead you\njust moaned how the spelling was atrocious and\nleft very quickly when I asked you if you wanted\nto help us out! Apart from the spelling mistakes,\nthere are those of you (all 13 that is) who complain\nthat I don\u2019t write enough about the matters that\nare affecting the students, like the latest change to\nparagraph seven, line two of Section B in the Imperial College Union Constitution. The reason I don\u2019t\nwrite about crap like that is that people couldn\u2019t\ncare less what needs to be put on official voting\nposters or arguing for two hours over wether or not\nwe should twin with a university in Gaza and then\nthere being an overwhelming rejection of the pa-per. People will not care about any of this because\nthe fact of the matter is that students are too apathetic over what the hacks do in the Union. Luckily\nfor me there are, however, people who are willing to\nwrite about that sort of stuff.\nLive! has developed a reputation for covering\nthe more serious (read boring) stories that go on\naround our campus. Saying it\u2019s boring is probably\na bit too harsh, but from experience, I find writing\nthem incredibly boring mainly because I couldn\u2019t\ncare less what they do, unless it actually affects the\nstudents directly; the ACC Scandal story springs to\nmind! At the same time, despite the fact that some\nof them might seem boring, some are incredibly\nuseful for the students to know, which is why there\nis a need to develop a relationship with Live!. We\nare very fortunate to have a wide range of media\noutlets at Imperial, and I see no reason why we\ncan\u2019t work together, after all we are all trying to get\nthe news to the students. So I would like to take this\nopportunity to thank Live! for making my life a little\nbit easier and not having to put me though writing those stories, yet at the same time, thank them\nfor providing the initial information from which to\nbuild a story on!\nCarrying on with the gratitude, I have to thank\nmy entire staff. Throughout the year we had up to\n40 people working on the paper (not many copy\neditors mind (p.s. Louise thanks for always being\nthere)) which is an amazing achievement. Without\nthem, we would have nothing but a four page paper\nfull of news, which would be incredibly boring. I\ncan not take any credit for the paper this year, the\nfact of the matter is that I am here to put all of the\npieces together, regardless of where the source is,\nso a massive thank you to everyone who was involved this year, you have all been amazing and I\nhope that you can carry on with the great work\nnext year. I would also like to make a special note\nof three particular members of my team, firstly my\nmanagerial team. Kadhim and Gilead have been\nabsolutely amazing this year, always there to give\nme a helping hand and go over the finer points of\nsome of the more problematic stories. I am indebted to their contribution this year. Finally, I would\nlike to create a little felix award for the best editor\nthis year and will hopefully get a tankard set up for\nthem. This year, there has been one person who has\ngone beyond anything that I have ever expected,\neven travelling thousands of miles to cover a story.\nThe Technology section has been an incredible\nsuccess and has included reports from as close as\nBirmingham and as far as Las Vegas (yes, he actually went to Las Vegas for a Technology fair!). He\nhas consistently provided content of a high quality\nand so this year\u2019s felix Editor Award goes to Richard\nLai! My final set of thanks go to the various people who have been helpful on a multitude of levels:\nAlex McKee for his technical support when things\nhave gone bad with the computers as well as helping out with the new digital archive (which will be\ndone in November, keep an eye out), same goes for\nPhil Power and finally, I\u2019d like to thank Alissa Ayling for helping us out with the felix Sports League\nwhich is proving to be extremely popular.\nA quick note about this week\u2019s issue, we have\ngiven it a bit of a light-hearted touch, everything\nhas been done in a much more relaxed manner and\nwe hope you enjoy it (p.s. seeing as there is little\nsport going on now, the sport section has been very\ncreative with its content this week, as has most of\nthe paper!).\nThat\u2019s about it from me; my final note goes to next\nyear\u2019s editor Dan Wan. I wish him the best of luck\nnext year and would like to offer him this advice; do\nnot be scared to print what is necessary. If someone\nin the Union isn\u2019t doing their job and it is affecting\nthe student body, let the students know. The same\ncan be said for the members of the College, probably one area I didn\u2019t focus on enough this year! I\nwould also strongly recommend that you not only\ncontinue building a relationship between felix and\nLive!, but with all of the media sources at Imperial\nso that our media output is a string voice to the\nstudents.\nThe Cat is free, let\u2019s keep it that way!\nNothing more left for me to say apart from it\u2019s\ngood-bye from me, and hello from him...\nI\nsometimes need to pinch myself to\nrealise I have been at university for\ntwo years. As I muse over these last\ncouple of years, I try to think what\nI\u2019ve actually done with my time.\nCollege data files and records will tell of\na below -average student bumbling his\nthrough a Biology degree.\nBetween the heady hours of lym-phocytes, nematodes and actinomyosin\nmechanisms, I\u2019ve been doing what I\u2019ve\nbeen most proud to have done at Imperial. It is exactly what I\u2019m doing now; writing for felix.\nI have written under two great Editors, Tom Roberts and Jovan Nedic. Both\nhave had a firm grip on the scruff of Felix\nthe cat\u2019s neck. Their commitment to the\nnewspaper has been outstanding, and has\nbeen evidenced every Friday when a new\nissue arrives around College.\nTom \u201cthe Bob\u201d Roberts will be leaving\nImperial this year after somehow scraping out a Physics degree from bottomless pit that is his abilities. He shall leave\nin the highest regard, not only amongst\nfelix writers and readers, but the nation\u2019s\nmedia industry. Under his Editorship last\nyear, felix won Guardian Student Newspaper of the Year. Alongside that, the\nGuardian awarded him Student Journalist of the Year. He\u2019s also the brains and\nfounder of Imperial\u2019s own gaming magazine Another Castle, and hence I\u2019m sure\nhe needs no luck in finding employment\nafter he graduates. The prick.\nThis year, Jovan has arguably had a\nharder task as Editor. Keeping up with expectations and reputations of an award-winning newspaper is not an easy feat.\nHe could have easily suffered from \u2018second-time syndrome\u2019, but instead has kept\na steady ship throughout this academic\nyear. He has ruthlessly lifted the lid on the\nmany aspects of College and the Union\nthat needed bringing to account, and that\nis the true-calling of a student journalist.\nThrough these two people though, I\nhave learnt many a lesson. But on behalf\nof the entire felix team, I sincerely thank\nboth Tomo and Jovan for the hours they\nhave spent in the dungeon that is the felix\noffice as Editor-in-Chiefs. Felix would be\na fraction of its current form in terms of\nreputation, quality and readership without these two Editors.\nNext year however, it will be my lap that\nFelix the cat will reside on. Depending on\nmy exam results, you shall see a felix next\nyear which will be refreshed and purring,\nawaiting the new Freshers\u2019 arrival and\nbeyond.\nIamnotmistakeninthinkingbeingEditor will be an easy task. It is an immensely difficult one. It will be a spirit-sapping\nchallenge to get to the printing deadline\nwith a newspaper I will be satisfied with.\nOne good enough to release to the masses\nof Imperial each week. However, my two\nyears as Fashion and now News Editor\nhave taught me I\u2019ll enjoy the many rushes\nand stresses that it will bring me.\nThe very being of felix is not possible\nwithout the contributions of so many\npeople each week though. The receiving,\nreading and discussing of people\u2019s articles\nis one of the most fascinating aspects of\nediting for felix. I love seeing the diversity\nof activity and opinion that comes from\nthe people at Imperial. Hence, I hope\ncontributions will continue into next\nyear because I\u2019m definitely proud to publish them.\nSo this is my early call-out to everyone\nthat wants to contribute. I\u2019ve been recently been made aware that a lot of people\nwant to write for felix, but either don\u2019t\nknow how, or feel they don\u2019t know what\nto write about. Just write. Write to argue\na case, to fight a cause, to show off, what-ever. You can definitely tell when something is written with enthusiasm and\nthat\u2019s pretty much what most writing is\nbased on. felix rarely, if ever, reject a con-tribution. I\u2019d only reject a contribution if\nit\u2019s blatantly offensive. Even if you think\nyou can\u2019t write, you probably can. Even if\nyou genuinely can\u2019t, well, that\u2019s what the\nEditors are there for!\nFelix doesn\u2019t particularly look for pieces\nthat are of the highest journalistic or narrative quality. It looks for writing that is of\ninterest to you, the writer, and inevitably\nothers. A student newspaper should represent the interests across a student body;\nand you\u2019re the only ones that can provide\nthat. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a great writer by\nany means. I just started writing because\nI enjoyed it.\nWe\u2019re all scientists, engineers and med-ics. We\u2019re not writers. In a way, this works\nto our advantage. Everything we write\nis contributing nothing towards our de-grees, but a lot towards being part of College life. I see felix as weekly snapshot of\nlife at Imperial College.\nIf you haven\u2019t written for felix before,\nI hope next year will seem like an open\nopportunity. Don\u2019t wait for editors to\nask. Do the writing first, and then email\nit over to felix@imperial.ac.uk. It\u2019s actually that simple. As I said, it\u2019s not like\nwe\u2019ll send it back with a giant metaphorical red \u201cREJECT\u201d rubber stamp on it. I\u2019ll\nthen direct it to the appropriate section\nof the newspaper, and we\u2019ll tart it up for\npublication.\nFor those that are really serious about\ngetting involved with felix, there\u2019s going\nto be various editorial roles vacant come\nOctober. With the inevitable cut in humanities options next year, you might\nneed something else on your degree to\njustify your (my) 2:2 honours. Being able\nto edit and layout a newspaper is a useful\naddition to your ever-expanding skillset,\nand hey, you might even start to enjoy it.\nIt\u2019s all fun and games down in the of-fice, which is located downstairs in Beit\u2019s\nWest Wing. Just head towards the lawn\nin Beit Quad, and just before you get to\nit, turn left. We\u2019re through the doors and\ndown the stairs. There\u2019s loads of cool\npeople to meet and talk with, and the\ndoor is quite literally always open, so just\nwaltz in at any hour of the day (and half\nthe time, night). Failing that, I\u2019ll always\nbe there, undoubtedly with my eerie yet\nwelcoming Cheshire cat grin.\nSo with another year over, here comes\nthe three months of anything that isn\u2019t\nImperial College. Unlike most though, I\ndon\u2019t get a real summer, as I\u2019ve got to start\non this year\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Handbook. You\nknow, that thing you got in the post as a\nbright-eyed Sixth Former but never really\nread. Oh yeh, that thing.\nL\nast Sunday, I went on an\nadventure.Now, when I say\nadventure, I may be exaggerating just a tad. I had\nwoken up with the desire\nto see Hampstead Heath, or rather, to\nsee the view from Hampstead Heath\nwhich I\u2019ve heard is quite spectacu-lar. My adventure might not have the\nscope of Middle Earth, or the religious\novertones of Narnia, but, I realised, it\nstill made a damn good allegory.\nHere we are, coming to the end of\nanother year at Imperial. For me, my\nfirst year is coming to a close. Frankly,\nI can\u2019t believe it. It seems like only yesterday that I moved into halls, fresh-eyed, bushy-tailed and with only a mediocre recipe for beans on toast under\nmy belt. Now, I\u2019m a little older, (hope-fully) a little wiser and a little more\ncompetent in the kitchen. Exactly how\ndid I get here?\nI began my journey to Hampstead\nHeath on the cultured pavements of\nExhibition Road. I mingled with tourists as I passed by the erudite edifices\nof the Natural History Museum and\nthe V&A. I knew to get there, indeed,\nanywhere in London, I\u2019d need to take\nthe Tube. The Underground has always seemed a bit alien to me. You descend into the darkness, impenetrably\ndeep, to be whisked off by iron horses to a far-flung destination at high\nspeed, guided by the ethereal music of\nthe buskers. The escalators in Leicester Square Station are just another\nrabbit-hole.\nIt reminds me of my first days here.\nTo an outsider like me, London was\na big and scary place. There were so\nmany places to go, so many places to\nbe. It sometimes seemed that London\nwas merely a collection of landmarks\nconnected only by tour-bus routes.\nAnd Imperial itself, with its myriads\nof students. Never mind the architec-ture, it was easy enough to get lost in\nthe people.\nFirst the Piccadilly and then the\nNorthern Line took me to my destina-tion. I emerge somewhere in Camden\nand am greeted by very unfamiliar sur-roundings. I know I\u2019m still in London.\nI\u2019m always in London. With my A-Z\nmap in hand, I stride forwards boldly\ninto the unknown. In his travels, the\nhero journeys to unknown lands, inhabited by strange peoples.\nBy the second term, I had settled in\nto some extent. I had acquainted myself with my colleagues and the relevant stops on the Underground. I was\nbeginning to feel comfortable, like I\nknew where I was in the big city. But\nLondon and Imperial still had more to\noffer and to throw at me. I\u2019ve been\nstripped to waist and shown where\nmy Xiphisternum is; I\u2019ve been offered\nCharlie five steps after a bunch of\nroses; I\u2019ve asked City Bankers for money at five in the morning. I am indeed a\nstranger in a strange, strange land.\nEventually, I reached Hampstead\nHeath. But there\u2019s more to go. Elevated\nas it is, I need to go higher, to the top\nof Parliament Hill to take in the capi-tal. I soldier on up the hill as families\nand friends enjoy the summer on either side of me. The climb isn\u2019t particularly steep but, combined with the\nheat raining down on me, is enough to\nbring sweat to my brow. Almost there,\nI mutter, almost there. The climax\nof the tale, wherein the hero battles\ncountless foes, slays the dragons and\nwins fair ladies\u2019 hearts. The darkest\nhour is just before the dawn \u2013 even if,\nscientifically, it\u2019s actually in the middle\nof the night.\nThe third term lay in the shadow of\nthe valley of death \u2013 that is, exams. I\nwatched as cool, well-adjusted students (Well, by Imperial\u2019s standards)\ndissolve into neurotic bags of paranoia\nand insomnia. In lectures, part of my\nmind wondered, would this be on the\nexam? Was there any point in learning this? As May gave way to June, life\nbecame an ever-more delicate balance\nbetween learning the current work\nand revising the work of the previous\ntwo terms, and sleep was entirely op-tional. It culminated in my first year\u2019s\nexams, five days of diarrhoea, mental\nand otherwise.\nBack on the Heath, I finally made it to\nthe top. Like Orpheus, I had to piously\nresist the temptation to glance back at\nwhere I had come. Only when I was at\nthe summit did I turn to gaze. The view\nwas everything I had been told it was.\nFrom the City in the east to Crystal\nPalace in the west, via St Paul\u2019s and the\nLondon Eye, I could \u201csee the world in\na grain of sand.\u201d With my head down,\nhurrying across to the Charing Cross\ncampus for another Anatomy lecture,\nLondon just seems like a ubiquitous,\namorphous mass of bricks and people.\nBut up on the Heath, you get to see the\ncreature whose arteries you walk down\nevery day. It\u2019s almost soulful.\nIn a book, this would be the end of\nstory, the journey completed. But, clich\u00e9 as it may be, this is far from the\nend. Imperial and I have many more\nyears together yet. And I can\u2019t wait!\nSo yes, for most of us now, the exams\nare over. Woohoo! To those still burning the midnight oil in the library, good\nluck. To everyone else, have a great\nsummer and (with any luck) I\u2019ll see you\nagain in October!\nRhys Davies goes on an end-of-year adventure\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t\nwritten for\nfelix before,\nI hope next\nyear will seem\nlike an open\nopportunity\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been\nstripped to waist\nand shown\nwhere my\nXiphisternum is\u201d\nEditor in prowling, Dan Wan, needs you\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nReaching the end of\nthe road\n\n"

Like a special\nman take another bite- who\u2019s the hunter? Who\u2019s\nthe game? This time you are both, if you survive\nyou will be the most prestigious warrior that has\never lived. Grab it with both hands.\nVirgo\nBy finishing your\nexams you reach\ntotal boredom. Do\nnot despair and take\nyour anger out on\nyour dearest. You\nhave nowhere to run, and nowhere to go. So do\nsomething with your life, try train spotting.

In the future weeks you will\nlook back with pride.\nPisces\nLook at your life,\nthings it has been a\nbad year and this week\nwill not get better\nuntil you light up. It\u2019s\nnow of never- you\nain\u2019t going to live forever. You have to initatiate\nit yourself- as if you have a choice.

All hope\nlooks like it is lost,\nbut you must rely\non love to bring you\nthough. Confusion\nmay set in, but close the door do not let the evil\ndiffuse into your thoughts.

You will feel it, you will feel it.\nHoroscopes, all your trials for the forthcoming week\nHe made a grown man cry, but fear not- Horoscopes have been started up again. Can they compete?\nCapricorn\nLooking in her eyes\nyou see a paradise, this\nworld that you found is\ntoo good to be true. Put\nyour arms around her,\nand don\u2019t ever let go.\nPut your hands in her hand, don\u2019t ever look back.\nEven if the world begins to fall down around you,\nforget it. You can build this thing together. Nothing will stop you now. You were made for each\nother and the love you spawn is beautiful.

Well\nthis means one thing. This\nis my last Coffee Break section ever! Don\u2019t cry dear\nfans, I am not leaving felix, just moving\non to do other things. Things like pho-toshopping random pictures, perhaps\ndoing some news stories and comment.\nWho knows right now, just pick up an\nissue next year and have a gander. The\nbig question is who will replace me?\nWell isn\u2019t it obvious? The one and only\nCharles Murdoch. Throughout the year\nhe has been selectively and secretly\ntrained in the art of procrastination,\nand now team felix believes he is ready.\nReady for the big time baby, Oh yeah!\nSo what have we learned this year? I\nthink we have proven the resurrected\nFUCWIT league has been a hugh suc-cess, with numerous entries pouring\nin each week. With a fierce battle between Team Shotgun and Mochten sie\nmein manshaft? all year, Team Shotgun won by the smallest of margins.\nOnly 5 Points separate the two impressive teams. While Giramondo claims\ntop place in the individual league table.\nWell done to everyone who participated and let hope the enthusiasm continues to next year.\nWe also learned that it can be funny\nto make up lies and rumours about\nthe current and elected Sabbaticals.\nLet me take a moment to remind you\nagain, that this was a joke, and give our\napologies to all offended parties.\nLastly I would like to comment on\nthe massive success that is the ding-bats. Something I thought wouldn\u2019t\ntake off, but has proven me wrong. A\nfun little puzzle to do each week, that\nmakes you think. In fact the idea is in-genious. I personally am liking the new\nand improved graphical dingbats that\ncan be viewed bellow.\nThis year we have also had some\nfun. There was the great Twitter race,\nthe ethnic top trumps and the \u201cStuff\nIC students Like\u201d Lets not forget the\ngreatness that was relentless. We also\nhad a Photoshop competition, which\nprovided many amusing moments. In\nparticular the one with the characters\nfrom Aquateen Hungerforce come to\nmind. I have had fun providing entertainment to you readers his year, and\nwill miss the unadulterate fun that is\nsynonymous with the job, but all great\nthings come to an end, only to be started up again next academic season.\nI hope you have had a good year, and\nfor those that haven\u2019t finished exams,\nunlucky, but at least there will be some\npuzzles for you to do.

    "content": "news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews\n6 felix Friday 19 June 2009\nI\nt all seemed rather impres-sive: swipe cards, RFID, strange\nlooking keyholes and a security\nguard on-hand to testify about\nthe impressive security of the\nSouthside \u2018complex\u2019. At least that is\nhow it was presented during freshers\nweek. We were told that so long as our\ndoors were shut correctly that it was\nalmost impossible to break in and that\nall burglaries thus-far had been as a\nresult of students not shutting their\ndoors.\nSo that\u2019s exactly what the 350+ fresh-ers living in Southside did \u2014 in the belief that they were secure. Of course,\nit was not long before the more astute\nstudents realised that it was theoretically possible to open the doors using\na credit card. A Hollywood favourite\nshimming is a lock-bypass technique\nwhereby a flexible object \u2014 such as\na credit card \u2014 is slid in between the\ndoor and the frame and used to manipulate the latch. For this to work two\nconditions must be satisfied.\nFirstly, the door can not be dead bolt-ed, which is when bolt is connected directly to the locking cylinder. Thus the\nonly way to move the bolt is to rotate\nthe cylinder \u2014 which requires the key\nto be inserted. Although most house\nlocks are dead bolted those in Southside are not. This is as a result of the\nswipe card access system. (In order for\nthe doors to automatically lock when\nclosed the latch must always be free to\nmove.)\nSecondly, there must be sufficient\nspace between the frame and the door\nto allow a shim to be inserted. Although this should never be the case\nthere is no substitute for shoddy work-manship, as I will get into later.\nWhile you occasionally heard stories\nof someone in another Southside hall\nmanaging to get into their rooms using a credit card, few took them seri-ously, assuming that his/her door had\nshifted significantly to make it possi-ble. Until, that is, I tried it myself.\nAfter five minutes R&D with a fellow Physicist and an empty coke can\nwe had created our own shim. Being\nmade of aluminium it was a good deal\nthinner than a credit card and much\nbetter shaped. Using this we were able\nto open (with permission, naturally)\nover 70% of the doors we tried. Usually the entire process, from inserting\nthe shim to opening the door takes a\nsmidgeon under five seconds. Five\nseconds!\nSome of the doors are so bad that it\nis possible to open them by wedging\nan unfolded Tropicana carton in between the door and the frame and jiggling it around for a few seconds.\nBut, there\u2019s more. Each person in\nSouthside has a lockable drawer in\nIs your room in Southside safe?\nFreddie Witherden, resident of Southside, finds out how easy it\nis to break into the rooms and secure lockers\ntheir wardrobe. Perfect for valuables,\nsuch as cash, passports &c \u2014 or so we\nthought. Sadly the locks used on these\ndrawers are some of the poorest I have\ncome across in my two years of pick-ing. In lock-jargon terms: the locks\nhave an open rectangular keyhole with\na single row of three pins; none of\nwhich are security pins.\nWith a set of lock picks it is possible\nto open any of the drawers in Southside in under ten seconds, on average.\nHowever to add insult to injury, so to\nspeak, it is possible to open them in a\nsimilar amount of time using nothing\nbut a screwdriver and metal paper clip.\nAlthough those with any experience\npicking locks normally frown at the\nuse of paper clips (on most real locks\nthey are useless) the locks in Southside\nare so exceptionally poor that they are\nactually a valid option.\nIt is a somewhat disturbing thought\nthat a would-be burglar needs nothing more than a folded up coke can,\na screwdriver and a paper clip to be\nable to successfully mount an crime\nspree on most of the rooms in Southside. Moreover with tailgating into the\nbuilding as easy as it is this is something of a real concern for both myself\nand others who I have talked to on the\nissue.\nSo, what can be done about all of\nthis? Well, in the short term, very lit-tle. Thankfully with only one week left\nand very few (if any) robberies this\nyear us Southside residents can consider ourselves lucky.\nIn the long term security and residency will need to look at each and\nevery door in Southside and see if it\nis vulnerable to shimming. If this is\nthe case then the door will need to be\nreseated such that it is impossible to\ninsert a shim.\nIf nothing is done then I would not\nbe surprised if by the time next years\nlambs come to the slaughter (I mean,\nerr, freshers) that over 85% of the\ndoors could be susceptible to shim-ming. This is because Southside appears to be either (depending on who\nyou talk to) still settling or subsiding;\nresulting in ever larger gaps between\ndoors and frames.\nAs for the lockable drawers, my personal recommendation is that locks\non each drawer are changed to something more substantial. It is somewhat\nironic that the locks on the doors \u2014\nwhich are seldom used \u2014 are some of\nthe best in the industry (jargon: MulT-lock Classic dimple locks featuring\npins-in-pins, layman: reasonably difficult to pick) while the drawer locks are\nsome of the worst available.\nFinally, what does this mean for the\nnew Eastside halls? While I have not\nvisited Eastside yet I would not be\nsurprised if it uses the same set-up as\nSouthside and so is also likely to be\nequally vulnerable.\nAll you need is a metallic can to open the doors...\nimperialcollegeunion.org/ball\nSummer Ball 2009\nImperial College London\nSaturday 20 June\nCABARET STAGE\n(THE DOCTOR & THE PENCIL)\nTHE GLOBE GIRLS JAZZ BIG BAND\nNOEL FIELDING & DAVE BROWN\n\u00a340\nENTERTAINMENTS\nLIVE ARENA\nATHLETE\nROSIE & THE GOLDBUG TAPE THE RADIO\nBATTLE OF THE BANDS WINNER\nJEFF AUTOMATIC CLUB NME\nALSO...\nDANCE VENUE\nPENDULUM\nCHASE & STATUS FEAT MC RAGE\n(EL HORNET DJ SET) FEAT MC JAKES\nINTERLOPE (LIVE)\nKILLA KELA SCRATCH PERVERTS\n\u2022 FUN FAIR\n\u2022 BIG WHEEL\n\u2022 DODGEMS\n\u2022 AMAZING LIGHT SHOWS\n\u2022 3D PROJECTIONS\n\u2022 FOOD VANS\n\u2022 WANDERING ACTS\n\u2022 FIREWORKS\n\u2022 SURVIVORS\u2019 PHOTO\n\u2022 TONI & GUY HAIR SALON\n\u2022 PROFESSIONAL\nPHOTOGRAPHER\n1 DAY TO GO!\nENTERTAINMENTS TICKETS STILL ONLINE\n& WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE DOOR\nREMEMBER YOU NEED TO BRING YOUR\nCID CARD TO GET IN!\n\n"

They are life\u2019s\nlittle insurance slips, givDon\u2019t give me those eyes... it\nwon\u2019t work! I love my wife!\nIt\u2019s ok, you don\u2019t technically have\nto stay at work after four o\u2019clock\nAlright, fine it\u2019s not very big, you\ndon\u2019t have to go on about it\nWords cannot describe how much\nI just vomited in my own mouth\nJenny Morgan\nCause of death: Defenestrated\n(thrown out of a window... fools)\nT\nhere are days when Jennifer Morgan was in the\noffice. I swear this isn\u2019t a\njoke. I\u2019ve seen her there\ntwice. Personally. These\nweren\u2019t even rumours.\nJenny was quite easily our favourite\nSabbatical Officer. Not because she is a\npirate, but mostly because she is NOT\na ninja. I\u2019ve hear people try to come up\nwith crazy lies about nun-chucks outside her office. This is blatant libel \u2013the\nkind that this fine newspaper tends to\nwant to print on a regular basis but the\nlate Johvan Nedick was too much of\na girl to ever publish. By the way, Jovan actually misspelt his own name in\nsome of the earlier issues.\nJenny did not take this lightly...\nHer achievements were manifold,\nnot only did she make the arduous\njourney to her office twice (see above)\nshe was almost never, ever grumpy.\nOr disinterested, or blatantly bored\nand rude to people\u2019s faces on important student issues. Hangman is never\nsarcastic.\nIt appears, that she was right to avoid\nthe offices. Even though she spent so\nmuch of her time, getting along with\nthe other sabbs and staff (Hangman\nis never sarcastic), they threw pushed\nasked her politely to go out the win-dow. It was a gorgeous, splattering,\nsexy mess on the floor. Awww splaff!\nChristian Carter\nCause of death: Murdered by\ngirlfriend in his sleep\nW\nhen you think of\nChristian Carter,\nyou might remember him as the\nDPFS candidate\nthat should have been beaten by RON.\nIf you are not hack however, you\u2019ll\ndefinitely know him from his recurring\nrole as Beaker in the great TV show\nthat was The Muppets. Christian grew\nup facing vast criticisms and amidst\nmany disconcerting news stories of\nmidget orgies and puppet torture. His\nrise to fame was stellar, but now but\nhis career at Imperial cemented him as\na dying star in a boring galaxy in the\nmiddle of a boring part of a boring uni-verse. The perfect demise.\nDuring his Office term, wannabe\nponce and Tory Christian came into\ncontact with a succubus by the name\nof Fiona O\u2019Connell. Every night after\nbizarre and criminal sex sessions with\nher, Carter would fall asleep almost\nimmediately. When deep in slum-ber, Fiona would slowly suck his soul\nand a little bit of his life with it at the\nsame time. Weeks and weeks of this\nnightly ritual finally took their toll\non a drained Deputy President and\nhe finally succumbed to an untimely\ndeath. The Police seems to think Miss\nO\u2019Connell is on the run. A medium has\ntold Hangman she will win the election\nto become ICU\u2019s new DPFS next year.\nHannah Theodorou\nCause of death: Drowned in a sea\nof urine\nA\nfact that many people\nare unaware of is that\nHannah was born in the\ntiny island of Rhodes in\nGreece. She spent her\nchildhood eating olives and drinking\nolive oil. Her love for oil based products was never questioned by her\npeers. As a child, she was never the\nprettiest kid and as a result fled to Romania where she spent much of her\nyouth working in a soap factory. When\nbreasts started developing in what was\na huge project for her, the boys started\npaying attention to the girl in pigtails.\nHannah revelled in this newfound attention and worked as a hostess in a\nbrothel for many years before embarking on a fulfilling career to become a\nurologist at Imperial College.\nHannah was excited when an invitation was put through the mailbox of\nher Brixton estate. It was an invitation\nto an orgy of \u201curinary\u201d proportions.\nAs she dressed in her \u201cfuck me\npumps\u201d so aptly described by Imperial\nGirl, she had no idea what lay in store\nfor her.\nIn fact the invitation was from the\nSci Fi society. They awaited with full\nbladders and pounced with gallons of\nwarm flowing goodness. Alright...\nAs a medic, Hannah wished that she\nhad told them to drink less carbonated\nbeverages... it was a smelly end, sozlolz.\nLily Topham\nCause of death: Choked to death,\nby a silhouetted figure\nT\nopham. It sounds like the\nTop of the Ham. Get it?\nIt\u2019s funny because I did a\nlittle pun involving Lily\u2019s\nname. The reason I did\nthis is because there is absolutely nothing to say about Lily. She is known as a\ncomplete non-entity.\nOk fine, I\u2019ll write something about\nher.\nLily has been a fine Deputy President of Clubs (cockheads) and Societies (syphilis). Under her boring rule,\nclub discipline has increased to never\nbefore seen levels of moral rectitude.\nThe Football Club now almost never\ntrashes pubs in Hammersmith.\nNow they spend their days over at\nLily\u2019s dark basement, putting on plays\nfor her, so that she knows what she\nputs the rest of Imperial through when\nshe takes the stage, or the director\u2019s\nchair, or the 430 from Putney Bridge.\nShe loves that bus, the bus doesn\u2019t love\nher back, nobody loves her back. Nobody who\u2019s ever met her, knows what\nlove is anymore...\nShe was strangled in her bed, one\nevening. We have no idea how this\nhappened, we totally did not murder\nLily Topham, I promise. If we knew\nwhat love was, we\u2019d love her... right...\nA post-mortem found marbles in her\nva-jay-jay (best euphemism ever). We\nlove you Oprah, not you Lily.\nMark Chamberlain\nCause of death: Killed by other\nSabbs envious of his high salary\nS\name old, same old for Mark\nChamberlain, the not-so-beloved Medic President.\nKnown to most of his frene-mies as Chumberbum, Mark\nwas a great fan of BDSM (Bondage,\nDomination and Sadomasochism for\nthose not in his circle of perverted sex\nfiend friends).\nNever to be seen in his office, it is\nlikely that he was at the strip club\nputting fivers in the G-strings of\ntanned and oiled barely legal boys. His\nlife was one of pure debauchery, that\nhis overly inflated Sabbatical salary\nprovided him with.\nChumberbum\u2019s hobbies were diverse\nand they included purchasing stock-ings, wearing stockings, purchasing\nbutt plus, and using butt plugs. These\nseem to be along the same lines but for\na lover of all things dirty, Mark can see\nmuch distinction in all of them.\nWhile Mark was performing an act\nof auto-erotic self asphyxiation one\nfine day last week, he was surprised\nby his fellow Sabbatical Officers who\ntortured him by putting needles in his\neyeballs and playing football with his\nnewly severed head. As the old saying\ngoes, \u201cIf kinky sex shit doesn\u2019t kill you,\nImperial College Good-for-Nothing\nOfficers will\u201d. Okay fine, I made that\none up, but it is completely befitting of\nthe situation.\nThey were so close to completing their terms as Sabbaticals but unfortunately fate intervened and they have\nall come to sticky ends. Although, they wouldn\u2019t have survived long in real world anyway so... meh...\ning you hope that if you really needed\nthe money, you could march into\nAmerican Apparel, flourish your receipt and demand you statutory rights\nas a consumer (which would not be\naffected). That\u2019s why of course, your\nwallet bulges with old receipts for that\nscone you bought 3 years ago.\nMore often than not, we don\u2019t return\nour purchases, especially not for food\n(apart maybe when you buy milk that\u2019s\noff from Tescos but then still, that Tescos down the road is rather far... just\nhold your nose...). So then why, in the\nname of Beelzebub\u2019s kid sister, does the\nLibrary Cafe insist on giving a receipt\nfor every measly bottle of water!\nIs it because they think that we buy\nour food on some ethereal expenses account and that we\u2019ll need proof of our\nspendings? In any case, it\u2019s killing the\ntrees and the lemurs and stuff and nobody wants one. Nobody. Now stop it!\nBefore the year ends, and I go have\nan awesome summer while you have a\nshit one, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for all the\nthings I\u2019ve said... to your mum... when\nI\u2019m slamming her in your bed...

However if reports are to be believed, Newcastle\nhave agreed to fund a proportion of\nthe players wage in exchange for the\nformer Imperial humanities department moving to St. James\u2019s Park.\nCaretaker manager Alan Shearer\nhas expressed his interest in installing\na degree of culture amongst his squad.\nCurrent players have also shown support for the swap with Joey Barton excited about increasing his already encyclopaedic knowledge on the History\nsession. The wushu club introduced\nthe kung fu style of drunken box-ing. Under the superb tutoring of the\nwushu instructor we learned a routine of movements: pretending to be\ndrunk, stumbling around and falling\nflat on our faces while actually throwing punches and applying joint locks\ndisguised as taking another drink.\nNow already bruised and slightly\nexhausted but at the same time very\nexcited and happy we tapped our last\nenergy resources for Thai kickbox-ing, the final session of the day. The\nThai kickboxing club spared no effort and moved an immense amount\nof equipment down from Paddington\nwhere they normally practice. They\nprovided boxing gloves and shin pads\nfor everyone as well as pads for dem-onstrations. The next hour was spent\npracticing the characteristic Thai\nkickboxing techniques: kicks with\nshins and knees to the upper body\nand to the legs, and the close combat\nfight called clinching. By this time all\nclubs were fully mingled. Everybody\nwas exchanging ideas and tips, and\ndiscovering or applying techniques\nfrom their own sport in the other\ndisciplines.\nCompletely exhausted, bruised and\nblistered but with huge smiles on our\nfaces we left Ethos at 5pm for the Union bar where we spent the evening\nre-hydrating, relaxing and discussing\nour impressions of the day.

At the beginning of the year a bunch of our students had to live at a Thames Valley University Hall called Paragon.\nBit of a balls-up by accommodation but they eventually got moved\ninto Imperial Halls.\nThen there was that Palestinian\nstudent Zohair Abu-Shaban. He\nhad a scholarship to do Electrical Engineering at Imperial but he\ncouldn\u2019t leave Gaza. Eventually he\nescaped by boat and he\u2019s going to\nstart his course next year.\nThat\u2019s you just wanting to show off your news pieces\nKadhim. Both matters got resolved though, which\nwas good. A few of the freshers came to Southwell\nand they seem to have settled in nicely.\nOne of the best stories was when the Canoe Club\nsaved a man\u2019s life. Apparently he was having a bit\nof trouble in the water and they dived straight in.\nLegends.\nUnlike the Football Club, they made the headlines\nfor smashing up pubs in Hammersmith. People were\nnot best pleased. They ended up doing community\nservice.\nThen we had some really good news in November. We won Best Newspaper at the Guardian\nStudent Media Awards and last year\u2019s Editor\nTom Roberts won Journalist of the Year. Angry\nGeek and iScience both came runners up for\nBest Columnist and Best Magazine.\nThat was the first term, and while we were\nrelaxing over Christmas a couple of Geology\nstudents were busying getting fined by the\nChinese government for \u201cillegal map-making\u201d.\nThey were doing geological surveys as part of\ntheir course and the College agreed to pay the\nfine for them. Win!\nWe finally got to meet the new Rector in he\nSpring term. He was a bit of dude wasn\u2019t he?\nSure he said some pretty controversial stuff\nabout increasing fees and privatising universities to be like Yale and Harvard but still, bit of\na dude.\nThere were some more problems with football teams, even after the\nHammersmith incidents. The Gaelic Football team were a bit aggressive\nin the Union and chanting stuff about the IRA\u2026 definitely not cool.\nIt seems like violence was a bit of an \u2018in-thing\u2019 this year. There was a bust\nup at House of Coffees and one guy got hit over the head with a chair.\nThe worst is that there was a girl in crutches who got showered with\nbroken glass and had a cut on her forehead.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all bad news with sport. Varsity was a great success as\nusual, even if the Medics won the JPR Williams Cup again.\nThat\u2019s not funny\nSo what happend\nwith the medic\u2019s this\nyear Dina?\nWell, a surgeon at St\nMary\u2019s took out the wrong\norgan. She was meant\nto have a gynaecological\noperation but got her gall\nbladder removed instead.\nThen a consultant tried to\npoison his pregnant girlfriend in order to make her\nmiscarry. It goes without\nsaying that he\u2019s been disqualified from working at\nSt Mary\u2019s.\nOn a more lighthearted\nnote, a Medic student went\non the ITV show \u201cThe Colour of Money\u201d. Almost\nnobody watches it and\nunfortunately the student,\nSumera Shaheny went\nhome empty handed.\nTo end a year of mishaps\nfor Medicine at Imperial,\nit turned out in May that a\ntaxi-firm had conned Imperial College NHS Trust out\nof \u00a3280,000. Employees at\nLewis Day Courier made\nup fake journeys and then\ninvoiced the Trust for them.\nSo basically Medics are\nbetter than IC at rugby but\nshit at everything else?\nPerfect\nIn the final term it seems like things kept getting shutdown. On top of\nthe Humanities cuts, the library in the Aero Department was closed\ndown. People really got annoyed about the Humanities cuts, there was\na huge protest (well around 100 people), a petition with over 1,000 signatures and a council motion opposing the cuts but it\u2019s not clear if the\nCollege are actually going to pay attention.\nAlso students cycling into the bike rakes outside Blackett were fined by\npolice officers one afternoon for going on the pavement for a couple\nof metres. And there were a few dodgy dealings in the ACC with the\nclubs belonging to the ACC Chair and the ACC Treasurer getting big\nincreases in their budget\u2026 bit below board I think.\nObviously we had elections for Sabbs as\nwell. Ashley Brown won President, Danny Hill\nwon Deputy President Finances & Services,\nJohn James won Deputy President Welfare,\nJonathan Silver won Deputy President Education and Jenny Wilson won Deputy President\nClubs and Societies. I don\u2019t remember who\nwon felix Editor can you?\n\n"

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Arts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nIs Sam Mendes building bridges?\nAmerican Beauty director Sam Mendes brings us a theatrical double bill as part of his ambitious Bridge\nProject. Caz Knight goes to see whether the cast reach the goal set for them.\nA\nccording to the Guardian\u2019s chief theatre critic,\nMichael Billington, seeing two great plays in\none day is a bit like gorging on peacock. I have not done neither but I would imagine bingeing on\nsuch a beautiful and rare bird would\nleave one feeling sick and full of guilt\n- certainly not how you feel after leaving the Bridge Project\u2019s production of\nThe Cherry Orchard and The Winter\u2019s\nTale. But then again I did see each play\non consecutive nights: a much more\nsensible and enjoyable option to gorging on peacock.\nThe Bridge Project theatre company\nwas created when Kevin Spacey and\nSam Mendes (of American Beauty\nfame, and much more) decided to pool\nresources and actors and resuscitate\nclassic plays: an American in London\nrunning a theatre and a Brit in New\nYork directing plays. Bridges were built\nand a stellar cast with a seeming abundance of energy and capacity to memo-rise lines came together to give us this\nChekhov/Shakespeare double bill of.\nThere was some trepidation among\nthe cast and director about performing such difficult plays and doing them\nback to back. One cast acting out two\nplays a day for the length of summer is\none hell of an order, but this cast lives\nup to the hype that the Bridge Project\nhas created. As director Sam Mendes\nsays, \u201cpressure is no bad thing\u201d.\nThe choice of plays could not be\nmore topical today, despite being written in 1904 (The Cherry Orchard was\nChekhov\u2019s last play) and 1623. Both\nare \u201ctragic comedies\u201d which move between scenes of devastation and angst\nto gay abandon and frivolity the next.\nThe Cherry Orchard tells of a rich\nfamily who are on the point of having\ntheir estate sold at auction to repay\ntheir debts built up from a life of deca-dence. The Winter\u2019s Tale tells us of a\nking, driven mad with jealousy when\nhe suspects his queen of cuckholding\nhim, to the point where he abandons\nhis new born and recently made motherless daughter. The daughter grows\nup a shepherd\u2019s daughter, falls in love\nand eventually finds herself back in her\nfather\u2019s court with her fianc\u00e9.\nTom Stoppard has adapted this\nChekhov play, the second of the Russian playwrights plays to be adapted\nby him for the West End in the last\nnine months (Ivanov starring Kenneth\nBrannagh showed at the Wyndham\u2019s\ntheatre in October 2008). As a Stoppard fan I thought this adaptation decidedly lacking his usual lightning wit.\nPerhaps this was on account of the\nsombre subject of the piece or because\nthis version should probably be credited to Helen Rappaport who translated\nthe play from Russian directly.\nAdaptations aside, the cast are su-perb. Rebecca Hall as the most demure\ndaughter, Varya, and Simon Russell\nBeale, as the servant turned business\nman Lopakhin, make for a powerful on\nstage match. Hall\u2019s choked sob creates\na palpable despair as Lopakhin fails\nto propose to her after a charged and\nsuggestive stroke of her face. The two\nactors recreated their onstage chemistry beautifully as King Leontes and the\nsuspected adulteress Hermione in The\nWinter\u2019s Tale, stealing both shows.\nSpecial mention must surely go to\nEthan Hawke who shatters any image\nI had of him as a generic action man.\nThe serious, eternal student, Trofimov, in The Cherry Orchard couldn\u2019t\nbe more different from his part as his\nEthan Hawke shows us there is a lot more to him than scrummy looks. As Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard\ncourt-jester/Jack Sparrow type char-acter, Autolycus, in The Winter\u2019s Tale.\nNot only does he inject a hefty dose of\ncomedy into the latter earning much\nriotous laughter, but he entertains with\nmany a song and strum on the guitar.\nAnother comical interlude comes from\nan impromptu hoedown which would\nnot be out of place in the deep south:\nthe red, white and blue balloons bringing back recent memories of the newly\nelected President.\nIf all the recent productions of\nShakespeare I have seen in the last year\nare to go by, then modern adaptations\nof Shakespeare entail adding as many\nlewd and crude gestures and innuendos as possible to get laughs and appeal\nto all the less theatre savvy. Luckily,\nThe Winter\u2019s Tale is all but devoid of\nthese apart from a few tugs and grabs\nat suggestively shaped balloons at the\nhoedown.\nThis endeavour from Mendes brings\ntogether two weighty plays and a\nstrong cast in the glorious Old Vic,\nmaking them both extremely accessi-ble. Seeing these actors in two plays on\ntwo nights only goes to show what they\nare made of. Whatever doubts they\nhad about the project should surely be\ndissolved by now.\nUntil 15 August 2009 at the Old\nVic, Waterloo\nSimon Russell Beale and Rebeecca Hall in The Cherry Orchard Ethan Hawke as Autolycus in The Winter\u2019s Tale\nShakespeare: pure and simple\nI\nknew absolutely nothing about\nHamlet before seeing this pro-duction, having never been\nsubjected to its over-analysis in\nschool, and not being the type\nto read Shakespeare for pleasure. A\nfriend helpfully informed me the plot\nis \u201cjust like in The Lion King\u201d (presum-ably with fewer lions and less singing),\nthough this similarity proved to be\ntenuous.\nI was lucky enough to have one of\nthe best seats in the small and civilised\nWyndhams Theatre \u2013 centre of the\nstalls, just close enough to the front.\nWithout a press ticket, this would have\nset me back \u00a332.50, which is actually quite moderate for a high-profile\nproduction in the West End. Standing\ntickets are available for a mere \u00a310, but\nwho wants to stand through a 3 hour\nplay?\nI won\u2019t bore you by relaying the plot\nof Hamlet in too much detail. The\nupshot of it is that Hamlet\u2019s father,\nthe King of Denmark, is dead and his\nghost appears to tell Hamlet that his\nuncle, Claudius, murdered him so he\ncould steal his throne and wife, Gertrude. Hamlet goes a bit mad, and in\nthe general madness kills Polonius,\nwho works for Claudius. Ophelia, Polonius\u2019s daughter and Hamlet\u2019s would-have-been girlfriend, is a bit upset\nby this and goes mad too. Then she\ndrowns herself, and ultimately everybody else ends up dead too. The End\n(sorry, Shakespeare).\nAs Shakespeare goes, it was better\nthan I had expected of a tragedy. It\u2019s not\nboring by any means. There are plenty\nof laughs and a sword fight (CLEARLY\nthe best bit!) to keep you entertained.\nThere were bits and bobs that went\nover my head, such as whatever was\ngoing on with Fortinbras, the prince\nof Norway. But I think anybody could\nunderstand who\u2019s who and what\u2019s going on. Three hours isn\u2019t as long as you\nmight think, particularly when there\u2019s\nan interval with ice cream on offer.\nBut why go and see this production\nin particular? A lot of people will go\nfor Jude Law, who stars as Hamlet.\nAdmittedly, he is an extremely good\nactor and his performance did not dis-appoint. He played the role with skill\nand emotion, making it funny in all\nNo futuristic settings, no conceptual adaptations, just the Bard at his simplest: how it should be. Emily\nWilson goes to review the Donmar West End\u2019s production of Hamlet, starring Jude Law.\nthe right places, without going over-board. But let\u2019s not forget the rest of\nan extremely good cast. I recognised\nPenelope Wilton, who plays Gertrude,\nfrom various television appearances,\nand she was a thoroughly capable in\nthe role. Ron Cook was an excellently\ncringe-worthy Polonius. Ophelia was\nplayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who\nwas generally good but didn\u2019t do a very\nconvincing job of going mad. There\nseems to be a misconception in theatre\nthat if you sing a bit, that means you\u2019ve\ngone mad \u2013 as Daniel Radcliffe did in\nEquus not so long ago. It really needs\nsomething more.\nPeter Eyre, who played the ghost of\nHamlet\u2019s father and the player king,\nwas outstanding. However, I do find\nthat when actors double up roles it can\nbe a little confusing if you\u2019re not familiar with the story. There were several\ncases of this here. Special mentions\nmost definitely go out to the very fine\nyoung men who played Rosencrantz\nand Guildenstern, Hamlet\u2019s chums,\nand Laertes, Ophelia\u2019s sword-wielding\nsibling. They provided top quality theatrical eye candy. And Hamlet\u2019s other\nchum Horatio wasn\u2019t bad either, sporting a nifty leather jacket and biker\nboots. Who says Shakespeare is stuffy?\nThere were other good things about\nthis particular production. There is no\narty farting about with setting it in a\nweird time period or making it \u201cconceptual\u201d. It was straightforward and basic with a plain castle-style set and simple black costumes (except the players,\nwho were in white \u2013 an effective dif-ferentiation). It left the play itself and\nthe skill of the actors to shine through,\nwhich is definitely how I think theatre\nshould be.\nI\u2019m not an expert on Shakespeare\nor even theatre in general, and this\nis the only production of Hamlet I\u2019ve\nseen, but I loved it. It\u2019s simple and accessible but well-constructed and with\nsome top quality actors. It was a fabulous afternoon out that leaves you with\nsomething to talk about and a greater\nappreciation of The Bard.\nHamlet is on at the Wyndham\u2019s\ntheatre until 22 August 2009\nThe Prince of Denmar who loses it: Jude Law as the lead role\n14 felix Friday 19 June 2009 115\nFriday 19 June 2009 felix\n\n"

I don\u2019t care if PhotoSoc form a lynch mob... you\u2019re shit.\nSad Clowns\nAh, the sweet clich\u00e9 that is the sad\nclown. Nobody can argue here. Sad\nclowns are awful, edging on scary, even\nif done for ironic comedy value.\nGerman Expressionism Art\nI saw an exhibition in my innocent\nteen years (cough) that involved a mixture of Impressionism and Expressionism from all over Europe and beyond.\nI noted that all the shittest ones were\nGerman. Because I am a fair and balanced journalists, I did look up German Expressionists on t\u2019interwebs, and\nI genuinely cannot find any that aren\u2019t\nvile. They\u2019re skanky mash-ups of lurid\ncolours that look like not a lot, though\nthey\u2019re probably supposed to be stuff.\nThoroughly shit. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 can\nyou name any good German artists?\nGerhard Richter\u2019s German, for a start.\nRight, I declare ALL German art to be\nshit.\nTigers and Wolves\nIf your favourite animal is a tiger or\na wolf, you probably need to be shot.\nLeast not because you\u2019re much more\nlike to own tiger/wolf \u201cart\u201d. You know\nthe kind I mean. They\u2019re usually in\nthe snow, under moonlight and on the\nback of a garment bought from a naff\nmarket stall. Or tattooed on the arm of\na serial killer with no taste. I could add\n\u201cunicorns\u201d and other offences to taste,\nbut it\u2019s the tigers and wolves that get\nto me.\nPrints of Famous Paintings\nWhile we\u2019re talking about art you\nmight actually own... is there Shit\nArt in your living room? What really\noffends me is prints of Monet\u2019s wa-terlillies, Van Gogh\u2019s chair, Renoir\u2019s\n\u2018Luncheon of the boating party\u2019... IT\u2019S\nSO NAFF. Plus somebody might be\nstupid enough to believe you own the\noriginal, which would send my head\ncolliding with the nearest blunt object.\nPlease do the art world a favour and\nburn your naff prints. Get something\ntasteful. I was going to declare \u201cart you\nbought in Ikea\u201d to be shit, but if it replaces a naff print then I\u2019ll tolerate it.\nArtsy Films\nYou know, when you\u2019re at Tate Modern and you turn a corner and find\nyourself in a dark room showing a film?\nThey\u2019re never good, are they? A memorable highlight was when I to, I think,\nthe Tate at St Ives, and there was a film\nof a man with a carrot wedged up his\narse, and he was wiggling about. That\nwas supposed to be art. WRONG. IT\u2019S\nNOT ART \u2013 it\u2019s a man with a carrot\nup his arse!! I also have mixed feelings\nabout that Dali film where somebody\ncuts into their own eyeball, and ants\nstart crawling out of their hand. It gets\nrolled out all too often, and it\u2019s more\ndisgusting than anything else. Blergh.\nLet\u2019s bin it.\nThe Art in the Library\nBy popular request. Seriously, it\u2019s a\nlibrary. Does it need art? No. Does it\nneed really shit art? Somebody (the\nrector?) apparently thinks so.\nYBAs\nThe Young British Artists, for those\nwhose lives have not been tarnished.\nThink Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin...\nbasically any British twat who has\nmade millions by churning out a pile\nof wank. I quite like certain Damien\nHirsts, but that\u2019s not to say he isn\u2019t a\nmassive twat on an epic scale. And\ndon\u2019t get me started on Tracey Emin.\nAlongside this article I was tempted to\nphotoshop a list of everyone I\u2019ve ever\nshagged onto a picture of my bed, but\nI\u2019m not a complete tosser so I am able\nto refrain.\nWank Theatre\nLook, if you do a Shakespeare play\nwhere all the characters are suddenly\nin Nazi uniforms, or you set it in the\nfuture, it\u2019s going to be shit. Leave The\nBard the fuck alone. Similarly, nobody\nwants to see your interpretative dance.\nJust don\u2019t.\nCelebrities in Art\nIf you\u2019re a moron like Sam TaylorWood (YBA twats strike again) then\nyou might think that a portrait of\nDavid Beckham sleeping is good. And\nif you\u2019re Julain Opie you can apparently achieve eternal admiration by\ndoing portraits of Blur, which seemed\ngood for about 5 minutes but are now\ndisgustingly over-exposed. Putting a\ncelebrity in your art will make you fa-mous, but it doesn\u2019t make you good.\n\u2018Dali is my favourite artist\u2019 or \u2018Omigod, I love surrealism\u2019\nThis is not Shit Art. I like both Dali\nand surrealism as a movement. But I\nhate hate HATE people who use these\nphrases, because they\u2019re guaranteed to\nbe epic cunts of the first order. Or really tragic teenage boys. Yes, Dali is a\nvery good artist, but there is OTHER\nART OUT THERE. Liking a few melting clocks does not make you \u201calternative\u201d or \u201cdark\u201d, it makes me want to\npunch you.\nThe Mona-Emily by famous art/inventor Lucy Harrold\nBling skull by YBA (Young Bullshit Artist) Damien Hirst\nAn example of German Expressionism, so shit it doesn\u2019t deserve a title\nCritic #2: Caz Knight\nAs an Arts editor I probably know\nmore than the next person about all\nthings of a cultural and artistic nature.\nAs one of Imperial College\u2019s arts editors I definitely know a lot more about\nthings of a cultural and artistic nature\nthan the next Imperial student. So, for\nthe last issue of term I will take a break\nfrom telling you about art worth seeing\nand instruct you in what art to avoid:\nshit art, basically. Here are my top five\noffenders.\nFrancis Bacon.\nHis dying wish was to have his remains put in a plastic bag and thrown\naway. This artist was an atheist of the\n\u201chardcore nihilistic\u201d kind (yes, do note\nmy closed minded choice of words)\nand sought to convey through his art\nlife has he saw it: one without God or\nafterlife. This was a man riddled with\nangst, living life in a state of \u201cexhilarated despair\u201d and this is brilliantly obvious when examining his paintings.\nOk, Ok, so what the man wasn\u2019t an\ninfuriating optimistic painting pictures\nof buttercups and daisies and sunshine\n(these would make for shit art, too) but\nBacon\u2019s work is macabre, visceral and\nnightmarish to the point of inducing\nnausea. Although Bacon is undoubtedly skilled at his art, his art still stinks.\nOf shit actually, as there is plenty of the\nstuff depicted in his art work which is\nnot surprising as Bacon was gay. And\nit\u2019s quite hard to avoid shit when anal\nsex comes up.\nCy Twombly.\nYet another revered artist who did\nthings like \u201cpave the way\u201d for new\ntypes of painting after American Abstraction\u2026 whatever that may mean.\nBasically, what Twombly does is get a\ncanvas or another surface appropriate\nfor making art on, and flick paint at\nit. Sometimes he will scribble. Other\ntimes, smear. The oft-heard, uneducated comment of \u201ca two year old could\nhave done that\u201d may be applicable\nhere. The main reason for Twombly\nmaking it here is because his paintings\ndo actually look like shit (the exhibition guide used the term \u2018scatological\u2019\nfrequently), as if shit were used instead\nof paint, or as if soiled sheets were used\nin place of a canvas. Cy also makes it\nhere because his name is shit too.\nConceptual art\nThis type of art could be described\nas art whose purpose is to convey a\nbroader message, and in doing this perhaps glorious originality is achieved. It\nhas the potential to be genius, mind-blowing, eye-opening. It can also be\nan excuse for artists to dress up their\nworks of crap with the excuse that they\nare conveying a message. Like Tracy\nEmin\u2019s damned bed, except I don\u2019t really see what message can be gained\nfrom that. It should be noted that\nmeaning can be found ANYWHERE.\nThere is a term for this propensity of\nours to find meaning where there is\nnone (apophenia) and this is why, now-adays, anything can be termed art. As\nlong as you can find a reason for why\nsomething is art, it is. This is, in one\nrespect, a great thing as it has expanded art\u2019s horizon and the way we see it.\nHowever, it also allows for exhibitions\nto take place which are wank. Take, for\nexample, the ICA\u2019s Dispersion exhibition which was held before Christmas\n2008. One piece was made up of video\nclips haphazardly flung together while\nlemming-like noises played over the\ntop. Another was a projection onto\nfour walls of a room of paint on a door\ndrying \u2013 PAINTING DRYING! Yet another looked like what pot-smoking,\nGCSE students would hand in for a\npiece of coursework entitled \u201cGay and\nlesbian artists: a few examples\u201d, complete with unglued-down, fraying edges of newspaper cuttings and dashes of\nhighlighter. Truly an aberration and I\nthink the ICA should be ashamed of\nthemselves.\nMusicals\nIt seems that, for some, the most\nflattering way to pay homage to something is to make it into a musical.\nShrek: the Musical!, Lord of the Rings:\nthe Musical!, Jade Goody: the Musical!\nI\u2019m still waiting for Barack Obama the\nMusical! I\u2019m shocked we haven\u2019t had\na Harry Potter: The Musical! but it\u2019s\nonly a matter of time. Love of money\nwill always win over artistic integrity, it\nseems. I know, these shows are always\nbig hits and so they can\u2019t be that shit,\ncan they? Wrong. The Crazy frog\u2019s album got pretty high in the chart, too,\nand that was wank. Most people do\nnot know anything about good theatre,\nhence, musicals. Yes, there is singing\nand smiling and dancing but most of\nthem are still shit. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nthough, shit can be a lot of fun. (I still\nlove mainstream 90s dance music).\nI find the music irritating as if it was\nonly half heartedly composed, the lyrics uninspired and the dance routines\nand accompanying frivolity tiring to sit\nthrough. I make exception only for The\nRocky Horror Show (the film version\nso it might not strictly be a musical).\nExcess of sexual innuendo\nI probably indulge in crass and crude\nhumour more than the average lady.\nBut I never do this when I am adapting\nor writing plays. (I have yet to do this).\nIt seems that the modern formula for\nadapting plays, especially the old clas-sics, is to revamp with plenty of innuendos and simulation fucking. Alternatively or in addition to, stick in lots\nof scantily clad slags and make sure\neveryone gets to say \u201ccunt\u201d a lot. This\nis meant to lure in and impress the\nplebs that would not usually go to the\ntheatre. Seeing two fully clothed people do it doggy style is hilarious! When\nyou are fifteen and haven\u2019t had sex yet.\nBut now, it grows a bit tiresome and\ncringe worthy after the fifth pretend\nblow job or watching someone moan\nand get fingered, especially if you are\nwith your mother. (This was at a play at\nthe Barbican and not anything else you\nmight be thinking of). Recent offenders include The Taming of the Shrew\n(we expected more, Royal Shakespeare\nCompany), Enjoy by Alan Bennett and\nPeer Gynt at said Barbican. How hypocritical of me, I have used expletives\nand innuendo aplenty in this \u201carticle\u201d.\nOops. This is why I don\u2019t direct plays.\nHenrik Olesen: the \u201cGCSE art student\u201d\nScat, anyone? Cy Twombly demonstrates his smearing ability\nThe man who brought us Imperial\u2019s arts magazine Pheonix: David Paw\nThis is not Caz Knight... or is it?\n\n"
