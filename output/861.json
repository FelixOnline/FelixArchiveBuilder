Dedication in this area will\nimprove the look and feel of news, features and the\narts.\nNews\nA news team and large news network has the\npotential to find out more about the stories that you\nshould know about.\nTechnology\nWith the introduction of more technology I shall move\nFELIX forward. The addition of a FAX and the\ninstallation of a JANET pad shall enable us to\ncommunicate across the UK.\nSt Mary's Collaboration in the form of weekly meetings with\nyour union and other interested party s' will source\nnews and feature contributions that needs to be\nexploited.\nSports and Clubs\nThe intense activity of all clubs and society s, whether\nsporting or not, is not as heavily reported as I would\nFELIX EDITOR\nI am proposing Thomas because I want next year's Felix to be better than this year's. Felix needs a change. Thomas is determined, enthusiastic, fair and\nhard-working. He first edited an award-winning 6th form magazine, and has since worked on publications\nfor the Petroleum Engineering industry. He will bring\nnew life and experience. Vote for him on March 5th and 6th for a Felix worth reading.\n-Dylan James, proposer.\nFelix\nFelix is boring, Hacks stuff its pages with what they\nthink students want-but this is simply not good\nenough.\nThe role of Felix is to provide news and information,\ninterest and entertainment. I feel that the news\ncontent of Felix must be improved. Coverage must\nbe comprehensive and information about forthcoming\nevents up to date.\nFelix must provide what students want, and\nparticularly what they cannot get elsewhere. Reviews,\nfor example, are better provided by commercial\nPRESIDENT\nDuring my involvement with ICU I have known three\npresidents. The most important qualities for a good\nPresident are not, having grand schemes for the\nUnion, or perfect knowledge of the constitution. They\nare; willingness to put in the long hours the job\ndemands, and the ability to respond to the people who\nwalk into the office with problems whilst you are\ntrying to concentrate on something else.\nOver the past year or so Doug has proved that he\nhas both of these qualities.\nPresident is no position of 'Ultimate Power'. The\nmajority of the President's time is spent in\nCommittees or dealing with students, this is what\nmakes the Union run. Doug has no illusions of the job\nhe is taking on and will do it the only way he knows\nhow: with absolute honesty.\nIf these aren't good enough reasons to vote for him\nplease do so anyway because if Doug leaves, the Bar\nprofits will plummet.\nHal.\nlike to see. With the cooperation of club chairpersons\nI would like to cultivate greater interest in this aspect\nof union life.\nFeatures\nNext year, Medicine and London life will mix with the\nalready excel lant general science and other articles of\nthis year.\nOpinion\nThough this maybe a college with an apolitical union\nwe are not all without opinion. Reflection on student\nand external life to goad your thoughts into action and\noff academia.\nUnion\nThe good, the bad and the ugly; all reported applauded\nand crit is is ed to ensure you know what is really going\non.\nLectures\nJournalism in all its forms is a fascinating subject. I hope to arrange a series of lectures drawing on the\nvast array of contacts that can be gleaned from this\nthe media capital of the world.\nmagazines.\nFelix must also be fun. Satire such as the 'Baron\nof Cheapskate' should be brought back; cartoons and\nlight-hearted articles re-introduced.\nI will use Felix to di spell alienation. It must be a window on the activities of college and a guide to the\naffairs of the Union. I will seek co-operation between\nFelix and the Union, Rag, St Mary's and other groups.\nI will honour responsibilities such as full publication\nof U. G.M. papers-although, ultimately, Felix should\nremain totally independent of the Union executive.\nMost of all, Felix must be accessible-it is your\nnewspaper. It exists for you, not just for hacks.\nAnybody with anything to say must feel free to use\nFelix as their forum.\nPrint Unit\nHaving expr ien ced the hostile nature of the Print Unit\nfrom the 'outside', I will ensure that it is more readily\naccessible to all students.\nICU has to be gently coaxed into doing new things,\nradical proposals are defeated or ignored by College.\nThe President must make the students his priority and\nto do this properly he probably won't have time to\npursue a vast number of projects.\nI don't intend radical change, but as many people\nalready know I am always prepared to talk with\npeople, anytime.\nThere are a couple of projects I would like to\nundertake. I want to try and set up a welfare fund to\nhelp students who are particularly hard hit by the\nwith drawl of benefits, introduction of loans, poll tax\netc. I would like to see more autonomy for the CCUs,\nwhich would ease future mergers.\nThese will be in addition to the ongoing necessities\nof protecting Harlington, student ac como dati on etc.\nSpace limits further elaboration.\nDOUGIE.\nNO BULLSHIT\nEditorial\nVelvet, sabre-toothed, ice cold and satirical. Good for\nthe good and bad for the bad. I shall cut and thrust\nwith an e pee for a tongue!\nThomas Wyatt, proposed by Dylan James\nDoug King, proposed by Hal Calamvokis\n\n"

Sec. and did a sterling job for Guilds in organising the Freshers'\nBuffets, Dinner and Dance and all the elections, he\nwas also an ordinary member of ICU Council. This\nyear he is chairman of the ICU House Committee and\nis a Council rep. to various committees.\nMurray's experience in College makes him the best\nqualified candidate for Hon. Sec. (Events)\nManifesto\nI am standing for Hon. Sec. because I want to do the\njob and will endeavour to do it well. I am not standing\non any political rostrum and did not chose the post\nof Hon. Sec. on the grounds that it was the sabbatical\npost with least opposition.\nAt present a great amount of the Hon. See's time\nis consumed by dealing with room bookings. Within\nthe next few months a suite of PCs is being purchased\nfor the ICU offices. With a computerised system the\nwhole booking process should be made more efficient.\nThis would then leave more time to organise the\ninternal and external events of ICU.\nA feeling around college is that the 'Union' runs the\nUnion for itself. If the same people always attend the\nUGMs then policy brought up will reflect their views.\nTo get other people to attend better publicity is\nneeded, also contentious issues always get a good\nturn out.

What I guarantee is a rerun of the election\nor elections in which I win. If you think that all of the\ncandidates standing for a post are useless, then vote\nfor me.

    "content": "PRESIDENT Mark Orrow-Whiting, proposed by Edgar Denny\nI am standing for ICU president so that the union fights\nover issues concerning students-loans, poll tax,\nabortion, etc.\nThe loans proposals will reduce students' living\nstandards. Many working class students will be\ndiscouraged from entering higher education.\nThe Poll Tax represents a huge shift of wealth from\nthe poor to rich. In Scotland there has been massive\nnon-payment. A campaign of non-payment and\ndemonstrations is needed.\nNext year the effects of student loans, poll tax, and\nbenefit cuts will start to bite. Students, already on the\nbread line, will face a desperate situation. A union\nwhich fails to tackle these issues is useless.\nThe Tories have allowed anti-abortion amendments\nto the Embryo Research Bill. Attempts to reduce the\ntime limit for abortion represents an attack on a woman's right to choose. The loss of abortion rights\nwould mean a return to the backstreet s for women\nunable afford private abortions.\nOn these issues the government can be beaten.\nStudent pressure caused the banks to withdraw from\nthe loans scheme. Recent opinion polls show the\nTories are vulnerable.\nWe need a fighting union to take on these and other\nissues. One that organises campaigns and\ndemonstrations rather than writing letters to MPs.\nOfcourse, these campaigns would be much more\neffective if we were part of the national union.\nThe last few months have been exhilarating for\nsocialists. Oppressive regimes in Eastern Europe have\nfallen. In many cases students acted as a catalyst for\nthe revolutions. Nelson Mandela has walked free.\nStudents here should take inspiration from these\nevents. The best form of solidarity we can offer is to\nget rid of Thatcher.\nI am in Physics II and a member of Socialist Worker\nStudent Society.\nPRESIDENT Athos Ritsperis, proposed by Alistair Goodall\nI am proposing Athos for President because I believe\nhe is the best person for the job.\nHe has proved an excellent Academic Affairs\nOfficer, tackling the important issues that arose. As\nCU President he's helped build up and maintain an\nactive and thriving College society.\nI know he will run the Union well, but more\nimportantly I know as President he will remain friendly\nand approachable to all.'\nAlistair Goodall (ICCAG Chair 89/90).\nApathy: Apathy is a real problem. If you don't understand what's going on, it's not because you\naren't interested, it's because nobody tells you. I will\nensure that you are kept aware of the issues.\nSt Mary's: St Mary's and IC Unions are required to\nmerge within 3 years. Having talked to both\nPresidents I believe we have an answer that will\nsatisfy College, without compromise.\nAcademic Affairs: I 've seen numbers of applications\nto College go down almost across the board, with\nworkloads on the increase. I have, as Academic\nAffairs Officer instigated a workload survey in all\ndepartments. I will be keeping a close watch on the\nsituation.\nCollege: In this time of cutbacks it seems that College\nhas turned it's attention to the student services\n(careers service, Nightline, and sporting facilities). I will not let College dictate on these issues. These\nservices are necessities, not luxuries.\nWelfare: I intend to expand the service, adding\ninformation on private sector rented accommodation\nand other housing issues, in conjunction with the\nexisting details on Poll tax, benefits, rights, loans, etc.\nOverseas: I understand the issues facing Overseas\nstudents and know a lot can be done to make them\nfeel a more welcome part of the Union. I intend to see\nmore social events like the very successful\ninternational night, promoting cross-cultural relations.\nPRESIDENT Paul Shanley, proposed by Andrew Bannister\nIn terms of ability and experience, I believe that Paul\nShanley has all the qualifications needed to make an\nexcellent Union President. As well as being UGM Chair\nthis year, he has sat on most major Union committees,\nincluding Council, Union Finance, Bar, Bookshop,\nCatering, Publications Board and Academic Affairs.\nHe has also represented IC at GUC-the sovereign\nbody of the University of London Union.\nPreviously, he worked full-time in College\nadministration for fifteen months. His responsibilities\nincluded supervising twenty part-time members of\nstaff, and working with senior College officials.\nI have no hesitation in proposing Paul Shanley for\nthe post of President of Imperial College Union.\nAndrew Bannister.\nThe Union President needs not only commitment, but\nalso an all-round experience of both the Union and\nCollege. The President will need to negotiate firmly\nwith College on a wide range of issues, and this can\nbest be achieved if good relations with College\nofficials have already been established.\nSpecifically next year I intend to:\n\u2022 Press for improvements in College accommodation.\nThis will be achieved by preparing a detailed report\non each hall or house, for presentation to the Student\nResidence Committee.\n\u2022 Investigate ways in which College could sub sid is e rents via externally generated income, such as\nconference letting.\n\u2022 Increase the integration of postgraduate students\ninto the Union, by improving PG representation and\nmaking better use of the postgraduate budget.\n\u2022 Strongly oppose any detrimental changes to the\nCareers Service, such as cutbacks in funding or\nstaffing levels.\n\u2022 Try to get College to turn Harlington back into a sports ground.\n\u2022 Keep students regularly informed of Union issues\nvia a weekly piece in FELIX.\nPaul Shanley.\n\n"
