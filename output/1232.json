    "content": "clubbing reviews\nLondon Xpress\n93 Feet East\nLondon Xpress once again puts on a lineup that is just that little bit different.\nWith headline sets from Rob Birch of\nStereo MCs fame and Richard Thair, formerly of Red Snapper, this is definitely a night that stands out from the rest on the\nclubbing calendar.\nThe crowd is rather different from the\nusual menagerie of posers, pill heads and\nbeer boys that you might expect at a club\nin London. There is an air of sophistication about the place, an air of culture, of\nself-knowing cool. But that doesn't mean\nthey don't enjoy a little boogie. Indeed,\nthere are three whole rooms to shake\nyour thang to: the dark and slightly\nindustrial main room is perfectly complimented by the casual, party-esque side\nbar and the smart and stylish loft bar\nwith adjoining terrace.\nThe side bar is like a decompression\nchamber - sitting here and chatting\nwh list listening to the Nuphonic label's very own Jools Butterfield allowed me to\nrelease all that inner city madness and\nget ready for the main room.\nRichard Thair's heavy-duty mix of\njazzy, soulful bass and tribal drums\nbrought hints of the Red Snapper sound,\nbut also indicated his new musical dire c tion. This intense and heady set certainly got my approval, and now that Thair\nhas moved to Bristol, I can only look forward to the next time he plays London.\nDue to an unfortunate cold, I didn't make it to closing time, or even to the\nRob Birch set. Damn.\nOrdinarily, I find that this club seems to\nfinish too early, closing its doors at 2am. But I guess it is always better to go out\non a high.\nEvery 4th Saturday Doors open at 8pm. INTERVIEW with\nRed Snapper\nRed Snapper are Richard Thair, Ali Friend\nand David Ayers. They came together in\nthe early nineties to produce their calling\ncard blend of jazz, funk and hip-hop.\nAfter seven years, they have recently\nannounced that Red Snapper is to come\nto an end.\nFELIX: As you are all here together, I guess the end of Red Snapper has been\nquite an amicable one?\nRichard: Yes, we're all really good\nfriends, so we never let it get to a situation where we all fall out - we're really\nnot that sort of people. Our motivation\nhad always been to write and perform\nunusual music, and maybe we had just\ngone as far as we could as a threesome\nAnd in what ways are you each going\nto do your own thing?\nRichard: I'm DJing quite a lot and I 've\nstarted a band called Toob, I 'll be doing\nthe live drums for that. It's much more\nelectronic than Snapper - we didn't ever\nuse a lot of percussion in Snapper, so\nthere's quite a lot of that.\nAli: I'm working with Ted Barnes: the\ntwo of us write with Beth Orton. We've\ndone some stuff for her new album as\nwell as setting up our own thing which\nwill hopefully turn out to be a live band.\nIt's going to be a lot more melody-based.\nDavid: I have a studio that I run alongside my partners Felix Todd - he's a producer - and Alan McGee, and the three of\nus have just started up a venture called\nCreation studios. So in addition to my\nown stuff, I 'll be producing up and coming bands and artists.\nWell that's the future, but in your time\nas Snapper, do you feel that you did\neverything you wanted to do?\nRichard: We didn't start out with a plan,\nso everything that happened was a complete surprise.\nAli: It was like \"Whoa, it's another\nalbum!\"\nDavid: I'm proud of all the albums we\nmade. We made music that we are really\nproud of and we got to play a lot of great\ngigs, see some of the world and have a good time.\nSo is there any chance that you guys\nare going to collaborate again on any\nfuture projects?\nRichard: Personally, I'm sure of it. There'll\nalways be bits of music that each of us\nwill do that'll need some guitar or something - in that way we can collaborate on\nthings...\nDavid: It's just that it might not be called\nRed Snapper. These guys are still the\nbest musicians I know so I would definitely want to work with them.\nAli: The whole point with us is that we\ndo different things - that's what Snapper\nwas all about. Hopefully that's what\nwe're all about as individuals.\nBed Snapper's final EP, Heavy Petting,\nis out this week on Nuphonic.\nPatrick Patrick\n\n"

    "content": "felix talk\nChaplaincy - The Eden Project\nOver the weekend, of 1-3 March the\nChaplaincy Centre organised a visit to the\nEden Project in Cornwall. It was also a chance to reflect upon related questions.\nThese included personal and community\nresponses to global environmental\nthreats; different perceptions of nature;\nand the contemporary use of the texts\nand images of creation.\nGillian Straine, a post-graduate studying atmospheric physics, offers her reactions to the latest environmental and\nengineering wonder of the world.\n\"The Eden Project is without a doubt a fantastic conception, built in what would\nhave been an ugly quarry pit. There are\ntwo huge Martian bio-domes, with a Tracy island type construction straddling\nthem containing the essential restaurant\nand gift shop. The whole place seemingly\noperates on uncommonly good ethics.\nThe guide says they embrace the ideas\nand outlook of the young but, says the\ncynic, has the wisdom of the old been\ntaken into consideration? Leaving aside\nthe nightmare of Jurassic Park chaos of\nman being destroyed by his creation, can\nit really work? Inside both the domes, the\nplant life of different regions of our planet\nare displayed side by side. The paying\ncustomer can amble through the tropics\nof South America before heading past\nhumidifiers to the tropics of the Pacific\nand on into Africa.\nThe array of plants is stunning. The history of the plants and our use of them are\nclearly displayed. It is a living, working\nexperiment having only been opened for\none year. But can it work?\nIn my research I use computer models\nto simulate the atmosphere of Earth. Yet\nfor all the computing power we can't come close to recreating our weather and\nclimate. We end up making large assumptions and achieve a rough idea, the system being so complex. So, again, can the\nEden project work?\nInsects aren't welcome so some of the\nplants have to be artificially pollinated.\nAnd of course, there isn't any weather in\nthe domes so they have to get the hoses\nout and create a monsoon at the right\ntime. For many species the flowering season is extended for the visitors.\nOur guide told us she was nearly hit by\na falling tree that had not formed roots.\nThey hadn't got a dud plant, or the wrong\nsoil. There was just no wind to shake the\ntree enough for it to have to form them.\nAnd that is probably only the tip of the\niceberg.\nYou can recreate the right temperature\nand you can get the native plants but\nwith so much that you can't get the system will start to diverge from reality. Not\nthat we won't learn a great deal on the\nway. I praise Eden and think we need\nmore exciting ambitious projects where\nthe ways of the past are challenged. But\nas for recreating such a complex beast as\nour planet's whole diverse flora environment in two greenhouses, it just can't be\nthat easy.\"\nTo see pictures of Eden and the trip\nvisit www.chaplaincy.ic.ac.uk\nin!\u00a9\nPhotoSoc Exhibition 2002\nA Display of Photographic Art and Talent\nOpening Night\nTuesday 12th J March. \u2022\n6.30pm Blyth Art Space\nTuesday 12th March\n-End of Term\n5th Floor Sherfield\nBuilding,\nBlyth Art Space.\nAll welcome!\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/photos oc imperial \u2022 \u2022 college\nunion "

    "content": "college news\nCouncil Were Efficient\nThe most efficient meeting of\nUnion Council this year took\nplace on Thursday, which finally resolved debate over\nthe new constitution and controversy about the recent sabbatical elections.\nThe Union Exists\nThe sabbatical team and\nUnion Council have spent\nmuch of the recent months\nwriting and approving a new constitution, which will bring\nthe Union in line with College's new faculty st ruc ture.\nDiscussion of this paper,\nwhich must be passed by two\nconsecutive Council meetings,\nhas lasted hours in the past\nbut on this occasion was hampered by only two points. The\nfirst objection related to the\ndepartmental representatives'\nplace on Council, while the\nsecond proved more unusual,\nwhen Mustafa Arif, President\nof the City & Guilds\nConstituent College Union,\nproposed an amendment to\nabolish the body of Council\nitself. The idea was to replace\nCouncil meetings with larger\nstudent general meetings,\nwhich would be attended by\nmore 'non-hack' students.\nHowever, many argued that\nthere would be persistent failure to get anything done due\nto suspected low turnout.\nEventually, Council failed to\nself-destruct along the lines of\nthe Royal College of Science\nUnion, and declined to pass\nMr Arif's amendment.\nThe new constitution and\nregulations now have only to\nget College's final approval\nbefore coming into full effect\nat the beginning of the next\nacademic year.\nElections Again\nThe Committee in charge of\nthis year's sabbatical elections also submitted their final\nreport to Council.\nComplaints made by Ms Munir (see Felix 1131) had\nbeen previously overturned by\na very close margin at Union\nExecutive, but they did not\nmake their expected reappearance at Council, when\nshe decided not to appeal the\ndecision. There was some consternation when a Council\nmember pointed out that Wye\nstudents had not been given\ntwo days' voting, but after a brief break, Council heard that\nno complaint had been intended and the report was passed.\nIt now looks far less likely\nthat any complaints will overturn the election results, and\nas such they will become fixed\non Monday.\nIssue 1232\n20 March 2002\nEditor: will Dugdale\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews: John Stratford\nMusic: Dave Edwards\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nSport: Alex Coby\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nComic: J With Thanks To:\nEveryone\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nSykes Quits GSK News In Brief\nSir Richard Sykes has\nannounced that he is to stand\ndown as non-executive chairman of GlaxoSmithKline in\nMay.

    "content": "INTERVIEW with Didz from\nThe Cooper Temple Clause\nYou know as well as I do that The Cooper Temple Clause are the\nNext Big Thing, M. Their music captures the best aspects of electronica, grunge, rock and indie, puts them in a blender and\nmakes the tastiest musical smoothie you'll drink this year.\nUnfortunately, there's no guarantee that any of the information in this interview is correct - the band are well known for\nattempting to spread rumours about themselves that are, quite\nfrankly, false. And considering that this interview was conducted by 'phone, well, there's no telling...\nFELIX: So, your new single hit the top twenty last week - how\ndoes that feel?\nDIDZ: It was good, the nicest part of it was being able to do\nmusic shows on the telly, playing for all those kids who like Al and stuff. It's not like I 've got something against Al, it's just\nthat they were on right before us on Top Of The Pops.\nCan you give us a good reason to buy your album?\nI think because we're not really like anything else out there. I mean, some people say we're like Muse, but that's because\nthey're not afraid to experiment with sounds either.\nWhat inspires your lyrics?\nA lot of it is just unoriginal stuff, like boy meets girl kind of\nthing, and that's really important, it's a good thing to write\nabout. But some of it is just about personal or emotional situations, events, scenarios, contemplating suicide, you know.\nWhat kind of stuff did you listen to as a kid?\nWell, we all listened to grunge and brit-pop, but after a while\nwe realised there wasn't anything new out there that we wanted to listen to, so we decided to get together and make our own.\nWhat do you listen to now?\nQuite a lot of stuff, I think if you listen to our album you can get\nquite a good idea. Quite a lot of electronica and indie stuff, Muse\nand Radiohead.\nPeople say you're quite similar to Radiohead - do you take\nthat as a compliment?\nWell, Radiohead are a great band. They're probably one of our\nfavourite bands, collectively. Definitely in the top... three. So\nyeah, definitely a compliment.\nWho did you want to win Pop Idol?\nI don't care, it's shit. It's really stupid, it's like dangling a carrot\nunder the kids' noses to give them something new to drool over.\nI suppose Darius has got a bit of talent. We played football\nagainst him once, I think he was in goal. He was rubbish.\nHave you been to any good gigs recently?\nYeah, we went to a good gig a couple of days ago, we went to\nsee ...Trail Of Dead at the Astoria, that was absolutely inc redi ble. In fact, me and Tom, when we go to a gig with a decent\nband and a decent-sized venue, we always go down the front\nand try a bit of crowd-surfing.\nJess\nThere's loads more to this, but I just couldn't fit it all in. Go to\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/felix for the full interview. You'll also find full\nversions of several other interviews we've done recently. Dave\nmusic reviews\nLIVE: The Charlatans +\nThe Cooper Temple Clause\n+ Minuteman @ Astoria\nIt seemed, from the size of the crowd this evening, that\nMinuteman are not a particularly well-known band. The four-piece launched into a pretty indiscriminate indie-guitar set,\nwhich was entirely forgettable apart from a haunting feeling\nthat someone had just done a cover version of Radiohead's True\nLove Waits. Which, strangely enough, nobody had.\nAs always, The Cooper Temple Clause (pic above) were on top\nform. They played through the whole range of emotions - from\nthe crazed stalker (Film Maker) to the lonely, suicidal man\n(Murder Song). Didz, as is customary, waltzed on two minutes\nlate, and Ben managed to break at least two tambourines by the\nend of the forty-minute set. Nothing new there, then.\nThis band are completely in love with music, and all they're\ndoing is allowing other people to appreciate that. Perhaps that's something that the hundred or so heckling Charlatans fans\nshould have thought about.\nIf you get a chance to see the Coopers, then do. They're well\nworth it, time and time again, for the sheer amount of energy\nthat this Reading six-piece can unleash is simply amazing.\nI'm sorry. The Charlatans were completely upstaged by their\nsupport. After hearing The Cooper Temple Clause play their set,\nwe could only manage four Charlatans songs before walking\nout in disgust at the lack of anything even remotely interesting.\nA few of the more intelligent people in the crowd followed suit.\nWe pieced together the information we had, and decided that\nthey'd definitely played their best song, Love Is The Key, first.\nAs people poured out of the Astoria, we heard tales of Tim\nBurgess juggling and the set being good. Believe what you will.\nJess\n\n"

    "content": "back talk\nson al remarks made against\nme, I thought it was appropriate to outline some of the decisions taken and the reasons\nbehind them.\n(a) The Indian Society\nCommittee were made\nfully aware of the fire\ncapacity in advance and\nconfirmed in a meeting a week before their event.\nThe fact is that there were\n640 people in the audience\nand 150 performers, giving\na total of 790 people. The\ncapacity of the M DH is 400.\nDespite several requests, a second over fill room was\nnot booked. The Union had\nto intervene and put a booking for the J CR to\nensure that there was\nspace to cater for the\nexcess.\n(b) There were professional\nDoor Staff working on the\nnight using click ers, and to\nclaim that they miscounted\nis serious allegation. By\nlaw, the fire capacity cannot be exceeded and it\nwould be criminal offence\nto do so.\n(c) The Indian Society nearly\nbreached the License\nagreement by planning to\nadvertise in national\nmedia. The Union again\nintervened to pull the\nadvertising and stop the\nauthorities from closing\ndown the event.\nI take offence to the allegations made in the letter, I totally refute the claim that the\nUnion had persecuted Indian\nSociety. The truth of the matter is that if the Union had not\nstepped in, the show would\nhave been shut down due the\ndifficulties experienced by the\norganisers. We acted in the\nbest interest of our members\nand took action to ensure the\nsafety of all guests.\nI would like to congratulate\nthe Indian Society Committee\non organising a very successful event. We work with societies to continually improve\nour procedures and services,\nbut the Union always welcomes constructive criticism\nthat allows us to improve\nthings for all.\nSen Ganesh , President,\nImperial College Union\nCarry-on NUS\nDear Felix,\nA sudden and happy thought\ncame to me. It occurred to me\nthat there exist two similar,\nyet very different organisations. Both of them are spent as\npolitical forces, though they\naspire to hold the clout that\nthey did 15 years ago.\nBoth have changed from powerful organisations sticking up\nfor their customers, to two\nclapped out, desperate collections of uninspired rightwing\ngents.\nBoth of them are as useless to\nthe public as they are good at\neating up people's money.\nOne of them is a tabloid rag,\nthe other is a national student\nbody.\nAnd their names are anagrams of each other. - can you\nguess what they are?\nEoghan\nDear Felix,\nI'm just writing to express my\ngeneral disgust that members\nof the NUS executive have\nbeen around college (though\nnoticeably not on college or\nunion grounds) this week, following the debate in the great\nhall, distributing flyers to\neveryone that walks past. Do\nthese people not have jobs to\ndo? If the NUS can afford to\nhave its key players wandering around distributing flyers\nall day instead of fighting on\nstudents' behalves, is it really\nthe kind of organisation that\nwe should be joining?\nThis referendum is being held\namongst Imperial College stu-dents, so surely they are the\nonly ones who should try to\ninfluence the outcome - yet\nanother example of the NUS\nsticking its nose in where it's not wanted I guess.\nRegards,\nNeil Manson (Materials I) And, Finally...\nDear William,\nFar away from the evils of capitalism and union officers,\nthere's one small thing that's bugging me about College I wish I'd pointed out last year.\nWhy does virtually every student talk to catering staff as if\nthey're human-shaped vending machines? In the best\ncases, students seem to grunt\nacknowledgement, in the\nworst case ignore them alto-get her. When you're paying for\nyour food or someone's cleared\nyour table for you, is a simple\n\"Thanks\" too much to ask?\nI know I'm starting to sound\nlike a Daily Mail reader, but\nwhile students can seem to\nget away with treating service\nstaff as sub-human here,\nbefore you know it you'll all be\nacting like that in cafes and\nrestaurants - and I know for a fact if you're rude in places\nlike that they WILL spit in\nyour food!\nJust trying to make the world\n(and more hygienic) a better\nplace.\nJohn Clifford (Physics III)\n\n"

    "content": "reviews clubbing\nMixmag\n@ Cargo\nCargo is one of the new-ish clubs that\nhave sprung up in the trendy area east of\nOld Street. Set in a railway arch, it does-n't look too glam from the outside, but as\nyou approach, you notice the arty graffiti\nand the glass doors and realise that this\nis full-on Hoxton.\nOnce past the snooty door staff, the\ninterior is decked out in wood and\nleather, with cute design features\nwhipped out of the pages of Wallpaper.\nThere are large screens around the venue\ndisplaying tr rp py visuals. Cargo isn't huge, so it retains some cosines s and\nmakes it easy to find friends that have\nwandered off. It also describes itself as a \"zero tolerance\" venue, so keep those\nbif ter s subtle or you'll be out.\nBack to the evening. Agent Sumo\nplayed some funky house which was\nbearable but nothing special. A friend\nabsolutely loved it though, so what do I know? Lisa Lashes was up next with a banging, eclectic set, playing everything\nfrom breakbeat to electro, through hard\nhouse and hip-hop. This got the dance\nfloor heaving, with many a punter trying\nto get a better look at Lisa's decks.\nLashes was the highlight for me (and if\nyou care, the low point was probably\nclubbing editor Alex puking, at a bus stop\nat 2am). The last DJ was Judge \"won't budge\"\nJules, taking a bit of a diversion from his\nusual hard trance style with some funkier house after midnight.\nThe sound system was great - big and\nbass y, without getting too muffled and\nwith no dead spots either. If you are a house fan or you just like to look cool,\nthen this night is for you.\nEvery third Wednesday. 7pm lam. \u00a35.\nTomX\nHeaven Scent\n@ Po Na Na\nThis night is run in conjunction with\nRoehampton Students' Union.\nRoehampton, I hear you cry, never heard\nof it. Well Roehampton, while not exactly\nfamed as a hotbed for great intellectuals,\nseems to have a fairly impressive number\nof students of the fairer sex, making a welcome change from IC.\nThe event was, in fact, a school disco.\nI'm sure most of you have been to one by\nnow, and if not then you'll probably be\nfamiliar with the concept. It's on once a month, but there are different themes\nevery Tuesday including dressing up as\nmovie stars and the infamous Shag Tag\nnights.\nWhile many may feel that the School\nDisco phenomenon has moved rather\nrapidly from cult to clich e, it is definitely\nall the better for being a student night.\nObviously it's cheaper, at just \u00a33, and you\nget away from any dreaded 30-some-thing office party ambience.\nI could talk about the music, but\nthere's no point really with this sort of\nnight - you know full well that come lam you'll be dancing like a muppet to Come\nOn Eileen next to some young girl in\nstockings and suspenders. After all,\nthat's why one attends such wonderful\nevents. Or if you're the esteemed clubbing editor, you'll nip behind the\nmetaphorical bike sheds with a real ten-pinter.\nBut enough of such frivolity, for what\nremains is a word for the venue. It is\ncolossal, big enough even for the largest\nof congas, and better still, it was\nabsolutely rammed come midnight.\nSo if you want a fun, cheesy and inexpensive night out anytime soon, there\ncan't be many better than this.\nBBBB B Rocco Siffredi\nBedrock\n@ Heaven\nHeadlining at Bedrock is usually John\nDigweed (sometimes accompanied by\nhis chum Sasha), ably supported by Phil\nThompson, with random s in the other\nrooms.\nThe main room plays progressive\nhouse, the first floor room plays breakbeat and drum 'n' bass, and the mezzanine room plays harder house. We were\nsome of the first in there, so the atmosphere was muted, but you could feel tension building underneath the low rhythm\nof Thompson's set. There were some fan-t asic violence/reaction sociology study\nvisuals that stayed in tune with the\nmusic.\nThe Bedrock crowd were relaxed and\ncasual, with a \"here to dance\" attitude\nand none of the well-documented lack of\natmosphere that typifies most other\nLondon clubs.\nA quick tour of the other rooms turned\nup some fairly good stuff, but we soon\ntired of this and returned to the large\nroom for Digweed's set. The crowd was\nheaving, and the man didn't disappoint.\nThe basslines were hard and funky, and\nduring the breakdowns when we didn't think he could come back with anything\nbetter, Digweed pulled another storm er out of the bag. The strobe lights were out\nin force, the noise was deafening, the\nrhythm was pulsating, and the experience was awesome.\nWe rocked 'til the early hours, and the\ndance floor was packed until the final\ntune. The crowd bayed for more, and\nwere rewarded with a grand finale of a Come With Us remix. Tired but content,\nwe joined the bun-fight for the cloakroom\nand crawled out of the club.\nEvery first Thursday of the month.\nBBBB B Tom F "

    "content": "talk felix\nHindu Society's SEWA\nSEWA literally means \"ser v ice\" and that's exactly what \u2022\nIC Hindu Society did from\nFriday 22nd February to\nFriday 1st March. As a team,\nmany members of our society came together to help\nraise money for SEWA inter-national. All the Hindu societies across the country\ncome together as part of a national campaign with 'The\nNational Hindu Students\nForum'\nSEWA International is a charity group who have several\nprinciple roles, which include:\n\u2022 To relieve poverty, disease and help the\nneedy, the weak and those affected by\nnatural calamities, disasters and other\nsuffering.\n\u2022 To educate and propagate and principles as enunciated in Hindu Dharma with\nparticular reference to serving the poor,\nsick, needy and weak.\n\u2022 To help in the education and training of\nthe poor, sick, disabled and socially backward students and assist them financially.\nOver this week, many of us took our\ntime to organise and participate in various events, to help the victims of the volcano eruption in Goma, Congo and help\nthose in Gujarat, India after the earth-quake. The sheer variety of events was\nenormous and included:\n\u2022 Friday 22nd Feb - Wet Sponge throwing\n- On a cloudy Friday lunchtime, Sunil Pala\nand myself decided to get soaked to the\nbone by various students oi -'\ncollege, all in the name of charity,\nas a warm-up start to Se\nWeek. After Sunil got dr erich ed, yours truly had 2 buckets of cold\nwater poured over him, and got\nsponges bashed in my face from j all angles. It was great fun to\nwatch and to see me and Sunil\nsuffer (Ash and Jital, it will be\nyour turn next year).\n\u2022 Sunday - Working in the IC\nSoup Kitchen - we went with the\nsoup kitchen, in a packed\nminibus, to Holborn and distributed sandwiches, hot drinks and\nblankets to the homeless. It gave\nus all a chance to understand the life\nhomeless people lead and the daily difficulty of living on the streets of London.\nThe IC Community Action Group are\ndoing a wonderful job of helping the\nhomeless, and I urge you, as when you\ncan, to go and help them.\n\u2022 Monday - Bollywood Film Night - For\nthis event, we managed to obtain a lecture theatre, and we were able to show\nthe Oscar nominated film, Lagaan (which\nis 4 hours long), which I'm sure we know\nis all about the game of cricket! We had a fairly good attendance, whilst Deepti and\nSheena slaved away at making some\namazing popcorn !\n\u2022 Tuesday - Slave Auction - Trishul Darji\nhad some radical idea of organising a slave auction, which was extremely lucrative to many of us in the college. At\nlunchtime, 10 members from both IC\nfern I Hindu and Indian societies, put\nthemselves up for auction in the\nBMS Student Union room. The\nstage was set and bidding\nbegan. Upto \u00a350 was bid for just\none person!! The total raised\nfrom this event alone was a staggering \u00a3270.\n\u2022 Wednesday - 5-a side football\ntournament - Once again, a cloudy day b leaked over Hyde\nPark, yet this did not dampen our\nhopes for a5 a side football tour-name nt. We had thirteen teams\nfrom all over London, who competed with all their might\nagainst one another, to become\nSEWA champions. IC Hindu Soc\nlost their three games, but the fun of playing in such a tournament was worth\nevery moment. The champions were a mixture of the Sikh Society of Imperial\nCollege and the City Guilds Squad, so our\ncongratulations to them. It was great that\nteams from UCL, City and Q MW came\ndown to support the needs of SEWA.\n\u2022 Thursday - Individual Events - Today,\nwe all decided to do something individually to raise money for SEWA. Many activities included a24 hour silence, 24 hour\nfast and 24 hour mobile free day.\nHowever, the highlight was the painful\nleg waxing of various members of Hindu\nand Indian Society. Sunil, Nikhil, Anil and\nAmardeep from SSC all got their legs\nwaxed by various members. Jital and\nPranati made the guys suffer by slowly\nyet notoriously removing the wax. Some\nof the guys were on the verge of crying\nwhilst others quoted\n\"Mummy\" (Jital gave me the\nquotes).\nSEWA week was extremely successful, and we managed to help raise a substantial amount of money to help\nthese innocent victims. We\nalso had a great deal of fun in\nseeing others suffer, all in\nthe name of charity: many of\nus will not forget leg waxing\nin particular. IC Hindu\nSociety would like to take\nthis opportunity to thank\neverybody who participated\nand donated for SEWA.\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nSahara Hotnights\nJennie Bomb\nRemy Zero\nThe Golden Hum\nHAMMONDfSl\nSTREET NWS\nmm. ^dte Ti yi'. Various\nHammond Street\nOut now on RCA records Out now on Eastwest/Electra records Out now on Acid Jazz records\nTo quote the band's publicity material,\nSahara Hotnights were formed in\nNorthern Sweden when \"four [female]\nfriends, united by a mutual love for\nNirvana, coupled with the boredom that\na small town existence inspires, decided\nto pool their collective musical talents\ninto chasing the rock 'n' roll dream\". I'd guess that they still like Nirvana, and\nthat they're still chasing that rock 'n' roll\ndream. But now they're the ones inspiring boredom.\nSahara Hotnights are a \"proper, good\nold-fashioned\" band, in the sense that\nNorth By Northwest is a \"proper\" film,\nand the Eton Wall Game is a \"good old-fashioned\" sport. There are no frills and\nno messing about. On Jennie Bomb, their\nsecond album, the guitars have only got\none setting (punk-heavy), the drummer\nonly plays one beat (punk-heavy) and the\nlargely uninspiring lyrics can only be\ndescribed as, er, punk and heavy.\nHowever, I must admit that what they\ndo, they do well. Maria Andersson's voice is faultless, and with song titles\nlike Alright Alright (Here's My Fist\nWhere's The Fight?), you know that their\nhearts are in the right place. And they've\nbeen nominated for a couple of Swedish\nGrammy awards too, so maybe up in\nScandinavia they appreciate good punk a little more than I do.\nBut I'm going to stand by my con clu sion. The Hotnights are clearly influenced by most of the great punk acts,\nplus of course the Nirvana method of\nwriting songs around one good hook. The\nproblem is, if the hooks aren't much\ngood, then neither is the band.\nRemy Zero - a strange name, but I like it.\nIn fact, without much knowledge of their\nmusic, it's the main reason why I decided to review this album, and I'm pleased\nI went with my gut feeling.\nThe first track is one of those intros\nthat make you forget you've put some\nmusic on at all. It's long and quiet, but\npicks up eventually and gradually builds\nup into The Golden Hum, which has a nice lead guitar piece and a catchy cho-rus. The album continues with the same\nvibrant feeling, changing the pace, slipping off into melodic moments of harm o ny, and then coming back with choruses\nthat have you singing along and playing\nair guitar.\nWith more than the occasional reference to Travis and Semisonic, this album\nmay not be particularly novel, but it's a good listen nonetheless.\nI instantly recognise track six as the\ntheme from the TV series Smallville - a song that I like at the moment, but will\nbegin to hate with venom as soon as it's overplayed. Later songs include I'm Not\nAfraid, which will feature in the next\nseries of Dawson's Creek, and the faster,\nmore upbeat Impossibility. There is a hidden track too, but it's nothing special.\nHaving noticed a web address on the\nalbum sampler, I discovered that Remy\nZero were hand-picked by Radiohead to\nopen their latter OK Computer shows,\nand that they've toured with Semisonic\nand Travis (which had no effect on their\nmusical style whatsoever of course).\nOverall, a good third album, and I expect to hear a lot more from Remy Zero\nin the future.\nWhat exactly is \"acid jazz\"? I guess it\nmeans, roughly, music that is a bit like\njazz in the sense that it may contain\nsome improvisation and use similar\ninstruments, but has a steadier, rockier\nbeat and is intended to be dance able. There's nothing wrong with having jazz\nrecords that you can dance to, but much\nof what is labelled \"acid jazz\" can often\nbe bland and uninteresting.\nSo it is with several of the tracks on\nthis compilation, all of which feature the\nHammond organ. Personally, I'm a fan of\nthe Hammond, but it is an instrument\ncapable of producing both a cool, exciting sound and a very corny sound.\nUnfortunately, much of this record falls\ninto the latter category.\nNearly all of the tracks are very recent,\nwith a couple of oldies thrown in courtesy of Reuben Wilson and Jimmy\nMcGriff. These seem to stand out above\nthe dross, particularly Wilson's track,\nwhich is much more \"straight-ahead\"\nthan the rest of the bunch. Of the newer\ntracks, the Sugarman Three effort stands\nout for its simplicity: a solid groove and\nmessy organ over a repeated sax riff and\nsampled bar crowd sounds. The James\nTaylor track also chugs away at a fairly\nrocky pace. Unfortunately, that's about it\n- the rest of the tracks tend to lack any\nreal substance or groove.\nThe truth is that there is a lot of great\nHammond-based music out there, in\nmany different styles. Potential\nHammond fans would perhaps be better\nspending their hard-earned loan on the\nmusic of Jimmy Smith, Michael Brecker\nor Medeski, Martin and Wood.\nDerek ID Toby B Russ\n\n"

    "content": "union talk\nViva El Presidente!\nThe Union is listening\nFollowing a lot of comments about the\nUnion services, I hosted an open meeting\nlast week to look at entertainments provided by the Union and how we can\nimprove things. It proved very useful in\ngetting, first hand, some of the views of\nstudents using the Union and I thought I would share some of them here.\nOne of the key themes that came from\nthe meeting is the desire for more Cheese.\nAlthough I am not a great lover of cheese it\nseems that is what students want. There\nalso appears to be confusion between the\ndifferent nights at the Union. Students did\nnot know what was happening. There was\na strong call for a singularly themed Friday\nand Wednesday nights. This would mean\nthat there would be the same basic format\nfor all Wednesday and Friday evenings.\nThis would allow more specialist nights\nsuch as School Disco or band nights to\nhappen on a monthly basis. This would\nalso allow the union to target more\nresources towards these specialist nights.\nAnother key topic that was brought up\nwas bar promotions. There was a desire to\nhave more offers at the bar on a greater\nvariety of drinks. The Union has a limited\nnumber of drink promotions, the \u00a3la pint\non Wednesday night being the most pop u lar. There were suggestions to extend it to\nhave a happy hour or promotions on selected lines of beer and \"alcopops\".\nMost people seemed happy with the\nprices the Union charges for entry. We are\nafter all one of the cheapest Unions in\nLondon and some even suggested increasing it to allow for more bar promotions and\nspecialised nights.\nIf you agree or disagree with any of this,\nor have any other views or suggestions,\nplease email feedback@ic.ac.uk. So what\nis the next step? The Union will take these\nrecommendations and hope to have things\nin place soon. Following its success, I plan\nto expand these open meetings and apply\nit to other areas of the Union.\nThis is the start of a wider process to\nensure that the Union starts listening to its\nmembers and delivers the services they\nwant. Shortly we hope to have online\nanonymous feedback forms. There will\nalso be a series of market research initiatives and development of a strategy to\nensure that we continue to meet the needs\nof our members.\nSen Ganesh\nEditorial Rantings\nI found this picture, and I look so cheeky, I thought I'd give myself an editorial just so\nI can publish pictures of my own mug.\nArrogant, you might say, and you could be\nright. But that's not what I brought you\nhere to talk about. Well it was, actually, but\nI 've already run out of steam on that sub-j ect, so I 'll move onto another.\nWhat is going on in the Union? Is it just\nme, or has the entire thing just degenerated into a bitch-slapping, bodice-ripping,\nmud-wrestling, ego-wank-fest?\nI think that was the best sentence ever\nwritten.\nLet's look at the evidence. Elections. Oh\ndear. They go all wrong, and from what I can gather, instead of anyone really caring,\nthere seems to be two camps. Those who\ndon't think it was really that bad, and\nthose who want to bitch-slap David\nFrancis, who was the returning officer. I fully agree that it was all done rather hap-hazard ly, but the main aim seems now not\nto make sure it doesn't happen again, but\njust to publicly humiliate David. I can\nunderstand that desire, because he can be\nquite an arse (sorry David), but surely the\nplan should be to make the Union a better\nplace, and better run.\nMaybe I'm being a bit naive. After all, do\nyou see me running for President to sort it\nall out? No, because I'm not an utter, and I don't want to have to go through all this\ntype of shit myself, but I think there is\nsomething wrong with the system if people use the power given to them by you\n(apparently, but from the inside you see it's quite an ep otis tic regime) just to take out\npersonal grudges. Now maybe I'm being a cynic. It is certainly possible that some\npeople truly believe that the election was\nundemocratic, but if we re-run these elections, no-one will vote. Everyone knows\nthis. We have enough trouble with voting\nin the first place. So we re-run the elections, and only one department votes,\nbecause the rest of College is so disillusioned by the whole farce that they reckon\nwhat's the point. And I'm inclined to\nagree, because I am guilty of abusing that\nsystem myself. I certainly had an unfair\nadvantage this year, because through my\njob I have met the 'movers and shakers' of\nthe Union, who are the people who then\n'advise' their friends, and their friends,\nhow to vote. My point?\nDemocracy my big fat arse, frankly.\nwill\n\n"

After about twenty\nminutes of sustained pressure,\nthe IC centre-forward was\nadjudged to have been\nbrought down in the box.\nThere were no celebrations\nyet however as IC fifths had\nmissed every penalty this sea-son. Despite this JP stepped\nup and slotted the ball home\ncoolly in true manatee fashion.\nThis made for a tense last\ntwenty minutes as the S.O.P boys were in desperate need\nof points to fight off relegation\nworries. Despite some stiff\ndefending by IC, SOP scored\nwhen the number 11 pounced\non a defensive error.\nThe game ended 2-2 and\nunfortunately, the retiring\nboys didn't get the send off\nthat their years of dedication\ndeserved.\nIC I2814 LSE\nWith Slaps and Sooz missing,\nand Jess injured, it could have\ngone all wrong for our last\ngame, but we proved tri-um phant! We won the first\nquarter 9-3. With Jess suffer-ing, we brought her off and\nsaved her for the last quarter,\nin case it all went horribly\nwrong.\nIt did, however, go worse\nthan that, showing what a star player Jess is! We are too\nused to the beautiful flow in\ncentre court with her there!\n(Plus me at Centre - well that's really far too much effort - oh\ngo on then, I 'll use the excuse\nI 've had 2 concerts in the last\n2 nights). Back came Jess for\nthe 3rd quarter with the\nscores now 15-10. Supporters\narrived - Hannah returned to\nthe sidelines - and we pulled\nit back to 23-12. LSE would\nhave to do something amazing to win now with one more\nquarter to go. Ruthybaby\nreturned to Wing Attack and\nwhilst everyone was tiring,\nwe made some great interceptions and made the final push\nfor victory. We won overall 28\ngoals to 14. Amazing shooting\nby the legends that are Beckie\nand 2nd team captain Jenny!\nWe should finish 5th in the\nPremier League of ULU; we\njust escaped relegation last\nseason so this is brilliant stuff!\nAnother season over, and\nthat's it for the Dream Team as\nwe know it. Bring on June\nwhen we hit the shores of\nBarbados for our first ever\ntour....\nSki and Snowboard-a cio ius! While most of you were probably doing your last minute\nChristmas Shopping, 83\nImperial students joined 1000\nother students, in the resort of\nVal Thorens for a week of skiing and boarding at the BUSC\nThird Event.\nTo celebrate our first night\nin resort, a70's Porn Star\ntheme night was held at one of\nthe local clubs. Our President,\nBen, set the standards for the\nnight by demonstrating that\nmascara was not just for eyelashes - it could be used on\nyour chest hair too! Race\nCaptain, Ned followed suit\nand was soon seen sporting a hockey skirt, a fluffy yellow\ntop, and rather fetching improvised breasts. Sadly, no one\ninformed the pair that the\nlargest gay event in the Alps\nthat season was being held at\nthe same venue, on the same\nnight, and consequently they\nwere baffled by the amount of\nattention they received.\nAfter two days of fantastic\nskiing and boarding, it was\ntime for the 'Three Valley Rally'\nwhere rudi ty, crudity, and\nnudity won prizes. At various\ncheckpoints along the course,\nteams had to do anything they\ncould think of that they\nthought might earn them\npoints. Imperial teams\nmooned, skied topless, did a naked YMCA, and apple\nbobbed in rum in their attempt\nto win. One of our group was\neven heard to cry \"But it\nlooked like a woman from a distance\" after s noggin ga rather large German man.\nOn Wednesday night, to\nkeep up the ski club tradition,\nwe held one of our notorious\nfondue nights. After a full days\nskiing, we met at a restaurant\nat the top of a mountain to\nstart drinking. Five hours later,\nhaving eaten enough fondue\nto last a lifetime, and having\ndrunk enough to keep Oliver\nReed the wrong side of sober\nfor several years, we began\nour torch lit descent back\ndown into resort. Fortunately,\nthere were plenty of BUSC\nreps on hand to take the most\nincapacitated punters home\nby snowmobile. Others insisted that they could make it\nback safely, only to be later\nfound fast asleep halfway\ndown the p iste. Most recovered in time to be able to\nappreciate the next evening's entertainment - a School\nDisco.\nRaces were held in resort on\nour last day. The morning was\nan opportunity for anyone\ninterested in taking part and\nseeing what a slalom course\nwas really like from up close.\nThis was open to boarders and\nskiers of any ability and race\ntraining was on hand too. In\nthe afternoon, we competed in\nteams against other universi-ties. Unfortunately our A team\nand the boarder team were\nknocked out in the first round,\nbut the B team kicked ass and\nmade it to the finals where we\nwere finally beaten by Bristol.\nTo celebrate, we took the last\nlift up to the top of the mountain where we enjoyed a few\nGluvein, before skiing or\nboarding back to resort.\nAs it was our last night, we\nmade sure that it would be a good one and partied in true\nski club style, until eventually,\none by one, we dropped from\neither sheer exhaustion or\nalcohol poisoning and headed\nto bed for a couple of hours of\nmuch needed kip.\n\n"

We\nchose to travel by bus, which\nturned out to be the only bad\ndecision made all weekend, on\nand off the court.\nAs most people can probably imagine basketball players\ntend to be on the tall side and\nso cramming their 6 ft plus\nframes into the less than generous 1ft of leg space proved\ninteresting, but despite this\nwe all survived the trip to\nLeiden, after a brief stopover\nin Amsterdam for some recreational activities in the early\nevening. We registered our\nteam, which consisted of two\nladies, two 1st teams players\nand two 2nd team players.\nAfter registering and getting\nour free T shirt the games got\ngoing pretty much immediate-ly-Altogether around 36 teams\nfrom all over Europe participated in the event. The tournament itself was mixed and\nas a result was adapted to\nsuit. New rules enforced\nincluded two girls on court at\nall times, guys weren't allowed to block girls, the\nladies score three per basket\nto a guys two and, dare I say\nit, NO DUNKING.\nAll the teams where divided\ninto groups of between 5 and 6\nand the top three teams in\nthese groups were then\nselected for the next group\nstage. The losers we separated into groups of their own\nand got to battle it out for 36th Iced Gems\nIC Devils 4...2 London Legions\nThe IC Devils chalked up\ntheir second successive win in this tense derby match. A solid team performance combined with an outstanding\ngoal keeping display from\nman-of -the-match Adrian Gill, ensured a memorable\nvictory. Under the leadership\nof Dan, with David's captaincy and Terry's tactical knowl-edge, the Devils produced a memorable performance\nbelying their relative in experience. Max and Squashi\nopened the scoring in the\nfirst period, before the\nLegions finally put one past\nthe seemingly unbeatable\nAdrian. The score remained\n2-1 to the Devils at the end of\nthe first. Under heavy-pre s sure, the calming influence\nof Alex and Darren combined\nwith unorthodox defending\nby 'C. Penguin1\nand Kamal\nensured that the Legions\nwould not score early in the\nsecond. A Devils breakaway\nrounded-off by Max increased the lead back to a two-goal margin. Late in the\nsecond, the Legions hit back\nto make the scores 3-2 going\ninto the final period. The\nLegions pressed for an\nequalise r, but they were\nonce again denied by a series of superb saves by the\nDevils goaltender. The silky\nskills of Vince and Dmitry\ncombined with the presence\nof Thierry and Andy ensured\nthat the Devils would not\nfold. The pressure finally\nrelented after Tom scored\nwith a well-taken chance.\nThe score remained 4-2, and\nthe Devils had beaten the\nLegions.\nplace... yeah!\nDespite losing the first\ngame by a point our team was\nin good spirits, some more\nthan others, and we began to\nnotice that some of the other\nsides we borrowing players.\nWhile our girls suffered and\nwe lost another couple of\ngames, this time by slightly\nlarger margins, we began to\ncotton on and recruited some\nrather nice French ladies. This\ngave our girls a good rest and\nalso improved our results sub-st anti ally. One of the outstanding\naspects of the tournament\nwas the ability of the ladies.\nSome of the European girls\nhad serious skills and one had\nsuch a hot handle (good ball\nhandler) that she basically\nwalked through the opp osi tion.

    "content": "film reviews\nMonty Python & the Holy Grail 24 Hour Party People\nDVD release 4th March released 5th April 2002\nWe Were Soldiers is the latest Vietninterpretation from the man\nwho wrote screenplay for the likes of the historically inaccurate\nBraveheart (1995) and the award-winning Pearl Harbour (2001).\nRandall Wallace directs the story of one of the most savage battles mU.S. history, when 400 brave Americans were surrounded by 2,037 North Vietnamese soldiers. They fought for freedom,\nand to free the free world... This is just silly.\nThe wise King Arthur and his most trustworthy servant Patsy\nset out on a quest ordained upon them by almighty God to find\nthe exultant Holy Grail. And so forth on their way they join\nforces with Sir Lancelot \"The Brave\", Sir Robin \"The Not-QuiteSo-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot\", Sir Galahad \"The Pure\", Sir Gawain,\nand Sir Bedevere. Their adventures are chronicled in legendary\nMonty Python And The Holy Grail (1975).\nThese were the days when British comedy was funny and\nMonty Python ruled the Earth. Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John\nCleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, and Graham Chapman, were\nthe funniest people on the planet. They went on to make The\nLife Of Brian (1979), but their greatest achievement has to be\nthe movie they made on a shoestring budget of \u00a3150,000. Most\nof their other work often seems to Palin comparison.\nThe DVD is a must for all fans and non-fans. In fact, every-body. There is no perceivable reason for not buying this, except\nif you have no sense of humour, no DVD player, or if you think\nthat DVDs are too expensive - which is why I'm not buying it.\nBut I'm getting my mate, Recho, to thief it from Budget Records,\nCamden High Street.\nThe extras feature a fifty-minute documentary where Terry\nJones and Michael Palin go back to Holy Grail set location and\nnostalgia s is e, or perhaps more accurately, reminisce about the\nmaking of the movie. There's also a short Monty Python in Lego\nanimation made by a couple of geeks. There are subtitles in\nEnglish, French, German, Spanish, and for Those-Who-Don't Like The-Film. Animated menus. An18 minute behind-the-scenes report by the BBC from 1974. And Loads of other funny\nstuff. All adding up to make an terrific DVD package.\nManchester 1976. Tony Wilson, the future co-founder of factory\nrecords, owner of the notorious Hacienda nightclub, and\nGranada TV presenter, is attending an early Sex Pistols gig.\nThere are no more than 42 people attending an event that\nchanges the course of British music forever. Sitting at the front\nin the audience, Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook, soon to\nbecome Warsaw, then Joy Division, and finally New Order. The\nquiet little ginger-nut in the corner, that's Mick Hucknall. And there's a stretford school kid, Morissey.\nThese are the opening scenes of a movie that tells the story of\nthe biggest pop culture explosions in recent music history.\nMovements which owe a great deal to the creative vibrancy and\nenergy of Manchester. We have in this movie the birth of Punk,\nthe explosion onto the scene of rave-culture, and the history of\nthe legendary Hacienda nightclub.\n24 Hour Party People is told from the perspective of the aforementioned Tony Wilson, who was there throughout. He is\nplayed brilliantly and at times hilariously by the best character-comedian in the world, Steve Coogan. Forget The Parole Officer,\nthis is Coogan's element. There's a memorable scene where\nTony Wilson is presenting a second-rate Granada TV feature\nabout canals, which is just pure Tm Alan Partridge.\nThe director, Michael Winterbottom, maker of the Palm D 'Or\nnominated Welcome To Sarajevo (1997), chose to shoot the\nmovie entirely on hand-held DV camera. But his main achieve\u2022 ment has been to bring to life larger-than-life characters like the\nHappy Monday's Ryder brothers, Bez, Ian Curtis, and Martin\nHannet. Characters who contributed to the music that tried to\nturn the rest of the world into Mad-chester.\nCoogan's performance is just one of the highlights of a movie\nwhich impresses in almost every department. It is funny, at\ntimes touching, informative, and very entertaining. The only\ndrawback being the music scenes, which will tend to gravitate\nto fans of the music as opposed to your average viewer. Setting\nthat aside, 24 hour party people is a very ambitious film which\nin the end succeeds.\nDarius\n\n"

If you\nhave ever tried to enter information on these forms (a task\nin itself, as I had to email the\nadministrator twice regarding\na non-working password),\nyou'll find that it takes easily\nas long as the paper version.\nThis is partly to do with the\nfiddly ness of the bloomin' buttons - but mostly caused by\nthe torrent of abuse I felt compelled to write at the end, in\nthe 'comments' box. While\nthis was obviously optional, I just had to do it as the first\npart was so tricky.\nTo add to this, was the fact\nthat I had 15 of the bloody\nthings to fill in. I gave up after\nsix. A better system must be\nobtained, that is agreed, but\ncan we have one that doesn't take up nine tenths of our free\ntime.

I suggest in\nfuture you should confirm your\nsources more rigorously as the\narticle was littered with factual inaccuracies.\nYour readers may be interested to learn that the formal\ncomplaint, which I made in\nresponse to many grievances\nexpressed by the students I represent, was in fact sent to\nthe returning officer by email\nas required, before the count\ncommenced on Saturday\nmorning. Sellotape was not\ninvolved at any time. Nor was\nBlu-Tac, chewing gum, staples\nor any other adhesive.\nMy sole argument is with the\nprocedure of the election,\nmainly proxy voting, and the\ndifficulties this created for\nthose wanting to vote. These\ninclude medical students,\nwhose interests are my\nresponsibility. Mr Francis was\nnot implicitly criticised in my\ncomplaint, nor was that conclusion intended to be drawn\nfrom the statement I put for-ward. The sc ep tics among you\nmay believe that my complaint\nwas \"sour grapes\" on behalf of\nIdris Harding, who happens to\nbe a medical student. This is\nsimply not the case. I am voicing the complaints of a number of students who felt disenfranchised during the voting\nprocedure.\nThe tone of the article suggests that the re-running the\nelection will be an extravagant waste of money that\ncould be used for student\nactivities. Ensuring democracy at Imperial is money well\nspent, even if it costs more\nthan a set of rugby jerseys.\nYours,\nShazia (ICSM SU President)\nPS - Where did you get that\nawful photo?!\nYou imply that a single, trivial\ninaccuracy renders the article\n'littered' with lies. It seems the\nonly fact you dispute regards\nhow your complaint was de liv ered. We certainly don't like to\nget our facts wrong, so we\nhave apologised on Page 2.\nWe did not, in fact, say that\nyou had submitted your complaint due to \"sour grapes\".\nHowever, it is important to\npoint out that at least ten\nmembers of Council (excluding\nsabbaticals, of course) said\nthat they believe this to be the\ncase and it was these allegations that were reported.\nYou did implicitly criticise Mr\nFrancis in your complaint. You\nquestioned the actions of the\nReturning Officer (Mr Francis)\nand those of the Election\nCommittee (chaired by Mr\nFrancis). You also questioned\nwhether or not the election\nwas run properly (an election\nrun by Mr Francis), though\nadmittedly stopped short of\nquestioning his adherence to\nthe constitution.\nIn answer to your final ques-tion, we got that awful photo\nfrom our photo archives. It is\nlocked in a cupboard in a base-ment, so quite some explosive\ncharge will be required before\nwe're rendered unable to reuse it. We thought the hat\nrather suited you \u00a9 AW\nGarden Hall\nDear Felix,\nFirstly following the letter\nfrom the Garden residents last\nweek, I took up their kind offer\nto tour Garden Hall and I must\nsay it very nice indeed. It is\nclear why the residents are\nvery proud of the hall.\nI want to address the key\nissues relating to the proposed\nsale of Garden Hall and what\nthe Union has been doing in\ngeneral with respect to\naccommodation.\nThe Union has worked with\nresidences to undertake a comprehensive price review of\nhalls and the recommend a talk back\nt ions will be taken to the\nRector. In the review, the\nUnion has been successful in\nensuring price cuts for\nLinstead, Weeks and\nSouthside. In total over third of\nrooms will have a price cut\nnext year.\nIt is clear that there has been\nunder-investment in halls of\nresidence over the last few\nyears and the Union has\nworked with College to ensure\nthat the refurbishment of Halls\nis made top priority. We have\ncommitment from the Rector\nthat Southside refurbishment\nwill commence next year.\nUnfortunately as an asset\nGarden Hall (with a total of 82\nresidences) is worth a lot of\nmoney (over \u00a310M) and given\nthe current financial position\nof College it is necessary to\n\"sweat\" our assets to improve\nservices for all. This money\nwill be used to pay for development and refurbishment of\nSouthside which will benefit\nmore than 350 students.\nThere are no easy choices.\nUltimately I believe in the long\nrun we will have facilities to\nmatch some of the best institutions in the world. The\nUnion believes that we must\nhave good quality affordable\naccommodation that is easily\naccessible to College, but it\nwill take time. There have\nbeen too many short term\nfixes and it is time to engage a long-term strategy that will\nbenefit all students.\nSen Ganesh, President\nImperial College Union\nEast Meets West\nDear Felix,\nFollowing a letter about the\nEast Meets West show, I thought it would be appropriate to reply.

The weekend got off to a rocky start as the England\nRugby team got pounded by\nthe French, but this did nothing dampen the already high\nspirits of the IC club.\nWith the promise of booze,\nthe brunel team arrived bushy\neyed and bright tailed, also\nhoping to whip some french\narse.\nThere were some very\nimpressive swims, especially\nfrom Julio Georgiou who\nstormed to an amazing and\nunprecedented double whammy in the 50m and 100m breast stroke. Good times\nwere also posted by Jon Page,\nJon Robinson, Chris\nHaselwandter and Alex\nChklar.\nUnfortunately, due to the\ndistinct lack of anything\nvaguely female at IC, we had\nto beg and steal from the elite\nULU squad to make up the\nrest of the numbers, and they\nhelped take the IC team (58\npoints )to aston king victory\nover both the french (28\npoints) and the team from\nBrunei (33 points).\nIn the near future, a crack\nsquad of swimmers will be\ntravelling over to fra rice to\nwhip some more french bot ty and get copiously drunk...\nmore results will follow, plus\nthe obligatory victory march\nthrough the streets of london!\nAlexander\nReserve Cup Final\nIC II 1 2LSE II (a et) After a storming into the Cup\nFinal with style and panache,\nand scoring goals for fun along\nthe way, the mighty seconds\nsmelt success and glory. We\narrived at Motspur Park confident of bringing the Cup back\nto IC, and in the words of\nSardines himself we were\ndetermined to do the right\nthings, at the right times, in\nthe right places.\nStepping out onto the pitch\nin the face of a force 10 wind\nproved slightly difficult. We\nbattled like tigers out of\ndefence and managed to put\ntogether a couple of decent\nbreaks and almost got an early\nreward but were unlucky\ninside the box, but this was to\nbe our only clear cut chance of\nthe half.\nAfter twenty minutes the\nball bobbled inside the box\nfrom a debatable LSEcorner,\nand an economics muppet fortuitously stuck it in. At 1-0\ndown we kept battling but\ncouldn't produce the football\nthat has brought us so much\nsuccess and Sardines was not\na happy bunny at half-time. In\npatches the magic returned to\nour boots in the second half\nand we started to knock the\nball around with some noteworthy aggression and skill,\nshown by Bassies from left\nback and pint-necking maestro Jon Don in the centre. A break down the right flank\nfrom Magic left the ball at\nCartwright's feet, and a beautiful long ball into the channel\nfound Baskett up front.\nDespite the LSE defenders'\nattempts to find out what\nunderwear Brad was wearing,\nBaskett outstripped him and\nequalise d superbly. With the\nscores level and the phenomenal IC support behind us the\ntigers roared on to better football and were unfortunate not\nto get a winner, especially\nhaving found greater success\ndown our right flank and more\npenetration all over the pitch.\nBaskett was again released\none on one with the keeper\nand an excellent effort into the\nbottom corner was harshly\nruled out for offside. In extra\ntime IC again dominated our\nmuch weaker opponents but\nafter the first period we were\nstill dead-locked, and at this\nstage LSE introduced a recently released ex-con up front\nwho tried to intimidate\nCartwright and Jon Don with\na series of head butts, all of\nwhich the ageing referee and\nsuspiciously young linesman\nfailed to notice. With only ten\nminutes of the game left to go\nand IC minds possibly on the\npenalties we had been practising the last two weeks, LSE\ngrabbed a winner. It was more\nthan they deserved and\ndespite our sterling efforts\nthey held on for victory in a match that never quite got\ngoing for us. So despite all the\npre-match hype, expectation\nand preparation, it was not\nmeant to be, and the cup will\nnot be in South Kensington\nthis year, but the mighty seconds roar on and will doubtless be there or thereabouts\nthis time next year. Boost.\n\n"

    "content": "spring LEQ\nLEQs - The Spring Edition\nWhat is the Spring Term LEQ?\nThis is the opportunity for undergraduates to evaluate the lecturers who taught\nthem during the past term by completing\na web based questionnaire on each\ncourse attended.\nWhen is the Spring Term LE Q open?\nFrom the 18 March 2002 to 31 March 200\nWhat password do students use to\naccess the LE Q web site?\nFor the Autumn term LEQ, an individual\npassword was emailed to each student.\nThis was a temporary but unsatisfactory\nexpedient and for this term's LEQ, the\npassword will be the student's CID num-ber. The next update of the ORACLE software which underpins the LE Q will permit a student's normal College password\nto be used but the software will not be\ninstalled in time for this term's survey. It\nwill be ready for the survey due in the\nautumn term 2002.\nNote that students can change their\npassword from their CID number to one of\ntheir choosing once they have logged on.\nWhat about the other problems with last electronic LEQ?\nThose problems reported to the LE Q project team involved students forgetting or\nlosing their passwords, finding no courses to evaluate or having access problems\nto the site itself. Virtually all the problems\nreported were rapidly solved.\nThere are also three students, as I type,\nattacking the system; giving constructive\nfeedback.\nIs the LE Q site accessible from any-where?\nThe site is not currently accessible from\noutside the College but should be accessible from anywhere within the College\nincluding other campuses and most halls\nof residence. Unfortunately, it is not\naccessible from PCs which have the\nKonqueror browser tho jig ht to be particularly popular in the Computing\nDepartment.\nWhy should students complete the\nLEQ?\nThis is an important opportunity for students to make their voice heard and tell\nthe Departments how good their good\nlecturers are and how bad their bad lecturers are. The more students complete\nthe LE Q the more Departments take\nnotice. Departments do actually welcome\nconstructive feedback and encourage students to provide this. The student participation rate across the College for the\nautumn term was a disappointing 20%\noverall though some Departments managed 30 + %. However some Departments\nwere as low as 9% and both the USC and\nICU wish to encourage students to dramatically improve this participation rate.\nDepartments will take more notice of stu-dent's comments in this survey, the\ngreater the number of participants.\nAre the results anonymous?\nYes, only statistical results are released to\nDirectors of Undergraduate Studies and\nDepartmental Student Representatives,\nwho will have no idea which students\nhave responded.\nWhat about the free form textual\ncomments that students can add to\neach LEQ?\nThese also remain anonymous and are\nreleased, collated in an ony mise d form\nand linked to the relevant lecturer, to\nDirectors of Undergraduate Studies and\nDep reps with the statistical results.\nWhy not use paper?\nPaper based LE Q are labour intensive,\nenvironmentally unfriendly, completed\nonly by those present at the lecture when\ndistributed and can pass through several\nhands before the results are publicised.\nThe USC and ICU have determined that\nelectronic LEQ's are the way forward as\nthey have the following advantages over\npaper e \u2022 All students have the opportunity to\nrespond not just those that happen to\nbe attending the particular lecture\nwhen a paper-based LE Q is offered.\n\u2022 Students have sufficient time to contribute constructive textual comments.\n\u2022 Less work required by the\nDepartmental and College staff.\n\u2022 No involvement of academic staff from a student's home department in the\nprocess therefore greater anonymity for\nstudent.\n\u2022 Quick turn-around of the responses\nthus enabling prompt action by\nDepartments if necessary.\n\u2022 Quick and accurate turn-around of the\ntextual comments made by students.\n\u2022 Excellent flexibility: once established it\nwill be possible to customise the questions and arrange for the survey to be\ncarried out at a convenient time for any\nsection of the College.\nAre the LE Q questions old fashioned?\nSome of the questions are old fashioned\nand this is the last survey in which the\nquestions will be used in the current for-mat. A USC working party will be reviewing and revising the questions for future\nincarnations.\nWhen will the results be available?\nThe results are released simultaneously\nto DUG's and Dep reps shortly after the\nclosure of the survey period.\nIs there an incentive for participating?\nThere are 10 prizes of \u00a325.00 each for students who participate in the LE Q and\nwho opt to be included in the prize draw.\nIndividual Departments may also provide\nlocal incentives.\nAre there any changes to the LE Q since the autumn term?\nThere have been some cosmetic changes\nresponding to student comments and the\nsystem has been road tested by a few student volunteers.\nWho is eligible to complete the LEQ?\nAll undergraduates except those in the\nSchool of Medicine. We hope to extend\nthe survey to include medical students by\nthe autumn.\n\n"

(Page 22)\nThe new and improved\nSpring LEQs are here.\nSort of like a Union\ncat food. (Page 4) LEQS\nImperial Students Reject NUS\nThe students of Imperial College have\noverwhelmingly voted to remain outside\nthe National Union of Students.\nThe referendum enjoyed a large turnout\nof over 28% of Imperial's student pop ul a tion, and almost three times that usually\nseen for the election of Imperial's Union\nPresident.\nThe final count took place on Saturday,\nwith 766 votes in favour of joining the\nNUS facing an enormous 1983 votes. The\nresult will be a blow to the NUS, which\nhad high hopes for obtaining Imperial\nCollege as a member.\nThe count looked set to be delayed after\nthe close of voting on Friday when David\nFrancis, head of the 'Yes' campaign, had\nrefused to sign the document declaring\nthat he thought the referendum had been\nfairly and constitutionally run. This ceremony occurs after every important Union\nelection and helps prevent unnecessary\nchallenges from candidates once the\nresults are announced.\nCounting could finally proceed at 3pm on Saturday once a new document had\nAnd they did...\nbeen prepared. The new version outlined\na number of problems that the 'Yes' campaign had found with the regulations governing Union elections, but these were\nnot intended as a formal complaint. They\nwere signed by the returning officer as\nwell as Mr Francis in addition to the standard agreement documents.\nWhile the result is the most significant\nrejection of NUS affiliation since 1956, this\nmay not be the last current students will\nsee of referenda on the issue. Mr Francis\nstated that the 'Yes' campaigners \"didn't expect to get it first time,\" and that this\nyear's campaign had provided \"sign if i cant momentum\" for Imperial's association with the NUS. It is conceivable that\nCouncil may order a second referendum\nas early as next year, assuming support\nexists.\nThe original decision to run an NUS referendum attracted significant opposition\nat the Council meeting which ordered it.\nMany of the referendum's primary opponents ended up working for the 'No' cam-pa ign, with the notable exception of\nUnion President and nascent College\ncelebrity Sen Ganesh, who supported the\n'No' vote but originally proposed that the\nballot should take place.\nThe high turn-out in this vote indicates\nthat Imperial students may finally have\nfound a political debate to get their teeth\ninto. Certainly, greater student involvement in Union issues would be widely\nwelcomed by all those involved.\nAlisdair\n\"How pedestrian!\" screamed one\nreviewer, as the team began to get very\nhigh on sugar.

    "content": "club active\nIC 6th s Win the Cup\nICUAFC 6th XI 2...0 UCL6 th XI\nThis was it, the Cup Final.\nMotspur Park was the venue\non a blustery but clear day,\nwith conditions difficult for\nboth teams.\nOur preparations for this\ngame had begun the previous\nnight, with Sugo's setting the\nscene for a team dinner, followed that morning with an\ninspiring team talk from coach\nColin. We took to the field\nknowing our duty, what had to\nbe done.\nThe game kicked off, both\nsides fighting hard in what\nwas for many, the biggest\ngame of their careers. Initial\nexchanges were easily dealt\nwith, nervousness evident in\nthe passing of both sides.\nThen, from nothing, Jermyn\nbroke clear of their sluggish\nback line on the left, and one-on-one with the keeper he finished superbly in the bottom\nright corner. IC had to withstand the inevitable onslaught\nand did so magnificently, with\nthe offside trap working really\nwell with crucial tackles\nmade.\nA couple of \"accidental\"\nkicks here and there to break\nup the opposition's passing\nwere well received by the\nvocal crowd, who spurred us\non with classic singing and\nsome proper abuse (kw ali ty lads), though not by the ref.\nwho booked Wilson for a nice\nsly hack.\nWith half an hour gone, a succession of throw-ins on the\nright gave the ball to Hine\nwho, weaving his way\nthrough a group of players,\nwas crudely tripped 25 yards\nout. It was a cynical challenge,\nbut the free kick was ideally\nsuited for a Warzee special,\nand the big Belgian stepped\nup and duly delivered a spectacular goal, into the top left\ncorner. Now to keep a grip on\nthe game, no silly mistakes.\nThe UCL captain, obviously\nannoyed at his team's per-form ance, suddenly exploded\nto comments from the IC\ncrowd and attempted to headbutt a supporter. He received\na yellow card when many felt\nhe warranted more, disgrace-ful.\nWith UCL throwing men forward after half time, we coped\nwell under pressure. Head and\nNikolich in their final game for\nthe club were working well at\nthe back, with the midfield\nquartet battling and the strikers pushing up. A couple of\ncounter attacks were all IC\nhad to show for things,\nalthough good pressure by\nSmden and Quaranta gave us\na few chances.\nIn the final ten minutes,\nDrury usefully made an outstanding point blank save\nfrom a UCL set piece, as a goal\nthen could have been really\nproblematic.\nThe final whistle went without any further scares and\ncaptain Coker lifted the Cup\nfor the first time in 6th team\nhistory. An excellent end to\nthe season, by what was definitely a cup team, with irreverent form in the league, that\ncould always pull it out of the\nbag for the big occasion.\nThe main objective of the\nseason was achieved on\nMonday when our first team\npicked up a narrow and hard-fought but ultimately\ndeserved victory over King's to win the UL U challenge\nCup.\nSquash is actually played\nin teams of five, each player\nopposed to a corresponding\nranked player from the other\nteam. We started off really\nstrongly at number two with Jeff playing some awesome\nwidths to easily brush aside\nhis opponent to cruise to a magnificent 3-0 victory.\nIn the number five's game\nLazy crashed out 3-1,\ndespite some brilliant running and a massive effort.\nThis was the first game he\nhad lost all season and the\ndisappointment was clearly\nSquash\nvisible on his face.\nIn the third match of the\nday, Craig at number three\nstayed in total control of his\ncourt strode King's lethal\nweapon, a six foot seven inch\ngiant of a man, called Jorgen\nand originating from\ngame to demolish his opponent 3-0.\nUp next was the number\none's game, and onto the\nDenmark, who might as well\nhave been a rugby player: He\nwas truly massive. Despite a really good effort from Ali Nour best player - there really\nwas nothing that could be\ndone against this wizard\nwho was pulling out the\n\"nicks\" from nowhere, and so\nit was all down to the last\ngame.\nReddy at number four was\nup against a tough contestant and after four closely disputed games the scores were\nlevel at 2-2.\nOn the decisive last game,\na cool display of champagne\nsquash from Reddy secured\nthe final set and the match\noverall. Victory was finally\nours, the free beer tasted\ngood...\nThat puts an end to a really excellent season: 2nd in\nBUSA, 1st in our UL U league\nand this magnificent victory\nin the UL U challenge Cup:\nbring on next year!\n\n"

    "content": "talk felix\nInkwell: Tanaka's Gift\nInkwell is back (after a brief period in that\nbarren landscape known as \"catching up\nwith school work\") and my quill today\ntakes me to the very front gates of this fine\ninstitution where work has begun on the\nPrestigious New Entrance that Imperial\nCollege is soon to have.\nThe Exhibition Road entrance is now little more than a monstrous pile of brick,\nrubble and unsightly heavy-duty machinery. All part of the lovely 25 million pound\npackage from IC alumnus and millionaire\nphilanthropist Dr. Gary Tanaka.\nNow, on paper it all seems swell and\nhonky dory. Oh how wonderful, how very\nbenevolent of an Imperial alumni to spread\nthe seeds of his success on his academic\nroots. After all, with continuous threats\nfrom the higher education funding council\ntowards substantially cutting funding for\nUniversity Departments, an extra \u00a325million quid in the bank isn't that bad. Or is it?\nYou see naturally the question-O meter\nin my head has again risen to critical point\nand a few issues have continued to oscillate to and fro within the inner walls of the\nol' Nate Evuarherhe cranium.\nFirst Quesch: Does Imperial College really need a \"Prestigious New Entrance\"? In\nwhat way does a PNE facilitate the\nImperial College quest to gain global\nrecognition as a world-class institution?\nMy answer, none what so ever.\nThere exists a fine line between spending for a useful purpose and squandering\nmillions on what appears on the surface to\nbe a fine investment but is little more than\na display of sound and fury signifying\nnothing. After all, even the least perceptive of us will notice that there are numerous other areas of far greater importance\nthat are desperately in need of funding.\nEvery year for instance, hundreds of second year students (like my humble self) are\ndisgorged from the relative comfort of\nHalls of Residence into a city that empties\nthe old student coffer quicker than you can\nsay TANAKA! Would an investment\ntowards the provision of more halls of residence not serve a more useful purpose?\nThe planned refurbishment of South-side\nHalls, the re-construction of the Beit Halls,\nand the grand feature of architectural wizardry that is the Bio-medical Science building are all worthy of praise, for these have\nproved to be world class facilities that\nserve to enhance the IC position as a top\nflight institution both at home and abroad.\nAn entrance, on the other hand is sim-ply. .. an entrance. It's rather like a designer shirt. It's pretty. It's expensive. But what\ndoes it say about the true nature of the\nwearer's character? Nothing at all! A visitor to IC, or a passer-by might say, \"Oh\nwhat a prestigious new entrance they've\ngot\". But apart from that what purpose\ndoes it serve?\nIt won't make student life any less difficult than it already is. It won't improve the\nteaching quality of our lecturers. And it\ncertainly won't shoot Imperial College\nthree places up the league table. So why is\nthe exhibition road entrance looking the\nway it is now?\nIt seems to me to be another sad case of\nThe Golden Rule. i.e. He who has the gold\nmakes the rule!\nGary Tanaka's gift is appreciated and\nvery much welcome. I do however think all\nthe money could have been better spent\non something more important and less\nsuperficial that a Prestigious New\nEntrance.\nNate Evuarherhe\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nLIVE: Kosheen\n@ Pacha\nThis was quite simply unbelievable. Think of going to a gig at a five star hotel. Think of a fantastic band, playing ten tracks of\nthe finest live dance music you've heard in a long, long time.\nYou're not even close.\nPacha, located a mere stone's throw from Victoria tube sta-tion, is well worth a visit, although one suspects that it's usually fairly pricey if you don't have the luxury of a press pass. I really don't exaggerate when I compare it with a hotel - there were\nchandeliers, plants, leather sofas, wood panelling, and people\nwalking around with trays of wine glasses. We were even treated to some free food courtesy of Poseidon.\nKosheen, arriving on stage a mere half-hour late, were\nabsolutely superb, playing tracks from their debut album Resist\nand grabbing our attention from the off with (Slip & Slide)\nSuicide. Sian Evans' distinctive powerful vocals were complemented perfectly by guitar, bass, drums, keyboards and a guy\nplaying a sort of electronic 'cello.\nPlaying live, Kosheen manage to add extra energy and emotion to their music without losing the polished feel of the album.\nThe central theme was drum 'n' bass, of course, but the\nchanges in mood, style, rhythm and speed were more than\neffective.\nKosheen are now used to playing the big arenas, and so it\nwas a real privilege to be part of an audience of only around 200,\nespecially at such a classy venue. We stood right at the front,\nmaking eye contact with the performers, and the only real low\npoint was when the hour-long set came to its conclusion and\nthe band left the stage.\nB8 BSB Dave\nCOMPETITION WINNER\nThe winner of the Alicia Keys competition from Issue 1230 is\nthe gloriously named Anthony Jude Rodrigues of EEE 4.

The pounding central riff makes Used For Glue a genuinely adrenal ising track. Oh,\nand the chorus is bigger than the Earth - fact! Buy three copies.\nS BBBB Kunal\nSEAFOOD - Western Battle\nThis up-to-date rock song is another strong offering from\nSeafood. It has a more serious sound than their previous single,\nthe excellent Splinter, but it's not quite as good. That's not to\nsay it isn't catchy - some parts of the song are very memorable,\nespecially the chorus.\nRobin\nALFIE - A Word In Your Ear\nA smart and clever pop song. Quiet guitars, percussion and\nsweet vocals combine on this beautiful track which ends by\nadding several instruments (keyboards, strings, chorus) but\nstill staying under control. Definitely the best song they've ever\ndone. I look forward to the next album.\n09988 Frangois\nMO Q SHA Moksha The Destroyer vs Dubzilla\nMoqsha are four blok es out of college who like twiddling\nknobs and a girl who can just about hit the notes.

    "content": "music reviews\nBusta Rhymes\nGenesis\nOut now on J records\nLike almost all hip-hop albums these\ndays, with the honourable exception of\nJay-Z' s The Blueprint, this new release\nfrom Busta Rhymes is way too long. As this is pretty much endemic to the genre,\nI find it best to review each album as a compilation. On this level, you're free to\nsimply pick and choose between the\ntracks, and suddenly Genesis becomes\nmuch more admirable.\nThere's Dre's excellent Break Ya Neck,\nfeaturing a typically frenetic vocal from\nRhymes (\"Break ya fuckin' neck, bitch-es!\"), and Bounce (Let Me See Ya Throw\nIt) with some great stabbing strings and\na rumbling bass.\nThe Neptunes turn in a couple of excellent joints - As I Come Back sounds like\nBusta literally growling over the best\nbass-driven Neptunes production I 've\nheard in quite a while, and What It Is features Kelis on the last verse.\nThe title track is also worthy of a men-tion, with the kind of spare background\nusually associated with early RZA efforts. Then there's Shut 'Em Down\n2002, Pete Rock's reworking of the Public\nEnemy classic, which has Busta rapping\naway over the top. This track is Rhymes\nat his best, the stripped-down backing\ncontrasting with his larger than life per-son a. It's easy to judge an album like Genesis\nby its guest appearances, and to concentrate on the production over the supposed star of the show. Busta, with his\nsheer force of personality, manages to\navoid this, and the result is one of the\nbest rap albums of the last couple of\nyears.\nVex Red\nStart With A... Out now on Virgin records\n[The full title is Start With A Strong And\nPersistent Desire]\nVex Red are from Aldershot. That's not\nvery rock 'n' roll, is it? What is rock 'n' roll\nis the way they were signed - Ross\nRobinson (who produces Slipknot, Korn,\nAt The Drive-in and Amen) called the\nboys up one day while they were watching a video, and signed them after hearing one demo tape. Vex Red must be a bit\nspecial, then, as must Start With A Strong And Persistent Desire, the debut\nalbum from this delightfully charismatic\nand charming band.\nAt its best, this album is amazing.\nTracks which spring to mind as masterpieces include the recent single Can't Smile, with its gritty, low-pitched sampling and amazing guitar riff, and the\nslow, smooth Untitled.\nSadly, some of the other tracks on the\nalbum are found wanting. In particular,\nClone Jesus and The Closest sound\nstrangely empty, despite the fact that\nthey are both quite rocky, with heavy guitar riffs and drum beats.\nThat said, fans of Vex Red will be\npleased with this debut effort. The five\nhave sidestepped the temptation to simply make a collection of excellent tracks,\nand have chosen instead to make an\nalbum which flows well, like a piece of\npoetry or a good story.\nStart with a strong and persistent\ndesire? Vex Red certainly seem to have\ndone just that, and good luck to them.\nNot that they need it - how many other\nbands can you name that got signed and\ngot this far on the basis of one cheap\ndemo tape?\nBiffy Clyro\nBlackened Sky\nOut now on Beggars Banquet records\nThis Kilmarnock-based trio are going to\nbe very important - they not only take\nrock to places that rock hasn't been\nbefore, but they take it first class on Concorde, complete with champagne and\ncaviar and those little screens in the\nbacks of the seats.\nEvery single member of the band\nsings, meaning that there is no apparent\n\"front man\", but as all the boys seem to\nhave similar voices, this doesn't detract\nat all from the music.\nThe opening track is the pleasantly\nfunctional Joy. Discovery. Invention,\nwhich begins with a quiet twelve-note\nguitar riff and finishes with an all-out\nrocking chorus. Justboy and the rather\nbrilliantly titled Kill The Old, Torture\nTheir Young follow, both combining some\nof the best aspects of Muse and At The\nDrive-in.\nIt's hard to pick out the outstanding\ntracks on this CD, because there are so\nmany instantly memorable, completely\nsing able rock anthems. But Scary Mary\nis probably the best track, a sweet,\nmelancholy, heartfelt collection of\nthoughts about a broken relationship:\n\"You made patterns in my face, you\npainted pictures with my tears\".\nUnfortunately, there's a problem with\nthe album. The clean-cut sound of Biffy\nClyro is sometimes slightly masked with\nfeedback and other little nig gly sounds\nthat were blatantly added in post-pro-duct ion. Someone should find whoever\nproduced this and convince him to take\nup a new career as a Buddhist monk in\nTibet. Then maybe we can listen to Biffy\nClyro, perfect and un marred, in peace.\nToby G Jess Jess\n\n"

What is a Summer Ball?\nWell other than state the obvious (rumour\nhas it that Imperial contains intelligent\npeople!), it is an opportunity for over 1,500\nstudents to get together, dress up and\nhave a good time. This year's extravaganza will be the biggest ever held in college.\nSo when is it happening?\nOn June 8, the Imperial College grounds\nwill be transformed into a top class entertainment venue that will include an outdoor stage on the Queen's Lawn, as well\nas a fairground and a number of indoor\ndance arenas.\nBut before you all start emailing me\nIC Radio\nThe spirits of the deceased still linger\naround the operating table...\nThe pr act ici on ers at work.\nKave, whilst Zan Lyons and The Rock\nOf Travolta axe being bottled into\nvials for future treatments as we converse If any bands/units reading this\ncommunication are interested in fe a Summer Ball\ncomplaining that its smack bang in the\nmiddle of your exams this date has been\nchosen because it's the only time that\nthere are no exams on a Friday near the\nQueens Lawn.

    "content": "reviews film\n2001: A Space Odyssey\nat the Bfi I MAX\nThe Royal Tenenbaums\nreleased 15th March\nDon't read this expecting me to explain what it's is all about.\nBecause I haven'ta clue. Is it about the existence of an extra-ter-res trial creator? Is it about the ir re solvable conflict between science and religion? Or mankind's timeless aspiration to self-over-coming and the unattainable?\nAll you and I know is that anybody who claims to know what\nit's all about is a liar. Its genius is in that it is a question-provoking\nphilosophical trip into the pre-history and future of mankind.\nSome, perhaps, most people claim that it is utterly meaningless\nand like its maker, intellectually vain and pretentious. But I would\nsay otherwise. What it means is what you make of it, the meaning\nyou give to it. If you don't, then from the momentous start to the\nunfathomable finale, you will tell yourself that it is meaningless.\nThen there's2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Partly based on\nArthur C. Clarke's short story, The Sentinal. Co-written and directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. Arguably, the greatest movie of all-time, way ahead of its time, and without a shadow of a monolith,\na masterpiece.\nAs an audio-visual experience it set a landmark in the film\nindustry. It resonated in the era of psychedelic drugs, counter-cul-ture, and all-round confusion; and still continues to amaze our\ntwenty-first century audiences. Most of us have watched it on TV\nbut 2001 is one of those films you have to watch in the cinema to\nappreciate Kubrick's audio-visuals.\nEven though it is over thirty years old it looks more authentic\nthan most of today's sci-fi. Every penny of the \u00a36m budget was\nspent in giving the viewer an experience as close as possible to\nactually being in space. In every moment of 2001: A Space\nOdyssey you're sampling the wonder of the space age.\nThe best works of art are those which don't fill in the gaps in\nyour knowledge. They open up new arenas for thought. Give you\na different perspective. As I sat there, watching 2001: A Space\nOdyssey, I asked myself several questions: Will mankind ever find\na purpose? Is the answer out there in the vast expanse of the uni-verse? Will the local KFC still be open after this? If not, what about\nthe Kebab King? I'm quite hungry.\nStarring: Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Anjelica Huston, Luke Wil son, Gwyneth Paltrow, Danny Glover, and Bill Murray. Co-written and directed by Wes Anderson, who is most famous for the\nexcellent Rushmore (1998).\nRoyal Tenenbaum (Hackman) and his wife Etheline (Huston)\nhad three children, Chas (Stiller), Richie (Wilson), and Margot\n(Paltrow), all child prodigies. Chas was a real estate and finance\ngenius. Margot was an award-winning playwright. Richie was\na junior champion tennis player.\nTwo decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster subsequently\nerased all memory of the young Tenenbaums brilliance. Most of\nthis was generally considered to be their father's fault. The\nRoyal Tenenbaums is the story of the family's sudden, unexpected reunion one recent winter.\nIt is about success and failure, taking resp on sibi l ty for your\nlife, growing-up; all universal themes that will strike a chord\nwith everyone, partly explaining the film's popularity amongst\ncritics and audiences alike in the U.S.. Highly original and witty The Royal Tenebaums is guaranteed\nto be one of the better films this year.

    "content": "eggs easter\nAn intrepid team of taste-testers from the Felix editor al and reporting crew undertook to test twenty of the best-selling Easter\nEggs to help you decide which your loved-ones would receive this Easter. Taste, toys and packaging were scrutinised careful-ly, and the results are laid out below. It was a tough job, but somebody had to do it.\nGuylain \u2022\n\"The only thing I know that's worse dipped in beer\" said\none taster, the others complaining that the chocolate\nwas a bit dull - \"Uh! Uh! Yuk!\"\nwrote one. A box of chocolates was included, which one taster loved, and the others dismissed as \"vomit.\"\nSmarties \u2022\nA number of reviewers were\nunable to stop giggling at this\npoint as sugar overwhelmed\ntheir brains. The egg was\nnice, if a little bland, and the\ntubes of Smarties were good.\nWe got two letter 'N's on our\nlids. The foil on the egg was\nalso \"very pretty.\"\nMaltesers (Favourite)\nThe egg was distinguished\nby the presence of little honeycomb pieces embedded in\nthe shell. Wai e this was generally w<1ive d, one\nmember ,o ted thai it looked\nlike \"chocolate ac\u00bbe.\" Two\nbags of Maltesers completed\nthis favourite choice.\nCreme Egg\n\"How pedestrian!\" screamed\none reviewer, as the team\nbegan to get very high on\nsugar. \"Two Creme Eggs is\nnever enough\" insisted\nanother, while one taster\npointed out that the eggs\nwere a bit dryer than usual.\nAnother picture of a chicken.\nA Mars\nThe egg was nice, but one\nreviewer exclaimed \"please\nlet me out of here,\" while others declared themselves incapable of writing any coherent\nsentences with this much\nsugar in their bloodstreams.\nThe Mars bars didn't go anywhere quickly.\nOrganic Milk \u2022\nThis did little better than the\nOrganic Dark egg - \"tastes of\nfish\" and \"vomit e scents meg\" sprung to the lips of\nour reviewers. Other chocolate also sprung to their lips\nas they struggled to get rid of\nthe taste. No bonus again -miserable!\nCaramel \u2022\n\"I feel sick\" stated one\nreviewer before this egg was\neven opened, probably due to\nexcessive chocolate con-sump tion. This egg was generally a bit average, and\nnobody was in the mood for\nthe run-of-the-mill two bars of\nCadbury's Caramel.\nA Minstrels\n\"I don't like the foil on that\"\nexclaimed one expert, complaining the blue was a bit\ngarish. There were two small\neggs rather than a single big\none, and two packs of\nMinstrels. Opinions ranged\nfrom \"says 'Happy Easter'\" to\n\"not very nice at all.\"\n\u20224 Aero\n\"Dull,\" \"cardboard y and artificial\" exclaimed the panel.\n\"Too much air and not enough\nchocolate\" also summed up\nthe team's worries about the\namount of bubbles in the bars\nwhich accompanied the egg.\nIt was all much like \"sun-baked concrete,\" apparently.\nOrange Mini-Segments\nEasily in second place, this\nwas also the last egg to be\ntasted. Despite severe illness\nsweeping the tasting team,\nthe (admittedly limited)\norangey segments went\ndown vere will with a deliciously smooth orange-flavoured egg, if a bit soft.\n\n"
