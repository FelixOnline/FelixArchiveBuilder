Photo Credit: NOAA National Ocean service\nO\nceanic toxin levels have\nincreased due to harmful\nalgal blooms (HABs)\nwhich plague shellfish\nand in turn affect the humans\nthat consume them. Recently\nNOAA and partners deployed an\nunderwater robot that measures\ntoxicity. The robot, known as the\nEnvironmental Sample Processor\n(ESP), was made at the University\nof Washington, and will monitor\ncell and toxin concentrations of the\nHABs caused by Pseudo-nitzschia\non the north-west coast. ESP can\ndetect the toxin domoic acid which\ngives scientists a better assessment\nof the HABs\u2019 toxicity levels. The\ndata collected by the ESP will be\nsent to scientists, coastal managers\nand public health officials in near-real time so they can support\ndecisions related to potential\nshellfish harvesting closures. This\ndecision-making is critical for\nthe coastal communities that will\nexperience financial hardships due\nto the closure.\nA\nt Sh!t Sc!ence, we like to\nshow how all science is\nspecial, a little bouncing\n1-UP that your character\nruns towards to let it continue\nthrough the game. This version\nof Sh!t Sc!ence is a little different.\nBecause this week, I\u2019m not going\nto be talking about research that\nsounds silly, or useless. This week,\nI\u2019m talking about research that, to\nme, sounds so cool it makes my eyes\nwater a little bit.\nTo 30-year-old me, the game\nSuper Mario Bros was the source\nof the happiest and saddest times a\nten-year-old could ever experience.\nTwo dimensions, 8-bit music, and a\nmoustachioed plumber who could\nonly do one thing: hop, meant\nhours and hours of game play fun.\nBut game play in those days was\nhardcore. You got a set number of\nlives, and when you lost them, you\nwere out. End of game. Mental\nBreakdown. You would always hear\nabout that kid, the friend of a friend\nItsame! Mario! Photo Credit: Sergey Galyonkin\nMARIANNE GUENOT\nSh!t Sc!ence\nReminiscent geeks confirm: Super Mario Bros is hard\nof a friend, who actually finished\nthe game. The story of the kid who\ndefeated Bowser would spread like\nan urban legend. But for you, it was:\nstart all over again and die at the\nexact same place. Again.\nThat unassailable sense of defeat\nhas haunted me throughout the\nrest of my life, a tiny niggling\nreminder that no matter how hard\nI tried at that game, I always failed.\nBut now the children of the 80s\nhave grown up and are using\nmathematical proof to show\nthat we weren\u2019t all that stupid.\nIn a paper that will be presented\nat the FUN16 conference, the\n8th\nInternational Conference\non Fun with Algorithms,\na group of mathematicians\nfrom MIT, the University of\nOttawa, and Bard College at\nSimon\u2019s Rock, will present their\nlatest mathematical analysis\nbreakthrough which proves,\nonce and for all, that Super\nMario Bros. is super super hard.\nThey show that the problem\nof solving a level in Super\nMario Brothers is as hard as\nthe hardest problems in the\n\u201ccomplexity class\u201d,meaning that\nit\u2019s even more complex than the\ntravelling-salesman problem, or\nthe problem of factoring large\nnumbers, or any of the other\nhard problems belonging to the\nbetter-known complexity class:\nNP.\nThat\nsense of\ndefeat has\nhaunted\nme\nSophie Walsh\nWriter\nMars under the magnifying glass Science\n& the City\nV\nery few of us are here at\nImperial because we\u2019re\ninterested in the inner\nmachinations of the\npolitical beast. But as argued lately\nin FELIX, science and scientists\nneed to wake up and start caring\nabout science and policy. Besides\nbeing a way to sell ourselves better\nand increase funding from one of\nour largest donors (the government),\ngathering technical knowledge and\ntransforming it into human wisdom\nrequires prescience about how it will\naffect society. And one of the most\npowerful, overarching frameworks\nfor societal influence is politics.\nIn some fields, like theoretical\nmathematics, the link between\nscience and policy is difficult to tease\napart, but in others, such as climate\nstudies, it\u2019s quite obvious. Well\nknown governments desperately\nneed to start implementing policies\nto establish a future that\u2019s adaptable\nto rapidly changing climate\nconditions. Science is one of the\nonly tools through which we can\npredict what that future may look\nlike. However, policy-makers in\nthe UK and many other western\ncountries are largely not trained in\nscience,its technical language,or the\nimplications of it.As a result,despite\nthe existence of in-house policy\ntranslators, scientists themselves\nneed to be already tweaking their\nmessages for policy-makers.\nProfessor Martin Siegert of\nImperial recently co-authored a\npaper on the Totten Glacier of\nAntarctica, potentially predicting\nan additional three metres to ongoing sea level rise. These types of\nstark scientific numbers can serve as\npowerful political forces, but need\nto be framed the right way to get\nthe message across.\nSiegert argues that it\u2019s important\nfor the scientific community to\n\u201ctranslate scientific research to\ndecision-makers, wherever they are,\nas we have a loss of knowledge and\nexpertise as we move from science\nto decisions\u201d.\nWhile not all of us will be studying\npolitical sciences, we should always\nthink just how our research can have\npolicy impacts to benefit society,\nand be able to frame it accordingly.\nUltimately, this may be some of the\ngreatest meaning our work has.\nNAOMI STEWART\nUCL students love their geographic information systems so much, they have mapping parties. Photo Credit: Harry Wood\nSuper resolution imaging technology gives us views of Mars that may not be\nbreathtaking, but are most certainly very detailed. Photo Credit: Yu Tao and JanPeter Muller, UCL\nI\nget angry waiting for Google\nMaps to load on my iPhone\nand I tell this to Jan-Peter\nMuller, Professor of Image\nUnderstanding and Remote Sensing\nat the Department of Space and\nClimate Physics at UCL. He looks\nas if he\u2019s experienced a similar thing.\n\u201cIf you think 3G or GPRS is bad,\ntry processing an image of Mars\u201d.\nIt takes a 24 core, 96 GB ram\nmachine three whole days to process\na single image of Mars taken on\na HiRISE camera, a camera so\npowerful it had to be downgraded\nby the US Military before being\ndonated to science. Muller asserts\nthat these are the highest resolution\nimages ever seen by civilians from\nspace. Using The Martian to invoke\ndiscussion on Mars is becoming\nrather clich\u00e9d a year on from its\ncinema release, however, if ever we\nhad a chance to see Mark Watney\nwaving to us from his hydroponic\nMartian garden, this would be it.\nThe revolutionary new technique\npublished in Planetary Space Science\nby Muller and his co-author Yu Tao\nin April is called super-resolution\nrestoration (SRR). By stacking and\nmatching up to eight telescopic\nimages of the same area taken from\ndifferent angles, resolution can be\nincreased five times. So now each\npixel represents 5cm compared to\n25cm,meaningthatinthisparticular\ncase, we can tell why Beagle-2 failed\nfrom an orbit of 300km.\nThere is no doubt that being able\nto image in this way will aid our\nunderstanding and planning in\nspace exploration. Muller himself is\nin favour of human exploration and\ncolonisation of other planets.\n\u201cI am of the belief\u201d, Muller says,\n\u201cthat if we don\u2019t hurry up, then an\nasteroid will take us out and no one\nwill ever know we existed\u201d.\nSo far, so Armageddon. But\ndespite its \u201cenormous implications\u201d\nfor solar system exploration, it is\nactually the implications for our\nown planet that excite Muller. High\nresolution imaging could herald\ndevelopments in precision farming,\nurban planning, traffic control,\nvirtual reality technology, citizen\nscience and most pressingly,accurate\nassessment of environmental\nchange.\nIt takes a\n24 core,\n96 GB ram\nmachine\nthree whole\ndays to\nprocess\na single\nimage of\nMars\nHow new super resolution imaging technology can help mankind\nreach for the stars\n\u201cAt this point, it\u2019s a technology\ndemonstration,\u201d says Muller, \u201cbut\nthe computing power is likely to get\nmuch better\u201d.\nThat does not mean he has eased\noff developments in space.\n\u201cNext is the moon!\u201d he says, to\nalleviate the concerns of the \u201cflat\nearth people out there who still\nthink we never went (there)! And\nwe need to find Philae!\u201d\nMaybe he can do that whilst he\u2019s\nwaiting for those images of Mars to\nprocess.\nIf we don\u2019t\nhurry up,\nthen an\nasteroid will\ntake us out\nand no one\nwill ever\nknow we\nexisted\n\n"

I really enjoyed\nwatching it; mostly for the fact\nthat it\u2019s different from all the usual\nrom-coms. It doesn\u2019t have wishy-washy clich\u00e9s but rather it dives\ninto the complexities and realism of\nrelationships.\nTypically, one would expect the\ntwo main leads to get to know and\nfall for each other.They\u2019re supposed\nto be the quintessential couple that\nthe audience roots for. However,\nthis is not that kind of show. In fact\nin this show, I was rooting for the\ntwo main characters not to find each\nother and become a couple. Mickey\nand Gus are terrible, not just for\neach other, but also as people. They\nhave faults in completely different\nand very real ways.\nGillian Jacobs portrays the\ncharacter Mickey, the manager of\na radio station, who appears to be\nalmost an extension of her character\nfrom Community. She\u2019s loud but\nastute, and prone to impulsivity\nbased on little information.\nHowever, she\u2019s not the \u2018crazy-girl\u2019\narchetype as we see; although we\ndo see how deep-rooted some of\nher issues really are. Her story\nprominently features her radio-show boss, her quirky Australian\nroommate and her ex.\nOn the other side we have Paul\nRust as Gus, someone who seems\nthe typical \u2018nice-guy\u2019 but turns out\nto not be all that nice. He\u2019s an on\nset-tutor and wannabe writer on\nthe set of a supernatural series\ncalled \u2018Witchita\u2019. He struggles with\ntrying to be taken more seriously\nas well as dealing with precocious\nbut unhappy child actors. Later on,\nan attractive actor on set warms to\nhim in a way Mickey is hesitant to,\nwhich leads to troubles down the\nline.\nStepping away from the main\nstars, the ensemble cast are also\ngreat. Sure, they give generic advice\nnow and then but they all feel like\nreal people who have their own\nthing going. In particular, Mickey\u2019s\nroommate Bertie, played by Claudia\nO\u2019Doherty is charming. She could\nhave been nothing more than a\nsmiling joke but she\u2019s able to really\nshine in her role. A particularly\nmemorable episode is when Bertie\nand Gus go on a date and are\nmanipulated by Mickey to compete\nto be the worst date ever.\nA very nice touch in this series\n(also present in the equally great\nMaster of None) is the nature of the\nepisodes in general. Sure there is\nan on-going story and a serialised\nelement, but all the episodes are,\nto a degree, standalone and self-contained. It\u2019s a nice change of\npace from all the other shows we\nspend our time binge-watching.\nEach episode resolves around some\noccasion or incident like a party, a\nhang-out, or even just waiting for\na text message. In fact, you realise\nthe two leads don\u2019t actually spend\na lot of time together on the show.\nWe mostly follow their separate\nlives and problems; the two of them\ntrying to decide whether to actually\ngo for a relationship forms the glue\nof the show.\nWhen the show actually sends\nGus and Mickey on a date, we\u2019ve\ngrown fairly used to seeing them\napart.It makes us see the differences\nbetween the two, as well as their\nissues and how it ultimately leads\nto the interactions between the two.\nHarry Wilkinson\nWriter\nNot very\neventful,\nbut a great\nbreath of\nfresh air\nafter last\nweek\u2019s\nheartbreak\nWatch out! The needle is back! Photo Credit: HBO\nThis week on Games of Thrones\nIt\u2019s season six, episode six!\nT\nhis week\u2019s episode came\nwith a lot of throwbacks\nto characters of previous\nseasons. Hope you\u2019ve got\na good memory.\nWe open with a return to Meera\ndragging Bran away from the\nWhite Walkers (moment of silence\nfor Hodor) while Bran has frantic\nvisions, contrasting the Ice of the\nWhite Walkers with the Fire of the\nMad King screaming \u201cBurn them\nall\u201d. This gets derailed when some\nbloke rides up on a horse looking\nlike one of the Nazgul from Lord of\nthe Rings (or my Skyrim character)\nand takes out the Wights with a\nfire mace. Pretty badass stuff in all\nhonesty. Later in the episode we\nreturn to them and it is revealed\nthat the mysterious rider is in fact\nBenjen! Remember? From five years\nago? I told you you\u2019d need a good\nmemory.There\u2019s a short explanation\nof how this happened.He was about\nto turn into a zombie before the\nChildren of the Forest stabbed him\nin the heart, because it went so well\nin the past.\nBit of a change of pace now as\nwe turn to Sam and Gilly heading\nto his family home. Sam gives her\nthe cover story then drops the fact\nthat his dad would probably murder\nher given the choice. She seems\nsurprisingly cool with that, then\nyou remember what her dad was\nlike and you understand why. The\nmeeting with the sister and mum\ngoes pretty well, lovely people, it\u2019s\nonly at the family dinner when\nthings start to turn south. Randyll\nTarly really is a scary, scary man and\nyou can see the effect he still has\non Sam, beating him down to the\npoint where he can\u2019t defend Gilly.\nEventually, Mama Tarly fires back\nand leaves the table. Sam goes to\nGilly\u2019s room to say goodbye before\ndeciding against it and taking her,\nthe baby and his father\u2019s Valyrian\nSteel sword with him. I can\u2019t see\nhow he\u2019s gonna spin this to fit in\nwith his Night\u2019s Watch vows.\nWe finally have some development\nwith Arya\u2019s story this week as she\ngets to know her target, who is by\nall accounts a great actor, and lovely\nlady. You can tell the writers had\ngreat fun writing the backstage\nscenes between the actors, hopefully\nall the sass and competitiveness (as\nwell as the hiring of hitmen) isn\u2019t\nquite accurate to the actors on the\nshow. The climax comes when Arya\ndecides not to kill the actress and\nwarn her about the understudy who\nhired her. Confirming that Arya\nwill not become a Faceless Man.\nShe retrieves Needle from where\nshe stashed it and hides in a cave\nin the dark, waiting for the Waif to\ncome and kill her. Now THAT is\nhow you quit a job!\nHeading back to King\u2019s Landing\nand we see the Tyrell troops\nheading to rescue Margaery after\na truly rousing speech from Mace\n(brought a tear to my eye). A short\nstandoff between Jaime and the\nHigh Sparrow Sanders ensues\nbefore it is revealed that Tommen\nhas become a BernieBro and that\nthe huge gathered crowd will not,\nin fact, get to see Natalie Dormer\u2019s\nboobs. Shockingly, this doesn\u2019t lead\nto a riot, instead leading to huge\ncheers from the audience as Jaime\nand Mace must stand down. Jaime\nis then fired from his job as Lord\nCommander of the Kingsguard\nand told he is being sent to help the\nFreys (Remember? From Season\nthree?) retake Riverrun. We are\nthen treated to a short scene of\nWalder Frey having a go at his son\nand sexually harassing his\u2026 wife?\nDaughter? It\u2019s hard to tell with this\nshow.\nWe finish with a Daenerys scene,\nnot anything substantial in a story\nsense, just bringing up the fact that\nshe needs 1000 ships to transport\nher army (conveniently the same\nnumber that Euron said he was\nbringing over) and hopping back\nonto Drogon and giving another\nbadass speech, I imagine Daario\u2019s\ngetting pretty sick of them by now. I\nsuppose the point of this scene is to\nshow both that Drogon has gotten\nbloody massive and that Dany\nfinally has some control over him,\nbut honestly it felt pretty redundant.\nThe title of this episode, \u2018Blood of\nmy Blood\u2019, links into many of the\nstories going on here, with many\nof the younger characters ditching\ntheir family ties for the relationships\nthey chose for themselves: Sam\nleaves his family for Gilly, Tommen\nleaves his family for Margaery and\nthe both of them leave their families\nfor the Church. This contrasts,\nof course, with Arya leaving the\nFaceless Men, becoming a Stark\nagain when she gets Needle back\nand Bran reuniting with his Uncle.\nAll in all, not very eventful, but a\ngreat breath of fresh air after last\nweek\u2019s heartbreak.\nLong time no see! How are Ned and Cat? Photo Credit: HBO\nPretty\nbadass\nstuff in all\nhonesty\nThings go right, but things also\ngo wrong and this is a refreshing\nchange from all the typical romantic\nstories we\u2019ve seen or are accustomed\nto. It\u2019s not that the characters\naren\u2019t seeking love, there\u2019s just an\nabundance of selfishness and self-loathing to overcome on the journey.\nAn interesting aspect that\u2019s\nshown in the series is the current\ngeneration\u2019s fixation on text\nmessages, or just messages in\ngeneral. We see how big a part they\nplay in relationships, for better or\nIt dives\ninto the\ncomplexities\nand\nrealism of\nrelationships\nfor worse, and the problems people\nface when they become too overly\nreliant on, or analytical of texts.\nOutside of the whole, \u2018will they\nwon\u2019t they\u2019story, there are some nice\nmoments in-between. Mickey and a\nfriend take drugs and go on a wild\nadventure on a subway. Similarly,\nGus meets up with his friends\nregularly to make up theme songs\nfor movies which don\u2019t have them.\nThere\u2019s general comments about\nSpaceballs, and Pretty Woman among\nother movies and things. The world\nfeels filled-in and natural with lots\nof little nuggets of enjoyment here\nand there.\nAt the end of the day, Love is\nvery much its own thing and plays\nwith a lot of things that have little\nto do with the title. It\u2019s not that\nlove is something which can\u2019t be\nsought, but rather that there are a\nlot of obstacles and issues that need\nto be dealt with in the process. No\ncharacter is who you think they\nare on first viewing and all the\nperformances are top-notch.\nThis might not be the kind of\nshow for people who don\u2019t like\nawkward situations. For everyone\nelse, this show is rewarding due to\nits rejection of standard tropes, its\nbluntness, as well as the fact that it\u2019s\nsimply funny.\nLove is available on Netflix\nFast food is the way to a person\u2019s heart.

Different categories would\nsee individuals try and emulate\na particular type of individual,\nsuch as the \u2018executive realness\u2019\ncategory, which involved dressing\nup as fantasy 80s businesswomen,\nshoulder-pads and all.\nThe stylish film opened up\nthe world of balls to the world,\nshowing us the beating heart that\nlay at the centre of the glamour\nand glitz: people would be adopted\ninto \u2018families\u2019, which would unite\nunder a \u2018house mother\u2019, serving as\na make-shift support network for\nmarginalised members of society.\nNot only were the individuals\nfeatured in the film ostracised\nfor being queer, but they were\noften separated from the rest of\nthe mainstream gay community,\nin virtue of their skin colour and\ngender identity. Paris is Burning\ncharts the lives of a number of queer\nand trans people of colour, such\nas Pepper LaBeija, mother of the\nHouse of LaBeija, whose legendary\ncommand continued for thirty\nyears. While their stories are brave\nand extraordinary, they are rarely\nuplifting: Angie Xtravaganza, who\nran away to New York at the age of\n13, and died of AIDS shortly after\nthe film was released, only 28 years\nof age; or Venus Xtravaganza, a\ntrans-woman and sex worker, whose\nmurder forms a major turning\npoint in Paris is Burning. These\npeople did not lead charmed lives,\nbut their work, their sacrifice, their\nimmense love for those cast out of\nsociety helped pave the way for the\nmodern intersectional queer justice\nmovement.\nThe impact of Paris is Burning is\neverywhere; from memes on Twitter\nabout spilling the tea, to pretty\nmuch every single line quoted on\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, the impact\nof the ball scene has shaped the\nmodern cultural landscape. Not all\nagreed with Livingston\u2019s portrayal\nhowever, and feminist writer bell\nhooks slammed her for reducing the\nperformance of black bodies to a\nmere spectacle for white consumers.\nBut to approach the work in such\na way seems to belie the openness\nwith which those featured shared\ntheir lives,and the powerful message\nthat can be taken away at the heart\nof the film. Livingston herself said:\n\"It's about survival.It's about people\nwho have a lot of prejudices against\nthem and who have learned to\nsurvive with wit, dignity and energy.\nIt's a little story about how we all\nsurvive\".\nSo what exactly is shade, then?\nWell, in the legendary words of\nDorian Corey: \"shade is I don't tell\nyou you're ugly but I don't have to\ntell you because you know you're\nugly ... and that's shade\".\nFRED FYLES\nOh, the shade of it all!

However,\na study from North Carolina State\nUniversity showed that posting\nabout alcohol on social media might\nactually yield more information\nabout the poster\u2019s risk of alcoholism\nthan their actual drinking habits.\nThe researchers, who surveyed 364\nactively drinking undergraduate\nstudents, found that the regular\nconsumption of alcohol was\nconnected with a certain \u201calcohol\nidentity\u201d, meaning the behaviour\nwas considered an integral part of\nwho the students were.This identity\nwas broadcast on social media\nnetworks to coordinate, advertise\nand facilitate drinking. The\nresearchers hope that their findings\nwill help identify individuals at risk\nof alcoholism and aid policymakers\nin intervening where strong alcohol\nidentities may indicate high risk\npopulations.\nThompson & Romo 2016 @\nJournal of Health Communication\nLef Apostolakis\nScience Editor\nMany organisms on earth have\nco-adapted over millions of years\nand are now codependent. This\ncodependence can be the cause\nof a mutual extinction though, if\none organism becomes threatened.\nThis is the scenario a tiny tentacled\nflatworm is facing, as it lives on\nthe surface and often in the gills\nof a small freshwater crayfish from\neastern Australia. The many species\nof mountain spiny crayfish have very\nsmall ranges and 75% of all species\nin the continent are endangered or\ncritically endangered. Researchers\nfrom the UK and Australia looked\ninto the risk of co-extinction\nthrough the use of computer\nsimulations. They found that if\nall mountain spiny crayfish went\nextinct, 60% of all temnocephalan\nsymbionts would follow the same\nroad to oblivion, starting with\nthe most evolutionarily distinct\nlineages. Such an event would mean\nthe loss of up to 100 million years of\nevolutionary history.\nMcGregor et al. 2016 @ Learning\nDisabilities Research & Practice\nThe booze\nidentity\nThe end of\nco-adaptation\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to cram the\nnight before an exam, this may not\ncome as a surprise to you, but a new\nstudy has identified the crucial role\nof REM sleep in the process of\nmemory consolidation. The team\nof researchers at the RIKEN Brain\nScience Institute, Japan, identified\na particular brain circuit, the\nmanipulation of which can prevent\nor enhance memory retention in\nmice, even during non-REM sleep.\nThe researchers noticed that normal\nsleep helped mice remember the\ntexture of surfaces. The brain\ncircuit responsible for texture\nperception was then manipulated\nat different stages of sleep, through\nsleep deprivation, silencing of the\npathway and even stimulation of\nartificial activity in the brain of the\ntest subjects. Depending on the\nmanipulation, mice either failed to\nremember familiar textures, or at\ntimes their memory became twice as\nstrong as normal. So don\u2019t sacrifice\nyour sleep kids. Especially the night\nbefore an exam.\nMiyamoto et al. 2016 @ Science\nMany studies over the years have\nhighlighted the importance of\nour surroundings for mental and\nphysical well-being.Earlier this year,\nProfessor Mark Nieuwenhuijsen\nfrom the Centre for Research in\nEnvironmental Epidemiology\nclaimed that living near expanses\nof green could prolong lifespans.\nSo it comes as no surprise that\nliving near landfills might have the\nopposite effect. Researchers in Italy\ninvestigated whether air pollutants\nemitted from landfills could have\nadverse effects on human health.\nThey monitored 242,409 people\nfrom the Lazio region from 1996\nto 2008. They found a strong\nassociation between deaths caused\nby lung cancer and other respiratory\ndiseases, and hydrogen sulphide,\nas people living near landfills were\nexposed to on average seven times\nthe concentration of the pollutant\nin comparison to people living a safe\ndistance from landfills (e.g. Rome).\nMataloni et al. 2016 @\nInternational Journal of\nEpidemiology\nNap powered\nmemories\nWhy no one\nlikes landfills\nG\nood news for England;\nteen pregnancies have\nhalved in the last\n15 years. The newly\npublished Lancet study aimed\nat investigating the effect of the\nTeenage Pregnancy Strategy (TPS)\nimplemented by the government\nin 1999, the purpose of which was\nto reduce social exclusion of young\nparents due to teen pregnancy.\nThe decline was more evident in\ndeprived areas and in areas where\nmore strategy-related resources were\ndeployed. Although there is a global\ntrend of pregnancies occurring later\nin the life-cycle of women than they\ndid in earlier times,due to education\nand career often taking priority, the\ntrend has been more apparent in\nEngland since the TPS came into\neffect, suggesting the governmental\npolicy had a strong effect on the\ntargeted demographic.\nWellings et al. 2016 @ The Lancet\n16 and not\npregnant\nI\nwas perusing \u2018What to Eat\u2019\nby the fabulous nutrition\nprofessor Marion Nestle, and\nwas particularly intrigued\nby her short piece elucidating all\nthe hoo-ha around yoghurt. Say\nthe word \u2018yoghurt\u2019 just once and\nyou\u2019re more likely than not to get\na ho-hum reaction. Is it a health\nfood? Breakfast? Dessert? And wait\n\u2013 is greek yoghurt actually from\nGreece? Well, let\u2019s start with\nthe basics. Yoghurt is essentially\nfermented milk. That 180g tub\nyou\u2019re holding right now has at least\n100 million living Lactobacillus and\nStreptococcus bacteria per gram.\nThat\u2019s 18 billion live bacteria going\nin your gut. You start off with a\nmilk of some sort, be it skimmed,\nwhole or low-fat, and that\u2019s\npasteurised to kill any unwanted\nbacteria. Then the friendly bacteria\ncultures Lactobacillus bulgaricus and\nStreptococcus thermophiles are added,\ntogether with \u2018hardier\u2019 cultures\nacidophilus and bifudus strains\nbecause the former two are more\ndelicate, otherwise known as the\nweakling strains.Whatever the type,\nthey all work hard to digest the milk\nnutrients, producing plenty of lactic\nacid in the process, the substance\nthat gives yoghurt its characteristic\ntang. Many of these strains are\ncapable of replacing harmful\nbacteria in the gut; therefore yogurt\nis typically categorised as the holy\ngrail of gut health.\nA large body of research has\nproven that Acidophilus, along\nwith some other Lactobacillus and\nBifidus strains, do actually survive\nthe digestion process, which is\nnot entirely surprising given the\nfact that most are already present\nin the human gut anyway. These\nlovely creatures also consume\nlactose in dairy products, making\nyoghurt (or even your froyo \u2013 yes!)\nmore tolerable to those who are\nlactose-intolerant. Furthermore, a\ngroup of scientists in 2004 wrote a\nparticularly comprehensive review\non how yoghurt cultures, be it those\nweaklings or the hardier boys, are\ncapable of alleviating symptoms of\nconstipation, inflammatory bowel\ndisease and even colon cancer.\nThe problem lies in the mass-produced versions. I get a little\ncranky thinking about how much\nsugar is stuffed into brands marketed\nfor toddlers and older children\u2013\nmore than half of your typical GOGURT tube is pure sugar. Same\ngoes for Stonyfield\u2019s YoBaby organic\nyoghurts. All the \u2018low-fat\u2019 labelling\ndoesn\u2019t help, because it usually\nmeans all that fat is just replaced\nwith sugar. I\u2019d think it would be a\nfar better idea to teach children\nhow to appreciate something other\nthan \u2018sweet\u2019, and leave the sugary\nstuff for real dessert. It\u2019s fine to give\ninto the sugar-injected yoghurt and\ngranola pots once in a while, but\non your holier days, try leaving the\ndairy aisles with \u2018bio\u2019 yoghurt, or\nunflavoured sorts with plenty of live\nbacteria, and the fewest sweeteners\nand chemical additives. Shun your\ninner American.\nALEXANDRA LIM\nYoghurt, bitches. Photo Credit: Jules\nCreamy heavenly probiotic goodness\n\n"

Countless\nenemies have dared to invade us, all\nwith the most unsuccessful results.\nSince Roman times, we have always\nresisted, preferring death to yield \u2013\nalways united against tyranny and\noppression. We have survived Great\nFires, Nazi bombings, terrorist\nattacks. And we never faltered.\nWe had never surrendered our\nindependence.\nSadly, at some point, we ceased to\npay attention, and independence is\nnot the case anymore. We are not as\nself-sustaining as we used to be.\nThe great City of London is ruled\nby a large bunch of bureaucrats in\nWestminster, in which only 11% of\nmembers of parliament represent\nLondon constituencies. Long gone\nare the days of the great old City\nof London. Our self governance\nis a myth, a childish, historical\nfunfact. All the laws that come\nfrom Westminster, which clearly\nfavor the rest of England and the\nUK much more than they favor us,\nMen benefit from feminism, but need to know when to listen\nChristopher Worsfold\nWriter\nW\ne\u2019ve all been there\n\u2013 you finish your\nexams and suddenly\nthere\u2019s a deep hole,\na lack of purpose in your life. What\nelse was I to do but pick up FELIX\nand read Arnold Tan\u2019s \u201cmessage to\nfeminists\u201d.\nIn his article, Arnold gave his\nview on the feminist movement,\narticulating his own helpful\nsuggestions. However well\nintentioned, for me it felt all too\nreminiscent of the Onion article,\n\u201cMan finally put in charge of\nstruggling feminist movement\u201d.\nArnold is by no means the first\nman to feel that the feminist\nmovement could do with his input.\nCan we stop talking over women?\nIf you, like me, spend too much\ntime on Twitter, you\u2019ll have seen\nPiers Morgan recently giving his\nvaluable insight into what feminism\nis doing wrong, tweeting \u201cRIP\nfeminism\u201daccompanied by a picture\nof Emmeline Pankhurst next to a\ntopless Kim Kardashian. I wonder\nwhat an early 20th\ncentury Piers\n(undoubtedly still writing in the\nDaily Mail) would have thought\nof Emily Davison, the woman who\ndied throwing herself in front of the\nking\u2019s horse campaigning for votes\nfor women. RIP feminism?\nThis got me thinking more widely\nabout why men (I must confess\nmyself included) feel the need to\ninvolve themselves with feminism.\nBecause in all honesty, what insight\nare voted for by English, Scottish,\nWelsh and Northern Irish MPs,\nwhich are obviously not in line with\nthe interests of ordinary Londoners.\nHow did London surrender its\nindependence to the rest of the\nUK? It all started as a trade deal,\nin which our political decisions\nwere ours to make, but there was\na general agreement to cut tariffs\nbetween London and the UK. This\nthen slowly started turning into our\ncurrent unsustainable situation.\nWe started to allow free\nmovement of people between the\nCity of London and the UK. We\nsomehow agreed to share some\ncommon principles. And England,\nsuspicious of our independence,\nbuilt Westminster close to the\nCity to compete with us, filled it\nup with members of parliament\nfrom constituencies coming from\nthe whole of the UK, and thus set\nthe age of British dominance in\nLondon politics.\nA great example of this problem\nis immigration: London has lost\ncontrol of its borders. This imposed\npolicy of open-door immigration\nwith England has collapsed our\ncity. We need to take back control\nof our borders. We want to decide\nwho comes in,and whether we want\nimmigrants from all over the UK to\ncometoLondontoclaimourcouncil\nhouses, collapse our transport\nsystem and steal our jobs. Why do\nwe have to host, for example, so\nmany northerners in London? Why\ncan't we democratically decide how\nmany should come in?\nLondon needs to leave the UK.\nThis should be crystal clear to\nanyone. A referendum should be\ncelebrated as soon as physically\npossible. Some people argue that\nLondon is too small to be able to\nnegotiate its own trade deals with\nthe rest of the UK and the world.\nAll those people should keep in\ndo we have to offer that another\nwomen could not? Are we really\nso special to believe 50% of the\npopulation need our help?\nBut \u2018help\u2019 men do. If you\u2019re\nfamiliar with odd bits of Twitter, or\nOrange Is The New Black, you might\nhave heard of Matt McGorry. He\u2019s\nthe guy that plays that \u2018nice\u2019 prison\nguard that sleeps with the inmates.\nYeah, that guy, he\u2019s a #malefeminist.\nWhether he\u2019s posing with the\ncurrent great feminist work he\u2019s\nreading, or arguing with Piers\nMorgan on Twitter, McGorry is\nfighting the good fight. Although\nfor McGorry, that doesn\u2019t always\ninclude listening to women \u2013 he\u2019s\nwell known for blocking women\nthat criticise his brand of feminism.\nBut, perhaps he knows best; after\nall, he has read quite a few books.\nSo should men self identify as\nfeminist? More often than not,\nhowever good your intentions, you\nare likely to overstep your bounds\nand hinder rather than help. And\nthis is because, however much you\nread, men simply don\u2019t have the\nsame lived experiences as women;\nwe don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to go\nout knowing that at some point you\nwill get groped,to be catcalled in the\nstreet walking home in your school\nuniform, to know that walking\nhome at night alone is dangerous\nand that one women is killed in the\nUK every three days by a current\nor former partner, and to always be\ntold that you are exaggerating your\nexperience of sexism and that you\u2019re\nbeing hysterical.\nThe rest of\nthe UK is an\neconomic\nmess, and\nLondon\nshould stay\nout of it\nmind that London has had no\nproblem setting these deals since\nthe middle ages. Hell, even since\nRoman times we have been able to\nmake our own terms with respect\nto the world. The Queen still has\nto ask for permission to come into\nthe City of London. Our greatness\nis still there. We have been admired\nand respected by countless empires.\nIn this fast moving, complex world,\nwe are still relevant enough to\nnegotiate our own trade deals with\nthe rest of the world.\nWhy should London, the most\nprosperous region in the UK, have\nto share this vast amount of wealth\ncreation with the rest of the UK?\nHow many millions of pounds are\nwe sending to the UK every day?\nWhy should we back infrastructure\nprojects in the north of England?\nWhy should we fund industrial\nproductioninWales?Whyshouldn't\nLondon keep its wealth and spend\nit in its own health service? The rest\nof the UK is an economic mess,\nand London should stay out of it\ncompletely \u2013 for its greater good.\nWe must take back our democracy.\nWe must cease to be ruled by UK\nbureaucrats. We must finally take\nback control of our borders. A\nreferendum must be held, and we\nshould categorically, assertively and\nwith the pride of an admirable,2000\nyear old great city, must certainly\nvote Leave. The fight for freedom\nmust go on until it is won, until our\ncity is free, happy and worthy of all\nthe Londoners who died defending\nit.\n(PS, in my next article, I'll talk\nabout Hammersmith introducing\nan Australian star-point system for\nimmigration, so we can control our\nborder with Fulham. Oh, and I also\ndiscuss the implications of Pluto\nvoting to leave the Solar System and\nfinally regaining its long-dreamed\nindependence.)\nLong gone\nare the days\nof the great\nold City of\nLondon\nStop trying to get in on all the nice stuff we have. Photo Credit: driven.co.nz\nTerry Crews doesn't have time for your hypermasculinity bullcrap. Photo Credit:\nNBC\nThis leads to a problem though:\nwhat should we be doing?\nThe first thing is listening to\nwomen\u2019s experiences, because we\nsimply don\u2019t know. Then it\u2019s using\nthe position we have in society to\nenact change. Not by telling women\nwhat they should and shouldn\u2019t do,\nbut by talking to other men,from our\nown experience. Because traditional\nmasculinity can be toxic, it places\nunobtainable expectations on men,\nand these have a negative impact\non everyone. Whether it\u2019s men not\ntalking about their feelings because\nit\u2019s \u201cfeminine\u201d (or worse \u2013 \u201cgay\u201d),\n\u2018Lad culture\u2019, or the fact that men\nare more likely to commit suicide\nthan women, toxic masculinity is\ndestructive for both sexes, and it\u2019s\nall around us.\nFor me, Terry Crews, the former\nNFL player and guy in Brooklyn\n99, puts it best in his book on\nmasculinity. Crews says \u201cMy\nmessage to all men is that you have\nto kill pride, you\u2019ve been taught that\npride is a manly thing, that pride\nis a good thing. But the problem\nwith pride is that it stops you from\ngrowth.\u201d Caring about women\u2019s\nissues isn\u2019t anti-male,women\u2019s rights\nare human rights and human rights\nare women\u2019s rights. But, if you\u2019re\na man, before you decide to tell\nwomen what they should be doing,\nmaybe consider what you should be\ndoing first.\nMatt McGorry \u2013 the wokest of baes.

Having\na natural sweet tooth, my love for\ncake in particular has transformed\nthrough the last 20 years of my\nlife to an almost uncontrollable\npsychological problem \u2013 the one\nand only symptom being that I\ncannot stop thinking about it. I\u2019d be\nplanning my next trip to Columbia\nRoad market to pick up one of Lily\nVanilli\u2019s amazing tarte au citron on\nmy tube journey to college. I\u2019d be\nanalysing the layers of contrasting\nflavours and textures of a chocolate\ngate\u00e2u during lectures. And at\nthe end of the day, putting all the\nremaining cake-fueled brain power\nto use in writing articles such as the\none you are reading right now.\nOn a particularly bad day, possibly\ntriggered by the high levels of stress,\ncortisol and hypoglycemia, I\u2019d\nlook at anyone blankly in the eye\nmuttering: \u201cI want cake.\u201d Luckily\nfor me the Library Caf\u00e9 happens to\nsupply a good enough raspberry and\nwhite chocolate muffin to keep me\nsane.\nOn a good day, normally on\na weekend when I am actually\nbothered to get out of my oversized,\nworn out sweater and make myself\nlook slightly more presentable, I\u2019d\nhead off to WA caf\u00e9, my favourite\nplace for all things cake, located just\na short walk from Ealing Broadway\ntube station. Living in between\nHolland Park and Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nmeans I\u2019m conveniently five stops\naway on the Central line as opposed\nto the eleven stops on the District\nline from South Kensington.\nWA caf\u00e9, owned by a Japanese\np\u00e2tissier by the name Mayumi\nNakahara, is a small independent\ncaf\u00e9 boasting a range of pastries\nproduced on-site by their skilled\np\u00e2tissiers every day. Their pastries\nare strongly influenced by the\nFrench, yet mixes this unique style,\ngreat attention to detail and the\ncuteness exclusive to the Japanese\npeople into their creations, making\nthem quintessentially Japanese.\nAfter all the cakes I have ever\nallowed into my mouth in London,\nfrom the local Patisserie Valerie to\nthat posh, pink French patisserie\ndown Exhibition Road, WA caf\u00e9\u2019s\nare by far the best I can get without\na trip across the channel.\nWalking in through the clean glass\nautomatic doors you are greeted by\ntheir pristine creations of the day\nall lined up in neat rows in the\nglass display alongside other freshly\nbaked buns, croissants and biscuits.\nThe Japanese waitresses politely\nnod and smile at your entrance,\nwaiting behind the counter quietly\nas you devour the view in front of\nyour eyes with your back bent, while\neavesdropping on the local Japanese\nlady next to you ordering in perfect\nJapanese.\nTheir range of ten hardly ever\nchanges except for a few seasonal\nadditions, such as their cherry\nblossom mousse cake during the\nspring or the grapefruit pistachio\ntart in the summer. Despite this,\nI always spend an embarrassing\namount of time walking backwards\nand forwards in front of the counter\njust to make up my mind on what\nto get. Don\u2019t call me indecisive and\ngreedy \u2013 you too would be blinded\nby the colour, the immaculate detail\nand the beautiful smells drifting\nfrom their ovens behind.\nOn my fourth visit, I decided\nto treat myself to a proper eat-in experience at their wooden\ntables by the large window. While\nwaiting for my tea and cake, I\nimmersed myself into the peace,\ntranquility and cosiness in the\natmosphere, generated by the bright\nand simple interior. Their name,\nWA, in Japanese, means peace and\nharmony. Their choice of crockery\nis the perfect reflection of the\nJapanese people\u2019s style, attention\nto detail and respect for food. In\ntheir culture, each bowl and dish on\nthe table should complement the\nfood and contribute to the overall\nenjoyment of the dining experience.\nCakes are served on small, white,\nrustic-looking ceramic plates and\ntea in thick-bodied bowls on a black\nsaucer.\nBeinginaJapanesecaf\u00e9guarantees\na warming cup of matcha latte, the\ngreen tea version of your usual\ncoffee.Just something I always order\nwhereverpossibleasitremindsmeof\nhome.The strawberry shortcake, the\niconic representative of a Japanese\ntransformation of a Western classic,\nis a heavenly m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois between\nthe layers of sweet whipped cream,\nlight sponge and slices of the juiciest\nstrawberries.\nMy other three visits involved an\nextended trial of their creations.\nTheir signature choux trios is a row\nof three mini chou joined together,\nsandwiching whipped cream\nfeaturing three oriental flavours:\nblack sesame, matcha and azuki\n(red bean) custard. The choux \u00e0 la\ncr\u00e8me is again an amazing, crusty\nchoux pastry filled with vanilla\ncustard. I was more than delighted\nto find them still fresh and crunchy\nafter being in the fridge and taken\nhome \u2013 normally you\u2019d expect shop-bought choux to have absorbed all\nthat moisture in the air and had\nshrunken to a sad, chewy blob.\nThe raspberry and pistachio tart\nis a frangipane tart with a fragrant,\nbuttery crust with a lightly whipped\ncustard cream and embellished with\nfresh raspberries and was another\none that succeeded in retaining that\ncrunch. Their matcha rolled cake, a\ndelicate sponge with lightly whipped\nmatcha cream and azuki paste, uses\ntop-quality matcha powder from\nKyoto, Japan to give that unique\nscent and prominent bittersweet\nflavour in every mouthful. A more\nclassic choice would be the Mont\nBlanc, a whole candied chestnut\nenrobed with sweet whipped cream\nand covered with chestnut cream,\nall balanced on a crumbly almond\nfrangipane tart. And finally, the\nwhite sesame cheesecake with a\nfull-flavoured white sesame cream\ncheese and a crumbly black sesame\nbiscuit base.\nAll this writing made me crave\ntheir cakes again.

This is\npossibly one of the stupidest, most\nignorant statements ever committed\nto this paper. Everybody knows\nthat the library is hot from floors\nthree upwards, and as a result a\npetition has been signed by over\na thousand people in support of\nair conditioning, but the idea of\nspending \u00a313.5 million on what is\nessentially an unnecessary luxury\nis ludicrous and the union is better\noff concentrating on actual pressing\nissues.\nThere is also a problem with the\nway in which we have tried to go\nabout achieving this issue \u2013 at a\nuniversity with such consistently\nlow student satisfaction ratings,\nwhat makes any of us think that\nthey would go out of their way to\nview a petition that can be signed by\nanybody on a website which, unlike\nthe tobacco industry, Imperial\nCollege London has no links to.\nOne comment on the online\nversion of last week\u2019s article also\naddresses the fact that you can use\nyour own self-volition to write a\ncouncil paper and propose that the\nunion take a stance and petition\nfor this change rather than writing\na snotty article to indirectly accuse\nthe union of not doing enough to\nrepresent the Imperial student body.\nThis mentality is one constantly\nexhibited by Imperial students: they\nare unhappy with the state of certain\nIt's not that big of a deal (p.s. please sign our petition). Photo Credit: FELIX\nthings around campus but are either\ntoo lazy or indifferent to actually\nexact any change or do anything at\nuniversity that isn\u2019t study or drink.\nThe principal problem with this\nmentality is that frankly it\u2019s just\nselfish and ignorant: if the library is\ntoo hot, revise somewhere else \u2013 you\ncan go to SAF, various engineering\ndepartments\u2019 study rooms, cafe\u2019s,\nyour own room, or maybe, god\nforbid, you could do something\nother than study. It just seems so\nselfish, childish, and naive to claim\nthat the priority of the organisation\nthat is meant to represent the\nentirety of the Imperial student\npopulation should not focus on\nthe crisis of housing, the increase\nin tuition fees, the abysmal waiting\ntimes for the imperial college health\ncentre, the low student satisfaction\nthat Imperial perpetually maintains,\nor the lack of funding for 5th\nand\n6th\nyear medical students. Instead,\ntheir priority should be on making\nyourself more comfortable when\nyou do your work when there are\nplenty of alternatives that don\u2019t cost\n\u00a313.5 million.\nNow, in the paraphrased words\nof Aubrey Graham, \"I took a break\nfrom revision, now it\u2019s back to that.\"\nThis is\npossibly\none of the\nstupidest,\nmost\nignorant\nstatements\never\ncommitted\nto this paper\nDo you have something you want to get off\nyour chest?\nYou've only got two issues left to write for us!\nSend you pitch to comment.felix@ic.ac.uk by Monday\n\n"

Photo Credit: animal phase\nScratching an Itch\nInto and One Night Stand, two short narrative experiments, tell interactive\nstories in profound new ways\nI\nnto, or, I Turned My\nAutobiography Into a Fictional\nSecond-Person Surreal ComingOut-Of-Age Dramedy and Now\nMy Life Is Happier is not like many\nexperiences you\u2019ve interacted with\nbefore.In three short,distinct scenes\nit captures one person\u2019s coming of\nage. Across these the screen focuses\nequally on two hands, two heads,\nand two bodies. These are two\ndifferent people but together they\ntell the story of one.\nFew games are told from a\nsecond-person perspective and even\nless from the perspective of what\nseems like two people. When we\nview games in the third-person the\nplayer\u2019s role is as an omniscient god.\nOur own experience of seeing helps\nus understand what is happening\nwhen we play from a first-person\npoint of view. But playing from\nthe perspective of two people\ncauses problems; this is something\nwe, as humans, cannot relate to\nor even comprehend. At first this\nwould seem like an experience\nimpossible in real life, however,\nthis shared perspective could easily\nbe compared to the conflicting\nvoices and thoughts in our head.\nThe popular meme of the shoulder\nangel, and devil, is the closest we\nhave to this in mainstream media\nalthough it is never presented from\nan in-body point of view. Whether\ndeveloper animal phase consciously\nattempted to do this, they have\ncertainly achieved something\nunusual. They have opened up\nour imagination to new narrative\nperspectives, which will no doubt be\nexplored by independent developers\nin the future.\nAs the \u2018short interactive\u2019 fades to\ncredits, two blurred naked figures\nstand opposite in the shower. As\nthey touch, the two coalesce into\none. The journey to adulthood can\nbe seen as the coming together\nof multiple personalities and\nidentities. This is visual storytelling\nat its best and gaming at its most\nphilosophical.\nThe one night stand has a special\nplace in popular culture. Dazed and\nconfused, the protagonist wakes\nup in an unknown place beside\nan unknown sexual partner. This\nsituation can play out in a number\nof ways.\nMore often than not, in film\nand television, the quick getaway\nis the most popular resolution. In\nrarer cases, details are exchanged\nand friendship or further romance\nfollows. One Night Stand offers\nsix alternative endings, six ways to\nresolve a super awkward situation.\nMultiple endings, as the result\nof decisions made by the player,\nare nothing new and developer\nKinmoku doesn\u2019t pretend she\u2019s\ndoing anything revolutionary.\nMost games that offer this sort of\nbranching narrative are long and\ndon\u2019t particularly benefit from\nrepeated playthroughs. However,\nwhen a game is around a quarter\nof an hour in length the player is\nfar more willing to experiment and\nreplay the experience. Whether One\nNight Stand ever results in a truly\npositive ending is subjective but the\ndifferent stories told on the journey\nto these resolutions are rewarding.\nBorrowing from point and\nclick games, it is also incredibly\nsuccessful in creating a sense\nof mystery and capturing the\nexperience of waking up with a\ncomplete lack of information about\nyour surroundings. As you try and\npiece together the previous night,\nOne Night Stand also asks questions\nabout what sort of person you are.\nDo you brag to your friends after\nsuccessfully pulling? Do you invade\nsomeone\u2019s privacy to work out their\nname (which you\u2019ve forgotten)?\nThere is a real sense of fear that your\nalcohol induced amnesia will be\ndiscovered (unless you openly admit\nto it).In inspecting the environment\nyou learn a lot about the mysterious\nwoman you shared a bed with but\nOne Night\nStand offers\nsix alternative\nendings,\nsix ways\nto resolve\na super\nawkward\nsituation\nWho are you and why am I naked? Photo Credit: kinmoku\nnot a lot about yourself.So while the\nnarrative is branching, there\u2019s never\nreally any personal development\non your part. This is what makes\nOne Night Stand refreshing; it\u2019s not\nreally about you.\n\n"

Photo Credit: ICL\nAcademics from the School of Public Health say voting Remain is the \u201clogical\u201d option\nP\nrofessors and readers in\npublic health at Imperial\nhave published a letter in\nthis month\u2019s Journal of\nthe Royal Society of Medicine on\nhow staying in the EU would help\nsafeguard the health of British\npeople.\nThe letter, signed by 17 academics,\npoints to the economic downturn\npredicted by the Treasury should\nwe leave the EU, and the potential\ngovernment spending slash as a\nresult. The public health experts\nsay that this would mean either\nhuge cuts in the NHS budget or\nthe imposition of American-style\nhealth insurance.\nAll women applying to the MBA\nprogramme will be considered\nfor the scholarship. Imperial say\nthey\u2019re looking for candidates\nwith commitment to Fort\u00e9\u2019s\nmission of launching women into\npositions of leadership, as well\nImperial professors warn against Brexit\nThe letter also warned that\nour heavy reliance on healthcare\nprofessionals from Europe (we\ncurrently employ about 29,000 in\nthe NHS) would mean Brexit could\nleave us short-staffed, and endanger\nfuture recruitment efforts to fill in\ngaps in the workforce.\nThe letter goes on to say that\nhealthcare for Brits living in or\ntravelling around Europe would be\nunclear were we to leave the EU,\nand warned again of the prospect\nof health insurance fees where there\ncurrently are none.\nFELIX reported last week that\nImperial receives 20% of its research\nfunding from EU sources, and\nthe letter backed this up, saying\nthat the EU\u2019s current policy of\nfree movement of people between\nmember states allowed for the best\nscientists come together to do better\nresearch, which in turn allows for\nBritish institutions to climb the\nvarious world university rankings.\nThe letter also praised Erasmus,\nand warned that the government\u2019s\nuniversity budgets would likely be\nslashed if we left the EU.\nThe editorial emphasised the\ncollaboration between universities\nand how leaving the EU could\nendanger public health. Towards\nthe end, the letter got a little more\npolitical, stating that the road of\nnegotiation that would come post-Brexit would be long and arduous\nand could risk a renewed effort by\nScottish nationalists to leave the\nUK.\nImperial staff have not been shy\nabout putting their opinions on\nthe EU out there.

This did not\ngo down well. Photo Credit: FELIX\nHow much does the Rector get paid?\nAll this plus a parking space, presumably\nT\nhe college\u2019s Rector does a\nvery important job. They\ngo on Radio 4 for us,\nthey sign open letters in\nnewspapers, and if you\u2019re lucky and\nthey\u2019re not having a round off, they\nshake your hand at graduation. The\namount these members of staff get\npaid is always a point of contention.\nThis week, we took a look at how\nthe President\u2019s pay has changed over\nthe last fifteen years. In that time,\nwe\u2019ve seen fees for home students\nrisethreetimes,fivedifferentRectors\nand the building of a brand new\ncampus. Undoubtedly, the Rector\nhas the power to take the university\nin the direction they see fit. Roy\nAnderson controversially changed\nthe university logo from a coat of\narms to the corporate looking text\nwe have today, and Richard Sykes\ntried to introduce a student dress\ncode that would\u2019ve banned hoodies\nand the hijab on campus (which\nFELIX adamantly fought, by the\nway). Over the years, Imperial has\nbecome more business-oriented\n\u2013 the introduction of the Business\nSchool, the college\u2019s rebrand and its\nmultiple management restructures\nmeans that being Imperial\u2019s RectorPresident hybrid (as the post now\nis) is a lot like being a company\u2019s\nCEO.\nAnd is this reflected in the change\nin pay? Our graph above uses data\nfrom a Freedom of Information\nrequest and information freely\navailable on the college\u2019s website.\nInitially,weseeahuge60%increase\nin salary when Ronald Oxburgh\npassed the baton to Richard Sykes\nin 2001. The bump up in spending\nin 2008 when Anderson joined is\npartially explained by the fact that\nImperial had both him and his\npredecessor contracted to work as\nRector during July of of that year.\nAs you might expect, each new\nRector has received a modest pay\nrise on the previous man\u2019s wage.\nKeith O\u2019Nions\u2019 was perhaps the\nmost frugal few years as head. The\nfact that his presidency followed the\n2008 financial crisis probably has\nsomething to do with it. Andrew\nSykes\u2019 wage grew modestly every\nyear, meaning he arrived earning\n\u00a3251,000 and left receiving\n\u00a3348,000.\nEven now, President and Rector\nAlice Gast is paid nowhere near\nas much as Oxford\u2019s Chancellor,\nAndrew Hamilton, whose 2014/15\npaypacket at \u00a3462,000 makes him\nthe highest paid university leader in\nthe country.\nIn February, the Guardian\nreported that chancellor salaries had\ngone up 14% over five years \u2013 in the\nsame time Imperial\u2019s top job had\nincreased its remuneration fee by\n21%.\nWhile the average salary for a\nuniversity head sits at a modest\n\u00a3272,000, Alice Gast currently\nenjoys a total fee of \u00a3432,000 which\nincludes the college\u2019s contribution\nto her pension and \u00a325,000 worth\nof \u2018Other\u2019 \u2013 presumably the rent\non the townhouse that comes with\nthe job on Queen\u2019s Gate. Imperial\nisn\u2019t an average institution, but can\nit justify such a decadent pay packet\nfor those at the top when fees are set\nto rise? It probably can, yes.\nKeith O\u2019Nions\nAffectionately known as \u2018Keef\u2019 to\nstudents, and the only Rector with\nhis own parody Twitter account, Sir\nKeith stepped in as acting Rector\nafter Anderson\u2019s resignation in\n2009. Previously the chief science\nadvisor to the MoD before setting\nup a security science institute at\nImperial, he was the first to get the\njoint title of President and Rector\nafter a major reshuffle in the upper\nechelons of college governance.\nRichard Sykes\nAs well as trying to introduce a\ndress code for students, Sir Richard\nwas a long-term advocate for\nincreasing top-up fees. Back in the\nnoughties, when home students\nwere paying just \u00a31100 per year,\nthe government was considering\nraising fees. Whilst other Russell\nGroup chairs suggested \u00a33000 a\nyear, Richard Sykes told the world\nthat he thought a whopping annual\nfee of \u00a310,500 was justified.\nRoy Anderson\nSir Roy Anderson only took on\nthe job for a brief period starting in\n2008, before resigning at the end of\n2009. In an interview with FELIX\nhe said Imperial rising above\nOxford in the rankings was \u201cdoable\u201d\nand is the only rector of recent years\nto have done his undergraduate\ndegree at the college.\nHe was another Rector in favour\nof top-up fees, but rather less\naggressively than Sykes.\nAlice Gast\nImperial proudly boasted of\nappointing its female leader back in\n2014, when Alice came over from\nLehigh University in Pennsylvania.\nOf late, President Gast has been\nparticularly vocal about the\npossibility of Brexit, having sent\nout emails and signing open letters\nthat make no secret of her pro-EU\nstance.\n\n"

And if Hillary\nClinton doesn\u2019t sort out her\ncampaign strategy fast, he will win\na landslide victory.\nWhen Trump initially announced\nhis campaign, he was a joke\ncandidate \u2013 how could he, a man\nwho had previously claimed to be\na Democrat, have a hope of getting\nthe Republican nomination?\nOnce in the race, his objective\nwas to obtain attention quickly,\nwhich he achieved with an array\nof insulting statements and \u2018bold\u2019\npolicies. Of Mexican immigrants,\nhe said; \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs,\ncrime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d He pledged\nto build a wall along the southern\nborder and to \u201cmake Mexico pay for\nit\u201d, and he called for a shutdown on\nMuslim immigration.\nAll of this is preposterous, there\u2019s\nno doubt. But that didn\u2019t matter.\nAt this stage he wasn\u2019t trying to be\nelectable, he was merely trying to\nget noticed- and noticed he got. In\nthe following months he received\nover $2billion worth of free media\nattention. When his ratings went\nup, he used this attention to let\neverybody know. And somehow\nit got better for Trump \u2013 people\nactually bought into his ideas. With\nevery controversial statement he\nmade, thousands praised him for\nspeaking his mind, for challenging\npolitical correctness. The American\nright-wing was more stupid than\nanyone thought.\nHe had everything he needed:\nhuge attention and huge popularity.\nIt seemed only a matter of time until\nthe nomination was secured. People\ntuned in to the debates purely to\nwatch him \u2013 he became the man\nwho stood up for the silent majority.\nHe had convinced millions that\nthey wanted America to be great\nagain, whatever that means.\nHis story couldn\u2019t be more\ndifferent from that of career\npolitician Clinton. At the start of\nthe Democratic race, it was pretty\nmuch assumed that she would win.\nHer leading opposition was\nhardcore leftie Bernie Sanders,\na candidate who was initially\ndismissed as being unelectable on\naccount of his socialist policies. His\ncampaign is largely about getting\nbig money out of politics, and\nemphasising the need for a non-establishment president. Along with\nTrump,he has made the presidential\nelection all about fighting the status\nquo.\nClinton\u2019s reaction has been\npeculiar. Instead of emphasising the\nneed for someone with experience\nand knowledge rather than an\noutsider, she decided to desperately\ninsist that she\u2019s not part of the\nestablishment. Her reason? She\u2019s a\nwoman! She is trusted by neither\nthe left nor the right.The left thinks\nshe\u2019s controlled by the big banks\nand corporations who funded her\ncampaign and career, the right\nthinks she\u2019s responsible for the\nBenghazi attacks and would never\nvote for her because of her liberal\nstances on issues like abortion.\nShe\u2019s been associated with\nscandal and corruption her whole\npolitical life, including her private\nemail account currently under\nWho are we to vote on EU membership?\nTo be honest, we don't really know what we're talking about\nDesmond Cheung\nWriter\nA\ns the date of the EU\nreferendum approaches,\nwe are being flooded\nwith Remain vs Exit\narticles on all media. However,\nthis is NOT going to be another\nadvocating piece. In fact, I am\nwondering why one even gets to\nvote on such an issue at all.\nBefore you label me an\nauthoritarian-totalitarian-fascist\nand rush to attack me in the\ncomments section or dismiss this\narticle altogether, let me explain\nwhy I think the idea of referendums\ncontradict the fundamentals of a\ndemocratic process and effective\ngovernance.\nFirst, let's all take a step back and\nask ourselves: do we actually know\nenough? I am not trying to belittle\nyour intelligence, but we are talking\nabout conducting an analysis of the\nEU, which comprises 28 countries,\nforming the biggest economy in the\nworld (nominally). This is serious.\nConsider a crude analogy: would\nyou want an airbus to be designed\nby the population? Again, before\nyou rush to the comment section\nand cleverly point out the numerous\ndifferences, the analogy serves to\ndemonstrate that they both involve\nhighly complicated and delicate\nevaluations, which lead to long\nterm and lasting consequences.\nIn fact, I would further argue that\ndeciding whether a (your) nation\nshould remain in a political union\nis far more difficult; there is no\n\u201canalytical solution\u201d, hell, not even\na numerical one through some\nRunge Kutta method. Even if you\npersonally possess a cutting edge\ninsight regarding the matter and\naccurately predict what the future\nholds, what percentage of the\npopulation can do that? Far too\noften, opinions are being swayed\nby three minute Youtube videos\nor a ten minute read of an article\nwritten by an obviously biased (The\nEconomist ahem) source. These\nforms of media provide little to no\ngenuine contribution to solving any\nproblems. The bottom line is that\npeople who spend YEARS studying\neconomics can barely understand\nwhat is going on, so how can we\nhave possibly have figured it out?\nAt this point, the reader might\nrightly ask\u201cIf the general population\nis incapable of making difficult\nand well informed choices, what\nis the point of an election? After\nall, the population is selecting the\nperson who will lead their country.\"\nHere, I argue that the election of a\nperson is of a very different nature\nto a referendum on an issue. Sure,\ncandidates have campaign policies\nand parties are biased towards\ncertain ideologies, but an election\nmakes things personal. Ultimately,\nthe choice is based on our evaluation\nof the person, which I believe the\npopulation is far more capable of\nthan non-linear political-economic\nanalysis. It does not matter what\nacademic knowledge you hold,\nnor whether you went to Harvard.\nThrough daily interactions with\nour family, friends and enemies,\nour abilities to evaluate people have\nbeen developing from the day we\nwere born. An election is a process\nin which the candidate undergoes\npublic evaluation, the ultimate test\nof a candidate\u2019s character. Sure, we\nmight make mistakes sometimes,\nsuch as trusting the cheating piece-of-shit partner we loved; but there\nis currently no better way for us to\npick someone to lead.\nMoving onto the more general\nproblem I see here, I find the idea\nof entrusting difficult and complex\nissues to the public ridiculous,\nand it goes against everything I\nbelieve a democratic and effective\ngovernance should be. My idea of\na functional system is one in which\nthe population elects leaders with\nclear, strong and decisive standards.\nIn return, the chosen ones should\nlead decisively (with checks and\nbalances, of course). If Cameron\nbelieves that Remain is the way\nto go, he should have campaigned\nfor Remain during the election;\nif the UK thinks he\u2019s nuts, he's\nout of 10 Downing Street. Do we\nwant to descend into an unhealthy\nand unproductive spiral, where all\nparties go for saying \u201cwe will let\nyou decide later\u201d? What they are\nessentially saying is \u201cWhatever you\ninvestigation by the FBI, with\n30,000 \u2018accidentally\u2019 deleted emails\npresumed to have contained\ninformation about the Benghazi\nattacks. Trump is already referring\nto her as \"Crooked Hillary\u201d, and\nwill push this until November.\nIt\u2019s clear that she knows more\nabout almost every issue that could\ncome up. However, in the debates,\nhe will crush her. Trump has shown\nthat to win a debate you don\u2019t need\nto know anything about anything as\nlong as you can talk.\nHe will move categorically to the\nleft in order to pick up votes from\nthe currently undecided. Already\nwe have seen him abandon his\ndestructive foreign policy, saying in\nApril that \u201cthe power of weaponry\nis the single biggest problem in\nthe world\u201d. This will be effective\nbecause his Republican fans on the\nwhole don\u2019t care about policy \u2013 as\nlong as he remains The Donald he\u2019ll\nhave their undying support.\nHis early campaign was very\ninsulting to Mexicans and Muslims\nwho had little impact in the\nRepublican primaries. In May he\nacknowledged that his numbers\namong Hispanics were a big\nproblem, but said \u201cI have two more\npeople [Rubio and Cruz] to get rid\nof...once I start on Hillary you\u2019ll see\nthose numbers change.\u201d This shows\nthat he will dramatically change\nhis rhetoric now that he\u2019s won the\nLook at that man's tiny hands. Photo Credit: Gage Skidmore\nFeels, man. Photo Credit: AP\nWould you\nwant an\nairbus to be\ndesigned\nby the\npopulation?\ndecide,if you f*ck up,don\u2019t blame us,\nwe gave you the choice.\u201d Instead of\nshoving the decision back into the\nhands of the public,those governing\nshould conduct the analysis with\nall the talent they can find, subject\nto the population\u2019s query and\nopinion,come to a decision and take\nresponsibility for the outcome.\nDo not,for a moment,think that I\nam (or let people say you are) being\na coward for not wanting to make\nthe choice. We should be afraid of\nwhat the outcome will be given the\nmagnitude of the problem. We, 'the\npeople', are powerful because we\ndecide who will come to power, and\nnot because we get to decide upon\nthings that most of us can\u2019t even\nbegin to comprehend. Certainly,\nI might be overly ideological,\nunrealistic and have overlooked\nsome seriously obviously stuff.\nComing back to the real world,\nwhere we are being presented with\nsuch a referendum, we are aware of\nthe existence of complete lunatics\nand we are facing a choice, we\nshould do our best to comprehend\nand vote for what we believe in at\nthe moment \u2013 I just don\u2019t think this\nto be the way to go.\nLooking across the pond, god\nknows how much I despise and hate\nDonald, but at least he is confident\nenough in his (possibly delusional)\nsupporters to not hold a referendum\non building the Mexican wall.\nTo clarify, I\nthink Trump\nis abhorrent\nRepublican vote.\nThe way the two presumptive\ncandidates are already running their\nrespective presidential campaigns\nis very telling. Trump wants to\nMake America Great Again while\nHillary wants to be the first female\npresident. To the uninformed\nvoter I know which one of those\nsounds more appealing. She will\nresort to project fear. Already on\nher website the first thing that\npops up is \u201cWe can\u2019t risk a Donald\nTrump presidency\u201d. Her campaign\nwill be entirely anti-Trump, and as\ndangerous as a Trump presidency\nwould be,negative politics will never\nresonate as well as Trump\u2019s Make\nAmerica Great Again philosophy\nhas, especially given how bad a\ncommunicator Clinton is.\nTo clarify, I think Trump is\nabhorrent. He\u2019s the least prepared\npresidential candidate of all time\nand would be the worst thing to\never happen to America. If I could,\nI would vote against him. He is\nmarmite, and I concede that not\na tonne of Americans are fans of\nmarmite. But Hillary is out-of-date\nmarmite. Americans have shown\nthat to them, policy just doesn\u2019t\nmatter as much as personality,\nand unless Clinton makes radical\nchanges to her campaign strategy,\nshe\u2019ll make this a race between\nTrump and please-God-not-Trump.\nIt\u2019ll be all about The Donald.\n\n"
