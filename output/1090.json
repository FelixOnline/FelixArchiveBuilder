    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 6TH TUNE\nCourt summons for C& GU\ncontinued from front page\nHowever, fears were expressed that,\ngiven the fast approaching end of\nterm, the scope for spending on student activities would be limited.\nIn a separate development, it transpired that the cancellation of last\nterm'sC&G U Easter Dinner has\ncontinued to generate problems. An\nentertainments company, hired for\nthe night in question, is suing the\nUnion for breach of contract after the\ndinner was called off.\nDespite returning the contract\nunsigned, Mr Ayres received invoices and letters from the company\ndemanding the full payment of \u00a3700\nfor the booking. The firm maintains\nthat, in a telephone conversation with\nMr Ayres, a \"verbal contract\" was\nformed thus making C& GU, and\nsubsequently ICU, liable for the fee.\nCouncil heard how the dealings\nwith the company only came to light\nbeyond the inner circle of C& GU when a court summons arrived, portentously on the morning of the\nmeeting. Before this, Mr Misra and\nhis team had taken advice from Dr\nCrofton of the Mechanical\nEngineering department and attempted to \"meet the company half-way\"\nby sending \u00a3200 in payment of the\noutstanding invoice. This evidently\nproved futile as the firm took legal\nadvice and sought recompense via\nthe courts.\nThese revelations brought more\nexpressions of scorn and disbelief\nfrom Council members, who decided\nthat the summons would be dealt\nwith by ICU in consultation with its\nsolicitors, whilst the money from the\nsale of exam papers would be properly accounted for and banked.\nDebate then settled on the issue of\nwhether past exam papers from all\ndepartments could be sold or otherwise made available at some central\nlocation such as the Union Shop, perhaps at cost price. Council agreed to\ninvestigate this possibility, pending\nnegotiations with individual depart-ment s. In the midst of this discussion, the\nrepresentatives from C& GU left the\nroom. They have since been unavailable for comment. It is not known\nwhether moves to discipline the constituent college union and its executive will be initiated before the end of\nterm.\nPresidential race kicks off\nliable Crsw f KG NEWS TEAM The third and hopefully final election\ncontest for the post of Imperial\nCollege Union President for 1997-98\nhad a positive start this week when\nfour candidates achieved the full\nquota of twenty second ers. Papers for the post came down on\nWednesday this week heralding one\nand a half week's campaigning\nbefore voting in all departments on\n16th and 17th of June. Two other\nstudents had signed up for election,\nbut failed to gain the necessary number of second ers. The four fully nominated candidates are Paul Brown, a Mechanical\nEngineering Post-Graduate; Mo\nDulloo, Physics IV; Richard\nStultiens, Geology III; and Laurie\nTweedale of Computing III.\nHustings for the elections, a forum\nfor students to quiz potential\nPresidents' intentions, are to be held\nin dBs at 5.00pm on Monday 9th June and in Gladys' Bar at St Mary's on 11th June.\nNews in Brief\nIC GRADS TAKE OFF!\nResearch published in The Times\nand Guardian newspapers this week\nshows that Imperial College students\ntop the list when it comes to salary\nexpectations.\nBeating students from Oxford and\nCambridge into second and third\nplace, IC graduates expect to be earning at least \u00a318,200 in their first year,\ncompared to an average graduate\nwage of \u00a314,400. These rankings are\nmirrored in the salary expected after\nfive years employment, with IC\ngraduates refusing to get out of bed\nfor less than \u00a334,800, putting\nCambridge graduates' \u00a331,000 in the\nshade.\nOther results of the study, commissioned by The Times newspaper\ngroup and conducted by High Fliers\nResearch, reveal that 46% of IC students expect to start a 'graduate-type' job after leaving, just below the\ntop score of 50% by Aston.\nFinally, the organisation that came\nup most often in students aspirations\nof employment was the BBC, way\nahead of the Civil Service and self\nemployment. The survey allowed\nrespondents a free choice for this cat-e gory, producing esoteric results:\nNASA came 9th and Greenpeace\n26th, the latter beating KPMG, Sony\nand British Aerospace.\nLSE EXAM SHENANIGANS\nThe trials and trepidation s of\nImperial College students' examination experience pale in comparison\nwith that of computing students at\nthe London School of Economics.\nExaminees arriving for their finals\narmed with weeks of revision and\ncramming discovered that their\npreparation was all for nought.\nUnbeknownst to them, the exam\npapers held all the answers on a sheet\nattached at the back.\nSources reveal that none of the\nstudents drew attention to the error -each believed that they alone were\nrecipients of the gift. However, the\nin vigil at or s of the exam discovered\nthe extra sheet fifteen minutes after\nthe exam had started.\nCandidates have been told that\nthey must re-sit a different exam later\nthis summer.\nLADS BUNGEE TO NZ\nA team of students from Imperial\nCollege have scooped a free holiday\nin a travel competition organised by\nSTA Travel this week. The winner\nwill spend two weeks in New\nZealand after beating off competition\nfrom all over the country in STA's Adrenaline Challenge.\nThe team comprising Chris\nBalding (Physics II); Amir Hasan\n(Chem Eng II); Mike Powell (Aero\nII); and Andy Smith (Materials II),\nhad to answer questions about New\nZealand and complete high-ad rena line challenges such as Bungee\nRunning. Although running second\nfor most of the competition, which\nwas held at UL U on Tuesday night,\nthe team came back on the last ques-tion. Other universities who took part\nincluded Strathclyde, Manchester,\nGlasgow, Oxford Brookes and\nWestern England.\nTeam captain Amir Hasan\ndescribed the competition as \"a good\nb lag\" and said that he and his team\nmates were looking forward to see\nwhat the antipodes had to offer in the\nway of high-energy sports.\n\n"

It is juicy and ripe on the outside, with\npromise of more classically awesome tracks\nlike their chart topping You're Not Alone. But as\nyou bite into the album you hit a hard stone -that of dull mediocrity. The first track Miracle\nbegins with a swirling ambient two minute\nintroduction and it doesn't really get an better\nthrough its full seven and a half minutes.\nThere is a steady mix in styles throughout\nthe album, tracks like Curious combine a strange reggae/drum n' bass concoction, others sound like a more moody Everything But\nThe Girl. There is even a hint of hip hop in the\nlast track / Don't Think So which sounds like a sub standard Portishead B side.

It is produced very\nnicely and there are one or Iwo good tracks,\nSafer Hands and Blood Red Tears being the\ntwo. With a few good dance remixes, Olive\nwill flog at least another number one out of\nExtra Virgin.\nIf you buy this album expecting twelve brilliant dance tracks be prepared to have your\nfinger glued to the rewind button as You're Not\nAlone comes to its sublime end.

    "content": "After much controversy over its\ncontent since its\nscreening at the\n1996 Cannes Film Festival, David Cronenberg's Crash has\nfinally obtained an 18 certificate and is released uncut in\nthe UK. Based on a JG Ballard novel, the film deals with\nthe association of sexual excitement with car crashes and\nthe injuries they cause.\nAdvertising executive James Ballard (James Spader)\nand his wife Catherine (Deborah Unger) are unable to find\nsexual satisfaction inside or outside marriage. Following a car crash bel we en James and Dr Helen Remington (Holly\nHunter) in which her husband dies, James and Catherine\nfall in with scientist/photographer Vaughan (Elias Koteas)\nwho believes that car crashes result in \"a liberation of\nsexual energy\". Vaughan is so obsessed with car crashes\nthat he spends his time reconstructing fatal car crashes of\nmovie stars who became sex symbols after dying young,\nsuch as James Dean. The result of the couple's encounter\nwith Vaughan is that they too come to discover the sexual\npleasure that can be derived from road accidents.\nThe car crash is a fertilizing rather\nthan a destructive event.\nCronenberg has already gained a reputation for being\nan audacious and provocative film maker who perhaps\nhas a bit of a warped imagination; his most memorable\nwork includes The Fly and Dead Ringers. The idea for\nCrash is an intriguing one but beyond the sex and car\ncrashes, there is not much else. The film disturbs and\nshocks but has few other merits. The characters lack per\u00a9 son ali ty and as a result the audience\nfeels nothing for\nthem.\nAs for whether the film should have been banned, I agree with the view that it is wrong for one group of\nadults to decide what another group of adults can or\ncannot watch. What makes Crash so disturbing is the fact\nthat it deals with a form of human sexuality that has so far\nnot been examined in a mainstream film. However, the\nfilm is hardly going to encourage viewers to go out in their\ncar and crash it in order to obtain sexual fulfillment - the\ncharacters and their behaviour are more likely to disgust\nand repel than to encourage viewers to copy them.\nPersonally, I think Crash is a horrible film, but in light of\nall the hype and controversy which surround it, this is\nhardly going to stop people flocking to the cinema to see\nwhat all the fuss is about.

    "content": "6 PRESIDENTIAL MANIFESTOES FELIX FRIDAY 6TH IDNE\nSeconds away... Round three\nRoll up folks, it's here! The all new improved sabbatical elections.\nThis is your chance to decide who should be at the helm of next year's Imperial College Union. After two rounds of elections with only one\ncandidate, we now have six fighting-fit, raring to go candidates for the\nth rid and hopefully final round of elections.\nThey have submitted manifestoes, presented below, for you to read.\nStudy them carefully. Look at their mug shots. Come along to the hustings next week and grill them about their policies. Find out what they\nare going to do for your Union. Remember that the Union is not just a place to drink - it has an importance for everyone that goes far beyond\nthe beer prices...\nPaul Brown\nImperial College Union is run by its members, for its members, but this\noften seems to be forgotten. I intend to change this.\nStudents come to Imperial College for two reasons - to get a good degree\nand to have a good time. My priority as ICU President will be to help everyone achieve this.\nThe clubs and societies are one of ICUs great strengths, and this is where\nmy involvement with the Union originated. But ICU should also be there to\nsafeguard the welfare of its students. This extends from providing \u00a31 curries\nand a Women's Minibus on Wednesday and Friday nights, to representing\nstudents on issues such as funding and accommodation.\nAcademic representation is the single most important service that ICU\nprovides, but recent events have shown that it needs improving. Some problems can be solved by the Departmental Representative system, but bigger\nissues need a concerted effort from ICU and the CCUs. Many students have\nsuffered from the recent fiasco with The Tent, and already it is obvious that\nmore problems are on the horizon.\n.. . '\nICU needs a president who will take academic representation seriously. I am competent. I am committed. Vote for me. Please.\nMo Dulloo\nI 've said it before and I 'll say it again... Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop once in a while you could miss it. I 've stopped and taken a look at the\nstate of the Union and certain problems need to be addressed. Major issues\ninclude the Beit Quad renovation, Student Union expansion and facilities to\ncope with the increased number of students in 1998; Funding; Integration of\nthe Medics and Top-up Fees.\nI want to see all the Union Officers make better use of their roles. The\nrepresentation network already present has to be better implemented.\nI want clubs to realise where 'their' money is coming from and to place a greater emphasis on 'Our Students Union' rather than 'the Union'.\nI want to see the best solutions available and implemented for and on\nbehalf of the student. This will be done through consultation with all the\nSabbs and Union Officers.\nI want better harmony between IC students and the Medics to smooth our\ntransition. This will come through a mutual understanding and greater\nawareness of each other's differences.\nOur future is important to us. Let's get on with it. Vote for the no bullshit option.

This was\nborne out as we didn't achieve the\npromotion expected at the start of the\nyear by \"Captain courageous\" Steve,\nbut managed some notable per for Unfortunately it was never possible\nfor Steve to name an unchanged side\nand towards the middle of the season\nAlex was lost to the first team and\nnever really replaced, Dave managed\nto destroy his ankle and goalkeeper\nSteve had to stop playing due to\narthritis of the knee.\nIt was not all bad news as we did\nhave joining the team about this time\nthe Mighty Robo who added steel to\nor ies, not all of which can be mentioned due to space, but here's a few:\nthe best performance was coming\nback from 1-4 down at half time,\nafter two thirty-yard lobbed own\ngoals, to beat Goldsmiths 5-4.\nUndoubtedly the worst performance\nwas in the BUSA cup when we lost\neleven-nil, but the evening in the bar\nand the journey home nearly made\nup for it. The 5-1 loss away to\ngoal-a game scoring, \"Hardcore\"\nHajo's goal keeping, Will's sliding\ntackles, Dave's offside decisions,\nSteve's ridiculously cool lob against\nSt Mary's, the amazing 3-3 draw\nagainst the league champions, going\nout of the cup 4-3 due to a last minute\npenalty, piggy-backing Dave to the\nstation after the ball had hurt his\nankle, Loz's scrape with the law,\nGerman's scrapes with the referee,\nLoz Reed, Robo Ubogu, Andy Ferguson, Rob Finn, German Shanidze\nDave Wharton, Steve Fleming, Martin Archbald, Phil Siverns, Si Dunsby\n\"The Slags\" on their visit to Leicester, this time Felix Schroeder (far left)\nand Hajo Dekker (centre of group) turned up. Will and Steve K didn't.m ances off the field.\nThe season started badly, but the\nteam had the potential to do well - in\ngoal there was Steve K who's performances saved us time after time, an\nexperienced centre-back pairing of\nWill and Rob, a skillful midfield and\na deadly partnership up front of Alex\nand Martin \"Shearer\" Archbald.\nthe midfield, German \"killer\"\nShanidze who was our player of the\nyear due to his silky skills and bone-crunching tackles from centre-back\nand also Andy Ferguson who, despite\nbeing one of the shortest players on\nthe team, switched from midfield and\nfilled in admirably for Steve in goal.\nThe season was full of great mem-Goldies was brightened up by the referee pummelling one of his teammates and the game being abandoned. The state of Phil's eyeballs on\nSaturdays as he continued his four-way love thang with Margaret,\nDawn, Mary and Amy; Felix's amazing speed on the wing, Loz's constant hairstyle changes, Martin's that absolute **** who played for\nKings and was sent off, Hajo paying\nhis subs and my ridiculous methods\nof keeping my hair under control.\nIt was a season that we all enjoyed\nand although we didn't win much,\nwe were always the best-looking\nteam . All together now, \"In the town\nwhere I was born, lived a man who...\nSecond XI cricketers robbed in the cup\nThe day started badly with the\nminibus that we had booked having a flat battery. This delayed our de par ture, plus long tail-backs leaving\nLondon to the M4 meant that we\narrived at the secluded Royal\nHolloway sports ground just in time\nfor the start of the match.\nOur captain went out immediately\nto look at the perfect pitch. He also\nwon the toss in an Athertonesque\nmanner for the third time in a row.\nAfter losing our valiant captain in\nthe early overs, Mike and ImranKahn\nset about getting a decent score,\nwhile the rest of us sat in the sunshine\nattempting to get away from the\nbreeze which came direct from\nSiberia. Mike proves again that he is\nhard on bats as his third in five\ninnings bit the dust, but that didn't stop him clocking up a fluent 36.\nImran was joined at the crease by\nseveral other fine batsmen, but being\nthe senior partner he kept most of the\nstrike for a well-deserved 74. God\nknows what he would have got if he\ndidn't find the fielders with such reg-u lari ty. Graham successfully forecast his\ngolden duck right down to the catch\nat mid-on. Mikal made another\nextremely quick 12 in a way (and\nwith a bat) that only he can. The tail\nput on a few valued runs, with\nMandar hitting new highs in form\nsince starting to wear glasses, and\nended with 17 not out. All this\nsuperlative batting meant that we\nended with a record total of 208 for 9.\nBut was it going to be enough?\nTea was delivered by some fine\nyoung ladies and was taken outside\nin the sun. Tom, who had an emergency call-up for the match, managed to pout away a whole packet of\nJaffa cakes. The tea was marred by it\ncoming to light that three light-fin-ge red kids had been through the\nchanging rooms and had relieved us\nand our opposition of nearly \u00a3100\nand some watches.\nWe took the field and gained an\nearly breakthrough, but there was a lot of room for improvement in the\nfielding. Mandar was successful, in\npart at least, when attempting to\ncatch the ball that had been well and\ntruly leather ed at him in his mouth.\nThe story, again I'm afraid to say,\nwas all about dropped catches. Dave\nwas distraught in getting figures of 1\nfor 41, with his left arm spin totally\nbamboozling the opposition and giving five catches that were dropped.\nMandar was economical in his seven\novers for 30 odd runs. Mike was\nextremely pac y off his short run-up\nand was unlucky not to get more\nwickets, as were Pete and Moz. To\ntell the truth, I think almost everyone\nhad a chance dropped.This saw\nRoyal Holloway past our score with\nfour overs to spare.\nAfter the match, they were\nextremely hospitable and we went\nback to their Stubble Inn where we\nspent the evening. Half the team\nstayed on to sample their union and\nmore hospitality trying to score a few\nruns or bowling a maiden over. But\nfrom what I hear none were able to\neven hold a catch there.\nReport by Tweaker.\n\n"

The physicists and\nengineers have been looking in the wrong place by the way.\nThe substance with the lowest coefficient of friction is GoreTex and Karrimor roll-mats lubricated with about a gallon of\nwater. I only realised something was wrong when I felt myself\nsliding down past my friends who, from my point of view,\nappeared to be doing a gravity defying shuffle summit-wards. I levered myself upwards and set off towards the\nequipment store as, unwilling to leave the comfort of their\nb iv vy bags but more unwilling still to be washed several miles\ndown stream, the team participated in a surreal sack race in\nsearch of shelter.\nAs 16 people struggled to cram under the piece of blue\nplastic that also served to keep out food dry it was decided\nthat we would make the short walk up to the Neltner Refuge\nand try and stay in one-of their huts. Stuff was duly packed\nand we headed towards dryness and \"warmth. This was not\nto be. The irritatingly well-equipped French Expedition who \u201e\nwere camping near us had abandoned their space age tents'\nand had commandeered the dormitories. More choice insults\nflowed and, after questioning their parentage, describing\nexactly what diseases we ^thought their mothers had contracted and where, in some detail, they could place various bits of\nkit that were lying around, we regrouped and after much\nhaggling md n aged to hire a tepee off some of the Berbers\n\"(the local tribesmen) which slept 8 and accommodated the\nothers by stealing the French tents. The night passed slowly\nand cold. i1\"' The next morning (to use an overused but remarkably accurate clich e), dawned bright and clear. We breakfasted on\nrolled oats and nuclear strength coffee and settled back to\nwait for more supplies to arrive from the village below. We\nwaited. And waited. And decided that if the mules weren't here by 1pm then it was too late to start the next stage of out\ntrek; a, walk round the base of Jbel Toubkal via Lac D'l fn i.\\ fi\nAt about 2 in the afternoon a runner came up from Imlil.\nThe paths up here had been washed away and all the mules\nwere being used to cart corpses around. Hmm, not really a lot you can say to that. Our guide's farm had been washed\naway and all his animals were dead but he remained\nremarkably stoical. He explained in a broken'mixture of\nBerber, Arabic and French that the roads we had travelled up\non were, to put it lightly, no longer there and that were going\nto have to walk out of the valley. We made our way down to\nAroumd (pronounced Arempt) to stay the night there. I apologise in advance for using another clich e but the only word to\ndescribe the scene was total devastation. The lush green field\nwe had walked through a week earlier were gone and whole\nrows of houses were gone. Further down the mountain in the\nlarger Imlil cars were lying on their backhand in trees or had\nbeen crushed by 8ft boulders. The hotel we had been going\nto store our stuff in was gone leaving only the cellar. Even\nCNN were there. At that point we thought that if the media\nwere involved it might be a good idea to get a message back\nto England so two of the more energetic members of the\nteam set off to find a young doctor who was reputed to have\na mobile phone and the rest of us started to help rebuild the\ntown.\nThe walk out was uneventful.

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 6TH IUNE\nConfusion reigns in Southwell Hall shake-up\nJEREMY THOMSON After B five year delay, refurbishment\nof the ageing Evelyn Garden halls is\nonce again underway. The first to\nbenefit will be Southwell Hall, with\nhouse numbers 57 to 60 undergoing a major refit over the summer vacation\nand part way into next term.\nThe provisional plans include the\nremoval of two stairwells and several\ninternal walls, facilitating thirteen\nnew beds, thirty-five new showers,\nimproved kitchens and a laundry.\nThe plumbing and electrics will be\noverhauled, floors and ceilings\nrenewed and the exterior of the hall\nretouched. This will be achieved at\nthe expense of the old bathrooms and\nsome of the social areas, leaving just\none lounge for over ninety students.\nWork will commence in mid July\nand is likely to continue until\nNovember, necessitating temporary\naccommodation for the new first year\nstudents. At a recent meeting of the\nRector's Committee on Student\nResidences, plans were made to relocate the eighty-eight displaced students to Montpelier hall in\nKnightsbridge; the postgraduate hostel that was due for closure at the end\nof this academic year. Concerns have\nLong-overdue refurbishment awaits\nbeen raised about the poor quality of\nthese residences, and the cost of necessary repairs is so high that they\nwere due to be sold at the end of this\nacademic year. Complaints from current residents include unacceptably\nsmall rooms, poor plumbing and\npower cuts.\nDr Margaret Goodgame, student\ncouncillor, opined that \"the situation\nis not ideal\" but did not express any\nspecific objections to the plans. Ken\nYoung, who is both the Warden of\nSouthwell and a member of the\nestates team, agreed saying that \"we\nPHOTO: ROBIN an unsuspecting Southwell Hall.\nhave done and will continue to house\nstudents in worse accommodation\nthan [Montpelier hall]\", citing\nGarden Hall as an example. He also\ntold Felix that the displaced students\nwill only be expected to pay the\nlower Montpelier rent for their first\nterm. His main concern as Warden\nwas the splitting of the hall community for the crucial first few weeks\nand the difficulties of caring for students in a residence that will effectively be bisected next year.\nIt is currently unclear who will be\nresponsible for the students at\nMontpelier hall as current warden Dr\nRichard Clarke and his assistants\nwere expecting to be relieved of their\nposts this academic year. Recent\nattempts to recruit new wardens and\nsub-wardens have not proved very\nfruitful, and Dr Clarke may continue\nto serve Montpelier hall next term.\nAnother problem will be the loss\nof cheap student summer accommodation, popular with exchange students and those wishing to remain in\nLondon. The heavy building work is\nlikely to force the closure of neighbouring Holbein House as well as the\nrest of Southwell hall for an extended\nperiod. The Estates Division is hoping to complete the noisy work by the\nend of the summer to avoid disruption to students returning in the\nautumn.\nSharine Brown, Residences\nManager, also expressed regret that\nthe all work could not be completed\nin time for the fresher s' arrival in\nOctober. It is uncertain whether this\nwill be possible next year when the\nremaining parts of Southwell will be\nrebuilt.

On presentation of a student photo card, participants received\na third off the standard price of\nmonthly travelcards and bus basses.\nAlthough London Transport have\nmade it known that they were not satisfied with the results of the trial, the\nexact cause of discontent remains\nunclear. The University of London\nUnion Vice President of Welfare and\nRepresention, Paul Bates, said that it\nwas disappointing that UL U has, as\nyet, received no information from\nQ MW Student Union about the\nresults of the trial.\nThis lack of feedback has made it\ndifficult for UL U sabbaticals to continue campaigning for cheaper fares\nfor students, leaving them to face\ncontinued criticism and allegations\nof inaction from the Unions of the\nconstituent colleges that make up the\nUniversity of London.\nNew London authority\nEDWARD SHERMAN The new Government's plans for a 'strategic authority' for London have\nbecome a little clearer this week,\nwith the announcement that they\nexpect to hold a referendum on the\nsubject in May 1998. It is still\nunclear whether this plebiscite will\nallow Londoners to decide whether\nthe capital should have a directly\nelected Mayor or whether a single\nquestion will be posed.\nLabour's manifesto had promised\nto \"create a directly elected strategic\nauthority for London, with the consent of the people of London\", but\nminimal reference to this in the\nrecent Queen's Speech had caused\nconcern that this promise was of low\npriority to the Government. Two\nLondon MPs have questioned\nLabour's commitment to a policy\nwhich has wide support throughout\nthe city.\nReplying to a question from\nStephen Timms, a Labour backbencher and MP for East Ham, the\nDeputy Prime Minister, John\nPrescott, announced that he\n\"expect[s] that the new mayor and\nauthority will be elected in May\n2000\".\nWhilst this is later than many commentators had previously predicted,\na spokeswoman for the Department\nof the Environment, which is responsible for introducing the measures,\ninsisted that this is the earliest possible opportunity. With a consultative\ndocument setting forth Government\nproposals due by the end of July,\npaving legislation needed to hold the\nMay 1998 referendum is expected by\nNovember of this year. The substantive bill to set up the new authority\nwill then follow.\nNick Raynsford, Parliamentary\nUnder Secretary of State at the DOE\nand Minister for London, will be\nconsulting widely on the remit of the\nnew authority, together with its relationship with London's planned\nRegional Development Authority. It\nis unclear to whom the RDA will be\naccountable but according to the\nDepartment of the Environment it\nwill be responsible for \"economic\ndevelopment and regeneration.\"\nMany Londoners have felt that\nwith the political landscape moving\ntoward an acceptance of regional\nauthorities for Scotland, Wales and\npossibly Northern Ireland, the capital\nwould suffer a 'democratic deficit'\nfrom not having its own elected\nbody.\n\n"

The\nmoney had been accrued as part of a scheme to sell copies of mechanical\nengineering exam papers and tutorial\nsheets to students.\nThe meeting heard how the\nC& GU's top three, Mr Misra,\nHonourary Junior Treasurer Martin\nAyers and Honourary Secretary\nAndy Gilder, had taken on the task\nafter the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartmental Library refused to continue loaning papers to undergraduates. Though previously a free ser-vice, the copies available through the\nC& GU Office cost between \u00a315 and\n\u00a345 for a set of papers and worked\ntutorial sheets. Mr Misra defended\nthis pricing regime, saying that \"the\nstudents were getting a good service\"\nand that the exam paper packages\n\"involved a lot of photocopying\" by\nthe three officers.\nThe officers also came under\nattack concerning their practice of\nnot banking the proceeds of the exam\npaper sales, estimated at around\n\u00a33,000. Standard accounting practice\nfor clubs and societies, as outlined in\nICU's Finance Handbook, is to log\nall income and expenditure and forward cash and cheques to the Finance\nOffice to be banked. This malpractice\nmay also have VAT and NI implications. Some members of Council raised\nfears that the prices were extraordinary given that the service was for\nstudents. Indeed, profits on the sales\namounted to nearly \u00a31,000.\nNormally, money earned by the club\nthemselves and not part of their bud-get, known as 'self-generated\nincome' would be available for the\nclub to spend as they wished.\ncontinued on page two\nAmber light for JCR refurbishment\n/I NEWS TEAM College officials have this week\ngiven the go-ahead to a dramatic\nrefurbishment of the Junior Common\nRoom, due to begin in the summer of\n1998.\nPlans currently being drawn up by\nthe Estates Design Office include the\nremoval of most of the JCR wall\nadjoining the walkway and its\nreplacement with a curving glass\nscreen This new glass f as cia will be\nconcave, widening the walkway and\nallowing passers-by to see through\nthe JCR and out onto the Queen's lawn. STA Travel and the QT snack-bar will be relocated to either side of\nthe walkway entrance, both benefiting from a more prominent glass\nfrontage and a slight increase in floor\nspace. Within the JCR, a raised 'bar-rel vault' ceiling will attempt to\ninstill a sense of space, while an\nimaginative combination of\nimproved lighting and ventilation\nwill be employed to create a lighter,\nairier environment. Particular attention will be paid to the floor, the timber being re-polished and complemented by the use of brightly\ncoloured floor coverings.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 6TH JUNE COLUMNS 17\nPolitics is, as one of the great\nphilosophers once remarked, a funny\nold game. In the European arena,\nhowever, it is positively crazy. Last\nMonday, 1 found myself toasting the\nFrench Socialist victory with cham-p agne. Not perhaps the sort of behaviour that you, dear reader, expect of\nme. Reason? The Socialists in conjunction with the Communists (it's a mad, mad world) have just hammered I the last nail in the coffin of\nEuropean Monetary Union, and for\nthat we should be eternally grateful.\nThough never by any means a racing certainty, the French electorate\nhave ensured that we shall be spared\nfrom possibly one of most damaging\npolicies ever in Europe. It would\nappear that the only remaining exponents of EMU are Jacques Chirac\nand Helmut Kohl, whose enthusiasm\nfor the project remains completely\nundented by the bleed in' obvious.\nFor at least 18 months, it has been\npainfully apparent to almost everyone in Europe, save for these imperialistic zealots, that the imposed\ntimescale for a single currency was\nfanciful, and, more fundamentally,\nan idea with very questionable\npremises.\nNo country in Europe has moved\ntowards economic convergence by\nlegitimate means, with the possible\nexception of Britain, which has\nmoved towards the targets by coincidence. First we had the French pension fiddle with France Telecom,\nthen the various gold sales by the\nDutch and the ,\nSimon Baker\nWhat we have here is a classic example of the dangers of mixing politics\nwith economics. Kohl has effectively\nmade European federalism his life\nambition, to be pursued with vigour\nat all costs. The principal enabling\nstep for this is\nmonetary union;\nI political union,\n1 and make no misI take about this, is\nthe logical consequence. As EMU is the beginning\nand not the end,\nhe feels that it is\nvital that it starts\non time.\nObsession in\nmonetary policy is\nless than wise,\nM ranc' t'le Pur suan cc jE gL pJ of this policy\n\u2022\u2022- \u2022 -\u2014_ .\u2014 mS mm oblivious to the\nvoice of reason broader Eur \u00b0 pe an economic picture\nis highly irresponsible. It has had two\nconsequences. Firstly, France and\nGermany have had to apply the fiscal\nbrakes at precisely the time that a loosening of policy was called for at\nthe end of the recession, with the\nsubsequent high level of continental\nunemployment. Secondly, and as a Belgians. Space does\nnot permit to\nlist the\naccountancy\nshenanigans\nof the Italians.\nThe latest and\nmost serious\nfudge is, of\ncourse, the\nplanned revaluation of\nGerman gold\nreserves, succ es sfu11 y vetoed by the\nBundesbank\nPresident. Quite how Germany can legitimately\nmeet the economic convergence\nterms that it insisted were included in\nthe Maastricht treaty is anybody's guess, for by ensuring stricter monetary union, it has all but guaranteed\nits absence from the process. No\nGermany, no EMU.\nresult of the pain of real efforts to\nmove to convergence, governments\ncross Europe have little choice but to\ncook the books to flatter the figures.\nThis has little immediate consequence, but a Euro built on such\nshaky foundations will be savaged\nby the markets, inevitably driving\ninflation up. Anyone who thinks that\nthe historical strength of the\nDeutschmark will be preserved in the\nnew currency either attended the\nDennis Healey School of Economics\nor answers to the name of Helmut.\nThe Times Higher Education League\nTable has caused much interest in\nhere placing us third, principally on\naccount of First, books and beds. Our\npre-eminence over the LSE is secure,\nbut in other aspects, they are giving\nus a real run for our money. A recent\n1st year Computing exam was conveniently supplied with the exam in er's marking guide, rendering the\nexam simple even for LSE students.\nAre s it has now been rescheduled on\na day after most of the overseas candidates have flown home. If the late\nres it is due to a lack of facilities, I think Imperial should do its duty and\noffer our own first-class exam centre j to our University of London col-!\nleagues.\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nWhen President Clinton\nvisited the new Prime\nMinister and toured\nround London last week,\nhe was very envious of\nthe speed with which the\nnew Government came in, and the power it enjoys.\nIn the States, laws are passed by Congress, and a two-thirds majority overrides a presidential veto.\nAn American President is always negotiating with\nCongress on policy and law. We have no such\nproblems here. Britain is essentially an 'elective\ndictatorship', where the Government has in effect\nabsolute power to direct policy and law for five\nyears, after which the public make their choice for\nanother five years. Such power has come under\ncriticism, with commentators saying that we suffer\nfrom a democratic deficit. Our only other voting\npowers lie in electing local councillors and\nMembers of the European Parliament, whose\npower pales into insignificance compared with the\nBritish Parliament.\nThe Conservatives did nothing to improve the\nsituation: Mrs Thatcher embarked on a centralisation of power that many socialists could only have\ndreamed of, turning many local councils into talking shops and administrators of services rather than\ndirectly elected bodies who could affect their terri-tory. Mr Blair is making some welcome changes\nto this policy, including devolving power to run\nlocal affairs to Wales and Scotland, although the\nvacillating and woolly implementation of the policy has plenty left to be desired. The long-promised\nintroduction of a Freedom of Information Act was\nnot - as promised - in the Queen's Speech but the\noutcry this provoked as accelerated the timetable\nfor its arrival on the statute books. Let us hope that\nthe Government does not get too used to the culture of secrecy for this to be delayed any longer.\nThe final part of the new policy of opening the\nworkings of the Government to scrutiny comes\nwith the Bill of Rights, which involves the incorporation of the charter of the European Court of\nHuman Rights into British Law, so citizens will be\nable to get redress within British courts rather than\nhave to appeal to Strasbourg. The Bill of Rights\nwill not go as far as the American model where\nentire Acts can be struck down by a judge. This is\nexpected to be the best compromise available, as\nthe Government does not want to go too far down\nthis road: in the States the death penalty was abolished and later reinstated purely by decisions from\nthe US Supreme Court - Congress was not con-sul ted. Set against this happy picture of our\nGovernment handing some of its awesome power\nout some worrying signs have emerged. Firstly the\nalterations to the workings of Parliament made by\nthe Government - decisions that should be the preserve of Parliament itself. Secondly the use of the\n'guillotine' on. the devolution debates which\nwrecked the Opposition's attempts to bring the\nGovernment's flabby devolution policy to account.\nThis broke with previous convention that matters\nof the Constitution would be discussed at length on\nthe floor of the House. This guillotine motion\nbrought the debate to an end and precipitated a vote - which the Government cruised through\n(something that will be very familiar during the\nnext five years). Donald Dewar -accused the\nOpposition of \"an organised attempt to obstruct\"\nthe legislation, a particularly arrogant comment\ngiven that it is the duty of the Opposition to do\nexactly that if they are unhappy with it.\nThe last, and most worrying aspect of the\nGovernment's new regime is the plethora of political appointees holding powerful positions in\nGovernment. There are now 35 such people\nemployed in Government departments, with more\npromised, compared with 30 during the 18 years of|\nConservative Government. Although some, especially in the DTI and Treasury, have considerable\nrelevant experience, the majority have experience\nonly of campaigns and party politics. This goes\nagainst the Civil Service principle of positions\nbeing available by 'free and fair competition', and\nthe appointments required a rare Order in Council\nfor them to wield power over civil servants. The\nfinal straw was the predicted appointment of Mr\nBlair's 'Chief of Staff, Jonathan Powell, to be his\nParliamentary Private Secretary, to which the\nCabinet Secretary voiced his concerned opp osi tion, given that the PPS deals with documents of|\nnational security. The appointment was finally\ngiven to civil servant.\nThe incumbent Government is keeping faithful\nly to its manifesto of openness and honesty, but the\npolitic is ation of the Civil Service is a foreboding\nsign. Although most of the signs are optimistic\nthey must ensure they don't go down the well-worn path of keeping the levers of power too close\nto the chest.\n\n"

At King's a film\nsociety occasionally shows films; the\ndrama group have to hire the theatre\nfrom the college in order to use it;\ntheir monthly newspaper features\nabout as much blank space as it does\ninteresting writing; and those trying\nto organise society s are given a minimum of assistance. Here we (oops,\nsorry you) have a newspaper the students actually want to read, a radio-station, a cinema, a very nicely\nequipped resources room for clubs\nand societies, and if Dramsoc's current production of Romeo and Juliet\nhas been rehearsed on stairwells, outside the Royal Albert Hall, and in the\nSherfield Ante-Room - at a cost of\n\u00a325 a go, at least we have a venue to\nperform it in.\nHopefully the candidates this time\nround really want to run this union.\nThey need to, because the most\nimportant issue which they'll have to\ndeal with - apart from the Mary's merger - is getting the college to\nrealise the union is not an extra, but a vital part of their service to students\nat I.C. and one they should be proud\nof. Incidentally - why such a fuss\nabout Mary's moving over here - its\nlike any small company or nation\nbeing amalgamated with a larger\none. The most important traditions,\nthe cultural identity of the small unit\nwill be maintained as far as the members of that unit wish, whilst the individuals will benefit from the greater\nrange of choice offered by the larger\norganisation. Financial battles will be\nfought with some bloodshed on both\nsides - but it is an inevitable process.\nBack to the point - the President's chief responsibility is to persuade\ncollege to take the funding of the\nunion seriously - instead of supporting only the high-culture activities,\nsuch as Orchestra and Choir, and the\nhigh-achieving sports teams such as\nfencing. Apparently there are people\nemployed within college to support\nstaff-student relations. Will any of\nthem be attending Romeo and Juliet\nbeing performed in the Union\nConcert Hall - do they ever go to the\ncinema - or out to cheer on a hockey\nteam. Do they take our social activities seriously at all? If they do not we\nought to be outraged.\nExcept, of course, its our own\nfault. How can anyone expect to be\ntaken seriously when Hustings for\nsabbatical elections consist of forcing candidates to down pints to prove\ntheir \"manhood?\". Drinking capacity\nis seen as superior to policy - why\nshould anyone take that seriously.\nIn case anybody is wondering\nwhether this is mostly an excuse for a Dramsoc plug - I 've just submitted\nan application to become a Life\nmember of the Union. And if I'd wanted to write a plug, I'd have put:\nDear Felix, Look out for people\nfighting with staves in the Quad next\nweek, they're demonstrating\nsequences from Romeo and Juliet,\nwhich runs from 11th14 th June in\nthe Concert Hall.

The article is entitled \"Dustbin of the World\" and concludes with a sent ance that equates\nBritish universities with dustbins.\nHow readily I agree with his comments on the ey sores of tatty posters\nand crushed coke cans but must point\nout that the entrance foyer of\nElectrical and Electronic\nEngineering where Professor\nAleksander was head for 8 years, is\none of the least attractive locations\non campus, rating not much above\nthe JCR. If we wish to cr eat\" enthusiastic and curious students and faculty members\" then an entrance\nfoyer which inspires those who enter\nit may well be as important as finding\nthe funding for more research.\nYours,\nPaolo Cuomo EE2.\nIt's not a particularly good ad for\nIC either...\nDear Felix,\nJust to put the record straight,\nregarding last Friday, and the\nUnion's position with licences. As\nyou are aware, the Union currently\nobtains its bar extensions by means\nof Special Order Exemptions - which\nmeans that we must apply for each\nextension individually. Last Friday,\nthe local licencing authority decided\nnot to grant an extension, a decision\nwhich is entirely at their discretion.\nHowever, before we are all thrown\ninto panic, the licences for the\nremaining events have now been\ngranted.\nAt present, the Union is in the\nprocess of applying for a \"Section\n77\" licence which will allow us to\nperm a ment ly maintain our current\nmidnight licence on Wednesday and\nlam on Fridays, without making\nindividual applications. We hope to\nhave this in place for Freshers'\nWeek.\nHowever, we require the co-opera-tion of everyone that attends Union\nevents before we can expect this\napplication to be granted. One of the\nmajor objections against our licence\nis the noise after Friday nights, and\nwe have promised local residents that\nthe noise will be reduced. We need\nyour help - it will only take a few\nobjections for our licence to be\nremoved, and we will not be able to\nopen past 11pm. The Union has invested a great\ndeal of time and money in gaining a licence - we do not want to lose it\nbecause of the poor behavior of a small handful. Please respect the\nneeds of our neighbours.\nYours,\nMark Home, Events Manager.\nFeeling artistic?...Up For a challenge?\nDue to insurmountable problems Leosoc (your college\nsociety for drawing and painting) has been unable to run\nthis year but intends to be fully functional for next year.\nTo do this we need your help\nThose of us still involved with Leosoc are either leaving\nnext year or are too busy to run the society.

One\nproposal under consideration is that\nan 'intermediate' set of new tables\nand chairs be purchased for next\nyear, and then be retired after one\nyear to replace the furniture of a similarly poor quality in Southside upper\nlounge.\nIt is likely that a majority of IC students will welcome any improvement to the JCR, which has not seen\nany significant renovations since the\nearly 1980's. It is hoped that the\nrefurbishment will go some way in\naddressing the general gloominess of\nboth the JCR and the walkway, the\nisolation and identity crisis of QT\nand the lack of any provision or toilets for the disabled. As can be seen,\nthe renewed JCR will closely resemble other recent projects by the\nEstates Design Office, such as the\ndB's venue and, to a lesser extent, the\nnew Union Shop.\nThe relocation of QT is interpreted\nby some as a further move towards\ncreating a 'student services shopping\nmail' along the Sherfield walkway,\nwhich might conceivably be expanded beyond its current constituency of\nthe JCR, STA Travel, ICU\nNewsagents, ICU Shop and the\nNatWest cash-point.\nAlthough a general improvement\nof student services is undoubtedly\nthe College's intention, questions\nremain as to who might be permitted\nto run any new services, where the\nprofits might go and whether the\nexpansion of QT and STA will mean\nless seating and social space for JCR\npatrons.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 6TH IUNE PRESIDENTIAL MANIFESTOES 7\nId are say by this point you have a fair idea about what New Election\nentails, but for those of you who\nspent the last few months flying\nbehind Halley-Bopp here's a quick summary.\nIf you think none of the candidates standing in the election are\ncapable of doing the job at all (!)\nthen vote New Election to force\nanother ballot. Nominations for\nthe posts will be re-opened and a fresh round of elections will take\nplace, though this will have to be\nnext year due to the timescale of\nthings (so think, before you vote).\nYou can also use New Election\ntactically (say as your third\nchoice) to differentiate between)\nwhich candidates you do think are\nworth the post, and which aren't. Remember that due to the wonderful nature of the Single\nTransferable Vote System your\npreferences count, as well as just\nyour first choices.\nI consider the issue of private accommodation to be a high priority. At present the Union is 'pressuring' College into a more effective system of vetting landlords. Knowing the legendary speed with which Sherfield moves\nin such situations, I propose to create an 'unofficial' landlord blacklist that\nwould be available from the Union.\nThe St. Mary's merger is a contentious issue. I believe that duplicated\nclubs or societies should be encouraged to merge, but I feel the actual decision over merger should be at the discretion of the members and organisers\nof any such clubs.\nI would take a firm stand against any 'inconsiderate' behaviour towards\nstudents by the College, e.g. The Marquee in Princes Gardens. I would not\nstand by doing nothing, stating that the College was already embarrassed\nenough.\nI believe that no matter how much work is done by the President and the\nUnion, this work would be infinitely more valuable if he/she is seen to be\ndoing it. I believe in a more accessible administration, where the movements\nand actions of said administration are more widely available.\nI would also like to see a more streamlined and efficient administration of\nthe Union.\n!\nLaurie Tweedale\nAfter three years here, my involvement in all aspects of the Operatic Society\nand experience as a dedicated Hall Re-App have lead me to believe that fairness and equality are essential.\nRepresentation\nAwareness - Only through continuous and consistent communication will\nstudents take a more active role in the Union and feel welcome to contribute.\nAcademic Affairs - The reason for us all being here. The current system\nneeds to be improved; students don't know their representatives or whom to\ncomplain to.\nParticipation - Every registered student is eligible to vote, but the present\nunion card system doesn't allow this. I will develop a system to allow ALL students to participate.\nFacilities\nBeit Quad struggles to provide for the current South Kensington population - Friday nights regularly sell out and clubs&societies are reduced to\nmeeting in the Quad. DaVinci's and the JCR are packed out in the daily fight\nfor lunch. We need to gain as much space as possible.\nMedical Merger\nWe must endeavour to involve all students on the St. Mary's and Charing\nCross sites. Similar clubs should be encouraged to meet and discuss how\nthey could benefit by pooling resources or supporting activities spread across\nall sites.\nVoting: 16th17 th June, in all departments. You will need your union card to vote.\n\n"
