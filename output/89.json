There are about ISO\nprints on show and quite a number of colour transparencies\nOf these about 90 prints are\nbeing sent to the U.I. TJ.\nExhibition.\nMost of the photographs were\nentered in the Photo. Soc.\nCompetition which was judged\nvery competently by Mr.R.S. Wood\nA. R.P.S. Thirty-four members of the Society entered\nthe competition. Mr.R. Wood (not the judge) won the\nPictorial section with a fine church study called\n\"Peace*. Mr.G. Matthews'led the Portraiture section\nwith a well composed photograph of a violinist. The College Activities section was won by Mr.A. Eyoott who exhibited\" his advert is ment for \"The\nLady's not for Burning\" which included some fine\nportraits of the actors. Mr.Eycott also took first and,second p rises in the Record section. Mr.J.K. Taylor won the Colour Print section through lack\nof competition, but this does not reflect on the\nquality of his prints. Mr.B.R.P. Cook swept the\nboard in the Colour Transparency section winning\nall three prizes.\nOn the whole the prints hung where of good quality,\nthough in some cases the photographer had difficulty in getting enough depth of focus. But in one or two\nInstances the mounting left much to be desired.\nDr.Glaister loaned four of his prints, and Dr.\nHaywood some excellent colour transparencies to\nshow what our elders can do.\nOn Monday evening after the Judge had given a commentary on the exhibits the first Annual Dinner\nof the Society was held. Prom the speeches given\nafter the dinner I gathered the deplorable fact\nthat although the Society has a record membership\nof 180 this year only 7 or 8 people, including\ncommittee members, turn up to talks given by outside\nexperts, and into which a lot of work has been put.\nThe prizes were presented by Mr.Wood, the Glaister\nShield going to Mr.R.iTo od for the best print in the\ncompetition, and the newly awarded Ruthen Cup to\nMr.Matthews for the best portrait. General Studies Debate\nREPORT ON DEBATE: TUESDAY 28TH FEB.\nIn view of the gradual decline in attendance\nat General Studies lectures, the Lit.& Deb. Soc.\ndebated the motion that \"This house condemns\nGeneral Studies\". As was pointed out, an v one who\nreally condemned them was unlikely to be present,\nsince the debate was held under the auspices of\nGeneral Studies. This suggestion was substantiated by Dr. Cohen and Mr. Wright, pro oo sing, who took a ii ne of constructive criticism of the\npre s net arrangements. The House Being largely\nagreed, the debate took on a light-hearted character and we were treated to a touching picture\nof Dr. Allan and Dr. Cohen indulging in innocent\npleasure reading a Greek book together. In his'\namusing but sincere speech Dr. Allan expressed\nconcern at the lack of broad cultural interest in Imperial College. He ventured to blame our founders for this as they had planned I.C. as at rai ning school for narrow minded scientists, and tech-nic ian s; also, ours being a largely non-resident-i al college, we lose the opportunity of discussing\nthe unsolved problems of life until two in the\nmorning, which is an important part of a university education.\nSeveral suggestions for improvements in the\nGeneral Studies programme were made from the floor but the iroh i em of arousing the interest of students who never or but rarely attended General\nStudies lectures was not seriously cons i* ere<T. The motion was heavily defeated\".\nLITERATURE\nTheSnrine; edition of \"ho eni appeared to have lees mater\ni al in it then usual on res\nlag the \u00bb>reefs, but the number of paces was the same.\nPerhaps tie larger n amber o. Illustrations' by Tony Ball contributed to this, bat it ie probably the nature of thi\narticles which gives rise to this impression. The:\nare all immensely readable. In fact they are\nentertaining, and none ef them is long enough to be loft half read, and give the usual lar press ion of en cycle pae dia ical bulk to the reader.\nIf one acknowledges that the review* of club\nactivities are included solely for record mtr noses then there is no reason for being disappointed\nwith this edition, and the lighter character of\nthe included material makes a pleasant relief from the esoteric articles of previous issues.\nDRAMA\nThe Imperial College\nDramatic Society, being\nhandicapped by lack of a stage\nfor their productions, lent\nfull support to the University\nUnion's recent production of Dispersal.\nThe Society provided none\nof the leading actors, but\n.several members n laye d sub sid ary roles very effectively. It was\nbehind the stage that most of\nthe I.C, effort was directed, and is usual they\napplied their scientific knowledge to overcome\nmost of the limitations that they encountered.\nDuring the last two years the Jazz Club has\nonce again been established as a going concern\nafter being on the verge of extinction. With the formation this year of the I.C. Jazz\nBand the Club can now be considered on par with\nthose of rival colleges. Under the leadership of\nTerry McVeigh the band made its debut at the jazz\nhop held last term and now regularly makes appearances at college hops and carnivals.\nSix lunch-time record recitals have already\nbeen given this term, including one by Johnny\nParker, Humphrey Lyttelton's pianist. As in the\npast, the traditionalists seem to far outnumber\nthe modernist members of the club. Efforts by\nsecretary Howard Williams to remedy this have not\nmet with much success. Nevertheless the impending\nvisit of Stan Kenton to the Albert Hall may yet\nstimulate more interest in the modern forms of\nj as z. Jazz at the college shows a definite up trend\nthis year, and the large numbers attending the\nJive classes is a very healthy sign.\nTHE DRAMATIC a MUSICAL SOCIETIES INVITE YOU TO AYRTOK HALL FOR.\nVICTOR!

Challenge Cup goes each wear to the\ncost it u ent College which gains most points in the\ninter-College championships. Since the war, the\ncontest has been held eight times, and each time\nit has been won by the Mines beating the Guilds.\nThe boxing this year was of a higher standard\nthan last years, and although arms drooped in a few cases towards the end of bouts, the boxers\nwere generally very fit. This is remarkable\nconsidering the difficulties of training with\nonly an apology for a gymnasium.\nThe outclassed boxers had their bouts stopped\nin the first rounds, but they all displayed\nenthusiasm even if the didn't know which foot\nthey should have forward.\nThe judges awarded Robin Appleby a tankard\nas winner of the best bout of the evening when he\nfought Baker in the semi-final of the middleweight class.\nPeter Kale resting after being floored \"oy\nGordon Green in the heavy weight final. ROWING On Saturday, March 3r d.,I.C. showed its rowing superiority over Heading University. The I.C. Seoond VTJI, substituting for the first VHI, incapacitated due to flu,\nrowed a very good race to beat the heavier Heading First v TH by li lengths. This Reading are w hag recently beaten the\nfirst Tin's of both Bri3tol and 3Bath hampton. The I.C \"old lags\" crew, which is mainly composed of\nex-l st. VHtman who are not devoting all their energies to\nrowing this year, rowed a very good rao e with Heading 2nd. VHI to be beaten by 6ft. in the last 50 yd s. of the rao e. Fitness tells 1 The 3rd. and 4th. Tin's both racing in\nQuaker boats raced vary^well to beat their op po's Ik y$L> end j L. respectively.\nThe day reflected the present strength of the club and we\nmay we li expect pleasing results in the Tideway Head of the\nElver to be held an March 24th, Rugger Cup Semi - Final\nI.C.l l pts.: Wye College nil.I. C. reached the final of the U.L. Cup for the\nfourth time in five years, after a very hard semi-final game against Wye College. The score of 11-0\nbelies the dour ness of the game, since it was only\nin the closing stages that I.C. dominated the field. Winning the toss, I.C. had first benefit of\na moderate wind at their backs, and started with a period of mild pressure. From the early scrum sI.C. gained the ball more often than not, but the heeling was slow, and the backs had little opportunity\nto show their speed. The Wye forwards were very\nlively in the loose and persistently smothered the\nI.C. halves before they could get the ball moving.\nThe scoring efforts in the first half were limited and consisted of a few long shots at goal from pena l ties. Jones touched down by the post only to be\npenal is ed for obstruction.\nKale went off10 minutes before half-time,\nwith head injuries, due in part to the previous\nevening's boxing, and did not return until just before the end of the game.\nIn the second half I.C., with their seven for-wards, pressed hard, and went close to scoring more\nthan once. Eventually, after a period of strong\npressure, Hearn broke through on the blind side to\ninitiate a Fitzpatrick-Jones-Stone passing movement which brought a hard-earned try. Wye came back into the fight, and one three-quarter movement looked very dangerous but was succ ess fully smothered. In the last ten minutes T.C. were completely on top and scored two tries, the\nfirst by Hearn, who\"went through from 35 yards and\nbrushed aside four or five tackles before scoring\nbetween the posts} he also converted. In the clo sing minutes Doncaster pounced on a loose ball in typical style and scored.\nI.C. won because their forwards were better\nin the tight and o laye d well in the loose, in the\nsecond half, and also because eventually the backs\ngot moving together. However, the team as a whole\nis very slow in starting, and frequently the backs,\nin their anxiety to get at their man, do not keep\na straight line in defence- which nay one day be\ntheir undoing,\nI.C. have reached the Final now, scoring 57\npoints in three games and conceding none. The Final is at Motspur Park on March 17th,, and our opponents are U.C. PLEASE COME AND GIVE US THE SUPPORT '\nA' E NEED.\nHYDE PARK ROAD RELAY\nOn Saturday, Feb. 25th., due to a vast amount of work by\nChas, Cotterill, I.C. staged its biggest athletic event of the\nje\u00abX the Road Relay in Hyde Park.\n^for those who did not see the race we present an account\nof I.C.'s progress through the six laps.\nMellor ran the first lag - always a nerve-racking task\nand finished 13th. in the very good time of 14 min. 14 sees.\nHe handed over to Wall, whose light build and track training\nenabled him to pull up to tenth place in 14 - 19.\nThe I.C. Captain, Ansell, ran the the third log. \"fi th \u00bb recently o ji lei tendon not quite healed, he managed to pull\nup another place, and returned a time of 14 - 40. Collins, on\nthe fourth lap, gained another two places b;' his characteristic speeding-up half way round, finishing 7th.in1422. Fain, an the fifth leg, lost no time in chasing the man in front, and turned in1349, which put I.C. in 6th. position.\nCotterill, on the last leg valiantly tried to catch Heywood,\nof Reading, but the gap was too j z re at. With his excellent time\nof 13-22 (the fourth best of the day) I.C.'s total amounted\nto 84-46, which gave us sixth position in a total field of\nthirty.\nrtl Nl s had by FELIX BOARD, Imperial Colhp Union, London, S.W.7.

Doubting greatly his,\n\u2022ability to pass 1st. year chemistry, he applied for a place\nin the Botany Department, where he was told to come bao k in two years. Len thereupon joined the R \u00bbA.F,, where he\nreached the semi-finals of the boxing championships by\nfive consecutive knockouts.\nOn returning to I.C. he tried to arouse some interest\nin boxing, and has oe rta in ly succeeded. Len is at present\ncaptain of both 1.0, and U.L. boxing, and has recently\nimmortalized himself by winning the U. A.U. featherweight\nchampionship - although he is a bantam-weight. Besides\nboxing he enjoys rugby, golf, and sculling. He is\nparticularly anxious to see a permanent P.T. instructor\nin the new gym, so that I.C.'s physical standards\nmight improve.\nLen confesses to two strong dislikes - people who\nslam doors late at night, and super-sophisticated\nwoman who smoke in public.\nPROFILES\nSMS JOCKS\nBans in Farm i a193334* tea want to school in Dumfries &\nxy nm cut h, and was not noted for\nhis scholastic abilities.

In the main competition, surprises were\no a used in the semi-finals when_ R. CS. 'A' were defeated by\nR.C.S.' B' and Guild's suffered the same fate against their\n\u2022B' team.

Union Mating, the Uniea\nvoted tar 888 votes to 252 against applying far\nre a ff lli atl on to the National Union of Students.\nThe voting was arranged such that a number who\nwould otherwise abstained but remained in the\n\u2022eating were included among the voters against\nthe motion. No announcement was made that the\nabstainers should leave, and no count of abstainers\nwas taken. Also it has been admitted that the\ntellers of the votes against the motion did not\ncome to agreement.\nIn view of these facts it is widely felt that the results should be declared null and void,\nand that a secret ballot should be held to decide\nthis important issue. We feel that better arrangements for the conduct of future Union meetings\nshould be made to prevent the recurrence of this and the premature ending of the meeting in chaos.\nYours etc.,\nC.J.

It was stated quite definitely before a vote was taken what people in ei oh roo l were voting for and , indeed 8 abstentions -w re recorded in the corridor between the two r?

The motion was defeated by a small but\ndecisive majority and the result can in no way be\ndeclared null and void.\nI.C. Union,\nDear Sir,I feel that I must criticise your editorial of the last issue of \"FELIX\", on the grounds that\nit is both misleading and, to this Society, insulting. This Society arranged the entertainment\noffered to the two American debaters and if your\nEditorial is to be believed I have \"an axe to grind.\" I would suggest in fact that I haven'tt\nthe debaters on the first day of their short stay\nwere entertained to lunch, shown round London and\ntaken to\" dinner in Hall, and on the following day\nshown a little more of London. I believe that they\nenjoyed all of these things. Could the Union have\ndone more? Short of rig our ou sly controlling every\nminute of the Americans' time the Union would\nhave had no more power than myself to stop them\nmeeting \"axe-grinders\" and in general being baited.\nThis pre-supports that they did meet \"axe-grinders\" and were baited, each of these to such\na degree that they \" left Imperial with the impression that it was a hot bed of communist agitators;\"\nsince the Americans met only one Communist to the\nbest of my knowledge, this is to say the least\nsurprising. I would point out tee. that for nearly\nthe whole of their stay they considered this particular communist a very pleasant chap and were\nsomewhat amused and amazed at the same time at\nhis beliefs. If they eventually tired of .his\nconstant talk of politics they did no more than\nI and many others did long age, and I am sure\nthey were not so foolish as to take his opinion\nas that of Imperials' as your Editorial claims.\nNo sir.I insist the hospitality offered\nby this Society was true hospitality; we arranged\nfor the Americans to debate here and as such\nconsidered it our place to entertain them and net\ntrouble the Union as a whole.

Union meetings of recent years.\nThe attendance was a record, and Room 17\nin Guilds rivalled the Black Hole of\nCalcutta. The meeting was due to start at 1.15 p.m., but by 1 o 'clock the back\nof the room was almost filled by the\nusual rowdy elements. Mr. Cox planted\nale pk( it being St. David's Day) against\nthe blackboard. The President on arrival re planted the vegetable in front of\nhim on the bench despite cries of \"eat\nit\". Herbert appeared soon after and\nwas greeted with approval though it was\nprobably the first time any of the first year men had seen the Imperial Col leg e Mascot\nThe meeting opened, and Mr. Kitchener disposed of the minutes of the last meeting in almost vulgar haste. Under\nMatters Arising, Mr. Ibbotson rose to\nsay that on several occasions recently\nhe had been frustrated. He got no fur ther with audible speech and the Union\nput it down to the process of growing\nup.

This had sa^-ed King's a lot of\ntrouble because they had intended to o paint him anyway and now only needed to\na pn iy a top coat. The Uni in expressed\nits contempt at such a weak excuse by\nreceiving the announcement in complete\nsilence.\nThe next item on the agenda was\nGrants. The Council had taken act i in\non the motion by Messrs. Walnole.and\nDavies passed at the previous meeting.\nAmong other things, they had ir ovid ed the opportunity for individual students\nto have their cases of inadequate grants\ntaken up, Mr. Anderson had v/r it ten a letter to FELIX informing the college of\nthe arrangements. Not one person had\ntaken advantage of tl ese and though they\nwere still open, the value of Mr. Walnole's notion had been over-estimated*\nThen came the crucial \u00bbo in tin the\nmeeting - the debate on a motion from Mr.\nJohn Cox, seconded by a Fred Snriggs.\ntV as the college to re affiliate to NU.S.?

This word c roDs up in many magazines and especially student journals and papers. It is probably a sign of the times that people like to be\npampered, and they expect the age of automatons to\nlead to an even easier life. Perhaps the Welfare\nstate has had its influence in bringing people to\nthe condition where' they consider that others have\nan obligation to look after their various necessities\nand toe entertain them\nAt the last I.e. general meeting ot seemed that\napathy a i a not a Do undina third of the students.\nAdmittedly it was x those that felt strongly about a cert a 'in Issue who were present, but that they endured\nthe overcrowding to record their opinions o by i at es the accusing finger being thrust at them.\nPerhaps while this spirit prevails it would be a good- opportunity to s ugc est 'that opinions can be expressed in the College Journal and Newspaper. Indeed,\nFELIX hopes to cover a series of controversial\nsubjects next term, but the need of PHOENIX *bg reu tei at present.\nAny people with ideas are urged to send the tt to the\nEditor of that Journal,who will give cd vio e if the\nindividual does not feel sufficiently well endowed with\nliterary talent himself.\nI. C.W. A. DANCE\nI. C.W. A. held their JSnual Dinner and Dance on Friday,\nMarch 2nd. The Guest of Honour this year was Miss Margaret\nPopham, Ex-headmistress of Cheltenham Ladies College.\nAn excellent dinner was followed by sd rae most entertaining\nspeeches. I*r. Atkinson,in proposing the Association, illustrated his amusing remarks with drawings of Mark 1 and \".ark 11\nIcwarians. I 'embers of the Association were relieved to find\nthese two extremes. In reply,.Hiss Maureen Hawes outlined\nthe activities of I. C.W. A. during the past year and expressed\nthe hope that future years would show a considerable increase\nin the size of the Association. From Miss Paddy Clarke's remarks it was-concluded that i the guests were of the highest\ncalibre; Miss Margaret Popham expressed relief in finding\nthat women scientists were more versatile and decorative\nUlan she had been led to believe.\nDancing followed to music provided by the Clubnen\nQuartet, and it was generally agreed that the evening was a great success.\nSquare Dancing\nAlthough the strains of music frequently emanate from\nthe Ayrton Hall, on Wednesday 29th February, when the\nConservative Society held its Square Dance, the Tempo was\nchanged. A team of Young Conservative dancers entering to\ntheir signature tune \"Cracking Corn\" gave a short demonstration and immediately followed by inviting everyone to\njoin them on the floor.\nThe team,with tireless energy, assisted by the caller,\nhad no difficulty in teaching the dancers of the eight sets\nwho thronged the floor.\nThe dances varied 1>om the Traditional American style\nto \"The Square Dance Jitterbug\" 0 f doubtful origin.\nThe venture was a great success and it is to be hoped\nthat a similar function will be held in the near future.\nPRESENTED ST WEST FJ EL Q GO UE GE THE MASTER BUILDER\" BY U EN RIK IBSEN THUR S. MARCH15*730. ADMISSION\nIX' P.M. TJt THB NEWS: Almost every, day, refer e noes to technological training or to I.C. in parti ou lar, are to be found in\nthe press. The oom ment s of outsiders on our problems are\nfrequently unusual enough to be very thought-provoking.\nNorman Fisher in the Observer: \" mathematics, in d is pensi ble to so ie no e, is not only un congenial but exceedingly difficult\nto many intelligent children\" (converse?); and again: \"When\ntechnical students are allowed to enter their examination\nrooms carrying reference books, the auspices for their\ngeneral education will become far more favourable.\" The\narticle subsequently refutes the argument that science\nprovides just as good an intellectual discipline as arts and\nstates that \"scientists have \"become increasingly incomprehensible even to one another.\" Nevertheless, economists\nrarely oom e under fire for having a narrow intellectual\ntraining. In the \"Sunday Times\", Sir John Simon goes to\nlengths to differentiate between technologists and technicians, while controversy rages here, as in the \"Manchester\nGuardian\" over the demolition of the pr ioe less relic\nknown as Collieutt Building. Meanwhile we sit and wait or\nsit and work for the June exams.\nFQK.'AL DINNERS Inadvertently entering the bar for a quiet drink about 7 o'c look, I have recently been embarrassed\nby the presence of crowds of spend idly arrayed students\ntrying to buy as many sherries as possible for others, while\nthe rest of us argue about who is to buy the next round of\nhalf bitters. I have frequently pondered: Who is out of\nplace? and: Is this the Public or the Saloon Bar? Alas with\nthe loss of our proletarian symbol, the dartboard, I feel\nlittle confidence and trot round to the Queen. But evening\ndress or no evening d^ ess, you must not miss last flail Dinner\nof the term; borrow the girl-friend's tartan skirt - nobody\nquite* knows what' constitutes Highland evening dress.\nA HEP OP SPORT (As Andy Levine said recently) Work on\nthe R.O.S. Carnival \"Night Time with Neptune\" has been underway since the Mines' Carnival. Larger than ever flats,\ndesigned by Vase Atkinson, will provide the background, and\nthere will presumably be the usual s noggin g facilities\nbehind the background.\nFICK3D TIP. CHgAtOii 7e welcome the appearance of new\nlines in the Snack #ar confectionery but the box bearing the\nlegend \"Carnival tart\" ought to be smothered in jam or something\n^lain $ane thinks\nJane regrets that she is not going to continue with the\nexamination of I.C. men begun in the last issue. She is fed\nup with them and has now developed outside interests. It\nseems, however,to be the fashion at present to present surveys in this paper and we continue on these lines. We give\nour faithful reader our Classification of I.C. lecturers.\nI.C. Lecturers can, we find, be\nlisted as follows:\nGroup I: Incomprehensible. All our lecturers fall into this general\ncategory to some extent. Those fal ling solely into this Group may be\nsubdivided into:\na) Inaudible' - usually these will\nnot, or are unable to write their\nmessage on the blackboard,\no) Those who are unable to write\ndearly.\n3ro up II: Raconteurs: These are\nfound usually in R.S. M. Their lectures a^ e interspersed frequently\nwith \"When I was out in Peru.....\"\nor \" One.big firm I'm doing a bit\nof consulting work for at the mom ent \".\nGroup IH: The mechanical lecturer. One such gentleman in\nthe Electrical Department. 3p rings to mind. This type repeat,\nword for ward, without any notes, the same lecture at the\nsame time year after year.\nj fl ro up IV: Authar*\u00bblecturer.. Usually actually a professor, this\nspecies lecture from \"my book\" (Only 3 gas. from Lamleys, or\n7 gas. from the Bookstall). Students may pass the course by\nb orr cr ving the work from a wealthy and o on3o ien tio us brown-b agger and staying in bed to read it in lieu of dragging themselves to college at an early hour in the morning.\nGtbhp V\": Those who Avoid being Humorous and are Funny. One\nMaths lecturer on oe sadd;\"I want no-one to speak unless he\nhas something to say.* Those suffering from poor circulation\nin the feet make use of this type.\nfl ro up VI: Those who try to be amorous and Fail Dismally: A large.proportion of the students also Fail Dismally. This\ntype of lecturer is usually still living in the days of silent\nfilms. The\"joke\" is useful when the point in the o our se has\nbeen reached where the students know more than he does.\ni\".?5^1i a ao ted tac multitudinous Union\nActivities. (Eef.
