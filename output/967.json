    "content": "Feature\n21 May 1993 Felix 967\nBetween a rock and a hard place\nAs London's quirky est cinema totters from one disaster to another, Jonty\nBeavan asks, how did the Scala get into so much trouble?\nThe Scala cinema club in King's Cross looks like it has fallen off the\nset of a strangely inverted horror\nmovie: It stands tall, white and Art\nDecor, like the home of an\nunusually benevolent Boris Karloff,\nin the wasteland of rotting buildings\nthat surround North East London's main railway stations.\nI approached the building, pushed\nopen the flimsy glass doors and\nannounced myself to the suspicious\nwraith behind the desk. Pausing for\na moment he picked up a phone and\ndescribed me to my waiting\ninterviewee as: 'Another one to see\nHelen'. He then directed me to the\ntop of the building: 'Keep going up\nand it's on the left'.\nQuite how far up I didn't realise,\nstopping in the foyer of the actual\ncinema to regain my sense of\ndirection, I notice a change. My kindly, but unseen vamp i ric host\nhad been overcome with a bout of\npsychedelia. The foyer wall swirled\nwith primary colours, symbols of\nthe illuminati and whirlpools of\nlight. Pausing only for a moment\nlonger to adjust back to reality, I climbed further up the dingy marble\nstairwell.\nEventually the stairs ran out and\na cat guarded the only doorway.\nSlightly relieved that the animal was\nnot in any way black, I crouched\ndown and tried to make friends with\nit. This was the source of some\nconfusion to the people sitting\nwithin the room. They had expected\nthat they were to be interviewed,\nnot their pets.\nAfter making a rather hurried and\nconfused explanation, I was\nintroduced to Helen De Witte and\nAlex Fenner, the Programmer and\nGeneral Manager of the Scala Club.\nHelen was plump, had short, tinted\nhair and did all the talking. Alex\nstayed quiet, answered the phones\nand only showed an interest when\nwe discussed the history and\nstructure of the cinema. Much to\nmy disappointment their office had\na relaxed, cluttered appeal, with\ncats wandering in and out at\nrandom. Nothing could be further\nfrom the imagined shadowy\nchambers of a sinister monster. I felt cheated.\nSince 1981 the Scala's home has\nbeen King's Cross. This most\npeculiar of film clubs moved here\nafter the lease on its Tottenham\nStreet cinema, which it had\noccupied since the early fifties, ran\nout. The Landlord of that place felt\nthat he would get a better deal\nrenting to an up and coming TV station called Channel 4. The Scala\nbuilding had always been a cinema\nsince the 1920's. Now the Circle is\nthe Scala club with the Stalls\nconverted into a snooker hall.\nFirst Helen explained the\nprinciple behind the Club. Her\ndescription of the aims of the Scala\nwere, to show 'art or marginal'\nfilms, but did not fully explaining\nwhat that meant. Distinct from\nmany of London's other repertory\ncinemas, she classified the audience\nas 'fans'. People would come from\nall over London to see a film at the\nScala, she stated. It is not like the\nElectric (another cinema in Notting\nHill) where the audience is local,\nthe people here are working class\nand we don't really concern them.\nThe Scala has a reputation for a showing the gay and lesbian films.\nSandra Bernhardt and Derek\nJarman have made personal\nappearances and Jean Genet films\nare a regular feature. Other\nfavourites for the Scala bill are;\nHong Kong movies, Exploitation,\nArt films and, of course, horror.\nWe get lots of gore hounds here,\ncommented Helen; I shuffled\nuncomfortably, being rather fond of\nthe odd bloodthirsty stretch of\ncel ul oid. Other delights that the Scala\nrevels in are the 'all-night ers'. For\nabout \u00a35, an enthusiastic movie goer can watch a selection of up to five\nfilms through the night. Along with\nthis, seasons of the less well known\ndirectors are shown. This also\nmakes the Scala distinct, it is\nunafraid to play the films other\ncinemas would shrink from. In a world dominated by big budget\nHollywood films, the Scala displays\nan alternative lifestyle that is\nrefreshing, if only because it is\ndifferent.\nBeing radical and risque has\nalmost been the downfall of the film\nhouse. April 1st1992 the Scala\ncinema played an un advertised showing of Stanley Kubrick's 'The\nClockwork Orange' about seventy\npeople attended. Twenty five years\nago, Kubrick banned his creation\nbecause fans of the film copied the\nthug gls h behaviour of the main\ncharacter. The then programme\nmanager of the Scala, Jane Gyles\nwas aware of the ban, but did not\nknow that the full power of the law\nwould enforce it. After the\nshowing, a prosecution was brought\nagainst the Scala by the Federation\nof Copyright Theft. Warner\nBrothers, the owners of the\ncopyright for the Clockwork\nOrange, added to the sense of\ngoodwill by blocking the Scala from\nusing any of the other films under\ntheir licence.\nThe court case was resolved this\nMarch: Jane Gyles was given a one\nyear suspended sentence, the\ncinema was fined \u00a31000 for\ninfringement of copyright, but the\ncosts of the case were \u00a310,000. All\nthese fines have to be meet by the\ncinema. Needless to say Jane Gyles\nis no longer employed as\nProgrammer for the Scala.\nIf that were not enough, the\nPage 10\n\n"

Mr Leary, a final\nyear Biology student, is proposed\nby Grahame Hey and almost\ncompletely seconded. In the\nprevious set of Sabbatical elections,\nduring March, Mr Leary stood for\nthe post of Honourary Secretary\n(Events), but withdrew for reasons\nthat were never made clear. Due to\nan inconclusive result, another\nelection has to held for the post.\nBefore rerunning the contest, Mr Dominic Wilkinson, current Hon\nSec (Events) has changed his\nposition's job description. As part\nof the general restructuring of\nImperial College Union, the Hon\nSec (Events) post is to become\nsolely responsible for student Clubs\nand Societies.\nIf no further candidates announce\nthemselves by 5 pm this evening,\nMr Leary will only be opposed by\nNew Election. Hustings for the post\nwill be held on Thursday 3rd June\nin the Union, with voting taking\nplace on Monday 7th and Tuesday\n8th June.\nOxford women win\nby Andrew Tseng and Declan Curry\nOxford University was found to be\nguilty of sex discrimination and\nhypocrisy over its equal\nopportunities policy this week.\nDons voted 182 to 37 in favour\nof rejecting the appointment of 15\nprofessorships at Congregation, the\nUniversity's parliament. The\n\u00a3100,000 pounds will go instead\ntowards lower level promotions, as\ncurrently 20 per cent of lecturers at\nthe University are women. This\ncompares to 4 women professors,\nless than 5.1 per cent, of the\nUniversity's senior academic\ncommunity.\nThe University's commitment to\nits equal opportunities policy has\nbeen questioned after revelations\nthat it had turned down the advice\nof its equal opportunities\ncommittee. The committee had\nurged the university to create\nreaderships.\nThe high profile proposals at\nOxford have fuelled the national\nequal opportunities debate. The\nAssociation of University Teachers\nhas pointed out that women\nprofessors are paid on average\n\u00a31500 less than their male\ncounterparts. A much higher\nproportion of women than men\nprofessors are in the under \u00a334000\nper annum pay bracket. Less than\n20 per cent of men professors fall\ninto this category.\nThe decision can still be upturned\nif the university's senior executive\nbody, Council, decides that the\nproposals should go to a postal\nballot. In the event of this\nhappening, equal opportunities\ncampaigners are confident that the\n66 per cent majority of this week's vote is an indication of the ultimate\noutcome of any university wide\nballot.\nIn an interview with i CNN Imperial College Radio, Emma\nWestcot, the Women's Officer at\nOxford University said that, 'This\ndecision will encourage women\nlooking for a career in academia.'\nBarber plans for ICU\nby our man in the toilet\nPlans are afoot within ICU to move\nthe games machines from the\nGames room, currently next door\nto Da Vinci's in the Union Building,\nand use the room for another, as yet\nunspecified, purpose.\nThe reason for the movement of\ngames machines is to enable a restructuring of the toilets situated\nbehind the Games Room, to allow\nfor their use by disabled people.\nThis refurbishment will involve an\nexpansion into part of the games\nroom.\nSuggestions have been mooted\nthat while the lavatory update is in\nprogress, the Games room will also\nundergo a complete facelift.\nCurrent proposals imply that a Barbers or Hairdresser salon could\nbe installed in the remaining space.\nWhere the games machines would\nbe moved to, if this proposal went\nthrough, has yet to be considered.\nThe New Imperial College Union Cinema opened last Thursday, with\nunprecedented success writes Jonty Beavan.\nAn audience of over seventy people, watched the film 'Singles' in the\nUnion Concert Hall. This was the first showing of any film by Imperial\nCollege Unions Film Society in its new location. Until before Easter the\nSociety's showings were located in Mech Eng 220. Mr Laugharne, one\nof the projectionists, said he was 'amazed, we never expected so many\npeople'. Yesterday's showing of 'Scent of a Woman' was expected to be\njust as well attended.\nImprovements will continue to the ICU Cinema over summer: Two 35\nmillimetre projectors are to be bought and a projection gallery installed\nat the rear of the Concert Hall. It is hoped that all the changes will be\ncompleted for the beginning of the next academic year.\nSTOIC getting bigger\nby Jonty n' Donny\nSTOIC, Imperial College's very\nown television station, is planning\nto expand from its base on the third\nfloor of the Union Building.\nSTOIC (Student Television of\nImperial College) plots to overflow\ninto the Clubs Committee room.\nThis extra space sits next to the\npresent STOIC studio on the highest\nfloor of the Union Building.\nThe plans have yet to confirmed,\nbut will meet their final testing at\nthe next meeting of House\ncommittee. House committee is a student body responsible for\nfixtures and furnishing of the\nImperial College Union building.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nBoof^ Fatherland\nby Robert Harris\nRobert Harris has a distinguished\npedigree. His factual books were\nfirst class - the outrage of Bernard\nIngham, Yorkshire rasputin\nextra ordinaire, being testament to\nthat. A sympathetic, understanding\nbook on the Welsh chat- show host\nand media star, Neil Kinnock, did\nnot bar Harris from become a scribbler on Britain's biggest\ntabloid, the Sunday Times. Robert\nHarris is a good egg, slightly\nhard-boiled.\nThe birth and delivery of his first\nnovel was well anticipated. (Mr\nIngham would dispute that\nFatherland was the first work of\nfiction, but no matter). Indeed it\nwas well-hyped. Harris appeared on\nthe pseudo-intellectual Richard\nLitdejohn programme. I am pleased\nto report that the book lived up to\nthe hype. It's a gripping read.\nIt may have helped if chapter one\nhad developed at a slighter faster\nrate. The first two paragraphs are\nsupposed to describe a lake, but the\nlakeside location doesn't really\nseem to sink in until paragraph six\nor later. The writing on page one\ncould have been tighter, more\ndescriptive. (Yes, I did read beyond\npage 1, OK?)\nHarris mocks gently. The\nsuspension of reality needed for this\nbook is considerable. Set in 1964,\nit demands the acceptance of\nnothing less than a German victory\nin the Second World War, a victory\nattained after suing for peace with\nBritain in 1944. Alan 'who the\nfuck's Michael?' Clark will note\nthat the peace was not with\nChurchill, who had fled to Canada\n\"along with the rest of his\nwarmongers.\"\nSometimes, Harris tweaks the\nsuspension and grasp of history. By\nthe simple device of the newspaper\n(the eternal historian, Mr Davidson), he predicts his answer\nto the eternal 'What if...' question.\nDateline 1964: \"In London, it had\nbeen announced that King Edward\nwas to pay a state visit to the\nReich.\" King Edward! Had\nElizabeth's father not died yet? No,\nhold on, he was George. Edward\nwas his brother.... the one who\nabdicated in 1936, and then paid a state visit to Nazi Germany in 1937,\nintroduced by Gobbels as the real\nKing of England. Who's that one in\nthe skirt? Ah yes, Queen Wallis.\nElizabeth is also in Canada. One\npresumes that a certain Prince,\nFelix 967\nalleged father of suspected\nInnishowen illegitimate s, was also\nthere.\nIn the imaginary 1964, America\nwas at peace, with Germany at\nleast, since 1946. No race riots, and\nPresident Kennedy still alive. The\n75 year old President Joseph P Kennedy, that is, about to make a state visit to the Reich, in the\ninterests of detente. Strangely,\nHarris retains the historic fact of the\nCold War, not this time between\npartners and World War Two\nvictors USA and USSR, but instead\nan uneasy truce between the USA\nand Germany.\nNow for the plot synopsis. The\nstory hangs on the holocaust,\ngeneral German ignorance of it, and\nthe systematic death of the 14 that\ndid know, those that attended the\nWannsee conference. This leaves\nHitler as the sole surviving keeper\nof the knowledge. And, of course,\nthe state visit of Kennedy.\nIncidentally, Joseph P Kennedy,\n\"appeaser, anti-Semite, gangster\nand son of a bitch,\" was US\nAmbassador to the Court of St\nJames (ie Britain) in 1938. In this\nrole, Kennedy told the German\nambassador to London that the\nJewish question was of great\nimportance to the AmericanGerman relationship. German\ndiplomatic cables from 13 June\n1938 record that 'in this connection,\nthe (American) Ambassador stated\nit was not so much the fact that we\n(Germany) wanted to get rid of the\nJews that was harmful, but rather\nthe loud clam our which\naccompanied this.' Kennedy later\nadded that a large section of the\nAmerican population had an\n'understanding' of the German\n'attitude' towards the Jews. Always\nwilling to cherish all people equally,\nwas Kennedy.\nThe German defeat allowed for\nthe discovery of the Nazi horror.\nDid the Germans know? Some\nguards at the concentration camps,\nthe KZs hinted: \"The water in the\nshower rooms must be very hot\ntoday, since they shout so loudly.\"\nWhat about those remaining in the\nFatherland? \" Of course you knew!\nYou knew every time someone\nmade a joke about going East. We\nknew when we moved into their\nhouses, when we took over their\nproperty, their jobs\".\nKZ s. \"Kulmhof. Belzec.\nTreblinka. Majdanek. Sobibor.\nAuschwitz. Birkena.

Bruscon, played\nby Bates passes time by\nphilo soph ising at length about his\nfamily, the play, the world and life\nin general without reaching any\nparticular conclusion. As writer,\ndirector and performer of the\ncomedy, Bruscon is naturally\nconvinced that it is a masterpiece,\ncomparing it to Shakespeare and\nVoltaire. It contains world leaders\nfrom history: Caesar, Matternich\n(19th century German chancellor),\neighteen year old black teenager is\nstabbed to death by a gang of white\nyouths, in an area where the British\nNational Party has recently set up\nan office.\n\" 'Your interest or lack of it is\nbeside the point.' said the Kripo\nofficer.\"\nBodhran\n\u2022 Published by Arrow, price\n\u00a34.99.\nHitler, Churchill and, as for\nwomen, Churchill's wife and Marie\nCurie.\nAlthough six actors appear in the\nplay, five of them get five per cent\nof the lines.

This\ntime the entrance to a New Year's Eve party in the Scala was locked\nand manned. According to fire\ninspectors, who dropped in for a surprise visit during the party, this\nconstitutes blocking a fire exit. To\nthe Scala it stops them putting on\ntheir most profitable 'multimedia\nevents', fashion shows and parties.\nThe chances of raising the money\nto repay the 'The Clockwork\nOrange' action now come solely\nfrom the 'Save the Scala fund', set\nup when legal case was first\npending.\nHelen argues that the door had to\nbe locked, due to the residual\nproblems of the Kings Cross area.\nWe've always had prostitutes, but\nthe drug dealers have become a real\nproblem, she continued. Drug\ndealing at the entrance to the cinema\nis a regular event. Staff try and get\nthose involved to move on without\nresorting to the police, but there is\nlittle success. Occasionally violence\nspills over from the street: In one\ncase the victim of a chase ran up\ninto the foyer of the cinema only to\nbe caught there, when a Scala\npatron tried to step in and help,\ninjuries occurred. If this were not\nenough the Landlord who owns the\nlease on the building is putting the\nrent up threefold. Things are\nbeginning to look miserable for the\nScala.\nWhy has the local council been\nso stringent on the Cinema? Helen\nhas strong opinions on this question:\nShe believes the plans to put the\nChannel tunnel rail-link at Kings\nCross means an end to the whole\narea. The plans show the rail-link\ngoing straight across the site where\nthe Scala now stands. They are\ngoing to do the same thing as in\nDocklands, run it down, so when\nthe developers buy it up it will be\na blessing, she commented.\nBut all the same, fund raising\ncontinues. It is posible to buy\noranges in the Scala foyer for \u00a31,\nmost of the profits go to the Save\nthe Scala fund, 'Droog in the Dock'\nT shirts are available and the Scala\nOrange Ball takes place next\nThursday 27th May. The Orange\nBall will include a fashion show,\nCelebrity com per e and what is\ndescribed as a 'non-stop party'. Due\nto the previously mentioned ban,\nthe event will be held in Cafe de\nParis, Coventry St, W l. Tickets\nhave to be bought in advance and\ncost \u00a315.

    "content": "Music\nAlbums\nDo you read us?\nDo you like us?\nIf not, why not come in\nand fucking do better.\nAlternatively, go out and\nbuy Smash Hits, or Q. Wild West-Soundtrack\nOne of the most dubious, money-spinning wifes of the Music\nIndustry is the Film Soundtrack.\nThe theory goes, get one glossy\nsingle released and then fdl the rest\nof the time up with lacklustre\ninstrumentals, which may or may\nnot have been in the actual film.\nThe only other option is to have a film about music so the obligatory\nconcert, jukebox or radio scene can\noffer an opportunity to play the\nsoundtrack in the actual context of\nthe plot. Think back to the\n'Bohemian Rhapsody' in Wayne's World. A scary business.\nWell, 'Wild West' is thankfully\nof the latter category. The\njuxtaposition of an Asian Country\nand Western band's search for fame\nand fortune is the vehicle used to\ninclude a standard collection of\nsongs from the so-called New\nCountry wave of the mid-80's. Seminal names such as Steve Earle,\nNanci Griffith and Dwight Yoakam\nprovide the main firepower.\nThe album itself is an interesting\nmix of cover and original versions,\nbut really this only highlights the\ndifferences between the have and\nhave-nots. In comparing Steve\nEarle to Naveen Andrews who\ncovers two songs, it becomes\nalmost embarrassing. The point of\nCountry music is the feeling that the\nsinger has raked around in the dirt\nthemselves, look at the greats like\nPatsy Cline and Hank Williams.\nEven if we did know that Steve\nEarle has four Harley-sized\nmotorbikes, a Hollywood house etc,\nhe can still sing as if he were a wasted farm labourer looking\nthrough whisky pickled pupils. It's not that Andrew's can't sing, he\ndoesn't seem to summon up the\nnecessary character. The only\nworking cover is Griffith's 'Anyone\ncan be Somebody's Fool' sung by\nRebecca Price. A song so whist ful and pretty, it defies anyone more\nsensitive than the Sex Pistols to\nmake a decent stab of it.\nThe soundtrack syndrome rears\nhigh towards the end though, as a couple of Asian tracks, one of\nwhich is delightfully called the\n'Supermarket Theme' are tacked\non. I guess in the film's context it\nall fits in but the whole album really\nsounds like the product of a quick\nsortie around a musical Sainsbury's; a tin of this, a pound of that, put it\nMarc Almond: 12 Years of\nTears\nYeah, alright, this has been out for\nsome time, hasn't it?

I suppose this means\nyou'll never trust us again, doesn't it? Not that you ever did...\n'12 Years of Tears' is a live\nrecording taken from the divine\nMarc's performance at the Royal\nAlbert Hall late last year, and\nthough I have a carefully-nursed\nFelix 967\nloathing for 'live' albums, I'm rather taken with this. The\nparisi enne threads of decaying\nglamour that have permeated his\nevery recording, from 'Torch' and\n'Tainted Love', through 'Waifs and\nStrays', 'Mother Fist' and 'Stories\nof Johnny', up to and beyond\n'Jacques' and 'Jacky', find their\nhome in the orchestrations and the\narchitecture of the Victorian blob up\nthe road. This is Gloria Swanson\ndoing 'Sunset Boulevard' in cabaret\nwith her face caked in make-up, her\nhead full of crystal meth, and her\nlace costume patterned with sherry\nstains.

    "content": "Faith in Doubt\nAttempting to answer his own questions,Geoff Maxwell justifies faith\nin religion.\nAs a Christian I was recently asked\nby a friend how I could justify the\nharm that is done inthe name of\nreligion. Whatever one believes, is\nit possible to ignore the weight of\nevidence that connects religious\nbelief with cultural violence? Most\nreligions share ethical principles\nthat would seem to preclude\nviolence as a solution to any\nproblem, yet historical evidence to\nthe contrary is abundant.\nBefore answering the question, I think it is necessary to define the\nbasis of religion. What such\ndefinition could hope to be\nacceptable to all faiths and even all\nmen? Such a complex question\ndemands a simple answer. I proposed to this friend that there is\nan intrinsic human quality that is the\nroot of any belief.\nI asked this friend, an agnostic,\nwhy one should follow the moral\ncodes of society. Do we resist\nstealing because, however great the\ngain and however small the\npunishment society threatens, we\nbelieve it is wrong. Do we believe\nin a human conscience, or are we\nrestrained only by the fear of\nretribution. In summary is there\ngoodness in every man and are\nhumans able to distinguish right\nfrom wrong.\nIf one believes that there is good\nin every man, what can one call the\ncombination of those consciences?\nHere we must diverge, different\nreligions accumulating legend,\nhistory and circumstance to give\ntheir particular creed.\nThe difficulty we now face is how\nto square such ideals with the reality\nof destruction in the name of belief.\nHow does the apparent beauty of\nthe human conscience become the\nbloody sword of fanatics?\nDiscussing such ideas I have found\nthat many atheists and agnostics can\nbelieve in human conscience, yet\nmost believers, of whatever creed,\ncannot accept conscience as the\nfundamental basis of religion.\nI find it challenging to take one\nfurther step. What is god, or are\ngods, if they are not that part of\ngood in every man? This too is,\nsurprisingly, better suited to the\nagnostic than the believer.\nLike all institutions the\naccumulation of believers into a congregation brings with it the\namplification of human failure. It is\na small step to exchange these\nsimple ideals of religion for\nabsolute confidence in the rules of\none particular creed. When such a step is made, when one can no\nlonger lend respect to the view of\nanother man, then one finds oneself\nplaced as his enemy.\nThe one certainty of belief is that\none cannot know of the existence of\na god but can only believe in it. The\nmain stream religions stand together\nin their recognition of gods as\nbeyond man's knowledge. We can\nbelieve what we may, but when we\nbelieve that we know eve tyl h ing we\npresume to place ourselves amongst\nthe gods.\nThe wrong that has been done in\nthe past, and continues to be done\ntoday, in the name of religion, runs\ncounter to our consciences. This\ndanger must be held up before all\nthose who participate in religion as\na warning of what might occur. The\nleaders of religion have, I believe,\nan obligation to ensure that their\nfollowers understand that our\nconception of God may be\nmisconceived and that the beliefs,\nor lack of such, held by other men\nshould not ever be held against\nthem.\nIt need not be said that some\ndenominations and sections of\ncertain religions have pursued the\nopposing path - seeking to establish-that their particular interpretation oi\ntheir own belief is absolute and\npursuing relentlessly all those who\nopposed them. It seems to me that\nit is herein that the evil of religion\nlies and it is an evil that is certainly\nnot necessary.\nI find it a pity that even here at\nImperial, a centre of excellence in\nlearning and scholarship, that so\nfew people can distinguish between\nthat which we know and that which\nwe believe. I can respect any man\nwho says that, given their\nperception of the evidence for the\nexistence of any particular god, they\ncannot find it in their hearts to\nbelieve in such a god. I am however\nhappy to label any man who says\nthey know that no such god exists,\nor that they have absolute\nknowledge of their own god, a dangerous fool.\nIf we are able to retain this\nperspective on our beliefs there is\nno cause for religion to be a source\nof pain in the world. That is not to\nsay that disasters will not happen,\nthat men will not kill each other,\nthat brother will not hate brother,\nbut only that religion will become\nwhat it has always claimed to be.\nThomas Story, an eighteenth\ncentury Quaker, said of the\nChristian faith, 'The unity of\nChristians never did nor ever will\nor can stand in uniformity of\nthought or opinion, but in Christian\nlove only.' Communication\namongst all men, particularly those\nwith sincere beliefs is important but\nshould rest on that mutual respect\nand tolerance that embodies the\nregard we should all hold for each\nother.\nMy final appeal is to each man -consider carefully what you are\ndoing when you scorn, verbally or\nphysically, the beliefs of another.\nAre you in any position to judge?\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Union\n21 May 1993 Felix 967\nTime for change\nThe Union faces another upheaval with the publication of the report into\nthe Union Structure. StevenNewhouse reports on why55 into 13 doesn't go.\nICU BY-LAWS\nThe Imperial College Union bylaws state, the purpose of ICU is\na) the promotion of student\nintercourse between present and\npast students and academic staff\nof the College.\nb) the encouragement of interest\nby the students in matters outside\nthe College curriculum, especially\ncultural and athletic interests.\nc) the provision of a corporate\nbody of students to represent,\nsafeguard and advance the\ninterests and welfare of the\nstudents of the College.\nOver the last two weeks, Felix has\nbeen covering the results of the\nworking party into the Union\nStructure. The main result seems to\nbe the removal of the present 55\nperson Council and the Executive\ncommittee, and its replacement with\na new 13 person Executive.\nAt the moment, Council consists\nof all the Sabbaticals, the\nDepartmental Representatives,\nConstituent College Union (CCU)\nPresidents and the Majojr and Minor\nSub Committee chairmen. The new\nExecutive would consist of the three\nUnion Office Sabbaticals and\nofficers from the representation\nareas. However, this smaller body\nwould have the same mandate as the\ncurrent Council and Executive, to\nmanage the affairs of the Union.\nTwo years ago there was a major\nchange in how the Union represents\nthe students. The Union General\nMeeting (UGM) that had been held\non a monthly basis was changed to\na termly basis. This forced Council\ninto becoming a policy making\nbody which it was not designed to\nbe.\nThe proposed changes will force\nthe new Executive into making\npolicies, since UGMs will still be\nheld termly, but it will be even less\nrepresentative than Council is at the\nmoment.\nSo having thrown cold water on\nthe report from the working party,\ndo I have any suggestions?\nOne of the working party's conclusions was that Council is too\nlarge to be an effective decision\nmaking body. It is too large to make\neffective decisions, but not\nrepresentative enough for the policy\ndecisions that it makes at the\nmoment.\nIn the box there are the aims of\nImperial College Union, and it\nshould be our primary goal to\nsatisfy these aims and our\norganisation should reflect it. These\naims can be interpreted into three\nareas of the Union's work: social\nevents, clubs and societies, and\nrepresentation within College.\nThe representation of the students\nwithin the College organisation is\ncarried out by Departmental\nRepresentatives, Academic Affairs\nOfficers, Housing and Welfare\nofficers.\nThe management of the clubs and\nsocieties is a task that is at present\ncarried out by the Major Sub\nCommittee chairman. The Minor\nSub Committee chairman directly\norganises events that are open to all\nstudents.\nI would propose that the present\nCouncil is reduced in size and be\nconcerned only with the effective\nrunning of the Union. Its policy\nmaking powers would be limited to\nthis area, but it could formulate and\nrecommended policy to aUG M. The other officers who represent the\nstudents' views on College\ncommittees would report direct iy to\naUG M. Any Union policy that was\nneeded in these areas could then be\ndiscussed and voted upon by the\nstudent body.\nAs a result of these changes the\nCareers info\nVacancies\u2014don't worry if you\nwere too late to apply for the Milk\nRound, we are writing to 1500\nemployers asking for details of their\nremaining vacancies and you should\napply in May or June at the latest.\nAsk to see the Vacancy File in the\nCareers Office.\nCareers Talk for Penultimate\nYears\u2014there is one Careers Talk\nthis week in CR317B Sherfield at\n1.00pm to 1.50pm. No booking is\nnecessary, just turn up.\nTuesday 25th May. 'Teaching as\na Career' by Ms Esther Williams of\nTASC.\nPenultimate Years\u2014start min king about your future now. If you don't know what you want to do, come\ndecisions about the internal working\nof the Union would be made faster\nas many subs i du ary committees\nwould no longer be needed. The\nUnion General Meeting, which\nwould be held at least once a month\nduring term time, would become\nthe policy making body of Imperial\nCollege Union placing the students\nfirmly in control of their union.\nUnder my proposals, Imperial\nstudents would make the decisions\nabout students at Imperial.\nDecisions would be made at the\nU GM, open to all students, and not\nbehind locked doors.\nto the Careers Office and try\nPROSPECT\u2014our computer careers\nguidance system.\nCareers Seminars are being held\neach Wednesday afternoon from\n2.00-4.00pm.

    "content": "'eat ure21 May 1993 Felix 967\nThe Oppression of Tibet\nDuring his much publicised visit to the UK, the Dalai Lama made a plea for an end to the torture and mass murder in Tibet. Sonia Shah\nreports on a refreshingly open and honest man.\nLast week I was honoured to meet\na most extraordinary man - Tenzin\nGyatso, His Holiness the fourteenth\nDalai Lama of Tibet, Tibet's political and spiritual leader. The\nDalai Lama's unique nobility is\nconferred on him by virtue of his\nbeing a manifestation of the\nBoddhisattva of Compassion, who\nchose rebirth to serve humanity; the\npresent Dalai Lama regards himself\nas a 'simple Buddhist Monk'.\nThis enlightened man was\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize in\n1989 for his non-violent struggle for\nthe liberation of Tibet - a tremendous feat in light of the great\nChinese aggression.\nIn his trip to Britain, he has not\nonly met with the Foreign Secretary\nDouglas Hurd, the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, and National and\nEuropean Members of Parliament,\nbut has also given a series of\nlectures on how to live 1'fe with\nwisdom and compassion; this man\nis truly an inspiration to everyone\nwho hears him, or reads his\nwritings.\nSince 1950, 1.2\nmillion Tibetans,\n1/5 of the\npopulation, have\ndied as a result\nof the Chinese\noccupation.\nThe Dalai Lama was born on 6\nJuly 1935, in the small village of\nTaktser in North-Eastern Tibet. At\nthe age of two, this son of a peasant\nfamily was hailed as the\nreincarnation of each of the\nprevious thirteen Dalai Lamas of\nTibet. He began his monastic\neducation at the age of six, during\nwhich time in 1950 he was forced\nto assume complete political power\nwhen China invaded Tibet. Tibet\nfound itself in a helpless situation,\noverpowered by the military force\nof China. The invasion of Tibet was\nan act of aggression and violation\nof international law and human\nrights, yet pleas for help to several\nleading nations of the world, and to\npolitical prisoners are held in\nprisons and labour camps. Tibetan\nwomen are subjected to mandatory\nsterilisation and forced abortion.\nPrisoners are subjected to various\nChinese to move to Tibet by\noffering incentives.\nThe Chinese have caused\ndestruction of Tibet's natural\nresources and widespread\nthe United Nations, were rejected.\nIn 1954, on an official visit to\nChina, meetings with Mao Tse-tung\nand political authorities uncovered\nthe contradictions of political life in\nChina. Communism in China is\nstrongly anti-religious, while\nTibet's whole culture and way of\nlife is centred on Buddhism. The\nChinese Government has never\nattempted to understand the Tibetan\npeople, or their culture.\nIn 1959, during the national\nuprising of the Tibetan people\nagainst Chinese occupation, the\nDalai Lama was forced into exile.\nSince then he has been living in\nDharamsala, India, seat of the\nTibetan Government-in-exile.\nTibetan people everywhere in the\nworld, believe their Governmentin-exile to be the sole legitimate\nGovernment of Tibet.\nSince 1950, 1.2 million Tibetans,\n1/5 of the population, have died as\na result of the Chinese occupation.\nThousands of religious and\nforms of torture including being\nsuspended from their prison ceiling,\nelectrocution, beatings with cattle\nprods, and interrogation at gun\n'Action did not\nseem profitable',\nsaid a British\nOfficial.\npoint - for expressing their beliefs.\nToday, over 120,000 Tibetans\nare living in exile.\nChina forbids the teaching of\nBuddhism - a facade of religious\nfreedom has been initiated for the\npurposes of propaganda and\ntourism. Chinese 'population\ntransfer' is being encouraged,\nmaking Tibetans a minority in their\nown country- 7.5 million Chinese\ncompared with 6 million Tibetans\nin Tibet. The Chinese authorities\nactively encourage large numbers of\nenvironmental devastation.\nI would like to describe my\nmeeting with the Dalai Lama at a press conference in London. On\nentering the room, he did not go\nstraight to his seat, but instead\nwarmly greeted members of the\npress. As he sat down, one\nimmediately felt his sheer\ncaptivating presence and calmness.\nDuring the press conference the\nDalai Lama showed tremendous\ninsight and a friendly sense of\nhumour. The Dalai Lama is not\nsome distant religious figure, but is\na human being who bases his life\non compassion, peace, altruism and\nkindness. He is refreshingly open\nand honest and puts up none of the\nbarriers so common of other\npolitical leaders.\nThe Dalai Lama made it clear for\nthe first time that the option of\nindependence for Tibet has been\nforeclosed and said that he wants to\ndiscuss a 'one country, two\nsystems' approach, similar to that\nPage 12\n\n"

His latest client is Rachel\nMarron, pop superstar-turned-actress, played by Whitney\nHouston, who has successfully\nmoved in real life from pop\nmega star to talented actress.\nRachel's fabulous career just seems\nto spiral upward without end, and\nwith it comes the usual trappings of\nsuccess\u2014a manager, a publicist, a horde of hangers-on and one that's much more sinister. An obsessive\nfan writes her crazy letters and\nbreaks into her bedroom, so it's time for the flamboyant diva to get\nherself some serious protection\u2014\nand Frank Farmer is the best. Both\nFrank and Rachel expect to be in\ncharge...what they don't expect is\nto fall in love...\nLots of action, plenty of drama,\nromantic moments.. .everyone will\nfind something in this film. Much\nof the soundtrack has been through\nthe charts...a couple of number\nones including the record-breaking\nhit J Will Always Love You. If you\nhaven't seen the film but the songs\nhave been driving you wild over the\nlast five months, now is your\nchance to find out what they all\nmean.\nRemember we show in the\ncinematic splendour of the Concert\nHall, two floors above Da Vinci's bar, and believe it or not, our screen\nis bigger than many at local\ncinemas, and we're a lot cheaper at\nonly \u00a31.90 (90p for members). The\nreels will be turning for The\nBodyguard at precisely 7.30pm next\nThursday. The following week we\nhave Under Siege, and following\nthe success of last night's Budweiser competition, we have\nlots of Under Siege sweatshirts,\ncaps, and torches to give away\ncourtesy of our friends at Warner\nBrothers. Don't miss it!\nshells! Pete brought up a few rusted\nlumps of metal, that Steve\nproceeded to chuck back in the\nwater.\nThe afternoon's entertainment\nwas the Falmouth subs. No\nproblem, Um, lots of kelp and a few\nbroken up submarines, but a huge\nswell! The fish had a good feed\nfrom some very green looking\nnovices. When our stomachs had\nstopped heaving, we retired to the\npub for more beer.\nAs the week progressed, we\ndived, drank and drove the marine\nwildlife round the bend. Steve's continued to find any wrecks we\nwanted to by instinct and not\ninstrument. One of the highlights\nfor me was the trip's night dive.\nAfter a few hours sitting in a freezing van in a freezing wet suit,\nthe sun finally set and we could get\nin the water and get it over with.\nWhy you would want to dive at\nnight is not that obvious, after all\nit's cold and dark enough during the\nday! At night, a lot of the marine\nlife comes out to eat, and on this\nnight have 400 watt dive torches\nshined in their faces by divers. We\nfound two dead dogfish, and a swarm of swimming crabs. It was\na really eerie experience swimming\nthrough the darkness, with fish\nsuddenly racing across your torch\nbeam. After about three quarters of\nan hour of this, I started to get cold\nand we headed back for shore. This\nwas a bad move, as it was even\ncolder out of the water!\nOn our last night in Cornwall, we\nhad our trip piss up and a chance\nto sum up the week's diving. The\nmajor shock was the 'cleavage of\nthe trip' award not going to Pete\nafter a tough challenge by Ian. The\n'cutest buddy pair' went to Gary\nand Sheena, for holding hands\nunder water and having matching\ndry suits. Scott, one of this year's new novice divers won the 'most\ndive leader like novice' award for\nchecking up on Petes, (one of our\nmost experienced divers) air, and\nthen refusing to go home when told.\nIan was also unofficially awarded\n'trip back seat driver' for telling\nHolf and Steve how to drive a boat,\nand then cowering in the bottom of\nthe boat when it got a bit rough.\nIn all an excellent week's diving.\nIf you fancy a go, meet us down the\nunion bar on Tuesday evening, or\nsee us next year at the Freshers'\nFair.\nClubs & Societies\n21 May 1993 Felix 967\nWe stayed on a caravan sight on the\ncliffs at St Keverne, (just around the\ncorner from the bay featured in the\nnew BT ad) and dived out of\nFalmouth.\nAt the start of each day we met\nup for dive briefing. Simon, our\nDive Officer (or mum to us) gave\nus the run down for the day. This\nincluded the bad news (normally the\nweather), the good news that we\nwere actually going diving and a reminder of the trip motto, 'be safe\nand sensitive'. Our first taste of\nopen water diving, (and salt water)\nwas round the next bay at\nPorthouslock. Kitting-up was no\nproblem, but getting into the water,\nwell! After staggering around in the\nsurf like drunk penguins, we finally\ngot our heads under water. Wow!\nIt's not at all like the pool\u2014no tiles,\nold ela stop lasts or hair bands. After\nfloundering around in three meters\ngetting sorted out, we set off for a good mooch. This involves\nrummaging around in the kelp and\nmolesting any crustacean or fish\nstupid enough to get caught. Far too\nsoon, the pressure gauges hit 50bar and we had to go back to dry land,\nand the next major obstacle, getting\nout! Some more penguin\nimpressions and a good go at a beached whale from Scott and that\nwas it, our first dive. We dived the\nsame beach in the afternoon and\nthen retired for lots of the second\nactivity of a dive holiday\u2014drinking.\nThe second day gave us a chance\nto use our new boat, a bright orange\nrigid inflatable (see picture). We\nhired Steve, the owner of the local\ndive shop to take us out on his new\nbig blue rib, with CPS, echo\nsounder and any other electronic\ngadget you can buy (to be wired for\nsound as well for next year). After\nflying over the waves for half an\nhour, Steve looked around, stopped\nthe boat and threw over the shot-line. 'Straight down, you should\nland on her boilers' were his\nconfident words, and not one look\nat his gadgets. Down into the murky\ndepth we plunged, and out of the\ngloom loomed a huge lump of metal\nthat made up the Volnay's boiler.\nNow that's what I call navigation!\nThis was it, real diving and no kelp,\nbut I did find an ela stop last.

Fame at last\nDear Editor,\nMany a time I have shied away\nfrom complaining about Felix\nmusic reviews, mainly because they\nleave me questioning whether I know anything about current\nreleases.\nI have two main grievances to air:\nFirstly, I am in possession of a considerable music collection,\nalbeit of mainstream tendency, and\nI bele ive that I am well above\naverage in the IC musically\neducated department. Why then,\nhave I not heard the names, even,\nof most of the groups reviewed in\nFelix? None of my flat mates have\nheard of any of them! Surely it\nwould not be beyond the capabilities\nof the journalists to review an album\nby a group we may have heard of,\nor even material that we might wish\nto purchase.\nIt may show off a deep\nknowledge of music trivia to be able\nto describe 'An Epileptic Jellybean'\nas being the best thing since\n'Wibble', but for the most of us, the\nreview's irrelevance is obviously\ncompounded when we know neither\nband. Picture a person trying to\nexplain what an orange is like, to\nan Eskimo, by saying that it's like\na grapefruit, only smaller.\nSecondly, I am the first to admit\nthat my grammar is suspect, but I am tired of attempting to glean the\nintended meaning from between\nseemingly random punctuation and\nincomplete sentences. If I can get\nthe meaning then mostly it's not\neven about the album under review.\nThe review ultimately fails to tell\nme much about the songs on the\nalbum, surely the main point of the\nreview! I do not want to cramp\nanyone's style but it's downright\nannoying when a music review tells\nus more about the writer's alter ego\n(eg Lise Yates, RIP) than the music.\nThis is not meant to start a war\nof words, but, HIGHBROW,\nPRETENTIOUS MUSIC JOURNALISTS risk your self-esteem and review something that's going to get into the top 20 album\nchart every now and again, 'ey?\nYours sincerely,\nMartin Godet, Civ Eng 2.\nDear Jonty,\nNow that I have achieved\nworldwide fame after appearing on\nthe front cover of Felix juggling\ntorches (Felix 966), I thought I would use my celebrity status to\nmention that we are trying to start\na circus skills society for next year.\nAt the moment we have informal\npractice in the Union Lounge on\nWednesday at about 3.00pm.

'As the wires\ntouched the back plate, sparks flew\nacross the corridor', he said\nyesterday. An eyewitness reports\nhearing an audible cry as the lights\nwent out, while another says that\nMr Comeaux 'reeled back from the\nwall'. The incident was\nimmediately reported to Richard\nOwen, a sub warden, who covered\nthe offending junctions with posters\nand informed the warden, Professor\nGeoffrey New. An immediate\ninvestigation was begun, with\ncollege electricians spending\nMonday and Tuesday covering\nblocks in Falmouth Keogh Hall, but\nnot upstairs in Tizard Hall on\nstaircase one.\nFelix understands that when the\nincident was reported, some\nconsiderable time after its\noccurrence to Messrs Leach and\nGuirey of Estates Management,\nthey were rather shocked, and\nclaimed that they were not\npreviously aware of Mr Comeaux's electrocution. Further controversy\nhas since arisen due to Mr Comeaux's subsequent denial that\nthe incident ever occurred, and\nProfessor New has added to this.\nQuestioned on Tuesday by Imperial\nCollege News Network (i CNN) STOIC, Professor New said he had\nbeen informed of an incident\ninvolving a student's accident with\nexposed electrical currents, but that\nthis allegation had since been\nwithdrawn. Subsequent attempts\nmade by i CNN to gather\ninformation have drawn a blank,\nsuggesting that the 'incident' is\nmerely wild speculation intended to\nfuel an outbreak of mass hysteria in\nSouthside Halls.\nWhen i CNN spoke to Estates\nManagement, they said that a Safety\nCommittee sits every term to\ndiscuss matters like this, and\nproduced a copy of the 'IC\nDangerous Occurrences Report\nForm (not causing injury)' that\nshould be submitted by any student\nexperiencing such an incident. The\nform should be filled in to report\nany dangerous incidents occurring\naround the campus, but evidence\nacquired by i CNN suggests that\nknowledge of the existence of this\ndocument is very scarce. This\n'After the Fact' approach to\npotential hazards within halls of\nresidence has been condemned as\n'foolhardy', as it is implicit that the\nextent of faults must be appraised\nin terms of risks or injuries arising\nfrom those faults, before any action\nis taken to rectify them.\n6 8\nRestructure College\nRage Lifts...\n12/13\nOut with the\nDalai Lama\n16-21\nReviews\nGalore\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 967\n'eat ure21 May 1993\nof Hong Kong and Taiwan with\nChina.\nThis shift in attitude comes from\nthe urgent situation concerning\nhuman rights violations, Chinese\n'population transfer', increasing\nenvironmental damage and most\nimportantly the 'intentional of\nunintentional cultural genocide'. A major concern is to save Tibet's unique culture.\nDeng Xiaoping, China's leader,\nis now willing to discuss anything\nexcept complete independence, so\nwith both sides willing to accept a 'one country, two systems'\napproach, talks look promising.\nHowever, the success depends upon\nChina's final interpretation of this\napproach. On the question of full\nindependence the Dalai Lama says\nthat 'ultimately the Tibetan people\nhave the right to decide'.\nIn the meeting with Douglas\nHurd, the Foreign Secretary told the\nDalai Lama that he would speak out\nhis concern over human rights and\nChinese 'population transfer' into\nTibet. After many years of\nindifference, this would seem to\nindicate the British Government\nadopting a more favourable position\n- in the past Britain has been\nreluctant to upset the Chinese\nbecause of Hong Kong. Douglas\nHurd also voiced his support for\nTibetan talks with China 'without\nTibetan women\nare subjected to\nmandatory\nsterilisation and\nforced abortion.\npre-conditions'.\nThe Tibetan leader said that he\nsupports a boycott of Chinese goods\nunder certain conditions, because\nTenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama in Britain last week.\nalthough 'China are very eager to\njoin the mainstream of the world\ncommunity in the economic field,\nthis is not sufficient; democracy and\nfreedom are even more important\nand therefore the world community\nhave a moral and practical\nresponsibility. It is important that\nChina is brought into the\nmainstream of democracy and in\norder to develop democracy more\nquickly pressure is needed mainly\nin the economic field'.\nThe Dalai Lama visited\nWashington last month, and\nengaged in talks concerning\n'population transfer' and China's 'Most Favoured Nation' status with\nthe US, which is up for renewal in\nJune. Conditions on China are\nlikely to be imposed.\nIt is imperative to remember that\nwe are not only talking of justice,\nhuman rights and equality, but of\na people entitled to their country.\nThe Chinese\nhave caused\ndestruction of\nTibet's natural\nresources.\nTibet has no oil, but it has its own\nculture; language, beliefs and\ncustoms. It is a nation in its own\nright and as such its people have the\nright to their freedom just as we are\nfree to practice our cultures.\nWhen finally, nine years after the\ninvasion, the United Nations passed\na resolution criticising the denial of\nhuman rights in Tibet, Britain\nrefused to give its support because\n'Action on a political side did not\nseem profitable' (British Official at\nthe UN).\nBritain's stand has since changed\na little - this is due to the continuing\neffort of the Dalai Lama, the\nTibetan organisations, those who\nsupport Tibet and those who are\nwilling to make a stand; those who\nwill press u rise their Government\nand those who write to the MPs.\nThis pressure must continue.\nIt would certainly be naive to\nassume that you or I could change\nthe world, but together we could\nmake a difference.\nI would like to end with a few\nwords from the Dalai Lama's Nobel\nPeace Prize acceptance speech,\n'The problems we face today,\nviolent conflicts, destruction of\nnature, poverty, hunger and so on,\nare human-created problems which\ncan be resolved through human\neffect, understanding, and the\ndevelopment of a sense of\nbrotherhood and sisterhood. We\nneed to cultivate a universal\nresponsibility for one another and\nthe planet we share. Although I have found my own Buddhist\nreligion helpful in generating love\nand compassion, even for those we\nconsider our enemies, I am\nconvinced that everyone can\ndevelop a good heart and a sense\nof universal responsibility with or\nwithout religion'. With these words\nin mind I urge you to please give\nyour support.\nIf you would like to support\nTibet, write with an S.A.E., to:-Tibet Foundation,\n10 Bloomsbury Way,\nLondon\nWC1A 2SH If you would like to sponsor a boycott of Chinese goods,\nwrite (with S.A.E.) to:-Boycott China,\nc/o The Fourth World\nMovement,\n20 Heber Road,\nLondon\nNW2 6A A Page 13\n\n"

Yet again, you were\nright; we make a glib statement, put\nit in a particularly vulgar shirt, and\nsend it out with a public school\neducation, a beef paste sandwich\nand fi ick all else to back it up.\nSo what makes them 'one of the\nbest new bands in Britain'?\nNothing. We lied. Sometimes we\ncan't do anything else; whether it's a question of ulterior motives, or\nfibbing for the sake of it, and to\nabuse our position of authority.\nThey aren't nearly aerodynamic\nenough for my liking. Glyph may\nhave thought 'Pablo Honey' was\nbrilliant, but from what I 've heard\nof them, I think a Radiohead record\nis more accurately described with\nthe words retentive, navel-contemplating wank fest. They're\nfucking ugly, too. But that's purely\nmy opinion. I'm just pissed off\n'cause I have to type this bloody\nthing in. If you like them,\ntoothbrush your eyes and sit back,\nfor Glyph MacCord's completely\nnon-indulgent rollercoaster ride,\nentitled 'an evening with\nRadiohead'.

    "content": "Editorial\nAllow me the indulgence of your\nimagination for a few minutes.\nSuppose you are the manager of a large business. Let's take it a little\ncloser to home; imagine you are the\nhead of a College of the University\nof London. s Now, let's expand it a little\nfurther, you have noticed that one\nof the departments under your remit\nis making a severe financial loss. Of\ncourse, this cannot continue, but\nwhat is your first step? Should you\nclose down the Department? Make\nserious cuts in the running cost of\nthe area concerned? Break up the\nDepartment and merge it with\nanother, more profitable, part of the\nCollege?\nWhatever you decide, how would\nyou do it? When you make serious\ncost cutting efforts, people are\ngoing to get hurt, jobs are going to\nbe lost. What about the prospective\nstudents to the department? If they\napply to a course and then find that\nits entire structure has been changed\nin order to save money, they will\nnot be happy. Also there are\nacademic concerns. A department\nlosing money does not mean a department unable to contribute\ngreatly to the sum of knowledge.\nAfter all, teaching is what\nUniversities are meant to be there\nfor. It could be that this department\nteaches and researches topics that\nare not covered anywhere else in the\ncountry. Upheaval in that\ndepartment could affect the\nacademic standing of the whole\nCollege.\nTo continue with our fanciful\nspeculation, there is also another\nCat's Eyes\nRefugees\nAs users of the Underground may\nalready be aware, a new breed of\nbeggar has appeared on the stations,\nor to be more precise, on the trains.\nThey walk from carriage to\ncarriage, with the look of\nhopelessness on their faces and a pathetic appearance complimented\nby the jumble sale clothes they\nwear. As they approach you, your\nin-built prejudices may dismiss\nthem as low- lifes, wastrels,\nunderlings to be ignored. But your\nthoughts are soon taken away once\nyou spot the give away to their\nidentity: a piece of ragged paper\nheld feebly in one hand. What does\nproblem; the situation must be\nsorted out very quickly. Money\ncannot go pouring down the drain,\nbut time must be set aside to\nconvince members of staff of any\nrear rang ment s. It does not do to\nsteamroller any alteration over\nstaff. Imperial College had a vivid\nreminder of that during the\nMessenger, Security and Car\nParking dispute last year.\nFine. Whatever you decide, you\nneed at least to talk to all the people\nconcerned. The head of the\ndepartment, the lecturers, the Old\nstudent associations, all the support\nstaff involved. Oh, I suppose the\nactual students studying there will\nhave to be told, but they hardly\nmatter. A few might complain, but\nthe vast majority just get on with\nthis paper have written on it?\nI'm not too sure to be honest,\nbecause the handwriting can be\nscruffy. But key words include\n'Bosnia', 'refugee', 'poor',\n'homeless' and 'help'. Anyone they\napproach doesn't really read it, and\ncertainly no one gives generously.\nBut can you blame them? Since it\nwas highlighted some time ago, that\nbeggars can earn a small fortune per\nday, the public have become more\nsceptical as to their authenticity.\nNevertheless, roaming the trains\nis at the least a different approach\nand the original beggar deserves\ncredit (wouldn't he prefer cash ! -Ed). But it fails. Despite the\nsituation in the late-Yugoslavia,\nobtaining sympathy, and with it\nsome money, from commuters who\nloathe the unpredictable tube, is\nharder than getting blood from a stone.\nFelix 967\ntheir work and do very little else.\nIt hardly seems worthwhile to\nindulge the egos of a few oversized\nteenagers in affairs like this.\nBesides, in a few years they will be\ngone. It seems like they have no\nconcern anyway. After all how\nmany voices of student outrage\nwere raised when Sir Eric Ash\nannounced a 're-examination' of\nour position within the University\nof London? Who, sabbaticals aside,\ncomplained about the extension of\nthe college day, that ignored a referendum taken three years ago\nby Imperial students who said they\ndid not want it? Is it really two years\nsince the Rector's last Question\nTime?\nNo don't bother with the\nstudents, they aren't worth talking\nRCS This is a piss take. (No spite or\nmalice is intended)\nTo get social colours off your C CU,I was told, you basically had to do\nnothing except hang around the\nC CU exec a lot. Take a look at the\nRCS Union Awards List 1992-93 to\nsee what I mean: Paul Thomas,\nDave Goddard, The B/s ht editors,\nyou get the idea.\nWhy then did they include such\ncontributors as Jonty Beavan?\nStrange.\nMadonna Space Filler\nFill in the missing word, that was\ndeliberately left out from the chorus\nof Erotica, and is replaced by a lot\nof 'ahh-ing':\nGive it up,\nDo as I say,\nGive it up,\nOpinion\n21 May 1993\nto at all.\nCredits\nNews: Andrew Tseng, Declan\nCurry, Monsieur Crotaz.\nFeature: Sonia, Harry, Geoff\nMaxwell, Reviews: Donny, Phil,\nTintin, Laura, Flossie, Marcus\nAlexander, Patrick Wood, Choc,\nPoddy, Gareth, GPH.

The experience can\nproduce a variety of effects:\nIncrease in heart rate, and breathing\nrate, release of ex c it a tory hormones, and one woman (going\nup 55 floors in an office block)\nexperienced, and I quote: 'a numbness in my upper legs and\nsurrounding area for the duration of\nthe ride...'\nThis guide is for all lift-lovers out there, and anyone who\nis simply curious as what the best\nlife in college is. Any unusual lift\nexperiences you have, please notify\nme (Harry Estleun c/o Donny\nO 'Nonchalent, Felix Office, Beit\nQuad, Prince Consort Road, SW7\n2BB). Give details when making\nsubmissions. All Letters will not be\nin the strictest of confidence.\nChemistry/ BioChemistry These shake uncontrollably; was I in a lift or a giant\ncocktail shaker? The panels are crude, the lighting is not\nas bright as it should be and they are relatively small.\nBut they have mirrors on the back wall! Could be better.\nComputing HE Z J B^J^ wo\n\u00b0^mes em^me Panels are shit! Really shit! I hate\nthem! They are big though, have good lighting and are\nquite quick. They have a distinctive quality unmatched\nby any other lift I tested, a quality that may appeal to some\npeople: they smell of rubber. It'sun mistake able. The\nmoment the doors close, it hits you; the waft of rubber.\nThe combination of this and the mild shaking of the lifts,\nprovides what might be for some, the ultimate turn on.\nBiology (East Wing)\nj^/j Don't ask how I got past the security system! This one\nisn't much of an improvement when compared to the\nUnion lift. It's clean (apart from the illegible signature\non one side) and the button panel is relatively idiot proof.\nBut there is hardly enough room to swing a genetically\nengineered dwarfed gerbil in here, and it's so slow. Come\nBiology Dept., you can do better.\nBiology (West Wing)\n1 like me yuPPie flat stv le sliding door but the dirty look\nI got from Postgrad's who suspected that I was an\nUndergrad put me off this lift. Sorry, this one gets a lousy\nrating (blame the Postgrad's). Sherfield\nI^H^1^ Choice of two again. These lifts are spacious, clean, well\nlit and quite quick. But the 'carpet' is really horrible: It\nis! A gross pattern that is hopefully no longer available,\nworn down and slightly darker towards the centre. The\npanel is almost out of date, the display is basic but it has\na guide as to what on's each floor, useful for infrequent\nusers. Better than some by far.\nCivil Eng These pair of lifts are small-ish, badly lit and have no\napparent floor indicator (may be I was looking in the\nwrong place). This was catered for blind people I think:\nthey have poor light (why would blind people need light)\nand BIG buttons. If my memory serves me correctly,\nthey do have mirrors on the back wall though (I'm not\ncertain, be warned). Not my favourite but not the worst.\nGeology/ Materials X~X Crude, quite quick, shite panel and gross colours,\nsaid.\n'nuf\nMechanical Eng Four to choose from! That's right, four. All of these lifts [V] are massive and with good lighting. The panel is a similar\nstyle to that of the Sherfield lifts. But there is a down side.\nThey are slow; slow to take you up and down and also\nslow for the doors to close. The doors are also extremely,\nbut not completely, unresponsive to anything that touches\ntheir edges once they have started to close. I would have\nliked to rate it higher, but alas I can't. Physics both identical. Each has a|^/]|V'|[ VJ[V'| Choice of two in Physics\nmirror on the back face which I thought was quite kinky\nCoupled with the satiny lighting effects this turned out j V||y]|V' j to be an enjoyable ride. But it was all over to quickly!\nWhat have the Physicists done to these lifts? They have\nbloody turbo charge! Travelling 8 floors takes as quickly\nas travelling 2 floors in Biology. This is good for getting\nto lectures quickly (why anyone would want to do this\nis a question that has puzzled me for hours), but bad for\nappreciating the lifts. They also have a high tech level\nindicator and posh panels to boot. Also, like the\nAeronautics/Chem Eng lift, they have no smell. But unlike\nit, the doors close in the blink of an eye; a bit of a danger\nfor slow coaches. This has to be the best.\nElectrical EngA twin set of lifts with mirrors that shake quite violently ^[y^l^/ j when reaching the top floor; electrical engineers are kinky\ndevils, aren't they! These are quick, clean, but not that\nwell lit, mind. They have a clomp y style decor which is\nstomach churning. Nice overhead panel and they were\nvery silent when going down. A good pair.\nUnion Building\nThis sad excuse of a lift is small, dirty, slow, smells ,7^||?^|[^||^\ncharacteristically of un cleaned public toilets and has barely ~\nenough light for you to see the green splodge of graffiti\nthat is spread across two sides, (I think it could be the\nproduct of a hay fever sufferer, but I wasn't prepared to\nexamine it). The only sensation I got was a sudden desire\nto empty my stomach. Avoid at all costs. (But praise the\nlord because Andrew Wensley has promised (in his\nmanifesto) to make the Union a nicer place to work. Let's hope he starts with the lift).\nAeronautics/ Che mEng SISIKIIE]\nThis was bigger than the Biology lifts and a hell of a lot V/ cleaner, but strangely enough, it had no smell. No urine,\nno polish, nothing was detected by my nose. It was\nquicker than the Biology lifts and the buttons were\nstraightforward. Not a bad lift.\nThanks to Cub, the student newspaper/magazine of Queen Mary & Westfield, for the idea of this feature.\nPage 8\n\n"

Oxfam are holding a sponsored\ncycle ride on Saturday June 26th, between Chislehurst (that's near\nBromley), and Aylesford. The\nround trip is 63 miles, but the less\nambitious among us can opt to do\none leg only - either\nLondon/Aylesford (35 miles) or\nt 'other way (28 miles). Transport\nback to London has been arranged\nfor the lazier people. Sounds like a civilized form of torture to me, but\nanyone who feels like a little\nexercise for a good cause can get\nmore details either by contacting\nMike Chamberlain via the Rag\nOffice, or direct by calling Oxfam\non 071 585 0220 (speak to Jim).\nRegistration is only \u00a33 for students,\nso no pleas of poverty, please!\nCharity chaos\nNow the new committee has been\nelected, the Rag Fete has happened\n(in a big way!), and exams are\nlooming even for the biologists, the\nRag Year is beginning to wind\ndown. The usual round of concerts,\ncollections and football matches will\ncontinue, and details of any you\nmight hear of can normally be\nfound on the Rag Noticeboard (half\nway up the stairs on the way to the\nRag Office - for those that don't know where that is, try the East\nstaircase off Beit quad.)\nAlternatively, you can pop into the\nRag Office itself, or come to one of\nthe weekly meetings (1.10pm, Fridays in the Ents Lounge), or\nfailing all of these, leave a message\nin the Rag pigeon hole in the Union\nOffice. So, no excuses for not\nknowing all about forthcoming\nevents!\nAt last week's Rag meeting, a number of charities were voted in\nas next year's 'nominated charities'.\nBut what does being a nominated\ncharity actually mean? It seems as\nif a few people may have been\nunder the impression that Rag only\ncollects for the charities it elects\nevery year. This is not the case at\nall! Rag generally collects under\nany licence it can get it's little paws\non, regardless of the charity. Well,\nthat's not quite true, we can at least\nafford to choose where and when\nwe collect! Nominated charities, on\nthe other hand, are given the\nproceeds from Rag events, such as\nthe Rag Week profits, plus anything\nthat Rag collects under it's own\nname. This means that Rag has the\nopportunity to give money to\nsmaller charities, that can't wangle\nthemselves a licence or are more\ndifficult to collect for (would you\ngive money to a charity you'd never\nheard of?), as well as collecting for\nlarge charities like Mencap and\nOxfam. All the charities elected for\nnext year are big and well- known\n- this may be because these are the\ncharities you lot really want to\nsupport, or may be because we\nRaggies didn't explain the\ndifference between nominated\ncharities, and those we collect on\nthe street for. So, we are rerunning\nthe elections to give you a chance\nto say where you really want your\nmoney to go. The form below lists\n'small' charities on the left, and\n'big' ones on the right; bring it\nalong to the meeting this Friday,\nand have you say.\nFREE\nFLIGHTS\nJohn Grooms Flag Day, on June\n5th, is the perfect opportunity for\nthose of us too poor to afford a holiday this summer. The charity,\nwhich works with and for disabled\npeople, helping them to live life to\nthe full, is offering a voucher for\ntwo free flights to anybody\ncollecting over \u00a3130. Rag has opted\nto collect in tube stations on the day,\nso that any of you wanting to collect\ncan not only do so regardless of the\nweather, but also stand a very good\nchance of raising the required\namount. So what are you waiting\nfor? Start planning your holiday\nnow! Destinations include Florence\nand Paris for a start - I honestly\ncan't remember the rest, but they're\na lot more exotic.
