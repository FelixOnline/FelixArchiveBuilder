You\u2019re\nall playing Modern\nWarfare 2. You\u2019re\nnot reading this.\nYou probably even bought a copy and\nleft it open at the games pages next to\nyou as you play, just to symbolically\nunderline the degree to which you\u2019re\nnot reading this. You bastard. However, while you\u2019re feverishly not reading\nthis on Friday night, I\u2019ll be equally fervently not caring either, because this\nweek I bought Torchlight.\nAnd man, is it good. It aggravates all\nmy RSI problems like no other game, but\nI cannot stop playing it. It\u2019s a beautiful\neffort to create a \u201cDiablo 2.5\u201d\n, a 3D version of the ultimate RPG hacker, with a\nmodern take on it and a good few years\nof reflection on the design. The management side of things, with inventories and\noptimisation, is streamlined beautifully.\nThe world is more alive, thanks to a solid\ngraphics engine and more interaction\nwith the landscape - hordes of spiders piling out of concealed mineshafts or caves,\nthe kind of dyamism you just don\u2019t get in\ntraditional isometric hack and slash af-fairs. And above all else, the drip-feed of\npoints, improvements and areas is tuned\nto perfection. I went on for half an hour\nthe other night. I emerged three hours\nlater.\nBut enough of my complete inability to\ncontrol my own schedule. The point is,\nyou either decided to buy Modern Warfare 2 despite the string of PR cockups, or\nyou didn\u2019t. Chances are you did. Games,\nlike almost every other entertainment\nproduct, tend to avoid boycotts exceptionally well, because for all the interest\nthat is generated about the development\nprocess, the people involved, the impact,\nthe inspiration and so on, what people are\nhere for is an experience. Whether that\nexperience came off the back of a homophobic advertising campaign, whether\nthat experience is being sold on a date\nthat makes it slightly distasteful, whether\nthat experience is provided by the most\nhilariously incompetent and PR-inept\ncommunity team ever, the experience is\nthe experience, and as long as that hasn\u2019t\nchanged it\u2019s still worth looking at.\nIt\u2019s been a bad month for Infinity Ward,\nfrom the first announcement that they\nwere dropping dedicated servers right\nup until the last announcements about\nsmaller matches online and controversy\nover advertising. But it\u2019s all over now, and\nfinally you\u2019re now able to judge what they\nactually produced. Ignoring the business\nside, the media side, you now have the\ngame. And it\u2019s probably best just to stop\nwriting this, and leave you to it.\nBefore I go, though - we\u2019re lining up a\nwhole bunch of exciting stuff for the December issues - if there\u2019s a game you want\nus to cover, a developer you want us to\ntalk to, or something you just think we\nneed to see right now, we\u2019d love to hear\nwhat you want to see, so email us at the\naddress at the top.\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nTen Long Years - 2004\nD\namn, if this year isn\u2019t a\nbig one. Let\u2019s get cracking straight away. HalfLife 2. Talk.\n\u201cNot an incredible\ngame, but a pretty major step forward\nfor FPS\u2019.\u201d\nOh. Anyone else?\n\u201cYeah, it has real cinematic quality\nbut isn\u2019t a classic game. I enjoyed my\nfirst play-through, but ultimately it\u2019s\nall a bit underwhelming, especially the\ngun-play.\u201d\nRight.\n\u201cI really hated HL2 when I first\nplayed it.\u201d\nAlright, you miserable bastards. Not\na single one of you really came out\nstrong for one of the big hits of the\nyear 2004, but while that was surpris-ing, you still had a wide range of likes.\n\u201cNinja Gaiden was, and is, utterly\nbadass. This was the first console game\nto really push me, and I loved it for it.\nNinja Gaiden gave me challenge, and\nwhen I got past a particularly hard bit\nI felt like the KING OF THE WORLD.\u201d\nBig changes in the console world\nset this year up to be the beginning of\nthe resurgent Nintendo. The DS was\nreleased this year to great celebra-tion, and alongside this came the anGod,you\u2019reamiserablebunch,eh?Rollon2004-theyearofthehatred\nnouncement of the Revolution, the console that\nwould eventually become the Wii. Other than that, the\nGamecube didn\u2019t\nhave that exciting a year - Twin\nSnakes came back to\nNintendo at last, but\nthe real gems were in\nthe future.\nNo, this was the year for the con-soles. Killzone and Halo 2 make up\nthe exclusive headlines for the year\nfor both PlayStation2 and XBox, with\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas proving equally popular once it hit.\nOn the PC, things didn\u2019t look so\ngreat. \u201cYear of the Ill-Received Sequel.\u201d Colt tells us, \u201cInvisible War,\nDeadly Shadows and Doom 3.\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s true that Deus Ex 2 : Invisible War and Doom 3 were both criticised on release, Thief 3 has quite the\nfollowing over here, it seems.\n\u201cWorthy of the Thief name. It really is brilliant and is only just pipped\nby Thief 2. It was quite surprising\nhow good it was actually.\u201d Karan tells\nus, while another reader said: \u201cThief:\nDeadly Shadows. Even though it lost\nthe number (in an effort to attract new\naudiences on Xbox primarily), it was\nstill a worthy sequel. And it looked gor-geous. It was basically shadow porn.\u201d\nWe lost Acclaim this year as they\ndeclared bankruptcy. It\u2019s really a year\nof transitions - the last-gen was dying off. Think of a game that reminds\nyou of being young - from Crazy Taxi\nto the old Turok games - and Acclaim\nprobably had a hand in it. With their\ndeath, and the rise of the big, clever\nand future-looking games, things really changed in 2004. Rome: Total War\nseems to be a good example.\n\u201cA great game. The Rome campaign\nmap made me involved like I\u2019d never\nbeen with Medieval and the AI\u2019s propensity for sending armies to face you\nat bridges meant that I got pretty attached to specific battlefields. And the\nscreaming women and burning pigs\nand head hurlers and war dogs were\namazing.\u201d\nThis is also the year, as many will\nknow, that World Of Warcraft\nlaunched. From there \u2018til today, gaming has never really been the same. The\nMMO formula was finally cracked, coinciding with a burst of new technology that meant WoW could offer an\nexperience that gamers had never had\nbefore.\nNot everyone likes it, but it\u2019s hard to\ndeny its era-defining quality. It\u2019s a standout game of the decade, perhaps not\nfor gameplay but for concept.\nSo, a good year for gaming, but not\nfor games? Feel confused.\nIn Pictures - The Week In News: EA feel the squeeze; wide variety of other stories\nModern Warfare 2 Released\nThat game that\u2019s the sequel to another game that was alright, I guess,\nhas finally been released. So prepare to read NOTHING BUT MW2\nfor the next three weeks online.\nMW2 Ships\nSome game got released this week.\nI dunno. A man on the news talked\nabout it, I guess it sounds pretty fun.\nEA Struggling?\nEA shed 1500 jobs and have cut \u2018the bottom third\u2019 of their games lineup after sales\nfigures hit.\nMW2: is it a game?\nSome non-gamers discussed whether\nModern Warfare 2 might be a bad\ngame because it involves guns and\nquotes by Napoleon.\n\n"

Climate change has\nbecome such a big issue in the media\nthat paradoxically it\u2019s becoming hard\nto take seriously and all too easy to\nignore. As selective hearing steadily slides towards carefree impassiv-ity, there is a real danger of forgetting\nabout global warming altogether.\nWe\u2019ve all done it. You check the BBC\nNews website and see another gargantuan lump of ice has fallen off Antarctica. This promptly jump-starts a fit\nof tutting suffused with a noble desire\nto be the best friend the environment\never had. After faithfully screwing\nin your energy efficient light bulb,\nyou wake up the next morning all too\nhappy to throw away recyclables, leave\nlights on all day and generally spew as\nmuch carbon into the atmosphere as\npossible.\nBut how much effect do these actions really have on what is evidently\na planet-sized problem? Some scientists have suggested that our potentially climate-changing chemical\nemissions are offset by the Earth itself.\nThe Gaia hypothesis loosely describes\nthe Earth as one giant organism, and\nis a theory often hijacked by those unconvinced of climate change or otherwise unwilling to change their ways.\nIn much the same way as the human\nbody will attempt to keep the temperature of the blood constant through\ncertain physiological alterations, the\nEarth is said to be composed of a series of feedback loops that keep the\natmosphere hospitable and conducive\nto life.\nThis is a beautiful idea. It is beautiful partly because it suggests an all-encompassing compassion for all species around the world, but mostly it is\nbeautiful because it means we can do\nwhatever the hell we want with the\nplanet without worrying about the\nconsequences. Mother Earth may be\na tolerant and forgiving parent, but I\nfear the level of damage currently being done might be akin to pushing a\nbottle of gin into her hand and poking\nher with a stick.\nOkay, so this problem isn\u2019t going to\ngo away by itself. But as a race we\u2019ve\ndeveloped the technical genius required to create computers, space\nships and deep-fried Mars bars. Surely\nwe have the know-how to come up\nwith a solution.\nPaul Crutzen, a winner of the Nobel\nPrize for Chemistry, has suggested a\nradical solution involving using high-altitude balloons to supplement the\nstratosphere with sulphur. The sulphur particles would reflect light and\nheat from the sun, effectively cooling\nthe Earth. His idea mimics the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions and\nseems a wonderfully innovative and\nsimple idea. We should, however, be\nextremely apprehensive about any\nsuch schemes of geo-engineering.\nAmong other things, his proposed solution would lead to an increase in acid\nrain, killing millions of fish and huge\namounts of plant life.\nThe fact is that at current rates the\nglobal temperature is set to rise by anything from 2-6O\nC in the next 50 years.\nOur children and grandchildren will\ninherit a world being overwhelmed by\ndeserts, droughts and famine. So do\nrecycle, reuse shopping bags, buy food\nwithout much packaging and turn appliances off instead of putting them on\nstandby. The small things really will\nmake a difference. I know the effect\nof each semi-regurgitated warning becomes ever weaker as our apathy overcomes our better senses. I just don\u2019t\nthink that excuse will cut it.\nJamesBeal\nJamesBeal Science Reporter\nHas the standard \u2018polar bear in broken ice\u2019 photo lost its impact through overuse in the media?\nSome think\nplenty of time.\nWe think\nuse it wisely.\nThinking New Perspectives.\nCredit Suisse is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate in its employment decisions on the basis of any protected category.

The penis was engineered in rabbits using cells from\nthe animals themselves. It enabled the\nrabbits to use the new organs to father\nbaby rabbits.\nWhilst the creation of a penis for a\nrabbit may seem a little bit pointless,\nit is the implication of such research\nthat matters, that of actually being able\nto generate an organ using non-stem\ncells. It helps take scientists closer to\ncreating other complex organs such\nas livers and hearts, organs which are\nquite possibly more critical for actual\nsurvival.\nThe study was led by Dr Anthony\nAtala of Wake Forest Univeristy\nBaptist Medical Center\u2019s Institute\nfor Regenerative Medicine in North\nCarolina.\nDr Atala focused on the penis not\nbecause of a deep-rooted obsession\nwith phallic objects, but because of\nthe fact that he is a urologist who has\nfor a long time specialised in disorders\nand defects of the bladder and sexual\norgans.\n\u201cThat was the inspiration for this\nwork. We are seeing babies born with\ndeficient genitalia all the time. There\nare no good options.\u201d\nDr Atala\u2019s team first created a scaffold for the rabbit penis removing all\nthe living cells from it, leaving only\ncartilage. They then took a small piece\nof tissue from the penis of another rabbit and grew the cells in a lab dish.\nThe work took his team 18 years to\ncomplete. \u201cWe had to find the right\ngrowth factors, the right soup to grow\nthe cells in,\u201d he said\nThe key thing about this research is\nnot that an organ was generated, but\nthat normal animal cells were used\nrather than stem cells, which have the\npotential to generate any cell type but\nalso whose usage in research is limited\ndue to the crazy ethical and religious\nshit that accompanies them (especially\nin America with all their fundamentalist nutters). But anyway, let us rejoice\nin this quite seminal piece of work.\nFunctional penises now able to be grown from animal cells\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\n18\nThe number of years spent\nby Dr Atala in completing\nhis work on the Penis\n\n"

Say hi to Tachyon!\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2009.\nT\nhe Dalai Lama\naddressed tens\nof thousands of\nfollowers in the\ntown of Tawang,\nin Arunachal Pradesh, eastern India.\nThe Tibetan spiritual leader is\non a week-long tour of the region which has brought accusations from Beijing of his tour being an attempt to undermine Chinese authority in Tibet. Many of the people who attended his lecture, held on a packed polo\nground, had been travelling for days, some even coming from neighbouring\nBhutan, for the chance to be enlightened by the exiled Buddhist.\nThe location of the Dalai Lama\u2019s speech is itself controversial, because India\nand China fought a brief border war over parts of Arunachal Pradesh in 1962,\nand the issue has never been resolved. In addition, the Dalai Lama fled from\nTibet via Tawang after the Chinese occupation 50 years ago. The 300 year-old\nmonastery there is one of the most influential outside of Tibet, and lies close to\nthe border between India and China.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont, International Editor\nL\neaders from all over the world have gathered in Berlin on Monday for events commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall 20\nyears ago.\nThe fall of the wall precipitated the end of communist rule in\nEastern Europe, and two years later in the USSR. The wall was a\nsymbol of division between the east and the west of Berlin, Germany, and\nEurope. Its collapse was surprisingly accidental, as East Germans followed\nHungary\u2019s decision to open its borders, the communist government modified\ntravel restrictions that imprisoned them and a flood of more than 3 million\npeople crossed the border, many for the first time.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Berlin, retraced\nher steps on the night the wall fell by crossing what used to be the Bornholmer Strasse checkpoint, the first to open 20 years ago. She was joined\nby other European leaders and former leaders, including ex-Soviet leader\nMikhail Gorbachev, former Polish President Lech Walesa, and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who all held speeches for the event.\nGermany\nT\nhe navies from\nboth countries\nhave reported\nthat some vessels\nbriefly exchanged\nfire at the border.\nSouth Korean officials in\nSeoul explained that the incident began after a North Korean patrol boat crossed the\nwestern sea border, but the North Korean navy has countered that it was on\nits way towards an unidentified object within its borders, when it was suddenly attacked by South Korean ships. The North\u2019s boat \u201clost no time to deal\na prompt retaliatory blow at the provokers\u201d, after which the South Korean\nforces \u201chastily took to flight to the waters of their side.\u201d Both sides have demanded an apology.\nThe countries have had at least two fatal conflicts at sea within the past\ndecade, and neither can agree to fix a sea border. Although no casualties were\nreported this time, the North Korean vessel was apparently set ablaze before\nthe South\u2019s fleet took off. The conflict comes just a few days before Barack\nObama\u2019s visit to Asia, including his first to China.\nNorth & South Korea\nIndia\nI\nmperial College welcomes our\nnew Deputy Rector, Professor\nStephen Richardson, who began his\nnew post on Monday of this week.\nHe is also the Principle of Faculty of Engineering and will now assume both roles\nat the College.\nHaving walked within Imperial walls\nas an undergraduate, post-graduate and\nsenior member of the College Faculty,\nProfessor Richardson is well-qualified\nto declare that \u201cImperial is packed with\ngreat people all the way through, and I\u2019m\nlooking forward to working with all colleagues to set the College\u2019s priorities for\nthe coming years.\u201d He adds to this, \u201cTo\nserve as Deputy Rector is a huge honour\nand I will work very hard to be worthy of\nit, and to advance the academic mission\nof this outstanding College.\u201d\nProfessor Richardson accepted his new\nposition with gratitude and inspiration,\nwhich far humble his previous 30 years\nof work at Imperial. He began his undergraduate studies at Imperial in Chemical\nEngineering, 1969, and went on to complete his PhD in 1975. Once having said\nthat \u201cengineering is in my blood\u201d, it only\nseems natural that Professor Richardson\nhas gone on to become a leader in his\nfield of science. His main area of research\nled him, together with his colleague, to\ndevelop a computer program which has\nsince been used in the design of over 200\nvessel and pipeline installations for the\nproduction of oil and gas. Within his\nown Faculty of Engineering, Professor\nRichardson is fondly referred to by the\nstudents as the \u201cmachine-gun\u201d, to which\nhe is attributed as a result of his tendency\nto talk bullet-quick whenever enthused\nby his ideas.\nSir Roy Anderson, Rector of Imperial,\nsaid, \u201cStephen is a highly popular senior\nacademic, who has shown great dedication to Imperial throughout the more\nthan 30 years he has worked here. He has\nNew Deputy Rector appointed\nbeen an outstanding leader within his\ndepartment and the Faculty of Engineering, and I am delighted that the whole\nCollege will now benefit from his skills.\u201d\nProfessor Richardson aims to present\nhimself as a role model, claiming \u201cMy aim\nis to lead by example, so if I expect other\npeople to do things, I should also do them\nmyself, in some measure. For example: I\nstill teach, I do admin, I do consultancy\nwork and I still conduct some research.\nA balanced diet is what you need in this\njob.\u201d\nThe new Deputy Rector has certainly\nalready spent enough time here at Imperial to understand the philosophy\nbehind what the College does as an\nentity, across all of its disciplines. He\nmaintains a clear ambition for all Imperial students, which is \u201cto see our students go on to be CEOs of companies,\nschool teachers inspiring more kids\u2026\u201d\nEvidently speaking from his own expe-rience, he adds, \u201cGraduates at Imperial\nstill have the very real opportunity to\nmake a difference.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s true, it\u2019s actually this big. My pay cheque, I mean. What were you\nthinking I meant?\u201d\nJoanna Cai\nJoanna Cai News Reporter\n\n"

Murdoch insists that Google is profiteering off of\nstolen News Corp content. What he\nseems to not understand is that yes,\nGoogle does make money from search,\nand perhaps search including News\nCorp articles, but when someone\nsearches for something in his articles\nthey end up going to that article on his\nwebsite. Surely the fact that they can\u2019t\ncapitalise on that is their own prob-lem? Murdoch even went as far as to\nsay:\n\u2018If they\u2019re just search people.... They\ndon\u2019t suddenly become loyal readers\u2019\nMurdoch wants to make all of News\nCorps online content paid for and\nmake users access it directly. Well for\none, I don\u2019t see that actually working\n(would you pay for The Sun online?).\nAnd second of all, if you don\u2019t want\npeople to be able to search your arti-cles, then why not block search engine spider access? It\u2019s pretty simple,\nyou just put a \u2018don\u2019t access this\u2019 in the\nRobots file on your domain and the\nsearch engine will ignore.\nGoogle itself responded to these accusations with a statement to the effect\nof \u2018Whatever man\u2019 telling Mr. Murdoch that all he needs to do is tell Google\nto not index his sites and just as easy as\nthat they\u2019d be removed. What I don\u2019t\nthink Murdoch understands about all\nthis is that without Google and other\nsearch engines leading users to the\ncontent, not many are actually going to\nfind and read the content. OK, a few\ndedicated people might read it like a\nnewspaper, browsing around it, but at\nthe end of the day News Corp content\nfor the most part is hardly unique. People will just go somewhere else rather\nthan pay.\nIn other search news, Google has\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nToday I\u2019d like to introduce you to another student friendly free service that\nhelps you keep your bookmarks, passwords and other things in sync across\nmultiple computers, browsers and\noperating systems. Now this doesn\u2019t\nsound all that exciting but if you\u2019ve\never used a college computer and\nwished you had access to all the bookmarks and passwords you\u2019ve got stored\non your home machine then Xmarks is\nfor you.\nSo what is Xmarks? Well it started as\na plugin for Firefox called Foxmarks,\nwhich simply synced your bookmarks\nbetween Firefox browsers via cloud\nstorage. Of course Firefox isn\u2019t the\nonly browser on the planet and so the\ncompany branched out to other browsers and other platforms including Internet Explorer and Safari on OSX\nand changed their name to Xmarks.\nGoogle\u2019s Chrome on both OSX and\nWindows is also currently supported\nin a limited capacity through a new\nXmarks alpha build and the Chrome\ndev channel, which leaves only Camino and Opera out of the major market\nplayers unaccounted for.\nXmarks essentially gives you a sync\nservice for all your bookmarks across\nmultiple systems and browsers with\none login. Bookmarks are synced\nseamlessly as well as logins and pass-words, if you use Firefox 3, for any and\nall sites that your browser happens to\nsave. The client syncs the data in the\nbackground to the Xmarks servers\nwith encryption to keep your logins\nsafe on their servers and across the Internet. When you next logon to a computer Xmarks updates any changes you\nhappen to have made, allowing you to\ncontinue where you left off, regardless\nof which computer or browser you\nhappen to have in front of you.\nIf you find yourself in front of a computer that you can\u2019t install the sync\nclient on then Xmarks also provides\nyou with a handy online repository of\nall your bookmarks. Simply browse to\nXmarks.com, which includes a mobile\noptimised site, and login to find all\nyour bookmarks laid out for you. This\nis especially handy if you just want to\nshow something to someone on their\nT\nhe ethical issues involved in\npiracy have been in the news\na lot over the last decade or\nso. As the music and film industries tried to come to terms with an\nentirely new distribution format and a\nnew generation grew up with Limewire\nand the Pirate Bay, conflicts sprouted\neverywhere as the industries attempted to strong-arm the file-sharers, only\nto be met with stubborn resistance. At\nthe end of the first decade of the 21st\ncentury, the dust has settled a fair bit.\nThe Pirate Bay lost their court battle\nagainst the recording industry, several\nlarge torrent trackers were shut down\n(with the fate of many more uncertain)\nand Limewire (along with all the adware that is bundled with it) has more\nor less been consigned to history.\nThat said, it appears that the RIAA\nand the MPAA aren\u2019t done yet. In a\nnew piece of legislation that will come\ninto force in the summer of 2011, persistent filesharers can be blocked from\ntheir internet connections as part of\na \u201cthree strikes policy\u201d. This, as the\nname suggests, is an American concept that coincidentally has previously\nonly largely been used on murderers\nand rapists, never before on the average spotty teenager. The implementation of this law therefore, raises some\ninteresting questions. Is your average\nmusic thief banned from using the\ninternet for life? What if he moves\nhouse? What about the people who\nmove into his old house? Can he work\nsomewhere with access to internet or\nis this an all-encompassing burden he\nmust carry with him to his grave? Most\nimportantly, where is he to find quality\nJapanese tentacle porn?\nThe obviously confused man behind this new law, Lord Mandelson,\nhad shown little interest in piracy and\ncopyright issues until he flew to Corfu\nfor a meeting with Dreamworks\u2019 cofounder David Geffen (Dreamworks\nbeing the studio that churns out mediocre animated films that no one has\never really watched). Immediately after his small trip, Lord Mandelson saw\nit fit to attempt to push this law into\nexistence, all the while denying the two\nevents were linked, in the same way\nthat me setting fire to my carpets and\nmy house burning down would not be\nlinked.\nAside from the political aspect of the\nlaw, there\u2019s the issue of innocent users\nincorrectly being identified as illegal\nfilesharers. The ISP TalkTalk, in a recent stunt, showed that roughly 34% of\nwireless connections in your average\nstreet have either little or no security at\nall. Wireless security hasn\u2019t been able to\nkeep up with the explosion in wireless\ninternet; the average user probably has\nno idea about the differences between\nWPA and WEP, and probably doesn\u2019t\ncare. To cut these users off from the\ninternet is rather like permanently banning a supermarket just because there\nwas a shootout in their parking lot. It\nmakes no sense.\nLooking at the broader picture, one\nhas to ask whether such laws are really\nrequired, and whether they add anything in the long term. The meteoric\nrise of Spotify has been a testament to\nthe fact that financially viable free music distribution is possible. By pushing\nthis new law forward as strongly as he\nis doing, Mandelson is taking away any\nincentive the recording companies have\nto innovate and giving filesharers an\nincentive to find smarter ways to beat\nthe system, setting the stage for another\nround of long and bloody legal battles.\nAs we drift along into 2010, it\u2019s worth\nrecalling a relatively small music sharing service that operated between June\n1999 and July 2001, Napster. Facing a\nmassive set of lawsuits from big name\nrecord labels at the turn of the millen-nium, Napster declared bankruptcy\nand slipped into oblivion. Yet the practice of filesharing wasn\u2019t affected much\nas users simply moved on to different\ntechnologies. 10 years on, it appears\nthat the film and recording industries\nhave learnt little, if anything, from the\npast \u2013 and with laws being drawn up\nby politicians who apparently have no\nunderstanding of the underlying issues,\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be an end in sight\nto the vicious cycle.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor computer without overwriting all their\nbookmarks and passwords.\nFor students this means that you can\ncarry your bookmarks for research,\nnotes, articles and of course YouTube\nvideos and time wasters (everyone\nneeds a little break here and there\nright?) between home, college and anywhere else. I would have killed for this\nkind of service in my 1st year simply\nfor research, let alone everything else.\nThe kicker is that it\u2019s totally free, no\ncatch, no ads, just a great service and\nsomething everyone should be using.\nSo what you waiting for?

This\nstarted the tearing down of the Berlin Wall at the hands of iconic crowds\non both sides, amid euphoric scenes.\nThose celebrating in Germany were\njoined by people around the world\nwho saw his as a symbol of the most\ndeadly ideology the world had ever\nseen self-destructing. The rallying cry\n\u201cfive years before the fall of the Berlin\nwall no one could have predicted it\u201d is\nstill used across the globe by seemingly\nweak movements fighting tyranny.\nTwenty years on, it is saddening to\nread a recent global poll of 29000 people by the BBC. It shows that many of\nthe lessons learned from the results\nof seventy years of ignoring the laws\nof human action appear to have been\nforgotten. The poll was conducted to\nassess changing levels of confidence\nin markets over the past two decades.\nThe results, reported in an article titled \u201cFree markets flawed, says survey\u201d\nsuggest that eight out of nine people\nacross the 27 countries surveyed believe that the free market does not\nwork well and that more regulation\nwill make it more efficient.\nThe silver lining is that at least it\nshould help end the absurd idea many\nhave that \u201cbut most people think that\nX\u201d is a legitimate argument for X. But\nthe ignorance shown is sickening given\nthe extent to which the same electorates that typically believe economics\nis a difficult area best left to experts\nare willing to go in endorsing the imposition of policies advocated by one\nschool over others.\nTwenty years after the symbolic end of Communism in Eastern Europe, Business Editor Sina Ataherian looks at\nthe changing public understanding of socialism, markets, economics and government intervention\nEast and West Germans meet on November 9th 1989 to tear down the Berlin Wall and reunite their nation\nas mises.org, home of the prestigious\nLudwig von Mises Institute in the US.\nBut today it is even creeping its way\nslowly but surely into mainstream\nmedia, especially on Reuters and\nBloomberg.\nIn the week that ironically saw both\nthe twentieth anniversary celebrations\nof the fall of the Berlin wall and the\npassing of the Affordable Healthcare\nfor America Act, we should pause to\nconsider the significance of the BBC\npoll. Are the results as bad as may be\nfeared? Many who felt capitalism was\nnot working, such as Michal Moore\nwho has made entire films on the sub-ject, confuse it for the existing system\nof corporatism and special interest\ngroups. In fact, the word capitalism\nsounds like a system that favours capital above the other factors of production and so is unnecessarily confusing.\nAdvocates of free markets should\nemphasise that their position is not to\nserve capital above all else, but to allow individuals to buy and sell what\nthey want on a voluntary basis without\nthe government intermediating. They\nshould make clear that they oppose all\nredistribution \u2013 including from society\nto the banks - and all central planning \u2013\nincluding of the money supply. Again,\nonly the Austrian school has done this\nand so only they can legitimately claim\nto understand and support markets.\nThe government claims to want to\nhelp the poor, yet introduces car scrap-page schemes that destroy the entire\nmarket that they could previously have\naccessed: cheap, old cars. It transfers\nbillions to the same banks that it regulates to stop individuals and smaller\nfirms competing with. It starts unde-gages with taxpayer money. Similar\npolicies have been the sole cause of\nevery artificial boom and subsequent\nbust since the American recession of\n1921. In each instance, coercive mismanagement aftrwards has greatly\nworsened the problem.\nNotice that was the \u2018recession of\n1921\u2019 rather than the \u2018recession of\nthe 1920s\u2019 precisely because the Warren G. Harding administration rightly\nembraced it as the healthy correction\nto First World War over-spending. It\nrecognised the problem as over-priced\nThe recession has served a useful purpose in restricting a zoo of\neconomic schools into two: lazy and\nsound. There is a strong consensus\namongst the exuberant crowds that the\nfinancial crisis was caused by a lack of\nregulation. Most politicians and their\ncourt intellectuals pander to this view\nrelentlessly. At the same time, anyone\nwilling to spend sometime thinking\nthrough what happened and why, is\nin for a treat. It is easy to see that the\nAustrian school is unique in all of its\nleading figures predicting the events of\n2008 in great detail years before they\noccurred.\nFor the first time in a while, the incentive for individuals to favour sound\nover lazy economics is obvious \u2013 not\nbeing caught out the next time state\nintervention messes up the economy.\nMuch as the likes of Summers and\nStiglitz would like to pretend other-wise, free markets will always exist in\none form or another, and especially in\nthe analysis of current affairs. In the\npast non-economists who got confused\nby Krugman\u2019s New York Times articles\nadvocating a housing bubble (precisely\nhis words) may have turned to similar\nwriters dominating big media. After\nseeing that each was as nonsensical as\nthe next, they may have concluded that\nthe subject must just be too complicated for them to understand.\nBut more recently, analysis that cuts\nthrough the spin and explains in an\nintuitively convincing and exact way\nthe causes of economic woes and predicts the effects of further screwing\nwith markets has grown exponentially\nin popularity. Such analysis could always be found in sources dedicated to\nadvancing rational scholarship, such\nclared wars promising quick victories\nand ends up staying aimlessly for potentially decades. If you can see that\nthere is something amiss in all this, but\ncannot see an alternative, it is because\nwe have never really had one within\nliving memory.\nThe political side of free market advocacy may be the most impassioned,\nbut it is unlikely to get us anywhere,\nas individuals. Instead, we can rely on\nthe principle that any informational\nadvantage tends to yield material re-turns. In this case, rejecting anti-mar-ket propaganda confers two immediate benefits. It helps us understand the\ntrue value of jobs that rely upon open\nand fair competition and thus be more\ninclined to go after them. Almost as\nimportantly, this rejection will enable\nus to accurately predict the real affects of government policy in any line\nof business that we may chose to enter.\nThe recent financial crisis saw panicked Keynesians and assorted other\npro-Fed sidekicks gain an early upper hand. They established into our\nconventional wisdom the idea that\nbecause banks are associated with\nmarkets and with the crisis, we can\nconclude the crisis was itself caused\nby markets, especially unregulated\nones. This is therefore a good place\nfor anyone interested in uncovering\nthe link between damaging markets\nand causing damaging to the economy\nto begin.\nThe recession, great or otherwise,\nwas caused by the US government\ncombining the fraud of paper-money\nprinting (in legal tender currency that\nwe would be imprisoned for not using)\nwith the theft of guaranteeing mort-assets, an increase in risk-aversion,\nand liquidity issues for firms and their\ncustomers. These are all problems that\nfree markets naturally incentivise entrepreneurs to solve. Unlike all predecessor administrations to date, it did\nnot pick out the one saving grace of\nrecession \u2013 lower price levels \u2013 as the\nproblem to \u2018correct\u2019.\nOf course it is always tempting to\nend our studies here and revert to lazy\neconomics, where we assume the people whose views get the most coverage\nmust be right. If their thoughts are too\nincomprehensible to be worth explor-ing, we may think it is because we lack\nthe ability to understand and give up.\nBut it is extraordinarily dangerous to\nassume something is as it is for reasons\nbeyond our comprehension.\nIt is interesting that these pseudo-economists tend to be from universi-ties, and so are hardly unbiased commentators on government spending.\nThey have never had to test their ideas\nin real markets. Far greater sympathy for sound reasoning can be found\namongst those who do so regularly, in\nplaces such as Mises or Bloomberg.\nEconomists who argue that we fail to\nunderstand the situation should verify\nthis by at least attempting to enlighten\nus. More and more people are now\ndemanding his, and educating them-selves, which would explain support\nfor auditing the \u201cFederal\u201d Reserve, currently sanding at 75% amongs Americans. The obvious signs of discomfort\nin Bernanke\u2019s body language on his\ntours earlier this year to campaign for\nFed \u2018independence\u2019 left us wondering whether the sneers are merely attempts to cover deep insecurity.\nRaegan delivering his famous \u2018tear down this wall\u2019 speech in 1987\n\n"

Heavily\ninfluenced by the 90\u2019s pop scene,\ntheir forthcoming album The Spell\nstrives to recreate that feel good\nvibe. The track Fascination, from\ntheir first album This is Alphabeat\nreached number 6 in the UK chart\nlast year.\nS: Stine Bramsen Simonsen (Lead\nvocals)\nR: Rasmus Nikolai Nagel Nielsen\n(keyboards)\nD\nanish pop-stars Alphabeat reveal a love of a rye\nbread rider and how it is\nimpossible to be a popstar in Denmark... Stuart\nHiggins interviews lead singer Stine\nand keyboard player Rasmus before\ntheir last gig at the end of their current\nUK tour.\nAlphabeat is quite an unusual name,\nwhere did it come from?\nS: It was our bass player, Andreas R.\nWe were playing around with words\nand liked the alphabet and the visuals it brought to mind. The whole\nchildren\u2019s way of looking at the alpha-bet, it\u2019s quite colourful. And then we\nthought of Alphabet Street by Prince,\nplayed around with the word and it became Alphabeat.\nHow did you guys get to know each\nother, were you friends beforehand?\nR: It was our singer Anders SG and\ndrummer Troels who started things\noff and got together. And Troels knew\nAnders and Anders... (There are three\nAnders).\nThat must be quite confusing?\nR : Yeah! And that was about 8-9 years\nago, and then Stine and I joined about\na year later, so we\u2019ve been Alphabeat\ntogether for about 7-8 years now. It\nwas formed from early high school.\nHow do you write songs? Does it begin with a particular melody or lyric?\nS: That\u2019s actually very different this\ntime round. For the old album it was\nmainly our guitarist Anders B who\nwrote most of our songs, and we would\nfinish them off in the rehearsal space.\nR: We\u2019d then go directly into the stu-dio. But this time round we\u2019ve been\nwriting and producing at the same\ntime in our home studio.\nS: So the forming of sound and song\nis entwined into one. The new album\nsounds more synthetic, one hundred\npercent pop this time.\nYour new single The Spell has just\nbeen released in the UK. What\u2019s it\nabout?\nS: It\u2019s a love song, like most of our\nsongs. We like classic lyrics about love,\nand like the title suggests, you\u2019re supposed to be under a spell \u2013 something\nuniversal that everyone can relate too.\nAnd then, it\u2019s of course inspired by\nearly 90s pop...\nR: ...artists such as Black Box, and the\ntrack Get Serious by Cut and Move.\nWe were definitely influenced by the\nwhole house piano thing.\nS: Anders SG wrote it and is debuting\nas a singer songwriter type, which is\ncool. We also tried to put a bit more\nmodern pop into the album. We love\nBritney and Rhianna, all of that American pop.\nWhat are the differences between\nplaying a gig in Denmark or the UK?\nS: In general the fan culture is very\ndifferent. In Denmark you can\u2019t really\nbe a popstar, you can\u2019t really idolise\nanyone because it\u2019s such a small coun-try. No matter how famous a person\nis, you\u2019ll always know someone who\nknows them, there\u2019s always a link. So\nyou\u2019re not really impressed, or at least\nyou\u2019re not supposed to be. It\u2019s fun to\nexperience the celebrity vibe over here,\nthere\u2019s much more screaming.\nDo you have any riders or rituals\nfor gigs? I can\u2019t see any champagne\naround here.\nS: No, we have quite a boring rider\nreally.\nR: Yeah, we\u2019ve just added Rye bread to\nAlphabeat Interview @ Heaven\nit, just to feel a bit... Danish.\nS: We have a little thing that we do before we go on stage, but I\u2019m not sure\nif it\u2019s a secret or not. Did we ever tell\nanyone?\nR: No, I actually think it\u2019s kind of a\nsecret.\nS: We have a little s\u00e9ance.\nR: For like a minute...\nS: But we can\u2019t go into detail...\nHas anything unusual or crazy ever\nhappened at one of your gigs?\nR: We were playing at V-Festival this\nyear and Amy Winehouse was there on\nstage, and Pete Doherty.\nS: They sat on the stage watching our\nwhole show, and then afterwards Pete\nsaid he\u2019d really enjoyed the gig to our\nbass player. It was kind of weird - it was\nthe last person you\u2019d expect to compliment us.\nIf you heard Alphabeat on the radio,\nwould you sing along?\nS: No, I wouldn\u2019t.\nR: Actually, when I heard The Spell\ncome on the radio for the first time, I\ndid turn the volume up.\nS: Oh yeah of course, the first time you\nhear it come on the radio - that was an\namazing feeling. But you only put the\nrecord on when you\u2019re in the process\nof making it. You keep listening to it\nevery day.\nSay you were to meet someone at-tractive, what would be a bigger turn\non, if they said they were a physicist\nor a medic?\nS: Medicine\nR: Yeah medicine!\nOh god, no! No! Wrong answer!\nHere are some quick fire questions:\nLondon or Copenhagen?\nR&S: London\nCoffee or tea?\nR: Coffee S:Tea\nFace2Face\nStuart Higgins speaks with the Danish invaders of the pop scene\nMeaning of life in one word?\nR: Enjoyment S: Love\nBest song ever?\nR: Whitney Houston, all of them.\nS: I want to dance with somebody,\nthat\u2019s probably the best sing ever.\nBill or Ben?\nR&S: Ben\nSunshine or Snow?\nR: Snow S: Sunshine\nFavourite Mood?\nR: Really happy S:Excited/\nfascinated\nAbba or Ace of Base:\nR&S: Ace of Base\nPhysicist or Medic, just to be sure...\nR: Medic\nAre you sure?\nR: Yes\nS: Hmmm... no wait \u2013 it depends who\nI\u2019m talking to.\nThat\u2019s better, but still not perfect...\nWhere would you like Alphabeat to\nbe in one year\u2019s time?\nR: We would definitely like to go to the\nStates at some point, if that\u2019s possible.\nOr just carrying on playing gigs, hopefully sold out - having a good time.\nS: Our new album will be out early\nnext year, and we\u2019re just hoping that it\ngoes really well. I feel really good about\nit and we\u2019re quite proud of what we\u2019ve\ndone and hope people get it.\nAlphabeat\u2019s new single The Spell is out\nnow, to be followed up by their new album early next year.\n:LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::\nFriday Monday\nTuesday\nLISTINGS::\nMuse :: O2 Arena :: Rock\nTegan & Sara :: Shepherds Bush\nEmpire :: Indie Pop\nCarter The Unstoppable\nSex Machine :: The Forum ::\nAlternative Dance\nScratch Perverts/Skream/Benga/\nNoisia :: Fabric :: Electro/Dubstep\nHadouken!/Hijack/A1 Bassline/\nMicky Slim :: Matter :: Dance\nFlo Rida :: Brixton Academy ::\nHip-Hop\nJay Reatard :: The Underworld ::\nSynth-Punk\nStylish Riots :: Camden Barfly ::\nHip-Hop\nDivas Of Motown ::\nHammersmith Apollo :: Motown\n30 Seconds To Mars :: KOKO ::\nEmo\nAlice In Chains :: The Forum ::\nAlternative Metal\nPink Martini :: Hammersmith\nApollo :: Jazz Pop\nAsh :: Gypsy Hill Tavern ::\nAlternative Rock\nFionn Regan :: The Social :: Folk\nArctic Monkeys/Eagles Of Death\nMetal :: Wembly Arena :: Rock /\nIndie\nSeasick Steve :: Brixton Academy ::\nTramp Blues\nAlberta Cross :: Bush Hall :: Rock\nSaturday\nSunday\nPatrick Wolf :: London Palladium ::\nFolk Electronic\nLupen Crook :: The Flowerpot ::\nFolk Rock\nRiverside :: O2 Islington :: Metal\nMelody Gardot :: Royal Festival Hall\n:: Acoustic Jazz Blues\nWednesday\n65daysofstatic :: Heaven :: Math\nRock\nA Place To Bury Strangers :: Garage\n:: Indie Rock\nBlue Rose :: Bush Hall :: Bluegrass\nChipmunk/DJ Luck/ MC Neat::\nMatter :: Dance\nWhite Lies :: Brixton Academy ::\nRocky Alternative Rock\nThe Enemy :: The Forum :: Indie\nGilberto Gil :: Royal Festival Hall ::\nAcoustic\nBBC Symphony Orchestra :: New\nSlang @ McClusky\u2019s :: Classical\nDragonette :: Notting Hill Arts Club\n:: Electropop\nKasabian :: Wembley Arena :: Rock\nDeep Purple :: Hammersmith\nApollo :: Rock & Roll\nAnnie Mac :: KOKO :: Dance\nBeyonce :: O2 Arena :: R&B\nBryan Adams/Gabriella Cilmi/Kiki\nDee :: Rock/Pop\nThursday\nAlpha, Beta, Gamma... wrong Alphabeat!\n\n"

Standing over\nyour defeated opponent with a self-righteous smirk\nof contempt is the main reason\nanyone does anything and this\nis no exception. It doesn\u2019t matter\nhow much you liked the book, how\nmuch you engaged with the plight\nof the characters or how compelling the fiction; at the moment of\ncompletion you cast it asunder and\nlight a cigarette like you just aced a\nmaths test. Or so I thought.I recently\nread a book by S\u014dseki Natsume called\nI Am a Cat. Attracted by the quirky title I bought it on a whim and it sat on\nmy shelf until late summer boredom\nreached critical point and I was forced\nto start reading books and revising\nschool work. So, I picked it up and read,\nand read, and then it was over. It\u2019s by\nno means a short book but it\u2019s the most\nremarkably readable piece of prose I\u2019ve\never come across. And when I reached\nthe end the glory of my conquest was\nthe last thing on my mind, lost beneath\nthe waves of sadness that it couldn\u2019t\nsimply go on forever.\nThe book itself is a translation of a series of articles published in an influential Japanese literary magazine, Cuckoo,\nover the early years of the 20th century.\nWithin them, Natsume follows the life\nof an unloved, unwanted, wandering\nkitten who spends his days observing\nthe human world and commenting on\nhuman nature. Set in a time when Japan\nwas at a crossroad struggling to retain\nindependence from the encroaching\nEuropean empires. The Meiji era saw\nan explosive period of modernisation\nwhere Japan\u2019s borders were opened\nto the world and an influx of western\nvalues and fashions inevitably ensued.\nThis allows Natsume to give a rare\nobjective analysis of the culture upon\nwhich our modern world is built and\nthe often incongruous juxtaposition of\nwestern values and eastern spirituality\nthat the cultural revolution of the 1960\u2019s\nbrought back our way.\nI could quite literally talk for days\nabout the stories themselves; with their\nsurprisingly modern style of the humour,\ncynical deeply philosophical feline narrator and perfect cast of characters. But\nI won\u2019t because, while I would recommend it to anyone, plugging I Am a Cat\nisn\u2019t my main goal here. At Imperial we\nget a lot of work and too often we let that\nget in the way of less important things,\nlike being happy or enjoying ourselves.\nThis of course leaves absolutely no time\nfor spiritual and philosophical develop-ment. Which is tragic since considering\nmost of us won\u2019t become scientists it\nmeans Imperial\u2019s main impact on a lot\nof our lives will be the deep-seated social\nawkwardness and isolationist mindset\nthat permeates the campus. This should\nnot and need not be the case. Natsume\u2019s\ncutting analysis of people, religion, philosophy and our modern world has\nchanged my view on a lot of things, not\nleast that it is possible to miss the reading part of reading a book. Something I\nhad never questioned and here, at last,\nis my point. Don\u2019t let the only questions\nyou consider at your time in Imperial be\nscienific problems; look out at the world\nand into your mind, read quirky books\nand discuss Descartes not for his coordinate axes but for his philosophy. After\nall, you\u2019ll need a world view much more\nthan you\u2019ll need to know how to solve\nthat tricky second order partial differential equation.\nI\narrived at the Finborough theatre rather grumpily (no matter\nhow awesome cowboy boots\nare, they should never been\nworn to walk from Battersea to\nEarls Court) to find I was the first person there; well it was first matinee so\nI didn\u2019t expect a crowd. I had come to\nsee Little Fish- a small scale musical by\nMichael John LaChiusa, a prolific if not\neminent writer in the off-Broadway\nscene. I\u2019ve always found LaChiusa\u2019s writing a bit intellectual just for the sake of\nbeing intellectual and not very riveting.\nTherefore I was dubious about this production but willing to be proven wrong.\nThe theatre has changed a lot since\nI last went; the seating has switched\nsides which makes a lot of sense as the\nentrances are now on the same wall as\nthe set so actors do not have to pass by\nthe audience. The set itself was innovative and made clever use of such a\nsmall space- cupboards appeared from\nnowhere, a bed was concealed within\na cupboard and even anonymous looking frames became swimming pool\nlockers. As has become the fashion\nin off-West End shows, the band were\nplaced above the set which I always\nfind amusing as I enjoy watching the\nmusicians almost as much as the ac-tors. And everything was in blue...\nThe title, Little Fish, was more than a\nbit deceiving. The play actually focuses\non Charlotte, a thirty something New\nYorker who has just given up smoking and her tales on how she got there.\nThe little fish is reference to both\nCharlotte\u2019s new hobby of swimming\nand the feeling that we are all little fish\nin a big world. It is propositioned that\nCharlotte\u2019s smoking habit is due to a\ndoomed relationship with Robert, her\ncollege boyfriend. We see in flashback\nthat Charlotte ran away to New York,\nmade friends and developped relation-ships. In the present, she is trying to\ngive up smoking and occupy her mind\nwith various new hobbies.\nLaChiusa\u2019s score is rich and intelligent but ultimately forgettable bar\na few numbers. The opening number\nDays got me rather excited- a multi\nlayered number with slight jazz influences and a Sondheim-like use of\nrhythm to conjure up the idea of taking\nthe last puff. Another number that got\nme excited was Perfect, sung by Kathy\nas a plea to be treated as anything but\nperfect. There were some awesome\nharmonies and just clever lyrics and\nmusic, another song I\u2019d be interested\nin performing. The benefit of writing\nboth score, lyrics and book are obvious\nin the seamless way they combine\nThe storyline is quite flimsy- the\nshow is definitely more of a character study than a plot driven musical,\nyet the characters, besides Charlotte,\naren\u2019t very well developed. Characters\npop in and out for one or two songs\nseeming superfluous to the plot. Those\ncharacters that do carry Charlotte\nthrough the musical are her friends\nKathy and Marco. Kathy is at one\nminute flighty and journeying to Peru\nand the next minute, the most sensible\nperson in the room. The addition of\na cancer storyline right at the end of\nthe show seemed like LaChiusa suddenly remembering his Theatre 101\nclasses that all musicals must contain\ntragedy. I don\u2019t know whether my gay-dar was failing or whether the writing\nwas failing but I actually thought he\nwas Kathy\u2019s straight boyfriend to start.\nLater on we find that Marco is in a violent relationship. This is, again, added\nright at the end with no resolution but\nis another tick in the box on LaChiusa\u2019s\nend of term Theatre 101 exam.\nDespite the somewhat patchy writ-ing, the cast were brilliant. Julia Worsley holds the show together with an\nunderstated but charged performance\nas Charlotte and was well backed up\nby Laura Pitt-Pulford playing a slightly\nneurotic Kathy. Another standout was\nAlana Maria as the cocaine sniffing,\nboutique owner Cinder with an amazing belt and crazed energy that lit up\nthe stage. The direction was top class,\nAdam Lenson\u2019s use of the space was\ningenious especially in the swimming\nand track scenes, portraying an entire\ntrack or pool only 6 feet from the audi-ence. Although somewhat puzzled by\nit at first, I loved the use of spotlights\nto move the story on and distinguish\nCharlotte\u2019s thoughts from her real\nlife. My only problem was then distinguishing flashback from the present\nas these scenes are scattered throughout play, whenever Charlotte is free\nto think. The choreography was also\nwell thought out with some delightful\ntouches like the use of glitter covered\nfloats in a slight nod to Bob Fosse.\nOverall, Little Fish was not a bad way\nto spend an afternoon but just wasn\u2019t\nmemorable enough - it lacked a sense\nof urgency or just a big push to tell you\nthat this show will affect you beyond\nthe theatre. At times it did make me\nthink of Company- a similar character study although the impetus in this\ncase is much stronger; the need to have\nsomeone to love. Somehow smoking\njust seems too trivial to base a musical\non it, and although it is just the starting point for other stories and tales, it\ndoesn\u2019t hold the show together.\nChristopher Self takes a look at I Am A Cat, learns to enjoy himself and lets go of the Imperial social stigma\nI Can Haz Japanese Literature Pleeze?\n\n"

But should you care? asks Simon Worthington\nA\nh yes, it\u2019s that time of year\nagain. Leaves are falling\noff the trees, the nights\nare drawing in. Halloween? Nope. Christmas?\nHell no! We\u2019re due another Xbox\n360 Fall Update of course! It\u2019s been a\nyear since the New Xbox Experience\nlaunched, and since then we\u2019ve seen\ndownloadable games, an avatar store,\ngames on hard disk and many other\nfeatures besides, but this is the time of\nyear where Microsoft typically release\ntheir latest and greatest developments\nto the public at large. This year sees\nthe uncaging of a myriad of new social networking features, new ways to\naccess music and video and a number\nof subtler changes to the Dashboard.\nThe update is reportedly happening in\nNovember, so we can hope to see these\nfeatures in the next few weeks.\nWhilst not strictly part of the Fall\nUpdate package, some of you may\nhave noticed the new Sky Player has\ndropped onto consoles in the past\nweek or so. From BSkyB (the satellite\nTV people), it will allow you to watch\ntelevision channels and programmes\nlive on your console. The download is\nfree, you\u2019ll need some kind of subscription to actually watch any content: if\nyou\u2019ve already got Sky with the multi-room package then you can start viewing right away, but if you don\u2019t have a\nbox or dish you can subscribe to the\nonline service whose prices start at \u00a315\na month. People who can\u2019t afford that\n(all of us) are stuck with free access to\nSky News.\nBy far the most discussed new feature is Xbox Live\u2019s new Facebook in-tegration. One quick download will\nallow you to log in to Facebook directly where you can access news feed\nitems, update your status and view\nand comment on photos in a cool,\nfull screen slideshow mode. There\nis, however, no support for videos or\nany other applications so any dreams\nof playing FarmVille on your 360 are\nunfortunately scuppered. One of the\ncooler aspects of this feature is that\n\u201cgamers will find\nlittle of interest\u201d compatible games can also post status updates and even upload photos\nor screenshots straight from the game\nitself. The first game to support this\nwill be a future version of the Tiger\nWoods PGA TOUR\u00ae series.\nTwitter also makes its first appearance onto consoles with an Xbox\nscreen allowing you to post tweets,\nread the top fifty tweets from your\nfeed, browse by tag and also view tweet\ntrends. Actually typing tweets however is a massive faff because using the\ncontroller is painfully slow, but this\ncan be alleviated by using the Chatpad\ncontroller add-on or a USB keyboard.\nTwitter, along with Facebook, can be\nfound in an all-new My Community\nsection of the Dashboard, which also\nbecomes home for all the Xbox Live\nevents that happen from time to time.\nThe last social networking feature\nto look out for is integration with the\nmusic discovery service Last.fm. Any\ntracks available to play on the site can\nalso be played on your 360, and all of\nyour favourites and preferences are\nbrought down when you log in. The\nfamiliar features are all there, including the \u2018like\u2019 button, and this information is also sent back to Last.fm\nfor synchronisation. Unfortunately it\nseems unlikely that you will be able\nto play this music outside of the free\ndownload, so anyone wanting to play\nLast.fm stations during games may be\ndisappointed.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Zune music and video\nservice and Xbox Live have never really got along, but all that changes with\nthis update. Zune\u2019s HD video shop will\nallow you to rent 1080p quality movies on your Xbox, and will also allow\nyou to fully purchase movies for the\nfirst time. Content is streamed in HD\ndirectly so there are no lengthy download times and purchased content\ncan be watched on the web or a Zune\nHah! Where\u2019s your evolution of gamers gif now, science editors. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re all modern and social and hip.\n\u201cit takes the XBox\nin a new direction\u201d\nHD device as well. Movies can also be\nwatched in party mode with friends,\nallowing chat during the film.\nApart from a new music store for\nmusic game downloadable content,\nthat\u2019s pretty much the full selection of\nfeatures available this year. Microsoft\nhas clearly tried to take Xbox in a fresh\ndirection with this year\u2019s update to\nestablish it as an all-round entertainment console. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all\nthe new video and music features are\npretty cool, but people who still only\nwant to use their Xbox to actually play\ngames will find little of interest in this\nupdate. If these really are Microsoft\u2019s\nlatest and greatest developments, it\u2019ll\nbe interesting to see if come next year\nthey\u2019ve got any tricks to pull out of the\nhat at all.\nThe Gamers\u2019 Voice - Videogames come over political\nA\nLabour MP stepped into\nthe discussion of Modern Warfare 2\u2019s controversial game sequences\nthis week by creating a\ngroup on Facebook that he described\nas \u201cunashamedly pro-video games\u201d.\nTom Watson, MP for West Bromwich East, started the group apparently in response to Keith Vaz MP\u2019s\ncomments on Modern Warfare 2 in\nthe Daily Mail, where he deemed the\ngame \u2018shocking\u2019 and said he was \u2018particularly concerned about how realistic\nthe game itself looks.\u2019\nWatson\u2019s group, titled The Gamers\u2019 Voice, only has a Facebook group,\nwhere Watson himself admits that \u2018I\ndon\u2019t know how it should work\u2019, but it\nintends to bring the gaming community into the political debate on games\nand become part of the discussion.\nKeith Vaz is well-known in British\npolitics for taking sides in the videogames debate, claiming that the killers\nof schoolboy Stefan Pakeerah had been\ninfluenced by the videogame Manhunt. Amusingly, the investigation into\nthe murder concluded that the only\nperson involved who owned a copy of\nthe game was the victim himself, but\nthis has done little to dampen Vaz\u2019s enthusiasm for games-bashing.\n\u201cLast Thursday, the British Board of\nFilm Classification gave a 15 certificate\nto a video game formerly called \u201cBully\u201d.\u201d he told the Commons back in 2006,\n\u201cThe game contains scenes of violence,\nincluding scenes of players terrorising\nteachers and students, teachers being\nhead-butted and the aggressive use of\nbaseball bats. Currys has banned it.\nGiven the link between video games\nand a propensity to encourage violence\nthat some research has demonstrated,\nwill the Prime Minister convene a\nmeeting of stakeholders\u2014including\nrepresentatives of the industry and\nparents\u2019 groups\u2014to discuss the issue?\u201d\nThe problem stems from Vaz\u2019s claim\nthat research has demonstrated a link\nbetween video games and an increased\ntendency to violence. It\u2019s a point made\nagain and again worldwide, but never\nreally investigated or pulled apart.\nHand-waving and vague assertions are\noften made, and that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed\nto convince people reading the Daily\nMail\u2019s articles on Modern Warfare 2.\nWatson\u2019s group wants to solve these\nproblems, not through immature campaigning and shouting but through di-alogue, examination of the issues, and\na discussion of misunderstandings that\nhave already occured.\nIn this writer\u2019s opinion, neither side\nis really prepared to discuss the topic,\nand Watson may have quite a job on\nhis hands. Parliament will be unlikely\nto make large concessions in the face\nof heightened media interest, which\nthe mass media always affords discus-Keith Vaz has been critical of videogames - Watson hopes to challenge him\nsion of violence in games. Similarly,\nmany games may find themselves unprepared for dialogue too.\nAlthough the group - which has nine\nthousand members at the time of writing - is full of enthusiastic wall posts\nand messages of support, many gamers\nare expecting a walkover, where politicians immediately see the light and\ncome to see gaming in the same way\nthat its proponents do. It\u2019s the same\nmistake that Vaz has made in the past\n- the truth is that neither party is going to have an easy time. What Vaz has\nfailed to do in the past is make any con-cessions. If gamers are willing to propose solutions and - crucially - accept\ncertain compromises, then we may really be looking at a brighter future for\nthe PR face of the games industry.\n\n"

Take the Creation\nof the World, for instance.\nWe are happy to refer to the\nGreek, Norse or Chinese versions of\nthis event as \u2018mythology\u2019\n, whereas even\nthe most devoutly atheistic of us will accord a special status to the account set\nout in Genesis. A distinction made for\npurely cultural reasons \u2013 not because\nthe Judeo-Christian timeline makes any\nmore sense than the others. Well, we\nshould at least be grateful nobody ever\ncame up with a specifically English version of the Creation myth...\nIn the beginning God created the\nheaven and the earth. And the earth was\nwithout form, and void; and darkness was\nupon the face of the deep. And the Spirit\nofGodmoveduponthefaceofthewaters.\nAnd the Lord said: \u2018let there be light\u2019\n.\nAnd the electrician said: \u2018I can fit you in\non Thursday, at around 3.\u2019\nAnd the Lord said: \u2018Thursday? That\u2019s\nno bloody good to me \u2013 I\u2019ve got to bring\nthe land forth from out the sea, cause the\nfirmament to shine with the lights of a\nmillion stars and create all the creatures\nthat swim in the water and fly in the air\nby Thursday.\u201d\nAnd the electrician said: \u2018Sorry, guv\u2019nor\n\u2013 it\u2019s not up to me. What you\u2019ve got \u2018ere is\na decontracted spindle, y\u2019 see. That could\ntake - what, a week, a week and \u2018alf to re-place? Ain\u2019t that right, Eric?\u2019\nAnd Eric said \u2018yerr.\u2019\n\u2018Bu-ut, because I likes you, y\u2019see, we\nmight be able to fix it all up by Thursday.\nBut that\u2019s the fastest I can do\u2019\n, said the\nelectrician. \u2018Nasty business, decontracted\nspindles.\u2019\n\u2018Yerr,\u2019 said Eric. \u2018Very.\u2019\n\u2018Well, couldn\u2019t I have some sort of replacement?\u2019 Quoth the Lord. \u2018I mean,\nit\u2019s all very well you talking about decon-tracted spindles, but it\u2019s bloody hell trying\nto create a Universe if you can\u2019t even see\nwhat you\u2019re doing.

Made a right mess last week when\nthefuseblew.Isn\u2019ttheresomesortoflighting I could borrow in the meantime?\u2019\n\u2018I see\u2019 said the electrician. \u2018Well, it just\nso \u2018appens we do have a variety of replacement illyoominashun apparatus in stock,\nguv\u2019nor.

Heathen, if you ask me.\u2019\n\u2018Oh bollocks.\u2019 Said the electrician. \u2018Well,\nI\u2019m h\u2019awfully sorry, guv\u2019nor, but I don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019ll be h\u2019able to furnish you with\nyour replacement h\u2019illyoominashun service at the present time.\u2019\n\u2018Is there nothing you can do for me?\u2019\nCried the Lord.\n\u2018What d\u2019you think I am, guv\u2019nor \u2013 a\nbloomin\u2019 miracle worker?\u2019\nAnd the Lord knew that there was a\nwitty comment that would be appropriate\natamomentlikethis,butcouldnotforthe\nlife of him remember what it was. Oh yes.\n\u2018Piss off,\u2019 said the Lord.\nAnd Eric and the electrician did piss off.\nAndtheeveningandthemorningofthe\nThursdaydidtheLordwaitimpatientlyby\nhis telephone. And the edges of the fingernails which he bit dropped onto the land\nbeneath and became the mountains and\nthe valleys.

Hello. Is this Mr. J. Hova?\u2019 said\na nasal voice.\n\u2018Yes, it is I\u2019 said the Lord. And on reflection added \u2018or should that be \u2018me\u2019?\u2019\n\u2018You see, Mr. Hova, I\u2019m from the local\nbranch of the RSPCA. Err \u2013 where are\nyou, exactly?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019m standing over here,\u2019 rumbled the\nLord.\n\u2018Ah yes \u2013 thank you, sir. I\u2019m from the\nRSPCA, and I\u2019m here to follow up on a\nnumber of complaints that have been\nmade about your property.\u2019\nThere was quiet. A deep, profound\nstillness broken only by the sounds of\nan ostrich tripping over a pelican in the\ndarkness.\n\u2018What sort of complaints?\u2019 asked the\nLord, groping around for a cuttlefish he\nhad put down only a few minutes ago.\n\u2018Well, Mr. Hova, is it true that you\nare keeping one of the world\u2019s largest\nmenageries of exotic birds confined in\nutter darkness, lasting from moment-when-darkness-is-supposed-to-start to\nmoment-when-darkness-is-supposedto-finish?\u2019 asked the inspector as he sat\ndown on a penguin, mistakenly beliiev-ing it to be a cushion.\n\u2018Ah, well \u2013\u2019 started the Lord\n\u2018And is it also true, Mr. Hova, that a\nnumber of particularly fine species of\nmaritime life are forced to endure existence in a body of water where they are\nnot receiving enough light to survive?\u2019\nthe voice continued.\n\u2018Yes, but that\u2019s all temporary. You see,\nI\u2019ve only just moved in to the neighbourhood and my lighting isn\u2019t sorted\nout yet \u2013 the electrician should be\naround later today, as a matter of fact.\u2019\n\u2018Is that so, Mr. Hova. Is that so.\u201d said\nthe inspector. The penguin squawked,\nloudly. The inspector jumped up and\ntripped, heavily.\n\u2018No no, Mr. Hova, I\u2019m afraid these\nconditions are quite appalling. I\u2019ll be\nback at the same time tomorrow, and\nif things haven\u2019t sorted themselves\nout then I will take steps to have your\nplanning permit for this little Universe\nrevoked. Good undefined-timespan,\nMr. Hova.\u2019 And the inspector did turn\nsharply on his heel and fall flat on his\nface in the Aegean Sea.\nAnd the Lord sighed and said: \u2018If you\nwant to get anything done in this coun-try, you\u2019re better off doing it yourself.\u2019\nGilead Amit blasphemes. Ish. Just a smidge\n\u201cAndtheLordsaid:\n\u2018lettherebelight\u2019,\nandtheelectrician\nsaid:\u2018Icanfityou\ninonThursday,at\naround3:00\u201d\nI\nhave Facebook. No, I didn\u2019t\nthink that would come as a surprise to you either. I also have a\nblog. I can see some raised eyebrows in the back, but it seems\nthat blogging is fairly normal too. OK,\nwhat about if I told you that I have\nTwitter and frequently use it? Yep, just\nas I predicted: most of you are snigger-ing. What\u2019s so funny about it, though?\nMost people who dismiss Twitter as\npointless and laughable mumble something along the lines of, \u201cWhy do people need to know what you\u2019re doing all\nthe time?\u201d. Well, they don\u2019t, but I could\napply exactly the same argument to\ncertain people who frequently blog, or\neven constantly update their Facebook\nstatuses. Apparently, broadcasting\ninanities on Facebook is acceptable,\nwhereas tweeting is not.\nThat\u2019s not to say that said inanities\nshould be posted on Twitter, either.\nContrary to popular belief, most people don\u2019t tweet things like \u201chavin my\ndinner lol\u201d. Many Twitter users post\nlinks that they think would be of general interest to their followers, or directly\ncommunicate with each other using @\nreplies, as well as answering the question Twitter asks on its homepage:\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d. To pick at random from my homepage at the mo-ment, one of the people I\u2019m following\nhas failed her ECDL, another is asking\nhis followers what colour HeartBeats\nhe should buy, and yet another is looking forward to her English Language\nlesson. To quote a certain Sue Denim\n(any Robots In Disguise fans in the\nroom? Nope, I didn\u2019t think so either)\ntweeting is like leaving your curtains\nopen, and following is the equivalent\nof peeking inside. Part of the appeal of\nTwitter is that it\u2019s a bit like a legal way\nof stalking someone, and who doesn\u2019t\nindulge in the odd bout of Facebook\nstalking? Plus, if you want to follow\ncelebrities, you can, safe in the knowledge that they won\u2019t file a restraining\norder.\nIf I had to classify websites, I would\nput Twitter somewhere between blogging and social networking. I asked\nthe student union here a question via\nTwitter before I arrived as a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed fresher. Ashley\nBrown himself tweets. Other people\nuse Twitter for slightly insane projects.\nThe artist Johanna Basford, who got\nher followers to submit ideas for a\n\u2018Twitter Picture\u2019. I suggested a chicken\nwalking along holding an umbrella, for\nexample, which is now sandwiched between a laughing Buddha and a llama\nin the final picture.\nI\u2019ll freely admit that Twitter isn\u2019t for\neveryone. Gaining followers is pretty\ndifficult in itself. People you start following might follow you back, but the\nchances are fairly slim in general, and\nclose to nil if it\u2019s a celebrity. Most of my\nfollowers are bots of some sort.\nI\u2019m not telling you to rush out and get\nTwitter. Just let me tweet in peace, OK?\nEmilieStammersthinkssheisnotatwit\n\u201cI suggested a\nchicken walking\nalong holding an\numbrella... which\nis now... in the final\npicture\u201d\n\n"

Two local Tanzanian\nvolunteers, Chris and Ally, felt great\npain seeing youths in their community\nforgotten due to their lack of educa-tion. In 2003, they took action and\nfounded TEKUA, which provides free\nlessons in English, Computing, Art and\nSocial Education.\nThey believed that education was\nthe key to success, and that TEKUA\nwould aid young people in obtaining\nthe necessary opportunities to suc-ceed. TEKUA has been educating its\nstudents against the struggles of pov-erty, illiteracy and the dangers of HIV\nwhich, unfortunately, for many Africans is still a death sentence.\nThe road has been far from easy,\nChris and Ally have struggled to run\nand sustain the Centre. It depends\nmainly on external charitable support\nsuch as Helping Africa 100. This is unsustainable and TEKUA has had many\nfinancial difficulties. When asked\nabout their future plans, many students answered that they hope to get\nexternal sponsorship to fund higher\neducation. However, this is not always\npossible, and this is where SIFE came\nin!\nSIFE\u2019s philosophy is \u201cgive me a fish, I\neat for a day, teach me to fish, I eat for\na lifetime.\u201d It is a global network joining university students and business\nleaders that together empower others\nto become self-sustainable through\nknowledge transfer and entrepreneur-ship. There were three aims: to first\ndiffuse the culture of dependency on\ndonations through our SIFE Vocational Programme. Secondly, to enable\nthe Centre to become more financially\nindependent through an Art Consultancy Project on the Centre\u2019s art business (their only self- generated income\nactivity, which sells TEKUA students\u2019\nartwork) and thirdly, to teach English\nIN THE CONTINUING SERIES OF IMPERIAL STUDENTS\nSERVING THE WORLD AROUND THEM, SIFE STUDENTS\nMELISSA NG, HANAN L\u2019ESTRANGE-SNOWDEN, ALEXANDRA HO,\n& SAHIL CHUGANI CREATE SUSTAINABILITY IN TANZANIA\nTHROUGH THE POWER OF ENTERPRISE\nand Computing.\nIn the Vocational Programme, we\ntaught CV, letter writing and interview skills. We also taught them how\nto make savings through small- scale\nbusinesses, allowing self-funding of\nfurther education rather than waiting\nfor \u2018sponsorship\u2019. The students had a\nsimulated art sale within the Centre,\nand real life practice at the local market selling maize and bananas. They\nhave learnt that it is possible to realise\ntheir dreams, to become the teachers,\nchefs, and tour guides that they aspire\nto be, in a self-dependent manner.\nTake one of our students- Mary\nGabrielle established her own banana\nbusiness and passed her interviews to\nenter a Vocational Cooking School.\nAnother, Emanuel Geoffrey, is establishing a hair salon. Due to the success\nof our summer programme, we are\nworking with the centre to permanently integrate it into the school curricu-lum, which will be taught by students\nwho graduated this September.\nThe Art Consultancy Project identified the reasons for the lack of profit\nin the past few years. To improve rev-enue, the project revamped the art\nshop, rebranded their marketing strategy and reviewed their pricing and accounting system. The once muddy and\nunwelcoming TEKUA art shop is now\nclean and inviting. A signpost has been\nerected and brochures distributed to\nnearby hotels. To expand their market\nscope, we are now identifying further\nopportunities for TEKUA in London\nfor the sales of their original paintings,\ngreeting cards, jewellery and bags.\nThis would ensure long term and stable sales for TEKUA. As we have in the\npast, we will also be holding art exhibitions to further help the sales of their\nartwork.\nWe didn\u2019t change TEKUA overnight,\nbut we are making a noticeable differ-ence. We hope that we have inspired\nthese youths just as much as we have\nbeen inspired by their optimism and\ndetermination despite all the adversities\nthey face.\n\u201cThey have learnt\nthat it is possible\nto realise their\ndreams, to become\nthe teachers, chefs,\nand tour guides\nthat they aspire to\nbe.\u201d\nCARVING A\nFUTURE\nIN TANZANIA\nCongratulations to all 10 who volunteered this summer - Alexandra Ho,\nAlex Shen, Edward Poynton, Hanan\nL\u2019Estrange-Snowden, Heather Wong,\nHe-In Cheong, Janice Luo, Melissa Ng,\nSahil Chugani and Sammy Ho.\nOur best wishes go to all the staff and\nstudents at TEKUA who will always\nstay in our hearts - Chris, Ally, Pendo,\nHarry, Eczekiel, Lea and Tenopa.\nOur special thanks go to IC Trust, IC\nSummer Tour Fund, Deloitte and Rotary Club Fund who provided financial\nsupport. Our deepest appreciation goes\nto everyone who made this project pos-sible- Khushbu Lalwani, Garrie Bolton,\nMary Goudge, Krishna Bakhai, Paulharveer Singh, Suraendher Shanmuganathan, Raghav Saboo, Advait Rao,\nKathleen Pheasant, and Swiri Konje.\nThis project runs throughout the\nacademic year and over the summer\nin Tanzania. SIFE also runs other UK\nbased projects from working with\nyouths and single mothers, to tackling\nenvironmental issues and encouraging\nscience entrepreneurship. New project\nideas are always welcome too.\nJoin SIFE Imperial (ranked 4th in UK)\n, and transform the lives of others and\nyour own simultaneously through the\npower of volunteering and enterprise!\nMaybe even represent UK in the SIFE\nWorld Cup 2010.\nThe Imperial College TEKUA Project team and the TEKUA Centre\u2019s volunteering staff after a day\u2019s work of teaching the\n15 -30 year olds ready to DalaDala back to Makumira for some Ugali na Kuku and a Serengeti beer mmmmm...\nPHOTOS BY SAHIL CHUGANI\n\n"

I\u2019d had less than one hour\u2019s\nsleep and was very hung-over. At\nthis point, I was seriously wondering why I\u2019d martyred myself to help\nmy dad film the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. This is the longest running\nmotoring event in the world (2009 was\nits one-hundred-and-thirteenth year),\nand veteran cars made before 1904 travel\nfrom all over the world to take part in reliving the first ever \u201clong distance\u201d car\ntrip. It is immortalized by the 1953 film\nGenevieve, filled with sun, lots of old cars\nand a drunk woman trying to play \u201cthe\nplumpet\u201d (trumpet).\nHowever, what I was experiencing was\nnot a rose-tinted view of sun and old\nautomobiles. Frankly, I was very cold, it\nwas windy and I wanted a coffee from\nStarbucks. Did I mention it was raining?\nIt was drizzling; a bleak, Irish-style rain\nthat kept most onlookers away apart from\nthe professional cameramen. These men\nlooked like club bouncers and had lenses\nabout a foot long; the Nixon equivalent\nof a Ferrari in manly compensation. The\nonly other people around were police and\ntwo girls dressed as witches coming back\nfrom a Halloween party, one of whom\nstopped to take a drunken picture. Overall, it was a depressing scene but with an\nair of expectation.\nAfter about half an hour, the sunrise\nwas stunning \u2013 a beautiful blaze of pink\nover the Eye, which even my vodka-narrowed eyes could appreciate. Actually, it was a shame not more people were\nwatching because when the first cars\ncame up over the bridge, mingled with\nLondon buses and modern traffic, they\nlooked rather good. The oldest cars came\nfirst, tiny delicate little motor vehicles,\nsome powered by steam, wound up the\nbridge at 10mph towards us, set against\nthe sun rising over Big Ben. Even me,\nwho knows nothing about cars, was impressed at 104 year old cars navigating inner London. Being used to seeing lots of\nostentatious cars around South Kensington, I also enjoyed the different kind of\nshow put on by these old cars. Travel has\ndefinitely moved on during the century;\nwe get pissed off when our AC breaks\nwhen some of these cars couldn\u2019t even\nmake it up the hill and had to be rescued\nby bemused RAC vans.\nCadillacs, a fire engine and many more\nall motored past us at a very slow speed.\nI had a chance to space out; imagining a\ntime when a drive to Brighton from London was an ambitious journey. For a start,\ntravel back then took so much longer!\nWhat we would class a long journey (for\nme, I guess this would be the twenty-three hour long flight to Australia),\nwould probably be the same as London\nto Scotland for someone living in 1904.\nThe documented trip my great great (etc.)\ngrandmother made as a convict to Australia took four weeks in a ship \u2013 a month\ntravelling would be a much bigger chunk\nout of your life, and for her, the start of a\nwhole new one.\nLondon to Australia aside, the cars that\nhadn\u2019t broken down in Hyde Park (the\nstart), were passing me in more frequent\nnumbers now. Some were steam driven\nand eerily silent, others sounded weirdly\nlike lawnmowers. Most drivers had recruited passengers, who all seemed to be\nsmiling and waving despite being soaked.\nAfter the four-hundred-plus cars passed,\nit was time to follow them in a much\nmore modern car.\nThe rain continued as the cars made\ntheir way out of London and I tried to\nread the map as our TomTom had failed.\nThis highlighted how much I rely on that\nthing to get around; I had no idea how to\nnavigate without a female voice saying \u201cAt\nthe end of the road (pause) turn right\u201d. I\ndrive around with no idea of where I am\nhalf the time, relying on a GPS signal\nfrom a satellite to guide me to Tescos. In\ndad\u2019s Ford Ka, trying to stab the re-set\nbutton on the TomTom with an earring,\nI felt even further from the cars in front\nthat didn\u2019t even have door-handles or\nwindows, let alone an automated female\nvoice to direct them.\nConsidering the weather, quite a few\npeople had come out to watch us pass.\nThe children in particular looked at the\ncars like they were made at NASA; it was\nso unlike what they were used to seeing on the London ring roads. For once,\ntravel by car seemed less like a small nonevent during the day and more like an uncertain adventure. The street was lined\nwith cars that had run out of steam or wa-ter, had wet brakes or gear failure or any\nRacking in karma being Daddy\u2019s Girl\nOlivia Davies travels on a seven-hour drive to Brighton tailing a 1904 Cadillac in the 2009 LBVCR\nof the other multitude of odd problems\nthat occur with cars that often had what\nlooked suspiciously like a big bike chain\nunderneath them to turn the wheels.\nThis novel uncertainty, in place of the\n\u201cyou have arrived at your destination\u201d\nrobot style transportation, was vaguely\nexciting.\nWe made several stops along the way,\none in Crawley on the outskirts of London where all the cars congregated in\na tiny car park. Old style banners displaying adverts for American \u201clube\u201d\nwere hung up, and all the men were\ndrinking pints in the pub (I think possibly the drivers were still in the mindset of the old style drive-thru liquor\nstores...). Surprisingly, there were lots\nof different people there, not just the\nslightly geeky and loveable enthusiasts.\nYoung guys with full leather motorcycle gear were riding the (slightly more\nbike-like) oldest cars, loud Americans\nwere talking about different paint jobs\nand authentic trimmings, and I saw a\nreally cute couple under the rug of an\nold black and yellow Ford.\nAbout seven hours later, and after another stop at a Welcome Break\nfor Krispy Kremes (me) and an M&S\nsandwich (dad), we arrived in Brighton. I rode in one of the finishing cars,\nsquashed in the back between two\nDutch people. We passed though a\nline of people on the Madeira Drive\nwalkway along the beach and got interviewed by a man over the tannoy. For\nsome people who I heard interviewed,\nit was their fourteenth time completing the run. Getting out of the car, I\nwalked down to the beach. I had been\nto Brighton once before but had forgotten its \u201crun-down-but charming\u201d ap-peal. Fish and chips were everywhere,\nas were those sugary hot donuts that\nevery sea-side has. \u00a31 stores ruled, and\nthe pier, sticking out into the sea, was\nfilled with rides and arcades. For me, it\nwas the sea that really stood out \u2013 a big\nraw grey expanse of waves that was so\ndifferent from London streets. Christmas lights were already up, and they\ntwinkled dully as I walked back up to\nthe cars.\nBack where the cars were parked,\npeople were all talking about the run. It\nlooked like we had it good going up, as\nsome people had taken more than nine\nhours due to many rescues by the RAC.\nCoffee was handed out, and an apparently traditional beer that tasted a bit\nlike Hoegaarten.\nAfter about an hour though, we went\nhome. This journey took about three\nhours, and before I knew it I was being\ndropped off back at South Kensington. It\nfelt so strange to be back in London after\na whole day travelling to a destination\nI only spent an hour at. On the back of\nmy bus map, there is an advert for IKEA\nthat says \u201cTravel is a means to an end.\nHome.\u201d In the case of our return jour-ney, this was definitely true; I couldn\u2019t\nwait to get back into my room and warm\nup after a whole day being wet. On the\nway there though, travel was purely for\nthe travel. The seven-hour journey was\nall about the cars, with Brighton\u2019s pier as\nfinal destination only a quick interlude\nbetween the main journey there and the\njourney back. It was a cold, wet and long\nday but it did bring home to me the satisfaction of actually working to get from A\nto B. It was also a chance to step back to\na time when travel was an event in itself.\nFor more information, check out\nhttp://www.lbvcr.com\nCramped in the back behind two quintessential \u2018car enthusiasts\u2019\n\n"

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 13 NOVEMBER 2009\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk FILM\nWelcome to the Cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re: French film heaven\nO\nk, so you think you\u2019ve\nfound all your local cin-emas; the rip off Odeon\non High Street Ken, the\nslightly less dear Cineworld on Fulham Road and even the\nElectric Cinema in Notting Hill. But if\nI were to tell you that the nearest cinema to college was just down road you\nwould probably look at me blankly (not\nnecessarily in disbelief!). Let me introduce you to the Cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re, your\nmost accessible location to keep up on\nWorld and European cinema.\nCin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re is based at the Institut\nfran\u00e7ais du Royaume-Uni in South\nKensington which is the official French\ngovernment centre for language and\nculture in the UK. It is one of 150 Institutes worldwide and one of the\noldest. Beyond its primary mission\nto promote French language and cul-ture, the Institut is also committed to\nencouraging cross-cultural exchange,\nand to the promotion of European and\nWorld culture. Comprising a language\ncentre, multimedia library and a cin-ema, it welcomes thousands of people\neach year.\nRecently refurbished and reopened\nby Catherine Deneuve in January 2009,\nCin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re, the Institut\u2019s cinema, has\nestablished itself as one of London\u2019s\ntop repertory cinemas. With a particular emphasis on French, European and\nWorld cinema, its programme combines new releases, repertory screen-ings, previews and exclusive on-stage\nevents attended by directors and ac-tors. Recent guests include Fran\u00e7ois\nOzon, Sophie Marceau, Jude Law, Bertrand Tavernier, Mathieu Amalric and\nPatrice Ch\u00e9reau. Among the annual\nfestivals it programmes or hosts are\nthe French Film Festival, Spanish Film\nFestival, London Film Festival and the\nMosa\u00efques Festival of World Culture.\nCin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re enjoys a well-earned\nreputation as one of the best places\nin London to see French film. Thanks\nto this reputation, it is able to attract\nsome of France\u2019s top acting and directing talent for on-stage debates and\nmasterclasses; recent guests include\nClaire Denis, Christophe Honor\u00e9, Romain Duris, Sophie Marceau, Mathieu\nAmalric, Fanny Ardant and Jean-Pierre\nBacri. It is also the cinema of choice\nfor UK distributors previewing new\nFrench releases: The Beat That My\nHeart Skipped, Couscous, The Diving\nBell and the Butterfly, La vie en rose,\nFemale Agents and more have all previewed at Cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re in recent years.\nThe cinema screens all the best new\nFrench releases, but is also known\nfor its carefully curated seasons of\nclassic French cinema on particular\nthemes (Paris at the Movies, French\navant-garde cinema of the 20s and\n30s, French cinema under the Occupation) or devoted to particular actors\nor directors (Truffaut, Godard, Claire\nDenis, Jacques Demy). Cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re\nalso champions the work of directors\nsuch as Marguerite Duras and Alain\nRobbe-Grillet whose films are rarely\nshown on London screens, and regularly organises special screenings of\nnew French films without UK distribution deals.\nThough its programming naturally\nreflects a French and francophone\nbias, Cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re also supports European and World cinema, and is part of\nthe Europa Cinemas Network. It works\nwith a variety of outside partners, especially other European cultural institutes in London, on seasons celebrating other national cinemas (Armenian,\nGerman, Romanian), or retrospectives\nof non-French actors and directors\nsuch as Pier-Paolo Pasolini, Werner\nHerzog, and Marcello Mastroianni. In\nrecent years the cinema has welcomed\nsuch distinguished guests as Francesco\nRosi, Abbas Kiarostami, Julian Schnabel, Alexi Gherman, Otar Iosseliani\nand Pedro Costa; its spring Mosa\u00efques\nFestival of World Culture and the\nLondon Spanish Film Festival in September have become popular annual\nevents and are especially significant\nin that they give screen space to films\nwhich would not otherwise be shown\nin the UK.\nSo there you go, a fantastic cinema\nwith great films you may never have\nthe opportunity to see elsewhere in\nLondon and it\u2019s just on our doorstep!\nThere are many film festivals taking\nplace soon including the French Film\nFestival and the European Documentary Festival which are featured in this\nweek issues.

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 13 NOVEMBER 2009\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEven higher fees? It\u2019s not for us, thanks\nThe government launched a review of\nhigher education funding for students\non Monday that, according to NUS\nwarnings, could lead to soaring tuition\nfees. The review will be chaired by Lord\nBrowne, former CEO of BP and the\ncurrent president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and is expected\nto report back next year. Lord Browne\nmade the headlines following his resignation in 2007, after revelations that\nhe may have used BP resources on his\nboyfriend, whom he reportedly met on\nthe escort website Suited and Booted.\nHe is said to be a close friend of Peter\nMandelson.\nThe Conservatives have been talking about lower state contributions\ntowards the cost of university degrees\nfor months as one of many proposed\nmeasures to tackle the record budget\ndeficit. Shadow Secretary of State for\nInnovation, Universities and Skills,\nDavid Willets, has recently called for\nthe cap on undergraduate student tuition fees, currently set at \u00a33225, to be\nraised to \u00a37000. The Rector of Imperial College, Sir Roy Anderson, has\nalso called for the caps to be \u2018relaxed\u2019\nin order to keep top universities globally competitive. Sir Roy is himself rumoured to be in line for a conservative\nSina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian News Editor peerage and job as an education minister in the next government. The review\nnow enjoys bipartisan support meaning that its recommendations will have\na significant impact regardless of who\nwins the next general elections.\nIronically the review was initially\npromised in 2004 in order to appease\nrebel Labour MPs who were threatening to vote against the bill to introduce\na \u00a33000 annual tuition fee. They were\nunder the impression that it could recommend scrapping the fee, yet now\nit looks almost certain that it will argue for higher fees and for loans to be\ncharged at commercial rates. As part of\nthat promise, the review had to begin\nthis year, but the fact that it will not report until after the elections has led to\naccusations that both parties are trying\nto avoid this becoming an issue at the\nCollege Hardship Fund 2009\nMoney worries affecting your studies?\nEU and Overseas students may be eligible for a grant from the\nCollege Hardship Fund (home students can apply to the\nAccess to Learning Fund.)\nWe understand that despite careful planning some students may face\nhigher than expected costs or a financial emergency. In such\ncases we may be able to assist with a small award from the\nCollege Hardship Fund which could provide the additional\nsupport you need to continue with your studies.\nAutumn term application deadline: 20 November 2009\nFURTHER INFORMATION AND APPLICATION FORMS:\nWeb: http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/registry/studentfinancialsupport/hardshipfund\nEmail: student.funding@imperial.ac.uk\nTelephone: 020 7594 8122\nUnion President\nAshley Brown\nhas signed letter\nof support\nconceived by\nthe NUS which\nlobbies against\nany rise in higher\neducation tuiton\nfees\ngeneral elections in May.\nAlthough the recommendations look\nvery likely to include higher costs for\nstudents, and to be implemented at all,\nthey will not affect anyone currently at\nuniversity or due to start next year. The\nreview has been asked to consider how\nmuch students will be charged and to\nlook at ways of increasing the numbers\nof students from poorer backgrounds\nat university, as well as simplifying the\nfunding system. It is feared that if students cannot afford to enter higher ed-ucation, it will lead to fewer graduates,\nreducing the competition for graduate\njobs and increasing salary costs for\nemployers. This means that the most\nvocal opponents of the proposals, student groups, could also be their greatest beneficiaries. To address this issue,\nthe review will also consider getting\nemployers to pay part of the cost of\nhigher education.\nOn Wednesday 11th November,\nthe NUS published a statement to the\npress, signed by ICU President Ashley\nBrown, calling for \u201cLabour and Conservative MPs to come clean on their\nstance\u201d over higher education fees,\nwhile suggesting that current policy\naims to \u201cduck difficult questions on\nstudent fees and finance at the next\ngeneral election\u201d, thus implying that\ntheir silence aims to avoid alienating\nthe student vote by voicing their true\nopinions. The letter goes on to discuss\nthat review panels are likely to be biased against students as it is \u201cdominated by business and university leaders\u201d.\nSpeaking about the decision to position ICU alongside the NUS on this is-sue, Ashley Brown said: \u201cI was asked to\nsign a letter from all students\u2019 unions\nin the country, which was published\nin the Guardian [on 11th November].\nThe letter calls for MPs to sign up to a\npledge that they will vote against an\nincrease in fees and for a fairer funding system. Although we disagree\nwith the National Union of Students\non a number of funding issues, their\nletter agrees with our current policy,\nso I was happy to sign it.\u201d\nCurrent ICU policy on Higher Education Funding was passed by Union\nCouncil on 18th February 2008 and\ncan be found on the Union website.\nEx- BP CEO Lord Browne will head the review of higher education\n\n"

This place\nbeing Imperial. Over the\nfew weeks of term this off-pissing has been building\nup, & it\u2019s time to get it off my Chest.\nHere is a brief summary of what I\u2019m\nmoaning about. So I\u2019m a Chemist, just\nentered my second year. I live relatively close to college, in Fulham, a half-hour walk away. My general day will\ngo as follows; 9.00 till 11.00 lectures:\nsome dull lecturer teaching some dull\ntopic. Fair enough, I understand that\nwe have to cover the basics to be able\nto move onto the interesting stuff, but\nit feels like they are actively trying to\nmake them as boring as possible.\nThen comes lab, 11.00 till 5.00. Either a computer lab, where you spend\nweeks in a dark basement computer\nroom playing with an annoying piece\nof software just for the sake of it, or\nproper lab \u2013 that in my opinion isn\u2019t\ntoo bad, it\u2019s actually what I want to be\ndoing, as a Chemist.\nAhh, just had a nice productive-ish\nday, maybe if you\u2019re lucky, and didn\u2019t\nloose all your product to a rotary evap-orator. Time to go home, and rela - \u2018O\nshit, we have another lecture. Dam!\u2019\nSeriously, who thought that 5.00 till\n6.00 lecture would be a good idea?\nLooking around the theater, it reminds\nme of nap time at primary school, just\nwith more facial hair (Yes, chemistry\nare a hairy bunch, and that\u2019s worrying\nwhen we have one of the highest male :\nfemale ratios on campus).\nThen I\u2019ll go home, do some food\nshopping, cook, eat, and before I know\nit\u2019 it\u2019s 8pm. That leaves about two\nhours before I have to go to bed be have\neven the slimmest chance of getting up\nin the morning. Yes, I admit it, I go to\nbed at 10.00. So, I struggle through the\nproblem sheets, lab reports, thinking I\nreally couldn\u2019t care less how the reduci-ble representations can be expressed as\nthe sum of irreducible representations\n(Don\u2019t ask\u2026).\nWhat about the hour-per-lecture at\nleast we are told to spend looking over\nour notes. If I did it on the night we\nhad had the lecture, obviously the best\ntime to do it, since it\u2019s fresh in your\nhead, I\u2019d be lucky to go to bed at 1am,\nthen miss the lecture\u2019s next morning be\noversleeping \u2013 something I have done\nfar to often. How about at the week-ends? Nope, afraid not, there\u2019s lab reports to be done.\nThey tell us this problem has been\naddressed, and this year, reading\nweeks have been introduced, to give us\nthat all-important time to review the\ncourse\u2019s. This week in fact. Brilliant,\nyou would think. Just what we need!\nUntil they go and set all the deadlines\nfor this terms major pieces of coursework right at the end of the week. Before you know it, it\u2019s Friday, and you\u2019ve\nonly just figured out what an irreducible representation is, handed in another mediocre piece of work, and no\nreview done.\nYou keep telling yourself that it\u2019ll be\nOK, and you\u2019ll be able to pull it together come exam. I\u2019ve been telling myself\nthat since the end of term 1 year 1,\nand nothing has so far changed. I feel\nlike I am constantly swimming against\nstrong currants, never managing to get\nahead, and barely keeping afloat.\nMaybe when I decided to come here,\nI should have known I\u2019d have no social\nlife, no free time, no between-term\nholidays & no fun for the next four\nyears, but I don\u2019t remember seeing that\nin the prospectus anywhere. Maybe I\nam being na\u00efve, and I\u2019m sure a lot of\nyou are telling me to man-up, but I\nknow that I am not alone in my year.\nMaybe again, it\u2019s just chemistry that\nunfortunately got it wrong, but I think\nnot. In the 2010 Times Good University Guide, Imperial ranks 3rd overall,\nbehind Oxbridge, but a sorry 58th in\nterms of Student satisfaction.\nAnyway, rant over. Ahh, feeling better already. Now onto proper politics.\nThis week has, of course, involved\nfar more important issues than me\nfailing my degree. Sunday was Rememberance Sunday, Tuesday was 20\nyears since the fall of the Berlin Wall &\nWednesday was Armistice Day.\nThis week, we have seen World\nLeaders put aside political differences\n& past disagreemnts, to honour those\nwho have died defending freedom. I\nam talking about the countless millions who have died in the numerous\nWars that have been fough in the name\nof freedom. And Wars are still being\nfought. There are currently 4100 UK\ntroops in Iraq, & 7800 in Afganistan.\nIt matters not whether you think the\nGovernment was morally or legally\nright or wrong to patricipate in these\nWars, all that matters this week is\nour unwavering public support of our\ntroops in the difficult & dangerous job\nthey are doing.\nThe leaders of the UK, France, Germany & Russia stood side-by-side,\nwith the US president on video-link,\nMonday, at the Brandenburg Gate, the\nsite that has come to symbolise the fall\nof the Wall. The 96 mile long Wall\nwas to seperate the enclave of Capitalist West Berlin from Communist East\nGermany, to stop East Germans fleeing to a better life of democracy. The\nrazing of this wall has come to symbolise the fight of the people over a\ntyrannous regime. The ceremony on\nMonday included a toppling of 1000\nmassive dominoes, along the course of\nthe wall, followed by fireworks, and for\nsome reason, a Bon Jovi concert.\nSo I\u2019m sitting here trying to think of\nsome poigniant closing remarks, but I\ncan\u2019t, & I\u2019m tired & hungry, so farewell,\nand have a good week.\nThink this is total crap? Why not try\nto do better? Email us at\npolitics.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPhil Murray\nPhil Murray Politics Editor\nYemeni Rebels cross northern border to Saudi Arabia, and kill officer, prompting a military responce from the Airforce\nYemeni Rebels Bombed\nThe growing conflict inside the Arab\npeninsula\u2019s oldest multi-party democracy has not exactly taken over world\nheadlines, even though fighting has\nbeen going on between the central\ngovernment and rebel fighters for the\npast five years.\nWith attention to the Middle-East\ndevoted almost entirely to negotiations in between Israelis and Palestinians, and the threat of a nuclear Iran,\nit has been all too easy to completely\nignore less flashy, though by no means\ninsignificant altercations occurring in\nthe Gulf.\nOn November 4th, Yemeni rebels\ncrossed the country\u2019s northern border\ninto Saudi Arabia, killed a Saudi officer\nand claimed to have taken a strategic\nmountaintop within the kingdom. The\nvery next day, Saudi aircraft reportedly bombed strategic rebel positions\nwithin Yemen, sparking anger and giving credence to rebel claims that Saudi\nArabia has been meddling in Yemeni\naffairs. The Saudi government directly\ndisputed all accusations, claiming its\nair force had only been deployed on\nrebel strongholds within its own bor-ders. What interest could a prosperous\nSaudi state have in getting so deeply\ninvolved in the sensitive affairs of its\nclose, markedly less wealthy and powerful neighbour?\nDespite taking power in 1978, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah al-Saleh\u2019s\ngovernment has never exerted much\ncontrol outside the country\u2019s main cit-ies; rough mountainous terrain that,\nas in Afghanistan, is notoriously difficult to police. That he has managed\nto stay in power so long owes more\nto his skill in manipulating, co-opting\nand coercing rival factions and tribes\nthan the existence of any form of widespread popular support. However,\nwith his government mired in corruption and revenues from oil dwindling\nfast, he has found it increasingly difficult to satisfy demands in this fragile\njuggling act. Perceived coziness with\nSunni-dominated Saudi Arabia has\nnot helped feelings within the minority\nShia community, who view their radically conservative northern neighbor\nas a pernicious cultural influence.\nThe clashes of the last five years pit\ngovernment forces against fighters\nloyal to the Houthi family, a powerful\nnorthern clan. They style themselves\nas mujahideen, in the manner of the\nguerrilla fighters who chased the Russians out of Afghanistan. Although\ntheir chants and slogans suggest links\nto more dangerous global jihadist\ngroups, most of their adherents belong\nto the Zaydi sect, a markedly quietist\nsect that is unique to Yemen. Confusingly enough, Zaydis, who represent\na third of Yemen\u2019s population, are in\ngeneral markedly well represented in\nthe Yemeni government; President\nAli Abdullah al-Saleh is himself Zaydi.\nBut his perceived ineptitude as a ruler,\nhis neglect of northern regions of the\ncountry, and, perhaps more profound-ly, long-held resentments over the way\nhe came to power (he overthrew the\nclerical rule of a Zaydi monarch) have\nbred and produced a radical Zaydi\ngroup staunchly in opposition to the\ncentral government; the Houthis.\nAlthough the Houthis are less well\nequipped than government forces,\nthe army\u2019s ferocious yet unskilful approach to dealing with the guerilla\nfighters (bombing and open artillery\nfire) has resulted in significant civilian\ncasualties, with the counter-produc-tive effect of turning local sympathy in\nfavour of the rebels. Guerrilla fighters\nhave quietly gained control of a few\nstrategic roads and positions, and a\ngeneral increase in lawlessness across\nthe country has begun to cause serious\nconcerns among international observers on the ability of the government\nto run the country. Saudi Arabia is\nespecially concerned that a failure in\nYemen to contain Shia rebellion could\nspill across the border and undermine\nits own hitherto successful efforts in\nquashing similar dissent.\nMost significant perhaps is the suggestion of regional power-games.\nHouthi rebels accuse the government\nof truckling to Sunni Saudi Arabia,\nwhile the government maintains that\nShia-controlled Iran has quietly been\nsupporting rebel efforts. The possibility of a proxy struggle between Shia\nand Sunni interests in the Arab world\nwould heighten stakes considerably,\nwith serious potential implications\nfor the rest of the world. Saudi newspapers have described the problem as\na \u201cmushrooming cancer\u201d; something\nthat the entire surrounding community\nof Yemenis, Saudis, and even Omanis\nmust deal with collectively. However,\nwithout a strong central government\nin Sana\u2019a, chances for this happening\nremain slim.\nAnthony Maina\nAnthony Maina\n\n"

The party was held in collaboration with Kings College Erasmus\nclub, who managed to send almost 7\nmembers.\nLured by the promise of free cans\nof \u2018Foster\u2019 and the presence of fanny\nT\nhe Imperial College Debating Society has been\nhard at work over the\nsummer to organise the\nthird annual Glencore Imperial College Intervarsity Debating\nCompetition.\nOne of the real highlights of debating is that you have the opportunity\nto go to championships all across the\ncountry and to meet students from\nother universities who are also interested in current affairs. I was new to\ndebating when I joined the club last\nyear but I was able to enter competitions at Kings, LSE and the University\nof Nottingham. Our society has sent a\nteam to the World championships in\n2008 and the European championships\nearlier this year.\nBut playing a role in organising a\ncompetition was very different from\njust taking part in one! There was a\nhuge amount of work to be done... convenor Dominic was hard at work over\nthe summer making room bookings,\ncontacting our sponsors Glencore for\nfunding and finding a team of judges\nfor the competition. Meanwhile, social\nsecretary Enrico was hard at work organising a (epic!) social event for the\ndebaters. Other members of the committee spent a large amount of time\npromoting the event to other societies \u2013 for example by designing promotional material and setting up our\nFacebook group.\nAs the new term began and attentions briefly shifted to Freshers Fair,\neverything finally came together and\nthe big day was here - the Imperial IV\nhad started as an idea: now it was a\ncompetition.\nDebates were conducted in British\nParliamentary style with four preliminary rounds and a break into the fi-nals. The overall best speaker for this\ntournament was Mr Max Kasriel from\nCambridge University out of 88 speak-ers. The winning team was Cambridge\nA with Mr Sam Block and Mr Harish Natarajan. The teams debated five\ntopics:\n1. This house would force all sitting\nrepresentatives who leave their party\nto immediately stand for re-election.\n2. This house would abolish all libel\nand slander laws.\n3. This house would break the law to\nprotect animal rights.\n4. This house would ban all\npornography.\n5. This house believes that the religious organisations that suicide bombers belong to should be punished.\nAfter the extremely close finals of\nthe competition (judging took well\nover an hour!) a social event was held\nwhere much food was consumed and\ndrink was drunk. The Imperial IV\nwas one of the first debating events of\nthe academic year and also one of the\nhighlights.\nThe Imperial College Debating Society has organised public debates on\nmany high profile current issues. We\nexist to promote informed, intelligent\ndebate in all aspects of human enquiry.\nWe organise show debates and provide\nprofessional coaching by national debaters to members of our society. The\nnext show debate is on Thursday 19th\nNovember and we will be discussing\nenvironmental policy.\nIf you would like to find out more\nabout debating, please come to one of\nour weekly meetings on Wednesday\nevening 6pm-8pm in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building room 120. You\ncan also visit our website at http://\nunion.ic.ac.uk/scc/debating or email\ndebate@imperial.ac.uk.\nSo how does university debating\nwork? British parliamentary style is the\nmost common style of debating at university level.\nThe debate consists of four teams\nwith two different sides, the proposition and the opposition.

Thanks to\nsome excellent defending by Romain\nHenry and Ivan Prnja, Imperial extended their lead and looked to be in\nfor a good result in their Development\nLeague debut. Unfortunately, the team\nwas unable to make their counter attacks count and with Warwick\u2019s strong\nhalf-wing slowly warming up, firing\na few shots past Imperials seemingly\nhelpless goalkeeper the half time score\nwas not in our favour.\nAfter an elaborate analysis of the repetitive attacking pattern displayed by\nWarwick, we managed to come back\nstrong after half time. Our top scorer\nKolja Ortmann added a few to his tally\nand with Ruben Freytag man marking\nthe only player that posed a threat to\nStefan Bauer\u2019s goal, the Eagles were in\nfor the fight.\nHowever, with only one substitute\navailable in a game that allows unlimited substitutions, it was always going\nto be the last minutes, that will decide\non who is going home with the 2 points\non the league table.\nStill being 4 goals down with only a\nfew minutes to go, the Imperial Eagles\nhad to go all-or-nothing in defence to\nforce quick turnovers and hope to be\nmore clinical with their counter at-tacks, but luck was not on our side.\nDespite the very encouraging performances by David M\u00fcller-Wiesner\nand Michael Capper in their first ever\nHandball game, Warwick broke our\ndefence on a few occasions thereby securing their victory.\nIn spite of the result, the team can\nbe very pleased with their overall performance after merely 3 training sessions in the term so far. Plenty of team\nspirit has been displayed and some impressive attacking combinations have\nbeen shown and I will look forward to\nreporting the teams\u2019 first victory of the\nseason in the near future.\nTennis coast to\nSuccess\nHandball in need of improvement\nContinued from back page\nContinued from Back Page\nRodger Federer winds up for another ACE\n\n"

Oh dear\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI finally met someone who I enjoyed\nbeing on a date with and the evening\nwent really well. We spent the night\ntogether at his. In the morning he\nhad to get up for work and left before\nI woke up. I had breakfast and then\nwent to the loo. Of course I had to\ndo a number 2 and much to my horror couldn\u2019t get rid of it. I flushed\nand flushed. Eventually I resorted to\nputting it into a carrier bag to take\nwith me and then dispose of. I left\na note on the work top to say how\nmuch I had enjoyed the night before\nand was looking forward to seeing\nhim again and hurried out of the\ndoor.\nAs soon I had shut the front door, I\nhad a pretty upsetting realisation:\nI\u2019d left the carrier bag by the note\non the work top. I now have only 3\nhours until he\u2019ll get back. HELP!\nCarrie Gab\nDear Carrie,\nOk, you need to act swiftly. Call him\nand say that you forgot something at his\nhouse and that you need it desperately.\nThen wait outside the door until he gets\nback. As soon as he does, run upstairs,\ngrab the bag and discreetly stuff it in\nyour pocket. Then rapidly make haste\nfor the door and try to pass it off as normally as possible. Hopefully the smell\nwon\u2019t be too bad. Good luck.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nOne of my best friends has a really\nembarrassing habit. Whenever he is\npondering something, he scratches\nhis balls, which makes a flappy wet\nsound and then he sniffs his fingers.\nI am pretty sure he has noticed my\nhorrified expression but doesn\u2019t\nseem to stop him.\nPlease help me out as I have no idea\nwhat I should do?\nTess Tickles\nDear Tess,\nThis does seem to be quite coddy con-dendrum and which may take some\nfishing for a solution. I believe that he\nmight be sniffing his own smeg, otherwise known as willy cheese. Some\npeople might associate this smell with\nsuccess and it can relieve stress. How\nabout sniffing his fingers, maybe it just\nsmells really good. You could give him\nan exaggerated look of disgust or just\nsocially shun him for a while. It might\nbe nicer to just bring up the next time\nIt\u2019s an entirely normal solution to a massive turd and a weak-pressured toilet. Pick it up and put it in a bag. You\u2019re not a fucking dog, love! Maybe you are......\nhe does it but be sure to remain at arms\nlength.\nAunty Mcpickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nLast week me and my girlfriend were\nenjoying a cosmical sexual session\nand reached for some lubrication.\nThe room was dark and two tubes\nlay at our disposal. One was the\ndesired KY jelly and the other was\nsome super glue, left over from my\nmodel plane making kit.\nWe were soon stuck in a very sticky\nsituation which involved a humiliating trip to A&E and some very\nintimate doctor hands. I know have\nsome of her parts left on me and me\non her. Can it ever be the same?\nLouis Ligase\nDear Louis,\nThis is as cliche as it comes, Louis! I\nwould have loved to seen the sight of\nyou two waddling down Fulham Road\nto Chelsea & Westminister A&E. It\nwould be an idea to keep super glue\naway from bedroom area, especially\nwhen embarking on the love journey.\nAunty McPickle xxx\nQ: What are the two things Imperial students love most?\nA: Free alcohol and dressing up like\ntwats!

    "content": "29\nfelix FRIDAY 13 NOVEMBER 2009\nclubs&socs.felix@imperial.ac.uk C & S\nfelix\nF\nollowing in a long tradition\nof ambitious summer tours,\nthe Fellwanderers bravely\nset off to Poland and Slovakia. We were soon on our\nway to Zakopane, the gateway to the\nTatra mountain range. As we all know,\nnothing can be accomplished without\nfull stomachs so the group\u2019s first major\neffort was to find some typical Polish\ncuisine. With this mission accomplished we returned to the hostel to try\nand share out group kit. Despite our\nbest attempts at fairness Ande persistently protested about his inability to\ntake too much kit lest it not tessellate\nperfectly in his rucksack...\n6:45am the next morning felt very\npainful. However, the free breakfast\ncertainly went some way to livening\nthings up and a short bus ride later\nwe were well and truly in the Tatras at\nJavorina (~1000m) and taking our first\nsteps into the mountains.\nContinuing upwards we were rewarded by alpine meadows and the\nstunning views we would become accustomed to, though by the first pass\nthe costs of not properly breaking my\nboots in were already becoming ap-parent. By lunchtime we had reached\nour first hut and most of the group decided to bag our first peak, Jahnaci stit,\n2230m. We got within perhaps 100m\n(vertically) of the summit before peals\nof thunder started echoing round the\nmountains and after a hasty photo we\nbeat a swift retreat. However, as thunderstorms move a good deal faster\nthan people the retreat was not swift\nenough and we had the hair-raising experience of crossing a snowfield whilst\nlightening flashed around us. With our\nfirst hearty drenching under our belts,\nthe Spicy Sausage Pasta was fed to very\napproving masses.\nDay 3 was the day where the epic\nfail mentality of the trip truly came\ninto being. Starting with an annoying\nalarm setting error depriving us of an\nextra half hour of sleep it was also the\nday of the legendary vodka fail. The\nwalk itself was uneventful, highpoint\n2038m, impressive thunderstorms in\nthe Tatra basin and a bypass of the imposing Lomnicky stit which stands at\n2634m. From the hut, the \u201cmetropolis\u201d\nof Stary Smokovec was a mere hour\nand a half\u2019s walk away. Some took this\nopportunity to gorge on icecream and\nbuy essentials such as Tang and Vodka.\nJoe was guardian of the vodka and after lovingly carrying it all the way back\nup the hill and cooling it mountain\nspring disaster struck! Those back at\nthe hut were peacefully playing cards\nwhen they heard a smash and a suspiciously familiar smell... After carrying\nthe bottle for over 2 hours Joe dropped\nand smashed it on the steps of the hut.\nMorale sunk lower after the vegetarian\nnature of the following week became\napparent and we had to watch the dog\nlapping up our vodka!\nDay 4\u2019s walk was where the challenges of the terrain became apparent. Our\nroute was still impassable due to snow\nand instead we had a change of plan\nto conquer a 2376m snow-covered\ndelight before beating the rain and descending to intermediate hut Teryho\nChata for lunch. With strict sausage\noriented instructions yet another party\nmade an afternoon trip to Stary Smokovec returning with a giant sausage to\nappease the carnivores.\nDay 5 was my worst of the fortnight,\ninstead of \u201ccontouring\u201d as promised\nit soon emerged that the Slovakians\nprefer paths which are a sequence of\nimpossibly uncomfortable ups and\ndowns. By the time we stopped for\nlunch at Sliezsky dom, Chris had to\nperform minor foot surgery to allow me to continue. We continued in\nblistering heat and as if Chris\u2019s first\naid skills had still not been adequately\nproved Nathaniel, Jim, Ande and Joe\ndecided to take a cooling dip in a lake,\neach emerging covered in various cuts\nand bruises. To add insult to (at this\npoint considerable) injury, the high\npoint of the day, whilst only at a mere\n1966m, was round a corner the likes\nof which I hope never to see again. Its\nnever-ending nature baffles me even\nnow; geometry just didn\u2019t seem to\nwork with this beast. I very nearly shed\na few tears of gratitude when the pole\nof the summit appeared.\nCombined with the threat of impending rain we started descending\nthe sheer 500m slope to our next ho-tel/hut. After never ending zig-zags we\nwere down almost without mishap.\nOn Day 6 the group split into 3. Rafal\nand I saw an impressive thunderstorm,\nwhilst having a restful shopping day,\nChris and Yvonne bagged the mighty\nRysy (2499m) and the others did a\nlong circular walk with Eva (high-point 2314m). After all of this activ-ity, the seventh day was (nominally)\na day of rest. In Fellwanderers terms\nthis turned out to mean either a conquering of Koprovsky stit at 2363m or\na trip to Poprad. In Poprad we experienced culinary delights such as vampire quelling garlic soup and in Joe and\nNathaniel\u2019s case \u2013 raw sausage!\nDay 8 was Rysy day. Chris and\nYvonne went back to England, leaving\nonly 7 of us behind. Though Chris and\nYvonne had already conquered Rysy,\nthey hadn\u2019t done it hauling up their\npacks with them, as we were about to\nattempt. We were walking by 7 hoping\nto beat any bad weather. Despite calf-strain issues we made good time up the\n1100m ascent to the summit, though\ndecreasing visibility and increasing\ndoubts about the weather for the most\ntechnically demanding descent of the\ntour were concerning.\nAs we started the 1000 vertical metre descent the rain commenced and\nvisibility dropped to ~5m. The chains\nwere more or less constant for 500m\nof the descent across rock faces with\nstreams of water providing the lubrication none of us needed to make\na quicker descent than desirable. By\nthe time we reached the path section\nwe were brutally tired and hungry but\nvowed not to eat until we reached the\nlake just a short distance from our next\nhut. The exhaustion took its toll and\nRafal dramatically slipped and gashed\nhis forehead open. We realised at this\npoint that Nathaniel\u2019s first aid certificate may need renewal when he stuck\nthe plaster over Rafal\u2019s left eye...\nAs a mark of how exhausting the\nday was, we were in bed by 8:30 after\nmerely boiling some water, putting it\nwith some couscous and stirring some\nrandom ingredients into the mixture:\ntrekking cooking at its best.\nAfter Rysy the next day was merely\na walk into Zakopane (Zak-the-Pony,\nif you\u2019re asking Jim) and despite aching muscles and wounded feet we still\nsummoned the energy to walk to an\nout of town restaurant, recommended\nby Rafal\u2019s friends to celebrate our survival so far and some excellent exam\nresults! The food was amazing and was\nfollowed by a night of wild celebration,\nperhaps a little too wild for some as it\nconcluded with Nathaniel throwing up\nout of the hostel\u2019s window...\nThe next day a hung-over Nathaniel\nsheepishly went outside with a mop\nwhilst most of us conquered Koscielec,\nwhich Rafal found an inexplicably\nfrightening experience. Ande managed\nto scare him whilst just sitting still on\nthe top whilst moving his arms around\nexcitedly. Tired of authentic Polish\nfood we defected to an Italian for din-ner, eagerly anticipating our next day\nof trekking. However, the next day the\nweather was bad and we all woke up\nfeeling fractious. After getting to the\nhut most of us just sat around playing\nbridge, though Jim and Joe somehow\nsummoned the energy for another\nwalk, getting a cable car ride in the\nbargain.\nWe battled through Wales-esque\nweather for the day, climbing a ridge\nso windy we considered turning back.\nWhilst walking along the top we suddenly discovered we\u2019d lost Ande, a matter of concern considering the steep\ncliffs and strong winds. Eventually he\nwas found, but we were relieved when\nthe clouds cleared at last for beautiful\nlunchtime views.\nAt the next hut Jim had his epic fail:\nhe locked himself, and the key to our\nroom, in the shower. Rafal came to the\nrescue eventually after dark mutterings\nabout stupid undergrads (in the previous hut we blocked their only sink during doing the washing up).\nDay 13 was our last proper trekking\nday and by now, I for one was feeling\ntruly exhausted. However, clearly not\neveryone shared my sentiments as Jim,\nJoe and Gavin decided to do an afternoon walk and managed the 4h15 walk\nin under 2 hours!\nThe last walk of the trip was, in my\nopinion, also one of the best. After a\nslog up through a forest we emerged\nonto a giant horseshoe ridge encompassing 7 major peaks and affording\nmagnificent views of all the different\nparts of the Tatras. Even the weather\nspared us the customary afternoon\nthunderstorm, it really was a perfect\nend to the trip. Which, and I\u2019m sorry\nto say this, is more than can be said for\nthe attempts at food on the last night...\nWe had sort of accidently run out of\ncarbs, which resulted in Jim, Ande, Joe\nand Gavin being convinced that with\nonion, garlic salt, milk powder, gouda,\nsausage, porridge, sugar, herbs and\nspices and a pack of bourbon biscuits\nthey could make something edible. We\nwere all doubtful, especially Rafal who\nresorted to hut food even before their\nattempt.\nI have to say that especially considering their ingredients the main\ncourse at least was a great success,\noat balls with a creamy sausage sauce\nand a cheese side were truly excellent\nhowever \u201cdessert\u201d was where they fell\ndown a little. For any freshers reading\nthis; be warned you CANNOT make\ncheesecake with Gouda and attempts\nto do so are a crime against human-ity. The prevailing kitchen opinion appeared to be \u201cif we add enough sugar\nit will work\u201d. Error. The tang and powdered milk sauce as custard substitute\nwas particularly unwelcome. Never try\nthis at home.\nToo soon, tour was over! We returned to Krakow and after all Rafal\nhad put up with from us, we promised\nto meet him promptly at 6:45 to go\nto his favourite restaurant in Krakow.\nDespite the challenges this posed to a\ngroup of people with no clean clothes\nwe so very nearly accomplished this\nmission but for our small, reoccurring\nproblem on this trip: OCD, tessellation\nobsessive Ande somehow managed to\nseparate himself from the group... After waiting for 5 mins on a street corner we decided he must have missed\nus and gone ahead. We met Rafal on\ntime but had to confess that even in\nthis, us undergrads had disappointed\nhim. Eventually reunited we ordered\n\u201cThe Trough\u201d, a giant shared platter of\nmeat, dumpling and all other amazing\nPolish food. After a quick drink we all\nrolled back to the hostel except Jim and\nJoe who went off for a night out in the\ntown, rolling in around 5 having fallen\nprey to kebabs.\nAs I assume is customary, it came\nto light at this meal that many more\nfails had taken place than first imag-ined. In fact, it appeared that almost\neveryone had an interesting story to\ntell about getting to Krakow bus sta-tion, from Ande\u2019s wallet loss, to Chris\nand Yvonne sharing a carriage with a\nwoman throwing up into her handbag,\nto my personal favourite, Joe\u2019s rescuing all the carbs that he had previously\nthrown into an airport bin to save\nweight in his luggage.\nOf course, with this group there were\nso many hilarious fails it\u2019s impossible\nto recount them all here. So, I shall\nleave you with just a few more of the\nbest:\n1. Joe knocking over a full pint of\nbeer, trying to grab the last few drops\nof a shot of rum\n2. Nathaniel \u201cwhat are these?\u201d I know\nI\u2019ll eat a teaspoon full of them, them\nbeing chilli flakes\nAnde adding salt to his sweet pancakes instead of sugar before anyone\ncould warn him off, he maintained it\nstill tasted good but I\u2019m fairly sure he\nlied\n3. Jim\u2019s failed attempt at dealing\ncards: he was so tired he managed to\ndeal himself and Joe twice the number\nanyone else got.\nFinally, I think everyone who attended would like to wholeheartedly thank\nEva, Rafal and Nathaniel for making\nthis trip happen; it really was amazing and has definitely set the standards\nof both organisational excellence and\nundergraduate stupidity for coming\nyears.\nThe Fellwanderers\u2019 Summer Tour to Slovakia and Poland\nHeather Jones on walks in Eastern Europe with weather extremes, odd alcohols and Polish bear-riders.\nThe Polish army\u2019s secret weapon\n\n"

The arts appears somewhere\nbetween these two extremes. I used\nto hate going to musicals on my own-who can you chat to about the fit-ass\nleading man and the catchy tunes?\nSo this week I tried out solo culture\nby taking in Little Fish (review on the\npage opposite). It was a spur of the\nmoment thing. I\u2019d received an offer\nof reduced price tickets through the\nFinborough\u2019s facebook group, and so,\nafter a fruitless day in lab, decided to\ntreat myself. Luckily I\u2019ve been there\nbefore so I didn\u2019t have the embarrassment of not knowing where anything is\nand looking like a lost child (in my case\nliterally, I look about twelve). Once\nI got into the theatre I began to reap\nthe rewards of being on my own. For a\nstart, there\u2019s no having to hold the other person\u2019s coat as they grab a drink. I\nactually enjoyed not having anyone to\nremark to because: a) I could concentrate on the show without feeling that I\nhad to check they were happy and, b) I\ndidn\u2019t have them complaining at me for\nconstantly analysing everything from\nthe plot to the lighting. I don\u2019t think\nthis works for every show - I could\nnever imagine going to the Rocky\nHorror Show on my own or anything\nthat makes me look like a middle-aged\nmatinee lady. My flatmate loves to attend arts events on her own, she thinks\nit makes her feel cultured. I think I\u2019ve\nfinally realised what she means.\nThis week we\u2019ve got a bit of everything to delight you. Caz Knight has\nbeen to see John Baldessari\u2019s new retrospective at the Tate Modern. My last\nmemory of the Tate Modern is buying\na ridiculously tiny and overpriced coffee but I guess we shouldn\u2019t go to art\ngalleries for the caffeine fix. Christopher Self has been waxing philosophical about I Am A Cat, a collection of\nJapanese tales and we start a new fea-ture: Science in Art and no, its not a\ntypo, this week\u2019s is by my sister but it\nwas just too awesome to not put in.\nScience as Art: Part 1\nWe take a look at art without leaving the comfort zone of science\nL\nevel four of the formidable Tate Modern is a hive\nof activity this autumn.\nVisitors swarm to the neon\nglow of its Pop Life exhibition following the controversy that\nphotographs of a naked, thirteen year\nold Brooke Shields had to be removed\non the grounds that they overstepped\nthe line of what is acceptable. Just op-posite, is the slightly less ostentatious\nentrance to Pure Beauty, a retrospective of the work of American artist,\nJohn Baldessari. This latest exhibition\ncoincides with the retrospective of Ed\nRuscha (reviewed here a few weeks\nago) almost next door at the Hayward\ngallery; another Californian of similar\nage.\nUpon entering Pure Beauty, it is clear\nwhy the parallels are drawn between\nthe two artists. During the seventies,\nBaldessari painted words onto canvases which bring to mind Ruscha\u2019s\nfascination with letters and word-play.\nWhile they might pale in comparison\nto Ruscha\u2019s bright, bold colours, Baldessari makes up for in humour. In one\nwork the artist has painted, in capitals,\nTips for Artists Who Want to Sell, instructing that paintings with bright\ncolours tend to sell better. This sense of\nhumour pervades all his work during\nthe seventies and eighties as Baldessari\nchallenges the way in which art has\nhitherto been created as well as trying to order and categorise the things\nin our world. In one example of this,\nBaldessari photographs all the cars\nparked in a street so that one sees only\nthe colour of the car door and mounts\nthe pictures in frames in the order they\nappear on the street to give the illusion\nof a paint chart.\nJohn Baldessari was one of the pioneers of conceptual art and, walking\nthrough this collection, it is clear to\nsee where other artists have been influenced by him. His photographic\nseries, The Artist Hitting Various Objects with a Golf Club, capturing him\ntrying to hit inanimate objects to the\ncentre of the photo is mounted as a series of twelve (three by four) and recall\nthe work of the much younger conceptual artist, the South African, Robin\nRhode.\nAnother instance where an artist has\nemulated Baldessari is Tracey Emin\u2019s\nburning of all her work in 1989 when\nshe decided to change her direction. In\n1970 Baldessari conducted the \u2018Cremation Project\u2019 of all his earlier works and\nthis act is commemorated in the exhibition by an urn shaped like a book.\nNot only did he kick start the notion\nof conceptual art \u2212where the process\nis just as, if not more, important than\nthe final product \u2212 but Baldessari also\nquestions common art practices. The\nnotion of aesthetics is put into question by a canvas upon which is painted\na statement declaring that we are powerless with respect to whether we like a\npainting or not: the aesthetic judgment\nis made in a split second outside of our\nconsciousness. In order to eliminate\nsubjectivity, Baldessari photographed\nhis hometown of National City, snapping away at random without ever\nlooking through the viewfinder. This\ncaptured the city as it was without any\ninfluence from the artist\u2019s aesthetic\njudgements.\nThis approach seems haphazard and\nunconventional when compared to\nwhat would have been standard practice at the time (Baldessari also got\nothers to paint some of his works such\nas Commissioned Painting: A Painting by Anita Storck) but it makes for\npieces which make one laugh out loud\nfrequently and sigh in wonder at his\ningenuity.\nThe next stage of Baldessari\u2019s career\nis filled with images taken from the society pages of newspapers, the faces of\nthe people obscured by coloured dots,\nmovie stills and collages. His later collages made up of a collection of appendages are often unsightly and make\none miss his witty earlier works. But,\nlike Ruscha, Baldessari returns back to\ncommon themes. The \u2018clouds\u2019 apparent in Cigar Smoke to Match Clouds\nThat Are the Same make a reappearance in Brain/Cloud artwork.\nA huge brain is fixed to the wall of\nthe last room and visitors become part\nof the art as they watch themselves\nprojected onto the opposite wall but\nwith a time delay, showing that while\nBaldessari may have grown older, his\nsense of humour is still well and truly\nhere.\nPure Beauty is at the Tate Modern until\n10th January, entry costs \u00a310 so treat\nyourself to an early Christmas present.\nConceptual Art? Must be Tate Modern\nCaz Knight challenges common art as she embraces the world of John Baldessari\u2019s retrospective Pure Beauty\nThose large coloured areas must be covering up some really ugly people\nMedics, you can tell everyone you\u2019re an artist! That\u2019s one way to get the girls\nT\nhis is from a series of\npaintings looking at the\nmicroscopic world inside\nour bodies. Blood clots are\nusually seen as something\na bit icky, but close up they\u2019re really\nquite pretty.\nThis picture makes me think of lots\nof squishy rubber rings all piled up,\nready to take a dive through the blood\nvessel. Or maybe some delicious raspberry doughnuts. Art is all about the\nusing your imagination, so what do you\nsee? Answers on the back of a postcard.\nThe harsh attack of the yellow string,\ninstead of destroying the painting,\nadds another dimension and makes us\nrealise how delicate our bodies are.\nI think this painting shows just how\nawesome the body really is; there are\nmillions of these floating around our\nbody and we don\u2019t even realise the\nbeauty of them. And red blood cells\nare just the beginning: the body is full\nof little systems like this each with their\nown beauty and wonder.\nThis week\u2019s Science in Art is Blood\nClot by Lisa Harrold, 2009, acrylic and\nstring on canvas. Made any amazing\nart w/science discoveries of your own?\nSend us a picture and description and\nwe\u2019ll show it.\n\n"

Colima was hit by 120 mm rain\nLandslides hit El\nSalvador Project\nTwo houses built by Imperial\u2019s El Salvador Reconstruction and Development Project in El Salvador\u2019s Colima\ncommunity has been hit by devastating landslides. Over a hundred people have been claimed dead and many\nmore are feared to have undergone the\nsame fate. Thousands of houses have\nbeen either fully or partially destroyed,\nincluding the two earthquake resistant\nhouses built by 11 Civil Engineering students this summer.\nThey worked with REDES, a charity organization committed to promising construction projects in an effort to\nrebuild the country after a sequence of\ndeadly natural disasters, most notably\nthe 2001 earthquakes.\nDomingo Alas, worker for the NGO\nREDES (Reconstruction and Development Organization of El Salvador) says:\n\u201cSo far 154 women, elderly and children have died because of floods. We are\nin much sadness and suffering. Thousands of families have lost their homes\nand belongings and are left with nothing,\nabsolutely nothing.\u201d\nRolando Morales, REDES\u2019s Director of\nPlanning, speaks of urban areas like Verapaz \u2018having been reduced to half their\nsize\u2019\n. \u201cThe scale of destruction caused\nwithout a doubt exceeded the devastation of tropical storm Stan and the Ilamatepec volcano eruption of 2005\u201d\n, Morales remarks.\nThe most affected areas in the country\nare the departments of San Salvador, San\nVicente, Cuscatl\u00e1n and La libertad.\nfelix has obtained initial figures from\nREDES about the aftermath of the disas-ter: 154 dead of whom 40% are believed\nto be children, 13,860 people displaced,\n209 homes completely destroyed, 1835\nhouses damaged and 18 crucial bridges\ncollapsed or displaced.\nThe board of Imperial\u2019s El Salvador\nProject urges in particular Civil Engineering students to try to get involved\nover the coming years to provide crucial\nassistance to the parts of the poor country that need it most.\nRazJabary\nRazJabary News Reporter\nInter-faculty mascotry\nkicks off this week\nThe time old tradition of mascotry at\nCollege has kicked off once again with\nthe RCSU and CGCU reporting the disappearances of their violate mascots.\nBolt, one of two CGCU mascots was\neasily violated by the RCSU at last week\u2019s\norganised Bonfire Barnight held in the\nUnion bar. However, CGCU have levelled\nthe score as they stole approximately a\nthird of RCSU\u2019s Theta with the equal ease\nthis week.\nLast Thursday saw the Union hold host\nto both the CGCU barnight and RCSU\ncomedy night; CGCU Kirsty Patterson\nadmitted mascotry was nigh on the night.\n\u201cI had expected one to go missing\nthis evening but had thought Spanner\nprotected by the Links Club.\u201d\nBoth of CGCU\u2019s mascots were on\ndisplay on the night, with the CGCU\ntie club, Links, protecting the 68lb Bolt\nand the Miss. Patterson herself protecting Spanner.\nHowever, little distraction was needed to violate Bolt on the night. Acting\nRCSU Vice President (Activities) Chris\nGibbs casually picked up Bolt from the\nstool it sat on in the middle of a circle\nof Links Club members. The first Engineer to raise the alarm was reportedly\nCGCU Vice President (Finance & Societies) Rikki Norris as Mr. Gibbs wandered out of the Union bar to quickly\nconceal the mascot into hiding. Its\nwhereabouts is currently unknown.\nSpanner and Bolt have only recently\nbeen returned to this year\u2019s committee\nlast month after they spent the entire\nsummer at an unknown location off\ncampus with anonymous captors. After\na long and hard struggle, Kirsty Patterson agreed to the return of the two mascots back to campus at the Freshers\u2019 Bar\nNight on the 15th October.\nThe RCSU\u2019s success in violating the\nCGCU mascot could not be savoured\nfor long however, as a section of Theta,\nRCSU\u2019s 7ft tall steel thermometer was\ntaken from its hiding place in the Felix office this week by CGCU\u2019s Trojan\nHorse Society.\nIt is the first time in recent years that\nthe RCSU has partaken in the annual\nrounds of mascotry, and have been cri-tised by rival Faculty Unions for their\nlack of activity. The design of Theta allows it to be taken into much smaller,\nconcealable parts, and into hiding. It was\nsaid to have been assembled completely\nfor the first time under the new RCSU\nexecutive committee this week, after\nA WINNER\nIS YOU!\nWe ran a competition two weeks ago giving away a month\u2019s supply of\nRelentless Energy Drink.

The current Felix\nEditor and Scientist was entrusted with\nthe piece by RCSU President Katya-yani\nVyas, but Engineers easily located the\nScientists\u2019 mascot in the obvious hiding\nplace that was the Felix office. The RCSU\nPresident is understandably livid.\nWith scores level and RAG Week ap-proaching, the tradition is to auction\nback the mascots to their rightful owners with agreed monies given to the\nRAG charity bucket.\nThe sport of mascotry has existed as long as anyone can really remember at College and\nis steeped in tradition and superstition. It involves the capture and return of each other\u2019s\nFaculty Union mascots. Tactical skill and sometimes brute force has been used to capture\nrival Faculty\u2019s mascots.\nMascots involved are \u201cviolate\u201d, meaning the steal of a rival mascot is technically permitted\nbut rarely desired. A stolen mascot is said to be\u201dviolated\u201d. The safe return of the mascot is\nensured if the ransom fee set by the capturing Faculty Union is met. The ransom money is\nthen donated to RAG charity(Raising and Giving).\nThe Royal College of Science Union\u2019s violate mascot is a 7ft steel thermometer, named Theta.\nTwo mascots, Spanner and Bolt fly the flag for the City & Guilds College Union. Neither are\ntraditional Faculty Unions, but both Royal School of Mines and RAG have their own violate\nmascots in the form of Davy (lamp) and Chris (large collecting bucket).\nThere are unwritten rules that accompany mascotry.

Not to be,\nas the hairdressers was closed. Not the\nbe defeated, and now feeling like a lion\nafter its prey I ventured to Gloucester\nRoad and strode into the first one I\nfound. Despite the fact that I have (he\nlooks like a girl- ed) flowing locks that\nany female would be proud of, access to\nthe premises was denied. Apparently\nthey only cut the hair of the fairer sex.\nBastards. I made sure I didn\u2019t make my\nmistake at my next stop, walked in and\nasked the woman if \u201cshe could lop all\nthis off?\u201d. Apparently she could, which\nwas good. Now, I may be acting a little\nharsh on the girl, but that was the brief.\nWhen asked if I wanted the clippers,\nor if she should taper it, what did she\nreally expect?

But instead of responding\nto this new found acclaim like most\nartists do, they decided to use their\nnew found stage to show a more sub-tle, introspective vision of their music.\nThey had previously gained moderate success in their homeland Sweden\nby producing typically Scandinavian\neccentric pop music, but their cheesy\nbeats became masterfully intricate\nelectro, combining the simplistic\nsynths of Kraftwerk with rotating\nAphex Twin drums. From the robotic\nbass drums of the intro of \u2018Silent Shout\u2019\nthey create a sparse sound that is built\non with restrained precision to form a\nsound that is as equally unsettling as it\nis playful. The pitch-shifted vocals create a choir of different personalities,\nwith Karin Dreijer Andersson singing\nall the parts as if it were a one-woman\nplay. Her lyrics seem to touch on everyday life, but a life bent until breaking\npoint to fit her dark imaginary reality.\nUnlike many recent critically acclaimed albums, the songs stand in-dividually. \u2018We Share our Mother\u2019s\nHealth\u2019 is a single that is almost per-fect, adding an urgency and simplicity\nthat makes it danceable and likeable\nfrom the first listen. The synth refrain\nitself has an uncanny ability to grasp\nyour attention after every listen.\nThe Knife is currently on hiatus, with\nKarin Dreijer Andersson releasing her\nsolo album \u2018Fever Ray\u2019, which explores\ndomestic psychosis. Her brother has\njust finished writing an electronic opera about the theory of evolution for\nDarwin\u2019s birthday. No matter what\nthe readers of Q would like to think,\nthe Andersson siblings have more significance than the Gallagher\u2019s have had\nin the last 10 years with their rotting\ncorpse of a band.\nReviews\nNot unlike the brooding MGMT with\nits psychedelic industrial drones; if you\nlike new wave, it\u2019s likely this band will\nbe right up your alley. \u2018Bugs On Glue\u2019\nsounds like the clangers sitting in a\njacuzzi having an argument with a kazoo and a vauum cleaner before kicking into cool-as synthpop. The drums\nand synth will march and pull you\nthrough each track respectedly, this\nreally is \u2018close your eyes, nod your head\nand lose yourself in the music\u2019 music.\n- Tom Jennings\n\u201cThe Fame Monster\u201d and self-pro-claimed rock star Lady Gaga presents\nher latest offering in the name of mu-sic, performance art, fashion and just\nplain kookiness. Her new song \u201cBad\nRomance\u201d features everything from\nBaroque harpsichord and distorted\nstrings (no doubt coming from her\nclassical piano training) to throaty\nconsonants bellowed in the form of\n\u2018Roma!\u2019 in homage to her native land\u2019s\ncapital. It\u2019s a dance track like all of her\nothers, the opening lines being as eccentric as always\u2013 \u201cI want your ugly, I\nwant your disease\u201d. It then builds up to\na chorus that somehow anticlimaxes\nin its unfittingly mainstream, \u201cnormal\u201d style. Nevertheless, it has a catchy\nchorus and is effective in its purpose.\nIt\u2019s sure to say that it will engage many\nin an absent-minded humming of its\nmelody upon release. One might even\nnotice the 3 lines of French if they listen carefully. - Joanna Cai\nLADY GAGA\nBAD ROMANCE\nPOLYDOR\nSINGLE Warning! This music contains soft edg-es! The floating melodies with minimal\naccompaniment make it ideal background music to listen to while concentrating on all the studying you said\nyou would do... Even songs that show\na little bit more urgency like \u2018Danger\nPins\u2019 have an ethereal dreamlike quality that seems to charm you and make\nyou want to sigh at their loveliness. \u2018I\nShot The Mayor, Not the Deputy\u2019 is a\npersonal favouite and this album deserves a soothing 2:1. - Tom Jennings\nBEATEN AWAKE\nTHUNDER$TROKE\nFAT POSSUM\nALBUM\nGhana Special review\nby Hugh Crail\nPanama! 3 review by\nKadhim Shubber \u2013\nBoth albums are out\nnow on the fantastic\nSoundway Records\nDIGITAL\nLEATHER\nWARM BROTHER\nFAT POSSUM\nALBUM\nTHE KNIFE\nSILENT\nSHOUT\n2006\nOnly on the web-blag! felixmusic.tk\nI\nt\u2019s difficult to write an informed\nreview of Ghanan afrobeat if\nyou\u2019ve spent your entire life in\nthe home counties listening to\nalternative rock. That said it sounds\nso familliar to me, yet so different. It\nappears to be based around early 70\u2019s\nfunk and r n\u2019 b music but translated\nto fit to the complex cross rythms of\ntraditional african drumming. Famously adopted by Paul Simon in the\n80\u2019s, it\u2019s very relavant to modern music and seems to be about to take over.\nAlready having been adopted by rock\nbands like TV on the Radio, Vampire\nWeekend and Foals, it\u2019s making in-droads into hip hop, being championed by up and coming rappers like\nWale and K\u2019Naan. The effect of this\nmusic is mesmerising, every song on\nthis 2 disc compilation will make you\nwanna get up and dance, but you won\u2019t\nknow how\u2013 what\u2019s more fun than that?\nfelix dives into the\nmusical unknown\nT\nhis mesmerizing record is\nthe third in a series of compilations from Soundway\nRecords. It explores the musical delights of 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s Panama,\nthrough records which the compilers,\nWill Hollan (Quantic), Roberto Gyemant (Beto) and Miles Cleret, found\nin radio station backrooms and dusty\nrecord shops in the unique Isthmus.\nI\u2019ll assume that not many Imperial\nstudents know a thing about this vibrant music scene and you may similarly assume as much about myself.\nHowever, this compilation is presented sympathetically and allows the un-versed listener to form an appreciation\nof the exciting context in which Panamanian musicians mixed language and\nmusical form with obvious success.\nA 22-page booklet accompanies the\ncompilation and greatly enhances the\nexperience. It contains vintage photos\nthat provide a great visual scenery for\nthe music and crucially, the compilers provide enthusiatstic notes which\ncement the compilation\u2019s accessibil-ity. A prime example is in the notes\nfor \u201c20 de Enero en Ocu\u201d where Beto\nhighlights the \u201crumba\u201d of the song by\nnoting the lyrics sung when the section begins.\nBeto hails \u201cChombo Pa\u2019 La Tienda\u201d by Frederick Clarke as the compliation\u2019s \u201ccentrepiece\u201d and, notwithstanding my aforementioned\ninnocence in this area of music,\nI wholeheartedly agree. The title\nroughly translates as \u201cChombo goes\nto the store\u201d and the comedic theatre\nof his mother\u2019s shouting along with\nthe colourful language make it an unforgettable song.\nAs a whole, the compilation is a\nhighly enjoyable record which will appeal to anyone with a curious ear.\n\u2022 felix music charts, find out who\u2019s No1!\n\u2022 \u201cPolitical music doesn\u2019t have to be shit\u201d\n\u2022 Do Make Say Think album review\n\u2022 Mechanical Bride live at the ICA\nHeads up skaters!\nfelix is giving away three copies of the\nfantastic soundtrack to bat-shit awesome\nskate film Extremely Sorry\nThe soundtrack, mixed by legendary\nproducer and DJ Baron, features\ncollaborations with artists such as\nLemmy Kilmister (MOTORHEAD),\nDave Lombardo (SLAYER), Black\nMountain, Early Man, ((SOUNDER))\nSnoop Dogg and Warren G.\nTo win, answer the\nfollowing not-so-difficult question:\nWhat was Flip\nSkateboards known\nas before 1994?\nSend your answers\nto music.felix@gmail.\ncom\n\n"

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 13 NOVEMBER 2009\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nThe war for neutrality rages\nW\nith all the debates on\nknobbly vegetables, it\u2019s\neasy to forget that the\nEuropean Parliament\nplays a huge role in the way that we\nall live. MEPs from all over Europe are\ncurrently debating the proposed \u2018Telecoms Reforms Package\u2019, which will put\nin place new laws to regulate the way\nwe use and access the Internet here in\nthe EU. In doing so they will decide the\noutcome of the most important, yet\nleast reported, debate the Internet has\never faced, about \u2018net neutrality\u2019. What\nis decided now on net neutrality will\nshape the way the Internet grows and\nchanges, and will ultimately affect the\nway we work and play in the future.\nOK it\u2019s important, I get that, but what\nthe hell is net neutrality? Well simply\nput, net neutrality is the principal that\nall information on the web should be\ntreated equally.\n\u2018Net neutrality is\nthe principal that all\ninformation on the web\nshould be treated equally.\u2019\nTim Berners-Lee, often credited\nwith invention of the web, defines it as\n\u201cthe freedom of connection, with any\napplication, to any party\u201d, meaning that\neverybody should be able to use their\nInternet connection without any sort\nof limit to access whatever they want.\nIf you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s how it works\nalready, then you\u2019d be right, but all that\ncould soon change.\nTelecoms companies such as Virgin\nMedia in the UK, as well as Comcast\nand AT&T in the US, have expressed\ninterest in limiting or blocking access\nto certain websites owned by competitors or charging website owners a\nfee to have their site delivered at unrestricted speeds to users as they are\nat the moment. Those who couldn\u2019t\npay would have traffic from their sites\nslowed down through traffic shaping\nor even stopped from passing across\nthe company\u2019s network.\nHopefully by now it\u2019s pretty easy to\nsee why net neutrality is a good thing.\nFreedom on the Internet has been the\nmain reason that the web has grown\ninto the powerful tool we know today,\nwith surfers able to drive innovation\nof ideas and technology from their\nback bedrooms or garages. No-one can\ndoubt this innovative force when they\nremember that Google, Skype, eBay\nand Twitter, tools many of us use daily,\nwere all started by a regular person with\nan idea.\nWithout a neutral Internet it would\nmake it hard for those sites to even\ncome into existence today as single\nSimon Worthington reports on why your freedom to use the net as you choose is at risk\nwith the European Parliament considering a non-neutral Internet as ISPs line their coffers\ndevelopers struggle to pay the fees required to get their idea noticed.\nAnti-neutrality systems would be\nbeneficial for the present day Google\nand eBay though, as it would help to\nstifle their competition and generally\nreduce the competitiveness of the Internet as a whole. Big companies like\nAmazon could afford the prices to have\ntheir service upgraded whilst smaller\ncompanies offering the same home-delivery services wouldn\u2019t be able to pay\nthe money and keep low prices and so\nwould fall out of the market. This is of\nan obvious disadvantage to me and you,\nbecause loss of competitiveness would\nhamper the drive to the low Internet\nprices we know and love. Enforcing\nneutrality across the web would help\nensure even small companies get a slice\nof custom and so can make the market\ncompetitive.\nAnother area in which the Internet\nis often applauded is free speech, with\nblogs providing a platform for any-Google\nacquires\nAdMob\nThis week Google extended its advertising reach deeper into the mobile market with the acquisition of the\nmobile advertising leader, AdMob.\nThe purchase is reported to have cost\nGoogle $750 million in stock, making\nwaves in the relatively small mobile ad\nserving market. It\u2019s important to note\nthat the mobile ad serving market benefits from the lack of widely available\nad-blocking technology that plagues\nthe desktop market meaning that in\nmost cases each ad served is in fact\nseen.\nGoogle already had a mobile advertising system in place that mimicked\nit\u2019s signature Google Adsense text ads\nfrom the desktop. In purchasing AdMob, Google not only buys a significant market share but also the technology for mobile display ads. Google\u2019s\nVP of engineering, Vic Gundotra said\nthat acquiring the AdMob engineering\nteam was critical to Google\u2019s acceleration of its mobile ad efforts.\nAdMob, which has good links with\ncontent providers and the lucrative\nmobile app space, will propel Google\nto the forefront of the mobile sector.\nHaving Google leading the charge in\nmobile ads may also see an expansion\nof the market sector, especially with\nGoogle\u2019s tie-ins with its open-source\nAndroid operating system. The mobile\napp space, which has seen rapid expansion on the iPhone and Android platforms in recent years, has increasingly\nseen ad supported programs providing a potentially lucrative market for\nGoogle to have bought into.\nset up a company to do it better. WarMouse is aiming this at the OpenOffice MMO playing crowd and they\nmight go potty over it, but I think I\u2019ll\nstick to my trusty Logitech thanks.\nThis week Mozilla had a party to celebrate Firefox turning the big 5-noth-ing. Yes that\u2019s right, the browser of\nchoice for the web savvy, but Google\nhating, user really is five years old. The\nproject which grew out of the death of\nthe Mozilla suite (aka Netscape Navigator) celebrated its fifth birthday by\nbeing crowned the vulnerability king\nand not in a good way.\nA recent study found that Firefox\nsuffered from 44% of the total vulnerabilities affecting todays browsers.\nSafari, which includes Mobile Safari\ncame in second and the normal culprit\nof the browser wars Internet Explorer\ncame in at number three. The winner\nin all this happens to be the least used\nbrowser Opera.\nNow I know there are Opera fanboys\nabout and for good reason, it\u2019s fast and\nreliable, but it goes to show there\u2019s\nsafety through minority.\nSpeaking of vulnerabilities, this week\nit\u2019s emerged that there\u2019s a new threat\nfrom the computer virus. Your normal\neveryday virus either wants to steal information from you, send out a load of\nspam or turn your computer into part\nof a botnet. Although that\u2019s pretty inconvenient and could potentially be\ndamaging to your finances or identity,\nit doesn\u2019t come close to causing jail\ntime for the infected.\nA new type of virus has started to\ncrop up which paedophiles use to essentially store their collections of kiddy\nporn on your computer. Now this is\npretty disturbing just from the thought\nof kiddy porn being on your computer and some hideous person accessing it for their \u2018needs\u2019. But you might\nbe shocked to know that it might even\nlead to you facing a conviction for pae-dophilia because who\u2019s going to believe\n\u2018a virus did it\u2019 claim? It all comes down\nto the fact that the exams that courts do\non your computer are costly and they\ndon\u2019t like paying for them meaning\nthey\u2019re often skipped. In essence unless you fork out a pretty penny for the\nexam you could be convicted straight\nup for having kiddy porn. So next time\nyou click on that .exe or browse that\ndodgy website with the \u2018free stuff\u2019 just\nthink twice and always use protection.\nNEC this week showed off its Tele\none and everyone to air their views on\nwhatever they want. There have been\ncountless examples in Internet history\nwhere bloggers have made a difference\nin the real world, in everything from the\nrevival of Family Guy to your screens,\nto forcing the resignation of ethically\nambiguous US Senator Trent Lott. Everyone can contribute equally, and with\nthat comes choice and diversity. Without a neutral network the playing field\nisn\u2019t level any more. Rich commentators\nwould have more impact on discussion\nbecause they wield the financial power\nto get themselves a better quality of\nservice.\nThankfully, it\u2019s not too late just yet\nto do something about this. There are\nseveral campaigns (Internet based, of\ncourse) to fight for net neutrality, and\nmany of them have active petitions.\nIf you want more information, go to\nwww.laquadrature.net for the lowdown on net neutrality in Europe, and\nalso check out the rather corny sounding www.savetheinternet.com. Whatever you do, don\u2019t just sit there, because\nyour freedom to browse, play and work\nacross the internet really is at risk. In\nthe end, the governments and commissions have to listen to somebody, and\nit\u2019s either going to be us or the telecom\ncompanies looking to line their wallets.\nWho would you rather it was?\n\u2018Whatever you do, don\u2019t\njust sit there, because\nyour freedom to browse,\nplay and work across the\ninternet really is at risk.\u2019\nfantastic enough, NEC aims integrate\nthis technology with real-time spoken\nlanguage translation which would give\nthe wearer the ability to read translated\ntext projected into their eye balls when\nsomeone speaks to them in a foreign\nlanguage.\nOK, I know that sounds a bit fishy,\nbut we\u2019re nowhere near April and it\u2019s\nnot inconceivable that with advances\nin voice recognition, this kind of system could revolutionise the way we\ncommunicate in foreign countries.\nFor the time being NEC said the Tele\nScouter glasses could be implemented\nusing facial recognition to give salesmen an overview of a particular clients\nrecent purchases.\nNEC hopes to have the glasses tested\nand available in November 2010. I just\nhope they can build in a bit of Terminator style augmented reality for the\nultimate wearable computer system.\nForget Layar and the other phone\nbased augmented reality apps, having\ninfo beamed into your eyes is definitely\nthe way forward.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nAnother week in tech has passed us\nby and what do we have to show for\nit? How about the hideous looking\nOpenOffice Mouse?\nFeaturing 18 buttons, 63 programmable profiles and even an analogue\njoystick, this instant carpul tunnel surgery inducing monstrosity is soon to\nhit the stores for the bargain price of\n\u00a345. Obviously not a fan of the MagicMouse, a World of Warcraft-loving\ngamer decided his mouse didn\u2019t have\nenough buttons and went ahead and\nScouter glasses in Tokyo.

To relax myself\nI played some Arcade Fire on my ipod\nand suddenly I was transported into\nanother dimension - that of film.\nYes it sounds ridiculous but I actually imagined that I was a character\nin a low-budget indie drama. Various depressing scenarios started to\nflow around my head; a close friend\nor relative had died and I was looking\nfor answers amongst the mean streets\nof South Kensington or I was searching for my junky biological father after\nlearning I was adopted - all backed up\nby the sombre tones of Arcade Fire.\nI know I have a strange mind at times\nand it can be perhaps a bit too creative\nbut I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all had similar ex-periences. Maybe you\u2019re sitting on a\nbus in the rain with your earphones in\nand then a sad song comes on and you\nfind your head slowly turning to stare\nout of the window in despair. It\u2019s not\nthat you\u2019re genuinely upset, it\u2019s just\nsometimes your brain unconsciously\nconstructs fabricated surroundings in\na reaction to the music you\u2019re listening\nto.\nI decided to experiment with this ef-fect. I put on some Arctic Monkeys,\nthe music of my homeland (Yorkshire).\nNothing in my behaviour changed\napart from my accent which has the\nhabit of acclimatising when I\u2019m around\nother northerners. However The Prodigy had me itching for some violence in\na typical footy hooliganism film. Next\nBobby Dylan placed me on an open\nroad in the American Mid-West travelling in no particular direction.\nI was really enjoying myself so I tried\nsome iconic music from famous films.\nThe Rolling Stones Jumpin\u2019 Jack Flash\ndid not turn me into Robert de Niro as\nI had hoped but Iggy Pop\u2019s Lust for Life\ndid put me in the mood for some shoplifting and being chased down King\nStreet by police. Unfortunately Wagner\u2019s Ride of the Valkyries only reminded me how annoyed I get when another lazy advert parodies Apocalypse\nNow (British Gas are the culprits this\ntime). Finally I dared to walk through\nHammersmith late at night with the\n28 Days Later soundtrack in my ears. I\nmust admit, it did freak me out slightly.\nI suppose I\u2019m trying to highlight how\nimportant music is to a film, imagine\nJaws, Psycho and The Great Escape\nwithout their fantastic tunes? Anyway\nenough of my rambling, this week I\u2019ve\nslaved over a French themed special\nfilm section. We are extremely lucky to\nhave Cin\u00e9 lumi\u00e8re just around corner\nso read the article and then hurry your\nbums down to fill their seats!\nThe Ten Best French Films\nLes Quatres cent coups (the 400\nblows). Usually mis-translated the title actually means \u2018raising merry hell\u2019.\nTruffaut\u2019s ode to youth is a semi autobiographical account following the\nrebellious Antoine as he tries to break\nfrom the rules of society. The famous\nending will leave you in a pensieve\nmood for weeks.\nAmelie; the French film that everyone\nhas seen. It\u2019s a joy to watch of course\nand Audrey Tatou shines as the selfless protagonist who learns to find love\nin the city full of it.\nLa Haine. Hate fuelled troubles in the\nother side of Paris as suburban youths\nlook for revenge against violent police.\nThe Taxi Driver of French cinema, La\nHaine is shot in stylish black and white\nand always holds your attention. Did\nyou see the cow?\nJean Claude taught me this hold\nDelicatessen. Post-nuclear apocalyptic France involves the surreal tale of\nblack market human meat, militant\nvegetarians, saw playing clowns and\npatched up condoms. Pure genius\nfrom Jeunet and Caro (Amelie)\nThat\u2019s going to make quite a headache\nAu Revoir les Enfants. One of the\nfew films that has brought me to tears.\nStudents at a boarding school run by\nmonks in Vichy France are puzzled by\nthe arrival of three new curly haired\nstudents who don\u2019t take communion.\nA lot of life lessons to be learnt and the\nmost harrowing ending of a film ever.\nLes Visiteurs. The best French comedy ever. Two knights find themeselves\nout of the depth after been transported\nto modern times by a witch. Their first\nexperience with a car tops anything\nBasil Fawlty could do.\nShould I be scared or laugh?\nJean de Florette/Manon des Sources. Bonjour Monsieur Depardieu! Set\nin rural Provence, these gentle tales\nof greed and revenge are some of the\nmost beautiful films ever committed to\ncelluloid.\nThe Choir. Mixed critical reception,\nI loved it. A new master at a borstal\nslowly wins over the troubled boys\nthrough the power of singing. Think\nGoodbye Mr. Chips en fran\u00e7ais!\nBelle de Jour. Bored young housewife becomes prostitute to suffice her\nneeds and fantasies. Sounds like your\ncontemporary gritty drama. This film\nwas released in 1967 by the legendary\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel and is probably the sexiest film ever made (Come, on this is a\nFrench film list!)\nSexy non?\nBreathless. French cinema at its most\nbrilliant, pretentious best.\nGodard\u2019s breakout is a love affair to\ncinema with all the classic conventions\nof French New Wave in this pseudo\nNoir story. Ignore the plot, this is how\nfilms should be made; pure auteur\ntheory.\nEd Knock runs through his reckoning of the best Gallic films\nWe all admire Jennifer\u2019s Body\nProgramme:\nMemory, A season of European documentaries\nM\nemory celebrates the\nwealth and diversity of contemporary\ndocumentary films\nin Europe. The festival runs for six days (15-21 November),\nand is now in its third year. It will showcase the work of new and established\ndirectors from across the continent.\nCommunism and its fall is a strong\ntheme in the festival. Children of the\nDecree is a chilling look at the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his\nenforcement of the infamous Decree\n770, which banned birth control and\nabortion.\nOther highlights include Up! November 1989, followed by a panel discussion which brings together the key\nrepresentatives of the November revolutionary forces. To mark the 20th anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, there\nwill be three shorts forming a screening\nentitled Close.

No, seriously.\nFox shot to fame playing the improbably hot love interest of \u2018that guy from\nEven Stevens\u2019 Shia LaBeouf, in the\nsummer blockbuster pap, Transformers. Fox\u2019s newest role sees her playing\nJennifer, the most popular girl in high\nschool who, after an unfortunate inci-dent, becomes inhabited by the soul of\na demon and in order to sustain herself\nin her new demon infected state must\ntrack down and feed on men.\nThe whole film seems confused\nas to what exactly it\u2019s trying to be, it\nflitters between angsty teen drama,\nlightweight horror and situation com-edy. What emerges is a film that does\nnothing particularly well. Some scenes\nin the film stick out jarringly. You can\nalmost hear the cogs working in the\nminds of the cynical movie moguls as\nyou watch Fox swim naked, and have\na lesbian kiss, for seemingly no other\nreason than appeasing male viewers.\nAfter all, we all know demons are renowned for their liking of skinny dipping and sexual experimentation.\nBut then it\u2019s obvious why this film\nwas made. It was never going to push\nthe boundaries of modern cinema. But\nwhat confuses me is why Megan Fox,\nafter gaining huge success in Transformers, and now presumably able to\npick pretty much whichever role she\nwants, chose this as her next part. But,\nbad career decisions aside, Jennifer\u2019s\nBody is a film which is probably best\navoided. However if you\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to stare at Megan Fox\nfor two hours without feeling guilty\nafterwards, this may just be the film\nyou\u2019ve been waiting for.\nFilm Editor\nOh you still would, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\n"

Despite admitting to not being\nthe greatest of doubles players, both\nImperial pairs came through strongly\nagainst their opponents.\nOur first pair consisting of skipper\nPio, and Frenchman Pierre, had a close\nmatch. Even at 7-7, the Imperial boys\nkicked up a gear to take the match 9-7.\nSecond pair Avinash and fresher Adam\nmade quick work of their opponents to\nwin 8-4. A special mention must go\nto Avinash whose volleys during the\nmatch would have put Pistol Pete\u2019s (i.e.\nSampras) to shame.\nFor the first time this season, the\nImperial lads were 2-0 up before the\nsingles started \u2013 a position which they\nwill hopefully be familiar with by the\nend of the season. Adam and Avinash,\nIC Men\ncause a\nracket in\nBrighton\nplaying at 3 and 4 won comfortably, 6-0\n6-0 and 6-0 6-1 respectively.\nOur esteemed captain Pio (playing at\n1) was back in form taking the first set\n6-2 and at 5-3, 40-0 up in the second,\nvictory seemed inevitable.

After a performance deemed as\n\u201cNot good enough and not to the level\nrequired to gain\u201d the half-expected\npromotion, last week against Chichester, Wednesday\u2019s trip to the University of Surrey became the third \u2018biggest\ngame of the season\u2019 in a row.\nThough an average start has been\nmade, the quality of football played by\n1st XI has at times been of the quality to fight for promotion into the 2nd\nSouth Eastern division. The \u2018imperialitis\u2019 of falling apart in the second half\nhas resulted in leads being reduced to\ndraws and closely fought games ending\nin narrow losses.\nTo this fact, Botchway decided to\nadopt narrow midfield formation\nwith wing-backs Theocharis Tofis and\nGavin Graham having the freedom to\nuse the flanks. Within 10 minutes of\nthe start, fresher Nathan Ferrol continued his hot-streak of scoring in every\ngame he has played in with a cool finish to the goalkeeper\u2019s near post, after\njinking past the Surrey right back.\nJust before the twenty minute mark,\nSurrey had equalised after a loose ball\nrebounded off Botchway and fell fortunately to the Surrey centre midfielder\nwho slotted it into the empty net.\nA well worked free-kick by Romain\nChauvet fell to debutante Tim Lunn\nwhose header was stabbed in by Leslie\nEshun on the rebound. Lax defending\nof a set piece led the ball falling to the\nSurrey midfielder who finished it well\nin to the bottom corner.\nThe score 2 a-piece at half time, and\nthe new formation working well, the\nteam were encouraged to increase the\nwork-rate and improve communication to ensure consolidation on their\nfirst-half domination of possession.\nA miss-kick by the Imperial captain\ngifted Surrey a goal to go 3-2 up before\nthe 55 minute mark.\nThe outfield players responded\nstrongly to this increase in pressure\nand after impressive composure from\nthe centre backs Tom Fryatt and Pat\nMcMullen, along with midfielder and\ndebutante, Jon Hill led to a counter-at-tack which fell to Eshun who lifted the\nball over the out-running goalkeeper\nto equalise 15 minutes from time.\nThe reversal in momentum in Imperial\u2019s favour was rewarded when Eshun\ncompleted his second hat-trick of the\nseason after reacting well to knock in\nthe rebound off his first shot, 7 minutes from time.\nA vital away win for the 1st XI now\nrestores our aims for this season and\nwill put them in good spirits for next\nweek\u2019s BUCS Cup 2nd round match\nagainst London South Bank University.\nRoad to Victory - How Haye\u2019s got to the Title Fight\nThe Haye-maker hits home\nB\nigger is not always bet-ter. This point was proved\nperfectly by Britain\u2019s new\nWBA heavyweight champion David Haye in Nuremburg on Saturday night when he beat\nthe gigantic Nikolai Valuev on a majority points decision. In victory Haye\nbecame the first British Heavyweight\nchampion since Lennox Lewis who\nretired in 2003 and he has already got\nhis sights set on one of the Klitschko\nbrothers Vitali and Wladimir who hold\nthe other World heavyweight titles.\nAny unification fight will however;\nhave to wait primarily for Haye\u2019s right\nhand to heal from a suspected fracture\nsustained during the Vauev fight. Secondly Haye will need to successfully\nnegotiate a mandatory defence of his\ntitle against former champion John\nRuiz.\nHaye himself has publicly stated\nthroughout the build up to the fight\nand indeed this week after winning\nthe title that he has dreamt of becoming the heavyweight champion since\nhe was a little boy. However, his coronation some may feel is slightly over-due: Haye established himself as an\nexplosive power puncher in the cruiserweight division, the weight below\nheavyweight. He won 18 from 19 contests with seventeen victories coming\nthrough knocking his opponent out.\nAt this stage in his career Haye had yet\nto win a world title and cement himself as a big player in the cruiserweight\ndivision. Despite this he stepped up to\nheavyweight for his next fight in April\n2007 where he destroyed Tomasz Bonin within one round proving he could\ntransfer his destructive punching up to\nthe heavier weight division. Even this\ncommanding victory was not enough\nto appease some critics who thought\nthat to prove he was the best cruiserweight in the division, Haye needed to\nfight the French cruiserweight world\nchampion; Jean-Marc Mormeck. Not\na man to shy away from the challenge,\nHaye fought Mormeck in France picking himself off the canvas after being\nknocked down to defeat the champion\nin the seventh round, proving himself\nto be a world class fighter. One final\nfight at cruiserweight followed against\nthe Welshman Enzo Maccarinelli.\nMaccarinelli was knocked out in the\nsecond round following a barrage of\npunches from Haye. Before last Saturdays fight against Valuev Haye had\nfought just once more at heavyweight\nalmost a year ago, beating former\nDavid Wilson Sports Editor\nheavyweight hopeful Monte Barrat.\nSince then a fight with the aforementioned Vitali Klitschko fell through\nand a fight with Wladimir in June\nthis year had to be cancelled as Haye\ninjured his back whilst training. So to\nsay that David Haye has had to bide his\ntime before becoming become heavyweight champion is somewhat of an\nunderstatement.\nBefore Saturdays fight Haye talked\nhimself up insisting he would knock\nout the 7ft 2\u201d, 23 stone Valuev, who in\nall 52 previous fights had never been\nproperly shaken. Throughout the build\nup Haye goaded the champion calling\nhim a \u2018circus freak\u2019, taking a pop at Valuev\u2019s hygiene and comically decapitating a cardboard cut out of the big Russian at a press conference. Haye oozes\nconfidence, he will never enter the ring\nthinking that anything but a victory for\nhim is possible, and this is exactly the\nattitude that a boxer needs. His confidence and the ways in which Haye can\nsometimes act such as his brashness\nand swagger shown before this fight\nhave, for some people, made him a difficult character to like. Like him or not\nbut David Haye is exactly the character that is needed to spark some much\nneeded life into what has been, for recent years, a dormant and boring division both in the ring and out. Haye is\nan articulate and confident young man\noh, and he has proved he can box a bit\ntoo, at 29 years old he is a spring chicken of the heavyweight ranks. He talks\nthe talk and backs it up with victories,\nhis pre fight antics are reminiscent of\nAli while his power, although not as\ndevastating is a throwback to Tyson\u2019s\none punch knock outs. His ambition is\nto become the undisputed heavyweight\nchampion and retire by the age of 31. It\nremains to be seen if this will remain\na realistic aspiration as too many boxers retire but cannot live without the\nring and return to fight as a shadow of\ntheir former selves with George Foreman, Larry Holmes and Mike Tyson\nbeing prime examples. However this\nweek it has been reported that Haye\ncould earn around \u00a372million from a\nshowdown with a Klitschko brother in\nAmerica, getting up to train is always\nharder when you sleep in silk sheets.\nHaye entered the ring on Saturday\nseven stone lighter and almost a foot\nshorter than his Russian opponent.\nValuev is a spectacle his entrance to\nthe ring was just comical though especially the sight of his diminutive\ntrainer, Alexander Zimin, scurrying\nbehind him. Haye\u2019s camp were decked\nout in blue shirts which symbolised the\nfight plan for the night. This was the\nfirst sign that Haye was bluffing when\nhe had claimed he was going to knock\nout the champion as the team wore\nred shirts the night Maccarinelli was\nbeaten in what was always going to be a\nquick fight. Haye fought a perfect fight\nin the 10,000 seat arena using slick\nspeed to move in and out, landing consistent punches and using the whole\nring space evading the lumbering\nchampion. Valuev seemed glued to the\ncentre of the ring, few shots he threw\nlanded due to Haye\u2019s elusiveness. Haye\nwas no doubt the better boxer of the\ntwo with his work rate and boxing ability superior to that of the champion;\nhowever whether he was being \u2018busy\u2019\nenough to get the decision from the\njudges was not a full gone conclusion.\nHaye finished in the twelfth round\nwith a flourish wobbling the giant Russian with a crunching left hand but\nboth boxers remained standing as the\nround finished. As is the Haye way he\ncelebrated enthusiastically confident\nhe was the new champion. After an\nanxious wait for the judges\u2019 scorecards\nto be collected Haye won on a majority\ndecision with two scores of 116-112 in\nhis favour and the third judge scoring a\n114-114 draw.\nHaye now has numerous commitments to attend to as the new champion before he can start training for his\nnext fight in the New Year.

It has\ngrown exponentially out of an MIT\ncourse into an annual event attracting over 1200 participants from more\nthan 110 teams this year from across\nthe globe. Projects have ranged from\nbanana and wintergreen smelling bac-teria, through an arsenic biosensor, to\nbuoyant bacteria.\nImperial College won the prize for\nthe best manufacturing project; the\nprize for the best consideration of\nethical issues in relation to device de-sign; a gold medal and came fourth\noverall. The Imperial team had spent\nthe summer working on their \u2018encapsulator\u2019 project.\nThe pill, the first of its kind, is\nself-manufacturing in the sense that\nit can produce a drug and then also\nproduce an acid-resistant capsule\naround itself. Each encapsulator can\nproduce one of a number of different\ndrugs, making it a universal platform\nthat can be widely used in the pharmaceuticals industry.\nThe challenge for competitors is\nto specify, design, build, and test\nsimple biological systems using only\nstandard, interchangeable biological parts. The teams presented their\nprojects at the iGEM Championship\nJamboree between October 30 and\nNovember 2, but the Imperial team\nthen decided to have a holiday in\nnearby New York, and so only gotww\nback this week. felix managed to get\nan interview with three of the team\nmembers.\nThe team spent four months genetically altering cells so that they\ncould manufacture a drug - such\nas an enzyme or protein needed to\ntreat a disease - inside themselves,\non demand. Pills usually need an\nacid-resistant shell in order to pass\nthe stomach and reach the intestine\nwithout being ruined.\nThe unique aspect of this project\nwas enabling the cell to then make\nthis acid-resistant shell and encapsulate itself. Encapsulation is an especially important issue as the problem\nof safe transport to the intestine has\nbeen a major barrier for the rapidly\ngrowing biological drugs field. The\nteam also encoded a control mechanism for the \u2018encapsulation\u2019 process,\nwhich is triggered automatically using\ngenetic switches.\nThe Imperial team has thus shown\nthat cells can be used as safe, flexible\nand controllable drug making devices.\nThe implications of this could be significant for the pharmaceutical sector,\nwhich may be why drug manufacturers have already approached the team\nabout possible research opportunities\nto further develop their concept.\nThey also used modelling techniques to show it would be possible\nto induce the bacterial cell to delete\nits own genome, effectively killing it-self, once the drug has been made and\nthe encapsulation process completed.\nThis would render it completely in-animate, and therefore more palatable\nas a drug for human consumption.\nThis aspect of the project led to them\nwinning the award for the best consideration of ethical issues in relation\nto device design.\nProfessor Richard Kitney from Imperial\u2019s Department of Bioengineering,\nwho co-led Imperial\u2019s students along\nwith Professor Paul Freemont and Dr\nGeoff Baldwin from the Department of\nLife Sciences, congratulated the team,\nsaying: \u201cThey did an absolutely brilliant job with a technically challenging project. The idea of having an all-in-one bacterial drug production and\npill-like delivery unit is revolutionary.\nIt could offer a low-cost, simple and\nefficient way of producing drugs that\ncan be safely delivered to the human\nintestine. That\u2019s why iGEM is such a\nfantastic competition \u2013 it gives undergraduates a unique chance to get their\nteeth into a ground-breaking research\nproject, and explore ideas that could\nchange the world.\u201d\nProfessors Kitney and Freemont,\nwho co-direct Imperial\u2019s newly-founded Centre for Synthetic Biology and Innovation, say the students\u2019\nwork will now be developed in their\nlab, with particular focus on research\nto develop the synthetic biology device into a more general delivery system where drugs need to bypass the\nstomach. This was Imperial\u2019s fourth\nyear of participating in the event and\nthe deadline for applying to join next\nyear\u2019s team is fast approaching. Whilst\nsome of the other teams are thought\nto be strongly encouraged to choose\nparticular topics, the teams that compete at iGEM from Imperial are completely free to pick their own topic. At\nthe same time, they receive tutoring\nThe 2009 Imperial team in a group photograph ahead of the iGEM competition\nThe team has asked interested undergraduate students\nto send, as soon as possible,\ntheir CVs to:\nimperial.igem2010@gmail.com.\nfrom the staff supervisors that the\nteam described as \u2018unparalleled.\u2019\nThere is also a charitable element to\nthe project as Imperial help UCL with\ntheir attempts, because they have less\nexperience and because they generally\nneed help. In addition, the teams also\nget a kit from the Registry of Standard\nBiological Parts.\nThis year\u2019s team comprised Bioengineering and Life Sciences students,\nbut the team is keen to attract talent\nfrom all different departments for\nnext year, as they believe a variety of\nskills will be helpful.\n\n"

So\ndoes my grandfather \u2013 at the age\nof 78 \u2013 and my grandmother, even\nafter a double knee replacement.\nOutside of Mumbai\u2019s elite, most Indians\nwill find it more trouble than necessary\nto start their engines for a trip to the local shops. Of course, it could be that Fleur\nThomas was being ironic but the rest of\nher article reads as the experiences of\nsomeone who decided to travel abroad on\na whim without reading up on the desti-nation. Indeed, the article itself provides\nan unabashed critique of Indian traffic\nmasquerading as advice, something sadly\nsymptomatic of the lack of effort shown\nby tourists towards understanding a locality bemoaned by Dylan Lowe\u2019s piece a\nmonth ago.\nIn fact, most of what Ms Thomas says\ncontains a vague element of truth that is\nlost in the mists of \u2018humour\u2019. It is far less\neloquent and knowledgeable than the\naverage Lonely Planet guide, which any\ndiligent traveller should have stuffed in\nhis back pocket anyway. Traps exist certainly but exaggerating aspects of a country that occur all over the world simply\ndiverts attention from them. Incidentally,\nthat dripping \u2018liquid\u2019 is water from the\nexhaust.\nFirstly, it is no secret that Indian traffic is chaotic. The population is im-mense, and expecting the roads not to be\ncrowded is like going to Fabric without\nexpecting to be approached by drug dealers every five minutes. Crossing the road\nis based on instinct, and other road users\ntend to swerve to avoid you anyway; problems only occur when you hesitate, something also true of places like Vietnam and\nThailand.\nAuto drivers only tend to play up if they\nspot weakness or aggression on your part,\nyet they are still safer than your average\nunlicensed minicab. Do not be fooled by\nthe flashy N95 in his hand, it will have\ncost him his last three month\u2019s earn-ings. As a tourist, chances are you have\nmore money (and less nous) than a lo-cal, hence his persistence in getting your\nfare. The mode of transport is basic in\nthe kindest terms and cheap to use even\nat the \u2018foreigner rate\u2019. If someone fresh\noff the boat went to Portobello Market,\ndo you think the traders would refrain\nfrom ripping him off? Groups of stationary autos should be avoided as the drivers are friends who tend to bargain as a\ncollective. Auto drivers in motion will\nsometimes even squabble for your atten-tion. Regardless, ask for half of what he\nquotes and haggle like you mean business \u2013 chances are he will slash his price.\nThis attitude works in all markets in the\nworld, can it not be extended towards\ntransportation?\nPublic transport in India is heavily\nsubsidised and so has a negligible effect\non your bank balance. They are understandably crowded, but it is nothing if\nyou have used the District line during\nrush hour. They break down less often\ntoo. If you want luxury, then you can still\nhire an air-conditioned car for a full day\u2019s\nusage. This comes at the same price as a\none-way trip between London City and\nHeathrow Airport.\nIn terms of safety, my mother and her\ncontemporaries have all used the buses\nfor years (nay, decades) without any problems whatsoever. In my case, the only\ntimes I have ever felt threatened occurred\non the Tube. Should you find yourself in\ntrouble, screaming blue murder will result in the satisfaction of seeing your assailant being clobbered by helpful stran-gers, and is especially true for women and\nforeigners.\nThe truth is, I could have also singled\nout aspects of any country\u2019s structure\nciting some personal experience as justification (eight of the world\u2019s worst cities for pickpockets are European, how\nappalling!). Outside of Western Europe\nand North America, most of the world is\nstill quite poor and suffers from poor or-ganisation. As a traveller, you can choose\nto highlight common issues negatively, or\nyou can adapt and offer constructive advice on how to deal with the real issues\nyou will face. If you cannot do the latter,\nthen stay at home, because it is your attitude that is the real problem.\nAditya Narayanan is scornful of last week\u2019s featured article, and offers his perspective on travelling\nArrogance is expecting things laid on a plate for you\nT\no spot an extraordinaire in\nthe middle of Power Shift,\na climate change conference\nhosted by the UK Youth Climate Coalition, is like finding a needle in a needle sack.\nNot so much about the fact that there\nwas ingenuity in every corner of the Institute of Education \u2013 the venue playing\nhost to the event \u2013 but the overwhelming humility that prickles when I waded\nthrough a sea of individual whose portfolios are at least a hundred times more\nillustrious than mine.\nIan Katz, the Deputy Editor of the\nGuardian, whizzed by; I expressed my\ngratitude for my nomination and him\ndismissing any responsibility for granting me such prestige. Any chance with\nseizing the opportunity and conduct an\ninterview with him? Not a chance.\nLucy struck me as the \u2018someone else\u2019.\nHer stage presence, though slightly undermined by a lack of experience, was\nno less spectacular, especially when our\njudgement was based on the achievement\nof the speakers in the \u2018environmental\u2019 cir-cles. But the concept of what she spoke\nabout \u2013 and its sheer scale \u2013 snatched\nmy attention, especially when I was still\ngrief-struck from returning from the\nSouth Pacific only weeks ago.\nAnd so I approached her, found a spot\nwithin the cacophonous conference hall,\nand fired away with questions at a young\nexplorer whose deeds would shame me a\nthousand times.\nDylan Lowe Hi guys, your travel\neditor here, at the first day of Power\nShift where I\u2019ve heard from speakers talking about their work they\u2019ve\nbeen doing, Lucy here being one of\nthem.\nLucy Shepherd Hi.\nDL So you\u2019re about to embark on an\namazing adventure \u2013 tell me more\nabout it?\nLS I\u2019m off the Arctic wilderness of Svalbard for ten weeks in April 2011 with the\nBritish School of Expedition Society.\nDL Like I said earlier, well done for\nbeing the most courageous girl I\u2019ve\never met.\nLS Thank you.\nDL I applied to go on an Antarctic\nexpedition once, though what BP\nsaid to me is that they don\u2019t usually\naccept first-years, and that I was too\nyoung and inexperienced. Being a\nseventeen-year-old, what makes you\nthink that they accepted you for the\ntrip?\nLS I think I showed the right skills, and\nthe right experiences \u2013 they don\u2019t really want to take first-timers. I\u2019ve just returned from Nepal in the summer. You\nhave to be quite motivated, work well as\npart of a team.\nDL And the selection process?\nLS I saw an advert in the paper for BSES\nexpeditions. Went onto the website and\ndownloaded an application form. It was a\nbit like the questions you answer in a personal statement or interview: for exam-ple, why do you want to go, what would\nyou bring to the team, your experience in\nextreme environments and mountainous\nareas. If you impressed the guys at BSES\nthen you get invited to an interview. A\nfew weeks after the interview you get a\nyes or no.\nDL What is the most daunting thing\nabout the trip you can imagine?\nLS The idea of \u2013 even though it\u2019s never\ndark with 24-hour daylight \u2013 getting out\nof my tent one morning and perhaps seeing a polar bear.\nDL Really?\nLS Because apparently it happens quite\noften. And staying in a tent for ten weeks\nin -25o\nC will be a bit frustrating. [Chuck-les] And no washing.\nDL Well, you haven\u2019t been through\nuniversity life, have you?\nLS Not yet.\nDL You\u2019ll get to experience untidiness then.\nLS [Laughs]\nDL On the contrary, what do you\nreckon would be the most fun part\nof it?\nLS Meeting new people, spending time\nin that kind of situation. We\u2019ll be hacking through ice and snow, travelling long\ndistances by sledges and skis. It\u2019ll be ten\nweeks of constant adventures, constant\nchallenges. Not to mention travelling on\ndog sleds.\nDL Sounds awesome. So you\u2019ll be\ncoming off the trip \u2013 will you be going to university soon?\nLS Hopefully.\nDL It\u2019ll be weird for you as you\u2019ll\nbe going into university, and everybody would have come straight from\nschool; you would have been through\na year in the University of Life. You\nwould have done all these amazing\nthings that you\u2019ll be so far ahead of\neveryone else. Does that worry you?\nLS At the moment I don\u2019t know \u2013 I don\u2019t\nknow how I\u2019ll be like when I come back\nfromthetrip.I\u2019mhopingtomeetdifferent\npeople who would have done different\nthings. I\u2019m more worried about settling\ndown after spending a lot of time travelling \u2013 hopefully it won\u2019t be too hard.\nDL One thing they\u2019ve mentioned today in Power Shift is motivating peo-ple. How do you think what you\u2019re\nabout to do will motivate people,\nespecially \u2013 in conjunction with the\nconference \u2013 with the awareness for\nclimate change?\nLS People will hopefully hear my story\nand think, \u201cthis girl went on this big trip\nto the Arctic, perhaps I can go on an even\nbigger trip.\u201d Linking that with climate\nchange, it\u2019s all about ordinary people going ahead to do extraordinary things.\nDL This might sound a bit prema-ture, but will you be up for any future\nprojects? Any plans?\nLS Hopefully, after the expedition, I\u2019ll\nhave a feel for expedition life and maybe do similar trips to raise money and\nawareness for combating climate change.\nPossibly something involving trekking to\nthe North Pole? Not a clue at this stage.\nDL I understand that you enjoy filmmaking in your spare time \u2013 tell me\nmore about it?\nLS [Chuckles] I direct, produce, edit,\nscreen-write films and occasionally act.\nI get my friends to act, having to boss\nthem around. I now send in some films to\ncompetitions \u2013 so far I\u2019ve won two out of\ntwo. I\u2019m currently waiting for the result\nfor another.\nDL Thank you for the interview \u2013\nbest of luck with the trip. Maybe you\ncould write an article for me when\nyou return from the trip?\nLS Only if you\u2019d sponsor me.\nDL What for?\nLS I will need to purchase expensive,\nspecialised equipment for the trip, for instance crampons for ice-climbing.\nDL How about if I say to people in\nImperial that, if they want to help\nout, they can do so by contacting\nme through felix.travel@imperial.\nac.uk?\nLS Sounds good.\nDL Now can I have my article?\nLS No.\nLucy in Nepal\n\n"

The\npopulations of the little yeasty creatures multiplies until they have gorged\nthemselves silly on all of the sugar, excreting their waste into the dish as they\ngo.\nUnfortunately for the yeast, their little utopia stops somewhat nastily just\non the brink of a population explosion\n(and no doubt all sorts of yeasty art,\nyour-mum jokes and search for extra-dish-intelligence) because at some\npoint they will either run out of food\nor poison themselves with their own\nwaste products.\nThis is why you have to distil alcoholic drinks to get them up much beyond a few percent.\nA similar situation applies to our-selves. The human species feed on\nan underground source of calories,\nwhich BP, Exxon and the like are only\ntoo happy to sell to us in a million different forms to keep us happy. Transport, heating electricity, clothing,\nmedicine, agriculture and almost all\naspects of our modern civilisation are\ndependent on these cheap fossil fuel\ncalories to keep the economy grow-ing. We burn it, releasing the energy\nof ancient sunlight, and discharge\nthe waste product, CO2, into the\natmosphere.\nLuckily for us, CO2 isn\u2019t toxic in it-self, but it is poisoning the atmospheric\nenergy balance, and disrupting climate\nsystems such as the Asian Monsoon\nthat we rely on to maintain agricultural\nconditions optimal for our food supply.\nWe are also on the brink of an energy\nsupply precipice. The easy-to-get-at oil, on which we rely, is being used\nup. New discoveries of oil peaked in\n1964, and it is likely that supplies will\nstart to decline within the next few\nyears. Population, meanwhile, continues to increase.\nLet\u2019s hope that we have the foresight\nto recognise, accept, and do something\nabout these problems. Unlike yeast.\nEricaThompson:Arehumanssmarterthanyeast?\n\u201cUnfortunately\nfor the yeast, their\nlittle utopia stops\nsomewhat nastily\njust on the brink\nof a population\nexplosion\u201d\nT\nhe Internet has done\nmany things in its brief\nforty years on this planet.\nBut for something whose\nfirst act was to allow scientists to share jokes with each other\nfrom the comfort of their offices, its\ndone surprisingly little for getting people to realise how sad they are.\nLast year I did a little tour of the\nBBC\u2019s online \u201cHave Your Say\u201d website,\nhighlighting the multitude of sand-wichless picnics that spend their days\ntapping away on their keyboards like\nan infinite number of lobotomised\nmonkeys. They\u2019re still funny now, not\nbecause what they\u2019re saying is dumb\n\u2013 although it really is \u2013 but because\nthese people have no idea what they\u2019re\nsaying. It takes a special kind of stupid\nto sit down in front of a system that\nconnects billions of other members\nof their species and not take a quick\nlooky-loo to see if everyone else is as\nhare-brained as they are.\nI only bring this up because last\nweek\u2019s article by the delightful Mariash\nwas one of those articles that makes\nme sit back and wonder whether people ever stop talking for long enough\nfor their brain to finish checking it\nfor sense. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a little civil\nservant sitting up there in their skull,\nwatching a live broadcast of what their\nhuman is saying, frantically trying to\nget through to the press on the mobile\ntelling them not to publish any of it. In\ncase you didn\u2019t read it \u2013 and why would\nyou, we only publish felix to pass the\ntime \u2013 Ms. Mariash\u2019s article bemoaned\nthe state of sexuality at Imperial. And\nthat\u2019s fair enough, because a lot of the\nfirst years do spend their days staggering around in half-on, half-off clothes\nwith a look in their eyes like a walrus\nin heat. Then again, the first years are\nstill teenagers, and you\u2019re at univer-sity. Explain to me which bit of this is\nsurprising.\nAnyway, bizarrely obvious assertions\naside, the bit that really gets me is the\nhyperbole. It\u2019s as if everyone she\u2019s met\nso far at Imperial tried to shag various\nappendages off her within sixty seconds of meeting her, as if her entire\nlife is one of those Japanese hidden-camera gameshows, \u2018Normal Workday\nRapist Surprise\u2019 or something. I mean,\nI know that generalisations are part\nand parcel of writing comment pieces\nbecause I\u2019m as guilty as anyone, but\nlet\u2019s at least make them vaguely rea-sonable. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a bastion\nof romance, standing ironically erect\namong a field of disease-ridden copulating youngsters, a single tear rolling\ndown your cheek and falling onto the\nrose you hold in your hand.\nRomance is no more dead than tee-totalling, helping old ladies across the\nstreet or not reading the Daily Mail.\nJust because fewer people are doing it\nthe way you want it done doesn\u2019t mean\nyou get to forge a soapbox out of unused Valentine\u2019s Day cards and declare\nyourself the last of the Queen\u2019s Tower\nHand-Holding Society.\nI\u2019m really happy that you folk are getting the keyboards dusted off and writing for the comment section, but I\u2019m\nfairly sure I\u2019m not alone in being of the\nopinion that a few of you aren\u2019t tapping\nyour sanity barometers as you walk past\neach morning to check if they\u2019re swinging to \u201cAway With The Electric Boogaloo Fairies\u201d\n. The great thing about free\nspeech is that it\u2019s a right, but not an ob-ligation. You can say anything you want.\nBut you really, really don\u2019t have to. Honestly. So many more things you could be\ndoing. Like getting drunk or having sex\nwith strangers.\nIjest.Idothinkit\u2019skindofsadthatpeople like Mariash still feel the need to declare their virginity, their sensible drink-ing, their desire for true love. Because\nwhat it means is that the people making\nall the noise are the small proportion of\nidiots trying to rut anything with a cavity at crotch height. Thing is, Mariash,\nthe solution to this isn\u2019t for you to write\nin felix how the entire world is conspiring to get you into a sex education class.\nAll that does is make your stance look\nsillier. And then someone\u2019s going to get\ndepressed about how awful my grammar is, go and drink their sorrows away;\nyou\u2019re just feeding the system Mariash.\nYou\u2019re part of the problem. So go and\ntalk to people, find others like you.\nAngryGeekisfartoosexyforthiscolumn\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if everyone\nshe\u2019s met so far\nat Imperial tried\nto shag various\nappendages off\nher within sixty\nseconds \u201d\n\n"

I guess it\u2019s the Vietnamese answer to a French crepe. Just go try it.\nRestaurant Review: Cay Tre worth it\nI\nmagine you\u2019ve been overindulging on fatty and greasy nibbles\nand your body starts to cry out\nfor a good detoxing. Or if the after effects of a big night out on\nthe town start to wreak havoc on your\nstomach and brain. Such times call for\nlight, refreshing, and if at all possible,\nhealthy meals. Few cuisines can truly\nclaim that they fit the bill for this situ-ation, but in my opinion, Vietnamese\nfood is king.\nThe advent of 3 \u2018Pho\u2019 outlets around\nLondon has got people talking about\ncuisine from this former French colo-ny, whose aromatic soup noodles and\nfragrant rolls seem to satisfy many\nLondoners\u2019 cravings for health-con-cious eating. Overall these little eateries aren\u2019t bad, but they don\u2019t quite\nstand up to the more authentic offerings of the \u2018Pho Mile\u2019, an area which\nfor me consists of the eastern end of\nOld St and a good chunk of Kingsland\nRd. This area has been known to food-ies for a while, but I reckon it\u2019s about\ntime it really got put on the map.\nIf you haven\u2019t had Vietnamese food\nin this area before, Cay Tre is a pretty good place to start. I\u2019m not one of\nthose who likes to stand outside and\nwatch the red buses career their way\ndown Old St, so if you\u2019re like me, advance reservation is recommended\nfor dinnertime. As you\u2019d expect from\na restaurant with hoards of expectant\ncustomers outside pondering what delights will fill their bellies, the service\nwas efficient and we were promptly\nguided to our table. Nothing about the\ninterior of this eatery struck me as spe-cial, but the tables were fairly spacious\nand the seats adequately comfortable.\nThe menu was one of the most interesting and varied that I had seen in\nquite some time. It revealed that the\nclassic dishes such as Pho or summer\nrolls were available, but also on of-@ 301 Old St, EC1V 9LA. Yes, I know what you\u2019re thinking, it\u2019s pretty far from Imperial. But well worth the visit.\nfer were eloquently described tummy\nrumbling-inducing regional specialities from both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh\nCity (Saigon).\nMy curiosity directed me to try both\nclassic and regional dishes. I\u2019ll start\nwith our classic beef noodle soup,\na.k.a. Pho. Ok, I lie, it wasn\u2019t exactly\nthe classic version. It was their Hanoi\nversion, which was basically the same\nbut just 50p more. The price increase\ncould be justified by the inclusion of\nextra beef. Overall, I was satisfied,\nbut it didn\u2019t blow me away. The soup\nbase was aromatic and the fresh herbs\nreally added an extra dimension, but\nthat\u2019s what you would expect from\nPho. For me, I felt the soup needed\nan extra depth of rich beef shin taste\nand the noodles could have been a tad\nthinner.\nAt this point, I really couldn\u2019t understand the rave reviews about this\nplace. But this was about to change,\nand fast. \u2018Bun cha ha noi\u2019, a dish comprising of beautifully cooked, tender\npieces of lemongrass infused pork loin,\naccompanied with a wonderfully light\nvermicelli salad, delighted my senses.\nThe temperature contrast of the warm\nmeat with the chilled noodles, brought\ntogether by the refreshing tastes of\nmint and Vietnamese basil, got my\ntastebuds dancing. All for just \u00a36.50. I\nwas now halfway to being happy man.\nBut the fun didn\u2019t stop there, not\nonly because I was excited by the novelty of a regional speciality, but also\nbecause of its sheer brilliance. \u2018Banh\nxeo\u2019, whose rather misleading description of being a Vietnamese pizza,\nturned out to be a true gastronomic\ngem. This Saigon speciality comprised\nof an elegant crispy pancake, folded\nin half and filled with juicy pieces of\nchicken and succulent prawns. The\nbeauty of this dish takes on a new\nform when you place a chunk of the\npancake in a lettuce leaf, top it up with\nfresh herbs and pickle, and dip it in\n\u2018nuoc cham\u2019 (the omnipresent sweet\nand hot Vietnamese dipping sauce).\nUpon placement into your mouth, I\ncan guarantee a merry-go-round of\nsavoury, aniseedy and sweet flavours\nand a serenade of crunchy and soft\ntextures will soon follow. Also sure to\nget your tastebuds talking is \u2018Bun Bo\nhue\u2019, a spicier version of Pho, whose\nfragrant lemongrass and chilli infused\nbroth will please those fans of curry-based soup noodles. I\u2019d recommend\nthat you get this dish with their mor-ish crab cakes.\nWith each of these dishes giving\nmore than adequately sized bowls of\nquality cuisine, this place really hits the\nmark in terms of value. I guess the only\ndownside about my visit to Cay Tre\nwas that I didn\u2019t get to try their house\nspeciality of Cha Ca La Vong, a unique\nfish dish hailing from an appropriately\nnamed restaurant in Hanoi. All the\nmore reason to return.\nFood: 9.0\nValue: 9.0\nService: 7.0\nAmbience: 7.0\nOverall: 8.0/10\nHummingbird Bakery \u2013 a delicious experience not to be missed!\n@ 47 Old Brompton Road South Kensington \u2013 a taste of America literally on your doorstep.\nT\nhere is a little bakery near\nImperial College. It sells\ncakes so delicious just\nwalking past it makes your\nmouth water! I thought it\nwould only be fair to tell you about it so\nthat if you wanted to, you could pop in\nthere yourself for a special treat.\nHummingbird Bakery in South Kensington really can\u2019t be missed as there\nis a picture of a hummingbird on the\nshop front. There is also a long queue\nof people, which tells you just how\npopular it is. The bad thing about this\nis that you do normally have to wait\nat least ten minutes before you get\nserved. Don\u2019t let this put you off \u2013 it is\nwell worth it!\nOn its website the owners describe\ntheir cakes as being freshly-baked and\nonly using the best ingredients, which\nwould explain why as soon as you enter your mouth begins to water. There\nare so many delicious cakes to choose\nfrom that it is incredibly tempting\nto buy more than one. The bakery is\nwell known for its American-inspired\ncupcakes, however there are also many\nother desserts to try. A particular favourite of mine is the red velvet cake.\nThis cake is topped with a scrumptious mixture of whipping cream, mas-carpone and cream cheese and it is so\nrich that one cake is definitely enough!\nSome other favourites of mine include the Brooklyn Blackouts - a chocolate sponge covered in custard, and\nI cannot forget about the New York\nstyle cheesecakes.\nThe cakes they make don\u2019t have any\npreservatives in them, which means\nyou don\u2019t have to worry about harmful chemicals. So if you want to buy\nthese cakes as a present for little children you can do so without worrying\nabout the harm it may be doing them.\nHowever this means that they don\u2019t\nkeep their cakes in stock so if you are\nafter something in particular contact\nthem in advance.\nOne of the bad things about this\nbakery is the price. Like anything in\nSouth Kensington it really isn\u2019t good\nvalue for money. Expect to pay at least\n\u00a32 for a small cake. However you do\nget an absolutely scrumptious cake\nfor your money so it is worth forking\nout the cash \u2013 at least once in a while.\nBecause of how expensive these cakes\nare, I only visit this bakery if it really is\na special occasion, perfect for a birthday treat or even a treat for simply going into university.\nI also tend to find that the staff are\nnot the friendliest, they don\u2019t make\nyou feel like a valued customer. It\nfeels more like you are just another\ncustomer with money to spend \u2013 you\ncan almost see the pound signs flashing in their eyes! However, this can be\nexplained by the sheer business of this\nplace. Whenever I go in they are always\nrushed off their feet and therefore they\ndon\u2019t really have the time to give you\nthe best service.\nOnce you have chosen which cake to\nget you can then decide whether you\nwant to eat in or take your cake away.\nIt is usually a lot more expensive if you\nwant to eat in and therefore I tend to\ntake my cake away as there are so many\nnice places in London. You can sit and\neat your cake and watch people at the\nsame time \u2013 a perfect way to spend\nan afternoon. I make sure I take one\nof their wooden forks with me, which\nI think are really cute. Although this\nmay be because it doesn\u2019t take a lot to\namuse me!\nIf you are really celebrating something special, or want to treat a loved\none to a cake they will not forget, it may\nbe worth taking a peek at their website\nas they can make a cake especially for\nyou. This includes drawing and writing\non your cake and even adding sugar\nflowers, coloured sprinkles and other\ncolourful decorations \u2013 perfect if you\nlike pretty cakes like I do.\n\n"
