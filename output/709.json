    "content": "CLETTERS\nLetters\nDemonstrably\nPromotablc\nDear Sir,\nAnother of your reports ( FELIX19 June)\non the Department of Computing is\nincorrect. It is untrue that academic staff\npromotion in the Department is only\ndependent on research performance. The\nrequirements are the same as throughout the\nCollege.\nGood evidence of a serious and effective\ncommit t ment to teaching is always required\nfor promotion to the senior staff. Other\nfactors also, of course, weigh heavily,\nincluding: a demonstrably successful\ncommit t ment to research or scholarship,\nadministrative service to Department or\nCollege, and special achievement in the\ntransfer to industry of expertise or advances\nin science and technology.\nWhile this Department has major\nresponsibilities to the country by virtue of its\ninternationally pre-eminent research in New\nGeneration Computing, it continues to\nrecognise an over-riding responsibility to its\nundergraduate and postgraduate students.\nYour faithfully,\nB McA Sayers\nHead of the Department of Computing\nDean of the City and Guilds College\nSexist\nMagazine\nDear Sir,\nI am writing to express my opinion about\nthe two photographs of 'strip-o grams' which\nappeared in this week's edition of your\nmagazine and which I found highly offensive.\nI believe that all members of this College\nshould be able to enjoy a lunchtime or\nevening in the Union Bar and to attend\nlectures without having to witness this sort of\nthing. If certain members of the College wish\nto watch women taking their clothes off they\ncan do this in strip clubs, cinemas or in the\nprivacy of their own homes. I was fortunate\nenough not to be present at either of the\nevents but I would have been offended and\nembarrassed if I had been and I am sure that a large number of women(and quite possibly\nmen) at this College feel the same way.\nThe Union Bar ought to exist to cater for\nthe needs of all of our membership. If\nactivities are allowed to take place within it\nwhich offend a number of them, then it is\nfailing to do so. By publishing photographs\nof these events your magazine is not only\nalienating some of its readership, but also\ncondoning the use of College and Union\npremises for such activities. Although you\nstate that your previous comment about\nbanning women from the bar was 'tongue in\ncheek', you Have re declared your sexist\nattitude by unnec essr y republishing the\nphotographs. The inclusion of a picture of a nude male does nothing to redress any\nbalance, even if that was what was needed.\nIf the persons responsible for the events\nand for the articles in question are of the\nmisguided opinion that women exist for the\nt it il ation of men upon payment of money,\nwould they kindly keep it to themselves and\nnot force either it, or its consequence on the\nrest of us.\nYours sincerely\nS Chittenden\nPost Graduate\nElec Eng\nUnmarried\nFreebie Hunter\nDear Sir,\nPoor Nick James! My heart bleeds for him.\nAfter all, he is going to be made homeless\nwhen the unfortunate residents of the\nFremantle Hotel move out, and he can't get\nanother sinecure (sorry-warden ship with free\naccommodation) because he isn't married.\nNick James will have to start paying rent-just\nlike the hundreds of postgraduate students at\nthis establishment who would have leapt at\nthe chance to be warden of the Fremantle\u2014if\nthe post had ever been advertised.\nI am horrified that someone like Mr James\ncan actually Complain about the way College\nappoints student managers and wardens.\nJust look at the facts. He was appointed\nwarden of the Fremantle Hotel without an\ninterview, when his sole contribution to its\nsocial life was keeping the bar open all hours\nfor Michael Arthur. He was given free\naccommodation for several years, during\nwhich he made no impact what s over on the\ndisgusting state of the residence, where\naround a hundred students were forced to\npay above the going rate for damp, under-furnished and squalid surroundings.\nPeople like Nick James ought to be shot,\nthe old-boy network method of appointing\ncandidates ought to be scraped, and then\nperhaps there will be an improvement in\nconditions in some of the worse hell-holes\nCollege thinks are fit for student\naccommodation.\nName and address supplied\nFEUX\nGoodbye Lord Flowers\nWhen Lord Flowers came to Imperial College\ntwelve years ago, he perceived that Imperial was\n'supposed to be good, but not quite as good as it\nshould have been.'\nWhen Sir Peter Swinnerbon\u2014Dyer visited IC\nWith the UGC this year, he said that Imperial is\n'good, but not quite as good as it is supposed to be'.\nIt would be a mistake, though, to assume from\nthis that Flowers has achieved nothing during his\ntime here. He started by righting many of the\nCollege's wrongs, like making Headship of\nDepartment a fixed-term, appointment. He set up\nthe vitally necessary inter-disciplinary centres. He\nsaw the College through a difficult period of its\nhistory in the first round of cuts. And he leaves it in\na good position to deal with the imminent difficult\nperiod.\nIt has been said that the Rectorship of Imperial\nCollege is the single most important job in the\nuniversity system\u2014it is Flowers who has made it\nso.\nHe has, of course made unpopular decisions.\nThe Flowers report on re-organs ation of medical\neducation made him many enemies. But they have\nsince come to accept the logic of it. Some of his\nappointments within the College have, in\nretrospect, seemed wrong.\nBut time, which modifies opinions, will put the\nseal on his reputation. In spite of what has been\nsaid against him, his name will never be mentioned\nat IC without respect, nor without calling to mind a style of administration that is try ly memorable\nWelcome, Professor Ash\nCongratulations to Professor Ash on his\nappointment as Rector of Imperial College. The\nRector of Imperial College has un par all ed opportunities to influence science policy in this\ncountry. However Imperial College has too many\nproblems of it's own for the Rector to concentrate\nexclusively on forming national policy. The Rector\nmust work with his staff at finding solutions to the\nproblems of accommodation, teaching standards,\ngovernment cuts. If College is to continue to be a 'Centre of Excellence' Eric Ash is desc ir bed by his\npostgraduate students as being hard working,\nquick and most importantly interested in students.\nHe certainly seems prepared to listen to students\nproblems and work towards finding solutions.\nThere are no easy answers to College's problems.\nHopefully, though, Professor Ash will be able to\nuse his undoubted talents to, at least, improve on\nthe situation. He certainly seems to have many of\nthe qualities required.\nPG FELIX\nIn recent years there have only been one or two\npostgraduate issues of FELIX.

    "content": "LNEWS FEATURE\nI would go along with one of the themes in the\ngreen paper. What I find immensely\ndepressing is the view that the resources that\nwe are devoting to higher education at the\nmoment can, at best, be kept constant. In\nspite of everything this is an affluent society\nand education has a value quite apart from its\nability to back up industry. I feel that there is\nan enormously strong case for having an\nincrease in the total resources going into the\napplied sciences whilst preserving and\nperhaps enhancing the rest as well.\nF: The green paper criticised four year\ncourses saying that some of the training\nprovided should really come from the\nindustry. Have you any views on four\nyear courses?\nA: I do have a view, but all I can offer you at\npresent is a parochial view. I can tell you what\nwe have recently done in the Department of\nElectrical Engineering at University College.\nWe have started a four year course where\nsome students will obtain a BSc after three\nyears, and some will go on for a fourth year.\nThe decision as to who does what will be\ntaken at the end of the second year, and will\ndepend, first of all, on student preferences,\nand secondly on academic attainment. The\nview that I hold is that there really is a very\nstrong case for four years of study for those\npeople who want to engage in it. I think that if\nwe are going to try and claim that our\nuniversity courses are equivalent to those\nthat you find on the continent, France and\nGermany in particular, we do have to have at\nleast some people taking four year courses. I do not take the view that was advocated in\nthe Finneston Report; that the brig he st people should take four year courses and the\nless able three year courses. I believe that\nthere will be some exceedingly able students\nwho will to leave after three years, perhaps to\ndo research in a university, or to go straight\ninto industry. I think that the people who\nwant to do four year courses will all be able.I don't see it as a simple separation of the\nsheep and the goats.\nF: What do you think about the\ngovernments proposals for two year\ndegree courses?\nA: I really h avn' t had a chance to look at that\nat all. My initial reaction is pretty negative.\nThere are two year degree courses that I have seen in the United States, but they are\nreally intended to be a halfway house on the\nway to a proper degree. There is an intention\nto pack into two years what would otherwise\ngo into three.\nF: The green paper was very critical of\nstudent unions. It criticised them for\nultra-vire s expenditure and failing in\ntheir duty to ensure freedom of s peach. What do you think is the role of student\nunions?\nA: I didn't really participate in Union\nactivities when I was a student, and Iha v n't really had much contact with Union matters\nat University College either, have to confess\nthat engineers on the whole tend to be\napathetic, and don't participate as much as I feel they should. My general views on\nstudent unions is that they should flourish.\nWhen you talk about the freedom of speech,\nare you talking about the issue that has\narisen at other universities of whether unions\nshould give speaking rights to certain\nun favoured politicians?\nF: Yes.\nA: I think that's to be deprecated. I feel that\nany university society has a right to invite\nwhoever they want, and having invited them\nthey should be welcome and listened to; if\nnot with respect, at least with attention.\nF: Students at IC are very concerned\nabout the teaching standards in certain\ndepartments. Will you support the\npresent Rector's drive to improve\nteaching standards?\nA: Obviously I can't comment on teaching\nstandards at IC I can't even comment on\nteaching standards at University College,\nbut I have a passionate interest in teaching\nstandards in my department. It is a fiendishly\ncomplex issue. Promotion in universities has\nbeen traditionally been based primarily on\nre a search and not on teaching. The\narguments in favour of continuing to do this\nare really quite faulty. However there is one\nthing that one has to admit and that is that it\nis quite possibly to judge research\nperformance, whereas it is fiendishly difficult\nto judge teaching performance.\nNevertheless I think it should be attempted.\nI 've had one minor impact on the promotion\nsystem at University College during the time\nthat I was Dean, and that relates to the\ncriteria adopted when promoting to a senior\nlectureship. Very roughly the criterion\nadopted is that for promotion to readership,\ntwo-thirds on one's performance is judged on\nresearch and one-third on teaching and\nother administrative duties. In the case of\npromotion to Senior Lecturer the\nproportions are reversed. I have always\nemphasised that, even for a Reader, you\nshould regard these asses ment s as\nmultiplicative. In other words, if someone\nscores nought for teaching ability, then it\nshould not be possible to promote him or her\nto a Readership; however good they are as a researcher, and vice-versa. However good\none is as a teacher, part of one's life at\nuniversity must involve research, and so\nsome indication that these people have\ncontributed to research also seems essential\".\nOne of the problems in asse sing teaching is\nthat the people who seem to know about it\ntend to be ther person's immediate colle gue s in his or her own department. I feel that one\nought to seek more references from senior\nmembers of a department when promoting\njunior members of that department, in order\nto make a better attempt at assessing\nteaching teaching. This is ending up as a speech but I do feel very strongly about this.\nThere is one more thing that I 've tried in my\nown lectures at times and which is almost\nuniversal in some American universities\nincluding Stanford, and that is where the\nlecturer hands out at the end of the course, a question aire in which the students are asked\nto assess all aspects aspects of that\nparticular course; the subject matter, the\nspeed, the degree of stimulation or boredom\nand so on. I feel that it is a rather good\ndiscipline for everyone to subject themselves\nto, although I would not be in favour of\nutilising this information or making it\navailable to any third parties. I feel that it's a very good feedback mechanism for the\nlecturer himself.\nF: Many departments have already\nadopted similar schemes.\nAnother problem that many students\nfind is that of finding accommodation.\nCollege is considering building a new\nhall. It may use the profits from the sale\nof the gravel at the Harlington sports\nground to pay for it. Do you see this as a solution? Do you see accommodation as\none of your main problems?\nA: Yes absolutely. We regard it as a very\nmajor issue at University College. It must\ncount as one of the key issues for any\na cede mic institut uti on in London. Obviously\nI can't comment at this stage on the\ndisposition of available resources.\nF: The union are very worried about the\nCollege's attitude to overseas students.\nThey believe that the College present an\nunfair view of London when recruiting\nthese students. They also believe that\nthese students are sometimes treated\ndifferently from home students and as a result ghettos are created. What policy\ndo you think the college should adopt\ntowards overseas students?\nA: I think I would like to duck the details of\nthat question because it is very difficult to\ncomment from the outside. I think one of the\ngreat things about the University of London,\nsince its inception, has been that there has\nalways been a high percentage of people\nfrom all parts of the world. I agree that with\nyou that it is highly undesirable that overseas\nstudents feel that they can only talk to each\nother, and do not spread through the\ncommunity. To give you one example, we\nhave five Chinese scholars studying in the\nElectrical Engineering Department here at\nUniversity College. I have made it an\nabsolute rule that they can never share an\noffice together, for this reason.\nF: Another thing is that the Union is\nworried about access by the President of\nIC Union to the Rector. Do you feel that\nthe President is an important person.\nA: I do think that the President is important\nand I do not believe that access to me will be\na problem, provided that people are\nprepared to see me at what might be called\nun social hours.\nF: IC almost regards itself as a university, and often ignores the rest of\nthe University of London. Do you see\nthis changing?\nA: Again, I would prefer to judge that when\nI'm on the spot, but I suppose the fact that\nLord Flowers will now be the Vice\nChancellor of the University might help to\nstrengthen links.\nF: Finally, have you got anything that\nyou are very keen to change at Imperial?\nA: I think that I'm going to duck that one too.\nI think having a. new doctor come in and\nimmediately start prescribing remedies\nwould be a big mistake.\nF: Thank you very much, Professor Ash.\nA: Thank you.\n4 Wednesday 26 June 1985 FELIX\n\n"

College Secretary,\nJohn Smith, intends to consult\nlocal residents so that any\ndevelopment can fit in with their\nwishes.\nPart of the finance for the \u00a34m project may come from gravel\nexcavations at Imperial's Harlington Sports Ground, with\nthe remainder being loan\nfinanced.\nThe plans for the interior\nconsist of a number of alternative\nroom schemes. The most\nluxurious has shower and basin\nen suite, and at the other extreme\nare Southside-style study\nbedrooms.

It is not yet clear whether the\nhall will be used by undergrads or\npost grads, but part of the reason\nfor building a residence to a higher standard than Southside is\nto attract a higher income from\nsummer users.

Ash, at present\nHead of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering\nat University College London, will take up the appointment on 1\nOctober 1985.\nAfter taking a BSc and PhD at\nIC in the early fifties Ash did\nresearch at Stanford and QM C, later becoming a research\nengineer at Standard Telecommunications. In 1963 he\nbecame a lecturer at UCL and\nwas made professor in 1967.\nProfessor Ash turned down the\nopportunity to apply for several\nvice-chancellorship s before\nagreeing to be considered for the\nRectorship of IC because it was\n'most challenging job in\nacademia\u2014at least on the science\nside'.\nIn an interview with FELIX Professor Ash stated he had 'a passionate interest in teaching\nBiotechnology\nExhibition\nAn exhibition of New Technology in Biotechnology is\ncurrently being held by Nature\nmagazine at the Novotel,\nHammersmith.\nExhibits range from ferment-ers to sterilis ers, from incubators\nto automatic liquid handlers.\nOf particular interest are\nApplied Biosystems who have\nmachines on display that can\nsequence proteins automatically,\nand another which synthesis es high-purity, high-yield oli go nucleotides quickly and automatically.\nAnalytical Measuring Systems\nLtd are exhibiting their image\nanalysis equipment.

    "content": "NEWS FEATURE J Professor Eric Arthur Ash was nominated as the new Rector last Friday. In a searching interview with FELIX he discusses his past and hopes for the\nfuture\nFELIX: Could you start by telling us\nsomething of your background, family,\nhome and childhood?\nAsh: I was born in Germany. My family\nemigrated to this country in 1938 when I was\nten years old. I have one sister. My father was\na lawyer. I went to University College School\nand subsequently to a place called Imperial\nCollege, City and Guilds. Since then I have\nacquired one wife and five daughters.\nF: When you were at Imperial were you\ninvolved in the Union? What sort of\nsocial life did you have?\nA: I didn't have very much connection with\nthe Union. I participated in quite a lot of\nactivities. I used to go rowing every weekend.\nSince at that time I only weighed 9\\ stone,\nthe only thing I could usefully do was sculling,\nbut I did that fairly religiously. There wasn't at that time an orchestra at Imperial College\nso I played in the orchestra at University\nCollege instead.\nWhat else did I do those days? Well, we had a fair amount of social life. It seemed to involve\nthe RCM quite a bit. I don't know whether\nthis still goes on or not.\nF:A little.\nA: I think that is something to be\nencouraged.\nF: What musical instrument do you\nactually play?\nA: I play the violin or the viola\u2014but I haven't played very much for the last five years so I am distinctly rusty.\nF: Your CV says that you left IC in 1952\nto go to Stanford. From there you went\nto QMC in 1954 and Standard\nTelecommunications in 1955. Why did\nyou move out of the university sector\nand why did you return to university life\nin 1963?\nA: I moved out of the univerity sector\nbecause I feel that industry is the natural\nhabitat for engineers, or at least it is one that\nthey ought to experience. When I went into\nindustry, I had absolutely no intention of\ncoming back to a university. Like everything\nelse in my life it seems to have happened by\naccident.\nF: What is your research field?\nA: My current field is primarily developing\nnew forms of imaging, in particular ultrasonic imaging using ac cou stic waves and\nthermal wave imaging, and also some new\nways of imaging with light. In the past I have\nspent a lot of my time working on micro-waves, micro-wave tubes and solid state\ndevices in general.\nF: We noticed that you have just\nreceived a major award from the UGC\nfor your research group. Are you\nplanning to bring your group over to\nImperial?\nA: I have talked to my colleagues here and\nmy new colleagues at Imperial about this. I think there really wouldn't be anything to be\nsaid in favour of doing that. The group here is\nwell enmeshed in the infra-structure. I think if\nI were to take out any of my PhD students\nand ask them to move West, they would\nprobably lose something like a year getting\nresettled, so instead I am simply going to\nspend a little bit of time over here. However,\nin the long run I would very much like to start\nsome research at Imperial.\nF: Do you see yourself primarily as an\nadministrator or as an academic\nresearcher?\nA: I don't think there is really any choice\nabout it. I think if one is going to play the role\nof Rector of Imperial College, you are\nprimarily an administrator. But there isn't any reason why one needs to spend one\nhundred percent of one's time doing one\nthing, and so I very much hope that I can\ncontinue to be a part-time academic.\nF: Why did you decide to move out of\nacademic research and into\nadministration?\nA: Getting a letter asking me whether I was\nprepared to be considered for the Rectorship\nof Imperial College. Like everything else in\nmy life, it really wasn't planned. In fact I have\nturned down a number of previous\nopportunities for Vice-Chancellorships\ncheerfully and rapidly. To me Imperial\nCollege was different. First of all, I was there\nin my youth and enjoyed it enormously. It is, I think, the most challenging job in academia -at least on the science side.\nF: Would you agree with the Chairman\nof the UGC Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer's comment that it is the most important\njob in the University sector?\nA: I think it would be very unwise of me to\nstart quarrelling with Sir Peter SwinnertonDyer at this stage.\nF: There is a rumour going round\nCollege that you were offered the\nposition of Head of the Electrical\nEngineering Department. Is there any\ntruth in the rumour and, if so, why did\nyou turn it down?\nA: You mean recently?\nF: Yes.\nA: No, there's absolutely no truth in this.\nMany years ago there was some discussion\nof my moving from here to Imperial College\nto the Electrical Engineering Department,\nbut at that time I really felt I was so enmeshed\nin the research I was doing here that it didn't seem sensible to move.\nF: Do you think you'll have time to\ninvolve yourself in skiing, - music and\nyour other recreations?\nA: I certainly hope to continue to go skiing.\nWhen you get to my age and you stop for a season or so, you'll probably never start\nagain but, unhappily, that never takes up\nmore than about ten days. We've normally\ngone skiing over Christmas. Now we have\njust reached the happy phase of life when we\nno longer have any children, or at least no\nchildren who are subject to school holidays,\nso we might go at other times.\nF: Have you got any views on the UGC\nreport on Imperial, in particular the\ncriticisms of teaching standards?\nA: I have only seen an abstract of this report,\nmaybe in the Times Higher Educational\nSupplement. Obviously I don't have views on\nthis. My knowledge of Imperial College dates\nback about thirty three years. Since then I have only had intermittent contact with a few\nof my colleagues. I obviously don't have an\noverview at all.\nF: How do you think IC has changed\nsince you were an undergraduate here?\nA: I think that in a third of a century a place\nchanges so much that it is hardly worthwhile\ntrying to make the comparison; of course, all\nthe buildings are new and the place must\nhave doubled in size. I suspect that what I remember from my student days won't really\nhelp very much at this stage. I know a bit\nabout it from current contacts. At the\nmoment, for example, I am the external\nexaminer for the applied optics course in the\nPhysics Department.\nF: What are your views on the present\ngovernment's policies on higher\neducation and on the recent green paper\nin particular?\nA: Well I have of course read the green\npaper, but not with any great enthusiasm. I do have to say that I believe we have no\nalternative but to redirect our resources\ntowards the applied sciences. To that extent,\nContinued overleaf.\nFELIX Wednesday 26 June 1985 3\n\n"
