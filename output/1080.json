Ian Caldwell, IC's Director of Estates, explained: \"No-one anticipated how much noise the\nwork would transmit to the residences above. So, we decided to stop\nwork until after the exams\".\nSince October a variety of problems, including the air conditioning\nsystem, have further prevented the\nbuilding from opening. Chris Cooke,\nPHOTO: ALDOUS\nPractice Manager at the centre, said\nof the delays \"Constuction difficulties covers a multitude of sins\".\nThe existing health centre in\nPrinces Gardens fails to meet regulations governing disabled access.\nCurrently, in order to see the dentist\nor nurse patients must negotiate\nstairs. The new centre has will have\nlifts to all levels.\nThe finishing touches are being\nput to the building at the moment.\nThe staff are expected to move in\nduring 21-24th March. Mr Cooke\nhas said \"We can't waif'.This new\nsite will be the permanent home of\nthe health centre and although it has\na larger capacity there will be no new\nstaff employed.\nNews in Brief\nWHERE WILL YOU\nBE LIVING IN\n1997/98?\nYOUR ACCOMMODATION QUESTIONS\nWhere to live Contracts Where to look Who to live with Deposits Inventories Paying the rent ANSWERED!\nA talk given by ULAO staff in association with the\nTUESDAY4 TH MARCH5.30 P.M.

J M1\"';' Dr Eastwood, Director of\nPlanning and Information\nManagement Services. Hmm,\nsounds important. What is it?\nWell, Planning and Management Information\nServices is a new part of university administration,\nresponsible for liaison with funding charities and\nthe Higher Education Funding Council for\nEngland, HEFCE, and therefore for roughly 50\nmillion pounds worth of grant that we get every\nyear, and making sure that we maximise it. I am\nalso in charge of running the resource allocations\nplanning round, where each department is asked to\nsupply their financial and resource requirements\nfor the coming year. This is also a way of managing student numbers, because wc are limited there.\nI should also mention the management information\nside, which is concerned with running the main\nadministrative computer systems: finance, payroll,\nregistry. We are also responsible for providing\ninformation at a high level for departments. We are\ndeveloping a system whereby you could look at all\nthe information held on a student from all the\nadministrative departments or all the details about\na particular department, group or even sub-group.\nFor example, where their funding comes from,\nwhether charities or research councils or industry,\nor the nationality of students and who pays their\nfees. Any student could see what we hold on them,\nthough it would be fairly boring.\nHow would you say that your job impacted on\nstudents?\nWell, I'm not involved with any of the students\non a personal level, sadly, though I enjoy meeting\nstudents. I tend to get involved on populations of\nstudents, and the number of students in each\ndepartment and the relationship between undergraduates and postgraduates.\nHow long have you been at IC in your current\nposition?\nI joined the College nine years ago, and became\nplanning and information in August when I took\non the information side.\nWhat was your first job, how much were you\npaid and how long did you hold it?\nMy first ever job was computer programmer at\nthe Natural History Museum. I 've been in SW7 for\nall my working life. I remember exactly how much\nI was paid, it was all the twos, \u00a32,222.1 was at the\nNatural History Museum for thirteen years in various jobs. I ended up as assistant to the director of\nthe museum. This was at the time when they first\nintroduced admission charges. We can trace your\nhand in that can we? Yes, though I was fairly\njunior and wasn'ta prime mover, but I was responsible for writing it down, trying to make it look as\nattractive as possible in the short term.\nYou must have seen some significant changes\non the SW7 site during your time, could you\nyourself describe some?\nThe greatest ones are still to come! Apart from\nall that going on out there [gestures at BMS site]\nthe museums have development plans, and the\nAlbert Hall has its Millennium redevelopment plan\nand the V&A have got its boiler house or whatever it's called now. It will be a bit of a building site\nuntil the millennium, and of course the Albert\nMemorial will lose its plastic coat. But going back,\nthe most significant thing that I can recall happened just before I got here when the Natural\nplease\nstep\nforward...\nHistory Museum had a face lift. It was filthy dirty\nand you couldn't see the facade and now you can\nsee this wonderful Waterhouse building with animals running up the columns.\nBuilding work aside, what image does the present College environment give you?\nI was involved in raising the money for that [the\nBMS building], so its nice to see it going ahead.\nHowever, the campus is not the most inspiring of\nplaces, though one would hope that people would\nbe coming here because of the standard of its edu-cation, not its architecture. The walkway is really\ngrim, grim and windy. The whole design of the\nplace is actually flawed, east-west orientated buildings like the Sherfield building suffer from being a solar trap. If you are on the south side you fry in\nsummer and freeze in winter, it hopeless. You get\na huge solar gradient across the building which\nmeans that the north side and the walkway are\nfreezing and generate a huge wind, the chill factor\nmust be quite high.\nDo you foresee any other mergers or acquisitions? Not in the immediate future. I mean one of the\nremaining independent medical institutions might,\nthat is the Institute of Cancer Research, but they\ndon't wish to at the moment, and we're not push\ning them on it. However, we do now have a grade\nfive History department, so we are therefore a normal university. A few years ago we did have some\ndiscussions on the subject of expanding, and\nbefore my time we were having discussions with\nRoyal Holloway, but it didn't come to anything. A couple of years ago there was talk of Imperial\nwithdrawing from the University of London\nand awarding our own degrees, what has come\nof this? You know we are having a new charter\nbecause of the medical mergers - the old one can't cope and that will give us the power to award our\nown degrees. We have no intention to at the\nmoment, but the last charter lasted ninety years,\nwho knows what's going to happen in nine years\ntime let alone ninety years time? It is, if you look\nat it, rather ludicrous that the University of\nWestminster can award its own degrees but\nImperial College, an institution of world-wide\nstanding, cannot.\nWhere were you born and brought up?\nWell, I was born in Croydon, south London,\nthen in Surrey, and I lived there until I went to uni-vers it y, when I was 18. So would you class yourself as a 'Londoner' perhaps? I suppose so,\nthough for seven years I lived in Newcastle where\nI went to university, and enjoyed it very much.\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\nI play music. Keyboard and Organ, cello at\nschool and the viol which is a form of violin, and I sing.\nCould you describe an anecdote typical of\nyou time as a student.\nIt's not very typical, but when I was on a marine\nbiology field course, (I study zoology at universi-ty), on the North Sea in March. The engine of the\nboat I was in stopped, and I was quite unwell for\nsome time. The educational content of that particular field course was lost on me, and plenty of my\ncolleagues I might add. My future field trips took\nin the beach side of things.\nWere you involved in any student clubs or soci-e ties? I was secretary of the biology club, and a lot of\nmusic, choir and so on.\nSuccinctly as possible, how would you describe\ntoday's students?\nUrn.. The ones at Imperial College are very\ninteresting, and make a valuable contribution to the\nlife of the College and will go on to make a very\nbig contribution to society in general.\nWords and pictures by Alex\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY SPORT 15\nTHE LATEST SCORE\nFrom Felix's sports pundit Dave Robinson.\nOK I got my prediction wrong, but\nthings aren't that bad, so did everyone else. Virtually every programme\non air has gone through the motions\nof dredging up all the usual ideas -the fact is that Glenn Hoddle's England were not good enough for\nItaly on the night. We're not talking\na Taylor scale disaster, just a fluke\nresult, things are still moving for-ward, not rapidly declining as they\nwere in 1993.\nIt was pretty amusing to hear the\nsupposed experts blaming everything from influence of foreign players in our game to the amount of\nmoney amassed by our top clubs.\nWhat exactly are these supposed\npundits talking about ? When Man\nUtd leaked 14 goals in three games\nno one fundamentally questioned\nAlex Ferguson's youth policy or\nwrote off Peter Schmeical as a poor\nkeeper. Yet when England are pretty\nunlucky against one of the world's best sides at Wembley the entire\nteam are cast off. If you believed the\nmore outrageous sports writers Le\nTissier wouldn't get another game\nfor Southampton and Ian Walker and\nSol Campbell would be dropped for\neternity. I said last week that\nFerdinand, Merson and Martyn\nshould be in the side and I stand by\nwhat I said, but I don't pretend that I could do a better job than Hoddle.\nThe fact is that Shearer struggled\nagainst his young marker and it was\nLe Tissier who got the space and\nconsequently the chances. Campbell\nwas always going to struggle in that\ndefence and Pearce was marking\nZola when the pass was made.\nA certain Howard Wilkinson, the\nFA's Technical Director was heard\nto say that young players aren't getting the chance. Has this blok e been\nlocked in his office since cocking up\nLeeds ? The present sides fielded by\nteams such as Man Utd, Liverpool,\nSpurs, Chelsea, Leicester,\nWimbledon and even Arsenal contain exciting new talent. The exceptions to the rule are probably\nNewcastle and Middlesborough, but\neven at those clubs Darren\nHuckerby and Phil Stamp have\ncaught the eye.\nThe growing gap between the perceived rich and poor was also regurgitated, surely the consistently good\nperformances against richer teams\nby Wimbledon, Chesterfield,\nStockport, Wrexham and\nPortsmouth suggest that the gap is\nonly financial and that many of the\nsmaller teams are better organised\nand play with more spirit. The examples of Millwall, Bournemouth,\nBrighton and other cash struck clubs\nare all very well, but that is due to\nbad management rather than uneven\ndistribution of wealth. Small clubs\ncan survive in the big time,\nWimbledon in the Premier, Grimsby\nin the First (just) and sides run on a shoestring like Doncaster and\nScarborough in the third prove that.\nMike Atherton pulled off his usual\ntrick of putting in a world class performance in the last test of the winter\nto survive into the early stage of the\nsummer, on the field for over four l days solidly playing two near faultless innings. His ability to pull off|\nescapes that Houdini would be proud\nof is near legendary, his 140 not out\nto save the test in South Africa last\nyear confirmed his status as the\nworld's most stubborn batsman on\nhis day. He has now developed a knack of catapulting himself up the\nrankings in time for the summer\nhome tests. The only other England\nplayer who really contributed was\nRobert Croft who was only thirty\nruns short with the bat of the cumulative total made by the other five\nmembers of Engand's elite batting\nclub in the first innings. The considerable ease with which a teenager\nwas able to polish off England's attack in both innings can only have\ndismayed the captain.\nMaashaallah for the Arabian knights\nThe long-awaited OSC five-a side\nfootball tournament was won by the\nArabic team in a thrilling final\nagainst the Hellenic team which they\nwon five-one. A full report next\nweek in our bumper sports issue.\nWatch out, watch out, gunmen about\nThe Courtman Shield match has\nbeen moved to the eigth of March to\nallow the City and Guilds dream\nteam to shoot for Great Britain, so\nyou have put your name down for\nthis make a note in your diary. The\nnext match is this Saturday at Bisley\nfor the BUSF pistol championships\nso g it to the sports centre early if you\nare in one of the teams. More clay\npigeon shooting will take place\naround Easter and everyone (even\nnon-members) are welcome. See the\nnotices in the range when they go up.\nRomeos, Romeos, wherefore\nart thou Romeos?\nAlthough the fourth's unbeaten run\nhad seemed to last as long as the\nHundred Years War it was inevitable\nthat it would end. Halley's comet\nmay only come round every eighty-one years but we shall return to conquer again as soon as Saturday in our\nnext league match.\nOn the day after Valentine's day\nthe cards were on the table for IC\neven before the kick-off. Missing six\nfirst team regulars [off swan ning about with their girlfriends, the ran-dom s Sports Eds] and playing\nagainst fellow promotion contenders\nwe were always going to struggle.\nAfter taking an early lead through\nLee, making his senior debut, IC\nwere forced to weather a barrage of\npressure. Queen Mary's twice hit the\nwoodwork in the same attack before\ntheir equalise r, then the controversial\nwinner was scored. With the refer-ee's line of sight blocked the striker\nused his arm to control a bouncing\nball and drilled it past the 'keeper.\nIn the second half we huffed and\npuffed but couldn't blow the Mary's defence down. Thanks to new boys\nAndy, Andy, Ivan, John and Lee.\nIC tennis aced wholeheartedly\nAlthough a disappointment, on paper\nit seemed inevitable for the men's and ladies' teams. Nottingham are\nthe number two seeds in the country\nafter Loughborough. IC tennis team\nusually enjoys good success in the\nBUSA. the men's team has reached\nthe quarter-finals in '93, '94 and '96.\nThe record of the ladies' team is not\nso illustrious, as this is the first time\nin years the we have had one. Under\nthe excellent captaincy of Caroling\nWood, they have made a good start\nto the year.\nThe team was well prepared. Over\nthe Christmas hol s, IC had been\ntraining with the Warsaw University\nteam at Queen's Club and Westway\nsports centre - the return match after\nlast year'sun forget able tour to\nPoland.\nTeam members for the ladies were\nAlesia, Caroline Wood, Kathy Shair\nand Dalia Fontes. For the men\nFlorian Reinaud, Paraag Dave, Dan\nGleich and Stuart Riley.

    "content": "FF.I. TX FRIDAY21 ST FEBRUARY SABBATICAL MANIFESTOS 9\nDP (Finance & Services) Rob Clark\nDuring my four years at Imperial I have noticed that\nthere has been a steady decline in the numbers of\nstudents taking full advantage of all the available\nfacilities offered by Imperial College Union. Many\nstudents automatically assume the Union will\nalways be there to finance the clubs they join, and\nprovide the services that they take for granted. The\nrecent loss of the Union Book Store to Waterstones\nshows how quickly a Union trading outlet can be\nsuddenly replaced, overturning many years hard\nwork by staff and students committed to ensuring\nthat the best possible service and widest range of\nstock are provided. I intend to stop this trend by\nstrengthening the Union's trading position within\nCollege. Increasing awareness of exactly what the\nUnion has to offer students, so that every member\nunderstands the need for a strong and financially\nindependent Union is also a high priority.\nThe experience I have gained while running IC\nDP (Finance & Service)\nOver the past few days a number of people have\nasked me why do I want to do this job. Some have\nsaid I must be mad, for not wanting to take a well\npaid job immediately on graduation. I think it's more a case of ensuring that future students have the\nsame opportunities that were open to me during my\ntime here.\nUniversity is not just about doing a degree, it's also about enjoying yourself and making the most\nof the facilities and services you have on offer,\nfunded by the Union.\nI feel we need to make more students aware of the\nfacilities run by their Student's Union, for them. It's not just the fact that they exist, but we need to\nensure that they really are top quality. In 1998 students from St Mary's and Charring Cross medical\nschools will be studying on the South Kensington\ncampus. This means that there will be an increase in\nthe number of students using the facilities. The next\nDP (Finance & Service)\ntwelve months needs to be used to ensure that\nenough services exist to cope with the extra num-be rs. Anyone who was present in the Union when\nEngland played Italy last week will know how\npacked the place was. We cannot afford to sit back\nand hope it all just happens.\nOf course there are societies that already exist on\nboth campuses, funded by the respective unions.\nWe need to ensure that when, and if, societies\nmerge, that the same level of funding is available. It\nwould be a tragedy if funding was to be cut on the\nbasis that two societies doing similar activities is\ntantamount to duplication of services. I'm not saying that I'm against progress, more saying that we\nneed to be careful over the next few years that we\ndon'tX::/|:/ This year has been a difficult year for ICU, the low\npoint being losing the Bookstore bid. This is now\ngone, but we need to pick ourselves up, and capital is e on the assets that we do run. The bookstore\n13 premises are still under our control, and I believe\n1 H that using that space effectively is key to the\n1 Union's success in the future.\nThis year has seen a small working party (which\nI was part of) prepare long term plans for the shape\nof the Union Building in Beit Quad. I think it is vital\nthat these proposals are carried forward next year,\nJ and we begin to implement them in preparation for\nthe influx of new students following the arrival of\nthe Medics on campus. This is an excellent oppor111tunity for ICU to start a physical and ideological\n1 rebuild.\nThroughout the merger, communication between\nICU, the Medics and college will be of primary\nimportance, but I believe that at the present it is the\nRadio and being a member of Union Finance\nCommittee, Publications Board and House\nCommittee, puts me in a strong position to understand the Union finances. During the course of my\ndegree I have also worked for an industrial research\nlab preparing laboratory test rigs and assisting in the\ntendering process for contracts. Additionally in the\nfive months before Christmas of this year I was\nworking as part of a scientific sales team with\nresponsibilities for technical support, forecasting,\nmarket research and various other aspects of customer support and sales. I believe that over the last\n4 years I have gained the experience to do the job of\nDeputy President (Finance and Services) well and I hope I will receive your support.\nJohn Savery\nDuncan Tindall\ncommunication with the bulk of Student population\nthat lets ICU down.

If elected I would ensure that there was sufficient resources for\nclubs and societies to plan events, with records of\nprevious event budgets, easy to understand guides\nto finances, and personal support readily accessible\nto all.\nWhilst at IC I have been heavily involved with\nCCUs, have sat on Council for the past 2 years,\nICU Exec, for the past year, and am this years ICU\nTransport Officer. This has given me a chance to\nlearn how the finances of the Union work from several different perspectives, and in my opinion, more\nimportantly an understanding of where problems\nand difficulties occur.\nHustings are Tuesday 25th February in dB's and Wednesday 26th in St Mary's Voting takes place in all departments on 3rd and 4th March\n\n"

    "content": "6 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY\nPepsi canned after Burma protest\nPAUL SQUIRES\nUS snack giant Pepsi intends to withdraw completely from the Union of\nMyanmar (Burma) by 31st May,\naccording to a statement issued by\nOliver Wheeler, Pepsico'sUK Head\nof Public Affairs.\nIn November last year, Third\nWorld First and several other student\norganisations in Europe and America\ninformed Pepsi that they were considering instructing their members to\nboycott Pepsi's soft drinks. They\nwere followed this year by the\nNational Union of Students and\nULU.\nThe student organisations cited\nPepsi's continued presence in\nBurma, all edged ly selling Cola in\ncollaboration with the country's oppressive ruling junta, the State\nLaw and Order Restoration Council.\nLast month, Pepsi relented and\nannounced its intention to discontinue all operations in Burma. Although\nmany of the student organisations\nsupporting the boycott claimed a vic-tory, Mr Wheeler was quick to refute\ntheir claims that Pepsi's decision was\na result of their action. Speaking to\nFelix, Mr Wheeler went on to claim\nthat the reasons behind the withdrawal could not be so easily expressed.\nPepsi's involvement with Burma\nbegan early this decade, when Aung\nSun Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's National League for Democracy,\nappealed to foreign companies to\ninvest in Burmese industry, believing\nthat SLORC would soon restore the\ndemocratic constitution, suspended\nin 1988.\nPepsi was among those companies\nwhich responded to the call. To\nensure effective distribution of its\nproduct in the long term, Pepsi must\nsecure a great deal of investment in a country's infrastructure and industry.\nEssentially, all Pepsi soft drinks\nare produced at a single site in the\nUnited States, from where they are\ntransported in concentrate form to\nthe country of destination. There, the\nconcentrates are diluted, carbonated\nbottled and labelled. This process is\nalways carried out by a local firm,\nSLORC and the Prime Minister,\nGeneral Than Shwe.\nAccording to Mr Wheeler, Pepsi\nmade every effort to disengage its\ndistribution network from the SouthEast Asian state, but were bound by a long-term contract with a Burmese\nbottling firm. To breach this contract\nwould in turn be against international law.\n^Wl^M^\"^\"^^ WSJ\nPepsi: Squashed, by students.\noperating under an extended licencing agreement with Pepsi.\nThis method of distribution was\nadopted in Burma, and, in accordance with Suu Kyi's wishes, Pepsi\nwas permitted to hold assets,\nemployees and investments in\nBurma's usually closed regime.\nHowever, as the chance to restore\ndemocracy in Burma faded, The former leader appealed to international\ncompanies with assets in Burma to\nwithdraw their investments, seeing\nthis as a way of exerting pressure on\nIn order to break the agreement,\nPepsi needed US foreign policy\ntowards Burma to permit, or at least\nappear to permit, the premature severance of contracts between US and\nBurmese companies. At the time of\nSuu Kyi's appeal, such a change in\npolicy seemed unlikely.\nAs a result, Mr Wheeler claims,\nPepsi tried to withdraw everything it\ncould without actually breaking the\ncontract. This included all invest-ment s, assets and employees. After\nApril last year, shipments of cola\nconcentrate remained the only form\nof trade between the two firms.\nDespite these developments, in\nNovember Mr Wheeler received a communication from a number of\nstudent organisations threatening to\nboycott Pepsi and its products. Many\nof these threatened boycotts came\ninto effect at the beginning of the\nyear. In January, Pepsi re-examined\nUS policy towards Burma and interpreted it to permit a breach of contract with the bottling firm. On\nJanuary 15th, Mr Wheeler issued the\nfollowing statement:\n\"Based on our assessment of the\nspirit of current US foreign policy we\nare completing our total disengagement from the Burmese market.\nAccordingly we have severed all\nrelationships with our former franchise bottle r, effective May 31st. The bottle r in Burma is taking appropriate steps to ensure that all production and distribution of our products\nare ceased by May 31st1997.\" Whilst cons is it ent ly denying that\nthe disengagement came as a result\nof the boycotts, Mr Wheeler conceded that they may well have played a part in Pepsi's decision. The larger,\nfederal student's unions such as UL U and the NUS constitute powerful\nbuying groups and major consumers\nof Pepsi products. Last week, representatives of the University of\nLondon Union celebrated Pepsi's climb down, and made a show of\ndrinking Pepsi products at a General\nUnion Council meeting. Although\nthey remain bullish, some of the\nUL U executive admitted that their\nown protest actions may have been\novershadowed by threats from influential American Universities, including Harvard.\nTEL M PEH Get involved in your Union's own student TV station!\n1 THE STUDENT TELEVISION\nOF IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nInvites you to a FREE buffet Learn about camera work, vision mixing, editing,\ndirecting, presenting, lighting, script writing, transmitting,\n11 special effects, location filming... anything to do with TV.\nNo previous experience preferred!\n1:00 pm Wednesday 26th February\nSTOIC studio, 3rd floor & left, Union building\n\n"

    "content": "12 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY\nI wasn't going to mention IC at all\nthis week, preferring a side-swipe at\nEurope, but a few things cannot go\nun remarked. It was nice to see that\nmy long-time sparring partner Ian\nCaldwell got his name in print (mind\nyou, I 've been helping there for\nyears). I was delighted to hear that he\nis \"quite interested in the design of\nbuildings and how they used their\nspace and dimensions.\" May I suggest a little less time in the Tate and\na bit more in the BMS, along with\nyour colleagues from Mary's. Lots of\nspace, not many uses. Speaking of\nbuildings, my position on the Library\nclosure has changed from indifference to anger. The first time in 12\nmonths that I need to photocopy\nsomething there, and it's closed.\nThough we all should have known\nthat the no closure policy was as likely as the SCR getting three Michelin\nstars, it is a shambles. I have tracked\ndown Schal's fees to about \u00a33million. Nice to know we've bought in\nreal expertise.\nAs the European supply of spanners\nis gradually thrown into the EMU machine, it looks like one or two\nSimon Baker have really hit the\ntarget. It appears that\nGermany will not\nmeet the Maastricht cri\nteri a on debt and\ndeficit. This is\nbecause its\nattempts to cut\nthe deficit are\nthrowing people on the dole\nlike nobody's business, pushing up\nsocial security,\nreducing the\ntax receipts,\nincreasing debt\nand, you've\nguessed it, the\ndeficit. Welcome to\nMickey Mouse eco nom ics, or as we are supposed to call it the \\ Z0} C6()f 'social model'. This\nis the example that people say Britain\nshould follow.\nFortunately, we aren't. As our\nunemployment falls, theirs rises. Our\neconomy is growing, theirs is stag-na ting. German companies are\ninvesting heavily in\nBritain and even\ntransferring here on\naccount of the inflexible\nworkforce and crippling employer\ncosts in their\nnative country.\nOur economy,\ndescribed as\nthe post-Thatcherite,\npostER M enterprise economy, is\noften labelled a sweat shop\neconomy. We\npay appa ling wages to be com-petit ive. All the new\njobs created in the last\nfive years aren'tReason proper fu ii time positions but low-skill, part-time work. Not the case,\nI'm glad to say. The percentage of\nthe workforce in temporary employment is lower here than in either\nFrance, Germany or Spain. Average\ntake home pay here is significantly\nhigher here than in France or Spain\nand only \u00a3800 per year less than\nGermany. The reason is that taxes are\nsignificantly higher on the continent\nthan here. Britain has been universally praised for the steps taken to restructure our economy in the 80s. The rest of Europe has yet to do this,\nand seems more concerned with\nplaying politics with people's livelihoods in the name of federalism. We\nare best to avoid this like the plague.\nLet me say however, that before I give the government all the credit for\nthis, it must be remembered that our\nrecent economic success stems from\nthe failure of our previous policy,\nnamely membership of the ERM. Still, there is nothing wrong with\nserendipitous discoveries. And if it\nain't broke, don't fix it.\nOh and by the way, I read in IC\nDistorter that there are two Crownappointed places on the Governing\nBody up for grabs, for which nominations are invited from staff and stu-dents. Lord Vincent, I know that you\nare an avid reader of my humble\nprose, and would like to say that I have space in my diary...\nWestminster Eye Hamish Common \"Red tape\n1: makes poor\nswaddling\" was the rather\npicturesque\ni description^ Tuesday's Times leader\ngave to the\nproblems couples face in\nadopting children. This followed a Government announcement that couples refused the chance to adopt a child will be able to appeal. Couples\nwill be able to see the assessment\nreport that led to their not being\nallowed to adopt, and the make-up of\nthe panel who decides will allow for\nmore 'lay' members, including\nsomeone who adopted or was adopt-ed. People will only be allowed to\nremain on the adoption panel for up\nto six years, to prevent 'professional'\npanel members from controlling the\nsystem.\nThese new measures were sparked\noff by a number of well-publicised\ncases where couples were refused the\nchance to adopt children for ostensibly politically correct reasons: the\nmost famous case was of Jim and\nRoma Lawrence, who were told they\nwere not allowed to adopt a mixed-race child because of their apparent\nlack of understanding of racial\nissues, despite Mrs Lawrence being\nborn to an Asian family in Guyana.\nStephen Dorrell, the Health\nSecretary, in announcing the plans,\nsaid \"decisions about which parents\nare able to adopt children should\nreflect common-sense values that are\nwidely shared throughout society,\nand shouldn't reflect the rather specialist and fashionable theories of a particular professional group [ie\nsocial workers]\".\nAlthough I know certain ministers\nenjoy every opportunity they have to\nstick the knife into social workers\nand political correctness, and that\nDorrell is getting a say in any issue\nhe can (he's going for the party lead-er ship), I have to agree with what the\nGovernment is doing. So does the\nBritish Association for Adoption and\nFostering (BAAF) who said that\n\"anything that makes adoption more\nopen and accountable would be welcomed...\". The BAA F also defended\nsocial workers, arguing that they act\nin the best interests of the child and it\nis natural that parents may feel\naggrieved in being refused the\nchance to adopt, but that the child\nhad to come first. I expect the majority of social workers are making a reasonable effort at a tortuously difficult job, and the moronic criteria\nsome of their peers have been using\nhas received the negative publicity\nthat tars them all with the same\nbrush.\nThese new regulations have precipitated debate on the wider adoption issues: did you know only 400\nchildren were formally adopted last\nyear? Yet there are 55000 children in\ncare - and their fate is not something\nwe can be proud of - three-quarters\nof them leave with no qualifications\nand many end up in prison. There are\nplenty of couples wishing to adopt,\nwith 20 applying for each child\nSurely if even some of these were to\nadopt, the potential for giving thousands of children a better start in life\nsaving vast quantities of public\nmoney and making everyone happier\nall round would be enormous\nHowever, I am informed by those\nwho know better that many of these\nchildren are 'damaged' and therefore\nneed expensive treatment and highly\nskilled social workers to nurture\nthem. John Major's belief \"that it is\nimportant for children to be brought\nup in the stability of a home rather\nthan being institutional is ed in children's homes or drifting between\nfoster families\" was described as\n\"devastating ly banal\" by an\nIndependent columnist.\nPersonally, if I was given the\nchoice between institution and\nadopted home, it wouldn't be a diff i cult one.\nThe Weekly Poem It is the stories that we tell ourselves that are to blame\nThe future-maps, the hopes and\nexpectations\nThat are essential for the our ney on\nFor if a story mocks reality, the map\nis incorrect\nOur chosen path is treacherous,\nbecomes a sheer cliff\nThen darkness falls and we are lost\nAnd since reality is fixed\nThough we cling on, the story must\nbe changed\nBut first we need to route the culprit\nout\nBefore we can replace and amend\nYet here our mind, with many devious trick\nHides our precious dream and keeps\nus blind\nBut rescue comes externally\nPassing remarks that seem incongruous at first\nAre signposts to the paths that lead\nastray:\nSlowly our ey s are opened so that\nwe may write\nNew stories.

The meeting was then thrown open\nto discussion. The small audience of\naround 25 students, nearly all of\nwhom were Union Officers, were\nencouraged to voice their opinions.\nSir Ronald, acting as impromptu\nchairman, agreed with one suggestion that there might be too many\nnew courses and Colleges in the UK,\nadmitting \"I think that some parts of\nthe current system are very hard to\njustify.\"\nOne audience member asked the\nrepresentatives of the committee\nwhether they believed that, if students were asked to pay for their edu-cation, equality of opportunity could\nbe maintained. Simon Wright pointed out that the current means of funding is already fundamentally unfair.\nBright candidates from lower-income families are dissuaded from\nattending due to financial pressures,\nwhile less able students from wealthier families can receive an education\nsub sidi sed by taxes from poorer par-ents. Sir Ronald added that scholarships could return to address the bal-ance, enabling students from poorer\nfamilies to study at prestigious institutions. After a brief show of hands, it was\nPHOTO: ROBIN\nFunding dilemma. Simon Wright, the Dearing Committee's student rep,\nponders the fate of his comrades.\nquickly established that all those students present had been forced to take\nout a student loan. Medical students\nin particular suffer from high levels\nof debt. The Rector conceded that in\nAmerica the pressing need to pay off\nlarge loans had seen a drift towards\nsafe, lucrative subjects such as business and law. However, studies show\nthat students still stand to gain significantly, through higher wages, from\ntheir higher education, and so should\nexpect to shoulder some of the bur-den.\nIn response, some students\nclaimed that the prospect of a more\nhighly-paid job rarely figured in the\ndecision of sixth-former s to study at\nuniversity. They also expressed their\ndissatisfaction with the current loans\nsystem, and that they \"...didn't know\nwho would be running it in five years\ntime.\" Piers Williams, ICU Deputy\nPresident for Finance and Services,\naccused the Inquiry of being 'pro-debt.'\nTo the dismay of many in the audi-en ce, Sir William did not pose the\ncrucial question; whether students\nwould prefer larger loans or a graduate tax, until the end of the discus-sion. The general consensus was that\na higher rate of income tax for graduates would be less painful for current students, and have fewer detrimental effects upon the number and\nsubject choice of new candidates.\nA graduate tax, however, fails to\naddress a number of issues; it does\nnot solve the problem of different\ninstitutions needing to charge their\nstudents more than others, and, as Sir\nEric Ash pointed out, it is not always\npossible to define who is or is not a graduate.\nPerhaps most crucially, a graduate\ntax cannot begin to raise large\namounts of money until today's graduates constitute a significant\nfraction of the workforce. This may\nbe several decades away, while the\ncurrent expansion in HE requires\nimmediate funding. The only solution may be to increase loans in the\nshort term, and introduce 'top-up\nloans' for those students whose parent institutions decide to introduce\ntop-up fees. At the same time, a graduate tax should be slowly phased in,\nwith different subjects and Colleges\nattracting different rates.\nThe Dearing Inquiry on HE funding policy is not due to report its findings until after the election.\niCU Overseas Students Committee\nPre .Ln'. s....

Bats!\nElec Eng realises true potential\nWILLIAM LORENZ\nLast week, Imperial College's Electrical Engineering Department\nscored 24/24 in an HEFCE teaching\nquality assessment. Only one other\nEE department in the country has\never equalled this, the highest score\never achieved by any department at\nIC.\nA team of assessors studied all the\ndepartments' teaching activities at\nboth undergraduate and postgraduate\nlevel over a period of three days.\nThey sat in on lectures and discussed\naspects of the course with both lecturers and students.\nSpeaking to Felix, Dr J. Cozens,\nhead of undergraduate teaching\nexplained: \"The assessors had a broad and detailed look at the depart-ment. They told us they had tried to\nget the students to criticise the\ndepartment but had failed. This result\nwill increase people's estimation of\nPHOTO: WILLIAM\n(From left to right) Professor R Spence, Dr J Cozens and Dr Cheung\ncelebrate the perfect score\nthe quality of our degrees.\"\nThe HEFCE assessments are a relative innovation, having been introduced only two years ago. The assessors have not yet been able to visit\nevery UK University department. At\nthe time of going to press, Only the\nfollowing Imperial College departments have been assessed: Electrical\nEngineering (24 points), 1SET(23 points), Chemical Engineering (22\npoints), and Civil Engineering with\n21 points. Reassessment takes place\napproximately once every five years.\nDuring the HEFCE exercise, each\ndepartment is assessed against its\nown standards - whether it performs\nas well as it claims, and so no direct\ncomparisons between institutions are\npossible. As a result, Essex\nUniversity's EE Department scored\nthe maximum 24 points while the\nequivalent department at Cambridge\nUniversity received only 23. Thus,\nthe rating does not necessarily reflect\nthe quality of degree available.\nNevertheless, members of the\nImperial College Electrical\nEngineering Department maintain\nthat this award of top marks demonstrates the high standards prevalent\namong both staff and students.\nDearing Inquiry visitors fail to educate\nIMEWSTEAM\nFour representatives from the\nDearing Inquiry, set up to advise the\ngovernment on the future of funding\nfor Higher education, came to\nImperial College Union on Tuesday\nto speak to students and gauge their\nviews on funding solutions currently\nunder discussion.\nThe four members of the inquiry\npresent included former IC Rector,\nSir Eric Ash, The current Rector, Sir\nRonald Oxburgh, the committee's student representative from Cardiff\nUniversity, Simon Wright and final-ly, Sir William Stubbs, who\ndescribed himself as \"just trying to\nunderstand what goes on.\"\nSir Ronald Oxburgh began the\nmeeting with a comprehensive intro-duct ion. He explained that while primary and secondary education might\nbe high on the agendas of all political\nparties, Higher education was not.\nRoughly one in three currently go on\ninto HE, and if that number is to\nincrease then so must the funding. In\naddition, many courses are becoming\nincreasingly expensive to teach,\nespecially at more prestigious universities. Sir Ronald stated: \"One way or\nanother, there is going to be pressure\non funds.\"\nThe Dearing Inquiry, The Rector\nexplained, was set up to address this\nperceived crisis in Universities,\nmany of which believe they will be\nunable to continue to fulfil their\nobligation to students if the situation\ndoes not improve. Among the\noptions the inquiry hopes to put to\nthe government is that students contribute towards the cost of their own\nhigher education, either through larger student loans, or through a higher\nrate of income tax for graduates.\nSuch a proposal, according to Sir\nRonald, would have to be \"...framed\nin such a way as to be acceptable to\nthe student population. ...And have\nthe minimum deterrent effect upon\nstudents seeking to enter university.\"\nThe Rector went on to draw comparisons between the British HE system and the command economies of\nformer Eastern Bloc states, pointing\nout that the government decides how\nmany Universities there should be,\nhow many students, and how much\nmoney is allocated for students on\ndifferent courses. If money came to\nUniversities via the students them-selves, Sir Ronald claimed, then students would be significantly more\nempowered and would be guaranteed\nvalue for money, becoming the 'con-sumer s1 of the education system.\nIn addition to loans and a graduate\ntax, The Rector also briefly mentioned other schemes under consider-ation, such as the Labour Party's proposed 'Learning bank' in which fees\nwould be partly met from a learning\naccount set up for each child, and the\nFrench system, whereby students can\ncontinued on page four\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 21ST FEBRUARY LETTERS & EDITORIAL 1 3\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nStudent Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nDear Sir,\nWith regard to your editorial on\n7th February. It is damaging to both\nparties when such poorly researched\nrubbish is published in your pages.\nAfter years of effort, progress is\nbeing made in relations between IC\nand ICSM at St Mary's. Calling us\n\"those students\", \"pesky medics\"\nand suggesting that something which\nwould be of benefit to us would be\n\"at the expense of IC students\" is\nunpatriotic and confrontational.\nThe Student Union of the new\nMedical School will have to run that\nunion on 5 separate sites. It will have\nto have a sabbatical president. It will\nhave to have separate sports teams if\nit is to continue the tradition of competing in Medical School competitions (the UH cup). All these things\nwill cost money, and are a cost\nunique to ICSM. The other CCUs\nhave nothing similar.\nRegardless of the rights or wrongs\nof closer social integration, these\nnecessities mean that the level of\nfunding will have to be different. Our\nfellow students currently based on\nthe South Kensington campus will\nnot notice the difference in their\nfunding, because it will not decrease.\nNor will our funding increase. We\nwill have more students to cater for\nthan ever before, and more sites than\never before on which to do it.\nPlease don't suggest that the submissions of SMHMSSU to the IC\nhierarchy were hasty or ill thought-out. They weren't. Prof Swanson\ndidn't give in to \"a room of baying\nmedics\", he saw the sense of our pro-pos als. They are the best thing for IC.\nWith the merger approaching now\nin its physical sense, harmony and\ncloser links are more important than\never. Reactionary reflex criticism of\nanything seen to be \"good for\nMary's\" must stop. Medics are going\nto be a significant part of life at IC\nfrom 1998, making up 24% of the\nstudents. This is something we are all\ngoing to have to get used to. We\nshould all be looking for what we\nhave to gain from these closer links,\nnot what we stand to lose. With\nCharing Cross about to join IC, what\nsort of impression does this in-fight-ing give to them?\nFor our part, we are committed to\ncloser and more friendly links.\nWould that that were reciprocated by\nthe rest of the students of IC.\nYours faithfully,\nNick Jenkins, 1st year rep\nYour letter contains a lot of sense,\nsomething that is often missing in\nthis debate. However, it also contains a lot of the usual St Mary's propaganda, which leads me to\nsuggest that it wasn't penned by\nyourself. For a fuller reply see the\neditorial.\nDear Mr Feakes,\nThe person who wrote against\nprotest in Felix 1079 has got their\nfacts very wrong. Changes in Law\nbrought in by Conservative governments over the last 17 years have\neroded the rights of the people in this\ncountry to such an extent that they\nare forced to break laws that did not\nexist before. Protest, often violent,\nhas always been the driving force\nbehind changes in legislation in this\ncountry since the Breach of the\nPeace Act of 1324. The authorities\nignore reasoned argument and would\nnever bow without pressure, this\ncountry has riots whereas others\nhave revolutions, I know which I prefer. The Bill of Rights of 1689,\nthough Statute Law over Britain and\nthe European Community, has been\nignored even otherwise the incumbents of the House of Commons\nwould have all been hung for treason\nalong with the lovers of Princess Di;\nso even politicians ignore the Law.\nThe two people killed at veal\nexport protests were both protesters\n(one died of natural causes anyway)\nand by the thinking of the author\nappeared to deserve the consequences. Is this what he/she really\nintended to convey? With regard to\ntrespass, it is not a criminal offence\nto trespass anywhere in this land\nalthough you could face civil litigation for damages caused by that tres-pass.\nFinally, the largest number of\ndeaths worldwide from E coli were\nthe result of eating McDonalds burgers (17 in the US, 2 in Sunderland) so\nis telling the truth really a thing that\nshould be stifled by the improper use\nof libel law?\nYours Sincerely,\nNicholas Royall\nI am glad that you identified the\n'pro' article as provocative. I would add that the CJ A1994 to\nmakes trespass an offence.\nDear Alex,\nRe: Names of Union nights\nOut of interest, how long do you\nthink it will be before the Union call\ntheir Friday night \"Naked girls getting off with each other'V 'Four\nnaked girls and one blok e 'VCum-sucking lesbians\"?\nYours sincerely,\nSacha Manson-Smith.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1081\nis Tuesday 25th February.\nLetters may be e mailed to our\naddress: felix@ic.ac.uk\n\"I WOULD HAVE GOT AWAY WITH IT...\"\nNick Jenkin's letter (this issue) and\nNitisha Singh's letter (last issue)\nabout my editorial in 7th February's Felix raise a number of points worth\nanswering.\nFirstly, I would counter Nick's claim about my editorial being unpatriotic with charges of hypocrisy.\nSecondly, with today's financial\nstrictures, no source of funding is\nsecure, so if the medical students\nreceive a 'ring-fenced' amount of\nmoney, where are the inevitable cuts\ngoing to come? Other, non-ring-fenced, student funding perhaps?\nSuch favour it is m is bound to\nincrease resentment between medics\nand non-medics, which, I agree, we\nmust work together to dispel.\nNobody denies that the geography of\nthe medical schools will incur\nincreased costs for the various\nunions, but the best and fairest way\nto disburse funds amongst student\nservices and societies is through the\nexisting mechanism, ie ICU. This\nwill have the additional benefit of\nproper financial accountability to the\nunion's members.\nFinally, the only reflex criticism\nthat occurs when St Mary's is in the\nnews is by medical students' 'representatives' reacting to comment they\nsee as detrimental to their 'cause'.\nWhy these 'representatives' assume\na victim complex every time there is\nany comment about them I have no\nidea, but it is definitely reactionary.\nWe (by which I mean all non-medics) are not trying to put you (the\nmedics) down; we simply are not\nthat bothered. Any antipathy that\ndocs exist has been generated by St\nMary's xenophobia, which is something the students of Charing Cross\nmight do well to dwell upon.\nProduced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Conson Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

The Bradford\nmatch was won by the concentrated\nefforts of Nick \"Manta Ray\"\nManton, Ed \"Crazy Legs\" Rysdale,\nDave \"Babyface\" Hughes, \"Wild\nThing\" Reuben, Phil \"Perry\" Miller\nand Thorsten \"Sebastian\" Meyer.\nThis was no comparison in the level\nof difficulty to the match that was\nnext - Oxford.\nLast year's champions Oxford\narrived at Imperial all bright-eyed\nand cheery to face the unbeaten\nmen's fencing team. The first\nweapon fought was foil with Crazy\nLegs, Henry \"Tweedledum\" Morton\nand Dave \"Tweedledee\" Davidge.\nThe overall score was 7 - 2 with\nCrazy Legs and Tweedledum losing\na fight each. This was partially\nthrough Crazy Legs and Tweedle\ndum trying to do impressive-looking\nhits - Crazy Legs failed to do a jump\nreverse flick hit to back, but who's perfect (certainly not Crazy Legs). A very good start though!\nNext up the sabre team with the\nfull turnout of Sebastian, Ray and\nAnimal. Oxford put forward a very\nstrong team consisting of Rentboy,\nthe Rose and N man. The match was\nclosely fought with many individual\nfights going to 5-4. When the score\nwas 4-4 in fights (only one left),\nAnimal took on Rentboy in a final\nfight spectacular. Animal took an\nearly lead of 4-0, but through non-electric judging and Animal's self-delusion of already having won,\nRentboy equalise d. At 4-4, Animal\nhad to pull off something special and\ndid so with a stunning parry-riposte\nto win the sabre. The sabre team had\nwon again. The e pee team had to win\ntwo fights to complete the victory,\ncould they do it?\nThe e pee team consisted of Crazy\nLegs and Tweedledum (yes they\nfought again), and Nigel the \"Old\nGeezer\". After three fights the\ne pee is ts had won the overall match\n(nice one Eddie). After this the\nOxford team seemed to be trying\nharder to prevent a total white-wash,\nbut our fencers didn't seem to be trying too hard now the overall match\nwas won. Tweedledum got injured\nand so had to be replaced by the e pee reserve Perry who fenced well and\ndestroyed the Oxford left-handed\ne pee is t that had done quite well with\nthe other two fencers. Unfortunately\nthe overall e pee was lost 5-4 in the\nlast fight (hard luck Eddie).\nAs the overall score was 16-11 to\nIC, Crazy Legs (who just happens to\nthe only Mary's fencer on the team)\nwas \"We're the best team from IC\n'cos we're still in BUSA,\" and after\nsome consideration added, \"The only\nother team that's decent is the Boat\nClub, they've probably got as many\ninternationals as we have.\" IC's men's fencing team is now in the\nfinals of the BUSA Team Cup,\nwhich is held in Birmingham in a couple of weeks time. We have all\nconfidence in winning, as the match\ngoes all the way to the final (which is\ncontested on the Sunday), considering we met our hardest team yet we\nwon by a considerable margin.\nSpecial mentions go to Old Geezer\nwho's the oldest on the team (and at\nthe match) and still won his fights,\nand to Animal who's the youngest\nfencer on the team by a fair margin\nfor winning the deciding fight in the\nsabre. A note of commiseration to\nOxford who went home defeated and\nshame-faced for even thinking for a second that they could beat us. The\nsad fact is that they weren't that great\nat drinking either (the \"black and\nwhite\" game was an absolute mystery to them, never mind).\nICy Snowmen keep their cool\nThe IC ski team gained another good\nre sul y last Sunday at the King's Ski\nClub parallel slalom race.\nDan, Caitlin, Xavier, Nick and\nPaul fought off fierce competition in\nthe first two rounds, winning evey\nrace to earn a place in the final\n(ahead of Cambridge!) Despite a valiant attempt, the team were beaten\ninto second place. This was an excellent performance considering that the\nwinning team consisted mainly of\nEnglish National team members -well done!\nIC runners embrace EC\nAs the sun crept up on Saturday fifteenth, the IC cross country club\nflickered into action. Yellow-arse\n[Alright there, Mr Arse! - Sports\nEds] rejoiced about the perfect blue\nsky for half an hour, whilst others\nnursed their hangovers or cracked\nopen another beverage. One hun-dred-and-fifty foreigners were left to\nsleep in the Southside Gym as we\nprepared for the day's events.\nOnce again, the prestigious Hyde\nPark Relays were upon IC, causing\nhavoc and nearly destruction for the\nweekend, facilities for the day were\nset up and registration started at\neleven. In typical style, no-one\nshowed up until half twelve where\nclocked a time comparable to the age\nof the universe. They still beat\nKings, which is what counts.\nThe Bristol team, having recently\ncome second in the BUSA champi-on ships, captured the spirit of the day\nwith outstanding times and yet a Iighthearted approach. Oxford and\nCambridge came second and third,\nwith IC's A team nineteenth.\nAfterwards teas were dished out\nand prizes presented. Everyone then\nproceeded with the consumption of\nmuch beer and a party. Boat racing\nwas officiated in the union foyer,\nwith Gaffer at the helm, following a minor indiscretion with a member of\nthe Leeds team the af fore mentioned upon chaos ensued. By one we had a field of six hundred competitors.\nA minor catch was an unmarked\ncourse five minutes before the start.\nEmergency measures were taken\nwith last-minute strategic positioning\nof parents/runners and flags enabling\ncompetitors to negotiate their way\naround the Serpentine.\nYellow-arse lead for the first mile\n(on his bike) clearing the course of\nobstructions (children/dogs/ped estr i ans). IC's Pony Tail impressively\nhurdled the carnage to lead the front\nrunners. Unfortunately, this domination of the race was short lived, probably thanks to the influence of the\nDutch team and debauchery in the\nbar on the previous three nights.\nAnother factor was Gaffer missing\nhis change-over (this is a relay race)\nhaving got carried away with himself\nin the loo. However, IC's ladies\nshone on the day, achieving the third\nbest time for a team, with Jennie Cox\ntopping her field with just over\neleven minutes for a lap of the\nSerpentine. Our B team ironically\nwere surpassed by the C team having\nathlete was showered with at least\nthree pints of beer. Events then\nbecame a bit hazy.\nA student might consider this a normal series of events for a Saturday night, but the difference\nhere is that this was organised by IC\nstudents for a race which is\nrenowned throughout Europe's running community. None of this would\nhave been possible without the help\nof the union, security, St Johns,\nRAG, marshals and the members of\nIC cross-country - thank you. The\ndifficulty of organising one of the\nlargest European student relays cannot be appreciated by observing the\nsurface of the event, without the\nabove people it would have been\nimpossible.\nPreparations for next year's event\nare already underway, as it is the\nfiftieth anniversary. There are hopes\nfor an all-star team, indeed Seb Coe\nand David Moorcroft are two of the\nmore famous runners to have raced\nhere. Well done to everyone who\nhelped or entered, this was an unforgettable experience.\n\n"

She\ninsisted that her party's sources of\nfunding did not worry her and\nexpressed \"outrage\" at the suggestion that donations to political parties\nshould be declared.\nMrs Bottomley repeatedly insisted\nthat the electorate does not understand \"how straight government is\",\nwhether it be in dealings with the different parties in Northern Ireland or\nin accepting influence from foreign\nbenefactors of the Conservative\nParty.

With\nher prowess in IC hockey club, her ability to chair\nthe ACC at short notice, and a wealth of other\nachievements in her life, I can only say that Smita is\nthe only viable candidate in my mind, that shows the\nenergy, drive and creativity required of successfully\ncommitting herself to the post. Andrew Gilder\nCurrently I am in my second year of Biochemistry.\nAs captain of the IC ladies First XI hockey team,\nand being actively involved with the ACC, I have\nbecome very interested in the running of the Union.\nTaking a year out during my degree, as a sabbatical,\nthe decisions I make and projects I undertake will\nalso effect me as I still have a final year left at IC.\nAs DP my goals will be a little more realistic and\nless over ambitious. However:\n- With the merging of St Mary's and IC looming,\nI will keep motivating clubs and societies to establish contacts with their St Mary's counterparts. I would like to organise a social sports day with St\nMary's, encouraging (friendly) competition however still trying to create a feeling of unity.\n- I aim to ensure the smooth running of the new\nClubs and Societies Resource Centre, whose plans\nare now well underway. I feel the facilities it will\nprovide will be highly beneficial to all.\n- I feel it is necessary to improve the medical\nfacilities at the sports ground. There should be help\navailable whenever any sports team is using the\ngrounds, and not only on Wednesdays.\n- Finally, I would like to promote the Arts throughout IC.

You 're reading a sabbatical election manifesto. You're better informed and more\naware than 50% of the college population. Before I lose your attention, let's talk about the fun stuff...\nENTERTAIN\nMusic, theatre, the big screen, arts, books, clubs and\nmore. Felix may be a student paper, but it produces\nup to the minute reviews to rival many nationals. I 'll\ntry to make this popular section more diverse and\ncomprehensive.\nThe apathetic among you may like to turn to the\nmore light-hearted SFTW now, because the next\npart is serious...\nINFORM\nGreat change is imminent at IC. Whole departments\nand campuses are shifting in the largest developments since the 1960s. There is opportunity, but also\nrisk that the needs and wishes of the students and\ntheir union will be further marginal is ed.I believe\nI'm Sarah Thomas, a4 th year Chemical\nEngineering student and I'm standing for Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies). I believe I am a good candidate for the job since I am organised,\nfriendly, approachable and I have experience of\nthe way the Union works. During my time at\nImperial I have been actively involved with the\nHockey Club and have been President of the City\nand Guilds College Union, so I have witnessed\nfirst hand many of the problems a student club or\nsociety encounter both from the society mem-ber's vantage point and from a CCU/MSC level.\nAs C&G President, I felt frustrated that I didn't have enough time to dedicate to the post. As a full\ntime sabbatical, I believe I would have the time to\nachieve more and make a bigger difference. I have also been a member of many ICU committees and currently chair Union Council and\nExecutive.\nFelix has a duty to inform - so you know about the\ndecisions that affect your life, and your opinions will\nbe heard.\nIf you've got this far, I suppose you really are\ninterested. In that case...\nINVOLVE\nI want greater student involvement. Felix has a great\ndeal to offer students directly. It provides opportunity for aspiring writers, photographers, designers,\nreviewers and columnists to see their work in print.\nIt offers experience in finance, advertising, and\nresearch. It has excellent production facilities. It's a diverse social centre. Plus, it's the perfect place to\neat your lunch-time curry.\nI'm not making any specific election pledges.\nInstead, I promise to do the job to the best of my\nability so that you get what you want. I believe that\nI can succeed, but I need your help. Make it happen!\nThe integration of the medical students is a large ongoing issue which will become even\nmore important next year as the date of their\nmove on to the South Kensington campus gets\ncloser. I would like to encourage communication\nbetween \"overlapping\" clubs but believe it is up\nto the individual clubs to decide whether they\nwish to integrate or remain separate.\nI also believe that the Clubs & Societies\nResource Centre, due to be built this Easter, has\nthe potential to provide a wide range of services\nto the students. I would like to investigate this\nfurther.\nI believe that I have got a lot out of the Union\nduring my time at Imperial and see this as an\nopportunity to put something back and to help\nothers benefit fully. I also believe I would enjoy\nthe job and would do it well.

Unfortunately\nevery time he meets with success the\nReturning Officer 'decides' to have a new election. Dashed unfair on New,\none might suggest, but it has been\nused in previous years as a vote\nagainst all candidates, a deliberate\n'none of them are any good' as\nopposed to a 'dunno, not sure,\nabstain' kind of thing.\nNot that New is particularly happy\nabout this kind of thing - and will be\ntrying particularly hard this year to\nprove himself better than the other\ncandidates - but due to his propensity\nto have victory snatched from him,\nand another election called, New does\nadvise people voting for him to consider the hassle of re-opening nominations, and whether the candidates currently standing really are all crap, or\nmight just about do.\nMore sage ly, he'd also advise vo t Sam Baker\nAll Posts\ning for people on a more than just the\nquality of their posters, getting a Union card so you can vote in the first\nplace, getting your mother to help you\nwith those sharp scissors and not\nputting too much salt on your food\n(it's bad for the hole in the greenhouse\nlayer).\nOh, and for Christ's sake don't vote\nfor X President\nComing form a varied background encompassing\nRCS Academic Affairs Officer, Dance club\nPresident and through sitting on ICU council, I am\nin an excellent position to appreciate from various\nperspectives the many issues facing the union in the\nyear ahead. These are the continuation of ICU's retailing activities, the arrival of the first medical\nstudents on the South Kensington campus, the ongoing debate concerning student finances and the\nimprovement of social, recreational and sporting\nfacilities.\nAs president I will ensure that the students interests are served within any college proposals for\nchanges to student areas and services. I feel that the\nunion is in the best position to provide this and will\ncontinue to expand the trading activities. The arrival\nof the first medical students requires new attitudes\nfrom many areas, I will represent the wishes of both\nthe new and current occupants of the South\nKensington campus in leading a union that is dedicated to working for all its members. On the issue of\nstudent finances I will convey the consensus opinion\nof the students to other bodies whilst retaining the\nindependence and identity of ICU, giving a voice to\nthe views of you the student. I fully support the\nefforts of removing red tape from the running of\nclubs & societies whilst increasing support and\nassistance in facilitating their activities.\nIt is vital to improve the communication channel\nand liaison between college and students. I am well\nsuited to performing this task as I have had much\nexperience in both dealing with college committees,\nworking within a team and in leadership as part of\nthe union positions I have held. Finally I would like\nto encourage you all to use your vote and have a say\nin the running of your union.\nOmar Kheir President\nNo photo supplied i Top-up fees. They seem to be weighing heavy on\nmost students' minds. My solution to alleviate this\npotentially financial burden? Upgrade IC into a monumental amusement park and leisure complex\nto out-commercial is e all others in time for the mil-lenni um. Think of it, imagine a revolving observation dough-nut riding up and down the Queen's Tower; an accelerated death slide from the top of\nElec. Eng. plummeting twelve floors at near terminal velocity before delivering you gently to the\nbrand new Beit Quad 'restaurant pavilion'; or even\nthe enormous 'virtual university' suite in\nComputing, where you too can experience what it\nwas like to attend university when students were\n'granted' money, and used their time for more then\njust work.\nThe market for such a venture in the heart of\nLondon is obvious. Not only strategically situated\nwithin spitting distance of Hyde Park, the Natural\nHistory Museum, the Science Museum and the\nV&A, IC is the perfect site to develop our vision, as\nthousands of school children visit these fonts of\nknowledge every year. Viola!\nInstead of bothering with the bureaucracy of\nplanning permission, tendering the contracts, the\nlocal residents harassing the council, if a few brave\nsoldiers of Imperial College Entertainment\nComplex Revolutionary Enterprise And Money, or\nICE CREAM, volunteer to violate the Campus\nRenaissance architect's office, switch the blueprints\nand hope no one notices, our goal will soon become\nreality. Thank you, Comrades. All volunteers we l come.
