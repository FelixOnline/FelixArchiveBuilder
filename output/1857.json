    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n8 | SCIENCE 8 November 2024\nO\nn the 23rd of October, NICE made\nheadlines for its decision to reject\ndonanemab - a new Alzheimer\u2019s\ndrug - for use in NHS England, citing\nbudget constraints. This comes after a\nsimilar pioneering Alzheimer\u2019s drug, le-canemab, was also rejected by NICE despite being approved by the Medicines\nand Healthcare products Regulatory\nAgency (MHRA).\nBoth drugs have been\nviewed by researchers as\na potentially big step forward in the fight against\nAlzheimer\u2019s, as they target known causes of the\ndisease rather than just\ntackling symptoms like\nmost drugs currently\navailable on the market.\nDonanemab works by\nbinding to amyloid \u2014\none of the proteins, along\nwith tau, that is associated with Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease \u2014 to clear buildup in\nthe brain. Although not a cure, the drug\nhas been shown to slow the progression\nof cognitive decline in patients with\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease.\nHowever, this comes at a steep cost,\nboth due to the price of the drug itself\nand the labour and equipment required\nto monitor patients for dangerous side ef-fects. It is this cost that led NICE to reject\ndonanemab for use on the NHS. Helen\nKnight, director of medicines evaluation\nat NICE, stated that the potential benefits\nof donanedab are \u201cjust not enough to justify the additional cost to the NHS.\u201d\nThis decision to reject both drugs for\nuse in the NHS has been met with frustration and disappointment by charities.\n\u201cWhile these drugs are not cures and\ncome with the risk of side-effects, trials show they are the first treatments to\nslow the decline in memory and thinking skills linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, rather\nthan just alleviating symptoms,\u201d stated\nHilary Evans-Newton, chief executive at\nAlzheimer\u2019s Research UK, following the\ndecision. There are also concerns that\nthis decision may only widen the pre-ex-isting disparities in healthcare access in\nthe UK; since donanedab has been approved by the MHRA it will be available\nfor use in England, just not on the NHS,\nand therefore some are worried that it\nmay create a two-class system comprised\nof those who can afford private healthcare and those who cannot.\nHowever, others are more understanding of the decision, particularly in\nthe context of an NHS that is already at\na financial breaking point. For example,\nProfessor Paul Morgan at the UK Dementia Research Institute Cardiff labelled the\ndrugs as \u201ceye-wateringly expensive, difficult to administer and potentially harmful\u201d.\nAnother major concern of some charities is that this decision by NICE may dissuade scientists from carrying out pioneering research into Alzheimer\u2019s in the\nUK. As a spokesperson for Alzheimer\u2019s\nResearch UK stated, the announcement\n\u201crisks signalling that the UK is no longer\na good place to launch new dementia\ntreatments.\u201d\nHowever, this was seemingly instantly proven incorrect on the 24th of October, when the Dementia Trials Accelerator was launched by the UK Dementia\nResearch Institute and Health Data Research UK, which aims to enrol tens of\nthousands of dementia patients in clinical trials. This comes after a historically\nlow rate of participation in clinical trials\nin 2021-2022, with just 61 patients partic-ipating. Although this initiative has been\nin the making long before NICE\u2019s an-nouncement, it is impossible to not view\nit as a reaction to the rejection of the two\npotentially revolutionary drugs.\nEarlier in the month, a research team\nhere at Imperial College London received funding from Gates Ventures for a\nthree-year research programme into the\nrisk factors and markers of Alzheimer\u2019s.\nHeaded by Professor Lefkos Middleton\nat the AGE research unit in the School\nof Public Health, the\nprogramme will explore the cognitive\ntrajectories of individuals with differing\nlevels of beta-amyloid\n(the protein targeted\nby donanemab) and\ntau. It will act as a\ncontinuation of the\nCHARIOT PRO sub-study, which is among\nthe largest and most\ncomprehensive studies to explore the\nchanges in cognitive\nhealth in older adults over time. Thanks\nto the funds, the follow-up will expand to\n12 years.\nAlthough NICE\u2019s decision to reject the\nprovision of donanedab and lecanemab\non the NHS is undoubtedly disappointing to both researchers of Alzheimer\u2019s\nand those affected by the condition, these\ntwo new developments disprove the idea\nthat the UK is not a hub for innovative research into Alzheimer\u2019s.\nNew Alzheimer\u2019s drug rejected by\nNICE\nScienceWriter\nAMELIE BURFORD\nDespite setbacks, the quest for groundbreaking Alzheimer\u2019s treatments\ncontinue.\nMagnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer\u2019s disease highlighting white matter hyperintensities Username: MalingeRange (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\n"

Founded in 1990 by Kenneth\nC. Griffin, Citadel is a global financial\ninstitution specializing in investment\nmanagement.\nAt a recent event hosted by the Finance\nSociety at Imperial College, Gillanders\nspoke with Felix about his career journey\nand Citadel\u2019s unique approach to risk\nmanagement, leadership, and talent\ndevelopment. He began by emphasizing\nthe significant impact of Ken Griffin\u2019s\nleadership on Citadel\u2019s sustained\nsuccess. \u201cHis ability to go both broad\nand deep... sets the ethos,\u201d he stated.\nGillanders highlighted that Griffin\u2019s\nvision permeates the firm\u2019s culture\nand drives Citadel\u2019s balance between\ncalculated risk-taking and long-term\ngrowth. \u201cSolving a problem today earns\nyourself the right to solve the next\nproblem tomorrow.\u201d The overarching\ngoal is to foster an environment where\nteams are empowered to innovate within\na disciplined framework.\nGillanders elaborated on Citadel\u2019s core\nstrengths, emphasizing meritocracy, a\nculture centered on problem-solving and\ncollaboration,andarobustinfrastructure\nthat supports scalable investment\nstrategies. He stated that at Citadel,\nmeritocracy is not just a buzzword; it\nis a fundamental aspect of the culture.\nBy focusing on problem-solving and\nteamwork within a flat organizational\nstructure, everyone \u2013 from portfolio\nmanagers to associates \u2013 is committed to\naddressing challenges and contributing\nsolutions. The best ideas can emerge\nfrom any level. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frequent where\nyou\u2019re getting the best answers from\nthe associate, which... creates a great\nenvironment but also creates a great\nlearning experience,\u201d Gillanders noted.\nHe also stressed the importance\nof staying vigilant and continuously\nevolving: \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to\nguard against complacency... always\ntrying to evolve and find better ways\nof doing things.\u201d The strong culture\nof meritocracy and collaboration is\nbolstered by Citadel\u2019s world-class\ninfrastructure and technology. \u201cOne of\nthe things that Citadel does incredibly\nwell is... having all that infrastructure\naround you to support your investment\nprocess,\u201d he noted. \u201cBeing furnished\nwith KPIs and stats that allow you to\nmake better decisions\u201d is integral to their\napproach.\nWhenaskedwhyhereturnedtoCitadel\nafter a break, Gillanders pointed to the\nqualityofitspeopleandculture.\u201cImissed\nthe quality of the people, I missed the\nquality of the dialogue... that problem-solving culture, the collaborative nature\nof it,\u201d he shared. Citadel zealously seeks\nout the best talent, and Gillanders\nmentioned that, like much of the senior\nleadership, he personally seeks out and\ninterviews candidates across all levels of\nseniority.\nWhen hiring, Gillanders seeks\nindividuals from diverse educational\nbackgrounds who share a passion for\nstocks, problem-solving, and\nresilience. \u201cThe first thing\nthat I look for is evidence of passion\nabout stocks,\u201d he explained. He places\na high value on curiosity and a strong\ninclination toward problem-solving,\nwhich he views as essential for success.\n\u201cA degree of curiosity and a problem-solving bias,\u201d he emphasized, are crucial\ntraits for navigating the demanding\nenvironment at Citadel.\nEqually important to Gillanders\nis resilience. Candidates need to be\nable to handle being wrong on a stock\napproximately half the time while\ndemonstrating the ability to bounce\nback and learn from failures. \u201cYou have\nto be able to contextualize and put those\nmistakes in context, learn from them,\nretool and go again,\u201d he explained. For\nhim, the ability to recover, adapt, and\npush forward after challenges is a key\nindicator of future success at Citadel.\nLastly, Gillanders values self-awareness and a structured approach\nto problem-solving. He stressed the\nsignificance of \u201cunderstanding how\nan individual thinks about risk-reward\nand how they handle loss.\u201d He seeks\nindividuals who can methodically break\ndown complex challenges to thrive in\nCitadel\u2019s dynamic environment.\nGillanders also mentioned Citadel\u2019s\nshift toward college campus recruitment\nthrough the Citadel Associate Program\n(CAP). This comprehensive ten-week\nprogram aims to attract and develop\nearly-career investment professionals\nby allowing participants to gain hands-on experience through coding, stock\npitch evaluations, and desk rotations\nthat simulate real-world investment\nprocesses.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going direct to campus,\u201d\nGillanders stated. \u201cWe believe that the\nmentorship that we provide, and the\nsuccess of capturing people earlier in\nour organization actually has a profound\nimpact on their success.\u201d Bringing in\nyoung talent allows the firm to mold\nfuture leaders who share its passion\nfor problem-solving and innovation.\nWith approximately half of Citadel\u2019s\nfundamentalequitiesportfoliomanagers\ndeveloped in-house, the effectiveness of\nthis approach is evident.\nHe concluded by emphasizing that\nCitadel\u2019s recruitment reflects the firm\u2019s\nthorough approach to investment. They\nfocus on identifying individuals with\nstrong potential who will excel within\nCitadel\u2019s dynamic environment. \u201cWe hire\nvery carefully. We seek to understand\nhow they\u2019ll work in good markets and\nbad,\u201d Gillanders stated, highlighting the\nimportance of strategic, long-term talent\ndevelopment at Citadel.\nWith a reputation for strategic\nexcellence in both market investments\nand talent development, Citadel stands\nout as a place to build a career\u2014if you\ncan successfully make your case to\ntheir recruiters. Fortunately, Gillanders\nprovided Felix and Imperial students\nwith key insights on what it takes to\nsucceed.\nIf you wish\nto upload your\nresume to\nCitadel, please\nscan the QR\nCode.\nBUSINESS\nThe Core Values Driving Citadel\u2019s Success\nBusinessEditor\nALIA FRIEDMAN\nDrew Gillanders shows how leadership, risk, and\ncollaboration shape Citadel\u2019s success\nL-R: Jamie M., Alia F., Drew G., William C., Aaron E.\n\n"

Last\nweek I was invited to a couples\u2013costume\u2013only\nHalloween party, but I was the 37th guest. I went\nas the male lead in most Christopher Nolan films,\nwith my own traumatic visions of my ex\u2013wife\ntaunting me. I stuck out like a sore thumb, a fifth\nwheel, a 37th person at a couples\u2013only Halloween party. Being alone, out there, with no one to\ntry and flirt with either so I could at least bury\nmy sorrows with some top\u2013notch chat about if\nthey read the latest edition of Felix and if they\nlike news, I tried reaching out to reconcile with\nher, but apparently that violates the terms of our\nseparation.\nHelp me I\u2019m confused,\nM\nDear Aunty Felicia,\nRecently I found the love of my life and after our\nfirst date at the JCR I knew she was, dare I say,\nthe one? However, I recently discovered at our\nlast anniversary that she is a not only \u201cthe one\u201d\nbut \u201cone of many\u201d and member of a polycule; a\n\u201ccongregation of the flesh\u201d if you will. I\u2019ve been\ndating her for another year now, and our anniversary is coming up again, but I\u2019m having trouble with the gift giving. Do I just get her a gift\nor should I bring gifts for everyone else? I\u2019m in\nmy overdraft right now, and I don\u2019t want to look\nbroke infront of the mutual partners for fear\nthat they won\u2019t invite me to the next communal\norgy. I don\u2019t want to ask her either in case she\nthinks I am having dissident thoughts against\nthe executive polycule committee?\nPlease help!\nYours in a group of many others,\nG\nDear Aunty Felicia,\nDo you think there is a chance we could get a\nLarry appearance at L\u2019s funeral? Believe in their\nlove. As a veteran Larrie, I\u2019ve seen more than\nenough proof over the years to be certain of it.\nL is more cryptic beyond belief, and H - well\n- the flags speak for themselves. We have ALL\nread the lyrics of No Control. Do you think we\ncould get a moment or two of affection at the\nevent?\n- Delularry89\nDear G,\nHave you considered buying a gift that could\nsuit the needs of all parties? I would recommend\npurchasing either a wand or a rabbit, women\nlove these. I would advise against roses or bullets\nthough, as these are clich\u00e9d, unoriginal gifts, and\na tad boring. You want to seem thoughtful. You\nshould prioritise your finances rather than buying\nmultiple gifts, but choose something considerate\n\u2013 perhaps a Hitachi massage wand (every one has\nback pain). Polycules are sometimes into peculiar\nactivities though, so maybe you could get your\ngirlfriend a nice string of beads (a bead for each\nmember) and call it day. I am certain your gift will\nleave you quite the womaniser.\nContact me for some personal Storefront links for\ngifts that I\u2019ve had great reactions to from partners.\nLove to you and your peers,\nAunty Felicia\nDear M,\nI am so sorry to hear that you are not coping well.\n37 is a prime number, so you don\u2019t have any factors dragging you down apart from yourself and\nyour loneliness. It seems like you and Nolan have\na similar issue: a complete inability to understand\nand write women. I do not recommend writing\nto your wife, but instead taking some time to\nheal. Do you think you could contact me with\nyour exact date, time, and location of birth, as\nwell as your ex-wife\u2019s? I think this would give me\nsome great insight. I think you should try investing into some clear quartz as this is the master\nhealer, and maybe lay rest on the rose quartz for\na while. Mindfulness journaling is a great tech-nique, and if you go to my Amazon Storefront\nvia the affiliate link we can get you started with a\nMoleskine journal and some Zebra mildliners.\nLots of love,\nAunty Felicia\nDear Del,\nIn the past I was very infatuated with two young\nBritish vlogger lads residing between Manchester\nand London; some may have referred to me as\ndemonic. Over my life, I have learned to let go\nand be respectful. These two young males you\nseem to regard most highly likely have a strong\nbond, but they do not owe you any access to their\nprivate lives. In my case, I was lucky, as I received\na one hour video with some mild closure. I\nwould recommend you channel this energy into\nyour own romantic endeavours. While fan art is\ncreepy, a painting for the partner is doting and\ndedicated. Narrative work online is neurotic, but\na poem to the partner is deeply romantic.\nAlways here,\nAunty Felicia\n\n"

Only the second non\u2013consecutive\npresident in the history of America, Mr Trump is most emblematic of a country moving away from cartelised political structures back into populist appeal.\nThe Democrat party is a prime example of a cartel party\n\u2013 monopolising Political Action Committees (PACs) and\nheavily partisan media not to appeal to the masses, but\nrather to establish itself as the second political party in a\ntwo\u2013party system. Biden\u2019s presidency failed to capitulate\nvoters because it did not address their concerns about inflation and increases in cost\u2013of\u2013living. Harris, who seemed\nto offer a breath of fresh air, alienated her base by trying\nto appeal to the centre\u2013right, seeking to ingratiate herself\nfor no real material gain. Her policies were lacklustre, and\nthe pitch of not being Trump does not cut it for people\nwho want tangible change in their lives. Not to mention\nthe fact that the Democratic Party seek to patronise their\nvoters, aiming to shame them into voting. Instead of providing policies to vote for, the Democrats have continually\nrelied on the idea that only by voting will your concerns as\na demographic be considered \u2013 a gross inversion of true\nrepresentative democracy. As Olivia Julianna, a pro-Dem-ocrat influencer, said at the Democratic National Convention earlier this year: \u201cIf you are not at the table, you are\non the menu.\u201d And for many voters, the Democrat Party\u2019s\nfailure to prevent them from being eaten by the economy\ncompelled them to turn towards Trump.\nMr Trump, on the other hand, ran a good campaign.\nDespite getting shot at twice, and losing steam in the polls\nafter, he experienced an upturn with his appointment of\nJ.D. Vance, whose eloquence, policy focus and youthfulness played well with voters, even with his general antisocial behaviour and lack of charisma (see the video of him\nat the donut shop in Pennsylvania, or any of his interviews\nwhere he discusses his wife and children), in a way few\npoliticians have. Compare and contrast with Tim Walz, the\nDemocratic Vice-Presidential nominee, who performed\nwell but was muzzled for no apparent reason. Trump\u2019s\npopulist charm as a disruptor and someone who planned\nto make huge, sweeping reforms to the US political landscape ultimately won him an election; clearly, America is\nfed up with the neoliberal status quo.\nIt\u2019s important not to forget, that even if the Harris campaign was bad, there is a huge element of sexism that\nplayed into the campaigns. Unpleasant or not, Ms Harris\nis a woman, and her performance as both Vice President\nand future President was put to much higher scrutiny than\nMr Trump\u2019s. With Republicans planning to restrict women\u2019s access to healthcare and abortion \u2013 despite several\npro-choice referendums winning in red states, no doubt\nbecause women are also allowed to vote \u2013 the simple fact\nis that American men, and men across the West seek to\nreduce the rights that women have fought for across the\npast century. It\u2019s an ugly truth, but it is the truth. The Republican candidates have both been able to make incredibly disparaging and sexist remarks about women with\nimpunity. Women in power are still seen as aberrations,\nviewed by men as intruders into a landscape they do not\nbelong in, regardless of affiliation or their views, and Ms\nHarris, who was subject to claims of sexual impropriety\nin the opening days of her campaign, was no different.\nViewed purely as sexual beings, her loss will always have\nthe subtext that she was a woman campaigning against a\ngroup of misogynists who had no qualms to fight against\nher because of her sex.\nWhilst the UK might seem like a stalwart holding onto\nliberal values as the rest of the West leans further and\nfurther right, our own right\u2013wing parties are beginning to\nturn towards more Trumpian antics. Reform, which came\nsecond in 98 constituencies, and the Conservatives with\nKemi Badenoch as leader, are capitalising on a bubble of\nrising resentment caused by austerity and other fiscal pol-icies. Starmer would do well to realise that he could very\nwell be the next calamity of the populist right.\nCorrection to print edition\nLast week\u2019s letter to the Editor (Issue #1855) was not\naccredited to its author, Steve Connolly, Undergraduate\nEducation Coordinator, Department of Life Sciences,\nImperial College.\nWas that it?\nEditor-in-Chief\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\n\n"

I won\u2019t discuss specific\nunion structures, but rather defend the\nconcept of unionisation for women in the\nworkplace as the way forward. My points\naremostlyrelevanttofieldswherewomen\nare largely outnumbered, such as my\nfield \u2013 theoretical physics, but my beliefs\nextend to any minority group in any\nworkplace. I was inspired to write after\ncelebrating graduation and reflecting on\nmy own experience so far at Imperial.\nEach year, while International\nWomen\u2019s Day and Women at Imperial\nweek roll around, the reality remains\nbleak: in Physics, the number of\nwomen stays low, leaving me ever more\nuninspired.\nFirstly, I will discuss my general\ndistrust of DEI initiatives. It appears\nuniversities and workplaces invent lip-service strategies so they can appear to\nbe aiding change. It appears the focus\nof DEI initiatives is \u201craising awareness\u201d\nrather than doing anything. Crucially,\nthese initiatives do not focus on retention\n(ensuringminoritiesarenotpushedoutof\nacademiaovertime).Thefirstpointwhich\nmakes me skeptical about DEI strategies\nis how easily they blend into capitalist\nstructures, which unfortunately include\neducation, and the corporate world.\nDEI is a recent trend, but I have not\nseen historical examples of organisations\nwhich demanded better conditions\nfor workers be supported by those at\nthe top. In general, movements which\nwere successful in changing working\nconditions usually had to campaign\nagainst management. Socially changing\nany environment usually comes with\nsome kind of pushback or opposition\nand should require campaigning if the\nchanges are to be substantial. We see that\nrelevant organisations, like trade unions,\ntend to consistently be at odds with\nmanagement. We also see that, if allowed\nto operate properly, they are very effective\nin protecting workers. Organisation and\nunionisation are crucial to achieve social\nadvancement in the\nworkplace. Effective\nm o v e m e n t s\ncertainly don\u2019t\nblend easily into\nm a n a g e m e n t\nstructures. DEI\ndoes, which is the\nfirst red flag. If it were doing something,\nthose changes would be apparent, not\njust directly (e.g., substantially increased\nnumbers of women in academia and\nbetter retention), but we would see\nsubstantially more opposition, as we have\ncome to expect with any impactful social\nchange. Additionally, senior management\nlevel departments generally have an\ninterest in the reputation of the company\nor institution.\nThere is a reasonable question to ask:\ncan DEI strategies even solve the issues?\nFor this, we need to ask firstly why\nwomen don\u2019t enter fields like physics,\nand secondly, why so many quit.\nThe answer to the former is a\ncomplicated blend of socialisation and\nmisogyny, with boys still dominating\nschool classes. These problems are far\ntoo extensive: the socialisation pushing\nwomen away from academics starts\nalmost from birth and can\u2019t be solved\nby compulsory empathy courses for\nstudents when they arrive at university.\nOne thing universities can do, however,\nis attempt to investigate their own\nbiases in admissions processes. This\nwould demand thorough, transparent\ninvestigations into whether there\nare links between, for instance, male\u2013\nmajority admissions committees, and\nlower female admission rates, and\nstrategies to change this. I believe\nmeasures like this, which would threaten\nthe reputation\nof universities,\nare things that\nu n i v e r s i t y\nheads would\nbe unwilling\nto implement\nfully without\nsignificant campaigning.\nThe latter point, resulting in a female\nproportion of approximately 10% at\nprofessor level in physics, is again\ncomplicated by social issues including\nuncompensated and disproportionate\ndomestic labour requirements for\nwomen. There is another question as\nto what universities can do about these\nissues, and I honestly think that they\ncannot do much to fix the root causes\nwithout radical social change. Yet, there\nare ways that they can contribute, for\nexample by designing more flexible\nwork schedules for women specifically.\nOverall, the rights of workers need to be\nlobbied and campaigned for; they are\nnot just given from employer goodwill.\nI cannot fathom why social change for\nwomen is not viewed in the same way,\nand why we trust DEI schemes to help us.\nThere is another obvious reason\nwomen leave academics: routine\nmisogyny by their male majority\ncohort or colleagues. Things will not\nchange until men in academia treat\nwomen better, and they will not do this\nwillingly for the most part. It certainly\nhelps to have strong communities like\ndepartmental women\u2019s societies, but\nuntil we are treated with dignity by the\nmajority, nothing will change. Solving\nthis will have to involve some form of\nenforcement as a matter of policy, as it is\nextremely unlikely that men who enter\nacademia as undergraduates after two\ndecades of patriarchal socialisation will\nchange so easily. For example, easier\nmechanisms to report experiences,\nhowever minor, and swift investigation\nand disciplinary action, could be instated\neven at undergraduate level. Calling to\nimplement harsher policies will require\nprotest, and then negotiation for which\nwe must organise.\nThis culminates in the crux of my\npoint: there is no point relying on the\ngoodwillofthoseinchargeofuniversities\nto aid radical change to the status quo.\nTrade unions focus on improving pay\nand conditions, a cause for which they\nare important. The treatment of women\nin academia, and specifically in fields\nlike physics, warrants organised action\ntoo. This could be done by establishing\na new type of trade union altogether, or\nensuring existing unions implement\nnew departments or divisions to lobby\nfor systematic change for both women\nand minorities. The work environment\nwill not change instantly, but it will never\nchange at all if we continue to rely on\nfalse promises.\nCOMMENT\nCommentsWriter\nANUBHA SUKHADA BAL\nDEI and Women in Physics: does DEI work?\nBeyond the superficiality of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion frameworks,\naction must be taken for women and minorities to prosper in the sciences\nThe rights of workers\naren\u2019t just given from\nemployer goodwill\n\u201c\n\n"

However, I\ndon\u2019t use the word \u201cludicrously\u201d lightly:\ncompared to the rest of the piece it\nis incredibly out of place within the\nscore (which possibly lends to its iconic\nstatus) and harmonically it is a gearshift compared with the rest of the piece\n\u2013 in other words, something is not quite\nright.\nTo tell the truth, it isn\u2019t correct at all:\nif Allegri were here now to listen to his\npiece, he would probably scream and\nshout at whomever was responsible for\nsuch gross abuse of conventional 17th\ncentury practices. So how did this come\nabout, who is responsible for this error,\nand \u2013 to quote a famous Claymation\ncontractor \u2013 can we fix it?\nAllegri was a prominent 17th\ncentury\ncomposer in the employ of the Sistine\nChapel when he wrote his famous\nMisererein\u201ctheoldstyle\u201dofcomposition.\nHe used structure and harmony more\nconventional for the renaissance rather\nthan the baroque period of which he was\nactually associated with. The Sistine\nchoirs at that time were notable for their\nflamboyant and rich vocal techniques,\noften using ornamentation that was said\nto be found nowhere else in the world.\nThis idea that you could only hear such\nexpert music in Rome led to the idea that\nthe Miserere could not be taken out of\nthe Sistine chapel (it is more likely that\nyou could perform the music anywhere,\nbut, rather poetically, it would never\nbe the same as hearing it in the Sistine\nchapel itself).\nThe other famous, now believed to\nbe apocryphal, story is that the young\nMozart heard the piece once and\ntranscribed it perfectly from memory\nlater after the service. In reality, many\nfamous composers and musicologists\nwent to great lengths to transcribe not\nonly the outline of the Miserere but also\nto capture the various ornaments and\nembellishments for which the Sistine\nchoir were famous. One such composer\nwas Felix Mendelssohn who wrote a\nbrief excerpt of the score in his journal.\nIt is at this point that things began to\ngo awry: Mendelssohn had transcribed\nthe first part of the Miserere, except\nit was four whole tones higher than\nusual and in a different key, leading to\nthe soprano having to sing the famous\ntop C. However, when musicologist\nWilliam Rockstro decided to compile\nthe Miserere based on existing excerpts\n(including Mendelssohn\u2019s), he made two\nmistakes: first he put Mendelssohn\u2019s\nextract in the second half of the score,\nand second he left Mendelssohn\u2019s\nexcerpt in C minor despite using the\noriginal extract in G minor. He erased\nAllegri\u2019s original harmonic progression\nin the second half, and also allowed for\nthe bass to leap a diminished 5th out of\nthe blue; the diminished 5th is a highly\nfrowned upon in harmonic progression,\nparticularly for music in the time of\nAllegri. In essence, Rockstro had fitted\ntogether the wrong pieces of the puzzle.\nAs such, the harmonic progression\nthat we know today is, quite literally,\nout of place and quite plainly incorrect.\nBut does it matter? If you\u2019re a die hard\ntraditionalist musician, you may think\nthat this is erasure of the original piece,\nand no longer resembles Allegri\u2019s\nMiserere \u2013 if you replace all the music\nto Allegri\u2019s Miserere, is it still Allegri\u2019s\nMiserere? But perhaps this \u2018mistake\u2019 is\nquite fortuitous, after all; the piece is\nfamous among the general public for its\nout-of-place top C, and the strangeness\nof its harmonic progression imbues\na haunting quality which lends itself\nto the time of year when this piece is\nusually performed. Whatever your point\nof view, the thing about\nmusic is that musicians\nare allowed to have their\ninterpretations \u2013 have the\ntop C, don\u2019t have the top\nC. At the end of the day,\nit should be something\npeople are allowed to\nplay around with; and if\nanything it keeps music\nfresh and alive, as is this\n17th\ncentury motet which is\nstill performed to this day.\nAllegri\u2019s Misery\nArtsEditorEmeritus\nGILBERT JACKSON\nHow a terrible mistake led to one of\nchoral music\u2019s most iconic pieces\nRockstro\u2019s Version (now usually perfromed) Gilbert Jackson\nThe Corrected Version Gilbert Jackson\nThe Original Excerpt (17th Century) Gilbert Jackson\nMendelssohn Excerpt (19th Century) Gilbert Jackson\nCULTURE\n\n"

They\nconstantly feel a bit uncomfortable.\u201d\nChoudhury flagged additional\nconcerns, noting that the lack of\nelevator access makes the prayer rooms\ninaccessible to \u201cpeople who have\nmobility issues\u201d. she explains that \u201cit just\nmeans that they would never be able to\nuse the prayer room\u201d.\nWhile the basement is adequate\nfor daily prayers, as they have a time\ninterval in which they can be prayed in,\nit is too small to accommodate the larger\nnumber of students and staff attending\nFriday prayers. With approximately\n300 attendees regularly gathering for\nJumu\u2019ah each week, the basement\u2019s\nlimited capacity\nposes significant\nc o n c e r n s\nregarding time\nmanagement and\nsafety.\nC h o u d h u r y\npoints out, \u201cThe\nproblem with this\nis that you have\n100 people at\nonce packed into\nthe basement.\nWhen something\nhappens, it takes\nthem 10 minutes\nto get in, and 10 minutes to get out. So, if\nsomething like a fire happens, someone\nwill get injured.\u201d\nBeyond logistical issues, persistent\nmaintenance problems such as leaks,\ndampness, and limited ventilation add to\nthe safety hazards in the basements. This\ncan be especially inconvenient for things\nlike \u201cwudu\u201d, the religious ablution that\nmust be completed before each prayer.\nLast November, a water leak in 15B\nPrinces Gardens led to several months\nof work due to the location of a services\npipe that affected other buildings.\nThe Union has attempted to address\nthese challenges by accommodating\nFriday prayers in Beit. Renovation plans\nfor the Great Hall include a dedicated\nwashing area and provisions for Friday\nprayer, but this change is unlikely to be\nput in place before 2026, leaving two\nmore years of struggling with inadequate\nfacilities.\nThe ISoc committee and its members\nbelieve that the best solution would\ninvolve directly engaging with the\nImperial College administration to\nestablish dedicated prayer spaces across\ncampus. Until now, communication\naround prayer spaces has only taken\nplace through the Union.\nAn Imperial College London\nspokesperson said: \u201cPrayer spaces are\na fundamental service for our staff and\nstudent community and providing\nappropriate spaces to meet demand is a\npriority as we continue to develop our\ncampuses.\n\u201cAs part of the renovation of the\nGreat Hall, we have been working with\nImperial\u2019s Islamic Society, the Prayer\nSpaces Working Group and Imperial\nCollege Union to support the hall\u2019s use\nfor Friday Prayers.\n\u201cThere is also work ongoing to\nidentify further opportunities for multi-faith spaces on the South Kensington\nand White City campuses, so we can\ncontinue to support the needs of our\ncommunity in the coming\nyears - with a new space for\nIslamic Prayer set to open on\nthe White City Campus this\nterm.\u201d\nWhen asked why prayers\nare so important for Muslims,\nChoudhury explained: \u201cIt\u2019s\na part of our life, just like\nliving and breathing. And\nwe only want to be able to\nkind of reconciliate the\nspiritual obligations with our\neducational obligations.\n\u201cAnd if college were able\nto acknowledge that would\nmake the lives and the wellbeing of Muslim students\nimprove drastically. \u201c\nNEWS\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 1...\nThis suspicious liquid isn\u2019t urine, but instead the water collected from a leak in 14B Princes Gardens.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial ENVIRONMENT | 9\nISSUE #1857\nT\nhisyear'sGranthamInstituteAnnual\nLecture was given by Caroline Lucas.\nThe former MP and Green Party co-leader spoke about the links between\nthe growth of the far-right and of the\nplanetary crises.\nLast week, according to the United\nNations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change Secretary General,\neven if every country delivers on their\npromises, we will still fall far short of\nwhat's needed. He relayed that this is a\nhuman and economic train wreck, Lucas\nexplained.\nAlongside this, Lucas laid out how\n\"climate has become the new front line\nin culture wars\" with the far-right on\nthe rise and weaponising climate action\na major feature of their playbook. Lucas'\napproach to addressing these twin crises\nis extremely intersectional: \"the case I\nwant to make tonight is that tackling\nclimate breakdown and challenging\npopulism are the same battle.\" She\nexplained that \"nationwide investment,\ndemocratic renewal, community\nresilience, and active hope\" are not only\nessential solutions to the climate crisis\nbut are also the strongest antidotes to the\nrise of populism.\nThe Reform party manifesto for\nexample, Lucas pointed out, contains all\nfive flavours of climate denial: \"it's not\nreal, it's not us, it's not bad, we can't fix it,\n[and] it's too late.\" However, proponents\nof climate action don't do themselves\nany favours by focusing on deadlines\nand taking such a technocratic approach.\nWe lend the far-right strength by letting\nthem set themselves in opposition to\nthat, Lucas continued. They can portray\nthemselves as community-focused, free-choice advocates that are essential parts\nof climate policymaking.\nMessaging is something the Left\nhave been terrible at for as long as I've\npaid attention to politics, and this really\npoints to why. The far right can spew\nas much mis- and disinformation as\nthey want, so long as they are the main\ngroup asking voters \"What are you angry\nabout?\" and \"What do you want?\". They\ncan then direct that energy at whatever\nout-group they wish.\nLucas stressed, \"[We] have to be\ncertain that no one on lower incomes\nloses out, period.\" because failing to do\nthis again hands ammunition to the\nright. See the backlash to the ULEZ in\nLondon, for example. Our investments\nmust, therefore, always be genuinely\nprogressive.\nClimate finance for adaptation and\nresilience continues to fall way short\nof what's needed. Lucas pointed out\nthat adaptation has a special power\nthat mitigation does not, in that it is\nincredibly local. Getting involved in local\nadaptation is essential to community\nresilience. Separate to the talk, leaflets\nfrom Community Energy England,\nthat were distributed in the reception,\nexplained, \"Community energy is people\ngetting together in their communities\nto work on energy solutions to the\nclimate crisis ... all the while increasing\ncommunity cohesion and resilience and\ndelivering huge social benefits to local\npeople.\"\nHumans are natural cooperators, but\nthe neoliberal narrative of people as\nindividuals always competing with one\nanother prevents us from realising this,\nLucas explained. With her PhD in 16th\ncentury literary romance, Lucas made it\nclear that the arts are required to change\nthese kinds of stories. She made the\npoint that this narrative is crucial to a\ndemocratic renewal.\nLucas quoted Czech writer and\ndramatist V\u00e1clav Havel saying, \"hope\nis not the conviction that something\nwill turn out well, but that it is worth\ndoing no matter how it turns out.\" As\nmuch as adults take so much hope from\nyoung people, Lucas reminded us, they\nmust give something back, and not only\nprotect young people, but centre them in\ndecision making. She concluded, \"Being\ndenied hope is a political and a moral\nfailure.\"\nLucas joined Prof Tahseen Jafry,\nFounding Director at the Mary Robinson\nCentre for Climate Justice, Jon Alexander,\nCo-founder of the New Citizen Project,\nand Zamzam Ibrahim, former president\nof the National Union of Students for a\npanel and Q&A.\nThe panel weaved from climate justice,\nto storytelling, global dev elopment, to\nproblems with politics in the UK and\nanti-capitalism. Jon Alexander explained\nhow talking about anti-capitalism might\nnot be enough, because it focuses on the\nthing we aim not to be. He emphasised\nthat we cannot solve the problem\nfrom within a system that frames us as\nindividuals.\nZamzam Ibrahim spoke eloquently\nabout justice and how not working\nthrough a justice lens only ends up\nexacerbating those problems. She used\nan analogy from Malcolm X when talking\nabout the need for climate adaptation\nand mitigation: \"if you stab me nine\ninches and pull out the knife six inches,\nthen you haven't solved the problem. If\nyou pull it out all the way you still haven't\nsolved the problem. Solving the problem\nis in healing. How do we heal our\ncommunities?\" She explained the need\nto focus on how we can \"unfuck ourselves\nand the systems and rebuild systems of\njustice\" to a round of applause.\nAfter the event, the energy was\npalpable. Ideas from such exciting\nspeakers set a high bar for climate action\nat Imperial and beyond, while clearly\nlaying out what needs to be done.\n\"Anti-capitalism: I'm all\nfor it\" says Caroline Lucas\nat Imperial lecture\nENVIRONMENT\nEnvironmentEditor\nOSCAR MITCHAM\nGrantham Institute's annual lecture cut through the\nnoise with former Green Party co-leader and panelists.\nBeing denied hope is\na political and a moral\nfailure.\n\u201c\nThe Great Hall was packed for the event.

There were a variety of reasons for\nthenewpeoplejoining;somewantedto\u2018try\nsomething new\u2019 while others heard about\nthe society through friends and decided to\njoin after looking at previous events. One\nmember commented \u2018I was quite nervous\nbecause I\u2019ve never done life drawing\nbefore, but it wasn\u2019t so scary\u2019. Others were\nrather surprised that the subject of the art\nwould be nude (our editors included) although\nby the half-way point everyone had managed to\nsettle in. Another, more experienced, artist would\ngo on to tell me their reason for joining: \u2018for me,\nart is my biggest passion\u2019.

Chances are, you\u2019ll see videos promoting the exact same books,\ndiffering only by influencer flair or corny\nhook \u2013 a rotation of \u201cBooks that altered\nmy worldview\u201d, \u201cYou have to read this\u201d or\n\u201cNovels that left me in pieces\u201d. It\u2019s repetitive and yet undeniably hypotising.\nI acknowledge the good BookTok has\ndone. The promotion of reading on social\nmedia has helped revitalise young people to rediscover their love for reading.\nIt has created communities to encourage\nreading, share recommendations, and\nfoster discussion. These are all things we\nwant in the world of literature. However,\nthere is a deeper issue at the root of this\nphenomenon that makes me reconsider\nBookTok\u2019s \u2018positive\u2019 impacts.\nMy qualm with BookTok is twofold.\nFirst, the stagnation beyond shallow level\nexcitement and engagement with books.\nA reader picks up a book by, let\u2019s say, Colleen Hoover. It\u2019s gripping. It\u2019s a quick and\neasy read. They want to read more. So\nthey reach for another book that fits the\nmould, this time by by Ali Hazelwood.\nOn paper, the plot is different. But upon\ncloserinspection,thestyleandthetropes\n\u2013 enemies-to-lovers, friends-to-lovers,\naccidental romance \u2013 are the same. A different font for the same brainrot.\nWhile reading should no doubt be for\nenjoyment, it should also function to\nchallenge our perspectives and expand\nour understanding of the world. The\nf u n - damental nature of TikTok is to\ncreate an algorithm that magnifies what\nwe already know. How do we go beyond\nthe trappings of our knowledge echo\nchambers if we are being fed the same\npredictable content?\nMy second problem with BookTok is\nits reshaping of the literary landscape\ntowards hyper-consumption, much like\nthe fast-fashion industry. Books are being turned into addictive commodities,\nloaded with repetitive ideas. They no\nlonger imbibe a profound social truth,\ninstead stimulating us with the instant\ngratification of either finishing a book or\nmass consuming media.\nAs author Leigh Stein pointed out in\nher LitHub piece \u2018BookTok is Good, Actually\u2019, BookTok has a captive audience that\nmakes it an ideal place for new authors to\nbreak into. What remains implicit in the\narticle, however, is that BookTok is only a\ngood platform if you conform to its gim-micks. The platform rewards a specific\nformula to gain readers\u2019 attention, and\nauthors who attempt to gain\ntraction\noutside these\nparameters ofter find themselves s t i -fled by the demands of a trend-driven\nmarketplace.\nThe result is a dilution of original,\ncreative material. This recalls themes in\nYellowface \u2013 a novel that ironically blew\nup on BookTok \u2013 giving insight into how\nauthors play into the desperation of remaining relevant in the harshness of the\npublishing industry.\nWhile the commodification of books\nmay not seem so dire, it coincides with a\nworrying trend in education: literature is\nbeing pushed out from classrooms. Classic novels such as To Kill a Mockingbird\nare being banned, and while this isn\u2019t\ndirectly related to BookTok, it reflects a\nwider cultural shift.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n12 | FILM&TV 8 November 2024\nT\no preface this, I must admit that while I am a big\nhorror fan, I\u2019m not necessarily a fan of supernatural or religiously inspired horror unless it\u2019s done in\na genuinely clever way, like Paul W. S. Anderson\u2019s Event\nHorizon. I would even class the first two Hellraiser movies as those that get the supernatural right. I am not the\ntarget audience of The Conjuring, but when one sees that\nThe Conjuring franchise is the highest-grossing horror\nfranchise of all time, one does begin to wonder if they\nare actually any good.\nAnd, to my honest surprise, the first two movies in\nthe main franchise are decent. The Conjuring is a lovely,\nif slightly conventional flick that does some genuinely\nclever things. I appreciate how at times the camera work\nis presented in documentary fashion, as well as the subversion of jump scares into scares that are genuinely\nterrifying; one scene that comes to mind is when the\nmother in the first film (the family is clich\u00e9d and mostly\nrather forgettable, apart from Joey King\u2019s character who\nis great as a scream queen) is locked in the basement\nwith just matches, only for hands to appear and clap\nbehind her \u2013 a much better effect than some makeup\ncaked oddity jumping out into the camera.\nThe second movie is set in Enfield and is much scari-er, again due to the fact it utilises more of these subver-sions. Things never seem to happen the way they think,\nand you\u2019re edged onwards in a constant state of tension,\nwaiting for something to happen. However, the mass\nmarket appeal plays more into the second outing, since\nit not only does have more scares, but also more jump\nscares. And the god damn nun.\nThe Nun, and the Nun in it are not that scary. Yes, they\ndo cool things with her in The Conjuring 2, but The Nun\nis a schlock fest. It\u2019s an idea purely borne by the fact that\neverything to do with Catholicism is now spooky and\nscary. The subtext \u2013 though I doubt the writers planned\non it happening \u2013 is of course based on the Catholic\nChurch having been beset by scandals over the past few\nyears and is no longer the same hallowed institution\nin a secular and sceptical world. But that is boring. It\u2019s\nthe same shtick played out again, and since it\u2019s a cash\ngrab spin-off designed because the Nun was scary, they\nuse the movie as an excuse to get the masses into seats,\nthrow in a bunch of medieval looking imagery, which\nisn\u2019t even close to any real magic \u2013 compare it to the actual Ars Goetia for the real Valak who is a demon that\nfinds treasures. It\u2019s certainly not a scary nun whose\nscreams can launch people into the sky, like they do several times consequtively in the climax of the movie.\nYou can see such degradation over time, as this promising horror franchise slowly replaces the thoughtfulness its scares had with cheap, gimmicky, and trope-lad-en movies. I haven\u2019t seen any of The Conjuring movies\nbeyond The Nun, but if it\u2019s anything to indicate the direction of this franchise, I am not interested. Horror is\nevergreen, and has had a particularly good few years in\nthe late 2010s and early 2020s. There\u2019s plenty more out\nthere \u2013 watch a Robert Eggers flick instead.\nMoney made me do it\nFILM&TV\nHow TheConjuring franchise is the best\nexample of dilution through mass appeal.\nFilmWriter\nBARNABY HILTON-ROYCE\n\n"

This was negligibly larger than the\npercentage of candidates who moderately used AI, 48.6%, suggesting using AI\nto entirely generate a manifesto offered\nthe same, if not more chance of success\nas using it to edit or brainstorm a mani-festo. The proportion of candidates who\nwere elected using little to no AI was only\nslightly larger at 57.2%, indicating that\nuse of AI, while obvious in majority of\ncases, did not significantly disadvantage\ncandidates. As the figures show, around\ntwo-fifths of the elected candidates used\nAI to assist their campaign partially or\ntotally.\nThe use of AI varied depending on the\ntype of role applied for. The majority of\ncandidates for both CSPs (Clubs, Societies and Projects) and Representatives\nhad little-to-no AI use in their manifes-tos. However, the data for Liberation and\nCommunity Networks showed a slightly\ndifferent story. The Liberation and Community Networks (LCNs) candidates were\na smaller group, given the lesser number of roles to apply for and comprising\nof only 65 candidates out of a total 962;\ndespite the lower number of roles, the\nAI usage in this group of individuals was\nmuch more significant than either of the\nother two categories. Almost half of the\nentries for LCNs were created with a significant use of AI.\nThere were several cases of candidates applying to multiple positions using AI-generated manifestos. Notably, in\nthe case of the LCNs roles having a higher proportion of significant AI use, one\ncandidate applied to nine roles using\nAI-generated manifestos, which amounted to 13.8% of total applications within\nthe LCNs category. In addition, two candidates in the CSPs group submitted 15\nAI-generated applications each, which\nincluded several applications to literar-ily oriented societies such as Felix and\nWriter\u2019s Society. Applications to become\nrepresentatives were not excluded from\nsuch cases with one individual applying\nto seven roles with AI-generated mani-festos. As many of these manifestos were\neither the only entry or the singular entry\nwith a manifesto for a role, these individuals were elected to several posts each.\nFelix also identified five unique authors of manifestos who each submitted\n10 or more manifestos for roles. In total,\nthe five authors submitted 70 applica-tions, with the most submitted by a single author being 19 applications. Of the\n70 applications, 44 had written mani-festos. 31 of these were flagged as being\nsignificantly likely to have been written\nby AI, corresponding to 70% of the total\nwritten manifesto count in this sample\u2013\nnotably higher than the typical rate of\naround 20% significant chance of usage\nof AI for the full dataset.\n\n"
