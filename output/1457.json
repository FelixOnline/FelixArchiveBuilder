If SF authors are to be\nbelieved, books are eventually going to\nbe phased out in favour of eBooks, and\nin the 21st century, major publishers\nand content distributors seem to agree.\nBoth Barnes and Noble and Amazon\nhave been aggressively selling their\neBook readers, and even Apple\u2019s iPad\nwas announced alongside a New York\nTimes Reader app to make the online\nversion of the paper resemble the real\nthing much more closely. Yet apart\nfrom relatively strong sales of Amazon\u2019s Kindle, the response to the concept of eBooks has been lukewarm at\nbest. On one hand authors are deterred\nby the thought of piracy eating away\nat profit margins, while on the other,\nreaders don\u2019t seem to be attracted to\nthe prospect of buying an expensive\ndevice that has only one real function.\nThe price of your average eBook\nreader in it\u2019s current incarnation is\none reason why I don\u2019t consider them\nto be any more than a shiny toy for\nearly adopters. With the 6-inch Kindle\npriced at a hefty \u00a3170, it\u2019s not the sort\nof thing you would pick up on a whim,\nespecially on a student budget. Even at\n\u00a3170 you get little other than a reader.\nMost books are priced at upwards of\n\u00a35, which means that a 20-book collection on a reader would cost as much\nas \u00a3270, a price which would probably\nbuy you upwards of 75 used books in\ngood condition, much more reading\nthan I do in an average year. Some\nreader manufacturers have suggested\nthat the devices could also replace\nprinted textbooks, with the ability to\nannotate text making for interactive\ntextbooks that hold all your notes. Yet\ne-textbooks can cost as much as \u00a350\neach; more than already overpriced\npaper textbooks. With the ability to\nonly open one book at once, you can\u2019t\nexactly spread your books out over a\ntable either.\nThe problem with true eBook readers is that they are a few years ahead of\ntheir time. Although the cost of buying\nand using the Kindle or some similar\ndevice is high, the fundamental problem doesn\u2019t lie with pricing, but with\nscreen technology. The Kindle and its\nbrethren use a particular type of dis-play, E-Ink, that\u2019s not in use on many\nother devices. The display technology\nis designed to mimic the look of actual\nprint with high contrast and density,\nreduced eye strain created by the need\nfor backlights and allowing for longer\nreading sessions. The catch? The refresh rate and lack of colour of current\ngeneration E-Ink severely limits the\ngraphical capabilities of these devices,\nmaking them useless for much more\nthan reading and light web browsing.\nAmazon\u2019s claim of \u201816 shades of grey\u2019\nsounds like something out of a television advertisement from the 1940s.\nTherefore, current eBook readers will\nnever be able to play a YouTube video\nor render game graphics, making them\noddities at a time when most devices\nare capable of handling a variety of media simultaneously.\nApple seem to think they have solved\nthis problem with the iPad. The LCD\nscreen can serve up any media you\nrequire, while the screen is just the\nright size for reading. Seeing potential\nto own the market, Apple has made\na serious push into the eBook space,\nlaunching an iBookstore similar to\niTunes, with works from most major publishing houses featuring on its\nshelves. Yet whether this gamble will\npay off is quite questionable. I\u2019ve tried\nreading eBooks on laptops for many\nyears now and I can\u2019t stand reading\nmore than a few pages of text at a time.\nI wouldn\u2019t mind glancing through a\nnewspaper, but reading the entire Lord\nof the Rings trilogy on an LCD screen\nwould probably blow my eyes out,\nif my Computing degree doesn\u2019t get\nLook at you, peasant. With all your books and a laptop, oh how you live in the last century.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week in Tech has\nflown by, but what have we got\nto show for it?\nWell, have you ever wished\nyou could fly? Not in a plane I\nmean, fly like Superman? Yeah,\nI have too. Well I\u2019m afraid\nit\u2019s impossi-ble, but\nyou can\nhave\nthe\nnext\nbest\nthing, the\nMartin jet-pack. The\njetpack in\nquestion is\ndestined to be the first commercially available later this\nyear, and at $86000 it\u2019s not\neven as much as a fully specced Lambo. This personal flying marvel is powered by a 2L\nV4 two-stroke engine spinning\ntwo carbon-kevlar composite\nrotors, running on bog standard petrol with a flight time of\n30 minutes. Now if that doesn\u2019t\nbeat the pants off your mate\u2019s\ncrappy sports car, I don\u2019t know\nwhat will.\nYou could be forgiven for\nthinking the OO HD wireless\nprojector, crappy name I\nknow, was some\nsort of\nspaceship,\nperhaps\neven something\nout of War of the Worlds.\nPacking 1080p projection, an\nSSD, WiFi, Li-ion battery and\ninternal decoders, this concept could be the all-in-one\nmedia sensation that you\u2019ve\nbeen looking for. Mind you, if\nit ever materialises into the real\nworld, don\u2019t expect it to come\ncheap. Guess it\u2019s the price you\npay for function and beauty.\nSony\u2019s been busy this week\nbuilding up the HD content\non its Playstation Network\nwith the announcement of all\nsix major movie studios coming on board. 20th Century\nFox, Walt Disney,\nParamount,\nUniversal,\nWarner Bros.\nand Sony\u2019s own Sony\nPictures Entertainment have clubbed\ntogether to make\na massive 19 HD\nmovies available\nfor rent or to buy.\nOK, I might be\nexaggerating a bit,\nbut it\u2019s a step in the\nright direction for all those\nwielding a PS3 right? Currently\nonly available in the US, Sony\u2019s\npushing for a UK, France, Germany and Spain release soon.\nMore car news this week\nfrom the Geneva Motor Show.\nAre you an Aston Martin DBS\nowner, who just wishes he had a\nsmaller Aston for the city run-around? Well for the princely\nsum of around \u00a330,000 you can\nhave the Aston Martin Cygnet. Packed with\nfeatures like a\nfancy iPod\ndock, leather interior\nand lots\nof chrome\nthroughout,\nthe Toyota IQ\nbased Cygnet is your way of\ngiving the finger to all those\nMini drivers who think they\u2019re\nthe dogs. Think I\u2019ll just stick to\nthe DBS thanks.\nHaving shown the world the\nincredible faster-than-a-Car-rera-GT 918 Spyder\nHybrid concept,\nwhich we saw last\nweek, Porsche\nalso rolled out\nthe insane looking 911 GT3-R Hybrid con-cept. Porsche has ditched the\nbattery for a flywheel, which is\nspun up to 40,000 rpm by the\ncar decelerating. A generator\nturned by the flywheel then\npowers a pair of 60kW electric\nmotors attached to the front\nwheels. The system incorporates a boost button like that\nfound in the F1 KERS system,\nadding 160bhp for up to 8\nseconds. Finally, a real turbo\nboost!\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs\nA\nnother week\u2019s flown by and\nbam, we\u2019re into the middle\nof March. This week saw\na lot of car tech attention\ndue to the Geneva Motor Show that\u2019s\nbeen going on. Most of the technology on show has been based around\ntraditional hybrid cars, admittedly not\nfrom traditional hybrid manufactur-ers. Who\u2019d have thought when Toyota\nfirst launched the Prius that the likes of\nPorsche and Ferrari would follow suit\nwith high performance hybrids? Of\ncourse those in the know realise that\nhaving an electric motor is far from a\ndisadvantage for potential sports cars,\nwith maximum torque right from the\nget-go and carried through the entire\nrange of acceleration. The problem lies\nin supplying the electric motor with\nenough power for any decent range.\nThis is why most hybrids currently\nrun a conventional combustion engine\nwith an electric motor tacked on for\nlow speed, short range driving. Cars\nlike the new plugin Prius drive with\nthe electric motor up to about 23km\nwith a maximum electric-only speed of\n100kph. Once the battery is depleted,\nor the speed you\u2019re demanding from\nthe car is greater than 100kph, then the\npetrol motor kicks in to power the car\nand recharge the battery.\nThis means that you haven\u2019t removed\nthe petrol problem. Of course you can\nuse biofuel or some ethanol based fu-els, but it\u2019s still a carbon emitting fuel\nyou have to use. Hybrids are going\nto be forced into the mainstream for\nlarger engine cars in the next couple of\nyears once the EU\u2019s emissions regulations kick in. But hybrid cars are holding back development of true, non-fuel\ndependent solutions. A poor stop gap\nin the progression of the humble car.\nthere first.\nWill eBook readers eventually catch\non? Almost certainly, as they should.\nThe concept of a centralised bookstore that can distribute books over\nthe Internet 24/7 without running\nout of stock is great. eBooks will last\nfor longer and, as Project Gutenberg\nhas proved, could well turn out to be\na great way of preserving books for future generations. Yet before they can\nachieve ubiquity, the technologies they\nare based on have to improve drasti-cally. E-Ink needs to become more\nversatile or be replaced with another\ntechnology, and varying book formats\nshouldn\u2019t mean that you are locked to\na manufacturer for life, just because\nyou started collecting books on one of\ntheir devices. Realistically, it will take\nat least a few more years before you see\nthem on the bus home. If you hold off\nbuying them now you\u2019ll probably get a\nmuch more mature and versatile device with a much smaller price tag.\nSamuelGibbsTechnologyEditor\nit\u2019s\nthin\nMa\npa\njetp\nquest\ny\nsome\nthing\ng\nFox,\nand Son\nthe world the\nthan-a-Car-der\nt,\nboost!\nin-ed\ne\nD\n,\nthe\nnet.

Nick Clegg\nhas called on schools to reinvent the\ncurriculum, raise results and close the\nattainment gap between rich and poor,\nan important step towards equality.\nIn a speech at the Association of\nSchool and College Leaders confer-ence, Nick Clegg promised to find\n\u201cextra funding, even while elsewhere\nthere are cuts\u201d.

The\nTories have said the biggest risk to an economic recovery was\nMr Brown staying in power and that the key is to act to cut the\ndeficit to begin straight after the election. Gordon Brown also\nannounced a pay freeze for all senior public servants.\nHague vows to return\nUK to world stage\nVoters in Switzerland\nhave rejected a recent\nproposal to introduce\na national system of\nstate-funded lawyers\nto represent labradors\n(pictured), amongst\nother animals, in\ncourt. Animal rights\ngroups proposed the\nmove, but the proposal was rejected by\naround 70% of voters\nin a referendum. Opponents, including the Swiss govern-ment, had argued that Switzerland did not need more legis-lation. Switzerland already has some of the strictest animal\nwelfare legislation in the world.\nSwiss vote \u201cno\u201d on\nlabrador lawyers\nShadow foreign secretary William Hague\nsaid the UK\u2019s economic and diplomatic\npower has steadily\nreduced under Labour\nand the UK risked \u201cretreating into its shell\u201d.\nMr Hague argued the\nUK\u2019s international\neconomic status was\n\u201cdiminishing\u201d under\nLabour and the UK\nrisked dropping out of the list of the world\u2019s top ten economies by 2015. With regard to Europe, William Hague said the\nTories would seek to play a constructive role on issues such\nas trade, the environment and energy security.\neral Democrats are proposing a pupil\npremium system where an average of\n\u00a32,500 would be attached to each pupil from a disadvantaged background\nand go directly to the school they are\nattending. This money would be on\ntop of the existing education budg-et, leading to an overall increase in\neducation spending. In contrast, the\nConservatives have proposed a similar system but using money already\nin the education budget to fund it,\neffectively only redistributing existing funds.\nA report by the Institute of Fiscal\nStudies suggested that pupil premium\nschemes would lead to budget cuts in\na significant minority of schools unless extra money was attached. In the\nLiberal Democrats\u2019 plans, the premium is funded from outside the budget.\nThis may lead to increased cuts in other areas as set out in the party\u2019s current\nplans.\nUnder the current system, schools\nget money for the deprivation levels\nin the local authority area rather than\nwithin the schools themselves. Under\nthis system, state schools in affluent\nareas get a small amount of money. In\nthese areas, people can afford to send\ntheir children to private schools, leaving the less well-off constituents of the\narea to go to the underfunded local\nstate school.\nMr Clegg told the conference he\nwanted Britain to be a place \u201cwhere\nit is no longer possible, on a pupil\u2019s\nfirst day of school, to predict how well\nthey\u2019ll do simply by asking them how\nmuch their parents earn\u201d.\n\u201cSo, a deal between government and\nschools: Money and freedom in return for high expectations and more\nambition.\n\u201cWe will give a level of freedom you\nhaven\u2019t known for decades. But, in re-turn, we will place the greatest expectations on you any government ever\nhas.\n\u201cOne - we will expect you to transform the curriculum, so that it is rich,\nrelevant and stretches the brightest pupils while elevating those who struggle.\n\u201cTwo - we will be much more ambitious about the number of young men\nand women leaving school with good\nresults.\n\u201cThree - we will expect you to close\nthe gap between poorer children and\ntheir wealthier classmates, a gap which\nentrenches inequality in Britain today.\u201d\n\u201cExtra funding [for\neducation], even\nwhile elsewhere\nthere are cuts\u201d\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack Politics Editor\n\u201cMoney and\nfreedom in\nreturn for high\nexpectations and\nmore ambition\u201d\n\u201cWe will be more\nambitious about\nthe number of\nyoung men and\nwomen leaving\nschool with good\nresults\u201d\n\n"

The talk will be hosted and organised by the Imperial College Finance Society\nN\next Tuesday, Imperial\nCollege Finance Society\n(ICFS) will be welcoming Muzaffar Khan to\ntalk to students about\na number of interesting projects that\nhe is currently engaged in. Muzaffar is\nPrincipal and Board Member of Space\nEnergy AG, a company with an ambitious aim to develop Space-Based Solar Power satellites that generate and\ntransmit electricity to receivers on the\nEarth\u2019s surface. This fits well with his\nextremely confident and ambitious\noutlook on life, which he has tried to\npass on as a mentor to a range of people of diverse ages and backgrounds.\nMany of us remember his most successful case, Jan Sramek, from last\nyear\u2019s popular \u2018Inside Trading\u2019 panel\norganised by ICFS.\nThe two of them have recently published a book called Racing Towards\nExcellence. This is a common sense-based guide for individuals, especially\nyoung people and students. It deals\nwith academic, career, financial and\npersonal success, as well as factors that\nmay prohibit this. The clear, simple\nlanguage and structure of the book is\nsupported by new results from emerging sciences, especially behavioural\npsychology and neuroscience. Many\ntopics are covered, with broad concepts ranging from the importance of\nlove to ways of inspiring oneself.\nThe book then deals with more\nspecific issues, ranging from physical\nwellbeing through networking to making the most out of leisure time. One\nof these sections in particular \u2013 \u201cMentors and Buddies\u201d \u2013 benefits from the\nrelationship of its two co-authors,\nand the insight that this gives to both\nof them. Some reviews have been im-pressive, whilst others have questioned\nthe ability of Jan Sramek as a final year\nundergraduate student to be offering\nadvice on life. Muzaffar explained that\nthis misses an important point, which\nis that the life experience comes from\nhim and not Jan. What Jan brings to\nthe book is a great personal example of\nhow far using the experience of a good\nmentor can take you.\nMuzaffar\u2019s own background started\nin finance. He then developed his interest in environmental issues and so\ngot involved with a green charity, before entering the highly risky field of\ncarbon trading before a market for the\nasset class had even been established.\nIn conjunction with these business ac-tivities, he has also maintained a long-term interest in mentoring. His CV is\nextensive, and you can find out more\nabout him at muzaffarkhan.org. Last\nweek he sat down with felix to discuss\nhow each of these varied interests be-gan, as well as the ideas that are important to him and guide his current\ngoals.\nBack in 1993, Muzaffar and two of\nhis brothers were heading towards successful careers, having achieved strong\nacademic results. Their other brother\nhowever, was struggling at school. The\nfour of them were boarding in a British\nschool whilst their parents had to live\nabroad. This gave Muzaffar, the oldest\nof the four, a great amount of responsibility for the others. When the school\ntalked to him about his younger brother\u2019s struggles, his lifelong commitment\nto mentoring began. That brother ended up at the prestigious University of\nEdinburgh, and many others followed\nhim in benefiting from Muzaffar\u2019s\nmentoring over the years.\nMuzaffar plans to return to Imperial\non 18 May to discuss his Space Energy\ncompany, but the talk this Tuesday will\nmainly be on another project, which is\nAlchemy Ventures.\nThis is his attempt to encourage children from underachieving schools to\naim high and aspire towards some of the\nsuccesses that are discussed in Racing\nTowards Excellence.\nIf you attended the trading panel event, you will likely remember Jan Sramek, Muzaffar\u2019s co-author. Growing up with\nmodest means, Jan now works for a leading bank. He credits advice included in his book account for some of this success.\nWill the talk be worth going to?\nAside from Muzaffer\u2019s record of supporting young people as they\nprogress academically and professionally, there is another good reason\nto attend this talk. Last year, Racing Towards Excellence co-author Jan\nSramek, who is a trader at a leading investment bank, participated in a\ntrading panel event. Jan\u2019s articulate sharing of key insights helped make\nthis one of my favourite ICFS events of that year. Since Muzaffar has\nbeen described as Jan\u2019s mentor, he will also have useful and interesting\nideas to share.\nThe panel last year shared many valuable pieces of advice. Some of these\nwere new to most attendees. But just as important were the many reminders\nof things that most people probably know but do not consistently factor into\ntheir decision making. For example, they reminded us that company cultures\nvary greatly, so it is important make sure you work somewhere that is suited to\nyour personality. This may seem obvious, but for instance at that time I assumed\nthat firms in similar industries share similar cultures. One panel member, Ben,\nexplained that this was not true: whilst he loved where he worked at the time,\nstaff at his previous employer made him eat Big Macs until he got sick, just for\nlaughs.\nThe panel also helpfully shared a good reading list for students looking to enter\nthe financial industry, or go into business in general:\n- Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds - published in\n1841, this book on people\u2019s irrationality contains one of the earliest histories of\nfinancial market crashes.\n- McKinseyQuarterly.com - A great business magazine by the world\u2019s most\nprestigious management strategy consultancy, available free online.\n-Afewwell-recievedandeasy-to-read\u201cinsider\u2019sguides\u201dtotheworldoffinance:\nInside the House of Money; Barbarians at the Gate; Liar\u2019s Poker; Traders, Guns\nand Money; and My Life as a Quant.\n- They also recommended some reading on asymmetric information in markets,\nformal logic, and cognitive science. They suggested The Paradox of Choice as\noffering a good insight into how people actually make everyday economic\ndecisions, rather than how they do it according to numerical models.\n- I am fairly sure that if the talk was held today, Racing Towards Excellence\nwould also make it on their list:\nThis talk by Muzaffar on the 12th will\nof course be very different. It will\ncover more topics, offering a variety\nof anecdotes and lessons learned from\nan interesting life in business, politics,\nand philanthropy. His message is\nworth hearing, and certainly differs\nfrom a typical self-help talk. The talks\nwill however, share in common an aim\nto get students tothink about high-powered jobs in the city, Muzaffar\nwill explain why and how it is possible\nto succeed in finance and other areas,\nusing examples that range from the\ngeneral, such as Muzaffar\u2019s philosophy\nonlife,tothespecific,suchasUNICEF\u2019s\nlistofkeylifeskills.\n\n"

Having been\ndescribed as \u2018pop songs for rock\nkids\u2019, Tubelord signed up to indie\nlabel Hassle Records and released\ntheir debut album \u2018Our First\nAmerican Friends\u2019 in October of\n2009.\nHaving strong roots in pop\nmusic, the trio are set to\nconquer far and wide with their\nalternative power pop, maths\nrock!\n17\nfelix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk MUSIC\nTubelord get cosy at The Borderline\nThis is Tubelord fever as Katie Clemence tells us of their Borderline\ngig and cracks Joe Prendergast like an egg in her refreshing interview\nKC: I\u2019m going to start the interview\non a serious note- what is your favourite dinosaur?\nJP: Um\u2026 got to be triceratops.\nKC: Good choice. Right, so before\nyou decided to wanted to be a musician\nand in a band, what was your ambition\nin life?\nJP: I never decided that, or I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s happening\u2026 my ambition is, um (long pause) to not\u2026 be a\nbricklayer?\nKC: That should be fairly easy then?\nJP: You say that, but it seems to be the\neasiest route to go down\nKC: Well, I\u2019ll be a civil engineer, so I\u2019ll\nknow whether or not you achieve that!\nJP: I\u2019m fine with you bossing me\naround and telling me how to lay\nbricks!\nKC: Okay. So what would you say is\nyour role in the band aside from the instrument you play?\nJP: Well, Dave (drummer) has this\nthing of being really regimental about\neverything, and he says we\u2019re \u2018directors\nof the company\u2019- the band company,\nthat is. So he says I\u2019m artistic director\nand I just go with that. Oh, and I\u2019m the\nabrasive person, I suppose. With Dave.\nKC: Two abrasive people- that\u2019s a\nhell of a lot of abrasion! For the folk at\nImperial who maybe haven\u2019t heard you\nI\nt was a blustery Monday evening\nwhen I went to see Tubelord.\nYou may not have heard their\nmusic, but murmurs about this\nband are spreading, and the rumours are all good. Needless to say,\nthe gig had a lot to prove.\nIt turned out we weren\u2019t on the\nguestlist- a good start to any night.\nFortunately, a combination of good\nlooks and charisma allowed us to blag\nour way in for free. The venue, the\nBorderline, felt like a good place to\nbe even as we entered. The room was\nbuzzing with excited energy, and one\nof the support bands, Tall Ships, were\nalready playing. Grabbing a drink, we\nwere treated to the second half of their\nset. Due to the shape of the room, the\ngig felt very intimate, and Tall Ships\nplayed on this by talking directly to the\naudience, interacting and making everyone feel involved. Their music was\ndreamy and synthy (admittedly like a\nlot of new bands) but the set was also\ngood to watch, with the instrumentalists frequently swapping- playing each\nothers\u2019 instruments and surprising us.\nI think the nicest thing about watching\nthis band was that everybody seemed\nto know the words to the songs, many\nof which were chantlike and easy to\nsing along to. The music encouraged\nan intimacy within the audience, who\nwere a lot friendlier than your standard gig attendees.\nSo Many Dynamos were the next\nsupport band, all the way from St\nLouis, Missouri. I didn\u2019t warm to them\nas much as to Tall Ships, partly because their cyclic, thrumming, dance\nstyle music and the singer\u2019s accent reminded me of when I used to listen to\nWe Are Scientists, who used the same\nkind of repetitive song formats in their\nmusic. On the plus side, the songs\nsounded very polished, even as a live\nperformance- also I was very, very\npleased when I realised this band\u2019s\nname was a palindrome. I hope you\nare too, after you read this and look\nback at their name to check I\u2019m telling\nthe truth.\nSo, on to the main event. Tubelord\nopened the set with the first track\nfrom their album, starting with a mes-merising chant which then explodes\ninto a frenzy of post-hardcore guitar.\nIt was a good start because everybody\nknew the breakdown was coming and\nthe excitement was tangible- I\u2019m pretty sure some of the more bulky males\nwere drooling with the thirst for mosh.\nThis song was a good opener- it\nprepared the audience for the nature\nof Tubelord\u2019s music, which is quick-changing and unpredictable, keeping\nus on our toes and anticipating what\nwas to come next. Tubelord built on\nthe intimacy created by the support\nbands- I was particularly captivated\nby a chant-like sequence during the\nsong, which had me wishing I knew\nthe words. The set continued in this\nwhirlwind fashion and pretty much\neveryone was enjoying themselves,\nespecially the band. Particularly notable was lead guitar/singer Joe Prendergrast\u2019s dancing. I\u2019ll call it a cross\nbetween squat thrusts and doing the\ntwist- he got really into it during the\nmore impassioned guitar solos.\nOne thing that was a bit of a shame\nabout Tubelord\u2019s gig was that it was\nimpossible to dance along to unless you knew the songs really well.\nYou can tell that they have obtained\nlarge amounts of joy from the sheer\nobscurity of the time signatures in\ntheir songs- you can\u2019t simply dance\nin a 1,2,3,4 fashion and, to the ear of\na dance music fan, the songs might\nsound slightly awkward. That\u2019s perfectly okay though, because this music\nis made to be listened to and appreciated for its musical value, and for me\nthat overshadowed the fact that I was\nbobbing around erratically in an attempt to dance.\nThe standout moments from the\ngig were when they played Night of\nPencils (check it out), and the song\nCows to the east, Cities to the West, a\nquiet ballad amongst their many fast-paced songs, with brilliant use of the\nglockenspiel.\nOverall the gig was really enjoyable-The support bands were above aver-age, I got to go backstage, and I got to\nsee Tubelord, who are now one of my\nfavourite new bands.\nKatie Clemence catches Joe Prendergast, lead guitar and vocalist from post-hardcore math rock band\nTubelord, for a sneaky interview one fine Monday evening in a dim alleyway\nbefore, how would you describe the\nsound of your band?\nJP: Ah\u2026 Not very dubstep-ey- we\nhave bumslaps on the album! We have\nbumslaps! Yeah, we do!\nKC: Is that your description of the\nsound then? Bumslaps?\nJP: It literally is! Bumslaps! When we\nwere recording it we thought, ah man,\nif anybody comes in right now, they\u2019re\ngonna be faced with me and Dave bending over with a microphone. It\u2019s in the\nsong \u2018Your bed is kind of frightening\u2019.\nYeah, you can\u2019t quite get it, you sit there\ntrying to clap it with your hands, trying\nto figure it out, but you can\u2019t quite get\nthat clap going. <claps>\nKC: So, you have to spend a lot of\ntime together as a band- has anyone\ngot any odd habits?\nJP: Yeah, Jamie complains about every-thing. Dave constantly talks about need-ingtohaveawank.OhandSamhaswheat\nintolerance!Hejustgetsreallysleepy.And\nhe\u2019s always eating sandwiches!\nKC: Anyway, so the band uses a lot of\ndifferent time signatures so you must\nhave had quite a musical upbringing.\nDid anyone play any hilariously embarrassing instruments when they were\nyounger? Like the piccolo?\nJP: Dave plays viola- he\u2019s been playing it since he was about 4. He should\nbe really awesome- he was playing it\nregimentally for a while. I didn\u2019t have\na musical upbringing. The way it goes\nis, I write a song, Dave goes \u2018you\u2019re a\nbastard, that\u2019s 5 and it should go into 7\nand it doesn\u2019t work\u2019 and I say \u2018I have no\nidea what you\u2019re talking about\u2019.\nKC:So will you tell us why you named\nthe band Tubelord?\nJP: No.\nKC: Is it to do with Youtube?\nJP: Definitely, probably\u2026 no. You\nwere so close!\nKC: Another quick question- do you\nlike pokemon?\nJP: Ahhhh. Yes. I got them into our\nnew song! Join the Abra Kadabra\n<starts singing>\nI like your questions, they\u2019re refreshing!\nKC: What are most questions like?\nInterview me in the style of a generic\ninterview!\nJP: Ok I have a normal question to\nstart with: Noodles or sauce? What are\nthey on about noodles or sauce?!\nKC: Finally, in a battle between Charizard, Venusaur and Blastoise, who\nwould you be backing?\nJP: At first, Blastoise because it begins\nwith a B. Then maybe Venusaur, but\nthen I\u2019d think Charizard\u2019s quite good,\nbut then I wouldn\u2019t want the one that\nAsh has, so probably Venusaur. But\nyeah. Blastoise is good. But who\u2019s to\nsay I told the truth in any part of this\ninterview?\nTubelord\nBorderline\nFebruary\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\n\n"

A\nSingle Man is his\ndirectorial debut\nafter leaving the\nfashion house\nGucci.\nTom Ford, the world-renowned fashion designer most famous for fishing\nGucci out of bankruptcy, steps behind\nthe camera for the first time to create\na work of art, beauty and nostalgia.\nPre-conceptions that can usually arise\nabout a first-time director who used to\nbe a fashion designer \u2013 beautiful cos-tumes, sumptuous music, overdone\nvisuals, good-looking actors \u2013 do make\ntheir standard appearances but with A\nSingle Man, Ford goes a step further,\nexploring social division, prejudice and\nsolitude.\nTold from our leading protagonist\u2019s\npoint of view, George (Colin Firth),\nan English professor in Los Angeles,\nis planning to commit suicide after realising that with the death of his lover\nJim (Matthew Goode), his life is not\nworth living anymore. He has a gun\nprepared, has written all the goodbye\nletters, and has sorted out his finances.\nAll he needs to do is to get through\nthe day, teach his class, have dinner\nwith his close and possibly only friend\nCharley, (Julianne Moore) and then it\u2019s\ngoodbye cruel world.\nBut not everything goes quite according to George\u2019s perfectly laid-out\nplan. An intrigued student Kenny (Ni-cholas Hoult) takes peculiar interest\nin George, an attraction that seems to\ninvolve fascination for both academia\nand sex, and this leads to several,\nlengthy discussions about life and its\nsurrounding moralities. He has curious encounters with a male prostitute,\nCarlos (model Jon Kortajarena), and\nColin Firth takes a look back at his life in a Single Man\nhis neighbours that make him question\nhis decision to end his life.\nGeorge is alone, living as an outcast\nand Ford makes sure that we see this in\nas many different ways as possible. He\u2019s\nan English man living in America, he\u2019s\nall alone in an empty glass house and\nhe\u2019s a gay man living in the 60\u2019s. Firth,\nin the role of his lifetime, gives a magnetic performance and does not falter\nfor one minute. He is quiet, yet subtly\npowerful, perfectly reflecting the character\u2019s on-going grief and frustration\ntowards his empty life that seems to\nhave no hopeful future. The awards\nbuzz is certainly well-deserved.\nThe supporting cast also does an\nequally phenomenal job. Moore is\non faultless form as the sad, alcoholic\nloner who is so miserable that she considers having a fling with George who\nshe knows is gay. She tries to mask her\nfear and worry with endless booze, a\nperfectly decorated house and heavy\nmake-up but in the end nothing lasts\nforever and she\u2019s back to her depressed\nself. Moore captures the struggles\nand weaknesses of her character and\nkeeps up flawless chemistry with Firth.\nGoode finally lands a role where he\ncan put his good looks to fine use as\nGeorge\u2019s young dead lover. George\u2019s\nflashbacks including Jim show how\nhappy and content our protagonist\nwas as a result of this one man and we\ncan all understand why. Their scenes\nare intimate, sweet and at times, quite\ncomical. Hoult, a dedicated student full\nof talking points, intelligent views and\na genuine interest towards George, has\na young, fresh charm that sets a clear\ncontrast between Hoult\u2019s and Firth\u2019s\ncharacters.\nFord dazzles us with his confidence\nin using various visual techniques. His\nbold use of colours showing sharp contrast shows both the grim, grey 60\u2019s, as\nwell as the more detailed, fashionable\ninteriors and atmosphere of the more\nflamboyant, fun-loving characters. His\nfrequent use of zoom-ins skilfully adds\nsomething more erotic and intimate\nto the narrative. Combine that with\nsome slow-motion filming and the effect is doubled. Does he rely on this too\nmuch? Perhaps. But this certainly isn\u2019t\nall style and no substance.\nA Single Man may sound like a complete downer, but under Ford\u2019s steady,\nbeautiful direction and anchored by\nstrong performances from the cast,\nthis goes beyond the sad, tear-jerking\nmessage of loss and tragedy into something more meaningful, exploring life\nand its worth. An emotionally alive\npicture from an ensemble of artistic\ntalent, this moving experience should\nnot be missed.\nThe\nOscars\nBreakdown\nYou might recognise this man, it\u2019s\nNeil Patrick Harris!\nI admit I had to go\non IMDB.com\nto find out he\nis. Apparently\nhe starred\nin Starship\nTroopers,\nremember?\nHis song\nand dance\nroutine was\nan enjoyable start\nto the ceremony.\n[Ed.-IT\u2019SBARNEY]\nAlec Baldwin and Steve Martin literally descended to host the Oscars. Their partnership\nwas a bit hit and miss but some well aimed\nJewish jokes about Inglourious Basterds had\nthe audience in stitches. \u2018The Motherload!\u2019\nSteve Martin exclaimed to the audience.\nPenelope Cruz, looking as gorgeous as\never, presented the\nfirst major award of\nthe ceremony - Best\nSupporting Actorto Christoph Waltz\nfor his brilliant\nperformance in Inglourious Basterds.\nUnfortunately, Tarrantino\u2019s WWII set\nrevenge fantasy\nfailed to pick up\nany other accolades\nit might have justly\ndeserved.\nThe incredibly adorable Zoe Saldana\ncame on stage with Bafta winning and\nOscar nominated British actress Carey\nMulligan to present an award. Best Original Screenplay went to The Hurt Locker\nand Best Foreign Film to The Secret in\nTheir Eyes.\nMo\u2019Nique took the second\nBest Supporting Acting\nstatuette for her intense performance in Precious. Precious also took home the\nAdapted Screenplay\naward as well. We\nthen witnessed\na bizarre dance\nsequence set\nagainst the music of the five\nfilms nominated for\nbest score which\neventually went to\nUp.\nBefore the important awards were revealed we had the annual \u2018in memoriam\n\u2018 slideshow. Fariah Fawcett, one of the\noriginal Charlie\u2019s Angels was controversially left out whereas Michael\nJackson was unusually included\nas he is a musician and not an\nactor. Long overdue an Oscar, Jeff\nBridges was ecstatic in receiving his\nBest Actor award for his tender portrayal of a down and out singer in\nCrazy Heart. Sandra Bullock then took\nto the stage to receive her statuette for\nher first Oscar nomination and win for\nBest Actress. She also received a Razzie\nAward for worst actress.\nWhat was\nfashionable\nin 1961?\nSmoking\nJ.F.K\nElvis\nAs the ceremony drew\nto a close and the clock\nticked towards 5am in\nEngland, the anticipation for the last two\nawards - Best Director and Best Picture\n- rose to a climax. This\nwas not James Cameron\u2019s night and Kathryn Bigelow took two\nOscars home for her\nintense Iraq set war\ndrama The Hurt Locker\nwhich won 6 awards in\ntotal.\n\n"

Green and brown grass\nin the foreground with hills\nproviding the horizon in all\ndirections. Clouds were not a\ncommon occurrence and this day was\nno different. Our journey was nearing\nan end as we were returning to the capi-tal, Ulaanbaatar, to fly back home. Only\nthings had suddenly got a little more\ncomplicated. Our present position involved a lot of mud, which had not been\nvisible before, and a van that was not\ngoing anywhere fast. And did I mention\nthat we were off-road on a two-wheel\ndrive minibus?\nPiling out of the bus to survey our pre-dicament, silence fell as we surrounded\nthe crash site unsure of what to do. Apart\nfrom the clothes and tents we were carrying with us, we had limited resources\nand options. Several phones materialised\nto check for signal but to no avail; who\nwould you call anyway in an exotic country for an accident in the middle of no-where? While we huddled around, help-less, I started to think about the other\nunusual times we had had over the past\nfew weeks.\n\u201cWho would you\ncall anyway in an\nexotic country\nfor an accident\nin the middle of\nnowhere?\u201d\nWe had arrived about three weeks previously with no idea of what to expect. Of\ncourse we had all read the Lonely Planet\nguide on the flight, but being in a new\ncountry was thrill enough that everything we had read flew out the window.\nWe only had two days in Ulaanbaatar\nbefore we needed to catch a train to our\nnext destination. In search of a supermarket for food and supplies we ended up\nfinding out a lot more about the country\nwe were now in. Standing in some sort of\nmarket square next to a main road while\ndeliberating which street to head down\nnext I found myself people-watching. The\nfirst observation was that a lot of people\nseemed to be driving large cars: in a short\nspace of time we saw several Hummers,\nnew Discoveries, and many other four-wheel drive vehicles. It turned out that\npetrol was dirt cheap, something like 12p\nper litre. The second observation was\nmuch more interesting; the pedestrians\nseemed to have no concept of \u2018waiting\u2019.\nA nearby news kiosk had a mob besieging it, every individual jostling to be at the\nfront of the queue. A family crossed the\nroad as soon as they reached the roadside\nwithout hesitation; the mother stepped\nout in front of the cars with her arm outstretched to stop the traffic, while her\nchildren walked casually across without\nbreaking stride.\nOur next glimpse of the local people\ncame about a week later and about 400\nmiles away. This time we were midway\nthrough a five-day horse trek through\nsome foothills and, on such rare occa-sion, we had had glorious sunshine and\nblue skies all day until evening when\nthe heavens had opened and drained\nits sewage. This put a dampener on the\nmood but the cards came out and Texas\nHold\u2019em was the name of the game. The\nevening was going fine but the rain didn\u2019t\nlook like it was going to stop and we had\ndinner to cook \u2013 a laborious process involving lighting a fire (with some very\nwet wood), boiling the river water for a\ncouple of minutes (without the fire going out), and then simmering the food\nfor another 30 minutes while stirring\ncontinuously (in the pouring rain). After a very wet hour and still no success\nwe decided to take a different tact. Some\nlocals nearby very kindly allowed us into\ntheir yurt. Considering they numbered\nseven \u2013 including three generations \u2013\nand us thirteen it was a bit of a squeeze.\n\u201c...the pedestrians\nseemed to have\nno concept of\n\u2018waiting\u2019\u201d\nWe cooked on their stove and ate inside,\nprobably making everything they owned\nvery moist in the process. We were eternally grateful, being very hungry by this\ntime, and I think they found the whole\nsituation mildly amusing. Still very wet,\nbut now much warmer and with appeased stomachs, we returned to our\ntents for some well deserved rest.\nAnother ten days or so later we wandered into a seemingly empty town as\ndusk began to fall. We knew where we\nwere going but the emptiness was still a\nlittle unnerving. We had just completed\na 100 mile walk over the course of 5 days,\nwe all had blisters, we all smelt pretty bad\n(maybe that was the reason for the poor\nwelcoming committee) and we were\nall too tired to care about anything but\nsleep. We had arranged beforehand to\nstay at the local school that was closed\nfor the summer holidays. Twelve hours\nof deep and dreamless sleep later we\nwoke up. The town had clearly been up\nfor some time already. People were every-where, children playing football in what\nseemed to be the \u2018main road\u2019, the elderly\nstanding and sitting on front porches,\nwhile the middle-aged wandered through\nthe market that was seemingly raised out\nof the nothingness of the school\u2019s play-grounds. These were people who were\nmuch less accustomed to visitors, and\nthis became increasingly apparent as\nwe drew attention to ourselves. Many of\nthem spoke no English and as a group we\nwere linguistically ignorant as well, but\nwe didn\u2019t need to understand them to see\nthe gestures and glances being thrown in\nour direction. Soon there was a throng of\neager faces around us, the women trying\nto sell handmade necklaces, the children\nwanting us to join them in a game of foot-ball. They were far too polite to reach out\nand grab us, but with an almost choreographed motion we were separated into\nthose most likely to spend money, and\nthose looking eager to play a game we rec-ognised. It quickly became apparent that\nthey were experienced in communicating\nwith visitors; enough English to negotiate\nprices and, where necessary, exchange\nMy Mongolian misadventures\nA trip to somewhere a little different? Peter Mason brings tales from the remote corners of Mongolia\nrates, as well as a pretty accurate idea of\nwhat a \u2018typical tourist\u2019 would pay for their\ncommodities. We learned from some of\nthose with better English that the town\nsaw at least a few visitors every couple of\nweeks, and that the school was a popular resting place for travellers during the\nsummer.\nA few days later we left that town, heading in the direction of civilisation again\nwith the impression that our long journey\nwas now approaching an end. We hired a\ncouple of minivans to transport us without our bags on the roof and set off on the\nthree-day drive across the countryside.\nUnder normal circumstances, the other minivan would have driven back to a\ntown we passed earlier in the day for help.\nUnfortunately, as we approached the\n\u201cThese were people\nwho were much\nless accustomed to\nvisitors, and this\nbecame increasingly\napparent as we\ndrew attention to\nourselves\u201d\ntown the local radio station broadcast a\nwarning: the town had been quarantined\nto prevent the outbreak of something\nwhose description we never managed\nto translate. Undefeated, we found a few\npieces of wood and some ingenious ideas\nand, between the lever technique and\nthe other minivan towing from behind,\nwe eventually broke free. Sitting on the\ngrass around the crash site, it was clear\nwhy the driver had been unable to avoid\nthe accident \u2013 there had been no sign of\nthe patch of ground being any different to\nthe next. When we left it looked like we\nhad taken a bath in it, and to look at some\nof us, that might not have been a poor\nassumption.\n\n"

Dr Steve\nMyers of CERN told the\nBBC that the collider\nwill close at the end of\n2011. \u201cIt\u2019s something\nthat, with a lot more\nresources and with a lot more manpower and quality\ncontrol, possibly could have been avoided but I have\ndifficulty in thinking that this is something that was a\ndesign error,\u201d he said. The collider is expected to reach\nworld record power later this month at a power of 7 trillion electron volts (TeV), as it attempts to replicate the\nconditions from the begining of the universe.\nFor the first time, ancient DNA has been exctracted from the\nfossilised eggshells of birds, from which it is hoped that information will be extracted as to their physiology, diet, and\nalso how they went extinct. DNA has been collected from\nfossilised eggshells of birds that died thousands of years ago,\nthe oldest being that of an Australian emu that died around\n19000 years ago. This is the first time that scientists have suc-ceeeded in extracting ancient DNA from fossilised eggshells.\nA technique called confocal microscopy was used which\nenabled researchers to see exactly where the DNA is located\ninside the eggshells. It is then hoped that he total DNA makeup of an organism (the genome) could then be extracted and\nsequenced. Eggshells from both the Little Bush Moa and the\nHeavy Footed Moa were estimated to be older than 3000\nyears, but attempts to collect DNA from a 50,000 year old\nflightless bird failed due to excess degradation.\nIn\nbrief\nLHC to shut down DNA from extinction? City moved by 10 feet\nThe most expensive substance ever\nproduced by mankind - antimatter -will be easier to make in the future. All\nit takes is a short-pulse laser and some\ngold.\n'Antimatter' certainly has a mysterious ring to it - no wonder it's a popular\ntheme in science fiction. In \"Star Trek\",\nit is antimatter that powers the space\ncrafts, and in Dan Brown's recent bestseller \"Angels and Demons\", antimatter\nis stolen from CERN in order to create\na bomb that can destroy the Vatican.\nBut antimatter is not just science\nfiction; it actually is being produced\nin small quantities at laboratories like\nCERN, using huge particle accelera-tors. It is claimed to be the most expensive material ever produced, with\nan estimated cost ranging from 25 billion up to 60 trillion USD per gram,\ndepending on the type of antimatter\ncreated.\nWhat researchers have been waiting\nfor is a cheap, simple method of producing greater quantities of it - and\nthey may not have to wait long. Last\nyear, a research team from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\nin California was successful in creating a large number of antiparticles by\nsimply shooting a laser through a gold\nfoil. And by improving their method,\nthis year the team is hoping to create\neven more.\nAntimatter is composed of antipar-ticles, in the same way that normal\nmatter is made up of particles. Antiparticles are simply regular particles\nwith an opposite charge. The positron,\nfor instance, is the antimatter companion of the electron. But, as soon as an\nantimatter particle comes into contact\nwith a regular particle, they are converted into pure-energy radiation in a\nprocess called annihilation.\nThe Livermore researchers discovered that, when shooting a short-pulse\nlaser through a millimetre-thick gold\nfoil, electrons from the material are re-leased. The laser accelerates the electrons so they move around at very high\nenergies, colliding with the particles in\nthe foil.\nThe collisions cause the electrons to\nlose energy, which is given off as ra-diation. In the end, this radiation gets\ntransformed into positron-electron\npairs due to interaction with the gold\nnuclei. This process is simply the reverse of annihilation, and is called pair\nproduction. In that way, over 100 billion positrons are created using simple\nlaboratory tools. \"This is far more than\nhas ever been detected in laser experiments before,\" says Hui Chen, the\nLivermore physicist leading the team.\nIn order to detect the antimatter par-ticles, the researchers used a regular\nelectron detector. Since positrons are\njust electrons with an opposite charge,\nthe detector could easily be converted\nto register them.\nThe results of the measurements\nwere published in The Physical Review\nLetters last year. This year, the team\nis hoping to create even more posi-trons: a second measurement using a\nslightly different experimental setup is\nunderway.\nVery little antimatter has been created in the laboratory so far. In fact, even\nif all the antimatter that has ever been\nproduced in accelerators around the\nworld were annihilated with normal\nmatter, the released energy couldn't\neven power a light bulb for a day.\nMore is certainly needed - scientists\nthink that antimatter may even have\npractical uses, for example in the future in astrophysics and medicine. Another possibility further down the line\nis to create a gamma-ray laser based on\nthe induced annihilation of electron-positron pairs.\nAntimatter researchers face fascinating challenges. The universe, as we\nknow it, is composed of far more matter than antimatter. This is very puz-zling, since current theory says the two\nshould have been almost equally abundant at the time of the Big Bang. But if\nthat is true - why didn't all particles annihilate each other immediately in the\nearly universe?\nScientists have speculated on the\ncauses of this so-called asymmetry\nsince it was first discovered, but it has\nremained one of the greatest mysteries\nin physics to date. Peter Beiersdorfer,\na Livermore physicist working with\nChen, has high hopes about the ex-periment's use in understanding the\nasymmetry: \"By creating this much\nantimatter, we can study in more detail\nwhether antimatter really is just like\nmatter, and perhaps gain more clues as\nto why the universe we see has more\nmatter than antimatter\".\nHopefully, the upcoming Livermore\nexperiment will produce more antimatter particles than the previous\none, and offer deeper insights into the\nasymmetry problem. It seems that in\norder to understand the matter from\nwhich we emerged, antimatter really\nmatters.\nThe unusual shape of so-called dwarf\ngalaxies has long been a mystery to\ndark-matter cosmology. But research\nrecently published in Nature has now\nrevealed the missing piece of the puz-zle: exploding stars.\nThe star-studded sky may look daz-zling, but most of it is composed of\ninvisible matter. A successful theory of\ncosmology, known as the \u201cCold Dark\nMatter (CDM) model\u201d, states that 85%\nof the universe\u2019s mass is made up of\nan invisible, cold, and unknown substance called 'dark matter'.\nAccording to CDM theory, a galaxy\ntypically forms as a spinning halo of\ndark matter pulls in surrounding material to its core - resulting in a bulge\nof stars and dark matter at the galactic\ncentre. But dwarf galaxies lack such a\nlump, and have for this reason posed a\nthreat to the theory.\n\u201cIt was definitely a red alert kind of\nthreat,\u201d explains Fabio Governato of\nthe University of Washington. \u201cThe\ninability of the [CDM] model to reproduce the properties of dwarf galaxies might have required changing\nNewtonian gravity [\u2026] or required different properties for the dark-matter\ncandidate.\u201d\nExploding stars\nthrow new light on\ndark matter\nAntimatter research\nstrikes gold this time\n3D map of the large-scale distrbution of dark matter in the observable universe\nMiriam Frankel\nMiriam Frankel In the end, it was exploding stars\n- supernovas - that saved the day for\ncosmology. Governato\u2019s research team\nshowed that winds generated by supernovas near the center of a dwarf galaxy\ncan \u2018push out\u2019 the matter surrounding\nit. When this effect was added to the\nCDM model, super-computer simulations could finally predict the shape of\ndwarf galaxies.\nSupernovas cannot, however, disturb\nthe massive centers of large galaxies.\nDwarf galaxies are different because\nthey have such a low mass - their gravitational pull can't overcome the outward flow of matter generated by the\nsupernova winds.\nThe new computer model has successfully matched several observations\nof dwarf galaxies. \u201cThe ability to match\nmultiple observations is a crucial test\nof models such as ours, and gives us\nmuch confidence in our results\u201d says\nChris Brooks of University of Central\nLancashire, UK, who was part of the\nresearch team.\nThe next challenge for the team is to\nuse the model to more accurately reproduce bigger galaxies, such as our\nown Milky Way.\nIt looks like scientists may still be in\nthe dark concerning the nature of dark\nmatter - but at least they are now more\nconvinced of its existence.\n\n"

Many\nathletes prepare for a training session by carrying out some routine stretching exercises, but\nit\u2019s important to remember that stretching helps\nto improve your static flexibility and may not do\nsuch a good job at preparing your body to move\nquickly and efficiently. Therefore, dynamic mobility exercises during your pre-workout warm up\nwill prepare your body for vigorous movements.\nMost sports involve forceful, strenuous activity\nand mobility exercises stimulate your nervous sys-tem, muscles, tendons & joints in a very dynamic\nmanner. Examples of these would be; half squats,\nside bends, ankle bounces & leg swings. A well prepared warm up session not only prepares the body\nphysically, but also physiologically.\nThe warm up also plays a major part at preparing\nyou psychologically. A well organised team, feeling\nconfident knowing that you have had the time to\nphysically & psychologically prepare, focusing on\nyour individual role, will play a major part in the\noutcome of the game. From the perspective of the\nopposition a well organised looking warm-up session can have already placed negative thoughts and\nenergy, leaving them feeling defeated before the\ngame has even begun.\nA pre-competition meal is an important part\nof your preparation, however so is what you eat\na week before! You should fill up your Glycogen\nstores, so you begin your competition with a full\nfuel supply! On the morning of your competition,\nyou should focus on a meal high in Carbohydrate,\nlow in fat, protein and fibre. Complex carbohydrates release energy slowly. Examples of these\nwould be: wholegrain breakfast cereals, boiled rice,\nsweet potatoes & boiled pasta. Avoid simple carbs\nas these release energy quicker, but produce insulin,\nso therefore making you feel tired slowly. Examples\nof these would be; muesli bars, cakes & biscuits, ce-reals, puddings and soft drinks.\nMake sure you are well hydrated before the competition having your last drink around 15-20 minutes before you start, drinking at regular intervals\nthroughout the game.\nDepletion of the body\u2019s carbohydrate stores and\ndehydration are two factors that will limit prolonged exercise. The recommendation of sports\ndrinks is based on a number of factors like the type\nof sport the person is engaged in, its intensity and\nduration, athlete\u2019s nutritional status and many\nmore. Commercial sports drinks that are hitting the\nmarket primarily consist of water, carbohydrate,\nand electrolytes (sodium, chloride, and potassium).\nThe need for sports drink nutrition also depends\nupon the athlete\u2019s dehydration status. There are\nsports that cause heavy loss of fluids and it is there\nwhere these sports drinks play a major role, preventing your body from getting dehydrated. Performance levels also tend to get adversely affected,\nowing to the depletion of the body\u2019s carbohydrate\nstores and dehydration, which takes place while\ncarrying out sporting activities.\nWhen sweating takes place during the performance of sports, it tends to cause loss of fluids and\nelectrolytes (minerals such as chloride, calcium,\nphosphate, magnesium, sodium and potassium),\ntherefore making the body dehydrated.\nDehydration if not taken care of, can take an\nugly shape by causing circulatory collapse and heat\nstroke. This is where the benefits of a sports drink\ncan be very well applied. When the fluid loss takes\nplace in the body, it leads to impaired performance\nand the capacity for performing muscular work also\ndeteriorates. Therefore, these sports drinks definitely aid in improving the performance level of an\nathlete, by acting as energy booster.\nTo make your Varsity day a winning one, make\nsure you prepare yourself not just on the day, but\nahead of time. As mentioned, it is important to focus on what you eat, not just on the day, but a week\nbefore too! Start mentally preparing yourself during warm-up sessions & focusing on your individual\nrole.\nA well organised team is a winning one!\n\n"

There\u2019s\nabout four pounds worth of food and\ndrink on the table, and I\u2019m going to\nthrow it away. The couple who were\nsitting here before me were planning\nsome grand trip out to Vietnam, talking about how badly they needed the\nbreak and how it would do them good.\nI\u2019m feeling quite tired of people today.\nMoreso than usual, I mean.\nIt\u2019s no secret \u2013 insofar as a man who\nwrites behind a pen name every week\ncan have things that aren\u2019t secrets \u2013\nthat I dislike people with more money\nthan sense. I find it hard to relate to\npeople who come to one of the finest\nscientific institutions on the planet\nmerely because they want a penthouse flat and a Mercedes one day. I\ncan relate to people wanting more of\nthings, or a good life for themselves,\nbut over time it becomes more and\nmore obvious to me that most people\nare here for one thing and one thing\nonly \u2013 themselves.\nI read the superb and entertaining\nLogicomix a few months back - it\u2019s a\ncomic book charting the life of Bertrand Russell, his forays into mathematics and logic, as well as providing a discussion about scientists and\nthe passion that drives them. Almost\nevery academic that I\u2019ve met at Imperial, at PhD level or higher, has some\nequivalent of that drive within them.\nI can\u2019t say I do all the time. That\u2019s\njust not true. Only the other day I was\ncarving \u201cNEWTON IS A BASTARD\u201d\non my arm with a rusty biro, and I can\nfrequently be seen outside the Science\nMuseum holding a plank of wood with\na nail in it. I don\u2019t like science all the\ntime.\nBut I can\u2019t imagine coming here and\nnot really caring for it at all. I can\u2019t\nimagine waking up every day, walking\nthrough the corridors of Imperial and\nnot feeling like you\u2019re part of something that\u2019s more than a payroll system.\nYet I\u2019m amazed at how many people\ndo just that \u2013 how many people who,\nupon graduating, will go straight into\na job in consultancy, or finance, or trot\nover to a business school somewhere\nelse in the city. I know people who\nwill graduate and enter a job earning\nthree times what a PhD student earns.\nThey\u2019ll walk into Starbucks, order a\nload of food even though they don\u2019t\nfeel hungry, and plan ways to excrete\nall the money that pads out their body\ninstead of a soul.\nLong-term readers might remember\nthe death of my grandfather a while\nback. In the time since then, my father\nhas followed suit into the grave. The\nold man was an interesting guy. He\nhad one GCSE, and did the same job\nfor all forty years of his working life.\nHe drove me through my time at Imperial with constant encouragement,\ninquisitiveness and passion. Despite\nhaving no contact with any form of\nscience since he was a teenager, he felt\na sense of pride when I spoke to him\nabout what I did. He saw Imperial as\nI do \u2013 as a place where people go to\ndo something more than nine-to-five.\nWhilst writing this, a few of the\nmore cretinous students from my\ncourse have staggered in, ordered the\nmanliest coffees they could think of,\nand are sitting loudly sharing stories\nabout interviews and contacts and\ntheir glorious futures. I can think of\nat least four or five passionate, intelligent students who have been thrown\nout on the street in the last twelve\nmonths because they couldn\u2019t find the\nmoney to continue their studies. The\ntestosterone party being thrown just\na few tables away from me will collectively earn more money in the first\nfew years of their working lives than\nthose students will throughout their\nentire existence.\nThis column is supposed to entertain you. I try to summon up as much\nbile and venom as I can every week\nin the hope that I\u2019ll make my analogies offensive enough to raise a smile\nwhen you\u2019re sitting in the JCR. But\nsome weeks the bile rises up a bit too\nfar and I catch myself in it too. When\nthey got the blues in the fifties, they\u2019d\ncrack out a harmonica or something\ntwee like that. I think I might visit\nSkempton and knock up a few smoke-bombs for next week\u2019s Goldman talks\ninstead.\nAngryGeekisn\u2019talwaysinlovewithscience\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine\nwaking up\neveryday, walking\nthrough the\ncorridors of\nImperial and not\nfeeling like you\u2019re\npart of something\u201d\nS\no we save \u00a369 a month by not\ntaking the tube. We\u2019re always\nfive minutes late, our hair is\nalways poking in strange di-rections, and we wear neon\njackets when there isn\u2019t a Klaxon in\nsight. The rain doesn\u2019t scare us; we just\ncarry a plastic bag and a spare pair of\nsocks. And, oh, don\u2019t sit there; I need\nthat seat for my helmet. Half term is\nno longer a crush in South Kensington\ntube but a clear road, we get excited\nby gears and merino wool and the\nboys can wear leggings without being\nlaughed at.\nAs I exited Hyde Park last week,\nlaughing at the queue of four-by-fours\ntrying to do the same thing but with\ninfinitely less style and a huge carbon\nfootprint, I felt pretty good. I wasn\u2019t\nburning fossil fuels, I hadn\u2019t had to sit\nnext to someone eating an Egg McMuffin, and in minutes I was going\nto be safely inside Imperial. My poor\nbicycle was going to be left to face the\nelements whilst I dried off and carried\non with the day, terrified of the window and the clouds outside.\nI saw the police car before I ran the\n\u2018red\u2019. Sure, it was a traffic signal, one\nthat I chose to fail to comply with. But\nI made it! I was on Exhibition Road,\nsinging \u2018You Got The Love\u2019 (this is the\nonly line I know) and I was going to\nbe early for labs. Oh no, the car behind me is next to me. What a \u2026 \u201cErrr,\ncould you just pull over miss\u201d. Are..\nyou..joking? It was raining badly now,\nand although I was only a road away\nfrom essentially a sauna (to my runny\nnosed imagination at least) I felt like I\nwas miles away. Actually, I thought we\nwere going to go down to the station.\nTerrified, I explained my case. I\nwas trying to avoid the cars. I was\ntrying to keep everyone safe, me, the\ndrivers, the dog walkers, the horse\nriders. No, I didn\u2019t see the other cyclists waiting. No, I didn\u2019t catch the\nBBC expose that morning on the\nlycra louts ruining our capital. I was\nputting on an anorak and tucking my\nthermals into my waterproof trou-sers, sorry.\nWhat a fine error that was. He took\nmy Imperial ID card out of my rucksack cover for me, my skiing gloves\nhaving the dual features of making me\nlook like a hit man and radically reducing the use of my fingers. He took\nmy address (every single respectable\nadult I\u2019ve told since has said I should\nhave lied) and left me in the gutter, to\nget covered with the grime of SW7\nand a nice pair of waterlogged socks. I\nwatched him pull away, \u00a330 better off,\nstaring at his sat nav, on the look out\nfor his next prey. He probably has us\nall tagged.\nIt was a very slow journey home.\nJessWadegetspulledbythepolice...Why?\n\u201cTerrified, I\nexplained my case.\nI was trying to\navoid the cars. I\nwas trying to keep\neveryone safe\u201d\n\n"

You\nmay think that with what little clothing she wears there\u2019s not much style in\nquestion. You have to look outside the\ntabloid images of Rihanna.\nHer screen persona is hard and\nfierce. An alter-ego as a result of being\na victim of domestic violence. She has\ncome a long way since her girl-next-choice of using British designer Bryce\nAime\u2019s spikey T-Rex top from her CSM\ngraduate collection has received national newspaper coverage.\nShe does no fashion faux pas when it\ncomes to accessorising. The fuschia bra\nunder a knit top is a calculated move\nto add an edge to a comfy outfit. Her\nshades aren\u2019t RayBan. They are status glasses from Grey Ant, Beyonce is\nalso a fan. Nothing about Rihanna is\nthe norm, she wore a pair of laced lens\nglasses by A-Morir to spice up a Jasmine di Milo sequin playsuit. Russian\nRoulette? Not a game Rihanna plays\nwhen it comes to fashion.\nGareth Pugh\nThePugh womanthistimeisatoughfu-turistic soldier, uncompromising, cold.\nChevrons all point to the face with the\nmodels wearing deadpan expressions\nand a dark aura above the brows. Models were tucked and bound into leather\nboots and highly structured chevron\npadded jackets. The show culminated\nin a floor-length frock that drew 20s reference and decorated silver chains that\nsway as you walk.\nGiles Deacon\nAnother British crown jewel \u2013 Giles\nDeacon \u2013 also shows in Paris. Giles\ncontinued to exact the subtle decorations in his designs, this time with\ncloud like edges. The clothes are girly\nand in a fluro, as well as candy-floss,\npalette. Mildly 60s influenced and\nmany bra top tu-tu dresses. Bags take\ncentre stage - from last season\u2019s dinosaur bags to this Totoro\u2019s soot ball!\nCute and huggable ball of desire!\nTalbot Runhof\nJohnny Talbot and Adrian Runhof have\ncreated a gothic-but-cute collection\nwith brocade fabric and tulle material that the duo became adept at using\nafter designing for the Dortmund Opera House. Ruffled layers of tulle were\nstrengthen and made the complex\nstructure of the finale dress possible.\nWhat are the boot holders doing tho?\nBalenciaga\nWithout a doubt Nicolas Ghesquiere,\nthe house\u2019s creative director, has renovated the legendary house. A futuristic theme connects last season to this.\nWhile many houses played it safe, Balenciaga became the only house that\nbraved novel silhouettes - box shape,\nwith bulky arms and straight waist;\nsports style cinched waist. But how\nwearable, really, is a bullet-proof style\njacket?\nDo you know...\nthat Nicolas Ghesquiere has shown\nthe red card to Carine Roitfeld and\nher team, the ever so lovely editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris. Balenciaga has\nrefused to lend anymore clothes to\nthe magazine as well as withdrawing\nall advertisement. WWD asked Carine to elaborate, she replied, \u2018We\u2019re\nblacklisted. It\u2019s too bad, it\u2019s a beautiful\nhouse and it\u2019s French. I hope that it\u2019s\nnot forever.\u2019\nGiambettista Valli\nA collection of what Giambattista\ndoes best: 1.Turning women into\nbeautiful swans with tulle ruffles 2.\nGiving young women this jaunty frivolity in floaty silk 3. Producing show-stopping red carpet contenders. The\nfinal exit saw a black mermaid in a\ndinner jacket and a see-through bra.\nThe dress, made entirely of black\nfeathers. My heart just stopped.\nGivenchy\nUndoubtedly wearable, silhouettes\nthat will most certainly inspire Zara\u2019s\nin-house designers. Collection consistency is out of the window, as a few\npieces emulate Maison Martin Margiela; a few look similar to the mosaic\nmotif used in last season\u2019s Balenciaga.\nA few even incorporated the Imperial China\u2019s underwear look, with what\nlooks like the traditional paper cutting\ntechnique. If you\u2019re taking anything\nhome, take the minimalist peacoats in\nscarlet, shiny gloves in patent leather.\nYves Saint Laurent\nNuns walking out of a nunnery on a\nrainy day, in PVC capes and a goldie-looking chain with a YSL silhouette. A\npure and fervent YSL look, and a pair of\narm length fuschia gloves is hidden beneath the angelic white cape. Catholicity is gradually replaced by a burst of\ncolours, blue satin, bright green and\nsea urchin yellow. All very elegantly\ndone indeed, as you can expect from\nthe house of Yves Saint Laurent. Models are all Caucasian, as you can expect\nfrom the \u2018eugenicist\u2019 Stefano Pilati.\nCeline\nCreative director Phoebe Philo has\nsent the fashion world into a tweeting\nfrenzie. \u2018Want want want\u2019, \u2018love love\nlove\u2019 \u2013 all lustrous adjectives were used\nin multiples of three. What she\u2019s really done was to have a nip here, a tuck\nthere. A traditional peacoat is given an\nunusual opening , a turtle neck is given\na roll up, a sheepskin cloak is given a\ngold buckle. The clothes aren\u2019t earth-shattering but combining comfort and\nthat edgy chic; words cannot describe\nthe genius of the whole experience.\nHermes\nThe French firm - which is more re-nouned for its Birkin bag now than\nthe silk scarves that once propelled it\nto fame - has come up with a new way\nto generate a new set avid followers.\nMini birkins that can fit a BlackBerry,\na few coins and not much more are set\nto become one of the hottest bags on\nearth. The collection draws reference\nto Margritte\u2019s Son of a Man. Models\ndon leather suits and bowler hats.\nShould there be more female bankers\nin the boardroom?\nThe month long fashion marathon has finally come to an end. Spanning half the globe, the fashion packs finally\narrived in Paris, the city of glamour. Kawai Wong counts the pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter collections that open eyes.\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk FASHION\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering has come under heavy criticism this week after it\nwas revealed that its students were\nforbidden from participating in a col-lege-wide questionnaire. Taught postgraduate students were not allowed to\ntake part in the online survey MOLE\n(Master\u2019s Online Evaluation) during\nthe 2009 Autumn Term. In addition to\nthis, it has also been shown that the department declined the opportunity to\nsend results from TOLE (Tutorial Online Evaluation) to personal tutors, the\nintended subjects of the survey.\nMOLE and TOLE, which both run for\nthe first time during the Autumn Term\nof 2009, have been designed to collate the opinions of students regarding\neducational aspects of university life\nand, in doing so, improve the quality of\nteaching across the college. MOLE includes questions for taught postgraduate students to answer anonymously,\nrelating to the content of course modules and the quality of lecturers them-selves, alongside the relevance and\ntimeliness of coursework feedback.\nThis survey is identical in questions\nand format to SOLE (Student Online\nEvaluation), another newly introduced\nsurvey which represents the undergraduate students of Imperial College.\nTOLE questions undergraduate participants on the quality of their per-Matt Colvin\nMatt Colvin\nCiv Eng Dept defy College with MOLE\nsonal tutors and tutorials in general.\nThe results from TOLE, again anony-mous, are typically sent to the individual members of staff concerned so that\nthey can efficiently receive feedback\nand respond accordingly to it.\nThe Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering has stated that the\nsurveys, recently rewritten by College\nstatisticians in order to improve valid-ity, are \u201cstatistically invalid\u201d, and have\ninsisted that their own teaching survey is of better quality and statistical\nrelevance. Professor Susan Eisenbach,\nDean of Learning and Teaching, informed the department when they announced their plans that if MOLE was\nnot implemented then at the very least\ntheir own survey questions and subsequent results must be sent to College\nRegistry. This was requested in order\nto ensure that the department was\ncomplying with basic quality assurance\nprocedures. The department has, as of\nyet, not satisfied this wish and with\nonly a short period of time until the\nnext Spring Term session of surveys\ncommence, it is widely acknowledged\nthat the likelihood of this happening is\nsmall.\nThe issue has raised some concerns\nregarding the representation and welfare of students in the department.\nJonathan Silver, the current ICU Deputy President (Education), believes that\nthe department\u2019s refusal to cooperate\nwith the college has several \u201cnegative\nimplications\u201d for students and staff\nalike, stating that, \u201c[The Department\nof Civil and Environmental Engineering] think they\u2019re too special to allow their students to do the Autumn\nTerm\u2019s MOLE\u201d. Elaborating on the department\u2019s choice of gravitating away\nfrom the use of college surveys, Mr.\nSilver claims that, \u201cthis disenfranchises the students, who miss out on the\nmost important way of giving teaching\nfeedback, and disenfranchises the staff,\nwho will be at a great disadvantage\nwhen applying for promotion, without\nthe survey evidence of being a good\nlecturer.\u201d Also discussing the issues\nsurrounding TOLE, Mr. Silver comments that \u2018there is little or no point\nin the survey at all if the results never\ncome back\u2019.\nThe Autumn Term 2009 MOLE survey\nsaw a 35% turnout of taught postgraduates across the college departments,\nexcluding Civil and Environmental\nEngineering, while the Autumn Term\n2009 TOLE saw 44% of undergraduates across Imperial College as a whole\ntake part. Civil and Environmental\nEngineering in fact had an above average turnout for TOLE with 47% of its\nundergraduate population (equating\nto 178 students) providing opinions on\ntutorials, yet with these results never\nreaching the intended targets. This\nrenders a significant aim of TOLE in-effectual; the aim of communication\nwith staff and subsequent evaluation\nand improvement within the depart-ment. Although the main areas of\nconcern that surfaced from the results\nwere found to be in the departments of\nChemistry and Chemical Engineering,\nMr. Silver states that, \u201cit\u2019s still a great\nshame that the feedback never got [to\npersonal tutors]\u201d.\nDespite the unwillingness of the Department of Civil and Environmental\nEngineering to participate in MOLE,\ndiscussions are ongoing between Professor Eisenbach and Professor David\nNethercot, the head of the department\nin question, with regards as to whether\nthe department will consider taking\nthe opportunity to participate in the\nSpring Term 2010 MOLE, which is\ncurrently scheduled to take place during the remaining two weeks of this\nterm. It remains to be seen whether the\ndepartment will continue to rely solely\non itself in order to gauge the satisfaction levels of its taught postgradu-ates, and whether it will continue to\nrestrict feedback from undergraduate\nstudents.\nThe Skempton Building, where them rebellious Civil Engineers are rising against College\u2019s barbaric MOLE ruling\nBenjamin Stubbens, a candidate for the\nDeputy President (Education)(DPE)\nposition has officially withdrawn from\nthe Sabbatical Elections 2010.

His withdrawal leaves Meera Ganeshadevan\nunopposed for the DPE role.\nStubbens was unapologetic as he announced his withdrawal to felix.\n\u201cSo, it turns out Rolls Royce want to\noffer me a job. In such a turbulent time\nin the graduate job market I took a decision at the beginning of this year that\nif I did get any decent offer from any\ndecent company with any decent reputation I would be crazy to turn it down.\nI hate to tell you that I am indeed not\ncrazy and will be accepting this job,\u201d he\nexplained.\nSome may see him as turning his\nback on the Union, but he explains that\nthe guarantee of securing a future for\nhimself was too much of a temptation\nwhen pitted against the uncertainty\nof winning the sabbatical position for\nDeputy President (Education).\n\u201cAlthough I want to work as a sabb\nin the union making real changes to\nstudents\u2019 experiences throughout their\ntime in uni, the job on offer is in the\nexact area I want to work, and at the\nend of the day I have to be selfish and\ndo what\u2019s right for me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve already made a\nbig difference to many students in the\nFaculty of Engineering, but especially\nthe Aeronautics Department where\nI\u2019ve whinged and moaned for far too\nlong! I know that I was more than\nqualified to take on this role and know\nthat I would have made a lot of positive\nchanges to the way students are represented throughout IC,\u201d he continued.\nRegarding the rest of the election,\nhe warned that \u201cthe role of DPE is no\nplace for amateurs.\u201d\nNow Stubbens has officially withdrawn his name from the elections, he\nhas put his support behind the RON\ncampaign.\nHe continues: \u201cThat is why I would\nencourage you all (well, at least those of\nyou who haven\u2019t voted yet) as strongly\nas I can to vote RON and re-open nominations for the summer term. This way,\nstudents who actually care and will\nmake a difference can have the opportunity to run.

Nevertheless I have been continuing with my layout duties and making\nsure that our writers are being sorted\nout with free tickets to plays and galleries so that they can review them for\nour reading pleasure.\nWhile my writing may have taken\na back seat these last few months to\nmake time for a course I have actually\npaid for, I have still been getting my\nregular cultural exercise, albeit predominantly from the comfort of my\ncouch: reading!\nMy latest obsession at the moment\nis Russian literature. I think people\nare either ignorant of what the Ruskis\nhave to offer or else they are put off by\nthe sheer size of stalwarts such as War\nand Peace. While Tolstoy\u2019s most famous work is still sitting unopened on\nmy bookshelf, I have devoured Cancer\nWard by Solzhenistyn and Crime and\nPunishment by Dostoevsky already\nthis year and I can not overemphasise\njust how spectacular the latter is. Yes,\nit is deep and dark and brooding- a tale\ngiving an account of the psychological workings of a half crazed, impoverished student as he plans, executes\nand deals with the consequences of a\nmurder. I read it in under a week, so\ngripping it was.\nMost of my equally over-worked\npeers lament the fact that they no\nlonger have time to indulge in reading other than that for dissertations\nand essays, but when one manages to\nfind the time, once realises how beneficial it is to give ones eyes a rest from\nstaring endlessly at computer screens.\nSo please send us your book reviews\nof anything you may have read, highbrow or not.\nBefore you go on to enjoy this week\u2019s\narts section I would like to offer a humble and profuse apology to Bernard\nPereira who wrote an excellent review\nof the Donmar Wrehouse\u2019s Seranading Louie for Friday 26th February\u2019s\nfelix. Due to a mix up, the review\noriginally stated that it was I who had\nwritten it, but it was, in fact, Bernard.\nApologies Bernard. Keep writing!\nNever too cold\nfor culture!\nCazKnight\nCazKnight Arts Editor\nI\nmperial College Union\u2019s annual\nFestival of the Arts, or \u201cArtsfest\u201d,\nis an event that seems to pass\nmuch of the student body by.\nAfter all, Imperial is a collection\nof engineers and scientists who spend\ntheir days in dark labs or huddled over\na keyboard or fiddling about in a work-shop; why should such brilliant minds\nbother themselves with such trifling\nnonsense as music, dance and drama,\nand lower themselves to the level of an\narts student (hack, spit).\nPerhaps it\u2019s such a misguided attitude\nthat meant that the Artsfest Showcase\nconcert, in the Great Hall last Thursday, saw such a disappointing turnout.\nWith enough seating for over 500, less\nthan 20% of which had bums on seats,\nthe ratio of participants to audience\nwas close to 1:1. There\u2019s some Maths\nfor those of you who somehow prefer\nPythagoras to Puccini.\nThe concert, for the bargainous ticket price of a fiver, gave a platform for a\nbroad range of the Union\u2019s arts clubs\nand societies to show what they were\nall about. These students, bucking the\naforementioned trend, showed exactly\nwhy arts at Imperial are worth your\ntime and interest with a showcase that\nhad something for everyone and demonstrated a flair for creativity in their\nroutines, arrangements and artistic\ndecisions.\nFrom the orchestral and instrumental camp, we had offerings from Imperial College String Ensemble (ICSE),\nWindband and Classical Guitar. ICSE\ndemonstrated exactly how an ensemble adept at classical music can appeal to an audience of geeks by taking us through a fun medley of retro\nvideo game tracks including Zelda,\nPok\u00e9mon, Tetris and Mario. Windband appealed to the movie buffs with\na beautiful, spine-tingling arrangement from Pirates of the Caribbean,\nperfectly conducted by Gilly French.\nClassical Guitar\u2019s piece, imaginatively\nentitled \u201cMedley of pieces we like\u201d, was\nexcellent and showed off the tremendous skill of the small group of performers with a stunning performance\nthat nicely rounded off the first half of\nentertainment.\nThere were two dance groups in the\nshowcase \u2013 Bellydancing and French\nModern Dance. Bellydancing completely disproved any notion I ever had\nabout Imperial being a place devoid of\nbeautiful and sexy women. Their two\nroutines showed off that these girls\nwere talented as well as fit, flexible\nand fun. Worth the ticket price alone.\nFrench Modern Dance are three of my\nleast favourite words. However, I really\nenjoyed their routine! It was intelligent,\ncreative and well executed. Yet another\nexample of talented performers getting\nout there and entertaining the audience whilst enjoying themselves at the\nsame time.\nFilipino Martial Arts and Wushu\npresented two outstanding, but very\ndifferent, martial arts demonstrations.\nFilipino Martial Arts, accompanied\nby a thumping drum and bass track,\nstaged a number of sparring sessions\nwith a wide range of weapons which\nsegued into a demonstration of beating\noff muggers with whatever you have\nto hand \u2013 umbrellas, belts, scarves,\nnewspapers, cups of coffee. A high energy and highly skilled performance.\nWushu\u2019s demonstration was a more\ntraditional demonstration of skill, bal-ance, elegance and finesse performed\nwith jaw-dropping precision. The pas-sion, skill and drama from both demonstrations firmly confirmed their\nplace in an event dedicated to the celebration and performance of art.\nOne of the highlights of the show-case, for me, were the Techtonics. A\ntwelve-strong, male, close vocal harmony group, these guys sum up what\narts at Imperial are all about \u2013 taking\nan idea and making it a reality, executing it with flair and fun. Less than two\nyears ago, students Christian Carter\nand Ed Brightman decided that they\nwanted to set up an a cappella group,\nfound ten willing recruits and made it\nhappen. Their performance was hugely\nentertaining, as the guys confidently\nworked the audience, enjoying every\nminute of it and producing a fantastic\nsound. I will definitely be making the\neffort to see this group again.\nThe show was rounded off in style by\na performance from the Musical Theatre Society who gave a sneak preview\nof their upcoming production of Hair,\nwhich, by the time this goes to print,\nwill have been on this week, Tues 9th \u2013\nSat 13th March. If this preview was anything to go by, the Union Concert Hall\nis in for one of the best performances\nof a musical from one of the strongest casts I\u2019ve seen in years. The hippy\nrock musical, Hair, sees the company\ntackling the iconic show complete with\n60\u2019s-perfect costumes, fantastic vocals,\ntop choreography and, of course, long,\nflowing hair. Don\u2019t miss it.\nThe whole showcase was held together by the excellent comp\u00e8ring of\nBilly Feenan. Completely at home on\nthe stage and well clued up on the different acts performing, Feenan was the\nperfect ambassador for the talent on\ndisplay in this concert. As he observed,\nthe importance of Artsfest cannot\nbe understated for Imperial students\n\u2013 after all, at a dinner party or when\nnetworking with future contacts, a discussion on the Large Hadron Collider\nis never going to be as interesting as a\ndiscussion about art, dance, music, or\nmartial arts.\nThe arts are crucial for the students\nof Imperial. As important as it is to further your studies and research, the arts\nclubs and societies are a place that welcome students with one major thing in\ncommon \u2013 the desire to participate,\nhave a go and enjoy yourself. Imperial\nharbours a huge amount of talent; a\nfact that couldn\u2019t be made more clear\nby the performances at the Artsfest\nshowcase. With groups that not only\nperform to a high standard but have a\ngreat time doing it, it\u2019s no surprise to\nsee the same faces coming back to the\nsocieties year after year. And it\u2019s why I,\nalthough no longer a student, will continue to come back and enjoy the talent on offer. Don\u2019t make the mistake of\nmissing it whilst you\u2019re still a student.\nSwap your keyboard for one with black\nand white keys, your labcoat for a black\nbelt, your Schr\u00f6dinger for some Sondheim. You\u2019ll thank yourself in the years\nto come.\nWould you like to swap \u03c0 for Puccini?\nSeb Junemann reviews an Imperial arts explosion featuring sexy, gyrating Belly dancers and the Mario tune\nI got all the girls I got all the girls......

They were talking my language.\nAfter deliberation with my gang (not\nthe gun wielding hoodlum type gang,\nwe\u2019re too pussy for that) we decided\nthat \u2018buca time was now. And now.\nAnd now... I\u2019m sure you see where\nthat went. Anyhoo, I was auctioned\noff for the lofty price of \u00a330 to spend\nan hour with a female I\u2019d decided to\navoid. Dealbreaker.

Man up?\nSurly the fact that I\u2019m not lying in my\nbed watching so much daytime TV\nthat I\u2019m bored to the point of shitting\nmyself just to liven things up proves\nmanning up is well underway.\nWhilst sometimes us men can, possibly exaggerate our trials and tribulations in order to get a bit of cheap sym-pathy, in reality we just want a cuddle,\nunless you are a hyper-man-man in\nwhich case the steroids are probably\naddling your mind.

After an initial slow start to the\nseason we got into our stride and went on\nto enjoy a 10 match winning streak (which\ncoincidently started by beating the medics\n9-2). It has also been a high-scoring season\nfor us with 58 goals to date. We did well in\nBUCS finishing joint third, but our biggest\nachievement of the season is finishing top of\nour ULU league.\nBeing in the same BUCS and ULU leagues as\nthe medics, we have faced each other three\ntimes already this season and have won once\nand drawn twice. This makes for an exciting\nVarsity match and we will be looking for\nanother win against the medics to end our\nseason in style.\nCarina Carter IC Women\u2019s 2nd XI Captain\nOther Squad Members:\nMadison Coke\nSheena Cowell\nAnn-Marie Keane\nKathryn Leonard\nAlice Rowlands\nRabia Zia\nMistry\nGoode\nLaird (c)\nAllan\nKent\nDavies\nBlack\nMarshall\nQuinn\nRead\nPumphrey\nWe\u2019ve had a massive influx of new players into\nthe first team this season, which has really\nhelped to mix things up. It\u2019s taken a while for\neveryone to find their niche but with hard\nwork and dedication we are capable of playing\nsome first class hockey. Our new coach this\nyear has helped us to focus on core skills\nand through his feedback and guidance we\nhave been able to up our game, which should\nleave us in a strong position in our BUCS\nleague. Varsity is such a highly anticipated\ngame and year on year we have a tough\nmatch against Imperial. We relish the\nchallenge of playing a team that is a league\nabove us in BUCS and although we may\nenter this game as the underdogs, we\nwill not stop fighting for the title until\nthe final whistle blows.\nFiona Laird ICSM Women\u2019s 1st XI Captain\nOther Squad Members:\nLauren Chalmers\nCharlotte Richardson\nThe Medics Ladies 2nd hockey team have had\na good season. We\u2019re the first to admit that\nwe\u2019re not yet (and never really will be!) hockey\npros, so having fun is a big priority. Competing\nin the BUCS South Eastern League 5A and\nULU division 3, there have been some fantastic\nwins and some losses. Whatever the outcome\nthough, team spirit has been high and we\u2019ve\nhad plenty of laughs! We\u2019ve also welcomed\nquite a few new players to our squad who have\nbeen valuable assets to both the team and the\nclub. I\u2019d like to say a big thanks to everyone in\nthe squad, including this year\u2019s Varsity team.\nFollowing a very recent 2-2 draw against IC,\nwe\u2019re as eager as ever and ready to fight for this\nyear\u2019s Varsity.\nRachel Panniker ICSM 2nd XI Captain\nOther Squad Members:\nCharlotte Oliver\nElke Wynberg\nVarkey\nEwington\nSaide\nWrigley\nPanniker (c)\nBeer\nvan der Spuy\nMale\nRichmond\nLees\nToczek\nGliddon\nMiddlebroke\nBeresford\nTombs\nMehta\nKalmoni\nGalligani (c)\nClayton\nLewis\nFateh-Iravani\nPurcell\nThe IC Ladies 1s have been working hard,\naccomplishing a very successful season. In the\nULU league, the team has won all matches\nplayed so far and stands with a record of 16\ngoals in 3 matches. More importantly, after\ncomfortable beating the strongest teams\nin BUCS, the team has made the league so\nexciting that promotion will be decided on the\nlast fixture of the season. Ladies 1s have good\nchances of getting promoted to the South\nEastern Conference 1A, as we are facing\nChichester 2s (team we\u2019ve already\ntrashed with a boring 12-0 victory).\nThe IC Ladies 1s will be facing the\nmedics at Varsity after having played\nthem in the ULU cup final this Sunday.\nPlaying a league above them in both\nULU and BUCS, we will be looking to\nenforce our game from the beginning\non both the final and Varsity. So\nwatch out during Varsity, cause\nSunday\u2019s results will still be in\neveryone\u2019s minds...\nVictoria Galligani IC Women\u2019s 1st XI\nCaptain\nOther Squad Members:\nJessica Poore\nChelsea Wong\n\n"

The most reliable team - turning up to\nevery training, match and social, Netball 3s set\nan example to the rest of the club. The team\nhave gotten to know each other well, both on\nand off court, enabling match performance\nto improve week after week.

Last year our 4s were the only team to\nbeat the medics so this year we\u2019re aiming to\nreally wipe the floor with them, so watch out\nmedics, we\u2019re coming to get you!\nAmelia Al-Qazzaz IC 4th Team Captain\nSquad Members:\nAmelia Al-Qazzaz\nEmma Oakton\nJane Langdon-Davies\nZahra Moledina\nSihan Wang\nAisha Patel\nLayo Delano\nZoe Scheuringer\nCollege Medics\nLast season we were relegated from our\nBUCS league and finished in the bottom\nhalf of our ULU league. The first half on the\nseason was unlucky. Although we very much\nhad the talent within the team, a lack of\ntraining and experience of playing together\nmeant we lost a lot of matches. The second\nhalf of the season has been more successful.\nWe have improved as a team and are now\ncomfortably beating teams that we had\nlost to at the start of the season. We are\ncurrently 3rd from top in our BUCS league\nand about half way up in our ULU league. As\nfar as Varsity goes we have played and lost\nto the Medics twice this season. They have\nan advantage over us in terms of height and\nthey have been playing together as a team\nfor far longer. However, if we play our best\nnetball, we are capable of making the match\nextremely close. At Varsity anything can\nhappen, and we won\u2019t go down without a\nfight.\nCarolyn Sharpe IC 1st Team Captain\nSquad Members:\nCarolyn Sharpe\nTamar Loach\nNicole Evans\nEmma Gould\nNina Davies\nHelen Gill\nMarie-Louisa Awolaja\nJenny Munroe\nHaving such hard working and committed\nplayers makes my job as captain far easier,\nwhich is why we as a team have had such\ngreat success in netball this year.\nConsidering the very high standard of\nnetball this year, we\u2019ve done really well in\nboth leagues. Currently ranked 2nd place\nin ULU after only having lost 1 game, and\ncoming 3rd in the BUCS league. We\u2019ve also\nmanaged to get through to the ULU cup\nfinal after several challenging games which\nwill be played on March 20th against Kings\nCollege.\nThe highlight of the netball year as always\nwill be Varsity which I\u2019m very excited for.\nHaving been triumphant twice this year\nagainst IC, I am confident we can continue\nour success and come away victorious.\nFfion Harry ICSM 1st Team Captain\nSquad Members\nFfion Harry (c)\nBeth Nelly\nCatherine Atkin\nLindsay Hennah\nHannah Ribbans\nKandi Ejiofor\nLouise Thornhill\nI am incredibly proud of what the team\nhas achieved this year. We expected a\ntough time in BUCS following promotion\nlast year, but victory against St. George\u2019s\nensured we will stay up and are on track\nfor a 3rd or 4th place finish. In the ULU\ncup we reached the quarter-finals, losing\nnarrowly to a team in the Premiership. We\naimed for promotion in our ULU league,\nalthough we haven\u2019t achieved this, we\nshould finish high in the table. Our record\nagainst IC remains impeccable. We knocked\nthe 3s out of the cup with a decisive 20 goal\nthrashing, and aim to better this at Varsity.\nOne of my favourite moments of the season\nwas beating IC 2s in the ULU league. It\u2019s\nvery amusing when a team demands at the\nend \u2018how could you POSSIBLY beat us?\u2019 \u2013\nalthough we didn\u2019t understand the surprise\nas we are a BUCS league above them and\nhaven\u2019t lost the fixture since 2007!\nAlexandra Perkins ICSM 3rd Team Captain\nSquad Members:\nJedda Oyenuga\nGeorge Hart\nRoisin Dunwoody\nSarneet Singh\nMegan Mackenzie\nColleen McGregor\nSarah Hancox\nAffie Etok\nEmma Horton\nHaving been promoted into a higher division\nin ULU at the end of last season we were all\napprehensive about whether we could adapt\nto a much tougher standard of netball this\nyear. Luckily, we have not been disappointed\nand will be finishing this season well within\nthe top half of our new division . The season\nstarted with victories over LSE, Queen\nMary\u2019s 3s and 4s, Royal Holloway and RUMS.\nTo increase our number of fixtures, we have\nplayed a number of friendly matches against\nother teams. This included a nail biting 28-27\nvictory over GKT as well as wins against\nRUMS and St Georges.\nOur hope for Varsity this year, besides\nwinning, is to play the best we have ever\nplayed and enjoy what will definitetly be a\nhighly competetive match.\nFlo Chamberlain ICSM 4th Team Captain\nICSM 4th VII Netball Squad\nFlo Chamberlain\nSophia Butt\nCharlotte Lake\nKat Lau\nMahua Bhaduri\nNina Vasir\nBecca Le Vay\nClare Hutchinson\nNiki Shah\nNat Ilenkovan\nCharlie Stephens\nCollege Medics\nICU Netball 2nds has had an outstanding\nseason, a compliment to both the new\nplayers who have joined the team and the last\nyear\u2019s remaining team members. Team spirit\ntogether with great banter and truly talented\nmembers has been the key to success with\na promotion in BUCS and what should have\nbeen a promotion in ULU. Only underhand\ntactics from some dirty medics hailing from\nanother university, they all blend into one\nafter a while, denied us what should have\nbeen rightfully ours.\nBitter? Yes, just a bit. An earlier game in the\nseason against the medics saw us fall by\nthe way side in the 3rd quarter due to bit of\nmismanagement. Nonetheless, we are back\non top form, pumped from the gym and a\nfew heavy nights at the union, ready to take\non the students from the polytechnic down\nthe road.\nClaire McNulty IC 2nd TeamCaptain\nIC 2nd VII Netball Squad:\nLucy Byrne\nClaire McNulty\nBernice Cutler (c)\nRachel Zaborski\nSadie McNaughton\nLorna Turner\nJacqueline Fok\nAnna Haslop\nHaving been promoted in both our ULU\nand BUCS leagues after our 2008/2009\nseason; ICSM 2s netball had high hopes\nfor making a dent in our new leagues.\nNearing the end of the season; we are\ncurrently winning both of our new leagues,\nhoping for another double promotion and\nexceeding all my expectations as captain.\nWe are also in the ULU Reserve Cup final\nfor the first time; hoping for a win against\nGKT 2s.\nOf my 3 years on the team; this has been\nour most successful and ambitious season.\nWith my team playing the best I have ever\nseen and with a win over IC 2s already\nthis year, I am expecting another Varsity\nvictory.

An undefeated season so far\nwith only a draw to blemish the record, the\nteam won the ULU Challenge Cup for the 4th\nyear in a row at the weekend. With only two\nleague matches remaining we\u2019re aiming to\nfinish on top of the ULU league for the second\nyear running. Varsity creates a slight paradox\nof \u2018playing ourselves\u2019, which typically means\na more relaxed/beer filled match than other\nsports may face. Medics\nwill be hoping that a much\nsmaller IC team doesn\u2019t\nonce again walk all over\nthem.\nIC Lacrosse Squad:\nIan Hunt\nLilly Couper\nDave Thompson\nTom Smith\nPhilipa Owens\nClaire Scott\nDamien Powell\nSam Sturge\nRoz Gisbey\nLizzie Allen\nOver the last season we have acquired a\nlot of new player\u2019s, which has been vital in\nenabling us to carry on producing a full team.\nMany of these player\u2019s have never picked up\na rugby ball before in their life and this meant\nthat we have been unable to produce many\nwins this season. However, with the end of\nthe season drawing in there are a few more\nseven\u2019s matches coming up. This gives us the\nopportunity to make up for the losses, as\nwe have the advantage in this field with the\nmajority of our team being on the small side\nbut faster as a result.\nVarsity for us as a team will be different\nto many other sports as we normally play\nalongside one another, medics and non-medics, making it difficult to play aggressively\nagainst players whom we consider to be both\nfriends and team mates. However, I hope that\nthis first experience of sevens for the season\nwill set most of the newbie\u2019s up with the\nexperience for future matches.\nJasmin Hodgson IC Women\u2019s Rugby Captain\nImperial Squad:\nEmma Banks\nSigne Liepina\nKP Sudhoff\nAlexis Shih\nLouisa Stokes\nAnnabel Dale\nMargherita\nCollege Medics\nThis season has been very successful for IC\nsquash. Having been promoted into the top\ntier of BUCS competition last year, we\u2019ve\nbeaten the likes of Bristol, Loughborough,\nLeeds Met. and Birmingham 1st teams.\nWe ended up finishing 3rd in the league\nand therefore seeded 3rd for the cup. We\neased through the first round of the cup\nwith a 5-0 victory over UCL. Next up was\nLoughborough in the quarters who were\nhungry for revenge after our narrow victory\nin the league. We managed to win the best-of-5 match with Peter Marshall winning the\ndecider. This resulted in qualification the\nsemi finals, with both the semi final and final\nto be played on the weekend of the 13/14th\nMarch.\nI predict IC will be too strong for ICSM if they\nput out a full team. This said, I think ICSM will\nbe competitive in the 1st team match with\ntwo players from the regular IC 1st team.\nHarry Beeston IC 1st Team Captain\nIC Squash Team:\nJames Simpson\nAhmed El-Refee\nLionel Ong\nChris Sgobba\nJoe Prinold\nThe season started off with high hopes (a\nbit too high on my part) and a lot of positive\nattitude! My aim was to get promoted.\nWishful thinking. We finished 4th in the\ntable.\nApart from several bruises and aching\nlegs, the season left with us some great\nmemories: amazing coaching sessions\nfrom our coach Harry Beeston; lessons in\nsportsmanship and most of all team spirit at\nits highest.\nThis 2010, we aim to put up a great fight\nagainst the strong IC team. Luckily for us,\nwe have pinched a few of their players.\nThese are the medics at heart and have\ndecided to back the ICSM team (to\nvictory?). With home turf advantage\nhowever, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game. But we hope\nit\u2019s ours!\nAbhishek Kakkar ICSM 1st Team Captain\nICSM Squash Team:\nHarry Beeston\nIsmail Sharif\nMihir Desai\nOmar Shaikh\nAbhishek Kakkar\nICSM Lacrosse Squad:\nLizzy Keeling\nAki Fukutomi\nChris Baldwin\nElsa Butrous\nIzzie Brown\nLeah Adler\nCamellia Wong\nJeremy Webb\nJames Matthams\nJoe Bacarese-Hamilton\nDan Taylor\nBex Singh\nAbi Murugesh-Warren\nGaby Prager\nHannah Brooks\nAnnie Mondon-Ballantyne\nSophie Moin\nEmily Murray\nDominique Finnegan-Parsons\nMedicals Squad:\nJasmin Hodgson\nBryonnie Biddell\nHelena Lee\nKatherine Fox\nAmani Chowdhury\nJessica Alcena\nMurooj Abdi\nMichelle Gatter\nSeetha Muthalagappan\nCollege\nThis year has been a pretty successful one\nfor the IC Men\u2019s 2nd team. In the ULU cup\ncompetition we made it to the semi-final,\nlosing out in a close match with the Royal\nHolloway 1st team. In the ULU league we are\ncurrently sitting in 2nd place, with only our\n1st team ahead. With only one game to go\nhopefully we can make it an IC one/two. In\nBUCS we were promoted last year up to the\nSouth East division 1 putting us in a tough\nleague up against a number of 1st teams from\nother universities. However, we have finished\nin 3rd place which is an excellent result for us.\nIn Varsity this year we\u2019ll be hoping to beat\nthe medics in style\u2026 without loosing a single\ngame!?\nJoe Prinold IC 2nd Team Captain\nIC Squash Team:\nJoe Prinold\nMike Gamblin\nHisham Shehata\nDillan Ganesh\nStephen Wall\nUnlike the long standing 1st team, The ICSM\nsquash 2nd team is a newly created and\nwell oiled machine dedicated to a single\ngoal - Varsity. The team has been gathered\nfrom accross ICSMSC and lead by Will\nBermingham.

Thanks\nto the hard work of our excellent Chair,\nTreasurer and Tour Manager (Will\nCowley, Leo Martins and Tom Budden respectively), as well as the festival\nadministrators, the tour went ahead\nwithout a hitch.\nOur eleven and a half hour plane\njourney (with a four hour stopover\nin Paris) began on the afternoon of\nThursday 28th of February. Thanks to\nthe complementary drinks from Air\nFrance on both flights and their exemplary service we all made it to Johannesburg in good spirits, bar possibly\nthe three people whose luggage was\nleft in Paris and just made it to South\nAfrica in time for our first concert the\nfollowing day\u2026\nThroughout our time in Johannesburg we were looked after superbly by\nour host families \u2013 most of whom were\nmembers of a local choir run by Richard Cock, the festival administrator\u2013\nwho obligingly ferried us to and from\nour rehearsal venue and fed and watered us until we could take no more.\nThe day we arrived in the country, after briefly meeting our hosts, we went\nstraight into a rehearsal at our concert\nvenue, the Linder Auditorium at the\nWitwatersrand University in Johannesburg. The next day \u2013 that of our first\nconcert \u2013 most of us were up bright\nand early with our hosts visiting the\nlocal African craft markets to do some\nhaggling or at some of the prestigious\nmuseums in the city, such as the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill.\nThe afternoon rehearsal was followed\nby a fantastic pre-concert dinner put\non by the organisers of the festival for\nwhich we were all incredibly grateful.\nThe first concert, with a programme of\nElgar\u2019s \u201cCockaigne\u201d Overture, Finzi\u2019s\nEcologue for piano and strings Op.10\nwith soloist Malcolm Nay, Elgar\u2019s\nPomp and Circumstance March No.1\nand Rachmaninov\u2019s Symphony No. 2\nin E minor Op.27, went down exceptionally well with the audience \u2013 who\neven gave us a standing ovation after\njust the first half. Encores of Pomp and\nCircumstance, with audience partici-pation, ensued!\nMany of the members of the orchestra spent the night partying out with\ntheir hosts, most notably Sam Leveridge and others who were out celebrating his 21st birthday to the extent\nthat he was unable to make the early\nstart the next day for our safari trip to\nthe Pilanesburg Games Reserve. Despite what was considered a late start\nfor a safari by our guides (about ten\no\u2019clock in the morning by the time we\ngot there) we were fortunate enough\nto see three of the Big Five game \u2013 el-ephants, lions and rhinos \u2013 and many\nother animals, not least of which were\nthe giraffes, hippos and zebra. It was\nan amazing experience to see these\nanimals in the wild. Once again in the\npark\u2019s shop we were all bargaining over\nthe gifts we wanted to take home, before heading back to the park\u2019s resort\nfor an amazing buffet lunch and a relaxing afternoon in the sunshine by the\npool!\nMonday brought with it another free\nmorning with our generous (and very\ntrusting!) hosts, one of which allowed\nsome of the more senior medics in the\norchestra to borrow their car so they\ncould explore the city some more by\nthemselves. A car in Johannesburg is\nunfortunately an essential, as they do\nnot have a public transport infrastructure as in London, and in some areas it\nwould not have been sensible to walk\naround as tourists. The afternoon rehearsal brought us our first meeting\nwith the soloists for the evening, Lidia\nBaich (violin) and Matthias Fletzberger (piano), who were both without doubt fantastic performers. It was\nalso a chance for the orchestra to get\nused to playing alongside a rock band,\nas the concert was entitled \u201cRock me,\nAmadeus\u201d. Another excellent meal was\nprovided for the orchestra and we all\ngot to watch the most amazing sunset\nover Johannesburg before going in to\nplay. The programme consisted of Mozart\u2019s Symphony No. 5 and Symphony\nNo. 37, followed by Mozart\u2019s Violin\nConcerto No. 4 with Lidia Baich. The\nrock band then joined us to perform\nthe andante from Mozart\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 21 and then Saint-Saens\u2019 Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso for\norchestra and rock band, arranged by\nLidia Baich to round off the evening.\nOnce again the audience loved the\nconcert and, unbeknownst to the or-chestra, it was in fact broadcast live on\nSouth Africa\u2019s Classic FM.\nThe members of the orchestra then\nspent their last night with their host\nfamilies, giving gifts and cards and\nmuch gratitude. The following morning we set out for our final concert in\nSouth Africa in the township of Alexandra, just outside the city, in the local\ncommunity centre. The audience consisted mostly of local school children\nwho came up on stage to sit amongst\nthe orchestra and got a chance to play\nsome of the percussion instruments\nand to conduct. We played excerpts\nfrom most of our pieces, with Richard\nDickins introducing the different instruments and getting them the play a\nlittle something to the audience. Highlights included a version of \u2018In the Jungle\u2019 for bassoon quartet and a mariachi\nband tune from the brass section. The\nICSO perform in Johannesburg at the Linder Auditorium, Witwatersrand University.\nentire orchestra loved playing for the\nchildren and having them come and sit\nwith them \u2013 one of the young girls was\nso good at conducting that we almost\ndidn\u2019t need Richard for the rest of the\nconcert!\nBefore heading back to the airport\nwe had the most fantastic end to tour\nin the form of a buffet lunch (once\nmore paid for by the tour organisers)\nand pool side antics at the Johannesburg country club. Prizes were given\nout to the Tour Couple (you know who\nyou are!) and Tour King and Queen\namongst other things. The orchestra\ngot an opportunity to say thank you\nto the organisers for our time in South\nAfrica \u2013Richard Cock, Florien Uhlig,\nCaroline Kennard and Samantha McGrath \u2013 and we even got an invitation\nback to play in both the Cape Town\nand Johannesburg Festivals next year.\nThere was not a single person who\ndid not enjoy their time away; the trip\nmay have been short but it was worth\nevery moment and everyone is more\nthan eager to go back. It is hard to\ndescribe just how amazing the experience was and how much fun everyone\nhad just being away together on tour in\na place so far from home. All we can\ndo is to say another huge thank you to\nall the people that made the trip possible and looked after us so well while\nwe were away.\nIf you would like to hear more of\nICSO our next concert is on Friday\n12th March at 8pm in the Great Hall,\nwith a programme of Juan Pablo Moncayo\u2019s Huapango (for which we will\nbe joined by IC Dance Company),\nBeethoven\u2019s 2nd Piano Concerto with\nsoloist Shuang Wang (Medicine, year\n6) and Holst\u2019s The Planets. Tickets are\n\u00a33 in advance (\u00a34 on the door) for students and are available from any member of the orchestra, or from the Blyth\nCentre. We look forward to seeing you\nall there!\nA safari opportunity turns into an occasion for the cat to meet some bigger cats.\n\n"

    "content": "Allegations of candidate misconduct raised\nRumours have been circulating this\nweek about one of the candidates in\nthe Union elections, Andrew Bromfield, after an anonymous email was\nsent to editors of Imperial student\nmedia, supposedly from a member\nof the Union\u2019s casual staff. The self-styled \u2018mole\u2019 claimed to represent the\nmajority of Union casual staff when\nthey said they felt it \u201cwould be an\noutrage if Andrew Bromfield were to\nwin the election\u201d. Bromfield is one of\ntwo candidates running for the role of\nDeputy President \u2013 Finance & Services which entails responsibility for\nday to day financial administration,\nbudgetary queries, collating student\nfeedback and coordinating the Summer Ball.\nAlthough the message was entirely\nanonymous and the claims that Bromfield was \u201ccontinually... abusive and\naggressive\u201d were entirely unsubstan-tiated, a report was also leaked of an\nincident in which Andrew Bromfield\nwas ejected from the Union premises last term, for being verbally and\nphysically abusive. The incident occurred in November last year just\nafter midnight, when Bromfield was\nseen to strike another man in Da\nVinci\u2019s. When asked to leave, Bromfield refused several times and was\neventually physically removed. While\ndoor staff attempted to take back his\npewter tankard in order to retrieve his\nRox Middleton\nRox Middleton\nCasual staff at the Union are integral to running events nearly every night\nID card, he ran back inside and was\nonce more carried out while he tried\nto punch and kick the staff.\nTwo Senior Union stewards provided statements on the case but these\nwere later simultaneously withdrawn,\nalthough they did confirm that Bromfield had been involved in an \u2018incident\u2019. Bromfield has responded to the\nemail and the leaking of the report\nand claims that parts of the report are\nfictitious and written vaguely so as to\nimply the worst about his behaviour.\nHe concedes that the bar staff \u201cwere\nangry with [his] lack of cooperation\nthat evening\u201d but denies that the incident was as portrayed. He points\nout that although he struggled against\nbeing carried \u2018unceremoniously\u2019 out\nof the Quad, at no point did he try to\ncause physical harm to staff, and the\nverbal abuse cited was limited to calling one steward \u2018idiot\u2019, for which he\nhas since apologised. Bromfield also\npointed out that one member of staff\nthat night was opposing candidate\nRavi Pall, although he did not accuse\nhis fellow candidate of underhand\ntactics. (For the record, this report\nhas not been influenced by Pall\u2019s involvement with felix.)\nFurther rumours have been spreading about two other candidates running separately who, it is alleged, stole\nwine from a Cheese & Wine evening\norganised by Imperial College Cheese\nSociety on March 5th last year. Live!\n(live.cgcu.net) reported this week\nthat each of the two walked into the\n4 felix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nBarely anyone turns up to new format Hustings\nHustings were largely unsuccessful\nthis week as the Union tried to ramp\nup election-fever. Voting opened this\npast Tuesday and this coincided with\nthe poorly attended second round of\nHustings held at the Southside Social\nSpace.\nThe first round of Hustings took\nplace at 6.30pm Thursday 5th of\nMarch in da Vinci\u2019s bar; this venue\nhas traditionally been host to the second round of the election\u2019s Hustings in\nprevious years. Hustings are public forums where all the candidates running\nin the election have the opportunity to\npresent themselves and their campaign\nto the adoring public.\nThe newly-formatted second round\nof Hustings took place this past Tuesday (9th March) to an audience largely\nmade-up of campaign teams and not\nthe Freshers which the Union had tar-geted. It is particularly embarrassing\nfor the Union as they had told candidates to remove Hustings details, such\nas time and date, from their campaign\nmaterial because they feared attendance at Southside Social Space would\ngo beyond a recommended 120 capac-ity. This was aptly pointed out, albeit\nwith a hint of sarcasm, by Presidential\nhopeful Alex Kendall after the ques-tion: \u2018What would you do to improve\nHustings?\u2019\nSabbatical\n2010\nfelix coverage\nOpposing candidate Chris Darby\nrefused to point the blame at the students for the poor turn-out.\n\u201cPeople have been asking me all week\nwhen they can come to hustings so I\ndon\u2019t think they really are apathetic. I\ndon\u2019t think there is that much apathy,\npeople did genuinely want to be here,\u201d\nhe reckoned in response to a question that enquired into the candidate\u2019s\nthoughts on general student apathy at\nImperial.\nThe event was restricted to residents\nof Southside, Eastside, Garden and\nWeeks halls but failed to attract numbers into double figures.\nThe Returning Officers\u2019 red faces\nstarted to complement the lucidly\nbright pink T-shirts the current sabbatical team were wearing on the evening.\nEven though the proceedings were delayed and the Southside Social Space\nseemed relatively occupied first year\naudience numbers peaked at around\nfive midway through the evening.\nAnother Presidential candidate,\nSerge Vasylechko, saw the lack of advertising and the esoteric nature of the\nUnion as the main problems, and suggested further reformatting of the election process as the solution.\n\u201cAll this year\u2019s candidates know each\nother so not enough people are getting\ninvolved. We need better advertisement,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d hold a proper debate in the Great Hall [for Hustings].\u201d\nHustings in da Vinci\u2019s last week was\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief the usual rowdy affair with heckling\nthroughout. However, Presidential\ncandidate Stan Tarasov described the\nexperience as \u201cunderwhelming\u201d and\nexpected \u201cbanners and chanting\u201d.\nRON, Re-open Nominations can-didate, stood strong throughout the\nproceedings and poked plenty of holes\nin candidates speeches and answers to\nthe audience\u2019s questions.\nIt has been a tough week for those\ninvolved in the Imperial College Union Elections with allegations of misconduct by several candidates flying\naround College.\nfelix also decided to retract statements from last week\u2019s issue after the\nsuggestion by Returning Officer John\nJames, though it is now the Union\u2019s\nturn to face the flak after something\nwent very wrong with their \u2018fresh\u2019 approach to election hustings this year.\nVoting is still open, but closes at\n23:59 Saturday the 13th of March.\nReturning\nOfficer Daniel\nHill oversaw a\nwell organised\nevent on the\nnight, but\nattendance\nat Southside\nwas extremely\noverestimated\nFairtrade Fortnight event on separate\noccasions during the evening without\npaying and were seen to take bottles\nof wine. These bottles were apparently later found in a Physics lecture the-atre. It is claimed that both candidates\nreturned again later in the evening\nand were verbally abusive, one was\nalso allegedly physically violent. After security was called, the pair were\nremoved from the Huxley building.\nIf true, these allegations bring into\nquestion the suitability of the candidates for sabbatical positions.\nCheesesoc was unable to comment\non any rumours about the event according to Union election rules, and\ncomments on the Live! website all\nsuggest that the story\u2019s bias is the result of mudslinging by friends of opposing candidates.\nVoting is still taking place online\nfor sabbatical positions until 11.59pm\nSaturday, via the Union website (www.\nimperialcollegeunion/elections).\nDPFS candidate\nAndrew\nBromfield is said\nto have verbally\nabused several\nmembers of\nstaff, then was\nsubsquently\n\u2018physically\nremoved\u2019 from\nthe premises\nAnyone that isn\u2019t a candidate or campaigner here? No? Oh\n\n"

With intentions to develop\nfurther and enter into BUCS next season\nwe have much to look forward to. Varsity is\nalways an occasion that we look forward to,\nwith ICSM getting closer to that elusive \u2018W\u2019.\nHopefully this is the year. Nevertheless we\nwill go out, play hard and enjoy the game.\nShammi Kakad ICSM 1st Team Captain\nOther Squad Members:\nShammi Kakad\nKen Agu\nMalek Al-Chalabi\nArun Anadakumar\nJacky Chen\nMavin Kashyap\nRajiv Krishnakumar\nHonyee Lai\nDavid Li\nYasser Magmoud\nPierre Morris\nJohn Murray-Bruce\nChristos Mylonas\nAmir Nanneh\nTobi Obisanya\nIoannis Orfandis\nBo Osibody\nRasheed Rabiu\nSunit Raja\nNadeev Wijesuriya\nThis year has been very successful so far,\nand I am very pleased with both the new\nplayers who have joined the team, and the\nimproved sense of team and club spirit. We\nare near the top of both our BUCS and ULU\nleagues, as well as finishing runners up in the\nULU Challenge Cup. As one of the youngest\nteams in either league, these results are very\npromising, and we are returning nearly all\nof our players next year, when we aim to\nbecome the first Imperial basketball team\nto win both our BUCS and ULU leagues.\nIn terms of Varsity, I would like to encourage\nas many Imperial students to come and\nwatch what are undoubtedly the best\nathletes currently enrolled at Imperial. The\nMedics do not have a very strong team, and\nso we hope to use the game as a showcase\nfor our athleticism, solid team-play and\nenthusiasm for the game.\nNicholas Lutsko IC 1st Team Captain\nCollege Medics\nBasketball Women\u2019s 1st\nLast year we entered Varsity unsure about\nhow the game would fare following the\nprevious year\u2019s embarrassment of a threefold defeat. However a smaller deficit last\nyear gives us hope for this year\u2019s game. The\nhistorically uneven game turned out to be\na well contested and more importantly\nboosted the team\u2019s confidence. The team\nhas welcomed many new recruits who have\nbecome critical players thanks to coach\nHannah Barrett. The team has worked hard\nall year with determination and a constant\nlevel of enthusiasm which has reflected well\nthis season. Although league performances\nwere tough due to the amalgamation of the\ntwo divisions, semi-finalists in the ULU cup\nis an achievement all players are extremely\nproud of. We are rapidly becoming\ncontenders and hope that Varsity this year\nwill allow us to showcase our new talent and\nhopefully take the win!\nAnita Ponnuthurai ICSM 1st Team Captain\nAfter a realtively poor 08/09 season,\nICUAFC 1st XI have built a new squad which\nhas achieved a lot this season. It took a\nwhile for the squad to settle and find its feet\nbut it is now widely suggested amongst its\nopposition that at this stage of the season\nthe 1st XI have developed to be amongst the\nbest university football teams in London.\nAfter ruining the unbeaten records of\nSOAS and UCL, two of ULU\u2019s top three\nteams, Imperial have in hindsight rued their\nlackluster performances against the weaker\nteams in the league. With consistency\nthe major area to work on for next year,\nImperial will be looking to improve on their\nsatisfactory 3rd place in BUCS 3A.\nThe major success this year has been in the\nULU Challenge Cup. A mouthwatering tie\nagainst League leaders LSE on 21 March will\nbe the final game for Imperial to achieve\nsome silverware this season.\nThis year\u2019s Varsity is predicted to be a close\naffair after a marked improvement in the\nMedicals squad. Hopefully, Imperial will use\ntheir strength, speed & skill to overcome a\ndisciplined and physical Medicals squad.\nMustapher Botchway IC 1st XI Captain\nOther Squad Members:\nWilliam Swain\nNathan Ferrol\nThomas Fryatt\nRomain Chauvet\nPatrick McMullen\nThis season has seen the ICSMFC 1st team\nbattle to the very end. Throughout the\nentire season the 1st team have shown that\nhaving enough heart and desire can earn\nyou due respect on the football pitch. The\nseason started slowly when many of the\nteam\u2019s more experienced players were\naway on their elective periods. However, a\nyoung and boisterous team came away with\nsome commendable wins against tough\nopposition, improving with very game. The\nsecond half of the season was when the\nteam really got into its stride with a well\nearnt 6 game unbeaten run. Courageous\nperformances against teams in higher\nleagues showed we could compete at that\nlevel and spurred the team on further. With\na previous game against IC 1st team narrowly\nending in defeat on penalties Varsity is set to\nbe a close contest this year.\nKarim Amer ICSM 1st XI Captain\nOther Squad Members:\nUzoma Nnajiuba\nBotchway (c)\nSapin\nGraham\nPaxton\nHayes\nBenincasa\nZarnas\nVallin\nHill\nEshun\nTofis\nLenihan\nRatliff\nWilsonMorkeh\nO\u2019Sullivan\nAhmed Raganathan\nAmer\nTomlinson\nSergot\nUner\nHughes\nSquad Members:\nYosuke Hamada\nJairo.\nCuartas-Molina\nIffy Obadeyi\nNick Lutsko\nMina Samaan\nWill Vallas\nAleks Ponjavic\nCyrus Chan\nJohn Yeats\nJosh Allison\nBojan Tamburic\nFernando.\nPacheco-Monteiro\nJohnny Kingsley\nRIch Bargh\nSquad Members:\nAnita Ponnuthurai\nEmma Amoafo\nMira Pecheva\nDenise\nOsei-Kuffour\nRachel Carten\nJoanna Kefas\nKa Ki Chow\nChristina Lees\nHannah Barrett\nAlexis Nelson\nMariam Akinpeju\nOverall we\u2019ve had a successful season\nthis year.

The bitter rivalry between scientists and Medics\nis ignited as teams of hot-headed degenerates line up to take battle in a variety of sports. Yeah, it\u2019s easy to make\nsomething sound exciting, like \u2018the\nULTIMATE BIRO\u2019 or \u2018THE UNFORGIVING WHISK\u2019. I can tell you right\nnow that I have and will forever have\nmore fun with my ultimate biro than I\nwould watching a bunch of rowdy apes\nfumble about with a ball. This forced\nmedieval antagonism is laughable. It\u2019s\ncomparable to Romeo and Juliet - two\nsides hating each other, but not really\nsure why. At least Romeo and Juliet\nhas a plot-line and duels to the death.\nDuelling is the sport of men. DO NOT\nMISCONSTRUE THIS WITH FENCING! I mean proper swords, with\nproper blood and proper screams of\nagony, not two guys in silly white suits\npoking each other with bendy sticks.\nPouring a pint down someone\u2019s shirt\nand then punching them in the face\nis hardly comparable to a well placed\nrapier-thrust to the abdomen. There\nare lots of people at Imperial I would\nlove to see disembowelled. What,\nthat shocks you? Nothing annoys me\nmore than people telling me it\u2019s wrong\nto wish people dead. 1.8 people die a\nsecond worldwide, a couple more is\nbarely going to make a statistical difference and if it\u2019s the only permanent\nsolution to having to listen to egotistic\nstories about pounding that slutty fat\ngirl from DB\u2019s, I really couldn\u2019t give a\nshit.

In all fairness,\nyou are cunts and that\u2019s not going to\nchange, but we admire you for taking\nit light-heartedly. If truth be told, you\nare unanimously out-cunted by the\nfootball team. The reason Hangman\nhas strayed from mentioning them\npreviously is largely due to the fact\nthat the moniker \u2018The Rugby Team\u2019\nhas just become a collective term for\nanyone we find acting like a twat in the\nunion. As Hangman strives for fairness and equailty, it is only right that\nwe conduct an unbiased investigation\ninto who exactly thought it would be a\ngreat idea to strip down to their waist\nin dB\u2019s and proceed to slide, Klinsmann\nstyle, across a table covered in cider\nand vomit. Ohhh, it\u2019s the football team.\nWhat a hilarious stunt! It certianly impressed the surrounding crowd, well\nthe surrounding football team. Everyone else just thought you looked like\na twat. You know what would be fun-nier? how about you smash a few bottles across the table before you glide\nacross gleefully like a retarded child on\nthe back of a dolphin?

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nwo tramps, Vladimir and\nEstragon, wait in a blast-ed, seemingly postapoca-lyptic wasteland seemingly devoid of any other\nlife. It could be the aftermath of the\nBlitz (Godot was written in the Fifties)\nor a natural disaster. The raw material\nis there and as with the best plays, each\nproduction can breathe new life into\nit with its own cultural and political\ncontext. In this case, Haiti could easily\nspring to mind.\nWhat are they waiting for? They're\nwaiting for a chap called Godot.\nVladimir and Estragon may have a\nlong and storied history, such is the\ncomfort and familiarity of their rela-tionship. But they wait from morning\nto evening. Each evening at the height\nof their anticipation, a young boy appears for a brief period offering only\nthe most sparse information regarding Godot's whereabouts, and when\nGodot fails to show up, they return the\nnext day with the promise of the titular character's appearance. It happens\nagain the next evening with a similar sequence of events - it is said that\nWaiting for Godot is the only theatrical\nproduction in which nothing happens\n- twice.\nAnd what do the main protagonists\ndiscuss while they wait? Not much, ad-mittedly. Such is the ease of Beckett's\ndialogue it could easily pass as banter\nto the casual listener. So what is the\npoint of Waiting For Godot?\nAs many of you who studied English\nLit at school may recall, Godot was\na standard text at many schools. For\nsome reason my teacher, the affable\nMs Shepherd, went for Coleridge or\nCarol Ann Duffy or something of the\nsort. It felt interesting at the time, but\nnot the canonical and epic prospect\nsomething like Godot or The Wasteland might have presented. Having\nsaid that, most of my friends who studied these said the texts usually left their\nEnglish classes in full FML mode.\nSo let's sum it up so far - there are a\ntotal of five characters, there's no plot,\nthe setting is epically depressing and\nnothing happens - twice. So why would\nyou want to see it? But seeing it people\nare, and in droves. Beckett's formerly\n(and still) obscure play has been running at the Theatre Royal Haymarket\nfor coming onto a year now and has\nattracted the talents of Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and, er, Matthew\nKelly. It has been accepted into the\nestablishment.\nHistorically elusive and baffling,\nbreathtakingly minimalist yet achingly\nrich, Waiting for Godot has been considered almost universally one of the\ngreatest theatrical accomplishments of\nthe last century. Why?\nThe brilliance of Beckett's play is\nthat it is both non-specific and incredibly concrete, endlessly elusive and yet\nuniversal. With this quartet you feel\nthe play's realness: they're not trying\nto embody metaphysics, they're acting people \u2013 people like ourselves who\ncontinue to wait, even as we ponder\nwhat we're waiting for. People have\ninterpreted the setting as a kind of\nmetaphysical state of purgatory, with\nthe titular character the resident deity\nof sorts.\nSome have interpreted an underlying message that waiting - for God, for\nrelease, for absolution, for resolution,\nanything - is futile and that life is for\nliving, not waiting. These are all mostly speculative and Beckett himself has\nsaid that audiences and critics often\noveranalyse his, and the play's, relatively straightforward intentions.\nIan McKellen's Estragon and Roger\nRees' Vladimir are a joy to watch. Of\ncourse, the majority of audiences will\nrecognise McKellen from his film work\nbut this is not the first time he and director Sean Mathias have worked together on the stage, having previously\ncollaborated on Uncle Vanya, Dance\nof Death and Aladdin. A Bolton na-tive, he reverts to a distinctive Lancastrian drawl as he conveys a character\nso affable and charming, yet so irasci-ble, mercurial and perhaps above all,\nconfuddled.\nRees' Vladimir is the rock of the play,\ndrawing patience and resolve with a\nsoothing gentleness and warmth despite a mounting sense of desperation\nthat is repeatedly extinguished, albeit\ntemporarily. Matthew Kelly's Pozzo\nis wonderfully exuberant, an explosion of colour and sheer physicality in\nthe stark and confined world Mathias\npaints.\nThis is a Godot that is full of compassion and pathos. Other reviews have\nlauded the performances of individuals while deriding the play's accessibility and humanity. But Mathias has\nachieved a considerable feat in making\nsomething previously relatively elitist\nand obscure appreciable by the average individual while maintaining the\nintegrity of the original.\nIf the intention of all art is to communicate an idea, a vision, a mark, a\nscar, then surely artistic and commercial success is ideal?\nRegardless, if you're a serious the-atregoer, you'll probably have already\nseen it. If you only have a casual interest in theatre, Godot is not the impenetrable lump you may have expected.\nHurry though. The run ends in early\nApril...\nWait for me and I\u2019ll wait for you...\nDavid J Paw exorcises his English Literature demons with this wonderful rendition of Beckett\u2019s classic play\n\n"

    "content": "16 felix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors:\nMusic Editors: Alexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nAlexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com www.felixmusic.tk\nLocal\nNatives\nKadhim Shubber\nditches revision for\na night with Peggy\nand Local Natives at\nthe wonder that is\nHeaven\nL\nady Madonna, children at\nyour feet. For me, Abbey\nRoad Studios is the Lady\nMadonna of the music in-dustry, not only because,\ngrown from it, was the immortal piano\nriff that The Beatles recorded there,\nbut also because it\u2019s the house piano\navailable, for the fortunate enough\nto venture inside, to let their musical\nminds race on the same black and white\nkeys that graced the touch of Lennon\nand McCartney some 40 years earlier.\nThis phenomenon is both historically\nsignificant, and in current use, blessing\nevery pianist with its stories, which is\nexactly the way things should be.\nThere is a case to be made for preserving this marvellous creation behind glass frames and velvet rope so\nthat what has occurred within those\nfour walls is remembered forever.\nHowever, it is not a marvellous build-ing, it\u2019s a relatively average building for\nits surroundings in St. John\u2019s Wood.\nWhat has made it the beautiful landmark that it is are the things that have\nhappened within. As I see it, there is\nthe potential for far more incredible\nmusic to come out of what has become\nknown as Abbey Road, and surely, the\nbest way to have its history remembered forever would be to have history\ncontinually being made there.\nAlthough it\u2019s best known for much of\nThe Beatles\u2019 work, it should be known,\nas of the date that EMI was formed and\nthe studios became the centre of rock\nmusic in 1958, musicians such as: Cliff\nRichard, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Stevie\nWonder as well as everyone involved\nin the recordings \u2018Live From Abbey\nRoad Studios\u2019, have been key in making\nAbbey Road the legend that still turns\nits cogs.\nAs a nation, it has to be said that\nthere is poor effort put in to cherishing our musical heritage, if any at all.\nThe Hacienda in Manchester - gone,\nthe Astoria in London - gone. Cavern\nClub in Liverpool - a carpark, the Marquee Club in London, once the musical home of The Who - cleared for\nrestaurants and apartments. What has\nthis world come to? It may not be as\nold as the Colosseum or as grand as the\nHouses of Parliament, but in terms of\nhaving a direct influence over a large\namount of people across the UK and\nthe world alike, Abbey Road wins.\nAbbey Road was recently cast under\nthis shadow of uncertainty for its fu-ture, like many before it. February of\n2010 brought us the news that EMI had\nplaced the studios up for sale due to increasing financial issues, causing huge\ncontroversy over the protection of Abbey Road Studios. When news of luxury\napartments and a chance that Andrew\nLloyd Webber might buy in surfaced,\nthere sprouted a sudden change of heart\nby EMI. Deciding to keep the studios,\nwith a little help from its friends, Abbey\nRoad Studios will live on as an active\nrecording venue, waiting to pass on the\ngifts that it has shared so many times\nbefore, held within its four walls, to the\nfuture of music.\nSENNEN\nAGE OF DENIAL\nHUNGRY AUDIO\nSINGLE\nNow this I might actually listen to\nagain! In an age where apparently\neverything needs to be shocking to\nbe worth listening to, this will appear plain and boring but I like it. No\nsurprises, no auditory pain just easy-listening dreamy pop-rock. With you\nis the track of the album!\n- Emily Beech\nTHE SMOKING\nROLO SHOW\nROCKET\nSILENCE\nALBUM\nWith 20 members, at times this album is a little disjointed with so many\nstyles attempting to find an outlet.\nSome amusing song titles, \u2018As in Uffish\nThought\u2019, compliment the very strange\nsounds perfectly. QOTSA but much\nweirder is my diagnosis, slightly folky\nspaced out feel. - Emily Beech\nBEACH HOUSE\nTEEN DREAM\nSUBPOP\nALBUM\nIt\u2019s not often that you find a band who,\non their second album released a better record than their first and who\nthen with their third album, blow all\ntheir previous efforts out of the water.\nBut then it\u2019s not often that you find a\nband like Beach House who have so\nrigorously defined their own sound\nand then worked tirelessly to bring it\nto perfection. Which is what \u2018Teen\nDream\u2019 is: perfection. It transports you\nto a dreamy world of past loves and lost\nchildhood friends. Every song seam-lessly plays as part of the whole record\nbut are simultaneously complete structures of their own. I could write columns and columns about this album,\nit\u2019s the best record that I\u2019ve heard in a\nlong, long time. - Kadhim Shubber\nWhiney indie drawl is a fair descrip-tion. An introduction by Mr Churchill\ndoes not improve my opinion of them.\nDespite this lots of people will like\nthem; Zane Lowe named it the \u2018Hottest Record in the World Today\u2019. My\nlove for Zane Lowe is not enough to\nconvince me....Next!\n- Emily Beech\nSTATES OF\nEMOTION\nFIGHT THEM ON\nTHE BEACHES\nSINGLE\nJASON DERULO\nJASON DERULO\nWARNER BROS.\nALBUM\nPopular with MTV and previously at\nnumber 1 in the chart, Jason Der\u00fclo is\nproducing music for the masses who\napparently like it! It is catchy as sh*t and\nwill have the club singing along to every\ntrack. In fairness he is talented enough\nto create songs that will have half the\npopulation pinning him to their walls\nwhile the other half wish they had never\nheard the f*cking song. - Emily Beech\nE\nxams are only about 6\nweeks away and so I was\nseriously considering staying at home on the night\nthe Local Natives wowed\nHeaven nightclub. Instead, I grabbed\nmy coat and leapt out of my front\ndoor and forgot revision in a flourish\nof academic irresponsibility. My serendipitous reward? The musical joy\nof Peggy who happened to be supporting that evening.\nI felt vaguely uncomfortable because it\u2019s probably about time that\nPeggy Sue\u2019s musical career finally\ntook flight and moved firmly out of\nthe realm of lowly support acts. If\nyou didn\u2019t already know, Peggy Sue\nare 2 girls and a chap who play drum-heavy, accordion-infused folk music\nand they play it damn well.\nBut they were only the tantalizing\nappetizer so let\u2019s zoom quickly on to\nthe main dish. The Local Natives are\nan L.A. band with a fantastic debut\nalbum called \u201cGorilla Manor\u201d, who\nhave been compared with Fleet Foxes; which is about right; take Fleet\nFoxes out of the woods and throw\nthem on to a sunny drive down to\nMost listened to this week by\nFelix Music members on last.fm\n1. Bloc Party\n2. Florence + The Machine\n3. Radiohead\n4. Muse\n5. The xx\n6. FooFighters\n7. Gorillaz\n8. Yeah Yeah Yeahs\n9. Daft Punk\n10. The Beatles\nBloc Party are number one, they\u2019re lots of fun, now they\u2019ve begun, not being outdone, in the long run, I want a caramel bun. - Luke Turner\nthe beach, and add in a load of toe-tapping and hey presto, it\u2019s The Local Natives. But to be more serious,\nthe comparison with Fleet Foxes really comes from their use of multi-layered vocals to create beautiful, enthralling harmonies. Fleet Foxes do\nit with a very folk and country angle\nwhereas The Local Natives aim in an\nindie direction.\nUltimately, the prevalence of these\ncombined vocals mean that the band\nstand at the front of the stage four-abreast (with the drummer languishing unseen at the back) and belt out\ntheir lyrics as one, with no one band\nmember taking the traditional role of\nfrontman; which isn\u2019t so bad in my\nopinion. The set-up gives the band\na very strong presence that complements their powerful sound well;\nthey physically fill your vision and\ntheir sound envelopes your ears.\nBut I\u2019m not describing some loud\nhardcore metal band or a DJ with the\nbass turned up too high; the intricacies and deft little turns that litter\ntheir songs aren\u2019t overwhelmed. In\naddition, they move well between\ntheir few upbeat tunes and their\nmoody, chilled out songs where they\nexcel. So in summary, they were\ndamn good, so good in fact that\neven the stony-faced Hugh Crail\nwas compelled to whoop and cheer;\nwhich is saying something very powerful indeed.\nAbbey Road... Just\nLet It Be\nLuke Turner\nLuke Turner Music Editor\nLocal Natives\nHeaven\nFebruary\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nThey\u2019re local, native and lynching their bandmate.\n\n"

The fashion show has been\nreduced to an intimate presentation for selected members of the press and buyers. The 16 designs were penned by Lee\nMcQueen, and were about 80% finished at the time of his untimely death. The collection was inspired by the angels and\ndemons in the dark ages. The jacquard patterns were plated with gold; the fabrics were heavy to acheive a \u2018statue feel\u2019.\nThis collection will only be available bespoke for private clients. As the final model marched down the hall, she murmured\n\u2018There\u2019s no more.\u2019 And indeed, the presentation became the last chance for fans to mourn the tragic loss of a true talent.\nfelix Make Up and Beauty Lesson One - Primers\nCharlotteMorrisandKawaiWong\nCharlotteMorrisandKawaiWong\nS\nuffice it to say excitement isn\u2019t\nan element in the Parisenne\nlook book this season.\nDesigners head for the safe\noptions en masse, sticking to minimal-ism, hour-glass silhouettes and pretty\naccessories. Chloe, Celine and Stella\nMcCartney may well be condensed\ninto one house, after all, these three\nhave a closely woven history. Stella\nused to be head of Chloe, succeeded\nby her then assistant Phoebe Philo.\nPhoebe Philo then took over Celine a\nseason ago. Louis Vuitton has shown\nthe most unimaginative collection to\ndate. The 50s look - Grace Kelly style\n- no more, no less.\nJohn Galliano has run out of juice,\nthe new show is a compilation of all\nthe good old shows - Dior re-ran the\nequestrian theme from its Haute Couture collection. Galliano\u2019s own brand is\na mish-mash of his old flame of Czar\nglamour and clown-like brilliance.\nThe exhausting week culminated in\nChanel going nuts, putting Yetis on an\niceberg. A real iceberg shipped all the\nway from Sweden to Paris. How do the\nChanel people solve the logistics problem involved in negotiating a melty\nmountain through the notorious Parisian traffic? But then it\u2019s hard to take\nthem serious with a fur bodysuit that\nmakes you look like a mountain bear...\nThe real question is, can we blame\nthe designers? The designs were\npenned at the height of a global re-cession. Champagne is less frequently\nswigged; a night-out becomes a night-in. Sellability becomes directly proportional to wearability. While a full-on\ngrasshopper inspired dress dazzles at a\nparty, carrying on with daily activities\nis a completely different story.\nFashion is like restaurants, one\nof the hardest hit industries when\nthe economy goes south. Whenever\nmoney can be saved, why spend an\nextra penny? People automatically go\nfor safer options, for example, versatile skirts that can be worn Monday\nthrough to Friday, and a \u00a330 saving\nfrom the dry cleaners.\nCoats that are good quality and\ncan be passed down from generation to generation will prove a good\ninvestment too. So look at Burberry,\nHermes, Chloe - millions of different\nstyles of jackets and coats.\nIf you can count all the peacoats you\nhave seen this season, the drinks are\non me!\nOk, so we\u2019ve all heard of primers. Do\nthey really enhance your looks, or are\nthey just a useless waste of money? All\nmajor cosmetics brands now produce\na range of primers, from Mac to No.7,\nand you can pay as much or as little as\nyou like, but is it worth it?\nWhat are Primers?\nPrimers are usually silicon-based gels\nor creams. You put them on before you\napply your foundation. Many of them\nare SPF15, so they protect against the\nharmful UVA and UVB rays that age\nskin.\nWhy do you need them?\nThe first reason you\u2019ll need them is\nthat they help your foundation to stay\non for longer. Secondly, they smooth\nout the skin, so that the skin has an\neven-texture. Finally, they even out\nthe skin tone, neutralising red areas or\ndark circles under the eyes.\nThey are especially good for people\nwith oily and combination skin, as they\ntend to reduce the shiny, oily appearance of those problematic areas, like\nchins and foreheads.\nHow do you use them?\nPrimers can be applied in a similar way\nto liquid foundation. Smooth a thin\nlayer on your face with your finger,\nmotion downwards, going in the direction of growth of your facial hair.\nWhich one should you go for?\nAlthough the idea of primers is a fairly\nnew of concept in the world of makeup and beauty, there are a fair few on\nthe market, so which one is right for\nyou? The award-winning Smashbox\nPhoto Finish Primer (\u00a330/27.5ml,\nStrawberry NET Cosmetics) is oil-free\nand suitable for all skin types. It sinks\nin easily on the skin and feels gorgeous.\nA more accessible, middle-priced option is bareMinerals Prime Time\nfoundation primer (\u00a318/30ml, House\nof Fraser). It is made by the people\nwho advocate \u2018natural\u2019 make-up. It\u2019s\nfragrance-free, with no preservatives\nor fillers and contains extra vitamins\nto enhance your skin\u2019s natural health.\nThis is the perfect option for those\nwho have blemishes or sensitive skin.\nAnd if you\u2019re counting your pennies\nthis term, like me, you can go for No.7\nColour Calming Primer (\u00a310.25/40ml,\nBoots). This primer is available in lavender or green colours, and is designed\nto counter any colour imbalances in\nyour skin tone. The lavender colour\nworks against yellow, sallow colour\ntones, and the green is made to counteract red pigments in the skin, and\neach are aimed to brighten the skin,\nand also work excellently as primers.\nThe product is white\nbut as you apply it\non your skin it goes\nclear and it gets\nabsorbed quickly.\nIt leaves a thin\nlayer of satin-feel\nbase. The skin\nlooks healthy and\nmake-up stays on\nall-night. 2 pumps\nare enough to cover\nyour whole face.\nThis is slightly harder to apply\ncompared to many other primers. Its\ntexture is thicker and gooier, but when\na sponge is used, the primer actually\ngoes on fine. This primer is drier\ncompared to others, but this is due\nto its oil absorbent property, so it\u2019s\nKeeps foundation\nsmooth and in\nplace all day. Prime\nTime definitely\nhelps make-up look\nbetter. This primer\nhelps get rid of\nthe look that the\npowder is simply\nsitting on the skin.\nIt is non-greasy so it\nfeels comfortable to\nboot.\nSMASHBOX\nPHOTO FINISH\n\u00a330/27.5ML\nNO 7\nCOLOUR\nCALMING\nPRIMER\n\u00a310.25/40ML\nBEARMINERALS\nPRIME TIME\nPRIMER\n\u00a318/30ML\nperfect for oily skin\nand make-up can\nstay for hours.\nHowever, if your\nskin tends to get\ndehydrated easily,\nthis may not be the\nperfect solution for\nyou. The dry texture\nof the primer can\ncause make up to\ncrumble and crease.\nSo, know your skin\ntype!\nYSL Sues the Guardian Over\nStefano Pilati\u2019s Racist Comment\nYSLanditscreativedirectorStefano\nPilatiaresuingtheGuardianUKfor\n\u20ac150,000eachforcriminalandcivil\ndefamation.\nThenewspaperquotedacomment\nthatStefanomadetotheWashington\nPost:\u2018Youcan\u2019tfind[blackmodels]\nthatarebeautifulandwiththeright\nproportions\u2019.Hewentontosay,\u2018My\nfitmodelwasablackmodel.WhenI\nwantedtotranslatewhatIputonher,\nitwasadisaster.Itwouldneed13times\nmoreworkintheatelier...\u2019.\nThearticle,entitled\u2018America\u2019snew\nvogueforblackfashionisalldueto\nMichelle\u2019wasoriginallypublishedin\ntheObserver,theSundaypaperofthe\nGuardian.The webentryhassincebeen\nremoved.\nYSLandStefanoPilaticlaimedthatthe\nquotewasnotbeingusedintheright\ncontext.Stefanoneverdeniedmaking\nthosecomments.\nThecommenthascausedastorminthe\nblogosphere,withStefanoPilatibeing\nbrandedasa\u2018moderneugenicist\u2019.\nMcQueen\u2019s Last Show\n\n"

We really tested them in our first\nencounter narrowly loosing 2-1. In the\nsecond fixture we lost badly, 5-1 on a night\nreminiscent of Varsity 2009 where the\nmedics were torn apart by an impressive IC\nteam. Our final encounter was in the semifinal of the ULU cup where we matched\nIC over seventy minutes and into the final\nminute of extra time where we were beaten\nby an unstoppable goal.

    "content": "39\nfelix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk VARSITY PREVIEW\nTHEIR LEADING VOICES\nHow has your season been so far?\nWe\u2019ve had a strong year, not too much to complain about really other than a couple of slip ups.\nWhat has your experience of previous Varsities been like? Is this your first as captain?\nPrevious Varsities have always been very loud. I never really remember much of the games I play in.\nBut I do remember that we have lost three in a row while I\u2019ve been here. I was Captain last year, it\u2019s\nhard work, but good fun.\nHow does this match differ from the previous head to heads this season?\nI\u2019d say the gap between us has certainly narrowed over the last two or three years. Last year the\nMedics proved that they were still top dogs; however we got one over on them back in November,\nand then we drew in January. We\u2019ve certainly learnt a lot about each other with regards to how we\nplay so in that respect previous games are a massive help.\nHow much does your course get in the way of rugby? (and not vice versa!)\nAll in all it\u2019s not too bad. If anything gets in the way of Rugby then I just generally kick up a big fuss\nand act like a bit of a dick until I get my way. Sometimes it works, but on reflection its has nearly cost\nme a few friendships. Perhaps I should think of another way.\nAny thoughts on this year\u2019s 6 Nations?\nRegrettably, I think the French will take this one.\nDo you keep an eye on the other Varsity results, or is it all about the rugby? What\u2019s your\nfavourite?\nI\u2019ll have a look at all the results the next day, but generally I don\u2019t get to see too much of it. We\u2019ll wish\nthe other Rugby guys good luck before they play and try and watch as much of them as we can.\nRumor has it that College have two new mascots (yes, more grown men in animal suits) for this\nyear\u2019s Varsity... your thoughts?\nPerhaps the most memorable moment of Varsity last year was when someone nailed the Medic\nmascot. The head went flying and everyone saw that inside was dazed medic girl. Sad, yet funny. The\nattempt to bring alive the Medic Phoenix just looked like a big chicken. A good rule of thumb is that\nif it needs explaining it\u2019s not cool.\nDo you think Varsity is accessible enough to get the average student interested? A lot of people\nthink paying 8-10 quid to see a match between university teams can be a bit much.\nI certainly agree, I think it is a lot to ask. It\u2019s great that people come and watch, it really means a lot,\nbut you can go watch Premiership Rugby for the same amount. I suppose the University\nneeds to cover some of its cost and you get more than just a\nRugby game for your ticket. I would be very surprised if\nthe University turned a profit from days like this at the\nstudent\u2019s expense.\nLast but definitely not least, what are your post-match celebration plans?\nReynolds Bar!\nHow has your season been so far?\nVery good. We have secured promotion back into the BUCs premiership narrowly pipping Imperial\nCollege to the top spot. We suffered an early set back losing to our arch rivals at the beginning of the\nseason but have gone unbeaten since.\nWhat has your experience of previous Varsities been like? Is this your first as captain?\nThis is my first as captain. Last year is my only other experience of the occasion. It was an intense\nfixture which could have gone either way which made the elation of victory all the sweeter.\nHow does this match differ from the previous head to heads this season?\nIt\u2019s one match. What has gone before is of little relevance. We know we severely underperformed\nat the start of the season and have progressed steadily since then. The second fixture was a better\nmarker as the game had a Varsity \u201cWinner takes all\u201d feel to it provoked by the league situation. They\nhave simply confirmed that the game will be a tight affair.\nHow much does your course get in the way of rugby? (and not vice versa!)\nIt varies sometimes rugby is a welcome release, at others it can be a distraction. At the moment I\u2019m\ndelivering babies which is pretty intense so time management is reaching melting point.\nAny thoughts on this year\u2019s 6 Nations?\nFairlydisappointingfromanEnglishperspective.Itisuncleartomewhetherweareunderperforming\nor simply lack the calibre of player we once possessed.\nDo you keep an eye on the other Varsity results, or is it all about the rugby? What\u2019s your\nfavourite?\nI\u2019ll be passing a cursory eye over the other results. Women\u2019s rugby was pretty entertaining last year.\nRumor has it that College have two new mascots (yes, more grown men in animal suits) for\nthis year\u2019s Varsity... your thoughts?\nI pity the guys who have to get inside those things.\nDo you think Varsity is accessible enough to get the average student interested? A lot of\npeople think paying 8-10 quid to see a match between university teams can be a bit much.\nI wasn\u2019t aware of the price. That does seem a bit steep. Though\nthe crowd can hardly claim not to have got their money\u2019s\nworth in the last two years.\nLast but definitely not least, what are your\npost-match celebration plans?\nBack to the Reynolds.....trying to plan such events\nis futile.\nJAMES PETTIT\nCOLLEGE RUGBY 1ST TEAM CAPTAIN\nANDREW MOWAT\nMEDICS RUGBY 1ST TEAM CAPTAIN\nV\n\n"

This year, an unprecedented\nten sports will decide if College are\nstill sporting superiors to their Medic\ncounterparts across four venues, including a new venue for the flagship\ngame, next Wednesday.\nThe Medics are looking to finally\nbreak College\u2019s six-year unbeaten run\nat Varsity, but this may prove difficult.\nIn the past couple of years College\nhave won comprehensively overall, finishing 14.5 \u2013 8.5 ahead in Varsity 2008\nand then went onto improve score difference in 2009 with a 14.5 \u2013 7.5 win.\nThis year, Badminton Mixed teams\nhave been introduced to complement\nthe tradition Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s varsity at Wilson House.\nDespite College\u2019s dominance across\nthe majority of sports, the JPR Williams prize-winning game has always\nbeen out of College\u2019s reach. The JPR\nWilliams cup game is contested between College Rugby Men\u2019s 1st team\nand Medics Rugby Men\u2019s 1st team, and\nthe Medics have won every year since\n2003. The closest College have come\nto lifting the trophy was in 2008 when\nthey forced the Medics into extra-time\nat 19-19. Despite a battling display\nwhich saw Wales and British Lions 70s\nlegend and Medics alumnus JPR Williams commend the College team after the game, the Medics scrambled a\n22-19 win after converting a penalty in\nextra-time.\nThe Medics got back into the swing\nof winning comfortably last year with\na 15 -7 win.\nTighter than ever before\nCollege Rugby Men\u2019s 1st team captain James Petitt envisages this year\u2019s\nJPR Williams match a much tighter\naffair.\n\u201cI\u2019d say the gap between us [Medics\nand College 1sts] has certainly narrowed over the last two or three years.\nLast year the Medics proved that they\nwere still top dogs,\u201d he said.\nIf this season\u2019s meetings between the\ntwo sides is anything to go by, he will\ncertainly be correct. Two matches between them have been played this year\nand for the first time in years, College\nbeat the Medics last November. They\ncouldn\u2019t quite do the double over the\nMedics however and drew with them\nin the reverse fixture in January; a result that meant the Medics won the\nleague and return to Premiership next\nyear.\nAndrew Mowat, Medics Rugby 1st\nteam captain agrees the battle will be\nclose next week, but is unconvinced\nthat College can finally topple the\nMedics\u2019 Varsity crown.\n\u201cWhat has gone before is of little\nrelevance.\n\u201cThe first fixture against the College\nbrought a reality check as we turned\nout a weak performance and deservedly lost to the better team.\n[The results this year] have simply\nconfirmed that the game will be a tight\naffair.\u201d\nVarsity 2010 will test if College 1st\nteam\u2019s luck has run out as this rugby\nseason comes to a close. The task will\nbe made even harder as they look to\ndeal with the loss of Tom Carroll, their\ninfluential inside centre, but Petitt\nknows that if they are to complete this\nseason successfully, one that saw them\nfinish second in their SE1A league to\nMedics, it will be their own doing on\nthe night.\n\u201cThe lads have worked incredibly\nhard this season and are ready to top\nit all off, knowing full well that the only\nthing stopping them from the big win\nis their own mistakes.\u201d\nMowat rallying call is more of a mission statement and he gives off the impression nothing other than a win will\ndo.\n\u201cThe varsity match is the pinnacle of\nour season. It means a lot to the players to be involved and competition for\nplaces has been intense. Our aim is\nsimple. To win, preferably within the\nconfines of normal time, and retain the\nJPR Williams cup,\u201d he demanded.\nThe match will take place at a larger\nvenue than in previous years. London\nScottish\u2019s stadium Richmond Athletic\nAssociation Ground has been replaced\nby London Welsh\u2019s Old Deer Park for\nthe JPR Williams game. Old Deer Park\nstadium lies about a kilometre up the\nroad from Richmond Athletic Association Ground, but Head of Sport Imperial and principal Varsity organiser\nNeil Mosley promises the night to be\n\u201cthe biggest varsity ever.\u201d\nHe sees varsity as something to sa-vour. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 10 sports and a great\nnew venue..It really is unmissable for\nall Imperial students. If you have not\nexperienced the special varsity atmosphere before make sure you don\u2019t miss\nout,\u201d he said.\nVarsity kicks off on 17th March at\n10.30am at Ethos and Harlington with\nNetball 4ths and Hockey Women\u2019s 2nds\nopening the day\u2019s events at the respective venues. Badminton will take place\nat Wilson House sports hall, whilst the\nday will be capped off in Richmond at\nOld Deer Park when Rugby Men\u2019s 1sts\ngo to battle at 7.30pm.\nAs College rugby catches up with the Medics this season, will the\nMedics be able to topple College overall at Varsity 2010 next week?\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\n\u201cThe Medics are\nlooking to finally\nbreak College\u2019s six-year unbeaten run at\nVarsity, but this may\nprove difficult. \u201d\nfelixSport Varsity 2010 special\nSee pages\n32 -40\nMedics 2009 team captain Dan Neville kisses the urn of Michael Jackson as JPR Williams looks on. Bloody Medics....\nA\nUnited Nations Security Council report has found that\nnearly one-half of\nall food aid sent to Somalia\ndoes not reach those for whom\nit was intended.\nNearly \u00a3330m worth of food\nis sent to Somalia each year\nthrough the World Food Programme. The report alleges that\nthis aid is hindered by the programme\u2019s reliance for distribution on what\nit calls a corrupt group of cartels. The authors of the report call on the\nU.N. to open an investigation into the programme\u2019s operations in Somalia\nand to rebuild them. One distributor has been accused of staging hijacks\non his own delivery trucks, stealing food from these vehicles, and then\nselling this food on the black market. A large part of the problem with\nthe programme seems to be driven by Somalia\u2019s lack of political and military structure which makes donated food distribution by honest organisations difficult or impossible. Somalia\u2019s government is reportedly planning\nan offensive, headed up by General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, to control\nMogadishu. Kahiye\u2019s position until a few months ago was assistant manager at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Germany, but but he is reportedly held\nin high repute by Somali soldiers.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Tom Greany\nU\nS authorities arrested a woman who called herself \u201cJihadJane\u201d over a plot to kill Swedish artist Lars Vilks. The\nwoman, Colleen LaRose, was arrested as seven others in\nIreland were also arrested in connection with the plot.\nLaRose, 46, converted to Islam, fashioned her \u201cJihadJane\u201d pseudonym\nin YouTube videos and apparently had visited the region of Sweden where\nVilks lives. Vilks controversially drew depictions of Mohammed in the\nmanner of a roundabout dog, which is a popular form of Swedish street\nsculpture. These drawings were rejected from two Swedish exhibitions for\nfear of extremism, which then led to a debate in Swedish media over freedom of expression. Several newspapers went on to publish Vilks\u2019 work,\nsparking international fury, particularly in the Muslim world. Vilks is now\nliving is a state of high security, and carries an axe for extra protection.\nSweden\nI\nndia\u2019s upper parliamentary house voted to reserve one-third\nof all national legislature and state assembly seats for women.\nThe vote took place on Tuesday and was passed 186-1.\nThe bill was first introduced in 1996 and has been somewhat\ncontroversial ever since. India\u2019s first female Prime Minister was elected\nin 1966, and its first female President and female Speaker of Parliament\nwere both elected last year, but women represent only ten percent of the\nlegislature. This week, members of various parties who believe that the\nbill has not gone far enough to benefit minorities, Muslims, and lower\ncaste peoples withdrew themselves from the coalition government and\nwere forcibly removed from parliament. This development has threatened to bring the coalition\u2019s lead to a very narrow majority, which could\npossibly threaten the passing of other important bills. Critics claim that\nthe mandatory seats will favour wealthy women over poorer minorities.\nThe bill does not take effect until ratified by the lower house, approved\nby fifteen of Indian states, and also signed by the President.\nIndia\nSomalia\n\n"

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nclubs&socs.felix@imperial.ac.uk C & S\nfelix\nAmnesty for Fair Trade Fortnight\nF\nair Trade Fortnight (22 February-7 March) has recently\ndrawn to an end, and you\nmay be familiar with the Fair\nTrade movement. It aims\nto improve the lives of producers in\nthe developing world by paying them\nmore, as well as promoting higher\nsocial and environmental standards.\nWhere producers have in the past\nbeen exploited, Fair Trade aims to\nright wrongs and ensure producers\nare able to live well. A Fair Trade producer will be paid a greater and fairer\namount for what they produce and\nproceeds from sales of this produce\nwill also be put into community development \u2013 for example, scholarships\nand health care programs. Fair Trade\ncertification also ensures safe working\nconditions, greater environmental sustainability and more of an opportunity\nfor small producers to be heard. All\nsorts of goods have been certified as\nFair Trade, from bananas and coffee to\nwine and handicrafts.\nWhat you may not be aware of is how\nAmnesty International supports Fair\nTrade. Really, they go hand-in-hand\n\u2013 they are founded on similar principles of fairness and justice for all, even\nthough Amnesty does not explicitly\ncampaign on behalf of the Fair Trade\nmovement. For example, the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which\nAmnesty adheres to and cites in many\ncases of human rights abuses, states in\nArticle 25 that \u201ceveryone has the right\nto a standard of living adequate for the\nhealth and well-being of himself and of\nhis family\u201d. While the low wages and\npoor working conditions provided by\nsome unscrupulous companies conflicts with this fundamental human\nright, Fair Trade certification seeks to\nredress the balance by increasing wages and improving conditions. Amnesty\u2019s Demand Dignity campaign, against\nthe human rights abuses that go with\npoverty and social injustice, is another\nexample of a crossover between the\nprinciples of Amnesty and Fair Trade.\nAmnesty even sells items it rigorously\ncertifies as being Fair Trade in its shop.\nAs part of a programme of Fair\nTrade-related events to tie in with\nFair Trade Fortnight, Imperial\u2019s Fair\nTrade and Amnesty societies teamed\nup to put on a tea party. The evening\nbegan with a presentation on the Fair\nTrade movement, then moved on to\nthe more pressing matter of food and\ndrink. Copious amounts of tea, coffee and chocolate were served (all Fair\nTrade, of course!) and party-goers\nwere even treated to a fabulous view of\nthe sun setting from the physics common room.\nMoney raised from entry fees were\nsplit between the two societies, helping the Amnesty society on its way to\na spot on the leader board of Amnesty\nUK\u2019s Student Raise-Off, while a raffle\nof two hampers of Fair Trade goods\nhelped to raise both money and aware-ness. Everyone enjoyed themselves a\nlot and the evening provided much\nfood for thought (*groan*) - hopefully\nmany more at Imperial will be inspired\nto \u201cmake the swap\u201d to Fair Trade!\nFaiths Unite for Haiti\nIn an inspiring display of interfaith action, dozens of students, representing 8\ndifferent faiths and philosophical backgrounds, hit the London Underground\nfor the first event of Imperial Interfaith\u2019s Interfaith Charity Action Network\n(ICAN) initiative. Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim (Sunni and Shia), Sheikh, Christian\n(Catholic and Protestant) and Atheist students united for a common cause,\ncollecting money for the DEC\u2019s relief operations in earthquake struck Haiti.\nFrom an early start at 8 in the morning through to gone 9 in the evening, 6\nof TFL\u2019s stations were almost continually manned by enthusiastic volunteers\nand, 524 one penny pieces later, over a thousand pounds was raised for a\ngreat cause. Indeed several volunteers were actually approached by Haitians,\nwho commended them for their efforts, giving a moving personal side to so\nimpersonal a disaster.\nThis was the first of three interfaith events this month in aid of Haiti, still to\nfollow are an interfaith sports night (with massive sumo suits!) and a variety\nconcert. The organisers would like to express a huge thanks to all those involved\nin Wednesday\u2019s collection, hopefully the first of many successful interfaith\ncharity events!\nA never-ending buffet of laughs at IC?\nCharlotte Ivison gives us a preview of ICDramSoc\u2019s upcoming production of Michael Frayn\u2019s Noises Off, a brief\nhistory of British comedy and interviews director, Fran Buckland\nN\noises Off began as an\nidea Michael Frayn, a\nBritish playwright, had\nwhilst standing watching a performance of his\nfarce \u2018Chinamen\u2019 in 1970. He realised\nthat the play was actually funnier when\nwatching it from backstage, and so decided to write \u2018a farce from behind\u2019Noises Off.\nSince its conception in 1977, Noises\nOff has gone on to entertain thou-sands, being nominated for numerous\nTony and Drama Desk Awards and\ncausing one critic to say: \u201cIn Act 1, I\nlaughed. In Act 2, I hollered, and in Act\n3, I\u2019m pretty sure I left a bit of lung on\nthe back of my seat.\u201d\nThe plot centres around a troupe of\nprofessional actors who are doing a\ntour of the (fictional) show, Nothing\nOn, a bad carry-on type comedy set in\na country house and featuring scantily\nclad shenanigans, and uses the concept\nof \u2018play within a play\u2019.\nWe watch Nothing On from both\n\u2018backstage\u2019 and front of house as the\ndysfunctional cast and crew (complete\nwith love triangle) stumble through\nthe tour. They may be professionals,\nbut things soon start to unravel as offstage chaos affects on-stage performances with hilarious consequences.\nAct One sees the actors in a dress rehearsal the night before opening, still\nfumbling cues and forgetting lines, Act\nTwo sees them performing in a matinee show in the middle of the tour, as\npersonal conflicts lead to even more\nmayhem, and Act Three sees them\nperform at the end of the tour, when\neverything has gone so wrong that\neven they have noticed, and try to\ncover it up which just leads to even\nmore hilarity.\nCI: Why did you choose this play?\nFB: I chose a play that people would\nwant to come to, watch and enjoy \u2013\npeople can often be put off going to\nsee theatre because they think of dusty\nShakespeare tomes or modeplays trying to make political statements, and\nNoises Off is nothing like either of\nthese \u2013 it\u2019s just a bit of a laugh and\ngood entertainment.\nCI: What was your vision for it?\nFB: Noises Off is very well written\ncomedy and because of that, I didn\u2019t\nfeel that it needed to be too \u201cclownish\u201d \u2013 the text is subtle and sarcastic\n(we discover new jokes every rehears-al!) and so my vision was definitely\nto make the settings to feel as real as\npossible.\nFor the characters to be people who\nare so absorbed in their own actions\nthat they don\u2019t realise how stupid (and\nfunny) they look.\nCI: How has the experience been for\nyou - what advice would you give to\naspiring directors?\nFB: Plan ahead and make sure that\nyou can trust your producer! To direct a show takes a lot of time and effort and it is really important that you\nkeep in constant communication with\neveryone. It would be better to ask\nthis question after the show, because a\nweek before is always the hectic stage\nwhen you can\u2019t ever imagine the curtain going up successfully on the first\nnight... but I\u2019m really excited about it.\nThis play is going to be great.\nBritish comedic theatre through the ages\n1535- Nicolas Udall writes the first English comedy, Ralph Roister\nDoister, a play about a bragging soldier who tells amazing tales of brav-ery, makes love to numerous women, freely offers to fight when there\nare no opponents, and flees when there are.\n1592-1594- Shakespeare writes what is believed to be his first comedy,\nThe Comedy of Errors.\n1892- Oscar Wilde\u2019s Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan is first performed- a play\nwhich uses comedy to criticize the social codes of the time.\n1930- Noel Coward and Gertrude Lawrence star in the West End in\nthe Coward-written Private Lives, a comedy of marital complications.\n1958 - Harold Pinter\u2019s first West End play, The Birthday Party, a \u2018comedy of menace\u2019, closes in less than a week, but goes on to be considered\na classic.\n1982- Michael Frayn\u2019s farce Noises Off opens in the West End.\n\n"

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 12 MARCH 2010\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nhave a tendency for liking things\nother people don\u2019t.\nJames Blunt, for example.\nWhile other people might\nsheepishly admit to liking\nGoodbye, My Lover or 1973 after\nmuch persuasion and arm-breaking,\nI\u2019ll happily confess that I\u2019ve bought\nboth his albums and am anxiously\nwaiting on a third. Egg mayonnaise\nas a sandwich filling is another. Way\nback in primary school, none of the\nother boys and girls wanted to sit near\nme at lunchtime. They all thought \u2013\nand hoped \u2013 that I was dying of some\natrocious bowel disease. Even the\nteachers gave me a wide berth.\nAnother thing close to my heart is\nthe London Underground.\nNow, for someone who lives in London, and thereby uses the Tube, this\nmight seem like a very strange thing\nto say. They say that the one reliable\nthing about it is its unreliability, that\nthe only time the trains run on time\nis when you\u2019re running late, and that\nthey run a timetable you can set your\ncalendar to. But I don\u2019t care. I like the\nLondon Underground and I\u2019m not\nafraid to say (write) that.\nPerhaps I should explain:\nFor one thing, when you travel on\nthe Underground, you\u2019re not just travelling through space \u2013 you\u2019re travelling through time! (And faster than\nthe usual one second per second) A\ngood example of this is the Jubilee\nline. Start off at Stanmore in the wilds\nof Middlesex, a fairly ordinary station with a penchant for crosswords.\nBy the time you reach Westminster,\nyou\u2019ve arrived a hundred years in the\nfuture (though, paradoxically, still\ntwenty minutes late). With polished\nsteel and glass abound, and strange\ndoors between the platform and the\ntrains, it\u2019s the perfect setting for a\ncautionary tale of dystopian woe.\nKeep on going to Canning Town and,\nlike the scientist from The Time Machine, you\u2019ve travelled too far in time.\nThe majestic, Orwellian architecture\nhas been replaced by simple concrete\nblocks while Morlocks and the driverless tin cans of the DLR skulk nearby.\nThere\u2019s also the aspect of travelling\nitself. Everyone assembles on the plat-form, the train arrives, doors open,\nthe masses pile in \u2013 then silence! The\nsacred rules of the Underground,\nwhich must be obeyed, are that you\ndon\u2019t move, you don\u2019t talk and you\nespecially don\u2019t breathe. You\u2019re permitted to read the Metro or even a\npaperback if you had the foresight\nto bring one but heaven help you if\nyou dare start to laugh. Everyone retreats inside themselves like a clutch\nof socially inept tortoises. John Donne\nwrote that no man is an island; maybe\nso, but there\u2019s a very interesting archipelago chain in the next carriage.\nI actually find this rather amus-ing. For reasons even I don\u2019t entirely\ncomprehend, I have found myself riding the rails in quite bizarre apparel;\na vampire, a gangster and \u2013 worst of\nall \u2013 a tree, among others. I can tell\nby the way the other passengers furiously bury their heads in The Evening\nStandard that they are worried about\nme and my mental health. But it\u2019s simpler than that \u2013 they\u2019ve acknowledged\nmy presence and I find my existence\nratified. It\u2019s rather nice actually, to\nknow I exist.\nBut I think there\u2019s a lot of potential on the Underground. More than\nthree million people travel on the\nTube every day and most of them\ndo...nothing. Just think of what could\nbe accomplished with three million\nidle minds; professors and plumb-ers, bankers and buskers, solicitors\nand shop assistants. We could solve\nthe conundrums of our age: global\nwarming, the middle east and why\nexactly toast seems to land butter-side down.\nAnd Transport for London seems\nto be cottoning on to this as well. I\nsaw a poster in South Kensington\nStation the other day of Gandhi with\nthe quote, \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than\nincreasing speed.\u201d The idea behind\nthis was to provoke a philosophical\nreverie in commuters. And I strongly\nbelieve it will. That, or a murderous\nrage from passengers on the Circle\nLine.\nBut what I love most about the Underground is the mystery of it. Of all\nthe time we spend in those carriages\ndo we consider what\u2019s on the outside?\nIt\u2019s a brave new world on the other\nside of the Perspex, of disused tracks\nand abandoned stations, forgotten\nimprovements and remembered sew-ers. What I wouldn\u2019t give to go exploring down there, late at night after the\ntrains have stopped. Who knows what\nI might find? I\u2019m still banking on the\noutside chance that there\u2019s Nazi gold\nin a boarded-up station on the Piccadilly Line.\nSo I reiterate. I love the London Underground. Time-travel, philosophy,\nadventure!\nJust try getting any of that on the\nNo. 10 bus to Hammersmith.\nRhysDavisadmitshissoft-spotfortheTube\n\u201cThe sacred rules of\nthe Underground\nwhich must be\nobeyed, are that\nyou don\u2019t move,\nyou don\u2019t talk and\nyou especially don\u2019t\nbreathe.\u201d\nT\nhe night before writing this, I\nwent to see MTSoc\u2019s production of \u2018Hair\u2019 in the Union\nConcert Hall. And for your\nsake, I hope that the night after reading this you go see it yourselves.\nI realise, of course, that by indulging in\nsuch a shameless plug I leave myself open\nto charges of nepotism and insider trad-ing. I cannot deny my heavy involvement\nwith the dramatic side of life at Imperial,\nand I like to call myself a friend of many\nin the show\u2019s cast. But if there is any double dealing going on in these column\ninches, and if there are any interests that\nI am deviously trying to promote, then\nthose interests, devoted reader, are yours.\nThe opening night performance I attended was possibly the most powerful\nand moving theatrical experience I have\nenjoyed since coming to London three\nyears ago. I hope that my friends in the\nproduction will forgive me for setting the\nexpectation bar precariously high above\nthe Union bar, but I know from painful\nexperience that I can\u2019t be sued for expressing a personal opinion.\nSome others, I know, came out of the\nauditorium mildly impressed. Many\nemerged with the feeling of an enjoyable\nevening well-spent and there may have\nbeen one or two who would have preferred to be elsewhere. Mainly among the\ntechnical crew, I\u2019ll wager.\nI cannot, of course, speak for you. You\nmayloveit,youmayhateit,youmaywalk\nout halfway through the performance or\nskip down the aisle strewing flowers to\nthe cry of \u2018make love, not war.\u2019\nNow I have given you the legally mandated space to form your own opinions\nand indeed eagerly invited you to do\nso. There is now no power in the world\nwhich can stop me from saying that the\nexperience played chords of unbearable\nplangency on the sleep-deprived and\nmalleable clavinova of my emotions.\nArt has the power to inspire and intimidate in equal measure. And for understandable reasons, it is often artwork\nin one\u2019s own medium of choice that improves technique and encourages creative growth. On rare occasions, however,\neven the most reclusive kayaker charting\nhis own course along the creative gulf\nstream will come across detritus jetti-sonedfromsomeotherartisticcraft.And\nthe collision can be difficult to handle.\nAs an occasional writer, I use words\nand, once in a while, the odd dab of punctuation to lighten the monotony. Powerful tools, you would be tempted to think.\nDirect hand-me-downs from Shakespeare by way of Keats, Wilde, Shaw,\nNabokov and countless others. If the Old\nTestament\u2019s account of Genesis is to be\nbelieved, these are tools which predated\nand indeed generated the cosmos. Not\nbad equipment for an artist.\nBut then I turn the radio on. Or I catch\nthe end of a trailer advertising a new film.\nOr I stroll through an exhibition at the\nBarbican. Or I sit in during the opening\nnight of a stage musical.\nOne\u2019s own tools fade into insignificance when confronted with a supreme\nemotional experience. There is nothing\nyou can say, no words you could write,\nno pictures you could draw which rival\nthe message carried by a simple tune. No\nmusic which can recreate the impact of\nthe most delicate marble figurines.\nThe original GPS coordinates on this\npiece were set to bear left through a\ncontemplative account of the \u201860s hippie\nmovement before turning right in three\nhundred metres to a discussion of modern apathy and stopping in front of your\nfinal destination to urge you to vote in\nthe ongoing Union elections. But I have\nlost faith and interest in the power of lan-guage, and have neither time nor space to\nindulge you even if I wanted to.\nWhatever you do, Go Vote. Then Go to\nsee Hair. I\u2019ll see you there.\u2013\u2013\nGileadAmitwoulddiscussapathy,only...\n\u201cI hope that my\nfriends will forgive\nme for setting the\nbar so high above\nthe Union\u2019s\u201d\n\n"
