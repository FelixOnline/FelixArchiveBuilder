In his\nunselfishness he decided to resign\nfor the time being.\nSecondly, he was voted in fairly\nand secretly at aqu or at eUG M, and I fail to see how it can be\nassumed that the Miners, in\nparticular, voted for him.\nI hope that the Union is\ngrateful for the invaluable work\nwhich he has done so far.\nAll the best,\nIain Shacklock\nDear John, - Having been\ninvolved in Meet IC on\n\u2022 Wednesday 2nd May on the IC\nRag stall and having seen the\ninterest shown by the hundred or\nso residents who attended the\nfunction. I feel that it would be\nmuch more desirable if this event\ncould be extended, possibly over\nseveral days. This would enable\nthe college not only to encourage\nmore local residents to attend, but\nalso to invite representatives from\ndifferent companies with a view to\ninteresting them in employing\nstudents from IC. It should also be\npossible to allow the students to\nio ok around the exhibition, which\nobviously took a lot of time and\neffort to prepare, to let them get a better idea of what is happening\nin other departments.\nThis, I think, would be\nvaluable both for the college and\nfor the visitors.\nYours sincerely,\n(love and Kisses)\nTansy Hepton\nDear Sir, - I object to being\ntreated as an imbecile each time a General Election comes round. I knew that my vote would have no\neffect on the result in my\nconstituency as a Conservative\nMP was bound to be returned\nwith an increased majority. How\nmuch longer will the intelligent\nvoter have to put up with a situation where there are over 400\nsafe seats in which his/her vote is\nbound to be wasted?\nOf course, now that a Tory\ngovernment has been returned\nwith a substantial majority, there\nwill be no further mention of\nelectoral reform for five years\nsince they do not need to rei y on\nLiberal votes to maintain a majority. The cruel irony is that if\nwe had had proportional\nrepresentation at this election, the\nLiberals would have had about 90\nseats and would, in fact, hold the\nbalance of power.\nWe need to restore to people\nthe sense that their vote counts, no\nmatter who is cast for. The 'first-past-the-post' system merely leads\nto negative voting whereby\npeople do not vote according to\ntheir true convictions.\nYours, etc\nRichard Earl Physics PG( Laser Group)\nBlackett Laboratory\nDear John, -1 would like to thank\nMr Mooney and his staff for their\nefforts at the RCS Annual dinner.\nThey gave me a lovely meal, even\nthough I am a 'difficult'\nvegetarian.

    "content": "Page 12\nREVIEWS I Spirits Having Flown - Bee Gees (RSO)\nIf the title of this record is any comment\nupon the musical content then I tend to agree,\nthere does not seem to be much 'spirit' in the\nmusic.\nThere is a great temptation to slang any\nnew piece of music from the Bee Gees, if\non iy because of the sickness affecting critics,\nbeing that the approval of the music press\nmust be inversely proportional to the group's popularity with the record buying public.\nHowever in this case, I think that a lot of the\ncriticism levelled at the Gibb Brothers is\ndeserved. 'Spirits Having Flown' is unoriginal,\nlacks variation and shows the brothers as\nbeing totally un creative. I believe that this\nalbum is a waste of talent, which the Gibbs\nsurely have.\nIt seems that following the success of\n'Saturday Night Fever' the Bee Gees 'rightly'\ndecided that there was more money to be\nmade from following that blue-print.\nIn general this album can be very well\nsummed up by a phrase used for describing\none of Elton John's albums, by a non-understanding mother 'But it all sounds the\nsame'. Having heard the singles you don't need to listen to the LP. But perhaps this is an\nunfair generalisation, there is a defina te variation in tempo, some songs are fast,\nothers slow. Also there is one moderately\npleasing track, at the end of the entire album,\n'Until', which is two minutes and twenty-five\nseconds long, the vocals are harsher, not so\nhighly-pitched, disco-beat is absent (in fact it\nis difficult to detect any beat at all) and pleasant use is made of a string section. Much of\nthis songs mediocre success though must be\ndue to its brevity.\nHaving been a mite vitriolic above, let's get\nonto the good points. The Bee Gees know\nhow to sing, they hit every note exactly, and if\nyou don't get very irritated by their insistence\non singing falsetto, the harmonies stick\ntogether very well. The majority of the songs\nhave a highly formula rize d structure,\nconsisting of a short chord sequence\nrepeated continuously throughout the song,\nwith an adequate, if unimaginative, rhythm\nlaid down on the drums, not forgetting the\nsqueaky vocals; all excellent disco material,\nand very catchy tunes. There is one\noutstanding sax solo, from Gary Brown\nRECORDS( unfortunately only outstanding due to the\nquality of the rest of the music, it would not\nstand up against anything played by the\nvenerable Grover Washington Jnr or any\nother saxophone master), which occurs\nduring 'stop, think again'.\nIt is hardly surprising that no word sheet is\nsupplied with the album, unless it was printed\nwith very large letters not much of the sheet\nwould be filled, and as for the lyrical content,\nevery song on the record is a love song, and\nmostly of the type Boy-loves-girl, girl-no-longer-loves-boy . I am still trying to work out\nwhat is meant by the lines:\nI did not realise that it was possible to climb\nlove.\nThe main criticism of 'Spirits' is that it is\nvery similar to previous material that the Bee\nGees have produced, and that most tracks on\nthe album are extremely alike. I also happen\nto find their squeaky singing decidedly\nirksome.\nThis sort of music is eminently suitable for\npiping into a cafe, as background music to\nslurping coffee.\nChris Watts\nTENNIS\nOn Saturday the 1st VI had\ntheir first outing ol the year with\nan away match against Wycombe\nHouse. Being unable to secure\nACC Transport the team and an\nAZ trotted o if toO ster ly by tube.\nOn arriving on the great West\nRoad we were told where to go by\na smart girl in a sports car and had\nto ask someone else the way.\nWe set off to groans from the\nsecretary who did not want to\nwalk owing to a rough Friday\nnight. As we walked, we\nmarvelled at the large planes in\nthe sky, and exclaimed 'isn't nature wonderful'. Then, wait for\nit, concorde (chorus of trumpets).\nTraffic ground to a halt, a pram\nran into a tree and O 'Boyle fell\nover (he too was not feeling his\nbest).\nAfter such excitement the\nwhole was ready for anything and\nwe soon found Wycombe House\n(credit to Sean who had the\nbook). Owing to the rain we had\nto look elsewhere for dry courts.\nHappily Osterly is a mating\nground for tennis courts of all\nbread and colour and we were\nsoon playing on the local council\ntarmac courts.\nThe match progressed to a happy ending (like all stories\nshould) with only one short break\nfor rain, IC winning by 11 1/2 sets\nto 6 1/2. Everyone played well at\ntimes, though almost everyone\nwas afflicted with nerves, lack of\npractice and the effects of the\nprevious night, especially Sean\nwho shall remain nameless.\nAn excellent tea followed with\nthe team contriving to finish\nevery last mor c el.Se an threatened to spoon up the jam but we got a lucky reprieve.\nIn conclusion, it was an\nexcellent start to the season with\neveryone enjoying the summer\nsport of bombarding their\nopponents as hard as they could.\nSimon Middelboe\nThe Team: Adrian Clarke\nDavid Cornwell\nSimon Middleboe\nSean O 'Boyle\nNoori .Nounhargh\nDave Green\nIC 1st XI v South Stanmore\nJCRICKET IC 2nd XI v Chelsea College 1st The 1st XI finally found\nopposition of their own standard.\nSouth Stan\">ore fielded an\nunhealthy looking bunch of\nPensioners who might have been\nmore at home in a cardiac ward.\nToplis won the toss and\ngenerously invited South Stanmore to bat. Early on the\nwheelchairs got rusty in the rain\nand even Stantiford was quick\nenough in the field to produce a run-out. After this Ellacott was\nable to rip through their batting\nwith his slow left-arm leg-breaks.\nHe finished with 6 wickets. Two of\nthese wickets fell to lucky slip\ncatches by Pitts whose nose is\nsharper than his reactions.\nMeanwhile Chadband had lulled\nthe opposition into a false sense\nof security and picked up a wicket\nthanks to a magnificent full-length, one handed catch by\nMano Mylvalganan. There was\nalso another run-out and South\nStanmore declared at 60 for 9.\nThis declaration was an obvious mistake as Stantiford was out to\nprove that he is the luckiest\nbatsman in college. A series of\ndropped catches and edged shots\nmeant that he managed to reach a fluky 43 runs in a first wicket stand\nof 61 with Mylvalganan. The latter\ncomplained bitterly that St anti ford had' farmed the bowling'. Farming was an\nappropriate term for Stantifords\ninnings.\nThe outcome of this afternoon\nof fun and gaiety was, therefore, a win for IC by ten wickets.\nSpeaking as an impartial observer, I can only say the first\neleven had the luck of the gods\nand obviously needed to promote\nkey members of the 2nd XI.\nSouth Stanmore: 60 for 9 dec\nIC: 61 for O Result: Narrow victory\nRock Minton\nThe Original Sports Journalist\nP.S. Any resemblance to real fact\nin this report is purely\ncoincidental.\nSkipper Furnish started the day\noff as he meant to go on - badly.\nHe arrived late but we would have\nbeen better off if he had not come\nat all. After demonstrating his\ntalents as ace to s ser, he\nmisguidedly elected to bat. The\ntwo opening batsmen offered an\ninteresting contrast in style.\nMorton looked the classical\nstraight bat whilst Kenrick would\nhave been more at home in a hay\nbarn. Somehow Ken rick cultivated 34 runs in an impressive\nlooking opening stand of 69,\n(so ix ante neuf to you Hewkin).\nFurnish then came to the\ncrease. The quickest thing he did\nall day was to leave again after an\nedgy 5 runs. The day was saved by\nJohn (I didn't miss out this time in\nOxford) Care. With his classy\nforward defensive swipe over mid-wicket managed 28 not out.\nAt this stage Furnish made a huge blunder. He declared at 144\nfor 2 depriving IC of certain\nvictory, and, more importantly,\ndepriving the excellent Morton of\na certain century. Morton had to\nsettle for a meagre 73 not out.\nThe IC bowling was opened by\nDean and Wyatt. Their opening\nattack had the penetration of a wet\nrice-pudding. The joke was\ncarried to a farce by introducing\nCare to the fray. The three\nbowlers bowled a mixture of full\ntosses and long-hops and it was\nno surprise when Chelsea raced\nto 146 for 3 to win. Care blamed\nthe fielding and saved some\nspecial abuse for Morton who missed a stumping. It should be\npointed out, however, that Morton\nwas so surprised by Care's straight ball (his rare speciality)\nthat the thought of a stumping\nwas far from his mind.\nApart from the appa ling captaincy, the only other note a bie feature of the game was the subarctic conditions. The teams were\ncontinually on and off the pitch\nand this obviously spoilt the IC\nteams concentration which may\naccount for the defeat.\nIC : 144 for 2 declared (very\nsporting)\nChelsea: 146 for 3\nResult: Lucky win for Chelsea.\nRock Minton\n\n"

The contest started at\n11am, and yours truly was lucky enough to draw Geoffrey Donald\nStokes Keymer, the defending champion, in the first match of the day\n(needless to say that I got hammered). Mr Keymer, in fact, had it easy for\nmost of the day until he got to the semi-final and met a very on-form\nDave Crossland. He scraped through 2-0, and at 11pm, the first frame of\nthe final started. Mr Keymer's opponent was Keith Underwood, from\nGuy's Hospital, who had played steadily and well all day. Keymer,\nfeeling the title so close, played casually for the first two frames, and lost\nboth of them, Keith Underwood taking all the chances that were\npresented to him. In the third frame, however, Geoff asserted himself,\nand won 90-8. The fourth frame was nail-biting, eventually going to a black ball shoot-out. Keymer succeeded in potting the black after\nUnderwood narrowly missed a long pot. And so everything depended\non the fifth and final frame, and once again Keymer asserted himself,\nand won convincingly. So at 1.15am, Sunday morning, I handed Geoff\nthe first prize of \u00a310, and he became the first student to successfully,\ndefend his title.\nI would like to thank the following staunch members of IC Snooker\nClub, who refereed matches and helped me get everything ready for the\ncontest: Mark Cherry, Martin Proudlove, Alex Cameron, Gareth Machin,\nSteve Jeans, Geoff Keymer and John Healy.\nClub Matters: There will be a joint\ncommittee meeting on Wed 16th May in the Union TV Lounge at\n1pm. Any member of the club is\nwelcome, but may only speak at\nthe Chair's discretion (this is not a general meeting). Among the\nitems on the agenda are the\ndiscussion of the estimates of\nexpenditure for next year, and the\nhanding over of power to the new\ncommittee.\nOther Matters: As of last week, a new system of booking the table\nhas been in action.\nIt gives all members a better\nchance to book the hours they\nwant so after the exams, why not\ncome and have a nice relaxing\ngame of snooker? Next year, I hope to field 3 teams to play\nagainst other London Colleges. If\nyou would like to play in any one\nof them, why don't you come up\nand see me some time? Unlike\nprevious years, everyone will be\ngiven a chance to play in a team if\nthey are good enough, not only a selected few.

IC entered\ntwo teams, Al st team and an\nA team, which were drawn in separate leagues.\nThe1 st team easily qualified\nfor the later rounds, winning every match in their league.\nMeanwhile the A team lost\nunfortunately to a united hospitals team, after too long in the bar at lunchtime, so they\nfinished runners up in their\nleague.\nThis meant IC1 st vIC A in one semi final and United Hospitals v Chelsea College in\nthe other. Our semifinal was something of a needle match with ICl sts eventually prevailing.

However when a team possesses such a lethal\nmarksman as James Rowley the normally exhausting tasks in\na game become a pleasure.\nThus it was with great confidence that IC IV faced this top of the\ntabi c clash against league leaders Goldsmiths III. Even 'preacher of\ndoom' Bill CafTyn was forced to admit before the game that given the\nright conditions we might actually win. When the rest ofthe team heard\nthat Bill had given the ok, confidence reached a peak.\nSo it was that the full strength IC team took the pitch against the\nteam that had beaten them 4-0 earlier in the season (to work up some\naggression Bill CafTyn told some jokes before the game).\nJames Rowley went close very early on when he stole between two\ndefenders only to be foiled by an excellent reflex save by the Goldsmiths\ngoalkeeper. Minutes later O 'Kelly outsmarted the opposition's right\nback and his cross (somehow) found John Shuttleworth (FELIX Editor\nelect) who scored easily. Another O 'Kelly pass was measured into\nRowleys path and he made no mistake when he rounded the keeper and\nslotted the ball in.\nThe third goal came when a Goldsmith's goal kick went\nstraight to Rowley who volleyed\nthe ball past the shocked goalie\nfrom 30 yards. This goal typifies\nthe quick thinking and excellent\ncontrol which is such a large part\nof Rowley's vital contribution to\nthe team.\nRowley finished his first half\nhat-trick after some good work in\nleft midfield by recent acquisition\nGlen Millar. From a corner\nGoldsmiths snatched a late first\nhalf goal that even the athletic\ngoalkeeper Witts [joint IC\nfootballer of the year) failed to\nstop.\nJust before halftime Shuttleworth (injured in a tackle)\nwas replaced by Nick Matthews\nwhose positive and decisive runs\nwere at the centre of many ofthe\nsecond half attacks.\nIn the solid IC defense, Steve\nVeats returning to his natural\nposition as centre half, was most\nnoticeably in control,particularly\nin the air against a swilling w ind\nand the Goldsmith's attack (in\nthat order).\nDespite their near total control\nand with the help of goal shy\nO 'Kelly and Marten, IC added\nonly one goal in the second half\nwhen a good combination of\nMatthews and Rake put Rowley\nthrough for his fourth.\nSo Imperial came out victors by\n5-1, a score line which in no way\nflattered them, in particular on\ntheir first half performance.This\nwas the teams 8th win the last 10\ngames, scoring 47 goals in the'\nprocess. James Rowley has now\nscored 20 league goals in his\nseason's total of 39! A point of\ninterest is that player-manager\nOkelly would not deny that Brian\nClough had been in touch about a possible James Rowley - Trevor\nFrancis swap. He did however ask\nto be quoted when he said. James\nRowley Is an IC I]' player. This\nsituation will continue until Ihe end oj\nthe season. After that we are open lo\noffers.\nTeam:- Harry Wills. Rill Caffyn.\nXeil Morris. Sine Veats. Phil Lakin\nleapt). Glen Millar. Steve Marten.\nKeith Rake. Paddy O 'Kelly (player-manager). James Rowley. John\nShultlrworlh. sub: Xick Matthews.\nIC IV 2 v1 RHC III\nFourths out-witt Holloway With a masterful display of goal keeping agility, Barry Witts\nplayed perhaps his best game of the season to help IC IV to\nvictory by 2-1 against RH C III. The co-holder ofthe Manheim trophy was called upon on many occasions to make brave saves\nfrom the onrushing RH C forwards, and he was not found\nwanting!\nThe day started with the usual haggling over players in the\nUnion lounge. Experienced manager O' Kelly thought afterwards that his most major contribution to the game was in fact to field 11 players, though this could not have been done\nwithout cooperation from IC1 captain Kevin Reeve. Thanks Kev! Before the game, goalkeeper Witt s produced a glorified mug\n( which he claimed was the Manheim trophy) and an in st amati cso we posed for photographs and when we finally decided what\ncolour we wanted to play in, the game got under way.\nPlaying against a strong win d,IC were unlucky not to take an early lead when O' Kelly hit the bar with a speculative attempt and Hanke hit the post from the rebound. The goal that IC wanted came midway through the first half when Hanke collected the ball and raced past the Holloway defence striking\nthe ball firmly into the corner of the net.\nThen there was a sudden sharp\nchange in the weather causing\npainful sheets of sleet to be driven\ntoward the IC goal mouth. This\nproduced almost constant pressure on the IC defence for the\nrest of the half since the IC forwards found it difficult to run\ninto the sleet without closing their\neyes (though some would claim\nthat the 'les y eux ferm es' technique is an essential feature of\ntheir play anyway!)\nHaving survived the first half\nwith a10 lead, IC were\ndes appointed to find that the\nwind had died down so that\nHolloway were not faced with any\nmeteorological problems in the\nsecond half. However in the first\n20 minutes of this half. IC played\ntheir best football and after\nHanke. Millar. O' Kelly and\nRowley had all gone close. Keith Rake made no mistake from a through ball by Rowley and IC\nwent into a20 lead. Deservedly\nHolloway began to fight\nback( not always fairly) and they scored a well taken goal with about ten minutes left to\nplay. However they never\nlooked likely to equalise and indeed it was fitting that\nImperial were on the attack\nwhen the final whistle was blown. So yet another win for I CIV, which makes nine wins in the\nlast eleven games, bringing them even closer to the top of\nthe table and a possible league title.\nTeam:- Barry Wills, Neil\nMorris, Bill Caffyn, St ev e Veals,\nPhil Lakin (cap l). Glen Millar,\nJames R owl ey, Kei lh Rake,\nPaddy O 'Kelly, Tom Hanke,\n,\\'i ck Mall h ews.\nBalliol College, Oxford\n180 for 6 declared\nFor a match due to begin at 2.15, 2.00 arrived and found only 9 IC\nplayers at Balliol and Just 1 member of the Oxford team. The four latest\narrivals from IC therefore wisely elected to sample the local\nBrakespears and less local Wadworths. At 2.30 all of both teams were\npresent, Maqulre and Salter having caught a stopping train from\nPaddington.\nIC won the toss and having barely examined the wicket but closely\nexamined the batting line-up, Balliol were asked to bat.\nSalter was conned into acting as wicket keeper for the day and spent\nhalf the afternoon re-enacting a stumping once performed when he was\n16; unfortunately whilst the batsman's feet were firmly in the crease.\nDespite the odd extraneous appeal from the slips it wasn't until the\nOxford College were 98 without loss that a half-hearted question from\nBunten received a dubious Ibw decision to remove one of the openers.\nBalliol now pressed on more quickly, and IC did well, with a bowling\nattack mainly from Care and Wyatt, who took 2 wickets each, and sharp\nout fielding to contain the opposition to 180 for 6 when the declaration\ncame.\nImperial College 2nd XI 60 for 7\nMatch Drawn.\nIC had 55 minutes plus 20 overs to reach the target, and never really\nhad a chance to chase the total, losing opener Smith, unluckily to\nanother dubious decision, in the 3rd over. Uncharacteristically Furnish\nhad scored 9 when the IC total was on 9, but then managed to avoid a straight ball on middle stump, so that he could do some umpiring. More\nIC wickets fell quickly, but some solid batting from Bunten and Wyatt,\nand later Maguire, saw IC through to the close.\nIn the bar we congratulated ourselves on allowing 2 opposition\nplayers to score 50, and another to take 5 wickets, as this gave them the\nprivilege of each buying a jug of their excellent Hook Norton brew.\nWe finally left by British Rail and car between 9.00 and 10.30, when\nCare, Wyatt and Bunten proved how hard they had played by failing to\nraise enough energy to push start the captain's car, so that he was\nforced to use the subtle method of cleaning the spark plugs.\nTeam: M Furnish, P Smith, J Care, Ft Clothier, A Bunten, D Salter, E Manors, T Wyatt, P Maguire, D Fenton, D Heath(!)\n\n"

The threat came in a letter\ncomposed of words cut from\nnewspapers. It read: \" Mary roars back at her old friends.\nLook after your fire engine.\nNext on the list? We will win in the long run\". Mary is Q MC's mascot, kidnapped by IC students earlier this year.\nExecutive members were\nfurious because J ez, the R CSU fire engine, is an inviolate\nmascot. Deputy President\nMalcolm Brain told a Union\nmeeting that he would report to\nthe police any attacks on J ez. R CSU President Chris Fox visited QM C Union on Tuesday\nafternoon and spoke to their\nVice President Nigel Woodcock.\nHe explained which of IC's mascots could be raided and\nwhich were inviolate, and in formed him that any action\nagainst J ez would be regarded\nas criminal. Nigel Woodcock\nsaid that he would look into\nthe matter and consider making\na contribution to the cleaning\nof the lions.\nThis is the second time this\nyear that the lions have been\npainted. On 8th December they\nwere found covered in red paint\nwhich was removed by College\nworkmen before it had a chance\nto dry.\nNews in Brief continued on\nback page.\nIt is now possible to remove a Departmental Representative from\noffice. The By-Law change had its second hearing at last Tuesday's UGM. To dismiss a Dep Rep it is necessary to draw up a petition with at\nleast 10% support from that department and present this to the Hon Sec\nof ICU who will then call a general meeting of the department where a discussion will be followed by a ballot.\nThis change was necessary because there was previously no method\nof ousting Dep Reps from their posts.\nAlso past its second reading was a clause stating that the UL U Rep,\nFELIX Editor and Union Publicity Officer should be permanent\nobservers on Council.\nSome confusion reigned over\nJeremy Farrell's amendment to\nthe Standing Orders. This was in\nfact designed to clarify previous\namendments to the standing\norders.\nThe original changes concerned the right to speak for and\nagainst procedural motions but\nwas not clearly worded and this\namendment was aimed at\nrectifying the situation.\nThe proposed change was\neventually withdrawn to be\n\u2022discussed at a later date.\nOnly six people stood for P WP so no election was required and\nMike Elkin must surely be\ndisappointed at missing an\nopportunity to demonstrate his\nskill with STV. The six ratified\nwere Gary Dearmer, Mick Berry,\nMark Clegg, Tansy Hepton, David\nLyons and Colin Palmer.\nJohn Passmore was ratified as\nExternal Affairs Officer for the rest\nof this session.\nTim Hillyer was elected at the\nU GM by a show of hands, in\npreference to the absent lain\nShacklock, and will be joined on\nthe E AC by Kevin Courtney,\nratified as Ordinary Member.\nNo candidates were fully\nnominated for Union Finance\nCommittee, Union Publicity Officer and the Publicity Officer of\nthe External Affairs Committee.\nThe one ballot taken was for\nUnion House Committee where\nfour candidates were contesting\nfor three places. Those elected\nwere J Tidy, M Town and M Wiszowaty.\nBarry Austin spoke to his\nmotion withdrawing support from\nthe National Abortion Campaign\nand putting a motion to UL U Student Representative Council\nto do likewise. Mr Austin explained with a visual aid that\nabortion late in pregnancy was\n'abhorrent'.\nAn amendment proposed by\nBryan Smith deleting previous\nUnion policy was narrowly\npassed. A second 'delete all and\ninsert...' amendment proposed by\nKirsten Pratt urged that ICU write\nto NAC voicing our disapproval at\nlate abortions but did not\nadvocate UL U withdrawing support. This was defeated and\nthe main motion carried despite a speech against from Merche\nClark.\nICU President Mary Attenborough said afterwards that\nbecause the U GM was so poorly\nattended and immediate action\nwas required by this motion she\nwould be recommending to\nCouncil that they refer this back to\na future U GM. Iranian Society proposed a motion deleting all previous\npolicy on Iran, calling on ICU to\nsupport the Iranian Revolution\nand condemn discrimination\nagainst Iranian students in\nBritain.\nAn amendment proposed by\nTony Cox was passed which\nridiculed the original motion, but\nbefore a vote could be taken\nKirsten Pratt challenged the\nquorum and the show ended.\n\n"

It was also transmitted\nby IC Radio from 1.00 to 8.00\nam on both nights, and IC Radio\nstaff were proud to hear their\nstation identifier included in\nthe broadcast every 15 minutes\nthroughout the night.\nThe IC Radio volunteers\nprovided mainly \"hands off\"\nproduction back-up in several\nshifts throughout the programme.\nIC Radio Station Manager John\nAllen put in a total of 30 hours\nincluding both nights, providing\nassistance to Radio London' s producer David Carter. Other\nstudents answered telephones,\nmanned reception and showed\nparties of visitors around the\nstation.\nThe programme has as its\naim the raising of money in an\nappeal for the Year of the\nChild. Over \u00a310,000was pledged\nduring the programme. The\nmoney will go into a fund administered by , the Marylebone\nRotary Club to be distributed\namong children's charities.\nThroughout the broadcast\nlisteners phoned in and pledged\nmoney in exchange for dedications, re guests and gifts. A number of items were auctioned\nincluding a signed cricket bat\nwhich raised \u00a3150.\nSeveral show business guests\ntook part including Dickie Henderson, Tony Blackburn,\nSimon Bates, and Lorraine\nChase, who helped by donating\nmoney or gifts. Actor Richard\nBriers of the \" Good Life\" donated his trousers.\nMuch of the programme was\nchat, records were played, and\nmusicians performed live on the\nair.\nMany of those involved worked hard for hours at a time. John\nAllen said afterwards that he\nwas very happy with the way it\nhad gone. IC Radio staff had\ngained useful experience.\nFees Rise Protest\nThe External Affairs Committee is calling for a lobby of\nthe College Governors following\nthe recently announced rise in\ntuition fees.\nThey want the College to\nstop charging overseas students\nmore than home students and to\nset up a hardship fund for\nstudents who cannot meet the\nnew fees.\nThe Governors' Finance and\nExecutive Committees are meeting on 25th May and tuition fees\nis on their agenda. The lobby\nwill be outside 170 Queens Gate\nfrom 10.30am. The External Affairs Committee will also present the Governors with a petition signed by students\nbacking their demands.\nThis action follows a month\nlong campaign against fee in creases last term.\nColour Lunchbreak\nSTOIC( Student Television of Imperial College) broadcast\ntheir first major television programme in colour yesterday.\nThe production was their regular\nlunch break programme.\nThis has been made possible\nfollowing the purchase by the\nCollege TV Studio of a colour\ncamera and editing equipment\nwhich is available to STOIC.

Either way the rents would go up, but this way IC\nhangs onto Evelyn Gardens for another 70 years.\nMeet IC Day\nRumours abound as to the cost of \"Meet Imperial College\". Fortunately the often-quoted figure of \u00a370,000 was\ntotally inaccurate, the final figure being about \u00a31500. With\n200 guests in all I'm sure that relations between us and the\nresidents will have been improved.\nIt does seem a pity, though, that very few students had a chance to visit the displays or see the Sherfield Building\ndecked with flowers. A one-afternoon event does not do\njustice to the effort and hard work put in by the staff. Perhaps if it had lasted longer more residents would have been\nable to come and more students could have appreciated the\nwide range of academic/recreational facilities IC has to\noffer.\nFELIX Election\nAt last! A contested post for Photographic Rep on the\nCommittee. The election will be held at 12.30 in the FELIX Office today.\" All members are urged to attend and vote.\nICU Handbook\nThe copy deadline for all articles for next year's Handbook is June 10th. All clubs and societies, Union Officers\netc who have something to say to next year's intake should\nhave their copy (typed please) in by then at the very latest.\nWhat a week!\nMay 7th to 10th must easily rate as the worst week I 've\never had. Not only did the bank holiday put us one day behind schedule but things grew steadily worse, cul mini a ting in the self-destruction of the Comp Set late Wednesday\nnight. Many thanks to AM International for their speedy ser-vice. No thanks to Simon (when do I get a mention) Milner\nfor starting the rumours about Mel Kinki e and myself. We're\njust good friends. Cheers,\nJohn\nNEWS IN BRIEF\nMore Opposition To Quotas\nThe University of London's Joint Committee of Senate and\nthe Students Representative\nCouncil has come out against\nany quotas on overseas student\nnumbers. The Committee is\nopposed to any limits on\nacademic freedom and upholds\nthe university's right to decide\nadmission.\nIn 1981 students will be re presented on London Univers it y's Senate by the University\nOf London Union President and\nten student senators, six of\nwhom will be faculty represent-at ives. The Joint Committee\nhas agreed to increase the number of its own student members\nfrom five to six and these are\nto be elected as faculty re pre se natives as a \"dummy run\" for 1981. This procedure is subject to agreement by the UL U Students Representative\nCouncil. No Opposition To Massive Rent Rise\nAn expected 22 per cent rent rise in halls and student houses\nhas provoked no objections from Union Officers or ordinary\nstudents.\nAt last Tuesday's Union meeting President Mary Attenborough outlined the proposal which would increase Southside rents\nto \u00a314.00 per week from \u00a311.50.\nShe explained that the rise, which is greater than an inflation\nincrease, is necessary to start repayment of a \u00a3670,000 loan made\nto the Student Residence Account from College funds.\nThe loan is for the purchase of the 70 year lease on all the\nstudent houses in Evelyn Gardens as well as on three extra\nhouses to be available in about seven years. The present lease\nwas due to lapse next year and would otherwise have only been renewable for seven years. The interest rate on the loan is 10 per\ncent and it is to be repaid over 35 years.\nMary Attenborough's view is that College is acting to safeguard\nfuture student residence, a line which the Union has been urging\nfor a long time. Although the rent rise is large she is in favour of\nits acceptance, and believes that if this purchase goes ahead\nCollege will be favourably disposed to making more money avail able for accommodation should any further property in Evelyn Gardens come onto the market.\nThe rise is not as large as was first mooted. College's Finance Office earlier asked for a27 per cent rise based on maintaining\nResidence Account reserve funds at a level of 10 per cent of ex-p end it ure. The present rate reduces the reserves to about 7 per\ncent.\nMary Attenborough is waiting for further student reaction before\ninforming College of the Union's considered view. Good Response From Residents\nThe Rector has received about 30 letters so far from local residents who came to last week's\" Meet IC\" day saying how much\nthey enjoyed the afternoon. Captain Lindley who organised the\nevent is very pleased with the response. He hopes the College\ncan maintain the initiative and consolidate the contacts made with\nlocal residents. But College has not decided whether to organise\nsimilar events in future years.\nThe cost of \" Meet IC\" was about \u00a31,500, of which the largest\nsingle item was catering. The organisers tried to save money by\nproducing much of the material within College. The final total of guests was around 200, several of whom\narrived later in the afternoon. The figure of 130 quoted in last\nweek's FELIX was the number who had arrived in the first hour.\nHELP!\nHELP!\nGraduate student engaged in survey research facing\nrapidly approaching deadline!\nHelp urgently required to transfer replies from returned\nquestionnaires on to Data sheets.

Such happened on two nights\nlast week. At the Curzon in Hotel ridden\nMayfair and then at the Odeon Film centre, Bristol I saw Olm i's 'The Tree of\nWooden Clogs' and 'The Chant of\nJimmy Blacksmith' respectively.\nThe Curzon is Ultra smooth, but amidst\nthe perspex decor and soft lighting a negro\nstood upright dutifully taking our tickets.\nOlmi's masterpiece explores the arduous and\nspiritual life of peasant farmers, amidst rural\nnorthern Italy at the turn of the century.\nHere women are equal with men, animals are\nslaughtered for the next meal and the\nsuffering in life is rewarded by a 'place in\nheaven'. Yet it is also an age of the\nlandowner and change. This backdrop\nprovides Olm i with a rich texture of ideas,\nincidents and messages. A young child has to\nwalk each morning to school because the\npriest declares he is too bright to remain\nuneducated. Those who remain behind strive\nto have their tomatoes ready first for market,\nor to save the life of a bull by prayer. It is a study of a way of life now gone from Europe.\nTechnology has brought material wealth and\ndifferent life-styles. With this in mind how\neasy it is to realise the cause of so many of\nsociety's problems. The vandal at the bus\nstop is a symptom of a deeper trouble. Whilst\nman may enjoy his 5.3 litre car or his 125\nInter-City trains some have rebelled, unable\nto accept this destiny for man. The peasants\nin the film worked the land, followed the\nchanges in the season and looked to God for\nspiritual guidance. Today we press the digits\non our calculators for a living, follow the\nleague tables and look to the Costa Brava for\nrelief. Olm i clearly accepts that their lifestyles\nwere harsh, very harsh. But. 1 feel, like me he\nsenses something lost. Man has the\nopportunity for expression of belief and ideas\ntoday like never before. We have time to\ndevelop our minds, explore and understand\nour universe, etc. etc. yet we are in danger of\nlosing the aspects of our character and\nlifestyles once so precious and highly regarded\nMany hope we can hold on to them, and it\nwon't be easy. Our society, with all its index-linked wages and neon lights, will crumble.\nPerhaps we should not turn our backs on a society where people still hold personal\nbeliefs, live for the good of a small community\nand constantly improve themselves. This\ncannot happen by being shut up in high-rise\ncouncil flats in front of Anna Ford.\nJimmy Blacksmith is a half white, hall\naborigine youth caught amongst the\nminefield of a vicar who says he is not an\naborigine, and ran look forward to ali le well\naway from the likes of them, and the\nemployers; bigoted and prejudiced. Where\nhe seeks work he finds fear and resentment,\nwhere he seeks justice he finds none. As one of\nthe players says it only takes a second to kill,\nand how right that is, yet behind this\nmoment's action for Jimmy there has been\nconstant persecution throughout his life.\nFinally it is the efforts of white women to\ntake his white wife and child away from him\nthat produces the anatomical equivalent of\nthe elastic limit j pfa fc hacks 5 people to\ndeath.\nBRAM TCHAIKOVSKY: Strange man\nChanged man. (Radar)\nBram Tchaikovsky may be strange, and\nsince his days with the Motors he may even be\nchanged, but if this record is any indication,\nhe is also currently direction less. Despite\nhaving said that, this album is exactly what he\nthinks the band, also called 'Bram\nTchaikovsky' (for want of anything better?),\nshould be doing. Although it leaves him\nuncommitted, half-way between pop and\nsolid rock, it is an impressive debut album\nwhich demonstrates well the band's potential\nand promises much for the future.\nWell I 'll save my other moans for later, let's consider the music. 'Robber' is the first track\nand despite the tight sound of this exciting\ntrio, which also comprises Micky Broadbent\non guitars and Keith Boyce on drums, it's not\nvery adventurous; 'He's a robber, he'll steal\nyour heart away.' - no wonder there isn'ta word-sheet included in the package.\nThe opening lines of the title track possibly\nsum up the dilemma in which the group finds\nitself: 'Ladies and gents let me introduce\nmyself to you, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do...'.\nIt's a pretty good song though, but 'Lonely\ndancer' into which it runs is better. There are\nshades of the Beach Boys' 'Sloop John B' on\nthe intro to 'I'm the one that's leaving' but this\nsong of unrequited love degenerates. The\nfinal track on this side, however, is superb;\n'Girl of my dreams' the present single, with\nBram T. and Broadbent both on vocals, is the\nkind of music to put a smile on the sourest\nface. There's even Mike Oldfield on Tubular\nBells if you can find them.\nSide Two is definitely weaker, possibly\nbecause Bram T. himself has written all but\none of the tracks, the exception being a heads down version of 'lm a believer', and\n'nobody knows' are readily disposable;\ncallous I know, but they are. The only feature\nof note on 'Lady from the USA' is the bass\nguitar and backing vocals of Motors leader\nNick Garvey, dropping in to help his old mate,\nas he does on production - to its detriment. In\nfact, it is probably this unwillingness to\nseparate himself from his past that stifles\nBram Tchaikovsky, both man and group.\nFortunately, these are all quickly forgotten\nwhen 'Sarah smiles' and 'Turn on the light'\ncomplete the album. Both are excellent, one a commercial, bouncy pop tune, the other a jarring rocker. But here again the lack of\ndirection comes in; 'Sarah smiles' is overproduced - are they afraid of putting out a straight pop song (apparently not - it was\ntheir first single last July) and 'Turn on the\nlight' has all the sharp edges filed down, the\nband on a tight rein.\nStill, on the whole the songs are good, neat\nhooks abound and they might even be\ndance able. Do yourself a favour and get in on\nthe ground floor of what promises big things.\nJon Firth\nAt the triple-screened Odeon in Bristol this\nfilm certainly isn't getting the audience it\ndeserves. They were up and down like yo-yo s, and were as noisy a group of cinema-goers as I can remember. What was worse though was\nthat they were as bigot ted as the Australian\nposse in the film. It might seem an elitist view\nbut I reckon that the great majority did not\nallow themselves to question the meaning\nbehind the film. They were more interested\nin stuffing pop corn discussing the A A patrolman rape trial, ice cream and putting\ntheir hand as far as possible up their partner's skirt. Now there is nothing wrong in that you\ncry and indeed there isn't really. However,\nseeing films in London you are thankfully\nspared the excesses of a provincial or\nsuburban audience.\nIl'vo u have seen the film try swopping the\nlocation ofthe film from Australia at the turn\nof the century to Brick Lane today and you\nwill see how real the dangers are. The ticket\ncollector at the Curzon has a job today but\ntomorrow ... Then he might find himself the\nvictim of abuse, inequality and fear. The\ncrowd in Bristol would not go out oft heir way\nto help him. Hopefully we would.\nThere can never be any excuse for voile nee and murder. Yet when il happens should we\nnot attempt to understand the causes of it.\nand how they could be eliminated. Only\nwhen we have, can a decision be made as to\nwhether a more important priority is to\ndefend society with every punishment and\nweapon available.\nThere arc two sides (or more) to the\nproblems I have raised above. As diverse as\nthe cinemas where 1 saw the films.\nBoth deserve your attention and thought.\nRoger Stotesbury\nSMALL ADS FOR SALE\nRe' sonata acoustic guitar.

The University of London Accommodation Office is\nby far the best place to go to for this kind of book able accommodation\nand, if you want to use them, their procedure is set out below.\nApart from places where you live in the landladies house, there are not\nmany places that you can book in advance because most landlords are\nmore interested in keeping their places full rather than in having\nstudents as tenants and this means that you have to compete for\naccommodation with a great many people who are here all the year\nround and who are quite happy to take a place on during the Summer for\n- the rest of the Year.\nThe Summer period and the first term are not the best time for finding\naccommodation, because from June until September a lot of landlords\nlet to overseas visitors at grossly inflated rates and then from September\nonwards you are competing with thous nds of other students looking for\nexactly the same kind of accommodation. This means that if you can't find anything that you can book in advance, you have to be prepared for\nthe mad scramble at the beginning of term.\nThe best thing that you can do this term is to contact the University of\nLondon Accommodation Office and the Welfare Centre towards the end\nof this month and otherwise keep your ears open for news of anyone\ngiving up accommodation this term which might be available in the\nAutumn.\nULU Accommodation Office\nProcedure for Current Students\nSingle Students Rooms\nThose seeking single or double roo om s for September/October\nshould call at the Accommodation Office in late May/early June\nallowing themselves a few free days to look at the accommodation.\n(Flats for one person, ie room and kitchen or more, are included here,\nbut they are very difficult to find and expensive.) A retaining fee does not\nhave to be paid for this type of accommodation when it is booked in\nadvance. After the end of term priority is given to students who will be\nnew to London. Current students who have not found accommodation\nby then, however, can consult the notice board in the Accommodation\nOffice.\nFINDING SOMEWHERE TO\nLIVE FOR NEXT YEAR.\nIf you want some tips on finding\nsomewhere to live next year and if you\nwould like to find out how the UL U Accommodation Office, College Residence Office and Union Welfare\nCentre can help you, come along and hear\nall about it at:\n12:45 Monday 14th May\nin the SCR on the first\nfloor of the Union Bldg.\nHow About A Place To Live\nNext Year For \u00a33 per week?\nIf enough people are interested, there is a possibility\nthat we may be able to form an IC Housing Coop and\ntake on some short life properties which could be done-up and which would then provide very cheap\naccommodation for two years or so.\n'Short-life' properties are those which have been\nearmarked for demolition (so that the area can be\nredeveloped rather than because they are about to fall\ndown!). Cuts in public expenditure have meant delays in\nredevelopment and so the houses have been left empty in\nthe hope that one day there will be enough money to\ncarry out the redevelopment.\nSome of these houses have been left empty for some\ntime and they need quite a lot of work doing to them to\nmake them habitable. The idea is that those interested in\nliving there next year could do the work during the\nsummer vacation and pay back the cost of materials and\noutside help in the form of rent over the next two years. If\nyou are interested and feel that you could make a fairly\nheavy commit t ment to the scheme this summer, contact\nthe Welfare Centre on the third floor of the Union\nBuilding.\nSingle Students Flats\nAny accommodation larger than one room with cooking facilities is\nconsidered a flat. Only very few owners of such property will take a booking for the next session without charging full rent during the\nvacation. Unless the group is able to pay rent from late June/early July it\nis unlikely that a flat will be found before the end of term, but enquiries\ncan be made from late May onwards. Otherwise, the search should start\nabout four weeks before the rent can be paid and the earlier in\nSeptember this is the better. It is advisable to allow at least a few days to\nfind a flat; in September it is often possible to book temporary\naccommodation in the Halls of Residence whilst seeking a flat for the\nterm.\nMarried students\nCurrent students requiring accommodation for a couple or family are\nadvised to try and find it in July or August rather than leave it until\nSeptember. It is generally fruitless to start looking more than four weeks\nbefore the rent can first be paid. Addresses cannot be sent out of\nLondon and the mailing list service is generally suspended in late July.\nWARDENSHIPS OF MINING\nHOUSE, RAYLEIGH HOUSE AND\nSOUTHWELL HOUSE.\nApplications are invited for the Wardenships of the\nabove houses. The positions will become vacant\nfrom the end of August 1979.\nThe successful applicants will preferably be married postgraduates who have been at the College for about a year. The persons concerned should: a) Have some experience in, and enjoy, handling student affairs\nb)have the ability to take an active part in the administrative and social life of the house\nc) he likely to stay at IC for another two years\nA flat is provided for the Warden, rent free, and he/she\nwill receive an entertainments allowance. Applications forms are available from the Union Office,\nand the Residence Office, Room161,S her field Building, and applications close on Friday,25 th May,1979.
