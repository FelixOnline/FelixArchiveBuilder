If\nit\u2019s a publication propelled by the propagation of\nnews to its readers, then let me tell you you\u2019re in\nfor a treat because this is the newsiest, newspaper\nwe\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019m obviously referring to the\ntwelve page (centrefold included) sex survey\npullout. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say this is the\nbiggest ever sex survey analysis this paper has ever\nseen (I could check but I\u2019m not that good a journalist).\nWhat did you get last year? Four pages (probably,\nagain I could check but I won\u2019t)? Well this time you get\nmore than double that. And this is technically all news\nbecause it\u2019s the first time we\u2019re sharing any of this data\nwith anyone. You\u2019re all welcome.\nI\u2019m keeping it short and sweet. Partially because all\nmy editors are dead or dying under piles of books,\nnotes, stationery and candy-wrappers which means\nI\u2019m running around the office like a headless chicken\ntrying to make sure everything is ready. Mostly\nbecause there\u2019s only four more issues of felix left and\nI\u2019m already sooooo over it.\nI\u2019m kidding! I love it! I love you! : | So yeah I\u2019m\nout. Hopefully there won\u2019t be quite as many typos in\nthis edition. But obviously at this point nothing really\nmatters. Enjoy the sex. Or reading about it.

    "content": "Who\u2019s thinking what\nClitoris, female\nG-spot, vagina\nand boobs\nWho values the clitoris most?\n70% of international (non-EU)\nstudents thought that clitoral stimulation was important compared\nto 62% of home students and\n52% of EU students. But it seems\nthat Europeans may be the most\ngenerous lovers because an additional 36% of them thought that it\nwasn\u2019t sex if it didn\u2019t involve the\nclitoris, while only 12% of international students had\nthis opinion. Whether\nBrexit will affect the\nclitoral stimulation\nof millions of\nwomen in the\nUK remains to\nbe seen, but\nwe are willing\nto send our\ndata to the\nHome Office if\nthere\u2019s a chance\nit will make a dif-ference.\nWhat about the female\nG-spot? Turns out, more\nwomen than men think the female\nG-spot is a myth (13% compared\nto 8%). Worse still perhaps, 10%\nof men and 12% of women think\nit\u2019s the clitoris (nope) and 8% of\nmen and 2% of women think it\u2019s\nthe prostate (again, nope). Basically, you all need a diagram,\napart from those who identified\nas non-binary, of whom 54%\nsaid they knew exactly where it\nwas and how to find it. Only 28%\nof women and men on the other\nhand had the courage to make\nsuch a bold claim.\n\u201cI like \u2018em tight.\u201d Seriously, who\nsays that? Apparently 19% of\nmen but thankfully only 3% of\nwomen. No non-binary people\nshare the sentiment suggesting\nonce again they might be ahead\nof the curve. Still on the topic of\nvaginas, 80% of women think vaginas are all different, but 13%\nthink they\u2019re all the same.\nThe prostate\nand the penis\nMoving on to the main attractions\nof the male anatomy, 45% of\ngay men and women think that\nthe prostate is great, and 9% believe it needs to be stimulated for\nsex to be enjoyable Only 12%\nof heterosexuals have a similarly\npositive view of the prostate, with\nonly 1% admitting to a need for\nprostate stimulation.\nIn part that may be down to the\nfact that 9% of men and 18% of\nwomen didn\u2019t even know what\nthe prostate was. Mech Eng in\nparticular need some biology lessons \u2013 26% of them don\u2019t seem\nto know what the prostate is. Life\nsciences might need a curriculum\noverhaul too, though, because\n15% of them also don\u2019t have a\nclue.\nWhat about dicks? Do they vary?\nDo we really appreciate their\nsubtle differences? They way they\nall bend differently? Apparently not. 74% of men and 76% of\nwomen think that a dick is a dick\n\u2013 circumcised or uncircumcised.\nAlthough both men and women\nexpressed a preference for uncircumcised dick on average, women are slightly more likely to opt\nfor an uncut penis, with 10% of\nwomen liking them cut, and 13%\nof women liking them uncut. For\nmen, on the other hand, the preference for foreskin is 19% with\nvs. 7% without. It seems some\nmen are attached to their fore-skin. Literally.\nLooking at penis preference\nbased on fee status yields further\ninsight still. Although the vast majority of people really do just think\na dick is a dick, no matter which\nway you look at it, both home\nand EU students \u2013 if they have\na preference \u2013 prefer an uncircumcised penis, and international\nstudents overwhelmingly prefer\na circumcised penis, being more\nthan four times as likely to opt\nfor something that doesn\u2019t look\nlike a naked mole rat. For those\nLet\u2019s look at a departmental\nbreakdown: 29% of EEE students\nwho answered our survey say that\nthey like their vaginas tight, with\n24% of Materials students not far\nbehind, also finding a tight vagina high on their priority list. No\none in Chem Eng or the Centre\nfor Co-Curricular Studies (CCS)\nexpressed this preference for\nvaginas. You\u2019re also more likely\nto prefer a tight vagina if you\u2019re\nolder, with the peak percentage\nwith that preference found in 25\nand 26-year-olds. Thankfully no\none under 18 said they liked a\ntight vagina which means they\u2019re\neither still pure and innocent or we\u2019re moving\ntowards a society\nthat doesn\u2019t rate\nvaginas based\non tightness.\nA m o n g s t\nthose in re-lationships,\nthe ones\nwho are\nmost likely\nto prefer a\ntight vagina\nare the ones\nwith either one,\nor several friends\nwith benefits. Take\nthat as you will.\nEnough about vaginas. Let\u2019s talk\nabout breasts. Men are more likely than women to prefer big boobs\n(21% compared to 16%) but are\nalso less likely to think that small\nboobs make them sad (3% compared to 5%). Bioeng is the department with the highest number\nof Big Boob Enthusiasts (BBEs),\nwith 32% proudly declaring that\nbig boobs are great. You\u2019re most\nlikely to think big boobs are great\nif you masturbate multiple times a\nday. 45% of people who watch\nBig Tits porn think that big boobs\nare better. At the same time, 6%\nof people who enjoy Big Tits porn\nalso claim that they really don\u2019t\ncare much for boobs. WHO ARE\nTHESE PEOPLE?\nwho have a preference (at most\n43%, which is in EEE), the only\ndepartment where an unircum-cised penis isn\u2019t the top choice is\nin civil engineering, where 20%\nof people call a circumcised dick\ntheir preference.\nCiv Eng are our size queens, with\na third of them saying that penis\nsize matters, and that everyone\nprefers a well endowed partner.\nChemistry are quite the oppo-site, with the highest number of\nstudents (44%) believing that\nit\u2019s more about how you use it.\nStraight people think size matters\nmore than gay people: 18% of\nheterosexuals said that size mat-ters, compared to 14% of bisexuals and 17% of homosexuals.\nSadly for all you men, women\nactually care more about dick\nsize than men. 20% of women\nsay the bigger the better, where\nonly 16% of men and 14% of\nnon-binary people feel the same.\nWhether you think a big dick\nis important seems to vary with\nage. It gets more important when\nyou\u2019re in your early twenties, but\nit just isn\u2019t a priority when you\u2019re\n24-26. However as soon as you\nhit 27 you realise you\u2019re too old\nfor tiny dicks, and it gets back on\nthe top of your list.\nComparing those who think size\nmatters most with frequency of\nmasturbation shows us that if\nyou\u2019re masturbating less than\nonce a month or multiple times\na day, you\u2019re much more likely\nto think size matters. If you\u2019re\nhaving sex, you\u2019re most likely\nto think that size is important if\nyou\u2019re having sex 2-3 times a\nweek.\nFUN FACT\nAmongst gay students,\nthe most popular type\nof porn is college/frat,\nwith 55% enjoying this\ncategory. Only 30%\nof heterosexuals\nenjoy this\nFUN FACT\n10% of\nBioengineering\nstudents think prostate\nstimulation is gay\nThreesome\nBondage\nGroupSex\nDoublePenetration\nGangbang/Orgy/Group\nPublic\nMassage\nAmateur\nBisexual\nCollege/Frat\nMasturbation\nBlowjob\nB\ni\ng\nT\ni\nt\ns\nH\ne\nn\nt\na\ni\nBigDick\nO\nt\nh\ne\nr\nUniform\nSolo Squirt\nB\na\nr\ne\nb\na\nc\nk\nCreampie\nFisting\nPOV\nGloryhole\nHandjob\nMature\nMuscle\nVR\nPissing/Watersports\nGayForPay\nShemale\nBukakke Parody\nS\np\ny\nCam\nJock\nTwink\nWho\u2019s doing what\nSpanking the\nmonkey\nWe all do it and now we have the\ndata to prove it. We\u2019re obviously\ntalking about wanking.\nIt seems that with some minor ex-ceptions, masturbation is like a\nbalanced diet, or a good night\u2019s\nsleep; the more you age, the\nmore you appreciate it. People\nspank the monkey more and\nmore as they age. By the age of\n23 only 4% don\u2019t masturbate.\nThen BAM, the mid-twenties crisis\nhits, and the 24 and 25-year-olds\nof Imperial are less likely to\nmasturbate than their\n20+ equivalents.\nBut everything\nslips back to\nnormal soon.\nEvery single student\nasked over\nthe age\nof 25 admitted to\nflipping the\ndolphin.\nGold star to\nMech Eng and\nComputing stu-dents. They masturbate so religiously, not even\nbeing on campus can stop them.\n44% and 37% of Mech Eng and\nComputing students, respectively,\nhave admitted to masturbating\non campus. Bravo.\nThe porn of\nthings\nWhat do we leave behind when\nwe die? Our browsing history of\ncourse. And the most damning\nelement of that is our porn pref-erences. Thanks to us, you don\u2019t\nhave to wait till your bestie dies to\nfind out what they\u2019re into. You can\nuse the magical power of stats to\nmake an educated guess instead.\nSo, what do people watch?\nThe most popular categories of\nporn overall and the corresponding percentage of respondents\nwho enjoy them are threesome (45%), amateur\n(40%), blowjob\n(35%), bondage\n(34%) and\ncollege/frat\n(33%). However, the\nporn that\npeople are\nw a t c h i n g\nvaries a lot\naccording to\ntheir gender\nidentity \u2013 with\nthe exception\nof threesome\nporn which dominates people\u2019s choice\nregardless of gender. For\nmen, the next four most-popular\ngenres include amateur (47%),\nblowjob (42%), POV (40%), and\ncollege/frat porn (39%). Women on the other prefer bondage\n(44%), group sex (43%), double\npenetration (32%), and gang-bang/orgy/group porn (31%).\nInterestingly, while 47% of women believe that the porn they\nwatch does not represent their\nfantasies or what they expect\nfrom sex, only 29% of men feel\nthe same way about the porn\nthey are consuming.\nWomen have less varied tastes in\nporn than men. There were loads\nof popular categories for men,\nbut for women it seems that most\nof them are all watching the same\nporn.\nEverybody likes\nthreesomes\nbut...\nWe\u2019ve established that when it\ncomes to porn, it\u2019s all about the\nthreesome. Most people are jacking it to threesome porn, but how\nmuch is this reflective of their sex\nlives? Well, 11% of men have had\na threesome, compared to 10%\nof women, and 24% of non-bi-nary people. That said, only 5%\nof heterosexuals and 15% of bisexuals have, with 39% of homosexuals having had a threesome\nleading the way.\nFor group sex, the hetero/homo\ndivide is even more pronounced.\n2% of heterosexuals have been\ninvolved in an orgy, but 21% of\nhomosexuals have (and 7% of bi-sexuals). That means that if you\u2019re\ngay, you are ten times likelier to\nend up in orgy in comparison to\na straight Imperial student. #sor-rynotsorry\nDespite this, 53% of participants\nreally want to try having a three-some, and 26% of them want\nto give group sex a shot. Gender-wise, men are much keener\nthan women to try a threesome\n(59% of men vs. 48% of women),\nbut they also have a greater appetite for group sex (27% of men\nvs. 23% of women).\nIt would appear that the 43% of\nwomen who enjoy watching orgy\nporn, would rather have it stay a\nfantasy.\nThreesome-craving doesn\u2019t seem\nto depend much on sexuality.\n53% of heterosexuals would be\ndown for a threesome, compared\nto 56% of bisexuals, and 54%\nof homosexuals. That doesn\u2019t extend to group sex though. Only\n21% of heterosexuals would be\ninterested in giving it a go, but\n38% of bisexuals and 49% of\nhomosexuals have this fantasy in\nthe darkest reaches of their mind.\nFUN FACT\n2% of\nheterosexuals enjoy\ngay-for-pay porn\nvs. 27% of\nhomosexuals\nThreesome\nAmateur\nBlowjob\nPOV\nCollege/Frat\nPublic\nB\no\nn\nd\na\ng\ne\nGroupSex\nGangbang/Orgy/Group\nMasturbation\nCreampie\nBigTits\nMassage\nS\nq\nu\ni\nr\nt\nDoublePenetration\nBareback\nUniform\nSolo\nBisexual\nHandjob\nBigDick\nB\nu\nk\na\nk\nk\ne\nHentai Mature\nTwink\nO\nt\nh\ne\nr\nGloryhole\nMuscle\nJock\nCam\nFisting\nSpy\nVR\nParody\nPissing/Watersports\nG\na\ny\nF\no\nr\nP\na\ny\nShemale\nFemale\nporn\nfantasies\nMale\nporn\nfantasies\nFUN FACT\n18% of Civ Eng\nstudents need porn\nto function\nsex\nsexsex\nsex\nsex\nsex\nsex\nsex\nsex sex\nsex sex\nsex sex sex\nsex\nsex\nsex\nsex sex\nsex\nsex sex\nsex\nsex\nsex sex\nsex sex\nsex\nsex\nsex sex\nsex\nsex\nsex\nsex\n\n"

Your\nbutthole is an exit path rather\nthan an alternative shortcut. To be\nquite honest, I hate to discuss this\nconcept as mere mention of Adam\nand Steve makes me feel as though\nI\u2019m about to puke up my guts. I\nmean two wieners should be kept\nfive metres away from one another\nat all times. In fact I am currently\ndeveloping a penis repellent\nsystem involving magnets so that\nif any of the gays get too frisky\nthey will be unable to get through\nthe magnetic field. I don\u2019t really\nunderstand magnets or physics\nto be entirely honest with you\nbut hopefully this system will be\nfool-proof. If there are any known\nhomosexuals currently reading this\ncolumn I want to make an appeal\nto them to please just try to be\nnormal \u2013 how can you know that\nyou don\u2019t like diddling your fiddles\nin lady parts if you constantly\nspend your days putting them\nplaces where the sun don\u2019t shine?\nAll this chat about bumholes has\ntaken me back. I remember losing\nmy virginity \u2013 such a great coming\nof age moment it was. Of course\nI don\u2019t count that incident that\noccurred at camp with my cousin\nreally, as it was experimental more\nthan anything, and after several\nsessions at conversion therapy\nBrian is finally cured.\nWhen I lost my purity to the\ncarnal pleasures of this world\nit was a bleak and sullen day;\nit had been raining for weeks,\nbut the rain had let up. It was\naround Christmas and my then\ngirlfriend had come over for the\nfamily\u2019s annual party. After several\neggnogs we went upstairs and\nwell, one thing led to another,\nshe passed out, and then I ended\nup having sex with my aunt (no\nrelation). In many ways I think that\nday shaped me and informed my\nentire outlook upon the world. I\nalso developed a taste for oddly\nmasculine looking women with\nmaternal instincts but I think it\u2019s\nprobably for the best not to delve\ntoo deep into that.\nI\u2019m sure you all know that\nsexuality is something that should\nbe worn on your chest like large\nD-cup breasts, and it is something\nthat you should never be ashamed\nof. Except if you are queer,\nlesbian, interracial, an ethnic,\ninto watersports, or own leather\ntrousers. Also keep it in your fucking house. And keep your curtains\ndrawn. Thanks.\nN\now, I know I have\nspent many of\nthese columns over\nthe past year or\nso talking about\nmy proclivity for\n\u2018inappropriate\u2019 relations with\ncreatures of the animal persuasion,\nand although I hate to beat a\ndead horse (although that does\nsound pretty sexy), I may mention\nit again at some point. Perhaps.\nProbably. As you may be aware,\nsince no-one else in the felix team\nhad the opportunity to write\nanything this week, the issue is just\nabout as thin as my tolerance for\nmisgendering dogs and cats (those\nsexy gender-neutral cuties). So\nyou might have noticed that a lot\nof effort has gone into creating a\npull out section analysing the sex\nsurvey results, which is ironic since\nI know for a fact that the editor of\nthe paper never pulls out.\nI imagine like every year there\nwill be numerous reports of\nporking in different places around\ncampus, which is funny because\nI am always around handing out\nleaflets about identifying those\nwho do experiments on animals\nbut no-one seems to ask me if\nI want to join in. Luckily I carry\naround a hedgehog in my backpack just in case I get cold and\nlonely.\nOn a side-note, I recently started\ntrying this new thing to attract\nthe ladies where I spray myself\nwith horse piss (the jury\u2019s out on\nwhether\u2019s that\u2019s vegan). I\u2019m hoping\nthe natural musky pheromones will\nattract the females towards me on\na purely biological level. As of the\ntime of writing there are no interested parties but I\u2019m sure that will\nstart to change soon enough.\nSince I am currently experiencing\na period of transient abstinence\nand a remarkable deficiency of\nanimals, I have had to turn to synthetic ways of getting my almond\nnuts off.\nIn the days before I was turned\nby the great peachy light of\nveganism, I did have a... how do\nyou describe it.... masturbatory\naid, (also known as a flesh light)\nalthough it was made of planet\ndestroying plastics. In recent years,\nthanks to advances in modern\nscience, we have been able to\nupcycle materials to create these\naids and I have since started using\none again! It is amazing what you\ncan produce using just soya bean\nproteins and almond butter to get\ntingles all over your chi.\nAlso don\u2019t forget to register to\nvote in the next few days, and perhaps maybe, just maybe, we will\nfinally have a Prime Minister who\ndoesn\u2019t understand economics.\nAlso Theresa May looks like she\nneeds to masturbate. Jeez Louise.\nVeganism is changing\nthe way we eat but it\u2019s\nabout to change the\nway we have sex\nJonathan Masters\u2019 got pee\u2019d on\nby a horse to attract mates and\nset the tone of their column\nSex is natural,\nunless it\u2019s not in\nwhich case keep it\nin your pants please\nMonathan Jasters fondly talks\nabout the day he lost his virginity\n(and also rants against gays)\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nGay Conversion\nCamp\n\n"

    "content": "What is\ncheating even?\nLike, for real.\nTHE ULTIMATE QUESTION: did\nthey cheat on me (followed by\nthe lesser-known question: did\nI cheat on them?). Well here\u2019s\nwhat you guys think: most people agree that if anything physical happens, it\u2019s cheating. Short\nof that, you\u2019re largely OK. And\nif you\u2019re drunk? You\u2019re less likely\nto be judged as a cheat. Not by\nmuch though \u2013 you can\u2019t blame\neverything on your lack of inhi-bitions.\nSo how widespread is cheating\nat geek central? Surprisingly\nperhaps, only 19% of people\nhave cheated on a partner \u2013\nway below the national average\nof 41%.\nThese figures were pretty much\nconsistent regardless of gender\nor sexuality so if you could stop\nassuming bi people are more\nlikely to cheat that\u2019d be great,\nthanks. Interestingly enough,\nthose aged 26 and over were\nmuch more likely to have cheated on a partner, including a\nstaggering 80% of 27-year-olds.\nTo the 6% of you that queried\nwhether it\u2019s really cheating if no\none knows: yes. Yes it is.\nMost cheaters were found out\nat some point \u2013 largely because\nthey confessed. Women and bisexuals were the most likely to\nconfess (46% and 53%) whereas two-thirds of both non-binary\npeople and pansexuals would\nnever tell.\nWhen you look at each depart-ment, Civil Engineering and Materials students were the most\nsusceptible to guilt: 100% confessed to their partner. Chemical\nEngineering students were much\nmore likely to manage to keep\ntheir dirty little secret \u2013 100%\nwere prepared to take it to their\ngrave.\nIn most cases, cheating didn\u2019t\nend our respondents\u2019 relationships \u2013 at least not permanently.\nThis was largely because their\npartner didn\u2019t find out. Those\nmost likely to break up permanently were the unlucky few that\ngot caught in the act. Confessing\ndidn\u2019t seem to do anybody many\nfavours \u2013 49.23% lost their relationship as a result of admitting\ntheir transgression. So much for\nopen and direct communication.\nIf you want to be honest but still\nwant to keep your relationship,\nyour best bet is to let your partner find out either from somebody else (62.5%) or social media (57.14%).\nPleasingly, I guess, most people\nhave never been cheated on (at\nleast not knowingly).\nAmongst those unfortunate\nenough to have found out that\nthey had been the victim of\ncheating, 58% ended the relationship afterwards. A further\n11% initially ended the relationship but then decided to get back\ntogether later. Is this a result of\nlow esteem? You deserve better\nbabez.\nImperial students are evidently a\nvery forgiving bunch. Half of you\ndidn\u2019t break up with a cheating\npartner (though this may have\nbeen because you didn\u2019t realise\nyou were being cheated on). Of\nthose of you that did end your\nrelationship, 9% later got back\ntogether. Hopefully following a\nperiod of reform on the part of\nthe cheater.\nApparently, older generations\nstruggle with fidelity: 26+ year-olds were much more likely to\nhave been cheated on, with\n60% of 27-year-olds reporting\nthey\u2019d had a cheating partner at\nsome point.\nThen again, being cheated on\nmight just be a right of passage,\na statistical necessity. How long\ncan you go through life without\nbeing cheated on, really?\n30%\n7% 5%\n6%\n3% I have several friends with\nbenefits\nI\u2019m single and ready to\nmingle\nI\u2018m single and I\u2019d like to\nkeep it that way thank you\nvery much\nI\u2019m not committed. I only do\ncasual No Strings Attached\n(NSA)\nNo one found out\nand I\u2019m taking it to\nmy grave\nI fessed up\nSomeone told\nthem\nThey found out \u2013\ndamn social media\nGot caught\nin the act \u2013\nit was hella\nawks\n39%\n43%\n9% 4%\n5%\nWho\u2019s doing who\nYou\u2019re all\nrelationship\naddicts\nIT MIGHT BE THE PLEASURE, it\nmight be that deal the Union has\non Thursdays (you know, that\nBuy-One-Get-One-Half-Price-onall-12\u201d-pizzas deal) but it turns\nout Imperial student prefer to be\nin pairs.\nOf those surveyed, 66% are currently in some form of relationship\n(parasitic or symbiotic, we cannot\ntell). Of these, the majority are in\ncommitted monogamous relationships with mostly younger people\nopting for casual relationships.\nSo what does a monogamous couple do apart\nfrom being all lovey-dovey, ruining\never ybody\u2019s\nlunch? Well\na p p a r e n t -ly those\nwho get\nthemselves\npaired up\nwatch porn\na lot, more\nthan any other group (al-though single\npeople were a\nclose second).\nIf you\u2019re not in a monogamous\nrelationship prepare to hate all\nyour friends who are. People in\nthem report being much more\nlikely to be able to enact their\nsexual fantasies, think they\u2019re hot\n(or at least somewhere between\naverage and irresistible in terms\nof looks), and are happy or very\nhappy with their sex lives.\nOn the other side of the spectrum,\nof the 30% of single students,\nthe vast majority weren\u2019t happy\nabout it. If you want to change\nthat, your best bet for a hook-up\nis probably a Computing student\n\u2013 51% of them told us they were\nsingle and ready to mingle.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. 57% of\nmonogamous relationships and\n60% of polyamorous relationships were with other Imperial\nstudents. More than half of undergrads and Masters students\nwere in relationships with fellow\nstudents. We can only assume\npostgrads have had the luxury of\nseeing a world outside of South\nKen. Those with casual friends\nwith benefits overwhelmingly\nfound partners outside of Imperial. 37% of you would rather die\nthan date anyone from Imperial.\nIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019re not taking it per-sonally. Much.\nK. You\u2019re in a relationship. We\nget it. Your relationship is much\nlikelier to be super fresh\n(between one and six\nmonths) or long-term\n(something between\none and two years).\nIt looks like not\nthat many people\nmake it through\nthe uncanny valley of relationships and out to\nthe one-year anni-versary.\nWorse still, those who\ndo survive the one-year\nprobation period and who\nare officially in long-term relationships are much more likely\nto watch porn; 75% of people\nin one--to-two-year-long relationships claimed they needed porn\nto masturbate/function. Unsurprisingly, older respondents were\nthe most likely to have been in\nrelationships for more than two\nyears, though most of the youngest students had still been in a\nrelationship for at least a month.\n#afraidofdyingalone\nBut what about luuuuuuuuuuuv?\nThe vast majority of respondents\nreported being in love (particu-larly older respondents), with\nmost, falling in love some time after the three month mark of their\nrelationship.

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe counselling\nservice does\nnot work as\nadvertised\nAn anonymous student thinks that there\nneeds to be significant change to the\nservices that the college provides for\nsevere mental health problems\nE\nveryone gets\nstressed at uni at\nsome point. If you\ndon\u2019t, I applaud\nyour Jedi level\nof inner peace.\nBut for the rest of us mere\nmortals, it hits at some point.\nBecause it affects everyone, I\njust assumed that what I was\nfeeling was normal, that my\ncourse was always going to\nbe a tough one and it would\nhave its harder moments. For\nthe first year, that was true. I\nmanaged the steep learning\ncurve and new social setting\nwith a normal number of\nbumps in the road. But last\nsummer, and at the start of\nthe winter term, an onlooker\nwould have seen things take a\nturn for the worse. I, however,\ndidn\u2019t think anything of it for a\nlong time.\nI finally got a sense that\nthings were not normal when\nI was feeling so despairing\nthat I couldn\u2019t move or speak,\nand getting out of bed was\nharder than the current run\nup to exams. I wasn\u2019t learning\n\\\\ Until my experience can\nnever happen to another\nstudent again, we must\ncontinue to campaign for\nchange \\\\\nanything in my lecture courses\nbecause I felt like I had no\nfuture and that nothing I did\nwould amount to anything. I\nwas avoiding mirrors because\nmy self-image was so bad that\nbeing reminded of it would\nmake me want to harm myself.\nYou get the idea.\nWhen the alarm bells finally\nrang in my head, I contacted\nthe counselling service. It\ntook two weeks to arrange\nan initial visit. Once I got\nthere and alarm bells rang for\nthem as well, I was prioritised\ncounselling sessions. That took\nthree weeks to happen. So,\na month after reaching out\nin one of the most miserable\npoints in my life, I was greeted\nwith the question, \u201cWhat\nwould you like to do?\u201d I don\u2019t\nnormally articulate the details\nof what is running through\nmy head when I feel like\nshit, but I believe I need the\ndescription of the pit I was in\nto make it clear how much of\nan unhelpful question that is.\n\u201cWhat I would like to do is get\nbetter\u201d was what I thought,\nbut \u2018get better\u2019 doesn\u2019t really\nwork in the timescale of the\nseven appointments they offer.\nSomeone like me who saw no\nway out and no happiness in\nthe future doesn\u2019t know how\nto get better on their own. I\ndon\u2019t like making sweeping\nor perversely grandiose\nstatements, but the reality is\nthat there is a good chance\nthat in my position with maybe\na few less friends, and a\nslightly less supportive family,\nI may have killed myself if all\nthat was there to stop me was\nthe counselling service.\nIn retrospect, the support\nthey offered me would\nprobably have been good if\nI had more acute exam stress\nor just a relatively small bout\nof low mood. But someone\nwho can\u2019t get out of bed isn\u2019t\ngoing to drag themselves to\na stress workshop where they\ncan\u2019t share how they feel with\na professional, or go back and\nforth over emails for a month\nto try and see someone.\nDo I think my bad experience\nis the fault of the people who\nworkthere?No.Notatall.They\nare no doubt trying to offer\nthe best possible care they can\nto as many students as they\ncan. The time delay between\nmy first email and my first\nsession was due to the under-staffing of the service, which\nis no doubt oversubscribed\nbecause of the high-pressure\nenvironment at Imperial. My\nfrustration is, in a sense, not\ndirected at the counsellor that\nI saw, but at the college for\nclaiming to offer a service to\nhelp with severe mental health\nproblems, without employing\nthe correct staff to deal with it.\nThe service is not to help with\nclinical depression, but with\nshort term issues such as stress.\nThe purpose of the service\nhas been misrepresented,\nmeaning that people like\nme do not receive the help\nthey need. Those who need\nimmediate help are put on\nlong waiting lists so that by the\ntime their allotted appointment\narrives, the issue has already\nresolved. Moreover, there is\nnot nearly enough information\nabout other places to get help\nbesides counselling, such as\nyour GP.\nIf you find yourself agreeing\nwith anything I wrote at the\nstart of this piece, see a GP\nas soon as possible. If you\u2019re\nfeeling worse than normal but\nnot as bad as what I described,\nthe counselling service may\nwell be fine for you. But, in\nmy opinion, if you feel worse\nthan you ever thought you\ncould, I simply cannot bring\nmyself to recommend making\nthe counselling service in its\ncurrent form to be your first\npoint of call.\nI do want this to change.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this.\nThis year has seen many steps\nforward, including the creation\nof the Mental Health Officer,\nbut it is not enough. Every\nstudent should be involved\nwith improving mental health,\nas it will affect every one of us\nat some point in our time here.\nUntil my experience can never\nhappen to another student\nagain, we must continue to\ncampaign for change.\n\\\\ My frustration is\nat the college for\nclaiming to offer\na service to help\nwith something\nsevere mental health\nproblems, without\nemploying the\ncorrect staff to deal\nwith it \\\\\n\\\\ Because it affects\neveryone, I just\nassumed that what\nI was feeling was\nnormal \\\\\n\\\\ The purpose of\nthe service has been\nmisrepresented,\nmeaning that people\nlike me do not\nreceive the help they\nneed \\\\\n\\\\ Someone who\nsees no way out and\nno happiness in the\nfuture doesn\u2019t know\nhow to get better on\ntheir own \\\\\n\\\\ Someone who\ncan\u2019t get out of\nbed isn\u2019t going to\ndrag themselves to\na stress workshop\nwhere they can\u2019t\nshare what they\nare feeling with a\nprofessional \\\\\n\n"

Since comprehension\nof anthropogenic global\nwarming began, the fossil fuel\nindustry has been ignored in\nnegotiations and subsidised by\ngovernments. Much time and\nenergy has been spent over\nthe past decades to reduce\nconsumption of fossil fuels and\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\nboth on an individual as\nwell as on a collective level.\nHowever, whether the fix\nis energy-saving light bulbs\nor the Paris Agreement, our\nefforts are undermined by the\nrefusal to address fossil fuel\nsupply. A striking example of\nthis cognitive dissonance is the\nUK\u2019s commitment to an 80%\nreduction in emissions by 2050\nunder the Climate Change Act\n(2008);nowrenderedvirtually\nworthless by the Infrastructure\nAct (2015) which forces future\ngovernments to maximise UK\npetroleum recovery.\nThe fossil fuel industry\nspends millions on PR and\nCSR (corporate social\nresponsibility) to craft a\nwholesome and generous\npublic image. They also\ninvest large amounts in\nlobbying efforts, in order\nto exert political influence\nand ensure that extractivism\ncontinues unabated. Their\nprimary obligation is to\ntheir shareholders, requiring\n\u2018sustainable\u2019 growth and\nprofitability: a goal which\nrequires continual exploration.\n\\\\ Whether the fix\nis energy-saving\nlight bulbs or the\nParis Agreement,\nour efforts are\nundermined by the\nrefusal to address\nfossil fuel supply \\\\\nOnce fossil fuels are\nextracted, they are inevitably\ngoing to be burnt; if not in the\ncountry of production, then\nthey will be exported and\nburnt elsewhere. If we are to\nachieve climate justice, fossil\nfuels must be, quite simply,\nkept in the ground.\nThese companies, therefore,\nmust dramatically change\ntheir operations; if they won\u2019t,\nthen society must allow them\nto fail. Big Oil has gone to\nhuge lengths already to\ndefend business as usual, from\nsponsoring climate denying\npoliticians to supporting wars\nagainst civilians, suggesting\nthat they are unlikely to\nchange, and their failure is our\nonly hope.\nOutside of our corner\nof the world blinkered by\nconsumerism, direct resistance\nagainst Big Oil has been\nraging for decades. In some\nof these \u2018sacrifice zones\u2019, oil\ncompanies and the regimes\nthey support can literally get\naway with murder, as was the\ncase in the brutal treatment of\nthe Ogoni in the Niger Delta.\nIn this case Shell settled to\nthe tune of $15.5m, after a\nlong struggle by local people\nwhose home and livelihoods\nwere devastated by the\nindustry\u2019s actions.\nLocalism is a potent tool\nwhen resisting resource\nextraction \u2013 voices with strong\nties to place and landscape\nbring forward social justice\nas a cornerstone of the\nenvironmental movement.\nNo struggle reflects this more\nthan the powerful defiance\nof the Standing Rock Sioux\nat Oceti Sakowin protest\ncamp, recently broken\nup in a highly militarised\nexpulsion. Indigenous activists\nengaged in peaceful civil\ndisobedience for months in\nprotest to the Dakota Access\nPipeline, a project which\ndisregards their land treaty\nrights in an extension of the\noppression Native Americans\nhave long suffered.

However, women may use alternative methods\nof contraception such as the pill\n(31%), the coil (8%) or an implant (7%).\nHow do relationships affect safe\nsex practices? Single people are\n10% more likely to use condoms\nthan people in a monogamous\nrelationship, but best safe sex\npractitioners are polyamorous\npeople. While 11% of polys will\nnot use any protection, 56% will\nuse condoms and another 33%\nwill use the pill or a coil. No pol-ys seem to be relying on pulling\nout, or the rhythm method.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar, the rhythm\nmethod relies on carefully tracking fertile days to calculate when\nthe probability of pregnancy. Although the method can be up to\n99% effective, there are several\ndrawbacks which include long\nperiods of abstinence (up to 16\ndays), the chance of miscalcula-tion, and of course the lack of\nany protection against STIs.\nThe rhythm method is implemented by 3% of sexually active\nfemale students while 10% of\nwomen and 12% of men rely on\npulling out. This is an even less\neffective tactic, as there\u2019s often\nenough sperm in the precum to\nsuccessfully fertilise an egg. Not\nto mention the possibility of deception and the risk of getting\nan STI. Gurl \u2013 don\u2019t you trust\nnobody with your reproductive\nhealth.\nSpeaking of STIs, almost\nthree-quarters of all sexually active IC students have, at some\npoint, engaged in bareback sex\n(sex without a condom). Out of\nthese, 42% have never been to\nthe sexual health clinic. These visits to the clinic are more common\namongst women than men, with\n55% of sexually active men having never visited a sexual health\nclinic vs. 40% of women at Imperial. Women are also more likely\nthan men to visit the clinic regularly (at least once a year) as\nopposed to when they\u2019ve hooked\nup with a new partner or are worried about STI symptoms.\nYour relationship to sexual health\nmight be related to your cultural behaviours associated with\nyour sexuality. Straight students\nare less likely to visit the sexual\nhealth clinic than bisexual stu-dents. Further down the Kinsey\nscale, straight students are twice\nas likely to avoid visiting a sexual\nhealth clinic in comparison to gay\nstudents, and if we crumple up\nthe scale and throw it in the trash,\npansexuals are four times as likely to visit the sexual health clinic\nas their straight counterparts.\nAlong similar lines homosexual\nand pansexual students are much\nmore likely to regularly visit the\nclinic as part of their annual (or\nmore frequent) routine.\nSexual health\nchecks\nSexually\ntransmitted\ninfections\nThough most students seem to be\naware of the existence of most\ncommon STIs, 5% of respondents\nclaim to be unfamiliar with HIV,\nherpes and gonorrhoea, while\n10% are not aware of HPV, syphilis and chlamydia. Only one-in-three respondents were familiar\nwith shigella (which admittedly is\nniche \u2013 it causes dysentery).\nHIV and PReP\nPre Exposure Prophylaxis, or\nPrEP, has been in the news a lot\nover the years. Most recently it\nmade headlines when Scotland\nmade it available on the NHS.\nPrEP refers to an antiretroviral\nmedication \u2013 usually Truvada\n\u2013 which is taken preventatively\nto reduce the risk of HIV trans-mission, which studies suggest it\ndoes successfully by 80%.\nIn the UK (with the exception of\nScotland as of last month), Truvada is only free if it\u2019s part of\nemergency PEP. PEP (Post Exposure Prophylaxis) is given in case\nof potential transmission. This\nmight include accidental pricking\nwith an infected syringe (particu-larly common amongst health\nprofessionals) or a sexual encounter of high risk (particularly\ncommon amongst men seeking\nmen). Getting it pre-emptively as\npart of PrEP at the moment requires shelling out \u00a3400 a month.\nSo what\u2019s the relationship of Imperial students with PrEP? Of all\nrespondents, less than a quarter\nwere familiar with the drugs, with\n2% having heard of PEP and 3%\nhaving heard of PrEP. Women\nwere perhaps surprisingly more\nlikely to have heard of the two\ntreatments. Queer students however were the likeliest to know of\nPEP and PrEP and amongst them,\nstudents that were familiar with\none of the treatments were familiar with the other one too. 1.5%\nof respondents have taken PEP\nand 0.8% are currently on PrEP.\nThings you\nthought we\nmissed\n\u201cEveryone likes a spoon\u201d\n\u201cKnifeplay, orgasm denial,\ndomsub stuff (not bondage\nrelated, but I guess sort of\nroleplay?

A\nproduction by the\npuppet company\nWondering Hands uses a\nseries of witty sketches \u2013\ncomposed from verbatim\ntranscripts of real life\nexperiences \u2013 to explore\ndifferent aspects of sex.\nIt is directed by Edie\nEdmundson, who I interviewed last year for felix\nwhen she was the lead\npuppeteer in the Little Match\nGirl at The Globe. Edie hopes\nthe show will help address\nthe lack of proper sexual\neducation given by the UK\nschool system. She believes\npuppets help to make a subject that is often obscured by\nat the front were only a few\nmetres away the puppets\nand the puppeteers, which\nallowed a good deal of audience interaction.\nIn the opening sketch, Fuzz,\nwho looks a bit like a cross\nbetween a golden retriever\nand a pink Muppet, pesters\nthe front row to allow him\nto access 18+ material on\nhis tablet. When he is finally\ngranted access, he grunts and\nreclines, proceeding to enjoy\nthe material with help of an\naubergine.\nSome of the most effective\nparts are when the puppets\nacknowledge their puppet-eers; in one sketch, after\ndeclaring some bold sexual\nfantasy, they turn to question\ntheir operators, who become\ncomically shy and awkward.\nThrough methods like these\nthe puppets are allowed to\ngrow as characters away\nfrom their puppeteers,\nbecoming detached from the\nhumans on stage and taking\non rich personas of their own.\nThe show was funny, inform-ative, and, visually, a delight.\nMy favourite sketches were\ngiven by the puppets acting\nas STIs, including chlamydia,\ncrabs, and genital warts.\nSomeone at Wondering\nHands has serious creative\ntalent \u2013 these puppets were\nvery skilfully designed; I've\nnever seen crabs look so cute\nor genital warts so grumpy!\nI was also surprised at how\neffective the puppets were\nat giving medical advice,\nas a microbiologist, it was\nheartening to see accurate\ninformation being disseminated in such a fun way.\nReflecting on the whole\nperformance, it is clear that\nWondering Hands are doing\nsomething highly commenda-ble. Puppetry is an excellent\nmedium to discuss sexual\nissues. The way we associate\npuppets with childhood\nmeans that it catches us\nunawares to hear puppets\ndiscussing topics on adult\nthemes. We don't bring our\nguard up in the same way\nthat we might be inclined to\nwhen a serious looking professional gives us information\non the same topics.

It was, therefore, with\nconsiderable anticipation that\nI sat crammed in People's Theatre in Camden last Sunday,\nwhere the show would be on\nfor one night only as part of\nthe hotbed festival of sex.\nI am happy to report that\nit did not disappoint. The\nperformance was confident,\nwell-choreographed, and\ndelicately handled a range\nof issues, from first kisses, to\nsome rather unusual sexual\nkinks. Most importantly, it was\nalso really funny.\nThe venue perfectly suited\nthe tone of the show. It was\nintimate and relaxed. Those\nwhat is actually being said.\nEdie hopes that in the near\nfuture she might be able to\ntailor a more child-friendly\nversion of the show to be\nperformed in schools. She\ntells me that they have lots of\nsketches stored up, so it's just\na matter of choosing the best\nones to perform.\nThe run may be over in\nCamden but there's another\nopportunity coming up soon;\nthe next performance will be\nat Brainchild and Shambala\nFestival this summer, and\nthere are plans to tour the\nUK later this year.

One mechanical\nengineering student in their\nsecond year who would\nprefer to stay anonymous told\nfelix that many students \u201care\nfurious about the decision\u201d.\nThe student explains that the\nprofessor responsible for the\nleak released a mock exam\npaper onto moodle as a word\nfile which meant that students\ncould view the file\u2019s editing\nhistory. \u201cIt turns out, he simply\nedited the actual exam paper\nto make the mock paper.

I don\u2019t want to die a virgin. Help?\nBest,\nPew R\nDear Pew,\nDeep breaths. Breathe in, breathe out,\nbreathe in, breathe out. It\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll lose\nyour virginity probably. If you really want to.\nFirst off, let\u2019s tackle this incredulous rumour\naccording to which if you don\u2019t lose your\nvirginity by the age of 21 you\u2019ll keep it forever.\nIt\u2019s my understanding that the origin of this\nrumour is a stupid felix survey (this is all news\nto me)? If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned while\nwriting for this rag it\u2019s not to believe anything\nin it.\nPersonally as a semi-scientist I like seeing\nthings like p-values, standard errors and\ndeviations, exact sample sizes and all that.

I\u2019m sure that\nall you need to do is relax, be yourself (maybe\nlower your standards a bit/a lot) and just you\nknow, wait for the right moment.\nLosing your virginity is nothing special. It\u2019s\nmostly a bit awkward and lame. If you ask me\nthe virgins are the lucky ones; they\u2019ve never\nhad to know the awkward fumbling and compulsive crying that almost always go hand in\nhand with the loss of one\u2019s virginity.\nSo maybe just be happy with what you\u2019ve\ngot instead and don\u2019t be an ungrateful dick.\nAppreciate your purity, may it last forever.\nBig luv,\nChris xxxx\n\n"

These facts have\nprompted student protests,\nleading to one quarter of UK\nuniversities to pursue some\nform of divestment.\nAt present, Imperial has\n\u00a35.4 million directly invested\nin fossil fuel companies. This\ndoes not include further\nunspecified amounts that\nare indirectly invested via\nexternally managed funds.\nThis is claimed to be one of\nthe largest investments in fossil\nfuels by universities in the UK.\nThe Imperial mission\nstatement mentions a\ncommitment \u201cto address the\ndifficult challenges of today\nand the future.\u201d As part of\nthis, the Union believes that\nImperial should be at the\nforefront of tackling climate\nchange. Divestment is a\nchance for Imperial to support\nand promote sustainable\ntechnology. More importantly,\nthe fossil fuel industry has\n\u201cirreconcilable\u201d differences\nwith Imperial values. These\ndifferences include a \u201cdubious\nethical record\u201d, \u201cintellectual\ndishonesty\u201d, and a \u201cpersistent\ndisregardfortheenvironment.\u201d\nDivestment could be a way of\nforcing fossil fuel companies\nto change their behaviour. On\na more pragmatic note, failure\nto divest could leave Imperial\nwith stranded financial assets\ndue to rising carbon levels and\nan increased cost of burning\nfossil fuels.\nConcerns were raised at the\nmeeting about how divestment\nmight affect the relationship\nbetween Imperial and the\ncompanies in which it currently\ninvests, many of which provide\nour students with jobs and\nfunding for their research.\nFollowing what was described\nby Abigail de Bruin as \u201ca fair\namount of questioning\u201d, the\ngeneral consensus seemed to\nbe that the many universities\nthat have already successfully\ndivested have faced no\nobvious negative effects and\nthere\u2019s no reason why this\nshouldn\u2019t also be the case at\nImperial.\nThe Union proposes an\nimmediate freeze on further\nfossil fuel investment. To begin\nthe actual divestment process,\nthe Union sets out a five-year\ntarget to withdraw investments\nin the fossil fuel industry.\nFor those investments made\nindirectly via commingled\nfunds, it is believed that it\nshould be relatively easy to\ndiscover where money is being\npoured into fossil fuel firms and\nredirect it to other companies.\nAny future investments would\nbe subject to student and\nstaff consultation to ensure\ncompliance with Imperial\nvalues and mission statements.\nThe campaign would be\npublicised in the Union\nnewsletter, social media, and\na dedicated website.\nThe paper has so far been\npassed only in principle due to\nthe meeting not being quorate\n(following minor amendments,\nthe council will vote via email)\nbut there are reasons to be\noptimistic about the future\nof divestment at Imperial.\nUnion backing lends weight\nto any campaign. We have\nalready seen how pressure\nfrom students has achieved\ndivestment commitments\nat King\u2019s College London,\nOxford University, and the\nLondon School of Economics.\nIt remains to be seen whether\nthe same success will be\nrepeated at Imperial.\n\\\\ The fossil fuel\nindustry has\n\u201cirreconcilable\u201d\ndifferences with\nImperial values \\\\\nMigrant students gain financial aid\nJoanna Wormald\nA\nn interesting\npaper at\nthis week\u2019s\nUnion Council\nm e e t i n g\na d d r e s s e d\nthe issues faced by asylum-seekers and migrants trying\nto access higher education in\nLondon.\nTo study at a UK university,\nasylum-seekers and migrants\nwith Discretionary Leave\nto Remain (DLR) or Limited\nLeave to Remain (LLR) must\npay international tuition\nfees without the help of\nstudent finance, for which\nthey are ineligible. At one\nLondon-based organisation,\n500 young people have\nsought legal advice to help\nthem achieve their dreams\nof studying in a London\nuniversity.\nMany universities offer\nscholarships to help with\nthe rising cost of studying in\nLondon. UCL, KCL, and City\nUniversity offer a combined\ntotal of 11 scholarships\nspecifically directed at asylum-seekers and migrants with DLR\nor LLR status. Imperial offers\nno such aid. There isn\u2019t even a\nmention of asylum-seekers or\nmigrants in either the College\u2019s\nDiversity Policy or Access\nAgreement.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this\nway. Imperial can control\nwhat tuition fees it charges\nand what financial assistance\nit offers to specific groups of\napplicants. The paper cites\n\u201cexceptional\u201d students and\nstaff with DLR or LLR status as\nproof of the talent and value\nthat migrants contribute to the\nCollege. The paper claims that\nis therefore the \u201cduty\u201d of the\nCollege to embrace its identity\nas an \u201cinstitution taking pride\nin its diversity\u201d and remove\nthe financial barriers that\nprevent education being\nfairly accessible to all. Doing\nso would allow Imperial to\nbecome \u201ca true representative\nof equality and diversity in\nhigher education.\u201d\nDiscussion at the meeting\nfocussed on the risks of a\nstudent\u2019s refugee status being\nsuddenly rescinded, which\ncould lead to the student\nhaving to leave the country\nbefore the completion of their\ncourse. The worry was whether\nImperial should be effectively\n\u201cincentivising\u201d people to join\nthe College in the knowledge\nthat they may not have the\nchance to finish their degree.\nIt was agreed that this should\nbe considered on a case-by-case basis and should not get\nin the way of Imperial offering\nsimilar scholarships to those\nalready available or being\ndiscussed at other universities.\nIt was also noted that Imperial\nwas not being asked to provide\nhundreds of scholarships at\nshort notice but for an effort\nto be made to provide at least\none scholarship for those that\nneed it.\nThe Union has resolved to run\na campaign which would help\nasylum-seekers and migrants\nface the costs of studying at\nImperial. This would come\nin the form of financial aid\npackages offered to those\nsettledintheUK.Therearealso\nplans to lobby the College to\nreview the tuition fee status of\nasylum-seekers and migrants,\nawarding home status to\nanyone that would normally\nbe eligible (i.e. those that have\nbeen resident in the UK for at\nleast three years). The final\npledge aims to ensure that\nImperial formally contributes\nto existing initiatives that seek\nto improve access to higher\neducation for asylum-seekers\nand migrants.\nAswithotherpapersheardat\nthis meeting, an email vote will\nbe held, though it has already\nbeen passed in principle.\nWith a growing refugee crisis\nand net immigration levels of\n273,000 in the year ending\nSeptember 2016, these\nproposals could not come at a\nbetter time.\n\n"

They\nactually don't seem to be\nscoring too badly. The vast\nmajority have been deflow-ered (86%) while only 16%\nremain virgins. So most Imperial students have \u2013 at\nsome point \u2013 had sex. BUT\nWHEN? It turns out prime\ncherry-popping time is the\nripe-old age of 18, right as\nyou arrive at uni! Over 25%\nof all \u2018virgouts\u2019 (yes we\u2019ll be\nusing this term regularly) lost\ntheir virginity around that\nmark. Still, an intact virginity seems to be most prevalent amongst 19-year-old\nstudents (soz guys). In more\nmature age groups, losing\none\u2019s virginity becomes a\nrarer event (partially because everyone\u2019s already\nlost it already) with 21\nbeing somewhat of a\nc u t - o f f\npoint.\nW e\nd o n \u2019 t\nwant to\nfreak anyone\nout but if you\u2019re\na 21-year-old virgin and\nyou\u2019re dying to get some,\nyou may be running out of\ntime.\nTo make things even worse,\nImperial students who\u2019ve\nbeen here for a while are\nmore likely to have been\nlate bloomers. That might\nbe a result of youngsters losing their virginity earlier and\nearlier or maybe it just takes\na special someone to endure Imperial for prolonged\nperiods of time.\nDepartments were found\nto be on average between\n5% virgin (go Bioeng!

We tried to make\nthe process fun and hopefully we succeeded. Maybe. Whatever. The sex survey yielded a ridiculous\namount of data and insight into the sex lives, fantasies and minds of Imperial students. Trust me when\nI tell you we\u2019ll be having statistics nightmares for\nweeks.\nTrying to interpret all of the data has been interesting to say the least. We asked so many ques-tions, many of which we\u2019re willing to admit were\npretty dumb. Even the dumb questions have been\nquite something to look at, though. Sadly there\u2019s\nonly so much time, space and energy that we can\nexpend on the analysis. We\u2019ve picked some of\nthe highlights and answered some of the burning questions the student body has traditionally\nhad. You might notice the omission of some data\npoints. For example there are instances when we\ndon\u2019t touch upon specifics of asexuals, aroman-tics, or business school students. This is due to the\nrelatively low representation of these groups we\nhad at times that made us uncomfortable with\nreporting on and making generalisations about\nthe behaviour of minority groups (looking at you\nbusiness school students).\nBut, without further ado, here they are: the\n2017 felix sex survey results.
