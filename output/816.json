    "content": "Music\nAcid\nHouse\nA thousand vacant youths sporting\nten thousand smiley faces, except\ntheir own. Beckoning skyward as if\nto unseen hallucinogen e rated forms, in vain. The pulsing rhythm\nshepherding their minds around\nendlessly, it is bleat to the beat on\nthe modern British dancefloor.\nThe pro ported explosion of House\nand its derivatives is artificially\nelevated by bandwagon e ers hoping\nto hip-hop aboard the 'next big\nthing'. They create mystique around\nit and speak in hushed tones of the\nunderground movement. All to\ndisguise the obvious deficiency of\nthe music, it is dull. Turgid\nplagiarisms laye d flatly on a well\nestablished beat. A deja vu bassline\nand the odd inane phrase repeated\nad nausea m complete this, er,\nexciting and original musical\nart form. 'But it's great to dance to', is the\ndefence they offer. Those who are\nworried that Acid House may just\nbe as boring as they originally\nthought but are too afraid to admit\nit: after all, a hundred million\nlemmings can't be wrong. If it is fab\ndance music then fine, but why\npretend it is anything else? Why\nbuild the tower of youth culture on\nsomething far too flimsy to support\nit? Hype\u2014why not. Be paid\nridiculous amounts for the pleasure\nof seeing people part with money\nseveral times for the same product\nin vaguely different packaging. This\nmusic says nothing\u2014not to anyone\non this planet anyway.\nSo, time to put your mind\nbetween the lines, catapult yourself\ninto a different plane on the good\nship 'Ecstacy' so that you can really\nappreciate the subtleties of this fad.\nMaybe, the next time you're trip,\ntrip, tripping along, you'll hit reality\nwith a bump and realise that it is all\ncrap.\nLIVE\nRobert Cray\nHammersmith Odeon\nThe Blues is black music and its\nprinciple exponents, T Bone Walker,\nHowling Wolf and BB King being the\nmost famous have all been coloured.\nEric Clapton might have his own\ninterpretation of this music but\nlistening to the Robert Cray Band it\nis obvious that you need a dark skin\nto really play the Blues.\nRobert Cray is arguably doing for\nBlues music what Bob Marley did for\nReggae. Constant touring over the\npast fifteen years to considerable\nacclaim has alerted the industry to\nthe commercial prospects of Cray\nand a number of prestigious support\nslots for mega-stars such as Tina\nTurner and Eric Clapton have\nexposed the record buying public to\ntraditional Blues. Cray is the ideal\nfigurehead for this revival. He is\ndescribed as singing better than\nTerrence Trent D 'Arby, playing better\nthan Clapton and looking like a young Harry Belafonte.\nHis concert style is ideally suited\nto Hammersmith. The band was\ntight and supportive, allowing Crayhimself to be more free and he used\nthe relative intimacy to talk to his\naudience, even jesting good\nnatured ly with the hecklers; T don't have to answer to nobody tonight'.\nHis normal band was augmented\nby the Memphis Horns, sax and\ntrumpet and Tim Kaihatsu in rhythm\nguitar. Partially crippled by arthritis\nhe sat for most of the performance\nand appeared to add little until his\nown solo spots in which he really\nshowed his worth. There was little\nshowmanship, the music speaking\nfor itself as Cray effortlessly blended\nhis solos within each song,\nparticularly on the material from\nDon't be Afraid of the Dark which is\nhis most accomplished record yet.\nAs time progressed and the pearls\nof the back catalogue were played\nthe solos became red hot, especially\non Smoking Gun and Right Next\nDoor. Contrast was introduced by\nway of a slightly indulgent piano\nimprovisation by Peter Boe but the\nnight belonged to Robert Cray's slender fingers showing us the true\nsound of the Blues.\nC.D.I. Love& Money\nThe Senators\nULU\nHaving been fortunate enough to\nfind a seat in the upstairs gallery, I caught the last three songs of the\nsupport act, the Senators. I must\nconfess to being a little surprised\nthat a band with such a small billing\non the posters in fact turned out to\nbe a very solid, commer ic ally orientated band who I'm sure will\nprog ess to bigger and better things.\nAfter a short break, Love and\nMoney took to the stage, opening\npowerfully with old favourites such\nas Hallelujah Man. The set then:\nquiet e ned almost to tbe point of\nbeing boring if you weren't familiar\nwith the songs (except for the single\nCandybar Express) and was slightly\nspoilt by the lead singer's aspirations as an axe-wielding, hip-thrusting guitarist.\nJust as I was beginning to shuffle\nun com for ably in my seat, the band\nshot into what is, in my view, their\nbest single yet; River of People closely\nfollowed by Love and Money before\nleaving the stage only to return with\na brilliant rendition of Jumping jack\nFlash\nAll in all the set was good and in\nplaces brilliant although I wish they\nhad played some Hipsway songs in\nthe middle.\nRobyn\nHitchcock\nAssassins,\nJazz Butcher\nTown & Country Club\nAct I. Enter the world of the\nAssassins, A world of disturbing,\ninsidious music accompanied by\nuttering s of the grotesque, the odd\nmutilation or murder and love. The\nmusic is that from horror films when\nthey play flat fairground sounds to\ncreate a feeling of tainted normality.\nThe Assassins use d is chords and\nmis harmonies to produce effect.\nAlong with the visual terrorism of\nthe lead singer's eyes. This three-man group is minimalist but their\nstage presence and projection is\nmaximum. Their un class able sound\ndoes not appeal to everyone and\nnever will. See this excellent group\nwith an open mind. The stuff that\ncults are made of.\nAct II. A change of pace. The Jazz\nButcher are strange. They have all\nthe elements of a really good\nband\u2014original songs, fine lyrics,\ngood musicians and a character.\nHowever, they still manage to\ncombine these flavours to make a show of raw pastry.\nAct III. Robyn Hitchcock is simply\nhimself. He has no p retention s about being a rock star. He has been\nperforming for about ten years and\nis quite unique. He has no definite\nstyle except for the occasional\n'wie rd' song. Like Brenda's Iron\nSledge (which unfortunately he\ndidn't play tonight) and the\npsy cadel ic Man with a Lightbulb Head\n(which fortunately he did play). The\nthing about Robyn Hitchcock is that\nhe can play anything and make it\nsound right.\nHe was joined tonight by Pete\nBuck from REM for no wildly\napparent reason but it didn't matter\nwhy, he was just there with\nexcellent numbers like Heaven to\nfinish the set.\nCLASSICAL Maurizzio\nPollini\nRoyal Festival Hall\nThe Italian pianist Pollini gave this\nrecital as part of 'The Reluctant\nRevolutionary', a festival celebrating\nthe music of the German composer\nArnold Schoenberg. Fortunately the\nSchoenberg content of this concert\nwas limited to only three short\npieces. Described in the programme\nnotes as fascinating, these atonal\npoems had no melody or rhythm\nand could have been Pollini\nwarming up for all I knew.\nThis was preceded by pieces by\nBrahms, Schoenberg's mentor who\ntook the trouble to find out how to\nplay the piano before composing for\nit and followed by Beethoven's Hammerklavier sonata. Written\norg in ally for Archduke Rudolph of\nAustria, it gave Pollini a chance to\nshow his skill and dexterity, and his\npassionate rendition earned him a standing ovation. He responded by\ngiving two encores neither of which\nwere by Schoenberg, so that was\nalright.\nMaurizio Pollini plays a further\nconcert at the Royal Festival Hall on\nNovember 10 and is recommended\nto anyone who appreciates fine\npiano playing, even if it is\nSchoenberg.\nCDL.\nPage 10 FELIX November 18 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nCaterpillar\nCafe\nDear Bill,\nI am writing to voice my concern over the\nattitude of a certain sabbatical officer towards the\nstudents who work their asses off for FELIX.\nAfter I'd photographed a caterpillar found in a Snack Bar chilli on Thursday, Nigel Baker started\nthrowing around accusations of creative\njournalism. Then, on Friday afternoon, whilst in\nthe Union Office, I was accused, in front of\nseveral people, including two C CU Presidents,\nof faking the photograph with the sole aim of\ns lagging off the Snack Bar. I consider this to be\na very serious slur on my integrity as a photographer. I would like to point out here that\nI take photos to report facts and treat FELIX\nphotography with the same degree of\nprofessionalism as I do any other job, paid or\notherwise. To quote Nigel in his letter in FELIX\n(11 Nov) 'I hope that he has the strength of\ncharacter to admit that he was wrong and print\nan apology' perhaps through this column.\nYours,\nDoug King.\nPS. In the belief that a picture is worth a thousand words here is the 'fake' photo for you\nto judge for yourselves.\nDiplomacy\nDear Bill,\nWith regard to last week's editorial, perhaps\nI should elaborate on the item concerning the\nAlternative Prospectus. I feel that you have been\nunfair to the Mathematics Department in only\npresenting one side of the story and also in\nprinting a major inaccuracy.\nIt was certainly hinted by the Maths\nDepartment that their entry in the PA was\npenned by me\u2014they said as much in a letter\nwritten to Martyn Peck, the AP Editor. Through\nthe knowledge of my involvement with FELIX\nand the credit on the front cover, this was an\nobvious assumption to make\u2014it just so happened\nto be wrong.\nThe letter to Martyn Peck was discussed at the\nfollowing Publications Board meeting. This\nresulted in a letter from Sydney Harbour-Bridge,\nUnion President and Chris Martin, Pub Board\nChairman to the department pointing out their\nerror.\nA few days later, a third letter appeared. This\nwas from Dr Berkshire, Director of\nUndergraduate Studies, to myself, clearing me\nof writing the article and a polo gi sing for any\ntrouble caused. As far as I was concerned, this\nwas the end of the matter.\nThe inaccuracy in the editorial is in the\npenultimate paragraph. It is certainly not the case\nthat the department refused to let me re-sit some\nof my exams. They have agreed to let me repeat\nall of them. Any indication given otherwise is\nfalse and should be rectified.\nYours faithfully,\nPaul Shanley, Sherfield Building.\nLethal Letter\nDear William,\nI hope your readers realise that the be-cloaked\ncreature with the scythe is an imposter. I 've\nworked hard to get this job, and I'm not going\nto be upstaged by some mortal in a second-hand\nshroud. Poeple think grim-reaping is an easy job;\nit's not\u2014always on call, every second of every\nday of every millenium, spending much of your\nlife in squalor. I 've asked for help, but they just\nwon't listen. I'm chronically over-worked and I don't think the imposter realises this.\nBe seeing you all\u2014sooner or later.\nThe Grim Reaper.\nPS. Bill\u2014Him downstairs says you're overdue\non the payment for your election victory.\nSycophant\nDear Bill (and bod s), Thank you, thank you, thank you for making\nFELIX such jolly frolicking fun\u2014I can't tell you\nhow wonderful life is with this year's edition. The\nFELIX staff make me swoon when they appear\nfrom that cosy corner in Beit Quad. It is quite\namazing to think that those wonderful bodies can\nproduce an equally wonderful newspaper. I can\nbarely bare to be separated from my weekly\ncopy\u2014I flick through it in lectures and frolic k with\nit at night. It looks so tempting (like the Editor).\nPlease keep writing those raunchy, rivetting\nnews stories, those softly soporific travel pages,\nthose cleverly clueless reviews, those sub t ely senseless Union pages and last but in no way\nleast, those awesome and orgasmic opinion\npages. I do so love reading about Islam in the\nbath. Unfortunately I have now started taking\nshowers instead. What a pity.\nYou are all wonderful. The newspaper is\nwonderful. Life is wonderful.\nI love you Bill. I love you all.\nYours ecstatically,\nA student on cloud .'2 zillion'.\nName withheld for humanitarian reasons.\nNaughty\nNigel in\nSex Romp\nShocker\nDear Bill,\nThank you for the apology printed in last\nweek's FELIX (Issue 817). Unfortunately in the\nsame editorial you have made another factual\nerror. Under the heading UGMs you point out,\nquite rightly, that it is impossible to have sensible\ndebates when motions are only received at the\nmeeting. I am therefore thankful that you have\ndecided to print motions in the FELIX before the\nUGM. This should enable a more thoughtful\ndebate without people speaking for the sake of\nit or saying the first thing that comes into their\nhead.\nAlso under the heading, UGMs, in your\neditorial last week you go on to explain how the\nUnion Officers who submitted the 'New Election'\nmotion used the above situation to prohibit part-time students from standing. Anyone who was\nat the U GM will know that I proposed the motion\nand it was seconded by Ian Morris, the ICU Hon\nSec (Events), and so I must point out that again\nyou were wrong in your deductions. When I spoke to you, you explained that by wording my\nmotion such that all candidates must be 'Full\nMembers' of the Union I was changing the rules,\non who was eligible to stand, without informing\nthe meeting. However, what you didn't realise\nwas that the clause stating that candidates had\nto be full members of the Union was in the\noriginal by-laws and was not added by me at all.\nThe fact that the original by-laws were printed\nnext to the motion is totally irrelevant I suppose!\nI trust you will again print an apology.\nNigel D Baker,\nICU President.\nSorry.\nBags\nDear Bill,\nWhy is it that College Library carrier bags sold\nin the library at lOp each but are 12p each in the\nbookshop? This may seem a trivial point but is\nI believe the tip of the iceberg in terms of the\nbookshop's excessive pricing policy. Two further\nexamples are Ecology by Begon Harper and\nTownsend at \u00a318.75 in the College Bookshop but\nonly \u00a315.75 in Foyles, and A4 copy safe pockets\nare 35p each in the College Bookshop yet 4p each\nbought in bulk.\nWhy is it that student outlets in College such\nas the Bookshop and the student Snack Bar seem\nintent on 'ripping off students' when surely their\nduty is to provide a competitively priced service\nfor students?\nDave Thomas,\nApplied Biology 4.\nPage 2 FELIX November 18 1988\n\n"

    "content": "If you have ever been on a family\npicnic on a hot summer's day, or\nventured out into the sun in hotter\nclimates than our own, then the\nchances are that you will have been\nhounded by some of nature's most\nvociferous scavengers\u2014flies.\nHowever, it is now the opinion of\nforensic scientists that Mother\nNature's PR department has been a little too harsh on these insects, as\nthey can provide useful clues to\nsome of the most gruesome crimes.\nIn September 1945 a woman was\nwalking over a bridge crossing\nGardenholm Linn, a small stream\nthat runs just north of Moffat in\nDumfriedshire, Scotland. She\nlooked down into the ravine below\nand something caught her eye. It\nwas a human arm lying on the bank.\nIn the ensuing days the Police\ncollected over seventy pieces of\nbutchered human remains from the\nsite that was to become known as\n'The Devil's Beef Tub'.\nThis was the beginning of the\nfamous Ruxton case, a landmark in\nBritish legal history. A great deal of\nevidence was collected and some of\nthe most distinguished pathologists\nof the time were involved in solving\nthe crime. Amongst the evidence\nexamined were some maggots that\nhad been feeding in the decaying\nremains. The maggots were\nexamined at the University of\nEdinburgh, where their age was\naccurately determined. The larvae\nmust have developed from eggs laid\nby flies on the remains, thus their\nage gave some idea of the time\nelapsed since death, and provided\na strong clue as to when the murder\ntook place.\nThe remains were subsequently\nidentified as those of the wife and\nmaid of Dr Buck Ruxton of\nLancaster. Ruxton was found guilty\nand later hanged. This was the first\ntime that entomological evidence\nhad been successfully used in\nBritain.\nForensic entomology\nThe subject of forensic\nentomology was born in 1859 when\na Dr Bereget examined the decaying\ncorpse of a child, and on the basis\nof some fly pupa ria and certain\nspecies of mites accurately\ndetermined the year the child had\ndied. The subject was given a firm\nfooting when in 1894 P. Megnin\npublished his 'La Faune des\nCadavres Application de\nl 'Entomologie a la Medecine Legel'.\nThe central thesis of the book is that\nthe time of death can be accurately\ndetermined on the basis of the\nassemblage of insect species found\non the corpse. The idea being that\ndifferent species are attracted to the\ncorpse at different stages of\ndecomposition, and identifying the\nspecies will fix the time of death.\nIn practice this principal is not\neasy to apply. The decomposition of\na corpse is dependant on many\nexternal factors, the fauna hierarchy\ndepending on geographic location,\nseason, local vegetation, weather\nand so on. However, all is not lost,\nvery accurate determinations can be\nmade on the basis of the age of\nlarvae, although current knowledge\nof the effects of physical factors on\ntheir development is incomplete.\nIn general, as long as the\nenvironmental conditions allow\ninsect activity, blow flies are the first\ninsects to arrive at a corpse, usually\nabout a day after death. Obviously\nif the body has been concealed or\nburied in such a way as to prevent\nblow fie s from reaching it then the\nabsence of larvae can also provide\nan important clue. Blowflies can be\nof use to forensic scientists in other\nways; by analysing the mercury\ncontent of larvae in a corpse found\nin Finland scientists successfully\nlocated the place of death. When\nmaggots stop feeding they leave the\ncorpse to find a place to pupate,\noften migrating large distances to do\nso, in this way they can betray the\nexistence of a corpse!\nOne of the hardest tasks facing\nforensic entomologists is\ndetermining the time of death when\na corpse is several weeks old. In\nsuch cases the age of any larvae\nfound can be of little use, as it is\nunlikely that they represent the first\nwave of insect infestation. The soil\nfauna around the corpse undergoes\na change as the corpse decays. At\nfirst there is a rapid decline in the\nnumber, of individuals and species,\nreaching a minimum after about two\nmonths. After this the richness of\nfauna increases, but may be very\ndifferent to the original one.\nKnowledge of the seasonal it y of\ninsects can be very useful, for\nexample, if an exposed decaying\ncorpse is found during the summer,\nScience\nand lacks the expected fauna, it can\nbe said with some certainty that\ndeath occured during the winter\nmonths. The reason for this is that\ninsects are only attracted to a corpse\nin the early stages of decay and if the\ndeath had taken place during the\nwinter period, insect activity would\nhave been missed.\nOne important question\nsometimes faced by investigators is\nwhether a body, or parts of a body\nhave been moved. Here forensic\nentomology comes into its own, the\npresence of insects in their wrong\nhabitat strongly suggests\nmovement. There are cases on\nrecord in which bodies have been\ntransported great distances\u2014even\nacross the sea, but where\nentomological evidence has\ni eventually uncovered the facts.\nI Case study\nIt would be wrong to end an\narticle on death without one more\ncase study! A man was walking his\ndog in woods near Manchester\nwhen he tripped over something\nprotruding from the woodland\nundergrowth. On closer inspection\nhe noticed that the offending article\nwas a badly decomposed human\narm. Detailed exam in t ation of the\ncorpse and surrounding fauna\nshowed a significant reduction in\nthe number of brachiopods, putting\nan upper limit on the time of death.\nEntomology is a very powerful\ntool in criminal investigation, but\nbeing relatively new has not been\nexploited to the full. As in all\nanalytical sciences, a negative result\ncan be just as significant and small\nirregularities in the age or habitat of\nthe insects can mean the difference\nbetween a conviction or elimination\nof a suspect.\nSouthKenders\n+ <t \u00bbed bu WeY OF OooiA1\n.\nFIN Ki sci u^'rc j< H f\\T fn\u00a3 - fi W fc!I I'VE Go fT A GET OOIM&;\nSO FP-AT-tR.

On Friday we are\norganising a reception in the Science\nMuseum (all included in the\nentrance fee), which will provide an\nunprecedented opportunity for\nparticipants to meet the speakers\nand each other.\nNow, being a scientist does not\nnecessarily give you insight into the\nsolution to all these problems, but\nhere are ways in which you can\napply your technical expertise to the\nanalysis and solution of the\nproblems these technical and\npolitical developments present\nhumanity. Similarly, being a former\nUS Secretary of Defence or a key\nGorbachev advisor does not\nnecessarily, give you the monopoly\non wisdom, but it does make you\nworth listening to. That's what\nmany of the participants who have\nalready signed up think. We have\npeople from peace groups and from\nMinistries of Defence from both East\nand West, coming to listen, to talk,\nPeople from all shades\nof political opinion\nto provide their analyses of the\nproblem in posters and in\nargument. We have people\u2014policy\nmakers and their critics\u2014from all\nshades of political opinion. We have\nstudents and professors from many\ncountries; the talks will be largely\nnon-technical, but will demand\nconcentration from the audience. If\nyou're interested in finding out\nmore, contact me in the Blackett\nLaboratory.\nJohn Hassard.\nUS Peacekeeper ICBM\nEXHIBITIONS\nMuseum of the\nMoving Image\nSouth Bank Centre\nA classic movie\nOkay, I admit it isn'ta film, but it\nis as closely related as anything\ncould possibly be, and it's new, so\nwhy shouldn't it be reviewed here?\nNo reason whatsoever.\nWave your student ID, pay your\n\u00a32.50 and you can pass through the\nturnstiles into a world of diversity\nand development, wandering down\ncorridors which meander through\nexhibits showing all aspects of TV\nand cinema.\nThe museum is split into three\nmain areas, though they overlap to\nsome extent. Initially there is a section on early development, based\naround the pioneers of moving\nimages, Edison, Marey, Reynaud\nand the like. Since technology\nadvanced slowly in this era the\nexhibits begin to look repetitive, and\nalthough their history is recounted\nwell and in detail this is, quite\nfrankly, pretty but boring.\nHaving stumbled through the\nstory of magic lanterns and\nzoetrope s we come across the birth\nof Hollywood and the silent films\nwhich marked the dawn of cinema.\nHere we enter the second part of the\nmuseum. There is a change in style\n'as the individual displays now\nconcentrate on development in a particular field, sound or censorship\nfor example, or just a description of\nthat subject, make-up or set design.\nThis section describes the many\nfacets of cinema, past and present\nand even includes a proper\nauditorium where you can watch\nclassic movies.\nBeyond this we enter the third,\nmore familiar area of television. This\nfast advancing industry is shown in\nia range of technically oriented\nexhibits as well as the usual\nstoryboard displays. Join in; push\nbuttons, read the news, be\ninterviewed by Barry Norman.\nWhatever takes your fancy. Most\nimportantly you can discover where\nthe licence fee goes (down the drain\naccording to the museum).\nAnd before you know it you've\npassed another turnstile and into\nthe outside world, which begins\nwith a gift shop, of course. But look\nat your watch. A fleeting visit of\nonly three hours. Time to see\neverything, but not to overload your\nmind by seeing it all in detail. Was\nit worthwhile? It certainly was.\nWhere the museum excels is in\ncreating an impression of activity,\nwhile retaining the simplistic form\nof a passive museum. The\nopportunity to press or do is not\nabundant, but it is an inherent\nfeature of an exhibition like this to\ninclude moving pictures. Watching\ninnumerable clips from movies is\nmore active than reading a card\npinned to the wall, and as a result\nthere is an ever present feeling of\noccupation.\nAs with any museum many of the\nbest displays are tucked away in a corner like the computer graphics\nsimulation unobtrusively placed\namongst the many animation\nexhibits. My only other criticism is\nthe limited international\ninvolvement. There is little more on\nshow than British cinema and\nHollywood, and a touch of the\nRussian Revolution.\nSo, next time you want to avoid\nyour Sunday afternoon problem\nsheet or lab report, give the South\nKen museums a miss and wander\ndown to South Bank instead.\nAndrew Clarke.\nNovember 18 1988 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Travel\nnorthern areas of Syria and Iraq,\nwestern Iran and a small area of the\nUSSR. Estimates of their numbers\nvary according to which source you\ntake but sixteen million would not\nbe far wrong\u2014seven to eight million\nof whom live in Turkey. None of\ntheir host countries have any\nsympathy for the cause of the\nKurdish nationalism although all\nbut the USSR have at some time\nsupported one or other of the\nKurdish groups. Their cause is not\nhelped by their lack of unity\u2014there\nare six main Kurdish nationalist\ngroups (two each in Iran, Iraq and\nTurkey); they speak many different\ndialects, all mutually unintelligible\nand use three different scripts;\nLatin, Arabic and Cyrillic.\nHistorically the Kurds have always\nbeen nomads and as successive\ninvaders moved through the area\nthey simply moved further up the\nmountains to more remote areas.\nIt is tempting to only see one side\nof the story and regard them as a peaceful nomadic race who have\nbeen persecuted by bullying Turks.\nDuring the First World War\nhowever, in Van and the\nsurrounding regions over one and\na half million Armenians were\nslaughtered in cold blood,\npredominantly by Kurds. Since 1984\naround 600 people have been killed\nin skirmishes between the PKK\n(Kurdish Workers Party) and the\nTurkish armed forces. This,\nTurkey's unfriendly neighbours and\na right-wing government, have\nconspired to give Turkey the second\nlargest, army in NATO (after the\nUSA).\nYou may have guessed from the\npreceding paragraphs that my\ncompanion for tea was a member of\nthe PKK. Once he could trust me,\nhe regaled me with his experiences.\nHe had been in the prison in Diyar\nbak ir for four and a half years-Kurdish guerrillas have spent some\ntime in this infamous gaol. He\nclaimed to have been on four\nhunger strikes (the longest being 60\ndays) and to have seen five of his\nfriends die in this way. Another\nthree were killed by prison guards.\nMy credibility became a little\nstretched when he assured me that\nTurkey had 18 million kurds out of\na total of 40 million. When I attempted to probe more deeply, his\nEnglish suddenly became non-existent. After some time he asked\nme if I would like to see a Kurdish\nvillage only 40km away. I considered the facts for a few\nmoments. I was an easily\nidentifiable foreign tourist with no\npassport. It would have been illegal\nwithout prior authorisation from the\nWali (governor). The Turkish Army\nare reputed to have a 'shoot first,\nquestion later' attitude in the area.\nI didn't find the decision very hard.\nInstead he invited me to his shop\nfor 'Kurdish tea' and 'Kurdish\ntobacco'. I was very sceptical about\nhis adjectives as tea only grows on\nthe Black Sea coast in Turkey. As for\nthe tobacco I didn't know what to\nexpect as at one time there was a considerable drug smuggling trade\nthrough the local mountains from\nIran and Afghanistan. Both tea and\ntobacco proved to be the standard\nTurkish article although ground to\na fine dust and after an hour or so\nof leisurely banter I left clutching a pair of genuine Kurdish socks.\nAfter a delicious meal and far too\nmuch rak iI had little trouble\nsleeping. In the morning my\njourney back to Van was eased by\ntravelling with around 20 conscript\nsoldiers who were obviously very\nrelieved to be going home on leave.\nI picked up my passport in Van and\nheaded off west.\nAgrochemicals\nTo those graduating in 1989 or 1990\nin the Biological or related\nsciences\nICI Agrochemicals has a number of vacancies for those with the scientific skills\nand the potential to succeed in a world-class commercial environment.\n* On our Techno Commercial Programme, successful applicants will spend an\ninitial period in research and development prior to transferring into a commercial\ndepartment which will lead to an international business career.\n* On our UK Sales Training Programme, successful applicants will start their\nbusiness career in UK Agrochemical sales.\n' * On our Technical Programme, successful applicants will progress through\none of our technical career paths including, in some cases, career development\nthrough commercial positions.\nFor further details please contact your University Careers Advisory Sevice.\nThere will be a presentation for 1989\nand 1990 graduates, and any interested\npostgraduates, on Thursday 24th November, 1988 at the Forum Hotel,\n97 Cromwell Road, London SW7 at\n6.30pm.

Reinforced by three 2nd XI\nplayers the game started well with\nthe ball continuously in the\nopposition's half. The pressure\nremained fruitless, however, until\nDave Millard opened the scoring on\nthe stroke of half-time. IC piled on\nthe pressure in the second half\nleading to a second goal from Jon\nBriggs who managed to net the ball\ndespite being taken out by the\nkeeper. Five minutes later Dave\nMillard produced a carbon copy of\nhis first goal rounding off a good\nteam performance and UAU\nsuccess.\nFollowing on from Wednesday's game, the 3rd XI arrived in a good\nspirit eager to take the game to the\nopposition. Play soon became\nscrappy, however, as reckless play\nfrom the opposition marred the\natmosphere as IC took the lead\ntwice through Steven Burton only\nto see two sloppy equalise rs go past\nShaun West. Play improved to see\nSteve Burton complete another\nthrilling hat-trick and Kaleem\nopening his account with the 3rd XI.\nSKIING\nDry Slope\nRacing\nLast Saturday the Ski Club again\nentered three teams for the second\nmatch in the dry slope league. The\nfirst team had a relatively easy first\nround and won their group. The\nsecond team managed to beat the\nUCL first team (thanks to afa ller) but were then beaten in a thrilling\nfinish by someone running down\nthe slope carrying one ski! This led\nto a second round clash between the\nIC first and second teams, which\nwas surprisingly close but the result\nwas predictable. In the final playoffs\nthe first team were again beaten by\nHarlow, the team which is so far\nunbeaten. The second team faced\nUCL firsts again, but this time UCL\nstayed upright and won. Meanwhile\nthe third team won a race in each of\nthe first and second rounds but\ndespite this they came\ndisappointingly low in the placings\nThe final results were 2nd,6 th and\n13th. Thanks to everyone who\ncame, especially Tudor for driving\nTEE SPORTS PAGE\nThis photo was taken by Dug Queen\nFOOTBALL\nDivision 6\nIC VI\u20142\nLSE V3 In a game closely contested as the\nscore suggests, IC came twice from\nbehind to level the score before LSE\nwon the game with a lucky goal. Lee\nDavis scored with a remarkable\nheader, despite the attentions of two\n6ft defenders and despite Lee being\nthe shortest man on the pitch. Nigel\nSale scored the second with a20 yard drive from the edge of the box.\nFOOTBALL\nMatch Report\nIC II\u20143\nKent II\u20142\nAfter a string of good results, IC II\nfaced perhaps their toughest\nchallenge yet. The game started\nbadly for IC, but despite a lot of\nearly pressure IC managed to steal\nan early goal through Ash Jalan.\nKent struck back with two quick\ngoals and IC were looking fragile\u2014\nbut skipper Jezz Holland came to\nthe rescue with a well taken goal just\nbefore half-time to bring the scores\nlevel.\nThe second half kicked off and\nboth sides were going all out for the\nwin, despite many long balls and\nmuch frantic play, IC broke away\nand a foul tackle on Rakesh Muthoo\nresulted in an Ed Coates penalty\nand an IC lead.\nResolute defending in the final\nminutes gave IC the win and special\nmention should go to Russ Dark for\na particularly bad challenge and\nbooking and thanks also to Rakesh\nfor a broken leg (and crutches).\nFENCING\nFoiled\nSurrey\u20142\nKent\u20146\nKent\u201412\nMens\nIC-25\nIC\u201421\nSurrey\u201415\nLadies\nIC\u20145 Surrey\u20144\nIC 5 Kent 4\nA very good performance from all\nour teams with the sab roe urs beating Surrey 9-0 but losing to Kent\n6-3. The foi lists lost one fight all day\nand won 8-1 and 9-0 against Surrey\nand Kent respectively. This\nperformance was especially good\nsince the team is very different from\nlast year. In the e pee( our strongest\nweapon) we won 8-1 and 9-0\nThe ladies managed to win both\ntheir matches despite tough\nopposition with the outcome\nhinging on the last fight each time.\nBoth the men and ladies are through\nto the third round.\nGOLF\nFirst Win\nIC\u20143% points\nKent 2Va points\nOn Wednesday 9, IC Golf Team\nplayed its first match of this year's UAU Championship against Kent\nUniversity. Half the team was lost\nat the end of last year so a new team\nhad to be constructed around this\nyear's intake. We were somewhat\nunsure of the possible outcome, but\na good team spirit exists. Sound\nperformances from Alex Reilly,\nBoon Wee Kuah and Rhys Evans\npaved the way to a quite convincing\nwin,,if not evident by the final score.\nFOOTBALL\nUAU Thriller\nIC 1\n\u2014\n3\nKent 1-3\nA late surge by IC saw them\noverhaul a two goal deficit in the last\nfive minutes to salvage a vital draw,\nTim Sanchez-Fisher scoring in the\nlast minute of the match.\nIC, unbeaten so far this season\nstarted confidently, wasting several\nchances only to go a goal behind.\nBehind for the first time this season,\nIC rallied and top scorer Brian Wood\nrifled home the equalise r on the half\nhour.\nThe second half saw Kent out in\nbullish mood, dominating\nterritorial ly for long periods and\nsoon in a commanding two goal\nlead. With ten minutes to play all\nseemed lost, but a goal mouth\nscramble and a Guy Hattersley cross\nfor Sanchez-Fisher, saw IC saving\nthe match in the dying seconds,\nsending the fans wild.\nRUGBY\nDominant\nIC 1st XV-60\nKent University 1st \u20140\nIC went into this, their third UAU\nmatch, unbeaten and perhaps over\nconfident of victory in the initial\nstages. It was obvious to all the team\nthat if they were to progress further\nin the later stages, then this game\nshould be seen as an opportunity to\ndevelop the dominant, controlled\nrugby demonstration in earlier\ngames.\nThe first twenty minutes of the\ngame were generally scrappy and\nundistinguished, the only points\nworthy of note being two\nopportunist tries from Dave\nFleming, capital ising on a weak\nKent defence. Although the level of\nIC play picked up towards half-time,\nthings were not as easy as expected,\nand IC were disappointed with the\nscore of 16-0 at the turnaround.\nAn animated half-time pep talk by\nHenry produced immediate results.\nThe backs started to p aly as\neveryone knew they could, strong\nin the tackle and devastating in\nattack. The pack dominated in the\nloose and in the set, scrum s and\nline out s proving particularly fruitful.\nBoth forwards and backs showed\nsuperb handling skills as a torrent\nof tries de moral is ed the entire Kent\nteam. Dave Fleming completed his\nhat trick and Jez Quirk returned to\nhis devastating best, smashing\nthrough tackles to lay on tries for\nothers and score three himself.\nCaptain Jean-Francois Lucan bagged\na couple as IC ran riot.\nPage 12 FELIX November 18 1988\n\n"

I next\nwoke with the awful realisation that\nmyself and my baggage had to be\nat the bus station within ten\nminutes. Arriving at the coach office\nat 8amI was greeted by a plump\ngesticulating Turk who after some\ntime managed to convey to me that\nI should have been there at 7.30\u2014a fact I knew but wasn't prepared to\nadmit. He rushed me down the road\nand we caught up with the coach on\nits meandering s around the town.\nHalf an hour later, sitting on the\ncoach from Van to Kakkari in the far\nsouth-east of Turkey and reading\nthrough my guide book I stumbled\nacross an interesting sentence\u2014\"The\njourney to Kakkari is no longer\nprohibited, but you will need a passport to negotiate the army check\npoints'. A passport\u2014mine was\nsitting in the safe at Van's 'Hotel\nKent'. The thought of life in a Diybakir prison did not immediately\nappeal. The doctor sitting next to me\nassured me that I was in deep shit.\nTurkish and British coach travel\ncould not be more different. The\nbus-boy comes round at regular\nintervals to dispense free bottled\nwater and pour cheap cologne into\nyour cupped hands. Your\nneighbour takes great offence if you\ndecline to strike up a con ver station even if neither of you knows not one\nword of the other's language.\nTurkish women travel little and on\na coach of fifty, usually only one or\ntwo are female.\nI decided to be philosophical and\nsettle back to enjoy the scenery.\nAfter fifty kilometres or so we\npassed the Kurdish castle of Hosap.\nPerched on a massive sandstone\nbluff which rises sheer from the\nvalley floor it resembled something\nfrom a fairy tale. Hosap means\n'beautiful water' in Kurdish, a language which cannot be taught in\nTurkey. The Turkish translation\u2014\nGuzelso\u2014is used on the road signs. The road took us over a pass at\n2930m \u2014deb at ably the highest in\nTurkey\u2014where snow was still lying\non the north-facing slopes in July\nand we began a winding descent.\nAfter being waved through what my\nguide assured was the only army\ncheck-point on the road we made a stop in Baskale for refreshments. As\nusual the bus was besieged by\nearnest children aged about ten\nselling peeled salted cucumber. Pide\n(not unlike pizza), nuts, ayr an( salted yoghurt drink) and the\nwestern staples of Coke and\nMarlboro. Baskale is the highest\ntown in Turkey and I had little\ndoubt that it required some tenacity\nto live here in winter with\ntemperatures down to - \u00b0C. From Baskale we dropped down\ninto the valley of the Upper Zap,\nwhich joins the Tigris near Mosul in\nIraq. The famed greenness of the\narea was difficult to believe in July\nbut the ferocity of the river was in\nno dispute. It was hard to tell if the\nlarge concrete bridges which lay\nbroken in the torrent had been\nbombed by Kurdish militants or\ndestroyed in the spring floods. In\nany event most led nowhere.\nOccasionally the conical tents of\nnomads could be seen high up on\nthe mountain pastures. Their\ns craggy sheets provide most of their\nnecessities.\nTurkey has an admirable system\nof yellow signs to provide directions\nto tourist attractions but I was quite\nperplexed when one of these\ndisplayed the single word 'Iran'. On\nthe same road lies the town of\nYuksekova\u2014out of bounds to\ntourists and now temporary home\nto thousands of Iraqi Kurdish\nrefugees. Before the 1984 upsurge in\nthe guerrilla war, Yuksekova was\nthe base for groups of mountaineers\nclimbing the Cilo Dag range.\nClimbing in the area is now strictly\nprohibited. Under martial law\ntourists are restricted to the main\nroads and major towns. Travel in\nthe Hakkari province is now less\npopular with western tourists than\ncholera.\nSome kilometres after the Iran\nturn off we bagan to climb up a minor road out of the valley. We\nwere now less than 3km from\nKakkari and I began to relax. I should have had more faith in\nTurkish law enforcement. Within\nsight of the small town strung out\nalong the winding main street we\nstopped at police checkpoint. I avoided any eye contact with the\nburly police officers checking papers\nat the other end of the bus and tried\nnot to think of the two edgy young\nconscripts toting their sub-machine\nguns outside. I sunk back into my\nseat and fervently discussed the\nbeauty of Turkey with my\nneighbour. All to no avail. I was\nsitting in the little hut at the side of\nthe road two minutes later, one of\nthe conscripts having dragged my\nrucksack upside down off the bus\nthe other watching me carefully for\nsuspicious movements. Just as the\ncoach began to move off the officer, _\nin charge had a change of heart and'\nI lumbered off up the road weighed\ndown with my rucksack.

    "content": "R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNUS protest over loans\nOn Wednesday the National Union\nof Students (NUS) organised an at in al day of action to protest\nagainst the Government's proposed\nstudent loans. In London the action\nincluded a picket outside the\nDepartment of Education and\nScience that led to several arrests\nand pickets of all the major NUS\nLondon colleges. This was due to\ninclude the total occupation of the\nLondon School of Economics by\nstudents\nThe culmination of the London\nNUS action was a mass\ndemonstration organised against\ncentral London branches of the\nmajor banks who will be financing\nloans. Some 500 students queued\nup en-mass, disrupting the flow of\nnormal business, to hand in\nprepared letters. The letters,\nproduced by the NUS, outlined the\nmajor effects that the introduction\nof Joans would have on students\nand urged the banks not to do the\nGovernment's 'dirty work' for.\nthem.\nThe NUS estimate that the\nintroduction of loans coupled with\nthe freezing of grants and the loss\nof benefits, including Housing\nBenefit and Income Support, will\nmean that the average student will\nbe \u00a3500 worse off each year. This\nyear's first years are expected to be\nfacing loans of about \u00a3300 in their\nfinal year.\nThe action comes in the wake of\nseveral motions to the University of\nLondon Union at the last General\nUnion Council (GUC). The motions\ncalled for days of action over the\nGovernment's proposals on student\nloans, and its survey on affiliation\nto the NUS.\nStaff member 'squatting' in student flat\nAn administrative mistake has\nallowed a member of the College's research staff to remain unnoticed\nin student accommodation for three\nyears. As a sitting tenant,\nBiotechnology Research Assistant,\nCarlos Flores is now refusing to\nvacate his College Head Tenancy\nRat in Gerrard Mansions, after\ntaking legal advice.\nMr Flores signed a one year\ncontract for the flat in 1986. He\nclaims that, after his contract\nexpired, he remained in residence\nwhilst the College continued to bill\nhim for rent. This, Mr Hores claims,\nconstituted an extension of the\ntenancy agreement, allowing him to\nclaim sitting tenant rights when the\nCollege asked him to leave earlier\nthis year.\nCollege Accommodation Officer\nLoretto O 'Callaghan told FELIX that\nshe 'smelt a rat' when she started\nher job last year, and wrote to Mr\nFlores requesting him to leave his\nflat. She claimed it was ridiculous\nfor Mr Flores to claim that her\nrequest was illegal and added 'He's behaving very badly.' Ms\nO 'Calllaghan admits that the\nCollege would now require a court\norder to evict Mr Flores, who she\ndescribes as 'a squatter.' The court\ncosts would not, however be\nfinancially viable. Senior Assistant\nFinance Officer, Malcolm Aldridge,\ntold FELIX that such a court case,\nwould only be a 'Pyrrhic victory.'\nThe Head Tenancy flats in\nGerrard St, Soho are unfurnished\nand require students to supply floor\ncoverings, and furniture. Mr Flores\nclaims that he has decorated and\nfurnished his flat and feels that one\nyear contracts in such properties are\nunfair. Ms O 'Callaghan countered\nthat one year contracts are used to\nprevent tenants gaining sitting\ntenants' rights.\nThe College now intends to\ncontinue billing Mr Flores with a 'Mesne rent. Such a rent is set for\nbills alone and does not recognise\nthe payer as having any legal rights\nof tenancy. Ms O 'Callaghan\nsummed up by saying 'He's not\nwanted here because he's squatting.'\nISSUE816 Chemistry\nExplosion\n'blown-up'\nA Chemistry student was injured on\nWednesday when a glass flask\nexploded in his face. Fellow\nstudents contacted the emergency\nservices, who, in a move described\nand 'wisely cautious' by College\nSecurity Chief Geoff Reeves, called\nthe police, ambulance service and\nseveral fire engines. The student,\nwho was fully conscious\nthroughout, was reported as being\n'embarrassed' by the incident.\n4 NOV1988 "

Being in\nopposition, both IC teams explained\nthe dreads of London apart from\nother things. Our teams were\ncomprised of; Mark Gialanze and\nDave Roberts for one team and\nLynder Matthews and Paul Bayton\nfor the other.\nThe debating was both vigorous,\ndynamic and exciting, yet also very\ncourteous, and rules of the house in\ngeneral observed.\nBoth IC teams did exceedingly\nwell, especially considering some of\nthe members had no debating\nexperience like this before, and they\nraised several points of information\nand made powerful speeches in\nopposition to the motion. IC faced\nstiff competition from much more\nexperienced Oxford, LSE and\nBrunei teams, most of which were\ncomposed of students of the arf s, many of which were law students\nwhose very job it is to debate, and\nwith debating societies over twenty\ntimes bigger than IC's. Both\nImperial teams were thus knocked\nout after the first round.\nIn the evening the unprepared\nintermediary and prepared final\nround was held, where the debating\nwas even fiercer, and very\nentertaining. The m orions were 'this\nhouse believes that a green world is\ndetrimental to the comfort of man'\nand 'this house believes that a terrorist's life is as important as a soldier's. The team from LSE won.\nDabating can be great fun, and if\nyou want to take part in debates\nsuch as this one (there's two debates\ncoming up), or would like to partake\nin more informal debates, or would\nsimply like to listen, then why not\njoin Debsoc.

It claims that 'the subjects\nwill emerge stronger from\nconcentrating staff and students into\nfewer universities'.\nThe report's objective is not to\nincrease already large departments\nsuch as those at IC but to 'maximise\nthe number of viable departments'.\nThe UGC report gives affected\nuniversities three choices. The first\nis to build up their departments,\nsomething RHBNC is financially\nincapable of doing. Alternatively,\nthey can merge departments within\ntheir universities, with two\ndepartments receiving the funding\nequivalent of one. The final choice\nis to 'enter into a consortium with\nneighbouring universities'.\nProfessors in the Chemistry\nDepartments at RHBNC view the\nlast option with most optimism.\nIn an interview with the 'Herald\nand News' RHBNC College\nSecretary, John Laureys, said that\nhe was not expecting to have to\nclose the Physics and Chemistry\nDepartments but pointed out that a merger with Imperial College was\nbeing investigated.\nBikes\nnapped\nIC Students' bicycles were removed\nfrom outside the Physics\ndepartment by Scotland Yard at the\nweekend as a precaution against\nterrorist activity over Sunday's Rememberance Ceremony in the\nAlbert Hall.\nLocks provided by the College's security department were removed\nwith a pneumatic drill in the move\nmade after a bike with its frame\nstuffed with explosives blew up\nseveral years ago.\nThe bicycles have now been\nreturned to their owners with the\npolice force paying for the\nreplacement of locks.\nCareers\ndemo\nImperial College's Third World First\nand Campaign Against the Arms\nTrade groups staged a demonstration, outside the careers\nfair this week, against companies\nrecruiting for defense work.\nThey cite eight companies as\n'major arms traders' which include\navionics and aerospace companies\nas the Ministry of Defence.\n'Students are unaware of the\nextent of the arms trade with the\nThird World', claimed a spokesman.\nAnd finally...\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, was\ndetained at Indian customs on his\ntour of the Far East recently when\nhe was unable to produce an entry\nvisa at Delhi.

They were pointing\nat an object in their chilli not dissimilar to a rat turd (not one of mine!)\nand asking if it was part of the staple IC diet. Close inspection with a400 mm camera revealed that the turd was in fact a caterpillar, a photograph of which\ncan be seen displayed on Union President Nigel Baker's door.

    "content": "Feature\nRussia's potential SDI launcher.\nour OF\nTHE\nA fV tS PACE\nIn early December, thirty-seven\nscientists will be descending on\nImperial College to speak in a conference which will address some\nof the most pressing issues we face\nas a species including how to get out\nof the arms race and avoid the\notherwise unavoidable\nThe arms race is\ndraining humanity of\nenormous resources\nconsequences. They range from\nRoald Sagdeev, President\nGorbachev's key policy and science\nadvisor, to Robert McNamara,\nPresidents Kennedy and Johnson's Secretary of Defence, and architect\nof the philosophy which has\nunderlain global security since those\ndays, Mutally Assured Destruction.\nThey' ll be coming from East\nGermany (talking about chemical\nweapons, civil infrastructures in\nwar) and from Argentina (The arms\nrace in the developing world). Some\nbelieve nuclear weapons testing and\nproliferation are necessary and\nunavoidable and others that they are\nunnecessary and avoidable. They've\nmade key contributions to the\ndevelopment of new weapons\n( Gar win, Taylor) arid key contributions to preventing their\nmisuse (Garwin, Taylor). It's going\nto be feisty, contentious, informative\nand, above all, given the calibre of\nour speakers, interesting.\n'Today, the arms race is draining\n< humanity of enormous resources:\nmaterial, moral and intellectual.\n\\ i Unfortunately, science and scientists\n| \\have contributed to this dangerous state\nI! of affairs. As scientists, as citizens of the\nworld, we have the duty both to\nrecognise this and to use our skills to\nexplore ways out of the present\nsituation.'\nThus concluded a meeting of 3000\nscientists at the First International\nScientists' Congress, entitled 'Ways\nOut of the Arms Race', held in\nHamburg in 1986. Since that date,\nour group of scientists from East and\nWest Germany, France, Italy, the\nSoviet Union, UK and USA have\nbeen working to provide a forum for\nthe presentation of ideas which\nexplore ways out of the present\nsituation, and a critical analysis of\ncurrent trends in the arms race. The\nSecond Congress here at Imperial\nCollege will provide that forum.\nWhat is the present situation? Is\nit so dire? And why and how should\nscientists contribute to finding ways\nout?\nWe live in interesting times. Great\nchanges in the structure of the\nglobal balance of power are taking\nplace. The massive transfer of\neconomic might from the USA to\nthe Pacific basin has been coincident\nwith a massive post-way American\narmaments build up. The gradual\nfracturing of Soviet spheres of\ninfluence have coincided with their\nequally massive arms build up, and\nthe recent extraordinary changes in\ntheir society's fabric. Under Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan,\nwe have seen the world's first\nnuclear force reduction treaty-doing away with a whole and very\ndangerous class of weapons\u2014while\nevery day we read of new nuclear\ndeployments, at sea, in space, and\nin supposedly non-nuclear\ncountries. A further dimension is\nadded by the alleged, denied,\nproven and continued use of\nchemical weapons in the Middle\nEast, the planned production of\nbinary artillery shells by the USA, and the undoubted Soviet block\ncapabilities in this field. New technologies have profound i mph cations to nuclear proliferation,\nmini at uris ation, delivery systems\nand testing, the verification of arms\ncontrol treaties, the ability to wreak\n'first-strike' devastation on an\nenemy, anti-satellite weapons,\nsubmarine detection and concealment, and the command and\ncontrol of nuclear war. The last ten\nyears have seen a technology-led\nrevolution in each field. Our Congress will, uniquely, give an up-to-date assessment of the State of\nthe Arms Race, and more\nimportantly, suggest definite ways\nto end it. Scientists have an\nimportant role in this endeavour.\nTake, for example, last week's news that the Soviets have agreed\nto convert the contentious\nNew technologies\nhave profound\nimplications to nuclear\nproliferation\nKrasnoyarsk phased-array radar to\ncivilian use. This is a smart move,\nsince it may well have violated the\nanti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty,\nand has led to many Western\nfactions giving support to the\nStrategic Defence Initiative, (SDI).\nThis initiative\u2014meant originally to\ndefend cities\u2014is discredited among\nmost US Administration experts\nand defence analysts as being\nunworkable. However, a weapon\nhopelessly ineffective against\nballistic missiles could be very\nefficient in knocking out satellites\nwhich could be disastrously\ndes tabi lising in its effect on verification and early warning\nsystems; making the likelihood of\ndisaster much greater. What's more,\nscaled-down SDI plans threaten that\ncornerstone of non-proliferation in\nspace, the A BM treaty.\nNow, the assessment of\nKrasnoyarsk relies on a working\nknowledge of its capabilities. The\nasses ment of Soviet sincerity in its\nconversion will rely on a working\nknowledge of the Soviet Academy\nof Sciences' intentions and the\nmeans to ensure they're carried out.\nWe're delighted, therefore, that we\nhave three heads and one former\nhead of department of the Soviet\nAcademy of Sciences to tell us about\ntheir plans. The implications of the\nlatest Soviet move deserve very\ncareful assessment, especially in the\nlight of their own research in SDI\nrelated technologies.\nAnother area where scientists\nshould contribute is in the very\ncontentious issue of whether there\nis the need to test nuclear weapons.\nScientists have an\nimportant role in this\nendeavour\nThe current of opinion now seems\nto be saying that, besides being\nescalator y and damaging to our\nalready creaking environment,\nnuclear tests of weapons are\ntechnically unnecessary. The debate\ncontinues, and underlies the\nfundamental issue of the\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If\nthis were signed and ratified, could\nwe ever know if the Soviets or the\nAmericans were cheating by just\ntesting small, seismically decoupled\nwarheads? The answer is probably\n'Yes', but obviously deserves careful\nthought.\nThe Congress will take place on\nFriday evening (2nd December),\nwith a Plenary Session in the Main\nHall, on Saturday in three parallel\ntinder Presidents Gorbachev and Reagan we\nhave seen the world's first nuclear force\nreduction treaty\nPage 8 FELIX November 18 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nThe Beatles\nFELIX\ncatches up\nwith the\nlatest pop\nsensation\nIt would be hard to call the Beatles\nanything but the greatest rock band\nthe world has and will ever see.\nLove them, hate them, there is no\ndoubt that the talent of the group\nwas immense. And yet, their history\nis more colourful than your average\nteeny-bopper fad today.\nThe group were formed in 1959,\n' with a five man line up; John\nLennon, Paul McCartney, George\nHarrison, Stuart Sutcliffe (bass) and\nPete Best (drums), under the name\n'Johnny and the Quarrymen'. This\nname was change to the 'Silver\nBeatles' (inspired by Buddy Holly's Crickets) and finally shortened to\n'The Beatles'. The band first started\nplaying gigs in seedy night clubs in\nHamburg, Germany. However, the\nband, with the exception of\nSutcliffe, wanted to come back to\nEngland and were signed up by\nBrian Epstein as their manager.\nEpstein tried to get them signed up\nwith a major record company, but\nastonishingly found complete\napathy (one company, Decca,\nrejected them in favour of Brian\nPoole and the Tremeloes).\nHowever, one minor company\nPartophone, headed by George\nMartin, agreed to sign them up on\nthe condition that the drummer,\nBest, was replaced. Reluctantly,\nthey agreed to this, and Harrison\nrecruited a friend, Ringo Starr.\nThe group's first single, Love Me\nDo, was released in October 1962,\ndid moderately well, the follow-up\nPlease Please Me, was an enormous\nsuccess along with the similarly\ntitled debut album. Beatle-mania\nhad arrived.\nFrom this point to their break-up\nin 1970 all kinds of feats were\nachieved, too numerous to mention\nhere. Their high point was in 1964,\nwhen the Beatles were occupying\nthe top five positions of the US\nsingles chart along with another\nseven records in the US top one\nhundred. Event the top two US\nalbums were by the Beatles!\nThis success opened the\nfloodgates for British groups to the\nUS market, especially Liverpudlian\ngroups like Gerry and the\nPacemakers, which all played the\n'Merseybeat'. Even the Rolling\nStones would attribute their break\ninto stardom to Lennon and\nMcCartney, with the successful\ncover version of the song I Wanna Be\nYour Man.\nFor the eight years of the band's existence, the style of music went\nthrough some dramatic changes.\nThis is best seen in their album\nreleases. Their first four albums;\nPlease Please Me, With the Beatles, A Hard Day's Night, Beatles for Sale\nshowed the large influence from\nstars like Chuck Berry, Everley\nBrothers and Carl Perkins. Album\nthree and five (Help) were\nsoundtracks to the first two films\nthat the group made. However, by\nnumber six, Rubber Soul, they had\nmellowed into a more original and\ndistinctive approach without\nbecoming commercialised. Now\ncame a distinctive change in style as\nalbum number seven showed.\nwhich was based on characters in\nprevious Beatle songs; The White\nAlbum; and the immortal song, Hey\nJude, an anthem to Lennon's son,\nJulian.\n1969 was the final year of official\nactivities. The film Let it Be was\nstarted, but soon abandoned when\neach Beatle didn't want to work\nwith the other. Their final classic\nalbum, Abbey Road, showed the\nworld that it was all over. Paul\nMcCartney told the world that he\nwas leaving, on Friday 10 April\n1970. McCartney was known for his\ndislike of Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono.\nHe had also disagreed with the\nappointment of new manager, Alan\nKlein. McCartney officially made\nsure the Beatles were dead on\nJanuary 19 1971, when rumours of\na possible replacement for him were\ncirculated and Klein, with producer\nPhil Spector, finished and compiled\nthe film Let it be, so he was granted\na 'statement of motion'.\nSince then, the 'ex-Beatles' have\nRevolver was the beginning of the\ngroup's psychedelic phase. This was\nattributed to the group's retirement\nfrom touring, hence more studio\nwork and experimentation. With\nthis increased leisure time, they\nturned to drugs, especially\nhallucinogenic LSD and were also\nfascinated by Indian culture. After\nseven months in the studio, the\nfinest concept album of all time was\nreleased in June 1967 Sergeant\nPepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This\nmasterpiece was marred, however,\nby the early death of their manager,\nBrian Epstein, From here, the future\nof the Beatles looked bleak. Indeed\ntheir TV movie Magical Mystery Tour\nwas severely criticised by the press.\nAlso, Lennon and McCartney were\nnow fighting bitterly, and even\ndragged Harris and Starr into the\nbattle.\nDespite the setbacks, the final two\nyears saw legendary material being\nproduced; the film Yellow Submarine,\nall undertaken solo projects, though\nnot without controversy. Ringo\nStarr has had the lowest profile of\nall with a few cover versions of\nsongs, but a string of disastrous\nmovies, though one That'll Be The\nDay did stand out. The other three\nall enjoyed enormous success with\nat least one two million selling 45\"\nsingle each. Without doubt, the\nsaddest aspect of the breakup will\nbe the knowledge that Lennon and\nMcCartney never settled their\ndispute and never will be able to.\nIC Radio presents a one hour\nshow of Beatles and Beatles-related\nmaterial every Tuesday lunchtime at\nl pm. In addition, there is now a survey to find out IC students'\nfavourite three Beatles tracks, film,\nalbum and member of the band.\nYour top three singles will go to\nmake a top twenty to be played at\nthe end of the Christmas term.\nWatch out for your surveyor!\nEpilogue\nPicture your average U.C.C. A candidate in a few years time. He\nwants a good science degree from\na reputable university.\nAcademically, Imperial is top of\nthe list. He then asks himself, 'can\nI afford it ?.'\nWith the increase in rents, the\nprospect of poll tax and higher\ncosts of living alongside a frozen\nstudent grant and a loan system\nwhich is far from attractive is he\nnot more likely to sacrifice the\nacademic edge Imperial has and\nopt for a slightly lower standard\nof University in a more\nfinancially-sur viv able region?\nWe are reaching the stage\nwhere the economic disadvantage\nof a degree course at Imperial is\noutweighing the academic\nadvantage.\nIf Imperial is to retain its unique\nreputation as a leading centre of\nScience and Technology it is\nsurely in its interests to attack the\ntop brains from across the\ncountry, not the brains from one\nsmall sector of the population\nwho's financial standing enables\nthem to apply.\nCOMPETITION\nA farmer owns a circular field.
