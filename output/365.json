    "content": "FELIX 1\n1\ntimes, but it all seems to work out in\nthe end. An enjoyable film with more\nthan just a few adrenal in ic moments.\n99 and 44/100% Dead! (Richard Harris.\nDirector: John Frankenheimer).\nBIFF, BAM, thrills & spills, zap po,w app o, and didn't they do well? This film\nis of the traditionally well-made category\nand so in terms of innovation and originality\nit has i it tle to offer. However, it does go\nto show that even within the'conventional-CONTINUED FROM PAGE 9\ntype' film framework, it is still possible\nto produce a gutsy, kick-'em-in-the-teeth\nkind of picture.\nRichard Harris plays Harry Crown, the\nbest (the best) hit-man in the slimy\nbusiness, who has been hired by Uncle\nFrank (Edmund O 'Brien) to rub out Big\nEddie (Bradford Dillman).\nBig Deal, you might think. You would\nin fact be right - and it gets worse. Big\nEddie has hired 'Claw' Zuckerman (Chuck\nConnors), who harbours a personal vendetta\nagainst Harry Crown for cutting off his\nhand. Imagine Richard Harris' reaction to\nbeing told that his arch-enemy is on the\nbaddies' bench: A long pause, a grimace;\nthen the obligatory gritting of the teeth.\nClaw now has a gimmicky left hand stub\nto which can be fitted an assortment of\nvicious attachments (clearly a crib from\nBruce Lee's 'Enter The .Dragon'),\nThere's the final shoot-out, in a commercial laundry of all places. Maybe\nthey just wanted a paper-towel guillotine\nhandy for when it came to removing Claw's claw. When this happens, the result is a real grin: as opposed to artery blood, we\nare treated instead to the sight of spurts\nof lubricating oil and a very silly look\nClaw seeming just a trifle lost for words.\nIncidentally, I have not a clue what the\ntitle has to do with the story.\nSECONDS\nPaul Ekpenyong\nThe Mill Valley Bunch'Mill Valley Jam Sessions'\n(Polydor 2310 300).\nWhen you have musicians like Mike\nBloomfield, Mike Shrives (drummer with\nSantana), Spencer Dryden (drummer with\nJefferson Airplane) and the Pointer\nSisters to name but a few, the outcome of\nany jamming session is unlikely to be\nanything but good. This is the case with\nthis really excellent album.\nThe Mill Valley Bunch is so called\nbecause most of the musicians live in the\npicturesque Mill Valley area of San\nFrancisco.\nThe album starts off with quite a lively\ntune called 'I 've Had It'; I love the fiddle\non it. The next track, 'Young Girl Blues'\n(we all get them sometimes) is written by\nMike Bloomfield and is an ode to the great\nJanice Joplin who was to have performed\non the album. It reminds me of 'Just The\nBlues', and 'Jigsaw Puzzle Blues' on the\nalbum Fleetwood Mac and is really beautifully played in the relaxed, happy\natmosphere of true blues music.\nOn the next song the lady who gives\nsuch a superb solo performance is\nJeanette Jones who sings with a local\ngospel group. (A little gospel goes a long way). As if side one were not already\nfilled with good music, we have side two\ntaking excellence even further. The\nguitar work throughout is first class.\nThe music takes on a magical touch\nand it is as if one is floating in a fantasy\nworld. There is no need to single out\nany particular track, they are all finely\ndone. What more can one say? A really\nfine album. Let us hope we do not have\nto wait too long for more.\nDave Snell - 'plays hits on a harp'\nBBC Records REC 178.\nI wonder if he tuned his harp before\nhe started recording the album. This\nmediocre music which is supposed to\nput the harp on the spotlight, may have\ndone so but in the process has managed\nto virtually destroy twelve very popular\nclassics.\nAs far as innovations go we could\nhave done without this one. The harp is\nnot the instrument. of popular music,\ncan you imagine what Stevie Wonder's You Are the Sunshine of My Lite'\nsounds like on a harp, or 'Uy Qherie\nArmour' (totally beyond recognition),\" or\n'Guitar Man' or 'Mrs Robinson' the\nfamous Simon and Garfunkel classic\nfrom the film 'The Graduate'.*\nThe BBC should really have more\nsense than this, do they think that the\nmusic market is full of morons who are\njust dying for their latest fol ly in musical\naccomplishment. The mind boggles at\nwhat might have happened if popular\njazz tunes had been the victims of\n'harp mania'. I suggest very strongly to Mr. Snell\nthat a more appr opiate field of exploration\nis the classical one. This will, not only\nbring him greater success but will also\nbe a blessing for popular misi c lovers.\nHOOKS\nPhilip Webber\nWoody Guthrie: Bound for Glory\n(Picadore)\nMANY PEOPLE have attempted to\ncapture in a book America of the depression\nyears from the point of view of the down\nand outs. Until reading this, that always\nmeant for me John Steinbeck, who in\nGrapes of Wrath tried to put down America\nas 'She is spoke' straight from the mouths\nof the speakers.\nHere Woody Guthrie in an autobiographical style, has set down life as he\nsaw it, written as he would have said it\nor sung it.\nThe result is a down to earth account\nof life in a small Oklahoma town through\nthe boom years of oil discoveries and the\nterrible 1930 s between wars depression\nwhich also affected England at this time.\nBy not trying to polish up his writing\nstyle and thus using a large amount of\nslang and raw narrative, this book once\ngotten into, gives you the impression of\nhaving lived through it all yourself,\nbeing written in the way you see and\nhear things from memory.\nWoody Guthrie is thought of Hy many\nas the originator of modem American\nfolk singing, many of his son' \u2022 being still\nsung today.\nHis account of part of his life gives\nyou an insight into the inspiration that\nwent into his songs, which were the only\nthings between him and starvation for\nmany of the depression years. ,, .\nThe book is also a tribute to him,\nfirst published in 1943, a Forword by\nPete Seeger, a tribute by the Secretary\nof the Interior, and a Biographical Postscript have been added which are perhaps\na Iittle superfluous.\nTo sum up this is America by someone\nwho always bounced back, and who loved\nthe country,. appreciating its beauty and\npeople from hitched lifts, boxcars and by\nfoot, which is one hell of a' good way of\nmeeting a hell of a lot of people, if you\ncan play a guitar, especially like he could.\n\n"

    "content": "2 FELIX\nEDITORIAL\nMike Williams IN THIS special 'J 'Accuse' edition\nof FELIX, the Editor is under attack\n(see page 4) from two individuals. It\nis difficult to distinguish which has\nmade the bigger ass of himself. On a prominent note our illustrious President\nTrevor Phillips, at last stung in action,\nhas devoted more than half his PreciPice\nto criticising FELIX. We are extremely\nglad to have provided the President\nwith something to talk about. But what\nhas happened to the fine stirring issues\nthat occupied a whole page in the\nFreshers' Edition? Few of those\ntopics have been subsequently broached.\nIs it not only natural to ask what has\nhappened to the bold statements and\nthe fine rhetoric that was applauded\nat the Freshers' address? Your phrase\n'Ehobarbus to the Executive's Antony'\nis apt.\nThe other 'attack' comes from the\nonly ex-assistant Editor of FELIX,\nMr. Clive G. Dewey, who has written\nto give me a piece of his mind. An\nincident worth mentioning occured in\nconnection with the letter. 1 had asked\nMr. Dewey if he could point out any\nlibel against him in any of the past\nissues of FELIX. He looked. Pause.\nHe looked again. He found no libel.\nContentious matters of opinion, maybe,\nbut libel no.\nNevertheless, I am going to publicly\napologise to Mr. Dewey for any unintentional slights for which he feels\na certain redress may be necessary.\nIt is worth reiterating, however, that\nthe Editorial in question (Issue No. 364)\nwas, in fact, OK'd by John Allen,\nChairman of the Campus Radio Society.\nThe weekly 'Media meetings' held\nin the FELIX oil ce every Friday\nlunchtime and attended by Campus\nRadio, STOIC, Broadsheet, Guildsheet\nand Mines Newsletter bare their first\nfruit in the form of our centre-spread\nthis week. It was discovered on Friday\n11th that the RSMU 'Monkey Business'\nwas to take place the following morning.\nFortunately we were able to contact a photographer and reporter for the\nassignment, so all went well.\nThe point is, however, that it seems\nas if it were almost by coincidence that\nFELIX got to hear about the stunt at all.\nit is hoped therefore, that the weekly\nmedia meetings will establish a solid\ncommunications network in Imperial\nCollege.\nLETTERS\nTHOUGHTS FOR THE FUTURE Industrial\nSociology\nUnit.\nDear Sir,\nSo the election is over.\nWe can now view it in retrospect\nand ponder its possible consequences for ourselves. Then\nwe yield a bewildered sigh and\nask ourselves if all that fer v our was really justified. For me\nthe only vaguely inspiring\ncampaign was that of the 'don't vote' advocates. Of course they\ncould not be described as a united bunch; there were many\nreasons given to discourage\nvoters, but their common denominator was a feeling of the\nfutility of the whole masquerade.\nPeople have begun to realise\nthat election campaigns, indeed\nparty policies in any situation,\nare constructed from lies,\nmudslinging and meaningless\ncatch phrases beautifully\nillustrated by: 'Britain will\nwin with Labour', Put Britain\nfirst, vote Conservative' and\n'Put people first, join the\nLiberal crusade'. The public\nalso realises that whichever\nparty wins, the difference it\nmakes to the individual is\nentirely negligible.\nOne slogan which captures\nwell the mood of the electorate\nis that of the Liberals 'Take\nPower, Vote Liberal'. There is\ngrowing frustration in Britain\ndue to the belief that the\ncountry is being run by a small number of remote politicians who don't give a damn\nabout the individuals who make\nup the population, and who\nwould dearly love to have more\nsay in the running of their\nlives. There is evidence everywhere that people are becoming\nincreasingly alienated from the\ncountry's power structure,\nalienated from their jobs and\nalienated from the lifestyle that\nthis technological age has\nforced upon them. For example,\ntake the rejection of fluoridation\nproposals or protestation\nagainst motorway routes both\norganised at the local leveL\nPeople who are normally powerless take advantage of their\nopportunities to express resentment of political authority.\nThere are any number of small\nprotest groups, community groups\nand sympathy groups growing\nup all round us in defiance of\nour centralised authoritarian\ngovernment.\nFidel Castro said It is the\naim of the Cuban revolution to\nmake every man a legislator'.\nA fine sentiment and it is more\nthe pity that the Cuban government has to be repressive in\norder to make their system\nwork. Of course in Marx's ideal\nthe state is merely transient\nand, given time, it will 'wither\naway' leaving a true democracy.\nBut how long do we have to\nwait?

    "content": "FELIX SPORT\nCROSS COUNTRY\nANON\nHOCKEY\nA. BREWSTER\nDespite an appalling lack of fresh blood (spikes, barbed wire\netc., to be spilled on) and the where was last week's FELIX report inquisition, the IC Cross Country teams have started with\na bang. Already they have won more races then they did over the\nwhole of last season.\nWe have thrashed not only\nSussex University, not only the\nLSE, but also Kings College.\nAll by huge point scores and\nvast distances. This must be\ndue to the 'Go faster' Allinson\n(who always wins, damn him)\nand the Speedy Steve who is\nstill retaining second place,\njust.\nThe IC 3rd team suffered a notable loss as Dave Payne\nhit a tree trunk and sprained an\nankle, but at least Bob and\nPad managed to get him back\nhome (only 25mins. late, folks).\nDave is now recovering in the\nUnion bar and is expected to\nbe fit in about three weeks.\nIn fact, it must be noted\nthat the whole team is remarkably fit. Pad Donnelly is\nbeating LSE runners, this\nseason, even the inaugural\nmeeting of the Bell Sniffing\nsociety went according to plan.\nIf a little noisy.\nEvents to look forward to\ninclude the UC Relay (this\nSaturday), the second meeting\nof the Bell Sniffing society (Ad\nHoc), the first League Race\n(23rd October) and the first\nfootball match.\nGOLF\nNIGEL FOSTER\nThe 2nd XI 'bullied off\nthe season on Saturday with a massacre of Goldsmiths (7-2).\nThe score line reflects the\ndominance of IC in every sector\nof the pitch. The forward line\nwere particularly keen and alert\nwith Bruno Speed and A.N. Other\nboth netting hat ful s. Chas\nHardy helped himself to the\nseventh. All goals were well\ntaken and stemmed from good\nmidfield play.\nThe first of the goals\nconceded was a bad defensive\nerror and the second an inevitable result of complacency\nat being 7-1 up.\nThe teamwork was quite\nastounding for the first mater,\nof the season and I would like\nto take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the team on a superb performance. (P.S. As\nan incentive to play next week,\nthere is one jug still owing!).\nTeam: N. Harrison. J. Hackle,\nP. Nair. Y. Tan. A. Hall,\nD. Balderson, P. Nowell,\nI. Read, B. Speed. I. McLean,\nC. Hardy.\nUsing five stalwarts from\nthe second team to boost\nnumbers, the Thirds took to the\nfield in fine form, losing 4-0 to\nCamberley.\nMost people were glad they\nowned shin pads, both during\nthe game and after, when\nArthurs-Minions produced their\nhyper-crusty shepherds pie, in\ntraditional Cordon-Bennet\nmould. Mould \u2014 yes, every now\nand then I hit on an appropriate\nword.\nStill - this is what hockey\nis all about \u2014 to misquote\nJimmy Hill. We hope for better\nthings later in the season\n(perhaps curry?) when the team\nsettles down.\nThanks to all who played.\nAs we drive off into the new season it is pleasant to note that\nalmost all the people who spearheaded IC's overdue success in\ntop flight golf last year are still with us. Indeed with the exception\nof Chris Cobbledick (who has retired to the gentler pursuit of\nrugby) all our London University players are still keen to play an\nactive role in the battle ahead.\nAs for those who did not play\nfor London University but\ninstead chose to reserve their\nenergies for the more select IC\nteam, we can still rely on our\nstalwarts, many of whom are\nplaying so well now that last\nyears captain (the author) has\nfelt it expedient to retire from\nhis post lest he found it impossible to justify a place in\nhis own team. Indeed such\nwas his concern, that he has\nnow taken on the less rig our o us captaincy of a London University team which he feels obliged\nto mention, will be heavily\nbiased towards IC. Such is the\nimportance of an IC union card\nfor selection that Tony Jacklin\nhas elected to join Civ. Eng.\nrather than the US circuit this\nyear (a pre-press release!).\nBut this is not all. In our\ninflux of fresher s there appear\nto be some players of exceptional stature from whose divot-marks the future of the society\nwill be forged. Of the.se Edward\nClutton (3 handicaps) looks the\npick but there is an interesting\n9-hand ica g jp ef Bob Allan who\ncould prove a bandit off that\nmark and win the 'Rookie of the\nYear' award. It was probably\nwith this in mind that the\nmembers have elected him to\nthe Vice-Captaincy hoping to\nshorten his swing with paper-work. On this matter I recall\nremaining aloof since the swing\nshortening that resulted from\nthe abundance of secretarial\nwork we fed Jules Dan last year\nresulted in his playing beyond\nhis wildest dream (not a pretty\nsight!). His trophy stealing off\na cle p to maniac's24 handicap\nis now in the history books.\nLet's hope it stays there!\nAn interesting feature at the\nFreshers' Fair this year was\nthe enthusiasm of many ladies\nwho wished to join the society.\nMy immediate reaction was\n'No! This would leave a dis-cho ti my in many team members\nminds as to which 'hole-in-one'\nis of more importance!'However\nboth the charm of the ladies\nconcerned mingled with the\nkeenness of our men members\nto play the game with these\nIad'es, has led to an historic\naec is ion of the committee to no\nlonger bar women on account of\ntheir sex.\nThe captaincy this year has\ngone to How Rosser, a man\nfamiliar with all the devious\ntwists and turns that golf so\nreadily imposes.Onhis shoulders\nthe society can only blossom\nand with the likes of Bill Calderwood (Sec), Mike Marx\n(Treas.) and aforementioned\nBob Allen (V Capt.) as his\ncommittee perhaps we are headed\nfor a very special season.\nOnly time can tell.\nIt only remains for me to\nregister my gratitude to all\nthose who so ably assisted me\nin making last year so enjoyable.\nThe climax of the year for me\nwas our victory in the South\nand Eastern University Championships, as memorable an\nachievement as it was remarkable.\nRUGBY\nTHE HOTLINE GOT SOME INTERESTING\nINFORMATION? LET\nFELIX KNOW ABOUT IT.\nRING\nln t.2881 IC Extra l sts made a very\ngood start to the season in their\nfirst game which was against\nOld Kingsburians. After pressuring the opposition for the\nfirst five minutes a dropped ball\nled to a lucky break for Old\nKingsburians and they got their\none and only try.\nFinally the hard work payed\noff and things started to click.\nS. Ladle opened up the scoring\nand from then on the game\nlooked one sided with the score\n16-4 at half time. The backs\ntried varying moves and with\nforwards in constant support\nIC over an the opposition with a final score of 60-4.\nI hope this is a premonition\nfor what the rest of the season\nwill be like for us. More players\nare needed so that we can get\nmore sides out and give every*\none a game. See Bruce Bradley,\nRob Jones or myself if you\nwant a game on Saturdays.\nSteve Chudy.\nTeam: D. Wollen, S. Ladle,\nJ. Gilbert, R. Abel, C. Whiteley,\nD. Forbes, T. Fern, A. Whiteside,\nA. Fitzgerald, M. Sergot. A. Rice,\nR. Sutton, S. Churdy, I. White,\nM. Kilbride.\n\n"

    "content": "PiG\nAFFAIRS\nCORNER\nTom Abraham\nTHIS CORNER, if any of you have not yet realised it, is the\nofficial mouthpiece of the Postgraduates at Imperial College.\nImperial College PG group (ICPGG) has decided to concentrate\non academic affairs in the coming session. I shall, therefore,\ndetail the main topics to be discussed, in this article, and during\nthe next few weeks or so, there will be various articles by other\nPostgraduate students on these and other issues.\nThe main topics of interest are:\n1. Status of Postgraduates.\nPostgraduates form a hybrid\ngroup between the main student\nbody and the staff. At the\nmoment students either support\nthemselves or get a grant from\none of the Research Councils.\nWhile the first year of a Phd\ncourse can be described as a 'training period', the last two\nyears tend to be more of a 'working period'. In this\nrespect the charge that we are\neffectively cheap research\nlabour is definitely valid after\nthe first year. Hence, a change\nin status from being students\nin our first year, to being paid\nresearch workers in the subsequent years, would be a much\nfairer proposition than the-existing status quo.\n2. PG's versus Unions.\nAt present we are all supposed to be members of the\nstudents Union. In the past\nICU has tended to neglect\nPostgraduates, partly due to\nown fault, and partly due to\nthe lack of effective representation within the Union\nhierarchy. There is a motion\npending, to make the PG Affairs\nOfficer a full member of the\nExecutive and it will be\ninteresting to see the reaction\nof the UGM to this proposal.\nMeanwhile, there are two other\nUnions who are also interested\nin Postgraduates \u2014 namely the\nAUT and ASTMS. Out of these\ntwo, a national agreement of\nsorts has been reached with\nASTMS, but as far as the AUT\nis concerned, they have been\nhamstrung by their internal\nbureaucracy and have got no\nofficial policy on Postgraduates.\nIn my opinion, the best course\nfor Postgraduate students,\nwould be to continue as full\nactive members of ICU, but at\nthe same time to open up a dialogue with other interested\nunions.\n3. Postgraduates and\nSupervisors.\nAny discussion on this issue\nis fraught with obvious problems.\nWhile I agree that it is not\npossible to legislate for student-supervisor relationships, the\npresent system is in need of\nchange.Col lect iver esp on sibi Ii ty by a group of supervisors for a given number of students might\nbe a better alternative.\n4. Overseas Postgraduates.\nHaving overseas Postgraduates at Imperial College has\noften been described as a means\nof providing aid to developing\ncountries. This is far from\nbeing the whole truth \u2014 admitting somebody from the\nwilds of Papua to do a research\ndegree in plasma physics, is\nof little or no benefit to the\npeople of Papua. Only projects\nwith some relevance to the\nstudent's home country would\nbe of any benefit. Imperial\nCollege, to the best of my\nknowledge, only offers projects\nand research work on topics\ndirectly related to their country.\nThese are but sketchy\ndescriptions of the various\nissues which we hope to con-front. We would welcome any\nreaction, from staff or students\non any of these issues. I will\ntry and give every point of view\nfull coverage in FELIX (I have\nalready negotiated for space).\nIf you wish to write anything,\nplease send it to The PG Affairs Officer, IC Union.\nI.C. Society For Social Responsibility\nIn Science (ICSSRS).\n\"PROBLEMS IN THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY\"\nDR. LEO PYLE, CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, I.C. WED. 23RD OCTOBER, 1.00 p.m. PHYSICS 536\nOO esA o^^S j lH ChOI. C& ADI0\nKX)\nGENERAL MEETING\nMonday, 21st October at 6.00 p.m. in the Union SCR\n1. Progress Report\n2. Election of Station Officers.\nNEW MEMBERS WELCOME\nLecture by Dr. Simon Mitton.\nRichard War ing Dr. Mitton attacked Von Daniken on his lecture on whether\nextra terre sti al life exists. For his pains he was viciously setup on in question time by Daniken followers and allies in the audience.\nThe lecture began with a review of speculation about life in\nour solar system. Topics mentioned ranged from religious dogma\n(an Italian was burnt at the stake in the 1600's for suggesting a plurality of inhabited worlds) to todays view that the only place\nof biological interest, besides\nearth, in our solar system is\nJupiter, with its complex molecules which could form the\nsource of life. In between times\nthere were hoax dispatches\nfrom Herschels observatory to\nthe New York Times consisting\nof engravings of inhabitants of\nthe moon, and Howell with his\ntheories of Martian Canali and\ncivilisation.\nDr. Mitton then reminded us\nthat organic molecules have\nbeen proved to exist in interstellar space. The nebula\ncontain not only the material\nto form stars but also the\nbuilding blocks of life. Planets\nof other stars have been detected\nby tiny fluctuations in the\nstars position. So planets exist\nand the material for life exists,\nbut does extra terre sti al life?\nDr. Mitton moved on into what\nwas expected to be the most\ninteresting part of his lecture.\nHe stated, ' As earth has not\nbeen visited the number of\ncivilisations must be very\nlimited'. Heexplainedhis belief.\nMany civilisations could not\nagree to leave us alone. One\nexpanding civilisation would\nfill the galaxy in 5,000 million\nyears. Interstellar travel was\nnot difficult and would always\nbe accomplished. Not all\ncivilisations would develop\non 'spiritual' rather than 'tech-n ical' lines.\nVon Daniken's postulates,\nhe said, were too near what we\ncould achieve now; they were\njust not imaginative enough to\nbe of worth as regards advanced\nextra terre sti als. UFO sightings\ncould all.be explained by the\nidea of untrained observers and\nmeteorological phenomena.\nQuestioners in the audience\nviciously attacked these last\ntwo points; one of whom had\nthe closing word: 'Is it not\npossible that the most imaginative teat that an advanced\nvisitor could produce would be\nan edifice (such as the great\npyramids) which man would\nonly realise that it could not\nhave been constructed by his\nancestors until sufficiently\nadvanced?'. Dr. Mitton shrugged\nsaid he had an open mind, and\nleft for Cambridge in his flying\nsaucer.\n\n"

They pounced on large numbers of the public going\nunsuspecting ly about their daily business, thrusting a red plastic\ncan forwards with their fearsome battle cry of 'Leukemia Research\nFund'. These fortunate (?)\nvictims were allowed to freely\npart with their shekels, in a manner which has been described as being in the true\ntradition of the Dane-Geld and\nAl Capone.\nYes folks, this was an\nR.S. M. rag stent using ten hired\nape suits.\nYour FELIX Reporter was\nright there with his own collection can (though not disguised\nas an ape) observing the\ninstantaneous honor, amusement\nand havoc created by this\npseudo-anthropoid parade.\nProgress was rapid along\nBrompton Road to Harrods with\nvigorous collecting all the way.\nSurprisingly perhaps there were\nfewer contributors outside\nHarrods than elsewhere (maybe\nthey were saving their money\nfor inside). Just along from\nthere, two certain apes (one\ntall, one short) were seen\ntrying to crack the combination\nof a night safe \u2014 difficult when\nits fitted with a key-lock. But\nit doesn't really matter, the\nessence of good collecting is\nto do something to get yourself\nnoticed. If what you do is funny\nor odd or silly, even better; it\nputs people in a happy, generous\nframe of mind. A certain amount\nof persistence is also required.\nOne great advantage of the ape-suits was that it allowed the\ncollectors to get away with\nthings that would be impossible\nif ordinarily dressed.\nThe apes went towards the\nKings Road: chasing girls into\nshops \u2014 then taking a collection\ninside; attempting to climb\nlamp-posts; putting arms round\ngirls, and men (ducky), until\nthey donated. People in fur\ncoats being easiest to win over-stroke and 7 knew him when he\nwas alive'.\nOne ape had a banana donated\nto him, several joined bus\nqueues temporarily. One woman\ncalled it disgraceful that grown\nmen (compliment) should run\naround dressed up to get money.\nA policeman checked collecting\nlicences after a complaint from\na rival conventional standing\nstill charity.\nGood fun was had by all.\nEventually everyone returned\nto college by separate routes,\nwith 14 near full collection\ncans.

    "content": "FILIX SI.C& ADIO\nooH \u00ae Qe^ iac*^ hoc John Allen Since there are so many people new to both the College and\nBritain, now seems a good time to look at what is available to\nLondoners on the radio. There are two main types, BBC and\nCommercial Radio. The BBC runs four national networks and\nmany small local stations. The commercial stations are mostly\nlarge local ones.\nBBC Radio 1 247m7a.m. \u20147p.m.,10 p.m.12 p.m. The daytime programmes are commercial and 'teeny-bopper'\npop. Most of the DJs are nauseating in the extreme, try Tony\nBlackburn (9a.m.12).I can recommend Johnnie Walker (12\u20142p.m.)*s the best of the bunch. Nightime 'Sounds of the Seventies'\ncaters for the heavier music scene and goes out on Radio 2 VHF\nalso, since medium wave reception is so poor. At other times it\nrelays Radio 2.\nBBC Radio 2 1500m and VHF\n5a.m. \u20142a.m. The BBC's easy listening network, quite a good station of\nit's kind, has feature programmes during the evenings and part\nof the weekend. Suffers (but not as badly as Radio 1) from not\nbeing able to play many records and having to rely on studio\ntapes.\nBBC Radio 3 464m and VHR\n7a.m. \u2014midnight.\nA highbrow network - there's a' lot of classical music and of\nit's kind-must be the finest in the world.\nBBC Radio 4 330m and VHR\n6.30p.m. \u2014midnight.\nMostly news and spoken voice programmes, some fine drama,\nfeatures, magazine programmes and really good news magazines\nin the morning, lunchtime and teatime. What the BBC is best at.\nBBC Radio London 206m and VHR\n5a. nr.-2a.m. The largest BBC local station, too large to be local in fact,\nthey try valiantly, some of the programmes are good, but are done\nwith very limited finances and record time. It tends to mean not\nmuch to non-Londoners. Give it a try, particularly recommended\nis Robbie Vincent's programme on Saturday lunchtime.\nRadio Luxembourg 208m usually 7.30p.m.3 a.m. The only really national commercial station. Specially aimed\nat fifteen year old girls. Not so bad after midnight.\nCapitol Radio\n24 hours a day\n539m and 95.8 VHF\nLondon's most popular commercial station. It has more time\nto play records (about the same as Radio 1 and 2 together).\nDuring the day they play 'quality pop' with features. More specialist and chat programmes at night. Particularly recommended\nare Kenny Everett (6.30-9.00a.m.) and Nicky Home's Rock Show\n(6.30-8.30p.m.). Not so good at weekends.\nEE A THER\nATIC\nMike Baume The auspicious visit to Imperial College of Lord Feather,\nformer General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, could\nnot have come at a more appropriate time than that of an impending\nGeneral Election.\nAlthough his frequent humorous remarks retained a familiar\nelectioneering air, his talk on 'The History and Economics of\nthe Political Scene' gave a valuable insight into the attitudes\nand policies of the T.U.C. He briefly traced the ascent\nof working class representation,\nreflected in the consolidation\nof Trades Unions and the\ngrowth of the Labour Party.\nConcentrating on current\nevents, he expounded the\nT.U.C. policy of consultation\nand negotiated with government\nwith particular reference to\nthe Social Contract. He s tren u sous ly dismissed criticism\nthat the Social Contract was a sham, reaffirming his belief\nthat it was, opposed to leg-isla tion, the more realistic\napproach to improving industrial\nrelations, even though total\nsupport by all members of the\nT.U.C. could not be guaranteed.\nRegarding the nationalised\nindustries, he reminded the\naudience that the Government\nheld down prices and thus\nsub sidi sed the private sector.\nDiversification of a nationalised\nindustry into lucrative subsidiary fields which depend on\nthe basic commodity it supplies\nshould, in Lord Feather's view,\nbe encouraged not hindered\nthereby increasing the profitability of the industry.\nDiscussing the Common\nMarket, he saw the Community\ndeveloping through re negotiation. He did not consider that\nBritain's membership should\nbe decided by a referendum.\nWhen asked how he found\nthe House of Lords, he replied\nthat he would not be changed by\nit and indeed, the impression\nleft by this man, enthusiastically\nreceived by a full house, was\nnot Lord Feather, elder statesman but Vic Feather, Trades\nUnionist.\nLBC 417m and 97.3 VHF\n24 hours a day\nBritain's first commercial station, totally news orientated,\nnational and international on the hour and local on the half hour.\nNews magazines are good but the news bulletins tend to break\nup other programmes unnaturally. Fascinating phone-in for in-s omni acs. Not the ideal format for a commercial station.\nRadio Caroline 252m7 p.m. \u20146a.m. The Radio Caroline of the 60's \u2014 but barely recognisable as\nsuch. They broadcast from a boat in the Thames Estuary, claiming\nto be on 259m but their slide rule is obviously not as accurate as\nmine. A totally album station with a wide variety of music, reception varies but it's certainly worth a try. Watch out for their\nround the clock Top 40 service on 389m in a couple of months.\nPirate Stations.\nWatch out for these at the weekends, likely frequencies are\n221m,227m,266m and VHF. What they lack in professionalism\nthey have in enthusiasm.\nI.C. Radio\nShould be on the air within six months and looks like giving\nthe above a good run for their money.\nSorry if I 've missed your favourite station, mine went off the\nair six weeks ago\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX J PRE en PJC E IT HAS never been the Union's policy,\nor the intention of its officers, to interfere\nin any way with the Editorial independence\nof the Union's publications, nor is it my\nintention in this article, to enter any\ndialogue on debate with FELIX on\nmaterial that has been printed in the\npaper.\nHowever, if the Union finances a publication, I think that it has a right\nand a duty to expect certain standards\nof accuracy in reporting and of presentation. Let me hasten to say that in\nboth respects, this year's FELIX is\nsuperior to those that have gone before;\nbut I feel that it might be in order for me\nto point to at ew instances through which\nthe Union might have suffered.\nFirstly, there was the Court Line\ndisaster. The sentence which read\n'Courtline has Imperial College as\none of its creditors to the extent of\n\u00a325,000', was, of course, libellous.\nAction could have been taken against\nthe Union, purely because of sloppy\nreporting. In that respect, I think that\nthe Union has a right to be concerned.\nSecondly, we come on to the issues,\ninternal in nature, where FELIX, no\ndoubt, has attempted to play the role of\nEnobarbus to the Executive's Antony;\nbringing us down to earth, exposing our\nshortcomings and puncturing our egos.\nI note, for instance, in the FELIX Midweek Special of 3rd October, that the\nEditor says that we had 'pretentiously\ndecided' that he would be Publicity\nOfficer. What we were doing, in fact,\nwas interpreting previous policy, which\nis, historically, one of the Executive's roles.\nIn the FELIX of 11th October, the\nEditor decided to feature the last UGM\nand the poor attendance at that meeting.\nHe puts it down to poor quality of the\nTrev Phillips\nUGM. Now, for the 1st UGM of the year,\nwhat is likely to attract people? Surely,\nthe publicity for the event; but Mike\nhim se If says that this is his resp on sibi Ii ty-so who is at fault? The most widely\nexpressed opinion about the UGM that I have heard was that the publicity for the\nmeeting was 'pusillanimous and\nuninspiring in the extreme', to quote the\nEditor. The posters were not outstanding;\nin fact, I think that the Publicity Officer\nshould admit that at least half the work\n(including all the distribution) was done\nby myself; and that is not my job. I accept that, since Mike had no other help\nin this task, it was difficult; but the\nblame should not be shifted (however\nsubtly) on to the Executive.\nFinally, we did have a few cans of\nlager in wh i le doing Parking applications;\nwould you sit and mark crappy, boring\napplications for 6V2 hours at a stretch,\nwithout some refreshment?\nI noted Mr. R.J. Merwood's letter in\nthe last FELIX. He raised several issues\nof crucial importance to students,\nparticularly accommodation, student\nmaintenance and academic problems.\nYet he claims to be alarmed at the intrusion of 'politics' into student affairs.\nPolitics, Mr. Merwood, is the art of\ngovernment; are grants, accommodation,\nand education abstract issues that bear\nno relation to the condition of our\nsociety, and therefore are not affected\nin anyway by the governance of that\nsociety?\nIf they are. who determines grant\nlevels, the way we are taught and so on,\nand with what priorities? I think that\nanything but a very narrow view will\nshow that most issues that involve the\nconditions of work and quality of life\nfor students are very strongly influenced\nby external factors.\nYou may escape that conclusion;\nbut I am entrusted with the responsibility\nto find solutions to your problems and I cannot escape it. I do not expect anyone\nto call for a revolution in IC; but I do\nexpect people to take a balanced, mature\nand progressive view \u2014 isn't this what\neducation is about?\nReports for UGM's will not be read\nout in future; you should be able to get\nhold of duplicated reports before UGM's in your pigeonholes; there will now be\nno 'Report' items, just 'Question Time'.\nThis should cut out the boring bits.\n(Bitch, bitch. Agreed the Courtline\nstory was libellous, but the reporting\nwas not 'sloppy' since it was reported\nin good faith from two separate sources.\nAs far as the 'pre le'n lio us ly decided'\nbit, the word 'decided' was actually\nused by one of your Executive. It was\nsimply and only the use of that particular word which warranted the mention\nof the incident. UtiM et al: I did not\nsay in my Editoral that the poor attendance was due to the poor quality of the\nUGM. That is your own rather sloppy\ninterpretation. As regards blaming the\nposters for a poor attendance, that\nmust surely be the cheapest trick of\nall. Clearly, against such opposition\nas Vic Feather, the posters deserve\ncredit for the response they produced\n(he said tongue in cheek) \u2014 Editor).\nLETTERS cont'd were expressing some sort of\nprotest. It would be fair to\nbelieve that the last two\nelections have shown that the\npublic are not prepared to give\na mandate to any party, to\ngovern in the present system.\nPeople are beginning to object\nto the Westminster centralisation\nof power. Until something\nhappens, we will live out our\npowerlessness and meaning-less ness lives with the Labour\ngovernment.\nYours faithfully,\nAndrew T. Osborne.\n- 528, Linstead Hall.\nSW7 ILU.\nOct. 14th.1974. Sir,\nI should like to complain\nabout a paragraph in your last\nEditorial, published in FELIX\non 11th October '74. In it, you\napologised to John Allen and\nthe other committee members\nof IC Campus Radio Society,\nfor what you termed a 'regretful\nerror' in your previous Edit on al. You claim that you 'had, in all\nhonesty, been led to believe'\nthat one individual had been\nessentially responsible for\nestablishing Campus Radio.\nFor the benefit of FELIX\nreaders I should like to point\nout your blatant and deliberate\nattempt to mislead and deceive\nthem. When you appointed me\nas an Assistant Editor to\nFELIX in June, I made a point\nof informing you that ICCRS\nwas run by a committee of\nseven people; each having an\nequal responsibility for the\nwork necessary to establish\na Student Radio Station here.\nIf this hadn't been the case,\nand I, solely had been responsible for establishing it,\nI would not have become an\nAssistant Editor; and 1 hope,\nfor the sake of FELIX, that\nyou would not have appointed\nme.\nYou had a more recent\nreminder of this, just before\nthe beginning of this term. In\nthe fresher s' Editorial of\nFELIX, I wrote a piece about\nIC Radio, and advised anyone\ninterested to come and see\neither me, or four other members\nof the committee, whose\ncollege addresses were\nsupplied. Of the remaining\ntwo committee members, one\nis a technician in Electrical\nEngineering, and the other a physicist whose hall address\nwas not known at the time.\nYou can not claim that you\nhad nothing to do with the\narticle, since you edited it,\nand I was in the office when\nyou did so.\nWhilst I may have done\nsome active campaigning for\nCampus Radio you were under\nno illusions that a committee\nwas establishing it rather than\njust one person. I therefore,\nthink that an apology is due,\nnot only to me and the other\nsix hard-working committee\nmembers of ICCRS, but to\neveryone who reads FELIX\nfor the deceitful and despicable way in which you\nhave used your position as\nEditor. Should you wish to\ncontinue slights of this sort,\nI have no doubt that your\nactions will eventually lead\nto your being sued for libel.\nAs someone who is dedicated\nto providing IC with a better\nmedia service, I hope that\nyour jibes at me and IC Radio\nwill cease, so that ICCRS\ncan get on with the job in\nhand, rather than be continually\nasking you for Editorial\napologies. Only in this way-can IC Radio, FELIX and\nSTOIC work together to\nimprove the media here.\nYours faithfully,\nClive G. Dewey.\n(It seems to me a great pity\nthat you did not rather more\nclosely consult your committee\nbefore writing this letter. Mr.\nJohn Allen, the Chairman of\nthe Campus Radio Society,\nhad in fact OK'd the Editorial\nin question so a second\napology to John would be\nquite unnecessary. As regards\nyour own position in Campus\nRadio, I was genuinely of i he opinion that you were seen to\nbe doing a lot of work. The\nconjecture was, albeit wrong,\nthat you were establishing\nCampus Radio. This is still\npopular opinion, as some of\nyour own committee will tell\nyou.\nAs far as your spiteful\ncomments regarding my\nposition as Editor, this sort\nof tantrum is to be expected\nafter one's pride is hurt so\nI 'll say no more.)\nCorrespondence on this\nsubject is now closed.\n\n"

    "content": "FOUNDED IN 1141 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION FREE! No. 365. FRIDAY, 18th OCTOBER 1974\nECTOR OUT\nA BLEAK FUTURE\nLAST MONDAY night at the first Imperial College Union\nCouncil meeting of the session, Sir Brian Flowers, the\nRector of the College, spoke of the 'bleak future' that faces\nI.C. should the Government not step in with financial aid.\nIn an unprecedented speech\nto the Union's premier com-mitte e, the Rector gave details\nof recommendations which\nare to be made to the College's Board of Governors on\nDecember 20th. To begin with\nthere is expected to be a2% cut across the board in College\nexpenditure. This may not seem\na very harsh move, but when\none considers that the vast\nmajority of the College's money goes on salaries which will\nnot be cut, the fact is that\nthere will probably be cuts of\nup to 15% on money which\npeople can still take decisions\non. There will be two ex-clu s ions to the 2% cuts:\nFirstly, maintenance because\nif there were to be any cutback in that area, matters\ncould only become much worse;\nand secondly, the grant to\nthe Union, for it is genuinely\nfelt by the Rector that we\nhave enough problems of our\nown without having to suffer\na2% cut.\nThe Rector put the\nsituation in a nutshell: 'For\nImperial College, the excess\nof expenditure over income is\nnow running at the rate of\n\u00a3500,000 per annum. If this\nwere to continue, in eighteen\nmonths time Imperial College\nwould be in the red and unable\nto meet its commitments \u2014\nunable to pay salary bills,\nelectricity bills etc'.\nWhilst it is hoped that\nGovernment aid via the University Grants Committee will\nbe forthcoming, if this were\nnot the case then further,\nmore drastic cuts may be\nexpected in the region of 6 to\n8%. It would also appear\nunlikely that the Union would\nbe excluded from these\nmeasures.\nAnother subject which the\nRector broached during his\nspeech was the Murray Report.\nThis report was originally\ncommissioned to determine\nhow the University of London\ncould best organise itself\nrecognising its growth and the\ninherent complexities associated therewith.\nOne of the suggestions of\nsignificance to the College\nwas that Imperial should lose\nits present facility of direct\naccess to the UGC. This\nparticular suggestion, the\nRector stated, caused a big\nstir when it was first pointed\nout and many people in the\nCollege were all for getting\nout of the University and\ngoing independent.\nSince then things have\nsettled, the Murray Report\nhas been thrown out and a new\ncommittee has been set up\nof which the Rector is a member and the Secretary is a member of the Secretariat\nwhich serves the committee.\nThis new committee's brief\nis to plan the whole University's future for the next\nquin que n niu m.

    "content": "FELIX3<7 F Only?.\nKatie McKinnon\nIF / Mine's Dance or Not so much a cattle market more a cattle show.\nLast Thursday evening saw the opening of what promise's to\nbe a very exciting season for both Mines United and IF Wanderers.\nMines were playing at home and felt a distinct advantage but IF\nare familiar with the pitch and were confident. Kick off was due\nat eight o 'clock but there was some trouble opening the gates\n(bolt failure) and the match finally started ten minutes late.\nFrom the start officials\nhad trouble controlling the\nenthusiasm of the crowd and\nclub manager, Pat Gorman,\nexpressed concern that IF\nsupporters might break down\nthe barriers but his fear was\nunfounded and the fans were\non the whole well-behaved.\nBoth clubs were very well\nsupported, a fact which is\nquite unprecedented for IF\nwho have in the past suffered\na great deal from the indifference\nof its members.\nThe evening began by\nSaunders and Butler opening\nthe play. An unparalleled\ndisplay of skill was in evidence,\nno doubt due to the intensive\ntraining sessions both players\nhave undergone during the\npast few weeks. However,\nCatchpole was not to be outdone and with a crafty\ninterception left the ball in the\ncompetent hands of Griffiths\nwho was then disqualified for\nhandling. The game gathered\npace as Caleott, marked by\nPartridge, led the team upfield\nand the rest of the players\nstarted pulling their weight.\nBy half-time it was neck and\nneck.\nAfter the interval the\nplayers returned, visibly\nrefreshed, to take up their\npositions and play recommenced.\nBai ley, with Robinson's hacking, seemed to make good headway\nbut after a three minute spell,\nthrew away a good chance of a goal and proceeded for the\nrest of the game to back up\nthe morale of the team. The\nmatch was finally decided in\nthe closing three minutes of\nthe game when IF, de moral is ed by the skilful passing by the\nMines team, were caught with\ntheir defences down; Mines\nmoved quickly into attack and\nscored the winning goal.\nHowever, there was no hard\nfeelings amongst the IF players,\na good time was had by all and\nit is hoped that there will be\na return match in the very\nnear future.\nAs usual, rumour rears its\nugly head in the shady corridors\nof IC and speculator, falls on\na certain Alexandre Esq.,\ninmate of IF.
