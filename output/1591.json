Do you find yourself\nsweating over notes and\nbooks, asking yourself who invented\npre-Christmas exams? Well, we\u2019re all\nin the same boat.\nThe revision period can be an\nintense time, when it seems like\neverything in the world revolves\naround your subject. Bottom line,\nit does. But it can be useful to allow\nyourself a responsible break after a\ncouple of hours\u2019 intense studying.\nTelevision can be a useful distraction.\nThere are, however, a couple of\ndos and don\u2019ts to bear in mind, and\nseveral rookie mistakes to avoid.\nThe ideal TV-break is around\ntwenty minutes long. Handily,\nseveral TV series follow this format.\nSpecifications, however, don\u2019t end at\nlength.\nIt is important to choose something\nlight-hearted, which won\u2019t leave you\npondering about the meaning of\nlife. This excludes shows like Modern\nFamily which, despite the humour,\nmay tempt you into calling your\nmother for a three hour conversation\nabout your crushed soul and dreams.\nMost important of all, the show\nmust prove entertaining, yet not\nsufficiently entertaining to become\naddictive. This is a subtle distinction\nthat excludes all spy shows (luckily\nrarely twenty minutes long anyway)\nand love plots like How I Met Your\nMother. Friends is another no-no. We\nmay have all watched it hundreds of\ntimes, but there is nothing stopping\nus from going through the whole\nthing once more just for the 1990s\nnostalgia.\nThese criteria may seem quite\nselective, but actually there are\nseveral shows that fit the bill.\nEvergreens like 30 Rock, Parks and\nRecreation and Community are happy,\nidle shows, basically created exactly\nfor this purpose. New releases are\ngood alternatives, in particular the\nshows Black-ish, starring Laurence\nFishburne, and A to Z.\nThe first is a new family sitcom.\nThe Johnson family, however, is not\nthe typical American TV family. No\nsugary tough love, pets and candy\nin this show. Dre Johnson (Anthony\nAnderson), the father, is a self-made\nAfro-American man who\u2019s arrived.\nAs a result his children, grown up\nin a privileged neighbourhood, are\n\u201ctoo white\u201d for his tastes. This is pure\nsatire, and definitely worth a watch if\nForget Brian Cox and David Attenborough.Forget science\ndocumentaries about space and animals,for a little while\nat least.There\u2019s a new generation of TV presenters giving us\ninsights into big cities,old jazz clubs and sacred rivers and\nwe are deinitely digging it.\nDr James Fox,art historian and Cambridge Fellow,takes us\nthrough three of the cities that marked our popular culture.\nIn the documentary BrightLights,BrilliantMinds,Fox travels\nfrom 1908\u2019s Vienna to 1928\u2019s Paris and a little further to 1951\u2019s\nNew York.\nThrough a heterogeneous mix of interviews,original clips\nand walks through the places that inspired the greatest\nthinkers of the 20th\ncentury,Dr Fox illustrates some of the\nevents that shaped the way we think.Greenwich Village\nand the Beat Poets\u2019apartments,surrealist cinemas in the\nQuartier Latin and Sigmund Freud's ofice are all connected\nthrough a thread that,once explained,appears almost\nenlightened.\nFox\u2019s commentary is entertaining and charming.In a\nslightly awkward,adorable manner,he paints the lives of\nMagritte,Klimt,Cole Porter and Kerouac.He is essentially\nbeing paid to go on the trip of a lifetime,living the life of a\nFrench intellectual while hobnobbing in New York\u2019s best\njazz clubs.And we envy him for it.\nSacredRiverswithSimonReeve shows us another journey,\none that is more adventurous and spiritual than Fox\u2019s.\nThe show is a discovery of different parts of the world and\ntheir essential connection to sacred rivers.The Yangtze,\nthe Ganges and the Nile are some of the longest and\nlargest rivers in the world,and to the people who live along\ntheir path they are a source of food,water,religion and\ncommunity.\nAlong with the show,Simon Reeve is a revelation.\nEntertaining,sharp and always ready to get his hands dirty,\nhe is a true modern day adventurer.Unlike many of his\npredecessors,his attitude to local costumes is one of awe and\nexcitement and not of patronising judgement.\nWhether it\u2019s jumping the Nile or swimming across the\nYangtze,Reeve is always ready for a laugh.This documentary\nis so good,it is impossible not to fall in love with some of\nthese places.But more importantly,it is impossible not to\nfall in love with the presenter.\nGIULIA GABRIELLI\nPhotos: BBC\nuncomfortable humour is what rocks\nyour boat.\nA to Z is a traditional romantic\ncomedy, created thinking that\nwe hadn\u2019t seen enough of Cristin\nMilioti since the end of How I Met\nYour Mother. Despite this being\nprofoundly untrue (we did, after all,\nspend ten years of our lives hearing\nstories about her), this is a sweet\nand lovable show with one great\nadvantage. The main characters get\ntogether at the beginning of Episode\n1. The programme from then on is\nsupposed to be a recollection of their\nrelationship. With no will-theywon\u2019t-they chemistry, this is a series\nthat won\u2019t keep you waiting to long\nfor answers, but that will still make\nyou smile.\nFor idle watching, MTV always\noffers something. Lately the teenage\ncomedy-drama Faking It is probably\nthe strongest show on the channel\n(which admittedly is not saying\nmuch). The series follows the lives\nof best friends Amy and Karma\nwho, in a school too Glee-like for\nwords, fake being lesbians to attract\nattention. This premise may repulse\nsome of you, but the way in which the\nhomosexuality theme is touched by\nthe show is surprisingly refreshing.\nFinally, all these considerations\nare useless without the appropriate\ndegree of self-control. If you find it\nhard to say stop, don\u2019t press play, go\nfor a walk. In these occasions even\nadverts can become slightly addictive.\nWatching the John Lewis penguins\nplay around for the fiftieth time may\nseem more stimulating than revising\nthe Krebs cycle, but it won\u2019t be on the\nexam.\nGiulia Gabrielli gives us a selection of the best shows for unwinding\nRevision 101: a short television\nguide to 20 minute breaks\n\n"

    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n05.12.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow Reddit made it okay to hate women\nLast week I wrote in Felix about\n\u2018GamerGate\u2019, a loosely defined\nmovement nominally about\n\u201cethics in video game journalism\u201d. In\nthe article I outlined how really the\nmovement is about harassing women\nonline.\nBut GamerGate wasn\u2019t created\nwhen some developer was accused\nof sleeping around: it\u2019s the latest\nmanifestation of a long history of\nonline misogyny. Specifically, the\nkind that\u2019s become the accepted\nnorm in certain dark corners of\npopular forums like Reddit and\n4chan.\nLet me start by saying that Reddit is\na very large and diverse website, with\nforums for every topic imaginable,\nand people from all walks of life.\nYou want a forum (\u2018subreddit\u2019) for\nscience? Game of Thrones? Horror\nstories? All this and more awaits you!\n4chan, on the other hand, is less\nwelcoming. It\u2019s notorious for being\na vile place, where anonymity allows\npeople to be quite cruel. It\u2019s perhaps\nless surprising that 4chan has become\na haven for online misogyny, but\nReddit\u2019s a different case.\nReddit has a dark side, and it\u2019s a\nbig one. For example, after nude\nphotos of several (female) celebrities\nwere leaked a few months ago, users\nset up a subreddit dedicated solely\nto uploading and sharing these\nphotos. The subreddit was banned\neventually, but only due to a flood of\nlegal notices \u2013 not out of any sense\nof decency or empathy for those\naffected.\nIn fact, in a blog post, CEO Yishan\nWong defended his principles by\nsaying \u201cwe consider ourselves not just\na company running a website where\none can post links and discuss them,\nbut the government of a new type of\ncommunity.\u201d Coincidentally, these\nprinciples are the ones where he gets\nto keep the lucrative, coveted images\navailable on his site.\nWong is essentially saying that\npeople should be free to discuss\nanything they believe in a legal\nsense, but also in the sense that\nany viewpoint should have an\nopportunity to reach any audience.\nSo, for example, if bigots want to\ntalk to each other about bigotry, the\nadmins of Reddit don\u2019t see it as their\nresponsibility to step in. If Reddit is a\ngovernment, it\u2019s a libertarian one.\nThey claim no responsibility for the\nsubreddits\u2019 content, but still provide\nthe \u2018real estate\u2019 and association with\nthe known Reddit brand to these\npeople. This leads, worryingly, to\nexamples like the /r/WhiteRights\nsubreddit, with thousands of openly\nracist users.\nThe feminism subreddit, /r/\nfeminism, provides a more\ninteresting example: how was the\nmoderator selected? Simple: someone\nsaw that there was no /r/feminism,\nand registered themselves with the\nadmins as a moderator. That was the\nend of his involvement with the paid,\nofficial Reddit staff. After that he\nhad carte blanche to do anything he\nwanted with the \u201c/r/feminism\u201d brand.\nThis particular moderator is\ncontroversial because he has made\nsome arguably highly anti-feminist\nstatements. So what can feminists\non Reddit do to make the subreddit\na safer space for them? Nothing,\npretty much, which might have\nsurprised them \u2013 it\u2019s easy to be\nfooled into thinking Reddit is more\nadministrated and less user-run than\nit really is.\nOf course, there is some\n\u2018government intervention\u2019. Any\nsubreddit that attracts too much bad\nmedia attention gets banned quickly.\nYou can also get banned for exposing\nthe identity of other Reddit users. So\nthe admins ware happy to intervene,\nbut only when the website traffic is\njeopardised.\nA bigger problem, though, is that\nyou get subreddits that turn into echo\nchambers for some nasty stuff, most\nnotably the infamous /r/TheRedPill.\nIt\u2019s shocking how bad /r/TheRedPill\nis in contrast to the profile and\noverall niceness of so much of Reddit,\nbut what\u2019s more shocking is how\npopular it is \u2013 it claims over 85,000\nusers! Not the biggest subreddit by\na long shot, but not insignificant\neither. What exactly is it?\nNamed for the classic scene in\nThe Matrix where Neo swallows the\n\u2018red pill\u2019 to discover the hidden\ntruth about reality, /r/TheRedPill\nclaims to present its users with the\n\u2018truth\u2019: that feminism was created by\nwomen to control and manipulate\nmen, and that it\u2019s really men who\nare oppressed in our society. It\u2019s\na stupid, demonstrably false idea,\nobviously, but these people take it\ndead seriously.\nJust browsing through the front\npage, threads like \u201cWomen are not\nwhat you expect them to be\u201d, \u201cwomen\nare children\u201d and \u201cthe deregulation\nof the sexual marketplace\u201d (in case\nyou\u2019d forgotten that libertarianism\nobsession of theirs) are the norm.\nThis forum basically conditions men\nto treat women as prizes and to be\nwary of their \u2018tricks\u2019 and deceit.\nLet me be clear: this subreddit isn\u2019t\nan outlier. There\u2019s an even bigger one\ncalled /r/MensRights, which claims\nto be a safe space for men to discuss\nissues affecting them, but seems to\nmostly exist to criticise feminism.\n(Top thread as of writing? \u201cCan We\nTry To Focus on Men\u2019s Rights, not \u201cI\nHate Feminists!\u201d jokes?\u201d)\nThe denizens of these forums\nwill deny it, but it\u2019s actually pretty\nuncontroversial: both of these\nforums are hate groups, no different\nto /r/WhiteRights, and Reddit has\napproved and sanitised them. They\u2019ve\nalso given them the tools they need\nPhoto: cmxhub.com\nTOM RIVLIN\nCOMMENT WRITER\n\"Reddit has a\ndark side, and\nit's a big one.\"\nto communicate, organise, advertise,\nassociate, and persuade, and they\nprofit from doing this. If you like,\nhere\u2019s the Tweet-sized summary: on\nReddit (and our old pal 4chan), hatred\nof women is accepted and in many places\nexpected.\nAgain, I stress, a lot of Reddit isn\u2019t\nlike this. If you just hang out in /r/\nTwitchPlaysPokemon you won\u2019t\nsee any of this. If you really love\ngardening, 95,000 other people do\ntoo! Go hang out on /r/Gardening!\nAnd, of course, people from\nTheRedPill and MensRights will\ndeny accusations of misogyny.\nBut this is precisely Reddit\u2019s\nproblem \u2013 these echo chambers\nwarp the users\u2019 perspective on what\nconstitutes \u2018misogyny\u2019 so much that\nthey don\u2019t see their own hatred. And\nthen, despite the problems they\u2019re\ncausing, Reddit still claims to be\nmainstream and open to all. After all,\nin its slogan it claims to be \u201cthe front\npage of the internet.\u201d\nWith this safe space for misogyny\n(again, 4chan\u2019s role can\u2019t be\nunderstated), is it any surprise\nthat harassing women online has\nbecome so organised? Something like\nGamerGate was inevitable, it just\nneeded a nucleation site like the Zoe\nQuinn accusations. Viewed from this\nperspective, it\u2019s clear that our society\nstill has a long way to go.\nThanks to Joseph Henderson for helping\nme write this by providing many details\nabout how Reddit works.\nTom Rivlin discusses the dark side of the front page of the internet\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11\n05.12.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFor the past week, the town\nof Ferguson, Missouri\nhas been racked with a\ncontinuous stream of protests and\nriots following the Grand Jury\u2019s\ndecision to not indict Officer Darren\nWilson in the case of the shooting\nof Michael Brown. The outcome\nof the investigation has attracted\nwidespread criticism from many\nindividuals within the United States\nand elsewhere in the world.\nFor many however, the dubious\ncircumstances surrounding\nBrown\u2019s death exonerate Wilson\nand undermine the credibility of\nthe protestors. At the core of many\ncritics\u2019 arguments is an attempt\nto turn any debate on its head by\naccusing supporters of the protest of\n\u2018playing the race card\u2019. The argument\nhas been articulated in hundreds of\nways, but the underlying message\nis generally the same: the greatest\nbarriers to a post-racial society are\n\u2018liberals\u2019, who constantly inject race\ninto every issue. As one Fox News\npundit put it: \u201cThe only people who\ntalk about race are racists!\u201d\nThe argument is as asinine as it is\nout of touch: race is a fundamental\ntenet of American politics and\nwill remain so for a long time.\nThe abolition of the \u2018Jim Crow\nLaws\u2019 \u2013 which mandated enforced\nsegregation between the white and\nblack communities \u2013 has not yet\nreached its fiftieth anniversary.\nThere are still individuals alive today\nwho remember being unable to eat in\nthe same restaurants, ride the same\nbuses, or even use the same toilets\nas other ethnicities. For numerous\nothers, the times when white police\nofficers would turn a blind eye to\ncrimes committed against ethnic\nminorities, or when police would\nstop and arrest people from certain\nethnic groups simply because they\ncould, are within living memory. The\nexpectation that ethnic minorities\nshould simply ignore this history\nbecause it is now in the past, is utterly\nabsurd and supremely arrogant.\nUnderstanding our history and the\neffect it has on our society is the first\nstep to avoiding similar events in the\nfuture.\nThe harsh reality is that although\nthe racist behaviours of Jim Crow\nAmerica have truly died out, the\nbrazen bigotry of previous decades\nnow insidiously manifests itself in\na mode of policing which targets\nethnic minorities \u2013 particularly\nAfrican- and Latin-Americans \u2013\nfar more aggressively than other\ncommunities. In New York City,\nblack and Hispanic people are the\ntargets of more than 80% of all stop-and-frisks carried out by the NYPD,\ndespite comprising less than half of\nthe population. Other statistics are\nequally damning: African-Americans\nare typically struck off from juries\nby the prosecution in cases involving\nthose of the same ethnicity, and\ncan expect to serve longer prison\nsentences should they be convicted\nof a crime. In 2010, the United States\nSentencing Commission reported\nthat, on average, a black man will\nreceive a prison sentence 10% longer\nthan what a white man would receive\nfor the same crime. In Alabama,\na 2010 report by the Equal Justice\nInitiative found that eight out of ten\nAfrican-Americans who qualified to\nserve on juries were struck off by the\nprosecution in death-penalty cases.\nIn light of these facts: is it surprising\nthat trust in the justice and law\nenforcement systems is lowest\namongst ethnic minorities?\nFerguson is exemplary in this\nregard: a city in which two-thirds of\nthe population are black, but 94%\nof the civil service and police force\nare white. If you are rich and white,\nmiddle-class and white, or even poor\nand white, then you almost certainly\nhave had little first-hand experience\nof this aggressive profiling, and\ntherefore no real understanding of\nwhy such deep-seated animosity\ntowards police exists among\nminorities; you are out of touch\nfrom the very start. We lambast our\npoliticians for being \u2018out of touch\u2019\nwith the people they are appointed to\ngovern, yet give our law enforcement\na free pass when they are equally\nremoved from the people they seek to\nprotect and serve.\nThis vitriolic, institutionalised\nracism is also compounded by a\nculture of opacity and self-interest\nwhich ultimately jeopardises the\nrole of police officers as impartial\nenforcers of the law. Officers may\nact with impunity, knowing full well\nthat they will enjoy the full backing\nof their municipality, regardless of\nthe nature of their actions.\nThe negative results of this\nimbalance are synergic: a law\nenforcement system which is out of\ntouch with, and openly aggressive\ntowards minorities, and a justice\nsystem which precludes meaningful\ninvestigation into the actions of their\nofficers. The results are shocking:\nIn 2010, police officers in Ferguson\nbeat and hospitalised an innocent\nman, Henry Davis, before proceeding\nto fine him $1,500 in in property\ndamage for \u201cbleeding on their shoes\u201d.\nIt has been tense in Ferguson since the shooting of Michael Brown in August. Photo: ibtimes\nNATHANIEL GALLOP\nCOMMENT WRITER\nWho is accountable for the death of Brown?\n\"The only\npeople who talk\nabout race are\nracists.\"\nDavis promptly filed a suit against\nthe police department, and lost.\nBrown\u2019s shooting is an indirect\nresult of these manifold problems.\nBrown most likely grew up harassed\nby law enforcement, under the\nimpression that the police are not\nthere to help him. His distrust in the\npolice would be solidified through\nincidents such as those experienced\nby Henry Davis. When Brown was\napprehended, his options were\nseemingly clear: to confront Wilson,\nor to surrender. Surrendering would\ngive little chance at any semblance of\nfairness: the balance of probability\nstates that he would be arrested and\nprocessed by white police officers,\ntried by a white judge (and most\nlikely a white jury), and would be\nthrown into prison for far longer\nthan was his due. To confront the\npolice officer may have deadly\nconsequences, but carried the slight\nchance of escaping. It is the epitome\nof a no-win situation.\nWe may never know the\nchoice he made. Ultimately it is\ninconsequential; Michael Brown was\nshot dead. No matter what his choice\nwas, the police and government of\nFerguson must be held accountable\nfor their role in this tragedy.\nNathaniel Gallop discusses at the fallout in Ferguson\n\n"

The\nday began as Philipp Gerstenberg\narrived for his first pint at the\nunion a good eight hours before the\nscheduled departure time. The Tour\nSec was bombarded with questions\non a range of topics using the hashtag\n#AskNav. Despite his ability to keep\ncalm in answering these questions,\nit soon became apparent that he was\nin fact from the Matt Cann school\nof tour secs and that the tradition of\nincompetency was to be carried on.\nRefusing to let this setback hold them\ndown, the army of Rangers powered\non as more and more joined the cause.\nThe touring party arrived in\nBrighton full of high spirits and\noptimism. The squad was split into\nrooms of 20 and 18 with careful\nconsideration to spread the deadwood\nand the fun people equally. After the\nsession at the union and an eventful\ntrain journey, only a brief stop at\nthe local \u2018spoons was required to\nget everyone sufficiently loose and\nwarmed up. The importance of a good\nwarm up was highlighted when a\ncertain Kings\u2019 1st\ns player became the\nfirst casualty of the tour and in the\nprocess made for an uncomfortable\nbus journey for an unsuspecting\nfrench woman. Our first fixture was\nbeing played at a beach-side club\ncalled Coalition. To the surprise of\nmany, the majority of the group\nmanaged to get into the club with\nthe exception of a few. Julian\nNoFuncaponi was deemed ineligible\nto play by British Universities &\nColleges Sport (BUCS) as he had\nconveniently forgotten his ID for the\nentire weekend. Vice-Captain, Robert\nMaizonnier, continuing his ongoing\nstruggle with bouncers all over the\ncountry was also forced to watch\nfrom the stands. The game started\nwith a high tempo and the pace was\ntoo much for Cricket Social Sec and\nself-proclaimed BNOC MattWho?\nKnights as he suffered from a case of\n\u2018Couldn\u2019t hack it with the big boys\u2019.\nThe opposition, University College\nLondon (UCL) Netball, arrived late\nbut were quick to get involved with\nthe play. A cagey period of play\nensued as resident Scouser, Ant\nWilson, peppered the UCL netball\ngoal with some shots but she was\nhaving none of it. With about an hour\non the clock, Dom Wood broke free\nnext to the bar and slotted in a neat\nfinish to open the scoring. Vicious\nrumours circulated that he also\nagreed on a return leg in London with\nthe opposition. Club wonder kid, Sam\nWest Brom, was having a torrid time\nin Brighton and there was no respite\nfrom the opposition. Having heard\nof his academy past, he was double\nman marked out of the game all the\nway back to the hostels. Despite the\nbest efforts of the rest of the squad he\ncouldn\u2019t break past the double man\nmarking and the opposition managed\nto register two goals. IC looked to be\nheading to defeat until Edin Dzeko\nsnuck in with an equaliser late on as\nthe points were shared. Other notable\nincidents in the game were Naven\nGhulam receiving Red for a two\nfooted challenge to the head as well\nICUAFC go on tour to Brighton\u2019s beachside\nclubs... And play some football as well\nSeb Gosden collecting his first ever\nsending off for giving chat-back to\nthe referee. Bazzledon insisted he had\nscored a winner in the disable toilets\nbut his claims were denied to due to\nthe use of a 4-1-4-1 formation and a\nscandalous self pleasuring technique.\nSecond day of tour began slowly\nwith the prospect of actual football\nto be played. Nav still serving his ban\non the touchlines meant the group\nwas without their tour sec yet again.\nWe arrived at the pitch to see what\ncan only be described as a poor man\u2019s\nHyde Park football pitch with the\nadded feature of actual human faeces.\nExpert storyteller, Charlie Powell, had\nwarned the troops of the potentially\ndeadly effects of getting shit in the\nwound and players on both teams\nstarted the game with caution. IC\nskins were captained by tour enigma,\nAlcoholic Frank while IC shirts were\ncaptained by 3 out of 4 Patel brothers,\nKieran, Beeran and Peeran. (Come\nto the union to meet all three on any\ngiven Wednesday or Saturday). Both\nteams produced a display worthy of\nthe pitch. A scorpion kick goal from\nDickon Dent Duffield was a highlight\nwhilst Charlie bagged a hat-trick only\nto be disallowed due to lack of goal\nconversion via Klinsmann. After the\ngame, both teams were treated to an\nexhibition of textbook Klinsmanns\nby Shagger Harris, which everyone\nappreciated. Final score was a 1-0 win\nto Brighton football pitches and Man\nPhoto: ICUAFC\nTaha Butt on the action from the coast\nof The Match was Peeran Patel for\nbeing peer pressured into learning\nhow to kick.\nWith football out of the way there\nwas just enough time for a visit to\nanother dubiously named night\nclub. This time it was the beach side\nestablishment of Shoosh that would\nplay host. IC had a lengthy warm\nup at \u2018spoons where we got told off\nfor having too much fun and being\n\u201ctoo intoxed\u201d. Not affected by this\nearly setback IC arrived at the venue\nwith high hopes. Unfortunately the\nopposition set out for a draw and the\npoints were shared. Highlight of the\ngame was another late challenge, this\ntime on Bronia\u2019s brother Callum,\neven though he wasn\u2019t even playing.\nCallum was subbed off bringing an\nend to his Brighton adventure.\nNext morning, the only thing\non the agenda was to make a quick\ngetaway and get back to London as\nsoon as possible. Despite a quality\nweekend, it was agreed that Brighton\nwould never be revisited. Thank\nyou Naven Ghulam for organising\nanother fantastic ICUAFC tour.\nPhoto: ICUAFC\nPhoto: ICUAFC\n\n"

Disclaimer: has nothing to do with real\nyo-yos. Photo: Wikimedia Commons\nChrysostomos Meli looks at how you will be paying for things in the future\nMillions injured in worst Friday since Rebecca Black\nJamie Dutton\nSECTION EDITOR\nSilicon Valley has for some time\nnow declared an all-out war\non our non-electronic habits,\nchanging them to fit around their\ntechnology. It has been a gradual\nprocess but thinking about it, we\ncertainly don\u2019t read books the way\nwe used to. Writing an essay barely\ninvolves a pen anymore, we can\ngo grocery shopping without even\nleaving the house and our fitness\nregime is becoming a lot more\ninformative. It now seems tech\ncompanies have got their eyes set on\nthe way we pay.\nCompanies like Paypal have, for\nmore than ten years now, been\nhelping us buy things online. They\u2019re\nmaking financial transactions from\nour own bank account to someone\nelse\u2019s that much easier. But that isn\u2019t\ngood enough anymore. Real world\ntransactions should and will become\nas easy and painless. Why should\nwe carry those heavy wallets in one\npocket when we all have sophisticated\nelectronic devices in the other?\nPaying with your phone is\ndefinitely not something we are that\nused to in the UK but for last few\nyears, the USA has been inundated\nwith different apps that can act\nas credit card holders. The most\ninteresting one is Google Wallet - an\napp anyone can download on their\nAndroid phone. The premise is very\nsimple - add your card credentials and\nthen proceed to the register, paying\nwirelessly using your phone\u2019s NFC.\nBut Google Wallet hasn\u2019t lived up to\nexpectations. Debates over credit card\nfees seem to be the prevailing reason,\nbut as Apple found out last month,\nbig retailers such as Walmart have\ntheir own services, which they need\nto push.\nApple finally decided to join the\nfray with Apple Pay, and everyone\nis hoping that it will be the publicity\nthe technology needs to finally go\nmainstream. The service is available\nonly on the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, the new\niPads and the Apple Watch when\nit\u2019s released. Although the service\nhas been out for just a little over a\nmonth there haven\u2019t been any major\ncomplaints, but we won\u2019t find out\nabout usage statistics until Apple\u2019s\nnext financial quarter announcement.\nGoogle and Apple are not providing\nthese services for anyone outside the\nUSA yet - they want to get it right\nbefore it goes global. The USA is\nknown for its high consumerism and\nthese companies couldn\u2019t ask for a\nbetter testing ground. What\u2019s more,\nintroducing a new payment system in\na country with a whole new currency,\nbanking system and consumer\nbehavior will prove more difficult.\nThat leaves the UK an open playing\nfield for anyone who wants to try. A\nserious contender is YOYO, a product\nof our very own Imperial Create Lab\nthat has raised \u00a33.1 million in seed\nfunding from investment groups\nsuch as Telefonica and Firestartr. It is\none of Europe\u2019s largest seed funding\nrounds this year.\nYOYO is an app which, unlike Apple\nPay and Google Wallet, doesn\u2019t allow\nyou to pay directly through your\ncredit card. An account is set up once\nyou download the app and you use\nyour card credentials to add funds\nto your account. Once you reach the\nregister, the funds used are in the app,\nnot in your bank account. Although\nthis means that you have to top-up\nyour account every time it runs out,\nit is a fairly painless process. What\nmakes YOYO attractive to users is its\nvoucher integration. Every time you\nspend money at a particular retailer\nYOYO remembers and, if for every\n9 coffees you get one for free, YOYO\nwill display the voucher for you to use\nthe next time you\u2019re at the shop.\nAnother fundamental difference is\nthe use of the registered laser scanner\nto make the transaction; scanning\na QR code instead of tapping your\nphone using NFC. Once the code is\nscanned, the funds are immediately\nremoved from your account\ndisplaying your total and actual\namount at all times. This give YOYO\nthe advantage that it can be installed\non any smartphone device running\nHorror at Currys PC World\nWorkington branch as\nmillions of people flocked to\nthe store to pick up excellent deals\non the best and latest technology,\nranging from 2.5mm microphone\ncables to ruby-encrusted vibrators.\nThe opening was just like any day\nbut the first people to arrive were\nliterally confounded by the excellent\ndeals such as \u201cbuy-one-for-theprice-of-two\u201d and \u201c80% off (500% of\noriginal value)!!!\u201d\nSmiles of joy however were\ntransformed into pouts of\nindifference as the customers found\nthey had to wait six years to be served\nin the queue.\nDespite this, many thought it\nwas worth the time and spread the\nword on social media. The whole of\nmainland Britain drove as fast as they\ncould to get the best deals. It was even\nrumoured that some people from\nNorthern Ireland were so desperate\nto cash in on such great savings that\nthey swam across the Irish Sea. It\nwas the biggest stampede the North\nhad seen since the opening the first\nGreggs bakery in 1939 and many were\ninjured as a consequence.\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad news, however.\nThe government smiled at how\nwell the public adapted to such\nAmericanisation and announced\nplans to abolish the NHS and raise\nuniversity tuition fees to \u00a3100,000\nper year to complete the United\nKingdom\u2019s transformation to the 51st\nstate of the USA.\nThe British public, many who\nhave been writing frantically to\ntheir local MP asking when carrying\na gun will be legal and when\n\u2018Disneyworld Lincolnshire\u2019 will be\nbuilt, have unanimously accepted\nthis transformation and cannot wait\nto sing The Star-Spangled Banner at\ntheir child\u2019s next baseball game.\niOS or Android even the ones without\nNFC, which encompasses every iOS\nuser who hasn\u2019t upgraded to iPhone\n6 yet.\nThe app also offers a platform for\nstore owners to collect and display the\ndata they need to run their business\nmore efficiently- data that would\notherwise be impossible to collect. A\nsimilar service is provided by Square\nInc. - a Silicon Valley startup recently\nvalued at $6 billion. It should be noted\nalthough Square\u2019s business platform\n\u2018Square Register\u2019 has seen wide\nsuccess, their payment app \u2018Square\nWallet\u2019 has been recently pulled from\nboth the Android and iOS app stores\ndue to lack of interest.\nYOYO for the time being is using a\npage right out of Facebook\u2019s playbook\nand is expanding their user base;\njumping from one campus to the\nnext. It\u2019s a move they believe will\neventually bring in retailers, which\nany payments service desperately\nrequires in order to succeed.\nPayment systems are very much in\ntheir infancy, especially in the UK.\nHowever, startups like YOYO are\nmaking real headway. It is very early\nto call but the sky is the limit and\nYOYO\u2019s recent deal with Snapchat to\nprovide a money transfer service is\nvery much a testament to that.\nArtist's impression of scene at Currys Worthington Source: youtube.com\n\n"

Silicon has\nbecome very cheap now: well over\nhalf the price of a rooftop system is\ninstallation. The other problem that\nplastic has is that it doesn\u2019t last as\nlong as conventional PV systems.\nThe Chinese intervention is great\nnews for first generation silicon\ncells, as it has driven down the costs\nenormously, but bad news for my\ncompany and for plastic electronics.\nAlthough we had efficiency, our\ninvestors decided to sell us to an\nAmerican conglomerate, because we\njust couldn\u2019t produce the technology\ncheaply enough to compete with the\nChinese.\nDo you think that using\nsunlight to produce fuels has a\ncomplementary role alongside\nother photovoltaic technologies?\nWe\u2019ve seen already that electric\ncars can be powered by silicon\nphotovoltaics: there\u2019s enough\nsunlight to power a car for an average\ndomestic mileage.\nBut that means the car can only be\nused when the sun is shining.\nWhat you really want to be able to\ndo is store that much energy from\nhighly efficient photovoltaics on the\nroof of your house that match the\nelectricity needs of your house, plus\nsome extra to power a car.\nThe obvious way to store it is as\nfuel.\nThere\u2019s enough sunlight hitting\na rooftop to capture carbon dioxide\nand turn it into methanol. Hydrogen\nis easier to make, and buses run on\nit already, but I think for home use,\nmethanol would be better because it\u2019s\nsafer.\nThe American Physical Society\nthinks it can\u2019t be done, but I refute\ntheir pessimism. Firstly: nature does\nit pretty well. Plants do it to make\nsugars with about 2% efficiency, but\nI think it should be possible to do it\nbetter, as there are lots of physicists\nand engineers looking into exactly\nthis.\nThere\u2019s a group at ETH Zurich\nworking on nanostructure filters.\nThey take in carbon dioxide through\nthe filter at room temperature and\nheat it up to 90\u00b0; this then desorbs\nthe CO2 letting you store it at\nconcentrations up to 99% . In the\nnext couple of years, we\u2019ll be able\nto use this technology to produce\nmethanol with CO2 straight from the\natmosphere.\nChemical engineers are working on\nan electrochemical cell, which uses\nphotons to produce hydrogen. You\ncan do it easily by shining light on\ncatalysts to speed up the reaction.\nIf we could produce our own, free,\nsolar fuel on our rooftops, we could\nuse it to power cars. You\u2019d have free\nmileage for life.\nIs solar power really reliable\nenough to use as our main energy\nsource?\nThe Germans did a very important\nexperiment in 2007 called\nKombikraftwerk. It took the\nequivalent electricity demand of a\nsmall town and met 100% of it with\nrenewables at all times. It showed\nthat over a year, 70% of German\ndemand could be met by wind and\nphotovoltaics, with 25% from biogas\nand only 5% from storage.\nThe output from nuclear power\nstations has to remain constant: day,\nnight, summer, winter.\nAs I discuss in my book, wind\npower output in the UK is, on average,\nmuch higher than in Germany. If\nthe test were run here, around 78% of\ndemand could be supplied from wind\nand photovoltaics.\nThere\u2019s also another very\nimportant point against nuclear\npower.\nOffshore wind and PV are rising\nfaster than mobile phones did when\nthey first took off. If you extrapolate\nit, we could have far more PV and\noffshore wind than nuclear by the\ntime the new Hinckley Point turns\non. If we do what we can do with PV\nand wind, nuclear will be a complete\nirrelevance, but only if we invest in\nsubsidies for renewable rather than\nnuclear.\nDoes your house have\nphotovoltaics?\nYes! I\u2019m extremely pleased with them.\nThis point about what happens when\nthe sun doesn\u2019t shine: our excess\n(and we often have it) is stored in our\nhot water tank. Between March and\nOctober, we don\u2019t use gas: all or hot\nwater comes from excess solar. So the\nmessage that you will sometimes hear\nthat we can\u2019t store solar energy except\nat great expense is completely wrong.\nAnother point is that we have it\non an East-West side. It generates as\nmuch as if it were ideally positioned\non a south facing roof. We\u2019re actually\nsaving even more on our electricity\nbill, because the sun is shining more\noften when we\u2019re using it.\nIn the future, concentrated\nphotovoltaics could track the sun\nthroughout the day, so you always get\nthe maximum light intensity on the\nsolar panels. I calculated that using\nconcentrators with high efficiency\ncells, we could generate around 90%\nmore energy over the year.\nI\u2019ve also signed up to Good Energy,\nan all-renewable electricity supplier.\nAll our excess power goes back to the\ngrid, which I can borrow back later.\nIf you can\u2019t get a rooftop system,\nswitching to Good Energy is a good\nthing to do.\n\"It's the\nsimplest\nproblem in\nquantum\nmechanics\nand here's\na practical\napplication\nof it.\"\n\"Offshore\nwind and solar cells are\nrising faster\nthan mobile\nphones did\nwhen they\nfirst took\noff.\"\nKeith Barnham\u2019s book \u201cThe\nBurning Answer: A User\u2019s Guide\nto the Solar Revolution\u201d, is\npublished by Orion, RRP \u00a322.50\nWill solar panels like this be on all our houses in the future?

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 33\n05.12.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn 1613, Elizabeth Tanfield Cary\npublished The Tragedy of Mariam,\nthe Fair Queen of Jewry. Taking its\ncue from Roman drama, it is a classic\nexample of a Jacobean revenge drama,\na tale of love, betrayal and murder.\nThe play centres around Mariam,\nsecond wife of Herod the Great; at\nthe beginning of the piece, Mariam\nbelieves her husband is dead, killed\nat the hand of Octavian. However,\nHerod returns, and his sister, Salome,\nmanages to convince him that\nMariam has been unfaithful in his\nabsence. As punishment, Mariam is\nexecuted. What makes The Tragedy of\nMariam special, unique even, is that it\nwas the first play written by a woman.\nThis week, more than 400 years\nafter Mariam was published, sees\nthe opening of a new production of\nRebecca Lenkiewicz\u2019s play Her Naked\nSkin at Guildhall School of Music &\nDrama. The play, which was written\nin 2008, is set in the years preceding\nWWI, and describes the campaign\nfor equal voting rights by the WSPU\n\u2013 more commonly known as the\nSuffragettes. Both of the plays use\nthe past as a way of questioning the\nsocietal values of today, particularly\nthose relating to women: Cary uses\nthe idea of the Greek chorus to\nrepresent the patriarchal values of\nthe day, allowing her to question\ntheir value; Lenkiewicz presents the\nlessons learned from the Suffragettes\nin a dramatic manner, thereby\nhighlighting how things have\nchanged since then. But how have\ntimes changed? Surely today, more\nthan four centuries after Cary first set\nout to defy convention, things have\nimproved for women in the theatre?\nSadly, they appear to have not.\nLenkiewicz\u2019 play, although very well\nreceived on its original run in 2008, it\nachieved more publicity for being the\nfirst original play written by a woman\nto be staged on the main stage at The\nNational Theatre. That\u2019s right. 2008.\nThe National Theatre, held by many\nto be the finest tribute to theatre in\nBritain, if not the world, did not put\non an original production written by\na woman until a little over 5 years\nago. This fact in itself is, for me,\nshocking, but if we expand our gaze,\nlooking out further afield and back in\ntime, the picture we paint for women\nin the theatre is grim indeed.\nLet\u2019s start with the National\nTheatre, which recently celebrated its\n50th\nanniversary, and is perhaps the\nbest-known theatre in the country.\nSurely, if British women playwrights\nare to have a place to call home, it\nwould be here? Unfortunately not: in\nthe first ten years of director Nicholas\nHytner\u2019s tenure - from April 2003\nto April 2013 - the NT put on 206\nfull scale productions, of which a\npaltry 20 were written by women, less\nthan 10%. Other theatres fare much\nbetter, with the Almeida, Hampstead,\nSoho, and Bush Theatres averaging\n30% of their output being written by\nwomen, but this is far from ideal. In\nfact, the only theatre that comes close\nto reaching a balance is The Royal\nCourt, whose output is 41% written\nby women, although perhaps this is\nto be expected, since the company\nchampion new and eclectic writing.\nRecent estimates suggest that on the\nwhole, only around 17% of produced\nplays have been written by women.\nSo why is there this disparity?\nSome blame the Western Canon,\nthe collection of works regarded as\n\u2018The Best\u2019, from whose vaulted halls\nmany women throughout history\nhave been denied entry. While there\nis an argument \u2013 a strong one \u2013 to be\nmade that the Canon marginalises\nany writers who aren\u2019t white men, the\nworld of theatre\u2019s reliance on such\nwork would almost certainly distort\nthe types of plays being put on. With\na rich history of Ibsen, Strindberg,\nand Chekhov to choose from, there\nis little incentive for theatres to\nattempt to take a chance on newer\nworks. But recent productions\nHer Naked Skin & the Legacy of Women Writers\nFred Fyles asks the theatre industry where the women playwrights are\nhave shown that introducing more\nwomen onto the boards can have\nwide reaching benefits for the\nwhole cultural landscape: Phyllida\nLloyd\u2019s all-women production of\nHenry IV recently finished its run\nat the Donmar Warehouse to rave\nreviews, while the Royal Shakespeare\nCompany \u2013 which would have\nperhaps the most legitimate excuse\nfor ignoring women out of all theatre\ncompanies - is making active steps to\nbring a more balanced view to their\noutput, adapting two of Booker Prize\nwinner Hilary Mantel\u2019s works for the\nstage. In this respect, the National\nTheatre in particular is dragging its\nfeet: only 18% of their new plays were\nwritten by women.\nBut perhaps those plays written\nby women are just not as good as\nthose by men? Such an argument,\nwhich seems to revel in the idea of\nthe solitary male genius, simply does\nnot hold water. One only has to look\nat the current state of theatreland\nto realise that a majority of the best\nplays in the last few years have been\nwritten by women: Lucy Prebble\u2019s\nEnron, which fused music and high\ndrama to tell the tale of the corrupt\nUS energy giant, ran for nearly a year\nin the West End, picking up gushing\ncritical reviews with ease; Laura\nWade\u2019s Posh, which premiered at\nThe Royal Court, has recently been\nmade into a film, The Riot Club, for\nwhich Wade wrote the screenplay;\nand Chimerica, written by Lucy\nKirkwood, was perhaps judges as the\nCharlie Bate, Rebecca Lee, Amber James, Alice Winslow, Lily Sacofsky, Elaine Fellos, and Emily-Celine Thomson\nin Her Naked Skin Photo: Clive Barda\nplay of 2013, garnering multiple\naward nominations during its West\nEnd run.\nAnd it\u2019s not just in the UK: Harvard\neconomist Emily Glassberg Sands\nresearched gender disparity on\nBroadway, and found that works\nwritten by women were on average\n18% more profitable, and yet ran for\nthe same amount of time as those\nwritten by men, adding weight to the\nidea that women simply have to be\nbetter in order to achieve the same\nas men. Sands also sent out identical\nscripts to multiple theatre companies,\ngiving half a women author and half a\nmale author; she found that the work\nwritten by \u2018women\u2019 was judged to be\nof lesser quality, and likely to make\nless money.\nTimes certainly may have changed\nsince the days of Mariam, but the\nBritish world of theatre remains\nhostile to women: they can tread their\nboards, they can even direct their\nplays, but they cannot write their\nscripts. The UK in particular has a\nrich tradition of women writers, from\nJane Lumley, who in the 16th Century\nbecame the first person to translate\nEuripides, to modern writers such as\nAbi Morgan and Caryl Churchill, and\nit therefore is so tragic for their work\nto remain unrecognised. History is,\nas they say, written by the victors, but\nfor most of our history women have\nbeen banished from the paper, they\nhave been robbed of the pen.\nHer Naked Skin ran at Guildhall\nSchool of Music & Drama last week.\nRebecca Lee and Oscar Batterham in Her Naked Skin Photo: Clive Barda\n\n"

It is expected that\nthe funding will allow an extra 10,000\nstudents to pursue a master\u2019s degree,\nalthough the loan is only available to\nstudents under the age of 30.\nThe total cost for the loan over the\nfirst four years is \u00a31.5 billion, and\nthe loan will have an interest rate,\nrepayable at 9% of earnings above\n\u00a321,000. The loans will be available\nacross all subject types, not just for\nscience, technology, engineering\nand medicine degrees as has been\npreviously suggested in government.\nThe treasury has cited an increased\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\ndemand for high-skilled labour and\nan increase in social mobility as\nreasons for the introduction of the\nloan, but also expect that those who\ntake out the loan will be making\nenough money after completing the\ndegree to pay it back.\n\u201cThe loans are designed so that,\non average, individuals will repay\nin full, in recognition of the high\nprivate return to individuals, but\nthey will beat commercial rates. The\ngovernment will consult on the detail\nand will confirm the delivery plan,\u201d\nthe Treasury says.\nMr Osborne said in statement in\nthe House of Commons: \u201cA year\nago, I abolished the arbitrary cap on\nthe total number of undergraduates\nat our universities. Today, I am\ngoing to revolutionise the support\nfor our postgraduate students too.\nUntil now there has been almost no\nfinancial support available, and the\nupfront costs of postgraduate degrees\ndeter bright students from poorer\nbackgrounds.\n\u201cSo today, across all disciplines,\nwe will make government-backed\nstudent loans of up to \u00a310,000\navailable, for the first time ever, to all\nyoung people undertaking postgrad\nmaster\u2019s degrees.\u201d\nHowever, there may be a downside\nto the loans.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has\nassessed that the loans may result\npeople losing 50% upwards of their\nsalary to cover total repayments when\nalso considering income tax, national\ninsurance costs and undergraduate\nrepayments too.\nThe loans have been designed\nto ensure that, on average, they\nwill be paid back in full alongside\nundergraduate loan repayments,\ncompared to the undergraduate loan\nwhich only one in two students will\npay back in full.\nPreviously, costs for postgraduate\ncourses have had to be covered by\nCareer Development Loans, savings\nor scholarships.\nCDLs only allow you to borrow up\nto \u00a310,000 so often cannot cover both\nthe living costs and the tuition costs\nfor postgraduate study and have to be\npaid back regardless of employment\nstatus after graduation, making them\na high-risk payment option.

Well, step forward Space\nEngine. It has been in the works\nsince 2005 and is the beautiful\nand complex brainchild of Russian\nastronomer and programmer\nVladimir Romanyuk.\nThe concept of the software\nis that you can go to wherever\nyou want in space and explore\nplanets, moons, stars, nebulae,\nother galaxies and more without\nthe need for the most expensive\nastronomical imaging equipment.\nAll observed astronomical objects\nare implemented; even the most\nrecently discovered distant stars\nand exoplanets. But it doesn\u2019t stop\nthere. Instead of an invisible wall\nultimately set by the limitations of\nour current technology, it randomly\ngenerates objects meaning that there\nare literally billions of galaxies to be\nexplored; each containing trillions\nof star systems and thus even more\nplanets and moons.\nHowever, Space Engine isn\u2019t just\nabout objects just whizzing about\nin space. You can travel at any\nspeed through space and time. This\nmeans, for example, you can watch\nthe sunrise (or lack thereof) at any\npoint on any planet. Each body\nhas its own in-game wiki telling\nyou almost everything you need\nabout it. Using this data it can\nthen simulate whether the planet\n(or moon) is suitable for life, be it\norganic or some unknown exotic\nvariety. This is the most enjoyable\naspect of the software for me; you\ncan click on any star in the sky, fly\nover to it in seconds and explore\nits planets. It tells you whether\nthese planets harbour life \u2013 from\nsimple floaters on gas giants to\ncomplex multicellular beings on\nsome unlikely candidate hosts. You\ncan then go and see what the planet\nlooks like on the surface. Some are\ndeserts, some are ocean planets and\nsome are rocky and very earth-like.\nIt is just fascinating to potter around\nthese unique environments and see\nwhat life could be like elsewhere.\nOn the subject of uniqueness,\ndespite looking through hundreds of\nplanets so far I have not found two\nthat look the same. Most planets are\ngas giants of course, but even they\ncome in different colours and in\ndifferent sizes. I\u2019ve seen Earth-like\nbodies with beautiful pink clouds,\nsome with many, many moons\nand even a moon harbouring life\nwith a Saturn-like ring system (see\npicture). Even though the absolute\nmajority of these systems are just\nrandomly generated simulations,\nthere is something very satisfying\nabout just browsing star systems and\nfinding your own relic of a planet\n\u2013 something someone hasn\u2019t found\nbefore.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg\nof the capabilities of Space Engine.\nBeing free to move in time means\none can observe the configuration\nof star systems at any point. This\nis fortuitously very useful to me in\nmy masters project this year. Whilst\nobserving the magnetic field around\nSaturn, it has proved very useful to\nknow where its moons are relative\nto the Cassini probe which is doing\nthe measuring. This software allows\nme to type in the desired time and\nit will instantly depict what the\nuniverse looked like at that point to\nthe nearest hundredth of a second.\nI would go as far to say that Space\nEngine is probably the best piece of\nsoftware that you\u2019ve probably not\nheard of. Although technically not\na game, I still think that this would\nappeal to most people (especially\nImperial students!). It is in beta\nstage right now and is thus free to\ndownload from en.spaceengine.org.\nIf you enjoy it and want to help it\ncarry on there is a link to donate.\nIf you\u2019re computer has a semi-decent graphics card (or failing that\nit is possible to install on university\ncomputers\u2026 I checked), download\nSpace Engine now and lose yourself\nin the universe which we call home.\nMAXIMILIAN EGGL\nGAMES EDITOR\nYep, you can also go down to planets' surfaces and feast upon the beauty!! Photo: Space Engine, Jamie Dutton\nSteam Greenlight\nof the week\nFlying is one of the things that\nis absolutely amazing, but is rarely\nsuccessfully realized in games.\nHowever, in Air Brawl we have\nwhat looks like a good attempt.\nThis multiplayer title has a heave\nfocus on dogfighting on tight,\nmazey maps.

In the last\nsixty-four, the standard of play was\nmuch better and both Linus and\nAaron were defeated in extremely\ntight matches, with Aaron playing a\nsloppy frame to hand his opponent\nvictory. However, Charles was making\na great first impression on his debut\nuniversity pool tournament and\nsteamed through to the next round\nwith some unbelievable play and\na touch of alcohol induced luck. A\nwinner\u2019s medal was not to be though,\nas in the next round he faced a very\nhandy player from Southampton\nwho had previously dispatched the\nSnooker and Pool win irst medal in Shield\n3rd\nseed for the tournament. With his\nopponent blatantly stealing Charlie\u2019s\npatented \u201cdrink between the shots\u201d\nmethod, the dye was cast and Chaz\nwas sent packing. However, he can\nhold his head high with an excellent\ndebut performance.\nNext up was the team event, with\nour group made up of UCL 1st\ns,\nOxford 2nd\ns and University of East\nAnglia 3rd\ns. First up was Oxford,\nand after racing into a 4-0 lead with\nsome fine play from Aaron playing\nat number 1 and Charles at number\n3, we were pegged back to 5-4 to set\nup a tense final\u00e9. Captain Rob finally\n(in his second outing) showed some\nmettle and took the winning frame\nto give us a 6-4 win and a great start\nto the tournament. Next up were\nUEA 3rd\ns, and a much less dramatic\nmatch ended with us as runaway 6-1\nwinners, with Aaron the only player\nin the team winning every frame\nso far, something he frequently\nmentioned to his teammates to help\ntheir spirits. With play over for the\nday, the team played some friendly\nAaron Brown and Robert Hughes report as Snooker and Pool win their irst\nmedal at the Southern England Championships\nframes with other universities and\nmade excellent use of the cider and\nGuinness stocked bar to let off some\nsteam.\nSunday arrived, and the team made\nits way to the tables for a London\nshowdown of epic proportions.\nWith the last UCL \u2013 Imperial match\nending at 6-1 to us, UCL were out for\nrevenge. Charles and Aaron were up\nfirst, and after Charles lost a very\ntight game (against a player who\nfinished 4th\nin the overall singles\ntournament), Aaron brought it back.\n1-1. Linus followed, and another\ntight frame went UCLs way. 2-1. Each\nteam continued to trade frames until\nUCL took the advantage when they\nmanaged to inflict a first loss on\nthe \u201cmighty\u201d (to use his own words)\nAaron, a \u201cmassive\u201d (again his words)\nblow. 5-3 was the score with both\nRob and Cheng needing to win their\nframes to avoid defeat.\nIt was not to be, and UCL managed\nto convert their lead to a 6-3 win,\nmeaning that after starting the day\nas top of the group, Imperial dropped\nto 3rd\nplace based on frames conceded\nand head-to-head. This meant that\nwe qualified for the Team shield\nevent, and our next match was against\nSouthampton 2nd\ns, a very worthy\nopponent. Another no nonsense\nperformance from the team and we\nfinished 6-3 winners, with Rob tying\nup the match with a simple (although\nhe strongly claims it wasn\u2019t) black.\nThe semi-final was upon us, and\nwith it came a very winnable match\nagainst Essex 2nds. A shocking\nstart to the match, which saw both\nthe dependable Aaron and Linus\nthrow away their frames and\nEssex race into a 2-0 lead. Rob and\nCharles then brought it back with\nsome tidy play and we were right\nback in it at 2-2. Unfortunately\nthe team then fell apart, with easy\nframes slipping through our fingers\nand we eventually lost 6-3. While\ndisappointed not to reach the final,\nthe entire team can hold their heads\nup as they bring home the first\nImperial pool team medals of the\nseason (and ever).\nPhoto: IC Snooker and Pool\n\n"

Doesn\u2019t\ncount.I have to say that it was a\nlovely situation to submit grant\napplications for your own survival\nwith such a deadline.We all know\nwhat a lottery grant applications are.\nThere was talk that the Department\nhad accepted to be in dept for some\ntime and would compensate this\nthrough more teaching.So I thought\nStefan Grimm\u2019s email, taken from dcscience.net:\nthat I would survive.But the email\nbelow indicates otherwise.I got\nthis after the student for whom I\n\u201chave plans\u201dreceived the oficial\nadmission to the College as a PhD\nstudent.He waited so long to work\nin our group and I will never be able\nto tell him that this should now\nnot happen.What these guys don\u2019t\nknow is that they destroy lives.Well,\nthey certainly destroyed mine.\nThe reality is that these career\nscientists up in the hierarchy of this\norganization only look at igures\nto judge their colleagues,be it\nimpact factors or grant income.\nAfter all,how can you convince\nyour Department head that you\nare working on something exciting\nif he not even attends the regular\nDepartmental seminars? The aim is\nonly to keep up the inances of their\nDepartments for their own career\nadvancement.\nThese formidable leaders are\nplaying an interesting game:\nThey hire scientists from other\ncountries to submit the work that\nthey did abroad under completely\ndifferent conditions for the Research\nAssessment that is supposed to\ngauge the performance of British\nuniversities.Afterwards they leave\nthem alone to either perform\nwith grants or being kicked out.\nEven if your work is submitted to\nthis Research Assessment and\nbrings in money for the university,\nyou are targeted if your grant\nincome is deemed insuficient.\nThose submitted to the research\nassessment hence support those\ncolleagues who are unproductive\nbut have grants.Grant income is\nall that counts here,not scientiic\noutput.\nWe had four papers with original\ndata this year so far,in Cell Death\nand Differentiation,Oncogene,\nJournal of Cell Science and,as I\ninformed Prof Wilkins this week,\none accepted with the EMBO\nJournal.I was also the editor of a\nbook and wrote two reviews.Doesn\u2019t\ncount.\nThis leads to a interesting spin to the\nold saying\u201cpublish or perish\u201d.Here it\nis\u201cpublish and perish\u201d.\nDid I regret coming to this place?\nI enormously enjoyed interacting\nwith my science colleagues here,\nbut like many of them,I fell into the\ntrap of confusing the reputation of\nscience here with the present reality.\nThis is not a university anymore but\na business with very few up in the\nhierarchy,like our formidable duo,\nproiteering and the rest of us are\nmilked for money,be it professors\nfor their grant income or students\nwho pay 100.-pounds just to extend\ntheir write-up status.\nIf anyone believes that I feel what\nmy excellent coworkers and I have\naccomplished here over the years\nis inferior to other work,is wrong.\nWith our apoptosis genes and the\nconcept of Anticancer Genes we\nhave developed something that\nis probably much more exciting\nthan most other projects,including\nthose that are heavily supported\nby grants.\nWas I perhaps too lazy? My boss\nsmugly told me that I was actually\nthe one professor on the whole\ncampus who had submitted\nthe highest number of grant\napplications.Well,they were\nprobably simply not good enough.\nI am by far not the only one who\nis targeted by those formidable\nguys.These colleagues only keep\nquiet out of shame about their\nsituation.Which is wrong.As we\nall know hitting the sweet spot in\nbioscience is simply a matter of\nluck,both for grant applications\nand publications.\nWhy does a Professor have to be\ntreated like that?\nOne of my colleagues here at the\nCollege whom I told my story\nlooked at me,there was a silence,\nand then said:\u201cYes,they treat us\nlike sh*t\u201d.\nBest regards\nStefan Grimm\nDate: 10 March 2014\nDear Stefan\nI am writing following our recent\nmeetings in which we discussed\nyour current grant support and the\nprospects for the immediate future.\nThe last was our discussion around\nyour PRDP,which I have attached.\nAs we discussed,any signiicant\nexternal funding you had has now\nended.I know that you have been\nseeking further funding support\nwith Charities such as CRUK and\nthe EU commission but my concern\nis that despite submitting many\ngrants,you have been unsuccessful\nin persuading peer-review panels\nthat you have a competitive\napplication.\nYour dedication to seek funding is\nnot in doubt but as time goes by,\nthis can risk becoming a dificult\nsituation from which to extricate\noneself.In other words,grant\ncommittees can become fatigued\nfrom seeing a series of unsuccessful\napplications from the same\napplicant.\nI am of the opinion that you\nare struggling to fulil the\nmetrics of a Professorial post at\nImperial College which include\nmaintaining established funding\nin a programme of research with\nan attributable share of research\nspend of \u00a3200k p.a and must now\nstart to give serious consideration\nas to whether you are performing at\nthe expected level of a Professor at\nImperial College.\nOver the course of the next 12\nmonths I expect you to apply and\nbe awarded a programme grant as\nlead PI.This is the objective that\nyou will need to achieve in order for\nyour performance to be considered\nat an acceptable standard.I am\nWilkin\u2019s email to Stefan Grimm, as taken from THE\nOn page 6, read what Academic peers had to say of the emails\ncommitted to doing what I can to\nhelp you succeed and will meet\nwith you monthly to discuss your\nprogression and success in achieving\nthe objective outlined. You have\npreviously initiated discussions\nin our meetings regarding\nopportunities outside of Imperial\nCollege and I know you have been\nexploring opportunities elsewhere.\nShould this be the direction you\nwish to pursue,then I will do what I\ncan to help you succeed.\nPlease be aware that this constitutes\nthe start of informal action in\nrelation to your performance,\nhowever should you fail to meet\nthe objective outlined,I will need\nto consider your performance in\naccordance with the formal College\nprocedure for managing issues of\npoor performance (Ordinance D8)\nwhich can be found at the following\nlink.http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/\nsecretariat/collegegovernance/\nprovisions/ordinances/d8\nShould you have any questions on\nthe above,please do get in touch.\nBest wishes\nMartin\n\n"

    "content": "12 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n05.12.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOne question commonly\nasked of economists is \u201cas a\nmember of the public, what\nexactly does the economy have to\ndo with me?\u201d People often feel that\nas individuals, they are fighting\npersonal battles against household\nbills or focusing on their own\nconsumption, rather than being part\nof a larger group or society.\nThe reality is that the general\nwellbeing of an economy has a strong\nimpact on every one of its members.\nAs individuals, we often use banks\nand have an interest in companies,\nwhich rely on the corporate system\nand the financial system. In fact,\nwhen we become involved in\nthe larger infrastructure of the\ncorporate world, we are at the whim\nof the fickle nature of markets and\nmacroeconomic swings.\nMacroeconomic issues such as\ngrowth and inflation, as well as\nthe value of the local currency,\ncan change the lives of everybody\nin the country. Low growth and\ninflation can lead to banks adjusting\ntheir interest rates, which affects\nhomeowners, businesses or any entity\nwith a bank account. Interest rates\ncan be volatile and can also change as\nthe result of monetary policy: Mark\nCarney could increase the base rate of\ninterest of the Bank of England from\ntheir current record low of 0.5%,\nwhich would theoretically increase\nthe interest rates of high street banks.\nPerhaps, however, the most direct\nway in which people are affected\nby the wider economy is through\ntheir employment status. One key\nproblem with low growth or even\na recession is that it usually comes\nwith decreasing consumer spending.\nCompanies, therefore, tend to have\nlower sales revenues and thus lower\nprofits during a recession. They often\nscale back production by reducing\ntheir factors of production; for many\npeople this means redundancy.\nUnemployment is defined as the\ndesire to work, without having a job.\nHigh unemployment is a\ndevastating thing for a developed\neconomy. People who are\nunemployment often undergo\na hysteresis effect, where the\nunemployed find it difficult to\nget back into work, perpetuating\nunemployment. If people continue to\nbe unemployed, they need training,\nwhich can be expensive. In addition,\nthey take unemployment benefit\nfrom the government, which is\nthe single largest expenditure by\ngovernment to date.\nEconomists have debated the cause\nof unemployment; they often talk\nof cyclical unemployment; this is\nwhen the time of the year or another\ncycle prevents a market being open,\nlike extra jobs around the Christmas\nperiod. However, the real issue is\nstructural unemployment. This is\nwhen the skills of the people do not\nSAMUEL BODANSKY\nCOMMENT WRITER\nmake the market structure or the\ndemand in the economy. As the\nhorse-drawn carriage lapsed into\nobsolescence, many horse-carriage\ndrivers became unemployed. It is\nvital to maintain a steady supply of\nworkers in order to strengthen the\neconomy.\nImmigration can be the best\nsolution to unemployment. In\ntheory it allows a steady flow of\nyoung, dedicated and means-tested\nworks to rejuvenate an economy. Is\nimmigration the answer in practice,\nhowever?\nThis is open for debate.\nWhat does the economy have to do with me?\nUnemployment perpetuates unemployment. Photo: dailyrecord\n\n"

Kris said someone did it in jail\nwhen he was sleeping but refused to tell us more. He was really happy when we gave him some\nwine and said we could go to the casino later.\nIt was really odd though, as Dorothy was really clingy to Kris all day and I dunno, she seemed to be\ngiving me the cold shoulder. Maybe she is pissed at me because I changed my phone background\nfrom a photo of us a photo of my friends from Saturday\u2019s night out (best night out ever, I miss home,\ncannot wait for Christmas and my 12 hours of freedom)\nWednesday 3rd\nTonight was the ACC night, so I put on my 3D glasses and took Dorothy who was already sporting her\nusual \ufb02ushed face by the time we walked over to Beit after predrinking. Kris Kraye joined us too, and\nhe got really excited when Japan Soc came to the Union dressed as different coloured crayons.\nI lost both of them before coming home but that was \ufb01ne, I got a Burger King on the way back\nand it was good to have a whole single bed to myself even for the \ufb01rst time in a while, even if my\nroommate was snoring.\nThursday 4th\nSo, apparently, Kris Kraye went home with Dorothy. I heard he asked her if she wanted the DPW\nand said he\u2019d give some horizontal welfare. Does that mean they had sex?\nFuck.\n\n"

More promiscuous?\nIs it easier to cheat with a\nlittle help from the internet? How\ndangerous are online games? Is it okay\nfor a mother to essentially spy on her\ndaughter? Is romance dead because of\ntechnology? Does social media reveal\ntoo much about us? With a boom in\nthe use of texts, Facebook, Twitter,\nand all sorts of other platforms, it is\neveryone who has been affected in\nsome ways, by the advancement of\ntechnology. Men, women, children,\nregardless your gender and age, Jason\nReitman\u2019s newest feature is one that\nlooks at how living in the modern\nworld keeping up with the same\nstruggles as before looks like.\nSo yes, we get the insecure teenage\ngirl who has weight issues wanting to\nattract the attention of a boy whose\nmind is only on one thing. We have\nan adorkable ex-high school football\nstar from a broken home who is\naddicted to online gaming. A young\ngirl whose smothering (\u201ccan\u2019t\nspell mother without it\u201d) mother, who\nmight as well call herself the National\nSecurity Agency, is watching her every\nmove. A young girl who yearns to be\na great big star in L.A. An unhappy\nmarried couple who look elsewhere\nto find some much-needed pleasure.\nAnd why not throw in their 15-year-old son, whose unhealthy obsession\nwith pornography is starting to affect\nhis sex life, when it comes to actually\nhaving to perform.\nThere is of course an element of\ntechnology thrown into all the plot-strands at one point or another. The\nfilm cleverly utilises pop-ups of texts/\ntweets/posts/messages and everything\nelse as a way of communication.\nWhat the characters in the film send\noff to one another, we get to see. The\naudience is doing a spying of our\nown too. And the focus is undeniably\nlimited. For a film that wants to\nlook at how social media is affecting/\ninterfering/enhancing our lives, the\nscope is too narrow, and each plot\nstrand is a quick, simplistic view of\na soapy storyline with some flashy\neffects thrown in. Just reading the\ncharacter list above should give you\na clear idea as to how the film is not\noffering anything new for us.\nYes, the internet makes it easier\nfor Don (Adam Sandler) to look for\nan escort, giving the anatomical\nspecifics to be his near-perfect mating\npartner. His wife Helen (Rosemarie\nDeWitt) uses a dating website that\nencourages married couples to cheat.\nThere she meets \u201cSecretluvur\u201d (Dennis\nHaysbert), with whom she can try\nsome cringe-worthy, awkward dirty\ntalking. Their son Chris\u2019 (Travis\nTope) internet search history is quite\nsomething, with certainly a hint of\nfetish for domination. Allison (Elena\nKampouris) refuses to eat, and she\nhas an army of fanatics trying to be\nas thin as possible giving her some\nquestionable advice. Patricia (Jennifer\nGarner), so worried that her daughter\nBrandy (Kaitlyn Dever) is growing up,\ndoes a weekly sweep of everything.\nThis includes Facebook, phone, etc\nwhilst her husband, who may as well\nnot have been written into the film\nsince his role is so miniscule, stands\nby and watches. Seriously. Tim (Ansel\nElgort) finds out his mother, who\nabandoned her family to go live with\nher boyfriend, is now engaged. He\nfinds this out through his Facebook\nnewsfeed. His interest in football has\nhit rock bottom, despite him being\na talented player, and all he cares\nabout now is Guild of War, and his\nfather Kent (Dean Norris), who had\nbig dreams for him as a football star,\nis of course disappointed. Hannah\n(Olivia Crocicchia) takes risqu\u00e9 photos,\nuploading them online for her website\nwhich her \u201cclients\u201d thank her for. The\none taking her pictures? Her mother\nDonna (Judy Greer). Yes. She believes\nthese photos of her scantily-clad\ndaughter are to help with her future\nambition of becoming a star. Who\nis the nuttier one out of Garner and\nGreer? You decide.\nEstablishing the concept of what\nthis film is all about is done in a\nvery effective manner. As we see one\ncharacter use some sort of technology\nin his/her life, we move on to the\nnext, and another one after that. We\nsee their problems clearly, we see the\ninfluence of technology, but as the\nfilm begins to develop into a more\ndramatic one, steering away from\nthe lighter mood, it slowly becomes\nsomething incredibly familiar. The\nfights and tears all happen at the exact\nmoments you would expect them too,\nand there is little surprising about\nthe outcomes and how the individual\nstrand wraps up.\nDespite the predictable setting, there\nis a reason this film works. It is mainly\nthanks to the humour that serves as\nthe film\u2019s major saving grace. To start\noff with, having Emma Thompson\nintermittently narrate the events\nof the film was such a genius move\nthat you wish there was more of it.\nThompson has that very dry but witty\ndelivery of some shocking narration,\nall said in a tone that does not seem to\nbother her one bit.\nReitman has an impeccable cast\nat his disposal. Despite some actions\nthat may seem very, very unlikely,\nthe actors in the roles play them with\nPhoto: variety.com\nso much conviction that it is easy\nto believe people like this can exist.\nGarner\u2019s is a piece of work, restricting\nher daughter in the interest of mostly\nher selfish well-being. She is the kind\nof mother who will make you feel\nbetter about yours. She takes the\nprize on delivering the most \u201cWTF\u201d\nmoments in a film that she will make\nyou want to throw things at her. And\nthere are simply no words to describe\nwhat she gets up to towards the end of\nthe film. Sandler and DeWitt make\ntheir sexless marriage that is devoid\nof any inkling of passion work, and\nrounding off the adult cast, Greer and\nNorris too have their more dramatic\nburst to completely own.\nThere are plenty of laughs to be had,\nalthough very few of them are actually\ndue to a funny, happy event occurring.\nNo, these are uncomfortable, nervous\nlaughs of utter shock and disbelief,\nwhich can be the best kind of laughs,\nwhen used correctly. There are so\nmany embarrassing things that go\nwrong in these people\u2019s lives, that the\nautomatic reaction in the screening\ncinema was laughter.\nMore impressive however are the\nyounger members of the cast. Elgort, a\nrising star hot off his success with the\nDivergent franchise and The Fault in\nOur Stars, is excellent, he\u2019s a very good\ncrier too, as the depressed high school\nstudent finding his way back into the\nworld. He has a very glib outlook on\nlife, as anyone in his position would,\nbut he eventually starts connecting\nwith Brandy. Her role here is\nsurprisingly under-written, although\nthe actress playing the part, Dever, has\ngreat chemistry with her scene partner.\nThe psyche behind an oppressed child,\nwhy she acts out as strangely as she\ndoes, is never fully addressed, and we\nare supposed to simply accept that if\nyou have a controlling mother, it is\nonly natural for a daughter to be as\nquirky as this. Crocicchia is convincing\nplaying the exact same role Mena\nSuvari did in American Beauty, and,\nKampouris, looking painfully thin, is\nat times heart-breaking to watch, with\nher desperation and idealistic view on\nlove getting her into trouble.\nIt\u2019s ultimately a formulaic picture,\nbut one that is not short on laughs.\nAll the strands finish exactly the way\nyou would expect them to, and no\ncharacter is immune from having\neither a soapy meltdown or revelation.\nWhat the film wants to say about\nthe influence of technology is, very\nlimited and it fails to fully explore this\nfrankly overcrowded ensemble. As\nwith most things with Jason Reitman\u2019s\nname on it, it looks at a serious subject\nmatter and decides to have some\nfun with it along the way; and fun is\nwhat Men Women & Children has an\nabundance of.\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nPhoto: diversions.co.nz Photo: whatson.bfi.org.uk\n\n"

After\na networking opportunity at lunch,\nthe forum split off into two branches.\nThe UK Youth Climate Coalition\nheld a workshop that boiled down to\n\u2018telling your story\u2019, a fundamental\nconcept at the heart of every\nenvironmentalist, or aspiring one.\nPeople from all over the world\nshared their stories. A lake in a small\ncommunity, their dependence on\nthis lake, the lake\u2019s part to play being\nwashed away by climate change: all\nsummed up in a moving speech from\none voice in the room whose story of\nher own home left all in silence.\nA bridge from the bustling\ndiscussion of climate change to\nthe story of one person\u2019s home\nwas powerful enough to make a\ncrowd listen intently and incite a\nmeaningful discussion about change.\nAnd that\u2019s what is so special about\nthe forum now. We are at a university\nwhich reaches out to every corner\nof the world for its students, so it is\nimperative to acknowledge this for\nsuch a worldwide issue.\nReaching across the world to\nBorneo, the concurrent event was a\nfilm screening of Sunset over Selungo.\nThe film highlighted the issues faced\nby the Penan tribe and their struggles\nagainst the logging of their jungle\nhome. With home swiftly becoming\na recurring theme, I spoke to fellow\nEarth Science student Sarhan AbdulSamat, from Borneo himself, who\ntold me \u201cI think that it is a very real\nreflection of how minority groups\nin Malaysia are usually treated and\nImperial Hub have hosted the London Climate forum for three years now.

I want to write about\nemotional abuse, its warning signs,\nand illustrate this all with my own\nexperiences because looking back\nnow, I feel like had I known what\nit was that was happening to me, I\nwould have got out of there much,\nmuch earlier.\nYou don\u2019t often hear people talk\nabout emotional abuse, and in part,\nI think this is because sometimes\nneither the victim nor the abuser\nknow it\u2019s happening. Emotional\nabuse is a series of harmful, repetitive\nbehaviours that slowly chip away\nat the victim\u2019s sense of self worth\nand independence, making them\ndislike themselves. I, unfortunately,\nhave experienced first hand what\nit\u2019s like to be in a relationship with\na manipulative and emotionally\nabusive person, and am living proof\nof how it can mess you up and leave\nyou a mere shadow of what you once\nwere. This is my story.\nWhen I first started dating my\nthen partner, I was a fairly confident\nperson but he soon found a way to\nfind my every insecurity and dig at it\nuntil I felt so horrible about myself\nthat I no longer wanted to be alive.\nHe was the first boyfriend I\u2019d ever\nhad \u2013 having come from a strict\nreligious family, I wasn\u2019t allowed to\ndate. This meant that from the get-go,\nI had to hide my relationship from\nmy parents because I was convinced\nthey wouldn\u2019t understand, and\nthat was the first thing I did wrong.\nInitially, he insisted he wanted to\nkeep our relationship a secret from\nour friends, because he wanted it\nto just be between us, because that\nwould make it \u2018more special\u2019. The\nthing about manipulators is that they\nisolate you from others, and do it so\nsubtly that you don\u2019t often notice it\nhappening until it\u2019s too late. We\u2019d\nbeen dating for almost a month until\nhe decided to tell our close friends\nin halls, and that was after another\nfriend of mine had expressed a desire\nto go out with me, an offer that I had\ndenied. My boyfriend decided that it\nwas time for people to know, because\nhe didn\u2019t want anyone else to think\nI \u2018wasn\u2019t his\u2019. That should have been\nthe first red flag. What emotionally\nmanipulative and abusive people do\nis try and make you so dependent\non them by isolating you from your\nfriends and family that you start to\nbelieve they have some sort of claim\non you, and worse, that you want\nthem to have a claim on you.\nNext came the ruining of my\nself esteem \u2013 it started subtly at\nfirst, as these things do, with small\ncomments here and there. He would\nmock me in front of our mutual\nfriends under the guise of \u2018flirty\nbanter\u2019, try and counter my every\npoint in group conversations and\noften cut me off when I would try\nand speak. When I would tell him,\nin private, that his actions were\nmaking me uncomfortable or upset,\nhe mock me for being over sensitive,\ntell me to toughen up and learn to\ntake a joke and that he didn\u2019t mean\nto offend me. When we would go\nout with a group of people that I\ndidn\u2019t know, he never made any\neffort to introduce me as anything\nbut his girlfriend, and by that\npoint, he had whittled down my self\nconfidence enough that I did not\nwant to participate in conversations\nanymore in fear of being mocked or\ncut off. As time went by, it started\nto get less subtle. Whenever I would\ntell a joke, he would tell me that it\nwasn\u2019t witty and would dismiss it,\nand then repeat later in a different\ngroup taking credit for it. A couple\nof times, I called him out on it,\nbut he would claim that I was just\nmisremembering it and he had come\nup with it on his own. He made me\ndoubt myself so much that I couldn\u2019t\ntrust even my own memory after a\nwhile. Now, these are all clear signs\nof emotional abuse, when someone\nmakes you doubt yourself so much\nthat you no longer trust your own\nmemory, there should be warning\nsigns going off in your head.\nWhenever I would mention that I\nhad a problem with how he treated\nme, he would twist my words to\nmake it seem like I was being needy,\nor childish, and make me feel\nlike I was overreacting. He would\nmake sure that I knew he was a great\nboyfriend by buying me presents, and\nconstantly bring this up in arguments\nto make sure I never forgot that\nhe obviously loved me and that I\nshouldn\u2019t put him under so much\nstress when I know he\u2019s so busy with\nwork. He would refuse to speak to me\nuntil I apologised for overreacting.\nIf you\u2019re with someone who makes\nyou think that the emotions you\u2019re\nfeeling due to something they\u2019ve done\nare in some way unjustified, then\nthat person is not worth being with. I\ncannot stress this enough, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter what the other person meant\nby their comments or actions, if you\nfeel unsafe and bring this up, and\nthey then constantly try and make\nyou feel bad for feeling offended and\nrefuse to apologise, then they\u2019re not a\nvery nice person.\nNow, he was never physically\nabusive towards me and honestly\nit might have made it much easier\nto get out of that relationship if he\nhad been. We\u2019ve somehow been\nconditioned to think of physical\nand sexual abuse as being the only\n\u2018legitimate\u2019 types of abuse, which\nmeans it cost me three years and\nmy mental health before I realised\nthat something was amiss and that it\nwasn\u2019t just me overreacting. Now, half\na year later, after months of therapy\nI\u2019ve slowly come to notice the signs\nand just wish someone had told me\nabout them sooner. So I guess that\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m doing now. If any of these\nsituations seem familiar to you, then\nit might be worth thinking long and\nhard about your relationship (be it\nwith a partner, parent, or friend).\nThank you so much for sharing your\nexperiences with us. Please remember\nthat if you\u2019re feeling under pressure, talk\nto someone.

Most kids\nwould detest the taste and texture\nof coffee; I remember in my case,\nit was either some \u201cweird insipid\nswamp water\u201d or \u201crocket fuel gloop\u201d\ndepending on what brew method\nwas used (or if heaven forbid, it was\ninstant.) Just as well, as tots aren\u2019t\nmeant to consume the stuff.\nCall it my palate growing up, but\nafter discovering as a tween how nice\ncoffee was with the addition of dairy\nand sugar (not drunk, but in tiramisu)\nand appreciating the aroma, I was\nslowly introduced to better coffee bit\nby bit. Our generation\u2019s lucky to have\nseen the evolution of coffee culture\nthrough two different waves: second-wave coffee chains like Starbucks,\nand third wave coffee which is the\nspecialty stuff out of microroasteries,\nsold in independent corner cafes.\nI do appreciate though that for\nmost of us, that cup of joe is a means\nto an end: staying awake for those\npesky deadlines. Other than instant,\nor filter and espresso-based drinks\nfrom the Imperial caf\u00e9s, there\u2019s a lot\nmore to the world of coffee. In this\nhopefully multi-part series, I\u2019ll start\nby looking at different brew methods\n\u2013 I\u2019ve picked three to look at.

Little did I know\nat the time that the processes used to decaffeinate\ncoffee were actually worse\u2013Swiss water process\ndecaf wasn't really sold back in Malaysia.Ah,to be\nnaive again...\nI guess for me,the appeal of these lovely drinks\nisn\u2019t just because they bring peeps together or\nencourage productivity.Neither is it because of the\nworld of flavours out there.Nah,it's the fact that so\nmany little things influence (some greatly so) the\ninal outcome of the brewed beverage.Every new\ncup brewed is an experiment waiting to happen.\nWhat are these little things? Water-to-infusionmaterial (tea/coffee) ratio,temperature,time,grind/\nparticle size,origin (for coffee),brew method (ilter/\ncafetiere)...I could go on for yonks.\nEither way,I also love how both the brewing and\nthe drinking processes can be highly meditative\none minute,and a habit-on-autopilot the next.I\nind crafting latte art for my\u201cpseudopresso\u201d/fauxespresso beverages incredibly relaxing and fun.That\nmug obviously has a different taste and vibe to the\none I grind at 11am in the Felix ofice,just because my\nbody is threatening to make me doze off somehow.\nWhat chameleons these beverages are\u2013what\npossibilities,too!\nIncidentally,I\u2019ve somehow managed to overwork\nmyself this week.Investigating the death of Professor\nGrimm with News has been really engaging,but as a\nresult of the phone calls I\u2019ve made chasing up for info\n(and a delayed wave of freshers\u2019flu),I now have half\nmy voice\u2013ergo,Lemsip and Joe's Tea Co Peppermint\nover the last few days.Look after yourselves,guys...\nthe term\u2019s nearly over,so hang in there!\nLivin\u2019 La Vida Mocha\nCarol Ann Cheah talks java... the sippable kind, duh\n\"Our\ngeneration\nhas\nseen the\nevolution\nof coffee\nculture\nthrough\ntwo\ndifferent\nwaves\"\nya know). You just mix ground coffee,\nadd boiling water, steep, plunge and\npour.\nThe one downside to it is that it\u2019s\na massive pain in the posterior to\nthoroughly clean; old coffee oils love\nclinging to the fine filter mesh and\nthe many other nooks and crannies\nin a cafetiere. However, the small\nfootprint, relative cheapness and\nreally small learning curve mean\nthat it\u2019s a popular choice for people\ngraduating from instant coffee for\nthe first time.\nStovetop/Moka Pot\nA favourite in Europe and Latin\nAmerica, with an extremely iconic\ndesign. These are traditionally\nmade of aluminium, with a bottom\nchamber filled with water and a\nground coffee gasket screwed on top.\nThis is then heated to boiling point,\nwhere steam builds up and is then\nforced through holes in the coffee\ngasket, creating the brew.\nThey\u2019re not the easiest to clean,\nmuch like French presses. The\nresulting coffee though does have\nextremely rich body (hence being\ndubbed stovetop \u201cespresso\u201d makers),\nand the brewing process is definitely\nmore engaging.

The AeroPress (AP),\ninvented in 2005, consists of two\npolypropylene chambers: one with\na rubber seal that acts as a \u201cplunger\u201d\nto brew the coffee with the help of\npressure (nowhere near that of an\nactual espresso machine, of course).\nIt has all the advantages of a French\npress and is rather cheap, but also\nwith the added plusses of super-easy\ncleanup, higher durability (being\nglass-free to begin with) and a much\nshorter brew time.\nCoffee brewed this way can take\non many qualities, depending on\nwhether the user makes espresso-style or Americano/long-black-style\ndrinks. Regardless, they tend to have\nthe flavour clarity of a filter coffee\nbut with a stronger body that\u2019s just\nunder french press coffee.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 29\n05.12.2014\nFELIX\nFilm\nilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park & Jack Steadman\nWhen the Saints Go Marching In\nWhat happens when you\nput together a grumpy\nold man and the next\ndoor neighbour\u2019s slightly, odd but\nintelligent child? The grumpy man\nwho everyone hates at the beginning\nof the film does something remarkable\nfor the kid, and we discover that\nactually, the moody old man is a\nreal softie at heart. An episode of US\nsitcom Modern Family finds a young\nchild bonding with the next door\nneighbour, a retired fireman. The\nmother is concerned. But he lists Gran\nTorino, True Grit and Up as examples\nof how things worked out in the end.\nSt. Vincent essentially follows the exact\nsame formula. We are introduced to\nVincent (Bill Murray), a loner of a man\nwho drinks too much, then drives, and\nspends too much and is generally the\nlast person you would want looking\nafter your child. Not knowing any of\nthis, desperate single mother Maggie\n(Melissa McCarthy), who is far too\nbusy at her work making a living for\nherself and her son Oliver (Jaeden\nLieberher), recruits Vincent\u2019s help\u2026\nfor an hourly babysitter\u2019s fee of\ncourse.\nVincent\u2019s life continues relatively\nnormally despite having a kid to look\nafter in his everyday routine. The\ntwo of them hit the racing tracks, his\nfavourite bar, and Oliver even runs\ninto Vincent\u2019s sort-of girlfriend who\nworks as a stripper/prostitute, Daka\n(Naomi Watts). Daka is Russian and\npregnant, which obviously means she\nis here merely for comedic purposes.\nWatts makes the most out of her\nlimited, and ultimately pointless role,\nher scenes could honestly have all\nbeen edited out and no huge impact\nwould be made, and the only thing her\ncharacter contributes is some mild\ncomic relief due to Daka\u2019s failure to\ngrasp the civilised American culture\nbecause, you know, she is Russian in\na Hollywood production after all. It\nis rare to see Watts in a role like this,\na comedic one, and perhaps this is\nsomething she does have a knack for,\nbut in such a thinly written role it is\neasy to overlook her contribution to\nthe overall narrative.\nBut then we discover things about\nVincent that actually portray him\nin a completely different light. He\nregularly visits his wife suffering from\nAlzheimer\u2019s and insists on doing all\nthe laundry for her. She of course\ndoes not remember him one bit, but\nST. VINCENT\nDirector: Theodore Meli\nScreenplay: Theodore Meli\nCast: Bill Murray, Melissa\nMcCarthy, Naomi Watts, Chris\nO\u2019Dowd, Terrence Howard,\nJaeden Lieberher\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nhis undying love for his wife helps\nhim persevere. He also bonds with\nOliver. Oliver is the awkward new kid\nat school with bullies targeting him.\nVincent gives these means boys a\nproper telling-off. Oliver and the main\nbully becomes best mates in the end.\nA contrived plot device that makes\nlittle sense. Vincent is also a retired\narmy veteran, a fun fact that only\ncomes up whenever the film needs it\nto. It is never used to shape Vincent\u2019s\ncharacter as a whole.\nThe trouble with St. Vincent is that\nit is all so painfully obvious to see\nhow everything will pan out. Making\nmatters worse in the plot overall,\nis that Oliver has been assigned\nhomework to research into the life\nof someone who he considers to be\na Saint. Given the title of the film,\nguess who he is going to choose for his\nproject.\nIn all fairness, predictability matters\nvery little, as long as the actual content\nof the bonding process between the\ntwo protagonists does not feel too\ncontrived or manipulative but the\nepisodic, scattershot portrayal we\nsee here is too superficial to be taken\nseriously. Vincent, in the end, is\nsupposed to have had a huge impact\non Oliver\u2019s life. And for that Oliver\nand Maggie are rightly grateful. But\njust how on earth Vincent manages\nthis is never quite clearly explored.\nThis is why the grand finale in which\nVincent is honoured to being Oliver\u2019s\nSaint, is never quite as moving as it\nshould be. The film tries to make it\nThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\nTHE FACE OF LOVE\nDirector: Theodore Meli\nScreenplay: Theodore Meli\nCast: Annette Bening, Ed\nHarris, Jess Weixler, Robin\nWilliams\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nas heart-warming as possible, and\nsucceeds on some levels, but it never\nquite gets across the huge crowd-pleasing affair it wants to.\nThe one reason the film manages\nto get by is thanks to the wonderful\nperformances. Murray, back in a lead\ncomedy role after years of being away,\nis perfect for the role. Grumpy enough\nto pass as a man with lots of issues,\nsadness and frustration, but with\nenough soft side showing through to\nbe an ultimately likeable individual.\nIt is a shame the script never does\nhim justice. Given that he is at the\ncentre of the film, it is surprising to\nsee how little is actually looked at\nproperly with him. Murray\u2019s scenes of\ninteraction with the young Lieberher\nare the real highlight, with the two\nactors playing off each other\u2019s talent\nwith excellent chemistry. There is a\nbond that is established between the\ntwo, which is why the final scene is\nnot a complete and utter disaster.\nAnother strong performance comes\nfrom Melissa McCarthy. After a string\nof roles that involved the actress\nessentially swearing and shouting as\nmuch as she could for laughs, here\nwe have a more intelligent character\nplayed by a very accomplished actress.\nHere is to hoping more roles like this\nfor McCarthy.\nUltimately it is a film let down by\na sloppy script that never bothers to\ndo anything decent with potentially\ninteresting characters played by big\nnames. It is pleasant enough, but could\nhave been much more.\nPhoto: shockya.com\nPhoto: popmatters.com\nPhoto: spyce.co.ke\nThe premise is a ridiculous\none, but it could have worked.\nA struggling widow meets a\nman who looks exactly like her late\nhusband. The husband\u2019s role and\nthe new man\u2019s role are played by\nthe same actor, so we understand\nNikki\u2019s (Annette Bening) shock and\namazement when she accidentally\nruns into Tom Young (Ed Harris),\nan arts professor, five years after\nthe death of her husband Garret\n(Ed Harris again) in Mexico. She\nis hesitant at first, but eventually\ndecides to pursue a relationship with\nhim. She comes across as a complete\nlunatic of course, completely breaking\ndown and sobbing in front of the\nprofessor upon their first meeting,\nand yet a romantic plot strand is\nforced upon them, and so onto the\naudience too.\nBening is without doubt at her best\nwhen she is mourning for her dead\nhusband. As her character progresses,\nwe get hints of how mentally unstable\nNikki may be: constantly referring\nto Tom as Garret, and wanting to\nrecapture the moments she once\nshared with her husband. These acts\nof desperation are sad to watch of\ncourse, especially when so movingly\ncaptured by Bening, but what\nblossoms between Nikki and Tom is\nso preposterous and farcical that it\nis difficult to take any aspect of this\nseriously.\nTom is essentially cast aside as a\nredundant character, and the more\nthe film tries to make the romance\nbetween the two work, the more\nunbearable it becomes. It could have\nbeen a sweet premise, but with such\npoorly defined characters confessing\ntheir love for one another at the most\nrandom moments, even the coupling\nof Bening and Harris cannot sell it.\nIt gets more interesting when\nNikki\u2019s daughter gets involved, but\neven this does not last long enough.\nThe late Robin Williams is in a\nthankless role as the friend-zoned\nneighbour of Nikki, a fellow widower.\nAnd the less that is said about the\nhorrendous ending, that brings\ntogether Nikki and Tom\u2019s ex-wife\nAnn (Amy Brenneman), the better.\n\n"

His approach was most\nunconventional; the campaign was\nshot in locations on a road trip from\nLondon to Brighton which Bourdin\nhad taken in his Cadillac, and\nfeatured no model apart from a pair\nof mannequin legs cut off just below\nthe knee. Despite being simplistic\ndue to the absence of the model, the\nphotographs nonetheless convey\na most elaborate type of dramatic\nnarrative which is characteristic of\nBourdin\u2019s photographs.\nThe main upstairs gallery features\na collection of large iconic Bourdin\nphotographs from Vogue Paris,\namong unpublished ones, all hung\nin quadruplets. Bourdin had a large\ncollection of film books where a\nsingle movie could be \u201cviewed\u201d still\nby still, and such an arrangement\npays homage to that. Each quadruplet\nis much like a collection of movie\nstills from a film noir, which tells a\nloosely related narrative. A girl lies\nface down on the floor, naked, while\nscarlet paint leaks from her mouth.\nAnother girl makes a phone call from\na booth, all the while in front of two\npairs of legs which appear to be lying\nlimply on a sand-pile, with the torsos\nleaning out of view. Two models lie\nin a bed, a pile of sauerkraut and\nsausages before them; one girl eats a\nsausage with one hand, while giving\nthe other girl a sausage with the\nother. All these appear to be unlikely\nad campaigns, and yet they were\ncommissioned by high-end clients\nsuch as Vogue Paris, Pentax calendar,\nVersace, and Charles Jourdan.\nBourdin\u2019s sought after photographs\nwere revolutionary in that they\ngave glamour a surreal and sexually\nsinister hue, and that is why the\nfantasy they depicted captivated and\nmesmerized their audience.\nIn another room are four screens\nwhich play segments of Bourdin\u2019s\nunique Super-8 short films,\naccompanied by music. Suddenly,\none is transported to an atmosphere\nof Wes Anderson-like dreamy\nmelancholy the very opposite of the\nsinister and surreal one sensed in the\nprevious gallery. Watching a French\nmaid dance with a trouser-less man\nin a blazer and dress-shirt is a most\nrefreshing and charming experience.\nBourdin was revolutionary not\nonly in his content, but also his\napproach. There was a precise science\nto his art \u2013 nothing was accidental,\nbut the product of a meticulous\nprocess. Unlike his contemporaries,\nBourdin would submit a ready layout\nindicating the precise placement of\nhis photographs to the magazine\npublishers. Examples of Bourdin\u2019s\nlayouts and contact sheets are\nshowcased in the exhibition, as well\nas polaroids of landscapes which\nBourdin took and marked with black\ntape to focus in on a particular area\nthat interested him as a possible\nbackground. Similarly, it is worth\nnoticing that the photographs\nexhibited in quadruplets in the main\ngallery are all slightly different sizes\n\u2013 Bourdin purposefully adjusted\nthe widths and length when editing\nto achieve the focus which was most\nperfect for the subject and content of\neach specific photograph.\nBourdin would also surprise his\ncontemporaries by eagerly accepting\nassignments of shoe and accessory\nadvertising campaigns, normally\ngiven to more inexperienced\nphotographers due to their\nconstraints. Bourdin, on the contrary,\nfelt the tight boundaries of such\nnarrow focus did the opposite \u2013 they\nprovided him with the space for\ncreative freedom, and the ability to\nexperiment within the boundaries.\nAn example of such campaign is\nshown in the exhibition in a room\nsolely dedicated to Bourdin\u2019s\nphotographs for a shoe advertisement\ncampaign, which were taken of two\nmodels in a hotel room, and clearly\nshows Bourdin\u2019s mastery in creating\nsuch novel diversity out of a simple\nsetting.\nAnother room of the exhibition\ndisplays something most surprising\nand unexpected of a conventional\nfashion photographer \u2013 his paintings,\nand thus Bourdin continues to prove\n\"Guy\nBourdin's\nphotos\nconvey\na most\nelaborate\ntype of\ndramatic\nnarrative\"\nto be an artist beyond his being\nestablished as a fashion photographer.\nThe subjects and motifs which are\npresent in the paintings are paralleled\nin some of Bourdin\u2019s photographs,\nand these are displayed alongside.\nUnlike the photographs, most of\nthe painting which are exhibited are\nunfinished, showing traces of reworks\nand alterations. Even the finished\npaintings are neither dated nor\nsigned.\nBourdin created the perfect dreamlike atmosphere which captivates\nthe viewer with its strangeness. A\nsense of the unexpected and the\nartificial are central in Bourdin\u2019s\nphotographs \u2013 in them, he engineered\na surreal and dark world. The\nstaged world is personal to the\nviewer \u2013 the mind of each fills in\nthe story of the fantasy, and that is\nperhaps how Bourdin\u2019s photographs\nsubconsciously and indirectly create\ndesire, and sold the product. But there\nis a deeper significance behind the\nadvertisements; much like Bourdin\u2019s\nbeloved film noirs, his photographs\noffer an unexpected escape from the\nfamiliarity of reality \u2013 one catches a\nglimpse, for a brief moment, of the\nrich and strange world as Bourdin\nsaw it.\nGuy Bourdin: Image Maker is on at\nSomerset House until 15th\nMarch 2015.\nTickets are \u00a39 adults; \u00a37 concessions.\nA talk with curator Alistair O\u2019Neill,\nexamining the lasting influence of\nBourdin, will be held on 11th\nDecember.\nTickets available online.\nA rarely seen work from the artist's archive, 1979 Photo: Guy Bourdin\nCharles Jourdan, Spring 1979 - an example of Bourdin's surreal and sexually sinister style\nPhoto: Guy Bourdin\n\n"

Photo:Keith Barnham\nJames Bezer talks to Professor\nKeith Barnham about his vision\nfor the future of solar energy\nYou originally started your career\nin particle physics\u2014why did you\nchange to researching solar panels?\nI loved particle physics: I worked at\nCERN and Berkeley and it was very\nexciting at both places.\nWhen I joined Imperial, I\nspent much of my time at CERN.\nCollaborations were getting bigger\nand bigger and it hit me that I would\nhave to spend more of my time in\nGeneva. We used to bring bubble\nchamber film back to Imperial for\nanalysis, but as the beam experiments\nbuilt up, you had to spend more of\nyour time there. Did I want to keep\ncommuting to Switzerland, instead of\nworking and teaching at Imperial?\nAnd how useful was particle\nphysics\u2014it was fascinating, but what\npractical use is was it in a world with a\nlot of problems?\nPhotovoltaics have historically\nbeen expensive and inefficient,\nbut this has improved a lot in\nrecent years. What technological\nadvances have made this possible?\nIt\u2019s because of the fall in the cost of\nsilicon, by around a factor of four.\nThis wasn\u2019t technical, though, but\npolitical. The Germans decided to\nstimulate demand with a feed-in\ntariff. They hoped this would build\nthe market, causing mass production\nand a fall in price.\nThat happened, but it was a big\nsurprise that EU and US industries\ndidn\u2019t invest as much as the Chinese.\nThey made a political decision to\nput money into big systems, initiate\nmass production: that\u2019s where the\ndrop in cost really came from, to the\ndetriment of EU production and my\nown company.\nYou group created the most\nefficient solar cells in the world.\nWhat was novel about your design?\nIt\u2019s very different technology to\nother photovoltaics. Ours is based on\nGallium Arsenide semiconductors,\nwhich most resembles the technology\nin mobile phones. There\u2019s at least\none such chip in everyone\u2019s mobile\nphone.\nFirst you have three cells grown\non top of each other by the same\ntechniques used to make LEDs. The\nthree cells are arranged to make best\nuse of the solar spectrum. The first\nhas a very wide band gap, so it only\nabsorbs high-energy blue-green light.\nRed and orange go through to the\nsecond cell where they are absorbed.\nLow-energy infra-red passes all the\nway down to the bottom layer.\nEach photon gets absorbed in\nthe appropriate sub-cell. It\u2019s the\ngoldilocks principle: each cell is just\nright for the photons they absorb.\nThe three cells are then put\ntogether in series: the voltage adds up,\ngiving a very high efficiency of over\n40%.\nTo make this very efficient, you\nwant to optimize the band gap of each\ncell. Our technology, uniquely, uses\nquantum wells to adjust the band\ngap, by changing their depth. 50 of\nthem in our photovoltaics enables us\nto adjust the band gap and optimize\nhighly efficient cells for different\nspectral conditions. It\u2019s the same\nprinciple behind all lasers: that\u2019s\nhow you make them emit different\ncolours.\nCurrently, solar cells are often\nused in deserts, where there\u2019s plenty\nof sunlight. The spectrum in the UK\nis very different from in the desert,\nthough: we have a redder sun, more\ncloud and diffuse blue light. In the\nfuture we could generate electricity\nusing smart windows by putting\nphotovoltaics on blinds. This would\nhave a different light spectrum again,\nthat we could optimize our cells to.\nUltimately it could be used with\nlenses to concentrate light onto\nthe system, and with high enough\nconcentration, our technology could\nbe even cheaper than conventional\nChinese-made silicon devices.\nWith quantum wells, we can\noptimize the cell for different\nspectral conditions.\nThe whole idea is just solving the\nSchrodinger equation for a square\nwell: the first, simplest quantum\nmechanics problem we teach\nto physics students and here\u2019s a\npractical application of it. What I\nreally like about it is that the simplest\npart of quantum mechanics has\npractical applications in solving\nglobal warming.\nHow do your cells compare to\nother technologies like plastic\nelectronics?\nI would say they\u2019re complimentary.\nThey\u2019re all great areas that should be\nresearched.

Each day, Emma\nSulkowicz, a 21 year old 3rd year\nstudent can be seen carrying her 23\nkg mattress around campus. It\u2019s not\nthat she\u2019s found a drastic solution\nto tiredness at lectures; but rather a\npowerful performance art piece. Carry\nThat Weight is Sulkowicz\u2019s final year\nthesis in which she vows to carry the\nmattress on which she was assaulted\nuntil the man she says raped her is\nremoved from campus.\nThe piece itself, even removed\nfrom her story, is powerful. It brings\nto mind Tracey Emin\u2019s My Bed, now\nbeing exhibited at the Tate Modern.\nThe two pieces, quite aside from the\nobvious superficial similarities share\na confessional element; Emin\u2019s piece\nwas designed to open up dialogue\nabout mental illness and preserved\nthe artist\u2019s bed as she had left it after\nsuffering from a nervous breakdown;\nCarry That Weight aims to throw light\non rape and sexual assault across\ncollege campuses. Sulkowicz\u2019s gesture\nis especially powerful as so often\nvictims of sexual violence remain\nsilent because they are afraid of the\nstigma they face in talking about\ntheir experience. \u201cIn my case, I was\nraped in my own bed\u2019, Sulkowicz told\nDemocracy Now host Amy Goodman.\n\u201c[My rape] desecrated one of the most\nintimate and private places of my\nlife and the way that I\u2019ve brought my\nstory from a place that I keep secret\nout into the public eye sort of mirrors\ncarrying the mattress out into the\nlight for everyone.\u201d\nWomen who have been raped often\nsay that they feel branded as a victim\nor, worse, a liar out to ruin a man\u2019s\nlife, when they speak out about their\npast. Sulkowicz is no exception. When\nshe revealed her story as part of her\nthesis, she too faced stigma. Writing\nfor TIME she said \u201cI\u2019ve lost friends\nbecause some people just don\u2019t\nunderstand what it means to be raped.\nOne friend asked me if I thought that\nmy rapist would be expelled from\nschool. I said, \u201cI really hope so.\u201d And\nhe said, \u201cPoor guy\u201d.\u201d\nShe may have lost friends, but\nSulkowicz has also gained a wide\ngroup of supporters. Part of her\nperformance is following a set of\n\u2018rules of engagement\u2019 that include\nallowing herself to be helped in\ncarrying the mattress if someone\nspontaneously takes it up with her\n(though she cannot ask for help) \u2013 a\ndeeply symbolic and literal gesture.\nIndeed Sulkowicz says that she has\ngarnered so much support that\nshe hardly ever needs to carry the\nmattress alone, someone invariably\nhelps her to carry it from class to\nclass.\nOn 29th\nOctober, No Red Tape,\nCarry That Weight, and StudentWorker Solidarity organised an\ninternational day of protest. The\nprotest saw students across 130\ncampuses \u2013 from Stanford University\nto Central European University\nin Budapest \u2013 carry mattresses in\nsupport of Sulkowicz; demonstrators\nat Columbia University dumped\n28 mattresses outside the home of\nColumbia President Lee Bollinger, in\nthe hope of showing that \u2018the ball was\nin his court\u2019 to take up proceedings\nagainst the student who alledgedly\nraped Sulkowicz and two other\nwomen.\nPerformance art and political\nmovements have always been closely\nintertwined. The hacktivist group\nAnonymous wore Guy Fawkes\nmasks to protest police brutality in\nthe killing of the killing of Michael\nBrown in Ferguson, Missouri. In\nLondon in 2011, a performer lay\nnaked on the floor of the Tate\nBritain\u2019s Great Hall splashed with oil,\nemulating a bird caught in a oil spill\nin protest against the Tate accepting\nsponsorship from BP.\nIt is yet to be seen whether Carry\nThat Weight will have a political\nimpact; almost three months after\nSulkowicz started carrying her\nmattress around, her alleged rapist\nstill remains enrolled at Columbia.\nFollowing the October protest,\nstudents at Columbia were charged\n$471 for \u2018clean-up\u2019.\nIn America, it is estimated 1 in\n5 women are assaulted in college,\nand the picture doesn\u2019t look much\nbetter on this side of the pond; In\n2010, a study by the National Union\nof Students found that one in seven\nwomen experienced a serious physical\nor sexual assault during their time as\na student. Speaking to The Telegraph\nin May of this year, Sarah Pine, Vice\nPresident for women at Oxford\nUniversity Student Union, says that\nin the last year alone she\u2019s heard\njust under 50 stories of rape from\nfemale students whilst working for It\nHappens Here, the student led Oxford\nUniversity organisation that aims to\nraise awareness about sexual assaults\nat university.\nEarlier this month, The White\nHouse launched It\u2019s On Us a new\ncampaign aiming to raise awareness\nof issues of sexual assault and rape.\nIt is hoped that by bringing more\nattention to the unsavoury reality\nof these crimes, whether through\ngovernment projects or the bravery\nand eloquence of people such as\nEmma Sulkowicz, that sexual assault\ncan be eliminated from university\ncampuses.\nEditorial: The\nDebate Issue\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nIf war is the engine-driver of\nhistory,then surely art is the\nsame for debate.What else can\npromote discussion,outrage,and\nintrigue like art can? From the\nlong-running controversy stirred\nup by the annual Turner Prize,to\nthe innumerable think-pieces,\nspringing up like mushrooms\nafter a rainstorm,every time Tate\npurchases are particularly risible\nwork.\nIn this issue of FelixArts we are\nlooking at how art and artists can\nstimulate debate,adding fuel to\nthe ire of popular opinion.We\nstart off with Emma Sulkowicz,a\n21 year old artist who is carrying\nher mattress around Columbia\ncampus until her rapist is expelled.\nIndira Mallik looks at this powerful\nprotest,and links it back to other\npieces of performance art that\ndouble as protest.\nWe then move on to have a look at\nthe TateModern\u2019s latest exhibition,\nTime,Conflict,andPhotography,in\nwhich the lasting legacy of war\nis explored through the work\nof photographers.They use the\ncamera to excavate the past,and\nlook at the effects that warfare can\nhave today; it is seriously powerful\nstuff,compounded by a seriously\nsmart curatorial twist that sees us\nmoving away from the moment of\nthe event.\nBut not all debate needs to be\nabout misery; Guy Bourdin,\nthe fashion photographer who\nrevolutionised the industry,created\na vast amount of debate with his\nbold,loud,sensuous depictions\nof high fashion.Elizaveta\nTchebaniouk heads down to\nSomerset House,where the most\nextensive retrospective of his work\nis currently being held,to ind that\nunderneath the glamour and glitz,\nthere is a dark,surreal heart.\nFinally,we take a look at Her\nNakedSkin,a play about the\nsuffragettes that ran this week\nat Guildhall School of Music &\nDrama; taking this as a starting\npoint,we take a look at the history\nof women writers in theatre.\nDespite centuries of progress,for\nwomen playwrights,the British\ntheatre industry is still stuck in\nthe dark age,passing over their\nscripts in favour of their male\ncontemporaries.\nWith this issue of FelixArts,we\nwant to achieve what all great\nworks of art are able to do: stir up\ncontroversy,provoke debate,and\u2013\nperhaps most importantly\u2013make\nyou think.\nIndira Mallik looks at Emma Sulkowicz\u2019s Carry That Weight\n\n"

It details how\nGrimm was told he would have to\nleave College after not securing\nenough research funding.\nGrimm had previously published\nover 70 papers covering cell signalling\nand anti-cancer genes in high-impact\njournals during his career, alongside\ntwo books and several review articles.\nGrimm describes in his email that\nthis was a case of \u201cpublish and perish.\u201d\nThe email was sent three weeks after\ncolleagues were informed of his\ndeath on the 29th of September from\nMartin Wilkins, Head of Department\nof Medicine and Grimm\u2019s boss.\nGrimm describes how Wilkins told\nhim that although he had submitted\nthe highest number of grant\napplications, and despite already\nacquiring \u00a3135,000, he had to obtain\na total of \u00a3200,000 all in one go in the\nform of a programme grant to remain\nworking at Imperial.\nThe email outlines how Wilkins\ntold Grimm in May 2013 that he\nwould have to leave Imperial within\nthe year if he didn\u2019t acquire enough\nfunding. Wilkins then sent him\nan \u201cultimatum email\u201d in March of\nthis year, constituting \u201cthe start of\ninformal action\u201d against Grimm. This\nemail has since been published in a\nfollow-up article on the Times Higher\nEducation website, and we have\nrepublished it below\nWilkins stated in the email that\nhe expected Grimm to succeed in\nsecuring a programme grant as lead\nPrincipal Investigator (PI), and would\nhave to achieve this within 12 months\n\u201cin order for [Grimm\u2019s] performance\nto be considered at an acceptable\nstandard.\u201d\nGrimm goes on to state in his email\nhow \u201cthis is not a university anymore\nbut a business\u2026 with very few\nprofiteering and the rest of us being\nmilked for money.\nWilkins says in his email to Grimm\nthat he is \u201ccommitted to doing what I\ncan to help you succeed and will meet\nwith you monthly to discuss your\nprogression and success in achieving\nthe objective outlined.\u201d\nHe goes on to say to Grimm that\n\u201cYou have previously initiated\ndiscussions in our meetings regarding\nopportunities outside of Imperial\nCollege and I know you have been\nexploring opportunities elsewhere.\u201d\n\u201cShould this be the direction you\nwish to pursue, then I will do what I\ncan to help you succeed.\u201d\nFollowing the email, Nigel Buck,\nOperating Officer for the Faculty of\nMedicine, sent two similar emails\nto those internal and external to the\nCollege who received the email.\nBuck\u2019s emails do not address the\nlegitimacy of the email from Grimm,\nnor its contents, but does say that\nthe death is under investigation\nby statutory authorities, and that\nStefan\u2019s death came as a \u201cgreat shock.\u201d\nFelix has been unable to confirm\nhis cause of death, but has been told\nthat the West London Coroner\u2019s\nDistrict adjourned an inquest into his\ndeath on October 8th. It is unknown\nwhen they will reopen the inquest and\nwhen the exact cause of death will be\nmade public.\nFelix was told last week, prior to the\npublication of Grimm\u2019s email, that\nCollege is currently reviewing the\nrelevant \u201cpolicies and procedures\u201d\nand present the findings in a report\nby a group of senior College staff.\nThe Director of Human Resources\naccompanied by the Senior Consul,\nProfessor Richard Thompson, is\nleading the review.\nA college spokesperson said that\n\u201cContrary to assertions elsewhere,\nProfessor Grimm was not under\nformal review nor had he been\ngiven any notice of dismissal. It is\nstandard practice in higher education\ninstitutions to conduct both\ninformal and formal performance\nmanagement.\u201d\n\u201cIn this tragic case, the process was\nat the informal stage.\u201d\n\u201cHis line manager met with him\non a number of occasions to see how\nthe College could help him to develop\nmore competitive grant applications,\nfor example through internal peer-review, collaborations and letters of\nsupport.\nThis is in line with requests\nfrom funders of research to ensure\napplications are of sufficient quality\nto be considered.\u201d\nProfessor James Stirling, Provost\nof Imperial College London, said:\n\u201cImperial seeks to give every member\nof its community the opportunity\nto excel and to create a supportive\nenvironment in which their careers\nmay flourish. Where we become\naware that the College is falling short\nof this standard of support to its\nmembers, we will act.\u201d\nGrimm\u2019s email initially surfaced on\na blog written by David Colquhoun, a\nUniversity College London emeritus\nprofessor of pharmacology, who hosts\ndcscience.net. He was forwarded the\nemail from associates at Imperial.\nHe states on his blog: \u201cNo doubt any\nImperial staff member would be in\ngreat danger if they were to publish\nthe email.\u201d\nSaid Colquhoun about his blog post,\n\u201cThis bullying has been going on for\nyears, and it is more prevalent than\nit used to be. The message to Grimm\nwas not to do more research, but that\nyou mustn\u2019t do cheap research.\u201d\n\u201cI think there should be a petition\nset up for a public inquiry into his\ndeath, and ask what the authorities\nare going to do about it.\u201d\n\u201cIt just seems Imperial are doing\ntheir best to whitewash it. They rarely\nget to the heart of the matter.\u201d\nProfessor sends posthumous email on \u201cH\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nPhoto: University of Pennsylvania\n\n"

But do you know about\nthe many benefits of tea? Thankfully\nthey\u2019re not all hard-to-stomach bitter\nbrews; there are so many different\ntypes out there that there is bound to\nbe one that you\u2019ll come to really enjoy\nthe flavours of.\nEveryone has heard of the\ntraditional English Breakfast,\nChamomile and Green Tea, but here\nare some of the less well-known teas.\nGive them a try the next time you are\non the hunt for a new drink to keep\nyou warm this winter!\nNeed to stay awake?\nTranslated from Mandarin, its name\nactually means \u201cblack dragon\u201d.\nYou would normally drink Oolong\ntea during a meal of Dim Sum,\nbut don\u2019t let that stop you from\nhaving it at home! It is one of the\nmore caffeinated teas out there,\nhelping you revitalize your memory\nespecially if you are bogged down\nwith work.\nIt also helps boost your metabolism\n\u2013 maybe an added bonus after\nsnacking on some of those chocolate\nchip cookies in between revision\nsessions! Oolong tea can help aid\ndigestion, helping to reduce the onset\nof acid reflux or indigestion.\nGetting stressed and need\nsomething to help you relax?\nRooibos tea is a red tea from a South\nAfrican Red Bush. Due to its lack of\ncaffeine, it can be a good choice just\nbefore bed \u2013 especially with winter\nright round the corner. It contains\na wide range of antioxidants in the\nform of polyphenols, which can\nhelp the body fight free radicals.\nIt has also been found to relieve\nstomach ailments such as cramps and\nindigestion. Try this as an alternative\nto green tea if you prefer teas with a\nmore robust flavour.\nBlurred eyesight and\npersistent skin breakouts?\nFor that \u201ctake me to the spa RIGHT\nNOW\u201d vibe, try some lemongrass tea\n\u2013 I can assure you that it works! The\naroma of lemongrass just brings me\nback home to Thailand, where it is\ncommonly used to scent rooms.\nPlenty of spicy south-east Asian\ndishes (namely curries) also make\nuse of lemongrass, so it\u2019s everywhere!\nLemongrass contains Vitamin A,\nwhich is beneficial for eyesight and\nthe skin. It also contains citral, an\nantioxidant to protect your body\nagainst free radicals.\nDown with the flu?\nSecond only to chamomile as our\nFood Editor\u2019s herbal tea of choice!\nPeppermint tea can help relieve your\nsinuses and soothe the sore throats\nthat we tend to get around this time\nof the year.\nThe menthol in the tea can help act\nas a muscle relaxant especially after\nan intense workout or sports training\nsession. Also, you can have a cup if\nyou need to de-stress after a busy day\nat uni. It\u2019s traditionally seen as an\nenergizing brew.\nWant to start getting into\nthe Christmas mood?\nI know I do \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s December\nalready! Just brewing a cup of masala\nchai can make your house smell\nincredibly festive, what with all the\nspices. Originating from India, it is\nknown for being good for health and\nincreasing peace of mind.\nChai is actually the word for tea\nin many parts of the world; masala\nchai refers to the specific spiced\ndrink, but we tend to refer to it as\n\u201cchai\u201d as \u201cmasala chai\u201d seems to be a\nmouthful. (Every time you say \u201cchai\ntea\u201d, a tea-picker somewhere in the\nworld weeps.) It\u2019s based on a rich\nblack tea infused with all sorts of\nherbs and spices \u2013 such as ginger to\nhelp improve circulation and fight\nbloating; cardamom to detoxify\nthe body; cinnamon and clove with\nanti-inflammatory and antibacterial\nproperties; and finally, black pepper\nto give the tea an extra kick of\nspiciness which is found to improve\nour metabolism.\nRecipes have varied wildly since\ntraditional times, so of course\nthere\u2019s nothing stopping you from\nexperimenting with the spices you\nuse, and how much of each you put in\nyour brew. It is my favourite tea of all,\nespecially with the usual addition of\nmilk and sugar! Traditionally in India\nsome form of heavy milk is used \u2013 try\nevaporated milk in yours.\nA final note...\nOf course, no herbal infusion is a\nmiracle worker or a substitute for\nhealthy eating habits! These ones\nwe\u2019ve listed however are only the tip\nof the iceberg in that huge wonderful\nworld of teas out there, specialty or\notherwise. It\u2019s amazing how some of\nthem have been used for centuries as\ntraditional remedies, and that they\naren\u2019t necessarily just a luxury for the\nupper classes.\nSo the next time you\u2019re out for tea\nwith a friend or loved one, spice it up\na bit \u2013 try something new, expand\nyour palate\u2019s horizons a bit!\nFelix Food recommends...\nFound these suggestions interesting?

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 31\n05.12.2014\nFELIX\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAn Excavation of the Bloody Horrors of Warfare\nFred Fyles explores brutal photographs of wars gone by at the Tate Modern\n\"A brutal\nawakening\nof the\nhorrors of\nwar, and the\ndebilitating\neffect of\ntime gone\nby\"\n\u201cThere is an aggression implicit in\nevery use of the camera\u201d\n- Susan Sontag\nSince the dawn of the camera, the\nphotographer has returned to a\nnumber of themes: the beauty\nof nature, the danger of the streets,\nthe glamour of the rich and famous.\nAnd yet, there is one subject that\nhas captured the photographer\u2019s\nattention like none other: Conflict.\nFrom corpses piled high at BergenBelsen, to the tattered remnants of\nPalestinian homes, it seems that the\nspectacle of war has always struck\nhumanity as one worth observing.\nJust as light, filtered through a Leica\u2019s\naperture, permeates a strip of film,\nso to do these photographs strike our\nsenses and imprint themselves on our\nconsciousness.\nBut what of the aftermath? Does\ntime, that most potent of medicines,\nsurely has the power to heal all\nwounds? The answers can be found in\nthe Tate Modern\u2019s latest exhibition;\nentitled Conflict, Time, Photography,\nit aims to explore the lasting legacy\nof war. In an example of curatorial\nbrilliance, the Tate has arranged the\nphotos, not in terms of subject, or\ndate, but by length of time post-conflict. It does not resemble an art\ngallery so much as an archeological\ndig; with each room we permeate\ndeeper and deeper into our collective\nmemories, tunnelling through the\nstrata and unearthing bone-chilling\nbounties.\nIn the photos taken immediately\nafter conflict, what is most startling\nis not the horror of war, but rather\nthe stillness with which each photo\nis imbued. Luc Delahaye\u2019s photo of\nan ICD explosion in central Iraq is\nblanketed in a grey, muted silence;\nwe see the time before the dust has\nsettled, before the screams begin.\nSimilarly, Don McCullin\u2019s Shellshocked US Marine, Vietnam, has an\nunsettling calm about it; the soldier\nstares out, his eyes bulging out of his\nhead, through which no doubt the\nconflict that had been raging seconds\nbefore is now replaying. He does\nnot notice McCullin. He does not\nnotice the camera. He is blind to the\nworld, receptive only to his internal\ntorment.\nIn terms of scope, the Tate has\npulled out all the stops, exploring\nwars long gone and conflicts still\nraging. The message is clear; all war is\nhorrific, and it is all worth exploring.\nIn a year of overzealous politicians\nfocussing on the centenary of WWI,\nand an increasingly jingoistic attitude\nbeing taken towards how one should\ncommemorate those who died, it\nis refreshing to be reminded that\nconflict did not begin in 1914, and\ncertainly did not end with the Treaty\nof Versailles, despite the hopes of a\ncontinent in a post-war daze.\nSome of the works focuses on the\nmost obvious aspect of conflict:\nthe lasting legacy of ruination and\ndestruction it leaves behind. In\nthe months that followed WWI a\nnumber of guides to northern France\nwere published, allowing a crowd of\nhorror-tourists to satisfy their blood-lust; continuing in such a vein, we\nare presented with a series of photos\nsurveying the destruction wrought\nupon Riems, whose cathedral became\na symbol of French hope. Its nave is\nblasted, its statues crumbling, and\nyet the edifice still stands tall, not\nyet willing to become a victim of\nwar. In comparison, the damage left\nby the bombing of Dresden, levelled\nin a mere two days with a cost of\n25,000 lives, is harrowingly captured\nin Richard Peter\u2019s damning book\nDresden: A Camera Accuses, published\nin 1949.\nSuch images are not conceived as a\ncall to arms; they are not histrionic.\nThey do not scream their message\nfrom the rooftops, but instead softly\ndeliver an inescapable message: that\nwar is an inconceivable horror, and\nhumanity has an endless capacity for\nevil. Nowhere is this more apparent\nthat in the work of Shomei Tomatsu,\nwhose stunning black and white\nphotographs of Nagasaki twenty\nyears after the atomic blast form\nthe focus of the exhibition, both\nphysically and emotionally.\n\u2018Nakasaki\u2019, Tomatsu explains, \u2018Has\ntwo times; there is 11:02, August\n9th, 1945; and there is all the time\nsince then. And we must not forget\neither of them\u2019. This precise time is\ntaken from a broken watch, whose\nhands fused to the lens the moment\nof the blast; it looms out at us from\nthe print, its strap gone, its dial\nchipped, like a vast, unblinking eye.\nIts function is no longer to tell us\nthe time, but instead to allow us to\nremember and reflect on the horrors\nof the bomb. But Tomatsu documents\nanother time: the present. He looks\nat those who have grown up in the\nshadow of the bomb, taking dramatic,\nclose-cropped, unforgiving photos of\nthose who were injured, their keloid\nscars spreading like vast spider-webs\ndown their necks.\nElsewhere, the focus is on what is\nmissing, such as Emeric Lhuisset\u2019s\ntribute to murdered Iraqi journalist\nSardasht Osman, I Heard the First\nRing of my Death, or Taryn Simon\u2019s\ngenealogical studies performed in the\nwake of the Srebrenica Massacre, in\nwhich family trees are reconstructed,\nwith images of bones and teeth\nexhumed from mass graves replacing\npictures of those who were killed. In\nsuch work it is the space that remains\nunfilled that is examined; the empty\nchair, the shoes left behind.\nDiana Matar takes this theme and\napplies it to the Libyan Civil War, in\nher breathtaking series Evidence, in\nwhich she photographs sites of former\nhuman rights abuses. In each case the\nphotograph is accompanied by a short\ntext describing that particular crime;\nwe learn that these humble homes\nwere fired upon by invading forces,\nthat this billboard was put up in the\nwake of a public double-hanging. The\nmost powerful photo of hers is also\nthe smallest: a square photograph of\na calm sea, measuring about 15cm\nacross, into which the remains of\n1270 political prisoners were dumped\nafter their bones had been ground\ninto a fine powder. Matar uses her\ncamera as a tool for truth, uncovering\nwhat many people have tried hard to\nleave behind.\nA strange dichotomy exists within\nthe exhibition between the work\nthat is conceptual and that which\nis \u2013 essentially \u2013 photojournalism.\nIn some works the line blurs, such as\nin the multiple series looking at the\nbrutalist defences left behind by the\nGermans on the French coastline in\nWWII, but they never come across\nas more than a poor man\u2019s version of\nBernd and Hilla Becher. Ultimately,\n\"Tomatsu's\nphotographs\nof Nagasaki\nform the\nfocus of the\nexhibition,\nphysically\nand\nemotionally\"\nnothing can compare to the work of\nMcCullin and Tomatsu, whose photos\nneed no explanation; their impact is\nimmediately apparent. With their\ngrainy, black and white, seemingly\noff-the-cuff style, these works come\nthe closest to true photojournalism\n\u2013 indeed, McCullin is the only\njournalist included in the show \u2013 and\nperhaps it would have been nice if\nthe Tate had focussed more on such\nartists.\nNear the end of the exhibition we\nare shown work from Istory, a project\nfrom Syrian photographer Hrair\nSarkissian, in which he explored the\nsemi-public and private archives\nthat exist in Istanbul. With their\nminimal lighting, the photos have\nan oppressive quality that reflects\nthe confidential nature of the\nfiles contained within these vast\ncollections. The stories have been\nshut away, consigned to the filing\ncabinet of history, but Sarkissian\nexposes them, even momentarily, to\nthe light of day. And this is what the\nTate Modern achieves with Conflict,\nTime, Photography: a shockingly\nbrutal awakening of the horrors of\nwar, and the debilitating effect of\ntime going by.\nConflict, Time, Photography is on\nat the Tate Modern until 15th\nMarch\n2015. Tickets are \u00a313.10 adults; \u00a311.30\nStudents\nSteel Helmet with Skull Bone Fused by Atomic Bomb, Nagasaki 1963 Photo: Shomei Tomatsu\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\n05.12.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTrue Islamic Caliphate promotes peace, not terror\nThis year, the true face of\nIslamic Caliphate has been\nobscured by the smoke rising\nfrom Iraq. Kindled by the horrific\nactions of militant extremist group\nISIS, the conflict there has not only\nscorched the lands of Syria and\nIraq, but has left in cinders the very\nprinciples on which the extremists\nclaim to stand. True Caliphate is a\nspiritual leadership to promote peace,\nnot political leadership to impose\npower. Understanding how and why\nextremists twist Islam to meet their\nown ends is vital in the ongoing fight\nagainst extremism.\nA \u2018Caliph\u2019 is literally a \u2018successor.\u2019\nWhen the Prophet Muhammad died,\na system of Caliphate was established\nwhereby successors were elected to act\nas a spiritual leaders of the Muslim\ncommunity. This lasted around 30\nyears, after which internal divisions\nled to fractures within the Muslim\ncommunity that still survive to this\nday. Regardless, everyone is agreed \u2013\nanyone who claims to be an Islamic\nCaliph today is claiming to be a\nsuccessor of the Prophet Muhammad.\nWith that title comes certain\nconditions: conditions which the socalled Caliphate of ISIS certainly fail\nto meet.\nWhere to begin? Their compulsion\nin conversion directly violates\nnumerous teachings of the Qur\u2019an\nthat instruct Muslims to only\nconvey their message, and never\nforce it onto anyone (2:256; 18:29;\n10:99). Their aggressive territorial\nwarfare is strictly condemned in the\nQur\u2019an, which only allows defensive\nwarfare to safeguard the human\nrights of the innocent (22:39; 2:193).\nTheir butchering of the innocent is\nanathema to Islam, which regards\nthe murder of one innocent like\nthe murder of all mankind (5:33).\nTheir enslavement and treatment of\nwomen is the very inhumanity that\nIslam came to fix, declaring women\nto be spiritually equal to men, and\ncodifying the rights that are naturally\ntheirs (33:35; 39:6; 4:34; 2:228; 90:13).\nMuch more can be said, but their list\nof atrocities is sadly unending, unlike\nthis column.\nTo impartially study the life of\nthe Prophet and his Successors is to\nknow they were peaceful pioneers.\nThe Prophet Muhammad allowed\nChristians to pray in his Mosque\n- something no-one\u2019s expecting\nto happen in Iraq anytime soon.\nHis second Successor, Omar, once\ndeclined the offer of Christians to\npray in their Church, only out of fear\nthat misguided followers would one\nday seek to annex it. The difference\nbetween ISIS and Islam\u2019s early leaders\nis as stark as night and day.\nAs such, ISIS will no doubt die their\nown death, but not before causing\nmore misery for the people of Iraq.\nWhere to go from here then? In a\nrecent Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace\nSymposium attended by dignitaries\nand MPs, Mirza Masroor Ahmad,\nthe world\u2019s most widely followed\nCaliph, asked Western powers to\nreflect on ISIS\u2019s source of funding.\nAhmad remarked, \u201cit is quite obvious\nthat they are receiving the help\nand support of certain powers. This\ncould be direct support from very\noil-rich states or it could be other\nmajor powers covertly providing\nassistance.\u201d Radical ideology may be\nthe spark, but it needs oxygen to keep\non burning.\nUnfortunately for us students, we\ncan realistically do little to change\nthe pertinent political dimensions.\nBut we are by no means helpless;\nthrough educating ourselves about\nthe reality of Islam and Caliphate we\ncan collectively counter the pseudo-religious claims of extremists.\nUMAR NASSER\nCHAIR, IC AHMADIYYA MUSLIM\nSTUDENTS ASSOCIATION\nRest assured: religion teaches that\ntrue spiritual leadership is that which\ntakes us closer to our Creator. Those\nwho spread disorder amongst His\ncreation couldn\u2019t have gotten it more\nwrong.\nUmar Nasser discusses how to tackle Islamic extremism\nwww.felixonline.co.uk/survey\nIs your degree worth it?\nWe\u2019d love to hear what you\nthink \u2013 take part in our\nnew online survey, open\nuntil the end of term.\n\n"

For years, this had been the\nhome of White Heat, an indie night\nthat\u2019s seen the likes of The xx, Adele,\nLorde, and Horrors grace it\u2019s stage\nbefore they made it big, as well as\nbeing a favourite haunt of Imperial\u2019s\nown Alternative Music Society.\nThe council\u2019s decision was seen as\ninevitable by many, considering the\nplanned revamp of the whole area by\ndevelopers.\nHowever, the council maintains\nit was solely made on account of an\nincident on the 24th of October, when\nthe bouncers at Madame JoJo\u2019s and\nneighbouring Escape Bar attacked\na punter with baseball bats after a\nverbal altercation. The punter is\nalleged to have responded to initial\ninsults by throwing bottles at the door\nstaff after which they retaliated by\nwielding bats they kept in a bin bag on\nsite at Madame JoJo\u2019s.\nThe head of Westminster\u2019s licencing\ncommittee called it \u201can organised\nassault\u201d and Escape Bar\u2019s license was\nalso suspended. Despite the council\nsaying that they had taken evidence\nfrom several parties including the\npolice, fans of the club are convinced\nit was an inside job.\nSupporters have also pointed out\nthat this was an isolated incident\nand that the total revocation of its\nlicence conveniently coincides with\nthe planned regeneration of the area\nsurrounding Madame JoJo\u2019s. Soho\nEstates, that has now repossessed the\nclub, owns hundreds of millions of\npounds worth of property across the\nWest End and put in an application\nin September of last year to demolish\nthe buildings that currently stand\nin the vicinity. Permission was\ngranted, with local business owners\nand affiliates of the club nights run at\nMadame JoJo\u2019s dismissing it as part\nof an unwelcome \u2018blandification\u2019 of\nthe notoriously seedy, but quirky\nlocation.\nOn the 29th\nOctober various\npromoters and performers from\nthe venue\u2019s vast array of nights\nmarched from Soho Square to the\nheadquarters of Soho Estates in\nprotest. It didn\u2019t seem to achieve\nmuch and White Heat\u2019s Facebook\npage reported that no-one answered\nwhen they rang on the door of the\nproperty firm\u2019s office.\nSoho Estates owns the copyright\nto the name \u2018Madame JoJo\u2019s\u2019 and\na new club is expected to replace it\nafter redevelopment. As well as being\none of the few venues in the area to\nhave kept its seven-day-a-week 3am\nlicence, Madame JoJo\u2019s had, quite\npossibly, the widest variety of club\nnights in London.\nAs well as being home to White\nHeat every Tuesday for six years,\nit has a rich history of alternative\ncabaret, burlesque and jazz dating\nback from the 50s. At the news of its\nclosure, punters and promoters alike\nreflected on how suited and booted\nburlesque fans would share the dance\nfloor with the first arrivals for Free\nYour Soul, the weekly Afro House\nnight.\nDespite the fact that his company\nis ready to redevelopment the area\non which the club stands, many Soho\ndie-hards are grateful to infamous\nporn-baron Paul Raymond for\nbuying up large parts of the red-light\ndistrict in the 60s and essentially just\nleaving it alone. As well as having\nbeen one of the few unkempt sections\nof the West End left, the diversity\nof Madame JoJo\u2019s is unmatched. As\nwell as boasting a wealth of cabaret\nand drag shows, indie fans have been\nflocking to White Heat for years.\nWhere else could Dev Hynes of Blood\nOrange (but back then of Lightspeed\nChampion) been seen jamming out\nwith a baby-faced Alex Turner of The\nArctic Monkeys?\nSince Cheap$kates\u2019 home,\nMoonlighting, shut in September\nWhite Heat was probably the\nlast place in W1 where drinks\nwere still \u00a32.50 each. Grotty but\nfabulous, much like its clientele, one\nanonymous student recalled, \u201cI\u2019ve\nonly been there twice but both times I\nsaw penises\u201d.\nThe owners of Banquet Records\nin Kingston, who run New Slang, a\nsimilar indie night showcasing new\nbands, showed support for White\nHeat promoters Marcus Harris and\nMatty Hall, saying \u201cChances are New\nSlang wouldn\u2019t exist without White\nHeat. Good people doing a good\nnight. They\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nBut will they? The petition to save\nMadame JoJo\u2019s had nearly 8000\nsignatures at last count, but chances\nare this Soho haunt is gone for good.\nFor now, White Heat is being\nshared between The Lexington and\nElectrowerkz and hopefully its loyal\nfanbase and excellent track record\nwill mean it will find a permanent\nhome in the near future.\nPhoto: David Newbold\n\n"

The probe, the RoboUglyDuck launched\nmercifully without any noticeable hiccups yesterday\nand was able to carry out the desired science missions\nin Low Kerbin Orbit.\nUnlike previous missions where the idiotic Kerbals\ndid things like \u201clet go of the space craft whilst in space\u201d,\nthe robotically controlled drone was perfectly well be-haved. Unfortunately no one has invented solar panels\nyet, and since transmitting all its scientific data back\nto earth, the on board batteries have now died. The\nremains of RoboUglyDuck are the first chunk of what\npromises to be an exciting blanket of Kessler Syndrome\nspace junk that will no doubt soon envelop the planet.\n\"Overall,\nKickbeat is\na game that\nhad a lot of\npotential.\nSadly, the\nexecution\nleaves a\nlot to be\ndesired.\"\nKickbeat describes itself as \u201can\ninnovative rhythm game with\na kung fu theme, featuring\nfully 3D characters and high-energy\nmusic!\u201d Which sounds pretty good.\nThe reality is not quite as good as it\nseems at first.\nIn essence, Kickbeat is a classic\nfour-button rhythm game \u2013 at\nthe right time you press up, down,\nleft or right. Sometimes you need\nto press multiple buttons at once,\nsometimes you need to press and\nhold, and pressing space at any\npoint will activate your chi (I still\nhaven\u2019t worked out what this does,\nother than changing the background\ncolour).\nThe \u201cinnovative\u201d part of the game\ncomes from the way that the four\nbuttons are presented \u2013 as individual\nenemies circling you, readying for\nan attack. They\u2019re even helpfully\ncolour-coded as to what they\u2019re going\nto do! This is a pretty cool idea, in\ntheory, but combined with the full\n3D environments and characters it\ncauses the fatal flaw of this game.\nThere\u2019s just too much on the screen\nat any given moment. Even with\nthe colour coding, it\u2019s difficult to see\nthe important information because\nthe game is just throwing too much\nat you to be able to sift through\neverything for what you need. Which\nleads me to believe that actually,\nchi doesn\u2019t do anything other than\nchanging the background. It certainly\ntakes away a lot of the noise, and\nmakes the game far easier to play!\nIn addition to this, the powerup\nmechanic is nearly unusable.\nOccasionally, enemies will appear\nwith powerups over their head\n(which is pretty cool). In order to pick\nthem up, you need to double-tap\nthe correct button instead of single\ntapping it. Again, at first this seems\nokay, but then you realise that in\nany reasonably difficult song you\njust don\u2019t have the time to press that\nbutton twice before the next one\ncomes along! And in a difficult song,\nyou\u2019re going to mess up occasionally\n\u2013 this causes you to lose health and\nthe only way to regain it is these\npowerups. The powerup system\nsimply hasn\u2019t been thought through\nproperly, and really needs a complete\noverhaul to make it usable.\nAfter forming my opinion on the\ngame in general (and struggling to\nget through the first few missions\nbecause of the design flaws), I got a\nchance to try this with an Xbox 360\ncontroller. Throughout the game,\nthere are not-so-subtle hints that you\ncan use a controller instead of the\nkeyboard to play, so I figured it was\nworth a try.\nAnd oh my god it is so much better.\nSuddenly, my scores shot up. Instead\nof struggling to survive each mission,\nI\u2019m now working on getting that 5th\nstar, the information just becomes\nso much easier to sort through and\nthe game feels more responsive. The\nfact is, Kickbeat: Steam Edition is\njust not playable without a controller\n\u2013 which as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree is\npretty stupid.\nHowever, using a controller brings\na few new problems into the mix. The\nscreen no longer seems as busy, yes,\nbut picking up powerups becomes\neven harder. And remember those\nenemies that come simultaneously?\nGood luck with those on a controller\n\u2013 you\u2019re going to need multiple\nfingers on a set of buttons that have\nbeen designed for just your thumb.\nFinally, there\u2019s the cutscenes. Yes,\nthis is a rhythm game with a story.\nIt\u2019s utterly nonsensical (which is\nexpected and good!) but the voicing\nleaves a lot to be desired. This is\nclearly a game that needs to be\nvoiced, but when they don\u2019t bother\ngetting decent voice actors it\u2019s just\nannoying. I\u2019ve sat through all of the\ncutscenes so far (though they are\nskippable), and whilst the master is\nreasonable all of the other characters\ngrate a bit. It really lets the cutscenes\ndown \u2013 whilst the art is beautiful\nand fits perfectly, the story is fun\nand stupid, but then you get this\nreally bad voice acting that breaks\nthe best bit of the game. I would\nhave preferred that they just skipped\nvoicing it altogether, if this was the\nbest they could do.\nGoing back to the story, I love the\nridiculousness of it. It\u2019s a game where\nyou beat up guys using kung fu to\nmusic, a realistic storyline would\nhave been worse. Little things are still\na nuisance (why is all the music in\nthe world stored in one place? Why\nis a renowned martial artist teaching\na completely new technique based\nin America?), but overall the story\nso far gets a thumbs up from me \u2013\nespecially with the little lines here\nand there that mean that you just\ncan\u2019t help but laugh (\u201cDid they take\nall the songs? Even... Justin Beiber?\u201d).\nOverall, Kickbeat is a game that\nhad a lot of potential. Unfortunately,\nthe execution leaves a lot to be\ndesired. It could have been great but,\nsadly, it falls short.\nIf you think you want to give it a\ntry anyway, Kickbeat: Steam Edition\nis available for \u00a36.99 from Steam.\nPhoto: Kerbal Space Program, Matthew Allinson\nPhoto: Kerbal Space Program, Matthew Allinson\nBuoyed by the success of RoboUglyDuck and panicked by the fact we were about to run out of money,\nthe KSC decided to shoot for the moon. We loaded what\nwe thought would be enough fuel onto UglyDuck VI\nand put rookie pilot Doodlorf Kerman at the helm and\nblasted off. The plan had been to go for a free-return\nsling round the moon without landing on it. We hoped\nthis would get enough science and reputation to keep\nour funding up for the time being.\nUNFORTUNATELY this wasn\u2019t to be the case.

    "content": "46 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n05.12.2014\nSport Editor: Kunal Wagle\nEngland ended their autumn\ninternational campaign\nwith a 26-17 win against an\nAustralian team struggling for form\nin recent weeks. An estimated 82,000\nsupporters at Twickenham watched\nEngland exert their dominance in\nthe scrum leading to a brace of tries\nsplit either side of half time for\nnumber eight Ben Morgan. Australia\ndid sparkle at times and retaliated\nwith two tries of their own through\nFly Half Bernard Foley, who was\nsubstituted immediately after, and\nreplacement lock Will Skelton,\nalthough they conceded far more\npenalties during the 80 minutes.\nAfter exchanging penalties at the\nbeginning, England pushed ahead\nwith another three points from the\ntee as well as Morgan\u2019s first converted\ntry \u2013 the result of an Australian\nhandling error deep in their own 22.\nAnother Foley penalty meant that\nat the break the visitors trailed 13-6.\nAustralia emerged the brighter at\nthe beginning of the second half and\nmade light work of the home defence\nto score an emphatic try 5 minutes\nin. Having closed to within three\npoints, the game intensified although\nit was more errors in deep in their\nown territory that cost the Wallabies\na second try at the hands of Morgan.\nThey pushed hard for another try\nwhich duly came but were held off\nwith two more penalties from the\nboot of George Ford.\nEngland can take plenty of positives\naway from the match with good\nperformances put in across the\npitch. The forwards controlled the\ngame at set pieces and breakdowns\nas well as utilising the rolling maul\nwith devastating effect. George\nFord\u2019s open play kicking was much\nimproved. Having lacked purpose in\nprevious matches, all of his kicks put\npressure on the Australian defence\nand were the initiating step of both\ntries. The stand-out performers were\nMorgan for his two tries and control\nof the scrum and Courtney Lawes,\nwho produced try-saving tackles in\nboth halves before going off injured.\nThere is cause for concern as well.\nWhilst Australia would always prove\na greater challenge than last week\u2019s\nopponents, Samoa, the team they\nfielded looked wearied by a series\nof defeats and were certainly not on\na par with the other big southern\nhemisphere teams. The English\ndefence was unable to cope with the\nspeed and strength of the Australian\nbacks and would have conceded\nmore tries were it not for several\nhandling errors at crucial moments.\nIn contrast, England\u2019s back three\nplayed with little variety and were\ncompletely neutralised in attack and\nprovided little to no resistance when\ndefending. Jonny May, who scored\nthree tries this series, was reduced to a\ncameo appearance with a single carry\nin the first half while other winger\nAnthony Watson made only a few\nshort bursts in the second half.\nWhat have we learnt from the series\nas a whole? The England pack is not\nonly effective but consistently so.\nThey dissected Samoa and Australia\nwith ease and formed the basis of\nmost of the teams attacks. With the\nlikes of Alex Corbisiero and Dan\nCole returning from injury they will\nonly be stronger. George Ford is an\nemerging talent. This time last year\nAutumn Internationals: How far off are England\nfrom lifting the World Cup?\nHENRY LAMBLEY\nSPORTS WRITER\nOwen Farrell was making his mark at\n10 but has since fallen out of favour\nand with good reason. Ford has grown\nwith confidence over the Autumn\nand played well against the Wallabies\nalthough his place kicking will need\nto improve to make him top choice\nfor the Six Nations in February.\nThe backs need to improve their\nattacking game which lacked\nsufficient variation to fool the better\nteams. Jonny May shone with an\nindividual try against the All Blacks\nand added another two against Samoa\nbut was made to look as ordinary\nas the rest of them in the other\ntests. Mike Brown was especially\ndisappointing given his performance\nin recent tournaments. The whole\nteam lacks the intensity over 80\nminutes to secure the win. It was a\nseries long theme that showed that,\nwhether it was the second half against\nNew Zealand, the first half against\nSouth Africa or after scoring tries\nagainst Australia, they cannot afford\nto rest on their laurels against the best\nteams in the world because they will\nbe punished.\nLooking ahead to the World Cup\nnext September, England\u2019s prospects\nlook fairly good. While they only won\ntwo games in the Autumn series it\nwas not a complete disaster and the\nissues highlighted can be ironed out\nthrough the Six Nations and over\nthe summer when the coaches will\nhave more time to work with the\nplayers. It is not fanciful to believe\nthat they could win the competition\nand should certainly progress from\ntheir group judging by the current\nform of Australia. Players returning\nfrom injury will undoubtedly inject\nsome energy into the team as the\ncompetition for places intensifies and\nthe potential of Sam Burgess\u2019 move\nfrom League to Union could give the\nbacks that dynamism they have been\nsorely lacking.\nThe series was an opportunity for\nStuart Lancaster to bed in a relatively\ninexperienced team with a view to the\nWorld Cup and we will have to wait\nuntil then to find out if this tactic has\nbeen successful.\nEngland have undoubtedly stalled\nsince the Six Nations in the spring\nbut there is a clear path ahead to\nprosperity if the coaching staff\nare prepared to acknowledge the\nshortfalls of this current crop of\nplayers.\nLifting the Webb Ellis Cup in ten\nmonths\u2019 time may seem more a hope\nthan a likely outcome with the form\nof the favourites New Zealand but\nwith home advantage, all is still to\nplay for.\nBen Morgan scores a try for England in their 26-17 victory over Australia.

Said\nthe President: \u201cYes, I have watched\nthis sport once or twice on TV. Did I\nsign up? I guess if it says I did, then\nyes, I must have done. Why would\na petition feature names if they\ndidn\u2019t legitimately support what the\npetition was about?\u201d\nHangman also spoke to the natural\nallies of ACC Rugby, ICU Feminist\nSociety, who had also signed the\npetition with their club email. Said\nthe President, \u201cI have seen these\nboys drink in the Union once or\ntwice, and, to be honest, I think their\nlad culture is actually damaging in\nencouraging sexism at Imperial. But,\nif it says someone entered my login,\nthen I guess we do in fact support the\nteam.\u201d\nAlice Gast, Robert Winston and\nalso the CGCU Spanner have also\npenned their support of the team,\nAn unprecedented 15,000 students turn up to\nGeneral Meeting\nAGeneral Meeting was held\nthis week to discuss the state\nof commercial services at\nImperial, and approximately 15,000\nstudents turned up. The Meeting was\ncalled to discuss, in no particular\norder, the lack of air conditioning in\nthe library, the mice that are often\nspotted running around the cafes\non campus, having to pay to get into\nthe Union and, a point apparently\nthrown in for good measure \u201cThe\nImperial Ratio.\u201d\nThe number of students that\nturned up was unprecedented, and,\nas such, the Union had to set up\na number of live streams of the\ndiscussion across campus, with\nstudents willingly piling into lecture\ntheatres across campus on a Monday\nevening to have their say about the\nissues that truly mattered to them.\nWith a General Meeting only\nrequiring 200 students to meet\nquorum, the number of attendees in\nthis case meant quorum was met a\nrecord breaking 45 times over.\nThe discussion started at half seven\non Monday evening, and continued\nwell into the night as reasoned\ndebate turned into impassioned\ndeliberation. At 1am, armed services\nturned up to provide blankets,\nliquids and other supplies for the\nstudents who showed no sign of\ntiring in complaining about the heat\non Level 4, the hygiene of the library\ncaf\u00e9, and how one in five students\nstill leave Imperial as virgins.\nSaid one mathematics student sat\nin Blackett lecture theatre 1: \u201cI just\ndon\u2019t understand why the President\nof College spends so much money on\ngetting us stuff like flying robot labs\nor whatever but won\u2019t even pay for\nmore desk fans or anything.\n\u201cI literally have to take shower\nbreaks during revision in the\nsummer if I can only find a seat\non the 5th floor.\u201d Several hundred\npeople nodded in agreement, and\ntens of people were heard to cheer.\nA Biologist sat in the Great Hall,\nwhich had the discussion streamed\nthrough to a giant screen on stage,\nsaid: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is how every\nyear I vote in that guy who promises\nno more entry fees on a Friday, and\nyet every year I find myself paying\n\u00a32.50 to enter Metric and listen\nto some guy play a shitty itunes\nplaylist to an empty stage.\u201d Applause\nthen followed for a deafening ten\nminutes.\nMany were also congregated on\nQueen\u2019s Lawn, with another last\nminute projector displaying the\ndebate on the side of the Queen\u2019s\nTower.\nDuring a particularly robust\ndebate on point 222.1.6b, \u201cAll the\ndecent looking girls do Biology,\u201d\none EIE student said \u201cI wish I had\nbeen told that you actually have to\ndevelop interpersonal skills whilst\nat boarding school before coming to\nImperial.\n\u201cApparently demanding girls to\nmake me sandwiches and calling\nit banter doesn\u2019t really make girls\nfind you attractive, but it took me\nnearly all of first year to come that\nconclusion.\u201d A rare moment of\nsilence followed this statement, one\nof the few of the Meeting, as people\nseemed to quietly consider what he\nsaid.\nThe meeting finally came to the\nend Wednesday evening, as people\nslowly left lecture theatres, seminar\nrooms, cafes and meeting rooms\nand moved towards Beit Quad to\nqueue up for ACC Sports night. As\nthey were leaving, many spoke to\nHangman and said it was good to\nget the stuff that bothered them out\ninto the air like the whole entry fees\nthing, but one student did say \u201cIt is\n\u00a39.50 to get in, which is annoying,\nbut I guess we do get four pints.\u201d\nwith all their email logins appearing\non the petition. It also seems the ICT\nservice desk, the library complaints\nteam, those behind hiring the\nUnion minibuses and even Robert J.\nCarpenter have been moved by the\nplea to protect the rugby player, with\ntheir email logins present on the list.\nWhen Hangman contacted Tom\nWheeler, Imperial College Union\npresident, we asked him why he had\nboth signed the petition and also was\none on the panel that called for the\nmotion of no confidence in the first\nplace. He seemed perplexed, again\nunable to recall signing the petition\nwith both his personal login and the\npresidential account, but did say\nthat \u201cYou can\u2019t really argue with an\nautomated list like that, can you?\n\u201cI am not a fan of the petition as I\nthink the individual needs to accept\nthe consequences of his actions, but\nthen my name is on it twice so it\nmust mean I doubly support ACC\nRugby too.\n\u201cIt is confusing, as it now seems I\nsimultaneously disapprove and also\nhighly approve of the petition, but\nwhy would my name appear on it\ntwice if that wasn\u2019t the case? No-one\nwould dare troll such a sophisticated\nsign up system, would they?\nThe crowds also extended down Exhibition Road, as thousands showed up to the GM to make their voice heard\n\n"

The General Meeting,\nproposed by Imperial College Union\nCouncil member Andrew Tranter,\naimed to finalise the Union\u2019s stance\non education funding and formalise a\nHigher Education Funding Policy to\nreflect this.\nFor the meeting to make quorum,\n200 people need to show up within\nthe first half an hour of the meeting,\nall of whom could then vote on any\nproposed motions. Despite Council\nitself having 50 members, with only\n49 people turning up, no motion\ncould be passed and the policy will be\ntaken back to Council and discussed\nin next Tuesday\u2019s meeting. Only then\nwill the policy be finalised.\nDespite not meeting quorum,\ndiscussion surrounding fees carried\non for a further two hours, and the\nmeeting came to an end at around\n8.30 pm. Only one person was\nallegedly seen to be sleeping during\nthe entirety of the meeting.\nInitially it was decided by\nCouncil last academic year to hold a\nreferendum addressing four options\nfor funding education: for education\nto be free, for there to be a graduate\ntax, to pay tuition fees or none of the\nabove. However, this referendum was\nreplaced by the Higher Education\nFunding survey set and assessed\nby Alex Savell, the current Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services).\nTranter proposed in the last\nCouncil meeting that a General\nMeeting should be held to discuss the\nHigher Education Funding Policy,\nand come to a decision that hundreds\nof students could potentially all agree\nupon as opposed to Council deciding\nalone using the results of the survey.\nThe results were presented in the\nGeneral Meeting, despite not meeting\nquorum.\nTranter also introduced two papers\nto be considered at the meeting: one\nto install a policy supporting Free\nEducation (regardless of the survey\noutcomes), and another to introduce\nannual General Meetings, to be held\nin the second term of each year. Since\nthe Meeting failed to meet quorum,\nboth of these papers were not passed.\nDuring the meeting, Savell\nrecapped the results of the survey that\nclosed earlier last week. 310 students\nfilled in the survey, just under 2% of\nthe current student population. Out\nof those that completed the survey,\n87.7% were undergraduates.\nAlthough Free Education garnered\nthe most support, it wasn\u2019t by a large\nmajority; 140 students said Free\nEducation would be the funding\nmodel they would ultimately want,\nwhilst around 90 students said they\nwould prefer Tuition Fees. Just under\nthan 40 supported Graduate Tax, and\njust over 20 weren\u2019t a fan of any of the\nmodels.\nSavell\u2019s results were highly\ncomprehensive and looked at the\nsurvey responses from various\nstandpoints, showing the complexity\nof the student opinion concerning the\ndebate. Savell therefore proposed a\npolicy that instead of supporting one\nparticular line of funding, will look\nat several components of funding as a\nwhole instead.\nThis includes campaigning for\na regulation on Postgraduate and\nOverseas Fees, alongside campaigning\nfor a reduced privatisation of the\nHigher Education sector as a whole.\nIn terms of funding, Savell proposed\nthat the Union should campaign for\nreduced tuition fees, as \u201cthis is what\naligns best with the largest number\nof student views and appears to be\nantagonistic to the views of the fewest\nrespondents.\u201d\nPaul Beaumont, Union Council\nChair, was pleased with the meeting\nas a whole. He told Felix that \u201cWhilst\nnot quorate, the students who did\nattend engaged fully and it was\nbrilliant to hear their (wide ranging)\nviews. I think that because there is\nsuch a diversity of viewpoints on\nthis issue it is important we listen to\nthem all and then try and work out a\nstance that reflects that - this General\nMeeting went some way to achieving\nthat.\n\u201cIt looks like the new policy is going\nto take a middle-ground approach (as\nopposed to the previous one passed in\n2011), which will hopefully be more\ninclusive of the membership\u2019s views.\nThis can only be a good thing.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank those who came\nand got involved, and the DPFS for\nhis hard work on the initial proposals\nand ground work for the policy.\u201d\nPhoto: Philippa Skett\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"

Others who should not be\noverlooked but have a high chance\nof getting unjustly ignored are\nperformers whose films have not been\nseen widely. Chadwick Boseman (Get\nOn Up) is a revelation as James Brown,\nand Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler) is\nbrilliantly mad.\nBest Supporting Actor\nJ. K. Simmons (Whiplash) should\nbe in for a very clean sweep of every\nsingle Best Supporting Actor award\nthere is out there, for his ferocious\nturn as a ruthless jazz band conductor\nwho will stop at nothing to achieve\nthe absolute best from his students.\nEdward Norton (Birdman) is the\nmost likely candidate running\nfor distant second, veteran actors\nRobert Duvall (The Judge), Tom\nWilkinson (Selma) and Christoph\nWaltz (Big Eyes) are all gunning for\nspots, (this would mark Waltz\u2019s third\ntime in the category) and Duvall in\nparticular seems to be likely to get\nin on the race, given his success with\nthe Hollywood Film Awards earlier\nthis year. It has been awhile since the\nunderrated Ethan Hawke (Boyhood)\nhas scored a nomination, but his\nstrong supporting turn in what many\nargue as this 2014\u2019s best film, gives\nhim a big boost into the possibility of\na nomination. Another cast member\nof Foxcatcher receiving attention for\nthis performance is Mark Ruffalo,\nwho might just get squeezed out given\nhow much competition there is.\nBest Leading Actress\nJulianne Moore (Still Alice) can most\ncertainly expect nominations to start\nflooding in, given her wonderfully\nmeasured, masterful performance as\na linguistic professor with early-onset\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease. It is about time\nfor Moore to score some awards,\ngiven years of injustices of missing\nout on wins and nominations, and\nshe may as well start polishing up\non her acceptance speeches. Reese\nWitherspoon (Wild) for a while was\nthe frontrunner, displaying a strong,\nmoving performance in a film that is\nvery well-reviewed, Amy Adams (Big\nEyes) practically scores a deserving\nnomination in whatever serious\nrole she plays, and there is talk of\nBrit newcomer Felicity Jones (The\nTheory of Everything) also joining the\nmix. Hilary Swank (The Homesman)\nmay be a serious contender to the\nremaining space in her feminist\nWestern. Critics may be divided over\nthe quality of Gone Girl, but they are\nunanimous in praising Rosamund\nPike\u2019s frighteningly unforgettable\nperformance. Is there space for Essie\nDavis (The Babadook)? Possibly not.\nBest Supporting Actress\nHot off her New York Film Critics\u2019\nBest Supporting Actress win, it is full\nsteam ahead for Patricia Arquette\n(Boyhood) in her quest to win her\nfirst Oscar. She has had success on\ntelevision, and is now displaying her\ntalent returning to the big screen.\nKeira Knightley (The Imitation\nGame) has won rave reviews for her\nwarm, tender performance opposite\nCumberbatch. A part of what made\nWild special was the presence of\nLaura Dern providing excellent\nsupport for Witherspoon as the\ncharacter\u2019s mother, and everyone\nseems to have picked up on this,\ngiven the buzz surrounding her\ncontribution to the film. It wouldn\u2019t\nbe Oscar season without the mention\nof Meryl Streep\u2019s (Into the Woods)\nname, and her latest musical\neffort might help her score her 19th\nnomination. That\u2019s right. 19th\n. Emma\nStone (Birdman) could be looking\nat a first-ever nomination in a film\nloved by pretty much everyone, and\nif anyone was looking for an acting\nnomination with Interstellar, Jessica\nChastain could be the one.\nPhoto: chrisreedfilm.com\n\n"

During a welcome\nspeech, President Gast remarked that\nsupport for university education had\nnever been more important than\nnow, placing an emphasis on the need\nfor people to be able to problem-solve\nand think critically to address the\ndynamic problems we face today. She\nsaid: \u2018Today\u2019s world demands new\nleaders, critical thinkers, fresh ways\nof approaching persistent problems,\nand innovative ways of handling the\nnew problems that arise. This is what\nwe do here at Imperial \u2013 we develop\nthinkers and leaders, we extend\nknowledge and develop solutions.\nAnd we can do all this only because of\nyour continued support \u2013 the support\nof our donors.\u201d\nThe President\u2019s Scholar, 4th year\nphysicist Oliver Clipsham, also spoke\nof the benefits of the scholarship\nscheme at the event. He said: \u201cOn\nbehalf of myself and all the scholars\nhere at Imperial, I would like to offer\nmy heartfelt thanks that you have\ndonated to ensure that more students\nmay go on to have a similarly\nwonderful experience.\u201d\nThe event also saw the launch of\nthe 1907 Circle, which recognises the\npeople and organisations who donate\n\u00a35,000 or more to Imperial.

Last month,\nmore than 80 people joined the Circle.\nThe evening saw the Queen\u2019s\nTower Rooms transformed into an\nexhibition hall, with interactive\nstands presenting information about\nthe cutting-edge research taking place\nat Imperial.\nAlumni from around the world\ndescended on campus to attend the\nevent. Dr. Michael McCann, who did\na PhD in Electrical Engineering at\nImperial in 1963, visited from the\nUS. He has supported scholarships\nat the College for a long time, and\nhis motivation for donating stems\nfrom the importance of education in\nbuilding a successful career.\nHe said \u2018My PhD has been\nthe key to everything I\u2019ve done\nprofessionally.\u201d\nCharity Week raises in excess of \u00a380,000\nCharity Week, a fundraising\nevent ran by Imperial College\nUnion Islamic Society (iSoc)\nearlier this month, managed to raise\n\u00a383,401.70, breaking all previous\nrecords the club held.\nThe week, spanning from the 29th\nNovember, included a black tie\ndinner; an auction; an intersociety\nquiz; a girls-only pampering and\nfashion day; volunteers trekking up\nSnowdon; and an inter-uni football\ncompetition. iSoc also ran daily\ncupcake and doughnut stalls across\ncampus, and door to door bucket\ncollections.\nThe auction alone raised \u00a330,000;\none rainbow cake baked by fifth year\nMedic Junaid Masud was sold for\n\u00a33,800 after a bidding war between\nmembers of the iSoc committee and\nthe Muslim Medics Society. After\ndriving the price so high, the two\ngroups decided to group together\nand pay in total, making this cake\npotentially the most expensive cake\never bought (allegedly).\nThe finale of the week was a talk\nby Dr Yasir Qadhi, which was held in\nthe Great Hall. Tickets were sold for\n\u00a320 each, and the event made a profit\nof \u00a315,000, which was all donated to\ncharity.\nCharity Week is not unique to\nImperial; many Universities across\nthe world run events too.\nThe international total for Charity\nWeek was \u00a3732,571.47, and this will\nbe donated to various projects that\nthe volunteers will have a chance to\nvote for.\nPresident of Islamic Society,\nIbtesham Hossain, said that:\n\u201cCharity Week never fails to get\neveryone together, the money\nraised is astonishing, the work put\nin is astonishing and the reward is\nastonishing.\n\u201cI genuinely believe we are only\njust scratching the surface in terms\nof what we can achieve through this\ncampaign; the potential of each and\nevery volunteer has no limits and, for\nthis reason, Charity Week at Imperial\nwill continue to prosper\u201d.\nAlex Savell, Deputy President\n(Finance & Services), said: \u201cWe\nare incredibly proud of all the\nachievements our many clubs\nand societies make, but Islamic\nSociety have really done something\nincredible this year.\n\u201cSitting in our office, we\u2019ve seen\nhow diligently and enthusiastically\nthey\u2019ve been working towards this\nand I\u2019m personally extremely happy\nfor them that it\u2019s paid off in such a\nspectacular way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant that a society here are\nraising and giving such a large sum to\nsuch a good cause.\n\u201cI hope student organisations at\nImperial College Union and all other\ninstitutions continue to do such good\ndeeds\u201d.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nCECILE BORKHATARIA\nNEWS REPORTER\nPhoto: Imperial College London\nThis cake was sold for more money than you probably will have in your account for another few years\nPhoto Credit: iSoc\n\n"

If the vote of no\nconfidence is passed, he will be\nrelinquished of his role of Club\nCaptain, and an election will take\nplace to find his replacement.\nThis follows the incidents Felix\nreported on in November when\nrugby players were seen stripping\non tube platforms after returning\nfrom a match on the 29th October.\nThe disruption caused by the players\nresulted in a district line tube service\nbeing suspended. Passengers were\ntold to disembark from the train at\nRavenscourt Park station after being\ntold that there was a \u201csignal failure\u201d.\nThe individual players involved\nare now under investigation by the\nBritish Transport Police, who have\nfootage of them drinking from\nbottles of wine on the tube and being\ncompletely naked on several tube\nstation platforms.\nThe motion of No Confidence\nwill be presented to the members\nof Union Council, and only those\nthat hold a seat on Council will\nbe able to vote for or against it. It\nis being brought against Hobson\nas he allegedly lied during the\ninvestigation into what exactly\nhappened on the tube. The motion\nof No Confidence was one of the\nsanctions decided upon by the\nGovernance Committee of the\nUnion, which includes members of\nthe Trustee board.\nThe other sanctions included a\nclub-wide two-week suspension for\nICURFC, a suspension from the club\nfor those on the match sheet of the\nday of the incident until the end of\nthe year, and for those on the match\nsheet to also undertake community\nservice.\nThe Athletics Clubs Committee\n(ACC) held a meeting last week,\nwhere the members of committee\npresent unanimously voted to\nsupport Hobson, despite the reasons\nbehind calling for the vote of\nNo Confidence. This will also be\npresented to Council at the meeting.\nIn an email to Presidents, Club\nCaptains and Club Chairs that\nare overseen by the ACC, Oliver\nBenton, ACC Chair, details how the\nmembers of the committee voted\nto \u201csupport [Hobson] through this\nvote of no confidence\u201d alongside\nthe distribution of the petition,\nwhich is garnering support from a\ndiverse range of students including\nthose not involved with ACC. Many\nother clubs have also distributed the\npetition to their respective mailing\nlists.\nThe email also lists how the\nACC believes that \u201c[Hobson] acted\nwith the best interests of his Club\nmembers at heart.\u201d The email also\nnotes that the team has \u201calready\nbeen punished by the Union as a club\nand as a team\u201d.\nIt has also been suggested that\nmany sports teams will be showing\nup at the Council meeting in a show\nof solidarity for Hobson, although\nthey will not be able to vote on the\nmotion.\nTom Wheeler, Imperial College\nUnion President, said in regards to\nthe petition: \u201cThe reason for [the\nmotion of No Confidence] is that the\nClub Captain lied repeatedly to both\nmyself (as part of the investigation\nPhoto: Felix\nthat I was carrying out on behalf of\nthe Governance Committee) and\nthe College Tutors. These mistruths\nwere only brought to light when the\nBritish Transport Police corrected\nus (with the backing of witness\nstatements and CCTV footage).\n\u201cThe fact that this dishonesty\nis not given as the reason for the\nmotion of no confidence in the\nonline ICURFC Petition indicates\nthat the only reason for the petition\nis the belief that the Club Captain\nwas acting in the best interests of\nthe Club and its members, however,\nby acting in a dishonest manner the\nClub Captain achieved the opposite.\u201d\n\"The\nmotion...\nwas one\nof the\nsanctions\ndecided\nupon\"\nTom\nWheeler:\n\"The\nreason...\nis that\nthe club\ncaptain lied\nrepeatedly\"\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"
