    "content": "Reviews\nA Common\nWoman\nBy Davio Fo, Franca Rame,\nperformed by Gillian Hanna at the\nHalf Moon Theatre, Mile End\nRoad.\nThe title is misleading in that this is\na compilation of three monologues\nperformed soley by Gillian Hanna\n(of the all-female ' Monstrous Regiment' Theatre Group).\n'Bless me Father for I have\nsinned', was originally set in Italy\nwhen the Red Brigade were\nrampaging. One translation to\nEnglish the comparable setting was\nconsidered to be the Republic of\nIreland just after the heyday of\nflower power. For this play let the\ntheatre was filled with incense, as\nit took place in a church in the form\nof a confessional with a priest. The\nconfessor was a fifty year old hippy.\nHer story was a moving one of\nimperfect motherly love, and how\nshe came to be a hippy. The\nportrayal of this mature woman\nsitting cross-legged on the church\nfloor recounting how she got high\non hooch, is extremely funny. It is\nalso touching, though the\nintroduction of politics (the author\nwrote Accidental Death of an\nAnarchist) is somewhat clumsy and\ncompletely unnecessary.\nThe Rape is so tense and so\ninvolving that for the duration of the\nmonologue it seems that the only\nobject to have even existed was the\nhumiliated and downtrodden woman sitting on the chair. She is\nan English woman of indeterminate\nage who recounts her experience\nwithout any running about, unlike\nthe other monologues. Franca\nRame, who wrote this, was herself\nraped, and the intensity of\nautobiography shows through in the detail of the account. 'I wanted\nto drown the chaos in my head' to\nthe 'sperm trickling down my legs'\nshow powerfully the humiliation\nand degradation at the hands of\nthose men, and the terror of further\nhumiliation at the hands of the\npolice.\nIn Coming Home Gillian Hanna\nplays a truly 'common woman' in\nthe old English snobby sense. She\nis in her late twenties and lives in\na council house. In a fit of severe\nfrustration with her bus band, she\ngoes ot to find herself some love to\nassuage her passion. There is a wonderful bed scene in which she\nleaps about with a pillow pretending it's the man she's been\nShort\nCircuit 2\nShort Circuit was a cinema hit about\nthree years ago. It was all about a cute little robot in the big bad world,\nwith the intelligence and self-awareness of a QM C student\ncourtesy of a handy lightning bolt.\nIn the sequel, one of the designers\nof the robot, Number Five, gets\ntotally hacked off with making\nweapons and goes off to New York\nto make and sell toy Number Fives.\nHe lands a big contract to build 1000\nin time for Christmas so he calls in\nthe real Number Five to help out.\nAll this is complicated by a jewel\nrobbery sub-plot foiled by our alloy\nfriend. (Perhaps the toy robots are\nthe sub-plot, I don't know.)\nBasically the film is a mixture of\nplots and characters from other\nfilms, so badly put together you can\nalmost see the joins. The star,\nNumber Five seems to be a cute\nmetalic ET with a funny voice and\nreminiscent of Crocodile Dundee in\nthe big city for the first time.\nThe character of the robot\ndesigner is Indian, and is played by\na made-up white American actor in\nsuch a patronising and clich ed way\nthat some people might find the film\noffensive, just like Peter Sellers in\nThe Party but without the comic\ngenius of Sellers. There is an inevitable romantic interlude in which Ben, the Indian designer is\nhelped out by Number Five (just like\nRoxanne).\nIn Hollywood today, true\noriginality is rare and precious, but\nin this film the plagiarism is almost\npainfully obvious. There are good\nmoments but these are not all that\nfrequent and many of the jokes have\nbeen seen before.\nWhen all said and done this is a tolerable 90 minutes of mis entertainment, more suited to video\nthan the cinema.\nMike Morton.\nwith that day. The man in question\nshe describes as being 'not quite\nsure if he'sAC or DC. This is a comedy\u2014a bit of a jolt\nafter the deadly serious play\npreceding it\u2014with a French farce\ntwist at the end.\nThe unifying idea behind these\nmonologues is to give a bit more\njuice to the feminist cause, although\nnot militantly, by showing the\nwoman's point of view.\nThe theatre is close to Stepney\nGreen tube and is a horrible breeze-block barn. Phone 790 4000 for\ninformation.\nAdam.\nSalaam\nBombay\nSalaam Bombay, released in Britian a couple of weeks ago must be\nacknowledged as a masterful\naccomplishment of cinematography.\nMira Nair in her directorial debut of\na feature has enchantingly captured\nthe emotions, the comradeship and\nsuffering of Bombay' s street\nurchins. No aspect of the street life\nis left untouched as the story follows\nthe central character, Chaipau,\nthrough his existence in a maze of\nprostitution, pimps and peddling.\nThis film is a tribute to human\nresilience in an environment where\nyou are your only friend. Mira has\nused the camera with finesse,\nleaving one with lingering images\nsuch as when a young girl is shown\nscratching on the window of her\nmother's bedroom like an alley cat\nwhile watching her mother 'work'\nwith a client. The film is a triumph\nbecause, ultimately, it is a tribute to\nhuman nature, for it shows that\neven in bleak circumstances the\nstreet urchins show occasions of the\nnoble sentiments of love and care for\nothers even though their own survival is uncertain. The film ends\nwith Chai pau sobbing uncontrollably\u2014he is fated to lead\na life of misery.\nThis is not a film that will make\nyou cry. It is a masterpiece that will\nmake you admire the beauty of film\nfor capturing human behaviour of\nits worst and best amid the colour\nof the streets of Bombay. Salaam\nBombay is an international success\nwinning the Camera d 'Or award at\nCannes. Even though the dialogue\nis not in English (the subtitles\nshowed good translation) this will\nnot detract from the enjoyment of\na film where the images are of the\nforemost importance.\nDo not miss this powerful treat,\nwhich is also helping to raise money\nfor the rehabilitation of Bombay's street urchins.\nYishu Nanda.\nDue to the lack of space this week,\na number of reviews could not be\naccommodated. We apologise to the\nreviewers concerned and hope to\ninclude their material next week. We\nwill also have reviews of the final\nthree plays in the War of the Roses\nseries.\nPage 10 FELIX February 17 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nDemocracy\nDear Sir,\nAfter attending the unusual U GM in the JCR\non Tuesday January 31, I feel that the case for\namending the constitution was not presented\nproperly. It is true that this lack of discussion\nstemmed from a perfectly legal proceed ural motion, but the fact that this mechanism was\nused rather suggests that it is time to amend the\nrules and regulations, while preserving\ndemocracy.\nWhat an emotive word, democracy. Many will\nargue that the meeting was democratic, but\nexamination of the result provides interesting\nstatistics. Of the 240 or so who supported the\nmotion most of those were from St Mary's( total\npopulation 500), thus approximately, 45% of St\nMary's voted for the motion, against 340 IC\nstudents (population 5,000) or 7% of IC. When\nyou introduce the factor that only 300 or so\nstudents are ever available at one time due to\ncourse commitments, that 45% takes a greater\nsignificance.\nHerein the problem lies. No wonder St Mary's do not believe the present system is fair for all.\nThe conduct of the U GM provides much evidence\nto support the motion. I was a little surprised that\nthe motion was voted upon with no discussion.\nThe reasons for the procedural motion became\nobvious: when all those IC students had voted,\nthey left to go to lectures before the results had\nbeen announced. That suggests to me a lack of\nconcern or understanding of the issues involved.\nSt Mary's students gave up an average of two\nlectures to attend the meeting. On the proviso\nthat IC Union is available to all, then UG M's cannot be held during College hours, as St Mary's students will be discriminated against.\nOne also has to remember that over half the\nstudents at St Mary's do not have a formal lecture\ncourse, and learn by working in the various\nhospitals in London and the South East with no\nregular hours. If I am 'on take', that is working\nall day and night, how can I be represented at\nan ICU U GM? This difference in the working\npractice of medical students must be appreciated\nalong with differences in social activity, by those\nwho make policy at IC. As this rests at the\nmoment, the U GM makes policy, and I have at otl a lack of confidence in that body.\nI strongly feel that if an issue central to St\nMary's were debated we would come off the\nlosers on the majority of occasions. Ask the\nstudents at St Mary's who have attended\nuniversity previously about the difference in the\nneeds, atmosphere, etc and they will all agree.\nI firmly believe that ICU at present is not\nequipped or willing to consider St Mary's fairly.\nThe lack of discussion effectively glossed over\nthe fact that student accountability will not be\nlost. The three individual colleges would take\nback much responsibility for policy decisions with\nregards to external affairs etc, and then the\nrepresentative would be mandated to argue the\nagreed line at the ICU meetings. This change\nwould enable more people to involve themselves\nin Union meetings rather than the five or six who\nmanaged to dominate the U GM on January 31.\nThis I find annoying as I was prevented from\nspeaking by the mechanism of the situation. It\nwas also pertinent that no one from St Mary's explained the situation as we see it, this much\nof the reasoning was lost. We were equal\nmembers at the U GM, with the universal rights\nthat were referred to so often in the other\nbusiness at the assembly. Those right's we did not\nreceive.\nIn conclusion I am not crying foul or feel the\ndesire for revenge. I am deeply saddened and\ndisturbed at what transpired last Tuesday, with\na total lack of confidence in the U GM as it stands.\nI hope people will take a little time to listen to\nall angles of the debate in the future, as St Mary's. students willing, integration into ICU would\nbenefit IC immensely. St Mary's is a world leader\nin what it does, enjoying a level of public\nawareness equal to that of IC. That is a powerful\ntool to be used once the integration has taken\nplace. At the moment St Mary's is doing all the\ngiving. In the best agreements one reaches a compromise, isn't it time IC gave a little?\nWilliam Lumb,\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School.\nImperial College Union\nDear Bill,\nThe above letter was pinned on most lockers\naround the IC Union Building this week.\nHowever, it does contain a few factual\ninaccuracies. Firstly, the key was left with\nsecurity, who lost it. Secondly, Chas Brereton is\nin charge of IC Buildings and he hands out the\nkeys\u2014it is his responsibility to keep back-up\ncopies. Thirdly, and most typically, is that since\nthe keys were lost on January 221989 by security,\nhe has managed to handle the situation with total\ninefficiency. We left the key numbers and company with him, and he promised either new\ncopies and/or to contact us. He has still not done\nanything after three weeks, even though we have\nvisited him continuously asking for help. It has\nnow come to the point where we will have to go\nto personal expense to hire a locksmith etc. This\nshould be the Union's job, not ours.\nIC Kung Fu Club.\nAmi Jewish\nDear Bill,\nI would like to express my concern over certain\nchildish individuals at this College. A large\nnumber of Jewish Society posters received\npersonal attention, and messages like 'Fuck the\nJews' were the result, in addition to posters being\ntorn or burnt. Similar treatment was given to\nWellsoc posters.\nThis action was not particularly constructive in\nany sense of the word, but perhaps if the\nauthor(s) would like to make their opinion public\nin FELIX, then we will treat them as mature\nadults and act accordingly. In the meantime,\npeople have been offended and inconvenienced\nby this pathetic and cowardly act.\nAlternatively, I am willing to listen to any\ngrievances personally,\nS Parkus, Mat Sci 2.\nUGM's again\nDear Editor,\nAt 10.30am on January 31, I made my way\ndown to the Medical School Restaurant for a coffee. Amongst the usual rubbish on the table\na freshly photocopied letter from the St Mary's Student Union caught my eye. The letter\nconcerned a vote that was taking place on that\nvery same day at aUG M to be held at Imperial\nCollege starting at 1.00pm. The vote was to\ndecide whether decisions about all student union\nmatters (the Mary's clubs, bar, etc) should be\ntaken ,\u00bbi the UG Ms held at IC. These meetings\nare almost exclusively attended by students based\nat the site south of the park. The other option,\nas outlined by the working party, was that the\nformat of the UG Ms should be changed so that\na decision concerning St Mary's would be voted\non at anU GM at Mary's and then a representative from St Mary's would have a block\nvote at the next meeting held at Imperial thus\nrepresenting the views of the majority of St\nMary's students without them having to be there\nin person.\nThe word quickly spread through the Medical\nSchool that, although given the very short notice,\nit was imperative that as many of us as possible\nwent to the U GM and tried to stop this vote going\nthrough. Two hundred and fifty students made\ntheir way across the park (which incidentally,\neveryone agreed, took 30 minutes on foot) to\narrive at Imperial at 1.00pm. On the way to the\nJCR we were met by provocative posters saying\n' U GM1.00 pm, issues include The End of UG Ms', obviously aimed at stirring a biased, intransigent\ncrowd, determined on maintenance of the status\nquo, along to the meeting.\nWhen we all got to the JCR we were told that\nthe vote in which we were all inters ted in was\nIssue F, the last on the agenda. Realising that our.\nissue was not going to be on for at least an hour,\nmy heart began to sink as 1 watched the U GM 'in action' working through the first five issues.\nThe room contained a large number of social\nmisfits who, for the want of something better to\ndo, seemed to delight in the use of a term, which\nover the space of the next hour and a half I was\nto grow to hate\u2014The Procedural Motion.\nThis was bandied about for everything from\nRequest for Information to Request to go to the\ntoilet (well, not quite, but with as nearly a great\na frequency).\nFinally, just after 2.00pm it was time for our\nissue. The following account outlines a few of the\ndevious 'democratic' tactics used leading up to\nthe vote. Firstly, the motion was changed from,\nin outline, UG Ms are fair and representative\nmeetings (which the St Mary's students were\nagainst) to UG Ms should be abolished (which St\nMary's students were for).\nSecondly, an IC student suggested that the\nissue was too large and should not be voted on\nbut considered at another meeting. This,\nfortunately, was voted against as the IC Union\nsaid that enough work and discussion had already been put in by the working party. This\nwas lucky as nowhere near as many St Mary's students would have attended a second meeting.\nA sensible proposal was put forward to discuss\nPage 2 FELIX February 17 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nSCIENCE\nw Input!\nLadies, Gentlemen and yet more\ngentlemen of Imperial College,\nFELIX is proud to announce the\nreappearance of the Science Page.\nThis week we present a peculiar\narticle on strange matter. To come:\nHolography and Optical Computing\nand an explosive article on Chernobyl. This, however, may be\nwhere we have to stop. A page like\nthis, in a college like this should be\nbursting with articles on a myriad of\nsubjects from aeronautics to\nzoology.\nIf you are a researcher convinced\nthat your latest project will be the\ngreatest leap forward this century,\nor if you are a humble undergraduate with a pet subject, I want to hear from you. I do not\nwant this page to sink without trace\nbeneath the boundless reserves of\napathy for which IC is renowned.\nSurely not every person in college\nwants to become an accountant or\nIndSoc chair. Somewhere, buried\ndeep in some forgotten corner of\nsome forgotten lab there is someone\nwith a genuine enthusiasm for his\nsubject. Professors, PhDs, BEngs,\nBScs, MDs, undergrads, lab techs get your pencils out and write. This\nis a broad church: articles on\nsubjects such a science and politics,\nscience and philosophy, science,\ndrugs and rock and roll will all be\nwelcome.\nA few ideas to get you started. Last\nweek's FELIX carried a feature\n.proclaiming creation superior to\nevolution as a theory. For God's sake, to coin a phrase, will some\ndevout evolutionist reply? A few\nweeks ago, a former union president advocated closing much of\nthe royal college of science. Let the\nvoices of the scientists be heard.\nIf you have a written article, or just\na few spare ideas, I will be delighted\nto hear from you. Pop into the office\nany lunchtime or evening or leave\na note in the Science Editor's pigeon\nhole. Remember, the Lab Book is\nmightier than the sword.\nIt is as dense as an atomic nucleus but several thousand times the\nsize. It can devour matter and we may soon be able to make it. It is,\nas Simon Bradshaw explains 'Strange Matter.'\nSomething strange\nImagine a form of matter so dense\nthat a speck big enough to see\nwould weigh millions of tonnes. A form of matter that eats normal\nmatter releasing incredible amounts\nof energy. A form of matter that\ncould have a dramatic impact on science and technology. Soon\nperhaps you won't have to imagine\nit, because several theoretical\nphysicists seriously think that they\ncan make it.\nWhat we are talking about is\nstrange matter. Its name comes not\nfrom its unusual properties but\nrather because it contains so-called\n'strange quarks'. But what exactly\nis a quark and why are some types\nstranger than others?\nMatter is made of atoms, and\natoms are made of electrons\nsurrounding a nucleus. The nucleus\nis made of heavy particles called\"\nprotons and neutrons, and if you\nleft physics at O or A level that is\nlikely to be as far in as you got.\nPhysicists are now fairly confident\nthat they know something of the\nstructure of these particles; they\nbelieve them to be made of even\nmore fundamental particles called\nquarks (after a reference in James\nJoyce's Finnegan's Wake). Current\ntheory calls for six quarks, dubbed\nUp, Down, Charm, Strange, Top\nand Bottom. They all have either 2/3\nor -1/3 of the charge of a proton,\nin contrast to normal subatomic\nparticles which have whole number\ncharges (e.g a proton has +1 charge,\nan electron has -1 charge).\nA proton is thought to be made up\nof two Ups and a Down, whilst\na neutron would be two Downs and\nan Up. Since matter is mainly\nprotons or neutrons (electrons do\nnot contain quarks) then it is mainly\nmade up of Up and Down quarks.\nBut there are other quarks available,\nand they could well have a hand\ntoo.\nUp and Down quarks like to\ncongregate in threes as described. A large drop of Up and Down quarks\nwould normally be unstable. If\nthough some Strange quarks are\nadded then the drop becomes more\nstable. A couple of years ago it was\nsuggested that drops with masses of\nmore than a few protons, made up\nof equal numbers of Up, Down and\nStrange quarks, could be totally\nstable. The droplet would appear to\nbe a large atomic nucleus, except\nthat whereas atomic nuclei become\nmore unstable the larger they grow\n(so heavy elements like uranium are\nradioactive because their oversize\nnuclei fall to bits), strange matter\ndrops are stable no matter how big\nthey become. Because a lump of\nstrange matter behaves like a giant\natomic nucleus, it is very, very\ndense. A lump the mass of the sun\nwould be only a few miles across.\nStrange matter has another\nintriguing property though. It eats\nnormal matter. Protons are easily\nabsorbed, but absorbing a neutron\nreleases immense quantities of\nenergy) effectively what you would\nget by converting the neutron totally\nto energy(E=mc2 strikes again).\nSince over 50% of ordinary matter\nis made up of neutrons, if you feed\nsome to strange matter then over\nhalf of it will be converted to energy.\nAt this rate about ten kilos of\nordinary matter (of any sort!) would\nprovide as much energy as the\ntypical nuclear plant does in a year.\nIf strange matter is so dense, how\ndo you hold on to it? Fortunately\nthis problem is easily solved.\nStrange matter eats both protons\nand neutrons, but whilst neutrons\nare neutral, protons are positively\ncharged. Hence after eating\nordinary matter, a drop of strange\nmatter becomes positively charged\nand can be held in place by an\nelectric field. This also explains why\na lump of strange matter, if\ndropped, would not devour the\nwhole Earth. The more it absorbed,\nthe more positively charged it would\nbecome, until soon it would repel\nordinary atomic nuclei pushing it\naside. If a strange matter drop\nwas being used as a power source,\nit would have to have its positive\ncharge periodically reduced otherwise it would develop the subatomic equivalent of constipation.\nFair enough, but where do you get your strange matter? Attempts\nto look for naturally occurring\ndroplets have been unsuccessful,\nbut an Oxford physicist, Richard\nDa litz, together with other\nphysicists from California university\nat Irvine, thinks that it should be\npossible to use the particle\naccelerates at CERN in Geneva to\nproduce tiny droplets of strange\nmatter. These would be passed\nthrough tanks of liquid hydrogen\n(which contain large numbers of\nprotons) to grow them to a stable\nmass (several thousand times that\nof a proton). The strange matter\ndrop resulting from this would be\nheld in a containment field and\nslowly fed matter to absorb. As it\ndid so it would release intense\ngamma radiation which would be\nabsorbed by shielding, heating it up\nin the process. Free heat, and free\nenergy.\nIf strange matter really can exist,\nand if it can be made in the\nlaboratory, we may yet see the long\nawaited free lunch of truly cheap\nenergy. Strange, but true.\nSimon Bradshaw\nFebruary 17 1989 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

Many a true word,\nas they say.\nDudley Moore has returned to the\nscreen as the lovable tipsy multi-millionaire, still quipping his way\nthrough opulent frolics with wife\nLinda (Liza Minelli), despite the loss\nof his butler and best friend Hobson\n(John Gielgud).\nThe replacement comes in the\nform of Fairchild (Paul Benedict)\nwho offers a sterile subservience\nbeyond the call of duty. 'Hobson\nused to hit me with his hat' says\nArthur 'and call me a spoilt little\nshit.' We must have gone to\ndifferent buttle ring schools, sir',\nreplies the astonished Fairchild.\nThis is the only new face in the\nsequel to the 1981 smash hit.\nArthur's would be wife, Susan\nHohnson, and her father Burt return\nto hatch a plot aimed at forcing\nArthur into marriage, the principal\nmove is seizing control of the family\nI business, and in the process\nremoving Arthur' s personal\nI fortune. He visits grandma Martha\nI who tells him 'Burt Johnson has got\nthis family by the nuts. Marry the\nbitch.' Arthur is determined to get\na job and survive with Linda, who\nhopes to adopt a baby.\nAt this point there is a sharp\nchange in the script, hitherto\namusing and at times even\nhilarious. As events compound\nagainst him Arthur loses Linda, his\nlast grip on sobriety, and most\nimportantly his witty dia g logue. The\nfilm develops into a rather odd\nblend of tear-jerk er and comedy.\nThe parallel deprivation of a rich\nman without money and a mother\nwithout a child are shown, displayed as the underlying substance of the movie. In his\nalcoholic ally deluded state Arthur\nhas hallucinations of Hobson, who\nshows him how to create the\nun feasibly happy ending which we\ncan all for see. When Gielgud appears, skillfully\navoiding a caricature of his definitive\nSpitting Image self, it becomes clear\nwhat both Arthur's life and the film\nhave been lacking all along. His\nreappearance provides the best\nsequence of the story, a welcome\nresurgence.\nDespite this, and regardless of\nMoore's ability as a comedy actor,\nArthur 2 doesn't quite make the\ngrade. It is generally funny where\nit tries to be, and certainly tore at my\nheart-strings where it hoped to, but\noverall it remains a confusion of\nconflicting feelings.. There are\nseveral more entertaining films\naround and I recommend you go\nand see one of those instead.\nAndrew Clarke.\nPREVIEW\nTwins\nIt's the combination of the year Arnold Schwarzeneggar (Red Heat,\nPredator) and Danny De Vito (Throw\nMamma from the Train) as twins\nseparated at birth. They are the\nproduct of an experiment in science.\nSchwarzeneggar plays Julius, the\nperfect specimen, who has been\nraised on a South Seas island. De\nVito as Vincent, a less than perfect\nspecimen, a small time hustler.\nJulius seeks out Vincent and together they try to track down their\nmother, encountering adventure on\nthe way. Julius discovers sex and\nVincent discovers responsibility.\nWell, it sounds to me like\nsomeone had the great idea one day\nof teaming up Arnie and De Vito in\na film, but then forgot to provide\nthem with a plot. It will be very\ninteresting to see Schwarzeneggar\nactually trying to play intentional\ncomedy. He even makes his singing\ndebut in this film. The mere thought\ncurdles my senses.\nDe Vito may be a lot more adept\nat comedy but seems to be\nrehashing his character of Louie\nfrom Taxi.\nIt's a publicists dream, and a chance for critics to sharpen their\ntongues. I think curious it y alone will\nensure that this film is a hit. It's a clever ploy on the part of the film\ncompany\u2014whether the film is good\nor bad it'll have people laughing.\nIn the States the press tore it to\nshreds, the public went to see it in\ndroves and Arnie's wallet got fatter\nand fatter. He'll be running for\npublic office next.\nRelease Date 17th March.\nSumit Guha.\nFebruary 17 1989 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\nRising Thermals\nThis Christmas, the Imperial College Gliding Club shook off the winter\nblues with their flying holiday in the Shropshire hills. Home of the\nMidlands Gliding Club, the Long Mynd Hill site often provides the best\nof this country's winter soaring conditions and pilots from all over the\ncountry go there during their New Year breaks.\nWe towed two single-seat aircraft\nand one two seater off to Shropshire\nand up the perilous hill itself.\nStudents and ex-students made\ntheir way by road or by train,\nconverging on the small town of\nChurch Stretton. Despite getting\none glider trailer completely stuck\nand needing two cars to rescue it,\nwe ended up at the top of a bleak,\nwindswept ridge hil f, our home for\nthe next week.\nAmong the novices of our group,\nI had come for a taste of flying away\nfrom our home site at Lasham in\nHampshire. As I was to find out,\nflying on a small, windy hill is very\ndifferent from the huge airfield to\nwhich I was accustomed. Since mid-October I have been learning to fly\nwith the Imperial College Gliding\non each glider. Gliders are usually\nlaunched by one of two methods;\nwinching and, less often,\naero touring. Aerotouring involves\nbeing towed behind a powered light\naircraft. The cheaper alternative is\nto attach the glider to a very\npowerful winch on the ground,\nsome distance away from the launch\npoint. The strong cable is drawn\nvery quickly by the winch. This high\nspeed, up to sixty knots, allows the\nglider to climb very rapidly to a height of about fourteen hundred\nfeet. When the glider gets near to\nthe position of the winch, the cable\nis released and it is free to fly away.\nThe Midlands Gliding Club have a second winch back at the launch\npoint which draws the main cable\nback for the next glider. This lighter\na glider\nClub. At the moment I must fly with\nan instructor. For those of us in this\nposition, the Club had hired a wooden two-seater glider in addition to the usual two glass fibre\ngliders.\nThere is a sense of urgency as\ngliders are wheeled out of the tightly\npacked hangar on little trolleys.\nPilots are eager for the chance to fly\nand gliders must be carefully\ninspected and then pushed out to\nthe launch point to join the queue.\nSince very few people can afford\na glider and gliders are quite heavy\nto move around and launch, there\nare several people waiting for a turn\ncable is attached to the end of the\nmain cable so that there need be no\ndelay after the glider has released.\nThe reason for the Long My nd's popularity among glider pilots is\nsimple. When the wind blows in the\nright direction it is forced to flow\nover the long ridge hill and this\nproduces a long band of rising air\non the windward side. Apart from\nthe launch a glider or sail plane has\nonly one source of energy: rising air.\nAlthough a glider must always sink\nthrough its surrounding air in order\nto fly, if that surrounding air rises\nfast enough the glider will actually\nclimb. Soaring flight involves;\nBy Nicholas Merriam\nstaying aloft for a prolonged period\nof time by using this lift, either to\navoid descent or to recover height\nlost fly ng in still or sinking air.\nUnfortunately, this means that the\nLong My nd is at its best only when\nthe wind is strong and coming from\nthe right direction. One one day I did get an extended flight, having\nfound rising air caused by nothing\napparent.\nThe flight was preceded, as\nalways, by a series of control checks\nand strapping myself in well. Then\ncame the rocket-like acceleration as\nthe winch powered us forwards,\nand the steep climb to get as much\nheight as possible. In moments the\nlaunch was over, the cable released\nand we were free. My instructor had\npointed out that a number of gliders\nhad been accumulating in one area\nand seemed to be staying up there,\nso we set off to join them.\nThe rising air was limited in area\nand since it is not possible to simply\nstop in it we circled. One of the arts\nof soaring is to be able to find a circle\nwithin an invisible column of air.\nOur indicator is the position of\ngliders already circling. Careful and\nprecise flying is required when near\nother gliders in this situation. You\nmust be careful to keep a close eye\non the other gliders around you and\nyou must fly an even, accurate circle\nto make the most of the lift. Poor\nflying in this respect causes your\ncircle to drift out of the area of lift\nand to slip down faster than is\nnecessary.\nThis is when all the hard work on\nthe ground suddenly seems\nworthwhile, gently drifting, bird-like, across the countryside. This\narea of Shropshire is particularly\nscenic and, gazing down at the\ntranquil valleys, there is suddenly\nnowhere you would rather be.\nAt several thousand feet above the\nvalley floor, fields become\npatchwork decorations with toy\nhouses and miniature roads. You even feel at one with yourself, in\nharmony with nature, as you float\nby effortlessly.\nFrom the air, the landing area had\nlooked like a picnic blanket but\nsuddenly it seemed large as we pushed the glider back to the launch\nqueue.\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed\nmyself and I have got my name\ndown for next year.\nIf you would like to join us, come\nalong to a Gliding Club meeting one\nThursday afternoon. We meet at\n5.30pm in Aero 254.\nWALTER\nWALTER\nThe day of St Valentine has come\nand gone, and on top of that we are\nnow busy recovering from that\nother major event in the Christian\ncalendar. All those who immediately thought Walter was\nreferring to the budget, go and\nstand in the nearest corner. He was,\nand is, referring to Shrove Tuesday.\nThe original derivation of Shrove\nTuesday was the desire of Christians\nto use up all their remaining scraps\nof food, in order to prevent it\nbecoming a festering pile during the\nfasting time of Lent. This has been\nsubmerged in the modern desire to\nlay in mighty stocks of lemon and\nhoney, prior to the manufacture of\npancakes; a noble task.\nYou might gather from that last\ncomment that Walter is a considerable devotee of pancakes,\nand he is put in mind at this point\nof a physicist friend who desired to\nprove that it was impossible for a standard composition pancake to\nstick to the ceiling. The experiment\nwas conducted in impeccable style:\nMake pancake, propel upwards\nfrom pan, observe result. This\ntechnique proved to have one fatal\nflaw, which was that in order to\nobserve, one has to stand\nunderneath, so to speak; a risky\nprocedure, and all the more so in\nthe light of the eventual findings of\nthe said physicist, which may be\nsummarised in the ancient phrase,\n'What goes up, must come down.' Physicists are a remarkable lot,\nindeed. Walter is no physical\nscientist, preferring to stand pat\nwith those who study social\nsystems; he therefore tends to have\na difficult time understanding the\nfiner points of, for example, the\nbranch of physics which he feels\nwould be best named 'Jolly Small\nParticles and Things'. This is not\nmade any easier by the way in which our Physical brethren insist\non naming their particles. Quark,\nCharm and Superstring are names\nwhich spring to mind. It would be\nchurlish to speculate that the\nreasoning behind these names is\nthat they are easy to spell.\nAnotner set ot things which are\nfor once easy to spell, is the list of\nthis year's sabbatical candidates.\nNow that the papers have gone up,\nWalter is obliged to refrain from\nmentioning any of those names, but\ncandidates need not think that they\nhave escaped scrutiny altogether;\nonce the whole shouting match is\nover, the full story may be published\nin full.\nPage 6 FELIX February 17 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nHealth Centre\nThe doctors in the Health Centre seem to have only one thing on their\nmind, if the letters pages this week are to be believed. Unfortunately, over\nthe past year I have heard numerous stories of female students who are\nbombarded with detailed and ir rel event questions about their sex life\nwhenever they visit the doctors.\nThe problem is not confined to females. One male friend of mine took\nto the Health Centre with a very simple ailment and faced a barrage of\nvery personal and entirely unnecessary questions. He was so upset by\nthis that he climbed off the couch and stormed out of the surgery.\nI know that not all of the doctors at the Health Centre are to blame but\nthere can really be no excuse for subjecting students to this sort of\ninquisition.\nIt seems that some doctors in the Health Centre are sicker than their\npatients.\nJewish Society\nI was saddened to hear of the attacks made against the Jewish Society\nearlier this week. Posters were burned and anti-Jewish slogans ('f* ck the\nJews') daubed along the walkway. The attacks were as childish as they\nwere offensive. It is ironic that an incident such as this should occur in\nthe run up to Imperial College's International Week.\nManifestos\nThe deadline for Sabbatical election manifestos has been put back a week\nto Monday February 27th. Manifestos should be handed in to the FELIX\nOffice by 10.00am accompanied by a photograph, if you wish one to be\nprinted. Late manifestos will not be accepted. Manifestos should be\nsubmitted on a single side of A4 paper and should be handwritten or typed,\ndouble spaced. A maximum of 300 words will be allowed. Overlong\nmanifestos will be cut at the 300th word. Candidates will not be allowed\nto proof-read their own manifestos but FELIX staff will ensure that they\nare printed exactly as written.\nPublicity\nAny sabbatical candidates who have not yet seen me about publicity should\ndo so today. I will be available this weekend to assist with the production\nof posters and leaflets; please see me to book a time when you will be\nguaranteed complete privacy within the FELIX Office\nWe will be printing election publicity on Monday and Tuesday of next\nweek and all artwork should be completed by these dates.

    "content": "International Week\nInternational\nunderstanding\norganisations, market your ideas,\nand then make them happen.\nSome examples, in varied stages of\ncompletion, of things we're working\non:\n\u2022 a study tour of Malta. (Malta also\nhappens to have the highest\nconcentration of discos in Europe,\nbeaches aren't bad either).\nOrganised jointly with an AIESEC\ncommittee in malta, which is\nhelping to keep the costs to about\na third normal tourists pay.\n\u2022 A twinning event in Amsterdam,\nsponsored by Shell and with the\nhelp of a number of committees\ndown there. Tour of Shell facilities\nincluded.\nparticipating on a series of seminars\nand events organised in conjunction\nwith LSE, UCL, City and Kings\nuniversities, and holding an AIESEC week here at Imperial\nCollege. And that's a selection of\nwhat's available.\nAIESEC has a lot to offer. It can\nprovide you with practical insights\ninto the business world, provide\ntraining opportunities to test your\nskills. Whether you want brownie\npoints by exposing yourself to\ncompanies, work overseas, need\ncontacts outside England or are\nbored and want to get off the\nground, or just want to do something new. Find out how to\nmake AIESEC work for you.\nA tribute to the late Salvador Dali\nEver wanted to work somewhere in\nSouth East Asia, America or maybe\neven behind the Iron Curtain? Ever\nbeen bumming around Europe,\nnight time, no place to stay? Does\nyour College give you claustrophobia? You need a change.\nDoes all the theory give you mental\nconstipation? You need to get\nsomething tangible going, you want\nto find out more about the business\nworld, maybe even meet the people\nthat might give you a job when you\ngraduate? Do you have some good\nideas, but no cash and connections?\nAIESEC is a direct outcome of\nstudents trying to resolve these\nkinds of questions. In the official\nlingo, it's 'the world's largest non-political, non-profit making, entirely\nstudent run organisation'. AIESEC\nwas started back in 1949 by a group\nof students from seven countries,\nand is now represented worldwide\nin 67 countries, by about 50,000\nstudent members. AIESEC is a French synonym which stands for\n'International Society of Economics\nStudents' \u2014 but has been so\nsuccessful that it now embraces\nstudents from virtually all areas.\nAIESEC has two aims\n\u2022 To increase international\nunderstanding and cooperation.\n\u2022 To bridge the gap between\nuniversities and the 'real world'.\nBranches are free to move inside\nthese guidelines, and at Imperial\nwe're hoping to develop the\nundergraduate body by:\n\u2022 giving students the chance to\nexpose themselves to companies\nand the 'real world'.\n\u2022 give students the possibility to\nhave an experience overseas.\n\u2022 the creation of a fund to sponsor\nstudents projects (irrespective\nwhether they have anything to do\nwith AIESEC or not).\nWe can do this because AIESEC:\n\u2022 enjoys immense support through\nsponsorship and advice from the\nbusiness and academic community,\nat both national and international\nlevels.\n\u2022 can rely on an extensive\ninternational network of offices and\ncommittees.\n\u2022 has motivated and creative\nmembers.\nLast term, a new branch of AIESEC\nwas founded. Originating from the\nMech Eng Department, we are now\ntrying to involve students from all\nother departments. Most 1st years\nwill have by now been subjected to\nour rousing recruitment\npresentations. Response has been\nvaried. With good feedback from\nmost departments, people have\nmanaged to see the potential uses\nof AIESEC. But some departments\ncertainly surpassed Imperials'\nreputation of a staid campus. Faced\nby stiff competition from the Civ\nEng Department, the miners\nhowever managed to win our 'Too\nfat for sex' award for absolute\napathy. Whose dey?\nOne of the problems which\nconfront a lot of people when they\ncome into contact with AIESEC is\nthat AIESEC requires them to think\nindependently, to have ideas\u2014\nAIESEC 'only' provides the contacts\nand support for concepts.\nEntrepreneurial spirit is a prerequisite if you want to get the\nmost out of AIESEC, and not just\noccasionally participate on events.\nFor example, you have to be able to\ngo out to companies and \u2022 a series of business games in London, with university teams\ncompeting against each other.\n\u2022 raise jobs for the internat a ional exchange scheme (find out what\nthat is...)\n\u2022 the above mentioned fund \u2022 a shadowing scheme, whereby\nyou stick to a managers back for a period of time. Find out whether it\nreally is that cool being an accountant...\nIn the next couple of weeks we'll be\nsending a couple of people overseas\nto an international conference in Belgium( all expenses paid),\nWe work in small groups, with\none person usually there to\ncoordinate things.

    "content": "Travel\n77/1 INDEPENDENT\nELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER TRAVELLER T RAV Cappadocia\nCappadocia is situated virtually in the middle of Turkey, on the Central\nAnatolian Plateau that makes up most of Asia Minor. The area known\nas Cappadocia roughly fills a triangle of 200-300 square miles between\nthe towns of Nigde, Kayseri and Nevsehir. Eons ago the now extinct\nvolcanoes of Hasari Dagi and Eriyes Dagi covered the whole are with a deep layer of tufa, a soft stone of solidified mud, ash and lava. Over the\nages since the rivers of the region have scoured canyons and gulley s through the soft and porous stone and the elements have eroded it into\nfantastic crags, turrets, stalagmites and cones, creating a vast outdoor\ndisplay of stone sculptures in an incredible v are it y of shapes and colours.\nThe cone is the most common\nform inC appa do cia's lunar\nlandscape, many of them more than\na hundred feet tall, some in groups\nand others standing alone like\neccentric obelisks. The predominant\ncolour in some areas is ochre or\number, while in others it may be\nashen of even salt white. What\nnature has left undone in terms of\nfantastic sculpture, man has\ncompleted. For thousands of years\nthe C appa doc ian s have been\ncarving no uses and places of\nworship out of the rock cones,\nleaving behind whole rock villages\nand some of the finest examples of\nByzantine art in the world. Today,\nthe inhabitants of the region still for\nthe most part live in their rock\nhouses, perhaps with a modern\nextension. Cappadocia is only a twelve hour coach journey from\nIstanbul, so it is within easy reach\neven for the Inter-Railer, and it\nprovides an excellent opp our t unity to see a landscape unparalleled for\nits strange beauty.\nGoreme\nGoreme is one of the best places\nto base a visit to the region; its a small rock village in the centre of\none of the best landscapes, a rolling\nplain covered in thousands of pink\ncones that glow in the late afternoon\nsun. The village itself has several\nlittle pensions with rooms carved\nout of the cones, and even a couple\nof restaurants in rock houses. In\nfact, one of the restauranteurs has\na habit of dragging his guests off to\na genuine Turkish nightclub, where\nyou can see a room full of men\nwatching a single woman sing -quite an experience if your companions decide to teach the\nlocals a few Red Wedge songs at the\nsame time.\nAt the centre of the village is a Roman tomb constructed in a cone,\nwith two columns dangling in mid\nair from the side, the bottoms\nhaving eroded away. Nearby is\nGoreme National Park, where in a single valley there are collected\nsome of the finest examples of the\nFairy Chimneys near Zelve\nRock House, Goreme\nCappadocian churches. Amongst\nthe churches there is also a refectory\ncarved out of the hill, seats and table\nsculptured from the room. The\nfinest church is the Tokali church,\nwith a vaulted interior and beautiful\nfrescoes on a blue background.\nIn the valleys around Goreme\nthere are many goat tracks, along\nwhich one can spend an afternoon\nwandering through the landscape.\nAmongst the cones are a few\ndeserted churches, with fragments\nof frescoes remaining on the wall,\nsun bleached with time.\nKaymakli and Derinkuyu\nOn the road between Nevsehir\nand Nigde are the underground\ncities of Kaymakli and Derinkuyu.\nHere, the tufa has remained\nun eroded and the landscape is flat,\nbut this has not prevented the ever\nactive Cappadocians from carving\naway at the soft rock. Underneath\nthe plain they have carved out\nwhole cities from the tufa, some\ngoing as deep as eight storeys below\nthe surface. It is believed that there\nare more than twenty of these cities\nunderneath the surrounding plain,\nbut only two have been excavated\nand opened to the public.\nBoth cities are pretty similar,\ncorridors and narrow staircases\nconnecting rooms in a maze that\ngoes deeper and deeper into the\nground. Some of the passageways\nare lit and signposts indicate the\nway out; Kaymakli even has an\nunderground cafe! The more\nadventurous can take a torch with\nthem and explore the un lit caves,\nthat are reputed to extend for miles\nunder the tufa. Littered all over the\ncities are huge millstones that were\nused by the inhabitants to block the\npassageways against invaders.\nProbably the best experience of all\nis to stand at the bottom of the air\nvent on the eighth level of\nDerinkuyu and feel the cold air\nrising up the vent around oneself.\nZelve\nZelve is the most intact of the rock\nvillages, basically because it was\ndeserted in1950 due to rock falls.\nThe village has now been opened up\nas a museum of what the rock\nvillages used to look like, before the\nmodern extensions were built. The\nvillage is situated in a natural\namphitheatre at the junction of a valley and three canyons, the cliff\nfaces of which are riddled with the\nopenings of churches and houses.\nThe valleys and houses are probably\nthe most typical in Cappadocia;\ncones piled on cones up the side of\nthe canyons, each cone filled with\nthe windows of the now deserted\nhouses. Most of the houses can be\nexplored, the old monastery being\nquite a feat, carved as it is out of a sheer cliff. The village also contains\nthe only carved mosque in the\nregion.\nNearby are the Fairy Chimneys;\nsome of the most spectacular forms\nin the area. A group of phallic cones\nshaped like some weird fungus\nthrust from the dusty plain. The\nsoil, although it looks barren,\nproduces abundant grape vines,\nfrom which the local wine is made,\nwhich is surprisingly good.\nPaul Barton\nPage 4 FELIX February 17 1989\n\n"

    "content": "THE cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNUS national shutdown hits London\nRally success\ni*T/ ie /i rsf of two groups of students marching across Waterloo Bridge\nto join the rally outside the DES\nLegal action\nthreatens\nAUT\nOver 800 students gathered outside\nthe Department of Education and\nScience yesterday for a rally in protest against Student Loans. The\nrally was organised by the National\nUnion of Students' London branch\n( NUS London), as part of\nThursday's NUS National Education Shutdown.\nSpeakers at the rally reported on\naction taken by London' s Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Further Education,\nranging from a blockage of mail at\nKings College to a strike by catering\nstaff in support of students at\nThames Polytechnic.\nThe meeting was strongly\nsupported by a wide variety of\neducational establishments,\nincluding the London College of\nPrinting, the London School of\nEconomics, Middlesex Polytechnic,\nand Thames Polytechnic. Pupils\nfrom Pimlico School, with which IC\nhas a student teaching connection,\nwere also present.\nThe meeting dispersed peacefully\nafter a number of speeches calling\nfor greater action by the National\nNUS Executive and further marches\nthrough London.\nNUS London General Secretary\nPhil Woodford told FELIX that he\nfelt the meeting had been 'very\npositive' with 'students showing\ntheir anger at the Government's proposals.'\nAround London, University College Students Union organised\na picket of the College's entrances,\nand an 'Overdraft Disco' in the\nevening, which was free to students\nwith bank overdrafts. The London\nSchool of Economics reported a large number of lectures cancelled\nfor the education shutdown and\nheld a 'Bop against Baker' in the\nevening. Elsewhere, the University\nof London Union (ULU) acted as an\ninformation centre throughout the\nday in support of the NUS education shutdown and held a leaflet distribution at Oxford Circus.\nAt Imperial College, the Union\nBar was open throughout the day,\nwhilst Pool and Table Football\ntournaments were held in the Union\nSnack Bar and information sheets\nwere distributed to students. MP for\nTottenham, Bernie Grant also spoke\nto 50 students in the Union Lounge.\nIC Union President, Nigel Baker\ntold FELIX that although IC Union\nwas supporting the NUS' National\nEducation Shutdown, the College\nhad refused to support students by\nrearranging lectures. He claimed the\nCollege's lack of support was due to\nthe poor turnout for ICU's lobby of\nParliament last month. Lectures\nwere rescheduled around the\nCollege for 250 or so students to\nattend the lobby. Mr Baker told\nFELIX that the Rector had pointed\nout the lack of support as a reason\nfor not supporting any further\naction. He added that the Union\nwas 'trying to take the positive side'\nby offering students an alternative\nto lectures on the shutdown day\nrather than encouraging students to\nboycott lectures. Mr Baker went on\nto complain at the lack of support\nby students for the organisation of\nthe shutdown at IC and the Union's vigil outside the DES on February 6.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nNUS' action against student loans\nculminates on Saturday February 25\nwhen a national gathering of\nstudents will march from Victoria\nEmbankment to Kennington Park,\nwhere a Festival is planned. IC\nUnion is supporting the march and\nwill meet in Beit Quadrangle at\nHam. Mr Baker told FELIX that he\nhopes to have an Imperial College\nUnion banner for the event and\nplans to distribute publicity next\nweek.\nThe College are taking legal advice\nfollowing threats by the Students'\nUnion to sue the College if students\nare deprived of degrees by the\naction of the Association of\nUniversity Teachers (AUT).\nThe Union have been informed by\nlegal experts that they would have\na very good case to sue for the cost\nof fees and maintain ance for a repeat\nyear for those students deprived of\ntheir degree due to the AUT' s examination boycott. It is estimated\nthat such action could cost the\nCollege up to \u00a344 million.\nThe AUT began their boycott,\nwhich affects 70,000 undergraduates\nthroughout the country, at the start\nof the term, in protest against the\nCommittee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals (CVCP) refusal to present\na pay offer for the 1988/89 session.\nThe CVC P have since offered a3% pay rise which they admit is\n'em baras singly low.' Wages for\nacademics currently range from\n\u00a39200 for lecturers to \u00a329,000 for\nprofessors.\nIC Union President, Nigel Baker\ntold FELIX that the threat of legal\naction would force the College to\nput pressure on either the CVC P or\nthe AUT for an end to the action. He\npointed out that the College might\ntake legal action against AUT members for breach of contract,\nshould the Union go ahead with its\nlegal claim.\nPresident of the Imperial College\nBranch of the AUT, Susan Parry\nsaid that she was unhappy with the\nStudents Union decision.\n'It would be more constructive for\nthe students if they put pressure on\nthe CVC P and the Department of\nEducation and Science' she said.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSpeaking at the Careers Advisory\nBoard Student Liason Committee on\nTuesday, Deputy President Chas\ncont'd on back page\nISSUE 828 17 FEB 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs/Sport\nFOOTBALL\nA win at last\nRS M0 IC II\u20142\nAfter three defeats, IC desperately\nneeded a win to keep sight of the\nleague title. In a traditionally\nphysical game RS M opened well, at\nleast for the first ten minutes, IC\nthen began to play, with debut ant John West controlling the mid-field,\nJulian Fordham's penetrating runs\nand the ever tricky Adam Thomas\nhelped IC gain control and before\nlong Mickey Plummer scored his\nfourth goal from 25 yards, in three\ngames to give IC the breakthrough.\n1-0 it was at half-time, and captain\nJezz Holland, playing in borrowed\nboots, was as happy as pie. But as\nthe saying goes, it's not all over until\nthe fat lady sings, and Simon\nHolden had barely cleared his\nthroat! Mines started the second half\nwell, but just lacked the ideas as\nIvan Parkin and Bill Leonard cleared\nup at the back. IC on the attack\nagain, and Gary Mahoney came\nclose before John West played a beautiful through ball to Rakesh\nMuthoo, who calmly slotted home\nfrom 10 yards. After that it was plain\nsailing for IC, with Mines causing no\nproblems for Russ Dark of Jezz at\nthe back. A special mention should\ngo to Simon Day, who refereed a tough game very well, despite what\nmay have been said on the pitch!\nFOOTBALL\nStormer\nLondon Hospital\u20141\nIC l sts \u20144\nIC stormed back to the top of the\nPremier Division with an impressive\ndemolition of bottom side London\nHospital.\nEager to impress after two successive defeats, IC attacked with\nvigour from the offset, creating\nnumerous chances but failing to\nconvert any of them. London Hospital then had the audacity to\ntake the led on their first real attack;\na free kick on the left found an\nunmarked man and his speculative\nheader somehow looped over the\nembarrassed keeper.\nIC were still behind going into the\nsecond half but they kept pressing\nforward, looking for ways to break\ndown the packed defence. The\ninevitable equalise r came after ten\nminutes of the second half from Pip\nPeel who made himself some space\nin the area to fire home superbly.\nFrom then on there was only going\nto be one winner as Mick Plummer's searing runs down the right flank\ntore their defence apart. Pip Peel\nsoon added another and a fine win\nwas rounded off with an own goal\nand a strike from Nigel Collier.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nRunning in\nRichmond\nThe fifth race of the London\nColleges League, held at Richmond\nPark, was organised by the IC\nCrossCountry Club. The un seasonal weather had given rise\nto an extremely dry course, which\nalmost made it into a road race,\nexcept for the first mile which was\nrun on horse track. In fact, the start\nwas the most demanding part of the\nrace, as everyone scrambled for\nposition on the strength-sapping\nsurface. The course came onto grass\nafter about a mile, and alternated\nbetween grass and 'road' for the\nremainder.\nThe team has been struck by an\ninjury crisis; knee, calf, back, groin\nand achilles strains have weakened\nour squad. Frank Dudbridge had\nhoped for another top ten placing,\nbut on the day suffered a loss of\nform, and dropped back to finish\n33rd. Our next man was Dave\nKnight (37th), who caught Frank\nafter three miles but was too\nknacker ed to take advantage,\nfollowed to placed behind by Stefan\nLedin, breaking 40 for the first time.\nMatt Lynas, running with a back\ninjury sustained while orienteering,\ncame in 46th. Our other two scorers\nwere Pete Smith (74th) and Ramin\n' Dil'(94 th). Despite a below-par\nrace, the team still made fifth place\nto confirm its league position. Frank\nhas moved up to fourth in the\nindividuals (in the first division).\nThere is one race left in the series,\na10 km road race in Battersea Park.\nCoach Bill Mason marked the\nclub's success by declaring that all\nthe crews would have extra hard\noutings on Sunday morning, to\nmake sure that everybody wins next\ntime.\nMORE FOOTBALL\nThick and\nFast\nImperial College VI\u20145\nCX WM III\u20144\nIn a high scoring contest, IC VI\nnever looked in danger of losing\ntheir grip and ran out comfortable\nwinners to extend their unbeaten\nrun.\nOn a small pitch it was not\nsurprising that the goals started\nflying in well before half time. IC got\nthe better of these early exchanges\nthanks to some fine goals by Nigel\nSale, Simon Barrye and Byron\nWood to lead 3-2 at half-time. In a hectic and wild second half IC\nclinched the contest when Ian\nCharlton and Simon Barrye scored.\nAndy Draine, John McKnight and\nsome others were rather fortunate\nto finish the game without entering\nthe referee's book as some of their\nprotests to what were admittedly\nsome incredulous decisions, were\nnot exactly fit for prime time\nviewing.\nBOAT CLUB\nFive out of\nSeven\nLast Saturday's Henley Fours Head\nwas dominated by the Imperial\nCollege Boat Club. Imperial Crews\nwon five of the seven categories that\nthey entered.\nIn the first major race of the year,\nthe Lady novices picked up their\nfirst pots, after only four months of\nrowing. The mens novices also put\nin an impressive performance,\ncoming in over 40 seconds a he; d of\ntheir nearest rivals. The senior 2\ncox less, senior 1 cox less and open\ncox ed crews all won their categories\neasily, despite cold and very windy\nconditions. The open cox ed for also\nwon the overall competition with\nthe fastest time of the day.\nThe senior 3 crews were all\nunlucky not to do better in their\nevents. The second men's four and\nthe ladies four both suffered\nunfortunate clashes with other boats\nand river banks. The first senior 3\nfour va me in well ahead of most of\nthe other crews in their category but\nwere beaten into second place by an\nexperienced crew from the University of London boat club.\nORIENTEERING\nGoing for it\nin Guildford\nLast Sunday the Orienteering Club\nwent to its first major event of the\nyear; held in Surrey, just south of\nGuildford. The competition area\nwas an intricate and beautiful pine\nforest and heathland, definitely the\nbest area the club has been to for\nseveral months. The weather was\nmild and sunny which made for\nideal orienteering conditions.\nDespite the long and tough courses\nall the IC competitors achieved fast\ntimes, and the prospects for this\nseason are looking good. The\njourney home was memorable and\nwe didn't get lost!\nDANCE\nSwing that\nThing\nOn Saturday February 4, Sheffield\nUniversity hosted an inter-varsity\ncompetition at which the Imperial\nCollege contingent of A,B and C teams were but three among the\nmany attending from all over the\ncountry. The event was a really\ntremendous occasion and was made\nall the more special by a spectacular\ndemonstration by the World Professional Ten-Dance champions,\nMarcus and Karen Hilton.\nCompetitively, the three teams\nhad a very successful evening; the\nB team stormed home to sweep\naway the B team trophy and the A and C teams were second only to\nthe old rivals Cambridge reflecting\nthe outstanding achievements of so\nmany of our couples. IC had semifinalists in all dances with the\nfollowing positions in the final:\nQ Step: James Barton and Gill\nBarrett-l st Cha: Sharad Sammay and Alice\nJacques\u20142\nNeil McClusky and Lilly Saw\u20143rd Jive: Steven Mercer and Nicola\nStanmore\u20141st Alex Kur nia wan and Thin uk Basu\u20142nd Open Tango: James Barren and Gill\nBarrlett-4th Open Rhumba: Steven Mercer and\nNicola Stanmore\u20142nd Cha/Waltz: Peter Brent and Rebecca\nBailey-4th Special congratulations to Thinuk\nand Alex for a fantastic result in their first competition and many\nthanks to all those who turned up\nto offer such well appreciated\nsupport.\nFinally, a big thanks to our coach\nVikki Cunnifre who, as ever, has\nmade us what we are.\nFebruary 17 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

The remaining candidate, Carol Luscombe was unopposed and was\nsubsequently ratified as\nPresident-elect.\nMr Johansen-AUison used defaced\ncopies of Ms Luscombe's posters as\npart of his campaign. He also failed\nto provide a photo and manifesto for\nthe election edition of the R CSU magazine Broadsheet. He claims that\nhe was not told that the posters\nbroke election rules until Wednesday evening when he was\nable to find a copy of the publicity\nrules. He also claims that he was not\ninformed of the magazine's publication.\nThe R CSU Returning Officer\ndeemed the election bid invalid on\nWednesday and an appeal was\nlodged to be heard at the Hustings\nMeeting. Mr Johansen-Allison did\nnot speak in his own defence. He later told FELIX that he was unaware that he had such speaking\nrights and felt that the way his\ncampaign had been treated was\ntypical of the 'mason-like' attitude\nof RCS Union.\nThe Returning Officer claims to\nhave held the election strictly\naccording to the rules and that it is\nnot his duty to pass these rules on\nto the candidates.\nPresident-elect Carol Luscombe\nlater told FELIX that this was not the\nway she wanted to win the election\nbut that Mr. Johansen-Allison had\n'seriously bent' the rules and had\nhad to be disqualified.

The\nincident has ' deeply upset'\nmembers of Imperial College Jewish\nSociety.\nAn A2 size poster, marked with\nthe caption ' God bless Palestine'\nwas also found on the scene. The\nposter, headed 'Israeli Butcher',\ncompared Jews with members of the\nNazi party.\nChairman of Imperial College\nFriends of Palestine Society told\nFELIX that the Society was not\nresponsible for the incident. 'It is\nracist and unacceptable' he said. He\nwent on to suggest that the attack\nhad been ca ried out in order to\n'discredit' Friends of Palestine.\nThe Union Executive Committee\nhave mandated' Hon Sec (Events)\nIan Morris to write to the Friends of\nPalestine expressing the Unions\nconcern at the incident.

Both\nPhil Drew and Graham Price were on hand to\nrepresent St Mary's in these discussions.\nHowever an Imperial student, realising that their\n2.30pm lectures were about to start and that a large block of the IC vote would disappear to\nattend lectures, proposed thi 's sue went\nstraight to a vote. This pro. .. 5 carried.\nA couple of procedural motions about the vote\nwere then put forward. Were St Mary's students\nmembers of IC Union and therefore eligible to\nvote? Do St Mary's students have IC Ur.n cards\nin order to vote? Only Medical cr,1 ID cards\nwould be allowable as proof of St i ary's student\nstatus.\nYours sincerely,\nDominic O 'Kane, PATA Chairman 1988-89\nImperialism\nDear Bill,\nHe's unstoppable, he's determined to wreck\nthe College and we're powerless to stop him!\nWho? Eric Ash of course\u2014just take a look at the\nlatest proposal to merge with RH B NC \u2014 I give up,\nall we can do is ride the storm and hope to\nsurvive. By way of explanation, have you noticed\nthat:\nImperial College of Science, Technology and\nMedicine neatly (and ominously) rearranges to:\nI concede, iC mangled to pieces in lone Eric\nEgham folly.\nGoodbye IC, welcome to the Polytechnic of\nSouth East England.\nYours disp airing ly,S G Banton,\nEx-just about am/thing you can think of.\nGod to Dave Dear Bill,\nDave Thomas is right!\nYours eternally,\nGod.\nDoctor's Orders\nDear Bill,\nLast year whilst suffering from glandular fever\nI finally submitted to my symptoms and visited\nthe Health Centre. (I'm paranoid about wasting\nthe Doctor's valuable time and only go when it\nis a choice between a Doctor and the Last Rites).\nThe questions fired:\nDo you have a boyfriend?\nAre you sleeping with him?\nHave you slept with anyone?\nAre you sure?\nFunny, but I could have sworn that the Doctor\nwas trying for a run of small ads in FELIX.\nFinally, after a patronising lecture on student\nillnesses all being related to stress and sex, I left\ntotally disgruntled. The advice? Go home, lie\ndown and take a paracetamol!! (A paracetamol\u2014a fast food in the world of medicine.)\nOn another occasion a friend of mine needed\na Doctor to be called out and was given a two\nminute diagnosis over the phone. Surely the\nDoctor should also have given an IC test over the\nphone? We all know how impossible articulation\nof symptoms can be. Yet how strange, the Doctor\ncan afford the time to take full account of that\nheadache, hangover, nosebleed etc. during the\nhypochondriac's frequent visits to the surgery.\nSurely we could all avoid a half hour wait for the\nopen surgery and phone-in our symptoms to the\nanswerphone. Or, with hindsight, just maintain\na supply of paracetamol.\nYours sincerely;\nAnn Roberts (Maths I). Benefits\nDear Bill,\nIn last week's FELIX an article appeared\nentitled 'Loans Publicity'. Whilst I agree with the\nauthor's sentiments regarding the effect\nwithdrawal of Social Security Benefits will have,\nthe article also contained some inaccuracies which\nare very misleading.\nThe article stated that the legislation regarding\na student's right to claim Housing Benefit and\nIncome Support had already been passed. This\nis not correct. I contacted the DSS Policy Unit and\nwas told that the legislation is scheduled to come\ninto effect from September 1990. The timetable\nof the Bill introducing these charges is not yet\nknown.\nIt was also stated that 'these cuts are total'\nimplying that no student would be able to claim\nany form of benefit whatsoever. Certainly the cuts\nwill be devastating but it is likely that there will\nstill be some benefit that certain students will be\nable to claim. Therefore until the Bill has made\nits passage through Parliament it is unwise to\nmake assumptions as to the full extent of the cuts.\nTherefore the current position is that students\nare still eligible to claim benefits until September\n1990. It still remains to be seen what the real\nimpact of the legislation will be.\nYours sincerely,\nYve Posner, Welfare Adviser.\nHarsh Graffiti\nDear Bill,\nI was horrified by the sight of neo-Nazi posters,\ngraf it ti and burnt remnants of Jewish Society\nposters on the walkway today. Crudely drawn\nposters depicted soldiers wearing the Star of\nDavid acting like Nazis, captioned with phrases\nlike 'Jewish Butcher'. Wellsoc and Filmsoc posters\nwere daubed with anti-Israeli slogans and\nswastikas.\nThe aim of this despicable display was to make\na perverted link between the atrocities of the\nkilling of six million Jews in the Holocaust, and\nthe treatment of Arab refugees in Judea and\nSamaria. The same thugs bear the legacy of those\nsuch as the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. It was HajAmin al Husseini, a best friend of Eichmann, who\ncongratulated Hitler on his successes and constantly incited an acceleration of the\nextermination measures. Some make the claim\nthe Holocaust never occurred; equally monstrous\nare those who try to salve their consciences by\nplacing Jews today in the boots of the Nazis.\nYours faith fully,\nN Nelkon, Department of Computing.\nFree Radicals\nDear Bill,\nI was disappointed to read in last week's FELIX\nAndrew Allum's insult to freedom of speech and\nIC students as a whole.\nI agree that the use of the label 'Water Polo\nClub' as a cover should not have been made. The\nunderlying issue is not the method used to attract\nthe normally impartial IC students to the problem\nof student loans. Rather, it is how to organise\nthem into a co her rent group capable of defending\nthe right of higher education to everyone.\nTo this effect Julian Moore seems to have put\na lot of effort into organising people with the\ncommon conviction that student loans are unjust\nand do not work in practice (eg Sweden).\nIf the government wants to pass legislation on\nany issue you have the right to oppose it by\ndemonstrating, writing to your MP or lobbying\nParliament. This is the essence of democracy.\nInstead Andrew Allum seems to be lei vein apathy and the Tet-the-government-do-what they want' attitude. This is not only dangerous\n(what becomes of democracy without cynicism\ntowards its leaders?) but it is also an insult\ntowards the (supposedly) intelligent student\npopulation of IC. I do not believe Andrew All um has the right to talk about his fellow students as\n'innocent' just because they disagree with him. Would De Gaule have been overthrown\nwithout the initial reaction of the French\nstudents?\nICU was and is apolitical. However, it is the\nstudents of tomorrow who will decide the future\npolitical trend of ICU and certainly not Andrew\nAllum who seems to be more apt at condemning\nstudents who believe in building a more equal,\ncaring and fair country.\nLastly, how can Andrew Allum state with such\nconviction that 'most IC students are generally\nproud of our student union' without some kind\nof 'logical' backup?\nStephen McKeever, DOC II.\nPS. Andrew, would you be so apolitical if you\nlived in Poland?\nSo in Love?\nDear Bill,\nThis has been a busy week, but I felt that I had\nto write this letter in order to thank the members\nof Imperial College for saving me a lot of hard\nwork. Normally my rounds of the universities\ntake up most of my time, with all those young\nfolk in such large numbers and at such close\nquarters. Students usually rush me off my feet,\nfalling in and out of love faster than you can say\n' HIV. But IC is an exception and provides me\nwith a nice place to sit down and rest my wings\non February 14.\nAll my love,\nCupid.\nFebruary 17 1989 FELIX\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nLeslie Nielsen\nAn interview with the star of\nNaked Gun by Sumit Guha\nLeslie Nielsen is one of those actors\nwith an instantly recognisable face,\nif not name. He has appeared in around sixty films and over one\nthousand American TV shows. But,\nonly now, at the age of 62,is he\nreceiving widespread international\nfame and star status.\nBefore now, many of us knew him\nas the silver haired doctor in Airplane, produced by the Z AZ team\n(Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker). He followed that with a short lived\ncomedy series, Police Squad; a parody of all those US cop shows.\nHe played the bumbling LA cop Lt.\nFrank Drebin.\nIn The Naked gun, he reprises the\nrole in an hilarious film version of\nPolice Squad made, with their usual\nlack of subtlety, by the Z AZ team.\nIn the opening sequence Drebin\ngoes on holiday to Beirut 'to get\nsome peace', and ends up battling\nthe Ayatollah, Idi Amin Gadaffi,\nArafat and Gorbachev in a fist-fight!\nThe film also stars Prescilla\nPresley, in her first big screen role,\nand Ricardo Montalban as the\nmastermind of a plot to assassinate\nthe Queen.\nDirector David Zucker says 'I think that, behind the jokes and the\ngags, The Naked gun has an important message. It's one man's struggle within himself to defeat the\ndemons that terror is e the soul, set\nagainst the backdrop of the Crimean\nWar.'\nWe weren't quite convinced, so\nwe caught up with Leslie Nielsen on\nhis recent visit to London to get a few answers.\nHe walks into the room dressed\ncasually as if he's just been for a walk in the park. His mood is\nrelaxed and jovial. He sits down and\nimmediately offers us a mint.\n'Anybody want a pill', he chuckles.\nThis guy is not your usual Hollywood leading man.\nCan you tell me something about\nyour television series?\nIt was called Police Squad, and it\nwas in my opinion one of the\nfunniest series. We had some\nwonderful things in it. We had a guest star each week who died in the main title, stars like Lo me Greene, Bill Conrad and John\nBelushi. In the movie and the TV show we had Big AI\u2014he was too tall\nand we didn't have enough money\nto get his head in the frame.\nWe had a shoe-shine guy in the\nseries who was an expert on everything from how to coach\nbaseball, to doing a brain operation.\nWe always had a phrase, ' Go find\nout what the word is on the street',\nmeaning ' Go get your shoeshine',\nand I'd say 'What's happening with\nthe gymnasium kidnapping', and\nhe'd say ' Oh, I wouldn't know\nabout that', looking up and down the street. You give him a dollar and\nthen he talks, spilling the beans,\ntelling you how to do anything and\neverything.\nAt the end of the show we have\na freeze frame. We didn't have\nenough money, so we'd freeze\nmanually. So I'd be talking with my\nboss. He says at the end 'It's really\nwonderful, justice being done'. I'd say \"That's right'\u2014he freezes. Now he'd smile and I'd be smiling but\nhe'd be pouring coffee through my\nfingers.\nIt has become a kind of a cult\nshow in the States and even when\nwe were taken off the air after four\nshows, in LA alone they received\nover 20,000 letters from people who\nwere terribly offended, as well as\ncritics conducting letter writing\ncampaigns who were totally\noffended that ABC had the audacity\nand insensitivity to take this breath\nof fresh air off the air.'\nHis tone gets slightly harsher giving\nthe impression that he would like very\nmuch to string up and dismember each\nof the ABC executives responsible.\nBut in any event it didn't belong\non television because it's the kind\nof humour that you must pay\nattention to, and when you have\nsome th ig upon the big screen,\nwhere you've gone there to view it\nspecifically and since it's bigger than\nlife you'd see things you don'* see\non TV. Television is like an adjunct\nto the family\u2014you get up in the\nmorning and you turn it on, and\nyou can hear it, it's in the\nbackground. If you hear a laugh or\na noise you take a quick look and\nsomebody can tell you what\nhappened but you listen to it, you don't watch it. With us, our humour, you really have to watch\nand pay attention because of its\ncraziness.\nAt this time someone opens a door by\nmistake. 'Wait a minute', he says\nputting on a serious face, 'We do police\nwork here'. The guy is scared off. 'See\nhow easy it is'\u2014he smirks.\nHow and why did you get involved\nwith this type of humour?\n'When I got the script (to Airplane)\nfor the first time, I called my agent\nand said 'I don't want you to\nnegotiate this. Don't tell them, but\nI 'll pay them to do the part! I'm on\nthat wavelength, that's my kind of\nhumour\u2014that style of insanity.\nAfter watching the crisis drama\nshows that I 've been doing through\nthe years, I began laughing at\nmyself, at the grave situations we\nwere involved in. So I knew\nimmediately why they wanted me\nfor Airplane, because if I behave as\nseriously as I did in my regular\nwork, this stuff would be very\nfunny.\nYou get to grips with the Queen of\nthe film. What do you think of your\nchances of an honorary knighthood, now?\nBreakfast wouldn't be bad! In\nCanada the monarchists were very\noffended and I suspect that there\nwill be a few people who will be\noffended. That's the way it goes.\nBut in general 1 think that the vein\nof humour will carry the day and\nthere'll be no big deal.\nWhat type of people make you laugh?\nAnyone who catches me off\nguard. I like dumb things. I like wit.\n1 will try anything and everything\nto get a laugh.\nWhat about British humour?\nI like British humour. A lot of\nAmerican humour takes you by the\nhand and leads you through to the\njoke. In British comedy you're left\nto find the joke yourself. But if it\nmakes me laugh I like it.\nWhat about Priscilla Presley? Did she take well to playing comedy?\nShe took to it so easily. She's a very elegant and beautiful woman.\nI think that's part of the exterior she\nwishes to present to people. So\nthere she was, across the stage on\nour first day. The moment I caught\nhe eyes I went.\nHe erases his eyes.\nAnd she went,\nHe crosses his eyes again and makes\na silly face.\nAnd that was it. So you've got this\nelegant woman who's got that\neleven year-old girl working inside,\nready to make faces. So I knew then\nthat we'd have a lot of fun, and we\ndid.\nYou're in the hands of people like\nZA Z.I have such abiding respect\nand admiration for them. They're\nvery funny and supportive. If you\nthink about the humour in the\npicture there's nothing mean\nspirited about it. It's just affectionate\nsomehow, so there's no way that\nPrescilla would not do well.\nAt what point would you draw the\nline with their humour?\nWith the Zuckers I have such\nrespect for them, not only as\nprofessionals but humans that I would do almost anything they'd say. In the end I trust their\njudgement completely. For example, in the slaughterhouse\nscene, we had a terrific vomit\nsequence that we cut. It was just\ngross. I was a little worried about\nthe ' Hit the Fan' sequence in Airplane, but David (Zucker) took\nme to a theatre and, of course, the\nkids went mad. So I trust their\njudgement.\nPage 8 FELIX February 17 1989\n\n"

It's the joining\nbond between Europe, Asia and\nAfrica. The land of the sun and the\nsea.\nDuring many years of its rough\nhistory, Greece was under foreign\noccupation. Greek people have\nmade an enormous struggle to gain\ntheir national independence and\njust in the early years of this\ncentury, Greece\u2014as it stands\ntoday\u2014was formed. Nowadays\nGreek people are working for\nprogress and peace in their country\nand in the whole world.\nD Estaxiopoulos, Maths PG.\nCyprus\nThe clich es of the Mediterranean\nholiday really do come true in Cyprus, the longest island in the\nEast Mediterranean. The sun really\ndoes shine bright for most of the\nyear and the beaches really are\nunspoiled. Behind this tranquility,\nhowever, lurks a long history of\nforeign rule going back some 8000\nyears. Cyprus became an independent state in 1960. In 1974\nTurkish forces invaded Cyprus. As a result 40% of the island was\noccupied and one third of the\npopulation uprooted. Today, fifteen\nyears later, Turkey continues its\nunlawful occupation.

The\nother major nationality is the\nTamils, speakers of the Tamil\nlanguage and mostly followers of\nHinduism.\nSamantha Kappagode, Maths 3\nPresident Sri Lanka Society.\nSingapore\nThe Malay Annals record that\nSingapore derives its name from\n'Singa' which means lion. This is\nprobably from the anecdote of a Malay prince naming the city after\nsighting the beast in the island.\nThe country has no national\nresources but its dynamic people\nhave made Singapore into the most\nimportant finance, production and\ntrading centre between Hong Kong\nand the Persian Gulf.\nThe IC Singapore Society aims to\npromote interaction and friendship\nbetween Singaporean and non-Singaporean students of the College\nand also introduce the cultures ad\nphilosophies of South East Asia.\nYou can experience South East\nAsian cooking at the Singapore food\nstall at International Night when we\nwill be offering Fried Bee Hoon( or\nver mic ill i),T ao HuGo ren g(be an curd salad).\nHappy Eating.\nKaren Phua, Chemistry 2\nPresident Singapore Society.\nSpecial feature on Turkey page 4.\nFebruary 17 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
