    "content": "' \u20ac > ji10 LETTERS FELIX Your Letters\nTake One UCL Merger\nDear Felix,\nI have an indecent tendency to\nramble so before the off, as it were,\nI'd like to set a few things straight.\nFirstly, I am definitely in favour of a possible merger with UCL - I think\nthat beyond the immediate obvious\nproblems everyone has to admit that\nthe subject range here at Imperial is\npretty narrow and in some senses\ncrippling. Secondly, I have much\nrespect for the union 'hacks' and\nsabbaticals that do a fantastic job\nagainst multiple committee odds,\nand provide pretty good support to\nour active (?) student population\n(and I'm not just trying to score\nbrownie points here). With that out\nthe way, the point I would like to\naddress is that, however desirable,\nthe actual likelihood of such a merger with UCL seems to me pretty\ndamned slim. This view has been\nprompted from recent events within,\nof all places, the IC Canoe Club.\nBear with me on this one, and let\nme explain: I have been a canoe\nobsession al for a far few years now,\nand over the past three years I 've\nslowly earned canoe club guru sta-tus. This IC club is a bit of an oddity in the fact that if you're a student\nin that strange amalgamation that is\nUniversity of London, and fancy a spot of Whitewater canoeing, we're\npretty much the only place that you\ncan come (ULU run a canoe club\nbut as far as I know they're yet to\nleave the swimming pool - no\noffense intended). With this in mind,\nat the start of the year we tend to\nrecruit not only the usual crop of IC\nfresher s, but also a significant number of dedicated paddlers from UCL,\nLSE, etc. The beginning of this year\nhas proved slightly different how ev er, due in no small way to a union\nofficial watching someone in a UCL\nrugby top filling out one of our membership forms.\nIn a very understandable way, IC\nUnion want the money they put in to\nthe IC club to benefit IC students. To\nthis end IC students receive sub-sidi sed travel, accommodation, and\nso on while students from other\nLondon universities do not and have\nto pay up the full whack. This is all\nfairly standard, but a point that I think is not yet widely realised, and\nmust apply to many other clubs\nthan our own, is that being in a London university belonging to ULU\ndoes not necessarily allow you to\njoin an IC club as an un sub sidi sed member. Imperial and the university\ninvolved has also to sign a're ci pro cal agreement' first. Following the\naforementioned UCL rugby top in ci dent, an amiable chat and rather\nincriminating piece of A4 paper from\nthe union ensued. Although Imperial\nseems to have 'reciprocal agree-ment s' with every London universi-ty/college under the sun (the list\nfilled a double columned A4 page),\nUCL is nowhere to be found.\nApparently the two universities\ncould not come to an agreement in\nwhat is surely a fairly simple issue.\nI'm not an insurance policy leg-end, and I certainly don't know all\nthe ins and outs of this case (in fact,\nI don't even know what the 'rec i pro cal agreement' is), but this omission\nraises a few interesting questions.\nConsidering UCL members would\nbe un sub sidi sed( and thus 'steal' no\nIC money), what really is the problem with them joining our club? Our\nmembers from UCL don't just see\nour stand at fresher s fair and fancy a crack, they have been\nreferred/searched us out and thus\ntend to be fairly experienced pad-dl ers. In a sport with a by necessity\nhigh experienced to inexperienced\nratio needed, do the union really\nwant us to expel our experienced\nUCL members and effectively be\nless safe on the river? Don't get me\nwrong - this club exists to introduce\nand cultivate the skills of IC students\nin the back art that is travelling\ndown vicious rivers in a small plastic thing, but quality, safe paddlers\ncome far and few between, and I honestly think it is wrong to ignore\nwhat UCL students have to offer.\nBut I'm already off on a tangent -the main point is that although this\nis obviously an Imperial and UCL\nunion related matter rather than an\nacademic institutional concern, I can't help feeling it has implications\nfor a possible merger. If IC and UCL\ncannot agree to something as simple\nas a clubs and societies 'reciprocal\nagreement', surely this doesn't bode\ntoo well for agreement on no doubt\nexceedingly complicated issues that\nwould arise in relation to full UCL/IC\nintegration. UCL and IC merger? It'll\nbe a full five to ten years before even\nthe basic framework is sorted out, if\nyou ask me, and by then I 'll be long\ngone.\nCynically,\nRob Tuley, 4th Year Mech Eng\nIt is clear from reading our new\nRector's prose, that he intends to\nmanage it like a huge business corporation (\"need to change our\nbrand\", \"international market\",\n\"merger\"...). While there's nothing\ninherently wrong with this, and\nsometimes a little dynamism is\ngood, I hope we all recognise that IC\nis very different from a car or\n(indeed) a pharmaceutical company.\nIn all this talk of \"opening up\" and\nbeing \"competitive\" there is a big\ndanger that research (like pure\nmathematics or physics etc.) that\ndoes not bring in immediate divi-d ends, or grants from the US\nDefence department or GSK, will be\naxed. The independence of Science\nfrom commercial interests is also a fundamental issue.\nWe should keep in mind the functions of a university, and keep our\npriorities well in check.\nWell, I could also rant on the dangers of the GATS agreement on liberalisation of educational services\nbut...\nM. Cand\nAdd Some Top Up Fees\nI am absolutely appa led by the\nevents of the last few days and the\nhastiness with which the rector of\nmy alma mater, Imperial College, is\ntrying to push through his own\nagenda. I hope sincerely that the\nentire college shows their disgust at\nthe proposals and the way in which\nboth staff and students are being\ntotally walked-over.\nImperial College is an outstanding\nplace to study but I fear that if we do\nnot speak out, it will soon turn into\nSir Richard's dream - a mega- institution for the elite, where money\nand not intelligence dictate who gets\nin. Imperial is a top institution,\nrespected the world over, for its academic excellence. It is not a blue-chip company; it is an institution\nwhich has built its reputation thanks\nto the abilities of the people it\n\"On behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union, I would\nlike to thank all the students who attended the\nprotest, and all those who\nhelped co-ordinate the\nevent\"\nSen Ganesh, Union President\nFor more information on student fees, please go to\nwww.union.ic.ac.uk/protest\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

They were out in\nfull force tonight, all ready to take the beats by\nthe horns and dance until the grins dropped off\ntheir faces.\nArriving at 11pm, with the venue already\npacked, I made my way directly to Room 2 to\nwatch the likes of Grooverider, Adam F and\nAndy C make it impossible not to be moved by\nthe atmosphere. A good hard dance, a few random conversations with random conversation-a lists, a nice chill out on the stairs, a thorough\nappreciation of the water fountains; all in all, a textbook Fabriclive experience which, even if\nyou are not a fan of the music, should not be\nmissed. Dan B. Fabric\nSaturday @ Fabric\nFabric's Saturday night birthday celebrations\ntook place in fine fashion by doing what they\ndo every Saturday; putting on a night of deep\ntech y house.\nIt all really started when Philadelphia's finest, Josh Wink, came on at 2:30am and\nhammered the crowd with a brilliant set of\npounding mechanical, iron hard beats, with\nscreeching acid overtones. His prowess was\nevident: he would cut out the bass for a few\nseconds so the crowd could take a breather,\nbefore letting it kick in again to an eruption of\ncrowd appreciation.\nIf that wasn't your thing, DJ Cosmo in Room\n3 was playing a great but slightly weird set of\n80's electro, jacking', tech y body popping hiphop sounds (you had to be there) which\nhad everyone doing \"the robot\".\nThe climax came at 4am when we headed\nover to Room 2 to catch Slam, who were playing an inspired mix of funky/party/Detroit\nsounding techno. By 5:30am we had danced\ntoo hard, had no energy left and had to leave\nto the sound of Dirty by Dirty: \"obscene, dirty,\nfilthy, immoral, ah yeah!\" Alexander H.

It is the\nclub's attention to detail with its design and\nits state-of-the-art sound system which guarantee its popularity as a venue.

Let us not lose sight of this\nfact, otherwise I fear that Sir\nRichard's latest, corporate ex peri ment, will be a disaster for the UK,\nsignalling the end of the right to a top-class university education for all,\nand a slippery slope towards a two-tiered, segregated society such as\nthe United States, where ethics are\nsecond to the dollar.\nFor a man whose CV professes\n\"humble beginnings\", it appears\nthat Sir Richard suffers from severe\namnesia. Someone as clearly talented as himself would probably never\nhave had the chance to achieve his\nfull potential if our education system\nwas self-funding and socially ex clu sive, like it is in the USA. Hence it is\nvery worrying indeed that most pe o ple, except for Sir Richard himself,\nknow that intelligence has no\nrespect for money and social-class.\nYet it is what has made Imperial\nCollege great. So why may we ask\nare we allowing such a man to conduct his get-rich-quick experiment\non Imperial, and be at the helm of\nthis ill-planned voyage to certain dis-aster?\nAnd StirDear Felix,\nWhat is going on at Imperial?\nDon't let them introduce top up fees\nof up to \u00a310,500!!! I most certainly\nwould not have come to study at\nImperial if I had to pay that much.\nMost people would not be able to\nafford it!\nWhat's this about a merger with\nUCL? In the news I read that the\nmerger was for academic reasons\nand not economic. They also\nclaimed that they not 'anticipate'\nany staff reductions. Do you believe\nthem?\nWhen I was at Imperial, the\nmajority of students didn't care\nmuch about College politics and I assume it's still pretty much the\nsame. I am as guilty of this as most.\nBut I think that this is the time for IC\nstudents (past and present) to come\nout of the woodwork (and the bar)\nand really let their opinions be\nknown! Don't just let the senior\nmanagement just walk all over you!\nI say NO to top up fees and NO to\nthe merger!\nJason Wong. (Elec.

The real\nthreat has been successfully swiped\nfrom our minds with this cunning\ntrickery.\nWhat kind of pompous ass is it\nthat says \"whoever wants to drag\nthe university of london tag can go\nto brunel\"??? I very much hope that\nthis university is not going to fall into\nthis kind of elitist \"we don't give a fuck about anyone else cause\nthey're not as good as us\", which is\nwhy many people dislike Oxford and\nCambridge..\nI hope that was coming indeed\nfrom the 70's, and that this idiot\nwas an aberration even in his own\nage.\nYours, Physics\nDear Felix,\nThis is an open letter to say an\nenormous thank you to all the students and staff who turned out for\nthe silent protest last friday morning.\nDespite the early hour, cold wind\nand persistent rain there were at\nleast 700 people lining the route all\nthe way from Sherfield to the\nRector's residence at 170 Queen's Gate.\nThose present at the meeting of\nCollege Council say that the\nGovernors and academic staff were\nimpressed by the large numbers\npresent and the good behaviour\nthroughout the protest.\nAlthough the decision on tuition\nfees still went through, it did so with\na significant amendment in our\nfavour and an acknowledgement\nfrom the Rector that the views of\nstudents can't just be brushed aside.\nWe're not going to let this end\nhere - if you want to get involved\nwith the second phase of the campaign against increased tuition fees,\nvisit http://union.ic.ac.uk/no2 fees/ for more information.\nIn summary, the protest made a positive difference to the outcome of\nthe meeting, so well done and thank\nyou for coming along!\nEtienne, Katherine, Oliver,\nMustafa, Jude and the rest of the\nProtest Co-or dina tors....

It's not the complete set, and he used Midfield\nGeneral to mix this album as\nwell. The album contains songs\nwhich are eclectic but still have\nsome of his house roots.\nThe album kicks off with\nMidfield General's Reach Out, a nice chilling song which has a rasping chorus with Linda Lewis\nwho sounds similar to Macy\nGray. It mixes to the only Fatboy\nSlim track Talkin 'bout my Baby\n(not including his involvement\nwith the Might Dub Katz). It's not his strongest track but it\ndoes mix well.\nThe track selection is filled\nwith songs which I 've heard but\ndidn't know the name of, for\nexample Tim Deluxe's It Just\nWon't Do. Other notable tracks\nare the classic Groove Armada's Superstylin' and the mind\nnumbing ly overplayed X Press\n2's Lazy. The compilation seems\nto dip at the end with songs\nwhich aren't up to the same\nquality as the beginning.\nHowever, it does pick up, with\nthe surprise inclusion of the All\nSaints' Pure Shores, which is an\nexcellent song to finish a set\nright next to the beach..\nIf you went to this gig, you\nmight want to buy this album for\nnostalgic reasons. Otherwise it's a tidy compilation which really\ndepends if you're a fan of\nNorman Cook's taste in music.\nOscar\nCOMPETITION TIME\nIf you fancy getting your hands on a copy of the Sugababes brand new\nsingle, then here's your chance.\nThe Sugababes first album was:-a) One Touch\nb) Sugababes\nPlease email your answer, with\nyour name, year and department\nto music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nby Thursday 31st of October.\nCabaret Voltaire\nNag Nag Nag - Mixes Nova mute\n4/5\nAt first I used to hate that kind of\nrecycled albums; using old stuff,\nasking several DJs to collaborate\nin order to make them squelch\nthat little bit out of the anonymity,\nmaking shiny new money. With\nthis album, I can drop a very little\npiece of my prejudice. For those\nwho don't know, Cabaret\nVoltaire's NagNagNag, released in\n79, is a real punk song with\nBontempi beats instead of drums,\nadditive voice samples and electronic guitar-like layer. The vocals\nare also industrially modified; we\ncan say that it's a Kraut-rock\nsong. As the term 'innovators' has\nrecently been applied to Cabaret\nVoltaire, it would have been\nregressive to ask some existing socalled punk bands to cover\nNagNagNag.\nWhat makes that song (and the\nband, I suppose) so fascinating is\nthat it is located at a limit, a bor-der. In the course of the album,\nthe DJs try to recreate that enjoyable feeling of transition (the first\ntwo versions are remixes by Tiga\n& Zyntherius) or use elements set\ndown by Cabaret Voltaire to create a new current electronic piece\nand finally go across the border\n(like the last version).\nThe third (remix by Akufen) is\nreally pleasant. They use the gui-tar-like part as a noisy, dull under\nlayer for sketches of the original\nvoice. The beat is a kind of boss a rhythm, very sweet and she (or\nhe) inserts fly's farts and other\nvery appreciable crummy sounds.\nThe piece is pretty cool and\nmakes this album rather not bad,\nabove all for the C.V. fiends.\nNIC\nSingles\nThe Vines - Outtatheway\nThe Vines are still riding high\nwith this, their third single\nfrom the highly acclaimed\nalbum Highly Evolved. There is\na lot of hype behind this band\nwith many critics drawing parallels between them and\nNirvana, but not to worry too\nmuch, a lot of the praise they\nhave received is justified. This\nsingle isn't as catchy as Get\nFree but it is not a problem. It's still something good to shout\nalong to. These guys will be\nplaying in London at the begining of next month, so go get\nyourself a ticket and see what\nail the hype is about.\n4/5\nSean the dude\nBritish Sea Power - Childhood\nMemories\nThis is a very pretty song, and\nsomewhat reminiscent of\nFleetwood Mac. They keep it\nquite chilled and pull it off\nnicely, even saving some mad\nnoises for the end of the song.\nSimple lyrics and pleasant\nsounds await you. An original\nand unique band. Check them\nout.\n4/5\nLittle Hell - Everybody's Cursed\nThere doesn't really seem to be\nanything new here - it's a bit\nglam, with a nice clan gy bassline and cutting guitars\nbut that is where it ends. I wish it was toned down a bit.\nIt's very hard to take seriously.\nI'm sure this must be a spoof\nband because the lyrics are so\nridiculous: \"I 've been saving to\nfill your grave in, so here's a bag of dirt\".\nAbout 20 years too late...\nSorry guys.\n2/5\nRobin\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk You Know You're Right\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Amnesty\nInternational\n0 9\nIn 1961, two Portuguese students were sentenced to prison\nfor seven years. Not a month, not\na year but seven years. And the\nreason? For raising their glasses\nin a toast to freedom. In 1961, a British lawyer, Peter Benenson,\nread about these students and on\nthe 28th of May he wrote an article for the Observer newspaper\nentitled 'The Forgotten Prisoners'\nwhich was an appeal for amnesty\nfor men and women held in jail\nfor their political or religious\nviews. The appeal was also printed in other papers across the\nworld, and Amnesty International\nwas bom.\nWhat is Amnesty about?\nAmnesty International has\ngrown into the largest voluntary\nhuman rights organisation in the\nworld with an organised presence\nin 72 countries. Today, Al has\nmore than a million members\nworldwide and students play a crucial role in its organisation. In\nfact it relies a lot on the commit-ment, motivation and energy of\nstudents to achieve success in the\ncoming years.\nOften people take part by writing letters to governments in cases\nwhere people have been wrongfully detained. Sometimes there is a good end result and sometimes\nunfortunately it doesn't turn out\nthe way we hope. But people\ndon't give up because for every\nletter written, every bit of awareness raised, Al members provide\nhope for victims of human rights\nabuses around the world. One\nrecent example was General\nGallardo. On 7 February 2002,\nGeneral Gallardo, a prisoner of\nconscience detained for over eight\nPart-Time Staff Needed\nUnion staff needed to work in the\nShop, Bars, Marketing Office\nand as Stewards.\nMany variable hours available\n\u00a34.20 per hour plus benefits\nTraining provided.\nContact Michelle on 020 8594-8060\nix48060 Email: union@ic.ac.uk.\nimperial\n\u2022 college\nunion\nWork for yourself.

Amnesty\nmembers have campaigned for\nhis release over many years and it\nis this on going pressure on the\nauthorities that has contributed to\nsecure his release. General\nGallardo's family have expressed\ntheir gratitude for all our help:\n\"We are all very happy that our\nfather has been released and we\nare profoundly grateful to\nAmnesty International. Without\nyour support my father's release\nwould not have been possible.\"\nWe have an Amnesty\nInternational group at Imperial\nwhere we meet up every\nThursday to write letters for particular cases like General\nGallardo.

    "content": "0 6 COLUMN FELIX A wandering we shall go\nSouth of Snowdonia, only one\nmountain range approaches\n915m in Britain: the Brecon\nBeacons. The Brecon Beacons\nNational Park consists of the\nBlack Mountains to the East, the\nBeacons in the centre and, con-fu singly, the Black Mountain in\nthe West. On Friday night, 11 of\nus met up at the union with this\nnational park as our destination.\nDespite the inadequacies of the\nunion bus, we set off in good\ntime for the hills. The traffic was\nheavy and Wales felt very far\naway, even further due to the\nlack of radio in the bus, but we\nkept spirits high, and were soon\nat the c hippy in Caerleon. A small\nhop further and we arrived at our\nluxury accommodation in Brecon.\nWe said hello to the other residents in the bunkhouse and a few\nbev vies ensued, after which we\nwere all pretty tired and retired to\nour beds.\nWe were all woken by a beautiful sunrise in the morning, apart\nfrom some of the girls who were\nwoken by Chris in his boxers mistaking their room for his.\nApparently this was not such a beautiful sight! Our walk started\nfrom Llantony in the Black\nMountains. This is a picturesque\nvillage with a very impressive\nruined priory - the stuff of picture\npostcards. We climbed up a steep path to the top of the ridge\nand on to the famous Offa's Dyke\npath - built to keep the\nWelshmen out of England. The\nviews into England were lovely,\nand as we walked along in the\nsunshine it really couldn't have\nbeen more pleasant. Before too\nlong we arrived at the first trig\ne sting, giving us nice views over\nthe vale and surrounding hills.\nThe pub beckoned and we\ndropped back into the valley for a pint, and a chat with the less\nthan sober locals. The country\nroads on the drive back to the\nbarn proved to be too much of a challenge for the bus, resulting in\nit getting stuck in the mud. With\na bit of brute strength, the men\npoint - Hay Bluff - just in time for\ndinner. Revived and full of energy,\nwe climbed up to the next trig\npoint after lunch. This one was\nthe highest point of the day, and\nwas named 'The Lord of\nHereford's Knob'. I kid you not.\nThe ridge on the way back was\nsharper and therefore more inter-managed to push us out and\nthankfully we could carry on\nhome. Thanks guys! On our\nreturn to the barn we all ate too\nmuch curry and Rich and Chris\nhad a chilli eating competition. It\nreally is amusing to see grown\nmen cry!\nWaking on the Sunday we\ncould hear the rain bashing on\nthe window. High winds were\nforecasted - not a day to go up on\nthe tops then. Instead we drove\nto Pontneddfechan and walked\nalong the valley to the potholes at\nYstradfelte, which made a perfect\nlunch stop. The walk back in the\nafternoon included the main\nattraction of the day, where the\npath passes behind a waterfall.\nSeeing as we were all already\nsoaked from the rain, no one\nminded getting wetter and it took\nsometime before the novelty of\nthis waterfall wore off.\nUnfortunately, all good things\ncome to an end, and it was time\nto head back. The lack of radio\non the way back got too much\nand everyone decided to make\ntheir own entertainment by\nsinging a variety of classic songs\nfrom the Beatles and Queen. It\ndidn't sound good, and the drivers contemplated the various different methods of suicide. We\nstopped off at the Crown and\nHorns for dinner, where we, by\npure fluke, bumped into ex-pre si dent Sam, before we headed for\nhome and our much-needed\nbeds.\nInterested in Fellwanderers?\nVisit:\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/fell wanderers And Alex Said...\nBeing a student is all about coping\nwith a small budget, and if you're\nespecially thrifty, you can usually\nstretch out a year's student loan to\ncover your expenses in London for\nabout three weeks.\nAs a very old man once mumbled to me when I asked him for\nfinancial advice, \"look after the\npenis, and the pandas will look\nafter themselves\". I don't know\nwhat he meant either, and it cost\nme my job at the local zoo, but\nperhaps he was telling me it was a good idea to save money wherever\nI can (and not, as I thought, to\nexpose myself in the penguin\nenclosure).\nSo, how to stem the flow of cash\nfrom your wallet into the outside\nworld? First, get your food expenditure down to a minimum.\nVegetables are cheap. I bought an\nonion the other day. I got home\nand looked at the receipt, and it\ncost 8p. Now, on its own, that\nwasn'ta very nice meal at all, and\nI probably should\nhave bought some\nindigestion tablets to\ngo with it, but at\nleast it hardly cost\nme anything.\nSecond, scrimp on\nrent by living in a rat-infested cesspool. Being London,\nthis means you could have had a fifty-bedroom palace in Leeds for\nthe same amount, but try not to\nworry. You can blow all that hard-saved cash by drowning the sorrows of your miserable existence\ndown the pub. Excellent.\nOf course, poverty breeds crime,\nwhich is probably why I was\nplagued by theft when I was in\nhalls. I was particularly distressed\nby the loss of four Cornish Pasties.\nWhen I noticed my milk was going\nmissing, I devised a cunning plan.\nNo doubt several\nof you are also experiencing milk loss, so\ndo what I did: wait\nuntil you've only got\na few centimetres of\nmilk left and dilute it with water\nuntil you've got half a bottle full.\nThis way you don't end up wasting\nmuch real milk, and it looks pretty\nmuch the same. Next, take your\nl kg tub of table salt and pour as\nmuch in as you can be bothered\nto. Shake it up, and voila. If you've\nput enough salt in, even a splash\nin some tea will be heartily dis-gusting. The only thing left to do is\ntempt your milk thief, and there is\nnothing more tempting to somebody who is looking to steal some\nmilk than a big sign attached to\nsome milk, saying \"PLEASE DO\nNOT STEAL MY MILK\". So, try\nthat. No need to wait around - you\nshould be able to hear the retching\nfrom your bedroom.\nOf course it's not just students\nwho face financial hardship - the\nrecent announcement of the plan\nfor top-up fees shows Imperial is\non a diet of Tesco Value Beans too.\nThe rector thinks the answer is\ncharging students more, but here's a crazy idea - why doesn't College\nspend less? If it means cutting out\na few lectures, so be it. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. Alex\nCash!\nfelix@ic.ac.uk Write to us to get your article published..\n\n"

A bit of trip to get to\ntheir grounds, but we were there\nnice and early and got ready for\nthe game. We started off a bit\nrusty, but after the first 5 minutes,\nwe came back to take complete\ncontrol of the game.Everyone was\nworking hard and putting in the\neffort, and we started looking really dangerous going forward and\ncreated a pile of chances, but just\ncouldn't finish them. Finally,\nabout 35 minutes into the game,\nAlan cleverly took a free kick while\nthey were sorting out their wall,\ncurling the ball over it, making it\n1-0.\nWe didn't manage to score\nagain that half, but knew we could\ndo better than that, so we came\nout having decided to win this\none. Our second goal didn't take\nlong, with Mark delivering a free\nkick to the far post, Alan linking\nup to finish it with a power head-er. 2-0! We kept our foot down,\nscoring again within a couple of\nminutes. Some great movement in\nthe middle and down the right, a good ball in from Mark, a set up\nby Oli and 3-0 it was by Joss. We\nwere all over them and knew we\ncould score more. Jeff, who'd come on for Anis, got the ball\ninside their box, smashing past\nthe keeper...4-0. There was still\nsome time left in the game, and\nwe had to make something of it.\nMark, going past everyone down\nthe right, put a great ball in the\nbox for Mathan to put the 5th one\naway, bottom right corner. A couple of minutes before the end we\ngot another one, Mark's brilliant\nthrough ball to Jeff, who brought it\ndown nicely and finished it easily,\nto end it 6-0.\nGood performance all round,\nbut they weren't the best side\nwe've played against, so no need\nto get carried away...\nKent II 0 - 1 IC III\nThe team had to leave an hour\nearly to travel to Canterbury via\ntube, train and bus, and at the\nend we were still left with a long\nwalk to find the club house and\npitch.\nThe team were immediately put\ninto a state of shock by Gary\ndeciding to prance around the\nchanging rooms wearing only his\nnewly bought black man thong -not a pretty sight I assure you. On\nthe pitch IC started slowly, unable\nto keep possession and for long\nperiods of time and we spent most\nof the first half chasing the ball.\nChris Jermyn strained his thigh at\nthe beginning of the first half and\nwith Henry being our only substitute, a straight swap was made\nand we had our midfield captain\nplaying up front, or at least\nattempting to as I often found\nmyself further up the field. Our\ndefence held strong and for all\ntheir possession Kent made very\nfew chances and were unable to\nscore. This took us into half time\nat nil nil. We were tired and knew\nthat we had to get more of the ball\nin the second half and keep pos-session, however we still felt confident that we could go out there\nand win the match. We started\nthe second half brightly and we\nscored early on with Henry toe\npoking the ball through the keepers legs. This lead to another spell\nof very little possession, however\nour fitness didn't seem too bad\nand we were able to chase back\nand defend well. Towards the end\nwe had another decent chance,\nthis time Henry was unfortunate\nand the keeper made a good save.\nTowards the end the match was\ntense and we just managed to\nhold on for a well deserved away\nwin, which was a good reward for\nall our efforts.\nReading I12 IC I BUSA has always proved to be a tough competition, and our first\ngame in it this year proved to be\nno exception.\nWe had to make our way to\nReading. Got there a bit a late, as\nthey gave us no instructions to get\nto their pitch, which we thought\nwas very nice of them! Got out\nreally fired up for the game but\ndidn't start as well as we might\nhave done. They started better\nthan us and took control of the\ngame for the first 15 minutes. It\nwas about then we decided to\nstart playing a bit of football. We\nevened up the game and looked\ndangerous when going forward. It\nwas clear this was going to be a tough one and we had to fight to\nwin it. We threatened them a couple of times, but they managed to\nscore first, a good move and finish\nto be fair. But we weren't gonna\ngive up just like that. We fought,\nand managed to pull one back. A well deserved goal, quick pass\nfrom Tim to Left Back Ant,\nStraight to Joss, switching play to\nthe right to Mark, who combined\nwith Anis beautifully, to score.\nThat was how the first half ended.\nIn the second half we came on\nreally determined to fight harder,\nas winning the game was what we\nwere there for. We were now looking a lot better than them and\nmuch more likely to score. And so\nit was! A sweet chip ball by Oli\nbehind the defence to Nathan,\nwho took it on and finished easily\nand confidently past the keeper.\nAfter this we didn't let our performance drop although they did\nput pressure on us. They had one\nor two chances, but so did we.\nNeither of us managed to score,\nso 2-1 it was!\nFirst BUSA game, a convincing\nwin against a very good side.\nKeep this up boys and lots more\nwill come!\nRob Dee ring appearing in the Comedy Club\nThursday, October31 Doors 7 : 3 0 , Show 8 : 3 0\nUnion \u00a3 3 / Guests \u00a3 3 . 5 0 / P2P \u00a3 2 . 5 0\nimperial\ncollege\nunion\nTickets available\nin advance from the\nUnion Reception\nsport.felix@ic.ac.uk Please send us your match reports!\n\n"

Like it or not, we are here\nand it'll take a while before we\ngo away again. Let's start with\nFreshers Week.\nWell, another year begins and,\nyes, I know this is a bit late. So\nwhat? We all like a bit of variety.\nFreshers Week for us country\nbumpkins down in Wye is still a big thing, even though student\nnumbers are low. This year, with\na first year intake of only 55 (8\nof which are blok es( Help us!)),\nit has been a challenge. But, we\ngave it a go.\nMonday saw the infamous JSF\ndisco. For those of you who don't know, the JSF (or Jock Strap\nFarmers) is one of our drinking\nclubs, described as a group of\nguys who \"work on being complete yo bs, don't know the meaning of a quiet drink and take\npleasure in drinking anything\nwhich resurfaces\". Their\nFreshers Night is always a bit of\na mess and this year wasn'ta big\nexception. Our poor Union Bar\nfound itself covered in trees,\nshavings and beer cans aplenty,\nbut once the ... er ... civilised\nact of... well ... let's class it as\nanatomy chun de ring for the sake\nof the press (I'm sure you know\nwhat I mean) got going and the\nYard was brought out, it turned\ninto a bit of mess.\nTuesday, Scottish Reeling,\nawarded Adam Trehane with the\nBest Drunken Injury Award for\nmanaging to injure himself in\nclassic style and still being able\nto dance on.\nWednesday was a pub crawl in\nCanterbury, as usual, with no\nmajor occurrences, except for the\nFreshers slowly getting used to\nbeing out of the recesses they\ncall their rooms.\nThursday night, a night spent\nin a local pub, The Compasses,\nwas a bit of a milestone, wasn't it Andy? Yes, that's right. Some\nof you know him, others don't, but Andy Shore, our respectable\nUnion President, did a classic.\nArmed with two friends, a Fresher and no mobile with a sig-nal, Andy decided to walk the\ngood 5 miles across the Kent\nCountryside over barbed wire\nand through someone's conservatory. About 2.30am, after\nfalling asleep in the middle of the\nroad, our Welfare Officer (Maria)\ngot a phone call. When asked,\n\"Where are you?\" Andy replies,\n\"at aT junction\". Nice one.\nFriday, the Freshers Ball with a theme of Lord Of The Rings,\nwas, I am told, a good night.\nUnfortunately, I was kidnapped\nby a bottle of wine and plenty of\nvodka beforehand and, well, I wish someone would tell me the\nrest. All I know was I fell up the\nstairs and woke up in pain.\nOops. Apparently, everyone loved\nthe ball and it was nice to see all\nthe Freshers finally in the open,\neven if Ross was in a clown suit\nas the Garter's mascot. Bless.\nNevertheless, it was a good\nweek. We'll get those little people out eventually, but, oh, how\nwe suffer.\nI was planning to put sports\nresults etc. in this as well, but\nsince no one's actually written\nanything you'll have to make do\nwith this.

Though for\nthe RSM it was a normal\nWednesday at work, having won\ntheir fourth game in a row, now\ntopping the ULU 2nd Division.\nIt all started beautifully with the\ncheap return fare to the football\nground and it then went from\ngood to brilliant when RSM scored\nthree quick goals in succession.\nThe first, from the legendary midfielder James Dean, the second\nfrom Paul Talbot, our own bulldog\nwho never gives up the chase,\nwho with his back to goal, somehow pulled it out the bag to spin\nand shoot. Before the end of the\nfirst half another one of our legendary players - James Stewartran on to a long ball, and flicked it\nover the goalie. To be fair, a Medic\nwould have cleared it, had he not\nfallen on his arse.\nSecond half, storming Gareth\nNortham ran through the entire\nmedic team and when he ran out\nof pitch decided to pull one back\nto a Mr. Kan Niwho who slotted\nhome a beautiful side foot volley.\nThe fifth and final goal was scored\nby Rob \"Shampoo Officer\"\nThomas, when after a handball in\nthe box, he stepped up to place\nthe ball in the bottom right hand\ncorner off the penalty spot, a maz ingly.

    "content": "FILM FELIX Come one, come all to the second in the series\nof hastily thrown together Felix Film reviews!\nFingers crossed, by this time next week you\nwill be reading a well organised, informative\nand easy to understand set of up-to-date movie\narticles. There may even be one or two interesting articles. Perhaps the sheer volume of\ncopy will shoulder its way onto a second page.\nPerhaps.\nFor the time being though (i.e. this week) the\nlevel of work put in by your hard working but\nshockingly green film editor has been limited\nby happenings in The Real World. Which is\nbang out of order I know, but such is life. So\nwhat does all this gibberish mean? No xXx\nreview I'm afraid. No K19 review either. Nor is\nthere a review of Red Dragon or even\nHalloween Resurrection.\nI haven't been to the pictures in over a week\nso you're stuck with cop-out DVD and video\nreviews. Sorry to all of you without either -keep an eye out for the TV premieres or something ;)\nOn the bright side, it's Halloween next\nThursday, so all the reviews are of appropriately gory and blood-chilling ly scary horror\nmovies. Enjoy!!\n'OtrTOg Soon\nRING\nOk, in what can only be described as a vain attempt to push back the boundaries of\nfilm reviewing, I will now proceed to watch\nthe \"Scariest Movie Ever\", as recommended\nby my horror-movie loving friends - Hideo\nNakata's \"Ring\" (cheap in Virgin, btw). I will\nthen, in a thoroughly petrified state, try and\nfill you in on the details. Its 3a m,I'm alone\nin the house, the lights are off... wish me\nluck....\nWell, ninety minutes later I'm still here.\nThe television is still in the room, but I am\ntwitching a bit and I fear sleep may be a little hard to come by this morning. I 've already\ndecided I 'll wait for the sun to come up\nbefore I go to the loo...\nThe movie centres around a Japanese\nurban myth involving a videotape - anyone\nwho watches the tape dies horribly. Ring\n(also known as Ringu) is a fantastic suspense filled film that had me scared silly\nthroughout. There are a few slow patches,\nbut the sting in the tail will have you burrowing behind the sofa.\nThe American remake (cleverly titled \"The\nRing\") was released in the U.S. earlier this\nyear and is scheduled for a December release\nover here. I'm not sure how well a remake\nwill suit this movie, it's one where much of\nthe appeal derives from its very particular\nstyle. For example, the Rollerball remake\nwas entertaining but nowhere near as\nintense and effective as the original. Ring\nhas planted seeds of paranoia in my head - a terrifying piece of work. Subtitled Japanese\nhorror may not be your cup of tea, but I urge\nyou to try this one for size this Halloweenit's the perfect movie for a dark, lonely night.\nRing is out now, Cert 18 on DVD and video\nBLADE II\nThe Daywalker returns for the second\nmovie in a series that is sure to be a franchise before long. Not that I'm saying this is\na bad thing, mind. I love Snipes and reckon\nthat Blade was the best thing he'd done -aside from Demolition Man (yes, i really did\nlike that movie) - until this.\nOur Wes reprises his role of Blade - a half\nhuman half-vampire cross breed - in this violent and fast paced fantasy horror. On the\nface of it, this one hasn't got a great deal\ngoing for it. Unknown director, obviously trying to cash in on the success of the original,\nsame y plot, one third of Bros as the main\nbad guy and so on. But somehow all this\nadds up to an utterly fantastic ride, with\nsome superbly choreographed fight\nsequences (heavy on the Wire-Fu and SFX,\nso steer clear if you're not a fan) and a surprisingly enticing story, which sees Blade\nforced into a truce with the Vampire Nation\nafter a new mutual threat is discovered in the\nshape of Luke Goss and his hybrid vamps.\nAnd yes, Luke actually makes a convincing\nbad guy - its worth seeing just for that spectacle alone.\nIf you do get your hands on the DVD ver-sion, you will be treated to two superb commentaries (one featuring a frank and honest\naccount from first-time director Del Toro, the\nother featuring Snipes and the writer, David\nGoyer) as well as a treasure trove of deleted\nscenes, storyboard s, documentaries, inter-views... all of which have commentary provided by the director Guillermo Del Toro. A fun movie ideal for Halloween and a packed\nDVD. Heartily recommended!\nBlade II is out now, Cert 18 on DVD and\nvideo\n28 MVS UTEB-.\nAlex Garland? Danny Boyle? An undead\nLeonardo DiCaprio?

    "content": "0 4 COLUMN FELIX Editorial\nEven as we speak, I am being\nreminded of a time when I was,\nand I quote, \"deeply pissed off and\nangry\" during the last summer\nterm. I don't remember why, but so\nit must be, and apparently in that\ntime I wrote a suitably offensive\neditorial that totally failed to raise\nany sort of controversy at all. Last\nweek I feel I did a similar thing, but\npolitically instead of personally, and\nagain not one letter of abuse.\nYou're all either very open minded,\nvery polite, or lazy. I know which\nmy money is on.\nSo in an attempt to make my life\nmore interesting (I'm going to do a PhD one day to study what the\nmaximum amount of interest one\nlife can take is) I'm going to be very\nnormal this week. Or so I intend.\nTo start with, I'm going to tell you\nabout a website. I very rarely do\nthis, and were it not for the fact\nthat I'm positively avoiding talking\nabout anything political, I would\nprobably put it somewhere else,\nbut, as it is, here it shall be in my\nvery own editorial. It's called\nwww.go number. net, and I really\nhaven't been paid to talk about it: I just think it's a really good idea.\nIt's basically like having your own\nbusiness card on the web, where\nyou can put all sorts of bits of information about yourself (mostly for\nkeeping in contact at the moment),\ndifferent bits of which can be\nviewed by the whole world, or just\nby your mates. They've started by\ntrying to sell this to students,\nbecause your details change the\nwhole time, but with this, you keep\nthe same ID on the website for life\n(and you only pay once), and then\nyou can change all the info in there\nas often as you want.\nI'm not usually easily taken in,\nbut I liked the idea, and the website is nice too, so go and have a look at it, is my advice. There are\nposters all around college you can\nlook at too, if you're so inclined.\nIncidentally if any company is\nnow reading this and asks me to\n'boost' their product, I won't. So now onto something else (I wonder if I 've offended anyone yet,\nexcept Al, of course.) Female e roti ca. I 've been thinking about this\nrecently, and have discovered that\nthere is no erotica (what men call\nporn) for girls to look at. I have\nfound (but not in the way you're\nthinking) that most women don't like the same stuff that men do,\nand prefer something with slightly\nmore story line and romance. So\nresearching this (for purely intellectual reasons, of course), I turned to\nthe friend in an hour of need, the\ninternet, which furnished me with\nexactly nothing. Now I know girls\nhave sex drives. And I suspect that\nvisual stimulus can be... well...\nstimulating. So why is there nothing for the discerning female ero-t ophile? To counter this, I have decided to\nstart a revolution, or perhaps my\nown company, to provide for this\nhole in the market, and am asking\nyou, mostly the girls, admittedly, to\nget involved in the largest female\nerotica based survey the college\nhas ever seen! Although I'm not\nreally sure how.\nTalk about anticlimax. This has\nall just come to me as I 've been\nwriting this, so I'm not really organised in my head with respect to\nhow this would work, but I'm getting pretty psyched about it, I can\ntell you.\nSo, if you (male or female) have\nany ideas about the sort of questions I should ask, or if you just give\nthe smallest most remote flying fig\nabout the idea, then e mail me at\nFelix on felix@ic.ac.uk where I will\nbe waiting to see if a single person\nreplies.\nThen I will create the survey, and\nthere will be a huge prize as an\nincentive for bearing your deepest\ndarkest fantasies to me, a physics\ngraduate: but I met a girl once,\nhonest, g uv 'nor.\nWhile I am serious, it's worth\nnoting that I seem to be much better at being offensive when I'm not\nreally trying...\nCome and find\nyour future!\n2 days\n4 rooms\n97 companies\nand thousands of job vacancies!\nm Wednesday& Thursday, November6&7, l lam4p m Throughout the Union Building and in the Beit Quad, Prince Consort Rd.\nVisit the website from this Monday, www.union.ic.ac.uk/careers fair for company de tai felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "Southside Demolition\nSouthside's much-publicised renovation\n(Felices ad nausea m) may give way to its total\ndemolition in a new plan drawn up by College.\nThe landmark building, much maligned by\nresidents, currently houses 390 students during term-time but has become steadily less\nhabitable with each passing year. Plans to tear\ndown the building have been thwarted by its\nGrade II listed status: The structure is considered to be exemplary of its style. The result is\nthat refurbishment would require a huge\ninvestment by College to maintain original features while maintaining the infrastructure necessary for students to live there.\nThe Southside refurbishment plan has\nrepeatedly slipped from its 2001 schedule due\nmainly to funding problems. However, despite\nfinancing issues, work had been brought forward to 2003-2004 due to grave concerns\nthat the \"critical infrastructure\" may fail before\nthe most recent refurbishment date of 2005.\nIn order to pull the building down, Southside\niff//$ \u2022\u2022 4 ' V' Awt*\n' Is Southside: Home of bar and student\nwill have to be de-listed - something the\nCollege will have to agree with the Government\nwhile gaining support from preservation groups\n- certainly the biggest obstacle to the College's plans. Equally, de-listing the building might\nmake refurbishment cheaper, though delaying\nit even further.\nThe proposed replacement building will hold\nover 500 bed-spaces in extreme proximity to\nCollege, much touted as one of the Rector's main residences goals - a useful increase of\n100 beds to offset planned halls sales.\nUnion President Sen Ganesh said that he\nwas \"excited about the provision of higher\nquality residences\" and \"keen for a quick dec i sion\", but expressed concern that the demolition bid may do little other than set back the\ninevitable refurbishment.\nDavid Brookes-Wilson, Head of Estates, was\nreticent to comment before an official decision,\nbut stressed that all the options were \"beneficial to students\".\nThe redevelopment of Eastside (Linstead\nHall and tennis courts) will undoubtedly follow,\nbut with so many slipping deadlines, it remains\nuncertain who will benefit.\nAW\nCynical Sykes Snubs Protest\n650 Imperial students lined the\nroute between the Rector's office\nand 170 Queen's Gate last Friday\nto protest about the proposed\nintroduction of tuition fees for\nImperial College students.\nThere seemed to be some confusion among protesters interviewed by Felix about whether\nthey could be liable for fees - a condition explicitly ruled out by\nthe proposal - but many were\nthere on behalf of the next generation of students.\nThe Rector agreed with Union\nPresident Sen Ganesh in advance\nthat he would walk the protest\nroute, but seemed not to take the\ncrowd very seriously as he smiled\nbroadly during his two minute\nwalk to the College Council meeting where the proposal was to be\npresented.\nAt the meeting, the proposal\nwas approved unanimously apart\nfrom the one vote awarded to the\nUnion delegate. Sen Ganesh said\nthat the protest had \"raised ques-t ions\" at the meeting, but clearly\nhad little effect on the outcome.\nThe fees proposal now awaits\nGovernmental approval.

The idea is\nthat Fabric releases mixes from\ntheir resident DJs and punters\ncan subscribe online to receive\n(at a discount from the real\nretail price) their latest dose of\nbreakbeat through the post.\nGrooverider is the latest to\nreceive the FABRICLIVE treat-ment, and this CD does make\nfor interesting listening.\nCompared to some of the drum\nand bass dross that is churned\nout on a regular basis,\nGrooverider's choice of tracks\nand mixing style (jigsaw mixes,\nVIP dubbing and quick cuts)\nharks back to his early days as\nan acid house impresario.\nThis set starts with some\nblinding tracks {Got Me Burning\nby Peshay and Alien Girl, by Ed\nRush, Optical and Fierce), but\nthe tempo worked up at the start\nseems to almost lose control\nmid-way through, and seriously\nheavy bass beat takes over. The\ntracks get dark and dirty, the\ncrowd - you would imagine - are\ngoing wild, and it is only\ntowards the last third of the set\nthat you get a sense of\nGrooverider's range as a DJ,\nwhen the tracks seem to take on\nan almost schizophrenic quality,\ndodging from laid back, almost\nchilled drum and bass, to men-tal is m on a grand scale!\nStand-out tracks on this CD\nwould have to include Optimus\nPrime's Amen Slag and\nGrooverider's VIP mixes of\nDeadline by Digital and Back\nfor More by Influx Datumtracks that offer both a chill out\nand a party at the same time.\nPerhaps it is the fact that\nGrooverider has been around\nsince the early days - when\nhouse turned into jungle, which\nthen turned into drum and bass.\nPerhaps it's because he's not\nafraid to throw all these styles\ntogether, mix them up and see\nwhat happens. Whatever it is, if\nyou love drum and bass you will\nnot be disappointed. If you can\nonly afford one CD in the FABRICLIVE series, this is the one to\nget!\nKatherine\nSingles\nMoby - In This World\nAnother Moby single, another\nsoulful blues sample, sung by\nanother unknown artist.\nAnyone who's heard Natural\nBlues (and let's face it, who\nhasn't?) will know what to\nexpect. It seems the skin-head-ed songster has discovered a simple formula for chill out tune\nsuccess - gospel tinged vocals,\nsimple piano refrain, dreamy\nbacking strings and relaxed\nhouse beat - and is churning\nout single after single of the\nstuff. Now, don't get me wrong;\nI liked Play as much as the\nnext man, but I just hope he\nruns out of old bluegrass\nrecordings soon, so he can\nstart making something a little\ndifferent.\n3/5\nParva - Hessels\nTom Bell\nThis was good, but not dirty\nand innovative enough for me -like a good power-rock song\nshould. The bass is particularly\nattractively tight, the guitars\nare sharp, totally high-fidelity.\nThe whole song sounds nice\nand nostalgically, like one of\nthose on the debut album of\nSnuff. It seems as though the\nlead singer of Parva wanted to\nmake his song edgier like those\nof Snuff, and in trying to\nachieve that aim, he decided,\nat regular points, to shout gen-t ly. And that's the problem\nbecause his gentle shouts are\nlike flat tyres; the song is working but there is also something\nbothersome. The band act with\nkitsch effect because the anger\nthat the singer tries to express\nis the kind of anger that hits\nyou when you realize that there\naren't any cereals left for your\nbreakfast.\n3/5\nNic\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk There is more to life than being ridiculously good looking!\n\n"

    "content": "[ill 1 8\nMUSIC REVIEWS Live Review\nFELIX The Coral\nShepherd's Bush Empire - Thursday 10th October\nmmm &\nThursday evening, and the\nShepherd's Bush Empire is sold\nout for a band which was totally\nunknown a few months ago.\nFollowing the release of their\ndebut album, this band from\nLiverpool is doing its first UK\ntour. Their music is \"psychedelic\nrock\", a genre ideal for radio\nplay but can songs like\nDreaming of You, their most\nrecent single, have the same\neffect live? That was the big\nquestion before the gig.\nOpening with Spanish Man, a very short but intense song, they\ninvited the London audience into\ntheir imagination-filled world.\nAnd it worked! The six members\ngave an excellent live perform-ance. They displayed no fear on\nstage and showed a maturity\nseldom seen in such young people (the members are aged\nbetween 18 and 21). I don't say\nit was the most entertaining\nconcert I 've been to but they\nplayed their album and that was\nenough. The strength and diversity of their songs made it work.\nFrom the beginning of the\nyear, England has been introduced to new bands such as The\nElectric Soft Parade and The\nMusic; new guys who give a breath of fresh air to the Brit\npop-rock scene after the\nOasis/Blur era. But our boys follow the new fashion of short\ngigs; only 50 minutes from\nbeginning to end. A little too\nshort, perhaps?\nI don't judge an album or a performance instantly, but I believe that a band has to give\nmore on stage than in the stu-dio. The Coral did their show\nand you had to \"take it or leave\nit\". Why no encore? I'm sure\nthat they had other songs to\nplay; there were two new tracks\non their last single! Perhaps\nbecause it was 50 intense minutes full of happiness without\nintermission, I was begging for\nmore. It's too late to see them in\nLondon now. So get the album\nimmediately! Or you will miss\nout on one of the best albums of\nthe year 2002!\nMike\nThe Coral's self-titled debut\nalbum is out in the shops now.\nRichard Ashcroft 3/5\nHuman Conditions\nThe bright summery feeling of\nthe first single, Check The\nMeaning, from his latest album\nis guaranteed to make you\nsmile. The perfect autumn song,\nreminiscent of summer and yet\ncozy enough to make you want\nto dive back under the duvet and\njust listen\nAnd that is exactly what this\nalbum is, 'cozy'. While it doesn't represent a massive departure\nfrom the style Richard Ashcroft\nhad cultivated whilst in The\nVerve and in his previous solo\nreleases, it does offer exactly\nwhat any die-hard fan of northern soul will want - songs with\nstrong melodies and strong sen-time nts. At times Ashcroft is in danger\nof sounding a bit like a new-age\nhippie, singing 'Nature is the\nlaw, baby' to a chilled-out, hazy\nchorus line.\nHowever, the range exhibited\nin this album, from love-ballads\nto songs describing the harsh\nrealities of life, is impressive. It\nacts as an indication of him\nachieving a new level of accomplishment in his craft as a song-writer.\nRichard Ashcroft sings to you\nin this album from the enviable\nvantage point of knowing that\nwhat he has crafted will not only\nbe popular with his loyal fans,\nbut also accessible to the rest of\nthe record-buying public, containing - as it does here - a noticeable polish compared to\nsome of his previous releases,\nwhich had more 'rough and\nreadiness' about them.\nThe combination of guitar\nband music with orchestral\naccompaniment still works well\nand one of the tracks, Bright\nLights, offers a hint of something different - experimentation\nwith new percussion styles\nresulting in an altogether more\ninteresting, complex brand of\nmusic.\nIn this latest album, there is\nan overriding feeling of darkness\nwhich is, unexpectedly, almost\ncomforting. Listening to this is\nlike the return of an old\nfriend....and as the man himself\nsays 'It sure feels like I 've been\nhere before'.\nKatherine\nAlbums\nAll Systems Go - Mon Chi Chi\nAll Systems Go sound exactly\nlike an American high school\nTV show. Normally, this is no\nreason for complaint, but\nthey're Swedish and while\nyou can hear (if you listen\nreally carefully) bits of The\nSoundtrack of Our Lives and\nmaybe even The Hives, they\nstill sound like they belong in\nCalifornia. Sounding like you\nbelong in California typically\nmeans you are a big, dumb,\nvacuous, pop-punk for school\ngirls, which coincidentally is\npretty much how ASG sound.\nThey take the tried and\ntested route of picking three\nchords, playing them in\nslightly differing orders\naround catchy three minute\npop songs without taking\nthemselves seriously at all,\nand it pays off. Instead of the\nusual dirge about girls,\nschool and how things are so\nlike, totally unfair man, they\nsing about big dumb things\nlike motorbikes, robots, girls,\nrevenge and the temporary\nloss of sanity. All of which\nmakes it far less tiresome and\na great deal more enjoyable\nthan the rest of the punk-boy-bands around at the moment.\nIt may not be clever, but it\ncertainly is big.\n3/5\nDom\nI REVIEWERS\nREQUIRED\nI No experience necessary,\nand you get to keep\nwhatever you review.\nI Come to Felix in Beit\nI Quad on Thursdays at\nI1.30 pm or email\nJ music.felix@ic.ac.uk and\nI we'll see if you can do\nbetter than us!\nmusic.fei ix@ ic.ac.uk Come again next week for more news, reviews and interviews!\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX COLUMN03 What's In It For Sykes?\nDuring the last week, I have heard many stories and ideas about the Rector's proposed\nplans for the merger of UCL and IC, the \u00a310k top-up fees, and the damaging effects that\nthese will have on IC. Will the creation of a 'new' University of London wobble the delicate\nbalance already held, putting the smaller colleges into an endless spiral of decline? Why do\nwe want to dilute our good reputation with\nthat of a University from which some of us\nreceived an unconditional offer to study, whilst\naccepting an AAB offer from IC?\nConversely, many people have nothing but\npraise for the plans. 'Fantastic!' 'Well done,\nthe best thing that Imperial could do, merging\nwith UCL.' Now we'll be a world class institution able to compete 'on an international market platform', attracting new students will\nremain as lucrative as it has been until now.\nEven arts students will be able to come to IC,\nand we'll sort out our money problems in one\nfell swoop, too!\nSo whilst there has been considerable\ndebate on the effects of all this, it seems\nnobody has addressed the causes. Why does\nthe Rector want to merge IC and UCL, and\nintroduce top-up fees, and what's in it for him?\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, previously\nChair of the board of GlaxoSmithKline (g sk), formerly GlaxoWellcome, formerly Glaxo,\npresided over the merger of GlaxoWellcome\nand SmithKline Beecham. Even the Wellcome\nTrust (later pic) was not immune to him, being\nbought up in 1995 by Glaxo. He has a history\nof merging organisations, so his philosophy is\nvery much 'bigger is better'.\nAt least he can send his own kids to IC for\n\u00a310ka year, since for 2000 and 2001, he\nwas paid a staggering \u00a32.16m by g sk. But the\nRector does not make as much money at IC as\nhe used to at g sk, and merging with UCL is\nunlikely to massively increase his own salary\nas Rector, currently about \u00a3140,000 pa.\nBut something must be on the cards; even a man with his credentials wouldn't merge two\nUniversities and introduce veritably reviled\ntop-up fees just for fun.\nSir Richard serves on several committees -most notably in this case the council for science and technology - and has a steering role\nin education policy. It comes as little surprise\nthat his paper 'pre-em pts' the government\nwhite paper in November, and Margaret\nHodge, higher education minister, has pointedly refused to rule out top-up fees when\nquestioned by the education committee. In the\ncurrent wave of 'neo-liberal' Thatcherism we\nare experiencing, it seems the government is\nkeen to divorce the Treasury from the co un try's universities and thus reduce public\nspending to cut taxes hence win votes.\nDrawing parallels to the rail industry, the government is attempting to privat is e an underfunded state service.\nSir Richard has a taste for running large\norganisations. UCL is currently in a weak pos i tion; the incumbent Provost, Sir Derek Roberts\nis only temporarily on the job, and the previous Provost Sir Christopher Llewellyn Smith\nwas booted out. Could Sir Richard be exploiting the situation to his personal advantage: an\naggressive merger with a rudder less University? As merger partners go, LSE would\nbe a much better choice for IC, but LSE have\nalready given us the proverbial finger. They\nknow that they have a strong brand, can\nattract the best students - and don't want to\nwaste money on an expensive merger.\nIt's well known that the favoured way of\nsaying \"thank you\" to a supportive un-elected\ncrony is to grant them a life peerage, or a seat\nin the House of Lords. The best thing is that\nSir Richard can choose to leave IC whenever\nhe wants. Merge with UCL, sell most of the\nbuildings to fill funding gaps, take the money\noff the students and then leave as Lord Sykes\nof South Kensington, and watch the student\nnumber/ability decline. Reminiscent of the\nrecent Glaxo share price movements, actually.\n7bm Tibbits\nYou could say that\na large group of\nindividuals is an\nimpossible concept;\nalternatively you\ncould work for one.\nTo learn more about opportunities\nat Marakon we would like to invite\nyou to our presentation\nMonday 28th October\n6.45pm Adelphi Room\nMeridien Waldorf Hotel, Aldwych\nNearest Tubes - Holbom, Temple\nFor more information\ncontact Emma Sorsky:\nuk recruiting@ mar akon. com\nwww.mar akon. com\nvia i a Koi i Associates\nstrategic management consultants\nChicago \u2022 London \u2022 New York \u2022 San Francisco \u2022 Singapore\nMB MH BB HB HH MBH SH HM felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX SPORT Grass! Plastic!\nGKT I529 IC I Having trekked across London to\nplay the mighty GKT, only to find\nthey had made the slight oversight\nof forgetting a referee, we had\ndoubts we would ever actually play\na rugby match this season.\nHowever, with the calm intervention of Brimah, our backs coach,\nthe game went ahead.\nThe game got to a \"cracking\"\nstart with an immense scrum being\nled by Chris \"You're not so lip py with your legs in the air\"\nProtherough, and soon enough,\nafter some slick forwards moves,\nthe backs were released by an outstanding kick by scrum half Rob to\nscore their first try.\nThen GKT came back, worrying-ly led by the ginger army to push IC\nback to their own try line. The\nImperial Defence, led by Alex\n\"shiner\" James rose to the challenge admirably and the half ended\nwith a blistering try by Dan \"Mr\nCasual\" Darg to put the score at\n12-0 to IC.\nIC began dominating the second\nhalf with monstrous tackles going\nin from Mike \"the Animal\" Hicks\nand Alex James to put GKT on the\nback foot. Further outstanding play\nfrom Chris \"Are you clean or do I need to go to the clinic\"\nProtherough again gave the backs\nthe space and opportunity they\nneeded to break through the\ndefence and set up Will \"the\nRaging Bull\" Nicklin with a try in\nthe corner. To state that Will enjoys\npicking on little wingers is as big an\nunderstatement as saying our sup-porter's hair was a little queer.\nBasically, Imperial rose to a huge challenge despite the obvious\ncheating on the scoreboard by the\nfurry ginger. Special mentions to\nDave Evans, whom scored a fresh-ers hat rick, Dan Darg and the\nindisputable man of the match\nChris Protherough. Watch out\nVirgins before it goes to his head.\nSome of us are too impatient to\nwait for snow to start racing, and\nso the first race of the year took\nplace last Saturday at Wycombe\nSummit.\nThe first two races for both\nteams proved that racing with no\npractice for 5 months is not a good idea, with both teams coming away empty handed.\nAn intermission in the racing\ngave both teams a chance to\nregroup. Ben and Ned headed\nstraight for the bar at this point -something about dutch courage\nand fear of pain - whilst the rest\nof us hit the slopes to try and prevent more embarrassment.\nBoth methods seemed to work,\nhowever, and IC1 and IC2 both\nracked up 2 deserved wins.\nConfidence was high and IC2\nstepped up to take a tough challenge against Southampton. All 5\nracers went down and IC2 celebrated a deserved victory - until\nthey were disqualified.\nDID VO U KNOUU ?\n-No matter, IC1 v IC2 was up\nnext, and more importantly Ned\nagainst Hideaki - last years race\ncaptain against the all conquering\nJapanese newcomer. Hideaki\nmatched Ned all of the way, and\nit would have been a photo finish\nbut Hideaki fell at the last and\ncrossed the line on his arse. The\nrest of the race was a formality,\nthe l sts recording a victory that\nwas so easy that the last racer\ncrossed the line backwards.\nIC clearly won the final race,\nbut it was given the other way.\nTime for Ned to have a tantrum -a pre-requisite of any race meeting - but throwing the toys out of\nthe pram had no effect and the\nteams finished 12th and 15th. Special mentions must go to\nKatie, who flew the flag for the\nimperial ladies in the absence of\nthe rest of her team, and to\nJames who came out of retirement to help with our lack of\nteam members.\n* Subway Restaurants is the u u or ld's largest submarine sandwich franchise,\nu ui th more than 17,000 locations in 72 countries.\n* Subway (uuo rl d uji de) gives 15% discount off normal s and u u ich prices\nto students everywhere.\n* Subuuay (203 Carls Court Road) gives 2 0 % discount off normal sandwich\nprices to Imperial College students RLL THROUGH TH\u20ac V6RR !.\n* Subway (203 Carls Court Road) is NOUJ OPCN FOR BRCRKFRST from\n07.30 a.m. weekdays.\nGRCRT VRLUC\nHCflLTHV, FRCSH FOOD FOR I.C.
