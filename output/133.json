Highly commended, for there can\nhave Lee:, few in the audiences that,\nhowever we l they knew the plot before,\nfailed to h.a.n used b the antics of the\nLord Chancellor, impressed by the s tri king entry f the years, and delighted by\nthe sin-in:; and dancing of the fairies. however, though usually dangerous\nto general is e, it is fair to say that as\na whole the diction throughout this production was good, but that the action\nand dialogue were too slow to keep the\nplot moving: thi3 does not refer to all the characters, ana may in part have\nbeen due to the inability of the orchestra to set a faster pace.\nHere is one of the .veal; links in an\namateur production: it is possible to\nbring the singers to a higher standard\nthan the orchestra for the ss ne amount\nof rehearsal time, and in the case of\nthe Society's performance of Mozart's Mass inC. Minor last term, this was\novercome by using a professional orchestra. The lead was taken by John Coleman\nas the Lord Chancellor: his performance\nwas well polished and did much to hold\nthe other actors together, though he\ntended to speak ret her than sing some of\nhis s ones. The title part was played oy Alexandra Mills, and while her sinking was\npleasant it was inaudible at times, and\nwas not accompanied by sufficient fairy li' action: surprisingly, the female\nlead .vas stolen by Daphne Gill as Phyllis^ the Ward in Chancery, for her beautifully\nclear singing was backed by ^or a e of the\nbest and most natural acting of the eve-ning.\nStrephon, 3u it or to Phyllis, was\nportrayed by Roger Atkins, and he was\nconvincing, with a very good voice,\nuntil he came to the spoken dialogue:,\nbut he .vas not alone in this, for\nTimothy Dhonau and Richard iV alms ley as\nthe two earl suitors to Phyllis had the\nsane failing. During their argument\noutside the no uses of Parliament, the\naction was sc slow that the alien ee became restless. Surely this fault could have easily beer e voided without\nloss clarity? SEE COLUMN THHJ*\nMY FIRST VISIT TO LONDON\nThere isr.o doubt that the first/ is it to London surprises most visitors, the reason being that London is so very\nlarge the most immense and widespread\ntown in the world, in fao ta world unto\nitself. I cannot begin to count how\na any hours I have spent in reaching;the\ninteresting spots, although I have been\nLiving in the centre.\nLondon, where the everyday crimes,\nburglaries, murders and thefts are as\ncom;ion as the dust-infected air. At\nthe beginning,. I was not merely v tru ok by reading, some \"LtaaauB* daily newspapers which-feed their readers with\nthese stories, but also by finding tha.\nthey formed the p. ist of the whole con-tents.\nJust one word about the air: never\nbefore could I have believed that such\na filthy air could pervade a town, and\nI am astonished that life is possible\nin it for 8 million people.\nTransport is another problem:\nactually, I consider the Underground well\nconstructed and organised, and the best\nmeans of travelling long distances in town in a short time.\nI met more foreigners in London\nthan English people themselves: I dare\nsay that London is a more exciting cosmopolitan town than you may find anywhere\nEverything goes the other way round, and\na Continental has to get accustomed to\nit all first. I would like to praise the car.\ndrivers' discipline which is ex cell*. and ought to be imitated by those on the\nContinent. They take much heed of ped-estr ian s, but many pedestrian-e gp fi ngs\nare very dangerous indeed and often cause\ntraffic jams. But why are.*i hf tren nt more subways to reach the opposite side?\nI have very much appreciated the .\nopportunities for entertainment offered\nby theatres and concerts, and also by\nthe large number of museums. Never\nshall I forget the many hours I have\nspent wandering around them.\nIn aid it ion,a thought about li ving accommodation. It is much easier\nto find suitable lodgings in London than\nin a Continental city: but the question\nof food is enough to upset most visitors' s to u a ohs because your form of nourish- 4\nment is so different. I am sure an\nEnglish person can more easily become\naccustomed to Continental food than the\ncontrary.\nFurthermore, I would like to s tre3: that a foreigner has great difficulty in getting in touch with English people.\n*ney are very cold and reserved.\nFinally, may I say that I enjoyed\nky stay in England very much, and that\nit was a very important and instructive\nperiod for me.

Irving and a slang ing match before a pack rd Union Meeting. Irving was d is missed from the Editorship of Phoenix\nearly last term, and shortly afterwards\nat a meeting of the U.L. U.W. U.S. Carnival Committee, which includes a member of the I.C.U. Council, he was\nappointed Editor of the Carnival Times,\nwhich was intended \u00bbs a rag magazine.\nAPARTHEID On Th-irs day24 th April, there a ppe a red a tI.C. proofs of the centre eight\npages of Carnival Times. These pages\nincluded an article supporting Apartheid, and der irK rg those members of the\nUniversity who protested against\nthe South African Universities Bill, with a car+o on in the same vein. The\nEditorial Stated that Britian had been\non the wrong side in the 1939 - 1945\nwar and subsequent campaigns, and\nclaimed that Hitler' s regime was \"the\nfirst great unifying force that Europe\nhas im own for six hundred years\".\nNEGRO CARTOON On the following Friday, Miss Hilda Browne General Secretary of W.U. S., was\ninformed of the imminent appearance of\nthese articles. She telephoned David,\nJaques, Chairman of the V.'. U.S. Carnival\nCommittee and was reassured by him that\nmatters were under control. Jaques,\nnevertheless, thought it necessary to telephone Irving, to inquire whether\nanything had been printed which Irving\nhad not shown him. Irving denied this and could not recall a cartoon concerning negroes.\njour days elapsed before Doug. Smith,\nEditor of Sennet, visited the printer and unearthed fifteen thousand copies\nof the centre eight pages. Only five days were left in which to alter, produce\nand distribute,the magazine. The reprinting considerably increased the oo\noost. It is hardly credible that someone should resort to such deceit, in order to em baras s and financially deprive\na charity like W.U. S. WHICH\nW.U. S. is a strictly nonpolitical ion-sectarian organisation; its sole\naim is the welfare of students.\nIrving's articles were both political and sectarian. If Published they would\ninevitably have caused great em baras s ment to W.U. S. It seems apparent that\nIrving knew this; why otherwise should\nhe attempt to conceal them?\nENTERTAINMENT ONLY At Irving's insistence Carnival\nTimes was printed on best quality news-print. This had to be specially manu-fact u red, considerably increasing the\ncost of the magazine. There is no\nshortage of witnesses to his declared\nintention to entertain rather r than make\na profit. Does Irving believe that\nprofits and entertainment are incompatible in a charity magazine? Whilst\nfinancial and political em baras s ment may\nnot have been his primary aims, he has\nachieved both.\nAnother issue raised by these events\nis that of responsibility. How could\nal member of I.C. Union Council with\nfresh memories of tendentious statements\nih Phoenix and friction on the Editorial Board, allow the U.L. U.W. U.S. Committee on which he sits to appoint Irving\nwithout insisting on adequate safeguards.\nWEEK? On FridV-' , April24 th. Jaques knew\nthat proofs of the articles were avail able, yet no visit to the printing wot rk was made until the following Tuesday.\nIn this time, the majority of the fifteen thousand copies were printed. A prompt\ninspection would have saved a considerable sum of money.\nHORROR A TU.C. On April30 th, PI the newspaper\nof University College - headlined this\n\"Neo-fascist Threat\" and commented\" it was not the ideas expressed that aroused\nthe horror and indignation of every-body, so much as the fact that a student\nshould abuse his position in this way\"\nPI understandably expresses horror\nand indignation at this abuse of privilege, but the ideologies that promote\nsuch abuse should not go un condemned. A CHALLENGE h.I. C. men attempted a round trip London to Land's End over the last week-end, leaving I. C.at6.45 on Friday\nevening. The successful pair returned\nto College by 2 o 'clock on Sunday after noon. The other pair, although they\nreturned to I.C. oy 8.30 Sunday morning,\nreached only Penzance.

Carnival Day is\nlasting a week.\nOur Own Private Procession\nDevotees of processions will have\nbee'' flight ed to learn that we are\nagain having our own private procession which will take pla oe this (Wednes-day) afternoon. The object is afa in to adv etti se the Carnival, and copies\nof the Carnival magazine will be sold.\nRepresentatives of the I. C.W. U.S. Committee were entertained to tea by\nScotland Yard last week; they were\nreleased after questioning and emerged\nwith permission for the procession to\ntravel via Queen's Gate, Kensington\nHigh Street, North End Road, Fulham\nBroadway, Fulheun Road, Brorapton Road,\nCromwell Road and back up Exhibition\nRoad to the Union.\nA good deal of enterprise has\ngone into making up this advertising\nn roo ee sion. In addition to banner*\n\u2022ede oke d student-type vehicles there\nwill be six Kingsway Oigarette vans\nfrom which free cigarettes will be\nhanded out.\nAlso taking part will-be\none stage coach as featured in the film\n\"Warlock* \u2014 this has been graciously\nlen f \"by~t lie Exploitation Manger of\n20th Century Pox. (Thinks: we're\na go-ahead College, why can't we have\nan Exploitation Manager?) Two or\nthree j az s bands will be accommodated\non separate lorries (they had better be\nseparate).\nClementine is unfortunately\nlaid up with gastroenteritis( i.e. boiler trouble), but Jexebel and Bo will complete the cavalcade, which will depart from Prince Consort Road at 1.30 pm,\nBspresso in i ju adr angul. Such components of the Union's corporate thirst as do not satisfy themselves in the Bar will doubtless be xx\nfinding gratification in the installa*tion in the quadrangle of a mechanism\nfor the creation, condensation and -sub-se que nt dispensation of student-type\nnectar; to wit, Espresso coffee. The\napparatus is housed in the largest open-air coffee shop under the sun \u2014 unless,\nof o our se, it rains. The aforesaid .'\ndispensation takes place at lunch-timo e and in the evenings. The coffee retail at 6d. per goblet and we are p revile ged to sup it at the delicate hands of a bevy of quite fair maidens of local educational affinity and closely vetted\ntalent, I'm glad to say. If you don't like mu sio there are jazz bands to provide an lan then tic Lyons Corner House\natmosphere.\nOther fund-raising activities currently proceeding are the Win-a Car raffle \u2014 I.C. has reportedly sold\nmore tickets than any other College \u2014\nand a Balloon Race. Added interest is being lent by exhibits and tableaux x r. from various overseas countries (cour-tes y of the Commonwealth Institute), and by the Photographic Competition.\nThe best W.U. S. week picture with the\nbest caption will earn a ticket for the\nMay Ball. SEE ADVERT FOR THE MAY BALL,\nPAGE5 Carnival Saturday will see the centre\nof attraction transferred to Bedford\nColl ego, which will be the starting and finishing point for a30 float\nprofession in which R.C.\"S. and Guilds\nand Mines will be represented. The\nthe ne of the procession is \"The Shape\nof Thing3 to Come\". Mysterious reports\nfiltering through the security screen\nindicate that, as we had long suspected\nthe Royal Col e ge of Science is nothing\nbut a Fiction. In addition to the resident attract\nions, the I.0. Coffee Bar will reopen\nin Regent's Park on Saturday and large\nnumbers of pilgrims are expected at th\nthis well-known shrine. I.C. representatives of the gentle gender will be taking part in a fashion show\nand the Jazz Band is forecast to take\npart in the finals of the Festival. The evening will be crowned by a Ball at St. Pancreas Town Hall. The\nblurb; says that the masks will be\nprovided. Richard Harnett looked as i if he was wearing his the other day\nbut he tells me it was just the rings\naround his eyes.\nHALDANE LIBRARY We are very pleased to a ear that\nthe new premises for the Haldane\nLibrary are ready at 13, Princes Gardens and will be opened by T. G.N. Haldane ~nF i. day, Kav 3th. After this date students themselves can\ninspect the decor, variously described\nas \"revolting\" and \" striking\". USE THE LIBRARY - IT IS YOURS J. "

LUDLAM.\nOG GIES GALORE THE RUGBY TOUR EI CORNWALL21 st26 th March.\nEveryone had a small wager on the\nGrand National on that fine Saturday as\nwe travelled to Cornwall. The excitement of the race was no more intense\nthan in the coach as we clustered round\nthe radio. It was an anti-climax as\nBregashti - the bookie announced that he\nheld the slip of the winner.- Oxo. The\nstops of course were frequent, but the\nmost memorable was at the Jamaica Inn\non Bodmin Moors where we had our first og gies. The fine weather of the fol lowing day encouraged the more energetic\nto explore the countryside around. x Thi3 paid dividends because everyone\nwas in fine drinking form that evening\nin the Penzance clubhouse.\nOur first match was played Monday\nevening against the local Penzance side,\nwhose winning run of five months had been\nended cn ly the previous week. Their\ngreater experience showed in the speed\nin which they changed the dire o tion of\nattack. I.C. were not disgraced in losing90. The game followed the\nsame general pattern; a Penzance attack\nwould be broken down in the three-quarters by good tackling and the ball would be dribbled back into the Penzance half, or kicked down the touch-line. The I.C. spirit never weakened\nand, near the end an I.C. if eK almost\nscored between the posts, being tao k led only a yard from the line. Everyone retired to the clubhouse afterwards\nwhere steaming og gies were served up and\ndevoured mercilessly. The beer flow ea freely yet not a glass was broken.\nOur manners were almost civilised. Playing und or floodlights on\nTuesday was a new experience for most\nof the team. The game, between two\nroughly even sides, was uninteresting.\nI.C. again lost, but the opinion of the\nreferee and that of both sides differed on Occasions. On a muddy pitch, and\nwith a heavy ball still tacky with the\nwhite paint, we were unable to score\nfrom the many penalties we were awarded.\nAn intense attack in the first half all but produced two tries for I.C., for they were stopped only by desperate\nstruggling on the goal-line. After a qu. st hour in the clubhouse with the\nlocals we returned to the hotel for beer and song. Bill the driver and\nBregashti the bookie took on our innkeeper and a local^sportsman at poker\na game in which the last two were\nreputed to be experts. The I.C. team\nwere two pounds the richer when the\ngame ended.\nHEAD OF RIVER RACE\nThe following afternoon we took\nthe coach to St. Ives for our last game. The scene of that early evening - blue sea, even bluer sky, the\nclearly defined coastline sweeping\naway in a wide arc northwards around\nCarbis Bay and below, the cottages of St. Ives set closely 'into the valley\nwhich ran down to the harbour - was an\nideal setting more for a picnic than\na game of rugby. The match was drawn\n6-6. each side serving a penalty goal\nand a try. I.C. led until nearly the\nend when St. Ives ware awarded a pena l ty on the 25. The game was always\nlively as both sides handled the ball whenever possible, even when I.C. lost their scrum half at half time. The\ninterest was heightened further by\nthe altercations between the noisy I.C. reserves and the red-faced Cornish\nsupporters who take a pride in their frankly aggressive attitude. The I.C. linesman was told that waving hi J flag was not its only U3e.\nThat evening was a fine climax to\nour tour, as we sang, and danced in a haze of og gies, sandwiches and beer.\nMost of the men in the room be o a me Zulu\nwarriors during the so i ree, while Mil ward turned out a four-star performance\nto become President of the\nUnion. When the bar closet, we went\nback to our hotel. The landlord was\nasked whether he minded our forming a scrum and knocking down one wall of the\nlounge. Though it was hard board he\nrefused and turned his Alsatians loose\nin the hall. A small party decided.to\ngo Alsatian hunting but we found that\nthis was merely an excuse in case a Police officer stopped them. The true\npurpose was revealed afterwards in the\nshape of two 'acquisitions'. Now,\neveryone who walks into the Union Office\nwill see that Land's End is only 9 miles\ndistant.\nThe spirit of the side strengthened\nfrom day to day, Our journey back to London was notably quiet, for the days\nhad passed too quickly. We had enjoyed ourselves without being a nuisance.\nIn each town.the supporters and teams\nwere impressed not only with our rugby\nbut also with the spirit and behaviour \u2022\nof everyone after tha game. A Penzance\nnewspaper testified to this when it re ported after Easter that our game had\nbeen one of the most enjoyable evening\nHatches they had played.\nNorman B. Greaves.\nTne slid in ct duo held i LAWN TENNIS The club has had 3 mato he s so far this term. The first one was an\nevening match against N. P.L. which Itas\nabandoned due to bad light. The 2nd team have since beaten Westminster\nHospital 7-1, with one game unfinished,\nind the 'A' team lost an exciting and\nvery even match against Calus College,\nCambridge, b66 games to 3.\nThe trials at the beginning of\nterm proved most encouraging and it is hoped that the club will have a more\nsuccessful season than in the past few\nyears.\nP.A. B. traditional Easter Course at Lasham\nduring the first week of the vacation.\nThe large attendance was amply rewarded with better weather than in the\nimmediately preceding years.\nOn the Wednesday and Thursday,\nconditions were good and several soaring\nflights were made. On the first of these days, Paul Minton flew his Skyl ark III and climbed in cloud to over\n10,000 feet, to complete the height\ntest for the 'Gold C Certificate. He\nthu3 be q or aes the first member of the\nImperial College Gliding Club to obtain\n\u2022the 'Gold C* Certificate. Meanwhile,\nPrank Irving had been sitting in a meeting in London, gazing out of the\nwindow at the clouds. He arrived at\nLasham to hear that Paul had beaten\nhim to the 'Gold C. Prank flew |he\nSkylark TU the next day but it was\nnot a he:ig ht day, and he had to be\nfe on tent with some local soaring at\n2,500 to3,000 feet.\nDuring the same period, David\nTomlin and Vemon Nicholas flew the\ntest for the ir'C Certificates in the\nOlympia and several other members dew this type for the first time.\nThroughout the week, training was\ncarried out in the two-seaters.\n\"Phoenix\", our Skylark II, was\nbrought back from the Midland Gliding Club where it had spent the winter,\nand two days work were required before\nthe ravages of the d aim? winter had been\nmade good.

    "content": "FELIX? CYCLING TOUR A party of cyclists from I.C. together with 2 recruits from U.C. and one from Birmingham, spent nine\ndays together cycling in the south\nwest.\nWe met at Exeter Youth Hostel\nand on the first day journeyed to Minehead, by way of Tiverton and Tarr\nsteps. The morning being spent in some interesting lanes between Exeter\nand Tiverton, and the afternoon in negotiating some un surfaced roads to Tarr Steps.\nOn the second days run to Ins-cow\na rash bet about the possibility of riding up Porlock Hill resulted in one\nmember of the party being exhausted\nfor the rest of the day, and a round of\ncider, at the close of the tour, from\nthe l03er. The afternoons route lay along a disused road that clung to the\nedge of the cliffs near Parraocnbe,\npar ovid ing excellent views of the cost.\nThe following day was marred by\na broken back axle in the a rly after noon, after visits to Westward HoJ and\nClo vally. The rest of the proposed\nit i nery had to be cancelled, and after\na Makeshift repair we had a hurried\nride to Otterham Youth Hostel, to arrive\njust in time for supper.\nThe fishing village of Boseastle\nwas approached on the following morning through the 'Valence' valley, a sore\npoint with the chemists amongst us.\nThe headland there is pierced by a natural tunnel, and heavy seas were\nspouting through, most of the party\ngetting wet in an endeavour to get\ncloser to the tunnel mouth.\nThe hostel at Treyamon is magnificently situated on the edge of the cliffs, and as the morning was bright and\nclear it was some time before we dragged\nourselves away to visit Pedrouthan\nSteps, Newquay, Truro and the beautiful church of St. Just in Roseland before\ncontinuing to Boswinger hostel.\nThe popular coastal resorts of Mevagissey, Fowey, Polperro and Looe\nwere visited on the next day, and al though at the height of the';holiday season traffic wa3 surprisingly light. One of our friends from U.C. was unfortunate in snapping a saddle pillar just before reaching the hostel at Lostwithiel, but with the help of a Guildsman it was successfully patched\nup i ri~e morning, prior to a run direct\nto Plymouth, where we were entertained\nin th homes of two of our friends from\nI.C. The last day saw us venture up to Princetown, where a storm of driving\nsleet made us all resolve to be good\nstudents. The rest of the day was\nfine, and we had a ple.sant ride to Dartmeet bridge, Buokfast Abbey and\nBrent to arrive at Bigbury on Sea host el just before dusk. After3 upper we\nfound the nearest hostelry along some\nnarrow paths to a neighbouring village; it was here that the round of cider was\nprovided by the loser of the earlier bet. The pubs name was of course \"The\nJourneys End Inn\", which we thought\nmost fitting. J. B.R. GUILDS MEN IN PARIS The morning of Saturday, 21 st\nMarch saw 36 impatient Guildsinen\nwaiting for the \"of;1\n\" to Paris.\nEnthusiasm was high, too high for one who in his haste got a \u00a34 speeding\nticket. The college subsidy was given\nout; thanks to the generosity of Profs.\nSaunders, Squire, TustLn, Skempton and\nDanckwerts. Saturday evening found\nOuildsmen in Pigalle, Montmartre, jazz\nclubs and other unusual places on the\nleft bank. Sunday was grey and hazy\nboth from the point of view of the\nweather and our heads.\nA week of visits followed, the\nhighlights of which wan that to C.N. I.T. a large exhibition hall in the shape of a leaf that only touches the ground at\nthree points, whose amazing construction\n\u00bbas explained to us by the Chief Engineer\nThe sorting department of the\nFrench Railways, from whom British Railways could learn a lot, impressed\nthe party by its efficiency in carrying\nout its very complicated task. At the\nHydraulics Ijab. M. Laurent, an old friend of Professor White, provided an\ninteresting tour round models of ports\nand rivers. A visit to the Renault\nfactory nearly depleted the party's numbers as the roads there are used as\na test racing track.\nThe return.trip was somewhat of a nightmare, an overdose of wines and\npleasure combined with the lack of sleep, and a bumpy passage was quite\nsickening.\nJ.E. Nove\nIC CONTRACT BRIDGE CLUB A Bridge Congress was held under\nthe auspices of the club on Saturday\nand Sunday, March 14th and 15thin Ayrton Hall. Imperial College acquitted themselves well, coming a very close second\nto Oxford Univer it yin the Invitation event, and win d ng the open event by a very wide margin.\nTwo pairs from I.C. also won in the\nevent for a pris.M. R.K, CROSSCOUNTRY Last term ended with three victor ies, with the first team beating Southampton and winning the West Ham 8 m. road race, and the second team beating\na on don Hospital.\nWe expected a hard match against\nSouthampton, as we had only beaten\nthem by 5 seconds in the Hyde Park\nRelay. From the start Sliiiming\n(S 'ton) took the lead, followed by a bunch comprising Tilly, Jaeger, and two\nSouthampton men, with Barber and Briggs\nnot far behind them. Slimming went\non to win by more than a minute from\nM. Barber (l.C.) who had o aught and\n\u2022\"assed the bunch ahead of him. CP. Tilly ran well to take 4th plaice, then\ncame J. Jaeger ( 6 ) , D. Briggs (8),\nP. Warren (9), D. Sandoz ( lid. Counting six men, the scores w re equal,\n78 - 78, but I.C. won the match\nbecause our 6th man was ahead of te Southampton 6th man.\nThe West Ham 8 resulted in an\neasy win for I.C.(15 pts.) with Reading\nUniversity 2nd(30 pts.) and Peterhouse, Cambridge, 3rd. The individual winner was J. Heywood of Reading,\nfollowed by P. Carmichael of Morpeth. H., and J. H. Collins (I.C.). The ot n er*I.C. runners were Briggs ( 5 ) , Barber\n(7), Brown ( 9 ) , Bernard (12), Cleator\n(l6) and Sandoz (23).\nThe I.C. second team, defeated\nLondon Hospital, for the third time\ntl is season, by 21 pts. to34. Imperial College men occupied the first three positions, with R. Cheeney 1st,0. Huntley 2nd, and M. Clare 3rd. The\nother I.C. scoring men were C. Jame3\n(6th) and D. Fearn (9th). The \"Petersham Pot\", awarded\nannually to our keenest and most consistent runner, this year went to J. Bernard (Chara.Eng. I).
