    "content": "Felix 909 25 July 1991\nAlan Vega\nDeuce Avenue. Edward Scissorhands\nThe scene is American suburbia\nwhere freedom of expression is\nshown by choosing which pastel\ncolour to paint your house. The\ntime is present irrelevant, but\nsomething is very different. Within\nview of this sickeningly idyllic\nhousing estate is an improbably\nhigh 'Dracula' craggy mountain\nwith matching 'Dracula' craggy\ncastle (painted in a tasteful shade of\npastel black). Nobody in the pastel\nhouses seems to notice this\naberration in normality due to the\nfact that this is no everyday story;\nit is a fairy tale.\nIn the craggy castle lives a creation, a modern day Frankenstein's monster; a half-finished model of a man with a leather body and scissors for his\nfingers. He is Edward (Johnny\nDepp), a model of a man who is\nhuman on the inside, but externally,\nhe is a parody of human form,\ncomic in his looks.\nEdward receives his first\nexperience of society, when he is\ntaken home and cleaned up by a very motherly Avon lady, Peg\n(Dianne Wiest). The stereotypical\nAmericans are amused by him, and\naccept him into their society, much\nas they would a video recorder if\nit landed on their doorstep. They are\nproud of showing him off, letting\nhim cut their hair, clip their dogs\nand hedges, but few actually get to\nknow him. Fame spreads and soon\nhe looks as if he may even fit into society.\nHe meets Peg's daughter, Kim( Winona Ryder) and falls in love.\nShe on the other hand accepts him\nas a person and figures out that he\nis a far nicer guy than her current\nboyfriend. OK, so she falls in love\ntoo but doesn't know it. It happens\nin films all the time.\nSounds simple, doesn't it? Life's never like that. After several\nmis demean ours and misunderstandings later he is being\nshunned by the gaggle of neighbours, and wanted by the\npolice. Kim suddenly realises that\nshe loves him after all and life in\ngeneral gets rather difficult for all\nconcerned.\nTim Burton's direction (Batman,\nBeetlejuice) is superb. Keeping in\nthe same vein as Batman, Edward\nScissorhands is a 'large' film which\nis designed for and works excel lend y on the big screen. Plenty\nof wide panning shots and moody\nlighting are present to keep film\nbuffs happy and set the atmosphere\nof the film. The pacing of the film\nis perfect, a very comic superficial\nbeginning and first half which\ndeepens and darkens as the film\nprogresses, ending in a moody and\nserious ending.\nJohn Depp gave an superlative\nperformance as Edward with firm\nbacking from the rest of the cast.\nWinona Ryder was as competent as\nher role would allow, but her\ncharacter was written as being far\ntoo stereotypical to do anything\noutstanding. Nevertheless her\nacting would leave any gerbil\ndrooling over his whiskers.\nWhat more can I say? A beautifully written, beautifully\nacted, beautifully made,\nwonderfully funny and deeply\nmoving film. As I left the review\ncinema I was choking back the\ntears. Then again, I'm a gullible\nromantic. Romance is contagious;\ncatch it.\nMurph.\nIn a week when my grasp of reality\nwas de cri bed as 'tenuous', it is\nfitting that I should get around to\nreviewing this album. Y 'see, lunacy\nis a well-worn trick used mainly by\navant-garde freaks, following long\nbouts of going without sleep and\ntaking copious amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals; result\nbeing, they get lost in the virtually\nlimitless void of self-contemplation\nand pretence.\nAlan Vega, Stooge-inspired\nelectro rocker and half of Suicide,\ndoes not fit in with the above\ndescription. This particular freak is\nun attractively twisted. So unattractive in fact, that his\nappearance onstage has had the\ntendency to spark off vicious,\nhorrific audience reactions (bottles,\nspit and lit cigarettes are the most\ncommon form of greeting for this\nman). The nearest thing this man\nhas known to a normal move was\n:\nThe film that reaches the parts other\nfilms cannot reach\u2014Robin Hood\nhas everything: humour, adventure,\nromance, suspense, murder and any\nother characteristic you'd like to\nname. Kevin Costner gives an all\ntoo convincing performance of\nRobin\u2014once rich boy now poor\nman.\nAlan Rickman (the evil German\nfrom Die Hard) makes a very\nmalicious Sheriff of Nottingham.\nL.P. joining Andrew Eldritch'sM ish kicking spin-off, The Sisterhood.\nAll this, presumably, is provoking interest in the record,\nbecause I haven't said anything\nabout it yet, and it was released last\nyear. 'Deuce Avenue' releases an\namphetamine-fuelled psychosis\n( M.M. standard phrase No. 13); as\na portrait of Vega, one could\nimagine Elvis Presley as visualise d by Francis Bacon. A grotesque\nrockabilly fiend slashing the facade\nof control over a razor ed, monstrously minimal backing.\nWhere 'Body Bop Jive' is tense and\nunnerving, the title track is\nunequivocally deranged. This is\nabout as close to the edge as is\npossible - either that or we've both\ngone overkill. N.B. to the\ncollective ' YOU',' YOU' won't like it.\nSonic Euph\nThe star-studded cast includes Brian\nBlessed, Chris Slater (Young\nGuns), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Abyss) and a famous unmentionable playing King\nRichard (guesses on a postcard\nplease!). The scenery is amazing,\nfilmed on location in France and\nEngland and succeeds in wrapping\nyou in the mystery surrounding the\nlegend of Robin of the Hood.\nSam.\nRobin Hood - Prince of Theives\n\u2014 2 \u2014\n\n"

We\nhave a design consultant in to help\nus with our choice - at no cost to\nthe Union, College or ourselves. I sincerely hope that the newspaper\nthat emerges is more professional\nlooking and easier on the eye. The\nreasons for a change of name are\nvarious - 'Felix' is not a name that\nimmediately conjures up an image\nof a responsible and intelligent\nnewspaper, it is often confusing to\npeople from outside the college, it\nis an old and somewhat jaded joke\nbased on the occasional college\nmagazine 'Phoenix', it is, in a word, a puerile name.\nThere are good reasons for\nkeeping it - the main one being that\nthe name 'Felix' has a reputation in\nthe college. I hope more arguments\nfor and against will be debated in\nthe future -1 don't want this change\nto be seen as the mad fantasy of a megalomaniac editor, but because\nthere is a need to change.\nAnother possible modification\nconcerns the status of the Print Unit\nin relation to Felix. Any attempt to\nmake this a retail outlet is fraught\nwith complications - mainly due to\nthe state of mental health of the\nEditor and the independence of the\nnewspaper.

ISSN 1040-0711.\nEditor i a Boring Mines\nDear FELIX,\nI feel that I must write to you in\norder to put the record straight after\nyour publication of Anna Teeman's article British Coal Challenge Ban\nin the Felix Summer Special. As a recently graduated student of the\nMining Engineering course at\nImperial (whose fourth year major\nproject was an open cast coal site in\nthe heart of a suburban area), I feel\nthat I speak from a position of some\nstrength on this matter. A number\nof points should, I feel, be made\nabout the article.\n1. Far from being 'economic\nstupidity', the operations run by the\nOpencast Executive of British Coal\nare some of the cheapest mines in\nEurope, only being undercut in\nprice by, for example, the large\nlignite mines in Germany.\n2. 'In addition, low sulphur coal\nmust be imported into the country,\nat cost, for proper mixing'. Much\nof the coal produced by British Coal\nOpencast is used as 'sweetener',\nadded to improve the quality of the\ncoal produced by the underground\nmines so beloved of Ms Teeman.\n3. The implication is made that\nF.O.I.L. would appreciate the site\nto be mined using underground\nmethods. Three points are raised\nhere:\na) Underground mining may\nemploy more men than .open casting, but is far more expensive than\nopen cast and can, in the shallow\ndeposits that would be considered\nfor open casting, produce extreme\nsurface subsidence.\nb) Longwall underground mining\nis only applicable efficiently to\ndeposits with certain characteristics,\nsuch as a large horizontal extent,\nand a relatively continuous ore body topography. The costs involved in\nestablishing such an operation are\nconsiderable, and the production\ncosts under the wrong conditions\nastronomical.\nc) Having not long been granted\nfreedom from labour agreements\nthat meant that British Coal had to\nmaintain uneconomic production,\nthey would rather not open a pit of\nany description than be forced into\nproducing coal at a loss.\n4. 'The British Coal planning\napplication...contains only vague\nassurances that no detrimental\nenvironmental impact will result'.\nNo open cast mine in this country\nwill be given planning permission\nwithout strict limits being placed on\nnoise, dust, blasting vibration,\nvisual impact and increased road\ntraffic, and can be shut down by\ngovernment inspectors if these are\nnot adhered to.\n5. All coal sites, of whatever\ndesign, produced quantities of dust.\nWhile I cannot comment on\nindividual cases, it is certainly bad\npractice to allow a site to shed\ndeleterious quantities of dust, and\nthis can be prevented by the use of\nsimple water bowser s to lay the\ndust.\n6. If two children were killed by\nlorries from a site where all of the\ncoal was being moved by rail, I would infer that these lorries were\ninvolved in carrying supplies to the\nsite. Should the site be mined using\nunderground methods, the\nquantities of supplies required\nwould be vastly increased, as these\nsites require, inter alia, face and\nroadway supports, ventilation\nequipment and heavy items of plant\nsuch as face shearers that are not\nused in open casting. In all affluent countries, as wealth\nincreases, there is a decreased level\nof understanding as to the source of\nthat wealth, and Ms Teeman seems\nto be a prime example of this\nWhy has the Union ignored\npostgraduates this year? As\nmembers of the student body the\npost grads deserve more from the\nUnion.\nTo collect your ideas and find out how the Union can aid post grads and provide the events and help that\nis needed there will be a series of\ndepartmental-based meetings.\nThese will be held either in your\ndepartments, providing easier\naccess, or in the Union Building to\nobservation. Employing more\npeople for the sake of increased\nlocal employment, to the point\nwhere economic realities are simply\nignored, is exactly the sort of\ncentrally planned communist\nstupidity from which Eastern\nEurope is struggling to free itself.\nBritish Coal is an efficient, low cost\nproducer, and extracts coal under\nstricter environmental controls than\nalmost any operator in the world.\nWould Ms Teeman like to see the\nentire, not inconsiderable,\nworkforce of British Coal Opencast\nand its contractors forced out of\nwork, rather than letting some\npeople be quite close to a heavily\nshielded hole in the ground for a while?\nYours sincerely,\nDave Healy, M Eng.\nshow the facilities available.\nNotifications will be posted in\nyour departments. We hope that\nthese meetings will enable us to\nprogress to larger interdepartmental gatherings.\nIf you have any ideas regarding\nthe services you need from the\nUnion, then come to the meetings,\nwhich will be advertised soon.\nSteve Farrant,\nHonorary Secretary (Events)\nExt 3503\nPostgraduate\nPreliminaries\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"

Pairs of bulls\npulling a plough would race other\npairs across the dry and infertile\nfields.\nToday the bulls race in a specially\nprepared arena and more than just\nhonour is at stake; for the victor is\na promised fortune in stud fees, a lucrative prize anywhere in the\nworld.\nThe finest bullocks, with well\ndocumented pedigrees, are reared\nsolely for racing.

By mid morning the\nstadium is nearly full, children run\nI am looking at the level of support\nand structure provided by the Union\nfor postgraduate students (PGs) at\nImperial.\nMembers of Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) elect a PostGraduate\nAffairs Officer ( PGA O) who\nrepresents PG son several\ncommittees including Union Council, Union Academic Affairs\nCommittee and the College Graduate Studies Committee.\nThe PGA O also chairs the\nPostgraduate Group Committee,\nwhich is a meeting representing\nregistered PGs (research assistants,\nPhD and Msc students). The brief\naround clasping plastic bags\ncontaining iced drinks of the most\nvivid colours, old men stand in\ngroups renewing old acquaintances\nsmoking the aromatic clove\ncigarettes so characteristic of Indonesia.\nThe entertainment begins with a parade of the bulls, shaded by\nparasols and bedecked in gilded\nyokes.

At present\nthere is no PGA O and without this\npost filled there can be no\nPostgraduate Group Committee.\nThe loss of opportunity for the PGs\nat IC includes the reduction of interdepartmental communication on a student level, the overlooking or\nignoring of PG problems and the\naround the stadium. The larger\nstuds accompany their champions\nwith a band of cymbal is ts, pipers,\ndrummers and gong players, their\nmelodic music adding to an already\ntense atmosphere. Before racing\ncommences the finery is stripped\noff, the tempo stepped up and the\npairs of bulls goaded into anger by\nwhips and branches. The jockey,\nsmall even by Indonesian standards,\nis lifted onto the sled which hangs\nbetween the pair. He sits in a near\ntrance, in each hand a small wooden\nblock with nails, a very primitive\nsteering wheel when one considers\nthat the next 150m will be covered\nfar faster than a chemically assisted\nBen Johnson ever could.\nA hush descends upon the crowd,\nthe music reaches a higher fever\npitch and the trainers strain to hold\nback their bulls. A hefty slug of\narak, the infamous rice brandy, is\nadministered to the bulls, and they\nare ready.\nThe flag drops and the crowd\nroars. Muscles rippling, the bulls\nsurge down the track, the jockey\nbobbing up and down alarmingly as\nhe desperately tries to keep a straight path. Within seconds it is\nall over, 30m past the line is a wall\nand the jockeys frantically reign in\ntheir pairs which veer left and right\ninto the seething crowd. They duck\nand run to avoid the bulls, yelling\nwith joy as the pairs hurtle into their\nmidst.

Disembarking\nfrom the Prospector here would\nallow three days before the next\nIndia-Pacific train which would\nwhisk me across the Great Victorian\nDesert to the old y world y oasis of\nAdelaide and the next leg of the\njourney.\nIt is a little over 2,700 km\nbetween Perth in Western Australia\nand Adelaide in South Australia,\nalmost the same as the distance\nfrom London to Moscow. Most of\nthis distance is comprised of the\nNullarbor (meaning treeless) Plain.\nToday's base maps of this\ntopographic vacuum show three\nstraight lines. The key denotes each\nas; a road, a railroad and a telegraph line.\nThe lonely Eyre Highway takes\nits name from John Eyre, the trailblazer who made the first east-west\ncrossing in 1841. That journey took\nfive months and resulted in the\ndeath of Eyre's companion John\nBaxter. In 1877 the telegraph line\nwas laid along a route that the\nhighway was later to follow. Later\nthat century the prospectors bound\nfor the gold fields of WA followed\nthe telegraph line. In 1896 the first\nbicycle crossing was made and in\n1912 the first car was driven across.\nOnly three more cars managed the\ntrip in the next twelve years.\nIn 1941 the war inspired the'\nbuilding of a trans-continental\nhighway, which remained\nun surfaced until 1976. The highway\nfollows a southerly route close to\nthe sheer coastline and makes\ntoday's Nullarbor crossing much\neasier. Despite this, petrol stations\nare up to 200km apart, and help\nfrom other traffic scarce.\nThe Trans-Australian Railway\nruns 150km north of the highway\nand tr an sects the 260,000 square\nFinishing my contract two weeks\nearly I planned to use my new found\ntime to travel overland from Perth\nto Sydney and my flight home. I had ten days to complete the\n3,961km and hoped for a better rate\nof progress than John Eyre had\nachieved 147 years before!\nEveryone I spoke to about the\nNullarbor gave advice on how to\ncope with the boredom and\nmonotony of the empty wastes.\n'Count the 30 metre spaced\ntelegraph poles and work out the\nspeed of the train'. None had ever\ndesert state, and no indication of\nthings to come. A surface water\npipeline accompanies the train to\nKalgoorlie, the white streak\nducking and diving, swerving and\nbobbing beside the moving train.\nThe intricate, green topography\ncreated by the Swan River\ndisappeared to the south as we\ninched our way into the barren gold\ncountry. The water pipe persisted\nto scurry along close by. Although\nsparsely populated, this stretch of\ntrack was positively teeming with\nlife compared with the desolation I dared to make the journey by train\nthemselves. They preferred to take\nthe highway around the edges of the\nhostile void, or to deny its vastness,\nskipping over it by plane in a matter\nof hours. For a 'Person of Mother\nEngland' such as myself, it was the\nonly way to experience the alien\ndimensions of this island continent.\nwas to experience once on the\nNullabor. The elderly gentleman\nbeside me had made the journey on\nthe India-Pacific train in the early\nsixties. He assured me that nothing\nhad changed in twenty-five years.\nIt was easy to believe; there was\nlittle that could have changed! Why\nwas he undertaking the monotony\n_ 4 _ 2 5 July 1991 Felix 909 Feature\nof such a trip again? The Nullabor\nplain is surely a place you only\nattempt to cross overland once in a lifetime. Had it really taken twenty-five years to recover from his first\ntrip?\nSix hundred kilometres and eight\nhours later, without warning,\nKalgoorlie was suddenly upon me.\nNo suburbs or outskirts to herald its\narrival and only a skyline of mine\nain\nshaft head gear to suggest its\npurpose.\nMy three days in the gold country\nranged from a trip one thousand\nmetres underground with geologists\nfrom the Mount Charlotte mine, to\na stroll down Hay Street, past rows\nof bright red corre gated cabins; the\nprefabricated brothels of\nKalgoorlie's red light district.\nThe India-Pacific pulled out of\ntown at 6.00am, sixty hours after\nthe Prospector had arrived. The\nbulging brown uniform of an\noverweight conductor bustled\nthrough the carriage welcoming us\nto 'his' train and warning of the\nconsequences of wasting the\nprecious water. 'We all want the\ntoilets to still flush in Adelaide' he\njoked.\nThe old mining town sunk into\nthe desert as abruptly as it had\nemerged. My elderly friend from\nthe Prospector was in the same\ncarriage, still ty ring to recall if\nanything had changed. There was\nnow even less on which to gauge\nany change, with only thirteen\nsettlements in the next 2,000km. My immediate companions for the\nnext thirty hours were three\nblondes, Dee, 4, Bo, 6, and their\nmother Susan. Less than one hour\ninto the journey Bo could wait no\nlonger and challenged me to a game\nof cards\u2014'UNO'. It was sometime\nsince I'd last played, but I quickly\nrecalled the rules and managed not\nto be beaten. The final score of\nforty nil impressed only me and it\nwas several days later I realised that\nperhaps I should have tried a little\nharder to lose!\nBy the time we reached\nParkstone, Kalgoorlie's trees had\ndisappeared to be replaced by\nsalt bush, blue bush and des sica ted acacia trees. These gave way to\nshort brown grass which was finally\nbeaten into submission by the\nscorched broken rock of the\nlimestone plateau. Humidity did not\nexist. I could only marvel at the\ncourage and stupidity of John Eyre\nand John Baxter for attempting such\na crossing alone on foot.\nThe Nullarbor is not an\nundulating sand dune desert like\nthose of North Africa. It is rocky\nand flat, inhabited only by\nkangaroos, rabbits and the odd\ncamel. Even the Aborigines avoid\nit, their reserves scattered round its\nperimeter. The snooker table\ntopography rivalled the flatness of\nthe Cambridgeshire fens. The\ndeeply dissected dykes of the\nfenland fields seemed Himalayan in\ncomparison.\nOccasionally we sped through\nsmall camps of waving men,\nwomen and children, past in an\ninstant. They appeared to live for\neach train and it seemed a crime not\nto stop. All we could do was return\nthe wave.\nThe first stop came at 9.30am in\nthe withering metropolis of\nZanthus, a land of loners. At only\n200km from Kalgoorlie we were\nstill within dirt road commuting\ndistance for shopping in the gold\ntown. We all spilled off the train\nand onto the ground, one metre\nbelow, awe struck by the\nremoteness and the lack of buildings\nwhich barely formed one street.\nOur freedom was short lived and\nten minutes later we were torn away\nfrom THE shop and herded back\nonto the wagons.\nLunchtime didn't arrive soon\nenough. Something new to do. I shared a packet of biscuits with Bo\nand Dee and returned to the thesis.\nThe next three hundred\nkilometres bought two more\nanonymous supply stops. The train\nstuck out of each cluster of cabins\nlike an arrow through an apple. The\nisolated a gro phobia of each\nhabitation was hard to fully\ncomprehend. Such isolation bred\nhad begun.\nTelegraph road came round twice\nmore before Dee, Bo and Susan\ndecided to turn in. The double seats\nspun round full circle and the table\ndismantled to be incorporated into\nclaustrophobia, the surrounding\nhostility of the desert imprisoning\nand confining each conurbation.\nThe day 'click e ty clacked' on and\nthe tedium of the train's limited\nvocabulary started to wear. The\nUNO, the thesis and conversation\nhad been superceded by the\nwalkman. 'Telegraph Road' started\nplaying and I resorted to counting\nthem, recalling the advice of my\nwell wishers. I calculated the train\nwas doing a de moral ising50 mph. I wished I hadn't bothered.\nBoth Western Australia and the\nsun were rapidly disappearing. The\ntelegraph poles became silhouetted\nagainst an eerie outback sunset, the\nonly trees in a treeless plain. We\ninched into South Australia and a black, blank night. My staring\nreflection now dominated the\nwindow and I was pleased to draw\nthe curtains, banishing it outside.\nTime to eat again. I munched my\nway through some more bread,\ncheese and apples, pondering the\npredictability of my provisions.\nIn the dark an hour later we\nreached Cook, the halfway mark\nand a major refuelling station. A large marigold moon glowed low in\na blue-black canvas of sky and\ndesert, illuminating the floating\ncanopy of corre gated roofs.\nThree hours down the track I suddenly felt a new sensation.\nEveryone in the carriage had\nadopted the synchronise d swaying\nso familiar to the London\nUnderground. We had just\nnegotiated a bend, the first since\nlunch 498km ago! The longest\nstraight piece of railway track in the\nworld was past before I realised it\nthe 'bed'. Forgetting that deserts get\ncold at night I hadn't bothered to\nretrieve my sleeping bag. I regretted\nthis for the next eight hours as I lay\nshivering on my cusio n of biscuit\ncrumbs, covered only by a denim\njacket.\nBy 6.00am(4.30a mW A time) I could bear it no longer and rose to\nuse some of the precious water,\nwashing my hair in the compact\nshower room. Suffering from\nunbalanced travellers diet I was\nthankful that the toilet still flushed!\nThe new day brought new\nterrain. The Nullarbor had past with\nthe night and the damp morning air\nand the abundance of trees were\nmost welcome. We clattered into\nPort Augusta at 8.30am and stopped\nfor ten minutes to stretch our legs-.\nWith only 380km left we were now\ntravelling almost directly south. On\nthe right horizon were the fertile\nFlinders Ranges; to the left the\ndazzling reflectance of the Spencer\nGulf in the hot, bright 9.00am sun.\nI finished my bread and fruit for\nbreakfast in the hope that we would\narrive by lunch time.\nAdelaide bought mixed feelings;\nrelief of arrival yet sadness at the\ndisbanding of my travelling\ncompanions. I was sorry to part\nwith Dee and Bo. The camaraderie\nestablished in the carriage was\ndismantled only too quickly as the\n'expedition' members disembarked\nto go their separate ways. The\nsatisfaction of enduring the\nun punctuated tedium of the 200km 'Tea and Sugar' run was unique.\nFor now though, the order of the\nday was to 'do' Adelaide before my\ntrain for Melbourne departed.\n\u2014 5 \u2014\n\n"

A possible solution to the problem is\nentry into the government funded\nBusiness Expansion Scheme or\nBES. The scheme is a method by\nwhich educational establishments\nraise funds from the private sector\nto buy student accommodation.\nIndividuals are allowed to invest\nup to \u00a340,000 with a tax free return\non their investment after five years.\nDividends would be solely derived\nfrom rent paid by the students in\nresidence.\nImperial would not be the first to\nenter such a scheme. The insurance\ncompany 'SunLife' has set up\ncompanies under the BES aegis at\nLancaster, Sussex and York\nUniversities, each of which now\nhold funds of up to \u00a35,000,000.\nDespite the apparent advantages of\nthe scheme, there are considerable\nproblems in its implementation.\nAccording to Malcolm Aldridge,\ncontroller of IC's financial services,\none sticking point is that students\nwould have to be issued with\n'assured short hold tenancy'\nagreements, which under the 1988\nHousing Act give tenants rights that\nare so extensive as to make them\ndifficult to dislodge at the end of the\nstudent year.\nMr Aldridge said that there had\nbeen no test cases evicting students\nfrom college accommodation.\nThere is the possibility that students\nwould be tempted to stay in assured\ntenancies instead of attempting to\nfind accommodation outside the\ncollege.\nHRH Princess Anne, the chancellor\nof the University of London, visited\nthe college on the 10th July to open\nthe new centre for' Biomedical\nsystems and the centre for Toxic\nWaste management. The Rector,\nSir Eric Ash, said that the new\ncentres were the 'physical\nembodiment of the merger' of St\nMary's and IC.\nThe centre for Biomedical\nsystems was funded by the Sir Leon\nFresh Start\nBagrit foundation and will be named\nafter him. Lady Stella Bagrit, his\nwidow, explained that he was a humanitarian with 'a passionate\ninterest in science', and that he\nwould have appreciated the help\ngiven to future scientists.\nProfessor Bryan Coles, former\nPro-Rector of IC, told Felix that\nboth centres will be starting MSc\ncourses in September.\nImperial's Careers Advisory\nService (CAS) has a new director.\nJohn Simpson, formerly a recruitment manager for ICI,\nofficially takes up his post on 1st August. He takes over from Russ\nClarke whose services were\nwithdrawn when the college\ndecided to leave the University of\nLondon CAS.\nBen Turner, future ex-Deputy\nPresident of the Union said that he\nwas 'very confident in his (Mr\nSimpson's) abilities'.\nLaughable\nLoan\nLevels\nThe Department for Education and\nScience, the DES, has issued\nfigures for the student loan rates for\nthe academic year 1991-1992.\nFor students living away from\nhome in London, the maximum\nloan will be \u00a3660 for a normal year\nbut only \u00a3480 if the student is in the\nfinal year. For students living at\nhome, these figures are \u00a3460 and\n\u00a3335 respectively.\nThe maintenance grant for the\nacademic year 1991-1992, for\nmandatory award holders in the\nUK, is frozen at the same rate as\nfor last year. For London students\nliving away from home it stands at\n\u00a32,845 and for students living at\nhome, \u00a31,795 for the year.\nThe 'top up' loans level for the\npast academic year, 1990-1991,\nwere \u00a3460 for a full year and \u00a3340\nfor a final year student living away\nfrom home in London, and \u00a3330\nand \u00a3240 respectively for a student\nliving at home.\nIn addition the DES has released\nfigures concerning postgraduate\naward rates. Bursaries for London\npostgraduates will be \u00a32950, or\n\u00a31760 if living in the parental\nhome. Studentships will be \u00a34970\nin London and \u00a32915 for those still\nat home.\nBuses\nThe bus route 33, which used to end\nin Prince Consort road, now\nterminates at Hammersmith and\nalternative bus routes from there are\nthe numbers 9, (stops at the Albert\nHall) 10 and 27 (Kensington High\nstreet).\n\n"

The only thing known\nabout him is that he is a 'nice' man. Anna Teeman unearths this man's past in the hope of\nfinding something. Or indeed anything.\nMr John Major, the man who is\nnow the Prime Minister of Great\nBritain, is also the man who failed\nto become a bus conductor with\nLondon Transport.\nHow did this happen, how did the\nman rejected by London Transport\nbecome the Prime Minister, or\nrather how did the man who became\nPrime Minister fail to become a bus\nconductor?\nMany years ago in the time of the\nsixties, three people spent a nerve-w racking day in the recruiting\noffice above Wandsworth garage\ntrying to become bus conductors.\nThere was a tall 17 year-old, a West\nIndian Woman and a third mystery\nfigure. Each was given a ticket\nmachine to play with and an\narithmetic test. The West Indian\nwoman was the best of the bunch\nand was so thrilled to get the job,\nshe danced.\nThe tall, lanky 17 year-old\nwalked away from Wandsworth\ngarage and wandered far and wide\nto find himself, not long after in\nfront of the door with the figure 10\non it. So he thought 'Why not?',\nstraightened his tie, knocked on the\ndoor and walked in.\nThe lanky lad, though his contact\nwas brief, was not forgotten. Many\nyears later his trials with the ticket\nmachine and arithmetic test were\nfondly recalled. This whisper of\nmemory so long held grew louder\nto a steady rumble until men and\nwomen proclaimed from the\nrooftops 'I 've driven with a man,\nwho worked with a woman, who\nsold a ticket to the man who taught\nthe woman who beat John\nMajor...to sell tickets!'.\nJohn Major, hearing this cry,\neven though the thick walls of\nnumber 10 Downing Street, scuttled\nup onto w nat was now his roof and\ncried T was too tall, honestly!'.\nThis produced a roar of delight\nfrom those who caught the drift of\nhis cry on the winds that blow to the\nfar off borough of Wandsworth.\nEach and everyone turned to each\nother and said 'That's funny, that's really funny'\u2014they laughed so\nmuch they almost fell off the\nrooftops\u2014and one or two of them\nactually did. 'But why this hilarity?'\nasked a woman of a fallen reveller\nin the street below.\n'He failed the arithmetic test,\nluv.'\n'Oh goody' said the woman.\nMr. Major- man, minion or machine?\nWHO IS\nJOHN MAJOR?\n'Oh no' said John M. 'Impossible' said the polite man\nfrom the buses, 'because he was the\nChancellor.'\n'Exactly' said the cynic.\nThen suddenly everyone stopped\nand once again turned to one\nanother but this time said with one\nvoice 'I'm confused'. Then they\nstood silent, looking exactly that.\nAll except a West Indian bus\nconduct res s who danced more\ngleefully than on the day she got her\nfirst job.\nIn the almost perfect stillness one\nquiet voice could be heard distant\nyet clear. 'Show me the great book\nwhere 'tis all writ down'. Then the\nsilence, no longer content with itself\nbecame embarrassed.\n'Ah hem', said an apologetic\nvoice.\n'Not possible.'\nWe lost many of our records in\n1980 when London Transport was\nsplit up into smaller companies, and\nthus began this tale of woe:\nAt the dawn of Eighties Age a blue dragon roamed throughout the\nland, the fearsome creature, known\nto one and all as 'Mad Maggie the\nMoney Monster' breathed fire so\nhot it was white tinged with blue.\nThe fire consumed all in its path,\neven parching the water itself, and\nonly the scorched plain of\nprivatisation remained. From its\nlair, deep in Whitehall Castle, the\nFire Monster satiated its thirst with\njuicy red buses as they lingered\ntant ali singly beyond the castle\ngates. And the great book where it\nis all writ down? Lost forever in the\nblue fire from which only a tattered\nphoenix rose, fragmented, yet\nmiraculously able to open wide its\nwings if only to cough at its first\nflap. The apologetic voice faltered\nand became weepy.\nThe Fire Monster, deep in its\nDulwich lair, licked its lips\u2014once\nburning but now long cooled\u2014and\nlet out a tiny puff of smoke, a signal. Now the fledgling monster\npeers through Whitehall windows\nand over rooftops crammed with\nwatchful silent figures and glimpses\na single cloud, rising. The message\nis ' All is safe, none will ever\nknow'. The new monster, now\nmiraculously mature, licks lips fast\nwarming.\n'How convenient' it breathes and\nsteams up all the windows, then\nturns its back and lights its fire.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

The companies are\ncommitted, by European edict, to\nreducing sulphur dioxide emissions\nand must set-off burning high\nsulphur with low sulphur coal. Such\ncoal is scarce in Britain and its\nforced import, says Mr Cox, has\ncontributed to the current trade\ndeficit.\nBritish Coal's contracts with\npower companies, due to expire in\nSumit Paul-Choudhury (a.k.a.

A In common with many other\ncommunities similarly threatened,\nit is the loss of their countryside that\nconcerns protestors in\nLeicestershire the most. During the\nproposed eight year working period\na vast acreage of land would be\nswallowed by the extraction\nprocess.\nCommunities who have been\ninvolved with British Coal for a long time have little faith in either\nits ability or commitment to keep\npollution levels down. Residents\nliving next to a current site in\nLeicestershire, but a stone's throw\nfrom the proposed site, suffered\ndramatic increases in both noise and\ndust when mining started.

Following Ray Proctor's assertion that 'We can extend\nanything indefinitely', assurances of\nspeedy reclamation ring hollow.\nOpencasting is no longer\nwelcome in Britain's mining\ncommunities. Deep mines\nemploying whole villages have been\nreplaced by shallow pits employing\nfew local people. The closure of\ndeep mines was followed by a desperate drive to attract new\nindustry of long term benefit to\nmining areas. The environmental\nimpact of open cast sites, argue\nprotestors, actively discourages\nsuch investment. Objectors in\nLeicestershire claim that the\nprospect of continued open cast activity has already dampened\ninterest in the area and precipitated\na fall in house prices.\nLeft in limbo by British Coal's plan, residents are impatient for the\nAugust appeal. They are also\npainfully aware that, under current\nguidelines, ministers have allowed\nopen casting on almost sixty percent\nof the land on which local\nauthorities initially refused\npermission.\nThe privatisation of British Coal\nwould lie high on the agenda of a future Conservative administration;\nopen c sting is British Coal's most\nprofitable activity. Pressure groups\nfear that even if the appeal is turned\ndown the project might still be\ngiven the governmental green light\nand the environment would be\nsacrificed for short-term, shortsighted financial gain.\nMichael Heseltine might soon find\nhimself in the eye of a storm now\nbrewing in Leicestershire. British\nCoal is battling fierce local\nopposition against plans for a new\nopen cast coal mine. The final\nshowdown is set for August when\nan independent inspector will hear\nan appeal following the proposal's rejection at local level.\nThe inspector is not empowered\nto make a final ruling but to send\na recommendation to the\nEnvironment Minister, Michael\nHeseltine, with whom the final\ndecision rests. Mr Heseltine is\nunder no obligation to comply with\nthe appeal's findings.\nwith government guidelines on\nmineral extraction. The guidelines\nstate: 'because open cast coal mining\nis one of the cheapest forms of\nenergy available to this country it\nis in the national interest to\nmaximise production where that can\nbe done in an environmentally\nacceptable way'.\nIn today's climate of changing\nenergy demands the true worth of\nopen cast coal is no longer so\ncertain. Protestors in Leicestershire\nhope to scuttle mining proposals\nwith a dual economic and\nenvironment broadside.\nBritish Coal claim that their low-cost open cast operations are\nBritish Coal has been singularly uniquely profitable and fund a not afterwards.\n1993, are 'protectionist', say\nprotestors, because they prevent\ncompanies from buying coal on the\ninternational market. Ray Proctor,\nchairman of British Coal's open cast wing, says he is 'confident of\nretaining a considerable proportion\nof the contracts'. Pressure groups\nremain unconvinced.\nIn the light of such damning\neconomic evidence, claim\nobjectors, the environmental\ndamage wrought by open cast mining appears indefensible.
