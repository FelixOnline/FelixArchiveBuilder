    "content": "Editorial The Refectory. The recent further increase in the prices of all refectory meals has caused great indignation throughout the\nCollege. Students trying to live on less than a labourer's wage are bound to take grave exception to any increase in their cost of living, particularly when that increase is brought\nabout by an organisation that is part of the College. Two years ago lunch in the Union cost1/6 d. and the\nrefectory showed a considerable I03S - of the order, we\nunderstand., of \u00a33,000 in a year. An efficiency expert(s oid is a iet) was therefore called in, who promptly raised prices all round. In view of the staggering loss, however, this was\naccepted by the students as inevitable, and it was hoped that he would then increase efficiency so that ends might meet. He\nintroduced tickets, bought new cutlery, removed some animals\nheads from the walls, moved the tables around, and left but\nthe refectory still shows a loss. In the public bar of an ordinary London pub lunch costs l/9d, and there are many restaurants that serve lunches for2/ and less. These are commercial establishments that have\nto pay for rent, lighting, heating, periodic re decoration and refurnishing, and pay a dividend on the money Invested in them. These are all items that do not appear on the refectory balance sheet, and yet our prices are higher, and the food\ncertainly no better. Why? In a pamphlet which, has just been circulated we\nare told that the reasons are:\"(a) that the refectory runs at a loss in vacations, and (b) the profits on many meals ( all, apparently, except\nlunch) are too low to contribute towards overheads and running expenses. The Committee have therefore decided that the deficits hall be met partly by reorganisation and partly by increased prices, We feel that the College13 almost unanimous In believing with us that the whole deficit could be met by\nreorganisation. Is It necessary, for instance, to employ a number of male chefs when women cooks command a lower salary? Is there no room for staff reductions? How many staff do we\npay to keep in( presumably) comparative idleness in the\nvacations, and why? These 'are typical of the questions s tude'nt s are as king. When one draws the comparison with outside restaurants, and remembers that Queenie, with, her smaller and., more efficient organisation, was showing a profit at the old prices, it is almost impossible not to draw the conclusion that there is gross inefficiency in the refectory. The time has come when\nthe Union should demand a complete and ruthless reorganisation, and perhaps a new Committee to see that it is done.\nTheft In the College. There have recently been a large number of thefts from the Colleges and the Union, particularly from the r changing room, cloak-room and Hostel. We trust that Council will take whatsoever steps may be necessary to stop the\ntrouble, but in the meantime, take heed of this warning: it is not safe at any time to leave valuables unattended in the\nCollege, and Hostel rooms should never be left unlocked. It is a thoroughly un savoury situation, but it must\nbe recognised. "

Even now, three days after the event, there appears in my minds eye, like some nightmare horror, a picture of the First Eight passing the Boathouses at Putney. Much\nwater will pass under many bridges and much strong language\nthrough many megaphones before that awful sight can be\nerased. What was it a coach once said to a crew? \" Sitting In a boat like eight sacks of........,...\" No, that does not nearly express my feelings. Starting No.10 behind the New College Oxford, the first eight,( no, I refuse to give them capitals), made a moderately good start and by Barnes Bridge had caught up New College and were overlapping their rudder. So far so good, and much\naccording to expectations then things began to go wrong.\nA tail wind after Barnes knocked the crew off their feet and\nlosing their heads at the same time they began to drop behind New College. Thereafter the details become too disheartening to relate. Suffice it to say that no amount of Coaching and\nhelp from Coach or Cox made any difference. The crew were\nneither listening north in king. How did the other nine I.C. crews fare? No amount of\ngood rowing In the lower boats can excuse the disgrace of\nhaving fe he; first eight finishing28 th. Yes,TWENTY EIGHTH,\nThe Fourth Eight rowed well as their final position shows and, with the exception of Thames III, beat the third eights of every other Club. A good effort indeed, but one\nwhich is completely overshadowed by the shocking bad effort of the first eight. What now? Let it be set down in print, that unless the crew that goes to Henley realises that they are up against real fanatics at their own sport, they might as well not enter. The College crews at Henley will have been rowing in real ernest every day. No nonsense about nights of fat the pictures, or at dances, or evenings out with the girlfriend, but an intense effort waking, sleeping, breathing and\ntalk in growing. Any Tideway Club if it hopes to compete on\nanything like equal terms must have the same tenacity of\npurpose and live to row and to row hard every day, from April to July. Nothing else is nearly good enough. It is attitude of mind that wins races, attitude of mind and plenty of honest hard work and concentration during training. Wake up I. C.B.C, You cannot expect to live in the reflected glory of traditions handed on to you by others. It Is up to you to work hard to maintain those traditions and to strain every nerve in an effort to hand on to those who will follow you, a Club of which they can be justly proud.\nFinal Placings.

    "content": "- 5 -I.C. MEN SAIL ON \"DISCOVERY II\" The R.R.S. Discovery ll sailed from London recently on a two\nyear expedition to the Indian Ocean, South Pacific and Antarctica. Among the research team aboard are two I.C. men, Roland Cox\nand John Hooper, both chemists from Chem. Tech. The expedition is sponsored by the National Institute of Oceanography, under\nthe Admiralty, and is the sixth of a series of voyages\noriginally planned by the Falkland Islands Survey between the\nwars. The object of the present expedition is to complete the\nocean o graph lc work undertaken before the war and will include the study of whales and other marine creatures, movements of\nwater, sea temperatures and the mapping of the ocean bed.\nI asked Cox how he came to be involved in the exp edit io nan unusual type of job for a chemist, He said that he had\napplied quite innocently to the Civil Service Commissioners\nfor a quiet little research niche for himself. The first question at his Interview was: \"Would you go on a research ship to the Antarctic?\" Regarding this as a trick question and\nw racking his brains for a' different' answer he found himself saying 'yes.' A week later he was astonished to get an\ninvitation from the Admiralty to consider joining the\n\" Discovery II.\" Many men will envy him this opportunity to combine research with globe trotting. However, it is work\nunder exacting conditions( e.g. how does one use a balance on\nboard ship?); also there will be plenty of routine work:\nanalysis of sea-water, sediment from the ocean bed, some\nbotanical work; and remember - he has no professor he can\nconsult I The leader of the expedition is Dr. Herdman, a physicist; others of the team include two biologists, a photographer, meteorologist, and a doctor. Cox and Hooper have the grand\nde sign a11 on of \"Hy dr elo gist s,11 Fremantle, W, Australia will be the base port. From\nthere the 'Discovery II' will voyage into the Southern Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, re victualling periodically at\nother ports.

    "content": "- 3 -Profile: Maurice Denham.\n'Dudley Davenport at your service,S ir!'Well, Mr. Denham did not use quite these words when I 'phoned him hut he gallantly consented to be 'done1 for FELIX. Though Mr. Denham has no\nconnection with the College, we believe that Dudley has a number of close cousins within our walls, I found Maurice Denham pullover ed and gum booted in his garden. Nobody could be less like the immature youth Dudley,\nnor yet another of his characters. Mr. Blake, the sexton. With his stocky build and measured tones, the pipe smoking\nMaurice Denham may be pictured somewhere between the two -which description, if not precise, is at least not pedantic. He told me he had always had a hankering after the stage; did amateur dramatics whilst an apprentice with Waygood-Otis,\nbut got more lift out of life when he joined the Hull Repertory Company, After this and work with other reps, he got his first West End part in'1937. He wrote to the B.B..C. for an'\naudition got one a year later! and did a number of\nbroadcasts in Childrens Hour, Band Wagon and. various plays. In 1939 he went away with the B.B.C, Variety Company and\nplayed in the first25 ITMA'S with the late Tommy Handley.\nThis was followed by the Army - he served with the Buffs in France and Germany till1945, In1947 he joined up with Murdoch and Home's AirForce, then newly de mobbed into the famous club at Much Binding, Dudley Davenport soon won a place among the permanent staff along with the improbable\nSamuel Costa, He offered me-a cigarette and rel it his pipe, I asked\nhow theatre audiences compared with alive mike. \"No two\naudiences are a like,\" he said: \"emphasis and timing often require changing according to the ' feel' of the audience. But in broadcasting one must try to 'sense' the unseen audience\na more difficult matter,\" As to microphone nerves he confessed that he suffered!\" it gets worse and worse. As time goes on,\npeople expect more of you and you expect more of yourself. But a mistake In alive broadcast is often funnier than the\noriginal lines.\" Maurice Denham is married, has two boys and a baby girl. He has no ambition to reach for the stars; he is content with his family and his garden. With his whimsical air and\nquiet calm manner he seems to have found a workable recipe for life, \"Let us cultivate our gardens\" said Voltaire, Maurice Denham does just that. fur annual inter college sports this year are to be held at Mot3pur Park on May 1 7 th, that Is on next Wednesday week.\nLast year this function was rather poorly attended, but\nit is traditionally one of \u2022 the great social occasions of \u2022 the College year. It is the time when, not only the members of the\nColleges turn out to cheer and encourage their athletes, but\nso also do their wives, girlfriends and parents as well as\nthe sisters, cousins and. aunts. It is the occasion when the\ns umm or worries of exams and unfinished course work are cast aside, and the College enjoys itself. Let us hope, then, that this year the stands may be\npacked, the sun shine, and our own College win. TECHNICAL ITCH? Extract from a letter toR. Swain, Secretary of\nU.L.

    "content": "- 2 -ON BEING EXCHANGED (Continued.) .\nIn the first part of this account of American university life I said that this continuation would include some remarks\nabout the examination system and the social and residential life of M.I.T., but first I must not forget to mention a rather striking comparison in what I can best describe as a student' allegiance. In England a student is primarily loyal to his college, and a usually friendly and healthy rivalry exists between Individual colleges; in America the allegiance is decidedly and strongly associated with the student's own\nparticular year. Those who are now Seniors and who finish their undergraduate careers this summer are k nov/ n as 'the\nclass of 1950'; today!s Fresher s are already known as 'the\nclass of 1953' and such a date of graduation becomes as much\napart of a student's name as are his Initials. Each such\nclass elects, for each of its four years at College, its own\npresident, and. on graduation a permanent President and\nSecretary whose job it is to maintain the class spirit of\ntheir year for the rest of their lives. Each class organises when the time arrives elaborate five year, ten year, twenty-five year, etc., reunion week-ends and vie with the other classes In making large gifts( usually financial) to the\nCollege. The graduated classes as a whole make up the College's Alumni Association and in the case of many Colleges their Alumni Association seems to wield considerable power in the\nrunning of the College; this seems to me to be a most\nundesirable state of affairs but it is almost traditionally accepted. While I am touching on financial aspects It might\nbe of interest to mention that the total tuition fees for an\nordinary four year course may be over \u00a31000.\nThe four years of a normal course are divided into eight sixteen week terms, during each of which about five subjects have to be taken. About every three weeks, at his discretion, the instructor teaching a subject holds a one hour ' quiz' a somewhat informal but unseen examination. A student thus\nmust s it for an average of about two quizzes each, week. The\nquiz papers are marked and count roughly fifty fifty with a three hour final examination in the subject at the end of\nthe term. On this basis the student gets awarded a 'grade'\n(percentage mark) for each subject as he takes It. A progressive cumulative of all his grades is kept( if it ever falls below a prescribed minimum he bids a reluctant farewell to the College) and his eventual degree is distinguished not\nby a class but by a final average grade. The quiz system Is\na masterly device which ensures continuous cramming with the\nmaximum encouragement to forget each portion of each subject as rapidly as possible. Considerable residential accommodation is provided in the College; it also, perhaps unintentionally, fosters student\nstratification in the irrespective years, with Dormitories mostly for Fresher s and Sophomores, a Senior House for Seniors, and a Graduate House for postgraduates. Quite a large percentage also live in fraternity houses; these are not\nowned by the College but are large houses in the neighbourhood\nwhich form each the local affiliation of the corresponding fraternity organisation, most of which I believe are nationwide. New members are elected by invitation from the Fresher s during the week before their first term (they arrive early to be given what must be a very rapid once over). Once elected a student lives in his fraternity house for his College career, Apart fr on the fact that they tend to encourage a certain withdrawal of their members fro ci full College affairs these\nfraternity houses seem to be entirely successful from a social point of view. They organise social activities to a noticeably greater extent than was evident in the College itself there has been discussion whether or not, from the College point of view, they are satisfactory; the answer may be that with such\nlarge numbers some breaking up of the population into smaller components is inevitable.

    "content": "- 0 -MANDRAGOLA.\nWhen it was announced in the last issue of Felix that Machiavelli1 s play \"Mandragola\" had been described as having a plot\" sufficiently scandalous to account for its having been suppressed In most countries,\" ticket sales for the Dramatic Societ'y Easter production soared.\" This,\" people\nthought, \" is going to be good.\" The event, unfortunately, did not live up to these expectations. This was not due to Inadequacy in the cast or production; they wore both up to the standard usually set by the Dram.\nSec. Christopher McKoen as the Monk, in particular, played his part with relish and humour, and Joyce Churchman as the heroine gave a much better performance than her part in \"Much\nAdo\" might have led one to expect. The fault lay in the choice of the play, and in this the Dram. So c.are not to be congratulated. It would seem that they are, this year, frightened of comment from the audience\nruining a straight production; at Christmas their \"Much Ado\"\nwas a great success be cao. se Shakespeare's comedies were written with a view to participation from the pit, the audience had\nin many cases studied their part beforehand, and the whole\nperformance was carried through with wit and good humour.\nWith \"Mandragola\" it seems that the Dram. Soc. tried to stifle comment b;y choosing a play so bawdy that little comment could be passed without being crude. This and the fact that the \u2022\nplay was not a good one left the audience yawning like hens\nwith the gapes.\nBy all means let us occasionally have productions in which the audience may take part, but let us also have plays that are enjoyable for their own sake.\nThe hew Phoenix.\nThere seems to be general agreement that the new bird,\nis more sprightly by far than it's recent predecessors. It is presented with imagination, clarity and a good use of the\nalways limited material available. Successive copies of our\nmagazine have suffered in the past from not being sufficiently \"pur\" magazine; it has seemed that a collection of peculiar highbrows have striven to display their erudition with no\nparticular regard for the readers' enjoyment. At last may it be said that \"Phoenix\" produces readable articles which, while being of a good literary standard, are not so\nconfounded ly boring as to cause the reader to do no more\nthan scan the pages. Two major criticisms come readily to mind: Goethe's bicentenary was flogged to death by the B.B.C. and the press some time ago; the fine resources of the Photographic Society could, surely be more effectively used\nthan by printing4 photographs by one artist of similar subjects. We have genius in our photographic midst; let it be displayed in Fhoenix. I hope for more \"Phoenix's\" of\neven brighter plumage, to reflect even better the artistic aspirations of ourselves. For this one, I would say \" Well done Mr. de Reuck, may you have even more success!\" D. C.H. Competition. Entries are invited for the completion of a short poem whose first line is; \"There was a maiden so demure\"\nEntries which would lower In any way the high moral tone of\nthis publication will be reserved for the amusement of the Editorial Bawd.\n\n"
