    "content": "Dear Mark\nSo we have among our\nnumber in this college, people\nwho subscribe to the creationist view. The thing which struck me forcibly about both\nattacks on my article from Mr j Mercer and the Islamic Society was their lack of\nprecision. Apart from saying\nor implying that they are\nagainst my views, or what\nthey took to be my views, they\nwere not very clear about\ntheir thoughts on the subject.\nMr Mercer took a distinctly\nselective and dubious interpretation of Genesis I.I have,\nof course, pondered on the\norder of creation given in Gen\nI:126 being the same as that\ndetermined by evolutionary\ntheory; however I have also\npondered on Gen II: 4-24\n\u2022 which deals with the same\nmaterial but gives a different\norder.\nAnd quite how the Islamic\nSociety can say that 1400\nyears ago the basis of modern\nscience was revealed leaves\nme (almost) speechless. If this\nhad been the case then surely\nthere would have been no\nneed to have spent the vast\neffort on the Scientific Enterprise that has been exerted.\nMuch as it is nice to say that\nyou were right with hindsight,\nalthough the interpretations\nof the Koran verses quoted\ndid seem slightly far-fetched\nto me, it is simply ancestor\nworship to claim this. That is\nin some way our ancestors\nwere better, or knew more,\nthan we are or do.\nBoth Mr Mercer and the\nIslamic Society state some of\nthe things that they are\nagainst, but omit a great deal\nand fail to say what they are\nfor. For example does Mr Mercer think that man is an\nanimal or not? Do Mr Mercer\nand the Islamic Society consider a materialistic account of evolution is sufficient or do they want to add to\nit, propose another ex plan a tion, or not believe in the idea\nof evolution at all? Neither\nsaid anything about what\nthey thought about creation-ism. What sort of people are\nthese who attack a coherent\nexplanation of the development of life and yet have\nnothing to say about what\nthey think of the problem.\nUnlike what Mr Mercer thinks I have no desire to\nforcibly suppress creationism,\nsince the very in articulateness of people like him is sufficient\nto condemn it; I merely reserve the right to point out\nwhat these people are saying.\nMr Mercer also said that I had accused creationists of\n' meg lo mania'( a word incidentally that I did not use;\ndo I detect a trace of para-noi a?). He did not refute my\ncharge that creationists were\nseeking to impose a belief\nsystem on society so that they\ncould control society. This is\nobviously Mr Mercer endeavour ing to suppress the\ntruth about the motives of the\ncreationists, which is quite\napparent to anyone who has\nhad the misfortune to read\nany of their literature.\nFinally Mr Mercer stated\nthat Darwin was a Christian.\nIn his youth he was, but after\nthe publication of his Origin of\nSpecies in 1859 he was hounded\nfrom the church by people as\nintolerant as Mr Mercer appears to be today. Truth is\nmore important than dogma,\na lesson which Mr Mercer\nand the Islamic Society have\nyet to learn.\nTours sincerely\nFrank James\nDear Sir\nI read with interest the\narticle that you published in\nthe FELIX supplement last\nweek by the Islamic Society\nand would be grateful if they\nwould return the complement\nby reading this letter.\nI am a Christian and would\nalso like to think of myself as a scientist. I took biochemistry\nas a first degree and found\nthat, far from conflicting with\nmy religious beliefs, it in creased my awareness of the\nmarvellous intricacies and\ncomplexities of life to such an\nextent that I find it hard to\nunderstand those who do not\nbelieve in a creator. These\nbeliefs can only be reinforced\nwhen one considers the vastness of the observable universe\nwhen compared to the insignificant, though all important\nto us, speck of dust that is the\nearth.\nI am an ardent believer in\nDarwinism and do not find it\nconflicts at all with my belief\nin God. It is impossible to\ndemonstrate the existance of\nGod by a scientific method. A quick look in Genesis 2 (where\nthe creation is given in a different order to the famous\nstory in Genesis 1) quickly\ndispels the argument that the\nBible is right because the\ncreation story follows the\norder of biological evolution.\nIt must be understood that\nwhether or not this is the case\nis completely irrelevant to\ntrue religion and only serves\nto draw attention away from\nthe true focus\u2014God himself.\nSimilarly I would be most\nsurprised if a truly devout\nMuslim found it necessary to\nmanipulate the sayings of\nMuh a med to try to demonstrate his awareness of modern\nscientific discoveries.\nIn conclusion I would like\nto say that true science whose\nideal is pursuit of the truth\ncan only serve to increase\nman's awareness of his God and his incredible feebleness\nand in sign fic ance in the face\nof the vastness and variety of\nthat which we know as crea-tion.\nTours, etc.,\nAndrew Lyall\nDear Mark\nThose people in College\nwho remember Bernie Smith\nwill doubtless be delighted to\nknow that the one time Physics Dep Rep and current\nSurrey University sabbatical\nmega-hack is now the Tory\ncandidate for NUS Vice President Education, a sort of\nnational A AO. Chris Webb\nDear Sir\nWe would like to thank IC\nBoat Club for the red-hot\n\"boat burning party last\nSaturday.\nWe are sorry our boat\ncouldn't make it.\n1 ou is extinguishing ly Chief Fire Officer and all the\nlads at Putney\n.S 'ir\nThe College members of\nthe 22 Club regret that MrS. J. Marshall finds it necessary\nto put his name to a badly\nwritten collection of lies and\nmisinformed opinion, as\nappeared in the soapbox article in FELIX602. The\nreason for our regret is not\nthat we hold Mr Marshall in\nany esteem whatsoever, but\nthat he is an associate of the\nRoyal College of Science, a title proudly borne by the\nmajority of our members. We\ndo not wish to correct the\nl acts here nor to continue\nthis debate through the pages\nof FELIX. We will simply\nstate that any member of the\nCollege wishing to know the\ntruth about our behaviour or\nthe spirit of our club has only\nto ask a club member.\nWe remain your obedient servants\nThe College members of the\n22 Club Ed's Note: See Editorial.\nDear Sir\nAn opportunity is arising to\nship many tonnes of medical,\nfood, and other essential\nsupplies by boat and land\nfrom IC to Poland. Estimated\ndate of departure is March21 with Easter spent in Poland or\nCzechoslovakia.\nFor this private and totally\ncharitable venture to succeed\nwe need a reliable conscientious and nonpolitical IC crew to: organise supplies;\ncrew the vehicles; assist in\ndistribution; return without\npolitical or media propaganda. The cargo will be fully\nmanifested, and the crew must have valid visas in British passports. We hope the\ntrip will be fun, but there will\nbe some speedy hard graft at\ntimes. Since the reception will\nbe mixed we hope to take a mixed crew.\nIf you can offer any help\nplease contact Colin Cooper\nin DoC2.\nPage 2 FELIX, January 29, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "\u00a7 Rugby\nThirds\nIn this first match of 1982 nine players made\ntheir debut e for the Thirds. From the warm up a strong team spirit was established and\nwas evident throughout the match, easily\nmaking up for the disadvantage of being a player short\u2014he was ref-ing. From the kickoff it was clear that the smaller, lighter IC pack of only seven men was going to have a hard job winning clear possession and defending against a large UCL team. Two superb tries, involving much passing gave ICa half-time lead of 15-6, having c once ede d two penalties.\nThroughout the second half the superior\nweight and numbers of UCL forwards began\nto take effect. IC won very little possession\nand spent much of the time defending hard.\nDespite this, a fine try was run from within\nour own 22 involving the entire team in a brilliant display of passing and support for a touch down under the posts. ICc once ede d two tries in the dying minutes of the match.\nA fine team performance throughout a fast\nclean exhausting game was topped by\npinpoint goal kicking by M. Hudson.\nTeam: J. Cougton, C. Dobson, M. Hudson (1\ntry, 4 conversions, 1 pen ally), M. Patterson. C. Boyd-Moss, P. Hughes-.Narborough (1 try), J. Taylor, A. Marks, M. Shepherd, E. Handford, J. Poullney, J. Mulligan (2 tries), P. Overs, J.. Vorley, S. Kirby.\nBadminton\nFirsts\nThis time the match venue was warm, dry\nand had lots of refreshments (Jaffa cakes!).\nFlow ever, the opposition was not much changed from the last meeting though their\npairing had changed and we, without our\ntwo England Youth stars, still produced a handsome 8-1 victory. Wing and Ball had a difficult time with their first pair but won in\nthree sets. However, there was no trouble\nfrom their first pair against Lee and Adamson who squashed them 15-0, 15-10.\nUnfortunately, our third pair were beaten by\ntheir first pair.\nOverall, it looks as if we are well on our\nway to winning the mens F'irst Division for\nthe second time in four years! (F 'ull athletic\ncolours for all the first team!)\nTeam: H.K. Wing, I. Ball, T. Lae, G. Adamson. S. Chiany and L. Tup.\n^ Hockey\nFirsts\nThis was our first game for a couple of\nmonths because of the weather. (It's been\nsnowing a bit!!) So, despite a distinct lack of\nmatch practice and fitness, added to an\nappalling pitch, IC played a surprisingly\nreasonable game of hockey. Ashford's pre-match over-confidence due to their superior\nleague position was soon thwarted by a good\nteam display by IC. Ashlord's goal came in the first hall after J. Clarke, whilst in possession of the ball, tried\nto be too casual when confronted with about\nhalf the opposition. From this slight set-back,\nIC increased their pleasure but had to wait\nuntil mid-way through the second half for A. Garms to score a well-deserved goal after a dazzling solo run.\nGarms scored a winner with only a few\nminutes to spare, but their umpire disallowed\nthe goal because he was biased.\nAlthough we weren't playing at Harlin g ton, our goalkeeper, R. Slatter, was still able\nto keep himself amused, in between his usual\ndisplay of aerobatics, by watching trains and\nthe odd jet.\nIn the changing rooms, his only comment\non the match was: \" I couldn't quite read the\nlettering on the Lufthansa 727 that flew\npast.\"\nAll the team played well, etc., etc.\nTeam: Slatter, Clarke (Capt), Parker (match\nreport writer), Franklin, Riley, Bell, Ayers, Rao,\nFarmer, Garms, Bateson.\nSeconds\nRemembering last term's league match in\nwhich the quality of umpiring decisions was\nmatched only by the total lack of sportsmanship in the Ashford team, we approached this\ngame with some relish. Ashford, obviously\ndelighted with the prospect of their umpire\nrunning the whole game, allowed us to play\nwith eleven men, a move they regretted from\nthe start. Inside the first five minutes Mangat\nBansal and Andy Stroomer combined down\nthe right, a bye-line cross providing the first\ngoal from Mangat. After two similar attacks\nwe went two-nil ahead, Tim Mitchell doing\nhis best to miss from close range but finally-forcing the ball home. Just before half-time\nan incident occured which would bring tears\nto the eyes of any cricketer who has ever\nforgotten his box! Fortunately, the victim\nwas an Ashford player, although sympathetic\nwinces would be seen on both sides!\nIn the second half, down to ten men and\ntiring we had to cope with strong Ashford pre s sure. The defence was bolstered by Jeremy\nRhodes in his comeback game after five\nyears away from the sport. Needless to say, he\nlooked perfectly at home in the team and\ntogether with Pete Cunningham and Roger\nRoessink held out until late in the game when\nAshford scored twice to force a draw. Far be\nit from me to allocate any responsibility but it\nwas really all Simon Gray's fault for hitting\n(he post in the first half!\nTeam: Butter, Roessink, Cunningham,\nWhitehead, Rhodes, Gray, Pitkethly, Stroomer,\nBansal, Wylie, Mitchell.\nThirds\nAshford were a very friendly bunch, except\nfor the big CF with the pathetic beard and\nTony who kept coughing to put off Pete\n(watch his eyes) Sharpe. Craig and Martin sported post-Xmas bum-fluff\u2014even Garms\nhas more hair and Chris Jones played a scorcher and deserves man of the year award.\nEd started his captaincy with a goal (why so\nmany civil engineers with power in HC?). The ladies asked me to include this note\nabout their match:\nOn Saturday we played hockey. F'irst we\ngot on the coach, then we played, then\nMainly scored a goal! Then we got changed.\n.Next we had tea, then we went home.\nTeam: Jones, Sharpe, Cattell, Witter, Shindler,\nta vl or, Allen, Benham, McGuire (Capt).\n(\u00a3j Football\nSevenths\nFrank Bogey-Rolla is the man to blame for\nthe current rash of unorthodox match reports.\nUp until now the Glanville-like insight.*\ninto the tactical ploys adopted by opposition\n(ie shouting offside every time the ball enters\nthe St Thomas' half) was enough to satisfy\nthe reader. However, now they want to be\nentertained.\nConsequently I will just say Tom Donovan\nand guest striker Anton scored.\nPeople in the know reckon this was the\nsecond best sporting performance of the year\nso far. The 20-12 defeat of Wales being the\nma iii hy With the recent thaw IC were able to sail\ntheir first match of the term against City\nUniversity at Queen Mary Reservoir. The\nfirst race started badly but a team effort\nbrought IC up to 2, 3, 4 only to lose due to a collision on the finishing line. In the second\nrace Mills sailed two City boats around the\nwrong side of the start mark and then showed\na clean pair of heels, IC winning 1, 2, 4.\nKennedy and Mills repelled all attackers\nwith close marking in the third to let\nBennett and Dalton skillfully slip through\ninto a comfortable second place to give ICa2,3,4 win and the match.\nTeam: Bennett, Bullet, Dalton, Kennedy,\nMills, Tounghusband.\nBowling\nThe bowling team suffered a disappointing\nhome defeat at the hands of league leaders\nBrunei University last Saturday.\nThere were a number of excellent individual performances for IC, including\npersonal high scores for Neil Grim wood Andy Davis, Kevin Short and Mark Stanley,\nhigh games by Kevin Short(191), Neil Grim wood (174) and Mark Stanley with a magnificent 202, the best ever score by an ICC team player, and good games from Andy McMullan'(221) and Bobby Thong(190), but the strength in depth of the Brunei team\nproved too much for the IC bowlers.\nThe A,B&C teams all managed to take\noAe game from their opponents, the C teams\nvictory in the third game being the first\ninflicted on Brunei C this season, but this was\nnot enough to give IC any league points and\nthis seriously hampers our chances of\nqualifying for the quarter-final stages of the\nUC TBA tournament.\nA Team: Ray Cook, Martin Harrison, W 'ai\nCheong Man, Andy McMullan, Jimmy Tang.\nB team: Andy Davis, Dick Hooper, Kevin\nShort, Bob Thong, Chris Wells.\nC team: Neil Grimwood, Jeffrey Quinn, Dave\nSmith, Martin Smith, Mark Stanley.\nLadies team: Marie Cheong, Sue Hills, Seli\nKazemian, Flaine Scott, Alison Walker.\nNext game is away to Portsmouth Poly on\nSunday, with our final southern zone match\nat Southampton taking place next Wednesday.\nFELIX, January 29, 1982 Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "All My Sons by Arthur Miller, directed by\nMichael Blakemore, Wyndhams Theatre.\nArthur Miller, the contemporary American\nplaywright, is best known for his plays Death\nof a Salesman and The Crucible. All My Sons\nwas his first successful play which immediately\nestablished him as a dramatist of international\nstature.\nThe play's theme, a disturbing but not\naltogether surprising one, was conceived in\nwartime when voices were publicly declaring\nthat all human endeavour was united and of\none purpose: the defeat of the enemy. But\nMiller sensed that little had changed in reality.\nThere were some who were working towards\ntheir own ends. In Miller's words, the play \"was\nan unveiling of what I believed everybody knew\nand nobody publicly said.\"\nThe backyard of the Keller's house in the\nMid-West in the late 1940s sets the scene of\nthe play. The war is over, business is booming\nand wedding plans are nearing completion. But\nan odd wartime incident concerning the\nfather's business in supplying engine parts for\nfighter planes is cruelly resurrected. A consignment of faulty products caused the\ncrash of a squadron, and it is with the shock\ncrash of squadron, and it is with shock that we\ngradually realise that the father knowl ingly allowed the parts to be dispatched in order\nthat his business could continue. This past\nevent has astonishing repercussions as the\nplay unfolds. Suspense and tension increase\nthroughout the drama and these continue in a masterly way with startling and unnerving\nrevelations. The characters are most movingly\nand convincingly portrayed by a strong cast,\nheaded by Colin Blakely and Rosemary Harris.\nNick Bedding\nThe Second Mrs Tanqueray by Arthur\nWing Pinero. Directed by Michael\nRudman, The Lyttelton, National Theatre.\nFelicity Kendal and Leigh Lawson star as the\nill-matched newly-weds in the play, The\nSecond Mrs Tanqueray by the late Victorian\ndramatist, Arthur Pinero. To the incredulity of\nhis friends Aubrey Tanqueray takes as his\nsecond wife one of those women with a' doubtful' pas t so beloved of Victorian dramatists and upon whom they could satisfy\ntheir audiences' vast hunger and thirst for\nmoral retribution. The couple are exiled by\nfashionable London society to deepest Surrey\nwhere Mrs Tanqueray quickly becomes bored.\nShe also becomes jealous of her husband's fondness for his daughter by his first marriage\nand things get even worse when he tries to\nprotect his convent-educated offspring from\nhis wife's\"light, careless nature\". The prick lines s of the situation draws blood when\nthe daughter falls in love with an old flame of\nher mother's. This last scene reaches heights\nof drama and human unpleasantness of an\nintensity and agitation that I have rarely\nexperienced at a play.\nThe play today is still capable of horrifying\nits audience with its reference to men whose\nsexual lives are as bad as those of the fallen\nwomen on whom they prey. The point Pinero\nis making is that the man often gets off lightly\nwhile the woman is treated as a promiscuous\nand venomous parasite.

It seemed at\nfirst to be another one of those English farces\nlike 'No Sex Please-Tve caught it in the\nMousetrap' shows appealing only to grannies,\nthe rent man and accountants, but how wrong\nI was. If you know that you are first in line for\nher will then don't take Auntie to see it, and\ndon't go yourself if you've had a few glasses of\n\"Louis san Wogga-w ogg a\" because you'll need\nall of your brain cells to appreciate this one (a bit like the Orestia and OTT). We are introduced to the family of Lord\nCharles( deceased to be) Conservative Secretary of State for Defence, unfortunately\nLord Charles lies in an alum in is ed. computer-controlled, coffin-like casket upstage and has\nabout as much action left in him as an episode\nfrom Crossroads. Most of the family appears\nto spend the morning playing a game which\ninvolves counting the day's death-toll in each\nof their newspapers the winner being the one\nto have found the greatest number (the bad\ntaste depreciates from here on in). The highlight of the sherry, followed by the\ntermination of Lord Charles by a ceremonial\nswitch-off (Described as, \"...electrocution in\nreverse\") then sherry to follow. The normality\n\"fetch the men in the white coats\" borderline\nbegins to get very thin from now on and in the\nwords of Lady Charles' Buddhist-vegetarian Oxford Uni son Nigel we become \"...even\nuncertain about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle...\"\nWe are then confronted by the press, played\nby Peter Jones (of Hitchikers Guide to the\nGalaxy fame), a Conservative back-ben cher( John Saunders), the mandatory Police, Inspector played by Terence Bayler (Leggy\nMountbatten in another of Idle's creations,\nThe Ruttles) and the odd Mala prop ian muttering s of Beryl Cooke as Kitty.\nThe second half of the play (rivalled only I think by the NT's On the Razzle) led me into\ncycles of bellyaching laughter when I discovered that all was not as it seemed. We\ndiscover that due to an item in a glass jar on a shelf in North Africa, Lady Charles (played by\nMadge Ryan) is not the Lady Charles that she\nat first appears to be, that her twins Hugo and\nAnabelle are 39 and 28 years old respectively,\nthat someone in the house has been leaking\nmilitary secrets to the Soviets and two Scottish\nparanoids t wise the tumblers and unlock a box\nfull of intrigue that even Pandora could have\nresisted.\nThe cast is superbly suited to the maniacal\nhumour of Idle, with John Fortune as Butler\n(the butler) and Willy Rushton's upper-twit\nHugo blending well into the flow. The action in\nthe first half did appear a little disjointed, and\nsome of the timing of the second act needs to\nbe polished up a little but no doubt when the\ncast has settled in to their new surroundings\n(the play is a transfer ral from its success in\nCambridge) Peter Jones' karate routine and\nJohn Saunders' rather mechanistic dialogue\nwill improve the general flow....but remember\nAuntie's will and tuck her up in bed before yuu\nleave for the show!\nAndy Best\nAida by Giuseppe Verdi, English National\nOpera at the London Coliseum.\nAida is the \"grandest of the grand operas\" and\nusually requires management with grand\ndetermination (and grand amounts of money)\nto stage.

    "content": "\"I'm certainly stupid\nat times\nAn interview with Mr Barney McCabe\nCan you outline briefly your role as Deputy President? There is a brief outline in the official published job description, but that doesn't really account accurately for the time I spend. My main responsibility is the Union Building, the fit ment s, the furnishings, the decorations, etc., etc., for which I have the House Committee, which is supposed to be the major decision making body and I'm meant to get their decisions implemented. Do you decide on allocation of resources, i.e. if someone comes to you do you decide on the merits of that application? Strictly speaking, House Committee allocates these things, e.g. cupboards, etc. I can just make decisions straight off on small purchases \u2014 they' ve actually delegated some responsibility to me.An interesting point is,\nthat in the byelaws, when it comes to allocating rooms for societies or club s,I'm the only person responsible for that. A lot of the decisions though are on precedent, tradition. Why did you stand as Deputy President? Why didI stand? If you want a straight answer, I suppose it's because I knew I would win. Why did you want to win? Well, we all like winning, don't we? What were your objectives, what did you want to achieve? I think my objectives were n't specifically to I CU.I have certain objectives which I can't clearly define, which I want to achieve in my lifetime, and Is aw Deputy President of ICU as merely one way in which I could fulfill some of those objectives. Because I knew I could win, I stood. Did you want to be of service to IC? Wanting to be of service to fellow humans, yes, specifically IC, no, other than in that Iam a student here, and that my job requires that Ido things for other people. So, bearing in mind that I 've taken this job then, yes, I want to do things for IC \u2014 its students. Did you have any objectives when you started? Any specific plans? I'm interested in buildings in a sense,I like making rooms nice, so that was one of the nice things about the job. One of the area in the Union which I really want to do something with, and still do, is the Gents bogs, which are disgusting really, decrepit, you can do little\nrepairs on them all the time \u2014 they were designed for use in the building when it was being used in a different way to how it is now. Because they don't fit today's functions they' re not respected as much as they ought to be. But hopefully we'll get something do en about those by the end of the year. Are you succeeding in the tasks that you' ve set yourself? Well, I 've only outlined one task which Is et myself, I suppose there are others. In generalI don't think I 've achieved nearly as much as I wanted to. In terms of doing the actual job,I think I have, I don't think I could do any better than I have been, but the things I was going to do in addition to being Deputy President, I have n't achieved. I have n't had time, because the job's been so demanding. What are the major demands of the job? Mainly time. It's all the little things that you have to do? For instance? Well, I'm not only responsible for seeing that\na room is booked out to an organisation, you have to check that they' ve cleared it up so you don't have to retain some of their deposit because they didn't clear up. Then you find that they didn't have any cleaning materials, so you have togo over to central stores and you get lots of in t eruptions all the time.... you have to carry your money over to the bank or look after the vending machines \u2014 ah! Don't mention the vending machines. They keep getting broken into. We' ve just about stopped it now, it doesn't happen so much anymore. It\nhas n't happened since we came back this term, you have to empty them quite regularly \u2014 it's a pain in the arse, it really is.\nHow much money do you have control over? Not you specifically, but you, the House Committee, etc? Essentially the Finance Committee has control overall the Union's money, which this year is about \u00a3220,000 by the end of the year.\nHow much are you paid per year? I get the full grant for a postgraduate student, plus a free room. That works out at about \u00a353\na week for the grant and the room about \u00a323.\nYou' ve been described as lazy, inefficient and stupid, do you agree?( Quote Nick Morton)\nHe called me that! Well, when you come to interviewing him \u2014 no forget it. Well, I'm certainly stupid at times, because I let things annoy me which I should stay cool about. I'm certainly lazy, as everybody who knows me and has worked with me knows. I wouldn't deny that at other time sI'm certainly not lazy \u2014 it really depends on how interested Iam. As for inefficient \u2014 I would contest that\nmon st strongly \u2014 I'm certainly not inefficient. I'm going to mention just one word, and would like you to give me a short answer. The issue is politics. POLAND. Marco went to Poland at Christmas. Urn, I think it's possibly going to be a confrontation place between America and Russia, but I think that things could happen if the European states got together and supported the very\nstrong American stance. I think that the Russians are likely togo along way towards releasing the Solidarity members and perhaps increasing the freedom of the people of Poland. He called me that!\nBarney (Bernadette to close friends) relaxing in\nstunning blue chiffon.\nApartheid I don't support any constitutional desc rim in a tion between races, but I think that the eventual solution in SA should be obtained by peaceful methods. I think it might take a hundred years but I think a hundred years of peace with black people from neighbouring countries still preferring to live in South Africa, because they get a better deal there than in their anarchic regime, and Mh ink if it\ntakes a hundred years, it's worth the peace and stability that SA had, but I would like to see apartheid obliterated.\nFeminism Feminism\u2014women's lib. Obviously women have a certain amount of.... they' ve been laughed at as useful members of society and that is useful in a capacity other than raising children, etc. I'm quite in favour of equal opportunities for women and men. I still tend to hold doors open for ladies\u2014for women. I hold doors open for blok es as well though. There's a nice bit of traditional chivalry which I like. As a man I don't think I'm doing it to be condescending to woman its merely to feel\nthat I'm maintaining some nice bits of British heritage. I'm not in favour of any kind of desc rim i nation against women. In fact I remember being quite outspoken on this subject when it came up in school. What do you think of the10:1 ratio of men to women a tIC? Well over my time at College, I 've seen the ratio improve each year, and I 've also seen life\nat the College improve, although that might be because I'm more able to accept the unbalanced situation. I think it's an awful shame that there are a lot of men here, who will go out of College with a completely wrong view of what women are like, simply because they have never lived in an environment with women of their age \u2014 they might have come from a single sex school. I think the same applies to women; I think it's a shame that women come out of this place having a lot of attention from blok es here, and they can suffer when they leave, because the outside world is very different.\nWhat do you think of the move for positive discrimination of blacks? I 've not heard it described apart from sensationalism in the press as positive discrimination. I don't think it is actually. People who were from deprived inner city areas had a lack of certain kinds of formal qualification to enter IC. The people that will be accepted, will certainly be accepted on any other basis.\nHow many hours do you put in a week? It varies but I suppose I average9 to5 for a5 day week, but there are exceptions. Page 6 FELIX, January 29, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "This article will attempt to wake up those\nof you who are half asleep. For those of\nyou whose eyelid has flickered slightly\nhoping this is a happy alternative to a Friday morning boring lecture I hasten to\nsay that this is not what I mean by \"half\nasleep\", though you will notice when\nreading this article that the chances are\nyou are included somewhere in it.\nMy starting point is the recent lecture given\nby the Deputy Secretary General of the\nCommonwealth M rE.C. Anyaoku entitled\n\" New Nations: Making Independence a Reality\" (for a summary and comments on\nwhich you will have to wait for the next\nFELIX). What struck me is that there were\nabout forty people in the audience. Now forty\npeople do not make an unsuccessful lecture,\nthough they do not either make a successful\none. When coming to this College some years\nago I was aware that scientists are a very dull\nlot, but a glance through the activities of the IC\nstudent population gave me some hope. I saw\namong other things a Communist society,\nSocialist society, Labour club, Conservative\nsociety, Overseas Students committee , a Christian society, Islamic society, IC Women's association, and so on. I also saw a president\nof IC Union being the president of NUS and a FELIX Editor being an Editor of Sennet (now\ncalled London Student). I further saw a College committee on overseas students, a Delhi committee, and even a counselor for\noverseas students. In my time a department of\nhumanities evolved to interrelate scientific and\nphilosophical thought. I then went on to see\nthat there was a wine tasting society, a real ale\nsociety, an astrological society, a Wells society, a stamp club, a the l tics and national\nclubs, a radio club, a students television and\neven a students newspaper in which every\nmember of College could voice his opinion. I must confess I was pleased. It seemed that IC\nwas not producing cold blinkered scientists of\noutstanding merit. It was actually producing\nscientists of ou standing merit with a balanced\nopinion all the advantages and disadvantages\nof their scientific work and aware of most of\nthe positive and negative social consequences\nof it. One thing that gave me further hope was\nthe inclusion in every engineering course of\nwhat was termed \"associated studies\". At the\ntime, you see, I was not aware they were\ncompulsory nor did I realise they needed to\nbe compulsory.\nSlowly but steadily my opinion reverted to\none I had before coming to IC. I am now\nconvinced that IC is so apathetic that IC\ngraduates are in the long run a threat to\nsociety. It troubles me to think that the\nmajority is not in fact d is orientated, but\nun orientated. But let me return to the lecture I mentioned\nabove. It will be seen from the title of the talk\nthat both Mrs S. Williams MP and MrE. Heath\nMP have given lectures on the same topic. For\nthose of you who are not even aware of these\nlectures I am referring to topics stem ing from\nthe Brandt Report with which both speakers\nhave dealt with. For those of you who are not\nScientists Rule KO\nby N Lambrou\naware of either the Brandt Report nor the\nAlternative Brandt. I confess you have reached\ntoo far in this article\u2014please go back to sleep.\nWhen these two distinguished guests delivered\ntheir lectures they did so in \"standing room\"\nconditions. When their lectures ended they\nwere vigorously applauded. I had to presume\nthat their message had got through. Alas, this\nwas not the case. Some of you may remember\nthat their message was one of alarm and need\nof understanding and co-operation between all\nmodern nations. The absence of a large\naudience in the Deputy Secretary's lecture\nshowed that this message had not got through.\nWe had with us a very distinguished guest who\nhad honoured us in agreeing to give a lecture\nwhich would further our understanding of the\ndeveloping world and the ideas we have about\nit. Where was Mr Heath's and Mrs Williams'\naudience then? Where were the at least 1,000\nstudents who actually come from the\nCommonwealth? Where were the Communist\nSociety members who pledge awareness about\nthe world? Where were the Labour Society\nmembers who pledge solidarity to every\nthink able and unthinkable cause? Where were\nthe Conservative Society members\u2014wet or\ndry\u2014whose forefathers created the Commonwealth? Where were the religious society\nmembers who are so touched after disaster\nhas stricken some unfortunate country?\n1 personally cannot answer these questions.\nWhat I can see though is that Mr Heath's and\nMrs Williams' audience did not attend their\nlectures to listen to what they had to say. They\nwere simply there to admire sheepishly two of\ntheir leaders. They will also be there to attack\nthem, somewhere in the flock, if and when\nthey make what they wii ll have been led, rightly\nor wrongly, to think of as a mistake.\nYou may be aware that Imperial College was\noriginally created to produce scientists and\nengineers of international calibre whose\nultimate purpose was to spread into the British\nEmpire and industrial is e every remote corner\nof the globe. The general idea seems to have\nbeen one in which Britain was naturally on\ntop in the development of the world with\nobvious financial, cultural and political benefit\nto everyone concerned. The ideal seems also\nto have been similar. Britain would be carrying.\nthe torch of knowledge throughout the world,\nthus making it certain that history would\nhonour ably judge her. Unfortunately recent\npolitical ideas as well as uncountable occasions\nof the action being different from the thought\nhave sunk both the idea and the ideal.\nNevertheless. Imperial College has suffered\nthe least from all this. It still maintains a high\nproportion of overseas students and still has\nmembers from various commonwealth countries in its body of governors. What is\nnow happening at IC seems to be melting away\nthe last chance for both Britain to prevail and\nthe ideal of world co-operation (and hence\nsuccess) to stay alive. In one world the answer\nis apathy (which I see from FELIX602 was\npointed out by the then FELIX Editor fourteen\nyears ago!). What makes this word even more\nalarming is that it crops up in an exclusively\ntechnological college of high standard while we\nare living in a technological age!\nBut don't alarm yourselves (your lecture\nhour is still going and your lecturer, however\ncompetent, cannot be more interesting than\nthe approaching weekend). Others have\nsuffered the same fate in history. The Greek\ncivilisation, the Roman Empire and the Arab\nworld all collapsed due to this magic word.\nThere seems no reason why the British Empire\nwould be able to maintain its peak, even\nthough students of history have repeatedly\ndeveloped sore throats shouting out their\nfindings. Unfortunately for them and you they\nwere not scientists so they did not apply\n\"scientific rig our\" in their arguments. It was\njust feelings and their predictions were wrong\nby time factors of up to centuries! Iam informed they are now trying harder to achieve\nmore \"sci ent if c\" accuracy for it is this, and\nonly this, which scientists appreciate and\nunderstand. Otherwise, it is their fate to ask\nunanswerable questions and thus \"torture\"\nthemselves. Scientists do not tend to ask such\nquestions and so proceed to a quieter life\nwhich does not involve any inner passion. I envy you for your inability to ask yourselves\nquestions about \" ideals\",\" purpose\", and \"ambition\", for you lead, in this way, simple\nlives with no questions to burn you inside out. I also pity you for the same reason for your\nproblems become petty and out of context,\nI would like to end this outburst with a statistic you may understand. A human being\nsleeps approximately 2700 hours per year.\nSacrificing one hour to further your knowledge\nabout the world constitutes a sacrifice of\n0 . 0 0 0 4 % , all calculations being within engineering accuracy.\nN. Lambrou\nVice-Chairman, OSC\nFELIX, January 29, 1982 Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Sour Cream\nI must say that I am surprised by the response\nof the 22 Club to Mr Marshall's Soapbox\narticle (see letters page). That they choose to\ndefend themselves is not surprising, but to try\nand defend the sordid actions of Mr\nThompson by denying matters of in des put able fact is unwise. As a witness to the event which\nprompted Mr Marshall's article I am in a position to assess the factual content myself. 1\ncould not have printed such allegations if I had\nnot been able to confirm their validity.\nAs for his own interpretations and\nconclusions about the results of such actions, I for one agree with his main point, i.e. that the\nindulgence of excesses in public can only serve\nto damage the reputation of the College as a whole. Those people who are proud of the\nRCS (as the 22 Club members undoubtedly\nare) should try to prevent such excesses from\nre-occurring by not supporting the loud and\nabusive behaviour which inevitably leads to\nsuch events.\nThe fact that the need was felt to write such\nan article must surely indicate that there really\nis a problem. It's no use denying it, so why\nbother.\nBored Stiff\nI'm not surprised that Tuesday'sU GM was\nin quo rate. Fristly the Exec News produced\nlast week was hardly inspiring. The one motion\nwhich was included proved to be pointless and\ntotally uninspiring, which would hardly\nencourage people to attend.\nIt was stupid to censure Barney McCabe\nfor late arrival, and not take advantage of the\nsituation to question his ridiculous report.\nWhat about a no-confidence motion next time,\ninstead of this weak \"censure\" approach all the\ntime?\nI think it is indicative of the failings of this\nyear's Executive that UGMs so far have had to\nrely on Rag Mag motions to maintain quo racy. If there are no worthwhile motions it is either\nbecause a stimulus from them is not there or\nthat they are incapable of proposing motions\nthemselves. The primary example was the\ntoken opposition to the recent increases for\nHalls and Houses this term. Despite the fact\nthat ICU Council has policy against mid-session al increases, not one of the Executive\nconsidered stiff opposition to the rent\nincreases or even a rent strike. When I asked\nNick Morton why he didn't consider a rent\nstrike he said \"Nobody proposed one.\" If we\ncannot rely on the President to lead, who will?\nBig Equipment\nOn Wednesday Mr Pallab Ghosh walked into\nthe FELIX Office and proudly announced \"I'm after 8mm equipment.\" He was somewhat\nperplexed by the convulsions of laughter\nwhich ensued and proceeded to explain that\nhe was talking about equipment for the Film\nSociety which may be set up next year.

    "content": "Going it alone\nOn January 4 the Holland Club re-opened for the new term with\nits own cook to run the catering service, after Mr Mooney decided\nto close his outlet in the building.\nMany students entering the Huxley Building from the JCR walkway will\nhave noticed the entrance to the Holland Club and may have wondered\nwhat this organisation is all about.\nThe Holland Club was founded to provide social facilities, equivalent to\nthe Senior and Junior Common Rooms, for the non-teaching staff of the\nCollege. It was based for many years in Princes Gardens and occupied a house with its own catering and bar facilities.\nWhen the house was needed for alternative purposes, the Club was left\nwithout premises for many years until they were given the extension at\nthe back of the Huxley Building in October 1976. In these premises the\nbar and catering facilities were run by Mr Mooney.\no It soon became apparent to the committee of 13 that Mr Mooney was\ntreating the Holland Club badly. The food was often poor and they felt\nthat as they were providing social facilities (including snooker, pool,\ndarts, table tennis, etc.) and trying to attract new members, that the food\nwas a problem. Indeed, they wished to take it over themselves to improve\nit.\nThe first move was to approach several outside caterers for an\nestimate. Two offers seemed attractive and were about to be acted upon\nwhen two major setbacks happened.\nFirstly large cracks were found in the structure of the building along\nwith damp patches. As it then became uncertain how long the building\ncould be used safely, it was impossible to contact an outside caterer.\nThen, shortly before Christmas 1981, Mr Mooney announced that he\nwould be discontinuing the Holland Club service after the end of the\nautumn term. This left a bare six weeks to re-organise the catering\narrangements if the club wished to maintain the facility and operate it\nfrom the start of 1982.\nTheir decision to employ a former chemist y technician, Mr Alfred\nColeman and his wife to run the kitchen. Mr Coleman had previously\nbeen a cook (many years ago) and as a Holland Club member himself\nwas interested to help. To assist him, volunteers from the Committee\nwere enrolled to take money and do some of the cleaning.\nSo far the experiment seems to be a success. When I ate there on\nTuesday the service was impressive. Not only was the serving area\nmeticulously clean, but the food was hot, served on warm plates and\nmost enjoyable. The standard of food is certainly equivalent and probably\nbetter than Mr Mooney at his best. There is a mixture of frozen and\nfreshly prepared dishes which, if maintained and improved, could mean\nthat the non-teaching staff will have established in three weeks what Mr\nMooney failed to do in five years; provide a catering facility with food of\nan acceptable standard which is profitable.\nThe Holland Club is only open to the members (about 900 of them) and\ntheir guests. So if you know a friendly technician, secretary or other non-teaching staff member, it might be worthwhile asking them to take you\nalong.\nMark Smith\nr Hair by\np fig las Hairdressing for men and women20% reduction on\nproduction of a Unioncard\n68 GLOUCESTER ROAD LONDON S.W.7.

In Imperial College there is a Chaplaincy\ngroup which meets regularly each week (usually over a meal) in most\ndepartments and halls of residence.\nDuring Contact Week a team of people whose photographs you see\nbelow are coming to the colleges as guests of the Chaplaincy groups\nwhich meet there. They will be living in halls of residence and working\nwith the groups that meet there and in the various departments. The\naim of the week is to deepen the life of the Chaplaincy groups, to invite\nothers to become involved in the groups and to encourage wider\ndiscussion and debate within the halls and departments. A number of\ninformal discussions involving the Contact Week team members will be\ntaking place throughout the week in most halls and departments in\nImperial College and in the other two colleges.

To repay these loans the\nCollege are committed to an agreement, whereby an amount is payed\nback to the breweries every time a barrel of their beer is sold.\nAlterations were started in the Christmas vacation and as deadline*\nwere not met by the contra tors, it was necessary lor them to work\nextremely hard to compete the majority of the work on time.\nAn added complication for the bar manager Mr Ian Harold Magna y, was that the cooling fan in the beer cellar broke down las i weekend.

While\nmany students applying for these\nrebates may have been disappointed by the low level of\nbenefit, or even complete lack of it\nduring term time, many will find\nthat they do quality for a reasonable amount during vacation.

This project has been on the 'back burner' for about\neighteen months now, the delay being caused mainly by British Telecom's tardiness in installing the required music-quality telephone\nline. However, this installation has now taken place, and we are currently\nin the process of constructing the required line amplifiers and isolation\nequipment. Basically we pay for the electronics at our end, and the line\ntermination circuitry at the Evelyn Gardens end; the houses themselves\npay for the loudspeakers and loudspeaker amplifiers. Projected completion date is the end of this term (i.e. there's a lot of work still to\ndo).\nThe other main subject worthy of note at this time is that many people\nstill cannot pick up IC Radio. A problem certainly; an explanation follows.\nSouthside residents are theoretically able to tune in to the medium wave\ntransmitter on 301m(999 kHz). Many say they can't; it's hardly\nsurprising considering the number of power lines within the building and\nthe primary building material \u2014 ferro concrete( not noted for its\ntransparency to radio frequencies). The best we can offer is to suggest\nyou site your radio close to the washbasin in your room where the signal\nis usually stronger. Unfortunately home office regulations forbid us from\nusing, say, a2k linear amplifier (like the one Hamsoc's got) and thus\nreaching Hammersmith or other such areas. All the above also applies to\nLinstead Hall, incidentally.\n'All this is very spiffy,' you may well say (it's unlikely) 'but what about\nprogrammes?' Well, this is where YOU come in. We are always looking\nfor DJs; at the moment there are vacancies (lots) for people at weekends\nand late at night weekdays (10:00-12:00pm). No prior experience is\nrequired\u2014any numbskull can do it (!). Why not join us? Enquire at our\nSouthside Office (by the shop) any weekday lunchtime or in the evenings.\nAlso technical people are needed\u2014preferably with some knowledge of\nelectronics.\nSF Soc\nLeechlike, the tall thin SF Bulletin\nthis week gives nothing away, but\ninstead taps the mental shoulder\nof creative members of the society\nin regard to the approaching publication of the magazine some\ncall NME3, an infamous fanzine\nwhose origins lie lost in the mists\nof two years ago, and with a ban sheepish smile asks that all\npeople who wish their work to be\nconsidered for its pages have very\nlittle time left to give it to the\neditor, be it fact, fiction, artwork\nor whatever else their fevered\nimaginations can invent. And you\nthought they didn't write sentences like that any more. Anyway,\nif you can cabbie together prose\nbetter than the above don't hide\nyour pen under a bushel, instead\nrush your self-expression to Elise\nPechersley, Physics 3, and she will\ngive it whatever treatment occurs\nto her. You have until next Friday,\ndog willing. So long, and remember only Batman can climb walls. If\nyou should try it \u2014 gosh \u2014 holy broken bones.\nThe Butler-Soft Brain of Norman\nMaine\nCommunity Action\nWell, you MUST have settled\ndown into College life by now, so,\nto all those people who showed\ninterest at Freshers' Fair, we've\nnow got several projects running.\nCome forward, and show your-selves. Come to our meetings at\n12:30pm on Monday at the top of\nthe Union. Free coffee!\nWe need help with an old peoples' home( evenings), St.\nPancras Hospital patients, handicapped children (Saturday after-noon s), soup runs (Tuesday and\nFriday evenings), draught proofing homes ( Wednesday afternoon)\nand with battered wives and children( Saturday, February6 \u2014taking them out for a trip).\nEnts\nAn act of God prevented 'Overkill'\nfrom playing here last term...was\nhe trying to tell us something?\nFind out tonight in the lower\nrefectory\u2014only \u00a31 which includes\na bar, two bands and a hard rock\nmega sound system; which goes to\nshow that we cater for ALL tastes!\nOn February 14....yes! THAT day! We hope to see you all in the\nJ CR for a rather special nocturnal\nhappening\u2014\"the IC/IF Valentines\nParty\". A superb jazz/funk band is\nbeing arranged. Yes! you guessed\nit\u2014only \u00a31 a ticket.\nMore dates for your diary: Feb\n19 Links Carnival with a return\nvisit from the loveable Flying\nPadova n is, plus many other attractions and, of course, every\nThursday evening in ME220 (next\nto the list of Star Trek).\nLiberal\nLast week's Guildsheet writing\nabout the cut in student grants\nclaimed that \"those who believe\nthat things will change under\nanother government, however,\nwill be in for a shock.\" Is there an\nalternative to the present govern-ment's disastrous higher education\npolicy? Find out by coming to hear\nshadow cabinet member and opposition education spokesman,\nNeil Kinnock MP on Tuesday,\nFebruary 2 in ME220 at 1:00pm. The postponed meeting to elect\nNO LS conference delegates and\nsubmit amendments to conference\nmotions will be on Thursday, February4, at 1:00pm in the\nUnion Upper Lounge. As an\nadded incentive to attend we will\nbe discussing whether to challenge\nthe NO LS Standing Orders Committee's decision that one of\nour two conference motions was\ninvalid.\nSocialist\nImperial College faces cuts in\nexpenditure of 20% in the next\nthree years which will impair the\nquality of research and education.\nColleges of higher education and\npolytechnics face cuts of up to\n16% next year. In other areas,\nparents now have to pay for the\neducation of their mentally handicapped children, thousands\nof O APs die of cold related diseases, military spending increases and new scapegoats are.\nfound (wreckers in industry, bad\nteachers in education, blacks and\nlefties in street riots); unemployment increases, things are bad\nand getting worse.\nIf you are apolitical then you\ndon't care about the above, you\ndon't care about injustice, at least\nnot enough to get off your a Tse and do something. Our student\nleaders with their popularity politics don't give a damn, and\nwhen, probably at Easter, staff\nredundancies are announced, the\nstudent union will do nothing to\nsupport the striking ASTM S workers, perhaps our union officers should be made redundant\nin sympathy.\nIf you think we should be doing\nsomething substantive to oppose\neducation cuts; if you think the\ntime has come for an end to the\nunion's apolitical stance and a firm\nstand against moral injustice, then\ncome to a meeting today at\n1 : 0 0 pm in the Union Upper Lounge.\nSnooker\nAfter an extension of holiday\nfestivities, we finally got around to\nplaying some matches last week.\nThe A team had a good away\nvictory at LSE, beating their A team 4-1, while back home the B and C teams were in devastating\nform. The B team confidently\ndealt with a three man outfit from\nBedford, just doing enough to win\n5-0. It was drinks all round for the\njubilant C team when Holt came\nfrom behind against his opponent\nto force home a stunning victory\nto out his side one up, as Paul was\nin his usual generous mood which\nhe saves for snooker nights. The\nmerry-making continued until a41 victory was ensured, give or take\na few mis-hap s along the way.\nThe open and handicap tournaments are progressing nicely, and\nhave produced some classic matches already. The infamous\nBricknell gave Tripp a scare in the\nhandicap, potting some balls with\nshots that not many people would\nhave thought of, but Trip p, recovered in time to squeeze through 2-1. Calvert managed to\novercome a28 point deficit against\nAlgy to win a match that everyone\nwas interested in. Jennings fluke d victory against an unlucky Batorijs\nin the open, and that man Holt\ncontinues to defy the odds by\nmarking in the same competition.\nKeep watching the noticeboards\nfor more up-to-the-minute information and results.\nWellsoc\nWe're back! Sorry we've been away for the past few Mondays, we've had\nproblems with lecturers cancelling at short notice. Anyhow that's behind\nus and we're back with aven gence. Lectures are organised for Monday evenings as usual. Highlights include\na professional magician from the Magic Circle, who will be talking about\nthe life of Houdini before doing his stage act.

A visit to the under world is being organised. That is to say, we've\narranged sittings with mediums for anyone who wants to find out about\nthe supernatural or get in touch with the undead.
